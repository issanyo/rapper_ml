[Post Hook: Mann]

All I know is this
Fuck the Politics
I'mma be a millionaire before I call it quits
You gone always see me shaded with a model bitch
I'mma Always be the Man as long as I exist Yump

[Verse 1: Mann]

Look I got it, Money in my wallet
Whip I bought it, and my bitch exotic
And I've been swimming in that aquatic
My rims looking brolic, give them niggas no option
When I Pull up, all them hoes be droolin
I ain't tripping, im just shaded im coolin
Yo bitch be hittin me like "What you doing"
And I be like "nothing, come through and smoking something"
You know whats up
She just want to be around a nigga who dope as fuck
She hang around even though she know there is no hope for us
I hit her with the "you already, knew what it was
I had fun but I'm through with it love" hahaha
I had to laugh, because the only thing I'm afters cash
From west la where them young niggas play snatch and grab
Get'cha chain ganked, pawn that thang just to make bank
Where it ain't safe, only way out is to make cake
I know how it is, I'm from the city, coming off the ave
When stars hit roscoes we don't ask for autographs
Star struck? na'll bra. Where them dollars at
I need a lot of cash, because you know just what we gotta have

[Hook: Mann]

The money The money The money The money
The money The money The money The money
The money The money The money The money
The money The money The money The money

All I know is this
Fuck the Politics
I'mma be a millionaire before I call it quits
You gone always see me shaded with a model bitch
I'mma Always be the Man as long as I exist Yump

[Verse 2: Mann]

Calling all Gs, Calling all G's
When I was young I knew money wasn't falling off trees
Mama couldn't give 5 dollars for lunch
Never wanted to get dropped off in the front
Riding in a bucket, single parent struggling
12 years old said fuck it and started hustling
Selling dub sacks that I got from my cousin
I was in Jr High getting niggas super high
Knew what I was doing learned the hustler mentality
Loyalty needed for anyone who want to be down with me
Supply and demand, make sure you give them quality
The best is what it got to be can't give em nothing less
Now Im doing the same thing putting on for the West
Music so wet, got baddies on deck
Bang dannon all day fuck everything else
Hating on us then they playing they self
Payed 650 for the hermes belt
Thats money you'll never see like a mermaids tail
Its 2012 time to keep it real
Been doing myself feeling like fuck a deal

[Hook: Mann]

[Bridge: Mann}

Money I got it, Money I got it
Money I got it, Money I got it
West La Get the dough all day
West La get the dough all day
2x
