[Intro]
Forever and ever
Wherever whenever, no matter the weather
I promise I gotcha
Will never forget ya, will never neglect ya
My life has been better now that I gotcha

[Hook]
Come lay in this garden of flowers
We can get lost in the hour
And if I get caught in the shower, she let her nature flow
Her water makes her grow (x4)

[Verse]
I love it when we get physical
I love to see you when you in no clothes
I love it when you talk spiritual
Two indigos making love on the kitchen floor
We getting poppin in the strangest places
The sex is good, the head game amazing
It feel too good, baby change the place up
Pulling on the dress, she fucking up her make up

[Hook]

[Verse]
They focused on music, they focused on choosing
She sweet as a fruit is a freak when we do it
We under influence, we over the limit
We perfectly balanced, tell Uber come get us
We home and I killed it, put your feet to the ceiling
I gave her that good dick, now she's in the feeling
She think that I'm brilliant, I think she appealing
We both so righteous, we seeking [?]
She wishin on a star, she got ambition
Now think baby going far, she going far
She keep that pussy up to par
You good girl I like how you know who you are
Baby, bring on [?] this is our way
You looking for you love, girl I got it all day
I fuck with you the long way, may take you to the park and do it in broad day

[Hook]

(x2)
Forever and ever
Wherever whenever, no matter the weather
I promise I gotcha
Will never forget ya, will never neglect ya
My life has been better now that I gotcha

[Outro]
