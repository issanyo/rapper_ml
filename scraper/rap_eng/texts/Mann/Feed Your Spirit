[Intro]

I'mma do it with rappin
Got signed at 16, uh

[Verse:1 Mann]

Im a child of god
Been one since the day I arrived
'91 17th of July
When I was born I needed a piece of the pie, 'cuz
Moms struggling, uncle hustling, and my aunt ain't keeping a job
Me and My cousin only mission in this bitch was to even the odds
Keep Striving, Even when I didn't even know where I was going
Started acting at 5, at 14 I start flowing
I'mma Make it out of this trap Mama
And I'mma do it with Rappin'
Got signed at 16
Wasn't surprised because I knew it would happen
Had a vision and then I put it in action
Next mission is to get us a mansion
For my mom, and my cousin, and my grandma to live in you couldn't imagine
How good it feels to be feeding your family
Ending all these generational curses
To be fully conscious and to really know that you live with a purpose
Man I've been different since back in school
Not a slave to the dough bro its just a tool
So the money women cars and clothes
All for the show, mind on the goal, and my soul never sold

[Hook: Mann]

Fuck the world
And everything in it
You can attack my flesh
You can't fade my spirit
Yeah

Fuck the world
And everything in it
You can attack my flesh
Can't fade my spirit
Yeah

[Verse:2 Mann]

Its time to grow
Change don't happen when your comfortable
Fuck the games and all the mind control
There are some things a nigga want to know, like
Why you move my people out the hood?
And why the rent gettin steeper in numbers?
Whats the secret and why you keeping it from us?
Shhh be quiet because there is evil among us
When we were younger we ain't pay it no mind
Now that im grown I can't ignore those signs
We living in the most horrible times
But forced to act like the world is just fine
Either I'm making a difference by speaking on it
Or Im going crazy
But Either way this whats on my heart
And this is how I've been feeling lately
Can you blame me, for wanting y'all to see it how I see it
Take it with a grain of salt or leave it
The world is cold or nigga Im anemic
And I don't even know what I believe in
All I know, is by the time my spirit leaves this earth
And my body's buried in the dirt
I did every deed of my god given work, word

[Hook]

[Bridge]

Turn the lights low
Real shit man
This is how I feel, this what Ive been thinking about
Realizing shit
You create your own reality man
We are in the world, but we are not of the world
Mann, Yump

[Hook]
