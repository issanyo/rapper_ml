[Chorus: Kid Ink]
I ain't got a care in the world tonight
We really ain't worried about nothing
Had a long day all my life
I been waiting for this moment
So I gotta live it up, live it up, live live it up
Live it up, live it up, live live it up
Live it up, live it up, live live it up
Live it up, live it up, live live it up

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Okay, bitch what's happening? Heard your boyfriend's cheap like plastic
We ain't in the same demographic, you know I gotta do it Jurassic
Now, toast to the young and the reckless, no drama like the Young and Restless
Thank God then I roll up breakfast, fat boy roll up seconds
Hello, goodnight, might tip her if she look right
Just keep on dancing, money talking, I keep on rambling
Elephant in the room I'm mammoth, I'mma take my chances
Go hard or go home, it could just be the Patron but

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Chrishan]
Living it up, see me shaded up in the cut
Women with us with a lil something in my cup
Not giving a fuck you remember us
Yeah we looking different, huh cause our digits up super cheese
Hella racks, what I'mma do with these
Spend it all on fast cars, clothes and jewellery
I'mma do it like I do my trees blew it
She foolish if she ask we'll see everywhere it'll be like two or three
But everybody who know what's up, they what's up
They see that BDMCG and they know it's us
We toasting for our success, so pour a cup and pour it out
Fuck the OGs who did it before us
For all the homies who past that be getting this cake
And every inhale I take say I did it for Nate
Life is too short
So everyday we celebrate like it's our ink day

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
Yeah, like it ain't no tomorrow, I'm just tryna forgot my sorrows
Hand on her waist other hand on the bottle, tell 'em dream or die is the motto
Up all night, no sleep 'til the morning, really wish I could seize this moment
Hi to the haters, greet my opponent, if you ain't already notice

[Chorus]
