[Verse 1]
Bentley thoughts with a mansion ambition
Luxury living with a chef in Mann's kitchen
It's me against life like I'm facing a grand sentence
Goal in my career is making a damn difference
Changing the game sounding so cliche
What you know about everyday being your b-day?
Cuz, we see cake every one of these weekdays or weekends
Never the getting money streak ends
And I'm the shit nigga, no depends
Life full of BS and phony friends
If your wallet ain't fat you got bony ends
And my chickas never nickles, only tens
Oh no he didn't, yes I did
I'm the West LA kid and I rep my clique
Nobody over I, like eyelids
I'm O-N fool, and I'm feeling like this

[Hook]
And we don't stop, never gon' stop
We ain't gon' stop until we on top, you know
Never gon' stop, never gon' stop
We ain't gon' stop until we on top, you know
And we don't stop, never gon' stop
We ain't gon' stop until we on top, you know
Never gon' stop, we ain't gon' stop
Even when we on top, we still ain't gon' stop

[Verse 2]
Came a long way from recording in the closet
Never thought it could happen to be honest
Who getting famous off rapping? Dijon is
That's crazy, but my job I beez on it
Never gon' quit, even though
I'm not gon' lie, I was thinking 'bout it a week ago
The game fickle, hard to be an individual
The first door around being I did what I didn't do
But I'm learning my lesson, asking my questions
Who am I impressing? Huh? And did I leave an impression?
Do they know I'm dope? I'm tryna leaving them guessing
Got em requesting my song about texting
And I had to listen to advise given
To me from my best friend telling me to never been
And keep it real
He don't even think I need a deal
It restricts me, it's a gift and a curse
Cause getting paid's lovely but criticism hurts
Fucking going reverse, things would probably change
Wouldn't be winging it, I would be properly trained
But now crash course did me well
Now I'm ready to do me, and re-bail
Got my eyes on heaven when I'm going through hell
And did a proper studying so how can we fail?

[Hook]
