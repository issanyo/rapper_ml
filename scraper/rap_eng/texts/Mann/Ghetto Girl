[Intro: Mann]
Ayo J.R., this your boy Mann
And let me tell you a story about me and this girl from my hood
Back in the day, Sean Kingston, sing it

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
She's my ghetto girl (ghetto girl)
She's been living in a ghetto world (ghetto world)
I bet she never met a guy like me (guy like me)
I wanna take her on a shopping spree (shopping spree)
'Cause she's my queen (yup)

[Verse 1: Mann]
Our story starts in the heart of the city
We used to play hide-and-seek at the park, come and get me
(Come with me) You got me, you kissed me, it would get me so happy
You were known for having Laffy Taffy, we called you candy (candy)
You had braids like Brandy, which my momma would braid
Then we'd go in the house and drink your grandmama's Kool-Aid
Remember school days when we caught the bus there
And I thought I was ballin' because I payed your bus fare
On the way home I'd protect you from danger
Make sure you wasn't kidnapped or harassed by some strangers
Then I promised you if I made it out the hood
You would be good, living life like you should

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
She's my ghetto girl (ghetto girl)
She's been living in a ghetto world (ghetto world)
I bet she never met a guy like me (guy like me)
I wanna take her on a shopping spree (shopping spree)
'Cause she's my queen (yup)

[Verse 2: Mann]
Now look what happened, Mann is rapping and stacking his dough
That boy get it popping, jerking and cracking fo' sho'
But don't trip, that promise I haven't forgot (uh uh)
As soon as I get time I'ma go back to my block (do what)
And see my candy girl (yes yes) My candy girl
Candy girl you are the sweetest thing in a man's world
My ghetto queen, I'ma drape you in jewels and bling (bling)
Spend all my green on everything to fulfil your dreams (fo' sho')
She said, "No Mann, baby, all I want is you
And being materialistic just ain't what I do"
I said "Whatchu expect? I'm now a signed artist" (fo' sho')
She said, "That don't matter I'ma love you regardless"

[Bridge: Sean Kingston]
She's got me hooked
And she's looking so fly—y—y (so fly)
And when she shakes it
She makes me lose my mi—i—ind
I just can't get enough
All because I'm in love with

[Chorus (Extended): Sean Kingston]
My ghetto girl (ghetto girl)
She's been living in a ghetto world (ghetto world)
I bet she never met a guy like me (guy like me)
I wanna take her on a shopping spree (shopping spree)
'Cause she's my queen (yup)
She's my ghetto girl (ghetto girl)
She's been living in a ghetto world (ghetto world)
I bet she never met a guy like me (guy like me)
I wanna take her on a shopping spree (shopping spree)
'Cause she's my queen (yup)
