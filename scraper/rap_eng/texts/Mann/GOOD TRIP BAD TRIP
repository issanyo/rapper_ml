[Intro]
Good or bad
Highs and lows
Right or wrong
I dont know, i just do
But feel good, because it feel good

[Verse1: Mann]
Been misguided a lot
We get high to touch god
I can't tell you whats right
Im just living my life

We all wanna feel love
We all wanna be in love
Somehow its planted in us
We feel it since birth
Some dont get enough thats when you get hurt
Living and search, wanna see how it works
Some find it in people, some find it in church
Im not a church person, but catch me at the service
I appreciate the energy, and i respect the word
But im a free spirit, advocate of herb
Peacelife Preacher, Passion in the verse
You ask me if its the Earth we should worship
Really fuck it up, being on some burn shit
Im from LA, im preparing for an earthquake
Working on being safe, fuck copping a new mercedes
PeaceLife President, you can be my first lady
Come free your mind, i know your spirit [?]

[Verse2: Mann]
Time really don't exist
We really slaves in a broken system
The way you deal with it is your own desition
You can find me in the smoking section, giving a story about my acid trip
How my life changed dramatically after it
Hang on that regular rapper shit
Nigguh feeling spiritual and shit

They saying do LSD, I'm just saying that's what happened in the 70's
They were on to something, something telling me
Life is a masterpiece, all we have to do is master peace
I practice peace, never stop, stay learning
Keep your mind open, I keep the J burning
