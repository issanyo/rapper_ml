Man, I feel like money
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey
'Cause I'm fly like a bee

Man, I got 'em all buzzin', buzzin', buzzin', buzzin'
Like da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Man, I got the world buzzin', buzzin', buzzin', buzzin'
Like da, da, da, da, da, da, da

Uh, back up to back up in the mix like that
And I know ya like it when it's just like that
All the girlies just love my swag
From my kicks to the way I fix my hat

I'm, back, fresh like some new J's
Brodie got next NBA to pay, I'm too paid
Shaded with some ladies
Reppin' my city, West L.A., baby

West L.A. made me this way
Two rule, stay fresh, homie get paid
Hey, never broke and never bummy
I'm from where it's forever sunny

Man, I feel like money
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey
'Cause I'm fly like a bee

Man, I got 'em all buzzin', buzzin', buzzin', buzzin'
Like da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Man, I got the world buzzin', buzzin', buzzin', buzzin'
Like da, da, da, da, da, da, da

When I come around, 'round, 'round
They go
Yeah, yeah, it's going down, down, down
They go

New cat with a old school feel
Only new artist with a old school deal
Tied the game by Steve Lobell
So we always win, don't receive no help

New girls act like they know me so well
But I shows no love and be like, oh, well
When my album drops, sure as hell gon' sell
Stack cash and laugh like LOL

Man, I feel like money
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey
'Cause I'm fly like a bee

Man, I got 'em all buzzin', buzzin', buzzin', buzzin'
Like da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Man, I got the world buzzin', buzzin', buzzin', buzzin'
Like da, da, da, da, da, da, da

When I come around, 'round, 'round
They go
Yeah, when I come around, 'round, 'round
They go

When I step in yo town, town, town
They go
Yeah, yeah, it's going down, down, down
They go

Yeah, yeah, shawty in my ear
Saying all the things that I wanna hear
Buzzin'

And as the night ends
I'ma have her and get all her friends
Buzzin'

Okay, hands in the air, yeah
From the back to the front, everywhere
Buzzin'

Throwin' out 20's
Throwin' out hundreds
Ladies gotta love it

Man, I feel like money
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey
'Cause I'm fly like a bee

Man, I got 'em all buzzin', buzzin', buzzin', buzzin'
Like da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Man, I got the world buzzin', buzzin', buzzin', buzzin'
