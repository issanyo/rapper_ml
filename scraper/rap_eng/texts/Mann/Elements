[Verse 1: Mann]

Girl I'm in my element
I think its about to settle in
Your friend fine but you look better than
Plus, I heard she nosey like an elephant
Aye listen up we ain't scared of them
These niggas know what I represent
She said she like old presidents
We did the vice no presidents
We did the crime no evidence
The devil like dope peddling
I know better but I show better
Of those medicines don't tell em
Im trying to get on your level
Turn up like a broke lever

[Hook: Mann]

The fire be burning, cuhz we smoking dope
The Earth keep turning, cuhz we on a roll
The Wind be blowing, as long as Im breathing
The Water be cleaning, and Lord Knows I need it

[Verse 2: Kevo Da Kid]

Lord knows I need it
The more we keep smoking its like the more we keep thinking
We roll to perfection your blunts be holy like jesus
We trying to keep it in motion
A tribe dont do this much chiefing my nigga please
Ignite that fire keep it burning (Roll up roll up)
Smoking tree of life we call it learning (Smoke up smoke up)
Im seeing sounds and hearing colors (Damn)
Shit I feel like Stevey Wonder
Boy Im speaking no evil, seeing no evil
A toast to me and mine not Wine thats nigga breaking bread with your people
My presence to this shits a present gift wrap its heaven sent
Burning rolling and blowing, I'm captain planet to elements

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mann]

Got me high up in heaven
Had to spark it with fire inhale it
Give you the real the fake shit not what Im buying or selling
Say what they hear don't think for thyself they kind of like parrots
Not thoughts of they own, they grown at home still live with they parents
Young nigga living that life so this is the time that I cherish
Every moment important you know I be high like a jet is
If niggas be hating on me, that must mean they jealous
Don't listen to what they be trying to tell us, nah
I be on my cloud above that
With my loud and a blunt wrap
Trying to bring the love back, bitch wussup
You could get lost or you could get with us
Young Hippy nigga twisting up

[Hook]
