Hit me a text
Let me know ya home alone
Get freaky with the camera phone
Hit you with a text
Got me on your favorite ringtone
Lately that's your favorite song
Hit me with a... Text
It could go down
Hit me need I be around
Hit you with a... Text
On the low nobody would have to know
Just hit me with a text

[Verse 1 - Mann]
Ah, she hit me up in the morninq
She be texting when she strethin' need yawnin
She be like good morning, I be like good morning
While I'm making cereal, the milk I be pouring
And I'm eating breakfast

She be tryna tease me need my dude it be working
When we working the text message be tarpin... Yeaa
That's why I love my female
She send me naked pics right to my e-mail
