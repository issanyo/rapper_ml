[Verse1: Roe Bunie]

They Calling Me again
Because I'm with my friends
Every days the weekend
That's just how we do
When I'm with my crew you can't tell us nothing
I'm feeling it again
Think its in my gin
Poor another cup up
I'm high in this motherfucker
And I'm in this motherfucker

And every time you in my mind
I feel like I can fly
Every time you in my mind
I am above

I think I'm in love
Love, love again
I think I'm in love
Love, love again
I think I'm in love

[Hook]
I wish I could be there
To see you everyday I don't have to call you
I wish I could be there
To see you everyday
I don't have to call you

[Verse2: Mann]

I ain't afraid of Nothing
Living life on the edge I get faded constant
I'm not the same following stars youngin chasing comets
The moon and sun for mankind I'm praying on it
It's funny how getting high gets me closer to it
The herb is of the earth so we're supposed to use it
For any doubts I hope that all my recent vocals prove that
I'm more committed to this shit than most that do it
Removed my self from the shelf to fucking host a movement
Fore saw the future in a trip don't trip I know conclusion
Don't believe in what they selling, please it's just illusion
In the end we gone win we can't come close to losing
Shout out to every web site that post my music
For the fans who know I want to change the world and hope I do it
Them haters hate meanwhile, they hoes is choosing
I just shade up in the cut rolling doobies
Pothead

[Verse3: Roe Bunnie]

They Calling Me again
Because I'm with my friends
Every days the weekend
That's just how we do
When I'm with my crew you can't tell us nothing
I'm feeling it again
Think its in my gin
Poor another cup up
I'm high in this motherfucker
And I'm in this motherfucker

And every time you in my mind
I feel like I can fly
Every time you in my mind
I am above

I think I'm in love
Love, love again
I think I'm in love
Love, love again
I think I'm in love
