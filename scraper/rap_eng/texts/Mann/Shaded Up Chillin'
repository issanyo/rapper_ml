[Verse 1]
Uh, shaded, and elevated
A big told yourself to those who said I'd never make it
Ain't it something? Started with nothing made it something
Still remain the project of the hood that I grew up in
I shine a little light on the West
Stop hating, you don't want no problem with us
Girls be flocking, and jocking while we up in the function
My girl got a girlfriend: double or nothing
Uh, they call me Mann from the Westside
Everybody wants me like the next life
When I'm here I know you catch the vibe
Cause I'm fresh to death, and I'm extra fly

[Hook]
They wanna roll with us cause they see we winnin'-we-we winnin'-winnin'
And it's a birthday party whenever we in the building-the-the building
We keep it going 'till the sun come up
And if you don't smoke have a drink in your cup
Cause yup, we just shaded up chillin', shaded up chillin', shaded up chillin'
Yup-yup, we just shaded up chillin', shaded up chillin', shaded up chillin'

[Verse 2]
Tell your man "stop cuffing", that lame is comedy
You should join my gang cause I'm who he wanna be
You see me shaded up with all this money in front of me
And I keep nothing but the baddest ladies as company
That's just the way we roll, that's the way we roll
We can kick it tonight, but you can't babe me though
It's a one-time thing, please don't get attached
You were just a victim, my swag on full attack
Yeah, ta-dow, how ya like me now?
Fellas love my flow, ladies love my style
Haters watch ya mouth, please don't come foul
Thirty-thousand on my dick every time I smile, bloaw

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Shaded up chillin', grade A+ women
Drink all spillin' on my shoes, I ain't trippin'
Drink all spillin' on my shoes, I ain't trippin'
Drink all spillin' on my shoes, I ain't trippin'
Shaded up chillin', grade A+ women
Drink all spillin' on my shoes, I ain't trippin'
Drink all spillin' on my shoes, I ain't trippin'
Drink all spillin' on my shoes, I ain't trippin'

[Hook]
