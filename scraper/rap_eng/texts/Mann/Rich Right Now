[Intro: Mann]
Money make the world go
Round and round
Round and round
Money make your girl go, down, down
Down, down

[Verse 1: Troi Breeze]
Ok I'm back in this bitch wit' my nigga Deedot and I'm snatchin' ya' chicks, attention
But no I don't pay her now mind, if she cheatin' on you why would I make her mine?
Niggas should probably be doin' the same
Then maybe you could come through in the range
Wit' the top missin' I blew out the brains
This is how it go when you gettin' change
And it add up to dollars cause you didn't change
Niggas is fake we in 2 different lanes
Look at my chest, it's a few different chains
Get money nigga don't do it for fame (don't do it for fame)
Daddy I just wanna ball
Yesterday I quit my job
That's why I'm takin' these shots
That's why I'm makin' 'em all
That's why I pray to the Lord

[Hook: Troi Breeze]
I can't wait to be rich
I can't wait to be rich
I can't wait to be rich, I can't wait to be rich, I can't wait to be rich
(Repeat)

[Bridge: Troi Breeze & Mann]
Money make the world go (Cash rules everything around me nigga; C.R.E.A.M)
Round and round
(What's real life when you wake up living out dreams?)
Round and round
Money make your girl go (C.R.E.A.M), down, down
Down, down
(Dreams)

[Verse 2: Troi Breeze]
Yeah, niggas wanna keep me in a box but I'm claustrophobic, ugh
And I like yo' thighs how I like my options: open, yeah
I'm on Fairfax rollin' up, muthafuck cops I'm blowin'
Yup, and you know I got an ounce of the bounce in the Honda
Lighting up a J, bout as round as E. Honda
Hand to the face; you ain't down wit' the ganja
I been thinkin' 'bout gettin' commas
Ever since, I was runnin' 'round in pajamas
Honest
You a novice wit' the profit
I'm a profit wit' the logic
Every thought is, a deposit
Niggas wish they, would've thought this
Got it locked bitch, I'm a locksmith
Open up

[Hook: Mann]
I can't wait to be rich
I can't wait to be rich
I can't wait to be rich, I can't wait to be rich, I can't wait to be rich
(Repeat)

[Bridge: Troi Breeze & Mann]

[Verse 3: Mann]
Look
My pack is the fattest
My bitches the baddest
My life above average
I came from the madness, switch it up
Nigga did magic, I should write a pamphlet
See what I established: we got the advantage
We causing the static don't panic
Lifestyle what we offer the planet, you want it you can have it
Word to mother, that's what I tell my brothas
Heaven's here; it's nowhere above ya'
Hell the same, so don't take me under
Worst behavior; they'll never love us
So fuck this shit bruh, help each other
Join together against these muthafuckas who helped start all this hatred
Pull a 187 on some gangsta shit

[Hook: Troi Breeze & Mann]
I can't wait to be rich
I can't wait to be rich
I can't wait to be rich, I can't wait to be rich, I can't wait to be rich
(Repeat)
