[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Soon as she laid her eyes on me, she forgot about you
Let's be for real, what you expect her to do?
Don't be mad, but she prolly off you
In no time she gone beg for me to come through

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
I ain't the one to play, no not at all
With the way that you be treating her, it's all your fault
Damn, dawg, it's a shame that I'm the one she call
I really didn't wanna have to get involved
But look at me, then look at you
Then look at me, then look at you
Then look at me, then look at you
Then look at me
Then look at me, then look at you
Then look at me, then look at you
Then look at me, then look at you
Then look at me, then look at you

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
They say life is a little unfair
So you might wanna get your girl
She a fan of me
Yeah, she a fan of me, she a fan of me
I ain't never going nowhere
So you might wanna get your girl
She a fan of me
Yeah, she a fan of me, she a fan of me

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
I be walking that walk
So you better believe I'ma talk that talk
If I make that move, she'll be gone gone gone
Thinking you gon' get her back, nigga, whomp whomp whomp

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
I ain't the one to play, no not at all
With the way that you be treating her, it's all your fault
Damn, dawg, it's a shame that I'm the one she call
I really didn't wanna have to get involved
But look at me, then look at you
Then look at me, then look at you
Then look at me, then look at you
Then look at me
Then look at me, then look at you
Then look at me, then look at you
Then look at me, then look at you
Then look at me, then look at you

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
They say life is a little unfair
So you might wanna get your girl
She a fan of me
Yeah, she a fan of me, she a fan of me
I ain't never going nowhere
So you might wanna get your girl
She a fan of me
Yeah, she a fan of me, she a fan of me

[Verse 3: Mann]
Ay, look brah I'm the overall better guy
You somethin' like a penguin, you ain't never fly
Your girlfriend had to upgrade
You old news and even then, you never made the front page
I'm paid, laid back, I never try too hard
I'm a pimp, never was a simp like you are
You are just not the guy for the job
The position opened up, wonder why I took the spot

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
But look at me, then look at you
Then look at me, then look at you
Then look at me, then look at you
Then look at me
Then look at me, then look at you
Then look at me, then look at you
Then look at me, then look at you
Then look at me, then look at you

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
They say life is a little unfair
So you might wanna get your girl
She a fan of me
Yeah, she a fan of me, she a fan of me
I ain't never going nowhere
So you might wanna get your girl
She a fan of me
Yeah, she a fan of me, she a fan of me
