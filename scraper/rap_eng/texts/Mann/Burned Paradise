(Verse 1)
Mary Mary quite contrary
How does your garden grow?
With sliver bells and cockel shells
and pretty maids all in a row
Be careful what you wish for
as it may come and grow

(Pre Verse)
Come with me little one!
I'll bring you to the circus!
The popping corn and the candies!
You will never be with your mommy and daddy

(Chorus)
Peek a boo! I can clearly see you!
Frightful eyes are shining like the blue night
Are you ready to give in within my grasp
Take you all and all will bow down.

Burn Ha ha ha!
Burn Ha ha ha!
Burn Ha ha ha!
My Burned Paradise!

(Verse 2)
Hold me, hold me! Don't you worry
I'll catch you when you fall
Into the pits of all the is
Of the sewage fall
Of all the things you wanna do
Don't make me bawl

(Pre Verse)
Go run and hide little one
You'll miss your tea party!
You'll will never see anything
You will never be with you mommy and daddy

(Chorus)
Peek a boo! I can clearly see you!
Frightful eyes are shining like the blue night
Are you ready to give in within my grasp
Take you all and all will bow down.

Burn Ha ha ha!
Burn Ha ha ha!
Burn Ha ha ha!
My Burned Paradise!

(Bridge)
No one will remember you anymore!
Thrive your little life and live long
No time to spare or you'll be mine!
The burnt orange explosions!
The hell mixed with endless fun
While you burn within the lights that'll drive you insane!

(Chorus)
Peek a boo! I can clearly see you!
Frightful eyes are shining like the blue night
Are you ready to give in within my grasp
Take you all and all will bow down.

Burn Ha ha ha!
Burn Ha ha ha!
Burn Ha ha ha!
My Burned Paradise!
