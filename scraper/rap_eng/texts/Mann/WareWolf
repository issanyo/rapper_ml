[Intro talking: Mann]

Smoking this kush got me feeling like

Mann

It got me, it got me

[Verse1: Mann]

Feeling like I just might be the truest
Motherfucker out here to do music
I've been thru it all
Traveled the word I've been to it all
Young nigga my demeanor might of threw them off
Was getting in clubs with a Fake I.D
And I dare the security guard to come and try to take my weed
Threw up the peace sign to every face I see
Hoes choosing because they see I'm P A I D
Mostly active in the late night
After hours in the lab bout to take flight
Coconuts Ciroc shots, what it taste like
Smoking pot and won't stop til the day light
Got me feeling like a Vampire Ware Wolf scary story told by the campfire
Gold on my herringbone west coast inspired
Only true question is who can get Mann higher

[Hook: Mann]

Turn me up never turn me down
Ain't know me then, bet they know me now
Spark the blunt watch it go around
You got that loud lift me off the ground
Smoke me out baby smoke me out
Smoke me out can you smoke me out
I'm in your town you better hold me down
We got enough Kush to go around

[Verse2: Mann]

She love it when I tell her roll up
(Aye baby I got this tree and I got this swisher can you roll that up for me real quick)
Hot box the whip roll the window up
Dro I got so much smoke slow we in no rush
Puff puff ash puff puff puff pass
Roll it good make the blunt last for Yump Daniels
Just as you should fucking with one above average
As far as ladies you know I'm dealing with a bad one
Standards high never let them lower
Smoking loud Kush got an odor
Mom know I'mma stoner
Rare moment if you caught him sober
I'm be high exploring the system solar
See shit in a different order
Different boy in a distant world
Lost in drugs substances and girls
Seen the future just waiting for it to transpire
The only true question is who can get Mann higher

[Hook]

[Outro talking]

Smoking this kush got me feeling like
Yump, Lisa
It Got me It got me
