[Blessed]
They say live everyday to the fullest
Well it’s hard when everyday I walk the block I’m dodging bullets
Bullets from the media, and bullets from the people
I'mma spit truth filled bullets until they’ll give us our equal
My words are my weapons and I'mma shoot em like they’re lethal
So here’s the injection
We scream life’s a bitch and take her down with no protection
We run trains on our hope that she might birth life trough this recession
But hip-hop ain’t dead, life is, it just needs a resurrection
But see I’m fighting to live, and you just living to fight
You’re pimping the night, you gotta walk on behind
You’re calling it a shadow like you’re scared of the light
And that ain’t right, cause that’s not how you were thought
But when the TV is your moms, and the block is your paps
And you caught rocks as hard as stop getting that chance
But you want the money and the fame
Guns and something to blaze
So funny how you change
And so you take it to the night like you running from the days
And so we stuck in the days with our eyes to the sun
Your near life experience has just begun

[Mann (Talking)]
West side
Yeah
Thanks for uhm, downloading my mixtape
A Near Life Experience
And I know y’all wondering: why is it called a near life experience?
Yo, swag, ah, well

[Mann]
Before the concept let me introduce myself
The young bombshell I'm sure you’ll respond well
Dijon hell
Why not state my club?
It's the name my mama gave me, plus it’s the name I love
But call me M A dubb, a.k.a. mister so fly
Fitted in Europa
Mann is what I go by
I bet you wanna know why
I guess that’s cause you know Z
In order for you to know I
You must have to know me
Me being the one MCing
The mack on the scene
With a lean looking clean
With a queen from my left to a right is a king
To rub my head I don’t need a guillotine
But Mann get it jumping like a trampoline
But battle everything
I’m the one the envy
Started at 14, good at 15, signed at 16, living every kids’ dream
And the dream you had, oh, well, and to bad
L O L, U mad?
You better bail through that
Pockets lookin' too fat
Call me the new Jack
Rappers, Don't get it mixed like a two-track
And actors, we in with the new catch
Uh, let me introduce you to Zazz
Old price new cash
It's like strobe lights when the camera flash
Well Mann a pass, menopause, in the period
I kill the cat for the women if you curious
Uh, because fly is what I clearly is
This man is illi, I'm realli, I kill the silly kids
Now you know the basics of the flow
So strap in tight and be sure to enjoy the show
As I take you, the people through the journey
Have a playa live: equals love, sex, and money
But all of it is real, never less than a hunnid
This's for real music fans, guarantee you're gonna love it
I put that on my budget, I put that on my unborns
Mann fresher than some clothes that are unworn
LA babies, ladies adore me
Me being tight is like saying the sun's warm
The understatement of the year
Put my self in landing here
No worries Mann is here
