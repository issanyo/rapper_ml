No Violations
Only good vibrations
I'm the voice of my nation
Young Niggas gone ride out tonight
Thank ya'll for yall patience
Sorry to keep y'all waiting
I was doing my thang living
One amazing wonderful life
Man fuck yo advice
We young and don't live twice
So I'm doing what feels good
I give a fuck if its right
When she left yo hood
We met up at midnight
She said you were no good
She let me get in it twice
I really live a different life
Moving fast trying to get it right
I had to say it One Time
What that west la city like? (West)
Girl you know exactly what to do to get me right
Have the weed rolled, bend over then touch your toes

[Hook: Mann]

Turn off all the lights
Open up your eyes
We about to catch a Vibe

Im trying to get faded
Eyes low like Asians

Keep it persistent, I'm strictly on my mission
But still YB on my hit list, watch wifey keep her distant
Before she missing, yeah

Man I been dipping, whipping it while I'm Sipping
Slipping and sliding gripping, living this life im living
Its twisted so I ain't tripping
