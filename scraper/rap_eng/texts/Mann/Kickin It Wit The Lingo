Ki-kickin it wit the lingo
Crispy like a Pringle
Ki-kickin it wit the lingo
Crispy like a pringle
Ki-kickin it wit the lingo
Crispy like a pringle
Ki-kickin it wit the lingo
Crispy like a pringle
Ki-kickin it wit the lingo
Crispy like a pringle
Ki-kickin it wit the lingo
Crispy like a pringle
Ki-kickin it wit the lingo
Crispy like a pringle
Ki-kickin it wit the lingo
Crispy like a pringle

[Verse 1: Mann]
Black shades, fresh kicks, and a curly top
If you a top model, you type of girl he bop
In Hip-Hop with the swag boy, sure he'll rock
I'm tryna be known as the man when my story stops
But it ain't finna end soon, let that nigga grow
Khaled said I'm the West Coast jigalo
And you know I took it straight to the head
Got cocky, like girl we going straight to the bed
No talking, no date, no need to conversate
I know you got a donk and h√©, I wish you head a bombin' face
But I ain't trippin', girl, I try to get it in
I know she is wit it by the lingo I be kickin
I'm bringing the auto mackin' back into rap
I'mma be the biggest, no opinions, immerse facts
Been doin' this since a nigga sippin' on simalacs
Now I'm closer than a ratio from skin to fat

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Rubber grib, broady niggas know I'm with the rib
Shoes tied tight, bitch I never could trip
Birds boutta fly, nigga ready for the flip
Three pieces on the Chevy, with them swole up lips
Big money bitch, wouldn't have it any other way
Two keys on the girl, it's a double date
5's go for 10, bitch I'm goin' in
If Mann want to beat kill, tell a nigga in
I'm getting famous and it's all of the mixtape
I rip shit, why you waiting on your big brakes?
I fuck a bitch, and have em begging for a dick brake
Them last smokers, send them back til your shit fades
X-turn boping, he know how this young do
I walk upon a pussy nigga with the gun drawn
You know what it is when we come trough
Bowl up shit, and throw money out the sunroof

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shawn Chrystopher]
Sittin' in the coupe so high on some other shit
Having simple thoughts of this and rappers for the fuck of it
I had too much of it, never had luck with it
I wonder me a wife, but all I get is to fuck a bitch
If life's a bitch, then hell yeah fuck a bitch
Same 4-7, what I'mma do with a fucking sense?
I need photos, girls ask for photos
Because my dick'll keep em all up, no no-does
So I ain't goin' no fucking place
I air it out, you don't like it, then protect your face
Paid it forth, I'm ace
Quit my day-job, and left the game without a trace
Cause, no case, no sue, no lawyer, no proof
Tom sowyar in his booth, you see that axe?
Boy shoot the nice black, and I'mma stay here
Cause in this movie you'll die, when you say I'll be right back
