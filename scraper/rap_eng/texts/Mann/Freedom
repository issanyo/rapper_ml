[Hook]
How you feeling [?]
Home cloud 9, like baby don't let my high come down
You can have it all, it's your world, your girl
You don't need a home, enjoy your freedom

[Verse 1]
I thought I hold that, I want that
Hope you know I'm gonna catch, if you throw it back
Baby got her own swag, she own that
I'm just trynna get a songtrack
A girl that fine don't need to hold back
Cut the school [?] cause girl you're so fat
Fucking with the Daniels and you know that
I'll be high up where they hoes at
If I kill it I kill it like toe tag
And I don't brag but my sex game wild
Show you some things that'll make you say wow
Turn every girl [?] that I take down

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Take the clothes off girl, have your fun
You know we got drink, we can have more than one
Homies so bad see that ass from the front
Can't pass you up, pass up the blunt
Baby girl what you need, you can have what you want
That's something that your man never ask you (huh?)
Been living life fast they last few months
Nah I don't think it's bad, Nah it's not too much
Fuck the past (x2) I can be your future
Don't try to front girl, I can see right thru ya
You should let me do ya
Kamasutra girl
I'm the new drug

[Hook]

Ohhhhhh
Enjoy your freedom
Freedom, freedom, freedom

[Hook]
