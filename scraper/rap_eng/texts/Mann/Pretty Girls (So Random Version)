[Pre-Hook: Iyaz]
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this town
I'm trying to pick the right one
I'm trying to pick the right one
Trying to find a shorty to hold me down

[Verse 1: Iyaz]
They say to get the New York girl Then you gotta have a lot of class
And I heard there ain't nothing like the Cali girls But you better have a lot of cash
And I know there ain't nothing like the A-Town girl
Cuz they know how to show you love
And no matter where I go I gotta let them know
That this song here is about you
See I don't mean to run away
To places you would not believe
It's dealing on these pretty gals
I'm wishing you were there with me
It's simple when you smile girl
Trust me all I need to know
You can be my one and only

[Hook: Iyaz]
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
I'm trying to pick the right one
I'm trying to pick the right one
I'm trying to pick the right one
I'm trying to pick the right one
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this town
I'm trying to pick the right one
I'm trying to pick the right one
Trying to find a shorty to hold me down
Tell me is it you, girl?
Is it you, girl? [x4]

[Verse 2: Mann]
I'm so indecisive
Trying to find a pretty girl that these shoes goes nice with
Been around the world and back
Got a nack for them girls in black
But I need a chick
That's gonna hold me tight like vice grips
Just make sure you leave my heart how you found it
You can keep the key but the lock stays around it
Baby, let's take it slow, no pulling a fast one
And you look like the type to keep my mind off the last one
