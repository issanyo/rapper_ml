[Hook: Oktane]
Is too many woodies on the wall
Baby why you're not dancing
Got you in there thinking you're fancy
I like my girls nasty
You ain't with it don't ask me
So tell em girls to stop that askin'
We don't want models I need me a ratchet
We don't want models I need me a ratchet
We don't want models I need me a ratchet

[Verse 1 : Oktane]
I say I say
This one for them ratchets
They come and sweat they weave out
Yeah it's like that throw it back now I leave out
I love ratchets... and it's a lot in here
If she ain't shaking plain and simple get her out of here
I guess her daddy girl quit it Price took it nigga
I know that you ain't hit the club just to look at niggas
You paid to get in so drinking with me free
And if you don't shake it for anybody it should be me
So ah what's going down
Drop it like it's heaven Lord Jesus Lord Little Caesar's baby
Keep it hot and ready
The bakers in here shaking me stuck up woodies say to me
Money yeah I'm making it so baby make it shake a bit

But I came with my girl I'm slipin
She caught me dancing with a ratchet
Now she trip nails nails did nice weave no braids
Turnt up she ain't turnin down no fakes, and I ain't either
