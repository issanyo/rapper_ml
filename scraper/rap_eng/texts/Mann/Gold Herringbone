Gold herringbone (gold herringbone)
Uh, this is the first thing I bought with my check, yeah

Yeah (yeah), Yump (yump), Yeah (yeah), West (west), Yeah (yeah), Yump (yump), Yeah (yeah)

Dijon Shariff Thames is the name my momma gave me
You'll see the side now, born Englewood baby
A lotta y'all wouldn't be here to the game the same time
DJ Quick Drop Quick is the name
The year was 91 I don't remember much then
But I was always with my auntie and my little cousin
See my auntie was a blood
My uncle was in jail
My daddy wasn't there
When my momma did hair
So I spent most of my hours with her
And would listen to that G shit when I was rehears
Sugar Free, Quik, Snoop, 40, Short, Dre, Pop
(West coast legends I had to be one) Straight drop

You notice this man, the West LA rap
Birthday gang, you should join my set
Not a blood or a crip
Just cockin' my grip
And I put that on the gold herringbone on my neck
1,2,3,4 reppin' for fly niggas we all across the globe
Not a blood or a crip
Just cockin' my grip
And I put that on the gold herringbone on my neck
1,2,3,4 Welcome to Mann's World
Leave them suckers at the door
Not a blood or a crip
Just cockin' my grip
And I put that on the gold herringbone on my neck

Yeah (yeah), Yump (yump), Yeah (yeah), West (west), Yeah (yeah), Yump (uh), Yeah (yeah)

Pick up the pen at 14
Created real magic no mirrors or smoke screens
I was too little to play on those teams
There was a big difference from me and most teens
Into adult things and I started becoming infatuated with money, women, and clothing
They said Mann you'll never make it not in yo dreams (what?)
Now I'm on and they stuffin' LA with no cheese
Shy lil pro see here to give you what you need
I'm here for the long term
You're stuck with me
Oh no I ain't leavin' no time soon
Man I just moved, new home is your iTunes

1,2,3,4 Welcome to Mann's World
Leave them suckers at the door

Yeah (yeah), Yump (yump), Yeah (yeah), West (west), Yeah (yeah), Yump (yump), Yeah (yeah)

Very young boy, who grew up in the urban community
Shit, a gold chain meant the world to us man
When I got my check, first thing I bought
Was this gold herringbone around my neck

Mann's World, West LA (West LA, West LA)
Birthday gang, West LA, Yeah
