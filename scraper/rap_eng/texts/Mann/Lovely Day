[Verse 1: Mann]
I, woke up and rolled up out the bed feeling like a king
My reality rare, I'm living like a dream
The world is unaware of the type of change I could bring to it
Who you know went through my struggle and this type of pain
It's only trouble after I bubble on top of things
I'm not the type of rapper who chase after guap and chains
Bro I do it 'cause I know my swag can stop a train
Just a young, wild nigga, Waka Flocka Flame
Follow me, as I ever so properly
Begin to break down this whole birthday philosophy
Honestly if you not part of the movement
I do not need you to figure have to offer me two cents
Man who's this? I surprise my damn self
My mom showed 'em she did it without a man's help
So God bless us with a present like everyday
So in her case e'ry day is her birthday
Get it? That's the message I deliver
Chasing dreams, tryna make figures as big as Jigga's
And you can hide the brick nigga, put the guns away
Follow me and it'll probably be

[Chorus: Frank Ocean (as Lonny Breaux)]
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay, a lovely day

[Verse 2: Mann]
Look, I'm not just your average Joe
And this is not just your average flow
This is something magical
Cali home-grown, extra potent homie, that's fo' sho'
And if you didn't now you know
This is everything I practiced for
Showtime, 'bout to make an impact in yo' life
The young graduate of '09
I'm more than just swag and dope rhymes
Or walking fashion show lines
My aura of [?] is gone shine
Like the sun during the day time
Yeah they was hot during they time, it's our turn
Do you not see me? I'm a star sir
Fresh off the plane looking for car service
I just landed in my dreams and I'm 'bout to go sightseeing

[Chorus: Frank Ocean (as Lonny Breaux)]
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay, a lovely day

[Verse 3: Mann]
BDB established at the Grand Lux
Tryna find a perfect name to brand us
Had to identify the type of name I wanna push
And then the birthday mojo came through in the clutch
BDB, I was like, "it stand for what?"
Birthday Boys bro, in the cake we trust
Everyday our B-day, everyday we fresh
And everyday we celebrate, celebrate with us
That's why your girl leave you to come hang with us
What y'all be trippin' off [?], ain't a thang to us
Livin' life, everything is plush
And when she were here mayne, it ain't a rush
When she roll with a B-day boy, feeling dangerous
And the kush grade A+
Behind my back they hate us
But in my face they hush, they sus'
Sleepin' on Mann, nigga, wake up

[Chorus: Frank Ocean (as Lonny Breaux)]
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay, a lovely day
A lovely day
A lovely day
