[Intro]
It's mine
Get on the bus now

[Verse 1]
She said that I was different
She started asking bout my upbringing
What's my religion?
I'm not a Muslim, I'm not a Buddist, I'm not a Christian or Jewish
I'm bout living in abundance in a world without division
Fuck a politician
And we on already
Without a father, who lied on a plate, a lot of patience
Sometimes you doing everything should be straight in moderation
And that being creative, gods givin obligation
And the sky's amazing, the sky's amazing

[Hook]
The world is too many lights
You can't enjoy the darkness at night
Gazing at the stars in the sky
Wondering why my horoscope's always right
It's the philosophy of zodiac signs
Worlds of astrology must [?] every line
Trying to focus my mind
Travelling space through the absence of time
We are the stars in the sky
Travelling space, absence of time

[Verse 2]
Star in the sky, shining define, and define, find them hiding in their rhythms
Built a little lie, finally finding yourself
Nigguh I don't need your help
My words are magic, this gon be classic
I can tell that it's felt
By the masses, getting deep into my practice
Even tho my life on this planet seems to slow that process
I had to lower my conscience to enjoy the stuff of this world
Hella drugs and these girls, never get enough of the pearl
Even though it's tough, still show you some
You can hate it, be illuminated, we the chosen ones
Challenges we've overcome, I did it on my own
Now watch me make this hole in one, the vibe is on this fucking
Perfect for this time [?]
Love is radiating from me, this how I express it
I confess I know that shit can get wild and reckless
But we're blessed, peace life and I stand by that message
Yeah

[Hook]

[Outro]
Peace life quality
We are the stars in the sky
Just smoke, yeah
