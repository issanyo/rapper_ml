[Hook: Mann & Buddy]

Shawty dancing on stage
She keep dropping it low
Girl don't trip on my age
Ain't nobody gone know
Why dont you give me a chance
I bet that you'll have fun with us
Only real niggas run with us
Fuck your boyfriend, Come with us

Shake that ass for a young nigga
Shake that ass for a young nigga
Shake that ass for a young nigga
Shake that ass for a young nigga
(2x)

[Verse:1 Mann]

Shake that ass for a young nigga
She know I rap, So she gladly do that
Running through stacks and the matte is too black on the mark
And they be like how he do that
Its a wrap, and it cost me 2 stacks
But back to Miss lil Mama booty too fat
Bounce and Clap, can you make it do that
For me and my bro, how much cheese can I throw
Crossfaded off weed and Patron
Way too gone, I need to leave that alone
Still young, but I feel so grown
At the strip club I don't want go home
Just living my life to the Max
Ill pay for that dance whats the price and the tax?
I ain't tripping cuz I can do that
I ain't tripping cuz I can do that
West La you know we on the map
California back, Its a known fact
Me and Buddy, Yeah we go back
Like 4 flats on a cadilLac
So throw it back, throw throw it back
Baby girl I need more of that
Shake it where my homeboys at
Im ten toes down like a door mat uh

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Buddy}

Yeah buddy is a mack daddy
Tell by the tip of my thumbs that I pack fattys
And I pull up in a Black Caddy
Looking for a chick in the club thats lap happy
When I throw a couple dollars that'll make her happy
Rats know I got cheese so they try to trap me
LIke I'm Ghetto, but its better if they not nappy
Tacky, crappy, I ain't playing im just saying thats me
Caught me off guard when she showed me that cooder
So I got hard start throwing that Gouda
Grabbed me by the wrist put my hands on her booty
In a couple seconds shawty you will be using your macula
Ask me about my age and I handed her a ruler
Mann said baby girl ride like a scooter
Gave me a lap dance and I told her ass to scoot up
Before I went to work you know I had to suit up
Now I'm looking in my pants for an O, But Man I can't find any mo
And, damn I was really trying to slide through the goal
But now I gotta drive to store
And I Got 10 on the Tank, 5 on the dro
Still haven't ate, 9 for to go
Hi to the drank, bye to the ho
Because i'd rather get high with the bros
I told her shake that ass for a young nigga
Hopefully she'll consider
Im in love with your tight stomachs
I can tell you've done sit ups
In the trunk there's tons of stuff
And Buddy Boy ain't one to bluff
And Add to the fact my funds is up
And She runs with us and that sums it up and now
