[Intro: Big Time Rush]
Better with you
Better with you, yeah

[Verse 1: James]
I tried to write this down
The words just don’t come out
It’s hard to say how you feel
Been down the longest road
Said yes when I meant no
I lost control of the wheel

[Pre-Chorus : Logan & Carlos]
Cause you know that
Things get so bad
You’ve got my back
Make me wanna sing, and girl I’ll sing about ya
No sweeter sound than what I’ve found
No perfect love could be more perfect than us

[Chorus 2]
Ooooh baby
It feels like
It feels like
Music sounds better with you
Baby
It feels right
It feels right
Everything’s better with you

[Verse 2: Kendall]
I used to think that love
Was something fools made up
Cause all I knew was heartbreak
Oh, I couldn’t help myself
Let this heart go through hell
There’s only so much a heart can take

[Chorus 1]
Cause you know that
Things get so bad
You’ve got my back
Make me wanna sing, and girl I’ll sing about ya
No sweeter sound than what I’ve found
No perfect love could be more perfect than us

[Chorus 2]
Ooooh baby
It feels like
It feels like
Music sounds better with you
Baby
It feels right
It feels right
Everything’s better with you

[Verse 3: Carlos]
Every song
Every rhyme
Every word
Is better with you (Music sounds better with you)
Every day (every day)
All of the time (All of the time)
Every way
Music sound better with you

[Verse 4: Mann]
She’s my music enhancer
When the music plays she’s my dancer
When I’m around her everything’s faster
Every question I have she’s the answer
I’m head over heels
Can’t explain that this all so real
When I’m around you baby you make me feel like
Everything’s better with you

[Chorus 2]
Ooooh baby
It feels like
It feels like
Music sounds better with you
Baby
It feels right
It feels right
Everything’s better with you

[Verse 5]
It feels like
It feels like
Music sounds better with you
Baby
It feels right
It feels right
Everything’s better with you
The music sounds better with you
Music sounds better with you
