[Intro]
Our love is eternal
In your eyes I see my soul
You love the way I glow
Lets chase that rabbit.. (rabbit..)

[Verse1: Mann]
Uh..Lets hop on it
Young and live in the moment
Get on this rollercoaster and ride this bitch like its stolen
[?] She rollin', in my pockets a Trojan
We smoke and fuck then she floatin'
Off the motion, the ocean
We pop us a couple caps, then contemplate 'bout society
Thats all i ever ask
Someone to talk and get high with me ride with me, and provide for me
Lets go cop us a property
Drop out and live in privacy. Start a garden or forest
Give it up to the lord. Universe working for us
Lets explore it, no Dora
Love is whats most important
Oh how quickly [?]
I remember get in the booth recording
