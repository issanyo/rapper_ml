[Verse 1: Mann]
Unh, this feeling I can't explain for nothing
I would Exchange, I love it
To the public I probably just look insane but fuck it
It's not in vain it's something I love showing
Feels like I'm rolling, knowing that I'm glowing

[Bridge: Mann]
Feeling good, hands up high if you living good
I do what I want to cause I'm rebelling
And you could see me and the homies yelling, yelling

[Hook: Mann]
Yo, we hear it everywhere we go (everywhere we go)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
If you know you got it then let it show (then let it show)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
No matter how many times they tell us no
They can never stop the way we glow, glow, glow, glow

[Verse 2: Mann]
Yeah, there ain't much that I can't do
Everything I dreamt of eventually came true
Spiritually strong so nobody could break you
As long as I do me, I don't care what they do
And I stayed steady when it was unstable
And I came up when people thought I wasn't able
I showed 'em all, I showed 'em all
Shooting for the moon but the stars broke my fall, and all
I became a beast, baby I became an animal
They let me off the leash, now I'm coming after you
I represent the streets, in my city I'm the man to know
I'm the man to know oh, oh

[Hook: Mann & Shaleah Nicole]

[Bridge 2: Mann]
Gl-glowing, glowing
Feeling good, hands up high if you living good, gl-glowing
Feeling good, hands up high if you living good, gl-glowing
Gl-glowing

[Hook: Mann & Shaleah Nicole]
