[Chorus]
We in a race and I just passed you twice
It's like a game of monopoly it's easy
I'm way too nice
Like I'll set you up and pay for your funeral, that's nice

We in a race and I just passed you twice
It's like a game of monopoly it's easy
I'm way too nice
I'm way too nice

[Verse 1: HitTown]
I seen you at the club you was froze like statue
Treat you like a dog, whats in yo pockets we pat you
Nigga you was ghost like Knots & Horror Nights
I don't fuck with niggas like ku klux and dykes
You is a square nigga, you geek
Nigga you vegan how you want beef?
We shoot clips like Spike Lee
Then storm off set like Cardi B
You is not me, you is broke you a hoe and you is not G
Hopped on yo mobile then you sprint like you seen five of me
It was one of me nigga
I was gone ask for the time, not for yo phone lil bro
I need that drop top benz with two topless twins
That will ride till the end like that Jay Z song
I'ma ride til the very end, just me and my loks, just me and my loks

[Chorus: HitTown]
We in a race and I just passed you twice
It's like a game of Monopoly it's easy
I'm way too nice
Like I'll set you up and pay for your funeral, that's nice

We in a race and I just passed you twice
It's like a game of monopoly it's easy
I'm way too nice
I'm way too nice

[Verse 2: YeloHill]
Nigga you'll get socked like ManKind
The shit I got explode niggas, that's a man mine
You say you gangsta and official that's a bad lie
We had you sweating like Kobe Bryant half time
Little man, must of though he was Like Mike
Niggas chicken like a number 3 at Popeyes
Funny guy you remind me of Richard Pryor
Please don't bang on none of the homies, this the West Side
Niggas graduate and think they Tookie
You're a cookie, we play ball you're just a rookie
You gang bang what? this is not porn
You will get cooked quick like popcorn
Private school trust fund, fuckin' bum
You the nigga off of 8 Mile ?????
You the type of nigga that's always gone try and prove something
Hit the county jail and we knowing you not gone do nothing (nigga)

[Chorus: HitTown]
We in a race and I just passed you twice
It's like a game of Monopoly it's easy
I'm way too nice
Like I'll set you up and pay for your funeral, that's nice

We in a race and I just passed you twice
It's like a game of monopoly it's easy
I'm way too nice
I'm way too nice

[Verse 3: Mann]
I use to give a fuck now I don't
Nowadays I barely answer the phone
If it ain't bout the paper then what you want (nigga)
I'm way too nice (uhh)
I came through nice
I came through like I run this bitch
And I might take her if I want his bitch
So sorry it had to come to this
But I'm a fucking king
Henny what I sip this is not codeine
Get you knocked off If you not the team
It's not a thing, bada boom, baby bada bing
Mob shit nigga, you could not compete
You went on a mission you could not complete
Shaded like a California palm tree
I made it out I'm flying out the country
Smoking bomb weed, west west

[Chorus: HitTown]
We in a race and I just passed you twice
It's like a game of Monopoly it's easy
I'm way too nice
Like I'll set you up and pay for your funeral, that's nice

We in a race and I just passed you twice
It's like a game of monopoly it's easy
I'm way too nice
I'm way too nice
