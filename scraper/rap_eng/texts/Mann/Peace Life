[Verse 1: Mann]

Sitting still as the the world spins
This shit is real it gets revealed in the whirlwind
Sometimes I think I need a girlfriend
Nothing can take my mind off the problems like the pearl can
Ain't got none, but thinking about my children
Like will I conceal them from this fake world we live in
It's just a mental prison we changing our condition
Life is based off thought Its all about decisions
One day I had a vision the mission was clear
I'm the next to be like them great mean who ain't here
As long as I handle my business with wisdom and care
Give up to the divine spirit taking me there
Earth Fire water and Air ,the sun and the moon
What I seek and speak is the truth you will understand soon
Last summer tried shrooms , because it comes from the earth
That led to research, revelation ,rebirth, Word

[Verse 2: Mann]

What's Living Without a Motive
Like children Without a Future
Inspired a crowd I spoke to about my interest in possibly starting a Counter culture
A world without owls and vultures
Who hover over us and watch as they reduce us
To useless Humans, the fuck are they doing?
Its just a sound stage bruh this can't be true man
I got a voice and I'mma use it since I got the chance
I got to stand, for all my fans
For those who don't understand
Don't even trip , because he's got a plan
Though its not a man, I just gotta say it
A lot of meditation and a lot of prayer
Life is just a game, lucky I'mma player
Had to practice patience now baby I'm prepared

[Verse 3: Mann]

Everything I need right in front of me
Since kid I dictated how my life was gonna be
I would be big one day , because that's all I see
This art is apart of me fulfilling prophecy
My life is one big party scene All my women quality
Crack em all like pollyseeds, OYB the policy
Mother fuck the politics I mean that no apologies
I'm just tired of all the shit with intentions of stopping me
I'm released now I'm relieved
I am no longer in the system, which means I'm no body's property
Renegade artist setting himself up properly
Give me studio freedom of speech and a lot of weed
In the end there won't be a goal that I have not achieved
Surrender Trust And Receive
We all STARS, on the same team
Expressions of the universe, living in the same dream
