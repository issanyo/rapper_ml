[Verse 1: Auburn]
Rocking to the function with my fans all black
Tighten up the strap to ratchet's backpack
They tryna swagsurf, but I had to bring it back
Cause I learned about the stands, and I had it downpacked
First I bust a twist, then I dip real low
Do the reject and a pause on my toes
Girlies in the function with my curlies and the function
They surprised, I see them rolling their eyes when he blushed
J-E-R-K, is what you can call me errday
Is that Gabby? Where she at?
Is she jerking? What is that?
Had to break it down with my label chain and fitting cap

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mann]
West! Hey sis, let me kick it one time
O-K, K-O, knock 'em out: punchline
Who thought about the jerk? Who you thought? No other
Than a younger B-Dayboy, West LA, your brother
Been a DJ brother, hit 'em with the sneaky swag-swag
If you can't jerk, you're the people that we laugh at
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you're rejected like the running man
Nobody can jerk like M-A-double-N
J-E-R-K, is what you can call me errday
Is that Mann? Where he at?
Is he jerking? What is that?
I'm a track, jerk women, Cali-ba-ba-ba-back

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Auburn]
Go Beezy, do your thing girl, twerk
But if you step to me, better know how to jerk
Rocking skinny jeans, fresh cut, look clean
Got a steez real mean, that's my lil' boo thang
Ha, he said you a jerk
I told 'em that ... little thing never heard
Four T-shirt, best to leave, I'm a flirt
Port 'em to the dance flo' and made 'em hold my purse

[Hook]

[Outro]
J.R., you're are now officially a jerk
Because of this song
Tell the DJ: You can play my jerk song
