[Pre-hook: Mann]

Theres a lot of girls in the club
But you really caught my eye, Feeling like
I may of just fell in love for the very first time
I just want to slow dance with you
No one else but you , Girl
Meet me on the Dance floor
And don't be afraid Babe

[Hook: Mann]

We gone dance the night away, Hey
We gone dance the night away, Hey
So Baby tell me what you say, Hey
We gone dance the night away, Hey

[Verse 1: Mann]

Hey girl
To get to you I'll do whatever it takes girl
Word around town that I'mma player, They just some haters
Im just a young cat thats about his paper
Call me Mann Baby
All them other girls want to be Mann's lady
I just need you because your so damn wavy
Tell me what you say please
Be the Bey to my Jay-Z, yeah
And we ain't gotta deal with Ego's
Baby girl that ain't my steelo
Everybody want to tell you what they know
But give me a chance to tell you what I know
I know that your beautiful
From your hairdo down to your cuticles
Im not here to play I'm here to stay
And everything gone be ok, babe

[Hook: Mann]

[Verse 2: Mann]

Love, What everybody about
The reason we be in the club partying and everybody's out
She dancing with half her body out
Without a doubt this girl bad
One exclamation point, all caps
Baby girl got that call back
She got that good good
Make a man greedy wanting all that
Falling in love this is all bad
Too soon, but it feel too good to ever fall back

Gucci up to the shades
