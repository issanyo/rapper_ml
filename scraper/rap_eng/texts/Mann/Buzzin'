[Hook: Mann]
Man I feel like money (man I feel like money)
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey (they come around like honey)
Cuz I'm fly like a bee
Man I got 'em all buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Man I got the world buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1: Mann]
Uh, back up to back up in the mix like that
And I know ya like it when it's just like that
All the girlies just love my swag
From my kicks to the way I fix my hat
I'm...back
Fresh like some new J's
Brodie got next NBA 2K
I'm too paid
Shaded with some ladies
Reppin' my city
West LA baby !
West LA made me this way
Two rules :
Stay fresh , homie and get paid
Hey !
Never broke and never bummy
I'm from where it's forever sunny

[Hook: Mann]
Man I feel like money (man I feel like money)
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey (they come around like honey)
Cuz I'm fly like a bee
Man I got 'em all buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Man I got the world buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Bridge: Mann]
When I come around, 'round, 'round
They go
Yeah, yeah it's going down, down, down
They go

[Verse 2: Mann]
New cat with a old school feel
Only new artist with a old school deal
Taught to the game by Steve Lobell
So we always win, don't receive no L's
New girls act like they know me so well
But I shows no love and be like oh well
When my album drops , sure as hell gon' sell
Stack cash and laugh like L-O-L

[Hook: Mann]
Man I feel like money (man I feel like money)
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey (they come around like honey)
Cus I'm fly like a bee
Man I got 'em all buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Man I got the world buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Saying all the things that I wanna hear

And as the night ends
I'mma have her and get all her friends

Okay , hands in the air (Yee-uh)
From the back to the front
Everywhere

Throwin' out 20's
Throwin' out hundreds
Ladies gotta love it
