[Hook: Mann]

Recieve
I give it to you
I give it to you
Then I receive
You give it to me
You give it to me
What a relief, Release
Then we breathe, and Then we Leave
Peace

[Verse: 1 Mann]

Receive, all the things that I believe
The world is so new to me I'll be the Adam you be my Eve
Follow this follow this follow this as far as the eye can see
She knows the real me I'm not as cold as I tried to be
I told that bitch lie to me, So I can wife her up
And live in another reality, Thats probably nice as fuck
Instead she's just a fan, and I'm just trying to fuck
For some reason I feel like god made this special time for us
We're soul mates...for the night and next morning
Lets get to know each other Im searching and exploring
For more than whats on the surface
To be frank it gets boring
Im more into to finding about what this woman's Moral core is
Only been around each other, for four hours now
Got her in my room with nothing on but a towel wow, wow
I'mma make it a night to remember trust
Don't worry about nothing mamma be quiet just

[Hook: Mann]

Soul Swapping, spirit switching, we sharing something
Something special so pay attention or your learning nothing
Your body's scrumptious I couldn't resist I had to taste it
Your fascinated my sense of touch is by far the greatest
Look at the love we made from nothing ain't that amazing
Who knew I could feel this good in bed with a total stranger
But yolo and those phrases occupy my brain so
Im giving and getting brain from this no name, Miss Jane Doe
Jane do, Jane do, When you came, I knew exactly what you came fo
You want a glimpse of the life, with me you came close
But when we're done after everything we became ghost
We will probably never speak, contact we'll never keep
Keeping it G you'll be out my memory after a week
So lets live in the present like the future don't exist
Lets quit the bullshit girl get up on this dick and

[Hook}

[Verse 3: Do Proper]

I give it to her like I don't want it no more
We can exchange a little game on my part
Darts from a flying arch
And the targets on that heart booty
Clear shots but partially
Cloudy when you come around me
We can hold it down and
You can bring that friend in
I cosign you befriended
Watching while those vices tempt me
Heavy level headed but the devils present
Girl this is the devil's present, Take this shit
Who gives a fuck we adolescence Kind of... shit
But who's trying to remind us
Treat me like the old days, and let a nigga get behind ya
My Hyena, my Ruka
This 40 ounce is the true love
A little bit of that Ohh Ahh
That beck and call your friend come
I wink at the fact that
You fuck with what I'm hinting at
So hit that and sit calm
My life is a sitcom so fuck with me
Three's company, So fuck with me
Because 3's company
