[Intro: Mann]
Uh
I'm smoking dope all alone
Uh

[Verse One]
Son of the universe
Don't know what to do at first
Learn through trial and error
Just gotta do what works

Study the clues on Earth
Climbing the human ladder
Just wanna do what matters
Before I go in that hearse

No more going backwards
No more holding back words
The truth i throw in that verse
Don't need to go to that church

I'm sure
I'm knowing the truth
I'm go in and glow in the booth
Wanna hear you go is the proof
But without practice
You probably wouldn't know what to do

I'm here with the real
Bullshit came with the deal
I'm free and I'm here in the field
Showing that life is more than sight
Smell, taste, what you hear and you feel

Chill
What we reveal
Some of them theories are filled
With silver lining
In a world filled with science
Finding the answers deal with the Mayans

[Bridge]
The signs I interviewed
The world dies
When we produce
Every time
I see the news like
"They lyin'"
Me and you and
I'm tryin'

To keep it cool
So I get high
To ease the mood
But my mind
Is diving deep
To define
The spiritual

I'm living the physical soul
And my body's a vehicle
And I'm driving it into
The sippy sinful sex, drugs
Rock 'n' roll

Don't judge me for what I'm into
Young, trying to find a soul
Walking on a thin road

[Chorus x2]
I'm smokin' dope
Smokin' dope all alone
And no one knows
I'm paranoid blowing strong

Overdose
I hope I don't overdose
If you love me, hold me close
Then hold me close
Hold me close

[Verse Two]
Expanded world awareness
Despite the fact
The way we live in this world is careless
Where we know more than our parents

How I'm Feeling?
Don't label me a terrorist
Anti-Government politics, fuck all that shit
My purpose for living above all that shit

No need for no scholarships
And no colleges
This world's a web
Don't get caught in it

For that nonsense
I'm low tolerance
So I'ma just flow

On this bowl
Smoke on this dope
Ride on this Ride
Get high on the low low

[Bridge]
There's so much that I
Don't know
Feel it up in my
Soul Though

This movement
We a part of it
So I'ma spark this shit
Solo

No shame
In the game
Taking his per-
-sonal plane to the brain

[Chorus x2]

[Outtro x2]
Hold me close
I think I'm seeing ghosts
Goes deeper than you know
Hard for me to cope

Lost in all the smoke
And mirrors
Screaming out for love
I hope they hear us
Hope they hear us

[Chorus x2]
