[Intro]


[Verse 1: Mann]
This what they been waiting on
Damn Mann why it take so long
I was getting my revelation on
Fuck shit I can't condone
Ready to spark this thing alone
Dubs in the air yeah we paying homage
West LA player stay blazing chronic
Life in the Grey every day's Ironic
Say the shit that keep Peace Life staying conscious
Aw yeah they let the Daniels in
God Bless everyone who is a fan of him
Uh, I got them paying attention
Young nigga O.G. been in this game for a minute
Now I got it I ain't playing with it
Grown man now handle grown man business
I can't stand limits
Break it down while my fans witness, its Mann

[Hook: Mann]
Uh, Smoke one for Yump Daniels [Uh, Yeah smoke some]
Smoke one for Yump Daniels [Come on man come on, come on]
Smoke one for Yump Daniels
Smoke one for Yump Daniels [Smoke up]
YUMP

[Verse 2: Mann]
The world changing so fucking fast
I hope the weak shit doesn't last
We the Future, Fuck the past
Talks of Revolutions, I'm loving that
All shots at the upper class
Men turned snakes for the love of cash
Watch your back bruh cut the grass
Matter fact cats a rat for a couple racks
Keep it cool is the only rule
I only do what he told me to
I talked to God he told me go be you
And spread love like we supposed to do
And that herb won't roll itself
At concerts smoking out because we share the wealth
A Mann show good for your health
Peace Life participation I need your help

[Hook: Mann]

[Bridge: Mann]

This what they been waiting on
This what they been waiting on
This what they been waiting on
Damn Mann why it take so long
