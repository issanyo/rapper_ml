I'm growing up, now shit is showing up on the internet
Now everybody and they mama know
Facebook pictures and tweets on Twitter, no more hiding it
Now everybody and they mama know
So right now I'mma take some time out to show you my lifestyle
I ain't no child no mo'

[Verse 1]
Rock star lifestyle: turned up off the wall
Whether I'm smoking weed, intoxicated of alcohol
Party like a child star, that mean stupid wild hard
Winning with the swag by far, always a bad bitch in my car
Never in my right mind, always searching for that high
In the club I'm that guy, niggas always wanna give me daps, fives
Pounds and shit if Im around your bitch, then I'm probably gon' pull her

They taking pics cause I'm famous, and his chick I took cause I'm cooler
So please forget your boyfriend, she sick of it, she bored with him
She sees what's important, you see the car? He can't afford this
European Whip, She Foreign, Put my key in, performing

Like warning, I'm going in, it's 4AM, and I'm flooring it

[Hook 1]
It's 4AM and I'm flooring it
It's 4AM in the morning
It's 4AM and I'm flooring it, I'm flooring it
It's 4AM in the morning
It's 4AM in the morning
It's 4AM and I'm flooring it
It's 4AM and I'm flooring it
It's 4AM in the morning

[Verse 2]
Into some thangs, that mama won't condone
I been out all night, it's way too late to go home
I'mma hit up my partners, one of them niggas gon' pick up the phone
Twisted a bit of the vodka, one more shot and I would've been gone
Thank God for my girlfriend, designated driving the young
I'm grown, I'm grown, one year under twenty-one
But I'm still drunk, what to expect? In the club like every night
Learned the perfect shaded up recipe: that's the pro-medicine mixed with the sprite
I'm drinking it, cause she pourin' it, going deeper in: exploring it
Like warning, I'm going in, it's 4AM, and I'm flooring

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]
4AM, and I'm flooring
4AM, and I'm flooring
4AM, and I'm flooring, I'm flooring
It's 4AM in the morning
It's 4AM in the morning
It's 4AM and I'm flooring, I'm flooring
It's 4AM in the morning
