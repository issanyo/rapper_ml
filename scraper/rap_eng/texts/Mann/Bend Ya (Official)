[Hook - Frank Ocean]
All the spoons in my kitchen
(Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
(They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
(bend, I bend, I bend, I bend)
Beend it girl, beend it girl..

[Verse 1- Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, Soon as I enter
I put a hurting on it
If I don’t kill it she injured
For a Long time
Summer, spring and winter
Fall for anything, you clumsy ass nigga
Jumping off the boat in some 87' Locs
She’s seen them hundred spokes
And then that woman spoke
But I don’t talk back, I put my life on tracks
If that don’t work put your wife on track
Show me where the candle wax
It must be you, cuz I burn right through
Everything ya’ll do
High octane when I bring on my last name
Mr. Lamar AKA “The Cash King"
Quicker than pre-cum won’t you give her a reason;
To not meet up with me like a vegan
Psssst! God-Damn I’m the fuckin man
She said fuck her man
Now she fuck with Mann

[Hook - Frank Ocean]

[Verse 2- Mann]
Everytime I close my eyes I see a different dream
I pray to God that we don’t close until we reach our dreams
College tuition for daughters and I ain’t even father
Now I got a rebel at the altar call me prince or king
Six digits for me like we did to offer
I used to call me Waldo, and now they call me Walter
Yeah, I hide in them uckle pants, living without a purpose, man
But that just got my circumstances
And I mean it, if you want it, come and get it, boy
Death come in threes and you’re looking like triplets boys
In high school I climbed the roof so I could smoke my weed
The dealers knew that I was young and sold me bag of seeds
I’m chasing dreams, hoes chasing me
But I just gave the name and number like the maitre D
‘cause all I wanna do was roll up hash and smash the ass of a bitch who lived like Kim Kardashian

[Hook - Frank Ocean]

[Verse 3- Mann]
She is the last straw, I’ve bend her and slip slow
My pencil draws her closer, she gets high and bends low
Long flight from my Cali mistress, to a district with red lights
Prostitutes and rich niggas, just a recipe for long nights
Shake well and all they do, I’m laying next to some girl who last night showed me things I never knew
Either I’m bending space out or I’m just bending space in
I put my heart on tracks, but it’s four AM and that chick’s still racing
One bed, two girls, three way, four times
My shame came off their clothes, it’s paradise of the mind
Absolute vodka mixed with absolute freedom
I meet my darker side and it’s a pleasure just to meet him
I’m thinking about puffing and writing while fucking
Yesterday’s gone and tomorrow ain’t come
And if tomorrow ain’t come and that’s the name that she told me
But when you hit this level, every first name is phoneme
But here, the air tastes better, weed is more potent and girls seem wetter
Days are a haze and drinks just stronger, nocturnal nigga, these nights seem longer
I’m only here for one night, it’s Disneyland for man, white girls, blue kush, red lights
America and Amster…damn
