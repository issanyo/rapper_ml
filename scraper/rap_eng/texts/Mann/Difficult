There hasn't been a female who could handle me
They switch the service up and pay the early cancel fee
I don't think I'm difficult, but hey who ever does?
But if they give up so quick than it was never love
I learned to deal, what the deals are like
I'm to young to find a wife and start to realise
It sound real nice to have a topper in the story
I have to leave her happy after to thank her for it
But I guess it ain't for me, the world is so shady
The broads feel me 'cause I get the girls we know crazy
I always hit 'em with those other problems oh the old ladies
Now I gotta play her, before she gon' play me
Baby I don't get mad I get even
And I don't fall in love no more, I have specific reasons
No demonic girls, all of them have been deceivin'
Hard as a stone and a victim of threesomes

You know
All these girls they think I'm difficult
And I be like so?
I ain't got no time to deal with no silly

Now what's the deal?
Am I difficult, well maybe just a lil'
But I'm just the type that acts on how I feel
Would you rather be lied, than keep it real?
That's what I don't, nah
Tell if it's wrong if I wanna flawless brawless strong shift with a strong grip
Of what life is about - degree in college
So she can share with me - give me some knowledge
I hope you're following what I'm saying
I need a girl who knows how to treat a man right
So many don't make it a shame
So I'm tryna get 'em pimped to this game
It ain't as hard as it seems
All you gotta do is play the part of the queen
Stop tryna be the king all the time
And you ain't have to tell me everything that's on your mind
Cuz I ain't really tryna hear it
I ain't a therapist, maine I'm not the ...
Maybe I should be solo, who needs a ballad?
Honestly, once I think about it

[Hook]
You know
Maybe your the one who's difficult
And I don't
Really have time to deal with no silly
