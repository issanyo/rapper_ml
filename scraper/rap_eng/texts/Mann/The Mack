[Iyaz - Hook]
Return of the mack (Come On)
Return of the mack (Once again)
Return of the mack (I Knew)
Cause you know that I'll be back (Yeah)

[Mann -- 1st Verse]
Here come the brand new new in your ear
This feels like the nominated song of the year
Feeling damn good up in here
Cause I'm representing from my whole hood up in here
But I'm not gonna get ghetto though
Mingling with some women feeling incredible
And I'm tryna bag a chick from a centrefold and I'm trying burn bread like its finna be toast
Finally up in the game and feeling me coach
Cause I'm first class flying I ain't finna be coach
Yeah this is celebration that never in tell a friend girl, the mack is back

[Iyaz -- Hook]
We can take it back and hit the streets
Let the top down so they can see
We can hit the clubs and party hard
Cause I just bought out the bar
We can g-fly from coast to coast
Pop champagne let's make a toast
Now we're sipping caffe patron
Smoke that kush till we get blown
Return of the mack (C'mon)
Return of the mack (Once again)
Return of the mack (I knew)
Cause you know that I'll be back (Yeah)

[Mann -- Bridge]
Let me hear you say yeah
Let me hear you say west
Let me hear you say yeah
Every day we stay fresh, fresh

[Snoop Doggy Dogg -- 2nd Verse]
I got keys to whatever
Trees of endeavour
Mann, he is buzzin', and he's on my level
Ease on the pedal, drive off slow
Seven deuce Cadillac is convertible
She wanna be with the mack at it's best
Dogg in the house while I'm cranking it bad
They say, we say, you say don't
Take it to the top now drop it down low
Meat on my back, snooped it and booted it
Cripped out, pimped out
What would you do if he me
Would you hop on a freak while you bop to the beat
Now we can take it back and hit the streets

[Iyaz - Hook]
(Now we can take it) back and hit the streets
Let the top down so they can see
We can hit the clubs and party hard
Cause I just bought out the bar
We can g-fly from coast to coast
Pop champagne let's make a toast
Now we're sipping caffe patron
Smoke that kush till we get blown
Return of the mack (C'mon)
Return of the mack (Once again)
Return of the mack (I knew)
Cause you know that I'll be back (Yeah)

[Mann - Verse 3]
Honey if I gotta think money clipping'
Than he broker than a joke at it's funniest
And man never call me crip with the lavish life
So one time off, I won't ask you twice
When we go shopping, mama don't ask the price
Got to get it down if they give me cash advice
When it comes to this game I'm a mastermind
I spit classic line after classic line
Ha, and that ass is fine
Think it's one past the nine and that's a dime
Yeah, it's a celebration then
Never in, tell a friend girl that the mack is back, baby

[Iyaz - Hook]
(Now we can take it) back and hit the streets
Let the top down so they can see
We can hit the clubs and party hard
Cause I just bought out the bar
We can g-fly from coast to coast
Pop champagne let's make a toast
Now we're sipping caffe patron
Smoke that kush till we get blown
Return of the mack (C'mon)
Return of the mack (Once again)
Return of the mack (I knew)
Cause you know that I'll be back (Yeah)

[Mann - Outro]
Let Me Hear You Say Yeah
Let Me Hear You Say West
Let Me Hear You Say Yeah
Everyday we stay fresh (Fresh)
