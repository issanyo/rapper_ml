[Intro]
Mann, Casey Veggies
Go ahead like
Know what I'm saying girl
(All my LA girls, let me see your hands)
I ain't really got time for all that playing, you know what I'm saying
I need you to get straight to the point, you feel me
You wanna mess with the winning niggas, know what I'm saying
Get with the program

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Girl I could put you on my Superbowl team
Young nigga a team but I do my damn thing
You a queen, spend the night, we gon' do it right
But keep it in the dark, yeah hit the lights
She know that we winning so she happy when she roll with us
Said I'm kind of young but I'm shining on them old niggas
My crib, me and you, so many things we could do
Call me Young Veggies, girl no vitamin C though
Straight to the hole and I hit the free throw
And I took your girl homie, something like repo
Cause she said she wanna go where a G go
Please don't play me, I just rap and keep it real
That's what she did with me when she told me how she feel
Yeah, yeah
No court, no appeal
She's just locked behind my bars and she waiting for her meal
Young Veggies

[Verse 2: Mann]
Hey lil mama, I heard you like 'em young and fly
Can't say I'm surprised, a Big Mac amongst a bunch of fries
My love is live like something you never had
If I get this chick, you'll never get her back, hella swag
Never brag, I don't need to
My ora speak for me and it's saying I'm a G, fool
No there's no equal, no wonder what he do
No Hollywood story, won't catch me on E! True
Me too, cool for that, for real
I chose up on you so what's the deal
Let me know if you rolling like you off a pill
Fly shit, we could go to a loft and chill
Play a video game if you down to
Wrestle in the bed, I'm the champ in round two
Let me know if it sound cool to keep it real
Ever since I found you, all I wanna do is be around you
