It dont take much to keep that shit real
Claim you 100 but show how you ain't real
Im all about my money the way that I feel
Ain't about money can't pick up the phone
Switched on your nigga
What the fuck is you on
My lil bih bad
She bad to the bone
She get what she want when she call on my phone
Come in the door she wearing heels and a thong

Beat up the pussy have her out til the morning
Dick her mouth
Catch it right when she yawning
Smack her on the ass
Grip her hair when she moaning


(chorus)
Her ex niggas mad casue they see what im doing
Back against the wall
You better be there when I fall
Ain't really feeling this love shit at all
Too many Iâ€™s
Turn myself into a boss
She like when I go in and beat up her walls
Dog in the streets but a freak in the sheets
She getting mad cause my song stay on repeat
Grindin real hard
Ain't nothin for free
Need me a real one to sweep right off her feet
Head on the swivle when im up in the streets
Gettin real hot but I gotta keep me a heat
Bust on your back cause im smacking the cheek when she moaning

Keep you a duece if you riding with me
If im shooting for you then you shooting for me
Stuck in this shit like a lock and the key
Talking bout rounds
We go bout like 3
If you riding with me then where else would we be
Nobody in the streets can be where we be
Take you to places you never damn seen
Now pass me my Glock and a new magazine
We fuck like porno we switching the scenes
Most of these niggas ain't real as they seem
You won't understand unless you seen what I seen
You saying you love me
Tell me what the fuck it mean
