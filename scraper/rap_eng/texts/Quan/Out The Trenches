(Chorus)
Only got two one ways in the trenches
Better keep you a Glock and a mask in the trenches
Feds come don’t say shit up in the trenches
Nigga talkin run down then you know we gotta finish
Kill a nigga mother can’t leave no witness
Remember nights niggas didn’t even have me a penny
Stayed up all night just so I can bag me a nigga
Just tryna get a better way up out these trenches

Just tryna get a better way up out these trenches
Grindin too hard cause I need me a million
Most of these niggas never slept in the trenches
Remember them nights wasn’t no food in the kitchen
Seen niggas locked up, dead or in prison
Seen bro get it now I gotta go get it
Won't stop grinding til my niggas got a million
Came in the car and I dropped the damn ceiling

You’ll never understand the way that im living
Reading through niggas like im reading through scriptures
I be itching and waiting to drop me a nigga
Poppin a perc just to give me some feeling
I get way real high in the sky just to see all you haters
Niggas be talking them niggas be haters
Im two steps ahead of these niggas
Walk down with a Glock double trigger
Niggas hated cause im back in the skrilla
Been in the streets and I been a real nigga
Seen my daddy in the kitchen

(Chorus)
Only got two one ways in the trenches
Better keep you a Glock and a mask in the trenches
Feds come don’t say shit up in the trenches
Nigga talkin run down then you know we gotta finish
Kill a nigga mother can’t leave no witness
Remember nights niggas didn’t even have me a penny
Stayed up all night just so I can bag me a nigga
Just tryna get a better way up out these trenches
