[Hook: quan, d.rose]
Trying to take a nigga down
Run into a nigga house
First thing D.rose say is "what the fuck is it about"
I done scoped the house out
Guns all under the couch
Grandma stay knocked out
So gone bail in and then bail out
2x

[Verse 1: D.rose]
WHAT THE FUCK IS IT ABOUT
ROSE PULL DA 40 OUT
PUT THAT BITCH UP TO HIS MOUTH
AND TELL HIS ASS  GET ON THE GROUND!
PUT HIS BRAINS UP ON THE COUCH
GRAB THE MERCH AND THEN BAIL OUT
YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT
I'LL NEVER SELL YOU OUT
I KNOW THIS SHIT WITHOUT A DOUBT
MY HOMIE RAN UP IN MY HOUSE
HAD TO BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT
CAUSE I KNEW HE SOLD ME OUT
I SINKED THE BLOOD NIGGER CRAP
NOW I GOTTA TAKE DIS ROUTE
BACK TO COUNT A LARGER AMOUNT
WHAT THE FUCK IS IT ABOUT!
