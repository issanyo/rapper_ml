[Verse 1: James' Dodgers] Uh, Willie James aye ain't you that insane man/ Draw more lines then a game of fucking hangman/ niggas say they fresh but No Mercy stay fresher/ Lay down more tracks then black bitches hair dressers/ never sever bitches body parts/ rape her in the parking lot shes a lame so ill rape her in the handy parking spot/ see if they be catching us faggots ya'll ain't catching up/ my girlfriends a dyke she just text-ed me say she strapping up/ gotta bounce heading out head is what its all about/ James' murder competition slaughter em without a doubt/ take a midgets baby stuff it in a man canon and/ if my dick is small yo pussy is the grand canyon see me standing/ with my army all open like dropping jaws/ my nickname is Glock 10 because I'm always popping off/ bombs is what I'm dropping off topping charts I'm topping all/ lightening in a bottle so they call my flow a Molotov...bitch

[Verse 2:Quan] up on the beat like dying bitches in surgery you jump up in the fridge but never less as cold as me/ I want more followers then Hitler was up in Germany/ so people can just praise and obey my quanice for quan can see/ the stars and destroy other rappers careers and making songs/ eating bars like fat bitches be lining cars want the world to notice me like charity/ for it can give me money and brainwash they tendencies/ Powerhouse we light up don't even give a fuck got grays with birds and flying ducks/ that shit is fucked/ red eyes with dead lies that rot like fruit on a table for days/ no surprise they say I'm on the bottom but the game is riding me/ but then I push it off for it can say hi to me/ now in the face of hip-hop that don't stop and give me head until my brains pop...yeah
