Post it up on weekend trip
All my peeps
Heading out feeling finger licking
All freshed up
Ready for touching
I'm your little chula
Straight out of Brooklyn
What's the play
Ain't smoking some days
We had a lot of fun
Last time we parlayed
Cheack it
Swoop through
So I can see you
Check the back lift the mat
No clue
What ima do to you
Can you
Can you come see me tonight
Why
'cause I've been thinking about you all day
My parents are gone and I'm all alone
So won't you swing my way
Can you
Can you come see me tonight
Why
'cause I've been thinking about you all day
My parents are gone and I'm all alone
So won't you swing my way
Dim the lights
Light the candles relaxing
Smell real good
Ready for maxing
If the cards play right
Never know what could happen

Stay game tight
Gopt no time for slacking
Me and you first time we're alone
And around our friends only talk on the phone
Come on through 'cause I like your stylo
I'm fit to tip
We'll do whatever you wanna do
Can you
Can you come see me tonight
Why
'cause I've been thinking about you all day
My parents are gone and I'm all alone
So won't you swing my way
Can you
Can you come see me tonight
Why
'cause I've been thinking about you all day
My parents are gone and I'm all alone
So won't you swing my way
No problem mommacita
You want it - I'll cum & 'G' ya
As soon as I move dis re-up da times free'ah ta see ya
Flyhood in ya neighborhood
Heavy Prezzle Bezzie Gem'd up
White on white air ones
All on your mommaz lawn
Fitted bent low
No one knows who I'm creepin' on
What you seek find Quan learn why they call me don
While fiend'n for me to move forward like my name Lebron
And when it comes to cardz playin' the hand ain't nothing
I'm a dealer most of deez otha dudez just frontin'
And you could learn something if we build together
And if you act right I might sing a song to make ya feel better
