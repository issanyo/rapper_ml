Hello

This time you was wrong, I ain't had no bitch
No trick, no hoe all over my dick
This time you was wrong, you say you got evidence
Fuck that girl, you know you ain't really got shit
This time you was wrong

I know them other times you caught a nigga cheatin' red handed
Yeah girl, I admit it, this time you was wrong
Make a nigga wanna holla, oh Lord
I ain't never met a bitch that tried to swallow so hard

As soon a nigga fall asleep you all in a nigga phone
I swear you can't wait to catch a nigga doin' wrong
You lookin' under rocks tryna find a dirty stone
Before you catch me in the A you prolly see me up and gone

And girl, I ain't tryna leave me and you alone
But girl, I'm sick and tired of all this petty shit you on
So before you fuck it up you better listen to this song
'Cause when I choose to up and leave you gon' swear I did you wrong

Yeah, I did a lot of dirt back then I admit
But don't forget you did a lot a shit a nigga won't forget
'Cause I'm tired of the fightin', the drama, the shit
Should I leave? Should I peel like a banana and split?

And girl I'ma warn you one time, this the last time
Next time I'ma be lame, na, na, na, na
Make a nigga wanna holla, oh Lord
I ain't never met a bitch that tried to swallow so hard

This time you was wrong, I ain't had no bitch
No trick, no hoe all over my dick
This time you was wrong, you say you got evidence
Fuck that girl, you know you ain't really got shit
This time you was wrong

I know them other times you caught a nigga cheatin' red handed
Yeah girl, I admit it, this time you was wrong
Make a nigga wanna holla, oh Lord
I ain't never met a bitch that tried to swallow so hard

Girl, witchu it's never endin', everyday is like a game
Don't matter how we do it everyday I'm in the same
All that Internet bullshit drivin' me insane
You tell your son, thanks for grinnin', its gon' leave you in the rain

And girl, I ain't sayin' I'm caught up in the fame
But you gotta understand that you ain't fuckin' with a lame
So when these bitches flip down and try to sabotage my name
You shouldn't leave and get to trippin', you should recognize the game

'Cause you know these hoes choosin' and I know these hoes fake
But see you listen to your friends and that right there be there your mistake
Plus I'm tired of all the stressin', very little I can take
Can I live? Can I breathe? Should I leave? Should I stay?

And girl I'ma warn you one time, this the last time
Next time I'ma be lame, na, na, na, na
Make a nigga wanna holla, oh Lord
I ain't never met a bitch that tried to swallow so hard

This time you was wrong, I ain't had no bitch
No trick, no hoe all over my dick
This time you was wrong, you say you got evidence
Fuck that girl, you know you ain't really got shit
This time you was wrong

I know them other times you caught a nigga cheatin' red handed
Yeah girl, I admit it, this time you was wrong
Make a nigga wanna holla, oh Lord
I ain't never met a bitch that tried to swallow so hard

You had me with a throw the towel in, give it up
'Cause you ain't gonna be satisfied 'til I go
You make me wanna take away my love
Kiss your ass goodbye now girl, but I ain't tryna put on now show

You make me wanna walk right out that door
You make me wanna walk right out that door
You make me wanna pack my shit
And when I pack my shit girl, I ain't comin' back no more

Yeah, you best believe that
Girl, you causin' me to stress
One thing that I suggest, I think you should invest
Yeah, you best believe that

The main problem to address
You don't know what you possess
And that's why we don't progress
And you best believe that

I'ma take my time 'til I make my mind
Should I stay? Should I go? Na, na, na, na
You make a nigga wanna holla, oh Lord
I ain't never met a bitch that tried to swallow so hard

This time you was wrong, I ain't had no bitch
No trick, no hoe all over my dick
This time you was wrong, you say you got evidence
Fuck that girl, you know you ain't really got shit
This time you was wrong

I know them other times you caught a nigga cheatin' red handed
Yeah girl, I admit it, this time you was wrong
Make a nigga wanna holla, oh Lord
I ain't never met a bitch that tried to swallow so hard
This time you was wrong
