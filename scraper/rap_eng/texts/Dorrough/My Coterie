Whoa

[Hook]
Four in the mornin' she can't get a hold of me
I pay the mortgage, she can't lock the door on me
I'ma just mouthpiece her down with this floetry
I got more women than K-Ci in Jodeci
See me pull up in that thing, you gon' know it's me
Earrings and watches and chains you gon' notice me
Haters and bitches and money all over me
Clique full of bottles yeah, yeah that's my coterie
All of my niggas drapped down in my coterie
All of my niggas drapped down in my coterie

All of my niggas drapped down in my coterie

[Verse 1]
I took your bitch then I fucked her with no delay
Showin' her how to get money my protege
She like to eat the dick up like a funnel cake
Haters hate the fact they can't take the funds away
Walk in the club, I'm like, "Money May, Money May"
Soon as we leave we gon' make us a money play
Put some respek on my name just like Stunna say
Pull out that drop just cause it's a sunny day
Droppin' hits with no label
Do this shit cause I'm able
She just after my paper
I'll fuck, but won't save her
The bitch say she gon' leave
Just don't know she doin' me a favor
Just don't know, I want new flavors
Mix the shit up, turn tables
Real niggas get real respect
Trill niggas gonna intersect
Left the city we done came back
Where y'all been, where the millions at?
Perpetrate like y'all got the check
Ehhh wrong, that's incorrect
We gonna do it for a real check
Y'all do it for the Internet

But my black girl gotta white girl
White girl brought her best friend
Straight 10, nothin' less than
Real ones in my section
Nah, I don't fuck with no yes men
I smoke buddah like Redman
And I get it from the West End
From the Southside to the East Coast
Big black Ghost with the seat's smoked
She ride my dick 'till the seat's soaked
Fuck around and catch a heat stroke
She kinda shy, but I can't lie
