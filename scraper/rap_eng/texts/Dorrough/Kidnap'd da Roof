[Hook]
Pull up in that brand new coupe (amber alert!)
Somebody kidnapped the roof, somebody kidnapped the roof
Somebody kidnapped the roof
Pulled up and that bitch was gone
Somebody kidnapped the roof, somebody kidnapped the roof
Somebody kidnapped the roof
Pulled up and that bitch was ahh
Somebody kidnapped the roof, somebody kidnapped the roof
Somebody kidnapped the roof
Pulled up and that bitch was gone
Somebody kidnapped the roof, somebody kidnapped the roof
Somebody kidnapped the roof
Pulled up and that bitch was ahh

[Verse 1]
Minute Maid, I got the juice
Candy paint, look like some fruit
Factory rims on the coupe
Pull out and throw you the deuce
Been out here gettin' this money, my nigga
And all you can do is salute
You do not wanna compete with me, nigga
You better off making a truce
I'm not a vegan, but I keep at least 24-Karat a tooth
That nigga that say he got numbers on me
Somebody please show me the proof
You didn't hear that I was taking shit over?
How long have you been out the loop?
I am the one on the fast break
Somebody please throw me the oop
I met a bitch at the mall, got her number
And I can not lie, she was cute
We left, cause she told me she wanna go back to the telly and kick it like Bruce (Lee!)
I had don found me some condoms and needed to put all them bitches to use
I wasn't feelin' the convo at all
So I fucked her and cut the bitch loose
Weed got me higher than Zeus
Hennessy, I don't drink Goose
Girl let me give you to scoop
That nigga you fuckin' a goof
Me and my niggas been on it, we ballin' way harder than niggas that hoop
Watch me

[Hook]
Pull up in that brand new coupe (amber alert!)
Somebody kidnapped the roof, somebody kidnapped the roof
Somebody kidnapped the roof
Pulled up and that bitch was gone
Somebody kidnapped the roof, somebody kidnapped the roof
Somebody kidnapped the roof
Pulled up and that bitch was ahh
Somebody kidnapped the roof, somebody kidnapped the roof
Somebody kidnapped the roof
Pulled up and that bitch was gone
Somebody kidnapped the roof, somebody kidnapped the roof
Somebody kidnapped the roof
Pulled up and that bitch was ahh

[Verse 2]
Shame that you haven't yet noticed, that everyday your girlfriend got an excuse
She's busy right now she can't get to her phone
Cause she's blowin' my dick like a flute
Im not just a rapper, I like doin' business
I put money out and recoup
I'm a corporate executive owner, my nigga
I might just step out in a suit
I'm all about stacking my loot, that's all that I'm tryna produce
My pockets were really acute
Now both of them bitches obtuse
Yea everyone say they the realest, I get it
But honestly, I am the truth
When from smokin' it out on a stoop, to BET stages with Snoop
(007)
I stay on a mission just like the American troops
Last time I was solo, but this time we comin' in groups
Straight fire, I'm glad there's no gasoline up in the booth
One question, why the fuck would I get on the mic like this, and kill it? This shit is abuse
True to the root
Cooler than ice, hotter than soup
Both of these verses dont really got nothin' to do with a roof
But I like the way that it sound
I also just wanted to...

Somebody kidnapped the roof, somebody kidnapped the roof
Somebody kidnapped the roof
Pulled up and that bitch was gone
Somebody kidnapped the roof, somebody kidnapped the roof
Somebody kidnapped the roof
Pulled up and that bitch was ahh
