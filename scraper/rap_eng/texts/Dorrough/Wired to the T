"T! T! Wired to the T!"

[Dorrough - Verse 1]
Oh my! (Oh my!) Guess who (Guess who?)
Mr. D-O-double R-O-U
To the G-H, do I know you? (Whaaa??)
Yea get it girl, show 'em how a pro do
Wired to the T, I got the whole club
Wired to the T, man hol' up (yeah!)
Wired to the T - if I like it I'm gon' throw dubs
So gon; drop it down, make ya ass in the flo' world, girl
I'm, gettin money like ya ain't never seen
So, shake it for me when ya see me on the scene, gon'
Get it in like a double shift worker, girl
Stack yo' cheese like a double cheesburger, ayy!

[Hook]
Is the party gon' end? NO!
Might be three, might be fo'
If I cain't drink, then I cain't go
This song got e'rybody on the flo'
T! T! Wired to the T!
T! T! Wired to the T!
T! T! Wired to the T!
T! T! Wired to the T!

[Verse 2wo]
Mo'! Mo'! we want mo'!
If we cain't drink, den we cain't go
If they gon' hate, then let dem know
I slide me a hater like a patio door
Off in my zone, already gone
One, two, three, fo' shots to the dome
Now I'm drunk, got lil' mama crunk, tell 'er
(Shake it, shake it, shake it!)
Miss Junk-in-the-Trunk so crunk
Cause I'm outta dere befo' I even walk through the do'
And you know a nigga gone when he walk up to a ho
Like, "Excuse me miss, I ain't tryna be funny
Let me beat dat pussy like it owed me money, ayyy!"

[Hook]

[Break]
I got liquor in my body, liquor-liquor in my body
Liquor-liquor in my body, I-I got-I got
Liquor in my body, liquor-liquor in my body
Liquor-liquor in my body, I-I be-I be
Runnin through these hoes like I'm Tony Dorsett
Runnin-runnin through these hoes like I'm Tony Dorsett
Yeah, my whole clique fly like the New York Jets
We be runnin through these hoes like I'm Tony Dorsett

(T beat drop!)
Yo, say, this the part where you walk to lil' mama like
"Girl you fine! (Eyy!) Girl you fine! (Eyy!)
And after this song, I'mma make you mine, heyy!"

[Hook 2X]
