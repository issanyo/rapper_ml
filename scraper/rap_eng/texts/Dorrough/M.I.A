I don't care what they say
I live my life day by day
Like everything is ok
Guess that's the reason I pray
Light up and blow on this haze
Oh dirty take me away
Up there where I wanna stay
So I can be M-I-A

I say 24 hours 7 days a week
Been grindin so long I can do it in my sleep
You reap what you sew you sew what you reap
And when you get somethin good you hold and you keep it
Cuz when you got somethin somebody else won't it
Shinin on a hater feel real good don't it
Ridin on a hater sound real hood don't it
Before I take a L I'll kill my opponent
Last time hard this time go harder
Some do it big but the kids do it larger
Down town in the house by the water
Texas, Georgia, south beach Florida
Yea I do everything drastic
And I don't settle for nothin but fantastic
Pop pop on an X Y axis
Me and my click say lit like matches

I don't care what they say
I live my life day by day
Like everything is ok
Guess that's the reason I pray
Light up and blow on this haze
Oh dirty take me away
Up there where I wanna stay
So I can be M-I-A

Sunny and I ain't talkin bout Miami
Last year was good but this year I won a Grammy
Album in the streets but id rather much be
M-I-A just me and my family
Work all day double time all night
Show my baby girl that errthang alright
Live like a pimp that's our hype
Gotta thick chick 5'9 all tight
Gotta rent chick yeah I like all type
But my down there chick where tha bud all straight
I betchu think I'm just talkin
See her for ya self dime piece walkin
Speakin of walkin you can walk without crawlin first

You can't stand without fallin down and
When you down on the ground stand
Back up on the mound
And then swang harder

I don't care what they say
I live my life day by day
Like everything is ok
Guess that's the reason I pray
Light up and blow on this haze
Oh dirty take me away
Up there where I wanna stay
So I can be M-I-A

Yall and this is still good music
The world know I make real good music
Ain't got to but I'm still gonna prove it
Haters hate me but they still be groovin
Dont nobody know how long it took me to shine
Don't know body know how long it took me to grind
Sometimes dreams get lost by time
One night damn near lost my mind
Good things happen if you believe it
If you perceive it
You achieve it
This is motivation some of yall needed
Tryna help you see
So eliminate the negative
Insinuate the positive
Work none stop gettin money my prerogative
An yea I try to be cooperative
But when I keep it real some take it as derogative

I don't care what they say
I live my life day by day
Like everything is ok
Guess that's the reason I pray
Light up and blow on this haze
Oh dirty take me away
Up there where I wanna stay
So I can be M-I-A

Aaaaaaa so I can be M-I-A aaaaaaa
La lalalala la lalalalalala la lalalalalaala
