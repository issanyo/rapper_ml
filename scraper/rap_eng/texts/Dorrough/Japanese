[Verse 1]
Six 3 that nigga that they admire
Six 3 that nigga yo bitch desire
I dont do big rims no more I'm tired
I ran thru a hunnit Pirelli tires
Killin shit nigga I'm Michael Myers
My fans really love me I Get em wired
Congrats to my new bitches yall are hired
To all of my old bitches yall are fired
& This is like Kanye West through the wire
I Mix this shit up like its jambalaya
I splash everyday I need new atire
My weed get dropped off by an Uber driver
I get high alot im a frequent flyer
Smoking this shit I call yoga fire
Everything I spit is fuckin fire
If u disagree u a fuckin liar
If u disagree I don't give a damn
My only real issue is Uncle Sam
I'm lit up I can't put the boodah down
Smoking tree off in Hollywood hookah lounge
Smoking tree should be legalized everywhere
It's the closest thing we got to heaven Air
7 hoes In the room I make 7 stare
Tell the club have my table I'm headed there
At 22 I was a millionaire
I really wish I was a billionaire
Bun B say I'm trill ima trillionaire
They been sleeping on me fuckin grizzly bear
They been sleeping on me time to wake em up with no alarm I just grab em and Shake em up
I pullup and valet for 80 bucks
Tell the police stop chasing and Hating us
I get Capitol
Not a scavenger
Ima rapper that's real good at algebra
Ima rapper that's real good at calculus
Play with my money and I will come after Ya
They say I been gone that was temporary
I will be remembered as legendary
Just watch how I re-up in January
High as fuck I been blowing on Mary Mary

[Chorus]
Smoking this weed got me Japanese

[Verse 2]
Smoking this weed got me Japanese
If I cannot smoke then I have to leave
Got all of this jewelry I'm bout to Freeze
The Police be thinking I'm Trappin keys
Them Jordans just drop I want 2 of these
On 2nd thought I need a few of these
Yes I am the flyest I do believe
I'm Sick on the mic this a new disease
I'm tryna get money in everyway
I like doing shows cause it's steady pay
This Rapping I do this shit everyday
I Got rich off song bout a Chevrolet
The Modern day Penny Tim Hardaway
I think I might buy me a car today
I think I might po up Chardonnay
And plan me a vacation far way
I plan to one day win me a Grammy
Then move to the richest part of Miami
Cause I got the juice do u understand me
I make these bitches come out they panties
I make these bitches give up the pussy
I been on this shit I am not a rookie
All cross the world they be tryna book me
Been watching empire I need a cookie
It's us gainst the world fuck whoever oppose
Str8 out the Texas I been on the road
Six 3 that nigga I'm bout to explode
I got on some shoes they ain't seen what are those
Today was a good day I'm bout to get blowed
I got me some good weed thats ready rolled
If u a true smoker then anything goes
Backwoods and papers & Cigarillos

[Chorus]
Smoking this weed got me Japanese
