[Hook]
The city going crazy
We done finally made it
I'm so elevated
I feel so amazing
Niggas started hating
But it didn't phase me
I'm so fucking wavy
Prince from the 80's
Prince from the 80's
Prince from the 80's
Prince from the 80's
Prince from the 80's
Niggas started hating
But it didn't phase me
I'm so fucking wavy

[Verse 1: Dorrough Music]
Ooh wee baby, look what I created
Have you see me lately, I done upgraded
I can make it happen, I just need some motivation
(hits blunt)
That's my inspiration
All my bitches different, I don't like 'em basic
Just got a brand new one, met her off in Vegas
Thick, slim, cute face, full-blood Haitian
Nine times out of ten a bitch prolly crazy
It's a celebration, bottles of them Aces
We got 20 cases, that's outrageous
Trees got me hazy', drink got me lazy'
Going 180, beatin' up the pavement

[Verse 2: Go Yayo]
Diamonds dancing MC Hammer
(dancing)
I'm at the store with a blammer
Yo' bitch fell in love with my grammar
She fucked the gang and let us put it on camera
(movie)
Boy this hoe lit he look like a candle
You cuffin' that bitch, she a scandal
Gave her too much a dick she could handle
Take that bitch, that flip that ho like a channel
I'm trapping' like Tony Montana
I got that work in the 80s bae
Hood fame youngin i got 80 grand
Serve a nigga that pack then we take it back
[?]
Young nigga been snatchin' since way back
Hundred round drum nigga take that
200,000 cash on a Maybach
Cuff a youngin', boy you know we don't play that
Flow crazy, need a straight jacket
[?] my habitat
We gon trap until they come kick the door, because going back broke we ain't having that
All my youngins go dumb don't know how to act
These niggas know who brought the city back
