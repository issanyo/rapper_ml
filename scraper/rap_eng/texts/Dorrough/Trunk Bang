[Intro:]
Haa, kenwood good, amp turned up (know what I'm saying)
Say, I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof (Tum Tum on the track)
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang (Dorrough Music on the track)
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof (Mr. D-O Double R)
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang (D-Town on the map)
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof (kenwood good, amp turned up)
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang (kenwood good, amp turned up)
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof (kenwood good, amp turned up)
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang (Mr. D-O Double R)

[Verse 1: Dorrough]
Say, might swang wide body
Trunk gonna bang like a 12 gauge shotty
Now errbody crunk
Trunk gonna bang like a mossberg pump (mossberg)
Thowing uppercuts like Ryu
Trunk gonna bang like you claim Piru
Dirty South riding might swerve might dip
Trunk gonna bang like a West Coast crip
I wreck mics wit a passion
Trunk gonna bang like headboards clashing
Amp turned up, whole street rocking
Trunk gonna bang like 2 cops knocking
Like pinky and the brain, I ponder
Trunk gonna bang like flash flood thunder
People hate me like Bill O'Reiley
Trunk gonna bang like Pops off Friday

[Hook:]
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof (kenwood good, amp turned up)
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang (kenwood good, amp turned up)
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof (kenwood good, amp turned up)
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang

[Verse 2: Tum Tum]
BANG BANG BANG BANG you know how my Chevy dew
I'm in L-Town and I'm shaking up the Dallas Zoo
O after O bro you know how them bloods go
BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM here comes Zilla bro
Pigs on my ass told me "BETTER TURN IT DOWN BOY!"
Looked em in the face and said "I GOT BAIL MONEY HOE!"
You know how I pop doe, wrist all rocked up
So many speakers ain't no room in the whip slut
The kush got me fooling, Zilla man fooling
And if you chick smiling, your chick is choosing
350 boys pull out 350 toys
And the trunk bang like them 350 boys
Pull up in a dozier, smoking on fruity
My speakers bang like my dougie that's why you losing
Pull up in a doozie, smoking on fruity
My speakers bang like my dougie that's why you losing

[Hook:]
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof (kenwood good, amp turned up)
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang (kenwood good, amp turned up)
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof (kenwood good, amp turned up)
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang

[Verse 3: Dorrough]
Everything turned up, kenwood turned up
Let the trunk bang till the amp wire burned up
Got the block locked down, cut dawg top down
Let the trunk bang till the head rest drop down
Ice game caked up, draped out, draped up
Let the trunk bang make the whole hood wake up
My-my click stay live, yo-yo click ain't live
Trunk-trunk gonna bang like Ice Cream Paint Job
(uh yea buddy) Lex'd out, Lac truck stretched out
Trunk gonna bang like six 12's decked out (whoooa)
Check that inside jet black
Let the trunk bang with the sun roof let back
2 tone flip chain, lean back grip grain
Let the trunk bang make the Cadillac switch lanes
Damn is he balling ? you done heard right
Let the trunk bang make the whole car swerve right

[Hook:]
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof (kenwood good, amp turned up)
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang (kenwood good, amp turned up)
I pull up in the whip blowing smoke out the roof (kenwood good, amp turned up)
Trunk-trunk gonna bang, trunk-trunk gonna bang
