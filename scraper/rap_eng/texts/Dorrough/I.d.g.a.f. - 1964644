I woke up (woke up) pissed off (Why?)
I had twenty five missed calls (Damn)
Hustling, balling, Chris Paul
Lil momma said, Hey
I said
I done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I-don I-done came up
I.D.G.A.F., I don't give a fuck
I.D.G.A.F., (to the Styrofoam cups)
I-don I-done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
I.D.G.A.F., I don't give a fuck, no sir
I.D.G.A.F. (ha)
One life, live it up
Got the Jimmy strung tight
I ain't slipping up, no!
I pour syrup in a mini cup
I.D.G.A.F., I don't give a fuck (haa)
Shoe game, ace game
If I'm in a strip club, then it might rain
I-don I-done came down like an air-plane (prrnn)
Fuck around and came up in the dice game (whoo)
Got the doors on a brand new cooper, Upp
Watch your girl, cause she might get scooped up (yes)
Hit a ford dealership and bought about two trucks
Crazy thing, I didn't even give two fucks
Damn, charisma (ayy), fuck swagg
Catch me in the hood like a bus pass
I ain't even tripping, I get much cash
Fresh fade, chin hair, and a mustache
I-don I-done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
I.D.G.A.F., I don't give a fuck, no sir
I.D.G.A.F
Balling Jim Jones I didn't came at the night club 10 strong
All of them fine with a pretty face
But main bitch find out I had to get away
Ha, run, run, Mike Epps voice
Ain't feeling that chick, where the next choice?
Where the round town girl? You done got around
Bang, bang, had to shut her down
Big bank roll, still eat MacDonald
First class, worldwide young black stunner
City after city, concert runner
I done took it back to the MJ trunk
Hold up, yes sir!
Better Katy weave, I blow the skirt!
Where you from? Texas home of the best sirs
Sugar honey, ice tea, I'm the S word
I done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I-don I-done came up
I.D.G.A.F., I don't give a fuck
I.D.G.A.F., (to the Styrofoam cups)
I-don I-done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
I.D.G.A.F., I don't give a fuck, no sir
I.D.G.A.F. (ha)
10 grand in a trash bag
Stay so fly get jet lag
Make head bob hard get whip lash
Lil mama bad so I told her to get into the ride
She got ass, no way she beginnin tonight
I took her home and I was hopin to get a massage
With a happy-ending hopin to get a surprise
It's already 4, pull up and party some more
The club want us to leave but we ain't ready to go
Official Ciroc bull I'm just letting ya know
Drank a whole bottle, I swear I done did it before
Indo, outdo; good day (ya)
Bing bank take lil bank
One ounce of cold D, that's lil drank
Spent 25 grand on a fish tank
I done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I-don I-done came up
I.D.G.A.F., I don't give a fuck
I.D.G.A.F., (to the Styrofoam cups)
I-don I-done came up, I done came up
I done came up, I done came up
I.D.G.A.F., I don't give a fuck, no sir
I.D.G.A.F. (ha)
