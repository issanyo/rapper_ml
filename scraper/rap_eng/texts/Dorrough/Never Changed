I can't believe that we done fell off
Some times I sit back and reminisce
'Bout the times we was young
From the times we were smaller
All winters and summers

Now you ain't here when it's sunny
But you was there in the thunder
My nigga just think back to all them
Times we used to kick it

But now we only kick it
Every other blue moon
And a lot of that is my fault
But a lot of that is yo fault

It's all good we both off
Now we don't even talk
Naw, that ain't even how we get down
My nigga, we need to sit down

Shit, every time we hit town to kick it
And visit so everything is ever clear
My nigga, I'm forever here
I don't ever wanna have to hear

You just sittin' down here
Jackin' down here, checkin' down here
Strugglin' down here till you realize
There ain't nothin' down here

And if it's one thing you remember
If nothin' else, bro, I got your back
Big bro, I got your back and that a fact

My nigga, my bro
Whether we rich or we poor
Later on now and before
I just want you to know

This shyt and never changed
This shyt and never changed
This shyt and never changed
Me I'm just happy to know

I could depend on my bro
If I was down on the floor
And had nowhere else to go
This shyt ain't never changed
This shyt ain't never changed

Listen, you my nigga, my bro
Whether we rich or we poor
Later on now and before
And I just want you to know
That I'm just happy to know

I could depend on my bro
If I was down flat on my face
And had nowhere else to go
I could just pick up my phone

If somethin' ever go wrong
My nigga hit me
Till the day we 6 feet
Before the fame before the game
My nigga you was with me

Talkin' to all my niggas
We was riddin' round 6 deep
No homo but this money done
Came between us

My baby girl growin' up
Ain't you and even much seen her
It's funny the savage ways of money
And you and I both know that
Neither of our mommas raised dummies

If they knew we wasn't talkin' like we used to
Or chillin' like we used to
They wouldn't like it much
'Cause seein' us was all they was ever used to

For real but it don't even matter though
'Cause I know that you know
That we know that we both
Ain't got nothin' but love for each other

My nigga, my bro
Whether we rich or we poor
Later on now and before
I just want you to know

This shyt and never changed
This shyt and never changed
This shyt and never changed
Me, I'm just happy to know

I could depend on my bro
If I was down on the floor
And had nowhere else to go
This shyt ain't never changed
This shyt ain't never changed

Before we was chasin' these dollas
Makin' these dollas
And prior take it way back

Take it all the way back
Take it all the way back
Take it all the way back
Take it all the way back

Before we was chasin' this money
Before we was makin' this money
It's funny, take it way back

Take it all the way back
Take it all the way back
Take it all the way back
Take it all the way back

Take it back to before we was ballin'
To before you was hustlin'
Back when we was ballin'
(Hoopin')
Everyday cruisin'

Before we took doves
We spent both our days losin'
Back then it was cool though
Both of use was fools though

Basketball and pullin' hoes
Was all we went to school for
And lookin' back, I'm just happy

I had a partner that would always
Ride for me and looked out for me
Regardless

My nigga, my bro
Whether we rich or we poor
Later on now and before
I just want you to know

This shyt and never changed
This shyt and never changed
This shyt and never changed
Me I'm just happy to know

I could depend on my bro
If I was down on the floor
And had nowhere else to go
This shyt ain't never changed
This shyt ain't never changed
