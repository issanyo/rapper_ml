Ha, yuh, Dorrough music
North side, South side, East Coast
West Coast, Midwest
From my city to yo city
(Dallas, Texas)

From yo hood to my hood
(Say)
Right now, I present to the world
Tomeka Pearl

Put one hand, cross my heart
Want nothing see me apart
From my home where I start
I'm too smart and all I know is

You can take me from my hood
But you can't take my hood from me
I rep my hood, it's understood
Say what 'chu want but all I know is

Say, it's a funny day in the hood
And everybody and they momma out
I must admit today, I'm kinda feeling good
Ain't nobody beefing
And none of my niggas out up in the feds

So the laws ain't gotta be said
'Cause it's understood
And you know the game
It ain't nobody showing love
Unless you gotta name

And don't nobody turn they head
Unless you hoggin' lanes
Ain't nobody breaking bread
Unless you do the same
You know the game boy

Either you ride on heavy Chevy's or gliding
On the Pirellis and sliding
Pulling women to trying
Best believe that we grinding
Getting it where I stay

We getting it every way and safe
Before the end of the day
All the ballers ballin', all the jockers jocking
All the hater's hating, all the boppers bopping
Old lady cool, probably take her shopping
Real G's let me hear it if you feel me knocking

You can take me from my hood
But you can't take my hood from me
I rep my hood it's understood
Say what 'chu want but all I know is

Check me out, I'm holding
Steady like I'm rolling
Riding through yo hood
I chunk the deuce up like I'm posing

Riding through yo city
Rolling gutta like I'm bowling
First I get it live then shut it down
Like it's closing

Early, long wide worly
Kicking one deep 'cause you boys act girly
Or maybe with a sweet big ice cream swirly
Wrist gold neck, gold teeth, white pearly

And you can catch me
Like fish fries on a Saturday
Ya momma looking good
I like the way she work her hunny day

She hopped up in the slab
I say, "What 'cha wanna do today?"
She looked at me and smiled then said
"Boy, I'm doing you today"

Fo' real, I guess that mean
That I'm official now, it took awhile
But now they recognize
I'm on a mission now

Stop, listen I got that full attention now
Since I got attention
It's the perfect time to mission out that

Put one hand, cross my heart
Want nothing see me apart
From my home where I start
I'm too smart and all I know is

You can take me from my hood
But you can't take my hood from me
I rep my hood it's understood
Say what 'chu want but all I know is

It don't really matter much where I be
Never will you find another G like me
You see a lot of people try to be like me
But never will you find another G like me

Man, I'm repping my hood for a long, long time
Never will you find another hood like mine
I hope that people got it understood like mine
'Cause never will you find another hood like mine

Put one hand, cross my heart
Want nothing see me apart
From my home where I start
I'm too smart and all I know is

You can take me from my hood
But you can't take my hood from me
I rep my hood it's understood
Say what 'chu want but all I know is
