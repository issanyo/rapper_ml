Ha, yo, Dorrough Music
North Side, South Side, East Coast, West Coast, Mid-West
From my city to yo' city, Dallas, Texas, from yo hood to my hood
Right now I present to the world Tomeka Pearl

Put one hand cross my heart, won't nothing bring me apart
From my home where I start, I'm too smart and all I know is
You can take me from my hood but you can't take my hood from me
I rep my hood it's understood, say what you want but all I know is

Say, it's a funny day in the hood and everybody and they momma out
I must admit today I'm kinda feeling good
Ain't nobody beefing and none of my niggas out up in the feds
So the laws ain't gotta be said 'cause it's understood

And you know the game
It ain't nobody showing love unless you gotta name
And don't nobody turn they head unless you hoggin' lanes
And ain't nobody breaking bread unless you do the same
You know the game boy

Either you ride on heavy Chevy's or gliding
On the Pirellis and sliding, pulling women to trying
Best believe that we grinding, getting it where I stay
We getting it every way and safe

Before the end of the day all the ballers ballin'
All the jokers joking, all the hater's hatin', all the boppers boppin'
All lady cool, probably take her shopping
Real G's let me hear it if you feel me knocking

You can take me from my hood but you can't take my hood from me
I rep my hood it's understood, say what you want but all I know is
You can take me from my hood but you can't take my hood from me
I rep my hood it's understood, say what you want but all I know is

Check me out, I'm holding steady like I'm rolling
Riding thru yo' hood I chunk the deuce up like I'm posing
Riding thru yo' city rolling gutta like I'm bowling
First I get it live then shut it down like it's closing

Early, long wide worly
Kicking one deep cause you boys act girly
Or maybe with a sweet big ice cream swirly
Wrist gold, neck gold, teeth white pearly

And you can catch me in the hood like fish fries on a Saturday
Ya momma looking good, I like the way she wore her hair today
She hopped up in the slab, I say what you wanna do today?
She looked at me and smiled then said boy, I'm doing you today

For real? I guess that mean that I'm official now
It took awhile but now they recognize I'm on a mission now
Stop, listen I got they full attention now
Since I got attention it's the perfect time to mission out that

You can take me from my hood but you can't take my hood from me
I rep my hood it's understood, say what you want but all I know is
You can take me from my hood but you can't take my hood from me
I rep my hood it's understood, say what you want but all I know is

It don't really matter much where I be
Never will you find another G like me
You see a lot of people try to be like me
But never will you find another G like me

Man, I'm repping my hood for a long, long time
Never will you find another hood like mine
I hope that people got it understood like mine
'Cause never will you find another hood like mine

You can take me from my hood but you can't take my hood from me
I rep my hood it's understood, say what you want but all I know is
You can take me from my hood but you can't take my hood from me
I rep my hood it's understood, say what you want but all I know is
