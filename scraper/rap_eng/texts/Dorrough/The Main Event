[Intro - Chamillionaire - talking]
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
I brought my DJ with me, that mean we goin in
I brought my DJ with me, that mean we goin in

[Hook 1 - Chamillionaire]
I'm the main event, whoa
I'm the main event, whoa
Still grindin in the streets like I ain't made a cent

I'm the main event, whoa
I'm the main event, whoa
Tryin to get it like the money that I made was spent

I'm the main event, whoa
I'm the main event, whoa
Still hustlin like I know it's time to pay the rent

I'm the main event, whoa
I'm the main event, whoa
You're lookin for me, you could find me where the money at

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
The walk in after party, Texas I'm what it is
Exit the bar if you ain't tryin to get your card slid
They ain't no big dogs, they just bark big
But I ain't never seen the damage that a bark did
It's the Chamillionaire, I only trust Ben
I brought some ladies with me, that mean I'm plus ten
I brought my DJ with me, that mean we goin in
I do it big like my jimmy wasn't tucked in
Nuts large, lucky I don't keep my dick exposed
See they the past, I'm the present like some Christmas clothes
Reppin Texas so don't question if I'm tippin fours
The wheels fly, every vehicle is pigeon-toed
Look at the evidence, looks like it's evident
She wanna bone, she look at me like a skeleton
See this the realest that your radio has ever been
I'm in my element, somebody better tell her man

[Hook 2 - Chamillionaire]
I'm the main event, whoa
I'm the main event, whoa
Still grindin in the streets like I ain't made a cent

I'm the main event, I'm the main event
Uh oh, uh oh

[Verse 2 - Paul Wall]
I swear it ain't been the same ever since I got cake
My hustle is high rate, so haters are irate
Every dollar I can make, I'm a get it 'til the day of my wake
I'm on a paper chase for pies, yeah that cookies and cake
And hold it down for my state, talkin down's a mistake
Ride with me or collide with me, you can't change fate
Southside Houston, Texas, where I roam in the streets
And Northside where I sleep (the Northside don't sleep)
If you sleepin on Texas, better wake up quick
Stop bitin our style and get off our dick
All the jealousy need to quit and the hatin should stop
Cause the third coast ain't never gonna flop, I think not partner

[Hook 1]

[Slim Thug talking over the end of the Hook]
I know you don't cuss but I do Cham, ha, ha

[Verse 3 - Slim Thug]
When Thug Boss come out, lights out, show's over
It's "All Eyez On Me" like 'Pac told ya
If you love ya bitch, you better go and cuff her
Cause tonight if I want to, I'm a fuck her
I'm in this bitch, half a mill' worth of jewelry on
Rocks' so big, lookin like a Flinstone (yeah)
'Fit fresher than some Sunday morning breakfast
We gotta do it big, cause bitch we from Texas
Foreign cars, get your foreign hoes on your team
And I don't drink and drive, I just drink and lean
Keep a bank roll longer than a limousine
Boppers beggin me to hit it like a dope fiend
I run the H like it's a motherfuckin marathon
About to break a take, damn Cham, that's the one
I'm in the elevator, top spot, here I come
Rap Barry Bonds, I got the most home runs

[Verse 4 - Dorrough]
Say what? I made 'em change the prin, they thought I came and
Went
But like the Grand Finale nigga, I'm the main event
Still grindin in the streets like I ain't made a cent
Ballin, the commentators say I'm what the game presents
I'm Mister Get It Done, I do it to the T
If you don't know the name, just call me number 23
I keep a quart load of Spring Bling bikini hoes
Yeah it's a 'lac but it's equipped with Lamborghini doors
My engine souped up, I'm in a super ride
Yeah I'm from Texas nigga, everything's supersized
I never rode a horse, never saw a tumbleweed
But I get high of course, I done smoked a ton of weed
Man and my money hard to fold up
Yeah, I'm holdin Texas down but I rep the whole South
Get your tickets early, shows stay sold out
"Dorrough Music", my album off in stores now
