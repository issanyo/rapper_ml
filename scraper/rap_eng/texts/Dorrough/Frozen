I really do this
You can try to do it, but I am the chosen
Walked in the mall, they took pictures of me
Guess they thought I was posin'
Turn off the lights and just look at me, nigga
My body is glowin'
Platinum and diamonds and yellow gold
Everything on me is frozen
My whole body is frozen, my whole body is frozen
I think I'm sick from my neck and my wrist
My whole body is frozen (I got a cold)
My whole body is frozen, my whole body is frozen
Platinum and diamonds and yellow gold
Everything on me is frozen

[Verse 1]
Sub-Zero from Mortal Kombat, cept im black and a little bit colder
All of this jewelry that's on me, I feel like a No Limit Soldier
A hundred percent and legit than a bitch
I don't know what they told ya
I'm really 'bout what I talk about, nigga, I'm not an imposer
All of my bitches are chosen, official Swisher Sweet rollin'
Posted and loaded, I'm floatin' cause what I am smokin' is potent
Hopefully all of this ice will help out cause my pockets are swollen
The police is pullin' me over and my eyes are red, and I hope he don't notice
I am the truth and they know it, hot as a car that is stolen
It's not even dark and I'm glowin'
Six of my bottom teeth golden
I am the type that will borrow your girlfriend and give her back
I'm on some mo' shit
I fuck with Ali the jeweler, and that's why my body is so lit

Everything on me is frozen
My whole body is frozen, my whole body is frozen
I think I'm sick from my neck and my wrist
My whole body is frozen (I got a cold)
My whole body is frozen, my whole body is frozen
Platinum and diamonds and yellow gold
Everything on me is frozen

[Verse 2]
Below 33 degrees Fahrenheit
This weed got me way way up in heaven site
Got Codeine on deck, I need seven Sprites
Stick dick to your bitch every other night
I do what I wanna do, I get whatever I want
You could too if you do it right
Some say that I'm flashy
But I just be splashin' with small jewelry, I don't do heavy ice
Fuck all the procrastination, I think I have run out of patience
I'm runnin' an organization, drop hits and then go on vacation
The bitch talkin' shit, I pull up and I stunt on that bitch
Haha, what a sensation
Got niggas that open up shop
Make the product sell out and then switch the location
To all of my haters, fuck all y'all
Mad cause your bitch in my call log
In the club takin' shots like a ball hog
This grill in my mouth come from Paul Wall
The ones at the bottom shoot slugs to the top
Don't see none of you niggas, y'all all small
Before you start we walking we all crawl
Ain't no need to get mad we can all ball

My whole body is frozen, my whole body is frozen
Platinum and diamonds and yellow gold
Everything on me is frozen
