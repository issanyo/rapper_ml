[Intro:Problem]
Know it's me, young P, stay higher, seller -- you a buyer
Never gon' retire, stay with that fire, burn this bitch up
Fuck you whack niggas, let me turn this bitch up like WHAAT

[Hook: Dorrough Music]
Drank got me slowed up (syrup) - robotic (I'm leaning)
Got a thick bitch with me - she erotic (Goddamn)
Trying to smoke but i need that exotic (uh-huh)
I smell it in the air - Who got it
Who got it (Who got it)
Who got it (I need it)
Who got it (Where is it)
Who got it (Go get it)
Who got it (Who got it)
Who got it (Kush)
I smell it in the air - Who got it

[Verse 1: Problem]
Whaat, where my cake boys
If you're making that money - make, make noise
It ain't a bad bitch that I ain't screwing
And losing one thing that I ain't doing
Niggas better learn it - to be boss, boy you gotta earn it
Just jumping like a frog and I'm blowing on Kermit
High all day - that's the only way to turn it
Heavy weight lifting - big plates, try to curl it - you can't
Kush in each lung - the line and the coupe, I'm pushing each one
Dirty-ass pussies, I'm douching each one
Fat-ass joints, wax mixed in each one (SMOKE BITCH)

[Hook: Dorrough Music]
Drank got me slowed up (syrup) - robotic (I'm leaning)

I smell it in the air - Who got it
Who got it (Who got it)
Who got it (I need it)
Who got it (Where is it)
Who got it (Go get it)
Who got it (Who got it)
Who got it (Kush)
I smell it in the air - Who got it

[Verse 2: Problem]
Blowin strong with an angel
Rich nigga, got crackers on my payroll
It's like my money got wheels, the way the bankroll be
Put that shit out if it ain't O.G
Nigga you a clone, you so wanna be me
Gangster-ass looks, you a wannabe, G
Make your bitch shake it up, drop it down like T-Lee
Watch me hit that shit like I threw a 4-3 motherfucka
In the club I get so unruly
Need Chris like the next Friday movie
I'm it, smoke more of than me then prove it
A Few more puffs, guaranteed you'll lose it - Hella smoke
