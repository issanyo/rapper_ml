[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Let me set the mood right, slow it down, yellow light
Said the party don't start until the moon rise, got a table in the club, full size
I could get you wet and take a nose dive, cool shades, polarised
Tyrna get you high in the solar system, Kid Ink baby, you ain't know him, bitch better get it right
But you ain't got to get in line
Looking like a Playboy bunny, hope you energized
Gon' and take a minute and decide
I ain't thinking 'bout it, I'ma make you mine

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
By the end of the night, we gon' have some fun
Come help me throw these ones in the air, to the lights
By the end of the night I'ma get you high
Puffing on that loud, girl I'ma get you right
By the end of the night I'ma get you right
By the end of the night I'ma get you right
By the end of the night I'ma get you right
By the end of the night I'ma get you right

[Verse 2: Dorrough Music]
I hope 2:35 am ain't too late
Let's go and get a hotel just cause you got a roommate
Girl you gon' wanna tie me down like a shoelace
I'ma beat that like it owe me, today a past due date
I'ma have you right by the end of the night
Ménage à trois with any friend you invite
Just make that pussy pop like it's a can full of Sprite
And take a couple hits whenever I hand you the pipe, get it?
Pretty face, thin waist with a fat ass
Cali based, London graced and you stack cash
Even though I ain't headed, I want it that bad
We gon' both be like "Satisfaction at last"
Ha, so when you see my number pop up
That mean I'm standing outside the door and I'm rocked up
Don't worry 'bout the rubbers, girl I'm stocked up
And only time gon' stop us

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
By the end of the night, we gon' have some fun
Come help me throw these ones in the air, to the lights
By the end of the night I'ma get you high
Puffing on that loud, girl I'ma get you right
By the end of the night I'ma get you right
By the end of the night I'ma get you right
By the end of the night I'ma get you right
By the end of the night I'ma get you right

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
Girl it's getting late, it's yo last call
Been waiting all night to take yo heels off
Meet me at valet, follow back home
Bring a couple friends, you ain't gotta come alone
We gon have a party
Later I'ma make you call me daddy like Maury
Run my fingers down yo body like a guitarist
Got me hook, chorus
Why you bullshitting like a Taurus?

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
By the end of the night, we gon' have some fun
Come help me throw these ones in the air, to the lights
By the end of the night I'ma get you high
Puffing on that loud, girl I'ma get you right
By the end of the night I'ma get you right
By the end of the night I'ma get you right
By the end of the night I'ma get you right
By the end of the night I'ma get you right
