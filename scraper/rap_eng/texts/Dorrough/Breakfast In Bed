(feat. Ray J)
[Dorrough:]
We bout to try something different like...

[Chorus: Ray J]
Breakfast in Bed (Breakfast in Bed)
Special, you'll like (Special, you'll like)
Sex on the Side (Sex on the Side)
Serve it all night (Serve it all night)
Breakfast in Bed (Breakfast in...) [x4]
Shawty tell me what you think about Breakfast in my Bed

[Verse 1: Dorrough]
Say... See I hate to be a show out
But ain't ya body more out
From last night I made you bust it open like Blow out
But now I'm bout the menu
All I need is me n' you
I'll be the customer, and you can be the menu
Bur better yet the underwear around, I'll cater
I ain't the best cook but I'll serve you like a waiter
Anything you want and all you gotta do is try girl
I ain't got bacon, but I sure got sausage
When's the last time you woke up early gettin served
No alarm clock, just the bees and the birds
Lick your body up with maple syrup
You don't believe the hype but it's everything you heard
Real... Like room service and tele girl
I'm a jam you up, and feel your belly girl
Wear the air shades, you got the jelly girl
We all set to go
I hope you ready for...

[Chorus: Ray J]
Breakfast in Bed (Breakfast in Bed)
Special, you'll like (Special, you'll like)
Sex on the Side (Sex on the Side)
Serve it all night (Serve it all night)
Breakfast in Bed (Breakfast in...) [x4]
Shawty tell me what you think about Breakfast in my Bed

[Verse 2: Dorrough]
Say... From the club, to the Jag, to the crib, to the bedroom
Never thought the night would end with breakfast in the bedroom
When we left the bar
Coulda did it in the car
But don't forget I'm 6' 2"
That mean I need a lotta leg room
Rich body, Own money
Everything a man want
Keep me on the side
I'll do everything ya man won't
If he do it, I'm a do way better than
Anybody, Anywhere; can't compare me to any man
He be close to a minute man
I'll make it happen
You steady givin me orders
I'm steady servin you breakfast
Any way you want it
Best believe you can have it
Hell of an opportunity
I can make it a habit
And all I want from you is permission to be your captain
I can put you in position and show you why I'm the captain
Makes it sound like I'm cocky
I'm the best around, hands down
I guarantee you agree this man will be the best now

[Chorus: Ray J]
Breakfast in Bed (Breakfast in Bed)
Special, you'll like (Special, you'll like)
Sex on the Side (Sex on the Side)
Serve it all night (Serve it all night)
Breakfast in Bed (Breakfast in...) [x4]
Shawty tell me what you think about Breakfast in my Bed

[Verse 3: Dorrough and Ray J]
