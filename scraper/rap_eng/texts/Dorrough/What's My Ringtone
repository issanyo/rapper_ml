Ha yeah, Dorrough Music, say girl, I'm so serious right now
And if I could sing to you, I'll sing to you, ya feel me?

I'm the one you call boo, you the one I call boo
I know you hear that special song every time I call you
Whenever passion seems gone I'm the one you lean on
Ooh, I know I'm special, girl, so tell me what's my ringtone

I love it when you call me whenever you can call me
I always hear that special song every time you call me
Whenever passion seems gone you the one I lean on
Ooh, you know you special boy, that's why you got this ringtone

Now say, every girl got a special tone
For they boo when they call they phone
I ain't tryin' to ask 21 questions
All I'm tryin' to figure out is what's my song

Is it 'Love' by Keyshia Cole or 'Playa Cardz' by Keyshia Cole?
And all I know is it better not be 'I should've Cheated' by Keyshia Cole

Could it be 'I Need You Back' 'cause girl, I hope you need me back
I bet you change my song like 'Bust Your Windows Out'
Whenever I make you mad if you feel like you need time
To find that special ringtone it's all for me it's cool
'Cause I ain't even trippin' girl, 'cause all I know is

I'm the one you call boo, you the one I call boo
I know you hear that special song every time I call you
Whenever passion seems gone I'm the one you lean on
Ooh, I know I'm special girl, so tell me what's my ringtone

I love it when you call me whenever you can call me
I always hear that special song every time you call me
Whenever passion seems gone, you the one I lean on
Ooh, you know you special boy, that's why you got this ringtone

Now girl, you know I 'Birthday Sex' that's your ringtone
Your picture is my screensaver, the one where you got them jeans on
See girl you all over my phone and everyday I'll change your song
Yesterday 'Miss Independent', today 'She Got Her Own'

My boo for me she carry love song by Mariah Carey
Ooh, girl you so damn fine, yo ringtone is Halle Berry
Just want you to know I feel you, so ringtone love I give you
But this song right here is my ringback, girl, you so special

I will send you a ringtone but girl, I can't sing
So just let it ring, girl, just let it ring
And all I wanna know is if I gotta special song
So tell me what's my ringtone? Tell me, tell me what's my ringtone?

Boy, I still love you even though you can't sing
Now just let it ring, I'ma just let it ring
Don't worry about the phone, just know that you got a special song
So tell me what's my ringtone? Tell me, tell me what's my ringtone?

If you that special somebody let me hear you say I got me a ringtone
If you that special somebody let me hear you say I got me a ringtone
If you ain't got you nobody let me hear you say I don't need a ringtone
If you ain't got you nobody let me hear you say I don't need a ringtone

But if you got you a boo then girl you say I got me a ringtone
Yeah, if you got you a boo then girl you say I got me a ringtone
If you ain't got you no boo that's cool, just say I don't need a ringtone
If you ain't got you no boo that's cool Just say I don't need a ringtone

I'm the one you call boo, you the one I call boo

Whenever passion seems gone you the one I lean on
Ooh, you know you special boy, that's why you got this ringtone
