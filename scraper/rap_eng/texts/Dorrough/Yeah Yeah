I like my money up front, yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'mma give you what you paid for, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Six 3, yeah I'm back again, yeah yeah yeah yeah

I like 'em cute, slim, thick, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Look like a fucking fitness model, yeah yeah yeah yeah
You can throw away my cup, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Cause I like drinking out the bottle, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
And I'm just celebrating life without the bullshit
I'm just celebrating life without the bullshit
And I can tell by the way we move that we are not the same
I see the fake shit really winning and it's driving me insane
But now the game about to change, I'ma be the one to blame
Once I expose 'em to the real, they ain't gon' look at shit the same
Lately, I've been getting wasted
I come from a struggle, but I never let it break me
Out here making money, but I never let it make me
I can do this daily, do it with me baby

[Hook]
I like 'em cute, slim, thick, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Look like a fucking fitness model, yeah yeah yeah yeah
You can throw away my cup, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Cause I like drinking out the bottle, yeah yeah yeah yeah
I like my weed past loud, yeah yeah yeah yeah
You can smell it when you walk in, yeah yeah yeah yeah
She been begging for the dick, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hit it once, now she back again, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I don't take nothing for granted cause nothing for me was granted
Official, I'm so organic, you niggas don't understand it
Smoking on something exotic, that come straight out of the planet
I like my women authentic, black, white, Asian and Hispanic
Is this your girl? That always texting me and calling my phone
Is this your girl? That I don fucked, now she won't leave me alone
Come get your girl, she really feeling me
But I ain't got that type of time for her, she killing me
This shit is a lock out, that mean I ain't playing no games
Gimme my money, ain't shit to talk about, I don't do this shit for no fame
Can't associate with no fuck shit cause I don't want it attached to my name
All my people on the same thing, trill shit campaign

[Hook]
I like 'em cute, slim, thick, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Look like a fucking fitness model, yeah yeah yeah yeah
You can throw away my cup, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Cause I like drinking out the bottle, yeah yeah yeah yeah
I like my weed past loud, yeah yeah yeah yeah
You can smell it when you walk in, yeah yeah yeah yeah
She been begging for the dick, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hit it once, now she back again, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Outro]
And I'm just celebrating life without the bullshit
I'm just celebrating life without the bullshit
