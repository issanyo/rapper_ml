[Intro]
Mustard on that beat, hoe

[Verse 1: Bounce]
My wrist super dumb, neck super dumb
Whip sip it up, hoes on my nuts
Bottles get to poppin', scared niggas duck
Haters wanna try me, pussy, try your luck
Mustard on the beat, got these hoes geeked
Smokin' while I'm ballin', Jordans on my feet
Fuckin' bad bitches, bend her on the sink
Told a bitch to give me brain, show me what you think
Man, my waste thick, man, these hoes freaks
Niggas cunny ballin', money don't shrink
Take her out to eat, make the whole treat
If she tryna fuck the team, kick her off the team
Bottles get to flyin' like pigeons, we gettin' wasted
Lightskin nigga with dress, they think I'm Haitian
Fuck clear, all we drink is the dark, they think I'm racist
Steno gang bitch, we shittin', my nigga face it

[Hook: Bounce]
Her ass super dumb, my wrist super dumb
My whip super dumb, my club super dumb
Loud roll it up, bitches pullin' up
Throwin' money in the air, bands goin' up (up, up, up, up)
Throwin' money in the air, bands goin' up (up, up, up, up)
We the "make it rain" gang, hoes on our nuts

[Verse 2: Dorrough]
H-hoes on my nuts
It's like everywhere I go, hoes wanna fuck
Gots me showin' kinda slow, pour it in the cup
I'm from the South, when I ride, those going up (whoo)
Texan nigga smokin' on some California (cookies)
And Colorado sippin' on the Arizona (what kind?)
Green tea, with a bad bitch
Straight gettin' these hoes like catfish
24/7, gettin' this money
Twenties and tens, fifties and hunnids
BDC be the clique and my city, we run it
The cops be pullin' us over, we be excessively stuntin'
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em bad bitches go to Diddy's
Throwin' money in the air, I got plenty
My watch and my ring worth a Bentley
Been ballin' for a minute, my girl feelin' hot

[Hook: Bounce]
Her ass super dumb, my wrist super dumb
My whip super dumb, my club super dumb
Loud roll it up, bitches pullin' up
Throwin' money in the air, bands goin' up (up, up, up, up)
Throwin' money in the air, bands goin' up (up, up, up, up)
We the "make it rain" gang, hoes on our nuts

[Refrain: Bounce]
Up, up, up, up
Throwin' money in the air, bands goin' up
Up, up, up, up
We the "make it rain" gang, hoes on our nuts
Up, up, up, up
Throwin' money in the air, bands goin' up
Up, up, up, up
We the "make it rain" gang, hoes on our nuts

[Hook: Bounce]
Her ass super dumb, my wrist super dumb
My whip super dumb, my club super dumb
Loud roll it up, bitches pullin' up
Throwin' money in the air, bands goin' up (up, up, up, up)
Throwin' money in the air, bands goin' up (up, up, up, up)
We the "make it rain" gang, hoes on our nuts
