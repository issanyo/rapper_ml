[Hook:]
I'm on that
La la la
Counting my money, saying
La la la
Laughing at the haters like
La la la
We do it every day like
We do it every day like
We do it every day like
Break it down, roll it up, lighters up, lighting up
Break it down, roll it up, lighters up, lighting up
Break it down (break it down)
Roll it up (roll it up)
Lighters up (lighters up)
Now lighting up (lighting up)


[Verse 1]

I’ll be on that Cally Kush
I won’t smoke that Reggie Bush
Even though I rush out through these willows like I’m Reggie Bush!
Cloud mind, always take the fights, I’m steady bull
I’m head baked, left a million trying to get some Kush
I go around the world me and my local homies
I turn up like I got remote controllers on me!
Got cheese and bread, all I need is pepperoni
All my bitches bad, don’t need no testimony!
Aces of spades, I’m a renegade!
I don’t call the foe, I fill my lemonade
Hawain punch a spider in its Minutemaid
Pour it up and drink it like it’s Gatoraid!


[Bridge]
I stay high
This OG Kush got me believing I can fly
All around the world, They blow on
La la la la la
Everywhere we go, we’re on that
Every race I know, be on that
Roll up and blow I’m on that


[Hook]

Break it down, roll it up, lighters up, lighting up
Break it down, roll it up, lighters up, lighting up
Break it down (break it down)
Roll it up (roll it up)
Lighters up (lighters up)
Now lighting up (lighting up)


[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]

Break it down, roll a pound, blow it up!
I got a call from my dwag, said it’s going up!
Said if you got some KK, best believe I’m showing up!
And if the sign say no smoking, now I don’t give a fuck
This is what you call out one percent
Cause 99 of the other is fake!
Real cookies, not the ones that you bake
Smoking one and got one on the way
Am I new… like Bob Marley was wake
You understand me?

[Bridge - Wiz Khalifa]
I'm always high, I'm never on the ground I'm somewhere in the sky
Not R.Kelly but I believe that I can Fly
And all my niggas screaming
Taylor Gang or Die
Floating away cause I’m on that

[Verse 3]

I’m on this text till you know what’s up (know what’s up)
That mean I got that drink up in my cup (in my cup)
And everywhere we go we fire up (we fire up)
We stay wet and heated like a fucking firetruck
Ha, I’m super hot, chain full of “whats”
I bet I got more diamonds that your jeweler got!
You know we’re smoking louder make you choke a lot
And every time we choke, we make you take a shot!

[Bridge]
I stay high
This OG Kush got me believing I can fly
All around the world, They blow on
La la la la la
Everywhere we go, we’re on that
Every race I know, be on that
Roll up and blow I’m on that
