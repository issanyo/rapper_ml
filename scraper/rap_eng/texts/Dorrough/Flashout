Hit the mall with my cash out
Ima bout to flash out
New school swag
And they just let class out
Hit the club brand new
Clothes with the tags out
Ball till I pass out

Repeat chorus

Body sprayin tagged out
This a new hit send the email blast out
Fresh faded up so today

Screens on the dash out

All my niggas gettin bitches
The hood like a bitch with a quick whip

Droppin off some Jordan that I just brought up from berlin
Ain't gotta make it rain if I want I could make it whirlwind
And have these niggas mad cuz im entertaining their girlfriend
Yeaaa my clothes my ride hater close your eyes when I ride
They hate to see me this fly

Stripes mean im goin fast

All yellow DC?s teachers call it lemonade
Sharpin than a barber blade
