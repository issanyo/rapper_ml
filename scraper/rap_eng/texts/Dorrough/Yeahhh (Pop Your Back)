[Intro]
Brr
Cookin' Soul
It's Gucci
I'm Mr. Zone 6, what hatnin'?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I ain't bullshittin'
Gucci bout his business
Twelve tryin' catch me they got me jumpin' fences
Loose chain comin' in as eighteen inches
Fifteen five blunt gettin' with the quickness
I'm no lawyer I'm no doctor
Gucci Mane a mobster, I smoke it like a robster
Pounds like Gotham, feels like pasta
Iced out, lookin' made your girlfriend jockin'
Somebody stop him, somebody get him
He crazy as a fool and he got them goons with him
Somebody stop him, somebody get him
He crazy as a fool and he got them goons with him

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Three girls with me, three girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back
Booty girls with me, booty girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back
Booty girls with me, booty girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back
Booty girls with me, booty girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back

[Verse 2: Blanco]
I don't need to brag, my swag do the talkin'
I don't need the Jag', I just bought because I was shoppin'
I was feelin' kind of bored, like fuck it, I'll cop it
I brought a duffle bag just instead it was a problem
Yeah, I cashed out, then I smashed out
There's bad bitches at the crib, all passed out
And they waitin' on me and y'all hatin' on me
I smell the success, the ho said they taste it on me
Yeah, I'm a triple OG
Like I smoke a lotta weed, make you sip a lil' lean
See, I'm every ho's dream and a dude's worst nightmare
Movin' hoes out, it's the truth, I swear

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Three girls with me, three girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back
Booty girls with me, booty girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back
Booty girls with me, booty girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back
Booty girls with me, booty girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back

[Verse 3: Dorrough & Gucci Mane]
I'm in the club, lookin' good, bitches like me
I ain't gotta dress, I could wear a white tee
Hoes boppin' 'cause they see me with my chain on
I'm a G, I ain't gotta run game
'Cause bitch I'm gettin' paid, I pop collars
Signed independent, gettin' independent dollars
Makin' independent moves, yes I do
Lil' mama got friends, tell 'em bring them too
We could all make love, all make love
Liquor in my body as I'm walkin' through the club
I think I see a cutie, lookin' like she up-to-par
Girl, male cookie bar
Said she want a superstar
You could flip it better here, go make a DO double R
On a long-ass dick, I could hit her from afar
Better watch out, I'll hook your chick
If the bitch got friends, I'll fuck her clique
I'll make 'em say "yeah"
Yeah, brr
Yeah, yeah, yeah, brr
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Three girls with me, three girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back, pop your back
Booty girls with me, booty girls with me
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop your back
