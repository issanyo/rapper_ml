If this is the love that the old folks choose to warn me about
Then baby girl I’m in trouble, I’m in real big trouble
If this is the love that the old folks choose to warn me about
Then baby girl I’m in trouble, I’m in real big, I’m in real big, I’m in real big trouble
To the day death do us apart, I fell in love with the game and gave away my heart
See I ain’t talking about the way a man love a woman
I’m talking about the hater struggle in the love for money
My nerves expand, … I wake up out my sleep jumping
Suspiciously feeling that niggers probably up to something
Consistently dealing with niggers changing all the sudden
Niggers ride by you shit don’t say what’s up or nothing
Your main bitch be acting funny when your money lonely
And when you’re starving, it ain’t hard to become money hungry
The game will turn your to a everyday valentine
I know you mean well and plan to get you family time
And before you know it you gonn’ hussle through your whole week
Your cash right and you ain’t worried about the lack of sleep
The unexpected cases taken back to story point
You don’t … just to get the score I want
Man you feel like
If this is the love that the old folks choose to warn me about
Then baby girl I’m in trouble, I’m in real big trouble
If this is the love that the old folks choose to warn me about
Then baby girl I’m in trouble, I’m in real big, I’m in real big, I’m in real big trouble
The game I had to admit, even sometimes afraid
The game I had you confused like you inside of a maze
The … steady changing your ways
I had you borrowing money just for a couple of days
And days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months
And months turn into stunts, now niggers riding with punks
You know you mean what you said, but to them you put on a front
And now they see you as trash, and they bout ready to dump
You out here trying to provide, sacrificing your pride
You ain’t looking for problems, you just trying to survive
Seems like it’s easy to run, but it ain’t easy to hide
Niggers will rob you blind until you open your eyes
You get addicted to money, you love it like it’s a woman
You see the shit you did been through, but you don’t see what be coming
You know ain’t nothing promised, … your future
But it’s better to hussle boy, then to turn to a …
But you feel like
If this is the love that the old folks choose to warn me about
Then baby girl I’m in trouble, I’m in real big trouble
If this is the love that the old folks choose to warn me about
Then baby girl I’m in trouble, I’m in real big, I’m in real big, I’m in real big trouble
I’d rather get with everybody, everybody
Then I do so wrong to everybody, everybody, everybody
So I made this song for everybody, everybody, everybody X 2
But all I’m trying to do is … and I’ve been through
Sometimes you’d rather rediscover what’s within you
So out my grinders and my husslers I command you
Cause they don’t understand the struggle that we’ve been through
And they don’t understand that we just wanna win too
But all they do is feed us troubles…
And that’s why I feel like
If this is the love that the old folks choose to warn me about
Then baby girl I’m in trouble, I’m in real big trouble
If this is the love that the old folks choose to warn me about
Then baby girl I’m in trouble, I’m in real big, I’m in real big, I’m in real big trouble
