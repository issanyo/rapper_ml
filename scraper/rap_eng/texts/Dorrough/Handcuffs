[feat. Slim Thug]
... spending cash
She was big far six with an ass
And all I wanted was to hit her with the...
You're from... to her down
Bottom of line she was bad to the bone
If a nigga think he will hit her crown
Cause I took her to my... true story
All I want is to hit her up and...
It was nothing to it
Now I can't believe that a nigga put his trust into her
All the game she's running you don't even know she's bluffing you
You don't even know her type of bitch you had he cuffing, did you?
You can't be locking up these hores man, nigga
You might as well tell these bitches come out with their hands up
She can't even be faithful and you got these bitches handcuff?
You ain't nothing but a joke

[Chorus:]
That bitch ain't yours
... cause the bitch got curves
You got a bitch with a body like hers
Stop... handcuff
Me you and even your bro
Man why you're cuffing these hores
I don't know could be me...
I think your girl is calling me again
I keep her pussy popping like a rubber...
She told me that you ain't nothing but a friend
... she had a line
But you're the one who's looking stupid
Cause every other night I give her the...
My nigga she's using a dummy anyway...
She's kissing you in the mouth right after sucking my dick
She's got you all heat it up thought you made it the world
Don't be mad at yourself don't be mad at your girl
She's like everything she told me
She personally knows me
While you've been out and cuffing... the police
... been together at least that's what she told me
I ain't even try to... she personally chose me

[Chorus]
Mister... take the cuffs off of her
She don't wanna be saved
She said you were stocking her
All up in the phone...
Who is this?
Now let your act stop
Acting like a bitch
I try to make a wify
I dick her down nightly
I beat it her so much
That her pussy don't excite me
Tell me how you lick her same night...
She's looking at you like a...
Holdin hands, boy that ain't cool
... high school
She's doing her back good
I guess she couldn't take it
... bitch naked
... you stay you still love her
Hoping she will change
But she belongs to the public
She ain't none of yours man

[Chorus]
