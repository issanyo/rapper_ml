She can walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk

Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk

She look good in her clothes, head to her toes
Primetime chick, she the type to get chose
Baby girl so fine, she make a nigga wanna shout
Style so hood, I wanna see what she about

She walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk

Goddamn, she a sassy
Face, body, ass, yeah, she got the total package
Walking through the club like a nigga ain't watchin'
Struttin' that strut like she in a mall shoppin'

Can't forget the mention, yeah, she got the mansions
I wonder if she know that she the center of attention
Middle of the floor, doing her, looking sexy
She can walk that walk, like the niggas do at weddings

She the type you wanna marry, top notch and classy
Niggas lined up trying to be her baby daddy
Excuse me, what's your name? How you doing? I'm just askin'
Can I take you by the hand? Baby, I'll be gladly

Damn, I want her bad, so I'mma come at her politely
By the way she flirtin', I can tell it that she like me
Way across the floor, but looking at me while she dancing
That sexy ass can be, lil' mama, you ain't understandin'

She look good in her clothes, head to her toes
Primetime chick, she the type to get chose
Baby girl so fine, she make a nigga wanna shout
Style so hood, I wanna see what she about

She walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk

She got Beyonce hips, Keishya Cole thighs
Meagan Good lips and some sexy-ass eyes
She yellow like the road in the Wizard of the Oz
Got them other bitches hatin', talkin' like Plies

Say it then she go fed
Then she taste up from her toes to her head
Take her out to eat before I take her to the bed
And give her that uhh, uhh and I don't need no meds

All I need is her, thirty minutes and a rubber
Nigga like me, you'll find none other
Straight beast mode, three times, one hour
Give it to her, in the kitchen, bedroom or the shower

Lil' talk, I got what she need
Head board knockin' up against her knees
Hit her from the back so I can grab her by the waist
Flip her over then you all on her face

She look good in her clothes, head to her toes
Primetime chick, she the type to get chose
Baby girl so fine, she make a nigga wanna shout
Style so hood, I wanna see what she about

She walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk

She can walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk

Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk
