I told them hoes I'm taken
I guess they thought that I was playing
But I don't know what is you saying
But girl bad as fuck and she be slaying, oh yeah
Slaying, slaying, slaying, slaying
Slaying, my bitch be slaying, my bitch be slaying, my bitch be slaying

[Verse 1: Dorrough Music]
I love me a girl that stay fine and can handle her business
Can you do it while you holding me down?
Staying focused, I'm loving herself, getting money and fitness
And I gotta have a girl again
Go to another level, that's what we doing tonight
You just can't talk about it, you gotta do it right
When you got something special, you just can't let it go
These hoes be hating on her, I have to let 'em know
None of you bitches got nothing at all on my baby
A whole 'noter level we on
You think I'mma leave her for you, oh no, you bitches crazy
I gotta let 'em know

[Hook: TK-N-CA$H]
I told them hoes I'm taken
I guess they thought that I was playing
But I don't know what is you saying
But girl bad as fuck and she be slaying, oh yeah
Slaying, slaying, slaying, slaying
Slaying, my bitch be slaying, my bitch be slaying, my bitch be slaying

[Verse 2: TK-N-CA$H]
Bitch bad and she know it, Instagram ain't gotta show it
Ass fat, yeah it's swollen, I really know something
I ain't even gotta say it, bitch bad and she slaying
All your hoes be playing, and my baby be slaying
She know I'mma bring the money back
Stay down 'til I BoFlex
And if I call, she gon' answer that
And gon' always keep it real with me
She gon' get it just the trill with me
She the only one that deal with me
And that's why she gon' see that mill with me

[Hook: TK-N-CA$H]
