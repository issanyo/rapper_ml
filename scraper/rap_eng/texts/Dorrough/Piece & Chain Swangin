They say, Thugga, why the call you the boss?
I say 'cause my piece cost mo' than your hoes
My chain worth more than that new car you bought
Don't be mad at me mayne, it ain't' my fault

But the lightin' 'cause a rainbow colorition'
I'm addicted in specific in the moment I go ballistic
If I like it I'ma get it, like it I'ma get it

From the whites to the rain, shinin' so insane
When the light hit that thang is when they know I ain't playin'
So, if you get on your grind instead of hatin' you can get the same
So don't complain 'cause what I'm sayin' is
