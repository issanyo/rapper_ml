[Intro:]
Ahh Ahh, Yeah Yeah
Ahh Ahh, Yeah Yeah
Ahh Ahh, Yeah Yeah
Ah Ah, Yea Yea
Ah Yea Ah Yeah

[Chorus:]
I'm in the zone
My whole team on
I walk in and the DJ play mah theme song
Oohh, lil mama with them jean on
Lookin good and she got me in the club like
Ahh Ahh, Yeah Yeah
Ah Ah, Yea Yea
Ah Yea Ah Yeah

[Verse 1:]
Say... it's Mr. Primetime lookin for a Primetime freak
I spy a cutie with some Primetime cheeks
Boy you better get before lil mama find me
Cause when I get her I'm a hit her with this #9 piece
Eye candy, she turnin head so errybody
I ain't trippin, there's 'nuff women for errybody
See I don't cuff hoes, and I don't cockblock
I'm in the club makin thick chicks pop, lock
I live the fast life, can't do the slow action
I stay with only tender roni that I know packin
Be a freak, she stay Mrs. Grant in my Bo Jackson's
Can't have an amateur, I need a pro that can
Bounce... Bounce... Bounce that ass for me
It's all but is you into breakin cash for me
3-point straight bust down trick
Now say hush, straight touchdown bitch

[Chorus:]
I'm in the zone
My whole team on
I walk in and the DJ play mah theme song
Oohh, lil mama with them jean on
Lookin good and she got me in the club like
Ahh Ahh, Yeah Yeah
Ah Ah, Yea Yea
Ah Yea Ah Yeah

[Verse 2:]
Get it, Gotta go and get some mo'
I spy a cutie, play this song and watchem hit the floo
She about to VIP with no idea I'm bout to hit the dro
We treat the herb like it's money cause we bout to blow
Hundreds... Fifties... Bad chicks with me
Now we wilin out, we spent a couple stacks quickly
Drink with me I guarantee you leave this bitch tipsy
Bounce on the track, make ya move ya body swiftly
Baby got back... hips... thighs
Baby got that
Shout out to the women that say they got stacks
Hair ain't real, it's ok they got tracks
Real hair, Fake hair, look good
They start handlin their business
Handle business like a day care
You ain't got her money she probably will play for a top notch chick
And she say she goin stay there

[Bridge:]
Say girl, bout damn time
All night drivin me out my mind
Girl do you thang, you too damn fine
Drop that thang for me one more time
Say girl one more time
Say girl one more time
Say girl one more time
Drop that thang for me one more time

[Chorus:]
I'm in the zone
My whole team on
I walk in and the DJ play mah theme song
Oohh, lil mama with them jean on
Lookin good and she got me in the club like
Ahh Ahh, Yeah Yeah
Ah Ah, Yea Yea
Ah Yea Ah Yeah
