She ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
Is something wrong with her 'cause she ain't got it all
She ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
She on some other shit 'cause she ain't got it all

She ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
Somebody get this girl 'cause she ain't got it all
She ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
I don't want it with this girl 'cause she ain't got it all

See, she ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
All you crazy hoe, I know a lot of y'all
I had this one girl, she had a body, dawg
Pretty in the face just like a Barbie doll

I met her in the club, she was hot and all
At first I really liked her but later not at all
I took her to the crib and she was naughty, dawg
She took me to the head just like a Tylenol

She sees my piece and chain, she see my diamond ring
That's what the problem is, she feel I got it all
See, I done met the game but see, I play the game
So I'ma call the clique and toss her like a volleyball

She ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
Is something wrong with her 'cause she ain't got it all
She ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
She on some other shit 'cause she ain't got it all

She ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
Somebody get this girl 'cause she ain't got it all
She ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
I don't want it with this girl 'cause she ain't got it all

Say, now she callin' me and she keep on callin' me
I'm not a toilet bowl, so why she stallin' me?
She crazy in the head, oh yeah, she gotta be
And then she be at all my shows, I think she followin' me

Now I don't bother her, so why she botherin' me
She see me ballin' so she tryna win a lottery
She stay around 'cause she know I be where them dollars be
But I wouldn't spend a dollar on her in a dollar tree

I know you think I'm mean, well, I don't try to be
So suck it up 'cause see, Dorrough don't do apologies
She asked am I a G, I tell her possibly
But if a G is what she want then I don't try to be

She ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
Is something wrong with her 'cause she ain't got it all
She ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
She on some other shit 'cause she ain't got it all

She ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
Somebody get this girl 'cause she ain't got it all
She ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
I don't want it with this girl 'cause she ain't got it all

Look, I done took her to Benny Hana's then I took her to the game
Black off sets on a peanut butter range
Whole purple sets plus I'm leaning on that drank
I used to make it rain, now I make it hurricane

That was her name, she was bad and she had a great job
I ain't gone lie, she the reason why I got 8 car
She hustle for her daddy and her daddy me
You wanna date with her, this gone cost you a B

I'm on them hoe, I'm sitting low
I'm doin' this for pimp screw and Big Moe
This Flip and Dorrough, he keep shit like here
And baby girl, these some gators, my watch your step

She ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
Is something wrong with her 'cause she ain't got it all
She ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
She on some other shit 'cause she ain't got it all

She ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
Somebody get this girl 'cause she ain't got it all
She ain't got it all, she ain't got it all
I don't want it with this girl 'cause she ain't got it all
