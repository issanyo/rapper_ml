[Intro: BeatKing speaking]

[Hook: BeatKing]
What that mouth do? (x6)
If that mouth don't do nothing I can't fuck with you
Is it sloppy, is it sloppy
Are you shy?
Is this your first time, am I your first guy?
What that mouth do? (x4)

[Verse 1: BeatKing]
I don't want that pussy bitch
Before you suck my dick pull out them titties, bitch go off
I just want the head, get the bread, than I leave
When I'm off the nut can you go faster please?
All these bitches sucking dick, don't let these bitches lie
Get her on the liquor then she deep-throat, surprise
What that mouth do is all what on a niggas mind
And that mouth may do alotta shit but it will never kiss mine

[Bridge: BeatKing]
All I wanna know is what that mouth do
All I wanna know is can you put on me

[Hook: BeatKing]

[Verse 2: Dorrough Music]
Keep it real with you I don't even want the pussy
Head is all I wanted, bet you be not a rookie
Up and down move that neck bitch that's a exercise
Do it right and you just might get yourself a neck massage
[?], Texas side bitch I'm all of that
Just know that head weak if it don't got me calling back
Suck my dick bitch, I want 30 minutes
And I don't give a fuck about you, we [?] independent
