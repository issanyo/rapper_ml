Intro:
Yeah, Ha
Yo its the D-O Double R (Yes Sir)
Dorrough Music (Yeah Buddy)
PrimeTime Clique, Bitch

Chorus:
Boy I Grind (like Boy I, Boy I)
Boy I Grind (like Boy I, Boy I)
Boy I Grind (like Boy I, Boy I)
Boy I Grind like there ain't no tomorrow

Verse 1:
Say, I heard there's a fire, fire, somebody yell fire
So damn fly that niggas put me on they flyers
Prior, and no i'm no liar
I'm grinding like i'm riding on four flat tires

Book me for a show, I'll work, for hire
Book me for a show, big faces I require
Cause boy I'm fire, sizzlin, cracklin
Plus I grind like two hoes wrestlin'

Quick to spit verses like reverends
Grind like [?]
25/8 Fuck 24/7
When do I sleep, really ain't no tellin'
I'm the 411 like April, 11th

Yeah I'm from the south
Where niggas get street money
Im from the south
Where niggas get deep money
Im from the south
We get money, keep money
Long money, speak money, take you out to eat money

Chorus:X2
Boy I Grind (like Boy I, Boy I)
Boy I Grind (like Boy I, Boy I)
Boy I Grind (like Boy I, Boy I)
Boy I Grind like there ain't no tomorrow

Verse 2:
Boy I grind like a skater, I grind for the paper
Ride around in 20-29 navigators
Lil mama fine but I ain't time to just date her
She mad cuz Im a dog, and I dont even know her maker

Taking risks like a knife spinning [?]
Where niggas who step pour papers
And all i know is hustlers, ballers, and haters

And most of you niggas played out like [?]

Got me yellin faker, faker, my nigga youz a faker
[????]
Watch, you better hope yo bitch dont break ya
Heres a tip do not go where the money dont take ya

Jelousy, I ain't trippen because I get money and got money
And I ain't trippen because I stacked up and stocked money
And some people called the country boy a crop money
Big money, shop money, buy it off the lot money

Chorus:X2
Boy I Grind (like Boy I, Boy I)
Boy I Grind (like Boy I, Boy I)
Boy I Grind (like Boy I, Boy I)
Boy I Grind like there ain't no tomorrow

Verse 3:
If you get cold, I get hotter
Where ever I go yo bitch gunna follow
Yeah boy yo bitch my pinta
Beat that pussy just like pintas

As I get hot, you get colder
I stack paper like 5 star folders
Put cho bitch legs over my shoulder
Beat that pussy just like I suppose to

Lou, ash a poo, make it pop like mountain dew
Stand tall like mountain dew
Make a million then count a few

(Boy I grind, like boy I, boy I)

And really on that bull shit
But i got through to the hound of you
Dope niggas get dope money, show niggas get show money
Pimp niggas get hoe money, grown niggas get no money

One man can get a lot of money
But more niggas get more money
I cry without a 95
I fuck around and get cho money

Chorus:X2
Boy I Grind (like Boy I, Boy I)
Boy I Grind (like Boy I, Boy I)
Boy I Grind (like Boy I, Boy I)
Boy I Grind like there ain't no tomorrow
