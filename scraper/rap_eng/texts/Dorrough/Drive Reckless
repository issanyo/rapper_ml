[Verse 1: Dorrough Music]
Flight at 8 o'clock, left the crib at 6:50
Goin 120 flyin down 360
Virgin first class, booked it at the last minute
One way, and the bitch cost $1050
D-F-Dub, touch down at the L-A-X
Baggage claim, I got the bitches, they're at my express
One was on something, she don't even give a fuck
Bitch damn-near begged me to give it up
Here to run it from the dick ground two some
Talked all that shit didn't do nothin
I'm from Dallas got a 2-1-4 number
While I'm smokin on some 3-1-0 number
Rich shit a bunch of niggas and some foreign wheeler
Obviously, we not your average or your normal niggas
Mention Texas, and they think about some forming niggas
It's way more than some horses and some armadillos

[Hook: Dorrough Music]
(yea) I drive reckless, nigga
(yo) Cuz I'm from Texas, nigga
(yea) I drive reckless, nigga
(yo) Cuz I'm from Texas, nigga
(yea) I drive reckless, nigga
(why) Cuz I'm from Texas, nigga
Getting money, I ain't worried bout a petty nigga

[Verse 2: Dorrough Music]
First class, with the bosses and the C-E-O's
M's, I need at least 33 of those
A bunch of blue-faced honeys and they came for
I'm diving in these hoe's pussy like "GERONIMO"
Thank Texas, everybody drink pink soda
Range Rover, refrigerated cup holders
Game over, leanin cuz I'm not sober
Snow bunny, same color Jody high-roller
Got me swervin in a school-zone
Press a button, and the whole damn roof gone
Got my 4G, got the wheels on the coupe chrome
That's like designer with some Michael Jordan shoes on
Put me anywhere, I bet I'll do the damn thing
And Imma still be rapping when the sound change
Whole bottle, and I'm faded from the champagne
Everybody out here fucking with my campaign

[Hook: Dorrough Music]
(yea) I drive reckless, nigga
(yo) Cuz I'm from Texas, nigga
(yea) I drive reckless, nigga
(yo) Cuz I'm from Texas, nigga
(yea) I drive reckless, nigga
(why) Cuz I'm from Texas, nigga
Gettin money, I ain't worried bout a petty nigga

[Verse 3: RiFF RAFF]
I sip drank drank pank when I shift change
I can change the weather with my pinkie ring
Banana berry diamonds look like 5 flames
Ah shit look who it is; the white Rick James
Should I keep the braids or hit the flat top?
All my girls got curls, Goldilocks
Crocodile [?] cake smell like Betty Crocker
Its that butterscotch boss got that red lobster
Now I’m Scrooge McDuck with them big bucks
I smile for paparazzi like I’m Harry Styles
I need a mermaid with some aqua eyes
Her behind looks like 2 Bavarians cream pies
I can cause a blizzard with my chain and charms
I smoke so hard I set off your principals car alarm
They thought I was a dentist by the way I floss
Texas pink diamonds; hot sauce
