[Verse 1]
Pacin' the floor [?]
Pacin' the floor lookin' for my mind to create...
Hip hop!
So I come with something bug
Meditate - that my rest, here goes my mic plug!
Hook me in when I'm headed downtown
Give my crews [?], they know I'm still around...
Coolin'! Bagging up crews with no doubt
And when I'm rollin' dice, I got my boys on the lookout
[?]
Leavin' them marked like a graffiti tag (tag)
Sp-spray 'em, this [?] no mimic
I run more hoes than a clinic without no gimmick
(Hey!) [?] soon to get [?]
Man, these [?] MCs comin' up short
[?] they still hurtin' me from 5,000
In the club browsin', I don't do the housin'
I like the real sound
That underground sound
The West Coast sound
And that Uptown sound
Oh, how I need a crazy brand new [?]
Girls like the runner - always givin' me peeps
So squeeze it
I'll please it
Time for [?]
More threat
I feel like a mic, so where's my check?
Go get me landscaper, no beatin' around a bush
Signing off, it's Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf

[Outro]

Hey guy
Hey guy

Hey big guy
Hey guy, hey guy, hey guy
Hey guy, hey big guy
Hey guy, hey guy, hey guy
