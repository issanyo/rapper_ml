[Intro sampling of Sounds of Basic Training by Joston's Basic Military Training]
Get ready on the right
Get ready on the left
Get ready on the left

[Verse 1]
Here we are
And we're ready (A hip hip hooray!)
Check with [?] before I bust Mr. Marvin Gaye
I'm a hero down by dirty when I barged in
Ya need that [?] or I rock ya back when
Gettin' on the move, so (so) I must duce
To pay the DMV bills and pay dues
Nigga, I never sing that sad, sad song
I'm not from New York, yet [?] but I'm strong
Outcast, Wall Street, [?]
[?] cause my man to scratch it
My vision is honest and liars see though key holes
You be the Peeping Tom, meanwhile I’m peeping hoes
Frenzy, fanatical freak, f-f-f [?]
I read through honeys with a blindfold
C is for Charizma - B becomes before C
'Cause I was a sick B-Boy, in 1983
Changed my own oil 'cause I couldn’t afford the amount
Thought I had clout 'cause my buckets still boned out
Johnny Carson came, then came Arsenio Hall
Summer, winter, spring came, but I didn't fall
Snag up the young skins, the fat skins
The old skins, the out-of-shape skins
But I'm hittin' skins
Look, the lines are all loaded (loaded)
Ya didn't know until my rhyme unfolded
My penis is my [?] but I did hard work
Hopefully I won't get jerked but if I shall
Here's a smirk

[Bridge]
Yeeeah, and here's a smirk
Uh-huh, on and on
And here's a smirk
Here's a smirk
And on and on

[Verse 2]
What is a book without pages?
Nah, forget the cover, inside I'm flippin' phrases
Guards up, the pranksters play the pranks
Rob your banks but take mine to get shanked (shanked)
Young stunts smoked up at the blunts
Reveal an Evel Knievel and now they wanna pull stunts
The free-fall came [?] an avalanche
I'm handicapped - in the club I don't pursue a dance (la la)
I must be four times his weight [?]
Meantime, others brake like Corn Flakes
I [?] again with my presence at the front door
Just want a little dap - I don't expect an encore (core, core, core)
So what's the reason for the creasin'?
I'm just an average kid rollin' a [?] not a BM...
W, drop the dime, dumb hoes is sneaky
I rest behind doors, therefore they wanna peep me
"You're falling off!" - Not any time soon
Be falling off like [?] in the ocean with a teaspoon
Nice sharp, aim sharp, sharp, I hit the bullseye
I [?] (bzzzz) watch me buzz by
Take 'em off, Honey
Yeah, I'm hesitant
If I was to vote, I'd say Eric B. for President

[Outro]
And yeeeah, here's a smirk
On and on
And here's a smirk
Jerk, here's a smirk
On and on
