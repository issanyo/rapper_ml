[Intro: Charlie C (Charizma) and Cassius T]
Yo party people
I'm the dominating Charlie C
And I'm the devastating Cassius T
And we both want you to know where we come from
Hit it Charlie!
It's like Compton, the Bronx, and Oak-Town City
But one thing's for sure:
Milpitas - we get busy!

[Verse 1: Charlie C (Charizma)]
Coolin' down the street in a sky blue Regal
Goin' much faster than the speed of an eagle
Just coolin' out, not actin' like a clown
So [?] 'cause we're called M-Town
So double up, niggas, yeah, our bass is rockin'
We are M-Town and got the [?] jockin'
Ain't no drug taker, on the go
So throw your hands high - everybody yell, "Hoe!"
'Cause on the microphone it's known as Charlie C
Makin' much [?] with our M-Town posse
Gettin' real busy like a flame in fire
While my bass is rockin' higher and higher
Momentum on my rhyme makes it sound better
The posse's chillin', sportin' truth and letter
Just [?]
[?] we'll beat you down until we gain respect
Now we won't be causin' no trouble like an MC punk
No smokin' that weed or go gettin' drunk
'Cause that's the way to do it 'cause we stay in school
'Cause we're the M-Town posse, goin' do what goin' do
So everybody take a [?] - we ain't playin' around
There's Charlie C and Cassius T and now we're down with M-Town

[Chorus: Charlie C (Charizma) and Cassius T]
Go M-Town (x8)

[Verse 2: Cassius T]
It's me, Cassius T, and yes I'm rockin' the mic
So get with it everybody 'cause I'm doin' it right
Devastater, [?] and you know I'm hip
I'm with my curls for the girls 'cause they on my tip
We're M-Town, and we're down
Now the place is [?]
The beat is steady hittin', and the bass is steady bumpin'
The word is taken for the money - I make it
I put you in check, boy, I ain't fakin
'Cause I'm takin' it to the top in that [?]
Ya big ruthless gets offended, yo, he's down with the crew
But my [?]
Lookin' like us - watch a nigga - see why he's mad
Plowin' down niggas all the way to the top
Ya [?] and [?] knockin' down non-stop
I'm gonna keep on goin' 'cause I know you're devastated
My rhymes are hittin' hard 'cause my tongue is gonna [?] it
And me and Charlie C can never be beat
We never knew the true meaning of the work of the beat
The half-shot gun [?]
Pretty boy [?]
Everybody take a taste - we ain't playin' around
It's Cassius T and Charlie and we down with M-Town

[Chorus: Charlie C (Charizma) and Cassius T]
Go M-Town (x8)
