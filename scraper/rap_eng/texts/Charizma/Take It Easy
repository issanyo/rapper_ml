You know
We take it easy
When I'm clownin' with my boys - we take it easy
And when I'm just coolin' alone - we take it easy
When I'm out on my peers - we take it easy
Sippin' on some apple juice, takin' it easy
When I'm swingin' with a sweetie - we take it easy
What-whatever I'm doin' - we take it easy
It's just me and PB , takin it easy
