It's a call to love
Love and mercy
It's a call to give
And ask for nothing in return
It's a call to hope
For the hope of glory
It's a call to live
To grow in grace and try and learn
What it means to give your life away
A house divided will never stand
Let's join together
We're stronger hand in hand

[Chorus]
Common struggle
Common to the eveyday man
Common table
The body and the blood
Common Savior
For God so loved the world
What we need
Is a common creed

It's a call to arms
It's a fight of faith
Sound the alarm
No time to lose, no time to waste
In this war for the soul of man
A house divided will never stand
Let's join together
We're stronger hand in hand

[Chorus]
Common struggle
Common to the eveyday man
Common table
The body and the blood
Common Savior
For God so loved the world
What we need
Is a common creed

I believe in God the Father
In Jesus Christ His only Son
I believe there's only one way to the Father
By grace through faith alone

[Chorus]
Common struggle
Common to the eveyday man
Common table
The body and the blood
Common Savior
For God so loved the world
What we need
Is a common creed
