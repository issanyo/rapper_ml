[Verse 1 Charizma]

Charizma Charizma what
Charizma Charizma who
Charizma Charizma BA! Wilder then a zoo ain't that true
(I start to slam rhymes like captain caveman)
Yo Chris rewind it man (get that shit)
Kick that shit Charizma i shit i put things in motion
I'm not boasting rhymes deeper then an ocean
So put this shit on file cause i'm buck wild
Sure enough got style ruthless like a juvenile
Cause many MCs can't hang tough
Started off blust and they soon got snuffed (ya snuffed em)
Yo G damn right i did gave em a bib and shook em in the crib
Like a lullaby my mama song when i was two years old
And taught me not to (pass the Old Gold)
But the apple juice what Charizma drunk in a quiet storm
Watch the butt till morn that's what is born
Cause i'm flexing style like Lou Ferrigno
Ya know bro yo i make the crowd scream ho and ho and ho
When i flow slow like Heavy D don't ya know
Many where stiff like scarecrows
Some may say what are ya talking about Charizma
Yo i'm just saying Charizma funkier then tizma
So clap your hands or give me a pound and a half
Ill break fast to bust another rapper's ahh
While the duck MCs flex like jerks
Thoughts that they was dope
Had hopes like a mini skirt
To say reggae-reggae but if you try to get fly
You bucked my man you just get fucked in the eye
(another young brother hit)
And like an acrobat my metaphors start to flip and flip
Up and down like a seesaw often like a pit bull jaw this shit is raw
I start to slam damn gee you don't know who i am
Play it again, nope it ain't Sam or Samuel
But i still go for allot of them
They say i'm grim like they was drunk of strong gin

[Verse 2 Charizma]

I'm not the biz but ya caught the vapors
Rhymes stacked like papers
Gee call me the rhyme taper
Because i'm taking over the city like strangling
Bash it and crash it tangle it and dis mangle it up
While you sip the cup of that night train
You must be insane G i'm doper then cocaine
Flipping a rhyme
Spitting a rhyme
Lifting a rhyme
Kicking a rhyme
Sip a little wine and like the sun i shall shine
Cause i'm shining on foes like a light beam
Check out the scene while scooping girls in denim jeans
Because brothers can't come close when it is a joke
Yea money you got smoked
Smoked like bees out of a bee hive
DJ Pioneer give me a high five
Now get real swift this record didn't miss that's why suckers hiss
Like a snake but my name ain't jake
Because most MCs fake
Get on the mic and it breaks like corn flakes
I ain't tryna restate my name in the rap game
Rhymes so dope they go down in the hall of fame
Charizma yo that's the name i'm flowing on
I'm not from New York ye island but i'm strong
I like to get dope with the track that's real smooth
Rhymes more funkier then your boy's locker room
To the room where my metaphor's will mate at my west to keep flowing
And will rhymes till i'm out of breath

[Verse 3 Charizma]

I play like pop corn and knock ya out the box while ya talk
So now the Disco brothers on my chuck or should i say on my dismick
But i like flow with my bitch so i ain't trying to hear that weak shit
Hold my throne as my shoes hit the concrete
Rhymes and fleece mixed like water and cream of the wheat
So lay the track down clown cover the frown
Lets start slamming rhymes like if i was doing beat downs
(Yo producer Chris)
Yo he made this shit real swift now its time for me Charizma to shoot the gift
The hip hop scene i'm stepping into 91
Blasting metaphors off like guns (are you the metaphoric one?)
Yo you got that right troupe
Got more rhymes then the colors of fruit loops
But i ain't coming to preach about some damn cereal
Just to lay some dope hip hop material
Its like that y'all that's all
Releasing steam like a hot spore hot spore
To the this and a to the that and a
If your TV is broke you get an antenna
Peace
