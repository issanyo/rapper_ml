[Verse 1: Charizma]
(My A-)dida dida duck naw its only the ice cream truck
But use caution because you can get [?] (yeah, yeah)
Its a part of the city life
Where guns are strapped the raw raw packs of sharp knives
But I watch my step though though
Just [?] myself a ticket, followers, and tack and toes
Me the boys they carry [?] freedom of speech
I wish I could say the same over hip hip hop beats
They run the run the streets they run the fad and I'm quite glad
'Cause I'll be damned to go out like a maxi maxi pad
To put some [?] on all the [?] with the yo-yo
Just like any bro I'm thinking on how to get some dough
Left sing in ritty tin tin
'Cause with no dough you get no clothes and no spins
I think its everywhere but I don't know because I ain't been there there
But the ice cream truck has, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Charizma]
Here comes the ice cream truck oh where you wow wow
Here come the ice cream truck (slam now)
Here comes the ice cream truck, no need to duck and duck
I just (jump on the mic and I earn a quick)
Here comes the ice cream truck oh where you wow wow
Here come the ice cream truck (slam now)
Here comes the ice cream truck, no need to duck and duck
I just (jump on the mic and I earn a quick)

[Verse 2: Charizma]
Pop's had Jenny and Jenny was on his jimmy
Now she got her hand out
You got so many to lend me
Go find another another bush, go ask mom dukes for loot
Okay they have push-ups, but you don't have to push up too
Cut my hat threw on some courts and a hood
And just like in my hood in the truck there's something good
Not just just bad black crew crews
Christmas time's the only season for the scrooge
I'm saying this because I sorta had some doubt
About the ice cream truck getting no clout
If you don't see the truck, you'll usually see the man
The man with the belt, always pushing the stand
It's a small world you didn't know what to say say
America today is a crazy place to stay stay
So who's the bad guy, oh well, lets keep a good faith
I hope the ice cream truck win wins the race
'Cause a mile away I may be walking walking
Behind my back you're always talking talking
What did you say? Who knows? I bet the ice cream truck did did
Because it was creeping around your crib
There it goes, there's the kids that wanna place the order
To the nickles to the dimes [?] the quarter
Its a crazy road, crazy road, ran five blocks
You can give some [?] to the ice cream truck

[Chorus: Charizma]
Here comes the ice cream truck oh where you wow wow
Here come the ice cream truck (slam now)
Here comes the ice cream truck, no need to duck and duck
I just (jump on the mic and I earn a quick)
Here comes the ice cream truck oh where you wow wow
Here come the ice cream truck (slam now)
Here comes the ice cream truck, no need to duck and duck
I just (jump on the mic and I earn a quick)

[Verse 3: Charizma]
Whoopie doo doo who cares? The ice cream truck
Man I don't give a (unh)
Wait a minute don't [?]
Its here its there its everywhere making papes
Bumping the same old ice cream truck truck tape
Your Timberlands and hoodies ain't no good for the sun
Cool off and get some ice cream I'll be funkier than a bum
[?]
Where did the ice cream truck come come from?
I'm not down with cat in the hat
I'm not down with cat in the hat
The ice cream truck was for the kids before the Dr. Seuss [?]
Rolling through any hood playing [?] for the treads
Hip hop was living so [?] bob your heads
Politics I don't deal with a bunch of mischief
The president has beef with, the president has beef with
Hmm I don't know the answer 'cause I ain't been there there
But the ice cream truck has yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Charizma]
Here comes the ice cream truck oh where you wow wow
Here come the ice cream truck (slam now)
Here comes the ice cream truck, no need to duck and duck
I just (jump on the mic and I earn a quick)
Here comes the ice cream truck oh where you wow wow
Here come the ice cream truck (slam now)
Here comes the ice cream truck, no need to duck and duck
I just (jump on the mic and I earn a quick)
