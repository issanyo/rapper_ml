[Verse 1]
Hi, I'm a sucker MC
Well then move
'Cause Charizma comes off slammin'
This ain't a game like backgammon
There is no echoes in my flow, you know, bro, I come swift
Shootin' the gift, funky like a porno flick
My own brothers: to your own seat this world is born
Because lyrics go smooth just like a jazz horn
When I get ill with the quickness
Some said, "What is this?"
My skinny brother shootin' the gift like Christmas
While I flow slow, but disco MCs got hurt
Tryin' to swing, but how to help is like a mini-skirt
In a brain of a madman with a mic full of ammo
Lightin' black like a piano
So I raise my hand for power, though I'm still half of Uncle Sam
But my dominant half is African
So pop-it-to-the-pop-it-to-the-fist-fist
Oh, what a belief it is!
You caught the vapors, so play biz
Word [?] is that I'm in the rap game, headed for fame
'Cause lyrics [?] than a Great Dane
Call me the massacre, that attacks the whole wack-raps
That got us lost like blackjack
From 1-10, yo G, I don't rate myself
But give a 10 and snap an MC like a belt
See, Chris Cut will put you down with the chain gang
[?] like yo, "Put the cocaine"
1-2-3, I'll get swift with this track
Bringin' MCs bad luck just like a black cat
But I ain't superstitious, maybe delicious
Shootin' the gift with the Riz, so what is this?
I ain't the one to be put down on the ground with a frown
Spittin' rhymes like a merry-go-round
