[Verse 1]

Let me know is it time?
I'm coming over your radio so I bust rhymes
High school was cool and I got a little clout
Debating with the girls who will I meet when schools out?
I cut my hat and my mind own, most of the time alone
Don't put me on hold I'm not a telephone
It's a full moon and PB wolf goes out
I'm shy with the girls cause' I seem them move (bows?)
I lost my shoes but honey you can fit in them
If there's a kid better than me well girl stick with him
My stereo is loud, you said turn off the noise
Treating me like greasy pizza but I'm not avoid the noid
The day after the dawn came
You got on soup said you lift rods like a great Dane
I'm just a normal kid that walked to school every day
And wrote letters to the girls from Denise to Shante
I rock the show when the house was packed
Yeah my man got my back but there's always the feedback
Should I make the move, yes, no, I'm a goner
I always wondered if the girl would let me push up on her
Check one two with the check one two
I end my first verse like that its old school

[Hook]

Fair weather friend, (friend)
Depending on the weather and my mood that day(day)
Fair weather friend, (friend)
Fair weather friend, (friend)
Depending on the weather and my mood that day, day
Fair weather friend.(friend)
Fair weather friend

[Verse 2]
And once a here we go but I'll say check it
He's the DJ but girls break records
Special Ed was the jam and you wasn't around
When I was gloomy just when I was getting pounds
Blow on, on the last straw in the shuffle
So stop thinking twos, face it girl were not a couple
You know the story cause you left when you got bored
And that didn't phase me I line girls up like a cross scores
Ahh I taught myself how to rhyme
Cause' anything can happen at any, any given time
I said it once and i'll say it again, at any given time
At any given time, any given time
Damn it's a shame I had to say it four times
I hop in my bucket and zoomed around your town
I won't be around cause what goes up, up comes down

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Snap where's the girl at? I chill with
Don't want to devour my thoughts,yeah with her I'm ruined
Some things go, something's I said, free
If she doesn't come back then it wasn't meant to be, its that easy
From a long shot she was out to get mines
That's like listening to rock and playing hip hop at the same time
Girl, my fair weather friend and my ink pen
I wrote in between the line guess who dropped in
Brother lamp lamp for a genie, cause you can't even see me
Trying to gas me up for a freebee
Your midnight promises and I'm itching for some cat
I maybe a skinny kid but there's hopes of getting fat
Don't use me, I might bust on you and pay the cost
There's a law with my girls you either get with or get lost
Or slide over if you got a bunk reputation
You wanna get paid? then honey fill out an application
You had it coming with those tricks up your sleeve
Cause the things are not okay with an A, I'm not a spelling bee
Cause I'll be damned to get tossed and I'm my only boss and
Hits skins like Johnson and Johnson
Frankly that's just to let you know
A one two, a one two, and I'm out with the show
