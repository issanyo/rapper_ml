Paroles de la chanson Just Get Up And Dance :
Afrika bambaataa
Yo let's funk this party up
Right over here
I said murda
Come on
Get back and do the groove

(chorus)
Ya'll just get up and dance
You got to get up and dance
Ya'll just get up and dance
Yeah
Ya'll just get up and dance
You got to get up and dance
Ya'll just get up and dance
Yeah
(repeat)
You got to get up and dance
Afrika bambaataa
What's this phony ceremony
Hanging around
We got to get down
Lock it out from this shaky ground
Come on and spit it out
Your hearty party
Mood everywhere
Let's see you people laughing
People punching out in the air
Get down to the hip hop a
Bee bop a loo a
You hear the sound it's all
Coming to ya
I wanna get ya
I wanna tease ya

I'm gonna get this beat to hit ya
Get down to big time illusion
Life or the rest
Come on and tough it jump it
Funk that feeling
Give all your best

(chorus)
Come on and drive on drive on
Drive on into night
You got that burning power
Midnight hour
Flashing your light
It's just a love game of heart
And pain
That we're ging out
Taht's what the twenty first
Century is all about
Get down to the hip hop a
Bee bop a loo a
You hear the sound it's all
Coming to ya
I wanna get ya
I wanna tease ya
I'm gonna get this beat to hit ya
Get down to big time illusion
Step into time
Come on and rock it sock it
Just jump on it
Live is divine

(chorus)
Afrika bambaataa
