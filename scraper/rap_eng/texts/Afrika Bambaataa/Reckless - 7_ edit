You make me reckless, reckless everyday
You make me reckless
Standin' by the disco floor
Spot this girl

My heart jump and move
Yeah, yeah
Walk over said to her
Lovely things

She said I was a fool
Oh no
She said
This is not the right time baby

I came here to groove
Hmm
And recklessly
I took my time

When I look back
The girls had made a move
Yeah, yeah
The music played on, played on

Why didn't you make your move
Somebody came on, came on
And stole the girl from you

It's the groove
That makes you move
So come on and get down
To this funky sound

Do what you please
You are entitled to flaunt
Get wild and reckless
If you want

'Cause the sound we deliver
Will take you higher
Most definitely with
Desire, desire, de si si si sire

You make me reckless, reckless everyday
You make me reckless
You make me reckless, reckless everyday
You make me reckless

You make me reckless, reckless everyday
You make me reckless
You make me reckless, reckless everyday
You make me reckless

So as the music play
I had to find a way
To catch her eye
Yeah, yeah

The partner she was with
He did not know how to gig
Said I
Oh no

She said
Mister get away from me
I need a man
That knows how to move

Yeah, yeah
We start to dance
Suddenly a quick romance
Ooooo yeah, yeah

The music played on, played on
Why didn't you make your move
Somebody came on, came on
And stole the girl from you

This is a message
That you should discover
You can't trust a girl
Or judge them by the cover

They can lead you on
And keep you in a daze
Keep you head over heels
And keep you amazed

It's up to you
Whether you fall in the trap
Just remember when you push up
To have a strong rap

'Cause now-a-days
Things are real funny
You can bet more than all she wants
Is your money

So listen to what I say
With or without
Yo, the girls is OK
Girls are the same everywhere

You can bet all they want from you
Is what they can get
And when they finish
You can bet that you've tried her

They'll leave you penniless
With desire

You make me reckless
You make me reckless, reckless everyday
You make me reckless
