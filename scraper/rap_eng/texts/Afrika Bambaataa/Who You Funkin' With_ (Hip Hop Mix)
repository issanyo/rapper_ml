[Reprise]
Thinkin' of a beat that'll make you move your feet
Cuttin' like who? Scratchin' like who?
Makin' up a rap that'll make your hand clap
Talkin' like who? Soundin' like who?
Make up a name straighten up your game
Livin' like who? Breathin' like who?
And now we're here with the lesson for your ears
Messin' with who? Funkin' with who?

Echoes are heard and all of the word
About the first street jam that took the lid off the can
We are the juice that fills the cup
Everybody took a sip and got all funked up
Some people fell down and moved with a trance
And when they sobered up it was called break dance
Every fair's like a [?] in my musical chair
And if you dis and [?] you was considered to be a square

[Hook]
Who do you think you're funkin' with? Huh, who?
Who do you think you're funkin' with? Huh, who?
Who do you think you're funkin' with? Huh, who?
Who do you think you're funkin' with? Huh, who?

Back in the days, we're on a reign
Where the mighty street gangs were a popular name
Bull [?] hearts and guts, were surely a must
We're talkin' about who? We're talkin' 'bout us
Two dollars a head and the king of the pack
With a one dollar [?]
The DJ plays his record, upon his thrown
While we the MCs rock the microphone
Like the [?]
You thought you were the best with your fake jack game
You thought you were a king, but you're just a pawn
And now all of your knights and gonna get stepped on

We left the footprints in the sands of time
And now we're gonna leave on in your mind
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Will never wanna funk with us again

[Reprise]
Thinkin' of a beat that'll make you move your feet
Cuttin' like who? Scratchin' like who?
Makin' up a rap that'll make your hand clap
Talkin' like who? Soundin' like who?
Make up a name straighten up your game
Livin' like who? Breathin' like who?
And now we're here with the lesson for your ears
Messin' with who? Funkin' with who?

The gem, the jewel, the power to be cool
The ones that made it straight from the old school
The writers, the fighters, that builders to provide us
The ones that made it better for all you biters

[?]
We took you to the bridge and we dropped ya off
You bit all you can chew so now get lost

[Hook]
Who do you think you're funkin' with? Huh, who?
Who do you think you're funkin' with? Huh, who?

[Melle Mel]
On the thrown of stone I sit alone
With the undisputed ruler of the microphone
My polo [?] is the clothes I wear
The crown is the braids in my hair
I do push-ups like the ones in jail
[?] in the street like I'm out on bail
But I never do time for takin' the crime
'cause my name is Melle Mel and the streets is mine

[Mr. Biggs]
Paint in your mind homeboy a picture
You're my student I'm your teacher
I can tell through the years you've been listenin' well
But I totalled up the score and I'm sorry you failed
Because if you bite a style it can't be exact
Damn homeboy I taught you better than that
I would've told you how to [?] and make it better
My name is Mr. Biggs and I'm a trend-setter

[Pow Wow]
[?]
And if you think you're ready come and get a taste of this
Pow will make you feel low
[?]

[MC G.L.O.B.E.]
Simply comprehend the reason I ascend
To the height of light that accumulates strength [?]
The historical being known as MC G.L.O.B.E
The G-L-O-B-E baby
Now if your main goal is to be like G.L.O.B.E
I hate to bust your bubble but that's a no-no
It's inevitable [?]
Inevitably you could be the G-L-O-B-E

(Outro)
Shake it baby shake it shake shake it baby
