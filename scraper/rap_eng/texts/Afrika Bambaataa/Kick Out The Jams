You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta kick 'em out
Yeah

Well I feel pretty good
And I guess that I could get crazy now baby
’Cause we all got in tune
When the dressing room got hazy now baby

I know how you want it
Hot, quick and tight
The girls can't stand it
When you're doin’ right
Let me up on the stand
And let me kick out the jams
Yeah, kick out the jams
Got to kick'em out!
Yeah
Yeah

Yes I'm starting to sweat
You know my shirt's all wet
What a feeling
It's the sound that abounds
And resounds and rebounds off the ceiling

You gotta have it baby
You can't do without
When you get that feeling
You gotta sock it out
So put the mic in my hand
And let me kick out the jams
Yes, kick out the jams

So you got to give it up
You know you can't get enough Miss McKenzie (McKenzie)
'Cause it gets in your brain
Drive you insane
Keep in frenzy

[?] guitars
And the crash of the drums
Makes you wanna keep-a-rockin’
’Til the morning comes

Let me be who I am
And let me kick out the jams
Yeah, kick out the jams
Got to kick 'em out!

Ohhh

Clap your hands and stomp your feet (Kick out the jams)
This here music makes you feel the beat (Kick out the jams)
Hard rock, is in your soul (Kick out the jams)
But just be careful, it can take control (Kick out the jams)
Let your mind and your body flow (Kick out the jams)
This ain’t no go-go, this is rock'n'roll (Kick out the jams)

Yes I'm starting to sweat
You know my shirt’s all wet
I can feel it
It's the sound that abounds
And resounds and rebounds off the ceiling

You gotta have it baby
You can't do without
When you get that feeling
You gotta sock it out
So put the mic in my hands
And let me kick out the jams
Yes, kick out the jams
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Death, life is rock'n'roll (Rock'n'Roll)
Rock'n'Roll music, it takes control (Takes control)
Put your mind, body and soul (Body and soul)
Put me on the stand, let me kick out the jams (Kick out the jams)
Whoa-oh (Whoa-oh)
Whoa-oh (Whoa-oh)
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
Ah-hey-ay-hey-ay (Hey-ay-hey-ay)
Ah-hey-ay-hey-ay (Hey-ay-hey-ay)
Rock'n'Roll (Rock'n'Roll)
Is in my soul (Is in my soul)
Yeah

[?] guitars
And the crash of the drums
Makes you wanna keep-a-rockin'
'Til the morning comes

Let me be who I am
And let me kick out the jams
Yeah, kick out the jams
I done kicked 'em out!
