[Strofa 1: Graziano Romani ed Elio e le Storie Tese]
I am in the room, waiting for Santa and for Claus
Suddenly, by night, they will arrive; (by night, by night, by night!)
Can't you feel the typical cling, cling, cling, cling, cling?
Presents for the good, coal for the bad:
Proprio come diceva mia mamma!

[Ritornello 1: Graziano Romani]
Christmas with the yours, Easter what you want;
Peace between Blur and Oasis!
Christmas with the yours, Easter what you want;
Don't throw atomic bombs, because it's Christmas time!

[Strofa 2: Elio e Graziano Romani]
Panettone is on the table, and everybody's drinking Moscato
Go to buy a tree, but not a true tree
Because otherwise it would die, die, die, die, die!
Panettone is on the table, but it is another one;
Infatti Ã¨ quello senza canditi!

[Ritornello 2: Graziano Romani]
Christmas with the yours, Easter what you want;
Peace between Lino e Cecchetto!
Christmas with the yours, Easter what you want;
Don't drop atomic bombs, at least at Christmas time!

[Outro: Graziano Romani e Elio e le Storie Tese]
Proprio come diceva mia mamma!
Sai cosa diceva mia mamma?

Christmas with the yours, Easter what you want;
Peace between Lino e Cecchetto!
Christmas with the yours, Easter what you want;
Livin' the refreshing world of Christmas!
Monsieur Chirac, garde la bombe chez toi!
