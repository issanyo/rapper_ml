Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey........

The Soulsonic Force, Mr. Biggs, Pow Wow and MC Globe
Shakin' your soul and it's sort of mad
When the music is frantic and the spirit is happenin
State of mind, it's a reminisce
In a musical sense if you get right to it
It's timely situation
With your own creation
Should be electric, cause it's frantic

Isn't it a wonder
We are the gun and thunder
We're on the same mission
Come on everybody listen
People all across the nation
Who thinks they have imagination
Everyone wants to see you groove
And cause your frantic body to move

It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation

Zing zang zing zang zang zang......

So come on everybody
Everybody come on
Let's all get together and rock along
Twist and scream and shout
Shout
Twist and scream and shout

Now do what you came here to
In order to get ready you gotta get loose
Say !
Say what ?
Everybody say
Say !
Say what ?
It's a frantic, it's a frantic situation
Situation

Worlwide, worldwide
It's a musical drive
Ain't masterbation
It's a proclamation
All across the nation
It's a happy situation

Now say
Zing zang zing zang zang zang ......

It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation......
