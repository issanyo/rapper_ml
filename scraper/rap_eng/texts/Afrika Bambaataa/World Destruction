Speak about destruction. (x3)
This is a world destruction, your life ain't nothing
The human race is becoming a disgrace
Countries are fighting with chemical warfare
Not giving a damn about the people who live

Won't stand in the way of the Islamic force
The CIA is looking for other detectives
The KGB is smarter than you think
Brainwash mentalities to control the system
Using TV and movies - religions of course
Yes, the world is headed for destruction
Is it a nuclear war?
What are you asking for?
This is a world destruction. Your life ain't nothing
The human race is becoming a disgrace
The rich get richer
The poor are getting poorer
Fascist, chauvinistic government fools
People, Moslems, Christians and Hindus
Are in a time zone just searching for the truth
Who are you to think you're a superior race?
Facing forth your everlasting doom
We are Time Zone. We've come to drop a bomb on you
World destruction, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom!
Iæ?¦ going out of my mind that makes two of us-Iæ?¦ going out of my mind
This is the world destruction, your life ain't nothing
The human race is becoming a disgrace
Nationalities are fighting with each other
Why is this? Because the system tells you
Putting people in faceless categories
Knowledge isn't what it used to be
Military tactics to control a nation
Who wants to be a president or king? Me!
Mother Nature is gonna work against you
Nothing in your power that you can do
Yes, the world is headed for destruction
You and I know it, the Bible tells you
If we don't start to look for a better life
The world will be destroyed in a time zone!
Iæ?¦ in a time zone (x3) Speak about destruction (x1) Iæ?¦ in a time zone (x3)
