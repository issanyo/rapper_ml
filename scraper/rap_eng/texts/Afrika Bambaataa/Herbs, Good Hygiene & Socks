I don't dig a lot of the establishment
Well, your ideas and values
They may work for you but
They don't all work for me
As far as I'm concerned
Some are with it
And well some aren't

Hmm, that's a hard one to say
It's hard to say, I'd say
Well wash your ass every day
Wash your whole body every day
And brush your breath at least 2 or 3 times a day
With your teeth, and then you know, wash the face

Do any of these things prevent venereal disease, besides the rubbers?

Carry some of your herbal or salt or pepper around in your pocket
Stuff, it opens up in your pocket and gets mixed up with your lint cotton
Or mess with the flavour cause when you take the herb and put it in your mouth
Then you gonna be eatin' somethin' then you got little strings of lint pullin' on your teeth
So you just take it out and use the string for flossin'

That's... that's far out
What do you feel is the best way to
To keep from getting a, a chick pregnant?
I mean..., what do you do?

Well, you need different pairs of socks
You know, some times you need the coloured socks
That's if you're gonna wear one pair of socks to hide your dirt
Then every, every, every other couple of days I mean, you wear the white sock
You can wear them probably 1 or 2 days
Until you try to walk aroun' an' they get caught in the carpet
Then the dirt used up from the carpet gets up into your sock
Then you get the little black spots on the side
Or you can go and get, you know, the different types
There's other types of socks that's made for shoes
But then they get funky and your feet start sweatin' and stuff
Or you can get sweat socks that grab the sweat so they won't be funking
And you get the powder into put it in so you won't get the funk or the funky feet
Or that little feet and the stink is you have to be the funk
Cuz when you die you go back to the funk
And if you got sock funk you got to be funky cause it stinkin
Or something ran up in your ass and just died
