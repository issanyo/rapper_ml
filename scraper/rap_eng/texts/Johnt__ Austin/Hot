For the Y2K... new millennium... make it hot...
Toni, drop the first verse...

[Verse 1:]
Baby, since I've been with you
I can't stay away from you
I swear what you be doin
Got me so wide open and I can't control it babe
Baby, I'm so into you
You make me wanna stay with you
Every second of every minute
Got me so wide open and I must admit it that you're

[Chorus:]
Hot! boy you know you are so
Hot! you're the only one for me
Every little thing you do to me
Every little thing I wanna do for you
Hot! boy you're makin me so
Hot! tell me anything you want
Every little thing you say to me
Every little thing I think of you baby

[Verse 2:]
Honey, what you mean to me
Is more than any other thing
Can't front, the love you're givin to me
Is the best straight up, the bomb-diggy-diggy and
Honey, you stay on my mind
No other love I wanna try
Stick around cuz it's gettin better by the minute
And i, I must admit it that you're...

[Chorus] (2x)

[Bridge:]
Every little thing you say to me
Every little thing you do to me
All of the things you make me feel
Boy you know you're really makin me hot
Every little thing you say to me
Every little thing you do to me
All of the things you make me feel
Boy you know you're really makin me hot

[Chorus] (2x)
