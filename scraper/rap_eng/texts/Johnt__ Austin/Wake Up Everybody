[Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes + Teddy Pendergrass]
Wake up everybody
No more sleepin' in bed
No more backward thinkin'
Time for thinkin' ahead

The world has changed
So very much
From what it used to be
There is so much hatred
War and poverty, whoa, oh

[Ryan: Alexandra]
Wake up, all the teachers
Time to teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen
To what'cha have to say

[Ryan: Alexandra]
'Cause they're the ones who's coming up
And the world is in their hands
When you teach the children
Teach 'em the best way you can

[Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes & Teddy Pendergrass+(Alexandra)]
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be, na, na, na
The world won't get no better
(We gotta change it, yeah
Just you and me)

[Sean Cross]
Wake up everybody
And look at the storm comin'
Blood in the streets
And the tears in my eyes runnin'

[Sean Cross]
Recognize who I am
Release 'em out the can
Never was an animal or three fourths of a man
They set this up for peacefully

[Sean Cross]
Wasn't in God's plan
If we all created equally
Why these officers beatin' me?
Divided as a people

[Sean Cross]
Then all we need is some unity
A unified front and then we build our community
Put our pennies together
And put an end to poverty
And violence is not the answer
War's worser than cancer
But peace can never come
With frustration and anger
A nation that's divided
Well that's a nation in danger

[Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes+ Teddy Pendergrass]
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be, na, na, na
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah
Just you and me
