(Okay) Oh, ooh yeah, hey, hey
(Okay) oh yeah

Girl, what's up?
What's going on?
Had to call you
Guess what
He done ran out the house
Talking about he going down to the the pool hall
With his friends

That's the third time in a week
He been hanging out in the street
But I don't know I done seen (okay)
Strange numbers on the caller ID
I ain't tripping, let him go
Don't say nothing, do your thing
Not a problem
But what he don't know is
I know the game
Oooh, he ain't fooling me, no, no
Ain't a lie that he done told
That I ain't told once before, no no no no

[Chorus:]
Girl, he think he's slick, but he's not
He ain't getting over
'Cause I know what's up (ooh, oh, oh)
He must think I'm stupid but I'm not
He ain't telling me
Nothing I believe
(he ain't tellin me)
Girl, he think he's slick, but he's not
He ain't getting over
'Cause I know what's up (ooh, oh, oh)
He really think I'm stupid but I'm not
He ain't telling me
Nothing I believe

[Verse 2:]
Oh, but cool
Something else
He don't know I came up on the code
To his voicemail the other day
Called it up and heard her say
(Meet me)
At the same spot, on the same floor
In the same room, 'round the same time
With the same cologne
With the same wine
That we sipped on last night
What the hell does he think he's doing?
Funny thing is, I should be mad but I'm not
Game recognize game so I'm moving on
He found a new love, so he can find a new spot
To lay his head down

(*sound of keys* )
[Male voice] Hey Toni, open the door!
Creep? Wha? No, I'm not a creep, I was down the pool hall
Now, c'mon now, girl, open up the door!

[Chorus:]
Girl, he think he's slick, but he's not (girl)
He ain't getting over
'Cause I know what's up
He must think I'm stupid but I'm not
(I know what's up)
He ain't telling me
(Girl he think I'm stupid!)
Nothing I believe
(No no no no nothing)
Girl, he think he's slick, but he's not
He ain't getting over
'Cause I know what's up
(He ain't getting over)
He really think I'm stupid but I'm not  (yeah, yeah)
He ain't telling me
Nothing I believe

(Nothing I believe, no
No, no, no, no )


It's time for me to leave you alone
(I know)
I put your things outside
You need to call you a ride
'Cause this is "so long"

Hey fellas, if you lying to your girl
9 times out of 10
She knows exactly what the deal is
So think twice before you lie (okay)
To get by, an alibi
We ain't stupid
You ain't slick
And we're through with this, through with this

[Chorus]

(Girl)
(He think)
(I know what's up, oh)
(He ain't tellin me, no, no, no, no)
(He think he slick, but he ain't)
(No, no, no, no)
(He ain't foolin, no, no)
