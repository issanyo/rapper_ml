[Verse 1: Melanie Fiona]
If only you knew all the love I had inside
If only I told you
That you were my greatest pride
If only I showed you just how good you made me feel
Maybe I wouldn’t be alone and you would be right here but
I don’t wanna do it over
The first time has gone away
You can’t rewind the past
All I can do is say

[Hook: Melanie Fiona]
This time, I’m doing much better
Love you like I never
Ever loved you before
Oh baby, not this time
I’m giving my heart and soul
That I reach out for my love
If you say yes I’ll give you my best
This time

[Verse 2: Melanie Fiona]
This time, I’m gonna be stronger
This time I’ll do it all the way
This time I’ll be a better woman
This time I won’t get in my own way
I could go back you never would have gone
If I knew then what I know now
I’ve told you all that I’ve built for you in my heart
In my head I know what I should’ve said
I know what I shoulda did
But I don’t wanna do it over
The first time is gone away
You can’t revive the past
All I can do is say

[Hook: Melanie Fiona]
This time, I’m doing much better
Love you like I never
Ever loved you before
Oh baby, not this time
I’m giving my heart and soul
That I reach out for my love
If you say yes I’ll give you my best
This time

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
If looks kill then Melanie you a felony
We both hot I guess we couldn’t take the jealousy
All in my ear I had my homeboys telling me
How to be a player, we fell off like Bill Bellamy
MTV shhh, we used to watch Law and Order, NBC shh
But now I’m watching solo on some empty seat shit
Thinking of you, I got a lot more drinking to do
Reminiscing, though I seen it coming
Yeah I had a premonition
Right beside each other and somehow it felt distant
Lets rewind back when days sunny like Liston
Smile just glisten, your booty like a cushion
Is this the moment where we making up
And realise we tripping forever breaking up
And then I break you off, put you to sleep
Know its deep when the girl of his dreams is the same one to wake him up

[Hook: Melanie Fiona]
This time, I’m doing much better
Love you like I never
Ever loved you before
Oh baby, not this time
I’m giving my heart and soul
That I reach out for my love
If you say yes I’ll give you my best
This time
