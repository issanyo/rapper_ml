[Verse 1]
Listen, I'd be a liar if I told you that I didn't see it coming
Be more of a liar if I said, "Hey, I didn't want it to be something"
You deserve much better for the love that you have shared
I know you won't believe it, but girl, I swear

[Bridge]
That I got love for you, big love for you
Even when I'm tripping
The fact remains that you will always be my baby
My baby
But dig the truth, baby, dig the truth
I can't hide my feelings
Especially when the whole world can see

[Chorus]
That my heart is in two different places
I got you in my life and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces
And I can't break ties 'cause they both look right
Someone tell me, what's a man to do when he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie, but he can't tell the truth?
What's a man to do when he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart in two different places?

[Verse 2]
I know you feel it 'cause you stayed
There is much more to this story
But I'd be a fool to say I trust her and I'm always gonna love her
You know that you don't wanna hear
How I'm living on the edge, baby
So I just say, "Yeah, baby"
She ain't nothing, but she is real
But why I take her through it

[Bridge]
When I still got love for you, big love for you
Even when I'm tripping
The fact remains that you will always be my baby
My baby
But dig the truth, baby, dig the truth
I can't hide my feelings
Especially when the whole world can see

[Chorus]
That my heart is in two different places
I got you in my life and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces
And I can't break ties 'cause they both look right
Someone tell me, what's a man to do when he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie, but he can't tell the truth?
What's a man to do when he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart in two different places?

[Bridge]
I wanna tell you it's over, that I ain't thinking of her
I wanna really mean it, that I want you to see it
That I'm really trying to leave her behind
And I'm trying not to make you cry
I wanna tell you that I ain't playing games
And I'm dedicated to receive a change
But when I look in the mirror, it's the same old man

[Chorus]
That my heart is in two different places
I got you in my life and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces
And I can't break ties 'cause they both look right
Someone tell me, what's a man to do when he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie, but he can't tell the truth?
What's a man to do when he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart in two different places?

[Outro]
Not in two different places
