[Verse 1]
Just when I thought I found me someone I can go with
Just when I thought I found me someone I can roll with
That's when my girl friend came to me
Swear she told me that niggah ain't nothing
I seen him in the club acting like you wasn't nowhere around
That's when I found out that you was nothing for me
Another love that said you had, but it turned out to be phony
And I done gave you the best part
I don't know what else I can do to turn you around

[Chorus]
You got me waiting
You got me waiting
When I'm tellin' everything you need to hear
Like baby, come now
You got me waiting
Boy, I can't keep waiting on you
Actin' like whatever I will always be around
Cause you think that you're something like a pimp
And you can hang in these streets and it will be alright with me
Oh, baby now
You got me waiting
Boy, I can't keep waiting on you

[Verse 2]
Oh, look at me and tell me now
If I can be the last one that you think about
Thinking you can keep running out
My life, my life, my life
Why is it's so hard for you to
Pick up the phone and call me
Put a little time in for me
Show that you really care for me
Remember how you used to say
That nothing comes before me
I know, it was a lie because you put your boys before me
Promises, promises made and broken
Still I keep holding on, thinking you would that notice that...

[Chorus]
You got me waiting
You got me waiting
When I'm tellin' everything you need to hear
Like baby, come now
You got me waiting
Boy, I can't keep waiting on you
Actin' like whatever I will always be around
Cause you think that you're something like a pimp
And you can hang in these streets and it will be alright with me
Oh, baby now
You got me waiting
Boy, I can't keep waiting on you

[Verse 3]
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Let me tell me why?
There comes a time in every man's life
When he has to do everything his girl likes
'Cause if he don't choose to play by the rules
I'm sure there's somebody else out there
Who would love to do me, hold me, go the extra mile
Like you did when you was trying to know me
Do me, hold me, treat me nice and show me
All the things you forgot to show me cause

[Chorus]
You got me waiting
You got me waiting
When I'm tellin' everything you need to hear
Like baby, come now
You got me waiting
Boy, I can't keep waiting on you
Actin' like whatever I will always be around
Cause you think that you're something like a pimp
And you can hang in these streets and it will be alright with me
Oh, baby now
You got me waiting
Boy, I can't keep waiting on you
