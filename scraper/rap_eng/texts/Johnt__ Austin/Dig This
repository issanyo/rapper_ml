All the lovers
Gonna get my message
They gonna hear this song
They gonna play this song
They gonna call the station
And request it
Cause it's all about love
Cause you can't find love

Dig this
It ain't about being hard
It ain't about being tough
So represent
Throw it up one time
For the man
Or the woman you love
So if you feel like I feel
Got no problems speaking up
For the one
In your life right now

Dig this
It ain't about being fly
It ain't about being slick
So represent
Ladies
Who ain't love your man
Fellas
Who ain't love your chick
And if you got what I got
Somebody with that good love

In your life right now

Sometimes we get caught up
We don't want
To play ourselves
And live honorable
Ladies you know what I mean
When you got a real nice guy
To please your eye
But you don't wanna tell him
Cause you're afraid
He gonna think you was waitng
What's up with that
Girl don't you know
How hard it is to find a guy
That look good
Got a job, not wasted
And on top of all that
He's straight
You need to be thankful
And show him
That he means
The world to you
Here's what you need to do
Tell him
"Baby you're my king
"And nothing can compare
"To how my life has turned out
"I'm so glad you're here"

Dig this

It ain't about being tough

Sometimes there's so much
We really wanna say
But we let perception
Get in our way
Fellas
You know what I mean
When you got a girl

Who cook and clean
And sexes me
But you don't wanna
Stay true
Cause your afraid
She gonna be
Thinking she with you
Don't you know
How hard it is
To find a chick
That take care
Of her kids, your kids
And still want
To have some more kids
You need to be grateful
And tell your woman
In front of your homies
She's all you need
Say
"Baby you're my queen
"And I would die for you
"There's no other woman
"And I'll always be true"

Don't underestimate
The power of your word
You can tear one down
Build one up
With the power of your word
So why hold it inside
When you can speak
On it tonight
If you got something to say
There's no need to wait
If it hits you like that
And it's real like that
Stop with those games
