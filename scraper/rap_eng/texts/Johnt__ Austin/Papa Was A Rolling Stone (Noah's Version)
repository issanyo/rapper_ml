[Pre-Chorus]
It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember
Yes, I will
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama, I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Mama just hung her head and said, "Son

[Chorus]
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
(And when he died), all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone, my son, yeah
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
(And when he died), all he left us was alone"

[Verse 1]
Hey, mama!
Is it true what they say that papa never worked a day in his life?
And, mama, some bad talk goin' round town sayin' that papa had three outside children and another wife
And that ain't right
Heard them talk papa doing some storefront preachin'
Talked about saving souls and all the time leechin'
Dealing in debt and stealing in the name of the Lord, hey

[Chorus]
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone

[Verse 2]
I heard papa called himself a "Jack Of All Trades"
Tell me is that what sent papa to an early grave?
Folks say papa would beg, borrow and steal
To pay his bills
Hey, mama
Folks say papa was never much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Mama, I'm depending on you
To tell me the truth

[Chorus]
Papa was a rolling stone (well, well, well, well)
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
