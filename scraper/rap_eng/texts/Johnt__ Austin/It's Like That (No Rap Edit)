[Verse 1]
I came to have a party
Open off that Bacardi
Feeling so hot tamale
Boy, I know you watchin' me
So what's it going to be?
Purple taking me higher
I'm lifted and I like it
Boy, you got me inspired
Baby, come and get it
If you're really feelin’ me

[Pre-Chorus]
Because it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leavin’ it all behind
No tears, no time to cry
Just making the most of life

[Chorus]
Everybody is livin’ it up
All the fellows keep lookin’ at us (because)
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinning the cut
It's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)

[Verse 2]
You like this and you know it
Caution, it's so explosive
Them chickens is ash and I'm lotion
Baby, come and get it
Let me give you what you need
It's a special occasion
Mimi's emancipation
A cause for celebration
I ain’t gonna let nobody's drama bother me

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leaving it all behind
No tears (no tears), no time to cry
Just making the most of life

[Chorus]
Everybody is livin’ it up
All the fellows keep lookin’ at us (because)
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinning the cut
It's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)

[Bridge]
'Cause it's my night (it's my, it's my, it's my night)
No stress, no fights
I'm leavin’ it all behind
No tears (no tears), no time to cry
(baby, I’m) Just making the most of life

[Chorus]
Everybody is livin’ it up (I said everybody)
All the fellows keep lookin’ at us (looking’ at us)
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinning the cut
It's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)
This is my night

[Outro]
Let's go now (what), let's go now (what)
Here we go now (what), here we go now (what)
Let's go now (what), let's go now (what)
Here we go now (what), here we go now (what)
