No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt

You should know by now that I really like when you're around
It's so irreplaceable, what we have with you and I
And you should know by now that we belong on each other's team
One of the greatest things that came to be is you and me, you and me
I hope by now you recognize no matter what I'm here for life
You ain't getting rid of me, that is just the bottom line
I think you understand by now we can always work it out
No matter what, I'm down, I'm down

There ain't no doubt that I still love you
No doubt I love you babe, really really love you babe
There ain't no doubt that I still want you
No doubt I want you babe, really really want you babe
Shouldn't be no doubt that I'm here for you
No doubt I'm here for you, really really here for you
I have no doubt about being with you
It's me for you

Thinking back on what I did to cause you so much pain
It was such a silly thing I did to our relationship
But here's something from the heart, I really do apologize
Don't cut me off cause I really love ya
I love ya babe, love ya babe
And I want ya, I want ya babe, want ya babe

Said I'm here for ya, for ya babe, for ya babe
Forever I'm with you, I'm with you

Baby can't you see you belong with me
I'll be here for you so I'm telling you

There ain't no doubt that I still love you
No doubt I love you babe, really really love you babe
There ain't no doubt that I still want you
No doubt I want you babe, really really want you babe
Shouldn't be no doubt that I'm here for you
No doubt I'm here for you, really really here for you
I have no doubt about being with you
It's me for you

(Spoken)
Look baby, I want you to know I love you
And I always will.. don't worry, cause you know...

There ain't no doubt that I still love you
No doubt I love you babe, really really love you babe
There ain't no doubt that I still want you
No doubt I want you babe, really really want you babe
Shouldn't be no doubt that I'm here for you
No doubt I'm here for you, really really here for you
I have no doubt about being with you
It's me for you

No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt... no doubt
You should know
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt
You should know
No doubt, no doubt
