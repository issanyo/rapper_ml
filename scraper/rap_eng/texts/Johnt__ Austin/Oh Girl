[Intro]
It's trouble
Younglord, Ginuwine in the building

[Hook; Ginuwine]
Oh girl (oh girl)
Oh girl you're one of the good ones baby
You're headstrong and gifted baby
You make 'em fiend for more and do things
(Do things, oh girl, girl)
Oh girl you're one of the good ones baby
You make 'em flip they necks and cause scenes
The way that you do things, do things
Oh girl, girl

[Verse 1: GInuwine]
How can I be there just for ya (for ya)
Oh girl, have ya back just like a lawyer (lawyer)
And if something goes wrong it ain't a thing we can work it out
And if dreamin' a thing you'd like to do I'll grant it
Every wish will come true cause you're so hot
If you're up to having friends, oh girl I'm just a dude

[Pre-Chorus: Ginuwine]
I know it seems real strange, just having me walk up to you
I know you're trippin', but the club is packed and I don't want to be...
The one to miss out on something sweet
Cause look at you boo
Sexy as you wanna be, so fly
I want ya right here, right now
Girl I'm feeling you and love the way ya do things, do things

[Hook: Ginuwine]
Oh yeah, you one of the good ones baby
You're headstrong and gifted baby
You make 'em fiend for more and do things, do things
Oh girl, girl
Oh girl you're one of the good ones baby
You make 'em flip they necks and cause scenes
The way that you do things, do things
Oh girl, girl

[Verse 2: Ginuwine]
Your attributes are something exciting
Something like a title bout fight ma
Like the phantom you get attention when you roll, all eyes on you
You shut it all down
Knees, knocks, and mouths drop to the floor now
Things stop cause times up, brothers bow down
Cause you're flawless, no doubt
Ooh all I spit is true

[Pre-Chorus: Ginuwine]
I know it seems real strange, just having me walk up to you
I know you're trippin', but what's in front of me is [?]
And like a [?]. I play around for yeah
East or west y'all that's the big best
Next test is us preps set to take steps
Oh girl I'm diggin' you and the way you do the things that you do
I'm diggin' you

[Hook: Ginuwine]
Oh girl you're one of the good ones baby
You're headstrong and gifted baby
You make 'em fiend for more and do things, do things
Oh girl, girl
Oh girl you're one of the good ones baby
You make 'em flip they necks and cause scenes
The way that you do things, do things
Oh girl

[Bridge: Ginuwine]
Baby I can't help myself
Nah baby I can't help myself ma
I'm falling for ya baby when ya do things
Ya do things, ya do things, ya do things
Mami swing that thing my way
Ain't too much more to say
But that I'm falling and I'm loving how you do things
Ya do things, ya do things, ya do things

[Hook (2x): Ginuwine]
Oh girl
Oh girl you're one of the good ones baby
You're headstrong and gifted baby
You make 'em fiend for more and do things, do things
Oh girl, girl
Oh girl you're one of the good ones baby
You make 'em flip they necks and cause scenes
The way that you do things, do things
Oh girl
