They gone stop this hate
(They don't love us)
Bout to Drive me crazy
(They don't love us)
They gone see the way
(They don't love us)
Steady killin' our babies
They don't love us no

Yeah, black boy sell weed
The white boy snort coke, the white boy go free
The black boy go broke
That's if the black boy see the court
Because usually the black boy gets smoked

In the country that they stole
Now since the boys are close
And the country the black man built
Is the one that wants us killed

Where's the love at?
American Dreaming
All they know is hate
American Dreaming
Make it great again
American Dreaming
It was never great
American Dreaming

This dream is not for all
But for this dream our bids have died
American Dream, American Lives
(Where is the love at, carry the love back
Give me the love back
Where is the love at give me the love back
I want the love back

They gone stop profiling
(They don't love us)
They gone stop mistrialing
(They don't love us)
They gone stop killing nun old folks
And saying they was fearing for they lives
They don't love us no

Yeah
Brown man work hard, the brown man go far, the brown man wash cars
The brown man do labor, that no one else wants
But you believe in the lie that he took your job

That set the world free
To have not since marching in the streets
And the country the black man built
Is the one that wants us killed

Where's the love at?
American Dreaming
All they know is hate
American Dreaming
Make it great again
American Dreaming
It was never great
American Dreaming

This dream is not for all
But for this dream our bids have died
American Dream, American Lives
(Where is the love at, carry the love back
Give me the love back
Where is the love at give me the love back
I want the love back)
