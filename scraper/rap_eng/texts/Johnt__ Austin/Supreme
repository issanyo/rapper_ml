Dream

Dream
This dream

[Verse 1]
Think about it, No doubt about it
I've been there for you, Right from the start
It's not to brag, it's just the facts
Two one of a kinds, that's what we are
And if I were to have my pick of dreams
I would pass the world, pass it in a heartbeat
Just to have this thing
This thing that helps me breathe
To guarantee that that ain't all that bad
As long as I have..

[Chorus]
This dream
I give to you cause you're the biggest part of
This dream
So I tell you I see you and me
Giving love like we'll never need another
Cause this is more than a dream
It's supreme
This dream
I share with you because you have my heart
This dream
So I tell you that I need you
And Im'ma be giving love
Like I'll never need another
Cause this is more than a dream
It's supreme
It's Supreme

[Verse 2]
Can't help but feel it
That's how it is when something is so blissfully appealing
Now that you feel it Oh no
Can't help but want it, to get on it
Before it's gone, even though it's not a moment
More than a dream, and I'll stay every day
But I'll still make you want it
It's life, it's more than meets the eye
It's something that you know
You're fortunate to realize, It's that thing
That thing that helps me breathe
To guarantee that that ain't all that bad
As long as I have

[Chorus]
This dream
I give to you cause you're the biggest part of
This dream
So I tell you I see you and me
Giving love like we'll never need another
Cause this is more than a dream
It's supreme
This dream
I share with you because you have my heart
This dream
So I tell you that I need you
And Im'ma be giving love
Like I'll never need another
Cause this is more than a dream
It's supreme
It's Supreme

[Bridge]
So supreme and incredible baby
You and I together are inseparable, maybe
Young lovers, whipping covers
Not just here but a hundred years from now
Remember it, just tell
I love you more than my own self
And how you love me more than anyone else
And that's good enough for me baby
It's so plain to see that's it more than fantasy
Baby, it's a dream

[Chorus]
This dream
I give to you cause you're the biggest part of
This dream
So I tell you I see you and me
Giving love like we'll never need another
Cause this is more than a dream
It's supreme
This dream
I share with you because you have my heart
This dream
So I tell you that I need you
And Im'ma be giving love
Like I'll never need another
Cause this is more than a dream
It's supreme
It's Supreme
