[Verse 1]
Strangely I feel a connection with you, babe
Oddly enough I crave for it to remain purely
More authentic than I've been used to
Surely this can't be something that's taboo

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you got it like I like it and I feel the need to say
Baby, it's forever and I really mean to
Make you feel as special as I see you, baby
Never have I ever been around someone
Who makes life so free and life so fun
And as crazy as it may sound, I ain't joking, baby

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm in those arms of yours I'm so gone
The things I like can't tell me it's not right
When I'm with you, I lose myself
And no one can make me do what I can't wait to do
When I'm with you

[Verse 2]
Really I get inspired off you, baby, truly I feel alive from you
And you're the only, no one else can duplicate you
I'd leave the one I have, I know, it's sad but damn you

[Pre-Chorus]
Got it like I like it and I feel the need
To say baby, it's forever and I really mean to
Make you feel as special as I see you, baby
Never have I ever been around someone
Who makes life so free and life so fun
And as crazy as it may sound, I ain't joking, baby

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm in those arms of yours I'm so gone
The things I like can't tell me it's not right
When I'm with you I lose myself
And no one can make me do what I can't wait to do
When I'm with you

[Bridge]
The times that we've shared together
Are some of the best times of my life
I wish you were the one I could be with forever
'Cause when I'm with you, I don't want tomorrow to come
And if I had my way, I'd spend every day and night in your arms
So let me lay here and feel what happiness feels like
And wish for it to last because tomorrow it's back to real life
Until then, I'll just keep dreaming

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm in those arms of yours I'm so gone
The things I like can't tell me it's not right
When I'm with you I lose myself
And no one can make me do what I can't wait to do
When I'm with you
