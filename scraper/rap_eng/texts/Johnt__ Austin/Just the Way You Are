How that man, ain't completely happy
With what he has, it's a mystery
Why you try to please him
When you don't need him
It's just as crazy to me

Baby I'm free for you right now, if you have the time
Love to make my mark, such a beautiful mind
Girl it's alright, if you have to go
But before you do, I think that you should know

You don't have to change, you could stay the same
Girl I love you just the way you are
Fine in every way, you don't need a thing
Girl I love you just the way you are
Baby just the way you are

Mind, soul, spirit, got it heart in
Body banging, I'm just saying
Girl I'm going all in
You are what I've been missing
When you speak I'll be listening
To all you have to say

Baby I'm free for you right now, if you have the time
Love to make my mark, such a beautiful mind
Girl it's alright, if you have to go
But before you do, I think that you should know

You don't have to change, you could stay the same
Girl I love you just the way you are
Fine in every way, you don't need a thing
Girl I love you just the way you are
Baby just the way you are

What more do I, have to say
Girl you're perfect, in every way
I'm gonna be there for you, whenever you'll need
Don't worry babe, you won't have to change

You don't have to change, you could stay the same
Girl I love you just the way you are
Fine in every way, you don't need a thing
Girl I love you just the way you are
Baby just the way you are

You don't have to change, you could stay the same
Girl I love you just the way you are
Fine in every way, you don't need a thing
Girl I love you just the way you are
Baby just the way you are
