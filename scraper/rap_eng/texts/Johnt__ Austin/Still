Yeah, yeah
Usually when two people are together
For a long time things seem to change
It's been said that nothing good lasts forever
But this love gets better every day
We get all excited inside
Every time that we get alone
He's still got love in his eyes
And I still got love in my soul

Still and still, feels like the first time we met
That I kissed and I told you I loved you
We still run around like teenagers
Even though we're grown and married with kids
And we still, talk on the phone for hours when I'm away
He still writes letters and sends me flowers every other day
The question everybody asks, is how we make it last
I tell them I still, he still, we still

Now I still smile in the morning
When I realize I'm still in his arms
We know everything about each other
But we still keep holding on yeah
We never gonna break up, we be always there to make up
As long as we stick together we'll climb higher
I'm gonna ride with him to the wire
Our love is never gonna end
We're on fire

Still, feels like the first time we met
That I kissed and I told you I loved you
We still run around like teenagers
Even though we are grown and married with kids
We still, talk on the phone for hours when I'm away
He still writes me letters and sends me flowers every other day
The question everybody asks, is how we make it last
I tell them I still, he still, we still

We go through problems just like everybody else
But I really don't mind, cause it makes us, keep it fresh
Now its sadder than an argument, is the thought we may have never been
He's my lover, my baby's father, my lifetime partner and my friend

Still the man of my dreams
And he's still the man for me
And I'm still in love with him, so deeply
I think I'll sing it again
Still the man of my dreams
And still the man for me
And I'm still in love with him, deeply deeply

Still, feels like the first time we met
That I kissed and I told you I loved you
We still run around like teenagers
Even though we are grown and married with kids
We still, talk on the phone for hours when I'm away
He still writes letters and sends me flowers every other day
The question everybody asks, is how we make it last
I tell them I still, he still, we still
