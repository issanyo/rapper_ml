VERSE 1:
If I were a builder, then you'd have a castle

To rival the highest mountain

And if I were a billionaire, I'd give you every material thing

But unfortunately, all I have to give to you is an imperfect heart

But it's a heart that beats only for you

CHORUS:
Listen to this, girl if you give me one shot

I will love you forever now

No one'll ever do you better now

Love is a risk, but if you give me one shot

I will show you you're the only girl in the world who can

Give me this feeling

Baby, that's how I feel about ya

You're one in a million

I'd rather die than live without ya

We can't miss, so if you give me one shot

We can do it, girl (do it, girl)

I'm talkin' 'bout love in the morning, just like you want it

Anything you need, you can call me for it

VERSE 2:
Now girl I'm only human

I'm full of many faults

I'm guaranteed to fall short

But you'll never hear about me cheating

'Cause I never would betray your trust

No matter what

I will look to you, and only you for love

I'd treat your soul like it was mine

What a privilege for me to breathe your air

Doesn't that say that I care?

(Chorus)
I'm talkin' 'bout all my heart, all my soul

Always stay, never go

BRIDGE:
But unfortunately, all I have to give to you is an imperfect heart

But it's a heart that beats only for you. (Yeeaahh)

(Chorus)
I'm talkin' 'bout every day, every night

The rest of your days, the rest of your life

(Chorus)
