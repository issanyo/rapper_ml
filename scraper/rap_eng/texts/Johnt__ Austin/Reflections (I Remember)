I remember, I remember
I remember, I remember
I remember, I remember
I remember

[Part 1]
Back before the record deal and the cars
And the cribs and the way that things took off
I was signing at Lucy's on 1-25th, just tryin' my best to get on
Back when me and Puff and B.I.G. was kids and I knew Jodeci
I was young and tough and fresh in love and it was all a dream
Signing a contract, no guiding light, just hopin' I
I can get out the projects
And get my family right cause they were my life
In Red Zones, in Bentley's, you can catch me, tryna do me
I was jaded on the block, I coulda faded on the block
But I made it off the block and I

[Hook]
I remember, back when I didn't know which way to feel
I remember, back when pain was all I had to give
The reflections of my life, I see the lessons that I've learned
And now I know, heartbreak don't exist when it's been torn apart by love

[Part 2]
I use to throw a fit, I use to shed a doubt
And blame it on a man but that was Mary than
And this is Mary now, you gotta understand
It's about how we respect ourselves
And the men have no control of our self-esteem
And when we see that then we can let go, oh

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Now I made some mistakes, I lost some friends along the way
But I don't carry it cause it made me a better chick
It's my life and I know that there's more for me to see
(So much more)
I may not be what I'm suppose to
But I can tell you right now, I ain't what I use to be

[Extended Hook]
(I remember) I remember when I didn't know which way to live
(I remember) I remember when pain was all I had to give
The reflections of my life, I see the lessons that I've learned
And now I know, heartbreak don't exist when it's been torn apart by love
(I remember)

I remember, I remember
(I remember) I remember, I remember
The reflections of my life, I see the lessons that I've learned
And now I know, heartbreak don't exist
When it's been torn apart by love, by love
(I remember)

Don't exist no more
(I remember) But I remember, I remember
(I remember) I remember, I remember
(I remember) I remember

I remember
