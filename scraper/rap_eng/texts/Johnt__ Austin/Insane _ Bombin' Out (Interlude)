[Part I: Insane]

[Intro]
Wow
Da Da Da
Da Da Da
Da Da Da
Da Da Da

[Verse 1]
Crying eyes serves as a reminder
Of an all too familiar tale
You and I know it all too well
In morning light, wWe take off all the blinders
And the truth comes rushing in
And we're back to where it ends

[Pre-Chorus]
How could we want something so bad
That's so bad for us
I guess it's one of those things we'll never know, yeah
Some people they tell me, the heart wants what it wants
But I think its just too stupid
To know when it's time to let go

[Chorus]
It's insane
For you to need me
It's so vain for you to try
And it's a shame 'cause i know you're gonna walk away
The minute that I tell a lie
It's insane
For you to come back it's profane to say it's love
Because the only thing sicker than waiting on love that never comes
Is waiting on love that never was

[Interlude]
Da Da Da
Da Da Da
Da Da Da
Da Da Da

[Verse 2]
Sleepless nights remind us that we're human
Aand the streak of sleeping alone
Is not a record that we want to hold
So we say it's alright
If we practice risky judgement
But to keep from being alone
We go back where we don't belong
Oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
How could we want something so bad
That's so bad for us
I guess it's one of those things we'll never know, yeah
Some people they tell me, the heart wants what it wants
But I think its just too stupid
To know when it's time to let go

[Chorus]
It's insane
For you to need me
It's so vain for you to try
And it's a shame 'cause i know you're gonna walk away
The minute that I tell a lie
It's insane
For you to come back it's profane to say it's love
Because the only thing sicker than waiting on love that never comes
Is waiting on love that never was

[Bridge]
So why when I call it quits
Do you turn around and fight for it
And why when you tell me it's lost
Do I fight like never before
I'm trying to forget you
What the hell you know I don't mean the things I say
I just want you to stay with me

[Chorus]
It's insane
For you to need me
It's so vain for you to try
And it's a shame 'cause i know you're gonna walk away
The minute that I tell a lie
It's insane
For you to come back it's profane to say it's love
Because the only thing sicker than waiting on love that never comes
Is waiting on love that never was

[Interlude]
Da Da Da (wow)
Da Da Da
Waiting on love that never was
Da Da Da
Da Da Da

[Outro]
White jacket, lock me up
Four walls baby, I think I'm in love
But is it love? Is this really love?


[Part II : Bombin' Out (Interlude)]
Bombin' out, bombin' out
Park Central ([?], can you hear me?)
Bombin' out, bombin' out
Just let go
Bombin' out, bombin' out
Park Central
