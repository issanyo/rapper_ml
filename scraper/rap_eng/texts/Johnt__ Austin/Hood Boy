[Intro: Fantasia]
Yeah
Ya gotta understand what I'm talkin' about
I'm talkin' about on this one
Sexy
Sexy as hell to me
Yeah
Love
Love

[Verse 1: Fantasia]
So lemme tell ya bout a player I know
Six foot, four
Two twenty five
He's all the way live
See, where I come from
We like 'em like that
He don't talk smack
He just twist caps off
See, that's the only kinda dude I'm demandin'
And every girl like me understand it
And the ones that ain't
They still gotta have it
They don't know why
But they stay chattin'

[Chorus: Fantasia]
I need a hood boy
Wifebeaters and jeans
Always in the trap
And he looks so mean
I need a hood boy
Gon' head pretty
We don't like them there
Need sumthin' mo' realer
I need a hood boy
Hot boys, rock boys
Street boys, B-boys
Man, I love them boys

[Verse 2: Fantasia]
He knows how to treat a lady
But he won't let you get too rowdy
Ooooh, he stands up for himself
That's what I like most about him
He's all I see
And all I need
And all that I want
And all that I'mmm used to
I swear that my man's the truth
(Oooohhh)
I said I swear
That my man's the truth

[Chorus: Fantasia]
I need a hood boy
Wifebeaters and jeans
Always in the trap
And he looks so mean
I need a hood boy
Gon' head pretty
We don't like them there
Need sumthin' mo' realer
I need a hood boy
Hot boys, rock boys
Street boys, B-boys
Man, I love them boys
I need a hood boy
Wifebeaters and jeans
Always in the trap
And he looks so mean
I need a hood boy
Gon' head pretty
We don't like them there
Need sumthin' mo' realer
I need a hood boy
Hot boys, rock boys
Street boys, B-boys
Man, I love them boys

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
B-A-double D-Y stay fly
So fly ever since a nigga started sayin' bye
That's right stand by
'Cause we about to take flight
Not a 747
But the music and the mic-ro-phone home
If you want someone waitin' baby
Go on home
Don't wanna jeopardize  ya safety
Maybe later
We shake the haters and gets busy
You say you wanna do same thing
Then get wit me
If not
Then hit me
I know you know the history
Last nigga ridin' round lookin' real crispy
Ridin' round town, top down on the grizzy
Grind all the time to stay hot or either sizzlin'
I thought I told ya niggas we run stop signs
Cause we don't stop
'Til the cops come knockin' for two block shine
Not mine!

[Chorus: Fantasia]
I need a hood boy
Wifebeaters and jeans
Always in the trap
And he looks so mean
I need a hood boy
Gon' head pretty
We don't like them there
Need sumthin' mo' realer
I need a hood boy
Hot boys, rock boys
Street boys, B-boys
Man, I love them boys

[Outro: Fantasia]
Hey, hey, shortie
Wanna rock with you
Shortie wanna rock with you
Wanna bop with you
I wanna ride with you
