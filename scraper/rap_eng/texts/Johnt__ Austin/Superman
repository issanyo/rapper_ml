Whoa, oh
Oh, yes

You're my super hero, oh, you rock my world
If you show me how I can be your super girl
Give you super, super love 'cause you're super, super hot
Give you more than little bit, give you everything I've got

Do you think of me like I think of you?
Hoping that what I feel is what you're feeling too
And I wanna go through a few things to describe
Just what's in my heart

There is no height that I won't climb
There is no light that I won't shine
There is no time that I won't find
And I'm so glad I found the time tonight

There is no other place that I'd rather be
There is no other face that I'd rather see
The way that you do me is somethin' like a movie
Waking up to you is just like waking up to Superman

It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Superman
I can be your Lois Lane, Superman

There ain't nothing you can't do
I just wanna be with you
And I hope you feel it too
You're my Superman

It's beating in my heart, it's the shaking in my soul
Every time I touch you, baby I go
It's the power of your love, it's the passion in your kiss
That I'm always lookin' for

There ain't no sea that I won't swim
There ain't no void that I can't fill
And there's no time that I won't find
And I'm so glad I found this time tonight

There is no other place that I'd rather be
There is no other face that I'd rather see
The way, do me is somethin' like, movie
Waking up to you is just like waking up to Superman

It's a bird, it's a plane
I say Superman
I can be your Lois Lane
I say Superman

There ain't nothing you can't do
I just wanna be with you
And I hope you feel it too
Superman

Let me touch the sky, please don't hit the brakes
Fly me to the moon, I wanna see heaven's gates
I want to feel what it's like to be with superman
I'll stay by your side and if you take my hand

Then there's no dreams that we can't see
And there's nothing that we can't be
And there's no time that I won't find
And I'm so glad I found the time tonight

There is no other place that I'd rather be
There is no other face that I'd rather see
The way, do me is somethin' like, movie
Waking up to you is just like waking up to Superman

It's a bird, it's a plane
I say Superman
I can be your Lois Lane
I say Superman

There ain't nothing you can't do
I just wanna be with you
And I hope you feel it too
You're my Superman

You're my, my, my, my, my
You're my, my, my, my, my
Superman

You're my, my, my, my
My, my
Superman

You're my, my, my, my, my
You're my, my, my, my, my
Superman

You're my, you're my, you're my
Superman

Man, no
You're so wonderful
