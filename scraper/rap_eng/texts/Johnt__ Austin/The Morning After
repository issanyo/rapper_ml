Hush, don't say a word
Cause I already know what you're thinking, yeah
Things just got more complicated
But we can't fake it
This is real, so let's just go with it

[Chorus]
We became more than just friends
Where do we go from here
After the morning after
I let you in
What's the next move to make
The morning after

Hush, don't say a word
I can't even explain what I'm feeling
Feeling, lying next to you
Ooh feels so good
Don't let the words ruin the moment
Please don't say nothing
I know you might feel guilty babe
Don't let the mind do the speaking
Just let the heart do the leading
Cause we gave each other what we both wanted
Look what we've started

[Chorus]
Baby I can't help but see it
You gave me what I needed
There's no way that I can deny
I love you so
The longer that I'm with you
The more I see that I need you
Let's take what we have and make it last
Forever more

[Chorus: x 2]
