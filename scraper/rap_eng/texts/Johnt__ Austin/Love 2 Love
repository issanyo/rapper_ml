[Verse 1]
We are a couple whose love knows no bounds
And pleasure is doubled whenever you're around
Love is much deeper when you make it like this
And nothing is sweeter when the two are mixed

[Pre-Chorus]
Your kiss has got a poetry
That leaves me shakin' in the knees
Oh baby
And when you join in the action, I can hardly breathe

[Chorus]
Love to love you
I wanna touch you too
Please share my groove, ooh
I don't deny this is the love for me
Wait, don't move
I wanna taste you too
Damn baby, ooh
You both bring me the kinda of joy I need

[Verse 2]
Now when we get on a roll
Sugar, there's no slowing down
You're just like me, so you know
How to make it all come out
And yeah, I can't forget about you, no baby
How you touch, lick, kiss, stroking my love
The way that you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Your kiss has got a poetry
Gets me shakin' in the knees
Ooh baby
And when you join in the action, I can hardly breathe
Damn baby

[Chorus]
Love to love you
I wanna touch you too
Please share my groove, ooh
I don't deny this is the love for me
Wait, don't move
I wanna taste you too
Damn baby, ooh
You both bring me the kinda of joy I need

[Bridge]
Listen
Fantasy, but it's more than just a dream, I am in ecstasy
My wish is to give to you all of the thrills you give to me
Now let me feel all of you
And while I'm feelin', baby
You have your way, make me your slave, I will behave
Play all the games just for you

[Outro]
Love to love you, ha ha ha
And I wanna taste ya
While I'm touching you, baby
I can't wait to feel ya
Love to love you
And I love how you love me too
Yeah
