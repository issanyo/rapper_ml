Verse 1:
Baby I know you love me
Even though you got your own way that you show it
Oooh baby
You gotta trust me
Sometimes it ain't enough to know it
I need to feel it
I need to breathe it
I need you to need it, like I need it
I need us to be
Like I see, ooh I want ya heart
And not just a little bit
Ooh right now I want you all

Chorus:
One Time
I wanna feel the passion
The pleasure
And all that I dream of
One Time
Im tired of all the guessing
I just want to know that I am loved
One Time
I wanna feel specially needed
One Time
Want you to say something and mean it
One Time
It ain't a whole lot to ask
So can you do it one time
Do it one time

Verse 2:
Don't tell it to the others
Bring it to your best friend
I'm not just you lover
Wanna feel like I'm not harassing

When i need simple answer
To the question that I'm asking
This ain't acting
You're the best
Long as you're here I'm blessed
Ain't trying to cause you no stress
I just need a little
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
C'mon baby now you know me
So what you need to do is get up on ya grind
Keep me on ya mind
Day and night

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:
Baby save me
Don't let me be afraid
That this love could slip away
One Time
Baby don't lie to me
Don't say that you gone do it
And then really not gone do it

One time I wanna do
Something we've never done
Let's turn our back on two
And try to work as one

One time, one time, one time, one time, one time

One time, one time, one time, one time, one time

Repeat Chorus 2x
