[Jude]
It's only you
It's only you no one could ever make me change my mind About us together
No matter where I am or how far I'm from where you go
Just know that you are mine and I am yours forever

If you ever get lost, don't worry at all
I'll come for you because your all that matters and were all that matters
When words get in the way know that I care more than a song could ever sang

[Ryan]
I want the best for you
I dream of a life where we both end up more than alright
And if it takes a lifetime then that time is spent by your side

I don't regret it and I don't apologize
I'm doing my part of keeping us together as long as you remember that
I am yours and you are mine forever

[Brittany]
It's only you
It's only you no one could ever make me change my mind About us together
No matter where I am or how far I'm from where you go
I want you to always know

You are my heart

[Jude]
Even when it hurts

[Ryan]
Take my love

[Jude]
When you can't give in return

[Brittany]
We'll risk it all

[Jude]
We will not fail

[Ryan]
And so what if we do

[Together]
Cuz' I'll still have you

[Jude]
If you ever get lost lost lost, don't worry at all
I'll come for you because your all that matters and were all that matters
When words get in the way know that I care more than a song could ever sang
It's only you, it's only you
It's only you
