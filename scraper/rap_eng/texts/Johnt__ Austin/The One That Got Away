(Talking:)
Yo this game is over man
I can't do this no more
Tired of frontin'
Life ain't the same
I miss you
I need you

(Verse 1:)
It's been way too long
Since you up and gone
I'm madder than ever cause you won't pick up the phone
And I'm tired of actin' like I ain't hurtin'
I told you, "you could leave"
I helped you pack your bags
Who knew that when you left
I'd be askin you back
It ain't about my ego cause I hate to lose
But more than that, my heart's been bruised

(Chorus:)
Life's too hard, can't even breathe
Wherever you are, reach out to me
I got this chick, that chick
But it don't matter
Cause I still love the one that got away
And I'm in need of, your kiss and your touch
Girl I'm screaming, I miss you so much
I got this house, this whip
But it don't matter
Cause you're still the one that got away

(Verse 2:)
Do I ever cross your mind?
You know the rest
Try to relax, but I'm stressed
Thoughts of you, keep me pressed
Holdin' hands, stealin' kisses
I'm at the bar, makin' wishes
Now I'm twisted, trippin', tryin' like hell to fix it
Girl I got to get it
Back to the way it was, back to happy times
Back when I was yours, back when you were mine
It ain't about my ego, cause I hate to lose

But more than that, my heart's been bruised

(Chorus:)
Life's too hard, can't even breathe
Wherever you are, reach out to me
I got this chick, that chick
But it don't matter
Cause I still love the one that got away
And I'm in need of, your kiss and your touch
Girl I'm screaming, I miss you so much
I got this house, this whip
But it don't matter
Cause you're still the one that got away

(Verse 3:)
This can't be right
How did I become the reason you ain't at home
I'm out my mind
I don't want to be the reason why I'm alone
I need one more thing
I need one more try
I need one more day
I need one more night
This ain't about my ego, though I hate to lose
But more than that, my heart is bruised
It's been way too long
Since you up and gone
I'm madder than ever cause you won't pick up the phone
And I'm tired of actin' like I ain't hurtin'

(Chorus: x2)
Life's too hard, can't even breathe
Wherever you are, reach out to me
I got this chick, that chick
But it don't matter
Cause I still love the one that got away
And I'm in need of, your kiss and your touch
Girl I'm screaming, I miss you so much
I got this house, this whip
But it don't matter
Cause you're still the one that got away

You Got Away............
