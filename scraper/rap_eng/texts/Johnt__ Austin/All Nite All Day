Ginuwine (Talking):
Wanna ride tonight, Wanna ride tonight
Wanna freak tonight, Wanna freak tonight...
(Repeat)

1st Verse:
The time is cool
Whatcha gonna do
The bachelor
Is calling you, yeah
The mood is right
With the fireside
And the song you like
With your favorite wine

Baby just relax let the atmosphere take over you
Keep it in your mind that I'm here to do what you want me to do
Ain't no need to rush cuz the both of us could go all night
Girl let go and I'll, do you

Chorus:
All nite, and All day
I wanna love you, in every way
Tonight, I wanna play
I can love you baby girl if you stay with me all night
(Repeat)

2nd Verse:
Doing all I can and all you like just to let you know
I got what you need so if you wanna get
Freaky you should be w/ me girl
Baby I'll take care of you, I'll do it nice & slow I can
Feel the heat
When our bodies said I wanna make love tonight
Baby I just wanna do you right
Tell me can we take a ride tonight
Top down with the sounds pumped loud, bodies rollin' round
As we noth go downtown
That's what I like, and it feels so right
Baby open wide, and take it all night
Chorus

Bridge:
I'll treat you right, I'll treat you right if you come to me oh come to me
I'll do you right And all I know is that I gotta have you
Chorus till fade
(See us G's like it wild, and I can make you smile all night)
(Up and down till you leak...Us G's like to freak)
