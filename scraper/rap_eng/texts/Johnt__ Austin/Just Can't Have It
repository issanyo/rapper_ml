[Intro]
Just can't have it, just can't have it
Said I just can't have it, just can't have it
Just can't have it, just can't have it
No I just can't have it, just can't have it

[Verse 1]
It's been about 20 days now
And the truth is that I really miss you, in my life
I heard that bouncing back was easy
But I can't seem to get you off my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that you can't hear me
But I think about you every day
And I have the shortest memory
But I can't forget the pain
That I felt when you when away

[Chorus]
I can't have it both ways
I'm sorry that I said goodbye
People say I did the right thing
But they don't have to cry
I can love you for all the thing that you are
And then hate you for all the things that you're not
I want you to go, I want you to stay
But I can't have it both ways, I can't have it both ways

[Verse 2]
You used to put the S in selfish
Most time the only one you cared for, was yourself
But then you go and put the A in affection
And you could make me forget about everything else

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that you can't hear me
But I think about you every day
And I have the shortest memory
But I can't forget the pain
That I felt when you when away

[Chorus]
I can't have it both ways
I'm sorry that I said goodbye
People say I did the right thing
But they don't have to cry
I can love you for all the thing that you are
And then hate you for all the things that you're not
I want you to go, I want you to stay
But I can't have it both ways, no I can't have it both ways

[Bridge]
Hating, hate is overrated baby
So are all the mistakes we make in life
Just to keep our pride..
I can't have it both ways
I really want it that way, but I love it this way
I can't have it both ways
I can't have it both ways
I really want it
And I love you and hate you
You gone then you stay
I fight you tomorrow but want you today
It's all the same and I just can't have it both ways

[Chorus]
I can't have it both ways
I'm sorry that I said goodbye
People say I did the right thing
But they don't have to cry
I can love you for all the thing that you are
And then hate you for all the things that you're not
I want you to go, I want you to stay
But I can't have it both ways, no I can't have it both ways
I can't have it both ways

[Outro]
Just can't have it, I can't have it both ways
Said I just can't have it, just can't have it
Just can't have it, just can't have it
No I just can't have it, just can't have it
I can't have it both ways
