[Intro]
You changed the game
I like your thug style

[Verse 1]
Hey you, it's me, turn the music down
So you can hear my invitation
La, la, la...
Now what I want you to do is come through to the crib right now
Without hesitation
La la la...

[Verse 2]
So don't ask me what I want
'Cause I want you to hurry up
And get over here and see me
Act just like you need me
Hurry, hurry, hurry
Got ten minutes

[Bridge]
Tick-tock
Where you at?
Looking at my clock, it's about that time
Knock, knock
There you is
I've been waiting on you for a long, long time
Baby, don't stop, stop
I don't mind if you make me hot, hot
Cause I'mma keep your love on lock, lock
Lock ooh (yeah), ohh (yeah)

[Chorus]
You changed the game

When I'm around you
You always make me smile
Ooh, you're so exciting
Come on, don't deny me
Ooh, let's take our time
Ooh, let's do it right

[Verse 3]
Now my parents are gone
And I know youcan't believe its me who needed to see you

Nobody's home, we can kick it all night
I know that you don't have a curfew
La la la... la la la la la la la la la

But don't move too slow
Baby catch the rhythm that I'm giving you
Ooh, I love the rhythm
