Let me say that since that
Since we've been together
Uh, loving you forever
Is all I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Oh baby, let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is alright with me
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Oh baby, let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Good or bad, happy or sad

Why? Oh tell me, why do people break up?
Oh, then turn around and make up
I just came to see
You'd never do that to me or would you baby?
'Cause being around you is all I see

So baby let's, we all that stay together
(Together)
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Hey, uh
(Let's stay together)
Stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Time in need
