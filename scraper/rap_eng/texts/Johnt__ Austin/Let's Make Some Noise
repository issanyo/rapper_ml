[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Welcome to the quiet before the storm
No worries, love
Oh yeah, ain't no pressure
Baby when I'm fuckin' you
The whole world can get tuned out
Like we've been smokin' on that loud
Cloud 9, we on
Both in the zone, yeah
Oh baby, sounds you make when I sllllllrp
Sounds so good, rewind them
Your man callin', decline him
I kill that pussy every time, bang bang
The thing I like about you
Is baby girl you're freaky too
'Til I hear the sirens
All I wanna do is hear that pussy screamin'

[Chorus: R. Kelly + Jhené Aiko]
Let's make some noise
Let's make some noise
We'll be bangin' on the wall
'Til they hear it down the hall
'Til them sirens goin' off
We'll be makin' some noise
We'll be makin' some noise
And I love the noise we're makin'
So let's keep on doin' it, baby

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
Tell me how you feel inside, tell me
I like the way you fill inside
Can you keep it up all night?
I wanna keep this up all night
You know I am down to ride
Cause I like the view from here
Say this pussy is the end all, be all
Riding that thing just like a seesaw all night
You know that I'm small, so baby, break me off
I know you just got off work
But now it's time to get me off
See the thing I like about you
Is baby, you are freaky too
So until we hear them sirens
I'ma be screaming your name

[Chorus: R. Kelly + Jhené Aiko]
Let's make some noise
Let's make some noise
We'll be bangin' on the wall
'Til they hear it down the hall
'Til them sirens goin' off
We'll be makin' some noise
We'll be makin' some noise
And I love the noise we're makin'
So let's keep on doin' it, baby

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Shhh I'm deep off in it, stammering
Got your legs shaking like a tambourine
And I'ma be doing it 'til the morning
When the morning come give you more dick
Feel it, can you take all these inches?
In it, you go from 0 to a hundred when I kiss it
And I know the neighbors gotta hate our guts
Cause we be making all kinds of noises when we fuck
See the thing I like about you
Is baby girl you're freaky too
'Til I hear the sirens
All I wanna do is hear that pussy screamin'

[Chorus: R. Kelly + Jhené Aiko]
Let's make some noise
Let's make some noise
We'll be bangin' on the wall
'Til they hear it down the hall
'Til them sirens goin' off
We'll be makin' some noise
We'll be makin' some noise
And I love the noise we're makin'
Let's keep on doin' it, baby
Let's keep on making these noises
Let's keep on making these noises
Let's keep on making these noises
Let's keep on making these noises
Let's keep on making these noises
