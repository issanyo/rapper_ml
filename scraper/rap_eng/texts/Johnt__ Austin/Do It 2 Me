[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Now you can bounce with me, wit me, wit me
Can you, can you, lean wit it, rock wit it
Can you, can you, can you, do it, do it, do it wit me
Can you, can you, can you bounce wit me, wit me, wit me
Come on

[Verse 1]
It ain't that often but I do get lonely
And I need someone who can pull through
Not anybody when I, I need a solid
My first and only call is to you
Time after time, babe, throughout my life
It's better 'cause ya never have let me down
I need you all night, baby
You know I'll make it alright, so...

[Chorus]
Come do your job tonight
You got me hot tonight
Watch what'cha doing, we ain't moving 'til you get it right
Come on and handle this
Skip all that hit or miss
If you gon' do it, take ya time so you can do it to me (Right)
I need it in slow motion now (Right)
I need you to do it to me, do it to me (Right)
Just a little bit faster now (Right)
Ooh, do it to me, do it to me
There are no boundaries to what we'll do

[Verse 2]
Now that I've laid the foundation
You don't need my direction
Just give me that affection
You know how to serve it
Turn up the music to drown out the screams
If you still hear me, baby, work it out
Don't let it go, don't let it go
Don't let it go
You're the bomb I'm bout to, mmm, let it go
I need you all night, baby
You know I'll make it alright, so...

[Chorus]
Come do your job tonight
You got me hot tonight
Watch what'cha doing, we ain't moving 'til you get it right
Come on and handle this
Skip all that hit or miss
If you gon' do it, take ya time so you can do it to me (Right)
Now won't you move it in a circle now (Right)
Ooh, and do it to me, do it to me (Right)
A little bout for affection now (Right)
Ooh, do it to me, do it to me

Come do your job tonight
You got me hot tonight
Watch what'cha doing, we ain't moving 'til you get it right
Come on and handle this
Skip all that hit or miss
If you gon' do it, take ya time so you can do it to me (Right)
Go a little bit to the left (Right)
Do it to me, do it to me (Right)
Give it everything you got now (Right)
Come on and do it to me, do it to me

With you it's whatever your pleasure is
To give me pleasure that's why I call on you, so...

[Chorus]
Come do your job tonight
You got me hot tonight
Watch what'cha doing, we ain't moving 'til you get it right
Come on and handle this
Skip all that hit or miss
If you gon' do it, take ya time so you can do it to me (Right)
I need a little bit more (Right)
Come on and do it to me, do it to me (Right)
Ooh, take it like it's yours (Right)
Oh, do it to me, do it to me

Come do your job tonight
You got me hot tonight
Watch what'cha doing, we ain't moving 'til you get it right
Come on and handle this
Skip all that hit or miss
If you gon' do it, take ya time so you can do it to me (Right)
(Right)
(RIght)
Do it to me right

[Outro]
With you it's whatever your pleasure is
To give me pleasure that's why I call on you
