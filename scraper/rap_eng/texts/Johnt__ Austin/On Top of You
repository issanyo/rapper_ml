[Verse 1]
Baby you’ve been given feeling to me all night
And I can’t leave unless you're leaving with me tonight
Now it’s not difficult to tell oh baby you're selecting
And I think you're selecting me
To lead you, y llevarte al cielo, baby can’t you see?

[Chorus]
I wanna leave with you gotta take you home
I can see it inside my head (ooh)
That if I leave with you and I get you home
Baby you’re gonne love what I do when I’m on top of you
When I’m on top of you

[Verse 2]
There’s no need for us to see the future tonight
I just wanna live inside this moment all night
No It’s not difficult to tell baby I’m attracted
That’s the way you make me feel
I wanna lead you, y llevarte al cielo baby can't you see

[Chorus]
I wanna leave with you gotta take you home
I can see it inside my head (ooh)
That if I leave with you and I get you home
Baby you’re gonne love what I do when I’m on top of you
When I’m on top of you

[Verse 3]
Something I can’t define
But your eyes tell the story
When my love fills you up
You'll never come down, no you'll never come down

[Chorus]
I wanna leave with you gotta take you home
I can see it inside my head (ooh)
That if I leave with you and I get you home
Baby you’re gonne love what I do
I wanna leave with you gotta take you home
I can see it inside my head (ooh)
That if I leave with you and I get you home
Baby you’re gonne love what I do when I’m on top of you
Baby you’re gonne love what I do when I’m on top of you
