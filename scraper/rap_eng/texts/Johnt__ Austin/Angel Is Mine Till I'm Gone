[Intro]

Said I got, I got
And I love, I love
And I say, I say
Everyday, everyday
Said I got, I got (an angel)
And I love, I love (my angel)
And I say, I say (she's an angel)
Everyday, everyday (she's my angel)


[Verse 1]

Daily, nightly, you are in my world
Words can't, say how, much I need you girl
Still I'd, like to, try and find a few
To paint a, picture, of how I feel for you


[Bridge]

Inspiring, unbelievable, I'm smart enough to know
That only the real, could speak the truth
And I don't lie, baby I need you


[Hook]

So real, I hope you understand the way I feel, inside
So clear, there's only one girl I want right here, in my life
And that's the way I feel about you baby
No lie
I swear that there's an angel missing from heaven, tonight
And the angel is mine
Said I got, I got (an angel)
And I love, I love (my angel)
And I say, I say (she's an angel)
Everyday, everyday (she's my angel)


[Verse 2]

Lying, cheating, I would never dare
I'll be, honest, that's how much I care
For you, I'll give, up the playboy rules
They're overrated, when compared to you


[Bridge]

[Hook]


[Verse 3]

You'll be the real, could speak the truth
And I won't lie, baby I need you
And I only hope, you need me the same
Cause without you, I'm less of a man


[Bridge]

[Outro]

So real, I hope you understand the way I feel, inside
So clear, there's only one girl I want right here, in my life
And that's the way I feel about you baby
No lie
I swear that there's an angel missing from heaven, tonight
And the angel is mine
All mine, all mine, all mine
All mine, all mine, all mine
Said the angel is mine
