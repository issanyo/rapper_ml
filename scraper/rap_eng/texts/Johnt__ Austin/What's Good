Yeah

[Verse 1]
Can I share something with ya ladies (what's that?)
I be on one about my baby (well alright)
That ain't meant for you to get me wrong
I ain't no stranger to love
(now this is different)
I can't put my finger on it
(but it's different) And ooooh...I really want it
'Cause I really dig his swagger
Forgive me if I brag

[Chorus]
It's like a house I never left
Like a fever I wanna catch
Like a mountain that's worth the climb
Talkin' 'bout this man of mine
It's like my money I wanna spend
My homie-lover-friend
He'll be with me 'til the end
And he's never failed me yet
So I give him good lovin' in the mornin' (I got that)
And late in the evenin' (I got that)
And I hold him tight
And I let him know
Daddy, everything is alright
(Now what's good?) I got all the love that he needs
(What's good?) Comin' with it just the way he need it now
(What's good?) Off top, you know it won't stop
He can get all of my love

[Verse 2]
Now the thing that I love the most (What's that?)
Is that he gets what I love the most (Well alright)
He's understanding of all my moods
Knowin' just what to say and do (Yeah)
And yes I am the best and the rest he'll never miss
And yes he's dressed to finesse
What's next is to love, honor, and protect
What's next is just a cause and effect of being so blessed

[Chorus]
It's like a house I never left
Like a fever I wanna catch
Like a mountain that's worth the climb
Talkin' 'bout this man of mine
It's like my money I wanna spend
My homie-lover-friend
He'll be with me 'til the end
And he's never failed me yet
So I give him good lovin' in the mornin' (I got that)
And late in the evenin' (I got that)
And I hold him tight
And I let him know
Daddy, everything is alright
(Now what's good?) I got all the love that he needs
(What's good?) Comin' with it just the way he need it now
(What's good?) Off top, you know it won't stop
He can get all of my love
(Now what's good?)

No, boy, I got that (Now what's good?)
(What's good?) Give it to me baby, oh

[Chorus]
Good lovin' in the mornin' (I got that)
And late in the evenin' (Ooh, I got that)
And I hold him tight
And I let him know
Daddy, everything is alright
(Now what's good?) I got all the love that he needs
(What's good?) Comin' with it just the way he need it now
(What's good?) Off top, you know it won't stop
He can get all of my love
Good lovin' in the mornin' (I got that)
And late in the evenin' (I got that)
And I hold him tight
And I let him know
Daddy, everything is alright
(Now what's good?) I got all the love that he needs
(What's good?) Comin' with it just the way he need it now
(What's good?) Off top, you know it won't stop
He can get all of my love, woo, yeah
(What's good? What's good? What's good?)
