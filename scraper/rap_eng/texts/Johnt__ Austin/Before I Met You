[Intro]
Saw you for you
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)
You changed my life in so many ways  (would you remember, remember, remember, remember)
I just think back to  (would you remember, remember, remember, remember)
How I used to be and how you dealt with me (would you remember, remember, remember, remember)
Just want to thank you


[Verse 1]
Just in case I never see your face again
Just in case the worst was meant to happen
Just in case tomorrow never come, there is something you should know
I've given you every bit of the man I am
I know at times, it wasn't pretty, but it was all I had
I never held back, not one little bit, and the world can attest to this
And baby, you flipped my program upside down

[Chorus]
I was a hustler and player, girl (before I met you)
I'd drink a little something, then hit a little something (before I met you)
But how you made a difference, look what I've been missing
You got my life together and I thank you forever
I really used to throw a lot (before I met you)
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all of that done changed, my game, my frame of mind, you got it right
And I love you for life, girl, I love you for life

[Verse 2]
There was so many times I wasn't there for you
And for everyone of those times, I hated myself for
The way I went about it, the ups and the downs
One foot in, while the other foot's out
Loving on you, loving on another
But I ain't no different from any other brothers
So what I give to you right here, right now
In this here place is my voice, say it out
In this here space, let my heart pour out
As I state my case, as I break it down
To tell you where I'm coming from so you've seen the good you've done
So you've feel the change you've made, stay with me every day

[Chorus]
I was a hustler and player, girl (before I met you)
I'd drink a little something, then hit a little something (before I met you)
But how you made a difference, look what I've been missing
You got my life together and I thank you forever
I really used to throw a lot (before I met you)
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all of that done changed, my game, my frame of mind, you got it right
And I love you for life, girl, I love you for life

[Bridge]
Girl, if I died tonight before I wake
Know that you touched my life in oh so many ways
And sugar, if this song is I had to give, would you remember?
Remember my heart, remember it was good
Remember that I tried as long as I could
Remember that I gave till I had nothing else
Remember my voice

[Chorus]
I was a hustler and player, girl (before I met you)
I'd drink a little something, then hit a little something (before I met you)
But how you made a difference, look what I've been missing
You got my life together and I thank you forever
I really used to throw a lot (before I met you)
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all of that done changed, my game, my frame of mind, you got it right
And I love you for life, girl, I love you for life

[Outro]
Remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
