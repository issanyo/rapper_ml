[Intro]
Hallelujah
Take so long
Oh Lord, take so long
I hope it doesn’t take too long this time
Because I need to be with you, I need to be with you, Lord
Today, today, today, today, today
(Who are you, Lord? Who are you, Lord? Who are you, Lord?
Who are you, Lord?)

[Verse 1: Ryan Destiny, Jude Demorest, Brittany O’Grady]
We breaking news again, Billboard abuse again
Messed up that album date, we back up in this here
Star on a chain, car dipped in candy paint
Fall off? Never, boss up forever, now
Come feel this excellence, this is the best it gets
We can't stop them from whining, but they can't stop us from shining
Got my life and my health, my family is wealth
You would think I got 10 hands, the way I’m feeling myself (Today)

[Chorus: Ryan Destiny, Jude Demorest, Brittany O’Grady]
Ooh
Don’t need that darkness, get it out my space (Ooh)
Lace up those shoes, we on this paper chase
Ooh, yeah
There's something magic about this moment, let's go ahead and own it
I wish I would let these haters get to me
I wish I would spend my time on a petty bitch
I wish I would let ‘em take this energy
I wish I would spend my time on a basic bitch
No, I keep living up, living up, living up this life
Keep on living up, living up, living up this life
Keep on living up, living up, living up this life
Living up this life, keep on living up this life

[Verse 2: Ryan Destiny, Jude Demorest, Brittany O’Grady]
This is that flava talk, this is that paper talk
This is that right on to the real death to the fakers talk
I’m the best you ever had, call me your idol
I came for the bag, I’m leaving with the title, oh
I didn’t come here to lose, you must got me confused
This carte blanche attitude, do what I wanna do
I see you mad as hell, go ahead and tell
But get used to it, ‘cause this future is female (Today)

[Chorus: Ryan Destiny, Jude Demorest, Brittany O’Grady]
Ooh
Don’t need that darkness, get it out my space (Ooh)
Lace up those shoes, we on this paper chase
Ooh, yeah
There's something magic about this moment, let's go ahead and own it
No, I keep living up, living up, living up this life
Keep on living up, living up, living up this life
Keep on living up, living up, living up this life
Living up this life, keep on living up this life
