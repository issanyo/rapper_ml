[Verse 1:]
Its time to make a difference
(I know he's bad right now im feelin like I need him in my life)
I dont wanna leave him
(Cause he's my best friend and me without him I can't see us breaking up)
People said it wouldn't work
I'd end up getting hurt
But what do they know
Because he's my man
I dont care what people say
Cause this feels good to me
And I don't want him to leave

[Chorus:]
Its crazy
Tell me howcome
Something I really want
Is something I love so
Is bad for me
I can't explain it
Its just like a bad habit
I can't shake it
So crazy crazy crazy
I can't believe it
How I need him
He makes a difference
Y'all i'm trippin
Its crazy
Dont know which way to go
Can't let him go
Even though
I know
He ain't the one for me

[Verse 2:]
Stay in some drama
Can't take him home to momma
Ima be honest
He a cold playa
Flirts with every girl that he meets
How he do that to me
How he make it not better
So charmin and clever
He can get whatever
He ask me for what i'm talking about'
Something I can't do without
I can't find the strength to leave
Cause it feel good to me
And I don't want him to leave
Ooh...

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Tonight if this ain't smart
Cause he'll probrobly break my heart
But he's the best thing in a while thats ever happen to me
I dont care what all the other people say
Don't want him to go away
Im hoping that he stays right here with me
Its so crazy
Wooo ohh...

[Chorus: 2x]
