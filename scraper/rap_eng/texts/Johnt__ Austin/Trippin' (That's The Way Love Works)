[Verse 1]
Ain't nobody ever prove their love when
Things were all good and two people are smiling
Love is found way down in the trenches
When he's throwin' a fit
And she's sittin' there crying

[Pre-Chorus]
We tear it up (tear it up)
To patch it up (patch it up)
Break up to make up
The show goes round and round
And that's how we get down
We go back and forth
And anybody who sits through this should know
That what I'm saying's for real
Real love is meant this way

[Chorus]
We say things that we don't mean
And that's the way love works out sometimes
He's trippin', she's trippin'
And we both be trippin', mayne
That's the way love works out sometimes
'Cause when it's on it's on
And you're no longer stressin'
And life teaches a lesson
That love is still a blessing
'Cause when it's all said and done
We're back at square one
And that's the way love works out sometimes

[Verse 2]
What you know about screamin', yellin', cussin' pushin', and rumblin', arguin'
Like it's 12 rounds up inside The Garden
I say, "Where the hell you going?"
And you say, "I'm getting outta here"
And I say, "You ain't going nowhere"
Then I follow you down the stairs
Get in front of you and I scream
Sounds like I'm fussing though you're still the one
And the truth is this is really love
And oh yeah
When I feel like going off, I brush brush all this off
And you know...

[Chorus]
We say things that we don't mean
And that's the way love works out sometimes
He's trippin', she's trippin'
And we both be trippin', mayne
That's the way love works out sometimes
'Cause when it's on it's on
And you're no longer stressin'
And life teaches a lesson
That love is still a blessing
'Cause when it's all said and done
We're back at square one
And that's the way love works out sometimes

[Bridge]
You won't believe it until you see it
(How much you need somebody, need somebody)
And you'll never know how far you'll go
(When you love somebody, love somebody)
Oooh...
(How much you need somebody, need somebody)
(When you love somebody, love somebody)
Sometime we say the craziest things

[Chorus]
We say things that we don't mean
And that's the way love works out sometimes
He's trippin', she's trippin'
And we both be trippin', mayne
That's the way love works out sometimes
'Cause when it's on it's on
And you're no longer stressin'
And life teaches a lesson
That love is still a blessing
'Cause when it's all said and done
It's back to square one
And that's the way love works out sometimes
We say things that we don't mean
And that's the way love works out sometimes
He's trippin', she's trippin'
And we both be trippin', mayne
That's the way love works out sometimes
'Cause when it's on it's on
And you're no longer stressin'
And life teaches a lesson
That love is still a blessing
'Cause when it's all said and done
It's back to square one
And that's the way love works out sometimes

That's the way love works out sometimes
That's the way love works out sometimes
