[Verse 1]
They sleeping, they sleeping
They sleeping, they sleeping on me
But I don’t waste my time
Tryna prove that I’m something to see
Oh I, the real ones they know
And the ones that do not, I don’t need
'Cause most see the vision and I give reasons to believe
That I’m honest, I’m honest, I’m telling no lies
When I say I’m up next, I’m not just for the ride
Never a point when I questioned my mind
Know what I’m doing, I planned for this time
Come up regardless, I’m coming regardless
I’m hungry, I’m starving, remaining a topic
Never an option, got your undivided whenever I’m plotting

[Chorus]
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I don’t want it (na, na, na)
Don’t need it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I don’t want it (na, na, na)
Don’t need it (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I know that you hear this
And you gon' just know that I’m speaking to you
Shouldn’t have got so ahead of yourself
Now you’re losing your cool
I know that you know that I’m right
You admitted that I am the truth
But look you at you now, look at your face
Looking sad in the booth
Signed off a tape,  toured off a tape
Did it alone, and I ain't touched a plate
You was my nigga, we could have been great
You so far gone, got you thinking you're safe
All said and done, you lost my respect
All said and done, you’re the one I regret
Now you gon' watch from the crowd
Lookin' up like the rest

[Chorus]
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal (Look)
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
I need you to promise me one thing
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
That you not gon' take it like that
I don’t want it (na, na, na)
Don’t need it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
(Promise me that you won’t take it)
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
(Swear to me that you won’t take it)
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I don’t want it (na, na, na)
Don’t need it (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Now I could never judge anyone I loved
Even if you lose sight of all the things I’ve done
I’m not who I once was, these days I’m all grown up
I fuck with me heavy, I’m all chose up
And I only did right by you
When you fucked her, I stood right by you
Prayin' for the girls that believe your news
Prayin' for myself 'cause I be all truth
I got good heart, good soul, good sex
No stress, what's next for me is best
Don’t you run your mouth 'cause in this song I say it best

[Chorus]
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I don’t want it (na, na, na)
Don’t need it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I don’t want it (na, na, na)
Don’t need it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
