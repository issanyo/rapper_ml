[Verse 1]
It’s 2 in the mornin’
And I’m through with what I gotta do so
I’m ridin’ through the city
In the old school Chevy Low Pro
Restless than a you know what
Feelin’ sexy than a you know what
Got me textin’ like a you know what
For some of that you know what

[Pre-Chorus]
But you playin’ games
And I ain’t gonna take it
Pick up, pick up
I know that it’s late
And youre faded but baby get up, get up
SOS 911 (mayday, mayday)
Emergency code red (mayday, may)
I know where your spare is for such an occasion
Come through tie up a straight home invasion

[Chorus]
And I’m ring, ring blowin’ up your phone
Got somethin’ you don’t wanna miss
Beep, beep blowin’ on my horn
Your man can't do it like this
Love ya like ya never been loved
Touch ya like ya never been touched
You’re dealin’ wid a real one here
You’re dealin’ wid a real one here
Never gon need another fix
I got everything that you need
Oh you know I run this
Baby just wait and see ah
Love ya like ya never been loved
Touch ya like ya never been touched
You’re dealin’ wid a real one here
You’re dealin’ wid a real one here

[Verse 2]
And the fog is clearin’
A familiar feelin’ as I start to take control of you
The kisses a welcomed addition
Complimentin' me on the whole mission
You like what you’re gettin’
And I love what you givin’
It’s what I’ve been missin’
Everytime with you my spirits are lifted
This time is no different

[Pre-Chorus]
If I keep this up you say you gon scream
But if you keep this up you gon need new sheets
And if we keep this up the neighbors might call the police
But I don’t give a what
Til they get here don’t you freeze

[Chorus]
And I’m ring, ring blowin’ up your phone
Got somethin’ you don’t wanna miss
Beep, beep blowin’ on my horn
Your man can't do it like this
Love ya like ya never been loved
Touch ya like ya never been touched
You’re dealin’ wid a real one here
You’re dealin’ wid a real one here
Never gon need another fix
I got everything that you need
Oh you know I run this
Baby just wait and see ah
Love ya like ya never been loved
Touch ya like ya never been touched
You’re dealin’ wid a real one here
You’re dealin’ wid a real one here

[Bridge]
When I’m in the mood
I pull up
When I want to
I pull up
That’s what I do
I pull up
And when I want you
I pull up
Nobody can love you this good
Love you the way that they should
Nobody but me
I’m the king of your world
Keep it up for me baby be a
Good girl, good girl, good girl

[Chorus]
And I’m ring, ring blowin’ up your phone
Got somethin’ you don’t wanna miss
Beep, beep blowin’ on my horn
Your man can't do it like this
Love ya like ya never been loved
Touch ya like ya never been touched
You’re dealin’ wid a real one here
You’re dealin’ wid a real one here
Never gon need another fix
I got everything that you need
Oh you know I run this
Baby just wait and see ah
Love ya like ya never been loved
Touch ya like ya never been touched
You’re dealin’ wid a real one here
You’re dealin’ wid a real one here
