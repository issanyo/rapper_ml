I, I wanna love ya
I, I wanna love ya

Baby ever since I found you
Seems like everyday I've been happy
See the way you love me
Turns me out, baby I can feel my heart beat
Seems like lately I've been thinkin'
Feelin', that you are everything
Feels like more and more
I'm hoping that you are the only

All I need
All I need
All I need is you
Baby you're everything
Everything
Everything is you
Baby you're all I need
All I need
All I need is you
Baby you're everything
Everything
Everything that's you

Baby usually when you do me
Keepin' me straight
Show me all your lovin'
Baby it is so amazing
Never dreamed I'd be cravin' to be open
Never knew I would realize real love
Always thought it was a joke and
Didn't know it, now I realise and real love
And, baby, I'd been hopin'
That'd you
Stay right here with me
Give me all, give me all
All the love I need
Baby you're all, all I need

All I need
All I need
All I need is you
Baby you're everything
Everything
Everything is you
Baby you're all I need
All I need
All I need is you
Baby you're everything
Everything
Everything that's you

I don't want nobody but you
I don't need nobody but you
Said I don't want nobody but you
Cause I don't love nobody but you

I, I wanna love ya
I, I wanna love ya
I, I wanna love ya
I, I wanna love ya

All I need
All I need
All I need is you
Baby you're everything
Everything
Everything is you
Baby you're all I need
All I need
All I need is you
Baby you're everything
Everything
Everything that's you
