[Intro]
You know what, baby
A lot of things have been going on, you know what I mean?
And I just want us to be together
You understand me, right?
Stay one time for love
Stay, baby
All my life, been dreaming, thinking, wishing, and hoping
For somebody like you, you know what I mean?
Listen

[Verse 1]
I can see beneath the jaded cover
That you're a girl who's stalked for lovin'
So to you I offer all my heart, yeah
Life is confusing, girl, it's true
And I'm not perfect but I do
See us as more then a dream
I'm guessing you feel like me, so...

[Chorus]
Baby, could you stay one time
One time for love
You think about me, dont wanna be without me
And I am all you'll ever need and more
And since I'm in your bed right now
Baby, can I stay one time
One time for love
So I can feel you, and be near you
And if you want my touch then
Baby, can you stay one time for love?

[Verse 2]
Baby, I'm not a foolish man
I can feel something and hold it in
So don't you be a foolish girl
And deny yourself a chance
We both know your worth
If there is a way we'll find
The path that makes our love feel right
But for now, let me meet your needs
And if you feel like me, then...

[Chorus]
Baby, could you stay one time
One time for love
You think about me, dont wanna be without me
And I am all you'll ever need and more
And since I'm in your bed right now
Baby, can I stay one time
One time for love
So I can feel you, and be near you
And if you want my touch then
Baby, can you stay one time for love?

[Bridge]
Now do you hear me
When I say that you're the only one that I need
See, I done had my share of lovers
But none don't come above ya
Now let my body show you what I mean
I hope you hear me
When I say that you're the only one that I need
And since we're here tonight (Hey)
We should make it right (Hey)
And do it one time for love, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, could you stay one time
One time for love
You think about me, dont wanna be without me
And I am all you'll ever need and more
And since I'm in your bed right now
Baby, can I stay one time
One time for love
So I can feel you, and be near you
And if you want my touch then
Baby, can you stay one time for love?

Baby, could you stay one time
One time for love
You think about me, dont wanna be without me
And I am all you'll ever need and more
And since I'm in your bed right now
Baby, can I stay one time
One time for love
So I can feel you, and be near you
And if you want my touch then
Baby, can you stay one time for love?

Baby, could you stay one time
One time for love
You think about me, dont wanna be without me
And I am all you'll ever need and more
And since I'm in your bed right now
Baby, can I stay one time
One time for love
So I can feel you, and be near you
And if you want my touch then
Baby, can you stay one time for love?
