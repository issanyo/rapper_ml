[Verse 1]
Cryin' eyes serves as a reminder
Of an all too familiar town
You and I know it all too well
In mornin' light, we take off all the blinders
And the truth comes rushin' in
And we're back to where it ends

[Pre-Chorus]
How can we want something so bad, that's so bad for us
I guess it's one of those things we'll never know, yeah
Some people they tell me, the heart wants what it wants
But I think it's just too stupid, to know when it's time to let go

[Chorus]
It's insane, for you to need me
It's so vain, for you to try
And it's a shame 'cause I know you're gonna walk away
The minute that I tell a lie
It's insane, for you to come back
It's profane, to say it's love
Because the only thing sicker than waiting on love that never comes
Is waiting on love that never was

Da da da
Da da da
Da da da
Da da da

[Verse 2]
Sleepless nights, remind us that we're human
And the streak of sleepin' alone
Is not a record that we wanna own
So we, say it's alright if we practice risky judgement
And to keep from being alone
We go back where we don't belong, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
How can we want something so bad, that's so bad for us
I guess it's one of those things we'll never know, yeah
Some people they tell me, the heart wants what it wants
But I think it's just too stupid, to know when it's time to let go

[Chorus]
It's insane, for you to need me
It's so vain, for you to try
And it's a shame 'cause I know you're gonna walk away
The minute that I tell a lie
It's insane, for you to come back
It's profane, to say it's love
Because the only thing sicker than waiting on love that never comes
Is waiting on love that never was

[Breakdown]
So why when I call it quits, do you turn around and fight for it
And why when you tell me "It's lost,' do I fight like never before
I'm trying to forget you
What the hell, you know I don't mean the things I say
I just want you to stay, with me

[Chorus]
It's insane, for you to need me
It's so vain, for you to try
And it's a shame 'cause I know you're gonna walk away
The minute that I tell a lie
It's insane, for you to come back
It's profane, to say it's love
Because the only thing sicker than waiting on love that never comes
Is waiting on love that never was

Da da da
Da da da
(Waiting on love that never was)
Da da da
Da da da

[Outro]
Why can't you, lock me out
Four walls, baby I think I'm in love
Is it love
Is this really love
