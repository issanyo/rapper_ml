Did you know... [x7]
That I love you
Did you know... [x4]
And I want you

[Verse 1:]
I'll admit things ain't been the way I thought they would be
Didn't expect so much stress to develop between me and you
I knew that it wasn't easy but sometimes when we fight it don't seems like God's design
But then I hear words you said and I promised I would stand for you and be true throughout the bad and the good
And I know what it means to be committed
So here's a word for you but you just ain't with it

[Chorus:]
Stay down. (We're almost to the very best part)
Stay down. (You'll always be the pride in my heart)
Stay down. (We too can pass the test)
Stay down. (Yeah, we gotta lot of work)
Stay down. (I know it ain't been the best but it certainly ain't been the worst)
Stay down. (The drama will not last forever)
Stay down. (We'll beat it long as we're together)
One day we'll look back on this. (Yeah)
We'll be like "Remember this"? (Remember this)
And it's gonna make us smile. (Make us smile)
Cause in the end we stayed down

[Verse 2:]
I ain't gone lie, at times you amaze me
You be talking and I swear that you're crazy
But I learned a long time ago that pride don't help
It only hurts
And I just want you to know... I need you baby
(I need you)
I'm just like Weezy baby
Not Weezy like a son of baby
But the wife of George and we're moving on up
Ten years strong and we're looking like a plan
I'm looking like your woman and you're looking like my man
We looking like real
And the haters look fake
Especially when they hear me say...

[Chorus:]
Stay down. (We're almost to the very best part)
Stay down. (You'll always have a place in my heart)
Stay down. (We too can pass the test)
Stay down. (You know we gotta lot of work)
Stay down. (I know it ain't been the best but it certainly ain't been the worst)
Stay down. (The drama will not last forever)
Stay down. (We'll beat it long as we're together)
One day we'll look back on this. (One day we'll look back on this
We'll be like "Remember this"? (We'll be like "Remember this"?)
And it's gonna make us smile. (Make us smile)
Cause in the end we stayed down. (Stayed down)

[Bridge:]
Understand you are the one in my heart
(And I'm holding yours so we can't live apart)
When things stop making sense we'll figure it out
(I walked into this and I don't wanna walk out no, no)
(Everything ain't gonna be how we like)
(And what is worth keeping if it didn't take a fight?)
(Your healing is in me and my healing is in you)
(So get your mind right cause here's what we're gonna do)

[Chorus:]
Stay down. (We're almost to the very best part)
Stay down. (You'll always be the pride in my heart)
Stay down. (We too can pass the test)
Stay down. (You know we gotta lot of work)
Stay down. (I know it ain't been the best but it certainly ain't been the worst)
Stay down. (The drama will not last forever)
Stay down. (We'll beat it long as we're together)
One day we'll look back on this. (One day we'll look back on this)
We'll be like "Remember this"? (We'll be like "Remember this"?)
And it's gonna make us smile. (Make us smile)
Cause in the end we stayed down. (Stay down)
Did you know... [x7]
That I...
Did you know... [x8]
