[Chorus:]
Boy you really blow my mind (OH MY GOSH)
I'm just lookin' at you like (OH MY GOSH)
You really got the vibe I like (OH MY GOSH)
The way you comin' at me like (OH MY GOSH)
So what you tryin' to do tonight (OH MY GOSH)
I'll just roll with you tonight (OH MY GOSH)
Cuz the way you talkin' to me
'Bout the way you wanna move me
And the way you puttin' to me is like (OH MY GOSH)

The way that you came up into the spot
Caught my eyes right from the beginning
And before you even said two words to me
I knew that with you I'd be winnin'
I never been around somebody like you before
And no that ain't no lie
Let me get my coat and we can hit the door
And you can take me for a ride

[Chorus]
Now I don't usually fall head over heals
For a cat that I just met
But cha talk like a baller that bigger than life
So I figured I'd take a chance (you make me wanna)
Ride with cha, slide with cha
Drive with cha on the freeway so take it easy
We can rock it all night long
As long as you wanna stay with me baby

[Chorus]
(It's all right; it's just midnight)
So don't you worry 'bout the time just get into it, into it
(Whatever ya like, is whatever I like)
So don't you stop it, don't you stop whatcha doin'
