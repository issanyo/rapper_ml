Ohhh

(Verse 1:)
Three times this same week you been askin' to come to my crib
Girl you got a problem and I know what it is
You done got a little taste of incredible that's got you out of pocketing and you don't know why
And it should come as know surprise
That I got something that blows your mind

(Hook:)
I think it's the way that I move
The things that I do
That's a little different
From the things that you did
When your not here
And that's why your trippin'
I bet he don't

(Chorus:)
I bet he don't give you whatcha need
I bet he don't give you watchu want
Said I bet, said I bet he don't do it like me
That's why you always trying to be alone
I bet he don't kiss ya right
Don't miss you right
Don't handle his like I handle mine
I bet he can't do it like me
No, no, no, no baby

(Verse 2:)
So don't try to fight it
You can't hide it from me, no
What I said, tried to fix
Everyday, you a hit
You can't let it go 'cause your love is so
Now you say your not sprung and any day you'll be through
That's why I got
Five missed calls on my phone
And they all come from you

(Hook:)
I think it's the way that I move
The things that I do
And that's a little different

From the things that you did
When your not here
And that's why your trippin'
I bet he can't

(Chorus:)
I bet he don't give you whatcha need
I bet he don't give you watchu want
Said I bet, said I bet he don't do it like me
That's why you always trying to be alone
I bet he don't kiss ya right
Don't miss you right
Don't handle his like I handle mine
I bet he can't do it like me
No, no, no, no baby

(Bridge:)
Let me say one thing
I know to be true
That he don't understand your body
Quite like I do
And the feeling that you get is so ridiculous
It's hard to quit
Oh, I betcha he

(Chorus:)
I bet he don't give you whatcha need
I bet he don't give you watchu want
Said I bet, said I bet he don't do it like me
That's why you always trying to be alone
I bet he don't kiss ya right
Don't miss you right
Don't handle his like I handle mine
I bet he can't do it like me
No, no, no, no baby
I bet he don't give you whatcha need
I bet he don't give you watchu want
Said I bet, said I bet he don't do it like me
That's why you always trying to be alone
I bet he don't kiss ya right
Don't miss you right
Don't handle his like I handle mine
I bet he can't do it like me
No, no, no, no baby
