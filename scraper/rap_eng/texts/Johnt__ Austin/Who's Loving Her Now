This is real, this is how I feel baby
Check it

She was the kind of girl that I wanted
She was like my homie, my bestfriend
If there was one girl perfect in this world, it would have to be her
She was the kind of girl that I needed
She was off the chain and I mean it
I swear that she was too good to be true
But she love the ground I walk on
In her eyes, I could do no wrong to her
But somewhere along the lines,I started feeling myself
And I got all rude to her
But then one day I went to far and didn't check myself
And I ended up losing her
But now I'm all by myself and can't help myself
Wondering who's loving her

Who's loving her now
Is he treating her right
Is he keeping her satisfied
Who's touching her now
Is he giving her something she can feel
Oh, I wanna know who's loving her now, holding her down
Turning her world around
Who's getting what I been missing
Who's giving her what I wasn't giving

Now I always said real niggas don't trip
So I hopped in my whip, and jumped on the strip
Cos I knew if I really need someone
The girls are lining up
I'd pick 3 and I'd go home
But no matter how many I love
I can't help but wonder if
My girls alone
Can somebody tell me

Who's loving her now
Is he treating her right
Is he keeping her satisfied
Who's touching her now
Is he giving her something she can feel
Oh, I wanna know who's loving her now, holding her down
Turning her world around
Who's getting what I been missing
Who's giving her what I wasn't giving

I was a player and that's how I was living yeah
I know I was out there tricking babe
Taking but never giving it
So many girls would come and go
But none would ever come close, to her
Nobody compares

I ran into her sister the other day
She said she moved out to LA, to start again
Said that she was doing fine, everything was alright
Since she got away from me
Now she was doing better
Better than ever, and never will she come back
I say yeah yeah I learned my lesson
But will you please answer on question

Who's loving her now
Is he treating her right
Is he keeping her satisfied
Who's touching her now
Is he giving her something she can feel
Oh, I wanna know who's loving her now, holding her down
Turning her world around
Who's getting what I been missing
Who's giving her what I wasn't giving
