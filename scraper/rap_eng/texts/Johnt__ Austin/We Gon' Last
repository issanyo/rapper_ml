VERSE 1:
I confess to you what I know to be true, I need you so
Listen up I'm about to say exactly why I feel this way
Let me just collect my thoughts
I've never spoken so true before
But now I'm writing a brand new page
You're the only request that I got in my life, girl
And you never get old and I never get tired, girl

HOOK:
And I know what your friends say
But I don't care what your friends say
'Cause we are something special
And before they speak on us

CHORUS:
You tell your friends (call 'em up)
Make 'em understand
And if they ask (let em know)
Tell 'em I'm your man
And what we got is solid, too hard to break
And we got it; it's too hard to take
Gonna tell everyone that you know we gon' last

VERSE 2:
I can be with you and know one else
Glad to have you to myself
When you're away it's hard to breathe
And when you're here it's hard to see
Can't you tell that we're fortunate that we found a way to clear?
No one holds my interest like you

(CHORUS)

BRIDGE:
I don't need to be reassured
'Cause I know its in my heart that you believe I'm yours
But I don want nobody judging my love
My sincerity or what's inside of me that's for you girl
(Ohhhhhh) Oh baby I need your lovin'
So tell them that you'll stay right here and that you'll never go

(HOOK)

(CHORUS x2)
