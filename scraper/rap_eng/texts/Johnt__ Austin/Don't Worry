Let's try this flow, just follow it, beat it
There's no need for you, baby
It ain't what you think, so don't worry

You remember back in the day
When we thought it was special
When we always stayed down
No matter where we went you'd stay in touch
Two people that were just so in love
Now you probably ain't feelin' much like things
Ain't really been the way they used to be
And you say it seems like I've changed
But I'm still the same

There's no need for you, (to worry 'bout me)
Baby, (don't worry 'bout me, no, no, no)
It ain't what you think, (you still got me)
So don't worry, (don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me)
Even though it seems, (you're losing me)
And things, (ain't what they used to be)
Baby, (I ain't gonna leave)
So don't worry, (don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me)

I was headin' out to Cali, for a show
Told you that on Tuesday I'd be home
Left a message on your voicemail
Sayin' I'd call you later
To inform you I'm alright
Now you callin', just to tell me that you heard
I was seen in a Bentley with my girls
So I'm on my way to a spot where people hang
But nothing's changed

There's no need for you, (to worry 'bout me)
Baby, (don't worry 'bout me, no, no, no)
It ain't what you think, (you still got me)
So don't worry, (don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me)
Even though it seems, (you're losing me)
And things, (ain't what they used to be)
Baby, (I ain't gonna leave)
So don't worry, (don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me)

There's no need for you, (to worry 'bout me)
Baby, (don't worry 'bout me, no, no, no)
It ain't what you think, (you still got me)
So don't worry, (don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me)
Even though it seems, (you're losing me)
And things, (ain't what they used to be)
Baby, (I ain't gonna leave)
So don't worry, (don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me)

There's no need to
Worry 'bout what
I do when I'm away

(Don't worry 'bout a damn thing)
Don't worry 'bout what I do in my time
(Don't worry 'bout a damn thing)
Don't worry 'bout how I do when I put it down
(Don't worry 'bout a damn thing)
Trust in my everything's gonna be alright
(Don't worry 'bout a damn thing)
Gonna work it out, be home tonight

There's no need for you, (to worry 'bout me)
Baby, (don't worry 'bout me, no, no, no)
It ain't what you think, (you still got me)
So don't worry, (don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me)
Even though it seems, (you're losing me)
And things, (ain't what they used to be)
Baby, (I ain't gonna leave)
So don't worry, (don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me)

There's no need for you, (to worry 'bout me)
Baby, (don't worry 'bout me, no, no, no)
It ain't what you think, (you still got me)
So don't worry, (don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me)
Even though it seems, (you're losing me)
And things, (ain't what they used to be)
Baby, (I ain't gonna leave)
So don't worry, (don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me)
