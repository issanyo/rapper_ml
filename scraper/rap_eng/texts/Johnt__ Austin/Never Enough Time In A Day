(Trey)

Another minute's gone and I know it's coming
You about to say "don't go, don't go"
Believe me when I tell you
I wish that there was something
Something I could say
But you know, you know..
Never know how long I'm
Ever gon' be gone
If I could buy a minute then you know that I would spend it with you
Kissing, touching, hugging, making love (making love)

(Johnta Austin)

I wish money could buy me time
I wish I could stay a day through the night
But it's never, never..
I try to say what's going on
But before I know it, you moan and it's gone
Cause it's never, never, never..
I love everything you do
That's why I try to stay with you
And I would if I could but I can't cos she's calling me too
I swear there's never enough time in a day.. no, no

(Trey)

She call me busy busy bee
(Cos I'm) never ever free
(And err'time) I get up in it she begging me not too leave, (no)

(Johnta Austin)

I wish there was some more me
And I didn't have to run shit
I wish there was another me
But there's only one

(Trey)

I just need to pardon me
And why your body's calling me
I check the other line, to find another dime
And she'd never do

(Johnta Austin)

Ain't gonna lie when I'm gone I'm missing you
It's a trip how I live

(Chorus: Johnta Austin)

I wish money could buy me time
I wish I could stay a day through the night
But it's never, never..
I try to say what's going on
But before I know it, you moan and it's gone
Cause it's never, never, never..
I love everything you do
That's why I try to stay with you
And I would if I could but I can't cos she's calling me too
I swear there's never enough time in a day.. no

(Johnta Austin)

In a perfect world we'd chill
But the world ain't perfect cos it's never, never, never
Wanna be in your arms but you know
That I can't so I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take
I'm gonna have to take that pain

(Chorus: Johnta Austin)

I wish money could buy me time
I wish I could stay a day through the night
But it's never, never..
I try to say what's going on
But before I know it, you moan and it's gone
Cause it's never, never, never..
I love everything you do
That's why I try to stay with you
And I would if I could but I can't cos she's calling me too
I swear there's never enough time in a day.. no, no
