[Verse 1]
I feel it, you feel it
That this was meant to be
I know it, you know it
That you were made for me
We can't deny this any longer
Day by day, it's getting stronger
I want it, you want it
It's what the people wanna see
We're like Romeo and Juliet
Families can't divide us
Like the tallest mountain or the widest sea
Nothing's big enough to hide us

[Pre-Chorus]
When we make love, it's overwhelming
I just touch the heavens
You're an angel, you're an angel

[Chorus]
I said this world, this world
Could leave us any day
But my love for you, it will never go away
And I don't wanna go to sleep
'Cause you are like a dream
For every night, I say a prayer
And I swear you are the answer
You're an angel, you're an angel, you're an angel

[Verse 2]
So we take it, and each moment, our love grows
I see it, you see it
What we have is made of gold
We're so filled with meaning
Nothing can make us shallow
So I hold it, and you hold it
The promise of tomorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
When we make love, it's overwhelming
I just touch the heavens
You're an angel, you're an angel

[Chorus]
And I said this world, this world
Could leave us any day
But my love for you, it will never go away
And I don't wanna go to sleep
Cause you are like a dream
For every night, I say a prayer
And I swear you are the answer
You're an angel, you're an angel, you're an angel

[Bridge]
I don't need three wishes
Well, I just need one
For us to never be finished
For us to never be done
When they say it's over
We'll just say "I love you"
And when they say it's finished
We'll just keep on building

[Chorus]
This world, this world
Could leave us any day
But my love for you, it will never go away
And I don't wanna go to sleep
'Cause you are like a dream
For every night, I say a prayer
And I swear you are the answer
And I said this world, this world
Could leave us any day
But my love for you, it will never go away
And I don't wanna go to sleep
'Cause you are like a dream
For every night, I say a prayer
Well, I swear you are the answer

[Outro]
You're an angel, you're an angel, you're an angel
Yes, you are
You're an angel
You're an angel
You're an angel
You're an angel
You're an angel
You're an angel
