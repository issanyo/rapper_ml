I don't even try to fight it
Yes i'm too mature to hide it
All that i feel i can't even explain
But i know not a day goes
I don't go, imma wait for you

But you keep me on an island
At best you're distant and at worst you're hiding
Whats on your mind, baby tell me the time
I try to break though your guard
But its so damn hard child
My heart beats every beat for you
I hurt when you're hurt
I'm blue when you're blue
And i'm fighting but even the greatest of walls withstand

My love is strong
But its weary from the climb
Why can't you help me
Can't you help me please break down your walls
Can you please

Cause i'm holding on
But my spirit gets weary
Oh, i know what it is
It ain't easy, we must break down your walls
But we must break

Love has to fear, please take down your walls
I'll be right here, please break down your walls

You don't prove you're tough by shutting me out
You ain't living alone
But that's the way you carry it
Its dead, so you just bury it
It still hurts, we don't work
And here i am just bearing it all

My, my, my, my, my, my, my
Why, why, why, why won't you
Let me do what a lovers supposed too do
Does it even matter to you that

My heart beats every beat for you
I hurt when you're hurt
I'm blue when you're blue
And i'm fighting but even the greatest of walls withstand
My love is strong
But its weary from the climb
Why can't you help me
Can't you help me please break down your walls
Can you please

Cause i'm holding on
But my spirit gets weary
Oh, i know what it is
It ain't easy, we must break down your walls
But we must break

Love has to fear, please take down your walls
I'll be right here, please break down your walls
