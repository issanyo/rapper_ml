[Verse 1]
You’re bad for me
I clearly get it
I don’t see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
'Cause with every hug and kiss, you’re snatching every bit of strength
That I’m gon' need to fight off the inevitable
And it’s a heart breakin' situation I’m up in, but I can’t control

[Chorus]
You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do, it’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you, I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

[Verse 2]
You ain't right take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait, wait, wait, I’m alive
But how long will it last?
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What’s the prognosis will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down

[Chorus]
Baby
You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do, it’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you, I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

[Bridge]
It’s just not my body (No)
It’s my mind, you don’t know
How many times I told myself
This can't do (Can't do)
And that I don’t need you (No, I don’t need you, no)
It’s so unfair that I find myself right back in your care
And what’s good is that when you’re not always there
(There, there)
You're no good for my health (My health)
You’re just like poison (Whoa, whoa, whoa)

[Chorus]
You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do, it’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you, I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
Baby, kiss me one more time
You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do, it’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you, I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
