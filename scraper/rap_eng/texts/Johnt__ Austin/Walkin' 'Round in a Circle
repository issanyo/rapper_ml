[Verse 1]
Life is a curve ball
Thrown with the wild arm
And if I'm going to swing in, I must get motivated
Instead of lying in my bed
I'm like a train wreck, trucking down a fast hill
Heartbreak is overrated
If I dry the tears now
I can get a head start out the door
I never loved the sun until the rain
I'll never get anywhere if I stay in the same place
Always afraid I'm...

[Pre-Chorus]
Gonna just get stuck in a dream
Where the answer's clear, but no one knows it
It's like a toss up, I gotta get off here
'Cause I'm tired of emotions

[Chorus]
I'm blue no more
Walkin' round in a circle
Déjà vu no more
Walkin' round in a circle

[Verse 2]
Being redundant is never the one trick I ever want to master
One quirk can get me focused
'Cause the start of a circle is also the ending
One door has to close before the next can open
Gotta give my own life
My whole life is a given one sweet goal
I never loved the sun until the rain
I'll never get anywhere if I stay on a same place
Always afraid I'm...

[Pre-Chorus]
Gonna just get stuck in a dream
Where the answer's clear, but no one knows it
It's like a toss up, I gotta get off here
'Cause I'm tired of emotions

[Chorus]
I'm blue no more
Walkin' round in a circle
Déjà vu no more
Walkin' round in a circle

[Verse 3]
How can I be my best, there's never fail
How can I ever find peace if I never yell
I gotta be stronger
I can't let cold wind blow me on a cold night
I follow the skyline and I'm no longer...

[Pre-Chorus]
Gonna  just get stuck in a dream
Where the answer's clear, but no one knows it
It's like a toss up, I gotta get off here
Because I'm tired of emotions

[Chorus]
I'm blue no more
Walkin' round in a circle
Déjà vu no more
Walkin' round in a circle
