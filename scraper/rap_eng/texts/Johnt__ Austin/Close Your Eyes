Hearing me is not enough
Know you want me there instead
What if I came through your speaker
What if I was in your bed?
Rubbing on your back & whispering girl I know your in the mood
For me to soothe it, and move it and show you how I do it
I know you have desires and I can be your fantasy
If you like, I can do it to you sweet or nasty tonight...
So baby close your eyes
When you look at me and imagine me however you wanna think of me
Just like I was naked in your dreams
And you get on top of me
When you want me next to you, girl, all you gotta do is close your eyes
When you look at me, don't it feel like the real thing
Don't it make you wanna scream?
Girl you know you want me kissin on ya, touchin on ya, body tonight
When you want me next to you, girl, all you gotta do is close your eyes
I know you've played this scene over and over again in your head
Well girl I swear if you let me in I'm a break it off, break it off tonight
Girl, flight 15: 45 gonna be taken off... so just let the lights stay on
While I be kissin' on ya body, I can't wait to get my mouth on your pretty little - haha
And hunny if you want to, the way I want to, then all you got to do is close your eyes
When you look at me and imagine me however you wanna think of me
Just like I was naked in your dreams
And you get on top of me
When you want me next to you, girl, all you gotta do is close your eyes
When you look at me, don't it feel like the real thing
Don't it make you wanna scream?
Girl you know you want me kissin on ya, touchin on ya, body tonight
When you want me next to you, girl, all you gotta do is close your eyes
Just lay back and get ready for our rendezvous
Soon as you close your eyes, Girl I'm gonna strip for you
And when I reach the spot you like, I'm a kiss it just right
And do it over & over & over again until I hear you scream
Like prince said I wanna see you cream
I ain't even gonna lie you make ah muh wanna sing
When you look at me and imagine me however you wanna think of me
Just like I was naked in your dreams
And you get on top of me
When you want me next to you, girl, all you gotta do is close your eyes
When you look at me, don't it feel like the real thing
Don't it make you wanna scream?
Girl you know you want me kissin on ya, touchin on ya, body tonight
When you want me next to you, girl, all you gotta do is close your eyes
