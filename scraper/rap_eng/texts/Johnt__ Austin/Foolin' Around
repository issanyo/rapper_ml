[Intro]
I know I vowed to never do this again, but, uh
I guess this seems to be the only thing I'm good at
Got something that you need to know
You're the realest shit I never wrote
Can't hold it, gotta let it go
Know that I mean every note
Yeah, yeah, listen baby

[Verse 1]
Let me start by saying that the way I feel for you has never once changed
And the games I played, mistakes I made leave me sorrier than you'll ever know
We got a problem, baby, I can't lie
'Cause lately, I realize that I
Never knew that we was on the same (playing field)
Knew that it was wrong, but we (let it be)
And I know you never knew when you said I do
That you would have to face all the (pain you feel)

[Chorus]
And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

[Verse 2]
Trade memories for moments, trade love to be lonely
Guess that's just the man in me, blame it on celebrity
When the night time feel like the right time
And that spotlight feel like the right light
When it's really just my fears and I still don't dry your tears
When I say, "She ain't you and I really love you more"
And you say, "If it's true, why you do it for?"
And I, I really don't have no excuse
I break your heart, make you cry, I just wanna say goodbye

[Chorus]
And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

[Bridge]
What I feel, I don't even gotta write it
It's like poison in my body and there's no way to deny
That my heart is a time bomb with seconds left to explode
But I gotta let you know before it blows
That it ain't on you, it's my fault
All the gossip and talk, behind your back when you walk
By the time you will know, before long you will see
That you deserve more, you deserve more
You deserve so much more than what I'm offering

[Chorus]
And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

[Outro]
Live with this
Can you live with this?
I just want you know
Got something that you need to know
This be the realest shit I never wrote, uh
Can't hold it, gotta let it go
Know that I mean every note, yeah
