Every time I go away
You can't stand to see me go
But remember every night and every day
All I think about is home

Then yesterday you called
To say what's on your mind
It's tearing up your heart
Cause we don't spend no time
Baby you gotta realize I feel the same
You say you gotta know
No matter where I go
No matter who I see
No matter who's with me
Baby I'm thinking 'bout you every day

Though I've been gone for so long
And you're looking at someone
She can't kiss you, hug you
Miss you, love you
She ain't gonna love you like I can
So when I'm gone for so long
And you feel like you're alone
Remember she can't move you, do you
Groove you, no
She ain't gonna love you like I can

I try to give you things
So you won't feel this way
But it don't make up
For being face to face
Ooh I need you boy you know I do, oh
Can't nobody make you feel
The way I do, baby I'm so into you
Nobody's gonna love you like I do
And though...

Though I've been gone for so long
And you're looking at someone

She can't kiss you, hug you
Miss you, love you
She ain't gonna love you like I can
So when I'm gone for so long
And you feel like you're alone
Remember she can't move you, do you
Groove you, no
She ain't gonna love you like I can

Baby you should know
Know it by now that
I won't let you go
I'll always be down
Anything you need
You can count on me to be
Boy I love you so, whoa

Look at her, look at me
Think about what you see
Boy you know ain't no way
She's gonna love you like I can

Watch out her, look at me
That's the way it should be
I can't see no one else
Who's gonna love you like I can

Though I've been gone for so long
And you're looking at someone
She can't kiss you, hug you
Miss you, love you
She ain't gonna love you like I can
So when I'm gone for so long
And you feel like you're alone
Remember she can't move you, do you
Groove you, no
She ain't gonna love you like I can
