[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Laying here, all out of ideas
Ain't picked up the phone in so damn long
I got the lights off and I ain't sleep in 'bout a week
You got a man in defeat and that's the picture of me
The last time we spoke, I said goodbye
You had this look on your face, so many tears in your eyes
And I tried to say it was for the best
But now I regret my choice

[Pre-Chorus: Johnta Austin]
And if I had it to do all over
I would find me another way
To express what's on my mind
And try to find me the words I wanna say
And now I'm too hurt to love another
But I'm too proud to ask you back
I don't know if you'll ever get to hear this song
But I needed to tell you that, when I

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
When I first let you go, I ain't know that it would hurt but I miss you
I ain't never had it bad but each day is getting worse 'cause I miss you
Baby, sorry, the things I said and the things I did
If you want to hurry home 'cause I'm sitting here alone 'cause I miss you

[Verse 2: Johnta Austin]
You had heart enough to handle me
But I kept my heart out of reach
Feeling strong enough to carry us
Still I violated every trust
Is it too late I wonder to say I'm sorry?
Too late I wonder to bed your pardon?
All I think about is how I messed it up
And all I think about is how I need ya love

[Pre-Chorus: Johnta Austin]
And if I had it to do all over
I would find me another way
To express what's on my mind
And try to find me the words I wanna say
And now I'm too hurt to love another
But I'm too proud to ask you back
I don't know if you'll ever get to hear this song
But I needed to tell you that, when I

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
When I first let you go, I ain't know that it would hurt but I miss you
I ain't never had it bad but each day is getting worse 'cause I miss you
Baby, sorry, the things I said and the things I did
If you want to hurry home 'cause I'm sitting here alone 'cause I miss you

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
And If I can see you
I'll tell you that I'm sorry
I'll tell you that it's my fault
And I don't wanna be alone
And if I can hold you
I'll love you like I never did before
And then I would love you more
Never ever let you go

[Pre-Chorus: Johnta Austin]
And if I had it to do all over
I would find me another way
To express what's on my mind
And try to find me the words I wanna say
And now I'm too hurt to love another
But I'm too proud to ask you back
I don't know if you'll ever get to hear this song
But I needed to tell you that, when I

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
When I first let you go, I ain't know that it would hurt but I miss you
I ain't never had it bad but each day is getting worse 'cause I miss you
Baby, sorry, the things I said and the things I did
If you want to hurry home 'cause I'm sitting here alone 'cause I miss you
