Intro:
Your grace makes all Saints out of Sinners...

Verse 1:
Guide my heart, hold my hand
As I try to walk the path
So much potential, so many thoughts
Lead me so I don't get lost
But if I get lost, along the way
I need your grace, I need your grace

B-sec:
Something I'm feeling just takes over me
Just wanna give up
Know how it is when you lose everything
Something about your love
Lets me know the story's not over it's just the start
And in my darkest hour, you know my heart

Chorus:
We all need you preachers, deacons, thugs, and drug dealers
Your grace makes all Saints out of Sinners

Verse 2:
Now I've tried my ways
But the way that I need is yours
I look to you when it's all right
I look to you when it's all wrong
Please, remind me when I get low
What you see when you look at me
What you know I can be

B-sec:
Something I'm feeling just takes over me
I just wanna give up
Know how it feels when you lose everything
Something about your love
Lets me know that the story's not over it's just the start
And in my darkest hour, you know my heart

Chorus:
We all need you preachers, deacons, thugs, and drug dealers
Your grace makes all Saints out of Sinners

Bridge:
You said you would never go
So I need you to walk, I need you to talk
I need you to hold me close
Please be my fence, Lord
In those darkest times I see
One set of foot steps
Walking in the sand
I know that you carry me
One thing I know that I'm sure

B-sec:
The story's not over, it's just the start
And in my darkest hours, you know my heart

Chorus:
We all need you preachers, deacons, thugs, and drug dealers
Your grace makes all Saints out of Sinners

Outro:
Your grace, your grace, your grace and mercy
Need your joy
We need your love
Joy, love, peace, Happiness is in you
Only your grace and mercy can see me through
Your grace, your love
Saints & Sinners
All the same until we claim your name
