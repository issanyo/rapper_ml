[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Every time the guns goes blast not a day goes past
I don't miss my dogs, I'm wishing the days could go fast
So I could crash, close my eyes
Try to go to sleep and bring you back
But I can't bring you back, nah can't bring you back
So I back, back memories of us acting bad
Wish time could freeze but our time is up
And I promise ya, I'ma hold it down
'Til it's my time to leave, and I'm okay
I mean, I'm alright, not okay
And it hurts my soul I won't see your face
But if you truly are in a better place
Like what they say, then that's okay
I'll be all right, I've been up all night
Like if I'm di-di-dipping with my nigga
Living with the time tick-tick-tick-ticking away
So forever I'm forever
I'm in search of yesterday (yesterday)
Like a Beatles song, I close my eyes
Repeat the song, tryna bring us back
To where we belong
Middle of the club where B was on, adidas on
Blowing on stank like Cheech and Chong
Going back and forth between Monique and Dawn
So when I meet the Don
You should know I meet back up with my dog when I go
So when time say "Goodbye" we'll say "Hello"

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jermaine Dupri)]
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
(Rock with me MC, come on)

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
And you never got the chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave to me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong
You'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever

[Chorus]
I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on like
"I wish I could talk to you for awhile"
Miss you but I try not to cry
As time goes by
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still I'd give the world to see your face
And I'm right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
The hardest thing to say
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
Bye Bye

[Bridge: Mariah Carey]
This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man, or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We will never say bye (no, no, no)
Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky cause we will never say bye
Bye

[Chorus]
I never knew I could hurt like this (I never knew it)
And everyday life goes on like
"I wish I could talk to you for awhile"
Miss you but I try not to cry (I wish)
(I wish, I wish) As time goes by
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still I'd give the world to see your face
And I'm right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)

[Outro]
It's hard to say bye bye bye bye bye
So come on somebody sing it with me
Wave your hands up high
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
So this is for everybody
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
So just keep your hands to the sky
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
Cause we will never say bye bye
