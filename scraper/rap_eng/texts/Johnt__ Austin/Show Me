[Intro]
You know I've heard every line
No baby, not this time
If you want it like you say you want it
Well, then you gotta

[Verse 1]
When I'm next to you
I get this feeling that maybe I'm willing
To stay next to you
But the thing is playa, you don't like work
And I'm telling you
That nothing is good gonna come that easy
It will never do
And better be ready when you come to me

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I've heard every line
No baby, not this time
If you want it like you say you want it
Well, then you gotta

[Chorus]
Show me
How bad do you want it? How bad do you want it?
Ooh show me
How bad do you need it? How bad do you need it?
Show me
How bad do you want it? How bad do you want it?
Ooh, show me
How bad do you need it?
'Cause actions speak louder than words

[Verse 2]
When you're kissing me
You don't go slow
And it lets me know that you're not listening
When I say that I don't like to rush
So I'ma step back or make you work for it
Fall back and see how bad you want it
You say you're into me
Well, talk is cheap and I

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I've heard every line
No baby, not this time
If you want it like you say you want it
Well, then you gotta

[Chorus]
Show me
How bad do you want it? How bad do you want it?
Ooh show me
How bad do you need it? How bad do you need it?
Show me
How bad do you want it? How bad do you want it?
Ooh, show me
How bad do you need it?
'Cause actions speak louder than words
Show me
How bad do you want it? How bad do you want it?
Ooh show me
How bad do you need it? How bad do you need it?
Show me
How bad do you want it? How bad do you want it?
Ooh, show me
How bad do you need it?
'Cause actions speak louder than words
