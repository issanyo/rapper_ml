[Verse 1: Ryan Destiny]
We took off so fast, so we could find a lane
I never saw you coming, so I never had a plan
Feelings caught first
Turned into a wave
Now, it's good vibes
All day, everyday
Wasn't really looking to be this kind of poppin'
I was lookin' like ya might be
The right kind of problem
And I think about you all of the time
And I can't get you out of my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Destiny]
And this is all new to me
So I don't know everything
But mama told me
You'll know that it's love

[Chorus: Quincy Brown & Ryan Destiny]
When it creeps into yo bones
And it just won't go away
You can't fake this kind of joy
You can't shake this kind of pain
So you let it burn hot
Cause you like it like that
You give it all you got
And you know it comes back
I said it, I meant, I feel it
Can't let it go
Cause you might be the one

[Verse 2: Ryan Destiny]
(You got me)
Got me comin' out of my comfort zone
(You got me)
Got me feelin' like love ain't wrong
You got me pickin' up the phone
Not just textin'
Makin' good love
Baby not just sexin'
And I'm seeing you as a reflectin' of myself
So I'm tryna give me something
Better for myself
And I think that all the time
And I can't get you off of my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Destiny]
And this could be temporary
And I'll admit that it's scary
But mama told me
You'll know that it's love

[Chorus: Quincy Brown & Ryan Destiny]
When you wake up everyday
And it gives you your first breath
Or it makes you so afraid
But you take another step
So you let it burn hot
Cause you like it like that
You give it all you got
And you know it comes back
I said it, I meant, I feel it
Can't let it go
Cause you might be the one

[Bridge: Ryan Destiny]
Is it real? I don't know
But I, I just got to be sure
It's a chance that we won't make it
But it's still a chance that I'm gonna take
And I will know it's love

[Chorus: Quincy Brown, Ryan Destiny, Both]
Would you put it in a song
So the world can catch the vibe
And you play it all night long
Cause it makes you come alive
When peace becomes the truth
And you know that it's okay
And the happiness you feel
You just want it everyday
So you let it burn high
Cause you like it like that
And you give it all you got
Cause you know it comes back
I said it, I meant it, I feel it
Can't let it go
Cause you might be the one
