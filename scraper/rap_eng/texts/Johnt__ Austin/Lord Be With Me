[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I'm workin' every day to keep my hands tight
I hear em talkin' to me tryin' to keep my head right
Red light, hit the brakes before I hit the headlights
A fifth of liquor got me feelin' like the man, right
I'm out here running through the streets, cold feet
And I can hear the voices callin' me and sayin' we should meet
Be discreet, but my inheritance, too arrogant
I guess I should be meek
Verily, verily I tell you the truth
Boy the money make you feel like you the realest one to do it
Them dollas showin signs of my sickness, God is my witness
Turn a sucka to a star, misery to a mistress, Lord
Our Father, hallowed by thy name, keep me from lovin' fame
Actin' thirsty like a lame, trying to change before the change change me
In the Range tryin' to tell myself that I'm the same me
Blame me, not the money

[Hook: Johnta Austin]
Yea, though I walk through the valley, Lord be with me
I'm the streets and the game gettin' at me
So please don't leave me
Tryin' to stay prayed up, still feel hundred
Goin' to live right, but I'm still chasin' money
If temptation didn't feel so good, I would never have a problem
So Lord be with me

I hear em talking to me tryin' to keep my head right
Lord be with me
I can hear the voices callin' me and saying we should meet
Lord be

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Look, I never went on Ashley Madison
But I know some Ashley's and Madison's
I met a few in Texas, met a few in Cali
I coulda made some choices that'd hurt em badly
I coulda made some choices that'd hurt my family
The grace of God kept me outta death valley
I'm talkin' plenty goals, centerfold, plenty oh
See these people cryin', pacify 'em with some pretty clothes
Zero comma zero zero comma zero comma comma
Sign that dotted line and you'll be rich (just give me your soul)
No, no, no don't do it though I'm feelin' kinda foolish
Just another lamb walkin' to the slaughter
Sittin' in a Lamb' with somebody daughter
Boy ya better cool it, hey skip that new addition
I been on a mission, see that devil fishin'
If he baitin' I ain't bitin' I ain't hookin' on his pimpin'
Stay with me Lord

[Hook]

[Bridge: Johnta Austin]

Please stand by your word and don't forget me
Oh, I ain't always right but I'm willin tho
Let it always be you and never me
I know the only way to win is to follow
You led, you lead, Lord be with me

[Hook]
