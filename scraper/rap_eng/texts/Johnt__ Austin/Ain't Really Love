[Verse 1]
Every day I’m tryna get to know ya
But more and more you’re changin’ up your act
Every day I look for ways to bring us closer
But more and more you appear to be drawing back
And baby when we’re makin’ love it’s getting weaker
My heart don’t feel it, feelin’ is everything
And I’m feelin like maybe you just don’t feel it
And I don’t know how to play it
In the past I’d know how to say it
But I

[Chorus]
I held my tongue too long
See how can a man be so cold to a woman
That loves him more (I don’t get it at all)
But if you wanna go there’s the door
I can’t hold ya (boy you’re grown)
You must got me confused, I treat myself way too good
And a love that tears you down ain’t really love

[Verse 2]
Every day I’m gettin’ up and makin’ breakfast
And more and more you’re walkin’ in without a word
And every day I’m tryna ask “baby, what’s wrong?”
And more and more you say I’m getting on your nerves
And then you take me to the level of some bullshit
You say you never had these problems with a white chick
You got me twisted and twisted is just not how I get with it
You need to sit down and hear it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I’m pouring out my heart
Don’t just sit there while my heart is on the line
Speak your truth
What it’s worth
Not a word you say will go unheard
Now if it’s like that then baby just pack your bags
Cause I’m sick and tired of fightin’
Cause I’m sick and tired of tryin’
I had enough of waitin’, I’m not that good with playin’
I know I love you but I love myself too

[Chorus] 2x
