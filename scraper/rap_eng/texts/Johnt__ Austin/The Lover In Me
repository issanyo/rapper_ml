[Verse 1]
Too long I've been
Denying myself
Hostage to thoughts of somebody else
And all the while you
Have been wishing to
Love on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Mixed feelings and misgivings
That's all a memory now baby
When you saw me
For what I could be
Then I finally saw the same

[Chorus]
Now the lover in me
Sees the lover in you
And I'm happy to say that I'm so not afraid
For the lover in me
To meet the lover in you
Cause I see what we'll be
And the lover in me loves you

[Verse 2]
Past it's just that
Leave it where it's at
I want to live in the moment with you
Wasted so much time
Stumbling, but now I'm
Spreading my wings and beginning again

[Pre-Chorus]
Mixed feelings and misgivings
That's all a memory now baby
When you saw me
For what I could be
Then I finally saw the same

[Chorus]
Now the lover in me
Sees the lover in you
And I'm happy to say that I'm so not afraid
For the lover in me
To meet the lover in you
Cause I see what we'll be
And the lover in me loves you

[Bridge]
No tears left to cry
You're my strongest side
So amazing how you've taken me away
Yeah
I'm too far off the ground
So heart don't fail me now
Just let me, oh let me
Feel like I'll never come down

[Chorus]
Now the lover in me
Sees the lover in you
And I'm happy to say that I'm so not afraid (I'm not afraid, no)
For the lover in me
To meet the lover in you
Cause I see what we'll be
And the lover in me loves you
Now the lover in me
Sees the lover in you
And I'm happy to say that I'm so not afraid
For the lover in me
To meet the lover in you
Cause I see what we'll be
And the lover in me loves you
Now the lover in me
Sees the lover in you
And I'm happy to say that I'm so not afraid (no, no)
For the lover in me
To meet the lover in you
Cause I see what we'll be
And the lover in me loves you

[Outro]
Now the lover in me
Sees the lover in you
And I'm happy to say that I'm so not afraid
For the lover in me
To meet the lover in you
