[Intro:]
Oh oh no no
Baby...

[Verse 1:]
It's 3 o'clock in the morning
I figured this call might wake you up
But it can't wait till morning
I'm on my fifth round and I don't care
I'm turnt up so wake up
Oh you, oh you gotta hear me babe
You need to feel me baby
I'm so tired, too tired
All the things you do, I don't know why
I ain't never been tricked like this
But I ain't never been kissed like this
Except by you, by you
I ain't never been loved like this
I ain't never been touched
I ain't never gave a fuck like this

[Pre-Chorus:]
And it just makes me hate and love you more...
I just don't get it baby

[Chorus:]
Don't know why I
Keep on crushing on you babe
Save my loving for you babe
Keep on seeing you, needing you like I do
Cause no one makes me this mad
No one gets me this turned on
But no one makes me this sad
Baby I don't know why I
Keep on falling for you babe
Keep on calling on you babe
Keep on seeing you, needing you like I do
Cause no one else has your touch
No one else has your problem
And no one makes me feel loved like you

[Verse 2:]
When we first started out
Everything was great
Stayed hand in hand even though
We was both like night and day
But when I think back, I'm afraid that
I don't know exactly where at
But you flipped the script
Changed the words, hold up!
It's coming back...
Now I remember clearly
It was a Saturday you came walking in
Tip toeing through the halls
All soft cause you thought I was sleep
And then what's this? (What's this?)
Smelling like perfume I don't wear
Olives on your breath even though
You hate martinis with a twist

[Pre-Chorus:]
And it just makes me hate and love you more...
I just don't get it baby

[Chorus:]
Don't know why I
Keep on crushing on you babe
Save my loving for you babe
Keep on seeing you, needing you like I do
Cause no one makes me this mad
No one gets me this turned on
But no one makes me this sad
Baby I don't know why I
Keep on falling for you babe
Keep on calling on you babe
Keep on seeing you, needing you like I do
Cause no one else has your touch
No one else has your problem
And no one makes me feel loved like you

[Bridge:]
Need you...And I hate it that I need you like I do
Want you...So I love it that I want you like I do
Crave you...And I hate it that I crave you like I do
Love you...So I love it that I love you like I do
Need you...And I hate it that I need you like I do
Want you...So I love it that I want you like I do
Crave you...And I hate it that I crave you like I do
Love you...
I...(don't know why)

[Chorus (Ad-Libs):]
Don't know why I
Keep on crushing on you babe
Save my loving for you babe (I said I don't know why)
Keep on seeing you, needing you like I do (I keep on standing by and you keep on actin foul)
Cause no one makes me this mad (This time you crossed the line)
No one gets me this turned on (Never would've thought you'd put your hands on me, I-)
But no one makes me this sad
Baby I don't know why I (You done lost your fuckin mind)
Keep on falling for you babe (And I'm bout to lose mine)
Keep on calling on you babe
Keep on seeing you, needing you like I do (Cause I love you, love you, love you, love you...but I do)
Cause no one else has your touch (Said I hate you, love you, hate you, love you)
No one else has your problem
And no one makes me feel loved like you (No one makes me feel loved like you)

[Outro:]
Oh no no no no...
