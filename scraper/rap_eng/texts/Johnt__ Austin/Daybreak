[Verse 1]
It's after midnight and everyone's in their room
And I'm just waiting for the lights to go out
But in the mean time, I'm ringin', ringin' your phone
I'm sayin', baby, be patient, I have almost escaped to see you

[Chorus]
When they fall asleep, I'm gonna be free
Hope nobody wants to stay up too late
'Cause I'm sneakin' out to play tonight
Gonna take a taxi ride
Have fun with you, it feels so good I can't wait
Feels like a minute when I'm with you then
The whole thing has to end
Hurry up get back in bed before daybreak

[Verse 2]
I can't stay inside, I know I saw you last night
But it's already been too long
I need to feel your body, the touch of your body
But that's not all, no that's not all
When I'm around your time gets lost

[Chorus]
When they fall asleep I'm gonna be free
Hope nobody wants to stay up too late
'Cause I'm sneakin' out to play tonight
Gonna take a taxi ride
Have fun with you, it feels so good I can't wait
Feels like a minute when I'm with you then
The whole thing has to end
Hurry up get back in bed before daybreak

'Cause I'm sneakin' out to play tonight
Gonna take a taxi ride
Have fun with you, it feels so good I can't wait
Feels like a minute when I'm with you then
The whole thing has to end
Hurry up get back in bed before daybreak

[Bridge]
Sneak down the stairs, get money for the fare
Time is of the essence so I'll tell the driver hurry up
I can't sit still, I'm like a little kid
Smilin' 'cause I'll be in your arms in a minute
Times like this I can't afford to miss
Worth the risk of getting caught just to have your kiss
When I have to go it's the saddest
But I'm so glad to know I'll see you tomorrow

[Chorus]
When they fall asleep I'm gonna be free
Hope nobody wants to stay up too late
'Cause I'm sneakin' out to play tonight
Gonna take a taxi ride
Have fun with you, it feels so good I can't wait
Feels like a minute when I'm with you then
The whole thing has to end
Hurry up get back in bed before daybreak

[Interlude]
I'm sneakin', I'm sneakin', I wanna spend the weekend
Have fun with you it feels so good I can't wait
I'm sneakin', I'm sneakin', ain't happy that I'm leaving

[Chorus]
Hurry up get back in bed before daybreak
'Cause I'm sneakin' out to play tonight
Gonna take a taxi ride
Have fun with you, it feels so good I can't wait
Feels like a minute when I'm with you then
The whole thing has to end
Hurry up get back in bed before daybreak
