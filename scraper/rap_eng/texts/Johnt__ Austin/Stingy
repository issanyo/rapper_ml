You know what baby, I need to tell you something
And.. it's something very important, you know
I want you to take this time out and just listen
And hold me close
You hear me?
Listen

Can I have you for a minute?
Don't get shy cause my hearts in it (when I say)
You got me strung out
I don't know and I can't call it
But whatever it is you've got it (Nah babe)
Without a doubt, yeah
Never been the one to cling
And I don't like to be needed (But now)
I guess that's all changed
That's why I get mad at your folks
'Cuz I don't want you to go (Nah babe)
I want you to stay

[Chorus]
You can say I'm tripping but I'm stingy
And I can't hide it
Wanna keep you all to me
I'm selfish, why try to fight it?
You're the only one, you're the only love
That's strong enough to claim me
So please forgive me I'm just stingy
But how can you blame me?

(Listen) Baby, tell me how you do it
Cause you got me so into it
I'm gone but I don't understand
So amazing, captivating, elevating
Any way you try to put it I wanna be your man
So if you (if you wanna put me on)
I don't mind it's alright, I'm for it
I would so adore it
Nothing turns me on more than being with you
Baby, I'm not trippin'

[Chorus]
You can say I'm tripping but I'm stingy
And I can't hide it
Wanna keep you all to me
I'm selfish, why try to fight it?
You're the only one, you're the only love
That's strong enough to claim me
So please forgive me I'm just stingy
But how can you blame me?

Do what you want
Anything, anything
I am all yours
You can do no wrong (can do no wrong)
Everything, everything
I do because I'm so wide open

No joking, you got me right where you want me to be
I just hope you feel the same cause I don't want nothing to change
This is where I wanna be
So if you wanna put me on
I don't mind it's alright, I'm for it, I would so adore it
Nothing turns me on better than being with you
Baby

[Chorus]
You can say I'm tripping but I'm stingy
And I can't hide it
Wanna keep you all to me
I'm selfish, why try to fight it?
You're the only one, you're the only love
That's strong enough to claim me
So please forgive me I'm just stingy
But how can you blame me?
You can say I'm tripping but I'm stingy
And I can't hide it
Wanna keep you all to me
I'm selfish, why try to fight it?
You're the only one, you're the only love
That's strong enough to claim me
So please forgive me I'm just stingy
But how can you blame me?
