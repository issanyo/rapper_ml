[Intro]
I know you don't believe that it's over like that
You know you still love me
And I love you too
(It's not gonna be our last kiss, last kiss, last kiss)
You know this ain't gonna be our last kiss
(It's not gonna be our last kiss, last kiss, last kiss)
I know you don't believe that it's over like that

[Verse 1]
Feel so empty inside
Since our last kiss goodbye
Picture you in my mind
And I can't seem to rationalize
The way we let it end
It just don't make no sense
This can't be happening
I need you back again
Everybody asking questions
Like we're some kind of obsession
For the millionth time asking, I'm like "Ugh, let it rest"
Can I get a minute to breathe?
They're like, "Nope, what's up with you and so-so?"

[Chorus]
But in my heart, I know this
It ain't gon' be our last kiss
It's too big, we just can't quit
What you think this is?
Our love will always exist
Oh, listen to me
Boy, you know we trill, so stop frontin'
What we got is still something, something
Oh, this feeling, it's too good to miss
And ain't no kiss gon' ever be our last kiss

[Verse 2]
Oh, you said you'd never leave me
So I'll keep believing that eventually
We gon' kiss away the hurt
Do it like it were
And wake up how we used to be
Never let it go, get it right
Bring it back home, stay for life
Call it what you want, it's in your eyes
We gonna make it through, this Iâ€™ll prove it
Something 'bout our love
Will not fade away, always everlasting and...

[Chorus]
In my heart, I know this ain't gon' be our last kiss
It's too big we just can't quit
What you think this is
Our love will always exist
Oh, listen to me
Boy, you know we trill, so stop frontin'
What we got is still something, something
Oh, this feeling it's too good to miss
And ain't no kiss gon' ever be our last kiss

[Bridge]
Baby, I know this, know this, know this
It's not gonna be our last kiss, last kiss, last kiss
It's not gonna be our last kiss, last kiss, last kiss

[Chorus]
In my heart, I know this this ain't gon' be our last kiss
It's too big, we just can't quit
What you think this is?
Our love will always exist
Oh, listen to me
Boy, you know we trill, so stop frontin'
What we got is still something, something
Oh, this feeling it's too good to miss
And ain't no kiss gon' ever be our last kiss
In my heart, I know this this ain't gon' be our last kiss
It's too big, we just can't quit
What you think this is?
Our love will always exist
Oh, listen to me
Boy, you know we trill, so stop frontin'
What we got is still something, something
Oh, this feeling it's too good to miss
And ain't no kiss gon' ever be our last kiss
