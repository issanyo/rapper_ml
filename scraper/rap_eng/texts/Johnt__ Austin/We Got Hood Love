[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Sometimes I don't get a chance to really tell you
But I promise you, my love will never fail you
Don't you get it? Right now, we're writing history
A thousand years from now, they'll talk about you and me
I know sometimes I go hard for no reason at all
Put your soul through the business and test the weight of your heart
'Cause when your back's on the wall and there's a shortage of friends
You know that I'm with you until the end

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
We got hood love, I be fussin', I be screamin' like it's over
Then I'm longin', then I'm fienin' just to hold ya
'Cause that's how we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you
How you feel, love? When I'm with you, never quit you
Now that's real love, when you ain't here, then I miss you
'Cause I still love the way that we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Sometimes I think about leaving you
But when I think about what we've been through, yeah
I get a feeling like it could be the worst
'Cause I've given you my best and I don't mind it, that's fine
'Cause when you love somebody hard, then you'll love that way for life
You got all of my heart and I'll never leave your side
I gave my word to love you all the way 'til the end
So no matter what I'll be right here I'll be right here 'cause

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
We got hood love, I be fussin', I be screamin' like it's over
Then I'm longin', then I'm fienin' just to hold ya
'Cause that's how we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you
How you feel, love? When I'm with you, never quit you
Now that's real love, when you ain't here, then I miss you
'Cause I still love the way that we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you

[Verse 3: Trey Songz & Mary J Blige]
Now I play tough but not for too long
You are someone I depend on
No matter how I act at times, I could never walk away
I thought about it plenty times, but no one could take your place
Well, if there ain't no you, then there ain't no me
And if there ain't no us, then I'd rather be
By myself 'cause no one else
Can know just what I need and really understand me

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & Trey Songz]
We got hood love, I be fussin', I be screamin' like it's over
Then I'm longin', then I'm fienin' just to hold ya
'Cause that's how we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you
How you feel, love? When I'm with you, never quit you
Now that's real love, when you ain't here, then I miss you
'Cause I still love the way that we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you
