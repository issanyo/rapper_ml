[Intro: Johntá Austin]
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Oh, woah, woah

[Verse 1: Johntá Austin]
In the studio, I had to work, but now I’m finished
Call to let you that I’ll be over in a minute
And I’ve been looking forward to this for quite a while, oh
Oh, my darling, you’ve been calling, calling out for me
You’ve expressed all that you wanted, lady, don’t you see?
The timing's perfect and certain I wanna do this urgently, yeah

[Chorus: Johntá Austin]
I'ma make you a woman
Girl, I know that you been patient
And the waiting’s gonna pay off tonight
Watch me make you a woman
Kiss you just the way you need it
Just the place you need it tonight
Gonna hug you with all of my might
You need love and it’s only right
That I make you a woman
So baby, brace yourself
I'ma promise that I’ll love, girl and nobody else

[Verse 2: Johntá Austin]
Girl, I understand that you're nervous (ooh)
And in the back of your mind, you're really hoping that it’s worth it
Let me assure you, I won’t let you down no, no, no
Ain’t no flexing, or no telling, girl, I got your back
You seem like you ready, lady, just relax, oh, oh
This feeling is forever, even better I can tell you that, yeah

[Chorus: Johntá Austin]
I'ma make you a woman
Girl, I know that you been patient
And the waiting’s gonna pay off tonight
Watch me make you a woman
Kiss you just the way you need it

So baby, brace yourself
I'ma promise that I’ll love, girl and nobody else

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Woah, girl, baby, it’s gon' our night
Gonna make it right for you to graduate
But if we can take slow, girl
If you want, let’s take our time, we ain’t in a rush, but please don’t hesitate
So let's play some music softly, whisper in your ear
While I’m rubbing on your body, baby, don’t have no fear
If you down for your man and you like what I’m saying
Girl, let's stop playing, I’m talking 'bout

[Chorus: Johntá Austin]
I'ma make you a woman
Girl, I know that you been patient
And the waiting’s gonna pay off tonight
Watch me make you a woman
Kiss you just the way you need it
Just the place you need it tonight
Gonna hug you with all of my might
You need love and it’s only right
That I make you a woman
So baby, brace yourself
I'ma promise that I’ll love, girl and nobody else
