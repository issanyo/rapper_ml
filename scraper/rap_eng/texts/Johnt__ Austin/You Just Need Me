[Intro]
I made this one for your girlfriend
This one for your girlfriend, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You gave him your love, your love, oh
Showed him something that he never had before
But he didn't want your love, your love, no
So you started over and you're on own
But that ain't so bad, baby you're in luck
'Cause it just so happens that I'm looking for love
So why don't we take a little time?
To see if it's for real, to see if it's right

[Chorus]
You don't need no money tonight
You just need to rock with me tonight
Girl, you don't need no man telling you that you can't
You don't need no one else baby 'cause here I am
You just need me girl, I know just what you need
I got just what you need, and I'll give it to you
I want you to see girl, I know just what you need
I got just what you need and I'll give it to you, you just need me girl

[Verse 2]
To pick you up and show you round
Whenever we up, baby, it's my town
I'm on the way, come on, get up
Took off my sweats and put up the truck
Throw on my Polo, pull out the drive
Step in your heels, put on a top
Get ready

[Chorus]
You don't need no money tonight
You just need to rock with me tonight
Girl, you don't need no man telling you that you can't
You don't need no one else baby 'cause here I am
You just need me girl, I know just what you need
I got just what you need, and I'll give it to you
I want you to see girl, I know just what you need
I got just what you need and I'll give it to you, you just need me girl

[Bridge]
I swear the world stops spinning when you're around
I take my time, every minute to love you down
Give me your smile and girl, forget how he made you frown
Take a chance girl, I'm telling you
That I could be the one for you
I'm gon' do what he can't do girl
Let me be you the one to show you love
Be the only one that you're thinking of
Love is blind so you can't see but you just me

[Chorus]
You just need me girl, I know just what you need
I got just what you need, and I'll give it to you
I want you to see girl, I know just what you need
I got just what you need and I'll give it to you, you just need me girl
You don't need no money tonight
You just need to rock with me tonight
Girl, you don't need no man telling you that you can't
You don't need no one else baby 'cause here I am
You just need me girl, I know just what you need
I got just what you need, and I'll give it to you
I want you to see girl, I know just what you need
I got just what you need and I'll give it to you, you just need me girl
