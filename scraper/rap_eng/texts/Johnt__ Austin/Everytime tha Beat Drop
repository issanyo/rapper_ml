[Intro: Buddie & JD]
Ro-Ro-Ro-Rock then bend my knees
Every time the beat drop
Uh, uh, haha
Ro-Ro-Ro-Rock then bend my knees
Every time the beat drop
So-So Def!

[Verse 1: Pimpin']
You know pimpin' make the beat drop, fuckin' with a laptop
I make em do it do it, as soon as the beat drop
Might throw my towels out like Nick I like to wild out
I'ma stay in the game until I fall out
First I lean grab a ball and then I pop wit it (I pop wit it)
When they bring the mics the crowd I rock wit it (I rock wit it)
I never hittin' licks, trying to get it quick
When the songs come on they, like that's my shit

[Chorus: Monica & Buddie]
I can't help who I'm is, when they play my shh
I just love to dance, every time the beat drop
I love to wild out damn right, shake it all night
Hey, that's my jam, every time the beat drop
I said, ooh, all the ladies in the club grab a dude
And you work it real slow, you can do it
Move it, 'til you make him lose it
Ro-Ro-Ro-Rock then bend my knees
Every time the beat drop
He gon' be a fan, every time the beat drop

[Verse 2: Monica]
I know you used to seeing Mo laid back
So for the most part you think I'm like that (dig this)
You about to get a glimpse of the fit
I'm giving niggas on the floor, man
When I hit the door, man
'Cause I ain't one of these too boogie broads
Always in the club holding up the wall (now dig this)
You about to get a taste of the way
That we do it down here in the A
Let me say

[Chorus: Monica & Buddie]
I can't help who I'm is, when they play my shh
I just love to dance, every time the beat drop
I love to wild out damn right, shake it all night
Hey, that's my jam, every time the beat drop
I said, ooh, all the ladies in the club grab a dude
And you work it real slow, you can do it
Move it, 'til you make him lose it
Ro-Ro-Ro-Rock then bend my knees
Every time the beat drop
He gon' be a fan, every time the beat drop

[Verse 3: Monica]
Now I ain't talking bout a little two step (Whatcha talkin' about?)
I'm talking bout some that'll make you sweat
And when I talk well I'm through talking
I'm about to do some move some let you see something
When I say get gutta it's enough said
Do the bounce like you over on Bank head
And if anybody got a problem with the way you doin you
Look em dead in the face and you say

[Chorus: Monica & Buddie]
I can't help who I'm is, when they play my shh
I just love to dance, every time the beat drop
I love to wild out damn right, shake it all night
Hey, that's my jam, every time the beat drop
I said, ooh, all the ladies in the club grab a dude
And you work it real slow, you can do it
Move it, 'til you make him lose it
Ro-Ro-Ro-Rock then bend my knees
Every time the beat drop
He gon' be a fan, every time the beat drop

[Verse 4: Jizzal Man]
I trick stats like candles and I blow that money
I'm drunk off the goose so I throw that money
I spendin' white T cash, yea that throwback money
When I step off in this spot like I know that's money
And my chain so styling, how colors diamonds you need, man?
I bow low we, you wanna bow low in the week-end
Damn! And you ain't fresh azimiz
It's DFB, bitch, and I can, I can

[Chorus: Monica & Buddie]
I can't help who I'm is, when they play my shh
I just love to dance, every time the beat drop
I love to wild out damn right, shake it all night
Hey, that's my jam, every time the beat drop
I said, ooh, all the ladies in the club grab a dude
And you work it real slow, you can do it
Move it, 'til you make him lose it
Ro-Ro-Ro-Rock then bend my knees
Every time the beat drop
He gon' be a fan, every time the beat drop

Y'all know what this is
DFB, Monica
Every time the beat drop
Let's get it
Every time the beat drop
