Verse 1:
I wrote a song. Wanna hear it, hear it go
The perfect melody is my head
I got a song that's meant for one thing
I got the candles lit i'm rocking my
Lapearla fit and pouring a glass of champagne
Si i've been planning the right time for me to tell you baby
But that's better if i show ya
Forget the radio cause i already wrote

I wrote this song this song specifically to make love to you boy all night long night long
There'll Be no hesitation on my part i wrote
I wrote this song this song specifically to make love to you boy all night long night long
There'll Be no hesitation on my part i wrote

Verse 2:

Forget about deangelo how does it feel boy i already wrote. Ooh

I wrote this song this song specifically to make love to you boy all night long night long
There'll Be no hesitation on my part i wrote
I wrote this song this song specifically to make love to you boy all night long night long
