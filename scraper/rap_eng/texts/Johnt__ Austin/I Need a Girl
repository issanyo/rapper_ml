[Intro]
Shawty where you at?
Shawty where you at?
Shawty where you at?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
It gets lonely in this business, need a homue who's the realest
Someone who wants to find out all that I have to give
Who can bring me what is missing, when I talk, she wanna listen
Sitting patient, steady waiting for the day when I can face it

[Pre-Chorus]
The one that can love me for, who I am and so much more
Is it you? You my Bonnie
Say that I, I found the one
I ain't gonna rest 'til I know for sure, so

[Chorus]
Baby, please believe me when I tell you that, I need a girl, need a girl
So come on pretty lady won't you holla back? I need a girl, I'ma tell you what I need
I need a girl that's gon' be my baby, so if you love me say "I'm your baby"
So fine I go "That's my baby", so if you need me say "You're my baby"

[Verse 2]
I'm a good man, who ain't got a lot to ask, just looking for something I can build on
I'm a young man, with a whole lotta cash, just looking for a lady I can spend on
So all the young ladies in every little city when I come to your town, let me know that you down
Sitting patient, steady waiting for the day when I can face it

[Pre-Chorus]
The one that can love me for, who I am and so much more
Is it you? You my Bonnie
Say that I, I found the one
I ain't gonna rest 'til I know for sure, so

[Chorus]
Baby, please believe me when I tell you that, I need a girl, need a girl
So come on pretty lady won't you holla back? I need a girl, I'ma tell you what I need
I need a girl that's gon' be my baby, so if you love me say "I'm your baby"
So fine I go "That's my baby", so if you need me say "You're my baby"

[Bridge]
You could, be my everything
Oh you mean so much to me and I don't even know your name
But I know that, that I'm your man and you are my girl
And if I ever meet ya, I'ma give ya the world, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, please believe me when I tell you that, I need a girl, need a girl
So come on pretty lady won't you holla back? I need a girl, I'ma tell you what I need
I need a girl that's gon' be my baby, so if you love me say "I'm your baby"
So fine I go "That's my baby", so if you need me say "You're my baby"
Baby, please believe me when I tell you that, I need a girl, need a girl
So come on pretty lady won't you holla back? I need a girl, I'ma tell you what I need
I need a girl that's gon' be my baby, so if you love me say "I'm your baby"
So fine I go "That's my baby", so if you need me say "You're my baby"

[Outro]
