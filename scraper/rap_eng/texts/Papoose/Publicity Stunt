[Intro]
Publicity stunt. Drop!

[Main Verse]
You coulda caught him on the back street and semi'd him up
But you caught him on front street really to front
What type of reputation do you idiots want
Stop pullin' them publicity stunts (reputation)
You really wanna leave your enemies slumped
Or you pullin' a publicity stunt (reputation)
You gonna be drinkin' out my hennessy cup
When I pour it for the niggas who ain't here
Publicity stunt

They pullin' publicity stunts I hear these niggas
They tryin' to sound like me I hear these niggas
Yea I hear these niggas but I don't feel 'em tho
Ever violate Thug-A-Cation I kill 'em slow
Yeah we move around with those things, niggas know
Ask the streets man I locked it down from the gitty-go
Niggas talk 'bout they looking for us, here we go
Go 'head pop off and get shot like a video
I eat food, right now you look like cereal
Frosted flakes, rice krispies and cheerios
Got all of these rappers walkin' 'round on they tippy toes
I got an illy flow
I'mma tell you like my niggas in the Bronx say it
I get busy mo
He claiming he ain't running when I'm letting that semi go
I bet you he run when I bag that milly tho
I make a nigga haul ass like Aresenio
Cop the bottle pop the bottle and let the henny flow
I'm feeling kinda windy tho
Somebody must've let the window open
There's flies on my thrown
Shoo fly shoo the king is now home
Roaches crawling on my microphone
Mosquitoes they biting my poems
Fresh from summer jam I'm back in my zone
I'm about to exterminate you clones
You telling me you need to blow you deserve to fail
People in hell need ice water
I come out a thirsty hell
They don't believe hard work prevail
They rather start controversy 'cuz they say controversy sells
That's the reason 60 niggas is locked in 30 cells
Making 10 dollars a week they working jail
Bloodshed erupts when controversies fail
So easy to dig a grave the earth is frail
Count dirty money so I keep dirty nails
No evidence don't leave a dirty trail
They like a bunch of crabs in a barrel when they see one leavin'
They pull him back down 'cuz none of em wanna see him
Rise to the top they feel like he gonna leave 'em
So they gotta stop em from achieving
Rappers fighting over the summer but the summer's just a season
I stand for a cause and go to war for a reason
Wise maneuvers 'cuz I grew up on the block with shooters
I don't bow down to no man I'm not a Buddhist
You looking for an opportunity to stop the truest
I won't give you an opportunity you opportunist
Tote crazy calico's and proper ruggers
Cock pop you losers
Back out betsy and put one in her head
You gonna lose your life pa
'Cuz my bullets stay in betsy like a life guard
Put one in betsy head
Hit all y'all niggas up
'Cuz my bullets stay in betsy head like swimming trunks
My Brownsville niggas feel that
They know what's up
Call me out and I'm showin' up

'Cuz I run up with the oowhop baby shootout crazy you not crazy duck
We pull out 80s move out lady you got shady love
That dude got sprayed move y'all ladies dudes out now may be tough
But these dudes obey these moves I say they move our way we bust
Get thru my day I move my yay get moola lately what
It's the truth I can't be touched
I sit back and roll 2 dutches 'cuz my crew got crazy blunts
I roll a double dutch like
1 my baby 2 my baby jump
You gon' be drinking out my hennessy cup
When I pour it for the niggas who ain't here
Publicity stunt!
