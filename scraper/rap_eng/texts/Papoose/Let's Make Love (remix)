[R. Kelly Talkin]

[Hook - R. Kelly]
They way we roll up it ain't hard to tell
Ladies, it's Deep Side and ya boy Kells
Got the, swagga on wit the jewelry swingin
Them chicks be faintin cuz them boys be singin
Wooh!

[Verse 1 - Deep Side]
Oh girl dont you see im on a mission
Tryna see the ass assumin the position
Baby ima drive, know you wanna ride
Just relax and ur ready for a good time
When ur in my bedroom just get naked
Girl, them clothes is outta fashion
Let me release ya tension, lickin on ya neck n
Now i got ya ready for some action
Now she standin over top of me
Dancin all freaky, talkin bout this

Hopin that she show me
Now ya see im gettin horny so...

[Chorus]
Let's make love (Let's make love)
Let's make love, right now

Sayin boo, what ya got for me

Ya wanna get closer
Girl the night ain't over

So ima gonna turn ya out till ya want more
You be wrappin ya legs around me
Squeezin my body tightly
Ya won't be able to stop the shakin
All because this love we're makin
