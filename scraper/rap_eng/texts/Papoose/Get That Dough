[Hook: Keith Sweat]
I gotta get that dough
I gotta stack up on my chips
Put a shine up on my wrist
I'm a hustler babe
I gotta get that dough
You be calling me, calling me
I gotta get that dough
I gotta brush up on my pimp game
Stay up on my feet man
I gotta get that dough
You be calling me, calling me

[Verse 1: Papoose]
My house lavish luxurious outlandish
Enough crack to make the east coast 'bout vanish
Enough chronic to keep the west coast counting cabbage
Enough bread to make the whole dirty south a sandwich
Claiming you got money what's you account balance?
Industry nigga, I get fly without a style
My doormat reads welcome to Papoose palace
Your text bracket is mad kelvish
You got a nice crib, but I laugh when I pass you
Cribs is for babies man, I live in a castle
A kingdom stand on my throne in a threesome
Me, myself and I enjoying my freedom
On fire from Head of New England
So when you pass me, you pass a fire like babies when they teeth in
The mafia kids, we push you off with the forearms
The only thing you can kiss is the ground that I root on

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Papoose]
They mad at my money cause I don't wanna trick it
They say they gonna fix you be more specific
Why you gonna fix me, life's short live it
You know they say, if it ain't broke don't fix it
I'm so ahead of my time I eat lunch for breakfast
Put on my medallion before I put on my necklace
The game mean, I gain green like infections
I could teach you the game boy just like Tetris
I let your girl drive my car, shawty bog
She was DWI: driving while in love
She say she wanted to go clubing roll a budge
Jacuzzi up in the telly we can rubber dub, she in love with my buzz
I told her the hotel was like an ace of spade: it's better than the club
What you mean you made me I helped you put weight on
The only thing you can make is the bed that I lay on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Papoose]
Money be calling me "Hello can I speak to Pap?"
I'm on the other line with money I call you back
Dollar bills be saying, yo Pap' get your chips up
Ball me up in the night, and spend me in the strip club
5 dollar bills be saying spend me at the (?)
Let 'em keep the change them punk cops broke
10 dollar bills saying stay on your grind
To get your hands on me you had to move dimes
20 dollar bills be saying dig gully
Dressed that ugly hoodies and ressing
50 dollar bills be saying display
So we can smoke for days, sticky sacks of haze
100 dollar bills is ignorant
Cause they was filling their selves
It's big may all about the Benjamins
Plastic talk too, Pap watch out
Keep a safe Uncle Sam might freeze your account

[Hook]

[Outro: Keith Sweat]
I gotta get that dough
I gotta stack up on my chips
Put a shine up on my wrist
I'm a hustler babe
