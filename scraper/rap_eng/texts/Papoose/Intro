Bloomberg wanna change New York gun laws
Rockefeller fucked up all of the drug laws
Alot of people hating on artists from up north
City at a stand still I'm here to unpause
Hometown haters don't support oppose
Them out of town niggas come through and get sucked off
They ask how I knock my stuff off
I tell 'em niggas everyday I'm hustlin
Like a I'm a young Ross
Never been tough you was cut from one cloth
It must have been velvet cause you dumb soft
Can't squash beef once a nigga get bumped off
You're sweeter than duck sauce
I couldn't give a fuck if you lost love
Once a couple shots get bust off
We lost blood and you said it ain't no love lust
Your man said it's dead so you taking your gloves off
Your man can't tell me what to do that's your boss
Cheerleader it's cold so I keep a hand heater
My quarter water pussy change in your man meter
Take me I promise you you can't beat us
You club pop up I bring the chopper up the amnesia
You not strapped but you claim you're holding
So when shit pop off you be laying frozen
Then you wanna claim everything that's rolley
Living off my fame so your fame is stolen
You playing kid games and in game we growing
Put shame in the game so the game exposed her
The things that you claim it's insane I told her
So shut your kid playing man this things is chosen
You hate what you ain't controlling
You a scumbag, your mother should've named you Trojan
I got my weight up they was talking Unity I
But when they had me running star they had me ruger me stop
Perpetuating frauds claiming that we poo when we not
Like I ain't hear your stories when you got your jewelry pop
They call you by your first name you cool with these cops
You never feel the high one, but you soon to be shot
Since I was 16 man I used to shoot on these blocks
Duba duba we had the whole community locked
So when I started buzzing they already knew we was hot
Open them doors and the opportunity knock
I show my son the knowledge so he understand daddy
I teach my girl the wisdom so she make her man happy
My baby girl got my eyes she be starring at me
I let her know I'm too young to be a gran daddy
Man my wisdom is strong I could lift a carone
Quick as the glitch of a star drift as the ways of a lock
As I sit with the gods I see you sit with the frauds
Scripture my songs to show how dangerous these instruments are
You can hit with the drums, man a rhythm is hard
The high hemic you high flesh you can hear the guitars
My brain cells is jail ink pen is the yard
Such a prison with bars I got some visits to mom
You brag about getting head from a chick ass minor
You don't brag about ruining that vagina diner
Lyrically inclined, spiritually divine
Mentally designed to leave you blind
It was meant for me to rise balistikally I grind
Third eye, trilogy the eyes epidemy wise
All you women beating guys is quick to meet demise
Could meet the mister meet the crimes
Just to see you dine
I'm pulling mm's 9's physically I'm fine
I got my weight up in that chimp you niggas seeing size
Throw nigga be inside to pick the bee behind
I'm seriously surprised you killing me you guys
Try dissing me at times but victory was mine
Backstabbing motherfuckers sticking me with knives
All your trickery and lies with misery combined
No history of mine can't finish this without
