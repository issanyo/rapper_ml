[Verse 1: Papoose]
Obama care's here, we can take a deep breath now
Politcian stressed out, Government shut down
We don't care, we aren't boxed up in your political square
Now everybody say, Range Rover, west bound
Drove through a whole crowd
Motorcycle rider paralyzed from the waist down
That's not fair, we got an injustice this everywhere
Now everybody say, shots out in Washington
A soldier fired all of them
Had psychological problems, but they ignored em‚ùú
Man I swear, Im'a keep all of ya'll in my prayers
Now everybody say
When you catch a case your stash turn into lawyer fees
Can't cry over spilled milk, it gets spoiled, G
In the industry it's no loyalty
How can you be royal, your record label is takin' all your royalties?
