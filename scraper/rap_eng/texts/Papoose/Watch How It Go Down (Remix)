[Intro: Premier talking]
Primo. Yo, what up Term'? You know we had to do it. Remix, remix. Guess who?
"Watch how it go down" - M.O.P. 'World Famous'
First family

[Verse One: Lil' Fame]
Soon as the beat drop, your heart beat (STOP!)
The heat pop, it's M dot O dot P (DOT!)
This ain't hip hop
(It's Mo P hop!)
The streets hot
We in the building like sheet rock
Haters can eat a cock
Anyway, enough about ch'all, fuck cha'll
Let's talk about me
I can't stop, I won't stop
I'm too strong plus it's all fucked up without me
I'm the baby of a Kingsboro alchie
(Jamal Grinnage!)
I'm the baby of despot
(Trini.!)
T.N.T. I'm half hard dough bread, half Inver House Green
Anyway, enough about me, fuck me
Duke let's talk about ch'all
We done ran through gay crews and squads
I got my compact disc pushed back
But I can bet yo' ass this
I ain't never got my shit pushed back
It's the world's most dangerous
M (Blonk!) O (Blonk!) P (Oooh!)
With Termanology and Primo
Motherfucker

"Kick back and watch how it go down" - M.O.P. 'World Famous'
"Streets crazy wild plus it get crazy foul
Listen when I say it now" - Termanology 'Watch How It Go Down'
"Watch how it go down!"

[Verse Two: Termanology]
Yo
I see myself as the holy resurrection of rap
I rise souls how I'm bringing it back
Listen, a little Makaveli, I'm smoking on lots of cherry
And thinking on plots to bury, my enemies out to get me
I'd rather just sign a deal then gripping the pine and steel
Or flipping and find a kill and sitting in county jail
They dying to prosecute me, illegally stop and scoop me
If not then these cops will shoot me
And popped on my top are Gucci
The secret Illuminati is crooked as Giuliani
As long as my crew behind me
I'm keeping it truly army
We starting revolution, a pivotal evolution
A lyrical execution, Puerto Rock rebel shooting
A Che Guevara with bling on, I sing songs
For my people locked in the bing long, you've been strong
Keep your eyes open and your mind elevated
Hit the law library, spend your time educated
It's Termanology

"Bring 'em over here"
Primo
"Watch how it go down!"
"Bring it back to the east"
Papoose
Pap-oose
"Watch how it go down!"

[Verse Three: Papoose]
My support system is New York wisdom
I tuck the four fifth in
Don't get caught slippin
Yeah we all winning
Cause I make the city look good when it was dead
Just like a mortician
I hear 'em all riffing
But I shoot guns like directors shoot movies
Who wanna audition?
Before you talk, listen
These rappers is blind like the shades in the window
I got a strong vision
And I hear 'em all spitting
But they ass backwards like the Detroit Knicks
And the New York Pistons
I neglect all ignorance
Inject a long clip in to protect all women
They keep the world spinning
Yeah we all chilling
This what you call living
Got it locked like Elmira you never saw prison
Look in the mirror
You reflect poor image
The game is sour cause you niggas all lemons
