This is our bump in the road
There's no where to go, no no
You made your choice

Place, BK, what's the occasion?
Party around the wait
You DJin, of course K-slate
Your favorite day of the week, payday

You fuckin wit me hold on, ay ay
She my sister like Brandy and Ray-J
Whats the name of your clique, thug-a-thug-acation
Thats not a gang, it's an organization

How many awards u won, bout a deuce
What's your name fool, Papoose, Pa Poose
The industry ain't prepared for us
They ask questions, ain't understandin us

We be rappin over tracks that they scared to touch
Came to my show, everybodies hands was up
He was hidin in the basement, I was tearin it up
Told Sn?? now I'm callin your bluff, "Hello"

Whenever you call me, I'll be there
Whenever you want me, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
I'll be around

So I'm like Scarface, I'm sittin the the jaccuzi
One hand on my dick, other hand on my uzi
Shorty blockin the TV wit her booty
Whatchin the 50 flick, them bootleggers sold me the movie

I'll be givin the grand for cheap usely
But tell em lil niggas gonna pawn their jewelry
It's the cash, yall know what this is, throw me the stash
The words that I spoke unto light show me the path

Them other ghetto gave me a gun, told me to blast

Learn to pass master my mack ?? to flash
It's the Nas ??, a dream, the dream of life
I payed the price, spent through my nights, I need the light

Cops hold the keys to your chains, and read your rights
It's hard to get your mind to believe your life
This struggle keep me feelin doom, hopin these clouds will clear the moon
I heal the wounds, give my kids the silver spoon

This is a our bump in the road
There's no where to go, no no
You made your choice

Streets, we was entertainment, stay on the rise
Old dogg behind me slay on my side
We don't stop for nutin, we stay on the grind
Every Wednesday, catch us on Shade 45

Every Thursday, catch us on live Hot 9
You can call me, my number 5-9 nevermind
Niggas say I'm light in the ass, I say whatever
I weigh as much pounds as Floyd Mayweather

Listen homie I hit the bag, let's get together
I run these Mc's like I'm tougher than leather
You really think your artist nice, he on the brink
Of becomin the next nigga, he your weak link

Put him next to me, if that's what you think
I make him look like shit, that nigga stink
They havin battles with the Jackets??, I'm gonna creep
Sayin yeah you better watch out for me with the mix, never call me

Whenever you call me, I'll be there
Whenever you want me, I'll be there
Even if I have to call, I'll be there
I'll be around
