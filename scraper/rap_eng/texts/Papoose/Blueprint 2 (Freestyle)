Welcome to the epitomy of rap, yo

All the gangsters keep asking me when you comin' out
East coast rappers ain't doin' no numbers, what's that about?
They doin' numbers on the west and numbers on the south
But I deal with mathematics so I figured this out
DJ's having countdowns, but they can't count
Papoose is number one, cocksucker watch your mouth
Police pulled me over they told me my shit expired
I know why they really pulled me over, them niggas biased
The ladder of success is stretched to get up higher
Could be the best if you possess what is required
Everybody tryin' to wash they money, get it quiet
Cause man it's the same laundromat, different dryer
Cops run in your crib, they ain't even get invited
Man I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
You see your man who work for your enemy, skip the violence
Make his worker work for you, nigga try it
Why would I see my enemy's peasant and get excited
When I could walk right in the kingdom and hit your highness
Get killed for speakin' the truth, I'm spittin' fire
Cause I'd rather be the dead truth than a livin' liar
And I don't want to do no features, a nigga tired
I eat so many niggas up man I got niggeritis
Don't come to the platinum party, my shit is private
Cause I'm about to get more plaques than gingivitis
Gang bangers spread it like a disease, caught meningitis
Lay sick with the B's and C's like Hepatitis
If bringin' outsiders to the hood is your desire
You be responsible for him or get retired
Every time we turn around, seem like this kid behind us
This nigga got a screw loose, hand me some bigger pliers
He asked me where he could get some iron
I told him go to the hardware store, I don't know if that nigga wired
If I know you I'll loan you a gun, I can't provide it
Bring my gun back, I'll give you your money back, nigga buy it
He lost my tre pound, said he stashed it on a tire
And he ain't see the car pull off, this kid's a riot
And he lost my fourth pound, he can't deny it
This nigga made me lose more pounds than a fuckin' diet
