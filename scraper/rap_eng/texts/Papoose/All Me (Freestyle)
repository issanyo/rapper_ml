You’re not the king nigga, I’m the king
‘Cus I let it ring on the spot
I don’t even know why all them other lames on yo job
They should stop, fuck that mind yo business and get shot
Want my spot back ‘cus I…

[Hook]
Killed Versace, that’s all me
Dreams and nightmares, all me
Control, that’s all me
Next stop Brownsville
Summer Jam, that’s all me
Open Letter, that’s all me
New York, that’s all me
Best stop Brownsville

[Verse]
Yo tough guy, you get 86
I broke the rules and they can’t be fixed
Keep fuckin around, you gon make me rich
I shoot pointblank range, can’t make me miss
My lady ain’t afraid of shit
You know how much money I done made with Chris
Desert Eagle might break my wrist
I’m a living legend like Jadakiss
Ain’t no snitchin over on this side
Yall bust at us then we bust at yall
We don’t give a fuck if yo clique die
Goddamn. Should I listen to everybody or myself?
‘Cus myself just told me Pap you the king of the city
The champ, you don’t need no belt
Blastin' Techs, bulletproof across my chest
You just suckin on that breast
You’ve been breastfed by the press
Media telling the world you the best
I’m the brownskin Malcolm X
By any means necessary I’m legendary like Malik, you better show respect
Look just understand that them corners cold, it get hot as hell
I’m in the streets with all of this shit
And I’m on the road but still poppin shells, I call beefin all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my blatant grammar
Don’t fuckin move or I blaze the hammer
Keep the hawk like ball play in Atlanta
Run up on your video, shoe take the camera, goddamn
