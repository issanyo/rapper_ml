[Notorious BIG sample]
"Remember Rappin Duke? duh-ha, duh-ha"

[Verse 1]
I got the Yankee hat, nice
Just like Eminem
With Shady Rap
Psycho world-warriors
Mentally wild maniacs
Nut-case anonymous
Barbaric but braniac
Homicidal predicate
Headbusters be grazing past
Straight-jacket warriors
Customers coppin crazy crack
Movin like Kimora Lee Simmons be movin Baby Phat
Loan shark
I give you forty, you owe me eighty stacks
You gon wear cement shoes if you don't pay me back
I do it B.I.G, just like a gravy rap
Look at how I'm killin these niggas usin the lazy rap
Lame niggas wanna bring everything from the eighties back
But they ain't bringin fear ones back
Crazy wack
Weed give me lazy eyes
Like the Tracy McGrady cat
The tires pump up on they own if the Mercedes flat
Soldiers who suit up in fatigues when they attack
Desert Storm colors; brown, white, beige, and black

[Hook]
Yall niggas is funny
Laughin at these niggas
Yall niggas is funny

[Verse 2]
Bringin the second verse in
Last of a dying breed of determined men
Provin that the third eye is able to watch the earth spin
Bringin order to this unlawful, fraudulent jerk trend
Of gangsters takin losses to cowards who don't deserve wins
Crack pipe residue, dope needles and burnt stems
Wheelchair addicts with prosthetic, dispersed limbs
Burnin buildings
Back in my youth, I lost my first friend
His father set the family on fire
He just turned ten
Latter 6 fire department came and burst in
Too late, paramedics carried him out with burnt skin
Appeals court eggin him, and he's second the bill turnt in
Three-time loser he praying he get his first win
Stick up kid saga continues
I put in work Slim
Waitin on the jooks, we heard you bringin them birds in
Homie on the run for defendin another person
Put out a reward, he called the precinct and turned him in

[Hook]
