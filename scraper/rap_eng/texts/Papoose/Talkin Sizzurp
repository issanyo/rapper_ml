Riziv the pistol twizzle yo wizzle yo hizzer
Fo shizzle nizzle Papizzle gizzle exquizzer
Prozzerp bizzerp sir burb sapizzer
Smokin some hizzerb and sippin on some sizzurp


I've got gangster love, gimme love like a G
Cause I spit out the odds and you get cut like key
These roch ass rappers biting a thug like a flee
Cause I gotta (bzzzzzzzz) buzz like a bee
Lonely last nigga I ain't these phoney ass niggas
Frontin like Couter Contaise with they tobey ass niggas
Whats your head price, is it worth more than a dead life
Cross million you double cross like the dead Christ
Bet I trade and bet her twice
I shake on the bullets in row 4, 5 or 6 in the barrel, dead dice
My last play at heights turned into a lead pipe
Told stay still, he tried to play real fled right
I put the info red to his head tight
Then I just gave him a death summons for runnin the info red light
Know what we would, shit pop off, don't know what he would do
Papoose cocked it deathin and blow illegal
Infa red dots in yo face it goes measles
And raid flows great blows make dos leave dude
Straight chrome, k tone, make thrown, break bones
Waste bone, face bone, take thrown, they clone feeble
Break yo A-hole peoples
Things blow, aim low, babrow, see through
At the DMV all day over my vehicle
Thats a long wait when you got a whole lotta things to do
Some like me when I sold crack and diesel
Niggas know my wait was longer than motor vehicles
Blow your brains out and throw the crumbs in the sewer
Put your body on it, I hope you dissolve in manure
Remember when hip hop couldn't hardly remember
Now we makin our own liquor, we entrepreneurs
