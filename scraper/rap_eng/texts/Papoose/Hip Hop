It's that post with street thug
G's who never'since death gave us a deep grudge
I was buzzing when'so coincidently we coexisted with street buzz
'show hate, fake phony blood, suckers who drew blood
Them foam better best get niggas murdered and beat up
We yank you for your chain and then rob you after you re-up
The sunflower seeds, the Phillies, the roll a weed up
The 50 cent soldiers, the fish and chips from free lunch
The homies who disturbing the peace screaming out peace, blood
Shop for 60 dollars, they kill the boy over three cups
Little homie'
Leaders, never follow, we pop bottles in each club'
Jay Z versus Nas'
LL versus Cannabis'

Back to the STREET
We getting more green, a dead president is a small thing
Afford a chrome mine from a gun slinging four green
Cocaine chemist who magnetic the all things
True Religion sweat pants, gun tucked in the draw strings
'Brooklyn niggas who all scheme
The blood shot red eye, skin pale from the chlorine
'a father tells his daughter he never smoking no more, please
Needing medication, fill this prescription at Walgreens
He should be restricted 'cause he's addicted to morphine
The home schooling teacher that educated his offsprings
Got money stashed under the house, by the support beams
No guts, no glory we rarely cheating the war thing
A chess player, checkmate, I'm capturing your queen
This goes out to all of the artists out on the New York scene
The more we de-throne these out-of-towners, the more kings
Dr. Dre versus Easy E
Bizzy B versus'
Let me spell it for you one more time
I keep it HIP HOP
