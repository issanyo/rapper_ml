[Intro]
Maybach Music!
I'm on that grind
This that g rind
Let's grind

[Hook: Papoose]
Maintaining, ain't complaining (x2)
Got to get it, I'ma take it (x2)
Told my family we gon' make it (x2)
I made a promise, I won't break it (Never break my promise)
I'm on that g rind (I'm on that g rind)
I'm on that g rind (I'm on that g rind)
I'm on that g rind (I'm on that g rind)
I'm on that g rind
Grind (x9)

[Verse 1: Papoose]
Homie, I stay on that G rind
This is the way I was designed
Grew up on welfare, hell yeah
Heard when that EBT card said "declined"
Bragging about how you drink wine
Can't see the struggle cause he's flyin'
Had to eat Manwiches, grilled cheese sandwiches
Momma stood on the free cheese line
Cops say they wanna decrease crime
Send me up north and freeze time
Go for the cash, I walk with a mask
Move forward too fast, no rewind
Let's get this dough, [?]
I know it's great, you won't beat mine
Get the bread back cause I'm throwing head cracks
And you throwing the deuces like peace signs
This is how we do on the East side
Add up the money and divide
Run with the wolves, gorillas and killers
You pussy ass nigga, you're feline
Claiming you hustle but he lied
Get rich or die trying, you decide
No cause I'm gully, gun loaded with dummies
You owe me some money, I need mine

[Hook: Papoose]

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Unh
These niggas know I'm surrounded by bangers
These niggas know I don't fuck with strangers
In my hood, nigga, shoot first or get shot
In my hood, shoot first, nigga, or you get shot
I don't fuck with cops or pussy niggas
I'm on my grind, nigga chasing mine
Money on my mind and I can't complain
I'm a country nigga selling Mary Jane
With a big old chain and a Rolex
Work out, no Bowflex
ClayCo, this a coke fest
Keep B's around me, keep C's around me, keep G's around me
Yes, the Lord is by me
I'm gangbanging, your whole clique hanging
Big dog, you a small nigga, I shoot first before I call it, nigga
I shoot first before I call it, nigga
G-G-Grind, shine, grind, shine
All I know is just hustle (SQUAD!)

[Hook: Papoose]

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
On my G rind, you can't see mine
My check deposits, yours got denied
My work be twerking all by itself
I got that A plus. They got that F
You ain't no grinder, you just a rhymer
You just a llama, to me, beef just salami
Fuck all your feelings and how you feel
Cause how I live, I eat what I kill
Relying on my eye and all this crime in my mind
Baby momma on my nerves, better make something happen on these curbs
Trying to bust and get served
Trying to bust me a swerve
All I want, all I need is what a living legend deserves

[Hook: Papoose]
