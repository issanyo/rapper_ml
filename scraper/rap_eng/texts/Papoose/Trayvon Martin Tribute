[Hook] (x2)
Raining in the water
Waiting in the water to run
Raining in the water
Gotta find a trouble to fall down


[Verse 1]
No justice, Zimmerman is a racist
A child-killer, Florida tolerates it
He a wanna be cop, I swear
He dialed 911, forty-six times in the past 8 years
6 since last year, to no avail
When ever he call, he complain about a black male
Trayvon was buying Ice Tea and some skittles
Zimmerman chased him to his death with a pistol
How can you scream self defense
When you had nothing to defend yourself against
Dispatcher told him not to follow, he pursued
With 9mm and called him a fucking coon
A coon is short for raccoon
In the slavery days that's what they called black dudes
Whoever don't help is guilty (why?)
Cause he cried for help, his last words was "Help me"

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The Florida they got a low course stand your ground
Which put a 17 years old young man in the ground
Geraldo said, black kids shouldn't wear hoodies
Compare a hoodie to a killer, how could he
Sean Bell ain't wear a hoodie and they still shot him
Dialo didn't wear a hoodie and they still shot him
What's wrong with Geraldo's brain
The Ku Klux Klan wear hoods ain't nobody complains
Let them keep killing our kings we have no future
Vigilante shooters they say since it happen
Skittles made money in stock my applause
I hope they donate some of that money to the cause
Obama stepped up sold the al shapner
RIP Trayvon Martin
Police chief Bill Lee, justify the murder
Then he stepped down from his position no more further
