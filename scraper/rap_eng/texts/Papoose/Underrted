I don't write rhymes I write prescriptions cause these niggas sickening
My wife is religious her Louis Vuittons are Christian
I put so many holes in you when I bag out the Smith and
Wesson when the wind blow my nigga you gon' be whistling
I got so much stamina man I can go the distance
I get so busy out in the street I need an assistant
Accredit that to God cause he taught me to be persistent
Consistent, relentless, overcome the resistance
Was on Canal Street when cassettes was still in business
I came from the root of canal without a dentist
I leave you pussies bleeding until your cycle has ended
My period is not only at the end of a sentence
(Damn!)
The fifth down in my waistband, the kick back injured my arm I need an ace band
Man I'm on that P Diddy shit, make bands
My watch bright you need Ray Bans
Everybody want a sex doll what is your mental state damn
You want a fake woman cause you a fake man
This what New York sound like, verse whack but your hook tight
Look in my eyes, this is what New York look like
Lames all up in the video, Suge Knight
Lullaby one of you mumble rappers, good night
You wear a lot of name brand clothes but they don't look right
You ain't fly enough to sit on this overbooked flight

My music falling on deaf ears
Does anyone hear me?
My music falling on deaf ears
Is anybody up there?
Do y'all niggas hear me?
Does anybody hear me?
My music falling on deaf ears

I ain't never been afraid
Forever getting paid

I be headed to the stage, stepping in my Jays
I intend to behead 'em and shred 'em with the blade
My endeavors are clever, intelligent and brave
I could disconnect 'em and dead 'em I set him in his grave
Dead presidents get made while my record getting played
A veteran who aged way better than them lames
Invented in my brain and indented on the page my invention can amaze you irrelevant and vague
Disrespected, arrested, I'm fed up with a rage
Even step up in the cage but I never been a slave
Rock a bezel that's engraved with the letters of my name
Resembling the chain, it's a symbol of the pain
Now our levels ain't the same, if it ever gets appraised I'll accept the biggest wage and you just the biggest lame
I done boxed in the snow, wrestled in the rain, bitten by the jaws of the devil with his fangs
Grabbed the handrail, man I tell you it's a shame
Almost knocked to the floor by the
