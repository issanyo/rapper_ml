(Intro)
When we was little kids we used to wrestle
After that we learned how to slap box
After slap boxing it was fist fighting
After that we learned how to clap Glocks

(Verse 1)
Had a bad summer I pray for a better winter
Standing at Deb's door hoping I never enter
Making side beds with the dice to get us richer
Tracy'll burn you everytime if you been against her
I can swing a knife at your head and never miss ya
But aimin' with the cannon just gives me a better picture
A time to heal a time to kill I read the scripture
Life is a b**** I f***ed her but never kissed her
Cross me and get away with it I beg to differ
I'll beat yo a** like Matt Barnes did Derek Fisher
If you can't be yourself you need to chill
I'm from Brooklyn we don't keep it trill we keep it real

(Hook)
I ain't givin' no more handouts
I ain't doin' no more favors
So if you out here looking for handouts
You better put in work that ain't gangsta

(Verse 2)
Ain't nothin' new under the sun
I grew up in a slum
Don't even talk about razors I carry 2 under the tongue
5 n****'s out here livin' off 1 rachet
No bullets and mad beef dumb b******'s
If your brother want it then f*** it come catch it
But go tell your mother she gon need more than just 1 casket
N****'s said they blow money fast but son stack it
Walk through the metal detector the gun plastic
On the KLR i'm a star stun drastic
Ridin' all on the white lines like f*** traffic
Claimin' you a hustler your hustle get dumb backwards
Cause you shouldn't put all your eggs in 1 basket

(Hook)
I ain't givin' no more handouts
I ain't doin' no more favors
So if you out here looking for handouts
You better put in work that ain't gangsta
