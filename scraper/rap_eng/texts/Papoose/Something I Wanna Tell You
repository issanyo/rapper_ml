[Verse 1]
I'm the reason niggas got holes in 'em, exposin' 'em
I used to gamble with little Pop, Rogue and 'em
My son Tommy, Preme, June, Smoke and 'em
I'm a go getter, I go get 'em, Fo-5th 'em
The girls don't give 'em no rhythm, they cold diss 'em
They let me put dick all in 'em, bone in 'em
I used to kick it with whatcha call it, Simone and 'em
But now I kick it with Remy, Keyshia Cole and 'em
I used to play Nintendo, I had the old system
Everyone of my cartridges had a roach in 'em
I used to blow out the roaches and put the codes in 'em
Now it's Playstations and flat screens, I'm cool shit'n
My jeans cost a G, you know my Momentum
I used to wear those jeans but those the old denims
I cop grams, I'm going straight to the stove wit 'em
Give you a dime you let me cook it in your kitchen

There's something I wanna tell you
Matter fact, tell you later - Papoose Pa-poose, None Greater
It's something I think you should know
But you think you know everything - Nacirema Dream

[Verse 2]
My little homie is a G, yeah he ride for his gang
He blood like the fluid that's inside of your veins
Your style is like a thief when he poppin' the chain
Cause all you do is yap, I'm tired of your games
My style is like fire, all my droppin' is flames
You copy my style like we rockin' the same
Try to turn my style around, stop you lame
Niggas turnstiles like he hoppin' a train
I enjoy doin' stickups, I'm brave with robberies
I enjoy sticks like I'm playin' Atari
Wanna ball, got a J like the train to Chauncey
I'm tryin' to get M's like the train to Broad Street
You gon' take a L like the train to Canarsie
Cause man I'm a G like the train to Marcy
COPS BE CLUBBIN' I'm seein' jakes in parties
Rats, roaches, snakes and zombies
They screamin' non-violent, that's the ways of Gandhi
War bring peace so I bring my army
Everywhere I travel man the things upon me
You never know, I'd rather be safe than sorry

[Hook]
There's something I wanna tell you
Matter fact, tell you later - Papoose Pa-poose, None Greater
