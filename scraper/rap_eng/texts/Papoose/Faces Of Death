I like to welcome ya'll niggas to Faces of Death... take a deep breathe... don't be afraid
Papoose, let's go!
I take the grace from him
Break his fate when I'm blazin him
Place him straight in the grave and then
Take his fate off the face of his cranium
Take a taste of your flesh
I break the plate in ya flesh
I hope you takin ya breath
Cause this is faces of death
I left the flesh molded
Cause I'm the best and all the rest know it
I'm papoose, the life or death poet
I take the grace from him
Break his fate when I'm blazin him
Place him straight in the grave and then
Take his fate off the face of his cranium
A young hustla on the block selling his jacks
They told him he can't hustle now he dressed with his gat
Hit him right between the eyes, dead in the head with the mac
Heard how his melon just cracked? Faces of death!
Finally got her in the telly, she prettied that ass fat
Pulled out a condom, and she told you "don't use that"
But you ain't see the monkey is sitting right on her back
Now you positive and you trapped, faces of death!
Stick up kids see a big woolie who flossin
Back the nigga down and took his jewelry off him
But he ain't pat him down good enough and it cost him
He gripped up on the larson, faces of death!
This nigga drunk drivin while he smoking his ganja
They told him "slow down" but he told em "I gotcha"
He crashed, everybody died 'cept for the driver
He the only survivor, faces of death!
I take the grace from him
Break his fate when I'm blazin him
Place him straight in the grave and then
Take his fate off the face of his cranium
Take a taste of your flesh
I break the plate in ya flesh
I hope you takin ya breath
Cause this is faces of death

This wild nigga always known for pickin his gun up
Got caught for a body from some nigga he stuck up
The judge gave him 25 to life, he f*cked up
Went to his cell and hung up, faces of death!
This girl got a boyfriend, she taking him seriously
She love him so much that he broke her virginity
After that he called her and told her it was quits
She went in the room and slit her wrists, faces of death!
This lady goin' to work tryin to feed her children
The ain't know it was war cause she just a civilian
Two airplanes crashed into the buildings
She got crushed by a ceiling, faces of death!
A father left a loaded gun under his mattress
His 4 year old son walked in and grabbed it
He thought it was a toy so he cocked it and clapped it
His body fell down backwards, faces of death!

Place him straight in the grave and then
Take his fate off the face of his cranium
Take a taste of your flesh

The projects look like oversized tombstones
Guess the ghetto is a graveyard, we do em homes
Been here before, so my spirit carry a used soul
My soul can't carry my flesh, so I use bones
I'm a death poet, through life I consume poems
Words can't kill em, so I use chrome
Next time you looking in the mirror, you better pinch your flesh
Make sure the face in your mirror ain't a face of death
Next time you eating your food, take a deep breath
Make your the taste in your mouth ain't a taste of death
Now I laid me down to sleep
I pray to lord my soul will keep
If the reaper come for me I put a hole in my sheets
Every time I go to sleep I sleep holdin my heat
If these upcoming rappers die before I wake
The industry will be mine and I get all this cake
I take the grace from him
Break his fate when I'm blazin him
Place him straight in the grave and then
Take his fate off the face of his cranium
Take a taste of your flesh
I break the plate in ya flesh
I hope you takin ya breath
Cause this is faces of death
I left the flesh molded
Cause I'm the best and all the rest know it
I'm papoose, the life or death poet
I take the grace from him
Break his fate when I'm blazin him
Place him straight in the grave and then
Take his fate off the face of his cranium
