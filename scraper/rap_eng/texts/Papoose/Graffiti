I don't wanna be on TV
Scribble scrabble
Just write my name in graffiti
The air waves don't complete me
Scribble scrabble
Just write my name in Graffiti

[Verse 1]
Peace to the dudes in the back who support me
I appreciate it when you clap and applaud me
I'm fly everyday while your swag is corny
Gino Green shirt, all black in the Moories
I'm in the studio, if you happened to call me
The engineer opened up a track to record me
You wanna be a good fella, that could be costly
You seen what happened to Paulie
You gotta talk to a hater if you want him acting accordingly
Never let a man tell you half of the story
Congratulate me if you see it happening for me
Don't be a hater be a congratulatory
I seen the little homie, hey what's happening shorty
What you wanna be when you grow? He laughed, "C'mon P"
I want my name in lights, flashing Corey
Them other dudes, they ain't in my category
The next day, they hit him in his back with a .40
R.I.P written flat on the wall see
They waited til he died just to pass him his glory
We gotta change that, that's a pattern that bores me
Where's the best graffiti artist, from here to Missouri
Write my name on the wall, tag it up for me

[Verse 2]
Jan Sports for all the backpackers
Ringtone deals for all the wack rappers
Reeboks for all the females, 54 11's long ponytails
I beat your phony mans up, when we was riding on the back of the Yogi Bear bus
Word to her, word life
We used to go to Highland and Park and take dirt bikes
I knew I would get a deal
I'm so Brooklyn, I rode my pedal bike down Miller hill
I wanna say what up to b cat
Keep putting in work, peace to G Rap
I'm representing a beginning
Watching them Flavor videos with Bobby Simmons
Too much sound scan scams, BDS stress
No talent, they average, but screaming they the best
Had magazines like right on and word up
Where they gave artists credit for putting in work but
Now magazines got disrespect turned up
When I journey through your journal, I see you journalist suck
This for the dudes with the spray paint in the air
That make you wonder, like how he get his name up there?
Tagged up in Central Booking, tagged up on the bridge, and the subway, so we kept you looking
They can write your name on TV, before the peoples eyes
Screaming on the radio, you the best, thats a lie
Write my name in graffiti, the streets recognize
Papoose, I'm the greatest lyricist alive
