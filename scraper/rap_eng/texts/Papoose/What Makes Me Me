(Uhn) the nacirema dream the album
It's getting closer y'all
MCs put your thinking caps on
2007 is mine

What makes me me
Cause I dropped 17 CDs
Or the way I been make me a g
What makes you you
Is it cause you stay true to your crew
Or it's just because you do what you do
What makes me the king
Is it the way I'm holding it down
Or it's just because I'm wearing a crown [?] my style
The man makes the money money never makes the man
I'm just trinna help you niggas understand
What makes me me
Talking on the tellie straight driving the legal
Rear view mirrors is clean so I can see you
Yellow lights I speed up so I can speed through
Red monkey junkie now rockin the [?]
Undershirt inthermal shirt rockin the mink too
I hate the cold weather we the tropical people
After the nacirema yea I'm dropping a sequel
A rider like evel knievel
If my life depended on my album would I be alive
Y'all gon execute me or y'all gon let me survive
If my freedom depended on it you witnessed the crime
You gon keep it gangsta or you gon testify
Had your last 20 dollas you love to get high
My album or a bag of weed which one you gon buy
I brought a chair in the booth while I'm spittin this rhyme
Cause I know if I stand up I'm a loose my mind
So I'm a just sit calm like good times
The jeffersons different strokes and family ties
One of my mans was In the crib eatin some chick
She didn't tell him another man got a key to her shit
This nigga walked in the crib squeezin his fif
He killed my homie in his sleep Imma leave you with this
You can end up slumped over asleep in a ditch
When you don't use your head and think with your dick (uhn)
The hood taught me in the backwards way
I was addicted to the way the guns blast away
Started totin hammers hennesy and Aaliz√©
Then I realized all of my idols passed away
In the fast life looking for a faster way
That's the main reason why I'm getting cash today
Had to start all over but I still made a profit
Cause niggas who got rich I was right where they started
I ain't mind starting off like the nigga with bread
I'll follow the path long as I ain't bein misslead
Sink this in your head
I'd rather starve like a man who's alive then end up like a man who's dead
My path is unwalked my craft is blood [?]
I can school your whole class with one thought
Fight for my homie his challenge is unfought
Bang for equality blast the gun (uhn)
They say his album came out trash it's your fault
Am I the 4th quarter assassin of course
Now you acting like you passin your torch
I guess you must think I'm a ass of some sort
You ain't never gave me half the support
That I deserve from you bastards I brought
Lyricism back with classics I [?]
From a to z then went backwards I storched
Set fire to they asses I fought
Went to the south as if the traffic up north
Niggas act as if my math is untaught
That's a portion not half you dumb short dumb short dumb short dumb short
