[Bridge]
I'm from down the hill
The borderline of the Stainville
It's do or die never ran never will
You talk a blood war, I wanna see if it's real

[Hook]
I try you motherfucker I try you
I try you these niggas man, I try you
I try you motherfucker I try you
I try you them niggas man, I try you

[Verse 1]
Niggas be straight frontin'
I move around with the thing on my waist thugging
It's no hate, I don't hate nothing
Man I told them they ain't like that
And none of them ain't sayin' nothing
Man I came out the gate buzzing
Never let a nigga stand and my fate bluffing
Warrup son, ain't nothing
I took so much money in the start
Niggas think I'm bank cutting
Ayo DJ play something
The south cool we be digging they wave cousin
We getting drunk we straight bugging
Brooklyn niggas up in here homie
We ready to lace something
I breathe heavy still got that weed in my lungs
Them lames hating on me but tell them I'm back son
New York on my back it's a rap the rap's gone

[Bridge]
I'm from down the hill
The borderline of the Stainville
It's do or die never ran never will
You talk a blood war, I wanna see if it's real

[Hook]
I try you motherfucker I try you
I try you these niggas man, I try you
I try you motherfucker I try you
I try you them niggas man, I try you

[Verse 2]
He say he a G and his thing be squeezing
I don't believe 'em
He say he up in the can his name was ringing
I don't believe 'em, I don't believe you
I ain't see that when I see you
I straight try you man I don't leave you
What I carry in them robin jeans is lethal
They couldn't mess with me when I was wearing vin diesel
Always bragging you with the next man chick
But that make you a snake if that man in your cling
And then that dogs they don't know what they doin'
Always tryin' to get views until you give 'em a viewing
Funeral home another life ruined
All the cheap shots stop when niggas start shooting
Airing them if they start moving leave 'em with all dirty three in his back
Treating them like Patrick Vieira

[Bridge]
I'm from down the hill
The borderline of the Stainville
It's do or die never ran never will
You talk a blood war, I wanna see if it's real

[Hook]
I try you motherfucker I try you
I try you these niggas man, I try you
I try you motherfucker I try you
I try you them niggas man, I try you

[Verse 3]
All that gangsta talk
All that big money talk
I still try you man
I wanna see if it's real
This goes out to all my niggas man
Who they proclaiming that niggas supposed to be this and
He supposed to be that
And you looking at them and that thought just crossed your mind like
I try you nigga
I know you growing late all my real niggas relate
In case you to the death of me
The dream is the album coming soon
I know you hear my footsteps bozo
King of New York talk
This the lords of the land man
This the lords of Brooklyn
Anybody can get it
Ain't no t favor
