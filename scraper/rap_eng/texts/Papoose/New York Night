[Verse 1]
I'm a New Yorker downtown Brooklyn worker
Payphone talker it only cost me a quarter
I'm thirsty New York summer hot as a sauna
Put my mouth to the fire hydrant and drink some water
We try to stop a yellow cab but he ignored us
He just splash mud in my face cause of my aura
No camera phones it was just camcorders
But we made movies sprayed ozzies transformer
Intellect speaker fresh snikers dear dorers
When we put the work in the pot it dance on us
I used to re up up town transporter
Hood swag, book bag, jams porter
Five o'clock news somebody got out of order
People waving over the shoulders of news reporters
Hi mom, hip hop we cypher of the corner
I spit till I was tired, alphabetical slaughter

[Hook]
Still it's the dark side of divine
Years go past I'm getting nicer with mind
You don't respect what the dog write in his rhyme
Don't expect to be seen by the side of the blind
But still yeah, it's the dark side of divine
Years go past I'm getting nicer with mind
You don't respect what the dog write in his rhyme
Don't expect to be seen by the side of the blind

[Verse 2]
Girls toes hanging out of their sandals
I rush home so I can watch Ralph McDaniels
Back then the gun charge was only a year
Walkman, my headphones over my ears
It takes 2 I used to listen to raw beats
My tape pop I tape it back together with Scotch Tape
We ain't had metro cards we had tokens
Andr√© The Giant got slammed by Hulk Hogan
Chicken pox passed the call on my allusion
David Takens black folks started hoping
White folks caught not snitching the gag order
Italians call it a code of silence they blast talkers
Blacks, they wanna put the label of rats on us
So they encourage us to tell then they laugh on us
No other race do it they want their soul to be gone
Snitching is not a street thing it's just morally wrong

[Hook]
Still it's the dark side of divine
Years go past I'm getting nicer with mind
You don't respect what the dog write in his rhyme
Don't expect to be seen by the side of the blind
But still yeah, it's the dark side of divine
Years go past I'm getting nicer with mind
You don't respect what the dog write in his rhyme
Don't expect to be seen by the side of the blind

[Outro]
It's just another New York night
It take a certain level of conscience to comprehend my message
So I understand why you hate on me man
I don't expect to be seen by he side of the blind
Hip hop is in my blood
You gotta make me bleed if you wanna get rid of it
So in that note, I remain
The most hated alive
Most hated alive
Most hated alive
Peace
