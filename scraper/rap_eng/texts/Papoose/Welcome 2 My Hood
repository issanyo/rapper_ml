Shout out to Khaled on this joint right here
Thugga, Brooklyn, Pa-poose Pa-poose

Verse:

They be in the back of Manhattan
They sippin' daiquiris
They be dressin' casual huh?
I give 'em casualties
My faculty actually stack wit me
Get the salary
King of The Big Apple
I'm The Big Apple ya majesty
Gun battle
I clap 'til his Adam's Apple bleed
Catch them niggas slippin'
N' hit 'em in front of Applebee's
Got the tricciest cavalry
Every semi is actually
Next to milli's my ratchets be
In some serious galleries
I get furious rapidly
Got the bliccety gat wit me
My affiliates blast fo me
Cause ya city catastrophe
Hit a curious cat wit three
Give a idiot agony
Rude boy like Bobby Konders, Jabba in Massive B
Witty his family
We get busy in tragedy
You see Remi in bacc of me
We like Mickey n' Mallory
I reign supreme
A mean machine
In the seem of my jeans
Bring the thing
You seen the beam
I lean your regime
Cut ya hair
N' clean ya beam
Blow your brains on the sidewalk
I seen your dreams
Ask you "What's your favorite movie?" like that scene in Scream
Then stick the heavy machete in between ya spleen

You disappear when I swing these things
Cuz I know Magic like
Gilbert Arenas team
Pull strings for cream
The queen in the bing
The king on the scene
Scheme for green from spring to spring
Had to sling the thing
So I could bling the ring
It's big enough to hold a boxin' match
Ding ding
Give the critics hell
Spit it well
Lit a L
Then prevail
As a inmate in a cell
I get high as a prison bail
Timid pale niggas frail
When they like to kiss n' tell
Dicc long as a lizard tail
So I make the women yell
Bust nutts like Chip n' Dale
Scratches on my bacc
Cuz she dig her nails
I get mo head n' tail than a wishin' well
Got a gut feelin' that you could take me to spit a shell
Homie we could settle that gut feelin' like ginger ale
Leave yo body wit a smell
Cops'll never get the trail
Make a sharp turn on Riverdale
Shoot like the Dallas Mavericks
Pack the wallets
Apparatus
Pass the paccage
Bags the fattest
Pass ya status
Had the baddest lavish palace
Flash the karats
Then I brandish the hammers
Hit them savage average maggot faggot rappers
In the cabbage n' vanish
Every passenger's acid
So I jus laugh at them bastards
Rocc 'em to sleep
My mob is too deep
I be handin' havoc
Click clack it in traffic
N' let the passengers have it
Give you half of them Clipse
Like Pusha T wit no Malice
A Brooklyn G wit no stylist
Kush n' cheese in my jacket
I be tossin' the ratchet
All you be tossin' is salad
Understand this..
I run the planet
I brung the cannon
I come to damage
None'll manage
Some'll panic
Others frantic
Got a tough advantage
Man I give you a knuckle sandwich
Make you touch the canvas
Wit yo head in a fuckin' bandage
Headin' up Atlantic
Go to Gleason's like Ralph Kramden
Man I'm outstandin'
Never strike without plannin'
