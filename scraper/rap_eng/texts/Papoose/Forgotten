Left for dead, dissed and forgotten [x3]
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone
Stiff and rotten
Left for dead, dissed and forgotten [x3]
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone
Stiff and rotten
Left for dead, dissed and forgotten [x3]
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone
Stiff and rotten

I've been abducted by this thug shit
Fucked up and corrupted
Stabbed in the back by cocksuckers I trusted
Backstabbers, you wouldn't believe the stuff I was stuck with
It plummets to my stomach I suffered I'm disgusted
I adjusted 'cause I thugged in I'm reluctant
Kept in rucket, gust a moschet, rust it
Then I clutched it when I bust it
Frank fooled an ass nigga I splatter your bustin
Hussling with my cousins we moving work by the dozens
Intercause buzzing we had to hope build in public
The public wanted justice but that's a whole another subject
Discovered by them buzzers they interrupted and rushed it
You a true thing, I never lied to you my beloved
My reality's police brutality, yours wasn't
The bandages couldn't hide the damages that was coming
My wrist bleeding busting from when they cuffed it
You hating on me, no acknowledgment won't discuss it

Left for dead, dissed and forgotten [x3]
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone
Stiff and rotten
