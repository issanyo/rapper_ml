[Intro]
I'd like to welcome y'all to the Cigar Society
Garcia Vegas with black dragons to be exact
Leaders and followers
Bosses and workers
Peasants and kings

[Hook X2]
Dead presidents, gangstas, and civilians
Nobody wanna see a nigga make millions
But when you spend a hundred thousand, what a feelin'
Harlem! Stand up! We in the building
Aiyyo Lux, you gotta great mind king
You like mine's, king?
Likewise, king

[Verse 1: Papoose]
A man come outta jail, you'll give him some dollars
But give a man nothing when he get outta college
Harry D. Rockefeller drug laws
Law and Order legislative, study your butter cause
Mastermind planning to stick up a gun store
Squeezin on a MAC with the serial number rubbed off
Young niggas using their teeth to open the duck sauce
They don't have religion they only pray to the drug lord
Likewise, they're ready to die in my lifetime
Caters to Makaveli, It Was Written just like Nas
El Be Logos, Gucci Symbols at night time
Jewelers goin' to hell, he put diamonds in Christ Eyes
Up in that Grandmaster flash coke, white lines
Sucking a glass dick, pulling crack through pipeline
Don't like nobody sittin' behind me catch a Trife Bind
Right hand man, supposed to stand on my right side

[Hook X2]

[Verse 2: Loaded Lux]
I never got in this for the Heroism
Now hurry outta the projects to Hurl with him
[?] get it
Thorough Living
Meryl's Lynching
They watching the pearls glistening with Girls listening
The World's Ending
I look at life like a book to write but it should be light
What you like, I could be wrong, you could be right
With jokes plastered all over the broke bastard
I'm Bodacious, still gettin' my own
It's cold asking the hot and bother
You got a marker?
You're not the author
Your posse talking
[?]
We goin' let him have it

[Hook X2]
