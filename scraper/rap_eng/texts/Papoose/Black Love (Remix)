[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
I like men at least 6 feet, faithful don't cheat
So good he make me hate my ex men like Mystique
Good conversation, girl he so deep
Real intelligent when he talking I don't speak
Gives me TLC and he don't creep
My best friend I ain't got a secret he won't keep
Street credibility he an OG
Drive a fast V and he give me that slow D
Listens and attentive he know me
Doesn't just tell me that he love me he show me
Makes me smile so much I'ma get crow's feet
We see Broadway plays, we travel, we go eat
He full of surprises don't peek
He wash my hair and blow dried it, low heat
I'm a boss, he a boss no rules, no meat
And even though it's just two of us we roll deep

[Hook: Nathaniel]
This is power, this is pride
King and Queen, so divine
If love could kill it'll be a homicide
No describing, this thing we got
Ain't nothing like black love
Ain't nothing like black love
Ain't nothing like black love
No, ain't nothing like black love
Ain't nothing like black love

[Verse 2: Papoose]
I like girls with gold teeth, faithful don't cheat
Let me handcuff her to the bed like police
Too real for twitter man she so street
Check her timeline, you won't see no tweets
Ride or die chick, you don't want no beef
Good sense of humor, she funny like Monique
She a neat freak, the crib be so neat
A night freak swear to God, I don't get no sleep
Ahead cause we both getting bread, whole wheat
Disagree we gon' patch it up, slowly
Watched Kevin Hart he had me so weak
Seen Cooley High we cried for Cochise
Eating mangos in the summer so sweet
We be riding on them jet skis, Jones beach
Strong like forty kings and queens we both be
Even though it's just two of us we roll deep

[Hook: Nathaniel]
This is power, this is pride
King and Queen, so divine
If love could kill it'll be a homicide
No describing, this thing we got
Ain't nothing like black love
Ain't nothing like black love
Ain't nothing like black love
No, ain't nothing like black love
Ain't nothing like black love
