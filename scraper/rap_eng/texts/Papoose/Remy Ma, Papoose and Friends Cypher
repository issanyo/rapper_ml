[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
I'm so freakin' unorthodox
I make bacon out of pigs
Throw Molotovs at squad cars and torture cops
Hardcore, tear at a bunch of hoes and they mothers' skirts
I'm the stirrer, sip syrup with Mrs Butterworth
**Burr** My guns stutter first before I murk a jerk
A hopeless romantic, I punch him off for a Birkin purse
I was cursed at birth, came out and hurt the nurse
I'm so freakin' high I'm saying goodbye to Earth
I used to be considered a failure
I'd beat up a Kangaroo to nail Iggy Azalea
Brass knuckle Benton, these rappers they [fucking] kitten
I'm Ozzy Ozbourne, I'll bite the head off a pigeon
I'm a AT-alien, bizarre rapper that's shavin' a
Scalp off your cranium, baby say hey to Damien
Tomahawk choppin' the bodies right by the stadium
Exercise violence I kill 'em at a gymnasium
No flex zone, the most slept on
East side grew up off of greens and egg bone
I'm God with a murderous ink pen
[Fuck] everybody, now Jamal Pryor dead
Bitch I don't need friends

[Verse 2: Corey Charron]
Bring in another friend and it won't be a solo fight
Two will be in dirt like motorbikes
Listen, pinheads, Charron was right
Too gutter with nothin' to spare, you'd swear that I'm bowling strikes
Punches hitting so hard you have to ice this
On cam, I'm cutthroat like ISIS
Fight this, steppin' around, in need of a crown
This ain't Krusty Burger, I'm not beefin' with clowns
Out in Canada I'm the dude to battle first
Front with me, you'll ruin your career, this like the Madden curse
This ain't ready for the shot and all the cash
I sign my name and bury ya soon as a body cast
Leave the folk to idolize with idol eyes
So def, don't make sense that I'm on time
Won't stop 'til they put me on a Billboard
If the good die young, I would have been a stillborn
Charron, Canada

[Verse 3: Remy Ma & Papoose]
Remy the Ruler's back, yeah, Sheezus Christ
And I'm the God MC, so she's Jesus wife
A cypher with us, they must wanna leave this life
Cause never in your lifetime would you be this nice
Bae they stole my style, I came to smack the thief
When I walk the ground split, I could crack the street
"I woke up like this", that's a bragging speech
Chicks been claiming that since Beyonc√© last release
They whole swag is weak
Right, and if she woke up like that, she need to go back to sleep
Yo, we gon' show y'all the meaning of black love
You having a bad day, I fill up the bath tub
She put on a oven mit, we cooking up mad grub
Got beef with a nigga, put on a black glove
Who run the world? Girls
Rem you bugging
Besides every great man bae is a good woman
Anybody think differently, gotta be a hater
Name one good man
Will Smith, Jada, Melo, Lala
Mandela, Winnie, Swizz, Alicia
2Pac, Afeni, T.I., Tiny
Barack, Michelle
What about Dwayne Wade, he got Gabrielle
Nick, Mariah, Wiz, Amber
Martin, Coretta, Biggie, Voletta
Jay-Z, Beyonce, Kanye, Kim K
Papoose, Remy, That's black love everyday
See Rem's really rapping, these broads just yapping
I smack a chick quick like, "what happened?"
I ain't never see the broads in the trap and
If you think I'm throwing a subliminal then catch it
Yo, we ridin' in that Rolls Royce
Just because you in that Cypher don't get gassed, Funk Flex voice
Catch you in your car, I'ma blow out your tires
You engaged to your girl, I engage in fire
