[Hook:]
The pimpin won't die
In the ghetto, they call her shorty but she tollin her stiletto
The pimpin won't die
Wutchu doin on the street?
You ain't a pimp, she's a kid
The pimpin won't die
To all men and women
You talkin or you listenin? You pimpin or you trickin?
The pimpin won't die
In the ghetto

[Bridge 1:]
I hope this song finds you in good health
I got my thinking caps on
Whatever happened to that baby from that 2 Pac song?
We gotta start where they left off, to move our zone
If you won't do the same, you rock wrong

[Verse 1:]
She was born in the bathroom, her mama left her in the trashcan
Would be dead but she got found by the garbage man
Remember her pops who molester
Her moms' name was Brenda
Baby girl all alone, she grew up on her own
Went from foster home to foster home
She keep her fingernails clean, low rider jeans
But her low rider jeans ain't low as her self-esteem
This happens every day, nobody deserve this
She grew up to feel worthless
Her parents gambled with her life
Evens in all, choose
You just witnessed the birth of a prostitute

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
They say it's 2 ways out of the ghetto
Either you rappin or you playin ball
I done heard people say it all
Those male dominating ways for a man to prevail
But what's the exit for a young female?
Either you shippin or you go to school
Play dumb when you young and be a older fool
Know to choose, the older dudes try to school her every day
Her response was well, anyway
She rather take the ass titty way
They say human experience beats book knowledge every day
Somebody help this child, can we pray?
Cause she rather take human experience
She see them other prostitutes getting it, now she curious
She's locked in the zone
With parts of her body getting sold
Ain't listen to what the old timers told, call em old
The only thing worse than getting old
Is not getting old, the block's getting cold

[Hook:]

[Bridge 2:]
I hope this song finds you in good health
I got my thinking caps on
What ever happened to that kid from that Slick Rick song?
We gotta start where they left off, to move our zone
If you won't do the same, you rock wrong

[Verse 3:]
See that once was a little boy, you was misled
By another little boy and this is what he said
As I quote from a man, you hope me gonna make some cash
Robbing old folks to making a dash
He was only 17, in a mad man's dream
The cops shot him, he survived that, back on the scene
Robbery ain't work so he got a new thing
He digging in the scene with his gangsta lean
We suck the blood out them girls that call him a bloodsucker
Ask my opinion, I call him a motherfucker
He gambled with his own life, head crack 6
You just witnessed the birth of a pimp

[Hook:]

The pimpin won't die (x3)
