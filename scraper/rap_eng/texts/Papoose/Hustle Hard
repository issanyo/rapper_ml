[Verse 1: Papoose]
Listen if you eightball shavin' on the block
Turn 7 grams to 14 grams you gotta (Hustle Hard)
Turn 14 to 28 fast
56 to 100 grams, now I'm on yo ass (Hustle Hard)
I ain't stoppin' at a hundred grams
A hundred grams to a hundred grand
Let's take it back to the gutter fam, I ain't shaking none of your suckas hands
Cause I'm better than you, you, him, and your other man
They Nino Brown when they makin' them sucka jams
But they get to the radio and turn to the gutterman
You and your R&B boss make a good couple fam
I'm a catch you at Lover's Lane like Son of Sam
Got the revolver in my fuckin' hand
Automatics like that Hot 97 concert, summer jam
Half of my work, give samples to keep 'em comin' fam
I sample 50 like I just copped a hundred grams

[Verse 2: Papoose]
I paid for 7 this nigga tried to sell me 6
You can't jerk me I got more scales than fish
Niggas' mad cause they can't make a sell for shit
When I'm on the block I make more sales than Sprint
Gone have to bust yo gun if you bust my balls
This nigga owe me some money tryin' to duck my calls
Follow them up the one-way street, he smokin' on a loosay
He seen me and tried to bust a U-way
So I caught him on a 2-way street and gripped on a Uzi
I ain't have a sidekick but I hit em' on a 2-way
You brought 10 nigga's who thought they'd never see you breathless
Well that's somethin' that Tennessee like Memphis
Rappers be tryin' to get in where they fit in like Tetris
That's why I Ieave they family mourning like breakfast
They see other niggas do it and then they try to follow
That's why I leave they family mourning like Alonzo

[Verse 3: Papoose]
I lead the rifle raw, you just went right through your final door
I invite you all, never did like you or trifle fraud
Sick as psycho wards, fight you on vinyl, my mic recital was vital
Shine a light that'll blind you, my light that'll fight for your title
Cry for ? like Michael, my life recycled the cycle
I could write you a bible, look in the eyes of your idle
I'm right behind you, I lined you, I stifled yours
You rap niggas marked for death like Michael Moore (Hustle hard)
Yeah even my rhymes is a hustle
I'm sellin' 'em to your mind, watch my respect double (Hustle hard)
They never used to wanna produce him or introduce him
Gettin' textes from niggas who rappin'
Text messages from niggas who producin'
Now a days I get more Texas than Houston (Hustle hard)
Ha, you ain't doin' no real bubblin'
You keep your ear of the street, stop air hustlin'
