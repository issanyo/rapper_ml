[Intro: Papoose]
This is a G call
These niggas ain't built like that
This is a G call

[Chorus: Papoose]
When we make a G call, you shouldn't answer
Cause you ain't a gangster, you's a dancer
Your dirty drawers showing boy, pull your pants up
Deadbeat dad, the kids need pampers
You ain't built like that
(You ain't gangster)
You ain't built like that
(You ain't a murderer)
You ain't built like that

[Verse 1: Papoose]
Tired of hearing niggas say they're doing it big
But they ain't big enough to take care of their kids
He be on the internet shooting a vid
Couldn't even help his baby moms move in the crib
Everybody swiping all over the world
But when I was growing up, that was a hustle for girls
I ain't hiding, I'm riding, I ain't running, I'm going
I ain't ducking, I'm bucking, homie, get shot in your stomach
Dickriding without a helmet ain't safe
So all you dickriding niggas, helmet over your face
Smack the taste out of your mouth with the nose of them eights
Bang the hammer like the judge when he closing the case
When they hear the shit bumping, they say, "who is that?"
Tell them corny ass niggas Papoose is back
I'ma keep it G real, cuz, you been wack
Keep selling that garbage, I'ma move this crack

[Chorus: Papoose]
When we make a G call, you shouldn't answer
Cause you ain't a gangster, you's a dancer
Your dirty drawers showing boy, pull your pants up
Deadbeat dad, the kids need pampers
You ain't built like that
(You ain't gangster)
You ain't built like that
(You ain't a murderer)
You ain't built like that

[Verse 2: Papoose]
Tell you hurry up when it's time for thugging in the streets
But take their time when they got a plug for you to eat
My respect level for these suckers is the least
Throw you with the opportunity but rush you when it's beef
You's a dishwasher, cocksucker, I'm a beast
I don't wash dishes, I just dump them in the sink
Make a long story short cause my summary is deep
My loyalty is powerful, your fuckery is weak
If you know he a snitch and you running with the creep
You a rat, you're only as good as the company you keep
Innocent 'til proven guilty, alive 'til they kill me
I'ma keep doing them dirty until they're filthy
A cow when it comes to the beef, they never milk me
Body your mother, face firing, he shouldn't have grilled me
You don't understand my ways, you don't feel me
That's cause you're not built like that, this how they built me

[Chorus: Papoose]
When we make a G call, you shouldn't answer
Cause you ain't a gangster, you's a dancer
Your dirty drawers showing boy, pull your pants up
Deadbeat dad, the kids need pampers
You ain't built like that
(You ain't gangster)
You ain't built like that
(You ain't a murderer)
You ain't built like that
