Y'all had to listen to garbage I know y'all glad remy back
Getting that paper, that bag
You're not bad you're doing bad
Mad cause I'm not mad
Can't take you serious, period
You live in your moms pad
Heard you was at the freestyle and you was way scared
Bitch I'm so secure I wrote this on the way here
Been killing kids while they nap, since daycare
I got this sewed up and on track like fake hair
When niggas ask me to spit, they know what I'm bout to do
When they ask you to spit, they wanna see what that mouth do
When I talk greasy trust it ain't about you
I don't shade, I say names you don't want me to shout you
Every bar is a bar, bitch what you know bout that
They calling me bars bitch or kit kat
You get that
You broads never go hard on a rap
Okay, maybe once or twice but you ain't all of that
See your whole style, bitten
Pieces ain't hitting
When I said it was written, I was talking bout y'all bitches
Y'all trying to play chess, but why would I play you
When I could knock the whole fucking board off the table
See I been the difference I don't do the shit they do
When I'm around they quiet, I'm loud you bitches k2
Im straight remy no chase boo
And y'all a bunch of old birds, y'all just grey goose
I'm probably the only chick that make flex drop bombs
Got more punchlines than thirsty niggas at prom
I ain't gotta fraud for you, black love be how I live
Before I made it cool you was HOP positive
I put you on punishment, now I gotta beat yo ass
You like a disobedient teenager, you wanna be in the streets so bad
All this talk about my and your son
I'm hot and your whole world revolve around me, bitch I am the sun
Wanted to be an icon, ended up like Akon
They finally let me out now I'm an XCON
Everybody ratting, I really need some d con
Told flex put the beat on, so I can go pecan
I showed hoes the way, I'm the light, I'm the beacon
Looking for that real bitch, I'm the one that y'all seek on
I'm on paper I'm over here blowing dank, y'all bitches really haters over there shooting blanks
But who knows, you might really hit something one day
But right now, your shit is weaker than Monday through Sunday
I'll take your wig off, no literally take your wig off
It's funny when she's talking tough, cause we know the bitch soft
And if she soft you sophomore
That's why I school freshmans and juniors, but let me tell y'all what for
Cause at 3 us, 2 can shoot the one
I'm 195 ten you little bitches is done
I got that face on pretty, attitude on savage
NEW York city I'm in the center like javage
Now this the part where I talk shit, I know y'all hate that
This part not about bars, it's just all straight facts
In 2 years, no album, no solo single, no tour
3 million followers and got 2 BET awards
Got the album of the summer, independent and the shit popped
Legitimized an entire franchise of love and hip hop
Ratings be Monday night, football to be toward thrice
Had Hov on my remix, deadass I am nice
Appointed black love, I made it cool to be cuffing
I body every beat I touch and then I married my husband
Brought NEW York rap back, rapping how I really rap
Bodied summer jam twice, what you know about that
Two soul train awards, yeah female rap changing it
And yesterday I woke up to two Grammy nominations, FACTS
