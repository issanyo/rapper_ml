[Intro]
Cause when I rapper get hot they can't stop it
Billboard chart straight to the top kid
I don't know maybe I'm a profit
But damn R.I.P. to Johnnie Cochran
You give me strength when I'm facing the world
That's why I buy the best diamond and your favorite pearls
If it was mine I woulda gave you the world
I'm dedicating this one to my favorite girl

[Hook]
You are my girl (yeah...)
You don't like it when I call you that
You say no I'm your wife, I'm not your girl Pap
You are my girl
You don't like it when I call you that
You say no I'm your wife, I'm not your girl Pap

[Verse 1]
Every other day you see me in the news paper
Every other day you see my face on the news
I didn't come in this game to cause controversy
They don't understand me, the world is confused
I was raised in bed-stuy so I gotta stand up for my woman
I'm a stand up guy and the CEO's is not too smart
I would need her hand cuff key when I got the key to ya heart
You had no father so you want me to replace him
Told my daughters the same that I must educate them
I'm only Papoose girl I gotta save him
They killed Sean Bell they exonerated them
Black on black crime they get us convicted
When it's white against black they get them acquitted
If I could talk to the judge I'll let her know
I wish she can lock me up and let you go
My baby girl

[Hook]
You are my girl (yeah...)
Always sittin' on daddy lap
You say daddy in yo daughter why you call me that
You are my girl
Always sittin' on daddy lap
You say daddy in yo daughter why you call me that

[Verse 2]
Mama's baby and papa's maybe
That sound kinda crazy
She cried when her moms tried to put her in the bed
She wanted daddy to put her
Cause daddy understood her
She cried when her moms tried to push her in the stroller
She wanted daddy to push her
Ain't wanted to go to school unless daddy took her
Girl stop teasin' your brother cause he eat his buggers
Come over here and give daddy some sugar
I discipline her cause it makes her smarter
Left some money in the bank for you, you'll be rich tomorrow
Take her to the beauty parlor and my son to the barber
Teach them how to play something
Besides cops and robbers
You grow up life's gon' be harder
Only marry yo boyfriend if he's a better man then your father
My son's gonna be stronger
Boys stay attached to there mother
Girls attached to their father
My baby girl

[Hook]
You are my girl (yeah...)
You don't like it when I call you that
You say no I'm your mother, I'm not your girl Pap
You are my girl
You don't like it when I call you that
You say no I'm your mother, I'm not your girl Pap

[Verse 3]
If I forget about my mother
She'll whoop my ass
That's why I had to save the best for last
Everything I wanted under the Christmas tree
Without you they wouldn't be no me
I use to tell I wanted to be a rapper
She told me you can do it
My momma she pretty as Cleopatra
And man I hate liars they deserve to suffer
They so quick to say a word to they mother
My man O lost his mom he took it like a man
Darrell lost his mom and he took it like a man
Slay lost his grandmother and her took it like a man
That's a part of life I don't understand
Call me a momma's boy no a momma's man
I couldn't even keep a steady hand
God forbid I guess you more man then me nigga
The day I lose my mom I'm goin' with her
My baby girl

[Hook]
You give me strength when I'm facing the world
(You are my girl...)
That's why I buy the best diamonds and yo favorite peals
If it was mine I would gave you the world
(You are my girl...)
That's why in dedicating this one to my favorite girl

[Outro]
This song is dedicated to all the females in my life
With out them there would be no us
The mothers the aunts the sisters the grandmothers
The wives but last but not least the daughters
You gotta take care of them

[Hook]
You are my girl (yeah...)
You don't like it when I call you that
You say no I'm your mother, I'm not your girl Pap
You are my girl
You don't like it when I call you that
You say no I'm your mother, I'm not your girl Pap
And you are my girl...
