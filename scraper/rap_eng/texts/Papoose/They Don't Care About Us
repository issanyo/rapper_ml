(Hook)
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation
Everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news
Everybody, dog food
Bang bang, shot dead
Everybody’s gone mad
All I wanna say is that
They don’t really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don’t really care about us

(Verse 1)
Everybody dying from prescription drugs comatose
Rest in Peace Mac Miller aledigly overdose
Lebron James build a school tryna help teach the children
Triple X shot down instead of helping people fuming
Going through sexism so she said what she was feeling
I would rather loose before I cheat said Serena Williams
Drama came funeral family grief it needs some healing
Donald Trump not invited would've had to leave the building
NFL banned Colin Kaepernick cause he was kneeling
Nike saw them capital lost over now they reaping millions
Nike app more people registered are you insane
Everybody logged in password username
Nike only did it for the money not for you to game
Don't you know the meaning of investment truth remains
Put the money out it comes back to you use your brain
Cause the Nike sign is not a check that's a boomerang

(Hook)
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation
Everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news
Everybody, dog food
Bang bang, shot dead
Everybody’s gone mad
All I wanna say is that
They don’t really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don’t really care about us

(Verse 2)
Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico lives doomed
Nobody cares anymore cause the hype cooned
Deaths in Chicago bullet hole knife wound
People losing lives in Japan typhoon
What happened to real teachers why they misguiding us
Slicker pressers lip professors Instagram pholosofers
Cops shot a man in his own home how heartless
Said it was an accident went into the wrong appartment
Foul play everyday she'll get acquitted easily
Rest in Peace Aretha Franklin R E S P E C T
Conspiracy corruption tryna have us wiped out
Dropped dead op-ed exposed the white house
Zimmerman's a hot head always spewing lies out
He threatened Beyonce wait a minute time out
If we ain't handle him what's all the black on black crime 'bout
Bang bang shot dead everybody gone bad

(Hook)
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation
Everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news
Everybody, dog food
Bang bang, shot dead
Everybody’s gone mad
All I wanna say is that
They don’t really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don’t really care about us
