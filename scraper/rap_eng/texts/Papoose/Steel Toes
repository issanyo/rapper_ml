[Intro: Papoose]
Ayo Peter Parker, I told you I got you..
Bullet Brak what up!!
Papoose, Pap-poose..
Thugga!
From New York City, to your city man
Let's get busy, real hip hop!

[Verse 1: Bullet Brak]
Life's good, gettin' paid off my mental waves
I'm tryin' duck these Stan's, Bitin' like dental trays
Memorize a couple plays, quick to call an audible
And if we on the battlefield, know i'm gonna slaughter you

Lyrical tactician that leave ya style missin'
Who gone float like butterflies, beat you like Sonny Liston
Anyone that listen hear my passion through my pen
And if you speedin' through life bet you crashin' at the end

Na we ain't friends, I don't know you either
I'm out here chasin ends, with my little heater
Catch a small breather, sit, reevaluate
Smokin strong reefer while i'm scrolling through the daily hate

Shittin on ya favorite rapper, Brak be the truth
I can put together seminars with tracks and a booth
I'm a new veteran, who's tougher than leather skin
And i'm done with the knocking, you better let'em in

[Chorus 1: Bullet Brak]
The way the boy kicks flows
Field Goals
Ayo that style go hard
Steel Toes
Everyday another chance to make it better
Grind heavy, Lord knows what it takes to make chedda
The way the boy kicks flows
Field Goals
Ayo that style go hard
Steel Toes
Everyday another chance to make it better
Grind heavy, Lord knows what it takes to make chedda

[Verse 2: Papoose]
(Papoose, Pap-poose..)
I represent with Peter Parker, born to be a monsta
If you've ever felt a machete my mind is even sharper
They put the battery in ya back, i squeeze the llama
Let the lead leave ya battery dead, you need a charger

You needed help so we called you helpless
Sent you a couple dollars, signed off and mailed it
You ain't return the favor cuz you soft as velvet
More jewels for yourself, see you flossin' selfish

Catch you on your motorcycle, you gone get dealt with
I'ma let a couple shots knock off ya helmet
Hit you from the stomach down, toss ya pelvis
You ain't the king of rock but of course you Elvis

Hollered at ya girl and nailed it
You just a baby boy, better watch how you talk to Melvin
Your full metal jacket, hope its gonna get welded
Have you talkin to the Doc like the Boston Celtics


[Chorus 2: Bullet Brak]
The way the boy kicks flows
Field Goals
Ayo that style go hard
Steel Toes
Everyday another chance to make it better
Grind heavy, Lord knows what it takes to make chedda
The way the boy kicks flows
Field Goals
Ayo that style go hard
Steel Toes
Everyday another chance to make it better
Grind heavy, Lord knows what it takes to make chedda
