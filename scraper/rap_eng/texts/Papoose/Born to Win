Yeah (Yeah)
Papoose (Papoose)
I wanna give a big shoutout to Da Riffs! (Shoutout to Da Riffs!)
Keep producing that fire!
Let's go!

[Hook]
Cause when it all begins
My eyes on the prize so it's on again
I refuse to loose I ain't gon' pretend
I thought I told you I was born to win
Everybody loves a winner!

Victory I choose
Ain't no turning back cause I paid my dues
I tighten up my laces when I tie my shoes
Born to win, I refuse to lose
Everybody loves a winner!

[Verse 1]
My adrenaline rushing through my veins
Next stop is victory, it's rushing like a train
I'm determined to win, cause there's nothing like the pain of defeat
I refuse to remain incomplete
Gotta lot of stamina cause I train for some weeks
Got my strength from the vitamins and the grains that I eat
All obstacles overcame, I'm unique
I started from the bottom, see I came from beneath
The sky's the limit so I'mma raise to my peak
Winning is everything, let me explain what I think
Practice makes perfect, so when working I dont relax
I practice a lot, therefore I'm perfect and that's a fact
Been through some hard times while the burner was on my back
It was rough, but I was determined so I adapt
Gettin what I'm deserving, holla back
Game over you lost like a person with outta map

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My competition said I wasn't ready to face him
My teammates said 'I think we need to replace him'
All the haters used to say 'Boo we hate him'
I wanna thank y'all for the inspiration
Waited a long time for my time I'm anxious
Something like a doctor, cause I got patience
May the best man win, the worst man lose
Last man no choice, the first man choose
I was born as a leader, that's what I gotta be
I don't follow rules, I let the rules follow me
I'mma focus man on the lose, animal out the cage
An ambitious and vicious champion with a rage
What's the difference between a champion and a challenger?
A champion already conquered his caliber
You trying to become, a champion became
I got more wins then a hurricane

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
That's why I eat finer foods
Complete wiser moves, I'mma retire you
No remorse for these tired dudes
Let's celebrate the victory, I won like three minus two
Its only what you make it thats what we gotta remember
But deep down inside everybodies a winner
You gotta work hard January 'til December
Finish what you start and you can be a contender
Watch the man in the mirror, look into your inner
Self, maintian health and never be a quitter
Gotta shine like the sun, flow like the river
You see a chance to win then take it like a picture
I ain't tryna preach to you don't feel bitter
I'm just tryna tell you what it take to be a winner
He's a champion cause it's impossible to stop him
Victory is a option

[Hook]
