[Intro: Hot Rod]
Yeah, you know who it is, it's your boy, Hot Rod
Chillin' with my man Papoose, get that gwap, nigga
1.5 haha, I love it
Hey, let me borrow 20 bucks, nigga

[Verse 1: Hot Rod]
Man these niggas is so shook
I had to get an alarm on my pen and insurance on my notebook
You little rappers is textbook
Still tryna bounce-pass while I hit 'em with the no-look
Now give me the loot, Hennessy and juice
While I'm spittin' with Papoose in my fire man suit
If hip-hop is dead, we goin' to its grave, yup
To hold a concert and watch the shit raise up
And then call it the second coming
Real MCs will celebrate, the fake ones start runnin'
You ain't poppin' your gun if you ain't got one
You ain't pimpin' no hoes if you ain't got none
Shotgun in the old school but I'm from the new school
My whip, '07 new shoes, conditioned for winnin'
My lyrics unlimited, I got shit for the children
I got shit for the women, and if you ain't feelin' all the bars that I'm spillin'
I'll leave a lyrical puddle, you walk by and slip in it
Download my crack, I have you beggin'
?? to say I'm bootleggin'
If you want it that bad nigga, come get it
I spit premium rap, yo shit is unleaded
From the west to the east, I murder tracks;
I got producers putting vests on they beats, nigga

[Verse 2: Papoose]
Papoose, Pap...oose
Ay yo, Hot Rod, what up, my nigga
G-Unit, what up, if I loan you 20, you know you gotta gimme back 40
I feel like a, black democrat
Overthrowing these niggas' raps
Kill a track, fitted cap, sittin' over my wisdom black
Go get your gat, let's interact, I grip the mack
Represent for my homies, who in the can like Similac
The most powerful MC, that's just a fact
Al Sharpton asked me to march with him, how real is that
It's so easy to twist your cap
But a wise man told me it's more than two ways to skin a cat
So I just stand on the podium provin'
You claim to be king but it's only illusion
If you start somethin', gotta show me conclusion
You represent the phoniest movement
That's the same reason that you don't be improvin'
I take my time, y'all be rushin' like the Soviet Union
They talk tough to see you and give you a pound
That's why I tell 'em, pardon my left, and spin 'em around
I smoke the bubonic tonic, exotic, melodic
Brolic, bionic, psychotic, ironic, hypnotic kinda chronic
On every project, my object
Is make the product the hardest
Smartest comments, modest, honest, artist
New York is a caucus
I abolish, demolish, astonish, promise no college
Harvard is garbage, acknowledge homage to Farmers and Martyrs
Sick of these officers often causin' a coffin and walkin'
So I decided to comment and got responses from Congress
This is retarded, this nonsense, I make they officers varnish
Should've been cautious, they nauseous
Roll out the carpet, I walk in
Talkin' the talkin', enforcin'. I see they plot is demonic
But I can stop at the Prophet, cause I just watch it and drop it
No forty dollar deposit
Who let em outta the closet, they know my bars is symbolic
I drop the Islamic logic, yea, I show you how to hip-hop it
The Nacirema Dream, first quarter, go cop it
