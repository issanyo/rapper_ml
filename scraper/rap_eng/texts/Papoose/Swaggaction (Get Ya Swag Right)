[Verse 1]
You can't wear Gucci with Louis Vitton
That'd look corny
Get your swag right
You can't wear two watches at the same time
That'd look corny
Get your swag right
You can't wear cheap perfume, no please
You're making me sneeze
Get your swag right
You can't spit a verse and read it out of your phone
That'd look corny
Get your swag right
You can't wear a chain outside of your jacket
That'd look corny
Get your swag right
You can't wear shorts and a long sleeve shirt
That'd look corny
Get your swag right
You can't put new rims on an old car
That's so corny
Get your swag right
You can't wear uptowns more than once
I'll teach ya how
I'll teach ya
I'll teach ya how to stunt

[Hook]
Everybody swagger claimin

[Verse 2]
You can't wear fitted hats with the stickers on it
That'd look corny
Get your swag right
You can't go the bar and pop one bottle
That'd look corny
Get your swag right
You can't touch a stripper and not even tip her
That'd look corny
Get your swag right
You can't do your nails right and not do your toes
That'd look corny
Get your swag right
You can't get your hair done and wear tacky clothes
That'd look corny
Get your swag right
You can't wear fake shades, fake jewelry
That'd look corny
Get your swag right
You can't wear cheap cologne, no please
You're making me sneeze
Get your swag right
You can't wear a white tee more than once

I'll teach ya
I'll teach ya how to stunt
