[Verse 1:]
Ripping and running, I'm gripping the gun and you snitches
Get done and get hit your stomachs
Distributed dozens of bricks
And the butters I flip em and end up as rich
As a Drummond Shoving
The pedal it's touching the metal the blood of a rebel
Adrenaline rushing Too stubborn to settle for hustling for pebbles
You stuck on that level I've risen above it
Stop light and dry rotten, cock suckers, cock blocking
Cause my image is rugged My limit is greater
My dinner get catered, when tipping a waiter I give him a 100
La Copping, high riding with red in our eyes driving
All my niggas is bluntedGlocks cocking shots popping
Non-stopping, cops watching while I'm ripping the summons
2 to run fast I school 'em in class
Producing the math- give 'em the numbers
Dolce Dolce my convertible I'm such a monster
My grandfather live in a dungeon Damn this career & industry
I'm famous for smacking a man kissing woman
Like Leonidas told his fathers
We are taking everything from 'em
But giving 'em nothin Mask on my face ain't no Halloween
While y'all live on the throne, if I'm not the King
Bullets iron and blow off a lot of steam
Turn you into a vegetable collard greens
Bet that none of them realer than our team
Cause we spitting that crack that supply the fiends
Life is a gamble with dice I dismantle
Head crack and we taking a lot of cream Screaming out

[Chorus:]
Blow em Shake em Throw em Haaa [x8]

[Verse 2:]
Snake eyes I'ma take mine  4 5 6  you gonna die bitch
Throw a pound cake I'm taking wild cake
Roll a 4 or better I'm getting all the cheddar
Throw a tre-C you gon' hate me. She gon' burn you
Give you rabies Beat the deuce twice live the goon life
If I ace out, pull the thang out Straight innovator
Got greater and greater I'm raising the ways of the late Entertainer
Debating with haters if you ain't debating on
Making this paper then save it for later Strong rhymes
In the archives on my hard drives cause I'm saving the data
Sayers hating on my bread making I'm impregnating got my lady in labor
Raising the razor I'm blazing a traitor you 'traiting and
You should be facing your maker Hard times on the dark side
Of apartheid but I came here to save us Dawg's died
Mom's cried but I'm gon' rise didn't I say I'm the savior
You horrified! Born to ride  purified
Corner guys  invading the majors
Strong ties like the mob wives  I'm a shooter who shoots
Like he straight off the Lakers Y'all guys should apologize
For them false lines, imitating a gangster
I'm a tell you like they said in Sugar Hill
This is the flavor that we sell your neighbor
Rebels who putting the pedal to metal the level you devils will say and behavior
Back to back throw a head crack turning 10 stacks into 10 racks
6 trip's cello dead that, nigga said
They nice but they dead whack
Taking all bets y'all said that!
Infrared Mack leave him head tapped
Life is a gamble with dice I dismantle head crack and we taking the bread back
Screaming out

[Chorus]
