[Intro: Mavado]
Kill dem bumboclaat! Anywaaaayyyyyyyyy!!!! Gangsta for life!!!

[Papoose]
Aiyyo how that nigga 2Pac use to say it?! Yay Yay!!!!

[Mavado]
J.A. I'm reppin, twenty four seven
Everyday! I'm on top of my game!
Whoooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!
Everyday! I'm on top of my game!

[Verse 1: Papoose]
I'm on top of my game, liquor stores stop and pour
Henrock in my veins it's called stoppin the pain
Got more dollars to gain and your boppin to Wayne
But long as I entertain I'm 'gon pocket and bang
Cause man I rather be up, know I'm rockin them chains
Before I'm robbin for change in the world ridin the trains
Your thought process is lame your songs soundin the same
You floss bottomless fame and throw up shots and complain
Call me out of my name you gone out of your lane
Your mama could hang, call her Saddam Hussein
Gone coppin the 'caine, long drivin I'm grippin the four five in the range
More shots in your brain
They say the devil makin us all hot in the flames
Somebody tell me why is the lord watchin it rain
More shots in my thang, more dots in my aim
More rocks in my chain, on top I remain
THUG-A!!!!!

[Hook: Mavado]
B.K. where I'm reppin, twenty four seven
Everyday! I'm on top of my game!
Catch me on the block, with-out my Glock
Not! Everyday! I'm on top of my game!
Never catch me slippin, simply cause I'm grippin
Everyday! I'm on top of my game!
Whoooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!
Everyday! I'm on top of my game!

[Verse 2: Papoose (Mavado)]
While y'all in the crib watchin the playoffs
I'm on the back block with the strap lettin it ring off
Tellin him he nice you gassin him like Adolf (GANGSTA FOR LIFE!!!!)
Hitler like Nicolas Cage I'll take his (Face/Off)
Coppin smif and wess, let the Kanye off
Takin rich folks to the bank like Bernie Madoff
Stay strapped, finish one of these rappers
They know I stay with the strap like parts spelled backwards
Pound for pound Pacquiao and Chad Dawson boy!
Ask a couple of years back would've said I was goin with Roy
And Mayweather, I bet money on all them boys
Knuckle game ill beat niggas up way more than Floyd
Your talkin 'bout your team, stop it with all the noise
You was on the team but you was the waterboy
Thug-A-Thug-A! We them niggas they all avoid
Y'all played out like corduroys, on top of my game

[Hook: Mavado]
B.K. where I'm reppin, twenty four seven
Everyday! I'm on top of my game!
Catch me on the block, with-out my Glock
Not! Everyday! I'm on top of my game!
Never catch me slippin, simply cause I'm grippin
Everyday! I'm on top of my game!
Whoooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!
Everyday! I'm on top of my game!

[Bridge: Mavado]
Now before I buy the cash cause I still got the block
Mad Sadam on the block everydayyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!
Thug-A-Cation is the movement, and we got haters movin out of the wayyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!
(HEY!!!) I'm givin it to them! (HEY!!!) I'm givin it to them! (HEY!!!)
I'm givin it to them! (HEY!!!) I'm givin it to them! (HEY!!!)
I'm givin it to them! (HEY!!!) I'm givin it to them! (HEY!!!)

[Hook: Mavado]
B.K. where I'm reppin, twenty four seven
Everyday! I'm on top of my game!
Catch me on the block, with-out my Glock
Not! Everyday! I'm on top of my game!
Never catch me slippin, simply cause I'm grippin
