[Intro: Papoose]
You wanna go to war let's get it in
If war bring peace I'm with it then
I don't start beef I finish it
Ghetto soldiers we militant

[Bridge: Akon]
I don't like to fuss or fight, just tryin to live life right
Don't take my kindness for weakness cause I will take your life
First I will walk away, unless you push me to play
That's something I know you'll regret so please don't forget

[Hook: Akon]
I'm a ghetto soldier, desperado
I'm a ghetto soldier, my gun sing oh
I'm a ghetto soldier, how wise and cold
I'm a ghetto soldier, my mind sing oh (HEY!!!)

[Verse 1: Papoose
The soldiers get trained by the lieutenant
The lieutenant get all his orders from the Captain
General, when I was young I got drafted
Sent to the army of Brooklyn, those bastards
Fallen soldiers my homies lay in caskets
They couldn't survive the Heat just like the Mavericks
And I don't buy Wolf tickets from niggas
But niggers be wolfin so I walk around with my Clippers
Some of my people was alive for my struggle
But didn't live to see my success
They wanted to see me make it but got stripped naked
And laid in the morgue cause of death
So yo now that I'm successful how could I celebrate it
They died early so in their eyes I never made it
I ain't gonna give you my life you gotta take it
Soldier, I'm goin out blazin

[Hook: Akon]

[Verse 2: Papoose] (Akon)
We said the same thing at the same time I ain't knock on wood
Black cat crossed my path my luck's still good
Broke a mirror I ain't get seven years of bad luck
Nothin bad ain't even happened my left eye jumped
Put my hat on the bed when I walked in the room
Swept my feet and I didn't even spit on the broom
What I'm tryin to say is I'm not superstitious
Akon what am I? (I'm a Ghetto soldier)
My right hand itchin' been had money kid
I even opened the umbrella in the crib
Bought my girl some shoes she didn't walk out of my life
No bad luck I skipped the Po twice
No superstition just wise intuition
On the battlefield, get killed to do the killin
By the way my good luck charm is a biscuit
Ghetto soldier till the ending

[Hook: Akon]

[Verse 3: Papoose]
No pain no gain all the trauma is killin me
Pain can't swim that's why I drown in the Hennessy
Tied to the enemy run in your crib slump you in your fireplace
And have smoke comin out of your chimney
I can see straight through your plot and your trickery
It don't mean shit to me
I'm tryin to get to the bottom of it
But I lost a whole lot of my energy
Tryin to get to the bottom of a bottomless industry
Nowadays all I got is my pride and my dignity
You ridin with sympathy they say misery needs company
Why keep them company you kiddin me?
When I can grab a weapon and put him out of his misery
Send shots at you to tell you I'm not playing
When you fire back you let me know what you saying
This gun bustin it's like an unspoken language
We communicate with our gun this shit is dangerous

[Hook: Akon]
