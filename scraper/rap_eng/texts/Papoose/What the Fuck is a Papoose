DJ Kay Slay, the Drama King
I'm in the building wit' my nigga Papoose
And all y'all rap niggas know you can't fuck around

[Talking]
All you hear all day
Papoose this, Papoose that
Who is this guy man?
Who is Papoose?

[Hook]
His presence alone is a threat to these rap groups
This cat's loose, yo what the fuck is a papoose?
I heard his street soldiers is wild and clap troops
This cat's loose, yo what the fuck is a papoose?
I heard him on a mixtape tearin' the track loose
What the fuck is a papoose?

[Papoose]
I'm the number one rapper ready for challengers
Who the fuck calculated your algebra?
My ineffiecient, unfascinated ambassadors
I'm the first king, them faggots dated your calendar
Rappin' since my forefather ejaculated in Africa
Way ahead of headline, agentators and characters
Heads like yours get decapitated in anarca
Prison's uncaptivated the wilder cause
Guns run in my family, even got gats related to silencers
Cop chasers assasinatin' my stanima
Load guns like computers so I activated my caliber
Killers walk around dirty, when the gun blast
I'll give 'em lead showers, make 'em take a bloodbath
To blow trial, 1-8-7 is thug math
Real thugs laugh and hawk spit in the judge' glass
In jail CO's walk around like zookeepers
My niggas been to the ??? more than a schoolteacher
Broke the court's law, I threw a brick off the fourth floor
Outweighed cops, I'm harcore, they softcore
Four walls, my gun-game is raw dog
While y'all shootin' videos I'm shootin' .44's
Life achiever, lifetime life achiever
And I use flames from hell to ignite my cheeba
It's never been nothin' pretty when I light this heater
If God don't like ugly, I don't like him neither
Niggas quick to flip, claimin' they run wit' a killer click
They be flippin' scripts, callin' police and givin' tips
Click the fifth when the last nigga snitched (*click-click*)
You would've thought he swallowed semen
The way I had him shittin' bricks
Judges want to sit on they butts and rule other brothers
So I show the butt of my gun and more cops suffer
My platoon rocks suckers, you dudes cop lovers
In your boombox, whose rock, Boondocks knuckles
East, West, niggas know me when I'm holdin' the mic
Got them down south niggas sayin' "Wodie you nice!"
Time's apployal, a prophet could define tommorrow
Knowledge is food for thought so I wisely swallow
Never say never mind, so respect the mind that got you
Forever clever mind, so the nevermind we bobble
Is it me or nowadays everybody macho
New Jack hustlers, niggas called Pabey Pancho
But we're strong, I've been coppin' so long
We on a first name basis, so now I call Pabey, Pablo
And I don't leave leads for F.B.I. to follow
41 shot's, leave me like that guy Dialo
Say bullets don't got a name but I sign these hollows
Y'all niggas is suicide, we homo(homocide)
Keep a Y.G. model, if I get put in a coma don't supply me sorrow
Pour hennessey in my I.V. bottle
Cause I represent everything in existence trying to grow

[DJ Kay Slay]
Yo what the fuck is a papoose?

[Papoose]
I don't know

[Hook]

[DJ Kay Slay]
I bet you motherfuckers know
What the fuck a papoose is now!
Bitch ass niggas, let's go!
