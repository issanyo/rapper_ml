[Chorus:]
Are you like a bitch you draggin it
Talking about oh shit you draggin it
Tell them long ass hoe you draggin it
Shut the fuck you shawty you draggin it

[Verse 1:]
I don't respect your crime scene ain't no red tape
Yeah those niggers getting money but they fed bate
The rapper ate his words watch him swallow it first
On the block all night cause tomorrow the first
You can't take that money with you stop starving with thirst
I never saw a brick truck follow a hearse
Put your dogs in the ground Micheal Vicks
Punch a nigga in his mouth on some high school shit
Instagram thugs mad i don't like their pics
You can't get a like from me because i don't like you bitch
I in grade school why you still running around in the panel squeezes
So the dean use to say my name on the loud speakers
Every other day new clothes and glasses nigga
Now I’m into popping calls for wild features
And why your own niggers run the game wild geezers
Man because I’m getting all the cheese they don't feed her
Yeah the summer is mine the crowd pleaser
I lock you you from august to july ain't no one seen ya
Rumble with the cops put them down and drop boy
Pepper spray the cops try to mase me like bad boy
Don perry my whole squad my whole squad
Man i carry G since your baby moms met me
They say they gone with me i got them long semi
I was squeezing that ratchet until the crons empty
Is the Gone ready man i was born ready
I’m sick with the flow there’s something wrong with me
Oh i got chrome with more beef than 5 guys in protected custody
You signed in like wifi

[Chorus]
