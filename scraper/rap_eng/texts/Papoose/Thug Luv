[Chorus: Ray J]
Baby girl want some of that (Thug love)
So I'm a give her that (Thug love)

All her life runnin 'round down (With a scrub)
But now she wants that (Thug love)
She say she needs that  (Thug looooovvvvvveeeee!!!!)

[Verse One: Maino]
Come on! Feel like I rule the world (World)
Princess, diamonds and pearls
I need a bitch not a innocent girl, you follow me girl
Get deeper, caramel features
Look at how she walk she a diva
Louis and this, Fendi and that, twirl with a beamer
Supermodel chick man I bag at your sneakers
Talk slick when she run her lips I beat her
Act right yeah damn right I'd eat her
No wedding ring, just some tattoos
Of my name on her chest and her ankles
She loves me, you could never tell her I ain't that dude
Yeah I been to jail, and she knows what I've been through
I got her wide open that's what a thug do
I'm in the hood like bitches wearin Ugg boots
I tell her war stories, she loves my war scars
This is thug love, and she my world y'all

[Chorus: Ray J] (*Papoose)
Baby girl want some of that (Thug love)

And I'm a give it to her

[Verse Two: Papoose]
Them lame dudes ain't lovin you right
You feelin lonely, you need a thug in your life
(Yes!) You need a man with knowledge and self
Champion Lover, I'm rockin the belt
Wanna go clubbin, I won't beef
I'm a freak in the bedroom, but I'm not a control freak
(Uh!) She can't take yo' place
Her Louis bag wack and her UGG boots fake {*girl giggles*}
Spaghetti with no onions
She got pretty feet, toes with no bunions
She'll put her feet in that food, I'll love it
She know the way to a man's heart is his stomach
...You got what I want
I ain't stressin if it's that time of the month
It might sound nasty, but if the cops ain't in sight
I'll look both ways, then I'll run the red light

[Chorus: Ray J] (*Red Cafe)
Baby girl want some of that (Thug love)
So I'm a give her that (Thug love)
Yeah! She needs that (Thug looooovvvvvveeeee!!!!) Yeeeeaaaaahhhhhhhh!!! Yeah!
All her life runnin 'round down (With a scrub)
But now she wants that (Thug love)
She say she needs that  (Thug looooovvvvvveeeee!!!!) (*It's R!!!!)

[Verse Three: Red Cafe]
Hey Pretty Young Thing (*Wassup?) Meet the King
I'm from the borrough of kings doin my thug thing
And I rock bling, and I gets moolah (What else??)
My dick's bigger than your 12-inch ruler (WHAT ELSE??)
Big chain like Slick Rick Ruler
In the club, it's swingin like that jeweler
Shorty brain good (yep), she gon' be my tutor (yep)
So I'm obligated, I GOTTA DO 'ER!
In the back seat, in the front seat
She ain't gotta pay me, it's all courtesy
(Yep!) This me R, Shakedown muscle (Who?)
Deliver that good fix makin the yay bubble (What else??)
Damn right, if the head game right
You can have whatever you like, er'ry night (WHAT ELSE??)
And I'ma knock it down with my Timbs on
I'm on my big love shit, bring your friends on

[Verse Four: Ray J]
Oooh! Baby on the grind for me, even do some time for me
Even tell some lies for me, thug looooovvvvvveeeee!!!!
Yeah! She like to buy me shoes at Gucci
And her favorite gun is the Uzi (She got that)
And she like to have fun in Jacuzzi's, thug looooovvvvvveeeee!!!!

[Chorus: Ray J]
Baby girl want some of that (Thug love)
