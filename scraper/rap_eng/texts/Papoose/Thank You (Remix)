[Papoose:]
My cell phone ringing, I ain't receiving no calls
I get a bad signal when I be in the mall
She say where you at? I was leaving a stall
She slammed it but I put my feet in the door
Her body was appeasing and pure
Her crib so clean you can eat off the floor
She picked up a book when she reached in the drawer
She a smart woman like finna she call
We argue and never lead to a war
We agree to disagree and that's all
If your man keep bringing up your past
Don't be with him girl
If he accepted that what he bring it up for
Your girl cheat on you so you cheat on your girl
Play tit for tat just to even the score
Gotta focus on the future to achieve in this world
Never hateful, forever thankful

Sometimes I wonder do you
Even recognize the woman
That's standing in front of you

Listen, sometimes I wonder do you
Even care or realize why I took care of you
Cause you're my heart
You are my soul
You're my other half
Without you I cannot be whole baby

So far apart
I just don't know
What drove us apart in the first place
Now I know baby
Why

These tears I cry sure won't be the last
They will not be the last, no
Cause this pain inside never seems to pass
It never seems to pass me by

So I thank you
Said I thank you
Yes I thank you
For making me a woman

Sometimes I wonder could she be
More of a woman to you than you were a man to me
Listen, sometimes I wonder, why me
I'm here miserable while you're out living your fantasies
And didn't care

Cause you're my heart
You are my soul
You're my other half
Without you I cannot be whole baby
So far apart
I just don't know
What drove us apart in the first place
Now I know baby
Why

These tears I cry sure won't be the last
They will not be the last, no
Cause' this pain inside which never seems to pass
It never seems to pass me by

So I thank you
Said I thank you
Yes I thank you
For making me a woman
