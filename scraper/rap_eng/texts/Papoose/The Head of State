[Hook]
The head of state is lyin’
‘Cause the world is multiplyin’
A hundred men are dying
Mothers home are crying
Families die

[Verse 1 – Papoose]
They charge Russell Simmons, say he ain't register as a lobbyist
Bloomberg make a million a week—he's a communist
Show Saddam's sons on TV.  Who’s watchin’ it?
Udai and Kusai’s alive, they trick knowledges
Sayin’, “We'll decrease the killing”—that's they analysis
Words to increase the killin’ was spoke Arabic
Shot Davis right where he stand, they surrounded him
In city hall, they murdered a black city councilman
Say Al Sharpton sold drugs they provided him
Presidential race we faced, they took him out of it
Say they liberating Iraq, but that's abolishment
Now they celebrating ‘cause oil was they accomplishment
Look at your 20 dollar bill, no astonishment
4,000 jews don't show up, and now we tower-less?
Put a flag on Saddam's head, I'm tired of this
Without justice, we powerless

[Hook x2]
The head of state is lyin’
‘Cause the world is multiplyin’
A hundred men are dying
Mothers home are crying
Families die

[Verse 2 – Saigon]
Look, we live in the day where most hoes go both ways
It's so craze, America love to promote gay
Coke still come in both ways.  They locked my man John Forté
Them bitches need to be blown away
For takin’ the stand, and takin’ a man
Who was only tryna to get a lil’ cake in his hand
They don't talk about how he was invested in stock
All they do is lock us up, while the rest of us watch
And listen up—I'll tell you how the system is corrupt
How it takes a black man and kicks him in the butt
So when he hit the streets and see guns, he picks ‘em up
And if he sees some people with funds, he sticks ‘em up
Then he ends up locked up in the stock
Cracker put him there, but still he blamin’ the block
Instead of readin’ books, he joined a gang at a stop
Now he runnin’ ‘round the yard with the ox in his buttocks

[Hook x2]
The head of state is lyin’
‘Cause the world is multiplyin’
A hundred men are dying
Mothers home are crying
Families die

[Verse 3 – Papoose]
I been around so much robbery, larceny, and poverty
The average cypher couldn't revolve with me
Rhyming genius and design speeches like choreography
What you study hard to be?
My kind of rhyme don't got no bottom line ‘cause I come deeper then Scientology
Philosophies logically written in glossaries
I could take on a armory and face a army with a pen in the palm of me
Word to the bond of me, honestly
In my Bone Thug and artery, harmony's part of me
Flow remarkably, but understand it's some art from me
It's complicated like living Islamicly without equality
So I make my listeners see pictures just like photography
Moves rap like majority.  I'm the son of song biologically
The fatherly artistry fathered me and comfortably
Saw beyond degrees.  Y'all believe what's too hard to see
Masters of visions, so my path is to listen
Don't question my wisdom, I'm origin—ask your religion

[Verse 4 – Saigon]
It's a very beautiful thing when you can bring truth to the light
Spit hardness and still get the youth to unite
It ain't one rapper out now maneuverin’ right
Your ice is nice, but what you tryna do for the fight?
You gon' play pussy or play dog?
I'mma make the D.J play songs for y’all that made it to the morgue
You gotta understand the situation we placed in
Malcolm got murdered—we never got his replacement
It kinda make sense why niggas’ll wet your face in
For something as stupid as chasin’ a reputation
Saigon was gun man, I can bust a sawed-off shotgun with one hand
Give you a quick suntan
Yea, real recognize real
All I recognize when I look in your eyes is the god of the squeal
Son, I’m ill like the shit MacGyver could build
Treat you and your troops like the hoop when I deposit the pill
