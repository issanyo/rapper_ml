[Bridge 1: Papoose]
I carry the thing in my Gucci belt
I look at the world through my Gucci glasses
I carry a bird in my Louie bag
You give me 42 stacks, you can have it
I got the baking soda in my 'frigerator
I got the ziplock bags in my cabinet
I’m riding with thugger in that new whip
We see our enemies then we stop in traffic
Bitch nigga get at me!

[Verse 1: Papoose]
Mama ain’t raised no savage
But if you owe me you better pay yo' balance
The Brooklyn niggas, they so valid
You a deadbeat shooter, ain’t man enough to raise yo ratchet
Screaming you the best but you ain’t no Khaled
I got a bird in my car and it ain’t no parrot
Big homie, that ain’t yo status
I got them clips on my hip and they ain’t no malice

[Hook]
Bitch nigga get at me, yeah
Bitch nigga get at me, yeah
Bitch nigga get at me, yeah
Bitch nigga get at me, huh
I’m reppin' my gang, yea (I’m flaggin')
I’m reppin' my gang, yea (I’m flaggin')
I’m reppin' my gang, yea (wave yo flag)
I’m reppin' my gang, yea (wave yo flag)
Bitch nigga get at me, yeah

[Bridge 2: Papoose]
I be in the club throwin bottles up
We getting money, I be where them stacks be
Bitch boy say they wanna do something
But they never ever get at me
If I ain’t in the heads up I’m on Lafayette
It ain’t hard to find Mr. Maggy
Bitch boy say they wanna do something
But they never ever get at me
Bitch nigga get at me!

[Verse 2: Papoose]
Pop hammers, fly clothes watch wearer
IPhone 5 cameras, my flows got clearer
Grind hella, dime scrambler, I am a wise planner
None of yall drop grammar like the man in my mirror
Yacht seller, shop blammer, cop scarer
Turn this track to a deadbeat like a man who can’t buy Pampers
Cursed like a song bitch, motherfucker, goddamner
Man I run this shit, like my plans, so tell 'em get at me

(Hook)
Bitch nigga get at me, yeah
Bitch nigga get at me, yeah
Bitch nigga get at me, yeah
Bitch nigga get at me, huh
I’m reppin my gang, yeah
I’m reppin my gang, yeah
I’m reppin my gang, yeah
I’m reppin my gang, yeah
Bitch nigga get at me
