They think they the only ones getting that aye money
They think they the only ones getting that weed money
They think they the only ones getting that show money
We gettin' it too
Nigga we getting it too
Tell 'em niggas we getting it too
Bitch we getting it too
Tell them bitches we getting it too

Niggas ain't riding with me
They don't dig me it's cool
Deep down inside they always wanted Willie to lose
In the strip club we ain't putting them jewels
I keep the ratchet on me they can't never stick me in suze
I play hockey with the greedious dudes
'Cause I went to the spot where mama sent me to school
They sellin' 5 8's put the semi to cruise
I had to shoot 'em so my 12 - 12 skinny could move
I ain't as silly as you
I be on my grizzly you on your Winnie the Pooh
A dare nigga try to give me the blues
That Mr. T shit, I pity the fool
I keep the rides go full
We not know sheeps, and they not know wolves
We in that rose more, I'm so full
Man I got more rose than the Chicago Bulls

They think they the only ones getting that aye money
They think they the only ones getting that weed money
They think they the only ones getting that show money
We gettin' it too
Nigga we getting it too
Tell 'em niggas we getting it too
Bitch we getting it too
Tell them bitches we getting it too
