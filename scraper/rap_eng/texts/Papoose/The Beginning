[Verse 1: Papoose]
I woke up in the morning with my dick in my hand
Morning wood God damn
Then I brush my teeth
I take a shower, then I eat and hit the spot
Put on a fresh new fit
Now I'm fly walking with a bop
Grab the wop
Place it on my hip, never slip
I heard you talking shit
But when you answer have the same energy
Don't answer if the call unknown
Never Android I be on the iPhone
I'm still the king of the underground
Don't fuck around
Gotta get rid of me if you want the crown
Lotta styles
Before release date I get the sneakers
Used to weigh my work on a scale like a libra
None of ya'll lames can fuck with Pap
Call 'em savages and tell 'em that God's back
I used to ride the train with a token
Now I'm in the droptop
You niggas see me how I'm rolling

[Chorus: Papoose]
This is where New York city begins
Cuban links, Yankee fitted hats and Timbs
Pot holes but we still ride rims
Every borough got beef, we ain't got no friends
Dope in the rice, Uncle Bens
Doing pullups on a pole, we ain't got no gym
Out of towners tell 'em come on in
Lay 'em in a blood pool hope you niggas can swim

[Verse 2: Papoose]
That Flex freestyle opened the door, I made an entrance
Operation get hot again, my favorite mission
The rappers at the top of the game afraid to listen
Cause their entire discography just ain't convincing
You mumble rappers ain't payed your dues, pay admission
If you ain't got it just pay half, I pay the difference
Gun game they play it nice, I play it wicked
Niggas know I stay with the Smith like Jada Pinkett
Sneaking niggas think just because they creeps
They could outsmart real niggas, fuck they think
I leave him laying in his wake on a Monday sleep
For coming at me sideways on a oneway street
Niggas think that cause they be working out that they could bitch cats
You think you could stop a bullet with your six pack
And I heard he be telling
Man I ain't with that
He work out and he snitch
Guess that make him a gym rat

[Chorus: Papoose]
This is where New York city begins
Cuban links, Yankee fitted hats and Timbs
Pot holes but we still ride rims
Every borough got beef, we ain't got no friends
Dope in the rice, Uncle Bens
Doing pullups on a pole, we ain't got no gym
Out of towners tell 'em come on in
Lay 'em in a blood pool hope you niggas can swim
