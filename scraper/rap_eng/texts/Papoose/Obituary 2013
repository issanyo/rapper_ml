Put yo peace signs up, keep yo hands steady
This is the 2013 obituary

(Verse 1)
Nelson Mandela is accolades various
South African, anti-apartheid, revolutionary
Born July 18th, 1918
Born leader, philanthropist, a true king
Served 27 years in prison, what was his crime?
Guilty for fighting against apartheid
Injustice memories, they sent a fake interpreter to his memorial to overshadow his legacy
The cause of his death, respiratory infection
Our first president, not Obama, correction
Paul Walker, talented actor
In all of his movies he played memorable characters
Born September 12th, 1973
Did commercials as a child, born for TV
Fast and Furious entirely
He died in a car accident, tragic dramatic irony

(Hook)
Stress free, no worries
Life’s too short to be livin it in a hurry
Put yo peace signs up, keep yo hands steady
This is the 2013 obituary

Risin star, yet to have better days
Won a Golden Globe Award

None of us are promised tomorrow, that’s a fact
Chris Kelly, a young life lost

(Verse 3)
Strong, where do I begin?
My brother, my other half, my best friend
Born August, I’m lost for words to be true
We was raised in Brooklyn, New York, me and you
Left hand, the location tattoo
In his veins the same blood as Papoose
Thought I would be reciting this song so you can hear it
Never thought I would be writing a song with you in it
RIP to Doe B
Jerry Boss, Roger E, Bird and Kachi
RIP to ST
RIP, the stars don’t stop
RIP Jean Stapleton
Jim Kelly for comeback, he always ready
2013 obituary I swear
I hope I don’t have to do this again next year

(Interlude)
When I die I want a rapper to do a song like this for me man
It gotta be somebody with talent though, I don’t respect artists without talent
I just don’t want no fake DJs doing no tributes, no tributes please
Cuz you ain’t salute a nigga when he was alive
Allow my words to haunt you
Say farewell to 2013 yall
Farewell 2013, farewell

(Verse 4)
Middle finger to 2013, you made us suffer
Still can’t believe you murdered my little brother
Pain in the voice and eyes of our mothers
Fatherless son but his uncle gon make him suffer
Tried to kick us while we down, took him from us
But you can’t keep us down, he’s still above us
Jail ain’t that bad, it’s something that been full
If they tryin to leave you with nothing to live for
Everybody’s so full of hate, what’s this for?
I smoked with Sun Tzu, he told me it’s war
A man who goes to bed with a book never goes to bed alone
Good literature, signing off, my signature

Pa-poose, Pa-poose
