[Hook]
(I wish a nigga would)
Diamonds in my jewelry, lot of money in my pocket
Haters claiming they could stop it
(I wish a nigga would)
Moving like I'm Gotti, shoot them down and catch a body
Pray to God somebody try me
(I wish a nigga would)
Lou Vutton shoe, Godfather Part 2
Y'all want to rob who?
(I wish a nigga would)
Rack on racks and there's facts in my raps
And they gonna clap, pap
(I wish a nigga would)

[Verse 1]
I came to stack scriller, wax spitter
Getting money fast nigga, you a fucking caterpillar
(I wish you would)
I'm a track killer, cap peeler
Mad realer, crack dealer, moving white, Mac Miller
(I wish you would)
I've been a cash getter, stash spender
Bag winner, autograph giver, haters mad bitter
(I wish you would)
Lobster and crab dinner, eating like a fat nigga
Wool grain in my car, catch feelings
(I wish a nigga would)
Got a mac with an extended clip
Make your head trimmer, back shiver, nap giver
(I wish you would)
Organized crime staff member, black glove
Black love, black bottle, black liquor
(I wish you would)
I'm a lead track, you an ad-libber
Big rock fast flipper, Ziploc bag sealer
(I wish you would)
7 5 8 bay hit fitted
Bag chipper, [?] an ass kisser, blast triggers

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Assassin, blasting music in the Aston
Martin out the dock but the car go [?]
Gassing, pressing on the pedal, I'll be mashing
Shorty suck my dick, but I ain't eat it, I be fasting
Robbers on my ass, so I flash when I'm passing
Flyer than a motherfucking cockpitted cabin
Stopped in the traffic and hopped out the wagon
Cocking and blasting, shots in Manhattan
Had to reach down in my boxers to grab it
Gun so big that it popped the elastic
Walked through metal detectors, cop couldn't catch it
Man they would've had me if the Glock wasn't plastic
Boy I'm going straight to the top with this rap shit
Every single song I ever dropped was a classic
I don't even want your little spot, you can have it
Yeah I know you think you have it locked [?]
