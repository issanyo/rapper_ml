[Intro]
Everybody wanna be up
But they don't see bucks
Cos' they rather go shopping
They don't never re-up
When they make they rounds
Them niggas get laid down
Cos you run into the same people on the way down

[Verse]
It feels good to be an elite spitter, I think bigger
All of these rappers my kids, I need a sitter
You lames on a menu this summer, won't see winter
Say my grace, then I go in the booth and eat dinner
Your eyes roll back in your head, your feet shiver
When I snatch the life out of your body, complete killer
He just hating on my name cos' he bitter
Till they found his body floating at Harlem, east river
Shopping in the city, spending my racks
You think I'm slipping, are you stupid? You fell in my trap
45' by my nuts, I step on my strap
I'm on Saks Fifth, I got the fifth next to my sack
You're only real when it's peace
You're a punk when it's war
If you ain't scared to wear your chain
What you tucking it for?
With knives they don't represent
I've done it before
Pulling the Tec' out the dresser
Got the gun in the drawer
Got your team on zip
We coming to score
Catch him hanging on the corner
Make him run in the store
Cock it back, point blank, pump one in your jaw
Now every thing you eat gotta come through a straw
Hustled in a coke spot, we was pumping em' raw
The customers used to slide the money under the door
I knew I could kill this beat, but I wasn't too sure
[?] convinced me, only did it for my brother-in-law
Run up on me with a mask
Then he better be trick-or-treating
Loose lips sink ships, reason your ships sinking
Niggas hate me but can't give a legit reason
They will never pass me cos' they tryna' get even
Lames wanna talk, fuck a talk, I'm sick of meetings
I don't wanna talk, when I see you I'm just squeezing
Leaved you slumped with a shit bag, ya wig leaking
Every time you try to take a piss, your dick bleeding
You a follower, but you gon' be in a ditch sleeping
Cos' them lame niggas that you follow be misleading
Violate in the morning, we clapping them this evening
Adrenaline rush and I feel a pulse in my wrist beating
Niggas so nosy, when you talk they be lip reading
Don't stick your two cents in when my clicks speaking
You always bigging niggas up, screaming they clique eating
You call it giving compliments, I call it dick eating
