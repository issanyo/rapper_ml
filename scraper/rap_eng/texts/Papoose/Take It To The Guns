[Intro]
Breath heavy got that haze in my lungs
I ain't nothin but a raisen in the sun
Ma fuckers dont be playin whare im from
Think its a game when can take it to the guns
Cops comin then im blazin that them
They wanna put me in the cage here they come
Mother fuckers dont be playin Wea im from
Think its a game we can take it to the guns

[Chorrus]
Born in the gutter, raised in the slums
I dont like talkin we can take it to the guns
Got a problem with somethin im sayin to you son
Take it how you want it, we can take it to the guns

Born in the gutter, raised in the slums
I dont like talkin we can take it to the guns
Yea you beside me and now you playin with my guns
Im a take you to blood, we can take it to the guns

[Verse 1]
I dunno what they doin over there
But guns go off over here
I dont no if they shoot fair ones or shake hands over there
But guns go off over here
I dunno if they from outta town or if they lost over there
But homie this New York over here, get Off'd over here
No workers the boss over here, we dont go get guns, we walk wit em, yea
I dont no what they say in them courts over there
But ain't no body soft over here, get offed over here
Dont no body talk over here
We take ourtime and go up north over here
Everybody always say chill let it slide
Niggas violate you when they say let it ride
Ride or die niggas never hide
And the ones who always say let it ride, they never ride
So quick to swear on who ever died
Swearin on your man and you no you just lied
But you shouldn't take a mans pride
Niggas take kindness for weakness
Thats why im never kind
Always seen things comin i was never blind
To me its 13 0'clock im ahead of time
I no you through my man so you ain't no friend of mine
Hit you 7 times wit the barretta 9
O parden yourself i make you say it 7 times
14 a hundred shot mac multiplies
Spoke with gang sign language, said slice pack
I spoke with body language and gave him his knife back
So dont ever ask why im takin it like that
Because i took it how you put it, now take it right back

[Verse 2]
I smoke a large portion for cheaper

My gun game sick like a cough and fever
Niggas straight birds like a hawk and geizer
But they run on you like a horse and a cheetah
We real niggas so when we walk through they great us
Pull over and talk to us egor
Why your man keep pealin off when he see us
He one of them hot head niggas, He'll cool off in the freezer
Thats my word i chase his boss out his sneakers
The nigga ran so fast he lost his adidas
Even as a student had the force of a leader
Talked to teachers with thoughts of a thinker
Me and him strong side by side, dont try to walk in between us
Even stand beside us or lay underneath us
Jackson like michael, flip keys like alicia
Pull mats like burney to get friends like aretha
Pigs playin for keps, them hogs wanna keep us
Because we walk the walk and talk with the nina
Im tossin the heata, i ain't tryin to get cought without it
But i ain't tryin to get cought with it neither

[Verse 3]
You dont really wanna take it there, us real dudes smell fear
All the crack heads say they love you when you let em get by
All they really love is crack, they just wanna get high
In my hood they dont care about a couple of chumps
When the gun boys come, all they want is them guns
But when the narcs snatch you up, it shatter dreams
Because they bag you and bag a fein
The judge threw the book at my man, we had a team
Judges like throwin books, thats why i throw magazines
Yall got a lotta drama and a lil nina, ya grills gotta get a lil meana
If i wanna say xxxx you, i ain't gunna give you the middle finger
Real niggas say xxxx you with the triger finger
Run on your block and hit you like a bolita
I toke ninas and poke feevers, and park rims for you
Scheme and plot smart schames for you
After they bang with you they call the man on you
He snitchin on his own colors, smart man for you
The white man cought you becuse the dark man saw you
Heard when they hoped outta that dark van on you
Your whole fear bounced, even your ark ran on you
What you expect niggas to spark candals for you
That gun ain't jammed on you, your hearts jammed on you
Spoke with gang sign language, said slice pack
I spoke with body language and gave him his knife back
Dont ever ask why im takin it like that
I took it how you put it, now take it right back

I lost a whole lotta homies to the gun
Killas will chase you to ya grave if you run
20 ta life they ain't playin wit you son
So think befor you take it to the gun
