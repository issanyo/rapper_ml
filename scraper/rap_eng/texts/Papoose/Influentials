[Verse 1:Remy Ma]
I got the city in a frenzy
Everybody wanna know what it's really bout
Every ear waiting to hear whats gone come outta Remy mouth
I'm like a bad blood stain
Niggas can't get me out
I ain't no sidekick bitch
I ain't just flipping out
You tell me suck your dick
I ain't saying whip it out
I'm emptying the whole fucking clip in your zipper now
You can't reproduce anymore bastards or bitches now
I paid more dues than a college student
I'm just tryna reap what I sow like the farmers do it
And this shit ain't gone move itself,nigga I'ma move it
And send anybody tryna stop me to the trauma unit
(Fast) I ain't gotta prove my points
Cause all of them is hollow tip
I'm the Queen of New York, it ain't got shit to do with politics
I'm dead nice I dont know what to say no more
They like Rem why you dont come around the way no more?
I'm like cuz muhfuckas hate, I might have to break a jaw
It seem like the whole hood cooperating with the law
I'm riding dirty, license suspended like it ain't no more
Probably a car full of niggas that all spray that 4
Chicks see me like "damn Rem don't fuck with bitches at all"
I don't fuck with bitches of course , cause bitches is whores (sluts)
It's not just the black girls all these bitches is lost
Puerto Rican , Asian, Caucasian, Dominican broads
But truthfully to me see, dudes is the worst
With ya half a hairline and ya dirty white shirt
How this nigga straight bird on his Nextel chirp?

[Verse 2:Papoose]
Why would I walk past you and bump you
Talk past you and mumble
I could walk past you rush grab you and touch you
They movin indirect my Ave. is a jungle
But I approach him real calm, my swagger is humble
Like pardon me homie, I ain't tryna gather no trouble
But I'm actually puzzled
Why you keep crackin your knuckles?
These niggas is funny so I laugh and just chuckle
On my lap got the mac with the muzzle
It take business to move me, it take real women to soothe me
Wanna spend some time, won't spend it with poosey
That's the same reason I can't get with these groupies
My girl got more credit then the end of the movie
Bonafied killa, you spoken lie listener
Stop stealin my rhymes, yous a stolen line spitter
Take a flake by myself, holdin my liquor
These ugly ass rappers can't pose in my picture
Element of surpise, I don't notify niggas
I pulverize niggas
I went from A to Z, you could call me A-Z
Do or die nigga, drop notarized scriptures
They open eyes quicker
Grimy war in 94'
Unloading 9 gripper
Nine copper, nine fiver, gun totin, nine sixer
Son lockin, cut throats n' bust open yall niggas
2000 and 6 still holdin my trigger
Unfolded my temper
If you tell your fam, you wanna ride on his man
He supposed to ride with you
Blood and water don't coincide nigga
But you tryna stop me from ridin like "no that's my nigga"
When they don't want me to ride I override ni**az
