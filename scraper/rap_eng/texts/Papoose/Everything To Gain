[Verse 1:]
Am representing the show biz poverty
To the sewer, rats and roaches the blind
To ones that got to rebuild homes with a polive
Building collapsing gas leaks explosives
Thats right those gas pipes probably running through your houses
God bless the ghetto where role models will show kids
The images in my chain can cross waters with no bridge
Police brutality and leaving niggers with slow biz
The Rodney King black eye blues outrageous and broke ribs
Crack did to the 80’s what the 70’s cope did
Molly’s doing right now what the 90’s dope did
And for real the pocket hold up who needs a break
All black binoculars staking and not where you lay your head
Met the dawn users who dawn easy they need to meds
Cash dont give a to who gave his opponent a decent edge
Bubble gums souls and air bubbles sneaker head
And green shoes and Gucci loafers
Green and red its DMX and belly who wear a wig Like dread
Woke up on your car with gunfire and leave you dead
52 slap boxes knuckle game that beat you head
Give you bruises and knocks the size of easter egg
Talk on the phones you better remember everything
I never med a mother fucker who beat the feds
To pay your lawyer that's the best advice
I rather spend the rest of my money
Rather than the rest of my life

[Chorus:]
I think like a G when I’m busting my move
Everything in the game nothing to lose
My back against the walls I’m a punish these fools
Everything to gain nothing to lose
These niggers should have never given me nothing to prove
Everything to gain nothing to lose
Even when my back against the walls I’m a punish these fools
Everything to gain nothing to lose

[Verse 2:]
Its real hip hop microphone and turntables
Showing these J’s the definition of hip hop
Say they sell crack them niggers selling the whip whop
Our things look like poogi from new Jack Chris Rock
Piss inside a bottle and got out of the wick wack
Road to the riches and we ain't even pulling over for no pitstop
At the crab table I’ll leaving with a big Knock
Running through casino just the night when the hit two pack
I can't rise resurrection to hip hop
Long live the night you kissed death and got lippop
Come around here with that chain get your shit popped
So like the next president that  the knicks got
Ices out brightly and rollers don't tack tock
The arnext told president out shining you wrist watch
Poet scare i’m with the desert eagle
Creeping keep and see creep and kill like richard the referee

[Chorus]
