In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things will get pretty strange

You don't get stepped on
Slip away teflon
Get stepped get shop
Leave you with their chest gone get hit by the best on
Every time you leave girl you gotta put your vest on
We playing their reaction
That's just how it is man anything can happen
Leave once come back again
Pigs on a huns sniffing out drug traffic again
In a New York minute
Surely been the same man
Watch where you step getting caught up in the game land
In a New York minute
You ride for your brothers
Been it for mainly what you die for your colors
In a New York minute
Hold your own blast out people fresh off head back to the crack house
In a New York minute
This shit is not a game
Getting knocked out here if you don't use your brain

[Hook: x2]
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things will get pretty strange

Picture me rolling in the mase'
Cops wanna stop me, why?
'Cause I'm a king like Rodney
We used to murder for a hobby
Press the intercone walk right in the building and spray the lobby
But now I move more wisely our past is behind me
I'm an ex murderer like Ashanti
I'm stomping through the city like Godzilla
Question, why am I still breathing if y'all killers
In a New York minute
We be sipping that hard liquor shooter
I make them hit the deck like a card dealer
In a New York minute
Take an open shot like Arm Miller
Indiana pace 'em more shots then a bartender
In a New York minute
They be claiming they cross gripers
They a bunch of barbies Nicki Minaj niggas
In a New York minute
We too authentic
Give it to a niggas in a new york minute

[Hook: x2]
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things will get pretty strange
