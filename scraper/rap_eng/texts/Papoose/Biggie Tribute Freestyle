Sometimes I have deep thoughts when I be in my whip
Thinking about Remy, just me and my bitch
MTV made a list, I wanna discuss
None of them artists was from Brooklyn, we left in the dust
They never rode the 8-train or the 24-bus
They all sus, them niggas bleed just like us
How they spit crack? Their coke never expanded
Them niggas better learn the Ten Crack Commandments
Gun charge at a young age, they locked me up
Cause I was hypnotized by Machine Gun Funk
What goes around comes around, you don't get away with nothing
You gotta face the consequence like Joe Budden
If New York niggas keep rapping like they from Miami
I ain't going back to Cali, I'm going back to Cali
.40 Caliber, scream and gimme the loot
He can't tuck a gun, his skinny jeans skinny as Snoop
And dice high to the sky, you can die in a minute
If you lying in your lyrics cause the sky is the limit
You raps is unbelievable, you ready to lie
We ready to kill and we ready to die
Pusha T got beef with Young Money, disbelief
Didn't Biggie let you niggas know what's beef?
Who shot ya? You're nobody 'till somebody kills you
Long kiss goodnight, I'm warning what I will do
I reached my peek, I can't speak
Call Kay Slay, tell him that my will was weak
Before I let you outta town and murder New York
I'll kill hip hop myself, suicidal thoughts
