I'm capitalizing with DJ Will
Zip locks, bag scales and yay hills
'Advil users who take pills
Using pain killers to kill the pain 'cause pain kills
Some say they came in this industry just to make bills
Money don't move me, I came here to display skills
Wanna talk money, you niggas had about eight deals
Still can't pass me, my first one was a straight mill
Epidural shot, feel numbness if you don't stay still
And I look healthy, I got a medic that ain't ill
Led poisoned kids who went to school but ain't chill
Asbestos come out of the walls soon as the paint peals
Catch a juvy case, probation and go away chill
You ain't go to juvenile hall your case ain't sealed
Impersonating officers, niggas is showing face chills
Book you for working your re-up money, you ain't real
The mic turn table with sassing, who late the bass bill
Play fear, I never eat nothing that I ain't killed
Strong'shoot out sharp shooters and armed robbers
Al Pacino, primo, DeNiro, the godfather
Boardwalk empire, Luciano, a bought drama
'Castelano giving out orders from a massage parlor
Kidnapped, torture, decapitation, it's all common
Leather-face Jason and Freddy, all in my songs horror
Godzilla, King Kong, hell raiser, the bomb monster
Wearing a full metal jacket, chest and arm armor
Gun in the cup holder, soldier next to the car charger
Legal system set up to send me dearly departed martyrs
Innocent kids doing time for '
Man, I'm signing off in Japanese, Sayonara
