[Intro]
To everybody in the struggle
We gonna rise
Fame and fortune
And live the Nacirema Dream
Let’s go!

[Hook]
The Nacirema Dream, enjoy the life’s finer things
I want my lady to live like a queen
She want her man to live like a king
It’s bada bing, cha ching and bling bling
Nacirema Dream, big cars and diamond rings
I want my mother to live like a queen
She want her son to live like a king
It’s bada bing, cha ching and bling bling
Nacirema Dream

[Verse 1]
God reveal my treasure
I always knew I would build my cheddar
Pop criss like Webber, everybody who felt my pain
I want yall to feel my pleasure
When people said I wouldn’t get a deal
I never listened cuz who they told was ill I’m better
But I still had to hustle so crills I measured
Always had a way out cuz skills I endeavored
He jumpin over me to be the king, not clever
You knew this cuz life is a game of chess, not checkers
On a property, finally found the treasure in yall strivin
Stay away from the jeopardy, probably ecstasy
No poverty whether your plan is treachery
Lottery is filled from ebony to ivory
So now my mama don’t gotta worry, kids don’t gotta worry
I got more dead presidents than a cemetery

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Watching that flat screen cable
Eating life crumbs, I’m over the kitchen table
Every day I’m getting calls from another label
Remember when I used to boost more than jumper cables
Living in this Nacirema Dream, I’m able
To push the May-Back like an extra day of April
I’m nice, I rock ice just like Ice
Anyone Vanilla Ice, Ice T, just ice
Ice Cube, ice dudes, make the right moves
I’m a leader, niggas follow me just like rules
Cuz I’m the best star livin, 10 pie flippin
Next guy getting on the next dive mission
Puff the best lie, given, NY pimpin
Watch yo taillight vision, in the lengths I’m whippin
Nacirema Dream, it’s American spelled backwards
Living the American Dream is what I practice

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fish bones dry in the kitchen (Nacirema)
Beans don’t burn on the grill (Dream)
Took a whole lot of to ride in
Just to get me a record deal (Nacirema)
Man I’m way up in the big league (Dream)
Getting my turn that back (Nacirema)
As long as we rich
You and me baby
Ain’t nothing wrong with that
I remember when they used to call us the free lunch bunch
Now we sign autographs when they see us work
Hop in the airplane, the weed up up
In the way all day while you re-up chop
When we land in yo city, they feed us lunch
We touch down like 1, 2, 3 hut hut
I’m reflection of this, I learned these tactics
Put the word in a mirror, watch it reflect backwards
