I dont eat no ham
With both hands
With a toast plan
With your Broke fam
With your broke mans
And he won't ram
Ima dope man
With a dope plan
With a program
Throw grams
Through the whole land
Im nice when the show scrams
Get em hype with the flow mans
Stick a knife up your glance
Got the lights in the roach van
While you niggas liven life in the romance
You live life like a old man
Through the heights give em no chance
Told you i spent
I Was in your girl bra days in your girl shirt menece in your girl car Nice in your girl pants
Put ya to sleep like lindsy did lohan
Bars Like Rosanne'
Strong like Cohnan
You a sucker for love like a slow jam
Put my foot up your ass and have you shitten slow Jam
Niggas say they gangster but i knoe you ain't tht gangster foney
Keep it real with niggas you ain't gangster ask my lady homie
Franks Like Nathens
Getten Em Dip em in Bejamins Franklins
And i do it so big when i do for the kids im like thats so raven

Amen
Poor the Ceaser face in
Fitted hat with the 7-5 Ace in
Tryna pat down a thug no hats in the club tryna say i ckant bring my yank in
Been nice Since Pastor Basics
Straight like teeth after braces
Im supplyin had you buying had you cryinn had you dien why you lien Exaggeration
Cop from Me Congradulations
My Whip game is that amazing
How you think a clock Grip my hands stay on the whip like navagation
I got more guns then t.i
You better mind your B.i
My Stacking Go got a magic flow you a average joe like G.i
Allways had a buzz like a bee hive
Till i took off my levis
Shawty took off her knee Highs
Then She Said Mida' Mida'
NasaRema
A Cowboy like YeeHaa

In the all black trucks with the seats high
