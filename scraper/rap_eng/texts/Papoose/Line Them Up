[Verse]
My lyrics is spirits they come to haunt you
Premeditated lyricism I'm very thoughtful
Niggas put you on you front they goin' off you
Gun but your mother my brother they not remorseful
The DJ's told me to reason and they support you
Outside of that you wack horrible awful
The blood's in your lane then you do a walkthrough
Outpolled cables and bench they know you don't fool
They know my style I burn the tracks
They walk in tight ropes, niggas is clowns with all that circus rap
Back it out then I jerked the strap
'Cause man if everybody a boss where all the workers at
They heard a paps since they like frontin' man I confront them
Hit 'em with the frontin' leave 'em with a dirty back
Once got caught with a burner's scrap
Got more priars then richer in imports where my attorney at
Go to cali burn a sec that's the same shit that got Chris Rock
So I walk around with my burnie mac
Niggas sounding like nerds with all that nerdy rap
Put 'em to sleep give 'em a dirty nap
My getaway cars my everyday car
I let the ready blow that means somebody just got shot if you see that caddy go
I move around with that cali goal
Hit up a whole van full of your people
No Mario
I told my man he should stop the willin
He went to jail and played crazy
Now they got 'em in the top of salon
Every case he's now of trial
You can't go upstate and play with them pigs
That's not like your salad
They mad at me 'cause I'm stylin'
But damn, I ain't even had my gators on I was crocodiling
We caught 'em slipping out of balance
But we ain't even shot 'em we just beat 'em up
We trying to stop the violence
Your other man he just got a problem
He talked about me like a dog, ain't taking personal I was smiling
He getting gased up by the gallon
Ain't know his phone was on I bar corner him I was growling
I ain't say a word I was sallin
Next time you talk about somebody make sure your phone ain't pocket dialing
I rock a watch with large stones
Do it for the love of hip hop like Bob Jones
My rhymes memorized y'all read from your phone
Nothing but a bunch of dumb niggas with smart phones
