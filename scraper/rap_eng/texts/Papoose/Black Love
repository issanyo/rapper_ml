[Verse 1: Papoose]
I like girls with gold teeth, faithful don't cheat
Let me handcuff her to the bed like police
Too real for twitter man she so street
Check her timeline, you won't see no tweets
Ride or die chick, you don't want no beef
Good sense of humor, she funny like Monique
She a neat freak, the crib be so neat
A night freak swear to God, I don't get no sleep
Ahead cause we both getting bread, whole wheat
Disagree we gon' patch it up, slowly
Watched Kevin Hart he had me so weak
Seen Cooley High we cried for Cochise
Eating mangos in the summer so sweet
We be riding on them jet skis, Jones beach
Strong like forty kings and queens we both be
Even though it's just two of us we roll deep

[Hook: Nathaniel]
This is power, this is pride
King and Queen, so divine
If love could kill it'll be a homicide
No describing, this thing we got
Ain't nothing like black love
Ain't nothing like black love
Ain't nothing like black love
No, ain't nothing like black love
Ain't nothing like black love

[Verse 2: Papoose]
I like girls with tattoos, a bad attitude
Screaming out my name when i'm in it
(Papoose)
Cause I make her smile when she in a bad mood
Independent woman gettin' cream cash rules
I told her ex man I got some bad news
Real chicks don't get along with whack dudes
Dance like she an exotic dancer jesus
I love a woman who know how to dance mamoose
Dance with a cup in high heeled black shoes
But never spill her drink yeah she that smooth
I guess it's safe to say I picked a winner can't loose
She the queen so I proposed that big castle

[Hook: Nathaniel]
This is power, this is pride
King and Queen, so divine
If love could kill it'll be a homicide
No describing, this thing we got
Ain't nothing like black love
Ain't nothing like black love
Ain't nothing like black love
No, ain't nothing like black love
Ain't nothing like black love
