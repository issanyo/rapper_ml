I had the quarter water when i was young, stepped it up, not a juice, the 2- 5, u dumb f**k
Pull a 80 on me baby, who you think scared
I take the gun in the club, man i bring it everywhere
I load the clip, i dont play when i got that fifth
Bed-stuy up in this bitch, yeah i smell like eros
Who wanna be a hero, put a hole in you bout the size of a zero, i was over seas where the haze is legal
Get high, I'm already that, clip I'm a empty that
Thugga cated from the stuy, hit u right between the eyes
Call that gun talk, i really bust off
The home attendant wash you up
Super pick the garbage up
Loco when i bust
You maric√≥ns better duck
You dont want it in the streets
I get busy in the city, I come where you eat

Capice

I get gully bust a shot...I - I grip it
I get gully bust a shot...I - I grip it
I get gully bust a shot...bust bust a shot bust bust a shot

My gun go off...(shots fired)

I get gully bust a shot...I - I grip it
I get gully bust a shot...I - I grip it
I get gully bust a shot...bust bust a shot bust bust a shot

My gun go off...

You can call this a freestyle, i say it's a remix
My name papoose, nicest nigga on the street
Shit first it was the tech nine, then the mac 90
The starting me, but pardon me, i keep grippin em
U can call me Mr. Mackey, my pants stay baggy
Hit ya click up, make um do that aunt jackie
Chicken-noodle,moonwalk,electric slide,shoot-off
Smurf'en and whop'in, who wan get it poppin
I was young i used to rob them, now they wanna rob me
Catch me slippin, oh no no not me
Homie why you schemin,I'll leave you leanin
I'm so relentless when lettin that cannon go
No bandana but i bang like rambo
Shoot you with my right hand, hit you and ya hypeman
Homie calm down you talkin too loud
Matter a fact I'm reaching for my gun right now...(gun shot in the background)
