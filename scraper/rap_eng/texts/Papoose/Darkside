[Hook]
I'm from the dark side
Dark side, dark side, dark side, dark side, dark side
I'm from the dark side
Dark side, dark side, dark side, dark side, dark side
The lights went out, the lights went out
The lights went out, nigga the lights went out
I said the lights went, the lights went out
The lights went out, homie the lights went out

[Verse 1]
They say why New York dudes always wear Timberland's
'Cause when we stomp niggas out we like to finish 'em
Bulletproof truck don't make me laugh
'Cause you gotta get out the truck to pump your gas
They got a lot a secrets that they know we know
So when they come around us they have no ego
Catch me at the dice game I'ma throw Cee-lo
Stick up kids get no free dough
Catch you sitting in your v let the toastie go
Put a hole on both sides of your v, OVO
(Where you from?) I'm from the dark side
If one of us got drama homie we all ride
At my cousin's funeral we all cried
Papoose ain't been the same since Strong died
I just hop in the Maybach and ride
Brooklyn is mine I'm bout to take back the Stuy
Never gave nothing say I gotta payback but why
Only thing I got to do homie is stay black and die

[Hook]
I'm from the dark side
Dark side, dark side, dark side, dark side, dark side
I'm from the dark side
Dark side, dark side, dark side, dark side, dark side
The lights went out, the lights went out
The lights went out, nigga the lights went out
I said the lights went, the lights went out
The lights went out, homie the lights went out

[Verse 2]
Ask Stevie Wonder he gon tell you when I die
I'm so gifted they gon put a ribbon in the sky
Never shy to a fight, you talk a lot
You can catch this fade, barbershop
Set your crib on fire, the doors is locked
You can't open the door cause the knob is hot
I got that rubber grip on me, marvelous Glock
I be backing out on them, parking spot
More heart than Kevin, my bars is hot
Y'all rappers really comedians, Chocolate Drop
Clip loaded to the top I bet you see
It's better when it's fully loaded like an SUV
Somebody ever made you real mad?
And you totally spazzed out on they ass
Now they sorry tryna apologize
Deep down inside everybody got a dark side

[Hook]
I'm from the dark side
Dark side, dark side, dark side, dark side, dark side
I'm from the dark side
Dark side, dark side, dark side, dark side, dark side
The lights went out, the lights went out
The lights went out, nigga the lights went out
I said the lights went, the lights went out
The lights went out, homie the lights went out
