I wanna have a toast they said I'd never make it here
But now you hear my music everywhere
Yeah... we about to be millionaires
So let's all have a toast cheers
To all the ladies everywhere
You and your man have been together for years
Love is a battlefield, but you still there
So this toast is for y'all cheers
I don't care if y'all drinking wine or beer
Everybody put your cups in the air
Celebrate life if you still here
And let's all have a toast cheers
You give me money and fame
And all I got to do is entertain
My beautiful rap game I love you
You the watch on my wrist the ice on my ring
Bling bling look at the diamonds on my chain
My ice out jewelry I love you
You my new desert eagle my Glock when I aim
All you hear is shoot em' up bang bang
My fully loaded pistol I love you
Work like a slavery, ear like a king
We do it for the love of material things
I love brand new cars, I love real money
I love expensive clothes, I love getting gully
I love fitted caps, I love new sneakers
The latest cell phone with all the new features
I love kosher food, I love being healthy
I love a big ass house, I love being wealthy
I love purple haze, I love chocolate thai
I love to get high
You gave birth to me, took my virginity the same
You between every female's legs, I love pussy simple and plain
I love doing shows, hearing fans when they clap
And I love you back
I love having fun, I love a good party
Bar tender crystal for everybody
Y'all made a change in hip-hop
Don't understand why y'all had to get shot
Damn I love Biggie and Pac
Big Pun, Freeky Tah, and all of the rest
Who sacrificed life for the love of success
If's a four letter word with mass appeal
It's like we at war, love is a battlefield
For the love of money we become gangstas and thugs
Just because no one wants to spread love
In relationships, when an individual hurting
They will harm themselves for the love of another person
Love is a battlefield, I'mma give you some help
Before you love anybody, you gotta love yourself
Work like a slave, eat like a king
We do it for the love of material things
