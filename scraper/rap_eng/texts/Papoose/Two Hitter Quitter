[Hook: Papoose]
We in the club two stepping, one two
I hit them with a two piece, one two
(clears throat) My mic on? one two
Alright, I'm your two hitter quitter
We in the club two stepping, one two
I hit them with a two piece, one two
One...Two...One two three

[Verse 1: Papoose]
None of ya'll don't want with me
I get you knocked off for a couple of Gees
Man I had to switch my flow
To ask ya'll out like tick tack toe
The homie Pap let the click clack go
Ratta tat tat, ain't that so
I'm way nicer than all ya'll
Cue my man he going to put me on world star
Project girls they the best player
They be going up and down like an elevator
Girls from the suburbs got the boom box
Had you looking for them lost in the Boondocks
Girls from the side-blocks where they breath on it
She got that foreclosure pussy put a lean on it
She gonna give it to the next man if he want it
If you like then you should of put a ring on it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Papoose]
All of ya'll know my style
I cop a new outfit and throw that down
The P R hold me down
That little shit sound like a forty cow
Hit up you whip with a strap boy
Your car totaled like those girls from bad boy
Nah I don't go clubbing
But when I do go man I go thugging, (Thug or!)
And all Latin all lat
Shorty said she wanna scratch my back
I see you've got your hair well done
Before you scratch me you gotta get your nails done
This nigga running his mouth
Two piece wake him up drag him out
They say they get it so crunk
I make it hotter than the tip of your blunt

[Hook]
