[Intro]
The Law Library saga now continues
The Nacirema Dream version
As promised, yuh

[Hook: Papoose]
You used to get a year for a gun, they increasing the math
Nowadays you gon get 3 and a half
A predicate 5 or 7, word is bond
Welcome to Law Library, fire arms
Take these bars and put em in your conversary
The veils is heavy, lawyer taking every penny
Pay attention, you could leave your jail cell empty
I'd like to welcome you to my law library
Take these bars and play em in the beacon son
I am you, you are me, we are one
Law Library, a place where you need to come
Cuz to get freedom, you can't be free and dumb

[Verse: Papoose]
We educated, so the cops is pissed
Now they got a new plan, stop and frisk
Interesting, they caught my attention
Cuz this a violation of the 4th amendment
Which speaks on seach and seizure
So all officers should research procedure
You gotta learn this, its the right of the people to be secure
Against all the reasonable searches
They dont understand the amendment
They stop and frisk, its one of the many exceptions
They altered it, changed the definition
So now its a perfect fit for all the bullshittin'
Sounds like fiction but to justify it in court
The cops gotta have reasonable suspicion
If they sont, this where I need you to listen
To search you they gotta ask for permission
I can't determine how that go
But if I was you I would say hell no
Reason to stop, fact determined by a cop
Informant or having presence on a high block
Reason to frisk, suspect the law, you breakin it
All suspicion that a man is armed and dangerous
Even though they making these horrible laws
They cannot search you without probable cause
Gun cases get dictated by the laws
Your defense is to prove Is not yours
The presence in any room, dwelling structure or vehicle
Any grounds of any machine gun is presumptive evidence now
Of its unlawful possession by all persons
Occupying a place, such machine gun was found
If you in the vicinity of a gun you taking chances
Unless under the following circumstances
A if such weapon found was where?
Upon a person of one of the occupants there
B if the weapon found in the car was either being operated for hire
By a licensed driver
C is plain
If one of the occupants has a valid license to have and carry concealed, the same
Whats the next chapter that I should reveal?
Article 4-50 of appeals
