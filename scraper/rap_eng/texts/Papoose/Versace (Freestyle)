Versace, Versace, You fake and you phony, you corny man honestly
The first one to wear it was Biggie
You ain’t from the borough, this mockery (Brooklyn)
Run up on you niggas with triggers and killers like this is a robbery
5th on the side of me, biting’s forbidden, You tripping and we want a written apology
Gianni Versace was murdered in front of his house in Miami
Allegedly Andrew Cunanan murdered him in front of his property
You rappers be talking bout Illuminati, don’t know the philosophy
The gods predicted this back in the day, see we had the prophecy

Bringing that rapping to people who really controlling, they stay in a whole 'nother colony
Got rid of money, it’s funny that every transaction that happen is done electronically
They throw us in jail, won’t give us a bail, say we the minority
But we take up most of the population, I feel we the majority
See you would acknowledge Versace but you won’t acknowledge the poverty
Simple and plain, these niggas is lame, They tricking yo brain, it’s all tricknology
These labels is giving you 360 deals cuz you the commodity
Rich getting richer, the poor getting poorer, And that’s just the fuckin way of the economy
Nice hitting me, never, you got a way better chance hitting the lottery
Grew up with gorillas, you grew up on Twitter, don’t care if you follow me
Bustin you open, I’m toting and hoping that none of your blood don’t drip on my wallabies
Waving a tech, I’m taking respect, like Raekwon the Chef, I speak criminology

Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Speaking the talk, I’m the king of New York, you a cheap carbon copy
2014 the queen returns, you bitches is botties
I’m gonna give Remy Martin a baby and no one can stop me!
