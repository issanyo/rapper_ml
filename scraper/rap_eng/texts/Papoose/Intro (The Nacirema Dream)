[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]
I still have a dream
A dream deeply rooted in the American Dream

[President Barack Obama]
Now the bedrock of our economic success
Is the American Dream
It’s a dream shared in big cities and small towns
Across races, regions and religions
That, if you work hard
You can support a family

[Voice 1]
Check out how the American Dream evolved

[Voice 2]
It’s the American Dream, n*gga
Well ain’t it?

[Skit]
Papoose:  Peace y’all!
Crowed:  Peace!
Papoose:  We came here today
To talk about the American Dream
People from all different corners of this planet
Come to this country
In search of that American Dream
Hard working citizens go to work every day
From nine to five, make minimum wage
In search of that American Dream
Hustlers hustle in the streets every day
In search of that American Dream
Stick up kids rob armored trucks
And run up in banks
In search of that American Dream
People become incarcerated
Never to return, for life
In search of that American Dream
What you’re about to witness
Is the story about my journey
In search of that American Dream
A lot of people think backwards
So I call it the Nacirema Dream

Angry Voice:  Get your hand out my pocket!
Get your hand out my pocket, n*gga!
Papoose:  Get your hand out my pocket!?
Crowd: Get ‘im! Get ‘im! Get ‘im! Yea! Grab ‘im!
Papoose: Naw, it ain’t goin’ down like that
We about to re-write history
You die!
