They been killing us since back in the day like it's a sport
They would hang us and pose for pics next to the corpse
Outrage, so they started to conceal
But their murders got exposed again with Emit Til
Closed casket, his mother refused one
Said she want the whole world to see how they did her son
Started keeping police brutality unseen
Till the 90's when we got the footage of Rodney King
2016 we got camera phones
Murders of Sterling, Philando and Grant were shown
They was trained to kill Black folks and that's a fact
When they go to the shooting range the silhouette is black
There wasn't only one Harriet Tubman
Do your homework it was actually hundreds
They erased what really happened back then
They don't want us to know that we can fight back and win

Trump said we gotta make America great again
Looks like he trying to make America hate again
That's why I took Black Love to the top
Before me there was no love in Hip Hop
Food supplies, we shopping in their stores
Medical, we go to their hospitals not yours
Military supplies we follow their gun laws
As an army we carry too many flaws
On that note I wouldn't advocate war
Advocate unity so we can become strong
Hating females because they got a fake ass
Men getting surgery they got fake abs
I don't watch the first 48
That shit wack
They try to make Black folks look like rats
Show us killing each other on the TV screen
Let's build a kingdom so we can look like Kings
