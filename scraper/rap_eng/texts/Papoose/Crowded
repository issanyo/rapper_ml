[Intro: Papoose]
Jeannie Ortega, Papoose
Lemme show you how it’s supposed to be done, uh

[Verse 1: Jeannie Ortega]
Don't get me started, it's getting kinda crowded in here
Back up off me, I'm feeling like I'm suffocated
Now here's my problem, I'm not gonna be your chick on the side
Forget about it, you know damn well it wouldn't be right

[Pre-Hook: Jeannie Ortega]
I don’t know what you been thinking 'bout me
Did you think this was gonna be that easy?
Hell no, you must be going crazy

[Hook: Jeannie Ortega]
Why don't you get outta my life?
Get outta my sight
Get off of my back
Why don't you get back to your world?
Go back to your girl
I think you owe her
I know what's goin' on
I won't be second to none (no)
Back up, 'cause you're crowding my space
You need to get out of my face

[Verse 2: Jeannie Ortega]
Let’s be honest I’m not the type of chick you can use
And if you want it, if you want it you’ll have to choose
Oh, I’ve been through this, been cheated on, I know how it feels
How would I know that? You couldn't do the same to me

[Pre-Hook: Jeannie Ortega]
I don’t know what you been thinking 'bout me
Did you think this was gonna be that easy?
Hell no, you must be going crazy

[Hook: Jeannie Ortega]
Why don't you get outta my life?
Get outta my sight
Get off of my back
Why don't you get back to your world?
Go back to your girl
I think you owe her (I think you owe her)
I know what's goin' on
I won't be second to none (oh no)
Back up, 'cause you're crowding my space
You need to get out of my face

[Verse 3: Papoose]
Bk, Bk Uh
They say you can't have your cake and eat it too
Tell me, what's the meaning?
What's the sense of me having cake if I can't eat it?
Cheaters never win, my friend, you're like creeping
But hate when your girl starts cheating
Imagine if you came home to your wife, opened your door and locked it
Then you found R. Kelly hiding in your closet
I knew you would start cheating before you even stopped it
I'm like when you double your money; I'm a profit
Albert Einstein was smart, but I'm some wiser
I'm a ladies man, your man is a womanizer
You gotta fight for love, can you make a fist?
Since your name is Jeannie, can I make a wish?
No minor setbacks, every move major
Grown folk behavior, just do me one favor
He put you on the side, let me be your savior
Crowded, Papoose, Jeannie Ortega

[Hook: Jeannie Ortega]
Why don't you get outta my life?
Get outta my sight
Get off of my back
Why don't you get back to your world?
Go back to your girl
I think you owe her (I think you owe her)
I know what's goin' on
I won't be second to none (oh no)
Back up, 'cause you're crowding my space
You need to get out of my face
