I need a girl to take the clothes out the cleaner
The food out the freezer
Lay some off me when I cop new snickers
A name like Keisha, Tasa or Lisa
Or maybe Tanisha a real hood diva
I say you look good, she say looks can deceive you
You got a small mouth I can tell you a screamer
Wash the car for me when I park by the meter
Roll up my refull oh ye she's a keeper
Love when I come see her but hate when I leave her
So she stash my car keys behind the speaker
And she go to bed with a book she a reader
Inteligent I call her baby girl like Aliyah
Think for me when I'm not thinking she a thinker
Pick up all the shells if I clap my anina
Have you seen her I'm tryin' to find my wife
You make me high, I'm high on life

[Hook]
Holiday, it's your day every way
Celebrate, come on and celebrate
Everytime, girl everytime I see you take me
High

When she see me she hug me and make the scenery lovely
We argue she hate it but she won't leave me she love me
She get heated and cuss me let me eat when I'm hungry
Then she please me and lust me she gon' tease me she fuck me
They be keeping her from me but she sneaky she hug me
She wrote me a dirty text she said she need me she want em
Now you haters make me sick I'm gonna need me some buckles
I don't need her she ugly she completly disgust me
Never lie to my lady she would easily bust me
She know me like a book she can read me just trust me
And she cook like a chef she be feeding my tummy
I love that ass like cash come and bring me my money
When I feel all alone I just think of my honey
She ccupying my mind she be keeping me company
We see the haters we laugh cause we thinking it's funny
She been with me through the storm so she with me when it's sunny
Holiday love

[Hook:]
Holiday, it's your day every way
Celebrate, come on and celebrate
Everytime, girl everytime I see you take me
High
