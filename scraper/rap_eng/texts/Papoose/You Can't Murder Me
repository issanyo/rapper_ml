(feat. Murder Mook)

I want everybody to pay real close attention, don't get it twisted
No man can murder Papoose, and I'ma show it
I trade places with dead poets

I never disrespect the dead, I'm keepin' them livin'
'cuz when all of them died, they took apart of me wit them
You can't murder me, 6 millions way to die
You can't murder me, but I ain't afraid know why

How you gon' kill Papoose, he already took a fall
They shot the side of his car, my name Biggie Smalls
Listen duke, throwin' rappers off a roof
Bullet proof, disappearin' with my troops
In a tinted out lex coup, read my lips I'll finish you
Metaphorically I'm too lyrical

How you gon' kill Papoose, he already took shots
They killed him in Las Vegas, my name 2Pac
I ain't a killah but don't trip
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin rich

How you gon' kill Papoose, he already faced his death
A tricknologist killed him, my name Malcolm X
A eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
Honor before money, loyal till you salute
Take mines I'll take yours, revenge is a must
We ain't land on the hood, the hood landed on us

I never disrespect the dead, I'm keepin' them livin'
'cuz when all of them died, they took apart of me with them
You can't murder me, 6 millions way to die
You can't murder me, but I ain't afraid know why

How you gon' kill Papoose, he already dead you dumb
He went back to the essence, my name Big Pun
I grip the fifth, and I'm slippin' the clip
And I'm hittin' the strip, wit the triggas I'm clickin' it
I'm splittin' yo wig wit it

How you gon' kill Papoose, the angels took him in the sky
He lost his life in queens, my name Freaky Ty
The life styles of the thugs n' the gangstas
Some die like a g, some die wankstas

How you gon' kill Papoose, he already seen a casket
He passed away, my name 'Ol Dirty Bastard
Shame on a nigga who try to get a name on a nigga
Buck wild wit the trigga

And how you gon' try to Kill Papoose, he died before he excel
Lost his life tragically, my name Big L
Listen spark up the backwood, n' pass the crys
Make it quick money grip, or yo ass is hiss

I never disrespect the dead, I'm keepin' them livin'
'cuz when all of them died, they took apart of me wit them
You can't murder me, 6 millions way to die
You can't murder me, but I ain't afraid know why

How you gon' kill Papoose, he already passed away
He died in queens, my name Jam Master Jay
Peter piper picked pebbles, but Pap rapped rhymes
Y'all cock blockin', I cock nines

Tell me how you gon' kill Papoose, he already dead you stupid
He died as a black panther, my name Huey Newton
We got the constitution the rights to bare arms
Ya'll wear clothes, we wear chrons

Tell me how you gon' kill Papoose, he died with a lot of skills
He lost his life in Brooklyn, my name Half a Mil
Some nigga's blood, is some nigga's crip
Some nigga's bid, is some nigga's snitch

How you gon' kill Papoose, he already dead so stop
He died back in the days, my name Scott La Rock
I'm criminal minded, you been lyin'
Talkin' bout your jewels you ice less

How you gon' kill Papoose, he already dead my friend
He lost his life tragically, my name Soldier Slim
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Bloods keep bangin' for me, crips keep loc'in for me

One in a million like a lea ray charge
Open ya eyes, try to see me you chasin' waterfalls like Left Eye
You can't kill Papoose, when you spit the same shit
You switch n slang quick, I'm Rick James bitch

I never disrespect the dead, I'm keepin' them livin'
'cuz when all of them died, they took apart of me with them
You can't murder me, 6 millions way to die
You can't murder me, but I ain't afraid know why

You can't murder me
