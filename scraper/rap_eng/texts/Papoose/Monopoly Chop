(Intro)

To everybody in the struggle
If somebody ever told you, you couldn't do something
And you still made it happen
Congratulations
So clap for the independent women
So clap for my homies straight thuggin
Clap for the real MC's buzzin
We the leaders of the new school
Uh...

(Verse 1)
Mama's in the kitchen cookin' that rice
Father's outside shootin' em dice
Brother's in jail raising hell
Sister's on the corner sellin' fruit cocktails
Family alcoholic's still sippin' his booze
That's why i'm rappin' over rhythm and blues
To all you rich black folks with your glissining jewels
Entrepeneurs all you millionaire dudes
Before you catch another case limit your moves
Johnny Cochran got a brain tumor i deliver the news
What if mother nature aborted the sky
When we shoot our fireworks on the fourth of July
We can't afford the life so abortion rised
Can't afford the truth so we told a lie
Can't afford a funeral cause the cost is high
GOD DAMN we can't even afford to die

(Chorus)
But if you buying a house i'll be your landlord
I'll finance you a car that's if you can afford
I own the jails, the banks and all the property's
Here's a million come on big shot
Lets play Monopoly

(Verse 2)
Cause when the rappers start grindin'
It's a shame my outta towna gotta sign em
But when his album drop and he go diamond
Everybody was beside em
Every real artist need a real label to sign em

Jus like every good man need a good woman behind them
It ain't about havin' the baddest chick on the streets
I respect the dude Nas cause he married Kelis
But still if you ain't ready just wanna be my Beyonce
Then we can do it like Jay-Z & Beyonce
Pardon my language if you a real bitch
Then we can do it like Jada & Will Smith
Coincedence where we comin' to spend it at
We in the same place that we first got rich at
They only gon' give us what they know they can get back
So when you get money don't you ever forget that

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
He got a DVD flow
They need to get my man Smack his own TV show
The voice of the jail, voice of the streets
Kay Slay's social plays seven days a week
We pull guns on eachother always still people's
If you strapped then i'm not strapped we still equal
They say don't carry guns cause guns real lethal
But guns don't kill people, people kill people
My cousin got into time he said it ain't nothing
Told me i can do the time standing on my head cousin
Yo Paps stay focused you out here bustin'
Time i come home you gon' be somethin'
Wish i can do half of this time for him
We goin' in thuggin' He do it here i do it here
They running through cover but still
It's all about having money and properties (True)
They rather see us doing drugs then robberies (True)
We gotta flip that into the economy (You)
So my philosophy is the way of the world
Lets play monopoly

Gotta Monopolize & Strategize
So we can get this money
Get filthy rich
Thugication, Streetsweepers
C'mon man
East Coast pop a bottle with y'all
West Coast pop a bottle with y'all
Down South pop a bottle with y'all
Count your blessings you ain't promised them all
