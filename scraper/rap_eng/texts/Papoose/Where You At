Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?
Baby, where you at? Baby, where you at?
Baby, where you at? Baby, where you at?
Every word to touch you down; it's playin' in my head
Like a Scarface crime scene, ain't no bringin' it back
Those tears didn't mean much then, but now I know
That you said you don't feel it; the wind starts to get cold
(Only) she's a woman; like a car, I replace it
(Mostly) I wonder if she saw this bullet comin' like this
(Only) words that I can hear in my ear
It's the gesture, you gon' see this soon as you plannin' in the field

[Chorus]
(Baby, where you at?) Ain't no sittin' on my pillow case no more
(Baby, where you at?) I just recognize I'm livin' life alone
(Baby, where you at?) I just, I just wish you call me; damn, this phone
(Baby, where you at?) That's if I have four weeks
My whole life just flashed before me

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, how foolish could I be?

Wild as can be
(Never) never fear bein' humble (humble)
Got in and out to face my fear
May never have a choice again
To be honest with that one that was loyal to me
God really has his ways of talking you off that stage
(Only) she's a woman; like a car, I replace it
(Mostly) I wonder if she saw this bullet comin' like this
(Only) words that I can hear in my ear
It's the gesture - you gon' see this soon as you plannin' in the field

[Chorus]
They say you never know what you have until you lose it
You promise your girl somethin', you better do it
You can't tell a women you love her, are you stupid?
Words don't express your love; you gotta prove it
Back then our relationship was the truest
Romance, slow dance to Joe music
As the time went on, I became foolish
Now you're gone, everything ruined
But, girl, this is Papoose
I'm on your favorite track
I know your friend's in your ear, but, baby, come back
And I never let you down, so later for that
I told you I was gon' make it; I'm the savior of rap
And I work hard; you don't gotta cater for Pap
I tie my own doo rag, lay back and relax
You don't even gotta accept my apology
But I'm man enough to admit it; acknowledge me

Oh! Oh! Baby! If any one event, it was just like me
Oh! Oh! Babe! Treat her like this wasn't last week
Won't you call, babe? (Won't you call?) You know the song, babe
Girl, you know the song; are you hearing me?
Damn, I regret running all overseas!

[Chorus]
