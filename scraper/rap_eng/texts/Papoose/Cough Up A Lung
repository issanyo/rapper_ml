I'm with the drama king
Kilo chains, bracelets and diamond rings
Lamborghini, Ranges, drop top, it's not a thing
Niggas wear the title of lyricists but we try to sing
We can tell your video corny by the behind the scenes
Menace to society, belly strapped kind of thing
Swimming in a bloodbath, repercussions that drama bring
Reenactment of Cain murder soon as I cock the thing
The only thing that came out was blood when he was trying to scream
Mayweather offence, check hook you for tryna swing
The Mike Tyson punch that knocked Trevor right out the ring
Shells on your top just like the legends from harlots Queens
Wrap you up like tin foil over some pile of greens
Doors to success and victory, rock solid dreams
Locked in my mind like Toogy Williams inside the bing
The 50 K carrier, bullets the size of llama beans
Finger at your f**k boy, fake, frivolous coward team
Tree sweepers, all black sky, pages of green beepers
Butchered out addressed, this beef swinging a meat cleaver
J wearing A max sneakers ahead, who keeps sneakers
Ted DiBiase, I put your man in a deep sleeper
Doing 90 over the speed limit in clean beamers
Stay true for radar gun ringing these lead speeders
'complete reader, sick with it, 1067 degree fever
Took the city back from these lame niggas, the retriever
Telephone thugs get beat down with the receiver
Niggas screaming they not pussy, I'm screaming me neither
Back handing rappers like Ike did when he beat Tina
Dedicated lyricist, accurate as an SK
The UPS, FedEx, best delivery the next day
Unspoken truth, who verbalize it the best way
You live in the LA like Long Island express way
