[Intro]
Ayo Slay we gon' ride till the sun burn out
The saga continues
Thug-A, Thug-A, Thug-A-Cation
Street sweepers entertain me
The saga continues
Thug-A-Cation
The saga continues
Papoose
The saga continues
They can never stop me
The saga continues

[Verse]
While y'all was in Miami for memorial day
I was cleaning my gun making sure the 40 OK
They say the making movies, you call me OK
We seen a movie, but you ain't let the audio play
Nigga say stick up, kids don't live long
But I'm still living I proved them pricks wrong
Soon as I put the boy on the block that shit gone
Come on man I move more boy than Big Sean
When I be on fire they tell me they don't want
Lay up in the sun and leave me in the storm
Do their little shows don't want me to perform
Roof roof feels good to be the underdog
I grew up in the same neighborhood as Chris Rock
Bane bridge, I live right around the corner from dots
But it was nothing like everybody hates Chris
Just a gangster hood where everybody hate a snitch
Cop the new form deposits out of top deeds
Then I head to jewelry store get my jewelry clean
Cop a 50 half of Ralphie's, a bro y'all breeze
Papoose diner fish home fries and cheese
I ain't no Al Pacino but I move a few joints
Sell a bird for my man just to make a few points
Your man oath then he gonna pay me
My gun clap like a thunder no OKC
Niggas talking all this New York shit
Chase you back into the mountains toss you off cliffs
Think you Tony Montana, who want this
I get rid of Tony like the New York Knicks
Jeremy Lin sip penny and gin
If we was once enemies we could never be friends
Bet you ain't never disrespect me again
Skinny niggas with felonies call me felony slim
