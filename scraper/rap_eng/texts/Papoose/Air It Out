Yeah!
Ya'll already know what this is
Got the voice of Brooklyn, I know ya'll niggas here my footsteps out there
A.K.A. the son of song
A.K.A. the 1 point jive
Ya'll know what I'mma tell ya'll now right?
A.K.A., y'all know what I'mma say already? Papoose, Pap-poose

Cock the thing, air it out [x4]

Now where da hammer let's grip it
Cock it back let's spit it
Weed spot let's stick it
Where da work let's flip it

Cock the thing, now air it out [x2]

I was sittin' on da stoop, sittin' on da stoop
Sittin' on da stoop with the ruger on my side
Now I'm ridin' in a coup, ridin' in a coup
Ridin' in a coup with the ruger on my side

Cock the thing, now air it out [x4]

I was on Fulton street downtown Brooklyn
Iced out so this nigga keep lookin'
He ain't know Pap had the scat on him
Cock the thing back then I step to him

Cock the thing, now air it out [x4]

I was on "Touch It Remix", man I did my thing
But I came up man shit done change
Now the one point jive is my name
STOP! Show them how that gun bang

Cock the thing, now air it out [x4]

I was on 47th at a Diamond District THEN
David Blane got ma wrist glistenin'
Rappers say they wanna get it in with him
When they see him they don't say shit to him

Cock the thing, now air it out [x4]

Kay Slay Thug-A-Cation and P.A.P
Carry our guns through the industry
Talk tough then we tell you R.I.P
So all y'all punk rappers stop comin' at me

Cock the thing, now air it out [x3]
Cock the thing, cock-suckas!
