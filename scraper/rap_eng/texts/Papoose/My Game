[Hook: Flexplicity]
I know my names
About to reign
The sun won't shine
Unless I'm paid
You know my name

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9]
Uh, that clip'll hit your product
Before your product lift you out your prada's
I'm addicted to them dollers
Heading to the top, getting in the way of that
That'll get you to the bottom, get you to the bottom
He addicted to the violence, the penmanship inside him
Is the hottest, he be styling, he's psychotic
Undoubtly about it write it, if he spot it, G he got it
He should probably be on diet, Uh
Kamakazie pilot, slaughterhouse are bound to defy alliance
When it come to beefing yall should probably diet
Because we ain't stopping till we got a homicidal triumph
By the way we bought 'em, had em all, buy it
Kinda car buyers, gotta be the landboat ferrari or phantom flying on by ya'
I am fire, dire, expire, admire, liars, deniars, and I am
On some old hood shit, full clip, go for no bullshit
Poconos jewelry, smelling like a brewery
Selling like a new release, ooh we, feeling like a new Vee'

[Hook: Flexplicity]
I know my names
About to reign
The sun won't shine
Unless I'm paid
I know my names
About to reign
The sun won't shine
Unless I'm paid
You know my name

[Verse 2: Papoose]
Smith and Wesson, lift the dresser
Grip a [?], we're vendetta
Rip your sweater, quick, in shredder
This dilemma sends a tremor
Spit it clever with whatever
Clip your feathers, Cinderella
Hit the head of different fellas
Quick [?] professor
Large revolver, squadron presser
Sayonara, charred the cheddar
Art as hard as large professor
Metaphors that'll finesse ya
R&R that call forever
Walk the corridor of terror
Told to God I'd start a lecture

[Verse 3: Flexplicity]
All my niggas are ruthless
We do this, moving this movement
And music ---

[Verse 3: Professor Green]

See haters, Greens a name they mention
But I'm a cheapskate I don't even pay attention
Cos talk is cheap and time you can't put a price on it
Only bet what you can afford to lose
Do you really wanna put your life on it?
Looking at my bucket list, ticking like my watch is
I said my watch, I meant my watches
I ain't got a Rolex, I got Rolex's
Time so precious, pay mine to no hecklers
Heckle me, heck lord, tech 4 or
Anything weaponry I can get my hands on to end war
Careful what you rep for, me I'm my own man
Shit so, schizo, we are my own gang
Weed addict, now i'm ready, get another roll
Thanks to my flow, I'll never have to sell another O
Its Pro, P-R-O, you know the professor, go-getter
For anything less than ten grand I won't get up out of bed
