[Intro: Papoose]
Sound like it's gonna be a hot summer, cool off
I told you I got 'em..... Papoose, Pa-poose

[Hook: Papoose]
I'm gettin' money everyday cause I'm like that
I wear my jewelry anyway cause I'm like that
I drive a Cadillac truck cause I'm like that
I don't give a flyin' fuck cause I'm like that
That dude ain't like that, he ain't like that
They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that
That nigga ain't like that, he ain't like that
They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that
THEY AIGHT!!!!!

[Verse 1: Papoose]
I told y'all I'm like that
They said I fell off, tell 'em I'm right back!
I drove in the industry in the white 'lac
Back then, only two niggas was nice scrap
If you wasn't screamin' "SQUAD UP!" just like Stack
You was screamin' "THUGA THUGA THUGA!" just like Pap
In your ear like a Q-Tip where Phife at?!
Though you said you was a rider man where's your bike at?!
I like a bucket naked bitch with nice tatts
Earrings with the hoops in 'em just like Shaq
'Bout to put Knicks in the strip where Spike at?!
Do your homework shots fly when I strike back
I spit fire like Satan when I rap
Got the Jesus piece if you wonder where Christ at?
I hustle like the snowman, your girl your loan fam
She show the ta ta's I ain't talkin' about Hulk man

[Hook: Papoose & Jadakiss]
I'm gettin' money everyday cause I'm like that (Yeah!)
I wear my jewelry anyway cause I'm like that (Ha Ha Ha!)
I drive a Cadillac truck cause I'm like that (Uh!)
I don't give a flyin' fuck cause I'm like that (FUCK 'EM!)
That dude ain't like that (Nah!) he ain't like that (Uh oh!)
They ain't like that (Nope!) them niggas ain't like that (EH HEH!!!)
That nigga ain't like that (Nah!) he ain't like that (Uh oh!)
They ain't like that (Nah!) them niggas ain't like that (Uh!)
THEY AIGHT!!!!!

[Verse 2: Jadakiss & Styles P]
Yeah! Yo! Uh! I'm like that!
My transporter always get that white back
(Make sure the couch right to catch that flight back)
Addicted to the same medication as Mike Jack!
(Old school high top Air's with the Nike strap)
We don't want your bitch dog come get your wife back
(Money in the safe keep the dough where the rice at)
Who advised you?! Where you get your advice at?!
(Never get the eat the whole pie you gotta slice that)
Lil' paper you spit nigga we spit twice that
(For you it's like a mill but for us it's a life snack)
Drive by, shoot shit up in the white Acc'
(Niggas used to steal on you, you wouldn't fight back)
But bitch actin' tough you should be where the dykes at
(Like Cushi in Casino put your hand where the vice at)
You eyeballs will pop out, and you won't like that
('Cause you ain't like that!)

[Hook: Papoose & 2 Chainz]
I'm gettin' money everyday cause I'm like that
I wear my jewelry anyway cause I'm like that
I drive a Cadillac truck cause I'm like that
I don't give a flyin' fuck cause I'm like that
That dude ain't like that, he ain't like that
They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that
That nigga ain't like that, he ain't like that
They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that (UH! 2 CHAINZ!!!!!)
THEY AIGHT!!!!!

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Yeah! Rise to form you ride in the Delorean
Back To The Future so you niggas better Oregon
Dealt when I'm approachin', hey mayne good
But I got enough rounds to hit you and your closest friend
You know I roll 'em in, throw 'em in, kick 'em out
Laid back, every room got a fuckin' different couch
Everyday I'm smokin' on a different ounce (YEAH!)
Every mill I make I buy a fuckin' different house
And they AIGHT!
Got three girlfriends and they all dykes
We all high, S.O.S. Swag on site
Yeah It's like that, did my thang
Brought that white back
Get that cheese, don't get scared of that mice trap
RAAAHHHH!! A lot of rounds kill 'em with the muffled sound
Still an underdog puttin' niggas underground

[Hook: Papoose]
I'm gettin' money everyday cause I'm like that
I wear my jewelry anyway cause I'm like that
I drive a Cadillac truck cause I'm like that
I don't give a flyin' fuck cause I'm like that
That dude ain't like that, he ain't like that
They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that
That nigga ain't like that, he ain't like that
They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that
THEY AIGHT!!!!!
