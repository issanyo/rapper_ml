[Intro]
When I’m in Miami
When I’m in Atlanta
The radio sound like I’m in Miami
When I’m in New York
The radio sound like I’m in Miami
So you feel like
Now, my response to that is
Miami currently, Atlanta currently
Is making better music musically than New York
Let me explain something to you
Them dudes is in power because yall putting them in power
[Verse 1: Papoose]
I’ve been fighting in spikes
Came off tour, my mic was on
Me and Ebro been having this dialogue
Even though they play a major part in each way
We can’t blame it all on the DJ
Because when New York slows down
I play the side like a G
Waited my turn but learned it down to the T
Other New York artists change they bop to a bounce
Started snappin they fingers like they was from the south
Out of towners come in town, they just tag along
Apart of the entourage, playing chaperone
A bunch of escorts, got yo mains with you
Niggas do anything for a Instagram picture
But it’s bigger than them and us
I warned yall on charade, the hip-hop tops was tryna finish us
Play some boom back, take the melodies off
It’s the concrete jungle, we can never be soft

[Interlude]
We should not be playing 2 Chainz, we should not be playing Ross all the time
We should not be playing Drake, we should not be playing Drake, we should not be playing Lil Wayne
I ain’t sayin that
I’m sayin we shouldn’t be following Soo
We should be dictatin something
We should be dictatin for them to play some shit
‘Cause they dictatin what we play
Out here I sit back and I hear the radio, they like oh this is hot in Atlanta
New joint, hot, I never heard it before
This is crazy in Atlanta, boom!
I do hate that phrase
And I’m like yo, this ain’t Atlanta
This ain’t Atlanta
[Verse 2: N.O.R.E]
Yea, four gold albums, one platinum plaque, still shining
I get my record hot, they tried to tell me keep grinding
Live in Miami, how I’m pposed to get some spins there?
The first thing they say is New York spinning it there
We don’t support our own, records ain’t hot enough
Towards the artists with the budgets, guess they got the hottest stuff
We pull the support, independent artists
We proud of our city and stop playing this garbage
When we first came out this heavy wasn’t relevant
Puff was killin the agenda, walk towards gold was evident
I ain’t trying to live off my past accolades
But nowadays music gets looked over
Every new nigga’s hear their new song with me already
But my love in the city dead, obituary
Fuck it, it’s the support, good music
I ain’t talkin Kanye’ing them, I’m talkin Kay Slay’ing em
Bust Rhymes, NORE and Ghost, Cam, Rae and em

[Interlude]
When we down there, them niggas don’t give a fuck about New York
If you ain’t knowin one of they joints they ain’t supportin it
You ain’t getting no New York nigga out here for dolo and his shit poppin
Look, if there’s good music being made it’s gon get a look, right?
That’s how your music gets on, that’s how A$AP is poppin right now
You know, but at the same time if there’s shitty music being made or it’s sounding basic or regional
And it’s not poppin, streets not poppin

[Verse 1: Papoose]
Look at the last few years, it’s count
Most up north artists who made it had to sign to a artist from the south
That makes me scratch my head
Why the legends from up north left all the up and coming for dead?
Why is it that Eminem had to sign 50?
When everybody knew he had the town in his frenzy
Ross had to come up north for Meek Millie
Wayne signed Cory, Jae Millz and Iggy
When Jay-Z came up he piggy backed Biggie
Why he ain’t never pushed no artist from his city?
Ain’t hatin, every man gotta put in they own work
I’m just pointin out the facts, been doing my homework
They don’t judge a artist by his excellence
Everybody only know one word, relevant
Expand your vocabulary when the real artist shit drop
‘Cause the word relevant is really killin hip-hop
This goes out to every city, big or small
Support up north like we support yall
