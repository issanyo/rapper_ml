INTRO BY PAPOOSE:
You wanna go to war? lets get it then
If war bring peace im wit it then
I don't start beef, I finish it
Ghetto soldiers, we militent

AKON:
I dont like to fuss or fight
Just tryin to live life right
But dont take my kindness for weekness 'cause i will take your life
At first i will walk away, unless you push me to play
But thats somthin I know you'll regret, so please dont forget:

Im a ghetto soldier,desperado oooo
Im a ghetto soldier,good man sing ooooo
Im a ghetto soldier,how white sing ooooo
Yes, a ghetto soldier,black man sing oooooo

PAPOOSE:
The soldiers get trained my the leutenant
The leutenant gets all of his orders from the captain
General, when i was young, i got drafted
Sent me to the army of brooklyn, those bastards
Full of soldiers, my homies lay in caskets
They couldn't survive the heat
Just like the mavericks
And I dont buy wolf tickets from niggas
But niggas be wolfin so i walk around wit my clippers
Some of my people was alive for my struggle
But ain't lived to see my success
They wanted to see me make it, but got stripped naked
And layed in the mall cuz of death
So yo now that Im successful
How can i celebrate it?
They died early, so in their eyes I never made it
I ain't goin' give you my life, you gotta take it
Soldier, I'm going out Blazin'

Im a ghetto soldier,desperado oooo
Im a ghetto soldier,good man sing ooooo
Im a ghetto soldier,how white sing ooooo
Yes, a ghetto soldier,black man sing oooooo

PAPOOSE:
We said the same thing at the same time
I ain't knock on wood

Black cat crossed my path, my luck still good
Broke a mirror, I ain't get 7 years of bad luck
Nuttin bad ain't even happened, my left eye jumped
Put my hat on the bed when I walked in the room
Swept my feet, and I ain't even spit on the broom
What im try'na say is, Im not supersticious
Akon what am I ?
((akon)Im a ghetto soldier)
My right hand itchin, been havin money kid
I even opened the unbrella in da crib
Bought my girl some shoes, she ain't walk outta my life
No bad luck, I skipped the po twice
No superstition, just wise intuition
On the battle field get killed or do the killin
By the way my good luck charm is a biscuit
Ghetto soldier to the ended...

Im a ghetto soldier,desperado oooo
Im a ghetto soldier,good man sing ooooo
Im a ghetto soldier,how white sing ooooo
Yes, a ghetto soldier,black man sing oooooo

PAPOOSE:
No pain no gain
All of the trama is killing me
Pain can't swim
Thats why I drown in that Hennesey
Tired of the enemy, runnin to your crib
Slumped you in your fireplace, and have smoke comin outta
Your chimney
I could see straight through your plots and your trickory
It dont mean shit to me, im trying to get to the bottom of it
But I lost a whole lot of my energy
Tryna get to the bottom of a botteless industry
Now-a-days all i got is my pride and my dignity
You ridin with sympathy
They say misery needs company, why keep em company?
You kiddin' me? when I could grab a weapon and put him outta his misery
Says shots asked you to tell you Im not playing!
When you fire back you let me know what chu saying
This gun busting its like an unspoken language
We communicate with our guns, this shit is dangerous

Im a ghetto soldier,desperado oooo
Im a ghetto soldier,good man sing ooooo
Im a ghetto soldier,how white sing ooooo
Yes, a ghetto soldier,black man sing oooooo

Ya know...
