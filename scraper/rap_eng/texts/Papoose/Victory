If i made a title that offend the whole industry
Would yall all say my title in your interviews?
If i came out dissin everyone of yall
Would i sell as much records as these other dudes?
If i said i was retiring but never left
Woulda yall all show me love when i came back?
If i ran the streets for the past two years
Would you respect me or would yousay fuck pap?

Yo where my thugs at?
Cock ya guns back
My headphones ain't loud yo turn up the track
Ok bump that
Homie i run rap
I add on to the game you niggas subtract
Yo where my bloods at?
Throw it up blat
Yo where my cuz at?
He cut you cut him back
They said they tough cats
But they some rugrats
I drop em off on the block and make them pump packs
Only a couple stacks
He tried to duck pap
I sent a shot at his ass
And told him duck that

X2
Ayo bump that
Bump this
Stay hot
Whats this
He broke
He rich
Homie we run this
This a new era
Your heart pumpin in fear
2007 the god number is here

The stronger i become the more yall weaken
So when im at full power your gonna be a weaklin
If my heart still beatin
And my lungs still breathin
My brain still thinkin
Ain't none of yall eatin
Over my dead body and my blood still bleedin
Ima rap rebel
Clap a black metal
Look into my eyes and realize what pap symbol
Lies but wise got pride is that visual
Nah i dont slap high five with you
Hot side guys
Its not my vibe
You just not my size
I cock my 9
Cats got 9 lives get shot 5 times
I cock pistols and blast clap missles
Black its that simple

X2
Bump that
Bump this
Stay hot
Whats this
He broke
He rich
Homie we run this
This a new era
Your heart bumpin in fear
2007 the god number is here

The cops keep printin me
Each of them bums
Bendin up my index finger and squeezin my thumb
Im lookin at him hoping he get it done
The new printing machines in the precent is dumb
Through the speakers i come
With the weed in my lungs
You ever ran into ya enemy deep in the slums?
They scheming on you
And you schemin on them
Then you realize the nigga who you be wit is one
Hell of a big pussy why you beefin wit son?
He keep tappin you
Tellin you they reached for a gun
But he lying just lookin for a reason to run
Ever catch you on the block
Slingin dem chums
I beat you like them african boys be beatin them drums
Why would i start eating with them and they starvin
Might as well say im feeding these bums
I dont like them niggas
I be talking greasy to them
They say pap a slick talker
That boy got grease on his tongue
Im the real beast from the east and im not done
The most official spitting the swift musician
Thats if you listen
Its a simple mission
If his crew missin its his decision
Cuz my intuition end a vision
Its benefiting all my men and women
Who doin bids in a mental prison
But if you wishing to get the griping since you tripin
We gon blast till its the end of class
With quick collision
Cut you from ear to ear
Give incisions
Eat your food like its nutrition
Fuck up ya wig like sick beauticions
I can give you wisdom
Cause its tradition
But if you dissing
I can switch positions
Put missles in him with quick presicion
I don't care if its linen or if its denim
I grip the lemon
Squeeze hit em my enemies
Rip em wit venom in em
Likely to hit the ism after i send you spinnin
