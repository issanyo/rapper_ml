[Hook:]
Whatcha niggas wanna do
Hundred niggas in my crew
Some wear red, some wear blue
Getting money stay true
Where I'm from is like a zoo
Better keep your gun on you
Same shit ain't nothing new
Gettin money stay true
Spit like I got the flu
Get my click tight like glue
Get it right and then we bloom
Gettin money stay true
Whatcha niggas wanna do
Hundred niggas in my crew
Some wear red, some wear blue

[Verse 1: A-Mafia]
Ey yo this one for the team
Keep the gun in my jeans
Put your jumps to the fiends
Finna slums getting green
Where my flow is so sick
Moving blow by the brick
Bank roll when it's thick
Why you always on my dick
Let's get that pace and on my shine
Niggas say I'm on my mind
Making them dollars signs
Hated that's the bottom line
Got the rolls and the jags
These hoes loves my swag
Try to go where my bag
When your tone gon' get back
In the streets I'm a villain
We eat from the dillan
This cheese I'm billing
Throw my feet to the ceiling
Got the crib and a wife
Watch us living in my life
While you hit in the knife
All them niggas so trife

[Hook:]
Whatcha niggas wanna do
Hundred niggas in my crew
Some wear red, some wear blue
Getting money stay true
Where I'm from is like a zoo
Better keep your gun on you
Same shit ain't nothing new
Gettin money stay true
Spit like I got the flu
Get my click tight like glue
Get it right and then we bloom
Gettin money stay true
Whatcha niggas wanna do
Hundred niggas in my crew
Some wear red, some wear blue

[Verse 2: Papoose]
I keep the hawk in my jeans
Floss with the bling
My offense is mean
In New York I'm the king
Selling soft to the fiends
The boss on the scene
Chinese restaurant
Hot sauce on my wings
You get tossed for the cream
Just talk to the queen
In the box but she still make calls from the dean
Carried to mats I walk with them things
2 M's I'm a G like Ross and his team
Mouth forth and you scream
You causing a scene
Blow your brains out
Show your thoughts and your dreams
Ow poor prince is clean
We cautious and keen
Long since we've been
My force is supreme

[Hook:]
Whatcha niggas wanna do
Hundred niggas in my crew
Some wear red, some wear blue
Getting money stay true
Where I'm from is like a zoo
Better keep your gun on you
Same shit ain't nothing new
Gettin money stay true
Spit like I got the flu
Get my click tight like glue
Get it right and then we bloom
Gettin money stay true
Whatcha niggas wanna do
Hundred niggas in my crew
Some wear red, some wear blue
