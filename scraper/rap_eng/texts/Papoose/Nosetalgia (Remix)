[Verse 1: Papoose]
If you fuck with nigga's I don't fuck with, I don't fuck with you
Now it's on between us, what's you wanna do
I got beef with nigga's who be actin' like they fly
If I ever catch him slippin', Imma shot him to the sky
When you club every night, you see the same bitches in the same outfits
The same frontin' nigga
Weed make me paranoid homie, true that
See a car pullin' up, I be like, who that
If you hang with a nigga, just because he gettin' money
That's what a bitch do, I find it kinda funny
If his money slow down, you get thirsty and split
Bitches stay loyal, man that mean you worse than a bitch
I'm from Brooklyn just like Biggie, [?]
Yeah that's my city
Used to call my DJ dizzy [?] from Harlem like Diddy
I bought your brand new CD, believe me that shit was silly
Appreciate your hard work, really, thanks for the frisbee
Support the nigga [?] a couple players is iffy
Like the Lakers almost died when Kobe broke his achilles
Did a remix to Versace, Versace
Dropped it quickly, I got busy
Some even say I did it better than Drizzy
Nigga's in the hood still scheming, they messed up
In the stolen gear, the way car, they crashed up
Face full of scratches when you crash, that glass cut
When it's beef, they don't pass guns, they pass blunts
