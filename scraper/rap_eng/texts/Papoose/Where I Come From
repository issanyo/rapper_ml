What ya'll thought ya'll was safe?
Ya'll thought ya'll wasn't gonna hear my niggas on the Nacirema dream
Thuggers to the death of me
Or should I say to the death of you?
Thugger!

Where I come from a closed mouth don't get fed
Where I come from young boys respect old heads
Where I come from you shut up when you get arrested
And gangstas speak face to face, fuck a text message

Where you come from, ya'll disrespect OG's
Where you come from, ya'll talk to the police
Where you come from niggas never get it shakin
Ya'll be Internet killin, iPhone bangin

I got the Louie's on my feet, true swag, belt LV
You take camera, I stay picture perfect, no RG
Who got that green swag? That our nigga, that's me
Heart of a stone, don't bust the rock, Jay-Z
You stay around pussies, the whole squad coochies
I stay around G's, my whole squad Gucci
Thugger thugger, ain't that a storm muthafucka?
Nigga never had to rap bout me, word to my mother

I spit that fire like I'm propane, niggas call me cocaine
Now I'm in the dope game, used to rock a rope chain
Thugger to the death of me, whole team strike back
Pap already warned ya'll, homie you ain't like that
Real recognize real, we don't complain
Niggas slick talk, end up with a slug in his brain
We run down on em, cutting down on em
Lay on these niggas, from sun up to sun down on em

Where I come from a closed mouth don't get fed
Where I come from young boys respect old heads
Where I come from you shut up when you get arrested
And gangstas speak face to face, fuck a text message

Where you come from, ya'll disrespect OG's
Where you come from, ya'll talk to the police
Where you come from niggas never get it shakin
Ya'll be Internet killin, iPhone bangin

Rap said don't spend it unless you got it in the stash
All said you wanted cop it, fuck it if it's yo last
Papper said it's yo turn ho, get up in that ass
You got style and charisma, give em some pizazz
180 on the dash, you can't ride like me
I did this my whole life, OD, OG
I'm a side block nigga, give respect in the peas
Flying overseas just for me to play your jetski

My pops told me treat your team like everything
Prepare e well, make sure they ready for anything
I give my word, hands down, no funny dreams
Where I become, we get it done by any means
In here I feel it, I'm just waitin
And money make me nervous, my hands shakin
I said geer, I feel it, them niggas hatin
But I don't see it niggas, my family is Thugacation

Where I come from a closed mouth don't get fed
Where I come from young boys respect old heads
Where I come from you shut up when you get arrested
And gangstas speak face to face, fuck a text message

Where you come from, ya'll disrespect OG's
Where you come from, ya'll talk to the police
Where you come from niggas never get it shakin
Ya'll be Internet killin, iPhone bangin

Not cancer, T-Mack on the grind
It's like catchin ruler divine, eatin the swine
I was born to be a Mack, call me T-Mack divine
Life of skater, every day I go brown so every day I'm a shine
I'm Thugercated, so you don't want no problem ho
Rack ice in the chain, call it Dada Stone
I'm with them stickup kids, that's Thanksgaming
It's Pap with Thugacation, we just Nacirema Dreamin

Ayo yo flow is whack, stelin, slippin, better spit it well and shifted
Violate, I lay you down, quicker than a trailer visit
Hella digits, anybody get in, I finish her blood
I run through a sea like sella mission
Your work is garbage, that's the reason why your boys struggle
Train you a lyric, be teaching a hook like Floyd uncle
Runnin for cover when the ratchet ring
I had yo faggot team stripping like a model in a magazine

Where I come from a closed mouth don't get fed
Where I come from young boys respect old heads
Where I come from you shut up when you get arrested
And gangstas speak face to face, fuck a text message

Where you come from, ya'll disrespect OG's
Where you come from, ya'll talk to the police
Where you come from niggas never get it shakin
Ya'll be Internet killin, iPhone bangin
