I'm too skinny they be taking bullets out here
Trying to live life to the fullest out here
I'm too high to lie
I'm too drunk to give a fuck

I heard niggas squashing their beef out here
I thought they were supposed to be G's out here
I heard niggas want peace out here
Smiling, they showing alot of teeth out here
I heard niggas tryin' to scheme out here
I don't care who on this corner I reach out here
What the fuck these niggas think out here
On to that booze nigga I'm a beast out here
My Kony Island niggas deep out here
Won't hesitate to leave the lame sleep out here
Acting like shit sweet out here
Thick as a game, just 'cause it's a beach out here
You said you used to move keys out here
But you ain't even move an OZ out here
Can't fool me out here
Nigga you was running round boosting
You used to be a thief out here

She got them red bottoms on her feet out here
Let's take you to the back seat out here

I used to smoke alot of weed out here
But now I take it easy with the trees out here
I used to run through so many Phillies
Niggas think mic out here
