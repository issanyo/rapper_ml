[Chorus:]
Team up watch my back and I’m watch your back
Tell them hashtag that oh got to team up
Ride till we die eyes starring in the sky
Me and you, you and I
Team up from ashes to dust tell me who can we trust nobody
That's who that's why we got to team up
Job comes first family comes second and the family comes third

[Verse 1:]
When the water runs out well runs dry
What remains still you try please don't cry
You can fail but we still going to try
The feds go by with the red go by
When they go all up to the pale blue sky
Yeah stay true never tell no lie
Never separated stay on the elevator
Freedom on the respirator
But i yell no cry they all overheat
Heads overheat standing by
Baby when I’m gone I’m still your guy
Fell to the ground then held her ground
Told me to hold her down but i held her high
Even when i was low i still was high
I’ll be gunning still Calvin Klein
I got tough and the tough got going
And the love stop flowing and we still survived

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I love no bitch love no woman
We all know you frank because your mother was a woman
You never hold it down nigga you be holding foul
Hard times with your girl  spending every moment proud
You don’t lift her up you just want to see her go down
Make you feel like you a lion yeah i know how you stay
I know how it is black good girl go around
Yeah look this is real fucking like and
I’m so Goddamn fly in every words spoken loud
Should out to you but you're broken  smile
Haters happy to see the king with a broken crown
Thought i was finished but I’m back now
Shining like 24 karats I’m going to jail
Black crime is a drug I’m a smoke a pond
Going to BET awards yeah that's how we tow it down
Show's over it's over now

[Chorus]
