Thug-A
Thug-A-Cation

2Pac had the Outlawz
Biggie Smalls had Junior M.A.F.I.A
50 Cent got the G-Unit
Jay-Z got Roc-A-Fella
They say Jesus had the disciples
I present to y'all the nation of Thug-A-Cation
Awww man, my nigga Tydro with his eyes low
2008 was ours before it even started, is you retarded
Downtown's C-Brown, Snipe, Flipper the Ripper
Mussolini, my niggas strong, we can't go wrong
Tommy Gunz and Al Capo is getting mad dough
Kay Slay eased up
O-Dogg, pusher in the mall, trigger-happy Pappy
And I go by the name of...
Ya'll know what I'mma say already man
Ya'll know what I'mma say
Papoose, Pa-poose

[Hook]
You with the Thug-A, Thug-A, slip a clip in (Bang Bang)
You with them other suckers, suck a dick then (Bang Bang)
You with the Thug-A, Thug-A, ride, yo. (Bang Bang)
You with them other suckers, die slow. (Bang Bang)

You with the Thug-A, Thug-A, slip a clip in (Bang Bang)
You with them other suckers, suck a dick then (same thing)
You with the Thug-A, Thug-A, ride, yo (Bang Bang)
You with them other suckers, die slow

[Verse]
I know you're tired of hearing stories 'bout homicide
I'm bona fide
Promise my life these niggas won't harm a fly
Dance at a disco
Throw rice at a wedding
Won't put shit in a diaper, I bang like a lighter
Cocaine wars, take your chain off
Back them for the dog food, man, this stuff ain't yours
Give me a thousand grams, I'm a let the 4 bang off
It take more than a key to open my domain doors
Broke the RICO, son of Sam, it's some no-name laws
And I slept with your main broad. What's your name? Lord?
They call me, Papoosie, walk with a black Uzi
Two thumbs down, you acting in whack movies
Why you did a song with him? He mad moody
I'll, don't touch me, you got the rap cooties
It's on when I carry the crons and the Caddy
You can get every Tom, Dick, and Harry
Listen
I hit Tom with the long
Dick with the fifth
Harry with the Cali
And hop right in my whip
You won't hear a thing when P banging that toaster
P move in silence just like the "P" in pneumonia
Catch you in the 'ville and chase you from Saratoga
Slump you on the Forn-up's
I get a share cake and feed it
Homie, you get a share cake and eat it
At the end of the day, niggas can't say I cheated
I feel every man should get a fair shake and keep it
I don't put niggas on, then my plans ain't completed
They'd rather listen to hands say then see it
You can walk a horse to the water, but you can't make him drink it
Some niggas treat others bad, can't take the treatment
Treat how you wanna be treated, can't face the beating
Plans ain't strategic. Disagree, they can't make agreements
Snakes in the grass, they give a handshake and dice it
Some niggas think they strong, but yeah, they're the weakest
Trying to prove their strength, give you a handshake and squeeze it
Yeah, I get my hands dirty, my hands ain't the cleanest
If I shake your hand, I give you a handshake and mean it
This mover of music here cause I'm here to make my thesis
And only for my fans' sake, I speak it with the bare face of Jesus
On my neck, my pants there with creases
Authentic kicks, I never wear fake Belices
Low top, uptowns, one of my pair of favorite sneakers
I rock a pair of men's just like the landscape of Egypt
Spit bars to the foreigners, let them translate to English
Naw, you and your mans ain't the deepest
Some artists can sew dreams, everything hear they believe it
So they stuck on the underground, they can't break the cement
When they get into show business, their answer's deceiving
Hear themselves on the radio, so they feel they're succeeding
Business before show, the airplay is needed
First things come first, homie you can't break the sequence
When you make a dope record, your fans can't receive it
Took it right out of rotation. Damn, it's deleted
When the whack records come, yeah they increasing
Give them 90 spins a day. Damn, they repeat it
Just so they can shine, them dudes, there, they competed
Back to the drawing-board, your plans got defeated

You with the Thug-A, Thug-A, ride, yo. (Bang Bang)
You with them other suckers, die slow. (Bang Bang)

You with the Thug-A, Thug-A, slip a clip in (Bang Bang)
You with them other suckers, suck a dick then (same thing)
You with the Thug-A, Thug-A, ride, yo (Bang Bang)
You with them other suckers, die slow
