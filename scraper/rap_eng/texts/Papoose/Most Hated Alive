[Hook:]
You wish that I would die
Don't want me alive
Tell me who am I?
The most hated alive
I wonder why
I'm such a nice guy
Who the fuck am I?
The most hated alive
Everytime I dress fly
You hate my suit and tie
Tell me who am I?
The most hated alive
Everytime I kick a rhyme
You critisize
Who the fuck am I?
The most hated alive

[Verse 1]
Dear hater, you yea hater
Why you still hating on me
Years later
Y'all can't tell me nothing damn haters
I don't speak hater language get a translator
I'm in the hood cause I'm hood fly as a Rolls Royce
You in the hood cause you ain't got no fucking choice
And if you ain't a pussy why you so fucking moist
You weak jealous motherfucker, puppy voice
You know them haters who smiling but really mad at your fame
Everytime you get something new they say they had it already
Faster hate but they really slow
Try to tell 'em something they say they already know
But they don't really know they just act like it
Why you ain't hit the lotto now if you so fucking psychic

[Hook:]
You wish that I would die
Don't want me alive
Tell me who am I?
The most hated alive
I wonder why
I'm such a nice guy
Who the fuck am I?
The most hated alive
Everytime I dress fly
You hate my suit and tie
Tell me who am I?
The most hated alive
Everytime I kick a rhyme
You critisize
Who the fuck am I?
The most hated alive

[Verse 2]
I was around the way with my mens, on the corner
Standing up straight in my stands
This girl pulled up around her way in a van
She jumped out started shaking my hands
She said from all of the Brooklyn rappers you my favourite man
I said, thank you, you my favourite fan
This other rapper heard I'm taking his fans
He gotta do something about it, he taking a stance
Disconnected from the lane straight away from the land
Cause he was the weakest link on a chain of command
Swear it just came out had a dangerous plan
He started a chain of hate so they hate on your man
When he hated you coming after you connecting yourself
To a long chain of hate that started with another rapper
Twitter monkey you not a loaner you're a borrower
Fall from a leader now I see why they call them followers
Hating is a sickness, get well soon
Most hated alive, boi

You wish that I would die
Don't want me alive
Tell me who am I?
The most hated alive
