[Hook]
Keep the ratchet with' me! Keep the ratchet with me!
Keep the ratchet with' me! I squeeze it 'til it's empty, sniiiitch!
Keep the ratchet with' me! Keep the ratchet with me!
Keep the ratchet with' me! I squeeze it 'til it's empty...

[Bridge]
I rep N-Y, I'm so Bedstuy!
Some claim that Crips, I'm rep the 5
I live by the rules, I ain't fake no moves
Never one shot! - You can get the whole damn room!

[Verse]
Cause I keep the ratchet with me! Keep the ratchet with me!
Tote it on the reggy, I'm a lean 'em if they test me
Move like Makaveli, keep it in my Pelle-Pelle
Got the Se-Se-Se-Se-Semi sippin' Henny, come an' get me!
A Deli Machede, I'll poke you in ya belly
Put the Hammer in your mouth like - Akinyele!
You peanut-butter, jelly! - I'm Fonzarelly Willy
Try me, I'll put somethin' in your top like Skelly
I'm so 'Stuy, I'm so deadly; why you think these rappers worry
Chase 'em like - Tom & Jerry, little girl, R. Kelly!
Hit 'em in a hurry, you get cremated or buried
Though I get alot of Feddi, I want more like Demi
Start frontin' and bustin' cause we be straight stuntin'!
You don't want nothin', hit your brother and your cousin
Have these lames front tuckin' when we get the gun clutchin'!
We touch 'em! Shoot in the head! - Infrared...
