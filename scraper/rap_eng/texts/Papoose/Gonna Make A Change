[Micheal Jackson]
See the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs...

[Verse 1: Papoose]
This remind me of the block party, back in the day we used to jam the most
Used to plug the music into the lampost
I reminisce too much but if a man don't
He might forget where he came from and can't approach
The place he tryna go, a wise man won't
I ain't at the top yet but I'm so damn close
My poems honest, so modest, I can't boast
Fast food I can't coat, I took home cooking for granted
Cause I couldn't imagine, These girls can't cook
They so into fashion, I like 'em cause I'm so into passion
But man when I was growin' up my mama was multi-tasking
She was frying chicken while holding the phone
Between her face and shoulder and smokin' a bone
Combing my sister's hair, she think she's grown
But her hair was so nappy, it broke the comb!

[Hook: Micheal Jackson]
Gonna make a change...
For once in my life...
It's gonna feel real good...
Gonna make a difference...
Gonna make it right...

[Verse 2: Papoose]
R.I.P. to Luther Vandross
A house ain't a home without yo fam close
I get phone calls saying: "Pap come save me
I hear you on the radio you're buzzing like crazy
I'm out here in the jungle with me gun of safety
Repping for your name, these niggas can't take me."
Reply: "I'm still tryna save myself
The industry is all fam, don't mistake it for wealth."
Couple days later, I heard somebody laid him
Thinking to myself: "Maybe I coulda saved him?"
Some say they never change, but let money change them
They change for the worst so they start fating
Some niggas go to jail and come home praising
The most high telling you he's so amazing
Some people spend their whole life committing the same sin
I guess it'll only take death to change them

[Hook: Micheal Jackson]
Gonna make a change...
For once in my life...
It's gonna feel real good...
Gonna make a difference...
Gonna make it right...
