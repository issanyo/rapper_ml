[VERSE 1: [Kali]]
Im movin' down the freeway
Steppin on the gas
Switchin' my gears
Try not to crash
The bright city lights got me movin' so fast
One twenty on the dash
Chasin' that cash

You can say I'm speedin'
Tearing up the season
Flied by the cops
Like I ain't even see them
Driving through LA
Right through downtown
Flying through traffic
I gotta slow down

I gotta take it easy
But I don't know how
22 inch rims
Sittin low to the ground
When I trip they scrapin'
Check my location
I'm getting road rage
I ain't got no patience

Im runnin' red lights
Talking on the phone
Ridin' shotgun
With Glasses Malone
With west coast song
Plus statik on the beat
Midnight club
Im a savage on the streets

[Chorus: Termanology]
Im movin' down the freeway
In the fast lane
Anybody see me
Getting cash man
Drinkin' my cup
Well in my hair
Movin my (ssshhh)
Doin my thang

Rollin down the freeway
Catch me if you can
Rollin down the freeway
Well in my hand
Rollin' down the freeway
About a hundred grand
Wrapped in rubber bands
Ma man

[VERSE 2: Glasses Malone]
If you talk bout whips
Talk bout G
Your call hop around
Always talkin bout me
Objects the convo
They're so gonzo
Street Race king
Young head honcho

Left dudes warning
Heat like alonzo
Lost a big bet
The price of a condo
Im so sick

Nike on the cad
Cars too quick
My wife even fast
Thats life in the L
Life on the coast
We live in the car
Head wrapped around turn

Haters get bold
They try anything
Heats get exposed
If you let the semi-flame
Go back to the wheel
Then I flip like gymnastics

Had anything
From Benz to a classic
Hold me on the game
Name it then I add it
Then passed to my team
Feelin' like magic

Dodge on deck
Courtesy of Birdman
Phantom up next
Courtesy of Mac-10
West coast baller
Call us the pac ten
Try that bull
We shoot like paxi

Then at the wink of a eye
Man im gone
Too much motive
You can't catch Malone
I mean like come on man
You think I rap cool behind
The wheel dog I'm ill
Just the god damn fool

[Chorus x2]
