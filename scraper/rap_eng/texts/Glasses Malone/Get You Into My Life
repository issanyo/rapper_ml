[Chorus: Brian McKnight]
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby

[Verse 1: Brian McKnight]
I'll open up the doors for you
Buy up your favorite store for ya
Give up my floor seats at the Lakers
Give up the mule and them forty acres
Just to have you ridin' next to me

[Pre-Chorus: Brian McKnight]
You ain't gotta have sex with me, at first
I wanna be with you, so tell me how it works

[Chorus: Brian McKnight]
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby

[Verse 2]
I'll pull out a chair for you
Satisfy your every care for you
I'll fill up your 'frigerator
Go toe to toe with the Terminator
Just to have you ridin' next to me

[Pre-Chorus: Brian McKnight]
You ain't gotta have sex with me, at first
I wanna be with you, so tell me how it works

[Chorus: Brian McKnight]
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby

[Verse 3: Brian McKnight]
Give you everything you want
Give you everything you need
Give you all I got
Baby, you can count on me
To fulfill your every desire, all your fantasies
(I hear you, Brian)
I need to have you here with me

[Verse 4: Glasses Malone]
I would cop you a new whip, shop with friends you're cool with
Like here's some change, anything [?]
I would lose all of my loose screws, sex drive'll go neutral
You'd allow me to come cruise through you
Don't be fooled, I'm a dub, baby
Lose that pill, we don't need no drugs, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get you down that isle, I can picture  you as my wife
(Girl) say cheese

[Chorus: Brian McKnight]
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
Gotta get you into my life
Get-get-get you into my life
Get you into my life, baby
