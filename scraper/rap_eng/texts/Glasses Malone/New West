[Verse 1: Trizz]
California nigga this is what I represent
Hailing from the southern side
But i'm heaven sent
Red rags
Blue flags
We affiliated
Gang bang where i'm from
This is where it originated
They call me Young Trizz
Newest artist from the west
I'm so sure about my rep
Tat it on my flesh
If you don't know about me yet
You technically in debt
So pay the price and buy my album
To produce my check
The youngest on my coast
Same chronic different smoke
Seventeen with a style
Unpredictable
I'm invincible to those with no principles
To serve a purpose in this game
Serve you critical
Compton's in my veins
That's how I got the heart in me
The elements to
I feel it in my arteries
Touch down in my state past the line of scrimmage
You won't make it out alive without a death sentence

[Chorus]
Propose a toast where I represent
And do the most
The far left
Better known as the west coast
This is life
Not a fad, fashion, or a trend
We ain't kidding
New west let the games begin
(x2)

[Glasses Malone]
We re-up
So go on
Let the fiends in
The only star
From the California king pin
Watts California king fam
I was ran by Watts California king Cam
My motherfucking kingdom is the East
Niggas gotta play every time he try and eat
It's not a threat
More like protection
Wolf gets buried without the pack leaders blessing
So real shit
Take heed to the message
Because if they start attacking
Ain't no coming to the rescue
They going to rip you up something special
And if that don't do it
Heart will cardiac arrest you
West coast better known as the jungle
Service I provide
On the side
Gonna run you
Or you can take a gamble like some do
And end up the main story on the channel 1 news

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Trizz]
I was born in this west life
Consider it the best life
Money taking over
I'm a victim to the stressed life
Still hold my own
Keep it G like Malone
Getting gangster on these song lyrics
Killing off the dome
Raised to carry a chrome
If you violate my zone
Shoot first
Ask last
California is my home
Cold on the track
But i'm hot as Arizona
The west ain't dead
It's just in a slight coma
Got a word for the East
The Midwest, and the South
With all do respect
Keep the west out your mouth
I'm here to kill this gang
With this mic that I chose
Signed Young Trizz
On a homicide note

[Chorus]
