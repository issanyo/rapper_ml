[Intro: Huey]
(Gun shots) Let's go!
The fuck it is, nigga
H.I.T.Z. Committee, ya dig?
This what the fuck we do, man
From Que Records, to C.B.E.N.T
To the 9-Factor, to mother fucking Trillion Billion Dollar Beats
This is what we do!

[Hook]
24/7-365 on my grind, cause I, I gotta get mine, I gotta get mine [x2]
How you gon' do it, nigga?
(One) Hustle hard nigga, (Two) Stack paper, (Three) Cut the line nigga, (Four) Watch haters
(One) Hustle hard nigga, (Two) Stack paper, 24/7-365 on my grind

[Verse 1: Huey]
Since I grind, these niggas have lost they mind
Hating because I shine from family to all-kind
That's 24/7, everyday of the year
Everyday I am here, I gon' make shit clear
Fuck you, fuck whoever got something to say
'Bout how I handle my business, I'm a do it my way
I am young, I am smart, never small with some heart
I can just taste my money when I hit the airport
You next to overseas, I can smell the palm trees
Guess I'm just a grasshopper, attracted to all green
Now listen to Al Green to bring out the old days
Wishing O.G.'s was still stuck into they old ways
No snitches, no bitching, getting digits by the hour
Ignore the phrase, "More money more power"
As a Mama's boy I hate to see Mama cry
So 24/7 - 365 on my grind, know why?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Maino]
(Listen) Now I'm a get it, I get it until my numbers call
So I'm just a name and a memory on my homie's wall
I be movin' O's, I'm tryna just build my dough up
So I'm just a slab in a Corrimal with my toes up
Niggas deal with jealousy, baby how can they hate on me
I'm a keep it thorough I'm not, not a celebrity
I'm real like a Phoenix Sun, feel like my day is coming
If I can just kill competition, then all the fees will come
You can't stunt on I, the whole Summer's mine
(Hi Hater) Got the country waving hi and bye
Brooklyn to Saint Lou, Brooklyn we can't lose
It's hustle hard, I'm a get it til' I can't move

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Glasses Malone]
It's the waterboy, we keep them bottles Jack
I tell them haters bye, twist it hard and throttle back
What they talking, dollas? We got a lot of that
Cash Money Million, now go and swallow that
Tricks make it rain, we don't carry ones
I'm from 7th Street, now nigga where you from?
It's a gang thang, can't it money counters
All we do is slang, and pray on out-of-towners
Ask around, homie, we some chain-checkers
And we are not the same, so lame run yo' necklace
It's a new West, the whole game respect us
And fuck these old rappers, since they won't accept us
Ask around, G., A clown we spit them breezy raps
And I would trade you nigga's life to bring Eazy back
Man, you niggas wack, you got to coach a dime
I'm 'bout to bring us back, look like the coast is mine

[Hook]
