This is what we need, you decided this
Whatcha say, Oooo
(4x)

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
(C'mon)
G. Malone, still on the block wit' it
Just posted, my steel got some rounds in it
Case haters make a problem and I gotta solve it
Belly leaned against the curtain like an alcoholic
Kill Bill was still kickin' like Lucy Liu
And watch my lil' homies hustle like I used to do
Heard they mad, I got Crips calling troops with rules
What they all turning gang y'all be used to do (?)
Here to stay, the cake leaves 6 summers
Your baby mama already want the dick from 'em
And your sister calling me her Lil' Bust It Baby
While your teenage daughters kiss my poster daily
So crazy, haters scared to start me up
You can't fade me, your clippers ain't sharp enough
Ain't another rapper breathing this smart and tough
So any dummy trying to learn, you better smarten up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
(C'mon)
Call me Weezy Baby (yup)
Hands up, Tec wavin'
Hey now, Lay down like a nigga put a bed down (yeah)
Sleep tight, die in the dirt cheap life
Suit top, tie, and the shirt speech nice
Lumps in throats, trumpet blow (go on)
Where we at daddy, guns and coke (home)
The quiet is woke, the riot's provoked (bomb)
All them busta's allow 'em to suffer (and)
She know not to never fuck around with the fuckers (and)
Stop looking up that mountain above ya
Have you looking under cars, inspecting mufflers (yeah)
That's reality baby, check your calendar
Every day's a new day and this could be the last one (c'mon, yeah)
So you better make it pay off (Yeah)
Or make a nigga scratch a day off (Weezy)

[Verse 3: Glasses Malone]
(Let me take a break from this gangsta shit and holla at them ladies)
Look baby, it's G's over here
Cheese over here, past them lames tryin' holla at ya
And come and ride with a thug, I'm fly as a dove
Switching lanes tossing dolla's at ya
Ain't you tired of them fakes, who lie about the cake?
You can tell them dudes probably actors
But me and Wayne got addiction
And one of 'em trickin', be the one either of us is after
Now getting back to the gudda, back to the corner
Back to the grimy shit
I mean I'm back at the butter, back fillin' quotas
Back trying to find a brick
I heard they 21 again
Connect's gettin' hit and want us to make amends
But really I ain't trippin', homie know I make an end
Cause my whip game is fertile, shit could make a twin nigga
