[Intro: Glasses Malone]
Diddy, yeah, say
I make it look so easy
I make it look so easy
Ballin' in the projects, wherever, nigga
I ain't tuckin' no chains, hah

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
I make it look so easy (Easy, easy)
Louis squares on my beanie
I make it look so easy (Easy, easy)
Gucci stripes on my beanie
I make it look so easy, easy like I ain't try
I'm killin' 'em, I'm killin' em
Bitch, you hear them sirens
I make it look so easy, easy like I ain't try
I'm killin' 'em, I'm killin' em
Bitch, you hear them sirens

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
I make it look so easy (Hey)
Bitch boy, believe me (Hey)
That's real six, that's real six
Shout out to them GP's (Yeah)
Half a bird beneath me (Hey)
Take that on GP (Hey)
My mama passed and I'd give my last
Just to hear her ass scream CP (Yeah)
Brand new and you see me (Look)
Lil' kids like, "You see that?" (Look)
That spaceship, deuce eight fix
Bumpin' Ace Hood with my seat back
Play hood, super burned
East Side, super turned (Yeah)
What that mean?
Before I shoot the fade, I'd rather shoot a French (Gone)
Real bloods that are goin' for me (Go)
Thick hoes that book rooms for me (Room)
She'll wait there 'til I skate there (Yeah)
Fuck a nigga 'til they kneel before me
'Til they kneel before me (Kneel before me)
'Til they kneel before me (Kneel before me)
No 2 Chainz, but that's based on that true story (Hah)
No True jeans 'cause they played out
Robin jeans, flex aimed out
I'm banged out, you get banged on (On)
Tell your bitch you need to hang on
High boots and stress, you ain't goin' with the big price (Big price)
It's that easy (Easy), to change your bitch life

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
I make it look so easy, easy like I ain't try
I'm killin' 'em, I'm killin' em
Bitch, you hear them sirens
I make it look so easy, easy like I ain't try
I'm killin' 'em, I'm killin' em
Bitch, you hear them sirens

[Verse 2: J-Haze]
AK for that bullshit (Brrt)
Water whip and that coke whip (Yeah)
Jadakiss, my hand cocked
I'm feelin' just like Will Smith (Uh)
Ride around in my Solstice
Four-fifths, I'll shoot quick
When I grab that click-clack
Better get back, make your dome shift (Boom boom boom boom)
Bookbag, ten bricks
You buyin' it, I'm sellin' it (I'm sellin' it)
That bitch will suck my dick until I spray kids, Connecticut
Smokin' on my medicine (Yeah)
I make it look so easy (Easy)
Like your ho, I don't want the bitch
She got me and Glass and we peek
In the coke, me and D (Me and D)
You gon' need a shoppin' cart (Yeah)
Haze on the block with more bags than Walmart
Hah, I said Walmart
Fresh fade, Gucci shades (Yeah)
Because I got more chains than Kunta Kente
Name make you pay attention (Pay attention)
Your name will not be mentioned (Nah)
I was just shoestring, your wifey and my dick French kissin'
Zero dollars in the bank, but twenty bricks in the crib
This DMC is easy, but some money on your lil' head

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
I make it look so easy (Easy, easy)
Louis squares on my beanie
I make it look so easy (Easy, easy)
Gucci stripes on my beanie
I make it look so easy, easy like I ain't try
I'm killin' 'em, I'm killin' em
Bitch, you hear them sirens
I make it look so easy, easy like I ain't try
I'm killin' 'em, I'm killin' em
Bitch, you hear them sirens
