[Intro: SpiffyUNO]
Uh Huh, BMG !!!

[Verse 1: SpiffyUNO]
SSI checks, baby mommas and side chicks
Man this South Central lifestyle will leave you lifeless
Back at Foshay, they tried to rob me for my nice kicks
I still had hands regardless of me being 5'6
They had to test me but they seen I wasn't giving up
Had to respect me wen I told em where my people from
They was looking for a nigga they can mop the flow with
I told them, man my uncle he a O.G. from yo set
They said oh fasho, he yo folks?
On the set you got a problem cuz let us know
And...I said cool & went about my day
It's like that y'all when you reside from L.A
After school I would hit the donut shop
That was the spot so I knew it was fasho going to pop
I would always meet a female there so I would let them know
Across from the gas station, Western and Expo

[Hook: SpiffyUNO]
I reside from the West Side (West Side)
I reside from the West Side
(Now everybody let me see you put your dubs up)
I reside from the (West Side)
I reside from the (West Side)
What you drinking on, put your cups up

[Verse 2: SpiffyUNO]
And my Audubon days them was crazy too
Fist fights on the bus had me late for school
Gang riots, Gang fights, the school even made the news
They ain't have no respect, them niggas really hated blue
Whenever niggas had problems in the classroom
When the bell rang we chunk it out up in the bathroom
You had to really be with it you couldn't act cool
Let them niggas find out you was bluffing it was bad news
I knew the bloods and The crips but It was crazy
I always in some drama R.I.P to Mr. Daily
That's South Central for you, every day could be shady
Plus you had to be tough it was appealing to the ladies
The stumping grounds Nah I'm just making noise
Always passing by the liquor store where they shot Baby Boy
To head to Lemeirt Park and vibe out
The city got it's ups and downs but I love the lifestyle

[Hook: SpiffyUNO]
I reside from the West Side (West Side)
(Now everybody let me see you put your dubs up)
I reside from the (West Side)
I reside from the (West Side)

[Hook: Glasses Malone]
What about the east tho?
I reside from the East Side (Spiffy)
Chea!

[Verse: Glasses Malone]
The City, The Hub, The Wood, The Beach
The Bottoms, C-arson, Welcome to the East
Welcome to the beef
Every hood so close, so it's never no peace
Never turnt down, forever turnt up
School of hard knock but naan nigga learn nigga nothin
But how to gang bang and how to chop rocks
And fuck it off on six four Chevy drop top
Fuck cops, them cops gon forever cock block
Uninvited guess and the Choppa knock knock
Choppa in the sky every night man it's clock work
No job in sight but every young nigga got work
If he ain't trappin then that young nigga flockin
If Carlos don't know him then that nigga ain't poppin
Who ain't spend bands at the Carson Men's Land
Third world country bitches get implants
Eastside Shit....

[Hook: Glasses Malone]
I reside from the East Side
I reside from the East Side
I reside from the East Side
I reside from the East Side

[Outro: Glasses Malone]
