[Hook - QP]
We could get it poppin' if it's on
QP, Crooked I with the Glasses Malone
Yeah, let me introduce myself, myself
Let me introduce myself, uh huh
Now you're gettin' touched with the reach
San Diego representin' with Watts and Long Beach
Yeah, let me introduce myself, myself
Let me introduce myself, uh huh

[Verse 1 - QP]
No intro needed, QP got 'em waitin'
Black Dickies and Chuck T's with a SD fitted
The monster, still rumble with sasquatch to stomp ya
New west certified, loc if you heard of I
Heard of me, QP to bring heat
I'm crooked to spit bars, I'm alone like a G
Nikes and white T with a ice piece
Blue flag hang left, bang SDC
The rap game found me, I'mma clap you in the streets
Still the truth in the booth, I'm only sayin' what I see
It's real in the Ville, no need for the act hard
We can make it crack from your block to the foreyard
Still bang gang, they label me outlaw
Leftcoast rider so they call me a southpaw
Real with the steal, QP is a beast
San Diego frontlinin' from the streets of South Beach

[Hook - Crooked I]
We could get it poppin' if it's on
QP, Crooked I with the Glasses Malone
Yeah, let me introduce myself, myself
Let me introduce myself, uh huh
Now you're gettin' touched with the reach
San Diego representin' with Watts and Long Beach
Yeah, let me introduce myself, myself
Let me introduce myself

[Verse 2 - Crooked I]
Now Eazy-E had his lowrider, breakin' 'em down
Crooked I got the Mazaradi scrapin' the ground
Everybody scared of me takin' the crown
Pac took it to his grave so it's safe and it's sound
But I promise you will not stop a popular boss
On my pops I'mma floss like the rocks in my cross
Stop tryna knock Crooked off
I got the whole beach behind me, just like a yacht pulling off
I get stupid in the street, get foolish with the heat
Then I'm movin' with the beat
You ass-out like a nudist when I creep
This is narcoleptic flow, I do this in my sleep
The whole eastside Watts, they know the kid is raw
Me and Sauce Da Boss, bouncin' down Wilmershaw
Baby say she want a thug, white T and tatted
Anger management, girl I ain't mad at it

[Hook - Glasses Malone]
We could get it poppin' if it's on
QP, Crooked I, Young Glasses Malone
Yeah, let me introduce myself, myself
Let me introduce myself, uh huh
Now you're gettin' touched with the reach
San Diego representin' with Watts and Long Beach
Yeah, let me introduce myself, myself
Let me introduce myself

[Verse 3 - Glasses Malone]
Look, homes I'm the truth
Bars so hot it melt the foam in the booth
Mic jealous, headphones get to hear a nigga too
After that, it's a wrap, I'm on the phone in the Coupe
Ain't another new nigga with a Bentley in the street
Rims tall, shit they could play center for the Heat
On Watts, I got reach to the Bay
There's what it is, I'm L.A.'s Mac Dre
Came with the town, all these other niggas fake
The maniquins standin' in a real niggas place
Bunch of posers, who closer to a mill?
On the real, fuck skills, I'm focused on the scrill
Half a mill on the grill, fifty racks on the bike
And the Bloods show me love like my rag to the right
G hop out shinin', hoes stare at the kid
They love me, I might run for mayor in this bitch

[Hook - QP]
We could get it poppin' if it's on
QP, Crooked I with the Glasses Malone
Yeah, let me introduce myself, myself
Let me introduce myself, uh huh
Now you're gettin' touched with the reach
San Diego representin' with Watts and Long Beach
Yeah, let me introduce myself, myself
Let me introduce myself, uh huh
