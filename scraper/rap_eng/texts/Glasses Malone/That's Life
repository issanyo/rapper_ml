[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
And so it seems
Some people get a kick, stompin' on the dream
That’s life (That's life)
And so it seems
Some people get a kick, stompin' on the dream
That’s life (That's life)
But I never let it get me down
Never-never let it get me down
That's life (That's life)
But I never let it get me down
Never-never let it get me down
That's life (That's life)

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
That's what some people say when you ridin' high and able
Shot down in May, that’s life (That’s life)
But I'ma change these haters’ tunes
When I pull that Stingray out in June (Woo, kill 'em)
I been down (To the ground), and that's real life (Real life)
I know what the bottom feel like (Feel like)
I know what the top feel like (Feel like)
And quittin' don’t feel right
So I fill my tank (Fill up)
Keep on truckin' (Keep truckin')
Middle finger up to you hatin' motherfuckers (Fuck you)
Point a finger, I done rolled out a fist (Out a fist)
'Cause it point to where I head in this bitch (Where?)
Yeah, that's the T-O-P, that's on G-O-D (On God)
We all that we motherfuckin' G-O-T (We all we got)
That's from the bottom of my heart
Once again, from the bottom I start
But fuck it, that's life (That's life)

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
And so it seems
Some people get a kick, stompin' on the dream
That's life (That's life)
And so it seems
Some people get a kick, stompin' on the dream
That's life (That's life)
But I never let it get me down
Never-never let it get me down
That's life (That's life)
But I never let it get me down
Never-never let it get me down
That's life (That's life)

[Verse 2: J-Haze]
Yo, I know how them shells feel
No evidence, cold in the jail cell
Nobody believed me, dreams become real
Only thing I know is dope and that fishscale
But that's life (That's life)
The big homie got me out of this
It wasn't for him, I'd still be sellin' your mama bricks
A shame how most of you niggas so counterfeit
My city gangbang as much as Los Angeles
That's life (That's life)
But I never let it get me down (Nah)
Same niggas hatin' wanna cop verses now
Remember when I was coppin' stupid out of town?
Boy, you ain't never hustled 'less you touch a pound
That's life (That's life)
Just a stick-up kid gettin' rich
A dope dealer that talk with too many whips
DMC is my clique
So don't ask why your girl's is gettin' frisked
Lil' homie, that's life (That's life)

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
And so it seems
Some people get a kick, stompin' on the dream
That's life (That's life)
And so it seems
Some people get a kick, stompin' on the dream
That's life (That's life)
But I never let it get me down
Never-never let it get me down
That's life (That's life)
But I never let it get me down
Never-never let it get me down
That's life (That's life)
