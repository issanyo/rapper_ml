[Intro]

[Verse 1: Ricky Rude]
I'm on my way, yeah, to getting my dough up now
I got this chick from Uptown doing the up-down
And when I touch down, you better duck down
Cause when I clap clap, there's no clap back
And fuck Jordan's man, and fuck snapbacks
I wear boots man, and drive classics
I'mma class act, bitch pass that
I'mma do my numbers: NASDAQ
I attack tracks, smoke outta gas masks
And if I crash that, I'll just laugh black
Where the cash at? You better tap Mac
Or get opened up like a fucking hatchback
And that's an exact fact

[Verse 2: Ricky Rude]
I'm too high for fuck-tion so I'm getting suction
At a public function I'll be smashing like Pumpkins
So for now, just keep sucking it, just don't bite down
I'm fucking the bitch - ass up, face down
I'm juggling six girlfriends right now
I'm smuggling six piff pounds right now
Going to the top, they're like "quick, Rick, get down"
I'm like kill yourself, here's a shovel, dig down
Cause motherfucker I stay around people with good news
And motherfucker I stay in places with good views
I'm just a good dude, you caught me in a good mood
I am so Jersey, I am so rude
Now that might be an oxy-fucking-moron
But we grew up selling the Oxys to morons
So of course things are good and all appreciated
Bitch we made it
Only way to fight fear is to face it
No guts, no glory, that's just my story
I would say hi hater, But I'm too high hater
I'll be in Dubai later, with all my paper
With no fucking neighbors
I'll see you fuckers later
