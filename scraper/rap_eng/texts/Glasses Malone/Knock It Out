[Chorus: Glasses Malone and B.o.B.]
Beat it up, now I'mma knock it out
Beat it up, now I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out
Beat it up, now I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out, I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out, I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out, I'mma knock it out
Beat it up, now I'mma knock it out

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
I knock it out the box, but now [?]
Non-stop, baby did you get enough? (Did you?)
Her boyfriend hating cause she gave it up
So generous, I'm needy
Play you long time, no Speedy (Gonzalez)
Arriba! Arriba!
New purse for my diva
Debo, chains tucked when I come around
We don't fuck around with the fuck around-
Heard she got the sucky-sucky crown (bitch)
All shaggy doggy now
12th round, but girl you might quit
All I do is win, so you know the fight fixed
Like that, nah, it's like this (like what?)

[Chorus: Glasses Malone and B.o.B.]
Beat it up, now I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out
Beat it up, now I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out, I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out, I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out, I'mma knock it out
Beat it up, now I'mma knock it out

[Verse 2: B.o.B.]
I'mma knock it out, I'mma knock it out (referee)
You ain't gotta count, you ain't gotta count (TKO)
Knock it out the park, knock it out the town (oh my god)
Pussy wet, boy, that pussy 'bout to drown
Barry Bonds in the box
Throw it at me if you wanna, I'mma hit another homerun
I'mma hit it with a [?], she a hippie, I'm a stoner
I'mma pass it to my homie like I don't even wanna
Grand Slam, Jean-Claude van Damme
Out cold, someone call an ambulance
Or a paramedic to help with the fetish
I beat it like Sugar Ray now the bitch is a diabetic (Ooh, damn)
I'm coming through, I'm wrecking some
Pussy looking like it got into a wreck or some (skrr)
Run it like a marathon
I work it like a Mexican

[Chorus: Glasses Malone and B.o.B.]
I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out
Beat it up, now I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out, I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out, I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out, I'mma knock it out
Beat it up, now I'mma knock it out

[Bridge: Glasses Malone and B.o.B.]
I knock it out the box
Knock-knock-knock it out the box
I'mma knock it out
I knock it out the box
Knock-knock-knock it out the box
I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out

[Chorus: Glasses Malone and B.o.B.]
Beat it up, now I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out
Beat it up, now I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out, I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out, I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out
I'mma knock it out, I'mma knock it out
Beat it up, now I'mma knock it out
