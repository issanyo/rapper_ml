Rihanna, Rihanna, Rihanna...

[Verse 1]
91 east to Cerrito
When I got text, detour!
Damn, what baby hittin' me for?
Blowin up my phone make it C4

What's crackin', what's the word, what's the word baby?
Said she kicked that nigga to the curb
And she love the way that I rap
She want that pussy recorded on the set

G, R, and J, nigga wears rough like
So she want a gangsta, well hash-tag thuglife
Get into that pussy, do it like it's dissin'
Got a couple extra hints and I can get you what you missin'

Say you want a slap, leave a couple handprints
Knocked out unconscious on the canvass, first seen her
Yea I'm talkin' Ri-Rihanna, tellin' me to beat it up

I'mma treat it like Rihanna!

[Hook]
Treat it like Rihanna!
Beat it up, beat it up
Cause playin' with the pussy ain't enough
I'mma treat it like Rihanna!
Bitch, call me Chris Brown
She love how a nigga put it down
When I treat it like Rihanna
Treat it like Rihanna
Treat it like Rihanna

[Verse 2]
I love a freaky island bitch, now I beat
I beat til she out of it (Hey!)
I love a freaky island bitch, now I beat
I beat til she out of it (Hey!)
I love a freaky island bitch, now I beat
Beat beat til she out of it (Hey!)

I love a freaky island bitch, real nigga
You fuck boys counterfeit
And I count count money like a bank
??? 760 gettin' head from a skank
I can tell you what it is and I can tell you what it ain't
Catch you to that telly, girl it's on til you faint
Put you on a frame, have you open like a Walmart
Kno-knock it out the ballpark
Let me start, got you wetted in the sauna
Beggin' me to beat it up

I'mma treat it like Rihanna!

[Hook]
Treat it like Rihanna!
Beat it up, beat it up
Cuz playin' with the pussy ain't enough

I'mma treat it like Rihanna!
Bitch, call me Chris Brown
She love how a nigga put it down

When I treat it like Rihanna
Treat it like Rihanna
Treat it like Rihanna
