[Intro]
Let's go

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
Guess who in the building? (Guess)
Young Lionel Richie, dancin’ on the ceiling (Haha)
Feelin' good, came from drug dealin'
Nigga still drug dealin’, just now I'm gettin' millions (Millions)
Whip fresh to death, yeah this motherfucker killin' (Killin')
It ought to be arrested, why, wearin' shit is stealin'? (Tell 'em)
On the ceiling like I’m ridin’ in the Raider (Raider)
Sittin' on Kobes, ballin’ like the Lakers (Ballin')
Your bitch lookin' good, lil' homie, ’bout to take her
Wherever she wanna go, the kid got paper (Got paper)
Say the kid got paper
And a motherfuckin' pencil for you motherfuckin' haters (Rrah)
Full of lead (Lead), filled with hollows
But never mind him, girl, keep bringin' bottles (Keep bringin')
VIP filled with goons and top models (Yeah)
Watch his ho function like it ain't no tomorrow, what's up?

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to the fast life
Rosé out the bottle got me feeling right
Drinkin' away all my sorrows
'Cause I do it real big, and I get it how I live
And I'm livin' for today
Ain't thinkin' about tomorrow

[Verse 2: J-Haze]
Yeah, case of the rosé
With your baby mama and I'm feelin' on her booty (Yeah)
No high tight jeans, you niggas fruity (Hah)
Ladies love J, they call me LL Cool Haze
I said LL Cool Haze
Still on the block servin' fiends like Luke Cage (Luke Cage)
Man feel like toothpaste, give you a toothache (Nah)
If you need six birds, bring me a hundred in a suitcase (Yeah)
Your bitch on my magic stick, call her Buffy (Yeah)
Cops wanna bust me (Okay)
'Cause I got more white boys than Sandusky
Man I got hoes from Pittsburgh to Kentucky
Catch my ho, lil' Chucky
Nothin' but bad bitches in the VIP
A hundred bottles, a hundred goons, it must be DMC
We pass your ho like a bottle of Hennessy
So chill when I roll a pound of this OG

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to the fast life
Rosé out the bottle got me feeling right
Drinkin' away all my sorrows
'Cause I do it real big, and I get it how I live
And I'm livin' for today
Ain't thinkin' about tomorrow
