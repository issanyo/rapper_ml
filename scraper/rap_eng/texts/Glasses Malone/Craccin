Bugsy on the beat, bitch

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
Where I'm from, I'm a factor (I'm a factor)
Where you from, you a actor (You a actor)
Don't like it? Nigga, we can get it craccin'
We can-we can get it craccin', we can-we can get it craccin'
Craccin', where I'm from, I'm a factor (I'm a factor)
Where you from, you a actor (You a actor)

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
Craccin', where I'm from, I'm a factor (Factor)
Face me, get smacked, bruh (Smacked, bruh)
It's Bobby Johnson, I'm the smackman (Smackman)
Potato on the barrel, nigga, bam, bam (Boom)
No Bonnie, no Betty (No Betty, nigga)
She ain't fuckin', then a bitch ain't ready (Ain't ready, nigga)
Nightmare on 7th Street, no Freddy
Just shot, we out gettin' fetti (Gettin' fetti, nigga)
Bitch bad, everybody want her, now I want her
Bitch bad, I just sit her in the corner (In the corner)
But she mine, yeah, I'm the owner (I'm the owner)
Hold your tongue, spit and you a goner (You a goner)
On the set, fuck a threat, that's a promise
No ifs, ands or buts, yeah we out here gettin' commas (Gettin' commas)
Hey, eat fish like piranhas (Like piranhas, nigga)
On mamas, I'm tryna fuck Madonna 'round this mothafucka

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
Where I'm from, I'm a factor (I'm a factor)
Where you from, you a actor (You a actor)

[Verse 2: J-Haze]
Yo, cool, I keep it cracced than a bitch with the Cali
Boy, I got that white like Bill O'Reilly
The guy fiends porkin' like Miley (Miley)
The hammer turn your face into a season finale
Ass out, parked, you wanna get high like Tali'?
I got more toys than Milton Bradley
Spray up the side of your Caddy (Boom, boom, boom)
Now you runnin' off like Shaggy and Daphne
Dots on your face like acne
Got a lil' bread, now these hoes wanna trap me (Facts)
Nigga, I get more dough than an athlete
Hoes runnin' towards me just like a track meet, exactly
Even in church, I got that thing on me
Don't need a rev' to know this is DMC
Your girl like to think she gon' get this D
Been sellin' bedrock since O.P.P., nigga

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
Where I'm from, I'm a factor (I'm a factor)
Where you from, you a actor (You a actor)
Don't like it? Nigga, we can get it craccin'
We can-we can get it craccin', we can-we can get it craccin'
Craccin', where I'm from, I'm a factor (I'm a factor)
Where you from, you a actor (You a actor)
Don't like it? Nigga, we can get it craccin'
We can-we can get it craccin', we can-we can get it craccin'
Craccin'
