You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket
But I'mma keep it hood, I ain’t got no other option
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging
You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket
I'mma keep it hood, I ain’t got no other option
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging

Rich and bitch, LV’s on my kicks
And you know I switch whips like my draws and my fits
Cleaner than a pimp with a purple kush stitch, right?
You know I’m trying to ball like I’m fresh off the bench
Bentley on my wrist, phantom on my neck
See I’m fresh about the bricks but still got them on deck
Life is a movie and you acting on my set
When I yell cut you’ll never work in this town again
I’ll be moving so mean hood nigga with a dream
Gotta stay strapped so I don’t get Martin Luther King
Product of the crime rate, broke niggers why I hate
Take me out the hood but can’t change a nigga mind of state

You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket
But I'mma keep it hood, I ain’t got no other option
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging
You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket
I'mma keep it hood, I ain’t got no other option
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging

… to boutiques I can’t pronounce
Talking not real amounts the cash is … to count
Now that’s cash, fuck bank accounts
The shoe box old just in case I gotta bounce
On the law, cause we ball, night in and night out
The shooters all around, they pull up is like…
Rounds pierce, and I ain’t talking about …
These shots will leave a … nigga … than …
Now back to the Kobe on the rumble bee
Catching rolling through the street is like a tumble …
So my advice to you haters is to come and squeeze
Cause death the only thing that’s gonna humble me

You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket
But I'mma keep it hood, I ain’t got no other option
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging
You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket
I'mma keep it hood, I ain’t got no other option
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging
Yeah, yeah
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging

You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket
But I'mma keep it hood, I ain’t got no other option
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging
You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket
I'mma keep it hood, I ain’t got no other option
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging
