[Intro]
Honeys
This is for the honeys

[Verse 1]
Ain't up on me get educated
Tell the higher ups, cut the paycheck
You don't wanna see me aggravated
Put me with the honeys it get x-rated
Get you on the dance floor, that's my task
Think I wanna take you home now and stab
You cute and that's fasho, pockets never low, so I know you got me if I ever hit ya phone
Ring ring, new number, who dis?
She still think about me if I ever put it in
Back in '01 we used to rock our clothes big
Hung up when she said 'I got fo' kids'
No fear, really I'm the only pro here
Puttin in work and I got the most shares
So I really might leave the store with both pair
I observe...

[Bridge]
Everybody got the same sound now days
Everybody claim they from the town now days
Everybody say they got money
Everybody claim they got a drop top

[Chorus]
All these pretty girls you better pick one
West side the whole time, never switched up
Invite me to ya shit I might twist one
All the real ballers freeze ya wrist up

[Verse 2]
Chili Fritos, Playa's Punch, we been doing this for years yall just catchin' up
Program directors is a little out of touch
Ask her if she fuck with Dom K
She like 'Duh'
Meet up at the pier one time, chop it up
Squares can't figure why these ladies watchin' us
Is it these Gucci suede loafers, I don't know
Been to Cabo, and I dipped the 5.0, I wanna help her out them clothes
Here to stack these O's, the Super Sport sit low with white letters on the toes
Keep a bank roll and never will I fold
Never!

[Bridge]
Everybody got the same sound now days
Everybody claim they from the town now days
Everybody claim they got money
Everybody say they got a drop top

[Verse 3] Mykestro
These niggas ain't got nothing for me
Everybody say they keep a Glock hot
Same nigga take off runnin
Soon as the muthafuckin shots pop
She movin like she ain't got no hubby, yeah
Me and the buddies bout to hot box
Them bitches can't come if they ugly, yeah
All of my boppers gotta be top notch
Look, gangstas don't dance or do the Dougie, yeah
Them titties lookin lovely in they crop top
Gold 100 spokes on the Cutty, uh
The leather Cortez with the high socks

[Chorus]
All these pretty girls you better pick one, (you better pick one)
West side the whole time, never switched up (never switched up)
Invite me to ya shit I might twist one (I might twist one)
All the real ballers freeze ya wrist up

[Outro] Glasses Malone
Wrist up
Check this out nigga, what's better?
A '87 GNX Max Numbers with the pink slip, or a Ferrari nigga, when you on 60 ????
Thought so

[Bridge x2]
Everybody got the same sound now days
Everybody claim they from the town now days
Everybody claim they got money
Everybody say they got a drop top

[Chorus x2]
All these pretty girls you better pick one
West side the whole time, never switched up
Invite me to ya shit I might twist one
All the real ballers freeze ya wrist up

West side the whole time...
