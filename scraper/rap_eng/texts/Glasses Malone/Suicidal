[Hook: King Harris]
Call to flip a double up
My lil' niggas run amok
I pull up to the club, let the Chevy idle
Middle finger to the law I'm feeling suicidal
Yeah, suicidal
Yeah, suicidal
I'll fuck a nigga up I'm feeling suicidal
I just don't give a fuck I think I'm suicidal

[Verse 1: King Harris]
I've been up for 40 days
All my niggas strapped, I'm talking 40 Ks
All my niggas strapped 140 ways
Got money on my head, but can't afford to pay
I tell 'em "meet me at the Double Tree"
She bust that pussy open right in front of me
I tell her "throw it back. Girl, don't you run from me"
I'm suicidal, what the fuck you bitches want from me?

All across the board nigga
Said "You ain't never been shit without your boys, nigga"
Shark waters deep, I heard you been swimming with them kois, nigga
Keep talking slick I have you swimming up to shore, nigga

[Hook: Stevie Stone (Glasses ad-libs)]

[Verse 2: Glasses Malone]
Now let me show you what a 'loc is
I don't know what broke is
Show up, show out, way before show biz
Wavy, feelin' like the back door to that Rolls is
Suicidal
That Phantom screwed me good, my Nig'
Hold up, let me try and find a fuck to give
Can't find it
Fully loaded semi-
No shows in that UK 'til I'm selling out that whip
He's shootin' nines and I'm shootin' mine
And this motherfucker hit me
No joke me, Imma go broke before these record label pimp me
Midwest, to that West Coast I'm the realist nigga rappin'
See me, Nigga greet me
Holla out, what's happening? where we?

[Hook: Stevie Stone]

[Verse 3: Stevie Stone]
Roll call, told 'em "Meet me at the back door"
Line 'em up, load 'em up, klick clack Joe
On some bullshit, hope I make it back yo
It's go time, what you think we got these straps fo'?
I'm having suicidal thoughts, nigga
Walk in the bank, whip out a mask and take it all, nigga
Cut through the station tryna blow up all the cars, nigga
Find me up in the Ocean swimming with some sharks, nigga
Keep it real, think I'm bi-polar
Can hear the loud yelling "Paranoia"
I keep the chevy on idle as I'm aimin' for your vitals and I'm clutchin' on my bottle of rum
