[G. Malone:]
G. Maloneeeeee

Niggas spit fairytale G issue the facts
Not Jeezy but I sold my fair issue of cracc
Not Weezy but Malone got dat huslters music
And them Hustlers use it serve customers to it
Went from 2 to 300 got the mexicans down
Hundred crip hundred bloods hundred mexicans now
Hundred rounds in the clip man who wanna get dumb
With the New West Pres on these A town drums
With the New West Pres daddy callin the plays
And we saccin wack rappers nigga call it a dayy
Down south call um choppers home call it a Kay
Either way ambulances come & haul um away
This Blu Division bitch I'm da soul of da crew
Honeygirls on ma heels like the soul of my shoes
Got toomp in da kitchen let it simmer and cook
Now Kon break it on down & deliver the hook
Let's Gooooooooooooo

[Hook: Akon]
I ain't for all that beefin
Got niggas to bust your head for no reason
Ask around the streets man I'm Certified
Cross seas all my customers are satisfied
See I ain't for all that beefin
Matter of fact I'm trying to chill with the squeezing
Ask around the hood man I'm Certified
And I'd hate to have to put a bullet in your mind

[G. Malone:]
Got da bloods on my team who gone fuc with 'cause
I'm heavy in the streets nigga fucc da club
Make G's bounce & wanna buc da snub
Taking down everything you spending bucks to plug
I was just a little pissed I didn't sign with Jay
A mil plus couple months feelin fine today
Mil plus couple blunts they say he runnin the hood
And I'm laughin at you rap niggas runnin from Suge
Talk greasy on your records stop pushin me hoe
Face 2 face turn bitch you 'lil pussies expose
U a mark I'm a g so when u pop ya checc
U can buy any car but not the streets respect
1 of few gangsta rappers that the streets respect
Plaques & nothin less is what the streets expect
Got toomp in da kitchen let it simmer and cook
Now Kon break it on down & deliver da hook
Let's Gooooooooooooo

[Akon:]

[G. Malone:]
Watts up lil mama watts up
Watts up lil mama watts up
Watts up lil mama watts up
U won't find another nigga spittin easty-er shit
I'm hot on the West hot in the south
Fuc bars nigga hot for puttin gloccs in ya mouth
Fuc bars it's the flow so easy & smooth
Charismatic on the mic like Easy & Cube
No attitude the fuc stoppin the grind
No whitey in my mix homie robbing me blind
Go hyphy in this bitch only problem is time
Cause my Bentley watch broke but got the properest shine
In the base model 5 but the brabus in line
Once I made bacc ends it's the Maybach benz
Got toomp in da kitchen let it simmer and cook
Now Kon break it on down & deliver da hook
