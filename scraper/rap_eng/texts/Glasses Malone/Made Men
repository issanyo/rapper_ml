[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
I don't need extendos (No)
I just draw, apply lead like a pistol (Boom)
That's real talk, scrap the instrumental (Scrap it, nigga)
This whole album's for the mob, nigga been through (Yeah)
That's right, mob nigga, M-O my M-O (What?)
Sherm dealin' Crip, quick to put down his demo (Facts)
Put down that demo, compare me to none (To none)
I got bread, don't compare me to crumbs (Not to crumbs)
It's too real, can't compare me to fake (Not to fakes)
And if a rapper, then compare me to Face (Face Mob)
Uh, I'm a legend, nigga (Legend, nigga)
And J-Haze, that's my brethren, nigga (Brethren, nigga)
And to the left, that's what we pledgin', nigga
Gay ass singin' to the feds, what you tellin', nigga?
First, never second, nigga, witness my ascension (Witness)
My bitch so bad, she deserve detention (Detention)
Whip ice cold, it might melt this summer
I don't got enough gigs for all these bitches' phone numbers (Damn)
You not fuckin' nothin', go'n, bitch (Go'n, bitch)
'Cause made men never want for shit (Never)

[Verse 2: J-Haze]
Nigga, I'm known from Boston to Slauson
You ain't in the trap, you lyin', Calvin Johnson (You lyin')
Throw you in the creek for thinkin' you was Dawson
I stayed with the MAC, you would think I was Rostrum
Bro achieve in three years so what is you talkin'?
Your baby mom knows I'm a stunner, Steve Austin
I'm on the field with the whites, like Tony Romo
Man, I'll shoot a rapper just for the promo
Man, I watch the news just to see my photos
Niggas know I break the laws like Eddie Gordo
Ooh, that's your wifey? Why she starrin' in my porno?
I'm on the block with the bags, you can call me cocoa
Dog, I run with that white bitch, you can call me Toto
Only my bitch is fab and I ain't talkin' Louso (Pittsburgh)
