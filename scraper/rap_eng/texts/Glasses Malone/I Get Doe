[x2]
I bet you think cause you saw me on the TV
That you know my whole life story
Let me tell you something you might not know
Fuck what you're talking bout, bitch I get doe
[x3]
I get doe
I get doe
I get doe, I get doe, I get doe
Bitch I get doe

[Verse 1 - Glasses Malone]
I get doe, nigga watch, I can show you how
Continental GT bitch I'm showin' out
Whenever showing up, I can't control my bowels
Gotta shit on niggas, you know that my colon growl
Fast life, fast cars, ain't no slowing down
Ain't no breaks on my drop, finna flo' it now
It's like the bridal got stuck, heading for the clouds
And the law was on my ass cause they know my file
But on my mama rest in peace, I'm a soldier's child
So ain't no stoppin' for those coppers 'til the road run out
More money, more problems, shit I know it now
But ain't no time to resolve, there's too much doe to count

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Glasses Malone]
I get doe, nigga watch, I can show you how
Continental GT bitch I'm showin' out
Dark body, white guts, call it Colin Powell
When them 24's is out, them hoes be screamin' "owww"
????????????????????????????
Homie made a couple bucks in each and every state
That's why my Chevy skatin' hard on the finest well
Waterboy, trap money, 'fore I signed a deal
I could never picture me bein' ????
Cause after twenty listens you gonna rewind it still
More money, more problems, came to find it's real
But ain't no time to resolve, I'm grindin' for a mil

[Hook]
