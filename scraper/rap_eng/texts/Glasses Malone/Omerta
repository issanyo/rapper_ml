[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
It's an oath I gotta hold up
At least a hundred K when I roll up
Nigga pop shit, leave him swole up
And if the feds ask, I don't know nothin'
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know nothin'
If the pigs ask, I don't know nothin'
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know nothin'
If the feds ask, I don't know nothin'

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
They ask who dope, I don't know nothin' (I don't know nothin')
They ask who smoked him, I don't know nothin' (I don't know nothin')
If they ask whose Range, I don't know nothin' (I don't know nothin')
They ask, "What's your name?", I don't know nothin' (Ha)
Got the worst case of Alzheimer's (Worst case)
And I keep a chalk stick, quick to outline ya (Quick)
Time and time again, rappers paint a picture (What?)
But it's just paint, feds never came to get ya (Never)
In that tiny little box, they bring and sit ya
Shine that light in your face, punch and kick
If not a nigga killed talk (Kill it)
Real niggas today, they ain't real at all (They ain't real at all)
Real niggas today, man, they really soft (Really soft)
And I'm laughin' at you (Laugh), niggas silly, dawg (They silly)
But me, I'm with the get down
Runnin', screamin', "Get down", you stand up, you can sit down (Boom)

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
It's an oath I gotta hold up
At least a hundred K when I roll up
Nigga pop shit, leave him swole up
And if the feds ask, I don't know nothin'
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know nothin'
If the pigs ask, I don't know nothin'
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know nothin'
If the feds ask, I don't know nothin'

[Verse 2: J-Haze]
Yo, if the pigs raid the trap, I don't know nothin'
Whose scale? Whose stamps? I don't know nothin'
Whose crib? Whose straps? I don't know nothin'
They know Haze be choppin' up that Paul Bunyan
I can get you pies 'fore your family die
For the lowest, cops pull me over talkin' 'bout I had a motive
Even Martin knows I'm movin' weight like Mr. Otis
Pack the shotty, I can remove your head right off your shoulders
On Michigan Street
Colt in my jacket while I'm holdin' my neice
I also got two bricks tucked in my briefs
How you a gangsta when you callin' police, nigga?
I be blowin' the pistol
The only think you're blowin' is snot in your tissue
Bitch niggas always said, "Haze, what's your issue?"
Shells in the D.E. bigger than missiles, nigga

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
It's an oath I gotta hold up
At least a hundred K when I roll up
Nigga pop shit, leave him swole up
And if the feds ask, I don't know nothin'
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know nothin'
If the pigs ask, I don't know nothin'
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know nothin'
If the feds ask, I don't know nothin'
