[Hook]
Man, all of these niggas they be talkin' tough
Swearing to God that they'll fuck you up
But they don't want it, no no, said they don't want it
'Cause we'll be the first niggas to call your bluff
Showing you busts so that you mean you tough
'Cause you don't want it, no no, said you don't want it, no no

[Verse 1: Boogie Man]
Well I got a dolla in my chopper and I'll spend it on a nigga
Take my time and keep it steady while I send it on a nigga
Boogie handy with the jammy ain't no thing to cancel Christmas
If there's drama, my piranhas'll tear your frames up and diss you
(It's the cold where I'm from, you fuck around we fuck you up, ain't no in between you cross the line we bound to fuck you up find your whereabouts and touch, study your moves and do the do, put that iron in ya diet while we eating up all the food)
Second coming of Mizzou don't be misled by niggas lies
Ain't no zoo without Boogie, so they can suck a dick and die
Pardon me, but we walk it like we talk it where I'm from
Ain't no living off no niggas name or claim of what he's done
I'm from days where niggas had to be some G's without a gun
Knuckle up and whoop a pussy knock his face off when he bump
I ain't playing, it's a problem when we tripping, niggas dripping
Tucking tail and choppers yell, mercenaries for the missions

[Hook]
Man, all of these niggas they be talkin' tough
Swearing to God that they'll fuck you up
But they don't want it, no no, said they don't want it
'Cause we'll be the first niggas to call your bluff
Showing you busts so that you mean you tough
'Cause you don't want it, no no, said you don't want it, no no

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
I keep these grizzlies from these niggas, they don't want it with my henchmen
When I show up on the scene, they talking something different
And I'm pushing something clean, just to keep these bitches tripping
Locked and loaded with this thing, and she's itching from attention
Not to mention in the car I brought three young goons
And they hungry as a motherfucker, looking for some food
They been drinking all day so they in a bad mood
One mistake and they won't hesitate to put you on the news
What I'm saying, I ain't playing, I'm one hundred with it nigga
Gutter ties, nationwide, keep some gunners with me nigga
I can hit you down in Inglewood or touch it down south
So be careful who you speaking with, watch your fuckin' mouth
So be careful who you sleeping with, or I'll be in your house
Same bitches that you creeping with, be tryna set you out
Don't get it twisted, yea I'm with it, but I'd rather get this bread
I just had to let you know boy, I heard that shit you said

[Hook]
Man, all of these niggas they be talkin' tough
Swearing to God that they'll fuck you up
But they don't want it, no no, said they don't want it
'Cause we'll be the first niggas to call your bluff
Showing you busts so that you mean you tough
'Cause you don't want it, no no, said you don't want it, no no

[Verse 3: Glasses Malone]
Yea, yea all that tough talk is sound, huh
That's all you need today, microphone and sound card
Tell me something, who the fuck you think you clowns are
This ain't a circus, ain't no bear on no round ball
It's a bear alright, thirsty for a fucking chase
I'm the bad pussy, you the motherfucking prey
So stand down, I stand up, then I swipe your face
Eat you up, then it's back to watch the hibernate
It's a jungle, the strong'll survive
Climb up the wrong tree, get shown a surprise
A brand-spanking new, loaded Colt 45
I call it Gwen Stephani, known to blow your mind
Nigga, E to the A, you can get got
In broad day, on broad way, right in front off cops
Cocked and loaded, I'm groomed for the joint
And down to serve life just to prove a fucking point

[Hook]
Man, all of these niggas they be talkin' tough
Swearing to God that they'll fuck you up
But they don't want it, no no, said they don't want it
'Cause we'll be the first niggas to call your bluff
Showing you busts so that you mean you tough
'Cause you don't want it, no no, said you don't want it, no no
