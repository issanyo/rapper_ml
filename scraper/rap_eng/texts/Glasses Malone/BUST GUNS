[Chorus: Glasses Malone & J-Haze]
I bang 'em, sewed the cap with a red beam
Never four pound me, 106 to Park, sellin' em Roxy (Okay)
Them is white, look like Oxy
You can tell the stones got right on me (What up)
Nigga, shots will make you fly like a spaceship
Beef? War, nigga, don't wanna face it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Make her say nasty, that makes it great (Yeah)
Make her take the wine with the beef because I'm so anxious (Hahaha)
Nigga, please have the money or don't holla
'Cause I'll put that nigga in Philly on, reload (What up)
Pull up on you, tinted up Impala (Nyoom)
Bring slugs to you the size of brass dollars (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Huh, bust guns, J, J

[Verse 2: J-Haze]
I done bust nines, I bust MACs
You bust yours, I bust back (Bow)
My bust down will bust round
Bust me, I'll bust out (Go)
Ask Buck, I got bucks
Get bucks, get touched (Boom)
Knocked down, don't get up (Boom)
No white flag, no give up (Nah)
No mercy, nigga, my slide too cold
Heat a nigga 'cause I'm tryna grow old
Beat a nigga, my nine explode (Boom)
You's a broad, nigga, don't get exposed
Act tough, real cut quick
Back up, not the one to fuck with
I'm aged, nigga, get laid, nigga
G-L, made, nigga (Yeah)
Butler, maids, nigga (Maids)
Sub Zs, Kool-Aid, nigga (Ha)
Brand new Cool Grays, nigga (Grays)
Don't know? Them Js, nigga (Js)
That's all we wear out here
Bitch, I'm swaggin', bitch, I'm swaggin' (Swaggin')
Step street crippin'
Chase a pussy nigga ass and now I-

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
