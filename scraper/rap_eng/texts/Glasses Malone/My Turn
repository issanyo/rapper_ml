Things can't go gonna [?]
We live with George [?]
It's my turn if you're wondering
It's been the [?]

I wait hard for the shit I had to flow without the [?]
Days I go without a [?] while I roll without a steal
Suck that I'll be dead before I go without a damn nigga
So hard to begin start slanging quit jobs to go hard with the [?]
All the [?] that I had music [?] when the [?] of magazines I had articles in
And the mixtape I sell tomorrow f*ckers they [?]
Don't' f*ck the [?] now won't be [?]
To niggas disrespecting like [?] in the square but face to face
Pussy niggas not going to jail 'cause [?] tryin to [?] but the paper was low
And you haters who don't really want my paper to grow
God blessing to my fan kept me able to flow
So raise the bottle to the glass single [?]

[Chorus:]
I come from the [?] like peasants I'm a learn life lessons
It's time for y'all to seat back and observe my lessons
It is what it is you can't blur my message
I've been turned to forgive I deserve my blessings
These kids won't gonna [?] we live with Georgia [?]
It's my turn if you're wondering [?] don't coming

You came up the gutter way
But mother f*cker stay neglected and ignored
Thank you for another day and I just pray to give you the strength
To keep living right and been giving that one tempt
You ain't' blessed us just to blow but every key stack I know
Is just the test though to see how we act
Just the fact that without you we couldn't crack
And show as you gave it to us you can take it back
So please just keep it so huble 'cause I ain't try to [?] till I ball just to have it all [?]
Some go insane with the money and fame see the truth stay the same
Let the sunny [?] I can't [?] tell the niggas what I'm knowing about
Never been [?] that's how I'm going out
So all my keys sparking trees up and toasting [?]
And this is how is supposed to do

[Chorus:]
I come from the [?] like peasants I'm a learn life lessons
It's time for y'all to seat back and observe my lessons
It is what it is you can't blur my message
I've been turned to forgive I deserve my blessings
These kids won't gonna [?] we live with Georgia [?]
It's my turn if you're wondering [?] don't coming
