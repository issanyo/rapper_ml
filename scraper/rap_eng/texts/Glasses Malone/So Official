[Intro: Glasses Malone]
Soundin' like some 80’s D-boy shit, you know what I mean?
Listen to the motherfuckin' drums
G motherfuckin' Malone
YMCMB, ’sup?
Tha Bizness

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
I'm so official
Bentley in the hood, I don't even need a pistol (Why?)
'Cause I'm so official
I'm-I'm so official, I'm-I’m so official (Official)
I’m so official
Nigga, you not, that's why your own homies diss you (Yeah)
But I’m so official
I'm-I'm so official, I'm-I’m so official (Official)

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
Officially the realest
Reelin' hoes in 'cause I'm wieldin' somethin' vicious (Vicious)
Shout to Philly (Philly), I'm sittin' on sixes
Got your baby mama sprung, that's what the dick did
Water by the drums got me watchin' for the dickhead (Hah)
Big work, fuck state, man, this shit fed (So federal)
As long as I'm breathin', man, this shit bread (Cha-ching)
And I'm eatin' (Eatin'), watch me get big (Yeah)
And I ain't worried 'bout the jackers (Nope)
Only thing a nigga fear is God and them crackers (Crackers)
So why these fools got a squad full of rappers?
Nigga, my squad goons, and we all got clappers
Act funny, get a standing ovation
Clap clap, revolver rotatin' (Rotatin')
I fuck with E class, where the Haitians? (Where?)
Free my homies doin' life in the state pen (Yeah)

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
I'm so official
Bentley in the hood, I don't even need a pistol (Why?)
'Cause I'm so official
I'm-I'm so official, I'm-I'm so official (Official)
I'm so official
Nigga, you not, that's why your own homies diss you (Yeah)
But I'm so official
I'm-I'm so official, I'm-I'm so official (Official)

[Verse 2: J-Haze]
Yo, I'm official with the rap
Niggas in the hood know I'm official with the MAC
Your baby mom knows I'm official in the sack
These pigs got me tapped 'cause I'm official in the trap
Yeah, and I'm good on the West Coast
Even in a drought, I'm still sellin' the best dope
Got white boys in the 'burbs with shotguns in they trench coat
The four-fifth touch more boys than Chris Stokes
After the raps and the plaques, I'm still broke
I'ma grab the tool and start robbin' your kinfolk
Niggas think they got a big bread 'cause they eat toast
Don't pay Haze, and your chain will get repoed
You ain't livin' the street code (Nah)
Niggas die every day tryna be heroes (Yeah)
Got Mexicans hidin' kill, and they sell brick roads
Your ho tryna give me brain just like the scarecrow, nigga

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
I'm so official
Bentley in the hood, I don't even need a pistol (Why?)
'Cause I'm so official
I'm-I'm so official, I'm-I'm so official (Official)
I'm so official
Nigga, you not, that's why your own homies diss you (Yeah)
But I'm so official
I'm-I'm so official, I'm-I'm so official (Official)
