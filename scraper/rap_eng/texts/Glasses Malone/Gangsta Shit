[Intro]
Rah
DMC
Yeah

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
When it come to them dividends
We can do this like gentlemen
Or we can get into some gangsta shit
We can get into some gangsta shit
When it come to them dividends
We can do this like gentlemen
Or we can get into some gangsta shit
We can get into some gangsta shit

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
Ha, get it crackin' like walnuts (Walnuts)
Find a nigga knee-deep in your broad guts
Buck some, buck some down Broadway
Ain't worried 'bout them jack boys, the pistol with me all day
And I'll give you everything that this clip got (Boom)
Take it back to the days when it was crip-hop (Yeah)
When a dub used to get a smoker six rocks
When 6-6-2 was the strip, ha
Las Vegas, Steelers, Raiders
Five hundred deep, can't nobody fade us (Fade)
Self-made, ain't nobody made us
When you got sprayed ain't nobody sprayed us (Ha)
Blue is the color
Even though I did some shit I put no one above us
Life is a bitch, death is her brother
Sleep is the cousin, yeah, 'cause I love her

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
When it come to them dividends
We can do this like gentlemen
Or we can get into some gangsta shit
We can get into some gangsta shit
When it come to them dividends
We can do this like gentlemen
Or we can get into some gangsta shit
We can get into some gangsta shit

[Verse 2: J-Haze]
Yo, yo
I'm from the south of the 'Burgh, ain't no sunshine
Ask Nick, where them choppers spit, sound like drum line (B-r-r-r)
Only time you busted a Glock is GTA or True Crime
Fiends come to me because I got more bags than food lines
Fool, I am dangerous, too
You lookin' like a bitch, nigga, give me your chain and your shoes
Mission, your block, indo, I'm reppin' the 'Su
Shot him, made his body wet like he just jumped out the pool (Ha)
We comin' crazy, you don't know what to do
Take that money out the bank and buy you some goons
Thought I was Tim Allen, how I pull out the tools
Bullets flyin' everywhere like fuckin' balloons (B-r-r-r)
Movin' heavy D, I'm the over-weight lover, nigga
I move more weight than Biggie put on top of each other
Choppin' up the butter, duckin' undercover
Cut white and get dough from their mothers

[Chorus: Glasses Malone]
When it come to them dividends
We can do this like gentlemen
Or we can get into some gangsta shit
We can get into some gangsta shit
When it come to them dividends
We can do this like gentlemen
Or we can get into some gangsta shit
We can get into some gangsta shit
