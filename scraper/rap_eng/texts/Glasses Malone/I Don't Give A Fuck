[Intro: Chino Grande]
1, 2 - Oh There It Goes
Yeah Wassup?
Shout Out To Nipsey Hussle
(I Don't Give A Fucc)
That's Right
Muthafucen Chino G In The Muthafucken Building
(I Don't Give A Fucc Remix Baby)
What's Crackin' Muthafuckers?
(I Don't Give A Fuck-Fuck)
That's Right
(Fuc-Fuc - Fuc-Fuc)
Still Muthafucken Charlie Row
Life's-Life-Life's A Bitch
Bitch-Bitch Ese Fuck-Fuck It

[Verse 1: Chino Grande]
I Got My LA Dodger Fitted On
Boy You Get Shitted On
Burner On My Lap
And You'll Never Know
Who Did It Holmes
Intellectual - Sharp
Whit A Grimey Dude
Paint A Ave
Tramp Gang Whit A Attitude
Sophisticated Look
Gucci - Prison Monologue
I Studied Culture In The Hole
And Learned Nahuatl
I Lost My Kids & My Bitch
But I'm Still Pushin'
Cause Even When I Ride Around
Bitches Still Lookin'
Couldn't Take My Place
Snakes Smile In Your Face
These Distribution Of The Hollow Tips
Is All It Takes
To Lose Your Soul
Keyshia Cole Said To Let It Go
My Mama Said Son You Better Pay Attention Close
Cause You Ain't Never Know
Roll Cold Like Eskimos
I'm Countin' Dollars
Off The Grams By The Decimals
And I Ain't Trippin'
Isolated Living Born Rugged
Life's A Bitch Ese Fuck It

[Hook: Chino Grande]
I Don't Give A Fuck
Top Down - Seat Back
And Let The D's Spin Round
Parole To The Streets
Where Everything Go Down
Chucking Up The Varrio
When I Hit Your Town
(Chucking Up-Chucking The Varrio)
See I Don't Give A Fuck
Top Down - Seat Back
And Let The D's Spin Round
Parole To The Streets
So Watch The Heat Go Blauw
Chucking Up The Varrio
When I Hit Your Town

What? uh What?

[Verse 2: Chino Grande]
I'm Charlie Row To The Fullest
So I'm Self Paid
The Realest Ever Made Ese
And That'll Never Changed
I'm On My Dub Shit
Something Like An Escalade
I'm Out The Window
Jumping Out & I'll Let It Rain
I Ain't Trippin'
Chino G Got A Mac-11
Pull A Bitch Quick
Off The Dance Floor 2 Stepping
Hard Headed
Gets It While Skin Shedded
Forever Off My Caliber
Authentic But I'll Still Get It
Coco Butter Off My New Bitch
Times Up
Silky Long Black Hair
Plus She Grind Tough
I Know She Fine
But Took Me Round 5 months
To Get It Crackin'
We Attracted To This Life
Cause Everything I Ever Loved
Lost All I Had
Good Gone Bad
Sour Milk & Pound A Tall Can
See I'm The Life Of A Party
Varrio Still Chunkin'
Life's A Bitch Ese Fuck It

[Hook]

I Don't Give A Fuck-Fuck
(Dj Scratches)

Charlie Row - Chino G
G-L - Turn Up

[Verse 3: Glasses Malone]
I'm Fresh From A Funeral
My Homeboy Stake
Shot It Out With A Sucio
We Lost A Shooter
Shootin' Type - Type Of G
(Type Of G)
Since That Day
In My Lap Reside The Heat
East Side Nigga Signed A Deal
And No Sell
Too Real For A Label
Boss Felt I Over Stepped It
Want The Real
Till They Realized
They Can't Go & Check Me
(They Can't Check Me)
Just Cut The Check And Respect It
Except I'm No Accessory
The Lead Suspect
I'm The Lead
Born A Winner
Bitch I Bleed Success
(Its How I Bleed)
Subjected The Scrutiny
Told I Was A Loser
Wouldn't Be Shit
But A Dealer Or A User
So I Chose To Deal
I Chose To Deal
Land Of Ride Or Die
I Chose To Kill
Too Much Script
Only Pussies Won't Touch
Cause Life's A Bitch
Watch Me Fuck

[Hook]
