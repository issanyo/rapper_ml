Dip-Shrek bitch
You know the fuck I hate B, you know?
When I be riding clean with no tints and I pull up
You dig, and I look and I be like

Verse 1 - Feekey Zekey

Freeky, freaked on the stroll, caked on the block
Shit, a wrist chain big man lotta props
Back out the imp, put it to his nodachey
(Hater, what you looking at, what you looking at?)

Pistol whip him said, "Hater, now look at that"
You ain't no freak, big boss half lunatic
Girl magnet, pop shit with his hooligans
Head cracked, trips, Autobenz, Giovanni rims

Click big whip, new metro card, hop a train
Whip thru' the metro honk shorty hoppin' it
Gonna run a train, yea, me and tito poppin'
Dipset popping, tell when we hoppin'

Whole club stopping, all girls jocking
Watch how we pop that bud, get it rocking
Freak style lambo, you dirty dodgin'
Prada be in love, gifts car seats and carpet

Verse 2 - Feekey Zekey

I'm looking sharper than a razor
Smoking on some haze, riding low pro
Chopping on them blades
Two tones digi dash, panoramic tops
Coming down the block, bet you all the bitches jock

Yeah, I ride so dirty but I shine so mean
Candy on the Chevy, that bitch so clean
Swinging does, banging hoes, doing my thing
80 on my neck that bitch ching-a-ling

Yeah, I see you in the streets, looking like fools
Cloudy ass diamonds, thunder storm jewels
Fuck nigga, don't trip, my fours make you holler
Candy paint gators, matching the Impala
Flee brought me in this shit
The nigga razor rider
Keep a full clip so jacked boys holla
Gettin money over here ya niggas should follow
40 in my pocket is a Dipset Motto (Freekey!)

Verse 3 -

I'm a first class hitter, you in coach smelling arm pits
Stone cold sinner, got the heat when I'm flossin'
Hold up your horses, your boy and his horsemen
His move and be cautious
Don't wanna see none of ya'll stiff in the coffin

North gate, flossing, the way I left them all
You think they got extorted
Dipset president, 7 figure office, checks on the
Respect how we morph from
The streets to the desk, and we all came off so

Go and get some paper stacks
Get some paper stacks
Don't wanna be the nigga that sped off
And let the dirt hit
Freaky
