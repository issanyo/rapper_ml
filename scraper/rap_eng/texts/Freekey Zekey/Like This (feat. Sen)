(feat. Sen)

Uh-huh, it's ya boy
Freekey Zeekey

[Verse 1: Freekey Zeekey]
I'm a stone cold criminal, fish put it in with' you
The 5th put it into you, pop like intertubes
Pop bitches into tubes, pop back, send a few
Freek train criminals, dirty socks rapper dudes
Hold ya head, eyes wide
One of yo' wiseguys wanna be the top guy
Probably yo' top guy
Seen it all, nigga roaddog did a bid and all
Drugs wasn't his at all
Niggas never hit 'em all

[Chorus: Sen]
Who else but them niggas they call the Dips
Circle the city in that big 5 or the 6
When them niggas talk shit, throw the barrel to his hips
Oh baby, you never seen a nigga like this
Now, I did shows all around the globe
Bitches on the dick cause of the cars I drove
I'm in the mix, god forbid I get hit
But I guarantee you'll never meet a nigga like this, ooh

[Verse 2: Freekey Zeekey]
BANG, let it off, bet Freek, get it off
Slap niggas fitteds off, true nigga get it off
First nigga set it off, 2-10, pret it all
1-0-2, 3rd Ave (Yeah) where they bred the dog
Times keep my celly off, fam think I'm fallin' off
Baggin' coke (Uh) that grind never put it off
S-550, cocaine freak peeling off
Hard knockin' niggas off
Drove up, pop a dog

[Chorus:]
Who else but them niggas they call the Dips
Circle the city in that big 5 or the 6
When them niggas talk shit, throw the barrel to his hips
Oh baby, you never seen a nigga like this
Now, I did shows all around the globe
Bitches on the dick cause of the cars I drove
I'm in the mix, god forbid I get hit
But I guarantee you'll never meet a nigga like this, ooh

[Verse 3: Freekey Zeekey]
Coke spot, clear it off
Same block, move it off
Insane how the dude was soft
Woulda been enraged like a bull to a matador
Man and all, niggas still pussy like rapers in Central Park
Betty Crocker could make a better cookie in the same pot
I let the coke drop, make the cookie rock in the same pot
Cause I can't play the sideline
Gotta push it through and follow align
I'm on my grind

[Chorus:]
Who else but them niggas they call the Dips
Circle the city in that big 5 or the 6
When them niggas talk shit, throw the barrel to his hips
Oh baby, you never seen a nigga like this
Now, I did shows all around the globe
Bitches on the dick cause of the cars I drove
I'm in the mix, god forbid I get hit
But I guarantee you'll never meet a nigga like this, ooh
