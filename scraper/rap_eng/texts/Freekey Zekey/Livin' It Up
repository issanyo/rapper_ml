[Chorus:]
No matter what they say
No matter what they do
No matter where they go
(Dipset baby)
No matter how they feel
No matter what they think
No matter how they hate
(Dipset baby!)

[Verse 1:]
Crack spot bumpin, key sales jumpin
Weed man dumpin, trunk is thumpin
Party pumpin, shawty stuntin
Ain't this somethin, livin it up
We gangstas baby (Gangstas baby)
Got it baby (Got it baby)
Cake'in ladies, dipset baby, livin it up
Gong beat lobster, style of a mobster
Private jet, freak through the charter
They go hard but we go harder
Never find a body, haul 'em by the harbor

[Chorus:]
No matter what they say
No matter what they do
No matter where they go
(Dipset baby)
No matter how they feel
No matter what they think
No matter how they hate
(Dipset baby!)

[Verse 2:]
Mom's got a jack, Pop's got a 'llac
Diamonds on they neck (Diamonds on they neck)
Lyin' on they decks, set sail lets check
Through uncharted islands, freak on that
I was rillin' on the alley, rippin' niggas necks
Had the whole fam stressed, got signed to a deal
They signed me a check, I signed them a check
Got my whole fam set (Got my whole fam set)
They said I wouldn't make it, never had a chance
Now I'm fresh out the Bentley, check on a friend
Dipset south, flat screens in the house
Seven-thirty dipset, bitch in a mouth

[Chorus:]
No matter what they say
No matter what they do
No matter where they go
(Dipset baby)
No matter how they feel
No matter what they think
No matter how they hate
(Dipset baby!)

[Verse 3:]
I just count ones, that's my word
I go in when they bring it to the crib, men shake they snow in
Party on the counter, just for you rattin his cowards
I need to hit y'all with guns with horsepower
Freak is a real dude in the state remington
Don't need the cage cuz the bird's in the engine
Just bought a crib, eight rooms, all kitchens
And I pimp so hard, I need to stop, make the women
But they don't feel me though
I give it to you girl, put yah planted on my boat, let me rock your world
See I got a whole lot of style, a whole lot of grace
Presidential wait, the funerals in the safe

[Chorus:]
No matter what they say
No matter what they do
No matter where they go
(Dipset baby)
No matter how they feel
No matter what they think
No matter how they hate
(Dipset baby!)

Girl, it's Freekey Zekey
And oh you wanna meet me
Cuz girl, I'm on yo T.V
And you know I'm numba one
