{*Guy talks over beat*}

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Uhh, well I'ma tell you straight up homeboy, cause it's a cold world
Your wife, I call her old girl, her head makes my toes curl
And she awfully thick, help me get off these bricks
Coffee kick, but after I bust, I be like "Get the fuck off me bitch"
If she front, bruise her in the ribs
But you hugged her, you loved her, moved her in the crib
Hit by cupid, stupid, why'd you do it? Why be bother?
Why you holla? Three babies, three baby fathers
Get wise kid, open your eyelids
'Cause that last abortion, that was my kid
That's right, but, that I ain't following
If she get pregnant again, it'd be from swallowing
But once in a while I dive in it
That car you bought I be driving it, head while I'm driving it
Said you like to lay up dog, and play footsies
She need a nigga with Timbs, gats and straight hoodies

[Guy]
Yo, I got Timbs, dog

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Huh well.. huh
She said you gotta get drunk, and I could fuck her better sober
You get 20 grams, and think you fucking Erick Sosa
Better choke her, she the female Bill Clinton
Lie, cheat and smoke, you got her still sitting
Then she bouncing in, so you wanna pounce her in
She gas you up, "I love you, I swear to God we'll go to counseling"
I ain't cherish ya cutie, inherit her booty
Have her wanting to kill you like American Beauty, Killa
'Cause you a motherfucking rest haven
I put a gun to her head, paint a picture like Wes Craven
Ya chest aching 'cause I'm very blunt, ya stunt, wanna cherry pump
Extra kid, a extra check every month
She giving Jimmy head, Juelz in her guts
Dog, you feel in love with a slut, what?

[Chorus]
[Guy] Ayo, what's up with my girl that's my world?
[Cam] (Killa) she a slut hoe
[Guy] That's my life, that's my wife I love her
[Cam] Uh-oh, oh no, oh God
[Guy] Ayo, what's up with my girl that's my world?
[Cam] She a slut hoe
[Guy] That's my live, that's my wife, I love her
[Cam] Uh-oh, oh no, she a slut, she a freak

[Interlude: Cam'ron]
Ayo dog, you gon' call back right?
Matter of fact I ain't even do ya bitch dirty, for real
I'ma let you holla at my man Gruff, he did her dirty for real
Yo Gruff, tell this nigga 'bout his fucking hoe

[Verse 3: McGruff]
Ayo, me and Cam caught her, on camcorder
Dogged her, kicked her out the O
Tell you about ya hoe, she's a bitch
Came right between her lips
You thinking I'm fronting, she got a birth mark between her tits
And money, please stop calling niggas phones harassing
She come home, don't wanna fuck, we boned her back in
You's a creep, and all do is use your freak
And when we done, we send her home for you to keep
You want beef? Punk faggot, we got stupid heat
Ayo, you acting like you want die over pussy
I ain't gon' front, I was hazed up, high in the pussy
Yo, she greet me on GP, you buying the pussy
Breathing hard on the other line, dying to push me
Crime crime, sip fine wine, puff lime, lime
Laughing at the bitch on Primetime
Me and Killa for reala, all of the sudden you wan' be a guerilla
Nigga please, I'm quick to put three in a nigga
You ain't nothing but a sucka for love
She got you thinking it's love
Hit her on the sink and the tub
A little head crack, while a nigga drinking a bub'
You be surprised what ya bitch could do
She did shit to us, she never did to you
That hoe mad physical, cheesy bitch

[Outro: Freekey Zekey Talking]
Yo, give me the motherfucking phone nigga
This stupid ass nigga coming around here
Dailing my number, how the fuck he get the...
Listen nigga, ya BITCH ain't shit anyway
Her pussy no quality, and how the fuck you gonna take
This motherfucking ho to the Hotel?
She ain't nothin' but backseat, backshots
You talking about "Oh I wanna soak ya feet baby
I had a long day, I wanna make you feel right"
She just got finished soaking my dick in her mouth nigga
You put time in this ho, "Oh let me take her out Benihama's
Oh let me get some Dolce & Gabbana"
Motherfucker, I don't even know ya ho
She fucked me off my man deal
Fuck is wrong with you nigga?
You running around trying get her some shit
I left my dick in this bitch
All my niggas got ya ho, you taking 'bout
She telling me, you talking about
"It just slide right in right now"
You know why? Because big dicks up in her nigga
Fuck you think? It just ease in for you
And yo' bitch ain't shit, nigga
I done brought her to my house, fucked her
"Oh, put it in my ass, no, no, no, no not ya dick, ya whole fist"
I turned around, my pop's dick in her mouth
What's going on with this bitch?
