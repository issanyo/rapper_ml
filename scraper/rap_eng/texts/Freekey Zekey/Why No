Yo yo yo yo I'm a nomad nigga

Little broke nigga I ain't have no cash
No threads and no rags
Shit was serious

I'm no pretender
I've been to jail and I know offenders
You I don't know or no remember
But I know you tender
Shit you ain't no exeption
I'm in the hood with no redemption
When you gonna die in life there's no prevention
Why the fuck you put us here when you know we bad
Yeah I was one that would cut you
Cause I came up to with no one to look up to
But the one that sold drugs to the ones with no life
Why the fuck police treatin us like we got no rides

[Cam'ron]
Yo why I can’t live up in Hollow Hills with some model thrills
Why for the dollar bills I got to bottle Crils
Why I got to swallow pills
Why when I’m starvin I got to gobble meals
Why did I cop the steel
Why did I rob Rob for real
Why we can’t wait til our time God could take her
Why the flesh eatin disease make niggas get ate up
Why bitches with a fat ass gotta wear A cup
Why David Stern fuckin the NBA up
Why the great ones always break up
And when travesty happen they wanna make up
Why niggas can’t get caked up and stay caked up
Say what why we can’t tell who’s smart or dumb
Why niggas in blue suits can take us and put us in a orange one
Why Adam and Eve didn’t know what was in the garden dun
Why niggas from America always wanna car thats foreign dun
Why drugs I gotta buy why slugs gotta fly why thugs gotta cry
Why when I get on Blood got to die
Why me and Tai can’t see eye to eye
Why when plane crashes niggas fly to die
Why your word depend on a handshake when you reachin a palm
Why beef with my mom why can’t sleep without Cron
Why on my block I love every fight, why I laughed when they mugged Mary Wright
Why I got to fuck every night
Why Im deep in my ways Why we six feet deep in our graves
Why periods last three to five days
Why we ain’t retrieve the slaves
Why we don’t learn til we leave for the cage
And they say the beasts isnt raised
Why I can’t tell you the whole story just a piece of the page
Whys no such thing as true lies
Why can’t I have two rather a few highs
Whys homos guys that do guys in the world
Why ain’t more girls that wanna do girls
Whys multiple-sclorosis why got multiple of toasters
You know my .45 my .357 but why my shotgun why plot dun
Why man in statue depend on his rocks son
Why my hood fight urges why I seen crook type murders
And niggas get cooked like burgers
Why your girl want my clique why your girl on my dick
Why she rub it against her mouth like it’s chap stick
Why this rap shit
Why CEOs wanna rap why rappers wanna be CEOs
Yo why you dont wanna see me blow
Why the rhetoric why I can’t get my proper etiquette

[Outro]
Better get all your money motherfucker get that said again
I want that money too nigga
Fuck that lil two dollar prude
I wanna get that Cristal shit too nigga
Yeah niggas up in the shit motherfucker
I ain't stoppin I ain't never fuckin stoppin
I ain't never motherfuckin stoppin up in this motherfucker
Nigga you better get some more money cause
We got to tapes up this motherfucker
You better be rich cause we got a lot more shit
I ain't never gonna stop motherfucker
I bet you better believe that
