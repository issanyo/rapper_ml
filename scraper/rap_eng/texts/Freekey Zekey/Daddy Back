Juelz Santana:
They love this slow flow, they love the slow strokes
The bitch want me to lay her, call me Ozo
She love the fast whips, she love the fast dick
She love to jumpoff, we call it a mash pit
Big black Cadillac, extra wheel in the back
Just incase we catch a flat, tell her bitch change that
