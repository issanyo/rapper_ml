{*phone conversation*}

[Intro: Cam'ron]
Uhh, uhh, wave your hands now (lighters in the sky)
Yo I'm looking for a hoe (word) found a hoe (and)
And the hoe ended up being, a hoe (what you thought?)
My man Zeke always told me a hoe's gon' be a hoe let a hoe fly
Let the birds fucking fly, let 'em fly right Zeke, fuck
{Let 'em fly away}

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yo, holla, yo
I need a girl that can sing like Celina, ass like Trina
Tits like Janet, get beat like Tina (have you seen her?)
I mean cake like Oprah, chauffeur
Keep the toaster in the holster (tell me have you seen her?)
I did, yeah I found one a little brown one
And she down son, plus she pushed a Beamer
I should've knew something was up from the jump
When I passed ma the blunt, the bitch was a steamer
I ain't care I had weed to blow
I ain't feed the hoe, we took a trip to Argentina
I don't know why a guy would pause
I went raw inside the whore, I thought she would be cleaner
Dirty bitch burnt me, that concerned me
Now I'm thirsty, I'm looking for her with the nina
I'ma kill her when I see her
So tell me have you seen her, tell me have you seen her?

[Chorus: Freekey Zekey]
It be the girls with the pretty face and the pretty rides
Pretty thighs, but what about they insides
And that bitch is a liar and dyke
I took the condom off, now it's on fire tonight

It be the girls with the pretty face and the pretty rides
Pretty thighs, but what about they insides
And that bitch is a liar and dyke
I took the condom off, now it's on fire tonight

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Yo, it's like treat her like a prostitute (prostitute)
Don't treat no girly good, don't ever show her ya loot
Girly see you riding wanna roll in the Coupe
See you a ice cream want you to throw her a scoop
I don't get mad tell her to blow on my flute (suck a dick, bitch)
Before the I-E, you gotta throw in the group, groupie
Sad I read it, woo wee I'm glad you deaded
Sue me, what, you mad I said it
Put front, back, side to side
Never let a broke ass female ride
I learnt that down South, niggas in Texas
Before I trick, I buy bigger baguetteses
Imagine me get her baguetteses, get her a Lexus (not me)
You figuring reckless, baby I'm sexist
So back up, let me strap up
Before you give Cam that clap up, I'm gon' have to clack up

[Interlude: Freekey Zekey talking]

[Chorus: Freekey Zekey]
It be the girls with the pretty face and the pretty rides
Pretty thighs, but what about they insides
And that bitch is a liar and dyke
I took the condom off, now it's on fire tonight

It be the girls with the pretty face and the pretty rides
Pretty thighs, but what about they insides
And that bitch is a liar and dyke
I took the condom off, now it's on fire tonight
