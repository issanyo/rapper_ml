[Intro]
Turn the uhh, track up player
It's that real west coast shit, man
What the fuck you thought it was

[Chorus]
Plastic surgery
Call 9-1-1 emergency
Breast implants and saline shots and steroid fix with a little botox
Plastic surgery
Call 9-1-1 emergency
Enhancement drugs these fake ass thugs
You ain't no G's, these niggas need
Plastic surgery

[Verse 1: Mr. Short Khop]
Still does it for the rags and lo-lo's
Set the game for the fags and the homos
But it back in they ass no K-Y
I'mma keep it G, you will keep it G-A-Y
Screen smokey these niggas phoney
They Oscar Mayer weiners bologna
Pulling all the soldiers out
Nigga its a dirty game
I just took my rollers out
And I let my shirley's hang
Same thing for the 5-0-1's right or wrong
Nigga's bugging the babylon
{vision vicious of time begun}
Know I gots mine not far from me
The A.R. next to me
In a car next to me
Made it clear group on niggas if that 40 heat cock
Round real rooster niggas giving hoes peacock
They done, done it, keep it 100
Most of these rap niggas really don't cut it
And most these niggas is bitches too
And most of them niggas look just like you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Kokane]
I bet your favorite sport is hockey
Cause nigga you pull a check
I'm king like James where they're secretly sucking dick
Niggas wearing man purses, looking like Ru'paul
Hands tighter than Pee -wee Herman
I don't fuck wit' none of y'all
She used to have nassatall with tig ol bitties
But when I seen her last week she had ass and titties
Reality star hoe's thinking they look good
But you insecure bitches run around Hollywood
I'm a grinder, hustler
On my paper chase
Getting ugly out here like Lil' Kim's face
Nigga hide your son
Nigga hide your daughter
Sharks in the ocean swimming in shallow water
Nigga, I hold my own in the buddy boy zone
I'm sitting on the throne, while these niggas in the twilight zone
West coast niggas, you know what's happening
I call fake ass niggas like livlng with the Kardashian's
Eewww

[Chorus]
