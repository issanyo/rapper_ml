[Intro]
Ha
Yea
Something for the radios
And all the, all the lo-lo's
You know what I'm saying
Mr. Kane and Tray Deee
From Pomona to the L.B.C
Goin down
Check it out

[Chorus: Kokane & Tray Deee]
I used to live the killer tracks
And I'm from 21st street
House parties
Everbody brung heat
Dope dealers
All in the porch
Now we some killers
And blastin' on marks
No scrilla
Cause they get touched
And can you feel us
We kickin' up dust
We cap peelers
And don't give a fuck
Breakout fool before you get bum-rushed

[Verse 1: Kokane]
Twiddly dee dumb, ghetto star
I treat a trick bad like a base-head card
Fool I ain't gonna get rich
While listening to them suckers
Cause if your pussy'd a indo blunt
I'd be high like a motherfucker
Now it's a Pomona thing
Got no B.C. thing
Let my nuts hang
Let me bang
Let me bang
On the first day of Christmas
My daughter gave to me
A .45 and a throwaway, G
I grew up on loud music
Similac and 40 ounce's
Seen fools get killed
Before I could count
So ain't nothing Hollywood about me, G
I'm straight corn feed
Grew up of government cheese
As with real O.G.'s who can't bounce with these
Is this the dismissal
{christmas list your baby be blue}
{when i dose might hit it zone point}
Like a hollow pointed bullet
I'm like Mr. Clinton
I ain't afraid to pull it
We smoke the bomb sticky dosha'
Lookin' at these studio gangstas
Who gettin' older
Cause the industry is like the dope game
That's why I used to call myself Kokane

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Cause you don't wanna funk with me
You're funking with some real O.G
From Pomona to the L.B.C
It's the Kane and the homie Tray Deee
Say, do you wanna bang with me
You're funking with some real O.G
From Pomona to the L.B.C
It's the Kane and the homie Tray Deee

[Verse 2: Tray Deee]
We bust caps and ruff raps
Till the opponents collapse
Tray and Kane make it bang
Ain't you knowin' the haps
This ain't know puzzle
We out there bubble like champagne
Serving perpetraitors in and out this rap game
From the city with no pity
The corners of Pomona
I roll with only killers and my niggas
No baloney(bologna)
Out for getting over
Whatever get the chedder
The debt is on whoever
Not toghether with the [?], (bust that fool)
We above and money set and respect
No hesitation, or second thinking
Cause we living like some gangstas
Up against the odds, it's a job to win
Where niggas steady tryna stop you oxygen
So I keep me some heat ignition, straight up
As soon as it's beef fools get ate up
Cause it's the west side
Where the best die for less
And niggas don't mind putting life's to rest

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
