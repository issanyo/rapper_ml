[Intro: Roscoe]
Say to the whole world
I got the cocaine okay?
Yeah, I got the cocaine man
I got the yay, Y.A
Scoe Montana
Scodie Montana (Desoto)
I got the cocaine man (remember my name)

[Kokane]
Oh heavens to megatron, ooooooh
You have about three seconds to do this, ooooooh

[Chorus: Kokane]
I'm just a ballin' ass niggaro, you best to get ready
Straight out the penitentiary, to makin' all this fetti
We gangsta rock steady, bang this in your Chevy
We pushin' weight heavy, even if they won't let me

[Roscoe]
Scoe is chillin', makin' a million
Stackin' this loot 'til I touch top ceilin'
Miraculous, toothless, with top notch women
Acura roofless, blastin' my music
Adelle on my right, he done got me for my light
I'm a Star like Tri
Crazy youngster livin' a hard knock life like Jay the hustla
I'm a professional mic clutcher plus a dope rhymer
Ghetto poet with perfect timin', I'm an opportunist
Takin' advantage of my youth, fresh when I do it
The homie Kokane, tighter than choker chains
Soakin' the game up with dreams of Roscoe's name bein' a household name
We ballin', ghetto fabulous
Just tryin' to do my thang in this cold game, switchin' four lanes

[Chorus: Kokane]
I'm just a ballin' ass niggaro, you best to get ready
Straight out the penitentiary, to makin' all this fetti
We gangsta rock steady, bang this in your Chevy
We pushin' weight heavy, how much you wanna bet me?

[Roscoe]
Scoe is chillin', lyrical villian
Straight up outta Philly, West Coast feel me
I pack mack millies, dash with Daz Dilly
Dippin' through L.A. where it don't get chilly
I got a attic where I stash my scrilla
Keep a automatic nina heater by the attic
Homie my gat blast speratic blasts
Latitude accuracy, rappin' fast
(I'm) Young 'Scoe-dizzle, (I'm) keepin' it rizzle
(With) heaters that sizzle, me and young Bizzle
Hit the cypher up and stand in the middle
Puttin' MC's in the Rap Hospital
Hospitable, Roscizoe, my flizow not spitable
My dizoe not get-able
Everything digital, un-F-witable
We incredible and that's inevitable

[Chorus: Kokane]
I'm just a ballin ass niggaro, you best to get ready
Straight out the penitentiary, to makin' all this fetti
We gangsta rock steady, y'all niggas ain't ready
Bang this in your Chevy, we pushin' weight heavy

[Roscoe]
D.P., D.P., D.P.G. - (X 4)

Scoe is gettin' in where I fit in
Spittin' bad rubbish, keep it thuggin', keep livin'
Keep givin' all I got, takin' what I want
Breakin' down the sacks and crackin' open a blunt
Crack the window to get some fresh oxygen
This little Porche we hot boxin' in
I'm a G to the game, low-key in the game
I got the key to the game, D.P.G. is the gang

[Chorus: Kokane]
I'm just a ballin' ass niggaro, you best to get ready
Straight out the penitentiary, to makin' all this fetti
We gangsta rock steady, bang this in your Chevy
We pushin' weight heavy, how much you wanna bet me?

[Roscoe]
D.P., D.P., D.P.G. - (X 4)

[Kokane talking]
Oh, what you say?
Heavens to megatron
We still bangin' in space, the new generation
Ooooooh
Kokane!, Roscoe, Roscoe, Roscoe
Kokane, Kokane, no brain
