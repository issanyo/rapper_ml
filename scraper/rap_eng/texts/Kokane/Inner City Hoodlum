[Intro]
Once upon a time
In the land of booze bitches and paybacks
Live to cut throat pimping motherfuckers
1 motherfucker named fast black
And another inky black motherfucker named smart dog
Now what these 2 nickel slicked niggas had in common
Was that they could run game on motherfuckers
Like it want nothing but a thang'
Ya' see
What fast black was
He was a thieving motherfucker
I mean the nigga was so good
He could still stink outta shit if he wanted too
But ya see on the other hand
Smart dog had more of the players hustlers touch
If ya know what i mean
Now how these 2 motherfucker operated
I mean the shit that fast black use to take
He gone give to the nigga named smart dog
The pimps the ho's the whole 9 yards
On the street
Ya know what am saying
The hustling shit
Now these 2 innercity hoodlums
Gonna tell a little story like this
And they gonna maintain a level of
Status of balling
To complete what they have to do underground
And these motherfuckers gonna go like this


[Verse 1] Koke
Now this is not a ticket to the colour of skin
Only giving you a view of how i make my ends
I'd like to introduce myself, my name is fast-black
Welcome to the world of booze, bitches and paybacks
From the land down under
Fast-black is the man to strike ya ass like thunder
So i procede to be a nigga that'll take your shit
A number 1 player thats out for the big hit
And if ya flaunt that grip
I think you'll last pop up like jack in a box
And smoke that ass
Suprise, suprise
I bet you think im trippin
Im taking all your goods
Cause i finally caught you slipping
Tip toed in the hood to my homie to get paid
Cause my alluring posture was kinda of big
Well what do you do
I persist to use my street bid
Cause i'm what is known as a
Inner city hoodlum

[Sample]
Playing' motherfucker and i'm in demand

Sshow you right
Now fast black was known for handling things
I mean that nigga was a blast from the past
Give you a mega dose of insulin
To give you a funky reaction
But on the other hand
On the other side of the b side that is
Was a sly ass nigga
That had to make mo' money
Now he gone go into detail
To let you know how he fit


[Verse 2] 187um
See i'm like robin hood but with a different twist
Cause i take from the suckers and i sell it to get rich
I can do this shit smoother than a eye can believe
You can call it a feeling or an instinct
Yo dog
What's up
How you'd keep them hoe's in line
Well the key to pimping is to control a woman's mind
But you know, it still ain't understood
See i pick em' well, i pick em' young, i pick em' good
Ok, so how you setting up in all actuality
Hmm, i have to say i have a players mentality
Cause i slide to the side with the gangster glide
Keep my game down packed
So i stack and stay alive
Move on
I do em' quite bold
Because the key to hustling
Is to make a fat bank roll
Fast
Faster than you can run
Yea faster than the brother that broke
When i shot my gun
Cause its a everyday cycle for me
To spend 1 doller and make 3

[Sample]
Playing' motherfucker and i'm in demand

Ohh yeah
Now sweet talk must confess
Yes sweet talk must confess
These niggas had it some what going on
They had everthing set up
From north, east, south, west
Every cross the U.S motherfucking A
But they felt unsatisfied
So they had to get into a jack move
And they gonna tell you a little underground story like this
Check it out ya'll


[Verse 3]
Yo dog
Whats up
I see ya chilling
Oh yeah
I'm looking in the players
Choice to get damaged
Why is that black
Do you have some type of fear
Hell no im just reading about the hustler of the year
Tell me black
Whats up
Yea, whats the fools name
Some fool named winnie bragging about his fame
From the looks of the nigga he really ain't shit
Ya thinking what im thinking
Yea lets jack this nigga quick
2 loc'd out nigga incognito
Hella disguises and were swooping in a fucked up regal
Got to the spot with no delay
Parked down the street so we can make a smooth getaway
Yo black
A-ha
Yea, since this is ya feel
Go up to the house and show these fuckers the deal
I gotta better idea
Whats up
I need ya help im busy, a-ha
2 guards around the front and back
You know we got a certain
Cause you take the front gate
And you take the back gate
Kill em' all and take they're shit
Then we make a break
Yea, took out the fool from the back
Yea, then i took out the fools from the front
But before i could say don't move
1 of his boys drew
I had to smoke his ass just like a blunt
In the house is 3 hoes, 5 ki's
And a fool named winnie down on his knees
Like a rat eating cheese
Saying please don't smoke me
I'll give you what you need
Money, hoes even hook you up on weed

I ain't gonna smoke you homie
Dont worry about it
Yo god, smoke this fucking fool
Al'right

Now what about the hoe's should i shoot them
Nah, i'll think they'll enjoy working for inner city hoodlum's
