[Intro]
K-O-K-A-N-E, K-O-K-A-N-E and S-P-I-I-I
It's my nigga yayo
Kokane bitch, bloooow
Haha, yo partner Speezy
Speezy, weezy
You know
From the Bay to Pomona
Ya know Killa-fornia

Uh
My name is  someone
Some people call you
Lethal one?
My name is the one
Some people call you once

[Verse 1]
I said a clip(clip) Glock(Glock)
A uzi automatic
Some static around the corner
Niggas busting out the hoopty going, blooow nigga
Upt' jumped the Chevy
And the nigga straight belled up out
I said a 1 to the 2, a 2 to 2-3
Took a test to be a motherfucking G
And all the real niggas came amazed at me
The natural born killa S-P-I-C-E
Got A.K stash for the spot in the benz
Watching all my enemies and all my friends
I keep a killa on the pay roll, they know
When its time to handle business nigga lay-low
Hold the nigga for ransom make his family pay
When the shit is all over dump 'em up in the bay
Spice 1, love Bossalini
Straight thug nigga
I only fuck with them criminals and drug dealers
I walk the earth for one reason
What's that
To regulate my chips, bust bars throughout four seasons
Easing down the road with my nigga Kokane
Niggas get slugs for the dome when they cross the game

[Chorus]
Penal code section 11-3-5-0
In possession of cocaine
And the east bay gangsta (Spice 1)
We doing this
I represent Pomona from the O'
We doing it, doing it

[Verse 2]
I love that ghetto shit strictly ignorant shit
The kinda hanging out yo window
Eating chicken out yo caddy shit
We write the songs to make you kill fools
Smash suckers
Call me captain save a clucker
We not just rappers we dope dealers
Ignorant motherfuckers straight cap peelers
It's like bass, how low can you go
Enough to move my yay' across San Di-yayo
Who the fuck wanna step up and battle Kokane
Peruvian flows straight laced with dope man'e
I'm more doper than the C.I.A supplied Los Angeles
Uhh, Bitch can't handle this
I'm more realer than 10 niggas getting killed upon the daily
More realer than a pregnant woman
Coming to the crack spot with 4 babies
Man it's getting shady
Can't even drop my kids off to school without packing my .380 (three-eighty)
Broken house
Seperated spouses
Pitbulls up in the back
Same plastic upon the couches
Niggas playing domino's
Smoking weed, shooting craps, slinging crack
Thinking about the days of way back

So step right up and get your cavi
Before the drug begins
Tell all your friends
We got them chickens ya dieing dough fly?
Ya got 36 more to see/sing
Oh, yeah

Uh,yeah
Gorillapimpin
Why you niggas be simping
Spice 1 and Kokane
Making this shit for you niggas that be blooding and cripping
Oh yeah


[Chorus]
Penal code section 11-3-5-0
In possession of cocaine
It's the east bay gangsta
Ohh and we doing it/this
I/we represent pomona from/to the O'
We doing it/this, doing it/this
