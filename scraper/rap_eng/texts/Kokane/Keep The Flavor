[Intro]
Let's drop it
U.S.C. is underground, underground, underground
A lawhouse production
U.S.C. is underground, underground, underground
A ruthless production

[Verse 1]
You see I don't drop to rap like no other
Not against the peace sign, brother
Always keep 'em on minimal pay
So that way I can be one step of the rat race
Ruthless is an organization
Built up a different talent occupation
Dre is the man with the hype that samples
But let me progress to a list of hard examples
MC Ren is the villain
Ya fuck with the nigga in black
Time for a killing
Michel'le is so nicety
Tearing up other competion that's blimey
Yella, Yella is getting busy
I said he fucking up the drums like Sheila E
I said the D.O.C he's a stylist
He has the whole funk
And nothing but the funk
You know the nigga's gettin' funky enough
I said the bitches quake
When they hear a nigga vocal tone
Give it up for the one named Mike Holmes
Yo Dre now full time [?]
[?] touche O'Shea
And bring on the hip-hop thugsta
Named Eazy-E
The ladies they love ya
J. J. Fad had a double platinum hit
So other bitches can't really talk shit
That's how it is
We hit ya and we daze ya
Longevity is mine
Cause we keep the flavor

[Sample Chorus]
Flavor, Flavor

[Verse 2]
Of thee a sing so I can bring
Attention to a suburban area
Ya see statistically
They wanna stop hip hop
Because it evolves around a ghetto aterea
Cause we got people like KM.G
So people get mad cause knowledge most greatly
As we hear the juice
Hit the various black?
Eating chicken like a motherfucker
Rolling his cadillac
Go Mack with the sack
Cutting up the mix cause he can't hold back
Balling that brother when he step in the joint
And write some hype ass shit
With a black on black ball point
Can't forget my man Total K-Oss
His housing the motherfucking place
If a sucker get ill ya best believe
He will erase ya face
But just in case ya try to face
And sneak behind a brother with dope'ness
Then you better watch out 187's in progress
Coming at you with the way out style
Producing and lyrical killing top billin'
Top selecta' everybody must go
I'm cutting up ya sucka's everyday in the snow
Down ass boy dat's ya in da floor
I'm fuckin up you bitches
And her name is kilo
Lay-law with the motherfucking clout
Next year I be taking the law-house rout
That's how it is
We hit ya and we daze ya
Longevity is mine
Cause we keep the flavor

[Sample Chorus]
Flavor, Flavor
Keep the flavor

[Bridge]
Here's the directions
Before engaging into any bias music activities
You must first shut the fuck up
And let the people from Ruthless take
It's toll on your dumb ass
Caution use wisely before using this product
You get the picture
Now kick it like this

[Verse 3]
Aww shucks ain't that a pity
You in the L.A row? that's prodominatly black
In the city of a thousand reasons
And everybody out there wanna
Throw the exact copy
Of a sound that down underground
That we got top notch albums like
Straight Outta Compton
We Want Eazy then it's time to get funky
Or break into a dope ass Formula
For the rest of the generic labels
I never heard of ya
Nicety or No More Lies
Fuck The Police Parental Discretion Iz Advised
Untouchable is a dope track
But let me go back
Cause now I got a Murder Rap
We're taking over the 90s cause we're up on it
So I guess I gotta chill cause I'm feeling Supersonic
There it is gotta get into your skin
An then I'll really be ranching
So there it is
We hit ya and we daze ya
Longevity is mine
Cause we keep the flavor

[Sample Chorus]
Flavor, Flavor
Keep the flavor
U.S.C. is underground, underground, underground
A lawhouse production
U.S.C. is underground, underground, underground
A lawhouse production
