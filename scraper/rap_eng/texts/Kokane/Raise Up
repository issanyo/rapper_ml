You know what, I'm sayin'

[* Crows crowing *]

Ooh ooh, uh huh, ooh ooh
Doghouse Family, check it out

Buckle up, put cho' chin strap on
If you fucks with mine it's on
I don't know if you've been told
But if you fuck with Doghouse it's on
Ya gotta raise up, ya gotta get up
Bitch ass niggas, ya gotta raise up
If ya wanna get down, ya gotta get up
Bitch ass niggas, ya gotta raise up
If ya wanna get down, ya gotta get up
Fake ass niggas, ya gotta raise up
If ya wanna get down, ya gotta get up

[Verse 1]
I'm a crazy motherfucker from the streets
Ridin' in my Caddy, leanin' to the side
Eatin' deep fried pickled pigs feet
Fight lotion, I keep my lips hemmed and ashy
Buckle on beads so my shit stay nappy
Kokane you need to wash your ass
Been scratchin' my dick for a year, just found out I had crabs
You's a nasty ass negro
Yeah but I love kickin' it with them Doghouse niggas makin' them pesos
I'm a bad role model, my name is Kokane
Next it seems like I'm the worses name in the game
You won't wanna remember life is kind of scary
Sittin' alone in the dark, yellin' out bloody mary
I was born in a dark room
Pulled out a 4-5 on the doctor when I came out the womb
I said mom I wanna suck the nurses titties, cause her shit is bigger
You dirty little nigga, ah ha ha ha ha ha

[Hook]
Ya gotta raise up, ya gotta get up
Bitch ass niggas, ya gotta raise up
If ya wanna get down, ya gotta get up
Bitch ass niggas, ya gotta raise up
If ya wanna get down, ya gotta get up
Fake ass niggas, ya gotta raise up
If ya wanna get down, ya gotta get up

[Verse 2]
Now this the shit that make you wanna start back bangin' on niggas
Squabbin' on niggas, murderin' niggas
We gangsta with cheese, foolish nothin'
You yellin' peace, nigga we dumpin
About four of these homeboys will be snitchin'
Niggas be tellin like bitches, girls, girls [* Whistle *]
What's up cuz
Tired of these motherfucking fake homies snitchin' to the fuzz
Nigga I'm burnt out, got turned out at an early age
Nigga flip the page
At twelve is when I first got some pussy
When I let some sixteen year old suck my weenie
I ain't got no front teeth in my mouth so I say f-words with a p
Like puck you and plow down with me
Beat yo motherpucking ass puck all y'all
Doghouse niggas gon' continue to ball
Fuckin' with us is like bad health
Doghouse niggas make ya shit on yourselves, nigga

What, they still talkin' shit
So what chu' in a half-way house nigga
We still gon' ride

[Hook]

Buckle up, put cho' chin strap on
If you fucks with mine it's on
I don't know if you've been told
But if you fuck with Dogghouse it's on
