[Intro: Kokane]
Eazy-muthaphukkin-E
I mean, how can I descibe this nigga
I mean, that nigga was a genius
Muthaphukkin godfather of gangsta rap
Open up a can of words to all you ryders
You know what I'm sayin'
So don't hate the nigga
This is dedication to my nigga Eazy-muthaphukkin-E

[Yella]
Yeah, for all the motherfuckers out there
That weren't down with this shit, fuck 'em
Fuck you, real niggas, dedicated to my nigga E
You know who's down
Yo Kokane, let's do this shit

[Verse 1: Kokane]
Now this is dedicated to my niggas from around away [all my homies]
I know you wake up every morning think about
When you gonna die some day, some day [ya' know we all gotta go]
Lord I feel so bad for all the wrong I've done [forgive me]
And I still can't believe my nigga E is just dead and gone, gone
Now Eazy-duz-it, duz it eazy
But some times we don't know the pain
We cause [we cause] no love at all
So thank you Eazy-E for givin' us the gangsta sound
Real men comes make, the world go round

[Hook]
[This is] 4 tha E, a Real Compton City G [Eazy]
[This is] 4 tha E, a Real Compton City G [Real nigga number 1]
[This is] 4 tha E, a Real Compton City G [Eazy]
[This is] 4 tha E, a Real Compton City G [Well, I'm Eazy-E]
[A Real Compton City G]

[Verse 2: Kokane]
Roll up a fat sac of hydro and pass it around
Hypnotized to the muthaphukkin gangsta sound
Now I heard there was a gang of niggas that don't like Eazy
That the motherfuckers janky down right low and dirty
I guess the pen is more quicker than the trigger
Don't be signing 'em contracts
Without reading 'em, nigga
Cause the industry
Is like the dope game
Always business
Never personal main
Yeah, Eazy had some scandalous ass days
But at times we all have muthaphukkin scandalous ways
But stopped for a second, thinked about the situation, G
If there weren't no Eazy, there wouldn't be no B.G.'s and O.G.'s and gangstas expressing the fuck how they feel, what they desire
He opened up a can of worms to all ryders, the true ryders
And that's real

[Hook]
[This is] 4 tha E, a Real Compton City G [Eazy]
[This is] 4 tha E, a Real Compton City G [Real nigga number 1]
[This is] 4 tha E, a Real Compton City G [Eazy]
[This is] 4 tha E, a Real Compton City G [Well, I'm Eazy-E]
[A Real Compton City G]

[Outro: Kokane]
So this is dedicated, to my nigga E
A straight gangsta gangsta, hard as from the C-P-T
But what goes up must come down
It's sad that E ain't around
I'm glad to have the chance to know Eazy real nigga number one O.G
Won't you rest in peeeeeeeeeeace

[Yella]
Yeah, my nigga
A True nigga
A C-P-T muthaphukka
The real streets got ya back
'96 style
We Still in this muthaphukka
Thinkin' about you, nigga
Always
Always
Love ya
Miss ya
R.I.P. E
