[Intro]
Elliot beeswax
Alcaphunk
No artificial flavors
Alias b maximus
A/K/A no additive preservatives
So get out my funk
Get of my funk
I'd watch out
For this is the season
Of the Chrome syndrome

[Verse 1]
Quite nonchalantly, my name is Kokane
I got the nickel sack of that potent rap crap
Almighty Jah, thank you for the buddha
But if you know this corp? doin coke
Then I suggest that you can
Rolla-rolla feds on upon you know
Yo, my name is Kokane not Adee Do
So overfill an piss a funkaholic in my kizup?
You wanna see me vomit, or should I say throw up
Throw up style, never hold a damn thing back
I just had to re-up, and now I got the fat sacks
It's like 'Tini and Rossi, but don't mix
Bend over bitch and I'mma stick it with the quickness
A-ha, a-ha, you got the right one, baby
Say Mr. stucky lucky but I really don't wanna maybe
But baby, but baby, don't mean no harmin'
So I just skip to the lou, skip to the lou
Skip to the lou my darling

[Chorus 4X]
Now I bet you got mo' water upstairs
Than you got sugar on a candy cane

Where'd you get your funk from? (Repeat)

[Verse 2]
Now I come from the West, Cali-funk-i-a
You say, 'Let me borrow this style
We gotta pay you back on Tuesday'
You look like a base-head, see
'Cause my style is the cavi, so try another cookie
Yo, I think that East battle West is like dumb
And play my fuckin' video
It don't matter what coast I come from
Three-wheel wicked, Chevy Impala
It's time to pick up a honey dip
And rent a room at the Ramada
After flauntin' my words I leave crush
Took of the gears and time to have sex
I'm all in them skins like bam bam
So won't you play like Red Hot Chili Peppers and
Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
She said 'Death do us part?', I said 'Whatever'
Know I'm all in them p-u double crooked letters
There's a lot of MC who need to get smoked, fool
'Cause you got a gang of baking soda in ya dope
Talkin' 'bout you did drive-bys out your Regal
Kill a thousand niggas on one maxi-single
No, nope, not, not, the style don't fit
And you swear that your motherfuckin' ass is the shit

[Chorus]
