[Intro]
Ay' Koka' homie
It don't matter how much work you put into this shit homie
Ya' know
There's gonna be some motherfuckers who don't
Don't respect that shit, G
You know what I mean
Niggas think this shit came easy homie, ya know
Real nigga testimony
Yea-yea' hear that

[Chorus]
You can go hard
You can go home
You can give up, give up
When things go wrong
But I put in work
I paid my dues
Sometimes you win
Sometimes you lose
But what {though?} killer real nigga
{will may control?}
As times keep moving on

[Verse 1: Kokane]
If I can identify around pain
I'll paint a ugly picture
But out of this ugly picture
Come victory, nigga
Now what's Popeye the sailor man
Without Brutus
What is Jesus Christ
Without that nigga named Judas
Where would a nigga be without this pain
The type of pain that'll make you blow your brain like Cobain
If it had not been for the man up stairs
I would be dead or in jail, looped out somewhere
Cause I come from a long list of gangstas and macks
And most blacks in the hood got a uncle who smoke crack
Look back at time shake my head ain't that something
Realizing that without God, homie, we nothing
It took a long time for my eyes to be open
But better late than never nothing changed but the weather
I learned a valuable lesson
As quickly as you get blessed
You can loose your blessing

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Kokane]
Now I remember when I used to be the life of the party
Pay the tab at the bar
Drinks for everybody
Niggas that I thought used to be my brothers
But when I lost it all
Started showing their true colors
It went from celebrating a nigga
To putting salt on my name
All these M.C's I bless in this shady rap game
Felt humiliated, busted and disgusted
The whole world's laughing at me
Niggas I trusted
But the same thing satan designed to kill me
Is the same thing God use for a nigga victory
Rose out of the ashes
Putting paint where it ain't
Got the family on deck
10 fold in the bank
Couldn't thank you scandalous niggas enough
Seems odd
Because of your wicked ways
Brought me closer to god
Cause these rap niggas in the game some weirdos
Plucking their eyebrows, painting a nigga toes
I use to like Boy George records
But real niggas don't wear no dresses
The game is so vicious
Niggas take it up the ass to get illuminati rich
Some niggas pay dues and some niggas don't
The lord is my shepherd and I shall not want
He restore my soul
For his name sake
And yike
Do I walk through the valley of the fake

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mitchy Slick]
Big wopp from Inglewood try to tell me first
He said Slick hope your ready rappers get it worst
When I was just damu'ing it was all church
But ever since recognition
I'd a felt cursed
When I was a crash test dummy
They all love me
But once the cash got chunky
Someone's life fucked me
Cali gangbanging rules need to be adjusted
The guidelines ain't in favour of the homies bumping
They don't understand the industry
You can be struggling
Just because a nigga got a deal
Don't mean he check busting
You got a 360 deal, you hungry still
Suppose to be on tour
Nigga I'm {o.t?} with pills
I get the chills when I think of how it could of ended
On the 4 yard with all my luxuries suspended
Cause of some shit a nigga that suppose to be my friend did
Free all the homies who didn't get the memo i did
Trill

[Chorus]

[Outro]
As time keeps moving on
A real nigga gotta stay strong
Wooh, wooh, woo, woo, woo
