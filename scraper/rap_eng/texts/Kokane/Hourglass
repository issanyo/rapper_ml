[Goldie Loc]
I slap bitches in the face and give em Jay-Z lips
Make them sign their life off so they can pay me chips
I cut hoes so much I should sell band aids
Give bitches sandwiches with handmade mayonnaise
I put bitches on the stroll hall
Plus I control hoes like remote control suped remote controlled cars
Code blow ho on 'em like the internet
Got my dick in her neck and ain't even took her to dinner yet
Fuck that I ain't taken her to dinner
I'll bring her to a diner get behind and go up in her
You fuckin' with losers

'Bout to slap your ass off the endo smoke
I'm in the club straight goin' for broke
Sellin' bitches everything even low key dope

[Kokane]
Don't you wanna get nasty
I like it when you freak that ass

You be doin' the worm in the club
Like a chicken with it's head cut off
Let me rub up on that clit it feels so nice and soft

[Snoop Dogg]
Coast to coast we do-si-dos
And get your day started like a breakfast toast
Me and my niggas make beats for your strokes
Heat for your tokes, baby tees for your chokes, keys for your ?
Me squeezin' your folks

With their noses flarin' out like they be on that coke
Nah we on that dope
Now she wanna go cause she wanna know
How did we walk through the front door
No pat down, Straight V.I.P
Well when it comes to rap styles, and rap crowns, and mack downs
Just mingle, we straight smack down

If you with it you can have a little hit off me
Get nasty, get freaky, get busy o-so-off the hizzy
