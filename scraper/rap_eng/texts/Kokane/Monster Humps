[Intro]
Welcome we have been expecting you
*laughing*

Natural Disasters
Kokane
What you wanna do, nigga

[Verse 1: Natural Disasters]
Now I only got a dub
But I'm rolling on some chrome in the '98, bud
Windows tinted
Fresh air sented
Nice gold trim with some super bumps in it
Haters hit the floor quick
Cause they jealous and they only full of rolleders? shit
Like some bomb pass it once
And you cough cause it's hard to control this shit
Now I'm back on my feet
Hear the homies calling shotgun
Windows lefts and right seats
But I ain't got the air to burn
I'm the nigga behind the wheel
When it's time to turn
Lean to the left
Watch your knees I'm about to lay back
To floss on the bitches
That I knew from way back
Go half for what I got
Store it straight in the tank
That don't mean we can't play big bank take little bank

[Chorus]
Now I roll with a crew that ain't afraid to funk
It's the niggas coming through with the monster humps
Ahh-haa
And you don't wanna fuck with me
We're chillin' like this smokin' bomb ass weed
It's the California lifestyle that you need
Ahh-haa
(ain't nothing like the real thing)
You don't wanna fuck with me

I only got a dub
But I'm rolling on some chrome in the '98, bud
And I'm the nigga with the bud
Plus
Rolling shotgun with the .38 slug
I only got a dub
But I'm rolling on some chrome in the '98, bud
Rolling shotgun with the .38 slug

[Verse 2: Kokane]
Reminiscing on some gangsta tales
As I roll up a fatty
Eating chicken like a motherfucker, rolling my Caddy
I said I sag so low
You can see the shit stains in my drawers
Drinking a 40 holding my balls
Saying yes yes ya'll
The party don't stop all night long
I make the gangsta shit that make ya C-walk on
Fuck it, nigga, what you know about the S-I
Real you don't die nigga we multiply nigga
Miami Cubans use to have hook ups on that ya'
But nowadays they ain't fucking with the Ese
The caliente
What seeds? I know they smoke that bomb ass weed
It's the California lifestyle that you need
I sit alone in my room and I'm starin' at candles
Everyday trying to get a handle
On this California game
California change get ya caught up
Fucking with these nigga's man'e

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Natural Disasters]
Mamma said there be days like this
So I never trust a bitch
I learn the game and get rich
Nigga's throw curve balls
While I swing at their pitch
Dust they ass of and throw 'em in a ditch
Riding coffin? a fresh Monte Carlo
On gold one's with the shoe laces
Ain't nobody trippin' just paper chasing
Why you bitch niggas keep player hating
I'm taking my time concentrate on the future
And money banking lucifer got me on one
Roots of all evil benjamin ? of the world
I'm trying to get a piece god forgive me
Keep my family give my hands?
For when I die I don't wanna be no broke man
It's getting hot I'm slowly losing my cool
Way crazy 5150 acting a fool
It's hard to get to town? these days
Wake up at 9 o'clock get drunk as fuck
And think of ways to get paid

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Can I can I get a ride
