[Kokane]
People are so, so greedy
Tired of fake homies, homies, homies
(Why they hatin' on me)
I don't know what...
(Y'all expect from me)
In fact I'm tired of...
(So-called fake homies)
You reall ain't said nothin'
Only come around...
Act like I owe ya something

[Hook: Kokane]
(GREED)
What make lifetime groups break up (GREED)
Oh, what make yo woman take yo cash and don't give a fuck (GREED)
Destroys successful record companies (GREED)
And put chu' in yo grave and you rest in hell

[Sen Dogg]
It's a motherfucker man, they all greedy
You get cho' head put out for shit that you don't need
Some fools baller status just ain't enough
There's always some other nigga out there that got it mo' plush
You don't gotta be a rich man to be content
Some niggas got it all but don't know where the good times went
The quality of life can only be enhanced
When ya trust other motherfuckers and uh give em' a chance
Don't mistake my kindness as a weakness
Cause I work out my mental as well as my physical fitness
I've seen a lot of fools get caught up in this greed business
All it gets you is on everybody's shit list
Greed is like a disease, something sort of psychologic
Once ya take the gun ho ain't no way to ever stop it

[B-Real]
How many faces of greed have you seen
That would make a good man fall and a woman plot and scheme
Even a homie on ya team is suspect
When it comes to money and power an all you expect
They try to put their hands in ya pockets with out chu' lookin'
But when I find you out ya whole world's shookin'
And they're relentless, the quest for the ends is endless
You lose yo senses and you get beatin' senseless
But there's others you can't do nothin' about
Cause they're on a higher level and they hold too much clout
But in time, in the end they'll pay
When they're standin' before the man on Judgement Day
Standin' there but what excuse can you give
You reduced to shit because you refuse to give
