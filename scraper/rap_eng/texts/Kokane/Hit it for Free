Uh, the biggest thing between a nigga that spend money
And a nigga who don't
Is a million miles of what..
Fuckin' wit nothing but the bosses BITCH
We don't pay for no muthafuckin' pussy
Ow...

This lil bread I had to scratch to get
That's why I use my mouthpiece and mack to hit
Cause I'd rather relax and sit back
And watch a nasty flick
And jack my dick
Before I spend cash to hit

Mannnn, I used to stressed for bread
Dead broke, jacking off thinking about big bucks and
Baggettes in bed
I've been a crook, I done took paychecks and fled
Three things I hate: HOES, rednecks and feds
Had this one beeeetch...she told me
"It's a hundred to hunch and $50 just to touch the head"
Tuhhh...shittin' me!
Girl I can go to Church's and get a cheaper chicken
With bigger breast and legs
I ain't fin to floss checks and stunt
Only time I pay for cat be at chinese resturants
I ain't earn cash on you
I ain't ya pimp
Bad enough I even burnt my ass on you
I ain't a simp
Look rat hoochie
Get back-slapped to Iaboochie
Catch caps from oozie
Catch claps or cooties
I tell a bitch quick
If I had to pay to bust a nut
Man my right hand would be rich

So can I hit it for free?
Let'em know hustlers don't pay for pussy
Can I hit it for free?
Let'em know, you gon' respect this dick when you ride
With me
Can I hit it for free?
Let'em know, you ain't gon' get a got-damn dime
Can I hit it for free?
Let'em know, what's yours in mine....

[Kokane]
Told the ho I could've had a V8
It was so good, but the bloody pussy stank
Oh right like a real boss do
She turned around and said, "Nigga it's gonna cost you"
"Stank ho, do you know who I are
You lucky just to ride in this car
You lucky just to suck this dick
Ungrateful ass bitch
You better be happy that I'm all in this clit"
Just to let you know..
There be a lot of hoes that be ungrateful
But you gon fuck for free on me
No money
You lucky just to ride in this car

[Bridge - over Hook]
Field mob niggas is the craziest
Fuck a ho lay a big nut on her chest
Pull back, put in like that
It ain't never wanna turn back
Field mob niggas is the craziest
Let'em know what's your is mine...

I'll be damn if I'mma give these hoes my fee
I'm like Farakahn being best friends with porky pig
Or like Hillary Clinton dikin' with Lewinsky
Hell nah never I ain't ever
Giving a bitch a penny
Not even if the penny had a hole in it
Cuase you broke hoes, no dough getting
So-siddity that's why I'm so stingy
And I feel my flow isn't for some foot draggin
Gold-diggin, slow ignorant, broke pigoen wit four chillen
To go spend it, gold in it, blow in it
Buyin clothes wit it back and forth to the weed spots
And liquour stores with it
Instead of handling yo business, with your sibling
Home alone hungry wit no groceries
When I can go get me some more 20's another gold
Grillin', Girbaud fitties
So more tennies, just to go with it
Or I can go give it to homeless, at least I know its coming back
Cause I ain't finn to let no ho spend it
