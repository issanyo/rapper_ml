[Intro]
Well alright
Ha, ha
Well alright
All across the U.S.C
Compton monster west
Pomona I.E
Vallejo, what ya say
Sacramento, Fresco, they know
I walked through the shadow of satans
Straight out perpertrators
Well alright
Like federated
But often hated

[Verse 1]
I used to serve them fiends
Before I became a teen
I met the ghetto streets
And I was cold as ice cream
Ghetto orientated so when street music originated
Built like pieces of puzzles complicated
I'm like Fred G. Sanford
This is a big one honey
I'm coming to join ya with some birds and money
That I just jacked from this fool
I see the snitch in his eye
Call me mister Candid Camera
Give a hater suprise
I know some homies big and back being boo
Some G's kick, kack a shake groove
Don't make me act a fool
I'm just a pimped ass fool smoking mega sacks
And we go back like dwarf hats and croaker sacks
What's a studio player that's really soft
It's like the Dayton Wire without the eagle knockoffs
It's like mixing Pop Rocks and 7 Up; it don't mix
Can I give these janky-ass fools a quick fix

[Chorus]
I'm about
Making major papers
You's about
Being a major hater
You busters can't see me though
Game is air tight

It's the world's guinness book of haters
Lets dip under P, for perpertrators

Fool be colder than a roof on 95 hundred
I'll jack your D's and your girl if I want it

It's the world's guinness book of pages
Let's flick under F, for straight out fakers

Cojones be colder than a roof on 95 hundred
I'll jack yo D's and your sack if I want it

[Verse 2]
It's like radio
Sometimes they never play me
Until I went underground
Like Master P
Real O.G.s strictly for the homies in the game
No pain no gain
Just hoping that, Mr. Kane
Penetentiary chances
Ghetto advancements
I click my romeo's three times
But I know I'm not in Kansas
I'm a jack of all trades
Master of 1
And the thing that I mastered
Is making everybody sprung
Many stanky ass record labels
Can eat a fat dizz-nick
Got some white college fool
Criticing my tune
Boy ain't never been down to the ghetto
Where fools slang yayo out of broken down apartments
All of a sudden he's head of the rap department
I slang my tapes out the trunk of my Impala
Well alright
Sell 50000 units make a half a million Dollars
Fool be in my mix like paparazzo
Just because I went from rags to Tini 'n Asti Spumante

So forgive me if I diss your played out crew
Ya shouldn't hate the next player getting theirs
When you can get yours too
I'm not never find the moment
Waiting for the next player to pay my bills
If I can't get my respect I'mma kill at will
And that's real, that's real, that's real

Went from rags to skyscrapers
Major papers equals major haters
Hmm, yeah
What Eazy say
The more problems you make, the more problems you get

[Chorus]
I'm about
Making major paper
Use about
Being a major hater
You busters can't see me though
Game is air tight

It's the world's guinness book of haters
Let's dip under P, for perpertrators

Fool be colder than a roof on 95 hundred
I'll jack yo Z's and your girl if I want it

It's the world's guinness book of haters
Let's flick under F, for straight out fakers

Fool be colder than a roof on 95 hundred
I'll jack yo sack and your D's if I want it

[Outro]
Ya understand that
We act like a payphone? in here
From the land of sunshine and palm trees
Airbreak to shoe
And you don't wanna fuck with me
You don't wanna fuck with me
I must give it up for DJ Silk
Funky tie? up for me
Airbreak to shoe
Woo, woo

Them gangster hits
We got what it takes, yeah
