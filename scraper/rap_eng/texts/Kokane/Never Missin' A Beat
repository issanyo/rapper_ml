[Intro]
From every head and ass
May dollar's flow


Ohhh
Something new for ya
Well alright
Black mafia life
I hear ya, I hear ya
So get it right ya'll
Well alright ya'll
Ha ha ha
I got's to flow it like a poet
Indeed, indeed
At this time I better show it
So how you gonna do it like this like
I'm gonna step to em' like this ya'll

[Verse 1]
People wanna know why im the c-o cold'est
1st thing remember im the motherfucking genius though
I take it style by style blow by blow
Have you ever lost a battle
Nah, thats a motherfucking no, no
Yo, cause I can take you to the darkest corner
Tell your ass lets do this
And drop dogs on ya
Cause I don't play that rat-pack bullshit
So lets go head up
And thats how we can deal with it
Whom so ever think i'm slipping
You should know that
I'm still the same nigga with my hair cut low
Still toss up 40's
Bumping hella of a bitches
Caravan with my homies
Hitting a gang of switchez
Of course the 4-pack is back
With the sizz-nack
To jack motherfuckers who be slipping on the trizz-nacks
Cause ain't a thing
Happening in the industry
Till they listen to the black mafia L-I-F-E
I don't really on dreams or fake funk fantasies
I got scores of hoe's
Far as the eye can see
Now if, if was reality we'd all be in luck
But if was a fifth now i'd be fucked up
Now that's a message from a true black player
Cause I deal with it now
Fuck talking later

[Chorus]
Cause i'm not bragging i'm just about the lagging
You don't wanna fuck with me
I'm not bragging i'm just about the lagging
You don't wanna fuck with me


I hear ya
Now let's seperate the motherfucking men from the boys
Or the boys from the whips
Cause you know we never simp' over hoes, niggas or nothing
Cause you might get bent 1
But you gotta kick it like this ya'll, yeah


Cause to my people 1 time cause they don't stop
And to my posse 2 times cause they never quit
And for the people out there, if you like this
What should I do kmg
Won't you flaunt some old fly shit

[Verse 2]
Now i'm not from the house that jack built
But fool think i'm frontin
Cause the way I flaunt my gift
1 rule in my book is to always stay strapped
The other is to always have my homies watch my back
Cause I remember the days
When I really wasn't paid
Before my 6 bedroom house and my living maid
I use to roll trick dice in the corners with go-mack
When it was me total kaos and the G selling crack
We living fly and it was good and all that
But the ghetto full of cheese
So you know there's many rats
Pimps, thugs, hoodlums
Living, damn a lot of currency flow
Yo there's a bunch of back stabbers
I'm not saying that it's bad or good
I just throw on my colours
And don't kick it in the wrong hood
Now thats a message from a true black player
Cause I deal with it now
Fuck talking later

[Chorus]
Cause i'm not bragging i'm just about the lagging
You don't wanna fuck with me
I'm not bragging i'm just about the lagging
You don't wanna fuck with me

Well alright ya'll
Yo ass has just been ranched by
Black mafia life
Which is know as
Above the motherfucking law, ya'll
But check this out
Ah, you gotta kick something for these motherfucking, ah


And to my people 1 time cause they don't stop
And to my posse 2 times cause they never quit
And for the people out there, if you like this
What should I do kmg
Ah, won't you flaunt some old fly shit

[Verse 3]
Alright peep
Here I, here I, here I go, go again
Because you know that we keep the flavor
From beginning to the end
Yes i'm like a breeze through the motherfucking wind
Because im the c-o-l-d 1 e-i-h-g-y s-e-v-um
Watch me get um' and lick em' and stick em'
All the same time
Step aside while i'm kicking my riz-hymes, G'
Cause i'm a baller and i'm getting much bigger
So please don't be suprised
Because i'm standing behind that trizz nigga
Cause ATL is 1 model
And we didn't find that shit at the beach in a bottle
So peep game as I kick it to you properly
Much respect to the HBC and to lawhouse
The house with out a doubt we turn it out
Blaze the good shit
To do what
To make hits
Yo, now thats enough from a true black player
Cause i'm finished with ya song so i'll see you later

[Chorus]
Cause i'm not bragging i'm just about the lagging
You don't wanna fuck with me
I'm not bragging i'm just about the lagging
You don't wanna fuck with me


[Outro]
Show you right
Check it out
Ya'll motherfucker just been ranched
So check this out
If you ain't invited in my motherfucking house
Get yo ass of my welcome mat
Or you might be wearing cement shoes, ha ha
But check it out
I gotta hand it over to my man kmg
Cause you know sweet talk
Been talking to motherfucking much on this record
But ah, he gone tell you motherfuckers like this
To tell you what it be like from the underground ya'll

ATL never missing a beat
Black mafia life
Every man has his price
How yo gonna jack me
When i'm the jacker
How you gonna try to out mac me
When i'm the mac'er, fool


You don't wanna fuck with me
I'm not bragging im just about the lagging
You don't wanna fuck with me
I'm not bragging just about imagine
You don't wanna fuck with me

Never missing a beat, yeah

ATL the mega pimp clinc, 92'

Never missing a beat, yeah
