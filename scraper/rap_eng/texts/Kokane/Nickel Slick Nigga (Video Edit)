[Verse 1]
The setting
It's a cool breeze day
Word takes place in the city of L.A
I'm 9 years old to be exact
Checkered bell bottoms, brown shirt
With a dusty ol' cap
Goin to the ABC market
Had to get some new biscuits
2 dollars what a bargain
Preceding up the street
While I'm hummin' a tune
The first time I witness
Somebody's tryin' a jack move
If I'm correct it was a El Co'
Tryin' ta jack a '6-4
Brothers tryin ta tip-toe and yo
Pointin at gauges
Tryin' ta take a brother's ya'
He saw what was up
Got out the vehicle and bailed
He just had to run in my direction
But they smoked the players
Now he's next to the sports section
But the player dropped the ya' on the ground
So then I picked it up
Ran down and around The corner, yo
And through a nearby alley
Escaped through a tiny gate

Cause I was nickel slick [x4]

[Verse 2]
Huffin and puffin
But I finally got to the pad
My mother asked where I was
I said
"Yo, I was over Snowy's house
Playin some marbles"
She believed what I said
So I went to my cars
You see I shared rooms with my cousin
That was mentally slow
But he was a big old kid
6"5', 300 pounds or more
Nicknamed 'Big Truck'
Took the sack out my pants
Unravelled the product
Told my cousin we gotta hustle and bustle
To make money back
I make connections
You watch my back
Set up a program
Called the lemonade stand
But I wasn't sellin drinks
I was sellin big bands
And bundles and boulders of dubs, yeah
At this time I was gettin more pub, yo
From this cluck and that cluck
And everybody wanna cluck cluck
But me and Truck
We was in luck
But the spot got hot, police raid
They took Truck to jail
But me I got away, I was nickel slick
Cause I was nickel slick
I was nickel slick
Cause I was nickel slick

[Verse 3]
4 years past, now I'm 13
Bought me a duster
To go undercover
My cousin's jail sentence was almost finished
Now we back in the streets in a mix
In it to win it
Pulling cards, checkin fools
Checkin names down
Now my status was ballin'
Was set to the ground
Other hustlers knew I was doin my best
Cause I was a baller young fly player from the west
Bought a pimped up crib in Pomona
Not far from the city
So that way I can hit corners
Now who would expect
This little juvenile delinquent's
Straight ballin y'all
As they kept on falling for it
It was a smooth operation you see
Cause I had the luck your whole entire family would love me
5 years swoop now I'm 18
I was steadily pimpin Uncle Sam
Involved in the pimp game
At this time I was bustin' funky rhymes
Hook myself up with 87'
Now am gettin mine
Lay Law was in effect and he said "Let's do this"
Gave it up to E
Then I signed with ruthless
But Truck was left on the spot
Hmm, what I'd do
Hooked my cousin up with the crib and effect, not!
Now Truck was livin high, livin schwell
Me, I'm gettin paid for my mega record sales
So there it is, a player comin up quick
I guess I joined a whole organisation
Of players that are nickel slick
I guess I was nickel slick
Cause I was nickel slick
I was nickel slick

[Outro]
Yo Stan, won't cha play something nickel slick from me
Right here
Yeah, aha
Why don't cha swing it up right here?
Aah yeah, wooh
Now get sanctified, aah
I here ya
Yo, I was a player that was nickel slick
