[Prelude]
Any man
Any man here who has something to say
You gonna get a chance to say it
We got people here they gonna listen to you
And they are gonna take your demands
All the way up the line
Yeahh
Sit, sit, sit down, sit
Now you the niggas now
You white boys gonna find out what it feel like
To have the complexion for the connection
Only this time shit be flying in the right direction
I'd smoke your ass right now
For while we negotiating
Sit down
We need your ass
Bullshit
The department doesn't negotiate
That is policy

[Intro]
[KM.G]
Return of the real shit

Mic motherfucking check 1, uh
Mic motherfucking check 2, yeah
Mic motherfucking check 1, uh
Mic motherfucking check 2, uh
Mic motherfucking check 1, check 1, check 2

[Verse 1: Cold 187um]
Now, I'm the type a nigga sportin' dark locs
I'm the type a nigga that was raised around poor folks
Who didn't even really have a thing
Just kickin' back eating fried chicken and collard greens
From a time where every nigga was trippin'
Cause either you was blooodin'
Or either you was crippin'
What's up there over the rainbow
Every nigga wants a rag-top '64
With 4 dumps in the truck
12 batteries
With the monster humps, uh
Turn it up it's like voodoo
And this the type of shit you do a drive by to, uh
It's time to go straight for the grill
Cause too many motherfuckers tryna trip cause of being real
I'm sippin', I'm tipsy
I'm certain to blast
So they can take their fucking comic/comet?
And shove it up they fucking ass
I got an afro for you fucking skinheads
Come in my way, uh
Ya better holla mayday, uh
Cause I'm a motherfucking real nigga, uh
So fuck Adolf Hitler
And your motherfucking swastika
I'm not muslim or a black brother
Just a crazy ass nigga that'll kill you ass like cancer
I got a question I wanna ask you
Have you ever sold dope cause you had to
[KM.G:] No
Or ever watched a junkie shoot up in ya alley
Or ever watched Sally get pimped by her real daddy
I did
I told the cop I don't
But ya'll think [?] cause you watch [?] on HBO
It's like a sucka yo, ya know ya holding
And Mr. Rodgers in my neighborhood is a fucking pervert
Silly serving candy to the kids man
He doing 20 with a kick stand/ kid stan
So return of the motherfucking real shit
While you other motherfuckers play the bitch

[Chorus]
So...
If you come my way I'm gonna have to spray

[Verse 2: KM.G]
See in 9-flow
All we wear is Levi's
Floss a thick white t-shirt
Hustlers put in work
Flame on
I'm thinking about a motherfucking come up move
Pimp hustlers with that ga-ga-gangster groove
Nigga can you fake
When I tell you that the click is mobbin'
Claiming shermite??
Ready for a gun fight
Bam there it is
Put that on my kids
Niggas don't give a fuck, they don't give a fuck
So now I'm kinda rowdy
And all the niggas that was down
I say howdy
Cause you on a list to get tested, soundboy
Take ya last breath
Then I empty two
Then I took ya little stallion to my homie
K-Oss know the real
All my ho niggas know me
I'm a real G
O.G, O.G
Martini and Rossi, Asti Spumante
I think I share it with my crew
Coco know's some ho's
"and the hills of malibu"
I would love to but I gotta make some ends
I see you round
Who come with you and 8 for the low down
So am G'ing
Cooling like am ski'ing
Pimp clinic gang
Rider don't flame?
Unit up
Rolling with the heater
Hoping shit get much deeper

[Chorus]
So...
If you come my way am gonna have to spray
