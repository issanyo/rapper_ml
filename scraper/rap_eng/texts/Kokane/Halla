[Verse 1]
Turn the lights off
Crepping alone
Where them niggas at
Dare' them niggas go
I'm about to let my 4.4 blow
Take 1 of mine i'mma take 3 of yours
Such a vicious cycle in the ghetto
Tryna' get by just a little
My grandma always told me
That a nigga gotta have hustle on the side
Or cease to survive
6 in the morning feds at my door
Bearly had the 10 slip on my clothes
Out the back window ran throught the alley
My nigga picked me up and we skirted to the valley
I'm at the safe house tryna' figure things out
Make me wanna holla, scream and shout
Cause when you in it, to win it
Pushing and pimping
Can be the closest nigga to ya
That be snitching and tell
Hellll...

[Hook]
Make me wanna halla
Way they do my life

[Verse 2]
20-15, yada'da'mean
Little nigga on the corner serving basehead fiends
Only 13 leaning of mean
Mom's on crack, sister hunt for cheese
Forget mickey D's
He rather make G's
Fuck a happy meal when it don't pay the bills
They'd rather spend a trillion dollers
On funding the wars
They'd rather spend a trillion dollers
Than feeding the poor
With no shoes on they feet
Some barely can eat
Product of the environment
The strong eat the weak
In a concrete jungle
And it's hard to survive
What kind of life is that
When ya born to die

[Hook]
Make me wanna halla
Way they do my life

[Verse 3]
I'mma field nigga
Rolling my cutlass
Picking cotton nigga
You in the house like Frederick Douglass
They used to burn nigga's
Feed our baby's to the alligator's
See us hanging in them tree's
Cause of skin colour
And for generations
We had to live in fear
Enough is enough, revolution's here
I take shit on Willie Lynch grave
That cracker did us wrong
Cause nigga's still act like slaves
We were taught like that
Not to love ourselves
While we wait to goto heaven when we living in hell
I'm Marcus Garvey on a harley
Aka Nat Turner with a burner
I'm speaking the truth like sister Sojourner
The public pretenders don't give a fuck about nigga's
They tryna' reach in the quota
To much weight on my shoulders
Private corporations, invest in legislation
No reparation, no education

[Hook]
Make me wanna halla
Way they do my life

[Outro]
Ain't no sunshine where i'm from
Only darkness flows my way
Ain't no sunshine where i'm from
There's got to be a better way
