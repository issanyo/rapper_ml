[Intro]
(aaahhhh)
Oh yeah, read one of these bed time stories
(whats happening baby)
I'm gonna tell you a little story about my life
(thats right)
Mr. Kane, see I once knew this wise old man
People thought he was a fool
Sipping on this thunder chicken
But he sat me down, and he told me boy
He said listen...

[Hook]
He told me that this little world
Ain't really what it seems to be
Take care of your family
Or get left behind
And don't let no one tell you that
You can't fulfil your dreams
Stay real to the game, don't get left behind
Homie, stay on the grind
If you stay straight and forward
Everything will work out fine
He said soldier, stay on the grind
He said don't miss a traitor
Or get left behind

[Interlude]
Uhh, {the world is P baby?}
You do believe in millennium balling
Uh, yes I do believe in it Battlecat
Huh, well alright
We ain't gonna kick a verse on this 1
Game recognize game
You know what i'm saying Mr. Kane
Well alright
We just gone let it ride
We gone flow to this
Kokane on ya brain
It's a damn shame
C'mon, one more time

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Player partner let me holla at ya
Sip this yak and just relax
I'm about to speak and teach on nothing but facts
Crush up a sack with a whole brick
Hugging a gatt, thugging is back
For the little homies who move in their pack
Keeping using them straps
On them bitch made niggas like that
Who wanna roll through and crawl on
And get they ball on
Here player light this weed
Don't worry about nothing
Cause my partner in town
Is three-fifth for a cold pound
Grinding to the sunshine, splittin the cells
We ain't gone worry about one-time
Lets get our mail
Paper chasing in the fast lane
Escaping the drama
Hit a lick, bought some shit, slid some chips to mamma
In a ordinary fashion, flashing, mashing for paper
In the mist of money makers, player-haters and fakers
Take care of your family first
And god do the rest
Business as usual, nothing more, nothing less

[Hook]
Homie, stay on the grind
If you stay straight and forward
Everything will work out fine
He said soldier, stay on the grind
He said don't miss a traitor
Or get left behind

[Verse 2]
Life got a way
Of slapping you in the face
From a innocent child
To catching your first case
Most black folks go to jail
Before they ever see college
Most homies in the pen
Acquired a gang of knowledge
Jails are pumping up
Lights, TECs and Glocks
From the L.A. county
To the outskirts of Watts
Living in poverty
Ain't a damn thing funny
The system stand up
Provide people not to make money
I remember standing in the County Line like Coolio
With a bomb ass record deal
Feeling like i'm just something
Then I got to thinking
Ahh, self-pitty don't have nathing to do with the progression of {self?}
It's your [?] don't be a disaster
See I'd rather have a million niggas mad at me
Just to see my pockets happy
Real nigga gonna keep it nappy
Real nigga gonna keep it nappy
On the grind, on the grind
On the grind-ha-ha

[Outro]
Well alright, now you have it
A story thats been told
Umm, if you wanna be rich get up off your ass
Put it in gear baby
It's going down
Millennium balling
Well alright
