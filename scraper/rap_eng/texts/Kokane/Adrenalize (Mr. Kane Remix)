(Adrenalize me)

[Verse 1]
Come a little bit closer, before we begin
Lemme tell you how I want it and exactly what I need
I'm here for one drug, I'm only here for one thing
So, come on and tell me can you fly like you're free?
'Cause I need to feel, yeah, I need to say...

[Chorus]
I must confess I'm addicted to this
Shove your kiss straight through my chest
I can't deny I'd die without this
Make me feel like a god, music, love and sex
(Adrenalize me)

I crave excess, turning wine into sweat
Dripping down my neck
I can't deny I'd die without this
Make me feel like a god, adrenaline and sex

[Verse 2]
Get a little bit higher so we can fall till we bleed
Push a little bit harder, pull me into the speed
So tell me, can you feel this? Come into my dream
Are you ready to awaken? Are you ready to feed?
'Cause I need to feel, yeah, I need to say...

[Chorus]
I must confess I'm addicted to this
Shove your kiss straight through my chest
I can't deny I'd die without this
Make me feel like a god, music, love and sex
(Adrenalize me)

I crave excess, turning wine into sweat
Dripping down my neck
I can't deny I'd die without this
Make me feel like a god, adrenaline and sex

[Bridge]
We have to live before we die
We were born to live before we die
Don't you wanna live before you die?
Let me see you live before you die!

(Right here, right now) Adrenalize me!
(Right here, right now) Adrenalize!
(Right here, right now) Adrenalize me!
(Right here, right now) I'm addicted to this

[Chorus]
I must confess I'm addicted to this
Shove your kiss straight through my chest
I can't deny I'd die without this
Make me feel like a god, music, love and sex
(Adrenalize me)

I crave excess, turning wine into sweat
Dripping down my neck
I can't deny I'd die without this
Make me feel like a god, adrenaline and sex
(Adrenalize me)
