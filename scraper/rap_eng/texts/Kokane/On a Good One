[Verse 1: Grynch]
Young GR-Y-N to the C-H killing it with each bar
Still rising trying to be great
For Pete sake been up in the game and yeah I'm bout' to
Going to kick some shit that's bound to earn points like hauschka
Seatown veteran I'm better than I've ever been a way is where I never went
So haters let that settle in
Since old folk fo' show yeah I walk the main line
Check the track record you got one well it ain't mine
Waist time never on these bums with they week flows
Bitter ass old heads bunch of uncle Ricos
Stuck up in the past that's some shit I don't subscribe to
Sorry dude they say you're nice well you've just been lied to
From my view its clear that we ain't cut from the same cloth
Been doing this for years you still stuck in same spot
You suckers is lame stop it just isn't dope
Unlike me, on a good one when you sniffing some coke oh

[Hook: Kokane]
I'm so damn high
I don't want to please don't play no mind
Cause I'm on a good one girl
I couldn't gives a fuck
I'll I want to do is hear them go
Cause I'm on a good one girl

[Verse 2: Grynch]
My position I earned that and if you listened you've learned that
Times up the clock a best you wish you could turn back
But sure fax me I don't know a god damn thing
To cats that come up to the table and nothings all they bring
The same old song they sing waiting for someone to save em'
And they ain't got a tool to use the two heads that God gave em'
Put in your own work man I thought you a grown jerk
I thought that I would do it you lifted your own skirt
I'm leaving these songs murked but really oh what else is new
One of the best up in the six for years as if we tell the truth
You can lead a horse to water but can't make him drink
Swear to God the solids in the game are going straight extinct
And I can say it till I'm blue in the face
So i'm gonna keep it on rolling while they losing the race
They music just ain't nah man it just isn't dope
Unlike me on a good one like I'm hitting some dro oh

[Hook: Kokane]

[Outro: Kokane]
I'm on a good one tonight
I'm on a good one
Do you wanna have a good time with me?
We can get drunk
So high
Fuck it till we reach the sky
Fuck it i'm on one
