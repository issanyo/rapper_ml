[Tray Deee]
What up cuhz? You know ain't nothin' different on mines
When I hit up motherfuckers with that look in my eyes
It's a statement that I'm makin' and ain't takin' no backtalk
I'm blowin' niggas hats off as soon as my gat cough
The last thought you rappin' niggas should think
Is you could never get as gangsta as Tray Deee on the beat
On the streets, over beef, you don't compete with uno
You know - the general a criminal do-low
Committed cause I'm wit it, then I spit it and live it
Niggas timid in my vision, I cause tension and thinkin'
By my presence I'm the answer to societys hate
A true rider with the mind to push the mightiest weight
Fools petty and they ready, steady comin' with bullshit
A full clip what you'll get that hit like a mule kick
A sure hit, that's all I'm aimin' for when I blast
Motherfuckers hit the deck once I go in the dash

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Now is the time, this is the place
To bang back the khakis with the Chuck's fat laced
West is the Coast, East is the side
Long Beach is the city where them gangstas ride
Money brings power, power bring respect
Disrespect the set I gots to grab the tec
This is how it goes and that's how it's done
Eastside 2-1 in the land of the thug

[Tray Deee]
Yeah niggas, how you figure that the game gon' wait?
I came home straight from the pen to take yo' place
Ain't no chase, this paper comin' soon as I post up
And watch the victim clock and catch him choppin' his dope up
Fuck his hopes up - stripped, gagged, and roped up
Take the whole cut and leave him swoll and ghost up
I'm ruthless, I shoot Crips and Bloods alike
Thug for life, come and catch the slugs at night
Insane mental frame, feel no shame or pitty
Since the game is shitty I gots to bang the city
Strictly gangsta so I bring the terroristical heat
Rap, scrap, jack, and mack to reach the tip of the peak
This is the Beach, now any nigga got a rebuttal -
Gon' be eatin' what he speakin' once he peek at the muzzle
Struggled hard for my title and intend to hold it
You want it? - then all invitations open

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Now is the time, this is the place
To bang back the khakis with the Chuck's fat laced
West is the Coast, East is the side
Long Beach is the city where them gangstas ride
Money brings power, power bring respect
Disrespect the set I gots to grab the tec
This is how it goes and that's how it's done
Eastside 2-1 in the land of the thug

[Tray Deee]
I take seven ol' B's put 'em in the street
Then that's seven more bustas who claim they got heat
And it'll take seven more C-fore I start to reach
Then that's 2-1 for the set I left stretched out in the street
Tray Deee never do it easy, fool so don't expect it
Niggas get checked and they sets disrespected
No question, I'm all you ever thought that you was
Til' you ran across the boss and now you coughin' up blood
Shoot first, fools curse 'fore they kick up dust
Clip gon' bust, then they gon' have to pick loc up
All that talkin' cause I'm chalkin' whole districts off
Senseless loss, a curb where niggas piss me off
Conflict with my click, get your bitch ass touched
All my comrads bomb fast, it's as sick as fuck
2-1 'til I'm done, never run from the turf
Check the cash when we mash. always rugged, the worst
