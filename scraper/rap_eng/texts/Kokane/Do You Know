Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like all the things that life is showing you?
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you learn from the things that life has put you through?

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
All my life in the ghetto, conditions uncomfortable
Watchin' TV, I wish I was a huxtable
Father like Cosby, y'all was just a thought
A dream, my daddy in the streets with them fiends
Mom's in the room, rollin' up her weed
Project parties every night, no sleep
That was back then, on the handlebars of a Schwinn
High off beadies, trippin' off gin
Just a little nigga, needed more guidance
All I know is money, all I know is violence
Life is a plane, and you just the pilot
Watch it, you crash and you burn if you wilin'
I never talk much, silent, gangsters move in silence
You talk too much then you lyin'
In the streets from the words that you speak
I seen it too many times, talk is cheap
Listen

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Jay Rock's the name
Grew up on blocks where them rocks were slang
Glocks were aimed, blood was spilled
Still crack bottles, got cups to fill
Blunts to smoke, kids to feed
All we know is guns, sex, money and weed
Tryna live right, I was doin' it wrong
Stress in my brain had me down in patron
Strokin' on some pussy almost every day
Pimpin' these hoes to put some food on my plate
I know it sounds harsh, but somebody gotta do it
Fake niggas claiming they real but I'm the truest
Sippin' on that Cuervo, watching my days go
Stackin' my pesos, keepin' my cake close
Doin' my thing, bro, niggas they hate, though
Real niggas love me, I stay connected like legos

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Just livin' life, every day, every night
Drinkin' brown, getting high, feelin' right
I'm in the sky, I ain't dancing with the stars
I'm in the club, might be dancing with your broad
I'm stressed out, because the bills due tomorrow
Tryna drink it off, if the rap don't work, it's to the raw
A nine-to-five ain't me, nigga, fuck your boss
I ain't tryna take a loss and at any cost
I'ma get it like I know how
With the work, I walk inside a bank with my Chrome out
It could happen, what do you do when the pressure come?
Don't let the Devil hit your pressure points, pay attention
