Cut the wipping got some new interest to stay on
Put the pain on that new nigga that hate on
My name is on the wall I say, while I stay on this list
LA you can tell 'em high but also tell 'em you can still tell when They telling lies on
On the rise blessing in the sky
Eyes of a kilelr with obligation of wild fault
Oh my God free my nigas doing though
Fuck the bitches zipping liquer, tell the whores to get in line for Sure
And you know the jelousy should be a crime
They feel me when they hear me

Niggas be talking loud, I'm a dupping real rould
Knocking half of you brains out

Cash, count nigga you figure blood come gush now
Penetenciary proud with a murder as smile
Murder as crowd, how the fuck this nigga is loud
To get two steps South when you know it's about
To be a problem when you see me moving around
Give me hibby-chibes when he's moving about
Past movie be out of film
I won't sue you look it's no hustle be hang like tasle
Smashing all these aswels, stuck like, stuck in castro
I'm so pastro, a cook with a castle
Draped nothing but nights in cooks and castle
I took my last pool now hi see it, feel it, I hear it, listen

Listen up nigga
I know you hear me niggas
