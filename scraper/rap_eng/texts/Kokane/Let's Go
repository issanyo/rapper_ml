Well I'm an old-fashioned nigga
With old-fashioned ways
Rollin' the candy cutty, still listen to The Bar-Kays
I still smoke a Zig Zag, fuck a blunt
Cuz you can't even taste the weed, I ain't gotta front
But enough about me, let's talk about you
So sophisticated, ask the question "what you into?"
She said she like poppin' tags
Someone to make her laugh, and goin' home with a buncha bags
Late-night candlelight dinners
And I love it when she says she's allergic to them broke niggas
Don't fuck with squares, only thugs
Baby me and you fit more than the O.J. glove
Figured I'd lock you down like Fort Knox
That's when she put my hand on her fart box
We a match made in heaven, pack your bags and let's go
You ain't never been on a ride like this before

Here we go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
I guess you never know
Here we go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
I guess you never know

All natural, face of an angel
Got more ass than Amber Rose and J. Lo
Hella feminine, smellin' like cinnamon
I just wanna get to know you better so we can try to spend
A little time over a glass of wine
Kick back, recline, it's on, we blow about a half a zone
Body hella tight, outta mind, outta sight
But what's a bad chick if the toes ain't right?
And if she ain't got game, she just a pretty bitch with no brains
Now me and you been kickin' it about six months
And girl I admit, you ain't pulled no stunts
You never know when you meet the right honey
Cuz most of these pretty bitches only in it for the money
But you never know

Here we go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
I guess you never know
Here we go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
I guess you never know

I can make you feel alright
Baby all through the night
And when it's cold, you love it when I hold you tight
I ain't never met a girl like you
You ain't never met a nigga like me
We got that chemistry
Let's do what comes naturally

Yeah little mama
You ridin' with a real one
And I'm surprised at myself
You know I go hard on a bitch
But you're not a bitch, you're a classy woman

I guess you never know
I guess you never know
