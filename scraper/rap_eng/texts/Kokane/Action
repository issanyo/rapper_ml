[Intro]
Lawhouse excels with the next level

[Verse 1]
My name is Kokane and I'm dope
Intertwine your mind as ya hope
To cope with the nigga that may not wonder
Sucka's that a shock by my words
That are put into a walls of wonder
Cause I don't give a fuck
Cause I'm a ballin' ass player
Especially cause I'm makin' mega bucks
I be wretched with the hoes
With the Camisa clothes
Accept for the bitches that got a fuckin'
Nose up in the air like the shit
Ho's like that can suck my motherfucking dick
Ya see
At the age of 13 I was a hustler
Slanging dopes here and there
With a bitch and a duster
I even had a pager
Every day was making money like deja'vu
Because a nigga did what he had to
Get clout of being pimped out the biggest mack daddy
Years later nothing changed
Except that am rollin' in a caddy 'allante
I fuck a bitch on the spot
And say touch√©
So if you think you can get some
Ya speaking obsurd
Cause action's speak louder than words

[Chorus]
Pimp mack daddy looking for the dollar

[Verse 2]
I'm a crazy motherfucker from the streets
When my dick gets hard Is when ya see a nigga creep
Erect and eject for a piece of tush
But never fuck a bitch if she hasn't had a douche
I don't ratch with the pussy that smell like red snapper
Stick my dick in her and catch a clapper
I ain't a stupid motherfucker
I got some dirty pussy'er
Go get a bucket of chicken
Finger licking to a nigga that's kickin'
Ho's that wanna fuck there easy picking
I don't mean to brag or boast Or be conceded
I'm just proving a point
I'm not defeated
Can you beat
Go bought the CD
Your bout to get deleted
From existence
Now my mission is completed
Have ya singing the blues
Your refuse and abuse to choose ya lose
Follow my rules listen to bad news
Cause I'm a nigga that made it
Cause I pay dues
I make rules to fools a school
When I'm in duel
Fuck up a St. Ides brew
That a screw
So if ya think you can get some
Ya speaking obsurd
Cause action's speak louder than words

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Mississippi/ miss sippy got the cannabis
? got mary jane
Me feeling fucked up Put on the insanes
The telephone rings
I pick up the reciver
Betty was on the other line
She wants to meet the skeezer
Got to her house in no times flat
She said she wanted to fuck
But first i got to have a jimmy cap
Shit i din't know it was like that
I got an idea
I guess i'll use the saran wrap
Put it on my dick so i can go up in ya'
Miss stucky is lookin for a piece of chicken dinner
She said i guess thats cool
I was scared of getting pregnant
I don't wanna crum
Cause I'll abandoned it
Cause a penny for your thoughts
A nickel for my dick
A dime if ya tell me that ya fuck me
Lay down bitch cuz you bout to get diversion-ized
I'll be gentle but open up them big gorgeous as thighs
So I can get some
Little does she know
Im gonna fuck her then run
So i precede with the plan
I put the pussy in the mix like cake batter
Stimulating of a nut splatter
The turning betty said don't walk no more
I took my motherfucking 16 cent?
And headed out the door
My name is kokane
And I ain't synthetic
Cause I feel
That action's speak louder than words
Get it

[Outro]
Lawhouse slanging Kokane in your hood legally
And that how we stay above the law
