Well alright y'all
Citizens of the universe
Greetings
I wanna send a special shout out the whole world
Let's go

[Bridge]
Hello hello hello hello
Hello world

Well alright y'all
Once again
We are back at ya
Doing it to your ear hole
We have now taken over your broadcast station
And will return you to your previous channel in a minute

For we control your vertical
We control your horizontal
We control your thoughts
It's that real shit
The final frontier
For these are the voyagers from the underground
To take you to a place
And boldly go where no nigga has been before
Ewww

He was the coldest ass nigga that you ever seen
When he hit the block
I got thoughts of a all black cadillac
Make your heart stop
Baddest nigga on the scene
Fit so clean
Bumping that old school Al Green
Neighboorhood pusherman
Picking up ki's in a gangsta lean

[Bridge]
Hello hello hello hello
Hello world

Here we are
We some gangstas
Entertain us
Making paper
Acting stupid
So contagious

Here we are
We some gangstas

Hello world, nigga I'm a rep my city
I'm a gangsta motherfucker tryna get it like 50
A nigga straight from the slums
And I show no pitty
Born hustler
Nursing from a basehead titty
Taught at a early age
How to knuckle up
I had a old cousin named Leonard
That use to fuck us up
One thing that I learned is how to be a man
Now I'm nice with my hands
These niggas don't wanna dance

[Bridge]
Hello hello hello hello
Hello world

Here we are
We some gangstas
Entertain us
Making paper
Actin stupid
So contagious

Here we are
We some gangstas
