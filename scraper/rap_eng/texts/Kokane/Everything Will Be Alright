[Verse 1]

[Cold 187um]
We for breakin' backs in the '94, time to play a ho
Like we never did befo'
Since the prices went up for a piece a ass
See, I still get freebies cause I got gap
And when it comes to the question
"What have you done for me lately?"
Yo, G, I make them bitches hate me

[KM.G]
So grab ya coat, grab ya hat, cause it's like that
Ya try and play the role and ain't nothin' but a hood rat
So don't front, yeah, your name's Terri not Halle
But you sprung like a motherfucker when I hit that berry
And let a ho know what's poppin'
Cause it comes with the territory when you come a jocking

[Hook: Kokane] (x4)
Everything will be alright

[Verse 2]

[KM.G]
Yeah I'm in the mood I need a ho with much aptitude
To creep wicked, to come kick it
With the P-I-M-P, pimp clinic number 1
Ya say I ain't shit but ya sprung
But ya holds the number ya folds the number
Then ya crawls to my house for a late night slumber

[Cold 187um]
Yeah, cause bitches in the 90s ain't shit
They claim that they a lady, steady
Suckin' every other niggas dick
So now you at my house on my couch screamin' out
My name, my status and my motherfuckin clout
"And ya nigga don't know whats going on."
Cause he always broke and he always gone
Now people might say that I am scandalous
But it ain't my fault if a bitch can't handle this

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]

[Kokane]
Now I just had did a flyer show
I bumped up so I gotta spit at the ho
Yeah, she bound to let me stroke but make no mistake
I got a 8 year bid next day for a rape
Owww, actin' like crows
And ya wonder why we call ya bitches and skeezas and hoes

[Cold 187um]
Yeah, she shoulda used the fuckin' mace
Tryin' to come up on the homie cause the county check was late
Uh, thats the problem with you bitches nowadays
Since you drop a couple a babies think you kickin' it and gettin' paid
I waitin' for Mr. Timesalt
So he can play the fuckin' cream puff and pay my fuckin' bills off

[Hook x4]

[Verse 4]

[Cold 187um]
I only speak of what I've been through best
Believe I've been around, I'm from the pimp clinic
Hip, keep ya veins in ya fuckin' mouth
Bitches used to treat me like a bowl of onion soup
Now they gettin' tossed on the hood of my Lexus Coup√©
I keep clownin' as you hoes cause you boos
I got the hat, the nose and the motherfuckin' funny shoes

[KM.G]
I clown bout' the witness, I kick this
Bookers in my business know I'm attracted to the bombay
Ya know the thickest ones around here like to play
And hit you up with that ass with no delay
Shit, I learned hoes like takin' off they clothes
When them 100 Dollar bills is on the flo', really doe

[Hook x8]
