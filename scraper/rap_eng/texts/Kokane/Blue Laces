[Verse 1: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Im from Westside California, they run up on ya
Ask you where you from and check yo tats under yo clothin'
Hustla, go hard make sure my knot swollen
Fuck it, say the wrong hood bullets explodin'
I trust few, people these days cuz that's golden
I seen niggas get killed for who they roll with and chose to
Keep inside they
Circle satan sittin' on your sofa
Same nigga that shot you was the one you used to smoke with
Cold shit, my whole clique notorious
You've heard of us, six owes is murderas
You still servin' clucks, jealous nigga you broke as fuck
Yo bitch on my nuts, spillin' patron out my cup
She can't get enough, buffer me down as I puff on the finest kush
They say I be doin' too much, I just do my stuff
Yeah, I just do my stuff
(Hussle x2)

[Hook x2]
Blue Laces, shell cases, we catch bodies, we don't leave no traces
Big faces, suitcases, if you ain't know ho, we gettin' paid bitch

[Verse 2]
I got Slauson on my back, Ed Hardy on my hip
Weight of the world on my shoulders, gold rollie on my wrist
Neighborhood chucks, blue checkerboard tint, dickies saggin' off my ass
Walk with a hoodsta limp, two bricks on my white tee
Same color cocaine, I ain't talkin' dope I mean the price of my gold chain
All money in no money out that was my slogan
What I mean by that is stack it up and don't spend no change
I started small time, dope game, cocaine
Seven grams and thirty rocks that
Was my program
The block propane, young nigga no change
Shootout with no aim, so they no yo name
Cuz when yo momma paid rent that was yo game
So when yo homeboy bled, that was yo pain
And if ya'll both catch a case you don't say no names
That's just the code of the color of my shoe strings

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
What happened to the code, streets all in shambles
Niggas powderin' they nose, ashamed of what we stand for
They think we on some kill another nigga shit
We really on some stay down and diligent
The streets is cold, turn innocence to militence
Young niggas gangbangin' for the thrill of it
Pops was gone, moms was never home
The streets was right there so they took you as they own

[Hook x2]
