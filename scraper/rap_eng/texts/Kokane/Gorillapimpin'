[Intro/Hook: Cold 187Um]
Wherever we go
Another player hoe
From city to city
We still Gorilla pimpin'
We still pimpin'
We keep the hoes the Ghetto Stars
We're sippin' caviar
From city to city
We still Gorilla pimpin'
We still pimpin'

[Verse 1: Cold 187um]
Sometimes I have a whole lot of bullshit on my mind
Sometimes I sit and write hype rhymes time after time
About these hoochies, about these hookers, about these hoodrats
Bitch you disrespect that, bitch you get your head cracked
Now, pay your tribute to the P.C.G., yo
(Pimp - Clinic - Gang)
And bow down cause we raw team
Cause I was out in Malibu with this bitch from Honolulu
You should've seen what she wants to do
She wants to do it from the livin' room to the kitchen
I mean all up in the cabinets, breakin' dishes
Yo, now let me tell you somethin', this is how you break a hoe
Tell what she wanna hear, take where she wanna go
And when it gets real good to 'em
You gotta treat them like you don't even ahh care for 'em
Yo, yo, that's a tactic, you call it psychology
We are from the Pimp Clinic, we call it pimpology
And we pimped on like them Rolling Stone makin' hits
All up in the traffic, yellin' fuck a bitch
Yo, on that for reala my nigga
Yo, cause when I pimps, I pimps like a Gorilla, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2: KM.G]
?? with the antenna, hangin' with my Banana
Banana be in my clip, A.K. - set trip
Keep the Clinic mingle, peep the new single
Flossy pimp nigga, peep cap when I hit you with the mental
Caravan cause the ho's look good to me
They spit light too, I was hookin' up their weed
Now, they be streamin', and they got their mack on
Come on, yeah they speadin' love as I get my grind on the Microphone
Slide you in the homie's Benz, spend some of the homie's ends
Hell of conversation with you and a friend
I never lied to you, just so I can slide through you
Check it out, let me show you the view
And continue, to smell good and look good
And still be chasin' them hoodrats, like a nigga should be
With a hell of a Chronic Sack, with my fat ass Gat
Yeah, nigga's got a Low-Rider, plus, I mobs with my rockweiler
Chronic so the ho's follow
Worldwide, cause that's what I wanna do
Click with my ignint, Pimp Clinic crew

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Enuff]
I'm a type of nigga that cause a gang of drama
Posted, chillin', see I'm all up in your baby's mamma
Fools, get trippin' like they're royal
But see half of these bitches couldn't spell the word LOYAL
I run deep with a gang of killas
So if it's static, you better come for reala
I say trust no ho til the day you die
And don't be showin' these ho's your safe because it's suicide
I hit the A.C. as I roll through Killa
California, on the 10 on my way to Pomona
To make peace with my kinfolks, marinate off some hell of a smoke
I keep it real like I used to do on the street
Cause still water's run deep
And if you really wonder how I feel-a
Can't nobody get by a Gorilla

[Verse 4: Kokane]
Ugh, we run game on you ho's from start to finish
Now, it's the good, the bad and the pimpish
Now, why would I run down the hill and fuck one cow
When I can creep down the hill and fuck 'em all
Ugh, I know this freaky P-Y-T, so young, so sweet
She was only Seventeen
At one of my shows, kickin' it backstage
You know them young ass bitches never act the age
She whispered in ear: do you wanna fuck?
This young bitch made my dick hairs curl up on my nuts
My spidersense is tinglin', this bitch kept on minglin'
She gave the pussy and in my ride she wants to be a singer
Promises, promises
I tapped that ass and kicked the bitch up out my S-Class
And on my dash it say: pimpin' ain't easy
I can't kick it around the bitch that got no rhyme with me, ugh

[Hook]
