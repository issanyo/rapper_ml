Yeah (repeat 6x)
You are now tuned into the real deal

[Verse 1: Kokane]
It's like gangstas and ryders
Players with dreams
I put that mega shit down and blow my magazine
My nigga '87 told me I was dope
Yeah, doper than Run's brim
Doper than DMC's golden chain
And it be real and it's like that
So let's take these motherfuckers way back
I said I came in the do' (say what)
I said it befo' (that's right)
All you bitch ass nigga's face down on the floor
Cause if you're fighting me, biting me
Steadily on my mind
First nigga even flinch
I'm gonna shoot em' with my 9, I want
Rings and watches, you know what I mean
Plus some hostages to make the getaway clean
Yeah, put backup on my tales about my 2-11
My name is Kokane and that's 187
We like the dynamic duo in the batmobile
Except when we dip through
We laced in S-DeVille?
And we be sharp like our uncle Eric used to be
Limousine tint with the TEC on the seat, yo
Giving them playa haters migraines, chest pain
It's the original
The unforgettable
Cause I be mobbin' through the streets
Man I be still gettin' high, sippin' V.S.O.P
So, no pain no gain, yeah
Bakin' soda free
And they call me Kokane
What's all gold don't glitter, nigga
How could you figure
That you could stop the flow of Kokane making scrilla'
I hang with real motherfuckers
I'm Above The Law down
I got game like my nigga Charlie Mack from Sintown
4 ryders only

[Hook]
You've got to give it up
4 ryders only
Oh, all over the world
It's ryders only
You've got to gimmie some love
It's ryders only
4 ryders only

[Verse 2]
Pimp clinic niggas in the park
Straight gettin' wicked after dark
I got my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run
Because I'm feelin like an outlaw
Broke my step daddy's jaw
Hear 'em say "You want some more?"
Living on a see-saw
That's how it is out in Cali where we stay
Like Toddy Tee, Mix Master Spade and them Rodney-O tapes
Man, I heard you's on the run from the feds

Yeah
Cause it's Kokane not Lemonhead
It's Kokane not Lemonhead

Cause I was there when Uncle Jam rip the L.A. county federals
There when Daryl Gates came with the batterram
Yo, them motherfuckers caught me on it
What time was that
It was six in the morning, uh
I'm finna act a fool like King Tee
Full of that 8 Ball like Eazy-E
Yo, I get loc'd out the dome like my nigga Tone
And spit game like my name's Jerome
I'm telling baby
Now, what's your phone number
How can I get in to your panties tonight
I said a penny for my thoughts
A nickle for my dick
A dime if you tell me that you fuck me
Yeah, cause we be going for the kill
So all the ryders much love
Keep it real

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now 50 niggas in the room
Like the legion of doom
Thinking about which territory to consume
Because Italian's got a mafia
Jew's got a mafia
Nigga's got a mafia
And they know they can't stop ya, right
White people got a mafia but they label as the cops
And that Japanese mob make all the Glock
I said the world is getting rotten like tooth decay
While the Mexican mob got all the Ya
I got some work for the Colombian's to be a ghetto star
Me and my friend named Escobar
How you gone tell me not to slang my coke or weed
When I got motherfucking mouths to feed
See they don't know it's like a jungle
Sometimes It makes me wonder
How we go through so much drama
And never do go under, yo
Because the P.O. he all up at my mama house
Stressin her and testing her
All about my where-abouts
What I got, how I get into, who I'm fucking
What kind of gun I got
What type of bullets im bustin'
I packs a trey 5-7 like Dirty Harry
I was taught how to shoot by my great granpappy
Yo, I come high like del-dogg?
So if ya see me on the show, I'mma floss ya
Yeah
