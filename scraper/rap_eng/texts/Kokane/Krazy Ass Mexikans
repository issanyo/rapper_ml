[Mr. Shadow]
What's crackin'
Shadow in San with my dog, Bad Boy
Javie Lopez track, you know how we do this shit
West coast, motherfucker

[Verse 1: Mr. Shadow]
Heads turn with concern when I bend the block
You motherfuckers don't learn that I'm burnin' hot
Only G's on my team always ready to bust
Make G's everyday, in green paper, we trust
Check your nuts cause the streets ain't givin' a fuck
Me and my shadow on the hunt, gettin' rid of you punks
Gun carriers
Eliminate your whole area
Mass destruction, make your family bury ya
I'm way ahead of you snitches and haters
Bitches take pictures, yeah, they say, we're the greatest
Perpetrators ain't allowed in my vacinity
Fuck around and get blood in your facility (Pop)
Your tranquility will fade to none
Cause I'm that bald motherfucker with the loaded gun
Holdin' everyone responsible
Motherfucker
I'm the reason why they say that anything is possible

[Mr. Shadow]
Motherfucker

Chorus: Ant Dog
Fuck 'em all, they wanna bank it
We rarely
Advise before you make a move or (???) can't be daily
Talkin' big shit, but ain't got the balls to face me
Fully loaded clip, no mask, all safety

[Kokane]
West coast and we rock the most
For all my gangstas and all my hoes
You know, Bad Boy and them
He some crazy ass Mexicans
Well, good Lord

[Verse 2: Bad Boy]
I'm in the S.D
Smokin' lye immensely
Shadow in the drop, throwing up the S-3
You sexy, ma, won't you stop and let's freak
Dick's about as big as the size the checks be
I'm serious, you been sweet since scent of sticks
I fuck around it
Now let me say my synopsis
Then fuck rap
I'm just in it for dividens
Addicted to the streets, bitches sweet as cigarettes
I got a question
Who the hardest in it?
It's us, homie, stop ya feelin'
It's the lyrical rappin' phantom, I blast at 'em
Dippin' up and watch, I spit and backstab 'em
The gat clapper
Call me the Madd Rapper
You actin' rap, back turd, the gat'll gat ya
And I'm done, leave ya twisted, dude
Leave you bitches like some pigeon fool

[Mr. Shadow]
Motherfucker

Repeat Chorus

[Kokane]
West coast and we rock the most
For all my gangstas and all my hoes
You know, Shadow and them
He some crazy ass Mexicans
Well, good Lord

[Verse 3: Mr. Shadow]
When I aim at your frame, you will see the light
They ain't taking me in without putting a fight
Damn right, I'm a west side G for real
Pack steel, then roll around with intentions to kill
I'm the king of my own hill
Make ya blood spill
Quick, motherfucker, still down to let ya heart squeal
I once killed in bigger bills, no question
Pushed on the whips for rainy days, no stressin'
Got blessed on my so-called riders
Dead on arrival, no chance for survival
You're wearing blindfolds, you can't see Shadow
And if you did, it's on local rap channel
Plenty of ammo with extra clips
And you can bet ya punk ass that your wig'll split
Spit game at your trick cause she loves the dick
Me and my gangsta Bad Boy, criminal shit
Bitch

[Mr. Shadow]
Motherfucker

Repeat Chorus

[Kokane]
West coast and we rock the most
For all my gangstas and all my hoes
You know, Bad Boy and them
He some crazy ass Mexicans
Well, good Lord
