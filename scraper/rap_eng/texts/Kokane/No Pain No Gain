No pain no gain
I can see clearly out my window
I'm just sitting here, remembering the good bets I took
That we used to go through
(Boo hoo, you know what I mean)
We have friends and enemies that pass our way
But I think Lord
(I think Lord)
I think Lord will you let me breath another day?
(Let me breath another day)

I'm just sitting here
Looking through the windows of my mind
Of what we used to go through
The good and bad times
So now I'm down on my knees, begging you
Please, don't reap what I sow
Cause Lord I just want
Cause Lord I just want
To see my little children grow

So, no pain no gain
I can see clearly out my window
I'm just sitting here, remembering the times
That we used to go through
We have friends and enemies that come my way
But I think Lord
(I think Lord)
Will you let me breath another day?

Now I'm true to myself
Which makes me feel so fine
But Lord I can't help to think of all the wrong things I did
I'm gonna be in time
So why can't we sing a different so..., sing a different song
Cause Lord it makes me upset
To see one of my friends here
And the next day they are gone

No pain no gain
I can see clearly out my window
I'm just sitting here, remembering the good bets I took
That we used to go through
(Boo hoo, you know what I mean)
We have friends and enemies that pass our way
But I think Lord
(I think Lord)
I think Lord will you let me breath another day?
(Let me breath another day)

So, no pain no gain
I can see clearly out my window
I'm just sitting here, remembering the times
That we used to go through
We have friends and enemies that come my way
But I think Lord
(I think Lord)
Will you let me breath another day?
