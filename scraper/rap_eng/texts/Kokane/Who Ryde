[Intro: KM.G (whispering)]
Yeah y'all know how, out here
They won't let a nigga join a team and shit
So I guess, I just have to join a gang
Damn my appetite for tough shit
Come on with me

[KM.G]
Tack me up baby, get me up, ace Nigga in the front
Me trey in me back and me stay strapped
Bail and hangin', doin' a little dirt with my niggas
While we flirt with some skirts, you know some hookers
But we stay with it, yeah, we flip it
We find us, a motherfuckin' Chevy, then we dip it
Then they asked me: "Why you're in the game
Rollin' S-classes, humpin' Kokane?"

[Kokane]
Yeah, see you're lookin' at my hoochie it's about that time
That me rollin' with my clique
Pimp Clinic hittin' dodo sticks
Cause bitches be sayin: "Hey, Mr. Gold Wire player
Won't you come out to be my hoe layer?"
Nah bitch, I'll be sittin' at the dock of the bay
Wating for the snow to roll in, split end
It's Kokane a/k/a the black hopper
Surrounded by the black teamsters with triple beamers
Cause sometimes it gets so hard to slang yo stuff
What you said KM.G?

[KM.G] Chocolate Nuts
[Kokane] What you got KM.G?
[KM.G] Big brown chocolate nuts
[Kokane] What we got KM.G?

[KM.G]
Chocolate nuts
And I'm lookin' for them hookers with them big chocolate butts
To come get naked while we laugh about my jail record
Gimmie' the drawers girl, so check it
As I flow watch my bottom drop
And I be fillin' my top, hittin' you up on your block

[Hook: Kokane] (x2)
Hard hard hard
Hard hard hard
Hard hard hard
Hoping there's a change

[Cold 187um]
They wanna stop gangsta rap but they're kind of late
Cause I've been kickin' gangsta shit for 7 years straight
And best believe makin' the end, ugh
Puttin' in work for my niggas in the pen
Cause see, once upon a time I had a cabin sack
I start flossin' and flossin' and never got tracked
Smokin' weed everyday
And making funky beats for my niggas around the way
Yeah, now I think I'm worth millions
And your white folks mad cause I'm sellin' to your childrens
By the ounce and by the key
They don't wanna be like Mike, they wanna be like me
What's happenin' in the ghetto ain't happenin' in Bel Air
And I'm from California, not Delaware
So boo-yaa, boo-yaa, boo-yaa, what's happenin' partner?
Ugh, I'm all in this track and I'mma break you off somethin' proper
Cause I'm the C-O-L-D, original 187 in the place to be
So when you see me, you better give me my props
Or get popped by the .44 and lined out in Shot sippin'
And for me, see that's a promise, I ain't trippin'
Boy, I'm just honest, ugh

[Hook] (x2)

[Tone Loc]
I kick back, relax, cause I'm fat and all that
When I attack, it's like a swing of a Baseball bat
Don't appose me, cause I live my life cosy
If I had a ring I'll be around rosie
Lived my early years straight like a hoodlum
No time for women cause I've never understood them
They wanted to hold me, stretch me in Coupe De
Rather have my forties an just groove in my hoopty
Comin' down your block, your street, comin' down your avenue
Check that gratitude, check my attitude
You wanna run up, you got your gun up
Fool, what's up?
Shit, you betta not even hiccup
Cause if you do, I'mma break your jaw
Loc, Kokane and Above the Law
Puttin' in work like some old Vietnam vets
What we set, gettin' more more respects
With residuals as individuals sad as pitiful
That you can't get a hook
Of Tone Loc kickin' that raw shit for your life
West Side Tribe and Black Mafia Life

[Hook] (x2)
