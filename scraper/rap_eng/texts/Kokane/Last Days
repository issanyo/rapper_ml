[Intro: Dialogue]
[Kokane] The whole fucking world is going mad. (*Laughter*)
Well check this out
What the fuck would you do if you only have five minutes to live?
Would you do some evil shit?
[Km.G] Hell yeah
[Kokane] Or would you repent the name of your motherfucking soul?
Yo Frost
[Frost] What's up?
[Kokane] Tell these motherfuckers your last confession

[Verse 1: Frost]
The murders, I never really planned them
I just read through the telephone book chose them random
Mrs Jones, 215 South Michigan, Apartment 14, yo my victim
I'm at home polishing my Chrome and rolling joints
And put the silent knot in the tips of the hollow points
Dumb bitch, left the door unlocked
Now I'm putting on my Ski mask and .45 is cocked
Trying to stay quit, the front door is squeezed
Anxious, I haven't seen blood of weaks
Known that cops wanna fold me
Thinking of some shit my psychiatrist told me
But fuck it, I wanted so that I taste it
One more fantasy for feeling this one life wasting
And they said I have a fucked up view
Now purpose through our head and here's your moment of true...

[Hook: Km.G]
We have been to the last days
Last equation, in this situation
Nobody seems concern
As the world turns, as the world turns

We have been to the last days
Last equation, in this situation
Nobody seems concern
As the world turns, as the world turns

[Verse 2: Cold 187Um]
Now see it was once said, yo reap what you sow
But I guess I forgot what I was told
Ugh, I came deep yo, I can't sleep
I'm having a vision of the homie laying dead in the streets
"who did it, who did it"
I don't know, kept peepers over this bitch
On the North side named sherk
So now we on the who-ride, to check that nympho
Pistol whipped, the ho for the Info
Made her call that motherfucker up
Told her tell him that you horny, tell him that you wanna fuck
And when she finished, I told her have a nice day
I shot her in the head twice, put her down the hallway
Right about me, I heard a car pulled up
Yeah, hear coming the punk, but he about to get fucked
Ugh, knock, knock, I let the door slide open
And let my Desert Eagle, do the smoking fool....

[Verse 3: Km.G]
I can exchanging, I can handling
I still flow for all my partners
Cause suckers doing damage
Now I'm on the other side, nigga is looking in
Shooting letters from the Pen, address in my kid
What up, they just shouts to the 'Row
Chaos to the left, seven else to the rows below
And we waiting for an appeal, so chill
And they caping to put up a double meal tickets
So now we kick it, ooh I fucks up and I'm still doing wrong
And trip while write these fly ass rap songs
Teaching' to the balls as I steal
Cause doctor said we can't get the cheer motherfucker.....

[Hook: Km.G]
We have been to the last days
Last equation, in this situation
No body seems concern
As the world turns, as the world turns

We have been to the last days
Last equation, in this situation
No body seems concern
As the world turns, as the world turns

[Verse 4: Frost]
Looking at my clock ticking in my cell
11:55, five minutes to hell (*Clock Strikes*)
Soon I will be deceased, taking to the priest
How did I become this caged up beast
The guard said open up cell block six
I never really liked that son of a bitch
Just the punishment fits the crime
A boy said come on, Kid Frost it's time
Shackle, walking through the corridor
There were faces, that I never saw before
Insert the prosecutor, and some from the press
No bly verse and no last request
I've come strapped and my ankles and wrists
Hitting my eye shed not even resists
And then I get the Grim Reaper kiss
The lights went dim and all you heard was this....

[Outro: Spanish AD LIBS]
