[Verse 1]
Baby I don't like to say goodbye, so this is bye until next time
I see you cause I don't want to leave you oh
I'll just kiss you one last time to leave an imprint on your mind girl
Just for right now, tell me can you hold out?

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember, girl we can be miles apart
And no matter where you are, you're always in my heart, heart

[Chorus]
Baby don't leave, baby just stay right here
Because I ain't going to waste your time
So you don't have to leave my side
You got me open
Don't leave, baby just stay right here
Even if the world goes by
We'll remember our last time
Together

[Verse 2]
I could cry a thousand tears, but that won't keep you here
You said you were finished with this love, so I said why are you giving up on us
I'll love you forever, I promise, but to me forever ain't that long
So baby don't you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl remember, remember, girl we can be miles apart
And no matter where you are, you're always in my heart, my heart

[Chorus]
Baby don't leave, baby just stay right here
Because I ain't going to waste your time
So you don't have to leave my side
You got me open
Don't leave, baby just stay right here
Even if the world goes by
We'll remember our last time
Together

[Bridge]
Don't leave, shawty don't leave
Don't leave me
Don't leave, shawty don't leave
Don't leave me, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby don't leave, baby just stay right here
Because I ain't going to waste your time
So you don't have to leave my side
You got me open
Don't leave, baby just stay right here
Even if the world goes by
We'll remember our last time
Together
