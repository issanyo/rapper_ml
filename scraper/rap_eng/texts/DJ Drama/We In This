Okay, You know you been on my mind, A town I miss you
When ole' girl would come late and bring all her tips through
Break up her weed while I break down my issues
Get paper, she blows that
The next day, you know that
Day dream at night time I think too much
Then I hit the nightclub till its daytime and I drink too much
Not time for no good girl, they hold on and they cling too much
I just want a hood bitch that tell me that I sing too much
Ooohh yeah
Shout out to the women playing yall position
I be moving through my city like a politician
Hope you don't judge me cuz me and you are not all that different
You made me this way, you made me famous, you all assisted
New niggas tryna shine I didn't condone it
But I'm back in this bitch, re-living the moment
I'm about to have it poppin off again
Drama's bout to make it rain on Mary Poppins and her friends
We got..
We got money in our pocket, and whatever you're sipping on
Red-bottom limping around this bitch, what the fuck you tripping on?
Twenty goons, they in this bitch, you better check your tone
And they gon put you back in place if you do something wrong
We in this bitch, yeah we in this bitch
We got a section full of girls and they barely speak any English
Let's toast it up to that life and I mean it
Water water all around me, damn my diamonds are shinin
Money rainin on you bitches future changin the climate
All I hang around is millionaires and a bunch of cunts
Turn up, turn up, turn up it's like a burnt a bunch of Suns
Ahh
From Milwake back to Atlanta
They put my life style on camera
They trippen, no cock and hammers
Addicted to making movies
I like em, when they booshy
Anytime I step out, when I come through, it's a (?)
Ain't rapping to ya, I'm really trapping with words
And I ain't (?) to ya when I say I'm fly as a bird
That girl don't speak no inglo
But she know all my lingo
She know a robber when she see one and she know a c-note
I got a Haitian girl speak creol
And a spanish girl from rio
We could put them in a room together make a perfect combo
They bout that life, im bout that life
Yes we is, yes we is
The money, bitches and cars come with the life that I live
It should of been a designer party, all these designer round me
Pick a name, anything, money can buy what? Diamond chain
Diamond ring, Murcielagos, Balenciagas
We toasted up to the life, niggas it's ours
We got money in our pocket, and whatever you're sipping on
Red-bottom limping around this bitch, what the fuck you tripping on?
Twenty goons, they in this bitch, you better check your tone
And they gon put you back in place if you do something wrong
We in this bitch, yeah we in this bitch
We got a section full of girls and they barely speak any English
Let's toast it up to that life and I mean it
