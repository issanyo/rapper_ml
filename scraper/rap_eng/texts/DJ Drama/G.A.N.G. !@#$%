[Intro]
Pass the weed. Ay nigga, ay you seen that bitch Chloe upstairs, nigga? Bitch was damn near dancin' on my leg, nigga. Ay, ay kill that shit. Now who the fuck is that over there? That don't look like Gotti car? That is that nigga shit. These niggas tryna ride on us, nigga. Fuck that. Hey everybody take your positions, I gotta get my shit upstairs, man. Hey, T Ray, you comin' with me, man. Thes niggas ain't finna fuckin' ride on us

[Verse]
As I stand here in this fuckin' mirror
Pistol in my hand, it’s nothin' but bloody stairs
Cold glasses, watchin' up in the stairs
They watchin' from a corner, cops hop the blocks on her
I tried to make paper, was makin' the block warmer
Aroma of gettin' cake and chasin' cash, tag laser like
I got a stripper that’s workin' for good dollars
I predict myself later in life for some good father
Conflicts of a nigga, so I feel it
Shit I ever wrote, I bet this probably be the realest
And this population full of highly poppin' armadillos
It’s only gettin' realer but these niggas never book 'em
Back in my days, we sold drugs and never took 'em
But look what it’s comin' into
I’m livin' in a war and got pussy up on my mental
Niggas murdered my cousin in front of my grandmother, you the one that had vent to
When rappers got the nerve to make you kill, it’s uneventful
Fuckin' murderer, rappers find you and murder you
That could change me to the same word that I heard you were
But I don’t care about the cycle though
I’m 'bout to lift 'em in the air like you’re Michael yo
A pair of Jordans, black clothin', the Air Forces
Woke up leanin' somethin' like I pad noxious
Fuck the clutch and grab the Nina and that new tutu
Pulled it out from under the sweater and tu tu tuf

[Chorus]
Niggas, young ringin', gun singin' like
Young ringin', gun singin' like

[Verse 2]
Still in shock, never ran up off the block
'Til I felt the shot nearly ring across my top
100 meter dash was the way I start to drop
Thinkin' at my thoughts like damn, man I shot
Another nigga, could’ve been some niggas’ pops
Or brother nigga, hustle figure, help a nigga’s guap more
Wasted out was niggas, been addicted to this pot
Instead of gettin' guap, niggas got evicted from the spot
Could’ve picked the lock, should’ve been a nigga but I’m not
That ignorant just figured that this bickerin' will stop
Liquor run this shot, gotta get my mind off that
Back on guard, my mind on track
Livin' a life of sellin' drugs to niggas gettin' signed off rap
Wasn’t in my plans, neither was this gun up in my hand
But you know how niggas get, not knowin' why niggas weird
And niggas is old and stupid, always doin' hot nigga shit like
Fuck 'em, can’t without 'em, I duck 'em
I figured that if them niggas is with you, there ain’t no trust in you
You love' em from a distance, doin' thug don’t go with niggas
'Cause that could be your greater reason why you’re here in prison
See first 48, I seen the closest niggas snitchin'
And since then, I ain’t been provokin' niggas when they see
I rather can and deal your man the handle on my business then
Dip into the light like I was damn near fishin', gang

[Outro]
Ay, fuck out, fuck out, nigga. Ay Tory, Tory nigga. Get the fuck in the car, we gotta get the fuck up outta here. Shit. Fuck man, these niggas got Mugz and Bogs, my nigga. God fuck. Shit. Ay my nigga, ay nigga, wake the fuck up right now, my nigga. I feel like I'm havin' a prophecy or somethin', nigga. Nigga, Mugz and Bogs ain't get a second chance, nigga but we did. We gotta make it straight with God, nigga. Shit, we don't even know if it's gon' be a second chance next time, Tory. Ay Tory, ay wake the fuck up, my nigga. Tory
