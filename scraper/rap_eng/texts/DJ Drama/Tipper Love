I, I know that you've been holding that bag for me
Yes, she spoils me like I'm a baby
And she holds nothing back from me
So on? nights, I'm her baby

Shes pushing her body like a Glock
Making that tick go tock (yep)
She twist at twelve, down to the ground
And she doin it all night long for the boys

She do it nice and low
But just for the boy
Two free songs
But just for the boy

I call her boomerang
When she doing her thang
She throw it, then she bring it right back
It's her and patrone, all night long
But just for the boy

I get tipper love
Spent so much, that the girls just show me love now
She show me tipper love
Spent so much that I only pull out dubs now
She show me tipper love
I ain't saying I'm a freak, but I gotta see her face
Twice a week now
She show me tipper love
She don't mind, even if I come thru at night time
She give me tipper love
She give me tipper love

Soon as I walk in this (motha, Fu*ka)
So You already know that I'm the (motha, Fu*ka)
I'm looking at her booty like (motha, Fu*ka)
Them haters lookin at me like, you (motha, Fu*ka)

Shes pushing her little body like a Glock

And she doin it all for the boys

She do it nice and low
But just for the boy
She give me two free songs
But just for the boy

I call her boomerang
When she doing her thang
She throw it, then she bring it right back
It's her and patrone, all night long
But just for the boy
