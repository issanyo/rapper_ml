[Intro: DJ Drama (Sage The Gemini)]
Hey Sage
(I would say I'm back but I never left)
I want you to talk that shit!

[Verse: Sage The Gemini]
Fuck your bullshit it really don't amaze me (Bay God!)
I'm on many niggas list trying to erase me
Tell a bitch nigga if them keys paid
You can be an automation clip it still won't faze me
I'm living girl, money fatter than Cartman
Talking shit from a distance like I don't know marksmen
Doing shit [?] like I'm social with corks and I'm really varsity
Rookie and [?] they like "How [?] ya'll got your [?]"
Ya'll the starting team
I was a ghost like [?]
Doing twerk songs bringing out hoes like that nigga Santa
Hating niggas man I can't stand them
So I pump fear and make them hold their chest like the national anthem
See ya'll done brought the Bay Area out
My niggas come from 2 ways like stereo out
Hop off a [?] black match
Carry them out
And Ooh Kill Em' like Terio account
It's real nigga
707 not 007
If you shut the fuck up it might save your ass from heaven
You ain't suffer, niggas don't understand me
[?] but only 2 pieces of cheese can feed the whole family
Yeah, nigga
They say don't forget where you came from or [?] doing stick ups
Fixing, some of these niggas be bitches
Hang a fruit by the foot and beat his ass till' he 6 inches
But, that ain't a gay joke
What's really funny is niggas think whips and chains they really Django
And I'mma shine on this music that's what it's made for
And I hope it's worth every dollar the people paid for
It's me

[Outro: DJ Drama]
You know that's just like a warm up type of thing
I don't want you to get mad
Sage is rich, Drama's rich
Hahahhahah! I'm sorry man
