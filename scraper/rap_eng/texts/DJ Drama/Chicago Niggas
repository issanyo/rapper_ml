[Intro: DJ Drama]
You know, they say the streets lost their edge a little bit
Too much emo rap in the game
Some of your favorites done fell off
And most people leave out a keyword in street music
It's called quality, let's show y'all how it's done

[Verse 1: Moonie]
(Yea, uh, uh)
Tell me what you know about the middle of the map
Gangstas in them all-black White Sox fitted-caps
(DJ Drama: Stay with me)
Posted on the block, thirty-shot clip hanging
This ain't a rap trend, Chi-Town been banging
(Dramatic, nigga)
(You know what I mean? Mr. Thanksgiving)
(Yeah)
...
Shootouts every night, they complaining that they can't sleep
It's a church and a liquor store all on the same street,
Rain, sleet, snow, man, I'm a hustle cocaine
All sales final; I'm a product of this dope game
Shorties got no aim, bullets got no name
Cluckers dancing in a line like they on Soul Train
We don't care about blue lights; come take a picture
Still tipping, that's the day of a Chicago nigga

[Hook/Chorus: ?]
Chicago nigga, this the city of the wind
Niggas on the corner tryna win
Chicago nigga, stay hustling the snow
Niggas even hustle in the snow (yeah)
You see them blue lights in the air, cameras everywhere
We don't give a fuck, we still tipping
Chicago nigga, where they hustling the snow
Niggas even hustle in the snow. Chicago nigga

[Verse 2: Count]
These cops crooked in Chicago
Daley took 'em out them Crown Vics and bought 'em Tahoes
In traffic, I don't panic when I see them police lights
I got them pigs in my pockets like Jody Weis
Hustling that white snow, temperature is ice cold
My workers serving with them cameras on the light-pole
Gangster Disciples, Black Stones, BDs
The biggest street gang is the C-P-D
The sleeve on my Triple Goose smell like gunpowder
Hawk blowing like a car horn stuck in rush hour
Yeah, we swish cheese your driver's side door
That's how it is, that's how we live in Chicago

[Hook/Chorus] (x2)
