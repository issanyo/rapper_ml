[Intro]
Yo yo
Fucking wave, yeah

[Verse 1]
In that thing with the leather seats
Just being me, that one thing you could never be
Tickets to the Grammy's, let me get a seat
Plus one my bitch with me
HS87 over everything
Nike checks all over me and my daughter too
Walking out of Cartier's with the bags
Hopping out the car bumping Carter 2, bitch I thought you knew
Oh, and we on that Jamie Foxx
Oh Nike down to the ankle socks
Besides the studio I'm in the bank a lot
Jerz La Pawn(?) drank a lot, La Familia

[Verse 2]
I might create a plan called the audible
I'm in the place where everybody want a part of you
Don't leave your friend alone she want to party too
I gas a blunt (?) hard to do
Please be gone with that trash ass how your artist garbage too
If I played me like you did I probably be dodging me too
Finna run up (?) money blowing hit you up
Damn bitch I'm rolling up, quit bouncing in the truck
Just learn how to give a fuck not
We might take off some Shottas like Teddy Bruck Shut
Nike every fucking time, never caught out of style
How about I drop a Go-Pro, whatever don't fly

[Outro]
Don't fly, La Familia
Huh, god damn y'all niggas killing us, uh
Y'all feeling us?
We gave you that swag
We gon' need that back, fuck nigga
Y'all niggas in arrears
Us niggas is ahead, okay (okay)
