She peek the way we walk, the way we talk
All that shit them be on, no we off
My niggas go to the mall they copping it all
We just going to count the money weight it up
Member them nights i was lonely a nigga didn't have shit
Bitches use to play me, treat me like an average
Member them nights i was lonely a nigga didn't have shit
Bitches use to play me, treat me like an average
These hoes be for everybody
I can't trust them (nall)

I can not turst any of these bitches they be sneakin
Say they will ride but they really leaving
All my niggas, know that they got me, yeah they riding
All my niggas get in the pen with the vibes
All my niggas riding and they with me
All my niggas riding and they with me
Counting up the money, we need plenty
Counting up the money, we need plenty
I dont fuck with these niggas
All my niggas be hitters
If you niggas test me you get hit up
And i got your bitch when you was split up

She peek the way we walk, the way we talk
All that shit them be on, no we off
My niggas go to the mall they copping it all
We just going to count the money weight it up
Member them nights i was lonely a nigga didn't have shit
Bitches use to play me, treat me like an average
Member them nights i was lonely a nigga didn't have shit
Bitches use to play me, treat me like an average
These hoes be for everybody
I can't trust them (nall)
