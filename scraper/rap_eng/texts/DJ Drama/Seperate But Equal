I just wanna stress cats, yo its just music man, for real, like it ain't even about, you know, I think the industry in a lot of ways done fucked up a lot of people minds into thinking that, you know, that the South is just one thing and that it’s just one way and when you got, you know, that the South, if it ain’t just you know just the Club music or the Crunk or whatever whatever, then that ain’t really representative of the South and a lot of people blame the South for dumbing down music or whatever, but man the thing is, like out of the South, you got some of the most open-minded and some of the most versatile MC’s because in the South, man, we grew up listening to everything so, you know, I just really want people to just focus on the music and you know say, not really so much on what these labels and what these, the radios and the TV stations be trying to feed ya’ll or what they think the South is supposed to be. The South is some of the most intelligent well-spoken and thoughtful niggas in hip-hop man and the music reflects that so it’s like, yo when you see your Little Brother hooking up with a DJ Drama don’t be surprised, real recognize real man it’s good music it’s hip-hop that’s what we here to do, that’s what we gon’ keep doin. It’s Gangster Grills, Little Brother, Separate But Equal, DJ Drama, Let’s get it, There like that man (Yeah)
