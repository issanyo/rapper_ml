[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I know you want me girl
You think about me in your mind, am I right? Yeah
I think about you too
I'm feeling right here deep inside, it's all right yeah
And you telling me things that you wanna do
And I got plans to do things too
You know I wonder why you took so long and made me have to wait
Tell me where we start

[Pre-Chorus: Rich Girl]
Let's sit down I need to kill time
Then sweep me off my feet after some wine
Slowly please undress me
I ain't even playing when I say, we starting now

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Rich Girl]
Round and round, up and down, up in this bed
I don't want you to forget
Hope you remember my perfume, on you
After I sex you down
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four
Hope you come back for more
Will you remember my perfume on you?
After I sex you down

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Rich Girl]
Tonight I'm pretty much ready
To do what you want me to, do what you want me to
Tonight I'm pretty much ready
To do what you want me to, do what you want me to yeah
In the middle of the night when I call your phone
I love it when you tell me "Come get it I'm alone"
Cause you know I can go all night
Before I leave I'ma give you bragging rights

[Pre-Chorus: Rich Girl]
Let's sit down I need to kill time
Sweep me off my feet after some wine
Slowly please undress me
I ain't even playing when I say, we starting now

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Rich Girl]
Round and round, up and down, up in this bed
I don't want you to forget
Hope you remember my perfume, on you
After I sex you down
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four
Hope you come back for more
Will you remember my perfume on you?
After I sex you down

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Rich Girl]
We can do it all over the house
It's evidence from what we did on the couch
It's on the counters in the kitchen, my love is what you missing
On every pillow and it's time to lay you down
Down on your body when you wake up
So as my lip gloss and my make-up
You can see, you cannot wait
Don't wanna escape, every time we do

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Rich Girl]
Round and round, up and down, up in this bed
I don't want you to forget
Hope you remember my perfume, on you
After I sex you down
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four
Hope you come back for more
Will you remember my perfume on you?
After I sex you down
