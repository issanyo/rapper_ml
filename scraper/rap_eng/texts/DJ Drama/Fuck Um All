[Intro: DJ Drama & Kevin McCall]
You know, this shit is really a lot of hard work man
Shit who I'm kidding man this shit too easy

But it feels great to be loved and you have the haters keep talking

Uh, fuck 'em all like a orgy
Don't remember none of they names they not important
Uh, fuck 'em all like a orgy
Don't remember none of they names they not important
Uh, fuck 'em all like a orgy
Don't remember none of they names they not important
Haters better stay in they lane I'm Jeff Gordon
Nigga I been fly, and y'all just boarding
Uh, all my shit be bumping
Fucking over niggas like we laying in a bunk bed
And I'm on the top bunk, while they on the bottom one
Hope you bought your oven mitts cause all my shit be hot as fuck
How the fuck I end up here?
Better yet, now the fuck I do it in a year
Making feel good music like I fucked you in ya ear
Pause, no homo no David Alan Grier, naw
Tell me who the fuck I'm 'posed to fear
If it's not God, cause judgement day is near
I wish I knew then what I know now
Cause nobody can judge me not even Joe Brown

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
Tell 'em fuck 'em all
Y'all know me, same ol G
I told 'em fuck 'em all, all these niggas hating on me
Cause I'm the man of the hour, yeah

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Fuck 'em all like I'm fresh out
Can't say shit cause you know what that press 'bout
Do it like I'm Gwen Stefani, give 'em no doubt
Call me commando I'm going all balls out
Pause, so the fans can applaud
Nver take a break so I'm always on call
My duty is to do this, when I do it I be killing
The sickest so I shit on everybody I be illing
Nah nigga I'm cold but that don't mean I'm chilling
Got some bad shawties and they all ready and willing
Fingers up to the world like I'm Stone Cold
Shit platinum records and I piss gold
Like a tiger in the freezer I'm a cool cat
I'm the reason why VIP in the club crack
I know you love that, so bring more bottles
And don't worry bout the tab, I got 'em

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
Tell 'em fuck 'em all
Y'all know me, same ol G
I told 'em fuck 'em all, all these niggas hating on me
Cause I'm the man of the hour, yeah

[Verse 3: Diesel]
Uh, fuck 'em all haters talk a lot
Voices in my head tell me Diesel cop a bigger yacht
The black card said go 'head buy another drop
Garage looking something like a foreign car lot
Wow, I swear I'm living like monopoly
And there's hotels on every single stitch of property
Nothing in my wallet then I'm shitting on the lottery
Ain't talking twitter when I say yo girl follow me
Give me yo Patron before I perform
Got me spitting so smooth I'm a call it Drake Ramon
I'm on right now, the ladies on with me
Acting like they love me someone give these hoes a Emmy
Fuck 'em all cause I know they all let me
Shake they whole team feel like action in a SB
Or the Heisman status on high man
How can I crash man when I'm flyer than the pilot?

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
Tell 'em fuck 'em all
Y'all know me, same ol G
I told 'em fuck 'em all, all these niggas hating on me
Cause I'm the man of the hour, yeah
