Princess’s in her bedroom window, she’s got a crush
On the guy at university of Alabama
‘cause Mr. shining armor doesn’t even exist in this
World
Worried about someone take her away from this
Nightmare

Chorus:
The moon’s is shine upon you like
A beautiful goddess
So, you been dream about your prince come
To you as well
Tell, she’s tired of all problems and she's only waiting on
A crystal Knight
( Cinderella, where are you, Cinderella)


Verse1:
She’s washing dishes again for 3 weeks, ‘cause 2 bad
Stepsister’s and one evil mother in
Law
Saw, her crying out in the rain before she seen a
Fairy godmother made
Her wish
Girlish, her dreams come true with me and her
Like dancing all night in
The ballroom




Verse2:
She didn’t care about this fairytale
She found love
Once again
Showmen, me show a beautiful and wonderful
Princess on the dance floor
Adore, she approach me with a
Gorgeous smile




Verse3:
Style, she has the most amazing beauty
All in the land
Heartland, she’s dreaming about me and her in this
Paradise
Spice, I’ll want to dance with you leaving the
Dancers in flames
Game, huntsmen told me about Royal Kingdom
To impress her and win her
Heart
