[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
It kills me to see you cry, even more when I tell a lie
And it's always something I do to you baby
And I'm so sorry for all the things that I did
And I can't say goodbye, or let you just walk away
So I'll admit my wrongs, and I hope you hear this
'Cause it's a song I made for you
And I'm hoping maybe, I can win back your heart
So please don't say goodbye, I know the love's still there somewhere

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Wish I could give the world
And I know it hurts sometimes
When you deserve the world
Nothing comes in between us
So you can never separate me from your love
Oh darling
I'm never ever letting go
'Cause I love you more than life itself

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Just want you on my team girl, and I don't give a damn about nothing else
But the way I feel with you is so amazing, yeah
If I never get to see you, oh
Then I might as well never even open my eyes
I love you so, that I can't let you go
And I ain't trying to be selfish no oh, oh
Just had to tell you, that you've got my heart
And only you can tear it apart, yeah, ooh ooh

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Wish I could give the world
And I know it hurts sometimes
When you deserve the world
Nothing comes in between us
So you can never separate me from your love
Oh darling
I'm never ever letting go
'Cause I love you more than life itself

[Bridge: Kevin McCall]
You make it easy, easy to love you
So I ain't gotta look nowhere else
I know I found the right one
Call me crazy, but I love my baby more than anything
And something's taking over
Anything you want I hand it over
I'ma ride this thing 'til the wheels fall off
'Til the end of time I'm forever yours, yours

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Wish I could give the world (oh yeah, the world)
And I know it hurts sometimes (sometimes)
When you deserve the world (woah, woah, woah, hey)
Nothing comes in between us (nothing between us)
So you can never separate me from your love (never)
Oh darling (darling)
I'm never ever letting go (no)
'Cause I love you more than life itself
Oh no, I love you more than life itself, woah
