[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Them yellow diamonds in my chain, yeah, that must mean I'm rich
Them yellow diamonds in my chain, yeah
I got them VVS especially and you know them diamonds brighter then a bitch
You know what we do and you know we shine so
Just watch 'em glitter, glitter, glitter, just watch 'em glitter
The whole room lit up, lit up, lit up, lit up, the whole room lit up
Just watch us glitter, glitter, glitter
Just watch it glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter
And I'm shining though

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
She said it’s nice to meet me, my chain is clear like Fiji
My diamonds shine in blue and red, you think that shits in 3D
Yeah, where you wanna go? Jamaica or Tahiti?
Don’t share you with no others, love the money plus I'm greedy
And it’s a piece of cake, I say cause I'm a pro
You little fake boys, it's like Pinocchio
But I'm in Tokyo, getting massages from these hoes
And you can hate but I'm just flying private on this hoes

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Them yellow diamonds in my chain, yeah, that must mean I'm rich
Them yellow diamonds in my chain, yeah
I got them VVS especially and you know them diamonds brighter then a bitch
You know what we do and you know we shine so
Just watch 'em glitter, glitter, glitter, just watch 'em glitter
The whole room lit up, lit up, lit up, lit up, the whole room lit up
Just watch us glitter, glitter, glitter
Just watch it glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter
And I'm shining though

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay, diamonds are yellow this shit look like immigrations
Stacking money to the ceiling, I'mma need a renovation
You a rhinestone shorty, your shits an imitation
Man my neck shining so bright I feel like I'm on a vacation, man
So fuck you with your outlet, outfit, you can buy mine from
Syke, I'm playing nigga this ain't out yet, silly nigga
Yellow diamonds, my neck froze, neck froze, chain heavy
I feel like my neck broke

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Them yellow diamonds in my chain, yeah, that must mean I'm rich
Them yellow diamonds in my chain, yeah
I got them VVS especially and you know them diamonds brighter then a bitch
You know what we do and you know we shine so
Just watch 'em glitter, glitter, glitter, just watch 'em glitter
The whole room lit up, lit up, lit up, lit up, the whole room lit up
Just watch us glitter, glitter, glitter
Just watch it glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter
And I'm shining though
