[Intro: Tory Lanez & DJ Drama]
Yeah, new you

[Verse]
Shot one of my closest niggas over nothin'
Overheard discussions, niggas talk about it
Try to be the greatest, sell a billion records
Standin' right with God is the best way of goin' ‘bout it
Think it’s time I take this time to give them blessings
Niggas stressin'
Niggas can't see the situation they gettin' blessed in
Came a ways from, robbin' niggas with them Smith and Wessons
Gotta understand, shows sellin' out, hoes yellin' out
Far from my coke shootin', dope sellin' routes
I kicked it with niggas there was no tellin' 'bout
Some Armenian thugs that blow melons out
I used to play the corner while niggas was playin' on it
I had to stay informed and study, just playin' dormant
Back when I was tryin' to set the plan with Jay and Lawrence
I knew I was 'bout to be major
But fuck it, that’s just a page in the booklet
He’s just the name and the story
You gotta pay your respects, I had to pay it in glory
I would play the block slow 'til the corner block corner shop closed
And play the slots in the winter until I’m snot nosed
Abandoned bastard, I was stranded
I guess that was the cards that I was handed
Sleepin' in the back of broken vans and lands
With both hands inside my lane, yeah nigga, that’s just where I landed
Campin' out was always standin' out
I was that nigga that done branched out
I was that nigga so I’ve spoken ‘bout
The brand that these niggas that got focused, they had they hands out
