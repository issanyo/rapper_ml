[Intro: Chris Brown]
Drama, what you doing?
Nigga why you mad? You know we bullshitting
I like my cars how I like my broads, top missing
Made from the liquor and faces full of DNA
And me and Sean came to party, so it's TNA

[Interlude: DJ Drama]
Hold up CB, now Chris came to me and said
"Drama, let's do In My Zone 2"
I said "Heck, work the album though, what you doing?"
He said "All this, we just bullshitting"
You know why? We in our zone baby, shoutout to Big Sean

[Verse: Chris Brown]
Nigga why you mad? You know we bullshitting
I like my cars so I like my broad's top missing
Made from the liquor and faces full of DNA
And me and Sean came to party, so it's TNA
I go to war for that money, I'm a green beret
I got that cash flow, nigga I just need to save
Call me Birdman, flock full of chickens
What you doing, I'm bullshitting
You get paid, no never mind
Cause by the time you see me
Been seeing your girl like hella times
And she might say your name but she yelling mine
You a sucker, you a lame, I'm a veteran
I do my thing, dirty dirty
I'mma be the reason why they acting flirty
1:30 kinda early, they calling me Tiger cause I'm getting birdies
And I'm a birdman, whole flock of chickens
Nigga what you doing? Bullshitting
Nigga hold up, the track done blowed up
My flow sick as shit, I think I throwed up
What up my nigga Sean? We rocking all these ladies
And we responsible for after the show, all these babies
You know it's G.O.O.D. music, CBE I do do it
Poo poo on that track and I be shitting on them vomit fluid
Call a coroner, nigga good riddance
What you doing boy?
