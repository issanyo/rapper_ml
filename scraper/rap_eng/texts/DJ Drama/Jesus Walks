[Intro]
I just guess I hate when people take advantage of people's
Lack of understanding of the true nature
Of what our relationship with the creator is supposed to be?
You know what I'm saying?
At the end of the day man humans are humans
We're all just people
No person walking this Earth could judge you
(Jesus walks)
And all y'all fake preachers use God to get money man
Is gonna come back to you
As a matter of fact, I think that is what i am about to start with

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if it offend
But i got something to say
Most of these preachers are still (niggas) at the end of the day
Most of these preachers are still (niggas) at the end of the day
Shit these preachers are still (niggas) at the end of the day
While we're all searching and seeking
We're looking, striving for guidance
Men try to divide us, the answers come from inside us
People so judgmental, I don't listen to that!
Like God gon' send you to hell just cause you listen to rap
That's some man made up to try and keep us apart
Who really care how you dress, God knows what's on your heart
See we lettin'em separate us, control us, manipulate us
Said money's the root of evil, imprint its name on the paper
Cause you put on a suit, you think you're holy every hour
We all got a past, you're acting like you're holier than thou
Just cause I make a mistake, don't mean I God don't love me
It just mean that I'm human and only God could judge me

[Interlude]
(Jesus walks)
God, show me the way because the devil try to break me down
(Jesus walks)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
And I don't think it's nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus walks)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid, cause we ain't spoke in so long
Who hasn't done wrong?
Let he who is without sin cast the first stone
Blinded by the ignorance at times we fail to see the beauty in each other
All beliefs, all colors, we are all sisters and brothers
We all will stand in judgement
But not to the public, not to the people that do the same evil
And think they have something to gain from it, no
When we are confronted, we're lovin'
It will be by the most high
Ironic that we will see the whole truth when we have closed eyes
Cause love is spiritual, Unconditional
It knows no bounds, it has no ups or downs
It just is

[Verse 2]
If we know that everybody is our brother
Let's try to better each other
Instead of turning our nose, acting like we're better than each other
So no matter what race, creed, color or religion
Sinnin' is sinnin' and that ain't a matter of opinion
Instead of arguing over religion, debating what it might mean
Let's focus on what really matter, and that's doing the right thing
So before you judge that lil girl in them tight jeans
Try talking to her instead of chastising because just what she might need
Is guidance, and you could be the one to provide it
Lack of communication got generations divided
And ain't nobody perfect if you ain't make it to service
As long as you worship and gave thanks, God heard it
I just hate when they're trying to misinform us, to separate us
When the focus should be giving thanks to the one who made us
And no, I ain't no preacher, but a speaker of the house
I'm just the people's rapper, love God and speaking out

(Jesus walk)
(Jesus walk with me, with me, with me...)
