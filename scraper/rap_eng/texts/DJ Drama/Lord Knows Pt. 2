[Intro]
You see, the thing about it is, we used to be them lil niggas
Now we just them niggas

[Hook]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bendin' off the corner, whippin' out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But I ain't gon' lose when I came from the bottom
Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows

[Verse 1]
Niggas can lie but The Lord knows
Guiseppe and diamond, my wardrobe
I hop out the leer with my diamonds and cutlasses
My new resolution is stay the fuck away from fuck niggas
Ain't even drivin' 'em back
She come with the team, then she's stuck with us
I might buy a foreign
I'm thinkin' the plate should say, "Nigga Keep Up With Us"
Niggas gon' hate but they know I'm big homie
Ain't gotta know nothin' to know that it's somethin'
Now droppin' the bass when they see the big homie, drop it
I'm flooded, they with it, bitch you can bet it for sure

[Hook]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bendin' off the corner, whippin' out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But I ain't gon' lose when I came from the bottom
Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows

[Verse 2]
I walk in the bank and the teller call me Mr. Peterson
The diamonds all up in my Rollie, tell her we gon' meet again
Any time that my baby catch me with a chick I say, "She a friend"
Ironic, I came to the club and my jacket was cheetah skin
All of the real niggas come from Toronto
Niggas'll send you away
Goin' OT to kill you, then come back tomorrow
Woah, this a dirty game in here
He'll be a dead man walkin'
If he ever wear 30 chains in here
I ain't talkin' 'bout French Montana
Have to worry 'bout everything in there
Man niggas tryna take my soul
Pray the Lord that I make my dough
What it's lookin' like?
Pull up in all the big bodies
My whips are nothin' but exotics
My bitches all got the body
I got the Four in the party
Ara, don't make me call my nigga Karo
Ara, my Armenians fly from Fargo, woah

[Interlude]
Look nigga, I don't know what the fuck they told you. This Fargo shit for real. I don't play no games, they been hatin' on me since I was 'bout 8, nigga, shinin'. Designer this, designer that. Hoes see me, niggas jealous, bitches pissed. I ain't this, I ain't that. Shit, y'all niggas just mad I do my motherfuckin' thing and I'm beautiful when I do it, nigga. Ayo Bri, tell these niggas I'm the Balenciaga Bastard, nigga, shinin' with Giuseppes, every color Margielas like Starburst, nigga. I'm done. Fargo

[Hook]

But I ain't gon' lose when I came from the bottom
Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows
