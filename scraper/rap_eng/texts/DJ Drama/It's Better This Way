[Hook]
It’s better this way
You don’t really like what they play
On the radio every single day
It’s better this way
Ain’t no telling when it’s gon' change
Cause they all really say the same things
It’s better this way
If you looking for some original soul
I know where you should go
It’s better this way
Better this way
It’s better this way
You don’t really like what they play
On the radio every single day
It’s better this way
Ain’t no telling when it’s gon' change
Cause they all really say the same things
It’s better this way
If you looking for some original soul
I know where you should go
It’s better this way

[Verse 1]
It’s that, It’s that Krit remind you of that shit
You used to play
In your parents car
Had you feel in as if outer space
Was in your atmosphere
ATLiens all in your ear
Tired of being outcasted
I hope that means you outta here
Nowadays we flex so much
Get a check so much
We never chill
Way to drunk to drive
High as fuck
Plus we poppin pills
Celebrate the very shit
That slow us down and probably kill
Song ain’t even jamming though
Number one in every ville
Got that on repeat
Right before you wake
On your way to work
On your way to church
Stuck in traffic
Right before you go to sleep
I know you tired
Of that overdrive
That commercialized sing along
Wonder why they play this song all the time

[Hook]
It’s better this way
You don’t really like what they play
On the radio every single day
It’s better this way
Ain’t no telling when it’s gon' change
Cause they all really say the same things
It’s better this way
If you looking for some original soul
I know where you should go
It’s better this way

[Verse 2]
I didn’t know about you till you recognized
It wasn’t paid for or televised by the label
You couldn’t see it all on cable or
Advertised at award shows
I didn't beef with none your favorite rappers
Or drop a sex tape after
Claiming it leaked off of my cellphone
When really I’m tryin' to sell more
And I wouldn’t just say anything
On the radio just to get fame
Or trap it out, gangster rap it out
Knowin' I ain’t never sold a thang
Bust a dime on the coffee table
Really shorty I went to school
I wasn’t friends with the son
Of the executive that ran the label
I had to pay dues
Wasn’t no blueprint where I come from
I couldn’t blow up in the backyard
Couldn’t walk the streets with my Cd
Give it to a DJ, like that's hard
And he play it everyday 'till I got a deal
Album date and advanced tour
My takeover wasn’t overnight
To be honest with you, it was a gift from god

[Hook]
It’s better this way
You don’t really like what they play
On the radio every single day
It’s better this way
Ain’t no telling when it’s gon change
Cause they all really say the same things
It’s better this way
If you looking for some original soul
I know where you should go
It’s better this way
It’s better this way
