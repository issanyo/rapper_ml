[Tyga]
Its Tyga
No lion
I'm eating
No Diner
This species
Don't diet
Every milla fish Friday
I'm Squad deep
Like them white guy from Verizon
Gator righteous
So its only right you meet the fugitive
John Mcgiver
Teenager
School cyphers
I was too nicer
Than them no license
You gets no high-fivin'
Nigga, Roll the damn dices
Touch
My word play
2 shades from the color gray
My kick game so unreal
They say them colors must be fake
Never been made
MTV, I make
Quake your very eyesight
My fame's no mistake
Since the deal
Steak dinner everyday
For the movie
My life is like a Compton Play
You can see it
Nearly breathe it
From a couple feet away
But stay away
Cuz I don't
Get along
With them tag-along
Let me
Get on a song
Period gone
I'm off the hook like cordless phones
My identity so right
They think its wrong
G.E.D. Young Money
Finish strong, so I'm a keep goin'
My ligaments covered in green like general symbols on my face
Like my skin was leather made
Leatherman Louis
You ain't never seen
Like a nun booty
None before me
After
Its only boys
Tyga man
I do it for the hatin' homies
