You see, we're really not much for warnings
Around these parts, we just like to come straight at ya
But as you can tell, I think you are getting the message

[Verse 1: Cassper Nyovest]
Yeah, greetings from up in the North, I heard these niggas is talking
You never talk to me direct, I just got a call from your bosses
Say you started from bottom was rolling around in a Toyota bakkie?
Some of us started with nothing so we consider you lucky (Ew!)
You always on Twitter my nigga, where do you find all the time?
Man this boy was born in December, that means the summer is mine
Tried to be humble but niggas I'm fed up
I just got a text from Julius Malema
I'm probably gon' hit him back in a second
But right now my fingers is doing the hella (hey!)
Making the most, pocketela hundred stena a show
At an average of 5 shows a week
Ooh, ooh re le direla jiti
I heard you niggas is talking bout me, I heard you niggas is talking bout me
Tse tswembu, tse tswembu

[Verse 2: Cassper Nyovest]
Greetings from up in the South, I hope they play this shit loud
I sold out the dome with a tweet, I run the world from my couch
Niggas still wanna compete, why o sa shebe taba tsao?
Used to be 20,000 for a show, now it's 20,000 in the crowd
Nna le manyora a ka re le direla nywe nywe nywe nywe
Ska tla go mbora baba atumela ka chelete fela
Me and my niggas want money that's all, money that's all
Young niggas do it themselves, shoutout to Culoe De Song (Blind!)

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Nah, you keep all that
You know what I mean

But I know we got now
Cassper, fuck with me!
