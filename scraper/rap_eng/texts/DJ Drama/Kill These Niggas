[Intro : T-Pain & DJ Drama]
Dam ba dum, Dam ba dum
It's so sad...
Wake up in the morning, with some real strange on my mind..
It's so sad... (Trendsetter)
Wake up in the morning, with some real strange on my mind..
It's just kinda natural, I got a tenancy to bury these niggas
I've been classify as I serial killer for quite some time...

[Verse 1]
Wake up in the morning, with some real strange on my mind...
Call me a murderer, that just send chills up my spine, my spine
Cause I know I'm a beast in the streets
And all this hate that I receive
Make me wanna eat them up like they my dinner
When all this tension get release, they stay away from me
But I got to let them know
That they fucking with a winner
I don't know what to do, and I don't know what to say, say
Cause I'm pretty much like you
Except you know I don't play, play
Hey, and my blood lust always gets in the way

[Chorus]
I don't fear these niggas
I don't feel these niggas
Everytime I look in the mirror
I say boy, I'ma kill these niggas
I say boy, I'ma kill these niggas
I say boy, I'ma kill these niggas
I say boy, I'ma kill these niggas (serial killer)
I say boy, I'ma kill these niggas

[Outro : DJ Drama ]
(Sylvester Stallone talking)
I mean you think that’s right?
I mean maybe you’re doing your job but why you gotta stop me from doing mine?
Cause if you’re willing to go through all the battling you got to go through to get where you want to get, who’s got the right to stop you?
I mean maybe some of you guys got something you never finished, something you really want to do, something you never said to someone, something…
And you’re told no, even after you paid your dues? Who’s got the right to tell you that, who? Nobody!
It’s your right to listen to your gut, it ain’t nobody’s right to say no after you earned the right to be where you want to be and do what you want to do!…
