[Intro]
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me
Bitch, shut the fuck up when you talk to me

[Verse 1]
Call me Mr. Never Ever Have A Car Rented
I pull up to the dealer, buy any car in it
Bitches sayin', "Aw yeah" 'cause I'm Authentic
Gotta make 100 more, yeah 'cause I'm gon' get it
Motherfucker stylish, I be shoppin' in Thailand
Women takin' pictures like a nigga hop out the fire
Tryna get paper like niggas made it up out of college
Yo chick be on my dick, I ball like a set of eye lids
I just be like pull up you bitches, hoodlums and bullet shit pictures
Y'all wanna fuck with a nigga, pushups and pullups you bitches
And I'm top down gettin' top down
Cops comin', had to tell em put the top down
Bet that get from the gettin', that CAD representin'
That DAB tryna get me, go fetch this weed that we're givin'
I be that nigga you notice, so shit these bitches the notice
Bitches of mixin' the moment, pictures yo bitch when I'm bonin'

[Pre-Chorus]
And the whole room full of drugs
Whole corner niggas camouflaged
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me
Bitch, shut the fuck up when you talk to me

[Chorus]
I'm fuckin' awesome
I'm fuckin' awesome
I'm fuckin' awesome

[Interlude]
Come on nigga, you won't beat me up nigga, you just BMW nigga. The fuck wrong with you? My bitch don't push my buttons, nigga. The only buttons she push is the ones that stole them cars, nigga

[Verse 2]
Could tell you all you need to know, I'm gon' say
I've never got dropped, had to drop ('You can't handle the truth')
You ain't want to flex, I got people on the Tecs
Swavey on the T's, got the sneakers comin' next
Just so I can ball, I went and bought me a Rawling, nigga
Gettin' closer to gold and weigh up out of this song
Play like you got that hate like when we be cakin' in Jordans
Niggas hatin', ain't no fuckin' talkin' in this star, nigga
You don't wanna fuck around, get your life tooken
Uh uh fuck around, get your wife tooken
Black Phanton in the night lurkin'
Like a black plane with a flight bookin'
Okay, I just bought a Rollie, plus the Phantom and parolies
Niggas yeah, they can't stand, I'm on the man, they wanna know me
Holy Bible by my bed, I keep that rifle by my head
Niggas find me, I'm gon' let it through, I'm grimey on the grit and that for real, nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
And the whole room full of drugs
Whole corner niggas camouflaged
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me
Bitch, shut the fuck up when you talk to me

[Chorus]
I'm fuckin' awesome
I'm fuckin' awesome
I'm fuckin' awesome

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin', nigga? Niggas can't fuck with us, just hatin' ass niggas so we fuck. I got a Persian rug for every bad bitch I got. Fuck is wrong with you niggas, man? Canada
