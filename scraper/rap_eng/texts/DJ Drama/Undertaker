[Intro: DJ Drama]
Y'all niggas really thought we wasn't gonna do it again?
Come on man, grand Hustle nigga, you know what it is
T.I.P, DJ the fuck Drama, Young Dro, Young Buck
I said P-$-C-what's-happenin'-nigga

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Yo Khao!
I'm a pimp type, nigga ridin' clean after midnight
Ready for the gun play, prepared for a fist fight
Roll up on yo bitch and ask her what that pussy hit like
First she acting funny, in a minute she gon' get right
Get down, got her fuckin' with another bitch now
I'm king of all that I survey, remember this is T.I.P. town
Hey, you ain't ready? pussy nigga better sit it down
We Mac-90, rock steady nigga spit rounds
Turn yo stomach to spaghetti when it hit the ground
Toss the choppers in the Chevy, then we mashing down Campbellton counting all your Benjamins and Hamiltons
As far I'm concerned you just a job for the janitors
Don't disregard I'mma God you a amateur
Hide behind ya bodyguards and ya manager
I pimp hard throughout all the pages in the calendar
Bitch it's Pimp Squad: all action no cameras

[Hook x 2: ALL]
You know what it is, you know what it do
And you know what it is, and you know what it do
You know what it is, you know what it do
And you know what it is, and you know what it do
Shorty we bury niggas, shorty we bury niggas
Shorty we bury niggas, shorty we bury niggas
The undertaker

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Hey, stand in on the trap with me
Mention me is blasphemy, 1000 round magazine
My partnas say no attackin' me
I'm aged to the average beef, respiratory crushin beats
Fruit Chevy H.I.C, my lyrics hit like HIV
Spray by me, Sniper Dro, murder come today by me
Bullet chip yo L I P and dirty all yo H I Ps
Shot both of yo homies, now they feedin' them through a I.V
The tray I be from the west side, where they say I be
May I be the ruler over all that I survey I be
Laid back, yay's black, triple kiwi Maybach
Weed match the Benz, kush triple kiwi 80 pack
Old school baby crack. I'm tryin' to bring the 80's back
Haitians get me Haiti crack, plus my momma hated crack
'Til we got a evicted and I came through with them 80 stacks
Play it back, rewind where I live
I'm a zone 3 hustla, niggas know what it is

[Hook x 2]

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
May we all bow our heads and pray for this nigga
The undertaker's comin' any day for this nigga
They hate him in the hood, for the dreams he been sellin'
I read the paperwork and it seems you was tellin'
You know what it is and you know who I'm talkin' bout
When the feds came, I didn't open up my mouth
What you scared fo'? niggas know you been a ho
It's like....homey shit was all good just a week ago
Get the goons ready, start up your vehicle
And shoot at any fuckin' car you ain't seen before
Pick up the shells if ya use a automatic
They gave 50 years to my nigga Lil' Travis
Set a booby-trap, let him trip over the wires
Then he gon' be laying....right by the preacher and the choir
And if u catch him 'fore I do, T.I. go and handle yo biz
When you see me holla at me homie, you know what it is

[Hook x 2]
