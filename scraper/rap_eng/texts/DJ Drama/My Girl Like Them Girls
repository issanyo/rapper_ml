[Verse 1: J Valentine]
Let me start off by saying, baby don't go both ways
She don't mind flirting and playing, at least that's what she say
Got off in the spot and I'm tripping, she knows baby girl's first name
Could it be something I'm missing, or am I just part of the game?

[Pre-Chorus: J Valentine]
Woah woah, she getting more change than the players
Woah woah, she putting fingers up to the haters
Woah woah, way she do it it look so good
Like I said she don't go both ways, but this is making me wish she would

[Chorus: J Valentine]
My girl like them girls, it's alright it's okay
My girl like them girls, it's alright it's okay
So I let her let her do her thing, I even let her make it rain
My girl like them girls, she like them girls, oh yeah
Didn't know that she liked them girls
Didn't know she

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Number one fantasy on my list, I even did it once in my dream
Ooh that damn m√©nage, could it really be happening?
Baby how you gon' tease me, tucking dollars all between your thighs
Ooh that girl got it, you should make an exception tonight

[Pre-Chorus: J Valentine]
Woah woah, she getting more change than the players
Woah woah, she putting fingers up to the haters
Woah woah, way she do it it look so good
Like I said she don't go both ways, but this is making me wish she would

[Chorus: J Valentine]
My girl like them girls, it's alright it's okay
My girl like them girls, it's alright it's okay
So I let her let her do her thing, I even let her make it rain
My girl like them girls, she like them girls, oh yeah
Didn't know that she liked them girls
Didn't know she

[Bridge: J Valentine & Chris Brown]
She liked the one with the tattooed thighs, I think they call her Sunshine
And if she wanna cross the light, I don't care
Cause ain't nobody gotta know, and we can keep it on the low
And if you wanna take her home, we can share

[Chorus: J Valentine]
My girl like them girls, it's alright it's okay
My girl like them girls, it's alright it's okay
So I let her let her do her thing, I even let her make it rain
My girl like them girls, she like them girls, oh yeah
Didn't know that she liked them girls
Didn't know she
