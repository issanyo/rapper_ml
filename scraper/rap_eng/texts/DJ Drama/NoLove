Never give your heart to a hoe (Mhmm)

Nobody there, the money right there (Ahh Ahh Ahh Ahh Ahh)
You was right there when no one was there (Mhmm)
I cannot lie, this shit was unfair (Ahh Ahh Ahh Ahh Ahh)
Walk in the room and everyone stare (Mhmm)

[Yung Tory:]
Where was you?

[Lil Durk:]
Why you be messing with me
Why you be stressing to me
Why you finesse for the D
Your friends be messaging me
Tell em' stop messing' with me
Why you investing than me
You cheap
That second degree
That's just a lesson for me
When I was down
You wasn't checkin' for me
You was not checkin' for me
Got arrested stripper Magic
She know where cash is
(Yeah yeah yeah)
She love my eye lids
I'm a savage
Matching Rollies got a bunch of them
Wanna a baby fuck the rubber shit
She was always on some other shit
That's why I don't ever love a bitch
Like ya shawty

Always get into it shawty
Count that check and get in to it shawty
These hoes they for everybody
