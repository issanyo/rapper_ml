[Verse 1: Maino]
I don’t need no model girl
I don’t need no rap chick
I don’t want no singing broad
I don’t want no actress!
Got myself a bad bitch
Baby girl is super bad
Different kind of retail v on her louie bag
I'm her one and only
She is my fiancee 
Drop dead gorgeous
A little neighborhood Beyonce
Shoes like Beyonce
Hoppin out her pearl bed
Tattoos belly ring, That’s my type of girlfriend!
She’s the type of girl I like
I see it in my future!
Told me that her baby dad’s a loser
She’s been with the boosters
She independent so I choose her
Look at her, I don’t wanna lose her

[Verse 2: Maino]
I don’t want no diva chick
I don’t want no pushy blonde
I don’t need a social life
I don’t need a movie star
Got myself a Gucci star
Baby girl is on me
I can tell, everytime she calls me, always…
Got herself an attitude
You don’t want her mad at you
Love her cause she all about a dolla too
First time that I saw her
She was with with tuana and latoya
Knew right there that I just wanted to spoil her
Never hollywood yo
My pretty baby from the hood, yo!
She really make me feel good, though
Look at what I gave her, never play her, maintain her
She’ll never leave me for no football player

[Verse 3: Maino]
I don’t need a silly chick
I don’t need a phony cat
I don’t want a crazy bitch
I don’t like the [?]
Got myself a ghetto dime
Baby you got me opened!
Sandals in the summertime
Uggs when it’s snowing
Keep her in a beamer, in a wife beater
She looks so delicious I could eat her!
Told me that she missed me
Felt her lip gloss when she kissed me
Please lord don't let my baby diss me!
