[Verse 1]
Yeah, look, I got my first job at 17 years old
Worked at Gregaros in that plaza out on Linden Road
Dishwasher trying not to slip on fucking soap
Walk through the kitchen, slipped and burnt my arm on the fucking stove
Long as I make my lil' money, shit was beautiful
Just trying to make some bread to get equipment for my studio
Never gave a fuck about a job that wasn't music
But if it help with my hustle, I'm like fuck it, I'ma do it
Boss yelling at me, like I give a fuck
Look, while he's screaming, I'm day dreaming about the day that I'ma live it up
Hated every minute, cashing checks and breaking dishes
Other niggas feel like this what they want to do for a living
Hell naw, I'd rather starve than work this hard for another man
Slave every month and barely bring home a couple grand
I used to want to spaz and show my ass ya'll, I swear to God
Music was my passion and this was just a fucking job

[Bridge]
I mean you know what I'm saying
I was just a young nigga, just trying to, just trying to get my money
Ya know, I ain't want too much, man
Just catch me some bitches at the expo
Ya know, hit Pirate's Park up, ya know what I'm saying?

[Verse 2]
My second job, I was 20 and it wasn't about the money
I was moving to Orlando and I couldn't leave with nothing
I filled out an application at Big John's Steak and Onion
Week later, called me back, I'm like here we go, fuck it
Now this job was worst than the first
My boss was a bitch who used to stress all the time about how I was stocking the chips
I told her I would do better like and to told her to suck my dick
And the loser that worked the grill was a racist and full of shit
The whole staff like it's life or death over fast food
Every morning saying short prayers in the bathroom
Lord, please tell me you know I don't wanna be here
The faster I get money then the faster I can leave here
Put a smile on your face, do it for the team's sake
They hated that I had a dream outside of flipping cheese steak
Always tried to deter me saying no way I could beat the odds
Music was my passion, that was just a fucking job

[Bridge]
I mean I couldn't stand that bitch, man
I'm talking about for real
I remember I used to be like drawing like lil' lil' all varsity logos and shit on the back of receipts in my spare time
This bitch told me not to do that because it was making the other workers feel like my mind wasn't on the job
Bitch, my mind not on the job, what the fuck you talking about?

[Verse 3]
The last job I ever had, waited a month for them to call me back
Moving to Miami figure working at this [out to plan to help me get some bread before I leave?]
The end result of that was stress, stress and more fucking stress, yeah all of that
Boss' name was Victor and he thought rapping was a mockery
He made himself feel better at meetings by fucking mocking me
Possibly, did he think his words was really stopping me
Saying, I'm trying to look out for you brother
But got it out for me, fuck paint, fuck drilling, was thinking about a million
I don't belong in this place, have you ever had that feeling
I respect my co-workers because they had to feed their children
But that just wasn't for me and Victor saw that and it killed him
Young nigga with ambition, taking everything he's dishing
That was all I heard, but was strong enough not to listen
Donielle called me cause she seen me on the TV spittin'
And all she could say was damn yon you really did it

[Outro]
HA! Now let's be clear man
It is nothing wrong with any of these occupations, I'm rapping about
I'm just saying if that's not what the fuck you wanna do
Do NOT let these mother fuckers guilt trip you into doing some shit you gonna hate for the rest of your life
Chase your dream don't let nothing stop you
Shit, that's what I did, I'm living proof, and I'm from Flint Michigan, and if I can do it, any of ya'll can do it
Straight up, man, ain't no excuses, excuses is useless, I mean that shit
If you don't wanna do it, quit that mother fucking job immediately, nigga
Fore you fucking look around and it's 20 years later, nigga
And you wondering how the fuck you got gray hairs with THESE mother fuckers
Now what I'm saying?
