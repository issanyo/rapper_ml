[Intro: La the Darkman]
Aww, yeah
L.A.D.!

[Verse 1: La the Darkman]
I'm all about that cheese, swiss or mozerella
Muenster, Colby, American or cheddar
When it come to robbery, nobody do it better
Notorious L.A.D., fresh Coogi sweater
The cleanest, lyrics is the meanest
Understand my English, nigga I'm a genius
Ice like a snow cone, writin' in my iPhone
Went from sellin' crack to sellin' ringtones
Straight out the projects to million dollar homes
Inside the Carter, cookin' 36 zones
36 O's and I break them all down
In and out of every trap, all through the A-town
The Embassy A.M.G, Young Money merger
I'm a Young Champ Like Ben Roethlisberger
S.S. Chevy with the big block engine
Rims and paint cost me a whole pension

[Verse 2:Jae Millz]
I don't need none but my niggas and enough weed to go around
A tinted sedan, some grams and a loaded pound
Fuck what another nigga think of me
I'm thinkin' multi-millions, he thinkin' Gs
Nigga please, get your mind right
Fuck tryna be fresh, get your grind right
Cuz I'm like, so in another league
I throw my pitches at different degrees
And I spiril my pigskins at different speeds
And I hit threes cuz at different times I release
My shot cold, nigga, I'm hot, don't be tight cuz you not
Just be happy I'm lettin' you breathe
I'm the good, I'm the bad, I'm the devil, I'm Jesus
It's Young Money, bitch, the game needs us
Gudda Gudda, what it is nigga?
Kidd-Kidd, Chi, get it how you live nigga
My nigga Mack Maine just left the dealership
And Weezy just ripped the drop Phantom so they feelin' sick
Diamond rings, diamond chains, royal suites, private planes
Palm trees, big change, I can't complain
I made a promise to myself that I'll never be have-not
Nigga fuck being broke, shit
Before that day come, I'll A.K. stamp ya
When there's beef, I'm in the center like Tyson Chandler
Fuck what you heard, in the booth I goes off
Like the lights if you ain't payin' us the third
And you already two months late witcha bill
Clown nigga you's a lame, bitch nigga, I'm Millz
Young Moola

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
If you didn't, now you know
It's the million-dollar nigga with the million-dollar flow
Icicle chain got a million dollar glow
Quarter mill for the gang if you tryna book a show
Temp plates on the Bentley, ridin' through the 'jects
Got a pocket full of money nigga, Hand on my tech
I'm demandin' respect, I'm a man to respect
Disrespect your man, put my hand 'round his neck
Its no other than Gudda Gudda man
Still bout my money nigga, fuck another man
I'm on the paper chase, all about the hustle man
I be climbin' through your window like I'm fucking Bruh Man
Look, I'm Shady/Aftermath, put your head in a scope (Interscope)
A bank roll with bucks is what these young niggas killin' for
The game dirty on the streets tryna deal Yayo
Fifty clips at his hat leave a peeled potato

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I call my nina bay like San Diego
Get me twisted and I'm a turn into a tornado
And all my riders ridin' like a Winnebago
You stay, but I'ma let that A.K. go
Rawer than a qualo, shoot you like Halo, give ya ass a halo
These bitches walk around actin like they J.Lo
But man, I remember when these bitches was just "hey, ho"
Hey ho, how you doing? Me, I'm doing every fuckin' thang
Smokin' them dykes, I'm on that Mary fucking Jane
This shit so Tom and Jerry to Lil Wayne
And you MC's are just milk and cherries to Lil Wayne, ha
And bitch I'm greedy
But if I keep eatin' you rappers, I'll get sugar-diabetes
Sweetie, I'm a different species
I'll crush your two fingers into a million pieces
What the fuck do I be thinkin?
Kill, kill, murder and Benjamin Franklin
Your girlfriend is into them gangstas
And me being a gangsta, I get into your girlfriend
I stay still when the world spins
And ain't nobody flyer than the Birdman
You heard me? You heard him? Him being me
And we are better than all you y'all bitches, niggas, hoes
Enemies, foes, threes, twos, ones
But these dudes won

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Won
The South, for real
Shout out the Dunk Ryders
Spcial shoutout that red flag
All the time
Young Moola, baby
