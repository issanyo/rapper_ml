[Verse 1: B.G.]
In my city nigga life like a chess game
Uptown anybody could be next mane
I switch lanes on em
Reverse the game on em
Its a must to stay a couple of steps ahead on em
Ive been out shit
Survived the worst shit
I mean i was really on some heat first shit
Stalked a nigga put him on a t shirt shit
Then go to the funeral and carry the herse shit
Yeah its real in the field nigga and what
I still hustle shine and get my sex up
I still grind fuck em what ima slack what
They pop drama but they bounce right back uh

[Chorus: B.G.]
Gotta get that money gotta get that
Gotta get that money gotta get that
Gotta get that money gotta get that
You know where the licks at nigga where the bricks at

[verse 2: Soulja slim]
I'm ridin in cars straight from the factory, or straight from the showroom
I'm in that hatch back, on a dro run
12 in the engin, nigga, you know where I'm goin
To the carwash, I was broke, Imma show m
Hundred carrots on the arm, hundred carots on the charm
Try the lifestyle if you want, you don't have to leave them harmed
How could I see you brothers, I'm in a new thang, sittin on peanut butter
I need supper, easy for me to say
My team, we get double
Se mee in the other thing, in that pink Carraira
Lean in my rear view set, cause I have to see
The red lights like the tairorests, they after me

[Chorus: B.G.]
Gotta get that money gotta get that
Gotta get that money gotta get that
Gotta get that money gotta get that
You know where the licks at nigga where the bricks at

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
Nigga, you know how I do
Look at me, I look at you
Ridin in the escolade, I'm ridin in an escolade too
Playa, fuck your 24s, I chuck up duces
Fuck with me, I use this baby Uzi
Mono wasn't real, I think you trippin, let me proove it
Hoes say I blaze it with m, but she gone off that X
Bitch, pop this here
Fuck me to death, think of me 2 weeks later
That pussy get wet
Bitch, you been poppin, you's a pill poppin hoe
She say she like slow motion, she want me to fuck her slow
I tap on that ass, three times for the third
No, I keep it real for my my niggas, my nerves
Na, never give a fuck, and that visionary told me
Baby daddy get dipped in that whip, worth 40
I told that pussy nigga when I see him on the street
Imma kick him in his ass, knock out his fuckin teath

[Chorus: B.G.]
Gotta get that money gotta get that
Gotta get that money gotta get that
Gotta get that money gotta get that
You know where the licks at nigga where the bricks at
