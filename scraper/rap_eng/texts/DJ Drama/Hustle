Ayo beloved I need my money right now (BOSS OF ALL BOSSES)
You got 2 minutes (DIPSET)
2 minutes? a bitch nigga

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Thats what mami said and ms barbra
Catch that crackhead, hurry up, pitch harder(PAY ATTENTION)
When the Mopeds had the kickstarter (GANGSTA)
I was over the stove they said it hit harder
Then she looked at me
And asked me [do you know how to hustle?]
Then told me to (hustle)
Ya'mean?
My baby mams, She dont fight fair
I got dreams I said to her they sound like nightamres bitch
This ain't Elm street but you look like freddy kruger
You know Ja, broke ass steady loser
She becomin crazy, lazy. Me? I'm numb and hazy
Knew a few 'ricans that want to rabi she the one that made me
Straight gurus
So i maneuver with some booter shooter coke and 8 shooters caught to make movers
Made to move winners we hate losers
We weaved every tap, canine, state troopers
Cuz we're something that you're not they spun like the the four tops
Brought the white out call me clorx
2 Ls four blocks
Welfare hell yea
Healthcare hell no
Ho? who the hell cares
You can sell here
Your white would do well here
Sour, you smell here
Hustle? hell yea...
(GANGSTA GRILLZ)
Thats what my father and my uncle said..

Daddy looked at me and asked me
Then told me..

Uncle ted her 19th son 24th and lennox

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
My hood I love
I eat, I thug
I beep my plug , Javi got me
Call me gordito, i get doritos
Packaged like fritos I act so frio
Fuck your camaro
Maybach or lambo
Life is a gamble
My Nikes on the gravel
Dice in my palm
Money's my thoughts
I pray so long, He sees my faults
I cease to floss, I seen the states
Growin the boss, cleaning my face

[Verse 3: Vado]
Day and night, Weighin white, Breakin white, Make it right
Tissued out, Listen out, Father don, Late at night
Kitchen hot, sittin pot, lift the rock, place the ice
Need connects, street respect, asked them out, paid the price
Outta town, island town, filled them in, killed them men
Ride around, makin' rounds, 50 them 50 them
Like rich la Frince and Jay, kevin chows, cam'ron jaows [?]
Dougie fresh get it straight
