Katt Williams:
Is this Cottin Candy Cush, or is this Urkel's gift?
Oh this is ?
Imma blow it into the speaker, see if you can get high
I like weed, and all of it's possible variations
I like it in a blunt, I like it in a joint, I like a volcaino, where it's in a big ass bag, like a hot air baloon
And you just take a little, take a little, take a little ho
That shit is so cold
But you know, don't really matter to me, I do it in one of those little glass pipes too
If I'm fucken with some of my white friends, I'll get the motherfuckin bong, I ain't got no problem, we can hooka, you know what it is
I ain't got no problem, I stick a hole in an apple
The fuck is you talkin bout? I don't give a fuck, nigga
If you just give me a good bud, I put it betwene my mouth nigga
And have some weed snuff, I don't give a fuck, I spit it
It's Gangsta Grillz, you bastard
You stop sitting there, listening to a record like it's a goddamb CD
You know this is part of that motherfuckin pimpin
