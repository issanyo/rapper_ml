[Intro: Chris Brown]
Yeah man, In My Zone baby, it's like this, you ready?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All the girls I know you're sexy, take it off girl let me
Let me rub on yo thighs when I look in your eyes
Money, all the girls I know you're sexy, take it off girl let me
Let me rub on yo thighs when I look in your eyes
Money ain't a, all the girls I know you're sexy, take it off girl let me
Let me rub on yo thighs when I look in your eyes
Money ain't a thing to me lil shawty cause we gon' change them sheets when we naughty
Let me hear you say aah, say aah

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Baby, I got you pulling on the covers
45 minutes in it and I'm still under
Bet I make thunder, hurricane season wet dripping on my face
Damn who turned on the sprinkler?
Shawty, I love it when you're on drop baby, go girl
And baby when I'm in it we going for the second round third round fourth round
Bad and you know it clap your hands, might as well leave off your pants
I know what's about to happen now, baby girl l-let me take you down take you down

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All the girls I know you're sexy, take it off girl let me
Let me rub on yo thighs when I look in your eyes
Money ain't a thing to me lil shawty cause we gon' change them sheets when we naughty
Let me hear you say aah, say aah

[Verse 2: T-Breezy]
Yeah, I'm flyer than a spaceship so fresh so clean
Shorty wanna ride on my scream machine have her like aah
You ain't gotta panic
You with a sex mechanic
I just wanna be your friend, I don't wanna be ya man
I can have you feeling legless Ms. Lieutenant Dan
Sweep ya feet off the concrete
Looking like eye candy wanna rip it off when you screaming "Those are my panties"
Shorty mine is official, harder than a missile
Shorty giving neck bone down to the gristle
I don't know if the drink or if she's a fan
All I know is that she 'bout to go to La La Land
With T-Bree in the back on the jeep
We bumping to CB I'm hitting the lottery
What? ch in you ain't sipping this here for free
My hustle so real got you caught up in the breeze

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All the girls I know you're sexy, take it off girl let me
Let me rub on yo thighs when I look in your eyes
Money ain't a thing to me lil shawty cause we gon' change them sheets when we naughty
Let me hear you say aah, say aah
