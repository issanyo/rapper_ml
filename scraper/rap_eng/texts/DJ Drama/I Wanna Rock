[Chorus]
I wanna rock right now anywhere I go I'm a shut it down
Niggas better know when I break it down, I break shit down, break shit down
I wanna rock right now, now, now, now
I wanna rock right now, now, now, now
I wanna rock right now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now
I wanna rock right now, now, now, now
I wanna rock right now, now, now, now
I wanna rock right now, now, now, now

[Verse]
It's your boy Breezy bad motherfucker
At the age of 15 compare me to Usher
At the age of 18 can't nobody touch 'em
Gone girl
When niggas try to play me say I can't do it
But when it come to this shit ain't nothing to it
And if you wanna hate kiss my ass and my fluid
What I say dawg?
Cause I don't even care
I throw everywhere
Plenty people stare, is that Chris? Yeah
They say I'm crazy so I'mma do it like this

[Chorus]
I wanna rock right now anywhere I go I'm a shut it down
Niggas better know when I break it down, I break shit down, break shit down
I wanna rock right now, now, now, now
I wanna rock right now, now, now, now
I wanna rock right now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now
I wanna rock right now, now, now, now
I wanna rock right now, now, now, now
I wanna rock right now, now, now, now
