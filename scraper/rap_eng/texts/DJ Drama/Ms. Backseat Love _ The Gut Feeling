Ms. Backseat Love

[Intro]
Tory: Hello? Yo Lucille, what's good?
Lucille: What's up?
Tory: Yo shawty, I'm up on block 212 with my niggas, what you doin'?
Lucille: Where you at?
Tory: I'm on the westside, where you at?
Lucille: I need to get the hell up outta here
Tory: 'Cause?
Lucille: My man trippin'

[Chorus]
I know you heard about me
So what's the word about me?
That me and my niggas done came up
And she gotta remember he weak
So she grindin' on me, perfect timin' on me
In the backseat of my Ranger
Shawty, I'm gon' put it down, down
Shawty, I'm gon' put it down, down
Shawty, I'm gon' put it down
Shawty, I'm gon' put it down, down
I'm caught up in the motherfuckin'
Backseat with your love

[Interlude]
Nah, I'm tryna keep it real with y'all niggas, man
Ya know what I'm sayin?
Like this shit sound crazy but happen, you know what I'm sayin?
Shawty fucked me in the back of my car nigga, I call her backseat love nigga
Lil Ms. Backseat Love
(Tell us how it happened nigga)
You know what I'm sayin'?
It happened like woopty woo, pass me the blunt
So like woopty woo, shawty, came through
And I was like, "Yo hop in the whip"
We sip, we smoke
Shawty just started coming onto the Fargo so I'm like
Yo I've gotta take her down like Chris Brown, baby
You know what I'm sayin'?
Took her to the backseat
Whum whum nigga we get it in
But here's the crazy part though
Remember homie we slit on the other day?
It's this nigga's bitch
It's homie bitch my nigga
(Bro get the fuck out of here)
Yeah, risky business, nigga
He said I ain't gon' front though
Like I still fuck around and hit that bitch like today, my nigga
Like this shit crazy, nigga
That head top was crazy, I'm tryna go up
Ya feel me, nigga?

The Gut Feeling

[Verse]
As I stand on my toes, playin' my boss
My foot leg in the snow cold
As the window brim when it breeze and it blow
Try to live like Christ in the image of 'em
But life with these niggas from a lost breed, double crossin' thoughts to breed in
Droppin' out with no job, made it hard to succeed, fuck
I'm puttin' in work but I'm stuck
I'm pushin' this work but it sucks
Down in that third like my worth made bucks, fuck it
I'm livin' amongst rugged niggas that go fuck with niggas
With fuckin' digits and as long as they surround your kin
Come and kick it, oh fuck with the one
Nothin' under this sun exquisite
Sink into my stomach as I laugh and brag with some of my youngiin's from this rotten onion
Just the thought alone that shawty havin' my phone and number
Hit my call, I knew that there was more in store for me
The rock inside, I knew that it was more important for me
10, but ain't this who I am?
Convincin' myself dear mama, wasn't gon' tell 'em that
She got them rolled on and drop low's, exploded 4's on 'em
I know she knows wussup, nowhere to go but up
