[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
When you showing me all the ways to love
Damn it drives me crazy I can't get enough
So many before never really sure
But you showed me baby

[Pre-Chorus: Lonny Bereal & Chris Brown]
What it really means to give your heart to someone
Can't even lie that was something I've never done
Until you came along and made me better
I don't have to look farther girl, yes it's true

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't never need nothing if I got you
Just want to give me love, wanna give it all to you, I'll give you this I promise
I know you love it when I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside
I know you love it when I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside, sex love

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I'mma be your heart, you can read my mind
I don't understand it but I let it slide
Anything you want baby I'll do it
I know what real love is and girl we gonna make some
I know that I'm gonna please your body
Leaving you wanting more, I'm sure
Girl don't worry we don't have to hurry
And I'll never go no where

[Pre-Chorus: Lonny Bereal & Chris Brown]
What it really means to give your heart to someone
Can't even lie that was something I've never done
Until you came along and made me better
I don't have to look farther girl, yes it's true

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't never need nothing if I got you
Just want to give me love, wanna give it all to you, I'll give you this I promise
I know you love it when I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside
I know you love it when I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside, sex love

[Bridge: Se7en]
Finally found someone who appreciates what I do
So many other miss out on love and they don't have a clue
Unbelievable you wanted me
And I know I'm sane right here laying with you, oh with you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't never need nothing if I got you
Just want to give me love, wanna give it all to you, I'll give you this I promise
I know you love it when I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside
I know you love it when I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside, sex love
