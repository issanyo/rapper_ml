[Intro]
Co co cocaine caine co co cocaine
Meastro on the beat Yo Gotti on the mic fishscale dreams all night
Nigga this that cocaine music homie don't you confuse it
Lames gone cop it d-boys gone abuse it

See nigga it's a difference between a documentary in a movie you know what I mean it's cocaine music 4.5 real life non fiction you niggas characters you niggas actresses you niggas playing in movies you niggas bitches!

[Verse 1]
Co co cocaine caine co co cocaine
Meastro on the beat Yo Gotti on the mic
Fishscale dreams all night nigga this that cocaine music homie don't you confuse it
Lames gone cop it d-boys gone abuse it
Hit the gas on my 454 got to let my pipe breath
Twenty-four with floaters on that bitch look like I'm riding easy
Wet paint candy now and later flavor
White on white leather for the head, ewww
Marshmallows lemonade in the chain
Twins cause my watch look the same
Ice cream cutlass seats red velvet cake
Somebody blow the candles out today my rims birthday
Wood grain gripping while I'm swerving in slabbing doors open yawning like they just finish napping
Sixteen soft white like a napkin Birdman sent them so you know they coming flapping

[Hook]
This that cocaine music homie don't you confuse it
Lames gone cop it d-boys gone abuse it
Cocaine music homie don't you confuse it
Lames gone cop it d-boys gone abuse it

[Verse 2]
Cocaine jeah I hear voices you don't hear
Swag taking off like like I'm flying in a leer
Street nigga cred dopeboy of the year
Cocaine music realest shit your gonna hear
My rims doing jumping jacks tops doing sit ups man
Let's just say my whole car on a fitness plan
You still getting fronted you still owe the man
Let's just say your whole life been finance
30 months small payments can you handle pressure
I get so many of the things I can't afford to test
Yea but fuck ya feed them beans let starve
Cause he the type to say that he got robbed, liar
If I pull that trigger the coroner going have to get him
His family gone have to miss him I swear to god I ain't want to kill them damn
My brother looked me dead in my eyes
Told me never let these pussy niggas slide so fuck them

[Hook]

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Let's paint another scenario so you made it out the streets you got on real quick glue then the hype was spend all that money ain't got nothing to show for it all you got is the memories
