I said I solemnly swear I'd take my team to the top
You know pyrex pots, you know they came with a top
And I just left the lot in a brand new drop
And I ain't pay for the roof cause me no like gettin' topped
I make it rough on you niggas, I make it rough on you hoes
Quarter brick in my pocket, I spent that shit on my clothes
You know it costs a few hundred, yeah you should see what I drove
Clip hold half a hundred, I bought that shit for my foes I make it rough on you niggas, I make it rough on you hoes
And it hold half a hundred, I bought that shit for my foes Malibu and Ciroc, I think i jus lost my top
I think i jus went crazy, I mean my chain too lazy
These niggas seldom made it.nahhhhh snow believe em
These niggas talk like they killas
Dont act like that when i see em
I call em out how i see em, my house look like a museum
You gotta be bullshittin snow, maybe a small collisuem
What kinda vest you got on? I think it Christian Dior
Got thirty Ks in my cupboard — look like im ready for war
Brand new Glock out the box, scratch out the serial number
Then i pull up in the drop, like bitch just give me your number — with a meal, Louie V, eight hundred for sweats
Another 3 for the top, you know that bitch bounced my cheque I make it rough on these niggas
Man I make it rough on these hoes
Shot that lou kang to coopers?
Still got that cutlass on 4s
And I put the bounce with the bunnies
Cause they like the dust up they nose
Man I straight Lewinsky these bitches
Get brain and bust on they clothes
Might be my last night
Got gas and shit for the glass pipe
Hop out, hit a nigga with the act right
Niggas rap but they ain't about that life, is that right
You heard about them Gary niggas
That murder cap straight burry nigga
Gotta choppa thang you betta carry witchya
Dont come flexin my area nigga
My boost phone twerk
Hit a lick nigga who got work
Better go get Duct Tape
The nigga pump faked, his whole crew got burnt
And I crush his feelings
Copped that southern Cali condo when I killed him
Tried to get my nigga Young to move out West and cop the buildin
