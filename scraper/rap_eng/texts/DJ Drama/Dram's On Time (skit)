[Fab]: Dram
[Drama]: Loso
[Fab]: No Bahamas this time, huh?
[Drama]: You owe me some vacation time
[Fab]: I guess you finally see the importance of killing the competition
[Drama]: Stop forcing these murders on me
[Fab]: You see, I'm always athe funeral early
I like to get a good seat, view the body, laugh in the face of the competition's family
You know, that's just me, doing the things that I like to do
But Drama, DJ Drama
This guy has no respect
He just shows up, whenever the fuck he feels like it
And what does he say?
[Drama]: Aye! Somebody told me there was funeral goin' on out dis bitch!
