[Intro - DJ Drama]
I mean, we can agree that balance is necessary, right?  We can agree that some of this shit done got out of control, right?  We ain’t gonna take it too far left, though.  We gonna stay street, stay revolutionary right here in this middle lane

[Verse 1 – M-1]
Yo, imagine me with no imagination
No imitation.  It’s Exhibit M… it’s my improvisation
Hope I improved on what you thought was impossible
My impersonation of myself is mythological
Emperor Imhotep—I am a saurus
I’m a monk up in the mountains, meditating in the marshes
Importing that magical forest, smoking that Mary Jane
Self-medicating myself.  This world is so insane
I put my emphasis on things more important
Yo, it’s M. Jordan imparting wisdom with my performance
I’m Immortal Technically speaking
Immaculately conceiving
Hit you with that Swahili greeting
I’m the one between the L and the N
Motherfuck… Oh please excuse, I get excited
I’m against the M-N-F-N system
They immobilize the marches of the movement
And imprison many people
Now they monitor the music
Making martyrs out of you and me
We ain’t getting Emmy’s or no Oscars or no Grammy’s
It’s the same old inmate to the Uno
The emblem is the panther, not a pimp
And my woman is an empress if you ever get a glimpse
My impression of a moron is an empty minded man
For an imbecile, death is imminent.  Understand?
Murder one.  Master knowledge, but my mama says, “Mutulu
Fuck around and get impaled.  Yo, don’t let the smile fool you
Leave a mark on your monument.”
Fuck the X and the Y.  The M gene is dominant
M-M-M-Malcolm and M-M-M-Mart-Martin
