I mean basically I name it 4 and 1/2
Because it's a very special number to me 125 grams
I mean some people may not even know what it mean
But for the people who do this who it's for

[DJ Drama]
Aight let me paint the picture
Use to always sit around talking bout
How you was known in the streets
When this music shit pop off he was out
Because he was so damn good at it
So you got to the top an the streets still needed you

[Yo Gotti]
Once upon a time in a small city Memphis
It was some gangsta young niggas running round through north memphis
Getting money fucking hoes smoking kush
Chopper by the house another one by the bush [repeat]
Democrats no republicans like bush
So we had that killer cali we coming in by the bush
Shoot a hundred bet hundred it ain't nun to me
Caught a plug take that work that was sum to me
One move turned to another then niggas got greedy
Before you know it we rob the whole fucking city
Back against the wall cause now we going to war with the whole town
Caught some of my homies down bad with they guard down

[announcer]
Yes this is tom anderson reporting live w.h.I.g.v
And I'm coming to you from north memphis
Where massive gun fire has saddened the community
Where a young man was shot several times
Outside of the community grocery store
People let's please stop the violence
If anybody have any suggestions please dial 527 - gunz

A couple funerals had to mask up
Then the feds scoop have of the whole hood up
A couple niggas started pointing fingers
Around the time back to the basics dropped and I had a nice single
Had the whole world saying watsup
And the feds was trying to see what's watsup
But fuck ya they had 11 witnesses
Who said they bought some or sold some to me niggas all in my business
And this that real life no bullshitting
This that straight facts no fiction
I see hoe niggas and I just feel friction
Givem one to they head leave they top missing

[DJ Drama]
Please don't get offended
I mean cocaine muzik it's the american way
Let's look at histroy those that get to the top
Never leave street mentality government business
And you know this motherfucking rap game
