Know What's Up

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
She drop that dang thing on me
I stand up throwin' bands up, girl, everythin' on me
You know I'm in this bitch with my niggas, long thing in my jeans
It's gettin' late and these niggas rowdy, don't leave without it on me
I got them stones all in my chain, big dollar my bank
Said that she ain't cuttin', I said "What the fuck did you came for?"
Is he yo nigga? Is he yo bitch?
I'm headin' to wherever, I'm gon' see your bitch
If niggas hatin' on me, put the hammer all in my hands
When she see me up in that 3, she went magic all on her man
'Cause she know what's up
Oh yeah, she know what's up

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You ain't got a man? Come fuck with me
Roll up in that Benz, that AMG
You know I got them bands, they all on me
I know you wanna roll, so, you can tell me no
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
Say you ain't got a man, sure enough
I pull up in that Lamb', hold up
We both want it, we can't blame no one
And I ain't tryna play no one
But he can't make you famous like this
No, he don't got you fiendin' like this
Say, he might had your body but tonight I'm in your soul
Girl, just keep playin' my shit
Love the way I talk, I make you love the way I sing
Love the way I walk, I'll make you love the way I swang
Girl, I make you love everythin' that
You don't love about these niggas, girl, I love you naked

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You ain't got a man? Come fuck with me
Roll up in that Benz, that AMG
You know I got them bands, they all on me
I know you wanna roll, so, you can tell me no
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
'Cause when you drop that thing on me
Like it's the end of the night
I swear if niggas hate, you know I got that thing on me
No need for no fight

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You ain't got a man? Come fuck with me
Roll up in that Benz, that AMG
You know I got them bands, they all on me
I know you wanna roll, so, you can tell me no
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up

The Take

[Verse]
Hop in, oh, what's up?
When I seen that body go down
And your friends at the club
Me, I'm really tryna go
Now that I got you, it's goin' down
So girl, don't you run from me
'Cause what I like, you like, we gon' like
I'ma feel up, feel down, feels alright
Might have to fly your ass to Toronto ("Hol' Up, why?")
'Cause shawty got that ass like a model
And all these other women ain't got nothin' on her
You know that ass stop me from leavin' here tonight and tomorrow
I officially laid it down, oh, I laid it down
She has been taken since the the day I laid it down, down, down, down
Taken, told you not to pull up with your shawty, taken
