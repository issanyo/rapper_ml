[Intro]
What's up y'all
I know it's been a minute
But actually it hasn't
Did you miss me?

[Verse 1]
Most of these niggas ain't talkin' bout shit, well I'm here to change that
My pockets still hurting my nigga the fame ain't changed that
A nigga signed a deal they think I ain't be wanting my change back
Labels dropped the ball trying to figure out where my lane at
The flow that resurrect, feel like Bigge and Pac done came back
"Maybe it ain't your time", why the fuck would I entertain that
I sat in meetings talent getting mistreated feeling useless
I write, rap, and produce how you not know what to do with
A nigga that see the future like Ciara
A breath of fresh air an inhaler
I'm only a failure at failure
Keenan and Kel ya
Nowadays hoes sayin' I'm all that
Remember I needed features a nigga couldn't get a call back
Niggas in the hood that was hatin' wanna take it all back
White girls twerking on me mami that's all back
But head in the dressing room gonna solve that

[Verse 2]
I do acrobats this Mike Jackson with his afro back nigga off the wall
And he sick they ain't playin defense cause I can't get these niggas off my balls
The flow make niggas mental pause like menopause that could change a life
Had a bitch on the phone last night had to change her flight like bitch let me change your life
Let me change your life (x2)
Hol' up
Yeah bitch let me change your life
They say that love don't cost a thing these hoes done changed the price
Consequences of the music business happen over night
Shit overpriced get overwhelmed in oral hoes with overbites
Ain't' nothing normal feel like you immortal nothing kill your vibe
Miami nights feel like Miami Vice you there on Grammy night
At Jimmy house watching a Manny fight a Vic & Xanny night
So many nights I felt like Hov this can't be life
Shit I was orphan Annie now I do this in memory of my granny like
Me and my sister wanted to live Ray J and Brandy life
I went from Mike and Ikes to fuck the price to get my family right
So nigga if 2012 was the best in the world now they be like damn he right

[Verse 3]
Yup damn he right
They be like fuck he right
I deserve a bad bitch with a bad friend to come fuck me right
Never say die how the fuck imma give up
When fame in this game is as long as a hiccup
Now Dre done deliver the nigga that know it's his time and he told me enjoy every minute
I'm in it committed the flow is so crazy I should be committed
I'm coming till I hit the ceiling Sold a million records damn a nigga reckless killin' everybody up in here
And there it is blood all over my fucking wall
Can't go to functions with bad hoes cause I prolly done fucked them all
Like I took the condom off gosh I'm saying I'm fucking raw
Fuck with real niggas my nigga I just don't fuck with y'all
Might give play to you niggas be cool with some of y'all
Have friends that fucked me over so I really ain't trusting none of y'all
My grandad's still in the hood hoping his number fall
Ninth grade Trumbull Street talkin' hoes out their Wonder Bra
Hundred dollars Genesee Valley feelin' like I run the mall
So I can get a fit for the night feelin' like I run The Loft
Feelin' like I run the Loft
Damn that take me back
To when Mo used to take me to stages daily and make me rap
Nothing basic only chase greatness and stay on pace with that
Ignore the hating and keep strong when you faced with that
Revenge is sweet can't wait to eat when you get a taste of that
Your dimes prepared you for your ups and I'm OK with that
By any means push through
That's what we must do
I'm living proof that dreams come true, my nigga

[Outro]
Now that's how you start a motherfucking mixtape
Best in the Motherfucking World
Do I know how to come back or what
The People's Rapper right
I do this shit for y'all
These mixtapes be for ya'll
I swear to God just my way of saying thank you
Y'all see what it is
Ain't nothing changed not at all
So welcome to the Best of the World
"The Late Registration of a College Dropout who had a Dark Twisted Fantasy of 808s and Heartbreak"
Just call that shit "Best in the World" Kanye
It don't matter man
I'm just silly as fuck man
Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood..
