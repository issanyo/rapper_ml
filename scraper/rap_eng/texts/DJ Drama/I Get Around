[Intro]
I do, I
I do that, we does this
I do that, Gangsta Griliz
I do that, Breezy

[Verse 1]
Up, high, down, low, I be anywhere you want
Not the one but slipping, but I'm sliding in yo Mary go
Ram like the size of them wheels that's on a Chevy though
Ass so retarded, the homies calling you radio
I get it on the floor, when I beat I do my Dougie though
Gorilla, yes I am a.k.a. Mr. Ma-Mighty Joe
Simon says do this and I say do that
I'm hoping out that whip, while yo chick saying "Who that?"

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the way I gotta be, it's not changing
Hella girls in front of me, but I'm choosing
If you think you can handle me then get in here now
And baby gimme what you ga-got
I'll show you all the goods and I'll turn you out
Don't be acting like you don't want it now
Lemme apologise cause I'mma wear you out

[Chorus]
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get, I get, I get, I get
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get around, I get around (I do that)

[Verse 2]
Shawty so bad, got me like "Ooh," Louis V. bag, Louis V. shoes
Shawty got class, ain't no need for school, she got swag, swag, swag like
No photos, look at her frame, Bentley two doors, switching up lanes
Hit the airport we switching up planes, planes, planes like

[Chorus]
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get, I get, I get, I get
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get, I get, I get, I get
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get around, I get around (I do that)
I get around, I get around (I do that)
