[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Bar Exam 3 is like a mock a nigga, pop a nigga mockery
Housin', put the lock on it, Monopoly
Call me Enterpriser, stick my battery
Inside a little white bunny, you can call me Energizer
The most interesting man in the world, I know papi
Sippin' root beer floats Saki mixed with Dos Equis
I'm a Slaughterhouse rock star, I pick up the biggest pig
I can find and throw it at the windshield of a cop car
Dissin' me can be pretty fatal 'cause bitch, I got Money In The Bank from puttin' that shit into Yayo like 50's label
Fuckin' freak, ya mommy and daddy, daddy and daughter
Ya daddy, your grand daddy, your name fatty is Carter
She like, "Get inside me" but that's a tight squeeze
Once I'm in her juice box she gon' hit the Hi-C's/high c/high sea
I'm hooked up cause I'm ill ass fuck like I.V.'s
I bare arms like it ain't nothin' up my sleeves
The next MC that rhyme 'official' with 'ref with a whistle'
That ain't Young Money, I'mma definitely diss you, if you
Rhymin' 'packin' a mac' with 'back of the Acura'
Perhaps you can't match my spectacular vernacular
You still rhymin' 'bottles' with 'models', 'college' with 'knowledge'
Usin' the word 'swagga,' you're probably garbage
You thugs funny, comparin' 5'9" to anybody
You comparin' Superman to Bugs Bunny

[Interlude: Royce da 5'9"]
You are now rockin' with the Bar Exam 3!
The most interesting man in the world

BE3 go (hard, hard-hard)
Nickel Nine go (hard, hard-hard)
Kid Vishis go (hard, hard-hard)
Nigga we so (hard, hard-hard)

[Verse 2: Kid Vishis]
I be blazin'
I'm talkin' 'bout stoned, Goliath in the fight vs. David
I'll kill ya, bullets ain't lyrical, blaoka!
Straight to the point, the gun's Waka Flocka
Rhymes is electric, five volts
It'll make your voice crack like Whitney hittin' high notes
I got a metal gut with large nuts
You bitch ass niggas, we call y'all "dog butts"
Yeah, I remember what they said
Yeah, my pockets used to be skinny, now they fat like K-Fed
Aww man, my bullets is a fan of me
Kiss him right in the mouth, do him like Kid Cudi
They say one man's trash, another man's treasure
I call her a fat, black, bitch, you call her Precious
Since I'm a gun blazer
It cost me nothin' to take your money, Vishis like a fund raiser
Ruger by me, you with a gun
Is a bigger myth than Jay-Z in the Illuminati
This is B verse rockin', so you gettin' punched up
More than Mike Tyson do to paparazzi
Freeze when you see the mag, I don't flash I blast
Leave his ass as nasty as Trina rash
When it come to that rhymin' shit
Nigga, I'm a steroid shot, you a Flintstone Vitamin

[Interlude: Royce da 5'9"]
