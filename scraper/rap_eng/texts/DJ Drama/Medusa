[Intro]
Valentine's Day ladies, hope y'all listening, check these out man
This one's I wrote in the studio personally for y'all
So check 'em out, love y'all
In My Zone, oh Breezy

[Verse 1]
Innocent, Heaven sent, that's the way she look
Make you turn around again take a second look
Caught my eye walking by
Out there like she modelling, and I just had to have her
My favorite thing to watch on her is her legs
But I love everything about her, there's nothing to replace
So I call her over to my whip
Tryna see what the business is

[Pre-Chorus]
Then she hopped up in my ride, ride
Then I looked into her eyes, eyes
She cold as ice, turned me to stone, stone
Couldn't move cause the way she rocking them Jimmy Choo's

[Chorus]
I call her Medusa, she the type of girl that seduce ya
She that type of girl
She that type of girl that'll turn you into stone
Look her in the eyes and you can't leave her alone
I call her Medusa, she the type of girl that seduce ya
She that type of girl
She that type of girl that'll turn you into stone
Look her in the eyes and you can't leave her alone

[Verse 2]
Shawty got what I want, I got what she need
But I don't mind if she take advantage of me
Cause she got that bomb shit, I'm talking atomic
My player days are demolished
She done took me out the game, now she packing heat
Gunning for my last name, I can't even lie
Shawty got some great aim, gotta keep her looking good
Man, she really had me hooked

[Pre-Chorus]
Then she hopped up in my ride, ride
Then I looked into her eyes, eyes
She cold as ice, turned me to stone, stone
Couldn't move cause the way she rocking them Jimmy Choo's

[Chorus]
I call her Medusa, she the type of girl that seduce ya
She that type of girl
She that type of girl that'll turn you into stone
Look her in the eyes and you can't leave her alone
I call her Medusa, she the type of girl that seduce ya
She that type of girl
She that type of girl that'll turn you into stone
Look her in the eyes and you can't leave her alone

[Outro]
This girl she always gets a shopping spree outta me, yeah
I'll Louis Vuitto, her then Dolce & Gabbana
Gucci or Prada, shawty get anything she wanna
Don't know how she always gets a shopping spree outta me, yeah
It don't matter what it costed, money ain't an object
She wear it the best, so she get it when she want it
