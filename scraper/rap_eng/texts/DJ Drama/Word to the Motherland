[Intro: Pharrell Williams and (DJ Drama)]
Nah, nah dude seriously, did I monster that?
Did I monster that though? It's nothin'
Uh, check it out (Gangsta Breezy)

[Verse 1]
Real niggas save up for out-of-state, but collect stash houses
Drive Jeep wagons taxidermy their couches
Getting small dope, fuck LV pouches
On the corner selling' that tiger, you can tell how they crouch
I've seen pictures of Jimmy Henchman when he was in jail
Fresh beeper, fresh chain, fresh sneaker detail
Like he could, order anything from hits to sales
Like he in the four seasons ordering cocktails
Real gangsta's do it, they don't have to prove it
The keys is spoken for, you don't tell 'em to move it
They operate just like sleuths, they flow
Fiends and hoes as they [?]
Like the three letter crew out in ATL
Fed's scratching they heads sayin', "will they please tell"
The nigga [?] like the new Rayfel
With police escorts that's louder than a [?] sale (Uh-Huh)
And you get [?] get your Steinberg's [?]
He paid that way, you think he ain't gon' write it?
The fed's get excited, not knowin' the con's inside it
So [?] the day they tried before they even write it (Gangsta Breezy)
Now back to the necessity if you gon' supply it
All your weak links, Donald Trump, and nigga you're fired
I did my research, my street exposure reworked
I was too busy drivin' in [?] and hoes [?]
Now remember, who got you hired?
Who both, educate and spit the shit you like?
Now analyze the picture that the non-thug drew
Sip your Corona, and puff your [?]

[Hook]
Time for the, time for the, best of the best (Time for the, time for the, best)
The new double-R driver BBC on my chest (The new double-R driver BBC on my chest)
When you got your marked Jigga boots with the LV dress (Marked Jigga boots with the LV dress)
Yeah, well holler at the kid, yessir, nothin' less (Holler at the kid, yessir, nothin' less)
