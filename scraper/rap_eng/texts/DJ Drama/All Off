[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Your body is a blessing, ain't no second guessing
And got no competition 'cause shawty you the bestest
Ain't no hesitation, tryna get you naked
You got somethin' I wanna see

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Your clothes look good but they look great on the floor
So hurry up and take 'em off
Don't act like we ain't did this before
So baby let's go and bring your body over here

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby you want it all the time and I do to
Can we get really freaky?
However you want, girl it's up to you
Take it all off, want you naked in the dark
Take it all off, however you want girl it's up to you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
And I wanna do something nasty tonight, night, night, night
And everything you do to me girl it feels so right, right right, right
Love when you feelin' me, I got you moanin'
You ain't gon go asleep, not until mornin'
Giving you chills down your spine, yeah yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Your clothes look good but they look great on the floor
So hurry up and take 'em off
Don't act like we ain't did this before
So baby let's go and bring your body over here

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby you want it all the time and I do to
Can we get really freaky?
However you want, girl it's up to you
Take it all off, want you naked in the dark
Take it all off, however you want girl it's up to you
