[Intro: Meek Mill]
Y'all niggas wanted me to go to jail right
Y'all wished the judge gave me a lot of years didn't y'all
Fucking haters
What y'all going to do now
Y'all can't kill me

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
The wait is over bitch I'm back
Haters see my face and almost had a heart attack
When they arrested me they was all with that
But when they let me free they all went into cardiac

[Interlude: DJ Drama]
Its like our welcome home party
You home, brought Meek home
Philly we did it
Flamerz

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
The wait is over bitch I'm back
Haters see my face and almost had a heart attack
When they arrested me they was all with that
But when they let me free they all went into cardiac

[Hook: Meek Mill]
The wait is over, the wait is over
Cooked crack I'm about to bubble like I'm baking soda
Like I'm in the race but I'm chasing [?]
Hottest in America ya I'm about to take it over

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Mr. Hottest in the United States
Swagger on a million my flow be on outer space
I'm snatching rapping niggas out their place
Eenie meenie miney moe knock them all out of the way
Hit that nigga Drake, call Wheezy up
My niggas move them birds too call Jeezey up
Ask them if they're playing ball see if they're cheap enough
Pac-Man of the rap game, trail them all eat 'em up
Get money play for gang green
And my niggas get it too we're on the same team
Had 100,000 fans when I was eighteen
That's why these haters want to see me die like Beijing

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
The wait is over bitch I'm back
Haters see my face and almost had a heart attack
When they arrested me they was all with that
But when they let me free they all went into cardiac

[Hook: Meek Mill]
The wait is over, the wait is over
Cooked crack I'm about to bubble like I'm baking soda
Like I'm in the race but I'm chasing [?]
Hottest in America ya I'm about to take it over

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I was in the jail cell thinking about millions
Talking about the game and when I touch it I'mma kill them
Rapper keep an eye on your fans before I steal them
Cause in the end I'mma win you niggas just the pilgrims
Watch me, just wait 'til my shit drop
Be on a thousand tracks and never wait for a pit stop
I'm hard body shooting straight for the big shot
Audemar Piguet thirty piece for the wrist watch
Ya, somebody call Kiss cause he'll watch me kill the game and say he never say shit
I put on for my city, make sure we all rich
Open up the door and do some Biggie on some small shit

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
The wait is over bitch I'm back
Haters see my face and almost had a heart attack
When they arrested me they was all with that
But when they let me free they all went into cardiac

[Hook: Meek Mill]
The wait is over, the wait is over
Cooked crack I'm about to bubble like I'm baking soda
Like I'm in the race but I'm chasing [?]
Hottest in America ya I'm about to take it over

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Flamerz 3 baby, we home
Matter fact I might get on my '95 '96 Dram shit
Throw the ski goggles on my head or something
These the Louies though
Meek, you feel me?
