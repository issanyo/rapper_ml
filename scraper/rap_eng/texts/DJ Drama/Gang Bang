[Verse 1: Joe Moses]
When I holla fifties I'mma die for this shit
25 the life got a ride for the clique
Fruits to the harvest can't deny me for shit
20 to the jays we get life in this bitch
Nigga tell him what it is, my daddy raised me
The big homie shark used to soccer chase me
My homie D.E.L. used to motivate me
I'm just reppin' my section while these niggas hate me
There's hoes over money how these niggas act that
This AOB for life I ain't never back down
Everybody tough everybody rap now
My name ring bells you ain't gotta ask around
But back to the set we gon' fuck 'em in the hood
Love a hood bitch that never act hollywood
Tell 'em to their motherfucking face you a morph
Wanna bang the set come fade at the park

[Chorus]
Cause nigga I'm a gang banger
Give a fuck about rappin'
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get actin'
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get brackin
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get cracking
Cause nigga I'm a gang banger
Give a fuck about rappin'
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get actin'
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get brackin
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get cracking

[Verse 2: Joe Moses]
See I got the 2's up
You fuck Jabba you gon' fuck me
You fuck Mills you gon' fuck blee
This the same gang, we all the fuck easy fuck lames
Baby mom from the different lane
I tell 'em woo woo, black bentley with the no roof
A big dog I'm a blunt snoop
Nigga no smuck, my young nigga holla so what
And if it's on we can knuckle up
Or we can shoot it out, real crips got love for me
Whole niggas know love for 'em
You can't beat me
I'm authentic and I'm too real
In the county I was too thrill
It was me and baby stretch , boo crew and LS
Lil Maniac we was hoping out the GS
Passing up the ten, got money for show
If you ain't real then you don't know

[Chorus]
Cause nigga I'm a gang banger
Give a fuck about rappin'
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get actin'
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get brackin
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get cracking
Cause nigga I'm a gang banger
Give a fuck about rappin'
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get actin'
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get brackin
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get cracking

[Verse 3: YG]
Wait, nigga where you from
Huh? fuck 'em never heard of
Fuck it, dump on them , swerv on them
Piss on the pistol
Make sure you put them jaws on
I'm a rider, gonna provide them
Fuck your hood and your baby mama
You don't want problems on my mama
I pay for your death I'm a nigga with dollars
Ye it's west side, TTP , 4 hundred spoof street
My nigga Chief like Kief got strappin
The cheek under the seat on ring like under the clique
Checking to pee on your bitch ass niggas
You know Marcus in your hood, ye that snitch ass nigga
Should've been born with a pussy you a bitch ass nigga
Ask about me in the hood, they tell you I'm a G
I'm a real one nigga I don't trip

[Chorus]
Cause nigga I'm a gang banger
Give a fuck about rappin'
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get actin'
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get brackin
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get cracking
Cause nigga I'm a gang banger
Give a fuck about rappin'
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get actin'
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get brackin
If it's on then it's on
Bet a nigga get cracking
