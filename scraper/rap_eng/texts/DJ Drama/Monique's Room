I don't give a fuck about chu anymore (anymore)
I don't give a fuck about chu anymore, girl (anymore)

Told you it was gon' cost you (told you)
I misplace things, I'm sorry if I lost you
Yeah right, I fuck your best friend purposely
My hearts teflon how dare you try hurt'n me
I fuck shorty you hate, I told her work with me
And she do it better than you bitch
That's word to me
We send the vids to your Facebook
I wish I would of seen how your face looked
While I'm violating, your a pretender
You caught amnesia, you don't remember
Well I got the memory of an elephant
I would say the nigga name, but he ain't relevant

I don't give a fuck about chu anymore (anymore)
I don't give a fuck about chu anymore, girl (anymore)

Your sister told me you was crying
And was feeling like you were dying
I told if I said 'I give a fuck'
I'd be lying
Cupid sent a slug through my shirt
Told me if you cross me, my love would reverse
Stupid bitch, damn you
I'm glad your heart is cripple
I can't stand you
I was the man who planned to cuff it up
But you had dicks on the ceiling, you fucked it up
Lying ass hoe
I bounce right up, now I'm flying that's low
Told you I got the memory of an elephant
I would say the nigga name, but he ain't relevant

I don't give a fuck about chu anymore (anymore)
I don't give a fuck about chu anymore, girl (anymore)

I'm a I'm a I'm a real nigga
I deserve better
So fuck you
I'm a I'm a I'm a real nigga
I deserve better
So fuck you
I hate chu
I don't give a fuck about chu anymore (anymore)
I don't give a fuck about chu anymore girl (anymore)
