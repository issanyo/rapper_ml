[Chorus]
High-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer
I went from a high-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer
I went from a high-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer
Like I'm a transformer, like I'm I'm a transformer

[Verse 1]
Smoke grey Enzo looking like a shadow
550 Benzo you ain't on my level
Shawty gotta body cone shaped like a bottle
Magazine star dating nothing but the models

[Chorus]
High-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer
I went from a high-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer
I went from a high-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer
Like I'm a transformer, like I'm I'm a transformer

[Verse 2]
Smoke grey Enzo looking like a shadow
550 Benzo you ain't on my level
Shawty gotta body cone shaped like a bottle
Magazine star dating nothing but the models
Money piling up you would think I won the lotto
Cash rule everything around me, that's my motto
All black Rolex you had never seen no
Counting big chips you can call me a casino

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey you, shawty what it do?
Whip so sick you can call it bird flu
Got the top back hair blowing in the air
I'm about to kill it this year

[Chorus]
Cause I went from a high-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer
I went from a high-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer
I went from a high-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer
I went from a, like I'm a transformer, like I'm a transformer

[Verse 3]
Point black I'm the best in general
You know I ball and I ain't talking 'bout genitals
I'm a shark you can't catch me with no fishing pole
In the dark you can see me cause my whistle glow
Get some stripes lil mama make my whistle blow
Don't need no mistletoe, but you can kiss it though
But baby drop it low and make it shake for me
Call me Federal Reserve cause I make money
And then I waste money, my chain so sunny
I got them carrots so I share it with them snow bunnies
Yo money is only 'bout yay high
I got that ching ching money like Shanghai
Yeah I'm a fool with it, know what to do wit it
Who you know got a private jet with the windows tinted?
Overseas cash, get overseas ass
Got it on lock like I'm dreading with some beeswax

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey you, shawty what it do?
Whip so sick you can call it bird flu
Got the top back hair blowing in the air
I'm about to kill it this year

[Chorus]
Cause I went from a high-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer
I went from a high-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer
I went from a high-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer
I went from a, like I'm a transformer, like I'm a transformer

[Verse 3]
Hey lil mama pretty thing over there, put my CD on and let it bang through ya ear
You know I'm the best, watch me do my step
And I'mma let you do the rest cause I got dimes on me
And I ain't talking 'bout no weed, I mean fine shawtys and they running with CB yeah
