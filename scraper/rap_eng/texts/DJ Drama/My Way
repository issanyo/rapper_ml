[Hook: Lloyd]
Ohhh
As the city lights up the night
I feel so
Good cause I did it my way
And I know
That I'm just livin' the life of girls and gold
And I feel so good
Cause I did it my way

[Verse 1: Common]
Nights bright like Vegas
The life of girls and gold is so contagious
I been cold
Took the C,O, double M road
Hangin' out the windows
Reachin for the world as the wind blows
The crescendo of my career loud in your ear, ear
I'm proud to be here, now that we here
This year, you can find me at the cosmopolitan
Holding bottles, never bottled in
Probably with Chicagoans
And there's black girls modellin'
Looking for a followin'
Attitude is tolerant
I'm married to the game like Solomon
These rings represent the dreams
We got from the old folk, yearning for the gold coast
My soul spoke things that was necessary
Found forever in ways that are legendary
And through the drama, I stuck to my commentary
Now that everyday man say that Comm is every-where

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I used to dream of rising now I see it clearer
How surprising I'm admiring that mirror
I'm inspiring the finer things in life
And your time is slowly expiring, you're crying me a river
That's ironic, she have a river as well
I like to swim in it like Olympians YSL
And some Timberlands high as hell
The ceiling is an understatement
I burn through it, prove it's a fire drill
Fire hoes, bad bitches fire hoes
Fire hoes then re-hire hoes
Her entire crew is tired of the liars that you runnin by her
I can see you ho
Plenty priors of a fuck nigga, nigga I suppose
I can fly her, put her in attire of designer clothes
Dayton wires on the Chevy, why are you not tryna roll?
Don't you know they already fuck me, I'm a made man
Maids in the mansion clean them up, out here

[Hook]
