Young nigga got it jumpin' like Jordan
200 on the foreign, I'ma get it right back
Bought Versace from Versace
Just to be flashy, I'ma get it right back
Fought a case for the boy
Bitch I got a lawyer, I'ma get it right back
I'm whippin' my wrist to put Rollie on wrist
I'ma get it right back
I'ma get it right back
I'ma get it right back
Got the beam on the tour, just to make sure
I'ma get it right back
I'ma get it right back
I'ma get it right back
I got bitches, yeah plural, just to make sure
I'ma get it right back

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Pulled off the lot, nigga cashed out on the Wraith
I'ma get it right back
You ain't gotta ask, know a nigga got up on his waist
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat
Ain't nothin' but some big boy shit goin' on
That's right, when you see me, nigga
All of this presidential shit that a nigga ridin' in
Might as well move to DC, nigga
I'll hit Lenox Mall up right now
Cash out, everything they got in that bitch
Soon as I'm walkin' out the door, nigga leavin' out the store
They gon' be like God dammit he rich
Guess what? Think I seen Jizzle in the valet
Walkin' 'round with about a hundred bags
2014 in the valet and you know it still got the paper tags
Big black mothafucka with a stripe down the middle
Yeah I call it the silverback
Bitch starin' at the stars on my roof
Same time, keep askin', "Where the ceilin' at?"
Don't get my shit, trying to interrogate me, girl
I don't know you like that
That ain't how it go down, I'll turn this bitch 'round
And I'll take your ass right back

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I'ma get it right back
Lose it, in a week bet I get it right back
Tried to play hard, fucked her on the first week
Bet she comin' right back
Throw it from the back, know you like it like that
If you don't, you lyin', bitch who you think you playin'?
Walked in this mothafuckin' bitch, I'm the man
Louis V earmuffs, can't hear what you're sayin'
Thugger my brother, yeah Jeezy my fam
And it don't mean I'm cussin' if I say the word, "dam"
Cause I'm talkin' 'bout a river
Diamonds shinin' like a mothafuckin' nickel
Feet up, yeah I'm reclinin' on niggas
Pistol out, window down, ridin' on niggas
I'ma get it right back, like I never lost it
Shawty came right back
Had her mouth open like the sign on Lacoste
I told her, "Don't be disrespectful, baby girl don't talk back
Cause it'll cost you"
In the end I say, "Fuck the Lexus, I'ma drive the Benz today"
Thugger, Thugger tell 'em
