[Verse 1: Quez]
Put your hands up its a stick up
Put my dick in her mouth now she got the hiccups
Used to work at Magic City now she work at Pinup
Blunts in the air, I had to buy a sticker
20 bitches in the VIP just twisted
Pulled her titty out and her homegirl licked it
Quez can I get a followback or mention?
Yea if you let me be your dentist
Black girl, white girl, mix it like a chemist
Left cheek, right cheek, flip it like a gymnast
Them niggas can't come we only need the women
Don't need a bougie bitch, she better get with the pimpin' pimpin'

[Hook: Travis Porter]
All the bad bitches in the VIP room
A nigga dressed up in the building
Out of all the bitches out there tonight
One of them might have my children
All the bad bitches in the VIP room
A nigga dressed up in the buildin'
And if your on the dance floor motherfucker let go
Put your motherfuckin' hands to the ceilin'

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
Ugh, real nigga in the building
Shots everywhere, k-killas in the building
Fuck a nigga if she willin
MILF hunter, mama have some motherfuckin' children
Eastside never break down
2 cars deep, 20 bitches on 8 tires
You niggas ain't up in my weightclass
Teacher give me head tell her students like, "wait class"
Catch a main bitch rollin'
Nosy ass niggas goin' off the coca-cola
Pull up in that Rollie, lookin' like I'm Kobe
Same team ho, you niggas Lamar Odom
I be that nigga at his next
Pullin' pennies out my pocket, gettin' head in the vet
Don't you pay me in a check, nigga pay me with respect
While I'm layin with yo next, got her wet (hold up)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Strap]
Real niggas in the building, bitch whats up
Money bein' throwed, you fucked nigga shut up
This ho that ho all wanna go
T-bags ho put my balls in they throat
Girls at Magic, girls act Onyx
Girls at Violet, the hoes get money
(Where you be at?) In the V-I rollin' up a blunt
All that ass I can see it from the front
Tell her do her stunt, abra-ca-da-bra
She said she out of breath workin like she got asthma
Tongue ring I'm diggin' that shit
Put a stack on you, can't do it on a dick
She bring it back and she make it clap like that
Get it from her mama its why her ass so fat
Million dollar niggas tell them bitches came to see us
Cash in the dinem buy them bitches margeritas

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Ali]
Ugh, a real nigga just stepped in the building
A couple bottles couple models just chillin'
I'm sorry baby I ain't got no feelings
I'm 21 and I ain't got no children
I'm a flirt, you say that's yo bitch
Might take her ass home so she can suck that, suck that
I wish she might got a couple niggas with me
Don't take no shit nigga, fuck that, fuck that
But anyway I'm chillin' in that V-I
Big house, big cars, big cheddar
Ride drop top even in the winter
I got a couple bitches kissin' on this bitch
Like this, like that
Kissin' in the VIP but they fuckin in the back
I know this bitch better have my sack
And we some real niggas we gon' end it like that

[Hook]
