What's up with Skateboard P?
Is he that dope? Is he really Barry Bonds? Is he that Sosa?
I'm on a PJ sofa reading D-Pac Chopra
Tryin' to figure out how I'mma act on Oprah
What's up with Skateboard P?
Is he that dope? Is he really Barry Bonds? Is he that Sosa?
I'm on a PJ sofa reading D-Pac Chopra
Tryin' to figure out how I'mma act on Oprah
