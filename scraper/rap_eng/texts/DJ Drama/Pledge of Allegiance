[Intro]
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America

[Hook: Planet VI]
Money fallin from the, money fallen from the sky, sky
Money fallin from the, money fallin from the sky, sky
Money fallin from the, money fallin from the sky
Trying to get some money put your motherfucking hands high

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Money fallen, look at all this money fallen
I throw money in the air because I'm ballin
Bitch I go hard I put my all in
If my phone ring thats money calling
Smell my weed it come from Cali
All my rings are filled with diamonds
Smoke a lot of marijuana on the top because the timin
Haters mad at what I got because I grindin
Now they say that he got game I make it rain like Jesus Christ

[Pre-Hook: Planet VI]
Money fallin from the sky like rain
Right now I'm just tryin to get me some
Everybody wants to get paid
Counting so much money our figures numb
Dollas dollas dollas, hooray
Thats why everynight we wanna be in the club
Nobody ain't tryin to save
Spend each and every dollar as soon as it comes, baby

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Hoopin 365, call that consistent ballin
No carpet thatâ€™s alpaca nigga, you gotta blot it
Ain't in this for profit but since I got it I'm poppin
My lyrics may seem misguided to the petite and simple minded
But I'm so out this world, yeah nigga be solar flexin
When it come to this cash man, I ain't use no discretion
Dollas dollas dollas, just part of me gotta chase em
See my arrested developments probably the ones a playin
My blatant void of concern to prepare for an obligation
I stared death in the face and told em prepare for annihilation
And I always had ambition, couldn't nobody tell me nothin
I was on the hustle since I was this big, hah, now I'm this big

[Bridge] + [Hook x2]

[Bridge: Planet VI]
Land of the free, home of the brave
There's money to make, that's what it takes
What it takes, here in the U.S.A
Where the laws are made, where crime still pays
Theres money to make, that's what it takes
Here in the U.S.A, ay, ay, ay

[Hook x2]
