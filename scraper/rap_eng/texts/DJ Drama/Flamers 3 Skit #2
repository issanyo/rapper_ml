Ayy Drama
(What up Meek)
Who lot of speculation
Drama ain't riding for Philly
(Oh yea)
He only putting on for the A
(Is that so?)
What you think about that

I mean listen man
Don't blame me that every street across the world wants to claim me
Its a positive thing baby
You know born Children's Hospital
You know what I mean G town brick yard happy hallow what's up
West Philly 33rd [?] the bottom what's up man
Come on man born and raised man
Philly's what made me
