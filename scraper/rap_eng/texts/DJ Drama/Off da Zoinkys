[Intro]
I, I am so grateful
I'm very, very, very grateful
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Uh
Alright, J.I.D and (Christo)

[Verse]
Y'all niggas need to lay off the drugs
Some of y'all need to lay off the dope
My niggas gettin' it straight off the boat
Pure cut, put it straight to your nose
I ain't nosy, but I know what I know
Mr. Know-It-All, "oh here he go"
I'm the GOAT, I never go with the flow
Throwin' shots, boy, it's blow for a blow
I'm the nigga kick the do' with the do'
I'm the nigga fuck the ho with the ho
I'm the nigga lit the blunt with the blunt
I'ma get it 'cause I want what I want
I'ma say this shit again and again
I'ma go and put this shit to an end
I'm the sickest with the pencil and pen
Hit the blunt and mix the Hen' with the wait
I'ma go ahead and lay off the Xans
I'ma fall back sippin' the lean
I gotta make sure my vision is clear
Oh God, no, it's not what it seems
Six, five, four, one, two, three
.45 tote, you know me
You don't want smoke, so what it's gon' be?
Gotta watch what you say when you lookin' at me
Lookin' at God, lookin' for leaders, lookin' for keys
Look at the pain in your eyes, nigga, look where we been
Look at our wins, look at our sins, and look at our skin
I've been on a frenzy binge tryna get me a Benz
And then your fuzzy ass dance wanna fuck up the ends
Oh God, no, where are my friends?
Lord forgive me, yeah, I need to repent
Mind blurred, need to lay off the drugs
Yeah God, they ain't prayin' enough
Niggas dyin', we ain't sayin' enough
Cops fire, stockpiling rottweiler
Tell my little niggas lay off the stuff
Ronald Reagan, I can't thank him enough
Nah, I'm playin', nigga racist as fuck
Told my nigga if he leave a pack of ports around me, I'ma take em'
And throw em' away
He smoke em' around me, I'ma break em'
And we almost had got into fightin'
I'm talkin' 'bout dead that, finna fade it
But shit, but maybe I did too much
But fuck it, I love my nigga, I'ma save him
And he prolly thinkin' I'm a player-hater
I don't hate a player, I just need all my niggas to wake up
And take a real good look, we a long way from Decatur
Long days still ahead of us, grown dads still scared of us
I'm just workin' my incredible
Stick my dick in the inevitable
So fuck whatever happen, fuckin' cinematic
Sins of the father, I'm a fuckin' addict
Understand addiction, so I'm sympathetic
But I know, I know, I know that I gotta be strong
I ain't tryna be where I don't belong
Little syrup sippin' out of a foam
Little powder, put the pot in the bong
I ain't trippin', I ain't sayin' it's wrong
But, it's some other shit we can be on

[Bridge]
Gangsta Gri-zillz
Oh, now that I may be free, yeah
And he, he...

[Outro]
...if you need it
Yeah
'Cause we the old people, you know
That's way you get blessed
Yeah
That's comes to you, people don't know
Bless, you can see it
God, He come, He come, He come
He come depending what... what you do to people
Uh-huh
That's where bless come from, you know what I mean?
Yeah
You see, you can see that
Look at that, look at how fast President Reagan dead
You don't know him right?
Yeah, I did
Right okay, He was a criminal, you know what I mean?
But look at... at Jimmy Carter
Uh, uh
Jimmy Carter all... more older than Reagan
Uh, uh
Reagan gone already, Carter still here
The good person?
You know what I mean, 'cause he got a open heart
He never do war, when he was President
He never hurt nobody, he help people
