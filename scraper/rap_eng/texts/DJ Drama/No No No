She know a nigga' street
Vacation for a week
We sexing on the beach
And I ain’t taking ‘bout the drink
Open doors for her when I take her out to eat
I’m rolling up a sweet while she massage a nigga’ feet

Lil’ shawty so fine
I got her sipping wine
I tell her I don’t cheat
But she be knowing a nigga lyin’
Feds can’t stand me
They don’t understand me
While they ho hopping, I got her shopping in Miami

Everything’s G
Her friend's cuz bought a Jeep
Her bag a couple grand, and they compliments from me
See, I can be the king, and she can be my queen
And we can be a team
And fulfill eachother’s dreams
I love the way she talk
Love the way she walk
I’m always on her mind and she always in my thoughts
I got her at the house
We blowin’ on an ounce
I’m cooking dinner for her tonight
We ain’t going out

I meet a lot of hoes
Traveling on the road
Some I say yes, but some I say no
I be like “No no no, you can go go go”
Only fuck with bad bitches this is for my bad bitches

No Wonderbra
She got monster jaw
Like a porn star
Nice ass, nice job

I wear no star
So I’m bringing my entourage
Bust a gun and put it in the air
If you down with Gucci Gucci
Turn yo’ boy on to La Flare
Girl so fine just look at her and stare
Millions worth of ice on
No need to compare

Your jeweler is a loser
I think I might need a cooler
Or change that ring to ruler
Eat breakfast go to Sizzly
Wake up, eat lunch in Italy
Buy you all types of iced out ornaments
The trap boys do that normally
I’m like “No no no, if you ain’t a bad bitch you can go go go”

Started off as friends
But now we got a plan
I call her on her cellular
She’s calling me her man

Lets go to Japan
Maybe even France
Spend a hundred grand overseas
We holding hands

Gucci, Louis, Prada
It doesn’t even matter
I spoil her like my daughter
So she love me like her father

Cruising the Atlantic
Isn’t it romantic
Spaghetti strap dress
She ain’t wearing panties

Sex her on the couch
Freak her on the sink
I think tomorrow I might go buy her a mink… [2x]
