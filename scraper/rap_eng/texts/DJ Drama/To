[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
I know a couple girls like you
But they don't do it like you do
I hope we can go round two
'Cause you know I wanna do it again
I know a couple girls like you
But they don't do it like you do, yeah
I hope we can go round two
'Cause you know I wanna do it again, yeah

[Verse: Jesse Rutherford]
Being away from her, it makes me hurt, it makes me sad
I'll try to find another way to make it work
I hate to lurk, I'll never learn
But I hope I learn it sometime soon because
You better watch your mouth
I know everything that you're all about
I know what to say that will make you cry
But I know we're gonna do it again
I better watch my words
I know what to say that will make you hurt
I know what to say that will make you cry
But I know we're gonna do it again, oh

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
I know a couple girls like you
But they don't do it like you do
I hope we can go round two
'Cause you know I wanna do it again
I know a couple girls like you
But they don't do it like you do, yeah
I hope we can go round two
'Cause you know I wanna do it again, yeah
(Black and white!)

[Outro: Jesse Rutherford]
I know a couple girls like you
But they don't do it like you do (No, they don't)
I hope we can go round two (I hope we can)
'Cause you know I wanna do it again (Come right in the morning, babe)
I know a couple girls like you (When you're up in the morning, baby, yeah)
But they don't do it like you do (We can go round two)
I hope we can go round two (Oh, no, oh, no)
'Cause you know I wanna do it again
