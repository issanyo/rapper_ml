[Intro]
If you wanna fuck with me then you fuck with us
GDK with straps and we let em bust
Sefik finna pop out the fucking cut
Chopper turn your body into fucking dust

[Verse 1]
223 in my hand it go click clack
And my hitta's eat you up no Big Mac
Leave yo face lookin' ugly no Riff Raff
Got the work lookin' white no Tic Tac

This a warning to an opp no diss track
Got a glizzy got a Glock got a big gat
Imma leave you lookin' drunk no six pack
This that real drill time no bitch rap

Ya we smoke Lil Marc then we reload
Ya we smoke Lil Jeff then we reload
Never miss the open shot like a free throw
If you don't believe just ask Lil Jojo

Lookin out for the block with the 42
Never know what the Glock finna do to you
Got a shooter with some heat in the big coop
Catch a opper in the street it's Tooka part two

Shoot you down you a clown you is BDK
My team on attack cause we GDK
My team got the straps and we spray away
My team shoot a opp every single day

Sefik finna put a scope on Lil Jay
Nedim finna shoot you like a fadeaway
Tiro finna blitz you if you gotta pay
Ado finna empty out the Dirty K

You a pussy ass bitch you dont wanna play
My shooters let it rain like the sky was gray
Pullin' out the Mac 10's and you know they spray
Callin' out Lil Mouse i'm the cat today

BDK be some lames ya they fufu
Hittin' licks everyday make the pack move
Lil Scrappy, Young Pappy fuck you two
And don't forget we smokin' on Tutu

Got some hollow tips
In the fuckin clip
Shootin' at these opps man they gotta dip
Ya they gotta dip
Ya they gotta run
If I catch you with the drum then your life is done

Keep the heat keep the heat make your face melt
Ya I got a hot strap like a seat belt
Ya I got a 12 Gauge with some big shells
Free the homies locked up in the jail cells

Boy you know it's Chiraq so I ain't finished
Finna kill all the opps leavin no witness
Silencer on the gun but it's no different
Boy you know it's Chiraq so it's drill business
