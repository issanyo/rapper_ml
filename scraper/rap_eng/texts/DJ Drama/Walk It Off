The streets gone always be fucked

Now put lil Mac on the map if he walk it off
Now put lil Spitter on the map if he walk it off
Now put lil Poo on the map if he walt it off
Said put lil Fee on the map if he walk it off
Said put E.I on the map if he walk it off
K put lil Dre on the map if he walk it off
Said put lil Mark on the map if he walk it off
Ima......Ima

[Chorus:]
Ima good lookin rapper I ain't tryna stunt
Ima good looking rapper I ain't tryna stunt
Bitch Ima good looking rapper I ain't tryna front
Ima good lookin rapper I ain't tryna front
Hoe Ima good looking rapper I ain't lyin to you
Ima good lookin rapper I ain't lying to you
Ya might see me in a Bently painted royal blue
With a white interior on a set of 22's

[VERSE 1:]
Ima jalapeno boy, hot as cayenne pepper
Im from New Orleans city but I'll take ya to wherever
Im tougher than leather, Im smoother than suede
Always never broke cause Im usually paid
Got the Rover with the cage kinda brown off beige
Everybody look at me like I'm ridin on stage

Got a woman name Sage, she twice my age
Everytime she hit me up she send her picture with her page
I ain't tryna fall in love, I ain't tryna get engaged
You can meet me at the alter when a nigga really "dead"
Everytime Im tryna leave she beggin me to stay
And I politely fade away like my name was M.J
Then she wrote me a note, guess what that note say
Well I hope you still like me but I got both ways
And then I said O then I said ok
"Styled em up and got the fuck" like my name was O.J

If ya lookin for some money bitch my name is No Way
Not tomorrow, not today, not yesterday
Im Mr. President as they say and that Phantom fits me like its tailor made
I can take in a war nigga bombs away, I been in that war_on the Marmalades
If ya lookin for some money bitch my name is No Way
Not tomorrow not today not yesterday

[Chorus]

[VERSE 2:]
Last week I met a bitch but I forgot her name
Short, sweet, red, cute ol vibrant thang
She got a earring in her pussy and everywhere else
She say she jog everyday so she could cum on herself
Then she tell me my love is the best she's felt
Then she suck my dick like its about to melt
She drink vitamin water say its good for her health
She can wrap my whole dick around her waist like a belt

Then here's anotha bitch, her name was Aisha
She ride that dick good and make a mean cheese pizza
One time it was so good I told her order one more
She said, its not dominos its dijornos

Here's anotha bitch I met her at the gong show
Got her to the crib and turned it straight into a thong show
She do my dishes wash my clothes and fix my corn rolls
She do my diches wash my clothes and fix my corn rolls

I can't forget about my bitch name "E.T" Boo
She's a young project bitch I use to brang the hoe to school
So I brung the hoe to school, we standin on the yard
A bitch asked me was I from the 17th ward
Niggas came out the cut and started muggin me up
I grabbed the clip out my pocket and made them cowards duck
Then I told my ol lady Ill be back ya see, and hit me on my cell phone if niggas lookin fa me

[Chorus]

[VERSE 3:]
Now shake, slide, ride, twirk, jerk, giddy up
Jump, bounce on that dick and get the fuck get the fuck
Shake, slide, ride, twirk, jerk, and giddy up
Jump bounce on that dick and get the fuck get the fuck
My name is Lil Weezy they say I'm off the heezy
And I tell the dog hoe don't, don't ya be greedy

[Chorus]
