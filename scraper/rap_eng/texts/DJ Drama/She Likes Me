I think, I think, I think, I think she likes me
I think, I think, I think, I think she likes me
I think, I think, I think, I think she likes me
I think she likes me, I think she likes me

[Verse 1 - Jadakiss]
Lights off lights on uggs with the tights on
Even better when she's butt naked with my ice on
She know how to rock it but sometimes she holds the mic wrong
She just try to make every situation right for him
Keep that gushy tight for him clean wet white warm
Talk bad about him and she be ready to fight for him
Clean up nice for him low life nikes on em
You know it's the turbo when you hear the pipes on em
Nice day top down comin through the heights on em
Know I'm up in her, she scratch and she bites on em
Just something about her that excites me, hypes me
But its all good though cause I think she likes me

[Hook]
I think, I think, I think, I think she likes me
I think, I think, I think, I think she likes me
I think, I think, I think, I think she likes me
I think she likes me, I think she likes me

[Verse 2 - Nicki Minaj]
We was at the heat game, peep game, let him see the g-string
Yves St. Laurent, size fives, a petite frame
He like c'mon Nicki, really why you keep playin?
Said his name was Jada' I said ooh that's a unique name
I go and see him out in Yonkers in the back blocks
He in the matchbox ballin like the mascots
He said I'm dead hot pull up in the brass drop
I see them hatin ass bitches in the backdrop
That's why I kiss him right in front of them
He on't (don't) want none of them
Even when its dark I be son'n them
Plus I keep the thing, thing mighty tight
And if he think I like him then he might be right (Chyea)

[Hook]
I think, I think, I think, I think she likes me
I think, I think, I think, I think she likes me
I think, I think, I think, I think she likes me
I think she likes me, I think she likes me

[Verse 3 - Jadakiss]
Thuggin it, she lovin it
Talkin bout my ruggedness
Feelin her so much I let her call me by my government
Nice soft ass even softer when I'm rubbin' it
Gotta lotta cash but I'm tryna get some other grip
Stay straight fly right good taste high price
Type that you buy ice possibly my wife
Hips mean thighs tight
Works out rides bikes
Cause all that excites me and I think she likes me
WHAT?!

[Hook]
I think, I think, I think, I think she likes me
I think, I think, I think, I think she likes me
I think, I think, I think, I think she likes me
I think she likes me, I think she likes me
