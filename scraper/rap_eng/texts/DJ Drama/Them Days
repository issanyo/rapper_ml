[Verse 1]
Walks in the room and she side eyes like she’s bad for me
Bad for me and you look so good
Pick up your phone, I'm waitin' outside on my lone
Let me inside so I can take this where he won’t
I know it hurts your mind
That he’s not worth your time
It’s okay, I’m first in line
Shawty, I got that where you need that
Normally, I don’t catch feelings but I got some feelings for you
Droppin' the ceilin' for you
Know that this coupe was made for two

[Hook]
Worst thing about it is I know that you could find someone better
I could do you better than your nigga and your man and all of your exes
Fuckin' on the weekends, weekends turn to forever
The worst thing, shawty, I'm good for you but you deserve better
Sometimes, I love you but I can do better
Make love and I fuck you but I can do better
I'm caught in the streets with that brand new Beretta
Shawty, I'm good for you but you deserve better

[Verse 2]
Walks in the room with that give no fuck attitude, girl I love it
I'm playin' cool but I'm thinkin' that you look so good
I know what I want, top floor at the Viceroy
You're down, girl, and I know
And you know, no you don’t
No you ain’t gotta lie-da-da-da
Pull up on you tryna ride-da-da-da
Top down on the side-da-da-da
I want you to want me how I want you
And I know that you got it in you
From all of those times that I had to call in
I bring her that good to her one more time

[Hook]
Worst thing about it is I know that you could find someone better
I could do you better than your nigga and your man and all of your exes
Fuckin' on the weekends, weekends turn to forever
The worst thing, shawty, I'm good for you but you deserve better
Sometimes, I love you but I can do better
Make love and I fuck you but I can do better
I'm caught in the streets with that brand new Beretta
Shawty, I'm good for you but you deserve better
