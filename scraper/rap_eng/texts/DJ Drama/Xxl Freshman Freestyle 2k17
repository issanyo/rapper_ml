[Verse 1]
People don't believe in you
Until they see you succeed
When I'm coppin' them Rari's
They will see
When I'm going over the speed
They will see that I'm the best rapper
In the sea
I'm the best rapper in the industry
I'm droppin' bars so hard
They can't even see
It's like you're blind to that
I'm droppin bars like Kodak
I'm dropping stuff so fast
You don't even know that
Yo, I'm freestylin' straight
From the dome
I ain't writing this
I came up with this all alone
Straight from the membrane
Getting kinda insane
Getting deep into these lyrics
Man, it's driving me insane

[Chorus]
But we need to settle down
We don't want to wake the town
With the music that's bumping so loud
But we need to settle down
We don't want to wake the town
With the music that's bumping so loud

[Verse 2]
Trap God, Rap God
King Pat, beautiful swag on
[?] I'm the trap son
Moonwalking back: Michael Jackson
Gaining that buzz, gaining traction
You know I'm the main attraction
I'm tricking out to the song, man

[Outro]
Aye, this is KingPatB
