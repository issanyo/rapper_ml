[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
I got D on the block
We are the streets, you can ask the LOX
Go through the kitchen see the stains on the pots
Wasn't down with Roc-A-Fella but I was throwin' rock
I'm a self made nigga, payday nigga
I ball everyday, fuck what they say, nigga
I'm here to make ends in a big body Benz
And my baby momma mad I'm fuckin' all of her friends
The Vette out front, you could take a picture
Meet me on the hill, son bring Keri with ya
High school, I never went to class first
Now I fly first class, damn I'm the worst

[Hook: Red Cafe]
I'm self made, self made
Self made, self made
My bitch bad, my money long
My ride clean, the top gone

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I'm a self made nigga, Richcrest villain
Summer of '09 I made a mothafuckin' killin'
And I'mma be a thug nigga long as I'm livin'
Plugg called, homies locked up and Gotti's still dealin'
Two doors, no ceiling
Two whores but no feelings
One shot, no witness
Pussy ass nigga gettin' the mo' fuckin' business
"I got work on the streets", what make you wanna say that?
Snitches takin' notes and I don't even play that
AK sprayin' "da-da-da-da-dow"
Went from Mickey Mouse zeros nigga thats a hundred rounds

[Hook: Red Cafe]
I'm self made, self made
Self made, self made
My bitch bad, my money long
My ride clean, the top gone

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
Yeah I done went from oz' to lbs
I done went from Levi's to LV
From that White Star to that Ros√©
Them hoes used to say "naw" now it's "okaaaay"
Goin' hard as a porn star's nipples
Swagger on ten, multiply two nickles
Keep two bitches, I be in the middle
Like a Wednesday, I be in the middle
Self made nigga, Diddy co-signed
Grade A nigga with a grade A grind
Takin' yo' bitch, takin' yo' town
Make her kiss my ring, nigga bow down

[Hook: Red Cafe]
I'm self made, self made
Self made, self made
My bitch bad, my money long
My ride clean, the top gone
