Chorus:
Hard times is the past
Yea I made it out the struggle
Now I’m getting paid it ain't nothing to a hustler
I’m a go getter nigga
I can make it back up
I’m on a mission for commission
It ain't nothing to a hustler
The cars, the clothes, the jewelry the ho’s
The money, the power, the highs, the lows
The haters, the jackers, the friends, the foes
It all come with the game
It ain't nothing to a hustler

Verse 1:
No pain no gain
Yea bet it was right
So if god come today I’m ready tonight
I keep losing good niggas will it ever stop
Shed so many tears
I feel like Pac
But losses come with the game you gotta take one
Wish I could swap real niggas for these fake ones
You know bring a few back resurrect em
God don’t make mistakes so I respect em
Wish I could bring ? back that’s just one
Id do anything
Give up my left lung
So when death come, ill be ready for em
Any obstacle in my way ill be ready for em
Hurdle em
Yea I do a little track and field
Hit the booth
Pour out my pain get on a track and spill
I just tell em something real like Trey and Plies
Street nigga Im a hustler till the day I die

Chorus

Verse 2:
Bread over everything
Big money heavy chains
Heavy chains married to the game
Pinky wedding ring
Used to have my head in rain
Now I’m in them kush clouds
Now boppers break their neck
Just to point and yell “look kyl”
Had a good year like ties
Now im big spending
Livie in the galleria
I should pay rent here
Wells fargo, wamu
Chase bank, BOA
Im killing these niggas
Like Jay this DOA
No struggle no progress
I made it through that process
Now when I do my count
That’s the only time I stress
Count a stack scratch my head
Count another stack my bread
Now I’m pulling off the lot
Paper plates black and red
Hit the club and make a movie
Yea im on my benny boom
Vip full of ho’s
Add more there’s plenty room
While you niggas doing bad
Complaining bout your sad life
Im getting money doing my thing
Living the fast life

Chorus
