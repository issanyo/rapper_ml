Ayo, lotta y'all look like you could use my help, right?
People's rapper that's why I'm here for
Listen close, take notes, cause ever since I gotta deal nigga shit been crazy
New hoes man acting like they be there from the beginning
And the chicks that were there from the beginning start acting brand new, god damn...

[Bridge 1]
Fake chick, she 'bout to laugh it all my jokes
Slut chick she been probably fuck with all my folks
This deal gonna change your life kid, I knew that when I signed it
Got a LA chick and a girl at home
But your LA chick gonna make you leave your girl back home

[Verse 1]
That's the shit niggas told me about
That's the shit mama got on me about
Mama always said when a nigga status getting higher
Girls hair get longer and their skin get brighter
But ain't no rules now me and their friends fucking
Couldn't hit when I was broke, I call it revenge fucking
I'm loving this shit
Had a chick so bad, I was thinking man I can't believe I'm fucking this bitch
I had to seen bullshit when I've been on the road
Made me wonder what my girl do when I ain't home
Will she be a freak still if she met Meek Mill
Would she go back on the trailer on her own free will
She forget about me if she met Jay-Z
Hoes spaz when they see nigga they seen on TV
So be careful who you take to the industry show
Turn you girl back home to a industry hoe
All my niggas say hoe
Fuck around and fall in love with a hoe
Yeah I'm handsome but I understand a lot of money in the room
Baby try to keep your pants on
Pants on the floor 'fore I open the door
Wasn't this easy when I use to open the show
Now I'm closing the show hoes all in the row
Finding out good girls really hoes on the low

[Bridge 2]
She went a week without you
And forgot all about you
She wanna talk it out but ain't nothing to talk about, shit
Gave it up to a nigga with clout
And now she tryna work it out, work it out, work it out, work it out now
Ain't no way that y'all work it out

[Verse 2]
I remember when I thought I had a down ass bitch
Looking like bozo fucking this clown ass bitch
When I still ain't signed, ain't rich but I was tryin'
Always lyin', have me takin' care of kids that wasn't mine
Probably bitch shouldn't get it but I really didn't get it
Legs open like Wallgreens 24/7, I said it, I said it
Let any nigga hit it, legs open like Walgreen's 24/7
More money, more effort
Didn't make it no better she can only take advantage if you motherfucker let her, wait
Money ain't make her no better but she only take advantage
When you motherfucker let her
Home boy this ain't a song, it's a fucking open letter
This food for thought pass me the salt and pepper
Let's talk about sex baby girl salt and pepper
She know I don't give a fuck so a fuck is all I give her
[Pause]
Now could I make it any clearer after a good ride
Send her back to the dealer
Don't let me hit at you
Gone in a minute too
Bigger truth, hoes lie just like niggas do
Figure she just hit another nigga 'fore she visits you
Fuck so many niggas you should make her take a physical
Think she don't like fucking you she just fuckin' in general
Eeny, meeny, miny pick whoever ever they can hit it too
Tryin' to change a bitch make a motherfucker miserable
Leave 'em before they leave you, before they leave you with a ridicule
Try to figure out why she a whore will fucking riddle you
When she send a message, send a nigga and she good to do
Seeing is believing find out she was despicable
Never let another bitch have me looking pitiful
Lies, jealousy, you don't know what got into you
In love like you don't know what you done committed to
Tell her that you love her cause you thought she was committed too
Go out of town every night she went with a different dude
You was try to change her, dog I feel your pain cause
You was try to treat like she's special
She let anybody bang her, look
Niggas lie, bitches lie, we're all in the bullshit and don't know why
You want you a good girl but son don't try
They better they self don't want help and that's fine
Be clear I see hoes of all kind
So I don't waste words or my motherfucking time, uh...
