Haha, back at it
Baby, I'ma make a wish and I want you to make one
Nah, don't tell me yet, we can talk 'bout that later
DJ Drama

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I ain't like them other niggas, you see that I'm different
I creep on the late night, I stay on a mission
Got all types of different bitches
Pussy wet and dripping, I feel like sipping
I eat the pussy with precision
6 rings, Jordan, Pippen
I do gymnastics with a brick and flip it
Money to the ceiling, no, I ain't tripping
No conversation
These niggas bitches be texting and sending emojis
But no, I don't say shit
He try to hang with the homies but tell on the gang
Boy, you a straight bitch
And now your girl coming over give me that booty
Know it's amazing, loving these bitches
Got into trouble with bitches, can't fuck with these bitches

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, you know who I am
And girl, I know just who you are (Hol' up)
We ain't gotta rush into shit
'Cause being in love is too hard (Hol' up)
I'm tired of all these flashing lights
Girl, we should just fuck in the dark
Once you let me hit it
I'ma get to switching, different positions
Have that ass wishing that I was your nigga (Ooh, woah)
Wishing that I was your nigga, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wishing that I was your nigga, yeah
Once you let me hit it
I'ma get to switching, different positions
Have that ass wishing that I was your nigga

[Verse 2: LyQuin]
I know you got niggas, why you wanna be mines?
On your tippy toes when I hit her from behind
Oh my God, shawty, I ain't even lyin'
What you know 'bout me, 'bout me?
Playin' with the D, girl, will have you in the zone
Make a movie how you climaxin' in my phone (Brrp, brrp)
Got that Nia Long, now you gotta a Love Jones for me
Now you after that, ride on this dick 'til you crash in that
Flippin' and turnin' you up in the air like a acrobat
Turn on the camera, this movie we makin' is action packed
Safe sex is great sex, that's a wrap, Quin

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, you know who I am
And girl, I know just who you are (Hol' up)
We ain't gotta rush into shit
'Cause being in love is too hard (Hol' up)
I'm tired of all these flashing lights
Girl, we should just fuck in the dark
Once you let me hit it
I'ma get to switching, different positions
Have that ass wishing that I was your nigga (Ooh, woah)
Wishing that I was your nigga, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wishing that I was your nigga, yeah
Once you let me hit it
I'ma get to switching, different positions
Have that ass wishing that I was your nigga

[Verse 3: Skeme]
Pull up on me and my shawty
I show you I fuck with you strong
I'm on that 12 Play, I promise you, baby
I don't see nothin' wrong
With you pullin' up to the house
And me fuckin' you on this couch
I got long paper, ain't got no neighbors
So no one gon' hear when you shout
Baby, just come through for me tonight
You the best, promise you I'm with the shits
I ain't got too much to do, ain't got nothin' to do
Ain't got nothin' 'cept you on the list
Baby, I know all your spots
So say is you with it or not?
'Cause once I fuck you like I wanna fuck you, girl
You gon' wanna tie up the knot, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, you know who I am
And girl, I know just who you are (Hol' up)
We ain't gotta rush into shit
'Cause being in love is too hard (Hol' up)
I'm tired of all these flashing lights
Girl, we should just fuck in the dark
Once you let me hit it
I'ma get to switching, different positions
Have that ass wishing that I was your nigga (Ooh, woah)
Wishing that I was your nigga, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wishing that I was your nigga, yeah
Once you let me hit it
I'ma get to switching, different positions
Have that ass wishing that I was your nigga

[Outro: Chris Brown & DJ Drama]
Quality Street Music, and like that
Wishing that I was your nigga

Wishing that I was your nigga
Oh, oh, wish I was yours
Haha, wishing that I was your nigga
Breezy, holla at me
