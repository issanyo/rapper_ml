[Verse:]
Mixtapes made me a king
Mixtapes made me a legend
Mixtapes made me a brand
More than anything mixtapes made success come to me
Might be a lot of places
You know it’s the reason why
They call me the mixtape president
I guess you can say God bless the mixtapes
It’s the one and only DJ Drama
You know what I mean
What else is there to say
