[Verse 1:  Soulja Boy]
Soulja Boy Tell'Em, she bad like a student in detention
Walk inside the club and my chain just glistening
Soulja Boy Tell'Em, yeah I got Chris with me
I bet I drank the bottle until that bitch empty
Gucci belt plus Louis when I hop up out my Phantom
Turn my swag on, all the girls say I'm handsome
I maybe in my Lambo or my jet, it doesn't matter
She bad, she bad, she bad, but she’s badder

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
She looking at me, I'm thinking that she
That she bad than a mother
She staring at me, I'm thinking that she
She a fine mothersucka
She a fine mothersucka, and I think I love her
Ooh I think she likes me, I’ll keep her through the summer
Ride me like a wave, have you screaming "Cawabunga"
Bubble bootylicious, make a nigga wanna pop her

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Let me know just how you want it
Watch how quick I get up on it
Once I get up on your body
Shawty I’mma keep it rocking

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
But she never been with a dude like me who do it like I do
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
But she never been with a dude like me who do it like I do

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
She looking at me I’m thinking
That she that she badder than a mother
That juicy booty got me thinking
That’s she the daughter of a trucker
She’s the daughter of a trucker, booty like a Mack truck
Pull up to her bumper, love the way she back it up
Say I got a lot of talk, shorty, I can back it up
When I put it on her, shorty just can’t get enough

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Let me know just how you want it
Watch how quick I get up on it
Once I get up on your body
Shawty I’mma keep it rocking

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
But she never been with a dude like me who do it like I do
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
But she never been with a dude like me who do it like I do

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
Man she so beautiful she so super straight
In the club getting dollars, yeah she getting paid
She bad, she bad, she badder
Hop up in my Jag, my Jag, my Jaguar
Pull up in my Jag with the ice cream paint
I need a 150 thousand just to watch me blink
Baby girl fine and her outfit paint
Let’s leave this club, heavy to my place
I'm like man, she so beautiful, she so super straight
In the club getting dollars, yeah she getting paid
She bad, she bad, she badder
Hop up in my Jag, my Jag my Jaguar

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
But she never been with a dude like me who do it like I do
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too
But she never been with a dude like me who do it like I do
