[Lil Wayne]
The first time I realized I was the best rapper alive
You know what I mean, now before I go into any further in this conversation
Let me let y'all know what I mean about this best rapper alive shit

See y'all niggas ain't playing close attention right now
Ay Drama, this is what I want you to do man
This is what I really need you to do right now
My nigga Drama, plus he be hitting y'all in the head with that gangster shit
But listen, my nigga Drama man I swear I need you to do
I need you to give me something else for ya now
Just to warm 'em up, and then they gonna...
