[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
Even though you're fine as fuck, we're just making matters worse
Go from us kissing to you burning my stuff, what you wanna break shit for, did you buy this? No
Girl what the hell yo think this is? I think you really need to stop this shit
Cause I’m not gon' have it, it was fun while it lasted, but this ain't love no

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
No, no, this ain't love, love no
Every night, fuss and fight, something ain't right
With us, girl cause we rushed this love
Neither one of us can blame the other
So maybe we should say goodbye
We can make this kiss the last kiss goodnight, tonight
So maybe we should say goodbye
Go our separate ways, hey, let's, call it quits

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
We gotta stop this thing between us, girl you're 'bout to make me cuss you out
Kick you up out my house, here’s your clothes there’s a door and go shawty
On your birthday now my shawty number 2 gon' be in 1st place
To the main chick cause I'm not gon' have it, it was fun while it lasted, girl you got to go

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
No, no, this ain't love, love no
Every night, fuss and fight, something ain't right
With us, girl cause we rushed this love
Neither one of us can blame the other
So maybe we should say goodbye
We can make this kiss the last kiss goodnight, tonight
So maybe we should say goodbye
Go our separate ways, hey, let's, call it quits
