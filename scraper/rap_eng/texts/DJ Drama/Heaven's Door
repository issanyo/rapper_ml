[Verse 1: Count]
Yeah (x4)
My jewelry game off the chain
I got the stick-up man thinking I'm a walking stain
Shit, my pinkie ring appraised for a hundred grand
And while you're talking, my stones is flawless like the son of man

Now, I understand why niggas stare at me
Cause apparently, they've never in their life seen ice
With so much clarity
The streets say they want to get at me,  they probably do
Shit, I don't blame 'em, if I was them, I'd want to ride me too

Just because I'm rapping, I'm famous
Don't forget the fact I'm a gangster
I got Ks and the Macs
So yeah, I come strapped with them bangers
Get to clapping them bangers, you better let 'em know
They run up on me, they be knocking on heaven's door

[Chorus/Hook: ?]
Before you try to pull it, I should let you know
You'll be knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
I'll send you to a place you've never seen before
You'll be knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door

[Verse 2: Moonie]
You keep knock knocking 'til you get an answer
You must be kidding if you telling me to put my hands up
You in the [?] and I be in some handcuffs
They're reading your obituary, they're reading my Miranda

But fuck a damn judge, I follow street law
Eye for a eye, you know? That's proper protocol
Think you're mister know-it-all
But I never show it all
I got killers running through them pins like a bowling ball

So don't be alarmed, because you'll be [at awe?]
I paint a perfect picture, you'll be a work of art
White tee as canvas, all types of burgundy
Thinking that it's abstract, but I did it purposely

[Chorus/Hook]
