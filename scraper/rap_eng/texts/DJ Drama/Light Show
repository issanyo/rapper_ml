[Hook: Yo Gotti & Gucci Mane]
The light show

Come check out the light show
Gotti at the light show
Gucci at the light show
Light show light show welcome to the light show
My my my look at that ice
Them boys looking bright tonight
Light show light show it's like we in a light show
Light show light show it's like we in a light show
Hoes recognize the way we rocking that ice
Girl you better watch your eyes
Neck glow, wrist glow, welcome to the light show
Light show light show it's like we in a light show

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Green light, yellow light fire red hot light
Shorty seen my chest, thought that she was at a stop light
White light, blue light like I'm in a cop car
Yellow gold yellow ice I do it for the trap star
Black light that shit kind of hot but I bought it anyway
Mascot, you in Bs like I made all As
Blue ice sit on my wrist call it my uncle snoop
New chain when I jump out my chain match the coupe
Ice tray open my mouth it's like a cold front
Severe weather headed to Memphis sleeting all month
Gotti must be back off the road, you niggas damn right
And Imma bring that snow to the hood just like my niggas like

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I jumped in the rap game I didn't have a name yet
But I had a stupid chain and fruity bracelet
Blue and yellow Jacob
Gucci mane the glacier
Higher than a martian cause I roll around in spaceship
Yep, the dog so god damn pretty
Stone same color Michael Jackson after surgery, heard me?
Man my watch is gorgeous
All the diamonds flawless
My jewelry boss retarded
That's how you know I'm balling
Bracelet humongous going to my armpit
Diamond watches watching
So we turned on the light switch
Bracelet humongous going to my armpit
Diamond watches watching
So we turned on the light switch
