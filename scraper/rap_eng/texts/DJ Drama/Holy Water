[Hook]
You can have whatever you want
You put your mind to it
You had it hard in this world
You deserve the finer shit
You your brothers keeper to the reaper
And everything out the crew don't matter
Ain't give a fuck about you either

[Verse 1]
Every year I need 300
Mountain of heads that have no imperfections
And think their shit smell like Hermes
Your career shut off ain't have no legs
Run your mouth now you beg
Pardon my shoulder I can't vouch for the reg
Catch me hundred dollar billing
RIP to Chillin'
I gotta keep on winning
Probably never gon get some sleep im forever spinning
Revolver door when sinning we graduated from a torn beginning
Kick hood slang to foreign women
I was brought up on a different strip
3 of us and 1 mill we gon split this shit
Burning out wheels I hit my lick shit
They want our backs bleeding
Whether whip or macs squeezing
Turn the ghetto unbelievers murder all our black leaders
And you jeopardize your freedom for a fresh designer season
Classy restaurants when eating
Ego don't get along with reason
Son died this evening and his little man is teething
He's in good arms the South side Jamaica jungle for 'em

[Verse 2]
Angels in my sleep too sweet beg me to flee
I'm thinking how can I be ready
Heavy shit on my mind this eve
My talent helps me get to it that means a lot to me
And copying is a form on flattery
This many watching and see
They want your paper thin so you can kick it all day with them
Get major when your names engraved
Within the book of Kings
You got Judas ways jumping and your jealous
They juxing justice, left hook to busters
Lets celebrate the crooks amongst us
Ain't no love apparently I'm having visions
Parrying my parasites I should have five mics for this one
I climb heights with rhythm my minds twice my victim's
Recline nights I'm picking I've nine types of bitches
I'm breathtaking give you blue face dollars to match it
Word to my OG and my clue tapes I'ma go classic
Dawg I'm everywhere they screw face problem with plastic
Destined to make it since my due date
Momma's lil bastard

[Verse 3]
Crushing down a gooey zip
Razor under fitteds get your screwy ripped
Put on my Louie shit bust a Uwe dip
Boy who you confuse me with
Bow and worship ground
Duck an uzi clip
You ain't gotta give me five shoot me it
Live from the 718 Jamaica's gates surround that crooked Cold Corner nines on us to make us straight
Ain't no fear here only faith
Think all your want still can't prepare for homie sake
Part of my grimy mistake
I save my 16s on a crate
2015 on a split screen with the cape
You are listening to a great
I'm in grind mode your minds be blindfold
Tell them you help me time you lie told
Divide the guy code back off the plate
Wait, there gotta be some more to this life
Than dollar signs and ice and ghetto nights a roll of the dice
Corny niggas in my audio vice
Grimy boroughs make the shortys go trife
Can't be a have-not all of your life
