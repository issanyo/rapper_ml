[Intro]
Jeezy the snowman I make it winter time
Heard the streets hungry so its dinner time
Watchin as they patrol, they patrol the state
Jeezy the snowman I patrol the weight

[Verses 1]
36 o's for the nin-teen five front door service u ain't even gotta drive
Stacks on deck, fuck what a hater think
Lotta dead white boys equal money in the bank
CTE is the clique that I claim
Know some real niggas that claim the same thing (yep)
They dont want war these, niggas want peace
72 karats on my snowman piece
I'm dope boy fresh, 4X black tee
And theres a million muthafuckas feelin just like me
We roll them fat like that Oprah bitch
Color purple, all smoke is that purple shit
See the red dogs run like black cats
Toss the work but I'm holding on to my strap
Hustla music we call it trap-hop,
A whole lot of baking soda in a glass pot
