[ Intro: Wale ]
Love love love like this
Gotta be something for me write this
Im sayin one night my love is like that
Shawty don’t like me then shawty don’t like dick

[DJ Drama]
You know that love is a very serious thing
If you don’t watch out
Love is gonna get you

[ Verse 1: Wale ]
She say she love me more than anything
I tell her anything i’m such a rumor I never hear her wedding ring
Bad women with bad figures, Im trying to get em
My bread grown, my sex better, my mind different
And you would think that i’m European, my tribe different
I’m not a mister but Ive been playing with side bitches other plan w
My game tighter than bitches that ain't fuck in forever
Ok drama the affiliate
Bitches think i’m trippin but I Ramen noodle dinner Em'
Just before they seen my money in the green
You niggas in the red, I am somewhat the illiterate
She wanna see me again, She trying see me for dinner
Im trying to see her in bed
Don’t like to see when she talk
I like to see where she been and i’ll be deep in her mind
Cause i’ll be deep in her ribs
Can't break up to make up,she wake up, im out
And I make her lips stick, no make up to mouth
Ugh, and that's gross but she love it though
A nigga ghost every time youngin on the flow
And when she not, have her feeling like she on a boat
Used to nun-chuck em, now I got to Donatello Bow
Haa, this is something they already know
They more they come, the less likely the want to go
Wale

[ Verse 2: Talia Coles ]

It’s my fault
I should have known from the start boy
Im that you would go and steal my heart away
Im drowning down, I couldn't dodge the wave
Somebody save me babe
You remind me of a love I used to know
Playing with fire is a danger zone

[ Hook: Talia Coles ]

I wish i’ll never see you again
I wish i’ll never see you again
I wish i’ll never see you again
I wish i’ll never see you again

[ Verse 3: Talia Coles ]

Everything was picture perfect till you moved the frame
And now because of you Its barely hangin'
Boy in a flash its like you start to replace him
That photograph is fading
You remind me of a love I used to know
Playin with fire is a danger zone

[ Hook: Talia Coles ]

[Bridge: Talia Coles ]

From the time that you stole my heart
You shook my world and it felt apart
Trying to get away, but I think Im stuck
Trying to get back to this thing called love

[ Hook - Talia Coles ]

I wish i’ll never see you again
I wish i’ll never see you again
