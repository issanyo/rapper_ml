[Intro: Future]
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it

[Hook: Future]
A bitch gon' be a bitch, a ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer - that's something you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gon' be a dealer, a plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, we just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it

[Verse 1: Future]
I had a young, hot thang fucked my bro and gave 'em brain
And she expect for me to love her, I can never be a lame
I'm attracted to her sexually, but she ain't my main dame
We can be the best of friends, shawty, but you off the chain
See I ain't gonna hold it against ya
I'mma keep it pimping with ya
Don't you come at me with issues
Ain't tryna get all in your mixture
I ain't tryna come to get ya
You can meet me somewhere on Peach street
At the W on the Fourteenth
Ain't tryna fuck no ho tryna know me
And they wanna fuck my woodie, already smashed the homie
Half of these bitches phony, singing love songs like Toni
Ms. Braxton you the action, stop acting
Just another sad love song waiting to happen

[Hook: Future]
A bitch gon' be a bitch, a ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer - that's something you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gon' be a dealer, a plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, we just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
A killer gonna' be a killer, that's regardless
Of the fact that I'm Tin Man, heartless
No love for ya' baby
Unless you walkin' through my living room braless
With your nipples pokin' through ya wife beater, you the mic eater
She doing Daddy Fat Stacks soon as I meet her
Get it meet her
Cut to the chase like a cheetah cause she want that PETA
Pipe her down, gon' wipe her clown
When so many niggas un-wiped her down
You hopin' that she gon' turn her life around
Up out face, a full one-eighty
A ho into a housewife, that's your lady and me
I never give another but a dope baby
With a good time and a dope dick
She love the way I talk and my flow slick
Ain't no way around it
Yo-yo-yo-yo-your bitch in love with my dick
But Big don't love her at all
Let a monkey nigga pay the bills while I scrub them jaws
Like a test for DNA, TNA, we the A

[Hook: Future]
A bitch gon' be a bitch, a ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer - that's something you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gon' be a dealer, a plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, we just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
Ball so had I need Ace of Spades
Livin' life through these ray bans
Drop four, whipped up eight man
How you do that, got great hands
I ain't seen you niggas like Ray Charles
Figure I'll drive these eight car
Trynna' figure how I'ma fuck these eight hoes
Same time increase my bank roll
Broke shit had my vision blurred
So I went and copped me a quarter bird
Got me a job got work to do
Need a job nig got work for you
Hood lil' niggas die by respect
Niggas bleeding what they readin' on the internet
Where ya' from nigga? Where ya' plug?
Just like I thought, niggas silent thugs
That is a job fuck niggas hate
Why you think I'm carrying this seven-eight
Twenty-two rounds that'll keep me straight
If I ain't got that then I make and bake
Been gettin' money since baby Nate
Red monkey, I'mma watch junkie
Ain't no way really 'round that
Made them young niggas screaming, "where the pounds at?"
What

[Hook: Future]
A bitch gon' be a bitch, a ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer - that's something you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gon' be a dealer, a plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, we just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
