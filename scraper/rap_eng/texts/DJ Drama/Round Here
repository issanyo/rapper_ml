I mean we do everythin' extra extravagant, you know. I'm super special with my shit, very lavish. You know what I'm sayin'? If Trina was here, she'd say, she'd say, very, very, very geechy vibe. You know how the fuck I get down. It's young Fargo, put the money in the duffle. Brittney Taylor, kill a bitch in every flavor. Let's get paper, baby. We gon' keep stuntin' on the world and puttin' trunks in the front. And droppin' tops, anybody at the top can be dropped on. And Nyce, you my nigga right now, So I gotta tell you to tell these niggas something. 'Cause I can't really get to them right now, so tell these niggas get the fuck better and get a life, get a life
