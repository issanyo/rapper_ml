[Interlude - DJ Drama]

R.I.P Mark Duggan

[Verse 1]

Feeling like I hit a glass ceiling
Reminiscing on the days sex had a feeling
Now I'm on some shit like if she's pretty than I'm beating
Lauren left my heart oi, I’m just getting even
I'm spending money on things I know I shouldn't
'Cause it was only yesterday when I couldn't
Eyes wide, no I ain't sleeping on competition
I've seen it happen to spitters I thought it wouldn't
I myself who’s getting spoiled by the day
Coupled man around me changed, I stayed the same
You get it in, watch, they'll despise ya
Young paid in full star, real Mekhi Phifer
So big up everyone that grew where I did
Kicked out of school looking to do what I did
Elevate up out the hood and live where I live
From Aquas to Rollies it's all in timing
See if you feel me you can pull it fam
Wrong place, wrong time, couple times I couldn’t plan
More times I do it to say I did it, man
That’s why I fucked a couple girls I shouldn’t have
Living and Learning, dying and earning
Dug and dive, the whole city's burning
Rest in peace, pop your T's
And fuck the newspapers misquoting my tweets
Imagination running wild, imagine
Imagine that I am now living out things thing that I imagined
Half the mil profit got the tax man yappin'
My accountant better make summin' happen
Headphones on now I'm watching the throne
Reality wasn't real so I created my own
And if I put up on my status that I'm feeling alone
It doesn't mean holla me - leave me alone

[Hook]

Yeah, just let it breathe x3
I ain't even crippin' but I'm throwing up a C
Yeah, just let it breathe x3
I ain't even crippin' but I’m throwing up a C

[Verse 2]

Still blood in blood out, we don't fuck about
You’'e just an athletic pussy, all you do is run your mouth
You on some wasteman ting, I'm on this great tip
I just get pampered, I don't take shit
I call this my turn a hater to a fan flow
Understand before the paper there's a plan bro
I ain't tryin' to spend every time I see something
For I don't think anybody broke see it coming
What's the deal nigga? What's the deal?
You're luke warm nigga, I'm hot for real
Working on the structure 'cause I know I got the skills
Labels shop for me's, I don't shop for deals
Spitters know I make them powerful moves
I had a meeting with some powerful jews
Negotiate with a poker face
Play it straight and
One day you can be powerful, too
These fools wanna see COD
Whatever man Shallo roll more weed
Life's just a game called make more P
You niggas just COD
I'm in my zone, Ciroc is the remedy
So much to do and I just haven’t got the energy
You see writing bars helps me mentally
Because the word rap is in therapy
If you get it, you get it, you're on my wavelength
Bitches ain't money and that's why I never save them
It ain't a thing, I swear it ain't a thing
I'm just doing mine, everybody do your ting

[Hook]
