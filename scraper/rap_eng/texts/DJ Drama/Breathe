(Intro: Yamine)
Hey. hey. let's go


[pre-hook:Yamine]
Oh. oh. oh. oh. oh.oh. oh.oh.oh
Yeah
Oh.oh.oh. oh. oh.oh.oh.oh.oh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Yamine]
Too nice and too slay
I love you so much I can call you my bay
Her name Is B, doesn't start with an A
I got plenty shoes and she never make it rain
I'm running out of air that I have to refrain
I'm running out of air that I have to refrain
Me and JB just got introduced into the game
What a shame figure
All this money on me they know that I cause the triggers
Two more rounds of ammo left that I kill the killers
Like Gucci Mane always says "forget them niggas"
Now I'm all RnB and I'm making Kickers

[Hook: Miya]
One foot in front of the other
Just breathe we'll find it together
Take me where the sun never sets
Find me where the sunset never ends

[Verse 2: Yamine]
Oh. yeah
I've been wondering
How long it is gonna end
Broken heart, broken friendship
I don't know what I can do that's it
You know what we do when we sin
I start acting stupid and that's an end
All this money doesn't mean nothing
I had a special girl, but she blew through me
I don't trust these hoes, cuz they new to me
Every one of them is the same
But this special girl isn't she's sane
She keeps to herself
And also finds her way
And I know how much I say this but
"JB comes up and say"

[Hook: Miya]
One foot in front of the other
Just breathe we'll find it together
Take me where the sun never sets
Find me where the sunset never ends
