[Verse 1]
I got that long money, so is my dick
Change my pamper homie cause I'm on that new shit
My chains too big, 150 stacks
And the yacht looking something like a cruise ship
I got that long money, so is my dick
Change my pamper homie cause I'm on that new shit
I got that long money, so is my dick
Change my pamper homie cause I'm on that new shit
My chains too big, 150 stacks
And the yacht looking something like a cruise ship
Roll with me, we could float away
And we can hop in the jacuzzi filled with Ros√©
Or that ace of spades, yeah it cost a grip
Stunting on shawty, she a bad chick

[Pre-Chorus]
I will take you down if you let me do it, do it
Girl you can get all of me if you let me do it, do it yeah

[Chorus]
Shawty when I do my thing, I ain't gon' stop, wanna hear my name when you on top
Cause you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, girl you know I'm too freaky yeah
Girl I put in work lemme do my job, call me bang bang cause I go so hard
Girl you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, girl you know I'm too freaky yeah

[Verse 2]
Wait babe, won't you come over and play babe? Bet you I can make that na na sing
Have you in the kitchen licking your plate clean, all up on the counter
Lady, have you had it good lately
I'mma give you what you need, right now, now, now, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I will take you down if you let me do it, do it
Girl you can get all of me if you let me do it, do it yeah

[Chorus]
Shawty when I do my thing, I ain't gon' stop, wanna hear my name when you on top
Cause you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, girl you know I'm too freaky yeah
Girl I put in work lemme do my job, call me bang bang cause I go so hard
Girl you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, girl you know I'm too freaky yeah
Shawty when I do my thing, I ain't gon' stop, wanna hear my name when you on top
Cause you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, girl you know I'm too freaky yeah
Girl I put in work lemme do my job, call me bang bang cause I go so hard
Girl you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, girl you know I'm too freaky yeah
