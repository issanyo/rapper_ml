[Intro: Willie The Kid]
Yeah, Willie The Kid
Bright lights, street lights

[Verse 1: Willie The Kid]
Summertime in apartment 409
Had to clean up the kitchen with 409
It was cookin' up work, while my granny at work
My big cuz, he ain't understand me at first
The court room or the casket
I'm like dude, either way you need cash and a nice suit
The street lights where I found my strength
Be with four rich men and you bound to be the fifth
Let's go

[Chorus: Lloyd]
I lost my daddy at a early age
Told my mama, don't cry for me
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday
Oh, how much different my life would be
But that's in my dreams, back to reality
Tryna get outta these street lights
So I won't have to live this street life
No more, no more
No more, no more, no

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
Just gotta learn to deal with problems
If you're young and from slum with no father
Got killed when you was little, still got mama
She tried to tell him go to school but why bother
When gettin' paid is the only way to solve 'em
Seems the stars get farther and farther
Out of my reach, out of these streets
Will they ever make it big?

[Chorus Lloyd]
'Cause I lost my daddy at a early age
Told my mama, don't cry for me
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday
Oh, how much different my life would be
But that's in my dreams, back to reality
Tryna get outta these street lights
So I won't have to live this street life
No more, no more
No more, no more, no

[Break: Lloyd & T.I.]
I ain't ashamed to say that I shed a tear
Thinkin' 'bout my dad, I wish I had him back
I'd give up everythin' just to have him here
After this storm and rain I have no fear
Gotta keep holdin' on, hold my head up strong
I know it won't be long
I'm livin' for the moment
Until we'll be together again, fo real
If I could turn that to this
Surely you could turn this to that

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Hey, I was born with the hustle, never been a sucka
Daddy wasn't in the crib, that made me tougher
Momma struggled with the bills, that made me stuff up
Powder in a sack which made me dumber
Now I'm standin' on the corner, bag full of marijuana, crack
Pistol in my pocket for anybody who disrespect
In the trap chillin' where robbers and killers kick it at
My arms up in the feds for ten, they say I'm goin' in
Ha, bet that I'm a stretch that, backish to this rappers
Show these niggas what I'm best at
Get a lil' check, flip it and invest that
Years later, oh now you see what my heads at
Like meals chasers, we be everywhere the bread at
You keep on hatin', you'll be layin' where the dead at
You rappers suckers, you can tell them that I said that
If nothin' else but the hustle, you gon' respect that

[Chorus: Lloyd]
I lost my daddy at a early age
Told my mama, don't cry for me
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday
Oh, how much different my life would be
But that's in my dreams, back to reality
Tryna get outta these street lights
So I won't have to live this street life
No more, no more
No more, no more, no

[Outro: Lloyd]
Guess this is my life and I wanna live it right
I don't wanna run the streets no more, no
Guess this is my life and I wanna live it right
I don't wanna run the streets no more, no
