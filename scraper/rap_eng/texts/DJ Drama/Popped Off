[Intro: DJ Drama]
We back at it, the wait is over
Dr. Dre, T.I.P.,
This shit is special

[Verse 1: T.I.]
See a party ain't a party 'til the Doc walk in it
It's hard to get it started 'til I hopped off in it
Then it got so crunk one minute
Since you didn't get to witness, just listen
I came in hot, and then I saw
As soon as I arrived then the shit popped off
The shit popped off
It's officially a gangsta party
You can leave, if she came to party
Then the shit popped off (popped off)
Shit popped off (popped off)
Niggas hands in the air, bitches takin' tops off
Put the chronic in the air, and the shit popped off

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
It's been awhile since you've heard these beats
You're malnourished
But he's back now, to flood these streets
They shall flourish
Others try but they lack courage
In fact, this track was on the back burner, it leaked
So back to the lab I had to go
But it was too magical, so
Here, doctor smack a ho's back, ask if it's tactical, (sure is)
Girl, I hope your vaginal has endurance
Cause I'm about to do somethin' tragical
Rest assure this
Cause homie hit the OE flow, you know me from before
But you don't know me like this, so do see do
Get on top of me and ride it like a rodeo, ho
I'll have you OD'ing on dick, this belong to your soul
Felonious, I'll kill your loneliness
But only just for, one night
Yeah that was fun, right? But I gotta go
I got a bottle of Mo and fo' mo' lil' mommy's
Lookin' like models, waitin' at the do' inside of my ho-tel
All ready to swallow and yo, follow the flow and traffic to the top flo'
And you gonna smell a lot of Merlot, a lot of chronic for sho'
Gin and tonic sold from the top to the bottom, let's go

[Hook: Unknown and (Dr. Dre)]
Order some more bottles, come on momma
Would you like a drink on me?
To me it's no problem if you wanna, baby come and drink with me
(She take it off at the do', she take it off for the do'
Get that ass on the flo', go, go)
To me, there's no problem if you wanna, baby come drink with me

[Verse 3: T.I]
Bright lights, late nights
Drop auto-mobiles outside hotels with a lot of hoes
Bottles poured, blow a lot of dro, no powder though
Everywhere you tryin' to go, I been a long time ago
Swag done surpassed, my style is so spazz, I pop tags daily
Drop Phantom, four eighty
Walk up in the place, and all the ladies go crazy
Want to get impregnated but all they need is throat babies
They runnin' up and askin'
"Is it true you know Shady
Dr. Dre be hangin' out with you, for real?" Ho chill
Like a magnet attracted to a nigga gettin' money
I tell 'em, "Kneel down, suck a nigga dick or somethin'"
Rubberband poppin' off the bank roll
Hoppin' out the champagne Rolls, with the automatic do's
Pockets on swoll, both wrists so froze
King of the South, balls out on the West Coast
Let's toast

[Hook: Unknown Dr. Dre]
Order some more bottles, come on momma
Would you like a drink on me? (drinks on me)
To me it's no problem if you wanna (baby come and drink with me)
She take it off at the do', she take it off for the do'
Get that ass on the flo', go, go
To me, there's no problem if you wanna, baby come drink with me
You can have the time of your life, it's alright
Make it a night to remember (remember), how couldn't you remember? (remember)
You can have the time of your life, it's alright
Make it a night to remember (remember), how couldn't you remember? (remember)

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Yes, yes
Think about it
Who brought the gangsta shit to the party
Aftermath, better than ever
