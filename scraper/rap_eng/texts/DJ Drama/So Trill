[Hook]x2
Young nigga so trill
I keep it so real
Young nigga gettin chose
Slammin' Cadillac doors

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
The underground king in my city, I'm the don of my town
Niggas hidin', bitches wanna come in the ride
Had to skip slab and I went straight to foreign
You niggas ridin' in a rental like your moving a pound
Young H-town 'til I D-I-E
I'm with the trill OG, I got my trill ID
Windows down, ???
On my face if a nigga wanna see by me
I tell a bitch take her time, she can't wait
And I don't shit on time, she ain't late
Strapped up when she ride and I ride
So slow, pulled up to the club a day late
I never said shit to talk down on niggas
I never did shit straight clown on niggas
I never did this, I ain't never did that
Fuck that, man I'm 'bout to come down on niggas

[Hook]x2

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
K-R-I-T, trill nigga
The reason your bitch won't deal wit'cha
In a Cadillac the fours on vogues done swang
The fifth wheel poke, the trunk on glow and bang
And a cup of drank to up my rank for real
And a down ass bop that wanna fuck my wheel
Third Coast bitch, what you know about this?
I put the fear of God in 'em when I tighten my fist
Like my wrist, deuce on a hater
P-I-M-P, what's a suit without gators?
Candy no flavors, horse with no stable
Lost on the range 'til I put her on the table
Diamonds and wood, lookin' good like a young playa should
With this kinda limp I oughta have a cane
UGK for life, I'm a student of the game
Multi and that'll never change
A nigga so trill
