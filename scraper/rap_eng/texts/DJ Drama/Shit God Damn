[Verse 2: Big Sean]

Ooh it's about to get drastic, ass is like the number one draft pick
I does this shit historically, no wonder why they recorded me, I'm important as these imported drinks that they pour for me
Your wifey is a whore to me, I break her, break her off then send her back like she got a warranty
Bust it open girl, let me see something, her and her friend ask what time it is, 3-some'n duh
It's just me and C Breezy, life's a bitch cause the hoes too easy
I blow a oh oh oh oh smoking loudly boy, just blew 4 O's I'm outty boy, I got this shit so cloudy boy
All these hoes up in my truck, that shit look like a lobby boy, but you don't, you don't, you don't know nothing 'bout that boy

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Big Sean]
Got 'em like (Shit, god damn)
In the club, jumping, let the party begin
