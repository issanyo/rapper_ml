[Chorus: T.I.]
You know I represent the A Town and I ain't gon' stop
And we forever stay down that why we on top
Catch me on Bankhead sittin' on fo's
I don't give a damn how many records I sold
I'ma represent the A Town
Let me welcome you to the A Town
Bankhead Westside nigga A Town
Adamville, Alley Temple
Nigga A Town, aye and I said

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I jumped off the post Center Hill I was seven then
Moved to College Park at eleven started sellin' wit
It started sinkin' in, they really gave my uncle ten
Now what I'm 'posed to do? Get a crew and start hustlin'
Now we trappin' up on Campbellton, ask 'em, they remember me
We used to move that work from Oak City way to Kimberly
Took the hustle out that Riverdale, made a killin' G
Brought it back to Bankhead, where I'm gon' see it till it's history

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
On the Westside trillin' up, Zone 3 fillin' up
Herndon Homes, Bowen Homes, Harvel Homes, fillin' up
Ain't nobody trill as us, Bankhead really fucked
That's why my Dayton rims make yo' rims look like titty fuck
Listen up, only nigga in the South they talkin' 'bout
Put your bitch out on the expressway make her walk it out
A Town showin' up, Fulton County veteran
Spread all the way too Tennessee

[Chorus: T.I.]
You know I represent the A Town and I ain't gon' stop
And we forever stay down that why we on top
Catch me on Bankhead sittin' on fo's
I don't give a damn how many records I sold
I'ma represent the A Town
Let me welcome you to the A Town
Bankhead Westside nigga A Town
Adamville, Alley Temple
Nigga A Town, aye and I said

[Verse 3: Sean P]
Straight from Decatur, an Eastside mayne
From Glenwood to County Road niggas gettin' paid
From Weslyn Chapel back to Covington Highway
I still pull up just like in my driveway
Ya can't do a song about the A without me
See I was gettin' money while they was in car seats
See I was in the street, shawty totin' that heat
Throw the E's in they face and let 'em know I'm 'bout heat

[Chorus: T.I.]
You know I represent the A Town and I ain't gon' stop
And we forever stay down that why we on top
Catch me on Bankhead sittin' on fo's
I don't give a damn how many records I sold
I'ma represent the A Town
Let me welcome you to the A Town
Bankhead Westside nigga A Town
Adamville, Alley Temple
Nigga A Town, aye and I said

[Verse 4: Lonnie Mac]
I'm a '82 grady baby, young twenty six
ATL, Dirty South, I played in the grit
This was 'round the time when niggas first saw bricks
Back when Ronald Reagan was the president and shit
Drama had a house right off of Hollywood Road
(Westside)
They was robbin' and tastin' Hollywood coke
Mama say we movin'
When she get a lil' mo' paper she enrolled me into school
But it will weigh out in Decatur
This was 'round the time when Elay Meadows was the ghetto
And I was sleepin' with the rats and roach gloss on my pillow
When niggas rolled hammers down Calabenki
Put that Ghetto Mafia back in I'ma fizz off
Back when niggas didn't know shit about a cigarillo
I was gettin' my grind on flat shows at the
(Unverified)
To get the TV that's challengin'
Then you wide skirt niggas ain't real as me

[Chorus: T.I.]
You know I represent the A Town and I ain't gon' stop
And we forever stay down that why we on top
Catch me on Bankhead sittin' on fo's
I don't give a damn how many records I sold
I'ma represent the A Town
Let me welcome you to the A Town
Bankhead Westside nigga A Town
Adamville, Alley Temple
Nigga A Town, aye and I said
