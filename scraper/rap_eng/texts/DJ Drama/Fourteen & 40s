[Intro]
Father God, forgive me. As I sit in the back of this 4 door vehicle, I know the crimes I'm about to commit. Potentially put me in jail for a decade and a half. I ask you look down upon me with mercy and judge me not by the crimes I commit, but by the character of my heart. Feel the conflicts in my soul. As of this moment, I pray that you guard with with protection. If it's gon' be my day to leave this earth by your will, I sincerely repent and accept you as my saviour

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's the nigga ridin' clean on the corner
I done did my thing since a nigga 14
Yeah, it's the nigga ridin' clean on the corner
I done did my thing since a nigga 14
Yeah, it's the nigga ridin' clean on the corner
I done did my thing since a nigga 14
Yeah, it's the nigga ridin' clean on the corner
I done did my thing since a nigga 14

[Verse 1]
I'm out there puffin' smoke, my life no fuckin' joke
I'm fuckin' broke and gots to get up and get this fuckin' dough
These niggas hatin' so my life is demonstrated by my pen and paper
One way to address it straight up, now check
Mama, I'ma promise to make you proud as ever
But for now I got to get from round the shots they tryna set up
My niggas ride like it ain't no fuckin' north
Puttin' all my niggas all runnin' down the fuckin' north
Frontin' okay I, kept it smoother than ladies legs in the expressive culture
We criminal dudes, they watchin' fools subliminal moves
We be, them niggas still bap bap
Them niggas kill, 10 niggas killed for tryna keep it trill

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's the nigga ridin' clean on the corner
I done did my thing since a nigga 14
Yeah, it's the nigga ridin' clean on the corner
I done did my thing since a nigga 14
Yeah, it's the nigga ridin' clean on the corner
I done did my thing since a nigga 14
Yeah, it's the nigga ridin' clean on the corner
I done did my thing since a nigga 14

[Verse 2]
Now as I look around
I see some niggas used to be my niggas, crooked now
Claimin' they gon' be schemin' when they see me lookin' out
It's fucked up but I gots keep this heat up cookin' now
Can somebody tell me what's the reason for these trick answers?
When my chick answers talkin' 'bout she left my crib advances
Threw me a set up for coochie, that coochie get you wetter
Just focused on me, lottin' these on and niggas ain't gettin' they bread up
My flow consistent, niggas, hoes and pistols
They send my hoes with crystal
I ain't no trick, just makin' a grip and know that my dough's official
So please, let me breath and let me get to this guap
You fuck around, I'll leave you dead on the dot
That's on the dot, nigga

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's the nigga ridin' clean on the corner
I done did my thing since a nigga 14
Yeah, it's the nigga ridin' clean on the corner
I done did my thing since a nigga 14
Yeah, it's the nigga ridin' clean on the corner
I done did my thing since a nigga 14
Yeah, it's the nigga ridin' clean on the corner
I done did my thing since a nigga 14
