[Hook: Fee Banks (Lil Wayne)]
That's why your bitch want a real nigga like me
That's why your bitch want a real nigga like me
She want to give that pussy to a nigga like me
She want to give that pussy to a nigga like me
I be pimpin them hoes, I be pimpin them hoes
I be pimpin them hoes, pimp-pimpin them hoes
(I be workin them bitches, I be workin them bitches
I be workin them bitches work workin them bitches)

[Verse 1: Wayne]
Weezy F. Baby, the mothafuckin Carter
Bitches on my stick but my name ain't Harry Potter
They think I'm very hotter, your girl say the same
And since we like to travel, she let us run a train
And my defense put me in the Hall of Fame
I make her turn over every time we play the game
Your boy Wayne, ask them niggas how I came
In a Ferrari, Jaguar switchin both lanes
Living room in the kitchen on a plane
I get from A to B so comfortably, I
Do my thing, y'all niggas so plain
I'm so fly, call me Soul Plane

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wayne]
To him, I'm a killer, to her, I'm a lover
I always wear a mask, and I always wear a rubber
Yeah, I'm from the hood, but my crib in the suburbs
They love a nigga VIBE, so thats why I got the cover
My nigga Mack Maine is like a brother from another
We from the same hood, we will kill a motherfucker
We eat you niggas lunch, and to bitches I'm supper
She ask me to go down, I'm like, "As long as I fuck her"
I wear I lot of diamonds, see baby I'm a stunna
So ride a nigga dick, for a baby-bear Hummer
And homie, you can have her, cause I don't really want her
You put the dick in her, I put the dick on her

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm hotter than fire, she wetter than a bitch
These niggas really pussy, and I'm harder than my dick
I show too much love for you to be a hater
I ain't home every day, but I'm gettin' my paper
I know what's going on cause I'm the creator
And since I'm so early, I holla at 'em later
I sound like sex comin' through the fader
Bitch, I'm the president, not the mayor

[Hook]

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
That was a Fee and Weezy Baby collabo
