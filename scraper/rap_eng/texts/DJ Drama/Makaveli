[Intro: DJ Drama & Tory Lanez]
Gangsta Grillz, yeah
Years in the making, New Toronto)
And when I go, they gon' remember me like motherfuckin' Makaveli
You know I've been there in the winter time
These niggas's started
I would finish I came back and finished like I am Makaveli
It's quite cold outside, let's warm this bitch up
Bandana round my head like I’m Makaveli
Ya ready?

[Hook]
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi
Then it's the Wraith again, we'll be rich forever
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi
Then it's the Wraith again, I told them that we could be rich together
And when I go they gon' remember me like motherfuckin' Makaveli
These niggas thought that I was finished
I came back like I am Makaveli
Bandana round my head like I’m Makaveli
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi
Then it's the Wraith again, we'll be rich forever
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi
Then it's the Wraith again, I told them that we could be rich together
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi
Then it's the Wraith again
Nigga's left me out for dead, now I'm Makaveli
Reincarnated Makaveli

[Verse 1]
Real money, call the lawyer for the deal money
Way a nigga laughin' to the bank, you would think the checks are lookin' real funny
Know a couple niggas that would kill for me, couple bitches that would steal for me
Nigga's still love me, women still love me 'cause they only get it true and real from me
I'm a full time jaw dropper, pardon nigga, but I give it to 'em
All this Activis up in the Sprite, this shit was gettin' to it, I was sippin' through it
I was with the ruger, nigga really shootin', puttin' bitches all up in the Bentley coupe
It's Birkin to the, to the, to the, titty too, I rode Aventador like it's a rented coupe
Boy, we the other side when them other guys talkin' down
Talkin' 'bout how we run shit, talkin' 'bout how we shut it down
Came in the with the whole thing of the old thing, roll chain with the SoulTrain
With the white girl, baby, cocaine and you know the name and you know the name
Lord, on God, boy, right now, parked outside, straight black Masi
On God, boy, right now, I own heat, no Pat Riley
Made a million dollars rap tourin', I ain't talkin' no Kyle Lowry
Young nigga like the ten commandments, always got ten thous on me

[Hook]
I'm Makaveli
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi
Then it's the Wraith again, we'll be rich forever
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi
Then it's the Wraith again, I told them that we could be rich together
I pull out the Porsche, I jump in the Mazi
Then it's the Wraith again
Nigga's left me out for dead, now I'm Makaveli
Reincarnated Makaveli
