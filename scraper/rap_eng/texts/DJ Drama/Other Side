[Intro]
I think y'all niggas know how the fuck we get down
I hop out on Ocean, UNO hop out with 27 bitches behind me, odd numbers
Uno momento, mami
Let me get back to this paper, gimme one second

[Chorus]
Fuck the other side, fuck the other side
You gon' make us do it, make us come alive
Fuck the other side, fuck the other side
You gon' make us do it, we gon' come alive
When we come alive
When we come alive
Put it on the news
Bitch, we comin' live

[Verse 1]
Money is all on the table
My stallion bitches is a stable
Italian scallops and shrimp
What I mean is, shit on you haters
Don't forget that they came for the cable
Don't forget that they did me no favors
Don't forget that I came from the bottom
With niggas who rockin', put 6 in the chamber
Don't forget that I came from the bottom
Don't forget when they did me no favors
Won't forget how I came in the club on the sofa
Put Margiela kicks on the table
Hoppin', hoppin' out with my maneuvers
I been juggin', cookin', I been movin'
Balenciaga Papi got the shooters
And they probably hoppin' out the Uber
Bitch, I got that Waka Flocka Flame
Pussy niggas tryna steal the lane
Pussy niggas tryna kill my flame
Pussy nigga 'bout to feel this frame

[Chorus]
Fuck the other side, fuck the other side
You gon' make us do it, make us come alive
Fuck the other side, fuck the other side
You gon' make us do it, we gon' come alive
When we come alive
When we come alive
Put it on the news
Bitch, we comin' live

[Verse 2]
Yeah, well let's put the stitch on the picture
They rather diss me on Insta
I rather call them direct
And then put the dick in they sister
I'ma get riches on riches
My bitches got bitches on bitches
But I need revenge on them niggas
And bitches that told us we wasn't gon' get it
When they locked, my nigga in the trenches
Had the .40 Glock and an extension
If I did it, nigga. I'd be finished
If did it, nigga, I'd be finished
They all frontin' on my nigga
Kellz still got the pictures
Hell yeah, I kept it realer
Hell yeah I kept it triller
Shawty had me in the trenches
Always down to get the skriller
Now we linkin' up in Paris
Ain't nobody realer, believe it

[Chorus]
Fuck the other side, fuck the other side
You gon' make us do it, make us come alive
Fuck the other side, fuck the other side
You gon' make us do it, we gon' come alive
When we come alive
When we come alive
Put it on the news
Bitch, we comin' live

[Verse 3]
Certain mans, they are not my niggas
Certain mans, got no guap, I figure
You will not see me with certain mans
Bitch, I'm down to catch a murder, fam
I'm from the dot, bitch, dunkno
I'm out in Brampton with that, dunkno
No we don't mix, don't mix with certain mans
Story up, bro
All on the corner with niggas, who sellin' the dodi
They gettin' impatient, the streets is tellin' me they want it
We had enough of the fuckery, time to get up on it
Grip up on it, let them niggas know to get up on it time to get this shit poppin'
Illest nigga since big poppa
I hit up and put the truck up in the front
And let them niggas know I got the whip driver
Hoppin' out the new Mercedes, nigga
Louboutin my ladies, nigga
Niggas try to copy, but they can't do it
Try to duplicate it, nigga
Puttin' lubes on a nigga team
22s on a nigga Benz
Niggas move like them niggas cool
But my nigga you ain't a nigga friend
Been trappin' for too long
My team is just to strong
My niggas is in it
It's One Umbrella 'til the finish, we too good

[Chorus]
Fuck the other side, fuck the other side
You gon' make us do it, make us come alive
Fuck the other side, fuck the other side
You gon' make us do it, we gon' come alive
When we come alive
When we come alive
Put it on the news
Bitch, we comin' live
