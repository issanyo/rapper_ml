[Intro: DJ Drama]
You know I've been working so hard, I got skinny again
That means I'm still hungry
Dead Prez
Barack O Drama

[Hook]
I know way too many people here right now listening to this mixtape like who the fuck are yall
I sware it feels like the last few years in the mainstream everyone forgot about reppin the cause
What are we doin what are we doin oh yeah what about let's get free taking care of family this is the song of my life man
Cause all I know to be is a soldier for my culture and it's far from over

[Verse 1: M-1]
2X: RBG RBG Dead Prez like Lantern never fall off what the hell was yall thinking

We 10 years deep still real still eatin still middle finger to the police and still mean it
This is RBG code this is more than just a pop song if you don't know must not of been out on the block long
Let me show you how to speak the language in better form I sware this life is like the realist movement ever born
Truth is like a 44 magnum in this business I'm out to go Jonathen Jackson on you bitches
Little homie you know you could catch cancer from them swishers don't get lost in that liquor till it eats up your liver
Gotta spit it how I live it I am my brothers keeper rappers integrity today is cheaper than some reefer
The whole game is blunted everybody want to be a stunner, but where's the honor when the white man run it

[Hook]

[Verse 1: stic.man]
2X: Yo one thing about music when it hits you feel no pain ten years later ain't shit changed, but the players in the game
Still ahead of the pack as Drake studied my rap matter of fact I give to that, but at least he ain't sellin no crack so I take my flow right back
Stop the beef it doesn't matter how many records they sellin cause all this bullshit they yellin gonna start a hiphop rebellion
In the real world don't have no bounaries and fears this word sound power that we put in their ears can change the world
It's bigger than diamonds in your necklace we out here doin dope toatin pistols actin reckless in the real world you can't just act like you don't care
Cause what you gonna have when the fame and fourtune disappear if you a rapper trapper actor finger snapper copy cater or a money gettin cracka just say it
But then if you fake snake cake claimin that you pushin weight when you ain't do I really have to say it

[Hook]
