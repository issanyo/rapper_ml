Last name Teacha, first name Biggie:
Notoriously allusive if you wanna get picky
Forever on my game, so sorry: I'm persnickety
Trickery, Hitch-ery, Fresh Prince, get jiggity
Fresh beats, no diggity, white street, I rap rippity
Ear-joy: Melo's voice, Knicks be back in the city
A little nicky cause my sixteen's aflame:
Double nickel at the Garden cause I’m back in the game
Rap Jordan firing vinyl bullets from my 45
Brutish beast, stabbing 23 times
38 special: lin-sanely lyrical crimes
Bet beans Bryant know now that I more than drop dimes
I use 10 cent words (y’all just mimes) --
Loquacious, syntactical, polyvalent rhymes;
Meet a malevolent mercenary, man, I'm marching the ides:
And I’m cutting yall’s bars, so call me Ginsu knives!
