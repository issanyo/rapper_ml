[Chorus]
At the top it's just us nigga
But I don't really trust niggas
OTF it's just us nigga
But I don't really trust niggas
GBE we don't fuck with niggas
At the top where you see us nigga
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggas
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggas

[Verse 1]
From a bitch I want top nigga
Fuck a opp we send shots nigga
Bullets coming non-stop nigga
At the top I don't see you niggas
And I'm steady rolling up swishers
If it's a problem we ain't get the issue

Since a youngin been a real nigga
Smoke I blow nothing but kill nigga
And bitch I'm in the field, nigga
You might get killed, nigga

GBE we don't fuck with niggas
At the top where you see us nigga
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggas
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggas

[Verse 2]
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggas
A small circle with no new niggas
Because I dont really trust niggas
GBE it's just us nigga
And she just wanna fuck with us
So much kush keep me stuck nigga
In other words high as fuck nigga

Right or wrong you'll get left nigga
For that bag you'll get left nigga
For my niggas you'll get left nigga

[Chorus]
At the top it's just us nigga
But I don't really trust niggas
OTF it's just us nigga
But I don't really trust niggas
GBE we don't fuck with niggas
At the top where you see us nigga
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggas
Since a youngin bitch we been them niggas
