[Verse: Don Q]
Makin' my way in the paint
I'm breakin' the bank
I drink till I can't roll me an eigthth of that
Look I got an Uber that will bring the product to you
I count a lot of mula hallejulah, hallejulah
You want him dead I'll bring his head and his body to you
Make his momma a body viewer send some flowers to her
I played the block with them llama shooters powder movers
Dark liquor, hard sipper heavy, marajuana user
The streets sayin' I'm the next one up
You a sheep in disguise they just dressed one up
Nigga all we know is ball till them cheques run up
Yours decline I swipe mine then an X come up
Ah, I come from pitchin' vials now they love a nigga sound
I don't need a stylist, I got a list of styles
Everythin' expensive now, I can hit a different town with the System in the rental loud tinted window down
Got a diploma but never filled out a college form
I probably would have made a trap out the college dorm
The students I got it for 'em it ain't hard to miss me
Sweater by Givenchy, Moncler or the Kenzi
I seen a nigga in the cold no jacket on
Just a ratchet and a dumb nigga that will pack it for him
Can't find they vic man they ain't askin' for 'em
They gon' slide up send a message and let you have it for 'em
In the club we bottle sip you in the club you swallow spit
With the same niggas ima spend it who i got it with
Bitches see that presidential now they wanna politick
And all the bad bitches real niggas gon' acknowledge it I swear
Gon' ack -
And all the bad bitches real niggas gon' acknowledge it I swear

Bridge boys, nigga
Gang

I just found a plug for that actavis
I just found a plug for that actavis
They think this money came by accident
How they thinkin' all this money came by accident
I bought a hooptie just to trap in it
I ride around with that pack in it
I ride around with them racks in it
Pull up on your block do a shoot out then we jump back in it Nigga! I found a plug for that actavis
I just found a plug for that actavis
They think this money came by accident
Now how they thinkin' all this money came by accident
I bought a hooptie just to trap in
I ride around with that pack in it
I still ride around with them racks in it
Pull up on your block do a shoot out then we jump back in it
