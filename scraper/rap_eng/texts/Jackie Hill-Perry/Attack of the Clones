[Verse 1: JGivens]
Mic check, check the decorum
Everything that glitters might not be considered to be Aurum
To be or, um, to be gold
So, so far from home, don’t let me get in my zone
Remove the curse of these clones
Run with no feet, they speak but they won’t preach
Look but they don’t see, drum to their own beat

[Bridge: John Givez]
But there’s a cadence in his heart
A sum of all the time
Doesn’t coincide with the metronome in mind
Then another king has paved a way for me to move
I gotta pursue him

[Pre-Hook: JGivens & John Givez]
They say that there’s a grace abounding love that’s chasing me
Chasing me, chasing
Electrify, refined in the lightning of ten thousand power lines
But I need more than a sign

[Hook: JGivens]
I’m a man with a plan, with my life in His hands tryna find my way
I’ve been runnin' all day, runnin' all day on the wrong way
Attack of the clones, attack of the clones
Up, down, up, down, up, down
Then I crash in the ground
Gotta fly by faith

[Bridge: John Givez]
Feel the attack
And I know you saw me, no looking back
But I gotta know which way to go
I can’t see the fight all the time
But you know it’s on
(Attack of the clones, hold up)

[Verse 2: JGivens]
Countdown, thirty, twenty-five
Twenty fifteen going fast (if you think about it)
What you gon’ do, which road?
Which path gonna last? (better think about it)
(Attack of the clones)
Imitators are the ones that war with the Lord, Lord
(Attack of the clones)
And the violent take it by force (God, think about it)

[Pre-Hook: John Givez]
They say that there’s a grace abounding knowledge chasing me
They say
Electrify refined in the lightning of ten thousand power lines
But I need more than a sign

[Hook: JGivens]
I’m a man with a plan, with my life in His hands tryna find my way
I’ve been runnin' all day, runnin' all day on the wrong way
Attack of the clones, attack of the clones
Up, down, up, down, up, down
Then I crash in the ground
Gotta fly by faith

[Verse 3: Jackie Hill Perry]
What does it mean to, what
What, what does it mean to see you
When I see [?] be cool
When I see through
Need school, just to read you
Me, fool
Read, then you eat to feed fools with utensils full of pencils
So they quench, who me?
Who, what, me?
Look see, I don’t look keen
My goal, D-Day with the Normandy
Normally I’m a matrix
And I make ‘em when I take ships
And replace ‘em with a fake faith
I don’t wanna say grace
I don’t wanna, I don’t wanna run away with the way
Or wave hate to the place that faith makes in me
Trade place with the way of another me
That came when the grave couldn’t smuggle me
Make me, make me, make me new
Make me, make me, make me know
Look an old man, antique for sure
Clones that’s prone to forsake the truth
They imitate snakes, reptilian wolves
Skeptics too cold for the blood of a bull
To Nicholas Cage’s face full of good
Change his face for the good
Get it?

[Outro: JGivens]
Attack of the clones
Attack of the clones
