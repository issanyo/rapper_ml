[Intro: Natalie Lauren]

[Verse 1: Jackie Hill-Perry]
I don't know if you fell or if you was ever standing
But from my vantage it's like a picture that's candid
Caught off guard by the bandit who's stealing Christians I ran with
This race ain't for the swift yet it's tailored for the abandoned
This pain has made me ramble
It's like you gamble with life, roll seven then dismantle the dice
Bet on heaven while you dance with the price
I read the Scriptures with you, you even handled it right
Saw the Christ in every text, said exegetical sight
You knew the devil was a liar, what happened to you?
I seen him on your snapchat, you act like you happy, is you?
Sure you don't remember 'bout the fire, I'm glad to get you back
All them sermons that you preached about Adam in you
I guess them genetics sent you the wrong message
The wrong medic, you sick and the fix ingrown heaven
You stole leaven and mixed it with bricks and stone
As addicting it gets harder to love truth
I get it, I love you and this what love do

[Chorus: Natalie Lauren]
Both feet off the ground now
You far away, you falling
Lights faded out
It's dark but never too far from him
Come back to your first love
Come back to your first love
Come back to your first love

[Verse 2: Jackie Hill-Perry]
I don't know if you fell or if you was ever standing
But from my vantage I know you ain't plan it
This world ain't never random, it's mad strategic
You stopped eating what you really needed
Was glad to leave it, was mad at me when I kept it honest
Said your conscience was precious
Let you let the vomit etch and sketch away what you knew would profit
You left the promise, I promise it's true
I know that blindness seems like knowledge to you
Intelligence with hell in it, inhaling powers you knew
Rebellion better that's a lie from the bottom
Better yet the devil never tells a lie that he ain't swallow
How come you wallowed his name?
You switched in places with the god who was caine
And bottled the shame that you carried
Buried body, he raised you
Gotta be crazy cause you don't believe him
You don't believe him, you don't believe him
This life you leading, it's Christ you leaving
Despite the grief in your heart of stone
He can roll it back, I remember when you told me that
You told me that

[Chorus: Natalie Lauren]
Both feet off the ground now
You far away, you falling
Lights faded out
It's dark but never too far from him
Come back to your first love
Come back to your first love
Come back to your first love
