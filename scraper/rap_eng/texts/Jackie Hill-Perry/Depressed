[Hook: Beleaf]
I do it cause I'm depressed
I'm depressed cause I do it
I do it cause I'm depressed
I'm depressed cause I do it
I do it cause I'm depressed
I'm depressed cause I do it
My God'll help me get through it

[Bridge: Beleaf]
See what had happened was

[Verse 1: Beleaf]
Yeah, it was me and my guys
Running through the streets
And we trying to collide
With some bad girls, like Mary Jane
See, Mary Jane, she was very strange
She had orange hair and she stink
But I kept her around because she help me think
She help me think, she help me think about
I forgot
She help me sink into a low
Then she started taking all of my dough
And I never been high before
All I knew is that I wanted it some mo'
I'm just happy that I wasn't addicted
I wasn't addicted
I wasn't a-, I was addicted
How did I miss this? How do I fix this?

[Hook: Mr. J. Medeiros]
I do it cause I'm depressed
I'm depressed cause I do it
I do it cause I'm depressed
I'm depressed cause I do it
I do it cause I'm depressed
I'm depressed cause I do it
My God will help me get through it

[Bridge: Mr. J. Medeiros]
See what happened was

[Verse 2: Mr. J. Medeiros]
This rapper buzzed
Done mocked me, with his cocky laughter
Trust some Rocky wanna scrap with a Drago punch
Imma sock him til his knees hurt
And his teeth squirt on his T-shirt
What he had for lunch I need work
Let me add this up
Now he bragged a bunch
So I bragged a bunch
Mad at him cause I had what he hadn't once
Spat at him and backstabbed him
But in fact, it was sad when
He was acting like I had way
Back when, mad men being mad at men
No friends, just advertising and posting up
And billin' boards, ain't growing up
Just killin' boys
I throw this one up, through the ceiling and walls
Cause I trust you know what I'm feelin' Lord

[Hook: Jackie Hill Perry]
I do it cause I'm depressed
I'm depressed cause I do it
I do it cause I'm depressed
I'm depressed cause I do it
I do it cause I'm depressed
I'm depressed cause I do it
My God'll help me get through it

[Bridge: Jackie Hill Perry]
See what had happened is

[Verse 3: Jackie Hill Perry]
He put me in his mattress
Wanted me to be an actress
Wanted me to mask it
Wanted me to be a bad (Ahh!)
To mask was attractive
To the masses
Not the master who would fashion me
Who's as messed, matter fact could it be
Not me, other people is peepin' the deceased pieces of me, never see
I was addicted to attention
I was afflicted with this image
I was a tent that wanted men just
When ain't get it I was offended
When I ain't get it I wanna end it
So the intervention
Was a blade to the wrist
To the veins of a vain dame I wasn't livin'
Now I'm in this prison
Dang I was straight trippin'
Insane for the brains of a slave's vision

[Hook: JGivens]
I do it cause I'm depressed
I'm depressed cause I do it
I do it cause I'm depressed
I'm depressed cause I do it
I do it cause I'm depressed
I'm depressed cause I do it
My God will help me get through it

[Bridge: JGivens]
See what had happened was

[Verse 4: JGivens]
A! We was supposed to B together
Let us C and get the D together
Drop the E together
Skip class and a couple letters
Come back and get high J
It's you and me forever
Depression is the peer pressure
From your own reflection
Are you in the mirror
The mirror will get clearer
Minus these lines of snow
I know it's coke and it all reflects me
I'm supposed to be the salt exchange the Pepsi
Take you to B
Let's see where it gets me
I only did it twice and it's only cause the homie like
First time you ain't do it right
Thirty-third try
Heavily
Meth amphetamine
Blowin' O's
My nose is on fire
The high ain't really last
And I crashed quick, fast
Like the drive thru food
That goes with those fries
Now I'm smokin' on this glass
My clothes is goin' high

[Hook: Marty]
I do it cause I'm depressed
I'm depressed cause I do it
I do it cause I'm depressed
I'm depressed cause I do it
I do it cause I'm depressed
I'm depressed cause I do it
My God will help me get through it

[Verse 5: Marty]
Uh, yeah, lie to me
Make it sound good, baby, lie to me
No confidence in the God in me
I beat myself up for all the things
Ask how I'm doing
Well it all depends
Count the days from when I last sinned
It's been a while so I think I'm good
Yeah (I think I'm good)
I don't got a reason to lie to you
Like yeah I'm great
Okay that's the way
I know I'm lying why I'm such a fake
But I lie just to keep everyone away
And all the stupid things that they say
To try to fix me up like they know the way
I keep a smile still on my face
Please go away, no, don't go away dog

[Hook 2: Beleaf]
I do it because I'm depressed
Then I'm depressed cause I don't know
How not to do it
I do it because I'm depressed
Then I'm depressed cause I don't know how not to do it
I do it because I'm depressed
And I'm depressed cause I do it
My God'll help me get through it

[Bridge: Beleaf]
See what had happened was

[Verse 6: Beleaf]
Them internet girls had me in a net
The wide world is a web
Spun to capture us in sex
I know I'm buggin' out with the intellect
But my mind was infested with images
I have invested and became so diminishing
I try to terminate the termites
Til the tug of war turned my thoughts into a terabyte
Tossin' and turnin' in the middle of my night... mares
Bed bugs bite
A word addicted to the feelin they were concealing and it's quite clear
Keepin these secrets will get me anywhere
How do you exterminate the things that you think that you like
I think that I thought I wasn't right
Until I wrote it down and said it through the mic
Confessed to the fam and then prayed to the Christ

[Outro: Beleaf] (x2)
Now, I ain't depressed no mo'
Done with the stress fo' sho'
