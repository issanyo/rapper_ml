[Verse 1]
Uh, I know you see her
When she walks by, you looking cross-eyed
You want to meet her
But you can't comprehend what you're seeing
Beauty deeper than skin deep
You captivate her like a Great White
[Sharks]
Cause you probably thinking that she don't know how gorgeous she really is
So you be like
"I'm gonna be the one to show enough, Bruce Leroy
She gotta be the baddest that I done ever seen
I ain't looking for a wife so I ain't gonna get a ring"
You realize she's different
Respected and [longed for]
Of anything less than what seems [excellent]
No other stands out cause right about now you are witnessing

[Hook]
Queens
Royalty stands for for you are witnessing man
[?] and loving the least with your hands
Securing herself and her worth
And rejecting the lie
[?]
Advancing the kingdom
[?]
You're policies she will withstand
Queens (you were born to be)
Despite what you're hearing in all the of media
Queens [?]
Come and eat it up
Round of applause for repping so well for the team
Remember one thing
When they ask why we do it say, say
We had to do it one time for the queens

[Bridge 1]
Where my queens at?
Where my queens at?
Where my queens at?
(Had to do it one time for the queens)
Where my queens at?
Where my queens at?
Where my queens at?
(Had to do it one time for the queens) (2x)

[Verse 2: Jackie Hill-Perry]
After Adam came Eve out of bone
Didn't fashion a queen for a throne
But a queen that would long for the worship that lurks
When the King is at home and were singing a song
And we'll bend knees, till we end, and we'll envy
When they end she, when the enemy is an enemy is an energy
Intimate interest in the enemy of my enemy, wait, wait
Do a [?]
Matter fact, [?]
When you speak division in your accent
Like a reaction to match with the [?]
Solo with the notes, and we grab hymns
Till it heals strong and it adds in
That love from above with the tat skins
Give it it to us when we ask him to fashion
Queen

[Bridge 1]
Where my queens at?
Where my queens at?
Where my queens at?
(Had to do it one time for the queens)
Where my queens at?
Where my queens at?
Where my queens at?
(Had to do it one time for the queens) (2x)

[Bridge 2: Natalie Lauren]
Oh, right about now
I feel like leaving this doubt
No High King, but I'm just
Queen of the night
[?]
You know the kind got a thing for me right?
So the least I could give is my life
Jackie said we been fashioned
So we [?] fabric
Bout to sell ourselves short
We need Captain
Cause without Him we just a bunch of loose ends on unraveling
So we trust that He knows no mattress
[?] collects our pieces
Takes our patterns but he makes new sequence
[?]

[Bridge 1]
Where my queens at?
Where my queens at?
Where my queens at?
(Had to do it one time for the queens)
Where my queens at?
Where my queens at?
Where my queens at?
(Had to do it one time for the queens) (2x)
