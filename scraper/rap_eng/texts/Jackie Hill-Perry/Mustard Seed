[Intro]
There's only up from here
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong

[Verse 1]
I just saw my therapist
She talked about feelings, she said that I'm scared of it
I made a habit of crashing and acting like terrorists
I'd rather die 'fore I cry in front of the eyes of various
Everest still ain't move, maybe the mountain is me
Ye of little faith, the grace of face it is peace
Halloween around the corner with trace I'm taking to preach
About the freedom I don't believe in I'm off the leash
As soon as I'm done there's hundreds of reasons to change
One is Jesus, he wonders why I would underestimate
The one to one and the sum
In the summer to investigate, it's sunny outside
It's time to abide
I got a daddy in the ground and one in the sky
R.I.P. to pain, it's famous to live in it
It's like it's painting a picture
Picture me free, who paid it pray for the sea
Who made it into the tree
I stood by and looked high
And look why it won't prove where's my faith
Will it move

[Interlude]
Extremity in rhythm, yeah that's what ya heard
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong

[Verse 2]
Maybe I could find it if I tried to stop
Looking in other places to cover traces of other cages
I'm way way weaker than I was the other day but nobody knew
I was above the wave Peter who drowning who
I'm counted too
Finally somebody told me I was a fool for being honest
They probably never knew how hard it was to move in bondage
They probably never seen the conscience when it went to college
And got more knowledge of some doctrine while remaining godless
I know more than I live most times
Women looking up to me, I swear I fear those eyes
I feel those lies, they louder than my voice sometimes
They clouding up my joy, I'm fine
This doubt in us ain't choice, I'm lying
Believe it or not, me tweeting for props
I'm done trying to prove I'm even with God
It's our aim at mirage came with the camouflage and God's tape
The hidden scars we all waiting for healing 'til it's real as this song
I wanna be grown, I wanna suffer long
I wanna be strong, I wanna be home
I wanna belong
Only wanna be right but some of it wrong
But some of us on to something when we run to the throne
I'm knowing some saints that bear fruit like it's honey they sown
They ain't got two faces like they coming with clones
There's only up from here baby
I know it's nothing, you flown
