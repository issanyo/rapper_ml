[Intro]
I hope you hear it

[Verse 1]
I didn't sleep good
It's hard to fight when you dreams realer than life
Z's kill em' with stripes
These feelings got me missing the past
Thought I'd learned my lesson, the test is skipping the class
The scriptures at last: do I drop out or study harder?
The blood of martyrs
Rocking me like I'm Shawn Carter, but I'm blue
What color is the struggle? Is it the Sky?
Covered in helicopters the only option's to fly
But instead I'm stuck in this room
Ducking the new
God ask when I'ma come entrust in the move
I'm mumblin'  "soon"
Grab the phone for something to do
Loving the truth?
Nah, the truth a puzzle when you
Can't put the bigger picture together
Ain't no filters in real life
When you feel like
You tempted to still like the dark
So I steal light from y'all, your victory is mine
The surreal life of course
And of course
I'm divorced from the sin I once belonged to
My position ain't different, the distance is the song too
The sentence I don't owe you
An explanation is basic
I'm a saint and a saint that is easily prone to
Have a few bad days with a few bad ways
You ask "Wait, the answer ain't in you or Ye?"
Two swords late
Tell me to use em quick
Switch the blade out
The same route the fool attempts
It's rudiments to fight
But I don't feel like it
I don't feel righteous
I know I'm whiter than snow
But I don't feel pious
I feel Pilate
Trading Saviors for Barrabas
Trading places with Seraphims
Satan made into terrorists

[Verse 2]
Yeah I lusted, yeah I'm disgusted
Yeah I'm disgusting, now I'm redundant
Yeah-Yeah I'm done with some of the bad habits
I'll kill em' after the feast
Attracted to meat, feeling so happy to be
Silly rabbits call me charismatic when I ask for the chance to feel him
I'm bad with a Jackson's thriller
I'm Anne when addicts spill
Who gon' wash me clean?
My rag's filthy as the darkest
Marxist, the Neitsche, The heartless
Eat with the carcass, teach me to harken the truth
Lead me I'm off an' aloof
3D the larger the view
Of you, is the marginal truth
The argument talking bout' with the bullet
Aim it right at the faith
If I face it fake it I pull it
Amazing grace or the tulip
Does he love me, does he love me not?
The pot calling the kettle black
While pulling the petals back
Removing the devil's tracks
I'm a witness limits ask for forgiveness
Tempted to end it, tempted to be the menace - I'm Dennis
Mimic the rooster crow
Medusa told me don't crack when the mirror shows
I'm so broken, this hocus pocus, abracadabra
This rabbit ain't 8 mile, I can't smile
While I can roll I can't skate 'round
I can't stay down
Them actors saying I can't stay sound
And pray face down - they lying to me
I'm flying rookie
My plane dives, the fire cookin'
Mariah looking, carry me God
These legs will bury me God
Verily verily I'm scared of me God
Terror defined, find a synonym to match me in the dictionary
Find my picture on the last sheet
I'm the last sheep, sleeping on Omega like the last Z
I need the shepherd, the staff, the valley
The shadow to pass me
The second Adam
The Alpha
And the pasture to grab me
I need help

[Outro: Latifah Alattas]
O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be!
Let thy grace, now, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to thee
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here's my heart, O take and seal it
Seal it for thy courts above
