[Intro: Esteban Shedd]
I'm a new man made
I’m a new man made
I'm a new man made by Messiah, Man of Crowns

[Hook: Esteban Shedd]
I don't want it, I don’t want it
I don't want it now
Your picture of a man don't make me wanna bow
I don't want it, I don't want it
I don't want it now
I'm a new man made by Messiah, Man of Crowns

[Verse 1: Esteban Shedd]
This, {his great?} opus
I took this oath, this
Oath is a {prison?} {boy?} nonconformance
Of no less than my Christ be honored
And Morpheus morphed through the red, my fetus
This new man made by the blood of Jesus
My 95 theses of peace, I'm fearless
The fate of these kings so awfully obvious
And all the dark horses, Rome’s enormous
Babylon’s gorging beyond their margins
The devil's accomplice, America’s fat
Sitting, watching Netflix
My babies are the arrows I fling, my fletchers
A course for the glorious
My gifts, his emporeum
Pouring it, pouring out
Cornerstone calling out my mouth when the dose get flowing
Yo, this world is corduroy
{Patterns in?} playboys
{Few men report to?} joy
Compared to the course of God
But Christ filmed stories in Rome, my little boy
Stretched out the colors of God for all the world
Color grade {dollar lost?}, swear to God
He {grazed?} so beautifully
He holds my eulogy
Who made me, anyway?
Gave breath to illustrate
My Lord, I'm a {pawn, just saying?}
You're God, {word is born?}, I'm a man made

[Hook: Esteban Shedd]
I don’t want it, I don't want it
I don't want it now
Your picture of a man don't make me wanna bow
I don't want it, I don't want it
I don't want it now
I'm a new man made by Messiah, Man of Crowns

I don't want it, I don't want it
I don't want it now
Your picture of a man don't make me wanna bow
I don't want it, I don't want it
I don't want it now
I'm a new man made by Messiah, Man of Crowns

[Verse 2: Esteban Shedd]
This overture, swear to God, is otherworldly
My soul said glory, this cross before me
Rose stone back for me, mined the quarry
This human story
Must be a supernatural God who caught me
Called and bought me
Kenosis, oceans bled, abandoned
To inside mine, birthed the Holy Phantom
Revealed that law, now grace abounding
Truth and spirit, now all-surrounding
A tribune tribe now in me lounging
Working through the cobwebs, flesh denouncing
With these abounding, take this heart, man
Each 10.5 ounces pounding
And {?} decrease to {?}
Humble for my helium
{Buy?} like Solomon
Way of these great men in history founding
Finding solace in
Throwing crowns down
To produce a parliament
Where celebrities abound
Eagles might drown
But all these haughty eyes gonna bow to his gown
Just saying, I believe a {bully?}

[Interlude: Esteban Shedd]
(Of a man made
God make a man made
God made man, I'm a made man
Manifesto of a made man
By your made man
Manifesto of a man made
God came as a man
Made by this made man
Manifesto
Made man)

[Hook: Esteban and Jackie Hill-Perry]
I don't want it, I don't want it
I don't want it now
Your picture of a woman don't make me wanna bow
I don't want it, I don't want it
I don't want it now
I'm a new woman made by Messiah, Man of Crowns

[Verse 3: Jackie Hill-Perry]
It's complicated
How I was told to be wrote with, folded
With different pages
How I was told to be open, focused
At different ages
On being basic, metaphor for enslavement
Matador dodging the bull
Quick, it's amazing
Too immature for the toolkit
It's an apron
The fix-it, he serve me now
I'm the one replacing the dishes
He earns the crown
I'm the one that's facing
The image of God
I'm made in it
He finished the  job
I ain't in this to any image
That's different than God
I ain't finished
The paint chipping
I'm dripping it, All
Pictures of women are all
Fit for submission
That's loss
Lemme find it, it ain't in the walls
Jericho of the culture will fall
And when it does
I'll be standing in awe
I'll be standing in awe
