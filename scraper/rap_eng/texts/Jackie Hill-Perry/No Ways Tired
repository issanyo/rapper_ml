[Verse 1: Jackie Hill-Perry]
She said she was tired
Tired of mailing her sons away
Tired of guns summoning death
Telling the press, too frustrated to yell and it's messing with her
I remember when they told me I wasn't the homie
I was a segment
She said it with tears with her head in my chest and
I felt the burden, I felt it burn up, I saw the fire
I saw the furnace, who turned it higher?
I heard and turned and grabbed some dirt
She said that my son's inside it
It's hard to pray and say the name of [?] but who will listen?
This prison system is lynching my babies
His bail is higher than what put him inside and it's crazy
Is he a colleague from Riker's Island with violence
Or maybe he gotta die to be safe
And I'm still alive, let us pray

[Hook: Jackie Hill-Perry]
Life is getting harder, God I need thee
Gotta walk on water where you are, oh God I need thee
God I'm losing focus, hold me close because I need thee
Never let me go, oh don't I know it, God I need thee

[Verse 2: Jackie Hill-Perry]
He said he was woke
He tired of sleeping, he tired of weeping for bodies
Nobody try believing the body is blind, I see it
He said it with red in his eye
The color that smothered his brother under that sheet
He mumbles something I seen
The other day when I was walking with him
Through the park with lots of children, dogs of all civilians
No guards to stop and frisk or draw revolvers, all the privilege
We all so different, walks beside a Christian
Can't decide the difference, I provide a bridge
He frowns and says he wants to hate 'em
Put a noose around his neck and text him "how's it hanging?"
Treat him like his skin's the curse of Ham, he knows it's Satan
When the press becomes oppressive, it's us trading places
So he bids him grace and praises

[Bridge: Joseph Solomon]
I can't get tired
I can't get tired

[Hook: Jackie Hill-Perry]
Life is getting harder, God I need thee
Gotta walk on water where you are, oh God I need thee
God I'm losing focus, hold me close because I need thee
Never let me go, oh don't I know it, God I need thee

She said she was tired
