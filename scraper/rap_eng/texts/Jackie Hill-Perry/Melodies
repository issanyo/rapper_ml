What can wash away my sins?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
And what can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

And oh precious is that flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

And when I think of the goodness of Jesus
And all he's done for me
My soul, my soul cries out Hallelujah
I thank God for saving me

For saving me, for saving me
I thank God for saving me
My soul, my soul cries out Hallelujah
I thank God for, for saving me
