[Verse 1]
Once upon a time we was a bone from the first body
To roam 'til it cursed
Quiet, now it's gone
Now we violent against the silent
Momma told me being a woman was hard and she wasn't lying
Your daughter argues with lions to bear fruit
I tear through tigers who try to tie us with snares too
Tight as we wear it like it's a sweater
I swear America lead us astray
Dogging us out like they messed with the gate
It's Esther with faith
Mordecai remind us of fate
Rewind to replay
The role we was made for
The game scores
You see it pointing forward the ancient of days, your
Bible ain't changed, your
Highness still reigns, pours
Showers as doubt is the object of cowards
I was astounded when I found that that I was of value
I object a power found in the body where idols let me be modest
Let me be honest, let me be woman
God forbid I ever tell God how it should be done

[Chorus: Sharon Irving]
Woman woman, you don't know
Where you came from, please go home
Tell us, tell us, who gave you your name
Tell us, tell us, who gave you your frame
It's God, it's God, it's God, it's God
It's God, it's God

[Verse 2]
Who they tell you to be?
A firecracker or fire starter?
You oughta know
Alanis taught us
Doesn't start with a Barbie with long hair in the party
It's tragic being in pageants
Being fake about yourself like you happy with being plastic
Did they tell you your body was just a hobby?
That being mommy was obviously a problem?
Why would you follow his eye on the sparrow?
Why would you fill your quiver?
God forbid that these arrows make your road more narrow
Make your life little harder
Eden my daughter
You taught us calling was part of falling in love with the Father
Abba, I'm done trying to barter with this culture
Yeah, I done trying to spar up with them vultures
Flying over what's dying
Tomorrow I'm a wife
Yesterday I was a mother
Today I'm just a woman
Next week I'm just a sister
Look I'm more than just a picture
What am I: I'm a woman that's made in God's image

[Chorus: Sharon Irving]
Woman woman, you don't know
Where you came from, please go home
Tell us, tell us, who gave you your name
Tell us, tell us, who gave you, your frame
It's God, it's God, it's God, it's God
It's God, it's God
