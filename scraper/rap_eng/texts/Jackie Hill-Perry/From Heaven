[Verse]
Victory is mine, victory is mine
Victory today is mine
I told Satan to get thee behind
Cause victory today is mine
For in the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus
We have the victory
In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus
Satan will have to flee
So tell me who can stand before us
When we call on that great name?
It's Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus
We have the victory
