[Verse 1]
So much to do, so little time
I'm too busy to see it, open the blinds
I'm too dizzy to balance, half of my spine
Let me back up, a sabbath is on my mind
Cause I'm stressed out, what is next now?
Will it help out or will it stretch doubt?
Is it the best route or did it just cloud?
The best rest happens when I let him have it
Cause I'm doing too much

[Hook]
I'm doing too much, I'm doing too much
(Doing too much, doing too much)
I'm doing too much, I'm doing too much
(Doing too much, doing too much, yeah yeah)
I'm doing too much, I'm doing too much
(Doing too much, doing too much)
I'm doing too much, I'm doing too much
(Too much, too much, too much, too much yeah)

[Verse 2]
Taking rest don't make sense
When the rent taking my cents
When ambition making my sense
Not making what it made when I laid bent
When my days was a slave to clock
Now I'm shocked that I can't swim
Can't weave when it's late and I can't miss
The next date on my plate
Heavy laden, will he take it and make it something?
Cause I noticed that I've been doing too much

[Hook]
I'm doing too much, I'm doing too much
(Doing too much, doing too much)
I'm doing too much, I'm doing too much
(Doing too much, doing too much, yeah yeah)
I'm doing too much, I'm doing too much
(Doing too much, doing too much)
I'm doing too much, I'm doing too much
(Too much, too much, too much, too much yeah)

[Outro]
I'm doing too much, I'm doing too much
So much to do, so little time
I'm doing too much
I'm too dizzy to balance, half of my spine
Stressed out, what is next now?
Will it-- stressed out, what is next now?
Will it-- best route or did it just cloud?
I'm doing too much, I'm doing too much
I'm doing too much, I'm doing too much
Heavy laden, will he take it and make it something?
Cause I noticed--
Cause I noticed that I've been doing too much
I've been doing too much
