Intro:
Ayo, yo, this is motherfucking Tyga Thug... It's National Rap Day
Know what I'm saying, word up, motherfuckers better know
Fucking bitch
Ayo

Verse :
It's national rap day, the caged animals that way
You ain't even halfway to have a pile of stacked hay
I make all these bitches vanish
I've been having to yell ever since I fell on this rocky planet
And if I see you walking with her
While you're crossing rivers, I'll break your glasses since I'm often bitter
I got three boys crying
I'm at full strength like the Detroit Lions
I'm giant, so stop lying or stay silence, I'm a bad guy
But I'm also good 'cause my rhymes are multi syllable, that's why
I'm ready to face all cats, hit 'em with a baseball bat
You'll be next to Gabe Paul's plaque, I may call back
So go and find a good spot, I'm doing what I should not
Went to da hood caught, cause I gave someone an injured shot
So go find the same broker, to handle these lame jokers
But don't get any closer like the Chainsmokers

Outro:
It's national rap day (Tyga, Tyga, Tyga Thug)
It's national rap day
It's national rap day (Tyga, Tyga, Tyga Thug)
My skills are outta the galaxy
It's national rap day (Tyga, Tyga, Tyga Thug)
It's national rap day (Tyga, Tyga, Tyga Thug)
