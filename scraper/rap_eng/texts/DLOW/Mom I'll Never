Hook:

"Mom i'll never smoke"
And "mom i'll never drink"
Okay, maybe just a bowl
Shots of vodka numb the pain
You caught me coming home
Got ciroc up in the veins
Marijuana in the clothes

Bridge:

Mom:  "why you home so late?"
"yeah, i was at a party
Thought i told you before i left"
Mom:  "well you didn't"
"sorry i really thought i had
We went swimming then to arby's"
Mom:  "then why your eyes so red?"
"yeah, must've been the chlorine...
Now ima go to bed"

Verse 1:

I remeber when i
Was only 7 and i
Was told the devil's inside
Of all the shit that i like
From rap music to crime
To tatoos on my arms
And fat booty, lil dimes
I made a promise to mom
That i would never do "this"
Or "that" but ain't that a bitch?
Cause i did half of that sht
Right after as just a kid
And i'ma add to the list
Right...right after this hit
Shit

Hook:

"Mom i'll never do this"
And "mom i'll never do that"
Now im smoking doobies
And i'ma get a few tats
Told me, "stay in  school"
But nope, i didn't do that
"im only human"
That's my only excuse ma'am
"Mom i'll never do this"
And "mom i'll never do that"
Now im smoking doobies
And i'ma get a few tats
Told me, "stay in  school"
But nope, i didn't do that
Now all i got is music
So i'ma go pursue that (x2)
Yeah

Verse 2:

A while back i tried applying
To my favorite college
I didn't get a ful ride
Like i originally promised
Yeah you thought i had the drive
But overtime, to be honest
I had came to realize
I never had that kind of mileage
I've been posted blowing smoke and
Fucking hoes to raise endorphins
Roping dough with no promotion
No we slowing making motions
Hope you know that i'm devoted
Know i won't go change for no one
Yeah i know it's hard to cope with
And you're tryna be supportive
But you don't gotta be
This a brand new side of me
That you just never got to see
But it's always been the prophesy
So mom, you see
Don't blame it all on me
I mean
I am my father's seed
To expect Keanu Reeves
Outta me?
Mama please
Come on now...
I know you'll always see me as your baby
An innocent lil daisy
Who just never acted crazy
But hate to break it to you ma
That kid just really ain't me
It's never been
Music helped me be myself
And that's who've i've been ever since
Once a kid
Scared of acting devilish
So i had hid the evidence
Cause you said i was heaven sent
'member when i made them promises?
Well forget i ever said
