Nothing major got another hit

[Hook: Dlow]
I went and got a maserati
Cause makin money is a hobby

They tryna kick it like karate
I'm tryna get my bands up
Why they hatin tryna stop me
Tell em meet me in the lobby
Cause making money is a hobby (3x)
Like woah woah kemosabe
They tryna kick it like karate
Cause making money is a hobby (2x)
I'm tryna get my bands up
Why they hating tryna stop me

[Verse 1: Miss Mulatto]
(Miss Mulatto)
Why they hatin tryna stop me
Yo diamonds they lookin cloudy
Droppin the bomb on the haters
Like my first name Bobby
I get the cash like I'm Johnny (and what)
Cash flow on tsunami
I make it flip like a Ali, got cash in my pocket no prolly forget the Clyde cause I'm Bonni
Lil bitty bit better catch up I'm running circles round them like it's a course of course
And I'm stuck on that gas, Charlie Horse
This a feature that you can't afford
Don't you pull up on me no Honda Accord
Pull up game strong yeah you know it
We'll pull up on ya like "How you doin" like woah
I'm a dime, I pull up in that 64

[Verse 2: Dlow]
I might pull off in the Audi
[?]
Hopped out this beat like a oop
I call that catching a body
Cause making money is a hobby all these bops I can't even pull my pants up
Might need a kick stand , all these bands I can't even really stand up
Why they actin so silly
I just milly rocked on the block for 2 milly
I just da-da-da-da-dash mess around pop a wheelie
Out of sight, show a body, it's about to get tilly
Look how these diamonds just dance on my hands
I'm hot as a kitchen and poppin like pans
[?]
I can show for my fans
Then head to the crib, I know I'm the man (wooh)
They stupid, Miss Mulatto betta tell em that we do it we don't need no help
Speakers so loud got I'm soso def
I flex all alone I don't need no help (wooh wooh)
Look at my tanks now (like woah)
Look at my name now (like woah)
I got the flame now (like woah)
In my own lane now (like woah)
