[Intro: Collins]

Crooks Abstergo!

[Hook]

Take a ride in my civvy
Rollin' thru the city
Girl go and bring your friends
Cause I got my crooks with me
We running the town tonight
Cause we finna to get trippy
If you ain't down to ride
I hope you got three fiddy

[Verse 1: Collins]

One key in my ignition
Two clicks to the starts the mission
Three blunts to get it started
Four minutes to find parking
Five hours I hit clubs
Six of us bottle popping
Seven shots of Morgan Rum
To keep to my night rocking
Dlow snapping the shots
We with these girls the hitting slots
They all working hard in making that ass pop
I'm judging to see which one deserves the money shot
Its lights camera action nigga and I'm the director
And I'm a cast you girl cause you look executive
The club close at 5 but til sunrise we finna' get live
Wake up with no regrets but still wondering how did I drive?
Yeah

[Hook]

Take a ride in my civvy
Rollin' thru the city
Girl go and bring your friends
Cause I got my crooks with me
We running the town tonight
Cause we finna' to get trippy
If you ain't down to ride
I hope you got three fiddy

[Verse 2: Dlow]

Fresh ass Canon about to shoot tragic
You see me thru the lens so and go tell your friend
Apple bowl heads cooling near the ocean
California swag so you know we straight coastin'
People down the stairs ain't talking Thes
Everybody wyling the party getting violent
I got a bad white bitch call me Mike Lowry
Collins got the setup about to hit the Recher
The venues nice and smooth something like butter
The sound too legit you can hear it from Bubbas
Got me a brew, smoking on a swisher
How I'm chilling with my dudes before the party
Picks up free-styling at the party
Sipping on Bacardi pissy ass drunk
These girls is getting naughty
I hope it's no stick up no need for the loudness
I'm gonna be outtie before I hear sirens
Jacuzzi I'm chilling and courtesy of the Nags Head

[Hook] (x2)

Take a ride in my civvy
Rollin' thru the city
Girl go and bring your friends
Cause I got my crooks with me
We running the town tonight
Cause we finna' to get trippy
If you ain't down to ride
I hope you got three fiddy
