I dont wana be your man
I just wana hit that ass
I know what you want won't last
I just warn hit it i just warn hit it and quit it

Don't step out your lane
Mana get sparked in the face
Mana got ties like lace
I can still cop a shotty from face
Still holla badders at late
Allways got grub on my plate
Like what can i say
Nutten ain't changed
Its Probably fate
13 stone still i want more weight
13 stone still i want more weight

Yes yes i will sort her
Leave her head spinnin like a saucer
Ofc the pussy bomb just like a mortar
Her lotus wet b.o.b water
I swear god forsakes me
If i ever have a daughter
Hell no you won't see me at a altar
Tryna be rich fat stacks porter
Tryna be rich fat stacks porter

Might holla me a uckers deamon
My love for money
She got love for seaman
Im down for beating
She out for breeding
Like whats the meaning Of this
Their taking the piss
Wana trap a trap nigga quick (woop)
She put on a show no sickabit
If she want d on the low
I might dip in it
Make it strech no reed
Not illiterate
Mic in the booth
Im ripping it

The Flow be ill
Im admitting it
Getting it going
Sunmer its snowing
Comming and going
If i see my g im checking him
If a gyal warn link
Im wrecking it
I got shit to do
I could never 24/7 it
Still i gotta thank above
Cos shes heaven sent
And i thank again
That my soul ain't left

I dont wana be your man
I just wana hit that ass
I know what you want won't last
I just warn hit it i just warn hit it and quit it
