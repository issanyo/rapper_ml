[Verse 1]
Just another day, another plate of spaghetini
And dreaming, wonder if I'll ever meet my genie
To release me and to teleport me to a scene where
I can soak in all the adoration for my T tales
But the fantasizing halts when my alarm rings
Snaps me back to the underwhelming song that God sings
Just let me know of the arrival of my luck
Till then I am just another delusional fuck

[Hook]
I just wanna disappear
I want my soul to roam
I just wanna disappear
Until I find my home

[Verse 2]
Look at that, she noticed you
Now she wants to converse
Interested to roll with you
Wants to see your concerts
Wants to be your ride or die
Wants to have your children
Wants to be your writer dye
Help you make a killing
But the fantasizing halts when my alarm rings
Snaps me back to the underwhelming song that God sings
Just let me know of the arrival of my luck
Till then I am just another delusional fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
All hail the ruler
More holy than a God, Jah, or Buddha
To Zeus they dedicate their lives to
Join the cult, become a Zeus disciple
But the fantasizing halts when my alarm rings
Snaps me back to the underwhelming song that God sings
Just let me know of the arrival of my luck
Till then I am just another delusional fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
No longer dreaming and now I'm taking action
Putting in 110% and never slacking
Never lack in effort to avoid the realistic demons
And continue to live my life as if I'm lucid dreaming
But the fantasizing halts when my alarm rings
Snaps me back to the underwhelming song that God sings
Just let me know of the arrival of my luck
Till then I am just another delusional fuck

[Hook]
