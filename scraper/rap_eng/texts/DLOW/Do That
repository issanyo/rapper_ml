Bestie

[Chorus]
Squizin' on that booty in your pants
How you do that?
Tellin' your friends I'm your man
Why you do that?
You takin' the lost, I don't know
How to do that
And if you want to keep it on the low
We can do that

Tell me how you that [How you do that?]
How you do that? [How you do that?]
Shorty, how you do that? [How you do that?]
How you do that? [How you do that?]
Tellin' your friends I'm your man
Why you do that? [Why you do that?]
Want to keep it on the low
We can do that

[Verse 1]
How you make the bad things look so good
How you make a look girl look so [?]
How you make a nigga really really wish you good
How you don't smoke, but you rollin' up the hood
How can you take me out my zone?
And you the reason I can't even go home
You got me textin', got me blowin' up your phone
Is that you right, you can tell me I'm wrong

Just wanna know, how she move it move it
How she do it, do it, how she shakin'
How she losin', losin', how she losin', losin'
Is it fake?
[?] she do it, do it, Shorty do it, do it
Do it [Shake], Shorty move it, move it
Let me see you move it

[Chorus]
Squizin' on that booty in your pants
How you do that?
Tellin' your friends I'm your man
Why you do that?
You takin' the lost, I don't know
How to do that
And if you want to keep it on the low
We can do that

Tell me how you that [How you do that?]
How you do that? [How you do that?]
Shorty, how you do that? [How you do that?]
How you do that? [How you do that?]
Tellin' your friends I'm your man
Why you do that? [Why you do that?]
Want to keep it on the low
We can do that

[Verse 2]

[Outro]
Squizin' on that booty in your pants
How you do that?
Tellin' your friends I'm your man
Why you do that?
You takin' the lost, I don't know
How to do that
And if you want to keep it on the low
We can do that
