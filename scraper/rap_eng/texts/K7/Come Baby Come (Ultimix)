Bounce come on bounce
Bounce come on bounce
I slam the door (boom)
When i come into the bedroom (wham bam)
'cause i'm the king of the castle (na na na)

Turn me on turn me loose
(come on come on)
Try to hit it
It's a hassle
Come and get some of this
Don't forget innuendo
Play me like nintendo
Never let go
Screaming so loud
You'll be hitting the crescendo
Doh ray me fa sol la te doh

Chorus:
Come baby come
Baby baby come come
Come baby come
Baby baby come come

Well you gotta give me lovin'
And you gotta give me some
You gotta give me lovin'
And you gotta give me some

Well i can hear the (ring ring ring)
The telephone goes ring (hello hello)
But we're still getting busy
(pump pump pump huh)

Now you're getting dizzy
I can slow it down
So you can pump it (pump it)
Then i can move it fast
So you can pump it (pump it)

Two balls and a bat
The pitchers wears a hat
Sliding into home base
Trying to hit a home run
Swing batta batta batta
Batta batta swing

Chorus

Bounce come on bounce
Bounce come on bounce
Tell me do you it like that (yeah yeah)
Do you want a little more (yeah yeah)
Now tell me do you love me (yeah yeah)
Come on (do you love me)

Straight up now tell me
Bounce come on bounce
Bounce come on bounce

Bounce come on bounce
Bounce
Come baby come
Baby baby come come
Come baby come baby baby
Come come
You gotta give me lovin'
And you gotta give me some
