Well I woke up this morning with the feeling of rejection
Called your name and you gave me no attention
You didn't care how I feel inside
But like a fool I've been when I swallowed my pride
But you just don't care
You turn away and you act like I'm not there
Into my loneliness I fade away
I only got one thing to say

I love to turn you on
I love to turn you on
I love to turn you on
Come on so I can give you some more
I love to turn you on
I wanted you for oh so long
And now that you're gone
(You know?)
I wish that I could turn you on

Zunga zunga bazunga zeng
Zunga zunga bazunga zeng
Zunga zunga bazunga zeng
Fuck this place 1-2 1-2 let's do it together now
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah yeah)
Zunga zunga bazunga zeng
Zunga zunga bazunga zeng
Zunga zunga bazunga zeng

It's such a mystery the things that you do to me
I don't know whether to laugh or to cry
Sometimes I feel so free
But then when you're with me
The pressure makes me feel like I'm gonna die
You drive me crazy and don't give me time to think
And then you say that you're runnin' away
Till I find out the truth for me and you
I just got one thing to say

I love to turn you on
You know I turn you on
I love to turn you on
With a kiss from my lips I turn your body on
I love to turn you on (Rock to the rhythm!)
I wanted you for oh so long
And now that you're gone
I wish that I could turn you on

Y yo te beso (Como te gusta)
I wanna kiss ya (tell me ya like it)
Y yo te amo (Como te gusta)
I'll give you love, girl (Tell me ya like it)
Te necesito un poquito por la noche
Y un besito, amorcito a las doce
Y cada hora por hora se√±ora, hasta esta hora
Que vamos tan bien que voy por coche
Y yo te hablo (Como te gusta)
Talk to ya (Tell me ya like it)
Te toco eso (Come te gusta)
[?] right stuff (Just like ya like it)
Well in a minute I'll be in it if ya let me
And if you wanna try to find me come and get me
I take ya deeper and deeper you're getting weaker and weaker
I'll make sure that you never forget me

I love to turn you on
I love to turn you on
I love to turn you on
I wanted you for oh so long
And now that you're gone
I wish that I could turn you on

Zunga zunga bazunga zeng
Zunga zunga bazunga zeng

Move move, come on come on
Hey ladies let your bodies go
Move move come on come on
Choir sing!
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah yeah)
