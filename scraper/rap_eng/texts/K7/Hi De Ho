Swing it, oh

I met a Puerto Rican girl on a Sunday
Stood in her house until Monday
Tuesday, she fell in love with me
And by Friday, she one of my baby

You see her boyfriend always used to treat her badly
(Why?)
Because she used to play it, dirty
(Oh)
One day, she'll do the same to me
But for now I'm takin' it easy

Hi de hi de hi de hi
(Hi de hi de hi de hi)
Ho de ho de ho de ho
(Ho de ho de ho de ho)

He de he de he de he
(He de he de he de he)
Hi de hi de hi de ho
(Hi de hi de hi de ho)

Za zu za zu za zu zay
Za zu za zu za zu zay

Swing it, hey
Swing it
Zum chaca zum, zum chaca zum
Zum chaca zum

I used to hang out with this kid from Brooklyn
(Brooklyn)
Who stole my girl when I wasn't lookin'
(Lookin')
That punk tried to play me out
But I'ma set him up on the right road, yeah

You see I'm catchin' him at the local disco
Doesn't matter if he's New York or 'Frisco
I'm gonna put that head to bed
And when it's over the subject is dead
(Ooh)

Hi de hi de hi de hi

Ho, swing it, hey
Here we go, come on, here we go, come on
(Here we go, come on, here we go, come on)
Here we go, come on, here we go, come on
(Here we go, come on, here we go, come on)

I walk down the street, bobbin' to the rhythm
Hangin' with my friends, but I'm hardly ever with 'em
If I have static, I just drop a dime
(What's up?)
And they're with me in no time

And when I swing
(We swing)
And when we throw
(Here we go)

Throw up your hands and just say, ho
(Ho)
Meet me around the corner at a quarter to ten
And don't forget to bring your punk friend
(Yeah)

Can we get a little weezy?
Swing it around and up and down and up
Can we get a little weezy?
Swing, left, right, left, right, swing, swing, yeah

Have fun, have fun, have fu, have, have fun
