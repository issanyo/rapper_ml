Kiss me like you kissed me
Come and show me that you missed me
And do the things you never did before
Wrap your arms around me
I’m so happy that you found me
Cuz you’re the one that I adore
And nobody could ever truly please you
Cuz no one ever truly cared (no one could ever care)
And I will never be the one to tease you
Reach out for me and I’ll be there (go go go go)
Rock
Come on rock my body fast
Hold on and never let me go
Then rock my body slow (Rock my body rock)
Rock
Come on rock my body slow
Hold on and make it last
Then rock my body fast (Rock my body rock)


Kiss me like the last time
Tell me that you’ll always be mine
And that no one will take my place
Jealousy's inside me
But my heart and soul will guide me
Cuz with our love there’s no time to waste
And I could never be the one to leave you
So I’ll make it last for ever (make it last forever)
Trust in me and I will believe you
And we will be together
Rock
Come on rock my body fast
Hold on and never let me go
Then rock my body slow (Rock my body rock)
Rock
Come on rock my body slow
Hold on and make it last
Then rock my body fast (Rock my body rock)
Rock
Come on rock my body fast
Hold on and never let me go
Then rock my body slow (Rock my body rock)
Rock
Come on rock my body slow
Hold on and make it last
Then rock my body fast (Rock my body rock)



Rock the body body
Rock the body body
Rock the body body
Rock the body body



I will never be the one to leave you
So we’ll make it last for ever (Make it last forever)
Trust in me and I will believe you
And we will be together
