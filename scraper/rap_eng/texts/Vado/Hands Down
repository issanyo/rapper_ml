[Verse 1: Vado]
Pop bottles if you work it, waste dollars on purpose
Blow it fast, summer trucks can't follow our hearses
Yeah, they can't follow our hearses, let me know if you can't follow the versus
I'm the man now, I'm the man now
I get em aired now, let me hear the fans loud
Got the inside sand brown, start it up vroom vroom make the lamb growl
Weed that my damn pal
Keep the broads coming
We in the club two minutes keep the cars runnin'
You dont want me to start frontin
Touch the handle unlock no car button

[Hook: Vado] x2
I got em hands down, I'm the man now
I got em hands down, I'm the man now
I got em hands down, I'm the man now
I'm the man now, I'm the man now

[Verse 2: Vado]
I got the hands down, I'm the man now
I demand child looking at a man child
Just before got my famz proud
I'm here now, Pink Mink going Cam style
Hundred Gram pounds, I don't trap much
I'm in the back what 4 posite black ups
Both pocket stacked up you a track smut so tell em back up
You're coming like mack track, you frontin get clapped up what's your name ho
I'm back stage low holla like ayooo
Lot of thing, lot of fame let the chain gloo
Let it rain, let it aim let that thing go!

[Hook: Vado] x2

[Verse 3: Vado]
What's the plan now turning your head pal
Don't get ran down with beef we plan pals
Shout out to Cam child light skinning bull getting higher then Cham brown
My whole camp wild (most hate it)
I ain't the only one to know, (we all made it)
Lenox ave gang we're living the fast lane
We get it fast spending fast relaxing, most of you niggas procrastinating
Addition that trash cans so put them in trash cans
What's popping what's happening
Trapping out from the gutter plus I'm a Mack man
