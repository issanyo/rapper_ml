[Verse 1: Vado]

A-yo I dont fuck with the beef,let the haters hate
I had to jog on a paper chase
And get my flow running like some bathing apes
Far as the mixtape I made them wait
Sorry for that,but im back like I felt sorry for rap(Vado)
Level hardy and black jack
To match the strap hat,relax my patch strap with mats
Sling crack for crack
Just to lean back in the cadillac or act and count stack for stack
My team strong like cognac,you ain't ready for combat,being a thug came in your contract
Use a gimmick they love how the swag attract woman every minute and running through there back like amen
Gripping the smith yeah im nice like a bottle is if you in the christ im a model the bent(basic)
I take it back like a-6's in tha pair a-6's you can't say shit cause I space shit

You got to get yours
I got to get mines
So be ready for war
When you crossing that line
Lay the table with raw
Break it all in a dime
Just be able to score
When its all in the line

[Verse 2: Vado]

I'm who they hatin on
Thats why I listen to trap pitch trap and get my thug motivation on
Yellow lift strong rubber-band with the Jacob on
Now you see why my dick is why dimes gone wake up on
It ain't hard to tell im popping
Its like im in jail,the booth is my cell,and im bout to lock it
Cops checking with true religion pocket the rock in,i be cool like the movie the rock in,heavy jews rocking
I'm in a 500 but its a ford with a slide finer than Melyssa Ford (its nothing)
Most of my dog dress mad bummey,never floss,but blow s-class money,on that best grass money
You gone remember me god,the game need me like a memory card,yall just pretend to be hard
Try stuntin all ya men and be robbed,im not frontin all ya men and get scarred

[Hook] X2

You got to get yours
I got to get mines
So be ready for war
When you crossing that line
Lay the table with raw
Break it all in a dime
Just be able to score
When its all in the line
