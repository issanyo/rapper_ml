[Verse 1]
I hate that the world is in dangers
I hate that my girl is a stranger
I hate that I'm filled with this anger
All this nonsense they bringing my name up
All the gossip I hate to be famous
Hate that I made this
I hate how they hate on me
I hate how they put their weight on me
Can't wait on me
I hate how my man changed on me
God knocked and put the blame on me
Yo that ain't on me
Hate being vocal makes you unlike
Hate being social means a device
I'ont need no advice
It's funny how they quick forget that you nice
I hate how they ain't gotta think when they write
And y'all thinking it's right
Hate when that money don't stack tall
I hate how executives back off
I feel that I'm black balled
Hate my nigga still getting crack off
Hate that I ain't got them on rap tours
I hate it all
I hate it all

[Verse 2]
I hate that the streets love no one
I hate what's the price of a whole one
I hate I ain't get the offwhite all ones
Hate getting asked can I hold something
Or giving them a pass when they owe something
I hate how these coons move
Hate how these kids got loose screws
Fix a kid quick with some new shoes
Hate hearing good news
Hate a nigga feel that I could lose
I hate that niggas feel that I should lose
Hate I'm a good dude
Hate the fact that she lost that
Or when she found out took the porsche back
Hate that I crossed that
Hate that you still ain't off that
I hate that it's hate that caused that
I hate it
I hate it

[Refrain x2]
I hate rain, I hate pain, I hate drama
Hate game, I hate fame, I hate karma
Hate fake, I hate jake, I hate suckers
Hate wakes, I hate snakes, that hate others
Hate foes, I hate hoes, I hate demons
Hate stress, I hate deaths, I ain't breathing
Hate beef, hate going and hate leaving
Hate people that just hate for no reason

[Outro]
So why they hate on me?
So why they hate on me?
Why they hate on me?
So why they hate on me?
