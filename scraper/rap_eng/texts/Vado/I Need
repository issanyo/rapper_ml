I need, sunshine
I need, angels
I need... something good, yeah
I need, them blue skies
I need, them old times
I need... something good, yeah, something good
I need

[Verse 1: Vado]
Yo, a hunnid mill and know I'm gonna do eight more
Zimmerman and the honor hung from the eighth floor
I'm not guilty your honor, I need this cake soft
Tryna make a hit and get more commas than baseball
A beach house off shore to put my moms in it
Audemars off shore with my niggas' arms in it
Some airplay, not sure if you hear bomb with it
In NY, they think "why," like nothing wrong with it
My set blessed, awards, fresh dressed of course
Less stress, two door, the SS
Yes yes, I roll with the best sex
If my head ain't filthy then she'll be my next ex
All of y'all done put the crown on me
Showed the city I'm king and they can count on me
Pour ace for some that had doubt on me
See the face of my son and know he proud of me

[Hook: Maverick Sabre]
I need, sunshine
I need, angels
I need... something good, yeah
I need, them blue skies
I need, them old times
I need... something good, yeah, something good
I need

[Verse 2: Vado]
To see my brothers and sisters richer than me
Never have to hustle or pitch it, give it to me
Some day ones ice grillin' like, "Nigga, it's me"
Same nigga that was cocaine dealin' in buildin' three
No more pain, insane slangs, we had a lot
A damn shame we can't change, we mad a lot
I need change, G5 plane and grab a yacht
The same [?] Range that Khaled got
The same lane that Baby flies Bugatti in
The same mansion Wayne would throw his party in
The world dancin', champagne, who started it?
I need answers, campaign, I'm marketin'
For Medici to be free
Gutter to be home, get rid of that PC
A gonna be five years and they still a gon' squeeze heat
Need y'all to spray trains, Ramone and Beach Street, come on

[Hook: Maverick Sabre]
I need, sunshine
I need, angels
I need... something good, yeah
I need, them blue skies
I need, them old times
I need... something good, yeah, something good
I need

[Verse 3: Vado]
Better apartments, project floors with carpet
Stainless steel kitchens, marble lobbies to walk in
She a hottie, I'm talkin', new Ferrari, I parked it
All I need is peace, no more bodies in coffins
Blue skies done darkened, ground's starting to crack
Move more water than dolphins, why they started with crack?
Shit, why I started to trap?
All I needed was God and then I started to rap

[Hook: Maverick Sabre]
I need, sunshine
I need, angels
I need... something good, yeah
I need, them blue skies
I need, them old times
I need... something good, yeah, something good
I need
