[Hook]
There comes a time
In every girl's life
She'll have to cry, cry, cry
Cry baby, sometimes
There comes a time
When your heart can't take no more
And you'll have to cry, cry, cry
Cry baby

[Verse 1 - Cam'ron]
Listen
When it comes to my girl, I could tell it all
When I come in the house, she wanna smell my balls
"Why it smell like soap, Cam, if you were playing ball?"
Took a shower at the gym, said, "You's a playa, boy"
"Glitter on your pants, make-up on your shirt"
Gave some hugs at the office, girls wear makeup to work
Baby, ain't macking, yo
Cause I'll smack a ho, crack a ho
With a tennis racquet, John McEnroe
Got a beautiful mind, the way she acting, yo
In my phone when I'm sleep, trying to crack the code
I'm Swayze (gone), she crazy (loco)
I went to the door, turned around and I said baby
You my one, no other
But discovered undercover that you're jealous of my mother
Baby, so from here girl I blow a kiss
And it's me I know she miss
Cause when I left I told her this

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Vado]
I know
Fucking shame, you fucked what's his name?
That's when your luck changed, got rid of that plush range
The whole bus train give your guts pain
Now you stuck strange, a bum without cupped change (haaa)
Nah, I don't want to have a seat
You know a counselor? Cool, we don't have to meet (not at all)
Just hear me well, B, I'm gone, and put him back to sleep
Woke him up with this dumb shit cause you mad at me
We got beef? Go ahead, speak your mind (talk!)
Like I was with you before, when you ain't had a dime
I'm Swayze, she crazy
I went to the door, turned around and I said baby
You my one, no other
But discovered undercover that you're jealous of my mother
Baby, so from here babe I blow a kiss
And it's me I know she miss
When I left I told her this
One time
