Hey you, yeah you. Come here, let me talk to you

Mercedes and marijuana in LA it's only right my Ferrari's in California
I'm wavy kowabunga
Lighting a sour blunt up you need the power to conquer
Talk powder like what's your numbers? Tell me something good diners need something to pull
Can't fill something that's full
I'm always in something hood, posted in someone's hood
Don't get it F'd up, nothing to pull a F up
700 who want it? Gun on you, you wouldn't step up
Hit from the neck up 40 can lift his tek up
Naked in just his drawers like when ya boy get a check up?
She the bomb in the Manolo's while we snipping a photo we John Lennon & Yoko
At the bar sitting in Polo, blunt in the ashtray
I'm a star I didn't know though

Come on let me take you on a NY Ride
Move side to side let ya body glide
Slime, slime, slime, slime x2

Champagne spilled another man killed, homocide stressin'
Back
