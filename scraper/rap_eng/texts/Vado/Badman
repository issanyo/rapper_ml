[Intro: Lana Del Rey]
My man is a bad man
But I can’t deny the way he holds my hand and he grabs me
He has me by my heart

[Hook: Lana Del Rey]
Badman, Badman
Badman but I’m ready for you
Badman, Badman
Badman but I’m ready for you

[Verse 1: Vado]
Hey yo, you better call your man fast
Or fall from a quick blast
Best believe that I brought a gun in my gym bag
Just the role be grade A like six flag
Sick lad, I’m from a different world like Sinbad
One shot will pop your collar bone
Throw him in the tub, turn the shower on
Grab the chainsaw, turn the power on
We the last to stand ever since the towers gone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Vado]
I’m from a hard place of shoot-outs, car chase
Play the bar late with guns and guitar case
Know the gun stampede annoyed like I'm Scarface
Cameras everywhere, snatch his kids, make his moms pay
You won’t find where the bomb placed
Silly rabbit running in the wrong race
Iced out bullets on charm brace
Feds everywhere, like the dogs wait

[Hook]

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey]
My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood-red jam
And he shows me he knows me
Every inch of my tar-black soul

[Verse 3: Vado]
It’s like that
Oh yeah, it’s like that
I take the mic back like you know what I’m nice at
Catch him at night black, you dead, when I fight back
I’m put a check on his head like a night cap
Showroom floor, bit in luxury, foreign driven
Where I’m from I’ve seen more dead people than morticians
Politicking, Moet, bring more shipments
More minutes playing every game, no forfeiting
Before I’m leaving this big old nut
Closed Willy Burgers so I’ll be in the Jimbo spot
Just leaving the car wash, got the windows locked
Riding up and down Harlem like I did those blocks
I kid y'all not, I’m ready to win
They letting me in, I’m starting to feel like Jeremy Lin
Reintroduced to dudes like they don’t remember me then
I hardly win, I smile with a felony grin
Vado
