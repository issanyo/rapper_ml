[Intro: Vado]
Most hated
Bank Sinatra

[Verse 1: Vado]
I keep a swisher 40 de-roll
Walking down the block like Im bishop 40 below
Tell em get your forty of those
We hit em before they close
A quarter if its forties pros
Im on T im gone with those
Rollie arm is froze with no heat Ma its cold
Played the block like Ibaka's Role
Me and G wal like OG, one and Hov
Every brick we forty-forty on it
20 go to the click make sure that shorty want it
Ain't maddest lips when it lip
Like when you blow a trumpet
Dont want your shift on the strip
Make sure you throw him something
Rueger tight, none of my shooters fight
They stop do the dice I win some lose a life
My muta light boy I better and I dont do the ice
My shoes is Mike, rugby sweater with Freddy Krueger stripes

[Hook: Vado]
No Turning back Im here now
Rugby shut down, what you gon wear now?
Nigga fuck style cause I dont care now
But let me spit some shit to bring your ear down

[Verse 2: Vado]
Whats all the commotion?
Put the pier in the ocean
Dress to sensitive put away your emotions
Hit with the vulture and I dont care if you focus
Clip and the tray life like roaches where the smokey?
When the work run then holla at me
You need work done? then holla at me
Word to my first son, you white collar happy
Put my paws on the powder then call that powder scrappy
Theres no love in hip hop
Punch his throne I bombs it like the brother of Hip Hop
Step down off the yacht LV duffle with flip flops
Switch the hustle I dip locks
Hope you muscle in tip top
Ran outta squares you outta shape
Like years me mask off and take what out the safe
We only let gats off when things get out of place
By the waste my niggas keep it like shit is not a case

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vado]
Talk my nigga
Yeah I was running things on this court
Ya'll wouldn't be able to walk my nigga
What you thought my nigga?
Wonder why your money ain't tall?
Thats cause your mind think short my nigga
Fought my nigga
Who? what you do?
You's was never that
Who you shoot?
Who you screw?
Let me measure that
Which you move? One or Two?
Where ya fellas at?
Hit your crew, one or two boy

[Hook]
