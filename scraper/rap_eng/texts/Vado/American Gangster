I'm watching niggas hustle in their disguise suits
Nodding my head like I see what I gotta do
Flew to Korea for dope and need a lot of it, too
Ask who I be, who I know, don't worry 'bout it, it's cool
Cocaine mover, marry your gang super
Break a brick for a coin while ducking these cane coopers
Alexander McQueen pumas, complimenting the bad
Alligator of me and you
Lean on jewelers, tint shooter in great form
Usually acting up with Chris more than state farm
Close to bag up the pills, smoke till the shake gone
Black copy, that Akon, get blacked on with that A on
My African send me numbers that never fail
You want your block cutting throats, take in whoever sells
I don't care of whoever sells
Get the word, I got a squid for whoever sells

In and out of lanes, quick to pill of
Took a bus up the Main, knick your pills off
Break your name, cut the shell off
Bring them ten or the deal off
They ain't putting up with the guard
Then when you have for not putting money up in the jar
From the bottom, got my money up with the heart
The next play was to cut 'em, we huddled up in the yard
I sell the brand like it's Pepsi, yeah, no soda can, but the fast beat
I've been the man since my 12 speak
Self G's with a full set when I held keys
Child please, I'm focusing on who ain't pay
Never pass the coke, only think gray A
Six flags that's six gangs like grade A
Don't get hanged or get dragged, it ain't late

Talking practice, shoot any, I aim, shot 'em
Army jacket blue Yankees with grey bottoms
You ain't me if you ain't hollow
I know who hating, I straight got 'em
Niggas telling me "V, your time coming"
Just make sure it's the sky dweller, no ice on it
Fly fellow, your wife on it
Dangling hard, top Margiellas like Nikes, homie
