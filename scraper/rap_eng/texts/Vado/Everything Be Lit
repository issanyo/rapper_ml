[Intro]
Woo, unstoppable, K.O.B
(Let's go)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Maino]
Don't you see my chain, boy?
Everything be lit
Don't you see my whip, boy?
Everything be lit
Don't you see my bitch, boy?
Everything be lit
We mention our name man, know the city get lit
We lit, we lit
Everything be lit, everything be lit, everything be lit
We lit, we lit
Everything be lit, everything be lit, everything be lit
We lit

[Verse 1: Rackboy Cam]
They really mad 'cause I'm gettin' mine (they mad as fuck)
Rollie diamond flooded, can't see the time (I be iced out)
Bottles comin' back, press rewind (comin' back)
Get my team lit like July (we lit)
Speak facts, never lie
Real niggas multiply
Louis jeans, hard to find
Don Cs customized
One whip can't satisfy
More cars than the Enterprise
Know me by word of mouth
Fuck hoes, bring the city out
'Bout that? Put some money up
Talk about, we got a buzz
Everybody knowin' us, in the club showin' love
Ashy to classy, and now a nigga so flashy
Now that my chain, broads can't walk past me

[Chorus: Maino]
Don't you see my chain, boy?
Everything be lit
Don't you see my whip, boy?
Everything be lit
Don't you see my bitch, boy?
Everything be lit
We mention our name man, know the city get lit
We lit, we lit
Everything be lit, everything be lit, everything be lit
We lit, we lit
Everything be lit, everything be lit, everything be lit
We lit

[Verse 2: Vado]
Don't you see my chain, boy?
Most Hated that gang, boy
I roll through with my whole crew
Since '02, we had a name, boy
Back out, you better aim, boy
Get wet from that rain, boy
You shit stains, I'm in a 6 plane on a big range, my play toys
Hunned mill I came for
Half a mill a champagne pour
I learned the game and I gamed more
Made a close amount from that bank tour
Much success, I thank Lord
Bitches takin' my mink off
Rose petals, my J's on
While I blow a J with that J on
Everything be lit
Best believe she poppin' off, my whole team gon' hit
Hunned grams to a hunned grand
That triple beam gon' flip
Let 'em know I let it go, my nigga [?] gon' spit

[Chorus: Maino]
Don't you see my chain, boy?
Everything be lit
Don't you see my whip, boy?
Everything be lit
Don't you see my bitch, boy?
Everything be lit
We mention our name man, know the city get lit
We lit, we lit
Everything be lit, everything be lit, everything be lit
We lit, we lit
Everything be lit, everything be lit, everything be lit
We lit

[Verse 3: Rackboy Cam]
They never used to wanna know my name
Now they sendin' panties and weddin' rings
I love the money, I love the fame
Check my swag out, Alexander Wang
Yeah, you know we made it this far
All my whips push start
More jets that New York
Window shoppin', know what I mean?
Bills up, Sean C
These girls be lovin' me
Got a few racks on me
D'USSÃ‰, pop that
City [?], got that
Yeah, you know we got hella hoes
You might get your girl back
And I'm headed to the top
And yeah it feels so good
Niggas know we makin' moves
Hope it's understood, let's go

[Chorus: Maino]
Don't you see my chain, boy?
Everything be lit
Don't you see my whip, boy?
Everything be lit
Don't you see my bitch, boy?
Everything be lit
We mention our name man, know the city get lit
We lit, we lit
Everything be lit, everything be lit, everything be lit
We lit, we lit
Everything be lit, everything be lit, everything be lit
We lit
