All money worth it when you worthless
The wave I purchased it be perfect
The wave I surf on the surface
My surfboard on fire like a circus
Too much fast through the dooring
Too much checks and four G
Know the swaggers trippin' like a four c
And Memorina i love it i woudn't posh it

Baddest broad I can bag that
Twenty cars and they made black
Rappers goin' horse like a dead head
I didn't did that back in old '09
Had a more rugby in long time
Think i'm back from that roll time
Now all of a sudden they don't no slime
