[Intro sample]
As the songs going down
Eyes reflect its lies

[Verse 1]
Yo raise your glasses up
Harlem, why they mad at us?
Homie get your status up, she yours but I had to fuck
Made her move a pack and jump
Had it now she acting up
Said she knew the game but her math wasn't adding up
Body as bad as fuck, told her "won't you back it up"
Move it to the side we both high so we cracking up
My cadillac is up, STS, not the truck
Fresh to death turned out the trucks
Yes I'm next, platinum plus
V-A-D-O
Shorty wanna play, we know
We ain't gotta stay, we go
Rose flow hit break three mo'
Hit three mo' hit three mo'
Fuck it crack another case
My man just caught another case
Jump down, duck and jake
Like stay in a suckers place
Make byrd lady fuck his face
Tell her you'd love another taste
Seven days rugby straight
Moving that other weight
Tryna' get that other cake
Flying through without a cape that 63 with paper plates

[Hook]
Ya'll can't stop this playin kid we get it and it ain't okay
Break your heart like 808 you mistaken, I 8 0 Spray
Let em' know we play with ye 24 /7 day to day
Vegas table Mandalay baby I know you plan to stay
Rugby style from up to down, throw your hands up in the crowd(x3)
Vigo Casa 7 thou', Cherry gimme Cameron Giles

[Verse 2]
You hear me knocking fine
Most my niggas ? drive
Pour your liquors fuck your lives
Pull off in the hottest ride
(SLIIIIIME) You see me wavy without a line
Shady like I gotta shine, crazy for that dollar sign
Love me or hate me fine, 20 left in 80 dimes
Looking at my watch is 'bout the only way I'm facing time
Let me take my time
Even though she feeling me my baby mama still with me
I don't know how she deal with me
Work got stretched in Willily, invested in some realty
Put her where she kill to be the mortgage there is killing me
Only weed I'm rolling she know the pills ain't me
Never was got a better buzz than you killer bees
Please, you hoes sour then gimme three
Silly me, smooth and talk wild like Willy D
I call my nigga Lee, yo just bring that piffery
I'm known for balling and pimping like who sit next to 23

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This dude been a threat
20 down beginner's bet
Cardier the thinnest specs
Got me feeling intellect
Ain't had my dinner yet, big chain thinner neck
Slit game spit it best like Dame said let's get a check
You kinda disrespect, ask me who my brick connect
Your ship is wrecked, All the boat on yachts I'm on is triple deck
My swagger get you wet
Birkin bag I'll get you next
Pamela knows I'm airing hoes ? knows I live for tecs
Now let me catch my breath
Nothing less than 9 or 8
7 I might slide in late
6 won't get the time of day
Umpire behind the plate
China white of finer taste
Damn you mean that juma queen a fiend for designer lace
Love how your diamonds shaped
Throw them all inside the face
VVS you shining great
My G gutter behind them gates
(Slime!) Yes, my slime okay
Sour blew my mind away
Niggas know I grind that ye to put my fam in higher place

[Hook outro]
