[Hook: Manolo Rose]
Keep your love, cause we like the hate
The hating make a nigga go harder
Drive in that Lambo, go farther
Yeah homie, yeah we styling on you
Hating nigga, man we styling on you
Sucka niggas, man we styling on you
The hate make a nigga go harder
We created the style [?]

[Verse 1: Vado]
Welcome to New York, where we don’t play
Where out-of-towners gonna pay like if this LA
On the DL, you can end up DOA
I’m the CL coupe, not the CLA
Headband, track suit, a pair of Fi L As
Stack a [?], black boot, leather PLA
Matching blue BBs on the CLK
I’m like Rich coming through just to see LA

[Verse 2: Tray Pizzy]
Bronx bomber, 80 gang, you know my set
I heard these pussies want to bang like lesbo sex
Old niggas still hating from a retro set
The new here, let me put this shit in retrospect
You got to love it cause your bitch do
And y’all do what them chicks do
Chopping niggas down, gun fu with the ginsu
I’m taking all bets, and they look like they against you
Kill your whole team and whatever bitch sent you
Trip gang, my dick hang, I let my nuts drag
I’m in mine, would go in yours but it’s a clutch bag
You Bruce Jenner, I’m Bruce Lee, my glow up
You know when I’m around cause these niggas never show up

[Hook: Manolo Rose]
Keep your love, cause we like the hate
The hating make a nigga go harder
Drive in that Lambo, go farther
Yeah homie, yeah we styling on you
Hating nigga, man we styling on you
Sucka niggas, man we styling on you
The hate make a nigga go harder
We created the style [?]

[Verse 3: Dave East]
I turn heads in every V I play
I get fronted one extra every P I take
Tell these niggas what the business is, y’all see my face
Dead serious, thirst for dessert, I need my cake
Pull up in the Ghost, niggas think it’s dead people riding
You thought she was a model, she just said that we could slide her
I used to do the Mark Buchanan, cigars and salmon
Beach chair on first, I’m in Harlem tanning
Hit Miami for the lobster tails, don’t forget the butter sauce
6 5 but I love the Porsche, knock your mother off
Like Nip Hussle, all my money in, it’s nothing short
I’m still ducking court, this East, the fucking thought

[Hook: Manolo Rose]
Keep your love, cause we like the hate
The hating make a nigga go harder
Drive in that Lambo, go farther
Yeah homie, yeah we styling on you
Hating nigga, man we styling on you
Sucka niggas, man we styling on you
The hate make a nigga go harder
We created the style [?]

[Verse 4: Manolo Rose]
Brooklyn running with me, Far Rockaway runnin' with me
441, double building, you heard 50
Stack year was great, Chinx resting in peace
Got to learn from my predecessors’ mistakes, you got to take heed
Stacks bought the Porsche, Chinx bought the Porsche
Now both of the homies gone, I can’t afford to take a loss
First whip that I’mma cop, I’mma cop me an 8 seater
Bullet proof the whip, 8 goons and 100 heaters
Turn the music, nigga this is one of our children
From Onyx to MOP, can’t forget about X
Niggas dropped the baton off, now I run with it next
Knock knock on the door, hi game, let me in
2 milly, milly rocking by the door, grab a man
Brooklyn eating, niggas know we come for them checks
And we wyling on these pussies, we dying for that respect
Remember that boy Hov, yeah he one of my seniors
We come from the same hood, the history get repeated
I’mma wake they ass up since these fuckboys sleeping
New blood, new energy, but all up to the vets
Let me talk my shit, cut the beat off slim
Short nigga running with goons, they call me [?]
The shooter he keep moving, boy you too antsy
I argue with the coppers with my mink unbuttoned, I’m too fancy
Basketball was plan A, pills selling plan B, rapping it was plan C
Our lord got to be before he see divine equality
God, understand me
A nigga done came up, boozy bitches can’t stand me
Concrete, we the new wolves, we huddle alone
Bring the food right back to the family
We coming for all of y’all
We gunning on all of y’all
God
