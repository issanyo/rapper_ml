[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all livin’ the good life
Yeah, though it’s forty below the wind chill
And we wipin’ snow up off the windshield
It’s still, wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I’m, so happy I’m with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin’ for the mall, don’t trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that “You the star at the top of my Christmas tree”
My only question is, “Where my presents?”
She said, “Shhh,” she got a gift for me that ain’t for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in you drink, mami
You’ve been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said “It’s Dee-ricious”

[Verse 4: CyHi The Prince]
Yeah, mom and dad I won’t be home for the holidays
I’m over 800 miles away
In the city that’s so pretty
Where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
Tell my family that I’m sorry that I gotta stay
I’m with Ye at the Macy Day parade
Letting the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I’m in New York I’m still repping for the A

[Verse 5: Pusha T]
On the stoop of that Brownstone shovelling the brownstone
Santa’s on a diet, gotta get the pounds gone
Down town got me feeling like it’s Dow Jones
But uptown got me feeling like its down home
Snow like sugar hill
Chains on wheels
We turn our two doors into snowmobiles
We got our own style, no Soho feel
Put on your play clothes, how that logo feel?

[Verse 6: Big Sean]
Oh, pose for them photo stills
You dont wanna miss a moment
Where’s your NoDoz pills
I caught her looking at my Rollie as my mojo spills
Snowflakey on the bezel
Hope you know those real
Okay my white girl Veronica
Black girl Monica
Got me celebrating ChristmaHanuKwanzaakah
Rocking dashikis with a yarmulke
Where the Christmas tree at? Let’s design it up!

[Verse 7: CyHi The Prince]
First, I wanted to say Merry Christmas to y'all
For Santa Claus, so bake a turkey, burn a few logs
I be there soon, on my sled, me and Rudolph
Thugs think I’m a Blood cause I won’t take this red suit off
Ha, I swear I got the freshest wardrobe
I let my beard grow cause it’s cold in the North Pole
Her voice slow cause “I always got a sore throat”
Okay, stop it, no more jokes
You never see me cause I shop when the stores close
And my sleigh go faster than the Porsche go
Ha, I got nine reindeers
That’s Dancer, that’s Prancer on the fourth flo'
That’s Comet, that’s Cupid, that’s Vixen
That’s Donner, that’s Dasher, that’s Blitzen
Happy Kwanzaa, and for the ones that aren’t Christian
Everybody gets gifts as long as I’m living
So look forward to having

[Verse 8: Cam'ron]
Lenox ave Saint Nick
Never seen St Nick
Just niggas selling the same nicks, the same bricks
Same hustlers running up the Broadway
Thats where the snow’s at, taste it, foreplay
No turkey at greens, just Jimbo’s
Christmas lights and project windows
Shouts to the coldest on my barometer
Berkman, Shapiro, Calena, Hanukkah
(My lawyers)

[Verse 9: Teyana Taylor & Musiq Soulchild]
All the flashin’ lights up on a tree
The house lit up ni-ice
Wit’ your family’s where you wanna be
Here on Christmas night
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don’t that make you feel go-ood?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
Let’s have Christmas in the hoo-hood

[Bridge: Teyana Taylor]
All of the flashing lights
Yeah, when they shine so bright
Always for you and me
Baby, you’re Christmas Eve
If you like what you see me
Won’t you come sit on my knee?
Tell me everything that you want
Cause, baby, I’m your Santa Claus
