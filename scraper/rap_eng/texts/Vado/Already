[Verse 1: J.R. Writer]
Hit the club, different kind of toy
Bunch of sour in the air, middle finger to the boys
The bitches love how I'm living -- you annoyed?
Leave them cowards over there; man, them niggas ain't employed
I'm a boss, I ain't gotta talk
How you puttin' on? Man, you need to knock it off
I be in my zone while you feeling kinda lost
Couple shots of the Patron got me feeling kinda sauced

[Hook: J.R. Writer]
So I'm ready; I been ready already
Bunch of diamonds in the pink Prezi, all heavy
You ain't know we get plenty, talk feti
You just starting out, I been ready already
Already already already
Already already already
You ain't know we get plenty, talk feti
You just starting out, I been ready already

[Verse 2: J.R. Writer]
You ain't gotta give a fuck that I'm nice, though
Bad mami in the truck, Heights flow
Don't know how I give it up, but your wife know
I still got it on tuck, nigga -- lipo
Sick with the rap tracks, this is a mismatch
King of the crack raps, you niggas been wack
Thing in the knapsack, don't get your wig cracked
Gimme that that that -- come get your shit back
Where we at? All in, going all out
Get to talking, that's because they all mouth
Ask your bitch, she know what I'm all 'bout
I'm so sick, nigga, I should call out
Little Hennessey, different kind of energy
Sicker with the punch, even sicker with similes
Remember me? We gon' have to talk feti
You can have that -- I done had it already

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vado]
You ain't gotta give a fuck, but don't get indicted
Got my bars up without a liquor license
They hear them bars up, they like, this nigga writing
Same bitches have you starstruck, a nigga piping
I'm at a table full of devils bacuto
Gripping metal, single sipping with Uno
Shit is pathetic -- niggas better than who, though?
I'm living the legend I'm gonna be when I'm through, though
Get 'em, yeah nigga let's get 'em
Sic 'em, get the dogs to rip 'em
The next bars, I did 'em
You can't bullshit him
Would sport Jordans, Pippens around hood denim
Quick to floss in an instant, send you off from a distance
Bottom six inches, red alert like she mixing
Get work, let's fix it, you all ready
Speakers in the trunk, hear it knocking all heavy
Vato

[Hook]
