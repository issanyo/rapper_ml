[Intro: Prodigy]
Yeah once again
You know who it is
Know what it is

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Through all the hard times I maneuver
Seniorities here forever have 'em shooting down your shooter
Don't be the consequence of rumor
Everybody got shit to say 'til they in the way of the Ruger
I was born to be that nigga
There's a lot of highs to help you get by, I'll be ya dealer
When you make it shit gets realer
Money talks don't be threatening murder you ain't a killa

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
You ever peep me I was creepin with the you know
Unanimous out the canidis the beef funeral soon tho
Anxiety illuminates me, makes the room glow
Dedication'll take you high, you find my footprints on the moonhole
I've been off some time, so niggas cross the line
Super fly 'n human torch combined
You thought Blue can die, you must lost your mind
Niggas washed as ever
Holdin' on like the flight shakin'
Break in and that leave money
Strapped like a psych patient
You spent your life hatin'
[?]Fendi apron, cookin' shit
I'm karat charms, embarass arms, you penny pinchin', lookin' sick
The cities illest let alone my borough
Like an olympian with medal, gold 'n ros√©, white 'n high yellow
Name so big it got a echo wreck the Mecca
Steppin' on your puny profit, rocket to a second guesser
Obituaries on my dresser
Just adds on all the pressure
I can never let you niggas by
I'm eyein' all the extras
Uh!

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Through all the hard times I maneuver
Seniorities here forever have 'em shooting down your shooter
Don't be the consequence of rumor
Everybody got shit to say 'til they in the way of the Ruger
I was born to be that nigga
There's a lot of highs to help you get by, I'll be ya dealer
When you make it shit gets realer
Money talks don't be threatening murder you ain't a killa

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Bitch I'm the upper case P in the word rap
Dont make me green light you that dirt nap
I've been on my own gettin money since 16
I've been very constant
I don't do weak 16s
Yea yea, my verse is a weapon my voice give her attention
And once she put her eyes on me she be on a mission
Tryna show me she the one for me
Prove it to me baby, hold this
And do that for me lets get more acquainted
I've never feared a nigga but I'm scared of getting caught
But not enough for me to stop lettin off
The magnum, I call it the furious 4
Banks got the treacherous 3 we cold crush y'all
Fuck your fame and your fake love story
And whoever think they holdin' you down, that shit funny
Getting very long money
I don't fucking play witchu
Don't make me go out of my way and come and get you

[Hook]
Through all the hard times I maneuver
Seniorities here forever have 'em shooting down your shooter
Don't be the consequence of rumor
Everybody got shit to say 'til they in the way of the Ruger
I was born to be that nigga
There's a lot of highs to help you get by, I'll be ya dealer
When you make it shit gets realer
Money talks don't be threatening murder you ain't a killa

[Verse 3: Vado]
Feel like I'm fresh up out of the box with a bop no hall pass
Loose string two piece green from core craft
Killin' everything like son on the war path
Doing it since a teen triple beam was small bags
Niggas talk bad quick to show that they jaw glass
Bundle up fast when the snow on the forecast
Table full of cash weight to way to be all math
I perfected the craft how to break it like warcraft
Damn, we had a sweet till it brung feds
Juice bar got it cheap from this one dread
I'm confused you want beef or you want bread?
Cause I can put you on your feet or put it on heads
Thanks to chase I don't ever sleep
I'm in the bank with a face in the second piece
Cuban link Jesus face was my second piece
I tell em wait say your grace then I let em eat

[Hook]
Through all the hard times I maneuver
Seniorities here forever have 'em shooting down your shooter
Don't be the consequence of rumor
Everybody got shit to say 'til they in the way of the Ruger
I was born to be that nigga
There's a lot of highs to help you get by, I'll be ya dealer
When you make it shit gets realer
Money talks don't be threatening murder you ain't a killa

[Outro: Prodigy]
Yeah we comin nigga
Fuck all that other shit
Bop!

My nigga Blue
Don Perion, P
Vado!
BOP!
You gon see us nigga
You had to deal with it
Take it like a man
