[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Funk Flex, it's We the Best Music
Ayo Vado, Welcome to the team

[Hook]
They light some kush off in the air right now, right now
For my niggas out at loss and the ones who down to ride, drinks up (drinks up)
Free my niggas (free my niggas)
We getting money, screaming fuck you and your feelings
Don't make me do it, (Don't make me do it)
Don't make me do it (Don't make me do it)
Don't make me do it, (Don't make me do it)
Don't make me do it (Don't make me do it)
Cause I'mma ride for my niggas, I would die for my niggas
Go to war for my brother and thats word to my momma, Don't make me do it

[Verse 1: Vado]
It's cool Mo push D in the wild wild west
All the ballers respect me like world wide west
Denim supply vest, I bet your girl slide next
Chanel hoodie is what you think you fly, uhm yes
Don't make me do it, bang bang when that thang' rang
Squeeze the lev' when that thang' aim
Jesus head when that chain hang
We the best in that name rang
My same gang, straight champagne
Like fuck you and your campaign
My shoe strangs' and my nuts hang
Ya'll don't get it, this shit is nothing to me
I don't go get it , I get it coming to me
You blow go vivid built like a hummer to me
No Diggy, have a reverend the day you run into me

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
I say, fuck all that talking, my money do that
Getting some head in the back of the back
Still I'm gon' ride with that strap on my lap and some whip in that lac' that's a matter of fact
Still smoking on that good good
Nail a bitch with this good wood
Fuck around with my people dog and it's death row like that nigga Suge
Say long money, tour bus
Eat a rapper like cold cuts
Make a check and I blow it all and its fuck a hater like 4 sluts
I'm on one in that 2 door
Top gone I keep em' off
80 gram for that cube floor, my pockets fatter than sumo
I do it, I make a movie
All this ice around my collar got me cooling (BLING BLOW!)
I say now I am my brothers keeper, blood is right up under my sneakers
Balling hard, you stuck in the bleachers
We the best it's nice to meet you

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Oh lord, I'm feeling myself
I’m in the big boy fiddling with the suicide door I’m killing myself
Got a bad Bitch with me and a brand new semi that’s still in my belt
I ain’t feeling these niggas I’m grilling these niggas I’ll kill ‘em myself
Hold up she pop molly pop that pussy
He puffs loud we pop that pussy
That’s your chick? I got that pussy
I treat that shit like project pussy
Like hold up sipping on lean we pour up
Ask your main Bitch, yeah, she know us
These niggas ain’t wanna see me blow up
Pocket full of green like a four leaf clover
Hold up wait I walk in this bitch I fuck shit up and I leave gone
Hold up wait I walk to his bitch start talking that shit and she’s gone
Back to crib kicking him out
I’m dicking her down and I’m kicking her out
Free all my niggas I wish they was out
The best in me and I’m getting them out

[Hook]

[Verse 4: French Montana]
I fly the birds in like the Falcons man don’t make me do it
I’ll wet your crib up have you ducking man don’t make me do it
I get higher than Buddy Williams man don’t make me do it
Every time we pull up like a dealer
Don’t make me do it
Money over bitches man they made me do it
Youngest coldest nigga man they made me do it
Told your bitch “what your twerking with?“ made her do it
I’m talking hit after hit man they made me do it
I be thinking ‘bout the next shit that make me do it
Then I turn into the next like you made me do it
You heard Flex dropping bombs streets made him do it
We The Best Coke Boyz man you made us do it
