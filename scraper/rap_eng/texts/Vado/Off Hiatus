[Hook]
Not even they can stop me now
What have the flying all ahead
And every words can bring me down
What happen i've been raised from the dead (SLIIIIME)

Verse 1:
Camo cargo when shells and wells Fargo
Laughing waiting to go cash this withdrawals
My chick bad with class she been sharp though
Name Brand whore she worse than malo
Great charco four pipe gallardo
Dark low hoodie on like fuck colrado
For Trayvon I'm strapped with napalm
Running the biggest bank like this won't take long
We don't want your money we coming for straight bar
So stay calm no off spray for spray all
So bug off get rubbed off
My chuck soft drugs and car plus long
Chuck Porsche meet em Bugatta with drug loss
Discuss soft speaking the powder much more
Niggas act when they sign deals
Rent to the dealer for the same knocking resign field
I got a lawyer that's corrupted like car field
Go to Carlito Way it's a month that you grind still
Trapping back on my mind still drunk at the table
As I make the battle or whine spill
Fresh of my high haters, high haters
Reckless when I bust a rhyme or violator
Only square you ever bought was now later
Once you buzzin the hoes coming vibrator

[Hook]
And then the dreams can true somehow
I swore I chased underlie was dead
I heard the streets were paved with gold
That's when my father said

Verse 2:
Of course He on some new shit made it from breaking two bricks
Bosses take losses and workers just make excuses
Every verse is exclusive, every word is abusive
Play a third if you use it
Get the bird you can move it
That's what I'm about nigga
Crib on the mountain
I'm so far like a couch nigga
Crack this G spot a ten percent to the house nigga
Get on your shit I'm the rapper spitting its a drought nigga
New bound slippers my chillin smoke jacket
Niggas don't wanna get money they got a broke habit
Got a toe habit automatic and low fabric
You had a shot it was too late no basket
The strip dry need wet work, Rapping became first when you was bustin that check first
The second she fussing I'll be under the next skirt
Network flew me the Mexico the connect dirt
Left the prezi took the marina
The surrender corner can overlook the arena
No no hook a diva, c√©line bag on the Henna, Jeremy her Adidas
She live single Regina
She's remember whose your friends & associates for your ride you'd better know who you rolling with
No need to hide out as long as you appropriate
Balling like he Mike that 4 5 you approach him with
....Shit

[Hook]
And then the dreams can true somehow
I swore I chased underlie was dead
I heard the streets were paved with gold
That's when my father said
