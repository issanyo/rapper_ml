Killer wit, killer wit, killer wit,that lingua
Killer wit, killer wit, killer wit, that culture
Killer wit, killer wit, killer wit, that lingua
Killer wit, killer wit, killer wit, that culture
Killer wit, that lingua, killer wit, that culture
Killer wit, that lingua, killer wit, that culture
Killer wit, that lingua, killer wit, that culture
Killer wit, that lingua, killer wit, that culture

[Verse 1]
Snow flown with fred, like you under that l
My tracks was trained to go over your head
I don’t see style, show me the bread
Most these rappers is so, so, so
So I’ll just go in instead
I told vado watch, I turn the icegrill to clear face
Like a mavado watch
Your girl suck me off, I don’t know her name
I know her head was solid gold like notre dame
I can break a brick on Saint Nicholas into nickel shit
I’m cold as the sniffles, like syphilis you’ll be sick of it
She be in, niggas I be spitting with
Siph is what we hittin with
On the strip we’re getting it
I heard your verses, y’all word ain’t original
You niggas suck like Werthers Originals
With your candy bars, I’m the boarder day
And the man to mar, das

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Cam said he the best, Ma$e told him he next
If Big L was alive, he prolly say he was fresh
Jae Millz is his man so everyday they connect
I’m reppin the crew name and pull part you except
Backed out in that muzane, blacked out choose plane
Tapped out with my boo thang, strap out, 2 chains
Said she wanna hear Wale, I do it all, shit I don’t hate
I told her home by a mile away
She threw the dome like why wait
I let her play with my nuts though
Socks high, my chucks low

My team hot, it’s just us though
Y’all left the roof not so
Tell the shoot, he must go
He ain’t bullet proof, he ain’t tough yo
I’m in the coupe, I got a tough ho
If I wear suits, with the strucks though
Wassup ho, young fly and getting it
She on me, you on her
Man you want beef cause I’m hittin it
87 I’m whippin it, you drivin it stop fibbin then
This here Rollie, not citizen
4th quarter Kobe, I’m finishing

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Killer with the bars, killer with the 5th
Your girl in thirst mode, I’ma kill her with this dick
It’s mister most hated, how can I help it
I get you all stuck, like I work at a shelter
I’m at the weekend for allstars and all stars
While I’m seein p in the sky, we all stars
You tryina catch a fade, we letting that torture off
My camp concentrated, no holocaust
You call that woman your wife, shit well we call her toss
You call that nigga big homie, my youngings call him soft
These hoes know we make movies like tarantino
That’s why I fucked everything, from riverside to paladino
Young p we curtlin, smooth as jerkins
No lie, mills been fly since Adrian birth them
I’m the type to smoke a kush fill bomber
And fuck your whole show up, shout out to lil mama
