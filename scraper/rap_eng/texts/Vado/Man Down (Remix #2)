Yo I was like "Muma! Muma! Muma!
You can find papa drinking mai-tais
What you want all my ties? Brown suede Pradas?
Walking through Kingston with shatas

[Rihanna]
I didn't mean to end his life
I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night
Can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight
Fore I end up behind bars

What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

[Hook]
Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum bum bum bum, Rum bum bum bum, Rum bum bum bum
Man Down!
Rum bum bum bum, Rum bum bum, bum Rum bum bum bum
Man Down!

Oh mama mama mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, Why? Oh, Why?
Oh mama mama mama
I just shot a man down
In central station

It's a 22
I Call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
Whatchu expect me to do?
If you're playing me for a fool
I will lose my cool
And reach for my fire arm

I didn't mean to lay him down
But its too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now hes no longer living
So I'm bout to leave town, aye uh

Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum bum bum bum, Rum bum bum bum, Rum bum bum bum
Man Down!
Rum bum bum bum, Rum bum bum bum, Rum bum bum bum
Man Down!

Oh mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, Why? Oh, Why?
Oh mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down (Criminal)
In central station

Caribbean weekend
I'm planning, I'm thinking
Come walk on water, if you standing
Quit standing! You're sinking
Dancing and drinking, just hand me my mink then
Forget the Phantom I got the chauffeur here
In the Lincoln
Damn it you blingin'
I'm a boss, have a seat, watch your man at this meeting
I'm your man when we meeting
Take the Land and we creepin
Just clear your mind in one hour, you can't believe it

[Rihanna]
Rum bum bum bum, Rum bum bum bum, Rum bum bum bum
Me say one man down (& when me say)
Rum bum bum bum, Rum bum bum bum, Rum bum bum bum
Then me went down town

Cause now I'mma criminal, criminal, criminal
Oh lawd have mercy, now I am a criminal
Man Down
Tell the judge please gimme minimal
Run out a town none a dem can see me now

Oh mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol crowd
Oh, Why? Oh, Why?
Oh mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
