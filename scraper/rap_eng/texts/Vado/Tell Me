[Chorus: Talia Coles]
Tell Me, If you still care about me x2

[Verse 1: Vado]
Yo
Love, Im feeling It
Game, Im selling it
We be Marvin and Gaye and Tammi Terrell'n it
We make beautiful music like ain't no tellin' it
I tell you I love you, you don't give a fuck, celibate
I could tell you mad, but play calm
You been around for this long so stay strong
I don't know her, I never met her, you ain't wrong
Then go and press her and tell her that I'm your bae huh
Indecisive, Ima wife it
Got me and mans checkin prices how to ice it
I'm just sayin, you right miss I don't like this
No more night shifts, I made enough to be righteous
I respect that, you hate it when you call
No answer n I text back
You made your hair blonde, I liked it as jet black, but forget that
You wanna ride with me? Just buckle up and sit back

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Vado]
Yes, damn, what to do with you? You're so beautiful
Very suitable, 6 inch on your Louie shoes
Louis luggage is packed like where you moving to?
I can smell the Chanel soon as you moving through
Drake voice, you special
One niece no nephew, no kids a great choice
Let me caress you, bless you, get your legs moist
Stare at the chandelier while we try not to make noise
Few dates and my heart expand
Sex in the morning, make you late for your bar exam (damn)
As you dance for em, brown pants
Cigar hands, stars in demand, you got a man
(Vado!) And that's me, Rothstein
Safe deposit, the Rolls Royce is going streams
Walking closets cause I don't argue, I toss things
Jury pearls, fur coats get off me
Yes!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Vado
Uh, I'm getting money dear, we above the law
What you wanna hear? You love me? I love you more
Get it clear, you trust me? I trust you more
Just ask for it, don't be scared, that's what a hubby for
For sure, I'm riding to the end
No worries at all, I'm providing you with ends
You think cause ? keeps ? with your friends
That I cheat, you keep tryin to find the way I been
Like I creep
Not me...
