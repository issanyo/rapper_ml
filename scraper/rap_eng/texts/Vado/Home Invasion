Playa, hater
Turn your head round
Lay on the ground
You’ve been robbed
Wake up, open the door
Lay on the floor
You’ve been robbed

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Uh, Nigga I smell murder
Glock 9, put it in your sternum
10 killers in the Chevy
Nigga 16 with the burner
Tell em put the money in the bags, go and show me where the stash, acting funny with the cash ha?
Ok, niggas wanna play dumb-dumb
Dirty Glocks, never knowing where they come from
Bang, motherfucker get low
Hundred round chopper, that potato on the nose
Killers stay lurking and they do it on purpose
I just tell em keep shooting like they trynna overdose
Keep playing with a real nigga
You gon' end up in a box like Hilfiger
Yeah, yeah you looking at a gorilla
I don’t like no niggas holding niggas Glocks like a 4 wheeler
Cos that bitch go to kicking, Liu Kang
All black when I’m ridin, Bruce Wayne
Niggas bolt to the money, Usain
Never change them true, 2 Chainz
Hundred grand to your boys like loose change
Better hush for that chopper wanna do things
Bang! Chit-chit bang-bang!
Nigga!

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Phone call from my Haitian homie say papi got the good yay
No cellphone, no landlines, he do business off the 2 way
Call the homies, they gon run up on him, got sticks a waving too late
You know what I came for so don’t play
Leave 100 O’s round where you stay, Lord
Somebody call the po-po
Snitch niggas die slow
Will they ever catch me?
Pussy nigga no no
Running out your mouth, I’m just hoping you about it
Every nigga with me, boy they ready get started
No patdowns when I walk up in the party
Smoking that stank, who he think he Bob Marley?
No games
When I pull up in that foreign, kill niggas
Hood nation motherfucker, real niggas
Won’t stop getting money, deal with it
Yeah I’m fucking your bitch and I’m still in it
No tints in the whip so you see me in it
I can run through a clip less than 2 minutes
Bang bang, reload til it start clicking

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vado]
Uh, half a drank like who gave you?
Move caine, I’ve been Abel
Baking soda, no label
TV on but no cable
Streets talking, I heard em
Hands out but curd him
He don’t wanna work, he just wanted work
That he can handout and just burn him
Heard it all before though
Then went and copped the four-door
Told pop I needed four more
He text me back like for sure
10 choppers going fofo
Chrome four four, crack blow dope
Had em all magnets
Why we don’t smoke
I mean no speak, I thought I won’t eat, nah
I’m tired niggas, tired niggas
Quick to talk how they tie niggas
I’m on the block like who’s tied nigga
Gun is cocked like who’s fire quicker
Corner pack like those my niggas
G spots, we racking them
Church guarded, I’m backing them
That’s a lot of money, we stacking them
