[Intro]
Hey Nino
Where that brown at
I see pookie trippin off the cain again (word)
Yo I don't know you what's your game again (who you?)
This nigga back to counting change again
Word, just came out and caught a body gotta change again
I see pookie trippin off the cain again
Yo I don't know you what's your name again
This nigga back to counting change again
Word, just came out and caught a body gotta change again

[Verse 1]
What's good now pa? you in the hood now huh
You thinkin' shit sweet like they don't get down huh
I've seen you when you creep you try to hit down son
But he ran that's when you told his mans to get down huh
You think you all that guess you the shit now huh
You need to fall back before you get found hung
No lie, word from the wise, you need to skip town dun
It's a drought and them the guys I gotta get pounds from
Get em out, with Stringer Bell shit, bullets hurt and he felt shit
He fell quick, shots in his pelvis, nigga Elvis
I don't know about that but my nigga smell this, we sell this
In ticks in the parking lot of the celtics
Boston Garden got Boston problems
That George young up and down shit, force to robbin
They told hi dont come around, can't walk in Harlem
So we moon walk down every block floss in on him

[Hook x2]
Niggas wasting their time, I gotta get mine
All day on the grind, I gotta get mine
Bitch nickels and dimes, I gotta get mine
Yeah I gotta get mine, you already know Slime

[Verse 2]
All over sudden niggas tough you know that ain't good
If I ain't on the block, much that mean I ain't hood
Paid in full like AZ but ain't wood
I play to role gold AP I'm a straight bull
380 pull, waving that at your students
Youngers ain't got the heart old niggas was making them shoot it
It was pumping if I'm from the start old niggas making me move it
Breaking the day in the park old niggas drinking and hooping
Playing card cars manoving most haters the movement
I'm from A life you could lose it, you bring the mic I'll abuse it
I'm dumb nice that I'm stupid, so retarded you garbage
I fuck with none of your music, on your carpet departed
That's always done with the shooting don't worry bout it, I got it
I hit em once in his deuces, peace
I always come in exclusive, Don put me on
Never wait online for the new shit

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I'm trying get mine you should be trying get yours
Stop watching mine cause I'm not watching yours
Nigga of course, nigga I floss
I have all the wolves out, black hoods out
Nigga I'm good out, blow the good out
Cause I don't give a fuck like going raw I pulls out

[Hook]
