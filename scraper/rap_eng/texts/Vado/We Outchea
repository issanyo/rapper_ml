Automatic!
Yo money, power, respect, I need all three!
Quiet room in Phillipes where we all eat
Fine stripper, just me, let me call flee
Tank Full But I'm On E I’ll get you not for small fee
You gon see plenty racks in my pocket
Let them know that I’m cocky
Sitting low on that concrete
Sipping more with that grinding..
I rap the streets that we slammed off
Pretty boy, I’m fly as fuck
We’re all here, cardigans we all wear
… but we don’t care
We think here like long…
I spit high, ball for ball like fist fight
That .. wheel I grip tight
My new Ferrari with big mike
My b**** nice
Every shoe she get twice
Like Peter Shue I live life
No primadonas, I hit light
Hope you get right so you get left
….till I’m with death

Chorus: (x2)
I’m on the ground, time is money (we out chyea)
I don’t smile, ain’t shit funny (we out chyea)
Lock the town, won’t reach for me (we out chyea)
From sun down, till we get sunny (we out chyea)

I riding round, I’m getting it
2Chainz on, 2Chainz on
She turned off cause you ain’t on
Hard as shot but you ain’t on
Cornball, straight wack
Never f****ed, nut you ate that
My niggas f****ed and we raped that
Then gave a buck like take that
Should have taked that, I pulled that b****
I’ll kill that ass shit
I get on that strip!
Who fly knowing I’m the shit?
I stay fresh, stay dressed till the day I’m may rest
I got them cheap like pay less
Drop more, I pay less
Can’t ball, I’m hard to..
Two doors for…
Strap off my…
Her man is captain, I burn the scarf
I want it down when I f**** a broad
I let it roll in my entourage

Chorus: (x2)
I’m on the ground, time is money (we out chyea)
I don’t smile, ain’t shit funny (we out chyea)
Lock the town, won’t reach for me (we out chyea)
From sun down, till we get sunny (we out chyea)

Yeah, watch your clap for me once I flash…
Get it months early, I don’t pop tags late
Make that ass shake, break it down on the glass plate
Throw it up then I slam, duck on that fast break
Straight to the whole
Left the platinum went to the gold
I said the train went to the…
… that shit was sold
This nigga cold, trust me, you can’t touch me
From head to toe, I’ll be rugby
..crack it down, no dandy!

Chorus: (x2)
I’m on the ground, time is money (we out chyea)
I don’t smile, ain’t shit funny (we out chyea)
Lock the town, won’t reach for me (we out chyea)
From sun down, till we get sunny (we out chyea)
