Yeah, you doing your thing ma
Ass crack is seen outta your jeans ma
Let me place a single right in between ma
Ha, late nights, you could let em in
Tell a friend, tell a friend how much chedda spin
Most Definite
Whatever my crew at, it's more definite

Huh!

You ain't got no wears in me casa
Mongianos hoppin out a benz like a mobster
Pasta, pellegrino penne a la vodka, lobster
Filipino talk it to me proper
Uh huh, whoa! [x2]
You go slime, it's your time (Slimeeeeeeeeeeee!)
Throw your credits in the air and let that gold shine

[Chorus:]Ma, what's really, what's goodiee?
Cause if I get some, have her speaking in tungs (Huh!)

Might have seen me on gang land
Count numbers, Rain man
Bowling alleys
Stay in lane fair

Exo, Neck Glow, Chain Borrowed
Hollo, Ecko, Tech Glow, Wet Doe
Lets Go, Metro Politan Area
Kill em with the X flow!
I do, what I do, what I does

My nickname is spit game
Shit man, ice on the arm, no wrist sprain

[Chorus:]Ma, what's really, what's goodiee?

Like what you say? (Huh!)
Ah! Ciroc poppin, what's poppin?
Mix coke and rum, weed got us both num
Huhhhh! like what you say, huhhh

Tell me something I wanna hear
Trench coat and heels is nothing you wanna wear
Put your friend on she wanna stare
Chicks like Airs every week I wanna pair
It's a family affair
Only the fam here
Hole Harlem uptown we stayin' here
Chrome bottles, braclets and chandaliers
You know Vado ain't rich but damn near
(Haaaa) As long as his man Cam there
They like Reema with Sam running the tan chairs
Like what you said dear
Nuff talk with the g-4 on the land wear

[Chorus:]Ma what's really, what's goodie?
Cause if I get some, have her speaking in tungs (Huh!)
Like what you say? (Huh!)
Ah! Ciroc poppin, what's poppin?
Mix coke and rum, weed got us both num
Huhhhh! like what you say, huhhh
