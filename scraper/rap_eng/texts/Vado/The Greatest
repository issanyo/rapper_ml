I’m like Ray Charles sitting courtside, I can’t see the game
These rappers get deals that need to change
Too much carrying like Aaliyah’s plane
I’m in the jungle cutting trees and things
Army fatigue pants, hat on, where it’s ten for a key of caine

It’s a bigger picture, you don’t need a frame
On the road to riches for a minute but just starting to see the lane
From linux ave to Cedar lane
I know niggas that get it fast and heed a bang

Freeze the Muller, dining at Peter Luger
Large platter under the napkin I keep the ruger
Cigar tapping, ashes is dropping, speaking to shooters
Were schooled to the game by street teachers and tutors
Jail preachers and movers

OG’s I make em proud
Enough to go wholesale but I'mma break em down
Take a pound leave out the back and don’t make a sound
Bout to shake the crowd, so y’all can start the hating now

(Chorus 2x)
Ballin’ you not
You ain’t getting money stop
Where your work at on the block?
Who you got pumping the rock?
Thought you was sitting on the top
See me shitting in the drop
How I’m living you can watch

Trap all day trap all night
Money in the bank when that crack all white
Front around me, get clapped on sight
High top airs, got em black on white
Hat on right, tilt on the waves
All white xj got milk? on the plates
Know some real dudes that’ll kill for the yay
Clip spray, get your whole chest filled with the k
Still to the day, niggas need to hate
Just came from the A
Did a part with Lisa Ray
Little light joint you can still see my face real quick
Hand shake then me n flee leave the place
High-speed chase, yellow canary charm
In a Carrera 4, I got my Carreras on
Greeting me at the door, she naked don’t wear a thong
Tatted from ear to arm, the neighbors can hear her yawn

(Chorus) 2x
Ballin’ you not
You ain’t getting money stop
Where your work at on the block?
Who you got pumping the rock?
Thought you was sitting on the top
See me shitting in the drop
How I’m living you can watch

Lock doors when I step in stores
Damier checkerboard
Dough I collect like I’m waiting for you to accept a call
Your metaphors like old ladies menopause
Never thought you was real anyway like Santa Clause
You need to get up and do something baby boy
Word to ma every morning I heard that lady’s voice
Kept bud and guns that made a crazy noise
My next car all red like most of baby toys

Gat fully aimed sluggers
See me with little wearer’s hat, hoody same color
Pretty boy on the low black skully waves under
Tom Cruise in the v speeding thru days of thunder
Blow haze and wonder like who the next nigga?
It gotta be me, hands down I accept nigga
It was your catch but yeah I intercept niggas
Thought they was reppin the Bronx the way I x niggas

(Chorus 2x)
Ballin’ you not
You ain’t getting money stop
Where your work at on the block?
Who you got pumping the rock?
Thought you was sitting on the top
See me shitting in the drop
How I’m living you can watch
