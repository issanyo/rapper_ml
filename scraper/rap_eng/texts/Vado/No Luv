[Sample- 5th Dimension]
Mama's gone her way, daddy's gone his
Feeling kinda sorry for my baby brother
There's no love in the room
No love in the room

[Verse 1: Torch]
Started with a penny and a plan
Petty dollars my salary
Prime one 12 taste dollar man you reality
These dreams farfetched so the scene's hand to hand pitchin'
Born with a gift you can't teach, ambition
Born with a sixth sense
Vision way beyond my years
Living way beyond my means
Bring it nigga, I ain't scared of nothing
There's a disease, better have my vaccination
Get acclimated, now my vault voice activated
Rewind the tape past patience
Loyal to a flaw
Washing up at the gas station
Mamma, I'mma make'em watch me
Mamma seen this shit, she tell me come back to The Bronx
I'm following my dreams though
Trust me I'mma be a star
She thinking college degree
I'm thinking perpetual Rollies and Prada's with different models minajing for me
Say money change people, really nah
It just amplify who you really are, really though

[Sample- 5th Dimension]
Maybe I should reach out, at least it's worth a try
Cuz I can't sit back and watch my family die
There's no love in the

Chapter 2
Got a deal now
Everything chill now
Lotta new faces got my old friends stale now
Everybody focusing on custom cars and cycles
Def Jam tryna rush it, but the budget ain't right though
To no one's surprise it dropped and flopped
Overshadowed by the beef, Triple C hot
Fuck it I got right back in the lab
Bang Yo City made a splash
Now I'm touring but the corner where I really get my cash
I'm like, Damn
So many bills a nigga still struggling
Too much money getting made, why'm I still hustling?
Tryna avoid Momma's toldya so (toldya so)
But I still live way better than niggas with diplomas though
Yeah, Inseparable, now we barely speak
It's MMG till I die, Nut, RIP
They say money change people, really nah
It just amplify who you really are, really though

Maybe I should reach out, at least it's worth a try
Cuz I can't sit back and watch my family die
There's no

[Verse 3: Vado]
Padded Philippe, Dinner platter philippe?
Chanel pattern complete, like Pour a pack? and I peaked
Status when heat, keep automatics to sweep
Shopping in Paris for sneaks, the style the fabric is cheap
Had to play cotton club, like Cab Calloway
Red wine, dining with two glasses of Cabernet
Put the jack away pull a rabbit out saturday
Hit the streets at noon, make a movie, matinee
(HUH) I love to floss what some say
Like Ross, bullets get you Torched from Gunplay
Need an eighth, OK, make sure son straight
Both hands powdered up, like I finished the funnel cake
(HA) Fire Lansky, fill the pantry
Pots and pans need when I'm whipping it get me antsy
To bring it back, and break it down like a stampede
Family first, I got it tatted from Andy

[Sample- 5th Dimension]
Maybe I should reach out, at least it's worth a try
Cuz I can't sit back and watch my family die
There's no love in the room
It's almost empty
There's no love in the room
Oh god we don't have any
There's no love in the room
It's almost empty
There's no love in the room
Oh god we don't have any
