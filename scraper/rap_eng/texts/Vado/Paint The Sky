"You're undercut by all the amateurs. It's the amateurs who make it tough for the professionals. - . From mooching and being able to pass off their bullshit

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I've seen a hoop dream turn to a death wish
Get into trouble, no problem. You're on the guest list
They wonder how we got trapped in it, my guess is
It's reckless when you're young, black and you restless
Been up the streets this week and all
Conversation breached the wall
Ain't no secrets y'all, you're speaking tall
But got a small way of thinking if you're thinking you're better
Ain't a dollar made to keep shit together
I'm knee deep in the gutter
My dawg said he go to sleep in his color
He hit the blunt, took the world, and got the reaper to stutter
A year spared from a weeping mother
My scars outside don't match the ones I keep in under
Bet you the devil ain't going to sleep this summer
The heat'll come and leave your ass cold, you're holding a number
Humble down if you ain't from the town
Talking like you're running shit
And you just run around, when it all goes down

[Hook: LLoyd Banks]
Forever, I'ma stay alive
Bred to handle anything, yeah, put here to rise
Let the purple flowers, paint the sky
Still taking chances, rather not make it by
Forever I'ma keep it real
Brought up in the field, another dream for the street to kill
We hope the money ease the mind
I need a way out like I need to rhyme

[Verse 2: Vado]
This life is a drug homie and I been an addict
Can't talk money if you never had it
You never was made from a better average
I'm here to become a King like Coretta marriage
Beretta packed it, get together a package
Grease covered with plastic and it bubbles for traffic
I'm bumping you bastards when I mob through
Put a hole in one, yeah, we play golf too
No controllers, I over power this rap biz
Weed louder than Khaled ad-libs
Breathe sour laughin with Fat Diggs? mad kid
Funny how all the rats where the trap is
Guess it's too much cheese to be getting
Flip what? You only turn keys in the ignition
Ten hut, keep the army in position
My army the commission, we all meet in tradition
What's up?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Little homie set up for a brutal living
Hope ya momma put a bid in cause her dude in prison
You know who's always there and who's been missing
Kind of what you're used to with no supervision
Clean yourself up and resume the mission
Still trying to avoid collision so I'm riding out wit Coupe precision
Rumors carried by young niggas and stupid women
Go on, that's forbidden, here's to my new beginnings
Rims spinning, I'm through walking
You don't really want shit with me, dawg, you're moon barking
My clothes come in two, I need a few coffins
Tell'em I did it my way then take my shoes off them
Ending this like the movie paper views often
Old cowards spreading knowledge that the fools taught them
Though many got the same minds, I won a huge portion
I hit the lye, get high, hear my crew talking

[Hook]
