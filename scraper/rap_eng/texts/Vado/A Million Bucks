[Intro: Fatman Scoop]
Like a million bucks
Like a million bucks

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Flyer than the boy in the Carolina Blue
Before the bald head, team red who knew?
Trigga trife OG nigga soo woo
Can't forget Jah and Bang they our blood brothers too
3 birds in the drawer I am in the zone
Went from selling raw now I'm selling tours, gone
Out the hood out ya league fuck it don't play
I put the paws on you like Lil Scrappy
Beating up the beat, heating up the street
I'm on another level nigga you cannot compete
Ain't no competition man these other niggas weak
And they catch feelings like the women that I meet
And they all say that I'm charming cool with it
And it don't help that my smile too crooked
And just not to mention that my styles too jiggy
Troy Ave mother fucker I'm from New York City

[Hook: Fatman Scoop]
Like a million bucks
Like a million bucks
Like a million bucks
Like a million bucks
Get money
Like a million bucks
Get money
Like a million bucks

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
On the West, Gangstas still real as fuck
Where I'm from a hundred thousand like a million bucks
Old faggot ass police tryna kill my buzz
No disrespect to God but in a bill I trust
On the real I bust, til a mil I touch
Knew exactly what to buy I had to feel that rush
Status symbol every single steering wheel I push
Damn near snapped a bitch neck let her feel that thrust
Bought a 7-foot safe I'm tryna fill that up
Reinvest in real estate I'm tryna live like Puff
Slap a rapper go to jail I guess I'll live like Puff
All ready, all petty jewelry get tucked
All Chevys get cut, then I lift the bitch up
Candy paint by the grill, leather seats in the guts
Ever been through a raid, keep your wrists out them cuffs
Lost a zone in the toilet I had to master the flush

[Hook: Fatman Scoop]
Like a million bucks
Like a million bucks
Like a million bucks
Like a million bucks
Get money
Like a million bucks
Get money
Like a million bucks

[Verse 3: Rocko]
They got millionaire tastes with a happy meal budget
While I fead my whole team thats a million mother fuckers
Use to serve my nigga pop, he my number one customer
Lord forgive me for my sins, ain't no pride was a hustler
One day I'll touch a lot, but for now I touch a little
They dreaming bout a mil stomach still touching my ribs
Took chance after chance risked it all its all at stake
Get in my way get ate fuck it we now want a steak
Said fuck it took some chickens you want beef I bring the herd
(?) in that paper, give a damn thats my word
No pork on my fork still go ham with the yam
Patty cake your bakers man, whip it fast just like Cam
If its dry you gone lose, sell it fast as you can
Million rubberbands, fill 'em up, thats the plan
But the past thats the past, presently I'm up like fuck
Pull up in a million bucks looking like a million bucks

[Hook: Fatman Scoop]
Like a million bucks
Like a million bucks
Like a million bucks
Like a million bucks
Get money
Like a million bucks
Get money
Like a million bucks

[Verse 4: Vado]
Ohh, okay then if its money I'm way in
Told light skin (?) if he frontin' that ain't him
(?) for my Js and move rocks like cavemen
Most hoes be chasin' once I pose with the Mase grin
It's ya last chance, dance floor lets dance
Inside my sweatpants no less than 10 bands
Chick had to choose I was always the best man
Have more loose spaceships than Jetson
I'm just saying you you, you ain't I
I shoot, the aim high
Got coupe but can't drive
My shoes be AI, my crew you wave hi
Okay ma, take these two now say bye
Slow down son your killin' 'em
Bring them dimes in, let me see if I'm feelin' 'em
Leather bomber, fur collar, Chinchillin' 'em
Been a monster, few commas, hundred millin' 'em

[Hook: Fatman Scoop]
Like a million bucks
Like a million bucks
Like a million bucks
Like a million bucks
Get money
Like a million bucks
Get money
Like a million bucks
