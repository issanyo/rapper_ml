Chorus:
Let me keep it, keep it
Cause I ain’t get enough, I ain’t get enough, I ain’t get enough
Cause that’s what she do , what’s she doing
Keep wine on that pole, wine on that pole, wine on that pole
Look how we own it, aha
…the moment, aha!
She keeps calling me, call, call, call
I ain’t get enough, I ain’t get enough

[Styles P]
I ain't' get enough cause I ain't get enough
Got me looking at a body like I’mma hit her up
I love the way she move, I love the way she dance
She got my money flying up, yeah, my money flying up
Got me thinking to myself that I ain’t high enough
More bottles, more bed, fuck her up and tie her up
Yeah, six am in the six benz
That’s my split frame, doing split friend
I told this what’s she doing
What you do for me? Yeah, you for me
No religion, it’s a true story
I ain’t getting enough, so I’mma rip it up

[Hook]
Cause she fine, she falls
Cause she doing that thing like she supposed
And she fly, and she knows it
But she’s going on for that paper, and she’s going on for that paper!

Chorus:
Let me keep it, keep it
Cause I ain’t gettin enough, I ain’t getting enough, I ain’t getting enough
Cause that’s what she do , what’s she doing
Keep wine on that pole, wine on that pole, wine on that pole
Look how we own it, aha
…the moment, aha!
She keeps calling me, call, call, call
I ain’t get enough, I ain’t get enough

[Sheek Louch]
Up and down, spin around, turn your body upside down
To the bank, body playing
Come take somebody’s purple drink!
Worked the pole, then come hit this weed and let them work your soul
Make it rain, throwing money at you was my only goal
Damn girl, where you learned that? How you make it clap?
Almost climaxing and you’re only sitting on my lap
I ain’t get enough of you, I’m trying to take anything you got
Like the comfort of your hood, so I fuck with you
Maserati, looking like you jog , and you do Pilates
Ice is so cold, but this bitch is like the perfect hottie
Dance for me, as a matter of fact dance for my men for me
Think of girl, of everything you’re doing in my pants for me!

Chorus:
Chorus:

[Jadakiss]
You know that we all gonna die
So I’mma live it up
Hustling is in my blood, I can’t give it up!
I’mma pop a couple bottles, spend a couple bucks
But I don’t want a lap dance, I just wanna fuck
There's weed being passed, pills being popped
Yeah, we’re drinking champagne, but we’re still taking shots
It’s just money in the air, money on the floor
When they start kicking in, that’s when I wanna start
Now they’re looking for the water, I blow another quarter
We will meet at the crib, after party for the slaughter
Most of them showing love, but some is acting tough
And this sack is looking right, but I ain’t get enough

Chorus:
Let me keep it, keep it
Cause I ain’t gettin enough, I ain’t getting enough, I ain’t getting enough
Cause that’s what she do , what’s she doing
Keep wine on that pole, wine on that pole, wine on that pole
Look how we own it, aha
…the moment, aha!
She keeps calling me, call, call, call
I ain’t get enough, I ain’t get enough

[Vado]
She knows what she’s doing, she grinds
I love what she’s doing, she’s mine
She saw that D black tattoo and it caught her eye
She say that I talked to a different
Real talk, I’m into the pimping
She out a king of diamonds, flowing but just for stripping
Eyes blue, but her body right
Style hard and that ass tight
First class for that one night
Two girls and they’re both piped
Uh, uh, uh it’s what you do to me
Pulling that drunk kick is how you move for me!
Yellow gold and the accent
Head game is like aspirin
…gotta pop that, let me know how that back bent!
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Baby, it’s just you and me
Can’t get enough of that body, I think it’s time to leave!

Chorus:
Let me keep it, keep it
Cause I ain’t gettin enough, I ain’t getting enough, I ain’t getting enough
Cause that’s what she do , what’s she doing
Keep wine on that pole, wine on that pole, wine on that pole
Look how we own it, aha
…the moment, aha!
She keeps calling me, call, call, call
I ain’t get enough, I ain’t get enough
