[Intro]
Niggas talking that gun shit like they guns spit nigga suck dick
Nigga suck dicks
Niggas talking that gun shit like they guns spit nigga suck dick
Suck dicks

[Verse 1]
I'm like Joe Masaria, up in that Maseratti
No compairing us she be my Harlem hottie
Cafeteria after the after party
Platinum Bugarri its ice out like glass Bacardi
I had it straight, you hungry then have a plate
Don’t matter they have to wait, cooking up bagging up half the day
Ran in his crib mask on, call it a masquerade
Left em dead gas on build like a hand grenade
Here's the deposit just no strangers
Keep a 100 racks in the closet, ho hangers
All black phone poses like loss ranglers
Nigga screaming yo v you got it your flow danger
I keep the clip full when I fly
Like I don’t wanna talk, you can't pull me to the side
Only handle the sport equiped fully when it drive
Parked up at a park, black hoodie when I slide

[Hook x2]
Say what you want, say what you like
Her eyes will keep you up at night
No matter what you try to do
Shell always have her hooks on you

[Verse 2]
I'm like catch me if you can with this check shit
Feds watching me now but I expect it
Why wouldn’t they, common sense, I'm good with yay
Got a sent to my homie it only took a day
Looking man rudgy hoodie with my foot in Jays
Was cooking weight, cooking weight shit will get whoppie faced
Ugly and smoke that color purple
Go burns with a honey she love me in reburtle
Move funny that why they come to merk ya
Take over turf not track but now they run your circle
Crime square where I hang out
When niggas move the cain and be low what they at
I grew up watching bigs with the rocks chain out
Bentley on the block know it was hot when they got Dame out
Now Rell dropped in the box to knock thing out
Was drinking armeders by the box no champagne out

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Niggas talking that dumb shit like you dump shit
What you done did
I break his legs like who run shit and that A to K get dumping
Give a fuck where you from kid
I probably fuck where you from kid
In and out your hood with that gun hit
Like I wish you would you don’t want this
Talking blue where that blunt lit, Mountain Dew with my cup with
Belvedere on my cup fill, I give em head I'm fucking
Y'all niggas stare we stunting, my niggas here its nothing
Shots out to who's pumping, whose feeding them with them pumpkins

[Hook x2]
