Most hated, Uptown
You are now listening to AraabMuzik (yes you are)

[Hook: Jae Millz, Vado]
I think I'm Guy Fisher
Young paid fly nigga
I think I'm Guy Fisher
Young paid fly nigga

It gets rough outside
Trying to sell every drug ain't enough outside
I had to rush outside
Laying around the corner, corner rushed outside

[Verse 1: Jae Millz, Vado]
Even though my mother cared
My stash was the closet in the room that me and my brother shared
Don't come around here if we don't know you
My little slime will have the nine kissing you like Tony

Wrap them up, I take them all, what's the total?
If I don't know you, you coming with paper
Because I don't owe you
Can't call it, same shit, same toilet
Same day case caught it
Same 5th, same torus

Saints on St. Colubs
Fuck the bail I done bought it
These niggas is peaceful talkers
That's lame shit, I ain't for it
This like, magical Jordan
You niggas is unimportant
Fuck beefing, just get the young in the chapel

Soon as you see him, just pull the trigger and off him
Throw him in the trunk, pull up to a river, then toss him
If he ain't coming down on that figure, you force him
Make him change his mind, like "you got it slime?"
Awesome

[Verse 2: Jae Millz, Vado]
She asked me what I'm going to do tomorrow
I said I might buy the Apollo
My car from the next year
Plus my new girl is full of style, ass, breast and hair
So when we out, my ex stare

Bring them out, we 750IX steer
Set here, MH about to have us a blessed year (most hated)
The profiles on deck here, we jet lear, checks cleared
Cuban links, Jesus send me the neck wear

Been getting money before you were growing your chest hair
And don’t talk about the bank, I was just there
Good deposits keep my withdraw sex
Tanned skins on the seats of my coupe, Brian Lesley

I took it back to topic I'm high of Nestlé
Like Romeo slash Nino, but I ain’t Wesley
Make them laugh, then blast you but I ain’t péché
Villains and jet skis, real niggers especially

[Hook]
