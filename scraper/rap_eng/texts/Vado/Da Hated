[Verse 1: Vado]
Fuck duckin' drug enforcement
Tryna turn my niggas to Doug Morrises
Put 'em in position, become bosses
Writings on the wall, when spittin' I hung portraits
Waves spinnin', I'm dumb nauseous
If you got a few sittin' I want more of it
Never take the first number the judge offers
I'm in the Gucci store right under the Trump office
Are you living or you existin'?
Gotta start living, can't be resistant
No matter how you get it just be persistent
Consistent, from not become a statistic
Realistic, no lie
I'm at these niggas necks and I'm gifted, bow tie
Claimin' you the best, what you sniffin'? Bro high
Sugar Ray Leonard, it be hittin' like no mas, hah
Shame on a nigga, they tryna run game on a nigga
Like I ain't learn the game from a nigga
Ready to cock back and aim on a nigga
Droppin' the top back in the rain on a nigga
Rims bendin' the corners, bad bitches is on us
Breakin' day with the hittas, hit dirty kitchen in the morning
Breakin' haze in the swisher, that piff be havin' me yawnin'
Niggas claiming they with you, until it's rainin' and stormin'
That fake shit, smile up in your face shit
Get around niggas and always sayin' some hate shit
How you been eatin'? Ain't never hand 'em a plate shit
Always see you speedin', up down the block in the spaceship
Hoodie on, BAPE fit, my blood on his ape shit
Clip will go bananas on any tree that he shake with
Feds in the cameras, they tryna peep every payment
Move like Sopranos we only speak in the basement
Check my bank statements, while I stay patient
Niggas ain't playin', be careful who you play with
Huh, you think shit a game
Got stopped by Police, gave a different name
Had my OG give me different game
Before my face was on the piece of a nigga chain
Wish y'all could feel a nigga pain
Climbin' out the hole like the nigga Bane
Got a condo, a crib in Wayne
Nothing around but mansions, got me feeling strange

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Born crazy, late 80's and I'm still insane
From the streets, if you listen closely you can hear the train
My man got me vexed like fuck a friendship
Throw 80 at a nigga Mercedes and watch the Benz flip
My coach told me I was a loser and wouldn't win shit
Now I got twin chicks on my dick beggin' to french kiss
Still got my GemStar, deflate all that gym shit
Buck fifty work your face out, permanent grin shit
I used to keep a negative vibe, was on some Grinch shit
Skimp a lil work off the top, I used to pinch shit
Uh, I just got off a jail call, an hour long
Feds be listening so we kickin' it with the shower on
These niggas acid, I'm cocaine in powder form
Watch his body drop, then we pulled off knockin' Quiet Storm
Yellow butter soft, I'm feelin' like Ike Love
Everybody pull up with choppers, shit like a bike club
Lately I just come up with this shit, ain't gotta write much
I'm focused, niggas with no direction'll fuck your life up
It's orchestrated, how the fuck these niggas afford to hate it?
Smoke with the dead, I might walk inside a morgue and blaze it
These are scriptures, all my verses are more than sacred
It's levels to this, you ain't never heard no Porches racin'
You ain't never been 'round no bitches that's more than basic
The coke weak, don't trust the plug, then you oughta taste it
Put it on your gum, see how quick it numb
Your bitch stressed, she keep tellin' me 'bout how quick you cum
When I think of the illest, I figure Big and Pun
Put a fork in him, this nigga done, go get a gun
Fightin' ain't like you, confused, why would they hype you?
Nigga you Ron Harper, out here actin' like Michael
This what the life do, my past women spiteful
But fuck it, we got baking soda, let's see what this ice do
My man he just got his house I'm 'bout to send a kite through
Don't come around, I ain't invite you
I used to do Mauri gators, them shits will bite you
Don't nobody touch no money 'til the dice move
Just keep it tall, your mans sit and you see his call
Bitches talkin' bout Dave East from London the Edenwald
I ain't scared of death, when I sleep, me and the Reaper talk
Fresh out public housin', this life is better than we'd a thought
I want you off this Earth then we don't need to talk
Same rules apply, baby, she ain't fuckin' then she can walk
