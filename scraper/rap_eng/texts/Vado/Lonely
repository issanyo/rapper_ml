[Verse 1 Vado]
Uh, GW cross Bridging, Fort Lee livin
Edgewater, River Road, GT ignition
MTV Cribs, Phillippe in the kitchen
If I can't get it, ????? in prison
Uhhuh , yaeyo Dealer the streets fiending
Connects be 80 old niggas, Don't speak English
Get my pay roll bigger I keep Scheeming
Sayin you a radio killer? keep dreaming
5 dollar speak, ya talk cheap
On or off beat, bars up like Wall Street, YESSSS
Knicks game floor seats, Nate Rob scores 3
GTS Porsche jeep, big grill like Horse teeth
HUUUUUH, Always been swag, pimp, fly
Leather Burberry bucket with the plaid inside me
Looking like JaRule when he crashed his ride
Was screaming out my Boo, she look back and replied

[Hook]

PLease don't ypu leave me lonely I won't, I won't
Please don't you leave me lonely, I'm here for you baby
Please don't you leave me lonely, I won't, I won't
I'm here for you mamma

[Verse 2 Vado]
You screaming she a hottie, to me she probably luke warm
Need that Bugatti, page 12 out the DuPont
HUUUUUh, clean you up like a new born
If I don't do Mascata, shot of Baji at the Juice Bar
HUUUUUUUUUUUH, I got veto friends, c-notes is all I see like a Cee-lo win
When I ride thru Harlem I dont need no Benz, na
Same Jeep Duh Duh man drove Nino in
Far from a new jack, finishes a new pack
Like Ice T crib, one button will push your roof back
Smooth cat, been hustlin thats a true fact
Used to go to school with a pocket full and loose Cracks YESSSSSS
The game shaky, got some loose screws
Hard to tighten when niggas providin them like who's who?
Did the Skate King, I had a few NuNu's
Rather get hit with a .45 than a deuce deuce. whoooooo

[Hook]

[Verse 3 Cam'Ron]
KIllla, V12, UN Killlla

Yall singin like Eric Clapton, me im forever clapping
Never slacking, Velvet napkin Jeff ???????????????, leather action
Fuck whatever happen, .44 Beretta packing
Whether any weather wherever, from a clever faction
NO fiction not Nas its so written
My old pigeon Rodey box ?? the gold ribbion
Where im from check The sky, no ribbon
Dope fiends, crack houses, coke kitchens
Go getters we go getting, we robbin with no givings
All this from low living, no wisdom
So sickening, life, death, no difference
No severance pay, on the road hitching
Ain't trippin, fuck a trick, Suck a dick
Find another clique to go burn rubbers with
I get bread, bricks, white, green, red chips
But when she left said thissssssssssss

[Hook]
