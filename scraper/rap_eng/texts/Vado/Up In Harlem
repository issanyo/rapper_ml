(Intro Odessy: Native New Yorker Sample & DJ Kay Slay)
You grew up ridin' the subways,(Ok this how we gon' set it off) running with people (Ms Hustle)
(Featuring Vado)
Up in Harlem
Up in Harlem
(Neek Bucks)

(Hook Vado)
When Ayan Rich got rich hat
The blocks is strip packed
To get crack (Up in Harlem) (The Mixtape!)
Grands tour we did that
Parades we went strapped
To get clapped (Up in Harlem) (Can't Knock The Hustle)
The known mecca forever proud
You won't see Kevin Liles
But Kevin Chiles (Up in Harlem)
Where you was blessed me Big L
Party with her 6
Von Zip (Up in Harlem)

(Verse 1: Vado)
Word to Puff we gettin' it is a must
Real ones like Ruff was killin' em with the dust
Baby Maine had fiends like thriller it was a rush
Mase stepped in the light and killer was in the cut
Then came Diplomats Lenox was on the map
Where we was quick to loose it flip it and get it back
Ski rack on the range inside champagne
The whiskey 4 limp construct Timbs the Mac
Strings and tongue hangin' teams is gun bangin'
Givin' these OG's hell they young Satan's
Grab the keys over gree's they want names
And the drug gamin' big chains they done waitin'
Helly Hansen's was aiight then
Level Bombers Ave Rex is what the writin'
Used to bomb'em black Vanson what the mics did
Used to get weed from Branson now its Dyckman

Don't get along you know the drill n****
Whip steady black outside just like a field n****

You know that bag talk only respect figures

Yeah right up the block in front of the A train
Outside the chinese store go f*** with Mei-ling
We sell that China white I call it Beijing
And they all welcome me back what it do Mase gang

All my n****'s real they still sayin' no homo

All these diamonds can't see the top tanks
Laces off the Louis's no Harlem n****'s don't tie s***
Jacks baby was born broke i'ma die rich
Cuban off the Coogi I feel like Biggie in 96
Over Ace we don't talk on the murder case
By the time we went to war I done brought me a 38 (Yo theres 40 on Me)
Case these n****'s they done talkin' on me
Just thanking God they never caught it on me (You dodged s***)
You dumb pricks you never gon get the points
Still spendin' for them n****'s that trappin' to make a point
Off of coke sell
Still tryna get it whole sales
The street s*** I know is so well
East God young buggy baby the stand 1
Get a deal bail out my n****'s when the advance come
For everytime they said I was broke I put a band up
S*** i'm just tryna make a million off a Samsung
