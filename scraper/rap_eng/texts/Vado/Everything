[Hook: French Montana]
Everything I want, I bought
Fuck what you thought
Everything I want, I bought
Fuck what you thought

[Bridge: Fred The Godson]
Time to bring New York back to life like
We riding all night like
Say I'm next on the mic like
Everything (GORDO)

[Verse 1: Fred The Godson]
They say New York is goin' through a crisis
They flow so-so, they know Frederico is the nicest
Still in the streets with the blam
I use long arms so you reach my demand
Talkin' about a terror alert
I sell to whoever, whenever, whatever works
See that bread that I knew, now Fred comin' through
Blood and crip walkin' cause she read that I blew
I just got word Jeter retirin'
Right across the street the 9 millimeters is firin'
White kids wanna be firemen
Big chain on a dope boy, to us, that's inspirin'
Momma stood in the section 8 office
You ate on my block and my section ate often
Your music why I'm hatin' you
You could be Biggie son, still no faith in you

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 2: Vado]
Slimeeee!
I rap my ass off, spit your best rhyme
Louis Skully half off, show the fresh line
9/11 black Porsche hit the red line
Your G know, the smith on me like who the Jet sign
My feet up in Cabo
Load the planes, I'm keyed up like Pablo
This mil' fuckin' the streets up like potholes
New range bleed guts, the truck charcoal
It's not a game but I dare you
I hear you the biggest
Harlem names who I'm compared to
Just to stay in shape I move a square or two
And keep at least 10 cylinders when I stay in coupes
I'm on Ciroc Amaretto, drive as fast as Toretto
Till I crash with the Devil
Need a pass in the ghetto, squeezing Glocks with the metal
Keep a stash in my pillow, the other half of my fellows up

[Hook: French Montana]
[Bridge: Fred The Godson]

[Outro: Fred]
Fred the God, French on the hook
Vado on a verse, New York, what a love (New York)
I cash birds from the blow , I ghostwrite
I pass words like a cold, hold tight
We just got a new mayor
Still move the pills, the prescription for the bayer
Still move the krills, it's description when u weight up
Brick under six, see you later
Gordo..
