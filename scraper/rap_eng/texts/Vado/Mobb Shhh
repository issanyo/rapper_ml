[Intro]
And all of you shrug, right? Except some of your friends of yours and one day I might do something that upset you and you hit me. Then you become boss. My friends they hit you, and somebody else becomes boss. And on, and on, and on. You know what I call that? Stupid, very very stupid

So if you ain't doing it, who's gonna be...

Nobody

[Verse 1: Vado]
Just landed
Stepped out, red carpet
Questions asked, press flash, I'm the next target
Flex barking, about to sign to the best market
S parked it, key on me to push start it
Just blew a grand in Houlihan
Serving us drinks, disturbing the peace like Luda fam
Sight clearer, in front of the mirror, like "Who the man?"
You the man where the cooler stand then do the damn (thing)
Farazino and Ferragamo the shoe is tanned
If he don't take his hand out his pocket you shoot his man
I've been around for a while, I ain't new to Cam
Or new to the cam, since Mad Ciphers I knew the plan (early)
Knew the right people to be around
Listen and learn, then my turn came, I see it now
It's time to earn when the birds came, we need a town
A key, a pound, and the price stay, we don't bring it down

[Verse 2: Vado]
I'm so sick of them, talking Slick Rick to them
Name your top 10 I got at least 6 of them
That attach-dough, velcro need to stick with him
Start playing your role
Maybe could make a flick with him
Suit and tie, mai tais, you have a sip with him
Can't do shit to him, I know it's hard to get to him
Meet his underboss, captain if you want to talk
Before he had him a plate, he was eating from other forks
That took a care of disease is what his mother caught
Sister drive around yelling look what her brother bought
They hate that I'm all like what these fuckers thought
Harlem nigga with more sponsors than a Rucker court
My math equivalent, 10% for the middleman
Ignorant but militant
Kill your miss, snatch your siblings
Stacks in the Timberland
Boxes, packs, in the ceilings them, concealing them
Ask an innocent man, ask a gentleman

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Don Vito, Don Carlo, Castellano
Look, kneel over, be on point like guarding Rondo
Gotti whacked him, body bagged him
Took the family over
Where you running a racket dig, can't be chocha
Candynovas, owe me money? Can't be over
In the sands with girls
Hit it harder than Sammy Sosa
Lifestyle, quite foul, never made it up
Immunity, since 20, my community, gated up
Spray them up, like alcohol, play the cut
Made the cut, whole, half-quarters, orders, break them up
Tell him chill before we break him up
Then wake him up
Fuck toys, wakes are us
Champagne from waitresses
Gucci, Louis, monogram the D square
Be clear, we here, and gonna be, each year
See dear, Killa, keep the streets near
Peace gear, on the ave, with chicks in beach chairs
