My Shooter Caught A Homi
I Can't Wait To Reward Em
Uh, Your Neck Lit Up
Can Tell Your Next Nigga
Stayed With Some RL
Like Them Two Next Niggas
Hand Em A Check
Cuz My Weight Will Correct Niggas
Look At The Stock Charts
As Much As I Check Twitter
Connect Be Paying
My Cuban Giuseppe Hatin
Never Take Her Home
(Like You Leave Your Giuseppe Layin)
Tell Em Get Ya Tapes Ready
Cassetes Be Playin
Both arms up
Two Fist Like We The Greatest Uh

Hey Lord
My People Searchin Hard To Find The Truth
They Want Me To Say More
Lord I Need You Here With Me Right Now
Hey Lord
I Been Going Thru All This Change
This Change Will Make Me
Hey Lord
I Just Need Somebody That's With Me To Make Me Smile

Game 5
You know im the hottest rapper alive
Came up in this game didn't even need a disguise
They Was tryna hate they was plottin on my demise
Till i took em to the gate
& I showed em the homicide
Homie died
He was still playing round with them Rhymes
This is hi[-hop
Don't shit stop
Ya'll phonies Better kick rocks
Member bumpin that Kriss Kross
Biggie & Mater Jay Mahn
Got A little older
Got into Mastering Amen
Learning My Fundamentals
Working On Instrumentals
Doing My Damn Thang
I Visualized In My Mental
Never Was Disrespectful
I Just wanted the honesty
& Honestly
A Part of me wanted to end the poverty
I Can feel why they stressin
Stressing over them bills Mahn
It Takes Money To Make money fo real mahn
I Spent all this time up in the field Mahn
Im about to make it & make it homie for real mahn
