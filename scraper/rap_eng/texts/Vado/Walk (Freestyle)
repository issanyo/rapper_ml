*Noises!*

[Intro]
[?] make sure my voice clear...

[Verse]
Uh
Hard work beats talent, when the talent don't work hard
Cook it up make the work hard
Bag it up get the work off
First off you the first off
No need 'take the fur off
Shoot the block like birdoff, cause the birdgang to get a bird off... (yeah)
Designer name on a tube sock
Paper planes of the moonrock
Rap game like the jukebox
Let it down like AZ 'fore the 'scape key was the roof top...
Hate me cause your crew pop
Spilled tea have your crew mopped...
I ain't in to you niggas
Why pretend to you niggas?
I'm not a friend to you niggas
Fuck broke, ya'll look lost, I'm 'posed to win with you niggas...
One flow dimensional niggas
Who recommended you niggas? (haa)
Where the fuck did they come from?
Type niggas that like bein' round money but don't ever want none
Get 'em clipped 'fore the blunt done
Chick on me I don't want hon'
E'ry time the bird fly through I shoot em down like duck huntin'...
E like "the fuck is up son?"
Need that ol' V back
Goofy niggas tryin'a ease back
Give the streets that watch the feedback...
I understand I pose a threat
Man's man have no regrets
Not a fan? Then you overslept... (yes)
Like "damn he ain't over yet?"
Moncler pull over vest
Roc-Air's be the Hova checks...
Oh we call those the Hoffa's
Organized like the mobsters
Porterhouse with the lobsters
Not the type that's quick to wife
Every bad bitch ain't a Oscar
Like every dread ain't a rasta
Cartier check the posture...
L-smoke let's smoke somethin'
Need coke, that boat comin'
Real one, don't know nothin'...
Real one won't post nothin'
Take this you owe nothin'
I got work that [?]
I just want to see you win more
Trade places like Winthorpe
Cute faces get sent forth of the tenth floor of the Windsor
River road where the benz roar
Swimmin' pool got it indoor
God forbid anything him pour
Need ill sauce for this tempur...
