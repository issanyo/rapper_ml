[Verse 1]
If you want the money and fame, then pay attention
He ain't balling the same, you better bench him
All black in the chain, you better lynch him
Streets miss him like the Range with the 7 engine
Go crazy, I spit fire
Told baby, my man be fresh -- we big timers
Yankee blue 'vette with big tires
Can you make any move?
Yes, got big buyers
Drop Medina, got Molly in Aquafina
On my way uptown, pop in at La Marina
Walking through the crowd like I'm hot and don't got a fever
Eighteen hundred in Rucker, we taking shots of tequila

[Hook]
I don’t wanna talk, mami show the rear
I'm a bone crusher, I ain't never scared
Road to the riches, I'm already there
IPhone taking pictures, I wish niggas was here
Cause it's just
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere

[Verse 2]
Chinchilla everything, I'm trying to kill everything
Murder was the case, though; quarter mil' heavy bling
Far as fame go, I heard your name never ring
See me in that thing low, pulling out that yellow paint
I'm in the cut, Polo down, rolling up
I don't frown, I don't front
Keep the pound loaded up
Hang around if you want
Bout to brown Moët up
Cristal, Patron it up
Got the crowd going nuts
Like throw it up if you 'bout that
Bout to turn it up, I keep a Dutch and a loud pack
Mami wanna fuck -- I'm like, fuck, where that mouth at?
And my maid, she turns tough, I want my couch back
I don't wanna talk, mami, show the rear

[Hook]

You can find me in kiss your fly bitch, bad bitches
Or with a vixen up on diteman, bad bitches
Green house, who I’m wifing, bad bitches
Amnesia, let’s get it hyking, bad bitches
Bad bitches everywhere, bad bitches everywhere
Find me on the low, tryina bag bitches everywhere
Los going crazy, mad bitches everywhere
And they all know I done have bitches everywhere
That bottles and jays, with the models and jays
She might not never did it, but she gonn swallow today
That new ferarri is grey, that new carrera is black
That new bugatti is ...

[Hook]
