[Intro: Woman Talking]
It's funny how I used to see you every day
But on one particular day I looked over at you in the usual in the non chillant way
And it seemed as if I have never seen you before
It felt strange that I used to deny you just
And then it dawned on me like I never been

This close to you, this close to you, this close to you

[Verse 1: Vado]
Leggo
Yes, I'm in the chromiest donk
Listen to some Thelonious Monk
Blowing on the potent it stunk
Troopers open the trunk
Still scopin' through junk
Hoping to find something, a blunt, a nine, something
They greet you on the hill, What you want? Them slimes frontin'
It's never work 'round here, they make jux moves
Try to chase him he broke 'em down with a jux moves
Hustle all his life, he known around as a crook dude
Took a few pounds, flew out of town in a good mood
Bad bitch flyer than the stewardess
Excuse me duck money swimmin' in a pool of it
Nudie jeans tongue hanging out of Puma kicks
Foolishness almost got him killed
Now my shooters pissed, yeah
Try to get me for a ki or two, rope around his neck
Hung tight from the tree of doom

[Hook]
It's not a game out here so pay attention
Kids is popping thangs out here and they ain't missing
Respect the jux, get jux, no can't give in
Murder she wrote read by the book, you ain't listenin [x2]

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
This something like cat when he crossed the border
Took my hustle across the water, then I put my plan in order
Yeah, kinda similar to the order, reminds I get down
Like the mambo in 4th quarter
Shit gets real and when it do you get grilla
Cause them stick up boys got orders to deliver
You taking bitches shopping but them feds taking pictures
They bring the coke in and then arrest
You for what they give to us
Catch 22 so I'll be damned if I'm in this war with just a .22, never
Automatically I'll show 'em what that semi do
Lord forgive me but I gotta live
And if I ain't gettin' it somebody gotta give. Yes
My niggas ain't got Benz's but they'll follow his
A whole hour and a half to where his momma lives
Run in his momma crib. You ask why?
I reply, cause mine never lose understandin' of what dollars is
Undercovers trying to infiltrate and penetrate
Down my court of glory but I'm in zone and my business straight
One step ahead of them, the connect, and the crooks
So hommie if you chef or cook you better respect the jux. Millz

[Talking]
Yes sir, Vado what it is my G
Yeah, most hated that's us
U.N. Y.M., what it is

[Hook]
Listen it's not a game out here so pay attention
Kids is popping thangs out here and they ain't missin'
Respect the jux, get jux, no can't give in
Murder she wrote read by the book, you ain't listenin', listen

[Outro: Woman Talking]
Never knew, never, never, never know
I never knew that I want to be, that I'd want to be this close to you
