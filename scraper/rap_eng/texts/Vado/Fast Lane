Churches and hearse for the death
They say you're worthless if you ain't working for a check
What's nigga purpose around me, ain't no respect
Half of them don't even deserve Family First on they neck
I'm slick with the words, every verse is a threat
Run the floor like a ref plus I'm real good with the Tec
Since a young slime, I done stood with the best
I'll have you playing your block with your Glock hoodie and vest
My whole style is what your piece envy
That's why I smile when you talk wild and speak friendly
Round tables the label I'm tryna bring with me
Only 3 dudes sitting, rest of the seats empty
Think pennies, I doubt if it's gonna make dollars
UCLA be the only school that I made honors
That's the University Corner Of Lennex Ave
Where you can come out when three packs and finish last

[Chorus]
F-F-F-Fast Lane, Mazarati swerving, big chip getting

I use to flood the Island with pouches, like you want those?
My man Bet is in the front row, with fingers that's longer than Mutumbo
I can front O'z, your dun know
I kill em with one flow, my lines kinda like when the sun show (whoa)
Your boy back on his deen now, meanwhile
My bars bout as hard as the P's now
I can hand 100 grams to you for 3 thou (thousand)
But let them boys snatch it, you better become senile
See now, I ain't nothing like them other niggas
They style is corny, look at them, that's why the corny niggas
I stand in the Grand stunting, taking 100 pictures
Like I play in the pros how these hoes be coming with us
I'm a heavy hitter, you done heard enough
Nothing to prove, I'll take you to school like yellow bus (early)
Had a bad batch, so I lose, I'm in a rush
Til K told me he'll bring me some dudes with better dust
