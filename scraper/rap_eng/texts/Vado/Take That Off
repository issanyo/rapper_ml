[Chorus: Jeremih]
Miami cruising, Dade county
Collins drivin, all hoes around me
I Gets that paper
And throw it up
I kill this, booty big as fuck
Take that off, take that off
Being on top of me, this my part
Down down, put it down, let it elevate
Round after round, Shawty going heavyweight

[Verse 1: Vado]
Duffle bags unzipping, was driven
Play the stage, club livin
With a bucket full of women
Couple bands, low denims
If that's yo man go with him
I need a boy to go get em
Every car's ours, we don't rent em
And my hat back be a snap back
Black T with them black shap
That's me if my ass stack
Her hair long, her swag crack
QV and some strapped flex
Hove on it, her bag max
Since 21 I've been the black Jack
Cary on, no nutsack

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
That's crazy, that's crazy
I saw him when he pull up in that Mercedes
Why ask when I don't want what you like?
Been countin since all the money on the dash
Man, that's crazy

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Miami cruising, Dade County
Collins drivin, all hoes around me
I gets that paper
And throw it up
I kill this, booty big as fuck
Take that off, take that off
Being on top of me, this my part
Down down, put it down, let it elevate
Round after round, Shawty going heavyweight

[Verse 2: Vado]
Aks Jeremih, still be frontin, I'm very fly
Hop out of them white airs
With the blue check like I'm verified
Play the block like I don't care, I put it on you, Tom Teryiok
Word to Jane, I'm merry hah
Fuck the truth on that heavy lot
Take that off, take that off
My niggas quick to let that off
Caps in the air like I had up
I'm trapped off, too many bad chicks to back off
Da Vinci kicks with the strap off
This nigga sick like the bad cough

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
That's crazy, that's crazy
I saw him when he pull up in that Mercedes
Why ask when I don't want what you like?
Been countin since all the money on the dash
Man, that's crazy

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Miami cruising, dade county
Collins drivin, all hoes around me
I Gets that paper
And throw it up
I kill this, booty big as fuck
Take that off, take that off
Being on top of me, this my part
Down down, put it down, let it elevate
Round after round, Shawty going heavyweight

[Verse 3: Vado]
Fuck up Mitch, you be limpin
The green house, the whole team on
On any couches we standing
We tryna live what ya'll dream bout
King of diamonds we wearing
Bring the iron, we airing
This thing devours, ain't sharing
All these bitches round me, they starin
And she hoped in and got crazy
I'm swerving lanes, I'm going 80
I'm zig zaggin that M6, automatic and stick shift
She more than happy, want a quick fix
I told her grab it, get a quick lick
And I pulled up like my dick in
It got one eye like Slick Rick

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
That's crazy, that's crazy
I saw him when he pull up in that Mercedes
Why ask when I don't want what you like?
Been countin since all the money on the dash
Man, that's crazy

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Miami cruising, dade county
Collins drivin, all hoes around me
I Gets that paper
And throw it up
I kill this, booty big as fuck
Take that off, take that off
Being on top of me, this my part
Down down, put it down, let it elevate
Round after round, Shawty going heavyweight
