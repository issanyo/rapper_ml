[Verse 1 - Vado]
What's poppin'? I'm poppin'
TECs and the Glocks and let's get it poppin'
Louis flip floppin', that's nathin'
Like a lockmen, she's watchin'
Tick tockin' leather first option
SL topless '09 drop it
Your money short like the shorts on Stockton
You got caught, got court, no Cochran
Street sweepin' then get the mop in
We got Barack in
Black power; fists knockin
White powder; bricks coppin'
Night hours; strip hoppin'
Eat niggas Anthony Hopkins
Blam on this nonsense
Oh God: Anthony Johnson
No prob, grams I'm on constant
Damn all the gossip
Stand like I got this
Loch ness monster no conscience
Death before dishonor no comments
Honest, make 'em all pay homage
Take 'em hostage
Bruce Willis couldn't knock this
Watch this, I got this
Keep guap big knots small pockets

[Verse 2 - Cam'ron]
I'm back at it, that's savage
Mack daddy black Caddy and the seats Craftmatic
Lucky had a rap habit cause I had a black 'matic
Coffin ya, like a fabric softener attack static
Little black magic, few crack addicts
Killin' 'em, now I'm killin' you whack average
Black tactics, like a jackrabbit
She trife, with no knife: backstabbed it
Dagnabit, cocaine bag slab it
Don't have it? No prob, grab plastic
Get ya ass kicked body in a casket
After that put ya head in a basket
I got money in Dallas like the Mavericks
Then money in Ohio like Pavlik
Wit' a bad bitch
And we ridin' on a horse no carriage
Wit' my cabbage
I'm marriage, you average
Them bricks they flip like gymnastics
Stretch like elastic
You bastard, shit'll get drastic
I'm acid, new fabric
Old habits, new antics
Can't stand it, run frantic
Body in Atlantic
At the Atlantis
I don't give a damn, bitch
Goggles on: Kurt Rambis
On the canvas
Que pasa? That's Spanish
You'll vanish
Be a bandit, run rampant
God dammit hope I'm candid
U.S. banned it now don't panic

KILLA! Vado!
Dipset, most hated, welcome to the U.N. bitch!
