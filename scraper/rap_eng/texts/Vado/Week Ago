[Verse 1: Vado]
Ten jars on the table, what's the plan homie?
Here's enough water, stay off the land homie
I don't know you too well but you my man, homie
If you can make these sell then do the damn homie
Made a sell, got jammed, I'm like damn homie
[?] a sell because it's fam on me
He ain't make nothing for me but yet he want bail
That's the price you pay to pray he don't tell
Real standup dude, I pray I don't fail
Streets ain't that cool, that's when I brung hell
Started from looking out on the dope block
On a mailbox with a broke Glock
Your man Kells locked, shit I hope not
If so it's gonna be a lot of soap chalk
Let me put you onto a path
You can go down the pass of Harlem's Lennox Ave

[Hook: Dre]
It was all good with the keys of coke
Had you in the coupe, look clean fo sho
Every time, Every time
It was all good just a week ago
Fuckin' bad bitches, plenty weed to smoke
Now you telling stories on the team to them folks
Every time, Every time
It was all good just a week ago

[Verse 2: Vado]
Since a kid I always wanted it all
Served fiends at 13 right in front of the store
Himalayan North Face, big jeans and all
Couldn't get em in Timbs cause my feet was small
Was too eager to grow up
Too young like "so what?"
That's when my OG said “lil nigga, you know what?”
He put me in his Jeep, he drivin while he roll up
Steerin it with his knees, supplyin the peeps that know us
Frontin, a cowboy before I knew Dallas
He used to get a brick, take it to the moon Alex
Shooters came home leanin but he move silent
Never around that long, he hear the news bout it
True hustla, one of the few I knew hustlas
New hustla, some of them too was cool hustlas
Crew of hustlas what niggas becoming
Try to be great before niggas be gunnin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vado]
Good weather, hood leather and the lime sharp
My loft elevator where the DB9 parked
Grind harder, even find God
To make it to the top you gotta climb smart
Niggas getting killed every day here
There's more kidnaps than the daycare
I spit facts, make it all the way clear
Sport the split straps when I rock the gray Airs
Yeah, you don't wanna see me angry
Every day that nigga breathe he should thank me
Laugh at him when I see him lookin' shaky
I rather went and piss on him 'til he 80

[Bridge: Frank Sinatra]
I would like to be remembered as a man who brought an innovation
A peculiar, unique fashion that I wish one of these days somebody would learn to do so it doesn't die where it is

[Hook]
