[Verse 1: Vado]
I move chickens on the strip like pot pies, coke in the pot rise
Diamond cuts clean with peroxide, what if-what if would have let Pac drive
Ice the G-Shock glide, all blue like Megan Fox eyes
Small fry you a smart guy
Should know I ain't bringing champagne when sparks fly
Still can't believe King of Pop died
No tears, my heart cry like when my pops died
Hood is like the BET Awards
Everyday I hit the stage fiends see me they applaud
No diploma we got GED awards
Keep it comin boat loads don't let TNT aboard
Left hand Tec blam at your best man
Leave 'em dead chest red like he Mef Man
Less grams, check scams is the next plan
New Lam', the Toyota like the Lex Land

[Hook: Vado]
Let's rise to the occasion
Tuxedo, my ego and slide in a pair of gators
In the kitchen pies we bakin'
No time we facin', gold times we lacin'
Yeah, this here's a celebration
This here's a celebration
This here's a celebration
Cigar smoking make a toast to eliminations
Let's rise to the occasion
Tuxedo, my ego and slide in a pair of gators
In the kitchen pies we bakin'
No time we facin', gold times we lacin'
Yeah, this here's a celebration
This here's a celebration
This here's a celebration
Cigar smoking make a toast to eliminations

[Verse 2: Vado]
I ball hard as the concrete
Keep a day job on the dark street
Pots, I drop cane like I'm a part of the Heartbeats
Make you duck, choir boy, when I palm heat
Pardon me, my chronic exotic like a palm tree
Cavalli kid, she said I slid I probably did
Ocean drive, I got my eyes on Versace crib
Shotty head, hit the corner like niggas gotta give
Wear cargos and Go-hards 'till every pocket big
I'm with the boss of the bosses
True Religion, Ralph Lauren, the horse of the horses
Carrera GT be the Porsche of the Porsches
You married to this shit, don't be forced to divorce it
You ain't strong, I'm the wrong pick to take on
Niggas'll blow out your candles and have your cake gone
You niggas is ass, straight thongs
I hear my name every other minute like Drake songs

[Hook: Vado]

[Verse 3: Vado]
This here's a celebration
Everyone at the table appears to be celebrating
To determine the dedication
Was determined, dedicated to just make it
No hesitations, stay hungry and humble
Turn into Tarzan just to make my way out the jungle
Ready to rumble, they either hate you or love you
There's times I stay in the house just to stay away from the troubles
