[Verse 1:Vado]
Har-Har-Har-Har, Six-Firty Ferrar'
All you need come and get it
A key would be terrific
As long as you can pitch it
Shiit

I bomb atomically
Let the tommy leak on your Tommy Tee
Dancing with the devil
More heavy metal than tommy lee
Every time I re find me remixing like im Diamond D
Diggin' in the crate

Where Iâ€™m from a gun is your I.D
Niggas will rob you just to front on the IG
