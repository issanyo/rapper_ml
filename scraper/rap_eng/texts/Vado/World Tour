[Intro: Styles P]
Uh-huh, SP, what up?
Slime, what up? Huh, Vado, no, crazy
It's off to the next life for you, homie
I guarantee you won't be lonely

[Verse 1: Styles P]
We know what money buy
But what's the price that the money cost?
The mob wasn't involved, but shorty went to knock sonny off
Be careful when you go to drop your honey off
Money off, find out what them niggas actin' funny for
On a world tour in the spot, where's (-), dog?
Fuck around and get your ass killed by a gun of yours
I'm a hundred bars, still'd get a ton of raw
Fly like them niggas that was comin' through the tunnel doors
Yeah, in Palladiums, now we in the stadiums
Weed for my Cali niggas and my Canadians
Probably forgot the spot I parked my Mercedes in
On a world tour, I got blunts and I'm blazin' 'em

[Hook: Vado]
We on a world tour with Cîroc on my hand
Diamond bezel upper band on the couch where I stand
Harlem, YO, Queens flow, y'all know

We on a world tour with Cîroc on my hand
Diamond bezel upper band on the couch where I stand
BX, BK, Staten Isl', we play

[Verse 2: Vado]
Uh, clip in the Cuban Cuban link holdin' Jesus head
Foot on the table cause the bottom my sneaker red
Sneakerhead, money flat, call it pita bread
Derek Jeter's bread, run the base 'til I see the feds
Huh, it's too much money the crib for
Could 'ford, duck and aim at your target and then pour
Far as eatin', man, I been full
Cookin' up, hear my minute soda like the Timberwolves
Renovatin', just bought the flash in
Old gangsta spot where the niggas with cash win
Ballgoers like lawnmowers, get to grassin'
Try 'em, show us Louboutin loafers we be flashin'
Uh-huh, we only speakin' for paper
Barzini, whoever set up the meeting's a trader
Players ball, I slip my feet in some 'gators
Coogi blazers, mansions, white people for neighbors

[Hook: Vado]

I could never get rich enough to go and buy the ocean
I play in (-) and just sit up in the ocean
Close your eyes and you can feel emotion
Blowin' a lie while I'm ridin' the wave floatin'
Spot in the Ritz, 'nother one in the Trump too
Get what I like and what little brother would want too
Smoke for the dead, drink for the incarcerated
Suede parka, (-) made it
Loro Piana suits, smooth it if it's tangible
Niggas is animals, killing's understandble
You could manage the money or let the money manage you
Fuck out of here when the forty bullets is blammin' you
Makin' a toast with niggas niggas remember
Standin' in the Center, Oscar de la Renta
Shades, boots and suits, I'm a die a member
Mafia nigga with a real boss agenda

[Hook: Vado]
