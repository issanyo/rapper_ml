[Intro]
My team go, my team go
We the hottest in the town, let your team know
You don't wanna fuck around when them things blow
We ain'tgotta break em down we let the things go

[Verse 1]
I had a few celebs before I seen a mill
Was out the Memphis with the mack when I've seen a mill
Wasn't eating off the rap I ain't seen the mill
I knew my cars off the back, I ain't need the deal
Keep a still on the lab see slump nigga
No need for us to dab more than once nigga
I'm in the club, I play the back I don't front nigga
Kick you to the other side like a punt nigga
They told me a little but learned plenty
The way I rap it's clear that bottom first pennies
Shirt slimmy the Louie Vuitton worth many
I'm picture perfect Mister perfect Curt Henning
Wasn't working now will work it, serve many
Up in the work in, and kept the burn to murk any
Either a roll or don’t roll
Just made a hundred k on the road, no show.

[Hook]
My team go, my team go
We the hottest in the town, let your team know
You don't wanna fuck around when them things blow
We ain't gotta break em down we let them things go
My team go, my team go
Six series till they find me in that beam low
Chicks lead me with it like they've never seen dough
Risk clearly lit up, we're making the gleam show

[Verse 2]
Who don't floss, you blow gloss
On the sleeve of the two piece of the Hugo Boss
Jumping the 9.11 color nouveau porshe
Before you can ask a question yeah this 2 door cost (Stoopid!)
Just lit the cigar, riding through Compton bumping Kendrick Lamar (Wes' side!)
My main instinct is to mob
I'm doped up nigga I think I'm here Jimi Hendrix's guitar (Spaced out!)
I'm messed off you a safe flat
Red beam on em when we play tag
I hate it when a bum nigga say swag
I'm stunting on em every day that's why he stay mad
Versace sweat sack had Medusa head
Medusa head I lay em all is what my shooter said
Nothing fake about me that's why my old jeweler dead
Even though they talk about me shit I'm used to head

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ra, ra, ra, ra
You hear that chopper well
Its either locked in jail or on the block hot as hell
Frying pan, I'm iron man with the Glock was held
A lot of rocks to sell, back pocket, pocket scale
In my cool jays but I ain't do rock the bells
I'm with a brick squad like that click Waka yell
Just hold you nose if you don’t like that sour smell
I burn my building down, same way the towers fell

[Hook]
