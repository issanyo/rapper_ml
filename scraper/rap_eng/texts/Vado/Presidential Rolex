[Verse 1: Vado]
D-boy, squeezed off
Got my first prezzy the next day bought three more
Sub-mariner, Daytona, them things cost
Yellow green face, I see why Mase breezed off
Tight agressing, my mic obsession
Still a weird boss in the chair like My Conception
Well mannered, held hammers, in the right direction
No wi-fi but need you a plug with the right connection
Condos on both coasts where most toast
You can be broke but you out small like road smoke
Rakim, big gold chains, I'm no joke
Had my album cover with all the hustlers that sold dope
On some real shit, could feel shit
I don't fill shit
Come around, you get them real quick
I'm no one's
Ill with, who conceal bricks
Been had put down the rock/ROC on some Amil shit

[Hook: Vado]
Presidential Rolex
Residential, White House suites
Boutiques is what we're into
Far from mental
Move hard my credentials
Superstar potential
Shoot far that I get you

Y'all ain't getting no money
We've been eating, y'all niggas look hungry
Y'all ain't getting no money
We've been fresh, y'all niggas look bummy

[Verse 2: C Nellz]
Breakfast Club
Off dinner plates
I see it's time for the Rollie and the 10 to 8
Gun in your face, face in your safe
Turn a little robbery into a murder case
I know real killers
No Murder Mase
Rell doing 25 on his third case
Let the oil drop now you serve bass
No white collar, I never learned Chase
Couldn't make bail
I ain't saved a dime
I know crime pays and time pay for crimes
But dead men don't so I gotta stay with mines
Beam in the scope, I spray P-89

[Verse 3: Jae Millz]
He said I know you don't look out for family right?
I turned around and said what family, Ice?
Presidential Rollie wrist pure gold baby
Hand out on these haters like what money, I'm broke baby
Polo down to the underwear
I'm in the two-seater with your woman there
I hit the club like 'Let a nigga get dumb in here'
Pow pow! Man down. No Rihanna here
Summer time we're posted on Lennox
Get the toys, double parked, no rentals
Louis Vuitton sneakers with the spikes on them
Twenty thousand dollar watches, no ice on them
I'm up like the cake's top layer
Your money short, JJ Barea
And raising my level of anger, that's danger
I call all you niggas out like Kramer

[Hook]
