[Intro]
I just need to get this said
With all due respect you've put me down in this game
I didn't ask for that, not even a hand shake
Make me want things, things I could see and I can almost touch
Then you take them away. Not for me right?
Everyone else but not me, I'm what?
A mistake you make? Like some keft overs
And I'm supposed to go through my life
No friendship, no love till I'm pissing in my bed
Coughing the blood on the sheets then I'm alright
Then it will all be clear.Put it in front of me and take it away
Why would you do that, aha
Just to screw with me, what kind of sake fuck thinks that way
I'm supposed to trust you,based on the treatment so far, what do you want?
I'm here, I'm listening, I'm ready for every kind of explanation

[Verse 1]
Uh turn up your stereo but you don't her me though
I'm eating off the O's and the white like Cherios
Hoes been giving me neck, tuh. imperial
I'm lyrical need the miracle disappear and move
Shit is real looking critical
N iggas willplay with your kids just to get rid you
I'm strapped up put some dolo like let me sit with you
I just came home, the streets sayin' I need it get with you,
That's when he said it ain't no recruiting homie,
I got enough, don't need another nigga shooting for me,
That's bout enough, had it up to here niggas up the years
Them numbers fierce on that package, that ain't enough to share
So now I gotta switch up the gears
Up the leer rari's with bucket chairs custom with the wheels
Then give em reason to fucking steal, we all fucking here

[Hook x2]
Nigga when I cry no tear shit, ain't beautiful
Nigga when I ride, no fear, I put the tool in you
Nigga when I die, don't care if it's no funeral
Nigga you alive and you here, God ain't through with you

[Verse 2]
This kid over ten did ten now he home again
Was the mass and rover since had to rolly and rover then
He was my doberman sold the rock more than hova man
Was over when he caught his first body, he ain't been sober since
I let them holder benz, healthy knot and a burner
Front him a half a brick, a whole block and then work em
Told em donâ€™t do shit, just take care of the server
He having this move fist like he don't feel he a earner
Think he a has been when I laugh like ain't you just stacking
Like fuck captain, just fall back and start relaxing
He want the action, squeeze plastic ski masking
Told em don't even ask then, not to see this is passion
Tomorrow early I need you meet up a curly
Curly ran with a birdie and moving like ain't no worries
If you hurry and burry I pay with them things go for
Here's he's key, 804, say no more

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Mansion in Bulvia, stand with the familia
Lamping with a millia, lambobanana interior
Every morning I'm hand in hand in from Silvias
Hammer in my pilly so put some bampers that really up
Like what's the cause? designer clothes
Stuck off my second god father, Hyman Roth
Been on his own, my real father behind them walls
The monologue with with just talking chains like a diamond cross
Hustled at night till I can't stand up
Garage flooded with white like Santanas
We was upping the price till they can't stand us
All our Gucci colors is white can't scam us

[Hook]
