[Hook:]
You know I
Thug 'em
Fuck 'em
Love 'em
Leave 'em
Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em

[Verse1:]
Bug 'em, cuff 'em
Never need 'em
Whatever, you can keep 'em
That be him, in that BM
With your new BM
Man, you can't see him! (Vado!)
I'ma pimp in every sense of the word
Bitch, come and get your girl, bitch
Slime Flu cough on em now the world sick
Go four door, ????
And my missletoe man sporting the portee
250 on the watch, make em nervous
??, What I'm trippin on M's or better
Like the Coupe but the M is better
If she cute, I tends to get her
That's my boo, high heel in the boot and the finty sweater
Chick fly!

[Hook:]
I'ma pimp in every sense of the word
Bitch, come and get your girl, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse2:]
Part with nothing
Sharp and Stuntin
Take G-4 flights to London
Parties happening
Bottles cracking
Then we right back in Manhattan
Every week high fashion
Got that Kanye passion
On that Kanye mad shit
Two hundred on the Dashian (Sliiiime!)
Uh, ill nigga spittin like that
Stop fronting, lil' nigga, you ain't like that
Pull out the tool, that's cool I'll be right back
But you get a call, what to do to get your wife back
Leave every witness
You see us all out to eat it's heavy business
What I seen in the streets you never did this
Beef, I'm at your door like a wreath Merry Christmas

[Hook]

[Verse3:]
You know I bag 'em, wrap 'em, strap 'em, take 'em
Bring it back throw it all on the table
Count it up and take part what I gave you
The other half put part in the label
Yeah, yeah yeah

Rubberbands on, one chain, two gold angels
Might need a home at range across gabel??
