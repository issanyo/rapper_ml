[Verse 1: Vado]
Yea I always been a block nigga
On the mailbox with ma block niggas
Nore on em bikes doing blocks nigga
3 dice on the ground what you got nigga?
And Lee be quick to tell me V you got niggas (all day)
And stay up out them banks, you too hot nigga
Crime Set was getting busy wit em pots nigga
A hundred coming back, twenty get you shot nigga
City of hella raw, we sell it all
Pull up to Delanor in the eleanor
Shawty a hella whore, you better off
And when she mollied up, bet you she gon tell it all
When its feasting, crab house dinner meetings
Bank account full, I'm good I finished eating
Sail boat for the weekend, range rove when I'm jeeping
High profiles, they sending us to the Beacon
But we gon still move the butter though (Slimmme)
Free Gudda yo
I push the button like fuck it though
Just fucked your bitch for bout a hundred [?]
Taking pictures, champagne, spitt cream
Take bitches, let it play on the big screen
Shit mean, was nothing sweet at sixteen
I'm from Harlem, seeing fiends like Mitch Green
Joe Handman heroin dope handed
Coke leaves for lunch, breakfast, pan bandit
Coke grams was us, next we check scanned it
Broke man we up, necklace been dancing magn
Necklace been dancing magn..

[Verse 2: Riq Bubz]
I been hot fucking thoughts its word to my mother
I got a broad that only let me hit her undercovers
I got wit her when I was frontin weed to her brother
Love the nigga thug, so she gave me head to Danny Glover
Check the stats, my team up
They thought Phil was coaching
Fuck wit me and get shot like Ray was open
Crash spots getting raided like a player open
Knock so wild, you fuck around and catch the Mayor toking
I just wanna be heard, no I dont need a grammy
Fuck wit slime you gon see kufi soon in these hella slammys
I got love for all of em shot divider Richard Porter
So let em shine and fifty muslims come and cross the water
Let the gloves on the mouthes of your harvest daughters
No Royce, Em or Joe judging but thats total slaugter
I'm from Jersey so that beef get put on burners
Its off with ya cap for the drop like you Bobby Shmurda
