[Hook: Big L]
I'm large on the street scene
I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene
Cuz I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene
I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene
Every time I touch mics, I'm large on the street scene

[Verse 1]
Heads start bobbing like "who's this?"
Vado that dude spits, sharper than steak knives from Ruth Chris
You hors d'oeuvres get toothpicks, I aim to shoot shit
Sweep up ya whole block; no broomsticks
When I touch mics, I come right
They like "son nice", get thrown like hung Nikes
Every bar's a gun fight, get one strike
Coke like Tiger Woods, fuck with too much white (Haaa!)
Proud dream, my style mean
Wish I was here, see the next thing they crown king (Vado!)
It's that swag that Uptown bring
4 pound swing, you be down before the sound DING!
You ask me, you sound weak, you not a threat
Like Artest I don't stand too far from the best (Killa!)
Carhartt and vest, no I ain't the hardest yet
There's a few artists left, words for them "God Bless"

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Live performance hit the stage no encore
A wild cat that can ball like he John Wall
Get crossed, big cross wearing like John Paul
No Pope, peel dope, got it inside walls
I cop ounces from the Hill
Uptown and down the block from where Malcolm was killed
Street built, could tell the album is real
Numbers could go on heads, thats just how a nigga feel
Tight if you want, you either fight or get jumped
If I was in hell, I'd have Satan light me a blunt
Got a variety, if it ain't the trey, it might be the pump
Dig a hole for all his kids, throw wife in the trunk
Fuck Life, I fear nothing, you nice? Lemme hear something
I'm like a Mack Truck, you a deer running
Straight roadkill, I don't care buzzin, my name in the air buzzin'
Cops floodin' the block like the mayor comin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ten dollar bag is a dime
A bad bitch thats fine
Got work on the strip you grind
See a nigga you say slime (Sliiiime!), locked up you got time
Coke you got lines, deal you got signed
Stop it 5 you all talk, singles we call shorts
And popped off means we all for it
Cotton Club thugs ya'll all soft
Blocks thats boardwalks, shipping you up top that's up North
One time means fuck off
Or say it before you hang up the phone, dap your man then walk off
A hot cars a toy, a cop car's the boys
We call Nike Shox the boings, loose change is coins
Gunplay you shoot things with noise
Say you wearing bang bang means your chain is moist
You like the way I deliver it?
I talk for Harlem, I will never stop kicking it
