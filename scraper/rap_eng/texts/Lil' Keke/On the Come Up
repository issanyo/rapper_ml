(*talking*)
Check the game, we gon do it like this
For the 2 triple 3, alright

[Lil' Keke]
Hold up a minute, and let me mash it
Give me a check, and I'll cash it
It's all about the cream, and getting paid you see
I'm from the fourth largest city, called 7-1-3
This is O Town, where niggas be getting smoked down
Catch me next summer, I'm chilling down in your town
For real, signing a major deal
All I wanna do is relax, and make my mills

[Hook - 2x]
How many niggas, be getting they crush on (crush on)
When the FED's is coming, you get your rush on (rush on)
Life is gravy, I'm on the come up (come up)
If you think it's a game, then go on run up (run up)

[Lil' Keke]
Where them go-getters, not them bullshitters
Talking certified soldiers, them lick hitters
You know every year, we gonna roll new whips
Gangstas, thugs and them Bloods and Crips
We on the bottom, trying to make it to the top
Shaking the FED's, trying watch out for crooked cops
I'm loaded, full of Hen and dank
Going 80 on the freeway, I'm wasting my drank
I need a Hotel, with a woman to match
In a 600 Coupe, when it's time to scratch
So I'm crawling, and the rain is falling
One thing fa sho mayn, forever we balling
We stay fly, and we stay high
Got the answer to the game, like that A.I
It's the come up, so don't run up
And the ki's in the kitchen, man they done up

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
Last but not least, bank accounts increase
Trying to get to the cheese, to my life deceased
On the cool, when it's time to swing
Got them bricks to the ceiling, stand tall as Yao Ming
How you like that, better get back
Stash and put away, for some mo' stacks
This the street game, are you ready my man
Get your bread get your money, get a hell of a plan
Poetic 1, yeah this your nigga Lil' Ke
Avarice representing, with that CMG
We could never stop, with no motherfucking plexes
All respect due, to the city Houston Texas

[Hook - 2x]
