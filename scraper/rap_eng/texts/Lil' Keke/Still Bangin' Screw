[Intro: King Kyle Lee]
Ain't no need for me to act brand new
Yeah I'm still bangin' that Screw
Robert Earl Davis that's my nigga
Still sippin' purp' and blowin' hydro killa

[Hook: King Kyle Lee]
I'm still screwed up in this bitch
Blowin' kush off in this bitch
Sippin' drank off in this bitch
We deep off in this bitch
My G's off in this bitch
We slowmo in this bitch
Your hoe off in this bitch
"Playa's Get Chose" off in this bitch
I'm still bangin' Screw, yee
I'm screwed up, I'm screwed up forever
Said I'd rather bang my screw
Grippin' wood grain in the, in the turning lane

[Verse 1: King Kyle Lee]
Robert Earl Davis was one of the greatest
That's why everything is still screwed in my playlist
I don't care if it's T.I., 2 Chainz or Big Poppa
If it's in my radio it's gon' be screwed and chopped up
Screw head till I'm gone, I'm a screwed up nympho
Dr. Dre and my swisha sweet, cup full of that Big Moe
Ridin' Dirty like Pimp C, Big Pimpin' like Bun B
S.U.C. my family, missin' Big H.A.W.K. and that P-A-T

[Hook: King Kyle Lee]
I'm still screwed up in this bitch
Blowin' kush off in this bitch
Sippin' drank off in this bitch

"Playa's Get Chose" off in this bitch
I'm still bangin' Screw, yee
I'm screwed up, I'm screwed up forever
Said I'd rather bang my screw
Grippin' wood grain in the, in the turning lane

[Verse 2: Lil Keke]
Slow it down then take flight, them grey tapes my life
Cause I'd rather bang my screw, [?]
Mix it up and then chop it down cause them Texas boys so true
When I roll up they just hold up, cause I kill the streets when I do
Kush bud and I'm free, might be jammin' on some Kyle Lee
Yeah I'm screwed up, I'm OG, also known as Mr. Don Ke
Got my homies still on my mind, got that Pat still in my grind
Got that Moe all in my cup with that loud pack and I'm flyin'
Been here and I'm rich, real nigga - didn't switch
Yeah we showed up in this bitch then we poe'd up in this bitch
Don't matter, niggas gon' hate, but I'd rather bang that tape
Cause I'm born here and I'm sworn here and I'm still reppin' my state

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
I'm screwed up till I'm in my grave and glued up in my cup (my cup)
Screw love all across the globe got the whole world screwed up (screwed up)
I'm on 71 on the way to Smithfield
Cup don't spill got [?]
Wood grain wheel with a woman and grill
Gotta pop my trunk for the land of the trill
P-A-T to the A-T-X [?]
Same time all the way down to the valley, get to the money
Everybody want a [?]
1 deep in a four door 'Lac, buy new shoes
Me and Pimp C, I drank it too
Drop my top to enjoy the view
And I only bangin' loud and, and screwed
Paul Wall baby..

Your chick wanna get close to me
I'm cuffin' the doja sweet
When it's on [?]
I'm the black Howard Stern
Now watch me do a Y-turn (swerve, skrrrrt)
Don't make me put this FNT in side burn
When Screw crowned me as a king it made my name legendary
This screwed up shit is in my blood I swear this shit hereditary
I did 3 Screw tapes but 1 got lost
I miss that Fat Pat, Big Moe and H.A.W.K
I mix Hi-Tech with Actavis, it's the white cup gang
We got hats and shit
When I ride out my cup full, my clip full, my tank full
There's red bottoms on my shoes and Kyle Lee that's my dude
Salute..
