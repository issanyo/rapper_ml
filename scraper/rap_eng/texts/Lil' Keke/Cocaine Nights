[Hook]
Bona fide hustler, certified G
I don't do this shit for haters, I just do this shit for me
Comma, zero, zero, comma
We live for them cocaine nights and good summers
I'm a bona fide gangster, certified thug
I don't do this shit for haters, I just do this shit for love
Comma, zero, zero, comma
We live for them cocaine nights and good summers

[Verse 1]
They said they hating on a don, of course they are
I'm supposed to shine all the time, I'm a rising star
Hood rich, upgraded my bitch, we getting bread
She fast to the money, and slow to the head
The fire still breath within, here to win
On point like your favorite pen, so come again
Bona fide gangster, certified thug
Homages being paid, fuck who these bitches love
I'm a hustler, fix it and get it in broad day
Don Ke' I suffered and did it the hard way
We eat real good so we doubled the profit
I'm talking zero's, comma's, safe, deposit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm hungry for greatness, appetite for doing better
I got an eye for this money, a feel for good weather
Jacker's wear concrete shoes, so come test us
Go to bed starving, and get paid for breakfast
In the kitchen, turn off the stove and clean the dishes
Nigga you can stay out of mine, don't sleep with fishes
Desperate for them cocaine numbers and good summers
Nigga's say they want what we got, well take it from us
Bird game it's all official, so make the purchase
Soon as them fool's play games, just put the hearse's
Bare skin covered in dirt with no shirt
And these by standards will get hurt for more work

[Hook]
