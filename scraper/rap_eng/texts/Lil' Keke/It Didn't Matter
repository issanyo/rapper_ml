[Intro: Lil Keke]
You gotta do it yourself
Do it homie, do it yourself
Do it, do it yourself
If you wanna get dealt, do it yourself

[Verse 1: Lil Keke]
Just cause we come up from the bottom, that didn't matter to me
I'm just a hard headed nigga, I'm so blessed to be free
You know the streets forever hungry they can't eat you alive
My big homie did eight flat then came home and die
You got some niggas here stuck in the past, can't last
Steady creepin' with his pistol and mask, he finna crash
Yeah my partner made parole today
Fuck what he done, he back home and he comin' to stay
Dear lord, does it matter I been thuggin' for life
Do I deserve this pickin' fist with the kids and wife
I told myself that you look better from the top of the hill
Plus I'm a 100 still hustlin', outhere gettin' it for real
But watch your step and just be careful, life will change on ya
If you slippin' happen quick and leave a stain on ya
I maintain on them, cause pride is kept
It don't matter we just love it to death

[Hook: Lil Keke]
When everythang was lookin' bad on the corner and it wasn't so good
It didn't matter we kept repping the hood
It's understood if I lost all I had and the hate didn't stop
It don't matter I still repped my block
I told my homies when the laws had us runnin', steady duckin' the heat
It didn't matter we just stuck to the street
We used to ride and we grind all night, didn't get no bigger
It didn't matter I still love my nigga

[Verse 2: Lil Keke]
I told my brother we can hustle til the casket close
From this rat infested gutter til I sold our shows and I suppose
On the real I didn't matter to me
That's how it be
God bless 'em if they lookin' for free
I'm just a G O yeah my trill nigga love my dawg
That's if he 20 dimes of square feet or a hole in the wall
I got your back, it's just don't matter we was raised like that
That's if they lock us up and white try to embarassing black
Just look for Don Ke to stand up to speak that trill
Quit ridin' dick and get your chick or she might get it forreal
It's 7-13 comin' on the front of the bus
We still together motherfucker it didn't matter to us
I got my mind right and closed up the rest of the scene
I told Dash we can get it with a fresh new team, I see the dream
Jabbar got us broke, I'm brangin' it home this for Poochie, Pokey and my kinfolk Tone

[Hook: Lil Keke]
When everythang was lookin' bad on the corner and it wasn't so good
It didn't matter we kept repping the hood
It's understood if I lost all I had and the hate didn't stop
It don't matter I still repped my block
I told my homies when the laws had us runnin', steady duckin' the heat
It didn't matter we just stuck to the street
We used lying and we cryin' all night, didn't get no bigger
It didn't matter I still love my nigga

[Outro: Lil Keke]
You gotta do it yourself
Do it homie, do it yourself
Do it, do it yourself
If you wanna get dealt, do it yourself
