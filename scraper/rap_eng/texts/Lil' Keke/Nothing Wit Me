I'm a pimp by nature, and a boss by force

A lot of niggas in the streets, say they hood as me
But on the microphone rapping, not as good as me
I'm on the grind going hard, and my pen is hot

Niggas calling out my crew, like my click gon fold
But we gon strap 'em to the track, and let the c-train roll
I'm a Custom Made Gangsta, and a Capo too

And I'm headed to the top, but still seeking revenge yeah

Fuck the background, man my turn is next
Tell them folks in New York, to start cutting the check
Niggas whispering under the rug, that I'm lost and forgot
But on the cool damn fool, check the radar watch
All these kings everywhere, I refuse to kneel

These mark niggas rapping, I'ma spit in they face
Put the garbage in the dump, and put the trash in the waste
These FED's is moving close, it's getting scary
The next thing you see, is plenty kites and commissary
These streets are necessary, they made me legendary
Rock solid game, got the frame sitting heavy
Niggas think it's gravy, but we float like the Navy
Laid back like a pimp, and let the microphone pay me
A different color creed, got different color weed
A Custom Made Gangsta, from a different kind of breed
Niggas probably bleed, if they testing my round
And niggas can get it quick, on my side of the town
These niggas is rat-packing, they ain't fucking with Ke'
Chit-chatting in the back, but they don't want it with me yeah
