H-Town, in effect for Texas
Southside, for the H-Town
Northside, for the H-Town
Eastside, for the H-Town
Westside, for the H-Town

It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
All these playas comin' up out that H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know we bout to climb
All these ballers representin' that damn H-Town

Blaze up the indo, light the chocolate tye
Sittin' on South Race screens, ballin' out the sky
Hoes diss that ass cause they wanna buy me Ralph Lauren
Cause big 'o 19's look lovely on the foreign
I ain't borrowing, the baddest, the V-12 is the baddest
A rhymin' apparatus gave me superstar status
Longers get my list, haters got me pissed
I used to sell rocks, now they all on my wrist
Feel this before yourself, step and get in this
The playa, the pimp, young thug and a menace
Pretendness is endless, and crank up confusion
Yo sweet gal is choosin knockin' out Houston

It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
All these playas comin' up out that H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know we bout to climb
All these ballers representin' that damn H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
Throw your hands in the air for that H-Town
It's goin' down, and they can't really see
Screwed-Up Click for life, this is Little Keke

Two, is ballin' in the mix
And hit me on the beep if you need thirty-six
Quickly, we get the grams on the pyrexes
I'll make you mighty reckless to run up on the Lexus
It's still this game from a Southern gangbanger
No anger to a stranger, but it's one up in the chamber
Of the blared straight Glock cause haters come in flocks
It don't face born and raised on the 8100 block of Herschelwood
And the point is understood
We keep it all good in this crack-controlled hood
It ain't too late to set it straight, real players don't hate
Push weight and keep fate and the money that I make I'ma break
500 mean gold, tapes sold, story told, from the North to South Pole
21 years old, wanna bone, won't drown
Just another pimp comin' out that H-Town

It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
All these playas comin' up out that H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know we bout to climb
All these ballers representin' that damn H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
Throw your hands in the air for that H-Town
It's goin' down, and they can't really see
Southside representin' and this is Little Keke

Verse three, who it be, L-i-l K-e
That's me, I'm a g, from the southside of the T
You and me, baby, let's get a room for the hour
Get high as a tower, bust a nut and hit the showers
Get gone with the wind, after while it's on again
This time bring a friend, a couple corners we gone bend
Let's pretend that this sin, ain't even been committed
Once I split it then I hit it, you in love, go'on admit it
It's goin' down, yeah I'm talking to you
H-Town, smoked out jammin' Screw
Tell your crew it's '97, it ain't no refusin'
We got 'em to the bottom now they all lovin' Houston

It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
All these playas comin' up out that H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know we bout to climb
All these ballers representin' that damn H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
Throw your hands in the air for that H-Town
It's goin' down, and they can't really see
Herschelwood my hood, this is Little Keke

Reporter:
"Keke you sure have been the Cinderella story
You've been shooting to the top of the billboard, but
How do you feel about the East Coast West Coast situation?"

Lil' Keke:
"You know, I'ma keep my comments about that, but
Due to representation, it's Something About The Southside"
