Watchin the earth turn feelin the world spin

Cuttin cause I swear that this game ain't gon'
Promise you nothin its a circumstance that we
All go through some things is fake nigga somethings
True I reconize that I've been down forever
Time to pull the family up and try to do it together
I got no where to run and no where to hide
My false is my worst so I'm stuck with pride
Cause the women and the cars it dont equal the wealth
So I'm all about my cash tryna impress myself
Cause the man make the money-money dont make the man
If you feel what I'm sayin then raise your right hand!
