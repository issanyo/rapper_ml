[Intro:]
This goes out to all the hustlin niggas
Who get up and get it everyday
258365, let’s get it
713, Young gun in here
I say hustle USA
I say hustle USA
Turn it up one time

[Chorus:]
I pull up in that new coop
Subtract a top
And I pull off with your new boo
Subtract a top
And I’m ridin aroun and I’m gettin it nigga
And I don’t have to stop
And my rolex watch don’t tick nigga
It’s a magic box
Got ten K in my duffle bag
I got em real confused
So I hit the club and I make it rain
I got nothin to lose
Spit five K on this diamond chain
I got somethin to prove
It might not be nothin to me
But it’s somethin to you

[Verse 1:]
Hey guess who’s back Young Don
Trick ass niggas I don’t want none
I ain’t neva left cause I stayed here
And I’m bagged up and I’m on one
Stand up tall for that south side
Broke ass niggas they mouth quiet
My chain thick and my rolly sick
And I love the that way my coop drive
Niggas know that I’m gettin mine
Lights off and my click shine
My gwap good and my block good
And we hit this bitch at the right time
Subtract a top
I like a blow that’s strong
Pull up nice and your boo she gone
She call back cause I’mma throw them stacks
And I’mma pick her up
And I’mma fuck her long
Subtract a top
Then I cash out till I pass out
My dream there, my team here
And the rest a you niggas just [?]
Rep my hood when we on stage
We gettin rich and we gettin paid
So I told my homies just stand up
Cause we can blow this bitch like the world trade

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
On top I don’t need no
Introduction niggas
Keep fuckin roun you gon bleed hoe
Repercussion nigga
[?] are well trained
Like the army nigga
It’s goin down like the world trade
No [?] nigga
I’m overseas where the cameras at
In my dungarees
I keep plenty green, no cabbage patch
I got luck indeed
She gon fuck with me
Then you can have back
I got a bunch a G’s
And I’m selling keys, no catillac
I hear the phone ringin
I got four ring on my right hand
I’m blowin green
And I’m pourin lean in my sprite can
Before I go to sleep
I make sure the [?] on the night stand
That AK 47
My hype man
You can lose your life man

[Chorus]
