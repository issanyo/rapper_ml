[Intro]
Rep your hood, (do what)
Rep your hood (do what), rep your hood
For my G's and my thugs, my niggas rep your hood (do what)
Rep your hood (do what), rep your hood
For my G's and my thugs, my niggas rep your hood (do what)
Rep your hood (do what), rep your hood (do what)

Rep your hood (do what), rep your hood

[Lil' Keke]
I bet ya y'all came here, to rock the club
It ain't no way, that these haters can stop the club
I see some independent women, I see some thugs
So get your bounce on whodie, and show some love
This the club homie, you take it home if you're tired
The beat shaking the wall, this party is getting live
This the club homie, you take it home if you're tired
She shaking and acting bad, that ass is getting wide
Cause uh we came here, to crank it up
Be a star hit the bar, and drink it up
Now tell em we came here, to crank it up
And ya know that this click, don't give a fuck
So get your roll on homie, and rock the club
We in the VIP, we stank it up
So get your roll on homie, and rock the club
S.U.C. in the building, show us love

[Hook]
So get your back up off the wall, do what ya do
Get your pimp game on for real, now what it do
Already down here fa sho, do what ya do

Sets up in the sky, we repping it for the hood what it do

[Big Pokey]
I picked the lock, and came through

Five pound VS1's, done came blue
In my ear lobes fist, wrists and chain too
Dog I know a hundred thangs, that a dame do
Let her do what she do daddy, just don't let her change you
In the club VIP, pulling the Range through
Tipping hundreds dropping money, some niggas can't do
What it do, we fall in the club it's going down
VIP broked off, nigga we blowing pine
