(*talking*)
Uh uh, get your mind right (get your mind right)
What Southsi' for li', West Coast nigga fell it uh

[Chorus]
Coming straight from the heart, cause I got nothing but love
Man it really hurt, cause we done lost another thug
Coming straight from the heart, cause I got nothing but love
Man it really hurt, cause we done lost another thug
Would you ride for your dog, would you die for your dog
Staying side by side, prepare to lose it all
Would you ride for your dog, would you die for your dog
Staying side by side, prepare to lose it all

[Lil' Keke]
I'm living life on the run, this is hot pursuit
Nigga lying homies dying, better strap on your boots
I'm the Young Don, you know I do what I do
One of the first ones in the click, since the year 9-2
Now me and Screw, the click you know we started that
It was a three headed monster, with my boy Fat Pat
We was the thoedest, the coldest on this side of town
And all them rookies speaking up, you know they had to bow down
We was profiling freestyling, buck wilding
Making money, had a playa smiling
Keeping it crunk bringing the funk, popping the trunk
Smoking the skunk, a playa don't front
'Fore I lay down to sleep, you know I got's to pray
Cause this life ain't been the same, since we lost P-A
Sometimes I pick it up, just to make a call
Cause my right hand to God, man I miss my dog uh

[Chorus]
[Lil' Keke]
We was swanging swoop, in a brand new coupe
This Commission Music Group, we hotter than chicken soup
Would you kill for your homie, would you steal for your homie
Be ready to bust a shot, when they try to run up on me
Would you ride for a thug, would you die for a thug
Be ready to pump a slug, would you see a nigga blood
H-Town to Oakland, the highway smoking
Puffing on some'ing green, that'll bust your chest open
Or trip in the zone, for my homies that's gone
DJ Screw you the king baby, sit on that throne
Mafio Big Steve, don't worry I got it rocking
Just for P-A-T, I'ma keep a top dropping
Long live the name, forever in the game
Letting you boys know, until you feel my pain
Southside for life, baby a playa got pride
East to West Coast, real dogs gon' ride

[Chorus]
[Lil' Keke]
Pressure bust the pipes, so that's what I like
Had to master the game, like it's riding a bike
I lost some people man, you know this world is a trip
It got me paranoid, riding with a Glock and a clip
I know a lot of people saying, you the last one left
That's why I'm studio bound, keeping some'ing on the shelf
I mash on the gas, with no time to play
Me Pokey and Corleone, plus the H-A-W-K
Tell Poetic just don't sweat it, I'ma drop him a hit
Do it straight from the heart, because I love the click
I got the heart of a hustler, the mind of a G
Dedicating this song, to Screw and P-A-T
I'ma hold it down, until I make it that way
On the last 16, with so much to say
No giving up, this is life on the run
All respect due, from Lil' Keke the Don what

[Chorus]
