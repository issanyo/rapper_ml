[Hook]
Something about the Southside
That makes me wanna act bad
[?]
Flossing my candy slab

[Verse 1: Mr. 3-2]
[?] mastermind, aggravated with heat, blazin a sweet
Sippin' surp and the wine is cheap
The game is deep, but I can't say the game don't pay
You better buy some property and put your money away
I ball every day [?]
And come through my hood in brand new [?]
To each his own, the foolest 3 to the 2
Keeping it true and gone off a stick of [?]
Player made to the fullest [?], not really ain't trippin'
Cause everybody know I got that low-low on the chickens
Living lavish, having cabbage with love world wide
Just some about the Southside that keep me crunk inside, nigga
