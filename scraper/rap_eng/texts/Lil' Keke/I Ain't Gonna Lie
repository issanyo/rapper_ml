Let me tell you a story, bout this chick I know
Think I met lil' mama, couple of months ago
Had a bright complexion, a nice lil' chick
Bout 135, stood about 5"6'
Ok I stepped to her, I know I really wanna do her
But I'ma check her out, before the Don try to screw her
She jazzy, she got the walk and talk
Tell a straight faced lie mayn, without getting caught
Ok just peep game, she thought she had a playa lame
Tried to play a nigga close, tried to hustle my fame
I took a closer look, it;s time to hold up and stop
Wanna eat ball and shop, but then play with the cock what

I ain't gon lie man, these hoes a trip
On the real mayn, these hoes a trip look
That's right come on, come on
That's right, come on

[Lil' Keke]
Now check this other broad, it ain't no sense in being fraud
This young lady was hard, had to give her her card
On the first date, she was talking bout now
Trying to get some cheap prices, on a brick and a half
She was airplane slow train, cocaine getter
Invited me to the crib, so I passed by and hit her
She checked out decked out, shit up in line
Two story travel garage, this bitch on the grind
Bout three months done passed, and now she say she love me
Gave her a few bricks, she hit some quick stangs for me
Sophisticated hood bitch, like none other
So never judge a book, by it's motherfucking cover what

[Hook]
I ain't gon lie man, these hoes a trip come on
Check the status man, these hoes a trip what
Here we go now, here we go
Yeah here we go now, what

[Lil' Keke]
I got this other freak, thick hips and thighs
She's a head hunting soldier, with no surprise
Get her cash on, cause her parents use to spoil her
Love rubbing my body, like massage parlor
When I'm all in her world, she say daddy I feel ya
Sex and round ass, you know that thong material
Out the suburbs, but she bubble her herb
Down to get it busy, on the side of the curb
She's a city slicker, and she steady getting thicker
The kind on the grind, gotta have the money quicker
Off the rip, you know she looking for a tip
I swear on my life mayn, these hoes a trip what

[Hook]
I ain't gon lie mayn, these hoes a trip come on
Check the status mayn, these hoes a trip what
Here we go now, here we go
Yeah here we go now, what
