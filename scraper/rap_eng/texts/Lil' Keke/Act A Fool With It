[Intro]
That's right
713
You know hits, heavy in the streets nigga you know what it is check it out
[Verse 1: Lil Keke]
Street game major, a killer institution
Go get if you want it that's my gangsta revolution
I'm from Houston got stars on my brim
And a Bentley with the same color rims on slims
Mash that's all a real G ever hear
Get your paper right now and be through with last year
Twist your fingers up if ya bout that there
If it ain't presidential don't like that square
When the rag top lay its maroon and grey
Summertime on the way im gettin money today
Move for the money
Scared stay home
Fairies got bread on the phone im gone
You still moving rocks and stated the last stone
In the kitchen with the pot and then whip up another zone
Stared independent took it to the limit
I got a boat load of cash I'm act a fool wit it
[Hook]
I gotta move for the money
Bounce for the bread
Go get it if you want it
Go to church if your scared
Act a fool with it
Hey hey, I act a fool with it
These haters can't tell me nothin
So I move for the money
Bounce for the bread
Go get it if you want if
Go to church if your scared
Act a fool with it
Hey hey, I act act fool with it
These haters can't tell me nothin
[Verse 2]
If the money's out a bounds then I will skip town
Ain't no stoppin lil ke when he makin his rounds
Planes vans interstate runnins
If the deal is complete than nigga we sure comin
Cake I'm bout it
Bread I'm bout it
Got a nice thick wallet and a fresh fat pocket
You want it we got it if the price is fair
It's gon be a little more if im bringin' it there
I'm ridin' with a rocket jackers can't stop it
Solid clientele make a hellified profit
Shades by Corvallis Jeans cost a stack
Prada shoes and a belt that's a whole nother rack
I ain't superstitions
But the truck so vicious
From the south we love cars big money bad bitches
It's all about the benjamins simple as that
If the cash ain't here then i go where it's at
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Coward ass niggas just look at em' run
Stick a fork in them pussy ass niggas cuz' they done
Talk ya ass off just don't get outta line
If these suckas play games shit somebody dyin'
Dirty south still here you can kill that bull
Everybody gon' eat like ace in paid in full
Hotter than the sun
Silver coupe on the runs
The money monopolize now im settin up my sons
When yall' lay down im gon call them ones
You gon' think its New Years when we bust them guns
Move for the money
Get cash when you want it
When it's yo time to shine homie seize that moment

[Hook]
