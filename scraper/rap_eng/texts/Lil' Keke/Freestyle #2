And my gun I'm not the one, I got a son

Hoes on my dick, popping up like a switch blade

And you know it's all good, take it back to the hood
If these niggas talking down, I bust em in they face
I wouldn't give a damn, I keep the Glock on my waist
I place em on the ground, it be under place
It's the Young Don, bout to give a nigga taste
