[Verse 1: Lil' Keke]

Lord have mercy momma done raised a real thug
Me and my daddy cool but he showed me tough love
Fifteen I was asked out getting grown
By this time my old man had just moved on
Momma couldn't drive so she didn't have a car
And I could still see my T-lady walking' far
Sweat on her face, purse and a grocery bag
Me and my sister shit that's all we ever had
Stuck my chest out became the man of the house
Now I'm the bread winner, go get it at any cost
Flipping burgers, washing cars, and cutting yards
I graduated to cooking soft and selling hard
High school is over with I'm on a path
To more hoes more dough and a new slab
Ima B.G hard headed so fly
But ma gangsta and like this till I die
(Know what I'm saying)

[Verse 2: Birdman]

I say my hood is a mess the O.G's done got dressed wit the red
They heard the Lil' homie got wet
So them AK's spraying blood for the young blood
You know us nigga is riding us
We fly 25's on them new trucks
We high till we die you can't see us
G for buring purple bush on that kush
Leanin on the lean and them guns stay took
Stunting on them bitches in god we trust
I'll ink my whole body I don't give a mother fuck
Redid the new grill iced out block cuts
Like father like son real niggas stand up
I'm wall paper dog I hustle in the fall
Slept with the gater roll wit guerillas
Built real niggas, a cash money nigga
Young money nigga we them real go gettas
(Belive that)

[Verse 3: Lil' Keke]

Fuck a diploma I'm smuthered in the dro aroma
Still on probation if I piss then Ima gonna
Catch a pistol case for I leave it at the crib
Welcome to hershalwood soldiers get it how they live
A million blocks but they all end at one road
The streets a motherfucker ride till the car explode
Niggas lose your vests I'm taking head shots
Fuck a new story evidence and sub blocks
Pressure bust a pipe kept it real and stayed at it
Them old snitch niggas know the game and still ratted
I'm at the weed house wit 20 bags and 3 for ten
I had a closed mind I wasn't listening back then
Stuck in one spot trying to learn to manage money
Fuck them air Jordans the sky ain't forever sunny
Keep a full clip jackers might wanna visit
Ima G chasing down the same meal ticket
(Know what I'm sayin)(Thats right)

[Hook 5:]

Gots to be a G till the day that I die
Gots to be a G till the day that I die (Real talk)
Gots to be a G till the day that I die
Gots to be a G till the day that I die

Gots to be a G (Crones da bricks nigga)
Gots to be a G (I come from nothing)(hahaaaaa)
Gots to be a G till the day that I die
