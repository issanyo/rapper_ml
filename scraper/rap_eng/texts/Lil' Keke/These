[Intro:]
These boys ain’t gave me nothin
These haters ain’t gave me nothin
These haters ain’t gave me nothin
All this money, I got it from hustlin

[Chorus:]
These haters ain’t gave me nothin, ain’t gave me nothin
I say these haters ain’t gave me nothin, ain’t gave me nothin
These haters ain’t gave me nothin, ain’t gave me nothin
All this money, I got it from hustlin
Hold up [x2]

[Verse 1:]
Ain’t none a these haters neva gave us shit
Still gotta hustle for the shit we get
Bounce back quick for the licks we hit
Two night pass in the same outfit
I rap the type cause this cheque was right
I gotta get this cake and I’m gone
Yea, what they cryin bout
They neva helped us out
Now they hate the fact that we on
Say I’m in the coupe today and in a Houston way
I like to represent for my state (south side)
Yea a nigga extra clean, 13 to 10
And you can bet the shoes from my bed
Cause I like to work for mine when them punks is cryin
I neva gave a damn what they said
Ya’ll niggas gave me nothin
They just say I wouldn’t, but I still be chasin that bread
Nothin but hungry thoughts in my head
Ya’ll can’t feel the shit, cause ya’ll scared
RIP dem niggas that dead
Don’t say shit dem niggas that fed
We went rock for rock until the block was hot
But now we pop the top and get thug
It’s that Texas G and that youngster B
We like to talk the shit cause we go
Gat!
Ok, let’s ride

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
These niggas ain’t gave me nothin
Speak up dog, was you sayin somethin
Bad bitch look like Lisa Rey
The only difference is she in her early twenties
And I pull up in da benz like Snoop
With my hand up her skirt
Fittin make her go to work
But she say it’s too big
Fittin to make this shit work
Pop before a pimp do it
Girl gon go to work
I swear these broke niggas can’t relate to it
That’s why they always bring hate to it
Cause they don’t wanna see a nigga on
Right now i’m in grind mode and I’m gettin to it
No 2 chains but I’m gettin to it
Kill beast like it was nothin to it
If rappin looked like your only way
You mean to tell me you wouldn’t fuckin do it
I’m in the box whip
Like a nose jack
And I get more hate let alone more stack
Don’t talk no shit cause my goons so strapped
Got a tech in the club
Sluggin in from the back
I swear these ho niggas don’t want none
Broke boys they ain’t gave ahit
But now they see e with don Ke
And now they wanna get a verse quick
But ah!!
Ok, let go

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Turn up one time
These niggas ain’t gave me nothin
All this money, I got it from hustlin
