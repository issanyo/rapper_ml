[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Now welcome to the city of game, piece of chains and swangs
Pop, trunk and bang, yeah I'm still here mayne
Born and raised on the stead block, braids no dreadlocks
Married to the hood, me and Scenic Woods wedlock
Acres Homes my home, I'm a Northside veteran
Repping H-Town, smoking, sipping on some medicine
Ain't nobody better than the boss when I floss
It's Slim Thugga motherfucker, still breaking boys off

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Got plenty cheese plenty carats man we looking like some caterers
And it's looking like you haters and you fakes is imitating us
Shaded up, braided up, and I bet that truck be bladed up
Bentley still crawling on fo's so they ain't fading us
In the hood I'm a grinder, wood on the vinyl
TV, VCR, I'm laid back with your mama
You ain't never seen a grinder that grind the way I grind, huh?
Top of my drop still missin' as Osama

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Candy painted with the gloss
You can hate but that's the way a player floss
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Getting money's what I'm bout
I'ma get it while these haters just talk
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Gotta do it for the north
Gotta do it for my hustlers in the south
(Still breaking boys off, boys off, still breaking boys off)
And when I do it I'ma do it like a boss (still breaking boys off)

[Verse 3: Mike Jones]
I still represent H-Town, the city of that candy
They see me with a lotta cars but they don't understand it
They say the never seen ya boy out here gettin his grind on
Phantom, Bentley, take ya pick, yeah I'm gettin' my shine on
I've sold 2 million records now my paper all swole now
The mayor of the city, top down when I roll now
H-town, home of the candy paint
Home of the 84's and vogues and the purple drank

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Yeh this the city that's slow, the city thats thowed
The city where the boys flip the candy painted low
The city where they blow big killa and stayed blowed
Hustling ass D-boys got the game sewed
And sip that paint (sip that paint) and drip that paint (drip that paint)
And drop that top (drop that top) and grip that grain (hold up)
6-10, I-10, 59, 45, and da belt
This Clutch City but we play what we delt
Reppin the H-Town

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Paul Wall]
Hustle town's my home, it's where I do my dirt
Where the gangtstas smoke water with drank stains on they shirt
We ride swangin', chops blades just to break boys off
From South Park to the Southwest and all the way to that north
I'm talking Tidwell and Carverdale and Greenspoint too
From Denver Harbor to West Airport and all the way to Channelview
We steady bangin on this screw, it's chopping like kung fu
Hit me on the 8-3-2, it's Paul Wall wat it do baby

[Verse 6: Yung Redd]
(Heheh, nahmtawkinbout?)
Purple so muddy I can barely even drive
Stay blowin down trees like a Category 5
Southside of H-Town the heart of Sunny Side
I could walk these streets if I was blind, nahmtawkinbout?
Yung Reedd, take ya out the future
Stars imitate swear to God I was a jewler
Robert Davis, Fat Pat, this for you
To my homie Big Hawk, I salute
MAYNE

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Lil Keke]
H-O to the U-S, T-O to the N
God blessed me with the million dollar pen
See them quiet money gangstas with they hand in the air
That Sunny Side and South Park, I was raised out there
This is H-Town (H-Town), screwed up and slowed down
It's all love homie, keep rollin' up the whole pound
Pull up in the monster just look at him hidin'
Don Ke' heart of the south, slab ridin'

[Verse 8: Z-Ro]
H-O-U-S-T-O-N, T-E-X-A-S
We go get it and come back with it until we take our last breath
From the city where our stadiums drop the top
Z-Ro the Crooked, my ghetto pass is good in any hood, any block they got
The white cup is for the codeine and the cigarillo is for the kush
If you want it we got it cause there's not a product we dont push
We used to be the dirty south, now we so dirty we filthy
So homie you must be touching it wrong if you don't feel me (you don't feel me)

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Mike D]
Welcome to H-Town, this 3rd Ward talking
Coming down the slab line the fo's crip walking
Together we stand, divided we fall, yeah
North and the south together we ball
Fuck that, nigga its a H-Town thang
Lemme see ya touch the sky if ya feeling me mayne
Its Boss Hogg Corleone, nigga that Mike D
The drank man daddy, you know where to find me

[Verse 10: Big Pokey]
State to state dawg, I got em jockin the kid
6' backin out the driveway, dropping the wig
Yall know we do it big, like a freightliner rig
Got stashes full of cash where I keep the money hid
Fresh to death homie, how I came in the do'
Prada shades on, smelling like a swanger of dro
Put'cha H'es up, represent'cha city bro
Counting money, iced out, like I'm in a video

[Hook]

[Verse 11: Rob G]
(Talking) Southwest put'cha dubs up baby, let's go!
Now welcome to the place I love, place I was raised to be a G
It's straight hang with thugs, jam my music slow and hold my H's up
Southwest SWAT I know the real dudes that move birdies
I go to school early, baby blue Moon jersey
Riding around, southwest side of my towm
Still Reppin' My Block, How Ya Likin Me Now
Its from Sharpstown, Braeswood to Alief
Black and Latins stacking paper together we stay deep
It's Rob G!

[Verse 12: Trae]
Cheyah!
King of the Streets and I'm roll around Houston ridin 4's
Boys better chill 'fore this throw-away leave they curtains closed (lights out)
I'm in the slab but I'm tippin it like a platinum Rolls
Suicide make the door presidential when they decide to close (real talk)
They want the throne but tell the haters that I got it locked (got it locked)
I shoot em on the west so whatever all they way to the block (doors up)
I'm so hood it be the true definition of me
Ain't no way speak about the H, without mentioning me
Tha Truth, nigga!

[Hook]

[Verse 13: Lil O]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ay I'm from H-Town, southwest stop drop and roll
If I chunk the dub up, the whole hood rock n roll
Braaeswood, Woolfair, Clull Creek, Spice Lane
West Bellville, Fondren Airport, Sandpiper, stack change
I'm so H-Town there's codeine in my blood
And I done shout it out at war with with the meanest of thugs
And you ain't never gotta ask if there's lean in my cup
I'm a triple O.G., S.U.C. nigga what
Its Lil O Homie

[Verse 14: Pimp C]
Now I'm from Port Arthur, Texas, 90 miles away
For the last 15 years, I been reppin my state
I knew the real DJ Screw sip grape by the case
Eight's over ice straight product of the H
Southside, I never was no big socializer
With Bun you can talk, I fuck with the boss
Like Thug and Prince Silvia Rome or Wrice
This game a pie I dont want it all I just need a slice

[Hook]
