[Hook]
Real nigga's keep it real, yeah we keep it real
Trill nigga's keep it trill, yeah we keep it trill
Real bitches keep it real, yeah they keep it real
Trill bitches keep it trill, yeah they keep it trill
Sip somethin', smoke somethin', count it up, count it up
Sip somethin', smoke somethin', count it up
Real nigga's keep it real, yeah we keep it real
Trill nigga's keep it trill, yeah we keep it trill

[Verse 1]
I keep it real, I keep it trill
Real nigga's keep it real, nigga's know the deal
I be knocking down these hoes, call me Holy Phil
Ain't no killer but they with me, and they know who to kill
I'm so for real, two cups
Blow it down, screw it up
Screw it up, screw it up, screw it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it up, count it up
I stay on my grind, bitch I'm getting paid
Fuck with real nigga's, bitch I got it made
All my thug's like Slim, pimp's like C
Trill Bun B, my dogs like Slick, rest in peace

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm so hood rich, packing my steel bitch
I'm on some legendary Houston, Texas trill shit
I'm trying to shuffle bucks, holding my double cup
I'm out here multiplying, add mine and count it up
Oh yeah I'm sipping somethin', burning gas and feeling good
Keep me a real bitch, who know the game and keep it hood
Don Ke' I'm on some street shit, but player made
Hustle hard I'm bout my grinding, and never underpaid
These goons out the cage, gorilla's running round
This south side nigga, tell them haters hold it down
Texas boy, born and raised what they talking bout
Trill niggas, real niggas, this the anthem now

[Hook]
