[Verse 1:]
I’m in dat winning circle
No squares allowed in
And all you hater that ain’t feeling good, call in
Houston my home nigga
Rep every zone nigga
We hit the nicks
And build dem bricks
Straight up from stone nigga
Fifteen strong now it’s on
Yes I’m a OG
Fuck what they saying
Understand these niggas know ke
Lord bless a true thug
Back at it new blood
Still fuck with my blood
That’s on everything I love
Oh yea my [?], we killin
Sacked up, keep spinnin
Talking red carpet, white linen
Yea, my whole circle we winnin
So, I don’t care what they stay
Stay da fuck up out my way
Cause, we don’t fuck with niggas
And that’s on everything a nigga love

[Chorus:]
If we don’t fuck around, don’t fuck around
If we don’t fuck aroun
Then stay da fuck from round mi
I’m in that winnin circle
Bad bitches round mi
I ain't neva gave a fuck bout what they say bout me [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Fuck what they say about us
Neva mind the fine print
This blessin heaven sent
It’s just a testament
This here is plane Jane
We ain’t da same thang
I’m out your league homie
Switch your speed and change lane
Da bright lights near
Da cheque must clear
Race after paper
Chase after bitches, it’s a nice year
High as da nosebleed
Smokin da pros weed
No time for nothin phony
Just know da thang homie
My money mine homie
No need for number crunchin
Them suckas come down
They know the rocket launchin
Soon as I blast off
Then I salute da plug
We don’t fuck with niggas
And that’s on everything a nigga love

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
I ain't neva gave no fuck
That’s right nigga we back
Twenty fouteen till the finish nigga
