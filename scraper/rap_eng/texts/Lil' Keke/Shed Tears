(*talking*)
This gon come, from the big book
Hood classics check it, the whole world that's right

[Hook - 2x]
Shed tears for the ghetto, did they hear my cry
Trying to get rich and live, 'fore it's time to die
Hold your head up, my niggas and stand tall
Love it winter another spring, another summer and fall

[Lil' Keke]
It's going down, you know the bible searching
Watching back snatched, to he the ATF working
Two time felon, hit the do' bailing
Boys better duck, bust your head like a melon
It be do or die niggas, on the street
Young niggas 13, rolling mad heat
A jungle out here, call it Mad City
Plus these niggas snitching, and they really acting shitty
Play it safe mayn, one deep hitting stangs
Since the year '85, mayn the game changed
When the streets watching, you better watch ya back
Cause you can be, looking down the barrel of a gat

Back in 9-3, we had the Rock Hall jumping
Young niggas up all night, straight pumping
Fifty packs and qaurters, halves and zip's
Give a crash star a dime, all night she flip
I'm on to four and a half, pay two for the powder
Now she flipping wholesales, every hour
If I cook it myself, then the price is cheaper
Stepped off the corner, start working my beeper
Got a half a eight-five, prepared to go live
Hitting corners hitting cuts, I got's to ride by
It's on mayn, cell phone mayn
Got the bird sixteen, getting gone mayn
This is street life, under the street lights
The trunk punching on the slab, like a Roy fight
Get a fifth of Alize, and take it straight to the dome
Ain't no sense in bullshitting, get your thug on thug on

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
Now the judge tripping, she wanna give me a nick'
But my workers on the street, they ain't finished the brick
This a bad life, time to do some'ing else
Like a million c.d.'s, flying off the shelf
Stocks and bonds, mutual funds
Making money by the ton, packing plenty of guns
This the good life, better get it while ya can
My click be in the mix, yeah we back in demand
Steady paper hunting, not no weak fronting
And ya only live once, better start stunting
It's the ghetto, another level
And I'll dig a bigger ditch, with a shovel come on

[Hook - 2x]
