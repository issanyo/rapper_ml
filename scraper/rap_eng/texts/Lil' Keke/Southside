Verse1

I woke up early, jumped in the butta
[Versace]sace shades pushing blades, let them four burn rubber
I swung and I swang, you know that nigga clean
Hit the Belfort and the King, Europeans with the screens
Big ol 4's swang, everything cash
Glass pop red throw the wood in the dash
Mashin on the gas is a thug like Green
Prompt for a young I see not in the pen
Showin naked ass and my stories `bout to kill ya
Seventeen hundred west apple over silver
Hit the school zone, four 18's shook
Caught that lil deuce sideways sittin crooked
Pulled in Exxon nothing less then supreme
Never slippin but I'm trippin candy red on the scene
Flossin on the hoes, tossin on the women
Gotta pop the trunk for that nigga pat lemon

Alright we're thowin up the deuce
And giving niggas dab
You know the Southside actin bad on the slab, (uh-huh)
We're throwing up the deuce
And giving niggas dab
You know the Southside actin bad on the slab, (alright)
We're throwing up the deuce
And giving niggas dab
You know the Southside actin bad on the slab, (what?)
I'm throwing up the deuce, and giving niggas dab
You know the Southside actin bad on the slab

Verse2

Ashes to ashes dust to dust
Lead in the bus, sweets and tusk
Mobbin heavy in a Chevy
Breaking concrete, Polo on my body and Nikes on my feet
Hold ya horses these is choices in the presence of a playa
Buckle up the belt through the Southern Himalayas
Raise up off the dick , because you see ya nigga glowin
Over seas blowing trees with a long hair samoan
Mary Jane on the plane ain't a damn thing changed
Piece'o chain, diamond ring, cause I'm throwed in the game
Back in nine-five I was broke catching cabs
Fuck 'em all I'm a ball. Chop it up on the slab

Chorus :

Cause I'm throwing up the deuce
And giving niggas dab
You know the Southside actin bad on the slab
Alright we thorwing up the deuce
And giving niggas dab
You know the Southside actin bad on the slab
We do the Southside, the Southside, yeah
The Southside, the Southside, everybody do the
Southside, the Southside, yeah
The Southside, the Southside, yeah

Raise yo hands, so so high, rub ya head, and do the Southside
Do the shockin' and the rockin', from left to right
Look fly, get high with ya swisha rolled tight
I might just do, the Southside with you
It's easy and new, break it down and jam it screwed
Throw it stanky, girl, if that's the way you hit 'em
Moving side to side with ya motion and ya rhythm
You still in move, stay in the groove
Keep your hands high and you really can't lose
I'm a lift my head, and keep my pride
And let the whole world do the damn Southside

We doin' the Southside, the Southside, yeah
The Southside, the Southside, everybody do the

The Southside, the Southside, raise your hands and do the

Verse 4

The Southside ain't through
The Southside it's here new and it's screw
And it's me Lil' Ke' and the Herschelwood click
If you don't like it get up off the Southside dick
Smoke another blunt
Pull another stunt
Jammed down in the front on a million dollar hunt
So raise your hands
And open up wide
And get yo ass fucked by the whole Southside
