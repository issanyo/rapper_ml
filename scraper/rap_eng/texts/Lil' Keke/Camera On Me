[Intro:]
Yeah

[Chorus:]
I’m posing like I  took a selfie
Put that camera on me
I’m too fly, shit I can’t help it
Put that camera on me
Shine that light, I like get the flashing
Like that camera on me
When I say I got that candy
Ain't no the camera on me
Click, click, click, click

Look how them hoes be on em
Neck and risk be frozen on em
Click, click, click, click

You betta hope this pistol jam

[Verse 1:]
Click, click, snap,snap
Oh yeah, the flash on
Let’s get the riches, fuck them bitches till this cash gone
20 gran in my pocket
Still strap with that rocket
I’m making this move and can’t none one a ya’ll stop it
Cameras on and they rollin
Young rich and I’m holdin
Couple bands on this belt
Bad  hoes they melt
I will neva hang with these snitch es
They just too bad for my health
So I instagram myself
Still flashing my wealth
Rich game so grown
Lights off but i’m on
Got that [?] pack and it’s strong
It’s so hard for us to get home
Came here with my  click

Yeah them cameras on and we turnt up
Let’s post up for this pic

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I Flex on we love it
Ya’ll niggas thuggin and puffin
Came from the bottom, we buzzin
Ya’ll niggas talk and we doesn’t
Nigga all we know is just money talk
Ain't nothin else we can rant about
Twoed up everywhere I go
That’s the reason why I got a funny walk
I’m just runnin these bands up
Ya’ll puttin hoes in these handcuffs
Closed fist, keep my hands cuffed
I was raised real, I’ma stand  tough
Niggas hate on my campaign
Fly shit, i’m on airplane
Stay the fuck in your damn lane
Real nigga do the damn thing
Momma told me get money
Daddy told me get bitches
Streets told me don’t trust em
I’m just minding my business
Grind hard no excuses
Fuck boys get the dueces
Don’t try me and my account nigga
My shooters Roz

[Chorus]
