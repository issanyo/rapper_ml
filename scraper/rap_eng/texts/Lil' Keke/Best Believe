[Intro]
Shout out to Mr. 4-20
Deb in the Dew, he a legend
Shout out to Paul Wall, the people champ
That's my brutha
I am Don, [?] time legend
Light one up!

[Hook: Devin The Dude]
Best believe I'm smokin' (I'm smokin')
Best believe I'm high (I'm high)
This shit will leave you chokin'
Niggas feel that weed, they fly (we can fly)
You know that I'm often hopin' (I'm still hopin', man)
That one day they will legalize (turn up)
Until that day comes (let's go)
I'll be gettin' pie

[Verse 1]
Every time I smoke sum, I wanna grab my keys and ride high
Lemme turn my speakers up so ye can hear me good when I ride by
Aye, bet believe I'm on loud, chockin' on the Benz, I'm so proud
All I see is that white cloud, flossin' by that ale dove
Yeah, how the hell I'mma turn that? When all these hoes done turned up
So much grass gettin' burned up
I want my cheque is gettin' cut
Can't wait till they legalize
High as fuck, I got eagle eyes
Tell these niggas I came to win
And I ain't gon' stop till I get the prize
Say, I'm in my zone now
Full of that kush, it's on now
Rollin' square, puff it up
Puffin' number square now
Best believe I fly high
Smoke that shit, I'm gettin' by
Black suit, black glide
White cup, nigga, white tie

[Hook: Devin The Dude]
Best believe I'm smokin' (I'm smokin')
Best believe I'm high (I'm high)
This shit will leave you chokin'
Niggas feel that weed, they fly (fly)
You know that I'm often hopin' (I'm still hopin', man)
That one day they will legalize (let's legalize this thang)
Until that day comes (pow wow)
I'll be gettin' pie

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
I'm smokin' California finest, and I'm drinkin' on Texas tea
I'm prayn that they legalize it
But until they do, I'm on the cream
Back relief, OG sex, saw with crack
Watchin' football, smokin' a baseball bat
Playboy, whacha know bout that?
Direct TV in my Cadillac
Four screens on four different games
Intoxicated off Indica
My doctor said it cured migraines (straight up)
Gang stains in my Polo
YOLO, smellin' like dodo
Got a team full of bad bitches like Molo
Hold up! And best belief the trick is sticky full of fingers
Shatter bud on all wax, shi-tivities on deck

[Hook: Devin The Dude]
Best believe I'm smokin' (I'm smokin')
Best believe I'm high (I'm high)
