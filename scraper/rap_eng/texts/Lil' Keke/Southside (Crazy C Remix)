I woke up early, jumped in that butta
Candy-red turnin' heads, let the Vogues burn rubber
I swog and I swang, you know a playa's clean
Hit the velvet and the keen, Europeans with a scream
Eldorado Coupe, everythang cash
Playas pop red, floss wood in the dash
Mashin' on the gas and them got it by the grill
Man you are not comin' through another bill
Showin' up and blowin' up I know I'm lookin' good
I had to show out when I come through the hood
Hit the school zone, four 18's shook it
Caught that boy Gottie sideways sittin' crooked
Pulled in Exxon nuttin' less than Supreme
Never slippin' but I'm trippin' candy red on the scene
Flossin' on the bopples, tossin' on the women
Gotta pop the trunk for my partner Pat Lennon

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Watchin' Lee and Brooks blowin' sweets at us
Mobb'n heavy in the Chevy, breakin' concrete
Polo on my body and Nikes on my feet
Hold your horses feel the tosses in the presence of a playa
Buckle up your belt through the Southern himalaya
Raise up off of Texas cause you see the South goin'
Overseas blowin' trees with a long Samoean
Mary Jane on the plane, ain't a damn thang changed
Piece of change, diamond ring, cause we throwed in the game
Back in '95 I was broke catchin' cows I left 'em all
Tied 'em up chopped 'em up on the salman

Cause we throwin' up the deuce, and givin' playas dab
You know the Southside actin' bad on the slab
All right we throwin' up the deuce and givin' playas dap
You know the Southside actin' bad on the slab

Rub yo head and do the Southside
Doin' the shockin' and the rockin' from left to right
We lookin' fly so fly with the Swisher rolled tight
I might just do the Southside with you
It's easy and new, drank'd out jammin' Screw
Go on shake it girls, if that's the way you hit 'em
Movin' side to side with your motion and your rhythm
Stick & move, stay in the groove
Keep your hand high and you really can't lose
