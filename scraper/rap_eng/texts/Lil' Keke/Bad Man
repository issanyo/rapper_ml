(Muhammad Ali's voice)
I'm a bad man - 4x

[Chorus]
I'm a bad man, ain't no way for me to stop
Call me a bad man, I'm tyring to take it to the top
I'm just a bad man, you really want some of this
Cause I'm a bad man

[Lil' Keke]
Got out the gate, they better pack up and run
Watch your step, oh lord, there he go here he come
Now surpriiiise, cause we back on the grind
I Capit-a-lize and make rookies apologize
Now feel this, if you's a player you can keep it
Houston we so throwed, I'm the best kept secret
This game funny, but I'm just looking for the money
Constantly riding dubs dropping tops when it's sunny
They say we country, they better check us again
Cause the truck, lex and benz they shipped without the ends
We did that, whether it's gold or plat
We gucci and iceberg like the rest of you cats
One of the biggest on the map, they call us clutch city
Hard in the paint, we killers like Frank Nitty
But back to the lecture at hand
Lil' Keke the Don and I'm a bad bad man

[Chorus]
I'm a bad man, ain't no way for me to stop
Call me a bad man, I'm tyring to take it to the top
I'm just a bad man, you really want some of this
Cause I'm a bad man
I'm a bad man, you know I'm ready to rock
Call me a bad man, trying to keep the blocks on hot
I'm just a bad man, you really want some of this
Cause I'm a bad man

[Lil' Keke]
I'm a bad man, I need a bad woman
I need a super bad broad that's gone keep it coming
It's time to hit it up, so she could eat it up
She on the floor, she acting bad it's time to beat it up
Because it's super-califragilistic expe-alidoshious
The game is sick, off the chain, ferocious
Like Roy Jones, the best pound for pound
If you want to test your skills I promise it's going down
A thug to be brought, guess who's turning it out
When I step up in the spot, I'm the shit no doubt
Southside we be ripping, 20 inch flipping
Riding with plenty tools cause we always tripping
Like Playstation 2, I just got more graphics
The measures that we play baby it's always drastic
Commission Muzic Group, prepare to straight suit
Sit fat, all plat, hop in a brand new coupe
Believe none of what you hear, and half of what you see
Cause right before your eyes it's a certified g
Getting paid on boys like according to plan
Coming straight up out of Texas I'm a, bad man

[Chorus]

[Lil' Keke]
You really want some of this then bring it on, say what
Stop talking that shit and heaven boy on the phone
I go in the booth, then I change like Clark Kent
Come out a super man and be ready to represent
Took the game by storm, talking cold or warm
Now I'm hotter than a fire that's bringing the 3 alarm
A bad man, you know we rugged and tough
Call me a bad man cause I keep on bringing it rough
Uh, perfect destination, platinum situation
My everyday life is like a weekend vacation
A savage, fool you know my click above average
Get out of line we so quick to let you have it
We hard hitters, with no cowards and no quitters
And stand that way, until the lord come get us
I told you before, that I'm a rhyming apparatus
Lil' Keke the Don hell yeah I'm the baddest

[Chorus]
