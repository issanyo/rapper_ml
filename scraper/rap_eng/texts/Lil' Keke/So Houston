[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
First I'ma open up one of these bottles
Then I'ma try to open up one of these models
Candy paint on my ride, styrofoam in my hand
So many speakers in the trunks, my shit sound just like the TSU band (Ocean of Souls)
Wood grain is what I'm grabbin' on
And Fat Pat is what I'm jammin' on (Tops Drop, Tops Drop)
Slow Down by Robert Earl Davis, better known DJ Screw
They was talkin' down, then nah-nah-nah, that's how all the DJ's DJ'ed, too (Screwed up the world)
And it's not H-Town, it's H-Tine
We swang-and-bang babies, the boulevard is our playground
Elbows and Vogues, '84's or '3's
We seeing money down south 'cause that's what we supposed to see

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
I'm so Houston
Pimp C would be proud of me
Fat Pat would be proud of me, yeah
And I'm so Houston
Big Moe would be proud of me
Big Hawk would be proud of me
I'm so Houston
DJ Screw would be proud of me
Big Mello would be proud of me, yeah
And I'm so Houston
Wickett Crickett would be proud of me
I know my momma would be proud of me

[Verse 2: Big Baby Flava]
South Side, North Side, East Side, we ride (we ride)
On the West you better keep your vest
Protect your chest or you will die
I know Moe'll be proud of me
I jumped in the game and tried to fulfill your legacy
Yeah the OG's teachin' me right-ight-ight
My city, we known for sellin' drank, pints-ints-ints
Pop Trunk, Body Rock, jam Screw
Splash Town still holdin', what it do?
If you think something sweet, you a fool
'Cause Big Baby gon' keep a toolie too

[Chorus: Z-Ro and Lil Keke]
I'm so Houston (Yes)
Pimp C would be proud of me
Fat Pat would be proud of me, (Yeah) yeah
And I'm so Houston (I'm so H-Tine)
Big Moe would be proud of me (Don Ke, I'm here)
Big Hawk would be proud of me
I'm so Houston (S.U.C Captain, my brother Ro, what's up?)
DJ Screw would be proud of me
Big Mello would be proud of me, yeah
And I'm so Houston
Wickett Crickett would be proud of me (I swear)
I know my momma would be proud of me (I swear)

[Verse 3: Lil Keke]
Ayy, blowin' grass in the drop and the crop strong
Slow speed, float by, and the top gone
Chopped up, Robert Earl, not a pop song
If they ain't '84's, then I ain't home
88, 6-10, South side
45, 59, let's ride
EZ TAG on the beltway, nigga
Gettin' ghost in the white and the foreign ain't Tide (I swear)
Bad bitches got a nigga on the run
And these snitches keep a nigga with a gun (Bow-bow)
Houston, Texas, where they don't bar none
S.U.C. day one, and they call him Young Don (Don Ke)
Gettin' payed when ya work stay clean
H-Town, yeah, I'm so 13
Ice it up, pour it up, mo' lean
Seven figures, eight figures, mo' cream my dream
95, it's a real hot day
Ridin' slab, might as well not play
Cuttin' corners in the real fresh [?]
Jammin' Ro in the Mo, Ridin' Blue over Grey
Yeah, my heart still in the slab line
Niggas hating, but they can't have mine
Yeah, we ball 'til we fall, stand tall
'Cause we so H-Tine, H-Tine

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
I'm so Houston
Pimp C would be proud of me
Fat Pat would be proud of me, yeah
And I'm so Houston
Big Moe would be proud of me
Big Hawk would be proud of me
I'm so Houston
DJ Screw would be proud of me
Big Mello would be proud of me, yeah
And I'm so Houston
Wickett Crickett would be proud of me
I know my momma would be proud of me
