We gone ride this one here all the way from Houston, Texas to the N.O
From the N.O. Back to Houston, Texas, Worldwide

First Verse (Kangol Slim):

We bailin' straight out of New Orleans, and headed straight to H-Town
Cuz this boy Keke, is bout to go down, but in a major way
We on the I-10 highway, so blaze the hay
Look like it's gonna be another day
We bes Partners-N-Crime, had you hoes actin' naughty off the

We wanna see ya shake it like a dog, come from out them draws
Won't you break a nigga off, let me hit'cha with this long
Fifth Ward from the South, Third Ward from the South
Seventeenth Ward from the South, everybody from the South
And we all bout it, down to see you girls come straight up out it
If you thinkin' that we fakin', girl I doubt it
Practically in heaven bouncin' up out the Z-28 Chevy
Go call your girlfriends, tell 'em that we ready
To hit the tele, we wanna see you girls take it off
Bounce that ass and come up out them draws

Chorus (Partners-N-Crime):

We wanna see you hoes take it off, take it off
Bounce that ass and come out them draws, out them draws

Shake, shake, shake it like a dog
Shake, shake, shake it like a dog

Second Verse (Lil' Keke):

Shake it baby, shake it, talkin' bout shakin' that thang
When I step up on the stage bitches makin' it swang
I'm not the one, Lil' Keke the Don, I straight wreck it
I'm screamin' Southside, got these hoes gettin' naked
All the playas in the place steady flashin' that cash
Hoes shakin' and bouncin', I'm talkin' bout movin' that ass
I'm puttin' it down, Lil' Keke lil' freaky from H-Town
I'ma shine and recline cuz I'm platinum bound
This commission rich niggas we some Southside dogs
Run my hand up your skirt, check for G-string draws
We in the club, nothin' but love it don't stop
Sittin' up outside in the Bentley Rolls drop
Party packed wall to wall got the whole place jumpin'
All the ladies on the floor it's time to shake somethin'
They bumpin', talkin' bout they ready for what?
Just hush all that chatter, and shake that butt Baby

Chorus

Third Verse (Misdemeanor):

See I like it when you shake that, make that groove
Pop that, twerk that, make your backside move
See it's somethin' about that G-string
That bring out that G-thang
Let it hang
Girl I promise I'ma make it ring
You doin' that, shakin' that like you don't want it Black
You comin' home?  Cuz girl I'm tryin' to christen that
Get into that, Keke that's how we do it Black
Ain't no stoppin' when they poppin' in the N.O.,
And on your side of town I know that's how the story goes
But when you here, dog, we gone drink all night, club all night
Man, we gone all night flight
Cuz the party don't stop in the N.O.,
And the bar don't close in the N.O.,
You told 'em right when you told 'em bout the Southside
The gettin' paid side, leavin' others outside
South Coast representin'
