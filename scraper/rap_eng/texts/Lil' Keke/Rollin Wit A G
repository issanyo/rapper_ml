[Verse 1-Short Dawg]
Well it's that boy Short, call me Texas Fresh
To me you niggas come second best
I spit the flows and I gets the hoes and I puts it on em, like extra stress
Boy ain't you heard that I'm getting bread, so I'mma stunt tonight on all y'all
My drink is purple, my chicks is red, and my cups is white just like Paul Wall
While they slackin' I stay stackin'
To tell the truth man I hate rapping
Got everything that they lacking, these niggas faking like play action
I lay back in that first class, take a trip straight over seas
Got O's of weed, a bunch of hoes indeed
And they on my neck like rosaries
I'm supposedly the best where I'm from
You don't agree? Then nigga F you too
Packs of codeine, yeah it got me numb
On tip like a nigga only wearing one shoe
I'm ill too ill think I need Blue Shield
I was selling drugs back when you was jamming Drew Hill
Coming through in coups like 'where the roof is?'
Which means I don't really give a damn how you feel

[Hook-Short Dawg (Lil Keke)]
You're rolling with a G (With a G)
And girl I been a hustler since the age of 14 so all I know is M.O.B. (M.O.B.)
Yeah, (Young Don) Yeah

[Verse 2-Lil Keke]
You're rolling with a gangsta now, stick to the schedule
Mobbing, mashing these hoes, this shit incredible
Texas, I'm repping it hard, yes I'm a legend there
Fuck what a hater is saying, man I never care
H-Town born, Gutta boy raised
40 Glock, Levi, Creased in New J's
Adolescent, Juvenile, getting it with my strong hand
Money over bitches, I'mma kill em like a grown man
Don Keys, 713, this shit is beautiful
A 20 with a three of that grease, watch what it do to ya
Gangsta I'm losing the roof soon as its sunny
What up to hustler, you, lil shawty, and Young Money

[Hook-Short Dawg]
You're rolling with a G
And girl I been a hustler since the age of 14 so all I know is M.O.B
Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 3-Short Dawg]
Your girl can't deny and say she ain't the flyest nigga that she done seen before
I don't lace broads, still keep a ho
No Ray Charles, I seize it tho
But she sees it too, call it double vision
I'm turning heads when I'm breezing through
Thats why these boys tryna cuff they women, been earning bread and I don't need the booth
While you was watching Pikachu
I was on the grind, bringing people through
Exchanging cash for a batch of hard, taking Mastercards and Visa's too
Ask about me, the whole Houston know
Different groups of ho's I had em boosting clothes
Up in campus housing, I was camping out
But then I dropped out, said I'mma use the floor
I got a call from a few labels
But I don't listen to these fools fables
If I cop its cause the jewels [?]
Got racks on me like pool tables
Most these rappers, I mistook um for some queers
Real nigga talk, ya'll fell on different ears
Yeah, I'm on point, thumb tack
These niggas know that I'm a G, like one stack

[Hook-Short Dawg]
You're rolling with a G, Yeah
And girl I been a hustler since the age of 14 so all I know is M.O.B
Yeah, Yeah
I tried tell you that you're rolling with a G, Yeah
And girl I been a hustler since the age of 14 so all I know is M.O.B
Yeah Yeah
