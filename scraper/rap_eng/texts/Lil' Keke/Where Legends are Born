Know I'm saying, S.U.C
Screwed Up Click mayn, the originals
This the Take Over, CMG my click
Custom Made Gangstaz, you know
It's the Teflon Don, ha-ha
MJ man do it like this, Southside

[Lil' Keke]
Sometimes I thank Pop, cause he dropped a seed
But he ain't never give mama, half the shit she need
At the age 14, start buying my weed
Too Short, Ice Cube or some Pac and Breed
I was way too young, to start shoveling them rocks
I use to be playing ball, now I'm chained to the block
Laws be jumping out, round six on Thursday
Stang and put it up, or try to bounce back early
Always rapping, or shooting some dice
At the age 19, my freestyle was nice
Was the first in the hood, with a anthem hit
I'm a legend in the street, this the thanks I get
Use to rap on the corner, with my hat turned back
I just wanna go to Screw, and do a track with Pat
I just wanna freestyle, let him see me spit
Then the dream came true, we the Screwed Up Click

[Hook - 2x]
This is H-Town Texas, where legends are born
And it's pain everyday, from the G's we mourn
We done lost another homie, Lord capture his soul
Hold your head behind the wall, where it's dark and cold

[H.A.W.K.]
Can't nan nigga, understand my pain
So don't even try to act, like you feeling me mayn
I'm still in the game, searching for that minute of fame
So I can attain, and really start having thangs
I'm working my brain, my homeboys catching a chain
Some got slained, mayn I've experienced pain
But knowledge is gained, you don't need colleges mayn
Just follow this mayn, and don't go against the grain
Can't name all the names, of the homies that died
Can't wipe away the tears, from everybody's eyes
But still I rise, I gotta keep hope alive
And I'm gon climb this mountain, in a four wheel drive
So to the deceased, all y'all rest in peace
Y'all gone from this world, of pain and grief
And my belief, is that I'll see y'all again
But until then, in Jesus name Amen

[Hook - 2x]
