(Chorus - Lil' Keke)
How ya like me now - cause I'm real
How ya like me - How ya like me now - cause I'm real
How ya like me - How ya like me now - cause I'm real
How ya like me - How ya like me now - cause I'm real
How ya like me - How ya like me now - cause I'm real
How ya like me - How ya like me now - cause I'm real
How ya like me - How ya like me now - cause I'm real
How ya like me - How ya like me now - cause I'm real
How ya like me

(Verse 1 - Trae)
R.I.P to H.A.W.K., so I swang a bumpa grill
Made it out the hood, but I'm in the hood still
Leather so soft, yeah I like the way it feel
Hoppin out fresh like I signed a million dollar deal
Yeah I'm the truth - 84's sittin on the truck
Haters on my nuts, while I'm ridin' with a Cuban slut
Or I can do the drop, trunk up - fifth ain't
Doors hoppin fly, while I'm sittin on some sick paint
Customized off Johhny yo shit ain't
Nose in the air, actin like my shit don't stank
I'm the King of the streets so I'm top rank
Bitch I'm from the West and I can roam where ya block can't
I walk nice so my whip stay shoe'd up
Beatin so hard it'll make ya throw ya food up
A.B.N still red, black, or blue'd up
And we don't wanna hear it - if it never been Screwed Up

(Chorus - Lil' Keke)

(Verse 2 - Big Pokey)
Me I'm all about the cash, cause I love grindin
Labels want me to cut 'em something, like a blood diamond
Two stacks in my hand at the club climbin
Popped the band, made it rain - now the club drownin
Use to drop niggas, now I let the snub down him
Leave 'em in the parkin lot and let the club find him
75 corners in the bezzell, yeah the bulb blindin
Diamonds the size of dice, cause I love shinin
They mad at me 'cause I'm livin the life
Paper'd up, taper'd up - in this linen - and - ice
Hot like the dice, make a chick look twice
It cost to floss dogg I done paid that price
Money come, money go - point scene money gone
52 out the door now a nigga money long
Niggas know the deal - stop, drop, and roll
Niggas know the fuckin dreal, you know who it is

(Chorus Till End - Lil' Keke)
