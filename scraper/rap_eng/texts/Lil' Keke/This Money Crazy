This money crazy, I'm losing my mind
This money crazy, I'm losing my mind
This money crazy, I'm losing my mind
Pulling bitches, getting paper as the same damn time
Say what?
Get back on the hustle like a fool with it
Get back on your hustle like a fool with it
Get back on your hustle like a fool with it
Show a band, blow a band, shit like that, I'm cool with it

[Verse 1]
Texas in this bitch, now what you sack about?
We bounce up on that shit and just go cash it out
Now I been burning loud, I feel like passing out
If you ain't with the team you just ass out
First one in the building and the last out
Them haters on my dick, I take the trash out
If you ain't running fast, he can tag that
I parked the hard top and pulled the rag
I'm cooking that cut a gram, love me for whom I am
Running with real niggas who really don't give a damn
God forgive me, we just want this plug money
All my life I hustled for this thug money
What? Throw that 50 up as if you feel good
I never left my hustle 'cause I'm still hood
It's don Keke, I show them hoes the fast life
Thinking about this paper, getting my cash right

[Hook]
This money crazy, I'm losing my mind
This money crazy, I'm losing my mind
This money crazy, I'm losing my mind
Pulling bitches, getting paper as the same damn time
Say what?
Get back on the hustle like a fool with it
Get back on your hustle like a fool with it
Get back on your hustle like a fool with it
Show a band, blow a band, shit like that, I'm cool with it

[Verse 2: Big Pokey]
It's simple, run by dimple, I be moving at a fast pace
If you ain't getting to the paper you in last place
I hustle hard for this money, I get mad K
See the boss about this business, keep the bank straight
Trash bags full of bricks, I'm coming for money
They say the jackals hit the trap and get none of the money
If they looking for the kid I'm abundant in money
They say them niggas make it rain, none of them money
K, cash, guap, scrilla, gotta have it, homie
It's good plan, pop a band, another record on me
Sensei Montana, they named me after Tony
Now I'm married to the money, holy matrimony

[Hook]
This money crazy, I'm losing my mind
This money crazy, I'm losing my mind
This money crazy, I'm losing my mind
Pulling bitches, getting paper as the same damn time
Say what?
Get back on the hustle like a fool with it
Get back on your hustle like a fool with it
Get back on your hustle like a fool with it
Show a band, blow a band, shit like that, I'm cool with it
