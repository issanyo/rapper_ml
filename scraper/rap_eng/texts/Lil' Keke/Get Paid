[Intro - spoken]
Another dilemma
Another problem we're faced with, man
Adversity, me and my click done seen it, man
I'm flipping through the pages of my diary
Through my journal
Just something I wrote to myself, man
Lil' Keke, the Don, the truth
Ya heard me? Check it

[Hook]
You got to catch yourself, 'fore you wreck yourself
Sometimes, you got to sit back and check yourself
Get pai-ai-aid, get paid, nigga
Pai-ai-aid, come on
You got to catch yourself, 'fore you wreck yourself
Sometimes, you got to sit back and check yourself
Get pai-ai-aid, get paid, nigga
Pai-ai-aid, come on

[Verse 1]
Dear diary, it's time to change my soul
I been living this way since I was twelve years old
Doing dirt for dirt, plenty people was hurt
All type of fly shit, when you're putting in work
Catching cases at early age done scarred me now
I done made a little cash, they want to rob me now
'Cause the future was so bright, feeling this limelight
In and out of pressure, on the real, that's my life
Look at this rap game, just like this cocaine
Niggas sell it out quick and going for more change
Got to do my thing, that's all I caught
Trying to fill up the stands for a large amount
So I hustle and stay strong, pray that I live long
Glock on my side, every night, it stay on
I swear I play on, it's serious with me
I done saw a bunch of shit and got a lot to see

[Hook]
You got to catch yourself, 'fore you wreck yourself
Sometimes, you got to sit back and check yourself
Get pai-ai-aid, get paid, nigga
Pai-ai-aid, come on
You got to catch yourself, 'fore you wreck yourself
Sometimes, you got to sit back and check yourself
Get pai-ai-aid, get paid, nigga
Pai-ai-aid, come on

[Verse 2]
My life ain't never been about no peaches and cream
I been on the down low, chasing the American dream
Started smoking good weed ten years ago
And the way I be stressed, I might smoke ten more
Don't play and stay focused, got to get that loot
More money and more problem, Biggie speaks the truth
Ain't no sense in me lying, man, my life is sin
I was raised on the block where you had to win
Where you had to grind, where you had to hustle
Me and my niggas came up, man, we had to struggle
Now, we're dying to bubble and we're looking to rise
You can tell I want this shit from the look in my eyes
So, I travel to get it, make a effort to go
Niggas roaching but I'm hoping I can open the door
So, I'm taking it slow, one step at a time
Get your game locked tight 'fore you're left behind

[Hook]
You got to catch yourself, 'fore you wreck yourself
Sometimes, you got to sit back and check yourself
Get pai-ai-aid, get paid, nigga
Pai-ai-aid, come on
You got to catch yourself, 'fore you wreck yourself
Sometimes, you got to sit back and check yourself
Get pai-ai-aid, get paid, nigga
Pai-ai-aid, come on

[Outro - spoken]
Yeah, fuck what y'all niggas thinking
You know, that's another chapter out of my motherfucking book
You know, growing up, Houston, Texas
Much love to the 7-1-3
CMG is my click, man
We're going to grind and get more, man
All my niggas get paid, know what I'm saying?
Hustle, grind, get your fetti
Get your chips, man
Get your dollars, get your bread
Dinero, you know, whatever it take, man
Get out there and get yours
We ain't going to beg for a motherfucking thing
Fuck these hoes, man, you know what I'm saying?
A bitch perish first, that's what [?] said
Off the motherfucking rip
We're going to get this money, we're going to stay low
And we're going to put it in your motherfucking face
That's what [?] said
Ask Bodean, we tripping?
You know, shit sitting taller than a motherfucker
Boys ain't coming out no more
They're peeping, they're checking the windows and see when we're coming
Ain't no sense in that shit
