[Intro: 2Win]
Baby you should come with me

[Hook: 2Win]
Sittin' here blowin' on the dro
And I don't know which way to go
Baby you should come with me
Leanin' hard, I just poured up a 4
So high got a nigga eyes low
Baby you should come with me
Mouth dry, got a nigga movin' slow
Baby you should come with me

[Verse 1: 2Win]
Smoke so much I can't remember where I met her
Probably fuck all of my friends if I let her
You know the juice make 'em treat you like a king
Out in Houston got 'em tucked out on the lean
I knew I had her when she said she loved the car
Super head say she only fucking with stars
I'm so high I'm lookin' down at the stars
Couple drinks and I spike it with the bars
In that Koop, middle finger to the laws
And we gon' shoot if the player run off
Come with me, baby we can go far
I take you somewhere you ain't never been before

[Hook: 2Win]
Sittin' here blowin' on the dro
And I don't know which way to go
Baby you should come with me
Leanin' hard, I just poured up a 4
So high got a nigga eyes low
Baby you should come with me
Mouth dry, got a nigga movin' slow
Baby you should come with me

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
Paul Wall baby, 2 cups
I'm out here leanin' like a kick stand
My cup muddy like a rainy day
I got that big money in my hands
And I got some more that's on the way
I don't play, grind all day
Seen and done it all for that pay
Crawling down that MLK
From Antoine Dr, done came a long way
Gettin' that bread 'till my hair turn gray
I'm "Screwtape-grey" with my homeboy Trae
Houston, Texas where I stay
Smokin' that hay everyday, all day, all day
I'm with this bitch thick as a snicker
My wrist twinkling flicker
Pour the 4's making me hick up
My chips up, I'm paid
My paper up to the ceiling
But the Koop ain't got no ceiling
This bopper catching feelings
Cause I caught her on camera stealing
She blamed it on the molly
In love with my money, told the bitch I'm Paul Wally
She wanted me to train her
But she wouldn't get off the trolley
So I send her back to Riley
Then I told her friend to call me, come with me
Come with me

[Hook: 2Win]
Sittin' here blowin' on the dro
And I don't know which way to go
Baby you should come with me
Leanin' hard, I just poured up a 4
So high got a nigga eyes low
Baby you should come with me
Mouth dry, got a nigga movin' slow
Baby you should come with me

[Verse 3: Lil Keke]
That's right, that's what it is
2Win, what's up nigga? Don Ke, the H-Town legend
713 homie, that's what it is
I'm on that money train, no staying
Ridin' low, movin' slow
Super fly, sky high
Pouring 4, blowing dro
'Soon as she come with me
I'mma break her down quick
Slidin' by and talk shit, keep 'em all ridin' dick
We be leanin', now she dreamin'
Ask me where I'm 'bout to go
Fast cars, super star
Purple sprite, I don't know
X buying gas, real nigga kush grass
ATL, molly blast got her showing naked ass
Pull up in that simple motion
I'm on that different potion
Baby why don't you go with me?
I can have us both floating
Don Ke, H-Town, ridin' with a full cup
Me and 2Win gettin it in, watch us when we pull up

[Hook: 2Win]
Sittin' here blowin' on the dro
And I don't know which way to go
Baby you should come with me
Leanin' hard, I just poured up a 4
So high got a nigga eyes low
Baby you should come with me
Mouth dry, got a nigga movin' slow
Baby you should come with me
