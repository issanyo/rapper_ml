[Intro]
Love it man

[Chorus]
25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
I gots to get paid
We've got 25 lighters on the dresser yessir
Gots to get paid

[Verse 1: DJ DMD]
I got 25 lighters for my 25 foes
'Bout to break the mic then break 25 mo'
'Bout to rip the track wit' 'bout 25 flows
And I'm pimpin' like a mac wit' 'bout 25 hoes
25 five-carat diamonds in my ring
25 twelves in the trunk, got to bang
Make moves to make a quick 25 mill
Come up so I can knock off big nine-nine Seville
'Bout to take me 'bout 25 yellowbones home
Do 'em bad and make 'em 25 phone home
Call daddy, tell him 25 got to go
DMD done put it down, 25 out the door
Hittin' the highway, doin' 25 shows
25 limos slammin' 25 doors
Representin' fo' those holdin' 25 screws in they deck
I'ma wreck and rip 25 crews quick

[Chorus]
25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
I gots to get paid
We've got 25 lighters on the dresser, yessir
Gots to get paid (love it man)
25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
I gots to get paid
We've got 25 lighters on the dresser, yessir
Gots to get paid

[Verse 2: Lil' Keke]
I jumps up early and I yawns and stretch
Another day, another dollar, 'nother case to get
I take my time and realize that this game is real
I got my mind on foreign, but I'm swanging bumpa grill
Gots to act real bad when I close red doors
I'm shootin' spiders off my rims 'cause I'm ridin' on fours
And niggas don't understand that we be drinkin' the norm
Never trust broads, they're frauds
On the 'vard is where I slang when I claim my name
Back in the game Herschelwood, Texas regained
It's the nine-eight and I'm jumpin in the mix
Rocks up on my wrists and got haters on my list
How ya like me now? 'Cause I'm real
Comin' down piece and chain four shiny grills
Gots to bring havoc, let them boys have it
Fixin' to wreck the mic now it's that Fat Pat

[Chorus]
25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
I gots to get paid
We've got 25 lighters on the dresser, yessir
Gots to get paid (love it man)
25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
I gots to get paid
We've got 25 lighters on the dresser, yessir
Gots to get paid

[Verse 3: Fat Pat]
I'm so throwed in the game
Southside Playas, Screwed Up click mayne
Wit the Botany set you can bet them smoove as a 'vette
Comin through this motherfucker man, hold up it's lit
Some niggas catch me high like that
And some niggas act like they wanna pull a gat
But they betta watch out for the boy P-A-T
Ask them motherfuckin' haters can they handle me
'Cause I be so throwed in this game
Comin down on the swang
Grip wood grain, on the shirt I leave a stain
'Cause you tryna jack a real true G
Comin' down the boulevard, can ya see me
Swang and I swang and I swang to the left
Pop my trunk and yep yep yep
Niggas betta see a nigga roll
Starched down and I'm rollin on eighty fours
It's the nigga F-A-T represent the clique
Right up in the bowl and a whole lotta shit
You betta look around 'cause they don't understand it
I'ma say, "Hold up!" and scream, "God dammit!"
'Cause I'ma let the gat gone grip and gone take a trip
And if it's empty clip just throw it off the ship
'Cause it's a throwaway gat
It's that Fat Pat, where them haters at, where them haters at
Man love it man

[Chorus]
25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
I gots to get paid
We've got 25 lighters on the dresser, yessir
Gots to get paid (love it man)
25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
I gots to get paid
We've got 25 lighters on the dresser, yessir
Gots to get paid (love it man)
25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
I gots to get paid
We've got 25 lighters on the dresser, yessir
Gots to get paid (love it man)

[Outro]
That's how we do it, DMD, Keke, Fat Pat
G's in PA, G's in the city, G's in the South so real
G's in PA, G's in the city, G's in the South so real
