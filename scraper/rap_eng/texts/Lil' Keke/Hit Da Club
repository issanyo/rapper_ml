[Chorus:]
Hit the club
Spend this money up
Rolling another one [x7]

[Verse 1:]
I say we hit the club, spend this money up
I got a bad bitch [?]
Bout to get her pussy swoll
Twenties, fifties, hundreds in my bank bro, drink all
Dipping in a nice low, feeling good ice though
Meet the plug hit the club, we just call it boss mo
We got bitches, we got bottles
We got niggas burning bread
Smoking grass, shaking ass
