[Intro]
Peepin' in my window huh
What we gon' do about that, know what I'm talkin bout
Be cool, three shots to your dome

[Verse 1: Lil Keke]
Peepin' in my window, month of September
Riding foreign car in the winter
I got the wood for the summer time
Because I'm just a pimp in my own grind
I'm livin' the life of crime, I'm trippin' a dime, I'm movin' nine
You know I got a grill in my mouth
And everyday it shines
I got to buff it, I got to buff it nice
These niggas want me cause
I got the what cheaper price on the dope
My red beam has a scope
I'm comin' through and takin' a shower with some
Caress soap, got to smell good, I got to have a fragrance
Cause them hoes love me, them hoes wanna save me
Because I'm, just black as a tire
And you know I come through and acquire
Hoes wanna lie, never smoke fry
Got to be a G til the day that I die
Put me in my grave, never been a slave
Headed to the pool bought some drank from Lil Dave
Wassup big trunk, thats my big boy
Riding down the slab in my candy red toy
Lookin' so good, represent my hood
8100 block of Windemere and Herschelwood
What about Northdale across the tracks
What about the [?]
Hell yeah that got my back
Bodies gonna shoot, we gon' recruit em
[?]
And We gon' three piece suit em
Put em in a casket, measures got drastic
Got a ounce and its wrapped in some plastic
Weighin' twenty eight, thats a bunch of weight
I got to set it straight, I got my name on my plate
Keep peepin', never ever sleepin'
Drinkin' on the syrup and I gots to keep creepin'
Behind the Tec, got to stay bent
Almost lost my house because I forgot to pay my rent
Paid it yesterday, smoked the killer hay
The lord wasn't gon' bless me, if I didn't pray
So I done it again, my skin is my sin
Only thing I knew in life was what, tryna' win
Come up on the corner, I was a legend
To the game of crack, Lil Keke start pledgin'
Put my hand across my chest and I made a wish
When I get older I'ma eat a shrimp dish
Eat on the boat, ridin' candy coat
I got to come through garglin' everything but scope
In my throat
I'm lookin' good, I'm rollin' with that l
I'm hollering at Herschelwood, whats up big sal
All them boys real, riding bumper grill
Northside can't handle if I got loaded steel
Bustin' on a cracker, tryna' take me
L I to the L, K to the e, thats me
Why can't they see, I'ma G
Riding with the one to the three
And tell me, looking in the mirror
When I come through, on the grain I got to steer
Steady grain, causin' pain, gallons of caine, going insane
Insane in the brain, nice car, n piece and chain
I'm lookin' good, I got to make it across
A nigga like me
I'm poppin' trunk, not usin' no [?] boss
I got to use [?]
Candy done got wetter
Wrote four pages of [?], I had to write a long letter
Make and stay paid, houses livin' laid
I got a big butler and a busted ass maid
Fuckin' me on the cool, breakin' the golden rule
A nigga like me, a nigga like me
Go in the back door and jump in the pool, on the board
Afford anything I want
A nigga like me is gonna get on the mic, man, cuz

[Verse 2: Big Pokey]
Nigga I ain't trippin'
I done got crunk through a river in my kitchen
Gotta cook, a lotta water [?] fish
On my motherfuckin' [?] dish
Fried, I done got high
I done came down, poured a four, asked my why
High as escalade, get paid
Go to my room, I ain't bring my fuckin' shades
Its getting sunny, I'm lookin' out my fuckin window
Hoes love me
Gotta stay throwed, know what I'm sayin'

Give it a chance, make the candy dance
I grab the clothes out the car, the [?] in my pants
What about my shirt, I'm puttin' in the work
And everyday on the cut, I gotta hit it where it hurt
Ridin' on the skrt, I'm hollerin' at the purp
Everyday I gotta grab the syrup and the Squirt
Inside the two liter, nine millimeter,man
A bitch, I feed her dick on the tongue
Make her get sprung
Big Bay water got my whole body numb
Cause I'm smokin' water, get smarter
Member back in the game I had the rock or the quarter
Never smoked the Moe, thats for a hoe
A nigga who do that his brains are movin' slow
I'mma smoke the weed, smoke and twist up
I'm ridin' in the truck with al, he ain't ridin' on[?]
He ridin' on the grain, de to the a
A nigga like me hangin' with the H.A.W.K
What about the rum, what about the weed
I am Keke, this is Pokey, this is lil troy, this is lil [?]
In the front room, I'm hollerin' at them girls, them hoes, man
They ain't gon' like that, but you know it now, I got the [?]
Thats the nina'
Candy keep gleamin', dope fiends be fiendin'
Niggas be dreamin', thinkin' they ridin' slab, tellin' all these lies
And you know a nigga like me is poppin' up with surprise
Gun on my thighs, you know I got to realize, chest ties
And every time I'm in your face hoes cry
I open up my mouth and the grill be shinin'
More than likely the truck open bumper kit reclinin'

I fell in love my with candy painted woman
Thats got me, workin' wood wheel
? in the front, I'm higher than a hill
Higher than the moon, higher than a hill
When I came through, I didn't pay my bills
Might get evicted, hoes just [?]
Jump inside that pussy fast, I sticked it
The pussy got stuck, fucked the hoe in the back of the a truck
Back in the game when I didn't even know Screw
9th grade G's with a cap of kangeroo
I used to wear the kangol, never been a hoe
Used to, Poyo never sport a fro
I always sport a fade, beams on the blade
Got my money made from the cradle to the grave
Ounces gettin' weighed, weighin' em to twenty eight
Comin' through, bosses, sideways on my plate
Scoopin' up papi, hoes wanna drop me
Can't knock me
Our shirts say Versace, Versace shoes
Got Versace socks
Comin' through with Glocks, got the green with the rocks
Rocks on my piece, pants with a crease
Pockets gon swell, nigga might as well
Wreck those hoes waistes
[?]
Pop the trunk open
Gonna show my surround
Hand on the wood, yup you grippin' grain
On the yellow stone, fuckin' with the Jessie James
Can't forget the junior, can't forget the Sig, can't forget the trash
Cause trash is ridin' red, trash is ridin' red up the block
I passed by my crib cause I was flyin' in my jet
I done looked down but the nigga didn't care
Catch me on the fifth of Miami, finna trap
I'mma [?] Miami
I'mma drip candy
Rep the H town cause them hoes understand me
I just played the field [?]
1996 makin' still drug deals
Stain wood hitter, supposed to hit a lick
Get on my pen and paper right to the stick
Write to the jail cause my partner got locked
When he get out I'm clowin' know what I'm talkin' bout
I got to hit the pros, slam in on the nose
Slammin' foreign doors, slammin' double doors
Doors of the wood
I done came down, grip the Herschelwood
Hit the yellow stone, flip it to the Clover
Got a yellow bone in the bed turned over
I'm hit you from the back, run up in your guts
Them I'm gettin' off, burnin' off in my truck
Got the Glock in my thighs
Come through on blades, pop trunk its customized
Sittin' extra big, sittin' heavy like Guiseppe
Scoopin' up my partner, yup thats [?] fun
Got them hoes sprung
[?]
Broke them boys off
Boys from the north
Grill in my mouth, and you know what I'm talkin' bout

Come through their hood and I'll be sittin' sideways
Gotta make my mail
Ounces gon' swell

Shoot the [?] cause I done got paid
Asleep so today be a fade
