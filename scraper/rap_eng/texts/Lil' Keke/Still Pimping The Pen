I'm still draped up and dripped out, reclining the top
Straight up, outta H-Town and the funk don't stop
Watch the trunk just pop, and the front end hop
I'mma swang on these boppers, I'mma clown these cops
Candy red out the shop, I'm leaving paint on the street
Sippin' syrup, slangin' birds, smokin' indo sweets
Out of state on that plexus, cause the plates say Texas
TV screen, Young & The Restless, in my G.S. Lexus
From Atlanta to Virginia through the Sunset Valley
Houston, all the way to Cali, got a Ford Federalli
Remember that bitch Sally? They didn't like her walk
But she still gone get fucked by K Kay and the Hawk
Fat Pat and Mike D, what about Poke and the Screw
We gone bring her to the South and let the clique run through
It's real easy to see that ain't no fuckin' with me
I pimp the pen, once again, this is Lil' Keke

On the Southside, we be blowin' on tree
Pimpin' pens, once again, this is Lil' Keke, cause uh
On the Southside, we be blowin' on tree
Pimpin' pens, once again, this is Lil' Keke

It's time to lay em down, like cards on the table
Big crib, watching cat, ya gal lickin' my navel
Who's the man? And who's the G?
L to the I to the L to the K to the E to the K to the E that's me
Heart of a hustler, mind of a G
Punk-ass niggas can't fuck with me
Gimme cocaine and ?I'm lyrically?
Pimp stars throwed his hoes in check
Break a nigga neck if he don't respect
Black, blue pen write down the effect
Gone of the drank, got a bag of dank
Playa hatin' niggas they want to try the tank
I think I'mma have to kill when I come down
Chrome and blades and wood wheel
Pop another pill, damn fool better chill
Southside Houston Texas won't you tell me how you feel
Make another mil, while I pack my steel
Breakin' boys off with my freestyle drill
Higher than a hill, land of the trill
Pimpin' pens, hittin' skins, show nothin' but skills

On the Southside, we be blowin' on tree
Pimpin' pens, once again, this is Lil' Keke, cause uh
On the Southside, we be blowin' on tree
Pimpin' pens, once again, this is Lil' Keke

Verse three of the flow, if ya hoes did know
In and out the back door cause I gots to go
One more time I'mma flow, I'm a freestyle pro
Walkin' inside the club and dismantlin' the show
Houston, Texas, is the home of the players and pimps
'Sace down with a limp, across the sky in a blimp
I punch in clocks, don't like dumb jocks
I'm a player, I'm a baller, bagguettes and rocks
Word strainer entertainer in the eye of the public
Niggas love me, try to dub me, cause I stick to the subject
Again and again, nothing less than a win
Your foe or your friend, I'mma keep pimpin' pen, pimpin' pens
