[Hook]
Crack is what we selling, snitch niggas be telling
Keep you niggas bailing, here we go (here we go, here we go, here we go)
Crack is what we selling, snitch niggas be telling
Keep you niggas bailing, because we three time felons

[Lil' Keke]
Now peep game, I promise on sight it's going down
AK's and clips, that's filled with hundred rounds
It's my time no stress, I locate Tip
Tell him load up everything mayn, these boys a trip
I gotta call a meeting, so we can lay the format
We bout to sweep the whole streets, yeah the Don said that
I put my life up on it, these niggas gonna come up missing
Lying talking and snitching, in these streets big sixing
Don't play these games, because you think you a star
You might of had yourself a battle, but you ain't ready for war
This shit is complicated, that's why you mark niggas hate it
Scared to roll the dice, because you punks can't fade it
They hesitated, to even test it again
That's why they perpetrated, because they click is pretend
I'm on a paper chase, you know the road to riches
Serious about my feddy, and I'm busting all snitches what

[Hook]

[H.A.W.K.]
Here we go-here we go-here we go-here we go, it's  a must I get my do'
It's a must I move this snow, befo' the FEDs kick in my do'
Crack is what I'm selling, these fake ass niggas telling
My mama is raising hell'n, crying screaming and yelling
Lots of dogs smelling, around my residence
They looking for evidence, and mob they presidents
On cuts I'm legendary, by any means necessary
These cake ass niggas scary, and singing like canaries
You'll find a cemetery, if you caught up in my mix
I still hit brick licks, and I'm good with arithmetic
This game is getting deep, and I'm playing for keeps
Contaminating the streets, while you broke niggas sleep

[Lil' Keke]
It ain't no telling bout this click, cause you know we don't play
It be forever and a day, with that H-A-W-K
It's the 2 double 2, flipping pies we ain't through
C.D.'s and LP's, for the people like you
Get your mash on whoalie, get your cash on whoalie
Niggas snitching and bitching, but I promise they don't know me
It's a trip mayn, because these punk niggas telling
Commission rich click, we some three time felons what

[Hook]

[Lil' Keke]
Let's get this money baby, now it's a dangerous job
Y'all so close to getting robbed, by the Southside mob
We do the dumping nigga, and it don't matter the state
Y'all continue to playa hate, and get yourself checkmate
They better recognize, all this money and power
Cause it be hour after hour, on you mark ass cowards
I get's my cash, and fill up the stash befo' I flash
Superstars mash, with two hundred on the dash
This rap game, the legal crack game
You know it's cocaine and fame, on this hustler's name
I get's my money right, I'm dedicated for real
It be killas and drug dealers, that'll snatch out your grill
I lay the lick down, cause I'm gon get mine
And if these niggas out of line, then these niggas dying
I ain't the one mayn, you better watch who you telling
Lil' Keke the Don, also known as a felon

[Hook - 2x]
