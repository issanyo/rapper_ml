[Intro]
It's right, here we go

[Hook]
Even water, flame the pie
Whip 'em, rub 'em, ship 'em out
I been in this trap for days
Man, I swear this kitchen hot
It's comin' in, it's rollin' hard
It's comin' in, respect the game and pay the charge

[Verse 1]
Respect the game and pay the price
Weigh it up and whip it nice
Fuss it down and cook it right
Ship it out and seal it tight
Rocks and stones with the bricks
Made it thru the Tilly  shit
I get it cheap and sweep the streets (aye)
Now I'm stackin' biggalits
Rookies out here loosin' time
I ain't tryna lose a dime
Rollin' hard, they in the yard
I swear to God I'm on the grind
Man, I know my alphabets
LTF's and LTD's
I'm bout cheddar, I'm bout cheese
Smoke these pounds and whip these keys
Work, I see the change
Play the game and leave good
Bankroll sin' to slow, who gives a fuck?
I'm still hood
Profit first, know to win
Gotta say I'm gonna get
Connected down on Memphis10
Bitch, we got 'em comin' in

[Hook]
Even water, flame the pie
Whip 'em, rub 'em, ship 'em out
I been in this trap for days
Man, I swear this kitchen hot
It's comin' in, it's rollin' hard
It's comin' in, respect the game and pay the charge

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
If you wanna talk money, we in grind mode
Got my way around they kitchen, nigga, blindfold
I'm just a dope boy, dope flow, face know hip, I know so
Don't try him, he loco, yo, oh man, he still broke
Stash work in my bitches house, neva take my bitches out
Ain't no tanning, watch 'em work
I get a new stack and they get a new purse
Got a new Lamb' and they got a new [?]
Just got a new house but I got it off work
Got a new chop' and a brand new clip
If a nigga trap me, then his ass get murked
Nigga hustle fast like his ass in a race
Need to slow down befo' that ass catch a K
Been 100, stole, buy it, cook it in yo face
If you buy som' from me then it can't be replaced
Ignore a couple stacks in the galleria
2 or 3 place so I pot the seal
Check out all the ice within all the nights
Been to Memphis, bitch, so I pay the bills

[Hook]
Even water, flame the pie
Whip 'em, rub 'em, ship 'em out
I been in this trap for days
Man, I swear this kitchen hot
It's comin' in, it's rollin' hard
It's comin' in, respect the game and pay the charge
