[Intro - spoken]
What, young Don
BMS
Guess who's back, guess who's back? x4

[Hook - sung (singer unknown)]
Candy slab with wood grain, white guts
Acting bad for them things, get buck
Do you want to Southside with me?
Do you want to Southside with me?
Candy slab with wood grain, white guts
Acting bad for them things, get buck
Do you want to Southside with me?
Do you want to Southside with me?

[Verse 1: Lil' Keke]
It's the wood grain gripper, retired pie flipper
Twenty inch dipper with women on his zipper
The freestyle king, yeah, the freestyle man
Freestyle from H-Town to the Miami sand
Have you ever seen a gangster with the city on lock?
Southside representing, steady punching a clock
And I never leave home without the jet-black heater
Riding up on a slab, chromed out 2-seater
The whole world waiting, broke boys be hating
I be ice skating, rushing like Walter Payton
With something to slide to, the hoe just follow
You looking for a 'G', lil' mama, then go on, holler
Rolling and strolling and holding, 'cause I'm a factor
Lil' Keke, the Don, certified, a bad actor
Get paid on mics 'cause ain't nothing for free
And we can rock and roll, baby, on the South with me
Come on

[Verse 2: Lil' Keke]
I keep the Glock handy 'cause boys can't stand me
Draped and dripped out, you know we still riding candy
Let the top down and they shit out of luck
'Cause I'm a come through knocking, breaking concrete up
You know I mastered the game, they can't do it like Ke'
Got all these little niggas trying to rap like me
I hit the stage on fire, put the place into flames
I be smoking purple haze but I'm Texas-raised
We used to rap it, drop it, you know they can't stop it
When Screw hit the tables, he mix it and chop it
Houston style, you know, that's how the South does it
The young Don touch it, the public, they love it
I wreck it, write it, recite it, spit it
Chickens and OG's, them thugs go get it
The place off the chain, man, wherever I be
And you can rock and roll, baby, on the South with me

[Verse 3: Young Zay]
Uh oh, look, look
You acting bad, this is gon' make them things get buck
Michael Jordans on slabs when [?] pull up
I'm jumping out, I got the South on my back
'Cause 97.9% of these rappers is wack
Air Force Ones on, look like I [?] for the [?]
Young team, stay young, I recruit for the game
Do what you do, claim what you claim
Things that I got will make the game change
Trunk opened up, I'll make the lane change
Mane, it's a Southside thing
I'll bring flames so hot, we melt you haters
Watch made from a game, looking lame, next to my Jacob's
I'm that South coast, get it, with Ke' and Young Zay
Hating on the Southside, it's gon' be a long day
Teams and grown mens-es, Benzes on chokers
Candies on everything, yes, Jerry Springer or Oprah
Call Cleo, ask about this young heat holder
For 2.99 a minute, she'll tell you the game's over
Southside!
