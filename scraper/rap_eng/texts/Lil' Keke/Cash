[Hook]
I got my mind, on getting paid right now
Purchased the whole thing, cause ain't no breakdown
I got my mind, on getting paid right now
Purchased the whole thing, cause ain't no breakdown
Cash, cash
Motherfucker's know I hustle instead of sitting on my ass I love cash
I'm talking cash, cash
Hit the block so I can add up first, these nigga's last motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Long time running, lifestyle is stunting
Ya, I'm working like I want it so tell them nigga's Im coming
Fuck going back, we'll stick to what's in front of me
Gutta' street music, real nigga economy
Kill boy's softly, keeping nigga's up off me
Still rich, black, and hot like fresh coffee
Ain't no snitch here, ain't no Ross cop
Get you a thirty-six, cause that's what we got left

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Young don, a motherfucking monster
Trash ass nigga's, I show them the first dumpster
Houston a big city, we got them white blocks
Covered in yellow gold, flashing them white rocks
Purchased the whole thing, paid twenty-five for it
Didn't keep your mouth closed, the feds will never know it
Nigga's is sitting home, scared and looking timid
We on some street shit, taking it to the limit

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bring it back, give it to em' raw
I'm here to switch my style up, and serve em' Southpaw
My mind made up, I can't change that
My shine paid for, I can't change that
Seven plus one a tray, hustle plus U.S.A
I'm still a gangster nigga, rep for it everyday
Get you a whole brick, double your profit up
Or hate till your ass die, I really don't give a fuck
Young don, a motherfucking monster
Trash ass nigga's, I show them the first dumpster
Houston a big city, we got them white blocks
Covered in yellow gold, flashing them white rocks
Purchased the whole thing, paid twenty-five for it
Didn't keep your mouth closed, the feds will never know it
Nigga's is sitting home, scared and looking timid
We on some street shit, taking it to the limit
