(feat. Lil' Keke)

If you wanna dance to this, dance if that's how you feel
But my body don't move like that so I'm a chill
I'm a play the wall leavein' all the dancin' to ya'll
But we can party till somebody call the law
If you wanna dance to this, dance if that's how you feel
But my body don't move like that so I'm a chill
I'm a play the wall leavein' all the dancin' to ya'll
But we can party till somebody call the law

Hey, you can lean with' it rock with' it if you wanna
Do the chicken noodle soup with' me I'm a be in the corner
With my drank in my hand check'n out the spot
Baby girl do what snoop told you to do and drop it like it's hot
Your bodys taken over you don't stop it like it's not
Act like you from new orleans and pussy popin' I'm a watch
But since I'm by myself I got my pump on me
Watchin' out for my enemys because I know they love to jump and dump on me
Plus I got dimond as big as lisa rays lips
And everytime I hit the club I let my chain hang like Lil Flip
I know them jackers be out to get me dude
But like bonecrusher I ain't ever scared there's a gangsta standin' in my shoes
I'm a leave the dancin' to ya'll keepin' my back on the wall
Man I'm so drunk if I wasn't a playa I would probly fall
I'm a head buster
But I don't think I'm better then nobody else I just don't move like usher

If you wanna dance to this, dance if that's how you feel
But my body don't move like that so I'm a chill
I'm a play the wall leavein' all the dancin' to ya'll
But we can party till somebody call the law
If you wanna dance to this, dance if that's how you feel
But my body don't move like that so I'm a chill
I'm a play the wall leavein' all the dancin' to ya'll
But we can party till somebody call the law

I'm in chill mode homie anit no frontin' and fakin'
Steady laughin' at this niggas out here boucnin' and shakin'
Havin' drinks in the vip
I'm so clean I see some fellows in the crowd with a dance ruting
They got the same clothes on they rollin and tripin
A couple of brauds walk by they start popin' and tickin'
Got my back on the wall in the club with' Ro
And this part is done tho southside fixin to show
I'm on the stage getin' busy tryin' to do my work
And all I see is them little jeans and them tight ass shirts
God damn little homie what the world comin' to
I'm from the old school man we don't dance to screw
Tryin really get my pimp on brawls is boppin'
But I'm checkin out these niggas out here shockin' and rockin'
Let them all do they thing cause the game is fair
But I'm a gangsta from the south and we don't do that there

If you wanna dance to this, dance if that's how you feel
But my body don't move like that so I'm a chill
I'm a play the wall leavein' all the dancin' to ya'll
But we can party till somebody call the law
If you wanna dance to this, dance if that's how you feel
But my body don't move like that so I'm a chill
I'm a play the wall leavein' all the dancin' to ya'll
But we can party till somebody call the law

Now you can harlum shuffle or electric slide
But I'm like 3 six mafia movin' my body from side to side
Instead of doing the two step I shoot two tek's
I anit goin' to even crip walk even tho I down with the blue set
Cause we don't dance in the screwed up click
Unless you talkin' about boxin' we can do that shit
Lookin' for a cigarello to put my doegha in
Movin slow motion like I'm juevanile it soldier slim
The club is full of females cocolate, carmel, and bad ass yellow bone
Tryin to put they digets in my telphone
The music is bumpin' people throwin' they hands in the air
But other then bobbin' my head I'm a just stand there
Homie you know I got my weapon in my pocket
Might actadently shoot up the club if I actadently drop it
So I'm playin' it safe
Cause the moves I make
Are scareface I can't do the justin temberlake
Nigga

If you wanna dance to this, dance if that's how you feel

But we can party till somebody call the law
If you wanna dance to this, dance if that's how you feel
