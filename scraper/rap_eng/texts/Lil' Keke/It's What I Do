Check it hu-huh, it's the Young Don man
Tennessee-Texas connect, CMG my click C-Wiz
Holla at me young'n yeah, I get my hog on
That's what I do man, I'm a hog with it
Check it, freestyle

[Lil' Keke]
I'm a freestyling king, I don't joke
Catch me in the booth, and I'm firing up some smoke
I'll never be broke, cause I grind to the top
Catch me on the highway, letting down the top
In the drop, I'm sitting sideways and I'm crooked
It's the Young Don, got my time and I took it
Did my came back, in '94
I wrecked niggas, with my freestyle flow
It's 2005, I still go live
Young Don Ke', only the strong survive
I'm in the booth I'm spitting the truth, I'm bulletproof
A nigga in my way, I might knock out his tooth
It's the Young Don, representing CMG
I freestyle, I don't have to write it G
I'm a motherfucking vet, with my flow
I'm on this microphone, letting the whole world know
I'm fucking with that C-Wiz, and this is Texas
Back in '99, I drove in my new Lexus
Buttoned up on 20's, I ain't gon even front
Young Don Ke', and I'm known to pull a stunt
A freestyle assassin, nigga still blasting
Boys in the background, and they still asking
Where the Don at, I tell em that he back
I tell em on the microphone, bout to attack
I grab my fucking gat, I lay a nigga flat
I rat-ta-tat-tat, put him on his fucking back
Don't play with the Don, my niggas call me Young
It's the young one, and I do it for my son
Money by the ton, I make these niggas run
I pop-pop buck-buck, nigga with my gun
I lay you niggas down, repping H-Town
Popping trunks, still jamming to that Screw sound
Slowed Up Texas, we do it on the South
It's the Young Don, I got them diamonds in my mouth
Niggas just talking, niggas just yapping
I told these niggas, that I'm back hungry back rapping
I never be capping, I'm always just twisting
On the microphone, I got these niggas ass kissing
Now the Don back, I ain't looking for no friends
Catch me in that slingshot, coupe fo' do' Benz
500 nigga, I'm putting it on the plate
The Young Don, I only represent the Texas state
A freestyle legend, a freestyle pro
I'm the freestyle king, I let the whole world know
I started this verse, I'll make em put it in a hearse
Because your life is getting worse, I'm gift with the curse
Like my nigga Beanie said, I ride red
I leave these niggas dead, I'm hollin' at my niggas in the FED
Some of these niggas out here, still snitching
Some of em bitching, some of these niggas twisting
Like hoes, cause they the punkest
I'm hollin' at C-Will, cause I'm crunk with the crunkest
That's what we call our shit, the Tennessee-Texas connect
It's the Young Don, and I'm known to wreck give me the check

(*talking*)
C-Wiz, that's what it is nigga
That's real freestyle, holla
