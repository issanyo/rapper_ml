Gotta get it, (gotta get it)

[Lil' Keke]
This is street shit heat shit, you can be shit
Out of town niggas, get that 18 a ki shit
Hot shit drop shit, ya can't stop shit
Get ya hustle on mayn, take it to the top shit
All I know, is getting money getting do'
All I know, is getting money getting mo'
I'm riding in a new drop, strapped with twin Glocks
I need a J-Lo, yo Jenny from the block
I'm in San Francisco, rolling up endo
Passing by Alkatraz, smoking on good grass
At last a piece of my mind, a piece of the grind
I'm hoping after that, I get a piece of the shine what

[Hook - 4x]

[Lil' Keke]
At the top of the mountain, dripping like a fountain
Show after show, mayn this do' we counting
Lick after lick, mayn it's cash we talking
Have you bet it right, cause the bullshit walking
Welcome to the hood mayn, gorillas and pits
Chickens and grits, driveby's plenty of hits
This is Hersche' Texas, we'll take your Lexus
8100 blizzock, driving cars wreckless
Say we stocked up rocked up, ready to serve
The fiends be everywhere, thirty deep on the curb
This is Hustle Town, go on get it young nigga
The older we got man, our nuts got bigger what

[Hook - 4x]

[Lil' Keke]
They sipping on Grey Goose, talking bout getting loose
I've been getting paid, since they say bout nine-deuce
Hustle do my thang, gotta get my change
T.V.'s and DVD's, lighting up in the Range
We gon floss till daybreak, bang lik earthquakes
Get up in the morning, get dressed and get cake
Ghetto competition, the stocks is high
Niggas wanna looking good, when they sliding by
Houston Texas off the hook, that's that 7-1-3
Certified young baller, named Don Keke
Ask that nigga P, if we making that bread
C.M.G.-Avarice, and we shaking the FED huh

[Hook - 8x]

Gotta get this do'
