[Intro:]
I'm on it, stay lonely, got to top down for myself
Stay lonely, lonely by myself
Stay lonely, lonely, by myself, by myself

[Verse 1:]
Yeah, the fattest, mackest
Have summer charm in the biggest, blackest, statues global
But you can catch me in the streets
Poetry is what I write, novel killing in the beat
Green trees with my switcha ho
Doing a hundred tryin to keep the bitch up in the road
Marvin sang to me through the speakers
That roof crack me, niggas just to air it out a little
And I'm not answering the phone, I’m just
Just tryin to enjoy my zone
Money on my mind and a chest full of strong
Me and forty five so I'm really not alone

[Chorus:]
Stay rollin, I got the top down by myself
Stay rollin, rollin by myself
Gettin high all by myself
Stay rollin, rollin, by myself
I got the top down by myself
Stay rollin, rollin, rollin
Gettin high all by myself

[Verse 2:]
Money deep but I still ain’t lonely
The four five on me, sittin on somethin chromey
My homie told me he gonna try to ride this evening
I catch em later on, right now I’m blowin strong, gon
Flossing in a world of my own
Ain't really tryin to hear so I turned off the phone
The kush steady burning, top don turning
In love with my hustle so I 'm thinking bout my earnings
Oh yea, by the way, Texas where I stay
It’s definitely all good i’m with Keke today
But I'm ok, hit the inner state and make me a loof
I'm in the suicide drop that mean I’m rollin the coupe
I’m by myself

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
What should I say
My name Kevin Gates, people call me Kevin
And I rented six fifty blowing smoking up to the heaven
But that mean you should keep calm
Sleeves on each arm
Trees get chiefed on
Freaks we sleeped on
Percussion  in the trunk or what  others would call base
Old school hundreds containing small faces
In regard to weight kinda been gettin money
Really neva worked with no one spendin it fo me
Pockets, option
Inner state while I’m drivin in public, way out in public
Publicity when I’m shoppin
Lane change, change make
BWA just part of me bein me

[Chorus]
