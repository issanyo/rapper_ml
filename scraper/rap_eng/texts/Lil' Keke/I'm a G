I'm a G, ain't no telling what you cats might see baby
Check me out now, wholay..

[Lil' Keke]
You know I'm thugged out, cause that's the way I gotta survive
You know I'm dubbed out, on every ride that I drive
Let me take a moment, to introduce myself
Cause baby girl I see you want it, and I could tell you on it
It's the millennium, I'm trying to light up the stage
And I be taking it to the max, because I wanna stay paid
You know the album is hot, I'm in the spots you not
And if I pull a gun to shoot, then best believe you shot
Cause I'm a soldier a vet, with no time to sweat
From the store to the deck, and checking on internet
I be going off, girl you ain't heard about Lil' Keke
From the Dirty South, he got a bad mouth
It ain't no thang mayn, a bunch of haters in the world
Say it's a damn shame, but I just maintain no game
Get your cash and mash, on your plan
Cause the G in my life, stands for gangsta my man

[Hook - 2x]
I'm a G, it ain't no telling what you cats might see
You know the ladies shake it up, and it's for free
And I be getting my money first, cause that's me
Nigga, and that's me nigga

[Lil' Keke]
Bringing down the rap draft, cause I'm a first round pick
And from the booth to the stage, man I love that shit
You know the Northside, they say they love it the most
You know the Southside, quick to represent for they folk
You know the Eastside, they putting it down for the cheddar
And the Westside, you know they down for whatever
This another chapter, of the life after
Selling dope on the block, but now a paid rapper
I'm not a high capper, but I do get plex
Am I living like a baller, then the answer is yes
Listen up nigga, I ain't tripping when I tell you I'm about my scrilla
And I ain't tripping, when I tell you I'm a mad killa, but I'm a O.G
And when I'm gunning niggas running, cause they know me
You better show me, cause all that chatter don't just matter
Nigga homie, cause you gon owe me
Cause this the damn song, you playing games with my family
You get stepped on, so nigga get gone
The Southcoast's host, that you love the most
And you done came this far, and you still ain't close

[Hook - 2x]
