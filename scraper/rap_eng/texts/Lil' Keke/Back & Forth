[Verse 1:]
Take this fly, see this city
Hustle hard and get it quick
The leather’s soft, the paint is thick
The rims cost me a half a brick
Stop with all this kidding shit
I’m chasing fame and flying planes
Push it through them [?]
Get the switch and blow the brain
Back and forth and up and down
In and out another time
If it’s kush, we want the fine
If it ain’t then move around
Haters know I’m loving hustlin, thuggin for the money, boy
Hit the strip and circle back
I’m playing in my favorite toy
Uh, I’m old, man
Uh, I’m grown, man
Hit me with the bone game
Slipping, say the wrong thing
I run this town, I love it, bro
What you thank me, hustle for
It’s MOB I’m trying to fuck
So sucka why you puffin, huh

[Pre-Chorus:]
Back and forth and round and round
On them planes, up and down
Now them streets its flame and high
Guess who bout to run the town
Huh, I’m on, man
Huh, I’m grown, man
Let them haters do their thing
Now they’re in wrong lane

[Chorus:]
Huh, back and back and forth (and round and round)
And round and round
Huh, back and back and forth (and up and down)
Up and up and go, huh!
I’m back and forth (back and forth)
And round and round
Now them streets its flame and high
Guess who’s about to run the town

[Verse 2:]
Back and forth making mil
Making step in ATL
German boy he do it well
They gone need a bigger scale
Catch me on that paper trail
Catch me on that money run
Coupe costs me a hundred bun
I’m flipping with atomic guns
In and out and round we go
Prices flying out the door
Size shoe a 24
Up and down but neva slow
Get it cheap and let it go
If they purchase ten or more
Or just enough and turn it up
And calculate the cash flow
Uh, I’m old, man
Uh, I’m grown, man
Boy you in the wrong lane
Flaming like some propane
Time blows in inner state
Trust me dog it’s everywhere
We can get it anywhere
As long as the paper’s straight

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
