[Lil' Keke Verse]
You know what I came in this game
I woke up one morning I was thinking about the grain
Jumped in the drop, seats real butter
I turned up the bang and it made the trunk stutter
I'm ridin up the vard, I'm thinkin bout some bitches
I pass by Eddie, let him work on my switches
Now I'm gettin juice, pancakes droppin
It's the Young Don and the way he stoppin
I never ever stop, I smoke good crop
You know when I hold you know I come red out the shop
It might be apple, it might be brandy
Nine coats of clear, I got some wet ass candy
I'm comin out the south, since '93
D-O-N the K-E-K-E
Niggas know one thing, I bring hat
Freestyle king Young Don, Fat Pat
I did it from the top, I did it for the true
It's the Young Don still rep Hoover blue
What's up to them Bloods, it's a whole nation
Gangsta ass niggas, thug niggas on vacation
Suckas go home, my click still strong
I'm coming down candy red ridin on that bone
Bone in size, lookin light tan
Drop the top and swang four's to the sand
Now I'm at the water, hoes see us slaughter
It's the Young Don still chasin after daughters
Chasin after hoes ridin on four's, every time I ride I be on my tip toes
Gliding through the lane, holdin wood grain
Niggas know Young Don Ke do his thing
I came for the title, I came back hard
Sucka ass niggas had to give me my card
Now they still hidin, look at them run
I'm chasin niggas after with a what, chopper gun
Bustin boys down, suckas just a clown
7-1-3 I'm the king of the town, I'm still underground
I'm still hoover screw, I'm still coming hard and I'm still ridin blue
I'm ridin cobalt I might be ridin navy, it's the Young Don only God can save me
Lord help me, please come back, I'm diggin in my pocket and I'm bout to spend a stack
I'm still sellin crack, I'm still writing raps
It's the Young Don keep stars on my caps
Every time I ride, every time I slide
Suckas start runnin, boys start hidin
It's the Young Don, I'm ridin in the car
Freestyle king still a fucking super star
I'm still a what, king, I'm about to live a dream
Everytime I pull out I'm with a strong team
A team full of goons, higher than the moon
So much wood, it's lookin like a living room
Inside the vet, it's wet like a pet
Herschelwood, Texas still represent my set
I am the king listen to my tongue, hoes start listening and them hoes get sprung
I be breaking mics, I be breakin cars
It's the young don still tippin boulevards
What about the Chevy, it sits so heavy
Ima break the game up, if niggas let me
I'm outta H-Town, what's up Fat Pat, it's the Young Don hoes still try to chat
I holla at a dime, cause it ain't a crime
I'm hollerin at them niggas dressed in white doin time
Boys in the pen, stand up strong, it's the Young Don on the mic going long
I can't fall off, I represent the south, I spent 20 thousand on my mother fucking mouth
Now my rocks glow, 30 for a show, I'll break a hoe, niggas don't know
I still go hard, I still go what
And it's the Young Don might be ridin trophy truck
Sittin on the buck, sittin on the grey
Niggas better go home if they tryna play
I'll never do it, I'll never stop
It's the Young Don might just cut off the top
Let them see the inside, let them see the drop
Coming down all sunshine I don't pop trunk, I don't ride belt
I ride old school make sure the pain felt
Niggas don't stop, niggas still hatin, it's the Young Don might be ridin, ice skatin
Ridin on them four's, ridin on them spiders, never pay attention to them broke dick riders
Can't see me I can't be stopped, it's the Young Don smoking green colored crop
Smoking on the kush, smoking on the purple
Niggas talking down, I only fuck with my circle
Only my crew, this what it do, whats up Screw You, I still love you
It's the Young Don,I do it for my son,money by the ton,suckas on the run

[Z-Ro Verse]
Drinkin on soda, with the bar in it
You know what I'm talkin about, I'm in the coupe
I ain't walkin the lot, I parking lot pimp in the lot
Fuckin with these bad ass bitches, but I know they after riches
Not mine, I got a gun and I'ma cock mine
Hater gimme 50, drop down
My nigga C-Mo, and that boy Mike Mo down with Z-Ro
And that Lil' C, it's going down, nigga we representing H-Town
We'll lay you down in this bitch, don't talk shit we'll spray you down in this bitch quick
And all you niggas dead mane, cereal bowl holes in heads mane
That's real talk, hold up R.I.P. to Hawk
R.I.P. to Mo, R.I.P. to Chad, I don't need a pen and pad, I'm actin bad
Hold up I'm on that Madden, in the crib 1 deep and I'm saggin
Blue raggin and flaggin at the same time, did 17 murders with the same 9
God damn nigga, I'm just runnin my mouth, but I'm still reppin the south
Y'all know what I'm talkin about, walk in with the pistol, hit him, then I walk out
I get my mother fucking bread nigga, and guess what I got, 10 more bullets for your head nigga
Screwed Up Click all day long, I'm gone but I can run my block from a payphone
Why, cause I got OG cred, every time we hit the parkin lot we turn heads
Like Chad, and the mother fucking Bun did, I got bread about 100
What thousand dollars for the ABN, King of the Ghetto entertainment then
And that G-Maab entertain, Trae I love you mane, real talk
