I'm 'bout to make it rain, soon as I can change
So you can show me what that pussy made for
I'm here to spend this money, so take it off for me
Girl, I want you to show me what that pussy made for

Work the edge of the stage, I see it in your face
Girl, you wanna show me what that pussy made for
At the end of the night, I'm gonna do you right
Girl, you need to show me what that pussy made for
Show me what that pussy made for

I check ya forecast, they tell me when it rains, it pours
That pussy all mine, this money all yours
Don't get it twisted, I'm a G but I paid her
She took me to school and then showed me what's it made for

Super thick but bein' sexy wasn't the same thang
Between ya legs can get ya cheddar and a better name
I love ya stage show, get low so I can see
I got a couple of stacks for you, girl, believe me

I'm on patron with them kush squares and feelin' lovely
Work ya goal mind, say boo, you so lucky
Up and down, bust it open but then take it slow
I'm here to spend this money, you gon' have to show me tho'

I'm tryna go deep, more stomach and all kidneys
You keep 'em daydreamin', you got 'em so feignin'
That's what it's made for, show me the real meanin'

It's made for gettin' cash, it's made for breakin' hearts
You keep it drippin' wet, sex game is off the charts
Just lean back and let me take a glance, rain dance
I love it when you touch ya self with ya soft hands

You take it off and leave it off, you got it sittin' right
Come, get ya bread, boo 'cause I'm gon' spend it all night

She got a beast and she know what's it made for
