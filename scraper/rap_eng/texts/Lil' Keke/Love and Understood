The loving is understood
But I never thought, it would feel this good
The loving is understood
But I never thought, it would feel this good
But I never thought, it would feel this good

[Lil' Keke]
You've been hoping and wishing and waiting, for so long
Our love affair is finished, forgotten baby it's gone
We've been seeing eachother, I swear for some time
I told you everything, but you think that I'm still lying
My woman my kids my money, it's all there
My cards on the table, off jump it's in the air
You jazzy you thoed, that's cool it's all good
But keep it in your mind, that the loving is understood
Now how many thugs you know, that go hard
Sexuality, is whatever and don't bar
So get your slabs tight, while I get the raps right
I'll let you know tonight, while I'm sitting on the flight
Me and you together, now how long will it last
Cause I be making major moves, when it comes to my cash
You get your heart right, girl you know that you should
And I know you never thought, that it would feel this good

Three in the morning we going hard, nonstop
I work it and hit it, I'm trying to sho hit the spot
I let you get on top, so I can rest my back
You doing everything I want, I know you like it like that
But when you wake up to go to work, you know I'm gon fa sho
Don't mean to treat you like a hoe, but I got places to go
Over here right there, you catching me everywhere
Riding with pretty women, with beautiful long hair
Let your next move be your best move, that's cool
The loving understood, but I'm still a damn fool
With the D to the O the N, you can't win
Your homie your lover your nigga, and your best friend
Daytime night time, it's the right time
Girl you looking fine, you got something on your mind
Since school days, talking back in the hood
And I know you never thought, that it would feel this good

[Hook: Billy Cook]

[Lil' Keke]
Look at us now, a whole year passed by
Can't believe girl, that you still looking fly
As you can see, I'm still locked in the game
Went from one mill to two mill, and five and change
Everything's alright, I got my nigga sitting tight
My family living good, just enjoying they life
Back to you suga, you know the lecture at hand
A little time done passed, but I'm still your man
Hop in the backdo', I'm a mack though take it slow
Let's lay it on the line, put it down on the flo'
Test for test chest for chest, you give it all you got girl
Nothing mo', nothing less
I love the way you love to love, a young G
You know I'm living wrong, but you got feelings for me
You gon keep yourself up forever, that's understood
But I know you never thought, that it would feel this good
