[Intro:]
I ain’t goin let nobody hurt me
I’m not goin let nobody hurt my family
And I will kill you if you come around my kids with that bullshit
Ya’ll ain't helping
Look that ain't gangsta talk that’s real talk

[Chorus:]
All you see is money
All you see is hoes
All you see is cars
All you see is clothes
All you see is bottles
All you see is gold
Million dollar nigga
When I’m coming through the door
But you don’t know what I been thru
You don’t know what I’ve been thru [x7]

[Verse 1:]
Yo
As I stick my dick into this yellow bitch
I pray to God i never fall off
Never go back to 08
Riding in that Buick when them hoes would hate
Your main bitch wanna fornicate
She in my ear with that blah blah blah
She pinned me back on MySpace
Bitch you wanna suck this dick now
You don’t know what I’ve been thru
Watching my money make bills due
When the lights off at your momma house
Playing cell beasts in the [?]
When you look like you need help
Nobody goin help you
Stay 100 and stack these papers
Fuck these hoes and fuck these vapers
And fuck these rap niggas
These niggas fake too
Ya’ll cool as fuck until you pass them up
Then they hate you
You don’t know what I’ve been thru
Probably grippin [?]
Niggas wanna kill you
When they can’t be a part o’ your clique

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
You don’t know what I’ve been thru
And you don’t know what I’ve seen
Don King made me
Tio came for this dream
I’m in that sexy ‘lac
And i till it back
When I pass thru it’s 100
It’s been 15 in this rap thing
And I’m still not used to this money
So I turned up and I stayed on
Broke ass niggas done stayed home
I’m iced up and my ice white
I got that bling in my ice right
H-Town we been true
Down South we been screwed
They still tryna take my cash out
They don’t know what I’ve been thru
That southside I rep hard
Pimp game I check broad
Yeah BeatKing that your [?]
Street shit that’s my job
My team’s great
But we up late
And we still in love with this game
Understand my struggle nigga
Cause you ain’t feeling my pain

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
I ain’t goin let nobody hurt me
I’m not goin let nobody hurt my family
I ain’t goin let nobody hurt me
I’m not goin let nobody hurt my family
And I will kill you if you come around my kids with that bullshit
