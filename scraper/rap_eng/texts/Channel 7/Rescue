[Intro: Irv Gotti]
You still scared?
I'd be scared too
It's cool, though
Just holla back, aight?

[Verse 1: Ashanti]
All alone and I'm feeling warm and
Trying to wait, but my body's calling
You're the one, so why don't you come and rescue me?
I'll be here while you're on your way
And counting down 'til I see your face
And hurry up 'cause I love the way you rescue me
Now, you're here, come on out the rain and
Soaking wet, body's glistening
Finally, we can do something, so rescue me
Can't believe how it's going down
I'm so obsessed with this love I found
It's got my head spinning 'round and 'round, just rescue me

[Chorus (2x): Ashanti]
All night long
Take me away to another place
Rescue me
Save me, save me, save me

[Verse 2: Ashanti]
I come alive when I feel your touch
And I could drown in this pool of love
Now, you could get what i'm thinking of, come rescue me
What you think couldn't be replaced
If you were gone, I would find a way
To get you back 'cause I love the way you rescue me
Laying here with you in the dark
I always knew you could shift my heart
When I'm with you, I don't wanna stop, so rescue me
Only you can fulfill my needs
Take me away from this agony
I wanna live out my fantasy, just rescue me

[Chorus (2x): Ashanti]
All night long
Take me away to another place
Rescue me
Save me, save me, save me

[Bridge]

[Chorus (4x): Ashanti]
All night long
Take me away to another place
Rescue me
Save me, save me, save me
