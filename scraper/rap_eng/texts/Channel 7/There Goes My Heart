[Verse 1]
You know me well, we go too far back
How could anyone else compete with that?
So I just can't help feeling sentimental
About things in the past
We promised to keep it casual
But at times that can be so difficult
This relationship's so untypical
And I can't understand
Tell me why, tell me why

[Chorus]
First, you love me and then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms
There's no conclusion, you're so deceiving
'Cause I get taken in by your charms
Even though I try not to bend
There goes my heart again

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, why can't we be just friends?
It's a mess but we still pretend
Any fool could foresee the end
But there goes my heart again

[Verse 2]
When I feel your stare catching me off-guard
Boy, it's just not fair 'cause you know for sure
How to lure me in with that magnetic smile
Tell me why, tell me why

[Chorus]
First, you love me and then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms
There's no conclusion, you're so deceiving
'Cause I get taken in by your charms
Even though I try not to bend
There goes my heart again

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, why can't we be just friends?
It's a mess but we still pretend
Any fool could foresee the end
But there goes my heart again

[Break]
Tell me why, tell me why

[Chorus]
First, you love me and then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms
There's no conclusion, you're so deceiving
'Cause I get taken in by your charms
Even though I try so very hard not to bend
There goes my heart again
There goes, there goes
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
Baby, baby, baby, baby
There goes my heart again
Baby, baby, baby, baby
There goes my heart again
There goes
There goes my heart again
'Cause you love me then you leave me, baby
There goes my heart again
I try to keep it casual
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
