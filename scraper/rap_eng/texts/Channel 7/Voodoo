[Intro: Ashanti's Voicemail & Friend]
What's up?
You've reached Ashanti
Leave me a numeric message or a voice message
And I'll get back to you later
Hey, girl, what's up? It's me
Yo, man, remember, your friend?
Man, I've been calling you for the past few weeks
You never returned any of my calls
What happened? I thought I was gonna see you at the spot last night
Yo, everybody's asking for you
And you-know-who, he was looking for you like crazy
What's going on?
What's come over you?

[Chorus (2x): Ashanti]
I don't know what's come over me
I don't know, I don't know what's come over me

[Verse 1: Ashanti]
Because I never felt like this
I don't want to be wrong 'cause I like it
Thinking about you the way you kiss
I don't want to be wrong, but I like it
I think you stole my heart from me
See, I don't want to be wrong 'cause I like it
'Cause I belong to somebody
Even though it seems wrong, I can't fight it
It almost feels as if I'm not myself
Under a spell from someone else
I think I'm falling for somebody else
And I can't control myself
It's like some kind of hex on me
Controlling who I love and how I speak
And when he's gone, my heart won't beat
Tell me what's come over me

[Chorus (2x): Ashanti]
I don't know what's come over me
I don't know, I don't know what's come over me

[Verse 2: Ashanti]
Because I never felt like this
I don't want to be wrong 'cause I like it
Thinking about the way you kiss
I don't want to be wrong, but I like it
You got me thinking I should leave
See, I don't want to be wrong 'cause I like it
But I belong to somebody
Even though it seems wrong, I can't fight it
I know that I already have a love
He's all I know and all I trust
But lately, I've been falling out of love
I find myself so deep in love
And every time he's here with me
I look into his eyes so desperately
But now, it's not his face I see
Tell me what's come over me

[Chorus (2x): Ashanti]
I don't know what's come over me
I don't know, I don't know what's come over me

[Bridge: Ashanti]
(I don't know, I don't know)
I don't know (I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)
I just don't know what's come over me (I don't know, I don't know)
(I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)
It's like something is taking (I don't know, I don't know)
Complete control of me (I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)
(I don't know, I don't know)
I can't function, I'm not me (I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)

[Chorus (4x): Ashanti]
I don't know what's come over me
I don't know, I don't know what's come over me
