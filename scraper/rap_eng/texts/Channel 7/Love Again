[Intro]
Yeah
Man, I got somebody all that
He just got me feeling crazy
I mean, he really really did his thing
I think I fell in love again

[Chorus]
You came into my world and taught me things
And I can't lie 'cause boy, you did your thing
Feel like I'm floating when I hear your name
I think you made me fall in love again

[Verse 1]
I know it could be done like this
A simple touch could feel just like a kiss
And when you put your hands in certain places
Boy, I can't help but make them silly faces

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause what you doing to me, it should be a sin
It feels so good that I can barely hold it in
Boy, you...

[Chorus]
You came into my world and taught me things
And I can't lie 'cause boy, you did your thing
Feel like I'm floating when I hear your name
I think you made me fall in love again

[Verse 2]
I love to feel your heartbeat next to mine
It always seems to heat me up inside
It's crazy how we work up such a sweat
And I ain't never had it better ever since

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause what you doing to me, it should be a sin
It feels so good that I can barely hold it in
Boy, you...

[Chorus]
You came into my world and taught me things
And I can't lie 'cause boy, you did your thing
Feel like I'm floating when I hear your name
I think you made me fall in love again

[Bridge]
You stay on my mind
'Cause boy, I just can't find the
One to do them things that
You do ever since you came into my life

[Chorus (2x)]
You came into my world and taught me things
And I can't lie 'cause boy, you did your thing
Feel like I'm floating when I hear your name
I think you made me fall in love again
