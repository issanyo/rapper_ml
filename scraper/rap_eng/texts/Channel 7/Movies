[Verse 1]
Looking in the mirror, I can see myself
Standing in your arms, holding me
And kissing me and loving me
You just can't get enough of me
Now I'm on the phone
Telling you I'm all alone
So come on over, I'm out the shower now
About to oil down, I can't wait 'til you get here

[Chorus (2x)]
I wanna be like those girls in the movies
To have a man so in love, it makes him drop to his knees
She's even on his mind while he's asleep at night
'Cause that's the feeling you've given me

[Verse 2]
I'm almost ready to accept the truth
I'm in love with you and I wanna tell you
I'm glad that you're here
And now we're face to face
In the candlelight
I'm watching your eyes, watching my eyes
Laying here with you
Feels so good, feels so good

[Bridge]
With your hand in mine (hand in mine)
We don't have to worry about time (we don't have to worry about time)
Or what the future brings (or what it brings)
We can just let it be (we can let it be)
The way you smile at me (you smile at me)
I already see (I already see)
You don't wanna leave (don't wanna leave)
So we can just sit back, relax, and let it move naturally

[Chorus (4x)]
I wanna be like those girls in the movies
To have a man so in love, it makes him drop to his knees
She's even on his mind while he's asleep at night
'Cause that's the feeling you've given me

[Outro]
Yeah, that's the feeling baby, baby
Yeah, that's the feeling baby, baby
