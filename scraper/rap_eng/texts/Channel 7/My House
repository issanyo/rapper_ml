[Intro]
My house, my house, my house

[Chorus]
I don't even wanna go
Tell me that you love me so
Oh, I never wanna leave
Promise that you'll stay with me
I don't even wanna go
Tell me that you love me so
Oh, I never wanna leave
Promise that you'll stay here with me

[Verse 1]
Feels like you want me babe
And I'm gonna give it to you
This is my castle babe
I wanna help you find your way through so

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me know if you got no place to go (go, go, go)
Let you in my house baby we can flow (flow)
Let me know if you got no place to be (be, be, be)
You can ring my bell and come see me
(Ring my bell and come see me)

[Chorus]
You will never wanna go
Tell me how you love me so
You will never wanna leave
Promise that you'll stay with me

[Post-Chorus]
(Had you, had you, had you, had you)
My house
If I had you in my house
(Had you, had you, had you, had you)
My house
Oh, I want you in my house

[Verse 2]
Wait till you see what I've been hidin' upstairs
There's no security, take my hand and follow if you dare
If you kinda like that (?)
If I take you through my double door
Then you're gonna see some more

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me know if you got no place to go (go, go, go)
Let you in my house baby we can flow (flow)
Let me know if you got no place to be (be, be, be)
You can ring my bell and come see me
(Ring my bell and come see me)

[Chorus]
You will never wanna go
Tell me how you love me so
You will never wanna leave
My love will have you stayin' with me

[Post-Chorus]
(Had you, had you, had you, had you)
My house
If I had you in my house
(Had you, had you, had you, had you)
My house
Oh, I want you in my house

[Bridge]
Feels like you want it so much
Feels like you waitin' for my touch babe
Feels like you want me right now
And I'm about to give it to you

[Chorus]
You will never wanna go
Tell me how you love me so
You will never wanna leave
Promise that you'll stay with me

[Post-Chorus]
(Had you, had you, had you, had you)
My house
If I had you in my house
(Had you, had you, had you, had you)
My house
Oh, I want you in my house

[Outro]
(This infatuation, just to party babe...)
My house
(It's my house babe, and I'll drive you crazy...)
My house
(If you're gentle I will take you where you want me to)
If I had you in my house
