[Verse 1]
See, it's hard to tell somebody
That you're still somewhat
Attached to the dream
Of being in love once again
When it's clear they've moved on
So I sat down and wrote these few words
On the off chance you'd hear
And if you happened to be somewhere listening
You should know I'm still here

[Chorus]
If you really need me
Baby, just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby, all you ever need to do is call me and let love rush in

[Verse 2]
What can I say? I had a little extra time
So I figured I might as well explain
A couple little things to you
That you probably never knew
Like you'll always be an intrinsic part of me
Even though life goes on

[Chorus]
If you really need me
Baby, just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby, all you ever need to do is call me and let love rush in

[Bridge]
And my love will flow
Like the waves to the shore
You can fall into me
Once again effortlessly
And I'll comfort you so
Your heart won't hurt anymore
I'm waiting patiently

[Chorus]
If you really need me
Baby, just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby, all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
(If she hurts you or misleads you)
Is call me and let love rush in
(You can just call me, baby)
If you really need me
Baby, just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby, all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
If you really need me
Baby, just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby, all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
If you really need me
Baby, just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby, all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
