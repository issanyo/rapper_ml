[Chorus (2x)]
Can't believe that it's over, baby
But every bruise on my heart you gave me
See, we tried, but we fight, then we cried
Now it's over, babe, it's over, babe

[Verse 1]
When I met you, I knew you would be the one for me
'Cause looking at you had me feeling kind of crazy
Now, what you asked, I almost did it automatically
But it was nothing compared to the joy you gave me
Although I know that what we had it wasn't perfect babe
You fooled around, but see, back then it didn't phase me
I thought by staying, trying to change you would be worth it babe
But now I see that trying to change you only changed me

[Pre-Chorus]
All these tears
And all of your lies
All these years
And now we're saying goodbye
It's over, babe

[Chorus (2x)]
Can't believe that it's over, baby
But every bruise on my heart you gave me
See, we tried, but we fight, then we cried
Now it's over, babe, it's over, babe

[Verse 2]
Now, I'm thinking that I never should have dealt with you
All this screaming and this yelling that we go through
Raining late at night, I'm sitting, waiting up for you
Just to tell you how I hate who you turned into
See, ain't no way I'm gonna sit and take this shit from you
I'll never play another day of being your fool
I've wasted all my time on something that just wasn't true
I should have known I could never ever change you

[Pre-Chorus]
All these tears
And all of your lies
All these years
And now we're saying goodbye
It's over, babe

[Chorus (2x)]
Can't believe that it's over, baby
But every bruise on my heart you gave me
See, we tried, but we fight, then we cried
Now it's over, babe, it's over, babe

[Bridge]
I'll never forget what you did to me
So I'm gone, I'm leaving, leaving, baby
I'll never forget what you did to me
So I'm gone, I'm leaving, leaving, baby
Whenever you see me, don't even speak
I'll never forget what you did to me
Whenever you see me, don't even speak
I'll never forget what you did to me

[Chorus (4x)]
Can't believe that it's over, baby
But every bruise on my heart you gave me
See, we tried, but we fight, then we cried
Now it's over, babe, it's over, babe

[Outro]
I'll never forget what you did to me
So I'm gone, I'm leaving, leaving, baby
I'll never forget what you did to me
So I'm gone, I'm leaving
