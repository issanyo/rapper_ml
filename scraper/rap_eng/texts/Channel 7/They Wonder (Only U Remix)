[Verse 1]
They wonder, can you take it to this level
Making anything hot Naw I'm not the devil
A rebel for the truth  I'm a set the beast loose
Fire is holy don't know what they telling you
Burnin enemies and troops when the light shines through
They wanted the world dead they better be prepared
Send em to they own where they rather be known
But when they get there Christ is still on the throne
Give em credit for trying, I leave em begging for silence
We could use them on our side but they rather us die
An eye for an eye, but a lie won't fly
Check the density, got gravity on my side

[Hook]
They wonder, could I kill a beat like this?
Could I kill a beat like this?
They wonder, could I kill a beat like this?
Like this, like this, like this, like this?
They wonder, could I kill a beat like this? (Like this?)
Could I kill a beat like this?
They wonder, could I kill a beat like this?
Like this, like this, like this, like this?

[Verse 2]
Unexcused homicide is where I'm from
Product of my nature, one day is enough
They could never understand cause it sounds too tough
Or people understand but they leave out love
Show me what you got if you feel like you suck
Any rapper I taught sound platinum plus
Doubt is a foe that I challenge because
Anybody with it getting hit by the truck
Mak, since highschool I taught'em to duck
But, "Keep your head up," focus on what's above
Ingredients of survival, eliminating false idols
Even false titles can make a man suicidal or they try to

[Hook]
