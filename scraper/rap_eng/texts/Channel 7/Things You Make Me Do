(feat. Robin Thicke)

The things you make me do (ooh, oh babe, oh darling, oh no)
The things you make me do
The things you make me do
The things you make me do

(Verse 1)
I think every part of me, is addicted to your touch
Cause everything I got inside of me, got me needin' you so much

(Pre Chorus)
Got me open, got me coastin', got me floatin' babe
Got me jonesin', got me zonin', got me coin' craze
Boy, I'm shakin', body achin', got me waitin' babe
These are all the things, the things you make me do

(Chorus)
I'll be your wife, I'll be the air you breathe
I'll be your drug, do anything to me
I'll wash your dishes, blowin' kisses in the bubbles babe
I'll be your bad girl that loves to get in trouble, babe

I'll be your wife, I'll be the air you breathe
I'll be your drug, do anything to me
Take you shoppin' for some (?) buy you'll jewelry babe
And all my friends they think I'm crazy, the things you make me do

(Verse 2 (Robin Thicke))
Voice soft, the crazy hoarse, (can't get on the floor?)
Private performance, I'm beggin' - beggin for more
You're so naughty and nice, you're so naughty and nice
Run Ashanti, run, you know I wanna chase it

(Pre Chorus)
Got me open, got me coastin', got me floatin' babe
Got me jonesin', got me zonin', got me coin' craze
Boy, I'm shakin', body achin', got me waitin' babe
These are all the things, the things you make me do

(Chorus)
I'll be your wife, I'll be the air you breathe
I'll be your drug, do anything to me
I'll wash your dishes, blowin' kisses in the bubbles babe
I'll be your bad girl that loves to get in trouble, babe

I'll be your wife, I'll be the air you breathe
I'll be your drug, do anything to me
Take you shoppin' for some (?) buy you'll jewelry babe
And all my friends they think I'm crazy, the things you make me do

(Verse 3)
It's like your a fairy take, almost too good to be true
Cause even when I go to sleep at night, my body still be dreamin' you, hey, yeah

(Pre Chorus)
Got me open, got me coastin', got me floatin' babe
Got me jonesin', got me zonin', got me goin' craze
Boy, I'm shakin', body achin', got me waitin' babe
These are all the things, the things you make me do

(Chorus)
I'll be your wife, I'll be the air you breathe
I'll be your drug, do anything to me
I'll wash your dishes, blowin' kisses in the bubbles babe
I'll be your bad girl that loves to get in trouble, babe

I'll be your wife, I'll be the air you breathe
I'll be your drug, do anything to me
Take you shoppin' for some (?) buy you'll jewelry babe
And all my friends they think I'm crazy, the things you make me do

I'm crazy babe, they think I'm crazy babe
(You're so naughty and nice, you're so naughty and nice)
