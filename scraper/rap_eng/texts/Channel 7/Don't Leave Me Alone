[Intro: 7 Aurelius]
What up, Ashanti?

[Chorus: 7 Aurelius]
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)

[Verse 1: Ashanti]
Boy, why don't you just lay with me, stay with me
I would love it if you had your way with me
'Cause I just can't get enough of your touch
You do the things I need to me so much
I don't want to let you leave, I don't want to let you go
You're not even here with me, so don't leave me alone

[Chorus: 7 Aurelius & Ashanti]
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
No, no, oh
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
Don't leave me alone, oh oh oh
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
Yeah, oh

[Verse 2: Ashanti]
Now, if I could just be with you, breathe with you
If you were to ask me, I would leave with you
I will go around the globe, as long as I know
I would be right by your side, wherever you go
I ain't gonna let you leave, I don't want to let you go
Oh, I need you here with me

[Chorus: 7 Aurelius & Ashanti]
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
Hey, I don't want to leave you alone
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
I don't want to see you go, oh, don't go
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
Don't go, don't
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
Wherever you go, I will follow
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
'Cause I don't want to be alone, I don't want to let you go
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)

[Verse 3: Ashanti]
One of the reasons that I never want to be alone
Is that I like what happens to me when I'm in your arms
It feels like home
Where I belong
'Cause my heart smiles from inside out
Only you can do it to me, baby, you can do it to me
So I can't leave you alone

[Chorus: 7 Aurelius & Ashanti]
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
I just want to be in your arms all night long
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
I just, I just want to be in your arms all night long
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)

[Bridge: Ashanti & 7 Aurelius]
Ooh, baby
Baby, baby
Ooh, baby
Baby, baby
Leave me alone (leave me alone)

[Chorus: 7 Aurelius & Ashanti]
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
I just, I just want to be in your arms, want to stay all night long
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)
