[Intro: Kids]
My name is Courtnie Christina Cox
I'm nine years old
When I grow up, I wanna be a singer
My name is Kevin Taridue
I am six years old
When I grow up, I wanna be a football player
My name is Jasmine L. Morris
I am seven years old
When I grow up, I want to be a dancer
My name is Steven Gary Cox
I am eight years old
When I grow up, I wanna be a rapper
My name is Janae Dominique Tuck
When I grow up, I wanna be a doctor

[Chorus 1: Ashanti]
Dreams are real
All you have to do is just believe
Dreams are real
All you have to do is just believe

[Verse 1: Ashanti]
There is nothing that should ever
Take your heart away
From what it is you wanna do
You should always go with what you love
Don't follow no one else
Just do what's good for you

[Chorus 2: Ashanti]
Tell them dreams are real
All you have to do is just believe
Dreams are real
All you have to do is just believe

[Verse 2: Ashanti]
Sometimes, people try to bring you down
They wanna see you frown, just keep your faith in you
Doesn't matter if they try to tell you
That you'll never make it, this is what you do

[Chorus 2 (2x): Ashanti]
Tell them dreams are real
All you have to do is just believe
Dreams are real
All you have to do is just believe

[Chorus 1 (3x): Ashanti & Kids]
Dreams are real
All you have to do is just believe

[Outro: Kids]
I believe in myself
And my dreams will come true
