[Intro]
When you play by the rules of the world
The world will rule you
When you play by the rules of the divine
You will rule the world
Bring it back

(I’m falling, I’m falling, with no parachute
I’m falling, I'm falling, with no parachute)

[Hook]
All the way from Heaven to the stars
The stars pass along
The moon turns to sky
The sky turns to you
I’m falling, I’m falling, with no parachute
I’m falling, I'm falling, with no parachute

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
All the way form the heaven to the stars, to the moon, to your heart
I only fell to get up for you
My world anew, I put that on the cross
Give thanks to the Lord, the legend of the fall
Fuck you, no pause, niggas, make God bless us all
And then bless the dead as they bodies descend
From the ledge, to the roof, to the head, to the floor
Then watch demons hover over they corpse
It’s a long fall and a lot of niggas fall short
Unfortunately, a lot of niggas fall off
But not me, I could never see the ball drop
Unless it's New Year's in the heart of New York
If you’re new kid, the block get a little rough
Especially if the heart ain’t wide enough
Cause I've been through it all and I seen even more
Only the flyest of niggas get to fall

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
If I gave the devil a hug, I gave the Lord a kiss
From the Heavens above to the fire to my ashes
Nobody surpasses death, it don't last
It's all a legend, get Christ-like, come back, resurrection
Teflon - no use, can't kill me
I've already been dead, I'm a holy spirit
Watch my soul flow fly around like a G6
While my body stage dives in the audience
I’m living this, life limitless
If it ain’t fly, hash: no relevance
If it ain’t domestic, it’s not intelligent
You should be smart and don't jump off the deep end
The dark side, it's a long ride
Paint a portrait of the world and y'all dodge
Cause I've been through it all and I seen even more
Only the flyest of niggas get to fall

[Hook]

[Outro: Leah Siegal]
Thinking of you, with no parachute
