[Verse 1]
Now, see, I ain't the one to hold back all these words I'm saying
'Cause I like what you're doing to me, ain't no time for wasting
So won't you follow me, there ain't no need to say a thing
'Cause I know just what I want and how to get it, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight, I need your body
Tonight, you got my time
Tonight, you won't be sorry
Tonight, you got my body

[Chorus]
I want you, gotta have you
Said I need you, can you feel me?
Said I want you, gotta have you
Said I need you, can you feel me?

[Verse 2]
Now, I've been known to crush a brother once or twice before
But what you're bringing to the table looks like so much more
So can we go find out what you're about behind closed doors?
'Cause I know just what I want, here's what I'm asking for

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight, I need your body
Tonight, you got my time
Tonight, you won't be sorry
Tonight, you got my body

[Chorus]
I want you, gotta have you
Said I need you, can you feel me?
Said I want you, gotta have you
Said I need you, can you feel me?

[Bridge]
Can't help the way I'm feeling, baby, baby
Keep doing what you do that drive me crazy
'Cause I can never see nothing better than you and me
'Cause I'm looking for a full-time baby
Who's looking for a full-time lady
To be, be with me, yeah

[Chorus (2x)]
I want you, gotta have you
Said I need you, can you feel me?
Said I want you, gotta have you
Said I need you, can you feel me?
