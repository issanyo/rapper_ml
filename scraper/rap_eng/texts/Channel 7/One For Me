I'm writing you a letter
To let you know whats on my mind
Shawty i can love you better
Promise i won't waste your time
I think we should be together
If you agree show me a sign
Come give me a piece of heaven
Girl you opened up my eyes

You opened up my eyes
To the other side of love
Ive been waiting all my life
Could she be the one for me (for me)

I know you've got another
But baby he dont do you right
I can be your secret lover
Stare at you all through the night
All im asking girl is try me
Come with me i'll change your life
Show you things youve never seen
I can open up your eyes

You opened up my eyes
To the other side of love
Ive been waiting all my life
Seems i can't get enough
Cause girl your so fly
Could she be the one for me (for me)

You opened up my eyes
To the other side of love
Ive been waiting all my life
Seems i can't get enough
Cause girl your so fly
Could she be the one for me (for me)

Now i just want to love you down
Oh im so happy when your loves around
My lifes better when your closest
Feels like im above the clouds
And no, theres no, telling if ill touch the ground
I have no cares im floating (floating)

You opened up my eyes
To the other side of love
Ive been waiting all my life
Seems i can't get enough
Cause girl your so fly
Could she be the one for me (for me)

You opened up my eyes
To the other side of love
Ive been waiting all my life
Seems i can't get enough
Cause girl your so fly
Could she be the one for me (for me)
