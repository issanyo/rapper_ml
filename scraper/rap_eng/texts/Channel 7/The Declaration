(Chorus)
Never thought you'd be like, be like that ooh
But you know it all comes right back, comes right back ooh
Baby I'm still here, I'm still here, I'm still here
Baby I'm still here, I'm still here ooh

Never thought you'd be like, be like that ooh
But you know it all comes right back, comes right back ooh
Baby I'm still here, I'm still here, I'm still here
Baby I'm still here, I'm still here ooh

(Verse 1)
I used to look into your eyes and think, that you were the one that was meant for me
Everything that you would say, I believed it
You manipulated me, did it so creatively
Slowly took away from me, most of my integrity
Used to say that "I could be, everything and all you need"
Started doing little things back then I couldn't see, but now
That the rain is gone, yes I'm still here

(Chorus)
(I'm still here, and I see you for who you are
And you're not far from the devil babe
So pack my heart, and run away, so far away, yeah)

(Verse 2)
They used to tell me I was nothin', and couldn't make it there
And so I made it, and they hated, cause I'm stayin' here
I put my trust into my faith everyday
With all the blood and sweat and tears
All the passion, all the years
Now with clouds and lovin' cheers
No more cryin', no more fears
Used to cry myself to sleep, thinkin' this could never be

And then I picked myself back up and stood on my two feet
And now that the rain is gone

(Chorus)
(I'm still here, and I see you for who you are
And you're not far from the devil babe
So pack my heart, and run away, so far away, yeah)

Said I'm still here, said I'm still here
Said I'm still here, and I ain't no where
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah baby

Ohh, ohhh. Hey, hey, hey, said I'm still here
