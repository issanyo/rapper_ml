(Boy you know you wanna)
I want you (ooh) I want you (ooh)
Oh, and I want you to want me too
(Boy you know you wanna)
Oh, I want you (ooh) I want you (ooh)
Oh, and I want you to want me too

Let's go somewhere exciting
The only one who's invited
Baby I'm so excited
Come on please don't say no
Put your hands on this body
I'm your car you can drive me
What a feeling inside me
Do my best to...

Show you how real it is
If you wanna go tonight (oh-oh, ooh, oh-oh)
And I don't make no promises
I don't plan on bringing to life
Trust me when I say to you... (say to you)

(Boy you know you wanna)
I want you (you, ooh) I want you (you)
Oh...
