If you're just joining, we're in the studio tonight with Ashanti. How you feeling?

[Ashanti]
Feeling great, I'm excited

[Interviewer]
You look good. So, to your fans all over the world, your third album, what should they get from this?

[Ashanti]
Um, I really want people to feel me on this one. This is definitely my best album. I'm just really excited about it. The lyrics are just a little bit deeper, hooked back up with 7 Aurelius, so it's a beautiful thing

[Interviewer]
The album's crazy. So explain to everyone the title "Concrete Rose"

[Ashanti]
Concrete Rose because, like, when you think of hip-hop, you think of something grimy, grungy, kind of gritty. Concrete, when you think of R&B, you think of something soft, sensual, you know, kind of like a rose. My music is considered hip-hop and R&B, so hence, "Concrete Rose"
