[Hook: 700 & Ramzo]
No wonder we ain't got a love
We livin in strange days
Spend it all and we ain't got enough
We livin in strange days

[Ja Rule]
No me, no you, no us
We tried, we failed, what's love?
We fucked, you wanna lie
Man who I'm talking about names remain anonymous
Could it be her, could it be her? I'm like
What if it was, what if it was?
I got you intrigued, only because
My life is so strange, gets in-teresting
For all those that's interested
We gon' get into something intricate
The sex can get infamous
That all depends on just how strange it gets

[Hook]

[Ja Rule]
Love triangle, same circle
The square root to evil is virtues
Fresh shit for good dick, what's it worth to you?
Better question baby, how that work for you?
It's gotta be paranoia
To be a ghost to a good friend, paranormal
Knowing the road to the dead end's around the corner
Catch ends before you hanging and you Osama
Then smash in, head shots, no drama
And what goes around comes back, bitch, it's called karma
Boomerang, you ain't giving [?] marker
Should just forget it ever happened, Alzheimer's

[Hook x2]
