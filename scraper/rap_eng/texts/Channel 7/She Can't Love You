[Chorus]
Even though you wanted her to be me
Everything you wanted wasn't me, you see
That she can't love you
She can't love you
She can't love you
She can't love you
Like I love you
Like I love you

[Verse 1]
I see you over there with your new girlfriend
I bet you she can't put it down like I can
But you don't wanna let me go (go)
Don't wanna let me know (know)
Don't wanna let your feelings show (feelings show)
Well you see me over here with my new boyfriend (boyfriend)
And he knows how to love me like a real man
But I don't wanna let you go (go)
Don't wanna let you know (know)
Don't wanna let my feelings show
(Even though)

[Chorus]
Even though you wanted her to be me
(I know you wanted her to be me)
Everything you wanted wasn't me, you see (No)
That she can't love you
She can't love you
She can't love you (Baby)
She can't love you
Like I love you
Like I love you (No)

Even though you wanted her to be me
(I know you wanted her to be me)
Everything you wanted wasn't me, you see (It wasn't me)
That she can't love you
She can't love you
She can't love you (She can't love you)
She can't love you
Like I love you
Like I love you

[Verse 2]
I can see it in your eyes there's somethin' missin' (missin')
Maybe there's somethin' in the love that she has given (given)
But you don't wanna let me know (know)
Don't wanna let me go (go)
Don't wanna let your feelings show
(Even though)
Heaven knows I'm still in love with my man (still in love with my man)
But he can never love me the way you can (can)
That's why I'm never gonna let you go (go)
I'm about to let you know (know)
I'm about to let my feelings show, ohh

[Chorus]
Even though you wanted her to be me
(Even though you wanted her to be)
Everything you wanted wasn't me (she's not me), you see
That she can't love you
She can't love you
She can't love you
She can't love you
Like I love you
Like I love you
(Like I love you)

[Bridge]
Who am I kiddin'
I'm missing the love we shared
And I think I need you near
I can see it in your eyes
It ain't no surprise
That she can't love you like I
And I'm not about to let you slip away
Oh, she can't love you

[Chorus]
Even though you wanted her to be me
(Even though you wanted)
Everything you wanted wasn't me
(She wasn't me)
You see
That she can't love you
She can't love you
She can't love you
(She can't love you baby)
She can't love you
Like I love you
Like I love you
(Like I love you...)

Even though you wanted her to be me
(...I love you, I love you)
Everything you wanted wasn't me
(Even though you thought it, she ain't me)
You see
That she can't love you
She can't love you
She can't love you
(She can't love you baby)
She can't love you
Like I love you
Like I love you
(No, no, no, no)

[Outro]
I got everything you need
It's all inside of me
And she can't love you (she can't love you)
I'll show you love if you follow my lead
Because you know that she won't (she won't, she can't)
(Like I love you, like I love you)
