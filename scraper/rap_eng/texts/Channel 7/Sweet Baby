[Chorus: Ashanti]
My sweet baby
Come on, touch me, tease me
My sweet baby
Hold me, love me, need me
My sweet baby
Come on, touch me, tease me
My sweet baby
Gonna be just fine with my sweet baby

[Verse 1: Ashanti]
See, every time that I think of you
You make me feel so good
Do anything that you ask me to
Boy, you know I would
I just wanna be in your arms
Holding me, kissing me all night long
And I want you to know
That I'm your lady and you're my...

[Chorus: Ashanti]
My sweet baby
Come on, touch me, tease me
My sweet baby
Hold me, love me, need me
My sweet baby
Come on, touch me, tease me
My sweet baby
Gonna be just fine with my sweet baby

[Verse 2: Ashanti]
See, I don't care what nobody says
As long as you're with me
Forever you loving me
Is the way that it's gonna be
I just wanna spend all my time
With you, baby, you're, oh, so fine
And I want you to know
That I'm your lady and you're my...

[Chorus: Ashanti]
My sweet baby
Come on, touch me, tease me
My sweet baby
Hold me, love me, need me
My sweet baby
Come on, touch me, tease me
My sweet baby
Gonna be just fine with my sweet baby
