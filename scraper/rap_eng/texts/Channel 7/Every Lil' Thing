[Chorus]
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing you got for me
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing you got for me
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing you got for me
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing, every little thing, every little thing

[Verse 1]
Baby, from what you told me
You can give every little thing
And baby, from what you show me
Instead of going out, you can bring the world to me
See, I done had it all, had it all
And now I'm looking for more, I'm looking for more
So can you provide what's inside?
Can your heart match mine and give me....

[Chorus]
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing you got for me
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing you got for me
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing you got for me
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing, every little thing, every little thing

[Verse 2]
I'm just a girl that looks for
Nothing else but the best and more
And I don't think that I'll run
'Cause I just want to find somebody I can give my all
And all them other things, money, friends
It's nice to see, but it ain't enough for me
'Cause I would want all of you
And need you to love me too and give me

[Chorus]
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing you got for me
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing you got for me
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing you got for me
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing, every little thing, every little thing

[Bridge 1]
I ain't talking 'bout your money, baby
I ain't talking 'bout your cars and things
And I'm talking 'bout the love and things
And how you even make me say your name
I ain't talking 'bout your money, baby
I ain't talking 'bout your cars and things
And I'm talking 'bout the love and things
And how you even make me say your name

[Chorus]
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing you got for me
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing you got for me
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing you got for me
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing, every little thing, every little thing

[Bridge 2]
Can you give it to me, can you give it to me
Can you give it to me, can you give it to me
Can you give it to me, can you give it to me
Can you give it to me, can you give it to me

[Chorus]
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing you got for me
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing you got for me
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing you got for me
I want everything you got for me
Every little thing, every little thing, every little thing
