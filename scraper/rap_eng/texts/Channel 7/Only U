[Intro]
I just want you to know that throught out it all
It's only you that stuck by me
And for that, I thank you, I love you
Ashanti
(Ashanti!)

[Bridge]
Ooh, I can't wait to get next to you
Oh, I just can't leave you alone

[Verse 1]
Boy, you got me doing things that I would never do
And I can't stop the way I'm feeling if I wanted to
I'm crazy 'bout the way that you could make me say your name
And if I couldn't have you, I would probably go insane
'Cause

[Chorus]
Only you can make me feel
And only you can take me there
And only you can make me feel
And only you can take me there

[Bridge]
Ooh, I can't wait to get next to you
Oh, I just can't leave you alone

[Verse 2]
Boy, you stay inside my mind, ain't no denying that
And only you could do them things that got me coming back
It gotta be the realest thing that I have ever felt
And I'll do what I gotta do to keep you to myself
'Cause

[Chorus]
Only you can make me feel
And only you can take me there
And only you can make me feel
And only you can take me there

[Verse 3]
Crazy (crazy)
'Bout the ('bout the)
Way you (make me)
Feel
I just (I just)
Gotta (gotta)
Have you (have you)
Here
And I (and I)
Wanna (wanna)
Let you (let you)
Know
I won't (I won't)
Ever (ever)
Let you (let you)
Go

[Chorus]
Only you can make me feel
And only you can take me there
And only you can make me feel
And only you can take me there

[Outro]
Ooh, I can't wait to get next to you
Oh, I just can't leave you alone
