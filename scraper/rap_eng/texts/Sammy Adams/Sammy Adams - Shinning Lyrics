Your the type of the dance
till the night time though

I wounder if you'll play it of or just move
and don't you do ya

Seem so cool but I know you don't sleep well
Look what you dance away all our problems
Baby, you wanna stay, I'm sorry
I'm Gone

I got a ocean we can dive in
Or whips we can drive in
I take the world of yours
Show this girl, and hold it darling
And if they weren't lying
And pressure make a diamond
If I stand here long enough
Even though I know it might be rough
I'm Gone

Gonna be shining
Gonna be shining
Gonna be shining
Gonna be, gonna be
Gonna be shining
Gonna be shining
Gonna be shining

I'm the type of dude probably drink too much (I hate to admit)
But even when I'm sober if I seek you once (Still that crucial)
Feel so good till I see those eyes
Got you depressed from my socials
Open to terms I'd ever hope for

I got a ocean we can dive in
Or whips we can drive in
I take the world of yours
Show this girl, and hold it darling
And if they weren't lying
And pressure make a diamond
If I stand here long enough
Even though I know it might be rough
I'm Gone

Gonna be shining
Gonna be shining
Gonna be shining
Gonna be, gonna be
Gonna be shining
Gonna be shining
Gonna be shining

Gonna be shining
And if they weren't lying
And pressure make a diamond
If I stand here long enough
Even though I know it might be rough
I'm Gone
Gonna be shining
Gonna be shining
Gonna be shining
Gonna be, gonna be
Gonna be shining
Gonna be shining
Gonna be shining
