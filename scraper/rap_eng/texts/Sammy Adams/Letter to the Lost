(Chorus)
I know I can't take one more step towards you, cause all that's waiting is regret, and don't you know im not your ghost anymore, you lost the love I love the most

So, here's a story, of a boy sick with ambition, shit on since he was twelve, put down- not a soul would listen
From ground zero transitioned headlining to some local spots---
Jumped on a train and coasted just coasted til he composed his thoughts
Last stop on the one way train...can't see the station sign, so stuck on the chore in hand, to think of what he left behind
As the rain whipped off his face
Unknown to the part of town
No clue that the biggest change in his life was bout to come around
And for his boys and his family made sure he held em down
Never cared bout travelling, touring, he always made em proud
No ones opinions or comments could EVER make him doubt or regret
The choices or promises coming out his mouth

(Chorus)

I know I can't take one more step towards you, cause all that's waiting is your crys, and don't you know im not your ghost anymore, you lost the love I love the most

So he kept friends,that knew him before his alter ego, to help him read through the bullshit that he'd have to see thru
But the endless studio time and photoshoots THEY became the evils
And pulled him further and further away from all his equals, but still
He balanced well

Even when the kid kid was outta town
Dreaming like he never gotta out bed, but still made sure his records sell
Still made sure that all the hits, and with all the chicks he'd never dwell
Crazy how last years t-shirts turned into three piece suits wit a black lapel
Presidential suites with homies screaming what the hell?!!!!
It was just yesterday they wondered what theY future held
And the train he jumped on with a backpack, hope, and a poem to tell
Back that dream that a dope like he could do anything and everything
He told him self

(Chorus)
I know I can't take one more step towards you, cause all that's waiting is your crys, and don't you know im not your ghost anymore, you lost the love I love the most

Yeah young sammy with a fantasy, closed my eyes and took a path no one else had seen
Livin a life I had before theres nothing left to see. Onto the world to explore and free to breathe

It took so long just to feel alright, remember how to put back the lights in my eyes x3
