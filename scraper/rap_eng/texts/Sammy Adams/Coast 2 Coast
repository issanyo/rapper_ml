[Intro]
(Coast to coast, coast to coast)
Sammy Adams (Coast to Coast)
Coast to coast
(Coast to coast, coast to coast)

[Hook]
Lifestyle switching, the illest up in the business
I’m hoping to make a killing
Get at me, get at me
Going coast to coast
Going coast to coast
We going coast to coast
Coast to coast

[Verse 1]
I’m not being mean, I'm just being me
[?] Sinatra, get on my team
Girls see me say "OMG"
He’s back on flights going overseas
Not rich, but aspire to be
Got a new Bentley and my swagger cheese
Rather be an act with a pound of trees
Never been down and you cannot see
Girl problems, you think you had some
Hit the beach, you won’t have none
Big dream sale, you know platinum
Checks never deposit, just cash ‘em
Summertime, triple eight vodka
Going out with my boys, looking proper
Used to be at the bottom with the other lobsters
Now I’m in the sky like birds and helicopters

[Hook]
Lifestyle switching, the illest up in the business
I’m hoping to make a killing
Get at me, get at me
Going coast to coast
Going coast to coast
We going coast to coast
Coast to coast

[Verse 2]
On flights traveling to play songs
Two things, iPod and my Dre's on
Two things on my mind at the same time
Got to go both coasts on the same song
Gotta kill shit, no limit
I spit my heart out, cause it’s in this
And the bridges, the beginning
Yeah, something like the keys to my ignition
Come fly, yeah get a boarding pass
Too busy all day can’t go to class
Still getting good grades, know I’m gonna pass
Hit the West Coast, I’m leaving last
Domestic, got a press kit
Side life every girl's impressed with
Girls strutting like they won't have sex with me
Yeah right

[Hook]
Lifestyle switching, the illest up in the business
I’m hoping to make a killing
Get at me, get at me
Going coast to coast
Going coast to coast
We going coast to coast
Coast to coast
Lifestyle switching, the illest up in the business
I’m hoping to make a killing
Get at me, get at me
Going coast to coast
Going coast to coast
We going coast to coast
Coast to coast
