If you could see me now
If you could see me now
If you could see me now
If you could see me now
Yeah (but you can't)

Uh, If you could see me now
I'm drunk off love shit
Just got on a flight
I'm already feeling lovesick
Nah, no bullshit baby no corny rhymes
I ain't calling, texting you
"I love you" like forty times
You know I do, and if otherwise
Won't take advantage cause I know you catch a ton of eyes
Staying' patient when I'm vistin' the other side
Up in Vegas partying, I still call at night

Yeah, but you probably won't believe it
Cause all the dreams I have
My baby I'm achieving
And music's like breathing
So take a fresh breath
On top like sex
Yeah, the kid's up next

Cause baby I'm infatuated
By the way that you fascinate me
So crazy, got me on point now I have to make it
Give it to me I'mma gladly take it

Yeah, if you could see me now
Driving hard, no drop step needed
If you could see me now
I'm loving' life but they say I'm conceited
(If you could see me now) I told 'em once
But they didn't believe it
(If you could see me now) They didn't believe it, nope
They didn't believe it
If you could see me, you could see me now
Remember when it was just me and you
I remember when it was just me and you
I remember when it was just me and you, just just me and you
Just just me and you

If you could see me now
Poolside, with mommy on the right
She drove down from the city
Cause she doesn't like to fly
And anything she wants, she knows that I'm her guy
I'm Boston's own boy
(?) and reply
The sex game's proper
Sometimes we just lie
To think about the fact that we just happened to collide
And got to many feelings in the air open that I
Could ever fuck another girl or do one on the side
I can't, call it bein' locked down whipped
But I ain't got a problem bein' locked by my chick
So, text all you want if you're feenin' for a fix
Just the thought of losing your loving
Is worse than the Knicks

New York chillin'
Can't compare to the palm tree lifestyle
We see, or we be livin'
Niggtlifes chillin' with fresh clothes and my bros
Yeah you know we get it

(Chorus)
