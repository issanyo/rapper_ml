[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'll make your knees shake
She a factory with that cheesecake
But I, but I've never been a cheapskate
How much bass do we need for a [?]?
Left a mp3 for a [?]
So when you wake up and you can't see straight
Try the USB by the briefcase
To the wall, yeah, bang it for a week straight
And we weak straight, I mean we straight
Had a good run, got it with a clean break
Been so up, smoking loud
Bought another hoe chick to the hotel
Like oh shit, this hoe shit
Going HAM to the sound of my own shit
If I fall down, there's no point in saving me
No saving me cause I'm over it
(Cause I'm over it)

[Chorus]
I'm on the upper deck
I'm going overboard
No point in saving me
I'll be safe when I hit the shore
I just don't wanna feel like I'm ever coming down, down, down
All day, I've been figuring this the hard way
No one ever loves
It's just a heartache
It's just a heartbreak
So move on, cause I'm gone
We fall, so long

[Post-Chorus - Instrumental]
So long, I'm gone
So long
So, so long

[Verse 2]
Low-key, night, word
Trying to dance to it boutta hit an iceberg
Our crew shit, got a few tips
Just one if you're looking for some new dick
[?] seem off your bright
Dress on, yupp, seem awful tight
So address it if I'm wrong, but I'm all for right
No panties under what you rock tonight
God damn girl
Bout to go on command though cause you commando
No scandal
I'm an animal, so imma jump on in like a cannibal
Two hands involved with the camera on
Walk in, mmm hmm, wonder why the pants are gone
I forget everything I ever say
[?]

[Chorus]
I'm on the upper deck
I'm going overboard
No point in saving me
I'll be safe when I hit the shore
I just don't wanna feel like I'm ever coming down, down, down
All day, I've been figuring this the hard way
No one ever loves
It's just a heartache
It's just a heartbreak
So move on, cause I'm gone
We fall, so long

[Post-Chorus - Instrumental]
So long, I'm gone
So long

[Bridge]
I'm on the upper deck
I'm going overboard
No point in saving me
I'll be safe when I hit the shore
I just don't wanna feel like I'm ever coming down, down, down, dow-own

[Chorus]
I'm on the upper deck
I'm going overboard
No point in saving me
I'll be safe when I hit the shore
I just don't wanna feel like I'm ever coming down, down, down
All day, I've been figuring this the hard way
No one ever loves
It's just a heartache
It's just a heartbreak
So move on, cause I'm gone
We fall, so long
