[Verse 1]
I know you miss me anyway
Didn't mean to say it when I was on your speaker phone
If you miss me then that's okay (If you miss me then that's okay)
Some things you can't make up

[Hook]
I've been on the road for a week now
Some things you can't change
Some things that I want
Never come into play
And you know that it's all love
It's never gone change
You know it's always love
As long as I play the game

[Chorus]
We don't hold any grudges
And nobody judging
You're so close to erupting, you're so hot right now
I used to feel I was nothing
You made me feel like I'm something
Now you get me off the ground, get me off the ground

[Verse 2]
Who are you to say I'm gone?
Who are you to say it's different this time around?
Who are you to say I'm lost?
Now for nothing I'm loving
That's something that you always do

[Hook]
I've been on the road for a week now
Some things you can't change
Some things that I want
Never come into play
And you know that it's all love
It's never gone change
You know it's always love
As long as I play the game

[Chorus]
We don't hold any grudges
And nobody judging
You're so close to erupting, you're so hot right now
I used to feel I was nothing
You made me feel like I'm something
Now you get me off the ground, get me off the ground

[Verse 3]
Who are you to tell me off?
I know someone, somewhere, had clearly just led you wrong
Who are you to call it off?
I know somewhere, someone, had clearly just led you wrong

[Hook]
I've been on the road for a week now
Some things you can't change
Some things that I want
Never come into play
And you know that it's all love
It's never gone change
You know it's always love
As long as I play the game

[Chorus]
We don't hold any grudges
And nobody judging
You're so close to erupting, you're so hot right now
I used to feel I was nothing
You made me feel like I'm something
Now you get me off the ground, get me off the ground

Get me off the ground (x8)
