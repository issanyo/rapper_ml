[Intro]
We can go the long way, oh
Find our way home
We can go along, we can go along
Till we find our way back

[Chorus]
We can go the long way, oh
Find our way back home
Even if it's so cold
Find our way back
We can go the long way, oh
Find our way home
We can go along, we can go along
Till we find our way back
We can go the long way, oh
Find our way home
We can go along, we can go along
Till we find our way back

[Verse 1]
I know you're lonely every time I leave
Is it a broken heart if it doesn't bleed?
We're still by the journey was
Live now in the reason time
Cold nights, yeah we had a few
Never get another if it wasn't for you
Rather have my blood turn blue
My whole crew too
I swear it's all true
I, I should've seen the betrayal comin'
All the lights and the questions to the trails runnin'
Might come back just to find you
Hope running out second time, too
Oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Imma keep fighting, keep pushing
You gon' keep hiding
Imma keep looking
Oh, I'ma keep looking
Till we find our way back home

[Chorus]
We can go the long way, oh
Find our way home
We can go along, we can go along
Till we find our way back
We can go the long way, oh
Find our way back home
Even if it's so cold, oh oh
Find our way back
We can go the long way, oh
Find our way home
We can go along, we can go along
Till we find our way back

[Verse 2]
I saw my tide in the rest of us
Tell me how the weather is
I'm being a liar if I said I was
To forget about all the things that we did
I'm trying annoy you with the things you like
But haven't got a bite since
I'd right be by myself rather then go through hell
I know you too well
Oh, I'd be letting my anger get the best of me
No one in the end to be the death of me
Pushing but forget about em [?]
Know for a while you were gasoline
It messes me, what you read about?
Right back, I'm not the crazy one that's getting out
Zero fucks given 'bout the past though
This time I feel, no [?] asshole
Too much, too overbearing
Or do you care too much about what you've been hearing?
And when it all falls and it's all right
Would you be around for the whole night?

[Chorus]
We can go the long way, oh
Find our way home
We can go along, we can go along
Till we find our way back
We can go the long way, oh
Find our way back home
Even if it's so cold, oh oh
Find our way back
We can go the long way, oh
Find our way home
We can go along, we can go along
Till we find our way back
We can go the long way, oh
Find our way home
We can go along, we can go along
Till we find our way back
