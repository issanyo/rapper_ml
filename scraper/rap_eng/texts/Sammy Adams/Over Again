Eh eh eh
She say eh eh eh
Over again

I got a feeling that we ain’t gonna sleep
Got a couple bitches comin’ to the penthouse suite
Feel like there’s no one above us cause the last few weeks
Been a blast but the future feel like cashmere seats
So damn, how you gonna describe these songs?
Like chess, watch a rook move up and down these pawns
Cutting heavy over here, go get your own damn lawn
The man in top 40, get your goddamn ha
12 hours in Vegas, popped out in the papers
So poppin’ that PDs at me on every pop station
This song, pack your bags, life’s about to be a video
Slappin’ model asses hoola hoopin’ with Cheerios
Make sure the Betty and cutie with a backside
Mid field, guess who’s playin’ on that halftime
Yeah, and it’s gon be the best damn night
Stop thinkin’ that you’re dreamin’, this is goddamn life

Okay (kay) and baby we know (know)
That at the end of the day (day) we’ll be covered in gold (gold)
Know it’s alright (right) and everything cool (cool)
[CMG??] over everything you know thats the crew (crew)
Saying over and over again
Over again
Over again
She said play it over and over again
Over again
Over again
Over again
She say eh eh eh
She say eh eh eh
Over again

Thank God music saved me from a desk job
Cuz right now at the moment I have the best job
So baby ditch the wagon, join the fuckin’ band
Leave your boyfriend at the crib come join the fuckin’ man
Ya and I got a fat check waiting
Cuz I’m making songs pop like the grease on bacon
Skinny white boy, why your fat neck hatin’?
And then I’m comin’ for your spot, even a whole lot bakin’
If I if I if I if I ever fall
Y’all crazy I did this shit without any help at all
I’m well from cutting records in my room to killin’ hoes
Getting out of snow pussy, fuckin’ bitches in the store
Ball so hard got tears in my eyes
Fizz under influence like open beers in the ride
International money, got my gears on my grind
So just a piece of advice, if you ain’t on don’t even try to forget get
