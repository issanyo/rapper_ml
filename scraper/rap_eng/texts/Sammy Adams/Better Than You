Uh Huh I’m better than who?
I’m better than you, I'm better than you, uhh uhh
Samuel Adams
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I’m better than you
I’m better than who?
I’m better than you
Yup better than you and your whole crew
That’s true, that dude rockin’ some black shoes
Or a pair of Jordan’s you ain't never seen around you
Who cares
Like my belongings are so appalling
But listen to my story its short yet it’s alarming
I went from no shows to hoes calling my charming
Unbuttoning my pants searching without a warrant
And I can't stop can’t catch me
You can’t even break me running harder than an athlete
Girls sitting up on my lap mistake this for a track meet
I’m just X5’in, highway, pass me
With black rims and give your crew the business
Stay catchin up brains like I’m in Harvard on the crimson
Confidence is honesty and modest is my mission
Juggling a 3.3, my GPA’s Pippen (scholar)
O I get it, nope I don’t need your details
Talents over your head manager’s don’t want your emails
I’m better than you and when it’s said and done right
I’m be like I told you so and dammit ima love life
I’m better than you
I’m better than who?
I’m better than you
Yup better than you and your whole crew
That’s true, that dude rockin’ some black shoes
Or a pair of Jordan’s you ain't never seen around you
Stop the show the crowd dome’s getting blown back
Cause the headliner ain’t half as nice as the opening act (Wiz)
They want an encore yup they wanna send me back
Skinny is the new success you my dude at getting phat
And I don’t care if you got fans that can sing along
It’s easy to steal hooks and then go make a song
But I’m shameless too nice and I’ll be famous
But I guess it’s proven that two rights can’t make a wrong
And all the pressure one man can’t take it all
But I bring them white caps when the fuckin ocean come
And the way I been treated ya I got hella qualms
See I'm the best but they won't see the truth til later on
Like Mr. Adams can’t kick out with a blindfold
Covering’ both eye holes
Tell me something’ I don’t know know know
I just wonder where the time goes
Music is my brain and I’m just tryin to get my mind blown
I’m better than you
I’m better than who?
I’m better than you
Yup better than you and your whole crew
That’s true, that dude rockin’ some black shoes
Or a pair of Jordan’s you ain't never seen around you
I'm gon’ shine stupid
Dis and yes it’s Sammy Adams
My boys in the cabin puffin Lucky sippin madness
So come fly with me
Cruise or drive wish you had it
Heard my shit when I was Wiz
Just signed out at you’re my dick
Uh Huh I’m better than who?
I’m better than you, I'm better than you, uhh uhh
