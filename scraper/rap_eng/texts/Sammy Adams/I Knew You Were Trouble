[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Once upon time
A few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone
You found me
You found me
You found meeeeee
I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me, without me, without meeeee
And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Hook: Taylor Swift]
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 2: Sammy Adams]
Double platinum wherever she go
Shout to French Torino
Met her out Met her out in Vegas
I'm not in no casino
Red lips so hard to miss
What's wrong with being promiscuous
And I can teach you bad bad things
If you into it
Don't need to get intimate
Just yet
Slow down I know that you're thinking you and me
Just met
But girl I got the remedy
Most important the chemistry
Good girl gone bad
Too much for a Kennedy
So, some say some say they sold their souls for a couple hits
I'd rather live the life of gold with the perfect chick
Cause that one moment so breathless and you're hoping
That you'll feel the same way same way
Sparks glowing off that cute face and that sharp smile
Oh man
I haven't crushed this hard in quite awhile
Oh dang
And I could care less that you famous
We gon' make the perfect couple
Cause my first name Big
Last name Trouble

[Hook]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

When your sadest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble!
