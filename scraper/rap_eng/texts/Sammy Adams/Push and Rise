[Hook: Wolfgang Gartner]
Loving and living and fighting and falling and flying
Growing and playing and praying and pushing and rising

[Verse 1: Sam Adams]
Let's meet, it's best that you're timely
How you ahead, but two steps behind me?
You a jet, I'm a 747, hard to hide, but I bet you still won't find me
Thank y'all, for making this possible
Lively up in this bitch, no gossip girl
Amex in her system, pop it girl
9 months, see me now, I'm on top the world
I'm getting better every second, minute, month, year, big bags yeah check it
Love seeing a man turn fan from a skeptic
Start trends and watch rap bands go electric
Cause all I ever wanted was a chance
Took a card with a question mark, and I ran
Monopolize mine, like a wise old man
Through it all, fuck the odds, baby I'm gon' dance
Push and rise cause I'm up there
Pray to God cause the sun clear
But I still love life as I'm flying through the air
When I'm playing, never stuck here
So I still got to push and rise
Even if it's only for a couple more nights
Fighting through the bass like the song's my wife
Give them an idea how we do this like

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sam Adams]
It's difficult when these beats dry up
No honey, no money, and the fees pile up
Wonder if the buzz that peeps rile up
Is worth making your dreams in your genes line up
That's, negative fame to see what I was born with
Everybody's watching, life's just a porn clip
I don't stop, I won't 'til I'm on it
I love beats, let's rock 'til the morning
I'm getting better by the bar
Beat length and measure, too high for the stars
Ego, never, just finding the calls
To make new music, without no flaws
Please, don't ever press pause
Cause as you can tell, the crowds do applaud
Everything we doing on stage and beyond
Break 'em off a piece of that shit that we on
Push and rise cause I'm up there
Pray to God cause the sun clear
But I still love life as I'm flying through the air
When I'm playing, never stuck here
So I still got to push and rise
Even if it's only for a couple more nights
Fighting through the bass like the song's my wife
Give them an idea how we do this like
