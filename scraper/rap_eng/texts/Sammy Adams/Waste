[Intro]
Don’t let it go to waste
Go to waste
Go to waste
Go to waste
Don’t let it go to waste

[Verse 1: Sammy Adams]
Oh yeah, yeah
I say life’s what you make it
Whether you working nights or day shift
Extra money on the side as a waitress
While you go to school, tryna keep your grades straight
You a dropout
Never fit in with the crowd, getting cropped out
In every picture that your quote on quote friends post on Facebook
A Twitter or whatever they on
And it’s no wonder why you feel alone
Parents moved so much you never had a home
Just tune out the world, you can turn me on
Know, I’m just here for you for a couple songs
Know, I’m just here for you for a couple songs
So tell me what your pain is
Being you what defined you as a great kid
It’s the easy way out so go get wasted
But if you get a chance to change don’t waste it

[Hook]
Every day
That you wanna change
And break away
And break away
Every day ay ay
That you get faded
While they get famous
It’s also takin it

Don’t let it go to waste
Go to waste
Go to waste
Go to waste
Don’t let it go to waste

[Verse 2: Sammy Adams]
You gon wake up on the right side
Instead of lookin back you lookin for the bright side
Oh you got a good look from a bad chick
And some other shit that you didn’t expect to happen
See the point of the story kid is to dream big
You never know what’s gonna be there when the saints wakes
Could be you on a soldout stage
Just the fans that raise anything you say
I’m talkin to everybody in the world
Who’s ever been scared of reach
Who’s ever been scared of girls
Who’s ever been scared of boys
I’m talkin to all of yall
Telling you stay true, I’m telling you stand tall
‘Cause all it takes is one move to be on your way
Whether you’re tall, fat, skinny, pretty, straight or gay
Seems easy to say fuck it and get wasted
But if you get a chance to change don’t waste it

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You got caught off a good thing
Get a job, just becoming something routine
And you feel like the whole world hates
But it’s something that your soul can’t fix so
Take a deep breath, take a step back
Know you good as long as you can get past
All the pressure but it’s close til you taste it
But if you get a chance to change don’t waste it

[Hook]
