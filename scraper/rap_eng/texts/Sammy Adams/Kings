[Verse 1: Sammy Adams]
My throne is my desk chair, phone’s my assistant
I don’t need a servant ‘cause Sammy runs the business
Highrise my castle, queen is my vixen
T-shirt’s my robes unless they non-existent
Fans are my glow, chucks are my loafers
Honesty’s the code and honestly I roast ya
Skateboard’s my chariot, fans are proletariat
The stable’s a sorority, homies are hilarious
Kingdom stages, royal means so famous
Loyal to my fans so I only put out bangers
Jail is a dungeon, my workout’s Runyon
And twerking is illegal but tonight, ah, fuck it

[Hook]
We don’t care about your money and your flashy things
Rather stay young, live like some kings
We are, we are
We are, we are
She don’t care about your money and your flashy things
Rather stay young, live like a Queen
We are, we are
We are, we are

[Verse]
Life is my fairytale, my boys are my army
My chamber see scary tale, yours? Hardly
Young kings, purple in the ales
My game’s like a witch just like a witch’s cool spells
New clothes on a emperor, birthday suit
My worst day is the best day, my work days too
Consists of being rich, not rich like mad riches
Rich like good fam, good friends and bad bitches

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Hat is my crown, my queen’s ass round
In terms of executions I be killin it in town
They say these are clowns but we are the kings
And we are the queens, that’s a royal ass team
And Lord is the boss, made it cross the board
Untouched so listen pretty king we over month
Worries or advice, Lord is it nice
And never kick twice and live life like…

[Hook]
