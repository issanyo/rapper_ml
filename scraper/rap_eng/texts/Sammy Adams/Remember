[Verse 1]
Look how far you done came, Just from screaming your name
Just from being yourself, well how fast did it change
When we started from Mom's, man those days were the bomb
Never set no alarm, never thought we'd be on
Went from panning my name, when november never came
It was cold in the streets and my records were flame
So from chasing the cash and now watching my ass
I got burned from the same flame I lit with a match
Took some advice I should've passed on
Should have put another album on the fire
Left the mother fucking gas on, break got smash off
Make mistakes, make sure the shake you give 'em gonna leave
With a cast on

[Hook]
Took the pain in my hand, I took the knives on my back
Been writing home for a while,  I always get something back
And now I'm back on this tracks, and they gon' loved it, loved it
BBSG nothing above it
(Above it)
Love it when I'm back hate it when I'm gone
Miss me on the track, back where I belong
And I know you love it (love it, love it)
And I know you love it (love it...)
Hate it when I’m gone, love it when I’m back
Back where I belong, right back on the track
And I know you love it (love it, love it)
And I know you love it (love it...)

(Love it), Make them love it
(Love it), Make them love it

[Verse 2]
Oh but fuck it it's cool, I ain’t holding no grudge
Never paying attention when they're paying too much
I tried moving a mountain but that shit wouldn't budge
Only God has the gavel,, I'd be stupid to judge
The whole point of the story, I've been trying to say
Life is a fucking bitch but she's delighted to stay
And if yo' ain't proactive, you might as well wrap it
Send the crew home, get the bags, start packing
Drop another pop song, crossover
Smash record, no message left
Exact just like we got one, only thing that matters
In long run is the fans, and judging by the show of hands who’s the fucking man

[Hook]
I took a pen in my hand, I took the knives on my back
Been writing home for a while,  I always get something back
And now I'm back on this tracks, and they gon' loved it, loved it
BBSG nothing above it
(Above it...)

Love it when I'm back, hate it when I'm gone
Miss me on the track, back where I belong
And I know you love it, (love it, love it)
And I know you love it (love it...)
Hate it when I’m gone, love it when I’m back
Back where I belong, right back on the track
And I know you love it (love it, love it)
And I know you love it (love it...)

(Love it), Make them love it
(Love it), Make them love it

[Outro]
Love it when I'm back, hate it when I'm gone
Miss me on the track, back where I belong
And I know you love it (love it, love it)
And I know you love it (love it...)
Hate it when I'm gone, Love it when I'm back
Back where I belong, right back on the track
And I know you love it (love it, love it)
And I know you love it (love it...)
