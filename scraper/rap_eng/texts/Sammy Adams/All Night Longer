[Verse 1]
In Vegas, yeah I drink JÃ¤ger
Throw bangers, get serenaded by ladies basically naked
It's crazy this life I take it
Everybody notice, white girls drink Vodka Sodas
Jack and cokes will get you open, tequila shots are the dopest
And I love it, the way you look so fine when I'm faded on my 10 gin and tonic
But keep on getting persuaded that I wanna crack a Jameson
Invite all your lady friends, tell that bartender serve a mothafuckin' round again

[Hook]
Tell that bartender make that motherfucker stronger
I wanna go all night longer
A couple rounds going down like water
I wanna go all night longer
Cause I do this every night
I wanna do this every night
A couple rounds going down like water
I wanna go all night longer!

[Verse 2]
Negronis for all my homies
Titos and chasers only
Whisky straight for the lonlies
Tequlias, red whine and Stoli's
Yeah I mix it, yeah I mix it
Have some beers before this liquor
Now I'm shit-faced at the bar but my games never been sicker
Shoot whiskey like a cowboy
Both guns go off then we wild boys
Got a light skinned girl, sit tall boys
Jump around get loud make some mad noise
Gun natty ice like a college kid
So many girls, come and grab one bitch
Toast to the bars, toast to the broads
Ha! no wonder why you love this shit!

[Hook]
Tell that bartender make that motherfucker stronger
I wanna go all night longer
A couple rounds going down like water
I wanna go all night longer
Cause I do this every night
I wanna do this every night
A couple rounds going down like water
I wanna go all night longer!

[Interlude]
My game's never been sicker
And I love it
And I love it
And I love it
And I love it

[Hook]
Tell that bartender make that motherfucker stronger
I wanna go all night longer
A couple rounds going down like water
I wanna go all night longer
Cause I do this every night
I wanna do this every night
A couple rounds going down like water
I wanna go all night longer!
