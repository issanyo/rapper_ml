[Intro]
Right where you are
Ya ya ya
Right where you are

[Verse 1]
I never asked I just took it
(I just took it)
Still haven’t told them where I put it
(where I put it now)
Offers came through, No this ain't new
My agents double that and book it
Anyway, they MIA
But the juice on the trilly now
Tell the truth used to hate it but you feel me now
Here me steppin on the sidewalk, knockin pavement
I can’t, I can’t get involved if their ain't no payment
So you can be the judge yeah
And the defense and the jury and plaintiff
Cuz I could give fuck yeah
I could give a fuck less

[Chorus]
But you try prove
Or if you tryin to make it
Do what you do
I know I don’t do basic
Good bye to slow money
Hello to show money
I leave you right where you are, right where you are
Right where you are x3
I leave you right where you are

[Verse 2]
I never ask tell em book it
(tell em book it)
I'm shoot straight never crooked
(I'm never crooked no)
I keep it low key, got so much green
Fuck I don’t know where to put it
Both kinds, on the way
But the crib look silly now
(silly now)
Competition on blaze through the city now
(Through the city now)
Here me floatin down the west side
Chopper dangerous
I been ridin on the cost since I born in Cambridge
They say pesos me
More fades, more X,Y,Z
So I could really give a fuck less
(Fuck less)
I don’t give a fuck yeah
(Fuck yeah)



[Chorus]
What you tryin to prove
Or you tryin to make it
Do what you do
Yea I don’t do basic
Good bye to slow money
Hello to show money
I leave you right where you are, right where you are
Right where you are x3
I leave you right where you are

[Outro]
Right where you are
Don’t need to afar
I just need to be right where you are
Not afar, where you are, where you are

Right where you are x4
I leave you right where you are
