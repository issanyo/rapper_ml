[Verse]
So I'm pe-pe-peelin' down a highway racer
All about timing and I know I just missed ya
Sometimes karma clips you well, but the past moves on
Won't forget, too much to lose at this point
Wanna shootâ€“ well, be my guest, I

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go, flex mode
Over everything, can't let go
I was gonna make it harder
Down with the chase [?]
Party ain't over
And nobody leavin'
Tryna' steal you, so
Better not believe that

[Chorus]
It's a game
Like it's a game
Just don't ever think that it's a game
No no, it's not a game
Don't ever think that it's a game
It's a game
That it's a
It's a
Don't ever think that it's a game

[Verse 2]
Beat beatin' on my chest, you know it's on, no
I've been doin' fine, you remind me I was wrong, no
All time, you've been missing out when you come find, when you come find
Everything you've been missing
It'll only take a minute
Of your time
Feels right
Just know if you wanna play
Look it's not fine to start a game
Like it's a game
Just don't ever think that

[Chorus]
It's a game
Like it's a game
Just don't ever think that it's a game
No no, it's not a game
Don't ever think that it's a game
It's a game
That it's a
It's a
Don't ever think that it's a game
