[Hook: Sammy Adams]
You think you sold us a dream
We are the ones, we won't run
We don't need things that money can buy, standing in line
You think you sold us a dream (ooh-woah-oh)
We're not the ones, we won't run
So aim it at me
When you load up that gun, load up that gun

[Verse 1: Sammy Adams]
Black coat, dark horse
Long nights, pop cult
Can't stop, we won't stop
Load 'em up, encore
Pen can't write
When the deal ain't right, the feel ain't right
Something in the air, seeing all these flags
Color of the blood that be on this cash
Run the coast and we shoot the moon
Underdogs, come join the crew
Bring your girl, bring your friends too
No bad news, just tattoos
On to something, we on the move
Hit you up for that rendezvous
Time is now and you gotta choose
Us or them and that's up to you

[Hook: Sammy Adams]
You think you sold us a dream
We are the ones, we won't run
We don't need things that money can buy, standing in line
You think you sold us a dream (ooh woah oh)
We're not the ones, we won't run
So aim it at me
When you load up that gun, load up that gun
For the dark horse

[Verse 2: Sammy Adams]
Midnight, got racked out
Wide eyes and I'm blacked out
Fire sign can't back out
Just not me, just not allowed
Playing with the big boys
Gotta be a step ahead, see the big pic
Before you sign anything
Better make sure, make sure
Your attorney read the whole shit, gotta know shit
We load 'em up
We on that frontline
They sell you dreams, but this team is your only lifeline
Run the coast, come shoot the moon
Underdogs, come join the crew
Rock with me and I'll ride for you
Die for me, and I'll die for you

[Hook: Sammy Adams]
You think you sold us a dream
We are the ones, We won't run
We don't need things that money can buy, standing in line
You think you sold us a dream (ooh-woah-oh)
We're not the ones, We won't run
So aim it at me
When you load up that gun, load up that gun
For the dark horse

[Pre-Hook: Sammy Adams]
You think you sold us a dream (ooh-woah-oh)
We're not the ones, we won't run
So aim it at me (ooh-woah-oh)
We're not the ones, we won't run
For the dark horse

[Hook: Sammy Adams]
You think you sold us a dream
We are the ones, we won't run
We don't need things that money can buy, standing in line
You think you sold us a dream (ooh-woah-oh)
We're not the ones, we won't run
So aim it at me
When you load up that gun, load up that gun
For the dark horse
