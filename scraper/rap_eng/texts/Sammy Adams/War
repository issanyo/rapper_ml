[Verse 1]

East-coast, so my girls got a brave heart
But if I go on the defensive I could pay for it
Angel on my shoulder, devil on the other
Suppose to make a decision
I'm still trying to come up with like...
Hmm...You call her back
Na that's not cool
Cuz I'm just trying to kicking off with the main crew
But I'ma be smart, you know I'ma go in
A couple assist cuz you know she got friends

[Hook]

I'ma
Skip work
Go home
Get faded
Come back
Real, hit her round 7 or 8 all right
Oo yea don't lift just get lifted
Find smoke rings blowing an Olympus

[Chorus]

Ooo crazy,I can dance a bit more
If making a mistake means war
War(2x)
Waaar, War
Ooo crazy, I don't need your shields
Or help on the battlefield
War, This War we in
War, War

[Verse 2]

I'm on the west-coast, out in Venice just chilling
Barley 3 O'Clock so definitely ain't drinking
It's a warming 'erbs, and my girls on my last one
Even with the curves, there's always another bad one
I got a motor around my crib with a draw bridge
So I don't see her when she comes around to start shit
She probably got surveillance on me right now
But I move in silence, come to find out

[Hook]

I'ma
Skip work
Go home
Get faded
Come back
Real, hit her round 7 or 8 all right
Oo yea don't lift just get lifted
Find smoke rings blowing an Olympus

[Chorus]

Ooo crazy,I can dance a bit more
If making a mistake means war
Round me
(oooo) War round me
War, war
Ooo crazy, I don't need your shields
Or help on the battlefield
(ooooo)
War, This War we in
War, War

[Bridge]

You can never go in
Not against me
I only leave wit victories.(2x)
You can never go in
Not against me
I only leave wit victories

[Chorus]

Ooo crazy,I can dance a bit more
If making a mistake means war
Round me
(oooo) War round me
War, war
Ooo crazy, I don't need your shields
Or help on the battlefield
Round me (ooooo)
War, This War we in
War, War
