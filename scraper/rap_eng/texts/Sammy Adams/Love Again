[Verse 1: Sammy Adams]
Yeah, you make these other women look decent
I've been, I've been cuffed take me to the prison
I ain't trynna lose the only thing that I believe in
But when that pain comes, that's when that brain comes
I know a picture's worth a thousand words
A couple girls make you use a lot of vocal verbs
I ain't used to lyin'
You ain't used to cryin'
But as long as you tryin'
Why the fuck are we out here

[Pre-Chorus: Sammy Adams]
I'm just doing what I want to
Don't care what you're drinking right now
'Cause I'm living like I ought to

[Chorus: Madison Love and Sammy Adams]
Tell me you'll love, tell me you'll try
Pickup the pieces, this is the reason
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
Tell you I'm done, told you I lied
Rip me to pieces, remember the reason
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
In love again
Love again
Love again
Swore I'd never love again
Swore I'd never love, swore I'd never love
Love again
Love again
Swore I'd never love again

[Verse 2: Sammy Adams]
Yeah, I swear it's my fault 'til I call your bluff
Having stepped in a couple, I'm lookin' kinda rough
I just flew out to Austin, off the tour bus so I can meet you in Boston
It's on Baby
My commitment just turned into somethin' different
You busy trynna talk when I needed someone to listen, uh
All these nights turn to long days
Guess these shortcuts cut me off a long way away

[Pre-Chorus: Sammy Adams]
I'm just doing what I want to (what I want to)
Don't care what you're drinking right now (oh, what you're drinking right now)
'Cause I'm livin' like I ought to

[Chorus: Madison Love]
Tell me you'll love, tell me you'll try
Pickup the pieces, this is the reason
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
Tell you I'm done, told you I lied
Rip me to pieces, remember the reason
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
In love again
Love again
Swore I'd never love again
Love again
Swore I'd never love again

[Verse 3: Sammy Adams and Madison Love]
Yeah, I guess the feeling is what makes it work
And the role that you were playing, feeling so reversed
Everybody sees the outside, never lookin' in
Always wonderin' if it's 'bout time to give it in
Never get to see the love
Never really see what's up
Never really give a fuck, no, no
I mean if things go from bad to worse
I guess we know that what we had was cursed
And blame love again
Blame love again

[Chorus: Sammy Adams and Madison Love]
Tell me you'll love, tell me you'll try
Pickup the pieces, this is the reason
I'm falling in love again
I'm fallin' in love
I'm falling in love again
I'm fallin' in love
Tell you I'm done, told you I lied
Rip me to pieces, remember the reason
I'm falling in love again
I'm fallin' in love
I'm falling in love again
I'm fallin' in love

[Bridge: Sammy Adams]
Tell me you'll love, tell me you'll try
Pickup the pieces, this is the reason
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
Tell you I'm done, told you I lied
Rip me to pieces, remember the reason
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again

[Chorus: Both]
Tell me you'll love, tell me you'll try
Pickup the pieces, this is the reason
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
Tell you I'm done, told you I lied
Rip me to pieces, remember the reason
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again

[Outro: Sammy Adams]
In love again
Love again
Swore I'd never love again
Love again
Swore I'd never love again
Just tell me you'll try
Love again
Love again, again
Told you I'd love again
