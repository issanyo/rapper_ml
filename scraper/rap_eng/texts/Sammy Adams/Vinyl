(Verse 1)
Catch me out in Santa Rini
Bad bitches and lamborghinis
Eatin' proper on some tortellini
Y'all ain't even on it, y'all can never see me
Oh oh
She wax you like a record and you'll never know
And when she do (and when she do-o-o)
She spinning spiraling down, it's out of control

(Chorus)
Spin it like a vinyl, vinyl
Spin it like a vinyl, a vinyl
She be on that ??
??
Vinyl, vinyl (2x)

(Verse 2)
Posted up in Costa Rica
I pulled up in that nice to meet ya (nice to meet ya sir)
Skipping countries, I don't need no visa (I don't need no visa tho)
Y'all ain't even on it, you can never see me
Oh,oh
See I do shit my way or it ain't happening
So when I go (so when I go-o-o)
She wax me one more time like I ain't never been

(Chorus)
