Running through a motherfucking check, we gon' blow that
Drip too heavy from the [?], can't control that

D. Woke pulling up in a foreign again
Gucci belt around my head, I'm starting a trend
On my way to the moon, I never descend
I ain't taking L's but I'm making M's
Iced out chain ease my pain
All up in your bitches head like a migraine
She looked me in the eye and your heart sank
Cause I'm dripping like outside of a shark tank

Got your bitch hopping on my dick like a rabbit

Pull up in the Ghost, all these fans going rabid
Whole world gon' watch like Truman
Saying that you rich bitch prove it

Shark in the water like I'm Mark Cuban
