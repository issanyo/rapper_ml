[Verse 1]
I'm a Ace on the river, not playing cards
Alcohol and reefer that's some A and R
None flyer, fans the messiah
Got your hands up now I say jump higher
Boston's boy, awesome noise
Wanna battle it'll cost ya boy, accost ya boy
Fuck singing and promo, got my mojo back
Vision back like rolos on a rojo, yeah
Fucked up, trying find the exit
Said she loved pearls, I gave her a pearl necklace
Not the jewelry, stop the tomfoolery
Tom Ford cologne that I spend on when she do to me
I'm sure you're one of those guys that's really nice
And we fuck and you vanish at night it's not right
Well, in and out girl I got my own agenda
I'll go animal style, I bartend my own menu


[Hook]
I came to get fucked up
Came to jump, well it's just your luck
I know, I know how to make ya'll jump
I know, I know just what ya'll want
Put your hands up, now I say jump higher
J-j-jump higher, jump higher
Got your hands up, now I say jump higher, j-j-jump higher


[Verse 2]
Plus these chickies don't love me anymore
After my pants sag down  to the floor
Pants back up til' my waist belt secure
The walk back was out the motherfucking door
Damn, he's back at it, Sammy's back at it
Rewind the song, like Nas I'm still mad at
Mr. Pragmatic, Nas I'm Illmatic
Rewind the song cuz Sammy's back at it ho
Poker face, three eighths, but don't gamble
Almost passed out from killing the whole handle
More pain, Rambo, we're both commando
Knowing that she on it but she know she does it rando
Girl wanna mack and if you don't see
I'm just tryna get some jobs like my name is Steve
Ay say DJ in wholesale or hotel
Even if you don't let me hit, disappointed we don't tell


[Hook]


[Verse 3]
Dang king, that's feign, that's so devilish
Kill my vibe, almost as hard as Kendrick did
I'm a sinner, I'm a born bread-winner
I probably do you again right after we finish dinner, ho
Who are you to judge?  You don't know the kid
Always at my front door, some Jehovah shit
Witness, my dick is, your fitness
Can't fit this, ridiculous, delicious
Yeah that's the fucking business
You're 19 acting like you on some older shit
Always at the same clubs with promoter kids
Only place I go to is the studio or homie's crib
And I be out in NYC  to LA and you know this shit
Sending girl emojis, while she giving me blow-j's
She went 24, she the east coast Kobe
Just the tip, playing just the tip isn't playing hard to get
We both know I'm gon' hit


[Hook]
