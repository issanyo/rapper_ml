I been working all night, man
What's a young kid got to do to blow up?
This life's becoming something I can't stand
Tell those people "Go Home" I don't want to grow up
I drank too much again last night, damn
Woke up with a hangover, time to roll up
Been workin' so hard can't they understand?
So many kids like me, we just wanna blow up, blow up, blow up
Blow up, blow up, blow up
Yeah, we just wanna blow up

I just wanna prove a teacher wrong
Tell them that my own degree didn't help me write a song
Only payin' attention to the girl with the thong
And the skirt so short, it's like she barely has one on
And uh, sick of hearin' bout my alcohol abuses
And makin' up extravagant excuses, they're useless
So deuces to the classroom, welcome to your dreams
That made you without a major, homie, welcome to the team

Blow up, blow up, blow up
Yeah, we just wanna blow up

Waking up, weights become a trend
I roll over in the morning, random girl up in my bed
And I swear she was a cutie, she was lookin' like a ten
But the proof is in the puddin I was obviously bent
Obviously put it on a rich girl's tab
Just tryin'a make money like a rich girl dad
So deuces to the school life, welcome to the game
That made you without a major, homie, look what I became
