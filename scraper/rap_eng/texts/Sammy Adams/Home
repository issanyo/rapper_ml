[Chorus]
Home, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah

[1st Verse]
It’s probably something that you used to, you got me
So stuck on you cause you that cool, baby
Born in the USA, I have to say it
I wear my pride like a tattooed lady

The way these stars and stripes
Light up the sky tonight
Can’t seem to find a place
Like where we at tonight

Like where we at tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
So much to see, so much to say, I mean this
Land of the free and the home of the brave
You call this nation your own, this nation your place
I call it good old times in the USA

We call it

[Chorus]
Home, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah
Feels so good to be home, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah

[2nd Verse]
You'll say "Life’s a party," if you don’t know, I'll say it
You’ve come prepared? Well, I hope so, baby
I’ve got a place we could all roll later
We'll sneak off on the low, low, faded

The way these stars and stripes
Light up the place at night
Can’t seem to find a place
Like where we at tonight

Like where we at tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
So many nights and so many days, remember
Just being home and kissing my face?
You hate the times you were gone, could never erase
These good times that we had in the US of A

We call it

[Chorus]
Home, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah
Feels so good to be home, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah

[3rd Verse]
So welcome back the troops that were gone
To every person flicking lighters went out, come home
And if I’m lucky catch the red eye and make it home
And we can do it all again in this place we call

We call

[Chorus]
Home, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah
Feels so good to be home, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah
