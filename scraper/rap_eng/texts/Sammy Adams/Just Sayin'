Champs league

Chicks at my table lookin at me all perplexed
Like if you ain't interested in me at least give me sex
Whats next
Take over electro, get dough
Longer than a giraffes neck go lets go
Wanna party with animals baby lets live
Rollin up while my manager checks in
Your girl came through my spot with a terrence
Told me she was dolo so they heated when they rolled in
Secretary askin time on the weekday
For you and homies to come check them on reply
Iyaz runnin that solo no relay
Juice all up in my rhymes
Who are these lames

Wake up tip on to the next one
Am i running this game no question
Sammy MP3 on the kick drum
Drill us up don't matter where we come from
Who are they playin, who are they playin, who are they playin
I'm just sayin, I'm just sayin, I'm just sayin

Third wind haven't slept don't plan on it
Rather smoke a couple grams go spit flawless
Yup, the studio lookin like my home
I'm gettin views like apps on the iphone

I might head down south MP3 get Loco

Wake up tip on to the next one
Am i running this game no question
Sammy MP3 on the kick drum
Drill us up don't matter where we come from
Who are they playin, who are they playin, who are they playin
I'm just sayin, I'm just sayin, I'm just sayin

Who are they playin, who are they playin, who are they playin
I'm just sayin, I'm just sayin, I'm just sayin
Who are they playin, who are they playin, who are they playin
I'm just sayin, I'm just sayin, I'm just sayin

Wake up tip on to the next one
