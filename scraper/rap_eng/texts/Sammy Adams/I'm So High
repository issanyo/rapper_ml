[Hook]
And I'm ok baby, I'm just fine
And I must step back, and close my eyes
I can't see the ground cause I'm so high
I'm so I'm so I'm so high

[Verse 1]
That's just the way it goes
Rock bottom watching my inspiration fold
Thrown in the game, no warm-up but I ain't cold
Transition from ice cold to luke warm
Wanna feel my story homie come and put my shoes on
Yeah, Cause since the beginning people be hatin'
When I see 'em I'm just grinnin'
(What up hatas)
Grew up in the city blowin' Ls while we winnin'
You know I'm going just had as hard in the ninth inning
As the first thanks Boston for Raisin' me
Thoughts clear with a splash of complacency
Sammy Adams the prey of the agencies
Unless it's Ari Gold
Homie get the fuck away from me
Waitin' on the game so patiently
Living life styles that you would think were make believe
Never stole a swag, bit a line, none of this
I only did me thinking how I could become the shit

[Hook]
And I'm ok baby, I'm just fine
And I must step back, and close my eyes
I can't see the ground cause I'm so high
I'm so I'm so I'm so high

[Verse 2]
So high, dodging jets straight, straight yay flow (zoom)
No pipe dreams, getting pesos
But I'd rather get love, get besos
Tracks on repeat, girls asking who makes those
Give a damn if your boys don't like me
I'm on track now like Nike, almighty
If you get money just tend to it politely
If you got bars, beating me is unlikely
Always had a chance
You never had a glance
I'm the cool kid in the meetings
When others would piss they pants
Head up in the clouds, sophisticated stance
While my body's in the office, supplyin' their demands
And every hour in the booth that I'm getting paid for
Wonder why it's dark outside, and where today go
Cuz' it's easy to get your name known
When everything you're recording is straight fuego

[Hook]
And I'm ok baby, I'm just fine
And I must step back, and close my eyes
I can't see the ground cause I'm so high
I'm so I'm so I'm so High
