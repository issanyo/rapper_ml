[Verse 1]
First off, I'm a pimp
And you know that
Steady serving fools, young Novak
Minding my biz, oh yeah
So many pictures I should have a shared Kodak, know that
Care less about your girl with another guy
Even more about your dude with another fool
Tryna throw it all down
Get laid, get paid, yeah I'd do it all again, see you next time
Tend to yours, I'll tend to mine
I don't care about yours or you're sharing mine
If your girl with a man, and you're with another girl, then I'd say it's your world, it's none of my business

[Chorus]
Play it off girl
I know your name
Don't need anything to rock with you
Take it off
Go and misbehave
Don't need anything to rock with you
Don't need anything to rock with you, and you

[Verse 2]
Straight posting at the bar with a tall boy
Come and get up in my face, start the wrong boy
Talking 'bout last night when I wasn't in the city
I was out in L.A. with two broads sitting pretty, yeah
Speaking of that, I'm dodging all the nonsense
Buy your claims, your girl is gonna start shit
It's on the time to play the mediator
Can't drop to the max, I'm a gladiator, gladiator
So before you make assumptions, jump in
Do your research, I was busy with my consumption
Girl got her fingers up in my face like what is this?
I said, "that's just none of my business."

[Chorus]
Play it off girl
I know your name
Don't need anything to rock with you
(I wanna rock with you)
Take it off
Go and misbehave
Don't need anything to rock with you
Don't need anything to rock with you, and you

[Bridge]
Yeah, see how this all plays out? (plays out)
In the city with a love face down (oh yeah)
I ain't looking for a ring like that
Just a fling with a pretty little thing like that, ha
Cut the lies and the gossiping
You know you ain't gotta be a drama queen
Just know that when I'm finished, that shit that shit's none of my business

[Chorus]
Play it off girl
I know your name
Don't need anything to rock with you
Take it off
Go and misbehave
Don't need anything to rock with you
Don't need anything to rock with you, and you
Don't need anything to rock with you
Don't need anything to rock with you, and you
Don't need anything to rock with you
