[Intro]
Main town Main town what up, Yeah
Sammy Adams, Cam Meekins what up

[Verse 1: Cam Meekins]
It's the kid, rockin' the lamp city 101
Trouble come, go ask my moms I'm her number one
Do or die, we all gonna die
What you gonna' do with your life
Gettin' high tryin' to live in the moment tonight
I'm a real dude, set real trends and I'm floating
Start being you, most of these people is just coping
When I come out, styles like an ounce and I flipped it
These pretty girls, loving my swag so exquisite
I'm leaving I'm leaving I'm on my way
I cannot hear any of all that bullshit you say
You said I was crazy, when you're the one that was lost
But I still love you, so come and hit me with your sauce

[Hook: Cam Meekins]
I'm wide awake, and I can't figure it out
I don't know if I really love you or I'm eyeing your style
But I can feel you feel you like you're always around, so Imma' steal you steal you when I'm in your town

[Verse 2: Sammy Adams]
Yeah! We got a table didn't pay for it
Not a care in the world, no no
Nothing wrong stacking pesos
Guess you're running everything if you say so
Endo in London and I'm low off of these benzos'
Act like you been there but you lack those credentials
Put ten on it, matter fact put a benz' on it I've been on it I still vomit
Had it back to the wall 2010, honest I'm so gone I'm so gone my god I'm lit, you know I been on I been on get off of my dick

[Hook: Cam Meekins]
I'm wide awake, and I can't figure it out
I don't know if I really love you or I'm eyeing your style
But I can feel you feel you like you're always around, so Imma' steal you steal you when I'm in your town
I'm wide awake.... I'm wide awake.... I'm wide awake, wake, wake, wake, wake, wake wake wake wake wake
I'm wide awake, and I can't figure it out
I don't know if I really love you or I'm eyeing your style
But I can feel you feel you like you're always around, so Imma' steal you steal you when I'm in your town

[Outro: Cam Meekins]
