Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feeling lit feeling like 2 AM, summer night

Hands on the wheel ho, I'm on, fuck that
Hands on the wheel ho, I'm on, fuck that
Hands on the wheel ho, I'm on, fuck that
Hands on the wheel hoooo

[Verse 1]
Yeah, confident as a motherfucker but never gassed
I'm still two credits from my degree, I don't need to pass
Rather score points and just put up for my seat
Meet in the bench, don't see eye to eye
About my motherfucking drink
So put up or take a seat
Take that number, take a beat
You a slumber I'm wide awake like Katty Perry blowing me
But nah, we just blowing trees
See, there's a bed flying overseas
BBSG, that's that motto
Ok cool ya, that's a T, yea that's a T

[Hook]
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feeling lit feeling like 2 AM, summer night

Hands on the wheel ho, I'm on, fuck that
Hands on the wheel ho, I'm on, fuck that
Hands on the wheel ho, I'm on, fuck that
Hands on the wheel hooo


[Verse 2]
Ice in my wallet like J Brands
Sigin tits soon as the plane lands
Can't forget about my hommies in the bean
Yeah they living out they dreams like Inception
So your bitch is a 10 but she's just a 9 and hit her
Hit me up cause I'm verified, Twitter
Told her that we're rolling deep and friends with her
Told her I'm the same dude, just a lil bigger
One's company and two's a crowd
Three's a party so we shut shit down
Looking for the club house, can't be found
Yes, we've got a fattie over couple pounds
Go Warhal, getting in the gauge like war huh
She square it up but we tear it up
Got my word, I ain't never gonna fall off

[Hook]
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit feelin' like 2 AM summer night

Hands on the wheel ho, I'm on, fuck that
Hands on the wheel ho, I'm on, fuck that
Hands on the wheel ho, I'm on, fuck that
Hands on the wheel hoooo
