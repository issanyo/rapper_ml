[Chorus]
Shorty want it all
Tryna make it happen
Just so happens she attractive
How far you gonna fall?
Before you're on the mattress
Are you really 'bout the action?
'Cause I'm really 'bout your accent

[Verse 1]
Never wanna act like I know it all
But I know when a woman is worth showing off
If I'm being superficial then show me the door
But if I'm super official, are you looking for more?
Never beat around the bush or waste time like
Life's short, you should spend it in the lime light
With a lil touch here and a bust there
Saying ? nothing's really unfair
I guess I'll ride that out
Now you're a star, just need to find your route
And I'ma find out how
All I have is my love and my word
Hoping you ain't cool in your ?

[Chorus]
Shorty want it all
Tryna make it happen
Just so happens she attractive
How far you gonna fall?
Before you're on the mattress
Are you really 'bout the action?
'Cause I'm really 'bout your accent

Shorty want it all
Tryna make it happen
Just so happens she attractive
How far you gonna fall?
Before you're on the mattress
Are you really 'bout the action?
'Cause I'm really 'bout your accent

[Verse 2]
I can see you from the stairs, standing right here
You steal the show without trying, that shit is quite rare
Forget the opinions and shit you might hear
Know my position ain't tripping at all despite theirs
In due time it'll happen
Just make sure you got your seatbelt fastened, oh yeah
It's clear what other people intend to
What I got these other people only pretend to, yeah
'Cause we gon' put 'em all to bed soon
And say a little prayer to God it sent to, oh yeah
You about that action
Me and you got a date with my mattress right now

[Chorus]
Shorty want it all
Tryna make it happen
Just so happens she attractive
How far you gonna fall?
Before you're on the mattress
Are you really 'bout the action?
'Cause I'm really 'bout your accent

Shorty want it all
Tryna make it happen
Just so happens she attractive
How far you gonna fall?
Before you're on the mattress
Are you really 'bout the action?
'Cause I'm really 'bout your accent
