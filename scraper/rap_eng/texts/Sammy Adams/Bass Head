Motha fucka
Barcelona on Bitch, Oh
Lights out

Word on the street is
Money he got plenty
He ain't playin
They ain't ready
Shits gon get a little heavy, oh
Beatin up the beat
Early up I call it Breaky
And I'm skatin through the generous
Ridin fast like a (bang bang)
365 day cash flow diet
If I ain't doin shows or in the studio I'm dyin'
Buzz that I created make people think I was buyin
I guess these dudes forgot that makin money takes some grindin'
I been doin this for 9 months but I'm sure they know
That I put in more work that you have in like 4, 5 years or so
Can't hear all them haters
Learned a technique couple weeks ago
Middle fingers up bitch
My eyes are closed

Yeah forget
Mr.Stern
Alex (energy)
Oh (Basshead)

Stop time ocho
Taller than you front row
Yellow flag not throw
I'm whack thought so
Hard to take a loss oh
Eyes on picassos
I'm a mile high smokin nuggets in a bronco
Hear me on my junk go all records all gold
Record labels all hoes
Talkin to my mom oh
So rude but in interviews a gentlemen
Can't compare me to somethin in the game that's (oh oh)
Uh like me like me
And these bitches mad I care more about my nikes
Stuck off a plane blowin smokes like lee
And these dudes are blown away goin on beats like these (whoo)
Yeah, I call it hip hop dubstep
This has not been done yet
Shit that get the club wet
Yeah I'm movin out I got a sub let
Mad I gave the game somethin that they haven't fucked with
Yeah and admit it feels awkward
To not say a word but know that everyone's talkin
Every eye is watchin
Studio locked in
Go and get this off me
Baby failin's not an option
Yeah ironic how I walked in
And if it was the 90's
I'd be blastin in your walk-man
Please, hold the comments I get often
You need to take a breather
Maybe you should take a walk man
