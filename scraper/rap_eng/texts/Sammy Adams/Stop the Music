[Intro]
I’m not gonna let go of you girl
Till you say stop
You say stop
You say stop
You say stop
And I’m just gonna keep on dancing
Just let me stop the music
Stop the music
Stop the music
Stop the music
Stop

[Verse 1: Sammy Adams]
Any other day I would shake this off
But I’m in over my head
So I keep swimming to the light til I’m alright
And I’m just tryna get to the dance floor
Cuz I know if I can make it I can drown all of my problems for the night
So I’mma keep moving
And trickin while you watch me
Actin like you don’t want it
But can’t take your eyes off me

[Hook]
And I’mma be here til the storm stops
The club closed so I suggest we take this to my place
Or yours after this part if that’s alright

I’m not gonna let go of you girl
Till you say stop
You say stop
You say stop
You say stop
And I’m just gonna keep on dancing
Just let me stop the music
Stop the music
Stop the music
Stop the music
Stop

[Verse 2: Sammy Adams]
Any other girl I would break this off
But there’s something I can’t let go
And she has it, that’s why I keep holding on
I’m just tryna get out and there’s more
‘Cause I know if I can get there
I can see her and forget what’s going on
So I’mma keep drinking
And acting like I don’t see
You over standing by the DJ
But really watching so closely

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Imagine the stairs an elevator air
When I celebrate this double 0 7 out of here
So I slowly disappear to the hotel lobby
With the cutie concierge, pass another group of hotties oh
Any other day I shake this off
Think nothing but I back up all my things, take off
Cuz all the other things in the world get lost
When you dealing with a feeling, hear the kick drum round yea

[Outro x2]
I’m not gonna let go of you girl
Til you say stop
You say stop
You say stop
You say stop
And I’m just gonna keep on dancing
Just let me stop the music
Stop the music
Stop the music
Stop the music
Stop
