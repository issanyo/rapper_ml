[Verse 1]
Yeah, I know this girl could be the death of me
But I take a chance girl preferably
Rather play the game if you F with me
Then let’s flex
Blowing hard like a referee
We in Oregon, God bless the tree
Add a little more love to the recipe
And I’ll show you

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna love you at the red light
Girl, you should be my go to
Come get caught up in my headlights
'Cause when I’m with you I can’t slow down
Strike me with your lightning
When everybody else cancels out
We still shinning with the high beams, the high beams

[Chorus]
So kiss me while we driving
Kiss me while we driving
Kiss me while we driving
So kiss me while we driving, long as we driving

[Verse 2]
Yeah, swear this one is a better me
I’ve made mistakes, but I’m better, see?
Now I’m riding high that’s what better means
So let’s flex
On the road or in bed with me
Yeah, Volunteer like I’m in Tennessee
No rolling deep it’s just you and me
And I’ll show you

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna love you at the red light
Girl, you should be my go to
Come get caught up in my headlights
'Cause when I’m with you I can’t slow down
Strike me with your lightning
When everybody else cancels out
We still shinning with the high beams, the high beams

[Chorus]
So kiss me while we driving
Kiss me while we driving
Kiss me while we driving
So kiss me while we driving, long as we driving

[Verse 3]
Yeah, she’s mine so don’t mention me
No pills pressed but she ecstasy
And next to you, well, rest in peace
Yeah, sun setting to the left of me
Life ends and we riding
Nightfall and we firing, we firing

[Chorus]
So kiss me while we driving
Kiss me while we driving
Kiss me while we driving
So kiss me while we driving, long as we driving

[Chorus]
So kiss me while we driving
Kiss me while we driving
Kiss me while we driving
So kiss me while we driving, long as we driving
