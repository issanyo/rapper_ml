I love summertime cause I love all the parties
Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of Bacardi
Can't go to work I'd rather lay up with a hottie
Single doesn't mean I'm looking for somebody

[Verse 1]
I just need a dime and some sunshine
A little magic a cut above the average
Everybody moving I told 'em this will happen
Cut above the records who the hell you think they blastin'
Kiss the hand of the new boss all jazzed up I ain't ever been to Utah
Packed up ready for the journey got my U-Haul
Game's over sunk the 8 followed by the cue ball, cue ball, cue ball

Tapes pop Panama to Cuba
Jack's chasing everything I chew on
Life is just a party and you missing every nuance
Keep your comments cut 'em out the picture with your coupons, coupons
You are everything I'm looking for
Fireworks every time that I'm looking towards
Everything I do I, do I, I promise Ima do it to the best of my ability
I prove it

[Hook]
I love summertime cause I love all the parties
Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of Bacardi
Can't go to work I'd rather lay up with a hottie
Single doesn't mean I'm looking for somebody

We gon' live, live it up, feel like this, feel like love
And we on top so come with us
If you gon' roll then lift your cup
Summertime

[Verse 2]
I just need a pretty girl one time
No commitments down to get it in quick
I'm just tryna drink a few
Soak up all the sunshine
Not a damn thing running through my young mind
Thank God for the new hits
Walking down the beach and hearing my own music
Couldn't feel better
Cutie on my right bad as ever
And my homie told me I could never get her, get her, get her, get her
Yup I can't even explain the feeling doing nothing
But just chilling with your gang
Things up on the road and I seen a board of planes
Can't compare to being with the homies
Some things just never change
It's summer love some numbers gon' exchange
I left a couple hearts bleedin'
It's part of the game
And I know I, know I, gotta lot of work to do
But Ima keep on working for the music

I love summertime cause I love all the parties
Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of Bacardi
Can't go to work I'd rather lay up with a hottie
Single doesn't mean I'm lookin' for somebody

We gon' live, live it up, feel like this, feel like love
And we on top so come with us
If you gon' roll then lift your cup
Summertime, whoa, whoa, whoa
To Summertime, whoa, whoa, whoa

We gon' live, live it up, feel like this, feel like love
And we on top so come with us
If you gon' roll then lift your cup
Summertime, whoa, whoa, whoa
To summertime, whoa, whoa, whoa
To summertime, whoa, whoa, whoa
