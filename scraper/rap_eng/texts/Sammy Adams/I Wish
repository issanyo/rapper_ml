[Verse 1]
My best friends call me Wiz, my cougars call me kid
And even though these haters talking, I ain't hearing shit
The girls call me all the time, women call me fine
And my birthday fell in August, so my auntie call me lion
Maejor call me young, pops call me son
Music is my lung, so the best is yet to come
Benny call me Sammy, LA call me Grammys
Mikey call me Wizzy F, and Boston call me family
Critics call me inspiration, my lawyer call me patient
Agent call me superstar, accountant call me cakin'
And Nicky call me tio, cousins call me Leo
Always entertaining every single person we know

[Hook]
Cause I wish, I wish, I wish I was
I wish, I wish, I wish I was
I wish, I wish, I wish I was
I wish, I wish, I wish I was
Cause I wish, I wish, I wish I was
I wish, I wish, I wish I was
I wish, I wish, I wish I was
I wish, I wish, I wish I was

[Verse 2]
Sizz said I was one of the greatest, we ain't even make it
H call me animal and fans call me famous
My liver call me faded, and foes call me the fakest
And I don't ever answer cause I'm out here getting it
Team call me boss, when we out on the road
You've got to live and experience everything you know
Youth call me leader, overachiever
All day dreamer, please stay, I need you
Ex call me liar, best friends call me fire
Can't help but admire, though, I'm next in line
Al call me Bubba, my mother call me stubborn
Keith call me brother, and girls call me lover

[Hook]
Cause I wish, I wish, I wish I was
I wish, I wish, I wish I was
I wish, I wish, I wish I was
I wish, I wish, I wish I was
Cause I wish, I wish, I wish I was
I wish, I wish, I wish I was
I wish, I wish, I wish I was
I wish, I wish, I wish I was
