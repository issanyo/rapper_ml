[Verse 1: Sammy Adams]
In Vegas, yeah I drink JÃ¤ger
Throw bangers, get serenaded by ladies basically naked
It's crazy this life I take it
Everybody notice, white girls drink Vodka Sodas
Jack and cokes will get you open, tequila shots are the dopest
And I love it, the way you look so fine when I'm faded on my 10 gin and tonic
But keep on getting persuaded that I wanna crack a Jameson
Invite all your lady friends, tell that bartender serve a mothafuckin' round again

[Hook: Sammy Adams]
Tell that bartender make that motherfucker stronger
I wanna go all night longer
A couple rounds going down like water
I wanna go all night longer
Cause I do this every night
I wanna do this every night
A couple rounds going down like water
I wanna go all night longer!

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Hoppin' up out of that Lotus lookin' focused
Everywhere we get noticed cause they know us
Tell the promoters send more gin and soda
If you know me you know I'm never sober
You know this body aroma I'm a stoner
Crumblin' marijuana on your sofa
Watchin the bentley [inchomprehensible]
I wanna, uh, get to know ya bring you closer
Threw a concert on the highway
Woke up in somebody's driveway
Take a hit to get rid of the migrane
We do it again like it's Friday
Turn this motherfucker sideways
Turn this motherfucker sideways
Came to Vegas for the weekend, but
The after-party last for five days
Bands

[Hook: Sammy Adams]
Tell that bartender make that motherfucker stronger
I wanna go all night longer
A couple rounds going down like water
I wanna go all night longer
Cause I do this every night
I wanna do this every night
A couple rounds going down like water
I wanna go all night longer!](3349724)

[Verse 3: Sammy Adams]
Stars and stripes, I'm a veteran
Proud to be an American
Got bud in my system, my medicine
So I'm up for whatever [inchomprehensible]
Who was just [inchomprehensible] that [inchomprehensible]
Weren't we just chuggin' them bud lights
Swear to God I put it on life
We party, we party, you known that
Annehizer, no Busch league
Casue I'm big league and these rookies
And we could drink you under tables for days
But I'm thinking [inchomprehensible] like a [inchomprehensible]
And show everyone, everywhere, our shit
Cause when sammy roll ever so often
They start stippin ain't really an option
(Let's go!)
