[Verse 1]
Only one
Only one
Only one
You were so out of my league like I was lost for words
I couldn't even begin to speak right
Not to mention each night couldn't seem to spark that conversation
I kept stalling out just waiting at the green light
Push the clutch and finally broke the damn ice
Would of done it sooner had I knew you were intrigued by me
Had no idea kept making these excuses now your mine
I'm gon' prove it, I'm gon' prove it

[Hook]
Just had to say you're the only one
Can't deny you this song any longer
Girl you have done the impossible
Can't even like your the only only only one
Girl your the only one
Girl your the only one
Girl your the only only only one

[Verse 2]
Girl you were so beyond that fly shit
I can't even tell you or explain how wide my eyes did
When you walk in the room its hard to keep a friendly conversation
Cause everyone's stuck on my chick, my chick
Everyone look at my chick
She got the touch and moves to make me loose it while we grinding
She makes the room light up but that's the last thing on her mind
Told me this would happen I just thought that he was lying

[Hook]
Just had to say you're the only one
Can't deny you this song any longer
Girl you have done the impossible
Can't even like your the only only only one
Girl your the only one
Girl your the only one
Girl your the only only only one

[Verse 3]
Only one, only one, only one
Crazy never thought this would happen but your love knocked me out
So before write a flatten any questions write them out
Now we stuck deeper and I swear its true
I can't go out I can't look around
Cause none of these girls compare to you

[Hook]
Just had to say you're the only one
Can't deny you this song any longer
Girl you have done the impossible
Can't even like your the only only only one
Girl your the only one
Girl your the only one
Girl your the only only only one
