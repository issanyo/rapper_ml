[Hook]
Like water falling slow in the ocean
Like a life with no love here

[Verse 1]
Five AM up in the air and it's starting to snow
These tears slipping through my shades and it's starting to show
Can't even sleep. I'm wide awake, couple hours to go
I guess I'm stuck rewinding what happened to us but I don't know
Got an e-mail from my mother but I didn't read it
The subject was 'city of love' so I had to delete it
I went to surf, played the game each time I was defeated
You got a heartbeat? Send it over I think I'mma need it
Cause mine was ripped out, didn't even flip out
Chartered the jet home and got a text saying 'missed out'
But really I'm the only one who didn't miss out
A situation that handed man a heartbreak, picked out
Say I'm living a dream? It's more like a nightmare
Still put on a smile for the camera but man it's quite clear
Something that I had is a week ago, yeah was right there
Pouring out all my feelings in hopes that one of y'all might care

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My face pressed against the window pane
Fogging up the glass in the window so I could trace your name
Watching cars on the ground switching outta lanes
Staring over the city feeling different cause something changed
Damn. Took off without a F or two
And even though I left, felt there was something that I could do
Could've done, too late now
Every single girl I take home just seems fake now
But it's my fault: instead of closing the curtains
I let the show go on in search of the missing person
And as I question if finding you's even worth it
Remember kissing, touching, girl we were almost perfect
And the clouds rolling in again
Raining on the city when it clears
They still in my head, thunderstorms
Thunderstorm
Yeah
