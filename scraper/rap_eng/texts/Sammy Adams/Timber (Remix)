[Intro: Ke$ha and Sammy]
Wooooo, woooo, wooooooo
Wooooo, woooo, wooooooo
It’s going down
It’s going down

[Verse 1: Sammy]
We knocking down trees in this bitch – man – timber
Bitches trying to match like I’m an app – ha – Tinder
Not Justin Timberlake, I’m more like Justin Timber-Drake
And Timbaland’s on Instagram, speeding across the interstate (zoom)
Flannel like a lumberjack, cut ‘em like a running back
LeSean McCoy with all my boys, the birds are always down to clap (clap)
My clique is so huge posted up with no dudes
You stuck outside the club we turning up man no rules
Racks on racks on fuckin’ racks
Drink a fifth don’t shop at Saks
Steal your bitch and fuckin’ laugh
I’m chiefing in the fuckin’ sack
I’ve got that good wood
Ain’t talkin’ ‘bout a necklace man
Laying down that good on your wifey yea I’m reckless man
I’m moving West with the fans in the Bay now
You fell off of the ugly tree, hit every branch on the way down
So fuck you and your whole team
We winning fool we own this
I’m fascinating, captivating you jacks are boring

[Hook: Ke$ha and Sammy]
It’s going down, I’m yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let’s make a night, you won’t remember
I’ll be the one, you won’t forget

[Verse 2: Sammy]
Dippin’ like a big boy
Horseshoe of some Skoal straight
Copenhagen Scandinavian girlies are so great
My mine’s from Mississippi – M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I
Give her my Mason-Dixon and she flippin’ Sammy dollar signs
Wizzy F baby don’t forget boy I was made to ball
Down in West Virginia fuckin’ bitches that’s the maiden call
Moonshine and some hollows
Rollin’ in Colorado
My life is like a Twitter page you bitches need to follow
My flow’s cold I’m good though
Pack loud on that indo
Asking if it’s the fire it’s the best shit in the woods bro (yea)
And that’s the business, music’s the tradition
Vroom Vroom the chainsaw is coming for all you bitches
No lying, young lion, rebel I’m so defiant
Got no Achilles’ heel, you’re hurt, you’re Kobe Bryant
So, stop trying to pitch me on your swag ‘cause I ain’t buying
I’m a boss Paul Bunion in this bitch I’m a giant

[Hook: Ke$ha and Sammy]

[Outro: Sammy]
Boston’s Boy I never left either
Let’s go – out
