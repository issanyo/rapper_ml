[Intro]
Yeah Sammy Adams
Matty Trump muthafucka
Oh yeah I said that again
Boston’s Boy you ain’t fuckin’ with that

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you how I do it
Run an extra mile music
Fuck it make it four
Make these females die to it (I make ‘em die)
Sippy on the cough (cough)
I got floozies takin’ shots (shots)
And real soon they be so boozy take some nudies and we off
I got it runnin’ level 15 on the treadmill
Sweatin’, over-thinkin’ like who she gotta impress still
Stand-still, chin-up, look down a little
On the cusp of something ill
But still feel stuck in the middle (stuck in the middle)
Come pour my cup up re-re-wind it bottle suck up
That whole drink that you just poured is not important come get fucked up
I got

(You want that you want that)
You ain’t- You ain’t makin’ Pop Money

[Verse 2]
Cash in. Cassius Clay I’m dishin’ mad hits
Let’s just count our money
Bet I won’t finish the fastest
Fuck her on a school night
I don’t need to finish classes
I’m lookin’ down on million that’s how I become so classless
Breakfast is servin’ I’m waving to Tarantino (wassup)
In the hills free on my chains when my chain is still Valentino (hangin’)
I’m so Gucci so appealin’ like a roofie got no feelings
‘Cuz the game made me an animal so I ain’t got no ceilings
Competition sounds terrific that’s hysterical
Whereas you got the biggest buzz in the world
But can’t sell a fuckin’ ticket
I got

Pop Money Pop Money
(What you want you want that)
Pop Money Pop Money
(Oh you forgot I got that)

Pop Money Pop Money
You ain’t- You ain’t makin’ Pop Money

[Verse 3]
Rich girls try and lock me in their mansions
Got ‘em open got ‘em open know I’m all about expansion
White girl in the hills of Beverly
Bad bitch out in NYC
Both their dads are richer than me and my crew will ever be (oh man)
This here’s just my POV
Needed planes no B.o.B
I’m just trynna hit it if I can’t hear fuck you like Cee Lo Green
Closer than Brazilians
I proved to be resilient
A million ain’t cool. What’s cool then? Billions
(C’mon guy, I wipe my fucking ass with a million dollars)
Blow the confetti went from photo shoots with Heidi
So she’d get the West to kill for her East coast ain’t even ready (East side)
I got
