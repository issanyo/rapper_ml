[Intro: Yonas]
Roll one up
Hold me down
Roll one up
Roll one up
Hold me down
(Yeah)
It's ya boy YONAS
Let's go

[Verse 1: Yonas]
She a fly senorita, no she no diva
Woke up in adidas, fresh wife beater
Skin tan from Ibiza, no goalie but a keeper
She spend her own money when she swipe up her visa
Ohhh man
Never be lonely
Because I'm a blank movie, put your scene on me
And you ain't gotta stress, you can lean on me
We can roll one up tonight

[Hook]
I know that you gotta be the one
Because life without you is no fun
And just about every time you come around I'm in love
I never felt quite this way
It might be crazy of me to say
But enough though it ain't
I'm feeling like it's my birthday
So let's celebrate
Hey, I want you to know
I ain't got a care in the world baby
Roll one up and hold me down
Roll one up and hold me down
Cause I want you to know
I ain't got a care in the world baby
Roll one up and hold me down
Roll one up and hold me down

[Verse 2: Sammy Adams]
I just want you rollin up with some bikinis
I swear it’s simple but it’s better if it’s teeny
Used to get the dial tone
Now I’m hitting milestones
Rollin fuckin blunts the size of NFL pile ons
Still a drop out, key to success...
…being real while you’re locked down, baby I’m blessed
I remember, dreaming of private planes and all nighters
Beast, ripping up your chest like a type writer
Post up, yup, just like Shaq should
Rock another beer
Tell her roll another backwood
We so good, got beef everyday
KK no Kanye but got ‘em goin' cray
So roll another one, roll up what you wanna son
'Cause you know I’m not the one
But homie lemme tell you some’n
Now you see it in your mentions, and notice
The muhfuckers going places, Sammy and Yonas

[Hook]
I know that you gotta be the one
Because life without you is no fun
And just about every time you come around I'm in love
I never felt quite this way
It might be crazy of me to say
But enough though it ain't
I'm feeling like it's my birthday
So let's celebrate
Hey, I want you to know
I ain't got a care in the world baby
Roll one up and hold me down
Roll one up and hold me down
Cause I want you to know
I ain't got a care in the world baby
Roll one up and hold me down
Roll one up and hold me down

[Verse 3: Roscoe Dash]
She so down to go up
On any given Sunday I drown at least once
She bound to be lunch when we on the liquor
Lick her like I get richer, the sicker and I deliver
I'm in love right now
Gotta give thanks to the man above right now
You the only one that I'm thinking of right now
Like you ring, you the reason for the buzz right now
Hell yeah, you my inspiration
Come impatient like a patient, her masturbation
Either way, no mistaken
Rollin weed like Jamaicans
Do all the shit we was thinkin
We brand new as a spankin'
It's her rap city the basement yessur
I could write so many pages, a book
So many things that I can't overlook
Like how them jeans might be the real victim
I'm electrified like they got eel in them
Now we got issues, who gone deal with them?

[Hook]
I know that you gotta be the one
Because life without you is no fun
It's about every time you come around I'm in love
I never felt quite this way
It might be crazy of me to say
But enough though it ain't
I'm feeling like it's my birthday
So let's celebrate
Hey, I want you to know
I ain't got a care in the world baby
Roll one up and hold me down
Roll one up and hold me down
Cause I want you to know
I ain't got a care in the world baby
Roll one up and hold me down
Roll one up and hold me down

[Outro]
Roll up
Hold me down
If you call, I might not be in town
But ohhhh I'll be on another flight
Across the country, no way
I can pick up a call from any other girl like any other day
But I know that you gotta be the one
Because life without you is no fun
And just about every time you come around I'm in love
I never felt quite this way
It might be crazy of me to say
But enough though it ain't
I'm feeling like it's my birthday
So let's celebrate
Hey, I want you to know
I ain't got a care in the world baby
Roll one up and hold me down
Roll one up and hold me down
Cause I want you to know
I ain't got a care in the world baby
Roll one up and hold me down
Roll one up and hold me down
