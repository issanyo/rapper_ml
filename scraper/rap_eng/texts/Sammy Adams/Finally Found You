[Verse 1: Enrique Iglesias]
You know I'm going to get you, yeah
Whatever it takes to, get there
No I won't drop you
Like everybody else does

[Hook: Enrique Iglesias]
Forget about your friends, they don't care where we go
If they do, we'll get lost in a crowd of people
I've been looking for you
Forever baby we go
Together baby we go, we go

In this crazy world of choices, I've only got a few
Either you're coming with me or I'm coming with you
Cause I finally found, I finally found you
You never have to worry if what I say is true
Girl I've been looking for you
And when I saw you I knew
That I finally found, I finally found you

[Verse 2: Enrique Iglesias]
I'm coming I'll get ya, yeah
We have a connection, that's right
Because girl I'm not letting go
I'm gonna make you feel right, oh yeah

[Hook: Enrique Iglesias]
Forget about your friends, they don't care where we go
If they do, we'll get lost in a crowd of people
I've been looking for you
Forever baby we go
Together baby we go, we go

In this crazy world of choices, I've only got a few
Either you're coming with me or I'm coming with you
Cause I finally found, I finally found you
You never have to worry if what I say is true
Girl I've been looking for you
And when I saw you I knew
That I finally found, I finally found you

I finally found, I finally found you

[Verse 3: Sammy Adams]
Yeah, so can I get love
Too much to ask for really so tough
Find yourself moving with the sex of the drums
Got my hands full, grabbing all these girls, girls
Hands up, hands up
Dance floor chilling when I hold two cups
Can't stop spilling because I'm drunk as fuck
And my song comes on and the club goes nuts
Every province I go, city I sleep, its best that yaâ€™ll know
Running around, and doing all these shows
Round the whole globe, I come, and you go girl
And you need to think of it
Just wrap for the night, baby live a bit
With a place to hit, and your pants to zip
You can make a scene and party, are you into it...

[Outro: Enrique Iglesias]
In this crazy world of choices, I've only got a few
Either you're coming with me or I'm coming with you
Cause I finally found, I finally found you
Finally, finally, finally found you
Finally, finally, finally found
Finally found, I finally found you

You know I'm go get ya, yeah
