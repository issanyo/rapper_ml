[Intro Hook]
It's hurting my eyes, it's hurting my ears
I know, I know, I know there'll be tears
You're hurting inside, been hurting for years
I know, I know, I know there'll be tears
Life's never that clear

On another midnight
On another midnight
Run

[Verse 1]
It's a long way down without a chute ain't it?
Well I ain't leaving any time soon baby
So call the media, press and paparazzi
Got some things on my chest, I got up off me, yeah
Cause its easy to lose your mind, when you never in the same place, never had the time
The girl you love at home, slowly starting to despise
Excuses you keep throwing, that I knowing that they lies

Shake your head, won't look you in the eyes
Hoping that your lawyers tries to catch one of the lines
And catch one of the lies
And try to put and end to your career
But really turn in being blessing in disguise

Six comma zero zero zero comma zero zero zero
You the man
Kinda

They call that work, but works not whats its called
Don't forget how much you wanted it before you had it all
Yeah

[Hook]
On another midnight run, sniffin for trouble, unlucky for some
On another midnight run, I'll still be breathing come the morning sun
It's hurting my eyes, it's hurting my ears
I know, I know, I know there'll be tears
You're hurting inside, been hurting for years
I know, I know, I know there'll be tears
Life's never that clear

[Verse 2]
It's a long way down without a chute ain't it?
Well I ain't leaving any time soon baby
So tell your favorite blogger or magazine, to get on it while its hot
These stories still got the steam

It seems

Music is the reason I'm alive
And karma while it sucks, seems to always pick a side
The lows come to level with a monumental high
Was lost on navigation, now I happened to be fine

Oh

I get it, stay loyal to your M
I said fuck money, stay loyal to my friends
Because when it runs out, you'll be looking for a pen
But they're ain't no one to write, was it worth it in the end?

Nah

And when you think about it, it depends, huh?
I know the answer, ain't got to pretend "huh?"

They call it work, but works not whats its called
Don't forget how much you wanted it before you had it all
Yeah

[Hook Outro]
On another midnight run, sniffin for trouble, unlucky for some
On another midnight run, I'll still be breathing come the morning sun
It's hurting my eyes, it's hurting my ears
I know, I know, I know there'll be tears
You're hurting inside, been hurting for years
I know, I know, I know there'll be tears
Life's never that clear

On another midnight
On another midnight
Run
