Swing your drank, but if you ballin' swing that bottle

Yeah
[Hook]
Swing a drank if you balling swing a bottle
We up in the club get your girl back tomorrow
Cause we get it poppin' only hitting models
If you ain't a ten get your hands off my bottle

I'm up in the club chillin' with a couple twelves
Bottles of the Goose rollin' up a couple L's
Heaven bound? I don't know, I might go to Hell
Cause you know I'm a sinner. Baby girl you couldn't tell?
Now I'm a get my mind, get my mind, get my mind right
Hard to not be the man, catch me in the limelight
Catch me at my table standing on the joint
Two chords and my mic and my mac are connected like cable
Shorty swing your drank to the side then drop it
I can fill you up my supply's not stopping
Cause we hit the club and it's just like shopping
Any bottle that you like, girl go cop it

[Hook x 2]
Swing a drank if you balling swing a bottle
We up in the club get your girl back tomorrow
Cause we get it poppin' only hitting models
If you ain't a ten get your hands off my bottle

Yeah
V.I.P. and your girl's trying to roll
She's about 26, chick you a little old
Not to mention that you only care about my dough
Or the fact that I can spit it any stage, any show
We livin' in a world that they say is so cold
But life's good baby cause my champagne gold
My girls stay hot when the wintertime goes
And they all know who they are they ain't nothing if they don't
[?] shoes with a black dress matching
3 bottles poured up call that a hat trick
Yeah
Just wanna see you jump till your knees can't bend
My entourage deep so you need your friends
Hop up in the Beem with the two [?]
Plus four on the rims
That's what we be in
Like what you see? Baby please come taste it
Not a Jersey boy but I am the situation

[Hook x 2]

[Bridge]
Swing your drank, swing your bottle (Swang, Swang)
[X4]

[Hook x 2]

Maybe your drinks do
(Hahaha)
That's why we got bottle service baby
All night
Oh yeah
