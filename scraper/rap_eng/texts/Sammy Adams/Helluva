[Chorus: Kat Nestel]
Let me show you what I like
Let's have a helluva night, yeah
A helluva night
I've got a friend that's just your type
Let's have a helluva night, yeah
A helluva night
It takes three to make it all count
You and me and her should get down
So let me show you what I like
Let's have a helluva night, yeah
A helluva night

[Verse 1: Sammy Adams]
One is company, two's a crowd, three's a party if it all goes down
Yup, bring a friend, you could both get plowed
Both-both find out how I look down south
I'm what they don't make no more
Your friend's the one I saw on Facebook, though
Gotta make sure her cake looks swole, as I'm pulling up her page, how her face look?
Ohhhh she a savage
Look bad as fuck and she practice
So whatever you down with your mouth, yeah, as she bounces,  it's fantastic
Role play, wanna touch on ya
We can both pay like a customer
She and her fuck in the cuffs and thongs
One, two, three, ménage à trois

[Chorus: Kat Nestel]
Let me show you what I like
Let's have a helluva night, yeah
A helluva night
I've got a friend that's just your type
Let's have a helluva night, yeah
A helluva night
It takes three to make it all count
You and me and her should get down
So let me show you what I like
Let's have a helluva night, yeah
A helluva night

[Verse 2: Sammy Adams]
Don't know how I got on top of ya
I ain't really into being popular
She told me, "I can really see the star in ya. I can see it from afar like binoculars."
I said, "Don't know if you've heard of this. If you'd even come close to deserving this."
But your friend's my type
I know you like everything that I'm saying so let's go tonight
Gotta x those plans
Under 21?
Gotta x those hands
Master chief, but I've got master plans, in the master bedroom, I'm a master man
Master man, move fast 'round here
And he can't match?
Well I just don't care
So raise your glass, tap an ass, got a pass 'round here
2 girls, 1 guy: that's a fact right there

[Bridge: Sammy Adams] X2
This could be perfect, let's run around
Meet up with one of your friends, I would be down
Worth it, if you're in town
Got a voicemail said, "don't back out, don't don't don't back out."

[Chorus: Kat Nestel]
Let me show you what I like
Let's have a helluva night, yeah
A helluva night
I've got a friend that's just your type
Let's have a helluva night, yeah
A helluva night
It takes three to make it all count
You and me and her should get down
So let me show you what I like
Let's have a helluva night, yeah
A helluva night

[Outro: Sammy Adams]
Let me show you what I like
Let's have a helluva night, yeah
One helluva night
You've got a friend that's just my type
Let's have a helluva night, yeah
One helluva night
