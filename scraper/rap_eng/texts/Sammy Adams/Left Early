[Chorus]
Okay, God brought me here on a Sunday
I went straight to work on a Monday
I took a half day on Tuesday
So I stayed late on Wednesday
I went the whole day on Thursday
Did the same thing on Friday
But fuck that I did it my way and left early
Yeah this right here the weekend
And when the week ends
I take a time out, take a sec and begin
And I know that everybody just got they own theme song
But this one the one that I'ma lean on
This weekend, this weekend like yeah

[Verse 1]
I feel too good to stay home
A couple new numbers in my phone
And e'rytime I drink I feel like I'm Ne-Yo
'Cause I hate every love song on the radio
Okay, this shit for my off day
Give a fuck about what my boss say
Got a couple homies with me always
The same ones from the hallways
The same me you see at night time is the same me you see in broad day
Yeah, I grew up right there on broadway
Come find me, hold up
And I might, I might let my shoulder lean like I'm Young Dro (Young Dro)
I came to make friends not to seem so dumb
Hit me with that busy shit you gettin' too close
Rule numero uno
Now I'ma throw a party in the front yard
Streets full of parked cars
Neighbors gotta deal with it
Can't nobody stop ours
If they call the squad cars
Move it to the back yard
That's what the fuck I'm callin' a remix, let's do it

[Chorus]
Okay, God brought me here on a Sunday
I went straight to work on a Monday
I took a half day on Tuesday
So I stayed late on Wednesday
I went the whole day on Thursday
Did the same thing on Friday
But fuck that I did it my way and left early
Yeah this right here the weekend
And when the week ends
I take a time out, take a sec and begin
And I know that everybody just got they own theme song
But this one the one that I'ma lean on
This weekend, this weekend like yeah

[Verse 2: Sammy Adams]
I woke up Sunday so you know I had to go flex (flex)
Never thought 'bout 20 on a Rolex
I ain't ever sleep or catch a case of the Mondays
Wishin' you and me, just keep on prayin' baby one day
Tuesday got it lit
Wednesday I was here
Thursday I was shootin' right 'til Friday 'cause we never miss
Writin' while I sip
Hit up Quill
Warn him 'bout the clowns
Just like colley birds [?]
Finally these herbs come around, yeah
We're really too busy to give a fuck
You will never see me givin' up
Saturday I ain't got weekends
Sunday I'm workin' 'n beastin'
Momma still tells me I need to rest
Father so proud when he sees the checks
See me on sights and they never guess [? 2:43]
Come for you Quill like I'm playin' chess
Oh yeah, haters it was nice to know ya
Takin' off got things in store, yeah
But leave if you ain't heard me over time over sign [? 2:57], yes and never leave

[Chorus]
Okay, God brought me here on a Sunday
I went straight to work on a Monday
I took a half day on Tuesday
So I stayed late on Wednesday
I went the whole day on Thursday
Did the same thing on Friday
But fuck that I did it my way and left early
Yeah this right here the weekend
And when the week ends
I take a time out, take a second beat and [?]
And I know that everybody just got they own theme song
But this one the one that I'ma lean on
This weekend, this weekend like yeah

[Outro]
And I ain't goin' into work unless they pay me what I'm worth, yeah (hold up, yeah)
Nah I ain't goin' into work unless they pay me what I'm worth, yeah yeah (hold up)
Nah I ain't goin' into
Nah I ain't goin' into
Nah I ain't goin' into
Nah I ain't goin' into
Nah I ain't goin' into work unless they pay a mother fucker, yeah yeah
