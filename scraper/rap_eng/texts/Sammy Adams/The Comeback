[Hook]
Hey Daddy, Daddy
Got some hope that I could wish for
Bag Full of dollars
Some need a fist full
Hey Daddy, Daddy
I can't wait for you to get home
Bag full of goodies
What more could I wish for?
Hey... Hey...

[1st Verse: Sammy Adams]
Took off on the red line
Train to the city
Backpack, black jeans, dirty tee
Lookin' pretty
Starvin' to cop some sneakers
Gets off when it stops at Harvard
But Concepts ran out of Jordans
The same pair that he wanted
Dips, heads on to Boston
Crosses over the river
Lookin' over the Charles
Reflections off of the building
Sox roll into Fenway
Up 5 on the Yankees
Jumps off of the bar
And he's off right out of State Street
Next day, there's some bombers
Them cowards, they try to level
Some people there for a marathon
Ordered straight from the devil
Then a certain magazine
Rolling Stone, So aware of it
Decided to give a cover to a motherfuckin' terrorist
Older class, be ashamed, don't need him now
Especially seeing them kick him when he's on the ground
On the way to being better than it ever was
Comeback season, know its only love
Homecoming (Echo)

[Instrumental]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sammy Adams]
He moved away to play ball
Scholarship to take off
Athletics kept him busy
Was killin' it, 'til the late fall
Four goals in four games
Two gamewinners
Was All-American bound to All-American finished
Trainer took a couple looks and motioned game over
Pain couldn't touch how hurt he be
From all these hangovers
Get it out
Started producing
Mind straight from him losing
The only thing that he knew since age 2
Chucked up the deuces
Wrote a song about his college with no fuckin' idea
That the words that he was writing
Would catapult his career
Then he took off
Decided fuck the books and be his own boss
Traded taking classes and practice
To learn his show cause
Road less traveled
Not rattled by all the ruckus
Shortly moved to the city
And toured the country on buses
Stayed loyal to the fans
But he didn't see the storm coming
Wanted to blow up
But didn't know it'd explode on him
Homecoming

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sammy Adams]
He signed a deal, so surreal
In the thick of it
But damn he missed home
Once the world was at his fingertips
Solidified a team for the dream
Homie lost a few
To just a fuckin' year ago
We thought would be impossible
Best friends stay close
Never gave him shit
Cause he was busy doing work
When they were busy gettin' lit
He said, Fuck all the glits
Wasn't planing to get rich
Till the fans spoke
After Wizzy [?] became the shit
Lifestyle switching, learning from mistakes
Hurting from missing out on the surface
But wouldn't break
In his flight from the west coast
Touch down at Logan
Didn't check a thing
But all the baggage he was holding
Goddamn
Back to the city
That made him home with the garden
Jumped back in his truck
That his brother had when he started
Fresh air from the summer
Slowly fading to fall
East coast boy made it after all
This is Homecoming
