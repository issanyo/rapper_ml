Yeah, RIP Kimb

That's alright
That's okay
We take a couple poppers and we get to the gate
We're stuck over heaven every single day
The days we chilled talked shit, got Laid
And hey, ucks when it happens to those who can take it
But your life, Kimb should be celebration
So we gon' embrace it
Till' we see your face kid
Till' then can't wait to see you again
Can't wait to see you again
Can't wait to see you ah

Without love we perish
Like losing another brother we cherish
Not to mention all such parents
Make you wonder what got these fairings hung
We could walk through fairness
Seeing Kimber O.C. marriage
Sipping on some young so careless
Wonder right now what he's wearing
Chillin' up in the stars
Still can't believe he's gone
Kimber you still live on
Through the lyrics of this song
Just know that we love you kid
No, man, no I just stopped the tip
We hating the game up rocket ship
And this is why I spark a bliss

That's alright
That's okay
We take a couple poppers and we get to the gate
We're stuck over heaven every single day
The days we chilled talked shit, got Laid
And hey, ucks when it happens to those who can take it
But your life, Kimb should be celebration
So we gon' embrace it
Till' we see your face kid
Till' then can't wait to see you again
Can't wait to see you again
Can't wait to see you ah
(Instrumental Break)

My Dude, my Bro, my Dog
Never thought I would see you gone
And you know I pray to God you with us when these times are hard
And if I had these calls
Tonight your life be here with ours
But you never had to make a song
Loved your Case, your Dad, your mom
And I look up in the sky
When I get lonely
Or I get high
Put on Kimber
Blast this shit
Till' my fucking tears coincide
And you know I die inside when I hear this shit on rock
Just let it rock, yeah
Just let it rock, yeah

That's alright
That's okay
We take a couple poppers and we get to the gate
We're stuck over heaven every single day
The days we chilled talked shit, got Laid
And hey sucks when it happens to those who can take it
But your life Kimb should be celebration
So we gon embrace it
Till' we see your face kid
Till' then can't wait to see you again
Can't wait to see you again
Can't wait to see you ah
