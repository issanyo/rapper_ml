[Intro: Indy]
Yeah, yeah
One, two, three, let's go
Yeah

[Chorus]
Shit hypes when it gets through to me
All this talk 'bout whatever you should see
And no amount of talking can fix what you started ho
That's why you ain't gettin' no love
At all, no way
No, you ain't gettin' no love (yeah, yeah)
At all, no way (no way)

[Verse 1: Indy]
Yeah, okay, you ain't getting no love (no love)
Okay, so watch the homies glow up (glow up)
Yeah, a couple thousand just to show up
You talkin' like a kid, you should grow up
And man, all of my homies started back when we was young
And now we selling tickets, never thought the day would come
This money growing quicker than the flower in the sun
The goal to make a billion, I ain't quittin' 'til it's done
I'm livin' shit I used to see when I was down sleepin'
I'm inches from the riches, I guess you could say I'm creepin'
I'm 'bout to catch a flight, a different city every weekend
I got some bitches tweekin' when they see us in the BM
It's like it all the time, it's like that all the time
I'm dreamin' 'bout all the shit I'm tryna give to mom
And I ain't gonna show up, that's the payment is involved
And if it is, you ain't gettin' no love from the squad, hold up

[Chorus]
Shit hypes when it gets through to me
All this talk 'bout whatever you should see
And no amount of talking can fix what you started ho
That's why you ain't gettin' no love
At all, no way
No, you ain't gettin' no love
At all, no way (no way)

[Verse 2: Sammy Adams]
My sky miles in a milli' count
I bring the words to the sky, watch us spill 'em out
To all the 18-year-olds still feeling out
Dream so tall, I promise you gon' figure it out
Life journey, let us slide places
We sly faces and skyscrapers and never know when God take you
But he do
Wavy like high tide and Seadoo's
And Ri-Ri on the carpet wearing see-through, no redo's
Uh uh, I never hesitate
I David Blaine on all your beats so watch 'em levitate
They say you barely mediocre if they never hate
I guess it's safe to say I'm running shop, I'm catchin' hella shade
Pay 'em zero mind dollars or any time
I just sip 'em couple fifths when it's Henny time
No love for the motherfucking nonsense
Me and Indy lickin', had to bring it, shit hard, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Shit hypes when it gets through to me
All this talk 'bout whatever you should see
And no amount of talking can fix what you started ho
That's why you ain't gettin' no love
(Don't got A phone, I ain't pickin' up that)
At all, no way
(Girl don't even try to take me all the way)
No, you ain't gettin' no love
At all, no way (no way)

[Bridge: Sammy Adams]
Don't call the phone, I ain't pickin' up that
Please don't even try to take me all the way back
I been through the bullshit, I took this the long way
You think that I'm cool, slide through, that's the wrong way
Usually, we ain't got no love
Where were you when I was showed love
Now you first in line 'cause we glow love
Glad you get to see it in every kid who wrong

[Chorus]
Shit hypes when it gets through to me
All this talk 'bout whatever you should see
And no amount of talking can fix what you started ho
That's why you ain't gettin' no love
At all, no way
No, you ain't gettin' no love
At all, no way (no way)

[Outro]
That's why you ain't gettin' no love
At all, no way
No, you ain't gettin' no love
At all, no way
