[Verse 1]
The way you look is a problem
The way you look is a problem
Yeah, the way you look I've been chasin'
Cause every time I hear your voice
I feel my heart be start racing, honest
I'm yours for the takin'
Focus mine is just spacin'
Never find a replacement
Let's just fly on vacations
I want you girl, no mistaken
Beauty never gets jealous
Cause she knows Sammy's a fella
None of these girls can measure
Up to what I got to tell ya
Write this wifey's song
Always loved you all along
Wake up in the morning she's a tale that have no makeup on

[Hook]
The way you look is a problem
The way you're lookin' at me
The way you look is a problem
You do it to me
The way you look is a problem
The way you're lookin' at me
The way you look is a problem
You, yeah, you, yeah, you do it to me
The way you do it to me

[Verse 2]
The way you look is a problem
Cause every guy that sees you anywhere is sweating full throttle
And you look better than models
Forget hotels and the bottles
We ball till there's no tomorrow
Listenin' to you, come follow
Fill up in me with sallow
Girl he didn't try college, still got some bills in the wallets
I'm yours, you're mine, we acknowledge
Clear the rest for you, honest
Wearin' sweats and tee's
Never seen nobody look so mean
Smart, sexy, calm, reflective
Glad I got her for my team

[Hook]
The way you look is a problem
The way you're looking at me
The way you look is a problem
You do it to me
The way you look is a problem
The way you're looking at me
The way you look is a problem
You you you do it to me
The way you look is a problem
(Problem, problem, problem, problem...)
[Hook]
