[Hook]
I hate college but love all the parties
Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of Bacardi
Can't go to class, I'd rather lay up with a hottie
Single doesnt mean im looking for somebody
Some say they drink blaze up, but hardly
Poppin' PK's, ski a little bit of molly
Am I out my mind most people say probably
But I've been on my grind puffin' nugs of that cali, collie

[Verse 1]
Pack my bag no parents didn't drop me off
I felt lost saw some herbs all wearing Lacoste
Couple dudes in pinnies musta played lacrosse
Grabbed my duffle and I hustled through the dormitory doors
Of course my homie lived on the same floor
Soon to blow trees and down to pound Coors
Down to pound whores, out of time though
Flow the better up to the whole town oooh
I hate college but love getting laid
Socialite swagger at night when the sun fades
Check my sun shades talking about upgrades
I can't see the haters no more I feel great
My eyes 20/20 so sunny when skies gray
I'm loved by the honies what more can I say
I'm just getting paid working like a slave
Between school athletics and music its all day
So invite your friends to come play
Gave you the invite if you miss it don't complain
If you lucky get a kiss but miss no that's lame
Wanna get it in with wizzy, I'm your man
Sweating bullets no fan can contain
Short to pull it, but quick to amaze
I'm looking forward to tours in these planes
Seeing the cork popping from bottles of champagne
Dear lord taking your name in vain
All these sins in college that I made
Well well my game's off the chain
I last a couple hours tomorrow go insane

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep cause my god damn teach keeps assigning essays
Due at the end of each week
But little do they know I got a show by the beach
Watching girls flash Wizzy way more than their teeth
They mad I'd rather learn flows than their lesson plans
But sit me down asking do you get the message Sam?
This is your life and you're in school to get right
Nah, music is my sun and you blocking my light
And if I don't blow get high and ignite
My life full of lines so my money gets nice
Well money's not happiness, you'll only get greedier
But shit it'd make life a whole lot easier
And my field gets a whole lot cheesier
Dominos bread but still getting meatier
But schools good for one thing I must add
And that's having a plethora of my vocab
Whole bags of verbs that I must grab
And throw down like a rich girls bar tab
