And you know we on top now-ow
Livin’ that li-ife, doin’ it ri-ight
Feel so undefeated-feated-feated
Feel so undefeated-feated-feated

And I’m clearly up on the top now
And we ain’t goin’ any time soon no oh
I feel so undefeated-feated-feated
Feel undefeated-feated-feated

I wish I was a saint, I wish I was a prince
But I thought about my sins, I ain’t thought about it since
They thought that I fell off, just be rackin’ off these wins
Now they callin’ me so fool, there’s no room to armor it
And the music’s getting good, getting louder every summer
Tell those ones that now we need more booze, motherfucker
Better move, motherfucker
When you lose, you a sucker, only then
OKC is what I’m reppin’ to the end
And they try to put me under but I barely stay afloat
When that Judas made the team and a lil bit of ho
That’s no joke
Yea, help nope, I got none
Too late, please just stop son
I saw dreams, and copped one
And I live, this is awesome
Hopin’ to make a killin’, get at me, get at me
With my gang and all my fans and we rappin, we rappin’
Well actually, you really gotta see it to believe it
Same reason that we still undefeated, you a shit

And you know we on top now-ow
Livin’ that li-ife, doin’ it ri-ight
Feel so undefeated-feated-feated
Feel so undefeated-feated-feated

And I’m clearly up on the top now
And we ain’t goin’ any time soon no oh
I feel so undefeated-feated-feated
Feel undefeated-feated-feated

So I stopped making hits yup and I started writing history
And since I’ve got the taste of it, been hungry for some victories
All the hype and fame, they try to play you, they do shit to me
So I came out of scade and blazing
And the music’s getting good, getting hotter every summer
Don’t leave your girl around us cuz somebody’d probly fuck ‘er
I stayed in rodenems and some calm guard chuckers, straight wins
OKC is what I’m reppin’ like the Thunder
Ok, ok, ok
Same crap that Josh dropped to make these people wonder why the hell he sell that shows from fall into the summer
Yo pretty motherfucker, the story you couldn’t cover
The homie you didn’t discover, that homie’s on every cover
I got the youth and my title is the leader
The man about playin’ QB and I’m just a wide receiver
I told ‘em once I had the legs to believe it
Main reason that we still undefeated, you a shit

And you know we on top now-ow
Livin’ that li-ife, doin’ it ri-ight
Feel so undefeated-feated-feated
Feel so undefeated-feated-feated

And I’m clearly up on the top now
And we ain’t goin’ any time soon no oh
I feel so undefeated-feated-feated
Feel undefeated-feated-feated..

I feel so undefeated-feated-feated
So undefeated-feated-feated
So undefeated-feated-feated..

And you know we on top now-ow
Livin’ that li-ife, doin’ it ri-ight
Feel so undefeated-feated-feated
Feel so undefeated-feated-feated

And I’m clearly up on the top now
And we ain’t goin’ any time soon no oh
I feel so undefeated-feated-feated
Feel undefeated-feated-feated
