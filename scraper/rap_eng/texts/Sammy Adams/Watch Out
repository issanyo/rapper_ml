[Intro]
Watch out my time is now (chopped and screwed)

[Verse 1]
Two monsters walking in the Oscars
Smelling like body odor, whiskey and lobster
Rosewood got 'em feeling like a monster
But strip down to nothing but a pair of my boxers
And I walk this carpet like I own, like I own this shit
And I know you fucking notice it
No way to control the kid
So, so quit while you already, you already down
Throw my bottle and my gallons half way full on stage and fucking bounce
Cause I ain't doing this for you or you, or her, or him
I'm just here to stack my wins
And make enough dough
So when the time comes I could buy this town!

[Hook]
I'm on my way – can't stop me now!
I'm taking over every spot in town
I'm screaming “Watch out!” (Watch out!)
Watch out (Watch out!) my time is now

[Verse 2]
Yep, Hollywood, oh, I'm just so Hollywood
Cause I sold my records as an indie artist
Than your signed ass ever could
But fuck the industry, I am this fucking industry
And the new kids run the game now
Better change those locks gotta get new keys
Upset that I'm winning in two places racing like Charlie Sheen
Spazzing out on live TV
Woke up in the H, took out the IV
Ran through the doors and screamed down free
But to my surprise I still could see that
I still got... still got snakes trying to feed on me

[Hook]
I'm on my way – can't stop me now!
I'm taking over every spot in town
I'm screaming “Watch out!” (Watch out!)
Watch out! (Watch out!)
Watch out, my time is now!

[Verse 3]
Just had a thought of genius (yup!)
With a stroke of luck
Think I'll never make it as an artist (well)
Think I give a fuck?!
I repeat, I rock Ducati
You know I'm gon' be looking up
Put the city on my back 'til I can't walk no more
Yeah, that's what's up!
In front of all the doubters
I'mma rub it right in their face
But the fanbase out this world
With no label in place
And just in case you forget about me
Check out the Billboard charts every 4-5 weeks
Guess whose name you fucking see?!
