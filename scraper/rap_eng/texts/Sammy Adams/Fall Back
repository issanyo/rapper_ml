Poppin pills like I'm sick boy
We're number one don't forget boy
I'm a machine and running the team
From the fuckin bean I just stay coy
Island life the vacation flow
Reppin USA everywhere I go
Got it on my arm so you already know
That I'm comin for your spot I'm bringing JCO
Woop! New Sammy track
Never run away but it's cool fall back
Always been cool so the fame just adds to the fact that we got the whole room so packed
We good we don't need no cause
The team likes being in the city so we don't see no stars
Whattup haters i'm back so how's my dick taste
Still good? K cool get it all back


Harder than ever my balls sharper than cheddar
Smell like tobacco and leather
Thanks Tom nobody's better than that
Spas I don't need medication
You hear it the dedication
Refuse to take a vacation (fallback)
I'm on the cover like bitches that I fuckin got
Enrique doing doubles like I'm a fucking drug I don't crack
I'm a no brainer I'm a fucking entertainer
I'm just bringin the focus like some mad mother fuckers
