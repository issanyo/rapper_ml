[Intro: ]
I don't feel the pressure no more
I been workin' hard and I know it
Pray that I'ma make it on the road
I don't even know where I'm goin'

[Verse 1: ]
Pray that one day I'ma be a fucking star
Travelling around the fucking map, let's go
Uh, I cut out people that couldn't see the vision
They get a better point of view on my own
I just know what I want, I'm not selfish
I'm makin' moves for my family, gettin' wealthy
My name booms in the city, straight goon when I'm litty
Hopefully hoppin' on a tour that's comin' soon to your city, ayy
Raging, I'm saging, I'm pouring shots
Raising some hell but we don't get caught
I'm havin' more fun than I ever thought
Finally finished up school, I'm movin' in a new spot
Spendin' twenty-four seven makin' music
I hope I go to heaven when I lose this
'Cause I just put my heart up in this new shit
But I don't even know what I'm doin'

[Pre-Chorus: ]
I don't feel the pressure no more
I been workin' hard and I know it
Pray that I'ma make it on the road
I don't even know where I'm goin'
Yeah, yeah
But I'm coastin', coastin'
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, I'm coastin'

[Chorus: ]
From the east to the west, to the north to the south, you know
I'm coastin'
From the east to the west, to the north to the south, you know
I'm coastin'
From the east to the west, to the north to the south, you know
I'm coastin'
From the east to the west, to the north to the south, you know that I'm coastin'

[Verse 2: ]
I moved out to the west so I could chase this dream
Even with the flex, you couldn't make this scene
I been runnin' audibles on plays they've seen
Money made type green and walk out
After, we gon' talk to girls you knocked out
My shit a hundred, all your shit is knockoff
Liam Neeson with the money, naw, stop
Bought 'em now, you know I have to walk off, yeah, yeah
Ain't no need to argue, tell it like it is
And way out to LA, on the flight, I'm sitting biz
You in coach fucking men, shoot at me and fucking miss
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: ]
I don't feel the pressure no more
I been workin' hard and I know it
Pray that I'ma make it on the road
I don't even know where I'm goin'
Yeah, yeah
But I'm coastin', coastin'
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, I'm coastin'

[Chorus: ]
From the east to the west, to the north to the south, you know
I'm coastin'
From the east to the west, to the north to the south, you know
I'm coastin'
From the east to the west, to the north to the south, you know
I'm coastin'
From the east to the west, to the north to the south, you know that I'm coastin'
