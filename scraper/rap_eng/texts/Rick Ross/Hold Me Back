[Mackgee - Lyrics]

I came from Africa, crazy massacre
Cheeks in the front of the whip and back of the
Navy Acura, Played ambassador
Of this rap game, no baby stamina
Grown up Swag
Fill the Ozone with blown up Grass
You ain't got money better loan up cash
Dope ass beats and the flows not bad
Better blow up SHAQ
Cause you need a baller team
Your chick short, men you need a taller queen
My sh** wicked when I hit the mall I'm mean
Big chains and my whips it's all a dream
Just like biggie track
When I come through it's like EZ Pass
Get funk flex I'm a hit VLAD
Rap insight good gift to have
Let's twist a cap
Of that cold drink
Put it on the house now the hoes wink
Hoodie Pitch black ni**** no pink
Weed every where so the clothes stink
Headphones banging from the beats by Dre
Talk green white green when I see Wale
Down south money like T.I. plate
You could get murked over freestyle craze
Every week valet
I push the whip she cook the dish
Cats on the highways - that's puss at risk
Keep your pets cause I'm running 'em over
So much tracks for you song promoters
So much roc I belong to HOVA
F**king cheap skates bubble gum or soda
If you need beef you could come to Kroger
Just like burger king I server them thangs!
These Ni**** can't hold me back
Above the law like I'm police hat
Big boi like I know three stacks
Suck my dick get on both knee caps
Turn that off, it's like totally crap
Doctor Drew you need to go to rehab
Come to my show and get a photo need pass
Twitter tweet you need to follow me back/
Pussy Hoe L.A. to Jersey Snooki show!
Make it rain as the booty goes
Making me cum it's gooey gross
Then I act cold like I'm 2 below
Don't see nothing but the jewelry glow!
Bang that west till I'm through with east coast
Bang that west till I'm through with east coast uh!
These Ni**** can't owe me half, I'm paid in full
They're angry as f**k I'm raging too
Dress code red, I'm a stay in blue
West Africa child, that's the way I grew
Married to the game I say I do
You don't wanna see stuff that the KY do
Cash rules everything play out WU
I'm heavy in the game I weigh out you!
Finger snapping let me spin it back 'n
I'm a catch a flight when I finish packing
Make more hits than a tennis racket
Landlord flow for you tenant rappers
Wrap it up good I'm a sell it after
Kris Kross over  Rick Ross, twist yours that's denim backwards
I leave hotels with a smelling mattress
These ni**** can't hold me back,  no Pun intended no Joey Crack
Get out my way when I flow give gap
Don't f**k around, does your toe need tag?
Al Pacino bring Tony back
Shallow cats they get entertained over Kim Kardashian and Chloe Clash
What the f**k men! You don't need that
