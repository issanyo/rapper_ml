[Intro]
Pluto!
DY on the track
South I'm 'bout to go crazy
808 Mafia

[Hook: Future]
Bloody Goyard that's a check
This bad Ethiopian gave me Becky (I swear to god)
You see the way I talk, that's a check
This blonde ghetto broad gave me Becky
My Crip done bought the 'ouie worth a checky
And my Venezuelan, gave me Becky
Credit card fraud, bustin' checky
Diamonds shining all on my necklace (on my neck)

[Verse 1: Future]
I got niggas dying for this (dying for this gang shit)
I just wanna shine for this (I just wanna skrr)
Ain't gone waste no time in this (I can't waste no time, time)
I done did some crimes in the streets
I told you from the jump its one thou
I could throw that up and make a pile
I just made a bad bitch pout
Hoes catch an attitude for this cash (woo!)
Tell me what she wanna do for this bag
Pussy so good, girl you ain't gotta ask
Make a nigga spend a check on that ass
Make a nigga spend a check on that ass

[Hook: Future]
Bloody Goyard that's a checky
This bad Ethiopian gave me Becky
You see the way I talk, that's a check
This blonde ghetto broad gave me Becky

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I put the Rollie on 5:30 in the morning (woah)
I really want it, I forgot I even bought it (woah)
Buy the block and I'ma die to pay the mortgage  (woah)
Dead broke, you still alive, it's rigamortis (woah)
I got the choppers so don't make me get deported (woah)
I got the scoop, they say ya clique should get extorted
I got the Bentley coupe, G-Wagon, and the Porsche
A nigga rich, the bitches brag on the Boss shit
My condolences, I heard about your losses
Killing these niggas, Ricky Ross about to floss it
I got her pussy popping on my triple beam
Black bottles or you know we sipping lean
Drinking the yellow or the red, I want the green
On leather seats, and I'm on Promethazine
Lamborghini's back to back, look like a car race
Hundred room mansion, now I think I'm Scarface (boss)

[Hook: Future]
Bloody Goyard that's a checky
This bad Ethiopian gave me Becky (I swear to god)
You see the way I talk, that's a check
This blonde ghetto broad gave me Becky
My Crip done bought the 'ouie worth a checky
And my Venezuelan yeah, gave me Becky
Credit card fraud, bustin' checky
Diamonds shining all on my neck

[Verse 3: Future]
All glass white house, sleeping with the toolie
Bad bitch by the pool, looking like a movie
5:30 A.M. putting all my rings on
I took your bitch, and gave her back to ya, I'm King Kong (Super!)
Chandeliers in the background, on the ceiling
Make sure before I die, my niggas got a million
These bitches chasing me like I'm a dream
I'm married to FreeBandz, that's forever
I got Floyd pulling up at the house on a yacht
I'm a millionaire and I'm havin' way with these thots
Pull a chopper, put a few Dracos in them spots
You was coolin' off, and I was warming up, now I'm hot
I got bitches like new shoes, they don't come out
I got shooters gonna make the news if they pop out
Too many diamonds on, they got me snowboarding
Tell ya fuck the kid, but ain't got nun' to show for it

[Hook: Future]
Bloody Goyard that's a checky
This bad Ethiopian gave me Becky (I swear to god)
You see the way I talk, that's a check
This blonde ghetto broad gave me Becky
My Crip done bought the 'ouie worth a checky
And my Venezuelan yeah, gave me Becky
Credit card fraud, busting checky
Diamonds shining all on my necklace (on my neck)
