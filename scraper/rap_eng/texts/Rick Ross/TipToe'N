[Chorus]
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
Hope you don't speak to me, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
Hope you don't speak to me, hope you don't speak to me

[Verse 1]
Flowers for the bitches, bottles for my dawgs
I got coupes in the yard, so I fuck 'em all
I got Ballys on my feet, the money on my mind
All year we run around like it's the summertime
Ship my Bentley to Jamaica, "what the bumbaclot?"
My bitch dreads to the floor, that pussy Rastafari
Top shotta told me, "shut it for a batty boy"
Kidnapping charges, walk up in the with John Gotti's lawyer
I'm tiptoe'n out the court, hope you don't speak to me
Just respect a nigga name or die peacefully
I don't fuck with sucka' niggas, that's the other side
And they still do B&E, that's on my brotha side

[Chorus]
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
Hope you don't speak to me, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
Hope you don't speak to me, hope you don't speak to me

[Verse 2]
The bitches for the playas, guns for the goonies
I'm addicted to this way, I'm accustomed to movies
Cigars in the mornin', lobsters and the omelette
Your vibe not the vibe if money not the topic
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hop in the 650
Got another young nigga gettin' rich with me
I'm flossing just to floss, I hustle to the core
I said the biggest boss, I always wanted more
Real estate, you gotta' see a nigga gates
[?] in the pen, cell phones on his waist
You know the streets will come with hell of benefits
I went and got the stick, they said it's hit or miss
I'm still fuckin' bitches out the magazine
Better log-on young niggas havin' things
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, nigga
I bumped into Carmelo in the Wraith, nigga

[Chorus]
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
Hope you don't speak to me, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
Hope you don't speak to me, hope you don't speak to me

[Verse 3]
Touch a couple dollars, time to pay your taxes
Keep another seven figures in a pissy mattress
Forbes list, five years, niggas started clappin'
Feds indicted half the city so I started rappin'
Her baby-daddy went to prison, shorty started strippin'
Then I got a pint of sirrup and we started sippin'
I pull up in a Wraith, them bitches saw the difference
Stop dissin' pussy niggas, ain't no competition
When you pull up to the crib you see the waterfalls
You would think that I produced TLC Waterfalls
Them boys was sellin' crack while they was smokin' speed
This only type of profit come from overseas

[Chorus]
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
Hope you don't speak to me, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
I'm tiptoe'n out the bank, hope you don't speak to me
Hope you don't speak to me, hope you don't speak to me
