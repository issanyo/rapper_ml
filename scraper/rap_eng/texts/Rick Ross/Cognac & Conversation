[Intro: Teedra Moses (Rick Ross)]
All around the world
(Yeah, love how you move)
All around the world
(I wanna take you to Art Basel
Some shit like that)
All around the world
Boys stare, girls twirl

[Verse 1:]
Damn you’re trigger happy (Bang, bang!)
So happy to see me
Got your foot down on the gas
Won’t you slow it down a little baby?
Let the music play
To the be-beat of your arms baby
As my body starts to sway
I’mma slow it down a little for you

[Chorus:]
Cognac and conversation
Sky miles, we flying high
We’re international
We’re galaxies beyond
Cognac and conversation
Just you and I

(All around the world
Boys stare, girls twirl)

[Verse 2: Teedra (Rick Ross)]
I’ve been gone away too long
Glad you’re here tonight
Wanna take my time and show you
What’s been on my mind
We gon’ make these collard greens (Yeah)
Sip yak from finest vines (I wanna take you to Art Basel, some shit like that)
Cloud surfing on a level (Some chill shit)
Most can’t reach in life
Sky high (Or we can go to a comedy show baby)
Most can’t reach in life (You wanna go to a comedy show?)
Just you and I

[Verse 3: Rick Ross:]
These niggas funny like Dave Chappelle
Grind so hard, praying I prevail
Young fly nigga, let me say my piece
As I puff a cigar with the Argo leaf
It’s only called love when there’s passion in it
Gimme that brain, girl academic
Glass of Belaire with the apples in it
Star Island, name another rapper did it
Find me a plug from Cape Verde
All I wanna talk is straight work
New Belle Harbor like a big boy
You can tell by looking at the invoice
Close to forty bands, I tell you man
Put you on the team, better yet the band
Sam Sneak still on the ones and twos
I’m the one [?] how the funds will move

[Chorus:]
(All around the world)
Cognac and conversation
Sky miles, we flying high
We’re international
We’re galaxies beyond
Cognac and conversation
Sky miles, we flying high
We’re international
Just you and I
All around the world
(yeah, love how you move)
All around the world
Boys stare, girls twirl

[Outro:]
And it feels so good, it feels so good [x3]
And it feels so good
(Girls twirl)
