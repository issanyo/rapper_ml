[Intro]
Uh
Hey give me a black bottle
I can't dance good but I'mma dance tonight, you hear me?
Baby just don't step on my feet, nigga toes hurting

[Pre-hook — Mack Wilds]
Vacheron on my wrist, yeah you know it
Used to dream about that crib, now I own it, baby
Big boss big shit, know I'm on it
Smile on my haters, know I had to hit 'em with that

[Hook — Mack Wilds]
Money dance, money dance
Money dance, money dance
Money dance, money dance
Smile on my haters, know I had to hit 'em with that

[Verse 1 — Rick Ross]
Funny to see a ghetto nigga so classy
Enchanted by women who speak nasty
Tip toeing to court, went there for the past week
Leaning on my lawyer pinky looking glassy
Charges dropped, these plaintiffs just wanna tax me
Secret service wanna see me driving taxis
Hug my attorney and then we do the money dance
Whitey Bulge' or a soldier leaving Vietnam
Pledge allegiance to the flag
Where we keep it 100 or get your money back
Pull a plug, brain dead, dope game nigga
Knew the rolls was fake and so we brought the real with us
Repertoire hustle such a tenacity
High roller, bet us another masterpiece
More Rakim then maybe Master P
Thirsty nigga paid in full I'm tryna buy the beach

[Pre-hook]
[Hook]

[Bridge]
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

[Verse 2 — Sonny Cheeba]
Dorothy Dandridge dance dolls is dangerous
Circle around the Sandman, purposefully keep my hands on him
Panaromic view when they birthday suits
Tap dancin' all, money dancin' all. slam dancin' on the Trans Amber
Threw too many shots at the block party
Pardon me, blazes Parliament, skunks Funkadelic
Pardon me, don't get my gloves dirty, get the golden arms
Armor's off the the emperor, armor called an R&R

[Verse 3  — Geechie Suede]
L-l-l-l-let's burn the branch and do the money dance
C-c-c-countin' clappin' genie breakin' rubber bands
P-p-p-pourin' Afrangelli double blast my hands
F-f-f-flyin' in that foreign bubble, flashin' fans

Velvet on view, v-v-Velveeta she mellow with moves
Money dancin' diva sativa cherry cha-chillin' cruise
Black bottle, latin lava, laughin' like she won the lotto
Night of El Dorado then wobble her cake across the marble

[Pre-hook]
[Hook x2]
