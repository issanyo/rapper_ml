[Verse 1:]
Yellow Wallabies in the Summer time remember me?
38 special wife beater ain't no killing me
Runnin with my dogs fucking with the hoes
We be acting like stars at them other niggas shows
Luke Skywalker was my muthafuckin idol
Back in middle school I'd watch the videos and get excited
Then I started writing, but really I was biting
All that Big Daddy Kane I had the flat top like him
Fab 5 Freddy with Martin Luther King
He was quick to holler "Peace", boy did I have a dream
Now I'm staring at the TV wishing I was Whodini
Had me dancing like Hammer in the mirror with a peedi
You could see me, Ice Cube bumping as I'm rolling
We all said, "Fuck you bitch!" and kept going
To the pack jam that was our spot walking in
With a nickel bag in my hi-tops

[Hook:]
Some things change most stay the same
While I'm chilling in the hood I keep hearing niggas saying
("Don't Change")
Went and got a million, now my niggas tripping
When you push a Lamborghini you just get a certain feeling
("Don't Change")


[Verse 2:]
Back in the hood, grinding on the block
Where we all had plans of climbing to the top
Kane got shot, Black got life
I ain't really wanna write but they pushed me to the mic
So I put it on the pad, blowing in the pad
Real D Boy I had blow up in the pad
Tapes of Scarface, the world is yours
Plates and raw cake guns galore
Go and sell a few is what a nigga better do
Everything Federal when you're dealing with revenue
Hoping the casino is trying to clean some
Got 50 in the trunk
Who the fuck you mean mugging nigga?
Do my dirty work give my brother a clean hammer
If mother nature nice it will be a mean summer
Syrup on the dump, chrome on the wheels
Got work in the trunk, the zone and some heels
HO!

[Hook]
