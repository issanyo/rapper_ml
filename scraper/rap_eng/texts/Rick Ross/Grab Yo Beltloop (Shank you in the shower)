[Verse: Rick Ross]
I done seen some things, men can read
I done seen some shanks, that make man bleed
I done see some things that make grown men cry
I sat in a cell and watched your old man die
You think it's cooler, nigga's skippin' school
Smoking on a pack of cool's, getting pussy off your shoes
'till you get a charge ridin' in a stolen car
Ship you up north, another fly in the jar
Keep to yourself, put that fuzzy shit to rest
These people killers, they got muscles in they neck
Get punched in the nose, wake up in a coma
I'll make your ass a woman wearing make-up in the corner
You're feeling alone getting pressured by the gangs
Your mother visits she can really see you changed
Talking slurred ain't no telling what you're sippin'
Walkin' with a twitch, yeah this motherfucker bitchin'
UGH!
