[Hook]
The More I get, the more I want
The More I get, the more I want
The More I get, the more I want from you baby

[Verse]
If I had a buck for every mile I walk
I'd build a crib just as big as the Skyline Mall
Girls used to laugh at the way I talked
My nappy hair corduroys and my shirt seemed small
After all
Labeled a fat mack I was on my own
So from that day on I was on my own
Polished a man's shoes sitting on that throne
And made me write the song that took me all night long
Started as a poem at first but kept going
Talking rice lee snoring that boy just kept flowing
Recall walking halls and my first pair of clogs
Trapped in my mind when that fonton sparks
Time for a revolution
And it won't be televised, say goodbye to my future
My past was illusive
Like the watch glass must of stared at Medusa
