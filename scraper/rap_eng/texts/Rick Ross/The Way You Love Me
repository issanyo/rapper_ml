[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Why go hard when the so easy
Million worth of ice, I just want the chick to see me
Body like a dancer, straight from the TV
She not fighting cancer, pink Lamborghini
I'm talking the paper that you can only imagine
Most say Phantom, I'm the first one to have it
When I look out the mirror, I can see your reflection
Rozay for dinner, Waffle House for breakfast
Better put up your Breitling 'cause I'm talking big money
And all these dimes talking 'bout is big money
Pink bottles and I got ten coming
Your life goes, look boy, I been done it
Yeah she look like an angel, but she sexy as hell
Gotta make up my mind, only time will tell
Yeah, I got her Rolly, really like how she rock it
Rip her outta her clothes, take her right back shopping

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Love me, love me - it's the way you love me
Touch me, touch me - it's the way you touch me
Thug me, thug me - it's the way you thug me
The way you love me baby, you got me goin' crazy
The way you love me baby, you got me goin' crazy
The way you love me baby, you got me goin' crazy
The way you love me baby, you got me goin' crazy
You got me goin' crazy, you got me goin' crazy
Love me, love me - it's the way you love me
Touch me, touch me - it's the way you touch me
Thug me, thug me - it's the way you thug me
The way you love me baby, you got me goin' crazy
The way you love me baby, you got me goin' crazy
The way you love me baby, you got me goin' crazy
The way you love me baby, you got me goin' crazy
You got me goin' crazy, you got me goin' crazy (ow!)
