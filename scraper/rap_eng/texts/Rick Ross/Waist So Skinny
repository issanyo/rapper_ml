[Hook]
Fresh out the salon
And I just got my hair done
Niggas trynna holla at me
But I told em' move along
Cause my waist so skinny
And my wrist so chilly
You ain't puttin' up a milly
Then you won't be fucking with me
P-Put ya bands up
Gon' put a grand on it
That won't be enough
At least a hundred bands on it
Cause my waist so skinny
And my wrist so chilly
You ain't puttin' up a milly
Then you won't be fucking with me

[Verse 1: Trina]
I'm a boss bitch
I stunt first class
I got insurance this boss ass
See I don't fuck with hoes
Cause they sideways
I get this money by myself, 99 ways
I hate broke niggas, they can't tell me shit
Fuck your charger, baby mama, and that little dick
I like big bags, I like real money
The stacks stay stacked
Big bread full of hundreds, yeah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Pink bottle popper
Yellow big shopper
Pull up to the club, valet my fucking helicopter
It's not a mere
Hustler of the year
She the baddest bitch
Right here
Stacking papers like my name was Bo Diddley
Pop the caddy in the living room delay
She not a star, somebody lied
This bitch a 10, yo bitch a 5

[Verse 3: Trina]
I'm still the thickest bitch, in this rap shit
I don't fuck with yall most you hoes counterfeit
I call em glow lickers, they wanna lick my glow
I'm booked 7 nights a week, you caught the metapho'
I got a big safe of captin crunch berries
My diamonds looks like you can eat em', VVS cherries
See I'm a fly bitch, I'm making new rules
And dare a new bitch to run up on this old school, what
