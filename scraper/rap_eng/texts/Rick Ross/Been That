[Hook: Meek Mill]
I been that nigga 'fore the money and the fame
I been that nigga 'fore the diamonds and the chain
I been that nigga 'fore the foreigns and the clothes
I been that nigga on the corner with the most
I been that nigga, I been that nigga
My dog a shooter please don't make me send that nigga
I been that nigga, I been that nigga
If he keep talking I'll make him pin that nigga

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I been that nigga on the corner, nappy braids and selling hard
Now I pull up on 'em bitches, got them texting "Oh my God"
I got bitches out in Paris that be texting "Ooh la la"
I hit back like, "Who this?" She hit back, "You forgot"
Real niggas gon' link up
But my H-town pouring drink up
Just me and Junior in the brinks truck
Doing all this shit we ain't think of
Trying to wild out cause we cranked up
I'm blue-dottin that pink stuff
Maraj putting that pussy on me
Ten bands throw her mink up
I got money all in my mind ho
What do you think think I grind for?
Condoms all in my condo
Pocket change what you signed for?
My niggas my niggas
My niggas my hitters, we finna get richer
I'm talking about bigger and bigger
They stealing my swag just look at my pictures

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I been that nigga 'fore the money and the fame
I been that nigga 'fore the diamonds and the chain
I been that nigga 'fore the foreigns and the clothes
I been that nigga on the corner with the most
I been that nigga, I been that nigga
My dog a shooter please don't make me send that nigga
I been that nigga, I been that nigga
If he keep talking I'll make him pin that nigga

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Blew a half a kilo on my cuban link to watch it swing
No shirt, baking soda standing at the sink
Swerving in my Wraith, I should just pull up at the church
Have these niggas playing on me, devils wish it was a hearse
In my all black shades, motherfucking Ray Charles
I used to mop the floors now who the motherfucking boss?
I been that nigga that could get em by the two's
Snow white, no spikes, two stacks for my loubs
You a fool for your wifey and I passed her to my crew
Coke white, sour creme, butter all in my coupe
Put my dogs on salary, you see we all be blowing loud
Chopper still might judge a jury, I could take this bitch to trial

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I been that nigga 'fore the money and the fame
I been that nigga 'fore the diamonds and the chain
I been that nigga 'fore the foreigns and the clothes
I been that nigga on the corner with the most
I been that nigga, I been that nigga
My dog a shooter please don't make me send that nigga
I been that nigga, I been that nigga
If he keep talking I'll make him pin that nigga
