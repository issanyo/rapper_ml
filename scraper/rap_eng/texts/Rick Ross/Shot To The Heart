[Chorus]
I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending
And thats all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your hear

I shed tears cause im told that they'll heal
You tell the truth I don't know how to feel
Never felt alone in a room full of friends
Got big plans but you leave em in suspense
Pray for me, patience wait for me
Pay dues, trust me they ain't comin
Way back it was hoops, now its maybach coups
And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops
Now we lookin at each other, sittin in a court room
I'm laughin, cause its lookin like a cartoon
Never snitch, got it tattooed by kartoo?
(somebody switch) by my rules we all lose

[Chorus]
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control
You got it down, and your well on your way to the top
But there is something you forgot

Flippin through magazines, ridiculed for my life
But they keep takin pictures of my jewells in the light
100g's in the night, entertainin big timers
'Cause my 1 liners rude like don imus
Smellin ros on my breath, ex ? fell asleep in his bed
Habits we developed livin lavish stackin mail up
Clothes come from big n tall ?
Got live life, tryna live life
Penthouse for a pimp, only drove the benz twice
Convertible to the cars, cause I murdered all of ours
Get 50 collect calls from dawgs behind bars

[Chorus]
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying
To keep it under control
You got it down
And your well on your way to the top
(trilllllaaaaaaaaaa..ross)
But theres something you forgot

Fortune n fame are pleasures you couldn't fathem
But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace
Benjamins by the pallet, im spendin em mighty daily
I know I'm under sureveillance ( I look at it as a talent)
Millions a gotta manage, lil talents up in the rappin
Im such a threat to these n*ggaz (you never know what could happen)
I started without a coin, not knowin which way im goin
Now im chowderin ?, n readin em a few poems
Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light
I never felt this way bout anythin in my life
Determined to be the best, not lookin back at regrets
How many people you blessed is how you measure success

[Chorus]
I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart
