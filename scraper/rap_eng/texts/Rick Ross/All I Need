[Intro: Rick Ross]
It's the H-Town
Don't be scared baby
You in the mob now bitch, feel
And no way I lie baby
I'ma get you what you deserve, fuck with me

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Girl, you held me down from the start
When I used to run the block
So now there's nothin' without you
'Cause I got these broads comin' round
'Cause I got the money now
But that ain't nothin' without you
'Cause girl, you're all that all I need, yeah, need, yeah
I need, yeah, I need, yeah
'Cause girl, you're all that all I need, yeah, need, yeah
I need, yeah, I need, yeah
'Cause girl, you're all that all I need, yeah

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Picture so perfect, Vito Corleone
Bitch is so perfect, liquor turned her on
Her body like a stripper, talk like a nurse
Teeth like a dentist, digits in her purse
Wet like she drunk, far from bein' slizzard
I walk like I talk, them other niggas slither
Wrist on blizzard, my neck North Pole
Lookin' like Saint Nick, all red on you hoes
Shawty stay down, you just so blessed
You need a rich nigga, stop fuckin' with the stress
I won't feed you gritz, but I'ma keep it straight
I'm balancin' accounts, steaks on the stakes
Feet for the fleek, guards by the doors
Sleep in the minx, still fuckin' on the floors
Fuck her for an hour, fuck a lil more
I fuck her in the shower, fuck her on tour

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Girl, you held me down from the start
When I used to run the block
So now there's nothin' without you
'Cause I got these broads comin' round
'Cause I got the money now
But that ain't nothin' without you
'Cause girl, you're all that all I need, yeah, need, yeah
I need, yeah, I need, yeah
'Cause girl, you're all that all I need, yeah, need, yeah
I need, yeah, I need, yeah
'Cause girl, you're all that all I need, yeah

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Yellow whip with some chickens, movin' on chicken
Got a few tickets that we movin' on business
Few striped out, just know about the crown
Just know about my time so I did it, lifeline
She took the whole charge, gave her that bond
Came up, mobbed up, Maybach, tatted up
Bounced right back, got a bird in the kitchen
Mane this man comin', we ain't trippin' on them bitches
Back to the saddle, 150 at the crib
Doin' it how we doin' it, bitch, get it how we live
So adorable, so beautiful
So lovely, so my hoe
There's so much money in the land of the blood
It's up town where we live, up town where we thug
Move 100 thangs in the paper plate
250, count a mill every day

'Cause girl, you're all that all I need, yeah, need, yeah

'Cause girl, you're all that all I need, yeah
