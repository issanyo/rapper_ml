I like him
But I like you more
You're the type that any girl would adore
Yup, I am his
But I wanna be yours
And I would switch all up
If I had a choice
I wanna be yours
I like you more

It's my man's homeboy
And it ain't cool for me to look at you the way I do
When you walk by
You catch my eye
Feel guilty
Cause I wanna give you a try

I think about you and I touch myself
If that's so wrong
Cause my mans right here
Your swag make a good girl act real bad
Attracted to a man I just can't have

I'm with him
But I like you
I know it's dead wrong
But what I'm gonna do?
You got this girl wanting to be your boo

I try to resist
But I'm digging on you
Why you got to be friends with my man?
Why you have to slip your number in my hand?

I knew I shouldn't of called
But you're so damn fly
We got to keep this between you and I

I like him
But I like you more
You're the type that any girl would adore
Yup, I am his
But I wanna be yours
And I would switch all up
If I had a choice
I wanna be yours
I like you more

I wish you would of been with him the day that we met
Cause this would be you laying in my bed
It's sad that I'm sitting here full of regret
He's a good man
But I want you instead

Cause I see you when we doing our thang
Gotta catch myself 'bout to call your name
I think it's 'bout time for me to break this
I don't know how long I can take this

I like him
But I like you more
You're the type that any girl would adore
Yup, I am his
But I wanna be yours
And I would switch all up
If I had a choice
I wanna be yours
I like you more
