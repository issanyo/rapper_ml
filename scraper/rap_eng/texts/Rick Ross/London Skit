[Skit]
London, England, January
The weather, gray
The rain, thick
{Laughs}
I wake up, depression all around me
Dark thoughts clouding my mind
And I open the drawer and I see two things:
I see the warm Tod loafers
I see the crisp cashmere socks
And I know that today is going to be a good day
A hundred dollars a sock
{Laughs}
Two ankles, you do the math
Pull them on
Socks on the first, followed by the loafers
Then I know from that day, that week, that month, that year, that decade
That millennium
That we'll be rich forever
Rich forever!
