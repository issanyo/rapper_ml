[Bridge: Kevin Cossom]
Magic City
Where the palm trees and the bright lights look so pretty
Don't lose your soul chasin' that pot of gold

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm tryna go where I can't go
Tryna be what I can't be
I wanna teach you what I can't show
We gotta reach what we can't reach
Tryna shine when the sun won't
I gotta grind as I gun toke
She's rollin' weed as I'm doin' me
I kept the G's, she can count on me
Wonderful times, lay a head for a young nigga
Like the day she told her dad I was a drug dealer
That explains how the cars came
And all the big money at the card games
I roll dice with the low-lives
Timb boots and the coat nice
New Porsche with the smoke lights
Young nigga, get your dough right

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]
Get your money right
Children havin' children, but they don’t have a thing
All this drug dealin', it’s killin' our brother, mane
The government feed them freedom, they don’t understand
If we don’t do it now we really don’t have a chance
My sister, my brother, get your money right
Care for generations, build your mastermind
It’s time to make a livin', my brother, get your money right

Magic City
Where the palm trees and the bright lights look so pretty
Don't lose your soul chasin' that pot of gold

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I wanna go where I can't go
In Dubai smokin' dank smoke
No charges for the cellphones
But I charge 'em just to sell for
Peach Ciroc and the L's long
Get to meet Barack, rub elbows
We the ones that never got the Pell Grants
Fuck FullSail, let your mail stack
I just wanna sign another lease
Mentality of a young nigga in the streets
But I think it's time to buy that home
And if you got it give your man a loan
And if you bought it we can leave it 'lone
My niggas write it on their teeth of gold
All gold grills, but to each his own
Got in power just to put my people on

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]
Get your money right
Children havin' children, but they don’t have a thing
All this drug dealin', it’s killin' our brother, mane
The government feed them freedom, they don’t understand
If we don’t do it now we really don’t have a chance
My sister, my brother, get your money right
Care for generations, build your mastermind
It’s time to make a livin', my brother, get your money right
