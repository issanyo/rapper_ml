[Rick Ross:]
Love is a powerful word
And you've been on my mind so much, lately
How can I say this?

I'm always late to dinner days
Looking in her face
Marathon love making but she win the race
I live a certain life
It's hard for me to feel I'm safe
Toni Montana money greet the guards at the gate
Greeks and gods on the lawn, on the estate
Versace couches, sandals, candles, and matching plates
This picture's better than Bocciat's greatest endeavor
I'm kissing shorty in the rain but I'm making her wetter

[Chrisette:]
It beats every single time that I see your cell number showing up on my phone
It beats every single time that you're near me
I'm not ready yet, just leave me alone
I feel it deep in my veins, it's trying to say it's ok
But I ain't ready to go
Without my permission my heart is all on a mission
It's got a mind of it's own

[Bridge:]
I say no and my heart just goes wit it
No control, so I'm trying flow wit it
I'm so gone and it shouldn't have told me
Never should have told my heart

[Chorus]
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh in love
(Never should have told my)
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh in love
(And my heart is saying)
Boom Boom clap clap Boom Boom Boom (and my heart is saying)
Boom Boom clap clap Boom Boom Boom
(I never should have told my heart)
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh in love

[Chrisette:]
Pitta, pitta, padda, padda
Everything is scatta scatta
Something is the matter with me
Boom like the radio
Loud like a stereo

This is how my heart beats
It's like a broke record, but I can't eject it feels like it's on repeat
I got new a confession
Love's my new obsession
My heart's talking to me
Said: boom boom boom

[Bridge:]
I say no and my heart just goes wit it
No control, so I'm trying flow wit it
I'm so gone and it shouldn't have told me
Never should have told my heart

[Chorus:]
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh in love
(Never should have told my)
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh in love
(And my heart is saying)
Boom Boom clap clap Boom Boom Boom (and my heart is saying)
Boom Boom clap clap Boom Boom Boom
(I never should have told my heart)
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh in love

[Rick Ross:]
I'm chilling court side, Jordan six rings
You know we court side till we get our 6 rings
We both on common ground, it ain't a big thing
But when we come around they make it a big thing
Still on the block in that drop chicken box
They asking "what that is?" "is that a different watch?"
When I'm stunt mode, I gotta let the city watch
Or it's the clear pore jet to a chillin spot

[Chorus]
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh in love
(Never should have told my)
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh in love
(And my heart is saying)
Boom Boom clap clap Boom Boom Boom (and my heart is saying)
Boom Boom clap clap Boom Boom Boom
(I never should have told my heart)
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh in love
