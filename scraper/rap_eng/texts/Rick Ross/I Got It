Rick Ross Intro-
I'l get chu higher
I keep the fire
If ur a biter
I'm the provider
22 inch tires
Cuz I'm a rider
Promoted from the trap
I'm the supplier

Razor Verse-
I go nuts for the dough
Krispy kreme
Got paper cuts countin'
Cuz we got crispy cream
Yeah, that mean the cream crispy
Edges kinda sharp for those of y'all who didn't get me
But anyway let's get back to the work
It takes money to make it
So I'm back by the work
I'm strapped
Cuz I know niggas a jack bout the work
Things always go wrong when u thought it was bout to work
I get it in like it's lubed up
Stupid wit the ink
And I'on mean I'm tatooed up
Been doing this and that ain't nothing new bruh
U could buy the board game
And wouldn't have a clue bruh
The hustle is sweet
The hataz, sour
Envy's for the weak
The money's power
We work hard
To move soft
Once we turn the grind on
No days off

Hook-
Whatever you need I got it
U got the clientele
Promise I can supply it
And u can shop around
Bet I got the best prices
I'm tryna tell u whatever u need I got it
[Yeah I got it (Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh)]4x

Rick Ross Verse-
My money come in bags
Bags bigger than books
The benz all black
Black, black as a crook
It's 18 raw
Extra for me to cook
So when I ride buy ya
Holla at cha supplier
Chopper wit a scope
I ain't missin suckaz nope
Takin suckaz dope
Leavin suckaz soak
Shoes on the truck
Move in the dusk
Ten bedrooms u can move in wit us
I might bust'm down
Front'm to the zoe pound
Or leave it in the tape
Just feed'm to'm straight
Look into my mind
U a find a dolla sign
So I'm puttin 29's
On every car I drive
Til the death of me
I do it with a recipe
Whip it real hard
Whip it whip it real hard
U know I got it
So come shop with me
Take my hand
U can walk to the top
