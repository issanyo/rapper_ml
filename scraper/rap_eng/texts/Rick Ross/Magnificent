[Intro: Rick Ross]
Baby, you a true thoroughbred, a born winner
I expect you to be magnificent
It's the boss
It gets no better than this

[Hook: John Legend]
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with, two M's in it
This pimpin' is so magnificent
Stop dreamin' it, I'm livin' it!
Oh I, I can show you
Show you better than I can tell you
Oh I, I can show you
Oh I, oh I, oh I

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm the Magnificent with a sensational style
Far from bein' shallow cause she caught me with a smile
Try to figure out my style, baby that'll take a minute
But if all we got is time, you can't be actin' timid
So we back to playin' tennis, meanin' goin' back and forth
She the one that I adore, so I tried to enter raw
Conscience intervenes, concentratin' on my cream
I'm the king, make a move, pawns all the way to Queens
I'm a don, I'm a boss, I'm a profit, I'm a G
I'm a CEO, which means that I profit off of me
All white tees, still rockin' my Nike Airs
Fresh outta flight school, cause I'm fly right here
Ain't nothin' free, I'm chargin' to breathe air
If it's not on Maybach, really who the hell cares?
My money long, my nigga my money strong
If you ain't gettin' money that mean you done somethin' wrong

[Hook: John Legend]
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with, two M's in it
This pimpin' is so magnificent
Stop dreamin' it, I'm livin' it!
Oh I, I can show you
Show you better than I can tell you
Oh I, I can show you
Oh I, oh I, oh I

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm the Magnificent with a sensational style
Down to all of my automobiles, with no miles
Yellow Corvettes, black rally stripes
And I never phone ahead, all she do is hear the pipes
Project bitches, upscale kittens
Fuck her for a minute, that night we countin' digits
Maybach money so I always had a vision
I would always tell my niggas but, ain't nobody listened
Words work magic, haters wreak havoc
Ain't nothin' on my back, but the delicates of fabrics
I made a transition from the thieves
To the biggest executive Def Jam's ever seen
Lyor's dream, Sean John suit
And a S. Dot ring, Chandon for my crew
Bad hoes in pursuit, Masspike on a two
Gunplay he a glue, goon with a attitude, holla

[Hook: John Legend]
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with, two M's in it
This pimpin' is so magnificent
Stop dreamin' it, I'm livin' it!
Oh I, I can show you
Show you better than I can tell you
Oh I, I can show you
Oh I, oh I, oh I

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I'm the Magnificent with a sensational style
When I decorate a home, marble flowin' like the Nile
Nigga you a clown, here's the number you should dial
Yeah it start with 305, but we end at four pound
"Sak pase" to Zoe Pound, for lifers in O-Town
All them Carol City killers, they're likin' it broke down
Money is a must, tommy guns on a bus
Allan Zamren on the case, so you know what you could suck
Wear red all the time, but really I'm color blind
Wanna catch my attention nigga? Throw up a dollar sign
One time for the Crips, young G's buyin' cribs
And I smoke wit Vice Lords when I visit Mississip'
The game never change, money still a focal
But it's time to rape the game, like Puffy did Total
Like Rev Run in the tub, still smokin'
In memory of Shakir, Boss gotta shout Oakland

[Hook: John Legend]
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with, two M's in it
This pimpin' is so magnificent
Stop dreamin' it, I'm livin' it!
Oh I, I can show you
Show you better than I can tell you
Oh I, I can show you
Oh I, oh I, oh I
