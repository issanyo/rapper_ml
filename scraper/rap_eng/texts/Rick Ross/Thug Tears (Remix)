[Intro: Rick Ross]
It's the biggest boss, Ricky Rozay
You know I gotta break it down like this right? uh

[Verse 1: Rich Ross]
They tried to count me out, it's time to multiply (boss)
The only time I cry another soldier dies (Black Bo)
Shoebox full of money, try to hold it tight (uh)
Sometimes it comes so fast I count it slow at night (uh)
Stars up in the ceiling, we gon' glow tonight
Shine, shine, shine
Boy be ballin', fly to barber, that's just a bless to big
Say your prayers, hold up your hairs, young hustler wipe your tears
Your boy done lost some weight, I fit designer now (uh)
Versace on the buckle, Gucci stylin' down (woo)
Twenty-eight inches for when we ride around (woo)
How you still ballin' still standin' out of bounds? (woo, uh)

[Chorus: Demarie King & Tirzah]
I remember them long nights (I remember them long nights)
Mama cried in the room (mama cried in the room)
Granny worked them long nights (them long nights)
The lord said we gotta move (lord said we gotta move)
Eviction notes on the door (eviction notes on the door)
'Cause our rent is past due (no no no no no no)
If you been through the struggle (oh no no no)
These thug tears for you, yeah

[Verse 2: Mistah F.A.B.]
Shed a thug tear 'til my eyes dry
For all the prophets and the poets and the wise guys
In my dream mama was in heaven, seen her walkin' to me
Woke up smilin' to an angel voice, Libby talkin' to me
Thug tears for all my niggas that done lost they life
Nike boxes full of letters, my niggas fighting life
Pray these diamonds replace the pain, at Highline coppin' ice
Lil bro took one to the brain at Highland, lost his life
Rest in peace to Quise, that's Frost City
I'm gon' pray for his sins, I hope Allah get him
God's plan, God willing, help this lost city
I remixed Thug Tears, now I got Ross with me (uh)
All the money in the world can't bring my mama back
Ashes and urns and rolling hills where my partners at
That's why I'm shedding thug tears for all these lost souls
And I just hope we meet again at the crossroads

[Chorus: Demarie King & Tirzah]
I remember them long nights (I remember them long nights)
Mama cried in the room (mama cried in the room)
Granny worked them long nights (them long nights)
The lord said we gotta move (lord said we gotta move)
Eviction notes on the door (eviction notes on the door)
'Cause our rent is past due (no no no no no no)
If you been through the struggle (oh no no no)
These thug tears for you, yeah

[Verse 3: Philthy Rich]
I cried for fifty nine nights when Dre Feddi died (swear to God)
A lot of murder on my mind, a lot of homicide (swear to God)
I kept quiet when they had me in homicide (I ain't say shit)
They say they love you but ain't slide when they homie died (it's Philthy)
Young and reckless, in the kitchen, tryna get the extras (thirty-six)
The OG's was giftin' game but we ain't get the message (uh-uh)
In the streets with no guidance, that's an early death wish (it is)
Locked up when Woods died, my bitch sent the message (hello?)
When I think about Chad, this shit so sad (rest in peace Chad)
Wish my nigga was here now to see me in my bag (I wish he was)
To have my niggas here with me I'll give up my last (give up all this shit)
Rest in peace my nigga Frost, we throwin' up the last, it's Philthy

[Verse 4: Mozzy]
I'm with the pop up, Hell Gang get the job done
Why is you talkin' like you is a fellow felon and you not one?
Gotta go and catch a highway, gotta drop somethin' 'round here
Nigga get popped up 'round here, they doin' walk ups 'round here
Yeah, yeah, my nigga locked up for an M
I was locked up when Lil Diamond died, I was locked up for Shakim
When I throw it up it mean Hell Gang but it's pure love for the brims
Started banging as a young boy, couldn't get the ball in the rim
I got an eight ball for the low, that shit mainey how a nigga live
I had to hustle all on my own, that shit made me how a nigga is
Yeah, we was in the streets heavy, I'm tryna pay the rest of this rent
We finally made it out of that shit
We finally made it out of that bitch

[Chorus: Demarie King & Tirzah]
I remember them long nights (I remember them long nights)
Mama cried in the room (mama cried in the room)
Granny worked them long nights (them long nights)
The lord said we gotta move (lord said we gotta move)
Eviction notes on the door (eviction notes on the door)
'Cause our rent is past due (no no no no no no)
If you been through the struggle (oh no no no)
These thug tears for you, yeah
