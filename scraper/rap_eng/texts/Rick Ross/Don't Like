[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I seen a homeboy die in cold blood
Eyes rolled in his head wasn't no love
His momma sold pussy daddy was a fiend
He from a place where niggas don't believe in dreams
Niggas snorting powder (Maybach Music)
I seen a homeboy die in cold blood
Eyes rolled in his head, wasn't no love
His momma sold pussy, daddy was a fiend
He from a place where niggas don't believe in dreams
Niggas snorting powder, get your head right
Get your dick sucked, sittin' at the red light
Now you catchin' cases
Talkin home invasions
How you get a bond
How the fuck you playin'
Can't be playin games on the home field
Open up like a YAGHHHH, when that dome peel, YAGHHH
We didn't have shit when we went to school
Now it's flatscreens up in every room
Nigga do the math bucket full of crab
Tub full of money candy on the slab
Teflon underneath my fresh tag
Bal harbour walkin out with 40 bags
I could fuck a model for an autograph
8 cars, still make her call a cab
Shoutout to Def Jam
Shoutout to Warner Brothers
Shoutout to Dope Boys
We all need each other
I’m in Anguilla, I’m smoking killer
We run the game, pussy boy go cry a river

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound: that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathin' like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I'd never hit a woman, never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife'
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eatin' good: vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissin' girls ‘cause it's hot, right?
But unless they use a strap-on, then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
We hangin' out that window: it's about to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man, that nigga nice
Shout out to L-E-P, Jay Boogie, right?
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? Right?!

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
Don't like, don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
Fake Gucci, that's that shit that I don't like
Smokin' on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
Screamin', "Sosa, that's that nigga that I like!"
I don't want relations, I just want one night
‘Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like
I got tats up on my arm ‘cause this shit is life
And I stunt so much in clothes ‘cause I'm livin' life
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealin' light
Bitch, I'm high off life, got me feelin' right
Bitch, I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like!
And, bi-bi-bitch, we GBE, we just go on sight

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
I done sold purple, I done sold white
Runnin' outta work, that's that shit I don't like
She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice
She blowin' up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em, just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, another thirty for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas!

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
