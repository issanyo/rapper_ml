[Verse 1]
When you get a lil' paper, get ready for haters
They standing in line, they all suffer from vapors
I got me a ghost, I took off the tint
Bitch look at my face, I'm a grown ass man
I'm buying real estate and I'm building my plans
Can't name a realer place, going gram for gram
And all the killers hate, know who the fuck I am
Look in a nigga face, watch me count my grams
My dog my trigger mate, and we bout them games
I'm talking trigger play never safe for lames
Just beat another charge, made 'em drop that case
My lawyers going hard, a nigga versus the state
Just bought another car, had to drop that top
For 200 dollars, she'll suck that cock
Cause when you seen with me I'mma up that stock
I got that green with me, Gucci got those blocks
A nigga cheese dripping, I like my nachos hot
As far as green niggas, yeah you might get got
Breaking down my key, trying to see me the most
Greenhouse on the couch, niggas seeing me toast
Niggas making the threats, you could put 'em on Twitter
But out of respect, I handle mine like a killer
I'm running the city like a pair of new Js
Maybe the patent 11s, I got these hoes in a daze
Panamera parade, sippin Cir'c lemonade
Baby, drop me a eighth and baby boy straight
In the back of the ghost, I can hear no whispers
In the back of your mind, you wanna be that nigga
(Maybach Music)

[Outro: DJ Scream]
Know I said it to y'all once
And I'ma say it to y'all again
See, this right here?
This ain't no ordinary music, nigga
This the finest music on the planet
Nigga, this that Maybach Music
Rick Ross, Rich Forever
Now, turn the fucking volume up!
