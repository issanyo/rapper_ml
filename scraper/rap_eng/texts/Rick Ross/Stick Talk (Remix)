[Intro: Future]
Took a shot of Henny, I've been going brazy, brazy
They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk
They know we talk that lick talk, that lick talk

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
AK-47 bussin’ it got these niggas duckin’
Fuckin’ two jewish bitches while I got “Black Dollar” bumpin’
Singles from the night before, the bottles on the table
New money get that by design, it’s time to move the label
Cut off the phones well protected in my white house
Two way with Jigga nigga show you what this white ‘bout
Bring the drama and we gon' wear them til they wiped out
Well orchestrated, extorted with the lights out
Not in school, follow the rules for them other niggas
Not allowed to ride in the coupe if you didn't suffer with us
Pussy nigga heard they squeeze you for a couple millions
Competition get devoured, you better get familiar
Slaughter niggas like cattle, killas from overseas
The vodla [?] on my sleeve, niggas just wanna chief
Send the boy a bottle, wack 'em in the club over
You fucking with the mob, I'm richer than the club owner
100, 200, 300
400, 500, cop the key


[Hook: Future]
I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

[Verse 2: Future]
I'mma tell a lie under oath
I can see it in your eyes, you're going broke
Oxycontin got her with a body count (sak pase)
Riding in a car I barely can pronounce
Ordered up a chauffeur, told him "ride me round the whole world"
I was on the E-way with that molly and that old girl
Get a little cheaper, you could win
Hit it little harder, get the Benz

[Hook: Future]
10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the seat ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk
I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

[Bridge: Future]
Fully loaded whip to fully loaded clips
Fucking with my niggas, I'll smoke a zip
Red eyes, and I got them Zoes with me
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

[Pre-Hook: Future]
Took a shot of Henny, I've been going brazy, brazy
They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk
They know we talk that lick talk, that lick talk

[Partial Hook: Future]
10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the seat ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk
