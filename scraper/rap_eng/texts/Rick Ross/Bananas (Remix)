You ain't gotta turn the bass up
We gon' make the neighbors wake up
And when we done, we gon' do it again
So ain't no reason to be putting on your makeup
Go ahead and let your hair down
Ooh, I wanna pull your hair out
I take a bow after I put it down
Take a shout and let that air out

You gonna love it by the time I'm through
Cause once I get it, girl
Watch what I do with it
You gonna want to be committed..
The sex is bananas - bananas..
Between me and you
The sex is bananas, and you like getting fruit

You should go on and let me cut ya
We'll get started on the sofa
They gon' end up putting me in the pen
For going in, I be beating up the chocha
I'mma have you running back bare
Once I get you to my Batcave
SE Lexus, automatic, GPS
You gon' always wanna tell me where you at, babe

You gonna love it by the time I'm through
Cause once I get it, girl
Watch what I do with it
You gonna want to be committed..
The sex is bananas - bananas..
Between me and you
The sex is bananas, and you like getting fruit

Shorty be the bomb, she's my red-bottomed blonde
Red-bottomed bag, I'm just a well-paid don
New 2-seater, but the top already gone
We made love all night, but we could top that..
Sex is bananas, I took her shopping in the sky
Lou Vuittons on your boy - you know that money multiply
She fell in love with a thug on the 1st date
