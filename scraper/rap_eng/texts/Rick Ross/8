[Chorus: Rick Ross]
8, you wanna try a real nigga?
8, I’mma show you how we deal with ya
8, she wanna fuck a dope dealer
8, or keep fuckin’ with them broke niggas
8, 8, 8, 8, 8
I'm gettin money if you hating
8, 8, 8, 8, 8
I’m gettin’ stripes if you hate on me, always 8

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Big big bully, lockjaw
Big, fully off in my top draw
Big bullets, big topped off
Pussy nigga knocked off
Living legend, Silver Seven
Beef for dinner, pill for breakfast
Head trigger, no rogaine
Gripping oakgrain with some stolen cocaine

[Verse 2: Saskilla]
Let me tell you what it ain't tho
Beg friends what it ain't tho
(Phone ring) ATL on a first class flight
Holla Johnny Cinco
That's a real nigga, that's my nigga
A'ma still tell a nigga what it ain't tho
Breed up a sket what it ain't tho
Snitch on my friends what it ain't tho
So let me tell you what it is tho
New money ink well what it is tho
A'ma fuck a nigga up from the intro
Take 'em to a cashpoint, make 'em put a pin code
You think London ain't gully? You think London ain't gully?
A got a thousand skinheads at Old Kent Road
That will tell a man cum on then sonny
Like nuttin' ain't funny

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
8, you wanna try a real nigga?
8, I’mma show you how we deal with ya
8, she wanna fuck a dope dealer
8, or keep fuckin’ with them broke niggas
8, 8, 8, 8, 8
I'm gettin money if you hating
8, 8, 8, 8, 8
I’m gettin’ stripes if you hate on me, always 8

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
You pulled a gun on my homie you better have one for me
Ain't no running up on me, my new Versace fatigue
Boobie got with that work what Dre just got for his Beats
I expect for these songs to keep me hot with the seats
All i want is the money, the master key to these riches
These pussies keep hating, I'mma hit you with inches
Get my nigga a kite, told my warden we did it
Put these stacks on these books cause I'm too busy to finish

[Verse 4: Saskilla]
Let me tell you what it is tho
Gimme grime worldwide what it is tho
USA get used to the tempo
Man are gonna blow like west coast endo
We got coke, we got deez
We got H, we got B
Run rap and we run from police
Your dawgs ain't real, man are crawling wit fleas

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
8, you wanna try a real nigga?
8, I’mma show you how we deal with ya
8, she wanna fuck a dope dealer
8, or keep fuckin’ with them broke niggas
8, 8, 8, 8, 8
I'm gettin money if you hating
8, 8, 8, 8, 8
I’m gettin’ stripes if you hate on me, always 8

[Verse 5: Scrufizzer & Maxsta]
Don't let me get vex
Put you in a chokehold with my headset
I'm an animal, vet, get ready, get set Talking but you ain't buss any lengs yet
Let me set off the pace
Told them already they can't F up the base
Give them street crime UK, I'll mess up the place
Backshots make your girl pull her dress up her waist
Max, lemme kill 'em with the rhyming blinding
Everybody shining, rhyming, I'll divide em
Man are gaza, true, not a marger yout
You can't bar wit Max, can't bar with Scru
I got a brand new flow called sting
This one's deep, it'll make your head spin
Simple bars I am projecting
No, you don't get narn, you start molesting

[Verse 6: Gunplay]
Don Logan
Talking vulgar
trap house
No AC torn sofa
You niggas know my motherfucking pedigree
I'm Gunplay, I'm everything I said I'd be

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
8, you wanna try a real nigga?
8, I’mma show you how we deal with ya
8, she wanna fuck a dope dealer
8, or keep fuckin’ with them broke niggas
8, 8, 8, 8, 8
I'm gettin money if you hating
8, 8, 8, 8, 8
I’m gettin’ stripes if you hate on me, always 8
