[Intro: Sikness]
Put my county on my back let em know I'm real
Put my county on my back let em know I'm real

[Verse 1: B-Eazy (Kid Dream-Away)]
Well they know me as B-Eazy, right now I'm on my psychedelic shit
Dark shades, big dreams that no one could even think of
Living in that BLACK FORREST where niggas couldn't survive in
I'm zonin' I'm vibin' these lame niggas they jivin'
These girls tell me they love me but I know that they lying
So I pay them no attention, gotta move on to the next thing
Put on for my county, and put on for VA
Can't forget where I come from or all of my love ones
When I'm chasin' these dreams tryna get this doe
Keeping it real is all I know
When it comes to this music I never stop, I just go go go
Think about it all day, I'm a make it, you'll see

[Hook]
Put my county on my back let em know I'm real
Its somethin' I ain't gotta say they can feel
Never fade away from the real me, always keep it one hundred and always be me
They may change yeah, they may change, but I'm a always be the same, always be the same
They may change yeah, they may change, but I'm a always be the same, always be the same

[Verse 2: Sikness]
Layin' on a purple cloud pillow, just chillin'
Can't describe the feelin, bout to take off leave a hole in the celilin'
Fiends for my music cause my shit dope, only lookin' up like my neck broke
Or like a cloud of smoke, gasoline and flame at the end of the rope
Fuckin' clown but its not a joke
Pump water gun in shawty pussy let it super soak
Yeah I'm feelin' myself no materbation
My head blown up I need deflation
Frustion steady pasen and waitin'
To put a end to the bullshittin' and perpertatin'
Me and Eazy in a leauge of our own, use to think my mind was gone
But its clear to see that we on

[Hook]
