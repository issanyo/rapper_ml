[Verse 1: Luke James]
I'm a man of simple knowledge
She's a woman that's prone to violence
It used to be something beautiful
Red flags, regardless
And love used to be a vehicle
But now there's too much mileage
So please forgive me
Cause I never meant to hurt you daughter
But on the real, hey she
Sheâ€™s using everything you taught her

[Pre-Chorus: Luke James]
And this lyric is a miracle
And a blessing, and a problem
This lyric is a miracle
And a blessing, and a problem

[Chorus: Luke James]
And all I'm trying say is we got options
Baby, all I'm saying is we got options
Red or green? So what's it gonna be?
Cause I never been a fan of running
Let's fight the pain, and maybe we'll see
But you can never see the future coming
So, so girl, I'm just thinking about our options
Girl, I'm just thinking about our options
Hold up

[Verse 2: Luke James]
So, so far gone, I'm barely breathing
She's holding on, guess she's got her reasons
It really hurts to see what we've become
And that's why I'm leaving
Betrayed all the good we've ever done in one single evening
So please forgive me
Cause I'd never wanna hurt my daughter
But on the real ay you
You hurt me more than I ever thought you could

[Pre-Chorus: Luke James]
And this lyric is a miracle
And a blessing, not a problem
This lyric is a miracle
And a blessing, not a problem

[Chorus: Luke James]
I can't believe I said that we had options
I never should have said we had options, baby
Red or green? So what's it gonna be?
Cause I never been a fan of running
Let's fight the pain, and maybe we'll see
But you can never see the future coming

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
(Hey Luke let me talk to em! Check)
Started outta college girl now she in the model world
Screaming she gonna make her way rocking all kind of fur
Her friends wanna see her fail, but she got a mind made
Cool she an outcast, big boy he an Andre
Talking about myself though, heard that I was self-centered
Apologies to my ex, on to the next sentence
My new ones say I'm like that, parties at the spot live
Heels out of LA, we lit up after nighttime
Life is shorter than a flick, maybe we should make a scene
All positions came through, meaning rated A to Z
Hanging from the shower rod, maybe we can skip that
But you know that's how It go, Fat boy always with that
Untouchable my clique is, Money long as my dick is
Shawty handle her business, she the realest (boss)
Hundred stacks in Bel-Air, Black bottle, black mail
You lookin' at who run the city
Luke James run it wit me

[Chorus: Luke James]
So maybe taking life is not an option
Oh no, maybe taking life is not an option
Oh no no no baby
Red or green? So what's it gonna be?
Cause I never been fan of running
Let's fight the pain, and maybe we'll see
But you can never see the future coming
Girl, I'm just thinking about our options
