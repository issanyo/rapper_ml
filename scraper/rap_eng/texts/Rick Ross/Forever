[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
The moment arise when she opened her mind body tumble till she opened her eyes

[Hook]
I'm never letting go
If you're never letting go
I'd lost everything if I lose you baby
I'm never letting go
If you're never letting go
They say nothing's forever
But I want you forever baby
Forever, I want this forever
Forever, I want you forever, baby
Forever, I want this forever
They say nothing's forever
But I want you forever

[Verse 2: Mario]
I don't know what it is
With us
But it's obvious
We don't want to let it go
I don't know how it'd be without you
I'm scared and I just don't want to let it show
Got money, but I still least be lonely
Crib on the beach, get you the key
Just tell me I'll be there
I'm sorry I didn't know, that you've been waiting so long
Now nothing I can say
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mario]
I'm never letting go
Don't want you to let us go
Stay here with me baby
Ohhhh
I just wanna love you till you scream
Say it baby ohhhh
We don't have to play no games
I'll love you forever
[Hook]
