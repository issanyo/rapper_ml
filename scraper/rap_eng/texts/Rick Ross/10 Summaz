[Intro: 2 Chainz]
A nigga hot, like ten summers
Ten chains on, walking in a Benihana
My money long, like ten Hummers
I been getting to the money the last ten summers

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Ten summers, ten summers
I been getting to the money the last ten summers
My money long, like ten Hummers
That nigga full of shit, somebody call the plumber
A nigga hot, like ten summers
Ten chains on, walking in a Benihana
My money long, like ten Hummers
I been getting to the money the last ten summers

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
You know I keep it G, like ten hundreds
I won't fuck that nasty bitch wearing ten condoms
The chain cost me like ten Hondas
2Pac, dear ma, I'm tryna kill something
You know I do this on the regular, I'm telling ya
I smoke loud though, I don't smoke no regular
Dear John letter to all my competitors:
I dumped my last girlfriend because she wasn't wet enough
If I hear about a lick, I'm like "bet it up"
I got a young bitch that could set it up
Summertime, I'm about whatever, bruh, and
I'mma need a handicap sticker cause my whip is dumb

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fell in love with that money, she fell in love with my schwag
Too fly for these niggas but we knee-deep in that trap
You just getting that bread, since Bin Laden been dead
Killing these niggas, wrist might get time in the feds
I'm stunting, Evel Knievel, dirty Sprite by the liter
Let that top down on my Beamer til' I'm tired of balling like Tila
On the books just like De La, get you knocked right out your FILA
Have your neighborhood drug dealer, just shoot yo' ass and peel out
You know I got the streets hotter than the Gates of Hell
Six for the nine-piece but you make it twelve
It's simple math, yeah, we got the yola
20 million strong, MMG taking over

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Ten summers, ten baby mommas
Yeah, I got my baby girl tatted on my stomach
Ten thousand worth of tats like an es√©
I got a bag of pills, who wanna play them ex-games?
I do this for the trap cause I'm a trap star
Inside of my car look like a laptop
Outside of my car look like a crack spot and
If you think you're lucky, it depends on your crap shot
Baby, let me put my stick up in your matchbox
All my verses hot, you might pass out
Got your girl smoking loud with her ass out and
If you didn't know then, bitch, I'm the man now
Hot

[Hook]
