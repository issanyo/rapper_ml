[Verse 1: Capital Cities]
Hello?
You are the one I wanna take out on the weekend
Oh, hi!
Do not pretend you wanna end what we got going
Okay
How about a movie?
Baby, tell me that you're free then
I'm sorry but I think I got Tuesday and Wednesday open

[Pre-Chorus: Capital Cities]
She's got things to do everyday of the week
While I'm just playing hide and desperately seek
I wait around the clock, but her calendar is blocked
I'm a hard place
And she's a rock, she's a rock

[Chorus: Capital Cities & Rick Ross]
She's my Girl Friday
She's my Girl Friday
I'm her Boy Wednesday
I'm her Boy Wednesday
She's my Girl Friday
She's my Girl Friday (It's the biggest boss)
I'm her Boy Wednesday
I'm her Boy Wednesday (Yeah, I love this)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I think we fell in love outside a Wingstop (we did)
Put the joint out when I hopped right out the t-top
You're looking like something that I could deal with
Get between your thighs, maybe have that happy meal with (yeah)
Either way I got to put you on the calendar
Take you on a tour so somebody call my manager
Biggest boss got my shirt off, off at Coachella
Biggest blunts, everybody got their own fetish
So we at the concert at the frat house
Drink with live music 'til we passed out
Everybody rocking with the big boss
Let's roll another joint soon as class out
Said this year we wanna do it bigger
So you came and got the right nigga
On stage and I'm looking for the best titties
Put your middle finger up for Capital Cities

[Chorus: Capital Cities & Rick Ross]
She's my Girl Friday
She's my Girl Friday (It's the biggest event of the year)
I'm her Boy Wednesday (It's the biggest boss)
I'm her Boy Wednesday (Capital Cities)
She's my Girl Friday (Put your motherfucking middle fingers in the air)
She's my Girl Friday
I'm her Boy Wednesday (Hold 'em motherfuckers up)
I'm her Boy Wednesday (Woooooooo)
She's my Girl Friday
She's my Girl Friday
I'm her Boy Wednesday
I'm her Boy Wednesday
She's my Girl Friday
She's my Girl Friday (Boss)
I'm her Boy Wednesday
