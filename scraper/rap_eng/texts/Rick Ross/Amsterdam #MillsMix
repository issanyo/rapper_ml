[Intro: F. Mills]
Yeah, love this joint right here
This beat take me somewhere man
Let me tap this real quick

[Verse 1: F. Mills]
Certain women I have entered
Called me cold hearted
Left em freezing in the winter
Only one since I started
Imma see if you remember
I was with her she departed
Shit just happened in December
The gang that I'm a member
Against me and witness temper
I'm tipping her while she flipping her body she need a mentor
Cash in my fender my cars they are never rentals
I'm far from a fucking simp
I'm a part of a fucking click
Of retarded, these niggas mental's
Is scarred
Is it a God or I'm partying in a temple
I'm worshipping is it simple
Regarding this, did my part
Am I barred making a nickel
I'm throwing it shit just trickling down
Why am I missing the target, I'm just depositing down
So I just park it and smile
Do this regardless my town
A bunch of heartless them individuals hunting you down
Now just imagine, they searching for you just lost and not found
Know we not far from you
Ross

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
I'm Berry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo, so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Royal blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm living through these beats
Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks
Burning Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf

[Verse 2: F. Mills]
Yeah, new team same dream
Visualizing them goals that we're reaching and shit it brings
Haters they try and get ya, but run ins they go unseen
My niggas stay toting things
But personally I keep the beam
Working it ain't a scheme
If your purpose is for the team
Worth it cuz the shit it show on the surface on the scene
I'm trying to live forever open curtains on the screen
Shit they trying to hurt us now, but they just chirping in between
Talking amongst the fiends
Addicted to the fast life
Cars, money machines
It don't matter looking past price
I sit and reminisce about them past nights
How can they say they fly
Look at our gas price
And even when she cry I tell her ask Christ
I'm non religious if I tried its like I crashed twice
Baptized as a shorty still live a crass life
I guess its due to those worries serving that brass life

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
I'm Berry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo, so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Royal blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm living through these beats
Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks
Burning Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf
