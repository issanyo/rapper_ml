18 wheeler came in, and it ain´t enough
The crew break the whole thing down, then we weigh it up
Then you take the champagne bottle and you shake, shake, shake it up
You see them niggas made a little money but them Niggas ain´t made enough
I can´t hear you what you sayin?, i think you breakin up
Hoe we get on the brake them niggas stay layin´ up
I may have caught a couple cases but my Jewish lawyer ate ´em up, ate ´em up, ate ´em up
Since way back when them niggas been fake as fuck
I put the 2 into the 4 show you niggas how to double up
To be a boss you gotta take a loss lil nigga toughen up

[Momohcobain]
Im on my BlackBag shit pull up with a bad bitch and i been all over the world
My back so thick and my Bankroll thick that i end up on top of your girl
And the club so lit we like a 100 bottles in, on the couch like we on top of the world
Pull up in a fast whip and my neckpiece thick and i´m dressed in designer apparel

[Refrain]
I´ma shake the champaigne bottle ( x8)

The Biggest
Best selling dope boy look at the timepiece
Lw-fade pretty bitch she lookin (?)
Fast money, quick cash. Muhammad Ali in me
I´m in the hills in Hollywood and she swallowin´me
Bodies droppin´and all these niggas still hollerin´ at me
I´m postin´pictures since all you niggas still following me
Cocaine, and it came with my name on it
Went out of business all these lame niggas ain´t want it
6 cribs in 6 states, get misplaced
600 hunnid, new stashbox with fake plates
Big money, i get ´em on and get me a day
Foster child, the same one (?)

[Refrain]

I´ma shake the champaigne bottle ( x8)
