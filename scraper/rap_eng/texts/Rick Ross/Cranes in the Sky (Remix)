[Verse 1 : Rick Ross]
Uhhh
Diamonds in the piece get you crossed up
Hydroponic lettuce on the boss lungs
I just won a medal on the long jump
Still racing through the ghetto where you won't come
Dirty money so I got a laundromat
Thorn says my niggas rally under that
Cancun, I got pictures back in '98
Hustle in the streets is really give or take
RossFit I put her up on hot yoga
Wheat grass, shot of ginger, pot smoker
I love her attitude and that new body suit
I love a graduate who can get kinda loose
Crib so big cranes in the sky
Standing on a stage chains side to side
I fuck her on the back if she don't wanna ride
I bring another one I like the traumatize
Wings stop a nigga wanna number nine
That atomic bomb get hotter than the summertime
I maybe get your number on some other time
I maybe get a mutual to give you one of mine

[Verse 2: Solange & Rick Ross]
I tried to drink it away(Ricky Rozay , Uhh)
I tried to put one in the air
I tried to dance it away
I tried to change it with my hair

[Verse 3: Solange]
I ran my credit card bill up
Thought a new dress would make it better
I tried to work it away
But that just made me even sadder

[Verse 4: Solange]
I tried to keep myself busy
I ran around in circles
Think I made myself dizzy
I slept it away, I sexed it away
I read it away
Away

[Refrain 1: Solange]
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away

[Hook 1: Solange]
Well it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds

[Verse 5: Solange]
I tried to run it away
Thought then my head be feeling clearer
I traveled 70 states
Thought moving round make me feel better

[Verse 6: Solange]
I tried to let go my lover
Thought if I was alone then maybe I could recover
To write it away or cry it away
Don't you cry baby
Away

[Refrain 1: Solange]
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away

[Hook 2: Solange]
But it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal...

[Refrain 2: Solange]
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
