[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Give a nigga leg room, that's what I said to him
Recognize this face, we do the peace sign to 'em
Niggas standing and whispering, I'm like "fuck what they talking"
Stay cool, clutch guns while I'm walking
Hope they stop and duck while I'm sparking
Introduce their mom to a homicide sergeant
Flaming your apartment, slug through your carpet
Two bricks of scale, top shelf in your closet
You ratting on the cartel which was nonsense
A code of silence, I feel a bitch should know
If you open your mouth I feel a bitch should go
Hit the quick vote, okay, slit your throat
Make sure here she's not fit to flow
This the vote, cool, nigga
My fellas, this ain't something that your bitch should know
If they asking about me, hey, I kick the flow
It's hit and go, hit the do', hit the dough
Hit the dro, get some mo'
Flip a bird, but I gotta spit some mo'
Sip some Mo' in the 8-4, yo, bitch, lay low
Any debts I pay fo', spray fo'
Satisfying the mix with the yayo
And I was locked up on the 8th flo'

[Verse 2: Noah]
I'm walking out the house while it's bright and early
Just hung up the phone, [?] is ready to serve me
Gotta meet 'em by the dock, see, I buy the boatload
Don't trust no niggas, but my vatos loco
When you're me pistols are rarely needed
With these prices I'm strictly business and I mean it
Seven gram a block, I'm moving seventy in seven days
Got seven distributes in seven different states
We money mates, we never break the [?]
We get your tongue froze from that uncut taste
We millionaire thugs making exchanges in sway lucks
Poke us in on distribution with cassettes and drugs
Never ever gunplay, that's for the broke, I let my mouth teach
Walking with a two point three in the bag South Beach
Making deals, spending expensive wheels for thrills
Counting money so late, man, you gotta pop a pill
Receiving money and load, copping kilos from boats
Before this, you know our steelo was strictly cutting [?]
Extortion involving bloody ransom notes
Now it's kingpin folks and hundred pound cocaine quotes

[Hook: Noah]
It's a bird bath, we move a hundred a week
The player price which can never be beat
Not by a nigga on these city streets
Trying to push a two gram just to get on his feet
This is a bath of birds served by [?]
Prices you never heard, yeah, my flake is nice
So what I'm young and I keep the caine?
If you come up short that's a bullet to the brain

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I could break down a brick
Never *snorting noises* even though I stay around the shit
Spray around some shit, bound to get surround your clique
You was looking for respect, but you found a clip
From the sound, shit, the fo' pound found your rib
Have to wet your crib so I can drown your kids
My nigga Jabar who down on a bid
Copped this bitch a Benz to get around for the kids
Y'all fake hustlers, busters, I'll cut ya
You signing to who? So fuck ya
Musher when I clutch the bitch boy gutter
Box cutter, move with every word you utter

[Verse 4: Noah]
A bird bathtub, you cats will puff herb slaps
By 5 pm I've been in my third [?]
Serving crabs, elevated to birds
Calimate the first, celebrated then splurged
On iceberg and slow, invite birds
More than nine birds,you saying the right words
My sight blurred with teflon light [?]
Twenty karat ice work, Prada shoes, nice shirt
Still know it's a pill strapped, cock back, kill tracks
Steel bats, peel windshields back for that crack
Still rap, block niggas feel that, yeah yeah, feel that

[Hook]
