I know you Miss Me
I know you Miss Me

[Chorus:]
They say the city ain't the same in a night like die
Since T.I.'s inside like the streets been quiet
I know you Miss Me
I know you Miss Me
I know I Know
The say the dugs ain't ballin' and the dubs ain't fallin'
Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay
I know you Miss Me
I know you Miss Me
I know I know

[Verse 1:]
Yeah
You know I do it for the city and everybody descending
The generals and lieutenants salute high representors
Since I've been sittin' a minute no-everybody be missin'
Me walking off in the club
Gettin' everybody attention
When I'm out record with spinnin'
They start it from the beginning
Get bottles of Christian Remy
And pass it out to the women
Pull out a stack of 20
Throw it up to the ceiling
Watch it fall to the floor
Start throwin' some more
Has anybody you know
Whatever part it you go
With me in the VIP
Know that shit was outta control
If I pull up in a Mercedes
I hop in out of the road
Continue hatin' but hey
I'm the fly-est guy that you know
Ay, East coast, West coast, me in way south
I keep a fire marshal at the go stressed out
Mine stretched around the corner, shut the whole event down
Been a minute in the city since it really went down, man

[Chorus:]
They say the city ain't the same in a night like die
Since T.I.'s inside like the streets been quiet
I know you Miss Me
I know you Miss Me
I know I Know
The say the dugs ain't ballin and the dubs ain't fallin
Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay
I know you Miss Me
I know you Miss Me
I know I know

[Verse 2:]
I'm gettin' calls every evening, sayin' the streets need me
I'm at it just as soon as I make it pimpin' believe me
Niggas talkin' greasy but they don't wanna see me
They know where to find me, soon as they release me
Remember me and Jeezy, at least once a week we
Hit the strip club, show these niggas how to treat freeze
One stack, two stacks, three stacks, four
Nigga, five Stacks, go tell me bring ten more
And Lamborghinis and Apollos
They see me they screamin' holla
The robbers follow the ballers, so peg it soon my proudest
Still ain't nobody hotter, I put that on my daughter
Long as I be sittin' still, niggas still ain't cower
Atlanta you know I run it, everybody is Spanish
They gotta stay in their houses like everybody were punished
Tell them they to quit frontin' and them suckas sit down
Let em know the king comin' and he shut this shit down

[Chorus:]
They say the city ain't the same in a night like die
Since T.I.'s inside like the streets been quiet
I know you Miss Me
I know you Miss Me
I know I Know
The say the dugs ain't ballin and the dubs ain't fallin'
Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay
I know you Miss Me
I know you Miss Me
I know I know

[Bridge:]
And every time I take the city back
And wear my crown, nigga give me that, that, that
I know you Miss Me
I know you Miss Me
I know I know
And I do my thang
Stack my millis
Now it time for me to bring back my city, ay
I know you Miss Me
I know you Miss Me
I know I know

[Chorus:]
They say the city ain't the same in a night like die
Since T.I.'s inside like the streets been quiet
I know you Miss Me
I know you Miss Me
I know I Know
The say the dugs ain't ballin and the dubs ain't fallin'
Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay
I know you Miss Me
I know you Miss Me
I know I know
