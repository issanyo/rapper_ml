[Intro: Rick Ross]
You know gettin' money, becomin' a young millionaire
You can lose sight of the things that is important to you

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'd never trade my old girl for all the money in the world
I'd never trade my daughter Toy for all the money in the world
I'd never trade my only boy for all the money in the world
I put my last name first
I can hear my daddy sayin' "lil' nigga go get 'em"
Passed in '99 cancer all in his liver
Shit different since we last spoke, his son's a lil richer
I'd never rap again if I could tell him that I miss him
Why the fuck I own the world when I can't share it with him
Bust his ass his whole life, just want to break bread with him
Cryin' in my mansion as I'm holdin' on his picture
It's a cold and lonely world, I'm flyin' solo on you niggas
Bein' the only boy, definition of a man
All the money in the world still not a big enough advance
Still all the money in the world still not big enough advance
For me to turn my back on me bein' the man that I am

[Hook: Rick Ross & (Raphael Saadiq)]
Turn off the lights (turn off the lights)
Take a ride with me (take a ride with me)
I wanna see you smile (I wanna see you smile)
It's a fantasy (it's a fantasy)
La-la la la la (la-la la la la)
La la la la (la la la la)
La-la la la la (la-la la la la)
La la la la (la la la la)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Momma gettin' older feelin' pains in her shoulder
I gotta stay focused and remain her little soldier
Brace a few wishfuls and the streets begin the whisper
Prayin' for you niggas still stockin' up my pistols
Lil nigga gettin' murdered and buried in all-white
Eighth grade school y'all figure that's alright
Tryna figure out where I'm goin' with my life
As I'm steppin' on the brake and hangin' a sharp right
Did my thing in the streets, seen in the streets
See me at the park on the swing with my niece
Watch chipped up, still won't switch up
First time singin', so you gotta turn that bitch up

[Hook: Rick Ross & (Raphael Saadiq)]
Turn off the lights (turn off the lights)
Take a ride with me (take a ride with me)
I wanna see you smile (I wanna see you smile)
It's a fantasy (it's a fantasy)
La-la la la la (la-la la la la)
La la la la (la la la la)
La-la la la la (la-la la la la)
La la la la (la la la la)

[Verse 3: Raphael Saadiq]
Oh man, when I close my eyes
I can see you about a million times
It's true over and over, over and over
Yeah, but then again, it kinda makes me laugh
Cause you're the one that put me on this path
I guess I gotta keep rollin' strong
I feel I can't go wrong
Cause I can hear you walkin' with me
I can hear you talkin' to me
I know you hear them sayin' "La-la la la la la-la"
Come on now

[Bridge: Raphael Saadiq & Rick Ross]
La-la la la la
La-la la la
La-la la la la
La la la la

[Verse 4: Raphael Saadiq]
Now come and take a ride with me
I really wanna take a walk wit' you
It'd be cool to have a drink with you, think with you
Now come and take a ride with me
There's so much to say
Old memories won't go away, go away, go away

[Bridge: Raphael Saadiq]
Old memories won't go away
I remember them like it was yesterday
That time never felt so good
Can't forget about you, man I never would
Old memories won't go away
I remember them like it was yesterday
That time never felt so good
Can't forget about you, man I never would
Old memories won't go away
I remember them like it was yesterday
That time never felt so good
Can't forget about you, man I never would

[Outro: Raphael Saadiq]
Say you never never would see, I never would
Just can't forget about you, no, no, no, you know I never would
Never ever would and I never could
And don't think that I can.. I know you understand
Yeah, uh (Rozay!)
