[Intro: Rick Ross]
Maybach music
It's deeper than the verse, baby
It's deeper than the rap

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]
Doin' a 150 miles and runnin'
Get up in my way, then you know that I'm gunnin'
Laugh about the dough but really ain't nothin' funny
Gettin' rich in a rush, yeah you know us
We're the usual suspects, the real definition of success
Blowin' money cause I can and I love it
From nothin' to somethin'
You know us, we're the usual suspects
You know the boys on the block tryna take us in
Cause we bringin' all of that paper in
From nothin' to somethin'
You know us, we're the usual suspects

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
17, time to man up
Feed the fam boy, I put that on these canned goods
All I got was Diabetes and a damn Ugg
People talkin' down, callin' me a damn scrub
Young niggas, all you want to do is roam free
On your own feet, got to cook your own beef
I'm too cool for lame dudes to ridicule
I laugh while I'm doin' laps in the swimming pool
I don't owe you niggas nothin'
Throw me two fingers when you see a nigga stuntin'
Black Philip Drummond, limousines are the Hummer
Penthouse suite, pretty beach, I call her Summer
Lot of homies passed, see them in the future
Runnin' so fast, on the gas, never neutral
Got to keep a shooter while I'm ridin' in the 7
Higher than a kite by the time I get to heaven

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]
Doin' a 150 miles and runnin'
Get up in my way, then you know that I'm gunnin'
Laugh about the dough but really ain't nothin' funny
Gettin' rich in a rush, yeah you know us
We're the usual suspects, the real definition of success
Blowin' money cause I can and I love it
From nothin' to somethin'
You know us, we're the usual suspects
You know the boys on the block tryna take us in
Cause we bringin' all of that paper in
From nothin' to somethin'
You know us, we're the usual suspects

[Verse 2: Nas]
And still my talent is yet to be challenged
Had no jet with my own pilot
No blastin' off with Flex or DJ Khaled, my mom stressin' college
But my crude sense of logic did allude to my empty wallet
Try spittin' on a green tinted Accord
Which could mean a sentence up North, where the homie was
But back then dough was like a whore that Goldie love, it didn't exist
And Officer Foldy Cuffs was after my wrists
Was not Beverly Hills where we chilled
Imagine this, the Nazareth had to get from rags to rich
I used to stand on rooftops with two Glocks
Figurin', how do I turn my Timberlands to Crocs?
Now reptiles was left out, I'm 'bout a watch, what is you thinkin'?
Murk you, plus the muscle that you bringin' is nothing to me
If you thuggin' or fake and shanked on Cuban, shout out my Ricans
Dealt with all of you gangstas, to the roughest Jamiacans and Haitians

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]
Doin' a 150 miles and runnin'
Get up in my way, then you know that I'm gunnin'
Laugh about the dough but really ain't nothin' funny
Gettin' rich in a rush, yeah you know us
We're the usual suspects, the real definition of success
Blowin' money cause I can and I love it
From nothin' to somethin'
You know us, we're the usual suspects
You know the boys on the block tryna take us in
Cause we bringin' all of that paper in
From nothin' to somethin'
You know us, we're the usual suspects

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
If you follow physics, nigga, money never float
Meanin' every day I'm livin' try to stay afloat
Comin' from a boss, I can predict a double cross
Handlers managin' money they'll never come across
Aspen to Africa, magnanimous numbers involved
AK47s singin' winter, by summer you fall
I dealt with broads and those willin' to sell they soul
Over cars and clothes, man I'm talkin' petty hoes
As my fetti grow, fuck her, feed her Spaghetti-Os
I'm club hoppin' in Cali, shout out to Harry-O
Somebody dim the lights, triple black tux
Keyser SÃ¶ze in the flesh, it's time to catch up
I run with niggas who destined to get a life sentence
Get they baby mama a Lexus for them nice visits
My nigga got a dub and love to do the push ups
I got a million cash, tryna get the kush up

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]
Doin' a 150 miles and runnin'
Get up in my way, then you know that I'm gunnin'
Laugh about the dough but really ain't nothin' funny
Gettin' rich in a rush, yeah you know us
We're the usual suspects, the real definition of success
Blowin' money cause I can and I love it
From nothin' to somethin'
You know us, we're the usual suspects
You know the boys on the block tryna take us in
Cause we bringin' all of that paper in
From nothin' to somethin'
You know us, we're the usual suspects
Doin' a 150 miles and runnin'
Get up in my way, then you know that I'm gunnin'
Laugh about the dough but really ain't nothin' funny
Gettin' rich in a rush, yeah you know us
We're the usual suspects, the real definition of success
Blowin' money cause I can and I love it
From nothin' to somethin'
You know us, we're the usual suspects
You know the boys on the block tryna take us in
Cause we bringin' all of that paper in
From nothin' to somethin'
You know us, we're the usual suspects
