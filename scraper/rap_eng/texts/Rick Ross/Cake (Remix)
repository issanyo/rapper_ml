[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
No top on the Ferrari, cherry on top
Dopeboy diamonds, matching Reeboks
Painting on the wall cost me 2.8
Basquiat boy, watch you know about cake, boy
Two week tour, bonjour, then I skate
3.5 after-party's getting [?]
02 arena, nigga London felt great
Twenty thousand in attendence while I'm smoking on the sage
Had a house party, white girl's sniffin' paint
Now she on the molly, I'm just countin' all the bank
Still smokin' dank, Lenny Kravitz's estate
Rock my own sneakers boy, cake, cake, cake

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
It's not even my birthday
But he wanna lick the icing off
I know you want it in the worst way
Can't wait to blow my candles out
He want that

[Hook: Rihanna]
Cake cake cake cake cake cake cake
Cake cake cake cake cake cake cake cake
Ooh baby I like it, you're so excited
Don't try to hide it, I'mma make you my bitch

[Hook 2: Rihanna]
Cake cake cake cake cake cake cake
Cake cake cake cake cake cake cake cake
I know you wanna bite this, it's so enticing
Nothing else like this, I'mma make you my bitch

[Hook 3: Rihanna]
And it's not even my birthday
But you wanna to put your name on it
And it's not even my birthday
And he trying to put his name on it

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Girl I wanna fuck you right now
Been a long time, I've been missing your body
Let me-let me turn the lights down
When I-when I go down, it's a private party
It's not even her birthday
But I wanna lick the icing off
Give it to her in the worst way
Can't wait to blow her candles out
I want that

[Hook]

[Break: Chris Brown]
Doggy want the kitty
Give me a heart attack and throw it back, now watch me get it
Ain't new to this, but you the shit, damn girl you pretty
Blowing out your candles, let me make a couple wishes

[Break 2: Rihanna]
Remember how you did it?
Remember how you fit it?
If you still wanna kiss it
Come and get it
Sweeter than a rice cake, Cakebread sippin'
Kill it, tip it, cake, fill it

[Verse 4: Rihanna]
If you sexy and you know it and you ain't afraid to show it
Put a candle on my motherfucking back baby blow it
Love the way you do when you do it like that
Show up with the stacks, raining racks on my rack
Wrap it up, wrap it up boy while I take this bow off
Talk that talk, yeah I know I'm such a show off
Daddy make a wish, put this cake in your face
And it's not even my birthday
