If you love me, if you like me
You will not want me to fall in love
Love is true,life is love
Love is not war and destruction

She telling me I need to change
But baby I need the change
2 coupes, 2 bricks, life's too short
Cocktail, 2 Glocks and a Newport
I put my money where my mouth is
Number one anywhere the south is
Rich niggas, you can tell by the outfits
High tops, Versace, I’m on that boss shit

Yes rick you said it, we have to change
And I've just been told that I am
In the top 10 (ten) turkey itunes with my best of
All this is love, when people buy your cd so that you can eat
It was for love that I started music in 2006 (two thousand and six)
Little by little, I grew up, and I'm feature on the magazines
Best video clip at akademia music awards 2015 (two thousand and fifteen) in Hollywood
It’s only under license that I was able to sign with a major
Whore, he will come when this contract with a cash advance and royalties?
Rich niggas, at GBT / klym record I became a major artist
YEAH!!!
I'm rare in showcase, but always in records and compilations
The love I have known only in the eyes of those who like my passion
Apart from family or parental love
Even those to whom you want to entrust your heart
Can break it one day
I wonder what does it pay?
So much so that I become allergic to the word uncle
When a small group dreams of seeing you in the street, sleeping in the cold
It's not the love of meeting against me
That's why we must not fall in love
Baby; you ask me for change;
If I grant you, you must not lose (louz) your mind
STAND UP!!!

If you love me, if you like me
You will not want me to fall in love
Love is true,life is love
Love is not war and destruction

Now I want real love
Not the one who leave you when it's wrong
How can I engage with her for better and for worse?
At my wedding, I would say for the best and for the best!
For not having to deal with all his mood swings all the time
I know, perfection does not exist
But in my pockets I have to count banknotes
Because love and rose water do not feed

Official on the one hand; Businessman and artist of the other
I must work; I have to eat;
Look rick is millionaire in dollars

I must go beyond the cfa; and get there in my turn
I will not touch this drug;
Even if some people wrongly accuse me of doing it
The federals wait; and find that there is nothing

A rich nigga like me, and clean it's not suspicious
MBA, University degree; harvard; I know what I'm worth on the CV (resume)

Even if French is the language I am used to speaking;
This money will last, because I really won it
A feat in the usa, here I am back at the bled;
Rick tell me what to do?

Count cash on the tarmac
For you new niggas gotta run the car fax
VIN numbers that don't match
She telling me this money won’t last

What? I say that this money will last
Unless she likes to spend money
It’s for these people that we must not fall in love

If you love me, if you like me
You will not want me to fall in love
Love is true,life is love
Love is not war and destruction
