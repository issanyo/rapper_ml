[Intro: Rick Ross]
Young Renzel, it's the biggest

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Bussin, bussin, bussin, my lil hittas bussin
Caught you leaving Magic City and you know we done it
Black bottle boys, you see what's glowing in my bucket
Maybach Maybachs pullin up and all them niggas rugged
Step off the throne, look in the eyes of Al Capone
My niggas whippin noodles, Cheetos on they prison phones
Quarter kilo get your whole clique pita rolled
Yellow bitch with green eyes always keep my reefer rolled
Fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, double M or fuck em
AT&T, one collect call and I could touch em
Sam Sneak and my niggas seen my sacrifice
Double Rs on my gate, I live a lavish life
I pray I'm tatted even in my afterlife
Cubans on Ferrari, fat boy got an appetite
I care less about you, therefore it's no discussion
Half a band and niggas bussin like they play percussion
Timberland a busta, hit em with a 808
Keep a homie in the clique that's paid to cut your face
If you didn't notice nigga, we like Puff and Ma$e
Bad Boy, if you cross me, that's another case

[Verse 2: Future]
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman
I just seen the jet take off, they up to something
Them boys just not bluffing, them boys just not bluffing
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to something
She was tryna join the team I told her wait
Chicken wings and fries, we don't go on dates
Nobu, Nobu, Nobu, Nobu, Nobu, Nobu
I just throwed a private dinner in LA
Trapping is a hobby, that's the way for me
Money coming fast, we never getting sleep
I just had to buy another safe
Bentley Spurs and Phantom, Jordan fadeaway
