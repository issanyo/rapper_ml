[Intro: Future & DJ Khaled]
Hide the money and ran outta room, yeah
I tried to hide the money and ran outta room
I tried to hide the money and ran outta room
I tried to hide the money and ran outta room
DJ Khaled!

[Chorus: Future]
Money on your head, you might get hit up today
You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke
In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone
My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater
I, got my hand flooded, I, bought the whole projects
I, got my hood stuntin', this whatever
I, charged the whole 30, I, got my niggas workin'
I, got my bitches down for whatever
(I tried to hide the money and ran outta room) Whatever!
(I tried to hide the money and ran outta room) Whatever!

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
(Geek!)
Pay up like I've been runnin' it up forever
I ran that shit up through the roof
Young nigga ran that shit up for his mother
Buy her everything and I got proof
Up, designer fit, ain't known to buy it
And I done whipped every tire
With the brake pad, "Mello Yello", catch up
Ring me up like your pop-pop, whatever you need to
I skeet then skeet off in a new coupe, keep up!
That V-12 'bout to heat up, grab your seatbelt, your seatbelt
The color of my boxers, yeah I'm Tommy'd up
Got the Tommy tucked, ayy
I toss that shit up like a spray, watch it spill on the clothes
I soak that shit up when they told me "Don't matter, boss won"
I suspended these bitches and I subpoenaed these niggas
To see who was real
I supported my bank account and I wouldn't tell you the account

[Chorus: Future]
Money on your head, you might get hit up today
You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke
In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone
My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater
I, got my hand flooded, I, bought the whole projects
I, got my hood stuntin', this whatever
I, charged the whole 30, I, got my niggas workin'
I, got my bitches down for whatever
(I tried to hide the money and ran outta room) Whatever!
(I tried to hide the money and ran outta room) Whatever!

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Maybach Music
DIamonds all on my fingers, misses still miscellaneous
Left the ski-mask in the 'Rari, residencies out in Vegas
Smoking like Calvin Broadus, blueberry with the big homie
Idols becoming rivals, down to die for my survival
Fell in love with the money, she at the spot every Sunday
Loyalty's what I lust, how I measure my woman
Minimize my mistakes, love every tat on my face
DJ Khaled my blood, got several M's in my safe

[Chorus: Future]
Money on your head, you might get hit up today
You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke
In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone
My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater
I, got my hand flooded, I, bought the whole projects
I, got my hood stuntin', this whatever
I, charged the whole 30, I, got my niggas workin'
I, got my bitches down for whatever
(I tried to hide the money and ran outta room) Whatever!
(I tried to hide the money and ran outta room) Whatever!

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz
Watch me break down bales, residue on scales
Yeah, I had the girls sick, man I cure like nails
Competition might fail, repetition might sell
Dirty kitchen, dirty dishes, dirty bitches, oh well
Foreign whip rider, lobster on my rider, uh
You can get the platter, uh, I put my money up
You gon' need a ladder, work, no acrobatics
Work, no calisthenics, my dick be acting stingy
My check be acting boujee, my car got all the groupies
I bought a new Rolex now my old Rolex tryna sue me
Fashion on exotic, pistol on regardless
Bitches look like Barbie, Ricky Bobby on my trolly

[Bridge: Future]
Tryna set a bando on fire
I'm just tryna get you so higher
Money coming in, we get flyer
You must be tryna wife her like Tiger

[Chorus: Future]
Money on your head, you might get hit up today
You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke
In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone
My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater
I, got my hand flooded, I, bought the whole projects
I, got my hood stuntin', this whatever
I, charged the whole 30, I, got my niggas workin'
I, got my bitches down for whatever
(I tried to hide the money and ran outta room) Whatever!
(I tried to hide the money and ran outta room) Whatever!
