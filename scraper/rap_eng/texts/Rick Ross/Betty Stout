[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Indictment'll take a life line or take your lifetime
For them legal fees, your money better be like mine
The feds offer 20, he was still in denial
Went to trial lost it, tried to cry but couldn't make a sound
Choking off the facts, eyes full of tears
Momma's only son just got himself 50 years
And the game don't stop, baby mama still fucked
Your discoveries filled with names you wouldv've killed for
Nah you can't cry, you're through your old flicks
Brother on your daddy's side now fucking your main bitch
Appeal been denied, no fulfillment in life
It's the life of the party popping pills in the night
Now it's 5 by 7, knives and weapons, lies and deception
Lose your life in a second

[Hook: Birdman]
See the game, what's the price
High rolling was the dice
Money like a motherfucker, shot 'em all night
Situation bad, pistol on his ass
Come up hard, we had to mash on the gas
Muscle was the come up, game was the struggle
Came from nothing, made something into bubble
Did it real big just for the hustle
Got a lot of it on another level

[Verse 2: Birdman]
The precious jewels, what's the price, the lovely life
We did it right and got rich up under hot lights
All through the hustle, knew about the times
So we did it a little time, got back up on the grind
New about the soldiers, raised from the soldiers
Gave 'em all the game, how to be a high roller
Dump the fucking people with this presidential sight
Got a bitch that night, put her on the same flight
The same type of nigga that would put it in her life
Talk from a OG that had five stripes
You is just a fiend just like a dope fiend, shoot up in your veins
Lick it clean with a triple beam
Higher than life, green on a candy slab
Taking showers, jumping out the duffle bags

[Hook: Birdman]
See the game, what's the price
High rolling was the dice
Money like a motherfucker, shot 'em all night
Situation bad, pistol on his ass
Come up hard, we had to mash on the gas
Muscle was the come up, game was the struggle
Came from nothing, made something into bubble
Did it real big just for the hustle
Got a lot of it on another level

[DJ Khaled]
We the biggest hustlers in the game
