Stop playing I can see that you are hating
I got it all I donno what am chasing
Black shades yeah you know what you facing
Am at the finish line don't bother racing

Mtl the only city am missing
Born hard look at the rhymes that am placing
I ain't rapping for you I ain't rapping for fame
Throwing a couple of rhymes, show respect to my name

Rest in peace or rest in peaces
Pray to god and knee to me
Am so on my level I swear I Envy me
2012 nigga that's a word from a G

Look at me bowling throwing shit to you face
High definition a life in a million of frames
Hundred words for the seek of a claim
Am cold blooded but am hot as flame
Huge Balls u can tell by the name (HB)
Style and fragrance - One and the same
Call of pussy nigga checkout the game

I could talk about the swag
I could talk about the flow
I could talk about the girls
Screaming gime gime more

High definition my life in full HD
Nigga stop hating am screaming c'est la vie

Huge belt checkout my initials
Shiny watches fat chains and new officials
Still smoking Cubans and rappers
Still chasing after bitches and paper
