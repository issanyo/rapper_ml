[Hook: Nawlage]
I’m sick and tired of you bugging me while I’m (doing my best)
But you come riding me ? 'cause I'm (doing my best)
Let me, let me, let me do me
Let me, let me, let me do me

[Verse 1: Nawlage]
Don’t you know that you’re the reason why I hate having this cellphone?
You keep calling me, you keep calling me
Modern technology, calling me
You constantly bothering me
Think that you gotta let your problems, girl
You ? that you’re calling me
I don’t play games, with you all day
???

[Bridge: Nawlage]
Just let you know what I’m doing
Asking me questions like, who I'm doing
? to keep it moving

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
She keep calling me, she knows I’m still balling
Car costs half a million, fuck them, I still bought them
Had to ? the top, make sure you see my face
She call me Ricky Ross, oh yeah I beat that case
Birds still chirping, I’m talking all day
? we do this all day!
Six figures niggas, spend that on my court case
?

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Girl, we need to slow it down
I’m at the studio, I’m being true to you
But you're being insecure
Calling me every time you’re bored
You’re hard to ignore, you’re being insecure
So find a cure
? trade it with a ?
You don’t have to blow up the phone
? girl

[Bridge]
