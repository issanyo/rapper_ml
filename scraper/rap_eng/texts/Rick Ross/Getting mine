[[Chorus]
The summer's mine
The summer's mine
I'm buying ten bottles bitch
And I'm on number nine
The summer's mine
The summer's mine
Everytime she see a new whip
She know it's one of mine

[verse 1]
The summer's mine
New silver scaglietti
Fuck a ron don you niggas ain't ready
You nigg-s is petty
You nigg-s spaghetti
Bustin' yo meatball
Nigga you better be ready
You niggas pathetic
Leave you paraphlegic
You throwin' up sets
But you really from Cleveland
Uh
Fuck boy (4x) uh
See I broke it down like a quarter key
Bitch I run the show
I'm what you wanna be
This how you wanna live
This what you wanna drive
Be honest with yourself
I'm who you idolize

[Chorus]
The summer's mine
The summer's mine
I'm buying ten bottles bitch
And I'm on number nine
The summer's mine
The summer's mine
Everytime she see a new whip
She know it's one of mine
The summer's mine
The summer's mine
Everytime you look around
They spinnin' one of mine
The summer's mine
The summer's mine
The last motherf-cker that you want to undermind

[Verse 2]
This muth-f-ckas mad that I'm icey
Talking to a pussy nigga yeah I might be
Uh
Let it resonate first forty eight
Home of the chppa toatas my paper straight
I assasinate and employ 'em all
Sh-ttin' on ya dogs I'm just showin' off (rozay)
Self made, you just affiliated
Really a waterboy nigga you entertainment
Blowin' money fast, yellow maserati
Deadman walking, decomposing body
Uh
I'm livin' large, this nigga been a mark
They used his credit cards
Just to get they rental cars

[Chorus]
The summer's mine
The summer's mine
I'm buying ten bottles bitch
And I'm on number nine
The summer's mine
The summer's mine
Everytime she see a new whip
She know it's one of mine
The summer's mine
The summer's mine
Everytime you look around
They spinnin' one of mine
The summer's mine
The summer's mine
The last motherf-cker that you want to under mind
