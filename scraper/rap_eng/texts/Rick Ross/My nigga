Black bottle boys, Ciroc lifestyle, Mastermind
Untouchable Empire ya heard me

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Four stacks on the balmain jean jacket
I'm addicted to things i got a mean habit
Nigga look at my rings i've got team tatted
Me stacking my cream the only thing matter
Me whippin that 'cain you know it's G status
Quarter Key in back just like a beef potted
When am in the spot know it's straight crackin'
Got your chain snached actin' like it ain't happen
Jigga am with won at least eight pageants
Cartier cost ya boy 80 carats
Black bottle boy we can go to war
Started 40 bottles, we can order more
Outgrewed save; Money waterwall
My Audemars for ballers, nigga none of y'all
Shit got real back in '98
Look around lil niggas buying weight
Park the money caller when it's seven ???
All white phantom now we heavy weight
Talkin money team, money nigga everyway
Money team, money nigga everyway
She never fucked a nigga with straight commas
They come right back like I'm A. Broner
Come right back like I'm A. Broner
Come right back like I'm A. Broner

[Verse 2: Young Breed]
Got some niggas who will slide like them killers in the eighties
All i got to do is say it ain't no finna maybe
I bust a nigga head it just how my momma raised me
Never really knew my daddy so my brother had to get me
Uptown native, all black mercedes
And my motherfuckin' wrist worth four and a baby
Used to break them down daily, like fuck you; pay me
Now you lookin' at the plug it's self made paper
Pussy on demand like I'm paying for a cable
Told that bitch this a mob ain't no motherfuckin' label
Tryin' put a hundred grand in the middle of my palm
I do it for my niggas who can't even get a pawn
Big dope dealer with a death sentence
Ain't snitch, kept it real that's real nigga
Side bitches still trippin' tryin' kill you winner
Got 99 problems, pussy ain't issue
And I'm strapped; what's a pussy nigga would tryin' play
I'm from the jungle nothin but killers and wolves where I stay
Still a type that tell that i'm cool with a 'cain
Bitch I'm good in the hood and I'm good at the bank
