[Hook]
See if I wanna ride (x2), on the shine (x2), I'ma get that bread
See I'll be on my grind all the time in the streets to survive gonna shake them feds


[Verse 1:Rick Ross]
I was moving major work when I vibed on the street
Razor blades on the jag raise a blade in the cheek shit sweet
I quit sleeping in the streets it's all complete now
Big house, new car, nice watch made man, airplane
Got a hand in every pot
We pan every cock, ? can every shot it all comes to meet now
The judgment don't wanna fuck with get your touch bitch
I'm focused, flyin' ? snortin' on foes, seeking beef
Smoking murder on the Don, you don't wanna see me
I pull the seemie in 3D the first 3B freebies, wanna ??
Carol city raised,Carol city raised, ? on the booby boys Carol city days
The game on you, can you stand on your own two?
Hundred and thirty murders, my dawg comin' home too

[Hook]

[Verse 2:Cinque]
I shake the feds like a dice game
Raised by the OGs shoot a precise aim
Besides game ice all on my bright lane
Keep the heart top, cuz you never know my mind frame
Yeah, keep my eyes on the forecast
? rise too high and that's your ass
That's your bad nigga I ain't new to this
Take your head off tryin' to play me all sorts of stupid shit
Ask Ludacris? I'm finally gettin' stupid rich
And with a kryptonite chain on we the super ?
I got a gangster team
That'll aim any stupid nigga scheme to separate me from queen
Man let's squad the ultimate regime, ?? got a ?
And I sink you can call me ?
126s yell sippin' ??

[Hook]

[Verse 3:Big Duke]
Now niggas know me, I'd be on a motherfucking block
Beat a bitch on the plot with a Glock and a wife beater
Post about white reeger for you high-head can't believe my pistol got a heatseeker
So if you think about a plot you'd better think deeper
Or you'll end up old news like my first beeper
You ain't even got a ? I'm a reaper
Night creeper, ??? white people
Niggas don't ? play no games
I can stress this enough I don't fuck with lames
? hollerin' about he insane
Watch how sane he gonna' get, watch how I snatch his ?
I put pussies in their place
In their place they settle their bet not up in my face
A lot of niggas fake, but not in my case
Niggas can't floss, not in my space
