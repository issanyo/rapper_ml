Let me tell you how meny money there can bye
First class flight to the moon
Jewish Mafia nigga
Maybach music
October 13, Meek Milly, dreams and nightmares
I think you all know exactly what the fuck that is
Ha, ha, ha

God forgives the I don´t on the road of platinum
Yeah, Warner brothers, Dej Jam records
The power circle, Maybach music!
Shout out to the entire conglomerate, nigga
Black Bar Mitzvah- all you niggas invited
-You were invested like Jews, nigga


I’ll be at these wars, I still be living by rules
So when I run in the dudes
You know we’re stumping in the mood
Pop and lock go to popping niggas say when they’re flopping
Let me get back to my bitches Cause you bitch niggas ain’t nothing
Miami boys and this bitch
I brought out all the zoes with me
Still buy pussy from strippers and send them kilos to Philly
Nigga real as it gets, look at the wheels on my whip
You want to go to the moon, I'm screaming re-load the clip
I bought my bitch from Perfections, you know I buy my affection
Ain't no love for me, nigga, and I accept my direction
On my road to perfection, so many hours invested
So many niggas we handle
You know the other profession
I’ll go to the moon
I’ll go to the moon
I’ll go to the moon
I´ll go like baloon
