[Intro: G-Eazy]
You know if I say something I mean it
These things happen
Yeah

[Hook: Remo]
If I ever said I'm never scared
Just know I mean it
If I ever said I fucked your bitch
Just know I mean it
And if I ever said I'm gettin' money
Just know I mean it
And oh Lord oh Lord knows
He knows I mean it
Yeah, you know I mean it
You know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Signed Gerald, I'm sincere
This year I'm in here, I'll spell it out to make things clear
Meanwhile your end's near, I've got a lane and I'm in gear
You people wonder who's next up
That conversation really ends here
You rappers just talk a bunch, stress me out, I chop a dutch
Weak rappers tryna bite the sound, but my style is a lot to munch
And I'm more like whiskey neat, and you're more like vodka punch
"Gâ€™s dope, he might blow up," think I know, I've got a hunch
On my side it's authentic, you try to stunt but it's all rented
But you're dope you got a bad chick, yeah, cool bro we all get it
She wears a ring, came through without it
You really think she stay true? I doubt it
Cause I'm fucking your girlfriend, and there's nothing you can do about it

[Hook: Remo]
If I ever said I'm never scared
Just know I mean it
If I ever said I fucked your bitch
Just know I mean it
And if I ever said I'm gettin' money
Just know I mean it
And oh Lord oh Lord knows
He knows I mean it
Yeah, you know I mean it
You know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
All my bitches loyal freaks
All my niggas rich I'm talking oil sheiks
All these different jets we like to land now
Word up in Atlanta here come the man now
Hate to see you gossiping cause that's for the bitches
We took over the projects while you did the dishes
See me at the Superbowl still with the killas
Balling out in Vegas so she in the Villas
I'm at the poker table like I'm Donald Trump
Her spanish friend with her tryin' to double up
Black Bottle Boys and I been a boss
Riding out in paris with my ceiling off
I'm just tricking off

[Hook: Remo]
If I ever said I'm never scared
Just know I mean it
If I ever said I fucked your bitch
Just know I mean it
And if I ever said I'm gettin' money
Just know I mean it
And oh Lord oh Lord knows
He knows I mean it
Yeah, you know I mean it
You know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
