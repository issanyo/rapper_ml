[Hook: Young Dolph]
She push it so good, that I bought that bitch a car
I'm drinking on Activis, so I never call
That bitch is so good, I went in that pussy raw
Everytime I make it, I send pationts ut to god
I'm all about a check, I'm all about a check
Put them racks up on my chain, that's where my strap at
I'm all about a check, I'm all about a check
I walk in the club, and make them bitches turn up for a check

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
I came to the club, with a lot of Gualla on me
All this ice, that's a quarter million dollars on me
If that car don't come off the showroom, then I don't want it
Smashed lil mama, then made her tat my name on it
Welcome to the streets, where it ain't no rules
I just put a hundred thousand in an old school
They say you get rich from sellin dope, then you a criminal
I say you get rich by sellin dope, then you a genius
I'm so lit, I just left Mars, then went to Venus
All my bitches bad, man, you gotta see this
I'm trappin all week, and flexin all weekend
I put your bitch on a ho, cause my new bitch is biefen
I call the plug and say I need a whole hundred
He sent them to me asap, I call him Rondo
I put her in designer heals, matching skirt
She gonna fuck me, real good, and she gonna hold all the work

She push it so good, that I bought that bitch a car

Put them racks up on my chain, that's where my strap at
I'm all about a check, I'm all about a check
I walk in the club, and make them bitches turn up for a check

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Steppin through the backdoor in the club, can't come in the front
Paper tag on a new porsh every other month
Had that Coofy on my head when we roled the buss
Fat Trell with the Uzi, all I had to say was bust
Had that Buic Regal, then I went and got the Bends
The vudu lady told me, next week, Imma touch a prick
Rich nigga, run my label like I'm J. Prince
Bitch nigga, you just a murder charge, state offence
In my hood, my trap be poppin up, like Starbucks
G-5, I had them bitches lookin starstruck
G Waggan, bitch, I might buy you that small truck
Crack money, I just payed for 5 abortions
Condo all white, I might call that the fortrass
I sspend 60 stacks just for the mortgage
For the main course, I ordered her that blowfish
A line of Cocaine, and a duzzan roses

[Verse 3: Fat Trell]
Hustle everyday, that's only my agenda
The type to take a brick and stuff it in the blender
Stadem, the way I pull up, make them bitches sweat
Rolexes, just know I can't forget t the stone sets
Long sessions in the kitchen till my arm hurt
Hundred akers, got them bitches doing lawn work
Hundred shy bitches, I pull up, Imma bomb first
Then go shopping, get my bitch a Luie Vuitton perse
40 thousand just to travel in this real life
Activis, you know my ice is real light
Take a flight and end up with stock, call that simple math
Stop in Memphis, talk to Dolph, make that to a gram
Had a meeting with the cracker, made my mama proud
That only made her hit the dealer, 7 figure crown
Og is one who's standing on his own feat
Cause you the one to put his sick feat
