[Hook]
Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me

Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me

Nigga gon respect me, Nigga best respect me

Nigga gon respect me, Nigga best respect me
'Cause ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Ain’t another nigga like me
I know these hoes don’t like me
RPTs for your whole family
'Cause your best friend tried to trap me
The world game is so slimy
But all my niggas are grimy
I cut real strutted violin
Beefin over, so icy
Blood all over my Nikes
Man, I’m fucking your wifey
Gucci Mane, I’m not Hify
So don’t jump around me
King of the streets, gon' crown me
Like Cliff Loutter woulda doubt me
Got a white girl like Ice T
Figure white bricks in the SUV
Drug dealers will consign me
Brick Squad, yea we violent
Catch catchers turn silent
Twitter bad bitches are the problem, ported
Came by the jail and I started back ballin'
Phone gotta charge 'cause the hoes keep callin'
Read about you’s, cutting beef and broccoli
And I’m the first nigga to say trapaholic

[Hook]
Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
Ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me
Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
Ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me

Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
Ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me
Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
'Cause ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Facing double life, my nigga went to trial
Think he getting out, my nigga in denial
Gave his bitch the Benz just to get around
Quarter milli on his lawyer, money bagging down
Top off of dome, squares off of my trone
Fuck talking on phones already know what my dog want
I push a button and them killers coming
Disrespect me? Niggas get nothing
Seeing 50 keys, started from a crumb
Mad brag, G wagging, riding through the slums
I could take a penny, flip it to a dollar
You will never disrespect me on my red Impala

[Hook]
Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
Ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me
Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
Ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me

Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
Ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me
Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
'Cause ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me
