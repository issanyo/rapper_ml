[Intro]
Kansas City, Miami Florida, Minnesota, Chinatown, Baltimore, DC and west side in Bay Area

[Verse 1]
And here for the love with the gold game
On the black market, the way you get the cold cash
Pretty bitches, expensive cars, could relax black cars, transactions in Swiss banks
Doubler, self made, black dollar, number 4, Bill Gates
Black power, young Skrill, Broward County we up next
Top shooter Chris call up my projects
Black jet with my homie Rickie Ronzel
Black bottles, as we popping for my new deal
Only nigga that could move it, that try miss
Wanna ride, black market, get the black ticket
Turn your night gand, wanna let me in
Tap a nigga, I would never side with Fifty Cent
Doubler my niggas Sneak know Imma rise
Michael phelps with the chopper niiga take a dive

[Verse 2]
I pray to God that he'll protect me from my villain
See I could squoosh, she can never be a friend of me
Take the position, no competition, I'm really willing
To check precision, am never slipping, am never missing
Am feeling business, I see no evil with 20 vision
Them bitches hating, they only like you when benefiting
In God we trust, that's the quote that am known for stating
I thank the Lord for all the real bitches in the making
The see my come up, now them bitches want to chat about me
I use to tell 'em bout my dream, they sat and laugh about it
Won't let it phase me, I won't let them bring the savage out me
The young is doing it, I bet you nigga ask about me
She so observed how bitches they tell you get the urge
Won't hurt my nerves, smoke this burners, I speak my words
They made it legal, they kill these bitches, so this my purge
Oh suicide, let you decide while I smoke my herb

[Verse 3]
Am from the bone, thug you niggas
Busy Bone, Ricky Bone (Made back music) aahh
Marble floors, Gucci slippers in the palace
Ran through the "H" couple bitches out in Dallas
I was Partying out in Vegas, got me still feeling dazed
Looking two big booty, busy straight outta di bail
I was running when
Till I caught her with a man, and I
Know no name
Never ask me when
Where's your friend when you need 'em
He was also with a girl
This is
Fuck a million and before he 18
Like a
I won't hit you with it
Like a
And I did it for the boys
Every day and am high and a noon, me a nine
I know I nigga name Regga, what them motherfuckers buy
Follow me on Twitter

[Outro]
True, Boss
Black market nigga
