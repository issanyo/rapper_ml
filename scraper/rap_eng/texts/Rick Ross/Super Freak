[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
And I got two bitches on me freaky
You can't bring her home to mama, she too freaky
And I got two bitches and they're freaky
You can't bring her home to mama, she too freaky
Super, super, super, super, freaky
Super, super, super, super, freaky

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
She just topped me down that shit was deep
Now she tryna call another freak
Hit that jam squad Sam Sneak
That's your ho? Well she with me oh
Know you see these bands, what you gon' do for me?
I say fuck your man, what you gon' do for me?
Aces in New York, it got the super freaks
I can't go in there I already knew them freaks
Won't tell nobody what you do for me
I ain't paying shawty, this what you gon' do for free
What you do for free
Four bitches, two for you and I got two for me
Shawty is you super freaky
Cause tonight I need a three way

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
And I got two bitches on me freaky
You can't bring her home to mama, she too freaky
And I got two bitches and they're freaky
You can't bring her home to mama, she too freaky
Super, super, super, super, freaky
Super, super, super, super, freaky
Know you see these bands, what you gon' do for me?
I say fuck your man, what you gon' do for me?

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Couple million in cash it got me on some different shit
Walk in the booty club just for the shrimp and grits
Bitches staring at us like we super stars
The gangstas on the wall they all salute the gods
Lamborghini doors and rose gold Audemars
Middle of the dance floor and she snorting raw
All my accountants are held accountable
Had my suite for eight months tucked in the Fountaine Bleue
Just got my green bitch a green Chanel bag
Over 60 G's and never seen a sales tag
I pull a yacht out in the summer time
Can brag about the houses in another rhyme, boss

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
And I got two bitches on me freaky
You can't bring her home to mama, she too freaky
And I got two bitches and they're freaky
You can't bring her home to mama, she too freaky
Super, super, super, super, freaky
Super, super, super, super, freaky
Know you see these bands, what you gon' do for me?
I say fuck your man, what you gon' do for me?

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
Got the head three times cause she's super freaky
Had to hit the V Live for the super freaks
Head to G5 for the super freak
PT's out in Hialeah super freaking
Studio 23, I'm out with Vito
Then i hit up Golden Boy, he got the freak hoes
Fuck a bougie bitch, I need a super freak
Down to eat McDonalds, we don't do Phillipes
Fuck me the first night, you super freaking
Magnums on me, I'm not going out like Eazy
Bird call only for the freaks
Bird call only for the freaks

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
And I got two bitches on me freaky
You can't bring her home to mama, she too freaky
And I got two bitches and they're freaky
You can't bring her home to mama, she too freaky
Super, super, super, super, freaky
Super, super, super, super, freaky
Know you see these bands, what you gon' do for me?
I say fuck your man, what you gon' do for me?
