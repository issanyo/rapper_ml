[Hook: August Alsina]
Started off in the streets
We would take collection from the fiends
People dying all around me
So I gave you my testimony
We were down from the beginning
When the world wasn't listening
Now that I got your attention
Let us end with the benediction

[Verse 1: August Alsina]
We are gathered here today
Paying our respects to being broke, hope he's in a better place
'Cause life out here ain't sweet, oh no
I would close my eyes to sleep, but didn't dream no more
So I had to make a way for my home, you know
Now I'm in a place where I ain't gotta scheme no more
The good life, I'm done with the hood life
I did what I could, didn't always do what I should and I was misunderstood
So many nights I tried
To hide how I felt, I would cry inside
And I ran through the streets 'til my feet got tired
'Cause I ain't wanna have my shoes on them power lines

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
But I made it, and it made me
I know I did wrong, I pray to God he forgave me
'Cause I made it, it didn't kill me
So it made me stronger, I pray to God that you feel me, that you feel me

[Hook: August Alsina]

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
Our father, who art in heaven
I pray you free me from my demons and keep me level
I know you kept me out of prison, where I was heading
When I heard somebody killed my brother, one-eighty-seven
I hope he made it to your presence, for me he was a blessing
At least I know he's rested and he ain't out here stressing
Tryna get to the good life and out of this hood life
I pray that my step-pops lay off that crack pipe
So mama could sleep nights, I know it's been hard on her
I was ripping through the streets, it was hard for her
Now I'm up in hotels on the ocean shore
When I was sleeping on the floor at the corner store

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
But I made it, and it made me
I know I did wrong, I pray to God he would save me
'Cause I made it, it didn't kill me
So it made me stronger, I pray to God that you feel me, you could feel me

[Hook: August Alsina]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Bottle after bottle, snatchin' Belaire out the bucket
Rightin' all my wrongs for these homies out here thuggin'
Pray for benediction, pretty women on my premise
Condo out in Cabo, screamin' "GABOS" to my nemesis
Gold around my neck, I'm ballin' for these final minutes
Nothin' lasts forever, for these sins I seek repentance
Shots fired, another gone, I feel that man's pain
Daddy sat me down and said, "That came with the game"
Shake my head, roll up the window, turnin' up the music
So much anger in these songs for these soldiers that we losin'
A mastermind is one who's feedin' others off his talent
I owe it to my city but it's time I pay my balance
I'm in Holyfield's estate, I started with a pallet
I made my first tape, I gave that shit to Khaled
Thankful for my supporters, everyone that ever bought us
Grateful for every lesson these Miami streets taught us
