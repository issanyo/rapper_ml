[Intro]
Regardless of how it goes down, life goes on, am I right?
Am I right? Am I right?
Just the way I've conditioned my mindset
For me to stand up position well, I can survive

[Verse 1]
Living a life of crime is nothing you should glamorize
When seeing your mother smile you had to fantasize
But now it's jellyfish in all the fish tanks
So rich, think what's on a nigga wrist fake
Ain't Jewish, thank jewelers for Frank Muellers
Tenth grade,  Mac 11s, they ain't schoolers
Taught us to think foolish, degrade women
Call all the bitches hoes, still amazed with them
Corner educated, codeine medicated
Every night we celebrated cause we elevated
I am Michael Tyson, Robin Givens in the wind
She knocking at the door, don't let that devil in
Ordered her room service, caviar and cannabis
She ordered the nose candy with the candles lit
Am laid back, status of a Corleone
Screaming Maybach with my Yellow Rollie on

[Chorus]
All my watches designer, all my women designer
Simple gifts from the Gods, I pray you all pray for survival
Smiling in your face, Mac 11 on his waist
Make or break your day better, say your amazing grace
Now you beefing with motherfuckers you never heard of
It's just another hurdle, they wanna see you murdered
Or back to flippin' burgers, better bust your burners
Say my amazing grace, before they reach they a verdict

[Verse 2]
Hey hells kitchen burning me a bell pepper
Minus the lady, P.I. 80 cuz it smells better
Say my amazing grace, she says it's just a phase
Unless it's sustained, am not in this for fame
Minus the hoe shit, the most 'emo-shit'
Versace, Neils, 60 mils selling blow shit
Coudn't make a layer, labelled a brick layer
Pull up at the park in the six, player
Six speed all the fares they can follow
Am at the Delano, ï»¿where my model mulatto
Turn the strip club into an arcade
For a coin you could play dem broads, broad day
Get them junkies blowing before I master Donkey Kong
Shit was funny till I started bringing money home
Still think it's a game, aim at your high score
Call it a rap beef, bitch I'm down to die for it

[Chorus] [x2]

[Outro]
All my watches designer
All my women designer
They wanna see you murdered
Better bust your burner
That's all I know, got a feeling
100 million up, that's the realest
(Maybach Music)
