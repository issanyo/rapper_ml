[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
From my nigga Diddy view, I think I see his vision too
Purple Rain over Central Park, chillin' with my goons
Big Pop's & Sade's, Cirocs & Chardonnay's
My Cassie's sassy so my penthouse my balloon
We doin' it big, it's goin' down, 9/11
I'm doin' it big, pullin' up in a 911
I been tryna fuck for months, baby girl it's now or never
Got the condo on the beach, hope through our storms we shall weather
Uhh, we shinin' when it's pitch dark
Yeah this bitch a movie, but this time I play a big part
Uhh, fuck the marketin', look at what I'm accomplishin'
I'm beatin' niggas by margins bigger than Fran Tarkenton

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
All these cars, all these stars, all around me (super high)
Put your eyes to the sky, that's where you'll find me
Cause we are, we are, super high
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I wanna buy my bitch every bag
And she ain't ever, ever, ever gotta take em back
I wanna take my bitch around the globe
Hawaii, hang glidin' in the mountains, shittin' on these hoes
Red bottoms by the barrel
Pop the Giuseppe tags like it's American Apparel
$20,000 up in Barneys, haters'll never harm me
Rick Owens on me, bombers for my whole army
Andele, andele, baby move fast (yea)
She drop it down and bring it back, I like that
I wanna buy my bitch every bag
So she ain't ever, ever, ever gotta take 'em back

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
All these cars, all these stars, all around me
Put your eyes to the sky, that's where you'll find me
Cause we are, we are, super high
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

[Bridge: Rick Ross]
If you lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss, take a look
I'm super fly, I'm super high
You gettin' yours? I'm gettin' mine

[Verse 3: Ne-Yo]
Ooh, women of a caliber
Only seen in magazines and calendars
And I'm sittin' with Miss October
Cause my birthday's in October
Strawberry and her Ros√© on
I can see it in her eye, cause she wink and she toast me
And later on we gonna mosey
To a place less populated and get cozy

[Hook: Rick Ross & Ne-Yo]
If you lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss, take a look
Put your eyes to the sky, that's where you'll find me
(Super high) Rosay, Rosay, Rosay
Cause we are, we are, super high
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

[Bridge: Rick Ross]
If you lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss, take a look
I'm super fly, I'm super high
You gettin' yours? I'm gettin' mine

[Outro: N.W.A, Ne-Yo & Rick Ross]
What the fuck are they yellin'
What the fuck are they yellin' (super high)
What the fuck are they yellin'
What the fuck are they yellin' (Rosay)
What the fuck are they yellin' (Rosay)
What the fuck are they yellin' (Rosay)
What the fuck are they yellin'
What the fuck are they yellin' (super high)
