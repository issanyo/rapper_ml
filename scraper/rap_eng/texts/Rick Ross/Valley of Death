[Hook: LaTonya Givens & Rick Ross]
If I could leave this place
With a smile on my face
I'd give up everything
Just to make you happy
But we both know, oh, oh, oh
This ain't how live goes
We could build our own world
But the streets keep callin' me

The meek shall inherit the earth
That's what The Bible says
I need it

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Walk like a giant, talk like a tyrant
Faith of a mustard seed, destined for a triumph
David or Goliath, hate me or admire
Kush burns slow, as I chase my desire
Embrace my empire, Batty Boy, eat fire
Guns like choirs, when they sing, "Keep quiet"
"Will I get to heaven?" Turn to Psalm 27
Lord knows when I see this Monkey, I'mma be The Devil
Beat him cause I'm clever, beat him at whatever
You never was a G, nigga, Unit mean together!
New York unified, Down South love that
When we got to shine, "Motherfuckers, where the love at?"
Real niggas gettin' Money, better log off
Think the game's dead now?
Now imagine when your dog gone
Imagine when it's all gone
When your phone off, there's only one to call on

[Hook: LaTonya Givens & Rick Ross]
If I could leave this place
With a smile on my face
I'd give up everything
Just to make you happy
But we both know, oh, oh, oh
This ain't how live goes
We could build our own world
But the streets keep callin' me

I mean, if I die today
I could honestly say
Thank you, Lord
Thank you, Lord
Thank you, Lord

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm bigger than a title, bigger than a name
You could label we the biggest label in the game
Put food on the table, fed the whole city
Tell me who be the fool if The Feds come get me?
Fetty isn't better, when you're called a trendsetter
When world's so cold, hope you got a little sweater
Caught a little case, but he had a little cheddar
Pled-out to fifteen, poured his life in a letter
Very first line, he called Trick Daddy stupid
Say he got AIDS, tellin' people that it's lupus
Not the one just to jump to conclusions
I'm gettin' money, small talk could be a nuisance
Both chains, reminiscin' to them nooses
Sittin' on deuces, new Land-Cruisers (BOSS!)
Who the fuck you callin' losers?
You niggas losin', look like you could use us

[Hook: LaTonya Givens & Rick Ross]
If I could leave this place
With a smile on my face
I'd give up everything
Just to make you happy
But we both know, oh, oh, oh
This ain't how live goes
We could build our own world
But the streets keep callin' me

When I bought my first Run DMC vinyl
And my first 2 Live Crew cassette
I would've cried if I knew where I'm at today
Took me forty minutes to walk there to buy it

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Call your boy a C.O., but if I really was
When all these niggas undercover fuckin' niggas up?
Keep it Trilla, nigga, never had a gun and badge!
Kept a nice watch, smokin' on a hundred sacks
Back in the day, I sold crack for some nice kicks
Skippin' school I saw my friend stabbed with an icepick
Young nigga, fifteen with three seeds
From that very day, I carried on the three C's
Can't criticize niggas tryna get jobs
Better get smart, young brother, live yours
Only live once and I got two kids
And for me to feed them, I'd get two gigs
I'd shovel shit, I'd C.O
So we can bow our head and pray over the meatloaf
I'm lookin' at the big picture
Keep a bitch wit'cha, tryin' to get a bit richer

[Hook: LaTonya Givens & Rick Ross]
If I could leave this place
With a smile on my face
I'd give up everything
Just to make you happy
But we both know, oh, oh, oh
This ain't how live goes
We could build our own world
But the streets keep callin' me

I remember prayin' for, for me just to get the, the opportunity
To have a record deal
And now I sign artists
Thank you, Lord
