[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
It's funny how the time fly when you doing time
Coming home to all this newfound sunshine
I ain't get a letter from my homies one time
But she was there for me , ain't missed one time
I got plans for her, put a rock on her hand for her
I'mma be there every chance for her
I plan to build a home, with a peeling dome
Two doors, and fuck it, throwing a picture phone
I was raised to eat, you had to get your own
Niggas gon' front, had to get you on
But you was willing to do anything to get your own
Traffic in the cabinet, even get the kitchen going
Other niggas scared, you the one they snitching on
Hope your people fingerprint your scale when they kick it open
I got another plan, brother take your woman and
Take her to the motherland ?

[Hook: Celeb Forever]
It's bad then if we ain't grinding
Haters put the shades on, they see us shining
Audemir engraved with all these diamonds
Look at our arrangements, this sh-ts so timeless
So timeless baby, so timeless
Look up in the sky girl, and you might find us
So timeless baby, so timeless
Uh, so timeless

[Verse 2: Celeb Forever]
Okay, times flies, cars in sync, tell 'em bye- bye
I'm busy, you free most of the time, nigga, wi-fi
King James shit, you a prince, no Cyhi
I never lose sight of the money, I got my eyes wide
Eating good here, y'all some Ramen Noodle bowl
All I wear is Loui shit, classic Roman Numerals
Fuck you, hit 'em with the one two, uno dos
Bitches tell me, "You're fucking outrageous", UFO
Little weed, little white, get your berry on
? flyer than a carry-on, carry on
Charlie's Angels, uh, Drew Barrymore
Always on that gay shit, fuck is niggas staring for?
Time for you to trim this, I never fuck a hairy wh-re
Balling like a gymnast, slamming like a heavy door
Haters don't need Best Cuts, that's what we got machetes for!
Hundreds in my other hand, I need another rubber band

[Bridge: Rick Ross]
It's funny how the time fly
It's funny how the time fly
It's funny how the time fly
IT's funny how the time fly

[Bridge: Celeb Forever]
Yeah, it's funny how the time fly
Yeah, it's funny how the time fly
True grinders always know what the time is
Thirty different watches but baby this sh-ts timeless
