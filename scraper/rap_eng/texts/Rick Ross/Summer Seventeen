[Intro: Rick Ross]
(Maybach Music)
You scared to die, nigga?
Open your eyes wide and I pray you are (huh)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm out on bond so I gotta beat it (huh)
All the dope boys say they wanna be me (boss)
I got a lick, boy, I got a lick (I got a lick)
2017 trust me, boy, this one is it
I used to smoke the weed until my fingers burn (huh)
Pool of bitches fuckin' me, I got 'em takin' turns (woo)
My nigga bought the stick but you wanna fade (fick)
Made runnin' in the bank a residential thing (huh)
All my niggas mad they like, "Fuck the world" (fuck it)
Back to standin’ on the Ave. with a couple birds
If you a killer, well I’m tryna see (huh)
'Cause callin' the police the only thing free (woo)
I had to park that purple Lamborghini​ (yummm)
And pull that Chevy back out on the cement (huh)
I'm from the city where they kill for nothin' (nothin')
And all Renzel do is push a button (woop)

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen (let's get it)
I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen
I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen
(All my niggas! I'm talking all my niggas!)
I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen (Maybach Music)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I pull my pistol then I say my name (boss)
I know you scared but repeat yo game (word)
You off to hell when you see them flames
Now pray for me cause I done did some thangs (huh)
