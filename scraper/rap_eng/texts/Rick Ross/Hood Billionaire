[Verse 1]
Kilo at the telly, bitch it's Makiaveli
Double M empire, I know these niggas fear me
I'm already rich, I'm tired of bein' famous
I done fucked all these bitches, I can't even name 'em
But if the bitch is bad, bring her, yellow stone on my finger
Mink coat, mine cheetah, before I fuck I'm gon' eat her
All I talk is that cash, Versace all in my bag
Dope all in my vein, hoes hollin' my name
White T still pimpin, Lenox Mall in a Bentley
He a fuckboy, that's simple, I ain't into what he into
Hoes wave to my window, keep a pile of that endo
I always got bond money, you don't know what I've been through
Carol City niggas, still 187
Lil' Haiti niggas, still 211
Opa Locka' niggas, still got them quarters
Overtown niggas (billionaire), still movin' water

[Verse 2]
Let me show you how to get right, whip an ounce of that white
Fast forward to a brick, now you livin' that life
I can get you that in my hood, I'm a billionaire in my hood
Tryna buy a piece of the Dolphins, 5% and I'm good
Now I think I'm Don Shula
Pull up with 20 bitches on the hundred footer
All white me gusta, oh hallelujah
Oh hallelujah, oh I maneuver
Memphis niggas, still get it right (Tennessee)
Mississippi niggas still get it right (Las Vegas)
Florida boys, know we gonna get it right
Alabama hustlers, you gon' get it right

[Verse 3]
I went and bought your bitch a washer and a dryer
Seen it in your son's face, I'm who he admires
Rules of the game, jack of all trades
Icy on the court at the basketball games
Nigga, tell your pops I got a million dollar watch
All you fake watch bustas, I'm the one to watch
Rolls Royce fake and my two yachts fake
30 franchises, show you what this pot make
Make the most in the Ghost, fuck Huffington Post
Young brother Rolls, Belaire Rose, I'm makin' a toast
At the Heat game, talkin' all cash
Still tweetin' while ya'll eatin' out of our trash

[Outro]
Chi-town niggas, we gon' get it right (Detroit)
New York niggas, time to get it right (Jersey waddap)
Philly niggas, know we gon' get it right
Dreamchasers, we gon' get it right
Shoot and run, we gon' get it right
305 niggas, we gon' get it right
20 for the bird, better get it right
Got a bag of money, nigga get it right
If you owe me somethin', better get it right
Hood billionaire, time to get it right
Hunnit million nigga 'til I get it right
Hunnit million nigga 'til I get it right
