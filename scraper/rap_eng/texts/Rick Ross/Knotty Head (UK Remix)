[Intro: Rick Ross]
It's history right here
Wassup my nigga?
It's time to empower these niggas, baby, do it for the city
We got to give it to them raw though, ya heard me?

[Verse 1: AJ Tracey]
J-11 skeet skeet (skeet)
23s, word to Reekz (Reekz)
I put sauce in these skreets (skrr)
Smashing grams and no deets (smashing)
Brodie Dave had the squares (Dave)
Rockstar with them tears (tearing)
I was juugin' like I'm Rick Ross
Losing weight eating pears (uh!)
Teeth and neck or Smart Water (water)
Richy Rich, I'm that porter (I am)
Send a lamb to that slaughter
Slaught it, chopper 9 to that quarter (chop chop)
Niggas talk but don't bang (Bow!)
Niggas sell but don't slang, damn (trapping)
Judge got bacon in, damn, oh man
They so nice in that can (free 'em)
Flowers and snakes on my garments (Gucci)
I fuck models in apartments (uh!)
Eating dinners as my starters
Tryna hit the belly, no Cartman (belly)
Shotty make a nigga cartwheel
I had molly for the half deal (what?)
Hoe shot me down with a crossbow (uh?)
Now I don't know how a heart feel (nah)
I got uncles and they aren't Phil (nope)
If she ain't fucking, she can't chill (skrr)
Grey niggas dip up your trackies, err
That's a savage, you can ask Dill
I used to say a bag on the outfit casual
Now it's ten bag when I step out (step out)
Couldn’t buy a trim back then, I was stressed out
Now peng tings get their chest out

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
U.L.T for life and I'm gon' rep it till the death of me
My physical and spiritual is never sold separately
Medically inclined forever feeling that the sky is better
Sky is not the limit my attitude will disguise the weather
Under my sweater I'm feeling as if I'm under pressure
I need a Smith and Wesson
You say I need a lecture
I got a dead brother plus I've never seen my mother
Question my feelings of her
Asking me if I still love her

[Pre-Hook: Denzel Curry]
Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, blowin' dro
Call me knotty head cause I don't give a fuck
I was raised off in the projects, know this life ain't meant for us
Bitch I can't be touched
Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, let it go
Call me knotty head and if I ever go
Tell my mama that I love her cause tomorrow not for sure
I would never know

[Hook: Denzel Curry]
Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas
Told her I might hit a lick
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Found another body in the lake
Same day another tattoo on his face
Obituary on his mother’s fireplace
Baby mother fuck another sucker on a blind date
Shots fired every night I’m tryna mind mine
Dolphin Gang, Bello cigars on the sideline
Pussy niggas you can see it on his timeline
Hatin' on his dawg, shit I’m tryna find mine
Calm nigga when I’m lit up I get Von Miller
Rich niggas if you real then you can run with us
Educated reading books I’m talkin Art of War
Whippin yoda yayo residue on the marble floors
I wanna see my niggas with the flyest clothes
Came to put my city on that’s if I’m right or wrong
Pulling into Risco Park in the richest cars
And I’m thinking of my dawgs since I’m livin wrong
Jehovah’s witness swear to God I done seen it all
Picking up the pistols every time the dogs bark
You pointing fingers but them choppers cutting arms off
D.C.C.C. we came to warn y'all
Mothafucka damn right we came to warn y'all
Mothafucka damn right we came to warn y'all
Curry what’s up! Double M
It’s futuristic shit
