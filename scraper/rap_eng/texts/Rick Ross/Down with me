[Verse 1 Bobby Is The Man (Lord Twinkletoes)]
When I'm all alone in this freakin' room
I get nervous whats to come
Why don't you come with me
We can get bad (damn)
We spend all the money just don't spend it on drugs
I'm going to count all Bieber's (Money)
Come to the bed we can have some fun
All I think is about (drugs)

[Chorus 1 Bobby Is The Man]
Baby are you down for me
Cause I'm down for you
So why don't you come down with me
Girl why you gotta be so harsh
Baby are you down for me
Cause I'm down for you
So why don't you come down with me
Girl why you gotta be so harsh

[Verse 2 Lord Twinkletoes]
Drugs gotta take them
Again about drugs
Need them drugs in my wallet
Usually get busted with drugs but who give a crap
I know I don't
Drugs can't live without them
I could by you a tub full of drugs
Cause I've been poppin' pills all day
Drugs couldn't even stop
Drugs I have the drugs
So love me if you want the drugs
If you don't love me all you get is a pill
We could be down together

[Chorus 2 Bobby Is The Man]
Baby are you down for me
Cause I'm down for you
So why don't you come down with me
Girl why you gotta be so harsh
Baby are you down for me
Cause I'm down for you
So why don't you come down with me
Girl why you gotta be so harsh

[verse 3 Lord Twinkletoes]
I want to be with you
I want to be with you
I want to be with you
I want to be with you
I want to be with you
You want to be with me
You want to be with me
You want to be with me
You want to be with me
You want to be with me

[Chorus 3 Bobby Is The Man]
Baby are you down for me
Cause I'm down for you
So why don't you come down with me
Girl why you gotta be so harsh
Baby are you down for me
Cause I'm down for you
So why don't you come down with me
Girl why you gotta be so harsh
