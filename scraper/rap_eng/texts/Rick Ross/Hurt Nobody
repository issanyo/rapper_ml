[Intro: Friday]
They both at work
Where your ass need to be, nigga
Excuse me, brother
What we call drugs at 74th street Baptist church we call a sinny-sin-sin
Well, around here between Normandie and Western
We call this here a little twenty-twen-twen
Well
Nigga
Just give me a little for my cataracts
You didn't put in on this, man
It's better to give than receive, my brother
Look, look. She bendin' over
Lord have mercy
The Lord is my shepherd
He know what I want

[Verse 1: Lil Dred]
I'm higher than a motherfucker, right now
Shoot a nigga dead in this shit right now
I'm so motherfuckin' fly got your bitch in the free landline right now
Girls just wanna have fun
She ain't wanna never grow up
Lil' mama wanna roll with me
I told her mama roll one up
Slight trigger get that liquor pour up
Im'a leave her bite that bitch tore up
Get a bucket just in case I throw up
Hold up let me switch the flow up
Now, now ridin' with me
No, we ain't a group nigga, no pretty ricky
We them hot boys puttin' on for the city
I'm the type that flame up when the streets get chilly
They ain't even from where I'm from, but they feel me
Because where I'm from were you blessed to see twenty
A whole lotta' hate and a whole lotta' envy
And that's why I blow smoke like a chimney
And sometimes I just flow on a remy
Like I'm cat-walkin', you ain't really hear me
Miami bite like my dog, got that 2-50
Bites up guns down, everybody say it with me boy I really

[Chorus: Chad]
Damn I need some loud right now
Damn I need some loud right now
I'm like damn I need some loud right now
Damn I need some loud right now
A little bit of [?] won't hurt nobody
I said little bit of [?] won't hurt nobody
A little bit of [?] won't hurt nobody
A little bit of [?] won't hurt nobody

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Let's slide through the city slow
Hit finger lickin' with a pretty hoe
Middle school sellin' crack to the principle
I'm in a city where these niggas feel invencible
I'm just wanna make it through the night
Even when you doin' wrong, still gotta do it right
Last week when people hit him with the [?]
Two lives won't never see daylight
Seen a boy die for a dolla bill
That boy alive on the [?]
Them boys [?]
Bust 'em like a [?] nigga outta here
Them niggas always wanna hitch hike
Couldn't walk 'em out so you had to [?]
Black bottle on the invite
Your BM [?]
Bust shots at your whole army
Money longer than Joe Robbie, who's gonna stop me?
Disappear with your fake diamonds
Pussy nigga take all your fake [?]
My dog a killer but he rightous
Sue you niggas for the rhythm [?]
Had to sue you niggas for the rhythm

[Chorus: Chad]
Damn I need some loud right now
Damn I need some loud right now
I'm like damn I need some loud right now
Damn I need some loud right now
A little bit of [?] won't hurt nobody
I said little bit of [?] won't hurt nobody
A little bit of [?] won't hurt nobody
A little bit of [?] won't hurt nobody
