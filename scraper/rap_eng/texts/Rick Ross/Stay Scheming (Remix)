RIP to all the real niggas worldwide
Salute, Real Shit

I ride for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas
I slide for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas

Stay schemin'
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin'
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas

Damn, life so short, fuck it, I don't wanna go to court
Fuck it, got a budget for the lawyer though
Fuck it, I'm on the run for the money
I'm in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil' niggas thuggin', even got me paranoid
I'm gettin' money, that's in any nigga category
Double M I got G's out in California

[Hook]
I ride for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas
I slide for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas

Stay schemin'
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin'
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas

[Hustla Boss]
I heard you were at the finish line so I can't wait to run over you
On my way to the top bitch am always going through

Heading for a better life, it's long trip ahead so am packing light
Born hard on my way to success I usually catch a flight

They tried to catch me by surprise but am always ready
This life I live is so balanced call it calm and steady

Am looking at these niggas from the hill’s top
They tried to push me to see if I will ever drop

Take a leap into my world, you won't need any brakes
I do it fast I do it good I do what it takes

I eat problems for breakfast; I just thought you'd better know
Am hotter than fire but am still human though

I don't succeed, I just success
I like the truth naked like I like women without their dress

You could only beat me to death ... if I let you jump first
Some call it hate some call it jealousy I call it thirst

I ride for my niggas dawg
I slide for my niggas dawg

Street killas tryna get at me

Rage and cold blood that's the modafucking recipe

I am sick of these niggas talking behind my back
We still scheming and teach ya’ll bitches how to act
