[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
I used to stay up late and debate
Now I'm up late counting this cake
This shit a feeling but I'm tripping cause
I ain't really happy as I'm supposed to be
It's getting hard cause I been losing people close to me
I'm just the young hustler, I'm learning how to cope early
And I can see a death trap even if it's perdy
A lot of bitches be dirty so they just don't deserve me
Watch her hind move because I'm seeing that this life can murk me
I watched Biggie, I watched Pac, I watched Pimp C
And you get driven the sipping when you get in deep
Out here living for these niggas, it's so fucking silly
Hating when you sitting in front of God like you, DJ Envy
I had Breakfast Club meetings with my brother Rickie
And if you think he tried to change me, you fucking crazy
If an album went wrong, I did it on my own
Many people thought Rockie was a stepping stone
Lot of parts in my life, I had to roll a dice
But I learnt from my mistakes, I woulda did it twice
Now them diamonds in my bezel shining like the city lights
The 36 flow is just a nigga city view
And Balmain and bape on me, this ain't nothing new
But I ain't trippin' cause it don't make me better than you
Yeah, I'm blessed with pussy niggas, I got 'em reviewed
My 100s Blue Devil on me like I play for Duke
"I never had a chance", that's just an excuse
Got my dreams, hit the stars, I'm turning them loose
So funny, had these fuckboys switched on me
They like "Damn, lil' Rockie got rich, homie"
Now I'm smoked out with these two chicks on me
He like pears so I passed it to the big homie
Talking 'bout money, we don't play about it
Talking 'bout some drama, I can stay without it
But you know it all comes with the fame
They say you only get remembered when you got a name
7 others died with Aaliyah on the plane
I don't know nobody else, should them niggas feel the shame
Said I had a fear of flying, if I can't save hip-hop
Can I least save a young nigga from dying?
Save a mother from crying 'less it's tears of joy
Tell a father he's supposed to be there for his girl and his boy
Staying on a hustle with all of the right reasons
To give the right gifts on holiday season

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Secrets come for free if you wanna know
But homies know I'm on the low, fucking and busting a hoe
In the ghetto in our pockets all we had was dreams
If I'm given any chance, I'mma shoot a three
From the bleachers, know my daddy rooting up in Heaven
Niggas jealous, they can't imagine how much you stressing
Homie looking at me [?] stepping out of cars
Model chick, she from New York, you should look at her
Stepping in a nigga way that's donkey of the day
Down to do a nigga dirty, put him in his place
And regardless of my ways, I would tend to pray
Ask them niggas that you praise, do they have a faith?
Air Condition for niggas who's under one condition
Hurt home, your mother gone but she a Christian
Sort of a football star,  his father never visited
But who am I? Another rapper holding on his pistol
Signing off, yes, it's fat boy, Ricky Rizzle
