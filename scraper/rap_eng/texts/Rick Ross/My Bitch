My bitch, your bitch

[Verse 1]
My bitch got the tendency to put it on the scale
Your bitch got the tendency to run and check the mail
My bitch kind of pretty and her swag is super-mean
Your bitch kind of ugly but she sure fill up them jeans
My bitch on the come-up while your bitch is going broke
Your bitch, she ain't laughing, but my bitch thinks it's a joke
Your bitch like to suck a nigga up until she choke
My bitch more sophisticated cause she like to smoke
My girl finished high school and she got her a degree
Your bitch trying hard so she could get her GED
See, my bitch got that attitude to fuck a nigga right
Your bitch just ain't full of you, she just might be a dyke
See, my bitch is imported - she came from overseas
Your bitch is a hood bitch you can find up in these streets
And your bitch is the type of bitch that niggas call a ho
And my bitch is the type of bitch that's all about that dough

I'm talking about..

My bitch, your bitch

[Verse 2]
My bitch like to get it in, we be counting guap
Your bitch looking messy like she smoking rocks
My bitch she be elegant, she be turning heads
Your bitch, she ugly, I kick her out the bed
My bitch likes to cut the dope and bag it for a fee
Your bitch likely tricking off and bruising up her knees
Your bitch dumb as hell, I think she did it all for free!
My bitch roll the kush: we smoking Japanese
My bitch: she educated, walking college grounds
Your bitch selling bootlegs down at the underground
My bitch a lady but a freak up in the sheets
Your bitch fuck us up: every nigga that she meet
My bitch hustle hard and hold a nigga down
Your bitch suck a dick while another nigga pounds
My bitch is the type of bitch that niggas wanna cuff
But she only fuck with boss niggas - lames, you outta luck

I'm talking about..

[Hook]
My bitch, your bitch

[Verse 3]
My bitch is the type of bitch that niggas wanna do
It's your own fault suckas so don't get that shit confused
And your bitch is the type of bitch who really wanna lose
Ghetto with an attitude: I really don't approve
See, my bitch is the type of bitch that gotta keep it real
If that bitch don't like you, she gonna tell you how she feel
Your bitch is the type of bitch that's gonna do you bad
Lying to the children when she know you ain't the dad
See, my bitch only like me cause she know I'm from the South
She like the way I talk and the words come out my mouth
Your bitch only like you cause she thinks you getting paid
I can't wait til she find out that that's really not the case
My bitch is the type of bitch that's gonna hold me down
She ain't ever trippin when a nigga ain't around
Your bitch is the type of bitch that's blowing up your phone
Whining and complaining about when you coming home

I'm talking about..
