Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it girl
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it girl

[Verse 1: Brianna Perry]
Fuego
I'm about to let you hold somethin'
Bad bitches patted pussy like I hold' something
Tell that nigga, throw you somethin'
Cause you could do bad by yourself, you know you're stuntin'
Get it girl
Bey already told you that the girls run the world, you better...go
Get it girl
Cause you got bills, you got bills, you got bills

Maybach Music

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Baby girl, what's up?
If I own the building you attendin'
You comin' for the throne, you know who in it (boss)
Reporters ask me, am I livin'? (am I livin'?)
Well My new shit look like Staples Center
I got the haters goin' livid (goin' livid)
[?] physics
You are the motherfuckah's lightweight
You and all my dick is in this Myspace
Ballin' like DeMarquis was my cousins (for real)
I'm right around the corner from Udonis
If I shook your hand, I made a promise
[?] and medical marijuana
My girl said she heard my [?] is ten mill
Girl chill, drop it like I'm tip drill (i got that, yeah)
Big bags, I got bit bags (big bags)
She got a big ass I could dig that (boss)
Get it girl, get it girl

[Hook: Brianna Perry]
You got payments too, you betta
Get it girl, get it girl
Get it like your rent is due, you betta (go)
Get it girl, get it girl
Like Luke Skywalker with 2LiveCrew (go)
Get it girl, get it girl
Cause you got bills, you got bills, you got bills, you got bills

[Verse 3: Brianna Perry]
Haters, we don't, see them
It's funny but I need em (Yeah I do)
I'm showin' off my dance, wish I could make them pay a cause for my grant
Tell me it's the pieces hittin'
I'm feelin like i need some Loui
Wait, is you a scammer, i need that lick
Don't be too legit like Hammer
She twerkin' for Velenciaga, give me that bag for that bag
You think you gotta, nope
Little pocketbook shoes ain't shit to me
Us pretty girls play petty and get money
Get it girl, get it girl

[Hook: Brianna Perry]
You got payments too
Get it girl, get it girl
Get it like your rent is due
You betta, go, get it girl
Like Luke Skywalker with 2LiveCrew (go)
Get it girl, get it girl
Cause you got bills, you got bills, you got bills, you got bills

[Outro]
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it girl
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it girl
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it girl
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it girl
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it girl
