[Pre-Hook: Ty Dolla Sign]
Been there, done that
She a rat, she gonn' run that
Money cars clothes
Any dime piece souls
We cuff them, we pass them
Do them hoes like matter
Now 'lil bitch on madams
You ain't gotta ask I'm smashin'
You ain't gotta ask for them rollies
Everything I ride is foreign
Got a little bitch that's foreign
Fuck my other bitch she borin'
My gold 24 karats
If it ain't a nigga won't wear it
Tell her wear your own weed I ain't sharing
Tell that bitch nigga stop staring

[Hook: N.O.R.E. and Ty Dolla Sign]
'Cause we don't fuck with 'em niggas
We don't fuck with 'em niggas
No, no, no, no, no
'Cause we don't fuck with 'em niggas
We don't fuck with 'em niggas
No, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
We don't fuck with them niggas
Ain't grow up with them niggas
Never have a drink, never smoke a blunt with them niggas
It's just me and my bitch, other niggas is phoney
You know me I'm my OG
Owner off in the police
Let the bitch leave, bye bye
Connect is the plug, wifi
East coast niggas rep that NY
West coast nigga done taught me how to drive by
Consignment, money back pronto
Thumbs all green from selantro
African, killers from the Congo
And latin niggas with spears, that ill combo

[Hook: N.O.R.E. and Ty Dolla Sign]
'Cause we don't fuck with 'em niggas
We don't fuck with 'em niggas
No, no, no, no, no
'Cause we don't fuck with 'em niggas
We don't fuck with 'em niggas
No, no, no, no, no

[Verse 2: City Boy Dee]
Fuck with them niggas say
Before I drop this was a hit away
Brought the city back still niggas hate
'Cause they see a nigga straight
All go present got the bigger face
And that new benz got a different shape
Straight cash I bought forints
Pull up on that bitch in jerarintp
Used to kill the block every morning
Now the house on the hill a few g like lauren
Fresh dickies and some chucks when I'm on my calie shit
The hood pass when I land, ain't nobody gonn' trip
Og and the spliff, 32 shots in the clip
Won't fuck with him, but I fuck his bitch

[Hook: N.O.R.E. and Ty Dolla Sign]
'Cause we don't fuck with 'em niggas
We don't fuck with 'em niggas
No, no, no, no, no
'Cause we don't fuck with 'em niggas
We don't fuck with 'em niggas
No, no, no, no, no

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
First what she ever sex on a jet wit
H
In a body line in the projects with
First one I never counted hunned stacks with
Vt, did they get a bag with
2 seater sunset tell her smoke one
2 bitches that got a part of oak one
New crib nut like Barklay center
And I'm running to it days with your bay nigga
Maybach all black squad in the frat
Yay in the trunk wings on my lap
Man I boy send back ???
Now it's time for some action!
