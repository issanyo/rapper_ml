[Verse 1]
Who do you think you trippin with, I'm the ' boss
Seven forty-five, white on white that's Rick Ross
I cut 'em wide, I cut 'em long, I cut 'em fat (What)
I keep 'em comin' back (What), we keep 'em comin' back
I'm in the distribution, I'm like Atlantic
I got them pretty things flyin' 'cross the Atlantic
I know Pablo, Noriega, the real Noriega
He owe me a hundred favors
I ain't petty playla, we buy the whole thang
See most of my hustle, they still do they thing
My roof back, my money rides
I'm on the pedal, show you what I'm runnin' like
When they snatch black I cry for a hundred nights
He got a hundred bodies, servin' a hundred lifes

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We never steal cars, but we hard
Whip it real hard whip it whip it real hard
I caught a charge, I caught a charge
Whip it real hard, whip it whip it real hard
Ain't bout no funny stuff still flippin them chickens
I'm on my money stuffstill whippin' them Benzs
Major league who catchin' because I'm pitchin'
Jose Canseco just snitchin' because he's finish
I feed 'em steriods to strengthen up all my chickens
They flyin' over Pacific to be specific
Triple C's you know it's back we holdin' sacks
So go on rat, run and tell 'em that
Mo' cars, mo' o's, mo' clothes, mo' blow

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's time to spend my thrills cuz I'm spinnin' wheels
I ain't drove in a week them spinnin' still
Talk about me because these suckers scared to talk about me
Killers talkin' bout me, it ain't no talk about me
It ain't no walkin' 'round me, see all these killers 'round me
Lot of' 'round me goin' down in Dade County
Don't tote no twenty-twos, Magnum cost me twenty-two
Sat it on them twenty-twos,  twenty-two
Lil' mama super thick, she say she twenty-two
She seen them twenty-twos, we in room two twenty-two
I touch work like I'm convertible Burt
I got distribution so I'm convertin' the work
In the M-I-A-YO them niggas rich off that YAYO
Steady slangin' YAYO, my Chevy bangin' Yayo
