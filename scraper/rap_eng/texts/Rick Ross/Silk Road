[Intro]
Let's dodge rain drops
Follow me

[Verse 1]
They say I always left a paper trail
Duffle bag in the attic, now how that paper smell (wooh)
And I musta left it there for several years
In case of emergencies, go get a set of wheels
Burning tobacco with my ancestors
Learning lessons on my transgressions
Accepting that street niggas we live by different rules
Pill poppin’ everyday I’m in a different mood
They scream our names since we walk the halls (Boss)
With everything to gain only fear Allah
Full metal jacket still the wardrobe
Never waste a prayer for peace in a warzone
Pray to keep the lights on your porch on
Even better pray I get to see my boy grow
Before Instagram we did it up in the ozone
Only nigga still killing never told on

[Verse 2]
Let’s go deep into my cold mind
First and one I got it on the goal line
Fully automatic weapons for my O-line
Wanna buy the team they say I need a cosign
I got a beacon jumping out the gym
My new freak she Puerto Rican trying to reel me in
Hit the homey from the hood I told him fill me in
On top of that he said he good I told him bring me 10
Gentrification across the barren land
I thought the goal was get rich be a married man
Never question my vision I seen atrocities
But I also see profit on selling properties
Still rising enterprising young entrepreneur
Ostentatious globe-trotting out with Lira Galore (Young Coco)
Six mill I’m born I told them they can keep the change
Pick me up in that new ‘rrari swerving lane to lane

[Verse 3]
Nigga close but it’s no cigar
So it better be that Ghost or that double R
My alma mater is serving fed time
See the streets before god cut off his deadline
Damaged yard so tomorrow grows the prominence
Bastard case you can see that was some common sense
I entertain niggas under poverty lines
So I paint these pretty pictures as part of my rhymes
Crack spots block to block I’ve been a benefactor
I don’t think you understand the type of chips I’m after
Corporations but they run them like their small time
We never see eye to eye if you have a soft side
I told you pussy niggas let the lions in
I told these pussy niggas let the lions in
Your record labels left with rigor mortis
I just closed another deal worth another 40
(I just closed another deal worth another 40)
