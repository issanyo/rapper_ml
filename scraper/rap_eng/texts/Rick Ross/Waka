[Intro: Diamond Platnumz & Rick Ross]
Wasafi
Maybach Music
The black bottle boys
Huh!

[Bridge : Diamond Platnumz]
Fuck you like nobody
Sucking your whole body
Rocking everyday, party
Clean bitch playing dirty
Oh!

[Verse 1: Diamond Platnumz]
Before the night cuddle
We light up the place
And then we pop bottles
Belaire Champagnes
'Cause love is the thing that I have in my heart, and is there for you
African queen that I need and I want everyday, its only you
Leo Beki Kadaka kona
Mwendo wa kreti kwa nyama choma
Bao kila mechi, Ka' Maradona
Tukishawaka
And we sing along

[Chorus: Diamond Platnumz, Rick Ross]
Ooh lalala, ooh lalala
Ooh lalala, Yes we sing along
Ooh lalala, ooh lalala
And we go like
Waka waka, waka waka
Waka
Waka waka, waka waka
Waka waka, waka waka
Waka
Waka waka, waka waka (waka waka waka)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
(Maybach Music)
Yo Boys we jadded

Biggest boss everywhere we go, we run the streets (huh)
Never gossiping I’m only with the big talk
Black bottles so you know it’s time for lift off
Big money so you know I’m living by the code (huh)
Born winner so you know your boy can never fall (huh)
Belaire here, Belaire there
We gotta have Belaire everywhere
Bottles on ice balling all night (whoo)
Black Ferrari boss stepping out in all white (see it)
No it’s not a secret meet me at the top (huh)
Black bottle boys we can never stop (Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Diamond Platnumz]
Ooh lalala, ooh lalala

Waka waka, waka waka

I go give you cars
I’ll gift you flowers
When I put that ring on it
We will pop champagne we take shower
Until 6 in the morning

When I put that ring on it
We will pop champagne we take shower (the Black Bottle Boys)
Until 6 in the morning
Ha ha ha
