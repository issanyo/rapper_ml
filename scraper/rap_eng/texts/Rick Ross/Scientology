[Intro]
Welcome to the Scientology of hip hop
Where you must sign a life long contract as well
Welcome (Maybach Music)

[Verse 1]
You're so lucky to grow and age
Lucky to go insane, they say they spotted some cancer
Mucus built on your brain, but you tell me to keep on prayin'
Really this is a blessin', many been long and gone
Family your true possessions, admit I made some mistakes
Can't blame it on adolescence, so infected with greed
Havin' somethin' to see
I was runnin' in circles and it was right next to me
This must have been God's wishes
'Cause all my friends went to prison
Nothin' like Bryan Williams but when they come home, I kiss 'em
Hold on, give me a second, refreshin' my recollection
Labels, we playin' chess
Nothin' I'm not contested, you niggas is stupid
Thinkin' Craig Kallman won't send his shooters
They've been robbin' for years, no fear to blow out your noodles
Lookin' at B.I.G and Pac, imaginin' all the profits
Afeni sittin' at home
Picture Me Rollin knockin', no royalties in her pocket
Who really is there to blame?
Each man feed a man, children we get a gang
Scientology prophets you better stay in your lane
Let me roll up some green

[Verse 2]
This game is economics, I pray you go back to college
All I'm seein' is bitches from Queens, go back to Hollis
Made it without a father, my mother that I acknowledge
Know a crooked attorney, last name Sedlmayr
I'm breachin' these contracts, preachers and gun claps
Smokin' that Mike Dean until my lungs collapse
Bun B and Action Bronson, I'm seein' no colors
If you with me you with me, I'ma ride for my brother
Honor and pride, put the salaries aside
This lead in the water, put your prayers in the sky
Respect me as a man as you lookin' in my eye
Let's address the past, won't be no problems down the line
See confederate flags but I got a flag of mine
Yeah... yeah, I got a flag of mine!
Yeah bang, we can do it then!
I got that money for Lil Wayne, let's do it then
