[Intro]
This the realest shit in the streets
Untouchable empire
The only niggas breaking Backwoods in the Bentleys baby
Believe it
Let's get this motherfucking money
(Rich gang)

[Hook]
I'm down to fill this empty safe
I'm down to fill this empty safe
My loyal niggas gon' set me straight
My loyal niggas gon' set me straight
Trying to flip these 50 plates
It's time to flip these 50 plates
This lil' juug gon' set me straight
This lil' juug gon' set me straight

[Verse 1]
Chrome wheels on my 68
Double M strong in fifty states
My Mexicans gonna get me straight
But that phone bill it can't be late
Six mil in that interstate
I'm down to fill these empty safes
Grinding nigga wanna beat this case (Boss)
Gun charge in New York state
Ho niggas up in my face
Painkillers take pain away
Raaa them sticks come, they bang away
Raaa bang, bang, bang anyway

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Big wheels on my big V8
Fuck with me you wanna get this cake
Diamonds fill my empty safe
These hundred bills just made my day
Strip club is where we meet
Big booty is how she eats
Them fuck niggas she know they fake
I'm in the club get to flip my pays
My loyal niggas gon' set me straight
My loyal niggas gonna set me straight
My Cuban plug he got that weight
Tell Swalu come get this cake

[Hook]
