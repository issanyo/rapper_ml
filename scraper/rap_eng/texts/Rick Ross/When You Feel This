[Verse 1 : Jay Sean]
It started with a moment
We listen to it
And now, we're on a journey
I'm gonna take you home
This is a fusion
Bodies and souls fit
We're swimming in illusion
Soaking in bliss

[Chorus : Jay Sean]
When you feel this
When you feel this
When you feel this
Don't let it go
When you feel this
When you feel this
When you feel this
Don't let it go

Ooo yea e yeah
Don't let it go
Feel this
Don't let it go

[Verse 2 : Jay Sean]
It started with a moment
And we both knew it
Sits there with her eyes closed
Cold on hope
Ain't no illusion
Yeah we got proof here
Run my fingers round your outline
We're day dreaming

[Verse 3 : Rick Ross]
Big as they come the boss a reflection of trump
Took over the world for fun
Just to get in my son
Alone in this game respected i move like i'm a gang
King Alexander McQueen the boots and the minks
Dirt on my jeans I'm focused on chasing my dreams
Ain't no stopping me you copy you still copy my lean
Soprano on my jean you'll be kissing my ring
Pinky and twinkie calories they be all in my semen
Humble endeavors tickle her ass with a feather
Sparkles on bottles i order hanging off of the really
Stay ahead of the curve i get head on the bird
I know that she came I'm not saying a word
And we travel the world making love till we sweat
We live for today never having regrets
Never confess these confessions of a dawn
Checkmate back in the bucket with the pawns, ah!

[Chorus : Jay Sean]
When you feel this
When you feel this
When you feel this
Don't let it go
When you feel this
When you feel this
When you feel this
Don't let it go

Ooo  o yea e yeah
Don't let it go
Ooo  o yea e yeah
Don't let it go
