[Verse 1]
Biggest boss and I've been the trillest
I'm a bigger problem when I click with Skrillex
Murder on my mind, it's time to pray to God
My revolver's not religious, the revolution’s born
You wanna know my name then go and tell the serg'
You wanna know my gang: Suicide Squad
Pistol on my waist, I might make a mistake
Deadshot, head shot, oh my God, am I crazy?
Drugs every corner, this is Gotham City
Killer Croc came to kidnap you to cut out your kidney
Ain't no mercy, got that purple Lamborghini lurkin'
Rozay, don't you know that pussy worth it?
Flooded Rolex at the Grammy awards
They still sellin' dope, that's those Miami boys
Killers everywhere, it ain't no place to run
Forgive me for my wrongs, I have just begun

[Hook: Instrumental]
Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini, purple Lamborghini lurkin'
Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini lurkin (Rozay!)

[Verse 2]
Don't be beggin' for your life 'cause that's a lost cause
High stakes, body armor, suicide, boy
It's a time for games and it's a time to kill
Make up your mind, baby, 'cause the time is here
Capital murder, capital letters
Yeah, she catchin' my vibe, but she can't fathom my cheddar
Need a couple gang members for these new endeavors
From this point on anything we do we do together
Body on the corner, million in the trunk
Seven figures, I spend that every other month
Killers on the corner, talons in the clip
Build a palace out in Paris just to fill with bitches
Say my name and I’m coming with the gun squad
Everybody runnin', homie, there’s only one God
Cocaine white Ferrari, I'm in the fast lane
Every day was life and death, that's when the cash came
Count money, drug residue, even blood on ‘em
He had a driver 'til I put my cuz on it
Kickin' in the door, boy, Suicide Squad
Needle in my arm so I'm do or die for it

[Hook: Instrumental]
Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini, purple Lamborghini lurkin'
Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini lurkin', (Rozay!)
