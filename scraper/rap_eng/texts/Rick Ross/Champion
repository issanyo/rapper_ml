[Intro: Ace Hood]
Ace Hood

[Intro: Jazmine Sullivan]
People said I wouldn't make it (make it)
That I'd never get to the top
There was nothing they could say that would make me stop
So I had to keep pushing (pushing)
Through the pain and the tears
All the things I've been through is why I'm standing here

[Chorus: Jazmine]
That's why they can't tell me nothing (nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (nothing)
They was wrong, this the song of a champion (champion)
Thats why they can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
Let me see your hands up if you a champion

[Verse 1: Ace]
Coming up I use to watch TV
Look up at the screen
Then look at my mama
Tell her "Ma, that's gon be me"
She said "Son, you gon be great
I knew it from the start
Your daddy was a poet
That's how he captured my heart"
It's in my blood, you ask me why I keep it real
Like floatin' in a float, asking how a nigga feel
Imagine how it feels
Waking up to nothing is enough to give you chills
Waking up to nothing is enough to make you kill
Enough to bring your daughter on a heist, it's unreal
You said you gotta song living life unreal
Thats why I put my life in every song I kill
Sing it girl

[Chorus: Jazmine]
That's why they can't tell me nothing (nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (nothing)
They was wrong, this the song of a champion (champion)
Thats why they can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
Let me see your hands up if you a champion

[Verse 2: Ace]
I had a job too niggas, so what?
You haters make me laugh, how you hatin so much
Go head and do the math, watch the numbers add up
Picture me and Khaled rollin' to the Grammy's smashed up
Keep running to The Runners when its time to make a (uhh)
I'm gunning at you suckas who ain't tryna feel this shit
"My Ambitionz Az a Rider" blasting out a niggas whip
Throwing up a peace sign to all my hustlas on the strip
Top down in the chevy, yeah you know I keep it pimpin
And my pistol heavy niggas know that ain't slippin
Know that I'm on the grind niggas know that ain't slippin
My faith is on the line so you know I ain't slippin
You trippin and that's why

[Chorus: Jazmine]
That's why they can't tell me nothing (nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (nothing)
They was wrong, this the song of a champion (champion)
Thats why they can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
Let me see your hands up if you a champion

[Bridge: Jazmine]
(Lets break it down for em...)
Ladies put your hands up high
(Came too far now to give up)
We gotta keep reaching for the sky
(It don't even matter say what you want)
Fellas put your hands up in the sky
(Nothing you could say that'll make me stop)
We gotta keep reaching for the sky
(Imma keep going till I reach the top, and thats why)

[Verse 3: Rozay]
Fascinated with the life
I gravitated to the light
I sacrificed a decade
Now it's dimes every night
Let them suckas spectate
Cause shorty I expect that
We still touching big weight
And surely I invest that
Break it down the best way
Cause I know how to stretch that
Haters talking sideways
And I could never stress that
Ready for the war though
I would never compromise
Mami call me Gordo
We shine like summer time

[Chorus: Jazmine]
That's why they can't tell me nothing (nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (nothing)
They was wrong, this the song of a champion (champion)
Thats why they can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
Let me see your hands up if you a champion
That's why they can't tell me nothing (nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (nothing)
They was wrong, this the song of a champion (champion)
Thats why they can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
They can't tell me nothing (oh nothing)
Let me see your hands up if you a champion

[Outro: Jazmine Sullivan]
People said I wouldn't make it (make it)
That I'd never get to the top
There was nothing they could say that would make me stop
So I had to keep pushing (pushing)
Through the pain and the tears
All the things I've been through is why I'm standing here
