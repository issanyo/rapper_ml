[Verse 1: Miguel]
Got a mind full of TNT
I need a lunatic just like me
Paint the sky with a brush fire, yeah
Like la, la, la, la, la
I got a mind like Columbine, yeah
A vigilante, I'm volatile, yeah
I pick and choose like Duck Duck Goose
I'm close ties that you shouldn't cut loose

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
I just want someone that I can trust
Baby, is that you—is that us?

[Chorus: Miguel]
I know it's dicey
Oh, it's so good it feels criminal, ha
This shit's gotta be criminal, ha
The way I keep killing you
Though I'm dangerous, ha, yeah
It's so good it feels criminal, ah
This shit's gotta be criminal, ah
The way I keep killing you, yeah

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Pain is heaven, call it 9/11
She say, "Hello, hell, you're such a blessing"
I know way too well, now I'm finessing her
Just plead the fifth if you're ever questioned, girl

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
You see, I just want someone that I can trust
Baby, is that you—is that us?

[Chorus: Miguel & Rick Ross]
I know I'm dicey
Oh, it's so good it feels criminal, ha
This shit's gotta be criminal, ha
The way I keep killing you
Though I'm dangerous, ha, yeah
It's so good it feels criminal, ah
This shit's gotta be criminal, ah
(Sometimes you just gonna lean on it)
The way I keep killing you, yeah

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Conversations elevated when she fell in love
Stepping on her, said he did her like a dirty rug
Feeling played, underpaid, like she was Satchel Paige
Every day she had to find a way to find a way
Self-esteem is what emotions feed (Facts)
Dry land and get to travel the Seven Seas
Kaepernick of my city, lil homie, take a knee
Taking you to places selfies get taken the least
Criminal thoughts (Boss), an angel in the flesh (Yes)
It feels like we floating when we really having sex (Yes!)
Her words be so potent, scribbled 'em on my chest (Yes)
Motivation is morning, shorty, and I confess (Yes)
I'm holding you closest, that's 'til the day I rest (Yes)
I gave her a hundred, stuffed it all in her dress (Yes)
Motion picture, we them young mogul niggas (Yes)
Here's a toast to the ones who knew us before the riches

[Bridge: Miguel]
Gunplay, gunfire, grave death, stolen moments (Cheers)
5150 and lawless hearts
Raging and reckless
You know, love at large
Someday soon, stay ready with the getaway
5150 and lawless hearts
Who could stop us, babe?
The world is ours, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
I just want someone that I can trust (Yeah)
Is that you—is that us?

[Chorus: Miguel]
I know I'm dicey (Oh yeah)
Oh, it's so good it feels criminal, ah
This shit's gotta be criminal, ah (Oo ah)
The way I keep killing you
You say I'm dangerous, ha, yeah
It's so good it feels criminal, ah
This shit's gotta be criminal, ah
The way I keep killing you, yeah (uh)

[Outro: Rick Ross & Miguel]
(Ooooah ooo)
Miguel, it's going down in history once again
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love...
(Ooooah ooo
Ooooah ooo)
