[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
She just wanna fuck with me
Cuz she know I'm living comfortably
Her homegirl be tryna fuck with me
But she ain't never had no luck with me
Girl I know you're ready for it
But I'mma make you beg me for it
You want me, I already know it
She tell me I can fill that void
I play that Stevie Wonder "Overjoyed"
Cuz she be making over-noise
I think I made her blow her voice
That pussy getting over-moist
Call me when you wanna see me
I'm everywhere just come and see me
I rub it like a fucking genie
I said I rub it like a fucking genie
Girl don't fucking tease me
In this game it's too fucking easy
I'm in Compton just bumping Eazy
And these Chucks is so fucking geechi

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]
Chromed out Bimmers
Gold Alpinas
Chromed out Bimmers
Chromed out Bimmers, chromed out Bimmers
Chromed out Bimmers
Gold Alpinas
Chromed out Bimmers
Chromed out Bimmers, chromed out Bimmers

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
We headed to the top with this
I told her baby give my watch a kiss
You know it ain't no stoppin this
I'm feeling like 2Pac on this
I fight the urge everyday
I wanna bite your curves everyday
You better give this heavy play
Your ass could make the Chevy scrape
Water makes the levees brake
That Rollie with the prezi face
Your body like a eighty-eighty
I said your body like a eighty-eighty

[Bridge: Dom Kennedy]
I'm talking chromed out Bimmers
On gold Alpinas
With the chromed out speakers
And the chromed out tweeters
Them chromed out Bimmers

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]
Chromed out Bimmers
Gold Alpinas
Chromed out Bimmers
Chromed out Bimmers, chromed out Bimmers


[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
You know I had that 7 series
Believe it was the 760
All white with the beige guts
Slide for my niggas that were caged up
She know when I'm in stunt mode
Real hoes know when I'm in stunt mode
That Rolex rose gold
Yeah, that Jesus piece hang low
Them boys doing tax fraud
Wanna swipe a young nigga black card
I just bought another black R
She just had to go and tat "R"
Random, but I'm in another tax bracket
Nevermind me, I always fuck her ass backwards
You know we run this rap game
I couldn't run a lap on the track mane
Run the rap game like a trap mane
Fat nigga, fast money, just the facts mane
Run the rap game like a trap mane
Fat nigga, fast money, just the facts

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]
Chromed out Bimmers
Gold Alpinas
Chromed out Bimmers
Chromed out Bimmers, chromed out Bimmers
Chromed out Bimmers
Gold Alpinas
Chromed out Bimmers
Chromed out Bimmers, chromed out Bimmers
