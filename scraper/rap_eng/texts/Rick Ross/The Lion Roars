[Intro: Rick Ross]
Rosegold watch
All white ring
All black ghost
Cruising the Kingston street
It's the big belly, mon

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Pull up in that Rolls-Royce, can you hear the Wailers?
Hustle like I'm Bob Marley, destined for the greatest
I remember flippin' sleepin' on a pissy mattress
Man over night, filling in my father's absence
Coming from the bottom, all we did was hustle
Tryna get a dollar with a kilo in the oven
Smoke like a boss, trench Town scars
Shotta like Ki-Many, I'm just tryna live large
Penthouse suite, great bowl of weed
Blue mountain coffee, spend time with a G
Looked up in the sky, I can make it rain
The son of a legend and his message is the same

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
I see the tears on your face
Don't you weep, no baby
All this love is not in vain
I'll shelter you through the rain
The mis-takes that I made
Left us, both feeling pain
And the lion roars, when she cries

[Verse 2: Stephen Marley]
And I don't want her crying no more
Strictly kissing and hugging
Keep consensual loving
She about to die for sure
She walk with me through the fire
And love is all she require
She in the arms of a lion
Running 'round with dem shottas
Rode out to meet the boss, introduced her to ragga
She won't end up pay the cots
Her heart is all I desire
We've made it through every storm

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
I see the tears on your face
Don't you weep, no baby
All this love is not in vain
I'll shelter you through the rain
The mis-takes that I made
Left us, both feeling pain
And the lion roars, when she cries
Crying like.. ooh, ooh..
And the lion roars, when she cries

[Verse 3: Ki-Many Marley]
I'm talking 'bout love, that's my favourite topic
Open up your heart, and let nothing stop it
Even though I try, sometimes I hide the pain
I was born in love, is running through my veins
So I showed love, I gave it all away
This is the only law, that we must obey
As tears fall, from the clouds above
While the angels sing, I give dem all my love

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
I see the tears on your face
Don't you weep, no baby
All this love is not in vain
I'll shelter you through the rain
The mis-takes that I made
Left us, both feeling pain
And the lion roars, when she cries
Crying like.. ooh, ooh..
And the lion roars, when she cries

[Bridge: Stephen Marley]
I've got a lion's pride
He's got a fragile heart
I live a lion's life
She doesn't know that part
Come give it all I can
She's giving all she's got
Seems we've grown apart
Still we're all we've got

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
I see the tears on your face
Don't you weep, no baby
All this love is not in vain
I'll shelter you through the rain
The mis-takes that I made
Left us, both feeling pain
And the lion roars, when she cries
Crying like.. ooh, ooh..
And the lion roars, when she cries
