Intro:
Ricky Ross
I feel richer than ever
In fact, I am (Ha)
The Boss Rick Ross it's Deeper than Rap my nigga
Biggest album in the game it's coming soon, you feel me?
Big belly mon still eatin' this shit don't stop
That prime 112 it's a delicacy, you feel me?
Boss!

I step aboard - Louis shoes checkerboard
Tom Ford make a broad want to check a boi
Quarter milli for the chain you would never know it
But then again that explain why the neck glowin
Any way these niggas still get paid in penny weight
I don't see you nigga, shades cost twenty K
Ass hole Im a young ricky ask more
Ace in the hood good with the cash flow
Scopes on the sticks need new batteries
Dope with the the kicks I'm the shoe gallery
Got all the air max, got all the J's too
This just a hundred bars for you niggas to blaze to
You know I'm concrete 100 grand in one week
You seen john Lee counting on the front seat
Red seven trays chromed out disc brakes
Got the Cubans on hold until we get straight
Keep a clean face startin' with a mean tape
Aventura Mall top it off wit cheese cake
Sweet lemonade help a nigga ventilate
She got to suck me to fuck me won't need to penetrate
She's not penelope and no I'm not (?)
Just bigger than any of you niggas will ever be
Call me best buy cuz I got the best buys
Im on my third safe surely I can rest fine
For the record pussy far from a c.o
Steppin out the shower smelling like a kilo
Bust a pussy nigga head you can sue me
But play me like a pussy you will never do me
I start my day off like im bill gates
Keep yall haters on the outside of the steel gates
Dave mayes wanna know if I deal weight
Lookin like a ghost singing with his pale face
Got to love its the media
I'm the biggest rapper google me Expedia
The boss is in a great mood
Should be a 20 millionaire right into April
Yeah im starin at my calendars
Hi haters im waving at my challengers
Bye haters niggas waving silencers
No you niggas will never silence us
I got her pussy dripping like water
Im sitting back and im sippin life water
Im getting stacks my nigga
So when you see me you dont even have to ask my nigga
20 niggas on the bus, thats 20 niggas that I bust
You ain't fucking wit me (ay man)
