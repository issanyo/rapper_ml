You fuckin’ with that nigga
Girl you made the right choice
My hands all in your pants
I know to get that thing moist

Grown talk shorty, shit every girl want me
She said I’m the only one
I ain’t no motherfuckin’ dummy
I keeps it pimpin’, pimpin’ to the core

Top a nigga’ off with some Christian Dior
And we don't do hummers drop heads for the summer
Rovers in the winters, escalades is just for beginners
Look, she’s smoke too, just like me, we get along great

Discussions over wine, and tell me ‘bout your long day
She say work got her stressed
Well, let me help you out that dress
And I don’t mean to preach

But your pussy shall be blessed
Kissing down your back, molly got her relaxed
Chills down that body, I give that ass a smack
Sex on the beach, I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout the drink

Knocking dishes over got her on my kitchen sink
She say “Bow, you’re a beast”
I tell her “Yeah, I know”
Them hoes let my swag maybe ‘cause I’m from the O

Smokin’ on somthin while she rubbin’ on my chest
Asked her if this dick good, she replies with a ‘yes’
I’m so deep in it, got her so wet
I might fuck around and sink in it

We in the bathroom doing the most
I got the Trojan can’t get burned like toast
I don’t know what it is about us
Shorty keep me coming back

Have fun every time I’m wit’ her
And if my girl found out I know she’d have a heart attack
What she don’t know won't hurt her
No, what she don’t know won’t hurt her
