[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
From the bowels of the gutter, child and his mother
Myself and marijuana to greet you is an honor
Sneakers crossed the thigh, I do these in the summer
Can't fuck with house niggas, bitch I been a runner
Forces on the coupes, smokin' on the Snoop
My bitch enrolled in F.A.M., then she bust a U
All I talk is yay', fuck you and that GPA
Forgiatos on this shit and people wanna confiscate
Rest in peace my nigga Raymond, I'mma still make you famous
Every bottle that I pop, I know them pussy niggas hate it
Me against the world, it's hard to sleep when you the hottest
My new bitch, she be the thickest, she never outta pocket
Alias Petite Felipe, that's when I'm out in Caans
When in KOD, my bitches only call me Bandz
Bandz, ya frat boy got the Benz
And we them niggas stuntin' every chance

[Hook]
Order us a round, order us some more befo'
Dollas hit the ground, we be throwin' up some mo'
Sprite with the syrup got me movin' hella slow
If these niggas didn't know, I'mma hide to let 'em know
It's just us, nigga, aw yeah, it's just us, nigga
It's just us, nigga, aw yeah, it's just us, nigga
It's just us, nigga

[Verse 2]
I swear I got here thru the science
And all my niggas here, so stop questionin' our alliance
And those that stay true, I do this shit for you...
It's that put it in the back flow
Doin' no stand, my nigga, I want it all flow
This that all a nigga need: some head, some good weed
The bitch with the fresh weave
Who's willing to succeed, we be chillin' at the top
Now we gettin' to this bread, all the birdies wanna flock
And I focus on the finer talk, crumpets on the China, gold
Prezzy with the diamonds, told you niggas it was timin'

[Bridge 2x]
We payed off from that grindin'
And look, all my niggas shinin'
And I hope every time you played this
This shit just a reminder

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Sit back and I'm focused but ya already know this
And the ho's sure before I walked in, I really go, bitch
Flexin' all o' these suckas and I'm flexin' all o' these hoes
My time is always your paper, never worry 'bout these hoes
And I swear my life is so amazin' and you niggas tryna be adjacent
My mind stay go get it and you niggas stuck and complacent
Try a nigga whif come out like Jason
Ride down Collins with a few Asians
Money out the roof like the shit don't faze me
I don't give a fuck if you niggas due hatin'
Prolly cause your bitch didn't wanna you datin'
So I know you niggas hate it, bitch we ballin' like the Lakers

[Bridge] + [Hook]
