[Intro]
They say money is power
And if that's the case, we got millions of power
With kush and lean on my breath
Let's go underground on these commericial niggas man
Bawse!

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Yeah, 16, I caught my first coke case
Crackers jumped out, ransacked my folks' place
Took me to Dade County for a short stay
It was somethin' small, but chickens was my forte
Lord forgive me for my sin but I have to serve (Lord!)
Starin' out of a Benz is what I deserve
When every nigga that you know got a felony
How will I every get to grow into that better me
That's why we all broke, that's what you tellin' me?
Momma go to church and shit's so far from heavenly (Lord!)
Let me tell you about the last beef
Ak-47 seven times seven feet
Gave that bitch a bloodbath
Shit is organized, you gotta bring them drugs back
And what made it worse, the killer was fuckin' his sister
Brother was the victim, she fell in love with a villain
Pretty cars, I slept with pistols all under the pillow
Shotty all in the kitchen, heard over a bowl of cereal
This deeper than rap
I guess a box of Cap'n Crunch get you deeper than that
I got thirty ounces in my shoe box
I'm on 2 pills and think I'm hearin' 2pac
And I'm so rich, bitch, I could get high
Once everythin paid off I could just die
I always had a plan to let your grand wizard
Send trembles through the land when that man whisper
Go on, sacrifice your sister, let the boys flip her
This is deeper than rap and I still keep it trilla
This deeper than rap(5x)
Gangstaaaaaa
