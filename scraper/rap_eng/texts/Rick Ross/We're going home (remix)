(Introdução: Rick Ross)
Shorty I got more money than I've ever had
You the only thing I need right now
You make it all so simple
You my new thing

(Verso 1: Rick Ross)
I fuck her like an addict
She fuck me like she mad at me
But it's all cool though
I flew out the niche just last week
When I'm away she send me pics in the sheets
All my cars, and my sneaks
Wait, let me keep this shit simple
Fuck the radio, this just a nigga tempo
Fat boy, blue jeans, and a gold watch
Started at the bottom, and she rolled on top
Black Testarossa, 0-60 on the strip, she's explosive
Just got back from Dubai
Emirates live, flew in with 1. 5
Never fold is the threshold
Like my mother sayin', now never let go
Hood nigga with a
Bad bitch, but she special
Went home, and I prayed for an angel
Appeared in the dark, here to take away the pain too
War wounds on the big dawg
But she get the ball like it's tip off
Watch D-Wade, got two seats
Got her everything but the
Cardier wings, nigga, two seats
Nigga gettin' money like a new Meech
We the knights of the Templar
Dirty little nigga with ten cars
This whole click another Enron
Baby girl it's time for you to get gone
There's a shoulder just to lean on
Rozay baby, and the team strong

(Bridge: Drake)
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

(Refrão: Drake)
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home

(Bridge Hook)

(Interlude: Majid Jordan)
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby
