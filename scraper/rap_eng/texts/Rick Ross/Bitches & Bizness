[Duke]
We gone do it like this
From the A-T-L
All the way down to the 305 MIA
Cocaine capital nigga
Yeah the boyz n da hood

[Rick Ross]
The bizness is bitches
The pussy I keep in my pocket
The niggas keep watchin'
They know I'll be rockin' my watches
G's keep knockin'
They know I'll be shootin' to spot 'em
The boyz n da hood strictly distribute the product
My niggas get slizzard
I'm smoking' and chillin' in pradas
Fuck a 9 to 5
We gone just do what we gotta
I'm in the chevy thang
Everything runnin is proper
Dont come to close
Cause I'm subject to ?? my chopper
We in the streets (in the streets)
Who got the weed (got the weed)
I got a couple keys
Wanna eat fuck wit me
You don't want to see me pissed off (yeah)
Fuck until my dicks soft (boyz n da hood)
Nigga this is Rick Ross

[Jody Breeze]
Now I rock a lot of ice cause I'm keeping' it slum (I'm keeping' it slum)
Six lugs at the bottom lockin' keep 'em in tone
Crack rock cocaine what we keep where I'm from
You don't believe me nigga come and see where I'm from
Keep 2 or 3 heaters dug deep in my bum
The police tryin' to keep the concrete on my palm
But I got shit to do
And I got bricks to move (okay)
But y'all are payin' for 4 mil
You can get for 2 nigga
And try to play me dude
And I'm gone put yo ass in some baby shoes
And I don't mean the ones that your babies use
I know I talk about my niggas a lot, But I shoot too
Give me something to nut up about and watch me shoot you

[Chorus - Jody Breeze - 2X]
I woke about 6 in the morning'
Gotta get paid fuck moanin' and groanin'
Hit the block get the truck rollin' (rollin')
By the night time our pockets is swollen (swollen)

[Big Dee]
From dust to dawn we stay posted up in project homes
Keep a plastic tone y'all want it bring it on
We'll creep up in yo home
Hangin by yo bitches thongs
Say you's a gorilla say what happened to King Kong
We real play makers and this is not ESPN
Welcome to the gutter now watch the shit fest begin
Ain't no fuckin' Jack Triple but I'm bakin' cakes
Plus my cakes more then triple what that fag makes
Fuckin' just to stay awake makin' sure I don't stumble
Granted till my bank statement look like social security numbers
Call us cookie monsters makin' cookie niggas crumble
Catch a double digit jersey number if you fumble

[Duke]
I'm gone tote the poll lock and load
Shoot till you hear that BOW
Take my time speak my mind like I'm ??
Got a country slang baby you can tell ain't it
You can kill too a lot of us got them feds at us
Still keep a stankin' kitchen
Cause in the midst of the caine on the way the crack smell durin' the intermission
Triple beam hand held hank sty
Got some caine stain colored on the finger nail
Chrome black dished back up til' I ??
Saw him walk a thin line but its not a fat red
I'm gone rap for these packed heads
Gats crack sells sex and blacks that want to stack mils
Smokin' on the purple stack runnin' in yo house
Ramblin' wondering where the work is at
Hoes in the third still hollerin' where the purses at
Phone in Atlanta ring the family where they murked at (hey)

6:45 am life's great got the bacon soda I'm cookin' pancakes (that's right)
Where I'm from nigga I'm the man
Take him out, break him down like a lap dance (yeah)
I ain't playin' I got hella choppers
Call my partners then they got helicopters  (that's right)
Just like my old job but a lil' different (what)
I used to work at churches chicken
But now I cook my chicken to my own kitchen
A kitchen fork and a glass pocket
Try to rob if you want get ya ass shot

[Chorus - 2X]
