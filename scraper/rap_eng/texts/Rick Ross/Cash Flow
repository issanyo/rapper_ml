[Intro: DJ Khaled, T-Pain & Rick Ross]
We the best Def Jam
I introduce you to Ace; Ace, let's get money!!
(Cash flow) Haha, it's too easy, nigga
(Bank roll) We don't count money no mo, we weight that shit
Let's get it

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Aye, knock knock, bang bang, where the cash at?
If you ain't got it, leave you bloody like a Tampax
Come up swinging at you thugs Aflac
Then I fall in the suede black Maybach
See, I'm back for the money like I left that
See I be running on the route where the cash go (where the cash go)
And any nigga interfering with the cash flow
See, you can get pumped on like a Citgo
Make his body bounce bounce like a 64
Tall clips, chrome lips, see the big gold
I'm a duffle bag boy like I move coke
Big crack through the music so the flow dope
I keep my money over bitches til the door close
I need money like a bitch need dick mo'
I'm trying to see it like a motherfucking cash flow
Rubber bands in my pants, understand, bankroll

[Hook: T-Pain]
I'll tell you one thing, don't play about mine
I be banging on your front door with the nine
I'ma come see ya (see ya)
I'ma come see ya (see ya)
I need all my dough not a dollar short
And if you don't have it then you got to go
I'ma come see ya (see ya)
We put our hands in the sky let em know that we 'bout that
Cash flow, I need it on time
I'm talking bank roll - my money, my money, my money
Cash flow, I need it on time
I'm talking bank roll - my money, my money, my money

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
And where my money? Young nigga's gotta have that
Rubber bands by the grands in a big bag
Pockets fat like I'm carrying a backpack
A couple grand for the Louis band knapsack
Understand I'm the man who you can't match
Money man minivan full of brown bags
Bet a grand, any man never top that
Touch money and the gat pop those straps
Get in the Coupe and the top drop right back
I ain't playing, creep your avenue and I'll blast
Bust shots like a New Year's Day blast
And I ride all day like a bus pass
Grinding hard for the bread and the cash flow
Kick doors, wave 4's, where the cash go (where the cash go)
I'm trying to see it like a motherfucking cash flow
Rubber bands in my pants, understand, bankroll

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Ace, I see you nigga
Trilla, you M.O.B now nigga
You untouchable

Big money in the dope hole
See the beamers when you pull up in the dope home (my money)
Seventeen and he got his own kilo
Running green, nigga living like Nino
Ridinâ€™ clean wax hit me for the c note
It ain't green, get it back with tha C loc
Momma dead broke, daddy fucked up
I'ma make them come and hit me with the RICO
God damn it, I'm still in the dope spot
Why the fuck you think I pull up in a dope car?
Gold shoes, stepping out with a dope bitch
Cartel, so she gotta suck four dicks
ID me, V.I.P
DJ Khaled, M.O.B
Girls so hot, Ace so cold
Taking bets, Ace won't fold

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Outro]
Hey, we go by The Runners... just in case you forgot
We did it again...
