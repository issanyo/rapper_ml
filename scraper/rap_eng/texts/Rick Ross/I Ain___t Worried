[Intro: DJ Khaled]
This We the Best Music, WTB

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
I ain't worried, I ain't worried
Every time I jump on a beat, these niggas get nervous
Ho naw, I ain't worried, just know I ain't worried
Rap game that's mine due time ain't lyin', y'all gotta be worried
Ho naw, I ain't worried, these niggas ain't worthy
Long as my family straight, you know homeboy I ain't worried
Ho naw, I ain't worried, ain't worried bout 'em
Ain't worried bout 'em, naw

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
The illest nigga know this, the king cat has spoken
I run the south and you run your mouth
So please quit with the assumptions
Niggas in the Benzo 10-4
Ridin' with the chopper clip extendo
Ain't no game, this ain't Nintendo
Blowing on the highest grade of indo
Rockin' Givenchy, Givenchy, Givenchy
Hop on the beat and I catch me a body
Millionaire hundred million deposit
Just so my niggas, we each can divide it
Talkin' bout money all over the table
Money all over the floor
Killaz they all in the Porsche
Pourin' champagne on them whores
All my nerves best rolla, Ferrari doin' donuts
Ain't worried bout a damn thing, young nigga big nuts, ha!
Laughing at all you rap niggas out tryna sound like Hood
You can keep that flow, hope it tastes good

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
I ain't worried, I ain't worried
Every time I jump on a beat these niggas get nervous
Ho naw, I ain't worried, just know I ain't worried
Rap game that's mine due time ain't lyin', y'all gotta be worried
Ho naw, I ain't worried, these niggas ain't worthy
'Long as my family straight, you know homeboy I ain't worried
Ho naw, I ain't worried, ain't worried bout 'em
Ain't worried bout 'em, naw

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
First 48, ahah, yeah
I'm a threat to these niggas, it's kill or be killed
On the night he get murdered, I be somewhere in Brazil
The Feds tappin' my raps, got the keys to success
My whole team gettin' rich, I know these haters feel pressure
Retaliation a must, put a bag on it, nigga
All day he on Twitter, straight rat on a nigga
I'm Mr. drivin' my Bentleys, all my foes gettin' mad
Underground I'm a king, posting pictures with Chad
Swisher Sweets in my luggage, Belaire in my bucket
Niggas know where I be, we straight mobbin' like Duddy's
Ace gon' be my nigga, I make him clap through your window
Better watch how you talkin', this SK be a blender

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
I ain't worried, I ain't worried
Every time I jump on a beat these niggas get nervous
Ho naw, I ain't worried, just know I ain't worried
Rap game that's mine due time ain't lyin', y'all gotta be worried
Ho naw, I ain't worried, these niggas ain't worthy
Long as my family straight, you know homeboy I ain't worried
Ho naw, I ain't worried, ain't worried bout 'em
Ain't worried bout 'em, naw
