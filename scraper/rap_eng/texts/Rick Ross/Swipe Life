[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Picture me in the club, all the models around, big
Tip for the bottle girl, all the bottles around
Just bought me a brand new Bim', so I stunt when I come around
Fuck all my enemies, I'ma stunt when I come around

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Hunnid swipes, got a couple hundred off a swipe
Swipe, bought a Bentley off a swipe
Swipe life, got two Rollies off a swipe
Swipe, oh, holy moly, swipe life, swipe life

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Stolen identity, whenever I put it down
Fuck all my enemies, whenever they come around
My homie done did a year, nigga you held it down
So I bought him a brand new Benz, now he stunt when he come around

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Hunnid swipes, got a couple hundred off a swipe
Swipe, bought a Bentley off a swipe
Swipe life, got two Rollies off a swipe
Swipe, oh, holy moly, swipe life, swipe life

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
My goons all in that van
My shoes all in advance
My tools all from Afghan
Poppy seed residue on my hands
Sacrifice for my gang
You test me, know you're testin' my aim
I drop them bombs all in your barrack
Barack callin' my name
I just grabbed a new Benz
Took them stocks off of that thing
I put them 4s under that bitch
Got your bitch rockin' all of my chains
I been rich a long time
That boy be still droppin' that flame
Been rich a long time
That boy there still got the cocaine
I pay for the Cad', I might swipe the card
Then I may get head, or I might wipe your broad
I'm cutthroat like that, I cut dope like this
And since I'm always on your mind, can't forget I'm rich, bitch

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Swipe, got a couple hundred off a swipe
Swipe life, bought a Bentley off a swipe
Swipe, got two Rollies off a swipe
Swipe life, oh, holy moly, swipe life, swipe life

[Verse 4: A$AP Ferg]
Henny, Mo' up in my coupe
Skeet is all up on her tooth
Beeper goes off, I'm like, "Who?"
Why I go off in the booth
Better be watchin' your tongue when you speak
Don't even talk to me, please
I keep that banger on me
Swipe and get all of my cheese
I bought my mom a new house
I bought my bitch a new dog
I brought my trap to the house
Bow when you talk to the lord
I come through with a banger, nigga
And I put a big diamond on her finger, nigga
And you know all the bad bitches hangin' with us
Couple rappers couldn't even get a table with us
Couple hater niggas always tellin' fables on us
Guys stealin' money, turn the tables on us
But, fuck it, I'ma keep the money real tight
Cause I gotta keep a banger with a hundred swipes

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Hunnid swipes, got a couple hundred off a swipe
Swipe, bought a Bentley off a swipe
Swipe life, got two Rollies off a swipe
Swipe, oh, holy moly, swipe life, swipe life
