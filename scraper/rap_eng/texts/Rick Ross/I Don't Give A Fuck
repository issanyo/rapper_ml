[Intro]
Chea
I’m back on my shit, nigga

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]
Keep playing with me, I’m in this bitch
And can no one fuck with me, I hear the talk
But you ain’t talking with me, keep popping off
I bet this chopper come see, I don’t give no fucks
I don’t give a fuck, nigga, I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck, nigga, I don’t give a fuck (I don’t give no fucks)
I don’t give a fuck, nigga, I don’t give a fuck (Yeah)
I don’t give a fuck, nigga, I don’t give a fuck

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Why you all on my dick?
That’s that shit I don’t like
Ho niggas can’t make me believe
I’m trappin', it’s gon' be cold nights
Fuck niggas always got something to say
I’m king, other niggas all in the way
Get your block in your whip, tip all in a day
Boss move, checkmate that was all in the play
A couple niggas don’t like me, oh well
Get a pillow while they bitch go tell
That tough men shit just don’t sell
Streets ride my train I won’t fail
I don’t lip box, I just send shots
Or put a nigga face on the back of a milk box
Fuck that rap shit, I’m a gangster
I don’t get stressed nigga, I get shit poppin'
What the fuck is you looking at, nigga?
Keep tryna play stiff and get found in a box
Just know when I show up on niggas
That Mac-11 got me feelin' like Pac
They say I’m the realest I know it
I bet I show up when I come in this bitch
I go to trippin' it’s over, no point of talkin'
It ain’t nothing to fix

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Never scared to die (No), see the look in my eye (Boss)
Nigga tried to wack me, still drop top in my ride
Fuck this sympathy ho, hit you in your El Camino
Got that eight figure park deal, nigga still quit to sling dope
Get high blowin' that smoke, I die before I go broke
Your baby mama my thot, my eighth year I’m still high
Your house less than my watch, my watch over your life
Ain’t no bitch bad than my bitch and I fucked your bitch twice
Boss sippin' that drank, Boss twistin' that dank
Boss gettin' that bank, just bought Holyfield’s estate
That’s just weed money lil nigga, where your money lil nigga
Leave a hole in your nigga, when we run down on your nigga
Punk (gunshots)

[Hook]

[Outro]
I don’t give no fucks
Yeeaah
