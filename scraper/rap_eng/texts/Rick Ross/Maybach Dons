[Intro: Game in the studio with Ray Angry, talking to Rick Ross]

[Verse 1: Game]
I used to push Keys like Alicia
Now I push a hard top Lambo, with James Bond features
Put it on D's like under this bitch T-shirt
D-boy for real, let my niggas eat first
And I was flowing over Dr. Dre beats first
So quitters can't say what I'm spitting now is a cheap verse
Nas just walked by, nigga this is ether
I'm going down classic like that nigga B.I.G serves
My niggas pushing them key's til' they see dirt
The spot is the pharmacy and the block is where we work
Niggas standing on the corner, look at these jerks
The heat starts flashing, make 'em run til' they feet hurt
I'm a hustler, nigga do your research
I put a bitch on the greyhound with a Louis V purse
I mean a suitcase
And you niggas don't know shit about crack
I'm just tryina' tie your shoelace

[Interlude: Game talks]
Hahah, yeah man!
I be doing shit though, I mean
I'll rap over trashcans, anything
Yeah I don't give a fuck about nothing man
I do this shit cause I love it
All right man!

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Yeah...
Bawse...
Walking on water, covered in ice
Governor of Florida, Babyboy nice!
I fucks pianos, I rape the drums
I kiss the mic, hits make me cum
Bricks make me numb, from the tip of my tounge
Babygirl dripping like the clip from my gun
I am the truth, brand new coupe
Run the place, take you straight back
To Martin Luther roots
Pistol never fail me, official Alex Haley
Let me chill, cause my vision getting blurry
Hailed as a boss, nailed to the cross
Rose from the dead, that Rolls Royce cost
As a matter of fact, no need for all black
I can be in all peach and wet me a Curtis Jack
I can smell the rat, still count my cheese
Count my money, still count my b's
Walking on water, covered in ice
Governor of Florida, one terms, twice
I fucks with Game, me and blood the same
I became his fam when he threw away the chain

[Piano outro: Ray Angry]
