[Hook: Kevin Cossom]
Baby we can get lifted any time of day
(Cause the drugs baby)
Cause the drugs get me feeling some kinda way (oh yeah)
Oh hell, here we go again, we did this last night
Two shots, pour Belaire or the Blue Dot
Two bad bitches blowing smoke on my rooftop, yeah
Damn you just completely reminded me (reminded me)
When you're leaving they feeling some kinda way
Oh hell, here we go again, I'm just tryna stay alive
Two shots, floor niggas shooting through your rooftop
Who got popped, young nigga tone two Glocks, yeah

[Intro: Rick Ross]
I just wanna hold your hand, sip me some Champagne, love, that's it, you heard?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Suckers for love, yes, I've heard it before
Show them my hustle which is such an incredible source
Stumble through the boutiques, always watching my step
Credit Cards in my name, she swipe them, then sign them herself
Trust is a must, never letting me down
Got her selfies with Beyonce, this is Destiny Child
Won't answer my calls after I gave you my all
Before I shed a tear, I thought I'd just write you a song
Rewrite all my wrongs, or recite you a poem
Knowing you're leaving but the question is, "Where are you going?"

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]
Baby we can get lifted any time of day
(Cause the drugs baby)
Cause the drugs get me feeling some kinda way (oh yeah)
Oh hell, here we go again, we did this last night
Two shots, pour Belaire or the Blue Dot
Two bad bitches blowing smoke on my rooftop, yeah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Shawty was a dancer, hustle was her answer
Get in where I fit in, mid-town Atlanta
Bags and boots, baby girl wanted those big things
Parking lot in magic City, since she was sixteen
Don't let them stop you baby, he can't knock you baby
When you winning is when they wanna say she not a lady
Hold your bag in the sky, all those bitches respect it
Now run home to your nigga, make sure that head is perfected
Never seeking acceptance, reaping my blessings
Fat mob figure, black Bob Dylan
If the pussy good it's hard to stay at odds with it
If she want it, you ain't got it, get on your job nigga

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]
Baby we can get lifted any time of day
(Cause the drugs baby)
Cause the drugs get me feeling some kinda way (oh yeah)
Oh hell, here we go again, we did this last night
Two shots, floor niggas shooting through your rooftop
Who got popped, young nigga tone two Glocks, yeah

[Bridge]
Your opinion, I don't care
And my niggas we show up and it ain't fair
Killing these niggas for real
Shades on but my vision's so clear
And I do this for my niggas that ain't here
Tell me 'bout I got two bad bitches to myself, oh
And I can't wait to get 'em home
She playing games with you, probably cause she with me nigga
It ain't 'bout the fame dog, it's about the figures niggas
Money, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]
Baby we can get lifted any time of day
(Cause the drugs baby)
Cause the drugs get me feeling some kinda way (oh yeah)
Oh hell, here we go again, we did this last night
Two shots, pour Belaire or the Blue Dot
Two bad bitches blowing smoke on my rooftop, yeah
