Look, I ain’t got no time, I’m chasin money
The only thing on my mind is stack them hunneds
Told my bitch I’m on my grind, she said she understand
And even if she don’t then she gonn need another man
Baby I ain’t got no time, I’m chasin money
The only thing on my mind, is stack them hunneds
Told my bitch I’m on my grind, she said she understand
And even if she don’t then she gonn need another man
Baby I ain’t got no time

[Verse 1: Ice Berg]
Now go my money talk, racked up, tood up
I guess that explain my funny walk, they hating on get 2 fucks
I’m still on that stupid shit, get your ass slit on
It’s gonn be the same story, my son ain’t dead shit wrong
For that money I go harder than a bitch
This 5% on my whip boy, it’s a monster in that shit
Don’t fuck with me, that common sence like a communist I flip
So stay about it mine nigga, you tryina get so i’m get on your grind nigga
Bad young …reporting from the land of the killers
So fucking fly I can stand on the ceiling
I’m getting riches so I can’t really vibe with my bitch
The only time we talk is when she help me on count my shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Fuck around and stumble cross a couple m's
I put 100 karats in my double m
Dope money, saving all the public shit
Hustling until all my neighbors republicans
Doubling so I tax just like the government
Dunk Ryder but none of my niggas suffering
Little niggas be replaying when they mumbling
Fuck em all we came to give em they punishment
Shook …the 45 be under it, rich nigga 50 mill I ain’t started shit
Nigga think he real, bitch I’m some other shit
Nigga keep it real, pay for your mother’s shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ice Berg]
Cause the money don’t sleep, and until I’m filthy rich
I’ma still be in these fucking streets
I’m addicted to designer, bad bitches and weed
I fuck with the same hoes as them niggas in the league
And thye know real when they see it, these diamonds be the cleanest
These vvs1′s girl I hope you ain’t anemic
And I been on the run baby I ain’t fucking off
I see when I see you, hell it’s barely time to talk
I got a bitch from out of town, always tryina text
So I flew her ass down, made a dance and got check
And she say she love a nigga but the feeling isn’t mutual
She told ain’t a damn thang to a real future, real talk
