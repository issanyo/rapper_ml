Pullin' on her, pullin', pullin' on her hair
Pullin' on her, pullin', pullin' on her hair
Pullin' on her, pullin', pullin' on her hair

I love it when she wear her hair down to her shoulders
And she know if she come over then I'ma fold her
Already told her, I'm like a boulder
Hit it 'til she feelin' like she tipsy, but she sober

Just curled her hair though she know that I'ma mess it up
But she don't care 'cause she been wantin' me to sex her up
And when we finished, she can pin it up

She love it when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She love it when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She loves it when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She loves it when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)

She love it when I'm
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She love it when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She buzzin' when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She cussin' when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)

I even love it when she wear her hair in corn rows
But she know when we finished she gon' have an afro
And she ain't trippin', man, what is she gon' get mad for?
Needed something new while sneaking in your back door

Oh, whoa, I'ma stretch her out down on that floor
And if her hair too short, she can add more
If her hair too short, she can add more

'Cause she love it when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She love it when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She buzzin' when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She cussin' when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)

Ooh, she love it when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She love it when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She buzzin' when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She cussin' when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)

[Rick Ross:]
Her performance stellar, so I gotta tell her
My paper hella def, my Ferrari yella
Versace robes by Donatella
I got Navy guns, boats like a sailor

Pullin' on her hair, borne a brother's stare
Kissin' on her neck, this gon' be a while
I'm a bad boy, yeah, I'ma tie her down
Pullin' on her hair when I tie her down

Who your first was, that don't matter now
That's long and gone, and I just want to tie you down
Who your first was, that don't matter now
I came along, and I just want to tie you down

Ooh, she love it when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She love it when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She buzzin' when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She's cussin' when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)

Ooh, she love it when I
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She loves it when
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She's buzzin'
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)
She's cussin'
(Pullin' on her hair, pullin', pullin' on her hair)

Pullin' on her, pullin', pullin' on her hair
Pullin' on her, pullin', pullin' on her hair
Pullin' on her, pullin', pullin' on her hair
