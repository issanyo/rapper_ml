[Intro: Rick Ross, Omarion]
Maybach O, (Yeah)
Rozay,(I think I'mna pull up right here)
We gonna change your life overnight love, (What's up?)
Uh
Big Money (I'm back & shit)
Fast money, (Maybach O)
Believe that, (We going to turn out the club)

[Verse 1: Omarion]
Lame ass niggas in your ear all night
Ciroc got me loose, but your dress fitting tight
My Rolly says two, but the time is three
Even though my watch wrong, girl, the time so right
I ain't selling no dreams, I ain't telling no lies
That dress so cold, but that body on fire
Ain't the smartest in the world, but looking at you girl
I'd be a fool to let the chance go by
So I'm gone

[Pre-Hook: Omarion (& Notorious B.I.G.)]
(Ask you what your interests are, who you be with?)
To convince you, I'm the one you should leave with
(Things to make you smile, what, what numbers to dial)
Girl, I got a thing for you, but it ain't no secret
If this conversation leads us
To the bed room we gon' make love
Cause girl I want to please you
And girl I really need you, so...

[Hook: Omarion]
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about tonight, baby
Let's talk about all the good things that could happen if you leave with me
You could see 'em hating if you want to
But he can't do your body like a player do, girl
(Who they attracting with that line, "What's your name? What's your sign?"
Soon as he buys that wine, I just creep up from behind)
Let's talk

[Verse 2: Omarion]
Look at them, ey-ey-eyes over here
Pop a few bottles like the first of the year
Stare so right, and the visual probably better
But I came over just to make things clear
No disrespect, girl, we both so grown
Just want you by my side when I say, "So long"
Been paying attention, niggas steady missing
Turning you off, Let me turn you on
So I'm gone

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Uh, she lookin' like a bag of money
Like a boss, so you know I let her count it for me
Like to floss, new watch, gold rings
People next door swear I'm dealing cocaine
Me and O gettin' dough like it's no thing
New Maybachs, boy, that's way out of your range
All the chicks came like we at a Knicks game
Carmelo numbers first and the fifteenth
We the best in the biz', baby there it is
I'mma handle mine, little homie handle his
At the Portofino, I just bought the top floor
I'm living like Nino baby, and want more
Now double that, Rev Run bubble bath
Overlook the city, blowing out her back
She better blow my mind or she can holla back
I get better with time, and it's a fucking wrap
