[Intro]
Know what I’m sayin’
We just some young Texas niggas
Hol’ Up
Thugga

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
We ride Forgies in Florence clothes
Black doors on fours
Forty pointers in the bizzle
Put on Ferragamo on clothes
Put on car shows for hoes
Making sure we get chose
Once you see the wrist glow
That’s when you see your bitch go
Bad bitches love bosses and them big exotic houses
She takin’ selfies in the stars
In the red room we flossin’
Never askin’ what it costs
Cash out and I’m gone
I know you haters can’t believe I’m gettin’ paper this long
My old schools is new
Only bosses in my crew
I’m a hustler motherfucker, you can’t do what I do
Every year something new that’s boss like tradition
Meet with the mayor in the mornin’
No more cookin’ in kitchens

[Hook: Jack Freeman]
Yeah, that’s big boss talk
Trying to put a hundred million in the vault
These niggas hatin’ but we let ‘em talk
Pull up to the dealership and buy ‘em all
Yeah, that’s big boss talk
Trying to put a hundred million in the vault
We do it for the south, do it for the north
Pull up to the club and watch that money fall

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I put elbows on the ‘lac
I push that bitch to the max
Presidential go roly with the white house in the box
Used to pray in the night
Lord I wanted a slice
Win me a pizza hut, yeah by shaking the dice
Bury some of my homies
Tatted all of your names
Had your son sitting with me, last time we sat at the game
Coming forward with the starters
Look like I’m Harden on stage
Got on my baby blue jogs, set of solid gold chains
Screaming “God is the greatest”
Two blocks for all of my haters
Her name slipped my mind, I know her pussy amazing
Set the truck on the swangas
She gon’ fuck her some famous
Fuck wit’ Thug out in Texas
You know bosses relate

[Hook: Jack Freeman]
Yeah, that’s big boss talk
Trying to put a hundred million in the vault
These niggas hatin’ but we let ‘em talk
Pull up to the dealership and buy ‘em all
Yeah, that’s big boss talk
Trying to put a hundred million in the vault
We do it for the south, do it for the north
Pull up to the club and watch that money fall
