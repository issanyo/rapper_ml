[Intro: Rick Ross + (DK)]
It started with a Monte Carlo
Then went and got a beamer
Her mom call me a D-boy
She said yes he is a dreamer
Two tickets to the matinee
Me and shorty way back in the day
Now she's into films
Our thing just starts to dim (ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)

[Interlude: Rick Ross talking]
You know when you dealing with a bad boy baby
I got to keep it triller
Even if it hurt, you know

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I won't sing to you like Chris and Ne-Yo
But I'm fresher than a stick of deo
Take you to a place where the chef is Creole
Black beach right next to Rio
Running out the house just to flip the
Dice in my pocket I'm with the c-lo
Pull up to the crib and I hit dawn
Beep beep
Rick Dinero Boss
And I quip the lado (what)
That's right let me flip the car doe
In the wind, might hit Chicago
She might pick the cargo (yea)
Let's skip Apollo
Carlos Brados (uh)
My Picasso (what)
We ride or die (die)
She my little vato

[Verse 2: Aubrey & Aundrea]
Can't hold it back
You know I'm so addicted to you
Cravings attack
Whenever I get closer to you
I'm in withdrawl
Whenever you're away
I just want you here with me boy
Let's take a ride
I'll show you all the avenues
Hop in my coupe
I only got a room for two
Let's just explore
My only destination is you
I'll tell you what I want to do
Baby

[Pre-Hook: Dawn]
Can I take you to a place
Where we can go far away
Let's take a chance tonight

[Verse 3: Shannon & D. Woods]
The mood is set
My temperature is rising
I'm getting hot
And there ain't no denying (ah)
I know a spot
Where can just go get lost together
Right now I'll do whatever
You take me high
But I really want to go off (off)
Hearts beating fast
Temp is still moving (slow)
My fantasy
And boy just take control
Come on won't you let me know

Boy you got me twisted

I can't get you off my senses
You make me feel brand new
