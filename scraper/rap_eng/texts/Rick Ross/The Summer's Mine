[Intro: Sample]
Just when I thought I was out..they pull me back in

[Hook: Rick Ross]
The summer's mine
The summer's mine
I'm buying ten bottles bitch and I'm on number nine
The summer's mine
The summer's mine
Everytime she see a new whip she know it's one of mine

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
The summer's mine, new silver Scaglietti
Vacheron Don you niggas ain't ready
You niggas is petty, you niggas spaghetti
Bustin' yo meatball, nigga you better be ready
You niggas pathetic, leave you paraplegic
You throwin' up sets but you really from Cleveland
Fuck boi, Fuck boi, Fuck boi, FUCK BOI!!!
See I broke it down like a quarter ki
Bitch I run the south, I'm what you wanna be
This how you wanna live, this what you wanna drive
Be honest with yourself I'm who you idolize

[Hook: Rick Ross]
The summer's mine
The summer's mine
I'm buying ten bottles bitch and I'm on number nine
The summer's mine
The summer's mine
Everytime she see a new whip she know it's one of mine
The summer's mine
The summer's mine
Everytime you look around they spinning one of mine
The summer's mine
The summer's mine
The last motherfucker that you want to undermine

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
These motherfuckers mad that I'm icey
Talking to a pussy nigga yeah I might be
Let it resonate, first forty eight
Home of the choppa totters, my paper straight
I assassinate and employ them all
Shitting on ya dogs I'm just showing off
Self made, you just affiliated
Really a water-boy, nigga you entertainment
Blowin money fast, yellow Maserati
Deadman walking, decomposing body
I'm living large, this nigga been a mark
They used his credit cards just to get they rental cars

[Hook: Rick Ross]
