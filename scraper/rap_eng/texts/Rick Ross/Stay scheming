[Mackgee – Intro ]

Dawg!
Uh
Slide for my n******!

[Mackgee – Verse One]

Stay Scheming, raise demons
All you haters f**k yourselves face to face penis
Can’t do it like I do it they just stay dreaming
I’m the truest if it’s music, on the stage screaming
Back to back a couple Jordans like I made millions
Just some thousand dollars
Regular whip!
Got some mileage
Trying to plot on me, they treat me like a graph book
Barack Obama or depict me as a mad Bush
‘cause I’m ruling this
My music now got mega downloads, so you could say I’m doing swizz
Quick to holla if she look like Alicia Keys
A couple chains on me, looking like I’m Mister T
I got them thangs! on me, looking like I’m with police
But I’m not with the law; I don’t roll with the badges
I rep the green white green, now you know what the flag is
Polo beneath my jeans, it will show when I sag it
Trying to play me for a joke, all these n***** clueless
I make the desert storm; it’s nothing like fabolous music
What ’re you scheming for? I don’t see your reason
You claim you’re shooting like you’re Kobe I don’t see your season

[Mackgee - HOOK] X 2
Slide for my Ni***Z dawg!, ride for my Ni***z Uh!

[Mackgee – Verse two]

I’ve been trying all my life to fight my stomach growlings
My Pops told me that to be a man takes more than violence
I’m just trying to get a nut, like a couple almonds
My real ni***z stacking up, labor for allowance
But I’m kind ‘a imbalanced, when my paper’s deficit
Searching for a hustle, like another way to get at it
Tried to make a video, was looking for a camera guy
Took my money from me, left me nothing I was traumatized
F**k Jordan tower films, a couple bullets shower him, (fuck y’all ni***z)
A couple bullets shower him
F**k Jordan tower films, a couple bullets shower him…him
Couple bullets shower him!
