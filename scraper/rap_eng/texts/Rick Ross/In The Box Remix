Can you compare money, nah not really doe
Yeah you want my Shawty, can't can't get her doe
Brag about how big your house is, patio
Ask your girl what we did? We just smashed on the radio

She like to call me baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby when I got her in the box
She like to wrap her legs, her legs, her legs, her legs
Her legs around my neck and keep them locked
She like to call me baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby when I got her in the box
She like to to wrap her legs, her legs, her legs, her legs
Her Legs around my neck and keep them locked

First stop king of diamonds, hope them bitches ready
Yup, I pulled up in that no top, gave them all a headache
Told the girl I need them racks on racks and
Damn it I need that in a hurry
Shawty flirting while she workin tryna (convince me to get) behind them curtains
She said the word is that I make that paper fly like Michael Jordan

I'm a custom decustom
Custom that custom, ....my whip like my sneakers
Once I ... it's nothing

She resembles a model, sexy and slender as tower

I just set you on fire, sweating your name and your number
She got a mean ..., I let my ... talk
...how sweet, jack in the bee..
That's why she's a damn piece, nothing but Vicky zone
2 ... rings, treating like a leaky bonds
Might blow a hundred racks for ... 200 thound
Put you on your feet to barely just to roll around
Members only, I'm talking bawler status
No ...numbers cribs in that land of the dallas
Back to the 3 o 5 kiss is staring in my eyes
It's time to tape my name inside you and a thigh

She like to call me baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby when I got her in the box

She no scream my name unless I hurt her
Get from my ... never
But in the box she call me murder
I like to call her Jackie O, presidential homie
Anything that I gotta get done, she get down and do it for me
Ain't gotta never worry about shootin off cause she gonna shoot it for me
Actin like she own me

She like to call me baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby when I got her in the box
She like to ... a laser on my neck and keep them locked
