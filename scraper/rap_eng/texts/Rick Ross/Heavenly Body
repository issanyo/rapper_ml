[Intro: Lloyd & Rick Ross]
Your heavenly body
Lets get it
I'm the man, I'm the man, cellphone jumping
And I'm thumbing through a hunnid grand (Hustling)
Your heavenly body

[Verse 1: Lloyd]
Every time you come around (yeah, yeah)
My heart drops to the ground (ground, ground)
You bring the summer to the winter
You turn a saint to a sinner
You know, you know, you know ya got that good (na-na)
The kind you only find in the hood
Like one of them Caddies with the leather and the wood (wood)
You the one I hit, one I hit when I need the good shit (good shit)
Fine as the DOA, not even the king of diamonds
Ain't nothing on you baby

[Hook: Lloyd]
I almost died last night
When you took off your clothes
My heart just stopped (my heart)
Your heavenly body
And when we start off, won't stop
It's like I live in you, girl you're so soft
Your heavenly body

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
You're a 10 with your clothes on (yeah, yeah)
You have the chart with your clothes off (yeah, yeah)
Can't wait to get you to the crib
So I can break it off
You need a real man, you don't need no buster
I can tell you left your last one, cause he was a sucker
I'm just here to please you, I don't wanna hurt ya (girl)

[Hook: Lloyd]
I almost died last night (almost died last night)
When you took off your clothes
My heart just stopped (my heart)
Your heavenly body
And when we start off, won't stop
It's like I live in you, girl you're so soft
Your heavenly body

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Took you out the ghetto
Got you sleeping on the beach
Love the hood but gotta keep you out these sucker reach
Pledge allegiance to the hustle, she know I'm so sincere
Ceremony celebrating our last several years
Hugs and kisses, Moschino that Goyard on my Mrs
Club money, C-notes that's coming for attention
I'm the man, I'm the man, cellphone jumping
And I'm thumbing through a hunnid grand (Hustling)
We the richest in the city
Fighting fire cases Mayweather in the building
Chicks show me love but you're the only one I crave
Since back in the day before Lloyd grew out his braids

[Hook: Lloyd]
I almost died last night (almost died last night)
When you took off your clothes
My heart just stopped (my heart)
Your heavenly body
And when we start off, won't stop (baby, I won't stop)
It's like I live in you, girl you're so soft (so soft)
Your heavenly body (body baby)

[Outro: Lloyd]
Put your hands up if you down
I just wanna I just wanna lay you down
Put your hands up if you down
I just wanna I just wanna lay you down
