[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming
And I come running
Cause I'm your dog
Baby I'm your dog
So whenever you call
I come running
Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming
And I come running
Cause I'm your dog
Baby I'm your dog
So whenever you call
I come running

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
He ain't listenin'
So you can talk to me, don't listen to him
A body like that ain't hard to feed, cause girl I'll eat you up
All in a couple of seconds, girl I'll eat you up
It's when you realize you're in Heaven like how'd you get there?
Baby what you doin' in this chair? Couldn't let you sit there
You need help, somebody should get there
You see girl, time is like money, both of which men loathe
Spend them both with me and then for sure you'll know

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming
And I come running
Cause I'm your dog
Baby I'm your dog
So whenever you call
I come running
Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming
And I come running
Cause I'm your dog
Baby I'm your dog
So whenever you call
I come running

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
She's impressed by a fat boy
Cadillac, weed, pistol on his lap, boy
Home run hitter, thought I was a batboy
Search warrant for the crib, you better get a map for it
Paid for, meanin' I ain't gotta rap for it
She a alley oop, I tap it off the backboard
Hustlin', baby what you lookin' for? Just ask for it
Blue Ferrari, I'm the envy of the task force
Impeccable suits, as I run with my dogs
Pinkie rings and things that come with my wonderful job
Dogg pound niggas, and we came to fight
I was several million up before it came to light
Now they callin' me the truest one to ever do it
Status symbol for the pimps, now enjoy the music
Smoked out like a player and you know the name
Break a bitch quick, really, biggest in the game

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming
And I come running
Cause I'm your dog
Baby I'm your dog
So whenever you call
I come running
Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming
And I come running
Cause I'm your dog
Baby I'm your dog
So whenever you call
I come running

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I got... Rottweiler in tube sock
Pitbull... lock on your neck, kiss it and you'll die
Boxer... you take mine's off then hallelujah
Shando, count my blessings, spin around two times
Freaky... freak like it's the 80s
Fuckin' explicit, radio prolly say we
Should tone it... down with the clean version
Dirty... but in public you're like teen virgin
I like it... make me realize my vices
Enticin', flower bombin' all on your privates
Private... meetin' inside your bedroom
Head in that Maybach boomin', thank God for leg room
It's a trophy in that pussy, I'mma cum in first place
I'mma cum in first place, cum in, cum in first place
I'm your D-O-double-G and I need more Pedigree
What it D-O? Puppy chow, I've been grown and so off the leash, ho

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming
And I come running
Cause I'm your dog
Baby I'm your dog
So whenever you call
I come running
Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming
And I come running
Cause I'm your dog
Baby I'm your dog
So whenever you call
I come running
