[Verse 1: Bruno Mali]
Once I'm on they ass now, I picked up that poetry
Remaster my old flows, let me bust this door key
Monkey on my back, I ain't no killa but they temptin' me
Ask me how I feel, nigga, fuck you with parenthesis
He told me never to let these bustas beat me mentally
I stay on my gangsta, guess I get whatever meant for me
Pop a gunshot, ring out, nigga, it sound like a symphony
Hit your block and tear it up, game ain't built no sympathy, uh
Ay lil nigga get your bread, don’t fall in love with bitches
Real niggas go to court and fuck with double digits
If we out park 'cross the street with all these fuckin' pictures
64 with all these fuckin' switchers
I bet they profile ya, they pulled you over, police fuckin' with you
Give it to 'em at the streets, say they fuckin' missed 'em
We body Benzes for my bitch and my fuckin' sister
Screamin', "Block money," then it's fuck the system
In my city when you hot, gotta keep a fuckin' pistol
Homebase pussy niggas hatin' from a distance
Block stars, every nigga bangin', been official
I'm 'bout to blow up on 'em like a pistol

[Hook: Bruno Mali]
'Bout to jump out in that monkey suit, that monkey suit
Act bananas, that what monkeys do, what monkeys do
You get stupid, we get funky too, get funky too
'Bout to jump out in that monkey suit, that monkey suit
Nigga, pull up in that black van, nigga, I ain't lyin'
Jump out in that monkey suit, nigga, I ain't lyin'
I pull up in that black van, nigga, I ain't lyin'
Jump out in that monkey suit, nigga, I ain't lyin'
'Bout to jump out in that monkey suit, that monkey suit
Act bananas, that what monkeys do, what monkeys do
You get stupid, we get funky too, get funky too
'Bout to jump out in that monkey suit, that monkey suit

[Verse 2: Bruno Mali]
Ayy, two page letter off the dome like
Hey there Mr. President
Police strapped up in my hood killin' all the residents
Backed ‘em up from out my hood cause they flags confederate
First they give it to us, then they lock up us for selling it
You say we equal, that's an insult to my intelligence
Mama raised her kids up while papa locked up in the cell again
They take fathers out the house and stop proper development
(They take fathers out the house and stop proper development)
Fuck you, why you yellin'? This that slave ship, niggas sellin' it
Crooked crook could show you where the felon is, roll up, we in heaven
Young black kings, just look at my melanin
Can't get no jobs 'cause I got too much felonies

[Hook: Bruno Mali]
'Bout to jump out in that monkey suit, that monkey suit
Act bananas, that what monkeys do, what monkeys do
You get stupid, we get funky too, get funky too
'Bout to jump out in that monkey suit, that monkey suit
Nigga, pull up in that black van, nigga, I ain't lyin'
Jump out in that monkey suit, nigga, I ain't lyin'
I pull up in that black van, nigga, I ain't lyin'
Jump out in that monkey suit, nigga, I ain't lyin'
'Bout to jump out in that monkey suit, that monkey suit
Act bananas, that what monkeys do, what monkeys do
You get stupid, we get funky too, get funky too
'Bout to jump out in that monkey suit, that monkey suit

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I be talkin' more money than these niggas used to
Heron on the block, jump out, call my niggas juice crew
Hit 'em up on 17, let me out on duce duce
Walk up on the devil inside and knock his tooth loose
Used to run it in the flea market for silk shirts
Somehow I'm the one that always hit the lick first
Hit a nigga for me, you be reimbursed
And it's vice versa if I see him first
Bookin' bitches, the baddest ones get in my memoir
Still out on bond, in 90 days, I bought 10 cars
Fuck who hatin' if it's a war, well they can get involved
Bought a mansion out on the water, money in the walls, boss

[Hook: Bruno Mali]
'Bout to jump out in that monkey suit, that monkey suit
Act bananas, that what monkeys do, what monkeys do
You get stupid, we get funky too, get funky too
'Bout to jump out in that monkey suit, that monkey suit
Nigga, pull up in that black van, nigga, I ain't lyin'
Jump out in that monkey suit, nigga, I ain't lyin'
I pull up in that black van, nigga, I ain't lyin'
Jump out in that monkey suit, nigga, I ain't lyin'
'Bout to jump out in that monkey suit, that monkey suit
Act bananas, that what monkeys do, what monkeys do
You get stupid, we get funky too, get funky too
'Bout to jump out in that monkey suit, that monkey suit
