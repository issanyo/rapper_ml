[Intro: Mario & Rick Ross]
Uh, Uh
Yeah, it's fly
It's Rick Ross
It's that L.A. Reid flow right here
Mario Winans
Holla, hold up

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Sometimes I rhyme slow
Sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I buy blow
So I supply bricks (Ross)
Motherfuckers lookin' at me sideways
But can they tell I'm gettin' money five ways
Lot of leather, wood and the seats vibrate
Chattin' with a bitch like your boy on MySpace
But she right here in my face
Take her to a fly place, with a fly fireplace
No marshmallows, we let the dro burn
I done seen the world, girl it's your turn
I told you lies all my life
But you hold me down, wrong or right
So it's only right she get that Porsche truck
All black black rims, call her Porscha
Let your weave blow in the wind
Cause believe ever D-boy need a friend

[Hook: Mario Winans]
When can we, get away and enjoy each other?
Get away and explore each other?
All I wanna know is
When can we, get away and exchange our feelings
Keep it poppin' like a move screenin'
I only wanna get away

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm in heavy dough, I don't kiss every hoe
So when I like a bitch, I enlist Mario
Feed her Larry-O's, sip Everglo
With Gloria Estefan and Emillio
Baby really though, this your best bet (Ross)
It will be six O's in my next check (Ross)
With a gun in hand, I've also been a money man
Crack runnin' man, fat Randall Cunningham
Look here, I'mma tell you like this
We need time to just kick it like this
She lickin' my lips, she diggin' my kicks
So we did it like this
It's Rick Ross, I'm the man of the hour
She love to make love, and we can in the shower
Back against the wall, I'mma stand like a tower
Every time I'mma stand like a tower

[Hook: Mario Winans]
When can we, get away and enjoy each other?
Get away and explore each other?
All I wanna know is
When can we, get away and exchange our feelings
Keep it poppin' like a move screenin'
I only wanna get away

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Sometimes I rhyme slow
Sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I buy blow
So I supply bricks (Ross)
You can't look me in the face
When you wrong, I'mma put you in your place
My money long, I got money just to waste, girl
My money home, and it's up to my waist, girl
I really love how you shake girl
You like a Phantom, I love how you shake girl
Rick Ross, I'm a real nigga
You can feel the realness when I deal with ya
Baby I won't lie to ya
I'm too honest, I promise I won't lie to ya
That other bitch finished with
You the one I'm havin' dinner with
And it's candlelit
Can you handle it?
Cause I can handle it
Well, lets handle this

[Hook: Mario Winans]
When can we, get away and enjoy each other?
Get away and explore each other?
All I wanna know is
When can we, get away and exchange our feelings
Keep it poppin' like a move screenin'
I only wanna get away

[Bridge: Mario Winans]
When can we
Oh, you don't have to be alone, no not anymore
Baby when can we
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go baby
All you have to do is say yes to me
Say yes to me, oh
Say Yes to me baby
Say yes to me girl
Say yes to me, oh
Say yes to me baby
Say yes to me girl
And I'll do anything, anything for you
