[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Gotta let it breathe
Put the weed out
Double M
Niggas' get it and they fall off
It's cause they all soft
Nigga like me started at the car wash
8am to 10pm, that's on the rainy day
Wise words from dope boys meant everything
They say it's levels to the street life
Then I seen a bezel with that pink ice
All natural, momma tell you to be careful
In the trap trapping to increase capital
No longer cruising with the windows down
Hand on the pistol anticipating the riddle sound
I'm Kanye when it came to yay
I'm Jay-Z when it came to keys
I'm Snoop when it came to weed
So now they wanna Biggie me
As the credit rolls, now the charge is federal
Money bags, I'm placed upon a pedestal
Still on the block in my Reeboks
You ain't even know these was the Basquiat's
You ain't really know who really call shots
Worldwide mastermind, number one all charts

[Verse 2: Skyy Frost]
Last time I checked, I only had three choices
In the hood, locked up, or in a casket full of roses
No way to make it out
Seen a few go the college route
But the bills start piling, and they always end up dropping out
Lets just say, Imma different breed
Only mission to succeed
Never stood on the corner slanging keys
I had dreams of making it big and never lost hope
I knew I could still reach success without selling dope
Appreciate the opportunities y’all take for granted
All the times y’all don’t feel like working, I’m taking advantage
Making sure I’ll never end up stranded, empty-handed
Only focused on money.  To me it’s so romantic
They used to laugh when I had three jobs at 18
Act like I was crazy; only focus was making green
Now I can hold our whole class reunion at my house
Laugh now.  Word to Ross.  Feel like the biggest boss

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Watch us ball
Stop a star, nigga not at all
I'm poppin' broads with Tiny Hog at the shoppin' mall
All money in the squad, boy I'm not involved
Can't pay the cost to floss? I can spot your flaws
SLs with the toppin' off
Dress well when it's time to ball
Couple hundred for my boxer drawers
Young nigga used to shop at Ross
First to shoot when it's poppin' off
Couple times, a nigga almost got popped by Ross
Crash unit, buzz cut, ex-marines
Crenshaw, Slauson Ave 17
Infant Stone, Lil' Shady, Baby Buke to fast light a demonstration
85 Cutlass with the 380s
Summertime functions, L.A. streets' crazy
Shoot it out' that's what this crew about
Hangin' out the Cutlass window with the Rugar out
Prove yourself, killers in pursuit of clout
It felt wrong, but who is you to doubt
Look, my master plan was buy a pound and then move it south
And hopefully one day I'll put this music out
Trippin' now, seeing that it's moving out
I'm buying spots, nigga moving out
My fan base, I see 'em moving south
I'm overseas eating fucking croûte
Yeah. So I can tell you what this hustling 'bout
I couldn't tell you what no luck about
I had maps on my wall, nigga
Dope sacks in my drawers, nigga
Look, a lot of stress I couldn't rest not at all
Nigga risking everything trynna ball
