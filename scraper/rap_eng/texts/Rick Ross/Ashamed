[Intro]
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, what you've done
Welcome to the home of the brave (Maybach Music)
Rozay ugh
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, I am shameless, what you've done
So self made
I can still count a mill' without a money machine nigga

[Verse 1]
Got on my darkest shades, this man is made
Inherit no riches, Jehovah's my witness
Physical fitness, home economics
In the kitchen digital scales producin' the product
Cut the noose off my neck, black runaway slave
In the coupe with the Tec, it's the home of the brave
They wanna know names, they totin' on thangs
Never wanted the fame, just wanted a Range
I needed some change, mama needed a raise
She stayed in a rage, hated minimum wage
I'm feelin' the same, all these criminals paid
Wearing Bally's and gold, I'm sellin' dope shameless to say
And maybe one day I could put this pain away
Until then I'mma be a d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be a d-boy, I'm ashamed to say

[Hook]
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, what you've done
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, I am shameless, what you've done
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say

[Verse 2]
Before I was a fetus, had the genes of a leader
I mean look at my features, educated my teachers
I was callin' them plays, you were still in the bleaches
Boobie gave me the game, change to give me some sneakers
Now I'm roamin' the block, car missin' the top
Meanin' missin' a roof, hope you listenin' y'all
I was dealt a few blows, I felt a few lows
Even shed a few tears, I traveled that road
Went from walkin' on gravel, now I'm ridin' on vogues
50M's in the bank, I get me 200, I'm gone
Still so close to the hood, I'm ashamed to say
All the money in the world can't take this pain away
It's just another story at the campfire
Court side seats with the franchise
I think about my niggas doin' 25
Shinin' bright, who am I for you to criticize?

[Hook]
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, what you've done
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, I am shameless, what you've done
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say

[Verse 3]
I'm smokin' psychedelics, I hustle like a felon
Hottest record label, but still in all I'm chillin'
Not a crack in my voice, this young nigga so poised
First I stack some money, then go to war with them boys
Anybody can get it, hand his mammy some tissue
Better ring the alarm, cause we bringin' them pistols
Have them singin' them songs, speakin' on sensitive issues
These emotional niggas, and most of them killas
They movin' in silence, but they follow your Twitters
These the games that they play, they study your Instagram pictures
See I live by the code that the mafia wrote
When he ran his mouth, me I'd rather smoke
I'd rather listen, he had to ask permission
I had to make a way, I had to act commission
Until this day I'm slain, the commission remains
Net worth over a billion, I'm ashamed to say

[Hook]
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, what you've done
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, I am shameless, what you've done
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
