[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
My paint wet, my bitch bad
Straight mastermind, yo' rich ass
My cup full, full of that pink shit
So shut your fuckin' mouth, fuck all that weak shit
This Double M-G shit, Double M-G shit
She fuck my whole squad, she Double M-G bitch
Just got that G-Wagon, I'm just so innovative
We came for the money bags, so fuck your invitations
This calls for a celebration, Bel-Air celebration
60 hoes in the basement, nigga covered all the bases
Jabbar gave me a quarter, I sold it on the 1st
I took it to my mama, "here go get what you deserve"
Mob ties, Genovese
Money trains, centerpiece
We started at the bottom, until I got a bird
I pull that pussy card, that was all ya heard
Haan, haan, haan

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & (Rick Ross)]
My whole life been based on that pimp shit (haan)
No movie, just money, real pimp shit (haan)
More cities, more bitches, real slick shit (haan)
My Maybach, it matches my outfit, that pimp shit

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Keepin' my tool, this shit so cool
Rule number one, ain't no rule
Swallow my lines, follow my grind
Rich white bitch with a bottle of wine
Word to the wise, word to mine
Bird a fly, certified
Murder eye, dirty die
Never had black but she heard of my
D-O-dub, I done it all
20 years I bang a ball
'91 I had a Lexus nigga
Ate seafood for breakfast nigga
Caught a few cases in Texas nigga
Do kushups 'til my chest get bigger
I press a nigga 'til I get it all
Real shit bitch I really do ball
I am the west to y'all
Taught y'all how to invest in ball
Best of all, took it on a chest for y'all
That's why I get more than the rest of y'all
It's bad enough I entertain
Add it up, gang bang
Gat 'em up, slang cane
Bag it up, same thang

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Haan
My whole life been based on that pimp shit (haan)
No movie, just money, real pimp shit (haan)
More cities, more bitches, real slick shit
My Maybach, it matches my outfit, that pimp shit

[Outro: Snoop Dogg & (Rick Ross)]
Titty one, titty two (haan)
See these are essentials, essentially speakin quintessentials (haan)
I bang it all, I dust it all, I smoke with all my dawgs
I bang it all, I dust it all, I smoke with all my dawgs
(My paint wet, my feet chrome
Fuck boys hate, but they sing along
The real niggas admire, success makes you inspire
Nigga came from the jets, I just hired a pilot
Bitches feeding me fruit)
