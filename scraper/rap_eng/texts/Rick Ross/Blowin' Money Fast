I think I'm Big Meech Larry Hoover, whipping work, hallelujah, one nation under god real niggas getting money from the fucking start
My rolls Royce triple black

Balling in the club, bottles like I'm miche hoe
Ross that's my nickname
Cocaine running in my big vain
Self made,you just affiliate
I build the ground up, u bought it renovated
Talking plenty capers nothings been authenticated
Funny you claiming the same bitch that I'm penetrating
Hold the bottles up where my comrades
Where the fucking felons, where my dawns at
I got that Archie Bunker and it's so white III
Jussssst might charge u double
