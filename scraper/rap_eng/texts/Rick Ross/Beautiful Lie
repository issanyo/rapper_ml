[Intro: Rick Ross]
Uh, love that smoke and that fellatio
Ah, she make my dreams come true
Shawty make my dreams come true

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I seen her in the pretty car
I seen her pretty ponytail
When she pulled up to the crib
I seen her pretty pair of heels
So I hit her with my street game
No, I never ever say my name
I did hit her with the phone number
But looking in her eyes, recognize when I run up on you
Pull her shirt, once again, shawty with this work
I'm a different type of nigga coming from the dirt
Big truck, bruised up, sucking on her neck
Need a nigga to invest so I wrote a cheque
My dick rock hard baby seeing your success
Freaky nigga pull a yacht, fucking on the deck
She said I ate her pussy,  if I did then I forgot

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Or was it a beautiful lie?
Or was it a beautiful lie?
Or was it a beautiful lie?
Or was it a beautiful lie?
If I ate her pussy then I forgot
She told me a beautiful lie
Shawty told me a beautiful lie
Shawty told me a beautiful lie
And that's something she'd do a lot

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Shawty told me she was 22
I'm the perfect type of nigga just to run into
305, chillin' for a month or two
Five star condo to feel comfortable
Collins Ave, lookin' like the old Birdman
Or out in Durban, nigga let your fur hang
Bird gang, saw 20 of 'em eryday
Took her shopping she was slacking on her purse game
Blowing 20 then I'm out
Not outta money just let the driver know when to bounce
Stop by Tootsies for the crab cakes
Lap dance by a bitch who still on back page
Walking through the door and everybody know her name
Dirty game, baby girl, a familiar face
She say the way I make her feel, she wanna change her life

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Or is it a beautiful lie
She told me a beautiful lie
She told me a beautiful lie
She told me a beautiful lie
Nigga name in the sky till the day I die

[Bridge: [?]]
You don't gotta lie no more
Beautiful lie
Beautiful lie
Beautiful lie
Beautiful lie
Beautiful lie
Beautiful lie
You don't believe yourself, I know that
You don't believe yourself
Beautiful lie, lie
Beautiful lie
(We believe in what we wanna believe)
You ain't gotta lie no more
You ain't gotta lie
(Lexicon legend, Ralph)

[Verse 3: Wale]
Kick game, ain't the same, what's your name baby?
Do me a favor, get your legs out the way and uh
I'm getting chains but I do not change
Or I got them whips, chains, everything Christ' Grey baby
Fifty shades of black, white and one night
Put an arch in your back, I'm running in your life, right
When your man don't be right
Why have a Coke can, when you can have some Dom P right?
Yeah, it's only right, double M is intact
No hyperbole either, it's gonna hurt when I'm working those thighs
Scream like you thinking I'm doing permanent damage
And I leave it, you breathin' like you was running some track
Breath, breath... something to catch
Kitten catch tongue, while you cum you catching a cramp
Catch Z's, catch O's, catch 'em again
Then I wake up in the morning like fuck am I at?
Huh? Where the fuck am I at?
Hey, yeah, where the fuck am I at?
What the fuck did we do?
Shoulda tell your friend to come through
Mmm, where the fuck am I at?
Where the fuck am I at?
What the fuck did we do?

[Bridge: [?] & Wale]
You ain't gotta lie no more
Beautiful lie
Beautiful lie
Beautiful lie
(Beautiful lies to me)
Beautiful lie
(Beautiful lies to me)
It's alright, beautiful lies to me
Beautiful lies to me, to me, to me
You ain't gotta lie no more
Beautiful lie
Beautiful lie
Beautiful lie
Beautiful lie
Beautiful lie
Beautiful lie
