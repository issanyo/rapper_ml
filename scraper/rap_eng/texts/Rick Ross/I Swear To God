[Intro]
Watch the real niggas celebrate
All the real niggas selling weight
Watch the real niggas celebrate

[Hook]
I swear to God, that's on my kids
Every day that I'm alive, I gotta live
For every gangster ever died or did a bid
Where I'm from, when niggas ride, they killin' quick
Flipping bricks, counting money -- so repetitious
Highly decorated gangster, so keep a distance
Swear to God, that's on my kids, better mind your business
Five grand'll get you killed, what's a life sentence?
Life sentence, huh!

[Verse 1]
I'm paranoid cause I'm in the Porsche
In the projects, sitting on a brick of boy
I swear to God, this dick could change your life
So grab your bags, it's time to catch a flight
I levitate on all these pussy niggas
I never hate on all these pussy niggas
My tax bracket on some other shit
I could put you on that mothership

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Start winning, niggas wanna whisper in the dark
Spray the driver's side window when the Lincoln park
I think these niggas out here reading lips
Salty, we the only niggas eating chips
Gotta separate from all these pussy niggas
You could never hesitate and you's a pussy, nigga
We started off dead broke
Now I got forty million in a fucking yoke
I got four million in my boat
All jokes aside, a few million in my ho
Double M, know the G's, nigga
Or Colombians, sipping mojitos with leaves, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Rose-gold Jesus, rose-gold watch
All-black Ghost, all-black Glock
Three new flows, that's off top
All white squares, the city on lock
I swear to God, I need a hundred m's
'Til the day I die, I plan to represent
Hold your heads high, we had a nice run
Let the bankers know we have just begun
I broke the mold; my total assets
Will get you assholes left in the past tense
I broke the mold in every aspect
I'll get you assholes left in the past tense

[Hook]
