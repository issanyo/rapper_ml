[Intro: Rick Ross]
We finna make history

Fifty million later, ya hear me?
Whoa
Maybach Music

[Verse 1: Rick Ross & Lil Pump]
All the hoes wanna suck dick
All the hoes wanna fuck me
All the niggas wanna hate, though
Get whacked in the front seat
FaceTime when she topless
Can't post all the choppas
Dade County where I came from
No room for imposters
Cocaine on the stovetop
Yayo up, won't lie
Fast break like a b-ball
Bullet hole like a Donut
Bel-Air for the new crib
Bel-Air for the black bottom
Bel-Air my new old school
Gettin' out like I'm John Gotti
Fuck nigga don't want none
Goin' bad like I'm on somethin'
50 grand for the new watch
Rob me and I won't run
Window on the photo
Call her up on the polo
Everybody still gang-gang but your ass die solo
Everybody die solo, everybody die solo
Everybody die solo, everybody die solo
(Bang)
Lil Pump, ooh, aye

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Spent twenty racks on a pinky ring (ooh)
Walk in the club with a diamond chain (brr)
Spent twenty racks on a pinky ring
Walk in the club with a diamond chain (what)
Pinky ring, pinky ring, pinky ring (pinky ring)
Pinky ring, pinky ring (ooh)
Pinky ring, pinky ring, pinky ring (pinky ring)
Pinky ring, pinky ring (ooh)

[Verse 2: Lil Pump]
I fuck your bitch in some Gucci loafers (brr)
I bust a nut in her Louis sofa (Louis)
VVS all on my diamond choker (ooh)
I crashed the Porsche and I crashed the Rover (brr)
I told my mama I'm sorry, ooh
I think I just popped a Molly, yeah
I think I'm whippin' up Whitney (huh, huh, huh)
I'm whippin' up Whitney, I turn into Scotty, ooh
Lil Pump in Maserati, ooh
Lil Pump ain't got no license, yeah
I fuck a bitch, I ain't wifin', ooh
Bite a bitch ear like Mike Tyson, yeah

[Verse 3: SmokePurpp]
Hoe, I got lean in my backpack (backpack)
MAC-11 turned to a Big Mac (blat, blat, blat)
Niggas gettin' pulled like a thumb tack (woo)
Let me get the pen, hit a Chase bank (Chase bank)
Niggas want beef, we got that
And I got water on me like Flapjack (water, water, water)
Came in the club with a big rack
Bitch, Iâ€™m off the lean and I'm doin' up the zig-zags (skrr, skrr, skrr)
Pinky ring, diamond ring
Fuck up the pot with like ten chains (skrr, skrr, skrr)
Hood rich, bitch, I don't need fame (what)
Pull up on your bitch in an airplane (skrr)
I just got brand new shoes (ooh)
All day zap up, crash the coupe (god damn)
And I brought a dog in the club, too (majestic)
Everything I buy, I gotta buy two

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Spent twenty racks on a pinky ring (ooh)
Walk in the club with a diamond chain (brr)
Spent twenty racks on a pinky ring
Walk in the club with a diamond chain (what)
Pinky ring, pinky ring, pinky ring (pinky ring)
Pinky ring, pinky ring (ooh)
Pinky ring, pinky ring, pinky ring (pinky ring)
Pinky ring, pinky ring (ooh)

[Outro: Lil Pump]
Spent twenty racks on a pinky ring
Walk in the club with a diamond chain
Spent twenty racks on a pinky ring
Walk in the club with a diamond chain
Pinky ring, pinky ring, pinky ring
Pinky ring, pinky ring
Pinky ring, pinky ring, pinky ring
Pinky ring, pinky ring
