I grew up with the killers and the robbers niggas
They'd strip you out that bomb and ain't no robbers nigga
Not the type they entertain what you pussies tweet
Cause I could pop you with 'em things, see you in the street
I'm really ready to wide and wreck the father rules
Show you how I divide up all the work and move
So now you understand why these niggas hate

Been in this bitch so long, I watch the beaker break
I talk dope cause it's universal
You and all black slide nigga, you a lurk
