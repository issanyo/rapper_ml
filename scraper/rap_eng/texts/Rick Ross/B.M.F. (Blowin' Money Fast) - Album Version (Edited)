I think I'm big meech Larry Hoover
Whipping work, halleluiah
One nation under god real niggas getting money from the fucking start
I think I'm big meech Larry Hoover
Whipping work, hallelujah
One nation under god real niggas getting money from the fucking start

My Rolls Royce triple black
I'm iche hoe
Balling in the club, bottles like I'm miche hoe
Rozay, that's my nickname
Cocaine running in my big vain
Self made you just affiliate
I built it ground up, you bought it renovated
Talking plenty capers nothings been authenticated
Funny you claiming the same bitch that I'm penetrating
Hold the bottles up where my comrades
Where the fuck you felons, where my dogs at
I got that entrebunker and it's so white
I just might charge you double

I think I'm big meech Larry Hoover
Getting work, halleluiah
One nation under god real niggas getting money from the fucking start
I think I'm big meech Larry Hoover
Getting work, hallelujah
One nation under god real niggas getting money from the fucking start

These mother fuckers mad that I'm icey
Stunt so hard make them come and indite me
I think I'm big meech look at my time peace
It anodomere hundred wrecks at least
Look at yourself now look at me
You can't see a nigga I'm what you you use to be
Look at it this way you niggas side ways
Always getting money my nigga crime pays
So fuck a nigga I'm self made
You a sucka nigga I'm self paid
This for my broke niggas
This for my rich niggas
Got a hundred on a head of a snitch nigga

I think I'm big meech Larry Hoover
Whipping work, hallelujah
One nation under god real niggas getting money from the fucking start
I think I'm big meech Larry Hoover
Whipping work, hallelujah
One nation under god real niggas getting money from the fucking start
