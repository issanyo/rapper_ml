[Intro: Barry White]
It feels so good
You lying here next to me
Oh

[Verse One: Rick Ross]
I'm living underneath the telescope
Ciroc in my margarita in Mexico
Got a model with me that I seen on World Star
Introduced her to the world of La Pearla
I'm talking S and M but got her screaming A to Z
Talking the type of cheese she used to think was make believe
I used to fuck 'em then I made 'em leave
Leaving things, I had a bucket full of Maybeline
I had a bucket of my favorite green
Opened up the budget now it's only major things
Mulsanne, run ya half a ticket
Bugatti Boys, cop won't even write the ticket
I got a few crips that wanna come and kick it
Catch blue balls if one of ya nigga's bitches
I know the feeling gotta re-align your wills to life
Or better yet, maybe should write your will tonight

[Hook: Barry White & (Rick Ross)]
Deeper and deeper
In love with you I'm falling
Sweeter and sweeter
Your tender words of love keep calling (Money grew like grass)
Eager and eager (Money grew like grass)
To feel your sweet lips on my face (Money grew like grass)
Please her and please her
Any time or any place

[Verse Two: Rick Ross]
Got on my Vacheron, I'm paid in full
Lining up all my niggas 'bout to pull some major moves
Consolidate the game and suffocate the others
Keep it real with your niggas and multiply the numbers
Go to trial and never take the stand
Every bitch was born to break a man
I take you deeper than them other dudes
I see my niggas scramble chickens by the twos
He talking like a ho and valeting the Benz
She acting like a bitch while I'm takin' her friend
Ran outta 1's now I'm throwing what I got
I took her home, time to show her what I got
I took her tongue and took it to another notch
I'm getting funds time to get another watch
I'm having fun fucking let my brother watch
I got thirty cars and headed to another lot

(M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music)

Money grew like grass
Money grew like grass
Money grew like grass

[Hook: Barry White & (Rick Ross)]
Deeper and deeper
In love with you I'm falling
Sweeter and sweeter
Your tender words of love keep calling (Money grew like grass)
Eager and eager (Money grew like grass)
To feel your sweet lips on my face (Money grew like grass)
Please her and please her
Any time or any place
I'm gonna love you, love you, love you just a little more, baby
I'm gonna need you, need you, need you every day
I'm gonna want you, want you, want you....
