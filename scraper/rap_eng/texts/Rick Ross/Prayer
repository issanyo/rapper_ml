[Verse 1]
Psalm 27, Lord is my light, my salvation
Whom shall I fear? (Lord, forgive me for my sins)
(I ain't cryin', I ain't cryin') cause I have sinned
The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
And before I wrap up this Port of Miami (please Lord, please Lord)
(When the wicked, even my enemies and foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh)
There's a lot of my brothers and sisters (they stumbled and fell)
They wasn't here to watch this come to pass
(Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear)
And since I can't do shit else, I'mma say a prayer (Amen)
(Though war should rise, in this I shall be confident)
Amen

[Verse 2]
This was 12 years in the makin'
No side deals with satan
I'm dealin' with the Maker (straight up)
A lot of homies ask 'What's a prayer?'
A prayer is what kept me focused 12 years
A prayer is what saved me, I should've been indicted
Now my kids know Jay-Z (Shawn Carter)
A prayer is what kept me here, when them bullets cut the air
I fell and I just said a prayer
A prayer's like medicine
It will heal wounds, ask Bush veterans
Big holes in a nigga side
Snub-nose .45, homeboy just close your eyes

[Hook]
Put your hands together, bow your heads
One, keep me alive
Two, keep me out the feds
Three, gotta bless the kids
Four, one for the fam
Five, for the dividends
Dear Lord, here I am
So, I repent my sins, forgive me
One, the grapes on the plate
Two, the tags on the feet
Three, the nights mama cried
Four, I'm thuggin' with the fam
Five, for the dividends
Dear Lord, here I am (Ross)

[Verse 3]
I swear to God I done some things in the past
If I could, please Lord, I'll help you bring 'em back
I feel pain mayn, cause I can't speak on it
That's why I got so many songs, I can't sleep homie (damn man, damn)
Tattoos for forgiveness (crosses)
I might not get it, but forgive me (losses)
I'm here and I'm fightin' like a motherfucker
Triple C's excited like a motherfucker (Triple C's)
Say a prayer, put the weed in the air
Thank God once again for makin' me a millionaire (amen, amen, amen)
I thank God for makin' me a millionaire (Ross)

[Hook]
Put your hands together, bow your heads
One, keep me alive
Two, keep me out the feds
Three, gotta bless the kids
Four, one for the fam
Five, for the dividends
Dear Lord, here I am
So, I repent my sins, forgive me
One, the grapes on the plate
Two, the tags on the feet
Three, the nights mama cried
Four, I'm thuggin' with the fam
Five, for the dividends
Dear Lord, here I am (Ross)

[Verse 4]
I used to get stacks of the hoe zone
Now back to back, covers for the Ozone
Made the magazine, billboard goin' strong
Rollin' in the Phantom, with motherfuckin' Rolling Stones
You stuck with me through thick and thin
Sittin' back, got ya mama sittin' in a Benz (Lord)
Make you damn near wanna cry
Low 95, stack money like homicide
Blood shed after midnight
It's just me and this weed, tryna get right
Blood shed after midnight
It's just Ross and this kush tryna get right

[Hook]
Put your hands together, bow your heads
One, keep me alive
Two, keep me out the feds
Three, gotta bless the kids
Four, one for the fam
Five, for the dividends
Dear Lord, here I am
So, I repent my sins, forgive me
One, the grapes on the plate
Two, the tags on the feet
Three, the nights mama cried
Four, I'm thuggin' with the fam
Five, for the dividends
Dear Lord, here I am (Ross)
