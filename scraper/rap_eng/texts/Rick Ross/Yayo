Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaayo!
Ya-Yo
Hey, I coulda been born any place in the world when I turned a day old
But a brother gotta pass it to the block that's known for more than legos
Not a guap on the pay-roll
But I got got got that play doh
For the hot hot girls on the table
See their lock locks wrapped in halos
Good good money, hood money, that's where you could money, gotta M.I.Yayo
Full of green but it's not for the bagel
Everything that I want to be labeled
All the first 48 watch cable
While they ride 28's unstable
You don't want this up yo' nasal
You ain't never been street, that's fatal
