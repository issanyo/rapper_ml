[Verse 1: Sammie]
I been getting high, just to solve all my problems
I been getting drunk, I'm best friends with the bottle
So much on my mind, I been fucking with these models
She say she don't I'm like shut up.. Swallow

[Bridge: Sammie]
I'm so awesome (yeah), I'm so awesome
Just like social media hit it then I follow
(yeah) I'm so awesome (yeah), I'm so awesome
Money over everything, yeah that's the motto

[Chorus: Sammie]
Welcome to the good life
Where the bottles come in dozens
Where what you thought it really wasn't
Welcome to the good life
Where we pass out till the morning and then you wake up feeling lonely
Welcome to the good life x4

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Booking in the bio, she get so many offers
I flew her out to Cairo, now she with the bosses
In the Belaire gold, got it flowing out the faucets
Shout out doctor Miami he keep the ass the softest
Rings on every finger fat boy the new Tom Brady
Had to move in with me now her room mates be hatin
Empire rolling papers got me out here feeling faded
Been around the world but my shawty treat it safely

[Chorus: Sammie]
Welcome to the good life
Where the bottles come in dozens
Where what you thought it really wasn't
Welcome to the good life
Where we pass out till the morning and then you wake up feeling lonely
Welcome to the good life x4

[Verse 3: Sammie]
I been making money I, don't know who I trust now
Niggas acting funny as, soon as I touch down
Can't tell if it's love cause its too close to lust now
Keep the camera running in-case a hater try to (?)

[Bridge: Sammie]
I'm so awesome (yeah), I'm so awesome
Just like social media hit it then I follow
(yeah) I'm so awesome (yeah), I'm so awesome
Money over everything, yeah that's the motto

[Chorus/Outro: Sammie]
Welcome to the good life
Where the bottles come in dozens
Where what you thought it really wasn't
Welcome to the good life
Where we pass out till the morning and then you wake up feeling lonely
Welcome to the good life x6
