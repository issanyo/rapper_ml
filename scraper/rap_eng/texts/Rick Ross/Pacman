All my power pellets turn you bitch niggas to ghosts

[Pill - Verse 1]
It’s P-I Double “L”
Professional Shit Kicka
Yams on the stove I’m fuckin your Favorite Strippa
Pies flyin out
Them zips they grew wings
Phone going stupid made a rack in two rings
Straight drop hard got them J’s plate licking
Ground basing jumping over cars they Blake Griffin
Got my chickens in the gym, Yup, they weight lifting
See one thousand stamped on the tape because they yay shape shifting
That’s that terminator choppa make a nigga do a backflip
I can show you how crack flip
While I’m loading that Mac clip
Catch em loading that Mack truck
I’ll unload til his back drip
All I know is I’m stacked up
And when I’m back them packs in

[Rick Ross - Hook]

[Rick Ross - Verse 2]
One Hundred in

Same color boy I just got two of them
10 Chains see I’m one ignorant nigga
I’m a whip it just to spend it nigga
Blew a mill ticket
One night at King Of Diamonds
Me and Puff Daddy
Bitch I’m the king of Diamonds
Small change that’s what we call that
A-Rod money smoking on a ball bat
I’m on the mound, I got a pound
My folks in Haiti say them yayo prices coming down

[Rick Ross - Hook]

[Pill - Verse 3]
This that Namco yay

Got these J’s chasing rocks

Met this lady named Eselis
Say she nag for some terrace
But she hungry for that yayo ask her granny what she yelling
Got my shirt off in the kitchen hot in here like Nelly
And these niggas dancing in these mask don’t want stage credit
Just the keys to your car all your cash and your debit card
We serving hard Whole squad equiped and ready
OK then
And quit flexing like you sold a pack
Before they find you slumped over in a Cul-de-sac
My wrist toned from all those hydraulics takin tha paper back
Pink City representa, thought I told you that
