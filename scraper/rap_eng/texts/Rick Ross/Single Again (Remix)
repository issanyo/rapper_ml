Yep, yep, yep, I'm back, I'm back
Slip-N-Slide Records, Slip-N-Slide Records
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm single again back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again, back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again

You know how they do, how they act
See you with another man and they want you back
My ass still phat, they still checkin' for me

And never will you find another bitch like me
And I don't care what your friends say
What we had was like Jay and Beyonc√©
Mmm, or was it all a dream?

Backseat in the Phatom, sippin' that lean
We party like rock stars, we sex like porn stars
I'll sex you a million bars

I'm single again back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again, back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again

Stop callin' me apologizin'
Don't even start it
Hope you find what you lookin' for
Back on the market

Let's agree to disagree
Don't explain shit to me
I got my own money, there's nobody I need
I need, I need my own space

I'm single again, who's who I'm minglin wit
Ball players, center seats to the game
Ring side, still doin' my thing

Changed my number, switched my cars up
6 months bet you maxed your cards up
It all started so promisin', got my own diamonds
So I didn't break the promise ring

I'm single again back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again, back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again

Hold up, wait a goddamn minute
It ain't over 'til I say we finish
'Til I get my half
Then I sit back relax and just laugh

And the times we shared
Like flyin' over Beatmore High in the G-4
Smokin' on Cali bud
That's how real G show a bitch Cali love

Sex in the cockpit
No love, I was just another object
You fell in love wit my ass
King magazine, you fell in love wit my ad

20 G's in the Prada bag
And I'm 'bout ball out
Had to get my mind right
I'm back in the limelight, fellas!

I'm single again back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again, back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again

Diamond princess
Yeah, I'm still the baddest bitch
