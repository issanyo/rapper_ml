[Intro]
I had to take the seats out
I had to put that Balmain interior in the Maybach, nigga

[Verse 1]
She know you niggas monkey niggas
She want a money makin' mogul nigga
Quit smilin' like you know a nigga
You ain't no boss, how you owe a nigga
I'm the flame that the game needed
Let y'all fiends use the same needle
See my chain know the clique fatal
I turned a dream into a record label
Holdin' my hammer, it get cold in the winter
My lil niggas on fire, I fucks with no sex offenders
Got all the bitches, lyrics is vicious
Taylor my britches, reaminin' consistent
I keep to myself, most neighbors be snitches
I bought me a mansion, dope boy in the district
Brick in the trunk, V-7 be movin
Hundred black caskets, in honor of Boobie
I'm shippin that boy, to my dawg in Detroit
Let him run through the Chi', oh me oh my
Keepin' it real, my niggas invented
Beginnin' to climb, your niggas descendin'
Brick haven, if a bitch hate
Must be mad how I'm ballin' like I'm Nick Saban
National champs, look at my rings
Charlie Ward, I play for two teams
DeMarcus Cousins, way of doing things
Call it dirty money, look at all the joy it brings
Gavin Maloof, Rick Ross, Micky Arison
Bitch I'm a fuckin' boss

[Hook]
Keep your enemies close (yay yay)
Like the weed that you smoke (yay yay)
Watch the words that you speak (yay yay)
Leave that shit in the streets (yay yay)

[Verse 2]
Your homie hatin', want to see you home invaded
Tweetin' your location, got all these killers racin'
Meanwhile I'm sellin records, trynna move vinyl
Killin' like makin records, niggas wanna sign you
Hit, hit, go make another hit
Big advance for a nigga he could never get
Nigga hatin' on me send his address to my gmail
On my twitter bio why the fuck you think it's up there?
Fuck your show nigga, I'll fuck your ho nigga
You just a half a brick, I'm that whole nigga
You a half a man, I'm a gold nigga
So when you try me, I'mma throw nigga
That's all I can say (yay yay)
Take 'em to trial (yay yay)

[Hook]
