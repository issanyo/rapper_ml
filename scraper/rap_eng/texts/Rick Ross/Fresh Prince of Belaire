[Intro: Dave East]
M-M-M
Uh
Used to save them bottles
Uh
I ain't never been scared of nothin' I'm my life, dog
If I see it, I got it already
Uh

[Chorus: Dave East]
Uh
Gold bottles, pop 'em like it's '96 (pop)
You never see a brick, I pray to God my team get rich (pray to God)
Black bottles, pop 'em at your funeral
Dirty niggas with clean money, this shit is beautiful (gorgeous)
Gold bottles, pop 'em like it's '96 (pop)
You never see a brick, I pray to God my team get rich
Black bottles, pop 'em at your funeral (uh)
Dirty niggas with clean money, this shit is beautiful
Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire, all they do is stare
Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire, all they do is stare
Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire, all they do is stare
Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire, all they do is stare

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Did a deal with Puma, but Nike, I keep a hundred pair
Stop goin' to Silver Spring, I found out I was wanted there
They gon' bring us so many bottles, the club gonna stare (watch)
Thinkin' you a dime in my section, get dubbed over here (dub)
Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire, but Carlton ain't my cousin
We spark it out in public, too much Luxe got me stumblin'
Black bottle, gold bottle, models by the dozen
But they for everybody, only cops believe in cuffin'
This ain't your average life, they get excited when I come in
On top now, started just underground like Tubman (Harriet)
Thought you was the son, but you wasn't since yo' daddy left
House full of Belair, kick 'em out like they Jazzy Jeff (bye bye)

[Chorus: Dave East]
Uh
Gold bottles, pop 'em like it's '96 (pop)
You never see a brick, I pray to God my whole team get rich
Black bottles, pop 'em at your funeral (my bad)
Dirty niggas with clean money, this shit is beautiful (gorgeous)
Gold bottles, pop 'em like it's '96 (pop)
You never see a brick, I pray to God my whole team get rich
Black bottles, pop 'em at your funeral (uh)
Dirty niggas with clean money, this shit is beautiful
Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire, all they do is stare
Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire, all they do is stare
Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire, all they do is stare
Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire, all they do is stare

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
M-M
M-M-Maybach Music
Your bitch still on my dick but delete the DM (boss)
The Lamborghini's in the street and she know that it's him (woo)
My vodka rum matchin' the beats and it cost me two M's (huh)
These other niggas rappin' rich when we know you pretend (ahh)
I'm always runnin' late but the money in crates (ahh)
Black bottle and two M and a wonderful date (hahaha)
305, MIA, oh, a wonderful place (wooo)
Bought a Checkers to feed my bitches them fries with a shake (rich nigga)
Got her rubbin' on my chest like Justin Timberlake (tell em)
My Belair 'cross the table all the dinner dates (dreams)
Brett Berish on the phone, he billin' every day (Brett)
She know Rozay rockin' ice, now let it marinate

[Chorus: Dave East]
Uh
Gold bottles, pop 'em like it's '96 (pop)
You never see a brick, I pray to God my team get rich
Black bottles, pop 'em at your funeral (my bad)
Dirty niggas with clean money, this shit is beautiful (gorgeous)
Gold bottles, pop 'em like it's '96 (pop)
You never see a brick, I pray to God my team get rich
Black bottles, pop 'em at your funeral (uh)
Dirty niggas with clean money, this shit is beautiful
Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire, all they do is stare
Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire, all they do is stare
Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire, all they do is stare
Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire, all they do is stare
