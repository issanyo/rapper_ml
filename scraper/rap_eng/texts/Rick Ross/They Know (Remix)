(Hook: Rich Homie Quan)
I know I know I know
I know I know I know (What you know Quan?)
You ain’t that nigga you say you is (Well how you know though?)
Just know that I know I know I know (Okay!)
Them streets, they fuck with me strong
And them bitches gon fuck just because money long
You know that I know I know I know
Well you know that I know it I know it I know

(Verse: Rick Ross)
Suede Balenciaga sneakers that a boss a do it
Snitches chirpin like a beeper, better look into it
Bitches wanna step up to another bracket nigga
And she wanna fuck Miami’s richest rapper nigga
So I fucked her like a rapper nigga
All I left her was my swisha wrapper nigga
I brought the rafe like a trapper nigga
Brought the cake to the dealer in the plastic nigga
Sittin in the traffic, you can smell dough
No tints for my niggas with the elbow
All glass in the watches that I wear now
All ass, older bitches that I care about
All cash in yo city then we tear up out it
Got that 308, don’t make me let that air up out it
Fuck around and make me knock yo dreads off
Shots fired, suspect speed off

(Hook: Rich Homie Quan)
I know I know I know
I know I know I know (What you know Quan?)
You ain’t that nigga you say you is (Well how you know though?)
Just know that I know I know I know (Okay!)
Them streets, they fuck with me strong
And them bitches gon fuck just because money long
You know that I know I know I know
Well you know that I know it I know it I know

(Verse: Whole Slab)
We in this bitch 30 deep like 30D
Niggas cappin but they scared, them niggas sweet
Black bottle, crack yo head, now go to sleep
Pussy niggas on Twitter, I’m on the street
I’m bout that life, I play the game just how it go
I fucked yo bitch, she say you lame, I already know
Bvlgari shades on my face, I see no evil
I’m bout that Maybach Music shit, this is the sequel
Slab, time to turn up for these bitches come on
It’s 21, leaving with one of these bitches, I go to blue flame
I put that thing on these bitches so talkin KOD
I spend some change on them bitches and I know
Gotta forward the ex so I po
You say that’s yo bitch, nigga no that’s my hoe
But on Facebook my Rollie is gold
And I know I know I know
Slab
