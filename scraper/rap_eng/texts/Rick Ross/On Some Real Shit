[Verse 1: Daz]
I got trees in a Jar 23's on a car
You can bleed if I star we on the bulevaurd
Got straps simple as dat hand on the trigger
Need 30 mo' Ohhhhh's to add to these figures
See my necks so heavy gotta shine up the Chevy
See ya betta stay wit it or ya gon' get wet
Stay in the fresh shit new fly kicks
Hundred thousand dolla whip nigga dose dat triiiiiip
Get cha walk on, throw up ya set
Yea get it how you livin' nigga rep musik
Diamonds on my neck diamonds on my wrists
Just a lil somethin playa yeea money ain't shiiiiiit
You know the clubs so packed, girls so stacked
Me and my niggas smokin chronic in the back
Got ass so fat, I like it like that
When she get up all on it I'll beat it from the back....

[Hook]
On some real shit
I gotta be the best
I gotta stay fresh
I represent the West
On some real shit
I'm all about the cash
A bitch wit some ass and some drink in my glass
On some real shit
We don't play no games
If you talk slick ya betta be prepared to bang
On some real shit
I got mo' bounce than an ounce
I'll do it to you bad for a large amount

[Rick Ross]
It had to be a dope chain
Started wit the dope game
All about the cocaine
Tired of bein poor mayne
Cracks in a niggas roof
Buckets just to catch the rain
Sellin crack on the roof buckin just to get a name
Now I'm crack in a roof open up the bentley brains
No flaws in the stones, iced out urrrthang
Three colors on a wrist, watch cost anotha fifty
So So Def D-P-G fuckin on some real shit
West coast got the best smoke Miami hoes well known for the best throat
Miami well known for the best dope
Hit the cell phone now for the best quotes (quotes)
You see the pretty paint, you see I'm sitting high
I got a boat mo' the fuck doin 55 (on some reeeeal shit)
Don't let this 4 puond bang ya
This Rick Ross and them Dogg Pound Gangstas

[Hook]

[Daz]
I eat Now & Later, poly seeds, love to smoke a lot of weed
Kahki shorts, white tees, all blue wilda C's
Gotta be the best in everything that I do
I'mma real mothafucka (JD-How to fuckin stay trueee)
I stay away from the suckas mark cowards and bustas
See I'll put it on yo ass do it like no otha
On some real shit feel this, Check how I rep this
See them niggas C Walkin or dat A-Town stepping
I'm so so def so so pathetic
They see a nigga ballin and they wonder how I get it
I gotta keep a weapon, for this type of profession
Nig incarcerate if you slipping yup anyone can get it
On the turn fo' payed like the boss that I work for
Fatty Mazerati and Ferrari and the Lambo, strapped like Rambo
Clip after clip, yeah, I love the set trip and love the sured up shit, but
