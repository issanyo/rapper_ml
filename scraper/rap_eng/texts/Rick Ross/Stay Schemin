I'm tired of being a nobody
What you think you somebody?
I do it for my homies, I do it for the people
Just be your self,nobody need a sequel
Listen up because I'm done messin around
While im spittin this I'm breakin down a pound
Ya boy going ham, just like his town
How am I going to make it is still a mystery
But when I do you will know HOOKS made history
I changed my ways up,and these dudes still hate
But I dont care man, whatever, its straight
Its fuck the world, thats why I wake and bake
Grab my faith board and go street skate
Hit some Treflips and call my boy D
Dont give a fuck bruh what can't you see
Going so hard, harder then I ever been
That's why I passed "M", like the letter "N"
My rhyme game better than edgar allen poes
We are not friends we are more like foes
Stop actin hard and go work on your verse
You couldn't beat me to death if I let you jump first

Damn, I just said that
Yeah I just said
I'm rising to the throne and you bitches gunna bow
I'm so beast the zoo says im not allowed
You are such a fuck up even ya moms ain't proud
You are nothing to me, just another face in the crowd
Sidewalk surfin while puffin on loud
Hahaha Im on that loudddd
