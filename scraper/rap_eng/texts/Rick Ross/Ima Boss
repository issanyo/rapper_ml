[Intro: Meek Mill]
Woo! Woo! (M-M-Maybach Music)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Look I be ridin' through my old hood, but I'm in my new whip
Same old attitude, but I'm on that new shit
They say they gon' rob me, see me never do shit
Cause they know that's the reason they gon' end up on a news clip
Audemar on my wrist, bust down
We poppin' bottles like I scored the winnin' touchdown
'Member me dead broke? Look at me up now
I run my city from South Philly back to Uptown
Thank God, all these bottles I popped
All this paper I been gettin', all these models I popped
I done sold 100,000 'fore my album got dropped
And I'm only 23, I'm the shit now, look at me
Look at me, I'm a boss like my nigga Rozay
Shorty ask'd me for a check, I told that bitch like no way
'Cause I made it from the bottom, it was never no way
And I never had a job, you know I had to sell yay
Bitch I'm a boss, I call the shots
I'm with the murder team, call the cops
We in the building, y'all are not
You short on the paper, you gon' ball or not?

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (huh!) I call the calls (huh!)
We in the bitch, it's goin' down
Yeah I'm the king, now where my mu'fuckin' crown? (huh!)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (huh!) I call the calls (yeah)
Hey!

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Got so many shades, they thought I had a lazy eye
Shorty rode me smooth as my Mercedes ride
No love, cry when only babies die
And when I go, that casket better cost a hundred thou'
I pray to God I look my killer in his eyes
Snatch his soul out that shirt, let's take him for that ride
OG is one who standin' on his own feet
A boss is one who guarantee we gon' eat
Fuck a blog, dawg, 'cause one day we gon' meet
I'ma spazz on yo ass like I'm on E
Or a double stack, bet a nigga double that
Jerry Jones money, nigga, you a running back
Herschel Walker, Bo Jack
Ricky Watters, better run that dope back
Boss, and I put that on my Maybach
Four hundred thou', bitch you wish you saved that

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (huh!) I call the calls (huh!)
We in the bitch, it's goin' down
Yeah I'm the king, now where my mu'fuckin' crown? (huh!)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (huh!) I call the calls (yeah)
Hey!

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Couple cars I don't never drive, bikes I don't never ride
Crib I ain't never been, pool I don't never swim
Fool you ain't better than, I move like the president
Ery'thang black-on-black, you know I be strappin' that
Rattin'-ass niggas walkin' 'round wearin' wires
Fuckin' up the game, got the hood on fire
Bitch I'm a king, call me sire
If you say I don't run my city, you a muh'fuckin liar
Bitch I'm a boss, you a fraud
You cross the line, I get you murdered for a cost (murder!)
Out in Vegas, I took a loss
At the fight we watchin' Floyd we on the floor
Yeah, scared money don't make no money
If I ever go broke, I'ma take yo money
I ain't never dropped a dime, you ain't take none from me
In the hood err'day, bitch I'm good, what I say?

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (huh!) I call the calls (huh!)
We in the bitch, it's goin' down
Yeah I'm the king, now where my mu'fuckin' crown? (huh!)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (huh!) I call the calls (yeah)
Hey!
