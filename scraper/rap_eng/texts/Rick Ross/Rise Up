[Intro: Movado] + (Rick Ross) + {DJ Khaled}
(HUH!) ANYWAAAY! {We The Best Music}
GANGSTAAA... FOR LIFE! (WHOOOO)
HEY!

[Hook: Akon]
Can you hear them now? In the streets they riot, they riot
But we won't stand down - we rise up, we rise up
Ain't no hiding now, when the world's on fire, on fire
We gon' stand our ground - we rise up, we rise up
Hear them, coming, in the dark night
But we won't, go, from where we are, no
Can you hear them now? In the streets they riot, they riot
But we won't stand down - we rise up, we rise up

[Mavado]
Hope and pray for a better day, and a better day will come
Oh so many people dying in the rising of the sun
Oh, and when they think it's over, it's only just begun
Yes, and we should keep on fighting; they could never shoot us down
I'm so early rising up now, and we only fight to win
Got an evil man who host us; God forgive me for my sins
In time, we shall seek, we shall find
There's a mountain to climb, we shall leave no one behind

[Hook]

[Rick Ross] + (Movado)
WHOOO~!
I know they wanna see me fall (ANYWAAAAY~!), I know they wanna see me fail
That's why I go so hard (GANGSTAAA~!), only the real will prevail
I will look into the sky, won't let no man give me Hell (Gully God~!)
As I reach for my sword, drop the gold in a pail - WHOOO!
I love riding with the roof gone (HEY~!), got the money with my jewels on (HEY~!)
Might fuck her with my shoes on (HEY~!) dope boy, need two phones

[Hook]

[Mavado]
This one's for the people, sing this for all the have-nots
Life is like a journey, life is all we've got
Oh, but only if we rise up, and fight together, we could never stop
If we back down for a minute, it will never stop
And they try so hard to fight us... and we try so hard to win
So fight the desert like a cactus... fighting for the Guinn'

[Hook]

[Outro: Akon]
We rise up, we rise up {*4X*}
