[Rick Ross:]
Look in my pockets I see a lot of dead people
Wrist game mean, mother pearl so evil
Christian Louboutin, sucker for a sneaker
Pull up in Pakistan like I’m Evel Knievel
Elroy Jetson I stay spaced out
Never lay my Jesus piece face down
It’s not a Rollie, I’m sorry its for Karan
She not a singer, but dammit I made her humm
Name Ricky but really I’ve been a willie
See you looking at it but this watch a quarter milly
I got houses, hobby homes in Abu Dhabi
Never go wrong GPS my Ferrari

[Chorus]
