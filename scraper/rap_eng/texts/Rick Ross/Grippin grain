Grippin grain
I stay gettin paid
Stay grippin grain
My subwoofer bang
Ride drippin paint
96' we took the herion to jacksonville
Gettin money like a double platinum rapper will
Hoes snortin coke
Im bout my cake
I pay for dope
She won't escape
Niggas peelin Glocks outside silver fox
But its cool runnings
Up in the cool runnings
Ima do somethin
Started tattoo somethin
Shot at midnight
The nigga died around two somethin
Junky jim get a cap and shoot it in his neck
The vein in his arms been blown since 98'
I done seen hoes shoot in between toes
Sixty seconds later everythin seem froze
Call it night work
Watch how the night work
If you could stop watching
Oughta watch light work
A little light work get a nigga heavy dough
Next stop atlanta
Shawty now here we blow
I stay gettin paid
Stay grippin grain
My subwoofer bang
Ride drippin paint (x2)
Who the fuck you niggas think you shoutin?
Who you think you foolin baby? ya snoutin
Go bring that money to me
Dont get ya neck broke
I'll put these hands on ya ho if the tech dont
I sell alot of dope
I keep a chopper close
I get hiiiigh then i let my chopper smoke
We at the deli conversatin
Contemplatin takin the combination to ya safe
Leavin yo condo vacant
I stay gettin paid
Stay grippin grain
My subwoofer bang
Ride drippin paint (x2)
