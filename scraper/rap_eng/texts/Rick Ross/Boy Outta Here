[Ciara, verse 1]

Okay
Step back, Step back
Watch me heat it up (heat it up)
Yeah, I know you want to beat it up (beat it up)
Take a look at my curves, you know you wanna ride (wanna ride)
You wanna take me home tonight

[Hook]

You're speaking in a language that I can't understand, boy
I'm looking for someone that ain't afraid to be a man
I'm talking full grown, it ain't all about them pockets
I need someone that can steal my heart and lock it

All you do is talk about your dollars (boy outta here)
Got a girl and ya still trying to holla (boy outta here)
Got a benz and you're staying with your mama (boy outta here)

It don't make sense, boy I ain't tryin to hear
Boy outta here, boy boy outta here (boy outta here)
Boy outta here, boy boy outta here (boy outta here)
Boy outta here, boy boy outta here (boy outta here)
It don't make sense, boy I ain't tryin to hear

[Ciara, verse 2]

I be on my job, you be tryin hard
Tryin to show out, that won't get you far (ooh)
Like the playoffs, go hard boy or get laid off

[Rick Ross]

I see that see sexy, she see I'm successful
She taste like a Pepsi, she seems to be special
Lets shoot for the stars, I mean how can we miss
The game's totally ours, come give me a kiss

She keep me so freaky, I ball like I'm magic
Lets go half on the falcons, how our paper keep stackin
Crib lookin like Lennox, gotta stay out of fifth
Keep gettin that spinach, like I'm ordering dips

Living richer than ever, this is as hot as it gets
Shoes invincible leather, I'm hard as a brick
Wish to speak to Ciara, that's like making a wish
I always get what I want, that's on top of my list

[Ciara, Verse 3]

Step back
And watch me do it
Turn it up make the ninja [something] jump back
I'm goin hard, I'm going in (I'm going in)
They want me to do it (do it) [something] again

(watch me work, watch me, watch me, watch me work)
(watch me work, watch me, watch me, watch me work)
(watch me work, watch me, watch me, watch me work)
(watch me work, watch me, watch me, watch me work)

If you ain't comin with it, boy outta here

Boy outta here
Boy outta here
Boy outta here

If you ain't comin with it, boy outta here

Boy outta here, boy, boy outta here
Boy outta here, boy, boy outta here
Boy outta here, boy, boy outta here
