Suck a dick, motherfucker

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Hundred bricks, nigga, like a hundred chips
Hundred whips, nigga, another hundred clips
Overseas, nigga, on some hundred shit
Flip a hundred things, moving on a hundred whips
All the mils counted, peep how it feels
Up top, nigga, doing big deals
Big chips, nigga, knowing how to kill
On the field, nigga, do this shit and do it real
Another flip, nigga, stash the cash
We do this, but nothing but some money on me
Another blast, nigga -- pussy
Curve, swerve, hit 'em with that chopper on me
Eleven hundred, flipped eleven hundred
Coke Boys in this bitch, move eleven hundred
Got them whole things in the sand
Uptown, filthy rich, Rich Gang

[Outro: French Montana]
Yeah, yeah
The hardest part about the bid'ness
Is minding your own
You walk in the room
All the whisperin' stop
But you know?
Nosey people get in the face
But real niggas gettin' money
Ya feel me?
They askin' 'bout me in the trap house
E'ry block
Baby whattup?
Rozay
They talkin' 'bout us in the trap house!
