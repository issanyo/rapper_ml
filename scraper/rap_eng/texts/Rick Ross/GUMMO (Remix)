[Verse 1: Omelly]
I'm strapped, I'm slidin' in the whip, in the Bentley with two sticks
Niggas squawking, lot of talking, I'ma park him on the strip
I chase that bag, I stack that cash, I'm quick to take a nigga's bitch
That pussy good, her ass fat, I fuck around and pay her rent
OMG this AMG, bitch it's MMG, squad
Run down on them niggas, catch a body, slide
Any these niggas play with Ross, they know that I'ma ride
Screaming free Meek Milly, that's my fuckin' slime
Sixty on my wrist, sixty on my neck (lit)
I keep it a bean twenty, you niggas in debt (shit)
Niggas said they gon' do me, ain't finish me yet (nah)
Next time I'm on, I'm leavin' candles in front of the step

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Fuck you niggas waitin' on, who the fuck you playin' with?
I was busy countin' money, penthouse layin' with a bitch
Niggas tried to kill me twice, voodoo may have made 'em miss
All black but the jewelry bright, heard you live so scandalous
I see you live a double life, pussy never on the list
Show me what's your body count, nigga where your courage at?
I'm not in to suing niggas, maybe take another route
Give me all them diamonds on you, snatch 'em out a baby's mouth
Hitters know me in the city, see you for the right amount
Where the realest DJ's at, for someone I might buy a house
Summertime, lumber timer, two door, yeah that's one of mine
Dapper Don, Gucci talk, one of one, so hard to find
Pussy where my money at? smoke him like a hundred sack
Shooters go the first round, sign him like a running back
Is it that my flows hard or these niggas' beats weak?
As I get a blowjob, bitch I'm screamin' free Meek
Walk up in the dope spot, niggas give me free weed
All that cappin' in your captions make me wanna kill a bitch
Hustlin' and real estate, and I keep it militant
Bitches must've thought I died, heard I'm still on life support
Rims on every car of mine, fuck you think I bought 'em for?
DMX on IRS, really ain't no time to rest
Homicide investigatin', name be in all kind of mess
Hahaha, hahaha, studied like I'm Farrakhan
Bitch I'm in the 305, call it little Lebanon
And I know you always slippin', hit you and whoever on
Caught him leavin' top golf, time to knock his top off
Sometimes I know times hard, but the Maybach top soft
Calling plays like Brett Farve, double-M is not lost
She see niggas pockets fat, while she bein' forcefed
Shawty think I'm gang banging 'cause my newest Porsche red

[Verse 3: Koly P]
I heard they plottin' on a murder
That forty waistline, free Meek Mills and Bobby Shmurda
Niggas hatin', so I went and bought a bracelet
And bust down my Rollie, bought a store and made a statement
Have you heard of me? came a long way from doin' burglaries
Last week I got shot and counted sixty after surgery
Rap game messiah, every beat I spit that poetry
Might give that ho some money, she can't never have my loyalty
'Bout a dollar, I'ma take the lead and watch 'em follow
Thank God Lil Koly rappin' 'cause he used to be a robber
Killed my nigga Nola, from the time, know I had that black Impala
I'm really with the shits and hittin' licks out with them choppers
(I'm Koly P)

[Verse 4: 6ix9ine]
I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take a nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out... but I fucked that nigga bitch
Niggas iffy, uh, Blicky got the stiffy, uh
Got the blicky, uh, drum it holds fifty, uh
Move milli', all my niggas on fifty, uh
Talk down, pew pew pew, you silly, uh
Hit a stain, fifty bands, all hunnids
Spinnin' through ya block, like a pop shove-it
Shoot at me I'm shootin' back, I'm gettin' buckets
I ain't wanna take his life, but nigga, fuck it
I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take a nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out... but I fucked that nigga bitch
