[Rick Ross:]
Master I got this, you heard me?
Them niggas hatin us
We run the show
We all pay the rolls, the suckers pay the role
No shots till you hear the shots fire
Niggas wanna be hot, no it’s not time
So make foes out of best friends
Scuff timbs but the truck Benz
Breaking rules for play the fool
Shout out my fools, back in Haiti to
We get money when the coast clear
Two hundred foot yatch name it No Fear
My phone dead, but I make calls
We make money then we make more
I told her one day she could be a boss
Baby a baby Julie green wall
Yea, we the team lean on
Butt naked in the pool with my rings on
Money machines on, tell K.Michelle a new kings on
This the theme song, mastermind my baby, sing on em

[K. Michelle:]
