[Intro: Red Cafe]
I wanna let you know
Appreciate what you doin'
Just wanna salute you
You do got the trophy right

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
Know a down one for me
Now the fickle with me
My day one, that's my baby
Been right here all alone and she got her own
I love that, that's my baby
And she knows

[Hook: Red Cafe & (Jeremih)]
You're making me proud, making me proud
That's my baby
(My baby, my baby she knows)
You're making me proud, making me proud
That's my baby
(My baby yeah)

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Girl you got all these stalkers
All these niggas tryna buy you Porches
Ass so fat need it softest
No strings attached, just keep it cordless
I'm kidding, do it taste like peaches?
I used to have a girl named Peaches
But you on a next level
Got a feeling your finna be my best ever
You making me proud, you're making me proud
You know I'm finna put work in that pretty old thing
So I'm blowing this loud

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
She telling me I need to change
But baby I need the change
2 coupes, 2 bricks, life's too short
Cocktail, 2 Glocks and a Newport
I put my money where my mouth is
Number one anywhere the south is
Rich niggas, you can tell by the outfits
High tops, Versace, I'm on that boss shit
Count cash on the tarmac
For you new niggas gotta run the car fax
VIN numbers that don't match
She telling me this money won't last

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
Girl you got all these stalkers
You woke up like that huh, flawless
Breaking all the rules, you living lawless
What you a Pisces or Taurus?
Libra or Cancer?
I just want that for breakfast
Make this move and no extras
Girl you fly like an overnight letter
All I wanna do is make your overnight's better, wetter

[Hook]
