[Hook: John Legend]
Some people think I'm crazy, ohhh ahhh
They think this paper changed me
I'm glad to see another summer
I got to thank the one above us
Glad to see another summer
Glad to see another summer, yeah

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Young Renzel, let's get it
Look me in my eyes and tell me what you see
You watch the homie come up from a mustard seed
Ain't looking for no problems, just a chance to eat
And I make mama a promise I'm gon' plant my feet
Had some trouble on the campus for the skills I lack
But I double all the profits and I'm quick to stack
Only thing hung in the trapper was a triller plaque
Two tone double lard tucked in the back scene on the beach
Supremes on my feet
10 summer fast break, Kareem with the leap
Who own mansions in 12 states?
Ross fit, I sell weight
I keep it real like we were cell mates
Out in Denver, having dinner with the Elways
Boss
(Maybach Music)

[Hook: John Legend]
Some people think I'm crazy, ohhh ahhh
They think this paper changed me
I'm glad to see another summer
I got to thank the one above us
Glad to see another summer
Glad to see another summer, yeah

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
I need another summer, that's just enough to fall in love again
Already high as fuck, but I ain't done with you, I wanna smoke again
Like the wind of it all depends on when the temperature hot
So cold, come into my spot
And our clothes said it was too hot
Go slow, just remember this part, babe
Cause when summer is over, noooo
It's gon' be cold
