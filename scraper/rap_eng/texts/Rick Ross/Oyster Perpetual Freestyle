[Intro]
In this game it's all about timin'
It's all about your movement
Ours is oyster perpetual
Swiss, so accurate
Presidential
The dirty niggas, right?

[Verse]
I'm smokin' to the face, I'm floatin' outer space
Hermes house shoes, gettin' straight to the cake
Hundred bottles, chicks stare, it's Aristotle
As I money launder, laundromats on every corner
Coin operated like them boys out in Vegas
Beatin' fed cases like reprimandin' these fifth graders
Skip the Phys Ed, and yoga, bipolar
Get the big bread, so focused I'm bifocal
Two women, Twin Towers, I'm hittin' sour
Second innin', grape Swishas, they're Drake's bitches
But that's my nigga, share bitches, we big business
Real niggas, gettin' money, we splittin' millions
Condominiums, brick or key, fickle V
Get the thickest bitch out of King of Diamonds to tickle me
I got a lickin' fee, 68, I'm diggin' deep
Pull the yachts out, Bel Air, Virginia Key
I'm on err' tackle, errwhere, Brian Urlacher
Err dollar, underneath my girl urr mattress

[Outro]
I'm nice with it, nigga
MasterMind, March 4th
Streets are mine
Black bottle boys
Haha, Ciroc lifestyle
Double M
See you real soon, niggas
Hahaha
