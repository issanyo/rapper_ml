Every time i call she come
Cuz every time i call she get to come
The mama love it look what this shyt done
When i used to keep her rollin on them bitches like which one

She graduated from the school of arts
Now she swimming in a pool of sharks
Roughest niggas with the coolest cars
Sophomore year had her first minja

Met in dc lik gobra
Drunk it lik a fiji and blew my socks
Every night she comes through for me to fuck that
Found out she had a man i hollad fuk dat
Better give that boy a bus pass
I see no competition baby girl a must have
