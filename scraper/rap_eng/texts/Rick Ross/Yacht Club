[Intro: Magazeen & (Rick Ross)]
Yeah, just somethin' different ya know
Ricky Ross the big boss (It's a secret society baby)
Maga-to-the-zeen (All we ask is trust)
Yeah, to the ladies dem (Nothing's changed)
All of them Northside ladies only
(Run with me or run from me, yeah)
Dem real fall just-a like the sunshine
(Pussies don't get pussy, yeah)
Yacht Club, Rich Club (It's the Yacht Club baby)
I brought kush too, haha (I got this)
Maybach Music!, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
He's not bigger than Biggie, bitch I'm bigger than you
It's just a boat to mi casa like a milli or two
Gotta kick off your shoes, okay let's take a cruise
Here's my captain now relax, let him do what he do
Okay who rollin' spinach? Cause I'm reelin' the anchor
Smoke up an acre a grass, wake up in Jamaica
Couple nautical miles, I call my Cubanos to cop
Puerto Rico for women, hit Barbados to shop
Livin' larger than life, call this the yacht club
Before you join us bitch, ya gotta get your stocks up
She walkin' back and forth, she's just itchin' to fuck
And then I heard her whisper, "Girl, you know he's rich as fuck"
Travel the seven seas, there is no better breeze
If he indulgin' jealousy his ass better breathe
Man overboard cause he goin' overboard
Damn it's over for him put that on my vocal chord

[Hook: Magazeen]
There's a party, going on
All the girls they welcome to the Yacht Club
Magazeen, let them in
There's a party, going on
All the girls they welcome to the Yacht Club
Magazeen, let them in

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
My talk is priceless
Turn me up a little bit, I feel bossy

Kill all the middle men, I'm the militant Gilligan
Speakin' Creole and gentlemen as I cruise the Caribbean
Oh Lord I'm a star down in St. Barts
The fat Tommy Lee, I made out with like eight broads
Put up in Costa Rica, I get the most of features
She no *speakay no englay*, maybe Fat Joe could teach her
Smokin' barrels of reefer, only the yacht club
Before you join us bitch, ya gotta get your stocks up
Travel the seven seas, there is no better breeze
When we started sellin' kis that's just how we thought it would be
No one agrees with me, but that's just how it goes
I'm the greedy genius no reference to the ugly clothes
I still hustle for dope, but no more me scuffin' my soles
Make the presentation and trust me the customer sold
I'm cruisin' in the gulf, I think you're so deaf
Janet was in control, because the hoe left

[Hook: Magazeen]
There's a party, going on
All the girls they welcome to the Yacht Club
Magazeen, let them in
There's a party, going on
All the girls they welcome to the Yacht Club
Magazeen, let them in

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
My dick a big stretch and quick to tell a bitch fetch
Tell you to kiss her ass, after you bought the bitch breasts
Her head above average, my head above water
By now you could see my palace, right off the coast of Florida
I'm into fine fish with a slight lime twist
Veggies on the side of course, kush appetizers
Let your Mercedes chill, roll with a Navy Seal
This the yacht club, wanna trust me your lady will
Still spillin' champagne, or is it Merlot?
Fuck it, it's fine wine, my bitch a Virgo
I don't do the signs, unless there dollars on 'em
I'm the boss of the boat, cashmere collar on 'em
Thinkin' of last year, and all the money's made
Now it's corporate invested, amongst the other things
No one agrees with me, but that's just how it goes
I'm the greedy genius no reference to the ugly clothes

[Hook: Magazeen]
There's a party, going on
All the girls they welcome to the Yacht Club
Magazeen, let them in
There's a party, going on
All the girls they welcome to the Yacht Club
Magazeen, let them in
