No way
Nuh uh
And u ain't him
Stop it with it right now
And u ain't him

Here I is sorry to keep you waiting
But now I'm back with more fire than satan
Listen
Wish man this track is blazing
Better yet this track amazing
This track remind me of when the studio was down in this Nick Day's basement
My shit was far from legal
Wrong place in a buick regal
Check under that seat look in that lil box in the trunk sure illegal
Hold up better pump your brakes
You don't wanna make no mistake
Running up on the wrong nigga and the wrong time might get you something hot in your face
And I ain't talking bout no mase
I'm talking that shit that chase
That shit that a run ya down and take Forensic files gonna solve that case
I hear a lot of that I did this
I hear a lot of that I did that
It's funny when he go to the stand and point at his man like "he did that"
You wanna stand looking so not gangsta
Plead to the judge "I'm so not gangsta"
(i believe you)
See it's best you play your part
You don't try to be who you aren't
Ain't gotta prove anything to me motherfucker I know you ain't got no heart

[Hook]
You say you got your money right
I don't believe him
You say you live the street life
I don't believe him
You say you got them killas with you
I don't believe him
I know a gangsta when I see him lil' buddy and
U ain't him
No, no, no
And u ain't him
No, no, no
And u ain't him

[Rick Ross]
When you keeping it trill
Alota Suckers wanna ride
Cutting corners in the '65 on skinny ties
You telling lies
Selling pies
I'm selling mine
Shots fired but expired by the 7th time
How the fuck you cool
You don't even know the rules
He just flew the coop and got chickens he wanna move
But I'm a handle this
Show em how it's gots to go
Before you get to management you gotta mop the floor
He's not a hustler
He's not a gangsta
Go get your word let me tell ya so sucka thank god
I'm a boss
You gotta grind if you wanna floss
Baby we boss buffing that pine as I'm peeling off

[Hook: Rick Ross & Nelly]
They say you moving chickens right
I don't believe him
They say you got a meal ticket right
I don't believe him
Say you got a white phantom too
I don't believe him
I know a hustler when I see him lil nigga and he ain't you
You say you got your money right
I don't believe him
You say you live the street life
I don't believe him
You say you got them killers with ya
I don't believe him
I know a gangsta when I see him lil buddy and u ain't him
No, no, no
And u ain't him
No, no, no
And u ain't him
No, no no
And u ain't him
