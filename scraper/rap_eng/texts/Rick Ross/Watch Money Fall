[Bridge: Juicy J]
I stopped going to the stripclub a long time ago, because, um, I just invite the bitches to my crib, yeah

[Chorus: Juicy J]
NBA numbers (numbers) and I don't need a jumper (jumper)
10 racks nigga (nigga), I just blew a comma (comma)
And I got that shit back, I call that karma (karma)
I got these niggas hot just like the summer
Shawty throw that ass up, watch money fall (fall)
Watch money fall (fall)
Watch money fall (fall)
Shawty throw that ass up, watch money fall (fall)
Watch money fall (fall)
Watch money fall (fall)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I got the hmmm, NBA numbers ain't no layin' up
So much money, you can count it, gotta weigh it up
You ain't got this kind of change, better save up
Iced out, championship rings, bitch you know what'ssup
Watch the cash jump out, you look like a Kardashian
You got ass like Kylie
You might even be finer
You know I'm a big tymer
You the baddest thing I done found inside a ace of diamonds
Make it flood in this hoe
Autograph your boat
Rick James, I'm toasted
Ain't no standing on sofas
She only understand dollar signs
Can't holler at her, you broke
You know Juicy don't play around
My money long, jump ropes

[Bridge:  Three 6 Mafia & Juicy J]
Mafia
Yeah Hoe

[Chorus: Juicy J]
NBA numbers (numbers) and I don't need a jumper (jumper)
10 racks nigga (nigga), I just blew a comma (comma)
And I got that shit back, I call that karma (karma)
I got these niggas hot just like the summer
Shawty throw that ass up, watch money fall (fall)
Watch money fall (fall)
Watch money fall (fall)
Shawty throw that ass up, watch money fall (fall)
Watch money fall (fall)
Watch money fall (fall)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
M-M-M-Maybach Music
Throw the money up
She watch the money fall
She know I wanna fuck
She say that's not a problem
This bitches booty big
She know my bank bigger
Bitch, my bank teller
Might have some bank, nigga
I roll that cavy up
Yes, that's a caviar
Blowin' smoke, I got it smellin' like the salad bar
No time for beefin' with these crab niggas
But that shit slap, gotta call a cab, nigga
I'm out in Bel-Air and I'm sipping Bel-Air
If it's less than seven figures, I could care less
Contract like I'm playin' for the Spurs, nigga
Lend a hoe a hunnit bands in her purse, nigga
M-M-M-Maybach Music

[Chorus: Juicy J]
NBA numbers (numbers) and I don't need a jumper (jumper)
10 racks nigga (nigga), I just blew a comma (comma)
And I got that shit back, I call that karma (karma)
I got these niggas hot just like the summer
Shawty throw that ass up, watch money fall (fall)
Watch money fall (fall)
Watch money fall (fall)
Shawty throw that ass up, watch money fall (fall)
Watch money fall (fall)
Watch money fall (fall)

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Tattoos on the booty
Tattoos on her titties
Piercing on her nipples
Hand on her kitty
Dancing, magic city
Booty shaking battle
Bands in my hand, pet that ass like a pedal
So much beef on shawty ass like kettle
And she ride deep like strap in a saddle
Throw that bitch a bankroll
Watch her whip a pistol
She don' scraped her whole rent check
Off the fizzo
