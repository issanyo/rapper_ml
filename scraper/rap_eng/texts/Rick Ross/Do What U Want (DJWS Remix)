[Intro: R. Kelly & (Rick Ross)]
Said, it feels like a remix, yeah
(Maybach Music)
Feels like a remix, yeah
It must be a remix, yeah
(Lady Gaga, Rick Ross)
Ooh, ooh
(It's special right here)
Gotta be a remix, yeah
(You're so special right here)
Ooooh

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Photos of the boss, just post 'em on a blog
Get a lotta views 'cause they know we be the top
Jean Basquiat's in the middle of our hall
Ooh, she's my work of art so I pin her to the wall (haha)
Sex in the dark, underneath the waterfall
High as a space cadet as I'm leapin' over stars
Enemy of the state, they got a target on your boy
(Maybach Music)
'Cause I'm the hottest 'cross the board
Cruise through the ghetto, Mulsanne made of metal
Hangin' out the window, Bruce Willis on the pedal
Pool on the roof, black bottle for a model
I gotta keep it fly
Mosquito doors on the auto
Boss

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
I, I feel good
I walk alone
But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up
And then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart and, you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice, 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Early morning, longer nights (yeah)
Tom Ford, private flights (yeah)
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in, 'cause it's our life
(But let's slow it down)
I could be the drink in your cup (cup)
I could be the green in your blunt
Your pusher man
Yeah, I got what you want (want)
You wanna escape (oh)
All of the crazy shit (let go)
You're the Marilyn, I'm the president, -ent
And I love to hear you sing, girl

[Pre-Chorus 2: R. Kelly]
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Back in the club, taking shots, gettin' naughty
No invitations, it's a private party
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Yeah, we taking these haters and we roughin' 'em up
And we layin’ the cut like we don't give a fuck

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & (R. Kelly)]
You can't have my heart and, you won't use my mind (my mind)
But do what you want with my body (yeah)
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice, 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose, if you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body, and don't stop the party

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & R. Kelly, Both]
You can't have my heart and (help me now)
You won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body (with your body)
You can’t stop my voice, 'cause
You don't own my life (you)
But do what you want with my body
(When I want, when I want, when I want)
Do what you want with my body

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, girl
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, world
Help me now
What you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
Want you want with my body, girl
