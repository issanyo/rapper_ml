[Intro]
Rick Ross-
YMCMB, Double M G
We rich forever
Maybach Music!

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Walkin' through the crib you can hear the waterfalls
Like the projects out in Philly bumpin' "I'm a boss"
If I'm feeling shorty you know I'ma floss
Did my thing in the summer my money somersault
Now I'm at the dealer with the worst credit
Got a yellow carat now I smoke lettuce
Let her count my bread she a bank teller
Can you keep a secret? I'm a rich nigga
Got the new ghost in the drop 2
That's 800 racks when I stop through
Dealing with the same team talking way back
Now I deal with big cream theme Maybach
Shes a thoroughbred, so her bags new
Welcome to the fam that's a 100 rack move
All in a duffel, baby, you could call it yours
Countin' all day now I call it chores
You inherit real estate when you stay in line
Can you imagine even livin' in my state of mind?
Strawberry swisha sweets in my Aston
Bumpin' slim dunkin' tryin' to live this life of mine

[Hook: Bruno Mars]
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can't understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
With everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it
Look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the..

[Hook: Bruno Mars]
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can't understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again

[Verse 3]
I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see that guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin' at the..

[Hook: Bruno Mars]
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can't understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again

[Verse 4]
Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in the broken mirror
I see my mama smile that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message could've been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the..

[Interlude]
MJ taught me that
Take 'em to Mars, man

[Hook: Bruno Mars]
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can't understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again

[Outro]
Hey B.P., looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time?

So why are we, talking to each other again...
