[Intro: Rick Ross]
Bird, park that body nigga
Let's take 2 or 3 of them shits to the head nigga
What!

[Hook: T-Pain]
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
'Til the sun come up, 'til the feds run up

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Life in the fast lane, been scared of airplanes
Comfortable on jets, hoes better learn my last name
Yay in the carry-on, that I'm 'bout to carry on
After all the deals, I still deal and carry on
Versus the past, we all shed tears
That's why I pop pills, the end so near
The crackas don't work, niggas just snitch
Lose trial, that's a bitch, nigga go sit
Three hots in the car, where the surf 'n' turf
Three blocks in the car, I'm gettin' what it's worth
From the boss to the bottom, top off the Phantom
Buyin' up the bar so the ladies gettin' at him

[Hook: T-Pain]
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
'Til the sun come up, 'til the feds run up (we hustle on)
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
'Til the sun come up, 'til the feds run up

[Verse 2: Glasses Malone]
You see my eyelids fallin', but sleep prolong
Daddy can't sleep 'til this work all gone
Drub broke down, 10028 zone
I'm seeing new trucks over 28's chrome
Brand new Benz is 600 ponies
Candy on the bitch, candy on the coating
Dreams so sweet now, it's my reality
Nigga don't bite cause you might get a cavity
Now hold me down, clown, call that gravity
Stash so dumb, mine's ridin' shot gun
Doin' 90 down Crenshaw, gotta be careful
Or end up murdered like Cain causin' hell

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Youngin, this for the Bird Lady
Su-woo, yeah nigga

Pontchartrain Beach, ocean, seas
Fleet, red CMB
UPT where I be
Comfortably (believe dat!)
Louis with the suede on
Rockin' them jewels cause we paid homie
Laid on it, played on it
See a mill like nothing, how we weigh it homie (100!)
My honey, she know I'm good with the K
Doin' it how my niggas did it back in the day
Now my lil' nigga all good with the spray
Young Money, everyday

[Hook: T-Pain]
