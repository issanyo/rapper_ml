[Intro: Future]
My daddy bust a nut and got a millionaire
Type a nigga to fuck a pretty bitch anywhere
First night you tryna hit it raw
Old dog ass nigga
We the best and no else can come close
I pray to god, I pray to god

[Future]
I fuck that shit up then I leave
I seen the kids in the ghetto
Homicidal intuition
I had to sell crack just to pay my sister tuition
And I just came from off a mission
Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm still geechi
I'm still geechi
I fuck that shit up then I leave, then I leave

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Fascinated with these gold Daytons
Fast paper what's the motivation?
Vacant soda make it moonwalk
White club money stuffed in my tube sock
More money, more power
The world is yours, that's until I get my main shower
Butterfly on kilos
Show my the money cause I gotta feed my ego
Big coupe with all my niggas rent due
Put my life on it I can show you how a brick moves (Boss)
Thug Life, 2Pac
I'm a boss I can get your whole crew shot

[Hook: Future]
I fuck that shit up then I leave
I fuck that shit up then I leave, then I leave
I fuck that shit up then I leave
I fuck that shit up then I leave, then I leave
I pray to god (I pray to god)
I pray to god
[?] the pain and the struggle and [?] hoe

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm flying first class as the snakes slither
Never blackmail a motherfucking killer
On trial and they gonna execute me
It's really sad this the fact they never knew me
Niggas claim that they thugging, when they dick riding
My niggas rather walk through they own, brick climbing
All black tees, ten gold chains
At the Super Bowl but we in the dope game
Ten years strong in the same trap
Ten years blowing on that strong pack
Lord knows that I wanna live right
But lord knows what that club live like

[Future]
I fuck that shit up then I leave
I fuck that shit up then I leave, then I leave
I fuck that shit up then I leave
I fuck that shit up then I leave, then I leave
I seen the kids in the ghetto
Homicidal intuition
I had to sell crack just to pay my sister tuition
And I just came from off a mission
Yeah, yeah I'm still geechi
I'm still geechi
I fuck that shit up then I leave, then I leave
I fuck that shit up then I leave
I fuck that shit up then I leave, then I leave
I fuck that shit up then I leave
I fuck that shit up then I leave, then I leave
I pray to god (I pray to god), I pray to god
