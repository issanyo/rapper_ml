One time for the niggas that’s huggin’ the block
Two times for the boys thats bubblin’ rock
Three times for the G’s including myself
Four times for the brothers that’s reachin’ the wealth
Five times for the hustle I taught it myself
Transporter I bought it myself/
I bought it myself/

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Niggas major, tailored suits, the newest gators/
Gangsta, I’m muthafuckin’ Albert Anastasia/
Michael Corleone, presidential Rolly on/
Net worth unknown, closet full of Skull and Bones/
Silver spurs come his and hers, just live and learn/
Snipers on the roofs like troops, that’s for whom it concerns/
Applaud the whores abroad, awaiting my return/
Ressurected like Makaveli, pray my soul burns/
Sole supplier for cocaine in Southern states/
Sending sack city to city, back in a couple days/
Don’t get me started, I make triple in fickle markets
My profit margin’ll have all you local niggas starving

One time for the niggas who huggin’ the block/
Two times for the boys who bubblin’ rock/
Three times for my borhters who reachin’ the wealth/
Four times for the G’s including myself/
Thinking back when a nigga never had a quarter/
Much love for the bitches wearing something shorter/
Five times for the trap, got a nigga ballin’/
But I gotta take my hat off to the Transporter/

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
When I’m looking for a certain feeling, gotta hit her raw/
Look up to my ceiling ladies, chandeliers galore/
Look into my closet then you know I love couture/
Even more, shoe collection too fly for the fucking floor/
Shelves, Louis V in jails/
Shoot the fucking stylist we gon’ find this shit ourselves/
Audemar was designed by Swizz Beatz/
Black face, black band, orange stitching, it's a beast/
To say the least, I am extraordinaire/
Transporter yeah I bought it, pistols in the air/
Sole supplier for cocaine in Southern states/
Sending sacks city to city, back in a couple days/
Don’t get me started, I make triple in fickle markets/
My profit margin’ll have all these local niggas starving/
I got them thangs, I’mma tell ya once/
Better have your money right, you won’t see me for months/

One time for the niggas who huggin’ the block/
Two times for them boys who bubblin’ rock/
Three times for my borhters who reachin’ the wealth/
Four times for the G’s including myself/
Thinking back when a nigga never had a quarter/
Much love for the bitches wearing something shorter/
Five times for the trap, got a nigga ballin’/
But I gotta take my hat off to the Transporter/
