[Intro: Rick Ross]
We don't count money no more, we weigh that
You may have seen me, nigga, in America's Most Wanted as "The Boss"
We get Euros, nigga, Pounds, fuck with us

[Hook: J-Money]
Money, what you doing? I'm getting wild, dog
Money, how you feel? I'm relaxing, dog
Money, what the business like? The streets loving me
What you tell them, Money? I'm straight ballin'

[Verse 1: J-Money]
Just signed a new deal, now I'm back in business
I ain't stop at nothing, I didn't learn my position
Never take for granted, get it while you got a chance
Never worry about about the next man and his advance
I'm from a small city, I get it how I get it
I'm down with Spoon Dog, motherfucking critics
Y'all say I'm kissing ass, I don't give a fuck
I'm down with my niggas dying to see me blow up
The ones that talk shit, the outsiders looking in
I'm getting money, blowing up, bitch I'm ballin'
My swag so serious, my clothes unbelievable
My Bentley max out at two-sixty, it's unbelievable

[Hook]
I'm ballin'(x8)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm talked about in every circle like I'm larger than life
I'm sparking up that deadly purple, never flossed in my life
On the block, I got my people working, that's a part of my life
If I don't ring in next to Foxy, shit might just start up a fight
Them rumors on and in and yeah, but I ain't into that
I got twenty chickens in Memphis went off in the cinema
They watch me like I'm Cinemax, you'll never see me nigga
Fuck your views, on my end the views ain't gonna beat me nigga
Own restaurants, croissants, my Grey Poupons
Proceeds 'till we perceive the stunt like Donald Trump
A new phase, no todays, new phase, no more Coulier
Two K's, who wanna play? Two days, I want to break
It's time to boss

[Hook]
I'm ballin'(x8)

[Verse 3: J-Money]
I wake up every morning thinking 'bout my next Dollar
I brush my teeth, get dressed, Money get them Dollars
See I'm a businessman, I get it by the stack
Whether I'm in the trail, or even when I rap
Bitch, I make money, money don't make me
I grind hard, nigga, got money chasing me
I moved my first quarter at age thirteen
And I can't stop, nah, cause I'm living my dream
I got the tightest whips, fuck the baddest hoes
Diamonds on my neck (bling), Gucci on my clothes
Bitch, I'm J-Money, big Money Money
Talk make this shit, yeah boy I'm stuntin'

[Hook]
I'm ballin'(x8)
