[Verse 1: Adele]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet, to go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus: Adele]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Renzel, aka Ricky Rubin
I miss you kissin' my lips, consoling my confidence
Apologies from the heart is something thatâ€™s heaven sent
Scars for the flesh, war wounds for the soul
Success is another test and we wanted the highest score
Mother did her job, fundmental love
But it never was enough cause I wanna be a thug
Tears fall all the way to the south of France
Poverty line hang lower than my pants
Invited to the Grammy's but I feel so out of place
After we washed plates and they was always out of steak
That is a sin, I was built to win
Came to win the title, Rozay wavin' in the stands
Academics was a myth, I can always plead the fifth
Or give it to you live, Beethoven on the Fifth
Your favorite films tank, Titanic sank
Aroma of the dank as I'm breathin' through the bank
Black market open for business from the poors to the riches
From the poors to the riches
From the poors to the riches
From the poors to the riches
Ricky Ross

[Chorus: Adele]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge: Adele]
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Anymore

[Chorus: Adele]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
