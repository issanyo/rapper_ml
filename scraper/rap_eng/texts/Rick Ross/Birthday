I'm a Be Honest, Tomorrows Not Promised That's Y I Say This
Here Today Then Your Gone Like Renting A Car From Avis
Hurts But It's The Truth, Your Diving Out That Mercedes
That's Y I Be One Point, I'm Never Procrastinatin
U Better Be Dodging Satin The Pussy Nigga Be Hatin
Want His Cake And Eat It To, Then U Do Greasy Like Bacon
Everyday Money Chasin, I'm So In Love With The Fragrence
So What I'm A Little Impatient, U Dope Man Ain't Got No Patience
Boy I Feel Like I'm Racin, Before I Become A Raisin
Those Strippers Hotter Then Cajen, My Daily Be In Rotation
The Daily Birthday Occasion, I'm Rarely Off Of Vacation
I'm Barely Owing The Nation The Nelly Dollars Are Rakin

I Ain't Talkin Next Year
I Ain't Talkin In A Month
I Ain't Talkin In A Week
Err Day I Wanna Stunt
Err Day I Want Sum Candles
Err Day A Hundred Bucks
Err Day I Pull Up In Lambo, Filet Minon For Lunch
Where My Birthday
U Got My Birthday
When My Birthday
U Better Day My Birthday
I Get Emotional
That's Wat C Notes Will Do
Them Penny Loafer Shoes, Help Me Cop A Bently Coupe
Now My String Of Woman Hotter Then Cambells Soup
Boy That Cake Will Make Them Priests Turn Into Animals
I'm King Kong, And It's Your Trainin Day
Denzel With The Ice And I'm Pushin Weight
I Ain't Tryina Make Em All
I Ain't Tryina Down Pay
If Biggie Got A Wife She Ain't With Him Not Day
Ain't Nobody Here To Stay
U Can Try To Get Away
I'll Bounce A Nigga Prey
My Advice Still The Same Ayy
