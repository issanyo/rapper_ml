Welcome to the world, welcome to the world

You got your popstar, I'll be your rockstar
When it´s a suicide, you call it superstar
Check out the forecast
Predictions won't stop
You get your fifteen, and
Then they take the spot

Let's go, let's go
And then you´re ready to go
Let's go, let's go
Cause it´s the end of the show
Let's go, let's go
So just get ready to go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go

All the time that you were gone
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you´re coming down to earth
Ok, hello, welcome to the world

She saw the bright lights
She caught the fever
She got contagious
She never leave it
So no more time spent
And no more free shit
In fact this free ride has
Reached it´s destination

Let's go, let's go
And then you´re ready to go
Let's go, let's go
Cause it´s the end of the show
Let's go, let's go
And when it´s over, you´ll know
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go

All the time that you were gone
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you´re coming down to earth
Ok, hello, (welcome to my world)
Welcome to the world

Life's a tour, I´m so sure
The ex will come before you exit girl
No more games, I confess
Far from lane I´m just so fresh
While cubit lee ??, it´s the big boss
You get on the block, mr Rudolf
Kevin! 2 stars, hold your applause
Hold it down to y'alls all guitars
Half my life I sacrificed
But I only came to party tonight
New chicks, get my drinks up
Every weekend we can link up
New rings, with the big cuts
Only be the best sport, get your mix up
I took my time she love me, me such
When she closes her eyes it´s
What she thinks of
Boss

All the time that you were gone
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you´re coming down to earth
Ok, hello, welcome to the world

Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
