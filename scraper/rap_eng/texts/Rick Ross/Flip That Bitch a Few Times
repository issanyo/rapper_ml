[Hook: Rick Ross] (X2)
Flip that bitch a few times, flip that bitch a few times
Mama always said, flip that bitch a few times
Got a brick in the trunk, you know I gotta get mine
Mama always said, flip that bitch a few times

[Verse 1]
Never gonna sleep, never gonna fall, always on top, never gonna crawl
Keep it in moving, never on pause, picture perfect, never a flaw
Never afraid, Glock at my draw, making them racks, flipping them cards
Wherever yet, I stay at the bar, mafia niggers, still in the jar
Make it rain, pop a champaigne, give me the money, fuck all the fame
I be the nigga you love and hate when you're serious in front of them saying my name
Know you're the bitch, she giving me brain, back at the bus, back of the Range
Back at my crib, back at it again, but soon as I nut, she leaving my place (Ho)

Flip that bitch a few times, flip that bitch a few times
Mama always said, flip that bitch a few times
Got a brick in the trunk, you know I gotta get mine
Mama always said, flip that bitch a few times

[Verse 2]
Selling dope ain't easy, police watching you
Niggas don't trust niggas everybody wanna shoot
His blood is your blood niggers don't know what to do
Always gotta have goons, everything is bullet proof
Thinking about your main bitch she could be somewhere telling shit
While you're at the club stunting, feds at your residence
But you gotta hustle bro, junkies need they medicine
Never lose a customer, keep on stacking presidents

[Hook: Rick Ross] (X3)
Flip that bitch a few times, flip that bitch a few times
Mama always said, flip that bitch a few times
Got a brick in the trunk, you know I gotta get mine
Mama always said, flip that bitch a few times
