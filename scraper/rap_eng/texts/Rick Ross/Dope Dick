[Intro]
Ain't no makin' love to a young dope boy
A young rich nigga
This that dope dick
She addicted to that dope dick
I got her hooked, got her locked, talkin' 'bout
Rolls Royces nigga, what else woe?
Dope dick, back seat, front seat

[Verse 1]
Since I came in the game, you niggas philosophies changed
Chasing money, Geto Boys and Underground Kingz
Wrote the rules on how to ball without a bodyguard
Learn to move or get hit with the John Gotti charge
I pray you niggas never lose a minute to a cell
Or lose your manhood in a yard, painted nails
Fairy tales of pretty bitches livin' prosperous
Your text is quoted, dead bodies never bothered us
At the park was a thing, but we skipped the swing
Very place I first seen my first triple beam
Dirty game, pillow talkin' witcha mayne
Giver her dope dick and all the things that she would say
She the one that put me up on Netflix
At the concerts I keep her on the guest list
Freaky things, sex scenes, a bowl of ice cream
My advice to her is time to trade to my team

[Hook]
Dope boy, dope car, I got the dope dick
Dope dick, the bitches love me for the dope dick
Dope dick, I fuck her slow with the dope dick
Slow dick, dope dick, I got the dope dick
Tell her friends she wanna watch you get the dope dick
Black bottles, late night givin' you dope dick

[Verse 2]
100 room mansions, I paid all of the tax
No shots, but I write all of my raps
3 pointer, Harold Miner when I lean on yah
Post memes I got the toaster and the beam on yah
Broken holes the size of a token and the barrels to smoke yah
Know it's home invasion cause his front door is still open
When I give you game, niggas better pay attention
I'm the big homie on these missions, little niggas listen
Survived the drive by but they gave you the shakes
Know you tellin', nigga, they played us the tapes
Screamin' Maybach but I came in the Wraith
Put you in the casket, now stay in your place
Where I'm from gangbang is a thing of the past
Only thing matter if you black, you getting some cash
If the groupie fuckin', then give her a pass
When she lookin' for instructions, I give her a class

[Hook]
Dope boy, dope car, I got the dope dick
Dope dick, the bitches love me for the dope dick
Dope dick, I fuck her slow with the dope dick
Slow dick, dope dick, I got the dope dick
Tell her friends she wanna watch you get the dope dick
Black bottles, late night givin' you dope dick
Black bottles, late night givin' you dope dick
Black bottles, late night givin' you dope dick

[Verse 3]
Out in Philly I got Courtney off in the Bentley with me
Niggas saying non see me I hear other opinions
Well educated and she got the strap
On the road to riches, bitch I can rewrite the map
Still stuffin' money in a minivan
200 acres, goofy I just built the Disneyland
Get Rich or Die Tryin', yeah that was 50 plan
Filed the chapter 11, guess the nigga kidneys failed
Bitch so bad, she in a bidding war
If she needed bone marrow, I woulda did it for her
Went from slice and dice pineapple and now it's pears
Addicted to this way of life, never have any care

[Hook]
Dope boy, dope car, I got the dope dick
Dope dick, the bitches love me for the dope dick
Dope dick, I fuck her slow with the dope dick
Slow dick, dope dick, I got the dope dick
Tell her friends she wanna watch you get the dope dick
Black bottles, late night givin' you dope dick
Black bottles, late night givin' you dope dick

[Outro]
I can’t come to your crib unless you got that Netflix account baby
(dope dick)
Add that 10 piece lemon pepper on flat waiting for a young rich nigga, make sure valet know who it is. (dope dick)
I hate to have you give valet that talk, ya heard me. (dope dick)
Pistol under the mink mats
One staying with me, (dope dick)
2 for 2. 2 door, 4 door (dope dick)
That’s when I’m gonna give it to her
Ya heard me (dope dick)
I ain't playin no games, (dope dick)
Real nigga, real hustler
She wanna sit it on my face huh, (dope dick)
I’m gonna bust....with that though. (dope dick)
I’m gonna give you this dope dick
I got you hooked. I got your mind, your body, your soul
You love me baby, you love me baby
