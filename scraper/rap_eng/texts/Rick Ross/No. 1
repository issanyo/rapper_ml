[Intro: Diddy]
Ayo, Bugatti boys (turn 'em up)
You know what it is
Breathe, bitch, breathe
Breathe, bitch, breathe, go

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Hello good morning, tell me what the lick read
My cup full, blowin' on that good weed
My bitch bad, tryna get her tipsy
In all black, haters better miss me
My bitch ride better then most rappers
Here's a Rose toast to those rappers
I don't smoke no tobaccos
But I smoke the most rappers
I got big tips for the waitress
Bitch I got very little patience
All the bitches different by the car load
You may wanna get a different auto
Deep down ya main chick even wanna cum
Everybody know my name, I'm number one
I'm number one

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I'm number one in this bitch
Now they understand why I'm runnin' this shit
From the bottom to the top
I be ballin' 'til I drop and I'm never gon' stop
I'm number one in this bitch
Now they understand why I'm runnin' this shit
From the bottom to the top
I be ballin' 'til I drop and I'm never gon' stop
I'm number one in this bitch
Now they understand why I'm runnin' this shit
Now they understand why I'm runnin' this shit
I'm number one in this bitch
Now they understand why I'm runnin' this shit

[Verse 2: Diddy]
I'm the first one to cut a new Phantom in half
First white two-seater down fifth Ave
First one to write a check in the earthquake
Same motherfucker that'll make the earth shake
Blowin' money only way to make the earth spin
Ya girlfriend caught up in my whirlwind
Used to move white girl out in Maryland
Now my girlfriend blonde like Marilyn
We number one, we gettin' mad more paper
Ain't nothin' like Bad Boy paper, we ain't never gon' stop

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Woke up this morning blessed to breathe
Then I say a prayer, God bless the G's
I'm number one in this bitch
Now they understand why I'm runnin' this shit
From the bottom to the top
I be ballin' 'til I drop and I'm never gon' stop
I'm number one in this bitch
Now they understand why I'm runnin' this shit

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I'm a gang member, my gang called
Bugatti Boyz, ask your main broad
The streets cold, my wrist's numb
I do it big, ask my income
The bigger I get, the more you deflate
My niggas deal dope at a rebate
Spit flows like it's freebase
All the flows I can erase (erase)
I think I made need goggles
All my bottles sparkle
I'm the only one she obey
Cause it's only one Rozay

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Woke up this morning blessed to breathe
Then I say a prayer, God bless the G's
I'm number one in this bitch
Now they understand why I'm runnin' this shit

[Verse 4: Trey Songz]
You can say I'm on some new shit
I be number one and you niggas can get the deuces
Maybach Music, play it in the coupe
It's Rick Rozay and Trey so stupid
Tryna find ya girl but I prolly made her lose it
Body so tight and I know she get the loosest
Virginia to the whole world, you can get my old girl
Catch me in Miami 'bout four girls, tow girl
I'm hot, holla at me when the summer done
Never been where I'm comin' from number 1

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Woke up this morning blessed to breathe
Then I say a prayer, God bless the G's
I'm number one in this bitch
Now they understand why I'm runnin' this shit
From the bottom to the top
I be ballin' 'til I drop and I'm never gon' stop
I'm number one in this bitch
Now they understand why I'm runnin' this shit
I'm number one in this bitch
Now they understand why I'm runnin' this shit
From the bottom to the top
I be ballin' 'til I drop and I'm never gon' stop

Now they understand why I'm runnin' this shit
Now they understand why I'm runnin' this shit
