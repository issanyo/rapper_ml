[Hook]
I'm fresh from my head to feet
737 get like me
So fly but we keep it so street
Check my swag and do it like me

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm flyer than the best of them
Fresher than the rest of them
737 bitch, that's the new testament
Picture perfect specimen of pimpin' in the flesh
I make, top down music or ? just to flex a bit
Debonaire veteran, know your tired of peddlin'
With petty rappers who say they're trappers with no medicine
Plus I'm riding better than, half of them who swear by that
Know that I'm a client, but i'm still the player president
Lavish is the residence
Plus I fuck with Meryll Lynch
Hotter than a kettle bitch and I got precedence
Over lames who claim they on some better shit
Bitch niggas delicate, been the shit ever since 1983
80's baby and i'm hella rich, rhyme' while i text your bitch
Tell her she's my favorite, let her suck me out
She like vanilla berry flavor dick
Jiggolo I'm heaven sent, niggas hate to use it

Verse 2
Man I'm on the scene with a polo and jeans that's so clean
You should see the way your bitch neck lean when I'm gleamin'
Niggas say they fly but they don't understand the meanin'
Suave House, we been here we not leavin'
Jiggolo I'm cool but look see these heathens
That bust a nigga head on sight no more breathin'
Just give them a reason to click and then clack
Don't try em they been to jail and they dyin' to go back
You ain't 737 cause you got a little beamer
Pockets on beast buy you earn a little leaner
Man up a squad pimp you better get your team up
Flood you like Katrina, you gonna need FEMA
A great imagination but an even better dreamer
To think that you can see us, it's best you try to be us
To go to war ? probably need Jesus
Please believe us we will not ease up

[Hook]

Verse 3
See I used to be modest about it but they doubters
So I put it in their face and let them see that I'm about it
You wanna shine like me but your cues too clouded
These VVS's got my charms so crowded
If you could only see all this money that I've counted
Came a long way from pushin' carts in Thomas County
Now they crowd around me, tell me I'm that new nigga
From Phoenix to Mississippi, I'm down to talent nigga
No need for a hint of febreze
My feces is so easy on the nose, it's like berry and roses
For those of you that's slow, my shit got no odor
Flip her like yoga, fuck her and then show her
To the door cause, I'm on a dough hunt
I'm runnin' circles bout this paper call me dough nuts
And this is no luck, I'm in the fore front
Cuz I'm the shit, fuckin' dirty roll the ? up
