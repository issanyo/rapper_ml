[Hook: Pharrell]
I don’t tick so I’m the shit just like a presidential, I roll around
The time is ours it's really ours
Take off the H it's really ours
Put your Rollie in the sky and wave it high
Put your Rollie in the sky and wave it high
Put your Rollie in the sky and wave it high
Put your Rollie in the sky and wave it high

[Verse 1: Ross]
You know the crib on the water now
The Maybach stay watered down
Project niggas giving orders now
The gold presidential just to sport around
I'm from the era of fitted caps and rental cars
Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads
Walking on Jewish marble, hand painted the ceiling
Happy Hanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feeling
Got my seats on the wood, playas giving me dap
Lyor like how I move, Warner right in my lap
I made a few mils, ain't mentioning Meek
Went and bought a new crib the weekend Wale released
Bitches, they keep coming, Billie Jean thumping
I need to hear the trumpets, meaning machine gunning
I ain't missing nothing, got her sipping something
I could ship her something, you know that December coming

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
I'm a young fly nigga just reppin for my era
I be touchin hella bread like I'm workin at Panera
Got a bad bitch with me good green with me
Travelin' round the world but I'm comin from the city
Where Kanye did it, Lupe did it
Now Rockie Fresh is the next to get it
Fresh pair of Jordan's and my White Sox fitted
New gold Rollie that was Rick Ross gifted
Playin in my mind day dreaming about a time
When I get a track with Pharell
Thinkin that'll be dope as hell
I started layin' verses and makin' these rappers nervous
I love God, but I could never work at a Church's
I'm just buying chickens purses
Hangin' with the best set
Shorty love the way I be swimming in that wet-wet
I keep them flyin' in my bed that's where she jet set
Smokin with my bitch while I'm thinking of my next check

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
They see me leanin' in some new shit
Now it's gold Presidential's for the crew shit
Three songs, weed crumbs on the cruise ship
I'm a boss have your ass on a news clip
She a dime but she gotta be a cool bitch
Ponytail red nails still in school bitch
Needed some cash so she ask me could she move shit
Not a chance whips got her talkin' foolish
I was skippin them classes, but I got me a master
I was gifted at Math always counted the fastest
Fish scale made me major profit margins
I'm a profit stuffer from my pockets, you niggas starvin'
Lord forgive me for my sins I'm with this pretty bitch
80 grand rubber band for some silly shit
She on that Alexander Wayne
Gold Presidential VS when I change the game

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
She want to roll with a winner now
So I let her roll with the windows down
My niggas up the road come and get it now
60 40 low we split it up the middle now
Shorty send the word I was talkin' that talk
Maybe link up in New York that's awesome as fuck
I've never been in love until I heard the beat
She never met a G until she heard of me
Third floor projects feel my point of view
Everything's number two that's when it come to you
Isabel Marant sneakers till the summer through
Fuck you on a yacht is what I wanna do
Baby girl got that wet wet, I repeat wet-wet
I'm the boss and I'm on that
White T gold Rolex

[Hook]
