[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Met her down at the mall
Me and Gucci coppin' Gucci
Gucci that's my road dawg
Flippin' chickens for the sushi
Mustâ€™ve been the Creed Cologne
For baby girl to read my zone
Or them red monkey jeans
They made her wanna ring my phone
There they go, there they go
A big ol' pack of pretty bitches
There they go, there they go
We them niggas with them 6's
There they go, there they go
Countin' all that freaky money
See this freaky money, see this weekend money
Look at me, I cook for her
Then I make her cook for me
She make me cook her lobster tails
I make her go and cook a ki'
Catch a flight, first class
Don P every glass
Next year we private jets
In the clouds havin' sex
Cum once, cum twice
Rick Ross dumb nice
Baby girl take sum advice
And cum and fuck ya boy tonight
Come fuck with a fat nigga baby
Fuck with a rap nigga baby

It's time to hit you from the back baby

Bundles a bags so my woman can brag
Belle harbour bell boys say I'mma wonderful dad
Excellent pimp saute the shrimp

Same kind that ya rent
No minute man, this dick long term
I love to get brain, girl I wanna learn
You could show me that, you could teach me things
Welcome to the mall, here's ya first pinky ring
20 karats, 20 grand, Paris Hilton linen bed
Cocaine drug lord, live at the vibe awards
Sittin' on the third row, call it the bird row
I'm next to Birdman Young Jeezy Kurt Blow
We all legends
Legends in the game we was at legends back in the 90's Maine
Now I'm like a ghost, in the white Phantom
Take her home, fuck her in the wife manner

Fuck the games, girl I need a super freak
She soakin' in the sauna, I smokin' on a leaf
When we come together, I always do my job
She let me hit it hard, hit it, hit it, hit it hard
I stroke and stroke I poke and poke we rope a dope she won't Let Go
I give her a stack, she gives me pleasure
When baby girl down with me, it's whatever
Fuck that movie shit, I'm on that puchy shit

Hit ya from the back, fuck and flip ya like ya crack
