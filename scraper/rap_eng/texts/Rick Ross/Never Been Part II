[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, hundred thousand dollars, it may sound like it's a lot
Really it's not to me, now grab some of this weed and roll this pot
I had to speed up, cause all these niggas slow
I probably won't be up in there if I ain't got an O
Now I got my feet up cause I'm on top and niggas hopin' that I stop
But I'm just smokin', livin' life like in the movies that I watch
In my jacuzzi, roll another doobie
See what's newest on Netflix, order another movie
See I'm smokin' the best shit
Mo'fuckers ain't ballin', so they're seein' the exit
I stay on my job so you can see I'm up next
Dawg I be goin' so hard, some say I'm needin' some rest
Got so much smoke in my lungs, it ain't s'posed to be on my chest
And niggas talk but don't even be on them jets
Man they don't even seein' them checks
But you can tell by how I spit it, nigga I be gettin' dough
Take her all the places that she never been befo'

[Hook: Amber Rose]
(Don't give a fuck about the)
Money, clothes, cars
I've never been, this far
And fuck that other shit them niggas talking about
I've never been, this high

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm in my Grand Natty, smokin' on that granddaddy
It got an odor like a motor runnin', fantastic
Never the minor things, I'm movin' on to finer things
Yellow stone, diamond rings, Balmain designer jeans
Chanel frames, Louis scarves, movin' like the mob
I'm gettin' money, so maybe baby come get a job
So fuck them other bitches, we onto other business
And fuck them other niggas, we at them dollar figures
Versace chains, gold rollies, it's the same game
Racked up, shawty, Ros√© bottles every day
Sipping that purple stuff, twistin' the pretty leaf
Pull up in that Ferrari, this bitch in disbelief
On the road to the riches, 'nother crook in the castle
Only fuck with my niggas, pray we all livin' lavish
I pray we all livin' so lavish
I pray we all livin' so lavish

[Hook: Amber Rose]
(Don't give a fuck about the)
Money, clothes, cars
I've never been, this far
And fuck that other shit them niggas talking about
I've never been, this high
