[Intro: Rick Ross]
It's the boss Rick Ross
Mark Morrison, living legends
We've been around the world 305 times
Going for 306

[Verse 1: Mark Morrison]
Ever since you went away
My life ain't been the same
Even though they know my name
They don't know full my pain
Cause you were the best I had
Even though I did you bad
You know I loved you bad
And now my life is sad
The things I said to you
The things I made you do
When you said we were through
Why didn't I stop you?
From going out the door
Instead I (?)
And I don't know what for
Cause now I miss you more

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
Been around the world
Met lots of girls
Just the way I lived my life
Met lots of girls, lost lots of girls
Just the way I lived my life
Been around the world
Met lots of girls
Just the way I lived my life
Wastin' my time
Losin' my mind
It was the way I lived my life

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Young nigga hoppin' out a Rove
Young nigga hoppin' out a Ghost
Just bought a teli in LA
Young nigga walkin' out the Lowe's
5500 for the low
35000 for the show
I've been pourin' up the purple shawty, you know what I do
So what you doin's workin' shawty, you know what you're doin'
And when I lay beside you shawty and I be fuckin' you
I'm mixin' up the purple shawty dope in soda you know what the fuck I do
I've been only fuckin' you
I've been only fuckin' you

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
Been around the world
Met lots of girls
Just the way I lived my life
Met lots of girls, lost lots of girls
Just the way I lived my life
Been around the world
Met lots of girls
Just the way I lived my life
Wastin' my time
Losin' my mind
It was the way I lived my life

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Spotted you on the beach, she the baddest on Collins
Making love in my Phantom, all the things she would holler
Sexy now that's a fact
I would kiss it when it was waxed
Hittin' it straight from the back
This Return of the Mack
Pinky stay up and do it
One kiss and she feel the fluid
Now you runnin' with winners where all we drive is the newest

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
Been around the world
Met lots of girls
Just the way I lived my life
Met lots of girls, lost lots of girls
Just the way I lived my life
Been around the world
Met lots of girls
Just the way I lived my life
Wastin' my time
Losin' my mind
It was the way I lived my life
