[Chorus: Russ]
I think this might be paradise
I just hope it lasts forever
I think this might be wonderland
I just hope it lasts forever

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Get you out to France, fly you out to Nice
Or we can chill out in Atlanta, let's enjoy the feast
We can do the spa, we can do the mall
I bet it do the job, she wish she with the Boss
Livin' like the movies, which she work for
I got the fitty in the crib, that's on the first floor
Belaire with the lemons what she thirst for
Digging for your soul, your spirit's what I search for
Bricks and baguettes, ain't nothing above this (Maybach Music)
Tongue-kissing with sex, we fell in love quick
Red leather double R, I'm on some Don shit
Black bottle boy and all white bosses

[Chorus: Russ]
I think this might be paradise
I just hope it last forever
I think this might be wonderland
I just hope it last forever
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Russ]
Looking around at the collision of ambition and vision
I'm really starting to believe that I just dream for a living
I couldn't play it safe, that's way too risky for me
Instead, I'm walking out of shows with like 250 on me
I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to hustle on it
Too busy looking for success, that's how I stumbled on it
Russ got the potion, fuck just hoping
Luck tends to bet on the ones in motion
Wrote one check, took care of my parents' debt, tell the IRS
Six figures doesn't make me sweat, I'm flying on jets
G4s for four of us, real spacious
Bought my family cars and I buy them all places
Apartment complexes that I own, low-key shit
Getting paid from rooms where haters probably send tweets
It's seamless, becoming what I meant to be
God just keep on blessing me in front of all my enemies

[Chorus: Russ]
I think this might be paradise
I just hope it last forever
I think this might be wonderland
I just hope it last forever
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Nothing last forever unless you talking 'bout my rap game
I can do it to you like this or like that man
No pressure on me, I'm the freshest homie
Walk by faith, to see me is to know me
Undeniable, reliable, as fly as they come
The prodigal son and I am the one
Insurmountable funds, that's for my daughter and sons
See I remember getting nickels, dimes, quarters, and ones
See I ain't looking back no more, I'm up in paradise
Eating steaks and shrimp like a pimp and that's err'night
Stepping out the shower, to a mink floor
I'm in the Hills, getting money, I got pink toe
Max my stacks just like Rico, penthouse suite at Tinico
I open my blinds to get a view
Now tell nigga what it really do?

[Chorus: Russ]
I think this might be paradise
I just hope it last forever
I think this might be wonderland
I just hope it last forever
