[Intro: Rick Ross]
Ciroc Boy forever
But this Belaire Ros√©
Has to be the world's finest
Just for the record
Feeling real good right now Grammy nominated
Soundtracks, straight up

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm growing my cheddar, my champagne warm
I had to struggle to make it, I die for my charm
Used to call me dyslexic it was a challenge to read
Mother held me at night until I finally achieved
Sometimes I look in the mirror I can't believe I'm alive
Disrespectful to niggas who wanna take me alive
Wishing death on you niggas we never see eye to eye
Some how I pray for you niggas at the very same time
See I was raised in the South, you helped your brother to shine
I watched everything change in a blink of an eye
Rappers wanna be ballers, ballers wanna be rappers
When the liquor endorsements worth more than your masters
Here's a toast to Ciroc, all my boys on the block
I might be drunk on the couch but I'm raisin' the bar
Raisin' the bar, I'm just raisin' the bar ugh huh
