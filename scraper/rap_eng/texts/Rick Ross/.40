[Intro: Adrien Broner]
40, 40
Woo!

[Hook: Adrien Broner]
Hit the club at 12:40 with like 40
Strapped at the 40/40 with two 40's on me
If I get 40 bricks, I let two go for 40
That's 40 gone, now I need 40 more
F-f-forty, the watch I got, it cost me 40
The drop I dropped, it cost me 40
Ridin' with that 40 got me feelin' naughty
Don't say my real name, just call me 40

[Verse 1: Adrien Broner]
I'm ridin' dirty with the 40
I just may be a dirty 40
You got caught and told 40 stories
Before a nigga tell shit, I'm doin' 40
My bitch Rollie cost me 40 racks
5K on my pinky, that cost me 40 flat
Niggas see the 40 and start runnin' track
Swear to God he ran a 4.4 in a 40 flat
40 licks, that's 40 bricks
They gave my uncle 46 for 40 bricks
And he went in when he was 40
Now he come home 2040

[Hook: Adrien Broner]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Just poured a half a pint up in this Mountain Dew
They call me Kilo Shawty, known to act a fool
So if you come with 40, then I'm snatchin' 2
I learned to whip it back in '92
I keep a pack of bitches like they backwoods
First nigga with the wraith with the black wood
Spent 400 on another rolls
The lambo sat so long I even had it towed
40 on the Rollie with the Glock 4
I run this bitch if a pussy bitch block 4
It's not funny if you hear me knock
Narcs come and get the money, stop money, switchin' numbers

[Hook: Adrien Broner]

[Verse 3: Adrien Broner]
In the club with like 40 niggas
That's 40 40's, 16 hundred with us
I know you see me, sometimes I see you niggas
If I put 40 on your head, bet they don't see you, nigga
These niggas' 40, still tryna be that nigga
Bet when I'm 40, I'm still gon' be that nigga
Miami night, like KOD, man they took 40 bitches
Man that was 40 bottles of liquor and 40 strippers
40, hit two licks on West 40th street
Me him at the spot, charged him 40 apiece
I'm up 80 at 9:40, my mornin' was sweet
Now I'm done for the day, I made 240 this week
