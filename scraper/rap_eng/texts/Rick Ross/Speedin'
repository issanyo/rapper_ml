[Intro: Rick Ross]
Legendary
Runners
You know me
Trilla

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Every dollar that I count can't grow in my account
My account can't count up all my money in an hour
Cause it's comin' too fast and I'm scared it won't last
Look that white girl in her face, told her this was her last dance
God damn, speed got my heart racin'
See I don't have the nominations you can blame it on my occupation
Ceasar salad, Caesar's Palace
You not a boss little nigga cause your cheese is average
In the Benz, AK ridin' shotgun
It's a Benz cause you're broke 'til you got one
It ain't nothin' do 100 in the Maybach
Throwin' money out the roof motherfuckin' brake pads

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Fast life, I live
Big cars, big cribs
Speedin'
I'm speedin'
I can't stop it's all I know
From a young'n I was taught get dough
I'm speedin' (speedin')
I'm speedin'

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
See people came lookin' for me, I got ghosts see the west coast
Close and up in the Le Montrose
Big money boss major
American Idol, I got fans like Fantasia
Read between the lines or yo ass like fantasia
Get hit between the eyes, he died, they can't save him
In the Porsche, I’m weavin', no coke, no coke but I’m speedin'
Starin' at the skyline, I got a million on my mind, I'm the best
And these pussy niggas runnin' out of time, Ricky Ross
I'm the chill, quarter mill for the time piece
Yeah, I a bought a wheels like deals for the dime piece

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Fast life, I live
Big cars, big cribs
Speedin'
I'm speedin'
I can't stop it's all I know
From a young'n I was taught get dough
I'm speedin' (speedin')
I'm speedin'

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Sittin' in the living room watching the Grammys
Wishin' that was me that was on the Grammys
All I needed was someone to get behind me, money rain on me
I was a determined lil nigga, dirty shoes and Hilfiger
Homie help me out cause this boy is a drug dealer
Now I'm flyin' high cause my gift grew wings
And now I'm flyin' down like the cool crew winds
Kells and Ross on the Hollywood scene
Red carpet and it's smellin' like green
Now foss cause I got paid off
Collabo was the hit hip-hop and R&B boss

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Fast life, I live
Big cars, big cribs
Speedin'
I'm speedin'
I can't stop it's all I know
From a young'n I was taught get dough
I'm speedin' (speedin')
I'm speedin'

[Outro: Rick Ross]
We fly I think somebody followin'
We hear the helipad with ya bitch
You worth fifteen million baby
Don't try to blow it all in one week
Overseas boss (I'm speedin' I'm speedin')
I'm a fly away on you haters
And I came up so fast, movies, endorsements, films
We own things, boss
