[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Say Khaled I'm going in so you can gon' bring in back
Gon' bring it back, I said gon' bring it back! (Ey!)
A straight monster in this bitch
Nigga, poltergeist
It's dade county in this verse, they gon' say Jesus Christ
And like Rihanna fine ass, I'm gon' live my life
Ten bands and take one, call it being nice
Get your hands up and that's a direct order
Got my bands up, thanks to the transporter
Thanks to the transporter?
I'm like yeah sorta!
Got my name hot, be around like South Florida
Get your hands up if your not living right
Now keep your hands up
You risk it err'day and night

[Verse 2: Plies]
If I die tonight, bury me in the hood
With all the jewelry on, make sure I'm looking good
Rob who nigga? I wish a nigga would
Point 5, don't shoot, that's how the lames do it
Word on the street somebody put a hit on me
I'm in the foreign, top off, look like I'm worried homie?
Better send them now, got bout a mill on me
You rob me; I kill you, now that's a deal homie
Two-twenty-three
Carbon one-five
Old black bitch with me, that's that forty five
Been real, never snitched nigga my whole life
Heard a nigga whacked him. He shouldn't have testified

[Hook: Schife]
If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!
D Boys on my tease, put your hands up!
Independent bad bitches, put your hands up!
If you know this how you living, put your hands up!
Where they at?
Put em up!
If you know this how you living, put your hands up!
Put em up!
Where they at?
Put em up!

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I'm hotter than a Kawasaki in the projects
Burning more than rubber, money ain't a object
I'm number 1, and hurt they feelings in the process
Cop a bird, then your really seein progress
I'm buying cars like I'm in a contest
Say my name, rappers lookin like a bomb threat
I'm the winner, these beginners talking nonsense
Brain from your ? till she render me unconscious
I'm so conscious of DNA in my closet
My show account can't take another deposit
Ladies heartthrob labelled me the odd ball
3.5 cause I'm known to start small

[Hook: Schife]
If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!
D Boys on my tease, put your hands up!
Independent bad bitches, put your hands up!
If you know this how you living, put your hands up!
Where they at?
Put em up!

If you know this how you living, put your hands up!
Put em up!
Where they at?
Put em up!

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
This the biggest street anthem in the hood right now
I got the streets on fire with this one
Somebody pass my ?
That's the new thug passion
This we the best music
Put your hands up!
