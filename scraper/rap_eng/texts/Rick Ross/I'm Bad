[Hook]
I'm bad, I'm back

Nigga what you want, nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs, leavin' with a bitch!
I'm bad, I'm back

Nigga what you want, nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs, leavin' with a bitch!

[Verse 1]
Ain't no limit to the shit I start
Automatic start on that big white car
Pearl paint job, nigga you can't rob
Four chains and a watch, pocket full of knots!
Spots, I'mma git my stacks
This crack comin' back like that income tax
Told ya once he told ya twice
You need mo' then a knife, you wanna rock that ice
I'm bad, magazines up the ass
Stolen yellow cab come squeeze on ya ass
He a flash, all black mask
Rappin' ass nigga talkin' all that jazz
Ride up on him show, him how we get down
100 rounds in this clown butt naked and he pound
Tell the truth, that nigga be rippin', ain't it man?
Just got a Chevy and I got my shit painted man

[Hook]
I'm bad, I'm back
I'm mad, I'm strapped
Nigga what you want, nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs, leavin' with a bitch!

Nigga what you want, nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs, leavin' with a bitch!

[Verse 2]
Used to be on the corner, on marijuana
Now it's marijuana, from California
Big buds, bitches with big butts
Big BMW's home of the dick sucks
My Bob Marley is bumpin' like bitch what?
My money bumper to bumper now bitch would
I'm bad, I'm back, I'm mad, I'm strapped!
Nigga what you want, nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs, leavin' with a bitch
I don't see no nigga when I'm on the grind
All I see is hoe niggas when I'm on the grind
.45 no nigga, know I'm holdin' mine
I'mma knock his ass down if it's own his mind
Tell the truth, that nigga be rippin', ain't it man?
Just got a Benz and I got my shit painted man!

[Hook]
I'm bad, I'm back
I'm mad, I'm strapped
Nigga what you want, nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs, leavin' with a bitch!
I'm bad, I'm back
I'm mad, I'm strapped
Nigga what you want, nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs, leavin' with a bitch!

[Verse 3]
B - fo' da Bullets in niggas who gotta die
A - fo' da Addicts and junkies who gettin' high
D - fo' da Dope distributed at the dock
Still on the block, clock no socks
B - fo' da Bass, bitch I gotta boom
A - fo' da Ass, in my hotel room
D - fo' da Dick, dick that I slang
Since money talk, I'm addicted to my slang
B - fo' da Bang
A - fo' da K
D - Ditch that car for the smooth get away
I'm bad, I poke ya ass in the nose
With a cold .44, now he cold on the flo'
Layin' on his back, like he posed fo' a hoe
When ya actin' like a bitch, gotta go, gotta go
Tell the truth, that nigga be rippin', ain't it man?
Just got a Hummer and I got my shit painted man

[Hook]
I'm bad, I'm back
I'm mad, I'm strapped
Nigga what you want, nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs, leavin' with a bitch!
I'm bad, I'm back
I'm mad, I'm strapped
Nigga what you want, nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs, leavin' with a bitch!
