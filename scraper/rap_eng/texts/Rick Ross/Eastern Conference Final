[Intro: Jadakiss]
It's a tough thing to digest, you know? Yeah

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Release the content, cease the nonsense
You're dealin' with the beast of the Eastern Conference
All the hate do is just increase the don's strength
You pricks are harmless, the clips are arm-length
Right after you dab, do a couple of bong hits
Razor work mean, buck-fifty the long rips
At any moment it could get funky as armpits
When they comin' so fast that it fuck with your conscience
Out-out-out there where the water is different blues
Lookin' at the yachts, he ain't able to pick and choose
Just like on the block, do your thing, then stick and move
Learn 'em by heart, so you never forget the rules
A room full of smart people never forget the fools
They all want to shine, but they don't ever get the jewels
Top five is always in the discussion
The hood love 'em, they could see 'em, they could touch 'em
I8, he's in the BM and he's clutchin'
Without your freedom, it means nothin'
Uh, marijuana, simple therapy
The paper will keep 'em off of you temporarily
Ain't nothin' change, I be in spots them niggas never be
Did the same thing they did, just did it cleverly
I just took my time, I ain't let 'em hurry me
May the young king Chinx Drugz rest heavenly

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
My niggas did concrete up and down Wall Street
All-brick (-), valet occasion
Cracks in the pavements and Cartier bracelets
Courtroom cases, steaks and crustaceans
Cameras flash like Kardashians in mags
Fit the descriptions of clients that daper Dan
We the flyest, do most shoppin' in France
Just to stand on the corner, nigga, ball above the rim
LeBron James, they want me on film
Battier Defense, fightin' a new appeal
Shots fired before I could write a will
A shot back, bosses hard to kill
And I never wear it twice, lobster over rice
Hottest in the game just by lookin' at the ice
Parked parallel, the seats are caramel
You only live once, so fucks your farewells
Top five, still alive in that small talk
Still top dog, niggas, while you fall off

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Rozay, Jada, what's up, MM, we rich, nigga
