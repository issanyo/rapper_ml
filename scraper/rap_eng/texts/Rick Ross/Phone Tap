[Spoken Intro]

[Hook]
I think a nigga phone tapped
Wanna give me time for my old raps
Indict me for my own raps
I think a nigga phone tapped
I think a nigga phone tapped
If you callin' me, I think your phone tapped
My phone tapped
Got a feelin' that my phone tapped

[Verse 1]
18 nigga wildin', trafficin' with a pilot
Crazy net worth, Miami bred the tyrants
First day of trial, courtroom was silent
Till the wiretap replayed back the dialect
Had tears in my eyes as you took your oath
Sweaty palms ainâ€™t for niggas who be touchin' dope
Aventadors, smell the Pyrex in the air
I'm dealin' raw, D-boys so debonair
In the barber shop, it's known that I can sell a pair
Count to forty-five before that man could shave his hair
Pistol underneath the apron as I'm in the chair
Raise it to my neck, I tip a hundred for the beard

[Hook]
I think a nigga phone tapped
Wanna give me time for my old raps
Indict me for my own raps
I think a nigga phone tapped
I think a nigga phone tapped
If you callin' me, I think your phone tapped
My phone tapped
Got a feelin' that my phone tapped

[Verse 2]
My right hand, I knew him since fourth grade
'88, afros with no fades
Fist fights, the box Chevys on blades
Chief all they gave us the rules to play
They trynna paint a picture of a hungry nigga
Another lion runnin' in the jungle with us
Told the bitches we was brothers, shared the same beeper
Introduce you to my mother, made sure you eatin'
Now you hangin' out with different people on the weekend
Quotin' different numbers nigga, like I wouldn't peep it
If it's war, here come murder, cause that come the cheapest
Call me on my sister phone, keep it on some G shit

[Hook]
I think a nigga phone tapped
They wanna give me time for my old raps
Indict me for my own raps
I think a nigga phone tapped
I think a nigga phone tapped
If you callin' me, I think your phone tapped
My phone tapped
Got a feelin' that my phone tapped

[Verse 3]
Niggas tellin' cause the jealous, look at what I'm wearin'
They want me in the prison when I'm just apparent
Quarter million in Atlanta, boy I had some talent
Throw a stack in Magic City, make a hater panic
305 nigga, ridin' in the Chevy
Count a half a milli in a couple seconds
Fuck two bitches then I want seconds
Richest nigga in the city, boy I broke some records
Puttin' spinners on your cars, suspendin' on the smoke
What your spendin' on your home, spendin' on the boat
Everybody watchin', everybody tellin'
When your days numbered, nigga, cherish every second

[Hook]
I think a nigga phone tapped
Wanna give me time for my old raps
Indict me for my own raps
I think a nigga phone tapped
I think a nigga phone tapped
If you callin' me, I think your phone tapped
My phone tapped
Got a feelin' that my phone tapped


[Outro: Bobbie Williams]
It's like, without, you know what I'm saying?
The foundation, dawg, there can never be no legacy
And you done set the foundation beyond the media, beyond the accusations
Beyond the idol decon
You know what I'm saying?
People tend to be my new-you know what i'm saying?
And my new speakers become vision haters, dawg
So no matter what obstacles comes your way
Like I told years ago, continue to emulate the great dawg
And continue to move forward, dawg
Cuz, you know what I'm saying, cuz your legacy becomes the hood legacy
The hood legacy is part of your legacy
And all the time I get all these questions everyday, "Man, Ross from the hood? Ross this?"
Ross is official. You know what I'm saying."
