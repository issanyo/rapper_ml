[Verse]
Rap game got me fucked up
Lord knows I'm a natural born hustler
Money came from customers
Niggas knew not to come at us
Paper long, we had to count with kilometers
Niggas started as a pharmacist
Witness, remain annoymous
'Cause you told me we had a partnership
Gave him my word, a bird and then return
He helped the people give my dog a long return
