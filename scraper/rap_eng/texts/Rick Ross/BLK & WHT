Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Mmm, hmm
Wanna gain it all, but you gon' lose your life
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Nigga crib so big, it's a damn shame
Nigga sellin' white for a gold chain

[Verse 1]
I've been trained to go since a young nigga stepped off the porch
Catch me in the kitchen, kilo, hey bring the fork
I've been tryna hold it down but these niggas livin' so fowl
Runnin' out on niggas intent of knockin' ya down
BANG! Your window shattered like it never mattered
You movin' weight, your pockets gettin' fatter
It's politics when it come to sticks
Ski mask and glove, nigga want a brick
My money funny, but you gotta love it
High heel thuggin' in Magic City, these bitches fuckin'
Your homie doin' taxes and they call it fraud
I'm in and out of traffic, still movin' hard

[Hook]
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Young nigga sittin' in the Benz and it's white on white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Young nigga sittin' in the Benz and it's white on white

[Verse 2]
Take a look at me, I'm trappin'
No excuses, I'm stackin', talkin' hundred on top of hundred
Them 100 makin' the magic blow
A hundred in a day, a hundred different ways
Rich nigga, bitch, put a hundred in my grave
Make my headstone read ''head of MMG''
That's another hundred mill, really, you can come and see
Forbes.com, I'm the Teflon Don
Too close to a nigga as a motherfuckin' bomb
Trayvon Martin, I'm never missin' my target
Bitch niggas hatin', tell me it's what I'm parkin'
Wingstop owner, lemon pepper aroma
Young black nigga, barely got a diploma

[Hook]
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Sittin' in the Phantom and it's white on white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Young nigga sittin' in the Benz and it's white on white

[Verse 3]
Showin' 'til the day I die, I'mma look up at the sky
Young trapstar, read, "The World is Mine"
Proceedin' with my grind like police is on my line
Instagrammin' shit for all the teachers I despised
Never saw my vision, you only saw me suspended
Now my white bitches be fuckin' me 'til I'm winded
Breathe. Breathe. Young nigga, breathe
If your ass wasn't rappin', what would you be?

[Hook]
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Hmmmm mmmm
Uuuuuuuuuuuu
White white white
Hmmmm mmmm
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Young nigga sittin' in the Benz and it's white on white
