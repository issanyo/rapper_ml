DJ Scream!
(Maybach music...)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Pimp C in my cassette deck
Pimp C in my cassette deck
I'm just wait too trill
I live way too trill
Born to hustle like I'm Chad Butler
And you know I keep a tall cup a'
Time to pop me a pill
I'm just way too trill
I'm ridin dirty in my Benzo
I'm pimpin women, I got ten hoes
Bumpin a "Pocket Full of Stones"
And you know I'm smoking strong
You know my partners put me on
I'm callin' Bun B on the phone
Cause my nigga so dope
And all my nigga sold dope
Huh!

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I ain't..it's something real
Someone feel the..
Pimp C in my cassette deck
I ain't..that's something real
Pimp C in my cassette deck
Someone feel..

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Pimp C in my cassette deck, bangin out of my head set
Talkin about some pussy that he left with it
And killed it like a death threat
This is the life of a jet set
But jazzy yella boppers that you just met
Bust it open and leave your bed wet
This is the life of a king
Money and power and jewelry that bling
Bitches that bathe you and kiss on your rings (they kiss on your rings?)
Amongst other things, we got cars that cost like a house
Houses that cost like a sub-division
Pitchin I see and I love the position
So know when you rep, this thug on a mission
I'm trillin than most, realer than all
Haters watchin but still I'm a ball
Put your name up with RIP on the wall
From gladiators that I kill if I call
We got work in the walls
The money is under the floor
And the guns in every room
And they light yo ass up if you come to the door
Better know PA is the town
Repping for life and I'm holding it down
Give a fuck if you like how it sound
Cause Port Arthur Texas ain't fucking around
So I'm coping my top leading my fifth poppin my trunk
Chucking the deuce while I'm sipping my juice
And I'm turning it up bitch I'm getting the crunk

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
Pimp C in my cassette deck, Cad' paint drippin wet
Hundred thou' on my neck, pay cash, no check
Rip microphones like I'm sweet James Jones
See, I can't believe that my nigga Pimp gone
Chrome spokes pokin' out the side of the Caddy
Keep a set of sexy yellas ridin with daddy
But it's for the money, never for the honey
I'm a trill nigga she can't get shit from me
I make them hoes pay me, pimpin bought me this Mercedes
Ever since I was a baby had them ladies going crazy
Ain't got a pimp cup but I got a sip cup
Doubled up muddy, full of that purple stuff
That Big Moe, that Pimp C, that DJ Screw, trill niggas feel me
And I'mma stay trill till a nigga kill me
Even after that I still be forever known trill

[Hook]
