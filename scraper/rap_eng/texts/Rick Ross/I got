"A little over a year ago I was in bondage
And now I'm back out here
Reaping the blessings and getting the benefits that go along with
Everything that's out here for kings like us
The reason why we like this, this jewelry and this diamonds and stuff
They don't understand is, because we really from Africa
And that's where all this stuff come from
And we originated from kings, you know what I'm saying so?
Don't look down on the youngsters because they wanna have shiny things
It's in our genes, know what I'm saying?
We just don't all know our history, so peace to the Midwest
Keep it P-I, you know what I'm saying?" (I'm a just keep you up on this pimp s***, see what I'm saying?)
I just landed in Europe, n****
Shopping bags, I'm a tourist, n****
Money talk I speak fluent, n****
Reeboks on, I just do it, n****
Look at me, I'm pure n****

Unfortunately I'm a pimp, baby
Couldn't care less 'bout your rent, lady
I got a chopper that's a bit crazy
Balenciaga boots, I'm in the Bent faded
Peelin' paper like a bank teller

Paper cuts until you hate cheddar

F*** around, my thang on me
Cell phone got 40 hoes
A-game give me 40 more
Her number keep on poppin' up

Got a bad b****, she a masterpiece
