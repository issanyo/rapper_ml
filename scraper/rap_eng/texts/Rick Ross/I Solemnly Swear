[Intro]
Rick Ross: Im not lying no more baby, Im through lying..
Girl: You promise?
Rick Ross: I swear, I swear. Baby no more lies, I solemnly swear, for real...
Girl: You said that last time!

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
They say I look nice in the mag
Plus the best on the cover(undercover)
Why it take a dopeboy to invest in a brother
It's time to wipe the tears of the face of our mothers
Sell a little base, appeal the case for my brothers
Fuck my problems for a second
Can I let my ace bubble?
She pressin in the club, in the presence of a thug
In need of satisfaction baby? I can be your plug
The boss talk slang, but I love to french kiss
Pour the money in the tub, so she call me filthy rich
Gotta send her shopping with at least a fifty clip
I'm way better than her last
Boy was a fan
Even had her blowing grass
Tell your friends you had a blast
Speedin' in the Spyker, she keep calling it a Jaq
I'm a superman, she call me I'll be there in a flash
I solemnly swear
With my hand on the bible
Big things, 10 million upon arrival

[Hook: Masspike Miles]
I said baby I got you
I solemnly swear I love you

I swear that love for you

I said no one else matters
I swear shit can only get better

I swear baby I got you

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Aromatherapy merry, she wanna marry me
I'm burning salary till the day they ready to burry me
7 feet
But I'm still in the paint
Like a nigga 7 feet
I'm Shaquille in the bank
I'm Jordan of the whips
Pippin of the pimpin
You're John Amaechi nigga, you a bitch among the bitches
Rollin' 50 deep, so now we clear and out the bleachers
Ron Artest, yes it's 50 for the features
Comma's like ??Adonis???..
Endorsing them Gucci sneakers
Pull up in the Porsche, off course I'm feelin' the speakers
Feelin like chillin', I'm billin', blowin' that reaver
Ho's feelin me, while ho's should fill in my visa
Call me Master P
Cuz it ain't no limit
I'm jumping like Spud Webb
Coach I gotta go get it
Trapping like running sprints
Catch your breath, count your chips
My lawyer Pat Riley
I needed a great defense!
I solemnly swear
Hand on the bible
NBA money, bonus upon arrival

[Hook: Masspike Miles]
I said baby I got you
I solemnly swear I love you

I swear that love for you

I said no one else matters
I swear shit can only get better

I swear baby I got you
