Lord forgive me for my sins
But may I strike down an get vengeance
Murder my homeboy, Why you doin like that
Niggas getting churched up, Time for the get back
Found him last night, four shots in his back
No leads to the case, Triple C's will handle that, Just bought a new swo?
In the streets im sworn
Its time for the murder ride, all on board
Give me them sticks, s-k, s-k's, m-11's

When tha hammer fall
Dats for the trigger pull
Another maggot falls
Split down in beu[?]
What do witness's witness?
Plus we handle my biznesss
Another clip of snitches
While they looking at bitches
Feel like im brainwashed
To finally [?]
Caught 8 bodys in four weeks im on fire
Cuz I want you to cry
Im killin your gleam
Im sending your team
They killin for me

Just like saddom Hussein
Just offered your head
Its on my camera phone
You can't picture me dead
Am I christian or muslim
Or just addicted to husslin
My daddy don't love me
Mama fightin an fussin
Now im choppin the rocks
Niggas pockets on sow ell
Man im pimpin them hoes
Givin the new pistols to hoes
Graduated from [?]
Rappin for waves of people

Ya I want you to cry , ya look at me cookin that ether
Rollin down your block, 3 deep , got my pistol in my lap
See me underneath the sink
I ain't come to die, I ain't come to talk , boy I came to see you cry
Let me see you off
Now cry, cry, cry, cry,cry, nigga cry, cry, cry

So we back in the game
Back on the dock
Port of miami, blood hound for the rock
Im getting that money
Niggas trackin to kill us
Get on my own killas
Get my own niggas to killem
Im spending new money
So don't bother my bitch
Im getting jewel money
You niggas ain't nigga rich

Im in the yacht
See me im talkin fifty feet
Don't talk cars, bitch I got fifty fleets
Im in the han ron?
Witnesses takin the fire
Ain't no snitchin my brother
Its called you takin the dive
They shootin at me, so im shootin at them
Im shootin the locus, im shootin to win

The winner is me, I want you to cry, I want you to scream , just want you to die
I want you to fly, I need a prayer, when im satisfied, just to live another day

Rollin down your block, 3 deep , got my pistol in my lap
See me underneath the sink
I ain't come to die, I ain't come to talk , boy I came to see you cry
Let me see you off
Now cry, cry, cry, cry,cry, nigga cry, cry, cry

Im mentioned for killin
Got your name on my list
Ya im bumpin your crib, im fuckin your bitch
I put her to sleep, then I think of myself
Call in evil things that I can do in my wealth
Is that a bitch, im getting work, I never spare a bitch
You getting murdered, in bloody gloves, with bloody shirt
Tiger in my eyes, bitch you know who done the dirt

When I left I had a whole hundred in the magizine
Now there none in the magizine
It was a guy so he died at least a hundred time
Looked him in his eyes right before I made him cry
