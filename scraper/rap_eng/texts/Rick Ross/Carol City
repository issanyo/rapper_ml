[Chorus]
Word to the pusher, nigga never kept a job
Boobie  gave me game, we used to sell dope and rob
I left a stain off in Carol City
My last name should be Carol City
Used to sell dope just to feed the fam
Matchbox jumping with the kilograms
I feel your pain if you from Carol City
My last name should be Carol City

[Verse 1]
Black Dollar, I wanna buy a house on every block
Build one bigger than Dolphin Stadium, young nigga watch
Captain Crabs AK shells, living your aftermath
Ain't no love, get your money or get a body bag
Hammers and vogues, 30s and lows
River City, Lake Lucerne ride clean for the deadliest hoes
Gotta represent, nigga so meet me at the mint
And if you living how I'm living, stay behind the tint
Marble floors, mink rugs and got the gold faucets
Be cautious, well known to take the weak hostage
U.S. Marshals on the way and they cut open the gates
Know we going to trial by the look on my face

[Chorus]
Word to the pusher, nigga never kept a job
Boobie gave me game, we used to sell dope and rob
I left a stain off in Carol City
My last name should be Carol City
Used to sell dope just to feed the fam
Matchbox jumping with the kilograms
I feel your pain if you from Carol City
My last name should be Carol City

[Verse 2]
Fake niggas found face down in abandoned buildings
Pinchin' pennies, fed cases get you a lengthy sentence
Niggas snitching, bitches switching is what I seen the most
3-0-5 but Carol City got the cleanest coke
Matchbox Projects, I gave my point of view
Bomb man, two lieutenant I was appointed to
60 thousand in nickel rocks outside the Silver Fox
Duval County to Virginia, my pockets 'bout to pop
Move 'em hoe, mind your business, therefore nobody told
And when they did, they come and get you, send you up the road
We met his kids fishing on the bridge
Ten years later, bumped into him, he threw me a brick

[Chorus]
Word to the pusher, nigga never kept a job
Boobie gave me game, we used to sell dope and rob
I left a stain off in Carol City
My last name should be Carol City
Used to sell dope just to feed the fam
Matchbox jumping with the kilograms
I feel your pain if you from Carol City
My last name should be Carol City

[Verse 3]
Walking home from school, always was quick to jump a nigga
Third day of school, they knew I was a thumper, nigga
My lil hitta doing 4, he caught a gun charge
Rolling boonk in Backwoods, they out of Bunche Park
Position yourself, it's timing that's coming to the hit
Caught him slippin' at Sherman’s, he tryin' to get a fit
It’s either or, baby boy, you can meet the Lord
I pray we meet again, maybe we be on one accord
Walking through the flea market, bouncing like I hit a lick
Go and open a record label just to go legit
At the car wash on 27th was a pastime
Pay for 60 keys all at once just like the last time

[Chorus]
Word to the pusher, nigga never kept a job
Boobie gave me game, we used to sell dope and rob
I left a stain off in Carol City
My last name should be Carol City
Used to sell dope just to feed the fam
Matchbox jumping with the kilograms
I feel your pain if you from Carol City
My last name should be Carol City
