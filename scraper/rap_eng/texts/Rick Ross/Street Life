[Hook: Lloyd]
Ain't nothin' but the street life
That's money, cars and hoes
It's the only life I chose
Street life, ain't nothin' but the street life
They love they way I shine
This world is mine, all mine

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Up early in the mornin', got gold in my eye
Got a .45 that'll leave a hole in the sky
Sittin' at this table, why to take a soul for a guy
Music and the street life that's a whole 'nother side
Hoes used to call me small time
My clothes ain't know what to call mine
No logos or no tags in it
No polos 'til I started baggin' it
Way before my first key
My nigga E showed me
How to parlay a Z, good lookin' nigga
I know my mama pullin' overtime
Pocket full of dimes
So I'm out here pullin' mine

[Hook: Lloyd]
Ain't nothin' but the street life
That's money, cars and hoes
It's the only life I chose
Street life, ain't nothin' but the street life
They love they way I shine
This world is mine, all mine

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
You can't close shop, not on my block
I'm 24/7 like IHOP
Came from the bottom to the skybox
Now a penthouse, you can call me Hi-Top
Hop up in the 40-40, got 'bout forty on me
Fifty grand in a band, I'mma roll it homie
Brick layin' cost 'bout another dub
Ten grand for a pound of the bubble bud
Twenty birds in a room down in Atlanta
I caught a bird, but the birds can't buy a camper
Just an example, by an ex-trapper
Dress the coupe in the shoes, now that's dapper

[Hook: Lloyd]
Ain't nothin' but the street life
That's money, cars and hoes
It's the only life I chose
Street life, ain't nothin' but the street life
They love they way I shine
This world is mine, all mine

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Street life, sellin' dope, fuckin' hoes
Big E, smoke comin' outta nigga nose
Candy paintin' on the corner, sellin' everythin'
I'm on the move, I ain't called mama in a couple days
This life and nothin' will ever change that
I love the game and we'll never give the game back
We lost a lotta good niggas in the game
But in the game, all the good niggas get a name
I got a name, everybody don't die the same
Like all dope don't fly the same
M-I-Yayo, boy I buy them thangs
It's like the people want me to come fly the plane

[Hook: Lloyd]
Ain't nothin' but the street life
That's money, cars and hoes
It's the only life I chose
Street life, ain't nothin' but the street life
They love they way I shine
This world is mine, all mine
Ain't nothin' but the street life
That's money, cars and hoes
It's the only life I chose
Street life, ain't nothin' but the street life
They love they way I shine
This world is mine, all mine
Ain't nothin' but the street life
That's money, cars and hoes
It's the only life I chose
Street life, ain't nothin' but the street life
They love they way I shine
This world is mine, all mine
