Yea, Red Rum
What’s happenin’ brah, trust nobody, we the best

[Hook]
Trust nobody, bitch, I’m ‘bout that drama
Takin’ over, nigga, say what you wanna
(nigga that’s on my momma)
Real ass nigga, only talk ‘bout commas
Signing off, nigga, young Obama
(nigga that’s on my momma)
I done hustled, hit the streets with that product
Went to jail, got indicted, homeboi
(nigga that’s on my momma)
Gave my life, I done came out the closet
Ain’t no rapper, and I’m more than the hottest
(nigga that’s on my momma)

[Verse 1]
I’ve never told, I’ve never fold, nigga never rat
I’m out the game, put in my notice, I ain’t comin’ back
I live my life, my family first, nigga fuck a trap
Shit got so bad, I even started sellin’ my baby crack
Grandma house getting kicked in every year
I hurt that lady, even caught my indictment there
Got to shootin’, cussin’, switches got to fightin’ there
Hot to work a nigga bitch, yea p-pushin’ rims
I’m the man, til that nigga got caught
Came home made me change my thoughts, yea
Either I do it big, or don’t do it at all
It’s hard to do it big behind them walls
And that’s real nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
ROSS
I look at life differently, show no sympathy
I’m a different breed, mama never christened me
Therefore eventually, hustlin’ consumed mentally
Collect calls from hustlas doin’ a century
She’s hummin on my balls, imitating a symphony
Asked me how long, I told that bitch, “eventually”
Red rims, red car
Red monkey, I’m a trap star
Red Rum, you better run
I keep that cow tech, ain’t no better gun
She a red bone, she love heels
With the red bottoms, told my life real

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I told my life, I kept it real, and got a check for it
I never quit, follow my dreams, and get respect for it
I be like fuck a hater, I mean that fuck a hater
I’m gettin’ money now, bitch I’ma kill you later
Rob my inspirator
Broke nigga motivator
Heavy weight a money maker
Ran fast, stay in shaper
Pancake bread baker
Never could keep a job
Man all I know is hard
Trap in whoever yard
Jump out task force
Duckin’ the game cops
Smoke good, slang rocks
Bitch, this the switchspot, yea
Can’t get no realer
Never was no killer
But bitch I been that nigga, yea

[Hook]
