[Intro]
Maybach music
Real shit right here
Shit
La musica de Harry Fraud
Let me come right back at these hoe niggas
Check me out

[Verse 1]
Shinin' like Sonny Liston, smokin' that Joe Frazier
Prophet like Muhammad, Abu Dhabi watchin' cable
You gangbangin', I'm dope dealin'
My chain swangin', I'm just a dope nigga
Magic bought the Dodgers, I just bought the projects
Broke down 100 bricks, same profit margin
'Nother day in the park, I just wanna play ball
Guess my gats and my drugs, is my bat and my glove
High as Darryl Strawberry in back of the club
Sorta Tommy Lasorda, most of my niggas is snorters
Keep a 40 bust a nigga, I dare you report it
Keep a 40 bust a nigga, I dare you report it

[Chorus]
I got a bitch right up the street that you don't know about
I see that other kinda money you don't know about
Been had a pad out in Cali that you don't know about
You amongst niggas and killers you don't know about

[Verse 2]
I plant the dynamite and then I push the detonator
Go get your money right, until then I ain't fuckin' with you
Five Jesus pieces but I think the devil got me
Knock a nigga off, get on the phone and laugh about it (ha ha)
Hoe niggas always talkin' in the past tense
Hate to see a young nigga live in these mansions
Hate to see a young nigga fuckin' these bad bitches
Fuck her from the back, I got that pussy ad-libing
Moral of the story, tell a story so terrific
Hit the fan, flip the script, shit could get horrific
What's your body count, nigga, I'm double digits
If your name get on this list, somebody gotta get it

[Hook]
I got a bitch right up the street that you don't know about
I see that other kinda money you don't know about
Been had a pad out in Cali that you don't know about
You amongst niggas and killers you don't know about
I got a bitch right up the street that you don't know about
I see that other kinda money you don't know about
Been had a pad out in Cali that you don't know about
You amongst niggas and killers you don't know about
