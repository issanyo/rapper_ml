"Come on let's pray: Dear Lord
Please forgive us for all the sins we have brought upon us
And look down upon us with forgiveness for all the sins we will have in the future
I know you understand that niggas ain't perfect, but we try, Lord
We try to keep our heads up in bad times
This is a bad time; show us the way
And if you can't show us the way
Then forgive us for being lost
