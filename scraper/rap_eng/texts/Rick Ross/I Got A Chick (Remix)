[Hook - Tyrese]
I got a chick that love
I got a chick that love me
And she’ll do anything for me
That’s why I fucks with her

[Verse 1 - Tyrese]
I fucks with her high
Call it my little ghetto sex soldier
She ain’t like them other chick
Got a nigga open like a fucking bag of chips
And she got enough respect
To make a nigga feel like a president
The best lover, shawty ain’t playin
Sex so good she’s just got me saying mam
I toast to the winner
She put it on me she’ll even bring a friend for me
That’s why I buy her everything
Cause she is the baddiest thing up in the club
[Hook - Tyrese]
I got a chick that love
I got a chick that love me
And she’ll do anything for me
That’s why I fucks with her

I ain’t gotta tell her but once
Whatever it is, she gonna do it
Like, ain't shit to it like
Don’t listen to the friends
No matter what they’re telling you
Should listen to her man
Cause we gonna ride forever
We be in the Phantom Ghost doing the most
Got a lot of haters jealous cause we still together
This right here is gonna last forever
It’s you and me together through the stormy weather, oooh
That’s why I buy her everything
Cause she is the baddiest thing up in the club

[Hook - Tyrese]
I got a chick that love
I got a chick that love me
And she’ll do anything for me
That’s why I fucks with her

[Verse 2 - Rick Ross]
It’s the slow love maker
Straight back breaker
Credit card swiper
Louboutin Nike her
Shoe game is immaculate
That other boy be lacking
Give you time to calculate
Cause fat boy always accurate
My appetite is sexual
Want to taste the best of you
Mr Screws, swimming pools full of revenue
Skipping school, schooling niggas to what cheddar do
Making moves, millionaire you woulda never knew
Cherry red Beamer riding with a tenderoni
Ballin all day at fuckin 5 in the morning
