[Verse 1: Game]
When I'm low ridin' with my bitch, oh, hit the switch, oh
Car gettin' hyphy, stunner shades on the '64
And my chick gold, look at my wrist glow
Is Jacob goin' to jail? Man, I don't know
Fluorescent lights, fluorescent ice
It's like Independence Day when I ride at night
It's like N.W.A when I ride in the day
My chest is cool and I'm cool as Dre
Nigga, I - make - hits
But we don't wear that Bape shit
My bandana red, it's Louis Vuitton
From out there, niggas can't tell it's Louis Vuitton
Come in here muhfucka where the weapons is drawn
The Cristal on ice and all the Henny is gone
And I still got five dimes on my arm
If that makes sense you gettin' warm, nigga you gettin' warned

[Hook (x2): Game]
Turn the lights off, turn the music up
I'll be there in the dark holdin' the speakers up
I will not stop, I can't be stopped
It ain't gon' stop till the music stops

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Fifteen with a ounce, holdin' a deuce-deuce
Burnin' green on a suit, just fiendin' for new shoes
Leaning on grey juice, it's better than Grey Goose
Beverly came through, I got head in the grey coupe
Grey rims hit the corner, I'm burning the California
A young Suge Knight but I'm stranded down in Florida
House on the water, pool on the roof
Got work in the crib, worth a million a two
My cars on the grass, banks for the cash
Hit Chi-town, the wild honeys see the tags
I will not stop pullin' out knots
20's at the bottom, keep the 100's on the top
For, five, six hey Crack, let's get it
Forty-five bricks, beat the case, we did it

[Hook (x2): Game]
Turn the lights off, turn the music up
I'll be there in the dark holdin' the speakers up
I will not stop, I can't be stopped
It ain't gon' stop till the music stops

[Verse 3: Game]
I'm in the 'hood with the speakers on blast like
When the Lambo pass
I came, I saw, I drove it away
Drove it through L.A. till niggas thought it was Dre
Bangin' Murcielago with the butterfly dohs
L.A. on my face like where the butterfly go
It disappeared cos I'm David Blaine
Niggas close they eyes and I change my chains
I walked into Jacob with a hundred thou
Next day, took the shit off and threw it in the crowd
So if you at a concert screamin' my name
Throw up a dub and you just might catch my chain

[Hook (x2): Game]
Turn the lights off, turn the music up
I'll be there in the dark holdin' the speakers up
I will not stop, I can't be stopped
It ain't gon' stop till the music stops
