[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Crack cocaine man thats no thang
Choppin on them boulders with big boulders on my ring
Bubbles in yalls cookies
Yall niggas some rookies
Mutha fuck the police I'm a sell it till I sold it
I'll slap you like you stole it if you owe it clear ya tab
Or feel the 47 ak don't even ask
Bitch I'm out that gutta

Bitch I'm bout that border
All my toys make noise

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I'm going deep
I'm going deep
I'm going deep

We going deep

I'm thinkin status
I'm thinkin power
Gettin cabbage, livin lavish
No room for cowards
What's yo desire
Is it paper or is it pussy
Either way these niggas hatas
And I got em lookin
Aston Martins and them Phantoms
They all on the grass
Helicopters over here
Them crackas on our ass
They wanna see the Triple C
Underneath the sea
Because I got cars and cycles
Cocksucker they just increased
So fuck your gossip
Cause my profit is just so colossal
Silver Murcielago, 30 other auto's
You niggas better follow

[Hook]
