[Hook: JR Castro]
Soon as I get home, I'll be fucking you
Assume the position baby
Soon as I get home, I'll be fucking you
Go on and spread 'em baby

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
You know I'ma hit it right, say she got a leak so I hit her with the pipe
Sub tweeting cause I hit her with a like, she my dub-cee-dub every Wednesday night
I know you sitting by your iPhone, with nothing but my ice on
She let me eat it with my grill in, and tell me never turn the lights off
Skirt through the light, gone
But you know how to ride slow when you with Mr. K-I-D-I-N-K
Know I done spent all night try'na fight through the hoes cause

[Hook: JR Castro]
Soon as I get home, I'll be fucking you
Assume the position baby
Soon as I get home, I'll be fucking you
Go on and spread 'em baby

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
She telling me I need to change
But baby I need the change
Two coupes, two bricks, life too short
Cocktail, two Glocks, and a newport
I put my money where my mouth is
Number one anywhere the south is
Rich niggas you could tell by the outfits
High top Versace I'm about that boss shit
Counting cash on the tarmac
For you new niggas got to run the carfax
Them numbers don't match
She telling me this money won't last

[Hook: JR Castro]
Soon as I get home, I'll be fucking you
Assume the position baby
Soon as I get home, I'll be fucking you
Go on and spread 'em baby
