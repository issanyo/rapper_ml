[Chorus: Young Breed]
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
Boosie, Bad Azz...
Bid'ness one... we gon' make these niggas lay it down
One by one, two by two, three by three, four by four
Fuck nigga, fuck nigga, fuck nigga; Bad Azz
I will lay it down (what?), Boosie goin' be playin' around
Boosie ain't got time for that, Boosie push your wig back
Boosie, here, take that; your chain and your braclet
Half my clique jack boys, they run off and attack boys
Turn niggas to track stars, when we get thirsty
We have these niggas running like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
You just started sipping lean, I'll take your purple drink
If I fall off again mayne, I'm runnin in the bank
You know I stay about that jacking, killing, robbing, and thugging
Whip ya head like cee-lo, slap ya like D-Bo
Go in his pocket, go in his drawers, go in his watch
Fetti Fetti mayne, told ya it's a recession mayne

[Chorus: Young Breed]
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Soulja Slim (hah!) Lil Snupe, Lil Phat
All black hoodie, Trayvon Martin nigga
Put a hundred grand on Trayvon Martin's killer
Set a hundred down, you can come and get it
Murder Zimmerman in the middle of the city
Bounce, I remember tryin' to flip an ounce, hah
Sleepin on my baby mama's couch, whoa
What you pussy niggas talkin' 'bout?
No, puttin choppas, corpses hangin out
Tell them haters wanna climb aboard
Cause this ain't what the fuck you lookin' for?
Ridin roll's royce through the fifth ward
Fuck a rap song, still I could flip hard

[Chorus: Young Breed]
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down

[Verse 3: Young Breed]
Lay it down nigga; Self Made shit
Ay, I draw that attention, you know what's happenin'
If I stumble across a brick, Lord be my shepherd (lord)
If a nigga try to take it better pray the Lord bless him
Trap house street nigga we'll bear wheat witcha
Work by the boatload, get it by the cheap, nigga
Lay a nigga down like I'm layin' towel
Got a killer, ain't no, makin' trial
Bitch you know I got the and one makin' fouls
Ain't no hatin', wait till I move this 80 pounds
Ridin 36 O's like a bus nigga
Just a trafficker I'mma need a truck, nigga
Cause in the dope hole, it's just us nigga
Keep the choppa on me, I don't really trust niggas

[Chorus: Young Breed]
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, fuck nigga lay it down
