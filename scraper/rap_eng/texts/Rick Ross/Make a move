[Verse 1: Rick Ro$$]
I needs a real bitch, 365
Let her count the cheese let her see the pies
Might say I'm foolish but we have a bond
She make moves on my behalf when I had no bond
All the death threats 'cause I owed niggas
She told me get rest, those are hoe niggas
That's a real bitch she had to show niggas
'Cause I was blind to the fact she was a hoe, nigga
I'm countin' dough, nigga she'll double count
Somethin' come up short she'll point it out
Niggas try to holla she'll point it out
She'll catch a flight she'll run a route

[Hook: Rick Ro$$] + (Ebony Love)
We got grands in this bitch, girl come & get you some
(Money Make Me Come, Money, Money Make Me Come
Money Make Me Come, Money, Money Make Me Come
Money Make Me Come, Money, Money Make Me Come)

[Verse 2: Rick Ro$$]
She a real bitch so she gotta stunt
She get her weave done at least 5 times a month
She don't call 'em purses, bitch call 'em bags
I don't know the names I know they cost some stacks
She deserves this she serves her purpose
She saves her juice box 'til it looks perfect
Fuck the Aston Mar, fuck wit a astronaut
I'm in the gulf stream nuts in my ashy watch
I needs a real bitch, I needs a real bitch
Ass like Trina & the brains is the business
I needs a real bitch she get you what you need
She get you what you want she'll even roll your...

[Hook: Rick Ro$$] + (EbonyLove)
We got grands in this bitch, girl come & get you some
(Money Make Me Come, Money, Money Make Me Come
Money Make Me Come, Money, Money Make Me Come
Money Make Me Come, Money, Money Make Me Come)

[Verse 3: Rick Ro$$]
I needs a real bitch 365
Let her count the cheese can't believe her eyes
Might say I'm foolish but we have a bond
She make moves on my behalf when I had no bond
Cop the big range let her move in it
The condo round the corner with all the tools in it
Take her 2 minutes she'll be there & back
So when you see that pretty face you better lay it flat

[Hook: Rick Ro$$] + (EbonyLove)
We got grands in this bitch, girl come & get you some
(Money Make Me Come, Money, Money Make Me Come
Money Make Me Come, Money, Money Make Me Come
Money Make Me Come, Money, Money Make Me Come)
