[Hook: Mariah]
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
They told me get 'em, I got 'em
I swear this word to my father
And the only way to make it to the top
If you go and get it from the bottom
And I have never asked for no hand outs
You won’t carry me, no Mariah
These haters love when I was dead broke
But they are not mad at me
I’m on fire and I’m going to burn
And I am not going to learn
I remember they said that it is not my turn
But it is not confirmed, then the tables turned
Just look at me now, try to hold me down
But I am not going to stop, because I’m going to climb
To the mountain top, to the mountain top, now let go

[Chorus: Mariah]
Can’t fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Path that I chose flashing camera’s as I pose
Throwing big money as she dances on the pole
Lime green Lamborghini dances in the road
License still suspended, no I never stop for tolls
Born slick talker, twice a week shopper
Blow a hundred racks she don’t know a footlocker
Red bottom boss house big as Baltimore
With a blonde bombshell trying to bomb with your boy
In the James Bond Beamer chrome wheel two seater
Smoking like Pimp C, spoken like a trill nigga
On a cloudy day baby I can make it rain
Rubber band, 50 grand bet it brighten up your day
Came from humble beginnings
Then was Hummers and Benzes
Now it’s hundred and millions this is only the beginning
A don, a diva, the bomb achiever
The one believer, the game gets deeper

[Chorus: Mariah]
Can’t fall down stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down

[Hook: Mariah]
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)

[Bridge: Mariah]
Can’t fall down now, so even when clouds surround you
And everyone seems to doubt you
Baby, still know who you are
So you got to keep on climbing
In spite of the chains that bind you
You can see the mountain top
It’s not too far

[Chorus: Mariah]
Can’t fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toe, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down
Can’t fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toe, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down

[Outro]
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
