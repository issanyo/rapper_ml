[Intro: Rick Ross]
Ricky Rozay aka Pharaoh Dinero
Mauricio, I got this, nigga, sit back

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
A.I. on the crossover
Name a nigga floss more
The crib worth 30
The record label burnin'
Hottest team on the turf
Fat Trel, put in work
Trill nigga still on the rise
Throwback, black Karl Kani
Got these sticks back in '96
Cocaine cowboy, howdy howdy, bitch
Trappin' so long 'til it's in the pores
Made a hundred racks before you hit the chorus
Maybach, 5 lives in the Taurus
Niggas froze up when they saw us
We the ones started out the poets
Poor student, natural born poet

[Hook: Troy Ave]
Blue SL, got the centerfold
Sittin' passenger, got a centerfold
New model Benz, new model bitch
We just livin' life, dope dealer rich
Who got it? We got it
Who done it? We did it
One hunnid, we livin'
Get money, do business
Real niggas love me, fake niggas hate me
I'm still in the streets eatin', paper plates

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
The chopper make a nigga Milly Rock
I'm tryna buy the whole city block
I got fed allegations, nigga
And you a mothafuckin' city cop
Mauricio! Let the beat drop
I'ma Smurda dance till the Lamborghini lot
SKRRRRT! Closed lips, we don't talk a lot
Nigga used to whip it out the coffee pot
Can't remove black youngster
This money turned a nigga to a monster, I am
I got the game from my mama
Hundred round, nigga I'm the drummer
Battle of the bands
I'll never take the stance
Told you niggas I'm a general
Got the soldiers on command

[Hook: Troy Ave]
Blue SL, got the centerfold
Sittin' passenger, got a centerfold
New model Benz, new model bitch
We just livin' life, dope dealer rich
Who got it? We got it
Who done it? We did it
One hunnid, we livin'
Get money, do business
Real niggas love me, fake niggas hate me
I'm still in the streets eatin', paper plates

[Verse 3: Troy Ave]
Dope boy Troy, you ain't nothin' like me
I buy a pack of white tees and pack some white keys (coke!)
One when it's hot, one in the pot, sizzle
You can find either one in the drop, riddle
I just bought a Benz with the price of Lamb'
But show the new 'Rari, I was like, "Damn!"
I could fuck up the hood, they won't understand
Backdoor, the feds might come for a nigga, man
I'ma do it, fuck it, I'ma do it
I just had a half a million and I ran through it
350 on my condo, I paid cash
A hundred on the car, another 50 just for laughs
Hahahahaha I'm laughin' straight to the bank
And I don't give a fuck what a pussy nigga think
And I will shoot a nigga dead if they even fuckin' blink
I'm the wrong one, but the right one to get you play

[Hook: Troy Ave]
Blue SL, got the centerfold
Sittin' passenger, got a centerfold
New model Benz, new model bitch
We just livin' life, dope dealer rich
Who got it? We got it
Who done it? We did it
One hunnid, we livin'
Get money, do business
Real niggas love me, fake niggas hate me
I'm still in the streets eatin', paper plates

[Outro: Yo Gotti]
All gas, no brakes
All gas, no brakes
All gas, no brakes
All gas, no brakes
All gas, no brakes
All gas, no brakes
All gas, no brakes
All gas, no brakes
