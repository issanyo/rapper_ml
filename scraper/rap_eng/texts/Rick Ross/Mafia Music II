[Rick Ross]
Kilograms were the key to my success
I apologize being so discreet with my connects
Lamborghinis were figments of my imagination
Whoever figured the figures this figure would be making
Plenty cream my women pose like figurines
Whips weaving through traffic the triple black centipedes
Oh please let a nigga breathe
Dilated pupils are the seeds of a niggas greed
With 20 g's in my denim jeans
If she fucking me she lucky just to get some Chuck E. Cheese
I bust my nut and holla lucky me
Its tatted in my vein I remain sucker free
My vocal like an atom bomb in the Avalon
Black roses for singing the saddest song
As Salamu Alaykum to paper
Walaikum Salam
Im the don inshallah, now pour me my Dom
Being gangstas a cold job
Wack a nigga go rejoice with a blow job
Always wanted Rolls Royce with no job
Then again all I fear is a dope charge
All I fear is a dope charge
Tell me whats the odds for appeals for a dope boy
Who shed tears for a dope boy
Oh what happens to the kids of the dope boy
Orphans, fucking orphans
Born defending some nigga never been on offence
Now its shrimp, order more shrimp
My neighbourhood a rackett I practice my importance
You know we hustle to the key of life
Moving weed and white before we learn to read and write
So fuck a tutor pay attention to my shooter
Fucking me today but next she be fucking Luda
We assholes with fast cars and cash flow
My last load was gift wrapped by Castro
I did it all but the blow was my specialty
Mental telepathy directly in my recipe
Ahh, 2 mill on my second home
Still stepping on a couple bricks of that methadone
I got a method for getting money like RZA do
Resurrected Big Poppa in the physical
Reincarnated the realest I'm getting revenue
10 mill borrowed from my peers in the federal
And thats several for slinging in Atlanta
But the way they dress you never knew
Thought they seen a better view
But the feds had a rat named Reginald
That put em on a pedestal the conviction was incredible
The moral of the story was
Ain't no happy ending for a thug
I think of 2Pac, I think of Biggie now
Look how they getting down, I went and bought a 50 Cal
We all go when we gotta go
My Glock hole bigger than Nicki Minaj camel toe
So let the panel know we back, the commission intact
Teflon Don in all black fulfilling contracts
I'm only here to supersede my successors
RIP Paul Castellano, Myer Lansky, Bumpy Johnson, Al Capone
T-Roger, Tookie Williams, Carlo Gambino and last but not least John Gotti
Teflon Don
