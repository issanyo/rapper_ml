[Chorus]
I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone
I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone
He want a quote, he talking 9 zones
He bought four, I front him 5 more
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Suave house, still independent
Distribution Mexican, he still sending
No contract, take my word
Send a hundred packs bitch, them my birds
Shoe box, no shoes in 'em
In the two seater, me and two women
No Def Jam, went solo
Took the custies prices solo

[Chorus]
I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone
I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone
He want a quote, he talking 9 zones
He bought four, I front him 5 more
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls

[Verse 2: T.I.]
It's the king young gunner
Hotter than a sauna in the summer
Nigga think I'm playing round if you wanna
Bring the thunder and the lightening
Like a sighting if you try me
On my Warren Buffet shit
That monkey shit behind me
You want a square, nigga, you know where to find me
Don't call me on my cell
You tryna send a pimp to jail
If you buying 25 you can get it for the twelve
Uncut, rocked up, got tan and pale yeah
Hey let me send a little message to my enemies
You nigga get to telling have 'em buried 'fore they sentence me
Come to ATL, hit any trap bet they remember me
Billionaire swag with a dope boys energy

[Chorus]
I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone
I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone
He want a quote, he talking 9 zones
He bought four, I front him 5 more
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Soft white, I got that G-mix
I'm going Gold, crumbs to the bricks
I'm on the road, lets buy some new whips
Trick a hundred hoes, spend a few chips
9 piece, straight 8 balls
Bitch I'm blowing up like Napalm
Got your bottom bitch going AWOL
Nigga's looking at ya like you fell off
No sir, not me
I'm double platinum just like my Ferrari
Bullet proof, nigga, Teflon
Why you snorting that, that shit stepped on

[Chorus]
I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone
I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone
He want a quote, he talking 9 zones
He bought four, I front him 5 more
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls
