[Intro: Lyfe Jennings & (Rick Ross)]
It's my time (Rick Ross)
It's my time (Finna lay back on this shit man)
(Dade County dope boy)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm not a slim thug, I'm a fat mack
I don't give a fuck, I'll push ya hat back
Still sellin' dubs, nigga, that's fact
You can hit me on the cell pimp, that's that
I had to pawn my chain and grab a half ounce
Ten years later time for me to cash out
You dealin' with a dope dealin' dictator
Fuck traffickin' nigga, I get this shit catered
See the clip tailored, only the Coogi shit
I fucks with Damon, I'm in the movies kid
My mom reminisce on the late nights
When I used to reel 'em in with the straight white
'96, Seventeen with a lil' Beamer
First foreign car far from a lil' dreamer
Daddy severed his relationships
I think momma quit him cause he wasn't makin' shit
Who ever thought that I'd make it rich?
The bottom of a barrel, with a bucket of Crys'
I'm tellin' you man, life a funny thing
You ain't a dope boy 'til yo ass got a gun and chain

[Hook: Lyfe Jennings]
It's my time (It's my time, yeah, oh)
It's my time (I'm gonna shine, I'm gonna shine)
It's my time

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Ain't rappin', I'm talkin', ain't talkin', I'm scrappin'
Ain't scrappin', I'm shootin', they just askin' what happened
Ain't shoot then I'm shot, ain't shot then I'm shootin'
I ain't caught by the cops, fuck the cops I'm eluding
Ain't hearin' the sirens, but I'm seeing the sirens
Ain't seein' the sirens, why am I being so violent?
That's in the nature of being a nigga
Bein' beat down, then able to get up
Bein' let down, then able to sit up
Be the false charge, a nigga acquit it
I ain't hatin' on ya, dog I pray for ya
Be safe, I heard they got a case for ya
Be straight, stay away from them fake lawyers
You'll be workin' for the state like you they lawyer
Stay loyal, your time will come
For you to be free and shine like the sun
I'm so blessed, to be in this position
Holdin' on my .45, listenin' to every whisper
I'm so blessed, to be in this position
Holdin' on my .45, listenin' to every whisper

[Hook: Lyfe Jennings]
It's my time (It's my time, yeah, oh)
It's my time (I'm gonna shine, I'm gonna shine)
It's my time

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Other niggas sleep, I'm on my job
Soon as cats get 'laxed, I'm goin' hard
That's the rules of the game for the underdog
Ever wonder dog, long as I been goin' off? (Ross!)
I left it in Gods hands
Block told me once, "Ross, this is God's plan"
I'm like "Aw, man", a man run a label like "Amen"
Sign a Ray Charles, I could see it all
A lot of undercover agents wanna see me fall
See me fell, in the hell of shells
Expired, no liar, I live the tale
I look forward to workin' with all the real niggas
I look forward to lookin' back on drug dealin'
I look forward to makin' my momma smile once
Look forward, just know I'm smokin' them loud blunts
Eight-hundred an ounce, while you runnin' ya mouth
I'm loadin' the guns, who runnin' the South?
I'm on ya porch, knockin' at ya front door
I got my money right nigga, and I want war

[Hook: Lyfe Jennings]
It's my time (It's my time, yeah, oh)
It's my time (I'm gonna shine, I'm gonna shine)
It's my time (Yeah... yeah... yeaaah)
It's my time (There'll be no stopping me!)
(There'll be no stopping me now)
