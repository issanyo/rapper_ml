[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I walk streets, speak brief to key piece
[?] y’all knee deep in the streets
Sweet lord show me a sign and close when I open my eyes I’m hoping to find what’s rightfully mine
Serenity and respect being the man of color
When addressed, most politicians ran for cover
We don’t come out to vote, we’ll run ‘round with coke in the projects’ third floor gun ’round with coke
Hustlers ballin' whore, showin' these watchin' so as a revolving door we saw it all before
Neighbors don’t speak shit, they all at war
And in the gutta my nigga, that’s all it was
I’m praying for an angel that can absorb the blood
I’m praying for an angel that can absorb the slug
I’m waiting for the blessings, just show me some love
When my daddy died, I came close to not giving a FUCK!

[Interlude]
If ye be willing an obedient
Ye should eat the good of the lamb
But if ye refuse and rebel
Ye should be devoured with the sword
For the mouth of the lord have spoken it

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
What I did last night, lord, forgive me for that shit
But that 9 to five gig won’t get that Benz
That 9 to five gig won’t get that boat
That 9 to five gig don’t impress these hoes
Cuz a real bitch is not impressed by clothes
She’ll fuck you for free, depending on what you know, what you roll
Some back to the root, the dough baby
Homeboys know the hoes come before the dough baby
I’m ask em all, my passion to ball
To fraction ya all, caskets fall, practice the law flashin the fall eat on my necks if yours
And small jobs to the clean work for once
A dirty nigga wearing a clean shirt, it feels nice
Got the Cubans on hold
While Tony ? wash money
Turn the booth into the block
Rappers got Glocks for me
BANG! [Shots Fired]

[Interlude]
The lord is my light and my salvation
Whom shall I fear?
When my enemies and foes came upon me to eat my flesh, they stumbled, and failed

[Verse 3: Scarface]
You see God sees it all
Now I wonder if God liked if he let this Jews get away with the murder of Christ
Is the God you’re praying to the same God cuz mine ain't white
With a chokehold on niggas in charge of all lightness
Have faith for ass nigga, I’m all prayed out
Got scarred up knees and I live in a crackhouse
Funny how people use their religion to fuck with bitches
Boys get molested inside the church by Archbishops
Preachers turn into faggots
And in the club gettin’ lapdances
Bible contradicts, hands to the last chances
You give your life to God, you’ll be forgiven for that
The muslims fucked around and went to prison for that
I guess the point I’m trynna make is if you’re white you’re alright
All the other colors they try to muscle motherfuckers
With that made up shit, that they fuck with
As far as I’m concerned [?] can get the duck sick

[Scarface talking]
All I need is one mic, one church, one God, one life, light
And I ain’t preaching for no salary
I don't need no salary
Selling the word nigga!

[Outro:]
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
From that is the kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever
Amen
