I just landed in Mobay nigguh (Montego Bay)
No need for bags I'm a local nigga (Coral Gardens)
Doctor said to stay off my feet
But i caved in and walked to the beach (Get it)

I'm on the sand tryna think of a plan
To turn one Manley to a million men (Micheal!)
'Fuck I'm on I did that all ready
Now i need the same for Benji and Betty (Franklin and The Queen)

I just flew in from NY (The City of Dreams)
You need currency to live this Jet Life
I told my mum i wanna be a spitta
She said do your thing with a circle winners

[Hook: Rick Ross]

Fuck with me, you know I got it
Fuck with me, you know I got it
Sexy bitch I hope she 'bout it
Come fuck with me, you know I got it

I just came back from Florida nigga
No shopping bags I ain't a tourist nigga
American Eagle all on my shirt, you haters mad & I can smell the hurt
Yo bitch on board and she can’t find her skirt (uh)
Deep breaths ho gimme da throat (uh)
Breast stroke bitch rock the boat (uh)
Mass attack I’ll break ya back, she had a man and she ain't taking him back
Matters of fact, stand straight ho, mayne you with the gang
London bwoy dem hangers bang, ask Lumos he got the slang, got the slang
Fuck wit us you know we got it, got it!

[Tazz V3]
You know we got it
Only with a bitch if I know she bout it
Few hoes got disposed, Tongue quicker than the facts they ain't really got no damn loyalty at all
People wanna hype you up just to see you fall
And blood don't mean a god damn thing at all
Trust none my nigga
Wrap it up and get funds my nigga
Thats the life we live in
Entice these women 
That you might just swim in
In your light-less visions just pipe these bitches
And you might start winning before your life start dimming
Gimmicks, yea man they always around shit
What you go do get a pound of the loud shit
Round spliff round trip 
Lotto money count shit
Bitch niggas save hoes staying on that count shit
Cape on? Fuck dat!
Hoes in abundance 
Low eyes and you know that run rap
Mobay hip hop, yea we run that
Fuck with me you know I got it
