[Hook]
Bitch, I'm back, bitch, I'm back
That's what these motherfuckers saying: bitch, I'm back
Real talk is here, I don't think I should leave it
In fucking dirt of the trap and let you be my damn critics
My life is great, I don't have any babies
Because my bitch is a cannibal, nigga, I am the greatest
That mean I can't be wack, can't be wack
That's what these motherfuckers saying: bitch, I'm back

[Verse 1]
Guns come out, that mean K-RaT is back
Bring my motherfucking bitch, I need someone to smack
Fuck the rapid raps, I need you to understand
The mumble rap is coming to its end, it's fucking wack
It's not Tech N9ne debut album, it's the storm before calm
Confident motherfucker, there's the sweat on your palms
Fuck them Japanese niggas, they never seen real bombs
I keep riding on beats, this my own Vietnam
Pass me the fucking sriracha, I put that shit on your mom
She scream so loud like I'm Marshall and she's a Timberlake fan
These niggas call me a killer but I'm just student of game
All these MCs are my mentors, but I won't say any names
Except the name of a nigga you heard before couple times
His name is Mr. motherfucking Krane, he's not very nice
He's just a motherfucking rapper that is tired of the clowns
The new takeover is coming, somebody give me my crown and say it

[Hook]
Bitch, I'm back, bitch, I'm back
That's what these motherfuckers saying: bitch, I'm back
Real talk is here, I don't think I should leave it
In fucking dirt of the trap and let you be my damn critics
My life is great, I don't have any babies
Because my bitch is a cannibal, nigga, I am the greatest
That mean I can't be wack, can't be wack
That's what these motherfuckers saying: bitch, I'm back

[Verse 2]
Yo, how the fuck am I supposed to start the verse number two?
You know it can't be better, sequels always suck it, my dude
Fuck being constantly metaphysical, killing with wordplay
Kick the fuck back, relax and think about your road to the damn fame
I really don't know what to say, I think I have killed it
But what the fuck to do with this ox? I done already milked it
Light absinthe with unfiltered cigarettes, let Yelawolf hate me
Because of stealing a bar and raising it higher than Shady
Oh, fuck, another namedropping, but fuck it, pull my dick out
I got a question, motherfucker, keep your tongue in your mouth
What may unite different rappers like Tyga, me and 2Pac?
The fucking answer is simple as math: we don't give a fuck!
I'm going max, got me knocking fuckers on they back
In these cells, raising hell, tryna get back to the trap
But don't ever get it twisted, it's K-RZA spitting facts
Plus somebody said they seen it and they mean it
So they steady screaming

[Hook]
Bitch, I'm back, bitch, I'm back
That's what these motherfuckers saying: bitch, I'm back
Real talk is here, I don't think I should leave it
In fucking dirt of the trap and let you be my damn critics
My life is great, I don't have any babies
Because my bitch is a cannibal, nigga, I am the greatest
That mean I can't be wack, can't be wack
That's what these motherfuckers saying: bitch, I'm back
