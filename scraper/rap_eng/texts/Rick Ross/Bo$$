[Verse 1: Omarion]
They lookin' at you, standing next to me
The closest to perfection, some might ever see
Girl they know, to look this good it probably took some time
So all these bottles won't stop coming even when they close this bar tonight

[Pre-Hook: Omarion]
That you ain't gotta ever leave
Cause baby you here with me
You ain't gotta ever go
You can tell em if they wanna know
That if anybody wanna know

[Hook: Omarion]
You with a boss mah'fucker
You with a boss mah'fucker
You with a boss mah'fucker
You can tell em if they wanna know
If they ask you can let it go
Tell em I'm a boss mah'fucker

[Verse 2: Omarion]
Ever seen a presidential suite before?
So come on in, in the mornin'
I be John and you be Marilyn Monroe
It's the way i see ya baby girl you're legendary beautiful
And as long as you're around me baby girl then everyone else will know

[Pre-Hook: Omarion]
That you ain't gotta ever leave
Cause baby you here with me
You ain't gotta ever go
You can tell em if they wanna know
That if anybody wanna know

[Breakdown: Omarian & Rick Ross]
When you with me you know you fuckin' with a boss
You ain't gotta leave when you're fuckin' with a boss
Everything free when you fuckin' with a boss
When you with me you know you fuckin' with a boss
I'm a boss mah'fucker

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Flown with a bad one, time for some action
Safe combination, keys to the mansion
Still a hood nigga, flight reservations
Blowin' out your candles, fat boy straight cakin'
She deserve a real one
Now you fuckin' with a real one
Walk with a real one
This a whole 'nother feelin'
Then we fuck like we both mad
Better than we ever both had
She can see through my soul
Know when I'm creepin' with these hoes
Forgiatos on the Vette
First and last name on the check
48 laws of power
Shawty, the world is ours

[Hook: Omarian]
You with a boss mah'fucker
You with a boss mah'fucker
You with a boss mah'fucker
You can tell em if they wanna know
If they ask you can let it go
Tell em I'm a boss mah'fucker
