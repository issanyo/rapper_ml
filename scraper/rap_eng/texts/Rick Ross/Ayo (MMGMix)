[Intro]
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Rick Ross]
We poppin' like ayo
All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down
Screaming like ayo
I'mma take her ass down when she bring her friend around
Fuck ‘em both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga, left the roof at home
We popping like ayo, ayo, ayo
But don't be acting like I need you
It's Ricky Ross
Just checking in with my little homies
Chris, Ty what it do

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
New money, new year, it's time to boss up
Dm a couple bitches just to toss up (Uh)
Chick smiling cause she know she want the whole clique (Woo)
We show each other, then she send us all the same pic
Money lost, we got a thermal and a celly on
Let me shoutout these two niggas on another song
It's for my homies, yeah the ones who never coming home
I gave my chain to your son, I stay forever loyal
New crib on the water, you should see it nigga
40 bitches in the crib, top tier nigga
Chanel bags on the first day
We go and get it in the worst way

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We poppin' like ayo
All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down
Screaming like ayo
I'mma take her ass down when she bring her friend around
Fuck ‘em both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga, left the roof at home
We popping like ayo, ayo, ayo
But don't be acting like I need you

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ah, ay babe, this my new shit
I'm the black Richie Rich with the roof missing
If it don't make dollars, don't make sense
Z, wake up like I gotta get it
And I got an engine full of trunk space
I get money three ways, fucking bitches three ways
7 different foreigns plus she no hablé
But I make that bitch walk for some cheesecake
Yeah, I'm the coldest nigga, icy
Looking in the mirror like I wish I can be me
She too into me, I'm more into money
My hobby's her body, that pussy's my lobby
I'ma eat it, I'mma eat it
I don't lie, hold my dick, too conceited
Uh, told her she's my wife for the weekend
But don't be acting like I need you cause we poppin' like

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We poppin' like ayo
All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down
Screaming like ayo
I'mma take her ass down when she bring her friend around
Fuck ‘em both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga, left the roof at home
We popping like ayo, ayo, ayo
But don't be acting like I need you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I'm in a Rolls, you don't roll right
My chain shine brighter than a strobe light
I'm tryna fuck Coco, this don't concern Ice
If I motorboat, she gon' motorbike
A nigga ain't worried about nothin'
Rehabilitation just had me worried about fucking
Money, decision-making only worried about stunting
She worried about me, her nigga worried about cuffing
I wanna see her body (bodyyyy)
She said get inside of me
I wanna feel you baby (yeahhh)
Just bring the animal right out of me
We loving, she love it
Specially when I go down on her
Now we fucking, she thugging
Getting loud (cause we poppin' like)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We poppin' like ayo
All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down
Screaming like ayo
I'mma take her ass down when she bring her friend around
Fuck ‘em both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga, left the roof at home
We popping like ayo, ayo, ayo
But don't be acting like I need you

[Verse 4: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Huh, look, alright, now I can spot your bitch from a mile away
Valentine in that pussy, it's a holiday
Uh, you losing money, I win mills, Dr. J
She gon' to follow my lead, Simon Says
Paper, paper, I'm riding 'scrapers in California
Car smelling like ammonia, we got that stank on us
Never been an Outkast that stank on ya
From the ghetto but my bitch like Apollonia
We in the hood, tatted like a Mexican
Car too fast, give a fuck about pedestrian
And my section less niggas, more lesbians
Got your bitch, I'm that nigga
Yeah we poppin' like

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We poppin' like ayo
All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down
Screaming like ayo
I'mma take her ass down when she bring her friend around
Fuck ‘em both like ayo
I'm a bougie ass nigga, left the roof at home
We popping like ayo, ayo, ayo
But don't be acting like I need you

[Outro: Tyga]
Yeah, this that fly shit, King shit only
Drop top, no roof, ah
(I need you)
(I need you)
