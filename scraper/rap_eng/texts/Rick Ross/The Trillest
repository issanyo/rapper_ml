[Intro]
If they wanna go to war, well let's take 'em to war

[Chorus]
You niggas gon' feel this
La la, la la, la la
You niggas gon' feel this
La la, la la, la la
You fucking with the trillest
La la, la la, la la
You niggas gon' feel this
La la, la la, la la

[Verse 1]
Fuck niggas always get this shit bad
Best friend wanna stab you in the back
Ridin' round town, sellin' whip weight
Gotta keep going til I get straight
Last night they pulled another body out the lake
We got some zombies out here wanna eat a nigga face
Gotta stay real nigga, can't fake
Niggas got beef with a straight face
Can't have no stick, no extendo
Nigga want to go to war, holla 10-4
Baby mama fuckin niggas strappin' up the street
Blow you seein', all the traffic breakin' down a ki
If you got a pistol, better hold it up nigga
And you better keep it with you for these fuck niggas
Say you wanna kilo, gotta pay tax
Nigga kill P-Nut, here come the pay back

[Chorus]
You niggas gon' feel this
La la, la la, la la
You niggas gon' feel this
La la, la la, la la
You fucking with the trillest
La la, la la, la la
You niggas gon' feel this
La la, la la, la la

[Verse 2]
I'm lookin' in your eyes, and it's all fake
Niggas in the prison, killin' over corn flakes
Time to get a new Benz, but I'm gon' wait
'Til the feds give my dawg his new release date
Young mogul, but a nigga came from the mud
Say a prayer, pray my son will never be a thug
Came up with a plan nigga, I'm a mastermind
Richest nigga in the hood, I ain't hard to find
Swear to god, on 'em all, nigga self made
And I got a lotta bitches cause I'm well paid
Lord take it, I'm sure to show my war wounds
Gave a million to my dawgs like it's dog food
Real niggas known to do the real thing
Standing on 15th , 'bout 15
AR-15 come and get me
And I know my real niggas gon' miss me

[Chorus]
You niggas gon' feel this
La la, la la, la la
You niggas gon' feel this
La la, la la, la la
You fucking with the trillest
La la, la la, la la
You niggas gon' feel this
La la, la la, la la
