(feat. Rick Ross)

Life, and all the lessons I've learned...
I done been through it all, I done had people try take my life...
Leave me for dead, but victories that much greater when you climb out from the gutter, ya feel me

Yous a bitch yous a lame yous a coward
I thought your love was sweet until it turned sour
You snuck up from the back and stabbed me
I ain't even see it coming but I been here bleeding for weeks
Got my nervous system twisted over you
I'm all cold now so my blood runs blue
Thought we were timeless, but you were spineless
Gave me a death certificate but I won't sign it

No I will not go, even thou that blow knocked me on the flo'
But you ain't seen the last of me, turn your back on me
But you'll regret it, that's right you messed up homie
You should've killed me

(Rick Ross:)
When ya hatin on me cause I'm elevatin homie
Every day I find another way to put that paper on me
When the top down ride like the president
Flyest thing in the game and I'm talking present tense
Go ahead and squeeze that trigger get rid of that evidence
Look me in my eye, you can't because I'm heaven sent
I will never die, haters fail every time they try
What if I kill em first, your honor is that justified

You tried to take me out the game
But I'm a soldier, you shot me in the heart
And I came back on ya, ain't got the juice to put me down
I am the truth, all my kanye in this booth getting it in that's the proof

Tried to destroy me and turn me into a monster
But their ain't been enough to (? ) that I ain't conquer
And you no different, just another name on the list
Yea I'm wounded but I'm still that bitch

No I will not go, even thou that blow knocked me on the flo'
But you ain't seen the last of me, turn your back on me
But you'll regret it, that's right you messed up homie
You should've killed me

I will never die, haters fail every time they try
What if I kill em first, your honor is that justified

Thought that I was finished, thought that you had handled your business
Thought you knew how it ended, apparently you didn't
Think that I won't pull through and my last breath you thought I blew it
And now who lookin stupid, stupid
You underestimated thought I would lay down and take it
That's where you made your mistake, And the monster has been awaken
Ready for war, been there before, now it's time to even the score
You shoulda killed me
