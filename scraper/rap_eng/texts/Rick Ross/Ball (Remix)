[Intro: Rick Ross]
MasterMind, nigga
Money bag, shorty, I’mma take over all this shit
I put that money on you, nigga
Your own brother’ll do you, you hear me?
Yeah you, nigga
At your granddaddy’s house

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Ridin’ with a model, a prize, she can swallow
Tat my name on her any nigga got a problem
Crib big as Lenox, fuck goin’ shoppin’
Throw a couple dollars, you can’t compare papi
Bitch you know I got it, I could get you waxed
Dirty-ass nigga do your ass for a stack
White Reeboks – I ride in the Porsche
Gladys Knight, hazard lights, got a bag for your boy
RIP Gene, rest in peace Timmy D
ATL legends when it came to the green
Wanna start a war with them Miami boys
Fuck around and just make your granddaddy house explode
(At your granddaddy house, nigga)
(Nigga, I put a million on you)
(Had to do ya at your granddaddy house, nigga)

[Interlude]
Boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss
Boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss
Double M G, nigga, we run this shit - fuck

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Hundred hoes in the house and they all fuckin’
Watch dog-ass Gunplay ball again
I don’t see these motherfuckers, they small as hell
Two places I ain’t goin’ – broke and jail
You think you really run this hit until you run into me
We can turn this into whatever you want it to be
I got a bitch in the bed, I got fee in the safe
So much fee in the safe, she let me pee in her face
I need a cunt and a blunt, everyday of the month
It’s a full-time job not to trigger you up
I know all y’all hatin’, I’m the nigga you love
Fresh out the cuff spot and fill up the club
You say you got hoes, nigga, how many?
Show me one and I bet I’ve been all in it
Every day since then she been callin’ me
I was all in that pussy smokin’ Paul Lemon

[Hook]
Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball, ball
Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball
I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt
