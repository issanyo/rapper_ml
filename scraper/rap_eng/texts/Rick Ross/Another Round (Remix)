[Intro: Rick Ross]
She self made, I'm self made
We're made for each other

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
They calling me the hottest in the game
Never the gold, I wanted gold plated chains
Have sex on a highway in the Lexus
Suck her neck before I eat her like she's breakfast
Never mind the rumors baby this is me and you
Bail hard but balling 50 on them pretty shoes
With foreign names, valet the Range
Different positions, but she still moaning the same
Millie on my neck, thumbin through that check
Rozay in effect, know how to make her wet
Roses by the dozen, everyday I'm hustling
Blowing money fast looking like I'm saving nothing
Let's take another trip, different continents we touching
Niggas getting flipped, I get them done for nothing
Shout out to Joe and Chris, It's A.P on my wrist
I'm still seeing bricks like it's still '86
Over 20 homes, but I need a chick
And she got the bomb, I'm talking tick tick
She got the bomb, I'm talking tick tick
And if you feel I'm wrong, baby you should tell me this
You can't tell me shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don’t you be holding back, your love
Don’t you be holding back
Don’t you be holding back, your love
Don’t you be holding back
Cause in the end girl you’re gonna want another round, another round
Girl you’re gonna want another round, another round
I used to want you, and her and her and her and you and her and her
I used to want you, and her and her and her
All I want, all I want, all I want is you
Shawty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
The bitch badder than any bitch that you name
I’m talking Janet, maybe Kim K, I hear Rihanna she like it kinky

[Verse 2: Wale]
Listen, uno papi chulo bout to show you what you been missing
Sex is just a weapon, I can leave you wet from this pistol
I cannot believe you think you young and tripping
Why you tryin to read me if you see there isnt any issues
Double MG, Wale she call me Olu
At a polo with no logo, and my zapatos is like 4 0's
Let's have a toast for this new love
I scoop you up at like 2 somethin'
Truthfully don't do much, but with you trying do something
Poetic genius, my home is scenic
My latest feature probly got these haters grieving
At the same time had they lady geekin'
Clearly pissed them off without no star they 1080p-in'
And my kick game beyond crazy
Clark Kent, Fat Joe, the only ones who may fade me
Ain't no better swimming in the ocean of your lady
We way beyond haters we just finished self-made 3
Ralph!

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don’t you be holding back, your love
Don’t you be holding back
Don’t you be holding back, your love
Don’t you be holding back
Cause in the end girl you’re gonna want another round, another round
Girl you’re gonna want another round, another round
I used to want you, and her and her and her and you and her and her
I used to want you, and her and her and her
All I want, all I want, all I want is you
Shawty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
The bitch badder than any bitch that you name
I’m talking Janet, maybe Kim K, I hear Rihanna she like it kinky

[Verse 3: Stalley]
And I'mma be honest she's the fliest here
Her shoe game is everything heels then I get 10
All the ladies bad, their dresses Kashmir
She glammed up behind that eyeliner I know there's tears
She seem a little brave, but I sense the fear
Her defense is up I'm wishing that it disappears
I'm wishing that she listens up cause this is...
... materialize her love for one who doesn't care
She say all men treat her wrong way
Yeah, I know, that's what they all say
But I get you, I bang with you the long way
And we got history, let's repeat it the right way
Another round what the song say

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don’t you be holding back, your love
Don’t you be holding back
Don’t you be holding back, your love
Don’t you be holding back
Cause in the end girl you’re gonna want another round, another round
Girl you’re gonna want another round, another round
I used to want you, and her and her and her and you and her and her
I used to want you, and her and her and her
All I want, all I want, all I want is you
Shawty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
The bitch badder than any bitch that you name
I’m talking Janet, maybe Kim K, I hear Rihanna she like it kinky
