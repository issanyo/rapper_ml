Dog check this out man I needa holla at you dog
I don't mean to rain on your parade my nigga but
Sit down dog

No pot to piss in, no window to throw it out
But I'm on my mission, it's a lot of drama now
My draws are stained, mucus membranes done drained
Ain't lookin' the same, steady tryin' to maintain
So what's the focus, my thrid eye of the Devil open
I'm really hoping he won't take me back to robbin' and yolkin
I look at myself in the mirror, my pistol tuck
Not giving a fuck, only thing blessed with was bad luck
I'm back on the corner, with a new lease on life
I got a new pistol won't sleep for 'least four nights
I don't fuck with these pussies
I'm squeezin' if they touch me or push me
I'm up in some pussy up out there
Muscling with Uzi's
No nigga could see me, all the years being mistreated
Or underfed, all the snacks under my mama bed
It's hot as hell, no AC in the summertime
It make you wanna die, somehow I just wanna ride
So I start my quest

Career criminal
In the streets with the feinds
Indictment and things of me fleeing the scene
Career criminal
I started with dope fiends
Now I'm a O.G., these streets they know me
Career criminal
Gun sticks and knives
Any altercations, yeah, yo ass gon die
Career criminal
Hitman for hire
Just a few stacks, boom boom, retire

I spend five for the nickle rock, turn that bitch into a dime
Now a nigga get the drift, clientele grow with time
Now a nigga shoppin now, look at what I'm coppin now
Might sound funny, scoop her up just to knock her down
Fuck catchin' the bus, bought a brand new Monte Carlo
Got half in my pocket, bring the other half tomorrow
Look at me shining bitch, rewards of grindin bitch
Fruits of my labor, they walkin' while I'm drivin' bitch
One nickle bag of 'erb and I'm on top of the world
My balls and my word, that's all I got in this world
I smoked a blunt with my homie before they found him slain
I cried with his momma but told her that's part of the game
I'm into trafficking, excuse me, travelling
I pop the trunk, yo ass couldn't imagine it
Career criminal, that's all I am
Now I'm sellin' this, look at me, damn

Career criminal
In the streets with the feinds
Indictment and things of me fleeing the scene
Career criminal
I started with dope fiends
Now I'm a O.G., these streets they know me
Career criminal
Gun sticks and knives
Any altercations, yeah, yo ass gon die
Career criminal
Hitman for hire
Just a few stacks, boom boom, retire

Now I'm on top of ki's, we world apart
Travel across the seas, where girls menage
Now I'm a young man, dick in my hand
Dick Cheney'll help me get them bricks in his land
I'm out in Vegas with bitches and all the biggest players
I'm holdin' paper, callin' shots, fuck asking favors
I see that, been at the top of the Trump
This bitch in pumps, she squat swallow then she cums
I sold that, kickin doors where ya hold at
You doing something I couldn't, let's suppose that
I'm well-known, where the hoes at
Well-known wherever you blow your nose at
Career criminal, reminiscing the visuals
Individuals dealing the dope for the residuals
Residing in luxury, guard gated communities
God gave and granted me this immunity
