[Intro]
Run with me or run from me
Pussies don't get pussy, yeah

[Verse 1]
I murdered all of my foes, contract killin'
Twenty K will get ya grand mammy pinned to the ceilin'
Midst of the war, I piss on graves
Kids get grazed by my piss poor ways
Never could imagine it, livin' with paralysis
Shoulda checked ya rear view, made a better analysis
Wack yayo caught him slippin' while he snort dust
Cold blood, bullet hit him like a tour bus
Check the time on my Movado
My jazzy bitch a mulatto who thinks it's petty to model
Suede Louis on my feet, still runnin' the street
And I never missed a heartbeat

[Hook]
Family over the money, money over the bitches
Money don't mean nothin', then why they callin' it riches?
I'm addicted to watches, Mama tellin' me stop it
Got one over 50, 50 you better watch it

[Verse 2]
Do him in cold blood
Look him in his eyes, may do him with no gloves
Beat the case like Orenthal
Above the law, it's so hard to pin the big dog
Live on so I still bark
In my earliest convenience I'mma kill y'all
Make a lil cake, haters wanna envy
God wanna see you niggas in a Bentley

[Hook]
Family over the money, money over the bitches
Money don't mean nothin', then why they callin' it riches?
I'm addicted to watches, Mama tellin' me stop it
Got one over 50 and keep 50 in my pocket

[Verse 3]
Limousines for the don, number three is the charm
Flee red carpet, chillin' E on my arm
Purple rain, smokin' head smokin' weed, call it "purple brain"
I'm in the purple label, daddy got a purple heart
Not in the service but I'm swervin' in a purple car
Once the bitch need a oil change
I go and buy a new one cause I'm spoiled mayne

[Hook]
Family over the money, money over the bitches
Money don't mean nothin', then why they callin' it riches?
I'm addicted to watches, Mama tellin' me stop it
You know I'm totin' the rocket so don't make a nigga pop it

[Outro: Bang 'Em Smurf]
Ayo, what's poppin', man?
This the boy Bang 'Em Smurf, man
New York, what up?
Queens, what up?
M.I.A., look, man
We put the round on all these niggas, man
They know what it is, man
The whole Southside stand up
