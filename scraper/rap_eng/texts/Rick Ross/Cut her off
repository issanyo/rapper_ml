Them boys wearing fake belts
They drink fake lean
Niggas smoking synthetic, huh

Bitches dropping like, swish, Ricky Pitino
50 racks on the corner, think it's casino
Hoes thinking I'm boojie, when I'm smoking on gucci
All my shoes be Gucci, I got a mill for Lil Boosie
Double M on the rise, duct tape on my pistol
So you won't be surprised, it's time to make this official
Got a bitch on the East, got a bitch on the West
When I'm eating the box, I let her sit on my chest
You know I love her a lot, she let me fuck on my yacht
Rolling dice with my niggas, a half a ticket, the pot
I blew a brick out in Reno, Uncle Paulie casino
Niggas shot up my car, walk away like Benzino
Percocets for myself, I feel a hundred degrees
Niggas getting that money, bust it down with your team
From the Chevy to Bentley, from the Bentley to Rolls
It may seem like we do, we never loving them hoes
It gotta add up tonight, we call it simple mathematics
Transfers and wires, that happen under the mattress
Niggas shoot for the stars, pray a larger amount
Niggas thought I was slipping, I got a grip on the South

It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
So what you saying ho?
You Know I'm the man ho?

Nothing but a bird I'mma leave you where you stand, ho
Heard you got a man ho
Hope he understand though
You ain't nothing but a creeper baby, I'm just saying
Though
Saying, though
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off

Creeping on the low, hope your man don't see
She will bust it down for some damn Lime-A-Ritas
Chew me like some bubblegum, something like Rasheeda
Gotta get my partner some, she on me like Adidas
Baby, you can't hold back, better stop flexing like you not
Your man tryna patrol then I guess he is a cop
But he really can't cuff if he busting at my spot
But I done had enough cause you making my shit hot
Blowing up a nigga phone, what I tell yo ass 'bout that?
Tryna hold something, hold my nuts, can you do that?
Can you play around with that mouth while he hit it from the
Back?
You can't say nothing now cause we all been through that
Through that

It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off

So what you saying ho?
You Know I'm the man ho?

You know that ain't a real bag bitch, that's a knock off
When I get that work I get to juggin' like hot sauce
All swimmin pool lakefront
Hit it from the back, rearrange her lace front
Stuntin', tattoos on my neck and on my kidney
If I don't like that ho I turn her ass into a frisbee
If I dont like your disc I turn that ho into a frisbee
I throw it out on Old Nat right by the Wendy's
Three cellphones and all of 'em jumpin'
I can see your hoes and all em' nothing
Yeah I'm a don don', Don Cheadle, Don Cornelius
Watch the Dom spill
Pockets fat as Don Carter Jeter, nigga, done deal!

It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off

Baby I'm ashamed, why you acting this way?
Heard she 'bout that action, you can bring her this way
Hit her on yo mattress, make you feel some type of way
Pass her to my migos, they gonna bust it, Â¡Andale!
Please don't play no games cause I know thats what you like
Knock it out the frame, baby girl, it's alright
Yeah that pussy bomb, I just call it dynamite
You ready? Here I come, I can do this shit all night
