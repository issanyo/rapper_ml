[Intro]
It's no facade or no chapard
Well acquainted with Audemars and all that shit
It's Ricky Ross the rich boss

[Verse 1]
Wet bars on the boat, what broad won't elope
Crib like Scott Storch all from the coke
Maybachs were a dream now it's all real
It's hard to get sleep layin' next to five mil
Still got the chills, I call 'em the goosebumps
Yeah Alexander vision, I'm buildin' like two Trumps
Steppin' guce bumps I'm the main event
We got a pocket full of game, brain it made me ten
Six bitches' numbers all on the same napkin
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
You see it these niggas livin' of the past
I ran a hundred miles but I did it all with class
Hands all glass, wrist all glass
Mirror on the wall, how long will the crystal last
Champagne pours, celebrate the cause
Hover above the laws at the mercy of the Lord

[Hook]
This me nigga, It's me nigga
While we do our thing, give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture, this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin' money, you can miss me nigga
This me nigga, It's me nigga
While we do our thing, give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture, this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin' money, you can miss me nigga

[Verse 2]
What's worse, a testimony from you homie?
Tables turn fast, I told you not to fuck me, Tony
Started with the dishes, endin' with the digits
I had to cross friendship, it's rules to the business
All the time with a sister like Gina
Beauty salon dream, got the keys and the Beamer
On the way to cheetahs pointin' an army
Land my spaceship with the spoilers only
Seen the UFOs, FBI, ATF, let ‘em know how a nigga ride
Fo-fo and fo-five and six fo's
Half a pill, two dime, six hoes
I need a slice of the pie, fo five six
As I throw my dice in the sky
Head crack nigga
Bread stack nigga
Convertible Bert yeah I let my hair back nigga

[Hook]
This me nigga, It's me nigga
While we do our thing, give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture, this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin' money, you can miss me nigga
This me nigga, It's me nigga
While we do our thing, give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture, this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin' money, you can miss me nigga

[Verse 3]
Lamborghinis and Maseratis for mediocres
When the beat's over, back to the street, soldier
Call cold shoulders might make me bring the heats over
When the beef's over, might see the peach rover
We eats but we try to reach each quota
No soda, Rolls roller one on her
Rodeo eighty gram, one coda
Louis Vuitton, bright sides don’t want ‘em
They trippin', I’m drippin' in Tiffany stones
Get a mop, Peter prop, I’m livin' it homes
Chauffeur I blow purp and no skirts
Four chains I’m puttin' down with more work

[Hook]
This me nigga, It's me nigga
While we do our thing, give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture, this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin' money, you can miss me nigga
This me nigga, It's me nigga
While we do our thing, give me six feet nigga
Better take a picture, this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin' money, you can miss me nigga
