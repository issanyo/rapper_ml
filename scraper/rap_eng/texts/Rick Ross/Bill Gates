[Intro]
Call me Bill Gates
I told that bitch to save my number in her phone under Bill Gates ya heard me
Uh, ya heard me
I just need you to do for me what I need you to do for me and imma come through when you need me bitch
Ya heard me bitch
Bitch, ya heard me bitch!

[Verse 1]
Silk sweaters, dirty Berettas and petty vendettas
Niggas is jealous, I get it, bring it when and wherever
Court dates and caskets, I'm tryna stay composed
Out on bond, on the run, won't ever sell my soul
Doing bad, I shorted my connect a cool mil'
At the lab tryna keep my name out the news reels
Or at the Palms and I know the Feds across the hall
I got a bitch who licking balls, my back against the wall
All black photographs that speak a million words
One selfie with me and they think you're dealing birds

[Hook]
Louis towels and the Gucci slides
Bill Gates still real when it's out of style
I want it all, Wingstops on every corner
I want a mall and I'm about to build a Benihana
Bond out my dogs, quarter million on a new appeal
They call me Bill Gates and they know the money real
They wanna know my name I tell them Bill Gates
Just blew a hundred million and I'm still straight !! (woooooo)
They started waving flags when the ruckus came
Just put a hundred kilos on the stock exchange

[Verse 2]
Crack money, Nike sweats, wake up in night sweats
Homemade key lime pie we cutting slices
All my people eat at the table when we say our grace
One eye open for the Judas who wanna take my place
Twelve disciples, I got two shooters, nigga ten bodies
Caught a few niggas living thinkin' that I ain't bout it
Dickie shirts, blood stains, come with the drug game
Cell phones tapped, fast money and cum stains
Public defenders say a number and you niggas tremble
Judge dropped the mallet, may as well put a bullet in you

[Hook]
Louis towels and the Gucci slides
Bill Gates still real when it's out of style
I want it all, Wingstops on every corner
I want a mall and I'm about to build a Benihana
Bond out my dogs, quarter million on a new appeal
They call me Bill Gates and they know the money real
They wanna know my name I tell them Bill Gates
Just blew a hundred million and I'm still straight !! (woooooo)
They started waving flags when the ruckus came
Just put a hundred kilos on the stock exchange

[Verse 3]
Cold cases they wanna put me in the hot seat
FingerLicking laugh over lobster in the front seat
Niggas follow me in hopes of finding my stash box
In the ghost like the pope, the all glass top
Look around I smile at you as I'm looking down
Bill Gates, that red Chevy it be thumping loud
I put my niggas on they feet we can't be fucking up
So fuck a hundred bricks, flip a hundred restaurants

[Hook]
I want it all, Wingstops on every corner
I want a mall and i'm about to build a benihana
Bond out my dogs, quarter million on a new appeal
They call me Bill Gates and they know the money real
They wanna know my name I tell them Bill Gates
Just blew a hundred million and I'm still straight
They started waving flags when the ruckus came
Just put a hundred kilos on the stock exchange
