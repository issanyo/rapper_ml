[Verse 1: Tink (Jay Z)]
I'm the plug nigga
I plug niggas from out of state
I know drug dealers who drug niggas in broad day
(Sellin' bud nigga, bud nigga, bud nigga
Sorry to inform you all I'm a drug dealer
I'm a...)
Hustler, get my percentages off the top
Suited like Mr. Carter, my niggas is holding rocks
That's a...
(Dope nigga)
I poke niggas like Pillsbury
Robin' them in they hood
Mask on me like Jim Carrey
Got a Spanish boy who don't speak no Ingles
Give him the product, he gone pack it like it's Greenbay
(Nigga I'm a trapstar, trapstar, tr-trapstar hero
Disguised as a rapstar, uh, the flows ghetto
Earth is not my home)
They find me like Bin Laden
ABC tellin' stories, the government steady plottin'
Niggas say they hustle, they in Bugattis
If money ain't comin' quick, we stretch it like some pilates
Go

[Hook: Tink]
Always on that come-up, uh, still movin' bass
(still movin' bass, still movin' bass)
Ever seen hustles you don't know about, still movin' bass
(still movin' bass, still movin' bass)
I'm a hustler, take my percentages off the top (I'm a hustler)
(I'm a hustler, take my percentages off the top)
Ima hustler, get my percentages off the top (I'm a hustler)
(I'm a hustler, get my percentages off the top)

[Verse 2: Tink (Rick Ross)]
I enjoy the workin'
Drug lords and watch boys
Eat or be eaten every season they make a choice
Like Lebron James, niggas switchin for diamond rings
Get that
(Long money, short winded, let's go and get it
It's amazing)
Bang bang
Get to business
([?] ceilings)
Junkie at the door like Jehovah's Witness
(20 chickens watchin' and I still be movin' that bass
Gave a job to the children you scared to raise)
But my chain swingin'
Now, my name ringin'
My niggas hate new faces so we all racist
(We movin' weight up at a different pace)
2 steps ahead so I lead 'em like I'm T.D. Jakes
(I'm hard to kill Dade County, Versace Hills)
I am the motto
From Dade County up to Chicago
(Only one man got the combination to the safe)
Only woman in the field movin' 'round the bass

[Hook]
Always on that come-up, uh, still movin' bass
(still movin' bass, still movin' bass)
Ever seen hustles you don't know about, still movin' bass
(still movin' bass, still movin' bass)
I'm a hustler, take my percentages off the top (I'm a hustler)
(I'm a hustler, take my percentages off the top)
Ima hustler, get my percentages off the top (I'm a hustler)
(I'm a hustler, get my percentages off the top)
