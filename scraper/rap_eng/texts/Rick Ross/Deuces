[Rick Ross:]
Got a pocket full of hundreds
She the only one is missing
Got a bucket full of ice
And a watch to go with it
Got a racing Lamborghini
Have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes
Now iâ€™m talking ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y on that wall in the hall of fame
I let my denim sag
Red Louis belt
How can u love me baby, first you gotta love yourself !
