[Verse One: Rockie Fresh]
Bitch, I'm out here grinding, crib like king of diamonds
You can catch me wearing (two chains), yeah, I’m shining
With my nigga freshgoods, making sure them checks good
Gotta feed the homies, real players with respect would
These flashing lights is blinding, go get them a visor
Call the beat a gas leak and I set this shit on fire
And I don't fuck with liars, only tell the truth
Honesty is key and that is in and out the booth
Ball while they in the bleachers, so high they can't reach us
I dropped out of college and made more dough than my teachers
Definition of swagging, all off of my passion
One time for real niggas that's out there making it happen

[Hook]
A middle finger to them niggas who say that we ain't fly
We above all the drama cause we out here staying high
You gon' see a real nigga when you look me in the eye
I'm a leader in this bitch and homie, I can tell you why
I'm on fire, you say you more fire, then nigga, you a lie
I'm on fire, you say you more fire, then nigga, you a lie
I'm on fire, you say you more fire, then nigga, you a lie
I'm on fire, you say you more fire, then nigga, you a lie

[Verse Two: Rockie Fresh]
Now while in deep thought, when I was high
Thought about a time that I wasn't even picked to be the leader of the Chi
Just a young nigga, trying to get up out the jam
Man, them niggas ain't know, now them niggas like damn
People I ain't know trying to say they my fam
See the jewels and they try to play Cam
Tell ‘em they can dip if they ain’t running with the set
And if you got money, you can go and place a bet
I'll be in the sky ‘cause we riding on a jet
Rolling up the wet and never getting seen
Because I got a name and a brand to protect
And all I ask from the people is respect
In return they're gon' get the same thing
They took a young player from the Chi off the bench
Now they're about to watch the whole game change
Remember my name and understand that I’m a go-getter
Money maker, made a promise I can’t be no broke nigga
That would be a let-down like unraveling a broke swisher
Me and success is a dope picture, you on the scene then I fuck with ya

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Rick Ross]
Versace forever, draped like I’mma king
My Jesus piece yellow, flooded like Melpomene
Invest in my niggas, watch the joy that it brings
All these beautiful bitches, such a beautiful thing
I own all them autos, I bone the mulattoes
Busting shots at would be robbers right in front of McDonalds
Never been scathed, belligerent ways, they all stumble and fall
Back to my wonderful day, what you wanna do?
What you wanna do? What you wanna do?
Grab a couple bitches like I play the fool yeah
Balling what we do, balling what we do, balling what we do
Wide body Benz hanging with my crew, yeah

[Outro]
I'm on fire, you say you more fire, then nigga, you a lie
I'm on fire, you say you more fire, then nigga, you a lie
I'm on fire, you say you more fire, then nigga, you a lie
I'm on fire, you say you more fire, then nigga, you a lie
