[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Do anything that you can to make me feel so protected
I don't wanna worry no more
I'd give anything for you to come and help me perfect it
I don't wanna worry no more
I don't wanna worry no more
I don't wanna worry
Wanna feel like I'm brand new
Even though I gotta have you
All them other bitches stab you
They was close enough to grab you
Ain't no other way, they had to
I'ma always hold it down for ya
Look at how I move around for ya

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Rick Ross]
Do anything that you can to make me feel so protected
I don't wanna worry no more (Oh)
Just want you to know my name by the time we exit
Wanna feel like I'm brand new
Even though I gotta have you
All them other bitches stab you
They was close enough to grab you (Uh)
I don't wanna worry no more

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
The feeling that you give me is a coke rush (Uh)
Addicted to fast money, white Lamborghini (Woo!)
My name ring bells, authorities wanna see me (Boss)
Born king, I swore she was Nefertiti
Never been to Egypt, try to stay up out of debt (Ah!)
IRS is watching, they follow us on my neck (Yeah)
Still onto me but I'm only coming correct
This audio is gems, my niggas wanna collect
We the biggest in the game so let's just give us respect
Dance like a star, ass shake like a car
She really something special, I can tell from afar
Eyes on the check, 8-figures, feelin' best (Woo!)
Hustle on the corner, Givenchy be the finesse (Woo!)
Ex-drug dealer but still got his connects (Ah), yes (Haha)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Do anything that you can to make me feel so protected (Oh, oh)
I don't wanna worry no more (Oh)
Just want you to know my name by the time we exit
I don't wanna worry no more
I don't wanna worry no more (Oh)
I don't wanna worry (Oh)
I'ma always hold it down for ya
Look at how I move around for ya (Oh)
I'ma always hold it down for ya
Move around for ya
I don't wanna worry no more
I don't wanna worry
I don't wanna worry no more (Ooh)
Hold it down for ya
I'ma move around for ya
I don't wanna worry no more
Hold it down for ya
Every time I come around for ya
I'ma always hold it down for ya
Look at how I move around for ya
Do anything that you can, to make me feel so protected
I don't wanna worry
I don't wanna worry no more

[Outro: Jennifer Lopez]
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I move around for ya

How I move around for ya
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I move around for ya
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I move around for ya
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I move around for ya
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I move around for ya
(Oh-oh-oh)
