(Rick Ross)
I'm a real thug so my rims scrub
No black and milds the blunt filled up
I got a V-12 sweeter than the female
It feels like intercourse bucklin' the seatbelt
Picture all black down to the shoes man
Brought it from a Don gave his ass two thangs
Know him as the boss I swerve two lanes
Picturing Ricky Ross me and Dre do thangs

(Dre)
Listen up nigga I got an idea
I aim this K at you and you come off the pies nigga
I ain't playing fool this ain't X-box
But I can take you to the morgue and you pick out the best box
The rover ridin'(Dre), the chevy speakin'(Dre)
Yo' hoe she vibin'(Dre), She gonna let Dre hit it
I'm from North Miami ain't no secret homey
Quit acting hoe and walking like that chick Naomi
