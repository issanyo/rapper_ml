[Hook: Game & Jeezy]
I got a bad bitch from Vogue, told her strike a pose
Step to the side and look at them thighs, that bitch beautiful
I got a Lambo, two doors, two seaters, two hoes
Yokohamas, no Vogues, man, that bitch beautiful
Champagne fountains, crib in the mountains
Two-mile-long driveway, man, that ho beautiful
I got a condo up in the sky, 'fore I fake it, I'd die
Foreign bitch, no lie, man, that bitch beautiful

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Came up in the projects, dreamin' 'bout them mansions
Wit' the coke white walls, flow like bowlin' balls
Murci in my garage, course it is supercharged
Wake up to a ménage, they give me a massage
Closet filled wit' designer, Donatella recliner
Suede headliner, all that whippin China
I ain't talkin' Sprite when I say I need soda
Bought my first Caprice, put fifty in the motor
Bricks they was beautiful, yeah, Mona Lisa
The streets introduced me to money, nice to meet ya
Ray Charles in these Ray Bans, why?
Touched them keys with both hands?
If I die, remember me like Don Killuminati
Bury me on the left, right next to John Gotti
Play nothin' but that Cocaine Muzik, that Yo Gotti
Tombstone ready, took shit from nobody

[Verse 2: Game]
Mirror, mirror in my garage
Tell me which Lambo I should park at the L'Ermitage
Pull up at the The Mirage, it's Phantom's and Mazi's
Out here, expensive taste, my car is camouflage
Speakin' of camouflage, R.I.P to Camoflauge
Just drove through Savannah, Georgia, that shit beautiful
And his .4-5, is unusual
Push your shit back like nail shops do cuticles
Snowman, tell these niggas that we livin' it
Front yard like a soccer field, and we kickin' it
Sick condos, pockets full of Rondos
Choppers wit' extended clips long as El Segundo
Jeezy like Versace so we rented out the mansion
Fuckin' European models, skin white as Marilyn Manson
Came a long way from a nigga first advancement
Test drive the new Bugatti, hold that bitch for ransom

[Hook: Rick Ross & Jeezy]
I keep me a jet model, keep a black bottle
Meal ticket wrapped in plastic, that bitch beautiful
Keep some rose gold on my arm, bottle of Avion
FNH with the drum, man, that bitch beautiful
Baby girl, she out of Broward, smoove with the powder
Tats on her neck, straight checks, this bitch beautiful
I got a condo up in the sky, 'fore I fake it, I'd die
Foreign bitch, no lie, man, that bitch beautiful

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
My Chevrolet a seven trey, Dade County dope boy
I’m talkin' heavyweight, I hustle everyday
We squashed the beef to get the money
We set examples for rich niggas in Maserati's
My killers in the lobby, bitches keep my name ringin' (Boss!)
Execute a nigga; Abe Lincoln, 200 squares for the same ticket
Out in L.A., I’m with my main bitches
Tiptoein' on marble, got me trippin' on these painkillers
I’m still the same, I never changed, nigga
Went from razorbladin' rocks, no more holes in my socks
Fuck her like a champ, got me livin' like I box
Sugar Ray Leonard, nigga, I just want the drop
First nigga with the Wraith, underneath the stars
Better look me in my face, tell the tears' for my dogs
Fuckin' the same hoes but we got them different cars
(Ugh!) Beautiful are my odds
