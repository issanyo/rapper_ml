[Intro]
We'll never been no gain dog, we always been self made men you feel me? (I better believe)
So you know what I'm sayin', Ross could stand on his own you feel me?
So just keep goin' dog hit that billionaire status
And you know when I get there dog, you know what I'm sayin', we're gonna sit back and eat fish dinners
No crab meat, you know what I mean?

[Hook: Big KRIT]
I say lord, lord lord lord lord
I pray I don't be here
When it all goes down, when it all goes down
I say lord, lord lord lord lord
I pray I don't be here
When it all goes down, when it all goes down
There'll be hard times, and then song
Fire, and brimstones
Devil world from which you came
I pray that God will know my name
There'll be hard times, and then songs
Fire, and brimstones
Devil world from which you came
I pray that God will know my name
I say lord, lord lord lord lord

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Lord lord lord lord
I remember hard times always found a way to smile
It was quiet, Christmas time, no pretty lights around the house
They told me I was loud, didn't fit into they crowd
Mama need a spouse, Daddy always in and out
Age 15 so the caged bird sings
One year later seen a straight bird clean
All glitters ain't gold
These evil niggas prayin' for your soul
Walkin' through the fire, Hell on God's green Earth
Take a seat, close your eyes, bow your head, say church

[Hook 2: Big KRIT]
Lord, lord lord lord lord
I pray I don't be here
When it all goes down, when it all goes down
There'll be hard times, and then songs
Fire, and brimstones
Devil world from which you came
I pray that God will know my name
I say lord, lord lord lord lord

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Lord lord lord lord
I'm sittin' in the trap and I done did it with the best
Pull a double shift its time to get your boy some rest
Money on my mind, alcohol on my breath
On the road to riches as I stumble every step
Gold on my arm, gold on my neck
But whats in my heart I will cherish till the death
Same rainy days, but things never change
Prayin' to my maker just to take away this pain
Walkin' through the fire, Hell on God's green Earth
Take a seat, close your eyes, bow your head, say chuch

[Hook: Big KRIT]
I say lord, lord lord lord lord
I pray I don't be here
When it all goes down, when it all goes down
I say lord, lord lord lord lord
I pray I don't be here
When it all goes down, when it all goes down
There'll be hard times, and then song
Fire, and brimstones
Devil world from which you came
I pray that God will know my name
There'll be hard times, and then songs
Fire, and brimstones
Devil world from which you came
I pray that God will know my name
I say lord, lord lord lord lord
I pray I don't be here
When it all goes down, when it all goes down
I say lord, lord lord lord lord
I pray I don't be here
When it all goes down, when it all goes down
There'll be hard times, and then song
Fire, and brimstones
Devil world from which you came
I pray that God will know my name
There'll be hard times, and then songs
Fire, and brimstones
Devil world from which you came
I pray that God will know my name

[Outro: Kenneth "Boobie" Williams]
And I'd love to see that movie man, I know your only gonna get bigger
You know so, when y'all see me in the pictures on the yacht though
When I'm lookin' at the pictures on the yacht and I'm seein' my homies on yachts
That they own you know what I mean? Its like   okay, this what the movies been about from day one
You know a lot of times people misinterpret it, as far as the Carol City Cartel
The Matchbox and think it was just violence
It wasn't never about violence, it was all about survival and gettin' that position
So now, you know this the platform we had to use - this call is from a federal prison -
Now dudes get in position and we love that position because we love to win
And we gonna continue to win, as long as we breathin'
You know what I'm sayin'? And our kids gon' win, and they kids gon' win because this what its bout'
You know what I mean?
So you already know fam, the big homie, its just, you know what I'm sayin', a product of his environment
Who used his environment to get in position and if a person don't like that
Then they don't like success dog
Because, you know, we ain't gon' never stop
You know, and thats what I like about Rick Ross and all his music - beep beep - picture with words
Tell everybody I send my love man, and Carol City, Matchbox, for live dog. Carol City Cartel too, you hear me?

Good Man! (good man, good man, good man, good man, good man)
