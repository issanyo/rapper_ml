[Pre-Hook]

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Money on my mind, pistol on my lap
Tinted windows, nigga I can tell you about that
If you are a penny boy don't fall into the trap
Hate all in your heart, I feel it when you give me dap
Testify, come on nigga now you're petrified
Can't sleep under your window cause they spraying pesticides
My hustle is supreme nigga, like Supreme nigga
Biggie on the wall, Nicki on the team nigga
Best seller Robert Green on you streams nigga
Puppet master, don't make me pull the strings nigga
Iced in and blood boil like a fiend hit it
If Afeni he had a genie, Machavelli would be near me
Bitches on my tip ' cause I fuck 'em till they drip
She make me bust a nut then I might just load the clip
You know we bout that money when you see us on the strip
The pussy be so good but it make me want to flip

[Verse 2]
Money calls in the morning, death threats through the night
Sleep in the vest and hired a look alike
Fucking on the pill, chicken bags and how we feel
Ever put your lips on a man worth a hundred mill?
Told 'em ain't no stopping me, they even went and copied me
Dressed how I dress count the palms on my property
She a dick rider but you gotta do it properly
Cause I get offers from these pretty bitches constantly
Click dick g wagon change a bitch life
Her daddy to the crib broke him with a game of dice
Fuck for a buck, thats exactly what I give
Marble on the ceiling cause this crib I wanna flip
Get it how you live, dollar sign on my bib
Baby gangster, BG, gotta shout out Barry Gibb
If that pussy pretty I could kiss it for an hour
Fucking with my jewelry on, she got me in the shower

[Hook]
(Rick Ross) That pussy bout to drive a nigga crazy boy
Drive a nigga crazy
This pussy bout to drive a nigga crazy boy

Riding through the city

Drive a nigga crazy
(Rick Ross) This pussy bout to drive a nigga crazy boy
Drive a nigga crazy
