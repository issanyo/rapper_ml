Laid back and I'm in it ah, blaze that and get lifted ah
Bad bourgeoisie bitches in the back Maybach rose tippin' ah

Vvs diamonds it's murder shining screaming 'redrum' in a jewelry store
Made it out the belly of the beast without even a lil' bit of dirt on my
Louie V fleece
You move on two but I'll move on three moulin rouge in a moulin suite
Roof top view, brick in my jeans, girls love beyonce that why she screams
'Say my name, say my name, say my name', while I hit it hit it from the
Back ah

Sippin' French vino in Reno, me and my clique oh you know we just keeping
It simple

Thick beauty bitch I buy that bitch thick by the belly I had to get
My wrist cost me 20 bricks, my left wrist on some stupid shit
