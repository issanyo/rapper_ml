[Intro]
Trilla, Ross, yeah
Trilla, feels good baby
Boss, I done took over the game nigga
Hoppin' out the Bugatti with my Ballys on
No underwear nigga
My jeans tight fitted too nigga
Jay-Z what up nigga
Uh yeah, let me fuck with 'em right now

[Verse 1]
Niggas want to kidnap
Leave me in the trunk, walk away with big stacks
They jealous of the fortune
Glitz and the fame, a cocaine mortgage
In the game like Tony Parker
Snow white Range, let my partner park it
I'm back on them thangs that's my only problem
Homie I put that on my only momma
Still rollin' with the fo'-fifth
Now that I'm rich, got these broke niggas so sick
And my daughter college pre-paid
She straight, say thanks to the D game
In the Phantom on that 2Pac
Ridin' Thru The Ghetto like I'm lookin' for a new spot
I'm not, but I'm well established
I fuck with heroin because it sells the fastest

[Hook]
I'mma rider 'bout mine, and I wouldn't tell a lie
Take it out of town, go and get my money right
And if it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
If it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

[Verse 2]
A bitch try and stick me
Cause you fuck me, don't mean you can kiss me
I only fuck with the O.G.'s
The ones that won't turn you in to the police
On the run I threw a nigga fo' keys
ID's, passports it was so sweet, they lookin at me
Front yard still a car show
Bugatti, the Gotti of Morocco
I won't let the roof up
Kingdom come, Prince of Zamundah
To be loved, to be loved
Oh what a feeling for me to be loved
Haters want to murder me and I can smell a hit
So it's music to my ears every time I fill a clip
I'm a card shark up in the Hard Rock
Twenty grand a hand, favorite jam in the iPod

[Hook]
I'mma rider 'bout mine, and I wouldn't tell a lie
Take it out of town, go and get my money right
And if it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
If it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

[Verse 3]
Hid a hundred grand in a day bed
Whip that white girl just like K-Fed
Got me a white girl, I fuck 'til her face red
Yeah her food tastes bad, but she give me great head
Please let me say that I really love her credit
Send her to dealership and she-can ,she-can get that
My heart in the ghetto, I'm married to the projects
I ride with the AR, in case a nigga start shit

[Hook]
I'mma rider 'bout mine, and I wouldn't tell a lie
Take it out of town, go and get my money right
And if it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
If it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

[Outro]
Triple C, we unstoppable
Told y'all niggas in '95 I was worth ten million
Now it's '08 and I got ten in the bank nigga
What else y'all got for me nigga? I wanna see it
I need yours too homie
Y'all niggas gettin' washed up, ya know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Y'all need to let a nigga slide through like that there real proper like
Tryna make some moves man
See I got on my Tom Ford shades nigga I got a new outlook on life y'know
Ever since I got my W-2 back, you feel me
I got plans for you niggas man
Murder is not a problem
I'm the boss, still comin' 183rd nigga
Hit me up on the 3-0-5 or the 7-8-6
It's all the same gang, posted up in front of Popeye's in the Maybach, nigga
You done seen me nigga
Triple C's nigga, I'm the boss
Church
