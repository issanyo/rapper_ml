[Intro: Rick Ross]
I, uh, I hung the chandeliers in the trap boy
Uh, Double M, Trae what up

[Bridge: Trae tha Truth]
Me against the world, got it from the bottom
Now I'm on my own shit, they wasn't on shit

[Verse 1: Trae tha Truth]
I'm giving 'em tec, 'til it knock the king of it back
Stable or something I'm not you better not think too attached
No feelings to catch, dreams get cut, better relax
No vacation, like get you packed ain't never teaching, it's fact
I was in a state of mind of somebody who prolly finna trip
I wanted a piece of a peace of mind' but it got up and dipped
Minus the whip I hope the bitch crazy she end where she deserve
Let you go to workin' my nerves, so you power minus the surgeon
In this demonstration of prayers, no words I'm spazzin'
Hear the kick in for the river and that's nothing you has been
For everything they ever done my heart colder than Aspen
While they wake up, I barely sleep overdosin' on aspirine
Sick of people stoppin' and knockin', but still they jock when it's poppin'
The type to work with his arm, they go to poppin' and rockin'
Right off in traffic I'm hoppin, that hatred up for adoption
'Bout to be relocated, play with me it can't be no option

[Hook: Price of Audio Push]
Me against the world but I still won't quit
Got it from the bottom so it's been a long trip
I had a lot of niggas, now I'm on my own shit
Had a few hoes but they wasn't on shit
They know I had a lot of wins, a couple L's
The money come, it never fails, they know it's all good
When the money gone, you see the real, they switching up
It never fails, but still it's all good

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Never ran from the opposition
Every opportunity I get to bomb, I'ma bomb on a pussy nigga
If you count pockets niggas better watch mine
Get money, get pussy, let my watch shine
Six figures for the show nigga
Get fifty for the after party and that's for the low nigga
You better hold them to your ho nigga
Fast money runnin' rappin' now she runnin' with a dope nigga
Two door rolls Royce nigga
Your man making payments, I just paid it off and gon paint it boy
Still text your old lady boy
She hit back everytime you land up in your lazy boy
Strip club, black bottle time to pour it up
Peep the weakness in the game I had to sew it up
Yeah, I had to sew it up
Get money, where you from nigga? Throw it up

[Hook: Price of Audio Push]
Me against the world but I still won't quit
Got it from the bottom so it's been a long trip
I had a lot of niggas, now I'm on my own shit
Had a few hoes but they wasn't on shit
They know I had a lot of wins, a couple L's
The money come, it never fails, they know it's all good
When the money gone, you see the real, they switching up
It never fails, but still it's all good

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Me against the world that's apparent to me
Okay my momma she ain't wanna be a parent to me
So I'm standing on the corner smokin' marijuana
Tryna get the package out to Carolina
They ain't 'bout the dinosaurs in the dope game
Lookin' for the doors to the room full of cocaine
All I ever dreamed
Was a beamer and a girl of the cover of a magazine
Extended magazine
On a chopper and a Glock forty and a mini fourteen
Fully automatic, let the motherfucker have it
Bet they paralyze him if they missin' no bustin' cabbage
I'm from Atlanta the real one
The place where you ain't gotta start a culture, steal one
Yeah, from where you can be the man 'til you kill one
And a bird ain't shit, until you deal one
Bankroll Mafia

[Hook: Price of Audio Push]
Me against the world but I still won't quit
Got it from the bottom so it's been a long trip
I had a lot of niggas, now I'm on my own shit

The money come, it never fails, they know it's all good
When the money gone, you see the real, they switching up
It never fails, but still it's all good
