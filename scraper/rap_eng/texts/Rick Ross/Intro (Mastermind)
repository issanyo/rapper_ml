"Push it to the limit"
"Everyday I'm hustlin"
"Ten years later time for me to cash out"

[Interlude: Napoleon Hill]
Now here are some interesting facts about the mastermind which give you an idea of how important it is and how necessary that you embrace this principal and make use of it in attaining success in your chosen occupation

First of all, it is the principal through which you may borrow and use the education, the experience, the influence and perhaps the capital of other people in carrying out your own plans in life. It is the principle through which you can accomplish in one year more than you could accomplish without it in the lifetime if you depend entirely upon your own efforts for success

There is no such thing as something for nothing. Everything, including your personal success, has a price that must be paid

[Outro: Rick Ross]
I just upped my stock, fuck them cops
If you love hip-hop bust them shots
