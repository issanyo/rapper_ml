[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Who you suckers think you trippin' with? Yes I'm the boss
745, white-on-white, that's Rick Ross
I cut 'em wide, I cut 'em long, I cut 'em fat
I keep 'em comin' back, we keep 'em comin' back
I'm into distribution, I'm like Atlantic
I got them pretty things flyin' across the Atlantic
I know Pablo, Noriega
The real Noriega, he owe me a hundred favors
I ain't petty player, we buy the whole thang
See most of my homies hustle, they still do they thang
My roof back (roof back), my money rides (my money ride)
I'm on the pedal, show you what I'm runnin' like
When they snatched Black, I cried for a hundred nights
He got a hundred bodies, servin' a hundred lives

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev-everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev-everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm, everyday I'm

[Verse 2:Plan B]
Yeah I'm always hustlin' blud
I'm hustlin' even when
I'm just sitting in the flat, sipping on a Jack, chilling with my girlfriend
'Cause I'm always on the phone like who? What? When?
What did you just say? Can you say that again?
What you motherfucking mean, motherfucker wants ten?
Motherfucker's supposed to be my motherfucking friend
Give him eight per cent and say that shit's peng
Considering that I'm still living in the ends
And I'm still driving in the same old banged out ride
Reg plate starting with an N
Looking at the Benz
And the BMs
Thinking: how come I ain't in one of them
Yeah my LP dropped blud, so what then?
Them there money's dried up since then
I'm still Ben
Same old little pink dicked white boy that I was before
Except now I'm a little less young
Little less dumb and a little less poor?
What's enough? More? Is it 'cause I think your tough enough or do I just know the score?
Blud, they can't say I ain't talented, all they can say is that I'm too raw
What's my name? Ben Drew, not Ben Draw
Still no-one backs me like Jo
Whiley, Ras Kwame or Zane Lowe
On BBC Radio
Who cares what that fat prick said he's pop
Yeah Chris Moyles - he had a pop
First him and now Tim, So what?
Neither of them got a clue about Hip Hop
Blud

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev-everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev-everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm, everyday I'm


[Bridge: Chris Martin]
Where do we go, nobody knows
I've got to say I'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev-everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev-everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm, everyday I'm
