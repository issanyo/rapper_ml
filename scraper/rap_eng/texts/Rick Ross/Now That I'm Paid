[Intro: Mele]
Now that I'm paid....
Whoooo

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Ridin' in a cab, but I'm dreaming on a slab
15 ounces at a time, pussy nigga, do the math
10 ice chains, prince like James
The day I made a stack in the trap, my life changed
Y'all rides swingers, we ride daytons
It don't matter where you from, haters stay hatin'
Keep the windows tinted, artillery when I'm in it
Whip it in the kitchen before Hillary became a Clinton
Assholes by nature, cash flows is major
In the old school, or M codes for kreggers (?)
Started with a crumb, and turned it to a brick
They were calling me a bum, my turn, I'm the shit
Razor flip things, age of 15 (hello!)
Parked the Chevy in that thing, glaze like Kris Kreme
Rolls on the wrist when the shows ain't exist
Now my money long enough to put my foes on a 6 (Bawse!)

[Hook: Mele]
I pull up front to the club with my doors to the sky
(Now that I'm paid)
I shut down the malls like a boss, 'cuz I gotta be fly
(Now that I'm paid)
I've got all the bottles I want, bottles I want to hit
I'mma do it 'cuz I've got all this money
Nobody gon' stop it (now that I'm paid)

[Verse 2: Game]
Duffles full of Franklins, carpooling with Bawse
Army medal on the burgundy Ghost, fuck what it cost
Umbrellas in the doors, Audemars in the dash
Wale in that Ferrari, but that Phantom on his ass
We gon' spend this money, it's whatever, let them things pop
Kids gon' be alright 'cuz Daddy invested in wingstop
Money and residuals comin' like it's a ritual
Drinking this liquid money, them bottles gon' be invisible
Fuck the rest of you petty cash niggas, I'm invincible
Glocks identical, remove niggas from the physical
Smokin' that dual exhaust, flossin', fuckin' them haters
And finger fucking the waitress while sipping this Ace Of Spades
I'm throwin' money for nothin', Hawaiian kush I be puffin'
Sharin' hoes with my crew while these other niggas be cuffin'
Know she love that money game, stay fuckin' with double M
Think a nigga about to put her in that bubble Benz
Don't let the devil in!

[Hook: Mele]

[Bridge 2x: Mele]
Fuck these niggas, we got all these hoes
(We got all these hoes)
All this money, let me put you on
(All this money in my hand)

[Hook: Mele]
