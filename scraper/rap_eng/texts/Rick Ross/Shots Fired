Slow down

I just heard a bunch of gunshots go off -- my server just left on her bike to go -- Oh my God, they're turning around and coming back

Okay

I'm hanging up, I'm hiding, bye--

Okay, m'am, how many shots did you hear?

I don't know, I don't know, but they're coming back. I'm hiding

"We're being told by people here on the scenes, specifically the manager that a famous rapper was riding in that car when someone opened fire shooting at that car, that car crashing into that building. Police cleaning up the shell-casing markings that were here just a few moments ago. This is still under investigation"

"There was a rapidfire 9 or 10, 9 or 10 shots. You know, rapidfire with rapid succession and odd enough it wasn't a handgun, it was some kind of a rifle."

"Police have leads, but no strong description of the shooter or the shooters who appeard to have targetted South Florida based rapper Rick Ross as he drove down the street"
