[Intro]
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League...

[Hook]
Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

[Post-Hook: Drake]
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I won't ever know
Uh, but here goes nothing...

[Verse 1]
Just me and my baby to fly
Oh, I just want to glide it out
Something like a Bonnie and Clyde
Oh, I just want to ride it out
Breeze into my kinky hair (Breeze in my kinky hair)
When do you [?]
This is how we take trips, ooh

[Pre-Hook - Lem Payne]
Aston Martin, you know we go hard
Let 'em push and park
Go and let up the top
Just me and my girl, yeah

[Hook]
Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway, just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

[Post-Hook: Drake]
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I won't ever know
Uh, but here goes nothing...

[Verse 2]
I'm not trying to be no one's star
Starter was assigned to me
I'm just trying to be who I are
The battle wasn't meant for me
I ain't trying to be the next baller
My top's down, I'm so cool
If you want, I can ride you too
Let's go make these moves

[Pre-Hook - Lem Payne (Chrisette Michele, Rick Ross)]
Aston Martin, you know we go hard
Let 'em push and park
Go and let up the top (Ballin')
(Let up the top...) Just me and my girl, yeah

[Hook]
Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

[Bridge - Lem Payne]
Top down, watch out
Ring on, rock out
Pop bottles, lay low
Drive slow, it's cops out
We fresh as Dove soap
The bomb like flat out
Aston Martin swag
Burn you on the track, flat out

[Outro - Chrisette (Lem Payne)]
Aston Martin Music, Music (Ha-ha-ha! It's LP!)
Aston Martin Music, Music Yeah...It's Chrisette Michele and Lem Payne on the track...
In Our Lives... Y'all might want to stand up...yep...
Aston Martin music, music
Aston Martin music, music That's the right music...
All Night...
Aston Martin music, music
Aston Martin music, music
In our ride
