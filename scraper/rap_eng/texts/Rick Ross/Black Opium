[Intro: The Crowd & Rick Ross]
Can I get a rozay (rozay)
Can I get a rozay (rozay)
Let me get a huh (huh)
Let me get a huh (huh)
Huh

[Hook:  Spliff Star and Baby Sham]
I do this for us
Stuck on the grind trying to elevate
I'ma stand as a man never above ya

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Shooters in a crowd, 50 carats, they givin' dab
My livestyle get busy,  you niggas really rare
Put my bitches on, get money, stay out the trap
Fuck 'em long, smoke a bong maybe go get a tat
No illusion, quarter millie for this whip I'm cruzin'
Caught a deal, hop a plane with Hov and I kept it movin'
Mob ties, Santeria, protect me from these shooters
Nice suits, so religious, these muthafuckers ruthless
Blonde broads, Cuban cigars, shit I get the true
Lucky suit, VIP, Double M, T.I. truth
Cap guns, stab wounds, they think we having fun
Doing shows, fucking hoes, Gunplay's still on the run

[Hook:  Spliff Star and Baby Sham]
I do this for us
Stuck on the grind trying to elevate
I'ma stand as a man never above ya

[Rick Ross:]
Some niggas choke, Some niggas don't
That, da-that, da-that, that, the last ganstas

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Pissing in portable potties out at the public school
Late to class, walk the halls then wanna run with tools
Say your name, what's your gang, my people wrote the rule
4th of July, light up the sky, step on my shoes
All I do is feed niggas and they call it food
That's my fool, I assume you know he in the room
You hear the boom, soul floating like a balloon
Fatal wound, if war niggas yell "I played the rules"
A lot of goons, cocaine bitches consume
Still fill the room, King of Diamond, go get the broom
Dreamchasers you fuck with Meek, you gotta fuck with Coon
Them my poon, they DC, carve it in my tomb

[Hook:  Spliff Star and Baby Sham]
I do this for us
Stuck on the grind tryna elevate
I'mma stand as a man never above ya
I do this for us
Stuck on the grind tryna elevate
I'mma stand as a man never above ya

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I only take time out for all my bad bitches
Ex-bitches, my last bitch was far from average
Fast whips, G wagon that's horse and carriage
Marriage is not for me I'm rich and careless
Ex-ex relax your under my mattress
40 blocks of white, that Marshall Mathers
8 mile, a while my shit was stagnant
Seven fifties do '8' figures, young nigga at it
Ho wow, ho now, they think it's magic
I bring the best out your bitch, she livin' lavish
Mink drapes, Prince cape and on my talon
The parallel, twist one for Khaled

[Hook: Spliff Star and Baby Sham]
I do this for us
Stuck on the grind tryna elevate
I'ma stand as a man never above ya
I, I, I do this for us
Stuck on the grind tryna elevate
The la, the la, the last gangstas
I do this, I do this for us
I do this for, for us
(Maybach  music)
