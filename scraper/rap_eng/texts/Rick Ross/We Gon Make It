[Verse 1]
Lil homies livin' like it's no tomorrow
Caught a charge smokin' large in a stolen car
He called his mom, guess he figured she would post his bond
Times have changed and she really runnin' low on funds
Hung up the phone, in the cell still in his Foams
Reekin' of the weed, that's all his money blown
Now it's time to tell yourself, nigga, "We gon' make it"
And 15 hundred cash, nigga, we gon' make it
A free felon on their ass, nigga, we gon' make it
Homie steppin' on the gas, nigga, we gon' make it
I told myself so many times, nigga, we gon' make it
Cryin' in the dark, nigga, we gon' make it
Countin' cash 6 days, nigga, we gon' make it
Let them haters be the haters, nigga we gon' make it
Put your back against the wall, nigga we gon' make it
And if you black, this for us all, nigga we gon' make it

[Chorus]
They say we just a bunch of thugs, don't stand for nothin'
Disgrace to our race, don't belong in public
It was us against the world from the first day
Let us bow our heads, may we all pray
Throwin' bricks at the man, we gon' make it
Genocide not in the plans, we gon' make it
Pray my son understands, we gon' make it
Know God holdin' our hands, we gon' make it

[Verse 2]
No power in December, nigga we gon' make it
Stove open, I remember, nigga we gon' make it
These the words mama whispered, we gon' make it
Still holdin' on my pistol, nigga we gon' make it
I seen a lot of niggas fall, still standin' tall
And a lot of people talk you've never seen talk
When your man testify, that's a coin toss
Never trust niggas, hit 'em with a moonwalk
Billie Jean, Billie Jean, oh Billie Jean
Say a prayer for my team, we gon' make it
Hold your head to the sky, we gon' make it
All my niggas gettin' high, we gon' make it

[Chorus]
They say we just a bunch of thugs, don't stand for nothin'
Disgrace to our race, don't belong in public
It was us against the world from the first day
Let us bow our heads, may we all pray
Throwin' bricks at the man, we gon' make it
Genocide not in the plans, we gon' make it
Pray my son understands, we gon' make it
Know God holdin' our hands, we gon' make it

[Outro]
Demonstrators jumping on police cars, setting some on fire, the city in rubbles, rubber bullet shooting chaos. Looters robbing stores in broad daylight
They sayin' we animals and we actin' like we ready to go 'head
If you don't bring him to justice, if you don't bring him to town square, you're gonna see all these people in your motherfuckin' neighborhood
