[Intro: Rick Ross]
Time is money, mind is funny
Trust me she lyin' if she denyin' she love me
Make up ya mind, you been on and off
Platinum Patr√≥n, come take shots with a boss

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
If you came to get the party started
Girl, just say "La-la-la-la-laaa"
I want to put my hands all over your body
Girl, come this way "Na-na-na-na-naaa"
What you gon' do-o-o
If I touch you, if I put my lips on you-ou-ou
If we took you back to the crib, just me and you-ou-ou
All night I want to play, just say "Na-na-na-na-naaa"
Just take off your coat and just lay back
All you gotta do is just lay back
Would you do this for me baby? Just lay back, lay back
"La-la-la-la-laaa"

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Girl, I'm bright as a bezel, and you sexy as ever
Shorty what's on your brain, cause whatever is clever
Number one at whatever, I get bundles of cheddar
This that black cloud you deserve wonderful weather
Run a few errands, summers in Paris
Never shoppin' in clearance, don't make me embarrased
She never a bird, but baby my parrot
Her flavor superb, I pay her with carrots
My house is her home, I made her a palette
Maybe bein' too modest, my shit more like a palace
Follow the waterfalls, as it makes you wetter
Shawty brace yourself, it's only gettin' better

"La-la-la-la-laaa"

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
See shawty laid back, so we laid up
When I fade to black, we always made up
This shit ain't made up, look what I'm made of
Look what I made brah, don't owe no favors
Have 700s, first one to get it
My car's a virgin, first one to hit it
Hit the rim shop, get 'em to the hood
Stop by her momma house, that's if I'm feelin' good
Now I need a fifth, time to hit the strip
I'mma hit the club, I'mma buy the VIP
We spendin' money, I'm talkin' slick
I hope she ride me, I'm talkin' stick

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I'm too tipsy to drive, she so sexy tonight
Man ain't treatin' you right, his bank account empty inside
Shawty you need a plus, you need a rush
No need to lie, baby you need to fuck

[Outro: Robin Thicke]
You came to get it started girl
Put my hands all over you girl
I touch you put my lips on you girl
Na-na-na-na-naaa
