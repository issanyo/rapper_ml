[Intro:]
Ugh, there he go, that's John Doe
There he go, that's John Doe
There he go, that's John Doe
Balling on you bitches like I’m Rondo

[Hook]
24s, John Doe
All gold, John Doe
Them boys dealing blow, they John Doe
Night work for the load, that’s John Doe
I'm still ballin' like I'm Bo Diddley
Ugh I’m still balling like I’m Bo Diddley
Ugh I parked the Caddy in the living room
Just parked the Caddy in the living room

[Verse 1]
I brought a Benz and it’s paid for
I brought a bitch that bitch paid for
I brought a stick as it's made for
Warfare yeah stick it in ya a-hole
Aye ho you know I got that A-1
Yayo and I’m quick to slang one
Jumping niggas like a chess piece
Spend a couple hundred dollars on my chest piece
Outta town niggas we call ‘em fresh meat
He say he nut in me boy you must refresh me
Better miss me with the convo
Wanna know my name bitch, John Doe

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got a bitch who has a habit
Spending stacks on nice fabrics
That head great, that pussy lavish
I’m peeling collard greens, to cut her carats
Reporting live from my Rolls Royce
I’m ready to die and put that on my old boy
Count 1.5 I holla “Oh Lord”
When I'm on the jet know them choppers on board
Rims taller than a bulldozer
Everybody tucking pistols when we pulled over
Fresh up out the fest, salute my nigga Fonzo
Yeah they asked my name but he told ‘em John Doe

[Hook] (x2)
