[Intro]
She's a
She's a
She's a
She's a
She's a
She's a
She's a

[Chorus]
She's my Girl Friday
She's my Girl Friday
I'm her Boy Wednesday
I'm her Boy Wednesday
She's my Girl Friday
She's my Girl Friday
I'm her Boy Wednesday
I'm her Boy Wednesday

[Verse 1]
Hello?
You are the one I wanna take out on the weekend
Oh, hi!
Do not pretend you wanna end what we got going
Okay
How about a movie?
Baby, tell me that you're free then
I'm sorry, but I think I got Tuesday and Wednesday open

[Pre-Chorus]
She's got things to do everyday of the week
While I'm just playing hide and desperately seek
I wait around the clock, but her calendar is blocked
I'm a hard place
And she's a rock, she's a rock

[Chorus]
She's my Girl Friday
She's my Girl Friday
I'm her Boy Wednesday
I'm her Boy Wednesday
She's my Girl Friday
She's my Girl Friday
I'm her Boy Wednesday
I'm her Boy Wednesday

[Verse 2]
I think we fell in love outside your favorite vegan spot
In a brand new Tesla, hotbox in the parking lot
Ooh, you look so hella sexy at Coachella
Ain't nothing wrong when you hit the bong and you wanna sing along
She's got things to do, she never stops to rest
While I am just trying, trying, trying to do my best
I rock the party hard at the biggest event of the year
I'll take you to the start, just lend me your ear

[Chorus]
She's my Girl Friday
She's my Girl Friday
I'm her Boy Wednesday
I'm her Boy Wednesday
She's my Girl Friday
She's my Girl Friday
I'm her Boy Wednesday
I'm her Boy Wednesday

She's my Girl Friday
She's my Girl Friday
I'm her Boy Wednesday
I'm her Boy Wednesday
She's my Girl Friday
She's my Girl Friday
I'm her Boy Wednesday
I'm her Boy Wednesday

[Outro]
Okay
She's a
She's a
Oh, hi!
She's a
She's a
Oh, hi!
She's a
She's a
Oh, hi!
She's a
