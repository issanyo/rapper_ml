[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Look in my pockets I see a lot of dead people
Wrist game mean, mother pearl so evil
Christian Louboutin, sucker for a sneaker
Pull up in Pakistan like I’m Evel Knievel
Elroy Jetson, I stay spaced out
Never lay my Jesus piece face down
It’s not a Rollie, I’m sorry this fucker run
She not a singer, but dammit I made her hum
Name Ricky but really I’ve been a Willy
See you looking at it but this watch a quarter milli'
I got houses, hobbies, homes in Abu Dhabi
Never go wrong GPS, my Ferrari
