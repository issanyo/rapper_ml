It wasn't supposed to go this way...

Every day I get up, shes on my mind
I can't get enough & I don't know why
But it's more than a crush
I can't believe it's getting deeper
All the time I wanna see her

But it wasn't suppose to go this way
She was suppose to be another game to play
And I can't figure it out
I don't know how she did it
But she made me fall, fall, fall

How do you find yourself
Inside of love (Inside of love)
With a girl that you met
Inside the club (Inside the club)
Never could that be me-Yeah
That was what I used to say
Until it happened just the same to me
I never thought it could happen to me
But these days I'm finding myself on the ground
And I just don't know how I got here
All I know is that I'm down & out

But it wasn't suppose to go this way (Go this way)
She was suppose to be another game to play (Another game to play)
And I can't figure it out
I don't know how she did it
But she made me fall, fall, fall

Have you ever met someone
That you thought was for the moment
Then they came & stole your heart
Before you knew that it was stolen
Took you by surprise
Cause you never saw it coming
And now I can't deny
That baby girl you got me fallin

But it wasn't suppose to go this way (Go this way)
She was suppose to be another game to play (Game to play)
And I can't figure it out
I don't know how she did it
But she made me fall, fall, fall

But it wasn't suppose to go this way (Go this way)
She was suppose to be another game to play (Game to play)
And I can't figure it out
I don't know how she did it
But she made me fall, fall, fall

How did I find myself inside of love (love)?
