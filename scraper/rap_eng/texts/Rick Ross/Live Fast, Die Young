[Intro]
And I wanna show you how you all look like beautiful stars tonight
Oh he sounding good!

[Hook: Kanye West & (Rick Ross)]
They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives
Well we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight
And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit
For the rest of our lives, so live fast (live fast)
And die young (die young), live fast (live fast)
And die young (die young), live fast, and die young

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Livin' fast, now it's all linen rags
Hard-headed, but my top peelin' back
Tinted glass on my '57, nigga wit' a attitude (Me)
Young and radical, methods are mathematical
Let my convertible marinate on the avenue
Mami, that's half a million, I'm livin' la vida rapido
Die young, but fuck it, we flew first class
Turned you to a rich bitch by your first glass
Up in this bitch and we lit up like a screen
Every time we hit the charts, niggas shoot up like a fiend
Stuntin' like we printin' money with machines
What you see me wavin', Vacheron Constantine
Like Mike, my Spikes stay all white
Twenty-four karat gold, eighty carats worth of ice
Ice insured, fuck life insurance
I live for the moment, and put a bullet on that (Bawse)
Got the club rockin' like a fuckin' boat
I'm the pirate on this ship, all you mates got to go
Good party over here, everybody over here
You know the word travel fast, everybody know we here
All the bottles over here, even spread it over there
All the models over here, but they swallow everywhere
She came to party like it's 1999
If she died on my dick, she would live through my rhymes

[Hook: Kanye West & (Rick Ross)]
They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives
Well we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight
And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit
For the rest of our lives, so live fast (live fast)
And die young (die young), live fast (live fast)
And die young (die young), live fast, and die young

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
For all my young ladies ladies that drivin' Miss Daisy
Drivin' me crazy, rock the beat, baby
Hop up out the (ERR!) she eat up the pavement
I don't give a (ERR!) baby, he crazy
I'm back by unpopular demand
'Least he still poppin' in Japan, shoppin' in Milan
Hoppin' out the van, screams from the fans
"Yeezy, always knew you'd be on top again!"
And we 'bout to hit Jacob the Jeweler
So I can be like Slick Rick, and rule ya
Dr. Martin Louis the King, Junior
And I'mma never let the dream turn to Kruegers
My outfit so disrespectful
You can go 'head and sneeze cause my presence blessed you
I mean, we walked in this bitch so stylish
Niggas done mistook me for my stylist
And I know it's superficial and you say it's just clothes
But we shoppin' in that motherfucker and they just closed
So go ahead and just pose
When she walked up out the dressing room, the store just froze
And I know they tryna get they cool back
And them ghetto bitches hollin' "How you do that?"
Uhh, so they could never say we never lived it
And if I see Biggie tonight, I loved every minute

[Hook: Kanye West]
They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives
Well we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight
And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit
For the rest of our lives, so live fast
And die young, live fast
And die young, live fast, and die young

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Peter Piper pickin' peppers, Rick pitch poems
My leather long enough to keep a thick bitch warm
When that ass is enormous, abs abnormal
And tans in the morning on sands in California
Seems like we gettin' money for the wrong things
Look around, Maseratis for the whole team
Look at Haiti, children dyin' round the clock, nigga
I sent a hundred grand, but that's a decent watch, nigga
I'm gettin' better, cause it woulda leased a drop, nigga
I'mma get my money right, just watch, nigga
She had a miscarriage, I couldn't cry, though
Cause you and I know she was only my side hoe
Uh, I got 'em catchin' amnesia
Time to pull my fuckin' minks out the freezer
See the lynx and you just think, "Jesus!"
I'm hot 'til the day they freeze us
Young and radical, methods are mathematical
I'm multiplyin' my money through different avenues
Took many to war, shook never before
For my mother I applaud Ms. Afeni Shakur
Ice insured, fuck life insurance
Three bad bitches, don't come concurrent
Still, you know the dope won't stop
And if I die today bury me in a dope-ass watch

[Hook: Kanye West]
They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives
Well we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight
And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit
For the rest of our lives, so live fast, and die young
Live fast, and die young, live fast, and die young
