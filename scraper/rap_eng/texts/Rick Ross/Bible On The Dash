Slanging girly in the morning early, got to catch the rush
M. O. B. And that’s a must, C. O. D. I got no trust
And I be B. M. F.’n, a million won’t last a month
All I need is one, P. N. C. And that’s enough
And I ain’t even crank up yet, but bet I’m gassing up
When my prada press that peddle bitch you better fasten up
I excel and ash the blunt, they hell a hundred times
That even one hundred-one couldn’t bring back how it was
When a brick was seventeen and you ain’t have to rob your plug
When rapping was an art, now the shit a jug
Bet you couple dollars, few jewels, and some pussy
I’m getting a little too power drunk, now I’m on that bullshit

[Hook:]
I got a problem and a plan, revolver in my hand
Trying to keep it cold, but y’all won’t understand
That’s why I roll, that’s why I roll with the bible on the dash
That’s why I roll, that’s why I roll with the bible on the dash
I got a problem and a plan, revolver in my hand
Trying to keep it cold, but y’all won’t understand
That’s why I roll, that’s why I roll with the bible on the dash
That’s why I roll, that’s why I roll with the bible on the dash

Cutting corner on corona’s, trying to buck up on a bonus
Out her on my lonely, last stogie but I’m focused
Now I know, friends parallel to foe
And all that good pussy leave you parallel to broke
I asked the pastor, what’s the fastest way to heaven for a bastard with a tarnished past, give me your honest answer
With all this hannah montana, without the arm and hammer
Am I going to get the slammer or the casket
Trying to keep a level head, rolling on this rocky road
This a full time gig, trying to keep this Glock cold
Got the work, water in the pot, need a hot stove
And a down ass bitch, and a squad down to roll

[Hook:]
I got a problem and a plan, revolver in my hand
Trying to keep it cold, but y’all won’t understand
That’s why I roll, that’s why I roll with the bible on the dash
That’s why I roll, that’s why I roll with the bible on the dash
I got a problem and a plan, revolver in my hand
Trying to keep it cold, but y’all won’t understand
That’s why I roll, that’s why I roll with the bible on the dash
That’s why I roll, that’s why I roll with the bible on the dash
