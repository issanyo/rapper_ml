[Verse 1]
I keep pimpin' to get in a bitch panties
I keeps spittin', the critics can not compare me
To put it simple I am Mr. Miami
And my lil' pistol will flip over ya, oh yeah
We the best, at best you doin' failin'
Straight finesse, had to swipe the balet
That's from sunset, we rippin' up Cali
Fuck the chips, I dip nigga be damned
Now I'm runnin' from the ghetto bird
I got food on my stomach from the ghetto birds
All I use are my ghetto words
I'm the mayor in the hood on the ghetto terms
I'mma get money, I'mma flash dough
Unique whips will cash grow
I'mma keep pimpin' to get in a bitch panties
Dead presidents are runnin' my family

[Hook]
Every dollar I get keeps me stuntin'
Kanye and these hoes tellin' me nothin'
I'mma keep pimpin' to get in a bitch panties
I put a hit on a nigga head, you hear me
Every dollar I get keeps me shinin'
I spend a million dollars, nigga just in diamonds
I done fucked every dime up in diamonds
This for them d-boys gettin' money, shinin'

[Verse 2]
Am I talkin' for police because I puff weed?
'Lotta artists some recorded as a puffy
Like a pimp I'mma skip, past the importer
Like a pimp order, pimp I import her
Every dime you give a note, that's a pimp quarter
'Cause every time she deliver like a pimp taught her
She ain't married to the game, just a pimp daughter
Every Benz that I gain, I get the limb harder
What the fuck you niggas know about loyalty?
Huh cuz, nigga you the fuss
Tell 'em what I said like I really give a fuck
And that big foot hoe, needed the hood
Derrick Henderson still sellin' his cars
Smelled his ass, know Ross just bought another garage
Yeah, yeah they wanna be the boss
But bitch niggas get twist in the cross
I'm the best

[Hook]
Every dollar I get keeps me stuntin'
Kanye and these hoes tellin' me nothin'
I'mma keep pimpin' to get in a bitch panties
I put a hit on a nigga head, you hear me
Every dollar I get keeps me shinin'
I spend a million dollars, nigga just in diamonds
I done fucked every dime up in diamonds
This for them d-boys gettin' money, shinin'

[Verse 3]
Thinkin' 'bout my bitch Kandice
Kandice was oh so romantic
Club grave, yeah I had cha both
While I made lil' Crissy roll up my smoke
Boss, I need more champagne
Lemonade piece niggas know my chain
Yeah I'm a millionaire, you wanna hold my chain
You could get a lil' pussy, nigga hold my name
Ross, yeah I go a long way
Well paid, baby girl let the song play
I'm lookin' for the Next Top Model
Gimme head on YouTube and then pop bottles

[Hook]
Every dollar I get keeps me stuntin'
Kanye and these hoes tellin' me nothin'
I'mma keep pimpin' to get in a bitch panties
I put a hit on a nigga head, you hear me
Every dollar I get keeps me shinin'
I spend a million dollars, nigga just in diamonds
I done fucked every dime up in diamonds
This for them d-boys gettin' money, shinin'

[Outro]
Shinin', you feel me
Shout out to that whole motherfuckin' 3-0-5 M.I.Yayo
Maybach Music, nigga
I am the CEO and we are sucker free, nigga
Y'all niggas, yeah we used to pay ya charge and car notes, nigga
We showed ya niggas love, ya feel me
But know it's time to stand on ya own two feet, nigga
It's like I fronted you a bird and you came back with two ounces, nigga
The fuck you think this is, this Triple C, nigga
Yeah like I said, baby
I got ten keys on my wrist so have you the D.E.A. tell 'em that
Boss
