[Intro]
Do your job and I'mma do mine
From the dice to the diamonds
Matchbox to the penthouse

[Hook]
They askin' questions and I heard they even lookin' for me
Ridin' up and down the block, they showin' pictures of me
Stash 100,000 in my momma china cabinet
First one with the Rollie with the hundred carets
I'mma make it work, I'mma make it work
Diamonds all on my hands, know I make it work
I'mma make it work, time to make it work
100 carets in the Rollie, I'mma make it work

[Verse 1]
Ain't no pressure to a boss, I gotta make it work
It's the see my niggas flossin', why we do the dirt
Bet a mili on the Dolphins and you know we lost
Run in the locker room like it was Set It Off
Dolphins 75% fuck all the politics
Better take us to the playoffs so I fuck your bitch
Shootin' dice with all my woes, we at the Superbowl
I'm like the title, I'm the one these niggas shootin' for
Obama let my niggas go, change all the crack laws
When movie come on boy, we rebuildin' the match box
On my knees at night, prayin' all my niggas safe
Ask God bless a nigga with a bigger safe
Blue cheese got it drippin' out the shoebox
Take off my shirt and show my abs like I'm 2Pac
I show my abs like I'm 2Pac
Take off my shirt and show my abs like I'm 2Pac

[Hook]
They askin' questions and I heard they even lookin' for me
Ridin' up and down the block, they showin' pictures of me
Stash 100,000 in my momma china cabinet
First one with the Rollie with the hundred carets
I'mma make it work, I'mma make it work
Diamonds all on my hands, know I make it work
I'mma make it work, time to make it work
100 carets in the Rollie, I'mma make it work

[Verse 2]
Pulled up in Miami and told you niggas I'mma do it big
Hundred rooms, still addin' on to my crib
Everybody take a loss, I gotta make it work
I done see niggas have to tuck in they shirt
I got the (?) my nigga I'm bout to flip again
Hundred mil off shore accounts and start over again
I blow the dice, drop the diamonds, and just let 'em roll
Got her heart beatin' fast but we fuckin' slow
Crippin' every major city, keep it to yourself
(?) young nigga wealth
Get me a motor with no trannie, I'mma make it work
Watch me pull up in a Caddy baller alert
It's a cold game, it's why we pull the minks on
Black market so we gotta (?) home
I'm on a different thing let these niggas sing more
The pinky ring, the diamond watch, the shit you (?) on

[Hook]
They askin' questions and I heard they even lookin' for me
Ridin' up and down the block, they showin' pictures of me
Stash 100,000 in my momma china cabinet
First one with the Rollie with the hundred carets
I'mma make it work, I'mma make it work
Diamonds all on my hands, know I make it work
I'mma make it work, time to make it work
100 carets in the Rollie, I'mma make it work

[Outro]

Rich niggas, rich niggas, rich niggas

(?) bitches bout to make it work
New York city in this bitch (?) make it work
