(Intro)
Can you smoke?
Never swim against the current
And they say the tide is rising
Uh, these niggas drownin’ to death
Where the lifeguards? We on the boat
Let these pussies know they got a rope
Or they want ya boy that threw a rope
Ah!

(Verse 1)
Successful nigga, pants hangin’ off my ass
King of diamonds, boy you better go and pay yo tax
Strong arm, robberies, but neva take advice
Not the type of brother that’ll read a book at night
He a fool, ain't he? Holla "Where that tool at?"
He-a move that, pocket full of food stamps
Niggas pray to see they seeds in the Ivy Leagues
But all I see is young teens on a Rikers team
Niggas throw a molly tryna get the lottery
I know she fuckin’ homie, shawty, don't you lie to me
You gon’ fall in and outta love a hundred times
Look at me, get yo money like I'm gettin' mine
Half these niggas jealous of that spot you in
Exercise the same muscle you know got you in
Caught him wit a block, my nigga had to plead a Ten
Stay alive through my rhymes until we meet again

(Verse 2)
Reminiscing on railings on my own, still jaded
Rest in peace a real nigga, we all real elated
It done been a couple years and it’s still raining
Everyday the sun shine, I know you still reigning
Suge got up on his shackles And that nigga fainted
2Pac triggerman, somewhere on his knees praying
Now it’s time for certain things to come to light
David Kenneth testifies against Mr. Knight
House cost 6, another 2 to paint it
Prayin' one day all my haters maybe get acquainted
No longer in the beef, now I'm on to Bison
Evander Holyfield, swear I really want to write him
To ask him how it feels, maybe vice-versa
To know a nigga, bought his crib with a nice verse
Hundred rooms all alone, still blowin’ dro
Black bottle, in my robe, do this for my WOES
