Yeah, na, na, na, na
Yeah, na, na, na, na

Now me, I'm the life of the party
A little bit of juice, little bit of the gin
A little bit of Moet, bottles of the Rose
Feel a little buzz then I'm gettin' it in
Now me, I get it in, I get it in
Me, I get it in, I get it in
Now me, I get it in, I get it in
Me, I get it in, I get it in

Look as soon as I step in the club
I swear, my nigga, you can feel the attention shift
Started around twelve, ended up around two
I better leave with more hoes than I came here with

I can't be responsible for what I say
Or I do when I talk intoxicated
Shorty say I told her I love her
I put her out the next mornin'
Sayin' bitch I must have been faded

I don't know what you heard about me
But the word about me is that I'm no trick
I'm no sucker, I'm no chump
I be in the VIP with my niggas 'round me
Sayin' y'all can have whatever you want

Me, I get it in, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in

I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty, give me a drink
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty, give me a drink

I hate to say I told you so
But I told you so, I go hard when it's time to play
Shorty get to droppin' it low
Like the dancers do in the Go Go in front of me

She know I like to see her dance
She get to breakin' it down, we get the bouncin' outta control
Because I got a hell of a flow
We got paper to blow my whole clique pop bottles galore

It's no secret the hood done peeped it
When we come through, son, we look like bread
My '89 grind make my old nine shine
Like we been movin' bricks 'round this bitch for years

I say, I get it in it's because I get it in
Now shorty there a eight but her friend near a ten
I finna spend my G, she fuck with me, I'm in to win
I'm cooler than her ma, then we do this shit again

Me, I get it in Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in

I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty, give me a drink
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty, give me a drink

Na, na, na, na, now me, I'm the life of the party
A little bit of juice, little bit of the gin
A little bit of Moet, bottles of the Rose
Feel a little buzz then I'm gettin' it in
Now me, I get it in, I get it in
Me, I get it in, I get it in
Now me, I get it in, I get it in
Me, I get it in, I get it in
