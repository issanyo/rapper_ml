[Intro: Rick Ross]
(Maybach Music)
It's no finales around here, baby
No finales (J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross & Ne-Yo]
Yeah, such a breath of fresh air
Get a blow job, have a seizure on a Lear
Or get a new car, I could lease it for a year
Or bring it back tomorrow, that's a lease that disappear
Count new money, peelin' out a venue
New Maybach after it was discontinued
Never question mine, my mind is so inventive
Quadrupled my net worth and threw in a few incentives
Maybach IV the allure that I adore
All money game, we got ones in the floor
See me on the wood, nigga, pause at the game
Two mil, the jewels, no flaws, ask them lames
Bow to the boss in the presence of a don
Started on the corner, nigga, didn't have a coin
Playin' my position for a club that I can join
Never in the draft, but that boy know he goin'
Throw me a bomb (Dreams), get me a brick
That's on the Quran, I'mma go and get the chips
Go and get a rental (Dreams), I got a cute bitch
She's showin' some potential, so we takin' trips (Ooh)
Nigga, assets last while memories fade
I'mma patch that ass, I don't get paid
I'm a Mike Tyson typer, typewriter sniper
Double M life 'til a nigga pay the piper
I love when the beat dip
Same way I love to see a ki' flip
Go and pay your mama house off
Get sucked off, shawty wipe your mouth off
I'm alive, you could never write the South off
South paw, box a nigga off like a outlaw
Quick thinker, big better shut your mouth boy
Black chips, gold bottles, ship it out raw
Pullin' up slow, look at that boy
Young B.I.G., Lil Kim on tour
Lil Cease with me, all the cheese with me
All the G's with me, Maybach Eazy-E

[Hook: Rick Ross & Ne-Yo]
(Oh-oh-oh)
The good times don't last long
Just rewind the last song (Ooh, ooh)
We all shared some great times (Uh, uh)
As I read some great rhymes (Ooh)
What we does, is what dreams are made of
Come and get this love, all of this love, aye

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
500 for the car that I got on the strip
That's another 100, what I got on my wrist
800 for the jar that I'm about to twist
It's a female strand, you know life's a bitch
As I get high, move my curtains to the side
Age like fine wine, ambitions they never die
Niggas get abused like boys at Penn State
Greatest that ever did it, decided my own fate

[Verse 3: Ne-Yo]
Dreams, everything we are
The life that we're living, baby it's ours
Dreams, money, homes, and cars
Baby that's a given
I'm talking 'bout every fantasy
Be good real with me
So don't miss something move, ayy
Baby, come with me and live the dream

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League (Maybach Music)
It's a whole 'nother different element
It's Maybach Roman numeral, four (Maybach Music)
You couldn't fathom this, you couldn't imagine this
You can't produce this, you won't reproduce this

[Bridge: Ne-Yo & Rick Ross]
I'll be dreaming of you, yeah (Ooh)
I'll be dreaming of you, yeah
Come and make it come true, ooh (Maybach Music)
I'll be dreaming of you (Maybach Music)
I'll, I'll (Maybach Music)
I'll be dreaming of you, yeah (Maybach Music)
I'll be dreaming of you, yeah (Maybach Music)
Come and make it come true
Rozay! Huh (Maybach Music)
I'll be dreaming of you

[Outro: L.A. Reid & Ne-Yo]
Yessir, this is LA Reid
Come and make it come true (Maybach Music)
It takes a boss to know a boss
I'll, I'll
It takes greatness to recognize greatness
Ricky Ross, the boss, Maybach IV
