[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
You only get one life
That's enough if you do it right
Opinions don't phase me
Your hate ain't gonna change me, no
But I ain't gotta explain myself to nobody

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
The swag non-stop, the paper won't quit
Yet it's fly nigga, how she wanna skate on my dick
The all black drapes, hollow wall full of safes
My gas on fleek, jet fuel for the weak
These niggas wanna tweet, my niggas wanna eat
Down south dope boy, D-boy, nigga eat
All red Yeezy's, women who be on TV
Guaps in the marble, only all down these zee-zigs
Tellin' jokes, blowin' smoke, the finest artichokes
Fine dishes, pretty bitches on our ghost spokes
I'm tipping through on my shorty, eyes look Tiffany blue
Methodous flows killing these niggas, christians approved
Very wild, no photos, these niggas rarely smile
Only problem is staying low while the paper pile
Scared to come to town, really? How you niggas sound
I get my bitch to come pick you up, just to gun you down

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
You only get one life
That's enough if you do it right
Opinions don't phase me
Your hate ain't gonna change me, no
But I ain't gotta explain myself to nobody

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Fame is a flaw, I give the game to you raw
Number one in the south, she can see that from afar
She can tell by the car, double R on the plate
Rolls Royce over those black market bumping in the rave
Bitch nigga with poor taste, starve while y'all ate
I put my niggas on, they got 20 more on the weight
We all gotta die so that's double M to the day
I know the devil try so I get on my knees and pray
Jesus still walks, we marchin' in a parade
Black and white holding hands
While letting that thing blaze
Pistol on my waist, I can feel a police chase
Homie cutting crack like home made cheese cake
I get right, I get it right, I double back, I get it right
We make mistakes, but baby now is the time to get it right
I see you on that Jeep, but really what you living like

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
You only get one life
That's enough if you do it right
Opinions don't phase me
Your hate ain't gonna change me, no
But I ain't gotta explain myself to nobody

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
My heart nickle plated, these haters they all hating
Hate to see me smile, hate to know I made it
Hate to see me toast with my niggas, I'm motivated
Hate to see me with these women at these publications
I still get it poppin', let me get them keys
I still do the proper, do the BET's
I still roll it proper, let my niggas feast
Still in that 'rarri blowing hella weed

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I'm doing big things, I got big dreams
Move out of my way, if you ain't for me
Feel like a winter, I put in work
So many years, man I deserve to be celebrated on every level
If you can't take it, that's your problem
I'm gonna thrive, I'm gonna shine
I'm gonna live my life

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
You only get one life
That's enough if you do it right
Opinions don't phase me
Your hate ain't gonna change me, no
But I ain't gotta explain myself to nobody
