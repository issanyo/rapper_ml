[Hook - Sample]
I'm just doin' my job, I'm just doin' my job heee
I'm just doin' my job, baby, I'm just doin' my job heee heee

[Intro]
This beautiful right here
The ladies gon' appreciate this one
This a beautiful record right here
The Louis Vuitton Don
What the call this one radio? GQ?

[Verse 1]
Listen baby here's the reason I've been missing lately
Making sure my lil' misses out here living gravy
Gray Mercedez, car note 980 it's no prob she so mob
And her brain is so crazy
"You a soldier, I feel you for that" is what I told her
Over the Motorola Rick Ross tatted on her shoulder
Club cray tongue kissing in a daze Cris twisting up the haze
Go to Space once the night is over
Fuck her fast even though I know she like it slower
Breakfast spot go to Jerry's right around the corner
Valet? The V12 pull it on the corner
I can't drive, I'm rolling still holding on the water

[Hook]
It's real radio right here
99 Jams, Power 96 show me some love man, show the boy love this Ross
Know what I'm saying cartel right here
Listen b, I'mma break it down I'mma be as clear as I can for you

[Verse 2]
Check it
Them other hoes are nothin' to lose sleep about
Your pink thong? Pull 'em to the side and eat you out
We make love I know you tired of that fake thug
Tired of the lies and bullshit that he makes up
He tuggin' on you whisperin' in your ear he's caked up
Has rims on his car but damn boo his brakes scrub
He fresh out look at me with his chest out
The car beam? Knocked his ass clean into the next house
He snitched on twenty niggas thought we'd never find out
You tryna be somebody else homie, time out
Them cartel boys down to pull them 9s out
From Boobie to Walk my dog gotta climb out

[Hook]
This should knock in clubs
Coming from a real gangsta artist, you know
Rick Ross, Triple Cs
You so sexy girl

[Verse 3]
You keep me in the mood
Once a nigga see you nude
Eat you like a plate of food
He move like them haters do
(Oh they hatin' too?)
Shit I know that cale dude
Hit 'em with a stray or two
Maybe take a day or two
Listen boo, the war's over we can chill now
Let's move to ATL: buy a crib, put a mill' down
Celebrate have Boozer bring them pills 'round
Bust a nut, pop a bottle, baby how you feel now?

[Outro]
I just want you to ride with me
Stay under my wing baby, I got you
I'mma make your last name Ross
It's a beautiful thing
See what I'm saying
Let's sit down and pop a bottle of purple hooter
You like to kiss?
I like to kiss you feel me
This beautiful right here, Rick Ross
