Caught 'em flippin', put the footage up on Youtube
I bought a Bentley, went and got that bitch new
Caught 'em flippin', put the footage up on Youtube
I bought a Bentley, went and got that bitch some new shoes
Caught 'em flippin', put the footage up on Youtube
I bought a Bentley, went and got that bitch some new shoes
Jimmy Ivine crib, when I'm in LA
Rick Rubin, line two, I do the deal with Dr. Dre

Caught 'em flippin', put the footage up on Youtube

Jimmy Ivine crib, when I'm in LA
Rick Rubin, line two, I do the deal with Dr. Dre
Bullet riddled car that very second, nigga life froze
Bend a corner, hop out on a whip with my ice on
Until we leave the club, can't even cut the lights on
And Reebok a quarter with a pair of mics on
In the streets, so hard to see I need some M3
Run up on 'em like a G, wet up your M3
Do a show at House of Blues just to throw the goons
Re-up on the ammunition, track next to the Catholic school
It's a perfect place and time for them Audemars
But if you study over time, this is the art of war
Maybach zepplin, stretch just like a limousine
Gotta rub it on her titties, then she feelin' me
Yeah, she feelin' me, them percocets be feelin' me
Go and purchase your momma house or face a penalty
Headshots, the bitches screamin' it's hell hot
Caught a case then I bought it out (?) out
Free my niggas and the legends still in the jail house
50 million now they monitor all my whereabouts
Kilo flip in exchange for a casino trip
Money launder, we double back and do it once again
Heavenly Father, please forgive me for all my wrongs
Niggas murdered over lyrics they're hearin' in my songs
Pop bottles, steve bottles, I'm talkin' bigger cream
Jamaica, Queens, signin' autographs for the fiends

[Outro: 50 Cent]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed
Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither
We in the club all the time, so pop, pop of
