Ain't got no pie for you
Im so hungry to eat
I want your meatloaf and dinner roll
And pig's feet
I got my eye on food
I really need to eat
I want your greens and macoroni
And cheese
It tastes so good girl and you know it
Better keep that chicken from 'round me
Cause it tastes so good girl and you know it
And you probably won't get a piece

CHORUS
If I'm hungry I'll eat it all
If I'm hungry I'll eat it all
I'll just leave you the bones
If I'm hungry I'll eat it all
Probably even the bones
