[ Verse 1: Rick Ross ]

I barely fuck with these niggas, cuz im fuckin with money
Cuz when you fuckin with niggas, you be fucking up money
Barely fuck with these hoes, im just fucking these bitches
Cuz when you fuck with these hoes, you be fucking up business
My niggas poppin them pills, you know that shit get addictive
I get it popping for real, bitch I got my prescription
Bitch I got me a plan
Bitch I got a connect
Bitch I got me some work, went and got me a check
Cuz I be hustlin
Musclin'
Nigga I'mma soldier
Cut throat, in the fields
Still ain't trustin no bitch or no nigga
Ho or no sucka, label or cracka
This fat muthafucka
Just hustlin get it on the muscle
Throwing up signs for them niggas that I fuck wit
Wrong one to fuck wit
City on my back
Like thats tatted on my stomach bitch we can run it
