[Hook (Jake)]

Damn it's too late yeaah
What do you want bitch
If you're sorry yeah
That's a good end

[Verse 1 (Jake)]

My heart cry and that's why I said "bye"
I'm single ... I don't know why
Watch me, tell me and please hear me
I can't say "I'm sorry" that's not really me
So many girls in the party talk with me
But I miss you but fuck you, now I hate you
My friends tell me to forget, but you are not my target
If tomorrow I die, don't come to funerals
Think about your life and tell me what is best without me
So clearly, seriously, now you're very less pretty
Oh no !!! I lie I lost my mind
I'm ready to smoke I want to overlook
When I'm high I can think about you, it's better
I confess, without you I'm stronger

[Hook (Jake)]

[Verse 2 (Jake)]

Now I see my future, I can be more mature
And all of my lyrics fuck all of your pics
Tonight I can be happy, like all girls with me
I want to smoke I want to drink, I love some joke I love some link
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear
No I can't cry, I don't lie, I just want be hight
In 2 days I forgot you, It's too late... Fuck you

[Hook]

[Verse 3 (Rick Ross)]

We never steal cars but we deal hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it, real hard
I caught a charge, I caught a charge
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it, real hard
Ain't bout no funny shit, still bitches and business
I'm on my money, shit, still whipping them Benzes
Major league, who catching
Because I'm pitching
Jose Canseco just snitching because he's finished
I feed em steroids to strengthen up all my chickens
They flying over Pacific to be specific
Triple C's, you know it's back, we holding sacks
So nigga go on, rat, run and tell em that
More cars, more hoes, more clothes, more blows
