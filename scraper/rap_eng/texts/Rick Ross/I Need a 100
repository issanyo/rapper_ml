Hook (Rick Ross):
I need a 100 black coffins
For a 100 bad men
A 100 black graves
So I can lay their ass in

I need a 100 black preachers
With a black sermon to tell
From a 100 black bibles
While we send dem all to hell

I need a 100 black coffin
Black coffin
Black coffin (Oh Lord)

Verse 1(Boss-Thug):
Yeah I choose to be bad
Cos everybody around me
Was too good for my liking
(Yeahh Nigga)

I smoke w**d and cigar
So am quick to socializing with
The badest niggas

First let me explain
That am just a black man
And I come from the dark side
So am having a hard time

To cope with the light
I had a bloody accident
That really made me panic
So I took my car to the mechanic

From hell to living well
So Mr. punk police ring the bell
And let my homies out the cell

I reminisce all my past crimes
Its sincerely the last time
We are soljas of ourtime
The only time we really kill
Is when we kill each other
(Yeah)

Verse 2(Boss-Thug):
Somebody tell Mr. Makavelli
To pick up his call
I still miss him and B I double G I

Its the reason I been rolling solo
Balling in my neighborhood
Screaming YOLO

You only live once
I'll ride for the cause
Yes I'll die for the cause

Am not having a good welfare
So permit me to say farewell
I hate to tell good people bad news
But I do's what I does

Its the reason am the boss
I got no battery but am always in charge
So if you wrong me and say sorry

I forget in a hurry
And tell you not to worry
While I pull up my lorry
So I can pick up the
100 black coffin for the 100 bad men
