[Intro: Elijah Blake]
M-M-M-M-Maybach Music
(Get money, get money)
Girl I think you're special
Strictly presidential (get money), yeah

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
You know the crib on the water now
The Maybach stay watered down
Project niggas givin' orders now
The gold Presidential just to sport around
I'm from the era of fitted caps and rental cars
Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads
Walkin' on Jewish marble, hand painted the ceilin'
Happy Hanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feelin'
Got my seats on the wood, playas givin' me dap
Lyor like how I move, Warner right in my lap
I made a few mils, ain't mentionin' Meek
Went and bought a new crib, week of Wale release
Bitches, the king comin', Billie Jean thumpin'
I need to hear the trumpets, meanin' machine gunnin'
I ain't missin' nothin', got her sippin' somethin'
I could ship her somethin', you know that December comin'

[Chorus: Elijah Blake]
Girls and green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's (get money) who we are, baby (get money)
All I ever need is girls and green (get money)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Ugh, may see me leanin' in some new shit
Now it's gold Presidentials for the crew shit
Threesomes, weed crumbs on the cruise ship
I'm a boss have you ass on a news clip
She a dime but she gotta be a cool bitch
Pony tail, red nails, still in school bitch
Needed some cash so she asked me could she move shit
Not a chance, whips got her talkin' foolish
I was skippin' the classes, but I got me a master
I was gifted at math, always counted the fastest
Fishscale made me major profit margins
I'm a prophet stuffin' my pockets, you niggas starvin'
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm with this pretty bitch
80 grand, rubber band for some silly shit
She on that Alexander Wang
Gold Presidential VS when I change the game

[Chorus: Elijah Blake]
Girls and green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's (get money) who we are, baby (get money)
All I ever need is girls and green (get money)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Ugh, she wanna roll with a winner now
So I let her roll with the windows down
My nigga's up the road come and get it now
60-40 no we split it up the middle now
Shawty's said the word, I was talkin' that talk
Maybe link up New York, that's awesome as fuck
I never been in love until I heard a beat
She never met a G until she heard of me
3rd floor projects, feel my point of view
Everything is number 2, that's when it come to you
Isabel Marant sneakers 'til the summer through
Fuck you on a yacht is what I wanna do
Ugh! Baby girl got that wet wet
I repeat: wet wet
I'm the boss and I'm on that
(I love you..) white tee, gold Rolex

[Chorus: Elijah Blake]
Girls and green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's (get money) who we are, baby (get money)
All I ever need is girls and green (get money)

[Outro: Rick Ross, Elijah Blake & Both]
(Maybach Music)
Her shoe game remarkable
I feel solely responsible
I feel solely responsible (Maybach Music)
I feel solely responsible, oh oh
