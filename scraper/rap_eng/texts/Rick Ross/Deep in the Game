[Hook: Rick Ross]
Deep in the game, I dun perfected my moves
My jewels drip like ice
My dogs rich off white
(4X)

[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
I say my wrists all white, rich off white
Nigga baby mother sucking dick all night
Thirty sixty clip by clip my clique gon roll with the foes (or fours?)
Them O's on the stove have my bitch on swole
Working with finesse I got success in the Lex
But then she got me locked up I can’t stop rolling with weps
First the body drop and then she showered the specs
I’m shaving off the top, I probably chop up ex
84 my kinfolk, NYC got Benning Road
Ridin' with that chopper, that’s my white bitch from Minnesota
I’m high, my price low, All State like Geico
Raw dog your household
Hog tied, like so

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fat Trel]
Take a niggas life like it’s alright like it was right
Had this quarter back to pack, grip it tight that’s bout the white
We’re polite, you can’t shop with me unless you shop with twight
And my lawyer is magnificent, I beat the charges twice
What you like
If I want your bitch I take her home tonight
Make her suck on this Ciroc, heard the pussy some slice
Then it’s right, I just turn and fly away like the kite
Bring her back to bat cave, and I bet she take the flight
Right left wrist working different with the ice
I just hurt the nigga eye, told that bitch turn on the light
That’s aight every now and then she like to fuck a dike
Then she bring it straight to me, I just bench her to the right
Like "what you like?"
