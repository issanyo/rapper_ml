[Intro]
You told lies, I told lies
I made mistakes, you made mistakes
But it is the love, Am I alone?
I apologize, you can put it all on me girl

[Verse 1]
My feelings hard to articulate, it goes for love and the trigger play
They watch the watch, and they watch the trinkets
While I'm forced to watch, you niggas ship sinking
Stressing me with an eviction note
So I bless them with a different flow
Now was in the Views of Time magazine
Fell in love with ace of diamonds, but I pulled the queen
Every day we find a new exception to the rule
Face the music, never met a chick I didn't lose
Shorty you can keep the bags and shoes
It's only right cuz the side piece got em too
Floor seats, I really took her to her first game
She was so excited got me like, poor thing
Now she realize she was counting up the chum change
Rolling Stone, Meek and Wale on the front page
Double M so success is synonymous
It's my first single, all I preach is the prominence
Everyday I hustle and the devil pulling at you
On his girl page and he won't put it past you
Double M so success is synonymous
It's my first single, all I preach is the prominence
Double M so success is synonymous
It's my first single, all I preach is the prominence Everyday I hustle and the devil pulling at you
On his girl page and he won't put it past you

[Verse 2]
Not to mention both car notes past due
Ten band on a nigga still pass through
You only trill ï»¿as the niggas that you signed to
20 Mill before I ever seen the iTunes
I'm Barry White in a all white
A curly perm wet for the whole night
I'm 2Pac cuz I got juice, Standing on the mountain top
Chocolate Yeezy boots, let the strings drag on the Earth
Let your queen drag on the purp
Spend a clean stack for the syrup
I sip it slow when I'm feeling nervous
I got fucking in our flight plans
She let me tap it in the air, I get her romance
Passion marks to the Saint Lawrence
Saint Barts, we could stay for months
Away off like the billboard rap list
On the Island seen 2Pac at the last gig
Real niggas and they stranded out of death row
Car full of bitches, on the way their favorite dej loaf
Flight club, the Supremes on, I need queens with the kings like Supreme on
Now you see the M.O.B, pinkie rings on
Take you [?], held us down to the Team strong
The Black Market is for the few of us, the two seat it's just the two of us
Back away you never move us
Renzel, motherfuck lucifer
