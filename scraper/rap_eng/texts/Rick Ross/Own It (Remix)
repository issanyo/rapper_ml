[Intro: Rick Ross]
Mastermind! Ricky Rozay! Double M! (Maybach Music)
I got it! I got you homie! Uh!

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
On the corner I'm followed like I'm in Barney's
A belt like a brick now these people all on me
Haters wanna harm me, Navy and the Army
Split your six bitch Fitch Abercrombie
D boy cheddar, kin so leather
Maybach Music, Rolls Royce weather
She my dream girl, my Faith Evans
Shotgun, in my new seven
Standing in the rain screaming put the kid on
Throw the peace sign praying that you live long
Beard long like the Nation Of Islam
Income that'll make ends and get some
Residuals is what a nigga live for
Ridicule I never had a feel for
The realtor said I was a real boy
Hard cash then the fat boy peeled off
Chrome wheel speeding down the dirt road
Mastermind all white minks on
Uh! Minks on! Rozay hold 'em up
Let's go!

[Verse 2: Mack Wilds]
Nothing's too much
Words that I live by
And that's just how I do, do, I do
I'm young right now
But I won't be forever
So I'm a live it up like that's true
You might wanna roll with me too

[Pre-Hook: Mack Wilds]
Said I don't mean to brag
But I live a life that most can only dream about, yeah
So baby come be my dream girl
Pick a fantasy and let me work it out, yeah, oh yeah

[Hook: Mack Wilds]
Tell me where you wanna go
What you wanna do
Said we living it like we own it
Own it, own it
Said I'm on top of the world
And what I need is you
Said we living it like we own it
Own it, own it, own it

[Verse 3: Mack Wilds]
Its never too much
So just let the drinks flow
Later on you can come through
Through, come through
You know you're the flyest
They should call you your highness
And call me king cause I'm that dude
All you gotta do is leave your crew

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Bridge: Mack Wilds]
What you talkin' bout?
We run this town
We got it sewn up
Because we own it
What you talkin' bout?
You deserve this crown
We got it sewn up
Because we own it
Because we own it

[Hook]
