[Verse 1]
Chain swinging on me every time I walk through
Black Ts bodyguards for your lawsuits
At the office bitches walking through and
Oak one six clips in the carpool
Real bosses get money and we never beat
We drop a bag and we let the killers clip freeze
Am talking money, we go bust down the Buhdahcon
I know the chef, I got them cooking up they two for one
How they got another wire nigga, street ready for me
Got them back on fire nigga, net worth through the roof, now we in the stocks
Never limb champs for their bandage these bitches on the block
Third generation hustle and I'm proud on
Smile looking at the stash, it's pile high
Go and get your mamma house, not a stunt nigga
Cost me a quarter mil to live every month nigga
Flashbacks of a dough seen, purple frozen cuts
Talking heavy Codeine, how am balling back in '03
Sitting on gold days, where them yo seen
I got a chopper, fuck the police
Chopping on the black market, yeah that boy a beast
I charge them extra for the air lift
Had to put the elevators in the last crib
Weighed Nassa for my niggas at the mansion
Weighed Nassa for the Muslims at the mansion

[Outro]
Shout out to all my niggas man
Pray for passion, huh uh
