[Intro]
One way in one way out

[Hook]
Ain't no U turns on the block
It ain't no U turns on my block
Ain't no U turns on my block
Ain't no U turns on my block
It ain't no U turns on my block
It ain't no U turns on the block
Ain't no U turns on the block
It ain't no U turns on the block
It ain't no U turns on the block

[Bridge]
Switch sides? You better stay there
You switch sides? You better stay there
Switch sides? You better stay
Switch sides you better stay there
You switch sides? You better stay there
Switch sides? You better stay there

[Verse 1]
Tunnel vision, it's time to stumble on 100 million
I still remember niggas pissin' in the project buildings
It's do or die, mama say can't have no feelin's
Cause the pretty boys in caskets never been appealin'
That diamond ceilin', all you hear is SUUUU
It got the bitches like OOOOO
Photographic memories, millionaire tendencies
I still be havin' dreams of niggas killin' me
Switchin' sides, you should be happy just to be alive
40 shots ready to show you niggas how we ride
Weather man weapons we use, them bitches never jam
Walk up on you, pull up on you, won't leave no evidence

[Hook]
Ain't no U turns on the block
It ain't no U turns on my block
Ain't no U turns on my block
Ain't no U turns on my block
It ain't no U turns on my block
It ain't no U turns on the block
Ain't no U turns on the block
It ain't no U turns on the block
It ain't no U turns on the block

[Bridge]
Switch sides? You better stay there
You switch sides? You better stay there
Switch sides? You better stay
Switch sides you better stay there
You switch sides? You better stay there
Switch sides? You better stay there

[Verse 2]
Pretty bitches sellin' pussy, I wanna buy it out
Real bitches ride with their man, that shit be right or wrong
I got you suckin' dick while daddy write a song
Went and got you that G Wagon just to ride along
These niggas hatin' just like throwin' stones
Might have one of my Haitians layin' in your lawn
So stop, I say all belongin's I confiscate
He sat it down then he thought he could walk away (no)
It ain't no U turns on my block, it ain't no U turns on my block
Ain't no question he was shot
That's how they do it on my block
40 rounds all in his car, huh

[Hook]
Ain't no U turns on the block
It ain't no U turns on my block
Ain't no U turns on my block
Ain't no U turns on my block
It ain't no U turns on my block
It ain't no U turns on the block
Ain't no U turns on the block
It ain't no U turns on the block
It ain't no U turns on the block

[Bridge]
Switch sides? You better stay there
You switch sides? You better stay there
Switch sides? You better stay
Switch sides you better stay there
You switch sides? You better stay there
Switch sides? You better stay there
