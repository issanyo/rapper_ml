(Zeeeeen!)
Aye, Rvssian!

[Chorus: Konshens]
We about that money dawg ain't nothing funny
We about that money dawg ain't nothing funny
Man haffi get the bread got to get the bread
Haffi get the bread got to get the bread
We about that money dawg ain't nothing funny
We about that money dawg ain't nothing funny
Man haffi get the bread got to get the bread
Haffi get the bread got to get the bread

What a fuck when the plane go land inna babylon
Man from the Caribbean with a money plan
Come fi take every fucking coin every dolla sign
We no itch
When a money time that deh pon wi mind

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Bully beef to a Bentley
Bully beef to a Bentley
Bully beef to a Bentley

Woah big belly man
You know the don
Rolex on ma arm
I keep my soldiers armed
Stack my first
I'm living long
So many lows
You only hear it once
She my baby gyal
She she my baby gyal
Me a di biggest boss
Now say it loud
You can call my phone
When you feel alone
I'm all about the change
But i love this one big belly
I love this one big belly
I love this one big belly
Big belly I love this one

[Chorus: Konshens]
We about that money dawg ain't nothing funny

Haffi get the bread got to get the bread
We about that money dawg ain't nothing funny
We about that money dawg ain't nothing funny
Man haffi get the bread got to get the bread
Haffi get the bread got to get the bread

[Verse 2: Rvssian]
Bruk the bread till is crummy
Damn I'm getting chubby
Never been a dummy nothing funny fi di money
From G-Shock to Rollie
Producers can't hold me
I do it so easy is like a field without a goalie
Skele pon mi wrist
Looking like a coffin
Bank know me name cause me deh in deh so often
Live inna the streets feeling like an orphan
I just level up mighty mighty morphin

[Chorus: Konshens]
We about that money dawg ain't nothing funny
We about that money dawg ain't nothing funny
Man haffi get the bread got to get the bread
Haffi get the bread got to get the bread
We about that money dawg ain't nothing funny
We about that money dawg ain't nothing funny
Man haffi get the bread got to get the bread
Haffi get the bread got to get the bread

[Verse 3: Konshens]
Where we come from
We nuh see too many rich
None a me dawg dem a nuh pussy
None a me dawg dem a nuh bitch
Nuff head we see get buss
Nuff body find inna ditch
Man nuh know fi hold it out pon di battlefield and don't switch
Cause anywhere you par you can fall
Nuff time me see mama bawl
Nuff war man splash pon wall
Inna war zone road a crawl
Before you come out you got to make a call
Weh di man a par wid di ting dem weh tall
Wi nuh left dem inna cabin at all

What a fuck when the plane go land inna babylon
Man from the Caribbean with a money plan
Come fi take every fucking coin every dolla sign
We no itch
When a money time that deh pon wi mind

[Chorus: Konshens]
We about that money dawg ain't nothing funny
We about that money dawg ain't nothing funny
Man haffi get the bread got to get the bread
Haffi get the bread got to get the bread
We about that money dawg ain't nothing funny
We about that money dawg ain't nothing funny
Man haffi get the bread got to get the bread
Haffi get the bread got to get the bread
