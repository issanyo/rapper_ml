[Verse 1: Stacy Barthe]
Don’t it seem like every time you try and progress
Something’s always holding you back
Waiting on line for my piece of the pie
But there’s none left
They told us none left, no
My people just tryina get by
But the devil all in the way
We’re just tryina live right
But the devil all in the way

[Hook x2]
They say we living in hell here
Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah

[Verse 2: Stacy Barthe]
When will all this senseless violence end?
When will it be safe for people to live again?
Tax the poor almost half to death while the rich live lavish
We’re just dying to live

[Bridge 1]
People just tryina live right
But the devil all in my way
We’re just tryina live right
But the devil all in the way

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]
I know a place, where ain’t nobody crying yeah
I’ll take you there
Hey, I know a place, where ain’t nobody dying yeah
I’ll take you there

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Father which art in heaven
Hallowed thy be thy name
Fire all in her eye, coming to take the flame
Qualified as a boss, katanas when in Qatar
Sock over the sneakers, she with me I’m dippin hard
Got me runnin' the streets, tell me sky is the limit
Praying I’m going to heaven or God make me a tenant
Seen some hard times, but really we all fine
Till the day that I’m gone
Just know that the game mine
Felon of fell in love, know the devil’s a liar
Beautiful is today, can’t imagine tomorrow
Beautiful is today, can’t imagine tomorrow

[Bridge 1]
