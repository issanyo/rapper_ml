[Hook: Supa Cindy]
Her jeans tight, and that ass right, that's Supa Cindy
Pulled up in that new Bends, that's Supa Cindy
And she flying a G-5, that's Supa Cindy
Walkin up in the offace, seeing Supa Cindy
Ballin and shoppin, a bad bitch, that's Supa Cindy
New contract like Tom Brady, that's Supa Cindy
Number 1 champ, that's Supa Cindy
Pussy good, that's that Supa Cindy

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
If she a bad bitch, I gotta call her Supa Cindy
She bought a dimb for a Roles, gotta call her 2 for 20
Spillin Champagne in the club, hope you won't get offended
20 forans in the front, we know who really with it
The ones who talk the most, boy won't spend a penny
Hating, while I got Cindy waiting in that Lamborggeeni
If her ass fat, you gotta call her Supa Cindy
If it's a Chanel bag, you gotta keep it trendy
Send the Chevy to Freddy, tell him hit me when you're ready
Quarter cash, in the trunk, that boy goin do the dash
If she got a pretty ass, you gotta call her Supa Cindy
And you know who got that bag, that's Supa Cindy

[Verse 2: Supa Cindy]
Supa Cindy that's a bad bitch, blow a big bag in Memphis
Pull up stuff at the Rits

Wearin two-pieces
New watch, fludded like the river
Kill bitches, murder murder, Supa Cindy on you hoes
Super fly, Fendy, Faragomo, wish a pussy nigga would
Pull up in the Maybac
All the bad bitches run up on me, knowing I got super cash in my walet
Maibac a trending topic, Supa Cindys, know they watching
All the real niggas need a supa Cindy
Bad bitch, just to run the city
Them hating hoes out there, know they watching
