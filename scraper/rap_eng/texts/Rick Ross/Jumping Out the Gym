[Intro: Rick Ross]
Got that A-1 Yellow to jumping out the gym, nigga
Lebron whaddup, D. Wade whaddup
It's the CREAM team, nigga!
50 racks a shift, three shifts a day, nonstop

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Michael Corleone, Vito Andolini
Godfather, bitch, no nigga can see me
I'm mobbing in the streets like my name is Capone
Fuck the rap game, soon as my niggas come home
20 mill, stuffed in 20 Nike bags
Balling like I'm Michael Jackson, I'm a psychopath
My black Lexus got another stash in it
Glock 40 for the shawties with the bad business
A-1 Yellow, got that jumping out the gym
Jumping out the coupe, why you think they after him?
Jumping out her panties, then she jumping on a dick
First 20 stacks a nigga get, he jumping on a brick
