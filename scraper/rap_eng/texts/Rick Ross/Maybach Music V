[Intro]
What is this?
Maybach Music
I like this Maybach Music
(Sweet!)

[Chorus: Katt Rockell]
And we lie together, cry together
And I swear I hope we fucking die together
And I'll be loving you forever
You're all that I need to get by

[Verse 1: DeJ Loaf]
I used to play hard to get, like a sample on a hook
We used to play with the pots, you told me you was a cook
I was runnin' too long, he was chasin', didn't trip
How'd he do it? I don't know but somehow I got hooked
Thug passion, he's so compassionate
MMG, yeah, that's his acronym
Call him D-A-D-D-Y like I'm in a bassinet
He in pieces, he be all up into my fashion shit
Hold on, poppin', rockin', my panties, they match my slips
Been through it all; I could give a narrative
No fiction, nah, we ain't no characters
I mean if I bust my gun, you gon' bust yours too
Type to double up, you know that I ain't gon' fuck the budget up
Type of bitch deserve it all, who gon' compete with her?
He use to have a cold heart, cold heart
Now my ring finger doin' the double dutch

[Chorus: Katt Rockell & DeJ Loaf]
And we lie together, cry together
And I swear I hope we fucking die together
And I'll be loving you forever
You're all that I need to get by
(You're all I need) Dream together, scream together
(You're all I need) And if we go to war, fuck the world together
(And if we go to war) And I'll be loving you forever
(Fuck the world together) You're all that I need to get by
You're all that I need to get by
You're all that I need to get by
You're all that I need to get by
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Post-Chorus: DeJ Loaf]
Let the dog roam, he found his way back
Loyal to the soil, I never change that
We go way back, I can take you way back
Used to ride Chevy's only now we in the Maybach, yeah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Caramel, she ride on top like it's a carousel
So infectious, I'm addicted, how would she ever fail
All my works are classic, maybe this my magnum opus
Too focused to give pussy to one of my soldiers
The loyalty is deep, she my Meryl Streep
My Michelle, we menage, do that through the week
On the phone, she had me listenin' to Boyz II Men
I'm tryna be at all the dope boy events
Food stamps now we dinin' on islands
Diced pineapples, now she's my pi√±a colada
Put my coattail on my dawg I thought was my rider
Every day he wore a wire just like his designer
Some things are meant to be, some thing are meant to be
The day they sentence me, show me no sympathy
If it's the Lord's will, so be it, that boy been a 'G'
Huh, that boy been a 'G' (Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Katt Rockell]
You're all that I need to get by
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Post-Chorus: DeJ Loaf]
Let the dog roam, he found his way back
Loyal to the soil, I never change that
We go way back, I can take you way back
Used to ride Chevy's only now we in the Maybach, yeah

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
She full of confidence, we compliment each other
Got my pistol in her purse so she a cocky nigga
She tatted up and way too trill for cover ups
We both winnin', that's even when it's one of us
We switchin' cars right before the summer comes
She my people so I'm beefin' when that trouble come
Kissin' in the club, I'm grippin' on your hips
I'm richer than before; I hit a couple licks
Travelin', I leave the keys to all the cars
The hallway just like walking through the rainforest
Before producers started sendin' tracks
Once was a dependent on the income tax
You did the math and said you'd give me half
It was genuine when we would interact
So when I got the bag, I had to double back
Let go a milli, shit, it made me off a couple racks (Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Katt Rockell]
You're all I need to get by
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Post-Chorus: DeJ Loaf]
Let the dog roam, he found his way back
Loyal to the soil, I never change that
We go way back, I can take you way back
Used to ride Chevy's only now we in the Maybach, yeah

[Outro: Rick Ross, DeJ Loaf & Katt Rockell]
There go that nigga, swim with the big fish
It's that Chanel music
Let the dog roam, he found his way back
Givenchy
Loyal to the soil, I never change that
We go way back, I can take you way back
Used to ride Chevy's only now we in the Maybach, yeah
It's priceless
I'd rather you than me
That's all it is
(You're all I need to get by)
