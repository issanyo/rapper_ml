[Intro: French Montana]
Nigga walk up in the spot
Wearin’ that same shit Jesus used to wear (Egyptian cloth)
Young nigga talkin’ that fly shit

[Hook: French Montana]
Could’ve been a pilot, could’ve been a doctor
Could’ve been a pimp, could’ve been a mobster
Could’ve been a mack, could’ve been a dope boy
Homie, matter of fact - I'm a motherfucking coke boy
Keep wiggling baby, I'm a motherfucking coke boy
Keep wiggling baby, I'm a motherfucking coke boy
Keep wiggling baby, I'm a motherfucking coke boy
Keep wiggling baby, I'm a motherfucking coke boy

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Could’ve been a ball player, but I’m still ballin’
’97, Coogi sweater, tryin’ to flip a quarter
Jesus piece swingin’, causin’ havoc on the corner
Got me livin’ lavish, mansions, Minnesota
Could’ve been a bus driver, swingin’ upper-cuts
Could’ve been a battle rapper, havin’ lunch with Lux
But I been a boss, tell by the tux’
I could’ve gave it thought but I don’t give a fuck
As I look around I see a bunch of dirty niggas
A lot of clean money, I just bought me 30 bitches
Coke boy, baby – dope boy, baby
Snow white Benz, don’t you want some blow, baby?
Could’ve been a fuck boy, could’ve played games
But I’m in the truck countin’ 600K
I could’ve been a hater, I could’ve been you
You could’ve been me, getting’ brain in the Coup

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
You could’ve been aborted, I could’ve been your pappy
Could’ve been a gunslinger runnin’ trigger-happy
Could’ve put an extra .2 up in the baggie
And had them niggas from the other side feelin’ aggy
Dippin’ and I’m rollin’, rollin’ and I’m dippin’
Models they be on me, tuggin’ on my zipper
Like the letter L I done crept up on an M
Broke the rearview, and never looked back since
Coke Boys flooded New York blocks way before Sandy
Fully-loaded Benz stash, fully-loaded jammy
Leanin’ toward Obama but I could’ve went for Romney
Flyest new nigga, JFK is where you’ll find me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Diddy]
I could’ve shot your brother, could’ve pimped your mother
Could’ve been a broke nigga, could’ve been a sucker (never)
Could’ve robbed dice games and shot up the Rucker
Could’ve had ‘em like “he a bad motherfucker!”
We ain’t talkin’ ‘bout what could’ve been, we talkin’ ‘bout what is
We talkin’ ‘bout helicopters landin’ on cribs
We talkin’ ‘bout niggas never doin’ what I did
Is we talkin’ ‘bout kings or is we talkin’ ‘bout kids?
What they talkin’ ‘bout?
Parties at the Rooftop, now we on that rooftop
Layin’ with your main bitch, swimmin’ in that blue dot
I’ve been clockin’ since niggas been pullin’ Jettas out
Bad Boy, but I could’ve been a, could’ve been a…

[Hook]

[Outro]
Go ahead, baby
Go ahead, baby
Go ahead, baby
