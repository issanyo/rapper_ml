[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Well, well
What do you we have here
Still getting pussy from the gift I gave her last year
But it's a new day
She want a MacBook
So I showed her how the backseat of the 'Lac look
She talking hand bags and Gucci slippers
She served me like a waiter and all I can do is tip her
Shit talking bout she need gas money
You better hop up on that pole and shake that ass for me
Ho stop acting all bougie
Knowin you'll give it up fo churches chicken and a movie
Big bucks I got em
It's amazing what they'll do for a pair of them red bottoms, ahhhh!

[Hook:Ludacris]
Yeeeeah
She said she need some rent money
I told her hop up on this dick for me
She said she need to pay her car note
Uhhhh well I need some daddy long stroke
She asked me bout her phone bill
I asked her to show me how that throat feel
She said she need to pay tuition
Well drop down to the floor and assume the fucken position ugh!

[Hook:4x]
Do sumthing strange
For a lil piece change

[Verse 2:Ludacris]
I told her, ooh ooh Jerome is in the house bitch
Fuck the bed we bout to stay right in this couch bitch
I told her if she hit it right
Id buy that iPhone with 32 gigabytes
But now you say you want an iPad
Well get nekkid and bring yo ass over to my pad
Need some help moving out your old place
I need some help showing you my 'oh face'
Now you need a back stage pass dog
Well I need some back stage ass ho
You ain't wid it?
Well keep your stingy tail then
But a little head will get yo hair and yo nails did

[Hook: Ludacris]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
She super sexy so I treat her to my wing stop
I'm trynna wet my dick and shoot off like a slingshot
We run the game so my whole fucking team hot
My top down in that same whip you dream bout
I keep a pocket full of Franks, time to work my magic
My section similar to a bank, better check the balance
Spray the Chevrolet red, likes it's from Cincinnati
Baby be giving me head, with superior talent
I pay for that pussy like its a rent-a-car
I ring the phone like 'baby oye ven aca'(baby come here)
Take her to a spot she never been a lot
Them niggas lossers, me and Luda in the winnin' slot

[Hook: Ludacris]
