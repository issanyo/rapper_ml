[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Two bands for the red bottoms
Go where rollie live they get that good good got em, yeah
Ain't no comparison
Ricky air is in the condo in the mandarin
First, know I'm putting in the work
Then I lay back cause I wanna see, wanna see a
That's when I holla church
Black bottle boss, tell her put it in reverse

[Verse 2: Sebastian Mikael]
Baby
Standing over there resting your high heels
If gorgeousness was money
Your face would be on that bill
Call me dumb or cray
Long as you call me out someday
You got me thinking like you're thinking
Make me lose my cool

[Bridge: Sebastian Mikael]
I don't care then
To I don't care who
Cause you gon make me do what I usually don't do
Make me pump my breaks
Do whatever it takes
You my main
That's everything
Girl you poppin'
I won't stop for you

[Hook: Sebastian Mikael]
I don't say this often but f*** it I'll leave all my girls just for you
Cupid got me, shot me
But once you got me I'll be only for you
I don't say this often but f*** it I'll leave all my girls just for you
I put that on my mother
I wanna love you
I'll leave all them for you

[Verse 3: Sebastian Mikael]
Baby when you get dressed
I can see your L.A. business
While we in Miami
I beat it so good
Want your body to win a Grammy girl
But those girls can't do what you do
On top it's what you choose to
You got me thinking like you're thinking
Make me lose my cool

[Bridge: Sebastian Mikael]

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
The boss is back
Make you a rich girl
Hold on to me just to ride .... girl
Big cars
Drunk money and cigars
My all white walls
All just a montage
Can I paint a picture?
Do that, do that really miss ya
Make love til you cry oh my here's a tissue
Now ride with a thug, pistol on tuck
Ridin' in the Wraith, LV on the rug
Carol City G, well-known overseas
Tell me what you wanna see
And I could sit it on the seat
Spend it on a car
Now I spend it on your feet
Ear master bumpin all in my Jeep
You can hear it in the Jeep and you can see it in my eyes
And it's a hundred million street
I'm the boss

[Hook x2: Sebastian Mikael]
