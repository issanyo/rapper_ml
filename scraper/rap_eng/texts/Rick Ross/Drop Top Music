[Intro: Boosie Badazz]
Big Wayne on this beat nigga, drop top music, gas the whip up
Call my bad bitch, uh huh, way better than my last bitch

[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz]
Drop top, wife beater and the weed lit
Woke up this morning, hit three chicks
Show money today, it's so sunny
Check the whip off playa, I'm getting money
[?] on my face, yeah this a couple grand
Hunnid grand plus in my jewel house pants
Everywhere I ride, getting love from the fans
Bond no. 9, you can see it when I pass
Going to the hotspot cause I love that you're my eight
Rolex watch, four bricks and a half
Haters looking down, I just look at them and laugh
Champagne, bubble bath, shopping spree for my gal

[Hook: Boosie Badazz & Rick Ross]
This is drop drop drop drop drop top music
This is drop drop drop drop drop top music
(this that shit that we ride to)
Top down riding with my duffle bag
Shoutout to my [?]
Drop down where them fucking hustlers at
[?] where that weed rolled

[Verse 2]
Today i'm in that [?] Cuban chains on my neck
Look to the right bad bitch on deck
Hottest nigga in the game and i'm feeling like that
Big bank roll ooh kill em like that
I might go in the mall and spend 5
All black King's hat Air Max 95
Go take a ride to that other side
Call my nigga in that 63 Chevy
Tell that boy bring Ebony and Stephanie
I'm a put em in the backseat

Now we four deep
Loud in the air living life without a care
To the hood where it's good
Where we creeping like a snail (real slow)

Looking up thanking god
That i'm the realest nigga out
Hand on the wheel
And the pinky ring talk
And the pinky ring talk, i'm a boss

[Hook: Boosie Badazz & Rick Ross]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Drop top double R
My name ring in the city
That phone still jumping
They know i got em for 20
Bad boy with the bricks
My boy Meek out in Philly
I got a house on the beach
Don't make me peel back the ceiling
Top down everyday
To show these niggas my watch
On the phone at the lot
My Benzie holding my Glock
Got a stick in the trunk
That bitch right next to the amp
If i got beef with a nigga
Then I got beef with his camp
[?] i'm ready
They red bottom you dig
26 inch wheels and went and got em a [?]
Check in the luggage
And carry on all the money
Take his bitch in the club
You know that bitch looking for me
Bitches flagging me down
They got me tapping my breaks
Shorty pretty in the ass
[?]
They wanna ride in the drop
She wanna fuck with a boss
She wanna fuck with some [?]
My nigga let down the drop
(i'm out)

[Hook: Boosie Badazz & Rick Ross]
Drop drop drop drop drop top music
Drop top music
This is drop drop drop drop drop top music

Drop down where them fucking hustlers at
