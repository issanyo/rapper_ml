[Intro: blackbear]
Yeah
â€‹beartrap trap music

[Chorus: blackbear]
I'd rather be dying than be going broke
I would rather die before I lose this though
Swear to God
How you finna shine with all that shade you throw, grow up
How you finna shine with all that shade you throw, grow up
You ain't shine if you don't learn to glo, glo up
You ain't shine if you don't learn to glo, glo up
You ain't shine if you don't learn to glo, get your dough up
You ain't shine if you don't learn to glo, glo up

[Verse 1: blackbear]
How you finna smoke with us if you don't roll, roll up
How you finna rock with us if you don't show, no love
Told you meet me here, same place, same time, same corner
Gotta do this whole bad before we hit the border, yeah
Came from red Corolla
Candy apple Faygo make that kinda purple-red soda
Yeah, that's how I roll up, that's how I pour up
White ghost, ten toes, inside Gucci loafer
White ghost, ten toes, inside Gucci loafer
White ghost, ten toes, inside Gucci loafer
That's how I roll up, that's how I pour up
White ghost, ten toes, inside Gucci loafer

[Chorus: blackbear]
I'd rather be dying than be going broke
I would rather die before I lose this though
Swear to God
How you finna shine with all that shade you throw, grow up
How you finna shine with all that shade you throw, grow up
You ain't shine if you don't learn to glo, glo up
You ain't shine if you don't learn to glo, glo up
You ain't shine if you don't learn to glo, get your dough up
You ain't shine if you don't learn to glo, glo up

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Real niggas deserve to live twice
Plastic fork and fried rice
He's gonna get his money baby
Photograph of my whips, autograph of your bitch
Cuban links for my gang, tech nines for my clique
Full auto boy right here, livin' like I went pro
Quarter mill' on my trips, bitches names in my notes
Know I keeps it so real, niggas don't want that smoke
Babies can't think so clear, I'm in diaries that she wrote
Back seats in this bitch, rest in peace if you snitch
Niggas killin' for chips, and it won't be a glitch

[Chorus: blackbear]
I'd rather be dying than be going broke
I would rather die before I lose this though
Swear to God
How you finish shining with all that shade you throw, grow up
How you finish shining with all that shade you throw, grow up
You ain't shine if you don't learn to glo, glo up
You ain't shine if you don't learn to glo, glo up
You ain't shine if you don't learn to glo, get your dough up
You ain't shine if you don't learn to glo, glo up
