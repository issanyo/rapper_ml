Were in my mind all could I thinking about us
From last year
And She been fool around these Fellas in the
Streets, Then I was watching her at the park with Yo’ her
Friends

Chorus:
In my mind I tired of you risking the Friendship
Between us like old crush
Push, She trying keep me out of her life
And she hide things from me
Be, I like honest with you Girl and but she try apologize
To me



Verse1:
Were I won’t be hurt by you girl and She run after me
Been you by yourself in that house brought by some dude
That she falling in love with
Fifth, day of her interview with her boss and
Got a weird text message from her man

Verse2:
Then I can’t believe you anymore and
Looking in her face by the expression
While she walking by me laughing about the
Our Memories
Forgive, I won’t trust you girl no more
And she spend up my money on new brand phone
Without asking me

Chorus:
In my mind I tired of you risking the Friendship
Between us like old crush
Push, She trying keep me out of her life
And she hide things from me
Be, I like honest with you Girl and but she try apologize
To me

Verse3:
When She riding around with her man though
Out Atlanta City
And I been performing at live concert surround by
Beautiful Ladies
Shady, I could’ve seen a shadowy figure of her
Beauty from a far way
