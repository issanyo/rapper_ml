[Chorus]
[Yo Gotti]
Doors up, doors down
When I’m in the club, bitch, it's going down
Shorty thick as fuck, hands down
Hands up, pants down
Down, down, shorty fucking head down
I see my phone blowing up, I know it’s going down
Once I busted at the rapper, then it hit the town
Chiefin' numbers in the city, boy, it going down

[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
Niggas stand up, chicks stand down
Cuz its bad bitches on deck when I'm around
You see this nigga rich as fuck, hands down
He throw bands up and bands come down
(yeah)This dude be spending cash down
I heard that he be tricking, but the nigga ain't a clown
He usually do the redbone, tonight he want a brown
He said the pussy so live these other bitches dead now
Cuz when we laid up I lay it down
When he in the pussy nigga swear he bout to drown
Yeah, it be wet as fuck ,hands down
With the legs up or with the legs down
Tell them niggas!

[Chorus]
[Yo Gotti]
Doors up, doors down
When I’m in the club, bitch, it's going down
Shorty thick as fuck, hands down
Hands up, pants down
Down, down, shorty fucking head down
I see my phone blowing up, I know it’s going down
Once I busted at the rapper, then it hit the town
Chiefin' numbers in the city, boy, it going down


[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Post lil homie bond, now watch him do the Shmurda dance
The cut a nigga yard that shit went down to 30-grand
Fuck with Shaka Zulu in dem in Zimbabwe
Fat boy, got 40 foreign's in the driveway
A hundred bands in the back a make her recognize
I never ask her name until we fuck a second time
Standing still diamonds dancing in the summertime
We all got ? coming down
She be in my double R and I'm just runnin round
That body boy punching bag and boy I run the South
Bullet wounds all in his back or we gone gun you down
Buying all the highest rises while the numbers down

[Chorus]
[Yo Gotti]
Doors up, doors down
When I’m in the club, bitch, it's going down
Shorty thick as fuck, hands down
Hands up, pants down
Down, down, shorty fucking head down
I see my phone blowing up, I know it’s going down
Once I busted at the rapper, then it hit the town
Chiefin' numbers in the city, boy, it going down
