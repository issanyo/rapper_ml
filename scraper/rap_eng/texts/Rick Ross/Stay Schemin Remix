I ride for my niggas dawg
And I ride for my niggas, yeah
See I ride for my niggas dawg
And I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin'
You know im gon' ride til the end
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin'
You know I'm gon' ride til the end
I ride for my niggas, yeah

Alright, my brothers know I'm ridin' to the end, notice the word brother, man I did't use friend
Real niggas stand strong, real niggas dont bend, world full of pain, like when it gon' end
Got strength like my father, got brains like my mother, I put on for my brothas, but when it comes to hatin', man I don't even bother

Cuz that is not important, it pays to be the boss, but I bet ya'll can't afford it. My cuzzo tried to put his fam on and got deported

Life is too crazy, but precious like new babies, listen to what I'm sayin', reppin it to the end, hated because I'm Haitian, but I ain't never changin', Lookin' up to the Lord, lookin down on Satan

Oops I think we made it, bring pleasure like masturbation, rappin' like I'm the greatest, no wonder you can't relate it, different blood, but yeah, we ride like we related, can't....find the truth, but in your mind you chase it, you got a problem well you might as well face
It

White man, lock you down, give you new bracelets, ain't nothing changed man, reminds me of slavery, where I grew up, I am what it made me, boss ass nigga doin boss ass thangs
Obama repped change, but change takes time, and time don't wait. My niggas all hungry and my niggas dont eat, fake niggas, they avoid me when they see me in the street, and my nigga M on that beat

You swear you a dog, but my niggas goin' beast. Cal, rest in peace, Jayshaun, rest in peace, cookin up the flow, K Balla be the recipe, wake up in the mornin', say I'm God's masterpeice, before I take a leak, and I go and brush my teeth

Snapbacks and Retros, yeah I'm super clean, I'm so 509, 501's on my jeans. My pockets favorite color gotta be green, I don't tweet, but all the girls follow me, if the sun had a baby, it ain't hot as me,( I repeat if the sun had a baby it ain't hot as me)

Honestly, I dont see nobody. mugshot, I dont see nobody, dont assume, ask questions, they know bout me, I keep it real, dont try nobody, ask my brothas for yourself, they can cosign it

I was raised from the dirt, now I spit diamonds, add a comma, duckin' all the drama, I gotta succeed, a friendly reminder, and my brothas hustle hard, we some fulltime grindas, If we find out you a snitch, there'll be no reminders
