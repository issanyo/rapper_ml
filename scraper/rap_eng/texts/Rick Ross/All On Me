(Intro: Rick Ross)
This might be the fly s*** of the year right here
Get your money up baby, champagne for everyone
It's the biggest
(KSR)

(Verse 1: Josh X)
(ok, ok)
Pillow tight, late night, wait by ya phone
(Yeah this fly s*** right here, I don't give a f***)
Before you wake up I'll be home by the morning
You know a n**** work hard, so I'm always in my zone
I been a dog since day one, so I'm quick to catch a bone

(Pre-chorus: Josh X)
I know ya looking for love
Girl you gotta trust me, I'm the one with the ones
You should come and get you some I got plenty more
You know I built this for us
Girl you gotta trust me, I'm all that you need. (uh)

(Chorus: Josh X)
Lets look up to the stars girl, we could really go far
We gonna work hard today, so we can chill tomorrow
Put it all on me, all on me, all on me yeah. (x2)

(Verse 2: Rick Ross)
(In a world of so many, I am the one
Worlds greatest, you feel me?)
Fireplace lit we sippin' cognac
Loyal to each other, f*** a contract
Trips to Phipps, she get the newest bags
Fashion Week in New York, she keep the coolest rags
Solemnly swear, I spoil her like Rihanna
Plaques on the wall, she living like Madonna
Condo on the beach, private tennis courts
Clique of rich n****'s, really but I spend the most
Dirty money but I keep a fresh roses
Sofas in the SLS in the best loafers
Gotta stay strapped its a lotta hate
And always keep a trap wit a lotta base
I always hold her hands when she begin to cry
I swear its heaven doors looking in her eyes
Pretty boys but we keep it militant
I'm 50 million on and I'm spending it

(Chorus: Josh X)
Lets look up to the stars girl, we could really go far
We gonna work hard today, so we can chill tomorrow
Put it all on me, all on me, all on me yeah. (x2)
(Legendary)

(Verse 3: Josh X)
(ok, ok)
Look how ya man just bought this home, CASH
I done took you from the bottom to the top, now you on
(We the biggest)
We up and leave when it's cold. (Penthouse)
Yeah we f***in' made it, I thought I told you, you was f***ing with the greatest

(Pre-chorus: Josh X)
I know ya looking for love
Girl you gotta trust me, I'm the one with the ones
You should come and get you some I got plenty more
You know I built this for us
Girl you gotta trust me, I'm all that you need. (uh)

(Chorus: Josh X) (x2)
Lets look up to the stars girl, we could really go far
We gonna work hard today, so we can chill tomorrow
Put it all on me, all on me, all on me yeah. (x2)
