[Intro]
Hey it's your girl Super Cindy reporting live from the corner of 183rd Street and 27th Avenue at Checkers, in Miami Gardens. We got Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz, and Rick Ross. And we're here for the buy back the block movement. Where we raise up the community and support and love us

[Intro: Rick Ross]
We own the hood
And we live by it, die by it then ya heard me

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I got crib in Florida, and I don't even stay there
Been bought my mama a crib, bought baby mama a daycare
I gotta ball for Peter, all of my boys illegal
I used to sell the reefer, now I just sell Adidas
Been had the Rollie, been ate bologna
Just closed on a Cali crib, round the corner from Kobe
Property, property, property, property, nigga I'm tryna invest
Talking monopoly, I'm tryna encourage a nigga to run up a check
Nigga no treadmill, you niggas just stand still
Heard you were talkin' trash, throw that shit in the landfill
I'm 'bout the money, lil nigga
Ben Franklin my uncle, lil nigga
I used to trap right in front of you nigga
Sellin' dope just like dunkin' to niggas uh
This is a windmill, I smell like 10 mil
Put all my chains on, I cause a wind chill
I hit up Renzel, went over details
Got us some young niggas that'll stand on your windshield

[Hook: Rick Ross]
It's time to buy back the block, buy back the block
It's time to buy back the block, buy back the block
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
I'm 'bout to buy back the hood, buy back the hood

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I sold 10 bricks a day but now I need 10 Chick-Fil-A's
Just bought 2 studios 'cause I got so much shit to say
I made 10 million dollars, man and I was on house arrest
She says her jaws hurt, she need to give her mouth a rest
These niggas fallin' off, only the strong survive
These suckers reachin' out, but ain't no need to try
T-Tell 'em somethin' slick, slick enough to Slip-N-Slide
And I know how to pitch, so I'ma get your bitch to drive
All the OG's I looked up to?, man they broke as shit
These lil niggas look up to me because I'm super rich
I'm goin' live, I-I'm still alive
God thank you for my punishment, it made me wise

[Hook: Rick Ross]
It's time to buy back the block, buy back the block
It's time to buy back the block, buy back the block
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
I'm 'bout to buy back the hood, buy back the hood

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
It's time to clean up the ghetto, a dope boy wanna shine
Time to buy back the block, talkin' one brick at a time
I sold a few records, I bought me a Checkers
Wingstop well invested, so Taco Bell left for breakfast
I seen a few M's, it's time to touch me that 100
So let's put up this money and let's go half on the Sonics
Yes I feed lemon pepper, angel wings with the feathers
If you feel like I feel, I pray you live Rich Forever
Okay, let's buy back the block, I might buy me a Wendy's
Just to pull up on skinnies every Tuesday and Wednesdays
I might buy me 10 Denny's, I might buy Family Dollar
Cut it to 50 Cent, I got a job for your father
I'm tryna help with the rent, I came up from the strength
My lil son? he a prince, it's time that we represent

[Hook: Rick Ross]
It's time to buy back the block, buy back the block
It's time to buy back the block, buy back the block
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
I'm 'bout to buy back the hood, buy back the hood

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
It's all about your last name meaning something, you heard me? Start with you a duplex, work up to a house, maybe a small plaza, I'm looking for a mall. Anybody selling a mall holler at me, you heard me? Maybe get my mama a gas station, she like BP. Texaco holler at me, you heard me? It's the boss

[Outro: Rick Ross]
I'm 'bout to buy back the block, buy back the block
It's time to buy back the block, buy back the block
I'm 'bout to buy back the city, buy back the city
Buy back the city, buy back the city
