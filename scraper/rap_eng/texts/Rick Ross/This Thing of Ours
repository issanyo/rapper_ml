[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Sometimes I get so fucking paranoid
Reminiscing on how them bricks keep going back and forth
I ask the Lord for everything I lack and more
Last thing on my mind was slamming Caddy doors
I just made up my mind, I'm grinding like a boss
Dedicated our lives, sacrifices we lost
Fatal mistakes, talking laws of attraction
The paper I'm making, I upgraded my fashion
Everything tailor-made, flossing's my passion
Loyalty came first, number one rule in the faction
Follow my actions, came in in '06
Planted my flag, bitch I'm taking no shit
I toted them toolies, I bullied the bullies
I made a few hits, my bank account Jewish
Niggas is minor, the money manure
I'm thinking like Hyman, Godfather the 4th
It was never filmed, therefore never seen
It was never him, that's what these haters scream
I wrote the script, I was sipping lean
Now meet the myth, I brought along my triple beam

[Hook: Omarion]
This thing of ours, ohh ohhh
It's so mafioso (yeah)
You ain't never know though (no) never gon' know so (no)
No never, no never, no never, no, no, no, no

[Verse 2: Wale]
This reefer the sweetest, got me thinking much deeper
They don’t rap for a reason, this is rather convenient
Spend money with my team, make my money from hustle
Women love you for fee, niggas hate you for nothing
Never hate you in public, better let they eyes tell it
Ain't even 5’11″, what the fuck you guys scared of?
I’m a loose cannon, screws damaged
And I do think hip hop music needs some newer standards
Hardest working conglomerate, and that's word to my mama
Getting up in they mental, get ‘em outta their garments
Adamantly coming at whoever call up for drama
Just know that DC, Philly, Ohio, Miami got us
Private jet over water, natty dread, got no barber
I see Feds, I go that way, that DMV shit taught us
When you young and you black, they see you as a target
So before them Foamposites, get ya lawyers in order
Ralph

[Hook: Omarion]
This thing of ours, ohh ohhh
It's so mafioso (yeah)
You ain't never know though (no) never gon' know so (no)
No never, no never, no never, no, no, no, no

[Verse 3: Nas]
The don of all dons, since y'all wanna call me something
All a sudden, niggas ball and stunting, y'all just started pulling on Havanas
Pull ya card, ya spineless, where ya heart, I know where mine is
A don is one who accept things he cannot change
Only thing I accept I cannot change is getting old and dying
Gold medallion over my son chest, he’ll hold it down when I sunset
What does death mean to me? I never owned the concept, I was here
I’m just a spirit, let's get one thing clear
Everything segues into each other
One thing is just an extension of the other
My kid to me, I am my children through history
Upstanding men and stand up women, I am existing
I was conceived to break bread with kings and make connections
We haven’t met yet, my reputation you’ve stuck with
Until we have our formal introduction, that’s enough
But every male is not a man
So some of those that will hold out they hand won't understand
This thing of ours

[Hook: Omarion]
This thing of ours, ohh ohhh
It's so mafioso (yeah)
You ain't never know though (no) never gon' know so (no)
No never, no never, no never, no, no, no, no
