Carol City Cartel

[Hook: Rick Ross & Dre]
Designer jeans and a hand full of dough (Yeah)
Bottle of that Rose, pass me some mo'
I got, mo' cars, mo' cars, mo' clothes, mo' clothes
Mo' money means more dough to blow (Bloooowwww)
Mo' bottles, there's more dough to blow (Bloooowwww)
Rick Ross got a lot of dough to blow

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Way up in them Cali Hills, burnin' like the sunset
A nigga wit' a attitude, take it outta' context
Ridin' with that big thang, lookin' like a bomb threat
Bin Laden beard, Afghan in a bomb vest
Ross, stranded on death row
Makavali's on the Maybach, kicks retro
She wanna gaze at the stars
Pull a panoramic view, Pull the haze out the jar
Rick Ross, I'm the best in the flesh
Gettin' blessed on a jet is a way to reflect
Hard work pays off, I'm a boss, you can tell
By the bottles in the pail, and the models that we share
I'm into real estate, in a realer state of mind
We came for trigga' play, kill a nigga for a dime
I'm tryna' chill today, I got a million on my mind
Dice in my hand, one roll, I blow ya mind

[Hook: Rick Ross & Dre]
Designer jeans and a hand full of dough (Yeah)
Bottle of that Rose, pass me some mo'
[I got, mo' cars, mo' cars, mo' clothes, mo' clothes
Mo' money means more dough to blow (Bloooowwww)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Mo' trips, mo' whips, mo' money, I'm mo' rich
Mo' haters, mo' clips, mo' jewels, mo' shit
Half a hundred grand in some rubber bands
Gats all flashed in my other hand
On the other hand, I'm still pitchin' underhand
All softballs, all bases covered man
Mo' trucks, mo' bucks, mo' freaks, mo' butts
I see the vision, from Club Vision to Priv√©
I get brain, I bust nuts, in each states
Soon as I see what I'm lookin' for
I sit up in that seat and cut em' off on them 24's
There it goes, baby girl come talk wit' tha' boss
I pop a rose bottles, you can kick ya shoes off

[Hook: Rick Ross & Dre]
Designer jeans and a hand full of dough (Yeah)
Bottle of that Rose, pass me some mo'

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Ever seen a fat boy in a big body
Know you wanna see about me, all you do is think bout it
Lease apartments to get kicked out it
Next day, buy a condo to get a kick out it
Mill ticket for the view, this is what I do
When I'm on the beach, all my diamonds salt water blue
So let's party like the pack jam, Pac-Man
Fifty grand, stacked in my lap man
Get a lap dance, and if you get my dick hard
This ya last chance, to up up on that big car
Wit' tha Fat Man, certified Hood Star
But he a millionaire, look bitch you goin' far
This the movement, a few niggas' you wanna move wit'
Gucci on my feet, see I'm only in the new shit
Ha, they say life's a bitch
But close ya eyes for a minute, and just bite this dick, it's Ross
