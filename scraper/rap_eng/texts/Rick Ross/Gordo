[Intro: Rick Ross]
Biggest in the Game
Biggest at the dinner
Rozay and Carnage
Fat boys in the building
Fat boys at the Back

[Verse: Rick Ross]
Bounce in the buckles
Belly's a bubble
But the way I'ma fuck you
She gon' tell me I love you
These niggas keep testing
Just a new hole in the desert
I'm texting my reverend
Please recite Psalms twenty-seven
If you seen how I'm living
You would think I was a villain
Got my niggas deported guilty for making a killing
Keep your hands off the cage boy
I'm the one to put you on the front page boy
Don't see none of these niggas
Rozay's repertoire
Professions of a hustler
I pray I see tomorrow
Duffle bags heavy got me on this Ross fit
Never catch me slipping cause I keep my marksmen
