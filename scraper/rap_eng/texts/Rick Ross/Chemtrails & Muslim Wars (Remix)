[Intro: Isa Muhammad]
I come from a time where it is about like bars nigga, where it's about like lyrics nigga, where it's about like saying some shit nigga, some deep shit nigga, some shit about black people my nigga. You shit about, you know, some some some esoteric spiritual type shit, some shit that goes into the essence of what it just means to just be black and just popping in America, you feel me? Like. Isa Muhammad nigga

[Verse 1: Isa Muhammad]
Incarceration, genocide, they kill you if you criticize
They got your name and number nigga, intelligence centralized
The homie Paper just got shot, I pray he make it through the night
I know some niggas did some time, had to fly a couple kites
I roll around my fucking city feeling like I'm Michael Knight
And Jesus Christ, you neophytes, I'm Norris Cole up in the snow
I always get the shot to go, I got the baddest bitch for sho'
Bout to come out 10 or fo', and he come from coldest coast
Lyrics caught the Holy Ghost and travel 'round on golden spokes
Naenae done hit them folkes, it's the end of time if you did not know
Palestine and the occupation, the aids deadly but you can't taste it
I'm in the booth on vacation, I feel like Wayne, it's a dedication
Outer space on the reservation, Apartheid  it's an assassination
The shit I spit come from dark spaces like dark matter meets Darth Vader and elevated then meditated till he levitated
Dronestrikes at your frontdoor, Inglewood forever more
Chemtrails and Muslim wars

[Chorus: Isa Muhammad]
And I ain't trippin 'bout no bitches
Nah, said I'd rather put the city on, nigga
It's Inglewood forever, look
Like chemtrails and Muslim wars
And I ain't trippin 'bout no bitches bro
Nah, uhuh, said I'd rather put the city on
Word, it's Inglewood forevermore
Uh, like chemtrails and Muslim wars

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm the Charles Dickens for these young niggas
Pray these scriptures pay my daughter tuition, it's my vision
Ask me what I wanna be, and I said I'm a poet
Survive a drive-by got me feeling heroic
AK47's for the shock and awe
Made a fortune, and no more smoking in those parking lots
Your men see you through a different lens
Ain't no love cause they killing even wives and friends
Scholarships to school, they wanna know my race
Took a trip to Egypt, then I chose my faith
Field niggas would never suffer from sunburns
One word, you still a nigga, take this whole verse
Innercity niggas living by the Gotti rules
To be on house arrest he made a lotta moves
I'm prepaid for my next rhymes
I'll let these niggas shine maybe next time

[Chorus: Isa Muhammad]
Your men see you through a different lens
Ain't no love cause they killing even wives and friends
Scholarships to school, they wanna know my race
Took a trip to Egypt, then I chose my faith
Field niggas would never suffer from sunburn
One word, you still a nigga, take this whole verse
Innercity niggas living by the Gotti rules
To be on house arrest, he made a lot of moves
I'm prepaid for my next rhymes
I'll let these niggas shine maybe next time

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
You received my gift, like a present, so my presence is a charity
The difference is it's clear, but I focus on similarities
We in the trenches for our lives, these my soldiers in solidarity
Your intelligence artificial, that's why you're filled with singularity
Got that advice from my pops, it's a staple
Like a plate of rice never, not religion, but a way of life
Pick your battle, save your fights
A wise man can play the fool, behave or pay the price
Respectability is cool, but that don't keep me safe at night
This is why I'm still evolve 'cause these policies'll kill us all
Nah they can't kill us all, that's why they wanna build a wall
But they don't steal and they don't rape and still get all
Like they don't deal in raw, like they don't kill at all
I'm a New Yorker, I saw the builings fall, they came because we built it first
The bricks are falling I say, and [?], that's like the illest verse
So for me to trust, you gotta get the fuck up out your feelings first
Now watch you go from "Feel the Bern" to "Build it with the Bildergbergs"
What the fuck is feelings worth

[Chorus: Isa Muhammad]
And I ain't trippin 'bout no bitches
Nah, said I'd rather put the city on, nigga
It's Inglewood forever, look
Like chemtrails and Muslim wars
And I ain't trippin 'bout no bitches bro
Nah, uhuh, said I'd rather put the city on
Word, it's Inglewood forevermore
Uh, like chemtrails and Muslim wars
