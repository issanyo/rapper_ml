[Intro: Rick Ross]
(Hoe overboard!)
It's only one Christopher Colombus
A.k.a The Big Fish
Uhh

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship
Got me on the lookout for the baddest bitch
Hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship
I just listen for the splash
They just looking for the cash

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
All blue Ferrari, bitches think it's crip
I tip the valet then it's straight to V.I.P
We rocking side to side, just like we in a boat
We moving units and we selling coke
I walk the city like I run the coast
Shorty started swimming when she seen the boat
They jumping ship, shawty jumping ship
We the shit, niggas getting rich
She got a pretty smile and got an ass
Diddy shot, I got CÃ®roc all in my glass
You deserve a nigga with a yacht
Fat nigga with a lot, yah

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Hoes jumping ship, hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship, hoes jumping ship
Got me on the lookout for the baddest bitch
Hoes jumping ship, hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship, hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship, hoes jumping ship
I just listen for the splash
They just looking for the cash

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
She got her hair down to her ass
King of diamonds, got her throwing cash
It should be a crime, she a dime
Sending pussy pics, that's all the time
Come to the boss and get your raise
All the hoes hating from a fake page
You the shit, shawty, you the shit
Plead the fifth, they gone plead the fifth
I got your ex liking my pics
Even wrote a comment, life's a bitch
Life vest, he need a life vest
Yacht club with the pyrex

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Hoes jumping ship, hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship, hoes jumping ship
Got me on the lookout for the baddest bitch
Hoes jumping ship, hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship, hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship, hoes jumping ship
I just listen for the splash
They just looking for the cash

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Big booty bitches live on the Gram
Big money baller, so they know just who I am
A Lonzo Ball [?]
All the cheerleaders I fuck 'em all
I'm confident I'm wealthy in a nigga afterlife
Rich forever, definition of a sacrifice
So, hold my hand and we can run the world
Loyalty will get you everything that you deserve
I left the Lamborghini in Miami
I took the Wraith with me to Cincinatti
I gotta driver who keep all the sticks
For pussy niggas who be jumping ship

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Hoes jumping ship, hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship, hoes jumping ship
Got me on the lookout for the baddest bitch
Hoes jumping ship, hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship, hoes jumping ship
Hoes jumping ship, hoes jumping ship
I just listen for the splash
They just looking for the cash
