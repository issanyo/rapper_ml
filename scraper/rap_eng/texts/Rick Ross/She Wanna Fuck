[Intro: August Alsina]
Give it here
Don't say nothin', just give it here
Don't hold back, just give it here
Don't say nothin', just give it here
Don't hold back, yeah, give it here
Don't say nothin', just give it here
Don't hold back, just give it here
Don't say nothin', just give it here

[Hook: August Alsina]
She looks so good and she acts so bad
She like to have fun and I'm with all that
We can get down cause I know what's up
She don't wanna fall in love, she just wanna fuck
She just wanna fuck, she just wanna fuck
She just wanna fuck, she just wanna fuck

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Locked myself in a room and it's time to elevate
Let me play with your mind and I know another way
I'm talkin' paper and stacks, givin' shorty the facts
Fire in your eyes, minks on your back
I had a couple thoughts that we could walk through
Maybe swim a couple laps, I got your swimming suit
Maybe kiss a couple spots, I know it tempts you
You should bring your best friend, that's what you're into
Bring me breakfast in bed and I'll handle the brunch
Bel Air bottles like a boss, penthouse at the Trump
Rollin' dice into stacks, bet I hit the triple
I really never been in love as I reminisce

[Hook: August Alsina]
She looks so good and she acts so bad
She like to have fun and I'm with all that
We can get down cause I know what's up
She don't wanna fall in love, she just wanna fuck
She just wanna fuck, she just wanna fuck
She just wanna fuck, she just wanna fuck

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I see your stock rise, only counter clockwise
You in reverse, outer verse from the far side
Blowin' trees out the window loopin' J Dilla
I been all around the world, came back the same nigga
Pink surface, that's the purpose of a side chick
My number one's still number one, the one I side with
She's the same one I referenced in the first verse
Red carpet VMA's, pull out your best work
Top 5 dead, alive, looked at Eazy
Sex with Foxy Brown, sessions with young Yeezy
Yeezus, shakes, I mean seizures
You're so fine, God, I need Jesus

[Hook: August Alsina]
She looks so good and she acts so bad
She like to have fun and I'm with all that
We can get down cause I know what's up
She don't wanna fall in love, she just wanna fuck
She just wanna fuck, she just wanna fuck
She just wanna fuck, she just wanna fuck

[Bridge: August Alsina]
After the club, she wanna keep it going
She don't wanna stop, so I keep her cummin'
She so fine, she make you wanna lock her down
But she wanna be free enough to spread that love around

[Hook: August Alsina]
She looks so good and she acts so bad
She like to have fun and I'm with all that
We can get down cause I know what's up
She don't wanna fall in love, she just wanna fuck
She just wanna fuck, she just wanna fuck
She just wanna fuck, she just wanna fuck
