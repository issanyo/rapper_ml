[Hook]
I'm round and round and I'm gettin it
It's mine, I spend it..

[Verse 1 - Rick Ross]
White girl, that Ricky Lake
That boy can't feel his face
Rozay and I'm blowed up
Sho nuff, no cut
1 Glock, 2 Chainz, 3 dudes, 4 thangs
550 S-Class, inside its jet-black
You know me, I'm with that
Snitch and you kidnapped
I show up, you ho up
I get dough, boy hold up
You went broke? That shit cray
Maybach, my shit gray
Run this, you know that
One mil cash, that boy back

[Hook]

[Interlude - 2 Chainz]
I'm smoking on exotic
My girl ain't got no stomach
Every time we have sex she always ask me for a hundred
I ask her if she working
She ask me do I want it
I say when I went to school, bitch, money was the subject

[Hook]

[Verse 2- 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around my side of town
Boxing gloves: I'll beat the trial
I had the coke, I had the smile
I have a coat for every style
Crocodile, the gator type
I'm allergic to the hater type
I'll take your wife
Give her back
Nine months after that..SIMILAC!
? mama's baby daddy's maybe
When we had sex I was in a Mercedes!
And I ain't crazy
But if that's my baby
Then we gonna have to name the love baby Mercedes
The money that I'm making
I don't see it like I'm blind
I'd rather spend money baby, I don't spend time
My pockets on full and so is my gas tank
And all my cars got gas in the ashtrays ?

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - T.I.]
I'm riding around my side of town
With my dubs up and my windows down
It's the King homie, I'm on one
Them suckers know they don't want none
Instead of repping that one, son
Bankhead, Window
? are rolled and I'm going over
To pick up some dope from ?
My C white and my paint tight
Spray candy red, the same as the wheel
I got a bag of pills in my stash box
Steady whippin the rack side
I got a quarter mil in my Louis bag
If you wanna know what that sack about
Still rep for them have-nots
Try to hold me, you ass out
? cool shit, new kicks
Super sport on deuces, bumping that trap music
I'm super paid, I'm Gucci
2 cute chicks, they do tricks
They out of my business
While I'm riding around and I'm getting it!
