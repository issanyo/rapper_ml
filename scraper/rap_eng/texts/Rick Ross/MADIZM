Niggas get it and they fall off
It's cause they all soft
Nigga like me started at the car wash
8am to 10pm, that's on the rainy day
Wise words from dope boys meant everything
They say it's levels to the street life
Then I seen a bezel with the pink ice
All natural, momma tell you to be careful
In the trap trappin' to increase capital
No longer cruising with the windows down
Hand on the pistol anticipating the riddle sound
I'm Kanye when it came to 'ye
I'm Jay-Z when it came to keys
I'm Snoop when it came to weed
So now they wanna Biggie me
As the credit rolls, now the charge is federal
Money bags, I'm placed upon a pedestal
Still on the block in my Reeboks
You ain't really know these was the Basquiat's
You ain't really know who really call shots
Worldwide mastermind, number one all charts

Reporting live from the land of the hopeless
Representing for the team that won rings with no coaches
We stay strapped and we cockin' so don't approach us
Price Johnson with a big gold chain and Louis Loafers
Been hiding guns in the sofa since toy soldiers
Thunder-domes up in Hyde Park, didn't nobody know us
We took all fades, our introduction was from the shoulders
We was kids, honestly we just needed someone to hold us
Grindin' hard on them corners with cane boulders
Fascinated by the green, all we wanted was Range Rovers
On the block politicking with brain blowers
Real niggas that got love in their hearts but can't show it
We live and die for the fame and the lights glowing
Fox Hills buying Jordans, but still the pain showing
When I die, put me next to the dead poets
Tell 'em God had a plan for me and I didn't know it
Victory
