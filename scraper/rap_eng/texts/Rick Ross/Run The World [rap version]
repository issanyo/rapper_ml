[Intro]
Uh, we got it locked, but hey know
Oh, what whenever we around it goes down like Draino
Oh, and it's nothing to spend these pesos
And you will never see us low low
There is nothing greater
Hanging out the window, straight busting at you love haters

[Verse 1]
Bonnie, Clyde
No other girl will ever ride like I ride
That’s why you need me on your passenger side
Let me help you get that paper
Hanging out the window busting at them love haters
Me and you
I'm the closest you'll ever be to truth
There’s never a question of what I'll do, uh huh, for you
With me, you'll never lose, so...

[Chorus]
Call on your girl that can hold you right
I'll be your protector, I'll never forget ya
You need somebody that can hold you tight
I'll be in your arm love, keep you out of harm boy
I'll be your anything, everything
Rock 'n roll with ya
If things get to hot out in the cold with ya
Froze, froze with ya
Me and you together, our love could run the world
Run the world
Our love could run the world
Run the world
Our love could run the world

[Post-Chorus]
I’ll be your anything, everything
Rock ’n roll with ya
If things get to hot out in the cold with ya
Froze, froze with ya
Me and you together, our love could run the world
Our love could run the world

[Verse 2]
Make it through any weather, baby
Don't pay them any attention, it’ll just drive you crazy
All that really matters is our love for one another
And all we'll ever have is each other
Let a chick try to come around
We both know she'll never be down
She'll never have your back, wouldn’t know how to act
Can't say it no better than that

[Chorus]
Call on your girl that can hold you right
I'll be your protector, I'll never forget ya
You need somebody that can hold you tight
I'll be in your arm love, keep you out of harm boy
I'll be your anything, everything
Rock 'n roll with ya
If things get to hot out in the cold with ya
Froze, froze with ya
Me and you together, our love could run the world
Run the world
Our love could run the world
Run the world
Our love could run the world

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be your anything, everything
Rock 'n roll with ya
If things get to hot out in the cold with ya
Froze, froze with ya
Me and you together, our love could run the world
Our love could run the world

[Bridge]
Don't you see there's no love like you and me?
Can't you see, baby, there ain't nobody more powerful than we?
Can't you see that I'm the only thing you'll ever need?
Can't you see that?
Can't you see that?

[Outro]
Our love could run the world
Run the world
Our love could run the world
Run the world
Our love could run the world
Run the world
I'll be your anything, everything
Rock 'n roll with ya
If things get to hot out in the cold with ya
Froze, froze with ya
Run the world
Our love could run the world
Run the world
Our love could run the world
