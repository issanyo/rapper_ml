(Chorus: Flo Rida)
I got my money right, I ain't nothin nice, its goin down tonight, thats what the bitches like all day long, I ain't here for nothin baby, all day long, I ain't here for nothin only cash (X2)

(Flo Rida)
Everythin safe, gotta walk-in safe
Treadmill rapper still runnin in place
All these meals I can share my plate
Flo Rida full yeah I already ate

Plenty to give or take Im bout business
Make no mistake hey this serious this real estate
?
My postition im cuttin cake im the chef in the kitchen late
On my recipe bill gates on the essence Im all the way

Dont worry bout a dolla don dolla with the product?
Ain't no problem if you starta you a starter you get hot up
Grand pieces I got em I get em ballin like somethin
Consider the show stoppa Im all in the damn profit

(Chorus)
(Brisco)
My life is straight Im livin good I ain't hurtin for nothin
I knock the riches in them word but im workin with somethin
The escalade all pearl, you control it with buttons
They keep the tabs on they curb when i come through stuntin
Thats Brisc best to believe it seatin on?
Im the don take it or leave it, throw it in ya face
Big Bs makin it rain no need to hate
Got beef, loadin them thangs, grip the whole case
I got my money right and Im livin up some rubba bands
Hit the club? bet i spend a couple grand (couple grand)

When Im on the scene know that Brisc be a wanted man
