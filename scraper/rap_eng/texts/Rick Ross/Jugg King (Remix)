[Intro: Rick Ross]
Jugg kings
Biggest boss
My lil nigga Scooter heavy (heavy), heavy (heavy)
Heavy (heavy), heavy (heavy), heavy (heavy)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Yayo when I'm on the block, yayo in the coffee pot
Yayo in the rental car, I'm sold out by ten o'clock
Chicken soda, chickens flock, pimp 'em like I'm on the sky
On my third cameraman, I'm the one they want to watch
Can I ran my numbers up, let you niggas fall in love
Shawty I just want to nut, marble floors, I'm out the mud
Game ain't based on zip and fee, saddity bitches feelin' me
I just wanna feed the squad, I just want my feet massaged
Wreck my black Aventador, go get a whole new fleet tomorrow
Friendships, they can get expensive, chilling, yeah that's been a minute
Fed-Ex, I can ship the spinach, Saint Laurent, I been to Lenox
See you talk a lot of money, but it's time to see the deal is

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
You say you a hit man but you ain't hit shit
You say you a lick man but you ain't hit no licks
You say you a dope boy but you ain't sold no bricks
My baby mama left, I bought another nigga's bitch
I do what I want, you do what you can
I stashed away a mil just if shit don't go as planned
I do what I want, you do what you can
I stashed away a mil just if shit don't go as planned

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Fuck niggas do what they can
Real niggas do what they want, yeah
I fuck with Young Scooter and the Black Migo Gang
'Cause I know he gon' keep it A1
Old rooty-rooty finger in the booty ass nigga
Better gon' with the games, shawty we don't play none'
Been waitin' for the fame, learned fuck a gold diggin' bitch
Jack my dick 'fore I ever pay one, yeah yeah yeah
If you au fuck nigga, gotta stay one, huh
You make a lil money, that don't change none', nah
I met her walkin' out the Golden Orchard
Now she bent over with her back archin'
I'm in Aston Martin on the aftermarket
Ignore call, the bitch act retarded
And all's forgiven when I fuck her harder
Payin' no attention, she the preacher's daughter
And this trap music nigga, that's my shit
Nigga tell you anything else, they ain't 'bout shit
Started long time ago in the 'partments
With a Glock and a quarter hole of rock ten
I'm the king nigga when it come to that
Put it on the map, made you want to rap
On your social media you can gon' and cap
But keep this shit a hundred dude, it's only fair, yeah

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
You say you a hit man but you ain't hit shit
You say you a lick man but you ain't hit no licks
You say you a dope boy but you ain't sold no bricks
My baby mama left, I bought another nigga's bitch
I do what I want, you do what you can
I stashed away a mil just if shit don't go as planned
I do what I want, you do what you can
I stashed away a mil just if shit don't go as planned

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
I'm a real nigga, lick hitter, bitch getter
Quick flipper, pot whipper, dope dealer
Fly nigga, if I pop I'ma ride nigga
Goyard, a hundred racks inside nigga
You a fuck nigga, I could get you touched nigga
I be in your hood, so I know what's up with you
You a worker nigga, hang around plugs nigga
You the dope man, you ain't got no drugs nigga
I'm a boss nigga, I'm bossed out like Rick Ross nigga
Five-fifty Benz, you know what that cost nigga
My shit paid for, you paid a note, you ridin' a rental
I got Freebandz, you know Future that's my nigga, Scooter!

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
You say you a hit man but you ain't hit shit
You say you a lick man but you ain't hit no licks
You say you a dope boy but you ain't sold no bricks
My baby mama left, I bought another nigga's bitch
I do what I want, you do what you can
I stashed away a mil just if shit don't go as planned
I do what I want, you do what you can
I stashed away a mil just if shit don't go as planned
