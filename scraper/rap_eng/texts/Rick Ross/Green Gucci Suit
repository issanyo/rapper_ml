[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Lamborghini doors, I wanna touch the sky (woo)
Ain't too many in the city who can roll with I (uuh)
Look who came up out the mud, now he a millionaire (boss)
Try to buy up all the ghettos with a millionaire
Renzel Ravioli, rather Ricky Ross (woo)
Touchin' millions everyday and I'ma trick it off (ahh)
Look, here shawty if you wanna ball (woo)
In my D. Wade jersey so who wanna war
Got me checkin' in the door in my new Gucci boots
Whole squad Gucci'd down, we the Gucci crew
Cuban links, diamonds drippin’ and the newest minks
When you see me, baby girl, just holla, "do your thing"
I... ain't come to play no games
If you catch me with the cash sayin' no names
MI-Yayo was the city for the cocaine
When she bent it over boy, I want the whole thang

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Green Gucci suit, Green Gucci suit (green)
Green Gucci suit, Green Gucci suit (green)
Green Gucci suit, Green Gucci suit (green)

Purple Gucci socks, purple Gucci socks
Milli on her pussy, make 'em pussy pop
Green Gucci bag, green Gucci furniture
Leather's on your head, wrapped around your neck (leggo)
Green Gucci fur, green Gucci fur
Green Gucci purse, green Gucci purse
Got more Gucci clothes than the Gucci store
Gucci on her back, she got Gucci toilet
Oh, you want the Pucci? mix it with the Gucci
Flexin' is a habit, go and stack the 'oobie
Eliantte diamonds, man I'm in a movie
Green Gucci 'Rari, alligator seats
Slidin' all through Dade, slidin' all through Dade
My Opa-locka goons got them Gucci K's
Hundred round clips, talkin' magazine
We Gucci in Lil Haiti & the Pork & Beans (Gang!)
Green Gucci suit make the coochie juice
Green Gucci money make the pussy new
All the Backwoods and the ski masks
All I talk is cocaine, money bag!

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Green Gucci suit, Green Gucci suit (green)
Green Gucci suit, Green Gucci suit (green)
Green Gucci suit, Green Gucci suit (green)
Pack a hundred Backwoods and some Gucci shoes

[Verse 3: Rick Ross & Future]
Models to the cribs, keys to the Coupes
Swallowing the kid, then she in The Loop
Red carpet invitation, Dapper Dan suits
Eight figure contracts, like I really hoop
Blowin' cig' smoke like it's 4/20
Screamin' "Free Meek Mill", count more money
Candy on the Chevy, Gucci on the top
I done seen 20 million, it'll never stop
All she wanna know, is what I wanna know?
And all I wanna know is can you touch your toes?
Manicure to pedi better get it ready
She always call me Llaga, 'cause a nigga petty
Fat boy gotta run her credit check
She done send a lot of texts, I haven't read 'em yet
But I'm likin' all her pics, likin' all the pics
Shawty she the shit, shawty you the shit (green)
I used to send her home and put her on a train
Now I keep it G, and keep it only gang
Green Gucci suit, green Gucci suit
When you rockin' with a Boss, you rock Gucci too (green)
Gucci on my feet, Gucci on my Jeep
Gucci on McLaren, Gucci on the sink
At the St. Regis seven days a week
Turn St. Regis to a bando
Bou ht the Penthouse for my Miami hoe
Gucci everything, from my head to toe
Pay that Gucci bag, pay that Gucci tax , Gucci book bag, got the Gucci strap
Me and Fat Boy got Gucci splash
Turn a two door Wraith to a Maybach (green)

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Green Gucci suit, Green Gucci suit (green)
Green Gucci suit, Green Gucci suit (green)
Green Gucci suit, Green Gucci suit (green)
Pack a hundred Backwoods and some Gucci shoes
Pack a hundred Backwoods and some Gucci shoes
Pack a hundred Backwoods and some Gucci shoes
Green Gucci suit, Green Gucci suit (green)
Green Gucci suit, Green Gucci suit (green)
