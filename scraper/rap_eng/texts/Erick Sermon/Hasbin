Get ready for this passage of mine
I stayed up real late, matching the rhymes
A cowboy tried to catch me, I caught the lasso in time
Dashed him aside, stuck a fashionable knife in his scapula twice

If I ever become a hasbeen on mics, I'll reside in Uber taxis at night
Flashing a dyke on the passenger side
You can't match this passion of mine
You probably dream of the Jackson 5 waxing their thighs

I got a fuck load of uploads for you to get
I'm cut throat, do I give a fuck though? Fuck no
If you been dissing on Krafty
I'll turn up to your listening party and piss in your bacardi

This is for Cardi B and me fisting her arse cheeks
Keep your distance or be hit with a large queef
I gotta be the hardest artist at this
Rip you apart with adlibs, target practise

You heard about the album out now, bow down
We ain't have to have a pow wow for me to have your pals wowed
My shit's out and you can smell it now
They say I'm a dick, I just say I'm well endowed

This vid might as well be a pic of you preparing a cot
'cause I don't give a fuck if you share it or not
These days, you gotta beg for some likes
I'd rather get head from a dyke that's just eaten egg whites and some dead guys head lice

I need to stop talking about my sex drive
But I'm afraid if I don't, my ex might
