[Interlude]
Yeah, yo, Def Squad, Full Cooperation on this one yo, total concentration
Wassup wit these cats out there?, I don't think they figured, son
I don't think they hear you son, ha ha

[Verse 1: Keith Murray]
Now first but not least you will respect Keith
Lay a nigga down like a doo-rag in some grease
You must be crazy, tryin' to play me
I been dedicated since King Tut the third, baby
Lyrical chemist, rhyme menace, diminish you for the benefit
Then continue to kill shit for the fuck of it
I see y'all been writin'
Still bitin'
Still lookin lame
Half y'all niggas still soundin' the same
I'm excitin' when live on stage, when reciting, enlightening, frightening
Lightning throwin' thunder in chain, when I first came
I gave birth to a million MC's in the game
Who should all carry my last name
And I'm Gonna Git You Sucka like Damon Wayans
Insane like Jermaine
Bring pain and Novocaine
Okay, y'all lil monkeys wanna play?
My Squadron brings the Art of War the correct way (OKAY!)

[Hook]
I need your full cooperation and total attention
There's a few things I'd like to mention, these rappers out here swear they're
So appealing I, step to your business and hurt your feelings

[Verse 2: Erick Sermon]
Okay, well thinking it's okay to rhyme that way
You'll be P.O.W., M.I.A
And I'm seven steps ahead of you, five from eternity
An all that shit you kick just don't concern me
I separate the dead from the chump
Ask a nigga blunt, "Yo, how many lumps you want?"
So flavorous you could taste it
So hardcore, I wrote this layin' on the floor in the basement
My style ain't no walk in the park
Got mainstream MCs, scared to rhyme after dark
And there ain't no half-steppin'
I'm reppin' like a nuclear weapon
Manifestin' the Immaculate Conception
Lyrically, I rape an MC like sodomy
Add tragedy, to your odyssey
For battle reservations call 1-900-SQUAD
Frontin' on us, is like frontin' on God

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Redman]
Now when we take it there, these three niggas in the square
My squad hangs out like 400 pounds in braziers
My death-row alliance, bein signed then aligned, too electric
So it clear like a chair in Texas, HOT, approach wit extreme caution
No horsin around when my squad abortion a sound
Our crew's like Smokey off ?sokey?, even Little Bo Peep
Your style is weak
Guard your Rollie, wit all the ice in it
I snatch the ice out and put a price out
Cop a Benz, put my moms in it
As long as I'm alive, I'ma keep the vibe
24/7,  365

[Hook]
