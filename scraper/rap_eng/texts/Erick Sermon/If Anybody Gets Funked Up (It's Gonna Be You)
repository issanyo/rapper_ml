If anybody gets funked
If anybody gets funked up

It's gonna be you
We turn to town to put a smile on your face
But they say "that's illegal"
P-Funk again will put a rock in your face
But they say "that's illegal"
We turn to town to put a smile on your face
But they say "that's illegal"
P-Funk again will put a rock in your face
But they say "that's illegal"
There's a party in the city
Where P-Funk is a way of life
Everybody gettin' funky
Funkin' all thru the night
You came to party with the 'P'
You came to party with the P-Funk
You came to party with the 'P'
You came to party with the P-Funk

Gettin' illegal, gettin' illegal
Funk ain't no sin
And no, we won't go to hell

No unscheduled dancin'
No boom boxes
And no live bands
They're all illegal
If anybody gets funked up
