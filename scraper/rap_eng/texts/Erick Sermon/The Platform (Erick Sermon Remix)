"Dilated"
"Mind created minds"
"Every word is heat" (Feel the impact)
"Dilated expand" "Platform, Platform, Platform" (The remix)

[Evidence]
Yo (It's time to go)
On a plane or don't
Either way, the show must go on, and that I quote
A cat like me, never knew how to backtrack
I open up doors in fact....
I see guys and girls dancin, open up my flows at random
There's no retreat, hold your beats for ransom
No means no and that's my answer, I see in the dark wit my lantern
Triple Optic, Iriscience, Evidence ready to rock it
Of course Babu always in pocket *Babu cut*
That's right, example of a show that's tight
Showin you corny mothafuckers what hip hop's supposed to sound like

Chorus [Iriscience] (Evidence)
You wanna front WHAT?
It's for the heads that know
And if you don't, check the Platform and catch a live show
You wanna front WHAT?
We pro-game selected
Family is family, world wide connected
You wanna front WHAT?
(On beats from the streets, step up party people, every word is heat)
You wanna front WHAT?
(We hit it right and exact, for my peoples in the middle, in the front, in
The back)

[Iriscience]
Aiyyo Rakaa's my name, stealth like spy planes
I defy fire armor, hit higher than migraines
Nobody's sorry on what the state of the art be
Clear the runway, I spread Wings like Paul McCartney
You're now on static, I leave em nervous, in a panic
I'm automatic, every word is cinematic
I turn stages to ?leaders? and turn verses to scenes
See with your ears, I'm turnin speakers into screens
?? Babu blast wit scratch tactics
From my block to rap addicts on Fanatic
I gotta hand it to the Green-Eyed Bandit
Like Bam Rock the Planet, Dilated expand it

Chorus *Evidence part first*

[Iriscience]
This for the ladies lookin forward to clubs these days
And turntablists, radio, and club DJ's
Rocksteady, Dilated create to devastate
Nuttin to prove but then I never hesitate
From Rob-One, Skate, Dream and Don D
For all my people put to the test like Gandhi
The Platform, takes respect to perfect the artform
At times a battleground where rappers get their hearts torn

[Evidence]
Yo our album is nothin short of incredible
I'm from a place called "You Know My Name" clearly legible
Too many days gone by when I ain't feelin shit
Not just talkin but doin it, still revealin it
The Platform, blow trees like bees swarm
Definitely different from the norm (uh-huh)
You wanna front what?
Our strategy, mix words wit alchemy
Evidence, I won't get caught shot on the balcony

Chorus

"Dilated expand" *Cut by Babu 4x*

(The Platform)
