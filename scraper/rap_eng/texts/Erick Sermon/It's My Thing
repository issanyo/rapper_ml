Yeah time to put it down E
Time to put it down E
EPMD Millineum Ducats, DefCon 9, 2 G's
Uh-huh, yeah

Yeah it's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
Ay E-Dub check it out

MCs out there, you better stand clear
EPMD is a world premier
From New York straight talk, America's best
Cold wild Long Island, is where we rest

[Erick Sermon]
Style of the rap, makes your hands clap
Take care of myself because the lines are strapped
Day mean business, no time for play
If you bite a line, we'll roll your way
The more you bite, your body gets hot
Don't get too close, because you might get shot
Gnawin' at my rhyme like a poisonous rat
Don't play dumb, boy, you're smarter than that

[PMD]
It's my thing

[PMD]
The rhythmatic style, keeps the rhyme flowin'
Good friends already bitin', without you knowin'
Can't understand, why your body's gettin' weaker
Then you realize it's the voice from the speaker
The mind become delirious, situation serious
Don't get ill, go and get curious

[Erick Sermon]
'Nuff about that, let's get on to somethin' better
And if gets warm, take off the hot sweater
And if you want some water, I'll get you a cup
And if you don't want it then burn the hell up
I'm tellin' you now boy you ain't jack
Talkin' much junk like Mr. T has your back
But he's not, so don't act cute
'Cause if you do you in hot pursuits

[PMD]
It's my thing

[PMD]
As the song goes on you will notice a change
The way I throw down, the way I say my name
The mic that I'm packin' is flame resistant
So MC be cool, and keep your distance
When I walk into the party girls are screamin' at me
I park my mic in my holst', and then I yell freeze...
Music please

[Erick Sermon]
Ah, where was I? Oh yes
Say a def rhyme then I plumb the rest
Everytime I rock a rhyme I can tell that you like it
Emotion is strong like the mind of a psychic
The mind is weary, floatin' like a dove
Sweatin' a thing like if you was makin' love
Control the crowd, so they can accept it
Total concentration is the perfect method

[PMD]
It's my thing

[PMD]
The wack I subtract, the strong I attack
The ones who grab the mic and freeze, I throw it back
I perfect and eject, make MCs sweat
Take 'em off on the mic then I tell 'em step
Not waiting or debating, 'cause MCs keep hating
Play me too close like two dogs mating

[Erick Sermon]
Now let's get on with the rest of the lesson
Don't really like it when suckers start messin'
Tryin' to make a scene, talkin' very loud
Talkin' much junk to attract a crowd
You say you wanna battle, your first mistake
You get quiet and stuff like you was at a wake
In the beginnin', you knew you wasn't winnin'
Now you feel ashamed, your head starts bendin'
Kinda upset boy -- I understand
You lost again -- I won, god damn

[PMD]
It's my thing

[PMD]
My funky fresh lyrics put you in the spirit
I speak a little louder for you suckers can't hear it
The rhymes I designed are right on time
And at the crowd on my mic flash a danger sign
'Cause I'm the Thriller of Manila, MC cold killer
Drink Budweiser, cannot stand Miller
MCs cold clockin' 'til the party's through
Then they tap me on my shoulder and say "This Bud's for you"

[Erick Sermon]
To be a real MC you can't be obedient
To be smooth is the main ingredient
You have to be silky like a Milky Way
To be able to make it work you rest and play
I control the pace of the rate the rhymes goin'
Hydraulically jacked is the way they're flowin'
Slow yes, just like they're awed
The comparison is wave like the motion of water, smooth

[PMD]
While the record is spinnin', got your fly girlie grinnin'
MD is on the mic, you know I'm only beginnin'
Rhymes fresher than fresh, never heard me fess
Scored 110 on my MC test
My rhymes are strong than Tyson, hold a MC license
When I grab the mic MCs get frightened

[Erick Sermon]
I'm dangerous, I need a cross and bones
Lounge homeboy you in the danger zone
What I mean by lounge I don't mean bitin', huh
You mess around, and we'll be fightin'
It's alright if you bite, but don't recite
Because the rhymes are mine, and that ain't right
But until just chill to the next episode
Donald J, yo, release the code

[PMD]
It's my thing
