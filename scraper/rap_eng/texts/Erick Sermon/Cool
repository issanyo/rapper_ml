(Samples from Eric B & Rakim - Microphone Fiend)

(Cool) Yeah (Cool) Be scared (E! Cool) Hip-Hop Yo!
Eh! Swat! (Know-Know-Know-Know What I Mean!)

Yo I'm cool like Jay
I'm cool like Cee
I'm cool like B
So cool, that's me
I'm cool like a cigarette
I ain't heard a nigga yet
Sayin' I ain't the iller vet
I'm the best they met
Yep, I come correct
Check my report card
As and Bs, (C)see how I do it hard
My technique is Diesel without Vin
Dub by this it end once again my friend
I told ya niggas, I'ma come back with real rap
Like something seen on smack
Yessir! BET know how I live:
My front door drop down to a draw bridge
Big ass kid with a big ass crib (still hood)
Keep a money shoe box on the fridge
Shiet! Nigga know how I do! (Say what?)
Shiet! Nigga seen beef too! I'm...

(Cool! E! Cool!) Uh! (Cause I don't get upset!)
(E! Cool!) Uhm! Yep! (E! Cool!) Yea!
(Know-Know-Know-Know What I Mean!)
(E! Cool!) Word! Dub! (E! Cool!) (Cause I don't get upset!)
(E! Cool!) Uh! (Know-Know-Know-Know What I Mean!)

Verse two! I'm the sickest nigga that did it
My rap style got shiny rims and it's kitted
I'm in the house like a sofa, a chair and a table
Around my neck a fat cable (uh-huh)
I'm posted up like a mail-box
Got cameras all over me like R.Kel's spot
Look at me!
I'm a mixture of Godzilla and Kong
The Don Juan on your block, yo
I'm getting guap, yo
E-Dub I'm nothin but the truth
Transform to Superman when I'm in the booth
The cats think I'm old like "E. can't ride!"
I resurrect like Jesus Christ when he died
I walk out the grave with 4 holes: hands and feet
Then find my squad and hit the streets
Yo! I'm the biggest thing since MySpace
I ain't lettin' no one come in and take my place!
I'm...

(Cool! E! Cool!) Uh! (Cause I don't get upset!)
(E! Cool! E! Cool!) Yea!
(Know-Know-Know-Know What I Mean!)
(E! Cool!) Word! Dub! (E! Cool!) Uh! (Cause I don't get upset!)
(E! Cool!) Uh! (E! Cool!) (Know-Know-Know-Know What I Mean!)

Third verse - when I was released from the slammer
I was the first cat to ever move to Atlanta
Before it got hot I had a rim shot
And then came Two-Short, Scarface and Pac
Half the ATL that's on TV
Either hung around the kid or either worked for me
Cause I'm (Cool!) E-Dub I'm icon status
The first big boy Benz with 20 inch Brabus
I've been there, done that
I hung where you hung at
I ran where you run at
I came where you come at
If you don't know the definition of cool
It's ME! That nigga from E.P.M.D
I'm...

(Cool! E! Cool! Cause I don't get upset!)
(E! Cool! E! Cool!)
(Know-Know-Know-Know What I Mean!)
(E! Cool! E! Cool! Cause I don't get upset!)
(E! Cool! E! Cool! Know-Know-Know-Know What I Mean!)
(E!)

(E!)
(E!)
(Know-Know-Know-Know What I Mean!)
