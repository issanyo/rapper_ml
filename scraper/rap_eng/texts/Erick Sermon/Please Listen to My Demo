Verse One: Parrish Smith

I was coolin' in my car one day you see
Clockin' a double nickel on the L-I E
When it dawned on us that it was, ten o'clock
Turned on the tunes to hear the DJ rock
The hands got to clappin', the fingers start to snappin'
E now was coolin', Brooklyn spirits we was snappin'
Comin' in and out of fantasies on how large we can get
Coolin' in rocks and Benzes with the ground effect kits
I wanted black, E was on the two-tone
Stupid boomin' system with the hand-free phone
The dream gets better and I would like to go on
But I was brought back to reality by a toot of a horn
Smoke everywhere, oh just what we needed
A meeting at twelve, and the car overheated
Feelin' real low, low enough to die
Holdin' up traffic, on the FDR drive
We had to play ourselves, in the fresh dipped gear
E Double had to push while MD steered
There went our dreams, to cool with golden limos
And alls we kept sayin' was please listen to my demo
(listen to my demo)

Please listen to my demo (3X)
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo

Verse Two: Erick Sermon

In the year eighty-seven when we first took off
Then I jumped on P-6-8 and broke North
Walked the big city streets of Manhattan
Buildings, the whole nine yards, so enchantin'
Thinkin' if we got a chance, we could rock it
Funky fresh demo tape in my pocket
We was walkin', and got dissed twice today
Then we stopped at 1974 Broadway
We walked in with grins on our chins
And P had juice with Mr. Virgil Simms
He played the tape and we started to laugh
Played it for Will Soc' and the Sleeping Bag staff
People start to smile, inside we buckwhylin'
Sayin' this all started back from freestylin'
They liked it, and they was very kind
But me and P was like, "Yo G, where do we sign?"
Went in the backroom, things was lovey-dovey
Met Ron Resnick, and his partner Juggy
Things was cool, as I remembered
We signed the dotted line, now we Fresh Record members
Had dreams, of fancy cars and limos
And I wanted was somebody, to listen to my demo

Please listen to my demo
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo
Listen to my demo
Listen to my demo
Demo, d-d-d-d-demo, demo, d-d-demo
Demo, demo, hah, Millennium Ducats, peace
