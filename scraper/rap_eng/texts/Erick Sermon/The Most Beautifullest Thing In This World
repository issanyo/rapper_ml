[Verse 1: Keith Murray]
Y'all mythalogical niggas is comical
The astronomical is coming through like the flu bombing you
And embalming in your crew too
With the musical mystical magical, you know how I do
With word attack skills and vocabulary too
Come to hit you with this edition, it's all brand New
You're through, I'm interplanetarian like Doctor Who
(Who? Who?) So who? (Who?)
Born to get tripped on, word is bond
I'm kicking rhymes 'til the A.M. vultures swarm
Not Quincy, but I'm back on the block and not selling crack
Accompanied with the fat funk flows and tracks
So what you saying black, with all that yackedy yack
My artifacts can't be beat with bats
I'm saying, I eat up everything up on the menu
And bend you and send you swaying, to be continued

[Hook]
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya

[Verse 2]
Spur of the moment opponents is suspects
Caught up in precipitation reign of the tech-
Niques, I speak my concepts freak
The ichi ni san shi funk figures of speech
Now that shit is in the open, I'm open, hoking, scoping
Waitin for the next nigga to get opened on
And break him down like a organic compound
That's the weight of the world as the Earth goes round
Now, how the fuck you sound
I represent my clique, like a four-pound
You better pack your levodopa medication for the shaking
Meditation from the earth, that quaking shit that we be making
Never faking I gets down for my crown clown
Shaking the membrane of Encyclopedia Brown
Freaking the funk in any throw down
While you sustained to the sounds, up in you

[Hook]
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya

[Verse 3]
I comes down breaking ground
So back up off of me and sit your ass down
Now when I'm on the microphone I roam through zones
But don't be trying this shit at home
No matter what race, creed, color him or her
I comes cleaner than Jeru and Damage an amateur
As chronical facial disorders occur
I'll assassinate your character's caliber
I channel my anger, from the double edged banger
And turn into the microphone strangler
So stop tryna see where your eyes can't follow
Say goodnight to the world and goodbye to tomorrow
You rave and cuss so it's a must you get bust
We're not to be fucked with, Toys Ain't Us
For eternity, through infinity
I eternally, get in you

[Hook]
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya

[Outro]
What you folks want, yeah
We got the funk so come on down
What you folks want, yeah
We got the funk so come on down
What you folks want
We got the funk so come on down
