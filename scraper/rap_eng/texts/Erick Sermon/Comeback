[Verse 1: Cloud Envy]
I destroy what's in my path with one whole blast
Flow so toxic better grab yah get yah gas mask
Fools stay acting out when they ain't even get cast
Tryna keep up with my pace but you can't hold fast
I get the last laugh while you get gagged
Come through pursin raps like they came out the bag
I show no mercy my hearts cold and so is this
Ignorance is bliss
Grab the mic I am a pacifist, with my passive fist
Natural habitat of a lyricist, the mighty of the mightiest
To show you all I do is this
No time for this
All Fury. You see I've had it
I tricked the little leprechaun so there's no silly rabbit
Smoked fools out even if they asthmatic
MCs can't keep up it's really so tragic
Yah raps plastic
Oh wait you think you so RIDIC-COAST COAST
If rapping is a drug I hope I don't overdose and
Overload up on you fools annihilate it's adios
Man I Just hope that you all don't get mistaken
I'm here to wide awaken
To show you I'm the best in the making
So just peep what I'm making
Flow so cold I got yah spine all shaken
I'm earthquakin
Don't say you feel me cause there is no relation
So just peep what i'm making

*Hold up let me spit the second*

[Verse 2: Cloud Envy]

I told em
To sit and come relax
Cause the Cloud back to attack
With murder weapon to kill on any track that's a fact
Cause I said it and anybody wants it they can come and get it
Murder any MC I think they need a medic
I serve fools like Jeffery Burtrome and Benson all in one
Flows  aball in park cause I spit that home run
Leave out with the dub when it's all said and done
Rhymes so electric i got you all looking stun
I'm jack Chop em down like lumber saw so loud
That I woke them up from they beauty slumber
Yah favorite lyricist from the down under
You want a chance at the kid
Then you bets to take a number
Enthused by this rap I think I'm over zealous, the bars so hards
I got The Rock looking jealous
This that dome rap
Coming from the brainiac
I think I lost my mind somebody tell me where my brain is at
More insane then a maniac on Sugar rush
Two black cats and going through a heart attack
Its that new Dark Knight
Somebody tell bats that he's been replaced
And he should throw in a welcome mat
So everybody raise your top hats to the
Groovy Cat, that will soon be the greatest to have ever Spat
Clean out you fools like maintenance
And if only time will tell them you bets be patient
It's a pleasure to have made your acquaintance
Hi my name is Cloud and I be's a very quaint kid
Flows unknown I think i'm in the Matrix
The first of April flow
Cause i'm coming with these rap tricks

[Acapella Verse: Cloud Envy]

And they screaming who's who
Cause I'm the one yah see
Tryna put me in a trap but ain't no stoping me
I got the game on lock as I control the key, must I repeat
Myself when I say I am no one to be dealt with
With so much rage in these lyrics I wonder if you had felt this
This to be spoken by only me
As I PROceed to make history
The destiny of a MC that is meant to be
CLOUD ENVY...
