I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot

Open the door, feel the breeze
And park that ass like AJ's and Free's
But this section's E's behind the rope
If you're not with me, freeze, back the hell up

(I'm hot)
DJ's know what time it is
Kid Capri, Flex, S, Clue or Biz
It is off the lid, spot's type crazy
Cat's up in here got more bling than baby

I'm not ice rockin', Cristal poppin'
The type to rebound with chicks I'm not Rodman
I gotta girl with a butt big as Trina's
And green eyes but mines are greener

(Oh baby, I'm hot)
I keep it simple like, add and subtract
One color, everything I rock is black
Like that black chic, black whips
Black Amex, card brand new, never ran it

I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven, ooh
(Oh baby now, let's get down tonight)
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven, ooh
(Oh baby now, let's get down tonight)
(No doubt)
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven, ooh
(Oh baby now, let's get down tonight)
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven, ooh
(Oh baby now, let's get down tonight)

1 A.M
Pandemonium
Song comes on Ja Rule and Lil' Mo and 'em
So hot, the spot's outrageous
It's Ron and Kelly Chante contagious

(I'm hot)
Records heard, DJ's playin' 'em
My words are being relayed, who's sayin' 'em?
Ay yo, we are
My name's drama, that's why it starts with ER

(I'm hot)
I'm by far the best stop the racket
I'm a master with a mic and green jacket
They can beat the traffic, write somethin' and run it
Add a hot boy threw with me and stun it

(I'm hot)
Still cats wanna outlash me
I'll smash, outlast your best M. C
Make him trash that CD, crash that seat
Head bang through the window when he heard the E

I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven, ooh
(Oh baby now, let's get down tonight)
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven, ooh
(Oh baby now, let's get down tonight)
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven, ooh
(Oh baby now, let's get down tonight)
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven, ooh
(Oh baby now, let's get down tonight)

Yeah, everybody in the house come on
(Now baby, let's get down tonight)
Yeah, uh, grab somebody on the floor, come on
(Now baby, let's get down tonight)

Uh, feel the music get into it come on
(I'm hot)
(Now baby, let's get down tonight)
Yo stop the hate, appreciate, c'mon
(Now baby, let's get down tonight)

3 uh, lights out let's bounce
(I'm hot)
Get it crunked, before the last songs announced
T Braxton heat, track I burn
While you go left, I make a right turn

(I'm hot)
Def Squad no one does it better
If it gets warm take off the hot sweater
Funklord that's my handle black
Breaker, breaker one nine right, you copy that

I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven, ooh
(Oh baby now, let's get down tonight)
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven, ooh
(Oh baby now, let's get down tonight)
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven, ooh
(Oh baby now, let's get down tonight)
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven
(Oh baby now, let's get down tonight)

Oh baby now, let's get down tonight
(Ooh)
Oh baby now, let's get down tonight
(Ohh)
Oh baby now, let's get down tonight
(Ohh)
Oh baby now, let's get down tonight
