The employees of the year, yeah, we're back to work
I took time off, while other rappers got jerked
Due to the fact they wack in their track
Have to go back and stack 'cause they lack
The ingredients EPMD and scratch for that...
*DJ Scratch cuts and scratches*
Yo, I'm the hip-hopper, plus the show shocker
Down with MD, yes, the microphone doctor
One wrecks, the other destroys
And if you think that you're ready to mess (Kill the noise)
We don't play when it's time to slay
I get a cut from my homey, yo, then I lay
Back and mack and all the rhymes I pack
And wait for a sucker to jump and then attack

[Parrish Smith]
Well, I'm known to be the master in the MC field
No respect in '87, '88, you kneel
Cause I produce and get loose, when it's time to perform
Wax a sucker like Mop & Glow (That's word bond)
Smacked a second time, but on a different assignment
And do a sucker new jack who needs a rappin' alignment
'Cause I'm the cream of the crop when it's time to do a show
Girlies on my jock for my dope intro
As I glance at E-Double, king microphone wrecker
Turn on my cordless, sayin' mic checka
To the ladies ... and all party goers
Some call me P, and others slow flower
Brothers on my jock, for the way I hold a piece of steel
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?

[Erick Sermon]
Puttin' heads to bed, straight out the box
MCs are jumpin' out shoes and socks
I'm not playin', understand what I'm sayin'
Catch a sucker in my way, and I'm slayin'
Takin' no shorts, showin' vital sign
You can tell by my lines that I'm gettin' mines
In '89, because I'm fine as wine
Sit back and recline, watch the sun shine
Take a stroll, listen to rock and roll
Catch a flick at the movies, dance or bowl
What I choose I refuse to slack while I'm back
I take a chance jack, so I must attack
With knick knack paddywack so I won't lack
Oh, my style is def, and as deadly as crack

[Parrish Smith]
While I'm slayin' music's playin', a sucker is the lame
Battle in the trenches where the funky beat playin'
'Cause with a partner like E Double don't come a dime a dozen
Not kin or blood-related, but you can call us cousins
'Cause as we climb the charts, better known as statistics
Brothers on my jock while I'm kickin' ballistics
Droppin' hits like 'I'm Housin,' 'You Gots To Chill,' and more
The proof is in the pudding (Yo, check the Billboard)
People round town talkin' this and that
Of how we sound like the R, and our music was wack
Dropped the album Strictly Business and you thought we would fold
Thirty days later, the LP went gold
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?

[Erick Sermon]
Now party people it's time for the exquisite
No knock knock who that over there or who is it
It's the E-R-I-C-K, yes, the Boy Wonder
No fouls, no bleeps, no bloops or no blunders
So hot, so you can say I'm blazin'
Or Luther Vandross says, yo I am
"Sooooooo amazing, and I've been waiting"
For a sucker to attack yo me the E-Double
'Cause me and PMD is like the funky fresh couple

[Parrish Smith]
I fight fire with fire, that's why most retired
And when we needed a piss boy, you was hired
'Cause you was mesmerized, for that style that we was bringin'
In an all-out battle, P comes out swingin'
'Cause I'm just the type of brother that's out to get mines
And if the odds against me, I still drop lines
And get mines on time, that's why most resign
Sit in my La-Z-Boy chair, relax my head and recline
Sip a Pepsi or Coke, with a twist of lime
Or crack a forty-oh, and then I go for mine
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?
