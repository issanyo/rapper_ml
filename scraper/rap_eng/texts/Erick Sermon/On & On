It goes on and on
We won't stop to the break of dawn, go
On and on, got to keep on movin' on
On and on till we get enough
You know how we do it
Feels so good to see everybody down with me
Everything is alright 'cause we're groovin' to this vibe
Life can be so sweet if you can swing with me
Party's on tonight, everybody knows
(That there's no doubt about it)
Baby it's on, I'm ready to dance all night long
(Find somebody)
Get my groove on, party through the night
Until the morning light
(You know how we do it)
It goes on and on
We won't stop to the break of dawn, go
On and on, got to keep on movin' on
On and on till we get enough
You know how we do it
I know just what to do
To get the best from you, uh, uh
(Baby I can tell you what I got to show you)
I'm flexible, sexible, some say I'm incredible
Oh, you're gonna like it
(That there's no doubt about it)
Baby it's on, I'm ready to dance all night long
(Find somebody)
Get my groove on, party through the night
Until the morning light
(You know how we do it)
It goes on and on
We won't stop to the break of dawn, go
On and on, got to keep on movin' on
On and on till we get enough
You know how we do it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I grab the mike and I react like Noah
The rhyme flow of my style is Rocky Balboa
We makes it hot like Coko, Lelee and Taj
Oh my God
I be the flyest thing since TV
And y'all watchin' me and SWV
Prompt the lawn chair lay back like the rap word is bond
And let's rock the spot on and on uh
It goes on and on
We won't stop to the break of dawn, go
On and on, got to keep on movin' on
On and on till we get enough
You know how we do it
It goes on and on
We won't stop to the break of dawn, go
On and on, got to keep on movin' on
On and on till we get enough
You know how we do it
It goes on and on
We won't stop to the break of dawn, go
On and on, got to keep on movin' on
On and on till we get enough
You know how we do it
