My heart beats I hate thieves I'm all about it
I watch em judge my friend Tone till he's all surrounded
And even though he'll cross lines like he's out of bounds
Still hit the shot at the buzzer but it doesn't count

And that's the friend zone don't you hate the friend zone?
Rather do the one hand grab like in the end zone
I never stopped to settle foot was never off the pedal
Never sent me any beats so I just went accapella

I think you're blind if you can't see the plan
Old soul, young body call me peter pan
Look I'm always lying and never caring about it
So are your favorite rappers who try to claim that their bout it
Look it's really funny it's really truly astounding how I grew up
In a city where people never come out of

My favorite shit is whenever you wanna doubt us saying all
These damn lies when you know nothing about us
My mother she finished college she even went and got masters
Ima mastermind but really grew up a bastard I had a problem
With smoking I only hit if its potent, I won't care about my
POTUS if I'm way across the ocean

Miles away from the phonies and the small bills everything
Is corny I feel like I'm Holden Caulfield

The only shit that stays the same nowadays is the art of war and these lames I pray
For a brighter future I'm use to people who tell a lie cause if I
Told the truth I would never be televised
I arrived A.I on game day and I am the answer but its funny cause I won't play

Call me Ishmael talk about a fish scale, you never read a book except that one about that big whale
I told her straight up she had nice thighs, she called me a pig so I'm the lord of the flies
She thought that was funny and got no reply, cause I suck at texting i'm just one of those guys

Living life extra woulda thought you saw the tabloid sleepin like ramadas ima baller like the bad boys
Slim pickins you a chicken im the fast choice cause I'm extra funny and shit, I'm mad poise

Quick to get it I'm fightin demons like jack torrence mad so much porn you would have thought it was bad torrents

She poppin' ass its funny because she's mad foreign and she's extra asian so really she ain't got ahhhhhh
