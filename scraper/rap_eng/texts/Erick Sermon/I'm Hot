[Verse 1 - Erick Sermon]
(I'm Hot) Open the door, feel the breeze
And park that ass like Aj's and Free's
But this section's E's behind the rope
If your not with me freeze back the hell up
(I'm Hot) DJs know what time it is
Kid Capri, Flex, S, Clue or Biz
It is off the lid, spot's type crazy
Cats up in here got more bling than Baby
I'm not ice rockin crystal poppin
The type to rebound with chicks I'm not Rodman
I gotta girl with a butt big as Trina's
And green eyes but mines are greener
(I'm Hot) I keep it simple like add and subtract
One color, everything I rock is black
Like that black chick black whips
Black AMEX card brand new never ran it

[Hook]
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooooh
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooooh
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooooh
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooooh

[Verse 2: Erick Sermon]
1 Am....pandemonium
Song comes on Ja Rule and Lil Mo and 'em
So hot the spot's outragious
It's Ron and Kelly Chante contagious
(I'm Hot) Records heard, Dj's playin 'em
My words are being relayed who's sayin 'em?
Ay yo!!!! we are
My name's drama that's why it starts with ER
(I'm Hot) I'm by far the best stop the racket
I'm a master with a mic and green jacket
They can be the traffic write somethin and run it
Add a hot boy threw with me and stun it
(I'm Hot) Still cats wanna outlash me
I'll smash outlast your best MC
Make him trash that cd, crash that seat
Head bang thru the window when he heard the E

[Hook]
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooooh
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooooh
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooooh
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooooh

[Bridge: Erick Sermon]
Yeah, everybody in the house come on (Now baby let's get down tonight)
Yeah, uh, grab somebody on the floor come on (Now baby let's get down tonight)
Uh, feel the music get into come on (Now baby let's get down tonight)
Yo stop the hate, appreciate (Now baby let's get down tonight)

[Verse 3: Erick Sermon]
Verse 3 uh, lights out let's bounce
Get it crunked, before the last songs announced
T Braxton heat, track I burn
While you go left, I make a right turn
(I'm Hot) Def Squad no one does it better
If it gets warm take off the hot sweater
Funklord that's my handle black
Breaker breaker one nine roger copy that

[Hook]
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooooh
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooooh
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooooh
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooooh
