[14. Crossover - EPMD]
TUTORIAL LA MIXTAPE

Let's get up, let's get down
(Roll with the hardcore funk, the hardcore sound) (x7)
Let's get wit this, mackadocious funk material
So simple, when I rock wit the instrumental
Who am I (E-D the Green Eyed Bandit)
Control my career so I can never get stranded
But the rest are gettin' Brand Nubian
Changed up they style, from jeans to suits and
Thinking about a pop record, somethin' made for the station
For a whole new relation-
Ship of a new type of scene
To go platinum and clock mad green
AKA, a sellout, the rap definition
Get off that boy, change your mission
Come back around the block
Pump Color Me Badd to the ah, tick tock
Let them know your logo, not a black thing
My background sing, my background sing for the crossover

[Hook]
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
I wanna do it for you, I do

The crossover

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
I wanna do it for you, I do
