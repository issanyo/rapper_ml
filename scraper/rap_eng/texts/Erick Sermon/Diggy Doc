It's the Diggy Diggy Doc y'all, pumpin it yes y'all
D.O.C. on the system, we kick it fresh y'all
Lettin the bass thump on and strong and hard for PPP
Engineerin the cut is E Double E

Yo, it's the Diggy Diggy Doc y'all! ..
Yo, yo yo, when I hear a "BASS"

This goes out to my niggas and y'all bitches
The Benzes, Range Rovers, and sixty-four switches
The C.I.A., Feds and even dogs sniffin
I plant a bomb right by the bar when it starts kickin
Doc stompin ground, Brick City hound WHAT?
Guerillas out the jungle get gritty now WHAT?
I'm walkin barefooted over loads of hot coal
Cuts from the snot-nose keep your barbershop closed
When it goes, Flex don't have to drop the bomb on it
I keep my speech, +Bleek+, and my right mind on it
So when it's time, I'm heard in the streets
My mammal animal skin, excitin all the birds in your Jeep
I'm crazy nigga, when I was young
I spread and shaved both legs to my babysitter
Ran into Bebe's Kids in a baby pickup
Shot up Toys R Us and robbed Kay-Bee nigga!
This is +Def+ poetry far beyond my control
Fuck your teflon, we body-armed like the Toad
Unload from my Girbauds and make it hot for homey
I puff so much of that green I BLEED guacamole
It's like Shaq and Kobe, I beef for four quarters
Callin veternarians to get the doggs off ya
"Animals Attack - Part Four," people starin
I'm not the type of Focker that'll go and _Meet_ your _Parents_
I'm outside trick or treatin, fuck if my chick is cheatin
I'm hungry as FUCK, and I hope you niggas sick of eatin
It's like the fourth letter, tenth letter, third letter
Chickenhawk bird-getter, holla if you heard better
I got a chick with no-ass-a'tall
I fuck her for the love of that money, not basketball
And when my man comes home, and the Def Squad is back
YO, GIMME THAT RAP GAME, WE'LL TAKE CHARGE OF THAT
