[Intro: Ja Rule]
Uh, yeah
It's Ja Rule baby, yeah
It's E-Dub, yeah
Def Squad, uh

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Y'all motherfuckers think it's a game right?
Get da name right
R-U-L-E baby
My shit is airtight
Compressed, dead all da non-sense
Pass da 4-5th and load up the cartridge
E Reved up da 6
We about to blow out like bitches wit bad kids
Once you feeling the slugs hit
Datz as real as it gets
Then you wonder
Why da quake can come from underneath, while you figure it out
You on da streets
Laid out wit da gun still stuck in yo mouth
Fuckin' wit Ja is somethin' niggas fearfully doubt
'Cause I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, god may I ask from yo prayer so my soul don't die
These is real tears I cried
And dreams don't lie
When they tell me that I'm doin' good in da devils eyes
But I preach to I'm
Be that same, Nigga put da heat to I'm
Askin E Dub what da fuck you want do to I'm

[Verse 2: E-Dub]
E-Dub and Ja
An eye for an eye, Gat for Gat
Peep Game, Cover the Mic and Spit Flamez
Two cats who come strapped, self-contained
Ain't shit this raw since Big Daddy Kane
Heavyweight, I knock a Nigga out in two
Put him to sleep, see dreams and swear it wasn't true
Look at you, lame, I'm iller, rhyme killa
Comin' through like da return of Godzilla

[Chorus: Ja Rule & E-Dub]
Now can I tell ya
E and Ja top dogs, def squad
Fuckin wit us is like, suicide
Bow down, real niggas on da move comin' through blazin' you
'Cause we are livin' life
Thug style, Hennesey, blazin' trees
Gettin' G's, indeed, 'cause we will do or die
Right now by any means
Words is bond word is bond

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Ain't nobody touchin' the ground that I walk on
My Love, It's just so strong
If you crossin' me you dead wrong
And you know 'cause you feel it in yo heart nigga
And you don't sleep 'cause yo soul might fall apart nigga
If you feelin' me now
The strength got you settlin' down
We puttin' in work
In otha words we puttin' in rounds
Take two for now
Ja and E-Dub
Strictly for the love
We fuck hoes and bust slugs, nigga
Why in da world would you put me in da position
To put niggas out of commission, love, willin' and wishin'
'Cause I'm feeling the need to cut off da air that you breathe
By any means it's Ja and E no in beetweens

[Verse 4: E-Dub]
Now we move agile
You and yo niggas is fragile
Like glass and UPS boxes, Shit watch this
Still housin', the year 2000's now
So fear this or we in yo face niggas, BLAAU

[Chorus: Ja Rule & E-Dub]
Now can I tell ya
E and Ja top dogs, def squad
Fuckin wit us is like, suicide
Bow down, real niggas on da move comin' through blazin' you
'Cause we are livin' life
Thug style, Hennesey, blazin' trees
Gettin' G's, indeed, 'cause we will do or die
Right now by any means
Words is bond word is bond

[Verse 5: Ja Rule]
Now what I love is to see my niggas on top
And I feel that we can't be stopped
And my life don't mean shit to me
But my life gon make history
Feel me, a nigga ain't supposed to be
As deadly, and you ain't even close to me
Respect me, 'cause we livin' dangerously
Luv me, 'cause y'all can't even fuck wit me

[Chorus: Ja Rule & E-Dub]
Now can I tell ya
E and Ja top dogs, def squad
Fuckin wit us is like, suicide
Bow down, real niggas on da move comin' through blazin' you
'Cause we are livin' life
Thug style, Hennesey, blazin' trees
Gettin' G's, indeed, 'cause we will do or die
Right now by any means
Words is bond word is bond
Uh
