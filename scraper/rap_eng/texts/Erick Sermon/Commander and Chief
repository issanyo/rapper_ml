[Intro: Erick Sermon] (Daz)
Check one, two, uh uh eh eh eh ah ah ah ah ah yeah! (A One two one two)
Uh uh! (A one two one two) California! Yeah! Uh!
E! E Dub! Dogg Pound! (DPG!) Uh Huh!

[Verse One: Erick Sermon]
Yo! I'm in the zone tonight with no special guest and...
In the recession the E's progressin
Eye candy stay in my session
So when I write, I'm cool, with no regression
I'm focused now almost restin
'Cause, I do it in my sleep caressin
The beat's like it's a chick, from Straight Stuntin (SLAY!!!)
Give it to her hardcore like it's nothin!
Uh! I Roc like Charles Dutton (Uh Huh!)
And I call the shots, then I push the buttons
So when it comes to war, I nuke 'em
You know you done fucked up right! Bill Duke 'em
You can, do what I say or lay like carpet
The New York area I ran that market (Uh Huh!)
Flush the whole decade I ran like faucet
Or weight, like The Biggest Loser, you lost it

[Chorus: Daz]
You can see me in the flyest thing that I think is
It's brown guess what my drink is?!
Chicks catchin Vapors but I ain't Biz
I'm the commander, chief with the answer

[Erick Sermon]
I advise y'all to be like we, if you wanna become a success like we
All up in your prime stay fresh like we
Watch what I'm doin I did this before

[Verse Two: Daz]
I pull up at the G spot (VROOM VROOM!!!) My sound boomin
And I'm West Coast upped!!!! That's what I'm doin
And I do it the most, won't stop won't quit
You know how us gangstas do it yeah BANG THAT SHIT!!!
Ha Ha! Get your walk on do that dance (J!!)
Get your boogie on get in a stance
Drink spillin, 808 hittin nobody shootin and killin
'Cause everybody 'round here be chillin
(Now what we gonna do?) Get your party on
All night long (From two until the break of dawn)
BOUNCE! Put your motherfuckin hands up
HOMEBOY! If your hatin shut the fuck up!
Low low ragtop, drive coupes and fly shit
Black tie party and I'm comin with a bad bitch
Weed blowin so the party ain't over
We do this shit all night 'til six in the mornin!!!

[Chorus: Daz]
You can see me in the flyest thing that I think is
It's brown guess what my drink is?!
Chicks catchin Vapors but I ain't Biz
I'm the commander, chief with the answer

[Erick Sermon]
I advise y'all to be like we, if you wanna become a success like we
All up in your prime stay fresh like we
Watch what I'm doin I did this for before
