[Verse 1: MC Lyte]
I like giving life to the mic boards
Like MJ give crack to back boys
Notice I'm focused
To perfection, I'm the closest
The best and you know this
Try not and I become the coldest
Giving dudes the cold shoulders
I'm like the water in my daughters
And they clear like roaches
When I step through they get treated and stepped to
Like my nephew and my nieces
You should hold on to them Jesus pieces
Like your life's dependent on it you should be offended
No one opposes and walks away with the winnings
Not when I got my black and white with the Crimson, high

[Hook: MC Lyte]
Y'all don't wanna mess with us
We can't be stopped, we can't be touched
No matter how hard they try, Jordan brand stay fly
Tell them haters bye bye

[Verse 2: MC Lyte]
Listen, above and beyond, we on
We interlace like laces and it may sound basic, but we strong
We interlock like chains, that represent the pain
Hard work to sustain what we gain
We made to create, and others are made to hate
We overcome the dumb nonsense that awaits
Thou shall not forsake the game
I am to bring pain to those who misuse my name
A heavyweight moving at a steady pace
To say he's great, a huge understatement
Wait, man, Jordan effect is what you facing
The man, the shoe, the brand, it's amazing

[Hook]
