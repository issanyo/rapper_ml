Yeah, one room, Representing, Def Squad coast, yeah, ah, y'all know bout that? Check it

[Erick Sermon]
It goes, knick knack, patty-wack, give a dog a bone
You a customer, so kneel before me, the E
Matter of fact, like the group home, give me dap
To being the first one to bring the Zapp clap to rap
Look at that, i got the whole house jumpin'
Off the hook, like my little black book(Uhhuh)
The original flavor, Run-DMC era
Microphone terror, so who can do it betta?
I'm in the mixture, I recite funk scripture
Freeze you, like Kodak picture, cheesy
Expertise, doper than thesegrown trees
I'm on the money strap, so you can call me Donny
Fly hyper, Professional lyrical sniper
Who comes tighter, than the virgin, servin';
Last chance, so if you wanna go to rounds wit the Def Squad
Motherfucker, Let's Dance

[Hook]X2
[Redman] Funkorama!
[Erick] Yeah the place to be, for the underground
To groove to the funk sound so
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
With E and R-E-D
[Redman] We get down like that

[Verse 2: Redman]
CAUTION! Your hearing aid is needed, stay weeded
I'm consecutively bleeding eardrums repeating
The bombzee taking the heat since I was a fetus
Rocking Adidas when I first sipped on Easy Jesus
Copastetic, how you like it, whole or shredded
Mics get breaded, saute, cause I'm a pro at wetting
I'm getting, smarter than Agent 86
You beating me?, one-on-one? Then that fight is crazy fixed
Open up that chest like Vicks, when I write them
Then leaves you marks brains, more questions than Asylum
You got a crew? You better tell them, or hide them
I stay more focused than wide lens when I'm inside them
Yo, E, Scream on these stinking MC's
Three times three, reality, virtuality, can't see
I plant seeds and MC's that can't
Fertilize their rhymes, I drop lines till they can't breathe
Shucky ducky quack quack, on that ass crack
Got blast on, I blast back, Funkorama
I got a trunk o' trauma, to smoke constant
Dramas caused by the bomb shit, love ya momma

[Hook]X2
