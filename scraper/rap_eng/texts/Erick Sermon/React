[Intro]
Just Blaze, yeah
Check me out now
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Check me out now
Yo, yo, yo
Let me hear ya say
(Kisi ko) Uh huh
(Khudkushi ka) Uh huh
(Shok ho tow) Uh huh
(Kya kare?) Yeah
Put your hands in the air everybody, c'mon
Where them dogs at? (*Roof roof roof roof roof*)

[Verse 1: Erick Sermon]
I'm immaculate, come through masculine
Wide-body frame, E-Dub's the name whoa
In the field of rap, I'm superb, I'm fly
I should be in the sky with birds (*caw caw caw*)
I ride twenty inch rims when I lean yo
('Ey yo them tens, nigga)
I know, I keep 'em clean though
Come through storm the block like El Ni√±o
Scoop up an Arabic chick before she close
She goes (Kisi ko)
Those my people
(Yeah them broads from Puerto Rico, them Keith's folks)
Yeah watch how the E locs 64
Black rags, black interior, shift on the floor
Burn out, I do it for the kids
They're hopping the turnstile, the E going wild
(Yo like them White chicks on a DVD?)
Yeah I'm worldwide, MTV and BET, nigga

[Chorus]
(Kisi ko khudkushi ka shok ho tow uh huh kya kare?)
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react

(Kisi ko khudkushi ka shok ho tow uh huh kya kare?)
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react

[Verse 2: Redman]
Do I gotta go ape or go nutty
I leave your eye like a 9-9 Benz-buggy, puffy
Brick niggas get real ugly
Trust me, keep your four if you feel lucky
Mug me, I ain't got nothin' but four figures
And weed and hash chopped in the coffee blender
My shots like squeegee men on your window
Usual Suspect, I'm the crippled member
Get away when I sat down in the office
Heat in my lap keep me walking awkward
While y'all talk it, the doc reinforce it
The mic, it's hard to keep my paws off it
Your bitch is my bitch when it's over
No Cristal, I pulled up a King Cobra
Out in the Nova, don't bother
My Nino Brown bust, it'll shut down the corridor

[Chorus]
(Kisi ko khudkushi ka shok ho tow uh huh kya kare?)
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react

(Kisi ko khudkushi ka shok ho tow uh huh kya kare?)
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react

[Verse 3: Erick Sermon]
Hey yo Red, he's over (Word?)
We the shit right now
Watch this (*applause*) told ya
Chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chilling
(I'm Milk) I'm that kid Gizmo, we Top Billing

[Redman]
Yo, when the roof is on fire, believe it, it's me
Sparks when I rock the mic like Sigel and Free
When the pen hit the pad, the evil in me come out
Total Recall for people to breathe
I got dogs in the backyard shitting in lawns
(We got chickens ain't leaving till six in the morning)
Round and round we go, circle the area
(Leave the party, go straight to the Marriott)
Do-si-do with cowboys where they saddle at
(Rodeo with twenty-fours on the Cadillac)
(What yo name is?!) R.E.D
Crack cost money (but the E is free) yeah

[Chorus]
(Kisi ko khudkushi ka shok ho tow uh huh kya kare?)
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react

(Kisi ko khudkushi ka shok ho tow uh huh kya kare?)
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react

[Chorus]
(Kisi ko khudkushi ka shok ho tow uh huh kya kare?)
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react

(Kisi ko khudkushi ka shok ho tow uh huh kya kare?)
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react
