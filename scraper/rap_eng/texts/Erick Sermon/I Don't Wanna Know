[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just keep it to myself

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creeping please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

[Verse 2]
I think about it when I hold you
When looking in your eyes, I can't believe
I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creeping please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

[Bridge]
Did he touch you better than me?
Did he watch you fall asleep?
Did he show you all the things that you used to do to me?
Then you're better off that way
Baby, all that I can say
If you're gonna do your thing
Baby, don't come back to me
Oh, oooh, oh

[Outro]
Baby don't come back to me, yeah
Oh, oooh, oh
No I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
If you're creeping, please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
If you're creeping, please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
Oooh, ooooh, ooooh
