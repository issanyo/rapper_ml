[Intro: Playa, Erick Sermon & Too $hort]
We can go on and on
Ah ha, one two y'all
Uh uh, nobody, ah

[Verse 1: Eric Sermon]
Woo, woo, this is E, Short Dog and Sweat
We vets, coming through, hot to death
Place your bets, baguettes swing from the neck
Make wanna-be playas show us mad respect (word up)
Yo, dog (whassup?)
He daughter said it's cheaper to keep her
If she gets fly then, hmm (leave her)
E, G hooked it up, Short dog and Sweat
Got the average girl wanna inhale and catch her breath (What, what, what, what)

[Chorus: Playa]
We can go on and on
We can go on and on
Don't sleep on
Our love jones
'Cause we got it goin' on
You know it ain't wrong
We can go on and on
We can go on and on and on and on
Our love jones
Not to be sleepin' on
We can go along

[Verse 2: Keith Sweat]
In the morning when the sunlight hits my eyes
I just lay there thinkin' how your lovin' keeps me in a jive
Ain't no question, you can love me baby, like nobody can
What you do to me, my baby girl, I just don't understand
Now we can go on

[Chorus: Playa]
We can go on and on
We can go on and on
Don't sleep on
Our love jones
'Cause we got it goin' on
You know it ain't wrong
We can go on and on
We can go on and on and on and on
Our love jones
Not to be sleepin' on
We can go along

[Verse 3: Keith Sweat]
I would never ever, baby do you wrong (ha)
In the midnight hour I will always keep this lovin' strong
Just surrender your love, baby girl, and I'll surrender mine
All I wanna do right now, my girl, is baby, take my time
(Huh, nah-mean, word up)
So we can go on

[Chorus: Playa]
We can go on and on
We can go on and on
Don't sleep on
Our love jones
'Cause we got it goin' on
You know it ain't wrong
We can go on and on
We can go on and on and on and on
Our love jones
Not to be sleepin' on
We can go along

[Verse 4: Too $hort]
I ain't yo baby, ain't got no tattoos
But when I walk in the room they pose like statues
I size 'em all up, I used to take my pick
But now I'm on some high powered new improved shit
Deep down inside, it never goes away
I just might knock a few hoes today
It's okay, I really get paid makin' phone calls
Told you once before, I'm in it for the long haul
The last in the business, make the transition
Do I have what it takes or do you have the right intentions to git with a playa
Even if it means you gotta play the background so you can see some green
No video's or groupies, whoever got the talent
Rush her to the house and let her pose for the camera
Don't let the freak in you keep you up all night
Get your money on girl, don't waste your life

[Chorus: Playa]
We can go on and on
We can go on and on
Don't sleep on
Our love jones
'Cause we got it goin' on
You know it ain't wrong
We can go on and on
We can go on and on and on and on
Our love jones
Not to be sleepin' on
We can go along
