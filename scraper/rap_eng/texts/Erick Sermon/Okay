[Redman and Erick Sermon]
Live at the tunnel y'all
Big Kap and Funk Flex (look around)
Hit me back y'all, Def Squad y'all
Hold it down, look around

[Erick Sermon]
I rock house from old folks to childern
Squad comin through knockin down your building
Lyrical murderer, who you be?
We never heard of ya
Momma's boy from West Suburbia
You don't belong 'round here so what you doing
Keep persuin my crew and get ruined, screw 'em
Redman (What up?) How you feelin
Lets wheel 'em and deal 'em until the pain is peelin
I wish a few of y'all would stop stealin
]From the mass appealin, dough stacked to the ceiling
Ohhh, imagine rap attack is coming
Cause my sayin something, I rot like Charles Dutton
E-dub be the best thing runnin
When my jam comes on DJ's just start cuttin (cha-ka cha-ka)
Rubber duckin, Jigga Jigga strip
Every name brand clothin off them T.J. Hookers
Watch how live gets, like a jungle so pack your survival kits, huh
Me and Redman been rollin for years
In the place wildlifin' doing Britney Spears

Chorus: Redman
You wanna ride...
Then get up get up get up get up get up get up (Okay)
Yo, you gettin drunk...
Then spit up spit up spit up spit up spit up spit up (Okay)
Yo, you gettin high...
Then smoke up smoke up smoke up smoke up smoke up smoke up (Okay)
Bitch, you wanna fuck...
Then push up push up push up push up push up push up (Okay)

[Redman]
Yo E stick a fork in 'em while I hit 'em again
Spit in the wind, biz with a dent on the end, I was high
T-U-V-W-X ask Why, you die with blood pourin out your da-da
You want the ri-ri-ri-ride from hardthorn, abide by your crew from a 735-i
Keep your town quiet like Biggie died
When I roll through cause crooked like Sticky eye
Def Squad nigga, fuck a big name
Bury my main shit, stain, and shit change
Switch game, Bam Ba Claud, Bon voyage
Blast your entourage like Flex blastin off
Jump on while I saddle the track
Bitch I throw dick where your adam apple is at
Style like cooked crack
Wiggle my feet, I shook Shaq with a cross over pass and look back
Yo, Brick City gorilla when I stomp
Earthquakes, hurricanes will build up until dusk
Throw fishin line to a chicken a reel it up
My crew gun clappers, half of 'em pilled up
Hit the club then I ?cornbread?
I bounce so hard from a drug I brought over the counter
Uptown, say what say what now?
Bustin my gun off for the millenium touchdown
When it does, I'm out in the Bricks gettin drunk
Nuttin in the bitch mouth and her tits

Chours

[Redman]
Yo, you wanna fuck, then push up push up

[Funkmaster Flex]
Alright, shot out to my boy Russell Simmons (Okay)
Big shot to Leo Cohens big shot to Kevin Niles (O-o-o-o-o-kay)
Big up my man Mike Cogesville
Its goin down baby one time
Fuck Flex, Big Kap
The tunnel nigga
Shots to my man Peter Gashin
Can't fuck with us
