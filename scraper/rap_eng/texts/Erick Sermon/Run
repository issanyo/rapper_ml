[Intro]
Yo, take the window lock off
It's crazy
Move the seat up a little bit
I feel ya, man
Where we goin'?
On a ride
That's all I need to know
Talk to 'em

[Verse 1]
It's a shame you don't treat me right
Then I stick by your side
Girl, my work is 9 to 5
To buy all the things that you like
'Cause you know it's real
And you know I gots this
So baby, what's the deal?
Why you showin' off in public?

So tell me why you playin' games
I'm a man, what you say?
Speak up, 'cause girl I can't hear you
Tired of gettin' 50 percent when I'm near you

[Pre-Chorus]
Like why I'm not givin' my all
When you act like you don't care at all
I guess I'm a sucker for love
But I believe in you, baby, so I never give up

[Chorus]
Every time I buy you things, you play the game
You run-run-run and you run-run
Can't you see my heart's in pain when you run away?
You run-run-run and you run-run
I'm so so sick of this "give me kiss" then you split
Tell me you care, but you keep me time limited
Girl, when you run (you run-run-run, you run-run)

[Verse 2]
So tell me what I'm supposed to do
When I can have any other, but girl, I want you
And tell me what I'm supposed to say
When I tell you I love you but you run away

So stop and turn around
And receive my lovin'
I pick you off the ground
Cloud 9, 'cause you deserve it
So many things I wanna do
But first I need to be with you
So I can make your dreams come true
But every time I try, you deny me, not cool

[Pre-Chorus]
Like why I'm not givin' my all
When you act like you don't care at all
I guess I'm a sucker for love
But I believe in you, baby, so I never give up

[Chorus]
Every time I buy you things, you play the game
You run-run-run and you run-run
Can't you see my heart's in pain when you run away?
You run-run-run and you run-run
I'm so so sick of this "give me kiss" then you split
Tell me you care, but you keep me time limited
Girl, when you run (you run-run-run, you run-run)

[Bridge Rap]
Yo, shawty, she the baddest
What you think, Mike Mann
She's thicker than your average, classic
Shawty mean, Joe Green the one
Every time I show her the good life, she run
Pull a mean town pretty black truck through the city
Red thigh-high boots, lookin' sexy and witty (ooh)
I'm on stage havin' fun with the boys in
No thoughts, I learned my lesson, man, from "Poison"
When I first saw her, I was hooked right there
She might not love me now, I gotta chase her, ain't fair
Sing to her all night, like "Can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me"
Felicia with the ass shots, that was just a post
Got the power, baby girl, had to run it like ghost
Take notes, I taste you, look how long it took me
Built the empire, Lucious-Cookie

[Chorus]
Every time I buy you things, you play the game
You run-run-run and you run-run
Can't you see my heart's in pain when you run away?
You run-run-run and you run-run
I'm so so sick of this "give me kiss" then you split
Tell me you care, but you keep me time limited
Girl, when you run (you run-run-run, you run-run)
