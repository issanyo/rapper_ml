C'mon, clap your hands, wind it up (x6)

Hush, I'm comin thru with the bum rush
Feelins forced style, Adidas, Cold Crush
What? My style's ridiculous
Who's gettin wit that spectaculous, miraculous?
Word to Lexus, I'm from New York
I'm flowin like Dom P so unpop the cork
Now feelin me for real do'
I'm the one who came from the back and blew the brains out of Al Pacino

Of lyricism, I'm on a Doug E.Fresh mission
Somebody stop me, I'm outta control please

Open em up, they hollow on the inside
No heart pumpin, their organ missin somethin

Wit the quickness, chump and have Jehovah Witness
Agony of defeat on the street
In front of your crew diggin, in front of your main chicken
Oooh, it's more than meet the eye, oh my god
Somebody got shook by a hardcore mirage
Speak on it, I get busy every week on it
DIE E-I, I sing and get unique on it
The miracle child, the chosen one

So lounge homeboy, you in the danger zone
I can't believe, I come with the mad degrees, boy
Freakin the funk with extra shit up the sleeve, uh

I maintain
I hold it down, so gimme that microphone
And lounge homeboy, you in the danger zone
When a brother like E is on the microphone, uh
I maintain, huh
I hold it down, so gimme that microphone
And lounge homeboy, you in the danger zone
When a brother like E-D is on the microphone, word
