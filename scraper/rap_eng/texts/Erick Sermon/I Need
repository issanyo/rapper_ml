[Hook: Voice]
I need a lady that'll hold it down and ride for me
I need a woman that'll let me be her everything
I need a girl official plus keep it real with me, chill with me, always on point when she deal with me (Repeat 1x)

[Verse 1: King Myers]
Not your typical female, not the type to complain for retail
I need the kind of chick where the beauty and brains prevail
She, enjoys spending her time wisely
So when I'm picking my poison, I'm avoiding ivy
That's the type that wanna spend up your bread
The type that give you head instead of breakfast in bed
The type that want the shoes just 'cause the bottom is red
But she got me twisted, gotta get out of the dreads, for real

[Hook: Voice]
I need a lady that'll hold it down and ride for me
I need a woman that'll let me be her everything
I need a girl official plus keep it real with me, chill with me, always on point when she deal with me (Repeat 1x)

[Verse 2: King Myers]
Since I'm the King, I need a Queen just to compliment
I need a chick that don't look at me as a scholarship
I'm your majesty, not your honor, ain't judging none of your problems
Need a Prima Donna just as much as daughters need fathers
I ain't Kevin Gates, ain't get tired I been tired
I need a Taraji to help build the Empire
The kind of chick that get hired, not get fired
But she gotta be a stand up chick like Miss Pryor

[Hook: Voice]
I need a lady that'll hold it down and ride for me
I need a woman that'll let me be her everything
I need a girl official plus keep it real with me, chill with me, always on point when she deal with me (Repeat 1x)

[Verse 3: Voice]
I need a girl that'll keep it up
Be on my sideline baby is you keepin up
Oh, I'll be your King, you be my Queen and stuff
I'll take you out five star, no Pizza Hut
No, I want you, hop out, miss you
Hop out then kiss you while you feel on my pistol
Hold you then grip you, you softer than tissue
No make up, no break ups, no fighting, no issues

[Hook: Voice]
I need a lady that'll hold it down and ride for me
I need a woman that'll let me be her everything
I need a girl official plus keep it real with me, chill with me, always on point when she deal with me (Repeat 1x)
