[Intro]
Know me I ran down on shorty real quick
But guess what she asked me, yo
Word?

[Verse 1]
She said Jay made you a millionaire and looked me in the eyes
Said cake, cake, cake got that from the pies
We made each other millions, that was my reply
But had a mill before I met him, baby, that ain't no lie
See he named some Harlem cats and the homie from the Chi
But my thing, he ain't name nobody from the Stuy
And I do it like Bed-Stuy, do or die
But lets talk about something else, you and I
She said cool, played the cool from far
My friends wanna ride if you cool with it, pa
It's all good we played pool at the bar
But I usually don't carpool, there's pools in the car, muah
She impressed by the lemon coupe
Life threw me lemon, I made lemon juice
Huh, from that I made lemonade
I kept the workers, sergeants and lieutenants paid
You messing with a nigga with mob ties
Plug me in girl, download my hard drive
In the bedroom might get hog tied
Dog fucked, aw shucks, welcome to our lives

[Interlude]
This what I told her though...

[Chorus]
Come and talk to me
I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you?
I really wanna know you
Come and talk to me
I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you?
I really wanna know you

[Verse 2]
Yo, she was intrigued by my repertoire
Heard I had niggas on water like the reservoir
Packs of crack, 9 mill in my dresser drawer
Heard I sold keys but made more off metaphors
Told her, her homework's efficient
Don't forget girl I get a lil' ig'nant (true)
And I Diddy bop like I tore a ligament
My whole persona, understand that you diggin' it
I know my life seems exquisite (true)
Know where I'm from, girl, you wanna take a visit?
We can spin up off my pivot, I don't talk it cause I live it
And the money in my pocket 'nough to stack up to a midget, girl...

[Chorus]
Come and talk to me
I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you?
I really wanna know you
Come and talk to me
I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you?
I really wanna know you
