[Erick Sermon]
The Bo$$, you suckers!

[Verse 1: Bo$$]
I'm comin' to getcha (yea)
Tonight when you sleep creeping steady but quick
I'm here to tell 'em, that B ain't no petty bitch
You run up, you're getting stuck - what was going through your mind
When you thought, over Bo$$, you could ever fuck? (you could EVER fuck)
So nut up, what's up is I'ma drop fat gun blast
In the gash in that ass if I find 'em I got 'em
Taking cover from the killin'
And body bags is the only motherfucking thing I'm fillin' (yea)
The spunk villain kill forty ounce by the neck
And it's kept on a ninety degree tilt
For me and my, diggy D-O-G's, doing dirt with ease
Should've got with that, niggas can't fuck wit deez (can't fuck wit deez)
Bitches straight pimpin'
Ain't no simps, and so the gang ain't simpin, it's a bitch thang
And step to this one how I figure
From six feet deep you push daisies and that ain't no maybe, nigga
So step in my set and get yo' ass fucked up when I hitcha
[How you comin'?] I'm comin' to getcha

[Chorus: Bo$$ & (Erick Sermon)]
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
(Yo, she's come to get ya, uh)
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
(Yo, she's come to get ya, kick it)

[Verse 2: Bo$$]
There they go, down the block, got the Glock cocked, here we come
Straight rolling in from the streets of the boondocks
Letting mo' than just a little go
Gunning punks down - then bailing back to the vehicle
Then that's when heads start swelling
You ain't been told; somebody better fucking tell 'em
Bout the motherfucking misfits, out on that other shit
Going all out, and doing much dirt on the killing tip (much dirt)
So save the rest for the next nigga
I was born to start trouble so they labelled me a gravedigger
And if the five-oh step, that's when I blast another
Twenty question asking punk cop motherfucker (yeah)
Don't make your move before you think
And fuck the judge, the jury and the god damn precinct
So you can see the total picture
Watch your back cause the fact is that Bo$$ is like comin' to getcha

[Chorus]
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha

[Erick Sermon]
Now check one two, E caught the flu
Funky with the style, some say I'm buck-wild
But step off and check out the Bo$$
You suckers and crab motherfuckers!
Yo, she's comin' to getcha

[Verse 3: Bo$$]
See most bitches don't fit
In the category of a criminal getting paid (yeah)
Where coming up is mandatory
Where nothing's falling but the motherfucking rain
And nothing's changed but the weather
Cause life in the ghetto still ain't getting no better
I'm taking a knot for a knot, throwing heavy hits
Then you wonder why it's yo' ass that I'm comin' to get
Cause what I got I simply took a crook that takes it to the limit
Life's already a bitch - without me in it
I commence to make dollars and sense, pump lead
Only evidence, another ditch another nigga dead
If you a homey cap peeled if you play homeys
Never stay homeys long anyway, fuck it
See some be throwing for bullshit, that must mean on some night
I'll take yo' ass out with just one shot
So when you duck from the bullets I won't give a fuck
You should've died before they hitcha, I'm comin to getcha

[Chorus]
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
