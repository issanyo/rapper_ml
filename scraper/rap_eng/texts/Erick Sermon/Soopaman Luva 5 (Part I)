Somebody stole my mojo!

[Verse 1]
Yo, once again..
Soopaman Luva flying through the fuckin sky
I'm lookin for my mojo, I'm fried chinky-eyed
My cape is still tore up, but I make a lil' money
I'm like Ace Ventura, duckin my landlord
The land of the poor, where I handle my biz
I got a weed spot on the block Hannibal live
Pokemon on the pipe, Rudolph the deer Red-Nose
Glow in the night, when his nose gettin right
I pimp Snow and Vanna White on the ho stroll
Dr. Ruth on E, sippin Old Gold
Mr. T on crack, mohawk cornrow
In South Park with the Chef, in the stolen Ford
"I'm lookin for my mojo, where it at?
Got a APB on it dawg, where it at?"
I ran into Cita, from BET
She said, "Man is a nigga, that's fast on the trigger
I thought he was you, when we had the party for two
My girlfriend said the same, majority rules"
"Damn!! Who takin my women?
Who takin my chickens around Thanksgiving? Now that's pimpin!"
Called my man Meth and Bishop Don Juan
He smokin a blunt, other sippin Chandon
He said it ain't the game, but how you play it
So I can't hate the game, so I'm dyin to play it
Now I'm back in the air, ready to put my smack down
I'm searchin for the impostor to pat down
I'm urgin to put the Glock up and clap rounds
It's curtains like Jimmy Hoffa, he not found
So ride on me, try homie
Your plan'll fail like the Acme Kit from Coyote
Now I'mma find the bastard that stole my juice
Soopaman Part Five, in your archives

[Singers]
I'm yo Soopaman baby, that's who I am
Flyin through the air, without a care
I'm high as hell blazin, that Cali weed (Kryptonite for life)
That Kryptonite bud, that sticky green
I'm yo' Soopaman (he's yo' Soopaman) I'm yo' Soopaman
I'm yo' Soopaman (whoaaa yea yea yea yea) I'm yo' Soopaman
I'm yo' Soopaman (he's high as hell for life)
I'm yo' Soopaman (that Cali weed)
I'm yo' Soopaman (Kryptonite baller)
I'm yo' Soopaman (sticky green)
