[Intro]
"Okay 1, 2, 3 FUCK LISA!"


[Verse 1: R.ichard Oasis]
As I prove I'm smoove like lube when you in the nude I glue the flu symptoms to the simp ones sent them
New blues clues to view the cause of falls of all rappers tombs
I coon on yal tubes yal Fool(full) like moons if Ya surprised ya eyes lied applied
The cold more soul than size twenty two shoes lose it with that, whose this nigga R.ichard I picked up a uzi
So of course ima use it, niggas be on bullshit full clip when I pull the tool from my lyrical duel mule drool pool pit
Flow like molten lava you hoping you get it hotter why the niggas think its sweet like condos i suppose
Get ya baby to jump like hopscotch in Osh Kosh B Gosh, clothes, I goes in with the pen im cold than
Scorpion brother this flow from my hands leave you frozen brother, other, rappers wrapped up in fetuses this heat I spit
Leave they flow evaporated made in a guilt built by mobsters corrupt coppers where they'll leave ya stomach open
See food like lobsters, physical like doctors, appointments, flow sharp as a point gets, the point is
Im on point like indexes searching for Steve Francis advances that need answers emmance from these antics
Chances with semantics kill beats right away like pedestrians

[Hook]
Where the weed at?
But I need that
Where the weed I mean I really need that
And where the weed at?
But I need that
But I mean the weed I really need that X2
Dada dan naa nana nan naaaaaaa




[Verse 2: R.ichard Oasis]
Im that Deja Vu moment from ya past life you asked twice
To prove oh as is nice thief's theme, steal her tonight give her act right
When I light up my shine I smoke the mic like a crack pipe
Im that nice, flow powerful as politics and religion gets
Incision efficient sentences for ya senses is
My distance from distant, ignorant individuals interval interludes that enter you
In a due, time you'll find my rhymes sublime im minding mine remind you im
Lyrically the epitome of Jordan mixed with water you can't hold my flow like so
You better exit a vessel or embezzle the presence of
My team is fiends need the cream like eczema
Eggs in a, basket fast livin' to casket endings
And its, over for ya, a ransom event for ya anthem attempts
Cuz my flow intense like flooded camping events let me vent
These measly acid passages with easy access mass is ecclesiastics ratchets with greasy absence
I pass the matches to pastors who flash the cash for asses
That's thick as molasess, get live!

[Hook]


[Verse 3: R.ichard Oasis]
"Woah yo nigga hold on let us know R.ich O got the best flow"

Relax when asking, whos the next best, its the reckless ambidextrous
Test this, I flex techs in 3 seconds, sections you left in
When these bars hit you, situations you faced wit, evasive
Success and excessive suck sex, in secs the time it takes for me to wreck the track
While I bless the rest, invest in a vest and protect ya neck
Or get ya, eye swole size of pot holes Picassa Caso how yo
Face gon' look out yo, frame same thangs can't explain the pain
I bring to lames veins inflamed from these, crack bars at loss
Of knee caps off and toss ya thoughts thinking you can run with son ya done..

[Hook]
