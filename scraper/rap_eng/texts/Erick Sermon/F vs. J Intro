[Intro]
At night, I lie awake and this man is...is burning
Every waking moment, he haunts me
I think he’s coming
I know he’s coming
I see someone else...in the fog...by the lake
And he’s holding something...
Who is he?

(Ted Smooth, straight face, you remember!)

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yeah, it’s gettin' spooky out here
All the Nino Browns done turned Pookie out here
No cool niggas, it’s just goofies out here
I mean, niggas is eating pork wearing kufis out here
Through it all, stood tall, Doofy out here
Ten toes down, I’m on two feet out here
Truthfully, out here, I’ll be too flee out here
Getting fly, no bullshit, I’m the 2-3 out here
From Jordans you ain’t see, shoutout to Carolina
To all baby me’s, I see all you Harold Miners
Mixtape three-peats, I fadeaway at the go-go
With girls that’ll spread they legs open for a logo, ay
Check out the swag, yo, I walk like a ball player
To the locker room, I’m back to cock it to ‘em
Toast to all you niggas that was talkin’ caca to ‘em
We on a different FLŌH, we ain’t sendin’ vodka to ‘em
The shots that we giving make you send a doctor to ‘em
Bet he say ‘aah’ when it blocka-blocka to ‘em
Now he in a awkward room tryna lock a goon
Like the shooter had a hood on, mighta been Dr. Doom
Sounded like a fifth or a nine, couldn’t tell though
All a sudden, thunder, it mighta been Hoodie Melo
You soft as pudding Jell-O, we’ll come to your hood and "Hello"
Wave it at everybody, ain’t tryna be put in jail though
All I know is that the Lambo look good in yellow
And I be swervin' potholes in every hood and ghetto
Lame nigga, swerve, I lame nigga swerve
It’s been 10 years and you the same nigga, swerve!
I just gotta keep on keepin' on
But I’m not gon’ be the one you keep on sleepin' on
This verse right here be your worst nightmare
I just laugh at you niggas then come after you niggas
Freddy!

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
HA-HAAAEEH! (You remember!)
I’m dead wrong; you wanna live, I can’t let you
You at full speed, I’m walking, I still catch you
Mr. Voorhees, good looking, I destroy these
These niggas ain’t bosses, they workers and employees
I came out of the lake, but I be in the boondocks
Flannel or overall, work boots, tube socks
I’ll put something right through your face from out the toolbox
Niggas get hot and make the news, I make the news hot
You can be as hard as whoever, I crack craniums
You know all my killings are brutal and spontaneous
I like this, pop out, soon as you hit the light switch
Run and then all a sudden you fall like the white chicks
Might have to crush your Adam’s apple with the vice grips
You never see me during the day, I play the night shift
Cartilage, flesh and bone, damp gristle
Be my guest, go ahead and hide, I can’t miss you
You already know I reside at Camp Crystal
Lake, dismantle your face, revamp tissue
Power from the hockey mask, James St. Patrick
Three bodies in one night, that’s a hat trick
Pay the plug soon as you finish, that’s a backflip
Spend six, make 12 back, that’s a crack flip
Sad part about it, you boys ain’t even ready
Preferably my weapon of choice is the machete
Screaming at the top of your lungs before I mangle you
Zip you up in your sleeping bag before I strangle you
Yeah, I had it in me since a youngin’
When you hear that (Kill kill kill), you don’t see me but I’m comin'
Everybody gotta die, every man, every woman
(Kill kill kill) Yeah, it ain’t even no sense in runnin'
(Kill kill kill) Nah, my name ring around the nation
How the crime scene was left, they could tell that it was Jason
