Intro:

Aiyyo-yo-yo-yo you better pass it
Aiyyo check this out
We coming to you live from that BOMB Chocolate City my man
Where the knotty-headed niggas and the Brick City brigade dwell
And if you don't know your fool better ask
Aiyyo-yo you better pass that blunt
And yo E, we comin to you live with the Cosmic type stuff

Verse One: Redman
Well it's that brother coming six billion feet from beneath
And you should be peep-in how I get smoked-out on the weekend
I swing it to my crew or down to my fans
Schoolin hell of stackas like final exams
Cause, it's the Funkadelic, hit you with the irrelevant
Elements, and it's coming through your block
Can't you smell it trick?
Wanna copy-cat my whole format
So you get funk tracks, punch lines and skull hats
Hoooo! Got a little Redman in town
Who's that effin clown soundin wack with the frown??
I don't know man, but you better wonder what I would do
While loud on this staff like birds one and two
My crew runs thicka than syrup from the burrow
You get hurt up, word up, Jam-med like Pearl
Knock off from blood clot puff on the rough block
Or I peep my man, Rockafella, it don't stop

Chorus:
On and on, and it don't quit
Redman rockin on to the funky shit, c'mon
On and on, and it don't quit
Redman rockin on to the funky shit
I said Jersey's in the house Jersey's in the house
I said Brooklyn's in the house Brooklyn's in the house
I said Uptown's in the house Uptown's in the house
I said the Bronx in the hidouse The Bronx in the hidouse

Verse Two:
Newark, New Jersey, rock rock on, word is bond
I'm comin in swarms, so turn your flashlights on
Due to dificulty, my style flows while it tracrossed the planet
In 48 Hours like Nick Nolte
Droppin the flavor, stay Sky high like Pager
I'm magical like Fantasia on paper
I Saw the Light like Kraftwerk, of course
When the T-L-A Rock shock the stuff, It's Yours!
To your drawers, your record label got your staff gassed
Thinkin you gonna sell two mil cakes real fast
But you're blocked, and your earrings choke like a tec
Now, who freakin style your ass gonna steal next?
Are there any more imitators in the house?? There are no
Bust like NBA Jams, and you can have Chicago
Catch the cargo, funky like a bag of Bravos
Way back, with a pump 92 K-T-U in car loads
Huuh! I just stay funky like that
Make you wanna (sssss) my style like a junkie on crack
Trick, you better back the freak up, for real now
When I break it down from Newark NJ to IllTown

Chorus:
On and on, and it don't quit
Redman rockin on to the funky shit, c'mon
On and on, and it don't quit
Redman rockin on to the funky shit
I said Virginia's in the house Virginia's in the house
I said Cali's in the house Cali's in the house
I said Atlanta's in the house Atlanta's in the house
North Carolina's in the house Carolina's in the house

Verse Three:
Yoo-hoo watch the birdie!! While Red wreck your brains early
If rap was B-Ball, I'd have assists like James Worthy
Dribble the rock if you got the hots to get your knot rocked
Twice my device, Run-D.MC's from my Rock Box
Hey you, better Come Clean like Jeru
Before I take phase two and do another pay-per-view
To your crew, I give a boom bip to Q-tip
Standin tall like Shaq, honey I'm back, this ain't Blue Chips
The new stuff, creamin brothas like Breyer's
He's heating up -- nah, brotha, I'm on fire!
Dribble dribble shootin three pointers to the drum trick
Try to take my style, BLAOW, end one
DJ Twinz in the house for the nine-square
My man Shaft, you don't know you better ask

Outro:

That bomb Chocolate City coming to you live
From the ninety-fo' era
Aiyyo you better pass that blunt, aiyyo check this out
We gonna take it to you live
Where Newark New Jersey drops that chocolate funk for ya
Everyday and all day, how we do it word is bond, word is day
Def Squad's in the house for the nine-fo', word is bond, word is day
The sad Hawthorne Ave. got the good smoke, word is bond, word is day
Knotty-head niggas in the house for nine-fo', word is bond, word is day
