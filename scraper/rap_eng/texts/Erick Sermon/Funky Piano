(Chuck D sample: "Hear my jam with the funky piano") [scratched 4x]

Straight from Brooklyn, from out the projects
It's DJ Scratch, so girls fix your Kotex
The Ruler; not Slick Rick, but the ruler on the mix
With ten or more tricks
Take flicks, prick, but please don't miss this:
Watch my DJ cut with his dick
Yeah, slick ain't it? See your moms fainted
Technics 1200, and watch scratch train it
I'm-a step off and let Scratch collect dough
While you hear my jam with the funky piano

("Hear my jam with the funky piano") [scratched 4x]
("Here with the movement of his hands")

("Who is the best?") [scratch] ("Me!") [scratch]
("Stop lying") ("Go ask her mother") {all 4x}
[Scratch]

PMD:
A brief description, yeah, bust my DJ on the mix
No line switch, two transform, cuts wit his lips
And feeds up and down is extra weak
He strictly cross-fades club mixes every week
Won't break a sweat, the man's sharp on the blade
Real name George Spivey, sports a high-top fade
Brothers starin' shocked while the brother is rockin'
No arrows on the record or marks, or needle poppin'
From table to table, sports a Gucci cable
EPMD's the group, Def Jam is the label
Now I'm-a step off while Scratch collects his dough
Or rock a funky scratch to the funky piano

("Hear my jam with the funky piano") [scratched 4x]
("Here with the movement of his hands")

("Who is the best?") [scratch] ("Me!") [scratch]
("Stop lying") ("Go ask her mother") {all 4x}
[Scratching]
("Good God!")
