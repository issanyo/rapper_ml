Yo this is Keith Murray and Hurricane G with the bom bom zee
Trey deep takin to the streets
We straight ball hoggin, word up
Niggas know what time it is
Straight up
Straight motherfuckin Def Squad, L.O.D

We can stand in the water and can't get wet
Def Squad always got some fly shit on deck

[Paul Hightower] Gl-or-ia!!

[Hurricane G]
Hey fun-ny, what's up with that money grip, yeahhh
Get hip to my tune and yo watch me flip
The master, the ultimate funk, freak-er
I'm unique, I got soul out my sneak-er
A dope female, with the fat tail
I never liked college, so yo, fuck Yale!
If you don't know me by now I'm Puerto Rican
(When the track be creepin she be freakin when she speakin!)
The Bad Mamma Jama, still bust the grammar
Fuck the bullshit, let's get legit
Yes me the Hurricane yo I pack skills
So I keep on steppin like I'm doin drills
Hut one, two, charge enlarge
God damn, so don't fuck around with the jam!
Sit back, relax, niggas and watch me kick it
Don't flex, in my pocketbook I pack a biscuit
I blow your ass out (click click BOOYAKA)
How's that?  Now peep the size of my gat
I'm gassed, so motherfuckers kiss my ass
My whole ass; my entire big fat ol' ass!

[Keith Murray]
Keith Murray run this motherfucker!  (Hell motherfuckin yeah!)
Keith Murray run this motherfucker!  (Hell motherfuckin yeah!)

[Paul Hightower] Ke-ii-thhh!!!

[Keith Murray]
The mad matador metaphoric mergers like traffic *car tires squeal*
Not havin it, bashin your style I'm somethin drastic
Biblically, theoretically, practically speaklin who
Wanna step in the helm of the realm of the Def Squad crew (Def Squad!!)
I shoot the gift like SWISH drinkin Olde English
Nigga you wish you had the style, more distinguished than this
Pissed ain't the word so observe -- how I break
Your flow down through science, and kick you to the curb
Firsthand dirt and jungle poetry
You see me, G, we or E and somethin out this anatomy
Found the words of motherfuckin technology
(like that) and we out

[Paul Hightower]
It's the bom bom zee, ohhh yeah
With Keith Murray, and Hurricane G...
For y'all that don't know -- ya betta ask somebody!
