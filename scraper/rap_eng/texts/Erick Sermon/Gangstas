[Jody Breeze]
From the A all the way to Compton
They say the new N-W-A is comin'
Keep your basses bumpin'
Stay away from who fake & frontin'
Try and play me, I'mma take your face to thumpin'
I'm a gangsta, I don't need rap for nothin'
And only play games in the A or Compton
Hop by the box chevy murder any man standin'
Its more than the hood, E, tell 'em where its standin'

[Eazy-E]
I got beat for the street to tha beach I'll be rolling
Neva see me strolling, 40s I'll be holding
Girls in the daisies drive Eazy crazy
Rolled up my windows as I turned on my A-C
Rolling down Crenshaw see tha hoes jocking
Sunday nights popping, see tha foes hopping
My stereo's bumpin' that A-T-L funk
You can call it what ya want, either way that shit bumps

[Hook]
[Eazy-E]
Being a gangsta is so neat, yeah

[Young Jeezy]
Them boyz in the hood will keep your heart
Come talkin' that trash and we'll pull your car

[Young Jeezy]
I'm in the 6-4 5th, bitch strapped, no roof
The Snowman pimp, bitch shoes on the coupe
Stepped in 100 deep, deep, blew a few bucks
G'd up a pair of black strings in the chucks
My wrist so rocky and my neck so bright
My stones change colors like a disco light
Whole team strapped up, let a nigga trip
Desert Eagle in the club, better, nigga flip

[Duke]
From the south to west, I stay in a vest
Fully loaded, Smif 'N' Wess to protect my nest
Let you trip, you disrespect, you get checked
More direct, you end up with a hole in your neck
I must confess there's got to be somethin' in the water
Cause every year I age, I gets harder and harder
Got a team of cutthroats, niggas with hood hoes
Tryin to cope slum dough, whenever the guns blow

For all the J's I got thanks for you
If crime pays, we looking for a gangsta lean
You bad niggas better tang your lip
You gon fuck around and get in some gangsta shit

[Big Gee]
All black boys with them toys four deep
Tote heat, four speed, grow tree, in a [?] suite
So, niggas don't want beef
Nigga run up on the corner, match a barrel through his teeth
Four foot shallow grave, Fifth all kinda ways
Oh he ain't gotta say he think he gonna get away

The punk went that-a-way, The punk went that-a-way
