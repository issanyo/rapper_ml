[Verse 1: Mone]
Hands to the ceiling, yeah, we come to do work
Don't nobody move and nobody getting murked
Wrist covered in jewels, timepiece a small work
Diamonds screaming, "Hallelujah," watch cost a small church
Get it how we live it
Spend it like we print it
Everything be tinted
We buy it, you niggas rent it
No, don't be offended, I give you niggas the business
Giving you bitches stitches, you would think I was a dentist
They label me a menace, A-Wax
Homie, you need that white, Ajax
We move em by the squares, eight-tracks
Swag on a mil, name even to the max
Racks on racks, yeah we all about that action
Bunch of bald yellowbone bitches, Toni Braxton
Take a hard hit to the face, Meeka Claxton
Your bitch up on my stick, when I hit I'm Reggie Jackson

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
We gonna get it popping in this motherfucker, get it popping
We gon set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
Hands in the air in this motherfucker, hands up
We don't really care in this motherfucker, don't care
Get your drinks up in this motherfucker, drinks up
Smoke that good shit in this motherfucker, smoke something
Get all that cake in this motherfucker, get money
Ain't nobody hating in this motherfucker, show love

[Verse 2: Erick Sermon]
Yes sir, I feel great and
Even if there's hate in the air, I'm still straight and
Even those saying we dead is my sake
It's the apple, this balloon won't deflate
Nah, not while I'm present
When you hear the E with Godson and Vic
It come out fly, whoever says it
And that's why I stay so Polo'd down, yup
My guns be the newest, my jeans be the bluest
Got bread like I'm Jewish, address me as mister
Chicks gather around like it's a Bar Mitzvah
Calling me daddy but I ain't Twista
Calling me poppa but I ain't Christopher
You checking out one of God's bestest
Something closer to justice, I'm bigger than Precious
History, boy, up in the making
If there's something left in the rap game, homie, we taking

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fred The Godson]
I put the work out, Tae Bo
Hop out the Tahoe
They lost boys, still hype, Freaky Tah flow
Yeah, I know -- you getting money, you happy
Nigga, when you triple your work, then you get at me
They slipping on they pimping, I got the shottie, I'm limping
Hit eighteen no limit, you'll get it if you just listen
Like they gon' pay ten, I'm Sean pimping when I'm whipping
Gary Peyton; ten k? Sorry, Erick, I'll just keep spitting
I'm the best by far, they gotta keep their flow tighter
I hit the club, buy the bar -- no ghostwriter
Hit up the ma's dance floor, hold her close, tighter
And by tomorrow, wake up with no clothes by her
I'm so Fat Boy fresh
With that rap, boy -- you know that boy best
Swizzy on the beat, Erick Sermon a legend
Fred and Vico the future, what a weapon

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Swizz Beatz]
I'm chilling in my Aston Martin with four doors
The top off, I feel like that bitch fell off
Niggas acting sick, well I make you niggas cough
Plus I'm riding clean, bitch -- I got them white walls
I'm chilling on a yacht with that billion dollar talk
That billion dollar walk, I got that billion dollar spark
I come from that gritty city up the New York
You niggas talking crazy, bet you niggas won't jump
But your money where your mouth is
Put your house or put your keys
I'm in this fucking game
And I do this shit for real
Two hundred and fifty million sold track record
You niggas talking crazy, you ain't got a hot record
Fresh
