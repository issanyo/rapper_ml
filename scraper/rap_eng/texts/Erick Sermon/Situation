Cruisin', Low altitude my destination
As the beat crawls im bumpin' Biggie Smalls
Loungin' gettin' high off the sticky
I'm reminiscing of last night's quickie
I feel the urge to bust a rhyme so i do it
I say a few raps then my boys jump into it
Now the vibe is felt throughout the car
The smoke (?) so i crack the window
As the smoke goes to clear from being hectic
Just in time for me to get off the fuckin' exit
I get off make a right go down 6 flights then in sight its the hype
Now I'm creeping turned off my lights and drove through the parking lot looking for a spot
Hey in front its the valet
Yo he's cool ya'll niggas stash the tools
I grabbed the ticket put it in my pocket
People recognize me now I'm getting props kid
From the side Def Squad's representing
Something wasn't right the vibe wasn't clicking
I told my crew wassup wassup yo lets be ghost alright
Man fuck this night tonight
As I walked out this girl ran up me with a fat ass
And a pair of old Jordache
She said she met me last year at Howard's homecoming
I acted like i knew but I was only fronting

{Chorus}
My situation just a situation its a fucking situation
My situation just a situation its a fucking situation

{Verse 2}

Not caring, I said lets go outside right now
I can't hear you because the music's too loud
I stepped out slipped the valet the ticket
Then stepped like a G to the girl i was talking to and kicked it
Saying this and that (blah blah)
Before this high take me under lemme get your phone number
On my way to the car
I heard somebody screamin out "Yo bitch where you are?"
Out came this mean, upset type nigga
And behind his black ass someone bigga
He calls out the girl im with name yall i was fucked
She turns around and say "what?"
Shit's thick he comes over with the grill
Ready to stomp the bitch but i say chill
He fronts like he wants it no doubt
Right about this time the whole club is letting out
Now he gets louder and makes a scene, saying "what u want nigga"
I'm thinking about my Glock trigga
But it's under my seat i can't reach
Im assed out now i gotta take it to the streets
He yells out some type of codename and everyone gathers around
We're about to get down
All in my face making crazy noise
Hype as hell showing out in front of his fuckin homeboys
"Fuck that nigga he ain't shit!"
A voice from the Def Squad represents the click
Now somebody from his crew and my crew are making ruckus
Two rowdy muthafuckas
Darkness covers the whole atmosphere
Saying to myself "I knew i shouldn't have came here"
Shots rang out bang bang out slang slang out
Damn so i pulled my thang out
Pow! I see blood hit my coat
I didn't feel hit so i didn't choke
The girl dropped she got shot
Two to the headpiece B and she died instantly
Over nothing because her man was fronting
Acting like he wanted something but didn't want nothing
Now i see things clear
Saying to myself "Damn i knew i shouldn't have came here"

{Chorus 4x}
And I'm out
