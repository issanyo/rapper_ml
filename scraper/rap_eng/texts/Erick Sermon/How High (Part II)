[Intro: Redman + Method Man]
Yo, ladies and gentlemen
We got Toni Braxton up in the house
So high that I can kiss the sky, bitch
We live up in here, y'all; let's get high!
Motherfucker, get high!

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Tical shittin' again, spittin' to win
Loaded guns, clip in the end, none sicker than him
Yes, indeed, I'm ill as any STD's or sex disease
These dirty rats want extra cheese
On that piece of the pie
Now ask me "How high?", I'll tell you "Reach for the sky!"
Blame the Crooked Letter I
That's my home, 23's wrapped in chrome
Not only snap on y'all niggas but I'll snap them bones
Clap your dome, make you leave that crack alone
You got the key to the city but the latch is on?
I gots it locked, bringin' the noise, bringin' the Funk
Doctor Spock, bringin' my boys, bringin' you lungs
Pop the Glock, but only if you feel this shit
Jack the Ripper; don't make me have to kill this bitch!
Back to get ya, put it in check, that's the Mista
Meth with his wood on your neck, shut your lips up

[Hook: Toni Braxton + Method Man & Redman]
I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get

[Verse 2: Redman]
You can call on the man when the party is borin'
I'll have these hoes strippin' till it's part of the mornin'
I love a fat chick with a body enormous
It ain't about the weight, yo, it's how they performin'
My dash is 180, my weed half a pound
When the smoke in the air my nose like basset hounds
I don't stash the 'dro, nigga, divide
I'm that nigga that ride with trigger to give a supply
High is how I stay all the time
(Method Man: Niggas, close your doors!)
Yo, bitches, shut all your blinds!
If I'm hard to find, take two puffs and pass
I stay back, but my Benz moved up a class
It's Doc and Meth, the format is real sickenin'
Contagious, we out for Mr. Biggs' women
You better shut your trap when my dogs around
We pissin' on fire hydrants, so walk around, bitch!

[Hook: Toni Braxton + Method Man & Redman]
I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Mista Method Man, puttin' in work, foot in the dirt
Like it's all good, roll through your hood, pushin' a hearse
I wish y'all would come around like Clint Eastwood
As if you're reppin' your hood in my neck of the woods
Street gorillas in the PJ's, grimy bitch
I wear the same shit for three days, find me lit
Blunt sparks, like Phillippi; fuck the he-say, the she-say!
Adjust the microphone, plus the cliché

[Verse 4: Redman]
Yo, call me the Bob Backlund
I'll break backs on hoes that look like Toni Braxton
Come run with these boney masked men
I'm out the gutter, I'm out to send your baby mother
Out for rubbers; we fuckin' tonight
Bitches wanna crowd around, how I'm cuffin' the mic
I'm a gorilla, leave a banana stuck in your pipe
‘Cause I'm a real block winner, the Doc inna
Bitch, one of my balls bigger than the Epcot Center!

[Hook: Toni Braxton + Method Man & Redman]
I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get
