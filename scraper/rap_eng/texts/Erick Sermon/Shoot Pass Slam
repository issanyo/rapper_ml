[Produced by Erick Sermon]

[Album intro: Ken Dawg]
Word 'em up
Ken Dawg and Shaq Attack in the house for the nine tre, nine quad
Yo, we from Newark so you know we representin'
Yo, E, bring it in!

[Video intro: Shaquille O'Neal]
"Shoot Pass Slam" by Shaquille O'Neal

[Refrain]
Do you want me to shoot it?
(No!)
Do you want me to pass it?
(No!)
Do you want me to slam?
(Slam!)
Get out the way
Get out the way
Get out the way now!

[Verse 1: Shaquille O'Neal and Ken Dawg]
Yo, yo, it's the Ken Dawg
What about the Shaq Attack?
Where's our hook, black?
Yo, yo, we don't need that
Now it's time for me to get wide open
I start smoking, I am no joke, the Shaq has spoken
I dominate my competition
And bust them with the ammunition
And chew my old opposition
A mad brother from the dunk planet
Who controls it? Not Janet, you better can it
You better believe I'm coming hardcore for the cause
You better pause before I bust a hole in yours
The Shaq-a-tocious, the tall human being
You catch Shaq and Ken Dawg in the colosseum
You better make way and stop 'cause I'm hostile
I get hype like church choirs singing gospel
Pass the ball or the mic, whatever suit ya
Give it away, give it away now, before I boot ya
Shaq Attack laying low key so don't knock me
Or try to stop me, I got skills like Mr. Miyagi
I wax on and stay on, so back up
I roll with the Dunk Mob
I'm a rookie, Clint Eastwood, Martin Sheen (Ahhh!)
Leave me alone, I'm turning green
When I get green, I get cock diesel
Then I piggity-piggity-piggity-piggity-piggity-pop goes the weasel
My, my, my, Shaq can kick it
Ask Ice Cube; O'Shea Jackson, am I wicked?
Wicked, rugged, I can score a bucket
Bases loaded, knock it out the park like Kirby Puckett
A-tisket, a-tasket, I rip down a basket
(Yo, Shaq, can you rock the mic?)
How can you ask it?
I flow like a stream, better yet, a river
You need to call me "Mailman" since Karl can't deliver rhymes like I can
Hit you with my Shaq Attack and backhand to Thailand
Women call me "Rackman"
Coast to coast, L.A. to Chicago
I'm strong and cocky like Ivan Drago
I hop-hop, hip-hip
Check out the way I rip-rip
Upset to your stomach, plop-plop, pip-pip
Sharp as a dagger, call me Shaq Attacker
I love Jim Valvano, forget Jimmy Swaggart
I'm a mack, you better back off me
I left a bad taste in your mouth, like boogers and toffee

[Refrain]
Do you want me to shoot it?
(No!)
Do you want me to pass it?
(No!)
Do you want me to slam?
(Yeah!)
Get out the way
Get out the way
Get out the way now!

[Verse 2: Shaquille O'Neal]
Ali, Ali, Ali, boma
Go tell your pops and your momma
That Shaq is the man, period, comma
Mark of salutation, here's my next quote
I'ma kick it like primates, sike, nope
I'm a Sermon like Erick, a Coleman like Derrick
Supercalifragilistic, Shaq is not generic
I'm half-man, half-child, you know the rumor
(They say, "You couldn't rap, Shaq!")
Why did they assume-a?
I could flow like water coming out a faucet
But if you've got a basketball, E, won't you toss it off the glass
Watch me dunk on they ass
I [?] (Word, goddamn!)
You see this is fact not fictionary
Do me a favor, look up "Shaq" in the dictionary
I'm sure you'll see a picture of me, brother
I love Lucille Harrison (Who's that, Shaq?)
That's my mother

[Refrain]
Shoot it?
(No!)
Do you want me to pass it?
(No!)
Do you want me to slam it?
(Yeah!)
Get out the way
Get out the way
Get out the way now!
Do you want me to shoot it?
(No!)
Do you want me to pass it?
(No!)
Do you want me to slam?
(Yeah!)
Get out the way
Get out the way
Get out the way now!
