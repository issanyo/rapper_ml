[Intro: Sample from Kevin Hart]
Have you ever seen a woman go from frantic to calm?

[Erick Sermon]
Don't ever snap on me what? Over forty nigga! what!

[Verse One: Erick Sermon]
Yep! I'm like go team Erick
I was born with dopeness just swag you inherit (Uh Huh!)
Kids! This is why I'm hot
Playboy approach me wrong, this is why I shot
Huh! Ball! I get the game from my pop
'Til everyone know my name the game don't stop
Now! Not! So I keep pumpin the block
Until I'm big as Rihanna and Mason's rock
While you love Sosa

Her ass alone man bigger than Oprah
Puerto Rican, Dominican first name Rosa
Anyway, let me explain one time

[Verse Two: Snoop Dogg]
My money bigger than homie you funny niggas is phony
Tony told me he showed me so I gotta get mine
Let me just slip into the back of the wide
Open your eyes let your window down now you in the passenger side
Get in, now you get it, quit it and with it
Waan come test me now tell 'em the Lion did it
And bit 'em off a chip of the block of the wood
Lil' homie couldn't rock if he could click cockin and pull
Hip hopin over lot of the bull more pull
And yes, I am paid and full
Fa schizzay, my nizzay, Erick D-i-iznay!
That's all I'm a sizznay, okizzay
'Cause I'm too mean too cool too cold too slick
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick
That nigga Snoop about to take yo' bitch
With no hesitation or explanation
Pimp!

[Erick Sermon & RL]
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!

[Verse Three: Method Man]
Yo! Like a room full of black of raw heat
They see the flow back gettin all geek, It's like I'm Pete Charles I'm all street
They come in time money but talk cheap
But rappers wanna kick it I'm all feet
Every line artistic that's all me, my man's son autistic that's so key
The why go and get it I'm so G
That's why I wear the fitted so low key, that's why I kill the critic for no fee
Then tell the judge I did it and go free
E double E my co-d
Let's throw the book at 'em what's yo' plea?
Guilty as charged that's how it is when your guilty and charged
Took a bunch of Def, artist and built me a Squad
What's today's math? Build with the God, weed, women and cars
Lock the game down I'm givin 'em bars
What is life if you ain't livin it large? If you ain't livin it large
Go get the price checked and get you a job
But wait

[Chorus: RL] (Sample from Kevin Hart)
Hey! Hey! Let me explain this
Hey! Hey! Let me explain this
Hey! Hey! (SAY IT WITH YOUR CHEST!)
(LIL' ASS NIGGA! SAY IT WITH YOUR CHEST!)

[Erick Sermon & RL]
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!

[Outro: RL]
Yeah!
