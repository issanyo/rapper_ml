[Redman]
I am hip-hop: look through the lens
My fitted cap got the gold sticker on the brim
I look like an 8, but I flow like a 10
The New Jack that got G Money on the stem
I started in '92, back in the 2G
4 docks with Jamal How High: The Movie
Got new money, got new clothes
Got with Superbad, I'mma get that fo sho
Fo sho, I'mma get that fo sho, I got it
I crank up the base and it cause power outage
Master my paper, I been bout it bout it
Graduated from the streets and dropped out of college
Bitch, give me knowledge, fuck study hall
You could say I got my PhD in the car
A hood nigga, drink out peanut butter jars
Red and Meth, rocking the bells like Todd

[Hook: Erick Sermon & Redman]
LET’S GO! let’s go let’s go LET’S GO!

This shit pumps like a body in the trunk (LOOK!)

Yo! I’m like Selleck with the magnum, without the P.I
This grown folk B.I. llama tucked in my Levi’s
This Killa Bee, keep a honey bee in the bee hive
The type that beat the seeds and bring you weed on B.I
I’m on that Grand Hustle my dude shoutout to T.I
The dope I’m tryna hustle is compliments of the green eye
E, let me bark on these youngins get in they heads
I was gettin pissy drunk when they still was pissin the bed
I can see why, they envy the swag ’cause Staten Island we
Empty the mag you wave an enemy flag around here
I got somethin to say, gimme the floor
Matter fact, Doc let’s cut to the chase, give me the swords
Time to Leatherface the game got niggas sayin my name
‘Til it taste like, shit in your mouth son, my goons snatch chains
Slap the shit out your dame clap them thangs
Blow these niggas out they frame and we out, ONE!

[Hook: Erick Sermon & Redman]
LET’S GO! let’s go let’s go LET’S GO!
Let’s go let’s go LET’S GO!
You can hear what he’s sayin homey he said LET’S GO!
Ok we ain’t playin man I said LET’S GO!

[Method Man]
This shit pumps like a body in the trunk (LOOK!)
This shit pumps like a body in the trunk (LOOK!)
This shit pumps like a body in the trunk (LOOK!)
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

[Verse 3: Erick Sermon]
Uh! Mike was the king of pop, I’m dangerous
I shoot the Glock but I prefer the stainless
I ain’t even deep, that’s Red and Meth I came with (Uh!)
Red nor blue just them two I bang with
I keep pursuin this so don’t get angry
I’m unpredictable sometimes they call me Jamie (Baby!)
So when you see me comin be on your best behavior
‘Cause it’s too early for you to be meetin the savior
Just ’cause for that, here’s a favor (Uh!)
Fuck around with them young boys will Just Blaze ya, hater
You ain’t hardcore fuck it you a liar! (Word!)
That gangsta pass you had expired
Homes you a riot you crack me up
I know a cat with no response that will back me up
(SAY WHAT!) I speak the truth like the bible
You never gonna make it like American Idol

[Hook: Erick Sermon & Redman]
LET’S GO! let’s go let’s go LET’S GO!
Let’s go let’s go LET’S GO!
You can hear what he’s sayin homey he said LET’S GO!
Ok we ain’t playin man I said LET’S GO!
