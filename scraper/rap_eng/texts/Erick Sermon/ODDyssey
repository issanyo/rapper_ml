Elders chide as if they gotta cure his sickness
Or addiction to the sight of liquor bottles pouring liquids
Not as pure as Christians since I'm disregarding your religion
Cause in our opinion, it's a misinforming jurisdiction
Not a burden but I'm certain my assertions are profound
And my sermons leaving churchmen with their turbans on the ground
Working on the sound with a drive to reach perfection
Which is why you see me stretching limo-length in each direction
Me and Lexie not refraining from doing the least expected
Need protection; fuck abstaining from usage of lethal weapons
Weed possession; shoplifting; side-stepping police detection
'Fore I start slipping & fall victim to deep depression
Now, the clocks ticking like Father Time is hot headed
Even God's temper ain't partly hot as my bars
Centrally living in North Memphis; committing some offenses
While dipping from cops, tripping, attempting to hop fences
