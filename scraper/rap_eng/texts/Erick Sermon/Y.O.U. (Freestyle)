I make a booth look like a lavatory with the toilet flooded

Leave a microphone gutted

Under the influence of an illegal substance, I'm not an equal subject

You can't deny this

I'll infect your brain and damage your skull with encephalitis

Step a-side bitch, no need to try this

Your limbs will become a mathematical problem the way I divide it

Without the chainsaw

Fuck them insane laws

Crooked Cops flea the god damn scene with stained draws

I engage war, I'm iller than stage 4

Been a lost cause, too late to pray for

No need to wonder why these fucking demons stay swarmed

We are just guest living in Satan's forum

My lyrical formula attacks your body like Agent Orange

Then find your style placed in storage, cause your shit is boring

Once the words hit my brain the pen explodes like a missile

Now watch what I do with a fucking pistol

I wave my rhyme book over my food when the dinners cold

Your style is so "Ghost Written" your publishing should go to Dennis Coles

I perfect my craft while getting stoned

When my impact is made you can feel my words hitting bones

Worst than a fractured hairline, When I splatter there minds

Phillip Morris should sponsor me you see I kill squares, Right?

This is the part your brain divorces you

If I kicked you in your stomach you'd shit out your last breath cause my Air Forced you

Peep my serial killer torture

When I anoint your daughter with holy water then slurp it of her

Does that annoy you?

What if I took my knife and left her face looking bout as ugly as LaToya

Jackson there's no explanation for my actions

I leave the human body broken down like a mattress

My vivid illustrations you couldn't imagine. Preschool I was taught to ride carpets sort of like Aladdin
