Yo yo, yo, yo.. watch out!! I run New Jerz
Got blood on my wifebeater undershirt (look)
Hand to hand you bout half a gram
I'm a truckload, backin in, under dirt!
Lock on target, your wallet
Your chains I left stains up, gorilla paw prints
Sharp in garments, run out yo' apartment
Vampire, wear yo' garlic
I beef on the streets (gun jammin)
Y'all beef let's meat/meet like Subway sandwiches
You have no idea
Crackheads furnish your homes like Ikea, over here
Bricks, B-R, I, C-K
Where hoes put twelve into size seven CK's
Who's the one? D-O-C
Carryin clips for the agents in +The Matrix+
At the Mobil Awards on the podium
Cause in high school I hung with custodians
Batter-ram your door in
Fuck hot, I'm warpin, Doc torturin your Walkman

[Hook: Redman]
Jump, get up
All my niggas in the house, stalk, get up
All my bitches in the house, jump, get up
All my niggas in the house, stalk, get up
Jump, get up, jump, get up
All my niggas in the house, stalk, get up
All my bitches in the house, jump, get up
All my niggas in the house, stalk, get up
Jump, get up, jump, get up

Yo.. I put a dollar in my zipper
It's pulled out from a mouth of a stripper
Back that thang up, same slut
Used to hang up, now she brain up
I'm like yo (yo) swallow it!
Dick new shit spit throat lozenges
When I'm off the hit {*click-click*}
Hire security to start joggin with, where your office is
I piss on it! Stamp Bricks on it
Take your street work, let your bitch pump it
I'm your next door tenant, that'll strip you down
'til your barefooted like Eric Bennett
Half my brain is still experimentin
Doc already gone before the X kick in
Yeah, I want my cut like G-Money
Stickin the Easter Bunny for sneaker money
Now how many muh'fuckers out there
Is high make some noise (ahhhhhhhhhhh!)
I just tried (ahhh) see last night, had two bitches
Me last night, so I told them to..

[Hook: Redman]
Jump, get up
All my niggas in the house, stalk, get up
All my bitches in the house, jump, get up
All my peoples in the house, jump, get up
Stalk, get up, jump, get up
All my niggas in the house, stalk, get up
All my bitches in the house, jump, get up
All my peoples in the house, jump, get up
Stalk, get up, jump, get up
All my niggas in the house, stalk, get up
All my bitches in the house, jump, get up
All my peoples in the house, jump, get up
Stalk, get up, jump, get up
All my niggas in the house, stalk, get up
All my bitches in the house, jump, get up
All my peoples in the house, jump, get up
Stalk, get up, jump, get up

The gorilla in the motherfuckin mix
They call him Lethal Lip
The linguistic full metal jacket of vernacular ballistic
Shootin off at the mouth without chap or a blister
He got hairs on his funk and didn't flunk diaper rash
Gorilla goin postal.. verbally toxic
Metal pierced forked and hollow point tongue
Dum-dums piled shot from gamblin gorilla gums
Hooked on phonics, packin a viscious vocabulary
Malicious with malice and mayhem
Fuck a gorilla dictionary, Magilla Gorilla talkin to ya
Yo-hoooooooo!
Sup Brick City? T.C., what it be like?
Yeahhh motherfucker!
You got thirty-five seconds to get yo' ass to the flo'
