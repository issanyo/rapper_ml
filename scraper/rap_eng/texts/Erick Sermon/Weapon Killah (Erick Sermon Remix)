[Verse 1: Nitemare]
Ha ha ha ha ha just right, as I can leaving you in the casket
Goddamn you son of a bitch I'm going to get you in the basket
Basket case I knowing you can dying forever
See you in hell for a week day another flever
I made a shotgun AK 47 and knife let's get started
I make some barbecue and I put on the fire paper and sticks I just doing cooked your head off until it's ready started
I eat your head off and I just swallowing your head off
Punching bag getting stronger fights some beating than said off
I'll gonna knock you out to a bloody pulp
And you getting with finish I can do it then stronger I drinking GULP
Muscle stronger, going back to gym
Like you either now so I can back out from the bin
As I can beat you up and now you do like busy
Staying home busy out crew I know was gone fisy
Screaming bloody murder like grave diggers and then I know you ready for my niggas
Bring your daughter and bring to your slaughter

[Verse 2: Stalker]
Yeah!
Lemme fill 'em with venom duplicate it and finish it
Niggas really wanna see the syllable diminish it
Finally your freaking family's fatality will be the first
You heard of the killer with scriller and will uh be the worst
The ultimate killing machine even with a hammer and nail
Your skills on the microphone are tagged as an epic fail
You take sail, never lost without your good sense
Anytime we be coming up in the motherfucking spot you turn tense
Because we mother thugging fuck it, we the Night of the Living Dead
Weapon Killer will blind you go behind you and push you down the stairs
All of your raps are now useless stupid pieces of wasteful scripture
Criminal the killer about to paint a nigga another picture
Killing the rhythm and filling em with skill and I will still murder
I chill the bill and pill the spill, and a motherfucker will heard a
Giving another chopper to stop her own rhymes with the niggas killer
Never heard of us, Tomb, Stalker and Nitemare, I got a weapon killer

[Verse 3: Tomb]
I need ya and feed ya to kill you and bury you again
Pills are broken and you be praying like Amen
The babysitter are threatened
When you fucking with Chamber and Underground Weapon
If you be messing with a nigga
Then you best be ready to pull the trigga
I hope you find yourself disappointed with your music
Like he said "We could win or lose it"
Tomb, Stalker and Nitemare, and a machete
Packing more heat than Lethal Weapon mixed with Freddy
Serial killer and giving your wife a heartache
Making another motherfucking niggas heart quake
We could win it or lose that shit
I'mma get a gun and use that shit
Never with the grenade 'bout to diffuse that shit
Tomb, Stalker and Nietmare is who do that shit
NIGGA!
