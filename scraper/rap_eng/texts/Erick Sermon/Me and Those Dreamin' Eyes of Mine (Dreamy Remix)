[Verse 1]
When I first saw you baby
I wanted to die
Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine
Started to cry then I'd dream
Wishin' my fantasy
Would soon become a reality
(Yeah, let ‘em know, yo)
‘Cause every time I see you baby
All I do is sigh
‘Cause you're the most precious thing baby
That my dreamin' eyes has ever seen
So I continue to dream
Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine

[Pre-Chorus: D'Angelo]
Ohhhh
Is it just that you're the finest little thing that I ever saw
Or is my imagination running too far
Or is it that my eyes are telling me something you could never see
Something like me being with you
And you being with me
(Break it down, word)

[Chorus: D'Angelo]
Ooh wee baby you've redefined my vision of love it seems
You're love be the cherry in my chocolate covered dreams
So it seems my oh my
Me and those dreamin’ eyes of mine
(Check it)

[Verse 2]
Oh my goodness here she comes
Switching that ass
I wonder if the men in her past
Had treated her bad
But if I had the chance
I'd treat her like a queen
Just like I do in all my dreams
(Word up)
If you only knew how many times
That I think of you
I'm quite sure that you would find, yeah
I'm sure that you would find
I'm going out my mind
My oh my, me and those dreamin’ eyes of mine

[Pre-Chorus: D'Angelo]
Ohhhh (Break it down)
Is it just that you're the finest little thing that I ever saw
Or is my imagination running too far
Or is it that my eyes are telling me something you could never see
Something like me being with you
And you being with me

[Chorus: D'Angelo]
Ooh wee baby you've redefined my vision of love it seems
You're love be the cherry in my chocolate covered dreams
So it seems my oh my
Me and those dreamin’ eyes of mine

[Interlude: Common]
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister (Repeat 8X)

[Pre-Chorus: D'Angelo]
(Is it that she’s just the finest little thing)
Is it just that you're the finest little thing that I ever saw
Or is my imagination running too far
Or is it that my eyes are telling me something you could never see
Something like me being with you
And you being with me

[Chorus: D'Angelo]
Ooh wee baby you've redefined my vision of love it seems
You're love be the cherry in my chocolate covered dreams
So it seems my oh my
Me and those dreamin’ eyes of mine
