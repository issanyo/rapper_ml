[Chamillionaire]
Wazzap Forty, it's Chameleon. Gotta few words to say on
Behalf of that Swishahouse. (What, what) What. What (What, what)

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Look look
Is you a hot girl, if not girl
Can't be touchin' my hot spot girl
I can't be all up in that cot girl
I'm runnin' wit Michael Watts girl
This is our world what you can't you tell
Just look at the ice on my bezale
My bread is green but it ain't stale
TVs in a 6 hundred V12
While the beats swell and I'm slugged up
The Chamillion be tatted and thugged up
My money be gettin' all jealous
You gotta move I can't be hugged up
They bugged up selective sounds that offence
Some ballers blockin' watchin' they knock us
Cuz we ridin' in the candy red droppers
On choppin' they love that
I see that big ass and I love that
Like Juvenile back that ass up in my direction
And let me rub that
Swishahouse don't need to dub that
Go get you some Swishahouse socks
Go get you some new shoes
Put Swishahouse on top of your Reeboks
Boy if your tryin' to get rich
Go and get some Swishahouse stocks
Cuz if it ain't platinum or gold
Then it didn't come from that Michael Watts

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
Boy whatsapp Mike Watts
I'm rocking Reeboks with white socks
Paul Wall be breakin' the mic while
Micheal Watts be choppin' da [?]
Choppin' yo block up with big throwed
We 'bout to go 'head in some Lexus
Best to quit runnin' yo mouth
Cuz my gorilla's been known to kick door
I'm Paul Wall camouflage boy
With soldier in my crouch
And if we get in some drama
Demy and Davis carry they Glock
With Terry off in the garage boy
He ready to gettin' the glassback
Jump Rrari' I bump in the black Lac'
With the fat back, in his backpack
When the back crack, we turn hands
My drop be makin' a [?]
I can catch boppa's
If I rolled on spare tires and doughnuts
Watts be bringin' that chopp back
You bootleggers best to stop that
Confidence in the Swishahouse album
In a few months we 'bout to drop

[Verse 3: DJ Michael (5000) Watts]
They call me Big Watts
On [?] where you'll find me
Foes that hate me, find me
But they can't stop me
All about makin' the come up
I'm bussin' on nigga's that run up
Gotta stay real, gotta make me a mill
Gotta roll in a Lex that's thugged up
All about makin' my paper
I'm all about fuckin' off haters
Keep me a nine, gotta stay underground
Talk shit but you can't fade us

Hugh, how you love that. Swishahouse '99 baby. That's how
We do it. H-Town, nigga's got me rappin' in this bitch, I be damned
