-Listen
Man Chamill, that nigga still handlin' steel
Hoppin' out the Sedan Deville, ay man just chill
Leave em' alone, see niggas never plan to feel
The back-hand until they talkin' or you came in his grill
I don't care, undercovers still yearnin' to stop me
Same retailers I sell it to will burn em' a copy
Then sell it to you, but the cd's burning is sloppy
They earning they dollar, that I'm supposed to earn in it's got me
Pissed and ag'd, get in the slab, gimme some gas
Fixin' the track, this nigga bout to kick me some ass
(Repeat after Talking)
This be the last time I let niggas get me for cash
Gimme some gasoline and burn his crib into ash
Hold up Watts niggas is cheap sayin' I charge to much
Cuz I'm raw nigga what?
Yall can't compete, yall niggas suck
If I gotta deal with the embarassment of yall niggas stuff
Then mo' money will ease the pain, bar'd that bar in ya cup
Hold up Watts, boot-leggers? Them niggas be scared
But a mind full of scared
Is better then a mind full of lead
Nightmare, wake up, pillow red, mind in his bed
Now Koopa's joking go back to sleep, never mind what he said
Look for that First Round Draft Picks, nothin' but net
I gotta homie street-sweeper, and his cousin is tech
Doesn't respect? I'ma put ya tongue up in the deck
And put my dick in the speakers and put nut in ya neck
