[Intro: Bobby V and (Chamillionaire)]
(Yeah) I'm popping bottles of patron (popping bottles of Patrón)
All night long (Chamillionaire and Bobby V, we in VIP)
It's on, it's on (hah, Chamillitary mayne)

[Hook: Bobby V]
I don't normally drink, but tonight I'm gone
Gone off that rosé, gone off that Patrón
I'm so gone (baby)
I'm tryna wash my problems away (just for the day)
Had too much to drink, I won't say I'm drunk
But I think I drank
A little too much Patrón
I'm so gone (baby)
I'm tryna wash my problems away (just for the day)

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
You might say I'm such a flirt
Lipstick on my neck and shirt
Chicks all up in VIP, on my neck like it's dessert
Said I was at work, and that's really where I was at first
Now I'm out with her, and she's tryna make my pockets hurt
Any drink that you prefer, any drink that you prefer
Knew that that will work, been a playa ever since my birth
Money is a curse, but I always chase the money first
Wonder why these girls, keep on asking what my necklace worth
Made a bunch of money, got a lot of cars
Got a lot of groupies, that wanna be involved
I could have them all, but my life ain't gonna change
Cause my problems still around the corner waiting
I put my city on, now my money long
Man I shoulda known
My haters woulda grown
And no I normally don't
But tonight I need a drink, so I'm in the club like "what you drinking?"

[Hook: Bobby V]

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
You might say I'm such a flirt
Lipstick on my neck and shirt
Chicks all up in VIP, dancing in their mini skirts
Lookin at them curves, baddest woman in the universe
I'm just telling her, I need you to be my passenger
Haters getting on my nerves, haters getting on my nerves
And they better learn, they gon' always get what they deserve
Money is a curse, but not having money is the worst
I'll get back to work, but I'm 'bout to sip this Henney first
Said it ain't tricking if you just spend it
I'mma run outta dough in a minute
Every chick saying she's independent
Staring at the diamonds all in my pendant
I'm not offended
Still tryna find out what her friend is
She tryna find out where my Benz is
I'm so glad I got a ten-innn
It's time to get it
Tell me when the last time that you've been
With a playa this cool
I bet he isn't
All eyes on me like a witness
Told her I didn't
Drink it, yeah, I really meant it
But everybody is all up in my business
And I'm hoping this Henny help me forget it

[Hook: Bobby V]

[Outro: Bobby Valentino and (Chamillionaire)]
(Yeah) Crown
(Crown Royal) Royal and Patrón
(And Patrón, you know it's on) I'm so gone
(I promise you I'll go back to doing what I do tomorrow, but I've got bills, I've got stress)
(And this buzz is) just for the day
Crown (Chamillitary mayne)
Royal and Patrón (uh, it's going down)
I'm so gone (I'm so gone right now, feelin so goodm so great)
(But this buzz I've got is really) just for day
