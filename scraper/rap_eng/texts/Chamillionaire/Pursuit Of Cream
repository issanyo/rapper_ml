What is the pursuit of happiness if it isn't cream
Looked down and I told my shadow we'd make the perfect team
In search of cream, my perfect scheme, to purchase things
A breathe of fresh air is rare — I'm breathing dirty steam
Murcielago with model that love to work dem jeans
The pillow thin as the wind sir I know they heard the screams
Angels was flying my woman cookin' and burning wings
My youngest niece asked her uncle tell me what murder means
I said my voice to the microphone every verse should sting
Not prince Hakeem no longer I now prefer the king
They take the truth and they twist it and they convert they dreams
I swear these rappers be actin like they rehearsing scenes CUT
What type of bull crap they on
Imaginations is vivid get a full pack of crayons
Safety ain't even safe so the full clip stay on
Most of these rappers is actually the fools they prey on
And these deals they given to y'all is all little
I'm bout a steak and that deal is what I would call kibble
They tryin' to run before they even let the ball dribble
And that's a travel I used to travel in an orange skittle
Color Beamer I got my cream up and now it's true
That every offers an offer I feel I can refuse
But if the offer is boss enough then I'm gon' review
Sit in my office the boss is gonna get back to you turn up my amplitude

Listenin' to Eminem — send up an R.I.P. to Proof
Em told me that his lil brother how he got introduced
To me the truth I went to the west to see the Snoop
Told me Adam and Eve would've took the weed but they seen the fruit
Jay told me that I remind him of Kanye
The humble one cause I'm passionate bout what I say
If another hit ain't my fate then I had a nice stay
Keepin' it black for corporates I'm feelin' like Sway

[Singing]
When you doing ya thang everyones in love with you
Yea they all start callin'
So I erased ya number out of my memory
Cause I don't live in Hollywood
Where do I go if hustlin' is all I know
And it's all I want to do it's wonderful
Yea they all start callin' [x7]

They looove me now say they love me
Yea they all start callin'
They looove me now say they love me
Yea they all start callin'
