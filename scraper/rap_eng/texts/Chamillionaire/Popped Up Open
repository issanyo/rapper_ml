(Talking)
Naw I'm sayin?
Trunk stay extra extended
Tippin' down, popped up, wide open

My kit hit the ground, my rims spin around
In my trunk something rattlin' in my whip its surround
But let me break it down, I call Liz grippin' pine
My moonroof tilted up but I say tippin down
Tourist picture time when I lift it's a sign
Extended at the angle is the trunk fifth recline
The wheel on the rear will still disappear
Fold up under that bumper grill-lady gone chill
Neon light glowin' lemme show you what it say
Ready wit a L before the L is an A
Already (already), already all day
Didn't want to get paid so I displayed me some braids
Used to ride blades still riding wet
Cause wanted to ball, fet cut the check
Laws get upset hellraiser in the deck
Down for my dogs like white lady at the vet
Black corvette (nah) that was Manny Fresh's
Piece got you puzzled like we playing Tetris
Cell steady ringing had to check my message
Haters in the magazine tellin' me confessions
But I ain't no Usher, Chamillionaire'll crush ya
Chamillionaire ain't hangin' wit ya if he doesn't trust ya
E put the clear coats then called the buffer
Had to charge 'em up for gettin' paint on my muffler
Me and Archie Lee done popped into Harlem Nights
Ball my bills tossin so my aim be precise
Promote my wallet then live up to the hype
But King Koopa ain't the type to make a strippin' chick my wife
Told me she buzzin' ain't looking for her husband
Well call a couple friends while I'm looking for my cousin
Tires that I'm hullin' crawlin' up cullin'
Headed to the wim? I ain't headed towards nothing
I ain't with the segregation my diamonds stay together
But I ain't gon lie color diamonds bling better
Love all the women chocolate, caramel, vanilla
Tryin' to get up in that groove, I don't need to chase Stella
Candy cumin' on the hood the climax it gets wetter
My boys on gulf bank coming up with clientela
My boy on Scott Street will hit you with that new Beretta
I don't ever switch (why?) Northside forever
Forever, forever, ever, Fred Gruger
Choppin' boys up its Mr. Mixtape Buddah
Cooler than the cooler don't let the mug fool ya
So gon' keep it cool or I'ma gon' get the Ruger
Where the Ron C? That's the homie
Chamillitary click nigga that's the army
Back up in the streets for all the boys that want me
Me at Club Blue all the drinks is on me (sike)

You know you wrong for that nigga
