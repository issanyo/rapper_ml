[Intro]
See I ain’t tripping, but I’m just saying
See a rapper and she tell you they had a little thang
Calling every player in the game by they nickname
See her with another baller when your ankle get sprained

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Heard about me through hearsay
Then get up out of my damn face
I ain’t never had a hand out
That’s why I ain’t handing out hand shakes
Got no time for that pillow talk
Y’all feminine to my man ways
Love the ladies but I let them know
That my bank account is my man cave
If that’s what she doing for a fountain drink
Then what she doing for Ace of Spades
Giving knowledge like she skipped a grade
What's yo GPA I'm gonna make it raise
Grease it up just like a taper fade
Treat my dick just like a razor blade
Cause when I pull it out she says it’s time to cut
I guess I should have came with a band-aid
Can’t assume, she came by herself, cause she telling you
That she lonely
Can’t assume, she just texting you
Cause she message you on that phone G
Can’t assume that she squeaky clean
Cause she let you see her get soapy
Can’t assume she came to see you
Courtside, and not to see Kobe
You can’t mess around with my homie
And turn around and rub on me
And tell your friends that I’m not the truth
Cause I didn’t wanted to get cozy
Holy Ma-tri-mony, with my cash Theres never adultery
Cause the same girl that’s laying on your chest
Will try to double cross you like rosaries
See I’m just sticking to the G code
I’m just worried bout me code
Soon as I see that she see through
I ain’t looking through the peep hole
I won’t pay for no peep show
I’m just trying to get deep dough
And than beat them beats up on beast mode
So you can watch them copy like Kinko's

I know plenty G’s that do dope deals
And millionaires that got more mills
Smart enough to not give it up
To every pretty woman in heaux heels
I can’t give her no dough still
Her friends is saying I’m so trill
Killing y’all with my vogue wheels
And that’s what the hell I call road kill

[Hook]
Ok, be careful who you let kiss ya
Cause you know a player won’t miss ya
Just gonna ex you out of the picture
No lie, no lie, no lie
No lie, no lie, no lie
Say you know what I’ll do
I’ma tell that ho goodbye
I’ma tell that ho goodbye
When I know she ain’t true
I’ma tell that ho goodbye
I’ma tell that ho goodbye
Girl you know that we through
I’ma tell that ho goodbye
I’ma tell that ho goodbye
Yeah I’m talking bout you
I’ma tell that ho goodbye

Girl you know I stay fly as hell
Chicken heads that
All the birds are fly down south
So I’m still the man with that clientele X 2

I’ma tell that ho goodbye
I’m still the man with that clientele
I’ma tell that ho goodbye
I’m still the man with that clientele
I think you’re better off by yourself

[Verse 2:]
I might go and purchase your broad a skirt
And let her get a new bra & shirt
And take your chick to my concert
And then let her get her star search
These just the same as these other rappers
We know it’s sweeter than starburst
I might throw a bone in your broad purse
I’ma eat with my dogs first
Big dog without any bark
I got plenty bite and know plenty sharks
Hit the lake and pull out the boat
And have chickens flocking like Noahs Arch
Know your work then know your part
Know your work then know your part
Not attracted to any chicks that know every player
That’s known to start

Hold up, I can’t be caught in no twister
I hope you’re fine as your sister
Cause if not I’m prolly gonna switch ya
No lie, no lie, no lie
I’ma tell that ho goodbye
I’ma tell that ho goodbye
Be on your way
