(Chorus-Cham)
I tried to call up God and complain
But then he said why you callin my name
It's Just Pain, Pain-It's Just Pain, Pain
It's Just Pain, and it's apart of the game

I tried to call up God's name
Then he said all you do is complain
It's Just Pain, Pain-It's Just Pain, Pain
It's Just Pain, and it's apart of the game

(Cham's Verse)
The industry is a robber, my mental be really bothered
Not talkin to any callers, escape the clutch as a povert-ty
Close to my Momma, ain't really close to my Father
The more I became a baller, the more I seen him get Fathered
Cause I don't trust you enough to let you inside of my mind
And even if I let you in, couldn't handle what you would find
I done been through serious times, and don't care if you think I'm lyin
I was grown at the age of nine, wanted to get you out of a bind
I spent my savings to save you, tryna get you up out of jail
Had to sign that little paper, promisin you wouldn't jump ya bail
But then what you do, jump ya bail-they want you, and want me as well
Then the day it happened to me, yeah I hated it-it was hell
And you had to know that I hate it, I hate it-I'm irritated
It's loud and it's getting crowded, my space is gettin invaded
No nachos but it was some vatos who said they don't speak no English
I'm telling e'm make some room, and they lookin like "what you mean"
And it ain't no such thing as team, when the janitor wanna take ya spot
You the one that's on the bench watchin I'm the one who's takin the shot
And I seen the hate on ya face, the moment you seen it drop
Even people that's really close try to take ya down from the top
What about that little fan, tried to say that I had a baby
A baby, I ain't even met her so it ain't even a maybe
Plus her skin is caucausian-she tryin to reach me daily
A groupie, won't be a lady-she's obviously tryin to play me
It's obvious she was crazy-only thing she could do
Is go find a stupid rich rapper that's out there that she could screw
And now she feelin so stupid, and it shows what I said was true
If I plan to go sleep with a white girl, then I wouldn't go sleep with you
So I keep sayin his name, and he say I say it in vain
He say the only time I call is when it's some pain
Tried to mess with my little sis and I threw some salt in ya game
Cause I knew you was old enough to be one of our parents mayne
But a shame on you, a shame-you the only person to blame
When a twenty five person gang, tried to jump me and take my chain
I was the only person not wet, by the punches thrown in the rain
And I couldn't hold any grudges, I said I forgive you mayne
It's true that he had a temper, my Father wasn't bein gentle
At night I would wake up to knockin, my Momma tryna get in the window
Turn on the TV, tryna act like I'm tryna play the Nintendo
The house done burned down forever and no longer sentimental
They livin and lovin life till his girl done fell off that bike
And he happened to still survive but his future don't look as bright
I admit that I got mad at ya and wish we both could fight
When I knock on them Pearly Gates, just don't tell me to take a hike
