[Intro: Al Pacino]
The time has come, we gotta expand, the whole operation
Distribution, New York, Chicago, L.A
We gotta set our own mark, and enforce it
We gotta think big now
Think big

[Verse 1]
Sitting in my jacuzzi, sitting in my jacuzzi
Over here talking about 9-5, nah, that ain't gon' move me
Anything less than ten, bro, that's that old Nintendo
Cause y'all playin' games, stop playing games, I spent that on my windows
(You spent that on your) N-O, I spent that on my ten ho
When your dough get long enough, then they said you got extendo
You can turn your doors to bulletproof and that won't stop an attempt, though
Ain't worried about anybody shooting through cause I'm thinking 'bout the demo
(Hello? Hello?) Don't call me on the wrong Jack
(Don't call you on the wrong, what?) No, just hang up and don't call back
Hope your car is trustworthy, hope you got the car fax
Hope you don't open the door and explode right after contact
I keep a banana with me, I think I'm Axel Foley
Hope you get my point like you try not to be a goalie
You said "they have real rubber", what's this garbage they sold me
If the world was sucker free, then I'd probably be here lonely

[Hook]
If you ain't got it, you ain't God of me and you just ain't the same
Got that viral "Ammunition", watch me hit them with the pain
Sitting in my Jacuzzi, watching a groupie do her thang
If she work it well enough, I might remember this girl's name
Moving through the airport, hundreds with the small face
I know they gon' check me so they [?]
Walk into the [?] house, she thought this was our place
This my house, what you think, it's Scarface

[Bridge]
Yeah, this world is all mine
Yeah, this world is all mine
I said, yeah, this world is all mine
Yeah, this world is all mine

[Interlude: Al Pacino]
You need people like me, so you can point your fucking fingers, and say "that's the bad guy." Well say good night to the bad guy!

[Verse 2:]
All mine, all mine, come and take me up off the throne
They'll pull my hollows up out your dome
And I'm back in town, I ride alone, they tryna run up inside my home
Copycats, my body clones, oh, no, they softer than Styrofoam
If your problems with me is on wax
I'm gon' argue with you, that's non-fact, I don't buy them weed, I buy 'em back
I could sit on top of these tall Gats, just sit on top of these tall stacks
And be higher than you little liars in, you still wouldn't get to reach where I'm at
I lead where I'm at, and I'm poppin' up on you out the blue
Who you think that you talkin' to, what that do casa mi casa, fool
Keep surveillance for all my haters, you watchin' me, well, I'm watchin' you
Keep the butcher knife and a drill, just try not to get chopped and screwed

[Hook]
