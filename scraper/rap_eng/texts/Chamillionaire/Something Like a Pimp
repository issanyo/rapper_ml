[Intro]
That's right, Chamillitary Mane
You know southern players
We just keep the pimpin', we don't pay
That's right

[Hook]
Man I'm something like a pimp (like a pimp)
Cause she's thinking bout me while she with him (while she with him)
Man I'm something like a pimp (like a pimp)
Bet ya I could pull her on the first attempt
Say she want to bring some friends (well bring some friends den)
We can work it out like you in the gym (we can work it out)
Man I'm something like a pimp
The money stops and our relationship will end (that's right)

[Verse 1]
I'm watching a flick with her, trynna get her to rewind
I'm serious bout my pimpin', trynna get up in her mind
Her face look kinda fine but she look better from behind
Would of told her to turn around, but instead its never mind
I need a dime, ain't looking for no 9 or no 8
Know that red lobster got ya dirty mind thinking wait
If I pay to fill up your plate, just for this time it be great
But I'm interrupting your thought cause I don't buy a hoe no steak
If it is a plate, ain't gonna be no shrimp or steak or siding
Should of seen it as soon as you seen me, baby use your logic
If you want to know what the answer is then you will find it
Use your mind and you gon' be fine, try to dry your eyelids
Mr. King Koopa, you must of got him
Confused with them other dudes, excuse me I'm not them
I'm not him, I'm not him, Houston has a problem
We can do what you want to do with all my niggas watching

[Hook]
Man I'm something like a pimp
Cause she's thinking bout me while she with him
Man I'm something like a pimp
Bet ya I could pull her on the first attempt
Say she want to bring some friends
We can work it out like you in the gym
Man I'm something like a pimp
The money stops and our relationship will end
