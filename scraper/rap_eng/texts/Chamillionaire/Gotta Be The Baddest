Intro
Oh(Oh)...Whoa(Whoa)
She so beautiful (Isn't she)
Na, I'm not talkin' bout you
Move to the left
I'm talkin' bout the car (Laughs)
I'm just playing baby

[Verse 1:]
Now this for all the guys who tricking on all the women I know
Writing love notes like I paid the note on your Tahoe
Purchasing more than nachos, chocolates and moscatos
Say she your darling and you balling like Chicago
You giving her D.Rose, you trying to be MVP man
Most valuable player you should throw your defeat in
Love her and never cheating you eating and never skeeting
Lean in the car and kiss me before she can get her feet in (Haha)
Ayy
That just mean that she couldn't wait
She tell me I smell good, I tell her she looking great
She say that she love the car to get it what did it take
I say this isn't a rental, it didn't come with a rate, we late
Let off the brakes and then we proceed to coast
I tell her that if she wants she can get as high as the slopes
She say that she doesn't smoke do you? I tell her nope
And that one word got her wet as a bar of soap
Let's open an envelope we gotta give an award (award)
To someone who could pull them by never saying a word (Haha)
Before ever leaving the curb without opening liquor and never breaking an herb
I know this don't sound possible to some of you lames
Bout to strain your whole brain tryin' get her to change
You got to name drop names of every person you came
In contact with in your life that's just terrible game (Come on)
Ain't gotta spend a milli on her and be living the lie
Just be playa you should give it a try
And if you know your never ever tricking on no woman like I
Then all my players put your hands in the sky, one mo time

[Hook:]
Ain't gotta spend a milli on her and be living a lie (Ain't gotta spend yo money on her, just be a playa)
Just be a playa you should give it a try (Just be a playa pimp)
And if you know your never ever tricking on no woman like I (Nasayn)
Then all my players put your hands in the sky
(Wassup 2x)

You gotsta be the baddest
You gotsta be the baddest girl
You gotsta be the baddest
You gotsta be the baddest girl

[Verse 2:]
You know you gotsta be the baddest
If you really going make me add this
6 dollars and 55 cents to my tab miss
Wait a second just do the math if
This equals a drink then it also equals your address
Haha I'm just playing nah I'm just serious (Yea)
Object in the mirror is clearer than it appear it is
Every girl that's hearing this wanna ride a luxurious
Mercedes for ladies with the upgraded interiors
Yea, roam with a player that got experience
Stunting and feeling on all of your different areas
Playing spin the bottle till we both get delirious
Curiosity killed, the cat just call me curious (What up)
Because you know I'm bout to kill it tonight
All my players put your hands in the sky
And ladies you say you partying with us and say you bringing a friend as fine you, it better not be a tie
Cause you gotsta be the baddest
Really your friend is average
You dope and your friend shady it's like I'm Ca$his
Really she should relax, if I'm talking to you then why is she saying your ad-libs (you bad miss)
Nah I don't trust her she got a fast lip
If her mouth could run, I know hers would run a lap quick
Fast chick if she ain't a snake then she an actress
Leave her alone with me well see how cut that the grass is

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
You know I lost a little venom the lyrics are still as toxic
Looking at my watch she notice it ain't a clock tick (Woo)
None of em successful when ever they try to lock chicks
Cause in another life I probably coulda been a locksmith (Come on)
Hear boys saying nah he ain't messing with my chick
Now she shotgun and that's why they call it the cockpit
Then I see you in your lil' designer outfit
And look at you what is that velvet or just ostrich (Haha)
You fly you even bought you a tie
I walked right past her and didn't even say hi
She turned and watched me walk past and yell bye
I'm wondering what I said to even make her reply (Hol' up)
I guess that's how it goes when your dealing with pro's
I'm really saying nothing and she know to remove her clothes
Ain't taking none of these hoes you know to proper dose (Wassup)
I'm pulling up to the curb and then I'm just popping doors
Get out!
