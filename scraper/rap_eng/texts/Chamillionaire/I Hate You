[Chorus x2: Z-Ro]
I hate you bitch, I hate you bitch
I hate you bitch, I never thought I'd say

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
Too many years, I done paid the price
Why you gotta put all this, drama in my life
And day after day, I'm on the grind for you
Living lavish drape you in karats, what I'm trying to do
But Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii'm, just a man
Trying to do all I can, but you act like you can't understand
Well I done sacrificed, and I done swallowed my pride
On the wrong road, trying to follow my pride
I was daddy for a while, though I've got no seed
But the kids, are my H-E-A-R-T
I've been dealing with a lot, so I've been losing my mind
Straight up acting before I think, barely using my mind
My freedom is on the line, and my sanity's gone
You picked a fine time to leave me, now this house ain't a home
I had no problem being faithful, I loved you so much I hate you
Because you left me, when I needed you the most
So now a bitch, is how I rate you
My female friends, making you wonder
Guilt got you feeling suspicious, from when you was creeping on me
On the under, but even still I held my head
Five kids and I fed em all, with moldy bread and spreads
Them was my motherfuckers, treated em like sisters and brothers
But somehow I fell out of place, fucking with they punk ass mother
I apologize, I wish I can turn back the hands of time
Wishing we could pillow fight, just one more time
But Ms. Ronda, wanna put them laws in my life
Although I'm happy, I never pictured you not at all in my life
Solo that's how I kick it, the rest of my days
But I wanna thank you for making possible, some of the best of my days
I've dried my eyes, now and all they can see is the greed
You can have that jury, broke ass motherfuckers the seventh scene

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
She's never elevating
Somebodies always hating
Looks in the mirror can't see that person is who she facing
And I'm always paper chasing
So y'all be never racing
Every conversation she start with is for your information
Always work and I'm on the job
It's like I never go on a break
Travelling and I shared my car
Just cause I can afford a break
She got the shrimp and I ordered steak
Wanna know why I'm sorta late
Cause it's always bein buisness first
Who told her we on a date
Two hundred for a plate
Not for a braud that's fake
3 dimes I got more than a quarter out in florida state
A super gorgeous shape
And a chest that won't deflate
Comin over to show me how her bra and panties said coordinate
I'm focused as a lense
I'm only touching tens
I'm stroking while I'm poking showing her how long it extends
If I say I'm messing witcha
Don't mean I need ya friends
Two seater benz tell em they can call that gettin revenge

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Too many years, I done paid the price
Why you gotta put all this, drama in my life
And day after day, I'm on the grind for you
Living lavish drape you in karats, what I'm trying to do
But Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii'm, just a man
Trying to do all I can, but you act like you can't understand
Well I done sacrificed, and I done swallowed my pride
On the wrong road, trying to follow my pride
I was daddy for a while, though I've got no seed
But the kids, are my H-E-A-R-T
I've been dealing with a lot, so I've been losing my mind
Straight up acting before I think, barely using my mind
My freedom is on the line, and my sanity's gone

[Chorus]
