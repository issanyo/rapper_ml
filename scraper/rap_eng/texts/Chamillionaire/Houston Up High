I said I'm from the h-town that's why your girl say
She outside on the curb mayne
She wanna ridddeee, girl I know you wanna ridddeee
Cause we still ride on swangs and the vogues
Pop rubberbands cause we got plenty dough
Throw so money in the skyyyy and put your h's up higgghhh
Hop up in my drop told em that I'm coming
Represent the h like a rocket or a comet
Hit the harlem nights maybe later hit the onyx
And we party till 4 in the mornn
First I hit the north cause you know I run it
Then I hit the south and put some frenchies in my stomach
Hit the galarea make a purchase if I want it
And I'm about to tear down the malll
When she walked in she said baby what's up with you sir
Gotta get the money that's what I get in the booth for
You ain't got it locked you'd better not introduce her
I'll turn her neck and wrists to stones no medusa PSYCHE
I ain't intrested in your cougar
Try anotha angle then disappear like bermuda
Ain't nobody cooler, manuever how I manuever
And realise what all the women is gettin nude for
Thanks for the frank I fronted your boy a mueller
Gucci manes jeweler asked me to be his jeweler
Cause icier than a scuba, diver that live beside and eskimo igloo huh
And yea ya should know my steelo
Got her taken shots on her stomach like ne-yo
Got her rentin speedos put in a torpedo
And that's a situation like a jersey show gweedo
Freeo that's the discription of my game in spanish
At 13 halle told me I was actin manish
Berry I thought I would grow to be a mechanic
I was wrong but I can fix it baby don't panic
No gilligan me n' your girl so stranded
I'm a skipper if she ain't about the dough dammit
I got so much paper but it ain't no tablet
Soon as I throw it in the air I bet ya go n grab
