[Intro]
I wanna just say, hi haters, hi haters
I know you missed me, I'm back
You know who I am
No introduction needed, ha-ha

[Hook]
I'm the one that run the state
I'm the one that get the cake
I'm the one that isn't fake
(I'm the one that you should hate)
I'm the one that's living great
I'm the one that's getting paid
I'm the one that's in your face
(I'm the one that you should hate)

[Verse 1]
Tell your girl, I love hangin' with her I sure ain't gonna miss her
She a hopeless romantic and I sure ain't gonna kiss her
Chain gettin' thicker, my chain got a flicker
Diamond so large I photoshop my chain in the picture
So many ways to tell you how I'm paid
To tell you 'bout my swangs, paralyze(?) a new blade
Tell you I might go +Geico+ and tell you how much I saved
I put up my cars in line and it's gonna look like a parade
Diamonds got 'em leaning grabbin' these fightin' with my ear
Lettin' bet the top look like my drop fightin' with the air
Leanin' in my whip it's like my posture fightin' with the chair
Me and two chicks in the whip playin' truth or dare
Yeah

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You can hate me, you can hate me, you can hate me(hi hater, hi hater)
I'm the one that you should hate
You can hate me, you can hate me, you can hate me(hi hater, hi hater)
I'm the one that you should hate

[Verse 2]
Let's erase my history, my Grammy and my platinum sales
Let's erase the motorcycle and the seat that comes with scale
And subtract a lot of millions from my bank account as well
Then you probably still will be a hater, hatin' I can tell
Every time that you reply, when you talkin' you a lie
Any plan to go against Chamillionaire, suicide
Every verse is supafly, confidence is supa high
Stupid I, ain't gonna let you stop me hater, move around
I'm getting money baby and gonna get plenty mo'(whoa!)
Just to had to let you know
(I'm the one that you should hate)
They said I couldn't make it, they said I wouldn't blow(blow)
But look who run the show
(I'm the one that you should hate)

[Hook]

Hi haters, hi haters
(I'm the one that you should hate)
Hi haters, hi haters
(I'm the one that you should hate)
