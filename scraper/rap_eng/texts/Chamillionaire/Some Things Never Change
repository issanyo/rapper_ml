[Intro]
Never change it'll never change
But one thing I know about the game is it'll never change

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Ugh
Koopa H town trill figga made my name from selling right
Cause most of these boys just selling out
The rest of these boys just selling hype
Naw get it right they hype beastin' to get accepted
I don't really see no reason for impressing people that ain't impressive
Still too legit if you base your worth off who ya with
I hope you get your whole crew or clique to stand on a cliff and go do a flip
I could never become diluted in a couple minutes I'm gonna prove it
H Town's undisputed but
Can't you see that I'm coming down can't you see me reclining
Independent still moving more than these fraudulents that they signing
Never question my hustle hater you can question my timing
But I'll forever be hard to budge like them Houston Texan front lineman

[Hook]
Something's never change, something's never change
Cause game is full is still of lames
The game still full of lames
Something's never change, something's never change
Get some change then they start acting strange
Then they start acting so strange
Some things never change, never change
Never change it'll never change, never change
Somethings never change, some things never change
But one thing I know about the game it's probably never gonna change

Coming down, coming down
Oh Oh oh it won't
Coming down, coming down
Oh oh oh it won't change

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Look how well I represent
They can talk down I let em vent
These boys living in my house
It's just temporary I let em rent
Don't get too comfortable until I want you to
Don't think about dropping something new
Ill have you thought was hungrier eating lunchables for a month or two
Just have plan b to comfort you
You got it hey way to go
For those that talk that ain't made the dough it looks like you got a long way to go
Can't complain about radio and how radio is not playing your
Real music but you ask the real if they playing y'all and they saying no
Them broke dreams, them hoop dreams was just hope dreams
That's the way that I look at y'all when y'all talk to me like you know things
Weaklings like dope fiends
That will lie and tell ya they'll go clean
Don't really look like they eating great but they tellin' y'all that that's protein
And them smoke screens, looking around like who's stopping us
They could never stop destiny if I make a wish then its not for luck
The minute something get popular you know hyper beast will start popping up
So whats stopping y'all if you're stopping us a hater's lifestyle has really gotta suck

[Hook]
