(yeaa)
I'm poppin bottles of patron (poppin bottles of patron)
All night long (chamillionaire and bobby v, we in vip)
Its on, its on (hah chamillitary mayne)

[Bobby Valentino]
I don't normally drink but tonite I'm gon
Gone off that rosay, gone off that patron
I'm so gone (baby)
I'm tryna wash my problems away (jus for the day)
Had too much to drink i won't say I'm drunk
But i think i drank a lil too much patron
I'm so gone (baby)
I'm tryna wash my problems away (jus for the day)

[Chamillionaire]
They mite say I'm such a flirt, lipstick on my neck and shirt
Chicks all up in vip, on my neck like its dessert
Said i was at work, and thats really where i was at first
Now I'm out with her and she tryna make my pockets hurt
Any drink that you prefer, any drink that you prefer
Knew that that will work, been a playa ever since my birth
Money is a curse, but i always chase the money first
Wonder why these girls, keep on askin what my necklace worth

Made a bunch of money, gotta lotta cars
Gotta lotta groupies that wanna be involved
I could have em all, but my life ain't gonna change
Cuz my problems still around the corners waitin
I put my cd on, now my money long
Mayne i shoulda known, my haterz woulda grown
And no i normally don't, but tonite i need a drank
So I'm in the club like what you drinkin

[Bobby Valentino]
I don't normally drink but tonite I'm gon
Gone off that rosay, gone off that patron
I'M so gone (baby)
I'm tryna wash my problems away (jus for the day)
Had too much to drink i won't say I'm drunk
But i think i drank a lil too much patron
I'm so gone (baby)
I'm tryna wash my problems away (jus for the day)

[Chamillionaire]
They mite say I'm such a flirt, lipstick on my neck and shirt

Chicks all up in vip, dancing in their mini skirts
Lookin at them curves, baddest woman in the universe
I'm jus tellin her, i need you to be my passenger
Haterz gettin on my nerves, haterz gettin on my nerves
And they better learn, they gon always get what they deserve
Money is a curse, but not havin money is the worst
I'll get back to work, but I'm bout to sip this henney first

Said it ain't trickin if you jus spend it
Imma run outta dough in a minute
Every chick sayin she independent
Starin at the diamonds all in my pendent
I'm not offended
Still tryna find out what her friend is
She tryna find out where my benz is
I'm so glad i got a tenda
Its time to get it
Tell me when the last time that you've been
With a playa this cool, I bet he isn't
All eyes on me like a witness
Told her i didn't
Drink it, yee i really meant it
And everybody is all up in my business
And I'm hopin this Henny help me forget it

[Bobby Valentino]
I don't normally drink but tonite I'm gon
