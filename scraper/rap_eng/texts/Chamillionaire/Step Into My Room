That ain't telling me, you
Got a perfect shape so won't you turn around, baby
I wanna picture, how you look in the nude
Looking at you, to see if it's true and I'm impressed
Step, into my room
Girl you know it's only grown folks allowed, baby
This for them ladies, that be banging that Screw
Banging that Screw it's just me and you, we having sex

[Chamillionaire]
This goes out to my ladies in Little Rock, that don't lay on no little cock
That'll rock that little Postropedic, till the springs in the middle pop
Listen to R&B, but she listen to Screw a lot
Treated cock like a lollipop, she gon taste every little drop
Fly to Thaila, will go live just try to
With tight pants, so she could show off the spine behind her
She fine but finer, is the dime beside her
Lost a friend but Jennady, and ain't trying to find her
You're not minor, so lil' mama I'm gonna name you
Queen Koopa for the night, tonight I'm gonna claim you
Picture your leg lifted, at an acute angle
Hitting all the degrees of your Assossole's triangle
Your my angel, would you mind if I kissed your design
Put my hands on your behind, while I'm dicking you down
Help you reach your climax, hit the switches and clown
Liquids glistening off your spine, water trickling down
Yeah she dries off, after soaking the skin with soap
And then motion in media approaching and lotion, her skin with notion then
I'm focusing, hoping to get her soaked again
Hoping to get her wet as the ocean, that men be floating in
I'm coaching and hoping, she'll let the show begin
Hoping she'll let me open, and poke it up in the open and
I'm just joking and, getting all in emotion and
Going in, know this man

[Hook]
A playa could, fill you with drank and dro
Fill up your tank some mo', and give you some drank to po'
But I'm really hood, I ain't exchanging do'
I ain't gon save her no, I make her change her clothes
I really should, be a DJ fa sho
Beat up and change the flow, and screw it and bang it slow
You feeling good, after I take you home
After I make you moan, but don't get too comfortable

[Chamillionaire]
It ain't no need to be alarmed, shh.. baby be calm
I got that key to get you warm, know how to turn you on
I swear when I turn you on, I won't disturb your mom
Fluids flowing through your body, got you burning warm
Go on let me slide inside, I love the way that you ride
Know you feeling the vibe, by the screw music I provide
I turn the tune up, two days before June 29th
A little faster slower, only one way to decide
You damn right it feel good, let's get this understood
I'ma show you I can control you, while I'm gripping my wood
You don't mess with other ladies, but I wish that you would
Cause a naked lady would look good, sitting on top of your hood
You don't complain, bout all them other chicks I be having
Cause you be helping me grab em, your jewelry made by Davin
And them heffers be babbling, but they don't have what you having
Face down and your ass erect, popped up imagine
How we could switch and do it fast, sometimes we do it slow
When I'm in it you don't complain, cause I'm working it like a pro
Mean you tipping on a mission, gotta go snatch that cash
When I get back to the pad, I'ma wax that ass
Rubbing lotion on your frame, the next night we do the same
Got you stripping with your top missing, now you know I'm bout to bang
My body and your frame, until tomorrow once again
Causing women are the same, it's just a different type of slang

[Hook]
That ain't telling me, you
Got a perfect shape so won't you turn around, baby
I wanna picture, how you look in the nude
Looking at you, to see if it's true and I'm impressed
Step, into my room
Girl you know it's only grown folks allowed, baby
This for them ladies, that be banging that Screw
Banging that Screw it's just me and you, we having sex
