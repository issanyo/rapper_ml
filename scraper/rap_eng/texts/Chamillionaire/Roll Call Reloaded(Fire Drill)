[Intro]
Chamilitary Mayne! (Fire Drill)
Chamilitary Mayne!! (Fire Drill)
You already know who it is - Major Pain (Fire Drill)
Cause I stay bringing the majors pain (More fire!)
Hold up, right now class is in session
So what we need to do is, run a fire drill real quick
Y'all know the routine (Fire Drill)
Stop, drop, now (Chamilitary boy!)
Stop, drop, now (I run this!)
Aye!

[Verse 1]
They told me "Koopa you the best," and then I said "I know!"
It's the Mixtape Messiah show so here it go part fo'
Revenge is a dish that is best served cold
So I walked into the kitchen and made them turn off the stove
How the heck you asking me whether or not I'm the real
I been terrorizing y'all way before I ever got a deal
Backyard a little bigger than a soccer field
I been on so many beaches, I forgot how socks should feel
Album coming, put the King on your gift list
Rip your pink slip, cause I'm to sick to be dismissed
"F" what you think, I know I'm lyrically gifted
Like the kid that opened up a rap booklet on Christmas
You win it then you lose it, they just say that's life
Then you pull out that Ferrari, then they say "That's nice!"

[Hook]
The industry is saying that boy got skills (Fire Drill)
And the streets is saying that boy so real (Fire Drill)
Give that boy a tracka nd that boy Chamill' (Fire Drill)
Always give you somethin that you boys gon' feel (Fire Drill)
"Gotta give you somethin that you boys gon' feel (Fire Drill)" [X4]

[Verse 2 - Imitating Young Jeezy]
Yeah!
Still in the streets, still sticking to the plan (plan)
All this ice on me, got a frosted out hand (hand)
White coloured Lam' lookin like a snowman (man)
Hundred karat chain, see the neck, they like "Damn"
Cheah, y'all know me
Eff the industry, I'm still the same old G
Serve to the streets till you lames O.D
Mixtapes like crack, the next thang's on me

[Verse 3 - Imitating Jim Jones]
Some of them be talking but snitch is what we call 'em (snitches)
I be gettin gwop way from Houston down to Harlem (Harlem)
We twenty deep if it's a problem
Tuckin' in they jewelry cause they thinkin we gon' rob 'em
And you know how we be mobbin
Police lady talking bout the trouble that we causing (keep it moving)
You gon' have to keep it moving darling
And we gon' keep on doing what we doing and we ain't pausin'

[Verse 4 - Imitating Lil Wayne]
Yeah! Young Millionaire, they can't deal with this swagger
Feel the banana, will squeeze the hammer
I see your forehead, it will see the handle
Will eat your money, will feed your ama-
Ammo, Rambo, I will enjoy
I am nutting if she's slutty just like Almond and Joy
Programmed to kill, get beat, I destroy
Whatever to get the money, little duffle bag boy

[Verse 5 - Imitating Plies]
Dope boy, gotta feel me, I'm real tight
Doing what I really say I do in real life
Check out the chain homie, this some real ice
A hundred and fifty K for it, that's the real price
Bust it baby, wanna give me in her living room
Making music for the hustlers and the real goons
Let 'em know, album bout to hit 'em real soon
All you rappers gon' have to make a little room

[Verse 6  - Imitating E-40]
I don't know what the problem is, pockets thick as a hippopotamus (hippopotamus)
Breezy lookin in the dash of my drop top, tryna see what mileage is (the mileage is)
She done flunked about fifteen somethin colleges
Your opinion is irrelevant as a XXL columnist
So tell that breezy she better be a skater (skater)
She's best to get up out of here cause the pimp like me won't date her
Uhhh, I'm a pimp, you the one that paid her
Pulling off in my scrape and it black on black like I'm Darth Vader

[Verse 7 - Imitating B.G.]
Hopped off the porch and homie didn't like that
So now I roll solo and don't even like cats
Chain lookin frozen, I'm showing a icepack
Loyal to the streets, I hand you the mic back
I put down my pistol and whodi you get slapped
But it ain't even fun cause I know he won't fight back
Can't leave the streets, they love me just like crack
I'm like Uncle Sam, yeah homie, I like that

[Verse 8  - Imitating Rick Ross]
Other rappers just be having million dollar thoughts
I'm a rapper that can pull a million out my vault
Do it like boss, don't matter what the cost
White on white Phantom, sittin fat, I gotta floss

[Verse 9 - Imitating Rich Boy]
Nobody selling that, record labels falling back
Back off in these streets, show 'em how to get a stack
Show these other rappers and these fun trappers how to act
Throw-throw some D's on it and put some more on top of that

[Verse 10 - Imitating Snoop Dogg]
She approached me, I ain't approach her
I had a forty-ounce on my coaster
You know I want to hit that west coaster
Candy car blue, that's the hue on my roadster
And the same color on my low-low
Got a couple homies with that chronic for the low-low
For sho' though, and I ain't with the snitchin, that's a no-no
That's why I'm riding solo and I'm lookin out for popo

[Verse 11 - Imitating Bun B]
I'm off the metre, they want me to let 'em know what's the deal (deal)
Cause I'm a Texas player that's only gon' keep it trill (trill)
You ain't gotta look for no longer, the trill is here (here)
That mean the falsifyin' and fakers gon' disappear (disappear)
Probably shouldn't give a trill rapper the mic
Cause he gon' kick that realness and trill ish that they like (like)
And the street credibility gon' match to the hype (hype)
Talking bout you keep it gangsta, only half of you might

[Verse 12 - Imitating The Game]
I'm an N.W.A., no manners and bad grammar
Surrendering for what? No waiving the bandanna
Tim the Tool Man how I handle the damn hammer
Try to punk me and I'm breaking that man camera
Just tell MTV to send a doctor the bill
And if the bill make it there, you'll need a doctor for real
Keep a chopper on his seat to keep a watch on my wheels
Mashing in the Lamborghini like the cops on my heels

[Verse 13 - Imitating Jay-Z]
I ain't even writing homie, I just press record
And know you'll say is great before I make it to the course
Hear your little voice tryna make a little noise
Till I let you little boys see my picture in the Forbes
Tell Forbes to get it straight
Cause they gon' have to account for what I do with the tapes
I never bounce a check, I don't even bounce to the bank
G5 everywhere, get a million miles on a tank

[Hook]
The industry is saying that boy got skills (Fire Drill)
And the streets is saying that boy so real (Fire Drill)
Give that boy a track and that boy Chamill' (Fire Drill)
Always give you somethin that you boys gon' feel (Fire Drill)
"Gotta give you somethin that you boys gon' feel (Fire Drill)" [X4]

[Outro - Imitating The Dream]
Shawty rock to the beat for your boy
Shaw-ty, do it
Ay-ay, got a fleet full of toys
Whole bunch of blue whips
Gettin cheddar, cheddar, cheddar
I be gettin cheddar, cheddar, cheddar
You know I be grindin, grindin, grindin daily
Grindin, grindin, grindin daily
