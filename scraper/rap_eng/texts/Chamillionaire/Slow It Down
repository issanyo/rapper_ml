[Hook:]
She say she love the way I take control
First in slow motion, then I speed it up and stroke it now
Slow it down, slow it down, slow it down
Now switch it up now

She said I always was the best before
With the slow motion but the difference is I'm focused now
Slow it down, slow it down, slow it down
Then speed it up now

[Verse 1:]
Speed it up, uh
I got a genie in a bottle you can rub on
I call it Henny, it'll help you get your love on
This is the closest that she gettin' to a love song
Pull out my dick and tell her "Welcome to the love zone"
In general I'm a general to you lieutenants
Landlord, bad women are my new tenants
Runnin' round causing trouble like the new Dennis
The menace in your girl mouth like her new dentist
Uh, get a cavity check
You little Internet nerds don't have any sex
I come and get her in the Rover, the 'Caddy, the Lex
She take a pic I bet I'm gettin' her panties to stretch
Yep, I hope your making it on my list
You'll never meet another player as cold as this
The second that you ever let me control your hips
I'm deadly and as venomous as a cobra kiss
Switch!

[Verse 2: slowed down]
Slow it down, known to spit
If that's your girl better grab her quick
Keep telling me that she the baddest chick
That translates to she wants my magic stick
Grab the whip, slab a kit
Wood in my slab like a cabinet
Trying to trap me I ain't having it
I keep a cap on my head like a graduate, trick
Graduation, congratulations
Beat turned up so the slab was shakin'
Police nah I don't add the bacon
Plenty of the grams that I'm tabulating
Gravitation, on the rise
Looking for a chick with some swollen thighs
Piece in my draws really oversized
If they told you it's not

[Verse 3: normal]
Then they told ya lies
Switch it up in slow mo
I ain't sweating no ho
Krusty like the clown ya man looking like a bozo
She can get the bozack, he can get the 4 4
Burn off in my whip while hitting switches like a cholo
Superfast and slow mo
I be in the zone though
Off universal still creeping on the low low
Lizard for the logo tricking is a no-no
Me and her will kick it like some ninjas at a dojo (Wah!)
Uh, she bounce on it like a pogo stick
While I stick to the script on you lames
I always been the posterchild of grippin' the grain
I always been the president of getting the change
The flow switching the change
Then I switch it to slow
Ya can't get in her mind I already got in the do'
To be specific I'm living the way I live in my flow
When now they know I'm the player your woman getting to know
Let's go

[Hook]

[Break:]
Hmmmmmm this type of love so off the chain
Cause I ain't gotta remember your name
And I ain't gotta buy you anything
I'm a do it like a pro baby
I'm a take it slow cause you know that you ain't my dame

Don't think just cause you looking good
That I'm a be your ticket out the hood
Girl I think there's something you should know
You can't be my number 1
You can be my number 4 and I think that we should take it slow

[Verse 4: slowed down]
All my broads stay in search of facts
That mean a real man that can work the stacks
Me and Ben Franklin the birth of macks
Wanna double date he the perfect catch
Get a hair cut then reverse the cap
Took off the top, then convert the back
Black red bottoms with the skirt to match
I ain't talking bout her that refer to 'lac
I don't ride on no teenage wheels
Open my trunk you'll see 8 kills
She got curves but she in heels
Say that he her's, but she ain't his
I created the term C.O.D
I ain't seen a real rapper since P.A.T
I ain't heard a real rapper since P.A.C
Some of these other boys cool but he ain't me

[Hook]
