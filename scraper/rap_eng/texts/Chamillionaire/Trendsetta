[Chorus - Chamillionaire] (Repeat 2x)
Livin' the life of a straight trendsetta
What you do good, I always do better
While you dream bout makin money
I make all the cheddar
Will I stop? Never

[Chamillionaire]
-Ever
When I open up the trunk it look so sweet
Presto I'm changin' Antwan to open Sesame Street
I'ma roll model for all geeks, they walk up and gimme dap
So many screens up in the slab, I'm drivin' a computer lab
But this ain't no algebra class
This is get the cash class
This is, slap his ass if a nigga make you mad class
This is gimme all of my dough up-front don't give me half class
This is "I'll pay you later", ha don't make me laugh class
I be the realest rapper to out rap a non-rappin' rapper
Or the realest rapper to ever slap a high-cappin'-cappa
What I'm really tryin' to say is you don't really wanna stare
Haters take more naps then when ya brother cut ya mothers hair
I'm wearing a Roc-A-Wear, she wanna see what under there
But pull ya missin' a pair of my brothers un-washed underwear
I got hall of fame and change that yall boys used to have
Pull up in jag, and make every so-called baller in Houston mad
Officer he was boot-leggin', so I had to abuse his ass
Didn't really wanna use a gat, and catch a case so I used a bat
Might as well tell the judge to put me in jail and raise bail
But I'm as dope as the dope on scale in drug-sale
I won't choke a female but hell I know I'll choke a mail
Got's to be provoked to sale
We thuggin' ain't hard to tell
I'll never let a
Wanna be cheddar getta, get on my cheddar
So better get a damn life, Chamillion's a trendsetta

[Chorus]
