(talking)
Duke E Loud, Lil' Flip, you see what we doing
You see what we driving, you see how we living
You see the rims spinning, you see the platinum grill
Still man in it, uh uh

[Lil' Flip]
I pulled up in a jag (you see it)
Everybody know I got Texas cash (you see it)
I'm like Juve, throwing up a soldier rag (you see it)
In H-Town, I throw up a Clover flag (you see it)
On T.V. I'm still leaning to the left (you see it)
Got a deal, but I didn't sign with Def (you see it)
Got a deal with Sony, now we richer (you see it)
Look me up I'm in The Source, see my picture (you see it)
I got hoes just coming to my shows (you see it)
I got niggas just running to my do' (you see it)
You see everything we smoke is endo (you see it)
It's a truck, but it's made by Benzo (you see it)
I'm Lil' Flip, I'm from the Dirty Dirty South (you see it)
I got about fifty grand in my mouth (you see it)
I represent for my nigga named Screw (you see it)
Some niggas claim red, some claim blue (you see it)

(Chorus)
Nothing less than 20 thousand on my wrist (you see it)
You got cars in your yard but none like this (you see it)
Candy frame, I'ma swing on twenty inch (you see it)
I ain't got to tell these hoes that I'm a pimp (you see it)
Be banging the Jaguar behind the tent (you see it)
Hydro chronic smoking know you smell the scent (you see it)
Got my heater under my Iceberg fit (you see it)
I'm the shit, I got these hatas pissed you see it, you see it

[Lil' Flip]
You got a Cardier, but it's little (you see it)
Look at mine, I got X's in the middle (you see it)
I go to sleep on a Iceberg bed (you see it)
I'm feeling smart, cause I always get head (you see it)
I might ride candy red, or black (you see it)
If it's called a Escalade, it's a Lac (you see it)
If you sitting on twenties, then they shine (you see it)
If it ain't endo, we call it pine (you see it)
Down here everybody got gold (you see it)
Still flipping, cause we all got hoes (you see it)
Still rich, cause we all got shows (you see it)
Couple of friends, but we all got foes (you see it)
Down here,Lil' Flip run the South (you see it)
Owe me money, there's a gun in your mouth (you see it)
Want a show, you better send my deposit (you see it)
As far as Sucka Free camp, go I got it (you see it)

(Chorus)

[Chamillion]
I pump my breaks, my rims keep spinning in place (you see it)

[Lil' Flip]
Don't worry, we ain't got bad breaks (you see it)

[Chamillion]
This frozen water, got my gums feeling numb (you see it)

[Lil' Flip]
I'm like Nas, cause I know I got a gun (you see it)

[Chamillion]
Got a thug girl, a slugs hit me brain freeze (you see it)

[Lil' Flip]
I'm like Alicia, cause we move the same keys

[Chamillion]
Niggas know I got more dope, than Homer (you see it)

[Lil' Flip]
I'm getting head from your gal, in the sauna (you see it)

[Chamillion]
My strap's sticking in my lap, its never hitting (you see it)

[Lil' Flip]
I got some millions, but I'm still on a mission (you see it)

[Chamillion]
Chamillionaire dot com, tatted on my arm (you see it)

[Lil' Flip]
The Screwed Up Click, written in platinum on my charm (you see it)

[Chamillion]
I'm bending corners in the Lac, I'm gripping grain
This that Dirty Dirty, what we do is swang
We gone ball, and we gone never be ashamed
Platinum versus, platinum teeth and platinum chains

(Chorus)

You see it - 4x
