[Verse 1]
Who are you to have any clout, or have any doubt about my potential?
You ain't working for the police, you'll never get to check my credentials
Took a look at my blueprint, tried to copy me like a stencil
But they can only be number two, I hope you fakers run out of pencils
So presidential, like Kennedy in that Continental
Except it's like I switched vehicles and didn't let 'em see what I'm hopping into
When they see you get popular, then they popping up to come pop your mental
They always tell me that money talks, and my conversation ain't confidential
Who said that I can't eat, that's something that I can't digest
I'm 'bout to eat like I closed my eyes and this meal in front of me God blessed
Only guilty of being dope, I'm pleading like its no contest
Cause if you think that they've got it locked, then that lock to me is like Loch Ness
Y'all talking 'bout me way more than me, and what do you think that say 'bout you?
In your mind I keep popping up, my nickname should'a been deja vu
Been here for too long for you to say I'm through, I stay blessed, I ain't even say hatchoo
My city and state will say I'm true, cause I be doing everything I say I do

[Hook]
Hop in the drop, no time to wait
No, I know you see me hustling every day
They know they not, they know they ain't
So, they say how fast I'm going isn't safe
They tell me stop, pump on your brakes
No, I just keep driving, keep driving straight
They tell me stop, pump on your brakes
No, I just keep driving, keep driving straight

[Verse 2]
I've been running this for forever, so listen close if you're new to this
Every day is a motion picture, my calendar is a movie list
Introduce myself as a rapper, then put the guap before groupie chicks
In the coupe and I'm riding like I can't let the top of that roof exist
See I was local, not hot at all, told myself that I gotta ball
Hit the streets with that Houston heat, help you get your mind right with Paul
Every verse is just like the law, I'm the person they Skype a call
Want a verse, they ask what it's worth, I'm like Koopa really don't like ya, naaaw
Never sold you no lame gimmick, I never sold you no fake image
Don't disrespect me and you don't you ever put me and them in the same sentence
The same menace that taught ya hustle, I start the engine, get out the way
If you're really hoping my reign fall, then write a rain check, cause it's not today

[Hook]

[Post-Hook]
Keep driving, keep driving, keep driving straight
Keep driving, keep driving, keep driving straight
Money all on my plate, they keep telling me wait
I ain't taking no breaks, I just hop in my ride and drive
I ain't tryin'a be late, I'm just tryin'a be great
I can't tell you my fate, just let me know if you're down to ride

[Outro]
Oh, yeah, yeah, I just hop in my ride and drive
