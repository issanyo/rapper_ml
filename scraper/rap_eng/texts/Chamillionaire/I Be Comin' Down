[Chorus - Rasaq]
Ehh-Ehh, I be comin' down
Uh-Ey (Uh-Ey), I be comin' down
Ehh-Ehh (Uh-Yeah), I be comin' down
Ehh-Ehh, I be comin' down
Ehh-Ehh, I be comin' down
I be comin' down, (1 for the 44) I be comin' down (2 for the Northside)
Ehh-Eww I be comin' down

[Verse: Rasaq]
Excuse me, polo when I be dressed
Rose gold around my neck, fingers throwin' up my set ehh-ehh
Pourin' up the cut, open up the trunk
Strip out the inside man, I'm showin' up on buck (Aoww!)
I'm so cool, the paint so wet
Chrome women on my hood look like she divin' in a pool
I be ridin' with the tool, I be draped in diamond jewels
When it's drama I'ma dummy, look don't make me turn to fool
Them other boys cool, but they ain't me
I'm the throwdest rhyme boy that ya eyes gon' see
Uh, My chain look like a box of cereal
Lucky Charms on my arms look like some frosted material
Yeah..I want 300 M
You want the kind you sit in, I want the kind you spend in
Paint changin' blendin', rims swangin' spinnin'
Til' them thangs is bendin', leavin' stains and drippin'
I be comin' down, boys say what does that mean
But they soon get the picture when they see them TV screens
..These boys ain't messin' with the flow
Nigga, I'm the issh, like you messed up on the floor
Ha, you know the flow is so professional
Cham' is the next to go, that means that I'm the next to blow!
Before this, we been dressin' 24's
We put buttons on our rims, when we steppin' out the door

[Chorus - Rasaq]
Ehh-Ehh, I be comin' down
I be comin' down
Ehh-Eww (Uh-Yeah), I be comin' down
Ehh-Ehh, I be comin' down
Ehh-Ehh, I be comin' down
I be comin' down, I be comin' down
Ehh-Eew I be comin' down
