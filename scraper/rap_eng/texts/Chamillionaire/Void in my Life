[Hook]
When I look back at my life, I realize-realize something ain't right
I'm missing you Lord, in my life make it right
I got something to decide, just wanna make-wanna make everything right
Cause there's a huge void, a huge void in my life make it right

[Verse 1]
I'm staring up at the Pope, it soak it up while he spoke it
Mesmerized and repeated, like he the author that wrote it
The broads are the ones I love, just don't wanna be the corporate
So waiting for death to approach this, take the time to say no sis
I don't hate ya, for having these little seeds
At 17, best believe they're a beautiful breeze
Of fresh air when their's nothing else, I usually need
Just a smile look at em now, hoping you just believe
And my broad been in place forever, I'm gone but I'm chasing cheddar
Been gone could of kept it going, with a poem or a basic letter
But naw I just hate to tell her, try hard but I didn't let her
The groupies get at your boy, but you're my Cinderella
Look girl we can make it better, but there's a gift and a curse
While you healing a nigga feelings, your's are usually hurt
It ain't amount of cash on Earth, to match what you really worth
Know your turf has been the church, that's where you put in work
And you put in overtime, because you know the sign
And most danger that I've been lately, rap is mo' than rhymes
But you still hold me down, I'mma do way mo' this time
Got some time that I need to manage, girl you know that's right
And that's speaken like a true deacon, cause even to see you sleeping
That comfortabally ain't enough for me, anything that you needing
I'll cease anything that squeaks, and cease any sink that leaks
Ain't nothing gon interrupt, your sleep deep into them sheets and peep

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
How your father call the police, have your mama put in the jail
When the arguments always started, and ended up in a cell
Hard to it was the thought of this, ring that you use to wear
As I darted out the apartment, and pawned it to get the bail
Argument after argument, drama wasn't hitting well
Target it ain't no harm in it, smart so I didn't tell
God that it was the hardest, yeah life was a living hell
Spent part of it steady dodging it, charging off in the trails
Father say he a Muslim, your mama say she a Christian
The Bible or the Koran, which one would you be picking
The cards are in your palm, ain't really no use in tripping
Be true to the one you choose, ain't really no use in switching
Yeah they gon have to be mad at us, choice is something I had to trust
Standing up when I had enough, for my blessings not adding up
Take too many things for granted, right after that metal gedal bust
Somebody's life is missing, that's when the spirit grabbing us

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
A religion is what you missing, someone tell me how can it
Make people panic, mention God and all the weak people vanish
Take God your woman and your family, even your own life for granted
Until you slanted on the planet, with your face in the granite
And I won't have it, I donâ€™t want to see my culture divided
So I decided to remind it, there's a choice and provide it
So put your ego to the side, soon as you standing beside it
Raise your right hand, and let the spirit know it's invited
Don't need to fight it, I just wanna make it right 'fore they bury me
Cause the truth is like therapy, plus my conscience is tearing me
Into pieces as deadly was dealt, was not even fair to me
To the soldiers that passed in the game, we missing you terribly
Thank my family especially, in my mind like telepathy
Staying humble's the recipe, keep my faith and he blessing me
I use the energy left in me, to make sure they respecting me
Walk the steps of my destiny, like I know he protecting me
I'm a leader, believe the people won't get to see less of me
No they won't see the death of me, or no police arresting me
I live life so successfully, and just show em the best of me
On another level mentally, this position was meant for me

[Hook]
