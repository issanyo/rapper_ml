Color Changin' Click..

(*gun shot*)

The baddest click of all
Northside blowing up, they can't stop us

[Hook]
I got the baddest click
I know I told you niggas once, I ain't gotta say it twice
Black, Puerto Rican and Spanish chicks
All wanna hop in the slab with me, and roll with me tonight
Your nigga, is getting agged and pissed
He trying to say, that he ain't having it at al
But your pussy, is the baddest clit
Color Changin' Click boy, and my mission is to cock back and destroy

[Rasaq]
My click is bad, thoed off the dome
Sick with the pad, rolling on chrome in the whip or the slab
Despicable cash, mouth look like invisible glass
And you girl just laugh, at your pitiful ass
Can't no one use the same words, and syllables as
My little cool ass, jamming a Screw cause I said a little bit too fast
I'm skipping through class, flipping through cash
With little du-rags I'm a little too bad, I spit at you fags
The pistol will blast, at your critical mash
You a little too slow, well that's a little too bad
On the mic I don't back down, I clap at you whack clowns
Bury rappers under the stage, dress the mic in a black gown
Get slap and sat down, with verbs and fast nouns
No gat to be found, when the FEDs searching pat down
It's Koopa and Rasaq, in the booth or in a drop
We the baddest click, we hot and you not
We rap and you talk, we floss and you watch
We pass and jock, we get props you do not nigga

Yeah, yeah..

[Chamillionaire]
I step up in a building on my head, like I'm too gutter to speak
I'm gutter I cheat, every week with a slut or a freak
Building-building on my head, like I'm too gutter too speak
I'm gutter I cheat, every week with a slut or a freak
Build-build-building on my head, like I'm too gutter to speak
I'm gutter I cheat, every week with a slut or a freak
I love her physique, Koopa can put the nut on her cheek
Her butt or the sheet, or be slow with it and nut on her teeth
The other's a treat, when they see how I cuddle the heat
Hakim scheme for the hew, or the color of a leaf
Green, king of the team and now my brother's the Chief
Chamillionaire.com Don, they say the borther's a geek
But no, the site got one point five million hits
Check my track record, I drop one point five million hits
Some chicks are like crooks, your cheddar will get took
I'm six inches taller, I keep a lot of cheddar then a foot
She mad cause my verses and hook, are better than her looks
I step up in U-Face, with a school sweater and some books
No scooting, just wanted to see who want it with me
When to come to learning to add, I teach my brother for free
In school I never wanted a A, or wanted a B
I wanted a G, now all the G's wanna be me
Hold up my wheels are ferris, my rims the rarest
He dick down airport chicks, might catch him in Paris
Make 'em feel embarrassed, like she just did an appearance
On a Girls Gone Wild video, and got caught by her parents
No friend to marriage, so she gon be my enemy
If she wanna marry me, I'll let her down gently
The way that he spend it, he must be kin to a Kennedy
The President poster child, got paper you'll never see it's the King

All mighty King Koopa, bow down Ghetto Status mayn

[Chamillionaire]
Hmmm, we swanging foreigns
Rims spinning and the paint, gon color change fa sho
When the game's, getting boring
Rasaq and Chamillionaire, will come and save the show
Doing shows, and touring
We ain't signed to a major, but got major do'
Hmmmm-mmmm-mmmm
Color Changin' Click, let's go
