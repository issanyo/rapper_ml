[Intro: Chamillionaire]
Everything will change tomorrow, just wait
Everything we had seems different lately
Everything at first is always so great
But it’s never enough, never enough

[Hook:Angel]
You get up and then you fall flat
Even when you give your all back
They try to tell you where your heart’s at
Someone tell me what you call that
I believe, I believe it’s never enough
I believe it’s never, never enough
I believe it’s never, never enough
Never, never enough
Everything is never, never enough

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
I’m thinking about all of the people I went harder for
While I read the Holy Scripture like it’s Art of War
Pretty women and skinny dipping. Where the party boy?
Skipping the crib like I ain’t get to book it on this tour
If I wasn’t ready and never seen it all before
Probably keep a loaded weapon up in all my drawers
Cuz I know its people envious of marble floors
If everybody had the answers it would all be yours
Success could have ran from me, I said I woulda caught you
You coulda just be the person I'd open my arms to
It coulda been something said that I’d never respond to
Or you coulda just gave a reason for me to assault you
You coulda just worked it out with somebody you talk to
That coulda been something that someone else never taught you
You coulda been legendary if you had the heart to
That coulda been something that wouldn’t come back to haunt you
What's up

[Hook: Angel]
You get up and then you fall flat
Even when you give your all back
They try to tell you where your heart’s at
(They try to tell you where your heart’s at)
Someone tell me what you call that
I believe, (I believe)I believe it’s never enough
(It’s just never enough)
I believe it’s never, never enough
(It’s just never enough)
I believe it’s never, never enough
Never, never enough
Everything is never, never enough

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Tell em you won't do it they’ll say that it’s foolish pride
Pour your heart out and they actin’ like someone lied
When you stand up for something they’ll treat you like someone died
But if you don’t stand up for nothing just call it a homicide
Told me to fear God. Now tell me. is that coward?
Named the kid X a symbol of black power
You just plottin’ the schemin' remain in that towel
Lactose intolerant to you dames who that sour
Do anything for the money but tell me what does it mean
If money’s everything, get it and tell me what else it brings
Gepetto pull out that metal. Which one in you crew will sing?
You puppets You better duck it or learn who pulling the strings

[Bridge: Chamillionaire]
Send a kite to federal through the bing
They sell their souls for soles of Jordans and foolish things
Careful, the truth stings
I know that you had a dream but ain’t no Martin Luther King’s out on Martin Luther King

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Hold up, let someone tell me what you call that
Think you beneath em so they think they can walk on you like a doormat
The only way that I can solve that
Get on the beat, spit all this heat
Straight to the heart and get em all clapped
Cuz this apparently therapy
I’m hysterically laughing at anybody who thinking they could embarrass me
You live vicariously through the words that I’m inherently
Passing to y’all but I ain’t gotta do necessarily, no
Why should I bother? I know that I’m not your father
You’ll never become a baller, I never slept with your mama
You’ll never become Obama, you’ll never get any commas
You’ll never get anything in your life but plenty drama (what else)
I set the precedence from my lil seed
They cut me I'mma bounce back like I’m Shaheem Reid
Au revoir to all the enemies that I didn’t need
See, real recognize real and that’s why I can’t see no one but me

Never enough
Never enough
Never enough
Never enough

[Bridge: Chamillionaire]
Send a kite to federal through the bing
They sell their souls for soles and Jordans and foolish things
Careful, the truth stings
I know that you had a dream but ain’t no Martin Luther King’s out on Martin Luther King
