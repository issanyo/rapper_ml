[Intro]
I don't really know if it's dead or alive
They called for an ambulance, they say one of them won't be able to make it until March 27th
But in the meantime I'll give it a check up

[Hook x2]
Hip Hop just died here's a warning (somebody ring the alarm)
Hip Hop just died here's a warning (somebody ring the alarm)
Hip Hop just died here's a warning
That revenge is coming

[Bridge]
Man I don't even know if Hip Hop dead but I do know that some of the biggest retail stores is going out of business. Record sales ain't doing what they used to do. Remember when you used go 4-5 million sold, now everybody having trouble to go gold man. There's a lot good music coming out the South but a lot of nonsense coming out the South. But I can't blame no artist, I blame corporate America for the downfall of rap

Hip Hop should die before I'm great
I'mma do more than just murder a mixtape
I'mma do more than just murder a mixtape
I'mma do more than just murder a mixtape

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Pollution I smell that in the breeze
But let's try not get mad at the trees
Tell 'em all not to get mad at the leaves
Let's get mad at the idiots who planted the seeds
When it comes to mixtapes, I'm known as the Messiah
I influenced these other rappers to get tighter
Go to every label and murder the check writer
Whoever hired him we should pray he get fired
As soon as they kick 'em out in Broadway
Show'em how to make his Hip Hop the hard way
I bring the whole South with me
You should just call me
Yeah we can make a pi√±ata out of him all day
Yeah, and I ain't even finna be gentle
You can murder Salaam for sending me the instrumental
It ain't coincidental how they can get into were mental
Then the minute you see it they tell ya it was accidental
All rich rappers do is complain
Everybody arguing to be on top of the game
9 out 10 rap about coppin' them thangs
Or how the gat go BLAT BLAT BLAT when it bang
And it seem H-Town got the popular slang
Platinum grills everybody else copping the same (what)
Platinum grills everybody else copping the same
Then everybody run to that like it the populist thang
What is that man? Where the hell ya swagger at?
Who gon' be the first person to bring the old swagger back?
Doing what I do it seem boys mad at that
You a sharp homie where the hell were dagger at
I was a fan sitting up in the stands when it was
M-E-T-H-O-D MAN
Get a M-E-T-H-O-D for Cham
Rakim was still thinking of a master plan
And it worked, and now I'ma fit up in my place
Stay humble, stay focused, to show that I got grace
You better not point the burner to my face
Better load up the burner and then turn it to Myspace (preach)
The same rapper that die hard
Bruce Willis with a vest under the Izod
Wanna beat you? man I ain't gotta try hard
You getting beat by the internet in you Ipod
The label don't want you be Master P
Took the Master and put it right after P
Puppet master but I won't let them master me
You an idiot if your giving up your masters free
Corporate America is F'n up the rap game
Why we always argue 'bout which rapper got the fat chain
You real gangsta you pulling out your gat mayne
The real gangsta whoever on your rap name
Like Busta said "You should give a performance"
That's the truth us rappers shouldn't try to avoid it
If you're married to the game, go ahead and divorce it
Especially if it's rap, we ain't even enjoying it
Yeah, I am not going to point a K at a magazine
Because of what somebody say in a magazine
I could pull out my chain yelling Bodda Bling
Or on a G4 plane sitting by the wing
Telling you the leather feel good don't it
For 50 thou you'll have a real good moment
The plane is landed by the pilot that flown it
I am not an idiot cuz I'm trying to own it
Little kids look at me and say "You the best"
1.3 million in the U.S
Some label exec getting a new desk
I get an award, they tell me that I'm too blessed
Honestly it just excited my family
I just hide the medicine inside of the candy
Get cured by the music blasting out of your Camry
If not, I'll hide the medicine inside of your brandy
Cuz I know that ya'll boys gotta be drunk
To think that Chamillionaire gon' be an industry punk
I'm an in-the-streets prob, you will get stumped
Get criss-crossed off when ya get jumped
Some of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this
Some of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this
Some of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this
Some of them try to rhyme but they cain't
Cuz I'm the miggidi miggidi mack that stack the plat plaques
But rap ya so wack so I'm back to spit crack
March 27th I'm back and that's fact
So rappers that can't rap get ready cuz it's a rap
