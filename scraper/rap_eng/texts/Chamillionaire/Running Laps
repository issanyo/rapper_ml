I can never slow down I'm running laps

Hold up, first of all who the hell you know that's this versatile
If you don't think that I can get back in my spot
I don't think that you gonna make it into work tomorrow
Or church tomorrow I murk em all I'm on top of the paper like cursive drawn
You know I'll be the first to be a curse to ya'll
Somebody better go and give that black hearse a call

Cause I promise that I'll kill it
While you sitting back on that sofa
I'm trying to keep the straps in that holster
And I would rather chase the stacks and not chocha
And they stay mad while I'm grinning cause I'm doing what they didn't and they losing while I'm winning

I can never slow down I'm running laps

I don't just do it for the H town gotta do it all for my whole state now (state now state now)
I can never slow down I'm running laps
I don't just do it for the pay now gotta do it cause I wanna be great now (great now, great now)
I can never slow down I'm running laps
I can't stop I'll never laydown and you know the whole world is my playground (playground, playground)
Hey Hey Hey
All around the world then back to the tropics making Ben Franks get back in my pocket

Hope you don't think these cats finna stop this

I can never slow down I'm running laps

All around the world to connect the dough
I'm trying to tic tac toe X the dough (x the dough x the dough)
If you ain't trying to help me get the checks to grow I hope you get familiar with the exit door (exit door)
I came along way from being next to blow and moving mixtapes by the Texaco (texaco)
Ya past always gonna try to catch you though their sky miles couldn't get them out to Mexico
If you don't me then be the next to go, Shoot yourself Plaxico
Slow money like the meter in a slow cab
That ain't in the vocab
The reason every woman that I know mad
They say I travel way more than a nomad
And they know that when I'm showing up I'm showing up with no bag
It don't matter if you riding in coach or you riding in first
Some people got no class
Unlawful waste time realize what it will cost you

If you ain't showing money like a vault do

You better find somebody else to talk to
When I do it I'm a do it like a boss do
If you reppin my state then you aught to
Cause I'm a do it like I'm Mr Miyagi
And you ain't gonna deny me cause I'm the one that taught you

I don't just do it for the H town gotta do it all for my whole state now (state now state now)
I can never slow down I'm running laps
I don't just do it for the pay now gotta do it cause I wanna be great now (great now, great now)
I can never slow down I'm running laps
I can't stop I'll never laydown and you know the whole world is my playground (playground, playground)
Hey Hey Hey
All around the world then back to the tropics making Ben Franks get back in my pocket

Hope you don't think these cats finna stop this

These boys trying to act hollywood better act like ya'll know the real
I'm a give ya'll that cold shoulder let em see how my shoulder chill
I don't play games I'm so for real lend me your ear like Holyfield
I'll shoot your buzz up out the sky let's just call that overkill

Run away with it run away with it, try to say I'm not the one I'm ok with it
Cause I don't have to get an ok with it
Home-run I ain't never gonna base hit it
The people that will say the kid ain't did it
The people that can never say they did it
Don't see em why they acting like they get it
I see through em everybody opaque with it
(Opaque with it)
So fake with it beating on my chest bout to go ape with it
I don't chase no little dough it's no taste in it

And if we talking big dough let's bake with it
That's cake get it everyday is like a Jason skit
Terrorizing everything while I'm chasing it
Making a killing not the villain to me racing with

I don't just do it for the H town gotta do it all for my whole state now (state now state now)
I can never slow down I'm running laps
I don't just do it for the pay now gotta do it cause I wanna be great now (great now, great now)
I can never slow down I'm running laps
I can't stop I'll never lay down and you know the whole world is my playground (playground, playground)
Hey Hey Hey

Now you gotta go kill it (kill it)
Now you gotta come with it (with it)
Now it's time to go get it

I can never slow down I'm running laps
