[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Hold up stop the madness
I see the canvas that body looking like artwork
Every woman got hidden talent just searching for it like star search
That don't mean that my hard work ending up your broad purse
If that's the way that she rocking out then I'll show up after that concert
You accidentally fall into love like you tried to do it on purpose
Hope the one that you say the one is worth everything that you purchased
See I say that I'll never pay you can go and research this
And any woman that's on this earth that don't know her worth could be worthless
What about you you worth the tab
What about shoes you worth a bag
If every woman is worth half that might not be true but it's worth a laugh
Think back to last woman you think could ever run game on me
Make sure you don't hold ya breath while you trying to think up her name homie
The real say I look similar
Im plotting something more sinister
Its a cold world If that's your girl then my subzero might finish her
I run for the presi's like senators
Cuz they keep escaping like prisoners
She might have to wait if I'm feeling her
But she's acting like she ain't chilling huh

[Hook: D.A. & Chamillionaire]
Now you ain't gotta lie to kick it baby you ain't gotta lie
And convince yourself that you wouldn't love to live this life
You can say I ain't ya type/ but you now I'm right
Now I got ya second guessing and its looking like she might
Show love show love show love show love
Show love show love Just show love
Tonight she might show might show might show me some love
Got ya second guessing and its looking like she might show love

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
I know that you ain't no angel plus you ain't wearing no halo ohhh ohhh
Some pretty women get paid for but that ain't really my lane though nooo nooo
Might even drive her own Range Ro and look as pretty as J-Lo
I let her know that it ain't gold down at the end of that rainbow
You just trying to get done right we can start with just one night
You can say that you won't but we both know
You can't say no

[Hook]

[Bridge: D.A. & Chamillionaire]
Just show love show love ohhh
Can't pick up my phone because I'm in my zone my zone
And nothing can save you now nothing can save you now hmmm
Just leave the lights on just leave the lights on

[Verse 4: Chamillionaire]
It's a thin line between love and war
This a line that you can't ignore
You can say I took long enough but can't say that I ain't worth waiting
I won't say that it's your fault because one minute I don't call
Then the next minute I'm running to it and hopping in it like pole vault/
I ain't tryin' to take no loss I ain't saying I can't fail/
But many tried to stop me from shinning guess we can see that that went well/
Pardon my for my cockiness but my drop is looking so topless/
And I'm wondering of you really think that your woman bout to be opposite/

[Hook]
