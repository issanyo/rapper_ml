[Chamillionaire]
My cool is so cool, my smooth is so smooth
Whoo! Whoo! You in the presence of the... Chamillitary Mayne, Chamillitary Mayne
Let me repeat myself, you in the presence of the finest - Koopa!
The King Koopa, King Koopa, King Koopa, King Koopa
Oh, I'm feelin like Ali
I'mma always be the greatest, you can hate on me

Uh, uh, uh, I always stay on the flight, it's just the way I'm livin
That's what I'm doin tonight, I never say I'm chillin
Look how I get on the stage, ready to play the rhythm
While you repeating my words, huh plagiarism
A Rich Boy had to Throw Some D's up on the 'Llac
You call it stuntin but to me it's really more fact
Look in the seat, I know them haters wanna jack
Gotta hit 'em wit the shot, "hut" like a quarterback
John Madden, bomb madam, the car havin
You feelin like you a lumberjack in a log cabin
Feelin like you a lumberjack, Todd Davins
Look at all of the cherry wood that your boy grabbin
Yeah, and it's the rap game Texan
Cain't find a rapper that my stacks is less than
At least not in Texas, I know rap is stressin
Most of it is actin, I know rap is wrestlin
And you is so bam-bam-bigaloo
Lyrically killin 'em, I bam-bam with the fo'
Have a conversation with a Cham fan, it'll show
They'll tell you that Koopa is a mad man sent to flow (oh)
And I created a monster
Other record labels just creatin impostors
While I make that yellow stuff that's greater than pasta
Plenty of Cheddar Cheese baby, that's what I got for (got for)
The haters that be sayin that I never could
I'm guessing all of my music was never good
They scared of me, ask who I am, I tell 'em Suge
They scared of me, ask who I am, I tell 'em Boog-
Ie monster, haunt ya, your character is terrible
Your poodle, I'm terrier, I embarrass ya
Laugh and its more stereo, tell 'em the more the merrier
You can forget the menu cause I'mma order your burial
Who the best? You can call out Koopa
Sexual seduction, tell your broad I'll snoop her (snoop her)
Chicken noodle mayne, the car so suped up
Ladies rubbin on it like it's Kama Sutra

It's the King Koopa, King Koopa, King Koopa, King Koopa
Oh, I'm feelin like Ali
I'mma always be the greatest, you can hate on me
