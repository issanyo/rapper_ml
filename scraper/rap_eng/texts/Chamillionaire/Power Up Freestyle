Twinky-Deuce under the ship
So a Glock stuck to the hip
Chamillionaire, aww he sick

Scared of the dark, turn on the neons cuz I'm flostraphobic

Cuz my tires is on fire, when I pulled up on the dayton's
Ain't no need for debatin' I'm the Boss of the Hoss
When the Super King, Koopa's seen, trick it's off with ya blouse

Keep it tight get it right, it's the walking blizzard
