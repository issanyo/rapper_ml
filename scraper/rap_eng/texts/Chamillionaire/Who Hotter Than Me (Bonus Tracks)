You on the sideline talkin about the King
You just mad cause (I'm not you)

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Who hotter than C (C)? Who not in the streets? (streets)
I'm the landlord of it boy and you out of your lease (lease)

Got a lot of haters but I know they all gon' fit (fit)

If you ain't money, you not my lover like +Billie Jean+
I used to play the side, I used to play the wing
I'm so T.I., today I'm feelin like I'm a "King" (like a King)
I wake up Waco and not a rapper can tie 'em Tyler
No disrespect if you on your hustle, but I am higher (higher)
I'm the Messiah (Messiah), tired of bein humble
In love with green, so I'm a go and get me a jungle
She said 'you think you God, then call yourself Messiah'
But if I told you I was weak, then you'd call me a liar (liar)
Each verse is fire (fire) and you could call me sire
You find a rapper that can beat me, promise I'll retire
So cold and raw, that when I do my thang
You open the mixtape up and it's gon' smell like sushi man (sushi man)
Mixtape Messiah, get on the groupie train
It's takin off, if you ain't on it baby, you's a lame
