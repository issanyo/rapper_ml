Couple investments, a few of 'em made some major sense
Keep your two pennies, especially if you ain't made a cent
I learned the game and been getting publishing ever since
People that ain't made a dollar will say they ain't convinced
When you ride to 7-11 on some handle bars
You can't vision how catchy hooks could take a man to Mars
The problem is that y'all only just wanna hang with stars
Heard Lauryn sing and I wanted to take the world from Nas
I salute but I still demand applause
I've given infinite gifts, I still feel like Santa Clause
Males acting like girls I call it mano-pause
This the type of verse that I bet you that type of man would pause
I can't stop and give these haters what they ask for
99 thousand or more inside a cash drawer
I'm the type to keep a passport on the dashboard, looking for a south of France shore to make a dash for
Feeling like Damon Dash been moving that acappella
When times is bleak I hit the freeway like it's Roc-A-Fella
It's been a decade, get a clue that you could stop me never
You'd have a better chance of trying to stop a hot propeller
On a jet while smoking a cigarette, with gasoline on ya hands
Kerosene on ya breath, oh yes I do it the best, get verses then you are blessed I do it for what it's worth and I'll never do it for less, stress
Never that, I know the album is more than late
Looked quantity in the face and told it you're gonna wait
Send a salute to the people who push the culture straight, and those who culture hate I just hope you don't get to procreate
Met with some rappers that industry people over rate
Met with the Devil but said I wouldn't negotiate
Lyor made millions, Jay made millions
And if Cam made millions I'm feelin' like I can sure relate
Killa -- see Mr. Koopa got 'em quite jealous
People that hang with Mr. Koopa turn to sky dwellers
I'm from a city where the skinny turn to pie sellers
And if any say they making millis then they lie tellers
Preach
The struggle will never cease
Your struggle look like a puddle, my struggle look like a -- sheesh
I'm visualizing it clear like I'm Mr. Michael Artis
It's either Jackson or Jordan I feel like Michael on beats
Could'a been on a beach, instead I turn't to a beast
The clarity of my raps you'd think I created speech
Saw me dirty my cleats all over these Houston streets
The hundreds stay in my reach
The money stay on a leash
*Bark*, I know you hear them dogs barkin'
That hype beasting is in Houston what we call boppin'
I make I'm pay for all my words like it's a blog auction
And Go Daddy what she tells me when we blog shopping
I'm the type that'd make it and give it a fee
And you the type that make it they wouldn't take it for free
They look at you and they like "tell me what's in it for me" and wouldn't take ya disc if you put it under their Christmas tree
Me, let's talk about consistency
Consistently make 'em feel like these other rappers ain't sick as me
I'm currently in city they'll never get to see
The only suite that they'll ever see is a pack of swishas G
My OG be calling me to tell me that the streets miss me
He know I'm eating but the reason is I eat picky
Like PlayStation they pump fakin' and you'll see quickly
The game switched they'll always end up with a 360
Albums coming, I tell the doubters just wait till then
Shot videos and you know that I'd never waste a lens
They sleeping on me could hope that they never wake again
But they gotta be sleep when you're planning a rude awakening

[Hook]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

Hey yo Texas you know the puzzles what I had to solve
Ya prodigy be bringing havoc like I had a mob
Had three enemies, so them odds what I had to dodge
And now I'm riding in cars that look like avatars
They ain't never had the soft never had the hard, they try to make it sound deep to pretend they have a cause
Pushing them yellow bricks, no, that's where you have to pause
Most of 'em cowardly and lying like the man on Oz
They lying to you, falsifying within their little bars
They'd probably try to tell you Tommy really had a job
Tell you how they had to starve; how they had rob
Like I went to Heaven and took a blessing from the hand of God
Nah
Sorry I don't don't believe it
Don't believe what ya reading
Who the ones that achieved it?
Not them, we did
Irrelevance is as relevant as the person that said it, and you ain't never did anything, don't you ever forget it
That dialogue you can dead it
You borrow your mothers car and put half a tank of unleaded
