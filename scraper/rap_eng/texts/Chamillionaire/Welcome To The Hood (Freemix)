(Talking)
Ugh, hold up (Koopa)
Let me steal a set of ad-libs right quick and say (ayyeee)
Yeah, I like that, I like that
Chamillionaire.com you already know what it is
It's the General


Attention it's the general and I mean this sincerely
Just listen clearly I know everyone who really hear me
Got off the label you can record deal me but can't kill me
Anybody get mad about this verse they probably guilty, really

I get it done my middle name should be demonstrate
Hustle outta Maybach is how I meditate
I'm the one who wrapped the city up in yellow tape
You buy commercials on radio to celebrate
The Nyquil wasn't something I could ever take
When you're this sick there's nothing you can medicate
I'm the one Texas rapper that'll get it straight
I say a nickname bet your label levitates (wait)

Super fast or super slow bang it then rewind this
New rapper get on and watch how everybody rhymes switch
Y'all fakin' cakin' you can miss me with the kindness
Y'all some puppets that I wasn't tryna ride the pine with
Nah I don't ride dick when I turn it up real quick you better duck your head
Really none of y'all is better when it's touching bread
I have a meal then make a mill before I touch my bed (ugh)
Can't get drop (wha?), don't get guap (wha?), don't get got (wha?)
Don't flip flop (oh), your chick hot, won't lip lock
I don't got time, no tick tock

Remember DJs who tried to charge us to play our songs (no)
We got Sirotto then X-ed 'em out and we made our own (oh)
Who think I'm lying, point out the person that say I'm wrong
I will abuse your lil children (Hold up) no Eddie Long
Can't see that you ain't got next, then get an eye check
I'ma keep seeing my checks I call them iChecks
Wait up I got my weight up and ain't touched the Pyrex
Wait up you got your weight up homie, nah uh not yet
T-Pain use autotune, what they do? Auto tune
Jay-Z performin' we just watch them copy all his moves
Monkey see monkey do (true)
They say take each his own
If this who we gon' let get on then all of y'all can keep the thrown
