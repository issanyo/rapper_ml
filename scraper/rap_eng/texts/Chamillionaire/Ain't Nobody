[Hook - Chamillionaire] - 2X
Ain't nobody cool as me
Ain't nobody cool as me
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody, ain't nobody cool as me

Hold up

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
First of all let's talk about these leeches that be on my sack
Thinkin that I'm gon' get sacked, I Reggie Bush your cornerback
The realest that's on a plaque, the realest to get on a track
Just point me to where you at and I'll visit it on a map
No I'm not gonna say your name, you too lame to be announced
Keep my name up out your mouth and my success gonna take it out
To me it's raining in a drought, you fakers that's fadin out
You mad cause I'm what it is and just what it ain't about
And I came with a gang of clout, showed up with a Rapid Ric
He came with a stack of chips you can't explain with a adjective (huh, huh)
Catch me chillin with Victoria models
I be on twenty hour flights, layin horizontal
And you will want to but you can't even fathom
You ain't headed to the Opera, you can't even Phantom
See I hear 'em talkin but I can't understand 'em
These rappers hate the King but can't say that he isn't jammin
You say you hate me and think you rap so greatly
You should step up to the plate, do your best to replace me
That's what I thought, you can't do it, cause you ain't me
You flowin in a analog and I'm flowin in HD
Don't get a fan and a male groupie to confuse faker
Confuse it with a male groupie, it's probably you hater
Forget a newspaper, I'm tryin to do new data
So stuck to the viral money, it's feelin like glue paper
F it, I'm 'bout to get rid of my whole fleet
Just gon' keep any car that came before '03
Whole league, guacamole, I am on key
They said you have to be the best, so I'll just own me, yeah

[Hook]
