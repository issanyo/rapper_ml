[Talking]
Yeah, Uh, The King
You already know what this is...

[Verse 1]
I am the best rapper alive
If I ain't him the best rapper done lied
They say get money, and put that to the side
But if I do that, they gone think it's a tie
Who's sicker than I?
Look me in the eye
Ya'll fake rappers must be ready to die
Yeah, Yeah, I'll fix that. Click, Clack, Get back
Getting paid is a better feelin'
I don't wanna take the shot of penicillin
I ain't chillin, business dealin'
Look down on you. My floor is your ceiling
Solo, Unity. At your girlfriend crib tryin move the D
And the car got a super V
If a leaf fall on it, I'll shoot the tree (Yeah)
First name Hakeem, middle name money
Signature look clean
Mixtape scene, yall know I'm king
I'll put you on the screen like Sway and Shaheem
Rabbit, Rabbit, Gotta get cabbage
Mixtape savage, I rip through tablets
Crib so lavish, don't know magic
Shades just open like Go, Go Gadget
Like your readin my mind
Ya'll ain't keepin up with me and my rhyme
Make you exit like your readin a sign
I'm the hardest rapper LA Reid didn't sign
Got the balls to prove it
Venom album comin, get your exclusive
Don't try to act like your excluded
Cause your neck fit right on my nooses (Ha Ha)

Let me light it up, Let me light it up
I'm the best rapper, I swear
Let me make this clear...

He can rap and out sing ya (Uh)
I'm the one that out think ya
Damn, He just dropped a new single
I'll have the industry shook with one finger
50 got rich and he didn't even die
Jay getting rich, he ain't needin to reply
R. Kelly on the ground, he believin he can fly
I'm runnin through the drought like it isn't even dry
Amigo, me gotta get the peso
I get mo' like Shawty Lo, they know
I don't waive at a hater, call Magno
Money go "Ha Ha", Play-Doh (play dough)
Yeah, got mixtape bars
I'm the ruler of the mixtape art
Put 'em on sale like it's K-Mart
All bow down to the Mixtape God
