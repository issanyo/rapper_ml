I told em that
I'm a Rep Texas, yeah (my state) [x8]

Texas always on
Get it right
If you lookin for that good
Then get some Texas in your life
Then go check that naked lady
And them swangs unda the stud
Candy paint so wet I hope that you know how to surf
Man, RIP to Pimp C
Boys gettin full of that Texas tea
We ain't never eva tried to be like ya'll
So, ya'll know you really need to get like me
Sittin sideways in the HOV
Hit yo city and it's M-I-D
I-C-K to the C-H-I
See she the one that except my G
Psych
I don't ever pay that chick
I just do my thing real quick
Came to spit
Waitin for the major tip
Had to come and change my whip
Bang my disc
Then I'm gonna claim your chick
I just gotta lay my stick
I'm a be pokin with my balls
Like a pool hall til I make that split
Drip, drip
Come to Texas
Tell me that you see a joker, where?
I see Houston hustlers that be smokin on that joker hair
They respect them other regions like they get free dough from there
We ain't never been with that Hollywood
Listen, Texas ain't supposed to care
Ridin with Gorilla and you knowin he a killa
Need that fire, baby I'm a be a dealer
I ain't talkin bout work I'm talkin bout worth
Stayin on the grind cause I'm all about this skrilla
SK turn a playa hater into dinner
Shells harder then a home of a armadillo
She lookin like a winner
That you know I'm finna get up
Finna pop my trunk and I'm a go get her
I told em that
