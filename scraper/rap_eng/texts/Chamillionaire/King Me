I'm like the baddest rapper ever
Ever ever? Ever!
I always been it like I stood next to Uncle Fester
Swisher house professor taught y'all how to be successful
Used to Run a house like Rev and Diggy and Vanessa
Yes I got a stretcher that's for competition
Not in my position they ain't got a pot to piss in
You can call it dissin' they stay broke like it's tradition
Fly over the hood (man you must think you) Blake Griffin
Finger itching I got riching
My mother say she loving it
She took a million it took a year til I discovered it
I took my money out and I almost shut down the government
I threw it in the tub and let my main chick rubber dubbing it
The passcode on my bank account is Catch Me If You Can
I know they gay just undercover like they with the clan
Don't throw a rock and later say that you my biggest fan
Remove the mic right now so it don't break and beat you with this stand
Your girl be calling me like everytime she grab a phone
I never hear 'em all her messages be rather long
These losers copying too much and you can't say i'm wrong
Wiz Khalifa hit the joint, now everybody cheech ching chong

A sign that's on my door that say no man but me allowed
Might see your woman drying off in here without a towel
Don't get confused just cause the twitter picture got a smile
... post where you at and i'll come show up now
After I beat you down, twitpic and retweet this clown
I bet in person all these talkers ain't gon' leak a sound
I travel everywhere how come your boys don't be around
Take trips where y'all be missing y'all must live in lost and found

Rap game's a female chat and all y'all do is disrespectful her
Can't really say you fresh cause all of y'all is whack except for
A few it's maybe two yeah most of y'all is pop as Ke$ha
I wanna grab a bottle and just turn your tap to ketchup
I teach 'em how to stunt, super Dave done taught a lecture
See me 2012 and said you fresh as when I met ya
I'm in my robe and slippers walking round like i'm Hugh Heffner
I'm dressed in red your girl is black, jump on her like a checker
King me
