[Intro]
Mmmhmmm, alright
Chamillitary mayne
Mmmhmmm, the money's calling me
Everybody knows how I feel about my bank
Some say I'm heartless, but y'all know I ain't
Don't have no problems, as long as you're keeping it G
The money's calling me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I could have went Hollywood, but I stayed trill and remained true
Still riding them big blades that I slide on when I skate through
Ever told me you hate haters, well guess what, that makes two
Cause nowadays "he got paid", is code word for "I hate you"
You girl want me to serve pipe, got pa'tners on their third strike
And they going for they fourth, it's like they know they wanna serve life
Got pa'tners that sell Herbalife and got pa'tners that herb for life
No longer beefing with Mike Jones, but I still murder mics

[Hook 1]
City where you from, you made it from the slum
Now they're acting like you owe 'em you've gotta give 'em some
Park your Caddy in the sun
They didn't know you did it, but they'll always be some people getting mad about your digits
They boys that never did it, disrespecting what you've done
Got some ladies catching feelings, tryn'a be your number one
Got the world on your back, I know the pressure weigh a ton
But we keep on grindin' on 'em, tell 'em money here I come

[Hook 2]
I be like, let's go get it
Let's go get it
Pull the dropa out then I start it up, no acting timid
I'm like, let's go get it
Let's go get it
First I drop the top, then turn up the knock so they can feel it
I'm like, let's go get it
Let's go get it
Looking at my watch, time is money, so I'm counting minutes
Got the world on your back, know the pressure weigh a ton
But we keep on running on 'em, tell 'em money here I come

[Verse 2]
Can't sidetrack these lying cats
Tryn'a make me take a straight loss
He say he got them birdies, told 'em I don't even play golf
Completely different sport, they got me balling, practise paid off
Step back and hit that switch, it's like, there's no blocking my J, dawg
Got diamonds in my ring chain, celly going "rang rang"
Look down inside my dough make sure I've got my Kirko Bang Bang
And I ain't talking 'bout car bass
See how fast your heart race
And I keep it ghetto boy, but please don't end up with a scar-face
I twist in that little key, and then start my car up
Before noon, I flip mo' than registers at Starbucks
Don't talk much, I talk math, don't subtract, let's add
Gold Roley and [?], your accessories, then I'll laugh
Go count ones, then check twice, just get it right, don't guess though
I hope the money ain't short dawg, cause I never settle for less ho
A big salute to my congregation, we get dollars no Creflo
Two money pockets with money in them is always part of my dress code

[Hook]

[Post-Hook]
I be like, let's go get it, alright
Let's go get it (go), let's go get it, alright
Let's go get it (go), let's go get it, alright
Looking at my watch, time is money, so I'm counting minutes
Got the world on your back, I know the pressure weigh a ton
But we keep on grindin' on 'em, tell 'em money here I come
They ain't hustling the same as me, alright
The money's calling me

[Bridge]
We ain't worried 'bout a thing, cause we, alright
Grinding so hard they can't believe
They ain't really who they claim to be, alright
All this money's never changing me
Loyalty is everything to me, alright
And that's why, I'm staying suckerfree

[Hook 1]
