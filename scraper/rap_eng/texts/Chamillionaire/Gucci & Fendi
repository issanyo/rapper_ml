(Chorus - Sample from "Hate Me Now" by Nas - 2X)
Gucci this, Fendi that
Gucci this, Fendi that
Gucci this, Fendi that
Fendi this, Fendi that

(Break - Sample from "Hate Me Now" by Nas - 2X)
(Fuck) this, (fuck) that
(Fuck) this, (fuck) that
(Fuck) this, (fuck) that
What you expect ho?

(Chamillionaire - talking over Chorus and Break)
Uh
Yeah
Mixtape Messiah Part 7
You already know, Chamillionaire, yeah
Excuse me for the repetitiveness in the hook but ah
Had to get your attention somehow, haha
Hold up, hold up, hold up
Yeeeah (woo)

(Chorus - 2X)
(Break - 2X)

(Verse 1 - Chamillionaire)
Auto-Tune could die but how do we erase the copycats? (how?)
Whatever replacin that, I bet they all gonna copy that
I could spit it sick, so tell me why would I be mad?
I be killin everything, my sponsor is the body bag
Messiah 7, this the final chapter
If you want anymore (no), you can rewind it after (yeah)
Industry nuthuggers actin like he ain't a factor
Well Bruce Leroy, we 'bout to show 'em "who's the master" (yeah)
They say you can't be gangsta if you're not in black
Rappers say they gangsta like that mean that they can not be whack
So I look around, realize I only got my strap
And just for the hell of it, I'm yellin "where my posse at?"
Nah, I don't have no homies homie, that's because
You could be my dog 'til you touch my money with ya paws
Grindin is like sex to me, work is like the best massage
Call my wallet Nikki, every day I'm tryin to get mÂ©naged
Hey don't be mad, lighten up, like C. DeBarge
Use my money for a step and I'm a have a seat on Mars
I drive by ya silly blogs
Mirrors on my cars, so all my haters can see they flaws
The past they want me to be a retro
But I'm so George Jetson, that the future what you get bro
Materialisticness is what they all respect though
So Esco can let the hook go (what you expect ho?)

(Chorus - 2X)
(Break - 2X)

(Verse 2 - Chamillionaire)
Yeah, yeah
Man I'm livin large (large), welcome to my fortress
Crib pale white, I call it the Scott Storch-ress
Maid talkin trash to me Like Weezy and George's
Ain't really that good at cleaning but she do it lookin gorgeous (woo!)
Ya got me lacin up my Forces
So van Gogh, it's time to paint a better portrait
Of course it's, time for my course to change courses
No Tony Danza, I got to show 'em "Who The Boss" is
Ya girl droolin on her Hewlett-Packard
Can't get me out her system, got me feelin like I'm a hacker
Rapper but my competition is just Casper
Ain't gotta flash the funds to turn ya freak into a flasher
Brain incredible ain't talkin where her weave is
Which one of y'all can get the "Royal penis the cleanest"?
If you don't get it, I'm tellin ya what I mean is
That you're smart and I'm tryin to be ingenious (haha)
How could I not enjoy my life?
Ain't a private plane on the planet, I ain't saw more than twice
The reason why they hit the mall or order ice
But it's more to life (life) and I know I'm more than right
Ya taught that money talks, they tell ya that ya one dimension
-al but all I know is that we need an intervention
So Gucci this and Fendi that is what I gotta mention
So now that I got your attention (what you expect ho?), haha

(Chorus - 2X)
(Break - 2X)

(Chamillionaire - talking over Chorus)
I talk that money talk
Yeah, yeah, so you know who the boss

(Outro - Chamillionaire - talking)
Mixtape Messiah Part 7, the final chapter
I once had an awkward moment just to see what it felt like, haha
