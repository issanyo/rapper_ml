[Intro: Lloyd & Chamillionaire]
It's time to make a movie, It's time to make a movie
It's time...(Oh Yeah)
Chamillitary mayne, and Young Lloyd, Twista. Let's get it

[Hook 1: Lloyd & Chamillionaire]
Girl you hypnotize me, love the way you move it
Sit back like a player while you doin' what you doin'
Whisper in my ear tellin' me how she gon' do me
Oh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie
Time to make a, ah ah, time to make a movie
Time to make a, oh yeah, it's time to make a movie
Time to make a, ah ah, time to make a movie
Oh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Let's get it
You know what it is homegirl let's get it
Your little boyfriend ain't ever know that we did it
Gotta homegirl let me know if she with it
Two girls, one bed let me know and we'll split it. Quit it
Tell me how he gonna know, way too much bread no Keebler though
When I see money I speed to the door
If it ain't no doe I speed to the doe
Where she finna go, stick to the script get used to my plot
Making it wet no use of a prop
I'll make you regret not using a mop
Booze to your stock, you looking hot
So I bet that we gonna Tom Cruise to the top
I could turn the Ros√© down to the south
And I love how your mouth never losing the drop
Ey, you could have it girl
Not an amateur, I could manage ya
Candy car looking bluer than an Avatar
I'll help you get your groove back like Angela
I could handle her, show her I'm the best
An Academy Award yeah the Oscars next
And Trey Songz telling you that he invented sex
I guess you can say that I invented checks

[Hook 1: Lloyd & Chamillionaire]

[Verse 2: Twista]
What's up little mama, come and meet me your manager
Be your photographer, you be the one ima take a picture of (click)
You could be on my cinema, then ima get you whatever you want
Then ima do anything to get your love
Hit it from the back and hit it from the front
And ima look in the camera so I could let em know it's up in it (Twista)
When I'm filmin', I'll be ready, next triple
Cause I suck on your nipples and every movie you gon be up in it
Pull me out and people be classy and but when we get some privacy baby you can be my porn star
Keep the lights on
Cause I wanna see it, it's better for shootin'
And how you be lookin' I see you goin' far
See me blow you a kiss, you blow it right back
Openin' up your legs now you on the right track
Let me aim the camera down while you wipe that
Lookin' freaky up at the legs, do you like that?
That, that. I'll be workin' your body like I be working the pictures in the portfolio
I don't know if it was a face, it was a hair, it was an ass, that made me want to put you up in the video
It's the Twista with the Chamillionaire
Murder in the booth when I smoke a philly in there
I'll be the director come and gimme a chair
Star quality I'll see if it's really in there

[Hook 2: Lloyd & Chamillionaire]
Girl you hypnotize me, love the way you move it
Sit back like a player while you doin' what you doin'
Whisper in my ear tellin' me how she gon' do me
Oh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie
Ain't no need to be nervous, we can get some room service
I can give it how you want it girl if that's okay
Time to make a movie, movie, time to make a movie
Gotta tell me how you want it, you know ima be up on it from the night till the mornin' girl if that's okay
Time to make a movie, movie, time to make a movie
One, two, three, go. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, she likes me, oh. Let's get it
One, two, three, go. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, she likes me, oh
Let's make a movie
