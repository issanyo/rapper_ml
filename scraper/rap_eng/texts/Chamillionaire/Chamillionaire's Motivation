(*talking*)
Better get it resolved nigga, (get it resolved baby)
Better get it resolved nigga, (you got a problem)
It's your's truly, Chamillionaire the Mixtape Messiah
In here with DJ Smallz, Man On Fire I got th streets mayn
If I don't got it, then I'm gonna get it (I know you hating)
But it's cool I got some'ing for that, October 4th
"The Sound of Revenge", that's what it is pimp

[Intro]
I know you hate, cause I'm the man on fire
Other known, as the Mixtape Messiah
I know you hate, the colored diamonds I'm rocking
Top drop, chameleon paint flip-flopping
I know you hate, the way I got my do'
Hate when they tell you, I'm about to blow
Now they asking, why we hate eachother
Niggas hate niggas fake, so I keep it gutter

[Chamillionaire]
Rapper I think not, like Thugger man I ain't heard of that
The album dropping, sign on the wall gon say refer to placks
Don't talk to me, nigga move around as I turn the Lac
Hop out and I watch how that console, on that wood sturn detach
The public love it, cause base say you don't deserve the tracks
Accapella never ever ever, done said a word of fact
Go find the damage, and it punched and inserted that
Send 'em back to pro-tool school, you go and learn to rap
Present is what it is, and that means that it ain't no turning back
You can bleach your shirt, if you white then it ain't no turning black
But listen close, cause it prolly didn't occur to that cat
That he can see me and easily beef, I serve him that
I don't spit that murder rap, rapping wise I murder cats
Lyrical plack, better wipe it off like you had some dirt attached
Rapping guys, need to realize when they turn the rap
Book pagr look mayn, get it popping it's like the Cornel's back
It's Koopa, still take home the trophy with no assist
Ain't none of 'em on my level, and now you just noticed this
Now you just know they pissed, when you say who the thoedest is
Getting mad and they throw a fit, get mad and I throw my fist
I don't lose sleep for haters, I won't be up later
When Ron Cizzle getting paper, I won't be no hater
Movie Festival, I'm watching "How To Be A Player"
But then it changed to what channel, "How To Be A Traitor"
BKT to Ron C, Lil' Flip then me
These traitors doing so much traiting, looks like they god damn flea
Mark it but park it, while I tell you why these boys hate me
Cause I'm exactly what these other suckers, just can't be
And that's the truth baby, don't get me started again
Cause this time the nail in the coffin, and I'm bombing on them
Say my name on wax for me, wish your boy with a Tim'
DJ's know that I'm bringing drama, like that Squad full of Pimps
