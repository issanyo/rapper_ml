[Hook]
Gas prices raises, the money keeps burning
Dropout rate rising, so what are they learning?
Sending the troops in the war so I turn it
To today's evening news
And the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps on turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
This is your evening news

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the evening news
I thank you all for tuning in
Yes, I'm your host and your journalist
It's Chamillionaire, so let the news begin
Our helicopter's out in the streets
Look at the screen and let's zoom it in
Cause Cassius is live at the scene
"Hey, Cassius, how are you, my friend?"
Got no time for no interviews
(Got no time for no interviews)
No time to trip, don't be confused
Cause this type of news: opinions and views
Got no time for no interviews
(Got no time for no interviews)
You know I keep my ear to the streets
So it's up to me to bring you the truth
I saw a movie where George Bush
Had a bearded man on his squad
So much power from oil money
That poor folks can't sit by him
No problem, Osama, Bin Laden, been hidin'
So long that them pictures all starting
To look like him on them milk cartons
Don Imus made comments
That made everybody forget about him
That's him, Anna Nicole
Got pregnant and had kids by him
Rest in peace to Virgina Tech
Too many innocent kids dyin'
"Well, let's just blame hip-hop
And act like that's the big problem"
Now I would give you news about Katrina
But you know I can't talk about Katrina
'Cause every time I talk about Katrina
They look at me like it's a misdemeanor
Anyways, there's way more important stuff that we can discuss
George Bush is playing golf, everybody hush, he's about to putt

[Verse 2]
I know you take offense to certain words
I've heard worse, but I wouldn't blame ya'
They say he's a entertainer
Don't worry about it, never mind Kramer
The Crocodile Hunter got stung
And the lion turned on the lion tamer
We keep sending troops to Iraq
I figure that we must like danger
Little kids don't learn in school
They go to school to go spray a gun
If you a parent, then be a parent
Get off the couch and go raise your son
Kobe just broke another record
Today's game he hit 81
Now they saying he's number 1
Yesterday they all hated him
OJ was named innocent
He got no sentence, he's still alive
It's very ironic that the lawyer that defended him had to die
Well, now my cue card says the price of gas isn't really high
But I'm not going to read that, cause we all know that that's a lie

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We still haven't found Pac's killer
Still haven't found Biggie's either
Thirty minutes into the case
They got tired and took a breather
Snoop Dogg just got arrested
Every day he get a new subpoena
Innocent when murder was the case
So the prosecution got a middle finger
Hip-hop is sweeping the nation
But the content seem so degrading
Most rappers got new albums
That white kids are anticipating
If you don't like it on the radio
Or the television then switch the station
Flavor Flav get a lot of ratings
Bill O'Reilly, somewhere, is hating
Kanye just said WHAT?
The president ain't got time for that
The White House is going to stay white
Even though we know that Obama's black
9/11 was a calculation
And some would say it was a timed attack
He gave a speech on CNN
"They bombed us, now we're bombing back"
Where the heck is Osama at?
And I would love to talk about Katrina
But every time I talk about Katrina
They look at me like it's a misdemeanor
Anyways thereâ€™s way more important stuff that we can discuss
*NSYNC, Making the Band, and Milli Vanilli have broken up
