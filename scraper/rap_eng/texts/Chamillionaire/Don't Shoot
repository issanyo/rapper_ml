[Verse 1]
I know the governments working
You ain't never seen them in person
Do you really think that you're the only person that sees the sites that you're searching?
See I'm flicking channels just surfing
Because I heard we about to start merking
I change the channel to the news channel
What the hell they talking 'bout? Twerking?
I'm American, my folks African
My mom say she about to back again
Cause ya'll chasing Ye's and Kardashian's
And not even seeing what's happening
Police is known for drug trafficking
Will put a package on ya in traffic and
These little kids that known to keep straps with them
And these grown adults are still acting ten
I'm like hype beasts, we know about ya
Miley twerked on one show and got ya
Even type like you 'bout that life
And you'd bring a knife to a show with Flocka
Your PDA is just so improper
Panties show in your open locker
I'm so Ibaka, I'm gonna block ya
So bad you'll have to ask for a doctor, that's truth
Young and in the streets trying to move a brick
He don't really care if your crew can spit
He got the hammer on his hip feeling too legit (switch)
Trap is on fire they like it they copy
And they all they want is Versace Versace
He's after that cream and he's only 16
But his chopper is cocky and stocky as rocky
Don't shoot

[Hook]
No need to tell me who's popping
Can't you see the drones in the sky?
I'm like "Do you think that they watching?"
I really try to keep to myself but keep getting caught up in all the hype
I hope the verses y'all made for Kendrick bring our economy back to life
If they do
Don't shoot, really that'd be great
Don't shoot, really that'd be great
Don't shoot
Don't shoot
Don't shoot
Cause missiles only say kaboom

[Verse 2]
He graduated up to moving packs
His homie showed him how to package right
Ironically he's never grabbed a mic
But they be calling everybody rappers right
His family rich but he be acting like he wanna leave it all to live the ratchet life
You acting like you wanna sacrifice your whole life 'cause you believe the rapper hype
Impressing who? Does this even equal Success to you? If it do
Are you a vegetable? Are you an idiot or intellectual?
I seen many people and many G's that's did plenty crimes that they'd would never do
Your favorite rapper ain't streets he at a nice hotel or at a festival
Stop watching WCW, cause real life is something like MMA
See they complain about NSA but they snitching on themselves every day
You got YouFools you got Snitchagrams, you got Crimelines, what else, FaceCrooks
Posting pictures from the trap house to show they hustle harder than an Ace Hook
And that's truth

[Hook 2]
Come on, can't you see the Feds watching?
Do you think that your call logs are the only thing that they're clocking?
I really try to keep to myself but keep getting caught up in all the hype
I hope the Feds don't kick down your door with them weapons out and y'all sounding like: "Don't shoot"
Don't shoot, don't get blown away
Don't shoot, don't get blown away
Don't shoot
Don't shoot
Don't shoot
'Cause missiles only say kaboom

[Bridge]
Hope your favorite trapper drops a CD that'll save ya
Hope your favorite rapper isn't still on tour in Asia
Hope your favorite actor turns into the Terminator
Better hide right now when they shoot

[Verse 3]
I could've been the one
I could've been Trayvon
I stay hungry plus I got an appetite
He had some Skittles and a Snapple right?
Well really that's what's made me wanna snap tonight
An angry rapper I'm acting like
You know I'm really ain't the acting type
I'm really like, if that was one of mine
He'd be apologizing in the afterlife
It isn't black or white
It's really wack or right
I know the raps I write be sounding so hypocritical
But the candy's really soaked in a mineral
So you can tell a critic he can choke on a genital
I wasn't taking it from no individual
Keep the convo with 5-0 to minimal
They try to tell him that they know he a criminal
But I'm the one to tell him let them know you a general
Hard to say they can't stay armed
When George Zimmermans that got their guns
Kinda hard to tell them "Just pray son"
When he feeling like he getting preyed on
So I think we need a liaison
And y'all saw what happened to Trayvon
And if you bomb and then they bomb
Who the hell are we to say they wrong
Don't shoot

[Hook]
Mr. President were all watching
Can't you you see they got army guns and these windy city kids dropping?
I really try keep to myself but keep getting caught up in all the hype
You really think a new law for guns gonna erase the ones that they got the night that they shoot

Don't shoot
Don't shoot
Don't shoot
Don't shoot
Don't shoot
'Cause missiles only say kaboom
Kaboom

[Verse 4]
Nothing really giving me a new feeling
Nothing really giving me a new feeling
Wikileaks in the roof
We don't need a damn fix, we just need new ceiling
Ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em
Yeah, I said it but I didn't mean it
I ain't think the government would try to turn us to the new villains
The other day, I heard my mother say
She had a dream that the president would take us to a world war
I heard somebody else say when it does happen then hopefully they'll put it up on World Star
Murder, Zimmerman hopped in his car a served off
Murder, crazy how the world will hit you with a curve ball
