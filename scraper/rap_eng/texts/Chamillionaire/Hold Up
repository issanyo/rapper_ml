[Verse 1]
Self-employed so I’m paying me
Stayin’ trill ’cause it pay to be
Won’t lie I parked handicapped
And then get a ticket and pay the fee
Ridin’ 84 or the 83
Ain’t ridin’ them then they ain’t wit me
How y’all pay to get in the club
And then hate on the person y’all pay to see
Now we got my block live again
Look at these whips we’re riding in
Making balling look easy baby
We don’t practice like Iverson
Sliding in on them super pokes
When I’m getting close
Just guard your face
All the sinners start calling God
All the rappers start calling Mase
Drop sounding like an earthquake
Trunk bound to make the earth shake
Every day is a movie for me
Like the destination on the first date
Telling me it’s her birthday
New shoes and her purse suede
You should go and preach to the choir
I ain’t the one that you can persuade
She ain’t worthy of a hotel
I wouldn’t even get a motel
Mess around and take your girl from you
Then sell her to ya for the whole sell (Oh well)
Have her back
Won't love her but I love the stacks
So I’m pulling up in that you know what
And they looking at me like "what is that?"

[Hook]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up
That’s what they call it
Soon they see me roll up, roll up
They don’t know what to call that
So they call it, call it, call it
Hold up, hold up, hold up
That’s what they call it
Hold up, hold up, hold up
That’s what they call it
Soon they see roll up, roll up
They don’t know what to call that
So they call it, call it, call it
Hold up

[Verse 2]
Told Brad to send me a track
He send me a track that sound like the trap
I don’t know normally do this
But hey when I do it sound like a "b-b-r-rat"
Competition left laying flat
I’m just hoping that you try
I’m just hoping you try to try me
Get drag around by your suit tie
You can catch me in a foreign city
Where they don’t even know I rap
First album when platinum
So there ain’t many places on my map
Going golf in Iraq
Going shopping in Dubai
She’ll be asking her man for gifts
And give me the gifts the her dude buy
Bought a wallet with a mouse trap
No rat can get my cheese
Hoodrats get no scraps
Get throwed back like huaraches
Wanna book me for 5 Gs
Read the sign that say stop please
Can’t knock me my trunk knockin
Might make your woman look, knock knee
Call me but I’m unreachable
Too trill to be speaking to
Got lost in my own garage
And they couldn’t find me for a week or two
My trunk’ll open like peek-a-boo
Neon lights’ll be seeping through
Candy blue, all my speakers blue
But I turned ‘em up and my speakers blew

[Hook]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up
That’s what they call it
Soon they see me roll up, roll up
They don’t know what to call that
So they call it, call it, call it
Hold up, hold up, hold up
That’s what they call it
Hold up, hold up, hold up
That’s what they call it
Soon they see roll up, roll up
They don’t know what to call that
So they call it, call it, call it
Hold up

[Verse 3]
Hold up man, just hold up man
Rep the state then pour up then
Chew up cheese and throw up grands
Then get some bread y'all know I’m jam
It’s lunch time, she got one friend
But just one fine
One four, one dime
You already know which one mine
Tripping like Juicy J
Cee Lo done got me in the booth today
If it come 'tween hoes and dough
I drop off the chick and then scoop the pay
Might as well, I might as well
Passing up dough is a major fail
Take a trip to South Africa
But can’t leave the paper like Dave Chappelle
Realest rapper you’ll ever meet
She want an autograph on her fake breast
Too young or just too dumb
Girl slow it down and take a brake test
Jackers out when my Lac is out
Don’t worry 'bout it, I ain’t stressed
Hot chocolate on my hollow tips
They might mess around and get a taste test

[Hook]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up
That’s what they call it
Soon they see me roll up, roll up
They don’t know what to call that
So they call it, call it, call it
Hold up, hold up, hold up
That’s what they call it
Hold up, hold up, hold up
That’s what they call it
Soon they see roll up, roll up
They don’t know what to call that
So they call it, call it, call it
Hold up
