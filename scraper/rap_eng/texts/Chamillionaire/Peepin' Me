[Hook]
I can tell by the way that you peepin' me
That you havin' some thoughts about freakin' me
But if you walk up and just speak to me
And tell me what you like we'll hook up tonight yeah

[Chamillionaire]
I can tell by the way that you peepin' me
That you haven't been satisfied recently
Haven't been with a P.I.M.P. like me
But if that's what you like your in luck tonight yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah black Dickies, black vehicle, pull up on black dubs
During that party I'm in that hive pullin' freaks for after
Nothing gets a broad looser than a stack of cash does
So them rims bigger than dubs let me see how good they math was
Count them inches, they peepin' as the truck get suspended
Feelin' splendid, got a stack and I'ma use it 'till its ended
I'ma spend it on the bottle after I get bartended
I'ma walk up and choose you and hope your friends don't get offended
I'ma playa, I don't dance what I gotta dance for
I just peep hoes from the bar and pull 'em off the dance floor
With a chick in the club posted up in the back of
That club got a girl but I'm actin' like a bachelor
Snatch her
Can't tell me that she ain't ready for the part
Lights, camera, action act like she ain't never seen a star
Seen the corner of your eyes looking this way at the bar
Let you slip out of them cuffs cuz your nigga ain't on his job

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
In the club you backin it up I'm lovin what I see and a
Doin it like its yo b-day

Throwin my wallet give a 100 dollars to the DJ
So he can play that song again I see the instant replay
I can tell that you lovein all the attention
Of the boys thats trying to snatch ya
Hopin that they just keep attendin
Cuz you know who you really concentratin on gettin
Yeah you know Koopa is that playa that keep it pimpin

And I noticed that your still peepin me peepin me

I turned to look ova at you frequently
And I noticed that your still peepin me peepin me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I can see the look in your eyes baby you wantin it bad huh
Wonderin if its gonna be right and wonderin what I have for

Milk does the body good but not as good as that huh
Now that buzz got you feelin ready and ready on that move
But before you can step to me a nigga already approachin you
Walkin like a motion screwed
While I'm picturein you in the nude
I'ma tell her the motions cleava its whateva you want to do
I can tell by the way you been peepin
Tryin to visit me on the weekend
Trying to have that bed sqeekin sqeekin
Yeah even a couple of friends drinkin
Thinkin bout gettin even
Wit a man who have been cheatin
So I sweep 'em right off their pretty toes
Like a set of voes
Never seen a old school vehicle wit wetta doors
She asked is she could leave wit me and I should let her go
Man I'm just too much of a playa to refuse and tell her no
