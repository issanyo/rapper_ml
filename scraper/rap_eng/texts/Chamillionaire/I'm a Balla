[Hook - Chamillionaire]
I'm A Balla, I walk the walk bruh
I'm not a talker
I keep it pimpin' so these women 'll pay me
If you a balla, and bout ya dollars
Then throw ya hands up if you gettin' it daily
Don't even talk uh, bout what it cost ya
If you ain't really out there gettin' it baby
If you a balla, and a shot calla
Then throw ya hands up if you gettin' it daily

[Verse - Chamillionaire]
Koopa, I got comma's and zero's
And a lot of robert deniro
I know hoes that love other hoes
That'll get down in a trio
But it ain't nothin' to me though
I'mma grinder, yall know my steelo
Got no record or no P.O
But I dodge police like I'm Neo, nigga we know
Far East and Chamillionaire
Gon' bring 4 stacks then spend a pair
Throw 2 other stacks in the air
We stepped in here like G-G-G'yeah
You a balla, let me see it

Bout them dollars, let me see it
Pop ya collar, G-G-G'yeah

Chokin' on that charlie dutchey
And I keep one on my side

Pausin', never keep it movin' like my rims
They say I'm clever, but it's the cheddar I spend that's makes me win
If you a baller then dribble til' ya hands get tired
Cuz that's the way my wrist feels when I'm tryna raise it higher
You a balla, let me see it
Shot caller, let me see it
Bout them dollars, let me see it
Pop ya collar, let me see it

[Verse - Lumba]
Like where do I start, or where do I begin
When it comes to ballin' and flossin', I shine like them rims
That's intend to spin, act like a crip, nah fuck it dog
Act like a chimp, like crooked monkeys throwin' up sets
You ain't no throw em' up click, you used to throwin' up bricks
We pro-ballers down south daddy, empty the clips
I got 5 in my eye, I need 10 on my wrist
So while I'm flippin' ya bitch, I put 10 to the lips
It's just that young boy Lumba
Who's known to bump a
Take over the industry, while these other rappers crumble
I'mma balla, you can see it
I'mma shot caller, you can see it
I'mma flosser, you can see it
Superstar, gonna be it
