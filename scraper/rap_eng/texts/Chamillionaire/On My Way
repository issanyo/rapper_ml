[Intro: Lee-Lonn]
On my way, my way
On my way, my way

[Hook: Lee-Lonn]
You just need motivation
So I'm thinking
You should let me give you more than conversation
Just a demonstration
How
Ima lay your body down
I'm on the way
I'm in my ride and I'm coasting
Headed to ya
I'm on my way, my way
In my ride and I'm coasting
Headed to ya
I'm on my way, my way
Take it easy

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
I'm on my way
Hey
When I'm pullin' up in my drop miss
You know it's normally topless
You know them suckaz ain't got this
Cuz their car garages are dropless
I hope ya door is unlocked if
You need I'll be ya new locksmith
I took so long cuz my driveway
Look like the parkin' lot at metropolis
I'm always careful which whip to choose
No evidence or forgetting shoes
If breaking broads was against the rules
I know everyday I'd be getting sued
Chopped and screwed to get you in the mood
Get out ya shoes, get in the nude
Ever since they told me money talks
I been chatting like I'm being interviewed
It must be something that's in Moscato
That make a model, say that she'll swallow
On the way and all I can say
Is I'm there before you done wit the bottle
Shift the gear, then I hit the throttle
I swerved so much that I missed a pothole
On the way, it's your lucky day
I'm 'boutta make you feel like you hit the lotto

[Hook: Lee-Lonn]
You just need motivation
So I'm thinking
You should let me give you more than conversation
Just a demonstration
How
Ima lay your body down
I'm on the way
I'm in my ride and I'm coasting
Headed to ya
I'm on my way, my way
In my ride and I'm coasting
Headed to ya
I'm on my way, my way
Take it easy

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
I turn the corner, I'm tippin down
You in the presence of greatness
Never been a Chef Boyardee
I can't let the women and cake mix
That's tasteless and I taste chips
Forgive the kid for my lateness
Before you even turn off the lights
I'll be there to give you a face lift
What I meant by that last line
Is Ima be in your face like botox
If you got socks, then loose those socks
And have nothing on but your throat box
Diamonds larger than road rocks
While I'm 'bout to prove how I show stop
Car looking like a cruise ship but I got no garage
I load docks (I load docks)
No road blocks (No road blocks)
I float daily (I float daily)
And you'll float too
When I get to you it'll get so wavy
I'm the only playa you know lately
That can coach a girl to get so crazy
Make you kiss a girl like you know Katy
I can motivate ya
Let's go baby!

[Hook: Lee-Lonn]
You just need motivation

Headed to ya
I'm on my way, my way
In my ride and I'm coasting
Headed to ya
I'm on my way, my way
Take it easy

[Bridge: Chamillionaire]
I'm about to exit the freeway
To brake you off if you'll let me
(I just know that) you'll let me
(I just know that) you'll let me
I'm pullin' up in your driveway
I just hope that you're ready
(I just hope that) you're ready
(I just hope that) you're ready

(Nothing but the finest candy coats is what ya tasting)
(Push it to the limit)
(Call it motor motivation)
(Hope ya buckled up)
(I hope ya seatbelt got ya braced in)
(Texas playa so well)
(Do it slow or switch the pace then)

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
I'll be the playa headed to your location
To be the person that you're putting your faith in
The pillow that you layin' on waitin'
Will be the pillow that you're puttin' your face in
I told her never get it mistaken
I know I'm better than the rest, I got great wind
Good things for those who stay patient
I bet I get a couple standing ovations
