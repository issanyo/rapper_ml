[Intro: R. Kelly & Chamillionaire]
And This for my niggas, bitches, playas, pimps
While they keep it in the street, we gon' keep it in the streets
And This for my niggas, bitches, playas, pimps
While they keep it in the street, we gon' keep it in the streets
(Kellz, Chi, do it like this, put up a C, y'all)

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Hey hey (hey hey), I'm Hollyhood (I'm Hollyhood)
I'm on Patr贸n in the club feelin' good (I'm feelin' good)
Hey hey (hey hey), I'm so high (so high)
And the DJ got the club so live (so live)
Hands Up (hands Up)
Now let 'em bounce (let 'em bounce)
2 step it, lil mama, work it out (we gon' work it out now)
Go down (go down) now get dirty (get dirty)
Go down (go down) now get dirty (get dirty)

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Roll up on them wheels again
Hop up out the whip again
Fuckin' wit' them chicks again
In the club, Kellz on the scene again
Order me some rounds again
Man, I'm 'bout to clown again
I'm about to see them strippers coming down them poles again
Niggas in the club gettin' out of control again
Man, they 'bout to come and shut this whole bitch down again
Take it to my crib, that's what's up
The afterparty, that's what's up
Straight to the morning, that's what's up
Now get the fuck out, that's what's up
Stuntin', I don't give a fuck
Take my chain, hold it up
Bounce it like a real playa
Pimp oil in my cup
Man, I'm in the club and I'm looking and for a main chick
Someone I can brain chick
Someone I can stand chick

[Chorus: R. Kelly & (Chamillionaire)]
Hey hey (hey hey), I'm Hollyhood (I'm Hollyhood)
I'm on Patr贸n in the club feelin' good (I'm feelin' good)
Hey hey (hey hey), I'm so high (so high)
And the DJ got the club so live (so live)
Hands Up (hands Up)
Now let 'em bounce (let 'em bounce)
2 step it, lil mama, work it out (we gon' work it out now)
Go down (go down) now get dirty (get dirty)
Go down (go down) now get dirty (get dirty)

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Yeah, ladies tell me I'm too cute
And that translates that I'm too rich
They wanna spend the night at the crib
So they hit the club with two fits
We always be in VIP
And each playa got two chicks
They look at us like we live here
They look at y'all like "who's this"
We ain't trippin' about the media
Send 'em one of our platinum plaques
Matter fact
You can send picture of our middle fingers attached to that
All eyes (all eyes) on me (on me) (all eyes on me)
'Cause I'm the player all the haters wanna be (wanna be)
Chamillitary, yeah

[Chorus: R. Kelly & (Chamillionaire)]
Hey hey (hey hey), I'm Hollyhood (I'm Hollyhood)
I'm on Patr贸n in the club feelin' good (I'm feelin' good)
Hey hey (hey hey), I'm so high (so high)
And the DJ got the club so live (so live)
Hands Up (hands Up)
Now let 'em bounce (let 'em bounce)
2 step it, lil mama, work it out (we gon' work it out now)
Go down (go down) now get dirty (get dirty)
Go down (go down) now get dirty (get dirty)

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Purple phantom, dip low
Blowin' out that purple smoke
Open up that closet door
Fresh shoes, fresh clothes
Private jets, taking trips
Ballin', mayne, spendin' chips
Give that girl a gold medal
The way she out there turning flips
Bend it over, that's what's up
Now shake it nasty, that's what's up
Girl, here's my number, that's what's up
Get at me, that's what's up
Man, you know we pimpin'
Man, you know we sippin'
Man, you know we got them chicks in the pool skinny dippin'
Kellz

[Chorus: R. Kelly & (Chamillionaire)]
Hey hey (hey hey), I'm Hollyhood (I'm Hollyhood)
I'm on Patr贸n in the club feelin' good (I'm feelin' good)
Hey hey (hey hey), I'm so high (so high)
And the DJ got the club so live (so live)
Hands Up (hands Up)
Now let 'em bounce (let 'em bounce)
2 step it, lil mama, work it out (we gon' work it out now)
Go down (go down) now get dirty (get dirty)
Go down (go down) now get dirty (get dirty)
