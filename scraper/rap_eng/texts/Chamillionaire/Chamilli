[Intro:]
And now for a message from (Chamillitary Mayne)
Yours truly, haha
Why it sound like it sayin' my name? y-yeah
ChaMilli ChaMilli ChaMilli ChaMilli
I'm you'llin on 'em like Soulja Boy
Bombin' on 'em like Ice-T
So you better do the right thing
Like a throwback Spike Lee

[Verse:]
Chamillionaire, the mixtape god will answer your prayer
Now that the best verse on Milli is right here
If you ain't making a milli or more then what is you on the beat for?
Detour, he poor, but he say he a d boy
D boy? All the rappers act like they need war
But when it's war they equivalent to the Peace Corp
I murder mixtapes for years, they probably told you "no way"
Everybody know the truth bout what I did in the past like O.J
You in the way of the paper chase when I get on the tollway
You better be able to jump an Aston Martin like you're Kobe
If you can't handle the trill then you'd better not interview me
Everybody's a gangsta, you fakers could never fool me
I live in a suave house, I stay Tony Draped up in jewelery
I know that I rap a lot so they leave the crib with the tooley
I don't really give a care about how any of these haters view me
Probably think he gon' shoot me, stretch me out like a dooley
Vivid imagination, colorful as a Coogi
Must of been watching Scarface and got your life out the movie
OKAY! I'm hearing snoring, the industry's getting boring
All of the millions they been enjoying, from publishing and touring
Write a check it's private jet, you write a check and it go boing
And I swear this track says milli so much that it can get annoying
Somebody please send a message to Bangladesh, I ain't the best
Today is backwards day, and that will also mean I ain't the fresh-
Est rapper, make a bet and I will take the bet
Was looking for a place to get, pulled out a pen and I placed a cheque
Somebody send a message to Dr. Dre and Eminem
They taking so long to drop that we jam Soulja Boy instead of them
And YOUUUU'll, hear what I'm saying if you're intelligent
It looks to me your girl has been everywhere that my umbrella's been
It's raining Benjamin's, but that ain't 3k is it?
It ain't a Benjamin or an Andre if you ain't get it
You gotta rewind it, don't try to tell me that I can't spit it
Sick cause if it isn't then we just isn't in the same clinic
And to tell the truth, I don't know if the DJs dead homie
But the way it's going, Autotune will be at the ceremony
When it's time to hear the EULOGY, ain't no foolin me
I'll make Kanye West tell you that Lupe isn't cool as me
Don't put my name with beef, you nerds are such a tease
It's like you freakin Alicia the way you stroke your keys
And socially, no one as dope as me and they ain't supposed to be
I'm over free, now the F'in fee is what you owe to me
You know you're no Dupri, but you're a Germ-mayne
I got the sanitizer that'll extinguish your fame
I'm the villain and you Gilligan, lost if you get in the middle when
I'm swimming, and I'm killing them, with all my killer pen-a-men-
Ship, you ain't tall enough, raise your hand if you have to talk
Slim's belt to Ross' belly man, you half a boss
You'd think it was made of pig skin the way I pass it off
You know the Cannon gon' be with me like I'm Asher Roth
And I'm so dysfunctional that the flow is that Britney
And the mixtapes is crackin', every verse is that Whitney
Before you gettin' online, before you try to Datpiff me
[Inhale] Big breath like you inherited Shaq's kidney
A Milli
