[Intro]
Chamillitary man!
Get off your couch and go get it!

[Chorus (K-Ci)]
I'm up early in the mornin, thinkin bout gettin this money
All I know's I've gotta get that paper
The hustlers told me that I gotta go and get it
Now I'm gettin it the best way I know how
I won't let you down, won't let you down, I won't let you down, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, won't let you down, I won't let you down, I won't let you down
I won't let you down

[Verse 1]
I'm Up earlier than a mutha, chasin mine 'cause I'm a hustler
And tomorrow everything is gon' remind, gon' rewind
Only 7 days a week and 24 hours a day
That ain't enough for me so I ain't wastin time, wastin time
Cause only dreams come to sleepers and my life ain't gettin cheaper
So you know them dollar signs stay on my mind, on my mind
When they ask me where I'm goin, I say you already know it
Bout to hit the streets and go and get whats mine
I won't let you down

Dreams of havin finer things, riding blades, dreamin should
Make you wanna wake up and get it In real life and see the wood
In your grill, if you're slip and dont grab what you're seein, good
Only place that you gon be or ever see gon be the hood

[Chorus (K-Ci)]
I'm up early in the mornin, thinkin bout gettin this money
All I know's I've gotta get that paper
The hustlers told me that I gotta go and get it
Now I'm gettin it the best way I know how
I won't let you down, won't let you down, I won't let you down, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, won't let you down, I won't let you down, I won't let you down
I won't let you down

[Verse 2]
Boy that word ain't no excuse, you know what it mean to me
Means your passin over opportunities repeatedly
Write it on a piece of paper, only thing I see is P
Paper paper paper, chaser a better thing for me to be
No my services ain't for free, make that money multiply
Up early in the mornin I'll be gone A chase with me it ain't gonna be no tie
Tryna explain and give em game, I dunno why I even try
You'd do the same if you was I but you are you so you gon lie
Make them think that you got cash, tell them ladies you got slabs
Only thing you get is laughs, you can't even bring down half of the bill thats on that tab
ONly thing wrong with being broke is staying broke and makin excuses bout it like it ain't no thang

[Chorus (K-Ci)]
I'm up early in the mornin, thinkin bout gettin this money
All I know's I've gotta get that paper
The hustlers told me that I gotta go and get it
Now I'm gettin it the best way I know how
I won't let you down, won't let you down, I won't let you down, I won't let you down
I won't let you down

[Verse 3]
In the hood, having nothin, wishin I was havin somethin
I remember it like it was yesterday, yesterday
They was talkin down on me, and I lost a couple homies
I was gettin mine while they used to play, used to play
They say I need to slow down but I ain't slowin down for nothin
I dont wanna let that paper get away, get away
So when I'm in the streets grindin ain't no need to be cryin
The best way that you can help me is to play
I won't let you down

Pilots that was gettin lazy, females that was actin crazy
Them promoters that tried to play me, Mix tape labels that didn't pay me
My old homies that ain't around me, dissin rappers that came to find me
Major labels that didn't sign me, left all that nonsense behind me

[Chorus (K-Ci)]
I'm up early in the mornin, thinkin bout gettin this money
All I know's I've gotta get that paper
The hustlers told me that I gotta go and get it
Now I'm gettin it the best way I know how
I won't let you down, won't let you down, I won't let you down, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, won't let you down, I won't let you down, I won't let you down
I won't let you down
