[Verse 1]
First of all let me alert you that there's been a change of plans
Cause now my plan to put the streets into major trans
Told me I couldn't drop the real beats the way that I had planned
I'm the one who put in work don't disrespect my aching hands
Feed the streets or feed the fans you tryin' to tell me that's your stance
Better not piss the majors off you better go and make amends
Ever go against the suits Koopa you won't stand a chance
Soon as you think you ice cold you get hit with an avalanche
Jump up and down like a monkey take banana make em dance
When you do they'll take you back if you ain't down with they demands
Throw a million in the jeans tell ya that these they favorite pants
You could put em on for grands tell them to keep their fake advance
First of all I wanna extend a very humble middle finger
To those that don't take me serious like I'm Jerry Springer
I'm not that dreamer went from a schemer to ridin' beamer
I open the bag chips better be in it like it's Keebler
I'm not a diva I slept on the same floor as others
With no covers and split what I have with four brothers
You don't love us you handle us like ain't no rubbers
Impregnated your pockets so my fo-fo wanna say-ay-ay
Hello to ya

[Verse 2]
No 50-50 no Young Ro and there's no Rasaq then what do you you get
No more Color Changin' Click and a bunch of fans that ain't forget
Some of ya'll was claimin' I was the only one in the game to spit
Now that everybody's split you on the dick you make me sick
I'm not here to babysit I'm just here to make the chips
I'm just gunna make this clip first I'm gunna load then make this click
I know a couple people I could point the finger at
But every time you point a finger there's three fingers pointed back
The average joe you see will be someone who actin' shady
And it ain't no Jodeci you won't forever be my lady
No I ain't lazy but swear that I think I'm crazy
Remember every moment from every person that ever tried to play me
Before you die your life will flash before your eyes wow
Well if that's true your life will flash before your eyes now
Everyone is quite foul I get revenge you like how
Eye for an eye a bullet burned below your eye brow
I hear the drummer drummin' he told me that death is comin'
Death is comin' for you tonight just like a freaky woman
And dumbin' down my brightness shinin' now as I write this
Might I remind you that being smart made me quite rich
Life's a B full of addiction with a coke body
Got complaints but I am respectin' her, so Holly
How could I let a clue so obvious flow by me
From the jump Ro told me that he would be a nobody
Maybe I'm rehashing my thoughts just to get a response
They say that bad publicity is publicity that you want
Who wanna jump repin' with it I'm the one who distribute this crack
Cause I live it so you gunna get it just how I give it
And you suckas at the top we gunna talk in a minute
I'm posted up on the block bout to get on my pivot
Was never in love money I thought I was but it all was lust
They cut the budget but it's okay we shall adjust
No failure cause success is a must
When I clean up I won't ever forget to wipe down the dust
So dust your shoulders off and get your favorite recipe
Get in the kitchen with me we gunna have a special feast
Everyone that don't know tryin' to tell me what's best for me
Deep in the game you in the bleachers trying to referee
So when they ask for a clue and what's next with me
Command and Control is number two and the sneak attack will be number three
Don't say I didn't warn you
