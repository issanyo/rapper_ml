[Singing]
Hopped in my porscha then I asked if it was all good if could come through
You didn't sound excited and you just responded you can come if you want too
I didn't like your tone of voice so I responded I gave you a rain check
I wouldn't a said it if I knew that you would hit me back and say yeeeeaaassss
But tell me whens the last time I did what you want
And I now I'm sittin on chrome outside of your home
They say it took a long time for man to be wrong
But for some reason I don't think she'll stay that long

[Verse]
I didn't even yell when you was yelling cause I thought that would help
When I'm right I'm wrong and when I'm wrong I'm wrong bout somethin else
When I say a thought that I think is smart how come it's never felt
When I pull my card out for your heart how come it doesn't melt
But it use toooo, we was youthful
Better tighten those loose screws cause I'm feeling like you never let me stay neutral
Feeling like you hated this wonderful life after I introduced you
And I'm finna go cookoo tryna figure which nest that the bird just flew through
If it ain't you, then it must be
Something dealing with me, something that I can't see but you got me stevie wondering in hd
Told me the blind can't lead the blind, but I don't get it
I met a blind lady that knew where she was headed
Look at my ride, happiness never seen my debit
I can't confide in it but I could easily sell it
Such a corporate girl, coulda bein my porscha girl
Coulda bein my I want the world and I'm a give you that in portions girl
La zan za ee zen za layy
Cause I don't really got nothin' left I can say

I'm done now
