(Here lizard, lizard, lizard... Where are you?
Unnhhh, Koopa!
Hey Watts!  I bet you a thousand dollars I won't say anything about my rims this time... Listen!

Smack the face off ya face, and that's all it takes
For me to make burner-boy, take my verse off his tapes
Koopa's iced out, lights reflect off the face
Prolly could cough on a plate and make frosted flakes
Ladies like me, knees weaken like a walkin' baby
Yall niggas is lady-like like a walkin' lady
You might not watch MTV or Carson Daly
But you can watch them TV's in my car son, daily
Caught ya baby, in a akward position
She was missin' but when you found her, her panties were missin'
Tried to snatch the chain like a ice crispy treat
And snap, crackle, pop til' ya drop and hit the street
Mmm, I don't think you wanna give Fabian a bad look
Get ya jag took, beef in a minute, he's a bad cook
There will never be a true happy ending like a bad book
When you keep tryin' to subtract all my dollars like a math book
Act a ass, look..Me and Gu-U in a true blue;
Denali prolly while you probably lookin' for a new boo
Thuggin' wit Lewis too, not just cuz he can rap
But cuz he can wrap his knuckles around ya neck and snap
Oops call a ambulance
You boys don't have a chance
Bust shots at the ground just to make ya family dance
Sittin' crooked on my rims, damn..did I say rims
Damn..did it again, aww man Watts, you in

(50/50 talking)

50/50, Lil Twin...
You feel me knockin'?  Well let me in
Matta of fact, watch me like a stop watch in a washateria...
