[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Hallelujah, the God's back, but don't twist the interpretation
More than just Ridin' Dirty, please pardon the reputation
Don't stress cause we getting blessed, they ain't part of the congregation
They can talk to the Devil, to Hell with they conversations
Most of 'em just be talkin', tired of hearing speeches
Keep the opinion if I didn't ask you to give a thesis
Scripture says every man is made in the likeness of Jesus
Froze all the holy water, flooded my Jesus pieces
So I stay gleamin'
You ain't even playin' the game and you talking like you Skip Bayless
Criticize he who made it, calling it entertainment
Difference with you and Skip is you ain't the one getting payments
Talking 'bout practice, we talking 'bout practice
The nursery rhymes they spit is was what I can do backwards
The rocks that I got, been palming them longer than Shaq's fist
Doing deals with Volkswagen Global while walking in Saks Fifth
I keep on reppin' that Texas, I rep it, they say its local
People who normally hate you, the best you got to promote you
Normally it's a person that never came and approached you
Hope that ain't how they quote you, I'll choke you out of your vocals
Everything that you worked for, everything that you have
Everything that you got can all disappear in a flash
To be honest, I'm nowhere as big as back in the past
But no matter where I end up, I'll have more than your lil' cash

[Verse 2: Drake]
It bothers me when the Gods get to acting like the broads
Guess every team doesn’t come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y’all
I just ask that when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all
Don’t be ducking like you never wanted nothing
It's feeling like rap changed, it was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge
Me and my G from DC that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge
Me and my man Oliver North that's how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga
I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty M’s
Kobe my nigga I hate it had to be him
Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym
(Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym)
Tell Lucian I said "fuck it", I’m tearing holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix and take her ass out in public
Ordered her the filet, told 'em butterfly it, she’ll love it
She used to soda and nuggets, she really just out here thuggin'
I'm just hittin my pinnacle, you and pussy identical
You like the fucking finish line, we can’t wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that
Young rich motherfucker getting mine off rap with my niggas
