[Intro: Chamillionaire]
Pretty messed up everyday your heart stay bleeding, bleeding, bleeding
It seem like every other day she's telling me she's leaving, leaving, leaving
I think we just rushed into this because we just moved to fast
Na naa na naa
And this is why they just don't last, don't lassssst, don't last

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Come on
You know I be moving from chick to chick
Tryin not to get too complacent
Figured you never chased it
Stuck your fork in a steak and
At 7 we dinner date and at 8 you was penetrating
You looking for ventilation
I'm back on the interstate and
Must a had me mistaken
I am in a commited
Type of relationship where you usually don't admit it
Usually go and get it, use it to hit and quit it
Usuing the same ol tired excuses you never did it, come on
You know that excuse il work everytime
Cept the time when you use it and then she tell you your lying
Silverwares not too use cause she sending them dishes flying
You ducking dodging like busta when tyson was in his prime
Get down
Wait a sec this ain't usually how it happen
Usually I be witty, usually you be laughin
Usually when your cryin I usually think you acting
Usually take my money and using as a napkin
Type of relationship where your usually never wrong
Even sexin a groupie while pocket dialling ya home
Breathing all in the phone, releasing after the tone
Ya even and got her screaming and squeezing yea as she moan
Who's listenin all alone, obviously it's casper
If she was there when you entered you would of asked her
But she's faster turn your living room till disaster
Stopped and asked yourself what the hell she do all that for
Past ya, when you was flippin but you was listenin
To that ol new edition, made ya feel you was pimpin
She was missin as quick as lebron after the decision
You swimmin in other women kept taking your talents fishin
Walk in and see ya spot and got turnt to a demolition
Who woulda known that Frank Ocean would be your new competiton
Might a met a magician, might be a muscian
Ain't gotta woman left just yourself and it's intermission
Singing

[Bridge: Chamillionaire]
I was just tryin to go through the motions
I didn't really think she catch on to me
Thought I was smoooth, I know nowww, I know noowwwww
That's how ya lossee, I know nowww, I know nowwwww, huh

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
I'm up early cause ain't enough light in the daytime
Smoked 2 sweets and sold 3 chickens for the clock right now
Big your holder my boulder smolder on the p.a pipes
Ak loaded as I get tore up on the city lights
Jackers be looking shife
So I look shife back
Can't show no weakness we be buckers get your life jacked
Mayne it's a trip where I stay especially for me
The lawness try to lock us up for the whole century
The gave my boy diet 40, dante 19
I wished that we could flip again and take a tight lean
My world a pimp and Bun B man I ain't no liar
My man rodo just lost his baby in a house fire
And when I got on my knees that night to pray
I asked for why he let these killas live to take my homeboys son away
Man if you got to show me love cause god just might take em home
Cause day there baby and next day they gone

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
That's a pretty big trunk
On my lincoln town car ain't it
Big enough to take these broken hearts
And put em in it...
Now I'm driving round
On the boulevard trunk bleeding
And everytime the cops pull me over
They don't ever see them
They never see them
And I've got this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a fune-ral
5 more miles till the road runs out

[Hook Frank Ocean]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'm a try to swim from something
Bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good
And swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good
And swim good
Good

[Verse 4: Bun B]
This world we living in man it ain't nothing but drama
Everyone wanna harm ya
In new york brothers gettin shot for bombas
Now they got your life in a bomba
They ain't like california playaz witness a hydophonics
From promoner gangbanging got the ghetto hotter than a sauna
Now of course my homie bugs died on the corner
Behind a 5 dollar dice game
I saw him once before he died I wish it was twice mayne
I remember being 8 deep walking to the crib
Letting us act bad not even caring what we did
When we lost him I knew the world was coming to the end
And I had ta quit lettin that devil push me to a sin
My brother ben in the pen for about ten
But now it look like when he get out I'm going in
So now I walk around with my mind blown
In my own lil zone cause one day your here the next day your gone

[Hook]
