[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Yeah, I was just walkin this (yes), while y'all was talkin this
Burnin up the bootleg market, like I'm an arsonist (yes)
Had to get smart with this (yes), studied and sharpened it
Plot gets darker than the thoughts in a coffin get
Remember I walked into L.A. Reid's offices (yes)
Had to walk outta there feelin like I was not the ish
But they didn't owe me nothin (yes), gave me no promises
But the industry still gonna see me, I promise this
Universal Records (yes), I'm wreckin all the lists (yes)
The crane can't even lift all my accomplishments
Even when I was indie, was bringin y'all the hits
Actin like I was crazy, I got a conscience kid
In a interview they would say you look kinda pissed
Up against the world, middle finger for all the continents (yes)
F. Koopa, what's the best of my compliments?
Indie label, the hell with slavery, I'm all for this (yes)
Like this the damn thanks I get
And thank you, I'mma just focus on the bank I get
Used to be with Paid and Swisha, but I made my "Click"
The game greazy, that's the reason why I think I'm slick (yes)
Lets take it back to the beginning, when I wasn't winnin
With women and gold grinnin, my pockets were so thin and
Chamillion, before the million, no candy and chrome spinnin
Amazing how things still go sour, with no lemon
I'm poor baby, of course little nigga tacky
My Jordans isn't matchin, of course my little hair was nappy
I remember how the rest of the boys was lookin at me
The day that I got cut from the core, like it made 'em happy
Cause your spot is yours (yours), now my locker gettin clean
Not good enough for my team, not good enough for my dream (what?)
Exactly what it is a dream, I acted like a triple beam
Was under the rap game and I turned it into a scheme (yes)
Now when they speak on me, they say it's about the
Time that he's got his props, hate when these niggas doubt me
Now your with your spouse, she used to diss me and now she
Missin teeth, lookin like she been kissin on coffee (yes)
I should take your confidence, throw it up in the air and gun it down (down)
But I don't knowin that was goes around, always comes around
Now everybody wanna come around, givin a brother sound
Now you speak just cause you seein how Koopa run it now
