Na, na, na, na, na, na, na hey
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
They said no when I told them that
I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually
I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me
They always try to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge
The sound of revenge, the sound of revenge
The sound of revenge, revenge
Yeah, on the path to find out whose true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
'Cause that's really the only person that can judge
And critics people that wanna see you fail
Will tell you what you can do, shouldn't do or must do
And when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really bugs you, ha ha
Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you just feel like you have to sin to win
Sometimes it sound like, it's what it coulda been
And when you get to the gates of heaven
They probably wouldn't let you in, ha ha
But to change that meaning
Of it success is what it is in the end
And instead of worrying about
What it should of could of or would it been
You turn you head towards the future and keep it movin'
You know what I'm sayin'? Well say it again
Keep it movin', you know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then know what I'm sayin'?
If you waitin' for me to fail
Your time is running out on the Glock
I'm runnin' to the finish yeah
When I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have
But now I tell them look what I got
But this the sound of revenge
The sound of revenge, the sound of revenge
The sound of revenge, revenge
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na hey
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
The sound of revenge
