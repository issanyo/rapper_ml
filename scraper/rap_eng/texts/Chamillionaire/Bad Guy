[Hook]
Cause I'm the bad guy (bad guy)
Cause I'm the bad guy (bad guy)
Cause I'm the bad guy
They getting mad, they pointing at me (ha ha)
They gon' be mad why
They gon' be mad why
They gon' be mad, cause they'll never be me
Never, since I'm the bad guy
And I'm gonna be the best damn bad guy that I can be


[Verse 1]
Look around and you'll notice that I'm surrounded by soldiers
Them other niggas can stay away from me, I call them roaches
Them scared suckers, they scatter when they see trouble approaches
Some hate me cause I'm the realest, some hate me cause I'm the coldest
No, don't be scared of the soldiers, no, don't be scared of my homies
I'll beat your ass by myself, they just out here rooting for me
So anybody got a problem, speak up now or just hold your peace
No knife and no batter please, just bring your fist to the beef
Some call it beef that I have, I call I beef that I had
See me in the streets and don't speak, like your teeth in a glass
Know when you're heated and mad, but you get no reason to pass
Cause I feel like teaching a class, how quick I can beat your ass

[Pre-Chorus]
They keep telling me I look for trouble
But it seems like trouble just follows me (hey)
So there's drama everywhere that I go
Cause I can spot a hater a mile away (hater)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Don't get it twisted, I'm feeling like if it's
A need to get physical, it'll get critical real quick
I'm the nigga they fear, they point at me like they wanted me
Like a beat down is gonna be what they gonna put on to me
Hate that they're feeling happy, mugging and grinning at me
And thinking 'bout at getting at me, that won't happen here, lil' daddy
Police is even as mad, seeing me creeping in SLAB's
Scanner that beep on the dash, while they still peeping my tags
True public enemy, niggas know the description of that
Usually be in the 'lac,  platinum teeth and be black
But I stay peeping all that, I'm riding clean as a whistle
Registered, passed the inspection, insurance, see it's official

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Most of them niggas you see around, scared to tell you what's on their mind
Most of the niggas you see around me, ready to, ready to put it down
See niggas gonna attack your name, but that's all they attacking, mane
Ain't really going to click-clack the thing, in other words they actors, mane
When cameras on they don't act the same, they switch it up and turn back to lames
The bad guy is who they have to blame, y'all talk when they ask your name
You don't see them messing with me and some will say cause they ain't trusting me
Ain't cause you don't mess with me, I don't mess with you, nigga, I'm sucker-free
And the subject they discuss is me but they don't say that stuff to me
They stick to the subliminals but I feel like you speaking just to me

Get a weapon and put it right into your palms, you're invited to the slums
Look at your partners, niggas done got you walking around like you the Don
You can get beat down 'til your bloody, wondering why'd I do you wrong
Your heart trying to keep it real, your brain reminding you to run
And the streets get angry with me, get ignited through the drums
Beef included cause I do it, not just apply it to a song
