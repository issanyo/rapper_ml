I bring that Major Pain

(All black everything)

The game won't be the same

I bring that major pain

(All black everything)

The game won't be the same

Pockets fulla stacks
Yup
Walk around with heavy jeans
Money on the line
I'm a pick up when my celly rings
Child, I'm ya destiny like Beyonce and Kelly Team?
Get her wetter than the weather that the broken levy bring
She noticed my earring was way larger than a belly ring
Betta take off that wedding ring
Cause I don't want that head to sting
Think you got the best head that the Dirty South has ever seen
Than go down down
Like that old-school song that Nelly sing
All the plates on them say Kupa
Foriegn cars
Introduce ya
That's Barack
That's Michelle
And that there is my Martin Luther
All black hoopy train
Wait for me to enter lobby
All black Mazariti
Hard body
No Keyoti
I ain't never met a Robert
But I'm friends with a Deniro
Also international
I can get it in the Euro
Girl I gotta real big ego
Plus I'm colder than sub-zero
Boy don't try to be a hero
Shoot a bullet through a needle
I bring that Major Pain

(All black everything)

The game won't be the same
