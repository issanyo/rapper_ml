See? There's a big difference between them and me
They're loud... and obnoxious
You know, the type to do a lot of yelling in the crowded parking lot
The guys that never really do much of nothin'
Me?
I'm the one in the background, the quiet one, the deadly one
The one you gotta worry about!
You can just call me... your connect
As long as nobody gets outta line, everything'll be just fine
So listen, I got a proposition
See, it's time to cut out the middle men
Matter of fact send my condolences to the little man
I gave you plenty for free
Now I'm givin' you a skip taste of additional product
You sit with it, you come back, I'll give you a higher grade
You put it out on the streets for me
Untapped, untouched, uncut raw!
Anyone can give it away for free, but there's value in gettin' them to buy
That's how you know you're worth it and that's the difference between them and me
You're my new distributor and I'm your connect
If you don't accept this offer you have 20 seconds to press eject
My trap house is chamillionaire.com
This is where you come and get your Ammunition
You get it directly, from me
Remember the rules!
Only speak on a dead phone and only call me on a red phone
And by the way
When you see the middle man [gun cocks]
Give him a gift [silenced shot]
[body drops] from your connect!
