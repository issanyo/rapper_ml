[Hook: Chamillionaire]
I wanna show all of my haters love (hey!)
This song's for you (this song's for you)
If you had it like me and I was in your shoes
I'd probably hate on me too
See when you're gettin big cash stacks, all the haters hate that
'Cause they hate to see you be successful
I want to show all of my haters love
So I wave to you like, good morning, ha-ha-ha-ha-haters
Good morning. Ha-ha-ha-ha-haters, good morning

[Verse 1]
Yeah, today gonna be a good day, I'm feelin like I'm Ice Cube
I'm wakin' up like "can't nobody mess up my mood"
Knowin I'm a boss, I'mma do what I choose
If I was you then I would probably (hate of me too)
If it's true (true), that money is time, then watch this
Ain't tryin' to run out of time, so I purchase some watches
Y'all sick, the chips got the haters nauseous
They chicks jumpin' in my whip like a mosh pit
I wish (wish) I could be affected by any hate but I can't (can't)
'Cause I just get effected by the bank
It's great (great) to never know the feel of bein' fake
I awake, then I go take a visit to the sink
Uh, dirty money got me sanitizin' my hands
Lord knows what the previous owner did with these grands
Yeah, I ain't sayin it just to brag
I say it so you can be motivated to get the cash

[Verse 2]
Hold up (hold up)
Success is a woman, I always had dreams of sexin'
If wantin' her is a crime, just take me in for possession
Even in a recession, I'm leavin' a good impression
Reflection on the rims, so they can see they expressions
I'm busy, man, you need to schedule an appointment
Haters on they job and they act like they enjoy it
Wake up in the morning, now hop into my foreign
Walk into the bank and it's just like a house warming
Hey, we get the money by the minute
They said we couldn't do it (do it) but we already did it (did it)
I'm fresh outfitted and my Benz got kitted
'Cause I get-get-did it and you did-did-didn't
I admit it, I'm really 'bout to show you how I do
If you know that you a hater, this dedicated to you
You hatin' my last move, I'm way on my next move
See they hate to see you be successful

Good morning, morning, morning...
