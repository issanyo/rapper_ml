[Intro - Chamillionaire - talking]
(Rapid), here lizard, lizard, lizard
(Ric), Mi-Mi-Mi-Mi-Mixtape Messiah man, it's the final chapter
It's the final chapter, it's the final chapter (Rapid, Rapid Ric)
I'm the greedy genius (hold, hold up)
(It's the, it's the, it's the, it's the, it's the, it's the, it's the)
You in the presence of the finest (Chamillitary mayne)
It's the final chapter
Believe me, Chamillitary and we more than hype
Four out of ten Texas rappers are some Koopa prototypes
It's the, it's the, it's the, it's the, it's the final chapter
(Mixtape Messiah 7, here lizard, lizard)
It's the final chapter

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
This is part two, caught you, sittin in the dark you
Know that I'm a nightmare, it ain't really no need to argue
Sharpshoot, sharp pum (*gunshot*), bullets that will carve you
Keep on mean muggin man, I hope your vest is hard too
This will be a message to all those who say they Texas made
I confess I got the best of all mixtapes that Texas made
Really ain't nothin left to say, I don't got to step to A
There will only be a 100 copies, all the rest is fake
For many years they complained when I dropped 'em late
So I had a attitude, I purposely would switch the date
Some will hate, I know I'm great, some will go eBay the tape
I gave you a 100 dollar bill that you couldn't even break
They tryin to drop me late, like wait until December
But I can't wait for Universal to get their ish together
It's like whatever, you never should eat with the Devil
But when I go I'll be the greatest Houston hustler ever, ever

[Outro - Chamillionaire - talking]
Yeah, she what I had to realize is
I'm not very good at waitin for people to make moves
I'm from Texas
Home of the players that know how to break the rules and make the rules
You know what I'm sayin?
We've been doin that before anybody came in the game
Before the fame, before all that
So why don't we go back to what we used to do, huh?
Take control, King Koopa, Mixtape Messiah 7
