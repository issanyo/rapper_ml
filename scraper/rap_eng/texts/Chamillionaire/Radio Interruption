[Chamillionaire] + (Female)
This for the streets (Nah this for the radio) {*3X*}
Well if it's for radio then just keep it street (Well go on do it then!)

[Chamillionaire]
Nah that ain't a problem at all my man
Got a lot of rubber bands, time to count up all my grands
Well go on do it then - put a ninth caller in
Now we got a lot of jams, we gon' play a lot of Cham
Well go on do it then - she can say she is not a fan
Tell me she ain't got a man, plus she got a lot of damn!
.. And she love how the Impala can
Change a bunch of colors like you lookin at a hologram
.. She wanna ride off on 24's
Butterfly do's raise up, she feelin so..
Special and she like my music better slow
Tell me that I'm fin' to blow, I reply to her "I know!"

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
So let me break it down and do somethin I know the ladies can feel
She say she's lovin my style
Turn on the radio and you probably hearin nothin but the
Chamillitary mayne
We interruptin this sound just to let you hear a message from me
I'm representin the South
And know how we get down, know we gotta keep it gutter and street
(Go on do it then!)

[Chamillionaire]
I got a white girl, I call her Shady/Aftermath
Cause she love a rapper, see a nigga she gonna snatch him fast
Fine and you can't say that she don't have an ass
Plus her eyes green enough to even up and match my cash
Hispanic college girl that love to dance right after class
Pray the way she back that ass up her class she has to pass
The others bad and black, take her to the bachelor pad
Crib big yo, her man's crib is less than half of that

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
Call up the DJ's on your radio
They'll say Chamillionaire got a crazy flow
My radio station doesn't play it though
Say he gotta make somethin for the ladies so

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
Relax boy, lax boy, revenge is the sound
I've made it here, America gon' have to feel me now
Hear that bass come rumblin, boys see me actin up
Also see that fast pyoom pyoom when I pass him up
Turn it up, tell the listeners to listen here
Listenin here the sickest rapper in the Southern hempisphere
Yeah, keep it gutter, suckers missin in the picture yeah
We erased them from the game, commercial rappers disappear

[Hook]

[Female]
Now they know the name that's running the game
Them boyz down in Houston that got the streets on lock
But just incase they slow and don't know
Somebody tell em the name
Chamillitary mayne
Ha ha
You got a problem? Then let it be known
You got something you wanna get off your chest
Give us a call, we're taking requests
Gon do it then
