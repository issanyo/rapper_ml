[Chorus - Soulja Slim]
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, move it slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, move it slow motion for me
Uh I like it like that she working that back I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Move in slow motion for me
Uh I like it like that she working that back I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Move in slow motion for me

[Chamillionaire]
Hold up girl lemme show ya, wanna do more then get to know ya
Control ya like a controller, hit it and while flippin' ya over
Sip it until ya unsober, or skip it if you want soda
Ya gotta work, can't be layin' under the dick and the cova
Picture me kissin' ya shoulder, and I'm movin' down to ya chest
Watch me dismantle ya dress and my hands will handle the rest
But I won't mishandle ya breast, I'ma take my hands and caress
The steamyness and sweat, will have us both dryin' in sex
You can't be my only lady, but I bet you wish that you were
Put me in the same room with her pimpin, and I bet some strippin' occur
Ya havin' problems with ya lover, you should listen to this
Just get a chopped & screwed disc, and make them hoes strip

[Outro]
They like, uhh, I like it like that
Could ya tell Ron C he got to chop & screw that
In slow motion for me, slow motion for me
In slow motion for me, put it in slow motion for me
She like uhh, could ya rub my back
And put something in my cup that'll help me relax
Pour the potion for me, pour the potion for me
Pour the potion for me, gotta pour the potion for me
