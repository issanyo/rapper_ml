[Hook: Trick Daddy]
Sittin' high, still ridin' them big whips
Still fly, still grindin', getting big checks
Still thuggin', still leanin' to the back
You can bet that, you can bet that
I ride, I shine, nigga you can bet that
I smoke, I drank, boy you can bet that
22's, 24's all we roll, I'm a dunk rider fosho!

[Verse 1: Trick Daddy]
Everyday me and my dog we wylin'
7-Tre 7-5 dope ridin'
And we ain't trippin' on nothin', just vibin'
Big 9 with me 'cuz a fuck nigga tried me
They already know how I let him go
Kill his ass and make sho' at his funeral
How the hell a O.B. gon' try me?
I'm O.G. on and off TV, see
Middle fingers in the air, tell 'em fuck y'all
Tryin to hate on my dawgs, hell fuck nah
Why you hatin' on a nigga like that
Why you tryin' to stab a nigga in his back
I know some niggas don't like this
But them niggas is the reason I'm like this
Fuck niggas done made me mad
I'm 'bout to snap and put this K on his ass

[Hook: Trick Daddy]
Sittin' high, still ridin' them big whips
Still fly, still grindin', getting big checks
Still thuggin', still leanin' to the back
You can bet that, you can bet that
I ride, I shine, nigga you can bet that
I smoke, I drank, boy you can bet that
22's, 24's all we roll, I'm a dunk rider fosho!

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Hey
I pull up Bentleys, lookin like they not annoyed
Trunk popped up lookin like a Tonka Toy
If you dont like it you know can get that Almond Joy (What?)
Deez nuts nigga, wuddup Trick, I got ya boy
I'm clickin' over, lemme tell her I got another call
Ridin' wit my trunk popped up like I'm "Above The Law"
Tires wet and nigga they still drippin' Armor-All
Tell me you gon' fall, and I ain't got to use the arm at all
Bet Daddy finna Trick 'em, finna flip the paper
Chamillinator, me and Trick we finna shred a hater
Tip the dinner waiter Trick 'em like we finna date her
Get off ya sleeves let 'em breathe like a ventilator
Hey, what can I say me and the King Of M.I.A
Finna, (Hey) finna touch ya niggas and ya finna pay
Stay wit it hey you we ain't finna play
Snatch ya off the wheels and you can watch ya rims spin away

[Hook: Trick Daddy]
Sittin' high, still ridin' them big whips
Still fly, still grindin', getting big checks
Still thuggin', still leanin' to the back
You can bet that, you can bet that
I ride, I shine, nigga you can bet that
I smoke, I drank, boy you can bet that
22's, 24's all we roll, I'm a dunk rider fosho!

[Verse 3: Trick Daddy & Goldru$h (both)]
In the club wit my dogs we wylin'
Two straight coup grey dome ridin'
Look atcha boy got so many hoes
Look in his mouth he got so many gold
I'm sippin' and I'm goin'
Whole clique, that's how we rollin'
Stay fly, stay right if you didn't know
And that's everywhere that we go
All I wanna do is
Drive my Chevy through years
And let 'em sweat the candy paint
Ain't it right, ain't it tight, ain't it nice? Yes
Niggas like, "Who painted that?"
Candy apple green, lookin' mean anywhere
Tweety seat with the digital dash
And a swat just right in the ass
They wanna know what I got in here
I got shit when it hit, betta run 'em up outta here
They ain't never heard nothin' like that
And I ain't even turned the bass up yet
I love aggressive music
I smoke, I listen to it
I drank so much, sometimes I think I need to quit but I can't do it

[Hook: Trick Daddy]
Sittin' high, still ridin' them big whips
Still fly, still grindin', getting big checks
Still thuggin', still leanin' to the back
You can bet that, you can bet that
I ride, I shine, nigga you can bet that
I smoke, I drank, boy you can bet that
22's, 24's all we roll, I'm a dunk rider fosho!
