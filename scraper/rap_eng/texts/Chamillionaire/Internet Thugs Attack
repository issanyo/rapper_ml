[Intro - Sample from "Summer in the City" by The Lovin' Spoonful]
Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck gettin dirty and gritty
I've been down, isn't it a pity?
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around, people lookin half dead
Walkin on the sidewalk, hotter than a match headdddd (*gunshots*)

[Break - Chamillionaire]
I'm gangsta, yep, you can never play me
Got the goons with me, not a Army, we a Navy
I'm gangsta, yep, you can never play me
Terrorizin suckers on the internet daily
I'm gangsta, yep, you can never play me
Log on to the 'net and I'm a be online waitin
I'm gangsta, so gangsta
I don't give a damn about these rappers, they don't pay me

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Let me set him straight
You say one more word Chamillionaire, I swear to God (God)
I'm a click this mouse pad at your career so damn hard (hard)
I'm a type this keyboard 'til you admit that you a fraud
I would post my address but I ain't tryin to catch a charge (nah)
You respond to me on Twitter, I'll let you know what it is (boy)
I don't want you to follow me cause you'll be all up in my biz (yeah)
I don't follow nobody that put up stuff this isn't his
I'm a steal one of them candy cars and drive it off a bridge, cause you weird (weird)
Always kickin knowledge like you smart (smart)
Your Twitter questions really just require too much thought (huh?)
You always tryin to brag about a purchase you just bought
I'm a disguise my screen name, so ain't no way I'm gon' get caught
When I hack into your life, you can't be snitchin at all
Naw, I'll probably chill, cause you'll probably call the laws
If you ever went to jail, they'll probably get up in your drawers
I don't want to look like I'm gay, so everyday I say "pause"
Nah, you don't want no problems boy
I had a 100,000 views on WorldStar before
I should probably pull my weapon out on camera more
Ain't a sucker on the internet I can't destroy

[Break - Chamillionaire]
Cause I'll kill you, aiyyo, aiyyo, If you ever play me
Ask around my borough they gonna tell you that I'm crazy
I'll kill you, son if you ever play me
I got a TEC-9, a sawed-off and a .380
I'll kill you, you don't even entertain me
Wouldn't listen to your newest CD if you paid me, son
I'll kill you, I'll kill you
You know where I'm at, I'm in the hood, just page me

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
Aiyyo, my man's on sohh.com, some people call him "Wreckless" (what up son?)
And even he'll admit that southern music ain't the freshest
So I'm a put some bullets in every rapper that's from Texas (*gunshot*)
Word to God son, I see you, I'm a come up on that necklace
Knock that Texas hat off, I hope you Twit pic that
When I make my way to Texas dunn, you will get jacked
'control', 'Shift', tap, tap, cause you whack, get smacked
"F-U-K YOU!" in all caps, take that (*gunshot*)
Cause nah you ain't right, you don't spit that Black Thought (thought)
You ain't on my rap radar, you don't spit that real talk
And I tell you that you soft cause you ain't from New York
I put hollow points in every single vehicle you park
Ain't no questionin my thuggin, "L-M-A-O!"
I'm the most thugged out person that I know
No wonder Texas screwed up, you dudes too slow
And I'm a hit a million posts if I get two more
So I know, I'm doin somethin productive with my life
Which internet chat room will I be clubbin in tonight?
I'm thuggin on thisis50, I'm live thuggin on Skype
Allhiphop.com, I'm thuggin it as I type, aight?

[Break - Chamillionaire]
I dare you, highly unlikely
For you to leave the house or even put on your Nikes
I dare you, highly Unlikely
That you will come and see me, you will probably just write me
I dare you, highly Unlikely
But if you feelin lucky go ahead and get hype G
I dare you, I dare you
Nah, I don't want no problems, I know you can out type me

[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire]
Sincerely apologize to all my internet thugs
Just don't shoot, I don't wanna die of internet slugs
Make a sucker feel tough for what the internet does
I know you post your craziness to get an internet buzz
I know you tryin to say what's hot and never been in those clubs
I know you hustlin on the 'net and movin internet drugs
But ain't no snitchin cause I'm different, I ain't givin you up
But that's beccccause, (aiyyo, what you say to me son?), you just an internet thug

(*Gunshot*), blaap, blaap (*female screaming*), Twitter that
Haha, word to mother son
