[Intro: Chamillionaire]
Rock star, rock star, rock star, it's rock 'n' roll
I got ladies that love my ladies
Haters that hate my haters, I'm a Chamillionaire
But got billionaires for my neighbors

[Bridge 1: Chamillionaire]
I been having paper, I been having stacks
The crowd screaming louder in every city on the map
Got the groupies going crazy, they don't know how to act
I bring them backstage and tell'm baby just relax

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Rock on, they see the jewels is so sick, like flu spit and flu cough
Take it off and you lost, the tough talk get tooled off
Keep the 4 iron near, keep on thinking that it's for golf
Nickel plate on your head, silverware's food for thought
The Grammy winner the haters is like, 'How could this happen?'
On the red carpet so much they mistake me for Aladdin
How I'm a rapper with revenue like a rock star?
If I'm near you can believe the black card is not far
'Teen Spirit' ain't what they smelling, they yelling 'Where That Nirvana?'
The crowd is rocking and rolling, them swishers full of marijuana
They judging me like your honor, ya daughter's here with her mama
They tell me that I'm a charmer, more freakier than Madonna
Famous look right at me and said, “Know why I got my lighter up?' (Why?) Cause like the throwback P. Diddy alias, I'ma puff
See how we rippin' up tickets that police be writin' us
Do like Michael Jackson's complexion Mr. and lighten up

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
Ladies love it when your living like a rock star
I got them screaming loud as they can scream and coming out bras daily
Ladies love it when your living like a rock star
She's saying she's in love with me and she is probably your lady

[Bridge 2: Chamillionaire]
Like a rock star, like a rock star
Ladies love it when your living like a rock star
Catch me getting into trouble like it's my job
When they listen to the cops come then I'mma ROCK ON!

[Bridge 1]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Rock and roll fly, bitch behold I
I am the shit, hear the commode cry
Hear the guitar scream, that double R lean
And if it's for me, then it's foreign
I mean my cars, I mean my clothes
I mean my hoes, I mean my flows
You dress different 'round me, then I'ma clean your nose
Step into the line of fire, jalapeño toes
Compared to big foot, you just twinkle toes
I get ya girlfriend wet like wrinkled clothes
Rock star like, money, drugs, freaky hoes
World tours, walk throughs and TV shows
My hair's out, no shirt
I stage dive, I crowd surf
I'm a Hot Boy, I'm on my hot shit
Reporting to you live from the moshpit

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
I'm so cool, I'm so smooth, I'm that dude, I'm so fly
Groupies telling me like a spy, the ground be telling me that I'm fly
The cloud see me and they cry just to get a glimpse of I
Got Mother Nature so jealous she knockin' pigeons out the sky
Can't help it, I got 'em rocking they pelvic bones and losing clothes
The higher my album sales get, they love me
That's right you nailed it, they treatin' me like I'm Elvis
Naked pictures she mailed, she licked on a stamp and melted
So save your rap for the rookies, because there ain't no rappers here
A show you do in a club is a show we do in the amphitheater
We packing stadiums, ladies come in, I'll introduce ya
It's too packed to maneuver, crowd look like La La Palooza
We outshinin' the losers, know I ride with the Ruger
You know I'mma producer, weapon upside your medulla
Got no time to seduce a Superhead type of seducer
Groupies trying to snake me, but Koopa denying Medusa's

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]

[Outro: Chamillionaire]
Rock on, rock, rock, rock on, rock, rock
We gonna keep on rocking and rolling until the wheels fall off
Know what I'm talking about? Chamillitairy Mayne
Young Money, we the new Red Hot Chili Peppers
We on fire, sold out arenas tearing up tour buses
You know how we get down, rock on, hold up, hold up, hold up
Trying get the Ozzy Osborne paper Man
I'mma throw a pool party, me and the Playboy bunnies
Gonna be swimming in a pool of a paper like Scrooge McDuck
You're invited, if you can swim, rock on
