[Hook]
Soon as it get dark (dark)
We can hit the town (we can hit the town)
Let ya sit down (let ya seat down)
And we leanin', we leanin'
Pull up in my car (carr)
Turning up my sound (turning up my sound)
Let's ride around (let's ride around)
And we leanin', we leanin'

[Verse 1]
Uh
Went got the crib in Cali but still pay the Texas taxes
I live with heat in case they try to stick me like a cactus
I took the spur and put the custom paint on just for practice
They sleep on me but I'm never sleeping like what's a mattress?
Teller's the only girl that call me by my government
Make a withdrawal by tomorrow I'll probably double it
I left a stack in the Benz and valet discovered it
But I also left my strap in the back so yea I recovered it
Shout out to Short Dawg, both short dawgs
I'm jamming that Pimp C I'm bout to knock some doors off
They say the cost of living's high that's why I pole vault
Over the money till she's lying there no cloth
Look how we do can't say them boys from Texas ain't the trillest
I hit em with a "What the heck you talking bout?" like Willis
Or Gary they ask me how profitable that my deal is
I say forget the deal let's hit the streets I'm bout to kill it

[Hook]
Soon as it get dark (dark)
We can hit the town (we can hit the town)
Let ya sit down (let ya seat down)
And we leanin', we leanin'
Pull up in my car (carr)
Turning up my sound (turnin up my sound)
Let's ride around (let's ride around)
And we leanin', we leanin'

[Verse 2]
(Sunday morning pulling out my Benz, I'm looking good)
Yea I know I rep Texas where we talk reckless about the checks and addicted to gripping wood
All-star weekend she talking 'bout freaking
Wet as a pool then I go hop in the deep end
Til ya insides weaken and ya can't stop reaching for cover because ya feel like ya need help breathing
Never be more than a fling cause you and your little sister
Always want to be next to it like morticia
Cause I'm 10 times crisper but I'll never kiss her
Price will always come after that like Fisher
But I ain't feeling that plus when I let that ceiling back
She gone forget that she ever wanted to get a stack
Like aye and your ceiling that the fat lady likes it's a rap
The streets will applaud I hit the corner and hear em clap

[Hook]
Soon as it get dark (dark)
We can hit the town (we can hit the town)
Let ya sit down (let ya seat down)
And we leanin', we leanin'
Pull up in my car (carr)
Turning up my sound (turnin up my sound)
Let's ride around (let's ride around)
And we leanin', we leanin'
