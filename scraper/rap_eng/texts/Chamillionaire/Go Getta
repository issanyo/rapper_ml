[Intro]
Let my top down, I'm feeling fine (go getta time)
Money on my mind, it's go get it time
Go get it time (go, go, go getta time)

[Hook]
Hop inside my droptop
Now you're rolling with a winner
Now you're rolling with a winner
I think it's about the time to come up on some more figures
More figures, more figures, more figures, more figures
Point me to the dollar signs
Told my girl, I'm sorry I won't make it home for dinner
I won't make it home for dinner
I'm hoping to go getta
Go getta, go getta, go getta, go getta
Grinning off the dinner time

[Verse 1]
I picked up the phone when I heard the call
(Heard the call, heard the call)
She was talking about "What's up with you?"
Hope that you gonna go to church tomorrow
(Church tomorrow, church tomorrow)
Then she said "Boy don't work too hard"
But that's like trying to tell me not to work at all
And I get it, knew that I'd be gone for a minute
Everything was hard and independent
Had to turn a penny into a quarter
And a quarter into a dollar
And a dollar into a ti-ti-ticket
Clock's still ticking
Better know it's my time
Jump like you oughta get shot down
Even superman can catch a hot round
If I'mma fall off then it's not now
Been the type to leave confidence
So y'all can keep the weak compliments
Boarding jets on these continents
Serving shrimps with no condiments
Try to catch up, my mind is messed up
I hope you never caught trying to get them
My crystal ballers said I was next up
My hunger makes me feel like the best of
The current class, y'all nerds is last
If you wanna win you gonna earn your pass
I'll take your purchase, rip off the tags
Throw in your swag and then burn the bags
I don't roll with losers, just show and proofers
We don't like to talk cause we show (we show)
It ain't dinner time when it's winning time
So if you try to win then let's go, let's go

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Ain't nobody controlling us
I know you want to try to shoot me down, oooh, oooh
Then you better start loading up
Cause you gon' have to shoot way more rounds
Oooh, oooh

[Verse 2]
Walk into the office like daddy's home
Make them treat me like Mr. Combs
Execute my diddy dash
When the business' done I'm already gone
Proper sizing about getting dough
Skipped the city, let's hit it globe
Don't really drink and don't really smoke
The Moet and Cubans came with the robe
Let's get it, let's get it
Told my crew to let's get it, let's get it
You ain't down with me, I ain't down with you
So you can wear the shoe if you fit it
Admit it, tell the truth and admit it
Took my style and laced it with poison
So the joke is on you if you bit it (you bit it)
I'mma got a mail without no stamp
And I still give mail without your stamp
And this might alarm you
But I'm still as calm as I have ever been
Without your camp
Without your money, no hand outs, no bromance and co-sign
The road to riches look so bruh
But the profit from it, that's so mine

[Hook]

[Outro - Throwed]
Ugh
Rolling through the city with my mind on my business
Got a couple dimes that keep on dialing my digits
Saying I'm trying to witness, I'm trying to witness
Gotta go and get it and ain't got time for ya misses
Hold up
