Yeah!
It's the name they say is running the game
Chamillitary mayne
Flip in the building!
So go ahead and hand over the torch
Super producer Scott Storch
And of course
I'ma show you how to get your shine on
(Get your shine on)
Turn it up the DJ playing my song
(My song)
Everybody keep on calling my phone
(My phone)
Which one of y'all am I gon' take home?
(Take home)
I'ma show 'em how to get the club crunk
(Club crunk)
Give 'em something that's gon' rattle their trunk
(Their trunk)
Tip ya cups up until ya get drunk
(Get drunk)
Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up
Give me that million dollar beat
And let me show you what to do with it
Who that is?
That's the illest rapper choppin', screwin' it
Couldn't snatch the game is what they told me, so I'm provin' it
Put the truth in Texas with Scott Storch and you got you a hit
Hit and never miss rep yo click and throw 'em high
'Cause Chamillionaire's the answer to the game like Allen I
Middle fingaz to the sky, if they don't like that reply
â€~Cause any DJ that deny is a mother fu**** liar
So give the ladies what that want
Got 'em racin' to the front of the stage
To feel the bass and tell the DJ turn it up
(Turn it up)
Yeah Sound of Revenge saying Universal to get my plaques
Rappin's dead so I'ma bring it back
Like DJ's do when they hear my track
Check out my track record, they'll say I'ma track wrecka
Hotter than a black pepper now that I am back nigga
(He's Back)
You can't get mad if you feel that you ain't cap fit ya
Drop the biggest stats ever so don't let that **** hit ya
I'ma show you how to get your shine on
(Get your shine on)

(Club crunk)
Give 'em something that's gon' rattle their trunk
(Rattle their trunk)
Tip ya cups up until ya get drunk
(Get drunk)
Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up
When it's time to hit the club I let my chain hang
If they got clovers on they neck we in the same gang
I'm 20 deep in V.I.P. puffin' mary jane
Splinters still in my hand from my woodgrain
I got homies on the West who like to gangbang
And I got homies on the East who do the same thang
I told Johhny put 50 in my panky rang
5 karat diamond chain VVS is in it mayne
You know I rep the dirty dirty where they move cane
You know we mix purple stuff in that blue drank
Hpnotiq, big bodies with blue paint
We got Big Oomp spray, but it still stank
You a lame so yo dame playin' mind games
I'ma pimp so I stay in that mindframe
Niggas talk shit until I let that nine bang
Me and Duke in that Maybach switchin' lanes
I'ma show you how to get your shine on
(Get your shine on)
Turn it up the DJ playing my song
(My song)
Everybody keep on calling my phone
(My phone)
Which one of y'all am I gon' take home?

(Rattle their trunk)
Tip ya cups up until ya get drunk
(Get drunk)
Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up
Headed to the bar
(I'm headed to the bar)
You know I'm V.I.P
(You know I'm V.I.P.)
And since you're rollin' with a star
(You're rollin' with a star)
You're V.I.P. with me
(Chamillitary)
Ha ha
Chamillitary the biggest threat to
Any of these rappers that thinkin' they doin' it
Who that is?
That's dem boyz from Texas that always do it big
Multi-colored diamonds got us shining they say our jew'ry sick
Houston got a problem and you don't want nuttin' to do wit it
Do ya, kid?
I ain't think so I'm tippin' slow
When my trunk is liftin' up look at the neons as they glow
Groupies never givin' up they be everywhere I go
When that elevator go up to my suite they there fo' sho'
Told me that she didn't care about my money, wasn't hearin' it
Looks can be deceiving as Chamillion paint appearances
You know how we do it at home or schoo' and purple syrup is
She got turned out quicker than my power steering did
I'ma show you how to get your shine on
(Get your shine on)
Turn it up the DJ playing my song
