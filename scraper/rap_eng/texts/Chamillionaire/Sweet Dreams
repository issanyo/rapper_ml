[Hook]
Close your eyes I want you ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes I want you ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes I want you ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes I want you ride the skies in my sweet dreams

[Verse 1]
B king says it's time to go collect dough
Ching ching baby you know how the rest go
Hideaway
Scratch your ears ringing like you on the front row, where the preview step show
I only want the word after Creflo
New rappers gettin dough, I ain't stress though
They always make room on the show
But the people always pay a lot more for a retro
The retro King OG
I'm not really the type that might sweat you (nah)
The money will always be near
The dough was my girl
And I'm like Kefno
I'm riding Jen and paul wall and riding white walls
And we driving white tesla
I came to dream, with that cream but gliding on rims
I climb, I Clyde Drexler
Legendary in the “H” get your stats up
Money longer than a new Amadalac truck
I don’t really see them out the city that much
But see them tweeting like they tryna get they hats up (what)
Got pledge for my sketching when it’s backed up
But first of all you better go and get your plaques up
The funny thing about all that
Ws when you do get it done they gonna try to tell you that’s luck

[Hook]
Close your eyes I want you ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes I want you ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes I want you ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes I want you ride the skies in my sweet dreams

[Verse 2]
Yow, yow, hold up
I be doing shows every week in the last five years
I don’t buy cars and I don’t trip
Deposits on deposits dollar dollar bills
Next year i’ll be sitting on a mil,no bullshit
It’s like you still getting it correct like it’s “02”
Still running this club, shit them hoes told you
Niggas talking down
But they ditch up behind
Say she got my dick poking like a pair of 84 too
I was talking to what’s in the Dallas
He told me club guard you ain’t got no challenge
Nigga you got all the hits
Powers told me nigga never sell my publishings it will make me rich
I'm a underground king like I'm born
Underground king like a pimp
Mixtape my style like I'm Cam
Club godzilla, chinese people screaming god damn
I told these niggas I ain't going nowhere like herpes
Get money till they hearse me
When i was 16 the MPC curse me
Beast hit your ass hard in the head like church sleep
I got legends calling me a legend
But I can't repeat it cause niggas will say I'm cocky
Am in a slam jam in off side eleven
B king caller house studio we behind
Hold up

[Hook]
Close your eyes I want you ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes I want you ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes I want you ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes I want you ride the skies in my sweet dreams
