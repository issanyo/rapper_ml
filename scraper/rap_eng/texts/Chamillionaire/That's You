(Talking: Female)
We not rich like y'all that's one thing y'all goin have to understand
But one day this year, we will be
Because we have Barack Obama

(Hook: Chamillionaire)
Haters hate they can relate
I'm shinin and living good
I got haters all on my dick
Try to take my chips
I wish you would (I wish you would)
I know boys goin playa hate
But I still keep my mind on the do
And it don't matter cause I don't really mess with you
So what'cha need to do is leave me alone
That what it is

That's You
Playas get choose as the groupies try to pick me
You standing around me try'na pretend you with me
(I ain't F-ing with you)
Look at this stripper that's conversating with me
Ain't working but act like you ain't finna tip me (Damn skippy)
(That's You)
Calling with all of that begging on my phone
Like the message say "get to begging at the tone" you know that
(That's You)
Always be whining bout how I did ya wrong
Then your the reason I jacked this song
I ain't F-ing with you
You got dreams of being a famous artist
This every rapper that made it like they garbage
(I ain't F-ing with you)
Always got negative stuff to say regardless
That caddy clean but I don't like the way it's polished
(I ain't F-ing with you)
Always be bumpin like you finna do something to someone
But when they show up they do nothing, stop frontin
(That's You)
Know you a hater that's end of the discussion
You mad cause I got a lot and you got nothing
(I ain't F-ing with you)

So what'cha need to do is leave me alone

I'm sick and tired (I'm tired, I'm tired)
Of all your lies (you liars, you liars)
Let me live my life (my life, my life)
Cause I'm goin get mine
Don't F with cha so you get denied
I'm a tell you for the very last time

Now who am I? I am super fly
Super I'm bout to come out that suit and tie
Bout to come out that coat without that roof and I'm wishing you goodbye
Haters try'na bring me down, they look up and shoot the sky
Mixtape God cause I go hard but not one you can crucify
Here's a checkmate when you reply
Sixes got me super high
Buckle up your buckle bet my muffler goin palute the sky
Bring these rapper in the room I bet'cha one goin lose a life
Keep a pistol or some dice, who wanna play truth of die?
