[Intro: Chamillionaire]
Oooo, girl you look so good it's a shame, a shame
What's your name, ooooo let me get to spittin my game, my game
Playa made

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire & Bei Maejor]
[Chamillionaire]
Yeah, I'm tryna get a triple double
I score quick tell the coach that I don't need a huddle
Mmm, I'm tryna get up in some trouble
And get it wet enough to leave ya layin' in a puddle
High school first time I got suspended
I took off your suspenders then I had your legs suspended
Got caught by the super intenedent
But you already finish he ain't stop what he intended
Yea, when other boys tried to get ya
And they walk up to ya ya tell em get the hell up outta my face
Cause they lames, and I'm playa made
I hit it for forever if ya ask for it (ask for it)
Put my city on it like my passport
Just live ya life cause they'll tell ya that's short
While I'm scoring points I'm a slap it like a blackboard

[Bei Maejor]

I told you, not to push that thing on me
If you know I want it

You know what you doing baby

[J. Cole]
Yeah, invitations in the whirlwind
We both bad at it
Told myself no more hittin' niggas girlfriends
That's my old bad habit
Here you go, wearing that
Already know, what you staring at
I mean from top to bottom your body is problem so
Somebody better take care of that
And who
Better than, the nigga let 'em in
When your man ain't home, you can let him in
Late night Letterman
