[Chamillionaire over Gorilla Zoe's Lost instrumental]
Let me tell you what happen man, it going just like this

I'm crawling slow
On some new fo's
On the way to the mall
Next thing I know
Man here we go
Just got stopped by the law
"Hello mister hater, I mean mister officer I wasn't speeding at all"
And here go my papers
And my registration
How come you won't let me ball?

Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
Calling back up now here come the dogs
I started losing it
I started losing it
I'm yelling loud like I hate you laws
Now they removing it
Now they removing it
Taking out everything they saw
Now you feel stupid trick
Now you feel stupid trick
All of that working you found nothing at all

I guess I'm used to it
I guess I'm used to it
I guess I'm used to staying on the grind
Can't just watch you get it
Dreaming bout doing it
I'm making most cause I got to get mine
I guess I'm used to it
I guess I'm used to it
I guess I'm just used to haters talking down
I'm never losing it
I'm show and proving it
No matter what I still got to get mine

My ex-homie called my homie and told her that she think I'm lonely
Benjamin Franklin's my rodey it's obvious that you don't know me
I knowing that y'all ain't goin catch up with all these condiments on me
I keep toppings in my wallet what'chu call that, gawp-a-moly
Keep a Angela Jolie rating my tone like she own me
But I'm knowing that a white girl could try to do me like Kobe
Really just try'na get my Moby will tell you the parts that she show me
But soon as she show me she told me that "that's for her and me only"
Mistletoe on my belt cause I know your chick's superstitious
Ya misses kissing my bridges then I make ya misses do dishes
It's my matomble you dumbo it ain't no block on my riches
If the conversation is ballin' we the only one hitting swishes
Every mixtape's like crack, and they knowing that I'm the best D-boy
And if it didn't come out right, then you didn't get that from me boy
Who the master it's me boy and I'm feeling just like I'm Bruce Lee Roy
She said that money is ugly and my pockets looking like evil

I guess I'm used to it
I guess I'm used to it
I guess I'm used to staying on the grind
Can't just watch you get it
Dreaming bout doing it
I'm making most cause I got to get mine
I guess I'm used to it
I guess I'm used to it
I guess I'm just used to haters talking down
I'm never losing it
I'm show and proving it
No matter what I still got to get mine
