Hey yo Koopa what's up man, this is Lil' Josh man
I'm calling from Cleveland, Ohio man
And basically, I'm just calling to let you know that you know I'm saying
Up here, y'all boys is the only thing that we really jam
Know I'm saying, Koopa I'm a huge fan of the old Chamillitary Entertainment
Click movement man, that I can rap you know I'm saying
I know you prolly get people, that say they could rap all day
You know I'm saying, but I'm tal'n bout I can really really really really...

[Chamillionaire]
Ain't really knowing where you going, but you going through it
Ah you love to go to the studio, devoted to it
Light up a swisha nigga, get a sweet and blow it to it
Cause this year gonna be a year, you'll be sure to do it
I know ya going through some thangs, trying to get in the game
But you complain, cause these rappers that you hearing is laim
And it's a shame, that ain't nobody seeing your pain
It's like, and tears never show in the rain
But you don't hear me though, like the music really low
You love rap mayn, but you don't feel the gimmicks no
You feel like you a real nigga, when you spit a flow
Everybody'll be on your dick, when you finna blow
Yeah-yeah, you know I hear ya mayn
Situation ain't changed, mayn it's still the same
You trying to get at Puff, you trying to get at Dame
Plastic crack in the trunk, trying to get a name
But they diss you, everytime you approach the guy
How you survive, you can't sell a c.d. mo' than five
Trust me, they couldn't feel your pain mo' than I
Keep on grinding for it, and your money multiply
I, use to scrabble raps up in my pad
No do' just hope, yep that's all I had
And my family, they didn't like it that's why I was mad
Couldn't live up my own dreams, that's why I was bad
Bad yeah, and you could color me bad
But now the screen looking green, and they shoving me that
I hear him scream bout the cream, but it doesn't be fact
Cause it's only a few that's true, and really does it with rap
That's the truth, that y'all would never hear
Cause the picture they try to paint for you, is never clear
Paint the pictures I see right through it, like it's Ever-clear
You don't know the truth when you hear it, get a better ear yeah

(*Faith Evans*)
Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it, let it take you away
And be hopeful-hopeful, and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy, but that's ok - 2x

(*singing*)
