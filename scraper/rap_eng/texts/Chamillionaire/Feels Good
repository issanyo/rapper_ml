Damn it feels good to rep the texas
Cause independent money whatcha can't make
Eating lobster with the steak, about to let my bumper scrape, if you relate then you'd be jammin screwed tapes
Damn it feels good to rep the texas
To stay with the most swagged out paint
The caddy lookin like a tank, I'm bout to get my trunk to crank, it's coated lookin like some syrup got drank
Damn it feels good to rep the texas
Cause in the underground is where we spit flames
Cause we invented swang and bang, and this is where they sayin mayne, these boys leave the city stealing our slang
Go on look into my duffle bet ya can't see the dollars
Wasn't't super good at math but with the grands I'm a scholar
Bein about a dollar, bout to slab the imparlour, when I'm walkin through the club you know a bad b'l folla
Where my nawfside texas made boys il never ever hate
Cause we too busy tryin to run the region and the state
Scrapin plates, take a date, in my delta '88, conversate, then I'm tryin to see if she can educate
Gettin brain on a set of super poked out swangs
Bought it from my dealer this my super coked out chain
Boys switchin lanes, steady grippin on that oak grain, boys navigatin and bought everything with cocaine
If you spill drank on your clothes it ain't nuttin new
Back in '92 southside didn't have nothin blue
Chopped it up with a screwhead sayin whut it dew
And then he hit that frenchies for that number 3 and number 2
I remember swangin in the parking lot at max's
Careful where you park it cause the trucks will tow and jack it
State is always hot so I ain't never need a jacket
Like we in jamaica cause that maker maker packed it
Hit that sharpestown but we always get distracted
She from 3rd worth but she told me she an actress
Tryin get some practice, let me stick it like a cactus, lay it down lay it down like these hoes worked for mattress
Mac matter fact kappa we was in the truck, riding buck gettin bucks, listenin to drank up in my cup, hold up, texas is the only state I trust but be careful who you cross retailation is a must
