[Intro - Akon (Chamillionaire)]
See I remember I was just loner
(I was just a loner, I was just a loner)
(But I told them haters) "Look at me!"
(I dream, you Dream, We all Dream big dreams)
(I dream, you Dream, We all Dream big dreams)
I'm on top permanently but I stay in the streets (Harmony baby)
And I won't stop bringin that heat
It's my dream (I said it's my dream)
I said it's my dream... ooh

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Big as Barack Obama soon as he hit that podium
Always speakin that real these rappers is Nickelodeons
Say he ain't got the streets look at them killers voting him
Periodically charting music be mixed with sodium (chemistry)
See they hate him and they love him like he Kobe
And he just be getting money while haters be out there promoting him
Pick a Mixtape Messiah then open it and you'll notice him
Cuz he be talkin trash like he want to be a custodian
The God of mixtapes make sure that your kids blessed
You think that I sweat money the way that the kid dress
Show them I get checks just look at the wrist (Yes!)
My jewels the color of urine just give me a piss test
I'm so unsanitary my heater is in a corner
Diamonds always exposed I roll with that Arizona
Heater be hibernating come wake it up if you wanna
Doctor resuscitating to wake you up from a coma (Clear!)
Same channel no it sure can't be I'm so HD and you just so ain't me
Album coming soon just like o-k-c money music to my ears DO-RE-MI (Haha)
Ridin with no rims I call it t-shirt with no panties on
Threw some rims on it now it got some chrome pajamas on
Pull up to the club no we ain't gonna make it belly storm
It's going to be a 100 percent chance of rain on every arm
Killin the mic you ain't half as dope
I'm the coldest underground need a casket coat
I'm bout to snatch the whole game from you bastards
So I'll probably write my next verse on a ransom note goodbye

[Chorus - Akon (Chamillionaire)]
Yall remember I was just a loner hanging on the corner (Corner)
Now take look at me (Look at me)
Big bossin steady stackin chips never thought that I would see this shit
Now I'm on top permanently but I stay in the streets
And I won't stop bringin that heat
It's my dream (I said it's my dream)
I said it's my dream... ooh

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
Standing up to drama my posture is like a mobster
Frazier to a hater I'll box you like a boxer
Money don't change my thoughts you're an imposter
Thought you passed me but I caught you like I gotcha
Koopa my metaphor is a metaphor
That symbolizes each metaphor like a metal door (Hard!)
And yall need to put up a better score
We making A's and we grading you with the letter four
I mean the letter F-O-U-R
Tryin to say you a G?! I'm like Oh-you-are?
Don't be talkin all them lies like I don't know you boy
Don't be talkin all them lies like I can't show you boy (Yea)
Put your money up and you can really get beat
Like blacks getting pulled over by Philly police
I just made a Hundred thousand to put in my piece
In what seems like a year but it was really a week
Ain't Lil Troy but I wanted to be a "baller"
Money on the line let me holler at the caller
Bow to the man forgiveness from the Father
For waking my eye at one of Reverend Run's daughters
Koopa and they respecting it highly
I came in to the game they did their best to deny me
Hungry CEO success is salami
Success was on the sandwich and it was yellin out "Try me!"
After that Ra-ta-ta-ta murder she wrote
K-Slay and DJ Drama said "I heard that he dope"
Chamillionaire[dot]com done the fanbase is a cult
L-M-A-O your fanbase is a joke (Haha!)
Laugh while I bask stacks of that cash
Every time I wreck so they ask for that crash
See the airbag, the Jag, the lac cash
Try to say that I be preaching well pastor is now mad
I'll make Reverend Run move and that a step to the left
Cuz I'm the best of both me's that's the best and the best
It's the Mixtape God put the rest of them to rest
Press pause for the Gob and confess that your blessed

[Chorus - Akon (Chamillionaire)]
Yall remember I was just a loner hanging on the corner (Corner)
Now take look at me (Look at me)
Big bossin steady stackin chips never thought that I would see this shit
Now I'm on top permanently but I stay in the streets
And I won't stop bringin that heat
It's my dream (I said it's my dream)
I said it's my dream... ooh
