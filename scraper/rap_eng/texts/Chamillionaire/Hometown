[Hook: Chamillionaire]
Hmmmmmmm, in that H-Tooowwn
That's where the trunks go up
And the drop tops be coming down, coming doooown
See other women look good
But without you it ain't the same, ain't the saaame
Girl you be looking so good
On the hood of my candy thang. candy thang

[Bridge: Chamillionaire]
Candy thannng, candy thannng
Hmmmm, candy thang
Candy thannng, mmm

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Ladies watchin me, watch me
Drop my top and she, and she
Looking good so I'm gon spit my game
Boopers watchin' me, I see
Screwed and chopped CD, CD
That's how it go down in that H-Town mayne

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Tippin down, popped up, yuhhh
Gotta hit that frenchies chicken
Gotta hit that bulldrose
Cause I gotta stay full it takes hard work when you working these new vogues
Ya'll living on pluto
That car ain't even fresh
My dick too big, my car gotta stretch need a slab you can't compress
And the dash look like a desk, so pull ya rulers out
And when I pull out the garage just say the rulers out
Don't act like you the south, cause you ain't nowhere near it
I'm the mixtape god making all your brauds catch the holy spirit
Amen

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
I seed out the face
They tryed to knock our taste
Then they tried to take it
Now it look like they came out mistakes
Police watch me plates
Screwed and chopped the tape
Gotta let my top deflate
And now my 5th is bout to scrape
As I watch her body twinkling
She can tell just what I'm thinking
I'm a get her so wet up till her neck
Cause she probbaly think she's sinking
When the kush get hot it's stinking
Cause these boys be out here banking
Putting racks on racks will have ben franlkin looking like he planking, h-town

[Verse 4: Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, yeah, it's just Ciroc in the cooler
Not a day off but I'm still Ferris Bueller
Winners never lose so how dare you confuse us
They quote what I spit like Confucius
He say, She say rumors all day
The rap game is high school and life's a hallway
Like what click you in, the Beamer or the Benz
The Bentley or the Lambo
Like here we going again
Don't sit at my table VIP I got this
If you ain't poppin champagne after every game then don't pop shit. Homecoming queen, with my picture in her locket
But I know what's up with her hands in my pockets
(Money)
They love me cause my Swag is so Jockish
Freshman year, sought a ring like I'm boxin'
You voted most likely to never-ever top this
I'm Michael Jordan; Dennis Rodman's... in my hometown

[Bridge: Chamillionaire]
I seed out the face
They tried to knock our taste
They tried to take now it
Now it look like they came out mistake
Police watch my plates
Screwed and chopped the tape
Gotta let my top deflate
And now my 5th is bout to scrape

[Outro: Chamillionaire]
See other women look good
But without you it ain't the same, ain't the saaame
Girl you be looking so good
On the hood of my candy thang. candy thang
