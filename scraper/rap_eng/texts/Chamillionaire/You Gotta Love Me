(Rasaq Chorus)
(You And You And You And You And Your Gon Your Gon Your Gon Your Gon Youre Gonna Love Me)
Sittin Back Huh? Waitin For You To Act
Tryin To Speak A Niggas Name In Your Rap Huh
Till We Run You Out The Game Get Your Raps Took
Dont Remember A Niggas Name Not A Fact
Snitchin On Your Own Gang Thinkin Thats Hood
Tryin To Diss The Color Change But Can't Rap Good
Tryin To Say They Run The Game Got It Backwards
Cause The Almighty Color Change Ain't Havin That Huh
(You And You And You And You And Your Gon Your Gon Your Gon Your Gon Youre Gonna Love Me)

(Chamillionaire Verse)
For Runnin These Gimmick Niggas Out Of The Game
I Dont Need A Reason Cause It Was Time For A Change
For Havin The Nuts To Diss You Speakin Your Name
Instead Of Subliminals Like I Ain't To Blame
For Switchin The Style Up Now I Speak With A Purpose
Instead Of Just Speakin About My Rims In My Verses
The Fake Shall Fall And The Real Shall Rise To The Surface
I Bought Your Cd But The Purchase Was Worthless
The Hottest Buzz Along With Bun B And Me Truthfully
Only Niggas With A Buzz As Big As Gorilla Mob, Slim Thug And Boosie
Im Tired Of The Gimmicks, I Am The Realest Yall Niggas Is Goofy
I Miss That U.G.K. Free That Pimp C, Man Let The Truth Free
I Heard That E.S.G. Fixin To Drop Scarface The Truth See
If It Ain't In The Same Sentence As Niggas Thats Real It Dont Include Me
Were Gettin The Money They Thought I Was Through Until 1 2 3
I Drop My DVD So Im A Baller You Got Hoop Dreams

(Chamillioanire Talking)

And It Ain't A Shot At Paul Dont Try That Nigga. I Wouldve Said His Name

(Rasaq Chorus)
(You And You And You And You And Your Gon Your Gon Your Gon Your Gon Youre Gonna Love Me)
Sittin Back Huh? Waitin For You To Act
Tryin To Speak A Niggas Name In Your Rap Huh
Till We Run You Out The Game Get Your Raps Took
Dont Remember A Niggas Name Not A Fact
Snitchin On Your Own Gang Thinkin Thats Hood
Tryin To Diss The Color Change But Can't Rap Good
Tryin To Say They Run The Game Got It Backwards
Cause The Almighty Color Change Ain't Havin That Huh
(You And You And You And You And Your Gon Your Gon Your Gon Your Gon Youre Gonna Love Me)

(Rasaq Verse)
Im Sittin Back While You Drap And You Act
Like Yo Niggas Sellin Crack On The Tidwell And The Trap
You Ain't Done Nuthin Or Seen It, Im Tired Of These Gimmick G's
Only Time You Used The Triple Beam Was In Chemistry
Ask Anybody I Remember It Vividly
You Was At The Gas Station Pasing And Soliciting
Dissin Me? This Pussy Is A Peon
Before You Rapped With Watts You Was In A Purple Neon
When He Speak Youll Be Sayin That Its Hate
How Could I Let A Pussy Nigga Rep For My State?
This Nigga Said He The King Of The Streets
So Ima Speak Now Not Forever Hold My Peace
It Ain't Just Him Man A Bunch Of Niggas Weak
They Could Say It Over Beats, But Won't Say It In The Streets
And If Yo Niggas Fail They Put You On Your Feet
And When They Call Your Cell Its A Message And A Beep
