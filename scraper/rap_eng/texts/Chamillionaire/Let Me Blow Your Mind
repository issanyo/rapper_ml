[Chamillionaire]
-Uh, Koopa, Look, Look, Uh
Hope you guys got ya party, cuz after the party
I'm leavin' wit all of the ladies and that's half of the party
And speakin of after..I'ma walkin' after shock
Cuz women pass out in from shock when they see me pass in the drop
But speakin of shock..how come she calls me silkk the shocker
When I drop my silk boxers, oooh it shocked her
Ladies come to poppa
Then come for poppa
When I come in the droppa
She'll come in her boxers
If they come to the hotel, then they come to knock us
Reason she comin' home is cuz I, come to drop her
Off the boss, if she showin' naked gotta respect it
*Operator Noise* This number is disconnected, look
That's what you be hearin' every time that you call her up
Cuz she don't want you no more nigga, she wanna baller what?
Ladies if you want the Color Changin' Lizard to pay you a visit
When you lonely just holler out "Here Lizard, Lizard, Lizard"
If ya mans a asshole, I'll creep in the back door
With the latex, some whip cream, and a damn Lazzo
"A Lazzo? Chamillion please tell me what that's for?"
To tie ya man up..while he watch me spank it from the back, whoa!
"Chamillionaire, I feel em' man, that boy's a damn villian
That boy chrome be spinnin' like a fan on the damn ceiling"
Spray ya mind, 'tre in the 9, make em' all stay and line
That call me "This little light of mine", because I shine
I know I talk alot of noise but I promise I'm not conceited
Sike I spit my worst rap, it ain't a nigga can beat it
Raise my trunk turn on the neon's so a nigga can be it
If you don't like me, lick the dick on a stick nigga and eat it
Blunted and weeded, cuz ? to me I don't need it
Defeated this game fair and square niggas is sayin' I cheated
But why? I'm not a nice guy
I'ma creep in the night guy
With a nice sized choppa, because a nigga might try
Abra-Cadabra, niggas gon' be mad, after da kappa
Ya girl is like a piece of cake cuz if I want her I'll have her
If I'm not 20 off the..ground and 3 from the curb
I'm 5-0-4 in a flag-ship but please don't not disturb
