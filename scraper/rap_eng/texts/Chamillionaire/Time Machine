[Hook]
In my time machine, yea I ride, clean
Marinate the scene with my high beams
Candy coated dreams, whenever I, lean
Take me far and far, this ain’t just my car
This my time machine (take me way back)
This my time machine (take me way back)
This my time machine (take me way back)
Take me far and far, this ain’t just my car
This my time machine

[Big K.R.I.T: Verse 1]
Take me way back Scarface in our tapedeck
Ridin’ with my poppa, rockin’ a starter and some gray sweats
Gave me game as we roll down the 8th street
"Niggas out here flexin’, don’t be stressing what you can’t be
And don’t be vouchin’, don’t believe in what you can’t see
Unless it's God, dont be borrowin’ cause ain’t shit free
You got your family and your friends when you need relief
There’ll come a time when I can’t be there when you need me
He lean’t my seat back (way, way back)
When it come to music yea you need that (way, way back)
Forever in the cut where you be at (way, way back)
Forgive and forget, your anger leave that (way, way back)
Don’t be wasting time, Cause time is all you have
Don’t be chasing hoes, Boy go chase this cash
I can’t say no mo’, you’ll learn it on your own"
I couldn’t understand it then
But do now that I’m grown

[Hook]

[Big K.R.I.T - Verse 2]
Take me way back, fitted with a wave cap
Brushing in the hallway trying to keep these waves flat
Broads come and go rarely would they fuck with me
My brother was a player I was favored off up in these streets
Learning who’s paying dudes made myself a name
Laughing at these cape crusader’s savors ’cause these niggas lame
Hand cuffin’, claim they lovin’ on a freaky thang
She a bopper I got partnas that done ran a train
We play the game (way, way back)
Even as a youngster knew I’d be a king (way, way back)
Told them non-believers I would never change (way, way back)
Mississippi is where Im from and that the shit I claim (way, way back)
It’s funny how they flock when they heard you got that knot
Wouldn’t bust it open now they dying to set it, out
Down to hit my couch, get off in their mind
Like Im a fall in love, Take ‘em back in time

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Uh, Uh
Hold up
I just wanna say what's up to the women they discuss
Ain't no rust, you can never say it's lust
This the only dame I trust, Ain't it plush
You can see the painted struts
Got the naked lady just painted up
This ain't no Mercedes cause, bet it make your baby blush
Coats of candy got 'em saying I'm, delicious
Every woman on her knees that's looking up, is not religious
And I feel like Master P had me not taking minor digits
If you ain't about this life then close your pipe and mind your, business
Screw taught us stay authentic and they gon' love your jams
Watts taught us Keep on mashin' and we gon' run the land
J prince and Drake are the reasons you had to become a fan
And the only way we ain't gon' win is when we under planned
Throw a prayer up for Japan, I swear the daily news be having me trippin'
Everybody that got a cross hanging off they neck is not a Christian
When the police pull you over they'll say you fit the, description
Bun B that's our O.G., R.I.P Pimp C feel like I'm with him
When I'm in my time machine

[Hook]
