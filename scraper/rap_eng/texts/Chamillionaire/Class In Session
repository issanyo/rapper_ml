You Are Now Hangin With (Chamillitary Mayne)
You Are Now Hangin With The Best Option You Got
Class Is In Session, It's Mister Koopa Baby

I hear a lot of whispering about if I'm still it
Well if I ain't the one on fire then tell me who's lit?
And if it ain't MIxtape Messiah then tell me who spit?
You probably gonna say somebody that ain't goin do ish [slow brake]
TOSIN
I am legend but I'm betting you like who Will Smith?
If any of y'all goin be the future of rap then we'll quit
Y'all sweet as ice cream I got a full clip
So mind ya manners my bananas goin make sure you split
Make em get pissed ya call em some piss-gitters
Keep a duece-duece ya call em some ditch-diggers
Keep hard Chris Bills I call em my stick figgas
And I don't curse but God hate us a call em some...
First they try to tell me I won really repping Houston
My Grammy and my V.M.A. let me introduce them [slow brake]
First they try to tell me I won really repping Houston
My Grammy and my V.M.A. let me introduce them
Bad chicks that used to turn me down like I was gruesome
Now they all up on my dick cause my rim done grew some
Ha Ha, I'm feeling Trilla then I ever been
Dissinagrate hate ya left with no skeleton
Death ain't prejudice, race got no relevance
My lyrics bring back either race with two senisance
Yeah, and I ain't really caring who you with
Homies ya put on try to cross ya like a Crucifix
Homies ya put on are ones that were saying you the best
"Put on for my city" but look how quickly you forget
Ha Ha, and putting on I'm the king
Shoulda, woulda, coulda, you ain't goin do a thing
Step into the room no ignoring my bling
I'm the Mixtape God call me Lord of the Rings
Retarded money, stupid paper is Koopinator
I told'cha it's motivation so I'm recruiting haters
I been the greatest you talking like you can save us
If you can save us, how come you can't get to the majors?
I'm Houston Lakers, L.A. to Houston earning riches
Got Houston acres, Real Estate money I'm the realist
They say a pic worth a thousand words I'm burning pictures
Cause I ain't with all the words, I'm more concern with digits
The rappers is like Cadillac coupes cause I feel
You can come out but need to be dropped the same year
Be a lyrically ya sub name a rapper I can't kill
Got it lined on my bullet insert his name here
TOSEN or TOSIN I'd rather call em TOSIN
Cause TOSIN rhymes better with the words I use for Bow-ston
Like Procan, Procan's a word I use promotion
The way my shiny swaggers thick and way out in the ocean!
