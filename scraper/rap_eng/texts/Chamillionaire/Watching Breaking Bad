[Intro]
Watching Breaking, watching Breaking Bad
Watching Breaking, watching Breaking Bad

[Verse 1]
Became a street millionaire, my girl had to pay the price
Got mad cause I wrecked a car then I went back and bought it twice
The kit came with all the pipes, the fibers the carbon type
So I couldn't resist it she can't tell me, who's wrong right
A hell of a temper the type to walk in a bar and fight
I feel like my lawyers employed to give me the wrong advice
You must think that you're Walter White, well my rocks looking awful bright
And my pistols named Jessie Pinkman cause he'll be my dog for life
I would tell you more but that'd be a new conversation
Warning labels says no informants where harmed in the making
These fakers think that it's friendly they must have got me mistaken
I'm in the empire business, the streets are mine for the taking
The mixtape music mogul, you should know who to go to
But don't really matter I'm still gonna cake through the mobile
These kids ain't moving global, the fakes ain't doing total
Amounts of the product so we can still come through and show who
The Houston Tex Heisenberg, that poison what I'mma serve
A whole bunch of students and all movers disguised as nerds
Hop in my ride and swerve I pull up beside the curb
Cause I'm so good at cooking and when I'm cooking do not disturb
I'm headed home after work, so glad that it Friday
My woman just made it home and her cars in the driveway
She's always emotional she threatens to fly away
But I'm the man of the house so she gon' do what I say
Right here in my living room my La-Z-Boy on recline
She's always suspicious and plus she thinks that I'm always lying
Don't talk about loyalty she's more loyal than y'all combined
I'd call her a dime if she wasn't nagging me all the time like

[Hook]
Now just tell me where we're you at the other night
Tell me why you keep on asking questions all the time
I already know (What?) so don't even lie, (I don't lie) you can't deny
Stop it cause I'm not falling into your trap
What type of stalker question is that? (So just tell me)
You keep on asking where I was at (So just tell me)
But ain't no need to ask me where I was at cause I was home watching Breaking Bad Breaking Bad

[Verse 2]
What the heck are you talking 'bout, can I please get some breakfast
You talking all reckless like I ain't the truth from Texas
Thin line between love and hate you should carefully thread it
Anyone looking for a problem can come here and get it
And that's the moment I see her making a face that looks so familiar
She ain't saying nothing now but her face says I'm gonna kill ya
Then I respond to her saying I don't know what you're referring to
She swung like she tried to turn my face to a convertible
And she missed me, man she's lucky she did see
If that punch would'a hit me my patience would'a been history
Started giving her quotes like no weapon that's formed against me
That just made it get worse but she'll have to calm down eventually
She said I knew sneaky that day you pulled out that missile toe
Then I had to check you like what you looking at my sister for
You think I'm invisible, did you see me kiss her, no
Then why you accusing me like this is something I did before
How what I did Christmas Day even get in the picture
Cause you begging for trouble you tried to sleep with my sister
Only time that I'm begging is when I'm begging to differ
Why you gotta be simple? What you running ya lips for?
I'm not feeling ya tone of voice all this stress isn't needed
I got plenty work to do you won't let me complete it
I put the food on ya plate if you don't like it beat
Keep on bringing this subject up and you won't ever leave it
Alone you keep nagging me, like it's such a tragedy
That I'm cool with ya family you shouldn't even be mad at me
See tripped on the sofa and accidentally straddled me
And I wasn't even kissing her, she was showing me her cavity

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You ain't see me nowhere promise you ain't see me
I was home on the couch sitting watching TV
Sitting watching TV, sitting watching TV
I was home on the couch sitting watching TV

[Verse 3]
I told her watch how you talk to me, you need to be calming down
They hear you from up the street, the neighbors can hear the sound
Of you trying to curse at me, the police are coming now
Look what you did woman, the police are coming now
Help me hide all this green, there ain't no I in team
And your jealous eyes the most jealous eyes I done ever seen
I made us all this cream, you bought the finer things
It don't take a genius to see this a baby mama's dream
Need to stop treating me like a dog in the kennel
I'm the man of the house you must have not got the memo
You gone come back and cook some food we gonna watch Jimmy Kimmel
Walk outside and this woman done threw a brick through my window
I'm like you know you done messed up now, you mad I don't even care
She buckled the baby into the baby seat in the chair
She's trying to drive away, I raised a brick in the air
Then all of a sudden I heard a "freeze right there"
