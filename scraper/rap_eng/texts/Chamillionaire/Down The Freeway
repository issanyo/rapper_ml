[Chorus:]
Diamond in the back with the sun roof open
Drivin Down The Freeway
Eyes real low just singing my song
Drivin Down The Freeway
Life already bad so I'm moving along, yeah
Drivin Down The Freeway
Blowin my smoke all by myself, just
Drivin Down The Freeway

[Chamillionaire:]
Koopa
She said that she ain't never been in an old school car in her life
And you will never, not with me cause you are not my type
That Houston breathes be feeling nice, I had to drop top twice
Showin roof because they couldn't afford the top drop price
Marvin Gaye is gonna play cause what it do to the soul
The music probably goin be chopped cause Watt's done screw it to slow
I love to see the sun come out, cause what it do to the 4's
And it's ready to bring the Lincoln out cause it's too new for the road
Key to the city with me with me as I cruise to the toe
And the handles never show not including with doe
And I swear the air up there is so populated with snow
A condition blowing code I'm bout to shoot em the stove
Complaining, saying I don't be in the hood chillin with them
But when I pop up with the top they like "What's up, Cham? "
He said "let me hold something" so I took my hand out
And then I pulled it out and he like "stuck up man"
Chunk the deuce to all the haters, pictured us as a fluke
Haters better get on ya job like you was hired to do
Never open up your mouth and say that I ain't the truth
Cause you goin blow it like a fluke got stuck inside in your tooth
Ford chicks they love a Ford crosser I ain't traduce
Both of them they Europeans, get inside of the coupe
If you goin race me then I think you should be tying ya shoes
You hear that engine start roaring like a lion is loose
That's Right

[Chorus:]
Diamond in the back with the sun roof open
Drivin Down The Freeway
Eyes real low just singing my song
Drivin Down The Freeway
Life already bad so I'm moving along, yeah
Drivin Down The Freeway
Blowin my smoke all by myself, just
Drivin Down The Freeway
