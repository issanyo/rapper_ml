I got drank by the pint dro by the pound
Headed to the kappa and da boss top down
Slim thug bout to clown when i hit that G-Town
If you love me you gone smile
If you hate me you gone frown
Cuz me and my boss hoggs ?inna bigga yo dawz?
Glass fours pullin hoes up and down da Sea Wall
Crawlin' clean on da scene with a cup full of lean
Candy blue droppin screens when i swang when i swing
Fuck the cop cuz if i see a bop i must stop
And if the bitch qualify she can hop in my drop
But a bitch can't talk to us if she wasn't fuckin
You either be bout it or look and keep truckin
Thats my click motto when we up in da place
We dont want no pussy we wanna fuck some face
Run trains on yo brain
We throwed in the game
Let me see your tongue ring
Dont show no shame
You bring sand to da beach
Well not this week
We gone take your bitch
And make your bitch a freak
Put that ho under my sheets
Make her eat my meat
She getting beat in my suite
While you out on da street
Now thats deep
We hittin licks
We doin tricks
Got bitches suckin dick on some porno flicks
I dont smoke no sticks
But i smoke tha sticky green
From my mouth to my ring
All you see is bling bling
Money ain't a thing

Ice white as the white house or bright as a light house
Ask the governor of Galveston and he gon' tell ya, we ball
Bout to change the Sea-Wall to the damn C and P-Wall
All, look at the screens fall can you stunt like we? Nah
More shoes, clothes and hoes then 4 stores in the mall
See more legs, breast and thighs then a plate with 3 chickens
I don't steal but you'll get stole, ya whole set of, teeth missin'
I'mma walkin' website, internet on my damn cell
Open up my nextel, and it says you got mail

More throwed then a threw frisbee
Driving too fast you'll miss me
Cuz my twinkies made ya too dizzy
If you see us at the Kappa, on no swangers and adapters
You have my permission to walk up, to me and Sab and slap us
If I'm not in a flag ship, being jocked by bad chicks
Wearin' Gucci bag clips you can give me a ass kick
Sir Daily I stunt with him
When I'm up in the Comfort Inn
With a couple of twins, wearing nothin but comfortable skin
Might pull my cash out, Chamillionaire's a damn grouch
Screen recline and, lay down like a fat man on a black couch
I'm as throwed as a toad on a Budweiser commercial
Im Wise Er, look don't make me hurt you
Bout to change after the Kappa, to after the Koopa
Cuz when it comes to ballin', yall niggas come after King Koopa
Call me King Of The Kappa, when I'm seen in ya city
My screens fall and hang down like ya grandmama's titties

Could go platinum if I did a album with the Ku Klux Klan
