[Intro]
Venom!

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
In the streets I'm peepin' game, I can't trust you no no
All up in my business mayne, I stay on the low - low
Say they really, really fake - can't mess with you no mo'
Closest people to you hate - so I be rollin' solo
I'm creepin' on the low, creepin' on the low - low
I be rollin', I be rollin' solo
I'm creepin' on the low, creepin' on the low - low
I be rollin', I be rollin' solo - I'm creepin' on the low

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Mo' money and mo' problems
What Biggie said, it looks like it's true
Used to be my homeboys
But now I'm paid so they tryna sue
My garage got Jaguars
My garage look like a zoo
Middle finger up for the haters
Hope the hater here isn't you
I'm super cool, that's real cool
You can feel like you got a friend
But I ain't trustin' my money counter
And that's the reason I count again
You saw the force, I'm suspicious
Thinkin everybody wanna take my riches
Can't take my money out my account
'Cause my bank teller get motion sickness
Back and forth, back-back and forth
I'm in the streets and right back in court
Candy car built like a tank
And my crib built like a fort
Let's go to war, I ain't George Bush
I promise y'all I'm gon' be prepared
Cause I ain't trustin my weapon either
And that's the reason I keep a spare(Yeah)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
I ain't hangin' with none of ya'll
Outcast like Three-thou'
Win the Grammy, thank God and family
And all of y'all I'm gon' leave out
You don't like it, then, peace out
Look around and I see doubt
I been known to get to the presidents
Like Barack was on speed dial
Yeah it's all about me now
Don't want ya and don't need ya
You don't grind and get to the money
And you ain't hungry, I won't feed ya
I ain't hangin with no hater, no faker, no diva
(I) Do it big, and they say they did
And try to take my credit like stole Visas
If it's lonely at the top, I'd rather be alone
'Cause the closest people to ya
The ones who gonna do ya wrong
Backstabbin' me for a broad, promise I won't lose no sleep
Cause Jenny Craig can be yo freak
But my bank account gon' stay obese

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I be creepin lower than low
Light another blunt, and I'm smokin the dro
Chokin', locin', never provokin
But the trunk gon get popped and I'll open the do'
Blunts full of smoke, I be slower then slow
Feel like I'm chopped and it's no where to go
So I just pull out the bazooka
BLAOW! Put a fuckin hole in the floor
Luda! I'm so dope with the flow
Trunk full of speakers, pocket full of dubs
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck
If a woodchuck could chuck wood... grain?
Grippin on the wheel, turn it, turn it
Blow another sack, I earned it, earned it
Blow another amp, pull another tramp
Light another blunt, burn it, burn it
Flame it up! Hear my flow? I changed it up
Everybody grab yo gats and hold 'em
Load 'em, sock 'em, lock 'em, cock 'em and aim it up
Bang it up, off in the sky, catch me rollin off in the ride
Twenty six inches, leave 'em defenseless
Forty five always tucked to the side
Open ya eyes, see me cruising
'Cause I keep winnin' and these boys keep losin'
Plus I'm the pimp of the year
Playas is hatin and hoes is choosin'
Look at all the hoes you losin'
Then look it all the game I got
And you can catch me creepin on the low-low
Luda ridin solo, beatin the block!

[Hook]
