[Chamillionaire]
What would you do?
If he was hating on you and never to you
He gon' make sure that he don't bump into you
He gon' pretend he don't see and never knew you
And just avoid you
What would you do?
If everythang he was saying wasn't truthful
He gon' pretend that he ain't did nothing to you
See you can love me or hate, whatever suits you
But I'll destroy you, and you know it! Nigga

[Chamillionaire talking]
Nigga knew he had messed up when he put me on his DVD at the front
Nigga put me in the footage like I'm co-signing this nigga running the game
What type of disrespect is that?
I knew you that messed up nigga, caught you red handed with all your feminine ways
Running round, talking all that noise behind my back
And wasn't man enough to say it to my face man
Real type of nigga you is man
Should of known you was that broad ass nigga that everybody was saying you was
What type of hoe ass nigga talk down on his own click
To niggas he ain't even really that cool wit
What type of hoe ass nigga don't say it to a nigga face
And when he see ya he start smiling and shaking hands
A hoe ass nigga, a fraud ass nigga
You gonna have to take it how it hit you nigga
Cause I mean every word that I say on this CD nigga
You know what I'm saying?
Standing on my own two feet like always and I ain't really tripping offa anybody else
Anybody got a problem, speak up now or forever hold your peace
Oh and it will get worse, let me let y'all know I ain't done with this nigga
It's not over yet
