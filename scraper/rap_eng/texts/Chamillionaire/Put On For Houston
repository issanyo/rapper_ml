[Intro - Chamillionaire - talking]
Mixtape Messiah, August 27th
Put that on your calendar
It's Chamillionaire, I mean Koopa
AKA Major Pain, cause I'm a bring the majors pain
Mixtape master, the underground, bang
They ask me where Texas at and I say hold that thought
August 27th, I'm a get
To that
You either die a hero or you live to see yourself become the villain
I've been showin support to all the labels in my city (yeah)
But right now
It's all about Chamilli (yeah, yeah)

[Young Jeezy sample - behind the Intro]
Put on ...
Put on ...
Put on ...
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
I put on for my city, on, on for my city

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
When they see me do my magic, they say "what the heck is Koopa on?"
Texas been too quiet, so the X-Man about to produce a storm
Either die a hero or the villain is what you become
Hoppin in my Batmobile, I ch-ch-churp the Koop alarm
Salad dressing cause it's umm, plenty green and parmesan
In my pockets, in my palm, I'm about to drop a bomb
Thinkin of makin vegetation, I'm the mixtape Farmer John
So much green inside my jeans, it's like I've been out mowin lawns
I'm the real, the rest is fake, I'm the best, the rest is cake
Mixtape God I bless the tape and I put boys in they restin place (woo!)
People always test the type and they don't never test the face
That's the day I'm a be on TMZ and the day I catch a case
Think that you can take my auto and them hollows not gon' follow? (*gunshot*)
Better dream of bikini wearin genie out a bottle (bottle)
Some chicks that used to strip, ask to wax the Maserato
I said "forget the wax, just make it quick, just like Serato" (ha)
Got a spanish chick, that love the chips, she the Dorito lady
She ready to Frito Lay me, "el gusto es mio baby"
I hear some sharks talkin like they gonna D.O.A. me (what?)
Go ahead, jump in that water, promise there's torpedoes waitin (*gunshot*)
I dropped a lot of verses but I know I'm proud of mines
I see the presidents in front of me, I'm Obamatized
Rappers is politicians (yes), they all be talkin lies
Paparazzi like some Nazi, pop your posse like some spies
I used to look around me, like "it's probably you that hate me"
Now I open up my wallet and it start illuminatin
Do your damage, do it, talk your talk and mutilate me
Money talks, me and Ben always communicatin' (hello)
I know you're probably thinkin, "why he talkin all that cash?" (cash)
I write my lyrics in the crib as big as Carlton's dad's
Was happy broke but super rich and they like "boy he mad"
Every problem I had last year, my money brought me all of that
Push foreigns like a chauffeur (chauffeur), stomp all the cock-a-roach a
But back when I was broker, I sold product like a broker (broker)
My next one drop it's over (over), point out somebody doper
I bet that supersoaker flip that joker like it's poker (*gunshot*, pow)
Your boy ain't half of me, turn him to a casualty
Humble but I swear I'm not Barack Obama's pastor, see
I be talkin trash, yeah the mouth is a catastrophe
Don't mistake the humbleness for weakness, cause that's blasphemy

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
This weapon that stay attached to me, is grazin your anatomy
This gray one'll make you call a doctor (call a doctor), call up Grey's Anatomy (okay)
I be pushin cars out the garage like it's a factory
Service with a smile, serve a hatin rapper happily (okay)
Never miss a penny, you can't count your dough exact as me
Push come to shove, I'm pickin up money just like a vacuum G (yeah)
Always makin dough, got a bunch of Keeblers after me
Pro at bein active like what Puffy use for ac-a-ne
If you rep that Texas, I know that ya feel me
Want to pop, lock and dance, then put on that get silly
Want to dance until you're sweaty, put on that P. Diddy
Tryin to take the mixtape market (put on), that Chamilli
