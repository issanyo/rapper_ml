A Kato Production

[Dizzy Wright]
Turnt up walking through the door
I heard she pop that pussy on the low
We got weed, we got liquor, we got hoes
So come into my room after the show
I need a hotel stripper, hotel stripper
Hotel stripper, hotel stripper
See it's that night that Dizzy Wright become a cold as nigga
She pop pussy and pop ass, that my hotel stripper

[Kato]
Woah, hold up, hold up
Hold up, aye Dizzy
You know our fans must have heard that shit a million fucking times
So here's what Imma do:
We're gonna bring it back down South
And Imma let a true H-Town Legend speak on it for y'all
Let's go

[Chamillionaire]
Been snatching hundreds out of bank rolls
Been turning corners on you fake hoes
Been super trill, in case you ain't know
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
I'm a H-Town Legend, H-Town Legend
I'm a H-Town Legend, H-Town Legend
Kinda like Pimp, kinda like Bun
Kinda like Face and [?]
You are now in the presence of a H-Town Legend

I made a plan and than made a skrilla
Made a movie, then made it bigger
Made the one they said was demand
Go switched the plan and became the dealer
Back when Deion, where he played the Steelers
Back when Michael created Thriller
I been trill, you can listen to Bun
And you can listen to Kirko, it wouldn't make you triller
Sitting back in my favorite villa
Smoothie on the desk, say vanilla
Told my chick you put in work on this
It's like the perfect mix, it would've made you shiver
Fake is something I can't deliver
Shed a tear to y'all - make a river
Y'all crybabies really need to let me
Be the one to pick your new babysitter
I probably pick Casey Anthony
I hope they come take your family
I need to get my haters up
Because the haters really just a faker fan to me
I see through your fake philanthropy
A faker would hate to stand with me
They see that I'm stacking mil
But you lazy beggars wouldn't get a stand for free
Investments, have to pardon my absence
Cuz I refuse to let your little mini wannabes talk about me in past tense
You ain't a baller, go sit on that bench
[?], tell them, "That's French"
I took one percent and put it in my kitchen
Now all my tables got cash dents
Use to move crazy, like this ain't narcotics
Nigga talk money, but they ain't no grinders
Behind dark tents feeling like J. Prince
Every time you see me you should say, "Your highness"
Now you in the presence of the H-Town finest
The main one that made candy paint so timeless
Told me money talks, went into the vault
You could look at me and see it ain't no silence

H-Town Legend, H-Town Legend
I'm a H-Town Legend, H-Town Legend
Kinda like Pimp, kinda like Bun
Kinda like Face and [?]
You are now in the presence of a H-Town Legend
