[Royce Da 5'9"]
First verse, uh, I'm on 'til I'm on a island
My life's ridin' on the autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill y'all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been born or if you can form
Slap up a cop and then snatch 'em outta his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas's intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette with ya asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past, so that basically resurrected my cashflow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke, though I ain't wrapped tight
My blood type's the '80s, my '90s was like the Navy
You was like the Bradys, you still fly kites daily

[Eminem]
Catch me in my Mercedes...

[Chamillionaire]
..wait, let me interrupt you Shady
They thought I couldn't drag the loot, but
Y'all must be crazy. Bullets in my .380
I keep a bunch like the Bradys
Have everyone dodging shots like Anderson
Cooper out in Haiti. They all be Wolf Blitzer
And I put in a full clip and you stay in the full trip
And you run and the fool flip. I'm MJ, I don't do
Pippen, I'm lyrically too sick. Wait till you're gone
And drop a bomb on your car like a stool pidgeon
I'm with your girl in your auto
I'm letting her work my throttle
I think I just spilled a bottle of Moscato
Inside your Tahoe. Your girl is singing bravado
She think she Nelly Furtado, I keep on telling her
"Bravo!" Yeah, that's the Stephanie I know..

[Eminem]
Catch me in my Mercedes bumpin' Ice Ice Baby
Screamin' Shady 'til I die, like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll, danish, let me tell you
What this pretty little dame's name is cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus!
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum cleanin'
Try them trailer parks, crazy, I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's back with a capital B with an exclamation mark
Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
Cause I'mma rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit, cause after
I spit the bullets, I'mma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'mma kick the ballistics, so get this dick, I'mma live this

[Hook - Chamillionaire]
I'm living life in the fast lane
If y'all didn't know my name then I bet you know now
I don't really give a damn what y'all think
I'm just tryna get this change and make my city so proud
All I know is I'm tryna get it so I get in the ride
Drop the top on my drop and ride through the night
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)
I'm just tryna do my damn thing (Pedal to the metal)

[Chamillionaire]
Hey Royce I'm sorry for stealing but I had to make an adjustment
That production's so rushed they give it a Texas concussion
It's like the game of Duck Hunt when they see the heat that I'm tucking
Soon as they see that I’m squeezing
That’s when I see that they’re ducking
It ain’t no hey or Wassupin when I throw my fist through your dental
Cause I be charging the month like the card that got incidentals
I’m a a millitant mind reader I’m sawin right through your mental
Got a saw I purchased on rental
Got em sawin right through the middle
You little peons get peed on, cd what I’m a skeet on
Your thong is neon as Deion
Gotta dick so big you could ski on
Tip of my penis I’m meanest
Sometimes I think I’m Arenas
I bring my strap in arenas
This metal detectors a genius

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the Devil that says "I'll let you take me
You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpes, Jack Kevorkian"
Go back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down, my tenement, too many now
To send my serenity powers, spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity

[Eminem]
Now, was called M&M, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up.. and spitted him out, girl giddy-up, now get-get down
He's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now
Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I s-s-stutter, mothafucka? Fuck them all, he shuts
A whole mothafuckin' Walmart d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight with 5'9" to hold this bitch down
Like a mothafuckin' chick underwater, he tryna d-d-drown
Shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated, just by the way
That you keep lickin' them dick-sucking lips, I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then I'm have to take it

[Royce]
And then after takin' that, I'mma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
It's gon' say "The whole rap game passed away" on top of the affadavit
Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson' activator, meanin' I'm on fire off the top
Might wanna back up the data, runnin' over hip hop
In a verbal tractor trailer, homie this sick, you can normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Drop in the lap of a tax evader, homie they spent

[Eminem]
Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes, what girl
I'm the crack-a-lator, percolator to this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell you boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
You rollin' with a player, you won't be exaggeratin' when you sayin'

[Hook - Chamillionaire]
I'm living life in the fast lane
If y'all didn't know my name then I bet you know now
I don't really give a damn what y'all think
I'm just tryna get this change and make my city so proud
All I know is I'm tryna get it so I get in the ride
Drop the top on my drop and ride through the night
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)
I'm just tryna do my damn thing (Pedal to the metal)
