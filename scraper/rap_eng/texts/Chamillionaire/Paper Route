[Hook: Chamillionaire]
Making paper stays on my mind
I'll show you how to make a dollar out a dime
I'll show you how to make a lot of dollar signs
You gotta go and get it, you gotta grind
Haters, haters all around
If any of you nigga got a problem I'm
Not really in the mood so this is not the time
To tell me that some playas trying to block my shine

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Koopa
I'm from Houston but any nigga trying to run up on my dough
Hit you with the pistol and New Orleans initials (N.O.)
And know when I miss you the heat hit you, you know
You're family miss you but won't miss that white tag on your toe (uh oh)
We put 'em in check like royalty payments
Your boy'll be famous
When news tell the world what his name is
You gotta be brainless
Let me explain this
My vision's 20-20
Can you guess what his aim is?
Flawless
Like that candy paint on my car is
I leave your face as purple as full cup of bar is
Laws get suspicious like "What you got in that car, kid?"
My jaw is glistening they wanna kow what my job is
My rhyme is a crime
Designed like a 9
To paralyze the tip of your mind to the tip of your spine
Spit at your dime
Now major labels want me to sign
For them dollar signs
Put dollars in front and sign his behind
Go fix your mind
The Color Changin' Click get respect
If not my fist gon' crack the lens of this N's specs
Don't matter if its fightin', pistol whippin' or sex
I got that one-hitter quiter it's one hit then it's next
Yep and I just purchased some real estate
In the realest state
My next problem is niggas hate
And know Chamillion make bills as big as Gates
So I now I got construction workers buildig bigger gates
Koopa

Haters, haters all around
If any of you n got a problem I'm
Not really in the mood so this is not the time
To tell me that some playas trying to block my shine

[Verse 2: Rasaq]
Rasaq on the block
It's the number 1 dough lover
The nigga that's so gutta
I'm cold as crackheads in the bed with no covers
But raw as two lovers in the bed with no rubbers
The bread's gon' touch us so the feds don't trust us
They look at the gold sluggas
They look at the throwed brothas
No warrants to handcuff us so instead they hold grudges
Roll with no bustas
Strictly dome bustas
That'll make the chrome plucka and make you hold crutches (ha ha)
No suckas
I'm doublin' Gs clutching the cheese
Lil Flip style Suckafree (ha ha)
But trust that we got more pimp than C
And when it comes to bread we got more buns than B
Wanna get dough from Rasaq you're gonna have to sue 'em
Cause I'm all about the Ss with two slashes through 'em
Either that or click-clack the tool and flash it to 'em
Let loose a slug and pass it through 'em (ha ha)
Admit it I wrecked no get it correct
I let ten spit from the Tek Just to get my respect
Scratch that I let my fist intersect with your neck
And give it a peck (muah) now your chin in check
They say Chamillion spit it the best but this nigga is next
When I talk dollar signs "Aye" send me the check nigga
When Italk dollar signs they send me the check nigga
Rasaq on the block (chyeah)
