[Intro]
Yeah, on behalf of Chamillitary Entertainment
I'd like to extend my deepest apologies
To anyone who feels they are offended by the following content
Now that we done with all of the nonsense
If you know you're not a groupie, make some noise

[Hook]
G-R-O-U-P-I-E
Told me that she ain't a freak, told me that she ain't a freak
G-R-O-U-P-I-E
Told me that she ain't a freak, told me that she ain't a freak
You was kinda high maintenance to me
Want my paper but you'll let my partner sleep with you for free
Baby, I thought that you were in love with me
But obviously, your just a groupie (groupie love)

[Verse 1]
See I got a clue when Young Dro
Said his girlfriend got a girlfriend
That girlfriend of his girlfriend
Had Chamillionaire as her man
Then T-Pain said he was sprung
Said he had fell in love with a stripper
I shoulda known that you was the stripper
That was on the pole tugging on his zipper
Kanye said that you was a gold digger
You always wanted to be major paid
I turned on my TV and then
I seen you kissing on Flavor Flav
We was both fans of UGK
We was both dreaming bout riding blades
While I was dreaming, you was getting laid
On everybody's bed and I was getting played
Yung Joc knew that we was cool
Said he knew he didn't stand a chance
You stood still while my song played
And his came on and you did his dance
You kept begging me for romance
I kept telling you that's enough
You turned on my boy Juvenile
And then proceeded to back that up
Pitbull said "culo" and I ain't even that good at Spanish
But I knew he was talking to you
I was down with you so I couldn't stand it
Don't try to lie, don't try to cry
Ain't nothing more for us to talk about
Like Unk said take two steps
Towards the door and just walk it out

[Hook]
G-R-O-U-P-I-E
Told me that she ain't a freak, told me that she ain't a freak
G-R-O-U-P-I-E
Told me that she ain't a freak, told me that she ain't a freak
You was kinda high maintenance to me
Want my paper but you'll let my partner sleep with you for free
Baby, I thought that you were in love with me
But obviously, your just a groupie (groupie love)

[Verse 2]
Gave Bun B a lil groupie love
You gave Pimp C a lil groupie love
And then you bumped into the whole Screwed Up Click
And gave every member in the group a hug
Even messed with my boy Slim Thug
He pulled up, you had a heart attack
You tried to mess with Game and 50
But neither one of them called you back
Ask J.R., my car was pushed
To the limit on Cool & Dre
Plus Rick Ross was hustlin'
That money outcha like everyday
You knew that "I love you"
Was those three words that I'd never say
Now your business all over the radio
And it's the penalty that you have to pay
You made the choice to go and be a freak
Even Akon been smacking that
Her plan was to get ran through
By a linebacker or a quarterback
R Kelly didn't have to tell me about
Your bump-n-grind and your foreplay
I found out and I asked you
If this was true, you said "no way"
Birdman said "Believe dat"
T.I.P. was like "shawty"
Then Young Jeezy said "That's right!"
And Lil' Jon said "okay!"
Heard you was messing with Ray J
You did a flick is what they say
I ain't even wanna look at the tape
Until P Diddy said Press Play

[Hook]
G-R-O-U-P-I-E
Told me that she ain't a freak, told me that she ain't a freak
G-R-O-U-P-I-E
Told me that she ain't a freak, told me that she ain't a freak
You was kinda high maintenance to me
Want my paper but you'll let my partner sleep with you for free
Baby, I thought that you were in love with me
But obviously, your just a groupie (groupie love)
