[Hook - Bun B sample] (Chamillionaire)
Comin down candy, comin, comin down candy
I'm comin down candy
(I'm leanin on a switch)
I'm comin down candy, comin, comin down candy
I'm comin down candy
(I'm leanin on a switch)

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Hold up, I'm comin down candy (yeah), leanin on a switch (hold up)
I'm pullin up on vogues in my '84 Biarritz (hold up)
I'm slow, loud and bangin, swangin to the bricks (yeah)
My burner phone rangin, my celly got a chip (hold up)
I got the fiends beggin, tryin to get a fix (yeah)
They know I got that crack cause every mixtape is legit (hold up)
The police keep starin, they all up in my mix (yeah)
And underneath my seat I got a couple hollow tips (hold up)
Swangers twistin on that 'lac, got some chickens in the back
Where your Misses at? She missin cause she sittin on my lap
Swangers wouldn't fit but I know a way they will adapt
Ain't no trippin, if he trippin, then he fixin to get slapped
Popped up, truck wavin, catch me misbehavin
Not Kanye West but she tell me that I'm so +Amazing+
If he talkin down, I bet a black eye what I gave 'em
Then I rolled off on 'em with a set of 15's bangin
