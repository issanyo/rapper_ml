Chamillionaire:
Yeah!
It's the name they say is runnin' the game
Chamilitary remain

Lil' Flip: Lil' Flip in the building!

Chamillionaire:
Go ahead and hand over the torch
Super producer Scott Storch
And of course

Chorus: Chamillionaire
I'm a show you how to get your shine on
Turn It Up the DJ playin' my song
Everybody keep on callin' my phone
Which one of y'all am I gon' take home?
I'm a show 'em how to get the club crunk
Give 'em something that's gon' rattle that trunk
Tip your cups up until you get drunk
Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up

Chamillionaire:
Give me that million dollar beat and let me show you what to do with it
Who that is? That's the illest rapper choppin' and screwin' it
Couldn't snatch the game that's what they told me, so I'm provin' it
Put the truth in Texas with Scott Storch and you got you a hit
Hittin' never miss rep yo' click and throw 'em high
Because Chamillionaire's the answer to the game like Allen I
Middle fingers to the sky, if they don't like that reply
'Cause any DJ that deny is a muthaf..... lie
So give the ladies what that want
Got 'em racin' to the front of the stage
To feel the bass and tell the DJ Turn It Up
Yeah Sound of Revenge sayin' Universal to go get my plaque
Rappin's dead so I'm a bring it back, like DJ's do when they hear my track
Check out my track record, they'll say I'm a track wrecker
Hotter than a black pepper now that I am back nigga (He's Back!)
You can't get mad if you feel that you and cap fit ya
Drop the biggest stat's ever so don't let that back hit ya

Chorus: Chamillionaire
I'm a show you how to get your shine on
Turn It Up the DJ playin' my song
Everybody keep on callin' my phone
Which one of y'all am I gon' take home?
I'm a show 'em how to get the club crunk
Give 'em something that's gon' rattle that trunk
Tip your cups up until you get drunk
Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up

Lil' Flip:
When it's time to hit the club I let my chain hang
If they got clovers on they neck we in the same gang
I'm 20 deep in V.I.P. puffin' Mary Jane
Splinters still in my hand from my woodgrain
I got homies on the West who like to gangbang
And I got homies on the East who do the same thing
I told Johhny put 50 in my pankyrang
5 karot diamond chain VVS is in it mayne
You know I rep the dirty dirty where they move cane
You know we mix purple stuff in that blue drank
Hipnotic, Big Bodies with Blue paint
We got that oomp spray, but it still stank
You a lame so your dame playin' mind games
I'm a pimp so I stay in that mindframe
Niggas talk shit until I let that nine bang
Me and Duke in that maybach switchin' lanes

Chorus: Chamillionaire
I'm a show you how to get your shine on
Turn It Up the DJ playin' my song
Everybody keep on callin' my phone
Which one of y'all am I gon' take home?
I'm a show 'em how to get the club crunk
Give 'em something that's gon' rattle that trunk
Tip your cups up until you get drunk
Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up

Bridge: Chamillionaire
Headed to the bar (I'm headed to the bar)
You know I'm V.I.P. (You know I'm V.I.P.)
And since you rollin' with a star (You rollin' with a star)
You V.I.P. with me. (Chamillitary hey hey)

Chamillionaire
Chamillitary the biggest threat to any of these rapper thinkin' they doin' it
Who That Is? That's dem boyz from Texas that always do it big
Multi-colored diamonds got us shinin' They say our jewelry sick
Houston got a problem and you don't want nothin' to do wit it
Do you kid? I ain't think so I'm tippin' slow
Wen my trunk is liftin' up look at the neons as they glow
Groupies never givin' up they be everywhere I go
When that elevator go up to my suite they there fo' sho'
Told me that she didn't care about my money Wasn't hearin' it
Looks can be decevin' as Chamillion paint apperances
You know how we do it at home of Screw and purple syrup is
She got turned out quicker than my power steering did

Chorus: Chamillionaire
I'm a show you how to get your shine on
Turn It Up the DJ playin' my song
Everybody keep on callin' my phone
Which one of y'all am I gon' take home?
I'm a show 'em how to get the club crunk
Give 'em something that's gon' rattle that trunk
Tip your cups up until you get drunk
Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up
