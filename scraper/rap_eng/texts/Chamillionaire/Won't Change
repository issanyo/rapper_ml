[Intro: Chamillionaire]
Downtown, living in that H-Town
You know I love how you love to love me, baby

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
I ride for my home and state
Where we be riding vogues and swangs
And cups be overflowed with drank
No we don’t care what people say
My city been through so much pain
They love me and I sure won’t change
Won’t Change

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Music slow but I'm such a speeder
Tried to exit the feeder
Spotted me like a cheetah
Looked in the car and he asked me if I'm a dealer
Keep a tool and some screw so I told him I’m Bob Vila
Young Tela feeling like Derek Jeter
I’ll show your girl how I swing it as soon as I get to meet her
Hate on me from the rear while they playing follow the leader
All these Caucasian (diamonds) I must have caught jungle fever
First they love it and then they hate it
Welcome to Texas where flip-flopping is overrated
Must've not got the memo, say they're happy you made it
But they really full of hot air like the skinnies I just inflated
Hard to say RIP after timelessness get created
You’d think that we’d live forever with music that's never dated
We gon' treat every day like it's UGK’s birthday
When Bun say he’s happy you made it just tell him happy belated

[Hook: Chamillionaire]

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Yeah it's just foolishness that you hear
Some that will never get it will tell you that it's their year
Some will say that you’re finished the minute you disappear
But if diamonds could tell the future my future looks crystal clear
Can't get to comfortable when you no longer live in petty
Ordered the chicken over the Alfredo with spaghetti
She’s in the mirror for an hour say she’s getting ready
That 59 minutes that I could have been getting fetti
Ugh lets get back in the mix
You can dream about sleeping while you out stacking your chips
Stunting on em with all this candy immaculateness
They walking in houses that isn’t worth more than half of your wrist
She said this but do you think that you can run long as you did with Paul
Do photoshop make models think that they ain't got a flaw
Funny how most be talking like they did it all
And what’s ironic is I can’t see anything they did at all

[Hook: Chamillionaire & Tami LaTrell]

And you know I won’t change

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
She said that you’ve been gone for too long you know ya so crazy (Crazy)
You know I love how you love to love me baby
Now I'mma drop the top, she gon' bop, she's saying that's so amazing (Amazing)
I'm on them spokes, I just hope this ain’t your lady
Now I'mma put it down put it down for Texas and that H-Town (And that H-Town)
Say they so proud (Say they so proud)
They love how I hold on this grain
Crawling super slow on these swangs
Wit the candy coats on my paint
And the city know I won’t change
I won’t change

[Hook: Chamillionaire & Tami LaTrell]

[Bridge: Tami LaTrell]
There’s no rain, there ain’t no cloudy days
When you're rolling on swangs
They all know I won’t change
I won’t change

[Chamillionaire]
I ride for my city mayne
You know I ride for my city all day
I ride for my city mayne
And you know I won’t change
Hold up they tried to knock us but we never froze up
You in the presence of players who react like grown ups
Hold up if I would have known they would try to own us
I would went out and purchased stock in styrofoam cups

[Chamillionaire & Tami LaTrell]
Hold up
