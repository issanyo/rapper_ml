Do You Only Wanna Dance
Funny thing is when I look into your eyes
I sense something so sincere in your disguise
You whisper secrets I hear only in my dreams
Then I wake up to your tele-smoke screen
I wait patiently while you play your game
‘Cause in the end, I’ll be the winner all the same
You’ll see clearly when the song comes to a stop
I’ll be the one blowing kisses from the top
(So baby, stop) Stop, you’re surrounded
(I got my love) Love all around ya
(One wrong move) Move and I’ll down ya
And that’ll end ya
You should surrender
You’ll never win
Unless you give in
(So stop, baby, stop) Stop, you’re surrounded
(I got my love) Love all around ya
(One wrong move) Move and I’ll down ya
And that’ll end ya
You should surrender
You’ll never win
Unless you give in
So won’t you give our love a chance?
Or do you only wanna dance?
You put your lips very closely to my face
And then you run away and so begins the chase
I’ll be the hunter, but boy, you better pray
‘Cause when I want ya, I’ll get you anyway
You know what I wanna do
It ain’t nothing new
I’m tired of dropping clues
So, gonna step to you
Will you rise to my occasion?
Or will you make me change your station?
Stop, you’re surrounded
(I got my love) Love all around ya (Uh)
(One wrong move) Move and I’ll down ya
And that’ll end ya
You should surrender
You’ll never win
Unless you give in
(Stop) Stop, you’re surrounded
(Oh, I got my love) Love all around ya
(One wrong move) Move and I’ll down ya
And that’ll end ya (Uh)
You should surrender (Uh)
You’ll never win
Unless you give in
So won’t you give our love a chance?
Or do you only wanna dance?
If you take my hands
And follow my lead
I’ll make you dance (I can make you dance)
But if you get my feet (Get my feet)
And miss the beat (And miss the beat)
Then I can’t take that chance (Then I can’t take that chance)
If you take my hands (Oh)
And follow my lead (Oh, Oh, oh-oh)
I’ll make you dance (I can make you dance)
But if you get my feet (Get my feet)
And miss the beat (And miss the beat)
Then I can’t take that chance (I can’t take it)
(So stop it) Stop, you’re surrounded
(I got my love) Love all around ya
(One wrong move) Move and I’ll down ya
And that’ll end ya
You should surrender
You’ll never win
Unless you give in
(So stop) Stop, you’re surrounded (Baby stop)
Love all around ya
(One wrong move) Move and I’ll down ya
And that’ll end ya (Uh)
You should surrender (Uh)
You’ll never win
Unless you give in
(Stop, baby, stop) Stop, you’re surrounded
(I got my love) Love all around ya (All around you)
Move and I’ll down ya
And that’ll end ya
You should surrender
You’ll never win
Unless you give in
(So stop) Stop, you’re surrounded
(I got my love) Love all around ya (All around you)
Move and I’ll down ya (Uh-uh-uh)
And that’ll end ya (Uh-uh-uh!)
You should surrender (Uh-uh-uh!!)
You’ll never win
Unless you give in
So won’t you give our love a chance?
