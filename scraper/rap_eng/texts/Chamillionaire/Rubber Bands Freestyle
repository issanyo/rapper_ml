[INTRO]
Yeah, About to re-up on these losers, like they doing something
Hakeem Oljauwdon in the flesh, yes, Chamillitary, lets go

[Hook]
I need some rubber bands (4x)
Time to get these digits
Time to get these dollars
Time to get these digits
Time to get these (I need some Rubber bands)
I need some rubber bands (4x)
Time to get these digits
Time get these dollars
Time to get these digits, I'm about to re-up on these hoes
I need some Rubber bands

[VERSE 1: CHAMILLIONAIRE]
About to get back in my city
Now I'm back on my greezy
She wanna Bone and Wish for my Flesh
But that ho Krayzie tell her I'm Bizzy, get it
Heard a couple of boys diss me
Stand with me or against me
Anyone of y'all say my name
I promise I'mma make sure you're history
Lady wanna get her freak on like Missy
So I respond like oh really
But I'm too far and I'm so gone
You can tell that broad that I'm Drizzy
Man she wanna talk to me like she tipsy
She telling me that she miss me
Cause I've been around the world so much
On my passport picture I look dizzy
Where is he, where is he, he back to get it done
Cause these rappers wasn't raping how they should when I was gone
Rappers just like Ted Williams
You can claim that they the one, that's gonna have the golden voice
But I still feel like he's a bum
Made my paper without dealing
Got a crib I never live in
Just to hide it in the ceiling
Don't be dissing but i"m willing
Speak of Texas or chameleon
Just remember who the villain y'all be chilling I be killing
I'm the one who made me, you can call that man made
Help to get your bands up you can call it band-aid
I'm the president around here I can't be no damn slave
Cham be bringing pain, campaign
I'm riding porsches, they riding Avis
Got off the majors and went and copped some gauges
I'm hearing whispers like man "I ain't seen that kid in ages"
Pop up on top of my fortress shooting like Baron Davis
On the roof like Santa, some of y'all boys better calm your grammar
Before you get hit with the arm and hammer
Keep a 4 and a 9 like Joe Montana
But I ain't your average Joe though
That's just cause every rhyme is clean and timeless as a photo
Stay creepin on the low low, your chick buying me polos
I stick and move bounce on it then stick it like a pogo
They don't jam me in Soho, I respond like so ho
Your girl wanna come to my crib
And kick it kick it like a Dojo

[Hook]
I need some rubber bands (4x)
Time to get these digits
Time to get these dollars
Time to get these digits
Time to get these (I need some Rubber bands)
I need some rubber bands (4x)
Time to get these digits
Time get these dollars
Time to get these digits, I'm about to re-up on these hoes
I need some Rubber bands
