This is why you should hate me baby
Tell ya girl
I love hanging with her
I sho' ain't goin miss her
She a hopeless romantic
And I sho' ain't goin kiss her
Chain gettin thicka (woo)
My chain got a flicka
Diamonds so large I Photoshop my chain in the pictures
So many ways to tell ya how I'm paid
To tell ya bout my swangs
Parellies a new blades
Tell you I might go Geico and tell you how much I saved
I put all my cars in line and It's goin look like a parade
Diamonds got em leaning
Gravity is fighting with my ear
Letting bet the top look like my drop is fighting with the air
Leaning in my whip is like my postor fighting with the chair
Me and two chicks in the whip playing truth or dare
Yeah

Let's erase my history, my Grammy and my platinum sells
Let's erase the motorcycle and the seat that come with scales
Then some track a lot of million from my bank account as well
Then you'll probably still would be a hater hating, I can tell
Every time that you'll reply
When you talking you will lie
Any plan that go against Chamillionaire is suicide
Every verse is super fly
Confidence is super high
Stupid I ain't goin let you stop me hater
Move around
Getting money baby
Ain't goin get plenty mo
Just had to let'cha know

They said I would blow
