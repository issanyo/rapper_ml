[Verse 1: Rob G]
Bitch, I'm back and I'm strapped (yeah)
Bitch, I'm here with no fifh (ugh)
Coming home to my thrown
I pop that bottle, light up that bone
I got 5 grand in my pants
Hundred placed in that safe
Can't count what's in my accounts
Talking little money, then bounce (watch me)
Pop the tag on my swag (watch me)
Rock the ave in my slab (watch me)
Plot and smash for my cash (watch me)
Cock and blast if they're mad
Trying to hate on the fact I'm back
Stack my stacks as I rap my rap
Black on black, let me snatch that Lac
Snatch your chick if she don't come back!
Cause my swag is nice, fuck the lavish life
Bag of ice when I grab the mic
Snatch the price on the slab is white
Your cash right and that tag is nice
Thou, wow, child of that ace
I get mine that's why they hate
On the grind a while for that pile of pace
I smile from miles, riding to that bank
Rolling blow, hoes and vogues
Row and rows stand back and watch
Dopest show from around the globe
Bank roll is swole
Bass about to pop
Damn I'm hot! Caliente, fuego, miro el espejo
Lo que veo, Ray Latino, como Al Pacino
Godfather, el padrino!

Chorus:
I'm fly, I'm fly, my swag is all the way live
I'm fresh, I'm fresh, I'm fresh to death and I'm blessed
I'm clean, I'm clean, them girls be all on my team
They say I stunt, I stunt, you see them paper plates on my trunk
Fresh, fly, so cool, rolling in my old school
Paper tags, paper bags, stunting like I'm supposed to
Fresh, fly, so cool, rolling in my old school
Paper tags, paper bags, stunting like I'm supposed to

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Hold up!
What's that your fiancee?
Been had that girl bib, man
She told me she loved me, told her igualmente
Flattery get you no dough, that won't get your rent paid
But if you want to come kick it with me, I guess I'll be your sensei (damn)
Can't manage them, about 20 dimes what I'm averaging
White, Jamaican and Spanish and
I got candy on the door paneling
They like (hold up) it's Cham again
Take your girls and then damage them
Grab my jimmy in my hand and then
Tell them hold it still like a mannequin
I done sold a few
Me and Rob G, that's overdue
Everybody up, trying to call me up
Because every line from me is like a quotable
I'm unapproachable, I gotta show to do
Ain't met a girl that's uncoachable
They show you one, I'm going to show you two
I stay stunting on them in multiples
Because...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rob G]
Paper plates on my trunk
Chrome glisten on that front
Pistol grip on that punk
If you're feeling froggy then jump
Because I'm no front
Who guess is trill
Squad is fake, resurrect the real
All the same, when I check some bills
I find a Spain backdoor Brazil
Still the man, I fill the stage
Turning heads as I'm passing by
Natural swag, don't have to try
They're like 'oh man, that Latin fly!'
Cabin high, because I smoke a lot
Pour the drank in that soda pop
Lava hot with that flow I got
Stand in guap each show I rock
Better grip, you ain't as fresh as this
Stack is high, you can't match the fly
Pile of green you won't see my clean
Hoes so crunk you can't see my team
Pass your chick for show, she on dick everywhere I go
You ain't heard, let me just go
Describe myself for those who want more

[Hook]
