[Intro]
Yeah
Anything else would be uncivilized
Yea

[Verse 1]
I rip the best beat, kiss the left cheek
Not the one on the face you can't impress me
I split the Red Sea, quick as Nestle
You can't be the realest 'til it's a dead me
From the presedential room that I'm high in
The floor not the weed I'm sharpe and tie tying
You could fly private jet and die in a high skying
Lord knows I didn't wanna get rich and die flying
I think I need a (angel in my life)
But of course my soul is hot frying
They say that Ecstasy can help you with not crying
But I don't really mess with the E!, I'm not Ryan
Before I self destruct on my label, aye I'm trying
To know why every convo would start with "Stop lying"
To hell with B.S. that's never what I'm buying
See it into existence success is what I'm eyeing
The star on the track welcome to the Captain Kirk show
I am not a new boy but I can be a jerk though
Hit you in the heart, the truth is normally kinda hurtful
Hurt yo "Did I do that?" no Urkel
I bein eatin well but I still ain't had dessert bro
What the heck you get it for ain't lovin what you work for
Can't take money witcha leave you money on the earth bro
Two Jesus pieces I ain't never wore to church nope

[Hook]
I think I need a (angel in my life)
I think I need an angel
Yea yea, I think I need a
I think I need a angel in my life
The only way I'm gone feel right

[Verse 2]
Cause right now it's like I walked into the coldest night
Good Morning lifting up my spirit as I say "Goodnight"
Always bein ahead of my time
When Houston was chopped and slowed
Alotta years ago there's something that you should know
Always bein an overchiever at stunting I was a pro
I was ridin 26's when T.I. made 24's (whoa)
And no, I'm never dissing my city
Even though some people in my city do diss me
Who the hell you think you talking to dude it's me
How you ain't never did the math and try to do history
I set the Blueprint, New Print, Zero 1-2 print
Sense isn't common but I had to get a few cents
You don't know me then you shouldn't have to add your 2 cents
Say I'm nice like they don't know I use ta be a nuisence
I turn from Jekyll to Hyde like let's ride
I would just expect you to hide get inside
We can get it all the way live like 10-5
Had to 1 n park it I started like let's drive
Couldn't even block it or watch it your best spies
Couldn't even block it or stop it with ten tries
Had your body shaken and quaking like sex thighs
Open up the top, its inside and surpriseeee
