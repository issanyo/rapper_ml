(Chamillionaire Chorus)
Rap Game I Used To Love You (Used To Love Ya Baby)
But Now I Dont Love You The Same (Love You The Same)
Baby Im Still Thinking Of You But No Its Not You Its The Change
But Still Im Ridin Like You My Wife
And You Will Always Be In My Life, But You Ain't Right
I Used To Love You But Sumthin Bout You Ain't The Same (It Ain't The Same)

(Chamillionaire Verse)
I Ain't Talk To You For A Week But Thats How It Supposed To Be
I Swear To You No One Out There Loves Yo Ass More Than Me
Cause You Wasn't Not Holdin Me The Rap Game Promoted Me
Wasn't Greedy With The Attention You Made Sure They Noticed Me
And That Day That Big Watts Told Me He Was Cuttin The Members
Yeah, I Remember The Moment Clear Like The Nigga Was Standin Here
But No I Didn't Interfere But My Nigga I Didn't Cheer
Say It Wasn't A Good Idea Cause That Coulda Been Our Year
There Is Not An Us Anymore Its Everyone For Me
I Ain't Trippin Ima Lead The People If Thats What Its Gonna Be
If Thats What Its Gonna Be, Realest Nigga I Know Is Me
Ben Franklin Was Runnin To Slow Needent Just Let It Flee
You Can Ask A Nigga Bout Me Theyll Say That Im In The Zone
When The Duo Thing Didn't Do Hot, Shit I Stood On My Own
I Was Bein The Bigger Man While They Shootin Slugs In They Songs
Now Its Obvious That The Fans Can Realize Who Was Wrong
Look In The Eyes Of A Hata Like How Did You Get Your Data
Theres No Such Thing As A Friend In This Business Cause Youre The Playa
They Say Youre In Need Of Prayer I Think That You Need It Playa
So This If All The Haters, Fake Niggas And Perpetrators

(Chamillionaire Chorus)
Rap Game I Used To Love You (Used To Love Ya Baby)
But Now I Dont Love You The Same (Love You The Same)
Baby Im Still Thinking Of You But No Its Not You Its The Change
But Still Im Ridin Like You My Wife
And You Will Always Be In My Life, But You Ain't Right
I Used To Love You But Sumthin Bout You Ain't The Same (It Ain't The Same)

(Bridge)
Comin Up In The Game Jammin That Ugk, Ghetto Boys ??? (But Then It Changed On Me)
Now Everyday Another Screw Dj Tryin To Get In The Game (It Ain't The Same Homie)
What Happened To The Days Of NWA Snoop, Cube And Dre (The Game Done Changed On Me)
2Pac A Biggie Are Both Are Both Passed Awayyy (I Hope They Ain't Lonley)

(Chamillionaire Verse Two)
And Its Crazy Cause You My Baby But Latley You Got Me Deep
In The Beef And The Words That I Right On The Sheet Are In The Streets
You Wait Till They Instigate Then You Gave Me Your Voice To Speak
Never Gave Me A Choice I Keep, My Back On The Wall For Keeps
And The Hatin Didn't Ever Cease But I Took The Real Nigga Route
Seen A Hater And Point Him Out And Did More Then Ignore The Mouth
Did More Then Sit In The House, Did More Then Sit On The Couch
Thats What A Real Nigga Bout And I Bet All My Real Niggas Vouch
Things Come Together But They Split Up Eventually
Can't Argue With Destiny All This Drama Was Met For Me
It Happened The Way It Happened Didn't Happen Intentionally
I Could Hear Em Presentin Me But They Ain't Even ??? Me
The Scripture Was Sent To Me On A Platta But It Didn't Matta
Vision Already Told Me To Distance Myself From Hata
Distance Myself From Cata But Homie I Hear The Chatta
But Im Still Married To The Rap Game And I Won't Let Niggas Have Her

(Chamillionaire Chorus)
Rap Game I Used To Love You (Used To Love Ya Baby)
But Now I Dont Love You The Same (Love You The Same)
Baby Im Still Thinking Of You But No Its Not You Its The Change

I Used To Love You But Sumthin Bout You Ain't The Same (It Ain't The Same)
