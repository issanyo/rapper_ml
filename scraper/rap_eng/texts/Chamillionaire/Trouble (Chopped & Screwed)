(Chamillionaire Chorus)
Roll So Low, But Everywhere I Go
They Say Ohh Noo (Oh No Nigga) Here Comes Trouble
I Roll So Low, But Everywhere I Go
They Say Ohh Noo (Oh No Nigga) Here Comes Trouble

(Chamillionaire Verse)
Is There Nobody To Warn Him, Chamillionaire Will Bomb On Him
Its Cool Your Sticking Up For Him, But If You Want You Can Join Him
Bombin On Him We Swarmin, Then Do It Again While He Mournin
You Can't Diss Me In A Dream And Not Feel Regret In The Mornin
Im Warnin Niggas, Its Gettin Quiet Im That Nigga That'll Stop The Peace
Shoes, You Can Choose To Get Bled With The Soccer Cleats
Or I Can Switch The Kicks That Are Used Yo Knock Out Your Teeth
Drop A Bootleg, On A Nigga Head Like A Prophecy
Chamilli Got The Streets Not Halfway Entirely
All The Hoes In The Streets Are Ridin Me
So The Trash Niggas Talk Dont Bother Me
Yeah, Im Jackin Beats How Do We Deal With All The Piracy
Can't Beat Em Better Join Em Universal Had To Hire Me
Yeah, See I Been An Owner Ain't A Nigga That Can Fire Me
Won't Say Who My Biggest Buyer Be
Cause Snitchin Dont Apply To Me

Niggas Was Talkin Like The Labels Didn't Desire Me
In Texas Hes A Liar Mayne, In New York Hes A Liar B
See The World Tryin To See How I Spit It So Crucial
They Say Chamill Is The Future, Other Niggas In Neutral
May Have Met Drama Before But I Can Reintroduce You
They Say That Chamill Is Coco, The Way I Spit Is Like Vodo
Wadda Ya Mean I Got Ya Team Members Screamin Witch Docta
When A Nigga Gets Choppas, And I Make His Click Pop Ya
The Rap Game Of Late Has Become A Big Opera
But Im Pimpin The Fat Lady, I Decide When It Stops Bruh
Dont Matter Cause Im Badder Then Badder, So Quit The Chatter
Go Back And Just Fix Ya Data, I Rattle Ya Like A Rattle
Splata Ya Into Matter, The Gun'll Make Niggas Scatter
G, Eminem Even Stat'll Get Mada Then Mr. Hata
Texas Down To Atlanta Ain't Nuthin For Us To Get It
As Long As You Know Who Get It, As Long As You Know Who Didn't
You Know The Truth When You Hear It, Dont Ask Who Is It
So Until The Decisions Finished, We Doin It Bigga Business

(Chamillionaire Chorus)
I Roll So Low But Everywhere I Go
They Say Ohh Noo Here Comes Trouble
I Roll So Low But Everywhere I Go
They Say Ohh Noo Here Comes Trouble
