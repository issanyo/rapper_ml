I gotta get out of here, this city’s gonna kill me
Could be anywhere, anywhere but here
I wonder how long before this shit gone take me under

[Verse 1]
Moving through New York City in a black seven fifty
Like Batman moving through Gotham
Dodging pot holes as I gently move
Through Harlem with my wheels on slalom
Pain in my eyes as I'm passing the place
Where they found Sean Bell and they shot him (Queens)
Forty one times, he committed no crime
But I guess life ain't Times Square
But in the city that’s gritty where the bottom lives shitty
And the mayor’s a billionaire
You learn Manhattan keep on making it
And Brooklyn, keep on taking it
Cause life just ain't that fair
For the kids in the park, watching out for the Narcs
Putting Sour Diesel in the air
Tryin' to flip them a pack, stack up a couple racks
And make it the hell outta here… (New York)

[Hook]
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me
I can hear them calling out

[Bridge]
Let the city peel away
There were too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me, out to me!

[Verse 2]
I maneuver through the ATL in a black SL
With the goddess of a black female
This is black male Heaven with the ballers are professing
But to me home feels like Hell
Even though it’s black top from the mayor to the cops
Black blood still gets spilled
They raided a house, no drugs were ever found
But a black grandmother laid killed
Like the dream of the King when the sniper took his life
On the balcony of Lorraine Motel
From now forthward, these young black boys
Seem to self-sabatoge they selves
Or maybe they're just smart, and they choose to go hard
Cause they know the good guy will fail
So you ask what happens to a dream deferred
Langston, well it kills itself... (Atlanta)

[Hook]
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many clouds in this town
I can hear them calling out to me
I can hear them calling out
Anywhere but here

[Verse 3 – Chamillionaire]
You know there’s so many ways in the streets to get money
But it’s plenty more ways you can die
When you get to the sky, tell the Lord I said hi

I rap behind tint through my city, like that H-Town Diddy
Cheesy cake’ll make em walk more than a mile
The paper chase got embedded in our heads
But don’t let it get it twisted, they might kill you with a smile
And you can say it’s a pity in the city where they’re really killin’ us
Prolly the city that’s in style
See we promote that foolish, then they go and rep to it
And we act like we didn’t notice how
You see the young gettin’ younger but they tougher
Chopper tucked behind the buckle ‘til they pull it like pow
Just ‘cause the turf where you steppin’ or the people you was reppin’ with
Just wasn’t who you should’ve been around
Never caught him by his lonely, he got homies with homies
And he think they’ll be the ones to hold him down
Been watchin’ First 48 and actin’ like he can’t relate
You know your friends the first to snitch on you on trial
Sit down
