[Intro: Rasaq]
Yeah, it's Color Changin Click
We in here forever baby
Chamillionaire, It's Rasaq boi

[Hook: Rasaq]
It's color change when we coming and we make it bump
It's color change when we coming cause we raising trunk
It's color change when we coming cause we make it crunk
It's color change when we coming cause we breaking chumps
5th wheel open up my nigga make it jump
Put your hands on your knees baby shake ya rump
Put that money in your pockets nigga make a lump
Break a bottle on his head til it make it bump

[Verse 1: Rasaq]
Your boys in ya squad, I don't bar none of them
I don't care if u rolling with a hundred men
No respect to none of them
I'll bring it to any one of them
And if y'all hull me niggas know I'll come again
You ain't rolling like a real nigga supposed to
I see the fraud in ya soul I'm finna expose you (ho ass nigga)
King of the streets, I'ma dethrone you
All the thugs chose me, the lil girls chose you
You done did it, you bumping but you was timid
You nothing you is a gimmick
I see you I'm coming with it
On 20's and something kit'ed
Lil bumper and windows tinted
You pushing me to the limit
I'm leaving with something dented
I'm jumping in something rented
You suck and you're fucking finished
You bustas ain't fucking with us
I'm crushing your every sentence
All you do is scream your name through your adlibs (who? Dyke Jones)
Nigga we the hardest, yo ass is average
Shit we go harder than some calluses
Don't make me laugh, how yo ass gonna come back from this (You can't)
I'll wreck yo ass like an accident
Iced out the chain to show niggas that we stacking it
Nobody jacking it, come through I'll be packing it
I get a thrill just to see a nigga slapped from it
No love for you niggas I'm unpassionate
When I come to the Swishahouse nigga I'm smashing it
Step in the door, ain't nobody smoking grass in it
All the real niggas left, I wonder what happened kid
Show respect to the boys before you
Without them nigga, it would be no you
Fasho dude you a ho dude

[Bridge: Chamillionaire]
Gimmick ass rappers don't deserve to breathe I know that Texas down to ride for me
Gimmick ass rappers don't deserve to breathe cause Mississippi down to ride for me
Gimmick ass rappers don't deserve to breathe I know that Georgia down to ride for me
Gimmick ass rappers don't deserve to breathe I know Ohio down to ride for me

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Chubby ass, pudgy ass, cover your face with a skully mask
Hatin on ya click dummy ass, Shrek look alike ugly ass
"Koopa what should I do cause Watts really ain't paying me no money" ass
Signed a weak ass contract but you pretend everything sunny ass nigga
Foolishness will stop, tell the public what you got
They seen your DVD so obviously it's not a lot
Hypnotic? 20 dollars in the studio that you lied about
Show money gotta split ya money with T. Farris and Michael Watts
You can't afford to charge less cause then you realize
You wouldn't have nothing left so you can stop the feeding lies
Dike don't want it with us and his yes men don't want it either, guys
He was dissing Magno like he ain't wanna see his people rise
Said he was lazy, he's a loser, wasn't getting cash at all
He was doing shows and he said that Mag was playing basketball
Said they was ready to go but Magno wouldn't answer calls
Found out that was a lie, you don't believe me go and ask him y'all
Where he at? Pissing in his white diaper bag
When I write light ya ass up if ya like Mike ya mad
Tryna make a comeback better wave a white type of flag
Any nigga that listen to him are like Mike a fag
He was whining after the show 6 months ago in Dallas
Tuck ya panties in your a long way from Wonderland, Alice
You don't want no Cham challenge
You don't wanna see Cham mad as he can get
Cause he's legit and he will crush yo damn talent
I sold 40,000 Mixtape Messiah's in one month
At 11 dollars a cd, how much that is?
Here's one hunch, it's too much
Got a Suburban and an Excursion, it's too much
Ninja bike with the rims twirlin, it's too much
My Impala got em hurtin, it's too much
Pussy niggas getting crushed for real
