[Verse 1]
Man, these rappers ain't saying nothing, every verse is a damn lie
Your position is pro-voice, my position is anti
Swear they telling these stories to you, these rappers full of that Manti
Can't stop me, they can try, but I'm winning that by that landslide
Y'all worse than that Titanic, it'll ship, but it won't sell
Y'all posting on snitchagram, while you saying you don't tell
These boys ain't got no stamps, they don't really touch no mail
I'm still trying to get super posted, still fit up under, but oh well
All talking like, "He the man", y'all softer than Peter Pan
So many fish in my fish tank and in my crib, she talking about eating in
Call me up and she'll be to spend, got a money tree then pass me a limb
Pray me, hoping we meet again, but my knuckles probably gonna beat your chin
Hit it off with my plan A, never needed that B route
I ain't even never even shed a tear when anybody ever said peace out
Made it here with my freestyles, they ain't talking about free now
They always told me that money talks, so I always got it on speed dial
Trying to work, and she trying to play, treat the bank just like a hideaway
But I'm showing up, it's like a holiday, but I'm back to work, I'm not trying to stay
A money day is my kind of day, very large is my kind of pay
Tell the vato I am not the best, I bet he will respond to you, "CÃ¡llate"
Wonder why I'm ahead of 'em, talking down then I ended 'em
They tried to say that they're only side, but switch back and forth just like pendelums
Bought this trap and then extended 'em, new cars when they renting 'em
Our old schools look so cool that you probably thought we invented 'em
Steal a heart, but I'm no thief, style snatching is so weak
You ain't gotta thank me for it, just show respect to my OG
Drop enough and you'll OD, veteran, but I'm code B
They keep saying I don't drop, so might drop another in four weeks
Chamillitary go so beast, freestyling on your beats
Gotta take it out of my two hands, and that's the reason it don't leak
Two businesses out of state, no car that's out of date
I've been stunting on them since '98, if you trying to hate then you kind of late
Hit Brazil and take sleeping trips, groupies all on that freaky tip
Say good night and then I take a flight, when I disappear, you can't ya chick
Let me tell you how deep it get, this is more about keeping it
Take a pocket then sleep in it, then I'l put the profit down deep in it
Your girl talking about orgies, rather go and get more cheese
Duplicate how I rep the state, we need less of them and more of me
Spit a verse and it's for a fee, tried to do it but horribly
No trick or treat, my clique is eating, I'm feeling like I'm Chef Boyardee
Said their turn, but their copping, call me up, she said, "Papi"
Knowing that I might score so they trying to block me like we play hockey
Pockets got me like Gretsky, where the hell is my ESPY
I Usain Bolt to that paper, go and, go and tell them come catch me
Don't talk about financials, and tell me what your man do
Unless you got your own dough and you make enough cash to brag too
Hope your rent ain't past due, hope your shape is natural
Can't say you're a model if your last shoot was in your bathroom
Why everybody gotta be the same? Every group gotta be a gang
Every rapper gotta be a rapper and every rapper gotta be a lame
Love my jewelry then that's cool, she gone catch a bad flu
But if my wrist ain't sick enough, then my whip gone make her atchoo
Everything happen for a purpose, obvious they didn't mend your verses
Every verse that'll y'all spitting is worthless, they couldn't pay me to give you a purchase
Every verse they say Cham is ripping, say it's false if they tell you different
I'm still the Jordan, Grant, and the Pippen up, manuscripture don't have me trippin'
