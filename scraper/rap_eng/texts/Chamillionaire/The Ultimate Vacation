[Intro]
Get away, get away, (ay)
You got to have a passport if you rollin' wit me
We can hit Jamaica, or we can chill in France, (yeah)
Roll wit a playa, you can bring a friend, (yeah)
You in the presence of some playas
Chamillitary do it big, (ay)
We can hit Hawaii or the Caribbean, (yeah)
We can do it major, chillin' on the sand

[Hook]
You stressin' every day cause the way that ya livin'
See it in ya face, ain't no fakin' the feelin'
We can get awaaaay and be chillin'
We can get awaaaay and be chillin'
We can go today and get away for a minute
Party every day, do your thing to the rhythm
We can get awaaaay, get away
We can get awaaaay and be chillin'
(Ay) I got money, got paper, (ay)
Got plenty of cheddar, (plenty of cheddar) (ay)
So we treatin' today like we know it ain't lastin' forever, (ay)
Now bartender remember to bring the straw with the umbrella, (please bring the umbrella) (ay)
We just drinkin' and thinkin' of a way that we can make life better

[Verse 1]
Yeeah, coconut with the umbrella baby
And the Rihanna-soundin' chick is the umbrella lady
There ain't no carpet on the floor like they're renovating
Palm trees like my old homeboy, hella shady
Time flies so you know the clock is passin' through, (Whoo)
Hit the sand is the only other task to do, (True)
You know my fan base is international
Their fan base is only within an avenue
(Uhh) Go wherever that ya plan
G5, I show 'em how to fly like Peter Pan, (Whoo)
Get a lobster, anything that you demand
If it isn't then it's something that you will never eat again
Step off the yacht if you wanna see the land
I'll take you to the sun if ya really need a tan
Water look like oxygen anywhere you stand
Cause the ocean is so clear you look down and see the sand

[Hook]
You stressin' every day cause the way that ya livin'
See it in ya face, ain't no fakin' the feelin'
We can get awaaaay and be chillin'
We can get awaaaay and be chillin'
We can go today and get away for a minute
Party every day, do your thing to the rythym
We can get awaaaay, get away
We can get awaaaay and be chillin'

[Verse 2]
(Let's hear it) If money talks, my paper probably speak Greek, (Greek)
I'm in a different continent like each week, (week)
Seein' daylight and they gon probably be asleep
No cell phones in the telegram and East beach
Females is like your chick is so hot to me
Can we all chill? I turn maybe to possibly
You know my beach house is what ya got to see
Paper and property, walkin' game of monopoly, (monopoly)
My helicopter lands on the boardwalk, (walk)
Where the residents ain't understanding your talk, (talk)
The cliff ends and the salt water pours off
Think what you think, but you'll never have a poor thought
Water so warm that the fishes isn't cold
And the air is so open that the pigeons get exposed
Didn't I remind you to bring your swimming clothes?
No, I didn't, on purpose now you're swimmin' in ya "Whoah"

[Hook]
(Ay) I got money, got paper, (ay)
Got plenty of cheddar, (plenty of chedda) (ay)
So we treatin' today like we know it ain't lastin' forever, (ay)
Now bartender remember to bring the straw with the umbrella, (please bring the umbrella) (ay)
We just drinkin' and thinkin' of a way that we can make life better

[Verse 3]
It's all good long as you don't turn on my like a door knob
And ry to make my flow stop like a cork does
And we'll be in Hawaii eatin' corn cob
Pinnin' a flower in your hair like a corsage
Said I shouldn't leave, but you know I didn't hear a thing
10 karat earring blockin' all my hearing
Never go back is exactly what they fearing
Know plenty Jamaicans so I brought you to the real thing
Rude boy, sick with it and I'm dipped in blue
It's like I just appeared here but I really flew
They say it just to rhyme, this is what I really do
Deja Vu, we'll repeat it when the year is through

[Hook]
You stressin' every day cause the way that ya livin'
See it in ya face, ain't no fakin' the feelin'
We can get awaaaay and be chillin'
We can get awaaaay and be chillin'
We can go today and get away for a minute
Party every day, do your thing to the rythym
We can get awaaaay, get away
We can get awaaaay and be chillin'
