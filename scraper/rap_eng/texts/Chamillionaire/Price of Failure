[Chorus:]
Many men wish failure on me
Run from my life until I can't breathe
Tryna be everything that I'm destined to be
And they just tryna take my hype away
Got my mind on my money that's why I can't sleep
Fallin' off is an option I know I can't see
I'm chasin' after G's cause this life ain't cheep
And failure's a terrible price to pay
Many men
Ma-a-a-any, Ma-a-a-any
Wish the worst on me [x4]

Major Pain

I hope your money senior citizen ain't what that statutory
I talk and walk that walk to that infinite path to glory
You met someone that said they knew me and had a story
You mean someone that's in my no mentioning category
I don't give major energy to really minor people
I give them the Major Pain and then I hit them with the sequel
Your weapon isn't equal to my loaded Desert Eagle
Move forward cause limp backwards is equivalent to evil
And I'm no Beanie Sigel but you never was my people
Cause if you was my people then you'd know I'd always beat you
If that's the cost of fame, look like my pockets is receipt full
Cause I didn't pay the cost to see so many turn deceitful
Look what I did, and all of it was fo' scrilla
I turn these young boys to monsters, no thriller
E N E M Y, no foe illa
A hoe, I just fo-fo-fo-foget her
Eyes turning real wide when I'm approachin' her
Weapon in my Chinchila, coat killa
Got a Chinchilla case for towin' my heater
Took a picture of my pistol then I show it to Peter
Ain't walked in my shoes then I don't owe you an Adida'
Matter fact I don't owe the strap on the toe of a beela
I'm a over achiever, I'm a over believer
I will blitz for the chips and then elbow your receiver
Did it once and I see you want me to show I repeat a lot of my past but I'm past done on my owin' you meter

Many men wish failure on me
Run from my life until I can't breathe
Tryna be everything that I'm destined to be
And they just tryna take my hype away
Got my mind on my money that's why I can't sleep
Fallin' off is an option I know I can't see
I'm chasin' after G's cause this life ain't cheep
And failure's a terrible price to pay
Many men

But hell
What is success without failure?
How did I succeed when the teacher said "I'm gon fail ya."
Well, I know I'm gon tell you principal can't expel ya
You call it a bribe but I'd rather call it a helpa'
Uhh
The location is down in Houston
And I'm so sick and tired that business can get confusin'
See your intuition told me to get in an institution
My intuition told me to get me some sick producin'
Spit is sick like pollution
I got the smartest mouth
What is yo college bout
In the world there's a smartness drought
Yeah, I'm a call 'em out, I evolved in a slaughter house
Slaughter your Atacama is the words from Obama's mouth
Feelin' all on your spouse, You live on your momma's couch
They told you that money talks, while your dollars are not announced
Ain't got a lot a ouch
Look at the wall
15's beatin' so hard that my plaques start to fall
Look at former friends, smilin' and plotin' to see me fall
I miss a step and fall and still be 10 flights higher than ya'll
(Hold Up)
Ku Klux Klan to a black man hype
If you got fire they gon' see it and try to take yo life
They ain't take my knife
They can't take my righ(t)-
Ffle, I got it cocked and loaded so just take that snipe
Tired of fools with rules that spell lose
Insubordinate as ever my rules just spell cool
Choose, do what you wanna do
If you wanna cause if you don't do it nobody but you really gonna
In a society where you can choose marijuana
And a women named Stephanie will choose to marry Wanda
And a male won't tell that he would rather pick a brother
Don't want the world to discover his male significant other
Undercover lovers infectin' the industry
And even undercover others that give you the ministry
I know that I ain't perfect I know I'm a sinner G
But I'm hopin' if you listenin' you feelin' my synergy
Amen

Many men
So ma-a-a-any
Wish the worst on me
Wish the worst on me
Till I bring that Major Pain

[Chorus:]
Many men wish failure on me
Run from my life until I can't breathe
Tryna be everything that I'm destined to be
And they just tryna take my hype away
Got my mind on my money that's why I can't sleep
