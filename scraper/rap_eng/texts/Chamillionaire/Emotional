[Hook]
Your man was such a lame, girl, that’s how I got close to you
You know it’s true, you know it’s true
Please don’t say no names girl, just do what you’re supposed to do
Emotional, emotional girl
You know you got a man girl, he don’t even know you
Been with me the whole night, sweating up the whole room
Just do what I say girl, everything will go smooth
And you know that he’ll be home soon

Can’t never let a groupie get too close to you
They always get a little too emotional
Always get a little too emotional, emotional, emotional
You know that you should do it like you’re supposed to do
You know that you should do it like you’re supposed to do
You know that you should do it like you’re supposed to do
You know you do, you know you do

[Verse 1]
Thought last night would be the end of that
Thought you could tap that then relax
What you thought you could just send it back
And never really knew that she would get attached
Nothing wrong with a little bad behavior
As long as you don’t do nothing to agitate you
She just want cake and wanna eat it too
Birthday suit you can have it later
Can’t replace her she’s permanent
At least she is in her own eyes
Besides you never had much success
When you cut her off the last four times
You know it would be so wise
If you didn’t try to tell no lies
Call it lust but she calls it trust
But she popping up, it’s like surprise

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Just stuck in the moment
Laying up in your home and
Time you were supposed to be somewhere else
And I’m realizing who home yet
Got some company on deck
She ain’t trying to condone that
She just trying reach out and touch tonight
She ain’t trying to have phone sex
Got to see you before the club
Feeling like it’s way more than love
You would think that she less than tipsy
But seems to me that she poured enough
Lift it up and then hold it up
Who left lipstick all on that soda cup
She just hope that you noticed love
You know wassup, you know wassup

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Got caught up in that tangled web
Painted dress and them banging legs
Got caught up in that pretty view
And then realize it became a ledge
Real emotions that came with sex
Plus you stay at that same address
You just had a few steamy nights
And your dirty laundry just made a mess
Clean it up you weren’t taught to lose
Pay attention to all the clues
Running through my mind all day
But look at all the mileage she put on your shoes
Wonder where it got all confused
You knew the code but broke all the rules
Awkward moment that quick hit
Type of relationship turned chopped and screwed
You accepted that offer
And trying to say she’s no stalker
A mental clip is full of hollow tips
She go'n make you duck and then dodge her
And you kept dodging them calls, huh
Just when you thought that you lost her
She found you quick than OnStar
Now don’t try to say I ain’t warn ya
