Shit

Chamillionaire:
Come let me tell you, man
Relax, relax. (J. Holiday: From Texas to DC, baby.)

J. Holiday:
It's goin' down
Come here now, J. Holiday
That's the reason I come home, baby

Chamillionaire:
Relax, relax
(J. Holiday: Let's go, whoo!)

How could you be lonely
They don't really know me
Comfortable as ever like my hustle got us cozy

Bottles lookin' rosy
Bags meant to go G
Poppin' tags while we Photoshoppin' like Adobee

Cool as Obama
All the drama was the old me

These walls could talk
They would say how they don't know me

Always on the road
No home could ever hold me

Success is like a drug
And I feel like I'm 'bout to OD

Nah, you don't run around
Actin' like you own me

Wait til I get home
Then you gonna put it on me

Look at how we ballin', bitch
One or two of colby

Look at how they callin'
Voice matters what they owe me

But they just some rookies and you know that you were OG
After o'clock you know exactly where I'm gon' be

You know how the road be
Groupies hoppin' on the sack
But guess who's back to give you the business

J. Holiday:
When I'm in the streets, on ma' grind
You got me, and we gon' shine
Plus I know you gon' go down home, and let me get mine
One more reason to come home
Off the streets
Girl when I come home
Off ma grind
Relax, relax, relax

Chamillionaire:
I got to be in the twelve
Got the Beamer as well

Grindin' like it ain't illegal
And I ain't seein' a jail

On the chase for the paper
I'm on the tip of the tail

I'm the Clyde to your Bonnie
And we ain't leavin' a share

My fat ex-girlfriend, was tryin' to see me get mailed
The UPS in the downs, and you still seem to appear

You ain't breakin' a sweat, put your feet in the air
And while I ride presidential, I'll let you be my Michelle

In this life all these of troubles, I know it's easy to fail
But when it's us against the world, me and you like "oh yeah"

It'll take a lot of hustlin', it's easy to tell
That I am always on the hustle, never seein' a chair

See in my stare, I ain't easy to scare
Put a king with a queen, and they can see we a pair

Soon as I get a full house, it'll be easy to share
All of the royalties and riches, just for keepin' it player

J. Holiday:
When I'm in the streets, on ma' grind
You got me, and we gon' shine
Plus I know you gon' go down home, and let me get mine
One more reason to come home
Off the streets
Girl when I come home
Off ma grind
Relax, relax, relax

Chamillionaire:
We livin' the life, and this is payback
For the days that you used to say that

Maibach, wasn't something that your sights was aimed at
Made that, money stacked up enough to pay that
May stacks, but you told me that I should saved that

Ain't that somethin', we grind to get stacks
As soon as we get stacks, it's harder ta (J. Holiday: relax, relax)

So let your seat back, and let's repeat track
Relaxin' in the sun up, 'n we chill 'til we see the black c'mon

In the streets 'n I'm hustlin' daily (J. Holiday: daily)
You don't need to be stressin' that, baby (J. Holiday: baby)

I get home 'n I know you'll be waitin', yeah (J. Holiday: yeah yeah)
You ain't mad at the money I'm chasin'

And you know that ma lifestyle's crazy
But you always gon' be ma first lady, yeah (J. Holiday: Woo!)

J. Holiday:
When I'm in the streets, on ma' grind
You got me, and we gon' shine
Plus I know you gon' go down home, and let me get mine
One more reason to come home
Off the streets
Girl when I come home
Off ma grind
Relax, relax, relax

Chamillionaire:
Come let me tell you, man

In the streets 'n I'm hustlin' daily
But you always gon' be ma first lady, yeah

(J. Holiday: Yoa got a Texas in the building.)
Oh yeah
(J. Holiday: Chamillionaire, what's up, baby?)
Take it away, Jay

J. Holiday:
Yeah
Just relax
No, no no no no
