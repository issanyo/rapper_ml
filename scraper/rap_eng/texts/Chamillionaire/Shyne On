I'ma show you how to get your shine on
(Shine on)
Turn it up the DJ playing my song
(My song)
Everybody keep on calling my phone
(My phone)
Which one of y'all am I gone take home
(Take home)

I'ma show 'em how to get the club crunk
(Club crunk)
Give 'em something thats goin' rattle that trunk
(That trunk)
Tip ya cups up until ya get drunk
(Get drunk)
Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up

Give me that million dollar beat and let me show you what to do with it
(Who that is??)
That's the illest rapper choppin' and screwin' it
Couldn't snatch the game that's what they told me, so I'm provin' it
Put the truth in Texas with Scott Storch and you got you a hit

Hittin' never miss rep yo click and throw 'em high
Because chamillionaire's the answer to the game like Allen I
Middle fingaz to the sky, if they don't like that reply
'Cause any DJ that deny is a mother fuckin' lie

So give the ladies what that want
Got 'em racin' to the front of the stage
To feel the bass and tell the DJ turn it up
(Turn it up)

Yeah, sound of revenge saying universal to go get my plaque
Rappin's dead so I'ma bring it back, like DJ's do
When they hear my track
Check out my track record, they'll say I'ma track wrecka
Hotter than a black pepper now that I am back nigga
(He's back)

You can't get mad if you feel that you and cap fit ya
Drop the biggest stat's ever so don't let that back hit ya

I'ma show you how to get your shine on
(Shine on)
Turn it up the DJ playing my song
(My song)
Everybody keep on calling my phone
(My phone)
Which one of y'all am I gone take home
(Take home)

I'ma show 'em how to get the club crunk
(Club crunk)
Give 'em something thats goin' rattle that trunk
(That trunk)
Tip ya cups up until ya get drunk
(Get drunk)
Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up

When it's time to hit the club, I let my chain hang
If they got clovers on they neck we in the same gang
I'm 20 deep in V.I.P. puffin' Mary Jane
Splinters still in my hand from my woodgrain

I got homies on the west who like to gangbang
And I got homies on the east who do the same thang
I told Johnny put fifty in my pankyrang
Five karat diamond chain vivas is in it mayne

You know I rep the dirty, dirty where they move cane
You know we mix purple stuff in that blue drank
Hypnotic, big bodies with blue paint
We got that oomp spray but it still stank

You a lame so yo dame playin' mind games
I'ma pimp so I stay in that mind frame
Niggas talk shit until I let that nine bang
Me and duke in that maybach switchin' lanes

I'ma show you how to get your shine on
(Shine on)
Turn it up the DJ playing my song
(My song)
Everybody keep on calling my phone
(My phone)
Which one of y'all am I gone take home
(Take home)

I'ma show 'em how to get the club crunk
(Club crunk)
Give 'em something thats goin' rattle that trunk
(That trunk)
Tip ya cups up until ya get drunk
(Get drunk)
Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up

Headed to the bar
(I'm headed to the bar)
You know I'm V.I.P
(You know I'm viper)

And since you rollin' with a star
(You rollin' with a star
You V.I.P. with me
(Chamillitary hey hey)

Chamillitary the biggest threat
To any of these rapper thinkin' they doin' it
(Who that is??)
That's dem boyz from Texas that always do it big
Multi-colored diamonds got us shining they say our jewelery sick
Houston got a problem and you don't want nuthin' to do wit' it
(Do you kid?)

I ain't think so I'm tippin' slow
Wen my trunk is liftin' up look at the neons as they glow
Groupies never givin' up they be everywhere I go
When that elevator go up to my suite they there fo sho

Told me that she didn't care about my money wasn't hearin' it
Looks can be deceiving as chamillion paint appearances
You know how we do it at home of screw and purple syrup is
She got turned out quicker than my power steering did

I'ma show you how to get your shine on
(Shine on)
Turn it up the DJ playing my song
(My song)
Everybody keep on calling my phone
(My phone)
Which one of y'all am I gone take home
