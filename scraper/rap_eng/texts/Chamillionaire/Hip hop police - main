Go, go, go, go, go, go
Keep runnin' homie
Go, go, go, go, go, go
They on the trail

Go, go, go, go, go, go
Keep runnin' homie
Go, go, go, go, go, go
They on the trail

With so much drama in the industry
Hip hop police are listenin'
Be careful or you'll be history
Looks like another unsolved mystery

It's murda, murda, murda
Ah, it's murda, murda, murda
Yeah, it's murda, murda, murda
Somebody tell â€ em it's murda
Murder was the case and they blamed me

Officer, I didn't do it, you can't blame me for this
Could you please loosen up the handcuffs on my wrists?
You can call me what you wanna mayne, but I ain't a snitch
No cooperation is exactly what you would get

Till I talk to my lawyer, you get no reply
You've obviously been watchin' too much CSI
I'm not a crash dummy so don't even try
To talk your dirty trash to me, no BFI

If you are not guilty of anythin', then why did you run?
â€ Cause you the police and plus I saw you cockin' your gun
And the chamber wasn't empty, it was obviously one
If you think I'm believin' that one, you're obviously dumb, huh

I know that you heard the sirens
You dived into the vehicle, you was drivin' and ridin'
Instead you shouldn't be whinin' about abidin'
By the law, now it's obvious you're lyin'

With so much drama in the industry
Hip hop police are listenin'
Be careful or you'll be history
Looks like another unsolved mystery

It's murda, murda, murda
Ah, it's murda, murda, murda
Yeah, it's murda, murda, murda
Somebody tell â€ em it's murda
Murder was the case and they blamed me

Stop lyin' to me boy, it'd be best you confess
I can smell the BS on the scent of your breath
Saw the meth while I was inspectin' your deck
Saw that you was ridin' dirty when I looked at the rest

Who is this guy Busta? Who is this guy Snoop?
Who is his other friend who's wearing the sky blue?
Look at this pic here, who's standin' beside you?
Tell me his name now, I heard he was Piru

Confiscated the CD's at one of your homes
For evidence ever since we heard some of your songs
What about this Pimp guy, he was on one of your songs
I could've sworn that he said, he had a pocket full of stones

Am I wrong? Hell yeah, I don't know who that is
I don't know no Pimp C, all I know is I'm rich
And I'ma bond like James, bet I be out here quick, man
You ain't gettin' out of here, you must think that your slick

In the car we confiscated The Chronic and The Clipse
Diary that you had and all your blueprints
On the death row booklet, we found your two prints
Your thumb and your index, the judge will love this

With so much drama in the industry
Hip hop police are listenin'
Be careful or you'll be history
Looks like another unsolved mystery

It's murda, murda, murda
(It's a bloody murder)
Ah, it's murda, murda, murda
(It's a bloody murder)
Yeah, it's murda, murda, murda
(It's a bloody murder)
Somebody tell 'em it's murda
Murder was the case and they blamed me

Now you can see you're screwed as the evidence pours in
The witness to the crime was at 3 in the mornin'
Gave us a description so we picked up your boy and
You'll get a lighter sentence if you put the crime on him

A big celebrity, a case we long for
You a pirate, why you got that eyepatch on for?
Funny puttin' people in a hearse what I heard for
Where were you the night of April 21st son? Home

I think that you got your facts wrong, gats on you
Chamillionaire, Rob, Chuck, couple cats on Melview, what?
We gonna have to jail you too
In the line up, don't speak until we tell you to

This the person who jimmied your lock, sir?
Was dark, kinda looked like him, I'm not sure
Failin' to nail â€ cause assailant's another
Believe I see an unmarked tail in the rubber

Hit the Bodega, not no more game
This chick used to be nice, actin' all strange
Like she was gonna get it, pathetic
I sell in court now they all apologetic

With so much drama in the industry
Hip hop police are listenin'
Be careful or you'll be history
Looks like another unsolved mystery

It's murda, murda, murda
Ah, it's murda, murda, murda
Yeah, it's murda, murda, murda
Somebody tell â€ em it's murda
Murder was the case and they blamed me
