[Intro]
A different city every night right
And they be going so insane
I repping for my city right, right
So you should be happy that I came

[Hook]
We believe in, if you see me
I watch the skyline light up every evening
It’s like I’m dreaming baby, what I mean is
Most of y’all don’t know that
This my World, whoooa
This my World, whoooa
This my World, whoooa

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
I don’t worry ’bout paper I passed up
I focus on money my hands touch
If that right there don’t add up
I gotta let you know your math sucks
You don’t ever talk to a calculator
You don’t get caught with an ounce of paper
Every convo is about a favour
Had to get a mansion without the neighbours
I ain't meaning no bad chick
When I say they don’t have a dime
And I ain't meaning no Gold watch when I say “I don’t have the time”
My hustle is the reason I’m known to shine
It’s like I’m in my own World
Cause these boys out here pillow talking
And texting all my old girls
You call that your homegirl
I call that my dome girl
I call that my errr
I’m not home leave a message after the tone girl
I go to places they rap about
But girls only love you cause the cash you got
See all these hoes is chasing stars
Growing up to be cashtronauts
Can’t be mad, I asked for it
Living life in that airport
Y’all ain't even get off the ground
Y’all stuck in that chair-port
I know they wanna see my cash short
But only thing I ask Lord
Is please don’t let me run out of nothing but pages in my passport

[Hook]
We believe in, if you see me
I watch the skyline light up every evening
It’s like I’m dreaming baby, what I mean is
Most of y’all don’t know
This my World, whoooa
This my World, whoooa
This my World, whoooa

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T]
Been through a lot just to get this far
Whip that car, grip that grain
Rev these pipes on the lights
Went from broke, to having things
Catching planes out of state
I got dues to pay, I got moves to make
Folks to feed that depend on me
To keep the lights on, food on their plate
Hit the slab, push it to the max
Expensive taste, I love poppin’ tags
Fucking hoes, I love hittin' the lab
Spittin’ bars that reflect my past
What you know ’bout sold out shows
Promoting country shit everywhere I go
Putting on for the third Coast
'Sippi land, give a damn, what you think of them my folk
If nothing else I gave them hope
If they could follow dreams of their own
Be successful and ride clean with the chrome
If it ain't past leave it alone
Ignore that hate, embrace that love
Most niggas talk down just because
I’m putting my faith in the man above
About my bread, playa be about your’s
Be ’bout chores, stay on course
I make my mark everywhere I go
I spit that trill every time I flow
I get my own, cause it’s all I know
It's all I show so when I toast to the life I live
I’m taking off like a laser beam
Rather not wake up, rather get my cake up
While I’m out here living the dream
This my world!

[Hook]
We believe in, if you see me
I watch the skyline light up every evening
It’s like I’m dreaming baby, what I mean is
Most of y’all don’t know
This my World, whoooa
This my World, whoooa
This my World, whoooa

[Bridge]
A different city in the night life
And they be going so insane
I repping for my city right, right
So you should be happy that I came
She say she want to spend the night right
And I don’t even know her name
(Don't even know your name)
Just sit and watch me as I fly high
Yeah, she wanna be my Lois Lane

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Fresh off the plane, straight to the Rover
I can’t complain, tip for the chauffer
When I hit my room, its over
Floor that I’m on, high as a toca
Funny thing is this girl is sober
But she gon be drunk when she hit the sofa
You stay the night if you acting right
The views that we looking at thats a sight
You really be living that rapper life
It they ain't made it where I’m at than they ain't rapping right
She me and KRIT got dough appetites
You couldn’t see us if with a flashing light
You could die, than come back to life
You still couldn’t see us in the after life
And you know…

[Hook]
We believe in, if you see me
I watch the skyline light up every evening
It’s like I’m dreaming baby, what I mean is
Most of y’all don’t know
This my World, whoooa
This my World, whoooa
This my World, whoooa
(It’s like I’m dreaming, It’s like I’m dreaming)
This my World, whoooa

Dollar to my name, quarter in my jeans
Million dollar vision now I’m living out my dreams
This my World, this my world
I had a dollar to my name, quarter in my jeans
Million dollar vision now I’m living out my dreams
This my World, this my world
This my World, yeah
