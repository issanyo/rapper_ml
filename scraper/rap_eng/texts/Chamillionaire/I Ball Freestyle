[Lil Flip (Chamillionaire) - Talking]
What, Swishahouse, SuckaFree
Kiss a ass if you bootleggin'
(Hold up, Watts, bring that back)
(Chamillionaire, let me and Paul Wall get some of that)

[Chamillionaire]
Look
I'm not the type to brag about the size of my dick
Cuz I would rather brag about the size of my chips
My dimes and my nicks and how I ride with ya sis'
With a diamond in my ear, bout the size of ya fist
Keep ya eyes on my wrist, while I shine and I glist
Don't sip-sip-syrup, I'm buyin the Cris'
I think some of yall niggas, just tryin' to piss me off
Cuz ya girlfriend dying to kiss this baller on the lips
I'm callin' it quits, ain't rappin' no more after this you wish
Get ya mind correct
Chamillionaire wreck a stereo don't even wanna let the tape out the deck
Throw up ya set, and take notes for my lesson
Everywhere I go I hear dumb ass questions
"Do you know Slim Thug, is he really a thug?"
"Is Ron C a DJ or does that nigga sell drugs?"
Get out my face, before I slap out the taste
I'm not really in the mood for catchin' a case
Haters get erased you can ask Ceas-a-Leo
Ya woman wanna be my queen, wanna be my Cleo
Patra I'll slap her, wrap her with a stack of
Big faces go platinum and make em' put my plaque up
Don't bring good luck, I bring niggas damage
Could make niggas panic, when I chop it up in spanish;
No-No problemo', it's all to the bue'no
Not-Not Michael Watts gon' pass me a demo
Keep-Keep it real and keep the Chamillion on ya mind
Spit fire every line, now you can press rewind

(Track Rewinds then ends)
