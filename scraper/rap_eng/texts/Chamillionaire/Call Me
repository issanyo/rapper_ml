She's callin me on my phone
Tellin me, she's feelin freaky
Her body's in need of me
Ya'll know player's get jones
So, if you're feelin freaky and
Your body's in need of me
You can... call me, call me, call me
You can call me
When you're feelin freaky and
Your body's in need of me
You can... call me, call me, call me
You can call me
When you're feelin freaky and
Your body's in need of me

[Skillz]
Her body's feelin freaky
She calls me when she needs me
She can't wait to please me
I don't need you to believe me
I'm not her man or lover
We understand each other
It's somethin bout the cover
We always usin rubber
She loves to go down
I never return the favor
That's why she so down
Creepin so much
You would think we neighbors
She loves to keep it deep inside her
I would say a definite rider
And just because of the player she chose
It doesn't mean I'mma give her the go

[Play]
She won't roll with a player like you
She wanna roll with a player like me
She callin me cuz she's in the need
Of a player like me that's stackin G's
Better bring it back, pull it back
Don't be mad cuz your girl keep callin
23's coop, she's callin me cuz your boy is ballin
I know that she's gotta man
With a game plan, with the weddin plan
But, I'm not the man, we're not holdin hands
But, whatchu have, your man don't understand
She's callin me up when she leaves her job
That's what's up, when she leaves the club
Had too much she wanna cut, that's what's up

[Hook]

[Skillz]
You hear my phone ringing
She callin for a reason
No time for any teasin
This time what friends you bringin
Some say it's a booty call
It might be new to ya'll
Never trick my dawg
Never fuck 'em low
Ya'll already know what player she chose

[Play]
So, I pick her up round quarter to 8
Chop the block and at quarter to 8
Get cha hot cuz I know you can't wait
Pretty face, but I give her her space
So we can do it nice and slow
I mean we can screw it nice and slow
Like Usher, I gotta confession
Call a player when you get this pleasure
