[Intro]
Yeeeeaaaahh
Venom on the way
You already know, it’s yours truly Chamillionaire
I woke up this mornin’ and uhhh...well actually I didn’t wake up cause I really never go to sleep
But uhm, this is what came cross to my mind
I don’t know about you but

[Hook]
My hustle game, Awesome
She say my chain, Awesome
See me in my whip and the ladies say, Awesome
My candy paint, Awesome
And That wood grain, Awesome
Hustle every day I wake up and think, Flossin’
Wake up and think, Flossin’
Wake up and think, Flossin’
See you gotta wake up everyday thinkin’ bout’ how you gonna get to the money
Wake up and think, Flossin’
Wake up and think, Flossin’
I don’t know about you but that’s what I do. Venom on the way

[Verse 1]
Wait until they see the futuristic-ness I’m flossin’ in
I don’t F with Michael, I’m caucasian Air Forcin’ ‘em
Marchin’ in my telly, ladies talk to me like Carson when
She callin’ me daily baby “I just wanna talk to him”
Ya’ll be readin’ rumors ya’ll XXL and sourcin’ ‘em
I’m hollin’ at Obama why he ask if I’m gon’ tour with him
They know you important when your rims is lookin’ porcelain
They didn’t even got ‘em. How I get em? From importin ‘em
Portland, ya’ll already know I’m back to scorchin’ em
It’s a suicide bout to kill em like I’m corpsin’ em
Better dodge ya eyes if you’re tryna beef because of him
Behy dodge ya eye if you ever think of crossin’ em
Homie don’t do it good advice what you should offer him
You don’t wanna be the dummy jumpin’off the porch with him
Say that he gon’ get me then he better bring his boys with him
Your hood can be your home bring it on, and I’m gon’ orphan ‘em!
Why the heck they mad I already earned a fortune and
Your chick is taking pictures pulling polaroids to portrait him
So outta this world, yeah my swagger is in the orbit and
They lookin’ at my neck it’s like he “he brought the jewlry store with him”
That crosses them. Texas boys they brought they candy toys with ‘em
They gon’ earn this that boy Ray face got Slim the boss with him
They'd be in that tone, in that Dallas, in that Austin and
The underground ain’t dead 'cause my hustle game is awesome man

[Hook]
My hustle game, Awesome
She say my chain, Awesome
See me in my whip and the ladies say, Awesome
My candy paint, Awesome
And That wood grain, Awesome
Hustle every day I wake up and think, Flossin’
Wake up and think, Flossin’
Wake up and think, Flossin’
Hold up I’m thinkin’ white make, I’m thinkin’ diamonds so pink lil like you can drink!
Wake up and think, Flossin’
Wake up and think, Flossin’
Hold up I’m thinkin’ takin’ everything in the game including the kitchen sink!

[Verse 2/ Outro]
XXL tried to call it preaching in the streets I motivate
Texas you know what it is, Venom album on the way
You ain’t takin’ me to jail, I ain’t really got more to say
Take my license on the dash and put my pistol on display
