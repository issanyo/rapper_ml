(Chamillionaire talking)
Chamillitary mayne (Fire Drill) Chamillitary mayne (Fire Drill)
You already know who it is Major(Fire Drill) Payne
Cuz I stay bringing the majors pain, (Mo Fire)
Hold up right now class is in session (Mo Fire)
So what we need to do is run a fire drill
Real drill quick y'all know the routine, (Fire Drill)
Stop drop now roll (Fire Drill) stop drop now roll

(Verse)
...Chamillitary boy I run this, Aye

They told me Koopa you da best and then I said I know
It's the Mixtape Messiah Show so here it go part 4
Revenge is a dish that is best served cold
So I walked into the kitchen and made 'em turn off the stove (woo)
How the heck you askin me whether or not I'm the real
I been terrorising y'all before I ever gotta deal (real)
Backyard a little bigger than a soccer field
I been on so many beaches I forgot how socks should feel (ha)
Album coming put the king on ya gift list (yeah)
Rip ya pink slip cuz I'm too sick to be dismissed (yeah)
F what you think I know I'm lyrically gifted
Like a kid that opened up a rap booklet on Christmas
You win and den you lose and they just say that's life
Till you pull out that Ferrari den they say -]that's nice[- Screwed
They say Chamillionaire fell off and I just said that's right
I was standing on my money and fell 15 flights
