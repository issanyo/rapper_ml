[Talking]
(This is your conscience)
What you want man?
(You can't tell em you the best man)
I can tell em whatever I wanna tell em
(Nah you can't tell em that)
How you gon' tell me that?
(That's against the rules man)
I make the rules, look look

[Verse]
Koopa, yeah I used to hoop like hula
I'm a god in the game it's the mixtape Buddha
Flew to Jamaica for some curry cuz I knew the
Residence that was there would say it ain't a kid cooler
Montay sent me the track then I laced it with Luda
Are you a boss of yourself really ain't no approval
Ring looking bluer gave thanks to my jeweler
Cause he the reason these snakes in my face like Medusa
Sue ya, now I will probably bring in a shooter
Put some bank in his bank to keep it gangsta as hoova
My name on the bullet, my bullet in the ruger
Walk into ya nightmares and introduce myself to ya
Like booyah, let em keep my name on your brain
I swang at everything your lane gone be my lane
Mayne, I gotta get change before it rain
My jeans is looking green my change is known to stain
Pain! But there is no 'T' I'm still insane
As Eminem Jay or Wayne I bet you will feel the same
Ashamed, Chamill is the name they gonna blame
For letting the news loose you lames is bout to hang
Strange how you get a name if millies ain't
The only thing in your bank you losers don't really think
Chamilli don't get big bank like Hank
I don't pick up bucks in armored trucks I pick em up in a tank
Bang! Ya already know my diamonds exposed
I never wore Kenneth Cole's I'm ghetto down to the toes
Pockets is like a drive-thru bank that don't ever close
You ever touch any dough my metal gon' hit your nose
Pretend like Unk is your conscience and you should walk it out
Hope that breaking into my vault ain't what you talking bout
Cause I got mo' paper and clips than a new office spot
Used to have one bad chick now I can call alot
This is not a driveway this is what you call a lot
Stay getting guap and just when you think it's gonna stop
You put up the top you be riding with a halter top
I cut off the top all my whips than hit the barber shop
Come to the shop get some rims on your cruiser
I can show you big blades quick as Wolverine or Krueger
I'm the mixtape ruler, Koopa
Ya chick anywhere inside the city I really think that you should move her
Who ya think your talking to you should stop
I show up at woodstock and turn it to hoodstock
Get popped like you got shot with a wood Glock
Be eating splinters for dinner who wanna take woodshop
Underground king I'm who you supposed to pay homage to
Who the heck you talking bout you bout to bring some trauma to
Let me give you fakers a quick clue about what I'mma do
I'mma run upon you with the quickness like Sonic pewwwww
Promise you gonna wake up paler than Madonna do
I'mma wake up and touch the green like a farmer do
Keep your girl away from me or I'm gonna be haunting you
I come after your boo like sandman at the apollo do
Stacks in my jeans a hundredfifty worth of rocks
All these rubberbands and rocks they call me the slingshot
Think hot when you ever see me don't think plot
Think you're sharper than a marker you turn to a ink blodge
Leak out, when I get a buck I'm bout to nut
No homo I do it solo my wallet turned to a slut
Trick what? I never get stuck I get it up
She say she wanting a cut this trigger bout to get cut
Garages like ours got camera's on each seat
Alarms is like bombs stay further than three feet
I went and bought three cars I call em a threepeat
I went and bought three mo' and I call it a repeat
Defeat, is what they gon' get when I arrive
You better open your eyes, I bet you gon' get surprised
So let me spell it out for those saying I'm telling lies
My initials is FU I'm the best rapper alive
