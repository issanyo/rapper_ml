[Hook]
Stay chasing payments
Hard times done changed in
I can’t be slaving now
Ain’t do this overnight
I know you’re thinking
This life is really amazing
Ain’t do this overnight
Look at all the non-sense I’ve been through
So called beef with you know who
Did it myself why don’t you
Why don’t you
Ain’t do this overnight
Don’t expect help when it all fall through
Everyone will tell you it’s all on you
Fight or run what you gonna do
What you gonna
Ain’t do this overnight

[Verse 1]
Everybody saying that they want the life
But everybody thinking that it’s overnight
They say you want to win but you know the price
Ain’t do this overnight
Have a little chick that was known to gripe
Early in the morn I was on the flight
I don’t really know if it was wrong or right
But I Ain’t do this overnight
Always did it big way before the hype
I’m just trying to live let me roll the dice
Gotta be the boss can I own my life?
Ain’t do this overnight
But you wanna tell me that she’s for sure my type
My jewelry looking like I just went on a heist
Garage full of SUV’s and motorbikes
See I always realized that it was more to life
Now I’m back to this I’m on rapping trips
Classy chicks that wanna have a kiss
When I was walking in the mailbox etcetera
With the stacking chips that share packet jets
Had a bucket list to get a platinum wrist
Have platinum shift and get a platinum disc
Was a level I ain’t even have to hit
You isn’t there you ain’t even done half of this
And now they tellin me they really want the old school back
But where was you at when the old school act
Got exposed to crack for the local rats who were laughing
When they saw the tires go to flat
Tell my enemies that I was born to win
I bet you never go against the boy again
You a historian go check the facts
I ain’t going back, keep your DeLorean

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Lost a label then made a label
My partner tried to be Cain and Abel
Y’all see what sipping that Haterade do
Ain’t do this overnight
They tried to say, you let money change you
I wasn’t never no perfect angel
But you lazy acting like you disabled
Ain’t do this overnight
This decision is proving fatal
Time you spent away might decay you
I see myself in that XXL and Source magazine on that coffee table
9 to 5, till that job betray you
Playing your moves until day delay you
Most of record companies hate to pay you
But your lawyer gotta get paid to save you
I work the feet I don’t work for free
There’s no limit you would think purchase me
What works for them just don’t work for me
So don’t purchase one just go purchase three
Now they say the game is in surgery
They need a doctor so they insert for me
I put on the gloves and insert the needle
Hope I’m executing this perfectly
Now I’m feeling like it’s back to the basics
Feel like I’mma make it out the matrix
Don’t believe me just watch
Can't see it then you better get LASEK
Make this money but I never let the money make me
Hey money, tell me what you done for me lately
See me and you ain’t even cut from the same tree
Same cloth, I’m a boss, let 'em see in HD
