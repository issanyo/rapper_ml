[Hook: Corbett]
As you should know
There’s nothing you can do
There’s nothing you can say to me
To make me change the way I am
And I know
That I'm close to the truth
And I won’t let you take from me
You’ll never change the way I am
Cause I know

[Verse 1: M.i]
I know this game that I been talking bout
It ain’t the same as always
Ain’t no rain around me pouring
I spit this pain out I'd endorse it
And this fame ain’t the same as when I played it
I’m saying so
So it’s only fair that I get focused
Save it, I push this dope
And I been done with all that, fuck if all that old shit get me stuck
Get em’ up if you’ve had enough and you ain’t budging its nothing
This something for all my brothers
In a rut trying to get that number
For the girl out there who’s hung up on her past but she still run up on that come up
And the bills late but we in this bitch and we still straight
I know you really wanna say it feel fake
But it ain’t so I gotta kill hate
And I'm broke but who gives a fuck
I woke up and I know
That I hold it on my shoulders
I ain’t going nowhere I'm posted
And I hope if you got a better plan, go ahead and let me in on it
I'm so sick
I be damned if the better half of me folded
So I won’t quit
Gotta couple mo' letters I need to let em get noticed
So I kick that potent that shit that-that

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Aye, tell me what you do dream
And I'll tell you what the true mean-
Ning of everything that you seek
Cause everything that shines ain’t true bling
See you can sport a few rings
And go import a new team
You can sell your soul but that isn’t gold
And now your rings are turning you green (uh)
You can come up on a big advance
Lucifer probably your biggest fan
Did a whole lot just to get a grand
Turned down a whole lot for a million
Did it then and I’ll do it again
See, you was trying to get laid
Always told you bands make her dance and she trying to dance on your grave
Dance to make her hold up sho' nuff
I got the glow
Hate the truth?
Then I promise you that I'm the type of person you hate to know
They wanna take control, take ya soul, make a bowl and have Cheerios
Not at the top but I'm really close
I destroy em all with my fury flows
Haruken
All you can do is play
Start hooping
Try to tell you they play fair but it seems to me that they all juicing
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who the clowns in this carnival?
Wait, gotta go, I just gotta call
But aye, you should know that its probably y’all

[Verse 3: M.i]
I know it feels like we losing
But its cool cause we got this movement
As soon as we drop this music
Its nothing you can do to it
So tune in, "m to into
I'm to intuitive proven over and over again
I’m a shoe-in but I get back to it (aye)
Better get used to it
This that shit that help you get through it
If you sitting in that cell
If you sifting through those excuses
Be simple, lets get into it
Don’t let it get to you
Foolish to think that you get immune to this life that we been in, stupid
I know but all we can do is get through it
Try to move and pursue it
Try to make due with this
Use it to get a new resolution
If you confused then I'm moving to soon
I'm soon to be ruined
If I keep at it like this then I'll get that boot
So I'm pulling for you
And who woulda knew
We’d get to choose what we do
Not with what’s given to us
But what we do with it, truth
I spit that cool in this booth
With Koopa, Corbett we moving
That youth influenced, that pull em in with this
