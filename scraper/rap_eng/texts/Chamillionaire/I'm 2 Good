(*"hey" repeated in the background throughout the entire song*)

[Intro - Chamillionaire - talking]
Hold up
You know I gotta hit 'em with the wittiness, huh?
That's that old Koopa, that's that throwback
Know what I'm talkin 'bout?
Uh, DJ Rapid Ric
I'm a do this real smooth, one take, I promise
Hahaha, know what I'm talkin 'bout?
Chamillitary in the house
Let's get with it, uh

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Let's get busy, I'm so witty
Take a spin in my Bentley girl, let's get dizzy
Told Johnny "Make Da Band", wrist blessed like Diddy
Got that old money baby let's get drizzy
Money too grown, so I chase them Young Bucks
I'm not from Cashville but I get the funds up
I'm pickin up all my money in a rented dump truck
Swangin in somethin hard and off the chain like nunchucks
Little boys actin like they bars the same
I'm too sharp with the punches, I carve the brain
So sick with the spit, they get nauseous mayne
Every time I leave the booth, I see a carpet stain
I'm the Northside Answer, H-Town Chancellor
Leo, Sagittarius, Scorpio or Cancer
Yes I'm "The Boss" like Tony Danza to Samantha
Don't mess around and make me make you an example
In Ohio, the chicks that I know
Tell me that my flow must came out The Bible
No reason to lie for, each word to die for
Sidekicks can stand back, one set is my show
My flow you know that's the bet
Change your mind and bring cash if that's a check
Set trends 'til the end with rap I'm blessed
Before the Koopa's there's a King, that's respect

[Hook - Chamillionaire]
On my money, on my hood
I'm too fly, I'm too good
Touch my cash, wish you could
On that grind, I'm too good

I'm too good, I'm too good
At hustlin like you wish you could
I'm too good, I'm too good
At hustlin like you wish you could
