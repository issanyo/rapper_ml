Let's get 'em Happy
Go!

[Hook]
Y'all ain't about nothing
Y'all ain't about nothing
Y'all frontin, y'all frontin, y'all frontin, y'all frontin
Y'all niggas just hate, Y'all niggas just hate
Y'all fake, Y'all fake, Y'all fake, Y'all fake
You ain't finna do nothing, you ain't finna do nothing
Y'all frontin, y'all frontin, y'all frontin, y'all frontin
Introducing to you now is the kid they love to hate
But when you saying what you saying
You just say it to my face

[Verse 1]
Yeah you see him? (Yeah)
You see him bow beat him down lean him down (lean him)
Your breathing sound like you now layin down sleepin
You be surrounded or found on the ground bleadin'
You see him how he look now and he ain't found a reason
My reason is that they won't have to persuade
Me to have the courage to walk right up and say it to your face
A faker never know he fake
A hater never admit he hate
By the time they figure it out is probably gon be too late (yeah)
Grinning up your face is like you tryin to let me know
That you ain't really happy how how I'm getting all this dough
Let the truth be told tell me is your friend a foe
Better make it clear or get mistaken for a ho (Yeah)
And then you take him to the floor
I can't ignore it if you're talking
But I hope that what you talking ain't about running up or robbing
Walk around like everybody is the enemy just for precaution (just for precaution)
I get no surprise and have to see an early coffin

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And what you smokin'. your brain clouded yet the pine got your mind polluted
You got some smarts in your mind hey it's time use it
Your friends arrive talkin down on the loud music
Them niggas's lying plus them concept is gettin included
How could they tell you, you was built to last
You built like a boxing bag, put a whoopin on that ass
See us approachin that set in motion in that hour glass
Rome wasn't built that fast, find your exit and dash
Lookin for crabs in a bucket tryin criticize me (me)
But they do it around them niggas don't say it around me (me)
And if they do us opposite how they feel about me (me)
Turn my back and they relax and talk that lip behind me
I see you a busta and I'mma bust ya in your lip
Put some lipstick in my fist, throwin you a kiss
Since I see that you a sucker, suck a gasoline dick
Put it right up to your lip, put a lighter to the tip (boom!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Where you from? (Where you from?)
Act like you know I'm from the south
We ain't playin, what you sayin?
I can't hear you when you talk
What you want? (What you want?)
What you sayin out your mouth?
We ain't playin, what you sayin?
I can't hear you when you talk
Where you from? (Where you from?)
Act like you know I'm from the south
We ain't playin, what you sayin?
I can't hear you when you talk
What you want? (What you want?)
What you sayin out your mouth?
We ain't playin, what you sayin?
I can't hear you when you talk
