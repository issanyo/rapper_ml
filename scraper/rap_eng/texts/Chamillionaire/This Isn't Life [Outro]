I feel like this isn't life, this isn't life
If this the way it's gon' happen then I'm quitting rapping tonight
I feel like this isn't life, I feel like this isn't life
I show no love 'cause it's usually like I'm kissing a knife
I feel like this isn't life, nah this isn't life
After that H.A.W.K. and then Moe and then Pimp, no this isn't right
Lord forbid that I die
But the decision ain't mine, I'mma look to the sky
Like we just visiting right, I know that this isn't life
