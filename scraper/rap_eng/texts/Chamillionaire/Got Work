[Hook x2: Bun B/ Chingo Bling sample]
Got purp got pills got pills got purp
Got purp got pills got pills got purp
I-I-I got a pocket full of purp and that gush in my blunt
Yeah I'm riding down the block with that work in my trunk

[Bun B:]
Well it's the king of the Trill
Got the crown on my dome
With that super criss connect supply the town on my arm
So if you looking for that big fat sac of that lavender
Every hour of the day, everyday on the calendar
Hit me up I can hammer ya, ya orders I can take em
Got a sweet tooth for cake and pies well I make em
I mix em up shake it till they come back flaky
No I won't stop the hustle, can't nann nigga make me
Leave ya heart achy breaky when I come through with that girl
And that boy like Hannah Montana "Best of Both Worlds"
You see the mother of purl on the Rolex pressey
Don't make me pull out the shapo with two tone bessy
Bun B I'm representing P.A
With the homie bird bigger low coming up of the Bay
So let a hater say whatever's on his mind
He ain't stopping a dime with me, he's burning on his grind

[Hook x2: Bun B/ Chingo Bling sample]
Got purp got pills got pills got purp
Got purp got pills got pills got purp
I-I-I got a pocket full of purp and that gush in my blunt
Yeah I'm riding down the block with that work in my trunk

[talking: Chamillionaire]
