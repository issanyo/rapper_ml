[Intro]
Wake up America! It's morning
And morning is amazing
It's when we charge into the future
When we blasted off for the moon
Scaled the highest peak
And flew for the very first time
Morning starts, and changes everything
It's a clean slate, a fresh start
So come dreamers, and trailblazers
Champions, come builders
It's morning, wake up, and be amazing
