Koopa, ain't no lyin' or fiction up in me please
I don't exaturate the price it was 15 G's
When they ask about the color diamonds in DP's
Yeah I'm one of the richest niggas in these streets
I'm a candy flipper
You can have a picture
While i pose like a playa you can have ya candy wit ya
Koopa never have no time for penny pinchas
My nigga how come you ain't take it to Miami wit ya?
There's a couple haters that won't let me be
I feel like yellin' at the radio like spc
The movie room in my crib got an empty seat
I'm wit Sway gettin interviewed by MTV
Yeah i'm ill at rappin
But i'm still not captain
Ain't took the damn drug
And he still ain't trappin'

I don't change no sleep 'cause Chamill ain't nappin'
Stop actin' like platinum when it can't happen
I'm a north side rider, ain't got to worry
'cause a major deal is not about to turn me
And the controversy ain't about to hurt me
I don't play no games like I forgot my jersey
Still ride around the city wit none of my niggas wit me
Still ride for H-Town if don't none of these niggas feel me
Ya ain't gotta like me, I have none of these niggas hear me
I'm a be the MVP if don't none of these niggas pick me
Alot of rumors in the street
Ain't none of it really pretty
Gettin' all this money makes all the drama seem itty-bitty
Pick a click
I don't hang none of these niggas really
But I'm glad 'cause the matrix runnin' up in the city 'cause.....
