Call The Coach And Tell Em Bench His Ass
Nope I Ain't Havin That, Quit Surroundin My Habitat

(Kiotti Verse Two)
Everytime Im Fixin To Chill A Hater Pop Up Im Feelin ill

Its Like Touching A Strippers Tits They Not Feelin Real
God I Hope You Will Forgive Cause This The Nigga Im Fixin To Kill
Why He Won't Mind His Bis? I Knew I Wasn't Offenden Him

Plus They Know Me Better Than Actin Like We The Best Of Freinds
No Peace For A Houston Texan
So I Tote Heat Im Used To Plexin

I Can Only Warn You One Time The Next I Think You Gotta Learn This Lesson
Nothing In This World Can Protect Him
No Seat Belt Can Help When I Wreck Him (G-Yeah)
