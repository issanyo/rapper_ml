Uhh looks like another win for me
Its the ultimate victory

Everybody get low it's a stickup everybody get low (everybody get low)
Everybody get low it's a stickup everybody get low (everybody get low)
Everybody get low its a stickup everybody get low (everybody get low)
Everybody get low its a stickup everybody get low (Chamillitary mayne)
How come

Everywhere that I go (Everywhere I go)
They look at me like a criminal
But im a CEO, im a CEO( I'm a self employeed CEO)
I'm not a criminal

Let them stay local while im about to hit japan
The G4 get me out when I get in a jam
You gotta go internatonal to get with cham
Women on your phone I bet you switchin up yo plan
Let them other rappers beef while they arguein
Will be runnin in with the bags to get the all the grams
Take it out yo hands (take it out yo hands)
Money talks, only language that I understand
I heard that puff n jay were worth over 300 mill
That means that this year I gotta put it in 300 gear
You wanna treadmill homie
You just runnin still
Yes this is the rap that all the other rappers love to feel
I got the plaque but now im back for the reload
We know while imma still stick to the street code
Tell me what the industry is lookin at me for
Cuz here ya sold platinum they didn't think it would be gold
Now they try to tell me that there will never be mo'
But these flows sure to be a ***** to yo ego
Ya im from the south they try to tell me that we slow
But its ironic that your tryin to keep up with me tho

Everywhere that I go (Everywhere I go)
They look at me like a criminal
But im a CEO, im a CEO( I'm a self employeed CEO)
I already got dough, I already got dough (but I think its time for me to get mo')
I'm a CEO, im a CEO (I'm a self employeed CEO)
I'm not a criminal

Call up Universal n tell them open up the vault
N tell them I just had another million dollar thought
Albums do not sell they tell me we not in a drought
How bought I run in these labels for the **** n break em off
Imma boss yeah yeah
My money is unlimited
Sorta like my motorola minutes is
Koopa bout to tell you what the business is
Rap with this rapper major label on I gettin rich
Whatcha mean the label didn't promote
I put a million on a million do it till I go broke
Might have to run for president so give me yo vote
'Cause Bin Laden wouldn't be the only one in the scope
Get a rope 'n' duck tape theres bout to be a crime
Simplify yo songs I ain't simplifyin mine
The industry done got in the streets thats why rappers diein'
Dont get it confused imma still show you how to grind
They tell me if I write a lullaby for the females
That these sales are sure to skyrocket in retail
Hope you got a backup plan if yo cd fails
I'll drown em like seashells
Till they hit these shells

Everywhere that I go (Everywhere I go)
They look at me like a criminal
But im a CEO, im a CEO( I'm a self employeed CEO)
I already got dough, I already got dough (but I think its time for me to get mo')
I'm a CEO, im a CEO (I'm a self employeed CEO)
I'm not a criminal

Everybody get low it's a stickup everybody get low (everybody get low)
Everybody get low its a stickup everybody get low (Chamillitary mayne)
How come

Ultimate Victory
I'm back for the reload
But we know imma still stick to the street code
Look at sumtin pretty in the middle of the road
Bouncin on rims like a brick at a free throw
I told em tomorrow imma be on BET
Look at all the free clothin that they came n gave to me
I told em tomorrow imma be on MTV
Look at all the jewelry my jeweler gave to me fo free
I'm winnin so keep the hatin to a minimal
Y'all need to give applause to the general
I'm hearin how ya'll talk in yo interviews
Y'all really all just be talkin like a interlude
Poppin at the mouth
While im poppin tags
50 thousand in my pocket pants gotta sag
Magazine critics always talkin like they bad
But in the streets tryna hide behind a pen n pad
But its ok
I know why you gettin mad
I gotta lot of whatever yu neva had
Got a betta pad
Got a betta slab
We gonna keep it movin try ya best to get a cab
Remember you wer jammin master p
Now that houstons super how you try n ask for me
They be askin for a verse dont even ask the fee
Tellin me how many bars to spit like thats for free(EHHH)
Try again
Sorry betta luck next time
Unless imma sleep the only time is lets grind
Yall need to stop like the words on the red sign
Unless im pointin sumtin tellin ya get down

Everybody get low it's a stickup everybody get low (everybody get low)
Everybody get low it's a stickup everybody get low (everybody get low)
Everybody get low its a stickup everybody get low (everybody get low)
Everybody get low its a stickup everybody get low (Chamillitary mayne)
