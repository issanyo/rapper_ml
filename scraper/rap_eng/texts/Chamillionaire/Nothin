Chamillionaire - Talking:
Uh-Oh, here come them WaterBoyz
It's the Mixtape Messiah
It's Koopa

Somebody feel a breeze in here, who left the windows open?
Vapors coming from my grill look like ya kinfolks smoking
Haters be singin' that song, "My Neck, My Back"
When they get smacked with the gat and be flat as a door mat
Internet thugs we pissed but since you wanna diss
I'ma take a pic of my dick and save it on a disc
The file name is 'Suck This' and You've-You've got E-mail
You ever diss one realest...va'to in retail
I'll extinguish ya english while grabbin' my penis
And spray it all in ya face like R.Kelly do teen-kids
Car so foreign the plates say 'Me Don't Speak English'
My money got pregnant so does that mean that my ring is
A princess, I pimp yes, car got raised
Tryed to count the rim inches it took me 2 days
I bet the car you'll never catch me listenin' to B2K
But I bet in the car if a jacker catch me, gon' be 2 K's
Off safety don't make me, show you my aim
I don't know if she still in school, but I know she got brain
From playin' on my ding-a-ling, but it sounds like a mumble
'Cause she's got a mini Mutombo on top of her tongue bro'
Yeah I can pimp the pen, but San Antonio
Know I can come off the head like pullin' a phony 'fro
Ya metal-metal it's Chamilli-Yun-Air
Niggas is scared I knock a niggas chin in the air
And you know this, maan
