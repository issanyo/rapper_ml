[Chamillionaire]
I'm like Floyd Mayweather
I flow better, my dough better
Fast or slow, whatever you want to do let's go
You already know I go hard
I am the mixtape circuit god
Flow like a butterfly, sting like a nah
A bee don't sting as hard as C
You won't live after you get stung by me
No pay-per-view though, you can get that for free
Chamillionaire dot com, Don King
Get in the ring, ding, ding
I'm ready to go, eight rounds, nine rounds
Matter of fact, we gon' knock 'em out first round
We gon' knock 'em out first round

Never heard another rapper bragging this much
That's because I get it hater, shut the F up
No one on the corner got a swagger this tough
I'm the only around that's getting money like Puff
Grabbing my nuts while they turn my mic up
Losers on the net tryna tell me I suck
Couldn't name a rapper that I couldn't light up
And I realised I just had another light bulb
Bright idea just like my ear
Maybe I should diss a mother-F to get press
Maybe I should tell Canada I go harder
Than all other artists and I am the best
Yes, I am Texas, I am freshest
Got to come down, got to come down
And when it come to spitting the fast or slow rhyme
I'm Jay and JazO and Twista combined
City I rule, ain't getting at you
Because me verse you isn't really a duel

I pity the fool that try to get in my jewels
Tell security to move and just give me my tool
I'm after your honey like I'm Winnie the Pooh
I'm telling her to strip down and get in my pool
She thinking is that what she really should do
And now she taking off her shirt and she telling me cool
Got all the paper, I ball my paper
And throw it down the toilet like it's toilet paper
Ain't my birthday but they knowing I'm caked up
Forget a super head homie, y'all can take her
I'm throwed in the game, you know I'm insane
With no curse words like the old Lil Wayne
I'm better than Michael, yep better than Jordan
Matter of fact I'm the Kobe Bryant of recording
You ain't important, I am the man
Do it all again homie, that's the plan
And if it don't work then I'ma get it demand
I got a clause in my contract that say that I can
Mixtape god of the mixtape art
Benchwarmers better play they mixtape part
You a retard, get played hard
Go against me and that's a mistake boy
Paparazzi still tryna take my photo
Got a drop top when I hop in my photo
I be by myself cause these boys act homo
And I don't mess with y'all, yep I still roll solo
If you disrespect me then I'm not respect you
If you don't respect me then I'm yelling F you
I treat you like a stepchild you don't wanna step to
The mixtape god so I'm yelling bless you
