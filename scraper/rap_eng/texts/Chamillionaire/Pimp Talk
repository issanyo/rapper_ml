We goin lose everything we taught to get mayn
Don't'chu see that the game is set the - to go somewhere else if we don't strength up?
At the end of these records we listen to, we don't get nothing out of em no more mayn
We don't get no social commentary
We ain't getting no kind of knowledge I.D. records
Errbody be talkin bout how many chains they got on, and how much dope they sold
But the truth of the matter is I don't believe you!
Yeah
Independent as ever
Texas was at the top
Destiny try'na to stop us
Expecting Texas to flop
So we pull out the drops
Let the trunk on and pop
Reminisce how we lost almost every legend we got
C.E.O. of myself just like Jay is to Rap-A-Lot
Facing the Geto Boys will always be big as Pac
Jay is my favorite rapper and Roca-Fella was hot
But we goin tho up the H for we ever tho up the Roc
Family chasing a dollar
Chad he got a daughter
Legecy with a momma
Plus he got a Shanara
Hawk he had a wife so I picked up the phone to called her
God goin handle that and the blessing will be to calm her
Who would of known that after the arugments we would ball?
Got into it with Paul
Started it that's my dawg
Divide it is how we stand
United is how we fall
Pimp knocked down the door and then told me we had it wrong
Errbody don't need records life
Everybody lying, everybody busy? d-boy?
Everybody be hard core gangstas
Everybody goin do this to each other when they see each other
And the truth be told, we too blessed and we having to much money in this rap game and we goin to war with each other
Don't nobody wanna fight nobody in this rap game
Cause ninety-eight percent of these dudes is
Yeah
When the landlord was try'na say I was locked out
Hustler, that ain't nothing that I'm a cry bout
Used to sit up in the crib, romming noodles with lights out
Now my crib presidential and it's large as the Whitehouse
Yeah, maybe I'm getting older, maybe into a voter
Daily I'm living sober no mix and drink in my soda
This reality show ain't a promising as they told'cha
Texas got the controller so maybe it isn't over
You a man the morals the industry can't destroy you
Y'all be up on that gossiping ish and I jsut avoid you
Y'all be acting like possem when see em I coming for you
Y'all really don't want problems with me cause I will destroy you
(Oh these boys hating!)
