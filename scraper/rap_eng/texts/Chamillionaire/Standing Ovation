[Intro]
What's up man? I seen you got a Grammy and everything
You done change you ain't, you can't even call me back
You don't even call me back bruh
I called you, 75 times yesterday dawg
They cut my phone off, cause I was calling you

[Singing]
Now that I got dough in my pockets
And a whole lot of profits seems like everybody loves me

[Chamillionaire]
It feels great, seems like e'rybody loves me
Round of applause for the cause, thank you, and thank you
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Used to treat me like the bad guy from Houston and the media was like Darth Vader
People turning like turntables, they crossing over like cross-faders
Try to switch up teams like ballplayers, so our enemies are like our neighbors
Keep 'em close, yeah very close, most of 'em folks are still loaning papers
You can work or you can have the work or we making more than all of y'all wagers
Motivation makes hustlers make it so we successful cause y'all made us
Used to not give a flying 'F' when they greeted us with that one finger
Whole world jumped on the tip when we hit the switch and sat on swangers
Hit the hood they say y'all famous, grinding hard so we can ball later
They be like "Damn, that boy made it" - if they say I didn't that's wrong data
First a broad will try to say I'm fraud
See me pull that wad and that guard changes
Calling me she wanna be on the team and now she mad cause I'm ignoring pages
Boys thinking that they concern me, y'all actin like y'all waiters
Same ones that used to walk past when we was underground but now we all majors
Keep speaking begging for a beat and I'll tell the streets to do that boy a favor
Turning purple, blue and red, all flavors; I got a message for all haters

[Hook]
Made it to the top and it ain't no way to stop it
And I sho' ain't forgot when everybody used to judge me
Now that I got dough in my pockets
And a whole lot of profits seems like everybody loves me
I know you like my style, I know you like my style
I know you love the way I put it down
I made it through the hating
So when you see me shining give me a standing ovation

[Verse 2]
I was bouncin back like ping-pong, "Ridin" became the new theme song
Beatin on my chest like I'm King Kong when I broke the record for the ringtones
You ever seen a platinum plaque that look like that then you seen wrong
Better sit back and relax cause my platinum reign is gonna seem long
And I don't blame boys for hating
Cause they was impatient and they didn't know the plan
I knew that something had to shake and it was gonna bubble like a Coca-Cola can
And I shook it up like a soda can, my wallet is overflowin man
Now my potential's unlimited like the minutes of my Motorola plan
Accountants and lawyers that got big business managers
Chamillitary is an enterprise, is you ready to ride? Is you a fan or what?
SoundScan'in' in Africa, SoundScan'in in Canada
We don't play, yeah VMA's, it can't get any better, can it huh?
And I know it's hard to stay humble, they really thought I threw a fumble
I could'a caught that through the trees, I run it right into the jungle
Could'a been lil' Mugsy B., try;na back into Mutombo
Would'a still been a victory for me, you win then they'll say they love you

[Hook 2]
I know you like my style, I know you like my style
I know you love the way I put it down
I made it through the hating
So when you see me shining give me a standing ovation

[Verse 3]
Let's give 'em cheers to everyone who thought I'd disappear
Thought that every word I said was a subliminal shot to disappear
Now I'm in a different gear, no beef, no hate, no dissin here
You must;a been drunk to doubt me, you obviously didn't miss a beer
I used to argue 'bout everythang with folks that just didn't hear
You realize I was wasting words like whispering in a missing ear
I'd say it good and real, they telling me it isn't clear
My two eyes just didn't tear, cause weakness is what I didn't fear
It's a better result than last time but this grind it's a different year
I really should be commended for what I've accomplished, give a cheer

[Bridge]
Nah matter fact I take that back (wonderful!)
Hold your applause for the sequel
We haven't gotten to the part where they try to cheat you (wicked)
Haha, yeah...(Whoo! Chamillitary, you're a genius, you're a genius)

[Hook]

[Outro]
Wonderful!
Wicked... whoo!
Chamillitary, you're a genius!
