You know a rapper, don't even introduce me
I know you think I’m a rapper the title don’t really suit me
I’d love to be called a rapper, but rappers are really groupies
And groupies wanna be rappers, call me a rapper loosely
Wouldn’t wanna be in a similar category
Of anyone with a story for Jerry Springer or Maury
Story’s a made up story, your story don’t add up for me
We in a world where publicity stunting is mandatory
Either you’re Super Dave or a stupid slave
Or acting a stupid slave cause you trying to be super paid
Listened to all your tunes, what is this auto-tune?
If this was the NBA then you all woulda got a broom
Woulda swept ya right out the series for copying other plays
It worked for the other team, so you trying to throw up a trey
I would empty the bench and replace all you clowns any day
Who told you you could be Jesus Shuttleworth anyway?
Think ya balling you Bynum, look at ya Andrew
You tried to play all ya cards, look what ya hand drew
Is it the love or the money, why you in the game fool?
You can ball but the money won’t buy you an angle
A loss I'mma hand you cause of the stupidness men do
But see there’s an amount of stupidness that I can handle
You should give an example. Everyone's an example
Pure as a virgin until they get ran through

If ya hoping to see me miss
Hoping to see me fail, hope that you get ya wish
Those sleeping on me, should be sleeping on this
Help you to make ya bed, help you to dig a ditch
Those who never ever did anything on my list
They can say what they want, they don’t even exist
Hope that you keep my name off the tip of your bottom lip
You can jump off a cliff, hope your parachute doesn’t fit
Even some I respect would lose it all for a check
And then not even get the check; reason to get upset
I ain’t getting emotional, I'm just not being sociable
Even though that’s what Nancy my publicist say I’m supposed to do
Excuse me cause I don’t wanna do the interview
They see through and I’m the one that got the inner view
"But Koopa how can you talk because we ain’t been hearing you?"
You know it always gets hotter after the winter's through
They say you're a genius
I say you're a Beavis, no pledging allegiance
They’ll say you’re the meanest, but they don’t even mean it
You know that they really gon' ride a wave of convenient
I’m glad that everybody learned how to surf
But I’m shark under that water that’s emerging to murk
Fresh, like I’m allergic to dirt
So when I kill em all I’ll try not to get blood on my shirt
Every verse is a keeper, ain’t a price for a feature
I just do it to do it, my pockets don’t really need ya
If dissing is your procedure, promise you I’ll delete ya
Trying to stay in my lane but you mention me and it’s ether

Yeah, I’ll set up your corpse
You can go pick the artist, I’ll wet up the charts
Never said I was perfect, I’m not better than y’all
But if we talking about rapping, than not better is false
If money talks what is your conversation
Cause you show me you got a real lack of communication
And rappers, I appreciate inspiration
As long as they don’t confuse inspiration for imitation
The thought or the implication of that would be blasphemous
Snatch the words out the mouth of whoever vocab it is
If that rapping is rap I’m unwrapping they packages
Then I repackage it up just to show ya what rapping is
Competition, we should start a petition
For every person that’s still in a major label position
Obvious that you idiots never paid for tuition
You switched up the definition you calling that a musician?
Listen I’m on a mission, so you just get in the car
Voices all in my ear say "try not to get involved"
Didn’t give me the option but I'mma get rid of ya
The ill mind of Koopa is telling me "kill 'em all"
