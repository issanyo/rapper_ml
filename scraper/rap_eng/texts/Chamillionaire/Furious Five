[Hook: Chamillionaire]
Cause I'm lyrically so dangerous, yeaa
You don't want no problems, you don't want no problems
Ya'll know I'm so dangerous. mmmm
You don't want no problems, you don't want no problems

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Death by lyrical injection
I kill you rappers
A lot of green with a yellow complexion
Women call me the Green Bay packer
I pack the zero's
Meaning mucho deniro
So paid, rappers is waiting on trades and they all get Knicked like Melo
Hello, LUDA!
Tell theses other boys double up
Cause I got some work all on my waist but I call it a tummy tuck
My every records jumping, or playing double dutch
I shit on rappers every verse just got the bubble guts

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Haha, hold up
Ludacris they are Ludacris think I'm new to this
Rep the dirty all across the world I polluted it
Suafist and a hollow point through ya head
Hope ya get the point it don't really matter who you is
Nowadays they be snitching and they so smooth
Defaquit your vocals like it's pro tools
Sposed to keep it real but they don't you
Know you get the blame when the police is who he spoke to
Diabolical shoot at your and turn your molecules
Into particals how you really thinkin I'm a lose
Comical money only reason I'm a move
They'll anounce that I made a killin like obama news
3 stories but the truth really never told
3 stories in the condo I never know
Who I goota kill to get a bomm docks episode
With shakira shaking what she got in a leapered robe
Play no games like I never got a token
My money counter just be going through the motions
Give me my Jim Carrey mask cause I'm smokin'
Always bein a boss what the hell is a promotion
Anything less than the best is insulting
Gold toilets, I be pissing like a sultan
I hope ya got geicko I leave ya broken
I'm taking bout the mic I see the lizard and I show him

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
I went from eating top ramen to being top rhymer
Check full of commas
No regrets except for the drama
I remember a time when my only perfection was my momma
My mind in the wrong direction
Now it's time ya bow down in [?]
Writ in my honour cause bitch I'm bonker, plural
In a whip with my Ivanka, pompous [?] girl
She on E, feeling on me, singing on key
While I'm bumping We Are The World
Got a sniff from Britney, no he didn't did he
"We run this town"
No he didn't did he
I feel like tinting the glass
You take a sip with me
She from the city of Jackson
I call her Mississippi, that was pretty witty
Demand like a black man tryna get re-elected
He ain't get it, did he?

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
Stick it to the pedal
Pedal to the floor
Just whippin' it through the ghetto
Metal in the door, case I gotta throw some lead into ya, boy
Referee mind state, I'm settling the score
I don't know what ya'll hating for
Wait, wait, know what, matter fact
I don't know what you're waiting for
I ain't finna say nothing, turn the bass up more til the speakers pop
I get a kick outta that, like a sneakers spot
See I was a little kid with his thumbs in his ears
And his tongue in his ear going na-na-na-nah-naaar
Just when you think it stop na-na-na-nah-naaar
Everything I speak is hot
But bont be mad at least everything you speak is...
I can't think of nothing nice to say, you're not nice okay

[Verse 5: Crooked I]
Rapper, hustler, entrepreneur
My shit fly like I'm launching manure
Lord of the underground, God of the sewer
On Hennessy Black, on Con-to-the-jure
Yeah I'm off the block
This ain't work, homie I'm off the clock
I'm a syllable Hannibal killer
A cannibal with a mechanical mandible to deliver the flammable
Ammo, lyrical animal off the top
Rep that West till I walk with Pac
We the 2.0 Boys, Tiz, Crook and Joe, Royce
New Ghost Rolls Royce pulled off the lot
Pop me the only way you could stop me
I'm top seed, I clock green at mach speed
So watch me if you haven't seen a phenomenon
Spit fast as Lamborghini's and Ramadan

[Hook]
