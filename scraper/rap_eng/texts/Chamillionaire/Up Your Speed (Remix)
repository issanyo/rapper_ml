Everybody always tell me that they love me man
Tryna get the money in my rubberbands
So I hold anotha weapon in my other hand
Cause sometime my weapon never wanna jam
I'm a driver yea, your a passenger
If it's record sales I'm international
I'm in united kingdom even africa
I got the billboard looking like a massacre
They passin ya, the ladies love me damn
If they be Sway then take that his way
See the watch and chains like a soccer game
See how I ball and all ask to kick it
The bottom is the spot where we don't stay
You wanna race to the top with me no way
They be like he know Sway, they be like he don't play
I keep a bag full of chips the frito lay
It's the return of the Sway, you ain't heard of the Sway
Your profile views I could earn in a day
I put up perform then I'm burning away
Make rappers look small like ferba away
I maybe in the game like fatman scoop
Plus I got a flow tighter than the batman suit
Ain't gotta brick spit this shit it's slick
So the ladies will always try ta earn to stay
From the morning I wanted to be a millionaire
Never thought it would be me and chamillionaire
Never run up in yo city like mayors
Where yo chick somethin silly like layers (ya scared)
Wanna up your speed beats bangin in the truck
5000 db's my numba give a
The otha emcee's will try ta keep up with the jones's
Well we keep the jones's up
You better up your speed, up your g's
Up your euro's, my custome breeze
Cousin what you mean
Up your bling hunned thoused dollar watch up your sleeve
Ya better believe so pump your brakes
I keep the thing that interrupt yo face
I'm a put you in a trunk pump mo bass
Through the speakers so I can interrupt yo face
England scotland up your speed, ireland wales up your speed
Houston austin up your speed, dallas aswell change gear
You wanna make your cities up your speed
All around the world up your speeds
Please d d d d d don't kill anybody
I'm makin anotha fittin to the league I'm down
I'm deep underground, I'm feet underground
Got a 2nd lp comin out I'm a king who sir
Come from all the peeps come around
In the benzka round the benz
Myspace but I'm up thousands of friends
The next time you drop they'll be down in the thames
Now that's the sound of revenge
I'm a lord an the rappers tryna hurry up
Going nowhere fast coause your times already up
I took the vroom and ya got blown away
My only choice was to blow you guys ya really suck
Gettin paid and I put the hate into fact
Stack stack stack stack it up
The jokers got me laughing all the way to the bank
And they so slow they couldn't even catch a cold
Uh
We finna roll right through
They rap so they say I wanna blow like you (wanna blow like who)
Blow like you watch ya'll move slow through the door like screw
I don't make enough then I don't have to party
I'm winnin the race the whole class applaude me
They say money talks so my cash is talkin
Gotta love me now but I'm mad in charge
Car I'm starting is an aston martin
I'm pullin my green out like I'm at a garden
Throw it in the crowd they all yellin loud
See the traffic jam that my cash is starting
In the evening and in the morning
Gotta grind all time yea that's important
But when I talk the whole globe will listen
Cause they know my visions way past recordin
