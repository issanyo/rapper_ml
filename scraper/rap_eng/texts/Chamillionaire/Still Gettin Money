Let's get it

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Ben Franklin, that's gon' be my mascot
Cause for the dead presidents, I'll pull the mask out (*gun cocked*)
Countin plenty dough, look how good my math got
Never hoop a bad shot because I shoot with that pop (*gunshot*)
While y'all was watchin Kobe jumpin over a car
I was in a G4 jumpin over a mall
Get a telescope, cause I know I'm a star
All my millions got me feelin like I'm a over the law
Hold too much dough for me to throw in a palm
It'll take a day to count it, I'm a show ya tomorrow
Rollin with a weapon like I know that it's war
Get blitzed for your chips and you'll be holdin your jaw
Last time I took a loss but now I'm ready to win
Competition doesn't listen, you can never defend
Vince Carter how a baller always bendin the rim
Then I go and purchase more so I can bend 'em again
Chain lookin stolen, ain't embezzled a gem
So I gotta hold that iron like I've been in the gym
I ain't goin back to record labels ever again
My account would probably have to get to negative ten
Naw, I don't mess with Jordan, I'll leave that one to Nelly
But I got plenty cake like the Snackwells, Little Debbie
Want that +California Love+ like that Mak and a veli
So in a California club, I'm a pass it to Felli
Told Famous you'll be famous hit me back on your celly
We can go hit Vegas up and blow a stack when you're ready
Always knew I had that glow like all the rappers in "Belly"
They call me Prince Hakeem cause now I'm back with the semi
(*gunshots*), uh
