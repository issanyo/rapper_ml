[Intro - Chamillionaire - talking]
I got a question
But really it's not even a question, cause I'm already the answer
Like cigarettes bein linked to cancer
I don't even got to ask ya
I'm the mixtape master and I'm linked to disaster! (disaster, disaster, woo!)
I put product in the streets and soon you open up that package
You know it's lookin at you like
Umm, I know you're lovin what you see
Who do it big as me? (hey!)
Not a nan-nother (hey!)
You know what? Bring in my ad libs (heeey!, you in the presence of the finest)

[Hook - Chamillionaire]
Look how my Chevy be
Popped up on 23's
Open up the roof and let it breathe
I know you're lovin what you see
I'm about to let my seat
Back, while I let my beat
Up, and let them haters stare at me
I know you're lovin what you see
They say they keep it street
But they ain't real as me
And I still can see the jealousy
I know you're lovin what you see

Won't do it big as me baby
Won't do it big as me baby
Won't do it big as me (oh my goodness)
I know you're lovin what you see

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
I could make a quick exit from this rap ish, but I prefer to ball
Everytime I spit, they think Michael Vick, (huh, what ya mean?), murder dog
So much money in my account, that my money count is like "yeah, right"
My bank teller in disbelief, she look at me and turn pale white
More to life than chains with ice (and) dollar bills (and) 28's
Took a loss, but I'm a boss, I got the cost to make sure they straight
Cause I feelin just like Pimp C "cause these boys sweeter than some honey bees"
But I'm takin flights and still bzzzt, still buzzin like a honey bee

[Break - Chamillionaire - talking]
Yep, still buzzin, bzzzt
Still buzzin
Lost count how many mixtapes I've put out (Koopa!)

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
I could cut my fans off and act like I ain't heard of y'all
But everytime I spit it's like the magazine (huh, what ya mean?), murder dog
In the streets (yeah), I'm The Source (yeah), every verse is like intercourse
Vibrate (huh?), why wait (uh), climax when she hear my voice
Walked in, saw the crib, it was mine about an hour later
All good, I'm still hood, eatin Church's Chicken on a marble table
So much, horsepower in my garage, it's like a stable
This Benz (uh), this Benz (yeah), they twins like Cain and Abel
They like "it's you again" (huh?), cause I'm such a hooligan
I got some neighbors, but I don't be gettin cool with them (cool with them)
I stay Disturbing tha Peace, like I'm one of Luda's friends
Don't knock on my door, cause you know you gon' probably lose a limb (lose a limb)
Northside forever, Koopa still gettin dough (dough)
Groupies at my show, my sex appeal is my flow (flow)
Got the 'furri sittin low (low) and the AC gon' blow like snow (snow)
It's Mixtape Messiah 4, you know I'm trill to the toe, whoa!

(Pimp C: Trill, know what I'm talkin about?)

[Break - Chamillionaire - talking]
Huh huh, I love doin that man
Major Pain! (Hey!)
