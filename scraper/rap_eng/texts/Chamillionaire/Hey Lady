[Big Gem]
I see you watching mami, you keep on passing by me
I see you sticking out your ass, showing off your body
I see who's hand you holding, he brought you to my show and
Wink at me one more time, and I'ma snatch you from him
I ain't fucking around, I'm only in your town
I don't know, for about three more hours
So let the bottles pop, Crystal...naw
Henny on the rocks now, you know how I do it brah
We buy the bars out, thugged out blinged out
Every chickenhead, know what we be about
Now here she come again, but without a friend
I told you I would snatch you up, listen to what I said

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Gem]
What you wanna do, head to the room
Or you wanna chill, with a playa like me
Got the limo outside, we running out of time
Come on shorty, take a ride with me
I got ya where I want ya, you where you wanna be
You say your man's a square, and he can't give you what you need
I put a thousand on it, you a stone cold freak
You ain't an Aquarius, your ass ain't no Aries
A dime piece Pisces, maybe
You're a gorgeous Taurus, I don't know come closer girl
See I'm a Gemini, both sides to your right
Compatible, offer the best with the freaky type
So let the sparks fly, bring more liquor out
Or you a Scorpio, your ass finna get dug out
See I ain't playing with ya, Big Gem gon give it to ya
It's what you waiting on, Koopa talk to 'em now

[Chamillionaire]
