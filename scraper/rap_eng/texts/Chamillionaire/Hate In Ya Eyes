[Intro: Chamillionaire]
Jealousy in ya eyes (That's what it is boy)
Envy in ya eyes (That's what it is boy)
The label that's on the rise
Tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
You can love me or hate me
But I'm still gonna get my money
Envy and jealousy is all I see
(Yeah) I can see the hate in ya eyes
You can try but you can't stop me (That's what it is boy)
I keep it real, I keep it street
So tell everybody that don't like me (Chamilitairy Mayne)
That I can see the hate in ya eyes

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
If you the best, beef is somethin' you should expect
Cause the rest will break their neck to be as good as the best
It's obvious I'm the best, so I'm lookin' for less
Of the friends that just pretend I'm only lookin' for checks
Say hello to the villain, I would say it's nice to meet you
But It's not, so I don't pretend it is when I greet you
The same niggas that run with you, try to beat you
So I chase money like the payment that's on ya lease due
Gimmie that (that)
Gimmie gimmie that (that)
Yeah, that is why the wallet fatter than a city rat
Feelin that, 'till it's really really fat
You hungry and tryin to eat and niggas tryin' to get ya snacks
We ain't havin' that, you feelin' me? Yeah
You hit 'm with drama, they ain't prepared and I'm feelin' they scared
So go tell 'em I said Imm'a make a killin' this year
Headed all the way to the top, like there ain't a ceilin' in here
(I keep goin' baby)

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
You can love me or hate me
But I'm still gonna get my money
Envy and jealousy is all I see
(Yeah) I can see the hate in ya eyes
You can try but you can't stop me
I keep it real, I keep it street
So tell everybody that don't like me
That I can see the hate in ya eyes

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
You ain't really like the after taste
So I'm back to put the music business back in place
Let's get back tryin' to crack crack crack the safe
My moneys like my liquor somethin' I don't have to waste
But I do, keep somethin' hot attached to the waist
And Imma keep some ammunition up and that's a waste
They thought I'd fall apart like the Micheal Jackson face
But I come in like "gimmie that" and snatch the steaks
Can't see the truth in your face you must be blind
Deaf too
Representin Texas, Imm'a rep it 'till the death too
They say I'm sick, when I spit they sayin' achoo
Cause this type of cold is the cold they wanna catch too
But there's a catch too (too) because you can't win
Haters hatin', we respond (Let em get mad then)
We headin' straight to the bank, we 'bout to cash in
I'm in the driver's seat if your ridin' then get ass in

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
You can love me or hate me
But I'm still gonna get my money
Envy and jealousy is all I see
(Yeah) I can see the hate in ya eyes
You can try but you can't stop me
I keep it real, I keep it street
So tell everybody that don't like me
That I can see the hate in ya eyes

Jealousy, jealousy, I can see you're jealous of me
But keep hatin' me
I see the hate in ya eyes, but it won't stop me
Let 'em hate

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
And pay attention to the screen
They ain't shinin', it's clean
They could see it as soon as they see me, ain't assumin' a thing
Jewelery that you say is mean is PG-13
My wrist like a horror flick, it make the white girl scream
I gotta tell 'em to calm down, the pinky ring's a preview
I put another set around my neck to be the sequel
They told me that money's the root and turns people evil
So I get checks, you upset soon as they leave you
Could be true, that you feel what I'm doin' is wrong
But it's better to be pissed off than pissed on
It's better to stack big wads, then get coins
So I chase money myself and won't let you join

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
You can love me or hate me
But I'm still gonna get my money
Envy and jealousy is all I see
(Yeah) I can see the hate in ya eyes
You can try but you can't stop me
I keep it real, I keep it street
So tell everybody that don't like me
That I can see the hate in ya eyes
