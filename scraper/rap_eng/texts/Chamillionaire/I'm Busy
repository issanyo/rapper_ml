[Hook]
I know you're trying to see me, but I'm kinda busy
She telling me, she like my song (she said she like my song)
She said she got nothing on, but heels and a striped thong
Girl I think it's time to bone (girl I think it's time to bone)
Bring the Screwed up c.d., cause this time is easy
To stop hiding behind your phone (stop hiding behind your phone)
That's what lil' mama told me, so you already know
That a playa bout to bone (that a playa bout to bone)

[Chamillionaire]
Got a girl in Dallas, she love Pappadeaux's
She be calling me up, Koopa let's eat
Sorry, but I got a radio interview to do
I gotta hook up with Milla Mack, and Greg Street
Maybe we can retreat, to get a bite to eat
Take a night to sneak, to a tightless suite
You can invite some freaks, but get it right I'm cheap
I won't pay you could leave, with tonight's receipt
I'm in Alabama, or Louisiana
Ke'Noe and Dolby, BeBe and Jabber
When I'm not in the lab, you know I'm trying to grab a
Couple G's chick please, what are you getting mad for
I'm in Atlanta in the morning
When I hook up with Killer Mike, Lil' Jon and them
All of my calls, I'm gonna forward them
To the answer machine, please call again I'm busy

[Hook - 2x]
Sorry you didn't reach me, just the answer machine
Sorry I'm not by the phone (I'm not by the phone)
But you know that I'm gone, call you when I get home
Leave a message after the tone (leave a message after the tone)
