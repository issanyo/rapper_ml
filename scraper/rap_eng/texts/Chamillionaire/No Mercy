[Hook]
No mercy, no mercy
We no have no mercy
No mercy, no mercy
Nope,I don’t have no mercy
No mercy for this industry
Niggas, you heard me
No mercy, no mercy (let’s do it)
I don’t have no mercy

[Marcus Manchild]
[Verse 1] Okay, I need no introduction
I could hop on this and say nothin’
But as soon as they press that button
It’s like somebody just brought my lunch
And yes, I’m hungry, fillin’ my stomach
Till I vomit, I take that dump up
In this bitch give life abundance
With my shit, no way Montgomery
They like ‘here, go again’ on another nigga track
And you know we ‘bout to kill it
I’m like ‘we run the biz’ any nigga rap
When you get around them and they feel this
Like they sittin’ on top
Home boy, you know you ain’t hear shit
You worked up here and pinned the part
I’m swimming with some big fish
Listen, this how it is, friend
In the club I pulled his bitch
Now he mad about the women
When I pulled up and she in this flip
Told ‘er put her phone up and her purse can’t take no Twit(ter) pics
But she up on my log, like a frog bitch, ribbid
Endless this swag here, nigga
I'mma do this till I finish
But the first thing that I know is don’t mix business with no friendships
Now, since we got that out the way ask me ‘is it worth it?’
No, he not cause im the lord, space god, no mercy

[Hook]
No mercy, no mercy
We no have no mercy
No mercy, no mercy
Nope, I don’t have no mercy
No mercy for this industry
Niggas, you heard me
No mercy, no mercy
I don’t have no mercy

[Marcus Manchild]
[Verse 2]
No mercy, no mercy
Turn it up, make sure they heard me
Ever since they heard goin fast on the track
Now the niggas say they part of the derby
I learn these, niggas be really jockin’ how I’m working
Since you niggas on my dick, like a piston
Suck me slow, just like a slurpy
Undeserving, of what I’ve been burned so I gotta burp these
Babies, just they made me, now they shaking like the twirk team
Got me goin’ crazy, out of space, I’m not an earthling
But they here bumping they lips just like a bitch who carry herpes
Nasty, I’m with it, I promise
And everybody know that I’m the coldest
So when the preacher is talkin’, please shut up
You niggas just speak just to be focused
And you thought I get my shinin’ dough
Think a nigga blew it. No!
I’m the Texas chainsaw
Word to Thomas Hewitt, bro
And I had em nervous ever since I service
And you goin’ against the god
Really ain’t smart, no it ain’t worth it
Just be part of a congregation
Be quiet, I’m having church please
Tryna mess up my sermon and the Lord will have no mercy

[Hook]No mercy, no mercy
We no have no mercy
No mercy, no mercy
Nope, I don’t have no mercy
No mercy for this industry
Niggas, you heard me
No mercy, no mercy
I don’t have no mercy

[Chamillionaire]
Man, these rappers ain’t really G’s
Soundin' sweeter than pretty please
You ain’t never been horizontal
Don’t talk to me about overseas
Every flight that I’m stayin’ on
I’m layin’ on, I’m gettin’ Z’s
Your money talk is just child’s play
Like your chaperone and that Chuck E Cheese
Everybody wanna claim the belt
Never wanna go toe to toe
Don’t even remember y’all
They introduce you like so and so
Put all the rappers on a totem pole
Everyone that you know is low
They could jump with both of their hands up
They couldn’t reach the hairs on my scrotum, ho
Your pockets heavy like sumo
Your enemies gon sue mo’
All your dogs that didn’t ever bark is gonna switch it up and be cuJoe
I’m just watchin’ my hew’s glow
Illuminatin’ my hublow
You got hands out like gimmie 5
Till I snatch it from you, like ‘too slow’
If I had a dollar for every girl that’s gonna sweat of pleasure, that’s major pay
My whole staff would get a raise and my maid probly would need a maid
I ain’t never been a Captain Save ‘er
I ain’t never gonna save the day
How you say that you independent then swap saliva with Flava Flave?
Come on, let me know that you need a doe
Hope the marble on these floors get make the joints and yo knees so
They tell me that it’s time to go
She tell me she ready to G O
They tell us that it’s time to go
We get on the jets like T-Bo
I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout getting’ grands
Equity, I got bigger plans
Stand on Jimmy that means desperate
I’m rollin’ dice with business hand
They Like koopa, what is you gon do?
Do my best to not give a damn
Take a pic of my big dick and put a filter on it, instint-cham
Now hold that
All in front of your own stacks
When the camera get turned up you give your homie that loan back
Look to most of y’all side ways
Confident but you know you’re whack
How you claim that you worldwide when your pack is lookin’ like a Culdesac?
I noticed that, I can’t pretend
There ain’t a ever fake in the room
I know your album is comin’ soon
But why you have to act like cocoon
Even if you make noise now
There’s no evidence that you’ll get to June
Matter fact you might fall now
There’s no evidence that you’ll get to noon

No mercy, no mercy
If you think what type think whateva
Heard me? Heard me?
It will never happen like Baby signin’ Percy
It will never happen like kobe in New Jersey
I couldn’t even see him in a New Jersey
Every time that you think of me
It come to mind, should be playa-made
I see your girl, she give me knowledge
I won’t stop till I say her grade
Only time that you’ll see a G is that plastic wrap on your Gatorade
You ain’t even much see in me
Your vacate is my day to day
She just fall back, fade away, MJ
The game’s full of more characters
Than costumes, at Comicon
Stay eat, I like Papa John’s
Stay see in air all is gone
They over here with this take out
Well y’all ain’t eat, I’m like ‘drama done’
No mercy
