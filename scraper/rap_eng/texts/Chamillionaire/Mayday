[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
My name is Krizz Kaliko
I'm totally alone here
Well, maybe just one of few left
If anybody's out there, anybody -- please, help!

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
This music game here is in a state of emergency
All about currency, wackness reoccurring with urgency
Can't take it any more
Maybe I'm getting too old, mouth piece just too cold
It's getting me swole
I need to occupy hip-hop like it's my concubine
But I'm the nigga so that mean I gotta be the bigger one
Tell Rittz to pull the trigger all them niggas is done
If I miss then all the hits you can name under the sun
It's a trick and how they doing this, music is done
Tell man don't mic me up
Tell the weed people light me up
Your CD don't hype me up
YouTube fans like me up
You too loose man, tighten up
I don't need to be a Freshman, I'm fresh, no yes men
Rap 'til I can't breathe let me catch my breath and
Industry needs Epinephrine
Pastor what you see better get the reverend
Rapping overseas but I rap Midwestern
Krizz the bee's knees so I guess the best in
Me I gets deeper than your depth perception
MCs believe in me and there's no question
This is my S.O.S. to you and also FU too
And I won't step to you again
And I'mma hold my breath for you to stop these checks
Comin' to these train wrecks of many men
Try to save it try to stay connected resurrected
Never expecting me to win
One of hip-hop's last few legends
I'm holding a grudge until the end

[Hook]
Hollering "Mayday!"
Anybody can you hear me?
Yeah, me
Why do they mistreat us, save us
Aimless bastards leave us, shameless
By the time we're rich and famous
All our art will be forsaken
While you're waiting sides are taken
Nonsense they just keep on makin'
While our last breath we are takin'
We don't want our heartbeats just to stop - stop - stop

[Verse 2: Rittz]
They love me on the internet
But they don't wanna see me on no magazine cover
Half of these wack rappers never see struggle
I've been fighting all my life and never let my knees buckle
Now I finally made it everybody wanna seem stuck up
Me suck up to the industry suckas
Please fuck ‘em I can barely afford to eat supper
Now you telling me the work that I put in and all the years we hustled
Makin' music now somebody wanna eat a piece of it
Fuck you and your snap back and your wack rap
You suck, you suck, he sucks too
They rap he’s wack; She raps? Freeze — That’s killing me, but your an MC, what’s new?
Just shoot me
You should go to college
You could join the army
You could be a barber
You can be anything you wanna be but not a rap artist
Your lyrics ain't cutting it, you suck as a performer
Sorry to inform ya
What you mad and wanna battle me you gonna need some armor
I try to keep it calm but, every time I log on to WorldStar I see a bunch of shit
I know is gonna piss me off more
The comments are worse than the rappers are
Fans say that you're the best, spectacular
The next minute they talking about how wack you are
It's no wonder why I always wanna smack someone
I need a magic wand, abracadabra gone, your shit is past beyond bad
It's trash it's scum you need to practice some
I hear you rap and yawn
That bullshit I heard you spit will never have its run
Bullshit music fucked this game up
You should be embarrassed you should be ashamed of
Ever trying to rap I think it's time to change up
Rittz and Krizz Kaliko, adios

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Here we go now
Horror flick, you should start with the sequel
Peephole, what I saw to deceive you
I’m the doctor that walks in and greets you
And serve you a smile like I’m all for the people
Meanwhile I’m the wrong one to speak to
To hell with a bark or my dogs will delete you
The bars are illegal and all this is lethal
It’s Conrad Murray when he walk in and greet you
I sharpen the needles, let it rewind
Badder flow, that’ll mess up your mind
Got a Kaliko, got a Tech and a N9ne
And more weapons then everyone on this record combined
And that’s strange
Cause I seem so nice, I seen your wife
No better yet, I seen her twice
She needed flights, I got ‘em when I seen the price
And let her roll with me like she had some green to dice
I know it’s been a while since I sold a platinum too
A million and a million-and-a-half of you
You tell me I’m the rapper you was rappin’ to
I have you lookin’ like a mummy when they wrappin’ you
Don't be up with my face when I'm asking you
You better leave space like a NASA crew
I didn’t have dollars, now I have a few
And now they look at my garage and tell me that’s a zoo
Is that a Jaguar?
Of course it is, I purchased it because the corpse’ll fit
And this trunk is bigger than the Porsche’s is
They say I changed, well I call it metamorphosis
Fast lane, get the hell up outta my lane
Your brain will never be as quick as my brain
Advil will only cure you for a time frame
But I got a bullet that’ll get rid of your migraine

[Hook]
