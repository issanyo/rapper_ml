[Hook: Chamillionaire]
Slow loud and bangin’
I turn my speakers up
And then I just start swanging
Sometimes I get behind the wheel
Then I start to steer
Don’t know where
I’m going but just get me out of here (ah yea)
Slow loud and bangin’
I feel the breeze and it be feelin so amazing
See baby I’m just trying to live
And I got stress for real
So I drop the
Top because how it make me feel (ah yea)

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Drop the top and then you know the drill
Hit the strips so I can show the wheels
People say that I’m over trill
But when they talk about me they promotin' still
They told me real ah recognize the real
But if you real then you should know Chamille
If you don’t then you should get a coat
Because a cold shoulder is the coldest feel
What I’m reppin' written on my plates
This type of weapon isn’t on my waist
But I can see you ain’t got a clue
So be a good detective and get on the case
You can sit on that couch at home
And not reach success and then call it fate
‘Cause y’all the type that applies the brakes
But know that I’m the type that ain’t trying to wait (i’m)

Slow loud and bangin’
I turn my speakers up
And then I just start swanging
Sometimes I get behind the wheel
Then I start to steer
Don’t know where I’m going but just get me out of here (ah yea)
Slow loud and bangin’
I feel the breeze and it be feelin so amazing
See baby I’m just trying to live
And I got stress for real
So I drop the top because of how it make me feel (ah Yea)

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Money don’t make you bullet proof from stress
Get sued mess around and lose your vest
Get your heart broken and bruise your chest
Peace won’t guarantee the rookie’s rest
You're a good girl trying to find who to sex
While you trying to figure what dude is next
Someday you gotta get bad news depressed
But even winners gotta find new success
Meditate ain’t a spare to wait
Next stop on the map is a better day
Pretend that the clouds wasn’t never grey
Put the past’s in the past and just let it chay
The passengers side where your head ah lay
While I’m on the route to the getaway
The truth ain’t what you should be scared to say
So when I turn the beat up and I let it play it say

[Hook]
Slow loud and bangin’
I turn my speakers up
And then I just start swanging
Sometimes I get behind the wheel
Then I start to steer
Don’t know where I’m going but just get me out of here
Slow loud and bangin’
I feel the breeze and it be feelin' so amazing
See baby I’m just trying to live
And I got stress for real
So I drop the top because of how make me feel

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Seem like this world so chopped and screwed
Good parents don’t give proper dues
What the hell happened to Dr. Seuss
And who taught these little kids how to cock and shoot
Turn 13 and get shot for shoes
Turn 15 and get shot in school
Get too upset when I watch the news
So I just hit the strip in the drop top and cruise
Please Lord don’t fail me now
This partnership’s a cooperation
I’m on the job and know who to boss
So make living longer my occupation
They always told me that money talks
I always loved a good conversation
But they ain’t seein’ who behind the wheel
So let’s drop the top so they not mistaken (I’m)

[Outro]
Slow loud and bangin’
Amazing
Diamonds gainst the wheel ’cause it always make me feel (alright)
Diamonds gainst the wheel ’cause it always make me feel alright
Slow loud and bangin’
Slow loud and bangin’
Slow loud and bangin’
(Alright)
