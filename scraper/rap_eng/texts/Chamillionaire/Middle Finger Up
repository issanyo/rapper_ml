[Intro - Chamillionaire - talking] (*echo*)
Yeah, uh
And I'm feelin like
And I'm feelin like

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Yeah, and I'm feelin like, what the heck is this? If you say a diss
I'mma tell you this, you gon' shoot and miss, I'm a shoot and hit
Never blow a kiss, all I blow is chips
X you off the list, can't coexist, you ain't gon' be missed
Steady stackin chips, lookin at the wrist
Tryin to see a gliss, you ain't makin this, see you gettin pissed
Good relationship, bad relationship, no relationship
Guess it's cool for you to say I got a gift
If you ain't on a team, you ain't on a team
We gon' be supreme, you can do your thing, out the limousine
If you on a team, roll on with the dream
Tryin to get ring, you gon' get a ring, you gon' be a king
I ain't sixteen, I ain't seventeen
Tell me what you mean, I'm a grown man, I be gettin green
Don't be sippin lean, tell me what you mean
Never movin slow, quickest to the dough, I be gettin green
Handle the dough, hand me some more, gamble it?
'No', got a kid that I'm grabbin it for
Psych, I ain't got a kid, if I ever did
Then he know it's his, have a hundred million 'fore I go
Asking me yo, after the show, what's your legacy?
Did you really go platinum or gold?
Answer them 'no,' can't really show
None of that in heaven, so I never really answered 'em so
He got upset, he tryin to get, on the internet
Tryin to tell 'em I ain't jammin no more
Can't dance on the flo', brag on the flo'
Feelin like my voice really givin romance to the flo'
Sad for the dough, mad for the dough
Bad for the dough, all of it and not half of the dough
Faster I go, crash for the dough, now I got to go
Cause I think a couple of fans comin bro

[Hook - Chamillionaire]
I hate you (you), you hate me (me)
You think I'm livin for you, then you must be crazy
My middle finger up, middle finger up
Middle finger up, middle finger up, middle finger up
Middle finger up, middle finger up, middle finger up
Money don't make me

I hate you (you), you hate me (me)
Can't tell me how to live my life because you ain't me
My middle finger up, middle finger up
Middle finger up, middle finger up, middle finger up
Middle finger up, middle finger up, middle finger up
For those who hate me

[Break - Chamillionaire - talking]
This song's for you
If you woke up this morning thinkin about what you gon' do to hate on somebody
Who's tryin to build a dynasty, a legacy (hello to my haters)
I hope you see this when you look in the mirror
My middle finger up, middle finger up

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
What you want to do? You don't have a clue, you was never true
Meet me any place, you can get erased
I'm a break your face, let 'em make a case, let a hater sue
Got a little problem with BCD, I ain't ever authorize this CD
Holla at my lawyer, you can't see me
See me in the Aston Martin, I'm like "beep beep"
Boys back in school, they was tryin to talk down
Platinum pot of gold, yeah that's what ya boy found
Lookin like a fool, tell me how they talk now
Runnin around the town, but I swear the boy clown
How you talk trash, when it's you that I fed?
Yeah I talk trash, cause of you I ain't scared
Tell me that I changed, cause I grew and got bread
Sayin that it's strange, that it's you that's not bled
Down on the ground, clown of the town
Say it to my face, you can find me, I'm a be around
Want to play the game? Step up to the mound
Want to be a snake? I'm a be a shark, I'm a see you drown

[Hook]
