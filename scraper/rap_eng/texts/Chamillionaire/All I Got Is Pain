[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
All I feel is pain
Yeah, that's what I'm about
You hear it every time that I talk
All I got is pain
I'm going insane, I feel it in my veins
All I got is pain
If you wondering (Pain) why I'm not smilin' (Pain)
It's because I can't hide it (Feel it, baby)
All I got is pain
I'm going insane, I feel it in my veins
All I got is pain

[Famous]
With so much pain
Some time it get hard to cope
And I be hidin' my emotions so it's hard to show
The way I feel about shit only God to know
And he know I won't quit with so far to go
I wanna slab a few cribs and my squad to blow
A wife, a few kids, livin' far from broke
I wanna be the life kids never offered hope
Thinkin' the world so dirty, let me offer soap
Feeling like you in a snow storm and lost your coat
In the middle of a ocean and you lost your boat
Got fronted three keys and you lost your door (Damn!)
And you fronter ain't a fronter and he at ya' door

[Chamillionare]
All I feel is pain...
All I got is pain...
All I got is pain...

[Famous]
Like umbrellas better open up
The game shoulda soaked it up
Be tryin bust you cokin up
Over what?
Over what? Shit root of all evil
And I didn't see what it do to all people
We all equal in the eyes of the man
And I see Jenna Six, shit had me like "Damn!"
The fuck goin' on with the nonsense
I wanna rap about 'bout ice, but what about my conscience? (What about it?)
Nonsense fame flow what you wanna
Shoot dice, fuck hoes, smoke marijuana
On the cool my generation is some gonna
So I fall on my knees the last days our partner

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
All I feel is pain
Yeah, that's what I'm about
You hear it every time that I talk
All I got is pain
I'm going insane I feel it in my veins
All I got is pain
If you wondering (Pain) why I'm not smilin' (Pain)
It's because I can't hide it (Feel it, baby)
All I got is pain
I'm going insane I feel it in my veins
All I got is pain

[Chamillionaire]
All I got is pain...
All I got is pain...
