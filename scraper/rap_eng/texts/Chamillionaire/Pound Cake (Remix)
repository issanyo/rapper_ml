[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days. You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last, all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Couple investments, a few of 'em made some major sense
Keep your two pennies, especially if you ain't made a cent
I learned the game and been getting publishing ever since
People that ain't made a dollar will say they ain't convinced
When you ride to 7-11 on some handle bars
You can't vision how catchy hooks could take a man to Mars
The problem is, y'all only just wanna hang with stars
Heard Lauryn sing and I wanted to take the world from Nas
I salute, but I still demand applause
I've given infinite gifts, I still feel like Santa Claus
Males acting like girls I call it mano-pause
This the type of verse that I bet you that type of man would pause
I can't stop and give these haters what they ask for
99 thousand or more inside a cash drawer
I'm the type to keep a passport on the dashboard, looking for a south of France shore to make a dash for
Feeling like Damon Dash, but I move that acappella
When times is bleak, I hit the freeway like it's Roc-A-Fella
It's been a decade, get a clue that you could stop me never
You'd have a better chance of trying to stop a hot propeller

[Hook: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a karat cake
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just gettin' started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cham made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel
