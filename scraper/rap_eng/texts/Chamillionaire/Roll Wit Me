(Verse 1, Chamillionaire)
When I pull up at the car wash
Them hoes gon' do what we tell 'em
If it's not, it's not
From the rocks
How 'bout you get to detailin'?
Sprewellin', femalin'
Her friend think we weed sellin'
So many bad yellow hoes
You know they think that we sell 'em
He yellin' bout his broad
Now he gon' bring it
Goin' through wit' them
Tell ya hooligans
To the Phantom
Bring ya Rugers in
I slap 'em
It look like I ran a dagger through ya chin
Makin' you a rim, they yellin' stop
But I bet'chu was dead
I'm V.I.P, P
I vroom up in the pussy
Then I flee, she
Look kinda like that chick from BET, T
Out at 106th and park, my ride for free
But my hoes gotta pay for me, haha
You know that Cham is the bread crook
That'll hit'cha man wit the left hook
Chamillionaire, Balance and Stat
He apparently get took
Playas get chose
Pay for it, no
That habit, ya get shook
You wanna be wit Chamillionaire?
You gotta balance a check-book

(Verse 2, Balance)
Yo

The nigga who these chicks wanna see, see
They whoa up, hold up, slow up, look at me, me
Dippin', sippin', trippin' off of E, E
She jerkin', perkin', workin', poppin' P, P
Now pills wit pussy push, they pushin' me, me
To get up in her quick, they pickin' three, three
Four, five, six, got a light-skinned chick
Wit' bout four, five chicks, make a V, V
So we can get to floatin' on them ki's, ki's
I ain't drivin', she be drivin', ridin' me, me
Bumpin' Pac, Eyes On Me, repeatin' number three, three
She's "Scandelous"
She act just like an evangelist

If you talk smack, you'll get jacked (Get jacked)

Every time a nigga hit the mall
You don't wanna see it or be it

Away from him, cause him will pull out a Glock
Start bustin' to make yo frame drop (Frame drop)
