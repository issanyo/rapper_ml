Know I had to do it

Mixtape Messiah 5

That's right

Somebody need to give me a solid definition of what swag is
Is that when your bank account get built up so high that everybody come out trying to sue you so they can get their piece of the pie

Is that swag huh?

Or maybe it's when the major label call you and ask you when your next mixtape dropping because they know you gonna have the streets on smash

Is that swag?

Or maybe it's just a whole bunch of punch lines bragging how you ball with no purpose at all

You already know I can do that... I can do that

[Verse:]
CHAMILLII!

Uh uh uh

Let me start like this try to put on skinny jeans and couldn't zip my zip
Nah let me be blunt real quick I don't wear skinny jeans cause my dick don't fit
Always keep a maggy close to me like lisa you know they keep a lot of cheese on me like pizza
I came y'all back was like mika y'all better keep ya eyes on me like features
Never be mislead, I don't care what any side-switching fickle fan said
Yea still street like greg hit you with a speaker they gonna call you bass head
Bought a motorcycle cause I'm normally one deep crocodile on the seats you can call it Dundee
Kickers in the trunk tryna do the chung lee yup yup try to bit the wallet do the gumbee
Stretching my cream stretching stretching my cream cash rules everything I'm the meth of my scene
Come to Texas we can bet that I'm king I'm the best in real life and nothing less in my dreams
Cars got the screens that they have at homes cribs got the same size pillars that they had in Rome
Traveled way to Rome just to grab a phone I ain't even turn it on... ha
Paris Hilton got a man named benji and she love him I'm in Paris with the benjis maannn and we hustlinn
Meanwhile I'm in customs chains so big we lookin like we munchkins
Ask yo bank teller
Bet she know a player
Money ova here
You way over there
You got swag? Tell me why I'm supposed to care M.O.E. is me you more like money over whereee?
She said she independent like she signed a cotch I told her time is money so she grab my watch
Got stocks, got rocks, got Glocks remy isn't dusty cause I still ain't take it out the box
I keep a big whip like Indiana Jones and big size rims without my have it on
I be terrorizing every jamming song, ya'll on T-Pain dick leave that man alone
Act like you don't know me, I mean the new me, forget the old me
I dip a bullet in syrup and you can O D on chopped and screwed bullets competition die slowly
I'm like the man named Pac, on a whole other level plus I'm eating that's fact
Matter fact you can take swag back, that's the word rapper's saying when they know they can't rap
But your confidence higher than the stewardess, just wanna laugh when I ask you who ya jeweler is
H - A – M - M - O so humorous bank getting paid don't believe me you can Google this
Got a major deal when the Boston green diamonds why you waste yo skrill
I buy green diamond it's a baseball field nothing little league about me I got major bills
Money like mutumbo, tall like this, money got a mumble and it talk like this
If money talks baby pardon my lips, Ben Franklin always with me like he part of my click
And I don't be in the strip club every night, but I tell her keep the tax like you Wesley Snipes
Even the white girls tryin to get the pipe all the bullets last like a nestle bite
The industry ain't something that I feel is fair, don't care you well-rounded you just filled with squares
So I don't care unless there's bout a million shares standing on the million lookin up like it's a billion where?
And I am so sincere, I'm the baddest rapper here let's just get this clear
And I wish I made you would kick me out my dear cause I been the richest independent you should fear
No one on the corner moves mixtapes like me but I won't tell you how many incriminate thee
M – I – X – T – A – P - E street money make me sound like Lil' Boosie
Can't get no money because he don't move no birds, can't get no money because he don't usually curse
Mixtape Messiah 5 baby you deserve some alphabet soup so you can eat your words
