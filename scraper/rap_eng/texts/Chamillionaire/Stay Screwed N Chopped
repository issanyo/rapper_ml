(Intro:)
I'm about to lose my mind
I've being doing this so looong
Why they stay talking dowwwn
Like stay screwed n' chopped up
Stay screwed n' chopped up
Mayne stay screwed n' chopped up, chopped up
And slow it down one more time

(Verse 1:)
Picture a world with no hater's mayne I can only imagine
All this success I'm grabbing
Hate they don't have what I'm havin
I heard a clown say he mad and felt like I left screw abandoned
And also said that the white boy that's on my left wasn't jammin
And where were you when slim thugga
Purchased his first set of davins
Where were you when the world was tellin us this couldn't happen
Now all the wood that I'm grabbing my caddy
Look like a cabin and yea I did it rapping
Reason you didn't is yapping
They thought that cleving and acrum was super easy we packed in
A bunch of cd's with wrapping it wasn't easy to track em
Looks super easy we stacking but wasn't't easy what happened
Is all the leechers attached and they started reaching n jacking
Ask me how many bootleggers we had to run up n handle
Ask me how many flute tellers we had ta come n dismantle
So when you see me out standing there like a boss in the flesh
You ain't got to get on your knees but just know that you have blessed, I feel like

(Chorus:)
I'm about to lose my mind
I've being doing this so loong
And boys stay talking downnnn
Like stay screwed n' chopped up
Stay screwed n' chopped up
Mayne stay screwed n' chopped up, chopped up
And slow it down one more time

(Verse 2:)
Uh, what you mean
I already did my thing
I forever be the king
Just like the name on that black women in swimsuit magazine
Stay hopping out of my porsche puttin these boys under my wing
I taught you how to be safer when the industry tried to break ya, showed ya to watch out for fakers
And taught you how not to date her
I got it from master p and j. prince, d-rek, tony draper
Then I used it just to get paper
Then sit court side for the lakers
What the hell is ya'll saying
I got a ring that say kiss me
Only a loser would diss me
Like he ain't being watching history
I held it down for h the banner first said missippipi
And held it down for you losers
When they was in chucks and dickies
Rapping backwards on rap city
Yea that was all in the past
But I don't see noone right now that's bad enough to take all this cash that's right in my path
New artist yea they might tell ya you gifted
But you better not get this game twisted cause that will get you evicted get out cause

(Chorus)
I'm about to lose my mind
I've being doing this so loong
And boys stay talking downnnn
Like stay screwed n' chopped up
Stay screwed n' chopped up
Mayne stay screwed n' chopped up, chopped up
And slow it down one more time

Ahhhhhh one more timmmmee
Hmmmmmm like stay screwed n chopped up
Stay screwed n chopped up
Mayne stay screwed n chopped up, chopped up
And slow it down one more time
