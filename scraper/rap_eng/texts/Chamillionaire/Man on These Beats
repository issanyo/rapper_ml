[Intro]
I mean somebody gonna have to get a nigga on the phone
Know what I'm saying?
Straight up. We gotta get to the bottom of this (Houston, there's a problem)
I must have missed that news bulletin
Ain't fell off, baby
Still here, baby
Thousands and thousands of mixtapes strong
It's the Messiah, nigga
It's the king, Koopa
You know who that is
Yeah

[Bridge]
Last time I checked I was the man on these beats
And they say it's all about supply and demand on these streets
Chamillitary's that label they demanding for me
Give a damn about a rapper, I'm the man on these beats

[Verse 1]
Look at the game, look at these lames
Looks like it's lame season
Fit in the game, get in the game
Quick and I ain't leaving
Sitting on swangs, switching the lane
Fifth in my bang beatin, huh
I'm doing my thing, man, you blind if you ain't seeing
Cause I'm the dopest rapper from Houston if they don't mention dog
Ask him and if he don't say me then he one that prevents it y'all (uh uh)
It ain't gone happen 'cause I was meant to ball
I can't help it
They get mad, look in the wind and the fender falls
So I protect my pot of gold like a leprechaun
Without the green suit I'd rather put a weapon on
Boys on the eastside like them two niggas next to John
Now they say Chamillionare equal to the letters next to Bun
Trill
And the answer to the game, huh
So you still lose whether you get it right or get it wrong
They said I would fall off
But they didn't write it down in stone
Talking low but I hear every word like that whisper song (yeah)
I'm young, rich and flagrant
Tell the referee that I'm foul
He just ran into my first
That nigga slipped and it said "pow!"
