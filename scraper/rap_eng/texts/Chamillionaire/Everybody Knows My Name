[Intro: Charlie Boy & *Chamillionaire*]
Everybody Know My Name
*Uh Chamillitary mayne*
Knockin bitch niggas out the flame
Mayne

[Verse 1: Charlie Boy]
Lil mama I'm fly (I'm fly)
I'm throwed (I'm throwed)
Ya ain't seen a playa like me befo'
Real niggas recognize, bad bitches bop
I trap twenty minutes hit the mall and brought a shop
Lil buddy I'm raw (I'm raw)
I show ass (I show ass)
Got a lot of toys cause a nigga play with cash
Swangs drops on glass, truck got beat
Fuck a strip club I make it rain in the street
No bumping, cause I'm packing
Ridin' 4's till them hoes start clacking
Please try jackin' I show ya what's happening
It's huntin' season and my whole squad trapping
Blessed outta made it, dressed in the latest
Question all the haters been claiming that they the greatest
Reading too slow you ain't on the same pages
Step ya game up, cause your boys outrageous
Breaking out cages, stacking big faces
Straight, we call em, all you losers disgraces
Tighten up your lace and poppin' bottles by the cases
Rollin' hard jaw liken like I got braces
Mayne

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
I'm fly (I'm fly)
I'm throwed (I'm throwed)
I'm coming down on a set of new vogues
Grippin' that oak with my diamonds exposed
Back in the streets I'm in underground mode
Mayne
Kill a career with a verse, I show up at the funeral
Trunk poppin' my beat knockin' yeah D-T-P in like Luda do
Better have my money baby, cash would be what suitable
Cause yo head is like the top that's on my drop removable
My naked lady she a clown but they say jackers tryin' find her
I pull out that ragged shiner now my lady looking finer
Underground we gotta eat, let me take you to the diner
Paint syrup that's Aunt Jemima it's like she my new desinger
I got doe but it's a curse, get girls but money worse
They say you can't take it wit ya so I put a safe in a herse
Candy skirt gone make em hurt, man I better go get the work
I swang down my driveway and then I "err" and hit reverse
Koopa, yep I'm still the man, still the man that a still the man
I still the man like the Estella's fan and you out of bounds like you Moreno Dan
I be getting that green baby, boy seems like they mad at that
Every time I grab a stack I'll look just like a Cabbage Patch
