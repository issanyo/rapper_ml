I'm in the zone, let's go!

I don't mean to brag
But my cash long
Yeah I feel like I'm worth a million bucks
Yeah, I'm counting 100's
Yeah-ah-ah
Got that corporate swag
And my cash long
But in the streets I could make a million bucks
Yeah, show me the money
Yeah-ah-ah

You be local, I'mma be in London, no Lauren
They claim to do it for the block cause they're the ones not touring
Ain't believing in these streets rappers claim to be on
They really in front of Ning like Alonzo Mourn (Internet)
At the rucca with the blucca cause the worth of my charm
Street baller, ain't no need to even work on my form
King of the underground, feel like the mixtape Bun
Label don't even want to move until my mixtape's done
Bad breezy in the A, that do whatever I want
And she say that's right, okay, and yeah like she Lil Jon
Sleeping over in the dorm with your chick is a norm'
In the jacuzzi with my BlackBerry on like I'm Run
Look into my iPhone if a bad chick what you want
Hype Williams sneak a peak, and Big Pimpin' was born
Swag deposit in my closet, take whatever you want
So many horses that my stylist call me Polow da Don
I be working until dawn, ladies say I ain't fun
I ain't down with that complaining so right now you been warned
X'd out of my black booklet you don't wanna be one
So many X's they addresses looking like it's some porn
And that's just my x-man but she still on my arm
I send her to Magic City you gon' think that she storm
She turn over in the morn', she can bet I'll be gone
Should'a known that dot com, be a member and join

Cause when she hop up out the bed, I'mma be gone
On my grind before you even wake up
Yeah, I know you love me
Yeah-ah-ah

I don't like no competition so I guess that I'm greedy
I walk in Michael Jordan's kitchen and walk out with his Wheaties
So much jewelry that my closet looking frosted as Jeezy
Closet freezy, looking like that big commercial on TV
Rollin' wit a chick magnet I call Arab money
Could wake up in your momma's bed like I'm your step dad, dummy
I'm too sick another's nostrils ain't gon' get that runny
Pimpin' Kenneth and Hugh Hefner, I could pimp that bunny
Chamilli is the truth, puke is what I induce
I'm so sick that if I spit it look like Cranberry Juice
Look who's touching on the head, you could say that she loose
I lean backwards while your chick is playing duck, duck, goose
These rappers can't see me just call me the hidden truth
And I'm probably about to wreck it unless there's a hidden booth
All these rappers is fruity but don't ask me for proof
They so sweet, I can't name them without chippin' a tooth
Not in my Fave 5, not part of my business group
So when your chick get in the coup, she's part of my chicken coop
You don't know who always kill it, you need to be introduced
And you need to just keep one eye on me like Zeus
Cause really

I don't mean to brag
But my cash long
Yeah I feel like I'm worth a million bucks
Yeah, I'm counting 100's
Yeah-ah-ah
Got that corporate Swag
And my cash long
But in the streets I could make a million bucks
Yeah, show me the money
Yeah-ah-ah
