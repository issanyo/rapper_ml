[Hook]
In this game it seems that I'm lyrically reaching a point where it's not fair no more
Hit 'em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy
It's like I'm bringing war to your front door
In this game it seems that I'm lyrically reaching a point where it's not fair no more
Hit 'em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy
It's like I'm bringing war to your front door, front door

[Verse 1]
Look how lyrically I assassinate a verse then
I can get a hooker shot like urban
You never bust rapping just like you a virgin
Under your girl done hitting a belly like a surgeon
A hundred milli gotta get it brrr Birdman
Christina Milian she ain't got her man
And I don't have no dreams either, I'm working
Surfing the earth and tryna stay urban
You see the heater poking out I got the shirt in
All of these rappers getting jerked without the jurgens
The similes and metaphors that I be serving
Gone right over their head, hot turbans
I got a ?? and she a Persian
Ain't got a deal with Eminem but I am burning
Hot, got a lawyer he's really a diversion
I'm riding dirtier than 30 days with no detergent
Ain't really with the beef but the tweets I get at you
If I ever see you in the streets I'mma slap you
I don't mean LeBron when the Heat coming at you
Cover up and duck like I'm late tattoo
All this cake getting flipped like a spatula
Not an act like a chat I'm a natural
Suits tried to take me out the game what did that do
Still here like the name of an ear statue
Bread cheese here funds really high
Walk in the strip club and throw my lunch in the sky
Front til you die while I spend a month in Dubai
I'm a god in the streets alhamdulillah
Test and I bet that you gon' flunk when you try
I don't even gotta use my gun to reply
You get punched in the eye, punched in the eye
What is a tie? Ayuken blood finna fly

In this game it seems that I'm lyrically reaching a point where it's not fair no more

[Verse 2]
See the barrel shoot in the tank I'm in the cockpit
Bullets that'll jump on your head like it's a moshpit
Even if you're wearing a bulletproof outfit
I got a Batman you who I'm Robin like a sidekick
The rap game really my chick
Topic is whether Chamillionaire is the topic
Put 'em on the line I'm telling you that I got this
Autograph the weapon I'm hitting you with a shot whip
Most high multi-million dollar bow tie
Still be a clown it's equivalent to cho cha
Go and die know why he will tell the most lies
Most likely to get hit with the four-five
Yo price pow hit 'em with the scorcher
What you know about the Chinese, water torture
Can't run from the lyricism cause it caught ya
Write it then I'm in your nightmare like an author
West craving the world what I'm saving
I got a hollow tip that I brought for the occasion
I put it in a weapon that was made by an Asian
My mind is a maze and that means that I'm amazing
Your girl call me papi coming with a posse
Everybody black I'm the opposite of nazi
In the major label they be thinking I'm Gaddafi
I'm taking out anyone who thinkin' they can stop me
