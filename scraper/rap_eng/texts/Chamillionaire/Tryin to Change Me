[Intro - Chamillionaire - talking]
(Chamillitary mayne)
Hey I'ma go ahead and keep it real
I ain't taken media training, know what I'm sayin?
I just feel like I just wanna do me (that's right)
Know what I'm talkin 'bout?
They know who I am (yeah)
Chamillinator, Mixtape Messiah 2
Lets go

[Chorus - Chamillionaire - 2X] ("hey" repeated in third and fourth lines of Chorus)
They keep on tryin change me
But y'all know I'ma gon' always keep it street
I'm the hustle man, up in these streets
I make what you made in a year in a week

[Interlude - Chamillionaire - talking]
Hey look, it's the Chamillinator
And you're tuned into Mixtape Messiah Part 2
And the ad libs say it all, I do it big baby
Ultimate Victory, March 27th, haha, watch out
Y'all know what time it is

{Break - Chamillionaire - talking over Interlude]
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
I do it big!
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
I do it big!
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
I do it big!
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
I do it big!

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
I got a hungry fanbase in the streets, so I gotta feed it
Mixtape Messiah, completed, history get repeated
What up Cham? It's Universal, where's your album? We need it
Like "Ridin Dirty," can you beat it? *er*, message deleted
Gettin throwed off in the crowd, make it look like a brawl (brawl)
If anything get throwed into yours, it look like a towel (towel)
Keep that look right off your face, because it look like a scowl
These suckers think that I'ma sucker, eeeah, ain't one of y'all
My fanbase is a cult, they doin everything that I tell 'em
Appreciate me, keepin it real and purchase everything that I sell 'em
Couldn't get down with that slavery so at labels I wasn't gellin
Now I can ball like Tevin, on the Northside of Levin Reverend
Hallelujah, I made a considerable amount of moolah
So I boota, the world I'ma dangerous as the shooter
Hallelujah, they love how I lyrically send hollows through ya
Not a ruger, but I do got the flow that be goin BOOYAH!
I ain't never really been trippin about it, if you got your posse
Cause I got some partners with me that will pop off like paparazzi
Don't try to see me and show me some love, tellin me that you got me
Takin over's my new hobby and you ain't 'bout to stop me
I let a woman show up late (late), ain't really no need to clock her
They say that time is money, if she's late then it will cost her
I let a woman off her leash (leash), ain't really no need to watch her
They act right, like a Oscar is something I got to offer
Hey, so get your act on just like Kevin Costner
And I continue to be the Mixtape Mi-Mi-Mivasa
They say that talk is cheap, so don't come to me bein a talker
50K is what conversation with me will cost ya

[Chorus]

[Break]
