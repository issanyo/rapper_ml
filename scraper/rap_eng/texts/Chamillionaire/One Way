[Verse 1]
White tee money gang
We staying with the fitted on
Pockets on rose, ? tryna get it on
Lounging, dirty Sprite, even dirtier
Thoughts on how to come up on a Thursday night
If it ain't about bread I don't
Kick no knowledge. You wanna learn something?
Take your broke ass to college
I ain't a role model, crack don't stop
Money then we money grabbing back up top
But naw, I ain't flashing mine, see me
Flash my rings, waving a hammer
Like a glass of wine. What else?
It's MOE, I told the judge I ain't budge
It's either him or me

[Hook - Chamillionaire]
One way in, one way out
In this hood, you gotta plan your way out
Streets is a maze, if you make it out
Just tryna get paid, it's a
Muthafuckin drought. It's so easy
To be all about my money living
In these days, niggas tryna get
Something from me, but no..

I know, I know..

[Verse 2]
Sucka niggas is blonde bimbos
Edie Hathaway, I'm jumping out the window
Act like the beats dropping like Timbo
Land like we flying, crash like cymbals
Look here, I'm bossed up in my Outlaw
Outwear, telling niggas out my chair
Yeah, warrior shit and ain't a foot
In glorious shit, getting to the money
Down to get more of this shit
Cause we hustle all day and all night
And we ain't stopping til we get it right
C'mon! Cause we hustle all day and all night
And we ain't stopping til we get it right
Shorty, better than I could tell you
If you really from the hood
Every ghetto is familiar
Everybody struggling, everybody hustling
Tryna make ends' meet, gotta lay out 6 feet
On your knees, I'mma get a list
I ain't trickin on these bitches
With a stack of my business
Let's get it! When you doing good
Everybody fucking with you
When that drought hit, ain't
Nobody fucking with you
I'm just tryna paint a picture here
So you could see. Real niggas can make it
It's up to you and me
Tryna find thoughts, insane, no love
In the land of the lost
I'mma get mine

[Hook - Chamillionaire]
One way in, one way out
In this hood, you gotta plan your way out
Streets is a maze, if you make it out
Just tryna get paid, it's a
Muthafuckin drought. It's so easy
To be all about my money living
In these days, niggas tryna get
Something from me, but no..

[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire]
The birds fly South, but I was headed North
Watching while my parents dealing with divorce
Also was watching Diddy chilling in The Source
Thinking that I'm about to get it
Bout to kill a corpse. They say the court
Was the better way to get abortion
I said of course, but everybody isn't good at sports
Can't get endorsed when you always
Sitting in the courts
And anyway, the money love me like it's intercourse
So now I gotta get a voice
I gotta hop up out the hoopty and
Go get a Royce, government make you
Feel like you don't get a choice, pass the torch
And when we coming for you ?
