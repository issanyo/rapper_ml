[Intro]
It's Aktion on the beats, bitch

[Verse 1: Futuristic]
Yeah, yeah, I'm tryna get Benz, big crib for me and all of my friends
We ain't gotta do shit but fuck hoes and it
Get a spot down the road, a studio and a stage
A place with like two tousand of hoes in it
Show niggas with the [?] out
Court in the backyard, we can ball out
Take couple shots and the joint, play rock and then Daft Punk then watch a boy fall out
Crawl out when it's lunch time, like, bitch, I'm hungry
My niggas dumb, but my niggas dougie
My bitches love me, my niggas rich
So bitches don't care if my niggas ugly
That shit is funny, how the game change
Clean money, no riding dirty
Get brain with nerdie, stay fresh, detergent
Ain't going to sleep 'til like nine thirty in the AM
I'm on TV, just like the geico caveman
Talk shit, I got security to act quick, hit you in the chest, make this shit cave in
Started from the basement
Killing everything they're throwing me, like Freddy vs. Jason
And if I got old and I still got flows
Imma hit the doc up, tell him that I need a facelift, ah

[Hook: Chamillionaire & Futuristic]
I'm just a hustler tryna get dough, I'm just tryna
I'm just a hustler tryna get it, I'm just tryna
I'm just a hustler tryna get dough, I'm just tryna
I'm just a hustler tryna get it, I'm just tryna
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, I'm just a hustler tryna
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, I'm just a hustler tryna
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, forever

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Alright, I'm known to do what I want, what's that?
Impossible, it's just hard work
Y'all know I never let dough [?] it
Get out my seat and then bomb first
Weapons all on my dot com
Press a button then launch merch
They always told me that money talks
So I called it up, let's converse, hello, who this, what's up
Y'all searching me like I'm googlelicious
You know I'm eating, what y'all eating?
Should make you come through the dishes
It's the future with Futuristic
When groupies call it, don't usually kick it
A couple of them looks bad as well
Don't really wanna get too specific
Get more, get more
We don't really need map quest
If you really tryna locate the dough
Then I'll you straight to that adress, uh
Counted up, it's your map test
It's the future, no past tense
I ain't worried 'bout your life
Cause that ain't the place that my cash went

[Hook: Chamillionaire & Futuristic]
I'm just a hustler tryna get dough, I'm just tryna
I'm just a hustler tryna get it, I'm just tryna
I'm just a hustler tryna get dough, I'm just tryna
I'm just a hustler tryna get it, I'm just tryna
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, I'm just a hustler tryna
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, I'm just a hustler tryna
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, forever

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
Shit, I's get it, I's get it, like a church passed
And nigga, I'm commited to my strange money, damn honey
You didn't know I was the main honey?
Buns around me, like top bridges
Get different strokes for different folks
I ease the paper, no prob', nigga
Call me Kutt Calhoun, I bearly go, hustle
Two hundred plus cities yearly rode want for nothing
Independent, my buisness stand for me speding Benjamin's, like [?]
I'm on merch to resale, had some jerseys, booty shorts and all sorts of shirts for females
Calculating, do the math, trigonometry too many numbers for me to add up ?
Fuck it, Imma make my's not important
See? Kutt Calhoun is a brand name
All the pencil's how you indorse it
If it ain't working, don't force it
Maybe this ain't a part of your fortune
So in the mean time, Chamillionaire let [?] drop in the chours

[Hook: Chamillionaire & Futuristic]
I'm just a hustler tryna get dough, I'm just tryna
I'm just a hustler tryna get it, I'm just tryna
I'm just a hustler tryna get dough, I'm just tryna
I'm just a hustler tryna get it, I'm just tryna
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, I'm just a hustler tryna
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, I'm just a hustler tryna
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, forever
