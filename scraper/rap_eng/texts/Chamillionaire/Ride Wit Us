(*talking*)
G'eah know I'm saying, it's going down right now
We got three legends in here
And we'd like to welcome everybody, to the South
Know I'm tal'n bout, so we gon take you on a lil' tour
And show you how we do it, where we come from
Know I'm saying, or like we say know I'm tal'n bout
(already, know I'm saying hey it's Koopa uh)

[Chamillionaire]
Stay froze up with the bluest wrist, stay coming through in the newest whip
Stay iced out like a new refrig-erator, say I do it big
Cause they know I do and they know it's true, and you mad when nobody don't notice you
Cause we rolling through and they know it too, Chamilitary it's Chamilitary known to do
What they can't million dollar crib, multi-million dollar deal
Multi-colored diamond grill, it's my multi-million dollar year
I'm for real I'm for real, it's the truth of the streets really trying to feel
Behind the wheel grinding still, cause I'm trying to feel on a diamond wheel
Swang the swangas with the swang and banga, in Suburbans and drops
When we pop up, niggas know what time it is like the Burger King watch
If they don't then they can get beef, like it's a Burger King stop
Make an order get your recorder, while I murder it pop
I got my hand on my phone, they say it don't look like my phone
Police trying to catch me riding dirty, that's my clip and my chrome uh
Give me back my weapon you wise guy, stop hating cause the way a nigga ride fly
Turn all the speakers up in the fly ride, have a nigga block sounding like a drive by

[Hook]
If you wanna ride with us, you gotta be down to bust
If you wanna ride with us, talking to my G's and hustlers
If you wanna ride with us, 24's up on the truck
If you wanna ride with us, let me see ya throw your side up

[E.S.G.]
Ride with us or come roll with me, E.S.G. and my dog Bun B
And the C-H-A-M-I double L-I-O-N-A to the I-R-E
Me and Pimp C in a Bentley mayn, million sold independent mayn
Told you boys you ain't eat like us, trunk'll pop but u ain't beat like us
O.G. out the S.U.C., 0-7 ESV
R.I.P. to my dog Todd Profit, DJ Screw and P-A-T
ATL gon trap with it, rock and finger snap with it
H-Town slow it down, chop and double tap with it
Louisiana pop jiggas with it, diamond grill and get triller with it
Sipping lean with the championship team, watch me Pittsburgh Stealer with it
Fish scale like a real O.G., too many e-mails for me to read
Www.myspace.com, forward slash yup E.S.G
Independent I'm a giant, backhand boys who act defiant
36 OZ wave my wand, go fade the one like Kobe Bryant
Never seen purple smoke this strong, big old spokes'll poke out on chrome
Leave it alone or get chrome to the dome, represent for your home if you know this song

[Hook]

[Bun B]
I got the keys in the ignition, the dro up in the gaurd
Candy dripping off my swisher shoes, cup in my car
I'm a ghetto superstar, I can cut any corner
Get to flipping and flossing, through any hood that I wanna
Bun B back up in the slab, navigating the town
Chunking deuces and showing love, when I'm coming around
I don't have to wanna try to be down, I been a G with it
All the game need, is Bun B and Pimp C in it
Underground King, P.A.T. that's where I'm from
Representing, until they send me back to kingdom come
Hustlers they want my downfall, short stoppers want my cuts
Rappers wanna take my spot, but they can all just get my nuts
Fingers up haters down, free the Pimp that's the drill
Lady shining on the grill, that's how we keep it trill
Diamonds up against the wood, pistol on my side
Banging Screw that's how we do in Texas, that's how we ride

[Hook]
