-Chamillionaire-
Who the trillest
The answer you thought you knew it
You blew it thats why they drew it
The pistol soon as it hits you
You wish you never do it
Bang till your brain spew it
Houston is full of sewege
Its true it ain't nothing to it
They will do it act like you knew it
See i ain't really got to prove it
Look around and it show
Cause most of these n***** we use to know ain't even around here no mo
But don't drown in your flow
Cause its deeper look around and hell no
This ain't Cleveland it don't be frezzing but boys around here with snow
Redefining my hoe
They think she on the side when she wit em, she ridin and flippin in your car
You see that wire that's sticking
Out her bra federal car right behind him is picking his a** up
But damn broh (damn broh)
They done found them a victim, (damn)
Walk with me through that spaceship city
Where that 9 is the law
Channal 13 preview that scene
Who did that crime to that boy
Walk in on that red carpet
Ain't the kind the stars be walking on
Chalk is shown (is that right)
Outline with that scar (damn)

-Hook-
It's real on these streets
Niggas be toting heat on these streets
Puting bustas to sleep on these streets
Playing for keeps in these streets
I ougth to eat off these streets
Your momma weep
Cause now you lay dead on these streets
X2 n****

-B.G.-
Where I'm from we play it raw
We cutthtroat and bout our business
Some call it New Orleans
But I nicknamed it Chopper City
Its the home of the Hornets
And the home of the Saints
But don't get that name twisted
We'll toss you off in a lake
If you want work
We'll tell you we got weight
Tax him 22 for a burner, flour, or cake
N**** ride fly in benzes on 22s
Double back drop 26s under the H2
I'm a fool wit it
Hoes be like i want him
Fresh Dickie shirt over my tee with some bos and tims
I'm a hot boy
If you ain't know ask somebody
On Valence and Magnolia
I'm like the Don John Gotti
Don't try me or you'll end up a nobody
On a front of a tee
With your people second line
And its like that
I ain't the one to size up
Cause if you do me that
Then i'ma have to fie up

(Hook)
-Stat Quo-
Track bang, (track bang)
Pimp ho like good game
Got damn shame
That boy there got good aim
Across the globe
He got pulled like hair strains
Stat Quo the beast
Big Bread my nickname
Trunk pop the show
My verse is spiritual
Test me and your condition
Will end up critical
Started from the A
Why he spit so lyrical
He not right for the hood
He a south coast miracle
For the strippers, hustlas
And common criminals
9 to 5 workers, lieutenants and generals
? to struggle
The grind will injure you
It takes more than crutches
To make it through
I'm telling you

(Hook)
-Soulja Slim-
What you're hearing is uptown
Is y'all fimilar with that sound
A hundred rounds will gun you down
Put your b**** a** underground
Now i want you to know
See i'ma general
Is there a heaven or hell
Tell me where the killers go
My pill busting slow
Fill up the dro
I'm bout to tell em
What they need to know don't f*** wit us we creepin low
He out that 13th, he out that 17th
I'm out that muthaf***in 3-9
Who want beef
I'll be damn if grown killas stay humble
I could get ya killed
Without uppin the bundle
Magnolia that's my project
Never call it a jungle
Keep a spot on the block
And a key of dope to fumble
I'm down south hustlin
Get paid in many ways
If your lick ova a hundred g's
I'm comin to bust yo head
I say f*** the feds
And i'll say it again
From the streets to the pen
I play the game to win

(Hook)
