[Intro: Kelly Rowland]
Go, go, go, go
Oh lover, don't you dare slow down
Go longer, you can last more rounds
Push harder, you're almost there now
So go lover, make mama proud

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
And when we're done, I don't wanna feel my legs
And when we're done, I just wanna feel your hands all over me, baby
But you can't stop there, music still playing in the background
And you're almost there
You can do it, I believe in you, baby
So close from here
Baby I'm a be your motivation

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Said that they was sisters it was keisha and amanda
One's a scorpio the other said she was a cancer
One's a bartender other says she was a dancer
Well I'm the general introduce me as the commander
What you gettin into I said nothing to substancial
We just asking you cause we thought you would give an answer
I'm like maybe baby but I think I need examples
That's what we tryin to do but you won't give us both a chance ta
One to take the handle, one to get it damper
Got to be official first you know I got to stamp ya
Come sit on my lap and get a present like I'm santa
She in all black and cobbin on the wood just like a panther
Damn girl

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Hold up mayne, she just sit back and watch her friend
Do her job then she switches
Feel like kamasutra she massage with deep kisses
My genie is a bottle she say I get 3 wishes
Well my first is get it wet then clean it up like deep dishes
Knowledge super wet you can call that brainstorming
Always tell me I'm the best I confess it's great scrotum
I ain't paying for no sex ya'll get played like beethoven
Call her up then she collect you call that pay phone and
I'm like what the hel you mean she ain't trippin if I choose her
Gotta lot of bread that's why always keep a toaster
Look at these two stripper poles that I got for ya
You and your girl can dance on em we can call that bi polar
Then she turned and asked me whatchu wiping off the desk for
Cause I'm your professor and tonight I'm bout to test ya
Ice in her mouth and a cup I left on the dresser
Brain freeze she turned me to the nutty professor
Tryin to keep composure sped up like a motor
Her friend behind that line I make em pick just like a voter
Told her take it slower knew that it was over
When she wrapped around it and she squeezed it like a cobra
Hold up toy soldier

[Verse 3: Kelly Rowland]
Baby I'm a be your motivation
Oh Lover
When you call my name
No other
Can do that the same
I won't let ya get up out of the game
No so go lover, gon and make me rain

[Chorus]
