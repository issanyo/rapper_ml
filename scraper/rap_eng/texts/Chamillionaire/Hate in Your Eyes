Jealousy In Ya Eyes (Thats What It Is Boy)
Envy In Ya Eyes (Thats What It Is Boy)

(Chorus)
You Can Love Me Or Hate Me

(Verse)
If You The Best, Beef Is Sumthin You Should Expect
Cause The Rest Be Feelin That To Be As Good As The Best
Its Obvious Im The Best So Im Lookin For Less
Of The Friends That Just Pretend Im Only Lookin For Checks
Say Hello To The Villan, I Would Say Its Nice To Meet You
But Its Not, So I Dont Pretend It Is When I Greet You
The Same Villan That Run With You Try To Beat You
So I Chase Money Like The Payment Thats On Ya Lease Due
Gimmie That (That) Gimmie Gimmie That (That)
Yeah That Is Why The Wallet Fatter Than A City Rat
Feelin That, Till Its Really Really Fat
You Hungry And Tryin To Eat Like ??? Give Ya Snacks
We Ain't Havin That, You Feelin Me? Yeah
They Dont Want Drama They Ain't Prepared
And Im Feelin They Scared
Go Tell Em I Said Ima Make A Killin This Year
Headed All The Way To The Top Like There Ain't A Celin In Here
(I Keep Goin Baby)

(Chorus)
You Can Love Me Or Hate Me
But Im Still Gonna Get My Money
Envy And Jealousy Is All I See
(Yeah) IIIIIIIIIIIII Can See The Hate In Ya Eyes
You Can Try But You Can't Stop Me
I Keep It Real I Keep It Street
So Tell Everybody That Dont Like Me
That IIIIIIIIIIII Can See The Hate In Ya Eyes

(Verse 2)
You Ain't Really Like The After Taste
So Im Back To Put The Music Business Back In Place
Lets Get Back Tryin To Crack Crack Crack The Safe
My Moneys Like My Liquor Tryin Sumthin I Dont Have To Waste

But I Do, Keep Sumthin That You Feelin Me? Yeah
Then Ima Keep Soon As They See Me Ain't Assuming A Thing
They Thought Id Fall Apart They Dont Really Like That After Taste
But I Come In Like "Gimmie That" And Snatch The Steaks
Can't See The Truth In Your Face You Must Be Blind, Deaf Too
Representin Texas Ima Rep It Till The Death Too
They Say Im Sick, When I Spit They Sayin Achoo
Cause This Type Of Cold Is The Cold They Wanna Catch Too
But Theres A Catch Too (Too) Because You Can't Win
Haters Hatin We Respond (Dont Get Mad Then)
We Headin Straight To The Bank We Bout To Cash In
Im In The Drivers Seat If Your Ridin Then Get Ass In

(Chorus)
You Can Love Me Or Hate Me
But Im Still Gonna Get My Money
Envy And Jealousy Is All I See
(Yeah) IIIIIIIIIIIII Can See The Hate In Ya Eyes
You Can Try But You Can't Stop Me
I Keep It Real I Keep It Street
So Tell Everybody That Dont Like Me
That IIIIIIIIIIII Can See The Hate In Ya Eyes

Jealousy, Jealousy I Can See Youre Jealous Of Me
But Keep Hatin Me (I See The Hate In Ya Eyes) But It Won't Stop Me
Let Em Hate

(Verse 3)
And Pay Attention To The Screen, It Ain't Shinnin Its Clean
They Could See As Soon As They See Me Ain't Assumin A Thing
Jewlery That You Say Is Mean Is PG-13
My Wrist Like A Horror Flick It Make The Cool Girl Scream
Tell Em To Calm Down The Pinky Rings The Preview
I Put Another Set Around My Neck To Be The Sequel
So Mean That Moneys The Reson People Turn Evil
So I Get Checks You Upset Soon As I Leave You
But Be True, If You Feel What Im Doin Is Wrong
But Its Better To Be That Gimmie Gimmie That
Its Better To Stack Big Wads Then Get Coins
So I Chase Money Myself And Won't Let You Join

(Chorus)
You Can Love Me Or Hate Me
But Im Still Gonna Get My Money
Envy And Jealousy Is All I See
(Yeah) IIIIIIIIIIIII Can See The Hate In Ya Eyes
You Can Try But You Can't Stop Me
I Keep It Real I Keep It Street
So Tell Everybody That Dont Like Me
That IIIIIIIIIIII Can See The Hate In Ya Eyes
