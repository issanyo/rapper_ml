(Verse 1: Chamillionaire)
Oh Yeah!
I Done Came Down Sideways, Sideways, Sideways
I Done Came Down Sideways, Whats Today, Friday
Well Last Week I spent about a hundred thou
But I'ma make it back in bout five days
Talking Money I talk fluent
When i'm in your city
I'm broad choosing
Got cheerleaders like Mark Cuban
How ironic they all Cubans, ha
What yall doing
Tryin to act like yall have a clue
Diamonds are a girls best friend
Well I'ma have her holding my family jewels
Laying back with your cute angel
My steering wheel wood I do strangle
My trunk is at an obtuse angle
Don't playa hate cuz I'll Lui Kang you
You can see that I'm choppin boys
I ain't got to bring out the porsche
Chuch chuch chuch, oh yeah
Swangas making that choppin noise
Super fine, then i'm intercepting
If she super fake
Then she can get to steppin
If she super thick
The she can be debbie deb and
Come to the state and leave with a Texan


(Chorus 1: Chamillionaire)
Girl I know I know you really want somebody
Thats gone rep that Texas just like we do, just like we do
You know thats the reason why the vogues so shiny, so shiny
Oooh I got to confess
No one can contest
And everytime we do what we do
It's way better than sex
Thats why I'm slowing it up
I'm normally so in a rush
In the club throwing it up
A little dough ain't enough
Thats why I think i'm in love
That right I think i'm in love
I said I think I'm in love....mhmmm with the change!!


(Verse 2: Chamillionaire)
I done came down sideways
Gotta hold it down for my entire state
I got rims thats under that candy door
That makes T-McGrady look 5'8
See adapters make the whole ride shake
But then my mattress make your hoe vibrate
Got a bunch a cash under my mattress 
I gotta wrap it up in black wire tape
They ain't shopping
They ain't copping
They ain't watching
No swangs chopping
They just watching us do our thing
Then they get to boppin and name dropping
Your woman loving my whips and cream
My boxers made of that same topping
When I'm done, she gone top me off
I guess you can call that brain washing
Rims and the wood like Griffin Blake
If you a baller you can participate
But in Texas we ain't down with the fakes
So if you fake, you should just skip the state
If you fake you can go get a hook from Drake
Get a verse from Em, get a hook from Jay
Get a beat from Dre and Kanye today
And still couldn't leave with no fan base

(Chorus 2 Chamillionaire)
Girl I know I know you really want somebody
Thats gone rep that Texas just like we do, just like we do
You know thats the reason why the vogues so shiny, so shiny
Oooh  I got to confess, no one can contest
And everytime we do what we do, it's way better than sex
I done came down sideways, and it feels good
I think I'm in love
I said I think I'm in Love
I said I think I'm in Lo-o-ove
I think I'm in love..........mhmmm with the change!!
