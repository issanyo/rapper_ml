(*talking*)
Uh ha-ha, Play-N-Skillz
Big Tuck, Chamillionaire hey let's go

[Hook - 2x]
Haters we ain't scared of them, in the club we punish them
Promise we don't play with them, grab that thang and aim at them
Real throw your knuckles up, represent throw your cities up
Niggas hating rough 'em up, represent throw it up

[Chamillionaire]
Chamillionaire till you see it, hey (don't forget the K)
Niggas getting in the way, hey don't forget the K
I don't need to bring the K, I'm ready to knuckle up
Drop a beat down on him, like I'm Skillz and the Play
(got skills I don't play), I'ma hit him with the knuckle game
And then Rasaq, gonna hit him with another swang
The whole click, gonna hit him with another (bang)
Feeling dizzy, he can't remember his mother's name
(let me wake you up), let me refresh your memory
I can be your worst friend, or your bestest enemy
Please tell him what he's guilty of ref, (a penalty)
Get hit so hard, you would think it's ten of me
(but what's the deal), my nigga hol' up
We fin to po' up, another cold cup
Is you ready to sell, (my nigga sho' nuff)
Cause D-Town to H-Town, got it (sowed up)
Go on throw up your hood, and I'ma know you real
Nigga show him your slug, (nigga show him your grill)
Them niggas ain't looking for trouble, over here
And I'm not Big Tuck, but so I'm so (for real)
If you blowing kill, but you know you trill
And you see the laws pull up, but you blowing still
(And they see your pinky ring), when you hold your wheel
Roll the window up on em, and go g'yeah-g'yeah

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Tuck]
This what we gotta do, dismantle you and your whole crew promise you
Stirring up beef like stew bitch nigga you, fuck what you going through
You'd think you in a zoo, how these bats and gorillas rush you
Stinking like jelly fish do, why whip one whip two
And I'ma hocus and beat you like Peru, we don't need clues where is my tools
Abric Diesel pants, matching my shoes
You niggas know, that we're not here to lose
I'm finna send my hollow tips, trying to bruise
Whoa ride to the island of youth, fuck it choke him till he blue
Subtract two Cardier for your crew, doctors have work to do
Fuck it throw your cups up, you got money throw your bucks up
We done opened doors, we get them hoes up
Bout them bitches, throw your skirts up
Niggas shine like a laser show, still counting money from two days ago
Bar tender get very violent mo', what kinda tracks everybody know

[Hook - 2x]

[Chamillionaire]
I don't mean, to interrupt
I'ma pass it to the Tuck, we gon po' another cup
We gon get a lot of hoes, we gon load 'em in the truck
Take 'em to the hotel, like what's up-what's up
Trying to deal with it, you gon have no luck
My patience get low, when my grands go up
No money up front, you gon have no us
We gon burn off the lot, like man hol' up
Cause I'm not a lame, I got the game
I start the swangs, hop out the lane
If you cock the thang, you better pop the thang
Or I'll knock your brain, up out your frame
Ain't real, them boys ain't true
Stick a fork in him, cause that boy there through
Don't worry bout that boy, if that boy ain't you
He a thing of the past, what that boy name

[Big Tuck]
Fuck it, po' it up then
Said what's up, let me see what click you in
You a bad bitch, let me see some skin
Pass then, pass then
Keep it popping, till the sun begin
Then find us a hotel, to check up in
Jacuzzi suite, room 20-10
Come on in, I see you brought your friend

[Chamillionaire]
Them boys, don't do it big as us
Them boys, ain't even real as us
But them boys over there, grilling us
So all my real niggas, let's knuckle up
None of them niggas, as true as us
Ain't nothing, they can do do us
What y'all niggas wanna do, what's up
They ain't ready, for Chamillionaire and Tuck

What it is (what's up, what's up)
