[Intro]
I'mma thank you, when and what the album almost through
Thanks, I ain't never had a fan like you
Eazy E, Left Eye and Aaliyah too
Pac, Biggie, Hawk, Fat Pat and DJ Screw
I wanna thank you

Thanks for opening my eyes and helping me to realize
That tomorrow ain't promised, Gotta live your life to the fullest
What's life if you ain't enjoying it, Know what I'm talking bout?

[Verse]
My purpose really used to be so unclear
Science fiction with the swagger, it's so unreal
So fly that my nickname should be up here
Looking up is the only time when I appear
I'm a spartan, go ahead and throw your spear
Slap failure in the face and still show no fear
They say no show but I show like chea
The Champ's here, let the whole crowd know my cheer (Victory!)
The media, they write about you in the mask
Spread rumors about your life and break you is the task
I know one of my three publicists will ruin my chance
So let me let you know that I don't like you in advance
But I thank you and I extend their thanks too
To everybody saying stuff you know ain't true
You need to go and find god like Mase too
But just stay there with him and try and stay you
Getting away is important
I can pull a couple strings like a guitar hand
Better yet, bring out the whole guitar band
Grab green, we can swing somewhere like Tarzan
I swear to y'all, the rap game really making me sick
The record industry's your home then I came to prevent
Put some nonsense out and I bet ya this one will stick
Or put some real music out and I'm probably gonna catch a brick
Brick on top of brick, we'll build a house
To whoever said that I'm still filled with doubt
Told me I'm in the right hole and then sealed it out
Told me I'm on the right track and then killed my route
Ouch, you never miss a good thing til it's gone
Yeah, the flow is so fluid, it's like drinking a song
Don't get the track listing wrong, this ain't even a song
This is a beat that I must release therapy on
Everybody saying that they wanna see me successful
Came into the game but now I'm feeling let's go
Intimate moments never seem to be special
See the jet, you can bet I'm disappearing like presto
Alakazaam, I ain't mad at the fans
I ain't mad at the man they both scattered my brand
Never will understand what really matters to Cham
So matter of fact, the title is just a matter of plan (Victory!)
After revenge, it's the victory right
Well the final run's done and this the victory hype
Now that everybody's present and this victory night
Let me repaint the pic, they wasn't depicting me right
(Now what you mean?) Tell the world that I'm more than just a grill
Show you how to put ya hands on more than a wood wheel
If that's all you hearing, then let me just be for real
Take your contract, the hell with a record deal
Keep thinking I'm gonna lose if you want to
Been through ten times in life more than you gone through
That's why I always have to make the move on fools
Back on my feet like I got two gun shoes
Yeah, why you think Em probably going all crazy?
So why you think Britney Spears going bald baby?
Interview me, you think you know it all lady
I'm out of here, yeah but not before y'all pay me
Thank you

[Outro]
I appreciate it
You know I'm gonna use the power of respect and a million dollar check to do what I wanna do
And right now, I feel to take a vacation
A real vacation though, Haha)
This the outro, was gonna put it at the beginning
But this is what I say the moment after I'm winning

Thank you, Ultimate Victory
