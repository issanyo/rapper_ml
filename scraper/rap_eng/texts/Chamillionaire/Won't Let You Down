[Intro]
It seems that there's a deadly virus that's sweeping through the urban community
The side effects cannot often be seen because your pockets will not turn green
Some thought that there was no vaccine, But it seems that we have a cure
Chamillitary Mayne
Get off your couch and go get it

[Hook - sung]
I'm up early in the morning thinking bout getting this money
All I know is I gotta get that paper
The hustlers told me that I gotta get it, get it
Now I'm gettin it the best way I know how
I won't let you down, won't let you down {*4X*}
I won't let you down

[Chamillionaire]
I'm up early than a mother, chasing mine cause I'm a hustler
Then tomorrow everything is gonna rewind
Only seven days a week and 24 hours a day
That ain't enough for me so I ain't wasting time
Cause only dreams come to sleepers and my life ain't getting cheaper
So you know them dollar signs, they on my mind
When they ask me where I'm goin? I say you already know
I'm bout to hit the streets and go and get what's mine, I won't let you down
Dreams of having finer things, Ridin blades and dreaming should
Make you wanna wake up and get it in real life than see the wood
In your grip, If you slip and don't grab what you see then good
Only place that you gonna be or ever see gonna be the hood

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
Poor that word ain't no excuse, You know what it mean to me
It means you passing over opportunities repeatedly
Write it on a piece of paper, Only thing I see is P
That paper, paper, paper chaser, better thing for me to be
Nah, my services ain't for free, make that money multiply
Early in the morning I be gone, chase with me, it ain't gonna be no tie
Try to explain and give em game, I don't know why I even try
You do the same if you was I, but you are you so you gonna lie
Make em think that you got cash, tell them ladies you got slabs
Only thing you get is laughs, You can't even bring down half
Of the bill that's on that tab, Only thing wrong with being broke
Is staying broke and making excuses bout it like there ain't no hope

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
I don't know how many times I gotta tell ya
In the hood, having no condition, I was having something
I remember it like it was yesterday
They was talking down on me and I lost a couple homies
I was getting mine while they used to play
They say I need to slow down but I ain't slowing down for nothing
I don't wanna let the paper get away
So when I'm in the streets grindin, ain't no need to be crying
The best way that you can help me is to pray I won't let you down
Partners that was getting lazy, Females that was acting crazy
Then promoters that tried to play me, Mixtape labels that didn't pay me
My old homies that ain't around me, Dissing rappers that came to find me
Major labels that didn't sign me, left all that nonsense behind me, I got paid

[Hook]

[Outro]
See, rich people ain't going to tell you how to get paid
And broke people act like they the richest people in the world
Always tellin people with money how to get money
Always spendin money that they thought they was gonna get
Always buying things they can't afford
Stop making excuses
If chronic smoke makes him sleepy, he's gonna tell ya he got chronic fatigue
If liquor makes him drowsy, he gonna say he got that grey goose disease
If women keep taking his money, he gonna tell ya he slipped off his sleeve
Whatever your weakness, stop making excuses please
You should not be in couch or in house, you should be in route
If you gotta ask where, then that's the reason you ain't got nothing
You don't know how to listen, go get it
