[Intro:]
Ya feel me
If I tell ya a duck can pull a truck, you shut up and hook the truck up
This is my world you just a squirrel, ya knahsayin?
Chamilly, baby
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha...
WOO!

Venom on the way
Nomtombout?

Screw-shop-dot-com
Chamillionaire-dot-com (huh)
Ay man, I make this look beautiful
That's the difference between me and y'all, nomtombout? (PREACH!)
Real easy real light way, real quick, let's go (WOO)

[Verse 1:]
I already know the world is cold they try'na put me in the snow
Complaining they ain't goin keep me warm, that's what I keep that heater for
Every word is signing deeper it ain't screwed or even slow
Com-meaning it's for you to go and figure out at me to know
Ben and Franklin got me thinking I be try'na fold them guys
Had my necklace super icy let my necklace polarized
Just be careful try'na take cause that's goin be your dimmize
Now it's all eyes on me and I don't even know no spies
When they ask me what I do I say that I'm a lumberjack
See my hand gripping on something my wood wheel up under that
Man your girl is on the sac, like they do a running-back
She just keep on coming back so I'm a call her thunder cat
Thunder cat, whole other rappers they just kinda throwed
I be super throwed like a football with no autobulls
She show you no brain, what the heck you pay her college for?
Used to be Pimp Mode now I'm hopping in deposit mode

[DJ Scratching over one line of Hook]
Pull up on the scene and looking super clean (TOSIN)
And I'm looking super clean (okay) I hope that she ain't chose
Girl, I be getting green, yeah I be getting green (okay)
Just check my pinky ring you are just a squirrel in my world
Okay (hey-hey) okay (hey-heeyy) okay
I really hope that ain't ya girl, man
Okay (hey-hey) okay (hey-heeyy) okay
I really hope that ain't ya girl, man

[Verse 2:]
HA!
Ladies said I'm mean, I looked at her and said "What'cha mean? "
Money ain't a thing, money's nice and I'm like "What is mean? "
Brag about my bling, hater please don't try to cause a scene
I pull out that thang just be careful this goin cause a sting
Money drive me cra-zay yeah I'm a money maniac
But I just go cra-zay when you not try'na pay me that
Get head from yo lad-day yeah she made me a brainiac
Vechile is wait-ing yeah you can have your lady back
I'm in my lac, yep I'm strapped and I ain't talking about no condom
Try'na protect that naked lady and I ain't talking about no one's
Got Universal Mind Control and I ain't talking about no Common
When they see me riding fo's, ya girl be coming when I (?)sommon?
They can't even talk, either words like they ain't got no speech
My trunk best stuck up and then they went down since that Capple Beach
Looking for the freaks, think again them freaks looking for me
Mixtape never sees, it's Chamilly trick I run the streets

[Hook:]
Pull up on the scene and looking super clean
And I'm looking super clean (okay) I hope that she ain't chose
Girl, I be getting green, yeah I be getting green (okay)
Just check my pinky ring you are just a squirrel in my world
Okay (hey-hey) okay (hey-heeyy) okay
I really hope that ain't ya girl, man
Okay (hey-hey) okay (hey-heeyy) okay
I really hope that ain't ya girl, man
