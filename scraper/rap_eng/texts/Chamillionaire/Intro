[Talking]
The south has influenced every form of music you can think of
So it's only natural when you give us this hip-hop
We gon' look at it and say "aww yeah, we down with it"
Lemme show you where we can take it

[Chamillionaire]
Yeah, you know what it is
It's Chamillionaire and DJ Ideal
And if you don't know what it is we finna make y'all get it right
We world wide baby
Signed a multi million dollar deal with Universal and I'm ready to get 'em!
Ideal, you ready?

[Lil Jon sample/adlib]
Let's goooooo
The bottom bitch!

[T.I. talking]
Know your folk be staying down on the road man
Rollin' all the way from Florida MIA, all the way to the [?]
All the way up to Tennessee
A lot of the real niggas be showing love, you know what I'm saying?
I really appreciate that
All the dope boys be coming out, all the home girls be showing love
But, a lot of folks man they still be lookin' like they don't know who I'm is
Ayy tell 'em
Who I'm is?

[Samples/adlibs from different songs]
DJ Ideal
Miamis mixtape prince, coming up

The prince and I ain't takin' no junk
I'm a quiet crunk nigga and fuck bein' a punk

[Chamillionaire]

Aye bring it back and show 'em what time it is

[Samples/adlibs from different songs]
