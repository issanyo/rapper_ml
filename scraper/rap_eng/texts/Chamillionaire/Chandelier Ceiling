Candy coated bendin' corners fif-fifth [6x]
Made a killin off of, off of grills and chandelier ceiling[2x]

[Verse 1]
Now let me roll my sleeve up
While you get your g's up
I'm a boss I cut you off if I think you a skeamer
Had to get my team up
And had to get my cream up
Plus the Wu had told you that cash rule everything huh
And for them Kathrina now we don't wait for fema
We get back up on our feet and slab a candy beama
I can be no dreamer and plus my girl a diva
Keep her happy and that nappy wet as aquafina
I'm start ya from the cleaners and plus I'm gripping real wood
We repped that before pimp died and I feel like we still should
Show em how the grill look them swangers on the wheel should
Get the chips then purchase whips ,because it make me feel good
I be like..

[Verse 2]
I got some good advice for ya if they get a mic for ya
Make it for these boys who drop the syrup in the sprite soda
Screwed up Southern type flow-ers
Say that he a dice roller
Just be careful this ain't something you
Should bet your life over
Hope the lizard geico ya
Cuz u better be insured
You gonna come to Texas with that then
You better be for sure
You should hit that kitty pur
No this Jag is not for her
You can even see the piece
Thats right my chest look like a blur
Let these critics chopped in
Got my weapon cocked in
It's not even in the spot I'm supposed to have it locked in
Caddy that im dropping make you erase your top 10
Thats it if we talking cars or broads
Whatever, I got options
I'm in my....

[Verse 3]
Wanna be a baller
Shot caller
20 inch blades on a Impala
That's how we ride
Soutside we roll on choppers
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
25 lighters on my dresser
Southside South side man
Talkin bout diamonds in your face
Now what the hell you meaning trick?
Texas too legit
Plus I got my hammer case a jacker
Wanna trip
Leaning on a switch
Seated on the stitch
Hit that waffle house you completed with the grits
Yella think she slick
Got a be that magnum
Horses under the hood or maybe on the range like Jazzy an them
Snitches just be tadelin
Mad because we slabbin em
When you super cold it ain't nothing you
Can add to them
I be rolling...
