[Hook - Chamillionaire]
Heeey, I'm livin good, couldn't be better
Grippin wood, on the leather
Lettin 'em look at my bezzle (at my bezzle)
I got my diamonds exposed
I'm a shine and I'm a glow
Got my diamonds exposed
I'm a shine and I'm a glow
Y'all know I'm in the hood gettin cheddar
Floatin just like a feather
Sittin up on propellers
Heeey, I got my diamonds exposed
I'm a shine and I'm a glow
Got my diamonds exposed
I'm a shine and I'm a glow
Y'all know I got to flo-ss

[Break - Chamillionaire - talking]
Hold up man, I know I was supposed to drop this Mixtape Messiah 4 a long time ago
But ah, honestly after Pimp passed, I really didn't feel like putting it out
I was kind of chilling, on the whole music thing
A lot of people was asking me where I was at
And where I've been, what I've been up to
But really, if you listened to the album, +Ultimate Victory+, my last, sophomore album
Then you will see, that at the end of it
I told you ahead of time, what I was going to do
I was going to take a little vacation because
I've been like grinding on this mixtape thing since 1998
Never took no break, working hard man
You could see the stress on my face
Just always dealing with rap, every single day man
I had to take some time away from it man
Just to get my thoughts together, come back and be right, you know?
But I got a new album coming fourth quarter
Ah, the name is "to be announced"
Stay tuned to chamillionaire.com, I'll give you all the information man
We back on, we ready to get it, know what I'm talking about?
And ah, honestly man, even though I'm messing with boys from Texas
After the +Won't Let You Down+ song
I felt like I wasn't going to mess with nobody from Texas
And I'm a say that because I tried to get everybody on the song cleared
And I couldn't get nobody cleared
Well almost nobody, I got Pimp cleared
R.I.P. to him, he passed away
But he was cleared on the record
And I was a little bit upset because I feel like that record could have went a lot further than it did
Like there was actually no video for that record
I never got another video, because I couldn't get my "peers," cleared
Wow!
I ain't trying to point the fingers at nobody
I'm just saying man, as fans y'all need to put the pressure on everybody in Texas to come with it
Because I'm a come with it
I know y'all be hitting me on every website I got, telling me I need to step it up
So you need to do the same with everybody else man
You know what I'm saying?
We ain't nothing without y'all

Yeah, I'm getting my Mike Jones on right now
I mean there's so much that I could say
But I ain't really want to talk y'all ear off
On this CD, cause that's what I do and then they start say I'm preaching
And you know how that go
But I'm a give y'all a lot of information on chamillionaire.com man
Y'all log on, I'll let you know what the business is

[Hook - Chamillionaire]
Heeey, I'm livin good, couldn't be better
Grippin wood, on the leather
Lettin 'em look at my bezzle (at my bezzle)
I got my diamonds exposed ('sposed, 'sposed)
Feelin good, crawlin slow
I got my diamonds exposed ('sposed, 'sposed)
Feelin good, crawlin slow
Y'all know I'm in the hood gettin cheddar
Floatin just like a feather
Sittin up on propellers
Heeey, I got my diamonds exposed ('sposed, 'sposed)
Feelin good, crawlin slow
