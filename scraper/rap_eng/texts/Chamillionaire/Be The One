[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
I wanna be the one to work it till your (back out)

Everybody asking when I'm coming (back out)
When I finish given all your women (backshots)
I'm a mack I wanna be the one to work it till you (back out)
You can't quit ya know I ain't gon let ya (back out)
Everybody asking when I'm coming back out
When I finish given all your women (backshots)
I wanna be the one to work it till your back out
Ya can't quit ya know I ain't gon let ya back out
Everybody asking when I'm coming back out
When I finish given all your women backshots
I'm a mack without the apple on the laptop
You know that I'm a run it back until ya pass out
I'm a have the lizard logo as the back drop
I'm a let the big faces be the mascot
Whole bunch of money, whole bunch of johnny
That's a whole bunch of jewellery hanging low to my tummy
On vogues and it's sunny, head home witcha hunny
I'm a make her sweat it out until her nose getting runny
Hacoo, that new, fresh set of tatoos
I'm feeling on your body baby that's smooth
Tell your ex boyfriend I'm that dude
That il black both of his eyes like a raccoons
Tip down when I floss
Missin pimp wipe the chick when I talk
Lil nobodies talk down on the boss
But I got more change than ya'll in my couch
Ouch, if the shoe fits then it gotta hurt
I be killing everything pull up in a hearse
I be healing all the pain let me go to work
I'm the mixtape god tabanacle church

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Girl I wanna be the one, be be be the one
Girl I wanna be the one
Be the one to kiss you goodnight
Be the one, be be be be the one
Girl I wanna be the one, be the one
Girl I wanna be the one, be be be the one
Girl I wanna be the one, be the one to kiss you goodnight
Be the one, be be be the one, girl I wanna be the one
Be the one to kiss you goodnight

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
A lil sunshine open my eyes
Wake up in the morning, she on my mind
Get fresh, get dressed
The world, it's my time
So you can think about your soul
[?] cause you know we on
So let me turn off that phone
We ain't gotta stop we grown
And I don't really give a fuck who's calling
I don't really give a fuck who's ballin'
Call me A. Keys, who's Fallin'
You's fallin', that's dude's problem
So hop in this thang
Forget what he said
Wanna taste my favourite spread
My lips between your legs

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
I'm headed over there
You better be prepared
Pullin' on ya hair
No kiddin', no trippin'
My dog and yo kitten
My head in yo mitten
If you take it than I'm gon' give it
If you throw it, then I'm gon hit it
I'm ain't gon miss it, it's my mission I'm a kiss on every lip of yours
What now, touch down, your body like a score
Get it, I'm a get it like you never did before

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Young Jeezy]
Look, Lloyd got me on these dutch masters
So all you see is these dutch rappers
Coconut kush, cocnut ciroc
Not behind the wheel, coconut the top
Get it? yeah I said nothing
Talk back to her, like what
Ain't nothing sweet in my sweet
See I start off slow, go deep
Got an uptown?, it's over
I told ya, she my soldier
Yeh, Young be the boss
Everyday of the week I floss
Look off white rocks, no denim
Look off white drop, no rental
Yeah, top down in the winter
Say I ball too hard, Sportscenter
I'm in the club with my ice out
Start blowing up my iPhone
Like where ya at? where ya been?
What ya doing tonight, can you hit it again
From the back, while I'm on the scene
While you smoking blunts while ya drinking drinks
While ya other broads blowing up ya phone
While ya pulling my hair with ya Nike's on

[Chorus]
