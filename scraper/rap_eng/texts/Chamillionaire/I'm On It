[Intro - Chamillionaire - talking]
Haha, you never seen somebody hop out the grave
I mean like, straight out the dirt
Ha, something crazy
Yeah!
Woo!

[Hook - Chamillionaire] - w/ ad libs
Hustle all night, hustle all day
I'm about to lose my mind tryin to get my life straight
I be workin all night, workin all day
I'm a always be on time when my money call me
I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it
I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on the way
I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it
I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on the way

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
You know what my name is but you could call me Cashis (why?)
Every time you see my name, you know that's where the cash is (okay)
Who sold his soul to the Devil? My homie from the past did
But he still broke cause the check bounce soon as he tried to cash it (woo!)
Ashes to ashes, it's dusty in my casket
They said Texas was dead but tell the Grim Reaper "I'm back trick!"
Money is like "Venom" but I'm addicted to the madness
If money was made of poison ivy, I'd deal with the rashes
Dear all of my haters, I can't help that you not great as me
Smart is how I sound cause I got grounded when I made a C
Employee I just gave a G, want every letter from A to Z
Prominently just payin you so you could work at payin me (woo!)

[Hook] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
You know what my name is but you could call me "Boss Man"
Buy the building where you work so you could be like "ah, damn"
Y'all ain't about no green so I don't hang around with y'all man
But if you got some green then I be hangin like I'm Tarzan
Now your woman is a groupie, followin my tour van
I'm the reason that she open like a greasy door jam
Problems I be havin are the type you get from flossin
With a Oreo is chick that's yellower than Bart's tan (doh!)
I'm tryin to eat meal good, I don't want no portions
You compare what I get up to yours, it should be more than
Gasoline on your shoes if you come up short man
I be right on your Trail, Blazin it like Portland (woo!)

[Hook] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire]
She know what my name is but act like I'm a windmill
Think I'm blowin my money away and she gon' win mills
Get real (get real), don't be silly, yeah you're pretty but still (but still)
Nothin move but the money, sit your pretty butt still (sit your pretty butt still)
Put some money in your pocket, then it better get some mileage
If you makin dirty money, better treat it like it's polished
Cause one day when you ain't got it and your foreign ain't exotic
Haha, forget about it, look how your career is rotted
Fresh and fruity corporate people tellin ya what you have to be
That's the reason that the game is fruity as a apple seed (hey!)
Do it just like Master P, just get all your cash and leave
Y'all know where I'm a be, the next time that ya ask for me

[Hook] - w/ ad libs

[Outro - Chamillionaire - talking]
