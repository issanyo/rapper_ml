Listen To My Thesis, See Just What I Mean
Nigga I Ride Dirty Everyday But Still I Shine So Clean

[Talking through hook: Chamillionaire]
This underground rap royalty right here mayn
It's Koopa
Let's go ahead and talk it down, Ke
Pop the trunk mayne
Know what I'm talkin bout?

[Verse: Lil Keke]
Glitter and glean got a hustla feeling guilty
Kush smoked up burner cause a nigga riding filthy
Ball if it kill me, life inside the turning lane
Finished for this coming down holding on this wood grain
Married to this thug thang, I be at it real early
Shining like a spotlight even though I'm riding dirty
Tell it to a G, if you know the playa better wait
Dirty south Houston, Texas niggas do it everyday
Legendary Yung Don steal knocking pimpin fun
Phantom with a lambchop, call them hoes Reverend Run
Flipping like an acrobat, TV like an apple mat
Fo-fifteens inside the back, ask him is they liking that
This is called a Cadillac keep me saying "Thank ya"
Old school Americans are keepin like my gangsta
Keke rolling hard on to ya slabs got the yard bigger
Coming down clean still swangin on fraud niggas

[Verse: Chamillionaire]
They stand around staring at my whip like it's some kind of statue
But if you touch it you'll get hurt just like you got a tattoo Why? Cause I'm a slap you
They gone get sick my whip gone make em "Ah-choo!"
In the yella Vet so wet it'll make you wanna go buy a Snapple
That's pineapple
I didn't have to even get my bling
But I'm a rock it like the Dream, but don't call me Hakeem
When I'm coming down that candy green look like Listerine
My appraisal took a month because I got a list of rings
Forgive my bling
Ballin got me feeling like Tila baby
My fleet is crazy, but the chick that's in my seat is lazy
She won't get up
Yup, my Lincoln is my sweet lil lady
It's like the sun is try'na bake her like Anita baby
I need a shady spot where I can park a fleet of cars
I ain't gone lie ran out of room in my complete garage
Get a massage for my 15s doing a stanky leg
That stanky bread, dirty money watch me make a left
And shake a fed like
