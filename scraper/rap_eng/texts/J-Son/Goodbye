Got it this time uhuh
No lie, I'm in a fruitful place
But I was here thinking about you today
My heart finna lose the same gon' moved away
Can't wait till I return
Wuddup gate the church
For now my roots are being planted deep in the dirt
Dirt so I'm reminded of purpose again
I'd better serve you if I'm a better servant of him
So to all my brothers and sisters
No, not a day goes by that I'm not reminded I miss you
The city's the only thing I've known
See the look on his face
When I tell my brother I'm really gone
Tears rolling down our face
Hugging like I'm never leaving but knowing I got a gift
And the more that I think about it, the tighter becomes the grip
The brother standing around is the love this feeling astounding
Too many names to mention but you're the reason I'm grounded yea
And I know it's strange
But I know His aim's
To glorify His holy name as I go through these growing pains

Man, leaving St. Louis has been
One of the most difficult things I've had to do
To leave the city I love
The people I love
But I gotta follow the god I love

Goodbye
Ever had to say that to everything you know
Cause in your spirit you're feeling the lord telling you go go woah
Smell it?
Fear seeping through my pores second guessing he said it
Send me a sign
Is it your voice?
I really can't tell
Is it my connection?
My signal keeps sending me fail
Failure yea led by the spirit into to the wilderness he painted on me
You ain't hearing
Tears coming down my wifey's eyes
We got no friends and I'm
Feeling like nothing I can do to dry those cries
Got it all wrong this time
Feeling so tired
Feeling like why I'm following you?
She's following me
What we gonna do?
What's it gonna be?
She done left all of her family
And she's fighting although she's hurting
I know that you're truly with us
Spirit is truly working producing something within us yea
No this ain't strange 'cause I know your aim's
To glorify your holy name as we go through these growing pains
For me my wife and my family to be stripped away from everything we've known
It's been hard
But we're testaments to the fact that god brings growth
Through our pains
