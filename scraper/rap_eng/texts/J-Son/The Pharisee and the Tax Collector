(based on Luke 18:9-14)

[Verse 1: Phanatik, as “the Pharisee”]
I’m just a man but I stand before you Lord, Your standards are so pure
But I’m sure you’ve gotta hand it to your boy
Cause as I draw nearer to the mirror of your law
I’m in awe cause now I see myself clearer, like where’s the flaws
I’m mean I got flaws in me to an extent
But not as many flaws as some, hint hint
What’s with this fellow here bellowing prayers
Melancholy mellow with his head low in tears
Yeah he’s probably gotta be a real sinner unlike one like such as I
I trust this guy won’t be justified
By his works, look at him lookin’ like it hurts to repent
Since when was pain part of penitence
Nah that ain’t true, God I thank you
You made me just a little lower than the angels
So I know you must be pleased with my life they say that Jesus is Christ
But who needs him when my deeds are so righteous

[Interlude: J’Son]
Now this man seems to be confident in his works but
Under the surface we’ll see what he has truly worked up
So for the Pharisee we’ll say its fair to see apparently
He hasn’t seen the dirt that he had worked up but
The mirrors there to behold the man
He sees a broken mirror not a broken man
No hope in the Lamb
The hopes in his hands and so
Does he meet the standard we know the answers “NO!”

[Verse 2: timothy brindle, as “the Tax Collector”]
God! I’ve come to Your temple, abundantly sinful
So Your Judgment is kindled: Your Wrath’s displeasure
But I hear Your Love can extend to rugged and simple men
Cuz Your Son He was sent for: Tax Collectors
Sin’s defiled my soul, feels insurmountable
But Your abundant grace is bountiful
I should be crushed and die, and thrust aside for my folly
But I trust inside, You justify the ungodly (Rom. 4:5)
That’s what I am, an evil wretch/ so I beat my chest
Yet the only thing pleasing You is Jesus’ death
On my knees I admit this, I’m the chief of all sinners
I’m grieved, cuz even my best deeds, they are wicked
So I seek Your forgiveness, that Jesus can give us
Since His bleeding is finished, You said He is Sufficient
I’m a sinner who is cursed completely
So my only hope is that You’ll “mercy-seat” me!

[Interlude: J’Son]
But the other man known as a thief and crook
Refused to even lift his head to the heavens and look
He recognizes he can’t offer the deeds he has done
To a holy God who would only just see them as dung
So he beats his chest and cries for mercy (Father!)
Lord I’m a sinner no I’m not worthy
So I tell you that this man will be seen as JUST
Cause instead of his deeds he looked to Yahweh to place his trust! (Yes!)
