[Chorus – Pastor AD3]
You are not a goon
That's not why he created you
He made you for his glory
In his image and his likeness

[Verse 1 – Json]
Streets they shaped me raised me made me all about the fetty dough
Toast I kept it close you never know when I’ma let it go
Look me in my eyes got the kush to the fire
Ratchet on my side down to push, I’m a rider
This is all I know, do whatever for the cake
Keep the fitty pulled low, you’ll tell a felon by his face
My dream was movin’ weight, thinkin’ money over anything
Dickies and some Dopemans before they rocked them skinny jeans
Henny in my cup, thinking what, livin’ life man as fast as a race
At sixteen my homie Gaylon lost half of his face
Boyd had your boy gone, ill from whippin’ big
Had to support the habit, now I’m a stick up kid
Wasn’t young and unashamed, I’d rather die in the game
A little fortune and fame, the streets remember my name, hey
All that I’m sayin’ I done been in ya shoes
And in ya tomb now i’m yellin’ at dudes …

[Chorus – Pastor AD3]
You are not a goon
That’s not why he created you
He made you for his glory
In his image and his likeness
Lil homie I was you
Grindin’ for that change and fame that made me
Posted with that thang that bang to save me
Till Christ came and man he changed me
No homie you are not a goon

[Verse 2 – Thi'sl]
I hit the block at 16 in a Cut Supreme
My only dream, to put a brick up on a triple beam
So I hit the hood hard, tryna get the cream
My mindset’s to get more paper then I’ve ever seen
I told the homie fast we bout to make it boom
The hood made me crazy, full-blooded goon
My back against the wall, I didn’t know what to do
Thought I was really winnin’, but I was ‘bout to lose
(Fast forward) Learned I was made for worship, that I was made with purpose
Thought I was livin’ but I hadn’t even scratched the surface
Learned I was made in his image, that’s what it do
That’s why I’m here talking to you, lil homie you are not a goon

[Chorus – Pastor AD3]

[Verse 3 – Json]
God made you in his image, not here to follow men
OGs they may have raised you, but he made you to model him
Your heart beats for the streets, homie I feel your grind
God’s heart beats for the street, his son lived and died
Would rise to give you peace, so why ride with the streets?
Live your life as a goon, die and face God who’s a beast
We rep God over beats, hope the hood get it soon
He knew you from the womb to the tomb You weren’t made to be a goon

[Chorus – Pastor AD3]
No homie you are not a goon ...

No homie you are not a goon ...

No homie you are not a goon ...

No homie you are not a goon
