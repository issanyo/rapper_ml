[Intro: Of Methodist]
Wish we knew the things we’re fighting for
Wish we were the way we were before
Down the line will we be something more
Or will you be the one i had adored

[Verse 1: Axel Brizzy]
“Love better, listen more”
True, those words we ignored
Bit our backs, can’t bring us back
Now our souls coexist with our feelings on the floor

So, that’s what you really want
Just us two? No witness for hit and run
Even though you wield the gun
Swear i’m by your side no matter what weather comes

So you can’t find a love that’s oh so divine
But when you drown in love, it also divides
You’ll feel so alive, thru all odds, defy
Then most nights you cry, just planning that ‘goodbye’ yeah

Pleading for your patience
We going thru the phases, can’t let it faze us
Your heart’s aching, yeah mine too
Stay the night, we’ll be done by noon


[Chorus: Of Methodist]
Wish we knew the things we’re fighting for
Wish we knew the way we were before
Down the line will we be something more
Or will you be the one i had adored

Will it be your flaws that weaponize my words
And the way i behave be the reason that we break
So don’t try to resign us baby
We need time to define us baby


[Verse 2: Axel Brizzy]
Everybody wishes for no fights
But as time past, they probably leave without a fight
Gotta pull your heartstrings, make you leave for the night
Then we come back stronger, stay over and we make up

Only face I wanna see when I wake up
Feeling some type of way? Then please say some
Yeah I heard, nothing good can stay
Nah I rather fight for this than to let it fade away

[Chorus: Of Methodist & ABBEY]
Wish we knew the things we’re fighting for
Wish we knew the way we were before
Down the line will we be something more
Or will you be the one i had adored

Will it be your flaws that weaponize my words
And the way i behave be the reason that we break
So don’t try to resign us baby
We need time to define us baby

[Outro: ABBEY & Axel Brizzy]
Will it be my flaws that u just can’t forget
And the way that we behave be our reason to this ache yeah
Let us pray that time is kind to us baby
Cos' I can’t just resign us baby
