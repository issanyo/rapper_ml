[Refrain]
Get lost, get lost
You get busy or get busy or get busy
Get lost, get lost
You get busy or get busy or get busy

[Verse 1: Alexandra Stan]
Wait Papa, sorry but I'm a big girl
Wait Papa, get lost, get lost
He walked and flipped everything in my world
Wait Papa, you get busy or get busy or get busy

[Pre-Chorus: Alexandra Stan]
Oh oh, I got to love him, I got to love him
For the rest of my life
I got to leave and I got to love him
And I'm guilty cause, I...

[Chorus: Alexandra Stan]
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it

[Refrain]
Get lost, get lost
You get busy or get busy or get busy
Get lost, get lost
You get busy or get busy or get busy

[Verse 2: Alexandra Stan]
Hey Papa, he ain't like everyone thinks
Wait Papa, get lost, get lost
No bad boy, whenever he is with me
Wait Papa, you get busy or get busy or get busy

[Pre-Chorus: Alexandra Stan]
Oh oh, I got to love him, I got to love him
For the rest of my life
I got to leave and I got to love him
And I'm guilty cause, I...

[Chorus: Alexandra Stan]
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it

[Bridge: Alexandra Stan]
You know well I'm here to stay
Boy, oh, boy, start coming my way
From now on nothing's the same
And you're the only one to blame
You know well I'm here to stay
Boy, oh, boy, start coming my way
From now on nothing's the same
And you're the only one to blame

[Pre-Chorus: Alexandra Stan]
Oh oh, I got to love him, got to love him
For the rest of my life
I got to leave and I got to love him
And I'm guilty cause, I...

[Chorus: Alexandra Stan]
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, Mama
Yes I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it
