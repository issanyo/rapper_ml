[Hook: AD3]
Look who I've become
No I'm not who I used to be
That man that you used to see
He's through me I'm not the same one
Flashy cars and jewelry
No longer are they moving me
Can't you see he's making me over
Over(4 times)
He's making me over over
And I'm not who I used to be
Get used to me
He's making me over

[Verse 1: Json]
I'm definitely not who I was but
No I'm not who I will be
But I'm becoming becoming someone who he's making me daily
Just watch and you'll see
Get used to me
Cause the man who you knew ain't no more
And the man who he is will soon be
Newly defined
Renewed in the mind
Attached to the vine as he pull me
Yes! he's making me over
Yes! my old heart man he took that
And I'm so far gone my mind has been blown
So just say that my wig has been pushed back back
I'm not settling back track
I'm not peddling that fact
Of the evident as I'm cracked cracked
Like a skeleton skeleton
Yeah so we're flipping the dime
Switching a pint of blow
Living to shine
Remember them times
But know that's not how I'm defined no more
I'm blind no more
It's time to go
I'm flying fo' sho'
They looking like how
He used to be wild and foul
He made me his child
But wow you just take a look at me now

[Hook: AD3]
Look who I've become
No I'm not who I used to be

[Verse 2: Json]
So let us just say
He is the potter and I am the clay
My heart is not flesh it's mushy wet yes
It's perfect for him to reshape
I'm just pottery
Dirt from the earth, just a vessel
Cursed, deserving the death yo
Was certainly a retch was made to confess
Because I've been purchased and blessed though
Now I'm living to die
They say that I'm dying to live
I'm trying to give him all I'm just part of me you should clearly that I am now his
I am now his you can keep watching me transform
And that's a truth I will stand on
And stand strong
The potter will perfectly mold when he gets his hands on
Get his hands on me
So look at the potter don't look at the pot
Look at the building don't look at the house
Look at the shepherd don't look at the flock
I belong to my God now
And I'm ready to fly now
And they looking like how
I used to be wild and foul he made me his child and wow
You just take a look at me now

[Hook: AD3]
Look who I've become
No I'm not who I used to be
That man that you used to see
He's through me I'm not the same one
Flashy cars and jewelry

Over(4 times)
He's making me over over
And I'm not who I used to be
Get used to me
He's making me over

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
My hearts been changed surgency
It's been replaced no surgery
I'm not the same different me ring that alarm emergency
Been a long time coming
But a change done finally came
Ain't that good news Sam cook I trusted in that name
Everyday, same old war
Feel ya pain say no more
The lie disguised alive fo' sho' but today's that day that I say no more
They can keep coming back but destroy me never
Hate all they want only makes me better
Trust in him with all of my givers
I ain't looking back man it's whatever
Fancy chains keep 'em
They leave me locked and beaten
Bruised up
Feeling used up
But I'm fueled up running on the power finding Jesus
And I promise that see who I am now imago dei
If I'm living than I'm living by the words he say
Running for his name till I ain't got nothing left
Sound weird how I live in him call it dub step

[Hook: AD3]
