Yeah! These are our growing pains
Let's go

Look at my soul, then look at my heart
Then look at my scars and look at my face
Look at the cross and look at His palms
Look at them thorns, you're looking at grace yeah
So when he's allowing pain it's afflicting me
I'm just simmering I'm more tender meat, rotisserie
He'll take me out when he's ready though it seems awful long
At the end I'm better seasoned, flesh falling off the bones
But I know what it's like when I'm crushed
Because of my bad decisions bars
Minus the track listing, package ripped, no merry Christmas
He's whispering
I'm hearing my enemy telling me foe
But I've been picked up cause of his mercy
So it's my Lord that's telling me no
Telling me watch, telling me run
Telling me fight, telling me go
Tell me keep guard, look at The Son
After the pain then I will grow
So, just know that I'm reading when water's banging up on my levy
The Rock, He got me, He'll spot me
Whenever the load is heavy
And it's for certain just know it
That living for is worship or promise this hurting
Suffering truly has a purpose
We'll grow

I will go through the pain
I will fight through the dark
Walk with me as it rains
As you break me apart
But I need you to help me
I need you to help me
I need you to help me
I need you to help me
I will grow through the pain
Through the pain I will grow
I will grow through the pain
Through the pain I will grow
I will grow through the pain
Through the pain I will grow
I will grow through the pain
Through the pain I will grow
