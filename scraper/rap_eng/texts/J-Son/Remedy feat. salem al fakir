Take it to the top of the world
Take it to the top of the world
I was lost in the dark nobody hearing me
Now I'm up in the sky I found my remedy

Take it to the top of the world
Take it to the top of the world
To the end from the start
I know that you agree
Now we up in the sky
We found the remedy

Take a day at a time enjoy the sounds by the red-light
Better to get there safe than get ahead life
Living a dream with the headlights
And I just do it up top my name should-a been air nikes
Now they all looking where did the vibe go
Bringing it back you should be calling me Bob Hope
Without the acting music satisfaction
This is feel good real good make it happen
I used to play 'em my song my heart aching
But never forsaking speed I'm never breaking
For us to make history it's unusual
But dude so I carry on what I'm used to do
Time pass but the memory will last
So celebrate your future reminiscing yo past
To reach for the moon it's true I gotta blast
But I took it to the tip of the top I stand fast

Take it to the top of the world
Take it to the top of the world
I was lost in the dark nobody hearing me
Now I'm up in the sky I found my remedy

Take it to the top of the world
Take it to the top of the world
To the end from the start
I know that you agree
Now we up in the sky
We found the remedy

Think I found my remedy
I had to change ways put the negative aside today and so
Think I found my remedy
I had to change ways put the negative aside today we gotta change

Best believe yo I think I found the key
No enemies around I'm free and that's my remedy
Out with the negative positive to retrieve
Sometimes you gotta push it away gotta believe
Beyond doubt, far away from the hate
To become great I need a piece of mind to create
So I stand tall, I figured I gain weight
Everybody talk but I'm not into no debate
Action 'cause talk is cheap
I wanna speak to you straight I ain't tryna be deep
Take a leap and find out we unique
To show that you're positive, it's not a sign of showing you're weak
Holding on to what matter the most
Not the money, can't take it with you when becoming a ghost
So I don't wanna hear the brag and boast
I just wanna say welcome to the life and tonight I'm your host

Take it to the top of the world
Take it to the top of the world
I was lost in the dark nobody hearing me
Now I'm up in the sky I found my remedy

Take it to the top of the world
Take it to the top of the world
To the end from the start
I know that you agree
Now we up in the sky
We found the remedy

If everything's apart of we
Then why do we feel alone
If we agree to disagree
'Cause I never lost my hope
Even with nowhere to go on a lonely road
So I'm singing

Take it to the top of the world
Take it to the top of the world
I was lost in the dark nobody hearing me
Now I'm up in the sky I found my remedy

Take it to the top of the world
Take it to the top of the world
To the end from the start
I know that you agree
Now we up in the sky
We found the remedy

Think I found my remedy
I had to change ways put the negative aside today and so
Think I found my remedy
I had to change ways put the negative aside today we gotta change
Think I found my remedy
I had to change ways put the negative aside today and so
Think I found my remedy
I had to change ways put the negative aside today we gotta change
