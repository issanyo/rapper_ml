[Verse 1 – Rio]
And I’m in love with my city, southwest, north side
Dudes ballin’ every day, homie I ain’t talking court side
Got homies in the workouts tryna get that work out
I’m praying for their situation, hoping that it works out
I’m seeing homicides on the block, dope boys on the block
A little this and that, best believe me man, that’s on the block
I’m speaking what I see, I got a burden for the Lou
I pray my city wake up before it’s curtains for the Lou

[Verse 2 – Future]
Cats be riding low in a Challenger, smoking looking to damage ya
Hoping that you enamored just so they can cock and blam at ya
This just the land of the bandits, we call ‘em animals
We need to man up and give the gospel and face these cannibals
So who gon’ do it? “Send me, I’ll go”
Yeah I’m scared but I’m gon’ do it … “Send me, I’ll go”
Give me Jesus and my fam and give my my Bible
And for St. Louis I’m gon’ stand till I’m deceased and eyes closed

[Chorus – Flame]
STL, I sing this song
Because I see a thing wrong
And no the Flame no longer lonely
But I’ma tell you what I’m gon’ be
I’m gonna pray for my city
I share my faith with my city
I’m not forsaking my city
Let’s go, I’m straight for my city

[Verse 3 – S.A.V.E.D.]
Welcome to STL, home of them interceders
Our city need us to shine bright and point ‘em to Jesus
Just read the Evening Word and you can find a thousand reasons
To preach the gospel, and plus it’s hostile season to season
We ain’t taking a break because we know the Lord’s grievin’
Any block that you want Biggie, this the land of the heathen
So there’s plenty of work to do, time to get ‘em believin’
And snatch the ones out the devil’s hands that he’s been deceivin’

[Verse 4 – MikeREAL]
STL I love you, that’s why my music knockin’
The gospel through your speakers, you can call it sound doctrine
I’m praying for my city, ‘cause I am so so so …
St. Louis to the death of me, to forsake ‘em is a no no no
That’s why I go go go, gotta keep feeding that Word
You can call me McDonald’s baby … I’m tryna get a million served
See some just see the arch, but God he sees the heart
So pray for the 314 before it falls apart

[Chorus – Flame]
STL, I sing this song
Because I see a thing wrong
And no the Flame no longer lonely
But I’ma tell you what I’m gon’ be
I’m gonna pray for my city
I share my faith with my city
I’m not forsaking my city
Let’s go, I’m straight for my city

[Verse 5 – Flame]
When I think about all we done been through, when I think about cats that done got shot
When I think about drugs that done came through, ‘82 like all the way to ‘95
When I think about guns, I think about clubs, I think about gats and dimes
I think about rappers, think about pastors, something gotta happen man
I love my city to death, but yet the problem here
Seem like my city of death, and that’s a problem here
But I got one thing to say: we gon’ pray, we gon’ preach
We gon’ teach, we gon’ reach the streets preaching this Jesus peace

[Verse 6 – Json]
I’m on post for my city, my heart’s broke for my city
Put a toast in the city ‘cause they livin’ like no hope’s in the city
So I put my all in it, hear the track beat like my heart’s in it
I’m a part of it, called to the city where the Arch is it, call ‘em all to repent
Know my aim, I came from them slums; hear the bang bang and mangle they drum
Here to rep his name and came to lift some, praying for pain ‘cause change is gon’ come
St. Louis, I’m in love with you, but I ain’t gon’ lie, got a grudge with you
‘Cause I see all the drugs and slugs that come with you, so I’m posted up until the blood hit you

[Chorus – Flame]
STL, I sing this song
Because I see a thing wrong
And no the Flame no longer lonely
But I’ma tell you what I’m gon’ be
I’m gonna pray for my city
I share my faith with my city
I’m not forsaking my city
Let’s go, I’m straight for my city
