[Verse 1: J-Son & (Mikeschair)]
(It's alright)
Walls are closin' in
I know what it's like
To fight when nothing at all in life seems to be going right (It's okay)
The pressures heavy on you
I'm talkin' heavy pressure
You look around and everyone else is doin' better (it's alright)
Often you are, you are runnin' but stumblin'
Dollars you make, they go out as fast as they comin' in
Man, and you're struglin' just to stay afloat
Relating to Peter, it's safer just to stay in the boat (it's alright)
Open the blinds cause I'm just too distracted to see
Making no sense of why this stuff just keeps happenin' to me
The white flags in your hand ready to wave it
I pray you hear that still voice inside when you be prayin' sayin'

[Hook: Mikeschair]
Lay it all down at His feet
When it makes no sense
It's okay
It's alright
'Cause He sees and knows your needs
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
So don't stress, go to your knees

[Verse 2: J-Son]
When someone asks for pie and his father give him mud
So how much more would the Father in Heaven show His love
From every jot and tittle
Things big and small
Every hair on your head
Yea He cares for it all
He sees your needs and knows 'em
From the job that you lose
The car breakin' down
Kids givin' ya' blues
So when the weight that's on ya'
Brings ya' to ya' knees
Trust is where you should be
And cast out on your knees
That's why the veil was cracked
That's why the grace was shown
To give you access, to the King on the throne

[Hook: Mikeschair]
Lay it all down at His feet
When it makes no sense
It's okay
It's alright
'Cause He sees and knows your needs
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
So don't stress, go to your knees

[Bridge: Mikeschair]
All your worries couldn't add a single moment to your life
'Cause when you worry, you don't trust Him
Turn and run to the light
And don't be anxious
He'll give you peace that transcends all your strife
He's got amazing plans for you so run with all your might

[Outro: Mikeschair]
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
'Cause He sees and knows your needs
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
So don't stress go to your knees
It's alright (x7)
