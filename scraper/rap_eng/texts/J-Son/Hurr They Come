[Intro]
Soldiers for Christ...
Look, hurr they come...
Soldiers for Christ...

[Verse 1]
You catch us in the long T's, fitted hats, it ain't suits that we wearin'
Well how can we tell you Christian? 'Cause the fruit that we bearin'
See, a seed was planted that produced salvation
We're filled with the Spirit so we the bear the fruit of Galatians, man
And when you see us, we ain't unwrappin' them swishers
We've been given the sack of forgiveness, we crackin' them Scriputures, man
So you gon' notice we on post with our life
We stand on the word with boldness 'cause we soldiers for Christ
Look, we something like them dudes from 116
We ain't ashamed, forget one mic, give me one more script
So I can begin to take the truth to the block
Uproot the dudes that been duped 'cause you can lose on your rock
But move to the Rock, believe me, the truth'll hold ya
We're wet with the living water like a Super Soaker
Who can hold us back? It's a group of soldiers
Lone on the Holy Ghost so you can lose the dozier

[Hook]
We ain't drinkin' liquor (nope), we ain't blowin' trees (uh-uh)
Our life has been surrendered (yep), we want to know He's pleased (c'mon)
But you might see us with the Cross on the block
Posted, shining like diamonds 'cause we flossin' the Rock (c'mon)
(X2)

[Verse 2]
Taking the gospel across the globe, the book of Acts is clear
Man, God is all around like the atmosphere
The tactic here is for you to get a piece of this matchless
Love that covers you up like a sheet on a mattress
It's above the average, His blood is captured
Wrath intended for us, so what can match it?
So, why would I even grab bub and crack it
Knowing the suds will be crushed when He judges our actions?
And, what happens when your platinum plaque is gone
And all the money is blown, like a saxophone?
You know what we on, we gon' spit the bars for Him
Regardless of ends, and pray your heart is hardened to sin
So, miss me with the tipsy bit
When wickedness falls down like some Pixy Stix
I'm spitting this, so get the drift
We're different 'cause we've been to Romans 6 and 6! C'mon!

[Hook]
We ain't drinkin' liquor (nope), we ain't blowin' trees (uh-uh)
Our life has been surrendered (yep), we want to know He's pleased (c'mon)
But you might see us with the Cross on the block
Posted, shining like diamonds 'cause we flossin' the Rock (c'mon)
(X2)

[Verse 3]
See, it's simply on the basis we wanna please Him
That's the reason we don't do the things to grieve Him
Man, He died for us, that's an abundance of grace
Without Him, you'll go nowhere fast like you're running in place
Plus, if you can't tell, I've been bent on the light
Hoping the events of my life will give you a glimpse of the Christ
So we don't grow what you're drinking and smoking on
My concern is what you gon' do once all the smoke is gone

[Hook]
We ain't drinkin' liquor (nope), we ain't blowin' trees (uh-uh)
Our life has been surrendered (yep), we want to know He's pleased (c'mon)
But you might see us with the Cross on the block
Posted, shining like diamonds 'cause we flossin' the Rock (c'mon)

[Outro]
Soldiers for Christ...
