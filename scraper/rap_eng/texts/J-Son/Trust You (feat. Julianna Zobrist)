Chorus
You chose me/
You chose us/
You gave hope you showed me love/
So I choose you/
I choose us/
I choose hope and I choose love/
And if I love you I trust You/
Verse 1
For you ever said let their be and the light would shine/
For the air I would breathe was made I was on your mind/
Prior to time having been created/
Before the masses of water covered the earths foundation/
I was already elected/
A demonstration of your grace a produce of your affections/
Nothing I did got me selected/
Your where just showing your grace to me/
And Lord thankfully you gave faith to see/
Your love makes me response faithfully/
So I patiently look to wait and see the white horse with that rider/
With them diadems and them eyes of his burning like a flame of fire/
Every word he say we can trust in/
Cause He can't lie he has crushed sin/
If I say that I love Him who can I trust if I dont trust Him/
Chorus
Lord the winds and the waves they obey you/
The stars, the sun, the moon, the skies they display you,/
Im grateful that you would call on me/
Though I desire I struggle to give you all of me/
So guide me Lord when I seek me and not seek you/
Let my eye say whats good and I sneek through and I eat fruit/
Just like them I hide behind my own leaves too/
Not just Adam Im Eve too/
When I need to just seek you heed truth and believe you/
You love me so I can love you/
Chose me so I can choose you/
So I choose to hope in where hope is cause Im hopeless/
Your love I just can't explain it/
Its not one word in our language/
That contains it but Christ is the perfect picture to paint it I trust you/
