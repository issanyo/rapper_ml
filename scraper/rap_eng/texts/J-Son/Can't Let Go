[Chorus - B.Reith]
When the rain falls, and the wind blows
I’ll keep holding on to you
I can’t let go

[Verse 1 - Json]
Can’t see it but I’ll believe it
Well let me run that back ‘cause believing has got me seeing
See it? They tell me life is a balance, put it all on a scale
And try to weigh it up but it’s just a couple of nails
Living by the Spirit, but sometimes it just seems like it’s a hole inside my ceiling
All the rain that I’ve been feeling
Rain coming through my ceiling, dealing with what I deal with
I don’t know if he hear me, but I do know how I’m feeling
‘Cause I, I never get drizzles - only pouring rain
But somebody told me endure, it’s just a growing pain”
Well, look all that I could roam through
Is not who’s holding on, it’s who you are holding on to
Same God that save me, same God that’ll keep me
When life’s turbulence is tryna defeat me
Though I’m fighting through the struggling and stressin’
Through it all I’ve learned one life lesson, I can’t let go

[Chorus - B.Reith]
When the rain falls, and the wind blows
I’ll keep holding on to you
When my eyes can’t see what’s in front of me
I’ll keep holding on to you
I can’t let go

[Verse 2 - S.O.]
What I fear in my heart groaning
Stare at my past and see all of the stark moments
All of my dark growing, no need to ask
I have seen with the cross, take a seat on my path
Dark nights when I can see that they’re easily marred
A harsh plight I demonstrate but could easily mask
Maybe reckon I was getting the deception every second
Hear the messes in my message, how evil we are
This is an evil in chant, no letting go, don’t let it
See the Son throw reverend, bring him stronghold wreckage
One hope even when the storms go stressing
Keep your long nose ‘cause we got the Lord though, get it?
So ‘cause of Jesus, I ain’t never letting go
Rather he ain’t letting me; I’m the sheep, he’s the G.O.A.T
The greatest of all treasures, you should see, then you know
That the storms brew, but I never cease from his whole life

[Chorus - B.Reith]
When the rain falls, and the wind blows
I’ll keep holding on to you
When my eyes can’t see what’s in front of me
I’ll keep holding on to you
I can’t let go

[Hook - B.Reith]
Oh oh oh oh
I can’t let go oh oh oh oh
These storms keep coming and they won’t stop raining
My heart’s been flooded, now I just can’t take it no more
I can’t keep going on
But when I’m weak, you’re strong
And you keep holding on to me, I can’t let go

[Chorus - B.Reith]
When the rain falls, and the wind blows
I’ll keep holding on to you
When my eyes can’t see what’s in front of me
I’ll keep holding on to you
I can’t let go
