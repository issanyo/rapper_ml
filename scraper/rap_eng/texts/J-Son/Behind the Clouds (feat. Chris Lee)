[Verse 1 – Json]
Your back to the wall (wall), you feelin’ the hurt (hurt)
Your head to the sky (sky), your knees to the dirt (dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt)
Why when we going through it right in that moment then
Do we begin to believe that the moment won’t end?
After the sun sets, then won’t the sun rise?
After the rain pours, then won’t the sun shine?
Look at them mothers, pain felt in delivery
Who hears her babies cry and the pain becomes a memory
Yeah, I just wanna remind you
Your now will be a then, you’ll just look at behind you
Surely the God of all glory
Will take me, break me, and then he’ll restore me (store me)
Hey, so when the sky’s looking gray above
Know his grave was dug just so we can taste his love
Yeah, so stop trying to dodge the raindrops
Hide under his wings and watch the rain stop

[Chorus – Chris Lee]
At the dawn of every new day
Lies a proof that night will fade
And just like a mother forgets her pain
When she sees her baby’s face
As she holds her smile
And the joy my heart contains
Makes it all worthwhile
Even when rain is falling down
You shine behind the clouds

Na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na …
Whooaaaohh …
Na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na …
You shine behind the clouds

[Verse 2 – Json]
When it seems like dark clouds are following ya
Know, the very rain makes the trees grow
Oh, as you’re attached to the vine and pruning may hurt
You don’t know what he’s doing at first
He’s truly at work, so you just look the pain in its face
As his strength will carry you through displaying his grace
The favor of faith, you just watch the praise when you’re done
‘Cause after the storms of death came the rays of the sun

[Chorus – Chris Lee]
At the dawn of every new day
Lies a proof that night will fade
And just like a mother forgets her pain
When she sees her baby’s face
As she holds her smile
And the joy my heart contains
Makes it all worthwhile
Even when rain is falling down
You shine behind the clouds

[Bridge – Chris Lee]
Some days this life involves
Things that challenge my heart
You don’t change that’s why I’m staying
You’re with me through it all
So my joy will never leave
‘Cause it provides the strength I need
When it seems the pain won’t go away …

[Chorus – Chris Lee]
At the dawn of every new day
Lies a proof that night will fade
And just like a mother forgets her pain
When she sees her baby’s face
As she holds her smile
And the joy my heart contains
Makes it all worthwhile
Even when rain is falling down
You shine behind the clouds

[Chorus – Chris Lee]
At the dawn of every new day
Lies a proof that night will fade
And just like a mother forgets her pain
When she sees her baby’s face
As she holds her smile
And the joy my heart contains
Makes it all worthwhile
Even when rain is falling down
You shine behind the clouds

Na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na …
You shine behind the clouds …
Na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na …
Whooaaaohh …
Na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na …
You shine behind the clouds
