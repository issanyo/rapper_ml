[Verse 1]
Json what happen, why Reach ain't sign you? You unashamed?
You 1-1-6, why Lecrae ain't never saying your name?
You ain't been on they albums lately
They ain't took you on no tours
Man, them yo homies, man, what’s popping y'all cool, are you sure?
You signed to Lamp Mode ain't you? What's up with that decision
How’s that going, I'll be honest man yall just sound so different
You a Calvinist right? Is it true, could you please
Just let me know I'm hearing things 'bout what y'all dudes believe
Wait, hold up
Nah they ain't sign me but it's good it ain't happen to work
I'm 1-1-6 I will be this 'til I'm dead in the dirt
Our relationship was never based off no albums and songs
But love a brotherly bond to this day it's very strong
Lamp modes my label I love them and though our music's different
Our heart congruent consistent with God who offers forgiveness
As far as where I stand, keep the Calvinist title
I'm a Christian, I believe in what I see in the Bible

[Chorus]
It's so much up in the air so why you running away, running away
We heard the good and the bad so what do you got to say, you got to say
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back

[Verse 2]
J You a Christian rapper or a rapper that’s Christian?
Call me whatever as long as you hear truth when you listen
I ain't got no time to sit and debate 'bout no petty name
When it's dudes in the streets that think life is a deadly game
Now you moved to Idaho
Nah fam man Iowa
Really?
What made you leave St. Louis we know you love for your city
The Lord told me to go, I'm on staff at a church
A pastor?
Nah just outreach stuff, man, I'm doing His work
I left kicking and screaming but moving brought growth and faith
I'm moving back in a few years just to serve at the gate
Tell us bout Duece and Truth, you think they real or fake?
Falling don't make you phony, just means you need His grace
The Lord humbled them dudes, I was broke when I heard that news
Cause from a distance they both instilled in me lots of truths
I don't love them no less and though I was upset
Thank God for repentance and I wish my brothers the best

[Chorus]
It's so much up in the air so why you running away, running away
We heard the good and the bad so what do you got to say, you got to say
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back

[Bridge]
So much going around, so many questions
I don't mind sharing my heart
Hope you feel it
I ain't got a reason to hold nothing back
Ooh, shine the light
Ooh, shine the light
Ooh, shine the light
Ooh, shine the light

[Chorus]
It's so much up in the air so why you running away, running away
We heard the good and the bad so what do you got to say, you got to say
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
I ain't gonna hold nothing back
