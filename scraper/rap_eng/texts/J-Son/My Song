Now the world be playing my song
Playing my song
Playing my song
Now the world be playing my song
Moving all night long

You said I was no good
Had me feeling miss understood
I was aiming for the sky
But you told me I couldn't fly

But look at me now since you've been gone
I'm doing good, I'll moving on
Baby I never felt this strong
So baby for leaving me behind
Hiding your tongue don't lose your mind
Couldn't believe that I would try

Now the world be playing my song
Playing my song
Playing my song
Now the world be playing my song
Moving all night long
Now the world be playing my song
Playing my song
Playing my song
Now the world be playing my song
Moving all night long

They put like a model chin
I hope I got you feeling so damn sick
You never thought I would come this far
But here I am, another fighting star

But look at me now since you've been gone
I'm doing good, I'll moving on
Baby I never felt this strong
So baby for leaving me behind
Riding your tongue don't lose your mind
Couldn't believe that I would try

Now the world be playing my song
Playing my song
Playing my song
Now the world be playing my song
Moving all night long
Now the world be playing my song
Playing my song
Playing my song
Now the world be playing my song
Moving all night long

Now the world be playing my song
Playing my song
Playing my song
Now the world be playing my song
Moving all night long
Now the world be playing my song
Playing my song
Playing my song
Now the world be playing my song
Moving all night long

Remember all these games you played
You don't know oh how good it taste
To see the sad look on your face
Run away it's a brand new day
Those eyes are flashing in the sky
I'm blind but still I see you cry
Truth's out and now I'm fly and reach
Chapter's done to this memory

Now the world be playing my song
Playing my song
Playing my song
Now the world be playing my song
Moving all night long
Now the world be playing my song
Playing my song
Playing my song
Now the world be playing my song
Moving all night long
