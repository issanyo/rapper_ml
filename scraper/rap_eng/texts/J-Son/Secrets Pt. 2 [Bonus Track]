Probably didn't know
Secrets 1 was about my wife
Sexual abuse doesn't only affect the victim
This is my perspective

[Verse 1]
Helplessness is such a sad felling
One flesh I feel what my other half's feeling
Second victim but listen
I feel like I'm the man on the side of the man on her side
It's a difference
Know what it's like
To look the love of your life inside of her face
And all you're seeing is hopelessness
Wanna kiss her, touch her, hug her
But the most intimate moments just remind her of brokenness
I feel so pushed away
I know that sounds so silly
So I take my feelings and bury them
It ain't about me really
But it's about me really
Face it, when that pain so deep
I'm starting to think I can taste it
Hurts the more I'm concealing it
Hearing these Christian slogans
Nobody knows what I'm dealing with
Are they hearing this
Look if you just peep my eyes
You'll hear a secret deep inside I can't hide

That's the other part of me
No she's not a victim alone
I wish I could erase her tears
But I need someone to dry my own
I know this ain't about me
Won't make this thing about me
But please I hope you're hearing me
It's been deep in my heart
I live life in the dark
[x4] It's tearing me apart, tearing me apart

[Verse 2]
Real talk, I'm feeling like I could murk dude
Hurt her and I hurt you
Lord forgive me I don't know what's getting into me
Mentally its the enemy gahh
So many questions I can ask
You can't defend the present from the past
Seems like nobody understands
I can't protect her I'm feeling less than a man
Stressed as I am there's no way to console her
So much distance between us
Will we be any closer
I just want what we had
Lord will we get any closure
I wanna stand behind her
But so much weight on my shoulders
Wait, who am I to really think that I make her complete
When there's a savior who has promised to offer us piece
Jehovah Rapha life couldn't be any realer
So I intercede that by your grace you would come and heal her and me
Because..

That's the other part of me
She's not a victim alone
I wish I could erase her tears
But I need someone to dry my own
I know this ain't about me
Won't make this thing about me
But please I hope you're hearing me
It's been deep in my heart
I live life in the dark
[x4] It's tearing me apart, tearing me apart
