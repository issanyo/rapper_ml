[Hook: Ron Kenoly Jr.]
You say you trust me
But I always see you worry
Haven't I held it down
Held it down at your back
Got your back
You say you trust me
But I always see you worry
Haven't I held it down
Held it down at your back
Got your back

[Verse 1: Json]
Uh loving you has never been an issue for me
Looking back, never thought I would see these issues coming
No, and though that love hasn't change any
I no longer see my cup half full but half empty
Know what happens to a man when a woman that he's feeling isn't with him
And is not cracking with his plans
And I know when it's rocky now but calm down
The truth is I always have held a job down
I understand that you worry but I do need you to be my help-meet and just allow me to lead you
And since the baby, the new addition is fanning flames
But everybody has sunny days
Will we stand the rain?
I know we will, I have your back and I give you my last
But it's a plus, we see as grace instead of the bad
And I often sit and wonder what happened to us
And after wondering I think what we're lacking is trust

[Hook: Ron Kenoly Jr.]
You say you trust me
But I always see you worry
Haven't I held it down
Held it down at your back
Got your back
You say you trust me
But I always see you worry
Haven't I held it down
Held it down at your back
Got your back

[Verse 2: Butta P]
Uh, loving you 's never been an issue for me
I'm looking back, never thought I would see these issues coming
Uh and though that love hasn't change any
I no longer see my cup half full but half empty
I feel underappreciated and right at the core
It's like my role isn't as important compared to yours
And you say I'm doing nothing but be real now
I'm always at the crib just holding the house and kids down
And I don't mind it being rocky would you please see?
I just need you explaining things as you lead me
This is postpartum depression I'm not wilin' out
You know I'd be right behind you baby without a doubt
I know we'll make it but I need you to know that I'm here
And I ain't giving up 'cause I shed a couple of tears
But I often sit and wonder what happened to us
And after wondering I think what we're lacking is trust

[Hook: Ron Kenoly Jr.]
You say you trust me
But I always see you worry
Haven't I held it down
Held it down at your back
Got your back
You say you trust me
But I always see you worry
Haven't I held it down
Held it down at your back
Got your back

[Verse 3: Json]
Uh I am love so loving you ain't a issue for me
Look at my son and point out a better picture to me
You know my heart but I can show you it real simply
All you must do is look at the tomb still empty
You have faith in me to save and embrace you as heirs
But where's your faith in me in all of your daily affairs?
And I'm knowing you having a rocky time now
But I'm the sovereign God who speaks and waves calm down
So why not trust in me? In fact I deserve it
See there's a purpose 'cause your faith in me 's a act of worship
So be anxious for nothing and cast only you weary
My hope is easy 'cause your burden I'm willing to carry
Consider the grass here today and then mown down
The cove down so you are most certainly hove down
And I never need to wonder what happens with us
I know it all so I know what you lacking is trust

[Hook: Ron Kenoly Jr.]
You say you trust me
But I always see you worry
Haven't I held it down
Held it down at your back
Got your back
You say you trust me
But I always see you worry
Haven't I held it down
Held it down at your back
Got your back
Got your back
Got your back
Got your back
