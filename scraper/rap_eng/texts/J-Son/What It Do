[Verse 1 – Titus]
Hey what it do, does the truth came down your avenue
Givin' you that 20/20 but no need for attributes
So see that Christ is king well what's inside your treasure chest
Don't know why God? We murderers we kill the flesh
We serve the best He crush the rest I thought I told you
Our King so great He makes Alexander look mediocre
Now hold up, no sir, boy you must be trippin’
The resurrection from Christ affliction has been redemption
If you say we rippin’ but don't get it you should reverse it
Come back to the first look how 'cause Christ is the top of your purpose
So what you stoppin’ for? Go give them what they askin’ for
Christ loved us so much he died for sin, high metaphor
Look at the picture boy we in this grind we goin’ true
Like Catholic sinners we bring our confessions right into the booth
100 fruits go blend it in, this here is absolute
Like Tropicana juice we bear the fruit, now tell me …

[Hook – Json & Trip Lee]
Hey whatchu do?
Daily dyin’, I ain't mine, I belong to him
Hey whatchu do?
Holy grind, all the time, on the grind for him
Hey whatchu do?
Renew my mind, all the time, when I'm in the streets
Hey what it do?
You might find me, and mine when you’re on the streets
That’s what it do

Already make it do what it do
That's what it do
Already make it do what it do
That's what it do
Already make it do what it do
That's what it do
Already make it do what it do
That's what it do

[Verse 2 – Trip Lee]
Hey you got questions for me like what I'm doin’ on a daily basis?
I love the light and hate the dark, since I been saved I'm racist
I'm trying to rep the God who saved me, said he’d trade me places
And by his grace my ways was straightened like them legs with braces
I'm tryin’ to grow up in the faith forget them baby skaters
That's why I'm training every day like I play for the Lakers
My crew reveal with Him man, we took his grace and drank it
Some call it drunk in the Spirit but you might say I'm wasted
And cats is burnin’ to know
What's poppin’ after the music stops and them curtains is closed
Yes sir we servin’ and we worship Him, we certainly go
And hit the curb 'cause cats is hurtin’ and this world doesn’t know him
That's why we servin’ in whole, we reimburse as we go
Gettin’ to cats so they can know Him, they can learn and be grown
This life is harder when my back’s on the wall
But remind myself that my own self is dead, casket and all

[Hook – Json & Trip Lee]

[Verse 3 – Json]
I rep Christ (rep Christ) ’cause I know for my sins he was martyred
I die with him so say hello to the dearly departed
Perhaps you might hear me rappin’, I'm not nearly an artist
The fact is I happen to spit like I'm really retarded
Was weary-hearted when Christ came in and then did an audit
Saw that the law demanded that every man would live Godless
But then he switched my aim, gave me a new direction
I live to lift his name, hope you see a reflection
I resemble my daddy, not in physical either
I personally inherited his character feature (that's what it do)
So yeah my pants is baggy and still my fitted lean
But if my head cause me to sin then bring on the guillotine
See my actions have stopped since I'm attached to the Rock
Who died and popped out the grave like a Jack-in-the-Box
Who you know murdered death huh? Well then death couldn't murder
It's Christ the King we rep, with every breath we give Him worship
