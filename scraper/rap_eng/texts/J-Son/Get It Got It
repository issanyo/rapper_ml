[Hook: S.O. & Json]
I could feel the pressure all the way (All the way I feel it)
The world'll never like us but it's all good (Ohh)
Standing till they put us in the grave (Ah)
(We ain't afraid homie) Get it, get it, got it, good
(Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!)
Get it, get it, got it, good
(Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!)
Get it, get it, got it, good
(Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!)
Get it, get it, got it, good
(Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!)
Get it, get it, got it, good

[Verse 1: S.O.]
Get it, get it, got it
I ain't tryna brag with what's in my wallet
See that lady winking at me
Tell that lady bird I ain't on it
Think what you want my man, you're my team
But you ain't gettin' none of my Bonet
Christ rules everything around me
That crème de la crème is all that I'm wantin'
I'm wantin' my life to be like His
Stand where the righteous picked up the pen and I'm writing
Kicked off the care what appears that I'm here
But appear when I once used the pair but I'm right
Yeah, Yeah, light shine bright
In the night with the right wear
I'm thinkin' hindsight, thinkin' My Dear
I'm duckin' the limelight seein' my fear
I'm busy just setting the scene
They chasin' the lizzy well let 'em be seen
I could feel pressure but I am a messenger
Tryna get people to trust in The King (My God)
The One that they call Yahweh
Stand firm and affirm till they call my name
One thing I have blood bettin' on my days
Unaware of a snake see I'm on that grace
I feel the pressure huh
