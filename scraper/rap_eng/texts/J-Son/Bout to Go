[Hook]
We bout to go (we bout to go)
We passin’ through (we passin’ through)
We bout to go (we bout to go)
I thought you knew (I thought you knew)
To be with him (we bout to go)
To be with him (we bout to go)
To be with him (we bout to go)
To be with him (we bout to go)
See we just really passin’ through
See we just really passin’ through
See we just really passin’ through
See we just really passin’ through
We bout to go (we bout to go)
We passin’ through (to be with him)
We bout to go (we bout to go)
We bout to go (we bout to go to be with him)

[Verse 1]
I’m passing through, homie I’m bout to go
Christ got the keys to death’s grave and I’m out the door
And this is it, here to please the one that I’m enlisted with
I pitched my tent but this ain’t it, maranatha Jesus get me quick
Get me quick, come get me quick, see ever since the Master came
Earth is just a passing lane and death well that’s the baggage claim
So I’m out to make him known ‘cause he paid the cost for me
This earth it ain’t my home, can’t get attached to what it offers me
Where my believers with me, and though we’ll be afflicted
Know they’ll be leaving with me, and we will be the city
Just call us new Jerus, And we’ll savior our Savior
A King who truly rules, city lit like it’s Vegas

[Hook]
We bout to go (we bout to go)
We passin’ through (we passin’ through)
We bout to go (we bout to go)
I thought you knew (I thought you knew)
To be with him (we bout to go)
To be with him (we bout to go)
To be with him (we bout to go)
To be with him (we bout to go)
See we just really passin’ through
See we just really passin’ through
See we just really passin’ through
See we just really passin’ through
We bout to go (we bout to go)
We passin’ through (to be with him)
We bout to go (we bout to go)
We bout to go (we bout to go to be with him)

[Verse 2]
You ain’t know it, look we gon’ be going
Please know it won’t be D-Flow when you hear them trumpets blowin’
Think we lost our mind, they say the Christians crazy
We won’t invest our time in what’s rusting and fading
He was crushed for the payment for my lusting and craving
For what just would enslave me, now know I’m trusting Hhim baby
In the world but not of it, no not of it just in
Oil and water won’t mix, no us and the world it won’t blend
You know that you finna go, you know who you livin’ for
Hold all you got loosely ‘cause it won’t go with you when you go
Homie you should really know exactly how the truth taste
Look at the big picture, keep living outta your suitcase

[Hook]
We bout to go (we bout to go)
We passin’ through (we passin’ through)
We bout to go (we bout to go)
I thought you knew (I thought you knew)
To be with him (we bout to go)
To be with him (we bout to go)
To be with him (we bout to go)
To be with him (we bout to go)
See we just really passin’ through
See we just really passin’ through
See we just really passin’ through
See we just really passin’ through
We bout to go (we bout to go)
We passin’ through (to be with him)
We bout to go (we bout to go)
We bout to go (we bout to go to be with him)

[Verse 3]
Keep living your life in light of the next one
The light is perfection, we fight to reflect him out
The weight of the world’s wearing on me
Trout keep swimming against the current, homie
Yessirrrr keep holding on homie, clutch tight
There’s pressure, you’re sealed so that it won’t bust pipes
Your sites fixed on the one who is your only hope
Soon he will be coming, so then we know we know we bout to go

[Hook]
We bout to go (we bout to go)
We passin’ through (we passin’ through)
We bout to go (we bout to go)
I thought you knew (I thought you knew)
To be with him (we bout to go)
To be with him (we bout to go)
To be with him (we bout to go)
To be with him (we bout to go)
See we just really passin’ through
See we just really passin’ through
See we just really passin’ through
See we just really passin’ through
We bout to go (we bout to go)
We passin’ through (to be with him)
We bout to go (we bout to go)
We bout to go (we bout to go to be with him)
