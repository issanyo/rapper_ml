[Verse 1 – Flame]
Hey Mr. DJ, come and holler at your boy
Put me on replay, I got bars that won’t destroy
See I got bars that make sense, and I got truth that sets free
And I got beats that go hard, and their not playing don’t make sense to me
Since I ain’t rappin’ about poppin’ mollies, tryna get spins like boxing Ali
In his prime, but I got the dolly, I’m lifting up the K-I-N-G
“They don’t play yo song?” I’m like, “not probably”; boxing me out, I’m like Yali
Unless I’m rapping that nonsense, or conscious rapping – Talib Kweli
A-I-N-T that conduit, I’m the emcee with the kind of rap
Where the far-reaching, where Ghana at, Uganda at, Botswana at
By the God in the flesh incarnate, perfect life that they hear and hate
Crucified, resurrected, the kind of rap with them kind of facts

[Chorus – Flame]
They cut on the radio, they say they can’t find me
They cut on the video, they say they can’t find me
DJ, play my song
DJ, play my song
DJ, play my song
DJ, play my song
(Repeat)

[Verse 2 – Json]
Yeah, got the truth packed into them lines, boy
God just fixed our broken lives, boy
Homeboy, you know what we do
Tell the DJ go’n and spin me truth
Every station playin’ these same songs, I’m tired of hearing dudes grind and shinin’
Selling drugs to these minors, ‘cause all I hear is dope lines, I promise
Kush this, pack that, spin this, wrapped up
Ice this, ride that, that’s all that they rap about
We act out what we rap ‘bout, no max out on that crack route
‘Cause with Christ back it’s Beyoncé – Super Bowl blackout
Can we hear a song that raise the cross in it? No gun bars and all the floss in it?
With the Lord in it, but it go hard and it’s authentic? Tell the DJ that he knew he been avoiding it

[Chorus – Flame]
They cut on the radio, they say they can’t find me
They cut on the video, they say they can’t find me
DJ, play my song
DJ, play my song
DJ, play my song
DJ, play my song
(Repeat)
