[Verse 1:]
You keep saying
I’m creeping
And I keep explaining for no reason
Cause I’m not cheating

But I’m thinking
Since I go through
What’s the difference if I do, babe?

[Chorus:]
What can I say?
(What can I say?)
You don’t believe me anyway
(Anyway)
I should just cheat on you
(On you)

What (what)
Can I do? (can I do?)
Girl, you keep accusing me
(Oh, you)
I should just cheat on you
(You)

[Verse 2:]
You keep saying you love me
But save it, baby
You don’t trust me

Caught you checking my pager
If I was cheating
I would have erased it
(Tell me, babe, why?)

Must everywhere you go be on the down low?
If you wasn't creeping
Tell me why

If I told you
You’d say it was untrue
I keep denying
Sick of trying
Maybe I should lie to you

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

I should just
I should just cheat on you
I should just
I should just cheat on you
I should just
I should just cheat on you

What you gon’, gon’, gon’ do?

[Bridge x2:]
Please, please, please
How you gonna play me?
Now you gonna make me cheat, cheat, cheat
Got me going crazy
I thought I was your baby

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

Please, please, please
Cheat, cheat, cheat
Got me going crazy
I thought I was your baby
What can I say?
