[Chorus]
Hey, I tell my Shawties bring it back yeah
We in the club and everybody throwing stacks yeah
Whoa, that’s what we doing so exactly
They try to be like me but they can never match me

[Verse 1: Timati]
Whoa, I got so much money
That a girl just can’t say no
The way I roll, the way I flow
The way I dress look at my clothes
That’s American express I hold
Make all the ladies getting posed
Show they ass, show they breast
Girl say no, I say yes
I don’t get up off the club
Unless I be with 2 or 3 or them
Hale Berry, J Lo’s
All want me to sleep with them
Each know it’s Timati, bitch
Who you thought it was?
I’m the man in every country
Every state and every club

[Chorus]
Hey, I tell my Shawties bring it back yeah
We in the club and everybody throwing stacks yeah
Whoa, that’s what we doing so exactly
They try to be like me but they can never match me
Yeah, yeah, they can never match me, match me
Yeah, yeah, they can never match me, match me
Yeah, yeah, they can never match me, match me
Cause I made it up fast, went from shit to flash yeah

[Verse 2: J-Son]
You’re too sexy to be fronting, girl you know you vodking
All these niggas in here got you money yeah we stunting
Brawlers popping bottles, then they popping models
Girl just open and say a, now you gotta swallow

Right, the club is [?] tonight if you see what you like
Don’t be out here acting shy
Just go and get stupid, loose your brain
And get crazy

[Chorus]
Hey, I tell my Shawties bring it back yeah
We in the club and everybody throwing stacks yeah
Whoa, that’s what we doing so exactly
They try to be like me but they can never match me
Yeah, yeah, they can never match me, match me
Yeah, yeah, they can never match me, match me
Yeah, yeah, they can never match me, match me
Cause I made it up fast, went from shit to flash yeah

[Bridge]
The night will go, loose control and let it go
Free your soul and let it go, loose control and let it go, yeah
If you ain’t came here have a good time, what you come for?
You ain’t came here to get fucked up, what you come for?
You ain’t gonna leave with somebody, what you come for?
You ain’t came to the club to party, what you come for?

[Chorus]
Hey, I tell my Shawties bring it back yeah
We in the club and everybody throwing stacks yeah
Whoa, that’s what we doing so exactly
They try to be like me but they can never match me
They can never match me
