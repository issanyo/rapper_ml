[Intro]
Memories is such a beautiful thing
I don't wanna take ’em for granted
So let me reminisce for a minute
Ya'll reminisce with me
Let's see if you all remember this
Let’s go

[Verse 1]
Remember when we youngins'?
Before we ever knew we was poor?
Six of us in the bed, others sleep on the floor
Remember Leave It To Beaver and hide and go seek?
Three Stooges, late night, that was all we was doin'
Remember Hawaiian Silky and the S-curl?
To get them naps out, that was our back route
Remember you might get killed for a starter coat
A starter hat, that's where them snap-backs started at
Yeah, I remember knockin' on doors and runnin', was all in the name of fun, we just had to be into somethin'
Remember, I remember truth and dare with the homies, things happened that I probably shouldn't share with you homie
I remember though

[Hook - J.R.]
Do you remember way back when?
All those crazy things happened
We were young, we was fun
Said some things and some things got done, yeah
And I ain’t seen you all in so long
But I promise I’ma hold on
To the memories way back when
Way back, way back when

[Verse 2]
Remember British nights?
Ladies and college bros
Jodeci boots were poppin'
Remember nineties clothes?
Who had a pair of bibs, cross colored, I guess
Either a Turkish chain, a hair and bone on your neck
(Fellas, there’s a jealous girl in our town)
Music by ABC
Poison by BBD
SWV had every girl weak in the knees
Whatever group we was on, listenin' to R&B
Them paper food stamps, boy that was way back
Your mom would say, "Go spend a penny and bring some change back"
Boy, I remember havin' fun on the block but anybody momma allowed to whip your but on the block
I remember though

[Hook - J.R.]
Do you remember way back when?
All those crazy things happened
We were young, we was fun
Said some things and some things got done, yeah
And I ain't seen you all in so long
But I promise I’ma hold on
To the memories way back when
Way back, way back when

[Verse 3]
Remember?
Today was a good day, them was good days
Watchin' Cube in the drop as he would switch lanes
Cut off khakis, a Jerry curl and tube socks
When every video we watched was on a jukebox
Forget a cellphone, we had a page on
And when it beeped we had a quarter for the payphone
Remember watchin' Good Times what it done for you?
We can't lie, we all wanted to be a Huxtable
Remember Boyz N The Hood put the block on the map?
And how it felt when Ricky ran and got shot in the back?
So many things to remember, I'm just thankful to God
'Cause what we've seen and what we've been has made us who we are

[Bridge] x2
Yes, I remember
Yes, I remember
Yes, I remember
I remember way back when (way back when)
I remember way back when (way back when)

[Hook - J.R.]
Do you remember way back when?
All those crazy things happened
We were young, we was fun
Said some things and some things got done, yeah
And I ain't seen you all in so long
But I promise I'ma hold on
To the memories way back when
Way back, way back when

[Outro] x2
Yes, I remember
Yes, I remember
Yes, I remember
I remember way back when (way back when)
I remember way back when (way back when)
