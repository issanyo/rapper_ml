Verse

Braille can’t see it but you can feel it
Vocals paint you the image of what life is for Christian
My growing pains they been evident
I don’t speak from the past they still here in the present tense
So what your life like?
Is it Christ-like then you’ll suffer with me and that’s the right type
Get the message got believers on my mailing list
The same but read different like we Fahrenheit and Celsius
Was blind but now I HD see it that’s a clear view
Learning from my past that’s why I’m staring through my rear view
Dents in my armor dings in my helmet
Scars in my shoes don’t mean I’m a failure
Just means I’m at war though we fall and we fail
We touch and we feel yea welcome to braille
I wanna give His world view through my experience
And pray my words lead you to HIM in the end period
Cross still on my back
I refuse to drop it
I’m carrying this T because the truth is still the topic
Boy his life it was given that’s why I am living
Ain’t tripping I was blind now I got 20/20 vision lets go

Chorus

Can’t see but believe it
Believing got me seeing I’m certain that my faith is true
This music that we making can’t see it but you feel it and thats what its suppose to do x2
