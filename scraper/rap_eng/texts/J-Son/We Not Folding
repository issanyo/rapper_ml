We ain't folding
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
Bring the rain, bring the pain, bring it on
But you know we won't fold

Feel me
Christians see we enlisted like the navy boy
I'm gone, I'm off my walker
Look at you, you can keep your Lazy Boy
Feel the pressure on me
Trying to break me, trying to block me
It won't budge me, it won't move me
Cause the Rock I know He got me
We go hard or go home all day
Is you with me?
And that there ain't just a song by Lecrae
Do you get me?
And I got my text right with me
Like a toaster right beside me
I'll be moving by the Spirit
So they say I be ghost riding
Rattle up, low rider
You ain't know I am not strong
L-Losing my mind, I'll be riding with my top gone
Strengthened by his power
By his power I am strengthened
Cause it's not the fastest swiftest but enduring to the end
So when the rain's on us
R-Rain's on us throw us hard
And the pain's on us, p-pain's on us go hard
We afflicted but not crush
We persecuted not forsaken
We struck down but not destroy
This j-just one thing that I'm saying

We ain't folding
Cause we don't think you'll win it
But when that pressure's on us
Our powers now within Him
Enlisted as them soldiers
We will not commit treason
So when the pressure's on us
We fighting we not leaving, believe me
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
Bring the rain, bring the pain, bring it on
But you know we won't fold

Okay okay now let me let y'all know what time it is
Okay okay now let me let y'all know what time it is
Okay okay now let me let y'all know what time it is
Okay okay now let me let y'all know what time it is

Oh no here we go for anybody who just wanna let go, wanna give in
Look at him now look towards us no we ain't folding
We keep it going 'cause Jesus holding us down
Been through some trials now listen to how this sounds
House been on the auction block
Truck been repo'd
Feels like I've got my chain and my bike stole, Deebo
That's just a peep hole
I don't wanna get too deep though
Just know, I won't fall
I'll rise cause he rose
I know it's something when that rain and that thunder hits
Some of us get to wonder when the joys gonna come again
That's when I'm getting and flipping to John 10:10
Tell the thief get back he won't get back
He's so w-whack, he won't win
See the roll block?
We don't even stop
Press the gas go fast
Mountain move or get smashed
Big rock, small pebble
Big God, small devil

We ain't folding
Cause we don't think you'll win it
But when that pressure's on us
Our powers power to him
Enlisted as them soldiers
We will not commit treason
So when the pressure's on us
We fighting without leaving believe me
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
Bring the rain, bring the pain, bring it on
But you know we won't fold

Okay okay now let me let y'all know what time it is
Okay okay now let me let y'all know what time it is
Okay okay now let me let y'all know what time it is
Okay okay now let me let y'all know what time it is

We ain't folding
Cause we don't think you'll win it
But when that pressure's on us
Our powers power to him
Enlisted as them soldiers
We will not commit treason
So when the pressure's on us
We fighting without leaving believe me
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
We ain't folding
Bring the rain, bring the pain, bring it on
But you know we won't fold
