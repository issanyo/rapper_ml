[Verse 1: S.O.]
On the Completeness of the Death of Christ:
I'm talking bout the Master who was massacred/ killed by non pacifists/
Read the Lord’s passion it's/ real I’m so passionate/ can't keep it in the cabinet/
Keeping it going spitting strong 16s seem inadequate/
I’m speaking on the depths of His death/
See the tone of the atonement was to rescue and yet/
There are various components that I rest and inspect/
I promote it not demote it, do you get I am kept?/ because He saves/
I’m calling saints/ now let’s bask in His holy ways and know His grace/
Since He died we are justified fully so we praise Him/
Father’s wrath is satisfied sanctified and changing/
Complete in Adonai pray to never cave in/
Gets deep forever God perfect love is fragrant/
Created, He made us and saves us see His patience/
Unchanging and gracious His love is so amazing!

[Verse 2: J’Son]
On the Completeness of Scripture:
Every time you put your face in the text/
It’s God breathed how does it feel inhaling his breath/ it’s Alive
When we’re talking the word were talking sufficiency/
From wisdom-literature, psalms, prophets, gospel to history/
There’s no book in the world to compare the word with
Divinely inspired & He divinely persevered it/
Complete when the canon was closed let me help you through it/
Don’t be confused there’s simply just no more adding to it/
It’s true it’s profitable for rebuke & correction
Equips us for every good work while purging our imperfections/
Ohh yes it’s a blessing & display of his grace/
He used the Word as a portrait so we could see his face/
But Wait!/ His words will pierce through your souls, sharp/
With divine precision getting rid of your old heart/
Our minds are filled with it but skeptics can’t deal with it/
Still it’s amazing that God can be revealed in it!

[Verse 3: Stephen the Levite]
On the Completeness of the Church for Missions:
The church is complete in Him, you can’t compete with him/
So keep your strength because if you beef with her then you beef with Him/
And He defeats contenders, beats contentious little weak pretenders/
With secret agendas for the legal tender//
It ain’t that secret is it, sorry its hard for me to keep attentive/
I’m speaking on how Jesus completes the Christian/
Better yet, how the church is complete for mission/
She will see it’s ending, it’s a promise that you’ve probably seen in Scripture//
And this may seem offensive/
But representation from your missions board or organization may not be attending/
She doesn’t need your business, her shepherd is Jesus and she’s been gifted/
With pastors, teachers and others lead equippers

[Verse 4: Hazakim]
On the Completeness of Sanctification in Glorification:
Tony:
(Yo!) In sanctification only the Most can boast/ (So) We thank and we praise Him, He’s holy, kadosh, kadosh/ Cus there’s no merit in us, it’s the work of God’s Spirit in us/
Making us the Son of God’s mirror image/ He carried the crossbeam for Adam’s rebellious offspring/ To die as a vicarious offering/ He did it – Golgotha Hill, Submitted to the Father’s will/ He’ll finish what He started ’til/ We’re with Him and it’s all fulfilled/
Mike::
Immediately after this we’ll be where our Master is/ (Heaven) True peace & happiness where we will see Him as He is/ (present) It’s just a glass that’s dim where we battle with sin and regret it/ Yet it’s cast to the wind when we’re alas with Him in His presence/ Never alone – dying and crying behind us/ The brightest of robes – Shekinah shining like diamonds in Shamayim of Gold/ Excited, invited we’re like the Messiah enthroned/ We’re finally home/

[Verse 5: God’s Servant]
On the Completeness of Marriage:
Ay yo, completely complete we, truly and deeply
Have moved from the two to a unit that chiefly
Provides us a picture of union that’s sweetly
Profound and it’s found through the Church and her Kingly
Husband, who loves them, died, it was rugged
But rides for His bride to provide her a covenant
Marriage is firstly a picture of mercy
That God would commit to a people unworthy
This bind’s not the kind that our sin could abolish
Cause no, His involvement is kept by His promise
And so, the pleasure and bond of the friendship-
How grand is the standard that’s standing till death splits!
Vile and we’re wretched, and while that’s correct
This God has desires, and kind to express it
In marriage… though it’s temporary and ends
In glory we’re forever together married to Him

[Verse 6: shai linne]
On the Completeness of the Father’s Plan in Christ
God’s will is the deepest, reveals this completeness
The whole Bible finds its fulfillment in Jesus
From the battles and fights to the tabernacle sacrifice
Where the cattle was sliced, it’s all shadows and types
That point to Jesus Christ like an index finger
The Best King of love who removed death’s stinger
The cross is the pinnacle of God’s revelation
Defeated death and Satan bringing cosmic restoration
The resurrection proved the honesty of every statement
In Christ everything that God promised is yes and amen!
Your mind spinning, soon the bottom of the ninth inning
When it all comes together in Christ- No John Lennon!

[Verse 7: timothy brindle]
On the Completeness of Joy in Christ
(Christ) delighted in God before He was a boy/
Became human to give us His completeness of Joy/
For the best pleasure the elect have been predestined/
Secured by the Lord in His death and resurrection/
‘cause Psalm 16 was Your prayer to the Father/
Fullness of Joy, You inherit for all the: co-heirs of Your God
Since You were bearing the Cost, by Your merits and Cross, now we share in this honor/
He feasts His priests and priestesses (Jer. 31:14)/
With the treats of Jesus’ Obedience/ with Peace that’s complete in sweetnesses/
In ever-increasing completeness and unceasing gifts/
The Fullness of Your Deity and Holiness is completing me/
When my soul is conceiving and beholding all Your Scenery/
Resurrected, from death restored/
At God’s Right Hand–Christ IS His Pleasures forevermore!!!
