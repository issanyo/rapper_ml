Yes I'm an artist but I am not just music/ a voice on a record homie I'm a human/
So let me let you in/ let you see the strain and the hurt and the pain/
Yes it comes with the fame/
But I am not just a artist/
Shout out to all the artists and fan's thats true true to us/
Hello to all the bloggers how you doing reviewers/
You should know that we're human and this voice as you listen/
Is a husband and a father a brother a Christian/
The stage I've been given it ain't gold cause it glitter/
He's just a fake I hit him up he ain't never reply/
Ahh I been gone but not on vacation/
And I get home and wifey has got the baby waiting/
My son he got a game I've been booked for a show/
This is our bread and butter that means I got go/
No and I ain't asking for sympathy/ I'm just asking for grace in prayer remember me/
I'm some of what you hear portions of what you see/
I know I'm an artist but overall I'm me/

No I'm not just music/ a voice on a record homie Im a human/
We we are not just what you hear on a cd I am just me/ Im human/

First it's starts with you ain't really real no more/
You don't be making music people really feel no more/
You use to preach a whole sermon in your songs/
Now you're sounding kind of watered down man what's going on/
Homie I done matured I had so many issues at heart/
Thought that screaming it through art made me better set me apart/
If I never get to make another Rebel/
It's cool that was a season in my life let it settle/
And I'm in a new season growing as a man/
I've been around the world and started my own fam/
I've seen a lot of pain huh I have been through it/
Learned that character's more than the things you know and what you do/
Who you calling illuminati not me/
Got me confused with someone who's not me/
A look my songs don't define me interviews are piece/
So you don't really know me when you see me in the streets/
I'm just human

My ear stay to the streets I hear and I listen/
But it's good we all entitled to our own opinion/
I embrace your critique and I'm open to challenge/
Let there be grace and truth see I can receive it with balance/
I'm not angry or mad know the purpose for real/
Is that you see me as a person I hurt and I feel/
You hit me up I wish I could chop it and build with you/
If I'm honest with my life that's just not a real picture/
So if we come off cocky or arrogant even/
Forgive us we're falling people still growing in Jesus/
The difference is when they like you and think you rhyme tight/
When you fall and grow it's all in the limelight/
