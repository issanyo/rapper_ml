It's alright

Walls are closing in
I know what it's like
To fight when nothing at all
In life seems just going right
Pressure's heavy on you
I'm talking heavy pressure
You look around
And everyone else is doing better
Often you are, you are running but stumbling
Dollars you make, they go out as fast as they're coming in
Man, and you're struggling just to stay afloat
Relating to Peter, it's safer just to stay in the boat
Open the glass cause I'm just too distracted to see
Making no sense on why this stuff just keeps happening to me
The white flags in your head
Ready to wave it
I pray you heard that still voice inside
When you be praying, saying

Lay it all down at His feet
When it makes no sense
It's okay
It's alright
Cause He sees and knows your needs
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
So don't stress
Go to your knees

What son would ask for pie
And his father give him mud
So how much more with the Father in heaven show His love
From every jot and tittle
Things big and small
Every hair on your head
Yeah, He cares for it all
He sees your needs and knows them
From the job that you lose
The car breaking down
Kids giving you blues
So when the weight is on you
Brings you to your knees
Just as where you should be
And cast on Him your needs
That's why the veil was cracked
This wider grace was shown
To give you access
To the king on the throne

Lay it all down at His feet
When it makes no sense
It's okay
It's alright
Cause He sees and knows your needs
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
So don't stress
Go to your knees

All your worries couldn't add a
Single moment to your life
Cause when you worry
You don't trust Him
Turn and run to the light
Don't be anxious
He'll give you peace
That transcends all your strife
He's got amazing plans for you
So run with all your might

It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
Cause He sees and knows your needs
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
So don't stress
Go to your knees

It's alright (oh-woah, oh-woah)
It's alright (oh-woah, oh-woah)
It's alright (oh-woah, oh-woah)
It's alright (oh-woah, oh-woah)

It's alright (oh-woah, oh-woah)
It's alright (oh-woah, oh-woah)
It's alright
