If you wanna take a ride
Gotta learn living life

Hey Mr. Feelgood he back again
That's what they yelling through the city
That I'm handling
I'm holding it down throwin' the signs like I'm a hippie
But I never act all shifty
Like I went and got too busy
For my people's I'm running for something showing we equal
And if somebody said it first I guess that this the sequel
Cause that's how you should live it
That's how you pursue it
Let it flow like fluid I promise you won't loose it

If you wanna take a ride
Go ahead go ahead
Gotta learn living life
Go ahead go ahead

Don't matter who's on top
Together we won't stop
Promise you we will be alright
Gotta learn living life
Go ahead go ahead
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air

Hey Mr. Feelgood I'm back again
I guess I gotta go in a hundred percent
Some is living a lie maybe missing the drive
And so better times wait forever for you to arrive
It's hard enough to deal with critics that categorize
And it's hard to deal with the world how will people survive
That's how you should live it
That's how you pursue it
Let it flow like fluid I promise you won't loose it

If you wanna take a ride
Go ahead go ahead
Gotta learn living life
Go ahead go ahead

Don't matter who's on top
Together we won't stop
Promise you we will be alright
Gotta learn living life
Go ahead go ahead
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air

I can't live to regret it
No, I won't let it
I gotta live it right away
We taking off right now
Never coming down
If you wanna ride with me

Don't matter who's on top
Together we won't stop
Promise you we will be alright
Gotta learn living life
Go ahead go ahead
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
Put em in the air air air air
Hands in the air air air air
