[Hook: K-Drama]
Opposition in my face, trying to play defense
I’m bigger than this dude, this don’t make no sense
I Air Jordan on ‘em
I Air Jordan on ‘em
I Air Jordan on ‘em
I Air Jordan on ‘em

[Verse 1: Thi’sl]
They don’t want it Drama, I bang on these clowns
Slam some truth so heavy on ‘em that it crack the ground
Then bring the rim down, we not backin’ down
When the smoke clears, we standin’, they’re still lookin’ ‘round
The coach done put me in the game so I’m about to clown
When my game off, I got a team to hold me down
Throw your boy J’s all black on ‘em
I’m too big to be Michael so I’ll go Shaq on ‘em

[Verse 2: Json]
See I was weak and feeble, the Holy Ghost he gave me the power forward
And hit the block, posted up like I’m a power forward
And I ain’t backin’ down, I’m refusing to budge
The enemy be tempting me, I ain’t moving a nudge
The Risen Savior took my behavior to the grave with him
Yep I had to die, and Air Jordan when I’m raised with him
Heard what I said, fam?
So tell me how it feels, you’ve been listening to a dead man

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Young Josh]
I Air Jordan on ‘em, they may try to block me
But I push that Rock so can’t nobody stop me
With they trash talk, they try to trip me up
Since I been fixed I’ve been rollin’, I fall he’ll pick me up
My whole team gifted, diverse but unified
Triangle offense homie, Truine, my crew is fly
My Coach draws the plays, yo I just follow through
Playin’ my part straight from the heart, opposition ain’t got a clue

[Verse 4: J. Johnson]
Full court press on, good with the rock, CP
Satan got the box on one on, but he can’t hold me
I give him 33, double that, 66
All in the Hall of Fame stuntin’, shinin’, taking flicks
You think it’s 1 on 5, don’t know I ball with God
Swagger is Jordanesque, didn’t know I could fly
I smell victory when defeat is cookin’
Like Spike Lee I flow, a seasoned vet ???

[Hook x2]

[Verse 5: Derek Minor]
So pimpin’ what it is, take a minute and holla at’cha kin
Unashamed to rep Christ, homie 116
So what I look like, worry about ya hater friends
He elevate me over them, Air Jordan
See come and hit ‘em with Divine, I’m with it, I’ma fall but the Lord protect us all
Say whatever you like whether you wrong or right, but I still got love for y’all
So while you talkin’, we workin’, givin’ truth to the Lord
I can’t see you haters at all, my focus on the cross

[Verse 6: K-Drama]
I Air Jordan on ‘em, I can see myself in the air scorin’ on ‘em
I throw a table in the church, chair soarin’ on ‘em
And like Jesus, I bust a Jeff Gordon on ‘em
I gotta zoom on past
I’m never turning back, made to shine in his face
See Coach Christ on the side, gotta tighten up the lace
And check the ring finger, he the champ, never died
I leveled in the air, the cross with living water out they mouth
