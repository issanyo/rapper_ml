[Verse 1]
If pressure bust pipes, then I’ma crack homes
Too much up on my back bones
That’s wrong, sorry, that’s Ye flow
I’ma switch the pace though, got to put you back on
See often I wanna be them
Wanna be the stars in your sky when I see them
Lord help me see that they’re falling, I’m struggling
Coveting what won’t last through tomorrow

[Hook]
Hands up if you just want the light to shine
And expose what you’re trying to hide, then get your hands up … up
I’m trying to fight for mine
‘Cause I don’t wanna live a life of pride, then get your hands up … up
Like you’re reaching for the sky, up … up
But you ain’t reachin’ for the sky, nah
You can come and fight the “I”
If you don’t wanna live a life of pride, then get your hands up

[Verse 2]
Pride is a beast, and I know it lives inside of me, proof
Fruit reveals the core, I’m just showing the root
Wanting what he has, desire his space
Covet, that’s just pride on display live in HD
Yeah, I ain’t relyin’ on faith
When I ain’t comfortable where God in his grace chose to place me
And it’s evident who’s ruling my residence
When I’m willing to only go where I want him to take me
I won’t be fake, hiding how I feel
Now I’m in his grace, I’m okay with being real
Mask off my face they look and they go "ewww”
‘Cause they don’t see the beauty that’s revealed
I ain’t great but I’m saying that he is
So I’m saying that I’m safe, I’m saved and I’m his
I pray the listener will get it right
I’m getting rid of the darkness by putting this in the light

[Hook]
Hands up if you just want the light to shine
And expose what you’re trying to hide, then get your hands up … up
I’m trying to fight for mine
‘Cause I don’t wanna live a life of pride, then get your hands up … up
Like you’re reaching for the sky, up … up
But you ain’t reachin’ for the sky, nah
You can come and fight the “I”
If you don’t wanna live a life of pride, then get your hands up

[Verse 3]
Pride’s at the heart of our depravity
And the Lord saw the tragedy
So sent his Son to raise us up
‘Cause if you notice right now we’re all subject to gravity
Adam had to bite a Apple
‘Cause I find it to be a scary thing
That our heart’s at the Mac show
That “I” come before everything
Who am I to really think that I must
Be exalted, when really I deserve to be crushed?
Homie that’s awful, really I just need to be flushed
‘Cause my heart’s out of order, I need you to touch me
So I’ll esteem my brother above me
And know I am who I am ‘cause I Am loves me
If I’m not living for his glory alone
Then that means I got soli Deo gloria wrong

[Hook]
Hands up if you just want the light to shine
And expose what you’re trying to hide, then get your hands up … up
I’m trying to fight for mine
‘Cause I don’t wanna live a life of pride, then get your hands up … up
Like you’re reaching for the sky, up … up
But you ain’t reachin’ for the sky, nah
You can come and fight the “I”
If you don’t wanna live a life of pride, then get your hands up
