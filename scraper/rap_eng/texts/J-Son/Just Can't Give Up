(Verse 1)
I've been on the grind
Working overtime
Waiting on my time to shine
They all say that they love me
But they all acting funny
Still don't have the money
That I need
Got to stay faithful and grateful for all that you've done
And all that you're gonna do
So I gotta keep going
Gotta keep pushing
Gotta keep moving
'Cuz I just can't give up

(Chorus)
I just can't give up
Oh no
No
No
I just can't give up
Oh no
No
No

(Verse 2)
So how do I get to where I wanna be
Chasing all my dreams
But then I look and see
Where I am now
It don't make any sense
But I know that I can
I gotta get back up again
'Cuz I believe
Sometimes it gets so difficult
Seems impossible
Tryna make it through all of the obstacles
So I gotta keep going
Gotta keep pushing
Gotta keep moving
'Cuz I just can't give up

(Verse 3)
I refuse to give up and I will not break down
Kickstand, I'm leaning up on his grace now
Hands folded, know that I keep my face bowed
And rejecting all applause from the fake crowds
Can't seem to get where I'm going. You know the real reason
I can never live my dreams if I'm still sleeping
So I just grind like never before
And I only choose to move where he tell me to go
Circumstances will hit me
Situations will rock me
Life tryna afflict me
But it will never stop me
Yeah. If I fall, I'ma get up
His strength is in us
So we refusing to give up
