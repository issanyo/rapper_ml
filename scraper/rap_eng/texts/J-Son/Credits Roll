It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
It's over let the credits roll

I got this hurt in my heart I'm feeling from the filth and the pain
It pours fast, it's only rain in my forecast
I'm just buried in guilt
I can't look to your face
I'm rejecting forgiveness
I'm just running from grace
All my mistakes is so heavy I can't carry the load
And I can't see the beyond behind me is crushing my soul
Past feels like the present just can't seem to let it go
Why do I feel indebted when my debt's already paid for, for so

So even when you know it's over
Tell me why you always want to rewind
So much light in front of you
It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em just let 'em roll man
Let 'em just let 'em roll man
Let 'em just let 'em roll man
Let 'em just let 'em roll man

Give me the scraps
I don't deserve to feast from your table
But Christ died for the broken, frail, weak and disabled
Meaning me, so I will not accept the sacrifice
Do I think my righteousness comes in when I'm just acting right? Nahhh
Just believe and confess
And your sins tossed in the sea far as the east from the west
Yes past, present and future
Future, present and past
Adios amigo
All my sins tossed in the trash trash yea

Even when you know it's over
Tell me why you always want to rewind
So much light in front of you
It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
It's over let the credits roll

Why settle for less?
Get off the floor no eating scraps
When it all fails you
You see the joy it did not last
He's prepared a feast for us regardless of our past
So don't get lost
Just keep on following the map

Even when you know it's over
Tell me why you always want to rewind
So much light in front of you
It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
