Christ he backslapped sin and choke slammed death
The real Rock, then he put the grave in a headlock
And they all had to tap out ‘cause it's all been mapped out
The words like Pro Tools, you'll see the whole thing tracked out
But when I say I get it from him, y'all don't hear me though
But trust that's why I wrestle my sin like Rey Mysterio
See Christians should be showing the word closed caption
Why you like a romance comedy, no action
Real Christians please stand up, go'n ‘head and man up
Even if they blam blam us let's stand there like "and what?"
We on lockdown homie, you see them handcuffs?
We run the race with full horsepower, call us a Ram truck

If you riding through the streets
If you nodding to this beat
I hope you see that I'm alive because he died to set me free
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
If you riding through the streets
If you nodding to this beat
I hope you see that I'm alive because he died to set me free
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me

I found out I couldn't save myself all I had was dead words
I died to follow Christ and jumped in the grave head first
See he bled worst, the Rock is divine
Made me a transformer, Optimus Prime
Changed my whole frame up, slayed the grave
And made your boy get low like a razor fade
All that to say he humbled me and daily he will crumble me
Till the day he comes for me making me what he wants to see
I know what want from me, relax yourself
Now add it up, now what you get when you subtract yourself?
I couldn't handle the grave, his wrath was to much trouble
Christ the sacrifice stood in CUT Stunt Double

If you riding through the streets
If you nodding to this beat
I hope you see that I'm alive because he died to set me free
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
If you riding through the streets
If you nodding to this beat
I hope you see that I'm alive because he died to set me free
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me

That's why I spit bars of life, you can get life in these bars
Right now, like you doin' a bid in Riker Island
Got punchlines of truth, ad-libs of his glory
Overdubs of love we spit to give him glory
Look, me ain't my focus my boasting's dead
But I know I'm easy to crush like a loaf of bread
So I rhyme about the blood covered over my head
Took the cross off my neck, it's on my shoulder instead
Your boy dead and I only wanna model Him
All I do is retweet every since I have followed Him
My life homie that's been purchased
Find out that ya boy bleed Christ if you just scratch the surface

If you riding through the streets
If you nodding to this beat
I hope you see that I'm alive because he died to set me free
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
If you riding through the streets
If you nodding to this beat
I hope you see that I'm alive because he died to set me free
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
