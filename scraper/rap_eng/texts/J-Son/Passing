I’m just passing through it this ain’t my home I know it
You gotta go when deaths at your door eviction notice
Yea all Im saying its just a vapor though fading slow
So you can’t stack that paper but can’t take it though
Know its all gonna fall like Rome or that Berlin wall right
So we preach to them all Christ in the dark we them fog lights
Yea we shine see us glistening till that sky is cracked and he splitting it
We all about man his business so we walk it out we be living it
Yea had to leave my old girl she was my main squeeze
Call her cold cold world brain freeze
Now I’m guarding my zone like 2-3
I’m a saint just put a 9 on my back I’m like Drew Brees
I’m just passing but I’m not quarterbacking
See the word was a verb I’m just following his actions
This life it ain’t my own boy we here then we gone
We preach the message till the day he call us home cause we got

Chorus

One shot and then I’m gone cause I’m passing
Run until we reach the throne cause I’m passing
Shake this world on my way home cause I’m passing
Like I’m quarterbacking I’m just passing passing passing passing
Like I’m quarterbacking

Verse 2 (Serge)

A tablespoon of sugar or substitute it for Splenda
Cause I’m tryna shake this world gimme some ice, milk and a blender
Cause I’m passing, I’m dying, but before I head on out
I have to buy a calculator, ‘cause I want my life to count
I’m talking finish my mission, see because I’m a Christian
God and the glorious Gospel should be my only ambition
But sometimes I’m lowercase in different ways that I serve
So CAPS LOCK my heart till all it does is lift up your WORD
And I, will take this Gospel proclaim it to those who hate it
Debate it but some embrace it and accept propitiation
Now we ain’t learning a language, but we still tryna speak lif
Share Christ and be the salt like Lot’s wife
‘cause see if they don’t hear, then how will they believe
So see before we leave, I pray that we would be
The ones to pass it on before we see forever
Jesus strengthen me to labor and to constantly remember I got

Chorus

Verse 3 (K.B.)

Uh I don’t know what know what you heard
But I know that you notice we roll with word
Verily verily heavily versed
And not to be flexin’ our memory
But the opinions are many lets get to this work
What does God say!?
Trust me homie we can talk all day
But degrees & esteem; doesn’t mean that a thing that you think are thoughts of Yahweh/ ah wait…
You might be sincere, but you are sincerely wrong
If your position just isn’t consistent with scripture then it is
Sincerely yours & not Gods so I fight
Enough about what you like to think
What God is what God’s like
We can be wrong anywhere else but on this one we gotta be right
Who is God the Father?
Rappers love to quote his writings/ but i doubt they know the author
So If I play the martyr
Plenty of my fathers been sheep counted for slaughter
To join them would be an honor
Homie You just tell my daughter
That the word of God is worth dying for
Lets His word stand every man be a liar
