[Verse 1: S.O.]
Look, every day I do this every day
And when I wake homie just to set it straight
I say, let us pray for a better way
Father make it sweeter than my wedding cake
I mean, ain't no need for me to medicate
I mean, I can see him through a better way to me
Ain't no make believe, you were made to see, eyes opened wide, read the fakery
Yeah, been wavy you can wave me
Yeah, been Ersul since the 80's
Yeah, all of you could have a baby
Yeah, punked out, looking crazing
Yeah, Not a smile, but my face is clear
For awhile I was made to care
Now I wake up every day, simply thanking God that I made it

It's that uber sauce so bring your plate with you
Main dish'll be the grace given

Wanna catch a wave, come and surf with me
