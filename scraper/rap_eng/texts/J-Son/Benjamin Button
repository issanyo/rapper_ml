[Hook]
You ain’t growin’ up boy, you just gettin’ older
You ain’t growin’ up boy, you just gettin’ older
A boy in a man’s body, you ain’t doin’ nothin’
I know who you is, boy you’re Benjamin Button

[Verse 1]
Grew up as a young ‘un in them city streets
Where the blind leading the blind at
You know what, they die young
But so what, they grow old, not grow up, it’s like a time lapse
But that’s just how it is though
But he don’t wanna die, he just don’t know what it is to live though
‘Cause daddy dipped when he was a kid
He’s still alive but in his heart it’s like he never lived
In hell is hurt, that’s just his pain
At night his mom can’t pay the bills, she prayin’ something change
Gas electric, electric gas
Them the choices that you make when you ain’t got no cash
Tired of asking his momma for stuff he know he can’t have
So he pitchin’ in, he gettin’ it, you can find him out on that Ave
Sleeping with the gorillas, and wrestling with them bears
Average life span’s around 25, around here them boys they don’t care … I’m like

[Hook]
You ain’t growin’ up boy, you just gettin’ older
You ain’t growin’ up boy, you just gettin’ older
A boy in a man’s body, you ain’t doin’ nothin’
I know who you is, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Benjamin Button, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Say you’re Benjamin Button, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Say you’re Benjamin Button, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Say you’re Benjamin Button … you just gettin’ older

[Verse 2]
Grew up as a young girl in them city streets
Where the blind leading the blind at
You know what, they die young
But so what, they grow old, not grow up, it’s like a time lapse
Momma clubbin’, daddy thuggin’, you know what they on
It’s like he here but he gone, but that’s another song
She thinks she grown, she just 16 going on 30
Since daddy left, she vowed “I’ll never let a man hurt me”
Heard me? Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Prada
So she just use a man for a dollar, makin’ him holler
Pretty face, body the flown
Use what she got, get what she want
Just a child raised by a child, momma was just a baby
Having a baby, nobody taught her to be a lady
Now she a baby with a baby, look at how she lived
Full grown, but living like she a kid, gettin’ older

[Hook]
You ain’t growin’ up boy, you just gettin’ older
You ain’t growin’ up boy, you just gettin’ older
A boy in a man’s body, you ain’t doin’ nothin’
I know who you is, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Benjamin Button, Benja-Benjamin Button
Benjamin Button, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Benjamin Button, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Say you’re Benjamin Button … you just gettin’ older

[Bridge]
When you say you’re grown, you ain’t grown ‘cause of timing
It’s ‘cause you put them childish things behind you
When you say you’re grown, you ain’t grown ‘cause of timing
It’s ‘cause you put them childish things behind you
(Repeat)

[Verse 3]
I grew up as a young ‘un in them city streets
Where the blind leading the blind at
You know what, they die young
But so what, they grow old, not grow up, it’s like a time lapse
That’s how it is when every man that you know
In the hood whippin’ good ‘cause he pushin’ that blow
And so we move how he move, man you already know
Till the Lord touched my soul, homie I wasn’t grown, just gettin’ older …

[Hook]
You ain’t growin’ up boy, you just gettin’ older
You ain’t growin’ up boy, you just gettin’ older
A boy in a man’s body, you ain’t doin’ nothin’
I know who you is, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Benjamin Button, Benja-Benjamin Button
Benjamin Button, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Benjamin Button, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Say you’re Benjamin Button … you just gettin’ older
