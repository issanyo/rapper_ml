Runin up to get a naked vext
Chill you wait a couple months till you get sex

If I call her she be on the first right
When I'ma have a baby be my wife
But I wouldn't have that
I can only tap that
Then I send her right back
Wonder you can have that
I run thru ladies like a quarter back pack
So homie you seen me ever giving me that
On the lean, a twist up fillipean
Mixed with african-latin
O'm a brother, know what I mean
Never trick but see for cream
