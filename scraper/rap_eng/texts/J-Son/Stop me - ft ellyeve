I know I need to stop
Before I break his innocent heart
And tear it all apart
Why do I feel this attraction

I know I need to stop
Before I do what I can't undo
'Cause hurting you will hurt me too
So whatever you do just stop me
Whatever you do just stop me

With open arms still I couldn't see
It's like a blast through the past like a memory
Feelings that I couldn't control the archenemy yup
The art's into me yup the heart's real in me

You can hear the melody
And it sounds right my sounds life
Going down a drowned pipe
I chase the love she loves the spotlight

And so I'm in it every night because I love it when we talk right
Love it when we sleep in the studio I fall right to you
I dedicate my whole life to you
Tell me when we change place
You don't have the same face
Forever I will remain chasing

I know I need to stop
Before I break his innocent heart
And I tear it all apart
Why do I feel this attraction

I know I need to stop
Before I do what I can't undo
'Cause hurting you will hurt me too
So whatever you do just stop me
Whatever you do just stop me
Just stop me
Stop me, just stop me

A dark road with a flashlight
Flicking like a trick so it's quick to me how you passed by
Like a flash out the black sky I think different
But I'll stay on our boat until we capsize

Reminiscing upon the passed times
It's like I'm fighting in prison don't know my last crimes
But I just hope that you listened close to my last rhymes
I'm speaking my vision baby I'm passed mimes

Sometimes you hurt me with Mr radio
You say you're in love with me but he don't wanna play me yo
I'm just playing tho I will never let you go
They can barricade the whole road

I know I need to stop
Before I break his innocent heart
And I tear it all apart
Why do I feel this attraction

I know I need to stop
Before I do what I can't undo
'Cause hurting you will hurt me too
Whatever you do just stop me
Whatever you do just stop me
Just stop me
Stop me, just stop me

My lady melody
I can't resist I don't ever wanna stop now
Can't let you get away
And they agree so we're going to the top now

My lady melody
I can't resist I don't ever wanna stop now
Can't let you get away
I would go through fire and storm for us to carry on carry on

I know I need to stop
Before I break his innocent heart
And I tear it all apart
Why do I feel this attraction

I know I need to stop
Before I do what I can't undo
'Cause hurting you will hurt me too
Whatever you do just stop me
Whatever you do just stop me
Just stop me
Stop me, just stop me
