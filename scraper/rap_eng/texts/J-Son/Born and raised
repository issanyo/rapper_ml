Now and then I pace my place
I can't retrace how I got here
I cheat the light to check my face
It's slightly harder than last year

Then all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Cause one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it's such a waste to grow up lonely

I still have dreams, they're not the same
They don't fly as high as they used to
I saw my friend, he's in my head
And he said "You don't remember me do you?"

Then all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Cause one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it's such a waste to grow up lonely

Still got time, still got face
I call on both of my brothers
I got a mom, I got a dad
But they do not have each other

So light on, take your place
Show your face to the morning
Cause one of these days you'll be born and raised
And it all comes on without warning
