This is my heart beat
Can you hear it rhyming?
Pain soaking up tears
I swear my parents crying
Love running from me
That you be some patience
Sit here circumstances
Talk to me situations
Forgive me, I could focus on ugly thoughts
Tends to happen when I don't look to that rugged cross
Or the who's on it who gladly died for this void I'm feeling
What minded in him, he satisfies so I joy is my joy
All of my moments of God to see took me temporary
When I began to think about all of the things you have thrown because you love me
I know that you love me
The weight of this world trying to pull me down
But I think that you without me begin to smile
Joy you bring me joy
You bring me joy
You bring me joy
You are my joy
Momentary, that y'all preparing me for eternal glory
Momentary, that y'all preparing me for eternal glory yea
When pain rush hits you like the wind do
Think we have something angels look into
A great salvation, makes moments still
This great salvation has yet to be revealed
So consider him, who was made perfect
Through suffering and know our pain has the same purpose
Who am I to murmur? Why should I complain?
When you want to whisper
Never said a thing
All of my moments of God to see took me temporary
When I began to think about all of the things you have thrown because you love me
I know that you love me
The weight of this world trying to pull me down
But I think that you without me begin to smile
Joy you bring me joy
You bring me joy
You bring me joy
You are my joy
Momentary, that y'all preparing me for eternal glory
Momentary, that y'all preparing me for eternal glory yea
Affixtures momentary, momentary affixtures
Don't compare to the glory we'll witness
When his holiness hits us and we're blown away
We behold his face and all his pain will be thrown away
Inside the pit, where the story was rolled away
Pretty ain't it? There's no other way to paint it
This for every believer who has choose to trust
In him who endured the pain and a cross who's truly crushed for us
All of my moments of God to see took me temporary
When I began to think about all of the things you have thrown because you love me
I know that you love me
The weight of this world trying to pull me down
But I think that you without me begin to smile
Joy you bring me joy
You bring me joy
You bring me joy
You are my joy
Momentary, that y'all preparing me for eternal glory
Momentary, that y'all preparing me for eternal glory yea
Momentary, that y'all preparing me for eternal glory
Momentary, that y'all preparing me for eternal glory yea
