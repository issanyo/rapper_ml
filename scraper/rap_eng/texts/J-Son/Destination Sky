Spreading my wings
Learning how to fly
You gotta let me go now
Everything's gonna be alright
I'm leaving day spring
Destination sky
Don't worry about me now(me now, me now)
No
Everything's gonna be alright

When my days turned to night times
And my 9 to 5 turned into a life of rhymes
Wings tied so I couldn't see the seasons
Bitterness inside came with many different reasons
I was there bleeding
You readied the first aid, so committed
Still I went and cheated in the worst way
Causing friction our apartment got an earthquake
Screaming why J on the ground with a outbreak
I know I was doing what I shouldn't do
Why I'm myself center, a selfdestructing fool
I couldn't work on our house I had no power tools
I was out cool while you home calling crooked fool
It's hard to repair and fix the pass
When the mirror is all broken you cannot puzzle the glass
Seven years of bad luck
I think I crash
While you spreading your wings, my wing's turning to ash

Spreading my wings
Learning how to fly
You gotta let me go now
Everything's gonna be alright
Leaving day spring
Destination Sky
Don't worry about me now (me now, me now)
No
Everything's gonna be alright
Feel better, feel better for the worse (yeah)
Everything's gonna be alright

Here is a token of appreciation
Gotta oversee emotions to give information
But my oceans of emotion like a fixation
So I gotta tell our story because its liberating
I did everything to be with you
Even put the music aside so you can handle school
Now in my mind I think I didn't do enough
Because that's what you told me
And I guess that I am pitiful
I used to think you need a different man
Because I had my life on pause while you had a plan
I know deep down that I am lost why you understand (?)
Hope god you can see I'm a front man
And with the show comes the crowd too
But our relationship is bad so they all boo
I guess we stressing the performance
No sound check but nobody ever wonders

Spreading my wings
Learning how to fly
You gotta let me go now
Everything's gonna be alright
Leaving day spring
Destination Sky
Don't worry about me now (me now, me now)
No
Everything's gonna be alrigt
Feel better, feel better for the worse (yeah)
Everything's gonna be alright
(Oh yeah)

I wish that I could turn back time
But I can't so I gotta write it down one time
I wish that I could turn back time
But I can't so I fly Destination Sky

I wish that I could turn back time
But I can't so I gotta write it down one time
I wish that I could turn back time
But I can't
Destination Sky

Spreading my wings
Learning how to fly
You gotta let me go now
