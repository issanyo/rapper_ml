Intro:

I don't need, no, I don't need nothing from you
I don't need no...

Hook:

(Ay! Ay!) I feel like I’m soaring, though my body is still low
(Ay! Ay!) My slippers feeling like Jordan's; my Jetta feel like a limo
(Ay! Ay!) I don’t need, no, I don’t need nothing from you
(Ay! Ay!) I don’t need, no, I don’t need nothing from you

[repeat]

Verse 1 (Json):

Yeah, I told 'em we litty; they said that they know
'Cause all of them lights like the Fourth of July
But them just believers and we got the glow
And He makes provision we will not deny

[?]
With grace and favor from a perfect Savior
Took your boy, reshaped him 'for my time was up
No looking back because I know already
Grave was dug, he was a [?] already
He was in it, made it blow confetti
Feel like we winning 'cause we know already

He good, that mean we good
I'm grateful 'cause my plate full
No silver spoon, but we eat good
'Cause He got us, even when I'm to my last dollar
Feeling like there's nothing in my pocket
(I don't need, no, I don't need nothing from you)
Word told me, "Don't worry," boy
Hakkuna Mattata, oh Lord

Verse 2:

Ooooohhh, is this how I’m really living?
Am I dreaming, is it my imagination?
Am I tripping? Are you kidding?
Ooooohh, is this what it feel like to be winning?
I should have been given worse than prison
But now I’m forgiven, are you kidding?

Hallelujah, hallelujah
I was bound to crash, like a bad computer (Ay! Ay!)
Yeah, a sinner in total depravity
Why would Messiah chase after me?
Now I say “bye” to my vanity
This new life is better than fantasy, ohhh

Preacher, preacher on the television
Saying Imma get rich
I don’t get a lot of money
But my plate of food is delish
Got a wife whom I love
And a home that like
And a job that I don’t mind
I don’t even have a smartphone
But I got a joy that you can’t buy
