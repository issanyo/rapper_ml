[Hook – Steve T]
I wake up in the morning feeling brand new
Christ he made me brand new
That’s why I live life brand new
My friends say I act so brand new
I got a brand new life in Christ boy
That’s why you see me walking in the light boy
Purge me with that flame, I been changed
And now my life’s on
Brand new (brand new)
Brand new (brand new)

[Verse 1 – Json]
I’m fresh, see the tag, I’m brand new; brand new, that rare kind
Christ brand, no tattoo; fly fam, no airline
Been made alive, new life boy, new walk boy, new sight boy
I hear them saying “he ain’t the same, he done changed” well that’s right boy
Came through and he take control, hard heart he’ll break that mold
Hole in it, he’ll make that whole; brand new so that glory shows
See the grave, well that’s where I stay, man I’m talking that flat line
Died with him, raised up, that’s right – baptized
Pursued by his love yep I’ve been plugged in by his grace
And I keep his word in me, I’m sh-sh-shining in this place
I was blinded but that faith came in time and just to save
Now you’ll find me gr-gr-grinding for my God who’s just too great
So what we on, that brand new; what we ‘bout, that brand new
Old man can’t stand you, that’s why he’s making me brand new
Head to toe I’m brand new, yep yep I’m a new creature
You can see it in them features, homeboy I’m a believer and I …

[Verse 2 – God’s Servant]
A-yo check it homie, I’m brand new, got switched up from a bad dude
Had a bad heart with bad fruit, and my sin debt was in the past due
But the Lamb … Christ did for me what I can’t do, for sinners got beat
And was hung, now I march to the beat of his drum, got a brand new melody to jam to
Imitator, much more than a borrower, but a follower
I’m remade in him, saved from sin, and I’m filled in him, not hollow dirt
See I used to be one way, no Jesus, needless to say I was dead and was under wrath
Till the God-man came and was slain, and he bled and I said, “hold up, gimme some of that”
See I used to be stained without him, and nope, not feeling the “Jesus thing”
Nah, I was absent-minded, was blind to the shine that Jesus brings
I used to be cool without him, so prone to doubt him, the God of all
Now I holler ‘bout him ‘cause grace came through like a waterfall
So hear what we boast in, it’s not that we’re perfect or living with no sin
But that God in Christ has allotted life and gave hearts so we’re able to know him
So when we say we’re brand new, please know we’re referring to surgery
That God has internally and with certainty prepared us for eternity
