[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Straight to the point
Yo, what's the topic? Here's a summary:
Organizin' priorities
This ain't about money
Clothes, cars, Baggin' honeys
Braggin, or rappin' somethin' funny
It's havin' hope
When consequences got you feelin' crummy
In class, a student didn't pass who studied
Picked on by buddies
Had a question, but yo he's feelin' like a dummy
If he asks
Raise your hand, you shouldn't hesitate to question the man
Whoever said you can't, just know that you can
Explore potential
Watch' you "wanna be," say that "I am."
Pray for the exam
You're [cornered?]
Break out in a jam
Cause all through life, cats'll be hatin' on you
Waitin' for you to fall off
So what I think you should do
Is never sweat 'em or minimize a select circle of brethren
They stole your walkman, but material items
You'll get again
Sometimes you win, but losses can't cause you harm
Pick up where you left off
When the storm is calm

[Hook]
It goes on and on
But never on and off
Stand strong, and never take a pause
It's constant elevation when we aim for the top
[Sampled Lyrics Continue it, forever exist, and never stop.]
It goes on and on
But never on and off
Just cause you gotta break the laws
When you fight the lost cause
Give it all you got
[Sampled Lyrics: Now we in the thick of it, and you don't stop.]

[Verse 2]
Never give up hope
Position your goals and try to cope
Walkin' up a slope, better paths are measured
Study the scope of the endeavor
Clever fellas â€“ they do it together
Foolish brothers are selfish, others jealous
Baby falls and gets up
Would you crawl forever after the knockdown?
Cops surround the block now
Did moms move after the Glock sound?
[Nah], Real responsibility on the plate:
Light bills to pay, food on the table
Now yo ass can play
[That saves?] 9
Hardest job is waitin' in line
Complainin' about the sun that didn't shine
In the winter time, days are shorter
In the desert, one finds water
Young cat saves enough to buy a 4 Track Recorder
Thought a stranger wouldn't help me
Before he opened the door
Cold in the north
But now the speakers heat up the floor
Believe you're worth more
Push on, and stay strong
If you're hungry and motivated
You won't starve for long

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Hey yo, check it:
It's funny how things change
And lifetime controls how the roads rearrange
Soldiers more pain with the [?] in they finest hour
Sailers abandoned at see
Seeks and finds light towers
Signs around us
Desert man grows a patch of flowers
It's pure
Lost dog just showed up at your door
Many ups, many downs
And there'll forever be more
My seesaw timeline starts at '74
Hope helps you endure
Child with deadly disease cured
[?]
[Position?] bottle washed out on shore
Earthquakes in city streets
The speakers heat up the floor
Cause an avalanche
[?]
Was screamin' for more
Hey yo well speakin' of believin'
And the meaning in achievin'
Saw a demon is deceivin
But you're leadin' the marathon
You can travel in the dark
And yeah, you might lose a pawn
I'd rather see you rise
Cause the fall is long

[Hook]

[Outro]
