The concept has attracted swarms of questions and speculations
You've been asking all the questions, may I ask one of you
Ask it, there's no limit on questions here tonight
And on answers?
None that I can think of
This then is the question
The answer is that they are the-
They are the-

I am the answer
I'm the answer
I'm the answer, I'm the answer
I'm the answer
I'm the answer, I'm the answer
I'm the answer
I'm the answer, I'm the answer
I'm the answer
I'm the answer, I'm the answer

[?] For your ear to ear
Eye to eye as I try to be the best on the scene
Ask yourself why
I gots the answer

On the envelope I send around, signed, sealed delivered
Yes my skin is brown, uh uh, that's me, the answer
Yes it's all love, all live
What what, what what what
Check it check it
Check it
Yo you couldn't capture the rapture now we're coming at ya

Ask me no questions
And I'll tell you no lies
You asked me my brother, hear my answer
