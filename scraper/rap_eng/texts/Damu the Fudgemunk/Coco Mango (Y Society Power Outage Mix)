Listerine green jars, sick cleans jalla be a emma
Thick queens, mamma mia robs jalapeno peppers
Click mean large, brick seen mirage is ours
Quick mean cause, strict deen Allah
Make your quota, check your clock shock taqua
Concoct the potion, blue liner lotion, call it aqua
Tock you on watch, sure ahk- salaat tirakat
Four to roll in extorter mode, loose spot too hot
Here you go ma, for you boo, that's coco mango
She let her hang go, her man said "yo no tango"
Bangles jangle, no gangs is tranquil
Blank grill, real shank steel, bankroll ankle
F to the N and R, two thiefs are bummin a car
But never had no beef so Alhamdulillah
Inshallah any duties, top grillers, no Mercedes sign
Bubble nuggets with the ruby, Cop Killer 89
On a line on the third like loop on
Word is a bond that's honored, don shukran... afwan
Ram te ek daan
Livin sunnah of the prophet Muhammad, alahi salaam

[Insight]
Marvelous orchestras summoned the forces of power that orbited us
Dune cloud smoked orifices, Sight endorses what is glorious
Relive the first feelin of euphoria, power is in all of us
Notoriety is notorious, words scatter prefer (????)
Bros mad with first data like a dagger, slice of minimal maestro
A little nice yo, well look at the price though
Smooth rules that ooze as few as complex chemistry
And bitch and use and fizz and use with rhythms of recipe
Lesser fuse the energy to increase equity
So cinematic thoughts create a beautiful entity, envelope telepathy
And freaks the format, chop your garbage into 4-track
Recorded more facts to a stack
Only pour the pure tour back later
Years ago I stopped checkin for anyone on a major
I smack a hater with a tractor trailer use a paper
