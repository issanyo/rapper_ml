[Verse 1]
I started out without a doubt in my mind
Destined to define life through my passion
At night I would practice
Sacrifices were massive bad guys get that ass kicked
Artists that influenced me back then now classic
Ripped plastic from cassettes that I looked forward to rock Instead of spending on lunch money was stored in a box
Recording in spots on tape without talking
I paused beats together into loops with radio shack walkmans
Using this process went on for a while
After years of recording I started forming my style
Sorta wild now styles sound when I look back
All the scratches that I practiced on turntables thats whacked able to ask questions later hate a manual instructions later
An innovator illustrating others still are waiting
Picture painting is poetry entertaining
You know its me celebrating a generation of elevation
My fascination past imagination outlasted my patience
At the same time I'd wind up in crazy situations
Does it pay son? all the dedication devastation
Never celebrations several collaborations since day one
Things complex as contracts and concepts
Contacts complete ninety percent of the game
Cherish the moment success and the fame
Because times change and things may never be the same

[Verse 2]
When I had no responsibilities and innocence was still in me
Curious and physically increasing my agility
Everything was possible and nothing too illogical
Comic books were comical the science psychological
Days passed fast after class was playtime
Didn't have to pay fines or sign the dotted line
Designing art wasn't important or criticized
A kid that size had a great imagination
Later fascination revolves around products you purchase
If I knew then then what I know now, I'd rework it
Cause everything you do do gain experience from
Whether you know it or not. Your controlling the plot
Holding a Glock sounds stupid but it sure fit the format
Came a long way since analog four tracks
Never had dough and always tried to maintain
But I respect good times, some thingsÂ´ll never be the same

[Verse 3]
I remember the weather wherever I was walking
Playing my realistic walk man. Everybody could hear it
Music I'd wear it people talking knew its part of my spirit
At that age when the world had more pages of amazement
Unsolved equations shaping dreams into a miracle
The ruff edged world seems much less spherical
Spiritual science lost a little mystique for kids in the street
Who suffer everyday with little to eat
Some people always have it worst so do the best where you at Adjust to the math and invest in the potential you have
When you lack any commitment practice all positions
When you're older you feel the impact of small decisions
Developing the brain always measure the aim
Feeling pleasant in the present, things could never be the same
