[Intro: Flex Matthews]
I'm getting tired so I gotta sleep

[Verse: Sample: [?]]
You're an irresponsible, lazy, no good bum
And everybody thinks that you're a fool
You'll never make the big time
You won't be anyone
And everybody wonders what you'll do
You're a dreamer (That's true)
With your head up in the clouds
You're a dreamer
We think you're copping out
How can you waste your life
To put it bluntly we think you're a jerk
And the family thinks that you ought to go to work
You're a dreamer with your head up in the clouds
You're a dreamer and we think you're copping out
