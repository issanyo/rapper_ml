Peep the pattern of speech see i´m rather unique having
Talent and success seems like a challenging feat groups you
Gradually see as the formula fades out i
Hold now highly concentrated concoctions
Conception perplex profound composition
All opposition i positioned in factories
Assembly line for a freestyle faculty the
First catastrophe completed a copycat
Rap face assembled get a frowning jaw with a
Fitted cap placed by a mechanical claw
Fans at the door more patient for replacements
Makeshift productions a continuous campaign
Synthetic sound waves simultaneously scanned brains
Out of the norm brain storms are electrocuted my
Memory could not be rebooted when executed the
Assembly line moves with the sound of a snare drum i can
Hear whats going on with an enhanced eardrum
Machines put together a robotic radical
Identical intelligence assembled in attitudes
Pathological lier chips comfortable capital
What will the masses do when they find out about a
Defect rejects they detect and eject it almost
Happened to me but i was fast on my feet and i´m
Composed of material thats rather unique

Scratch/ rather unique ///

With comparable speech various matters to reach creatively
Free commit to any challenge i seek such as encouraging
Children or expressing a notion e-
Motion is a factor fulfilling fractions of the potion actions
Start explosions my raps lotion master focus surpass
Jokers trying to kill the vibes hopeless, you know this more
For less quality in store the best is for you rapping
Producing and scratching (p) methods i use Don´t look con
Fused 
I Did it all before I knew that I could, Still always
Talk to you directly never play Mr. Hollywood
(p) cats doo doo acting too new screw you
True blue soon uma sue you, music voodoo

Travel and unravel a colossal composition with
Original renditions i deliver with conviction (*) when I per
Form for the PUBLIC, i make sure that you LOVE IT kick a
Freestyle I CRUSHED IT Mille Vannille BUSTED I
Adjusted to the vibe change pitch to fit
Tac´tics back flipped-switched to the side now (*) stay
Calm ill consistently deliver the goods when your
Living in the hood your always misunderstood ill mix a
Session in my sleep and write an album a week complete a
Catalog of beats respect whoever competes if you could
Beat me in the challenge then I gather you cheat son i´m
From the virgin islands and i´m rather unique
