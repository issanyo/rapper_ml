[Verse 1 - Sage]
Lie and say I'm not dope
Swerving into potholes
Blasting XVII and
Me and Kenja eating nachos
Jean Claude Van damn
I'm that nigga though
Eating chicken liver
Making bitches hit the figaro
Pit my foes to listen to a nigga
Hit the Jigga flow
1996 on bitches, Giggle Gang shit is cold
Raw tip to my lips real nigga code
Keep my shit on toast
Making sure all of these niggas know
These pie niggas need a dollop of the Cool Whip
First advance check, Ima buy my moms a new whip
Pretty women in my new crib and they do strip
Down to their undergarments and it's so foolish
Rob Kevin Dre Dalvin Franco & Romil
Chris April Kurb Kenja Deon who I'm cool with
Y'all thinking that's hot?
Just wait on that new shit
Said I couldn't flow but now I ain't got shit to prove bitch

[Hook - Kevin Abstract & Sage]
La, La, La
La, La, La, La
Na-nah, Na-nah, Nah
ASF Hoodies is what we swagging in
Traveling, plus you know
We checking extra baggage in
Crashing in hotels
Macking, bruh you so Dell
Niggas wanna hate? What we say? Shit
Oh Well

[Verse 2 - MiC Kurb]
Let me tell you how it is
In my lifetime
Let me tell you how I feel
When I write rhymes
Sitting back with my backpack
Strapped and attached to my heart
Other memories and timelines
Not mine, but another brother's
What the fuck is
This, you may ask, cause I'm
Loving someone else's lover
Cause my spirit wasn't mine to begin with
Two souls cross, they
Experience a friendship
Never mentioned
That I wasn't blessed with a life
I was left with another brother's dreams
I'mma tell you what it means to be outside
Gonna be a long ride
So peep it if you haven't seen
My eternity is certainly
Certain as I exist
I cease to repeat, then another one begins
When my soul is someone else's
And I start to reminisce
They will feel it, and they'll prolly make
A song like this, you dig?

[Hook - Kevin Abstract & Sage]

[Verse 3 - Kevin Abstract]
It seems like
The whole world hates you
Everybody wanna
Act like they made you
You can't save me
I save you
You can't watch me
This ain't pay-per-view
Is this a dream?
A Deja Vu?
Wanna come through
In a Coupe '92
Impala blue
And we gon' be bumping
Something that's new
It goes like la, da, da
La, da, da
That's all I want
Can't even front
A nigga wanna stunt
I can't lie, dog
Shit
Yeah, it seems
Microphone, tight jeans
And I bleed
Greatness on the track
So all them
Haters can call me wack
You can take a step back
