[Hook]
So cry when you hold me, I'm outside
Take a piece of the motion to roll with
It's alright
So ay, ay, it's okay
So ay, ay, ay, hey, it's all okay

[Verse 1]
And pray for mom's son
I've been holding my pain for some time
I been trying to catch what you sayin'
And your brain's stuck in the past
And my past was stuck in my locker
And the world was stuck in my locker
And I felt the world with my shoes
And you called me right after school
And you told me bang with them dudes
With the same dude that they shot down
With the same dude that ran my block now
When the whole block's still hot for the right now
Never seen a nigga with a Glock now
'Til you see that nigga turn around
With the lock down
Never see the
Never see the
Never see the
Never see the
Touch, 'bout to bang still

Answer dem
Damage feels
Damn it's near, I could feel it though
Might turn around and run it though
Damn it's here and I don't feel it though
I need a moment, gotta let it go

[Hook]
So cry when you hold me, I'm outside
Take a piece of the motion to roll with
It's alright
So ay, ay, it's okay
So ay, ay, ay, hey, it's all okay
Okay

[Bridge]
I wanna fall from the sky with no parachute
If I fell super high would you be scared to move
I take time with my days and my dad sleep
'Cause my parents only ones who don't believe in me
Run away
(Don't go back)
Keep it under wraps
(Better pack my bags)
What you gotta say
(Don't hold back
I done fell off track tryna keep up with the past)

[Hook]
So cry when you hold me, I'm outside
Take a piece of the motion to roll with
It's alright
So ay, ay, it's okay
So ay, ay, ay, hey, it's all okay
Okay

[Outro]
And watch it burn, I can't run
Don't let the world run from ya, I can't run
Don't let the world burn from ya, I can't earn
Oh no, no
And watch it burn, I can't run
Don't let the world run from ya, I can't run
Don't let the world burn from ya, I can't earn
