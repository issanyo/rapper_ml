[Verse]
Who the fuck is you talking shit about my husband
Y'all niggas don't want it, been hustling since I was youngin'
Let the money pile in, baby boy gon' get his dollars right
If he don't, I'ma rob every single mothafuckin' white person
In this dumb ass boring suburb
What the fuck make you think, what the fuck make you think
Your son deserves that shit more than he do (mothafucka)
You don't know the shit my niggas been through
And if I (It's westside in this mothafucka)
And if I try to tell you would you even
(What the fuck make you think we ain't sick)
I feel like nobody listening to me (What the fuck make you think?)
I'm sitting at the bottom of this bleacher
But nobody even listening to me
(That shit, that ain't cool
Don't try that shit 'round me, that ain't cool nigga
What the fuck make you think) (So fuck you, so fuck you)
Bitch, that's word from my... so we all say

[Bridge]
Fuck you, and that's word from a bitch like me
(That's mothafuckin word)
And fuck you, that's word from a nigga like me
(That's word, that's mothafuckin word)
Mothafuckin' fuck you
And that's word from a bitch like me
That's mothafuckin word mothafucka
And mothafucka fuck you (All this mothafuckin' pride, bitch)
That's word from a nigga like me
Westside in this mothafucka bitch (Westside in this mothafucka)
I feel good motha-

[Chorus]
Why aintchu calling
Take a step back and force me to be who you want me to be
Why aintchu calling
Take a, take a step back
(This exactly who I'm supposed to be)
And make me and force me, make me breathe how  you want
(I ain't sorry bout shit)
Why aintchu calling
(This exactly who I'm supposed to be)
Take a step back and force me to be who you want me to be
(Mothafuckas)
(This is me)
The righteous calling
(I like doing everything I do, so fuck you, from me)
Take a step back and make me breathe how you want me to
Everyday my birthday bitch
(This exactly who I'm supposed to be
Ain't no sorry from me nigga)
What ain'tchu calling
(I fuck with me)
(This exactly who I'm supposed to be
And I ain't sorry 'bout shit mothafucka)

[Outro]
And westside, yell that shit as we walk out this mothafucka
I like doing what I like doing nigga
Say that shit with pride and all
You can't take shit away from me
