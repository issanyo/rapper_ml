[Hook]
And all she ever wanted was a nigga she could die with
And all I ever wanted was a soldier I can ride with
Hit me on my telephone
Get me with my young day light roll
'Til you see my mind is on it's own
Then we wake up, in Silicon Valley

[Verse]
Who these red walls made for
Who the reason why my red eyes take off
It's all the same thing, I need a chain and a necklace
It's a fire down in Texas, had sex in a Lexus
In a dream I had the other night
I swear another lullaby, if I gotta testify
Damn, I swear to God I'm aiming high
I never plan to score some dope
I'd rather jump my brother's rope
And find ways to give you hope so
If I gotta clench my throat in hopes of never going broke
Damn, I'm already there
Can you feel it in the air?
My Phil Collins cassette is cracked fucked up, and kinda unplayable
They say I'm unsaveable, and kinda unstabable, it's all a bunch of bull
Reminds me of a fabable, damn
They want me ripped up, torn up and put in a casket
Wake up you bastards my whole life is a classic
Damn

[Hook]
And all she ever wanted was a nigga she could die with
And all I ever wanted was a soldier I can ride with
Hit me on my telephone
Get me with my young day light roll
'Til you see my mind is on it's own
Then we wake up, in Silicon Valley
