[Verse 1: Allan Kingdom]
I'm finessing
On from the coat check section to the -
Attention I got nothing to say!
Attention but they like what they see
Why they looking at we?
I'm in my seat
They say they run the town
They ain't popping to me
This a bonus, hit the floor
Then the party is we
I'm the nigga
I'm the coldest
I'm not underneath
That's an anomaly
Take it or just leave it I guess..
Just check out the freedom I get!
They don't need Tequila
Just a kilo - of my set
How they heave and can't breathe
In our vicinity
She got natural hair
And do the
Stare, and choose the
Team of the year and future
Hallelujah, hands in the air
And do that
Just mooch up, the roof up
And put your cups of
Hennessy, and your tree
Where they gotta be!

[Chorus: Allan Kingdom]
Is you with the shits?
They're like damn cause these harmonies bliss
They're like damn cause these already hits
I'm like damn guess I'm already lit
Guess I'm already lit
They're like is he with the shits?
They're like damn cause these harmonies bliss
They're like damn cause these already hits
I'm like damn guess I'm already lit
Guess I'm already lit

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Hi, goodbye
I believe my shorty gone
She left right after that bong rip
She gone dog ya sorry
Tonight, my guy
Your friends can tag a long
It's only right I'm off this
Off the shits I feel awesome boy
Who is that now?
Cousin G got the weed by the pound
Cousin D got the lean by the ounce!
Kingdom only brought me for the sound
But I feel so right, tonight
My face melting to the ground
How the fuck did I end up in a gown
Got me pacing around town
And I'm looking for my prototype
Ohhh ohh oh

[Chorus: Allan Kingdom]
Is you with the shits?
They're like damn cause these harmonies bliss
They're like damn cause these already hits
I'm like damn guess I'm already lit
Guess I'm already lit
They're like is he with the shits?
They're like damn cause these harmonies bliss
They're like damn cause these already hits
I'm like damn guess I'm already lit
Guess I'm already lit

[Verse 3: Allan Kingdom]
You can't pretend to be dope
Came in with my crew, you'll remember me though
When I hit the door cause the women be gone
Turned the party cool on my enemies though heyy!
Ladies feeling on my dudes cause their
Feelings be strong
Female opportunities heavily flow
Sailing to our boots like the liberty though!
Diggidy dope
Biggidy boss
Walking like I own it now didn't you know?!
If you stunting more know you're pretty below!
And the more you ignore me you're feeling me though
Bigger than the Beatles
That's what we hope
When the sun gotta run
Making symphonies though!
If we hit the function it's gonna be cold
Now you get a glimpse of something
You've heard of me though!
Heyyy!

[Chorus: Allan Kingdom]
Is you with the shits?
They're like damn cause these harmonies bliss
They're like damn cause these already hits
I'm like damn guess I'm already lit
Guess I'm already lit
They're like is he with the shits?
They're like damn cause these harmonies bliss
They're like damn cause these already hits
I'm like damn guess I'm already lit
Guess I'm already lit
