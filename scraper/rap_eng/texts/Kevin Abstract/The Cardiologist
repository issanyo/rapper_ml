[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Zonin' off melatonin
Shit got me fucking goin'
Thinking of hearts I've molded, then the delicate one I'm now holding
Fix the shells that are broken, they say my hands were golden
But these gloves are blood-stained
I feel like a monster watching them open up, 'til I seal all of these cuts
It's a race against time and sometimes I'm not fast enough
You win some, you lose some, they say
Though the stakes get raised when a life is put in the way
Don't know why I choose to play
Wanted to be a hero
Didn't figure what life is like working at ground zero
Mama told me that God has his eye on the sparrow
But what about us, the mere mortals?
Medicated to a portal of an apathetic shell
The surface handles well, but I need a cardiologist so I can feel myself
Started with insomnia, now my mind's on the rim
Spiraling towards oxy's, opiates, and some kolonopin

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Dom McLennon]
I'm just trying to change my ways, my ways, my ways
But it just stays the same like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
I'm just trying to change my ways, my ways, my ways, my ways
But it just stays the same like a heartbeat
Llike a heartbeat, like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat, baby
Gotta start deciding

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
They say greed is evil, but depression is a modern sin
Mind racing, not sure if it's the beginning or end
Of my thoughts, going a mile a minute
Tryin' to change how I'm living
But can't make stable decisions
Mind edgin' at the point of tippin'
'Til it's time for work, I gotta be a slate
And this apathy and numbness makes me perform great
I'm praised for these calculations that I've been forced to make
By keeping myself rational inside of a sedated state
So around and around we go, the vicious cycle
My service is a favor and these people feel entitled
A sole responsibility, just to perform
Don't know why my heroics turned to contemplations, I'm torn
No man can be a god, I don't deserve to play it
Looking at these patients, EKG is losing patience
There's a party in my head and they're pissing in the basement
Emotions I've repressed begin to show their ugly faces
It's nails on the chalkboard of my sanity, scraping
Up my empathy, maestro of life, creating symphonies
Upon the epiphany, the human condition ain't worth conditioning
Cause nobody is listening
Self prognosis, beyond me
A bit of addiction tossed in with DID
Sorry to say, just a product of a society
Compliantly using our anxiety
As a means for addiction, you fit the description
Come take the prescription, we promise to fix this
But I'm part of the business, so riddle me this
What does a man with both hands tied behind his convictions
Do to perform surgery?
If he does it for others, I hope that shit work for me

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
I say, oh, can you hear me?
Can you see me?
I say, ooh, can you hear me?
Can you see me?
Ah, ain't no
Ah-ah, ain't no
Oh, yeah, ain't no
Ain't no

[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
The room is closing in and I can barely breathe
The red on the walls will never let me leave
The man behind the wall will never let me down
And there's been moments I was hoping you would still be 'round
I can be a really shitty time for you to pass these out
To all your patients with intentions of us passing out on couches
I'd rather be at my step daddy's house; the mattress where I lay my head
Jamming out to cashing out the classics

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
My ways, my ways, my ways, my ways
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, oh
I'm just trying to change my ways, my ways, my ways
But they just stay the same like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat, oh

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Ooh, I say like a heartbeat
Da-da, mm, da-da da-da, mm
Da-da da-da, mm, da-da, mm
Da-da da-da, mm, oh
Like a heartbeat, like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
