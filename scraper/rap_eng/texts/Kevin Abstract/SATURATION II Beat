[Intro: Dom McLennon]
Glad you found me
Glad you found me
Glad you found me
Glad you found me

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down

[Interlude: Dom McLennon]
Glad you found me
Glad you found me

[Hook: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side

[Bridge: Dom McLennon & Kevin Abstract]
Glad you found me
Glad you found me
Glad you found me
Glad you found me
Only few I'm holding down
Glad you found me
Glad you found me

[Hook: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
