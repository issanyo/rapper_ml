[Verse 1]
Simple girl ended up on your dad's doorstep
(She was a simple girl)
Suddenly, my body fell into yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Bleachers only hold (gotta find it though)
Thunder only grows (gotta find it though)
It's all the same at dark, the sun don't care

[Chorus]
Burn bridges, American Boyfriend
No one knows, no one calls home
American Boyfriend

[Verse 2]
I wanna die on sunset
(He was a pop star with a bounty on his head)
My parents wanna kill me, let them kill me
I'll finally be on TV


[Pre-Chorus]
Bleachers only hold (gotta find it though)
Thunder only grows (gotta find it though)
It's all the same at dark, the sun don't care
(Say it again now, say it again now, yeah)

[Chorus]
Burn bridges, American Boyfriend
No one knows, no one calls home
American Boyfriend

[Bridge]
I found my way

[Outro]
You're my American boy
You are, yeah
