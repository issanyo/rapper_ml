I've been battling
Granny's stuck in [?]
So much traveling
And I've been on my own
Got me battling

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I was raised on pop culture
I never played with guns
Them hazard days would hold me over
My eyes were wide you never lied, I think you brought me closer
Injecting all that Wi-Fi just to dump me in the ocean
Its so forgetting ain't it, now you hate me more than [?]
I only write about it cause I want some fucking closure
So what's the point of pointing fingers if you on the holster
I want a bullet hole inside my skull for you to own it
Now hold that moment
Dont you know that if I pop off right then yeah you'd have to hold my secrets and the truth aight
I only mean it cause I see me on the softer side
There's room in time for you and I but who the fuck decide
Who go in there, who live in there
I swear to God life isn't fair
We give in there
So if you tell me that you care then prove it yeah
I need a year to fucking fail and prove myself to the world
