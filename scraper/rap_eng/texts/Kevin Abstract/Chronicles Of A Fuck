[Intro]
Ah, eh, ah, eh
Ah, ah, ah, hahah

[Verse]
Roll 'round with some potheads
Dodie Mob got bread
Stall the white cops, downin' Sprite, now the lock's next
MJ, crush the motherfuckers like insects
My win's next, drunk as fuck, sittin', sippin' Windex (yah)
Wonders of the world lie inside that little girl
You should see what she's thinkin', what the fuck you sayin'? (yah)
Is you alright right now? Put down my right right now
Step away from that light now
Bitch, for you and this whole town, I'm ill
Illest that you have ever seen
Me and Dom been on the scene (yah)
Throw it off, some medicine
I don't save no fuckin' money
For that Xan with that lean (yah)
Run around the scene with my hands in the sea and my feet on the beach and I mean, goddamn
Goddamn, I'm the man
Tell my momma "I'm the best, I don't need no back-up plan"
I'm realest and the best up in this bih
Ridin' rounder than a Polo with some Dodie Mob since
Fuck makin' sense

[Outro]
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Dodie Mob
