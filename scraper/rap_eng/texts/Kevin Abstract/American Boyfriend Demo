[Verse 1]
Simple girl I ended up on your dad's doorstep
(She was a simple girl)
Suddenly, my body fell into yours
Bleachers only hold, gotta find it though
Thunder only grows, gotta find it though
It's all the same at dark, the sun don't care

[Chorus]
Burn bridges [?]
No one knows, no one calls home
Burn bridges [?]
No one knows, no one calls home

[Verse 2]
I wanna die on sunset (I wanna die, I wanna die)
(He was a pop star with a bounty on his head)
My parents wanna kill me, let them kill me
I'll finally be on TV
Bleachers only hold, gotta find it though
Thunder only grows, gotta find it though
It's all the same at dark, the sun don't care

[Chorus]
Burn bridges [?]
No one knows, no one calls home
Burn bridges [?]
No one knows, no one calls home

[Outro]
I found my way
I found my way
I found my way
