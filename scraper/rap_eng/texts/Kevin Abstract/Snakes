[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Cold morning I wake up on
Someone turned they back on me I can feel it
I know you want something you can turn up to
But this still my favorite song
Cause it's a big fuck you to whoever done hated on
I been drinkin, I been smokin
Normally I'm sober, this so is not me
Ima blame it on my lover
If we was still together
I probably wouldn’t try to kill myself
If you popping off for sure
Keep your demons near your soul
A place where I will never go, at least no more
Cause you protective, keep yourself so bare
And aware, I swear
My lord how did we get here

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hide your feelings baby
You gon need them 8 keys
You gon see them playing
We don’t need vacation
You gon take this visine
Pretend you was never crying
Whenever you beside me I feel like dying

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
And my goals for our home
Seem so right but so wrong
Done postponed from the night
To your eyes in this life
I'll be gone carry on for the sake of my soul
Cause my home will burn, burn, burn, burn
Ya'll bitches really all snakes
Snakes
Ya'll bitches really all snakes
Snakes
Ya'll bitches really all snakes
Snakes
Ya'll bitches really all snakes
Fake

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Reply to me even if you lie to me
In my eyes you look like a god to me
Oh my god you feel like a lottery
In my Macbook wrote a lotta raps about ya
On god, On ma, you mean a lot to me
Corny as ever with a collard shirt
Washed my face in the pure dirt
Before I showed up on your daddy's porch
It was storming and you came out in a skirt
Big bro love to call me a dork
Your old man love to curse my name when he see me
Ain't nobody tell him I'mma be on his TV?
Ain't nobody tell him I'mma be like Jeezy, Yeezy, Weezy?
Wheezing, someone in this room better fucking believe me
Your family want the war, your family want the war
Bringing guns into the church
Tighten my noose in your front lawn
You talking shit that make it worse
You say you love me yea of course
Yea, yea, yea, yea we all know
My pain, my world, my skin, my own

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hide your feelings baby
You gon need them 8 keys
You gon see them playing
We don’t need vacation
You gon take this visine
Pretend you was never crying
Whenever you beside me I feel like dying

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
And my goals for our home
Seem so right but so wrong
Done postponed from the night
To your eyes in this life
I'll be gone carry on for the sake of my soul
Cause my home will burn, burn, burn, burn
Ya'll bitches really all snakes
Snakes
Ya'll bitches really all snakes
Snakes
Ya'll bitches really all snakes
Snakes
Ya'll bitches really all snakes

[Verse 3: Matt Champion & Kevin Abstract]
Fell in love with a model (snakes)
Two drops in that bottle (fake)
Two dollars in wallet
At least you got all that Prada
Oh baby Fuck that
Pill the issue, bet it kill you
Skinny girl, fucked mind, fucked raw, fucking blind
I don't get it why you act like this
You a heartless bitch don't start with me I don't got that shit
We grow apart, We losing touch
I love you bad I hate you good
I hold you close
Wanna get a little taste right
Need your space right
In a little tight place right
Where we lay and waste right
You sex in lace put you on tape
Wanna be last I don't meet your dad
Do dope, drop out, cop out, no top down
But top off, hop on, top no convo pop off
The top of that Tahoe thought all I wanted was a model
I been an asshole, you been a bitch
I been an asshole, you been a bitch
But I hope this last forever baby
Hope this last forever baby
Yea I hope this last forever baby

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion]
Hide them feelings baby
You gon need them eight keys
You gon see them playin
We don't need vacation
You gon take this visine pretend you never crying
Whenever I'm inside you I feel like dying

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
And my goals for our home
Seem so right but so wrong
Done postponed from the night
To your eyes in this life
I'll be gone carry on for the sake of my soul
Cause my home will burn, burn, burn, burn
Ya'll bitches really all snakes
Snakes
Ya'll bitches really all snakes
Snakes
Ya'll bitches really all snakes
Snakes
Ya'll bitches really all snakes

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
And I, I, I
I know when you lie, lie
And I, I, I
I can feel it when you high, high
Ain't no coming down from this high, high
You stuck like this your whole life, life
From the demons to the purple sky, sky
I'm still that normal guy from the South side
The only difference is I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you
The only difference is I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you
The only difference is I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you
The only difference is I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I, I, I
I know when you lie, lie
And I, I, I
I can feel it when you high, high
