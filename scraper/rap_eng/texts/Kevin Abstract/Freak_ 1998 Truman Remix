[Chorus]
Freak (yeah, yeah)
Oh, your love
Won't you come this close to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me, now that you're free (freak, free)
Oh yeah (yeah)
Won't you come this close to me, baby? (baby, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Taking time, taking mine (ooh-woah)
Let your hair lay on his side
Bless your mind, baby it's over and done, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I know the way to make-
You know I hate to lie
Ooh
But you are, you are, you are, baby
But you gotta be a freak

[Chorus]
Freak (yeah, yeah)
Oh, your love
Won't you come this close to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me, now that you're free (freak, free)
Oh yeah (yeah)
Won't you come this close to me, baby? (Baby, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Over eighteen with the windows flyin'
Her brown skin with her fingers lie
In the air like it's early, high, oh, oh
But I don't want you to go girl 'cause I'm tired of the waiting
Tired of the waiting
Tired of waiting
But you gotta be a freak

[Chorus]
Freak (yeah, yeah)
Oh, your love
Won't you come this close to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me, now that you're free (freak, free)
Oh yeah
Won't you come this close to me, baby? (Baby, yeah)
