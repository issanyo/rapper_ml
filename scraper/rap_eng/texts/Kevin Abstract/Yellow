[Verse 1]
Passed the pilot, took my bottle
All my sorrows, home tomorrow
All my luggage, expired passport
I think you hate me, the hell do I know
Above ground level, I feel a crash coming
Jesus in my hand, I don't believe in nothing (Jesus, Jesus Christ)
I wanna build a sandcastle for no reason
I never wanted to end up with you
And my, my, my, my, my

[Chorus]
If the trees were yellow
That would cure my heartbreak
Memories fade, I let go
Just to give the clouds a break
If you really love me
You gotta sacrifice it baby
If you really want me
You gotta sacrifice it baby
If the trees were yellow
That would cure my heartbreak
Memories fade, I let go
Just to give the clouds a break
If you really love me
You gotta sacrifice it baby
If you really want me
You gotta sacrifice it baby

[Verse 2]
Special inconsistent moments hone in
This screen will never ever let us hold hands
I always wanted someone that could be free
Sand between my feet and the distance between

[Chorus]
If the trees were yellow
That would cure my heartbreak
Memories fade, I let go
Just to give the clouds a break
If you really love me
You gotta sacrifice it baby
If you really want me
You gotta sacrifice it baby

[Outro]
Don't leave me on the edge
I wanna be yellow
Don't leave me on the edge
I wanna be yellow
I wanna be yellow
It's bright like yellow
It's so so yellow
It's bright like yellow
This song's so yellow
It's bright like yellow
