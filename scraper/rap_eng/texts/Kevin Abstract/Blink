[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
I feel, I feel like a new man
All I need is a mothafuckin' (Bleep)
And a mothafuckin' (Bleep)
And some new glasses
Wait, I got those, I got those!

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Feet glued to the floor, baby, I need more of you
Your pores tells me more than a mothafuckin' whore do
I need rounds, I need [censored]
I need drugs, I need [censored]
I need companionship, I need an internship
I need a friend, I need you to hate me
I need you to tell me I'm better than Drake
I need attention, I need a flannel that's not bloody
I wish my mommy would try loving
I'm tired of everybody saying they don't want nothing
'Cause I wake up with my shoes missing
I'm tired of my dad saying he's gon' come home
And I wake up alone in the kitchen
No breakfast for me, my sister is gone
And she took the car
Have to take the bus, I'ma have to take the bus
I don't wanna take the bus
They hate me on the bus, they push me on the bus
That why I never wake up
That's why I snooze when my fucking phone go off
That's why I snooze

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Say you ain't special, my baby
Say you ain't special, my baby
My hands, my hands in yours
I'll try to come back home

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I'll tell you what
We coulda had a good life together, a fucking real good life
Had us a place of our own
But you didn't want it did ya? You didn't want it
Everything's built on that, that's all we got boy, fucking all
So I hope you know that if you don't never know the rest
You have no idea how bad it gets
