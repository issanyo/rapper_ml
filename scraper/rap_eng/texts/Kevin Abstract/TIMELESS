[Verse]
Young expo, alphabet ghetto
I forget whatever y'all niggas think is special
X, Y, Z me, I be on three
Pullin' up at my momma crib with some codeine
I hang with vine niggas, R.I.P to Vine, nigga
At the end of this shit, it's just me and my niggas
So I don’t give a fuck if you niggas can't get it
I turn around and I spit it how I hear it in my head
I’m a motherfucking visionary, Rick Rubin confirmed it
Hip-hop birthed it and white boys cursed him
Bitch I ain't from no motherfucking rap collective
I rap to get paid and it’s a way of expression
I wish my skin was darker, nigga
I wish all them white kids that claimed they was my friends
Really knew what they was doing when they said I wasn’t just like "them"
"Them" meaning other blacks, making me feel not black
What the fuck is wrong with all of y'all? Pass me some crack
I'ma end this shit right now and ruin my career before I even really have one
Nigga still the bad son, hanging with the bad sons
Fucking all these racist white men's pretty bad sons
I don’t know fashion, my jawline ain't right
I don’t make trap music, my Instagram likes light
I need a new rap mic, I need a new rap name
Cause double XL
I ain't ever gon' fuck with a nigga that don’t sell
Ever gon' fuck with a nigga that do tell
All the fucking truth ain't do it from the fuckin' cell
On the real, I keep it real but niggas just don’t wanna hear
