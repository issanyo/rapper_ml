[Verse 1: Ravenna Golden]
Could someone please, someone tell me
What's going, what's going, tell me!
I try to live up to the hype, but the words never come out quite right anymore
I can't seem to stop checking my phone
I wanna see you, I wanna see you
So send me your face
Wanna keep up with you, can I keep up with you?
Think that I'm able to, I wanna be able to

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
Why you always coming around here
Trailing some new kill
Now let's try and get each other's off/on mind
Let's just be right now, lets put it all behind
Now girl, you know you're all i ever wanted
I need you in my life and there's nothing that I could do about it
And there's nothing I could do about it
Among the time we talk about it

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
(?) about it
Something with me, it's nothing to me
I need you right here
Send me your things and leave me a piece
Leave me a piece, all I have
