[Intro]
Oooh, Oooh
Oooh, Oooh

[Verse 1]
It feels just like a lie
Our love's just like it's true
It all fades to blue, ooh
I don't wanna be
The type of guy you trust
Never fool
[?] me

[Pre-Chorus]
Dig me more fire
No, no, no, nothing more
Get me more higher
No, no, I'm still slow
No, no, no, no, yeah (x2)

No, no, no, no, yeah

[Chorus]
Tune me out
Tune me out, baby
Drown me out
Drown me out, baby
You drown me out
You drown me out (x2)

[Verse 2]
Walked all over me
I know that I'm a slave
Of wanting you
But I know
Thanks to tife
I spoke too quick
I loved too free

[Pre-Chorus]
Dig me more fire
No, no, no, nothing more
Get me more higher
No, no, I'm still slow
No, no, no, no, yeah (x2)

No, no, no, no, yeah

Oooh, Oooh

[Chorus]
Tune me out
Tune me out, baby
Drown me out
Drown me out, baby
You drown me out
You drown me out (x2)

[Outro]
Oooh, Oooh
