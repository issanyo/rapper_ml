[Verse 1]
Bye summer
A lot of drugs was used in my summer
Lotta love was made in that Honda
Accord
5 dedo discount in a store
5 niggas claim they love you more
They wasn’t shooting in the gym that’s for sure
With us
Do I give you up
Do I give this up
We can die together
Poison live with us
We can ride together until the jig is up
You been lyin forever when you gon grow up
Same needles you know shit is not healthy
Inject then breathe in my seat I’m melting
Your eyes are glued to a brick wall
Your soul is glued to some death tar
So is mine I doubt we’ll ever ever see tomorrow

[Bridge]
Can you hold my hand
That's all I want, all I want
In the dark I stand
I am lost
Could you hold my hand
That's all I want, all I need
In the dark I stand
I am lost

[Outro]
Could you hold my hand
That's all I want, all I want
In the dark I stand
I am lost
I'm not scared to admit it
I'm not here for a visit
I'm dying slowly
You hold me
Could you hold my hand
That's all I want, all I want
In the dark I stand
I am lost
I'm not scared to admit it
I'm not here for a visit
I'm dying
