[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
I ain't gon' let em' say nothin'
I ain't gon let you take nothin'
You ain't gon' tell me how to do it
[?] still fluent
[?] run around
Lovin' you lovin' still dress better [?] clothes gets so
Fresh as a [?]
Fresher than you
[?] out the [?]
Took down the [?]
[?] got on my nerves
Know i love you but you reaped on my world
Rampage
Godzilla, godzilla
Baby you crash on the city
Distressing your leggings
You let me in but you still knockin' so heavy
Knockin' so heavy (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion]
I know you hate when you think about me
I know you hate when you think about me

[Chorus: bearface]
Then tell me what you need
To fall apart (To fall apart)
And I know that something's wrong
Then tell me what you need
To fall apart (To fall apart)
And I know that something's wrong
