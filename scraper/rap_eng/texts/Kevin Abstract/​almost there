[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I think I just fell in love with an African that come from nothing nice
Hands dirty, live a double life
[?] every night
Think the motive's off
He off a dirty sprite
When the government fall, the only truth in the sky
And the sky is the world
And a mirror on the [?]
'Til I'm dead with a mother fucking bullet in my head
What's love nigga?
My friends [?] off a blood nigga
Why the fuck I'm still dealing with these fuck niggas?
Every single chance I get, it's the friends I left
Don't be the friends I left
Cause they turn to deaf
Only here for a check
Oh you're here for a check? Oh I'm here for a check
I use my imagination to build a mother fucking friend with some god damn respect
I been rapping a sec
Been saying, nigga
Been saying everyday, nigga
Truth been saying nigga, so what they say nigga?
Do they mean they need to pray nigga?
I'd rather take a gun, point it at the sun, let it run, let it run
To the pain it should
Miss me, miss me now
Miss me
