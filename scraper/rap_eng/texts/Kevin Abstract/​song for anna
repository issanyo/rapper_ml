[Verse]
I don't think I've ever met anyone
That makes my heart smile just as much as you do
Rather be in a casket
A dead bastard
Who knew someone just as perfect as you
I think my dreams are coming true
I think my dreams are coming true

And the only reason how I know the sky is blue
From the view in your [?]
Because my hands are all over you ([?] to me)
