[Verse 1 - Sage]
Wish I could live as Peter Pan
Always be a kid, never have to be a man
My ideal lifestyle is right now:
Making beats, and lacing in this right style
I mean, I want a wife and kids, no Mike Kyle
But I'm tryna live my dreams, it's happening right now
Just tell me how we're supposed to run the rap game
Rocking wack chains
And writing lame raps over
Even lamer tracks, mane
We're just a bunch of fucking teenage losers
Rejecting status quo of others we named stupid
The man who joins on our side, well he ain't foolish, nah
Foolish is the man who said we can't do this
We got 10 fucking cities behind us
And once we set our goals you know we made our minds up
XVII dropped, man y'all niggas' time's up
We officially got the rap game lined up

I ain't never gonna wake up
Forever I'mma stay down low
A lot of them hate us
But hate's something you can't control
Do your thing
Do it fast
Do it now
Before you crash
Do your thing
Do it fast
Do it now
Peter Pan

[Verse 2 - Kevin Abstract]
You and I should fly
To the horizon
Hide out, they will
Try and find us
But we lay low though
Keep it down low, yo
No Facebook, no Twitter and
Damn sure no Insta-photo
Get away for a day from every little thing
They say we're growing up
But we don't wanna go
I love you, you love me
Keep each other company
And when they'll come, you'll run with me
To destiny, a better place
We'll rest in peace, not heaven's way
Don't listen to what reverends say
Follow your heart
To a better way
Get on a better path, that's
All that they say to you
Try to prove they pray for you
Want them to understand
They can't design the way for you
This is our life
Live how we want
In due time
You'll be fine
Damn
Can't believe I'm
Finna be a man
Float on, Peter Pan, uh

[Hook - Kevin Abstract]
I ain't never gonna wake up
Forever I'mma stay down low
A lot of them hate us
But hate's something you can't control
Do your thing
Do it fast
Do it now
Before you crash
Do your thing
Do it fast
Do it now
Peter Pan

[Verse 3 - Sage]
I'm in a new age, a new wave
Of niggas wearing toupees
I'm too faded
Chilling with Raymond
I feel like 2chainz
I'm through saving
Hoes, now I feel I
Got a new brain
And that's on the racks
A nigga tryna get his dues paid
Talk shit bout the dream squad you may
At the end of this new day
We're the creme brulee
I'm sick and tired of
Spitting this through the wire
And having y'all look me over
Truth be told my one desire
Is to get my hand shook
By a list of my idols
And have all these bitches dancing
Until they feet is tired
See my packs stay loud
But I'm quiet moving silent
It's a price to live my dreams?
Let me go head and buy it, cause
By and by I can finally
Quit with all of the crying
And begin with this smiling
This is hope that I'm providing
I tried to told 'em it's forever
We Alive since (ASF!)
I tried to told 'em it's forever
We Alive since

[Hook - Kevin Abstract]
I ain't never gonna wake up
Forever I'mma stay down low
A lot of them hate us
But hate's something you can't control
Do your thing
Do it fast
Do it now
Before you crash
Do your thing
Do it fast
Do it now
