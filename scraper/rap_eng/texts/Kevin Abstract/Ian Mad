[Intro]
Kevin lab rats, nigga, Abstract, nigga, ask that
Nigga, bring it right back, nigga, missed the all caps, nigga
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nig, yeah

[Verse]
Fell from the sky at the age of three
Always wondered why the kids in class looked so different than me
Didn't bother me much, took my crayons to lunch
I ain't give a fuck, made my own squad, weird bunch
Dodi Mob in this bitch, get used to it
"Fuck your dreams, your a teen, stay being a student"
That's what Mrs. Saenz said
Well, it don't really matter 'cause Ms. Saenz dead in my mothafucking head
I'm a dreamer, I'm a leader, I'ma mothafucking star
Pyramids fell from the sky and landed on my front lawn
Now my mom thinks I'm crazy and a little bit gone
Out of my mind, but we'll be fine I'ma give her six months
To think about the situation and just understand me
But you know how parents be, when it comes down to parenting
Excuse me for the ranting, but I hope you understand me
Hello, I hope you feel me
America can you hear me?
And I just recently moved to Atlanta
I'm an outcast here and I ain't close to Savannah
I don't roll with no tools, I ain't holdin' no hamma
I don't roll with them fools who be wearing bandannas
No hype beast, nah nah nigga
Rather raw-dog a dog and jam out to Rahdigga
At the same damn time, yeah, bitch, that's right
No metaphor within these lines, no dollar signs in these eyes
It's the passion with this shit, that's gon' make the squad rise
I ain't gotta rap on old ass beats, or talk about my third eye
(Oooh why? Why he say that shit?)
'Cause I'm tired of all these bloggers postin' lame ass shit
That same ass shit, one train ass shit
I've been telling you exactly what that bullshit is, ass shit
You can ask ya squad or ask ya god
We go so got damn hard, word to big brother Dom
And I ain't goin' out without no fight
We deserve the praises that you serve to the most high, most lie
So I'ma be on stage screaming, be on stage singing
Represent every teenager in they bedroom dreamin'
Bring something to the big screen and finally have a meaning
Shut shit down, go so hard
Rest in peace to Steve Jobs, said I go so hard
Nigga squad, Dodi Mob

[Break]
Thirty five in this bitch
Lab rats, all nine 'til forever, nigga
Yeah, that shit right out
Keep goin', business
Keep go

[Outro]
I rep, I rep alive 'til forever
I rep, I rep, I rep a nine 'til forever
I rep, I rep, I said ALIVESINCEFOREVER
I rep, I rep, I set a nine 'til forever
