[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
I say "fuck it," like James Dean
Keep my money on Great Dane
And these kids is scared of me like my face was porcelain
And my bitch is melting
Sipping pouches of orange Tang
Always hopping white lines like parking spots is cocaine

P-party tomorrow, I hope I don't get too wet
Because there's pussy everywhere so I am sure I'll be drenched
And give that ass just a pinch, and keep your lips on that straw
And suck like your brain needs a margarita, (fuck you!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Doing drugs by the pool, hope you don't fall in
Ass up by the pool, hope you don't fall in
Cool bitch by the pool, hope she don't fall in... love

[Chorus: Matt Champion & Kevin Abstract]
I'm sick, (salud)
Need a drink, (salud)
Here's a toast for you fucks, (salud)
Bless you, (salud)
Need a smoke, (salud)
Here's a toast for you fucks, (salud, salud)

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Hold on bitch, I need a minute to puke
This liquor has me feeling like giraffes at a zoo
Wobbling, tipping, turning, and slurring my words
Like i'm riding alibaba at my local Six Flags
They put grams of the powder in six separate bags
Then they hide it somewhere deep deep deep in their pants
I feel like a dick because I'm thinking like one
Maybe it's me, but then again it's the rum, fuck

[Pre-Chorus]
Doing drugs by the pool, hope you don't fall in
Ass up by the pool, hope you don't fall in
Cool bitch by the pool, hope she don't fall in love

[Chorus]
I'm sick, (salud)
Need a drink, (salud)
Here's a toast for you fucks, (salud)
Bless you, (salud)
Need a smoke, (salud)
Here's a toast for you fucks, (salud, salud)

[Verse 3: Michael Christmas]
Salud to the bitch
Pouring champagne on a cute lil bitch
Tossing TVs out the window, move your whip
Go move your shit, aye, aye, tick tick
Get drunk, turn British
Girl, lemme see 10 digits
I came in with 10 niggas
Got in a fight with at least 10 midgets
Sold out shows, I was high like pigeons
Matt got internet-hoes doing splits
I might sell Viagra to high school kids, there's really no telling the way that we live
When the smoke don't clear cause it's always smoke
Toast to the times you could only make toast
Dave Chappelle, fuck your bitch while you ghost
Kanye West, finna get this vote
I'm pro-whatever-the-fuck-you-wanna-do, do it
You getting all the juice, prove it
Show me a cup that's full, foolish
Finna 'a-choo' it, I'm sick

[Chorus]
I'm sick, (salud)
Need a drink, (salud)
Here's a toast for you fucks, (salud)
Bless you, (salud)
Need a smoke, (salud)
Here's a toast for you fucks, (salud, salud)
