[Verse 1]
I ain't got nobody, nobody else proud of me
Standin on my own two, my parents still ain't proud of me
Rich as hell I wanna be, money gon' be the death of me
Celebrate my flaws and all them lil niggas laugh at me
Did it on my own so I got no momma house
All the lame ass niggas still they stood at they momma's house
Damn nigga you like that shit, that them white boys like
And it got more weird when they saw the white boys in my life
