[Chorus 1: Kevin Abstract]
I take a sign from the past ([?])
I take a sign from the last ([?])
Oh you're living so damn comfortable
I know you're living so damn comfortable
I take a sign from the past ([?])
I take a sign from the last ([?])
Oh you're living so damn comfortable
I know you're living so damn comfortable

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Don't nobody call police
Don't nobody call police
Every time I speak
Damn, every time I speak
Someone check ID
All eyes on me
Damn, all eyes one me
I was tryna make it to [?]
Why your hands on me?
Get your hands off me
They don't wanna let a nigga breathe
Every time I try to breathe
And I know I'm fucked up
Look at my eyes, I'mma tell you how I fucked up
Damn
And I know I'm fucked up
Look at my eyes, I'mma tell you how I fucked up
Damn

[Chorus 2: Kevin Abstract (+ Allan Kingdom)]
I take a sign from the past ([?])

Oh you're living so damn comfortable
I know you're living so damn comfortable
I take a sign from the past ([?])
I take a sign from the last ([?])
Oh you're living so damn comfortable
I know you're living so damn comfortable

[Verse 2: Allan Kingdom]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm geeked, just got me new sneaks
Sneeking through and fuckin' on ya
Beasting through assumptions on ya
I'm deep, I like your [?]
Them hoes don't got nothing on ya
That is why I'm nuttin' on ya
I'm fresh, swear I feel [?]
Arm got a [?] on it
You could feel the [?] don't
I'm chill, eat your ass at will
Salty 'bout your rice, you try us
Cook you like some jambalaya
No burner
If you wanna talk my ass might turn up
If you wanna last, just watch, I'll learn ya
Nigga with class, get [?], I earned her
No perma, make tracks [?]
Spread love, get love
All my niggas so comfy, it's so chill

[Chorus 3: Kevin Abstract (+ Allan Kingdom)]
I take a sign from the past ([?])

I know you're living so damn comfortable
I take a sign from the past ([?])
I take a sign from the last ([?])
Oh you're living so damn comfortable

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Close my eyes
Don't let me fall
I hope to die
Before you call
