[Hook]
My fingers in creases
Of distant dark places
Your words mostly noises
Ghosts with just voices
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me

[Verse 1: Yung $hy]
Don't act like you never knew me
When I see you now you look right through me
It's humiliating how you used me
I know it's Tuesday but you're way to choosey
Talk about the fam but you know I ain't got one
All these fans around me but this shit still is not fun
I don't care, I'm just chilling with the Tear Gang
And boys do cry so it's lies that The Cure sang
The pain of the weight that you put upon me is too much
You looked in my eyes, my face you would touch
To your lips I was addicted
But now the pain is inflicted
Your words in my memory
As I tried to pull back time
Are like music to me
But now nothing is fine, because you left me behind

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I don't even think I wanna know you better
Seems like it's been so long we been round forever
Everything I write I'm hoping that it's clever
And I know you need me now more than ever
Just hold on to my soul
Don't let go, just hold me close
Hold on to my soul
Don't let me, don't let me go

[Hook]
