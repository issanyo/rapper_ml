[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
I threw up all that liquor
I was 'sposed to hold it (hold it!)
When I go out to party I get paranoia (lonely!)
I'ma island out in Bali, you supposed to hold me (hold me!)
Duckin' when I'm at the store, 'cause he might put me on bruh
Damn I missed the days when I didn't have a lawyer
Damn I missed the days when I didn't have cable
Damn I missed the days when I didn't have paper
When the nigga I was buggin' wasn't hitting me for favor

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Fifty off the top, the double ceilings on your backside
Switchin' out positions in your car like all the quick guys
Sneaking undercover, hopping fences in your backyard
I was on the floor, sun bathing just like a wet towel
I wish I could scoop you out the pool
Remember the first time I pulled a move?
Well damn, I guess I'm off it
'Cause the check for me not office
My brother been bossin' up like steroids was in his coffee
We all be going through it
We're crazy ex-lovers
Theyâ€™re making me block my number
But damn you know I gotcha
Alright

[Interlude]
What was wrong with the world?
(everybody's talking about the good 'ol days)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hey y'all, hey y'all
I really wanna see ya, I want love
I got it on my way now to your house
To show you how it's safe now
But you got love for me though
Hey y'all, hey y'all
I really wanna see ya, I want love
I got it on my way now to your house
To show you how it's safe now
But you got love for me though
