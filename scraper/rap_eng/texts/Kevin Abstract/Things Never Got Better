[Verse 1: NOK from the Future]
Leaves are turning to the end
Of a picture perfect scene
To a lifestyle paved with greed, oh no
Autumn, oh autumn
You let me down, when you came around, oh no
Cause I don’t wanna live my last days out in sorrow
I don’t wanna live my last days out in sorrow
I don’t wanna wake up to the cold of tomorrow, no
Mama, sweet mama
Hear me out, I’m moving out

[Verse 2: NOK from the Future]
I can’t wait to leave this town behind and move away
Far away and I won’t forget this day is where that-
One day's night, I promised you would witness
How I could change the world
Yes, I’ve fallen, I’ve fallen
I can’t get up
Do you will get up
Yes, I’ve fallen, I’ve fallen
I can’t get up
Do you will get up
I will get up

[Verse 3: NOK from the Future]
When you found me in the dark
Left me stranded for the ark
You always said you’d be there for me
Well friendships always wither
Like tulips in the winter
But the summers almost over and I still ain’t got no closure from you
You would never change but you wanted me to
Bitch I wish I could be back to sober you
And another one, and another one, and another one’s gone
We don’t get along, no we don’t really ever get along

[Verse 4: Kevin Abstract]
Let's just ride around
Cassie on repeat, it's just you and me
Let's just ride around
Egotistical fell in love at seventeen
How did I
How did I fall back then
Now that I, now that I found myself
If you fell in love with the wrong person,just remind yo'self
That you gotta fall in love with the wrong person
Just to find yourself
