[Verse 1]
Wish I could quit you
Got your name across my chest
Still sleeping with the window open
Why can't I get you out of my head, my head
You say these things just happen, why must we let them happen?
I quit my job the other day, even though I'm in need of the money
They say I threw my life away, no shit, I threw my life away
I quit my job the other day, even though I'm in need of the money
They say I threw my life away, no shit, I threw my life away

[Bridge]
Away

[Verse 2]
Dad tried to tell me that I'm not functional
I got a bunch of homies, but not a bunch of homes
Said come back home to an empty home
I got a different home, my home is...
My dad tried to tell me that I'm not functional
I got a bunch of homies, but not a bunch of homes
Said come back home to an empty home
I gotta different home, my home is fake

[Bridge]
Ooh, ahh, ooh
Away

[Verse 3]
Told a lie and I'm sorry
Let me make it up at the football game
Pick you up in the morning
Let me make it up at the football game
Who was I when I was lonely
Let me make it up at the football game
I told a lie and I'm sorry, ooh
Told a lie and I'm sorry
Let me make it up at the football game
Pick you up in the morning
Let me make it up at the football game
Who was I when I was lonely?
Let me make it up at the football game
Let's make out at the bleachers

[Outro]
Say it's ok when it's not
Say it's ok when it's not
Say it's ok when it's not
Say it's ok when it's not, not, duh
Say it's ok when it's not
Say it's ok when it's not, not, duh
You're all I got
Say it's ok when it's not
