[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
I use to dream of the sea
And everything that you can be
I use to stay up late
Wondering is this fate?
I still think we're one
But do you think that, huh?
Things change, people leave
It's all good, at least I got the sea
See? I got the sea

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Now I can start this rap off with some slick shit
Or go opposite and be mad ignant
Big chains made some change, real Slick Rick
But anyways, I gotta say, you made me sick, chick
How you gon diss this sick kid and leave me in a deep ditch
For dead heartbroken suicidal put a bullet in my head
I mean, might as well right? Feels like hell right?
One bad night can make ya hate ya whole life
And I learned that back in '03
When my sister lost a friend he took pills an OD'd
And I ain't know how she feel til I lost a homie
You came in screaming & crying and begging mommy
If we could bring him back with some prayers
And when he ain't return it made me wonder
If there's a man up there upstairs
That we praying to, praying out loud
With life, if they want you gone, then you out

I used to dream of the sea
And everything that you can be
I use to stay up late
Wondering, is this fate?
I still think we're one
But do you think that, huh?
Things change, people leave
It's all good, at least I got the sea
See? I got the sea

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
Similar incidents, penitent menaces
Losing grip of the whip and I'm thinkin' I put a dent in it
Drinks, finish it, maybe not, swallow oxycots
My troubles fade and my head nods off
Now that papa's gone, things been going wrong
And me and moms is crawling so I guess he's walking strong
Here we go again, lift off, light a bong
Cheech and Chong, I guess I'm wrong
Caught in prescriptions verse descriptions getting similar
Niggas slowly gettin' sick of it
Mention it, me and Mr. Simpson and a group of misfits
Getting into shit, limitless infinite sentiments
Whether genius or a piece of shit
We'll see what we can make of it
Steady chasing dreams and I will never walk away from it
Never see me faking it
Always on my path, never see me stray from it
43 perfectionist, see the songs we making bitch?
