[Intro]
Staring at the sky ain't gon' fix my problem
Staring at the sky ain't gon' fix my problem
Howling at the moon ain't gon' bring you back
Howling at the moon ain't gon' bring you back
Staring at the sky ain't gon' fix my problem
Staring at the sky ain't gon' fix my problem
Howling at the moon ain't gon' bring you back
Howling at the moon ain't gon' bring you back

[Verse]
I started smoking cigarettes, I even picked up pot again
Coke ain't touch my nose yet, I'm afraid I'll be just like my friend
I'm afraid I ain't gon' have no friends
Oh my god, when do my story end?
Tell me God, when do my story end?
I'm locked outside of the DeLorean

[Hook]
He was a bad son, he was a bad son
He was a bad son, he was a bad son
So he left home, so he left home
He had to run, yeah, he had to run, yeah
He had to run, yeah, he had to run, yeah
Nowhere to go, nowhere to go

[Bridge]
You can take a look into my eyes
You can take a look into my eyes
Go ahead and tell me what you find
You can take a look into my eyes
You can take a look into my eyes
You can take a look into my eyes
Tell me what you like
Go ahead and tell me what you find

[Outro]
When it all fall down, where you going now
When it all fall down, where you going now
When it all fall down, where you run to now
When it all come down, where you run to now
Where you run to now, where you run to now
Where you run to now, where you run to now
