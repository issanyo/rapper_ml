[Skit]
This for all my dogs
This for all my dogs
I'm tryna find my motherfucking way

You was right there
Right on my side
I shouldve listened to you

You was right there
Right on my side
Ain't pay attention to you

You was right there
Right on my side
I shouldve listened to you

You was right there
Right in my side
Ain't pay attention to you

I dedicate this song to all my motherfucking niggas
This for all my dogs
(You know I love ya)
No bitch niggas
This for all my real niggas
(But I love ya)
All my niggas that stood right by me
After all the bullshit i done been through
This for you
(I love ya)
Thanks for sticking with a nigga with issues
I appreciate you
