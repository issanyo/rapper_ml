[Intro]
These tears are made for both
These tears are made for both
For both of us
Both
For both of us
These tears are made for both
Wet my face, Wet my face

[Verse 1]
In gucci slippers
Shining like the diamonds on my shirt
I love leaving this bubble
As the trees turn to people
And concrete buildings
My maid is just as broken as me
She fucks up everything that I clean
My dad owns a business
Well I got a business of my own
All these homes are dressed as clones
Ain't a scale for my soul
I only sell because I'm bored
I hope my mom sees me on TV
With handcuffs around the court stand
When they ask me to stand up and tell the truth
But I cry 'cause I don't know who I am

[Chorus]
Cry
Cause I dont know who I am
I dont know
I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry
I cry
Cause I dont know who I am
I dont know
I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry
I cry

[Verse 2]
I wish sky was here
I bet she'd know what to do
Like when she stopped me from killing myself
Barely hanging from the roof
Or when we were making out
In her dad's car
She'd tell me to lighten up
I grab a blunt
She lights it up
I depend on humans
I depend on friendships
And I depend on fitting in
I don't need the feelings numb
As much as I used to
How the fuck imma tell my best friend
He makes my heart move as much as she used to

[Interlude]
I'm a disappointment
My heart is barely working
Life is barely worth it
Searching for any purpose (2x)

Crying in the bathtub
Crying in the bathtub
Crying

Broken In the bathtub
Broken in the bathtub
Crying
Scared in the bathtub

[Chorus]
Cry
Cause I don't know who I am
I dont know
I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry
I cry
Cause I dont know who i am
I dont know
I cry I cry I cry I cry
I cry
