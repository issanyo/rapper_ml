[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Cross my heart, let me be
Tripped in the dark, you found me
And boy I'll be back when you're lonely if you want me to
My parents don't know what's gotten into me since I've met you

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
And hold, hold
Hold, hold

[Chorus: Roy Blair]
When you wanna let go, when you wanna let go
When you wanna move on, move on, ooh
Why you gotta let go? Why you gotta let go?
Why you gotta move on? Move on, ooh

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
When you let

[Chorus: Roy Blair]
When you wanna let go, when you wanna let go
When you wanna move on, move on, ooh
