[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Cross my heart, let me be
Tripped in the dark, you found me
And boy I'll be back when you're lonely if you want me to
My parents don't know what's gotten into me since I've met you

[Chorus: Roy Blair & Kevin Abstract]
When you wanna let go, when you wanna let go
When you wanna move on, move on, move
Why you gotta let go, why you gotta let go
Why you gotta move on, move on, move
When you wanna let go, when you wanna let go
(When you let)
When you wanna move on, move on, move
Why you gotta let go, why you gotta let go
Why you gotta move on, move on, move
