[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
(Why?)

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Phone ringing, never outgoing, homebody
Never outgoing, put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish adding notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wideout, wideout
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off-kilter, off-kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gonna make it better, maybe better for ya
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a deadhead zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't giving up, you should set it off
Tell me “Time's up”, let the water run, let my body run

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
(Why?)

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Said she wanna get high off a nigga
I wanna die during sex or religion
God and pussy only know my intentions
Waking on the tour bus then I'm swimming
You'd be hurtin' if you trust me but you isn't
Honestly, that's probably the right decision
Prick up, listen, if you wanna get rich
No sleep, how real bad man wake up

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I found false hope in all kinda places
Hotel rooms and temporary feelings
I put my clothes on and try to check out
I try to hide from the sun, let it set now
Don't let God see me, I got a lot of demons
And I've been sleeping with 'em
And now I'm tangled in the sheets and sinking deeper with 'em
I'm going deeper in it, find me drownin' in it

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
They said “Do you make mistakes or do you make a change
Or do you draw the line for when it's better days?”
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me “Do you make mistakes or do you make a change
Or do you draw the line for when it's better days?”
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why
(Why?)

[Bridge: Joba]
Everything I have is a mirror
And everywhere I stand isn't solid ground
People don't make sense to me anymore
I'm hiding out, again
Tryna figure it out
I'm tryna figure it out
I'm tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky

[Outro: bearface]
Everything you wear, I'll be the one to care
Softly raise your hair, all the angels stare, yeah
Tell me why, tell me why
(Why?)
