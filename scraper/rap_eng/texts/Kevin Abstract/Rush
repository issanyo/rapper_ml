[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
When I see ya
Our life could end
And when I'm near ya
You don't need your friends
I fell in love with an angel
And don't nobody know
I think I might tell her
I fell in love with an angel
And she don't even know
I think I might tell her

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
My baby don't tell me she love me when she in a rush
I'm with it, I'm in it until I'm falling out of love
The girl on this Earth see me all on my bad days
I'm down in the dirt give me my faith for a Sunday
My baby don't tell me she love me when she in a rush
I'm with it, I'm in it until I'm falling out of love
The girl on this Earth see me all on my bad days
I'm down in the dirt give me my faith for a Sunday

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
And when I see ya
Our life could end
And when I'm in ya
I feel my world cave in
I fell in love with an angel
And she don't even know
I think I might tell her
I fell in love with a white girl
And she don't even know
I think I might tell her

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
My baby don't tell me she love me when she in a rush
I'm with it, I'm in it until I'm falling out of love
The girl on this Earth see me all on my bad days
I'm down in the dirt give me my faith for a Sunday
My baby don't tell me she love me when she in a rush
I'm with it, I'm in it until I'm falling out of love
The girl on this Earth see me all on my bad days
I'm down in the dirt give me my faith for a Sunday

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
I see a light that shines so bright tonight
And I know that when I close my eyes you'll be gone again

[Verse 3: Sage Williams]
Bae why you be playing?
You think I'm running game, not even hearing what I'm saying
And that's damn near everything except what I need to
Talking to my boys and they suggest that I leave you
But, who the hell else am I gon' text girl I need you
I love it when you dress up really sexy and see through
And yeah your body steady banging just like the beat do
How the hell I get so lucky when I said nice to meet you

[Chorus - Kevin Abstract]
My baby don't tell me she love me when she in a rush
I'm with it, I'm in it until I'm falling out of love
The girl on this Earth see me all on my bad days
I'm down in the dirt give you my faith for a Sunday
My baby don't tell me she love me when she in a rush
I'm with it, I'm in it until I'm falling out of love
The girl on this Earth see me all on my bad days
I'm down in the dirt give me my faith for a Sunday

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I-you know what
I might give you a call
Cause I have never played a girl
