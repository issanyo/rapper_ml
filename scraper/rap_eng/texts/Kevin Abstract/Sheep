[Bridge 1: Kevin Abstract]
The sun won't be here long (x4)

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Born in 96
Been spitting this since
Shit, the 5th grade
Little nigga go away
Little one go somewhere and play yo games
Hide your shame
Dig your grave
You mental slave
Talk for days
Can't hide your ways
Catch the fade
With that fucked up fade
Anyways I have to say
I put my life on the track
Still the keep squad on my back
How cliche was that?
Didn't like it?
Then turn my song off and never look back

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
In this moment, I like it
I feel lonely, but don't mind
Don't worry man I'mma do me
Don't worry man I'mma do me
In this moment, I like it
I feel lonely, but don't mind
Don't worry man I'mma do me
I see the light and it's shining for me

[Bridge 2: Kevin Abstract]
The sun won't be here long (x4)

[Verse 2: MiC Kurb]
Born in 95 hit you with the blind side
Wise guy, never been a sitter on the side lines
So I'm back to the spot where I write rhymes
Then they wanna tell me that the music is a side style
I ain't never been a thug but I act wild
I ain't never been in love, never that no
I ain't never been a nigga but a black child
So I gotta talk about if I smash hoes
Yo, Flow, so, cold
MiC Kurb been a spitta since the fab 5
And I never really plan on getting that old
What a beauty to be growing up a black guy
If a black eye, sees and believes
Only she who can achieve
What she dreams
Will indeed
Be the queen of a motherland of fiends
& the genes
Of the world and nobody really feels what she means
Like that

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
In this moment, I like it
I feel lonely, but don't mind
Don't worry man I'mma do me
Don't worry man I'mma do me
In this moment, I like it
I feel lonely, but don't mind
Don't worry man I'mma do me
I see the light and it's shining for me

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't you cry
