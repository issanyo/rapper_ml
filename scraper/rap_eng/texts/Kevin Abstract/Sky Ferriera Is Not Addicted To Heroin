I look at clocks while I'm dreaming and feel illiterate, tripped into a lucid state; now I'm hitting barbiturates. Crip walking on cloud 9, aware and ignorant. Misfit of the genesis with emphasis, Demolishing pretentiousness

                                    Copped a holy grail from the app store

                                                  Sipping enthenogens out of the cup of Jesus then

                                             Rolling with the cleanest kin

Expressing these dreams within

                                    So tell me what you're reading in(?)to


[KEVIN ABSTRACT]

Reading the fader mag I’m glad that I’m not in yet
I’m not finished yet
I think that XXL post had some niggas geekin
Frequently I’m seeing my niggas who live far away
I travel a lot
I’m 17 and I don’t babble a lot
Unless it’s on social media, awkward disease
I was gifted with
Shit, if you consider it that
Pale bitches or you know, African Black
Only way that I like em
Writing gems down
Chilling outside of Sky’s house
With who is now my ken wow, weird shit
I’m cool though, black kids at school starting to fuck with me
They think I’m getting money
Really I’m just spending money
Personally broke as fuck but in the 90s my ma lucked out
Fuck, the american dream right?
Smell like a teen right
Top down screaming out wait til I get my cream right
Let that shit breathe, you think you killing me?
Don’t view you as an enemy
My aspirations getting bigger
Sister slippin evil liquor in her liver
Label thrown on me nigga, nigga, nigga
Remove the power from the words dawg, that’s what my idols say
Momma tell me to remember what the bible say
But honestly my life is turning to a tidal wave
I’m losing my place reading this page
They say pace, pace, pace boy it’s all about pacing
It’s all about making
All about creating
Weekends spent in basements
Slaving over a mothafucking statement to the world
Middle finger to the burbs
Too much judgement going on round here
So Imma pack my bags and chase a dream for yr
Doing whatever it takes to get my point across clear
And clearly this the shit y’all ain’t tryna hear



[DOM MCLENNON]
Back with the regularly scheduled bullshit!
Blasting off a ray gun with a full clip
And aiming it at sky
Hoping to shoot the moon
Metaphors for moments where I jumped too soon
Or too late
It's too great
Time is relative when your lobes inside your skull are split in separate dimensions and you're still connecting all the dots. Don't worry if you don't follow I get that shit a lot
Pulling til my fingers hot, my totem is off it's top!
Wonder what would happen if I shot a cop by accident and if the reaction would be the same if opposite. Contemplating with all of my conglomerate, I say that a lot
But did you hear the first verse? Yah, We make that a lot
Blazed off a couple of cash crops
But really tho
Got my feet on the edge of the flat world and feeling like Columbus
Let me go explore and I can run this
Pupils gone from all this fungus
Represent for those among us who reside on the outskirts of elsewhere


TRADE OFF:
KA: Kick in the door with the gun wavin; I'm playin baby thats a piece of my imagination
DM: My world's more American McGee than Disney; middle finger to the coppers screaming coming and get me
Bumping Nas so I can blaze a 50
KA: My nigga bumpin nas we on that old Wayne shit bumpin a milli
DM: Fuckin silly to think but at the end of the day I probably would grow more in my afterlife than you would breathing what is the reason I can't believe this......[trails off]
