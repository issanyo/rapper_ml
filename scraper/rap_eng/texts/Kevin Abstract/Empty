[Verse]
Sweaty palms as I walk down this empty road
I got a mom but we ain't spoke and I don't know
I had a heart that don't speak to me anymore
And life get hard but these last days mean many more
I'm just tryna get my bands up
While you running through the banners
I don't understand us, you should find your way home
I hate my yearbook photo
I hate my passport, I hate my last name
I hate everything it stands for, I should probably fucking transfer
Blue and brown JanSport, tired of public transport
I never went to prom, now I'm stuck on the dance floor
Just holding your hand, just holding your hand

[Chorus]
And I'll be (I'll be)
Right outside your front door on my 12 speed (my 12 speed)
I got your emotions tattooed on my sleeve (my sleeve)
I think about you all the time, I've waited for you all my life
I need you right here by my side

[Bridge]
Blowin' off my mom, I don't wanna go home
I'd rather be alone, I don't wanna go home
It's getting really late so I gotta go home
Mom's blowin' up my phone so I gotta go home
I love my mom, I hate my boyfriend
Say I love my mom (I love my mom, I love my mom)
Say I hate my boyfriend (but I love my mom)

[Chorus]
And I'll be (I'll be)
Right outside your front door on my 12 speed
I got your emotions tattooed on my sleeve
I think about you all the time, I've waited for you all my life
I need you right here by my side
I'll be (I'll be)
Right outside your front door on my 12 speed (my 12 speed)
I got your emotions tattooed on my sleeve (my sleeve)
I think about you all the time, I've waited for you all my life
I need you right here by my side

[Outro]
Empty home
Empty, empty, empty home
I wanna be American
My family’s gone, but I don’t care because I love 'em
