[Intro]
Where do you go, where do you go
Where do you go when you turn your back?
I need me some more, I need me some more
I need me some more I don't know how to act

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, looking all crazy
Sipping on something that’ll make you feel amazing
You came into my room saw the posters from the 80s
You ignore me daily
Threw me shade even after jamming tape that I made ya
Nothing really major
Madonna, Nirvana, a little Cyndi Lauper
Wanna play fake doctor, we can fuck to Mariah
You can call me Messiah like, like
But you won't give me no chance ho
That’s why I can’t stand hoes
Bro said keep yo pants on
Before you end up dancing
With a baby in a hospital
And a mother in a law, and a brother in law
And a sister in law and a father in law
On god I would not mind that at all

[Chorus]
I know you blocked my number baby, baby I’m still calling
Ya daddy brought his gun out but I’m still knocking
The sun was coming back around but I’m still falling
Even though you do these things girl I know you want me

[Verse 2]
This little light of mine
Watch you until I go blind
Why you cheatin', why you lyin'
Girl you must be out yo mind
Plotting, scheming on the low
Lying, thieving, you so cold
Dreaming until we grow old
I know you hear me quit acting like you don’t
Hey, hey, girl lets go
Tell me little something that I’d like to know
Take me to a place that I’d like to go
We can stay here now the weather ain't that cold
Sing to me but use ya throat
Do that thing I know you hate
But your ass, your ass, your ass, your ass, your ass, you know I love
Is ya down to the watch the sun rise
Is ya down to let me fuck ya right
Is ya ever gon call me back
Is ya daddy still mad at fact
I won’t move my car out the drive way
Give me head on the high way
Killed my best friend, me and my bae
Sitting sideways they don't like me

[Chorus]
I know you blocked my number baby, baby I’m still calling
Ya daddy brought his gun out but I’m still knocking
The sun was coming back around but I’m still falling
Even though you do these things girl I know you want me

[Outro]
I know you blocked my number baby, baby, baby I'm still calling
You love the green but the red look awesome
I love the sex but the head was awesome
Smoke filled the room we jammed Janis Joplin
I wanna hold until we go numb
I wanna cum until it's no fun
I want a gun just to own one
What if I took your heart and made a street
What if you burnt my soul instead of your weed
Why must you do things that always make me weak
Whipe the filth off of your palms inside your mother's sink
All the love that we kept, all the secrets too
The closets open, still room for me and you
There's a war outside, no love inside
There's a guy in my mind with a nine that shine
I hope he blast it
Waiting on everything to open
Waiting on everything to open
Waiting on everything to open
Waiting on everything
On everything
