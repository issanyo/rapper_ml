[Part I: Hell]

[Verse 1]
I died in the past, I live in the present
I brag bout the future, I'mma die any second
I copped me some weapons, I keep em in the trunk
She keep that nina on her, she ain't afraid to jump
I'mma move to London, my grandma stay there
I stare to the sky, grandma kay there
Go back to Corpus, my momma pray there
Six, five, four, one
Goals done? Not at all
Standing still, I feel the fall coming
Staring in the mirror, tell myself that I donâ€™t mean nothing
My vision blurry as ever, my wrist is bloody as ever
3 A.M., still in the apartment's parking lot
My sister go to work in two hours, I go to school in three
I still ride the school bus, still ain't got no state ID
Pitty for me? Nah, nigga not at all
Tuition fees? Nigga please, finna be Bieber in the fall, motherfucker

[Bridge]
Better protect your head boy, better watch what you said boy
Before you end up dead boy, is what a wise man once said boy

[Verse 2]
Fuck twelve, fuck twelve, nigga
Rolling up until I feel different
Run through thots until my feelings missing
You moving weight from your momma's kitchen
Ain't shit change, got no range though
Still the same nigga, different area code
Keep the same circle everywhere I go
If shit gon' pop off, you know how it go
Nigga, you know how it go

[Part II: Heroina]

[Intro]
Feel it in my bones
Creeping, creeping, creeping
Fellas still not home, I won't leave him, leave him, leave him
Feel it in my bones
Creeping, creeping, creeping
Fellas still not home, I won't leave him, leave him, leave him
Feel it in my bones
Creeping, creeping, creeping
Fellas still not home, won't leave him, leave him, leave him


[Pre-Chorus]
I been, I been
So polite
I been, I been
So polite
Drugs been, drugs been
So polite
I been, I been
So polite

[Chorus]
When I die tomorrow, call my momma
At the funeral, no drama
Don't bring no tools, don't bring no heroina
When I die tomorrow, call my momma
At the funeral, no drama
Don't bring no tools, don't bring no heroina

[Verse]
My girl tells me that this shit is death
To me it feels it is all I got left
It heals my feels deep down, I don't feel wrong
Except for when I see the demon bleeding in the mirror for too long
See him, need him, write my wrongs
Treat him, leave him, like his mom
Pain here, right here, in my bones
Keep me on my toes for now
Catch me at the church in the morning in a casket
And I don't mind if I die
But I don't do it, who gon' do it?
You gon' do it, fuck that, I'mma let these drugs do it
And I'm too scared of suicide, I'm too scared of suicide
Ima let this H just take my life, I'm yelling

[Chorus]
When I die tomorrow, call my momma
At the funeral, no drama
Don't bring no tools, don't bring no heroina
And when I die tomorrow, call my momma
At the funeral, no drama
Don't bring no tools, don't bring no heroina


[Outro]
Don't bring no heroina round here, boy
Don't bring no heroina round here, boy
Don't bring no heroina round here, boy
(Don't bring no heroina)
When I die tomorrow, please no drama
Let me die in peace
