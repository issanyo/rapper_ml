[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
To fall in love with a stripper, it's so Drake-like
To fall in love with an addict, it's so me-like
My life is just like a movie (just like a movie) that you would hate to watch
I want my life to be like an episode of Baywatch

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
But it's not close to being that
I'm not close to being rap
I'm not close to being y'all
Only stay close to this gat
In case I decide to leave soon
In case I decide to go home
Only God control the storm and that's the only thing I know
So I stay on this earth, with my feet in the dirt
Mama said keep dodging church
But it's hard when I'm addicted to scrolling through Tumblr and getting on Twitter
Browsing through porn sending links to my niggas, I'm weird
