[Verse 1]
By the time I was nine
Knew the world would be mine
Always been one of kind
Still waiting for my time
But, my legs are hurting from standing in this long line
Looking at older niggas I'm better while in my prime

That's what they always ask me
Run to my dreams like athlete
Until my mind is at peace
But see
They don't really understand that
Planning on remaking this planet, until the evil just vanish

[Chorus - Kevin Abstract)
I wanna welcome you to my world
Full of diamonds and pearls
But you gotta use your imagination
Come on, get up don't worry
Let's go, please hurry
But you gotta use your imagination
Your mind is here, the time is here, let your soul be free, don't shed no tears
It's time to use your imagination
I wanna welcome you to my world
Full of diamonds and girls
But you gotta use your imagination
Come on, get up don't worry
Let's go, please hurry
Your mind is here, the time is here, let your soul be free, don't shed no tears

[Outro]
Right?
