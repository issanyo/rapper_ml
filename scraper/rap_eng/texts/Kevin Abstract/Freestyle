{VERSE}Yo dawgs,Bradley on the trap
You think you can rap but your raps are just crap
Yo you already know
It's your boy Bradley I the females
Uuhm be like Hillary Clinton and delete your emails don't use the yahoo but I use the g-mail
My rhymes are juicy my rhymes are dank
All your rhymes do is just hoist your stank (ooh)
Run it back Lil Ian on the track you tried to but its just crap
Brad hit em with the beat
