It's calm water on the lake now
As if the night stood still
Lookin' down at the stars on the water
And the pale moon and it soon filled
Everything is surreal, just the way I like it
Becomin' one with the space, I could never fight it
See I once felt against the world
But now I do my best, I bless the world
Because it bless me
I astral project to my lover
Sendin' waves of positive energy
That's me reciprocatin' everything she gives to me
I could live in your trinity 'til infinity
Small voice, symphony
Gettin' the chance to believe in you was a gift to me
But holding a flower that's never withering
So if you ask me what beauty is in my eyes
I'll tell you it's the simple things
They enhance the background
When she's a part of the bigger picture
Couldn't take advantage of her
Take her everywhere I can for a flick
Inside my headspace, the scrapbook is limitless
It's nothin' ever chosen
See it just happens on behalf of the moment

So fall hard if you ever get the chance to
For those who never cared
Fall hard if you ever get the blessing
Life is too short for regret
So fall hard if you ever get the chance to
For those who never cared
Fall hard if you ever get the blessing
Life is too short for regret
So fall hard if you ever get the chance to
For those who never cared
Fall hard if you ever get the blessing
Life is too short for regret
So fall hard if you ever get the chance to
For those who never cared
Fall hard if you ever get the blessing
Life is too short for regret
