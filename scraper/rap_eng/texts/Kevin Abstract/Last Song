[Verse 1]
Alone, it ain't always been this way
I ain't felt this much pain since the third grade
When my little brother passed and my mom asked my aunt if we could stay there
Even though seven of my cousins lay there
Ain't fair
Me and Tommy stare from across the chair
Where the teacher standing there with red hair
Would try to make us laugh shit that I remember
It's winter now, before I left I figured I could just write this down
Appreciate you for most things
You a fallen angel, born with no wings
Dommy taught me how to be a champ born with no rings
Hovie taught me how to fight through the pain like most kings
In life, most things ain't promised
Hope I see you tomorrow
Swear to God I hope I see you tomorrow
You the closest thing I ever got to callin' momma, I swear

[Chorus]
I said my days been good, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby X2

[Verse 2]
My days been cold
My heart been froze
Them TV shows
Only you and I would know
My days been good, I'm lying, I'm sorry
But K it ain't like for you to stay up in the hood
Oh you knowing me for good, you coat groping from the woods
You hoop hoppin like ya should, poppin' off like ol Suge
I think I'm starting to understand, the tales that were never told
Living every day just to grow, grow, old
Sinning every way just to feel loved
I should have never ever left ya house Auntie
Why mommy even make me have to leave the south auntie
My father's dark past still haunt
I'm my toughest critic, I still taunt me
I'll come back in the morning if you want me, Auntie, to

[Chorus]
My days been good, all the time, all the time, all the time
My days been good, all the time, all the time, all the time every(?)
My days been good, all the time, all the time, all the time every(?)
