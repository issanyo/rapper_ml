[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Yo', close the door, Rome!

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Fuck is you on? Nigga, the fuck is you on?
Grab my cell phone in the morn
Before I can even put my shoes on
I need a lifesaver, need a nice favor
Need a light changer and I might save ya'
Who am I? Little guy
Got a dream from the mind, see me right
Hit him with another line, from the night
Met a knight that'll lie, out of spite
Keep 'em high, for a dose at a time
I'ma let her give me more, hit 'em right
Hit 'em with a little [?] that'll bite
If a nigga wanna try, that is fine
That is fine, that is fine, give me mine
Go ahead, define with a sign
If I'm plottin' with a nine, I'd be lyin'
And I said, boy kill a song now now now now
Let go of my arm, let go of my arm
I don't think I have ever been norm
I don't think that these niggas have ever been warm
Killin' these niggas, what, kill myself
Same old hair with the same old belt
Skin from my dad, Frank with the iPad
That we stole from [?], can't feel myself
Like fifty niggas in the room in an empty ass home
No bitches in my room, probably gonna die alone

[Hook: Matt Champion]
God damn, god damn, I don't need none of y'all [?]
God damn, god damn, I don't need none of y'all [?]
God damn, god damn, god damn, god damn
God damn, god damn, I don't need none of y'all [?]
God damn
God damn
I don't need none of your [?], need none of you [?]
Need none of your [?], need none of you [?]
Need none of your [?], need none of you [?]

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
[?] in the mud
Get a little floody on skid
Little little get you off rip
Lilly bring the biddie little brother, run [?]
Blood, sweat drip to the chin, I'll drown
I don't really flex 'til I got it like that
'Til they're all like, "Wow, how?"
Tearin' shit down, talkin' all that, I don't hear a sound
Whoever gettin' out
Who want it like that? Who got it like that?
Who want it like that? Who got it like that?
Who want it like that? Who got it like that?
Who want it like that? Who got it like that?
No wildin' cause I know that we got it
I'm runnin' from nothin', man I'm sure that we got it
I got a bouquet of these riches
No I don't be rockin' with these bitches
High-igh-igh got me O like oh
Animal feelin' got me breakin' out the zoo
Breakin' rules, la la la
I don't hear none of your shit
I don't see none of your shit
Better not be actin' like you're on top if you're not

[Hook: Matt Champion]
God damn, god damn, I don't need none of y'all [?]
God damn, god damn, I don't need none of y'all [?]
God damn, god damn, god damn, god damn
God damn, god damn, I don't need none of y'all [?]
God damn
God damn
I don't need none of your [?], need none of you [?]
Need none of your [?], need none of you [?]
Need none of your [?], need none of you [?]

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
When it all go black, I hope you see me
Teen antichrist, I just ran a red light
Swerve left, swerve right, oh shit, my God
I just crashed my whip but I ain't spill my cup
So it's still all good
Still lost in the woods, I'm the big bad wolf
You the girl in the hood
Better watch your back 'fore you get fucked up
No reason for the blood
Let it all spill out
I'm back, bitch, like Lazarus
Like Jesus Christ on Actavis
Or the Dali Lama, poppin' mollies
Savage prophet, might block your chakras
