[Verse 1]
This that shit that we live for, young innovation
This the shit the blogs
Don't post, dodi mob nation
Amazing how they don't take us seriously I swear
A couple miles from here, is a couple gold chairs
That will lead you to the mountaintops, my homie's call it God's thumb
That's an allusion assuming that you from the generation I'm from
The penetration that comes with sitting around waiting for someone
Who don't really care about your outcome
See I'm Malcom X meets Steve Jobs
I am Quentin Tarantino meets Cam'Ron
I am everything this whole nation just been waiting on
Patiently waiting for them to activate my microphone
So I share hell stories from back home
For them ones who was them ones who couldn't ever make it home
For them ones who was them ones who had ones who didn't make it home
This is no longer my song
This right here is your anthem
Bounce

[Chorus]
Shut the fuck up
I said shut the fuck up
We said shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
I said shut the fuck up and lemme do my thang
Shut the fuck up and lemme do my thang
Shut the fuck up and lemme do my thang
Shut the fuck up and lemme do my thang


[Verse 2]
I went and built a house in the heavens
They'll probably burn it down in a second
They say you gotta get approved by the reverend
I forgot to hit the man for his blessin'
You wanna kill me, for being honest huh?
They call me filthy you think that word fits honestly?
As a description, that's your opinion
You wanna kill em?
Man, good riddance
So they'll probably shoot me down, I'm a dead man walking
They'll probably soot me down, I'm a dead man talking
I stand out when I speak out cause I'm an easy target
Hating mothafuckas see that and they have a harvest
Wanna kill em, they throw some hate up on em man
Rework ya whole style put some make up on ya, man
Freshness left it so I gotta keep the cape up on it man
See the ones out in the stands that is why I made this jam, damn

[Chorus]
Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
I said shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
I said shut the fuck up and lemme do my thang
Shut the fuck up and lemme do my thang
Shut the fuck up and lemme do my thang
Shut the fuck up and lemme do my thang


[Outro]
I went and built a house in the heavens
They'll probably burn it down in a second
They say you gotta get approved by the reverend
Well I forgot to hit the man for his blessin
Shut the fuck up
