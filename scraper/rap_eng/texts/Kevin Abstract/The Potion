[Chorus: Allan Kingdom]
I don't need no bullshit, I don't need no bullshit now
I don't need emotions, nah, they get exhaustin' now
I don't need your blueprint, I know what I'm doing now
I just need to focus, 'cause I got the potion now
I don't need no bullshit, I don't need no bullshit now
I don't need emotions, nah, they get exhaustin' now
I don't need your blueprint, I know what I'm doing now
I just need to focus, 'cause I got the potion now

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Gotta re-up, If you wanna, gotta let a nigga breath
This nigga found the potion, let it set me free
Boy I need a, sweeter, love is scrolling on to me
I'm love, your friend, cause we're
We're watching down my brain
I talk right now, but hey
You won't even look my way

[Verse 2: Allan Kingdom]
I believe in something, I believe in some things
They could get me out of the gutter
From red over to run things
Problems I could never dream of
Dirty, getting cleaned
You can't never hurt me
You just irk me 'cause I think
Who could survive like no other?
Preach your brother, teach your brother, peanut butter
Waiting on me, hating on me, under pressure
Undercover, you a lover and impressed too
And my grandma always told me I was special
Feed another, feed another, feed another
Got truth and the bars for the youth
Got juice went hard, beat the buzzer
I guess that I'm balling, I make more now that I spit
I might not be rich, but I'm shot-calling like a bitch
I might not be quick, I might be crawling, but I'ma get it
I'm about to see who at the finish
Getting fed up, I'ma win it, I'ma win it
No matter how you spin it, I'm in it

[Chorus: Allan Kingdom]
I don't need no bullshit, I don't need no bullshit now
I don't need emotions, nah, they get exhaustin' now
I don't need your blueprint, I know what I'm doing now
I just need to focus, 'cause I got the potion now
I don't need no bullshit, I don't need no bullshit now
I don't need emotions, nah, they get exhaustin' now
I don't need your blueprint, I know what I'm doing now
I just need to focus, 'cause I got the potion now
