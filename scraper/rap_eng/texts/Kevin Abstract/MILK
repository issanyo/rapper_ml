[Intro]
Dropping all I've got on this one way
I just wanna be somebody someday
Dropping all I got on this one way
I just wanna be somebody someday
Dropping all I've got on this one way
I just wanna be somebody someday
Dropping all I got on this one way
I just wanna be somebody someday

[Chorus]
I've gotta get better at being me
I've gotta get better at everything
I just want somebody that I can hang out with
Someone I can lay around chilling on my couch with

[Verse]
My life's a mosaic
Of different emotions
I have what most lack
Always feel unimportant
I may have lost some friends
And some have rose up higher
Some are six feet under
And I can't take much longer
I don't know what I'm saying
I'm always tripping over words
In my conversations
Social interactions like
Climbing thirty mountains
Without no climbing gear
And with no companions
You know I wish I could go back
And fix everything
Put a bullet through my head
That'd solve everything
But I'm only thirteen
Can't do anything
And my voice is growing weaker
Can't hear anything
But even if I'm voiceless I'll still make a change
I'll be the one writing songs that change the game
And when you see my billboard, don't ask for fame
But right now this is just a vision within my brain

[Chorus]
I've gotta get better at being me
I've gotta get better at everything
I just want somebody that I can hang out with
Someone I can lay around chilling on my couch with
