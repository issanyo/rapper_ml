[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
When I leave in the morning
Meddle in a dream with some caution
Put it on sale with an auction
Leaning on me cause that's that dope
Standing on tables, I just want attention
I believe in fables, judging from a distance
You and your shit dial, got me on my iPhone all day
Used to get kicked out the classroom
Spend it out here in the hallway
Used to write I love her much
Still ain't even 'round that cooch
If I [?] her, this too loud, let her know, let her know
Been ambitious as a child, watch me grow, watch me grow
And we mobbin' through the crowd looking like a bunch of losers
A middle finger to the [?]

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Until you die
The world so cold, what the fuck you mean now
I get a sudden feeling when you look at me now
The one motherfucker that could probably change that
Or maybe not

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Bout to hit a stripe nosed white, white striped tee
Your bitch look good from afar, but I ain't no I.D
Trash your pink Bentley, her mama will never know, no
Valley look good from afar but that shit a taint though
Rippin' on my hag, Kiko got the knives tucked
She don't wanna let me in cause we got guys that plus plus
Plus one, plus sixteen, ain't that the same shit
These bitches always bitchin bout bitchin, ain't that a bitch right
They always wanna tell me how it go, how it go
But they don't need to know how it go, how it go
Imma do my own shit behind close doors
My own shit behind close doors

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Until you die
The world so cold, what the fuck you mean now
I get a sudden feeling when you look at me now
The one motherfucker that could probably change that
Or maybe not
