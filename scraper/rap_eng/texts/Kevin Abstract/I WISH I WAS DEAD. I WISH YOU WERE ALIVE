[Intro]
Oooh, Oooh

[Verse 1]
Blow you away
When you are [?]
Get right in my bed, my bed

Oooh, Oooh

[Chorus]
So don't go back
Don't leave
Now, I'm only a [?] (Won't go back)
Now, I'm only a [?] (Won't go back)

[Verse 2]
I'll cry all the night
My big night alone
Don't leave yet
Don't leave me alone

[Chorus]
So don't go back
Don't leave
Now, I'm only a [?] (Won't go back)
Now, I'm only a [?] (Won't go back)

[Outro]
Go away, Go away
Don't leave yet (x6)
