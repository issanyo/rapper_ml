[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Mommy I love you just please let me know
When I wake up
Will all my dreams be gone?
Daddy I love you just please let me know
When I wake up
Will all my dreams be gone?
Brother I love you just please let me know
When I wake up
Will your worries be gone?
Sister I love you just please let me know
When I wake up
Will our story be told?
Mommy I love you just please let me know
When I wake up
Will our story be told?
Daddy I love you just please let me know
When I wake up
Will our story be told?

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Pray the monsters go away
Pray the monsters go away
Pray the monsters go away
Pray the monsters go away
Pray the monsters go away
Pray the monsters go away
Pray the monsters go away
Pray the monsters go away
