[Spoken: Romil Hemnani]
It's day four now, we've been in this basement for a while
Really bad weather outside, it's like fourteen inches of snow, we still down here
We running out of food, my momma leave me enough for like six days
I don't know how much longer it's gon' be
Kevin can't handle all the curry, man, it's getting pretty bad down here
He fucked up the toilet, too
Alright, man, I'm gonna report back in a few days
Hope this album gets us out the basement
Peace, fam
We smoking BIG blunts, fam! BIG blunts! Shoutout to Jon!
