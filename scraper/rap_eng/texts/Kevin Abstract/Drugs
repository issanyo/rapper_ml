[Verse 1]
She hit a bong then she gone out of this bitch
Turn my lady to a red light district
Born ugly but so got damn gifted
Only mistress, never get it twisted
She so evil, you can see it with her lipstick
You know they evil when they always be this thick
You know a sequel never come around this quick
You know a dreamer never fall in love that quick
Baby, I’m wrong, baby, I’m not
Shady I’m not, we bump Shady a lot
You turn shady so fast, MTV, oh my god
Baby a star, baby a star
I told ya, I-I-I-I told ya
I-I-I-I said I told ya
I-I-I-I said I told ya
But yo ass ain't wanna listen

[Chorus]
My baby say I do too many drugs
My mama say I'm lost up in this world
My daddy say I'm on the wrong path
But I'm trying, I'm trying, oh

[Verse 2]
She hit me then she dip off
She rip off, same shit that we sin for, get in for
Little ma went in tho, went real raw
Pulled up in the benzo, my bro's tho
Ain't got no license, pure stunt mode
Never really is invited to a club though
I stay straight on Omegle unless you bring drugs though
Red is all I see even when the drug close
Little ma the meanest, said it then I mean it
Dipset, we be jamming baby, especially when you leaning
Baby need drugs, it's the only way she breathing
Need pussy, money, weed and I'm straight for the weekend
Ignorant, ignorant, always say I’m ignorant
On god, I love it when you say I'm ignorant
Ya nude game weak, get more intimate
I’m boutta leak them pics and put you all on the internet

[Chorus]
My baby say I do too many drugs
My mama say I'm lost up in this world
My daddy say I'm on the wrong path
But I'm trying, I'm trying, oh
My baby say I do too many drugs
My mama say I'm lost up in this world
My daddy say I'm on the wrong path
But I'm trying, I'm trying, oh
My baby say I do too many drugs
My mama say I'm lost up in this world
My daddy say I'm on the wrong path
But I'm trying, I'm trying, oh
My baby say I do too many drugs
My mama say I'm lost up in this world
My daddy say I'm on the wrong path
But I'm trying, I'm trying, oh

[Bridge]
I know them other girls, they been talking 'bout
The way I do what I do
They heard I was good they wanna see if it's true
They know you're the one I wanna give it to
I can see you want me too, it's me and you
I know them other girls, they been talking 'bout
The way I do what I do
They heard I was good they wanna see if it's true
They know you're the one I wanna give it to
I can see you want me too, it's me and you

[Verse 3]
I don't need drugs no more, I don't need drugs no more
Ever since you lost your soul, you ain't ever pick up ya phone
Bro said I don't need these hoes, fuck it, I don't need these hoes
I don't need rap no more, fuck it I'ma be D Rose
I feel hopeless, you probably don't feel the same
From cocaine to the X
From religion to the sex in a church parking lot but you claimed that shit had you feeling blessed
Jamming Cassie on cassette, where the fuck you get that?
It don't matter, let's enjoy the sunset
In an hour you gon' end it off anyways
Might as well pop one and fuckin' runaway, runaway

[Chorus 2]
I know them other girls, they been talking 'bout
The way I do what I do
They heard I was good they wanna see if it's true
They know you're the one I wanna give it to
I can see you want me too, it's me and you
I know them other girls, they been talking 'bout
The way I do what I do
They heard I was good they wanna see if it's true
They know you're the one I wanna give it to
I can see you want me too, it's me and you
I know them other girls, they been talking 'bout
The way I do what I do
They heard I was good they wanna see if it's true
They know you're the one I wanna give it to
I can see you want me too, it's me and you
I know them other girls, they been talking 'bout
The way I do what I do
They heard I was good they wanna see if it's true
They know you're the one I wanna give it to
I can see you want me too, it's me and you

[Outro]
It's me and you
It's just me and you, oh
It's just us two, baby, ay-ay
It's just me and you now
It's just us two, babe
