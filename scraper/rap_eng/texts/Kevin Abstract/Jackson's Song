[Intro]
Jackson's song

[Verse One]
Cough cough cough cough cough on me
I want your diseases
I want everything that's wrong with you
I worry about what I did wrong to you
I wonder where I went wrong with you
Maybe if I write you a song or two
You'd start to believe again
Again
My friend, why do you love syringes?
I really do miss those binges
Of watching tv shows that we knew had already ended
I miss being so damn bored with you
Getting lost in the airport with you
But if I knew what you really wanted to do
I would've never cursed your name

[Hook]
I know sorry won't fix shit
I know sorry won't fix shit
I know sorry won't fix shit
You didn't mean to hurt me on Christmas

I know sorry won't fix shit
I know sorry won't fix shit
I know sorry won't fix shit
You didn't mean to kill me on Christmas

[Outro]
Yeah, Jackson's song
