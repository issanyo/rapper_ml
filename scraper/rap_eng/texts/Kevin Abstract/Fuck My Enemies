[Intro: Allan Kingdom]
Yo
Fuck everybody who doubted
Fuck everybody I tried to be friends with
Fuck all of you
I love you
Thank you

[Hook: Allan Kingdom]
Should've known, it's fuck my enemies
Should've known not to trust your energy
Should've known, it's fuck the industry
Should've known, should've known, you gon' remember me
Should've known, it's fuck my enemies
Should've known not to trust your energy
Should've known, it's fuck the industry
Should've known, should've known, you gon' remember me

[Verse 1: Allan Kingdom]
Yeah I tried to show some love to my enemy
But I should've stay home like I'd rather be
Jealousy got you tryna get ahead of me
Niggas kissing all that ass, Human Centipede
When my numbers on low, you forgetting me
When I blow, you gon' blow me like a Kennedy
Got a little more dough now you hella geeked
Yeah all these lil hoes got you hella geeked

[Bridge: Allan Kingdom]
Should've known, it's fuck my enemies
Should've known, should've known, since elementary
Should've known you not ahead of me
Could've known, so how could I let you get to me?
Should've known, should've known some fucking memories
Don't regret your energy was never meant for me
Should've known that you were less than me
You offended me but you could never threaten me

[Hook: Allan Kingdom]
Should've known, it's fuck my enemies
Should've known not to trust your energy
Should've known, it's fuck the industry
Should've known, should've known, you gon' remember me
Should've known, it's fuck my enemies
Should've known not to trust your energy
Should've known, it's fuck the industry
Should've known, should've known, you gon' remember me

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
My big homie spending money like it's 1996
I just got some custom golds and my teeth still ain't fixed
Fuck niggas who want everything I got though
Bitch, do it look like I just won the lotto?
Cam'ron still my idol, nigga
Pink is like the bible, nigga
High within the righteous scriptures 'cause these boys got it out for me
My head is dangling off this fucking balcony
I hope my enemy
Will at least pick a nice weapon
And let me look at it before you 'cide to dissect me
I retire from the mic so you can direct me
I been trying to be in Fader since I was like 15
Sixth grade, Soulja Boy told me I could be anything
So any nigga that tell me different wasn't fucking listening
We cut from different cloths though
You motherfuckers lost out
I want a drug, a partner and a home in Palo Alto
It's gon' take a sec for y'all niggas to learn to work though

[Hook: Allan Kingdom]
Should've known, it's fuck my enemies
Should've known not to trust your energy
Should've known, it's fuck the industry
Should've known, should've known, you gon' remember me
Should've known, it's fuck my enemies
Should've known not to trust your energy
Should've known, it's fuck the industry
Should've known, should've known, you gon' remember me

[Outro: Allan Kingdom]
I sat on this side and I think about it by myself now
Talking 'bout
It's hard to fuck with you
Fuck niggas, fuck niggas
It's hard to fuck with you
