[Verse 1]
He was everything I dreamed of
Used to ride around in his two seater
Being friends didn't make it much easier
Friday night lights, stay away from the bleachers
Showed me obscure bands he was into
His mom in the dining room, we're in his bedroom
His girl too, had to pretend like I ain't mind that bitch
Just so I could see his face
He introduced me to all his friends
I thought they were cooler than anyone I'd ever met before
Dressed well and we made a band
Honey moons and smoke breaks in a mini van
We'd drive through our trouble bubble
Screaming at mansions
Football pads become a memory
Football pads become a memory
A bad memory

[Pre-Chorus]
You changed me for the better
You changed me for the better

[Chorus]
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again

[Verse 2]
Known you for some time but it feels brand new
Try and go forget but we did that too
And I won't ever let you go
Ay, dog, got some problems we could runaway from
Search for a tree that you could hang on, stay down
Watch myself, watch myself watching you you

[Pre-Chorus]
You changed me for the better

[Chorus]
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
