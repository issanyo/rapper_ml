[Intro]
Yeah
They
They, They
They

[Verse 1]
They go by, they don't seem to go fast enough
Same old things, but nothing's really adding up
I hate my bus driver, but still trying to catch the bus
He can see me running, and I still ain't catching up
Maybe when I leave, Mom and Dad will try to patch it up
Maybe when I'm free, I'm afraid I won't have enough
I need to hear a friend, but my headphones tangled up
My heart shaped box is a blank, so I'm packing up

[Bridge]
I try
Hi, bye
My life
Ain't right
Know you waste your time
I lie
To your eyes
Who'll save you from all my lost time (Now, now)

Side-eyed wise guy, my mind stay blind
I take no advice (It's out now)
Bye bye free time, just to freeze time
Might need a little more time (It's out now)

[Pre-hook]
I want to be alright again
Never met someone so perfect
Do you want to be with me again
Try to remember you're perfect

[Hook]
You're perfect, picture (Ha-aa-ah)
You're perfect, picture (Ha-aa-ah)
You're perfect, picture (Ha-aa-ah)
You're perfect, picture (Ha-aa-ah)
You're perfect, picture (Ha-aa-ah)
You're perfect, picture (Damn)
You're perfect, picture  (To be with you)
You're perfect

[Outro]
Hmm, mm-mm, mmm aa-aah
Hmm, mm-mm, mmm aa-aah
Hmm, mm-mm, mmm aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ah
Hmm, mm-mm, mmm aa-aah
