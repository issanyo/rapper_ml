[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Shoot 'em dead, split the wish bone
Bad luck, spilled the weed on the carpet
No more baby-sitting, no more homework
No more van rides to the mountains with the GameCube taped up
Take the auto down the block
With the scratches on the door, CD no aux
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn, slow burn, slow burn

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Where do I go when I die?
What if I spend my whole life
Being a bad-ass boy with a crate on the side
I keep my face in my lap, wanna sit in the back
My mom driving around, we got church in an hour
Where do I go when I die?
What if I spend my whole life
Being a bad-ass boy with a crate on the side
I keep my face in my lap, when I sit in the back
My mom driving around, we got church in an hour

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
On sight, when I pull up to the light
My bike sound like Skype (woo-woo)
I don't write, I just pull it out the sky
I was there for attendance then I died
On sight, when I pull up to the light (skrrr-ra)
My bike sound like skype (woo-woo)
I don't write, I just pull it out the sky
I was there for attendance then I died

[Interlude: Joba (& Ryan Beatty)]
I just wanna know, where the love at?
Where the— Where the love at?
I just wanna know, where the love at?
Where the— Where the love at?
I just wanna know, where the love at?
Where the— Where the love at?
I just wanna know, where the love at?
Where the— Where the love at?
I just wanna know, where the love at?
Where the— Where the love at?
I just wanna know, where the love at?
Where the— Where the love at?
I just wanna know, where the love at?
Where the— Where the love at?
I just wanna know, where the love at?
Where the— Where the love at?
I just wanna know, where the love at? (I know where the love is at)
Where the— Where the love at? (I know where the love is at)
I just wanna know, where the love at? (I know where the love is at)
Where the— Where the love at? (I know where the love is at)
