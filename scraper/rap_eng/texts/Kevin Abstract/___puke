[Verse 1]
See the fire in my eyes
And believe, its dangerous outside
I know I'm doing something wrong
Know I'm doing something wrong

[Chorus]
Put a gun to my face tell em reload it
Ain't a thing but a bang then I don't see shit
Finna run thru the flame, better hold me back
Really hope I never ever gotta see you again

[Verse 2]
You only care about your phone
Well two can play that game
Ooh you so far from home
Yeah If I'm back
If I'm back yeah
Where ya crawling at, where ya crawling at
If I react, If I react yeah

[Chorus]
Put a gun to my face tell em reload it
Ain't a thing but a bang then I don't see shit
Finna run thru the flame, better hold me back
Really hope I never ever gotta see you again
