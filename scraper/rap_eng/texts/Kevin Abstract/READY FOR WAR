[Intro: Joba]
Baby child
Lift your head and free your mind
Open up your eyes, and you'll find you will fly
Just smile sometimeâ€”welcome to the real world

[Verse 1: Joba]
Everybody pray for peace when they don't have the power
A disconnect of intellect
Know some people packing straps, you would call them cowards
The realest G's I ever met
Not on the gangster shit, not on the paper shit
Just on that "have to provide for my kids and shit"
There's blood on the streets
And if I had a dream, I would do anything
I make mistakes
The shit that you hear about ain't just in movies, dog
I've seen some shit
Bag 'em up in body bags, zip 'em up and send 'em
Away from the kids
I know good felons, good drug dealers, good people
Bad system, bad people with power
If you gotta dream and you know what that means
You can do anything, just make a change

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Sometimes I think back to that ninth grade campus
White boy made fun of my lips, I should've thrown a tantrum
But I remained cool cause he was way too handsome
Now I'm out in Beverly Hills using a mansion as my canvas
I bought a helicopter, threw that bitch on stage
RCA gave us money, we ain't throw it away
We took that shit, we flipped that shit
We made this company pop
They like me, I want 'em to love me like them niggas love Pac
I'm De La Soul, Tribe Called Quest
We be openin' sets inside a G-Unit vest
I moved way out to the West side, but still got the South in my heart
They murdered Selena, now them niggas looking for God
Dressed like a soldier, told ya, they don't know who we are
My vest is on, let 'em know we ready for war
In the club with my boyfriend
We paranoid 'cause, we might get popped
'Cause a nigga on some bullshit
Why you wanna hate me now or ask the skies to lay me down?
I hear my brother praying now
I really need an angel now, some type of holy savior
Ayo, Dad, do me a favor, could you pick me up later?

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I've been exploring through the Joyful
The Sorrowful and Glorious Mysteries
The story is romanticized, notorious victories
The visions say the scorpion was born as a centipede
That partnered with the succourless to poison their enemies
I tap it down like telegrams with telepathy
To share the bare necessities or own my discrepancies
Can see my Macbook pages spillin' onto the melody
'Cause the margins 'round the pen couldn't keep up with my elegant, uh
I kept that devil in my sextant, never fall behind
That's how we always stayed ahead, the flow of my design
The higher that you climb, the more destructive your decline
I'm well aware that on this day I have to quantify
So tell me if you really think you're so realistic
And rappers pray for me to not preparing on my district
They shouting hands-up while they deploying their ballistics
We shouting hands-up and kids want me to go ballistic
The difference in our league of extraordinary minorities
Against the identity, representing authority
Woo Bertina Macauley and clutch my rosaries
Before they try and steal 'em off of me, that's more for me
That's what the forerunners told me: "This is not your speed!"
While they repeated they beliefs from the Apostle's Creed
The most consistency I found in life has never come from people
Still looking for an equal, nobody will believe you

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
God ain't give me a penny, I made a million dollars
I got a thug for a father so I took care of my mother
God threw me in fire, I walked out with my brothers
You know the Shadow of Death?
I was born in the valley, but now I live in The Valley
God gave me a house, God gave me depression
God gave us life but we ain't know it was cursed
I was hurt as a child, you know I still deal with it
Now I'm a grown-ass man with immature-ass feelings
All I wanted was money, just to get it and spend it
On strippers and weed, I ain't skip on the liquor
I can't talk to my niggas 'cause if I say it, it's real
And I ain't ready to face it, I've been flirtin' with Satan
I've been flirtin' with women that like to dance when they naked
And I throw all of my dollars, I throw all of my problems
To the back of my throat with weed smoke and Klonopin
I'm ashamed of myself
About three days ago I planned on killing myself
But I'm still here breathin', you know I'm still here screamin'
Screamin', "Fuck that shit", we signed for fifteen million
And I almost missed it, I know that y'all niggas hear me

[Outro: bearface]
We found a light
Will you still carry me?
When I fall
Let the hope and the joy
Rain down on me
Rain down on me (ooh)
Raise me up
Carry, carry, carry me
