(Prod. Romil)

[Verse]
15 weapons
I can change your life in 15 seconds
I was 15 when I realized the damage
I was 16 when I moved to Atlanta
Metro, my view foggy still
Vomit on the ground yelling out to my mommy still
Will daddy?
Is daddy here ever?
And the holes inside my skin don’t make me feel no better
Fake leather that them niggas sold back at home in Corpus
The crib we had on Brockhampton made all us feel enormous
I feel closed in and boxed in now
No disrespect to my sister, but I need to get out
Lemme light that cigarette now, watch me not put it to my mouth
But watch it die though, just like all of us
We all gon' die slow, phone home to Ohio
Is Scott here?
I think that Scott here cause he the only that seem to care about us
"Where the love at? Where the trust at?"
Used iMessage to send my main bitch that, she still ain't hit me back
I'mma pretend this gat is the place I’m supposed to lay my head at
Lemme take this nap

[Bridge]
If you want me dead, gon' head and shoot me down
If you want me dead, gon' head and kill me now
And I’ve been dead
I’ve seen so many legs, arms, tear apart
How did this start?
How did this start?
How did this start?
How did this start?

[Outro]
You think it’s wrong for me to die?
Shit, I’ve been dead my whole life
I'm still searching for what’s right
But we all know I ain’t right
Gotta stay focused, aye
(You can cut it now.)
