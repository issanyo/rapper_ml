[Intro]
Give yourself a round, you don't love yourself
That's why you're all alone and always by yourself
Syringe your only friend, but it won't help you now
I can see it in your skin, your demons showing out

[Verse 1]
Black sand, pink moon
I'm hoping you would think soon
It's only three weeks before eviction, then we move
"Tell me you would miss me, tell me you would miss me
Okay, Kevin, then prove it to me, uh, kiss me
Probably be on the news tomorrow if you'd dare to diss me."
The baby mama drama that we kept inside our kitchen
All her friends was listening, tryna catch attention
Oh, you so cold, the truth unknown, no

[Pre-Chorus]
The red wall, the waterfall
And the red wall, wasn't ready for it at all

[Chorus]
Is it love that we're fighting for?
Do I trust you enough with my soul? Who I
Really am is not enough
This ain't love, distant love, oh

[Verse 2]
My week's been going slow
It's something 'bout this hoe
She don't like when I call her that though
It's okay, you are my world, girl
And not much changes, slang words just words from a nigga's
Marriage, she don't like to kick it with us
She been tryna not get too much pretentious
But she the bomb and she know it
Her hair bomb, and she know a nigga know it
Yeah, and she know a nigga love it
We be doing drugs all out in the public
Stumbling in publics, talking the rubbish and I love it

[Bridge]
The red wall, the waterfall
And the red wall, wasn't ready for it at all

[Chorus]
Is it love that we're fighting for?
Do I trust you enough with my soul? Who I
Really am is not enough
This ain't love, distant love, oh

[Transition]
Is it love that we're fighting for? (Tell me what we're fighting for)
Do I trust you enough with my soul? Who I
Really am is not enough
This ain't love, distant love, oh
Is it love that we're fighting for? (Tell me what we're fighting for)
Do I trust you enough with my soul? Who I
Really am is not enough
This ain't love, distant love
Is it love that we're fighting for?
Do I trust you enough with my soul? Who I
Really am is not enough
This ain't love, distant love, oh

[Verse 3]
It's that boy from school that robbed them fools that
Messed with that little girl, cause
All of em do that, you holding you back
Addicted to the thrill, love it if it ain't real
Fuck it, that's how you feel
Momma hate that you steal
It gave her body chills when she saw the thrills
When she saw the pills on the kitchen counter
All the pain around her, all the blood surround her
Keep her down and out, but
When the lights is out, bruh, what you gonna do?
Daddy is on the move, still bang out after school
Hang around all them fools
Oh, you think you so cool, oh, you think you so cool?
Oh you think you that dude
Oh, you think that you rule?
This little bubble town, think you the man around?
You got it figured out?
Your brother's crying out, your sister's crying out
Your daddy's crying loud, and I'm to blame now

[Outro]
And when it come, it's gon' come with a storm
And when you fly, better fly to the sun
And quit that crying now, boy, escape that island now, boy
Dry your eyelids young boy, the horizons sighing now, boy
And when it come, it's gon' come with a storm
And when you fly, better fly to the moon
And quit that hiding now boy, escape that island now, boy
Dry your eyelids, young boy, the horizons dying now, boy
