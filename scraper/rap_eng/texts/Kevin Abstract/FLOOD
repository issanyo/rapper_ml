[Intro]
Oooh, Oooh
Oooh, Oooh

[Verse 1]
Darlin' you said that we're dusty
Visions of that, I won't forget
I wanna look out
I wanna look out, and flood

[Interlude]
Oooh, Oooh
Oooh, Oooh

[Verse 2]
I can swear there's something in your voice
I never wanna leave
I'll live forever, choice
And make you stay with me

[Chorus]
Poison
Won't you come back again?
Don't save it (Don't you stay)
Don't go looking for me

[Post-Chorus]
(Can't you) Can't you stay?
Won't you come back again? (Won't you come back today?)
Tremble (Don't you stay)
[?] you now (Oooh)

[Chorus]
Poison
Won't you come back again?
Don't save it (Don't you say)
Don't go looking for me

[Post-Chorus]
(Can't you) Can't you stay?
Won't you come back again? (Won't you come back today?)
Tremble (Don't you stay)
[?] you now (Oooh)
