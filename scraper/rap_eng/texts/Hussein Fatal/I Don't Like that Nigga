[Verse 1]
Man I can't stand Hussein, put that punk to sleep
That nigga fucked my little sister at the comfort suite
Got her pregnant and e'rything, and he ain't even claim it
I do it for any price, right now just name it
10 years ago he rapped with Pac, he still think he famous
Well I'ma roll 'em over with the stainless
Look at him stuntin', frontin' over there at the bar, like a star
He ain't even got a car, and they get in clubs they charge
But maybe that's why he hood?
Fuck that nigga, I heard he treat his lil' homies no good
But that's the nigga they kill fo', and I'ma keep it real though
The Outlawz jerked him, so he ain't really getting real dough
Fuck that he got something, and I wanna take it
I ain't hating, because he got put on, but I wanna make it
This nigga rollin' through the hood like he Akbar, prayin' something
Everybody feelin' him, so ain't nobody saying nothing
Fuck that shit, he gonna die like me
Around here, I ain't trying to let him shine like me
So when I catch him, I'ma stretch him
And put him where he 'posed to be
I hate him, and I don't want that pussy nigga close to me

[Hook]
I don't like that nigga, I should kill him right now
I don't like his style, and he always stuntin', that nigga foul
I should kill him right now man, I don't like that nigga, he stay in the hood
Big guns, heavy everyday in the hood
I don't like that nigga, that nigga foul
I should kill him right now

[Verse 2]
He so real, it's a goddamn shame
Some fake thugs in the hood want a bullet in his goddamn name
But when they see him in person, they repeating his verses
Telling him how he hot, and if he don't eat then it's worthless
So go ahead try to snap on him
I'ma leave that warning
Just seen him in Tabel lounge with the MAC on him
With a couple of the homies from up top
Pine street bloodz, across the street on the bus stop
Just waitin' for you suckers to inch wrong
I saw the haters standing there with the waist slim chin chon
Fuck that, somebody needs to stop him before I do
You know the rule all the time, but he ain't poppin' from my crew
That nigga better stay out of the hood
And I ain't bullshitin', he better stay as faraway as he could
Any questions he got, I'ma answer with the forty
At Deco lounge wit shoes on, dancin' with my shorty
I heard, I knew that
Maybe she pushed up on a nigga? Nah shorty wouldn't do that
But I'm talking about the way he be out
Starin' at me, ridin' by shooting rocks, like he playin' me out
And his boys don't even like him, I know some niggas from the 'Clair
Fightin' humble niggas use to sit up on the tier
And talk about him recklessly
So I know he a snake, I don't want that nigga next to me

[Hook]
I don't like that nigga, I should kill him right now
I don't like his style, and he always stuntin', that nigga foul
I should kill him right now man, I don't like that nigga, he stay in the hood
Big guns, heavy everyday in the hood
I don't like that nigga, that nigga foul
I should kill him right now

[Verse 3]
Man that nigga always talking about the shit that he touched
All the shit he did with his man, and all the bitches he fucked
I wish Kadafi would've never introduced him to Pac
I know that nigga, they called him Dirty Bruce on the block
But wasn't he getting money with some nigga named Rich?
Yeah, but after that he was back to the same shit
All of them niggas changed, man all of them niggas strange
He came around this bitch, and took all of them niggas range
Ain't nobody say shit, but they talking it now
Finny Mitchell had some niggas in the park on the ground
And he ain't get on the floor, he played his part with a frown
Yeah! Where my party gon start? When he down?
He the best that's what it is, I'ma call for his crown
And I ain't know him back then, so I'ma start with him now
I bought a brand new forty, when I see him it's on
I ain't only blowin' the horn, I'ma leave him a storm
I'ma do his ass dirty, in the evilest form
Next time you hear about him, I guarantee you he gone
This nigga rollin' through the hood like he Akbar, prayin' something
Everybody feeling him, so ain't nobody saying nothing
I don't like that nigga
