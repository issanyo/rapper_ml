[Verse 1]
I met a lot of women on the road
My pimping is world wide
And everybody knows, uh
But something about her
Makes me wanna slow it
Spend a little more time
I like that she has a mind on her
I gotta get her
Won't, stop till I got her
She focus, she go to school
She works from ten to two, he-yo
Cus shawty, Cus Shawty, Cus Shawty's fly
I can use someone like you by myside
As long as your a rida,rida, I can lowa you down
Or provider, vider, baby are you down
So you should get to know me
Little Mama
So tell me , what its gonna be, little mama

[Pre-Chorus]
Hoppin on ride, In the passenger side
I'll show you just how to roll
Come kick with me tonight eh-yo
Dont be afraid
Everything is alright
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-no

[Chorus]
She wanna come with me
Little mama wanna rock and see
What do we have here now
Now do you ride or die tonight?
She wanna come with me

[Verse 2]
Little mama, wanna run, quick see
What do we have here now
