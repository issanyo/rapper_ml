[Intro]
Yeah, I know it's long overdue, Hussein Fatal, Thugtertainment, you know what I'm saying?
It's a letter to my homeboy, it's my dog, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout, it's my dog
Since the air ways been clear for like ten years, I thought I write him a letter

[Verse 1]
Dear Pac, I shed a teardrop, missin' you and Yak for years
You changed my life man, I wish I was there
That night up in the MGM Grand, can't understand
They gang bangin', nobody had a gun in they hand
Shot you down in the streets, like President Kennedy
And we still pourin' Hennessy out for your memory
Setcha calmed down, Malik gettin' grown now
Resemble E.D.I a little bit, but he got his own style
Roddy shot Yak, Mu took the Shahada
I had another baby girl, and I named her Assata
Her middle name your last name, her family tree
I can't help but think where we would be
Out on Crenshaw, Slauson, flossin' how we used to
Ridin' down sunset, bangin' the Juice Crew
Everybody takin' your songs and remixin' 'em
Mixtapin' them joints so we don't get chips from 'em
Haters still hatin', I can't get no air play
There’s rumors that you still here, but that’s just hearsay
Snoop ain't reachin' out to us, neither is Suge
He catchin' slack over your murder, so he ain't doin' good
Noble and E.D.I still on the grind
And Keisha doin' her thang, and Nutt-So keep it real all the time
Niggas miss you with them Sunkist sodas and all your jokes
The older brother I never had, nigga the dope
The greatest of all times, actin', rhymes
Politically speaking, no silly ass punchlines
Treach took it hard when they murked you
Brought us closer together though
'Cause now he a part of my circle, nigga we miss you

[Interlude]
Straight up, I know I can speak for all the homies on this side We all miss you
And it's more than just a song, my nigga, 'cause that ain't 'bout nothin'
We did 400 of those in one year, ya heard me?

[Verse 2]
Ain't nobody lookin' out, I know they all hated you
I wonder how shit woulda been if you'da made it through
I can't believe they got you, you know how me and Yak do
I'da rolled out on them niggas before they popped you
And everybody feel us, but ain't feelin' the pain
I'm up against all odds, but I'm still in the game
What's wrong with these poo putts, how it's all over?
And I'll come out squeezin', if I can start it all over
The mainstream ain't feelin' the laws, and seem weird now
We don't get the spins like before, 'cause you ain't here now
Only God can judge me, would tell that to these niggas
Learned one thing from Death Row, and that's how to read niggas
But now I'm back home on the East Coast
They know I'm 'bout that thug life, so I keep my heat close
At least most wanted, niggas like us don't live too long
That's why I had to put this pain in this song
And if nothin' else, tell Storm, Yak, Gade, and Big
I'll see 'em soon but for now, later my nigg
Pac, I miss you nigga

[Outro]
And we still mobbin' out here for all y'all
One love to all y'all niggas though
