[Intro: Girl]
I mean what?
People going crazy over this?

[2Pac talking]
It don't stop, keep goin'
It don't stop, keep goin'

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now I been called crazy, to fade me it's not possible
I give a fuck, what you thought, or who you brought witchu?
A Bad Boy killer, Biggie annihilator
They wonderin' why he breathin', but bitches is dyin' later
Better laugh now, then cry when I come to get you
I hit you with two Glocks, and leave you with scar tissue
On some loco shit, my pistol smoke yo' shit
Let's go for dolo bitch, and watch me flow yo' shit
Mr., Makaveli movin' pieces like telekinesis
It's like a chess game, let's play wit' real pieces
Shots rang and niggas brains was spilled
Another Bad Boy affiliator nigga was killed
I hit the funeral and bust at his folks
And leave the scene like a shadow in a blaze of smoke
It don't stop, keep goin'

[Hook: Hussein Fatal & 2Pac]
Don't stop, don't stop, keep goin'
It don't stop, keep goin'
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, keep goin'
It don't stop, keep goin'
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, keep goin'
It don't stop, keep goin'
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, keep goin'
It don't stop, keep goin'
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, keep goin'
It don't stop, keep goin'

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
Shit, still grindin for the chips
I come from the clear but you can find him in the bricks
Me, I was the diamond in the sticks
And him, he hatin' and still whinin' 'cuz I'm grindin' with his bitch
Out shinin' with the sixth, I'ma blind him with the fifth
He still sellin' nicks, what he tryin' to throw a disc?
I promise you'll be lyin' on your strip
'Cuz copyin' my style, whippin' any 9 you can get
No crime on the strip, just dimes of the pit
No gimmicks to my music, you be lyin' when you spit
Outta line you get gripped, I'ma find you a ditch
Right next to your OG, do your time with a snitch
And I tell 'em all the time you a bitch
A real life pussy, hit the strip, go and find you a dick
Man this nigga outta line who is this?
I'm tempted to put his mind on his kicks
Let the 9 do the trick, yeah

[Hook: Hussein Fatal & 2Pac]
Don't stop, don't stop, keep goin'
It don't stop, keep goin'
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, keep goin'
It don't stop, keep goin'
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, keep goin'
It don't stop, keep goin'
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, keep goin'
It don't stop, keep goin'
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, keep goin'
It don't stop, keep goin'
