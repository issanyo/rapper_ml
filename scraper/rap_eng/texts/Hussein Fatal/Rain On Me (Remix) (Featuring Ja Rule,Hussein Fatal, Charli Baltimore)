[Intro:Ashanti]
Yeah
Murder Inc
We invite you to… epic, ya know?
We make music out of a sense of hunger
Sort of a desire
Through that desire
We expose the pain and struggle
But we accustom to live it
So, we feel without this music, we have nothing
So we offer you, well… we offer you our lives
So how you gon' take it?

[Verse 1: Ashanti]
See everybody wanna rise to the top these days
[Top these days]
A lot of people might come and try to take your place
[Take your place]
Oh you know that
All you gotta do is keep rising, rising
Don’t look back and keep shining, shining
I had a little struggle
I had a little pain
Now make it rain, make it rain, make it rain

Now I'm watching every nigga watchin me closely he doesn't know
He best know how I’m rollin before he approach me
These bitches know they can't easily provoke me and and in any case toast me and know
We should rearrange apolstery dont sleep never catch chuck
Slippin on nuttin I'm spittin so long as the scotti pimpin on from
I'm dippin on nothin under $250 im flippin songs like tha spirit of
Escabon with me I gotta take this game once before they forget me
But i reign swift lane shift doin above 60 fuck with me better livin
Imma do my bidin till they come get me i ride even on empty still built, don't let me bin me on me

[Hussein Fatal:]
This is what it is when you step and fail
Sprawled out 70 staples
From neck to navel
When you man flip the mobile need a extra hater talkin way over
Budget dog check the label e.m.s. on the scene grab the
Sketch n save em now you look to these electric chambers im

[Ja Rule]
I'm incredible on my crime niggas

Just in the nick of time rippin a nickel nine

Tell em shit when they die
Keep it shivering one shot to the liver is serious to the ER emergency, i see you surgery
But I been Livin' Livin' this life i was givin prayin to God in every religion lookin to get aquitted
Open and shut case and murders the crime it bring pain and life crise rule's crucified
Bitch you mistakin while the whole world awaits me to die
I ressurected and reincarnate with blood in my eye
I talk into my love and my passion and I'm tired of askin questions that can't get answered
So I'm gonna rain on this industry the stocks smashin
Cause after the tears are gone theres nothing but laughter lord....
