[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wanting it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me feening
Body talking shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me - Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is banging baby I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it

[Hook: 2Pac]
How do you want it?
How does it feel?
Coming up as a nigga in the cash game
Living in the fast lane
I'm for real
How do you want it?
How does it feel?
Coming up as a nigga in the cash game
Living in the fast lane
I'm for real

[Verse 2: Hussien Fatal]
Allow me to introduce to ya, I'm Fatalveli The Don
Tattooed all on my back, neck, belly and arms
I'm tryin' to talk to ya, give me the stash, 107.5 'bout to do the whole dash back with 'Pac in the house now
Give it to me, bet you love that nigga whip it out and put it in your mouth now
Grindin' rawdy, holdin' nine inches in ya shorty
Even your baby mama if she keep it poppin' for me
Her brains is bangin', shorty I love the way you want it
Time to give it to Dizza, Baby now tell me how ya want It

[Hook: 2Pac]
How do you want it?
How does it feel?
Coming up as a nigga in the cash game
Living in the fast lane
I'm for real
How do you want it?
How does it feel?
Coming up as a nigga in the cash game
Living in the fast lane
I'm for real

[Verse 3: Big Seth]
Whenever Big seth rolled with 'Pac
He controlled the block
Hoodboogers on every set when I hold or cock
They love when they see me thugging with my drug men
Lubricate they miss section, keep 'em bubbling
Mama that walk is mean, my hawkish lean
One to 9 hit the loop and off to them things
I gotta about 9 inches that's brown and bold
So shorty come on my block and these on down the road
Once I bust this release some slushes
You can watch the hammer but you still can't touch this
Till the next time, I'll get up
Back at the club with DJ Qualls looking for the wildest sluts
How do ya want it

[Hook: 2Pac]
How do you want it?
How does it feel?
Coming up as a nigga in the cash game
Living in the fast lane
I'm for real
How do you want it?
How does it feel?
Coming up as a nigga in the cash game
Living in the fast lane
I'm for real
