[Verse 1: Hussein Fatal]
Tattoos mark up my body 'cause they cover my gun wounds!
And yeah I got that thang 'cause I know I be done soon!
No I ain't sell my soul, I ain't rattle nobody
Either refuse to put my life on somebody
Either these cowards be trippin' baby
If I don't make it home tonight
Kiss Assata and tell her daddy got it on tonight
If it's meant to be I be back the same way she was sending me
And I ain't gotta finish the century, gotta 'em history
Handling this life like if I got this bitch by the handle
DEA wanna kill 'em, they can't get to the scandal
Thug niggas surrounded by nothin' by drug dealers and gang bangers
Blocka Blocka will plug niggas

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
Shit, sixteen in the parking lot, one in the trailer
Niggas escaping out of town but only running from failure
Me I face it and replace it with some basic g-shit
'Cause running ll get you heated, got you making teeth clipped
'Bout my fetti I told you, I need my cash in abundance
Ain't no stoppin' the kingpin I'm on that ass and I want it
Preach war like Khalid Muhammad, just on phonic
This AK spitting with the don behind it
This music ll have you lose it, if you ain't on the right track
And if you ain't built you pro'ly won't get you life back
I'm begging you pussy niggas trying to start
Leave a Tallon in your chest that'll explode like two inches from your heart
Holla

[Verse 3: Hussein Fatal]
Yeah, it's a war on the bricks and I'm rich I ride
With a forty and afford the whip
It's a movement every time we move cray all the risk
And we poppin' the radio, don't even pay over for this
Get the Henny back poppa pretty boy, it's over for Cris'
And Biggie and 2Pac gon' even roll over the hits
Gotta flow full of opium so is the bricks
Think the homie is got 'em spitting like this?
Knows the chicks
