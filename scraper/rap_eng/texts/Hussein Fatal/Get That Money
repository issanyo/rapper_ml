[Hook: Mr. Bo'z & Kasinova Tha Don]
Get that money, get that money
Get that money, get that money
Get that money, get that money
Get that money, yo, get it
Get that money, get that money
Get that money, get that money
Get that money, get that money
Get that money, yo, get it
All we do is get money all day
(Living fast life in the fast lane)
(Living in the fast lane)
Pour 'em cups, put ya hands up, let me
Let me get a P-Funk if it's okay, P-Funk

[Verse 1: Mr Bo'z]
Drop verse after verse, and hook after hook
I'm like Rick and Ross, 'cause I push then I push
Read up on the Bo'z come look in my book
See me sour the diesel then kushing the kush
She shaking, she shaking, I got my eyes on the tush
My money talks so I would advise you to shush
I'm from NY, official Queens
So if you talk dirt, I'll be there with Listerine, go get your teeth
Now everybody steady watching like I'm in the screen
Mr. Bo'z 'bout to shine like Mr. Clean
It ain't a dream, P-Funk's the team, so we the best
Every climbing up, yes, baby, we don't need the fence
More riches than a treasure chest
Since I make it rain, I'ma forecast the weather next
I make it healthy y'all, 'cause I'm counting hella checks
In the helicopter, that's why them haters is hella vexed

[Hook: Mr. Bo'z & Kasinova Tha Don]
Get money, money, get it
Get money, money, get it
Get money, money, get it
Get money, yo, get it
Get money, money, get it
Get money, money, get it
Get money, money living the life in the fast lane
All we do is get money all day
(Living fast life in the fast lane)
(Living in the fast lane)
Pour 'em cups, put ya hands up
Let me get a P-Funk if it's okay, P-Funk

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
You ain't getting money, you ain't getting shit
You just a sucka nigga sucking other niggas' dicks
You ain't a rushed dude, and you ain't rolling hard
And in the prison half you niggas wouldn't go to yard
Makaveli trained, getting praised, got brains
I ain't feeling y'all, don't get it twisted, your boy still a hog
And I'll get my weed from twenty year
And I'll smoke thirtys, and dirty niggas I don't be getting money with
Holla and I throw you a brick
Holla harder, I'ma throw you strip
You wanna problem? I'ma throw you a clip, yeah!
The government can never play me
Named my daughter Assata, I'll name the next one Afeni
Hardcore, ain't nothin' but the bricks
And that dope money, ain't nothin' but the bricks
In this brick money, ain't nothin' but the bricks
And the closest you come to the 'burbs is them ducts you with
Yeah!

[Hook: Mr. Bo'z & Kasinova Tha Don]
Get money, money, get it
Get money, money, get it
Get money, money, get it
Get money, yo, get it
Get money, money, get it
Get money, money, get it
Get money, money living the life in the fast lane
All we do is get money all day
Living fast life in the fast lane
Living in the fast lane
Pour 'em cups, put ya hands up

[Verse 3: Kasinova Tha Don]
I woke up fiending for cream, and now my dreams being made from a young nigga, stuck in his ways, I'm getting paid
From rags to riches, bustin' at fags and snitches
Collectin' money with heart, I had to mash on bitches
Labeled as a menace, the way we moving handle business
Thank God for Jehovah, can a nigga get a witness?
This is hell, fuck jail, in reality you couldn't tell
Niggas catch a homicide just to make a sale
Mama dropped me at an early age
It's kinda crazy 'cause I'm heading for an early grave
Or [?] maybe, it was wrong before a hood legend
And grandma died, wipe my eyes, sense a good blessings
Why should I cry? I'm a star living large with fast cars I couldn't be
It was hard being scarred, raised through poverty
I took my chances, never panicked, so a nigga made it
All over-planted, wishes granted now I can't be faded

[Hook: Mr. Bo'z & Kasinova Tha Don]
Get money, money, get it
Get money, money, get it
Get money, money, get it
Get money, yo, get it
Get money, money, get it
Get money, money, get it
Get money, money living the life in the fast lane
All we do is get money all day
Living fast life in the fast lane
Living in the fast lane
Pour 'em cups, put ya hands up
