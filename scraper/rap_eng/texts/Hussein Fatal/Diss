[Verse 1: Hussein Fatal]
Y'all niggas can't fuck with a nigga like me, we pimpin'
Y'all niggas jam in the block, me and my nigga
We get it, don't trip man, game won't slip man
'Zino with the man in the spot, send them niggas to the man
Tell Pac we ridin'
Hardy, Fatal and I am
That nigga on the top, y'all niggas finna get it
Then droppin' the shit don't stop
'Til we copped them bigger guns
And we cocked it and give them some
We droppin' them bigger funds
And they top when' we get 'em done, so, nigga run
And tell 'em how these niggas coming
Y'all niggas are talking about it
Niggas stay' on the strip but the Glock wouldn't be caught without it
Y'all niggas wanna rock 'n' roll that
New truck with them stoppin' goals
Coppin' o's and, nigga, we get it poppin' on the block for sho'
Y'all know what's really good, Young Hardy and Gambino
Fatal to Benzino, when 'Zino the Vin Diesel
That's how we put it down, y'all niggas look around
I know you boke it now, in where we should be now
It's somewhere niggas thuggin', I know that you niggas lovin'
We fuckin' with niggas who get it, got it and wanna touch it

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
Yeah! Uhuh
We got it right now
Back on the East and I'm still in the gators
Waves spittin' like the rims pimpin', yep, and I'm killin' the haters, nigga
And I don't just talk, I walk mines
And if you don't respect nothing else, you gon' respect this chalk line
Lateef, don't talk, stop askin' questions
And this heat don't spark without the match, they stress them
We keep talk Glock to Glock
When you gave the fare to find me out in Vegas right where Pac was shot
With his face on the three-x galaxy-t
Can't be my dawgs but your bitch'll teach you how to be me
Call me Dizzie Dillinger I could teach you how to be free
Got my niggas killing your Glocks and heat you out of you V, bitch
The only thing that stop is your heart
In a millisecond that Hammer gon' hit the nina
Sluggin' poppin it apart
Homie, I started at the top of the chart
And I'm killin' 'em in the whip, shit, imagine if I stop it and park

[Verse 3: Young Hardy]
I give you no time to run
Run up on you point blank then I fire the gun
Little homie don't think, when it gotta get it done
I put work on the corner, broad day in the sun
Too many gunshots, kids can't play where I'm from
All you hear squalay, all day when the cops come
But I'm steady there smashing the fiends
Young Hardy burned blocks like gasoline
Niggas don't play with my quota
Cement feet then I drop 'em in the water
Get handgagged 'til your breath run out
Sixteen shots, you lucky that I left one out
A lot of niggas named they best, but they left one out
And they gon' mention my name from here on out
This young boy spit heroin now, I won't stop
'Til a shotgun punk, start tearin' you out, G
