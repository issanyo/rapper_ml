Verse 1: Fatal

Im Hussein, the Glock cocker, block rocker
Hell of a shot, with the 19 dropper
Smoke the goods, then I choke the hood
Im like a crooked crab cop on the local for good
Murdered my enemies, buried them with the hearters
Dont trust these niggas so I carry a 9 milimeter
In the ??? ballin like never before
Have niggas on ur porch with beretta and fours
Im there trippin off the ???
Reppin Pac, Ill slap u bitchniggaz, I dont care who u with
Cock the sleeve, draw back and cock the e
Think he trippin, you slippin, I got the lead
U ain't gettin a bit of this dough
As a matter of fact gimme that dawg
Payment plan consider it throwed
And I got let you know, 1 more thing from the door
I ain't beefin with the homies, it was never on the low

Hook: Fatal

A gangsta party, we can get it poppin early
Be easy shorty, we can get it poppin early
Now throw ur hands up, lets get it poppin early
And put ur drinks up, lets get it poppin early

Another thong song have ur draws droppin early
We get that brick money, u know we coppin early
A 45. slug will have your heart stoppin early

Verse 2: Fatal

There ain't no nigga like the Don Hussein
And if I could I would do it all again

And if u hating, get in ur line with ur 9 everybody wantin to kill me
Associated in the pressence with thugs

See, Im all about my chips man, watch on my wristband
Droppin that six man, when the Glock switch hands
Im gangsta shorty, we can get it poppin early
Hit the telly, in the mornin we go shoppin early
Only way to get in it, we need a hoe in the circle
