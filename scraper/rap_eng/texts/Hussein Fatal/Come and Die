Feel the helter skelter that even God can't help you
Better run and lie ya ass in shelter
Cos I ain't with the bullshit
Push it in, pull it back then I hit ya with a full clip
And watch ya bleed, you kill my seed
And now I wanna put you on your knees
So look into my eyes
It's time to die (DIE!)

COME AND DIE!
COME AND DIE!
COME AND DIE!
COME AND DIE WITH ME!

[Therapy?'s Andrew James Cairns]
Can't run, can't hide
I will kill you
You can't run, I'm gonna get you
Can't hide, I'm gonna find you
Can't run, I'm gonna kill you
You can't hide, I'm gonna kill you

[Joe Fatal]
Thugs on the wall are goin insane
When I catch this motherfucker I'mma shoot his fuckin brain
Thinkin of a past time rate
Visions of craze that you make for my kid and my wake
Heaven ain't no love for suicide
Sittin in angels' arms punk but you can't run and hide
Bitch there ain't no need to cry
Time's up, it's time to die
