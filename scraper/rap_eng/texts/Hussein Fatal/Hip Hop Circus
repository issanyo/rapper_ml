[Verse:]
This ain’t fatal
Aspects is crackin nigga
[?]
It’s a movement
They got it looking like a circus out there
Look at these clowns
All these funny hats and raps
Lions, bears, scarecrows
Gimmicks acts
Crack straps
[?]
That’ll be jail
Best believe I’ll never go back
Fatskios, snitch niggas Rap CEOs
Cops with Glocks
Peanut brains, pistachios
Trashy hoes
Jump like trapeze artists
Niggas like myself lookin like
Look at these artists
Universal circus
Fulla clowns and cowards
Kissing niggas on lips
Nose opened, drowned in powder
World a girls
Most of em look like thugs
Doing curls and pearls
Sexing when they look like hugs, oh
Tell me now is that or me
Travel in groups
Usually two or three
Louis handbags, lipgloss
Big ass shades
Tight ass jeans lookin like the gay parade
See the awards, call the radio for a ticket
It’s the hip hop circus
Niggas in line to kick it
Hip Hop
Nigga, nigga, nigga
You, you ain't, you ain’t this
Was a circus a clowns [repeat x2]
Too many clowns and bozos with no flow
These homos need to go and train like a mothafuckin dojo
The flow’s cold and the mojo which is so slow
Think they hard but don’t know
They possin like a photo
Crimes got it twisted
These bitches far from vicious
They act suspicious
For instance just check their lyrics
The rap sheet ain’t somethin you write your lyrics on
You think you catchy too
They act suspicious
