(Don't go to sleep)
Nigga this is Death Row, Westside nigga fuck 'em all

[Hook: 2Pac]
Don't go to sleep
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep

[Collision: 2Pac]
Westside nigga
Westside
You know how we do it
California, L.A's finest
Death Row don't fall asleep nigga
Don't fall asleep
Eyes open
Wide open
Quit starin' at me like an infrared nigga

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Pictures of plenty, sippin' my glass full of Henny
Hands on my semi-automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact, 'cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire, niggas die with open eyes
Scared to take a nap, it's a trap, a long maze
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks, makin' scratch the wrong way
What the song say, we murder motherfuckers daily
Blackout, blow the track out, my lyrics never fail me
I inhale strong weed, then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the East to West
Like Yayo
Niggas pull out, when I say so (buck, buck, buck, buck, buck)
Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy me, it's fatal
Efficiently I delete and flee
The art of war livin' sucka free, get with me
Nigga just don't sleep

[Hook: 2Pac & E.D.I]
Don't go to sleep
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't fall asleep
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep

[Verse 2: E.D.I]
Haha
Now in this life I'm leadin' I've tried succeedin' but I fail
I'm thinkin' I should've listened when the teacher was teachin'
I bounced
Through life with mostly knowledge, that a book can give me
But at school, I played the fooled I probably
Should've took it seriously
Now I'm in a position with a mission that's simple
Get some cash in this rap game, a hustle to get through Uh huh
Me and my dawgs, down like we own the force
Fightin' through the war, shoulder to shoulder, Outlawz
Yeah it's just six niggas tatted
At it like addicts, cabbage snatchers
Right on up until they catch us
Forever runnin' from them times that we was broke and
Three dollars for gas and befo' that, then we was walkin'
Haha but peep niggas walk the street
Niggas know the time, so we don't, fall asleep
Come on

[Hook: E.D.I]
Don't fall asleep
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep (Don't go to sleep nigga)
Don't fall asleep
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep (Don't close yo eyes)
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep (Don't go to sleep)
But don't fall asleep

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Sleep baby
Not sleep in the physical form but I mean sleepin' mentally
I mean when niggas close they eyes to the way the game go
You can't fall asleep my nigga
Not on Death Row

[Verse 3: Hussein Fatal]
Mic check, one two, one two, one two
I flip a double deck and stress ya
Snap on this rap
And cut him from his neck to his rectum
Jersey Jigga another nigga from a drug stomach
Fiend for hundreds so if I want it, I'm a thug run it
Robbin' cradles and robbin' niggas for bitches
Robbin' bitches for their riches 'cause I'm straight pullin' switches
Fuck phonics, I cool by the school pumpin' 'notic's
At lunch sharin' a stunt, with a blunt fulla chronic
The Madman, I'm tryna let you know 'bout the badland
So now I'm in your town takin' 'em down to the caravan
Deep like them Jeep as niggas at the greet
So when I creep don't sleep
Or watch your floo' catch a slow leak

[Hook: Kastro]
Don't fall asleep
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't fall asleep
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep

[Outro: 2Pac]
Hahaha!!
Don't go to sleep nigga
Don't go to sleep
Outlawz nigga!
Outlawz!
Mutherfuckin' M.O.B
Money over bitches
Bullets to the tricks
You know what time it is nigga
Don't go to sleep
Bad Boy Killa
There's no one realer
Mobb Deep killa
Chino-X kill..
Hahahahaha
All you niggas die
In your motherfuckin' sleep
Go ahead close your eyes motherfucker
You sleepin' on us
Close your eyes nigga
You sleepin' on the Westside
Go head
Go Fall asleep
Close your eyes
Rock-a-bye-baby
On the tree top
When my Glocks loaded them nigga will drop
Hahahahahaha
Don't fall asleep, nigga
Everybody dies...
