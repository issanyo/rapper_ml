[Intro]
Call 'em up
Call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up
Call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up
Call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em—

[Hook]
Welcome to my world of materialistic motherfuckers
That's how it is when I'm hanging and banging
Welcome to my world, where I be straight stripping motherfuckers
'Cause they be suckers slangin' goods in my hood
Call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up
Call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up
You better call somebody (eh yoooo)
'Cause I'ma fuck around at night and catch me a body

[Verse 1]
Materialistic, mean, cherry red, mystic seat
You heard him floss, but he can't do shit wit' me
You heard of the Outlawz, but motherfucker this is the G
And won't change for a muh'fucker, this is me
Down to the ground and cherish peeps that past before me
I'm still here for the real homies that's askin' for me
No love, but for those that'll blast before me
Don't ask mamma for shit, but please have a casket for me
Hustler without a record deal, your boy still kill them
Gun off safety, gangster 31 like Roy Williams
In the hood, 'cause I wanna be, and when I feel like it's on
I give them the look to put your pussy niggas under me
It's a war goin' on outside, no man is safe from
When you you gotta pay back the same shit you take from

[Hook]
Call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up
Call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up
Welcome to my world of materialistic motherfuckers
That's how it is when I'm hanging and banging
Welcome to my world, where I be straight stripping motherfuckers
'Cause they be suckers, slangin' goods in my hood
Call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up
Call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up
You better call somebody (eh yoooo)
'Cause I'ma fuck around at night and catch me a body

[Verse 2]
I floss like a boss supposed to, and it musta
Been something he did that make him ever cross or choke you
I'm hood, without this rap shit, homie I'm hood
I ain't bragging 'bout my thug life, fuck it I'm good
The killers feel me and they don't kill me, mane I hustle
One man hit team, Ali Bang for muscle
What do we have hear now? Nope
Not 2Pac, another thug nigga, brazin'
Similar style, Hard Life Entertainment in life
To a white mans world when you get played wit' your life
Won't front I'm a rap nigga, but the dangerous type
And how I'm livin' I ain't sayin' it's right, but I'm the real hood
I bang and floss on these niggas 'cause it feels good
And if the jealous ain't kill them, then the pills would
These niggas know they know what I'm known for
But they won't think it's real 'til I'm standing in their grill wit' a chrome 4

[Hook]
Welcome to my world of materialistic motherfuckers
That's how it is when I'm hanging and banging
Welcome to my world where I be straight stripping motherfuckers
'Cause they be suckers, slangin' goods in my hood
Call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up
Call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up, call 'em up
You better call somebody
'Cause I'ma fuck around at night and catch me a body

[Outro]
Call your homeboys up
You better get on that Boost Mobile nigga
And you hope you do—
You better hope that you didn't run out of minutes
I'm telling you that now, 'cause I ain't running outta shots
Big Q, yeah
Hard Life Entertainment
Y'all know what it is, Hussein Fatal, Jersey stand up - Right!
I'ma fuck around at night and catch me a body
