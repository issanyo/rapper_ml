[Hook]
My game is tight, my money is long
My cars is new, my muscle is strong
My crack, my nine, my dope is a ten
5 o'clock in the morning, we open again
My game is tight, my money is long
My cars is new, my muscle is strong
My crack, my nine, my dope is a ten
5 o'clock in the morning, we open again

[Verse 1]
I do what I want in the hood they seem to just loves me
Fuck the law middle finger to cops in public
I'm rippin' the streets, but I rather be rippin' the stage
I'm from the zoo and my gorillas don't fit in no cage
We go bananas for the hood, and go ape for the baby
And I'm married all the time, no mistake it for lady
If everything is all for hundred, I'm takin' the eighty
And all these misdemeanor 2's, is makin' me crazy
I get it for this, and sell it for that
I walk wit' the fifth, I ride wit the MAC
My crack, my nine, my dope is a ten
5 o'clock in the morning we open again
It's never 'bout nothing unless it's involving some caper
And if I can't sell you nothing, I'll talk to you later
Do what I gotta do, the coppers can't stop me I mean
I dirty the 40 and dropped it, then cop me the [?]

[Hook]
My game is tight, my money is long
My cars is new, my muscle is strong
My crack, my nine, my dope is a ten
5 o'clock in the morning, we open again
My game is tight, my money is long
My cars is new, my muscle is strong
My crack, my nine, my dope is a ten
5 o'clock in the morning, we open again

[Verse 2]
You niggas just pussy you laming and show through your hustle
Go ahead and act like you won't it, watch me run through your muscle
I know I'm 'bout it 'bout it
I love to stash money
You see that bitch right there she keeps it in her ass for me
I'm always on point
At night I might sleep wit' the hammer
The mail man I drop it off and I creep wit' the scanner
I'm untouchable but shit I ain't Al Capone
We twist up sour, and that kush leave the malls alone
The coppers behind me, but fuck it I speed wit' no license
The chopper hold 90, so blood ain't no need for fightin'
My crack, my nine, my dope is a ten
5 o'clock in the morning we open again
Get caught cutting shorts we gon' open your skin
I had a 44 long nose poked in your chin
My game is tight my money is long
I get money from the hood and get money from songs

[Hook]
My game is tight, my money is long
My cars is new, my muscle is strong
My crack, my nine, my dope is a ten
5 o'clock in the morning, we open again
My game is tight, my money is long
My cars is new, my muscle is strong
My crack, my nine, my dope is a ten
5 o'clock in the morning, we open again
My game is tight, my money is long
My cars is new, my muscle is strong
My crack, my nine, my dope is a ten
5 o'clock in the morning, we open again
My game is tight, my money is long
My cars is new, my muscle is strong
My crack, my nine, my dope is a ten
5 o'clock in the morning, we open again

[Outro]
Yeah, big don if you already know
Tight game, game tight than a motherfucker
Money longer than your [?]
You know, big game big fight
Niggas eve'ywhere spending all of kinds of money
In and out of everybody hotel
Could seeing hoes and doing all of that

The one thing for sure, are we on all that?
What's that? Somebody opened it up
