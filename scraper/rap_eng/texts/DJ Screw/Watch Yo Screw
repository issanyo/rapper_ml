[Intro: E.S.G.]

Keep yo' eyes on yo' motherfuckin' Screw, know what I'm tal' 'bout?
We down here jammin', but uhh, I don't give a fuck who it is...
It could be your homeboy, your bitch, your main-gal
Your sister, your mama, your grandma: Everybody stealin' Screw! So watch yo Screw, know what I'm sayin'?
So when a nigga get into your motherfuckin' car tal' 'bout
"Uh, where the light at?"
You go and lookin' back and shit.. watch yo' Screw!
Know wha' I'm sayin'? Cause niggas want 'em
You could leave: two sticks, a swisher, and a fo'
And a Screw tape on the counter
And ain't nobody taking none of those drugs..
The fo' will still be ther', the sticks will be ther'
Know wha' I'm sayin'? The swisher be ther'
But where's the motherfuckin' Screw?
Everybody want Screw
So when you get this Screw right her'
I want you to hold on to this motherfucke'
Cause we gon' come up in '94, you best believe that
This just ain't no in-the-house-flowing-Screw-thang
Me and Screw trying to expand this shit, 'naw what I'm sayin'
We just left Jack the Rapper, 'naw what I'm tal' bout
We trying to let everyb- the world how we do it down South..
So keep your hands on your Screw
Oh, and keep your eyes on the motherfuckin' law, and the motherfuckin' jackas
And this for all the bitch-smackas and the pistol-packas
And we out..

[Outro: E.S.G.]
Don't say E.S.G didn't warn ya.....
