[DJ Screw: "It's Goin' Down"]

[Chorus - Chamillionaire] (DJ Screw)
Last night I had a dream, the north and south had no mo' plex
And Houston was the place to be
(It's Goin' Down), standin' taller then the rest
A dream and memory (It's Goin' Down), of DJ Screw gotta show respect
So put ya lighters in the sky with me
(It's Goin' Down), R.I.P. this is what was said

[Verse]
I had a dream I said, "about who", the god said
Dirty south went nationwide cuz of DJ Screw, I said
"Is that true"?, the god said, yeah it's true I get
To do flows, and wreck show cuz of DJ Screw I'm fed
But don't be mislead, you the reason we get bread
Please tell him when I get to heaven, it's gon' be respect
He the reason we get checks, ain't gotta be in debt
Ya music helped alot of southern families to get fed
They won't say what I just said (why?), cuz some of these guys scared (oh)
Just tryin' to acknowledge and put it in these guys heads
I see, I said, "then deed", god said
That he glad that the north and southside E.O.E X'd it
I agree, I said, R.I.P., I said
Rest In Peace to the legend Screw and P.A.T. I said
Swear I still jam ya music, I won't let no one abuse it
Can't do it, another's foolish if he think that he the truest
Cuz you was the first to screw it, you rule it but I'ma student
I'm new at the stuff ya started, but I'll do it until I'm through it
Life after I loose it, go have a talk with the streets
And they gon' tell ya that I respected the game, Rest In Peace

[Chorus - Chamillionaire] (DJ Screw)
Last night I had a dream, the north and south had no mo' plex
And Houston was the place to be
(It's Goin' Down), standin' taller then the rest
A dream and memory (It's Goin' Down), of DJ Screw gotta show respect
So put ya lighters in the sky with me
(It's Goin' Down), R.I.P. this is what was said

[DJ Screw Insert]
DJ Screw, slow ish down
Puttin' in work all over H-Town
See me on the scene
Drankin' codeine
Gat up on my lap
Puttin' haters on my beam
