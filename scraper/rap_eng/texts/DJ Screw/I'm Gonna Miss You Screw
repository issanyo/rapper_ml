[Hook: Miss Asiah]
I'm gonna miss you Screw
I'm gonna miss you Screw
I'm gonna miss you Screw
And it's coming from that Big Tyme crew

[Ronnie Spencer]
Hey fellas yeah, I don't know what I'm gonna do
Now I can't live my life, without you Screw
And everytime, I'm flipping down the Avenue
I see that bubble gum Impala, coming through
And I know, it's DJ Screw
Even though you made it, you made it
You always kept it real

[Hook]

[Ronnie Spencer]
It was bad enough, when someone stole my Screw tape
Oh I was devastated
What I'm trying to say, what I'm trying to say
Oh you really will be missed, until I see you again one day
Until I see you Screw
Even though, you made it
You always kept it real, keep it real Screw

[Hook - 3x]

(Ronnie Spencer)

And everybody, everybody gon' miss you baby
Yeah yeah
