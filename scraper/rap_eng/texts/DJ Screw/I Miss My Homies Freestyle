[Verse 1: Mike D]
How the fuck they gon' try to play me like a ho
Knowing damn well I'm a young nigga on my papo
Better raise the fuck above my goddamn nuts
Cause I slang 81 yola nuts
And you know I fucking hang on the cuts
Where the paper stacks increase
You can catch me on the street
I'm smoking sweets and in my pants I got a crest
Cause these boys really can't see a G from before
Smokin' sticks sippin' barre
In my [?]
That's the Screw to the union they right behind me
And he gon' wreck this damn thang about the SU to the C

[Verse 2: DJ Screw]
Screwed Up Click
You better think twice
Deep in this game these niggas living shife
Only try to take a G under the table
But a nigga sittin' high, stackin' that paper
Everyday I cough of blunts and parlay
Southside everyday do my way
Before action steady taxin'
These hoes be jealous cause a nigga coming through
They tryna prevail us

[Verse 3: Mike D]
Know they can't do me and Screw
You gon' put it down like we fucking ruling
Hidin' niggas wanna hang with me
And if my game you better back da fuck up off me
