[Verse 1]
Might buy a Gucci Bag
All my emotional baggage
Might get attached to me baby
Please don't start no bad habits
Traffic in a 2-door coupe
It’s a blue, TL Acura
You flip sides like a spatula
Fuck the words, I need action
Cause I got big dreams
Small dollars, Big problems
Rockstar jeans, burn holes
My pockets, road-runnin'
New dollars, all profit
Back up off me
Young nigga, I'm still wildin’
I'm in the city still
Yeah
Deals at ALL-DEF got me Digital
That's off The Ritual
I'm not wit subliminals
Nah
I'm not pulling up in a rental
What's a friend zone to potential?
1 time is fine, I'm dismissive
Then I get high, might forget ya
Demons from 2011
And I can't forget ’em
I had to make a decision
Heaven & Hell coexisting
I can relate to the misfits
Used to cop packs off of Sunset
She must not know I’m the 1 yet
Atlanta show love like I'm from there
I risked it all for the Sunsphere
You niggas hating ain’t done yet
Used steal Jay's from the Outlets
And then hit the Dillard's for outfits
Yeah
What would I do if I left shit to you?
Got too much to lose
Night shifts replacing the snooze

[Hook]
2much for these niggas
3much for these hoes (3x)
I just chase the money
That's just how it goes

2much for these niggas
3much for these hoes (3x)
I just chase the money
That’s just how its gone go

[OUTRO]
Oh yes, I love her like
Pussy, money weed
Pussy, money weed
Pussy, money weed (4x)
