Listen for a minute
Now let me get it
Have you ever stopped to think?
That they put it in ink
That you need to see a shrink
Because they value traits that make you easier to control
The truth is cold, so I take the world and I chop it and screw it
Cause that's how I get through it
And everything is so thick, that my brother I might be sick
So pass me the weed..so I may proceed to give these people what they need
I lead, but never follow
And nah bitch, my head ain't hollow
I keep a lot of info in my dome
But you all say the same thing like a homophone and I'm comin through to break ya bones
With sticks and stones
I came to roam
Around the astral plane
My spirit you can't contain with this hollow shell of a body
I hit you like a shotty
Across the chest
Cause you know my lyrical styles you cannot contest
I kick it from the east all the way down to the west
I have no coast, I am the innermost part of the country
I feel like gumby, cause I'm stretchy and leanin' and im fiendin' for some mo
So po' it up
Not in the cup
Because I never use one for that shit
I just chug it
And then I take my motherfuckin' stomach and hug it
I wait and hour then oh shit
Im trippin
Dont think you'll ever stop my sippin
Ballin like scottie pippen
Rippin up tracks and chillin to the max
Just relax and let ya mind float
This is the antidote
This ain't no motherfuckin' anecdote
You better grab the rope
Because you have no hope of bein' quite like me
The freshest of mc's
Every single one of you mother fuckers by now should know my steez
Im doin it with ease
Never for the cheese
Just give me a motherfuckin' handshake please
And tell me you like to hear what I gotta say
I filet mc like bobby flay
I'm doin it every day
And you know where to find me
Haha
The address where I be
Is 16 17 grand highlands drive
I'm stayin alive
Like the bee gees
Y'all bitches is gettin' a freebie
So I'll see thee later alligator
But for now stop and ask your self how did he do that
I'm comin with nothin but the boom bap
This is true rap
I don't need to stack the cream
I'll smash your dreams
Cause boa
Reality ain't really what it seems
So I tear it apart at the seams
And hit you with light beams of truth
I'm bringin the fuckin family together they call a brother
Michael bluth
Hittin' homeruns like babe ruth
Atta boy
Now you makin noise
You gotta have poise and charisma
Its a miracle that I haven't passed out from rappin so fast and I'm still whoopin that ass
