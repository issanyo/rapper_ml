[Intro]
Nah I’m saying
What’s the motherfucking deal
DJ Screw on this motherfucker nah I'm saying
They gonna start this load up shit

[Verse 1]
Oh yea, so yea to another forty eight nigga
Street king can’t shit the cloud
Pulling up with the slob top reclining
Screwed up Texas like it's time you find them
Like the 4th of july t fly I blind them
Would working diamonds get some shining haters
In them feelings get them rewinding
Bitches after bitches I don’t mind them
Suicide the way they big I dime them
Trade the true but instead they have me flexing
I don’t give a fuck for your descressions
Say they mind bitch that ain’t no question
Top is up the bumper keep the risk up
Drapers will be damned I played jackers
Go to trips and bitched go to take you
Murder seen they still be up and pack you
Top that goes whacking and lumberjack you

[Hook]
Walls can’t break you
And the fall like data
Switch from the creating
Now I will break up the equator
Carbon walls can’t scrape her
And the fall like data
Switch from the creating
Now I will break up the equator
Carbon walls can’t scrape her
And the fall like data
Switch from the creating
Now I will break up the equator
Carbon walls can’t scrape her
And the fall like data
Switch from the creating
Now I will break up the equator

[Verse 2]
Hold up swingers now got me tipping
Now the world watching me everytime that I roll
This one is on my line I guess there is someone
Leaning from this shit we bold up
Don’t you get it twisted and in any given time
I hear them they gonna be load up
They be in for life and I bet we never be fold up
Domestic violence and now the trunk is beaten
Bitches opposite then when I roll I see no bitches
About the money when I eat I feel no bitches
All I do is duck a roaches see the rich money
Money how this money coming and I just shake
The block like every tropless homie yea this shit
The beauty talking grid and got me chasing make
Me feel like i’m running on the corner got it locked
Cause I ain’t gonna do shit like boss gotta bang
If you throw away bullets with no name on them
Then I hop back in the slab and I swing on them
Paint it in the hood let it rain on em hard cop to a
Coup make it change on them bread long got me
Through the range on them new case throwback
Looking strange on them

[Hook]
Walls can’t break you
And the fall like data
Switch from the creating
Now I will break up the equator
