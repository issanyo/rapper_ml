[Hook: ЯhÅPΣΩÐ™]
Betchya Sody won't slip
Best approaches to the beat, lil boy you can see, I commit
Then retreat, from deceit, won't submit
2018, April's Finest is the recipe, til the death of me

[Bridge: EmLB3 & ЯhÅPΣΩÐ™]
Til the death of me, you will see
We'll be the best to be
With God, the blessing tree
I talk to him, so trustingly
And odd, cause I agree
That, I wanna be
Apart of the
Rose City's key
On a gritty spree
To the max degree

[Verse 1: ЯhÅPΣΩÐ™]
When we stepup to the scene; no recognition
But Niggas know the music, so now they down to listen
To the message of conditions, and what in the city's missin
On a city mission, to transition my position
All I need is one audition, I'll be the next addition
Way past to ignition, no 7 speed whippin
Transmission, would be rippin
& paint would just glisten
Bitches trippin, at the lot, caught
Strippin, on the spot, for a shot

"Ay, you on the way?"
"Where you at?"
"Ight, cool. I'm comin down oulette. Just, just check me at 7/11, I'ma pick up a Slurpee real quick"
"Yeah, Huh?"
"Yeah, yeah, I got it"
"Ight, Easy"

[Verse 2: ЯhÅPΣΩÐ™]
Back up at the scene, burnin green, rhymin clean
I'm a rapfiend, because it's in my gene, only 18
Feelin 38
Critics wanna hate
Cause they don't relate
Ready for my fate
Steady til the date
