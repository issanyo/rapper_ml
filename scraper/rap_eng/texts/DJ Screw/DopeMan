The battle is mine
The rattle was mine
So that be the reason
We fight all the time
No matter what I gotta
Stay on my grind
Added you on to the roster
You fine
You gotta bill
To be staying in line I be looking for watches
Like look at the time
Remember the time
That was one for your mind
If I am the second I'm coming with fire
The 3rd he been here like I cannot expire
Words of my sounds
Just to meet common ground
Look at my son, there’s no stopping us now
Bitches always on my joc going down

Last call for drinks
But it's not alcohol
What was you thinkin?
I don't drink at all (huh?)

10 of us who say I’m the one?
I'm still proud of you've become
In my car I think I'm a bum
Need my chick like who on the run (II)

This is not lean
This is not alcohol
What was I thinkin
I might need it after all (Water)

10 of us who came after 1
I'm not proud of who I've become
In my whip I think ima bum
I might get addicted to rum
Can I put that right there on yo tongue
Nah I'm playing bitch I'm not done

They say I made it
I’m getting paid but I am not saving
There is no way that I am a burden
My nigga you made me (who)
All of my kids is already grown
Nigga I’m baby
White coat mashed potatoes inside gravy
Huh

Flippity floop need a pippity poop
Or else ima have to keep shitting on you
Glittery gloop on a slippery stoop
Symbolizes how I'm spitting on you

Then we fire up
Huh
I’m the one who hot I'm the sun
I got two who love to have fun
Okay on three I'm bet that we won
Just for four, they got em a nun
Level 5 my conscious is on
Number 6 like how did you come?
7 still in heaven for one
8 I keep some kush in my lungs
9 prolly when I get done
10?
