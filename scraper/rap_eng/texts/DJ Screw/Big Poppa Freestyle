[Big Steve]
Well it's me the S-T-E-V
E, Big Steve got a trick up my sleeve
The one who come down in the night
Nigga caught them hoes slipping in the day light
Hittin' that motherfucking M-L what say K
Nigga 'round the corner had the hook up with that bay
Here some more sherm, you know it's my turn
A nigga wants to know [?] make them hoes jerm
Get some more ice for the motherfucking drank
Got my Glock ready to put to his head, take his bank
Nigga took the stash, nigga took a whole key
Full of that fucking killer, yeah it's me
The one in the motherfucking [?] what side
I took [?]
Nigga went to the fucking hell
You know my pockets swell, if I get locked [?] pay bail
Cause I know they down with fucking with me
And everybody nigga,  all the hoods yeah you see
Down with the niggas from the motherfucking circle
Came down with them niggas that come down candy purple
Nigga gotta come red wine like that [?]
