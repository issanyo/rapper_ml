[Intro: DJ Paul talking]
It's on now, you know a lot of folks ask me why
I call myself the king of Memphis
Basically cause niggas studying us you know, what I'm saying
A lot of shit that we doing niggas
Want to do you know, what I'm saying
We brought the first platinum and gold plaques to the city
We representing the city
We did the first movie you know
What I'm saying holding it down
Now all of a sudden everybody want
To be a hypnotize minds or hypnotize camp posse
You know niggas want to dis me and talk shit
I show half of these niggas to stay on beat
You know what I'm talking 'bout
But it's cool though we can play if you want to play

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
I'm a snitch nigga killa 3rd ward gun spitter
Been loadin' triggers with them hydro shots nigga
I'm the man been the man since before you
(Yean know)
Rocking shows fuckings hoes waiting for you
(Yean know)
Riding clean cut green maine before you
(Yean know)
My own crib, money in bank before you
And I'm a pro with a 4-5
Try to test me bitch don't try to make me out a fucking lie
I never go against the fucking grain
But if you cross me first I got to show
You, I'm a fucking mayn
I had some niggas in my clique that I'm glad they gone
And it's some niggas in my clique that I hate they gone
Cause right here it's 'bout that business not that bullshit
If you winning 'bout that business get the fuck trick
Before I buck trick you better duck trick
Or get ran over by them black fucking trucks bitch

[Hook]
Don't pull yo gun unless you gonna use it

Back da fuck back, nigga, back da fuck back
Back da fuck back, nigga, back da fuck back
Back da fuck back, nigga, back da fuck back

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Sir Lord, your highness, majesty, king
Hitin' stupid niggas with the boom-ping-ping
Cuttin' down a hoe with the sling blade sling
Tape the mouth up so they don't hear you scream
A butcher knife won't leave a big enough scar
I'ma leave yo ass with a shark-bite mark
Rip off yo sleeve leave off the brakes on you bitch
Trick ass pigeon you motherfucking snitch
Then I take yo guts and I drill 'em spill 'em
For these kind of burns you can't use penicillin
A boy is harder than 4 large chili
Oh, nigga I would love to beat yo ass silly
Execute while you beggin' down on your kn-izz-ees
Take you to the morgue and I'll put yo in the fr-izz-eeze
My favorite hobby is hiding niggas bodies
A real killa like to work clean not sloppy
