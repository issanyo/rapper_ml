[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Ballin' through my hood, ain't you clean fool
Show love finna get stuck up
Tell that bitch ain't my thing, sweet black sugar fuckin' stang
Laid back, Glock tight, full of that Tanqueray
When I scope I hope a nigga drop off that cheese
I don't wanna hurt nobody unless I gotta click for them keys
Mane, let's stick up these h-izz-oe in the h-izz-oe sp-izz-ot
G-I-M-I Sum (?)
Pistol grip, pistol whip, don't you trip without yo clip my nig
If you ain't kinfolk, Deuce double one is what me do
Biddy bop me Glock pop on yo chest
Unless you brought yo bulletproof
I'm jealous, fellas roll too clean
I gotta get mine so I'mma take yours
Spank me with somethin' (?) fuck that, just gonna kick it on in
Don't you shout, don't you make no noise
I'm down to die for mine all the time
Lay yo bitch ass down clown, seventeen rounds
I can shoot at yo face, I won't miss, turn on this
Infrared got you scared, Pappa Paul pluggin' heads
Jack be nimble, get jacked so quick
Jack with a Jason mask on that bitch
Terrifyin' these niggas soul, 666 we like that shit
Biatch
