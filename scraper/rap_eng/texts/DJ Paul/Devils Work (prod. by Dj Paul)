[V.I]
Baby where we're going tonight
G wag 550 cocaine white
Black nails wrap the Xd 9
I always keep my baby on my mind
Baby when your not around
That's when I start breaking down
Load a bullet in the clip
For every hour not around
Baby when you coming back?
When you do I got the sack
I'll be waiting in my room
Dropping ashes after ash
With my bitch in the whip
Cut my wrist then I watch it drip
Fall and pray to the triple 6
I can't work gotta chase that flip
Wrap the Zigs on that yurple sip
Looking to catch me a lick
Just for the green gotta put them in ditch
Killing and leaving me no witnesses
You won't exist when the clip
Bullet exit and hits through your flesh
Leave you gasping for breath yeah just like it's suppose'ta
You looking for death well guess what
You gonna meet her soon as she pop out the hol-ster
It bang your brains hang your blood drain
Bitch you can't hang I'm deranged insane
Baby told me kill if they get in way
