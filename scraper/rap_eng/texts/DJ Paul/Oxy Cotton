[Verse 1: Lil' Wyte]
Go on and slip me two Xanax Bars - I'm ready to get full
5th of Crown to wash it down, I'm downtown snapping rolls
Ain't no shame up in my game - in fact I'm mentally deranged
Oxycontin in my system - man I'm feeling kinda strange
Watch me choke about this dope - Blueberry from Texas
You wanna git up in rotation that's too bad cause I'm stressing
By now its 1:30 am - 11 Percocets just entered me
15 minutes from this second - I'll be crawling on my knees
Laughing at the crowd of all the clowns that be surrounding me
Take another Lortab to calm me down and let me see
Body be relaxed - muscles be loose, and you have stopped the pain
No more bitching 'bout your day and work and driving in the rain
Put up wit' the fussing and discussion - I plant in your brain
Hypnotize ya minds, like all the rest but I come through the veins
Take a chill pill to slow me down and git back in this game
Gotta be up on ya P's and Q's to even feel it mane

[Hook: Lil' Wyte]
Oxycontin, Xanax Bars, Percocet, and Lortab
Valiums, Morphine, patches, Exctacy, and it's all up for grab
What'cha want, what'cha need, hit me up I got you mane
What'cha want, what'cha need, hit me up I got you mane
Oxycontin, Xanax Bars, Percocet, and Lortab
Valiums, Morphine, patches, Exctacy, and it's all up for grab
What'cha want, what'cha need, hit me up I got you mane
What'cha want, what'cha need, hit me up I got you mane

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Scarecrow, scarecrow whats that you popping?
A powerful pill they call Oxycontin
But it's so tiny, that it catch you dragging
Haven't you heard big things come in small packages
I prefer the orange's with the black O-C
Take two and you cannot move up out your seat
Some people melt em' down in a needle and shoot 'em up
But I pop 'em with Seroquel like glue, I am stuck

[Verse 3: Crunchy Black]
See I'm a pill popper - so I'mma keep poppin' em
Gimme 20 Xanax and I'mma start droppin' em
There ain't no stoppin' 'em - when they in my system
Mane I really miss 'em - can you help me get some
I heard you have Clidina, on that fucking pill shit
Gimme some fuckin Ec' - gimme some Percocets
I need me some four bar, so I can break down
Cause a nigga like me 'finna take it to funky town
