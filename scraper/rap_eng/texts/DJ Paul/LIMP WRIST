[Intro: Child's Play 2]
Close your eyes and count to seven, when you wake you'll be in heaven...

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Jack be nimble, get jacked so quick
Jack with a Jason mask on that bitch
Terrifyin' these nigga's souls
666, we like that shit, see?
Jack be nimble, get jacked so quick
Jack with a Jason mask on that bitch
Terrifyin' these nigga's souls
666, we like that shit, see?
Jack be nimble, get jacked so quick
Jack with a Jason mask on that bitch
Terrifyin' these nigga's souls
666, we like that shit, see?

[Verse 1: $WITCHBLADE $CRIM]
666 we like that shit
Roll that bud, and light that spliff
Cock it back one time, I bust
Fuck all these bitches, no hoes I trust
Bitch, I got that devil in me
Murderous, I like them semi's
Heard of us? We smoke like chimneys
Sipping codeine, ain't got no kidneys
Running this shit with some blood on my feet
$uicide bitch, ain't no hoe up in me
Step on my scene, I'ma put you to sleep
They treat me like Jesus, they bow down to me
It's that phonky flowing, mystic blowing
Junkie, selling, robbing, killing
Bodies stacking to the fucking ceiling
Weapon on me, ain't no concealing

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Jack be nimble, get jacked so quick
Jack with a Jason mask on that bitch
Terrifyin' these nigga's souls
666, we like that shit, see?
Jack be nimble, get jacked so quick
Jack with a Jason mask on that bitch
Terrifyin' these nigga's souls
666, we like that shit, see?
Jack be nimble, get jacked so quick
Jack with a Jason mask on that bitch
Terrifyin' these nigga's souls
666, we like thatâ€”

[Verse 2: YUNG PLAGUE]
Pulling a name out the flame
Call me Yung Plague
Slitting my wrist with a blade
I'm insane
Murder my style
You don't like it?
Too bad because I'm killing myself anyway
Got that rope around my neck, now I'm ready to hang
Keep on holding that TEC
I'm that target to spray
Got an ocean of roaches and locusts approaching
I'm hoping they don't think I'm Moses
I'm sending them all to their graves

[Outro: YUNG PLAGUE]
Slitting 666 in my limp wrist, bitch
Slitting 666 in my limp wrist, bitch
Slitting 666 in my limp wrist, bitch
Slitting 666 in my limp wrist, bitch
