[Intro]
*doorbell* Yea? *bang* Surprise nigga!

[Verse 1: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Time for me to act like a psychopathic lunatic
Some people don't believe that I can get ignorant
Ignorant, it's just a simple way of being fucked up
Fuck niggas for a bunch of dough like a drug bust
Bustas with no nuts wanna give me shit real quick
Quit beggin' trick 'fore I shoot you in yo face bitch
Bitch ass niggas like to high cap like they from the hood
Hood pimpin' niggas like to shoot them pistols with no love
Lovelessly you get this, when I smoke a bitch
Stand over him, open my pants, pour, then take a piss
P-izzn-iss on his f-izzn-ames
Bitch I thought you kn-izz-ew th-izz-at I'mma cl-izz-ick
Since on my business only hoes play
Found on a nigga that's givin' the money
The money the bitches receivin'
Receivin' ... hoe be like comin' up short
Now she wanna call the folks
Folks better known as 5-0, we like to shoot them thangs
Reach up in the bushes bitch, cause I ain't tryin' to change

[Hook]
Ship ahoy!

[Verse 2: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Nigga, nigga want a ass whoopin' from a nutcase
Murder cases what I apprehend, you don't understand
"Stand around ... with some cries
Hangin' out the window, leave you stankin' on the flies"
Stanky ass projects, real niggas dwell at
Niggas killin' junkies cause they runnin' off with our crack
Crack in a test tube, shakin' up a fat piece
Peace to my niggas on (?) it to the street
Streets for the niggas ain't takin' shit for Gimisum
Half ... in hell, half of them niggas still in jail
Jail ain't shit but a place to make another plan
How to rob this to get my motherfuckin' ass in
... bloody barrel on the Glock
Glocks make a trick won't stop till I get the shit
Shit (?) mane I love to make a stang
Keep the dough and fuck off (?) I ain't change

[Hook]
Ship ahoy!

[Outro, repeating]
Time for me to act like a psychopathic lunatic
