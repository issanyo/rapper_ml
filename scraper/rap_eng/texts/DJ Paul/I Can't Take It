[Intro]
I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired
What the fuck’s going on all this bullshit around here man?
Y’all fucking the game up, been fucking it up for years
I don’t care what you do, do what you do
But for all my niggas that want that real shit
Here you go, I’m fucking fed up with that all shit nigga
I’m fed up!

[Hook]
I can’t take it no fucking more, no fucking more
Pussy shit, no fucking more, no fucking more
Pussy nigga, no fucking more, no fucking more
Pussy shit, no fucking more, no fucking more
I bring them g’s back in this hoe, back in this hoe
I bring them killers, back in this hoe, back in this hoe
I bring them g’s back in this hoe, back in this hoe
Pussy niggas grinding for the dough, grinding for the dough

[Verse 1]
I said I’m done defending rap, every of these niggas can’t even rap
Every these niggas done killed the game so bad, I just went back to trap
And I ain’t doing no features, for you motherfucking leeches
Where the fuck was your parents, who the fuck is your teacher?
Who the hell is your preacher, cause you niggas is sitting shame
I used to love rap, but thanks to you shit ain’t the same
Who want the rasters, fucking beast me
If y’all niggas hard, the the fuck that makes me
All these dealers faking, I’m just wondering how they made it
If you think that shit is quaking, you think it’s hallucinating
These rappers so overrated, I’m the cold go 18
Greatest of our times nigga, god has made me for it

[Hook]
I can’t take it no fucking more, no fucking more
Pussy shit, no fucking more, no fucking more
Pussy nigga, no fucking more, no fucking more
Pussy shit, no fucking more, no fucking more
I bring them g’s back in this hoe, back in this hoe
I bring them killers, back in this hoe, back in this hoe
I bring them g’s back in this hoe, back in this hoe
Pussy niggas grinding for the dough, grinding for the dough

[Verse 2]
They don't like me, I talk shit
Yellow looking me like no, he didn't
Bubble go around [?] that bullshit is over [?]
We fake rappers don't stand behind
Straight pussy look at the signs
Listen to your record, uh, I gotta go, look at the time
Bust the niggas, I'm gonna bust tonight
All they're doing is gonna bust some rhymes
We can. and we can rhyme
Half of the time, then we can lie
These niggas some [?] they're from the streets
Maybe they need a gangsta kid
I know what it is [?] no gangsta shit
So why my real G rap sound like R&B
[?] the new CDs get spreading like [?]
The way I see it is fake versus realer
Pussy try me, these niggas gonna pour that liquor

[Hook]
I can’t take it no fucking more, no fucking more
Pussy shit, no fucking more, no fucking more
Pussy nigga, no fucking more, no fucking more
Pussy shit, no fucking more, no fucking more
I bring them g’s back in this hoe, back in this hoe
I bring them killers, back in this hoe, back in this hoe
I bring them g’s back in this hoe, back in this hoe
Pussy niggas grinding for the dough, grinding for the dough
