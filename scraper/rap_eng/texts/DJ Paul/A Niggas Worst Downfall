(DJ Paul)
A bitch can be a nigga's worst downfall
A bitch can be a nigga's worst downfall
A bitch can be a nigga's worst downfall

(DJ Paul)
Man, I'll shoot a bitch in the face if she try to f**k with me
Or try to tell lies and shit and turn me against my f**kin peeps

A hoe will tell a nigga this, a hoe will tell a nigga that
A hoe will tell a nigga anything to try and get back

Had another nigga who she hollin that he down wit
Make them nigga's grab nine's, make them nigga's cry and shit
Alot of yall stupid ass nigga's, fall for these hoes
Suck the dick and f**kin stuck you now anything goes
Sluggin luchi out, pay no bill's so you ain't mine
A million hoes on my side, two million can't stand
You dealin wit a nigga who like to grab hoes and choke
Two days ago, i'm in trail found out Ms. Pu was no joke
Alot of ladies want to be the mother, they need's to quit
I'm strappin trojans god, I ain't tryin to land shit
But back to weak friends, who let hoes turn them against me cool
When I kill you, I'm killin dat hoe to
And dat's fa sho

Chorus
A bitch can be a nigga's worst downfall
(Make you hate the very day you even touched the draws)
A bitch can be a nigga's worst downfall
(Saw a playa nigga ridin close against the stalls)
A bitch can be a nigga's worst downfall
(I bet you had to get crossed up wit the laws)
A bitch can be a nigga's worst downfall
(F**k all these bitches, f**k all yall)

(Lord Infamous)
These bitches are ridiculous, they fakin images and form
Hell has no fury like a motherf**kin woman scorn
They poppin corn, nightly long, flossin wit the carnege on
All the f**kin time she tryin get up into your pockets more
No housin us, slap the tramp, hit her wit the sonyia
Tell the bitch she better bail, lock her out your f**kin house
Cause man a hoe will screw ya, she'll try to have your junior
To take all your loot-uh so slap her wit da ruger
Man I tell these bitches that work for damn
And all this love is just a scam
Keyser Soze f**k you baby lady baby miss f**k you ma'am
Just because we f**k ya pooty tang
Dont mean your worth some change
Bitch you ain't needy, you just conseeded
So stay up out of our faces mayne
You ain't gettin a f**kin thang
Clean your f**kin tweedy, and stop being greedy
Bitches tryin to knock, knock, knocky on your jock
Tryin to get a style f**kin piece of your rock

Chorus
A bitch can be a nigga's worst downfall
(Make you hate the very day you even touched the draws)
A bitch can be a nigga's worst downfall
(Saw a playa nigga ridin close against the stalls)
A bitch can be a nigga's worst downfall
(I bet you had to get crossed up wit the laws)
A bitch can be a nigga's worst downfall
(F**k all these bitches, f**k all yall)

(Juicy J)
They heard the album had went gold my phone
Ringin up my hoes, said they heard I bought a house
Through the streets someone had told
Bout a little f**kin bitch, playin scams to make it rich
Evey night after we f**k, I used to beat her with my fist
Drag a hoe down on the ground, like a nigga trained a hound
Till she said she was pressin charges
(I'ma see you downtown nigga)
Oh shit, what can I do to the one wit boys and blue
If a nigga got to jail that's gonaa set back my loot
Should I call up the fool, that be creepin in the river
Make a litter I'm doing dirt, he'll erase you out like poof
If the cheese a playa drop, he goin to pull his tone and cock
When I tell him where you live he goin ride through and pop
