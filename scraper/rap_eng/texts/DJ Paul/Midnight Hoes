[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I never seen a ho that could make a cheese flow
Until I moved to Texas where the shake junts ain't broke
When I fell up off the plane the only thing stuck in my mind
I know I'm fucked up but shit I gotta get on mine
So now I gotta sell a little pussy ho to stain
Nation wide cd's and hoes I'm the mane
Most of my niggas they ridin' clean
Chieffing a quarter pound of skunk
Broke rappers on the shelf while I be slanging out the trunk
I'm out here making a living, I'm making a killing
For the billboard
But then some heavy folks behind me bought a Rolls Royce
1996 bitch, stackin' a grip - 'nother ship
Entering in a liquor store, purchasing a fucking a 5th
Memphis nigga heading down to Houston, Club Oasis
Different races, I met a bunch of faces
My pimping is getting stronger
I'm keeping my tone for you player haters
Beating bitches to the floor, making shit get regulated

[Hook: Playa G]
I've been wasting all my time
Fooling 'round with midnight hoes
I've been wasting all this time
Jumping in and out my clothes
I've been wasting all this time
Blowing indo out my nose
I've been wasting all this time
Now that's just how my life goes
Midnight hoes

[Verse 2]
Pimp them hoes, pimp them sluts, ride clean, smoke yo' dope
Keep a down beats for the rest of yo' life
Making that paper from coast to coast
I heard so many time a woman can be a mans weakness
I speak this pimping from experience fool now peep this
My baby is the queen of the shake junts
And I am the king of the playaz ball
You fuck one, will break one, pimp slap one, now smoke one
Make sure that its the ink
Now Juicy pass that Cristal to pimps, now toast that drink

[Bridge: Juicy J]
Now the tricks in the club got a hole in their pants
Broken drunk we tip our prophet tricks
Nutting off a table dance

[Verse 3]
While we go home baby jumped that ass in that tub
I count my bill money
Proud of my baby banging them scrubs
All of my life I've been looking
For one of the finest, the greatest of all of the women
To take to the top and I live with the best
But do many so many been fucking with Skinny
The realer of woman they wishing the best
Just to come from a million, the future I chose
The woman that hit me when I was fucked up
I've been wasting my time with these broke midnight hoes

[Hook: Playa G]
I've been wasting all my time
Fooling 'round with midnight hoes
I've been wasting all this time
Jumping in and out my clothes
I've been wasting all this time
Blowing indo out my nose
I've been wasting all this time
Now that's just how my life goes
Midnight hoes
