Fuck all them hoes who wanna talk that shit

If you real bring it on nigga

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Fuck what a nigga say about ya
The one who's talkin' shit is the ones who come go 'round ya
I'm tired of this hoe shit, no more Mr. Nice Guy
I'm loadin' up my nine if you wanna step or wanna try
If you think I'm all rap and you got some to prove
Come and get yo wig split Mr. MC Rudy Poot
Lucifer is waitin' for yo ass to sit next to him
If you get there quickly you can play yo cassette to him
Jealous ass niggas can't stand to see you ridin' clean
All on my fucking nuts, swinging from my dingeling
I can't understand why motherfuckers claimin' hard
Slangin' that they slangin' dope, knowin' that they cuttin' yards
Jumpin' in the G, ridin' ridin' ten niggas deep
Settin' ya ass up for a motherfuckin' street sweep
Duck motherfucker when ya see the gauge from the teint
Fucked up and tryin' to bomb bitch suck a mean dick

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Kick back, smokin' a fat sack with my nigga Crunchy Black
45 Glocks in our draws, Tec Nines in our back
-pack, fuck school I'm fixin to get fucked up
And take a trip to the Westside High to test some bitches luck
(?) me to fuckin' with some straight bitch
He tried to burn me then
I grabbed my yawk (?) to roll back, grip (?) my clip in
I put it to her head and told the hoe legit
Lookin' at a calendar, I saw five niggas
Who she fucked who she just met that day
I used to fuck with the hoe
But when she let them niggas houser
I grabbed the bible, weed and threw the bitch out my houser
Let the hoe experience pain in the worst form
Down ... rounds to a crown
Crown a hoe with the "Freak of the Year" award
And then chop a big booty ass down with a samurai sword
W-e-s-t-w-o-o-d H-o-e S-t-a- see I didn't finish spelling bee
So yo name ain't on my tape, hoe
