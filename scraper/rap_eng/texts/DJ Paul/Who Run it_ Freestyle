I was swerving in and out of traffic
Bitch I’m not a bastard
Moving faster
You a walking hazard
I will leave you staggered
You a flagger
Hit you wit a dagger 🗡
Bitch you know I’m badder
Michael Jackson
Dirty like Diana
And I’m back in action
Michael Blackson
Tell em kiss my ass and
Give me back my cash and
Let it happen
Ima give it to you
Since you beggin Askin
Now you hurt
Falling for that work
Now you know who anti
Watch her squirt
Coming out that skirt
Soaking up them panties
Now you hot
Wanna play some dress up
Dress up like the nanny
Now I’m hot
I be sayin water
Got you saying fan me
Why you hot?
Fucking wit the family
Know you understand me
You can’t stand me
Watch me come in handy
Hookin like I’m Sandy
Boy I eat you alive
Tell em all get in line
Oh you fw spies 🕵️‍♀️
The way you clocking my time
Ima flatten you out
Like what you talking bout
It ain’t too much that’s been known
But ima figure it out
Like I nigga it out
White people know that they say it
I’m thinking bigger about
You must not know I’ll spray it
Let’s consider about
How you gone feel
When they play this
And if you fuckin wit one
Just know I know he won’t say it
Tell me what was yo intentions
We gone see when you make it
Long living my life
Fuck a bitch if she trife
I put that shit on my life
My nigga Geezy
Will eat you
I bet he helped wit yo lines
I can’t wait till I see you
You ain’t even etched in stone
Get the white out
Ima flood the whole scene
And then ride out
Aye what did I do with my charger
I’m feeling larger
Moment you opened yo mouth
Moment you threw in the towel
Got yo ass looking like wow
It is yo fault you know now
Don’t give a fuck how you take it
Don’t give a fuck like I’m naked
Give me that pussy I rake it
You cannot stop me I made it
Wait...are you okay man?
Balling you looking like Kaman
I am Goku super Saiyan
I am not walking I drive
You run it to go run and hide
This is my scent like I’m tide
These niggas ain’t running shit from y’all mouths
Bitch my loogies more sick then the shit y’all talk bout
9-5 like 2 5’s That make 20’s in the middle
Got 2 m’s in my palms
Like they came with a McGriddle
Shitting on these niggas mains
Water but I’m flame
Make it hot
All around the world
Make em say my name
The way I rap
Make you think I’m passing
To another place
Late and great
I’m Just dropping bars
Like I’m holding weight
Oh you thought
Thought I was a sleeper
Why come for the reaper
Not in a Jeep or but you know I’m creeper
Shit start getting deeper
Wake me up
Put me in the truck
Now I know what’s up
Underground
Still rolling loud
Cudi dap 👊🏾 n pounds
I got rhymes from yesterday
Still gotta plate
For any niggas think they run shit
When it comes to making tapes
With that grape
Still fuck wit screw
Still fuck wit face
This rewarding
Who dat In New Orleans
This me saving grace
Yes I’m annoying
I annoy myself
Shit been getting boring
Heard them raps
I’m slapping my lap
Just to keep from snoring
I don’t really want the fan on me
Really I hit the fan homie
Please do not send yo mans on me
Unless they talking bout hands only
Still fill like the man homie
I ain’t even got bands on me
Let alone rubber bands on me
A nigga really feeling kinda lonely
Tia tamera
I could tell you sumn better the
Niggas couldn’t even fluff my feathers
I was thinking bout Ether
Either or you’ll never
Rapping like it’s 07
Comfortable are you gellin?
Hit yo hoe now you jealous
Locked right out of heaven
This forever and you know what’s better
For two like I’m preggers
From the nether
Why you listen to him
Like he want you better
Man whatever
I can’t wait to show em all
How much he cheddar
Not like cheese
But just more like deez
Nuts 🥜
Now who deader
I just came to take you under dog
Like Connor McGregor
Boy don’t tease me you greasy
And you know that you need me
Why you diss me come kiss me
And don’t lie say you missed me
I know you can’t stand the reign
But not the rain ☔️ that hit missy
I’m the substitute teacher
Give af bout attendance
And I just love reminiscing
How to walk when you crippin
Niggas spelling out blood
3rd grade set tripping
Red and blue flag gripping
Like what you claim
Bitch I’m Risen
On my last like Riven
Leave a pussy left dripping
You ain’t drove
You driven
Issa set up I’m sippin
Set you up for some shittin
But I know that’s a given
I was thinking bout school
And how it relates to prison
We still shining like prisms
Blame it on how I did em
You just wanna see me eat
No hard feelings I get it
