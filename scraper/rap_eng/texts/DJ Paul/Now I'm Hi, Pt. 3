[Verse 1: Playa Fly]
Fly so high in Funky Town, mega blunts I gotta smoke
Snowin', sneezin', coughin', chiefin', blowin' heavy holy dope
Playa fuckin' blessed by that funk, crunk by onion weed
Don't you think you higher than Lil Fly till you snort that P
P-funk got me goin',  hoe I'm blowin' on montana pack
Blunt just put me under but that snizow put me back on track
Bustas blinded by my smoke, how you like my smokin' screen?
Playa got that evil grin and Tony got me lookin' mean
Fly got swishers full of bling, time to snort a white ho bitch
Next she tell me Fly don't need it but Fly say "Mane fuck that shit"
Suckers fear my atmosphere, ho you should have open your ear
Groupie bitches hypnotized by devil shit you hate to hear
Standin' in the shower full of powder coca fuckin' cain
Hour by the hour ain't no coward cause I'm blowin' man
If you say I'm sprung, body numb, Triple 6 and Fly
Funky Town Fly bound and now I know you know I'm really high

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
Spooky midnight has fallen and now the moon is like lit up like much of the herb
The Indo is creating illusions, my thoughts are confusing, my vision is blurred
The aroma of the marijuana, the blackest of smoke changing into black clouds
Deep down in the dungeons my darkness of demonic secrets finally aroused
Your soul is horrified, flames falling from the sky
The Three 6 anti-christ, bloody seven seas
The blackness in my eyes, I hear an angel cry
Now I lay down to die, come and burn with me
In Scarecrow’s past life I killed kings and I ruled by the spilling of blood, flesh and guts
Now I'm back and I'm more murderous and I'm known as that mad nigga Lord Infamous
The Scarecrow could never come deep wit' that flow if I wasn’t so full of that dope – you know
Triple 6 blowin' that weed and we keepin' the seed and the stem
Roll a bag in a slim
When the lights are real dim then we grab the weed pipe and the bong and we take all that smoke to our lungs
A nigga got love for the bud and I'm smokin' it up until I'm feelin' numb
When I'm getting rushed by the shotgun and smokin' like it until da break of dawn
Seriously circulating while I’m devastating the souls with my sinister wand
