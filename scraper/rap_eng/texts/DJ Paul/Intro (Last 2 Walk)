[Intro]
Straight out the streets of Memphis, Tennessee
The robbery capital of the U.S
The Three 6 Mafia

Because of they Mystic Stylez
They Lived By They Rep 'til the end
Causing World Domination
And When the Smoke Cleared, they still was +Unbreakable+
Being the Most Known Unknowns
But after winning the Oscar only some would last due to pressure
And be the last man standing
DJ Paul and Juicy J, the Last 2 Walk

[Hook]
Smoke it up - what you do, what you do
Drank it up - what you do, what you do
Snort it up - what you do, what you do
Pop it up - what you do, what you do

[Verse 1]
I can hear the cries
Wishing they could turn back the hands of ti-i-i-i-i-i-i-i

[Outro]
Hahahaha! Aww man, get the fuck outta here
Your CD ain't messed up man
I had to fuck wit'cha a little bit
Cause I'm gone and I'm lit
But we finna give you some bump!"

{*scratching*} DROP THAT SHIT~!
