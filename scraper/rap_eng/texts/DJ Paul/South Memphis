South Memphiiis

[Verse 1]
Bustas better make way, killas off Southpark way
Deep as the pacific, villains in South Memphis
No-end territory, plenty ammunition
Niggas you best to be watchin' ya back 'cause we fuck up the competition
So come and get some 187 invitation
Burial insurance or some hospitalization
You never should step in the cell that I dwell in, you don't know what you play, trick
Slug to the skull and a permanent vacation
South Memphis flow and you know, that we loco dog
(?) in your throat as you choke off a blood clog
Teflon in your stomach, guts in your vomit
Wish to fuck up my hood but you ain't that dumb bitch
It's da Scarecrow, schizophrenic madman
Who rat out the south, trick run, run while you can
Slip up ya fucked up don't get ya spine slit
Trick, you can't fuck with South Memphis

[Verse 2]
Wiggedy-witness
The nigga that's droppin' the lyrics that's leavin' a motherfucka shitless
You lame ass gang niggas can't fuck with South Memphis, don't end up on my hit list
Don't make me click you weak ass tricks don't test my mental sickness
Lord Infamous the Scarecrow, tongue be twisted when I spit this
Wiggidy-what's up (?) watch me chief it
South Park Way is keepin' you slaw niggas beatin', you know that shit's no secret
So peep it, some niggas try to creep it
South Memphis rollin' deepest so I know you ain't got beef trick
And fuck a nigga who got a goddamn problem with it
Wanna confront my set? Get that gauge, bitch you best forget it
Trick in Lauderdale, South Park, over Victor
Bring yo ass, I bet the big block we'll get ya
Longview Heights, Cambridge bitch and Riverside
Alotta punk niggas brought they ass too and got fried
Scarecrow lettin ya know where it's at bitch
These lame motherfuckers can't fuck with South Memphis
