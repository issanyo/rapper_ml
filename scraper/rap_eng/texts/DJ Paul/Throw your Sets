[Verse 1: ​​​Lord Infamous]
Lord Infamous hella rough, we tearin every city up
Just rockin robbin knockin naughty kids
We layin cartridges, and droppin hostages, with no apologies
We breakin laws my nig, the slickest big business bitch
A war is in order, get a bullet and hit em hit em hit em
A motherfucker, I'm the gangsta that release the beast from hell
Yell out ya set, yell out ya set, yell, might as well
Get it CrazyNDaLazDayz
Stay blazed, take slaves, dig graves, bitch don't play
BLAY!

[Verse 2: Juicy J​​]
Comin' from the darkness of the cut up North Memphis bitch
Killers from the Evergreen Garden, we don't set trip
For my niggas doing time in 201 for their crimes
Let's get in the gangsta line and throw the funky town sign
I'm on that other level (level)
Go grab the shovel (shovel)
Cause many bodies droppin', several (several)
So meet the devil (devil)
Creep up with plastic or this wood (wood)
Cause hater would (would)
Run through our hood but our hood (hood)
Is like no good (good)
I wish you could (could)

[Verse 3: Never]
Representing all y'all on a mission
Tryin to make a bill, what you want what?
Never be buck, tear da club up better duck
Who that wanna take the opposition better throw it up
Its the Conflict and the Mafia Tre' 6 and us droppin ya
From the Chi-  but you won't drop, I'm poppin ya
I be the outcast till the last time and I'm
Puttin em up in the guillotine, you know what I mean
Swept you clean off your feet
Street sweep till the beat heat till you go seek and peak
What I mean your gree-dy, ain't we tricky
Who that was in the cut gettin rough?
Who that be? that be the Flict from Chicago to Memphis
Want stress and your emphasis on
Bullshit but you didn't know we was on

[Verse 4: Kilo]
Buck wildest walk Tennessee now, make Yankees wanna stay
Kilo been ready in Tennessee, got you ho, how you like Hennesey?
Can't help it to be bogus mayn, grew up pimpin and I done slanged
Gang banged with my foes, really didn't mind it hustlin's great
Desperado, and I chose my home
When I'm out there like an ice cold catacomb
Now in the storm, got ya rollin up the window
Keep your arms in so heat up
When it comes too crucial throw it up
Gettin scummy dirty money nigga throw your set up

[Verse 5: Wildstyle]​​​
Load the clip I'm known to rip up but you wanna get it on
Send up the Tech anybody wanna flex the Chi-
I'm a bet you die, when the bangers ride
Its a one-on-one war battle
Showdown for anybody want some get yourself knocked out
We bogus nigga, anty up trigger, Chi-Town killers
All mighty go getters, now what's it be like?
Flaggin my set, we outlaws, we creep our way
Bring it on gone getcha thug on
In the club better let it be known
Snappin and rappin em up when they came
With a gang fin to bang throw your set
Bet runnin loud buckwild, who is that?
Nigga throw up your set

[Verse 6: DJ Paul]
I was drinkin outta town rollin on these bustas (bustas)
They be actin like a bitch, they be actin like a ho
They be actin like a motherfuckin nigga that won't slow  roll
When the Tre' 6 Mafia tearz-that
Wherez-at niggas?
Comin feel these triggez you big and you bad
Don't allow playa hate when I'm comin thru
Bustin your ass where ya stand
Tear da Club up Thugs and the motherfuckin Flizict
For niggas in they camp
Nigga then here we go thru the motherfuckin click
Get some of they shoes on they leg
Whether niggas in the club, whether niggas in the streets
Ain't down with the snipes that be around
GD's, VL's, Crizips, Blizoods all hold they sets in the air

[Verse 7: Cold Hard]
Scandalous, came up to me, I done had enough of
That shit motherfuckers be sayin lookin at me
When they never even seen never heard of me
Cold Hard, guerillaty, hideous three
Power increase, Scarecrow release
Dangerously, turn to a beast
How can you breathe?
Never get over your under beneath
Mental get loose this is something to feed Flict
How the fuck you off when im in it
So aight you a damn vet
Crucial like me ain't seen nothing yet
Im fin to put your click in check
Gettin tore from the floor up better slow up
When you go up better claim ya set
