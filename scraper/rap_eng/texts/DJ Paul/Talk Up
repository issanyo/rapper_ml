Niggarz talking shit*7
On Twitter

I'm with my team and we is the truth
I could have have pulled up but none of you people could face with my crew
I see a lot of you guys tryna stunt on the gram
This is that talk that you never really heard
I hear your voice, better be quiet, I may get mad
Juice world talk in my lucid dreams
Erika Badu on my playlist
I'm on that Francis Sinatera
But my name Stunner if it's rapping imma veteran
I'm like Curtis when he went, platinum with the massacre
Imma Fan of Aubrey but I really wanna kill him
Drizzy be the man
Scorpion just dropped and I listened
Nice for what trash that's facts though
This ain't no diss you know I love the man
I mean put him on a pedestal
I bring the magic to the stage like I'm dynamo
If I put Grim on this shh, all you people better run
This beat really Knocking so I really had to kill it
My juice is major if you drink it'll turn you to a man
Uh
I am still rubbing off the paint
But I go hard in the paint
They say Cliff don't write songs Cliff don't freestyle

I hear Cliff don't even rap why you niggarz wanna be like him
Cliff don't wanna be in XXL as a freshman
Cliff don't play games Cliff don't shake hands
Cliff crazy he don't even care bout the money
Cliff play real life games he don't play fair
I could just make a lot of money when I talk crazy
I don't even talk about the money but I'll still talk crazy
When you hear me rapping better listen with a grain of salt
I got people that listening to me while they take notes

You know what am saying*4
Am the greater all you niggas carrots
They say talk is cheap all you niggas parrots
Am like a bunny rocking all this carrats

You know what am saying
Records hotter than a flame
Every record with my name
African Mafia gang
Ready to pull up bang
Bang bang bang
R.I.P X on time
We started from ill now we giving all the deals
From the ghetto to the hills and we making all the mills
Gated community am paying the bills
Garage full of wheels
I can tell you how it feels *2
You know what am saying
Living fast never switching lanes
Lemme see you hands if you know what am saying
