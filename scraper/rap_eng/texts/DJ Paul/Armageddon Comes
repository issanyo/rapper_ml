[Repeated in background of Hook 1] [DJ Paul]
Stomp the doors in and then I got em'
Look the busta dead in his face and I shot em'

[Hook 1] [Lord Infamous]
Nina, milli, military killer
Feel my strategy warfare nigga
Nina, milli, military killer
Feel my strategy warfare nigga

[Hook 2: Lord Infamous]
We come to take this bitch by storm
Nigga grab ya arms
Prepare, Armageddon comes
Take this bitch by storm
Nigga grab ya arms
Prepare, Armageddon comes

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Ya stuck up in the wrong part of town, M-Town-M-Town is on trey
Representin' nine to five, it's time I hit a snowflake
They got me on a cheese chase
I had to test one, my fingerprints was on his face
I had to tell son, ya rollin' with some niggas on a Cognac tip
Too many snort, the rest of em' got that weed in that dip
We ain't gon' call this shit a night until I get alright
Me and my nigga was searchin belles till I get some tight

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
I bringin' out shit that's gon' bring hell, so fuck yo bulletproof vest
And I be the best when it come to arson as I'm blazin' up in this shit
I got chu' faded cause the lady that I be is in me
I'm chargin' all you sucker niggas, never fuckin' for free
I'm takin' homes like storms, I'm droppin' lyrics like bombs
I'm comin' quick to leave ya quick cause ho I be like the one
We goin' platinum on ya ass so hold this stick while I pee
Let's keep it on the down low bro cause you ain't heard it from me

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
Me be the murderer motherfucker, servin' 'em musical felony
Bring em' in above the killers yellin' better deadly melody
With the infamy, everyone of my victims slept in misery
Since the embassy with the chief
That lost the best in lyrical sorcery
Takin' a life in a second, me spliting ya neck off with the guillotine
All you niggas fear of me, pay for the women see
Let the killer do the job and I promise you won't feel a thing
I'm on a killin' spree, of course it's me, that nigga that gives no mercy, see

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
You know niggas make plans, I'm the beater man
But I'm just a young ass nigga with Glock in hand
Every time ya see me in the streets I ain't rollin' deep
Cold fuckin' plastic on the seats, don't cha' fuck with me
Comin' from a city where niggas be slangin' dope and snortin' cane
Memphis niggas step up in this house, hoe we runnin' thangs
Hooked with these Houston niggas now the plan is to get thicker
Prophet Posse, Houston Mafia on a mission, gettin' richer, bitch
