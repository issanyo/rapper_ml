[Hook]
You broke rule number one
Do not, do not, do not, do not, steal, from me

[Verse 1]
Kick them bitches out my business trick, the Koop has something for 'em
A mothafuckin' *bang* a nigga knock with a warrant
I'm knowing I gotta touch 'em, knowing I gotta buck 'em dead
Now bumpin' bitches heads got me running from the fucking Feds
Kick it with my dreads, all years and still been on them slabs
You say lil' Koop ain't coming clean, mane I'll be damned
Buck 'em down
You clown just gain some inches 'fore you get sprayed
Scandalous is that killa pimping Koopsta Knicca clickin' with that mothafuckin' twelve gauge
I made 'em face the grave and laid his shit right down my nig
I hit him real quick, then counted up my dividends
A rebel's in me, got me sinning, nigga why you grinning?
There's no forgiveness, tell me, should I let you keep on living?
Grab me a four, kicked in them doors like the night before
Man hit them floors or be a ugly looking in the morgue
Body sore, broken skull, ho I took your life
Six hundred 666, census of a judgement night

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got a knock on my door, man, who is it, bitch?
Is it my niggas from the mothafuckin' Triple 6?
Get out my head, I'm scared, know soon, you might be dead
Don't make me cut you in dreads inside a homestead
Tonight's the night to make a pimp-tight fright-night
We cut them bodies in chunks done by a butcher-knife
I buck 'em dead on the double cause I don't need no trouble
Man what the fucks a muscle to a playa body's hustle?
My Glock goes pop and pop and make them niggas drop
Come take a ride to my mothafuckin' Stash Pot

[Interlude: DJ Paul]
Aww, yeah the Triple 6 Mafia in this mothafucka. With my nigga the Koopsta Knicca. We doing this shit for all the niggas who stay down, you know I'm saying? And for all the niggas who couldn't take it, the shit just get thicker for a weak nigga, biatch! (Triple 6, Triple 6, Triple 6 niggas)
