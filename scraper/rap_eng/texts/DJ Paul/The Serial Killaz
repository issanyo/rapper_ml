[Intro: Lord Infamous]
Don't make a sound
Be very quiet
Just listen
He’s comin' for you
Ya better listen
As I tell da story of a twisted psycho
Lord Infamous but you can call me Scarecrow

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
A serial killa institution in Memphis, Tennessee
Known for the ways he mutilated the bodies
In the psychiatric ward, he was comatose very deeply
A few months later awoke and broke out the facility
They neva had a clue where he fleed
But it's believed he escaped somewhere deep in the county
Some says he stalks the corn fields
Waitin’ for farmers and lost kids
Cuz he creeps up, kills them
He's a true muthafuckin' loc
The son of the Devil
The goddamn coat under black moon
Cut mothafuckas up from sickle to garden tools
Those fools who dare enter da crop was doomed
Those who doubted the tale of the crop would be chopped chopped and chopped into little muthafuckin parts
Some teenager fooled around in the corn field
And later he found soaked in blood with they skin peeled
Little kids go in and play and get lost
Six days rotten with they heads popped off
Sometimes you'll look deep in the field at the wood post
Hanging the bodies you may glimpse The Scarecrow

[Interlude I]
Crazy ass nigga
The Lord Infamous
[?]
You run and hide
You can't escape it

[Verse II: Lord Infamous?]
There's a nigga in the field
He's gonna kill ya
Gotta take him out
A nigga in the field
He's gonna kill ya
Gotta take him out
Do what ya can
Watch ya back
Slippin’ on that
Scarecrow will attack
Murda weapon a sickle
[?]
Chop chop ’em up is what I said in another track
And if you remember the Scarecrow escaped from the institute a while back
But now he's in the corn field growin’ some new crops
In the leg chop chops from ya pops
The cops tried to catch him
They sent undercover
He react by cop slaughter by a tractor
[?]the sickle split ya head in half
And he laughs as you pass away
[?]flesh as you decay
But the flesh'll be[?]
I guess this his taste the way ya skin on his fuckin' face[?]
Late at night you hear the screams as the yak go
You can't run or hide from The Scarecrow

[Interlude II]
"Hey thinks I stay here all the time
He doesn’t know what I really do
I go out
People don't come here anymore so I have to go out to the highway
My brother doesn't like me to do that stuff
He pretends he doesn't even know about my power
POWER"

[Verse III: Lord Infamous]
You can't hide from The Scarecrow
He smells ya blood
Disfigure bodies and chop some flesh in the mud
You run for your life but the corn field's like a maze
The Scarecrow's gonna peel your skin off with the blades
It's night
You're lost in the crop and you can't sleep
Someone's lurkin' in the darkness, you cannot see
You're scared to death wondering could it be The Scarecrow
Tears streamin' down ya face as the wind blows
You move different through the field[?]a new resting place
You look up and The Scarecrow's starin' in ya face
Your hands on the choppin' block
The sickle takes 'em clean off
He picks 'em up and place it on top of a corn stalk
When niggas be steppin'[?]
The Scarecrow was stabbin' that blade in they flesh
He loves when he makin' them bleed
Late at night, you hear the screams if ya listen close
It's comin' from the corn field
It's The Scarecrow

[Outro]
Scarecrow
Scarecrow
Scarecrow
(They call me Lord Infamous but you can call me Scarecrow)
