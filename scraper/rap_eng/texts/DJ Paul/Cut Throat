[Juicy J: Hook]
Niggas so cut throat they robbin' own brother (Damn)
Hurtin' their own mother (Damn!)
I think this shit gutter
Niggas so gone off that beacon
They don't evem thinkin' 'bout the risk, they take it

[Juicy J: Verse 1]
Your life go flash before your eyes from the .45
Bullet's duck piled up in your head nigga you can die
Hyde Park Mafia is the click down from homicides
All of us are murders, that you heard bro it ain't no lie
Niggas got murked, kiddnapped even bodies tied
Took out with a trigger or with a throat slit peoples workin' wild
So much game violence in the hood, how you stay alive?
Always watch your back and keep it real but they still ain't fine
Missle crack your head over he say she say
Six street to the man from the lane to you damn grave
Beggars if they see this is real, you can't do that
Spread word like you sellin' dope, you undercover rat

[Juicy J: Hook x2]

Niggas so gone off that beacon

[Project Pat: Verse 2]
40 racks, 50 racks slanging niggas dummies packs
An 14 shoted to your head, where the money at?
Get your olders, yeah they told us that u were here ridim' ours
Spending money on these hoes, I see that you lost your focus
Psycho crazy like a Joker, fool this ain't no comic book!
Known of the choppers with guns, Crook By The Book
Gone passed your momma house, your boys saw me ridin'
Cause shooting off your momma house, will bring you what I hidin'
And they owe me 10 racks, cause a soldier have a brick
But dope ain't with your buddies wait what they got to do with it?
Pistol with me I'm like a cooker, beats yo brains out like a hooker
Weed full in a fiff pack it, pistol in his mouth I cock it!

[Brisco: Verse 3]
See they locked me in lecture, I will put that real in their ears
No table manners, no morals and no respect for your peers
Gonna be a recession, I got them stressin' for dollars
Got them lookin for troubles and got them totin' their choppers
I remember what my old girl told me
She say all niggas cut throat, and all these hoes phoney
That is bearing in my head, my question get bakin'
And I will be damn if I let any motherfucker take it
Mafia! It's lot of us, touring in the larger bus
Fuck  goin' to jail, esctasios for larger cust'
We all know bakin' soda make a lot fam
And we all know hard head, make a soft affair
