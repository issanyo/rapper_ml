[Intro]
Yeah DJ Paul KOM
Lord Infamous in this hoe
We "Unfuckwitable" man
That mean no person, nothing, no shit can fuck your mood up right about now
Fuck these suckers, they can't touch me
I'm killin' these bitches

[Bridge] 2x
Fuck that busta, fuck that busta
Kill that sucker, kill that sucker

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Unfuckwitable
Haters wanna make me mad but they can't
Brand new whip, candy rims full of paint
Still ballin' like before, what ya think?
Puttin' millions in this bank
I'm Unfuckwitable

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]

[Bridge] 2x
Fuck that busta, fuck that busta
Kill that sucker, kill that sucker

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Unfuckwitable
Haters wanna make me mad but they can't
Brand new whip, candy rims full of paint
Still ballin' like before, what ya think?
Puttin' millions in this bank
I'm Unfuckwitable

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
I'm doin' shit that get you centuries in penitentiaries
You ever mention me - severe the injury
I eat yo face for meat, forsaken me
You reekin' in the creek, your corpse is fatal beat
I sever the head with machete
You niggas beheaded with devilish injuries
Knocked 'em off the bleachers
Razor blades will fuck up your features
Fuckin' with the Infamous creature
Get you hit with the heat seeker
Lord the heroin Don, coke Capone
Hail Mary, hail Glock, it's on
Drama, llama, put 'em in a trauma
Don't go home alone

[Bridge] 2x
Fuck that busta, fuck that busta
Kill that sucker, kill that sucker

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Unfuckwitable
Haters wanna make me mad but they can't
Brand new whip, candy rims full of paint
Still ballin' like before, what ya think?
Puttin' millions in this bank
I'm Unfuckwitable
