Who run it I run it
No you don’t want it
I kick it I punt it
Keep it a hunnid
Dissin nobodies, I am above it
Feel like a rock star pop pillies to numb it
Haters I’m shunnin
Yeah I been stuntin
Pipes I been plumbin
I am so clever
I am so cunnin
You’s Cecil I’m a dentist so let’s go huntin
Rapper of the year
You don’t appear
To fear me
A superior lyricist
Mad flow I don’t use periods
I am no joke I spit serious
Spittin so fast it makes you delirious
Not just fast I be so furious
My shit hotter than curry is
Are you hearin this, I’m just curious
I run the game like it’s Usain
Cannot be tamed
Rap insane
Fuck up ya membrane
You’s lame
Club go up on a Tuesday
You'll be dead if you don’t get it by the due date
Ya I get paid
I’m a bad rapper who say that
Yo gon burst into flames like a race track
Your whole career I’ll erase that
Yo where ya plays at
Dope rhymes yeah I made that
All ya fans they play that
Betta stay back
Shoot you down that line gon stay flat
Gonna have to get a teardrop face tat
Just face it
Yous a basic
Replacement
I’m a spaceship racin to first place while you chasin
This Asian gon pound ya face in like Jason
I’m in the left lane
Cuz I’m passin
All y’all faggots
You Ain’t had the
Talent, you’s lackin
Fake like a ramen noodle packet
That’s why u ain’t added
To the group chats
Zero dark the motherfucking pack
We never gonna stop dropping tracks
Go Zeke and run it back
Strap up and attack
Girl look like a snack
Give that ass a smack
Till it not intact
Hit it from the back
Smash that like Shaq
Boy you lack
Rock you all like crack
I’m the Masta call me Jack
I been gassed up stacks on stacks
You meek I’m drake back to back
Blast ya back to Iraq
My words so wise vocab attack
That’s a fact, smack a wack rapper back like a Cracker Jack
Attack the track
You know I’m packin racks
Chillin in the tabernacle
ASAP pretty flacko
Bait like tackle
And the gat go
Yacko on a smack ho
Betta back off
Or your brain be scrabbled
Memories be scrambled
Mess with me that’s a gamble
Grip the choppa I'm Rambo
Turn you red like a tampon
Eat up that soup, that’s why they call me Campbell
