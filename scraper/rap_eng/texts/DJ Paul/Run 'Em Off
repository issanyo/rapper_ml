[Lord Infamous sample]
Mafia

[Hook: OG Maco] 2x
Run 'em off, all my niggas won't say nothin'
Run 'em off, all my niggas won't say nothin'
Oh Lord, prayin' my niggas they stay thuggin'
Oh Lord, prayin' my niggas they stay thuggin'

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
I hit the club with the top off
Rolls Royce drop (?) which I dropped off
Walk up in that bitch slo-mo, leanin' sideways
We already been blowin' since the highway
V.I.P, already on some list shit
Already got some bad bitches on my guest list
They already know the biz, they ain't gotta guess it
After the club and the Moet every hoe get a dick
And they let a nigga smoke on that magic
(?) in the club (?) automatic
Drinkin' on them magnums, pocket full of magnums
If it pop off -  .357, a magnum

[Hook: OG Maco] 2x
Run 'em off, all my niggas won't say nothin'
Run 'em off, all my niggas won't say nothin'
Oh Lord, prayin' my niggas they stay thuggin'
Oh Lord, prayin' my niggas they stay thuggin'

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
What the fuck you lookin' round for


Rap niggas get it all day where I'm from here

Fuck around and kickin' in ya mom door
Shot through the side, through the back (?)
I know nigga, trick trick tongues out
This a motherfuckin no fly zone nigga

[Hook: OG Maco] 2x
Run 'em off, all my niggas won't say nothin'
Run 'em off, all my niggas won't say nothin'
Oh Lord, prayin' my niggas they stay thuggin'
Oh Lord, prayin' my niggas they stay thuggin'

[Verse 3: Compton Menace]


[Hook: OG Maco] 2x
Run 'em off, all my niggas won't say nothin'
Run 'em off, all my niggas won't say nothin'
Oh Lord, prayin' my niggas they stay thuggin'
Oh Lord, prayin' my niggas they stay thuggin'
