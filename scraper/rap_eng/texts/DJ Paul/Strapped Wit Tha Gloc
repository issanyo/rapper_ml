(Chorus: DJ Paul and Gangsta Blac)
My nigga strapped with the Glock and it's cocked
About to shoot you, Bitch
Don't you ever, Don't you ever try to test my nuts

(Verse 1: Lil Jyule)
Raised on Richmond Street, Kicking in Southward
The plane's about to leave, So bitches come on board
You hoes don't want none, Niggas come get you some
Don't come along punk, You'd better bring your fucking gun
I'm high cause I'm chiefing sack, I'm chilling with blizo mack
We rolling Rochelle's thang, We drinking a pint of Yak
These niggas ain't really shit, They cross me out over bitch
I'm keeping my fucking my cool, My mind's about to click
I'm high as a motherfucker, I'm ready to kill a sucker
I'm buying this fucking tone as soon as I see that buster
These niggas can't fade me, A hoe can't rape me
I know I'm a player fool, I bust hoes daily
I'm rapping on this motherfucking beat by the Triple Six
Blood that was born in me, I'm flizzock with my Glizzock bitch
(Talking): Aw yeah, It's Lil Jyule in this motherfucker, Kicking shit with DJ Paul and Lil Fly, Don't you ever try to test my nuts!

(Chorus: DJ Paul and Gangsta Blac)

(Verse 2: Playa Fly)
Hoe you wanna test my nuts, Anna's what I'm thinking be
S.P.V. we strapping with them Glocks, Down with R.I.C
Clicking on you suckers talking shit about a funky hoe
Stick that tone up to your dome
And lay your bitch ass on the floor
Motherfuckers talking shit, Anna got me clicking lemon
Jealous cum catching nigga bustas trying to test Fly pimping
Mega blunts they got me bleak and thinking of another flow
Expose you buster suckers so my nigga Jyule up in this hoe
Richmond Street and North Ridge Click Devil blood of Triple Six
Time to diss a funky hoe, You know suck a player's dick
Hoe you wanna play some games
Now you know I've had enough
Go and get so strizzapped with that Glock Pop you in your gut
Fly don't give a fuck because you hot, So get off my jock
Keep on spreading fucking rumors
Then, I'm knocking off your socks
Don't show your ass around here hoe
But you better not get so buck
Cause when you see Fly's skin and grin
Bitch, Lil Fly's gone test your nuts

(Chorus: DJ Paul and Gangsta Blac)

(Verse 3: Lil Jyule)
Swinging early Sunday morning smoke up in my head
Money on my bed I need a blizzant cause my nigga's dead
Jumping in the 1,500 rolling with my nigga Lil Mont
Just scooped up my rollie Mont, So you know I got that blunt
I got a pistol on my hip, Got a blizzant stuck between my lips
Ski mask on, Got my tone, Now I'm finna take a trip
A player doing it Richmond style no realer pimping by the mile
When I chief the blizzants guaranteed to get buckwild
Ganking niggas everyday when I drink that Conveyance
Knocking busters out when I'm high off of smoking hay
Got a bag for my nigga, Now I'm finna pull the trigga
On this busta trick who shot a cross at this Richmond nigga
Let me beep my rollie Mont, Tell him bring my fucking gun
Shot a busta trick ass nigga, Now I'm on the fucking run
Running for my life, I cannot stop the force is coming, G
25 cops strapped with Gats trying to kill me

(Chorus: DJ Paul and Gangsta Blac)
