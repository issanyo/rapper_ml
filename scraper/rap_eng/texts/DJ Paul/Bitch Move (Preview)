[Hook x2: Lil Jon]
Bitch move! Bitch move!
Bitch move! Bitch move!
Bitch move motherfucker!
Bitch move motherfucker!

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Where my niggas, where my niggas?
Man-man my niggas so ruthless
Leave a nigga in the club toothless
See I run up out the booth less
[?]
Gang shit, my haters they weak as shit
Even out of town we on Memphis shit
Nigga [?] you gon' witness it
I wild a nigga with a .45
Nigga better run for their lives
Why people actin' so surprised?
They finna [?], we live
All up in the club gettin' buck with all my guys
Smokin' on the dance floor like dude we super high
Crashin' through the crowd we moshin' try'na get by
Pushin' niggas to the floor, stampedes, somebody gon' die

[Hook x2: Lil Jon]
Bitch move! Bitch move!
Bitch move! Bitch move!
Bitch move motherfucker!
Bitch move motherfucker!

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
