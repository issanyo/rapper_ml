[Hook]
(Let's start a motherfucking riot in this bitch!)
When we crash through your crowd
Throwin' chairs, breakin' jaws
Actin' a damn fool, yellin' "Motherfuck these laws"

[Verse 1]
They creepin' up on a come up so it's time to make my move
I got my killas down in Memphis, ain't nobody gon' be cool
I'm kickin' with Rap-A-Lot family, I was down like 24/7
I scope Flesh Bone trick-ass slippin', I got my weapon
Mr. Slick in the 'lac with them Tennessee drive-by tags
Drillin' the 5th Ward Boyz to fifth ward
We smokin' a bag of that weed dipped in wet
We in the set showed us love
But really I can't get it out my head
That I got anna with them Bone Thugs
We was at the studio with Face, Doo and Little J
Payin' 'em dues at jammin' record shop
Everyday and every way
Lee and Stan believin' a nigga that keepin' a playa livin' it tight
Convincing me to stay down
Cause it ain't gon' happen over night
But I couldn't wait
I wanted to put them Bone Thugs in my trunk
I'm kickin' it with the Prophet hoe
For any nigga wanna feel this pump
Come and get ya some in the club, in the hood or coliseum
I'm down with the gang world wide
Let's start a motherfuckin' riot with them bitches

[Hook]
(Let's start a motherfucking riot in this bitch!)
When we crash through your crowd
Throwin' chairs, breakin' jaws
Actin' a damn fool, yellin' "Motherfuck these laws"

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin' my best to come up in this game
See I was a long way from home
I'm packin' my nuts, tryin' to see glory
Hoping I don't have to fire up this chrome
I'm drinkin' that bumpy face Vodka
Straight prepared for my enemy to creep
As I unload I'm takin' his soul
Cause Skinny Pimp mastered these streets
Jammin' on that thug-life showing no mercy
Hustlin', strugglin' to live
I wanna start a riot with East '99
North Memphis projects too trill
Breakin' up the club, we smokin' the bud
You'll get done up we down with the Acres Homes
Killers that down with that homicide drive-by
Owning the streets we dwellin' on
Livin' by my rep, I'mma let my heat melt yo vest
And any nigga dissin' Gimisum pour Hennessy on his chest
When we crash through your crowd
Throwin' chairs, breakin' jaws
Actin' a damn fool, yellin' "Motherfuck these laws"
With a frown, full of that fry, ready to die, I'm too high
Three Six got my back, now throw your hood in the sky
We beatin' 'em down, then we shootin' 'em down
Skinny ain't soft
Let's start a riot like they did when Martin Luther King got his ass blowed off
Like Black Panthers did

[Hook]
(Let's start a motherfucking riot in this bitch!)
When we crash through your crowd
Throwin' chairs, breakin' jaws
Actin' a damn fool, yellin' "Motherfuck these laws"

[Verse 3]
Now as I breathe in light green
I get stranded, brain damage
I'm leavin' niggas in bandage
By breakin' the ten commandments
When we march into your place
With them gauges and AK's
It ain't no reason for you to be duckin'
Cause I be aimin' at yo face
When I be goin' through a thang better be scared to say my name
When you hang keep a gang
Skimask Troopaz got you ranged
In the presence of his kids, a nigga like me don't give a damn
My associates is killers
Puttin' them bitches up under the ground
We comin' so thick
For niggas who thinkin' they thicker than my hood
Death row niggas be sentenced to die
We causin' a riot, I'm shakin' hoes with a walk-by
I stand by for the door to open then we run into your cell
Sticking up you with them ? bitch
Usin' that Woodlawn junky skill
Taking your foold, taking your shoes, you can't even fall asleep
Callin' the guards every five minutes when we finna creep
I got a plan to escape from inside to outside
Bitch if you ain't scared, let's start a riot

[Hook]
(Let's start a motherfucking riot in this bitch!)
When we crash through your crowd
Throwin' chairs, breakin' jaws
Actin' a damn fool, yellin' "Motherfuck these laws"
