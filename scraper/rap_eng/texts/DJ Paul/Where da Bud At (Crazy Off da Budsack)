[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Sometimes I just wonder how come I commit all these murders when full of the ganja
I smoke up the second, I load up the full metal jacket
Like I'm in a trauma
Drama, the drama begins to blow up
Indo blunts like then I let off the fuse for all the niggas with doctors
Then I post with the nina, the nina, I roll up a blizzunt as thick as my finger
Watch as I choke off this spliff and rip them niggas like wars in Korea
Chief of the reefer, the cause of a hundred acres down in Panama
When the smoke fills my jaws I wanna kill bitches with chainsaws
Doc, I close the doors and windows and get lost in the fog
The smoke is so thick in my room I can't even see the fucking walls
Chase it down with a 6-4 ounce of beer every day as a sequel
Then I want to go and murder some bitches with a 50 caliber Desert Eagle
Deeper, steeper, damn I'm full of reefer, peep the creeper, I don't like you neither
Nigga, know you got that shit, fool, where the shit at?
Scarecrow, I get so crazy off the bud sac

[Hook]
Crazy off the bud sac
Crazy off the bud sac
Scarecrow, I get so crazy off the bud sac
Crazy off the bud sac
Crazy off the bud sac
Scarecrow, I get so crazy off the bud sac
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud sac
Crazy off the bud sac

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
As I chief up on the leaf, a swisher sweet
I see this nigga, he is tryin to creep, on me, Lord Infamous
Call me the Scarecrow, ammo -full clip unload, this nigga smoked
Now he gone, didn't believe this song, I shoot that tone
It goes﻿ on, and on and on, and on and on
(I'm the zone?), my mind it floats, off indo dope
Ain't no hope as I peep through the scope, with the bud in my throat
So it's lit, fuck up your shit with panic off the blinker
Evacuate the fucking area cause I'm so sinister with the street sweeper
Deeper, I'm deeper than devils that drill in the depths of Haiti's
Maybe I'm hazy -the hizzit is gotten me crazy
I'm dazing I'm dazing, always so amazing
Spray these﻿ sagging glazing gaunga bizzich hit it says me
Cock back the gat, then I lay down a few sheets, pack the zig zags
No love jack, nigga where the bud sac?

[Hook]
Crazy off the bud sac
Crazy off the bud sac
Scarecrow, I get so crazy off the bud sac
Crazy off the bud sac
Crazy off the bud sac
Scarecrow, I get so crazy off the bud sac
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud sac
Crazy off the bud sac
