[Hook]
Silked up like a dough boy, smellin' like Fahrenheit
Motherfucker whatcha gunna do

[Verse 1: Koopsta Knicca]
Since ya niggas from the ville they got to fuck me just to get em mane
Fuckin with that 6 double 6 - it's gonna be a fright night
Paul let's make nigga knocking
Point that Glock at them bitches faces
The pistol play, that Koopsta Knicca
Gone on a motherfuckin rampage
Clicking with that 9 in hand, let's make this to another stang
Scarecrow with that satanic bible, tell me where's the Killa Man
[edited] God let's take this on another ride
Juicy with that Tec-9, let's turn this to a homicide
666 now burning shit, let's make this to a crucifix
Chopped up in a fucking ditch
We clickin like Jeffrey Dahmer's bitch
Bitch in my yard is where your body be well exposed
Its 6 double 6 mafia click slanging licks on you funky hoes
Ya scared, ya scared because I dwell with that evil dead
I bled them bodies, I left the blood running in your bed
The Koopsta's a psycho nigga, you got tools, I got mine too
A Glock to yo body fool, now Whatcha Gonna Do?

[Hook]
Silked up like a dough boy, smellin' like Fahrenheit
Motherfucker whatcha gunna do

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Glocks, Tec-9's, Uzis at yo motherfucking face
No fear, quickly watch a fucking murder take place
Place me a trick in my guillotine
Chop his cock off and see how fast we can make his mother scream
We means no fuckin niceness when we around
My Glock make this sound *pop* when I buck down clowns
Funky Town cause you to be slippin and feel like trippin'
And fallin' under spells given by my demon tells me
How ya gunna get with my 6 double 6, 6 million 6 hundred and 60 thousand crazies that i click with wickedness
I shoulda have test you before I let you down in my boat
But now I push you over to watch you struggle to stay afloat
We drop a rope straight around your throat, let's see if he chokes
When I trip of this weed and put the ship in high speed
Always wanna have ya fuckin' way like a ho
This Triple 6 shit don't stop, so what the fuck you gonna d-o?
Trick ass nigga
