[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
Now that- now that motherfuckers get the feelin' of this shit
This shit so funky cause we underneath the grounds of Triple 6
I'm smokin' out, I'm livin' large, I keep you hataz out my face
Yo life is over motherfucka, when I grab ahold that gauge
My niggas from the Three 6 click, they keep me hooked up on that game
I'm chargin' niggas daily maybe, lady is out to get paid
You hoes can't fuck wit me, I'm flowin', showin', hoes I ain't no hata
Comin' strictly from the South-side gettin' greater later
Everybody wanna gossip, he say, she say this and that
You suckas need to grow up out that kiddy shit
Quit fakin' just cause da Three, Six, Mafia
Coming nine-six, to two G's bitch
Ms. Lady Gangsta on that weed, kickin real shit
Just to let you know my partner ho come on the scenery
Scenery, filled with red dots, infrared beams
Now where you gon' go? You can't hide, your life is over kid
It's time for the killin' cause you have fucked up with the wrong ass bitch

[Verse 2: DJ Paul & Juicy J]
Man this nigga kill me
Tellin' these people that he's about to go nationwide
When he gotta drop his tapes off hisself
Plus he gotta call drunk to get a ride
I saw the motherfucka standin' out in front ah Best
Talkin' about, bout my tape
The nigga talk about the hard shit on that tape
Knowin' he sweet as cake
The type ah nigga to tell these hoes
That's he about to blow the fuck up
The only blowin' up bitch you doin'
Is when I stick the grenade in your butt
Since Im smokin them mega blunts

Hit that ill shit
You Primo buyer
Juice mane I know what you sayin'
These hoes be killin' me ever so softly
But little bit a bitch boy know

Don't forget about the day
You enraged, after you got that page
From a doctor from the health department
Tellin' you are infected wid AIDS
This ho boy holdin' card
Was a mad bit than he bought for the two pon it
Then he got fucked signed his contract
You bitch boy you's a fuckin' dummy
Lookin' tryna deal wid big time cars, still put 'em on dem CDs
Dumb nigga you'll never sell more than the Three 6

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
Infamous is comin' strapped like an Italian-Arabic-Iraqie-Iranian-South American-cuban-guerilla-colombian-muslim, a subgroup maniac
Comin' to rip your damn head off your neck, put your heart in a bag, then I sprinkle yo ash
Headin' straight to tha headquarter, chief on the blunt of the Indica down in my stash
I reside in the insane asylum, the bodies I pile 'em
On Infamous Island where there is no smilin'
The niggas buck-wildin', the weapons are silenced
There's nothing but violence
Military barbarian, buck 'em and bury 'em
Fuck with the scarier insanitarium, pallbearer carry 'em
There's no merry love, only murder blood
Then I take something worst
Out of all of these hollow points burst in disperse
Going through flesh and bone through the back of your shirt
You be burnt up and buried in dirt, that'll work
The Scarecrow be smokin' these niggas for shit they can't get with, these bitches they'll never compare
I'm comin' from the land of Triple 6, niggas still sufferin' every day man, I swear

I see them fuckin' press, oh no they better lay
It happens everyday don't make me grab the gauge
Dangerously I play, I blast out yo rib cage
And put ya body in the back of that grey Chevrolet
