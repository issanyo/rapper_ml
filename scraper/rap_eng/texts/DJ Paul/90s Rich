[Verse: 1 Peter Jackson]
They say budget gotta be a mill
They said, "I heard he signed a new deal"
Heard he whippin' that Range, or that 550-CL
Gotta be that dog like it was '96
From the Metro Zoo like I was mind tricks
Rest in peace to my side chick
I just married my main bitch
Old money that's so old money
Tucked away and grew more money
Rolled up with your earn money
Burn that like I earn money
2013 with a little bread from that safe
Bought that new house but that's all bread that we cake
Hold up, wait do whatever for the paper
Pocket full of hunnids and a room full of haters
Heard you mad bitch, your mad I made it?
Tell your boyfriend I'm fucking famous
By the way you can kiss my anus
This ain't grade nine and you still basic
I get mine bitch and you get wasted
How the fuck that feel? Tasteless

[Hook]
Mo' money thats so old money
Tucked away and get mo' money

[Verse: 2 D.J. Paul]
Keep on ducking don't use it
Keep my name out yo' music
Couple hunnid thousands, shit you nigga's jump like you clueless
I do it, Basemont nigga i'll split yo wig
Pour it in your house down 3 little pigs
Money on your head I'll make that bid
Pimp C said don't burn your bridge
You ride our shit but a nigga might
End a nigga night then catch a flight
Bet you can't fuck with a nigga like
Cause you need her space like Gigabytes
I'm working and while I'm sitting I'm tryna get blown
Click Clack better lower your tone
Penetentry is where they'll leave me alone
And I'll put up more hits good heads the most
I advise you nigga's to watch out (watch out)
Ride around town with the Glock out (Glock out)
We jump so many hoes with a knock out (knock out)
We could talk about it alone I don't give a fuck 'bout (fuck 'bout)
You nigga's trust-less, nigga I'm rolling horses side
Cocky bumping Ralph Lauren, tell your Julio horses

[Hook]

[Verse: 3 3D Na'Tee]
From the New Orleans
My niggas ride with that Kobe
And every other day is a war scene
No chill, nigga's toke still
And coke deal, with more pills than a Walgreens
Fuck a ball team
Nigga show me where the cake at
For the state cake with a bake set
Tryna get chips and risk it and wreck it like Asap
Catch you slippin' I'm a take that
Pistol with a weight set
Put you in the four with the basement
Tryna eat motherfucker where the plates at?
Soul niggas on my condomy streets
Soul rats never speak like consequence
Hahaa
See a better beast
Disaram put a music and fleas
Ridin' in a jeep
23s on her feet
And the city on the seat
Duckin' the police
Ain't no other chick that is bad as this
I rep for the streets and the savages
And with this rapper shit
I kill nigga's like a black Jodi Arias
I make it happen bitch
I'm the catalyst
I know you use to pass on rapper chicks
But everything I get on, I bury it
3-D-Na-Tee not your average bitch!
Hahaa

[Hook]

[Verse: 4 Joell Ortiz]
Let me ask ya'll this, what the fuck ya'll want?
Came from the fifth make my whole arm jump
You never been cool, I remember you in school
Me and all of my nigga's use to take ya'll lunch
Ain't no thang it's the same ol' same
Your name may have changed but I know you
Victim of extortion is that you flossin'
Have you stop by for an IOU
Homeroom teacher said I won't be shit
Look at everything that I won't be bitch
Won't be a rapper, won't be sick
Yeah I'm nothing like you, cause you won't be rich
You can only teach Geography, I see Geography
Share a flight and I'll laugh
That'll be the first time Ms. Herkstein was absent from the first class
And I don't change cause my loop long
Might slide these on with a shoe on
But when I'm in the spot I'm real easy to spot
Spit it to the side with a suit on
Never been a type of nigga too horn
But boy I'm a big deal no Brewpon
I'm living social, while your bitch emotional
Tell her ease back like a futon
I don't like those
I just pipe those
Never wife those
What the fuck am I talkin' about I never wife none
When a nice gun
That's when I go
Cause there's no such thing as the right one
If you living this life with a light one
Hold that cup over your head
Where me and you from, they call that the slums, by now we supposed to be dead

[Hook]
