[Hook: DJ Paul] 2x
I got mask on face, hand on heat
'Bout to rob my connect cause I know he got them keys
I ain't no crosser, but a nigga gotta eat
I ain't-I ain't no crosser but a nigga gotta eat

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
I be gettin' work from the same dude five sum'n years
Laid back 'bout the years, it's what you do wit' them years
Went through the cheers and tears, my life took a change
As soon as I bought a thing I blew the whole thing
Me, LL and Chris at my crib gettin' pissed
Drunk, drainin', coke to the brain and
Hit the strip club, find a girl that's game and
Back to the pad, put the X in her vein and
We can talk about that a whole 'nother day
But today, a nigga pockets ain't straight
Long story short I done fucked my money off
Straight to the point, I gotta holla at my boss

[Hook: DJ Paul] 2x
I got mask on face, hand on heat
'Bout to rob my connect cause I know he got them keys
I ain't no crosser, but a nigga gotta eat
I ain't-I ain't no crosser but a nigga gotta eat

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
I really don't want to be robbin' this nigga
Remember the times I went hard with this nigga
But now I gotta soft this nigga
Drop this nigga, pop this nigga
We cockin' to make a lil nigga run outta town
To pick up powder, pills and pounds of kush
Not realisin' the shit gon' get took
Never would this nigga play by the book
Narcotics got nigga shook
Snitched on me, but is this good?
Sin took no second look
Nigga didn't make my money, put no money on my books
Now I gotta get up for the stash, dash and pop his hood
Why can't a nigga just keep the shit real
And not be goin' out like a ho?
Then he not become the foe of the Infamous Scarecrow
No I can't just run off wit' his dope and let him go after that
His niggas know my niggas got the automatics with that

[Hook: DJ Paul] 2x
I got mask on face, hand on heat
'Bout to rob my connect cause I know he got them keys
I ain't no crosser, but a nigga gotta eat
I ain't-I ain't no crosser but a nigga gotta eat
