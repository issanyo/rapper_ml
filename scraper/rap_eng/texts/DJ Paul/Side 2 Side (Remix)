[DJ Paul]
Yeah... This a dance song for all my thugs in the club
That don't dance... Just be in the back arms folded..
Cap pulled down, Just on the cut scopin everythang
Know what I'm sayin? Three 6 Mafia, Project Pat, Bow Wow, WHAT!
Its goin down here!

[Chorus: DJ Paul & Bow Wow]
I'm in the club posted up (up), got my arms folded
Blunt in my mouth and these haters I'm scopin
I'm just twistin my body from side 2 side (I'm just)
Twistin my body from side 2 side
I'm in the club posted up (up), got my arms folded
Fitted pulled down and these haters I'm scopin I'm just
Twistin my body from side 2 side (I'm just)
Twistin my body from side 2 side (Yea)

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
See ho I don't dance (dance)
In the city where I'm from I wear the pants (wear the pants)
These bitches think they cool (cool)
I got the dick so I make the rules (make the rules)
I got a big ol cock (big ol cock)
I love a bitch with a big ol bra (big ol bra)
She love suckin up cum (cum)
I think I'mma give her some (some)

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
I pull up in a Lambo, pockets stay on strike
Walk up in the club and ask these hoes what it hit fo
You know I got them stacks on deck
If ye ain't tip-tippin you a lame and that's that
Got the butterfly do's ridin clean on the 'Lac
Wit them Alpine speakers bumpin heavy in the back
I don't know about yall but evrything I do is big
From the rocks in my chain to the cars and the cribs
Nigga, im in the club...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Twistin my body, movin to the muuuusic
Cool lil body, don't you confuuuse it
We can get tooo's it
Hands, I ruuules it
Lil cause got a thang on him, he'll uuuse it
Thats cocked to the right and to the left though
Killas on blow, insane like a kepto
Maniac, Project Pat posted wit my kinfolk
Ridin wit the hood Norf-Norf to the world though

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
I thought you knew I was the mane (mane)
The D-boy off the chain (chain)
Gon walk up to a girl tell a bitch I'm Rick James (James)
Wit the diamonds in my rang (rang)
And gold point fangs (fangs)
And you know I'm hood rich means I got a little change (change)
Wit my thugs from the North cause I know they got my back
Lookin for some chickens that can work it on the track
I'm just tryna get a mill I ain't tryna be a mack
Posted up in the club wit a pocket full of crack

[Chorus]

[DJ Paul]
Get 'Em
