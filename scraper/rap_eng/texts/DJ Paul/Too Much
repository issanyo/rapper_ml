[Chorus: DJ Paul & TWHY]
Smoked up, [?] out, all my homies passed out
Smoked up, [?] out, all my homies passed out
Smoked up, [?] out, all my homies passed out
Smoked up, [?] out, all my homies passed out
Smoked up, [?] out, all my homies passed out
Smoked up, [?] out, all my homies passed out
Smoked up, [?] out, all my homies passed out
Smoked up, [?] out, all my homies passed out
Where my fuckin' smokers at?

[Verse 1: Berner]
I got all this work comin'
Big Bern' grab bags by the hunnids
I brought the cash, yeah, I'm try'na grab somethin'
I'm in the back of the Maybach stuntin'
I'm in the back of the Maybach smokin'
Pretty bitch took a hit, start chokin'
All this shit on my wrist keep glowin'
And the zeros in my bank keep growin'
I got rich but your boy still grimy, baby girl, what's good?
I smoke vibes, I don't roll no woods, I get high
Man, this shit's so good I had to take me a pack
My boy wanted Q.P., just throw me a stack
Grabbed a cookie tray, rolled me a bag
I'm too took with a dab of Pound Cake and a bag of Blue Cook (Blue Cook)
Cracked a forty too, we don't need no chaser
Menu master, king of the flavors
I'mma a O.G. smoker, Bern' been blowin'
I'm still up North with the big plants growin'
Heart keep beatin' like I just did powder
Naw, that's Lemonade, back to the Sour
Yeah, we gave you Cherry Pie, Sherb, and a Cookie
The cops pulled me over but today they ain't book me
I got so high, forgot to pay my bookie
I smoke one more and fell asleep on the pussy

[Chorus: DJ Paul & TWHY]
Smoked up, [?] out, all my homies passed out

[Verse 2: Berner]
I been around, still grindin'
Big Bern, baby, grown, big timin'
Big rocks in my watch still shinin'
Triple seal so the dogs don't find it
Three bags? I'mma need twelve flat
Low cash but it come right back
Smoke hash and my lungs turn black
Fuck rap, I'm in love with the pack
I'm still dirty in the city
What you need? I bet we got it for sure
I'm the man with the shit, I even got an award
I fill the whole bus up when we out on tour
It go quick, so quick, I need more
I bought a block on Melrose, opened a store
They lined up for this shit like I'm droppin' some Jordans
We run California, Texas, and Georgia
I'm on one, I should just setup in Florida
I'm on one, fuck it, New York, I'm coming
Got a spot in Town Square, four-hunnid a onion
I got the lemon in the shortcake, cherry in London
I'm smokin', yokin', rippin', runnin'
I had to roll two joints for the haters that hate
Yeah, I'm winning and they can't relate
No plates on the Wraith
This shit here fresh off the lot
I roll a joint then I send out a box, that's real plug talk

[Chorus: DJ Paul & TWHY]
