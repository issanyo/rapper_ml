Everybody out there supporting the movement!

Let’s Go!
Lemme get a shot at this mane, its my time!

[Verse]
We can do some straight war for war
We can do some sticking and moving
They ask ‘bout Three 6 reunion...
You know what goin’ - Ask Juicy!
We drop an album they gone have to make a thrown for the 6
Way shit goes Raps’ll(??) sample every song off that bitch!

N_____ tried to have DJ but I clear samples twice a day
Three 6 Mafia on Fire; ain’t dropped an album since 08’
I own the masters of my tapes, ain’t gotta rap another day!
And for you N_____ who ain’t clearin’ man you know yo track ain’t safe!
And for you N_____ selling dope, okay, just know your track ain’t safe!
I made this beat back in 2K and you youngins was like 8
I was ridin’ in the Phantom before Phantoms came in Wraiths
Please don’t hate me, hate the banks for stankin’ cheese up I take! Yeah!
Hold that thought, stall and stop! Woah!
Smoke that dope holding car Ohh!
They talk shit on the net but my net worth like Jerry Jones so
All frosty with the drip(???)
McAuley Culkin with ya bitch
Switch up Houses on a Bitch
SwishaHouse with The Flip
Bring em out like a tip
Baked Potato on the tip
No face for a n____
All flavors worth of sip

A lotta rappers wouldn’t of buss, if it wasn’t for me and Lord Infamous...  Ugh!

....AND YOU CAN’T EVEN SAY R.I.P. LORD INFAMOUS!!!

Now it’s 18 years later-and this songs still gettin’ noticed
Children, welcome! Challenge me?!
I won this challenge when I wrote it, n____!

R.I.P. Koopsta Knicca...
