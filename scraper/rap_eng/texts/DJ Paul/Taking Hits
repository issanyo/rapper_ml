You ever seen the 30-30 with the scope on it?
A bunch of niggas smokin weed, that got dope on it
And we don't leave no evidence, or no fingerprints
Follow certain elements, cause niggas go to jail for this
They say I'm heaven sent, I think I'm Hell bound
Cause I'm addicted to the way a twelve gauge Sound

[D-Tay]

If he run, he ain't gettin one, get a three or a fo'r bit
That's for movin, must have been some confusion, when I came in
