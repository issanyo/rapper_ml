Psycho in da

Cut with the mask and the pistol grip
I gotta touch 'em

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
This shit is beginning to come into focus but no one can figure out Infamous murderous, dark psychosis
Trippin I'm running the darkness, I'm loading berettas, I'm jacking yo' ho shit
A posse of satanic mobbers, we coming to smoke 'em and leave 'em in puddles of plasma
I'm coming for stashes, for cash then blast until everyone in here passed out
My fellow man, you cannot comprehend strength of the devil military killers
Execution to death, you will be sentenced as I put Nina into your head through the pillow
The Three 6 nigga coming to injure you at nightfall
Give it up or this desert eagle shall make them fall up on you all
(Come on mayn, you finna give me them ?? nigga)
Naw bitch... (aww dog ???)
Naw bitch... (a couple of hundred mayn)
(Just a couple of hundred mayn a couple hundred) Check it out my nig
I'm gonna kill you any way you won't need none of that shit
Ran through the backyard, jumped the gate to the corner of the back street
Hopped into the steamer, tossed the fuckin' stash behind the seat
I'm coming to rush 'em son, crush 'em son, buck my gun
I'm gonna reach out and touch someone

[Verse 2: Crunchy Black]
I got a problem, money dividends, gotta solve them
The only thing going through my head is murder and rob them
I heard they got cash, I gotta touch they ass
Quick, fast, in a hurry, get away with a fuckin dash
Every night I sit and think on
Why these hoes keep playing with me
They gonna make me click them clicka click
And they don't wanna see my bad side
P. they gonna make me transform to another man
And make they motherfuckin ass do the devil dance
Crunchy Black bitch, coming at you hoes easy come easy go
Easily we kicking doors, I gotta touch 'em

[Verse 3: Koopsta Knicca]
In my fuckin head, I vision bloody red
As I chopped off his fuckin head, left him dead for them bitches
A psycho at large, dumb bitch don't step to this bomber squad
I'm hard and I go and I rip you apart like a prey (?) the predator
No need for them paramedics, see wait for the Koopsta scared 'em
Sc-scared a bitch (?) hectic now waitin' for that armageddon
Bitch

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
I hooked up with a few down niggas from the M-town
Then we started robbin outta town, makin' them lay it down
Touchin' crackers with a 12 gauge to they fuckin' back
Stickin' them liquor stores, robbin banks, plenty car-jacks
Snatchin old ladies purse, knockin niggas to the dirt
My 9 gone make yo body hurt, I'll put your body in a hearse
Call me a playa hater, traitor, what you want bitch
Strapped wit them thangs on your ass, hear them guns click
Inside job, strictly robbin so you better beware
Of the nigga with a gat and mask, raise 'em in the air

[Verse 5: DJ Paul]
Now life was up and down for the Killa Man as a youngster
Stickin these tricks up daily you tripping I'm still a hustler
Cutting class don't make my snooze behind the barrel
Shootin crowds I hit it up in a honeycomb
And smoke a fuckin pamper house
Hollerin at my brother Phil D I gotta get straight
No thang mayn he got me straight
That thang fool be booming weight
Hoppin on my scooter with my ski mask and my Deuce Duece
All blue joggin' suit, tube socks, and Coogi troop
But now I'm getting older, comin' clean is what I'm hopin'
And now that I got boulder dope girls are what I'm scoping bitch
This is the touch...
