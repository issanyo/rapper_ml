[Hook: repeat 4X]
CLICK! Bang bang {*repeat 3X*}
CLICK! Bang bang to yo' motherfuckin brain ho

[Verse One]
I told them haters "Hate on!", and Three 6 Mafia strong
Stronger than ever ever since they've been gone, I've been better
FUCK THEM FAKERS and them tag-along fakers
Smilin in my face but got my enemy on your MySpace
I can't understand how these niggas live with theyself
Deal with theyself, what they need to do is kill theyself
BLAOW! Suicide - that's a good rationale
At your funeral for free, I play the piano
Rest in pieces you niggas sweet like Reese's
Got mo' crosses than churches, heart smaller than a fetus
You need us, you're nuttin, you're zero, you're zip, you're nada
I'm 22 on the Rolls, you the hubcaps on the Impala

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
I'mma creep up on this fool, put this gun to his head
Tell him give me all your jewelry, all your dope, all your bread
All the coke that you brought in, the weed that you brought in
And if I can't get answers, say hello, to my lil' friend
You fakin like you ball and brawl and shotcall
I'm that fool that break jaws and all the state laws
Stupid rappers get your check, buy rims and what's next?
Need to get a place to live, a crib, cause you ain't shit
With your mix-tapes, niggas hate, say they real, but they ain't
Catch them somewhere face to face, then they run from place to place
Club hoppin', mall shoppin', gettin' hot, sales droppin
Now you wanna sober up and tell these niggas you got fucked

[Hook]
