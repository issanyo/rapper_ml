[Verse]
Paul wit' that .45, shoot that bitch up in his guts
Bitch I thought I told you this a motherfuckin' stick 'em up
I'm clickin' like a lunatic cause I'm down with that devil shit
Now can a busta kick it, can uh I kick it bitch?
Like my nigga Skinny
Don't make me turn this to no damn murder
Made the fuckin' stang
To split the brains of them night burglars
Damn my motherfuckin' license, slip the clip into my gat
Oops I think I got them niggas, had to hit the dope track
To make a nigga quick my nig
I slapped him wit' my damn tone
Buck them bitches down, get to clickin' for them herringbones
Jack 'em to my yellow line, leave 'em there for one time
Cause for a petty crime
I swear I'd die before I do some time
If I got you bitches scared
Fuck 'em vultures call the feds
Gon' wind up in the med
Testin' the pimpin' I'm leavin' 'em dead trick
On your monkey ass still, killin' it with some pimp shit
You need to catch up with your fuckin' kind
Cause the anna got me clickin'
