[Intro]
Yeah
Binge 3! ...6!
Just cause it sounds good, man
(C-C-C-C-C)
Let's go

Ever since I can remember, I been
Rockin' my color
Rockin' my color
Rockin' my color
(P to the I to the N to the K) {x4}

(C-C-C-C-C)
Watch me just Jackie Chan stunt on this shit, check

[Verse]
I got so much money, I can buy the world another god
I got so much money, I can try to find a scripture
That God wouldn't mind listenin' to
To remind him that I'm livin' proof that
Listenin' to dude ain't even fishin', is it?
So he slaved me, yet, while I trust him
I never rush, I stay in bed with percussion
Playin' the head of a dungeon, and you're done in
I got so much money I made somethin' buy somethin'
I'm somethin' else, but C will never take a L
Levitatin' well, hell is bakin' well
Celibate to self, cause jail is just for jealous lovers
So in your head I'm smothered, music the bread and butter
And I am never a sucker, I get sucked on
Get up, get gone, or just puff on the chron'
Kiss, touch, quick hug, get a sucker for you
Whatever lollipops traditionally signify
The spittin' bully, fully semi, or just really bright
Simplified, till soldiers get in any time
Minutes with the women, get in the ride, and give 'em mine
Oh yeah, gender time, change it, or sit and recline
Well, none of my women are a five
And for a few months, I was livin' with two guys
One is a player, and the other is a white boy
None of them like boys, so I made the right choice
Like

(C-C-C-C-C-C-H-A-R
H-A-M-I spitting like a semi
Spitting like- spittin'-spittin'-spittin' like a semi)
A yo how much time I got left?
Fuck it

[Verse 2]
I don't know how much time is left on the clock
Accept it or not, I'm better than most
So I just suggest that you watch your watch
Watch the seconds go
And watch how I spit the most reckless flow
Y'all niggas need to eat your breakfast 'fore I slit your throat
You won't be able to digest the message
Even if I left you know that
You ain't even worth the hair on testicles
From a fucking monkey I'm a ex-junkie
And I make ya ex a junkie
When I stick it in her fucking funky monkey
And I be smacking her donkey
I'm an ass though
And I refuse to be categorized as asshole
Cause I'm the shit
Y'all niggas ain't Charmin
Ya mis-pronouncing this shit cause I'm CHARMING
Done!
