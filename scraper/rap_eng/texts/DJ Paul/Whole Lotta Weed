Man let me hit that weed dog
Man that shit some dro
Man that was fucked up what happened to tha boy tha other day
Man u know how these niggas do
Violate real playaz and end up
On the motherfucking front page of the newspaper
Fuck that sucker thats what he gets
For running his motherfucking mouth (bitch)

[Hook 2x]
Real playaz like to smoke a (whole lotta weed)
Drinkin bottles of that liquor (all that we need)
This 9mm (will make you bleed)
I advise you niggas (dont fuck wit me)

[Project Pat]
Real playaz like to smoke a
Stroke her off in her throata
Bend ova let me poke her
Roll up on some old dopea
Dont take me fo a joka
Hollows will make ya croaka
My hands around your throata
Grip grip tight like a choka'
Hate hate me fo no reason
Beat beat yo like a peon
Pumpkin head whatchu getta
It must be killin season
For some droppas and suckas
Coward ass mothufuckas
Poppin off at that cappa
Could get you killed like othas
Maybe its not yo time
Maybe it could be mine
Then put me in a box and bury me wit my nine-a
Forty-Fo and my shotty
Hatas up in this sorry
Wishin they put tha bullets up in my body
But thats if im a gonna
For now smell the aroma
Of brown cold liquor and potent marijuana
Project Pat in this bitcha
Tryin mayne to get richa
The first hit off this dope is gonna hit cha

[Hook 2X]

Stay down about cho gama
Fame-a I never claim-a
A monkey's on my facea
For those who are a stranga
Strange cause I do not know ya
Chip chip on yo shoulda
Im knockin out yo teeths
Fists hard just like a boulder
I'm creepin in the Nova
Somewhere out in Cordova
A nigga done got bolder
His life is gon be ova
Grey tape with clip banana
I kidnap I can handle
He came to me with Anna
He should of mind his manners
I hit him with the Tec-a
Damn near tore off his necka
He prayin I'm gon squash him
He shoulda prayed to Mecca
You hataz like to tick me
Squeeze triggaz till im empty
This weed turned me out
I damn near let it bit me
I'm stealin to get higher
Smokin nothin but that fire
(Damn that was my last blunt dog)
Nigga you's a liar
So cuz you tryin to screw me
I told them man don't do me
I'm drinkin on that brewsky
This shit is goin through me

Whole lotta whole lotta whole lotta..........
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

Out the pen once again
It's yo dog stackin ends
Makin cheese fuckin hoes
Knockin ducks off they toes
Up the nose
Goes the white
Pimpin hoes take a flight
Like a kite like a plane
My nigga im the man
Mista dont take no shit
Mista well take yo bitch
Ten toes bout the biz
Cowards can not handle these
Scandalous paradnoid
Bout to bust on my boys
Check niggas fo they grip
Pistols swing busted lip
Busted chops that's yo ass
Punk bitch wheres the cash
Money green cheddar cheese
All bitches hit they knees
Serve em up ready rock
Distribute it on the track
Always keep me a Glock
Place it up to your back
Fat sacks your smokin on
Mack man wit a tone
P-A-T bout the lout
Ridin by then I shoot
Who's to say cheefin hay
Hustlin to get pay
Round the clock
Round the way
Gettin mines every day
