[Intro]
Yo, I usually don't do this
But you know what I'm saying
Had to come body bag this one time

[Verse 1]
Niggas really thought I was in jail or something
Momma didn't raise no hoe or something
I was really in the store bought a Snickers or something
I was trapping in in the way back and I got that
And I flip that and I really get that
But I told my mom "I don't do that!"
But she was really there
And I told her that "Yeah, I'm coming in,"
But she was like, "Nah, don't come near"
And I was like, "GED"
And I said, "I flip that, really get that"
I whip that and I hit that and I-yeah
LA see you next week, Coachella I'm here today
But fuck that we here and we live wit' TR3YWAY
Fuck that, umm
Cut it
