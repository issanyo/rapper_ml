[Intro: David Banner]
It's ya boy David Banner
I'mma see if I can bring the gangster walk back
Memphis, Mississippi!
Everybody from the south, let's ride!

[Chorus: David Banner]
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
We representing Memphis, 'Sippi
And I don't think you really wanna get with me
We started gangsta walking, nigga, not no MC Hammer
This the really-dilly, get you hyper than hype, no cut, or no Arm & Hammer
Slam a hater to the floor, stomp a mud hole in that ho
Mean as hell on that liquor, meaner than that on that blow
So don't push me muthafucka, push me muthafucka, push
I'm affiliated with more terrorists than G Bush

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
We got them niggas getting wild, getting buck, having fits
With a bottle in they hand, with a blunt to they lips
Gangsta walking in the club, everybody gonna [blitz?]
And them hoes on the corner working graveyard shifts
Yeah they call me the Juice, from that north north set
Where they rob for the gross and they divvy up the net
Ain't no talking, fuck some talking, we gonna shoot them in the chest
If a coward wanna jump, it's gonna be a bloody mess

[Chorus: David Banner]
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!

[Verse 3: Marcus]
Now we can get it buck in the club, with niggas I suggest you tuck your chain
Fuck security, find out they can't do a thing
Out the frame, pussy nigga you too soft, push you off me
Stomping hoes to the floor and never scared to pop heat
Anna on your bird chest, better not talk no shit tonight
'Cuz ain't no thing to bust your head and start a fight
Like bitch, what's up now?

[Verse 4: David Banner]
North Mississippi in this bastard
Fuck around, my nizzle, and get your whole body plastered
All up on the wall, trick, if you got some manner
Gangsta walk your ass over here bumping the Banner
It'll be fabulous if you leave
'cuz I'm trying to stomp your body 'til your ass can't breathe

[Chorus: David Banner]
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!

[Verse 5: 8Ball & MJG]
Left foot, right foot, swinging both of your fists
Better keep it moving, your weak ass might get hit
Get stomped out when you buck back, too hard
Get ready to finish anything that you start
Straight from the mound, boys better not clown
I got eight-five niggas with me representing the town
Two-hundred automatic Uzis with them Tommy-gun clips
Make you boys take them paper-cap poppers off your hips
Young pimp, smoke week, don't snort, might sip
Four-fifth with a bunch of holotips in the whip
I'm pimp-tight, MJG, you can look at my resume
Never been a trick, never ever paid

[Chorus: David Banner]
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Go on ganster walk, go on do it, muthafucka!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
Buck jump, muthafucka, buck jump, ya bitch!
