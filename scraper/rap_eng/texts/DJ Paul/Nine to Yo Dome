[Verse 1]
The motherfuckin south is in the house foe the nine-fo
Memphis niggas, nigga and we killas who gon run the floor
One of you hoes step
One of you hoes gonna die bitch
Ain't no thang
Simple and plain bang
In your eye bitch
Tricky type ass niggas
Always wanna flex they nuts
But they gonna get fucked
With this nine
Stuck up they butt
Unload this whole damn clip up in your ass ho
Naw, its to late to squash the shit
I'm gonna blast ho
Fuck the five O
And the motherfuckin jumpin grass
Searching a real nigga in his draws
Like they ass a fag
Get yo god damn hands off of a real one
Just before I make you feel the bullets from my steel, some
Big ass cop think I'm playin
But I'm from tha hood
North Memphis ho
Yeah rank it bitch Hollywood
Ready and prepared
That's the execution with my tone
Whatcha gonna do when my nine chrome's at your dome
Bitches

[Hook: Buckshotz]
Nine to your dome ho whatcha gonna do bitch
Nine to your dome whatcha whatcha gona do bitch
Nine to your dome ho whatcha gonna do bitch

Nine to your dome ho whatcha gonna do bitch
Nine to your dome whatcha whatcha gona do bitch
Nine to your dome ho whatcha gonna do bitch
Nine to your dome whatcha whatcha gona do bitch

[Verse 2]
Nine motherfuckin millimeter ain't no tradin ho
This some real shit, street shit, lettin' suckers know
If yo ass step, go ahead, make me pull the trigger
Fuckin with me dawg
You gonna make me catch a charge nigga
Figure out a way with these hollow points, copper tips
Slip, trip, cock back, quick then I shoot a bitch
Ain't no damn fuckin around
13 rounds at your head
Aim point blank at your face
Makin sure you're dead
Headed to my motherfuckin ride, ditchin evidence
Mask on, Locc's on, headed to my residence
Consequences; they occur when you talkin' smack
Thinkin' you the big man, but you better watch your back
Rat tat tat tat
With the sound of the tech nine
Take this trick bitch ass nigga tryin to take mine
(Oh naw man I ain't gonna take yours)
(Ain't nothing like that dog you know what I'm sayin)
Nine to yo fuckin dome bitch

[Hook: Buckshotz]
Nine to your dome ho whatcha gonna do bitch
Nine to your dome whatcha whatcha gonna do bitch
Nine to your dome ho whatcha gonna do bitch
Nine to your dome whatcha whatcha gonna do bitch
Nine to your dome ho whatcha gonna do bitch
Nine to your dome whatcha whatcha gonna do bitch
Nine to your dome ho whatcha gonna do bitch
Nine to your dome whatcha whatcha gonna do bitch
