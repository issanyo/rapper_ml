[Intro: DJ Paul] 4x

I can go wherever I want
And I can get whatever I need

Cause nigga I'm a hundid thou wow on these streets
I can go wherever I want
And I can get whatever I need
World wide hoods recognize me
Cause nigga I'm a hundid thou wow on these streets

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
The streets fuck with me cause I feed 'em
Real street nigga for real, I got that freedom
Got a pass in all hoods cause it's all good
From Memphis Tn to fuckin' Berlin, we got it understood
Real recognize real, snitch niggas get killed
In the city where I live; Black Haven Zone
Fake niggas don't want it, fake niggas don't kill
... hoe nigga that's on the real

[Verse 2: La Chat]
I'm a major bitch, I'm in these streets takin' loco
Do whatever I want, these niggas (?) keep smokin' good dope
Bitches out here fuckin' for the free, hoe that's a no-no
Niggas can't say shit out here to me without them pesos
I'ma keep it real, keep it trill, I'm a hundid
I'm ridin' with that steel, gold grill, gettin' money
And I can go wherever, they got nothin' but love for me
Hoe I been at the blocks, put it down in these streets

[Verse 3: Koopsta Knicca]
Twenty years totin' steel, Memphis where I roam at
Koopsta cap peeler hoe, turn the hood pitch black
Vice Lord, GD, Crips, Bloods know me
Koop keepin' big heat, they be admirin' me
Tennessee where I'll die (I'll die)
Triple 6 nigga for life (for life)
Money make me smile, when I see it I want it hoe
Rappin', breakin' bitches, robbin' niggas even cut throat
Did you hear the news? They repeated what I said loc
"I'll come back and kill all y'all hoes!"
And I ain't gotta look up to stars (just stars)
Cause I ain't gotta dream no more (no more) BITCH

[Hook: Billy Wes]

[Verse 4: Crunchy Black]
I used to be a motherfuckin' stick-up kid
You wouldn't believe some of the shit I did
Like set a nigga up to feed my kids
Or set a nigga up and get that bill
Ain't nothin' goin' on but the money in this bitch
I stick ya, stick and move, that's how I do it
I'm breakin' the law, yes I'm breakin' the law
If you talkin' that shit then I'm breakin' ya jaw, ya jaw
I can do whatever I want and I can go wherever I plead
And if I catch you talkin' 'bout me
But when I pull the heat, then nigga that's beef

[Hook: Billy Wes]
I can go wherever I want
And I can get whatever I need
And I can be whatever I be
Cause nigga I'm a hundid thou wow on these streets
I can go wherever I want
And I can get whatever I need
World wide hoods recognize me
Cause nigga I'm a hundid thou wow on these streets
