(Chorus)
I always have fun in washington(washington)
Dancin from the evening till the moning sun (oww)
It's your northwest partner ( eyy) afroman (afroman)

Angela from washington washed my dick and balls with her tonge
She liked to wallawalla in wallawalla first i make her holler then i make her swalla
I got jane from shpokeain hoked on my dick like rock-cocain

Sleepless i seatale wake 'n bake take my rattle snake
Flylin' in your pussy like a sea hawk
I grab you by the sholders then i hit the sea walk uhhhggggg

Pulled out my dick and got some brain i had'
A rich girl in kettel falls liking on my ghetto balls
Met a fat girl in kinnywit pullee out my long black skinny dick
Fine lady cop from ukiema she had the coffe i had the cream'a

Took a ride to the sunny side to the money and ride fro daddy thats rigth
Prosses a girl in the city of prosses kind'a found out she's a salad tosser (slurpping sound)

All the way to co-fax bummpin' cold track making cold stacks
