[Verse 1: Lil Fly]
Hizzo don't you knizzo that the ana got me fucking clicking
Keep that shizits to yourself, hizzo you just testing pimping
When you testing pimping hoe you limping towards your fucking death
Hizzit in your grave full of rage with your bad self
Make my pimping just a little bigger bustas can't compare
Smoke them lemons like some mega blunts, put 'em in the izzi
Put them busta sucks in the wind Mr. Ibn
Dwelling with the lunatic, Flizzi has no fucking friends
Friends that turn they back, cause they ana turn them fucking green
Green with envy, jealous bitches tryna kick it on fly scene
But them lemons claim they got your back, lay it dizzown Jack
Flizzick with some trill niggas, buck them niggas on Lil's sack

Strapping in the nino five, chilling in the nino quad

Crown in half make me laugh have you like Fly 80 rounds
