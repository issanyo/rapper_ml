[Intro]
She's the giggle-she's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's-knows everybody's disapproval
She's the giggle-she's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's-knows everybody's disapproval
She's the giggle-she's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's-knows everybody's disapproval
"We were born sick,"-"We were born sick"
You heard them say-you heard them say it

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Head so good I thought I need the broad
I just need the draws
She was on me so tight, I couldn't breath at all
We could see the flaws
But with a bad bitch we ain't really trippin'
No we wouldn't even be involved
And she a genius, nah
But niggas fuck up and let the penis talk
Give her the keys and all
You let her keep your car, you let her keep your card
She let the visa talk, she done keyed your car
I be scared of this, I be careful cause
In two days this bitch talkin' marriage
Show up at work, this bitch is a terrorist
We not stingy my nigga, share a bitch
Unprepared for this then that bitch we lovin'
Dangit this bitch needs a therapist
Got grey hairs and whip from a pair of tits
Got these niggas all in your residence
So sucker ass nigga
You the type of nigga that my bitches'll decline
You the type of nigga try to make a bitch jealous
And me, I get mad when she don't hunt a nigga down
Type of shit is that?
Type of nigga that'll fall for a rat
We stay away from ones like that my nigga
You ain't gotta do all that
Say ones that be frontin', we the ones callin' right back (back)

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Get the fuck away, get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me ho
Get the fuck away, get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me ho
Get the fuck away, get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me ho
(I'm just wonderin' why did I fuck that bitch anyway)
Get the fuck away, get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me ho
(What I should have do was run away, run away)
Get the fuck away, get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me ho

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
She got a very good tone
Mother must have been a funeral director cause she killin'
Takin' the shovel out and diggin' pot holes with these hot hoes
Leather pants get tight
Booty feelin' on my collar of my good phone
I never bother her to come home
Homie let 'em run around
I got a couple runnin' around
I give a fuck about a love song
Anymore
I've packin' like a person hit the floor
Back up in the feelin off tour, boy
Bitch I'm unplugged, no cord
Takin' out the trash, chores, chores
I got style that you can't afford
Can't buy so you wanna try, cry my Lord
Gettin' beat up in the seat of a Chevy heater
But winners better believe it cause I drive no Ford
Never mind your boy, friends
This Benz and these ends is a fuckin' toy
I took your hotty out your Maserati
Fuck her in a port-a-potty
Flowin' out the crap in the joint
I'm a born savage
I try to be a good boy but I can't manage
Damn it
I just want a palm, panties and some arm candy
From all over the planet, planet rock

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Get the fuck away, get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me ho
Get the fuck away, get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me ho
Get the fuck away, get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me ho
(I'm just wonderin' why did I fuck that bitch anyway)
Get the fuck away, get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me ho
(What I should have do was run away, run away)
Get the fuck away, get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me ho

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
She got that super good goodie
Pussy bout nice then I beat 'em
Quicker, bigger shoulda build a nigga, wouldn't need her
She put your ass down soon as you first meet her
For real, for real
A nigga had to go pop that blue pill
Cause that pussy got dat ass killed for real
The booty, the ass, that shit mass appeal
But that booty gettin' niggas killed for real
But I'ma back off of that back up
While I hit the dollar full of handcuffs
She the key to rose
And had to burn alone
And should unload on that dumb ho
But damn damn, straight no-no
Should have never even fuck that ho
On God

[Bridge]
I'm just wonderin' why did I fuck that bitch anyway
Anyway, anyway, anyway, any
When I shoulda did is run away
Run away, run away, run away

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Get the fuck away, get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me ho
Get the fuck away, get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me ho
Get the fuck away, get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me ho
(I'm just wonderin' why did I fuck that bitch anyway)
Get the fuck away, get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me ho
(What I should have do was run away, run away)
Get the fuck away, get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me ho
