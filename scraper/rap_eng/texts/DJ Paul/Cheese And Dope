[Verse 1]
Out here slanging on this blade prayin that I don't get cut
By these police making raids, jumping out and checking nuts
Cutting balls down to crumbs, babbage weed is in my lungs
Nigga stick me for a bag, I'mma shoot him in his ass
I'mma show 'em who the boss, when you niggas gonna learn
When you cross in this game, then yo ass will get burned
Wait my turn, or my time rock for rock, for the dime
Takin' Fed chance after chance, but I got to dance
To the rules of this shit, that's why I keep a revolver
How the hell you robbers gonna rob the robber?
Boy I'm gonna scald ya with pistol slapped cross mouth
Reachin in ya pockets, and take yo money out
Mane you now whats goin'~ you got cheese, I got dope
For da 900th strong, I got p'z, I got coke
Ain't no credit givin' mayne you could get from round here
Niggas robbing, niggas banging, niggas slangin' down here

[Hook]

I got cheeeese, hoez, and a bunch of fucking dope
I got p'z, coke, and some killaz at tha do'
Hydro weeeeeed smoke, and a quarter ounce of blow
What you neeeeeeed bro, is to fuck wit yo boy

[Verse 2]
Quarter bird what's the word? For you dog, it's da low
Sellin me babbage weed but you want the purest snow
I'ma go, I'mma pull, me a rabbit out a hat
Ounce of cane mixed with sugar and some killaz strapped wit gats
Always trying to be slick, you done stepped in some shit
You done broke ghetto laws, you done tore ya fuckin drawes
Wit me boy, yeain't know, cause the streets never lies
Walk right up on yo ass, shoot right between the eyes
You be stankin' wit the flies
Ridin on chrome, wit yo bitch, smokin' dro
Fucking all in yo home, while ya kissing on her lips
She be sucking on my dick, flip and flop, on the paint, system booms as I dip
Through the streets of da hood, north memphis hollywood
Represent it, to da max
I'm just out here stating facts
Trying to stack me some pape's, got my foot on you snakes
I'm gon squeeze off some lead for you niggas that are fake

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3]
You could duck from the tech, out tha Escalade (caddilac)
Once I get my cheese on a roll, then I must get paid
If you want to come against me dawg, bring your whole brigade
But you shall get sliced, like a throat, with a swisher blade
Sippin' on some Paul A. Mousson, like some sweet kool-aid
Strapped with me, an automatic gun, don't you violate
Nigga said he'll snitch on me dawg, I didn't hesitate
Caught him, in the projects one day, sent him to his grave
Playaz wanna come through the hood, but forgot the fear
Knowing it ain't all to the good, you could get it here
Wrong place, at the wrong time, calling "sip" let's go
Dope fiends keep me on the map and my pockets swole
Eyes red as hell, cuz I ain't had a lick of sleep
Snorted a quarter ball, so that I, could stay on my feet
Treat any bitch, just as same as a nigga too
If you trusting hoes in this game, you'se a dammn fool

[Hook till end]
