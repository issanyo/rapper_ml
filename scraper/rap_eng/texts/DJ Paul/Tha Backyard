[Homicide]
Red rum on my mind, and my system full of chronic
Check on the lap and the redbull in my stomach
Wild wild Westwood, niggas love to ride
Weedie, John, Vito, we go, back to the hood Westwood I said
Whenever I got static get the A-K with the infrared
I'm makin' hoes drop like a sniper
Bitches talkin' shit I won't hesitate to strike her, Down
Actin' like a psycho from that buddah
Homicide's a killa because Homicide's a shoota
N-I-Double G-A number 9 is a killa
Bruno with the C-T-O and thats on the forilla
Niggas dyin' 9 mm shells are flyin'
Through a niggas dome, now the morgue is there home
Blown away by A the K, 47 reason 50 shells I can spray
Ay Homicide ain't got no static
Nigga 9 never havin' no problem
Pollute got the 4-5 automatic
For the bitches always tryin' to come hard son
This is the backyard

[Nigga 9]
Ay let Nigga 9 on this motherfucker
S-T-H-M-E-M; where I come from
Time for some action, one for all, all for one
The back yard thicker than a constipated pigeon
Droppin' bombs like eggs from a chicken
I know a girl named Nina, black cougar, got 17 kids last name Lou
Pollute in the house, can you dig it?
Droppin' marks of like Baridi
A drive a-by comin from I kick ya head fuckin loose
From my so notty notty notty notty dreads
Long Duece, South Park, Westwood trigga lota dead
You thicker than this shit, I can't tell
Gangsta Black'll whoop that bitch
Flipin n whoopin n scrapin n dumpin motherfuckers in the ditch, Chyea
It don't get no deeper, you gettin weaker
Put up your guard, this is the backyard

[Juicy J]
Mothafuckin shit don't stop
Gangsta Blac drop this shit

[Gangsta Blac]
I'm totally insane
I'm loosin' my fuckin mind
My eyes are gettin bigger, I think that I'm goin blind
The dope is in my veins, my mind it just can't hang
I'm loosin' my way of speach, I'm talkin' alot of slang
I slip off all in a daze my thoughts they back track
My theory is gangsta kill while sippin' on Similac
I'm loosin a lot of a weight, a drug addict no I ain't
My momma she died clean, my father I have to thank
I'm raised up a bastard child, and that's why I'm hostile
The patience I have none, a menace since ?
Created a gangsta see, now Memphis don't want me
Eventual criminal, I'm fightin' my enemy
My cap is to the side, a war is bout to start
A gangsta gets in the house, I'm flexin' with backyard

[Juicy J]
Goddamn we gunna take a trip to Black Haven
Killaman drop that shit

[D.J. Paul]
It's the motherfuckin back yard crew ho
1234 hundred motherfukers at your door
You gotta go ain't a mothafuckin thang changed
Still kickin my hat to the right
But some little gang niggas wanna fight
But back to the subject of the other ho
I got em switched you play me ruthless
I can't tell bitch
The shit is too mothafuckin thick
The backyard is too mothafuckin hard
