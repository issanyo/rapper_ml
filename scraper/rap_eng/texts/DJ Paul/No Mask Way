[Intro: Locodunit]
No face, no case, fuck who lookin'
I come bare face, closed case cause he pussy
No face, no case, fuck who lookin'
I come bare face, closed case cause he pussy
No face, no case, fuck who lookin'
I come bare face, closed case cause he pussy
Take that L, I know you won't tell, I know you won't tell
I be back next week to get another couple bails

[Verse 1: Locodunit]
I can tell that bitch want some of that
(?) monkey, send some buckshots at yo monkey head
We shootin' with the Killa Cam like a Diplomat
And I swear hoe you won't breathe again like (?), facts
Go get the mac out the trunk of the Lac
... somebody
(?) with an (?) cause I am higher than a tolerance
(?) invited (?) come uninvited with a robbery
(?) like a glossary, mary and coke that's a luxury
Also your outside your inside (?)
Bitch ain't no shots in da air, we don't shoot the breeze
Brea-breakin' down a key, (?) away your profity
(?) with no (?) like a (?)
I say nigga we don't play unless we play for keeps
Loco D, Loco D, I keep them (?)
(?) nigga talkin' sideways like (?)
(?) they turnin' on me like (?)
Fuck 'em, stick 'em in the eye with a (?) stick
Smokin' and roll up gelato with new op
I can't deny it, deny it like 2pac
Drink one on 2pac, drop off your new blocks
Better not pay, I got interest like Reeboks

[Hook]
He a pussy nigga, rob him with no mask on
With no mask on, rob him with no mask on
He a pussy nigga, rob him with no mask on
With no mask on, rob him with no mask on
Kill him with no mask on, with no mask on
Kill him with no mask on, with no mask on
Kill him with no mask on, with no mask on
Kill him with no mask on, rob him with no mask on

[Verse 2: Lil Infamous]
Welcome to the jungle, let me show you how we eat
I pick the pray, you pick a day we lay low on the creep
Here's the food chain: robbers to the highest peak
See them bustas with the bricks and pounds who lie beneath
Mark of the beast, feast on each (?) then nobody eats
I'm fiendin' for keys, G's, easily (?), I got needs
Please don't, move my trigger fingers (?)
(?) capture like cameras my magazine
As I unload ammo the fire glows so where the dope?
You trapped up and we ain't get nothin' that we will smoke
That's my money you get from all of you junkies, cough this shit up and I owe you a hunnid
Movin' the slugs, away with the drugs, tell where the place or stay of yo plug
Hate to place nickle plated in ya mug but customers pay a good range for a buzz
(?) price on the ice, that will suffice, bitch I ain't asking ya twice
Tell what money quicker than a lick, cut out the middle man, split with his bricks
(?) with the click, (?) his click, we got the mask, I'm used to this shit

[Hook]
He a pussy nigga, rob him with no mask on
With no mask on, rob him with no mask on
He a pussy nigga, rob him with no mask on
With no mask on, rob him with no mask on
Kill him with no mask on, with no mask on
Kill him with no mask on, with no mask on
Kill him with no mask on, with no mask on
Kill him with no mask on, rob him with no mask on
