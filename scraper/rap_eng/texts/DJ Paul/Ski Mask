Hook:(rpt.2x)
Ski ski mask over my skull
Papers in my mouth cause I'm real
Bitch it's a house call
Glock nine wit no love
Killaz from the south gotta bill
Caps that make the shells fall

[verse 1: project pat]
Yeah as you walk in the vally of a yuppa
Nigga betta watch your mufuckin zippa
Don't step in shit that you can't handle
Walkin in the dark man, so you need a candle can yo
Ass pay off what chu was runnin
Wanna sell weed but chu stay gettin blunted
Cross head cutters from the hood
Now you don't want it
Just like a man to the deer
You the hunted
When they catch you
You prepare for the slaughta
Don't be surprised you done stepped in they're quater
Kick in your door, put the gun to your daughta
Bizness is shit like seal but it poppa
Reachin for your shit
All you had was a glocka
Mad madness on yea dogg, mufuckin choppa
Ski mask on they're face wit uh banana
Ready man to take care of all this damn, anda

Cliental I done delt
Those who crossed in a ditch

Bullets spray
When I kill I'm the word
Get a piece of the pie
Off a crum or a bird

And your fam-I-ly too

And you know how I do
Taken me for a fool
