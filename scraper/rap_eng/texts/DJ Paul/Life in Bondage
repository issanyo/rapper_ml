[Verse 1: Koopsta Knicca]
My mind is not unwritten, I'm that dreamin' out the window
(?) father please don't hurt my mother, torture, murder
I heard about this story of this lady's bound in bed
Oh Lord I'm just a kid inside my head, I meditate in a cell
Won't you come on in, let 'em die tonight
Tonight I know it (?) some (?)
But she (?) 'bout that million (?)
And man why I be constantly one of that (?)
And that's not last ... mother ...
(?) out to bedroom (?) so many bruise
(?) 5-0 ... gets my favorite shoes
(?) when my oldest brother (?) my draws
Cracks in the walls when we walk the family (?)
So tell me what's gon' happen next, they say I'm stressed
Puttin' tape across my chest is just a process of a lunatic
Called up, wait up, hold up, I'm tired of runnin'
Nigga I'm young, man something's wrong
Her life in bondage got me wonderin'

[Hook]
Come on in, let me take you on a ride

[Verse 2: Koopsta Knicca]
(?) ain't no (?) please excuse me for my (?)
But some wrong with this (?) gettin' thick ...
Hearin' stepdad pimpin' ... mean it
But what about his kids, it was always
(?) he was seein' that Jesus
Come in, come in, come in, want to give the attest
So Lord you got the paranoid so now I'm wonderin'
Should have called the feds
There goes another nigga file ahead
Reminiscin' on a (?) that he said
Now my mom finna go to the med yeah
Sweatin' by the minute, by the sec-sec-sec
I'm stressless sweatin'
Knowin' that she's in critical condition, things can (?)
Protect my mom, please prote-e-ect my mo-o-other
Cause Koop don't wanna go and live in the g-g-gutter
My little sister, little brother; so little they know
Look how I'ma tell 'em that their love is never comin' home?
I'm alone and they what's wrong with us
Mother walk right through the door
The Koopsta could die (?)
