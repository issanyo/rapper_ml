Play a little game, we'll play the hand slap game
One man leaves the circle
I miss you get a shot you miss I get a shot
Here we go, who's the big balls?
I'm ready
Okay

You a man right?
Here we go man
Put your hands up, put your hands up

I'll play your game, if you play my game

You a man right?
Here we go man
Put your hands up, put your hands up [3x]

Play a little game, we'll play the hand slap game
One man leaves the circle
I miss you get a shot you miss I get a shot
Here we go, who's the big balls?
