[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
The Indo's creating illusions
The substance infesting my brain cell is causing confusion
I picture teflon in slow motion, it's piercing through flesh and continues to cruising
Wait - think straight, don't haste, paste penetrate
Face ace sake place base, damn I think I'm crazed
Terror's the era, no errors within my terror
Are you scared of the 6, double 6 demonically elegant elements?
A manic-depressive aggressiveness, stress me bitch
And you will feel the strength of my weapons kit
Tric-kory, hic-kory, dickory dock, I smoke top notch bud crop
Drop the D, the O, the P, the E, I need the B, the L, the U-N-T
Because that green power flower got much love
I tell you don't fuck with the Triple 6 mane
Cause you know that we on them drugs
Damn I'm going off with this blunt outer space rock
Lord Infamous, I keep clouds of smoke flyin' out my mouth

[Hook: Gangsta Blac]
Triple six, triple six, triple six
Smoked out
Now I'm high really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Triple six, triple six, triple six
Smoked out
Now I'm high really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Triple six, triple six, triple six
Smoked out
Now I'm high really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Triple six, triple six, triple six
Smoked out
Now I'm high really high, mane, I'm about to shout

[Verse 2: Playa Fly]
Now I'm sittin' at the crib with a blunt up in my fuckin' hand
Dreamin' of another funk, thinkin' of a master plan
Take the ticker in my hand, squeeze it quickly as Fly can
Crazy as the Gangsta B. all Fly see is blood, man
Now I'm forced to sweat the track because I'm down to make some ends
But Fly prefer the easy route by makin' bustas check it in
Give me some, give me some, hand it here you selfish pig
If your ass wasn't so greedy then you still would breathe my nigga
Fly is headin' to the home, finished up my serve-on
Cause Lil Fly just made a stang, I take you to your stash John
Creepin' through the fuckin' dark, rollin' deep with South Park
Funked out, loced out, you know a Playa won't be barred
When I'm 'bout my haul kill I'm evil as Fly (?) grin
Lil Ibn down to make some ends, bitches gotta check it in
And for you jealous punk ass bitch all up on the Ibn nuts
Fuck them folks, fuck yo folks cause Lil Fly just don't give a fuck

[Playa Fly talking]
Yeah South Park in this bitch
Lil Fly and Gangsta B. in the house for the '94, '95 hoe

[Verse 3: Koopsta Knicca]
Who's that busting up in my door, was way too slow, I hit the floor
They shot up all my niggas in the kitchen flippin' Dominos
Blood all on my leg, I wiped that shit up to my fucking head
Caught them trizzicks slipping, buck them busta bitches dead
Peace out to my niggas Tim and Killa, they're my roadies
My mama said there be days like this but my daddy never told me
And that's why I'm a hard lead, twisting on my dreads
I'm scared, a nigga dead, it's in my fuckin' head
Thinking I would hesitate and wait to buck you bitches down
Read up on my deeds nig, cause I ain't no damn hologram
But I'm clicking with that quickness, like a sickness from the Triple 6
Drop you within a splendour, cut you up like Jeffrey Dahmer bitch
Really I could care less 'bout a nigga tryin' to flex against
The mothafuckin' Tech, you get some *shots* up in your neck
And when see you the Koopsta Knicca, it's a fucking redruM
Run, run, run 'fore I leave ya damn body numb

[Outro: Koopsta Knicca talking]
Yeah it's Koopsta Knicca in this motherfucker
I like to send this shit out to my motherfuckin' niggas
I'm kickin' with over in that North Memphis, South Memphis
And to all my motherfuckin' I kick it with
And North Side, the real motherfuckers
