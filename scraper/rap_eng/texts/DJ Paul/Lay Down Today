[Intro: DJ Paul]
I don't buy dope nigga I rob, nigga I rob

[Hook: DJ Paul]
I'mma make a nigga lay down today
Make his head drop off a few pounds today
I feel like lettin' off a few rounds today
So nigga play if you wanna I got tha 'K

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
I said this year is my come up
Y'all niggas look dumbstruck
You tied up, you cried up
Try to scream but you mummed up
Put the pistol to your fuckin' head
Point at yo head, where da dope at?
Even tho I know your ass stash
You're about to pass yo real bag
You still in that game, still puttin' in work
That's why the bullets I'm about to put in yo head gon' hurt
And I'm walkin' out with the bags
Yall niggas gon get carried out bags
Straight to the motherfuckin' funeral
Yall ridin' past the man
Better listen to what I say cuz the next lay gon' get worse
Better bring alotta coffins, better bring allotta black hearses
Come get that work, cause these niggas were snitchin'
.90 got me a mag, goons I had handlin' business

[Hook: DJ Paul] 2x
I'mma make a nigga lay down today
Make his head drop off a few pounds today
I feel like lettin' off a few rounds today
So nigga play if you wanna I got tha 'K

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Soze BLAY!
Yeah I'mma have to body this butter boy
All snitches must be destroyed
Throw across a holocaust, throw 'em in the fucking void
Eliminate decepticons
Hollow fragments in his lungs
Burst some muscle tissue, laser pistols - Scarecrow Voltron
Characters unwelcomed
Blow 'em out the hemisphere
Tat another tattoo tear
Cut yo throat from ear to ear
Tat you like hydraulic pumps
Pop your body 'till it's slumped
Take you then I strech you out
They won't find ya punkass from mars

[Hook: DJ Paul] 2x
I'mma make a nigga lay down today
Make his head drop off a few pounds today
I feel like lettin' off a few rounds today
So nigga play if you wanna I got tha 'K
