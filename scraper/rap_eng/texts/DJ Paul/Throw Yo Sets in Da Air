[Hook: Three 6 Mafia]
If you niggas ain't scared, throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air, throw yo setts in da air
If you niggas ain't scared, throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air, throw yo setts in da air
Cause we some killa ass niggas
And we don't give a fuck
We come to break the fuckin laws
And tear the fuckin club up
Cause we some killa ass niggas
And we don't give a fuck
We come to break the fuckin laws
And tear the fuckin club up

[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
I think I finally have located the gates of hell
Lie awake at night, to hatch my evil plots, I find myself
Stumblin through the dark, up against the fuckin verge of sin
Bodies in my yard, oh my god them demons came again
People don't you worry cause the Devil's Daughter got a plan
Ho, eternal burning you will have if you don't comprehend
Understand this shit a gansta bitch is sayin to ya dawg
Lock you in the trunk, mob through the night within the mist of fog
Never fear a nigga callin himself a killa, what's up bitch
Boy you claim you so goddam buck wild with that weak ass shit
Chillin at the hideout, smokin' out, not worried bout a thang
Ballin through Black Haven, deep as hell in that suburban mane
Always watchin my back cause niggas will jack you for your fuckin shit
Female I am, but don't give a damn if I split some busta bitch's wig
Three 6 Mafia niggas includin one female that's bumpin so hard on you hoes
The only ones talkin that shit is these jealous ass niggas and all playa hatas you know

[Hook: Three 6 Mafia]
If you niggas ain't scared, throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air, throw yo setts in da air
If you niggas ain't scared, throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air, throw yo setts in da air
Cause we some killa ass niggas
And we don't give a fuck
We come to break the fuckin laws
And tear the fuckin club up
Cause we some killa ass niggas
And we don't give a fuck
We come to break the fuckin laws
And tear the fuckin club up

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Comin from the darkness of the cut of North Memphis bitch
Killas from the evergreen gardens, we don't set trip
For my niggas doin time in 201 for the crime
Let's get in the gangsta line and throw the Funkytown sign
I'm on that other level, a coffin and a shovel
?Fly? down to put yo ass, before you meet the Devil, the metal
Penalties I pay by punk ass opponents, I practice pain
Juiceman no gain, but I slang that thang that keep ???

[Verse 3: D.J. Paul]
I'm steady scopin out these nothins, that be actin like a bitch
That be actin like a ho
That be actin like a muthafucka busta
That wants no more of the 3-6 Mafia, trizack-wizack niggas
Come and feel these triggas, ya figure ya bad
Bellin out Black Haven but I double dem bucks in yo ass, instead
Triple muthafuckin 6, in the muthafuckin plizay
For the n-zine decade
Nigga didn't hear me do, but a muthafuckin click
In somebody's y-zard he laid
Where the niggas in the club?
Where the niggas in the streets ain't down with us?
Man, say a few prayers
G-Ds, V-Ls, cr-zips, bl-zoods, all niggas throw yo setts in da air

[Hook: Three 6 Mafia]
If you niggas ain't scared, throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air, throw yo setts in da air
If you niggas ain't scared, throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air, throw yo setts in da air
Cause we some killa ass niggas
And we don't give a fuck
We come to break the fuckin laws
And tear the fuckin club up
Cause we some killa ass niggas
And we don't give a fuck
We come to break the fuckin laws
And tear the fuckin club up

[Verse 4: Lord Infamous]
When the biblical stories were written they left out the one they call Lord Infamous
Because the horror he possess was one of a magnificence
He was set to be Lucifers only mortal kin
And he was set to lead the world into unholy acts of sin
The architect of hell
And inventor of the six interior decorator of chambers of eternal punishment
I'm the one that lit the furnace to the flame that burns forever
Supervisor of the torture, Lord have mercy? Not me, never
I'm clever with corruption of the Seven Seas and continents
Demonic shit, the blunt is lit, the bong is hit, astonishin
Watch the world - I crumble it, watch heaven - I rumble it
God kicked Scarecrow out of heaven for he did the Devil bitch
Holdin angels hostage in the basement of Hell Chapel
The only nigga to ever set heaven up for a fucking gaffle
The Devil fever flowin through the fire hemisphere
Evil niggas throw yo sets in da air, if you dare

[Outro: Three 6 Mafia]
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air

Ah yeah, 3-6 Mafia runnin this, ho. Playa hatin just don't hear me
