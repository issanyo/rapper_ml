[Intro]
Lord Infamous in this hoe
This for you, you and you
You little internet gangsta motherfuckin' hoes

[Hook: DJ Paul]
I don't know what you've been told
But I ain't no studio gangsta
I will show up at yo show and show you I ain't no wanksta
My niggas, they with the shit, and my niggas, they ignorant
My niggas, they will kill when it comes to bullshit

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
I kill you niggas for the fuck of it
You say you gonna get me first, my nigga good luck with that
If you say somethin' 'bout me one time, then you stuttered it
Now you (?) lil hoes (?) maybe you should (?)
POW, got the fully automatic with the machine drums
Come to a nigga neighborhood and act dumb
My nigga really with the shit
My niggas ... shootin' long guns
Chopper, chopper, nigga, placka, placka, nigga placka
You gon' end up in a grave, not a hospital nigga
223's, AK's, everyday it's a bullet give-away
I'mma pull it nigga, how you gonna try to pull at me
Any-fuckin'-way?
Now homie, you know that's a dead end
Survivors (?) bustin' automatics
You gon' end up dead in the end

[Hook: DJ Paul]
I don't know what you've been told
But I ain't no studio gangsta
I will show up at yo show and show you I ain't no wanksta
My niggas, they with the shit, and my niggas, they ignorant
My niggas, they will kill when it comes to bullshit

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
There's always a nigga in back of the club
Actin' like lil' bitches callin' names
Talkin' all of that shit all damn night in the club
But them bitches did not do a thang
Talk all of that yak if you want to but boy
You best back all the anna away
Cause Triple Six ready for violence nigga
Triple Six ready for bustin' shells
Ain't no use in you showin' out, damn fool
Cause you will just get your damn fuckin' head split
Now sit yo lil' monkey ass down
Cause don't nobody want your damn bitch or your shit
Now boy your ass better think twice
Before you decide to play with mafia boys
Cause when you wish to play with mafia boys
You best bring you some dangerous toys
Don't make me pull out the (?)
And fuck up the dance floor with your hoe-nigga blood
Scarecrow will unload and go loco
And smoke every joke that approach in this club
Now I came to rap and get paid
I did not come to spray up somebodys damn child
But it always gotta be some niggas
That wanna get too wild
Now niggas can't just have some fun
They wanna fight, they wanna gun, for some
Thats the only reason that they come
But niggas like that are the ones Lord Infamous ready for
Just listen to the breakdown for the ones who just ignore

[Hook: DJ Paul]
I don't know what you've been told
But I ain't no studio gangsta
I will show up at yo show and show you I ain't no wanksta
My niggas, they with the shit, and my niggas, they ignorant
My niggas, they will kill when it comes to bullshit
