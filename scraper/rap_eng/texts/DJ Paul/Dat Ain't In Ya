[Intro: DJ Paul]
Yea! Mafia 6ix! Fiend! La Chat!
Yeah, you already know
Check this out: we already know what you wish
You already know what you wish
And it ain't real
I think y'all niggas like some, some comic characters
Or some shit, for real

[Hook: DJ Paul] 2x
Quit playing killa nigga
(That ain't in ya, that ain't in ya)
Quit playin' with 'em nigga
(That ain't in ya, that ain't in ya)
Quit actin' like you trappin' nigga
(That ain't in ya, that ain't in ya)
Keep playin' with me, I'mma put some in ya!

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]

[Verse 2: La Chat]

[Verse 3: Koopsta Knicca]
Son of bitch, it ain't in ya, super cool Koopsta Knicca
Cap peeler, wig splitter, pussy (?) rap shitter getter
Stone cold, too bold, big guap, get money
Kick hoes, snow balls, talk shit, one hunnid
All black everything: armpits, cocaine
Black car, black house, black bitch, black name
Homeboy it ain't in ya, no hard street nigga
Can't fight, won't kill, sissy-ass hoe nigga!
You will never, in no ways, be like me
Tycoon, taifun, tight team (?)
On here, oh dear it is not (?)
Super cool, cold beer, bulled eye, four fifth

[Verse 4: Fiend]
Got triple beam, portable Glock, time to get money
That better means fourty of them Glocks (?) say I'm (?)
Your pockets like rabbit ears
And you never had a fifth
...
I'm russian like Vladimir
Makin' heaven on this earth
...
...
...
And they all make me scourge
You scared ... go to church
What I'm spendin' on the second
What I made from the first
Dirty south is more than vibes ...
