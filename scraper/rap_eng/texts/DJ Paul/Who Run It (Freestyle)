[Intro]
Ayo, one thing before I start ripping
Uh, all ya'll dumb niggas suck donkey dick, whores

[Verse]
Who you think you testing, not me
Like a bratty kid at a school, B
Shout out G Herbo, and Uzi, I'm bout
To destroy this shit easy, uh
Bitch, a nigga popping like a pill or something
Steal a nigga flow, I ain't giving nothing
Get my diamonds blue, like a crip or something
I bleed, but ain't blood, live for fam or something
Don't play with me, I ain't toying
Everything I spit is flamboyant
Niggas they die from poison
I make a nigga have paranoia, like as soon as I get it
I got to get it again, hit or the miss, from the niggas
That sending him in, I might just go fuck on a bitch
In the back of the Benz, crazy I'm still ain't in a looney bin
But I don't care, I'm Rick Flair, giving beats the chair, woo
Kill another beat up in a evil lair
Make my shot, make my way up
Pick of the litter, but all of ya'll trash
Respect to 36, and I'm making it last
These niggas ain't rich, they renting the Lambo's
And Rari's and flexing on Insta, like nigga
Perplex it, that's my message
Leave rap niggas shocked, my flow electric
Please don't test me, please don't me
Only one with bars, on this instrumental
None of these niggas know I am
But it's time to eat, get a dinner pan
Fifteen years old, and I'm so good
That rap niggas wanting to ban me like Lil Xan
Don't disrespect a legend, I push you in traffic sections
And it won't be tragic, like the pill
You'll be popping on the news, now I'm really laughing
I want a goth bitch, thick in the thighs
Get me lost in, damn, I kill beats like this ASAP
Rest in peace to the nigga YAMS, oh my lord
My niggas have my back
I make stupid niggas think
Cuban bitches what I plead
Get me a chain, Cuban linked
Bitch you sinking when I pick up something with ink
It's of interest, and of instantly writing something
That'll hurt a niggas feelings, nigga fuck your feelings
I'm a villain, I portrayed more than I've displayed
Bitch hair on pony tale, so all we do is horse play
Get a hurt on a nigga, like a broke ankle
You'll know the real sound, like a damn sample
Niggas ain't ready, niggas ain't ready
Nigga feel like a black panther

[Outro]
Ayy, ayy, little nigga running shit
You ain't about, leave a nigga casket closed
