And fill you up with dro, and smoke a little that 'till I

[Lord Infamous/Juicy J]
You don't know what just happened
You suffering from a fracture
You rebel let me catch you, I'll beat you belly bastard
You have a bad concussion, from tripple six bone rushin'
You all beat up and busted, you shouldn't have pressed that button
You all bloody and bumy, you yellin' for you mommy
And people think its funny, quit tryin' to out run me
Your eyes are blue and black and, your clothes are ripped and tackin'
You thought that you could hack it, you shouldn't have wore that jacket
'Cuz I wreck it, smith and west and my weapon, we steppin'
To let the still meet your chest and, don't play with these killers
They come from those parts, the north where niggas be pullin'
The whole cart, so mista big playa mista big time playa
You got the shit on lock why you on my dick
Like a bitch walkin' around like you stone high
Hollow tip bullets don't die, nigga they multiply

I'm gon' whoop this nigga
I'm gon' whoop this nigga
I'm gon' take it outside click click (Boom!) with the trigger
I'm gon' rob this boy, I'm gon' mob this boy
I'm gon' call the fuckin killers do a job on this boy

[Chorus]
