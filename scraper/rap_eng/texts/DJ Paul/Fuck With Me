[Hook]
Fuck with me (x4)
Young niggas can't fuck with me (x3)

[Verse 1]
It's a kill again, I'm back for the hundredth time
You destroyed em with the Scale A ton, now I'm back on my grind
Now I'm back on my bills, now I'm back on my kill
Now I'm back with the steering thrill of the blood spill
I'm out of my mind, my mind bit out
Niggas hiding in the hood, thinking I'm coming just by a word of the mouth
They know I turn it out, cuz I'm turnt up
Step in the club, I stand out, they know you burnt up
I sharp suckas up, make you hoes hold up
One glimpse, [?]
Niggas think its Michael Myers when I come through
Niggas think its Mike Myers when they see you

[Hook]
