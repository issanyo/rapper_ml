[Intro: Lord Infamous]
I think of murder, murder on me mind
Murder on the menu, murder on the timer

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Today was a good day, ain't have to spray the K
Today was a good day, pour some Actavis
Today was a good day, I woke up with your bitch
Today was a good day, cross her off the list
Today was a good day, ain't have to spray the K
Today was a good day, I sold a brick of yay
Today was a good day, my brother beat his case
Today was a good day, day

[Post-Chorus: 21 Savage & ScHoolboy Q]
Murder with the .45, murder with the nine
Murdering that bitch, put that dick up in her spine
Murder with the .45, murder with the nine
Murdering that bitch, put that dick up in her spine (Uh, ooh)

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
I don't do love, I don't do hate, I don't do gullible (Gullible, yeah)
Dope in the pantry, serving up candy, watch looking colorful (Colorful, bling)
Got an extendo, it's a new thing, it got kick with it (Ayy, ayy)
Got a new drum, that pa-rum-pum, I can't miss with it, uh
I'm in the four door (Four door), driving it solo (Ayy, nyoom)
Nigga, it's stolen, hop out and park 'em, nigga, then walk home (Brrap)
All of this gang talk, gang talk
Walk with me, red dot on your head turn green
Turn your Twitter fingers to a crime scene (Splat, splat, splat)
Street sweep sweep sweep (Whoop, whoop)
Wonder how I get the dope so cheap
Plug walk, get the bags off me (Whoop, whoop, whoop)
Two for ten going in all week
Twin Glocks don't pretend round me, uh (Brrt)
Hit the deck, going down 'round me ('Round me)
Couple shots have a 'round 'round me (Ayy, ayy)
One clip but it came twelve deep (Whoop, whoop, whoop)

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Today was a good day, ain't have to spray the K
Today was a good day, pour some Actavis
Today was a good day, I woke up with your bitch
Today was a good day, cross her off the list
Today was a good day, ain't have to spray the K
Today was a good day, I sold a brick of yay
Today was a good day, my brother beat his case
Today was a good day, day

[Interlude: Lord Infamous]
Niggas they die, many die, die, dead niggas
I pull the trig-, pull the trig-, pull the trigger
Niggas they die, many die, die, dead niggas
I pull the trig-, pull the trig-, pull the trigger

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
Got the bull for 50 things, now he wanna kill me now
50 drums, air his mammy house, do he feel me now?
Left his kinfolk full of leaks, in the street we play for keeps
Closed casket I aimed for his head, shot him in his teeth
Mud nigga, hood nigga, op killer, thot driller
Memphis Tennessee we got real hitters
Drug dealers, cop killer, gang spitters, sauce drippers
Pussy ass niggas, you need to bleed
Draco bury you like a seed
I know you niggas ain't liking me
Patta, all about that sack-uh
Ran up on me 45 blew out his back-uh
Rack after rack-uh, you know I'm gone stack-uh
Treat this rap shit, man, like I'm hustling crack-uh, Patta

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Today was a good day, ain't have to spray the K
Today was a good day, pour some Actavis
Today was a good day, I woke up with your bitch
Today was a good day, cross her off the list
Today was a good day, ain't have to spray the K
Today was a good day, I sold a brick of yay
Today was a good day, my brother beat his case
Today was a good day, day
