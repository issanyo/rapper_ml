[Hook: Kingpin Skinny Pimp sample]
Tie 'em to my bumper, drug 'em, fuck 'em
I don't love 'em, dump 'em, slump 'em
Put 'em, put 'em in a ho spot
Take me to the stash pot
Tie 'em to my bumper, drug 'em, fuck 'em
I don't love 'em, dump 'em, slump 'em
Put 'em, put 'em in a ho spot
Take me to the stash pot
Tie 'em to my bumper, drug 'em, fuck 'em
I don't love 'em, dump 'em, slump 'em
Put 'em, put 'em in a ho spot
Take me to the stash pot
Tie 'em to my bumper, drug 'em, fuck 'em
I don't love 'em, dump 'em, slump 'em
Put 'em, put 'em in a ho spot
Take me to the stash pot

[Verse 1: Koopsta Knicca]
Well I'm fresh up outta jail with no job, so I steal and rob
Got my charge spark, now them four killa K part
Took all my ninas, got four pistols
Koopsta gotta keep you bitch
6 to the double 6, 6, 6, Triple 6
Creepin' with my desert eagle
Paul these hoes get on my nerve
It's part 2 of a murder, murder, murder, murder
Robbin' bitches, fallin' down
He rather [?]

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
Da Mafia that be my clique
Them other cliques really ain't shit
Don't make me go crazy on you
And I pull out the pistol as quick as it gets
You keep playing me like a clown
I show you how I put it down
I'm calling up Skinny, he got them rounds
I swear we ain't fucking around
I'm matchin', I'm out on the gas
I put on my Jason the mask
That scared them, this Gangsta go Boo be so ratchet
Spearin' your head without asking no question
You better take me to your stash
I want it, I want it so bad
I know that I'm whicked and I'm with this shit
Fuck 'em, tie 'em, drag 'em from me

[Hook x4: Kingpin Skinny Pimp sample]
Tie 'em to my bumper, drug 'em, fuck 'em
I don't love 'em, dump 'em, slump 'em
Put 'em, put 'em in a ho spot
Take me to the stash pot

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
Speedin' in my 60 ceiling cut
Doing [?]
Sag up in my blood, apartment bustin' juugs
With a nigga niggas head
Clap on the 40 caliber sound for the backseat
[?] where his traphouse be?
[?]
Nigga breakin' in the streets and you driving reckless
Showin' off, look likes he wants attention
Run up to a red light that still blinkin'
Grab the 45, cut this 'fore a nigga trippin'
Knockin' on his window, askin' for directions
Then the watch and ring and the gold neckless
Drop it off!

[Verse 4: Crunchy Black]
Hang with Mafi', bang with the Mafi'
Bang with the Mafi', gang with the Mafi'
Put her in the hoe spot, take 'em to my stash spot
Niggas know that I'm for real when them guns pop
They talk that shit I watch their motherfuckin' body drop
Put 'em in the hoe spot, take 'em to their stash spot
Put 'em in the hoe spot, take 'em to their stash spot
Mafia 6ix, we ain't barrin' no bitch
You talk that shit, your bitch ass will get dealt with

[Hook x4: Kingpin Skinny Pimp sample]
Tie 'em to my bumper, drug 'em, fuck 'em
I don't love 'em, dump 'em, slump 'em
Put 'em, put 'em in a ho spot
Take me to the stash pot
