[Intro]
Mobbing, mobbing, mobbing
Just to say we did it

[Hook: Azizi Gibson]
Just to say we did it
Went across the world, fucked a hundred bitches
Ate expensive dinners, played in game of winners
Smoked a blunt in Finland, took a bath in England
Just to say we did it
Sold my fucking soul
For the diamonds and the hoes
Just to say we did it
Just to say we did it
Ran through all your bitches
Just to say we did it
Just to say we did it

[Verse 1: Azizi Gibson]
Bought every game inside the Gamestop
You can call me Daddy Warbucks
Go on tour within a tour bus
Out in Thailand pouring up
Skydiving, throwing money up
In India we riding elephants
Now we swimming where the dolphins is
In the mountains eating steak and shrimp
I don't want to live like you do
Unlike you, I like that new new
Take a plane, go somewhere real cool
Spend some cash, it's really simple
I don't want to live like you do
Unlike you, I like that new new
Take a plane, go somewhere real cool
Spend some cash, it's really simple

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
I went and bought the Bently, just to say I did it
Fuck my ex-friend girlfriend cause she was friendly, just to say I did it
Yeah, I'm blowing down, I'm from the M-town, I fucked your bitch from the throat down
DJ Paul is a dog, I smashed your bitch, she was so loud
I ride around in my king crown, king of Memphis, fucking Tennessee
With my brother Azizi G, smoking and drinking that Hennessy, see
Sometimes we do shit just to say we did shit
Might turn around and regret this shit but that juice box was just too wet
If the bitch fine than a nigga gotta fuck it, if I'm sitting low than a nigga gotta duck it
Coming with fine I ain't ridin in the bucket, clearing my path from these crabs in the bucket
I'm riding with the strap in the cup holder cause these niggas never tuck it
Three 6 Mafia, preHistoric, and you niggas already know it
(Talk to me now, talk to me now, talk to me now)

Just to say we did it
Went across the world, fucked a hundred bitches

Smoked a blunt in Finland, took a bath in England
Just to say we did it
Sold my fucking soul
For the diamonds and the hoes
Just to say we did it
Just to say we did it
Ran through all your bitches
Just to say we did it
Just to say we did it
