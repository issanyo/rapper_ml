[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Break yourself nigga I'm finna blast when I reach for my Glock
Junky motherfucker will get popped tryin' to grab my rock
Punk motherfucker tryin' to make a stang
Take care ya business mane
Fat motherfucker hollow points bust to your brain
Then I got to the payphone and hit the Infamous
And tell him that the old track is gettin' dangerous
(?) got no cheese, so they wanna stang
But you can't beat a robber at his own game
So I jumped in the Cutlass throw the Glock in the stash pot
Can't take a (?) in yo lap cause 5-0 got it hot
I'm just cruisin' the strip tad after midnight
I pick up the Infamous, but still no one's in sight
And then I thought about a nigga I knew who had been trippin'
He was my roadie at now but yo I had to catch him slippin'
Cause when ya assed out it ain't a such thing as a fuckin' friend
If he got it and you ain't got it then he gotta drop them ends
Straight (?) my eyes show dollar signs
I see the (?) comin' out the pockets but it ain't comin' out (?)
So when the shits gets thick you gotta drop off the thang
You a nigga like me because I gotta make a fucking stang

[Hook/Samples]
Cheese, dope and a motherfuckin' holster
I'm in the game, game called the stang
Cheese, dope and a motherfuckin' holster
Breakin' tricks, robbery, then I ...
Cheese, dope and a motherfuckin' holster
Rollin' clean ... now I'm ...
Cheese, dope and a motherfuckin' holster

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
It's the mobster, robster, loco Scarecrow merchant
Searchin', searchin', ready to put some work in
Lurkin', evaluate the figure, fuck (?)
I hope the night produces a couple grams of few damn juices
So stupid nigga would be caught slippin' in a rootin'
Scarecrow meditatin', gotta make a payment
Take 'em to the pavement, get the money and confiscate it
Never be begging for what I be wanting 'cause, bitch, the Scarecrow takes it
I break tricks that don't, you goddamn fool that shit ain't hard to get
Really, really makes you sick when I just broke yo ass bitch
Scarecrow is out stalkin', nigga you should've been watchin'
You don't know the gunman's face that's hid behind a stockin'
Lockin' the clip, yo nigga tell me what you got for me
Give Scarecrow the chiggedy-cheese or this might be a catastrophe
Makin' money, make, make money, make-miggedy mane
Lord Infamous the Scarecrow, I gotta make a stang
