[Chorus: 2Pac, Koopsta Knicca, & MC Mack]
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Still, still fuckin' talkin'
You niggas still breathin'
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Still, still fuckin' talkin'
Which side are you on
Life or death
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Still, still fuckin' talkin'
You niggas still breathin'
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Still, still fuckin' talkin'
The Killa Klan Kaze gon' watch you bleed

[Verse 1: MC Mack, of Killa Klan Kaze]
Ask Jesus for forgivin' for all the sins that I done did
I'm trapped in a storm in a place we call Earth
I tried to stop but I just slid
Into a path where hatas are dwellin'
My life lie in the hands of others
It's so fucked up in this place we call home
Cause it's the back stabbin' bustas
I separate my folks from friends
Is the type of click that I be in
It makes it difficult for me to decipher
Who came to ride to the end
See Ana it's all
Be every be wonderin'
If I'm gonna see tomorrow
So I pack my heat
Off in these streets
Bitch to relieve all this drama
I'm settin' my stake high
To a g to make g's
Cause I'm known to be the Mack
But soon as I take two steps to the future
It seems I get pulled three steps back
You see less fortune in niggas
Start lookin' suspicious, neglected
See we were cool, now I hate em'
Inject the pain', suffocate em'
You smarter than (?)
See ain't no love for no busters
You punks is shaded like graded
See you ain't shit I don't trust ya
Life or Death - there's no one left
The engines miss so brace yourself
Will they allow me to have these doors
I close my eyes and I lost my breath

[Chorus: 2Pac, Koopsta Knicca, & MC Mack]
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Still, still fuckin' talkin'
You niggas still breathin'
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Still, still fuckin' talkin'
Which side are you on
Life or death
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Still, still fuckin' talkin'
You niggas still breathin'
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Still, still fuckin' talkin'
The Killa Klan Kaze gon' watch you bleed

[Verse 2: K-Rock, of Killa Klan Kaze]
Never mistaken your life
I be taken so watch your step (watch your step)
The brothers out there sit wonderin' how can I overcome life
With no closer def
But prophets has raised me up from the grave
But I'm afraid to come back to my life of sin
But see when K-Roc just keep on and take so he's oh
(fuck a friend bitch)
Fuck a bitch
Kill the trick
Lifestyle serves down for my hustle man
Prophet Entertainment motherfucker wanna burp
Killa Play can you say what you do
Keep it to what you through life or death
Triple 6 witness is victims
Or speakers no bitches don't know what is K-Roc himself
These no one left

[Verse 3: Koopsta Knicca]
Smack a bitch
Jack a bitch
Take a nigga shit, leave him headless in a ditch
When you fuckin' with the pit fool
You ain't cool, you and who
Koop and the Killa Klan Kaze will blast
If we motherfuckin' have to
Real from my pump two niggas in my trunk trunk
'Bout that redrum
Why don't you come and get your head bumped
Ransom what I want
Better for your body mon
Scan, Mack, Rock drop your click off to the dungeon
All I want is you to come and walk along with me
Three 6 Mafia and Killa Klan Kaze
Please let the anger free is what the angel said to me
Can you like feel my breeze
Evil deeds between them trees

[Chorus: 2Pac, Koopsta Knicca, & MC Mack]
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Still, still fuckin' talkin'
You niggas still breathin'
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Still, still fuckin' talkin'
Which side are you on
Life or death
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Still, still fuckin' talkin'
You niggas still breathin'
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Still, still fuckin' talkin'
The Killa Klan Kaze gon' watch you bleed
