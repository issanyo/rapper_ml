[Hook: Paul Wall]
Getting full of that purple oil
I'm throwed off and I'm feelin' great
Getting full of that purple oil
I'm throwed off and I'm feelin' great
Getting full of that purple oil
I'm throwed off and I'm feelin' great
Getting full of that purple oil
I'm throwed off and I'm feelin' great
The lean, the lean, promethazine and codeine
The lean, the lean, promethazine and codeine
The lean, the lean, promethazine and codeine
The lean, the lean, promethazine and codeine

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Yellow syrup's the shit, purple shit I mix it
Put it in a bottle, nigga I be so lit
Always got a prescription, I ain't really that sick
But I always stay high, ain't you niggas know this?
Smoking weed, popping pills, I ain't never focused
In your baby mamas ear trying squeeze them big tits
Yeah she kinda ratchet but she suck a big dick
And she like to swallow, all that [?]
What's that in your cup, is it purple stuff?
Got some ecstasy pills, we can roll it up
We can party all night, nigga I don't give a fuck
In the VIP with a pint of yellow tuss

[Hook]

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Call me Tony Tiger cause I'm feelin' great
I got all this white powder on my white porcelain plate
Now it's time to come down, slow down my heart rate
Hit that [?], I need purple bottles by the crate
Purple bottles out the gate, need that purple from out of state
Grind 40 in the state, got that purple like real estate
I'm talking real estate like Donald Trump
Right about now I'm feelin' so slump so I don't even know where I'm from
I need it like some calcium, like white women need their Valiums
Right now I need [?], kill that pussy like a taliban
Purple thang, yellow bars, hasch bleamin' when I pass
Dippin' in my dollar of a hundred now I got [?]
