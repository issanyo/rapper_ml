(Ain't nothin' goin' on but the money and power)
Don't save her (I wanna be saved) she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin going on but the money and power)
Don't save her (I wanna be saved) she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(G-g-got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her (I wanna be saved) she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' goin' on but the money and power)
Don't save her (I wanna be saved) she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(G-g-got one in the chamber for you weak ass cowards)
Don't save her (I wanna be saved) she don't wanna be saved

[Project Pat]
I'ma introduce me Project Pat I keep it real
I'ma introduce you you's a sucka faking deals
If you gonna let these freaky hoes run yo life
I don't understand how you turn a freak into a wife
I don't even get why you be eating out her draws
You done bought the bitch a phone
Now you screening in all the calls
It's about 4 A.M. she ain't nowhere to be found
Some-where wit her friend dick in face and turned to ground
But you best save it last and you know that she'll go
Suckin dick, chewin cat, and I hear she on that blow
Did a line maybe two now she down to do the dew
Took her to the studio so she down to do the crew
I know just what to do
You can ask that ho to leave
Once the bitch pack her shit
Hurry up and run them streets
Two things I ain't never in my life done seen before
Is a U.F.O. or a hoe that wouldn't go

[DJ Paul]
Now once again the big body done got the broads a starin'
They see me ridin' twenty-three's and a playa ain't carin'
Got em' after me, tryin' to capture me
Tryin' to tackle me, care for me, hassle me
I'm ballin' off the B-A-C
I just ain't got no room in my life for a new friend
Especially one that's takin', no payin' or droppin' ends
I'm tellin' em' off top lil' mama my pockets low
I'm lookin' at your purse I'm tryin to come off you ho, for sho'

[Juicy J]
Cruisin' down the street they be like, man he pimpin'
Always checkin' tracks and grabbin' all the women
Chickens see me flickin' be like playa or what
Them twenties blangin' blangin' on that Cadillac truck
And when I'm in the crib they be like hey it's the mack
I'm on them Black & Mild's so I just fire up a black
The thang in playa game is that we tryin' to get paid
My name is Juicy Jigga, no we freein' no slaves

[Crunchy Black]
Ain't nothin goin on but the money and power
Got one in the chamber fo' you weak ass cowards
And I'm tired of you niggas goin' saving these bitches
Stop saving these hoes let another nigga get em'
I ain't trying to be a trick I'm just sayin' my dog
Let a nigga get deep down in them draws
Take her over my dogs so we can do her y'all
Everybody can do it let's just have a ball
Ain't nothin' goin' on but the money and power
Too many niggas out here cowards
They be saving them hoes they be paying them hoes
But a nigga like me can not go
I'm be kickin' in doors I be fuckin' these hoes
I be slamin' em' down like dominoes
Bitch you didn't know it's CB bro
In and out these hoes doough like whoa
