[Intro: DJ Paul]
Woah, woah
Seed of 6ix up in this bitch
DJ Paul KOM
We on that liquid cocaine mane, what the fuck you know 'bout that?
This that shit, distilled water, that vodka
My nasal pump, that blow, let go

[Hook: DJ Paul] 4x
I got that liquid cocaine, caine
In my nasal pump, pump
In my nasal pump, pump
In my nasal pump

[Verse 1: Locodunit]
I’m so high on all of the drugs but I still ain't calmed my nerves yet
She want to fuck on that liquid cocaine, okay now both of my white girls wet
I like it vodka flavor, that's my favorite way a Loco drainin’ that liquid mix
I don't want powder form, I want it (?), I wanna feel every bit of this shit
You don't need nasal spray, this shit will drain you out and you won't have no more symptoms of sinus
Keep that shit off in a nasal pump, when you take you a bump Feds ain't gon' even recognize it
Don't have to slice that shit down in a line, frozen like Jack Nicholson in "The Shining"
I'm never buyin’ it, bitch if I want I promise you I will turn into a scientist
Now you experienced, bitch I’m gettin' high off experiments
It’s satisfaction with liquid, with powder form, I swear this shit is a hit or miss
Ounces of this - I need 36, this liquid bitch is a keeper
I don't need a decongestant, bitch I'm drainin' like a hot water heater

[Hook: DJ Paul] 4x
I got that liquid cocaine, caine
In my nasal pump, pump
In my nasal pump, pump
In my nasal pump

[Verse 2: Lil Infamous]
Don’t bother rollin' a dollar, no need to break out yo bag
Away with saucer trays, razors, cause niggas raid in yo stash
A sacred way to (?) guaranteed to make ya straight
Can heat it consistent chillin', it's safe to take
Get right on the airplane flight, can call it da airline
The pumps from the nasal pumps keep me crunk with no care
I put it to my nose without the haste of a pace
Cause I'm just clearin' my nostrils but I be gone off the bay
Straight to the brain, straight to the heart, I snort, I snort, I snort
I'm on that liquid drip and sniff like I dethawed the frost
Fuck it, we bring a little style down to Funky Town
Cause Memphis niggas known to pass that fuckin' plate around

[Hook: DJ Paul] 4x
I got that liquid cocaine, caine
In my nasal pump, pump
In my nasal pump, pump
In my nasal pump
