[Intro: Lord Infamous and Juicy J]
Yeah fool, Lord Infamous back in the studio
With the Paul and Lord Infamous Come with me to Hell Part 2
My nigga Juicy in this motherfucker, what's up mane?

Yeah I know what time it is
We finna do the Ridin in the Chevy Part 2 on y'all ass
You know what I'm sayin, It's on fool

[Hook] (repeating)
Ridin' in the chevy as we also smoke thay icky mane

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
We finally got a warm day it’s straight in January see
I hopped out of my drop top, once again we rollin' Chevy
Pearl paint, quarter green top, and them gold D's
Dirty bitches choosin' I can't go, I just say "hoes please"
Ballin' clean past, I'm holdin tight to my woodgrain
System bumpin "Greatest Hits", weed smoke invade my brain
Time to get it sprayed, niggas steal every color I get
Everytime I make one up some fool tr-iz-y to come with it
Smokin on a dime boy, then a quarter whats that a 35?
Higher than a mile above the moon on the black haven side
Sturdy inhalin' on some satan
The Lord knows I can’t live without it
Everytime a flame penetrates a blunt I wanna shout about it
But these niggas kill me when that's all they wanna do
Pockets fucked up, but they still wanna get fucked up
You's a damn fool
So I be like watchin' you fools goin' down like every single day
While I ride clean, drop top and mean, Chevrolet, busta

[Hook - 11X]

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Scopin these niggas out on the next block
Cause I know that they ho asses pushin them pounds
They blew my whole sale, fuckin up my mail
So I gotta close 'em down
They got niggas standing 'round with much artillery, but scarecrow not scared
Fuckin up my damn business, I call up the triple six
We catch them tricks unprepared
A partner of mine said they brought in some weed yeah they rackin plenty of stacks
I brought up my niggas, we polished the triggers
I figured its time for the jack
Paul took the side, Skinny took the back
Koop took the room on the front
My nigga Mal took out the window
With the Mossberg pump
I started droppin' niggas runnin' out into the parking lot
Skinny started popping tricks at the back door
He grabbed bout a pound of crop
My nigga Koop blasted them niggas
We missed them on the roof
Paul running with the Tec and a vest
He blast them bitches and grabbed the loot
Dead bodies were scattered all over the cut
We drove off up in the smoke
Now we got plenty money bitch
And we gonna serve plenty of dope
There's no survivors, just the blood scattered all over the place
We built our smoked out loced out in the fuckin Chevrolet

[Hook - 8X]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Is it the marijuana that got my mind clickin'
Could it be Erk and Jerk that got me straight trippin'
Dippin through the green, you so clean, Paul you so mean
A nigga drunk as hell, liquor flowin' through my bloodstream
Flaggin' down hoes on the road, roll to the cut
Honeycomb -hideout
Where them niggas be smoked out on them blunts
Malaka, you so high, let me hit that grapefruit gin
Jumped back in that pearl thang, doin' about one tin
Grin on my face, cause I know I'm bout to make it rich
(Triple Six Mafia) '95 yeah we runnin' shit
Niggas know the score, I'm ten toes on these funky hoes
Everytime you see the chevy ridin' it be full of smoke

[DJ Paul Talking]
Aw yeah nigga Ridin' in the Chevy for the '95
The Three 6 Mafia in this hoe
Don't forget to look out for the tape though
You know what I'm sayin'
We in this motherfucking bitch, for the 95
You niggas can't fuck with us biaaaaaaaatch
