[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Yah, she freaky, freaky deeky, didn't ya see her in a bikini
Porno movies we got plenty, and ya know they smoke them beenies
For this chick, you might be fiendin, for you birches, might be dreaming
If she stuck up, I'm like what up?
I ain't got nothing but lent and pennies
Tell yo boyfriend cut the crap-and, heard he got that fire ass cap-and
Always wearing that shiny white gold, telling everybody its platinum
Don't you groupies hate on Juicy, acting like you never knew me
I ain't the one be dropping dollars, I'm just out to get the chewing
Now she fuckin one of my niggas, pimped the trick weak on the trigger
Watching us on BET and, chilling with our nigga Tigger
Why they dating, I ain't hating, got a call from Sally Payton
Now I'm gaming on this hi-zoe, took her out real latey latey
Pushin Bentleys, riding caddy, when she see me calls me daddy
Heard she like to chief on chronic, roll it up and hit this Cali
You fuck my bitch, I fuck yo bitch, that's the way it is in showbiz
Mane fa sho that freak you don't kiss, keep that spray for smelly fishes

[Hook: Juicy J & La Chat]
I need a coach bag
Bitch you got da game wrong
I need my hair done
Bitch you got da game wrong
I wanna go out tonight
Bitch you got da game wrong
Mane that's just my friend
Bitch you got da game wrong
I need my car fixed
Bitch you got da game wrong
My baby needs some shoes
Bitch you got da game wrong
I wanna go out tonight
Bitch you got da game wrong
Mane that's just my friend
Bitch you got da game wrong

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Bitch, drop that purse like its hot, I'm picking it up like it's not
Stayin fresh in brand new clothes, sponsored by my brand new hoes
Keeping one on every block, she fuck up bust her head with Glock
When I slam Cadillac door's, 17-inch vogues
On the curb, sip and serve, ask a broad "whats the word?"
Wrong answer mean as cancer when I'm on that fuckin bird
Runny nose and roasting hoes, kicking in them hotel do's
Gotta keep that paper right, up all night and hype off white
Big Bizness, Bizness Big when you talking bout pimpin trick
Gotta keep an eye out for them bitches tryna pimp ya dig?
In the 2 thou, mane that shit done got so popular
Push a pimp like me way back like some backwards binoculars
But real pimps gon stay afloat like rubber ducks in white folks tubs
Clouds creeping up above, smoke burning from this bud
Bitch, feel it 'fore I deal it, ho how you gon hustle me?
I'm born and bred by HCP, I'll leave your blood off in these streets! Beatch!

[Hook: Juicy J & La Chat]
I need a coach bag
