Keep a third eye open, on some Egyptian shit. Nigga want a handout, well I can't can't do the shit. Had to get them hands out my circle on some twister shit.

And I can see it cause the crystal clear calling, Blu-Ray Who Dat? Always you hollerin right at my face. Yeah my car new, and my bitch too Got them 26s left them 22s. But you acting brand new we was spending like we was ten. Long acting brand new What yo name again? (I say who dat)
