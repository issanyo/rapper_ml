[Intro: DJ Paul]
Yeah hoe, already know, DJ Paul KOM in this hoe
King shit nigga!
Seed of 6ix in this hoe
The prince in the club!
Gettin' blowed in that hoe
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em!

[Verse 1: Lil Infamous]
Shut off the sirens
Seeking some shelter to share an awkward silence
Remotely I'm lonely, just me and my only, my mind's on autopilot
I'm reminded, my world stands still, maybe why I'm quiet
Divided, antisocial, sociopathic, it's best I hide bitch
With a blunt between these two fingers I believe I be at peace Thinkin' "oh my", how time flies when marijuana (?)
HCP, like THC, hypnotized my mindframe
Medication for the migraine from weed to beans to cane
I got a variety, to hell with sobriety, away from society
(?) I cruise, I'm full of narcotics and I'm in a body
Serotonin, dopamine rush the brain, I know I fiend
Tryin' to find friends on cloud nine but when I come down it's only me, so I

[Hook: Locodunit & Lord Infamous sample]
Solo dolo with my coco
I'm solo dolo with my coco
I'm lighting gas up on my gas stove
Solo dolo, it's just myself and my shadow
I talk to myself cause there is no one to talk to
Solo dolo, it's just myself and my shadow
I talk to myself cause there is no one to talk to
Solo dolo, it's just myself and my shadow
I talk to myself cause there is no one to talk to
- is no one to talk to
I talk to myself cause there is no one to talk to
- is no one to talk to

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
The room is dark, I see my shadow from the candlelight
I see a bag of white, I see the lean and sprite
I'm leanin' to the right, this shit right here ain't right
Oh why must I get so high? Like a nigga just got on a flight
I hear some voices singin', sound like some bitches
What the fuck are these spooky bitches
I'm tryin' to dick all these bitches
(?) I'm so super throwed, c-catchin' drains down my throat
And I'm on sativa kush, shit got a nigga so woke
Space ship high on a regular, I won't even smell it if it's no regular
(?) the federal, high as old man colesterol
I can get high with these niggas - no, too stingy with my dope
Plus when I'm too high I'm too crazy, I'll stab ya for the dope

[Hook: Locodunit & Lord Infamous sample]
Solo dolo with my coco
I'm solo dolo with my coco
I'm lighting gas up on my gas stove
Solo dolo, it's just myself and my shadow
I talk to myself cause there is no one to talk to
Solo dolo, it's just myself and my shadow
I talk to myself cause there is no one to talk to
Solo dolo, it's just myself and my shadow
I talk to myself cause there is no one to talk to
- is no one to talk to
I talk to myself cause there is no one to talk to
- is no one to talk to
