[Hook]
Somebody gon' get they ass kicked
Somebody gon' get their wig split
Somebody gon' get they ass kicked

Beat 'em up, beat 'em up, break his neck, break his neck
Beat 'em up, beat 'em up, break his neck, break his neck
Beat 'em up, beat 'em up, break his neck, break his neck
Beat 'em up, beat 'em up, break his neck, break his neck

[Verse One: DJ Paul]
I never need bod', how could I be scared of a man?
I walk through this land like I run this land
Never can you imagine the pain that I bring
If I said I'mma do it in the streets it's the same
It's the K-I-N, G in here
Wildest man in the world and I have no fear
I'm the mean in the mean, the nightmare dream
The root of all evil, the weak fear me, yeah!

[Hook]
Somebody gon' get they ass kicked

Beat 'em up, beat 'em up, break his neck, break his neck
Beat 'em up, beat 'em up, break his neck, break his neck

[Verse Two: Juicy J]
I'm a crazy motherfucker and I'm comin through the do'
Quick to whup you up and knock yo' ass to the flo'
Think I'm playin wit'cha but this fist gon' hit'cha
Always in the hood, #1 wig splitter
Never try to step cause you know you can't compete
_Live By Yo' Rep_ or get throwed in the streeeet
This boy about to act up, you better call for backup
I'll be the next fool in the hood, bodies stacked up

[Hook]
Somebody gon' get they ass kicked

Beat 'em up, beat 'em up, break his neck, break his neck
Beat 'em up, beat 'em up, break his neck, break his neck

[Verse Three: Crunchy Black]

'Til yo' head like eggnog
Don't think I'm scared dawg
