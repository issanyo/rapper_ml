Yeah, yeah, yeah
112, 112, 112
Three 6 Mafia, Mafia, Mafia (Yeah)
Ahh (112)

[DJ Paul]
I'm in the club drunk as hell with my dogs 112
I got a hundred and twleve gals I'm tryin' to sell
I drink too so I need to holla at the club owner
And hit him with bout ten stacks to keep it open longer

[Juicy J]
112 and Three 6 Mafia we kickin' in the club
Chiefin' on that eeh-wee herb till it's right down to the nub
ATL and Memphis, Tenn mixed together nothin' but love
It's a trip when playas meet, get on this level nigga whaaaat...

[Slim]
Girl talkin' like she gon' be famous
Tonight she got that Goose
Tellin' her that she can take that, take that
The beat got her trippin' and the heat got her pumpin'
And she screamin'  at the DJ "Don't stop playin' that", playin' that
Oh, shorty's got a body, came her with nobody
So tonight ya know I'm gonna frame that, frame that
She drivin' in the truck and sayin' you can be my nigga
But the night is still young so won't you fall back, fall back
Oh

[Bridge: 112]
Damn why she frontin'
When she know that she want it
I can tell how she's on it
Cuz she really wanna see me tonight
I know what tonight can be
If y'all would just work with me
See what's in front of me
Just let me get made tonight

[Hook 2X: 112]
What, y'all closing the club
I ain't finished drinkin'
Can't you see me talking to her
What y'all closing the club
Just give me a few minutes
And she gon' be ready to go

[Daron Jones]
Soon as I pull up at the club, hop out the six
Mr. Valet would you park my shit
Then I bypass security
I'm like, let me off up in the VIP
Then I, spot shorty chillin' with girlfriend
And I'm movin' close to get the open
Look down, my watch was frozen
It's only two o'clock and the club is closin'
I know there's something that you wanna, show me
That henny got me wanna do something, crazy
Then they closed the bar
How the hell y'all gon' play a star
I'm almost there with this chick
Now y'all makin me take her to the car
Now she's trippin'

[Bridge: 112]

[Hook 2X 112]

[DJ Paul]
Now y'all can't shut this down yet
I just got this girl wet
From this watch and this chain around my neck
What's in the lot, I rock a Phantom for a half mil
Hit the lock a flyin' ho goes in the grill

[Juicy J]
Now if the club close early, hell yeah I'ma get mad
Cuz I'm lookin' for this freak, I think she hit me for my stash
Juicy J, yes I'm that gigalo that's lookin' for some ass
She said she gon' chew me up then she gon' swallow up my nads

[Hook 2X: 112]
