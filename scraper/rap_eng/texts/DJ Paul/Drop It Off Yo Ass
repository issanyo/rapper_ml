Drop it off your ass fool

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Massacre, massacre
Lord Infamous and I'm asking for da - stash
I blast, you better come up with some cash
So drop it ... trick empty yo damn pocket
I'm shootin' the miniature rockets
So busta yo ass best to stop it
The Glock clickin' know that I got somethin' for ya
The slug in da chamber
Crackin' a niggas damn skull may be the result
Of the infamous anger
So are you slippin' you suckers, you best to keep keepin' an eye on them windows
Scarecrow is on the jack stroll
Nigga I'm kickin' in da doors
And you hoes, I'll take your motherfuckin' pocketbooks
Criminals like the Scarecrow
Give no shit trick cause we real crooks
I'll take your (?), your drugs, your life and your jewellery
Look into the Scarecrow got them 20 gauge of fury
And if you wanna turn around and look at my face
I'll let your ass see how motherfuckin' lead taste
Slippin' ass niggas yo you best to take your ass to school
My first words are "Drop it off your ass fool"

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Gimme some trick... I'm finna click with the 4-5 Glock
Making motha fuckers fold up bitch it's a hold up
Breakin' niggas down with the motherfuckin' G-L-O-C-K
...to make some bitch ass niggas day
Better than a motherfucker trick so do what I say
Cooperate, cooperate, and everything gon' be straight
Infrared on your head a signal of damn near being dead
I buck 'em down, buck'em down with 16 c-izz-aliber Rounds
And watch the niggas drop, I gotta pop
The cop that get in my way, the automatic gun spray
Up, and down your body, is just a hobby to me
And to drag him to the river after the robbery
Come with me to hell you little bitch
And see how we live in the land of the triple 6
Swan your sissy ass around, I cap and tryin' to be cool
And when I point the .45
I'm tellin' you to drop it off yo ass fool
