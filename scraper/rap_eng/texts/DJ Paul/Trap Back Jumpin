[Hook] x2
Trap back jumpin, everything twerking
And ain't a damn snake nigga in my circle
Erybody eat, cause erybody working
Nigga violators, we gonn turn his ass purple

[Verse 1]
It goes erybody working, ain't nobody on
Country trap bak jumping like it's chris cross
Erybody straight and ain't nobody rat
Cause we ain't fucking with no snakes, send me where them bitch
What you want that's all but it hard bro
And I'm fucking with that plug like I'm tryina some
Used to stay on time, tell them soon as I get em
Then along came molly, kinda like Ben Stiller
Got a couple pounds of kush, if you fucking with that purp
Break it down to plugs and bag it up like the
20 ounces is served, bitch I got that work
Hold the trap for me now I'll show you how we twerk

[Hook] x2
Trap back jumpin, everything twerking
And ain't a damn snake nigga in my circle
Erybody eat, cause erybody working
Nigga violators, we gonn turn his ass purple

[Verse 2]
If you want it you can meet me out in traffic
Busting out the plastic, break it down and bag it
And sell it to an addict, ok
Niggas violate, we putting his ass in a casket
Dope running low, then we robbing like castle
No bank account cause the shoe box, serving calls to my burglar bars
Break in your house, to your pills, call that burglar house
A wretched got that good, bout to hit me a lick
Gotta make a chicken run, now I'm on my moving shit
Yeah nigga, whole night, know the trap twerking
So call me on the phone, don't come to me in person
Nigga need that work, on the first coming
Cause nigga scared money don't make no money

[Hook] x2
Trap back jumpin, everything twerking
And ain't a damn snake nigga in my circle
Erybody eat, cause erybody working
Nigga violators, we gonn turn his ass purple
