Open up that drink, put that in my cup
Standing on the furniture, now we're turning up!
Since we party, party, party, party, party, party, party
Since we party, party, party, party, party, party, party
Open up that drink, put that in my cup
Standing on the furniture, now we're turning up!
Since we party, party, party, party, party, party, party
Since we party, party, party, party, party, party, party

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
It's the first of the month and the club go ham

And I'm always on that Cali, act like Jackie Chan
Man I love a groupie chick I'd like to screw my fans

I'll keep her burna' in my pocket and it will not jam
And if you violate me I'm a pull that trigga man

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Standing on the furniture hundreds on the floor
I don't even I don't see the carpet no more
Cause it's covered up
We got the whole club covered up
Killers over here you see them, we see them they throwin it up
Me in VIP I got a [?] but still, I'm pourin' it up
Intoxicated girls around me they started throwin' up
Get'em out of here, My gang give me a new boss
Sack these freaks up give'em to these haters like a free lunch

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Open up that drink, put that in my cup
Standing on the furniture, now we're turning up!

[Verse 3: Roscoe Dash]
Living life like every day's my birthday
I'm on max, it's time to kill him in the worst way!
Oh, you on deck? Well, let me start you
Now I'm in the club, smokin' like the rastas do!
I'm tryna stay louder than the opera do
And if she says she don't like me then she probably do
And where the club ends, she gon' wait for me
Send my private party, residents was screaming weed

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Open up that drink, put that in my cup
Standing on the furniture, now we're turning up!
Since we party, party, party, party, party, party, party
Since we party, party, party, party, party, party, party
Open up that drink, put that in my cup
Standing on the furniture, now we're turning up!
Since we party, party, party, party, party, party, party
Since we party, party, party, party, party, party, party
