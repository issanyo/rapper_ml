[Intro]
Man, Project Pat in the house
This go out to all the real niggas out there havin' money
Ghetty green, that cheese, that feddi, that loot
Better watch your back man
Cause your friends out to get you for your shit
This is to all these niggas crossin' us here
Smile in your motherfuckin' face
Turn around and stab you in your motherfuckin' back
In a motherfuckin' heartbeat
If I ever catch one of you niggas man
That's a motherfuckin' murder off the top, boy!
Fo' sho', nigga

Hook]
Ghetty green, ghetty green
I gotta get the green
Ghetty green, ghetty green
And that's by any means

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
I'm the man wit the plan
Wit the gaze, wit the mask
Steppin' up to ya fast
Layin' you in the grass
All your blood, ain't no love, on the street
Wit no police, everybody is a rat, everybody's 'bout the greens
You know me, I know you
We grew up in the pen, but it wasn't face to face
You was out, I was in
Doin' time off a crime I committed in the past
I'mma O.G. on the town
As a O.G. I'mma last
In the past I was known as that nigga who would snap
I was quick to bill a cap, but it had to be a jack-
Type move, real cool, yeah that's how he thought we was
Use ta kick it everyday, smokin' out on that bud
That's my dog, that's my nig', that's a bad young brotha
I just got out the pen, I'mma broke-lookin' sucka
Man, fuck that young busta
Eighty grand at his house
Seen his momma at the store
Stuck a nine in her mouth

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2: Project Pat ]
Mastermind, that's the kind of a man that's in my nature
I'mma nigga you don't trust, I'mma killer, maybe raper
I can take a person's life with a knife or a tone
Used his moms as my victim then I called him on the phone
What's up John, where the green, and I ain't gon' ask you twice
Bring it over by yourself, or I'll take your momma's life
In the life of a dealer, they can never call police
Undercover knowin' this
Secrecy, that's the key
One two three knocks at the door
Somethin's lookin' funny
Then my dog let 'im in with his friend and the money
You'se a dummy if you think I'mma let you live sucka
(Aw man, thought we was straight!)
You'se a dead motherfucker!
Shot the joker in his mouth
Bullet went through his jaw
Had to take his momma out cause I'm down for the cause
Fuck the laws if they come
Then I'm goin' wit a blast
Looked his partna in his eyes, then I murdered his ass!

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
I'm the man doin' deals wit the man gettin' robbed
It's gon' be a violent crime
One that will not get solved
When I rob me a fool
It's a duh that his bitch front like I'm sellin' ki's
Then I'm game for the switch
Switcharoo on your ass
Duffle bag full of cash
Then my thugs pullin' up cockin' pumps in the masks
Hit the dash in the black tinted Chevy, trick it in
Now we on the 'spressway
Brought it down, tell my friend
Once again I done pulled off another master plan
Four days downtown
Found a Chevy wit a man's dead body
Somebody shoulda known betta, dog
O.G.'s on the loose
And we gettin' 'bout our hog
Y'all niggas slangin' dope
Should expect a jackin' car jack set up, bitch
Or a damn kidnappin'
But a nigga like me
I'm your neighborhood fiend
Thinkin' of comin' clean
All about that ghetty green, ghetty green
