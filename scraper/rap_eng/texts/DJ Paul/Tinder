[Intro]
Yeah, we got crackhead cut slow on the ones and twos tonight
Telling you about the Tinder blues by the preHISTORIC crew

[Chorus]
Don't you go and wife no hoes on Tinder
That's that one thing you must remember
Guarantee she got a hundred niggas
You ain't the only nigga posin' in her pictures
Don't you go and wife no hoes on Tinder
That's that one thing you must remember
Guarantee she got a hundred niggas
You ain't the only one posin' in her pictures

[Verse 1: Azizi Gibson]
But fuck it
I been swipin' right plus those super likes, need an ass tonight (don't hate)
Left a Uber life, watch her down the pipe, mario is life
One mile away, it’s my lucky day, I'ma hit it right
Met her for a hike, had to do it twice, now the pussy’s mine
And we split the check, she insisted that, man this bitch is tight
She was creepin' on the ‘Gram, hit with me with some likes, so I DM her like
Are you eyes real? Are you really real? She said, “Z you’re so cute”
I know the chick is real cool, but it’s something that you don’t do

[Chorus]
Don't you go and wife no hoes on Tinder
That's that one thing you must remember
Guarantee she got a hundred niggas
You ain't the only nigga posin' in her pictures
Don't you go and wife no hoes on Tinder
That's that one thing you must remember
Guarantee she got a hundred niggas
You ain't the only one posin' in her pictures

[Verse 2: Azizi Gibson]
Titties
Yeah, I need those titties poked out on your default picture (give it to me)
I don't give a fuck who's hittin' it 'cause girl we both met on Tinder (I don't give a shit)
She's a little sex toy freak, old girl ain’t lookin' for commitment
She just want a nice sized dick, finger in her ass and I’m kinda with it
Click click picture, so sexy had it storied in my memory
Let’s talk about cherries, no way I ain’t fuckin’ with no marriage
Shit, I ain’t too embarrassed (yeah), we don’t even share no science
Just keep your lil pretty ass silent, ain’t no point of us tryin' this

[Chorus]
Don't you go and wife no hoes on Tinder (Oh my god, you’re super cute, how are you?)
That's that one thing you must remember (Hahaha, I’m good I’m good how are you?)
Guarantee she got a hundred niggas (Where are you from?) (Well I was raised in Thailand) (What? That’s so fuckin' crazy I just got back from there)
You ain't the only nigga posin' in her pictures (That shit was fire, huh?)
Don't you go and wife no hoes on Tinder (So what do you do for a livin'?) (Well I’m a rapper)
That's that one thing you must remember (What you rap? That’s so fuckin' tight)
Guarantee she got a hundred niggas (You wanna get drinks tonight?)
You ain't the only one posin' in her pictures  (That’s perfectly fine)

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
We ain't lovin' these hoes, that's a hell to the no
I'm just tryna get high with bitches stick my dick clear down her throat, throat
Yeah, that way, I'ma stick it way down that way
Then we gonna play around that place
Bring back, take it back, we gonna end in the face
And you knew all that before you open that app
Before the night is over you gonna end up in her lap
These niggas out here don’t know what this about
He tryna wife the bitch and don’t even know what she about
These suckers out here living on the edge, really out here playin' with life
Tryna make the hometown hoe his wife, that dumb nigga know he ain’t right
I'ma hit her up in the DM, dick her down AM to PM
Roll the bitch a big old blunt walk out the door and never ever will a nigga ever see her
I stay with a big old sack, I gotta keep a weed contact
But when it come to bitches, these bitches, I can’t keep contact
Stick and move is the move, a sittin' duck always get plucked (get plucked)
So I’m crankin' up the whip, will be clean away from here as soon as I nut (I nut, I nut, I nut)
