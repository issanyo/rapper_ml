[Hook x2]
Get up with me nigga
Get up, get up, with me nigga
Get up with me nigga
Get up, get up, with me nigga
I do it for ya haters, I do it for they bitches
I do it for ya haters, I do it for they bitches

[Verse 1]
Nigga I'm a rasta
Or should I say, glocksta
Mobbing like a mobsta
Guns wrong like [?]
Smoking on them cigars
With a whole lot of green in em
Hanging with some killas
With a whole lot of mean in em
Its Memphis ten hoe
Live by and die by
We on the map like [?]
I would have laughed at it
D Paul I've seen the world
This is why a lot of niggas wanna be like me but act like girls

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
[?] like a waitress
Got weapons like the Matrix
These lil niggas all wasteless
They testing my fucking patience
But I got time to plan, y'all ran out of games
This time I bring the pain, to you mothafucking lames
Squares, rubes, cube toys, [?]
We both really got guns, but I really pull triggers
Its evident, who the biggest, some [?] gotta fall back
I got the money in power, I got myself a bag

[Hook x2]
