(Hook)
Easily Executed	X4

(Verse 1)
Cracking niggas jaws, running hoes into walls
Punks begging for they lives, mothafucka I don't pause
When I blast on yo ass I'm gone empty this clip
Nigga live by yo rep, but I ain't taking shit
When I slip in my disguise, letting you know what I'm about
And I'm blasting at the dark, that's gon blow yo brains out
Of yo head, leave you dead, in a pool of yo blood
Niggas died, niggas scared, cause, I don't show no love
Ain't no fear, when I hear, that the police got a witness
Now they looking for a suspect in North Memphis
Whose this realistic killa wit no conscience
Full of that alcohol, never smoking blunt junts
Get the pump, known as the seven shot scatter gun
Splatter some suckas head open, then I break and run
To the car, parked round the other corner of the street
Hit the gas fast, dog a nigga gotta beat the heat

(Hook)
Fuckin wit the nigga like Pat, you can die hoe
When I come out wit the gat, I'm a ?try? hoe		X2

Easily Executed		X8

(Verse 2)
Bow down and recognize, nigga it's a homicide
Fuckin wit the nigga like the patsta, that's a suicide
Mission that yo ass on, besta pack a chrome tome
Suckas play that role, like they killas bring it on jones
Roaming in ya neighborhood, and I got my sawed-off
Caught cha getting yo shit, I got my junt and blew yo ass off
Fool, I'm fo real black, caps I'm gon peal back
Not that psychopathic crazy nigga, but I'll snap
You in half wit my bare hands, trick this ain't no candy land
Hoe this ain't no game, they gon find you in a trash can
Down-town fulla flys, blood drippin from yo eyes
?dig? a hoes body for days, and they can't decide
Who did it, who done it, police on that okey-doke
Say it's drug related cause I did like them white folks do
Late at night, wit no witnesses around bro
Letting yo ass know, if you step, you can die hoe

(Hook)
Fuckin wit the nigga like Pat, you can die hoe
When I come out wit the gat, I'm a ?try? hoe		X2

Fuckin wit the nigga like Pat, you can die hoe
When I (When I) come out wit the gat, I'm a ?try? hoe		X2
