[Hook x2]
This for all you [x4]
Playa hataz who be talking that shit

[Verse 1 : Lord Infamous]
Demonic mind, why must I love to take so many lives
Why do I leave them suffering laying there to die
Why do I send their mother pictures justï»¿ to watch them cry
Why does the devil use me to commit these evil crimes
Why must I inflict all these multiple stab wounds
I'm grabbing the butcher knife
How come I must torture and paralyze victims
Before I'm truely satisfied
I cannot stop tryin' to prove to myself
That I am a weaponary master
So I seem to keep stocking with silencers
Bodies are scattered all over the pasture

[Verse 2 : Juicy J]
Playa hatin' fools, for you fools I got them tools
Tools like the Glock 19 Blasting on the scene
Sumthin' like a nightmare in your dreams
Mean with them guns you can't run leavin' bodys numb
H-to-the-K one I spray Juicy J bar none
I'm always hearin' shit about my niggas in the Three 6 Mafia
Prophet Entertainment on the rise bitch
You fools don't know when I roll up on you
I will have to spray ya
This goes out to the mothafuckers who doubt
Jealous playa hataz

[Hook x2]
This for all you [x4]
Playa hataz who be talking that shit

I hold your head down and I'll fuck you like a convict bitch (talkin' that shit)

[Verse 3 : Gangsta Boo]
This goes out to all you suckas
Playa hata mothafuckers
Jealousy is in you bustas
Ho you know I'm really bumpin'
Triple Six is blastin' bitches, robbin' riches, that's the scoop
Playa hataz mothafucker hate the shit by Gangsta Boo
Nigga just remember all the killas just ain't in yo' hood
Triple Six is all around yo' ass now ho I wish you would
Test this fuckin' playa playa hataz better listen close
Now go run for help my 32 will bring you to the flo'

[Verse 4 : DJ Paul]
Jumpin' out of the house
Fresh black Jordans on my feet
I'm trippin' out off of some rumors
Some bustas said I got killed last week
But the devils don't die, just get high
Fool you don't even not hear me though
And if it's true then that's the red zone
Red shone on the Three 6 Mafia hizzo
Let me break it down for the rumor stars
Who forced this untrue lisp to go 'round
Sendin' clowns with gun down Jakers live not in the M-Town
Check, playa hata goin' home so I got a kinda life stay striz-out
Another fresh paint job and the Chevy thang
Artey Bose but I'm still goin' to miss out
