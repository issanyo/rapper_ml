[Hook: DJ Paul][x2]
Beacon and a blender
Serve a nigga straight to the window
Soda and a pot
Just to keep them junkies spoiled rotten

[verse 1: DJ Paul]
It goes free my nigga double L
My brother C, what's up to Phil
Blender and a couple scales
Breakin' down a couple of bails
Gotta spoil'em gotta keep that shit off in they system
Keep em in the solar system
Try to stay up out da system
Gotta serve to the window on da coca
Driving responsible with the AR
Been tryin' to make it stretch so long my nig
Yayo fucked around and got stretch marks
Im bumpin dat NWA in da hood
When da hoods holla fuck da police
I'm from da Tn, ain't from Texas but i love UGK
I got a pocket full of stones on me

[verse 2: Lord Infamous]
I got a brick no hercules could lift
I was born in powder bitch
What up to Phil D. and Craig
Dunigan been Memphis, bitch
Keep 'em geekin for a hit
Pump their veins with Alpo
Life is lavish, fresh and classic
Don't make me go savage hoe
Niggas with that killa instinct
Maggots crawlin' out their eyes
You order a piece of pie
Pay for it or you die
COCAINE GOD COCAINE GOD
Thank you for givin' us this cocaine rock
Blay!

[Verse 3: Koopsta Knicca]
It’s a beacon and blender ho
Serving junkies big boat loads
Hit dat ho for her fifteen
Watch them comeback offerin more
Dope been the hell to your bitches?
Mommies, aunties, grannies get it
Want it bitch go fuck with me
You know Im about this paper
Don’t doubt my shit don’t doubt my shit don’t doubt my shit
You dummy ass niggas
But if you with me
Tell em is im da Koopsta Knicca
And them we stay kitchen keepin bitches with a knot
Put em on the ho spot take em to my stash spot

[Verse 4: Crunchy Black]
I say I'd never ever in my life sell dope
And then i start to rob
And then i got coke
And then i got weed
And then i got pills
I have to get some money so i get it how i live
I put it in da field and have to tote dat steel
Cause niggas around here ain't never been real
I have the twinkle tweekin'
I had the junkies jumpin jumping
I had these hoes out here doing shit for nothin'

[Hook]

[verse 5: Gangsta Boo]
My boyfriend he got bud and he got powder
Money is in by the hour
Keep them junkies comin' back
Junkie for weed junkie for crack
Ask em where da dollas at
While we watch our money stack
Slangin' rocks all on the block
Koopsta knicca holla at me I'mma holla right back
Boomin' my bricks my nigga chow
Lowkey with his hustle doe
First nigga that i ever saw
Snort out a key of blow
Country boys they got they shit
Mobbers they be hustlin
Money womens beamers benz
Niggas bout they dividence
