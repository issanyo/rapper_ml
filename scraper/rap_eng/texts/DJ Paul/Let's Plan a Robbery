[Verse 1:Crunchy Black]
See I was on the North, North side in the projects Cutterfield
& that where the the dope dealer nigga really live
See they sold crack, & they sold weed too
They specialize in cooking up the dope fool
To get it out, so the junkies can smoke too
But me my nigga, I been smoking out chu
And you ain't you cause y'all been cutting up du
I think I'mma have to touch ur ass with a tool
Its easy come easy go yall know the rule
HCP motherfucker you know I'll cut loose
And if you got it, I'mma have to touch you
Like knocking on your door & holler trick-or-treat fool
Its hard here motherfucker, don't let the sight you
A robbery to a murderer y that's cool
So any way that you want it, I got you
Its 1 the hard way nigga, so fuck you

[Chorus]
Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (lets go...)
Let's plan a robbery (a robbery)
Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (lets go...)

[Chorus continues]
You see good with this yay, but I'm better with these guns
I'm at ya door to collect these funds

You see good with this yay, but I'm better with these guns

[Chorus ends]

[Verse 2:DJ Paul]
I ran up in his spot, with the Glock, his jaw dropped
He knew I came for money & the weight I heard he got
I cracked him in the middle of his face with the tone
Tied his ass up and ransacked his home
I had to rape his bitch cause the ho was stacked
I fucked her from the back, with my gun to her back
I left up out his crib, with dollar & purple hat
But eventually got caught because of a dick hair

[Verse 3:Juicy J]
Don't let me find out that you got that dope
Don't let me find out that you snitching on folks
Don't let me find out that you tryna get rich
Riding round' the fuckin' hood & making fun of niggas shit
Don't let me find out, feds tap a nigga phone
Don't let me find out, cause if I find out its on
Don't let me find out that niggas sellin purple drank
Cause I'mma rob all them fools, like I robbed 20 banks

[Chorus]
Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (lets go...)
Let's plan a robbery (a robbery)
Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (lets go...)
Let's plan a robbery (a robbery)

[Chorus continues]
You see good with this yay, but I'm better with these guns
I'm at ya doe to collect these funds

You see good with this yay, but I'm better with these guns
I'm at ya doe to collect these funds
[Chorus ends]
