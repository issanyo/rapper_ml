[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
This goes out to playa haters who be talkin' that shit
I hold yo head down and I fuck you like a convict bitch
You could me my roadie or foe, kinda down or not
I'm rollin' with a nigga named Crunchy like to clown alot
Backed up by the four-five and the thirty-eight
Automatic G-L-O plus the C and the K
Chris bring a Mossberg with the slugs and shit
We got some graves for your body already dug and shit
Infamous grab the Cali with a hundred rounds
Koopsta load the Tec and blow them bastards down
Juicy with the two Nines like that nigga named Shae
On the move we shoot them up so they feel the pain
I thought you knew that I'm from Memphis
Where the shit is so thick
When at the club we get so buck
We try to tear up sum shit
.....

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
As I cut, guts poor
Blood washes from the shore
To the sand, as a thousand veins
Slither through my hand
Could not withstand a man
From the underland of pain
As his brains hit the grains
And I bury the remains with my fangs
Piercing through a bitches jugular
Infamous bangin' with psychotic serial killers
The Triple Six murderers
Not leaving enough to put in a tea cup
When I'm ready to cook, and I rip up the hook
Cause these niggas get tripped by the Infamous crook
And the Mafia villain would fuck up a rookie
Drop him to his knees with a N-I-N-E
Slug, gets dug and bloody up your rug
Because me really love to make a stang
Mr. high capper don't make me touch ya mane
I got the scope, but not the kind that kills bad breath
I got the kind that likes to fuck up ya good health
Everybody in this bitch lets rip some shit up
I don't give a fuck, it ain't my stuff
You can tear this club up
