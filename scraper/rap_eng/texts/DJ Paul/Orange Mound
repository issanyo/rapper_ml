[Verse 1: M-Child]
Mafia is what I claim
O-M-P is where I dwell
M-Child with a prophet mind
To make you will livin hell
Stickin' to my plan
Deep in evil land
Paper chasin' money freaks
Make The wrong move
And watch my murder rate quickly increase
Scopin' through the darkness of my locs
Like a shadow master
Beat through your windows
On the news, I'm labeled shadow master
But I'm just another orange mound nigga that you love to hate
Slowly risin' to the top and fuck what a nigga say
Words ain't shit but a nut from a monkey's dick
Slurpin' on bananas with no peel bitch
Feel this
Mafia, Creature from the mound lagoon
Causin' much destruction
Check your heart
Because it's full of doom
Hammer super thick
For the once you love to talk shit
Dislocate your arm
And make you do the Bankhead bounce bitch
M-Child is who I be
Never be flippin this record
Controllin' the inside of minds with my lyrics
You hear it and fear what you playin'
At night because yo hoe sleep with yo nine

[Hook]
Orange Mound nigga Orange Mound
Orange Mound nigga then we gonna turn it out
Orange Mound nigga Orange Mound
Orange Mound nigga then we gonna turn it out
Orange Mound nigga Orange Mound
Orange Mound nigga then we gonna turn it out
Orange Mound nigga Orange Mound
Orange Mound nigga then we gonna turn it out

[Verse 2: M-Child]
We comin'
We comin' to invade your motherfuckin' home
Can't nobody save you bitch because we know you all alone
Phone lines cut
Your in a world of trouble with this click
Shouldn't of ran your mouth because your mouth gets you in trouble trick
Talkin' shit I would not recommend for you to do my nig
Prophet runnin' over suckas tryin' to get a fuckin' gig
What I say is real
You don't have to fear or feel me
When you cross you take a loss
That's when you have to deal with me
Callin' me but did ever before because you know we got to rise t-o-p
Quick to make my pocket fatter
And then I got to make a plan to abort my case
Prophet bitch are down because it's written all over your fuckin' face
I told yo ass before
Never test a lonesome child
O-M-P what I be throwin' through the crowd buck wild
Let me get my point across
And my point has just been said
And I know your ass scared bitch
Cause piss runnin' down your leg

[Hook]
