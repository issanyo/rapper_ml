[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Slob on my knob like corn on the cob
Check in with me, and do your job
Lay on the bed, and give me head
Don't have to ask, don't have to beg
Juicy is my name, sex is my game
Let's call the boys, let's run a train
Squeeze on my nuts, lick on my butt
The natural curly hair, please, don't touch
First find a mate, second find a place
Third find a bag, to hide the ho face
Real name Rover, I said bend over
I started to knock, then came the odor
Smelled like mush, should've had a woosh
Told her to stop and take a douche
While she did that, I didn't want the cat
So I bounced out and never came back

[Hook: Juicy J]
Suck a nigga dick or something
Suck a nigga dick or something
Suck a nigga dick or something
Suck a nigga dick or something

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
My nigga D-Magic said he had to have it
I said, "Just forget it, it's too crabby"
Know a little freak, in Hollywood
Sucks on dick, does it real good
She'll give you money, fill up your tummy
House full of kids, parents all schummy
Once had a down, backyard ground
Hit it from the back, enjoy the sound
Lay on the cover, always use the rubber
Till I got caught, fucking with her mother
She blamed it on me, we fought in the street
She pulled out a knife, so I had to flee
Called up the boys, went to her house
Charged the whole place, threw the bitch out
Police busted in, where the niggas at
We left just in time, and never came back
Roll through the hood, waving at the freaks
Who's sniffing all the rocks, and smoking all the geeks?
Made another stop, police station
Saw a few cops, drove by and sprayed them
License tag number, a nigga said he saw...
Bogus all the time, never get caught
