Mayne I'm excited on my way to the weed mayne
He said he got a girl that a nigga need to meet mayne
He said she smell good from her head to her feet mayne
I said what's her nationaility, he said a green thang
She the type of girl that'll have a nigga geeked mayne
Spend all you money like a junky on the creep mayne
And she got some friends that will keep ya high as me mayne
Dancing in the sky with the birds and the trees mayne
I get high like Amy Winehouse
I'll put pills in anyone's mouth
Smoke up all the weed fall asleep on the couch
4:20 that's what I'm about

We some rich niggas, pass the Grey Poupon
Nah dog , more like pass the purple blunt
Smells the funk or the pound  that's in my car
If the police flag I ain't gon' stop
Digital scales for sales, paraphernalia
Either in jail or get bail
That's what they tell ya
I grew up round hoodlums, killers and thieves
Unknown Vice lords niggas claming G.D
One eighty vans show's we hustling
Blowin' purp Cali high , no struggling
Penitentiary the chances that I take
It's elementary I got to gets the cake
