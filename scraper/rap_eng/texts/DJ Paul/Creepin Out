[Intro]
Nigga you know we savage
This for the M-Town, BHZ stand up!

[Hook: Playa Fly sample] 4x
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, se-serve on, now you know I'm out it hard

[Verse]
These haters I ain't even barrin', chillin', smokin' on these trees
Now you know I'm out it hard - DJ Paul from BHZ
Standin' on a tr-izz-ack with a p-izz-ack of that fuckin' snow
Chevy thang by the curb, got them stash box in that hoe
These haters they can't creep on me
I got these killers all around me
Ready to pull that fuckin' h-izz-eat
Put these bitches straight to sl-izz-eep
I can't toy with you niggas no more
Especially when I'm on that blow
That blow'll make me murk a hoe, pull that .44, work a hoe
Ridin' in that Rolls Royce, I guess that's why they mad though
But they won't run up on me though
Cause them niggas, they scared yo
Hit 'em with the lead though, I'm aimin' for they head though
These suckas shoulda layed low, these bullets put 'em red yo
Hundred round clips, I pull from the hip, I shoot off the rib
You shoot from yo lips, I shoot off yo lips
Flash as I make 'em do flips
I don't play with these niggas, I stay on these niggas
My goons are ready do away with these niggas
Creepin' out the cut with automatics up
They ran out of luck when I run up on these niggas
MAFIA!

[Hook: Playa Fly sample] (until end)
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, se-serve on, now you know I'm out it hard
