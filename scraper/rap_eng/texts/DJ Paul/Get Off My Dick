(Chorus)
Get off my dick, ho get off my dick

(Crunchy Black)
This goes out to you new school fools
Keep talkin that shit and I'm gon' break rule
And leave ya'll bitches with some motherfucking bruise
And make it happen for ya leave yo ass on the news
See I'm a dog nigga so you feed me dog food
Its CB nigga and you know I ain't cool
You know I do shit that you say I dont do
I come by myself I dont need my fucking crew
And I'll pop you and them lil boys too
Its makes no difference what ya'll wanna do
Do you want me give you one or hit you with two?
Its HCP lil lame ass dudes

(Chorus)
Get off my dick, ho get off my dick

(Crunchy Black)
I'm like incredible hulk I'll put it on you bad
And bust out my clothes when you hoes make me mad
And pull out my pistol motherfucker no mask
You weak young niggas ya'll break like glass
Now simon said nigga move ya'll ass
But ya'll didn't listen so ya'll got blast
You wanna catch up then you better think cash
See I'll be the future nigga you will be the past
You moving too slow or I'm moving too fast
Maybe cause you jones got a mouth full of trash
I'm a put you in a bad and dump yo ass
Its HCP nigga coulda been with that

(Chorus)
Get off my dick, ho get off my dick
