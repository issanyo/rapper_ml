[Intro: DJ Paul]
People tell me not to blame myself, but alotta times I wonder if I never put the group back together, Da Mafia 6ix, would Koop and Lord still be here, you know?
Maybe it was too much for 'em, maybe it was too much excitement at one time?
I still remember how happy Lord was to see the group back together, because I think he wanted it more than anybody else
If you love somebody in life, make sure you tell 'em on the daily because you never know if you're not gonna get that day to tell 'em
They say with life; "Your book is already written", so maybe it wasn't because of the group
But if we believed that our book was already written, we wouldn't walk around with guns or lock our doors at night
You know, but that's just me...

[Verse: DJ Paul]
I can put this shit in words but this shit never could explain all the suffer (explain all the suffer)
How much I miss Koop and Lord, oh Lord, they my niggas, they was my brothers
It'll never be no niggas like them niggas 'cause them damn niggas the best niggas ever made
Best niggas to rap over beats that I done made
Best niggas I ever had a chance to share stage with
Had a chance to light and blaze with
Had a chance to get throwed with
And did I mention grade six? All that shit in 1996, a nigga went gold with it (gold with it...)
Then the hits wouldn't stop, gangsta niggas from Memphis Tennessee sellin' records like they went pop
But we wasn't talkin' 'bout no pussy shit, we were talkin' 'bout how we gonna get a bitch and make her pussy pop
Make it pop
Make it pop, make it pop
To the top of the charts
To the top of the charts
We were talkin' 'bout the sizzurp, snortin' on the cocaine
Tearin' up the club, shit that wasn't in the rap game
We created the crunk, we was that fire, we was that propane
Hussein - light that shit up, let it engulf in flames

[Pre-hook: DJ Paul]
Ridin' the Ferrari in the slow lane
Thinkin' 'bout my brothers brings slow pain
So much pain, so much pain
Everything we did, I wish we could do it all again
Mafia 6ix - I got a chance to put the group back together
Was that a mistake or was it just fate?
'Cause soon or later Lord and Koop would end up in heaven...

[Hook: DJ Paul]
It'll never be no niggas like my niggas
We got money, stack the shit to the ceiling
We put hits on all them charts
Everything they do, we done already did it
It'll never be no niggas like my niggas
We got money, stack the shit to the ceiling
We put hits on all them charts
Everything they do, we done already did it
Like my niggas (no, no)
Like my niggas (no, no)
Like my niggas (no, no)
Like my niggas
It'll never go away...
Like my niggas (no, no)
Like my niggas (no, no)
Like my niggas (no, no)
Like my niggas
It'll never go away...

[Outro: Lord Infamous, Koopsta Knicca & DJ Paul]
Where is da bud, where is da bud?
It'll never go away...
Where is da bud, where is da bud?
It'll never go away...
Here 'dem come, waitin' to come
It'll never go away...
Say is it the sun if the rain don't come
It'll never go away...
I'm not the type to get involved in long relationships
It'll never go away...
Takin' trips and buyin' gifts, I'm sorry, I'm not on that tip
It'll never go away...
Crucifix spread with bloody red all on my pillow
It'll never go away...
Fool moved by my window so I call my nigga Scarecrow
It'll never go away...
