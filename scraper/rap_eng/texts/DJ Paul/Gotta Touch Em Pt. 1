[Conversation between Lil Buck and Crunchy Black]

[Gangsta Blac sample in the background]
Psycho in da cut, with da mask and da pistol grip

[Hook: DJ Paul]
I gotta touch 'em, I gotta touch 'em
I know he's bad

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
As I tip-toe, I tip-toe real slow
On the route to them niggas hotel room door
I know that they weighin' up dope
And I kick it all in and make all them hoes bloody the floor
Take all they money and coke
And I hop in the Steamer and bounce to avoid the 5-0
Nigga don't slip or you get tore up by pistol grip
And I know you don't wanna be smoked by Scarecrow
A pop, it's another big set of three bullets ... casualty
Just place off all that shit, there won't be no brutality
Hey nigga don't play me for no fool
Cause I know you got plenty of ends
Don't make pull this trigger and cave yo motherfuckin' face in
"C'mon dawg lemme get some of that dope mane"
-Naw bitch
"C'mon dawg lemme get some of that cheese mane"
-Naw bitch
"Aw mane c'mon lemme keep something mane"
-Alright my nig
I tell you what you get: this motherfuckin' bullet trick
A ... punk motherfucker gonna take them doses in his chest
Cause Triple 6 we cleanin' motherfuckers like the IRS
So when Lord Infamous on the creep tour
With the big, black gun
I'm gonna reach out and touch someone

[Hook: DJ Paul]
I gotta touch 'em, I gotta touch 'em
I know he's bad

[Verse 2: Crunchy Black]
It was on a sunday night, a nigga hit Paul back
He said he had a job for us to do
To meet him at the Hardy's on the mall and (?)
My girl beeped me, she told me Paul was on his fuckin' way
He hit me on his cellular phone, he's balling down parkway
Paul rolled up in the Chevy thang
I jumped in the back and fired up a dooby mane
And that's when Lil Buck explained
How we gonna touch them hoes, shake them hoes
Put 'em in the Chevy trunk, drop 'em in the nearest junt
Pussy nig in his shoes, dump 'em in a river fool
Tie a rope 'round his skull and drag 'em with a fuckin' boat
Crunchy Black ain't no hoe, nigga you don't hear me though
Easy come, easy go, easily I shoot you hoe

[Bridge: DJ Paul]
Well Crunchy Black I know you ain't a hoe
But prove it to them bustas that (?) they fuckin' dough
A rich trick that splurges really needs to be touched, but wait
I tell ya how my robbery spree was created after the break

[Hook: DJ Paul]
I gotta touch 'em, I gotta touch 'em
I know he's bad

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
My life was up and down for the Killa Man as a youngsta
Sellin' dope at age 13 and later gettin' blessed as a gangsta
Sellin' 2 dollar junts at the junior high
Lil near I had pure, I kept the whole school high
Took my little cheese to buy some Fila boots or a cane
Gold and a LL Cool J troop jogging suit
That shit was on back then and trill
My brother Phil D. was boomin' keys
He always thanked me with some (?)
One day the feds kicked his fuckin' door in
(Aww shit) now all the shit done come to an end
Ridin' the strip in a Candy Apple Vette
Or a (?) gold rims and a drop top
But now I gotta think of another plan
I joined up with some trill ass niggas
And the street named me the "Killa Man"
A fast get-away I bought a chevy 350 big block
And plus some life insurance
I bought a brand new plastic Glock
Cause my .380 started to jam up like James Brown
I could barely let loose of full three rounds
But now I gotta make 'em lay it down
I gotta make 'em lay it down
The 6 double-6 mobbin' niggas rush
This is the touch
