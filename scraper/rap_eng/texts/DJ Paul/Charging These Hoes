[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
What the true players doing, ooh? They making these hoes pay
The mothafuckin' cost, to the real mothafuckin' boss
Pimping is how I make my living, you fools need to keep paying bitch
That's why you getting poor, I'm sturdy getting rich
Why they paying these hoes I can't fear it after
The bitch be chewing is throwing her whole fucking back out
And not get a dime after, what? ho I don't need ya
What? I'm gonna eat ya, bitch I'm 'bout to beat ya
And what's up with them hoes who made the song Chewing Ass Nigga
Tramp-ass bitch have you forgot that I had the picture from the cam-corder
In the closet, caught you hoes slipping, these bitches be getting mad
When they here, their name on the tape, they start to tripping
That's how it is fucking with a Backyard nigga
My nigga Lord Infamous got fingers on the trigger
Aiming for your face, letting you hoes know the score
Yo Juicy, what the niggas doing? (They charging these hoes, mane)

[Hook]
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes

(Hoes, hoes, they ain't nothing but hoes)
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What, what them niggas doing?

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I met a little freak bitch, who always wore tight shit
Had five kids and her pussy had a tight grip
The first of the month came, the first of the month came
I saw the mail man coming now it's time to run game
Give me half the check bitch, niggas like me never quit
Big nose red bitch, let your lips meet my dick
Pay up the money for the running of my cum on your tongue
Juicy Low Down J will never get sprung
Never was your friend see, all a nigga want is cheese
McDonald's, Crystal's, Burger King, Wendy's
Whatever kind of check it is, charging hoes is my biz
D-Magic, Project Pat, I know my nigga down for his
Yeah, you hoes know the score, wanna fuck, gimme the dough
Credit cards, crazy checks, all that type of shit will go
To you little dirty freaks, keep my name out your mouth
Unless you want a job bitch, that's what I'm talking about
