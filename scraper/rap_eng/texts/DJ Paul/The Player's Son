[Verse 1: K9]
So, I typed a text to a girl I use to see
But that bitch ain't even read it, so I guess it's meant to be
And I know it's hard to fly when you're connected to the ground
But I guarantee those clouds are filled with family looking down
So I keep my head high
Like a smoker bought a pound
No matter how it sounds, I hope she'll always be in sight
And as many times she left, she looking for her Mr. Right
I ain't missing you baby
I know you wish it phased me
But all this pussy cat that's in my lap keeps me off track
Bullet trains, would shoot at your name
Without warning
If you really want me back then you gone wait until the morning
So real, I keep it a bill, then give you some
If I don't then take it all
Except the pictures on the wall
When I hit the road you know I never call
But that's because my potna in my ear like "You a dog!"
Shit, got dammit
I dont understand it, this the toughest
When they reaching for my buckle
Only words I've got is fuck it
You know I got your back like chiropract
Shit, you know I'm smoother than Jergens
Bitch I know you heard me!
Keep it pimpin, furry furry
What will it cost me?
You know I ain't a pimp but this the shit that 3 Stacks taught me

Keep your heart K9, keep your heart
These girls smart
But I'm a smarter
