[Intro]
Ah yeah, y'all know what time it is
Tear the club up boys back up in this motherfucker
Y'all know what time it is, we gettin' it crunk for the motherfuckin' '97'
Biiootch
Y'all can't handle this motherfuckin' shit
It's on for the '97 motherfucker
Nine nickel in two pennies
Ain't no toms was a nigga words clearly biiootch
We finna do this motherfuckin' shit like thiis...

[Verse 1: Koopsta Knicca]
I ain't rollin' Ox and Vogues, chrome and gold I'm lookin' for
Bustin' through them club doors
With the skimask on you funky hoes
Woodgrain chevy thangs
B-i-ricks with them boomerangs
'Burban with that fresh paint gleemin' with that clear mane
I ain't playin', I'm insane, gon' get you with that killin'
Murder, death, kill now I'm flexin' in your lexus
Stress me if you wanna, gonna follow around the corner
Then I holler at ya woman, turn the volume way up on ya
Foolish ass punk, makin' noise in my trunk
Tryin' to get his ass hurt, I'm in them curbs and them speed bumps
Thump, thump, thump, finna get him, can you feel me
Three for my pump, finna blast him and I mean it
Itchin' for a killin' nigga for I kill a man
Didn't want to hit 'em but that bitch kept playin' with mine
As I tried to stop'em, but he kept on runnin' low
So I kicked him in my trunk before he got to the door

[Hook (x2)]
We gon' get it crunk motherfucker, we gonna get it crunk
If you ain't crunk or buck, what you gotta get the fuck
One fool got himself hot and got the fuck off the floor
But I smoked his ass before he got to the door

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Nigga's up in the (..?..) wait till Lord Infamous kick in the door
So just elbow your way through the crowd
Stomp your feet on the floor, just get ultra like buck in this ho
Bitches get (?) weak asses out
Cause it's going down right about now
Tearin' and riot (?) cause chaos
Cause we comin' straight outta the rowdy ass south
Crank up this bitch till it shake like a natural disaster, earthquake to blow up the scale
Name was the Triple 6, end of the world we can enter this bitch (?) raise plenty hell
Next time we gonna fuck up the club, we gonna rip it up so riots break out
So people (...?...) like the war started and ended now

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
I'm takin' care of my motherfuckin' business, I ain't goin' bitch
Nigga's claimin' killa all the time but ain't did shit
Flodgin' round town, talkin' about what they gonna do
Knowin' if they step up to this pimpin' it's a murder fool
Never try to dodge a nigga cause I let my nuts hang
Strapped with the Smith and Wesson if I have to bring the pain, bring the pain
Bring the game, nigga we gone get it on
Smokin' motherfuckers in the night until the early morn'

Chorus 2x

[Verse 4: Gangsta Boo]
Now it's time to get buck wild, nigga's on that crystal
While my nigga Paul and rowdy Chris head to funkytown
Baby come and get it crunk
What's up, what you scared or somethin'
Loddy, doddy party fuckin' hardy till you fuck up somethin'
Fuck the fuckin police bitch, they can't fade the Triple Six
Once they see how crunk we get it they gone want to join this shit
We gone get it crunk, nigga keep it crunk, stayin real
Always smokin' scopin' motherfuckers tryin' to keep a meal, Big Baby

[Verse 5: DJ Paul]
Time to tear the club up thugs, back up in this ho
Nigga thought we was washed up but we got plenty more
Aimin' at your ass, once again for the nine nickel and a couple of pennies
My words clearly, tom's in so you can hear me
You know the loco break the law but that was '95
Mystic Styles worldwide hoes realize
Chris got the mossberg but they ain't dead yet
The Three 6 gonna be alive till we get it crunk
