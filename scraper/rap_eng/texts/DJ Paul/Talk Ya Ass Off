[Intro]
Talk ya ass off
Talk ya ass off
Talk ya ass off
Can ya back it, can you back it, can you back it up?
Talk ya ass off
Talk ya ass off
Talk ya ass off
Can ya back it, can you back it, can you back it up?
Talk ya ass off
Can you back it up?
Talk ya ass off

[Verse 1: D.J. Paul]
Talk ya ass off nigga let's see what you can do
When I got my glizzock pressed up at your nappy ass head
Gonna say was it you, fool?
Shoot on yo sissy bitch ass is easy, no need to get emotional
Because first of all everything is business, ain't shit personal
A hundred times I caught your ass slippin'
All high off the drugs I could've start trippin' and rippin' your head off
With the tech 9, but you don't hear it
Trying to test my pimpin' I'll run up on you
Cockin' it, you will feel it poking up your nose, boogers on my barrel
Pull the trigger back and watch your head just scatter
Go to the funeral cause some shit like that it's straight to me
Ridin' in the limo with yo folks 'till you tried to play me
Bitch I don't fuck around, I'll put your ass underground
You know you goodas gone when you hear the (gunshots) sound
You run your mouth, but you'll eventually have to pay the cost
For talkin' your funky ass off, busta'!

[Hook]
Talk ya ass off
Can you back it up?
Talk ya ass off
Can you back it up?

[Verse 2: D.J. Paul]
Now niggas always talking that fucking shit
Sayin' what they do but never doin' it
Talk ya ass off, I'll blow yo' ass off, there's nothing to it
I got a tech that'll take yo' ass out
And if you don't believe me just try me
I bet your sissy ass get ran up by the Triple 6 Mafia
Got you fools, petty fools complain [?]
With the shit all of [?]
And my niggas down, my niggas down to clown
Oh you? Oh you to? You don't have a fucking clue, fool
You just talk a lot of shit, but shit don't impress me
You better bring it on [?] and try to even test me
A vest see can never even save you when I start to bust
Automatic rounds coming at you from every end, watch your head bust!
Da Killaman DJ Paul is rollin' with the Serial Killaz, Lord Infamous
And pull it got fingers on the trigger
And all real niggas take care of they business, that's boss!
And bullshit bustas talk they ass off!

[Hook]
Talk ya ass off
Talk ya ass off
Talk ya ass off
Can ya back it, can you back it, can you back it up?
Talk ya ass off
Talk ya ass off
Talk ya ass off
Can ya back it, can you back it, can you back it up?
[?]
Talk ya ass off
Can you back it up?
Talk ya ass off
Can you back it up?
