[Intro: Sample]
Will-will-will-will
W-w-will-will blast if we motherfucking have to
Three 6 Mafia, Mafia
Mafia, Mafia, Mafia...
Will-will-will-will
W-w-will-will blast if we motherfucking have to
Three 6 Mafia, Mafia
Mafia, Mafia, Mafia...

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Say hello to Three 6 Mafia
Got the stick up through the mask, we be watching ya
And we quick to biggy bang bang a rookie
Trip you like a cookie
'Fore you know it, you'd be saying Killaman is too fast

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
You guys can't play the Gangsta Boo
Coming to you with a whole bunch of shit that's gon' fuck your ass up
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga get buckwild
In this muthafucka, let me see you do your stuff

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Will blast if we motherfucking have to
Tie your body up with the string from your tennis shoes
Juicy J in the house, puffin on a light Kool
Those who wanna step to the click, it's a murder, fool

[Verse 4: Crunchy Black]
Who I be? Crunchy Black
You'll know who I am when I come up from the back
Kicking dough, making hoes
Lay it down 'cause I gotta have a motherfucking pocket fat

[Verse 5: Lord Infamous]
I'm the nigga Lord Infamous, the Scarecrow
Demons be dancing 'round my throne
I don't know why every time I see your face
I'ma spread like Rome, bring it on, Jerome

[Verse 6: Koopsta Knicca]
Who that be between them trees
Trying to take a peek at me [?]?
If you from these other realms
I tell your group have nothing left
