Down to unknown wit a 9 millimeter clip
Some think they bullet proof, some end up Benedicts
Which one of you fools wanna make them thangs clap
Tear da club up, where my thugs, where dem dollars at
Where dem playas, scream like a fiend for dat ghetty green
Gotta get da cream, get da cheese, dats by any means
If ya real, then throw ya set, let me see ya sign
Project Pat, from the southside, out here on the grind
While the gettin's good, gettin mine, represent the hood
Try to hold me back that one time, but I'm to the good
Wanna see me locked in a cell, throw away the key
Haters want me dead, but you tricks gotta bury me
Drinkin hennessey, full of herb, mentally I'm gone
Ready man to ride for my side if they right or wrong

Where dem dollars at kid, yo I read and I closed

And we do the same things cause we smoke on wood
Yo, you my wodie ha huh, I'm your wodie ha huh
Yo fuck wit us we leave a nigga fuckin holy ha
And I'm battin crews down to Baton Rouge
And I got a Hummer sittin on 32s
Got a Hummer sittin on 32s

And get high off them Optimo and white line

And if you gone and you know it, fool press rewind
