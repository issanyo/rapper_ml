[Hook/sample]
First I grab yo neck and choke you out
I bet that you didn't know that you's a victim of this shit
That shit that we be doin'

[Verse 1: Gangsta Blac]
Now I got my niggas ... on the fuckin' side of me
Another nigga scarred, comin' hard from my SPV
See you got me fucked up
If you think that Gangsta's fuckin' soft
Now I'm comin' through South Park
And I'll be damned if I don't break you off
Give me one, give me one, yeah smoke some fuckin' hay
Who got head, fuck that shit, let's go and get a Tanqueray
Ridin' through the park, laid back, so civilized
But inside that funk can hypnotize
Have you feelin' woozy, grab that Uzi, load a full clip
Livin' with the automatic, Fly let's go and kill that bitch
Gotta have something real quick when I get that hoe
Let me call slick I know he's game to ride that 5.0
How I'm 'bout to kill me a motherfucker
Any kind of motherfucker *BOOM! BOOM!*
Now let me see if I done killed that sucker
Yeah he's gone, met the chrome
Buck him till I saw some foam
Comin' out his fuckin' mouth
Always tryin' to claim the South

[Verse 2: Lil' Fly]
Yeah they done fucked up, cause a playa's on the scene
Grow up on the boomin' track, now I kick it on our lean
Night and day, gang bang, just around the fuckin' way
Where Playas always stand they ground
Stayin' funky, chiefin' hay
If you wanna cross the ground - time for the beat down
Psycho panic gangsta weed
Bring them tones and plenty people
Before we hit the parkin' lot South Park is gotta get so deep
Lotto with the Glock, Slicky Ricky hella Tony T
These Playas make you cannot stop
I'm standin' with the mastermind
Of the fuckin' lyrics, Paul's beat and the devil's lines
See I dwell in SPV with my folks, that's every night
No it's not a gang, it's not a club, it's just Fly way of life
I-B-N in the wind, cause I have no fuckin' pity
Chronic City, Funky Town, Funky Town, Chronic City
Lil' Fly is in this motherfucker, treat you bustas like a bitch
*POW POW POW* now you victim of this park shit

[Verse 3: Gangsta Blac]
Niggas down to make some ends, niggas you ain't makin' fuck
Keep on talkin' shit, I swear I jack you for yo fuckin' truck
Psycho in da cut, with da mask and da pistol grip
We be with the thirty-eight, slug on his fuckin' hip
Hoe you get me fucked up
Cause you know I likes to pack a gat
Killas from South Park Way, now how you gonna fuckin' act?
Loop with the .40, he ain't shorty, he'll shoot the bitch
Russel got his back I know he do it, he's on that funky shit
Man got a plan that he made, to get that hoe
Peep that bitch, kill that bitch, we got dawg on the floor
Lotto with the Glock and it's cocked, 'bout to shoot the bitch
Dre on his way, he got my back with a full clip
Kiki, Little Sun, Little Tiger and Mario
Down for a one-eighty-seven on a fuckin' hoe
Yea you get me fucked up, don't you ever try to test my nuts
Big Rod with the Glock, 'bout to pop you in yo fuckin' guts
Grab you by yo face and try to squeeze it till it's turnin' red
Hoe I'm not gon' let you loose until I know yo ass is dead
Stick you to the fuckin' ground
Make you make that ugly sound
Kick you in yo fucking dick, ain't no fuckin' witnesses
Lock you in the fuckin' trunk, while I hit the fuckin' funk
Now I'm goin' crazy man, all I see is blood, man
Comin' out yo fuckin' skull
Hoe I'm showin' no fuckin' love
Hoe you just can't suck my dick
Cause you's a victim of this shit

[Verse 4: Lil' Fly]
Lil Fly comin' out hard for the '94
Time to let these bustas know
Let these hoes know the score
South Park's in the house from the '93
Now we're gettin' deeper and we're takin' what we wanna G
Gotta peep my nigga Slick, get a pack of crunk and shit
Me and Gangsta Blac, and you know we gettin' full of it
Hangin' on the boomin' track, better known as night and day
Liquor store, right next door, let's go get a Tanqueray
Funky Town's in my brain, got the tang in my blood
Pain burn a nigga out, now I gotta bust some nuts
Or bust some fucking caps and take some bustas off the map
Got no feelin' in yo face from my mighty Glock slap
Devil made me bring my tone with Gangsta, came alone
About to make me break my shit
Gangsta let me shoot that bitch
Takin' turns, fillin' caps when that busta full of lead
Paramedics came but they can't help him at the med
A day or two later word is gettin' back  to yo folks
Now they rushin' to the med, lookin' for the (?)
Cause you still ... cause of the death of the E
Too much lead to the head from Lil Fly and Gangsta B

[Outro: Lil Fly talking]
Yeah, this Lil Fly up in this motherfucker
To that busta all up on my nigga d-izz-ick
Yea boy you keep on talking that shit
You gon' be a victim of a 211
And I ain't scared to turn it to a 187
Biatch!
