[Hook: Locodunit]
I'm just vibin', no one beside me
Drinkin' and drivin', you're uninvited
Do my drugs in private, need peace and quiet
Nobody needs nobody, so you're uninvited

[Verse 1: Lil Infamous]
So over being sober, seems only the dose (?) lifts my spirit
See, I see clearly with bloodred eyes, fixated on catchin' fixes
Vision blazed and dazed and they say I should change my ways
If I die lately pray my eyes dilated, I'm just crazed
(?) they pity me, epitome of a lonely stoner
To paranoid to feel that void, I just avoid the wonder
Yes I'm a druggy, I'm a drunkard til God calls my number
Til I go under, cause if I'm not high I'm still a gunner
Too many scared to face the price, some men just break the ice
And take a slice off, the saucer tray tastes like grated white
Leave me alone, I'm overly stoned like papa and poppin' em stones
I'm right at home, my drugged out state is where I belong

[Hook: Locodunit]
I'm just vibin', no one beside me
Drinkin' and drivin', you're uninvited
Do my drugs in private, need peace and quiet
Nobody needs nobody, so you're uninvited

[Verse 2: Locodunit]
Stuck in my ways like a statue, feel like Cleopatra
Yeah I'm a been at you, bitch I leave you naked like Erykah Badu
I'm stuck in my ways like a tattoo so nigga be careful
Bitch I got a nine milli in my apparel, got smoke out the barrel
I smoke out my bitches, free smoke for whoever come nigh
I catch a body quick as catchin' vibes
I put yo bitch out, she couldn't handle a G
Then I smoke you out, you can't even handle a G
Yo this pistol got bodies like anatomy
Tuckin' Rolling Stone, keep me a full magazine
I get higher, I keep me a full bag of weed
I get loc, I keep me a full bag of sand
I'm mackin' eleven bitches with a Mac-11 and I'm up in that Mac-10
Feel it when you smoke it, niggas know I'm antisocial
I know when niggas ain't right so niggas get the disposal
Hold up let me pour up my (?) like (?)
Still I got a good bag, fuckin' with the yoda
I like my own company, liquor and bud in my custody
Havin' a party all by myself, you're not invited to come with me

[Hook: Locodunit]
I'm just vibin', no one beside me
Drinkin' and drivin', you're uninvited
Do my drugs in private, need peace and quiet
Nobody needs nobody, so you're uninvited
