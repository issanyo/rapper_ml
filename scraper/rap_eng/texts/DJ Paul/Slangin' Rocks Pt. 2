[Verse 1: Playa Fly]
Slangin' rocks, non-stop, sewin' up my fuckin' block
SPV is where I stay, I'm pushin' on them cracker rocks
Creepin' out the cut with my yam, now Fly want some hay
Stroll up to the chinese store, holler at my nigga Kay
Now Fly got that hay and slangin' rocks is on my fuckin' mind
Tr-izz-ick on the track with no p-izz-ack
Catch up with yo kind
I'm headin' down South Park Way
With my cr-izz-ack in my fuckin' hand
Gangsta hit a nigga straight
Now boat loads what I'm boomin' man
Sewin' up the junkies cause I keep 'em fiendin' for a hit
Servin' kids and twenty strongs
Cause hoe I'm 'bout my business
Standin' on the tr-izz-ack and you know a Playa lookin' fresh
Tommy shirt, Tommy shorts, my nigga sport that fuckin' (?)
When I'm 'bout my haul killa Fly has no fuckin' pity
Get up on the sn-izz-ow hoe and have you bustas feelin' shitty
Boomin' fuckin' h-izz-its to you bustas til I reach the top
No matter how too high Fly get
I'm still gon' slang them fuckin' rocks

[Hook: Buckshotz]

[Verse 2: Playa Fly]
Chillin' in the park, slangin' rocks, it's damn near noon day
Standin' in the shade, it's hot as fuck but hoe we chiefin' hay
Peepin' on my locs, I see the signal from a fuckin' fiend
I ball across the str-izz-eet, go and hit that hoe for her fifteen
5-0s rollin' fuckin' hard, you know a Playa won't be barred
If Fly catch you slippin' bitch I'm gonna pull yo fuckin' card
Dopeheads fiendin' for a hit, call them junkies on that shit
If you ain't got money bitch then get the fuck up off Fly dick
Keep on bring me fuckin' ends, cash yo wellfare ch-izz-eck in
Fuck yo folks, buy this dope, spin with Mr. I-b-n
I-b-n in the lab, growin' off a quarter slab
If Fly ass starts goin' out I front a busta with some bab
(?) , Gangsta V and my niggas Psycho Panic
Taught Fl-izz-y 'bout slangin' hard in this dope (?) game
Finished up my serve on, now you know I'm out it hard
SPV and Triple 6, yeah we down with slangin' rocks

[Bridge: Playa Fly]
Lil Fly comin' out hard for the '94
I-b-n in the wind, I-b-n in the wind
Lil Fly comin' out hard for the '94
I-b-n in the wind, I-b-n in the wind

[Verse 3: Playa Fly]
Quarter key get a nigga straight on them fuckin' yam
Now I'm headin' down South Park, now it's time to do it man
Servin' up my junkies
Cause you now Lil Fly gon' keep 'em straight
And if they ain't got money then I hit 'em til another day
Then they comin' back and you they payin' interest jack
Twenty on the forty and you know they keep 'em comin' back
I'm laid back in the cut, servin' fuckin' f-izz-iends up
Gotta keep 'em fiendin' for them motherfuckin' monkey nuts
I'm hit it off the cut and a bl-izz-unt in my fuckin' hand
My crack rocks in my fuckin' stash
And that's how Fly gon' do it man
5-0 creepin' down my fuckin' street, Fly don't give a fuck
Fuck them folks, Fly buck them folks
Cause Lil Fly just don't give a fuck
I told you once before, if you try to test my fuckin' nuts
Bitch Fly ain't no hoe, you know the score
You cannot fuck with us
Us: me and the motherfuckin' niggas who I hang with
But when Fly break the law
Hoe them crack rocks who I'm slangin' with
