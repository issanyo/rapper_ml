[Intro: Gangsta Blac]
Lock, lock you in the fucking trunk
While I hit the fucking bong
Now, now I'm going crazy man
All I see is blood
Lock, lock you in the fucking trunk
While I hit the fucking bong
Now, now I'm going crazy man
All I see is blood

[Hook: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Tie 'em, tie 'em to my bumper, drug 'em, fuck 'em
I don't love 'em, dump 'em, slump 'em
Put 'em, put 'em in a hoe spot
Take me to the stash pot
Tie 'em, tie 'em to my bumper, drug 'em, fuck 'em
I don't love 'em, dump 'em, slump 'em
Put 'em, put 'em in a hoe spot
Take me to the stash pot

[Verse 1: Koopsta Knicca]
Well I'm fresh up outta jail with no job, so I steal and rob
Creeping through them parks
And running them bitches up out them boulevards
This that type of shit that'll make you click to get your ass in
(Well, what you want, playa?)
Bitch them mothafuckin' dividends
I'm that nigga to envy with, that damn devil in me
Koopsta's bucking these bitches down
Leaving they mothafuckin' pockets empty
That's what I did and now I got a fucking bloody Glock
From making these niggas lay drop yourself
I'm taking these bitches off to my stash pot
And when I step damn fool best to watch yourself
Cause walking with that Koopsta Knicca's bad
For your fucking health
Hoe I would rather make a stang than be a lame burglar
And if I do ya, it's a murder, murder, murder, murders
Inside the mind of a mothafuckin' lunatic
Leaving bitches headless it's pathetic to try to fuck with this
That's why I make these hits and call this shit a nigga knock
*Bang, bang, bang* Bitch don't let this be a stash pot

[Hook: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Tie 'em, tie 'em to my bumper, drug 'em, fuck 'em

Tie 'em, tie 'em to my bumper, drug 'em, fuck 'em
I don't love 'em, dump 'em, slump 'em
Put 'em, put 'em in a hoe spot
Take me to the stash pot
Tie 'em, tie 'em to my bumper, drug 'em, fuck 'em
I don't love 'em, dump 'em, slump 'em
Put 'em, put 'em in a hoe spot
Take me to the stash pot
Tie 'em, tie 'em to my bumper, drug 'em, fuck 'em
I don't love 'em, dump 'em, slump 'em

Take me to the stash pot

[Verse 2: Koopsta Knicca]
5-O's on my dick now tell me bitch what am I supposed to do
Some trick must have snitched
About that Koopsta Knicca robbing fools
I never break a sweat
In the presence of a mothafuckin' redneck
A high speed chase is in effect
Wrap a scarf around my dead dress
Stolen Chevy balling in with the 450 in this mothafuckin' bitch
Plus I'm laying down niggas
5-O bitches they can't fuck with this
Turned the corner
Thinking I'm gonna lay these tricks in a body bag
And could this be the end of the Koopsta Knicca in a ski mask
Ask me if I'm Dracula, I'll tell ya time I'm fucked up
Victims of my fucking stang
Got a trunk filled with the mega buck
He lies on my fucking side shaking paranoid and shit
So I just put an end to that *pop* scary bitch
Cockpiles at his side plus I'm ruthless by my damn self
Plus hanging with the Koopsta Knicca's bad
For your fucking health
Getting up outta my haul killa stealing, this is pimp shit
Really 'bout my business, trick, dropping niggas off in my stash pot
