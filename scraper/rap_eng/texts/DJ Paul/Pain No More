Jelly Roll:
15 years old he's so cool so smooth and does good in school
He made the honor roll so his mom said she would buy him shoes
She dropped him off at the mall said i love you I'll be back at 5
But yellow crime tape surrounded the scene whenever she arrived
She fell to her knees and she screamed and she pleaded and screamed as she cried
She looked to the lord askin' why and she heard a voiced reply

Chorus:
He won't feel that pain no more
He won't feel that pain no more
He won't feel that pain no more
He won't feel that pain no more
Life's about to change may never be the same
He won't feel that pain no more
Jelly Roll:
14 years old and alone in a zone in a cold cold world
She pregnant so now there's a baby that's havin' a baby girl
We told her we loved her we hugged her and said nothing is going to change
The baby was born he was cold and they found out the child had aids
She fell to her knees and she screamed and she pleaded and screamed as she cried
She looked to the lord askin why and she heard a voiced reply

Chorus:
She won't feel that pain no more
She won't feel that pain no more
She won't feel that pain no more
She won't feel that pain no more
Life's about to change may never be the same
She won't feel that pain no more
Jelly Roll:
A little bit older and he ain't been sober since he was a teen
They called him a junky a bluntky?? a crackhead and called him a fiend
He went to church for the first time he'd been in almost 30 years
The preacher was preachin', the spirit had grabbed him and filled him with tears
He fell to his knees and he screamed and he pleaded and screamed and he cried
He said Jesus Christ will you come in my life and he heard this reply

Chorus:
You won't feel that pain no more
You won't feel that pain no more
You won't feel that pain no more
You won't feel that pain no more
Life's about to change may never be the same
She won't feel that pain no more
