You scared ho

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Bustin with that 45 make them bitches back it up
Catch them riding on them thangs make them bitches jack it up
Hitty got the pot maine make them bitches back it up
Finally got that money maine make them bitches sack it up
Take it to the spot maine now it's time to crank it up
Don't play tomorrow brand new day I got to pack it up
That means I got to be the first on the block I got to rack it up
Pocket full of stones so boy I got to track it up
Fuckin with them snitches maine make me want to hang it up
But looking at a empty plate make want to keep it up
Then that nigga who you with you work make me want to creep it up
Though my pockets done got deep ain't got deep enough
Wishing I can rob me a bank but I ain't thief enough
I keep it in the hood to rob a nigga try to steep enough
And it's bout the time I get my bags and then I need it up
Time to find another boy time to get re it up re it up

Kickin in the doe I make them bitches hit the floor for keys
Riding Crown Vic with 23's just because of these
Triple 6 mafia niggas with this units in the back of me
My baller piece snautin dry mouth fucking falculty
Thinking I'mma get it we went and caused a tragedy
Keeping them niggas with they hands out my B-I-Z-B-A-T
Niggas got them toys and we gone to play with them
Feeling fuckin cleanse to the top so we gone spray with them
Fucking them dikes in 2000 maine them bitches better lay it down
If they stop and stutter maine they gone to make a nigga clown
Boy you them cheese we these knifes and we gone to get a slice
Fallin across town showing out right here you gone to pay the price
Use our own nigga how you figga that this wouldn't come
Had a chance to front me one but now you got face my gun face my gun
Black a man it's time for you count it out
Nigga said it out lights out bitch time is out ho
