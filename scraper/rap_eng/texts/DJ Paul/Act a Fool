But if a sucka touch me
Best believe it's on
Get cracked crush your dome
With a bottle of patron

Quick, fast in a hurry
Hit the sucka so hard

Figured it would happen
So I brought my team for this

[Verse 3: Juicy J]

Smokin' purpleish

Girl between my legs
Doin' me up like a licourish

Get your braided hair wig split
Back up off in my chevy
Brains blown out peanut butter
Ridin' high stay high
