[Intro]
"He's a monster
Pure psychopath"
"Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies from their victims"
"I didn't"
"No. No, you ate yours"

[Verse 1]
Sacred Black Magic from the deadly Voodoo Powers
Secret s√©ances performed at midnight hours
Mystic Styles of the ancient mutilations
Horrifying chaos, shackle zombies in me basement
The evil Lord Infamous will take the damn replacement
For the one called Satan when he's up on his vacation
"Thou shalt not kill" the description in the scripture
Me murder me more victims than the one called Adolf Hitler
People want to live but they know we cannot stand it
Want to blow up every motherfucker on this planet
If you try to catch up better we introduce in the attic
Tryin' to enter apartments while we perform devious deeds of black magic
Death shall be your fate when you wish to stop me madness
The Triple 6 Mafia we'll burn your ass to ashes
Shooting the poisonous venoms of terror, injecting into your blood vessels
Remember you fuckin' with the Triple 6, you fuckin' with the curse of the wicked black devils
Damn I'm crazed

[Verse 2]
I talk to myself 'cause there is no one to talk to
I am the cool damn fool that will shoot you
I think of murda, murder on me mind-ah
Murder on the menu, murder all the time-ah
Murder with the .45, murder with the nine-ah
Murder, a murder is my favorite crime-ah
Blood on my street and blood on my hands-ah
Blood on my shirt and blood on my pants-ah
Niggas they die, many die, die, die niggas
I pull the trig-, pull the trig-, pull the trigger
Let's dig a grave, dig a grave, the gravediggers
Six, to the six, to the six Mafia Niggas
Come walk with me, journey to the edge of hell-ah
Firearms, firestorms, bring your umbrella
Indo's creating illusions of creature, the unknown, amazed
Damn I think I'm Crazed
