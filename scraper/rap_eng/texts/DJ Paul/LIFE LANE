[VERSE 1: LAST HOPE IN DA WORLD]
The crosses lane is falling
But deeps don't taking them
Hopes is falling again
Gods abonding every request
You looking in the black mirror
Seein' nothing
But shitty lie
Of maniacs that slowly killing you
Prove yourself tha' you can fight
But youâ€™ll sit tight
When they took all that you have
Just sit tight
Till' you won't fall into grave
With depressed eyes
I hate that shit, I hate that life

[Hook: DJ Paul]
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you, this for all you
Playa hataz who be talkin' that shit (talkin' that shit)
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you, this for all you
Playa hataz who be talkin' that shit (talkin' that shit)
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you, this for all you
Playa hataz who be talkin' that shit (talkin' that shit)
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you, this for all you
Playa hataz who be talkin' that shit (talkin' that shit)

[VERSE 2: HANGMAN]
Crimson web of culture giving new stabs
We losing the parts of mind
How far must we go
If everything just fucking drowning
In same pit's
Just keep hiding your blade
And cut your skin day by day
Hide every scar
Hide the blood on the sleeve
But firstly, give me promise
When the end comes
You will cut your fucking neck from ear to ear
