[Project Pat]
They locked me up just like 2Pac and I went plat-ti-num
Laid it down for a calendar I'm right back at them
Took my game then weighed it up on a triple beam
Niggas rob kill steal for the ghet-ty green
U.S.. Marshal at my folks house want to kill me dead
Wanna see me in a pine box bullet in my head
I'm was like "I ain't did shit why you hatin this?"
Ghetto thugs know my rap songs they relate to this

[DJ Paul]
I been doin this too long to still be strugglin livin like this
Fuckin off with major labels slayed me like a bitch
And these got cheese and ride on Rolls it mean hoes
But still on the road doin free shows
Tryna get a few spins in a few spots
I growed up back in the day I wouldn't use my Glock
I hear a lotta corny shit on the radio
Thats because they record company wouldn't spend dough
Yeah my label got a hook up wit MTV
But they just keep forgettin to tell 'em bout me
They try to play like it's love and its family
But all my marketing dollars goin to {****}
Tear Da Club Up was the first Crunk fight song
I made that in 92 a lil not long
That it took 10 million sold and we still ain't on
That's why Three 6 is the MOst Known Unknowns...
