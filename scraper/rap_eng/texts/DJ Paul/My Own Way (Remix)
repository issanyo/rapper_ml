[Intro]
Three 6 Ma-fi-UHH~! (whoahh-ohh) Good Charlotte
Hypnotize Minds, dat executive (wooo!)
Some real shit man, let's drop it
Let's go!

[Chorus: Good Charlotte]
You know I can't live my life, workin no 9 to 5
No matter what they say, I'm doin it my own way
Cause time ain't on my side, and they don't understand
Forget what people say, I'm doin it my own way

[Verse One] + (Good Charlotte)
So many shysters in my ears fool, tryin to pop it
On my new fame, they will put new hands in my pocket
Standin in the rain buck in hand man, about to cock it
I take another one they wanna be up out the rocket
I cain't understand why they even wanna see me broke (whoahh-ohh)
Wanna see me choke off my own blood from cuttin my throat
I always wanted the money; fame wasn't worth my while
That's why I wore a mask on the front of "Mystic Stylez" (doin it my own way)
But one night in March, {?} my life changed in a sec
Whether for better or for worse I can't answer that yet
But I'll go to the pen before I lose my ends
Murder one, one of you hoes tryin to get me for my Benjamins

[Chorus]

[Verse Two] + (Good Charlotte)
Real talk~!
In the field, it's real, slip up, get killed
Get robbed, get stuck, get messed off in a deal
These kids, are gone, on meth, and pills
That's why, I pack, I carry, the steel
I'm posted, in the hood, got green, I'm good (whoahh-ohh)
Trap house, no doubt, is where, I stood
Got guap, got hot, 'til shop, got popped
These snitches, time cuts, it won't, ever stop (doin it my own way)
The times ain't gon' change change long as cocaine 'caine
Goes up the nose nose fries a nigga brain brain
See 'em in the mornin time tryin to catch a train train
Back out on the block block doin the same thang thang

[Chorus]

[Good Charlotte]
Whoahhhhhhhh...
Doin it my own way {*fades out*}
