[Chorus: Playa Fly sample]
Front a busta with some bab
Get that hoe for her fifteen

[Verse 1]
My niggas Skinny, Gin and Scarecrow's
Always gettin' they fuckin' duck sicked
When I get to fuckin' my hoes
I'm dumpin' them trizzick like down in a ditch
Paul he get them groupie hoochies
Runnin' to that purple thang
Lil Fly slangin' dope and 'caine
Stay about that hustle mane
Crunchy Black keep sweatin' that dope track
Got them junky bitches comin' back
Then he got that gat
Let that shit ka-rat-a-tat with that
Blood all on my cross
Cuz a nigga bit the dust
Seasonly I pop the slug
Bitch the Koopsta Knicca don't give a fuck
I read the Revelation, think about my situation
Waitin' on a low wage job but in my heart I have no patience
Call up my nigga friend to hit 'em with a (?) ten
I had to touch 'em, had to stick 'em for them dividends
And barred them niggas up out my hood
And send a fuckin' shot
Who called the folks? Who called the feds?
Who called the fucking cops?
Oh well, I won't be sittin' up in a jail cell
To make my pockets swell I make you bitches burn in hell

[Chorus: Playa Fly sample]
Front a busta with some bap
Get that hoe for her fifteen

[Bridge]
Get that hoe for...
Front a busta...
Get that hoe for...
Front a busta...

[Verse 2]
Nigga should finna be droppin' the green
I be down with the Koopsta ain't comin' clean
I'm makin' them stangs, I'm splittin' they brains
I'm droppin' these bitches off somethin' mane
Bitches be testin' my pimpin'
As if I really was a babbage nigga
Comin' straight outta that North for real-la
The Koopsta Knicca's a cap peela
Though I'm not like dracula
Bitch this time it's a psycho man
The bloody Glock mister
Blood stuck in the chest bitch
The Koopsta the Knicca's a scandalous
Winter, spring, summer, fall oh fella
I'm creepin' in all types of weather
Knockin' these tricks in like down in a ditch
Break a bitch quick, I love this shit
I break my fuckin' black back
Slangin' crack up on that dope track
A bitch tried to keep my shit
Trick so I dropped off something like that
That bizness with that sh-izz-it
L-izz-ead caliber nigga d-izz-ick
Murder-murder, redruM, body numb
In a ditch trick with a bunch of
Bitches wrapped up in some plastic
They got blasted
I take yo shit and sorry bitch
You gets no fuckin' casket
Nothin' but some bullet lead
Stuck in your motherfuckin' head
Triple 6 engraved in red
Got you busta bitches scared

[Bridge]
Get that hoe for...
Front a busta...
Get that hoe for...
Front a busta...

[Chorus: Playa Fly sample, until end]
Front a busta with some bap
Get that hoe for her fifteen
