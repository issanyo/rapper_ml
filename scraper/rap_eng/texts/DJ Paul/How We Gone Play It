[Intro: DJ Paul]
Whassup nigga?
Crunchy bust on that hoe!
Koop bust on that nigga!
Whats up now niggas?
Lord bust on that nigga!
Boo grab that hoe, nigga!
(DJ Paul, J-Green, Shawty Trap on track)
Y'all know what the fuck it is nigga
Mafia 6ix up in this motherfucker
Guns out, blazin'
Light your whole motherfuckin' hood up hoe
Y'all already know what it is
Bitch

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Nigga say it, that's how we gon' play it
(?) chop the bullets at yo motherfuckin' head
And if you talk about it; I hope you be about it
Cause I won't hestitate to hit a nigga like that (?)

[Verse 1: Koopsta Knicca]
This a kick door
Rowdy, rowdy pistol
Koopsta, Scarecrow
Y'all hoes don't know yo
Bitch tagged too
Sippin' lean don't make 'em hard
Ripped his ass apart
Left 'em dead from the start bitch
Murder's in my mind
Sharin' dead bodies ...
How ... bitch when nobody never asked me
Now scar on leg (?) we (?)
RedruM, bodies numb, this song, Vietnam

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
I got that mask to my fucking face; I'm fiendin'
I'm 'bout to click up on that bitch without a reason
Hey, what you bitches wanna do?
Since you out here talking shit
If you wanna run into this click come get yo wig split
This ain't what you want my nig
I need that dope, I need to smoke
Crazy lady never barrin' bitches
When she full of coke
(Did she say she full of coke?)
Yea that's what I said young nigga
(?) finger (?) the trigger and ready to put it up in ya

[Hook: DJ Paul]

[Bridge: DJ Paul/Beat Change]
YA! What the fucks up nigga?
We got guns out
Change the motherfuckin' beat up

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
Yeah
I stay comin' with that hard shit, but I don't start shit
These niggas wanna be with this icon how I run it
Bitch I got a click thick as hell
All my niggas goin' to hell, but it's okay
Havin' them came from there any-fucking-way
Got some niggas from the M with cases on first 48
Got some killas from L.A. that'll gun down your whole face
We don't give a motherfucking fuck about your fucking race
... is all it take of your fucking face, fucker!

[Verse 4: Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
Step into my domicile, throw your body on the pile
Scarecrow from the bloody nile, vicious, wicked reptile
Rabid warewolf on the prowl, make this millimeter growl
Ready for my murder trial, lyrical black belt, tap 'em out
Sick sadistic mojo, madness in the dojo
Blow yo chitlins out your 'fro, shoot you in the goddamn toe
Put you in the pine box, strong as an iron ox
Carbin burnin' red hot, knock you out your fuckin' socks

[Beat Change]
