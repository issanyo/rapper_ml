[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
The Devil's Daughter
I'm 'bout to make stang that's gon' be sweet
Sweet robbery, a mystery that makes the police think
For testin' the pimpin' of a Mrs. Gangsta like this lady Boo
Now hoe I thought you knew, I thought you knew
I thought you knew that Memphis thick
So stupid bitch why would you wanna test us
We strapped with artillery, makin' you jump, some duck
Some niggas fucked, oh that' so fucked up
Cause my brother I didn't wanna hurt you
But nigga shut up, cause you fucked up with the Gangsta Boo
Called Crunchy Black to see how can this stang be made
Then he said "(?) this nigga mane I got that shit (?)"
This shit is on, I put the tone up in my pants and jet
Jet to the nigga with the shit so now this shit are set
Clicked up so slick with Triple 6, don't think I love you man
Man nigga please I want yo cheese, now can't you understand
This perfect shit, a gangsta bitch that sets you niggas up
So think before you splurge yo shit
Cause if you don't you fucked

[Verse 2: Crunchy Black]
It's Crunchy Black the demon child, another mystery made
Another stang, Boo set it up, another nigga in his grave
I'm constantly scopin' out you niggas with that bible shit
You think I'm straight, bitch I ain't straight
I'm out to get your shit
My Smith & Wesson teaches lessons for you hard head hoes
To drop it off you won't feel pain unless you don't do as told
But if you got yo fuckin' pistol and you think you can beat
The Three 6 Mafia, nigga try ya luck and we will see
But it's more likely you lose your life and I'm in the wind
I'm smokin' out, I'm livin large off all them dividends
The devil told me I can get away with all yo shit
An angel said "Don't make him turn you, (?) lunatic"
Since Triple 6 is in my blood you know the devil right?
Paul scooped me up in a Chevy thang, we dodgin' all blue light
We so, so (?) we smokin' out our whole motherfuckin' crew
We show no love for lemon suckers, trick I thought you knew
