[Intro]
He's a monster
Pure psychopath
Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies from their victims
I didn't
No. No, you ate yours

[Hook: Lord Infamous]
Damn I think, damn I think, damn I think, I'm crazed
Damn I think, damn I think, damn I think, I'm crazed
Damn I think, damn I think, damn I think, I'm crazed
Damn I think, damn I think, damn I think, I'm crazed

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Sacred Black Magic from the deadly Voodoo Powers
Secret s√©ances performed at midnight hours
Mystic Styles of the ancient mutilations
Horrifying chaos, shackle zombies in me basement
The evil Lord Infamous will take the damn replacement
For the one called Satan when he's up on his vacation
"Thou shalt not kill" the description in the scripture
Me murder me more victims than the one called Adolf Hitler
People want to live but they know we cannot stand it
Want to blow up every motherfucker on this planet
If you try to catch up better we introduce in the attic
Tryin' to enter apartments
While we perform devious deeds of black magic
Death shall be your fate when you wish to stop me madness
The Triple 6 Mafia we'll burn your ass to ashes
Shooting the poisonous venoms of terror
Injecting into your blood vessels remember
You fuckin' with the triple six
You fuckin' with the curse of the wicked black devils
Damn I'm crazed

[Hook: Lord Infamous]
Damn I think, damn I think, damn I think, I'm crazed
Damn I think, damn I think, damn I think, I'm crazed
Damn I think, damn I think, damn I think, I'm crazed
Damn I think, damn I think, damn I think, I'm crazed

[Verse 2: D.J. Paul]
Glock 19 in the stash spot of the cutlass
These niggas don't want no problems with me
These haters they way too gutless, they nutless
Can't fuck with, my Triple Six
Mafia and they know the shit
Every time we do a show in the town, nigga we way too thick
Think its a motherfuckin' [?]
You niggas are too far behind to catch up
Even if I was nice [?]
No more leisure's, nomore  talk, just run up on they ass and leave 'em with chalk
[?]
I'm pullin' out AKs, like its a Mayday
[?]
Blow up your fuckin' face and I won't hesitate
Unload the clip, niggas know I'ma regulate
Bitch

[Hook: Lord Infamous]
Damn I think, damn I think, damn I think, I'm crazed
Damn I think, damn I think, damn I think, I'm crazed
Damn I think, damn I think, damn I think, I'm crazed
Damn I think, damn I think, damn I think, I'm crazed
