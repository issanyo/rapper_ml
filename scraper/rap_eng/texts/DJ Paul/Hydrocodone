Eighty, eighty-four Brougham on them blades, 20 inch chrome
Hydrocodone on that hands free phone
Eighty, Eighty-four Brougham on them blades, 20 inch chrome
If you got sixteen, you can, you can get a bizzird
I'm chokin' on that doja sweet and sippin' on that sizzurp
Hydrocodone, hydro, hydrocodone
Eighty, eight-four Brougham, eighty, eight-four Brougham
Hydro, hydrocodone, hydro, hydrocodone

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Sip away the yellow thickness,  Tussionex time-release medicine
It po' slow as molasses with a texture like some gelatin
Codeine got me elegant, no other high is better than
Purple promethazine if you peddle it then sell me it
Keep that orange and green, I rather fuck off with that red
Rather have yellow and purple instead, and nod my head
Get that crushed ice, Jolly Ranchers, two foam cups
I put four in the cranberry grape, it's froze when I pour it up

[Verse 2: Crunchy Black]
I got sixteen bars, I got sixteen clowns
I got sixteen flavors, I got sixteen pounds
I got sixteen tabs, I got sixteen hoes
I got sixteen flavors, I got sixteen foe
I got sixteen blunts, rolled up that stanky stank
And I walk real slow cause I'm full of that drank
Don't you talk too fast, you gon' make a nigga think
What the fuck you sayin'? Cause I'm gone off that drank
I got...

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
Sittin' in my room, candles burnin', sippin' sizzurp
Poppin' on a Roxie, cause my body fuckin' h-izz-urt
A nigga just poured it all week up
High as satellites, you thought I was a decor
I don't like that orange syrup that make me itch too much
But I'll go to town off two liter of that purple Tuss'
R.I.P to Lord Infamous and Pimp C
I know you boys up in heaven gettin' muddy

[Verse 4: Charlie P.]
Two-liter poured up, that bih dirty as fuck
Two deep, rolled up in my burner
White bitch, she hit the coke, then ride me like a roller coaster
Sucked the dick like a champion (What) No hands, got ghost
Gone off that drank, same color in my pint
It's that dirty muddy water that'll make a nigga faint
Get a pack of them beans in the pocket of my jeans
Pulled a juug for 40 racks, split it all with the team

[Paul Wall]
R.I.P Pimp C ... Big Moe, we're gonna pour it extra muddy for you ... My main fo's all chrome with Vogue tires, cuff wood ... Paul Wall, po-up boy... two cups

[Verse 5: Paul Wall]
I'm chokin' on that Swisher Sweet and sippin' potent
Crawling like a rodent, swangers pokin', candy coated
Pop a Soma, got that drank extra muddy, foamin'
Watch my cup, you better not spill it, that's a bad omen
Pull up in the Cadillac and everybody watchin'
Eatin' Norcos and Watson's, feelin' quite awesome
Playin' possum, passin' out
Kush squares we passin' out
Smoke a rather large amount
Cashin' out and mashin' out
White and yellow, feelin' mellow, codeine with Tylenol
Sittin' in my comfort zone cause if I'm stand and walk, I fall
Liver full of alcohol, if you blow my high we brawl
Blow mo' money at the pharmacy than you spend at the mall
Paul Wall and DJ Paul, new drank, I tried it all
Karo in yo cup, have you runnin' to the bathroom stall
You gettin' throwed, no stallin' the prices of Paul
And two hundred a line for that real purple is real ballin' baby

[Verse 6: Koopsta Knicca]
Hydrocodone, bitch
Sizzurp is the song, bitch
Sippin' 'til I'm noddin', bitch
Pass the Don Juan, bitch
My niggas be on that coke
Catchin' drains down they throat
High beam, soarin' hoe
Peekin' out my window
Syrup got me movin' slow
Laid back, calm flow
Where I get it from hoe?
Rio de Janeiro!
(??)
Bunch of (?), bunch of yellow
Now pour it in my cup, hoe!
Pour it in my cup, hoe!
Pour it in my cup, hoe!
Pour it in my cup, hoe!
Pour it in my cup, hoe!
