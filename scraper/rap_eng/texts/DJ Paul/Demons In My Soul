[Unfinished Lyrics]

[Intro]
DJ Paul in this mothafucka
With my nigga Lil Gin, the Serpent's Stepson
Don't forget to be on the look-out for the new Three-6 Mafia album, Mystic Stylez
It's gonna be onnn, biatch..

[Verse 1: 211]
Rollin' bowls in the tables[?]
Honeycomb dip[?]
I reach into my glove compartment for that duel clip
Yalk on my left, one hand on that point...grain[?]
Ballin' ...ize[?], steady floatin' in the rain
Punchin' up seven digits on the Motorola
As I continue sippin' on Remy Martin and soda
This nigga's crossed me out, now this gat's finna get pulled[?]
I catch this loser, pull up on his ass, big gold grill
Jumpin' out, lookin' serious, lookin' for that trick
And If I find his ass, I got a ditch for that punk bitch
It's been a while since my gauge been crunkin' bodies in the trunk
And mothafucka's bounce, smellin' like a skunk
There that nigga go, "I heard you runnin' yo cocksucka"
He reached, and I burned 'em leavin' chest wounds, you stupid fuck, yea
Your blood is spilled, I thought you knew I was jackin' home
Numerous slams behind the trigga, bitch, screamin' demons in my soul..

[Rasta-T]
Suckah keep on pullin' that knife up on me, ah POM POM!
Gonna shoot that suckah dead with da gun, so POM POM!
(yeah rigghhtt~)
Stupid ass dope-fiend with da Yoga-Tun[?], so POM POM!
[?]..dirty ass want to play me dumb[?], so POM POM!
Cause we..

[Verse 2: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Rollin' through my hood, with the ...[?]crop top-drop
Chiefin' a quarter pound of pot
In my lap with the Glock cocked
For the niggas, who disrespect
Pimpin' they continue, they sweat me
For the dumb shit
Now I gotta pop a bitch
Laws know I'm dirty, though
Snitches droppin' off info
I got the two keys, plus a gat
Fillin' up out[?] my 5.O
Runnin' down tha ride of breath[?]
To the Dope House on the prairie
Jumped into some ...[?] oes
Tempted[?] from the scenery
Even though they pulled my car, I report it stolen first
Then they trace my phone call, situation's gettin' worse
Sirens comin' from the South, the East, and the West
Now it's best to fade to the North, Memphis
Where the niggas just
Love to bust a hot one in a crooked coppa's fuckin' face
Fuck Rodney King, he sprayed a mace
Bitch, I sprayed a gauge
Before I'm locked up, let the mortuary keep me cold
Never considered me cool
My enemy feared me, serpent's in my soul..
