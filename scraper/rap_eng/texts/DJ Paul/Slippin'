[Chorus: Koopsta Knicca sample]
Evertime I see you slippin' - Mac 10, Mac 10...

[Verse: Koopsta Knicca]
Damn I'm about to bust a cap up in these trizzicks crest
I'm thinkin' deadly and I'm scopin' with that infrared
Kickin' with the hardest click
Nigga bodies rottin' up in them ditches
Man what's a bone when my tone hits like a ton of brizzicks
Koops not concerned
I let you burn and burn and burn
Everything in the prophecy has been demonically read
So I learned
Deep in the morgue lies corpses in the quarters
They wanna face in a line of order
Can you place this shit
When you crawled up on the red man
You bounce set up in this bitch
Sittin' man and thinkin'
Though inside of my dreams I hear little kids screamin
Poor preachers are waiting for hangings
Which got me like bored in the psycho ward daily
The 6-6-6 mystery man it's takin' me straight to insanity
Could it be a dimension of witches that bring out the forces to issue more tragedies
The seas of cries will soon be turning your fuckin' life over
Left the priest and island bleeding on a four leaf clover
Then I equip enough of these slugs
Got the skull on my wall as I grab the big mug
To drink up a pint of his blood

[Chorus: Koopsta Knicca sample]
Evertime I see you slippin' - Mac 10, Mac 10...

Victims of my devils playground
