Powder get you hyper, get you hyper
Get you hype, get you, get you, get you hyper
(5x)

Verse 1: Lil' E
This is strictly for you niggas that need to really hear the fuckin' truth
Bout why you saw Lil E take a chew and chew on some ah that flaky fruit
Mane I hope you brace yourself before we take this bumpy ride
Cause you about to see the Lil E while he's on that wild side
I'm not playin' no game like some of these other niggas like to do
You lookin' a bit serious while I'm snortin' some ah that god damn toot
Just like I said before don't test my pimpin' while I'm on that white
Weed ain't nuthin' but something to slow my roll
The powder get's me hype
Now the powder got some size a bump that'll make you feel superb
Like Montana did when he went down to snort it up out dat bird
Some of y'all niggas out there snort a pack or two and think you straight
You ain't gettin' peel'd 'less it's nothing less you wanna get ate
Balls stacked tall, and don't stall is what I'm all about
When I'm goin' to coke, don't play I'm gettin' p'd out
Ain't no fuckin' around when it come to the dope
Cocaine got me addicted nigga hurry up and pass the dope

Hook:

Powder get you hyper
Numb, numb; cocaine got me addicted nigga pass the blow
Powder, powder get you hyper
Numb, numb;  cocaine got me addicted nigga pass the blow
Powder, powder get you hyper
Numb, numb;  cocaine got me addicted nigga pass the blow
Powder, powder get you hyper
Numb, numb;  cocaine got me addicted nigga pass the blow

Verse 2: Lil' E

Causin' all that mayhem when I'm hostile, bout a lil somethin' mane
Specially when I'm full ah some ah that grass and some ah that cocaine
Now don't let me have a few ah them pills on poppin' down my throat
Mane it feels so good when mixin' it wid some ah that goddamn coke
Definitely how this big boy like to do it when I like to get
Full ah that fuckin' phonk and ink and syrup yeh that's the shit
Takin' that god damn fight strap with that bright is how I'll always be
Blowin' on nothin' less than some of the best of that old potent leaf
I can't think of no other way to do it except the playa way
Constantly buyin' some tissue cause yo nose be blunted from that bay
Sneezin', coughin', drainin' all that comes with blowin' that fire ass hoe
Have a blow out with Lit' E and I bet you'd want to quit that dope
Go in' like the Energizer bunny 24-7 mack
I'm one of them big ballers steadily breakin' out them pitcher packs
I done said it once so listen good about the god damn white
When you take that blow you'll find out dat that powder get's you hyped

Hook

Snort, snortin' cocaine got me addicted nigga pass the blow
