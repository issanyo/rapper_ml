[Hook: The Showboys sample]
Drag him from the river, throw him back in Bugs' yard

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Puffin smoke out the gun, just then I watch the niggas bail
Take a deep breath then I let nina exhale
Teflon makes it hard to identify kill
Bump car steamer dump the motherfucking corpse in the potter's fields, arms, .380 chrome crack domes
Sledgehammer swings, then me crush all thee bones
Watch 'em swell, oh well, mane he looks kinda pale
Caught alotta hell, swallow .357 shells
One of my homies tried to warn you my nigga
Hope he got insurance on the damn grave digger
Or did you ever know of niggas with my mentality?
The penitentiary yo, is just a mere formality
Mane Scarecrow life has no meaning so why should yours?
What you gonna do when assassins kickin' down yo doors?
And niggas when ya feel the hot lead in yo liver
I laugh when the one-timers drag you from the river

[Hook: The Showboys sample/Lord Infamous]
Drag him from the river, throw him back in Bugs' yard

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
I jumped in my Cutlass, straight ghost down the back street
Got a bandana and my rifle on the front seat
Me and Scarecrow filled with anna
Getting bout a sneak another peak
Busta finna found floatin' down a muddy creek
With his nuts up his ass, another fucking mega blast
Take his partner out the other car, lay him in the grass
Tie his hands real tight until the rope cut his meat
Take off the blindfold and strap them grey bricks to his feet
Perform a satanic ritual and give all praise
To the great evildoers, squeeze the trizzick in his fuckin' face
Busta motherfucker always talkin' that hard shit
Goin' crazy over these hoes finna get put in a click
By the Killa Man nigga behind the motherfucking trigger
When the 80's pointin' at ya, the coward breath get bigger
The first power lit ya, the .380 hit ya
The M.P.D's found the body decayed in the river

[Hook: The Showboys sample/Lord Infamous]
Drag him from the river, throw him back in Bugs' yard

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
These bitch ass niggas are the type of motherfuckers that like to stare with they eyes
Come on, get this spine stomp till ya paralyzed
Cock Mrs. Nina, spittin' Teflon in yo lungs
You better watch that mouth busta, if you want that tongue
Runnin' 'round town sayin' you won what you win nigga
Mark motherfuckers still ain't got ya ass in nigga
Lord Infamous the maniac, schizophrenic Scarecrow dude
I'm the nigga to fuck with if you wanna be fish food
Pin hits the hollow point hit yo guts and then the slug explode
Place on yo chest, it's a dead red bloody rose
Yo mammy lookin' sad when she see your toe tag
Bullet ate that ass like a Rottweiler gone mad
Niggas pay the cost when they cross the loco boss
Toss what's left of the body in a bloody swamp
Would he? Why would he try to diss my brother fat nigga
Don't get your bad ass thrown in the fuckin river

[Hook: The Showboys sample/Lord Infamous]
Drag 'em from the river, throw 'em back up on the swamp
