I'm from the part of Tennessee called SPV, Spray Pesty Varments
Catch ya busta boy, I beat em; blow em up outta his dorments
Punk ass niggas be tryin ta stick a light up under me, like some ornaments
Don't make me grab the case that's full of the weapons and heavy compartments
Bitch ya killin me, besta be eatin some porridge, you got some courage
Punk motherfucker don't make me go get that there uzi up outta the storage
Bitches, bloody Satan waiting ???
Armageddon soldiers comin to ???

[Crunchy Black]
You trying to be like me, you can't be like me
It's hard ta be me, like them stunts on TV, g
You see me, hustlin, workin my muscle-in
Puttin my 2 cents where it can be trusted-n
You musta been a silly fool
Thinkin you could wear my shoes, damn fool
I walked a mile, I hauked em down
I understand now, why everybody don't wanna frown

[Hook x2]

Dead body parts all froze in my trunk

[Gangsta Boo]
Well all them hoes that used to be down with me

Or am I dreamin the motherfuckers be after me?
Why you tryin ta be like me? You labelled as a wanna-be
You ghetto hoes, you need to read up on this Gangsta Boo
Cuz you might find a tip, bitch, that can help you

Stay around chick
Whenever, however, it's goin down, bitch
