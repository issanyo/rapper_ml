(Busta ass niggas runnin' around with that hoe shit)
Now it's a nigga all on a dick of the 6-double-6

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I'm a niggas worst nightmare, I keep my plans quiet as kept
Motherfuckers (?) the shit you gonna do next
(?) sit back like a mack for the killin' spree
Niggas killin' niggas, that's all a nigga wanna see
I tried to be a doubt ass nigga, never tellin' out
Till motherfuckers started rubbin' my dick
And runnin' their mouth
I heard I did this, did that, (?) sniffin' 'caine
People say I got a big strap and we ran a train
Fuck what ya heard nigga, stay the fuck out my face
Gossip in yo fuckin' mouth gon' make a nigga catch a case
Everytime I see ya in front of ya high school
Tryin' to flag me down, ole nappy head (?) cool
Time for da Juice Mane to go insane
Nigga get real before I put a bullet to yo brain
Cause I'm a nigga that you don't wanna fuck with
So don't come in my face with that hoe shit

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Mafia niggas pull them triggers, blast on a sissy ass
Buck 'em down once, buck 'em down twice (?)
Get (?) when you fall in a blood bath
45 automatic Glock makes you feel the wrath
Criss cross in my path, if you think I'm joking bitch
Bitch motherfuckers spreadin' shit, fall down 6 in a ditch
Switch from this place to that place startin' rumors
Fillin' up the heads of them Killa Man tape consumers
But they can tell the tale and I can tell they get bailed
That's why we rollin' clean and for you it's a dream
To join the Triple 6, tryin' to (?) suck our dick
Because them Triple 6 niggas don't barr none of you tricks
Gl-izz-ock on our hip plus some extra clips
Yo face the face of death when I squeeze on that (?)
And I don't wanna hear shit a nigga said about me
Unless I ask, I'm 'bout to smack yo busta ass nigga
