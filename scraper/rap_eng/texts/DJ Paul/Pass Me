Pass me da mutha-fuckin' blunt mane
Hurry up or else somebody's gonna get sprayed
Cough and choke on the weed is just what I do
Cough and choke on the weed is just what I do

Smoke dis, smoke dat, smoke weed, smoke crack
Everybody gettin' high, high off they fuckin' sac
Everybody know me, know me by Black
Black be smokin' weed mane, smokin' weed by da stack
Got dis, got dat, got swishers, got blacks
Got dat smoked out no doubt, bumpin' on the fuckin' track
Gonna get high mane, roll to get high mane
Smoke till I die mane, ain't no fuckin' thang
I'mma smoke till I die, I'mma break down that swisher

Ain't no smokin' wit me mane, ain't no smokin' wit me mista
