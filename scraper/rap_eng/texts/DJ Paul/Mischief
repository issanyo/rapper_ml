[Hook]
Purple drinks we up to something
Rolling blunts, getting naughty
Naked women, now you talking
Tryna fuck, I'm so horny
Take a dip, let's have a party
Let's get drunk what's up shawty
Watch your back, the reaper's calling
Live your life for the moment

[Verse 1: Azizi Gibson]
I'm chilling with my homies, relaxing with some hoes
I'm tryna hide my stash, someone's knocking at my door
Now I'm looking through the peephole
It's just my nigga with some dro, so I tell him roll that shit up
He says should I use the cones
I said nigga I do not give a fuck no no
As long as your ass rolling up we're good

[Hook]
Purple drinks we up to something
Rolling blunts, getting naughty
Naked women, now you talking
Tryna fuck, I'm so horny
Take a dip, let's have a party
Let's get drunk what's up shawty
Watch your back, the reaper's calling
Live your life for the moment

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Drunker than a motherfucka
High as a mother fucka
Jumping out my Rolls fly i i i as a mother fucka
Smokin on some fire i i i like a mother fucka
Nigga might die i i i like a mother fucka
Hoe put the party already looking like it crunk
And these bitches already looking like they drunk
