Plus I'll double bust, to yo nuts, cough'em up SLUT
Drop the needle and then I'm callin Triple Six up

[Juicy J]

Now everytime you see a player we be high, we be high
So come and get a piece of nigga pie, nigga pie
[Frazer Boy]

So god damn it, you can't stand it, leave you stranded
Push up nigga you been bradin, I been pacin you are facin
Fuckin killer in your placin, heart is racin, y'all be racin
Both to catch another casin, kill and nigga, drill a nigga

[Crunchy Blake]
Nigga let me tell you my specialty, my specialty
Its getting you niggas, lock and load with the gun and pullin the trigger
How the fuck you figure, that a nigga ain't robbin you nigga

How the fuck y'all niggas
Wanna go to war when y'all ain't bad enough for us boy
[DJ Paul]
See I'm the kings of kings, scare crows the lord of us
And fuckin up in my kindom is something you can't afford
Tryin to compete with hypnotize man, I wouldn't even try that
My low keys cost 70 G's nigga can you buy that
You wonder why I had the for sale sign in the yard, bitch I sold my crib
My new house cost 1 million, and this some king shit, mtv crib shit
Yo mouth done dropped, you start to drool you need a bib bitch
Before you dis me nigga turn yo pockets inside out, clean yo shoes and you
Pants bring the starch right out
Cause I'm the K.O.M., you wishin you was down with this click
But you choose other wise so you a clown to this click
In the streets nigga you get nothing but frowns from this click
And we done covered all sides of this country you bitch
So if you ever get a chance to get your source out right
You'll be like me nigga Nas all you'll have is one mic
