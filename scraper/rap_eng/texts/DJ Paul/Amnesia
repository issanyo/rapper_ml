[Intro]
This for the real, this for the fame
I just shift for real, these haters get

[Hook]
Amnesia, have them got amnesia
Them does what is real so I forgot about them people
Whoop a nigga ass then, but I gotta have my ego
My girl looking at, she must forgot I need her
Amnesia, have them got amnesia
Hawl at them, it feels so long, but I gotta have the beamer
Smoke so much weed, I forgot to chose a legal
They remember the last name, a nigga need a re-up

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you a day or two
I got hoes like Uncle Luc
Have them got amnesia like the money, I remember you
Care for nigga with the shit, how quickly do we forget
Forgot your girl, something, that’s a thing you don’t even know she do
Right, that hot girl go, you know how I know
Have your girl up in my shit and you don’t even know
Twenty girls in a jail, get em for no G
Now I know you ain’t got no time, remember me
They are rappy on the ground, niggers know that I ain’t lying
It was up, ain’t got no problem, nigga told they do up nine
Them niggers are used to fucking, what’s the fucking ways to die
Niggers dope, got me catching amnesia, they completely slip my mind

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She eager, riding around on my beamer
I forgot this hoe name, had it call amnesia
She want the man and she want the visa
I forgot my rubbers and she still want me to greeze her
I don’t run like that, but I keep therefore like that
Niggers talking shit, clearly they talk and he forget
Amnesia, guess he got a bad place
Had her call so much I can’t remember what I last drank
Yeah, drinking bottle after bottle
Smoke the best weed, then forget my problems
Got so much money, niggers, we get that from the rappers
I know you niggers scared, so get the step up like a copper
