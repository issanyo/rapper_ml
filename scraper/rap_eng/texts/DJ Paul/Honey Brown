[Verse 1 - Yelawolf]
See, all my life I've been friends with thugs
I never did judge cause my momma sold drugs
By the age of 5 I could hold a beer buzz
All I wanna do is show love to my boys
In the '88 Crown Vic, Rolling deep
Working so hard cause they can't, go to sleep
Got the same clothes that you rock, for three days
Hitting traps like a prophet, for petes sake
To the single mothers in the kitchen still cooking
No job open but shes out, still looking
If you don't, who the fuck will?
Not daddy, cause that mothafucka's not here
So stop askin' for the pennies and the hand-me-outs
You gotta look at life and get it without any doubts
Only a coward has to rob and pull a Semi out
Just to open the garage and pull a Hemi out, think big

[Hook - Yelawolf]
I crack the top and pour the fifth out
I wanna run around the whole wide world
Just me and my girl (Just me and my bitch)
I got a cup full of that Honey Brown
I wanna drank it with the whole wide world
Just me and my girl (Just me and my bitch)

[Verse 2 - Yelawolf]
All my life I've been friends with thugs
I never did judge cause my momma sold drugs
By the age of five I could hold a beer buzz
All I wanna do is show love to my boys
Rocking Mossy Oak, big trucks, lift kits
Waking up before the sun rise, gettin' it
You got them babies that you gotta feed, for christ sake
Put them eighteen wheels on the, highway
I'mma do it for the country bucks, fuckin' right
Got a problem with somebody then, fuckin' fight
Don't be a pussy, homie win some, lose some
Just make sure you make it to the house when it's done
Respect outlives any hollowtip
Pride will get you killed, better learn how to swallow it
To the rappers on the planet out dreaming
Learn how to write a record, homie stop schemin'
Nobody cares about you pocket's with no mics on
Don't be blind to yourself they might gon' be a pipe bomb
Fake shit it's like snail to the salt
In the nail to a coffin, somebody turn the lights on

[Hook - Yelawolf]
I crack the top and pour the fifth out
I wanna run around the whole wide world
Just me and my girl (Just me and my bitch)
I got a cup full of that Honey Brown
I wanna drank it with the whole wide world
Just me and my girl (Just me and my bitch)

[Hook - Yelawolf]
I crack the top and pour the fifth out
I wanna run around the whole wide world
Just me and my girl (Just me and my bitch)
I got a cup full of that Honey Brown
I wanna drank it with the whole wide world
Just me and my girl (Just me and my bitch)
