[Intro]
Yeah, it's on for the 1-9-9-9
Project Pat in this ho
Putting this ghetto bump in ya speaker
Hypnotize done made it
You know the business ho

[Verse]
Breaking down some reefa
Rolling up a sweeta
Riding through the streeta
Cheifing like heata
Reefa got me nizzoid
Object of them blue boys
Searching my vehicle
Breath smell liquor
Mane it's Project Pata
Playa from the sizouth
Always pack the gat-ahh
Gold teeth in my mizouth
Hustle for the cheddarrr
Trying to make it betta
You respect the man
Or you gets a bloody sweat-arr
Down wit' Paul and Juicy
Hypnotize the label
Ho got get off my nutsack
And leggo my eggo
Chopping up keya
Riding on twentyas
Don't you wanna be a
Playa just like me a
Hanging out wit' killas
Creeping on a come up
Like the ones before me
Dog I'm trying to blow up
I don't give a fizuck
Mane I want that cizap
From yo' baby mama
North Memphis on the mizap

[Hook]

Where dem killas hang
