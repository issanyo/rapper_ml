[Hook]
She she she she got gel and weave, gel and weave
She got gel and weave, gel and weave
She got gel and weave, gel and weave
Weave weave in they hair, weed in they purse, still Crunk
She got gel and
Weave, gel and weave
She got gel and weave, gel and weave
She got gel and weave, gel and weave
Wit a big round ass, I'm yo man to be

[Verse 1]
You can put a wig on a pig-a-lig
Make her dance the jig-a-lig
Bring all the money back to Daddy and I'm diggin it
Burgundy or honey blonde
Yellow wit them black streakers, red or they orange plum
Don't forget the gold teethus and set the club half naked
In the sto', house shoes, cussin out authority
Body full of tattoos
Bedroom doin things, stickin out her tongue ring
Livin in the projects, could be in the game
She from the hoody-hood all to the goody-good
Lips and her tongue and it's all understoody-stood
First of the month now your kids on the Similac
Droppin over Mama's house, girl what's crackilackin?
Hookin up with so-called
G-string or no draws
Fingernails, big hips, juicy wet, pink lips
Ready man to do the damn thing at the motel
If you're bang-banging all night she'll go tell

[Hook]
She she she she got gel and weave, gel and weave
She got gel and weave, gel and weave
She got gel and weave, gel and weave
Weave weave in they hair, weed in they purse, still Crunk
She got gel and
Weave, gel and weave
She got gel and weave, gel and weave
She got gel and weave, gel and weave
Wit a big round ass, I'm yo man to be

[Verse 2]
Baldhead scallywag, wit nothin in back
You better yak it, ten dollar for a bag
Messed up in the trash
Could be some Kanekalon
Dude who done sold it at the boot liquor lawn
All to the good though, drankin' like a wino
And smoke till she pass out, mainly the hydro
Her stay in a cafe
All up in LD's, or the biz Twilight, you know what I like
Hey duck she gon break somethin
Turn around and make some
Meet a real nigga anywhere she'll shake somethin
Like shoutin out 'cause her butt like an elephant
Got a real girl dog, that is irrelevant
A mage a twa twa, she'll call me DaDa
Or maybe PaPa in back of car car
Her friend can join in, go snap that porn in
Call Mr. Hit where a playa was born in

[Hook]
She she she she got gel and weave, gel and weave
She got gel and weave, gel and weave
She got gel and weave, gel and weave
Weave weave in they hair, weed in they purse, still Crunk
She got gel and
Weave, gel and weave
She got gel and weave, gel and weave
She got gel and weave, gel and weave
Wit a big round ass, I'm yo man to be

[Verse 3]
When you get her on the drank she gon get a lil frisky
Legs stayin open, no rubber, kinda risky
Got a bad body make it move like a gypsy
Cornbread fed at the club very tipsy
Only dealt wit those that be in the hood slangin
Lounge at Matt's car wash shit is where they hangin
System up loud in the car keep it wang'n
Amateur night, shake em up do they thang and
Lookin real hard she'll know that I want it
Got me on hard so I go and get upon it
Hey baby gal, all that, can you lone it
Weave and them contacts, man I'ma bone it
Say it's all good she about to kick her man out
Left her wit a wood and she gon blow the brains out
All in her bed so I had to yank my thang out
Pullin on her fro, wasn't hair and it came out
