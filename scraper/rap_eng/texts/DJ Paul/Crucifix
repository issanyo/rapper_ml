[Hook]
Inside, inside, inside, inside that funk, can hypnotize, hypnotize
I'm scared, a nigga dead, I'm scared
A nigga dead, a nigga dead
It's in my fuckin' head

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Late nights I cruise in my Chevrolet
Scopin' out the houses where those stay
Who don't pay the fizz-ines to Triple 6
Twice and never make a house call bitch
Murder is all on my mind, so I grab my plastic nine
I'm forced to only go (low) where my soul sent me
Some shit now look deep into my eyes
And plus the Devil's in me
Don't try to offense the
Six to the third power see
Don't cross that set bitch I'll stang you once
In front of these machine... guns, we point... don't run
It's kinda hard to duck, when I start to buck, buck
I bet you won't get buck, you fuck ass niggas
I catch you slippin', I gets to clippin'
And then we push back my fuckin' trigga
Happy and figga what nigga I've come to destroy you
Your old DJ and fool I enjoyed you
But now it's time to cut the shit
You been tricked, now witness...
Witness my crucifix

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Koopsta Knicca]
Crucifix spread with bloody red all on my pillow
Fool moved by my window so I call my nigga Scarecrow
Chrome he got the nine inside thy thand
Cause me can't go man
I constantly fight these devils though inside it seems he's winnin'
No witness in the dark
I start to rip some hearts up in them parts
Where's your God, where's your God, oh where's your fuckin' God?
Soon or later playa days'll come with many greater
Robbers, killers, cocaine dealers, the realest
Enormous haters
I'm wagin', awaitin' them demons in the fuckin' basement
Leavin' niggas shakin when they face the face of Satan
Ten safens in thy casket mend the soul and then I grasp it
That's all they got too far and then
The hurt deepens and crackens
Me, Juicy and Paul mane
Was rollin' in the fuckin lone
Headed to a muthafuckin ritual
Where I never tell nobody but somebody wouldn't know
Ya sold ya soul what's the cost
You hoes was scared bitch
Robbin' these bitches and make me some riches
Invite 'em to my crucifix

[Hook x3]
