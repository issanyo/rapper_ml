Fuck all them hoes who wanna talk that shit

To all you dirty hoes I'm sayin' fuck you

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Fuck all them hoes who wanna talk that shit
Sorry motherfuckers, stupid bitches y'all can suck my dick
Who gives a fuck about yo car or yo pay check
Cause if I catch you slippin', bitch, I'mma take it
Stalkin' out the streets like I'm in a fuckin' daze
Thinkin' how in the hell am I gonna get paid
As the world goes round another nigga's goin' down
So I mix the Aliz√© with the E&J and Crown
Never ever in my life have I crossed a true friend
Never ever blamed a nigga on how he made his ends
See a nigga that's weak, don't put him under estimation
That sick bullshit will have ya under investigation
Real niggas don't play and betray, they be secret
If you call yourself a killa then go ahead and be it
If you black and you down hold yo nuts and stick together
Cause I never knew a nigga who said he's gonna live forever

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
I don't give a fuck about a fat bitch that wanna talk trash
Listen to the clip, my .380 capper in ya ass
The hoe got makers (...) dissed her on my tape
Fat hoe talkin' shit; with a broom you get raped
Till yo own roadies left ya and came to our clique
Because my clique, it's really too motherfuckin' thick
Change ya panties hoe, I hang with niggas with triggers
Oh my god I got the family scared to go in the backyard
It's some niggas in my motherfuckin' town (?)
Gonna get beatdown
Or get a motherfuckin' round of the Tec-9 clown
I'm tired of groupie hoes payin' on my phone
Or sayin' hoe shit about a nigga (?)
These hoes can't fuck with the Backyard
Because the Backyard too motherfuckin' hard on they ass
And don't be barrin' a hoe that act like a bitch
I just say fuck all them hoes that talk that shit
