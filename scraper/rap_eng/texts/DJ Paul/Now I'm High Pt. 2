[Hook: Gangsta Blac]
Triple Six, Triple Six

Triple Six, smoked out

Now I'm high, now I'm high
Now I'm high, really high

[Verse 1: Koopsta Knicca]
Hoe why these bitches quick to jump to get they motherfuckin' head bump
I popped my trunk and then I blast them trizzicks with my pump
Here because of the shit that a nigga had committin'
When I hit 'em from the night before
Cause then I sworn I had to take them bustas to the morgue
So sweat is low I have to go out like Charles Manson
The Koopsta committin' evil shit with the mind of satan
A motherfuckin' hard lead, nervous in the head
And yeah it's gonna be another nigga dead
Twistin' on my dreads while I'm loadin' up my milli rounds
So we can gonna spray and buck these busta bitches down
Oh cause I'm really, really tired of hearin' babbage shit
So let me hit them tricks and label this the crucifix
The Koopsta's from the Ville, where the Devil Shyt for real
My type of killa leave you burnin' in the cornfield
Because yo god got you niggas think you damn hard
I break ya apart and have a ritual in the fucking park

[Hook: Gangsta Blac]

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
Mask to my fuckin' face, I'm fiendin to increase my high
Eyeballs is like red as hell, you bitches better recognize
Gangsta Boo the scandalous that bitch that call me so so thick
Smoked out, loced out, playas all around but known as Triple Six
Million blunts up in my mind, yeah my nig it's campaign time
Smoked up all the blunts and now I'm high, I'm on cloud nine
Jump trick up and fool I click, yo get yo fuckin' body bust
Bitches bodies chopped in bits and guts and shit off in my trunk
Str-izz-apped all the time because some evil shit goes through my head
Bullets to your temple got you bitches dead up in the med
Bloody Glock is cocked and ready pop up on another hoe
Hollow points will have yo bitch-ass knockin' on the devils door
Bitches, bitches who's back this, niggas, nigga blast me bitch
Pimpin' ... this shit because yeah bitch you know it's thick
On yo motherfuckin' ass, claim yourself a lazy bee
Doggin' all you phonky hoes, nigga you can't fuck with me

[Verse 3: Playa Fly]
From the darkness of da kut; Lil Fly is on the fuckin' scene
Chicken Wing he got that blink, sn-izz-ow got me lookin' mean
Paul just scooped a nigga up, now we bumpin' part two
Now I'm high, really high, what the fuck you gonna do?
Hollow P is in this hoe, bitch you know we on that blow
Chillin' on the wall of fame and yo you know we tangin' hoe
First I chief the bl-izz-unt then I hit that motherfucking tang
Gangsta V, Fly with plenty blunts in that Ponti thang
Ridin' in the Ponti mane, blowin' blunts of pimpin' stangs
See a (?) of bitches now it's time for Fly to speak some game
Now I'm vampin' from these hoes, Indo smoke up in my nose
Bitch Fly smoke them blunts and fuck them junts

Tanqueray, Grand Marnier, watch me roll a blunt of hay
Dip it in Courvoisier and chief it in you bustas face
Now I'm high, really high, till I reach the fucking top
Party till I drop around the clock, this shit don't never stop

Yeah Lil Fly up in this motherfucker once again hoe
Shouts out to all my niggas in the SPV, my nigga ...
