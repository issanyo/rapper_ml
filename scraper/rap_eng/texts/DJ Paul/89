[Verse 1-AD]
Really don't know what I had to do to get here
Devil was pulling me I was tryna steer my shit clear
Niggas was hatin' bitches was plottin' how to fit here
Man I swear to god I been through it all fuckin' this year
Granny got cancer again, my brother facing 10
Alonzo got killed, I'll never see his face again
And Trinny still Loccin' but he ain't eatin' in the pen
My little girl was gettin' older man its time to fuckin' win
Got twitter verified but fuck a blue check
And my checking ain't lookin' like its supposed to
I'm tired of talkin' about this blue rag
Niggas turned up when I'm crippin' on the Pro Tools
Like I ain't gotta tell it
My other shit ain't valid
All up in the gym got me eating only salads
Cause image is everything in this industry, thats what they tell me
What happened to being real? Rest in peace to Mackaveli, damn...
Where-Where is the love
Some niggas considered brothers, man they went and turned their back on me
When I see um, I don't, know how to act homie
Fake friends from the past got a track for me
First, now man I got attacks on me
I say I'm Hollywood cause I only pick the phone up for one reason
Only hit a nigga up to get in Hollywood clubs
Man fuck all of y'all, fuck all of y'all
Got a problem with authority so fuck all the law
No trustin' a bitch, so its fuck all ya broads
No negative niggas, I cut all of y'all
Ridin' through the city, feelin' hoodie, hope you [?] for them haters
Put it all on the line for the grind, minus the paper

[Verse 2-DJ Paul]
Y'all really don't know all the shit that we went through to create the Three 6
A nigga had to hustle hard, be hard from the start, steal and rob, flip cars, flip coke bricks
I wasn't born rich, I was born sick and to the [?] my high school was like academy for hood wars
Over 30 million sold
Grindin' out of control
Still it took us 16 years to get Academy Award
Y'all niggas don't wanna pull swords
Go to war with us, shit you can't afford
You want the check but your shit was void
I'm the nigga that you need to try to avoid
I don't trust you fakers while you all in my face talkin' bout lets get paper
What you bringin' to the table cause I know you ain't able
In your hood you wear "I'm a snitch" label nigga
Y'all really don't know
Better ask about me, better ask them nigga rappin' bout me
Been a [?] for a reason, these [?] walkin' out the 4 Seasons, bitch braggin' bout me
Everyday its check season
Everyday I give a nigga reason to hate me, I gotta win
Still swim in my old money, make some new money, spend it with my old homies, fuck new friends, nigga
