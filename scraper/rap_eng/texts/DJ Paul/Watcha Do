[Intro: DJ Paul]
Ah yeah, these hoes always talkin' bout' all the shit they got fitting tha' DKNY. They don't tell you what they did to get it!

[Chorus: Lord Infamous]
Watcha do, watcha do (watcha do)
Watcha do, watcha do
Watcha do, watcha do
Watcha do, watcha do
Watcha do, watcha do
Watcha do, watcha do (what it is)
Watcha do, watcha do
Watcha do, watcha do (what it is)

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Bitch don't play dumb
Stick out your tongue
And let me take a plunge
For plenty you don't have to suck your thumb
I got yum-yum
At night you have nice dreams
Bout' spices and ice cream
You look kind of feisty
Your lips they entice me
Don't fight it, don't try to front like you don't like it
I can tell you get excited
I'm gon' spank it
Put your head up under the blanket
It's the tightest
A Mafia, so play it to the Triple 6 to the tre'
Until tonight Lord Infamous is on the entree

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
You niggas be killin' me
Say you'll never do me
But still you do it
Every time I turn around
You punk is in the booty
Is it hard to pick em' out
Hell na'
I'm on the top of that
All real hoes know a nigga that lick on the cat
That's a fact
Niggas be one of the main ones doin' it
Come and eat a little punk ass nigga
Fuck screwin' it
Little Peter Piper
These playas for the pussy eaters
Got you rock hard
After my nut, you's a dick beater

[Chorus: Lord Infamous]
Watcha do, watcha do (watcha do)
Watcha do, watcha do
Watcha do, watcha do
Watcha do, watcha do
Watcha do, watcha do
Watcha do, watcha do (what it is)
Watcha do, watcha do
Watcha do, watcha do (what it is)

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Slob on my knob
Like corn on the cob
Check in with me
And do your job
Lay on the bed
And give me head
Don't have to ask
Don't have to beg
Juicy is my name
Sex is my game
Let's call the boys
Let's run a train
First Find a mate
Second find a place
Third find a bag
To hide the ho face

[Verse 4: DJ Paul]
It's bout' 2-0-9
I'm ridin' Viper tryin' to find somethin' freaky
Cause I think it's about that time
Me and my dogs
Done snort two 'balls
Now I need a big mout'
For a dick and two balls
It's Paul
Askin' with ya
Take face Willy
165 pound, skinny nigga, beer belly
I'm bout' to take her to get it tight
From all of y'all
No paper chasin' I'm in the ocean tryin' to catch some jaws

[Verse 5: Crunchy Black]
These bitches got me goin'
The feelin' of a warm mouth
Man I tell you bout' these hoes chewin' in the South
It's on
Once I get it alone I bone
A whole deep along but that's another song
We on the subject of these hoes, and they suckin' dick
Don't frown hoes
You the main ones don' it
Crunchy Black up in the bitch
I tell the truth dog
All these hoes goin'
Don't let em' fool y'all

[Interlude: DJ Spanish Fly]
Yo, this is DJ Spanish Fly
Live at the shake joint
And they shake the tooshie, watcha do
Three 6 Mafia a wor-rr

[Verse 6: Koopsta Knicca]
See I be swingin' at a bitch like a nigga tryin' to hit a pinata
Ten niggas dick up in your motherfuckin' stomach
Came across a dick
They got you grippin' up on your head
Buckin' on south spreadin' pussy
Fool it farted
Men, plaster fallin' up off the walls
While I'm fuckin' her like a dog
She constantly lickin' on my balls
All up on my dick
And on my nuts
It's just the best I be
Rat tat tat tat tat had to watch how quickly that bitch react
(Bitch react, bitch react)
