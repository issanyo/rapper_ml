[Intro]
I can't play no more, I can't play no more
I can't, I can't play no more
I can't play no more, I can't play no more
I can't, I can't play no more

[Hook: D.J. Paul]
I can't play no more, dats it for your ass, for your ass
You gotta go to go lil ho, dats it for your ass, for your ass
You done took it there, dats it for your ass, for your ass
So I'ma take it there, dats it for your ass, for your ass
I can't play no more, dats it for your ass, for your ass
You gotta go lil ho, dats it for your ass, for your ass
You done took it there, dats it for your ass, for your ass
So I'ma take it there, dats it for your ass, for your ass

[Verse 1: D.J. Paul]
The game is over, let the pain begin
These niggas acting lame again
[?]
Got a dick in another white mouth again
I'ma always win, you can bet on that
Fuck with me and I'mma let off that
The sound of my voice get pussies wet
The sound of my chopper getting pussy niggas wet
I'm a motherfucking threat, better know that
Guns flash quicker than the kodak
We whip a nigga wig like Kojak
He hidin' from the hater like Lojack
Swing on a nigga he gone miss rap
Bitch nigga, I ain't breakin' fist for that
Hit him with a bottle with a fifth of that
Break the whole bottle, not a fifth of that
I'm done with these fuck boys
Act dumb on these fuck boys
Set alarms off on these fuckboys
Put guns off on these fuck boys
I've been holding my goons back for a long time
Now I'mma let them eat these niggas alive like a buffet line

[Hook: D.J. Paul]
I can't play no more, dats it for your ass, for your ass
You gotta go to go lil ho, dats it for your ass, for your ass
You done took it there, dats it for your ass, for your ass
So I'ma take it there, dats it for your ass, for your ass
I can't play no more, dats it for your ass, for your ass
You gotta go lil ho, dats it for your ass, for your ass
You done took it there, dats it for your ass, for your ass
So I'ma take it there, dats it for your ass, for your ass

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
On that presidential skunk, that's that Donald Trump
Real OG, my pockets on Professor Clump
Yellow diamonds in that bitch look like Captain Crunch
Money hungry, 100 milli, what I have for lunch
Trippy nigga, I just filled a garbage bag with weed
It look like I rob jack for his bag of P's
Loudest nigga in the club quick to call the cops
These young niggas ain't tryna box, better bring yo Glock
Turn that nigga song, all you hear is street talk
Catch him outside the studio, all you hear is bitch talk
Payin' for protection the only way you get passed
You don't pay them killers when you hit the city? That's your ass

[Hook: D.J. Paul]
I can't play no more, dats it for your ass, for your ass
You gotta go to go lil ho, dats it for your ass, for your ass
You done took it there, dats it for your ass, for your ass
So I'ma take it there, dats it for your ass, for your ass
I can't play no more, dats it for your ass, for your ass
You gotta go lil ho, dats it for your ass, for your ass
You done took it there, dats it for your ass, for your ass
So I'ma take it there, dats it for your ass, for your ass
