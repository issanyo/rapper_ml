I'm trying to get me a couple millions
Or a billion
Stunting on you haters with my gold face grilling

In your neighbourhood, with a fine ass brazilian
Got the drug money mane, so I gotta spend it
Fli-Flip that, get it back, I'm open for your business
Drumma Boy, Memphis Tenn, yeah we in the building
Trying to stack this cheese real high to the ceiling

[Hook x2: Gucci Mane]

I woke up balling, I went to sleep stunting
Never too much, never too much money

15 pounds of Cali Purp, can you flip that?
Yeah her booty real fat, nigga wanna stick that
25 stacks, make it rain, can you tip that?
Loui's on my face, and a pair on my feet-on
Wolf dogs on the streets, lambs that get eat on
Don't pay your bills, and you end up in the street man
Dumb niggas don't care, living for the week'ond
Green candy, chrome rims, hoes started speak-on
Big booty mix brah, brains like a [?]
Benjam'ans in rubber bands what I'm seek-on
Rolls and Ros√©, watch her coochie get to leak-on

[Verse 4: Yung Joc]

Hundred racks around the corner, gotta go and pick them up
Duffel bag, duffel bag, I can't get enough of that
Maserati look like [?], tryna fuck with that
I gotta have it, I'm a stone cool addict
For mathematics I take the money, flip it then i stack it
Split the swisher then pack it, Gucci say he gonna match it
Got a Brightling on the wrist, so I bought a Bently to match it

[Hook x2: Gucci Mane]
I can't stop, I won't stop

Rain so much she had to get an umbrella
Need a Beyonce to drank what I drank
If you freaky like Lil Kim, then you think like I think, haaah!

Tell BET Rocsi need to get mean
Swagger through the club, looking just like money
My little boy one, but his shoes $400, Gucci!

Gucci all red, so he's shitting on the infants
He shitting on the infants, Gucci all red, man these shoes $450
