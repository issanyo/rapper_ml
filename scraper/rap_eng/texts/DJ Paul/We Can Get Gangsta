I gotta call from my dawg, Gangsta Fred jus da other day
Met some nigga from da other way, wanna purchase yay
Said dey wanna get good shit for da low-low
Fred grew-up wit dis nigga by da bayou
Could be da po-po, that's the way my mind think
Thought about the shit for a
Minute, then I took a drank
Thinkin of a coma, knowin I ain't gonna fall
Call up my cousin, Poncho, let em rob, assault
Den he ball off, wit da goods to a rendez-vous, spot
Handed Fred back his dope, den we split da loot
Rudy-Poo's, always gettin, got, sumthin serious
Infactuated wit da game, very curious
Dat'll kill da cat, cause da game ain't to be told
Quit smokin crack, my nigg-a, it's to be sold
Gettin old, never worries me, I don't give a fuck
Let dem po's stay on my mind, call dat nigga up

If you hoes wanna go dere
We can get gangsta, we can get gangsta, we can get gangsta
(Boom, boom, boom wit da trigga, I can...)
In da streets, we don't play fair
We can get gangsta, we can get gangsta, we can get gangsta
(Boom, boom, boom wit da trigga, I can...)

We can set dis shit up, for a, secluded area
Tell em bring himself, and da duffle-bag carrier
Met him 4am, hit Creek Hill, at a Exxon
In a hot car, tech-9 and a rouger gun
Another nigga came, wit da nigga, dey got out of 'Lac
Fred slammed da door, crossed da trunk, "Where da cheese at?"
Nigga took a sniff, and he seen dat da shit was straight
Said dat da loot was in his trunk, now I'm thinkin, "Wait."
"What's goin on?", partner took da dope off da trunk
Raisin up my tech, nigga in da trunk, raised da pump
Bullets popped off, Fred caught one, in da chest
Lucky for my nigg', he was wearin bullet proof vest
Shootin tech, but I coulda died, cause it jammed up
Pump at my dome, dat's when Poncho feet had slammed up
Shot da .45, blowin both niggas azz off
Think we got em down, wit da cheese and da sawed-off

If you hoes wanna go dere
We can get gangsta, we can get gangsta, we can get gangsta

Two weeks later, still knowin bout da fuckery
Move dat a nigga pulled, spot a police watchin me
Watchin me, cause I fit description of a suspect
Pullin me, over, now he askin where my license at
"Officer, I done left my wallet at da house, sir."
Still took me Down-town, cause da police don't care
Down in lower-level, man a simple situation
Turned into, a 72-hour investigation
Ima ex-con, so I don't need a walk through
To dis jail shit, wonderin, "Who did dey talk to?"
Could've been my dawg, not my nigg', dat's a hell naw
Dey done found my tech, but I ain't got shit to tell ya'll
Feelin kinda sick, cause dey finna send me up da river
Couldn't be a snitch, cause I can't tell on my nigga
Tech, didn't match da gun, Woons(police) bout to let me go
Stuck wit da gun
Charge, violated my parole
