[Hook]
Blunt to my lips, gun on my hip
Rocks in my sock, pocket full of chips
Watchin' for the pigs, splittin' hater's wigs
Stackin' me some grip, player can you dig?

Blunt to my lips, gun on my hip
Rocks in my sock, pocket full of chips
Watchin' for the pigs, splittin' hater's wigs
Stackin' me some grip, player can you dig?

[Verse 1]
Project Pat, a nigga that's down for his crown mane
If yo' ass step, I'mma be down town mane
Fourth floor bound mane, that's if I get caught mane
Pushed me to the edge, so it really ain't my fault mane
See I gotta die mane, don't you even try mane
Enemies gonna bleed once I let these bullets fly mane
Momma gonna cry mane, I like to get high mane
Niggas passin' plates, snorting line after line mane
I got's to get mine mane, robbin' was the crime mane
That a nigga did, but I done served my time mane
Put that all behind mane, get out on the grind mane
Slang some of this dope, in the street or my ride mane
See I ain't a fool mane, fuck listenin' to you mane
Why you in my grill, and you knowin' we ain't cool mane
Project ain't a duck mane, see I know what's up mane
Get up off my dick, like a motherfuckin' slut mane

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Where I'm from mane, ain't no sunshine gonna shine
On a dog's ass if his ass don't get on a grind
Doing time helped a nigga out, to clear up my head
Used to have a shank in the light, that was by my bed
It was said, I would end up dead, working in the street
But the street is the only thing I see paying me
Quarter-ki, fuck servin' deals, rockin' to the shake
Slanging guns, slanging T.V.'s mane I'm tryna' make
All I can my nigga, French ho Poncho at a ho's house
Get her drunk, take her to the back, put dick in her mouth
Leave the front door unlocked, my nig turn the radio
Pulled the car up into the yard, cleaning out the ho
You should know that a burglary, really ain't for me
I just got out the 'tentiary, tryna' get on my feet
Get the cheese, off the merchandise, went and bought a deal
Nigga please, you say you don't steal, I'mma keep it real

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Haters like to get a playa twisted in that bullshitta
A game-spitter, I'm also a wig-splitter
Yo' ass getta, shot up by the nine milla
Your cap I drilla, when fuckin' with a real nigga
The chrome trigga' should regulate a punk quicker
The bullet hit ya', I'm zoned off that brown liquor
You need to get ya' nose out a nigga's biz
Quit spreading rumors like a motherfuckin' punk bitch
My trunk is the bed for a kidnap victim
Hollowpoint hit him, pull out my gun your hands you get them
Up in the airra because you came to me in error
Don't want to scare ya', say you a man then face the terror
I know these bullets will pop ya' shit off like a melon
Let's bust it up, bad as fuck, man who you tellin'
It's armageddon, in North Memphis crack we sellin'
You pass me that purple weed, is what they yellin'

[Hook]
