[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
The Indo's creating illusions
The substance infesting my brain cell is causing confusion
I picture Teflon in slow motion
It's piercing through flesh and continues to cruising
Wait think straight, don't haste paste penetrate
Face ace sake place base, damn I think I'm crazed
Terrors the error no errors within my terror
Are you scared of 6-double-6, demonically elegant elements
A manic-depressive aggressiveness, stress me bitch
And you will feel the strength of my weapons kit
Tric-kory, hic-kory, dickory dock, I smoke top notch bud crop, drop
The D, the O, the P, the E, I need the B, the L, the U-N-T
Because that green power flower got much love
I tell you don't fuck with the Triple 6 mane
Cause you know that we on them drugs
Damn I'm going off with this blunt outer space rock
Lord Infamous, I keep clouds of smoke flyin out my mouth

[Verse 2: Koopsta Knicca]
Who's that busting up in my door
Was way too slow, I hit the floor
They shot up all my niggas in the kitchen flipping dominos
Blood all on my leg, I wiped this shit up to my fucking head
Caught them trizzicks slipping, buck them busta bitches dead
Peace out to my niggas Tim and Killa, they're my broadies
My momma said there be day like this
But my daddy never told me
And that's why I'm a hard lead twisting on my dreads
I'm scared, a nigga dead, it's in my fuckin' head
Thinking I would hesitate and wait to buck your bitches down
Read up on my tis nigga cause I ain't no damn hologram
But I'm clicking whit that quickness
Like a sickness from that Triple 6
Drop you winning a splander
Cut you up like Jeffrey Dahmer bitch
Really I could care less 'bout a nigga tryin' to flex against
The mothafuckin' Tech, you get some *shots* up in your neck
And when see you the Koopsta Knicca it's a fuckin' redruM
Run, run, run 'fore I leave ya damn body numb
