[Bigga Rankin]
You see, one thing about me: I ain't never been 2nd at anything
I ain't never been no follower
All my life I been at the front of the motherfucking pack
Setting trends, making a way for young niggas to get money
So when you young niggas look at me, I'm who you motherfucking wanna be
I stay bossed up, keep a bad bitch and run this psyche up on the regular
DJ Paul! Let's get this shit

Real nigga, real nigga, real nigga radio!
