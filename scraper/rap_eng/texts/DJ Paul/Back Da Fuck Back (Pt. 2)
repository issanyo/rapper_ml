[Intro]
Uh huh, uh huh
Yuh! Motherfuckers! The originator of everything going on in rap right now
Yours truly

[Verse]
I'm the realest to ever do it
I'm the realest that ever done it
DJ Paul KOM, I'm the reason why they runnin'
Crying to their mommy [?]
Noo, their heads I'mma blow off
Call my hitters, fuck the cost
Haters know that I'm the boss
[?] if you lose
And I don't need no features from you ignorant ass creatures
Trigger [?]
I was born the motherfucking king
What the fuck you mean trick?
I was runnin' the scene when you was having wet dreams
Back in the day they wasn't with it, they was lauging at my ass
Now a nigga got the bag and the bank

[Hook]
Back the fuck back, nigga back the fuck back
Back the fuck back, nigga back the fuck back
Back the fuck back, nigga back the fuck back
Back the fuck back, nigga back the fuck back
