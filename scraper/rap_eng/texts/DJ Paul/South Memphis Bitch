South Memphis bitch
(32x)

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous/Scarecrow]
Now it is time to get rough wid the drama
Bit-ches you can not escape from the hun-ter
Evil, Scarecrow, devils spells go
Deep in my soul, blood on my clothes
Crim-inal hands and I must squeeze a weapon
Listen to sounds of the lead when we step-pin'
Infamous comes from the south territory
Listen to some of my deep money poetry
Circles of Triple 6 men smokin' ganja
Ri-tuals wid dead bodies on the furniture
So many soldiers are comin' to destroy ya
Six million sinister, satanic warriors
Is ill, will drill, will kill nina milli
Flame afilli I will fill thee enemy
Wid the five twenty slugs to the mug
One mo' trick in the mud
Quick, I want all my niggas in the south to say this shit

South Memphis Bitch
(24x)

Verse 2: Lord Infamous/Scarecrow

The loud thump, of the pump
Knock our chunks in the fuckin' punks
South Parkway in this bitch, letâ€™s all smoke a thousand blunts
My niggas over in Havana Hill, packin' plenty steel
All my niggas over in Claybert Homes, gangstas on the real
The Gardens, Herden Parkway, yeh and Fowler Homes
Texas Court, Gs cause in Mclemore they crackin' domes
Foote Homes, Lemont terrorist, in Riverside
South Memphis niggas ready for a fuckin' homicide
The Southgate, BellSouth Sea, Trick and Lauderdale
Snatchin' off the side of niggas heads wid the shotgun shells
Low View Heights, Kansas, Wellington, Cambridge
Tryna cross South Memphis man I swear you wish you never did
South Memphis motherfuckin' South, yeh that's what I said
The place where plenty playas, plenty murderers will bone that brig
When the smoke clears from the fire you will witness
All my niggas gettin' wild straight from fuckin'

South Memphis bitch
