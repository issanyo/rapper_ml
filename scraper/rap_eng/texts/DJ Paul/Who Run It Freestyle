[V.I]
Time to infiltrate the squad
Need me blue hunnit large
Keeping hoes on they job
Butterfly call her face lift
Get your face twist
Roll up go to mars
Push button start spaceship
Holy smokes hear the words
Now bow your head
And say grace bitch amen
Bloody hands couple Xans
Dammit for the Benz
Manson Martin Teflon armor
Dirty jeans hold 20 twins
Beg your pardon mama comma
Hold up I'ma fuck you where?
Steady cat walking in Ksubi
Bitch when see me say amen
Leak you now you to can drip
Who the man walking talking casket damn
Hear the flow re-wrote with writ
I'm still gliding on they kryptonite
And since I've been spilling juice to sip
Hearing rumors probably true
That I'ma papa to some kids
Swear they been gankin and faking
And perpetrating language for years
And it's all off of drip swear to the Memph triple 6
Lil Corb, Lil Jule, word to Pimp, Soulja Slim
Cause I'm often caution sparking moshing
Flossing gorgeous bossing shit you talking
Got me nauseous this gon put 'em back in coffin
Taking styles so took it back
Tommy briefs to hold my sack
Cock black her Benz on blaatt
Fuck her til she asthma-tack
I'ma eat it I'ma beat it then M-skeet it with no beam huh
That ded boy a hot boy 500 Degreez huh

[Hook]2x
Who run it? you run it ?
Who want it? mu'fucker you want it?
Ded fuckers blue hunnits
Money talks no discussion
She gon fuck out in public
Whoadie I'm next in running
