[Intro: Juicy J & Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Smoked out, loced out riding with the pistol grip
I don't love hoes mane, I'm aiming at your skull
Smoked out, loced out riding with the pistol grip
I don't love hoes mane, I'm aiming at your skull
Smoked out, loced out riding with the pistol grip
I don't love hoes mane, I'm aiming at your skull

[Hook: Project Pat]
Walk up to your house, knock on your door
And blow your ass off
(Drop it off, drop it off) bitch I got a sawed off
Walk up to your house, knock on your door
And blow your ass off
(Drop it off, drop it off) bitch I got a sawed off

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Late last night lying in the bed eyes red
Thinking should I get these hoes
Thinking should I cut their heads
Should a nigga plan a hit or grab my pistol grip
And take care my business cause they don't who they're fucking with
Call my nigga Project Pat cause I know he got my back
Fuck writing rhymes, this is real shit, not a track
Camouflage in the dark for them boys who act hard
The devil on my left side, the other side I'm seeing god
Why do niggas talk shit?
Niggas can't stick together
Seeing a nigga get killed will make a nigga feel better
So I just walk in a pace thinking of the case of motherfuckers
Who trait pistol to your fucking face
This ain't no game nigga, my finger's on the trigger
The time is running out, my conscience says I gotta get him
Is there a way that a nigga can escape from hell
I fuck him up with the Mossberg buck shells bitch

[Hook: Project Pat]
Walk up to your house, knock on your door
And blow your ass off
(Drop it off, drop it off) bitch I got a sawed off
Walk up to your house, knock on your door
And blow your ass off
(Drop it off, drop it off) bitch I got a sawed off
Walk up to your house, knock on your door
And blow your ass off
(Drop it off, drop it off) bitch I got a sawed off
Walk up to your house, knock on your door
And blow your ass off
(Drop it off, drop it off) bitch I got a sawed off

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Mossberg is all he heard after the doorbell rang
Buckshots to the brain, Triple 6 style mane
This antibiotic’s for any nigga sick about my six double-six
An automatic wizzig splizzit
We motherfucking deep, my niggas in Fowler Homes down
S.P.V., Cleaborn Homes, Watkins & Brown, Queensmound
Trigg & Lauderdale, Lakeview G’s, and them Texas Court G’s
The riverside G.A.N.G.S.T.A
Niggas down with the Triple Six Mafia
Let's ride, smoked out, loced out with a fat .45 on the seat
About to make a sucka nigga eat the barrel when I stick it in his mouth
Give me cheese, say your ABC's
Kind of hard to do when my pistol's in your grill
Mouth full of gold teeth, smile for the kill
I'm telling you sucka ass niggas for the last time
Don't run your mouth
The Triple Six Mafia niggas will blow your ass off

[Hook: Project Pat]
Walk up to your house, knock on your door
And blow your ass off
(Drop it off, drop it off) bitch I got a sawed off
Walk up to your house, knock on your door
And blow your ass off
(Drop it off, drop it off) bitch I got a sawed off
Walk up to your house, knock on your door
And blow your ass off
(Drop it off, drop it off) bitch I got a sawed off
Walk up to your house, knock on your door
And blow your ass off
(Drop it off, drop it off) bitch I got a sawed off
Walk up to your house, knock on your door
And blow your ass off
(Drop it off, drop it off) bitch I got a sawed off
Walk up to your house, knock on your door
And blow your ass off
(Drop it off, drop it off) bitch I got a sawed off
