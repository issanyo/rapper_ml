[Intro: DJ Paul]

You know we got to do one for all these niggas
Out here sideline hating, you know what I'm saying?
Don't get mad cause a nigga straight up
Out the paint shop or the car lot or what not
Feeling mean on the scene with a pocket full of green
You know what I'm saying? And any one of y'all hoes think
A nigga gonna give them something, I can't give you shit
But this dick in your motherfucking mouth and in your motherfucking hole
And you got to reach me something for that, ho'
Cause I ain't for free, bitch
Pay what you motherfucking weigh

[Verse 1: Crunchy Black]
I pull up clean in my black fucking truck
My rims still spinning so you know I'm cutting up
I'm riding down the street, bumping nothing but us
I spotted me a freak, she was about to catch a buzz
I asked her what's her name, baby, it could be love
But you know you boy don't fuck with nothing but sluts
The ones that make money and stack them bucks
A bank for that cap and a bank for that butt

[Verse 1 Continued: Juicy J]

Nigga, I'll tell your girl she can suck on this big ol' dick
And won't be fucked up 'bout it if she pay her rent to a pimp
And in the public's eyes she can be legit, be my bitch
Cause at the shake junt she got to work a trick, get the grip
And never no back talking cause I call her jack, backhand slap
She come up short with money, baby, then I snap with a strap
She gotta let these hoes know who the shit running this
And you just might have to throw some blows
Take a hit wit the fist

[Hook: Mr. Bigg and DJ Paul]x2
Don't you, don't you get mad when I swerve and I twist
Riding, riding down your block, I got my charm out the window
Don't you get mad when I swerve and I twist
I ain't bragging on myself but I deserve this, miss

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
I'm swerving, I'm twisting from side to side
I got that iron right on my side
Them 20 inch vogues with the yellow stripes
A 'rillo rolled up with some of that light
The 360 turn on the fold down screens
Turn it all the way around and watch it from the front seat
The knock in the back, get the trunk on rattle
Them hoes flocking to my whip thick like cattle

[Verse 2 Continued: Lil Flip]
Hey, you better put that money in my hand
I was born to be a mack, not your motherfucking man
You mad cause I hit your ho, me and her split your dough
Why you acting surprised, I know you heard this shit before?
Me and Quint, pushing 'Vettes, smoking 'dro, no stress
One tech, two Glocks, infra red, no vests
I clock dollars and pop collars for a living
I'm at Pressure World every time I hit Memphis

[Hook: Mr. Bigg and DJ Paul]x2
Don't you, don't you get mad when I swerve and I twist
Riding, riding down your block, I got my charm out the window
Don't you get mad when I swerve and I twist
I ain't bragging on myself but I deserve this, miss
