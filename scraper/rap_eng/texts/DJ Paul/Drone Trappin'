Trappin' trappin' trappin' trappin'...

[Hook: Locodunit] 2x
Trappin' with the drone, trappin' with the drone
Trappin' with the drone, trappin' with the drone
Trappin' with the drone, trappin' with the drone
Send a pack to yo plug and I'm still at my home

[Verse 1: Locodunit]
I used to sell posted at the Texico
But now I'm flyin' drones over Mexico
Addictives swarmin' over they head
No literally, I'm 'bout to serve some dope over they head
I got (?), montana and a bunch of X too
Drones with the camera and a GPS too
I'm usin' technology to sell narcotic beans
They tell me don't sell drugs but get it like reverse psychology
Pull it in the sky, got the remote control
No more standin' on a corner, that's a fuckin' no no
The plug hit me up, it's a fuckin' GoPro
Send a pound on the drone with the fuckin' GoPro
Higher definition, higher definition
Drugs on the drone, higher definition
I don't need a uber, I don't (?)
I don't need a nigga all up in my business
Drugs in da air, watch it from the kitchen
Sell a nigga dope while I'm washin' dishes
Twelve on the street, twelve wanna get me
Drones in da air, twelve ain't fuckin' with me

[Hook: Locodunit] 2x
Trappin' with the drone, trappin' with the drone
Trappin' with the drone, trappin' with the drone
Trappin' with the drone, trappin' with the drone
Send a pack to yo plug and I'm still at my home

[Verse 2: Lil Infamous]
Flyin' birds down south for the winter
I'm trappin' with the drone, yeah I deliver
Tidy up yo dope sales, got some work on the scale
Then we send it in the air, like FedEx with the mail
(?) niggas (?) straight to yo home
E.T will know the label, watch the no-flying zones
Fed's watchin', they say "Is it a bird? It's a plane?"
(?), caine, X pills, activism, mary jane
I be packin' with the drone, stackin' with the drone
Sendin' dope everywhere, directly traffic with the drone
Hit the plug with the loot and send it back in with the drone
(?) drone watchin', got some payless on my phone
If you wanna ship drop your location
No trace so you can still trap on probation
Pull the app up on the phone, uber, uber, uber
The driver he'll move her, send 'em while they bring it to ya

[Hook: Locodunit] 2x
Trappin' with the drone, trappin' with the drone
Trappin' with the drone, trappin' with the drone
Trappin' with the drone, trappin' with the drone
Send a pack to yo plug and I'm still at my home

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
I used to be posted, Black Haven Zone hoe
Now I send that dope straight from my home hoe
Trappin', trappin', trappin' with that drone yo
I stay snappin', snappin', snappin' with that chrome hoe
Behind a nigga on the block, they don't even know I'm behind they bricks
Behind these bricks and mortars, send these bricks straight up with a bullet, trick
With my bitch in my crib, smoked out, loced out
Stackin' bills, doin' deals, ain't even left my couch
Sendin' off these birds with my robot bird
Mi-middle of the summer, I got (?) birds
Always got packs at 24/7, niggas stay over the 7-11
On my James Bond shit, bitch that's Double 0 Seven

[Hook: Locodunit] 4x
Trappin' with the drone, trappin' with the drone
Trappin' with the drone, trappin' with the drone
Trappin' with the drone, trappin' with the drone
Send a pack to yo plug and I'm still at my home
