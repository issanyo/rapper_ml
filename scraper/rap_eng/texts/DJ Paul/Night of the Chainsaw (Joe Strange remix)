[Violent J]
PCP, meth, mad anti-depression pills
Everything spills into one pot
On top of that I smoke rock
I hear that shit, but I won't stop
Last time on the spot choked a cop
Stopped and had a Faygo soda pop
In the back of my truck, Chuck the chainsaw
Usually chop wood, but that ain't all
It's a bit strange all up in your mid-range
Cut a hole in your head 'till I hit brains
Left a cop in the pile while maybe
It's the night of the chainsaw baby

Cut 'em up Chuck (somebody)
Cut 'em up Chuck (get bloody)
Cut 'em up Chuck (go nutty)
Cut 'em up chuck (go)
Cut 'em up chuck (go)
Cut 'em up

[Juicy J:]
All my niggas got them choppers they can't wait to shoot
Catch you when you check your mail and they let em loose
Niggas always talking shit that they ain't never do
Out here livin lies, must be scared of the truth
Bitch you got me hot, now you a dead man
Pussy nigga acting hard on his webcam
Money on yo head, yeah I'm the bread man
Kill you while you with yo bitch, you dead fam
Stop all the hatin, why you jealous my nigga?
Blow your ass up, the paramedics come and get ya
But they can't help, nigga better believe
Nigga got outta line left him dead on the scene

[Violent J]
Petroleum, inhale it, and take a swig
Heat my brains up, bake my wig
Killing time, with no shirt homie
I love it when the blood squirt on me
Walked up to a house, jabbed the door
And kicked it in, my victim hid
Stuck Chuck in the closet
And I can tell by the deposit, I got my target
French poodle, stomp it limp noodle
Rev Chuck up and stir the strudel
Guts on the lawn, fuck's going on?
Chainsaw Chuck 'till the break of dawn, bitch!

Cut 'em up Chuck (somebody)
Cut 'em up Chuck (get bloody)
Cut 'em up Chuck (go nutty)
Cut 'em up chuck (go)
Cut 'em up chuck (go)
Cut 'em up

[DJ Paul:]
Sitting in my room with my gun cocked and loaded
Put it to my head and I'm bout to explode it
Sniffing up some killa and I'm headed on some crazy shit
Yeah I'm gettin high like ?? and I just hit a crazy bitch
That ain't the case cause we don't sweat the old hoes
Unless she on her knees giving a nigga deep throat
You see I can't cope
With fake niggas, fake bitches, fake playas I cut they fuckin throat
And I'll kill my motherfuckin self
Before I let one of you niggas take the credit for my death
I'll run up in yo pad with a pocket full of bombs
Blow you bums to the motherfuckin slums

[Violent J]
Bloody feet, no shoes, into a party
I wasn't invited, but that bitch ignited
I screamed and laughed, chopping fools in half
I stab and hack, a mad lumberjack
Smell that fuel, hear the machine
Chuck's a demon, I must be dreamin'
Bloody showers, feel the power
We devour you fuckin' cowards
A loony loose, Chuck full of juice
Beggin's no use, I knows no truce
It's yo noose about to see your own produce

Cut 'em up Chuck (somebody)
Cut 'em up Chuck (get bloody)
Cut 'em up Chuck (go nutty)
Cut 'em up chuck (go)
Cut 'em up chuck (go)
Cut 'em up
