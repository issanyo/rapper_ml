[Intro]
Aah Lord Infamous the motherfucking Scarecrow
In the (?) house, ya bitch
And you punk ass motherfuckers finna get beat the fuck down

[Hook/Samples]

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
I got some brass knuckles
For the bitch who try to fuck with me
Got a steel tote for the nigga who try to duck me
Walls stained with brains from the bitch that owe me
Say she got some static, slip and get that tag on the toe, see
I ain't the type of motherfucker that real filled with that anna
I'm the type of motherfucker that fill you full of the ammo
These suckers be claimin' they servin' and sprayin'
Them bitches, I blow out they candle
I handle the shit like that, Scarecrow ain't for no hoe games
For the ones that didn't know: Scarecrow brain's kinda strange
Aim my pistol, strike it dead on the nostril
Bitch don't test the Scarecrow 'cause the Scarecrow kinda hostile
Sock yo ass with a buckshot in yo wind pipe
What the fuck is a fair fight? Scarecrow tryin' to take yo life
Stomp you in yo face till there's no light and no sounds
Look at you now, just another punk beat down

[Hook/Samples]

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
I aimin' for yo face, so that's where the bullets will go
Niggas be talkin' the shit on these tapes but they don't do it in the streets, so
I hang with my rap group named "The Serial Killaz"
And do all of my dirt with the Backyard, my real n-izz-iggas
Cause when somethin' goes down our whole crew gotta clown
Shoot one you gotta shoot 'em all and still you gotta leave town
But see the killas don't play and a Nina (?)
Listen to the words I say: Bring it on, nigga, bring it on
Niggas this way you watch that shit you be talkin' on beat
Put to an end treat
Bring yourself, yo family and yo crew prepared to be
Talkin' on yo tapes, it seem you got some animosity
But you can't test us in the streets, you never say none to me
We thicker than concrete that's why we be runnin' the clown
Different hoods come together that'll beat all of you down
And Backyard niggas love to clown on tricks like you
That's why you get beat down

[Hook/Samples]

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
Cruisin' through the Down Town blocks, Red Bull in my lap
Paul steer and I'm loadin' the gats, I'm ready to spit some fucking cap, now
I heard them bitch ass niggas been talkin' all the shit again
Fuck all them mixtape diss and finna put them bustas to they end
They don't know Scarecrow is on the r-izz-eal
Paul let's hit them faggot motherfuckers up, I'm ready
But stop at the store, let me get some beer and papers
Let's get tore up on this crop before we give these niggas the favor
I passed the brew to the backseat, Napoleon grabs it
Him and Lil Buck in the back, they loadin' automatics
Thinkin' about they summer mix, gettin' pissed off what they said
Damn now I really wanna cut them bitches head
They dead, I see them bitches y'all, yo let's get 'em Paul
Pull down yo mask and make sure you get 'em all
This ain't no bullshit, take you motherfuckers down
Duck yo head, watch yo back, bitch occupy
