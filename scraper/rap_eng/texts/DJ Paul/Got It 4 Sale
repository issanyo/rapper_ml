[Chorus:]
I got it for sale nigga i got it for sale
If you want it come and get it cause i got it for sale. (x4)

[DJ Paul]
They call me the penny pinchin ebenezer
Cause i only make shit that weighs heavy on ya tweeter
Some shit that's gonna blow through ya mutha f**kin speakers
Yall cats it too eager and no i dont believe ya
Yall cats ain't got much but youll get burned
From my hot touch get trapped in the flames
Get slapped in ya face. get out the game
You ain't in the right place. u must be out ya brain

[Chorus]

[Juicy J]
Juicy J. put cats to shame
Three 6 drop beats like acid rain
I told yall before this ain't a damn game
You the weakest link. i be the damn chain
If u a bitch than bitch gimme brains
If you a clean shirt i be the blood stain
When you get hurt i am the pain
That send signals to ya mutha f**kin' brain
I maintain get change spit thangs in wite veins
Ain't a damn thang changed. crystal clear like a picture frame
Me and crunchy black on a damn plane
The architech and president off in the Range

[DJ Paul:]
I be quick to spot you before you get close
Im as good as a biscuit, like breakfast rolls
Stay out my business before i turn critical
Scalp you like an indian ritual
Cause yo my rhymes is too visual
You wanna spit that shit but ya rhymes is too pitiful
You can't get with me. the last samari
That you can't defeat and you wonder why

[Lil Chrome:]
I have no table manners
Hit hard like a mutha f**kin sledge hammer
Got bitches from memphis to alabama
They can't hang with my swag or nuttin
You the ingine that could but im the wood
Shoot first ask questions later
Ill see ya now but won't see ya later
I just gave credit to the grave bruh
I got the dough got the dro
Got the hoes gotta speed up the flow
One mo time. catch scarcrow on the grind
If you ain't bout money dont waste my time
Hypnotize always gon shine
Leave hoes shot from a gun of mine like

[Chorus]
