[Intro]
Let's do this, fuckin' killas
Prophet Posse, Dayton Family
Flint Town, Michigan Style, Memphis
Down South, Gold Teeth
Gold D's, Fuck you hoes
I pimp you bitches like I'm gold
I'm flossin like a bone
I'm shinin' like a motherfuckin diamond
I'm a motherfuckin' playa
I'm a motherfuckin' playa!!!
Finish it nigga
I'm gonna touch your soul
Niggas we be cold
Bank roll, fold, bitches, niggas, hoes
Kick it

[Verse 1: Dayton Family]
Comin from Flint, bitches we big
And plus we 'bout it
Nigga Paul we need that green
Can't live without it
Stop at the store, let's scoop some Moet
And now we rollin
Dollars we foldin' on the strip
Grip is what we holdin'
Makin money, ain't shit funny
About these Memphis streets
Hookers get pimped from their head
To their fuckin' feet
Walk in the Denny's countin' them pennies
You didn't come too soon
Lookin for fuckin' hookers
Suckin' in the bathroom
Step in the alley not no bally
Boy these bitches strife
Better make that money for your pimp
Or he gon' take your life
Third street now choose your feet Motel 61
Lookin for action
So much transaction, better have no gun
Catherine's on a hustle
So why you bitches wishin'
Off from court from Bootleg
And now I'm on a mission
Ghetto ease
He with the Viper rollin 80 G's
Boomin' off keys suck on these
And I'm just smokin' trees
Set me up and get me up
I gotta get ya
Hit ya where we split ya
Makin' sure the story fit ya

[Chorus #1]
Set me up and wet me up
I gotta get ya
Hit ya where we split ya
Makin' sure the story fit ya

[Verse 2: Dayton Family]
Life's a bitch up in the south
Big booty bitches
Got my dick up in their mouth
Pimped her to riches
Where you from?
You make me cum with your pussy lips
Walkin' strips
Shakin' your hips, that's where my money flips
Smakin' bitches
These lazy bitches off that silky powder
Funky bitch
Nigga clean your ass, jump in the shower
Clean my pussy
And make my money fuckin' all these tricks
Suckin' dick
Fillin' in a pickup truck, no time to sit
Get your purse
Nothin' worse than losin' money hoe
You gon' pay me
If you gotta be a hooker with five toes
Sellin draws
Lickin' these balls make me fall in love
Breakin' laws
With pussy walls where you want it touched
Nigga I own it
You the nigga plan to bone it
That Mascarpon√©
If you want it, playa joke up on it
My bitches freaky
I can sneaky bust they head in public
Breakin' off the cane
Fuckin' up they brains
And these bitches love it

[Chorus #2]
My bitches freaky
I can sneaky bust they head in public
Breakin' off the cane
Fuckin' up they brains
And these bitches love it

[Verse: Project Pat, from Killa Klan Kaze]
Now I'mma claim South Side, forever, any day bitch
Mane fuck all this talking, let that AK-40 spray which
Most of y'all like to see some blood spillin' anyway
Bodies fall, niggas dyin' young, all that's everyday
If I slay one of you bustas down it's gon' be a loss
You gon' pay me What you owe and get jacked in that cross
Fire then retire out the game, in and out of jail
Cause I'm bout' this cheese, fuck the fame, you can go to hell
With that shit, got's to get what I can, back on these bricks
Project Pat, suicidal lifestyle, I'm livin' it
Who's to blame when you run yo mouth and you come up dead
Slangin' caine, robbed him for his dope, put some in his head
Fucked that boy off with that sawed off pump
Then I told real McCoy, what you dealin' with, don't get yo wig
Chopped up, Kaze Click we put the fuckin' "d" in dirt
Hooked up with niggas outta Flint and we put in work

[Chorus #3]
Chopped up, Kaze Click we put the fuckin' "d" in dirt
Hooked up with niggas outta Flint and we put in work
