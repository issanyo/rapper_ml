[Intro: Lord Infamous & DJ Paul]
So come and get some 187 invitation
You, you, you just talk a lot of shit but shit don't impress me
So come and get some 187 invitation
You just talk a lot of shit but shit don't impress me
So come and get some 187 invitation
(And, and fuck a nigga who got a goddamn problem with it)
So come and so come and get some 187 invitation
(Slug, slug, slug, slug to the skull and a permanent vacation)
So come and so come and
So come and get some 187 invitation
So come and get some 187 invitation
So come and get some 187 invitation
The, the Triple 6 Mafia got you fools (?)
So come and get some 187 invitation
So come and get some 187 invitation
So come and get some 187 invitation
(Burial, burial, burial, burial, burial insurance
And some hospitalization)

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
I unload the ammo, fire glows
Blood stains on your neck
Pours out your nose
Your life passes right before your eyes
Scarecrows dangerous, you did not realize
You don't know just where you're been taken
All the bones in your body I will break it
I am Lord Infamous, death is my method
Murder murder I just can't help it
Me and my niggas shoot gats
Like we're in a war
Smokin' up some bustaz bitch
That's what we came for
Scarecrow is tellin' you niggas
Who got a damn problem
Yo busta you betta be steppin'
Before I roll up on yo ass
And you feel the full strength
When I'm blastin' my murda weapon
I don't think you wanna fuck with us, playa
I'll shoot yo ass then push you down some stairs
You wanna test the Triple 6 Mafia mane
You best forget it, and fuck a nigga
Who got a goddamn problem with it
Bitch!

[Hook]
So come and get some 187 invitation
So come and get some 187 invitation
So come and get some 187 invitation
Burial insurance and some hospitalization
So come and so come and get some 187 invitation
Burial insurance and some hospitalization
So come and so come and get some 187 invitation
Burial insurance and some hospitalization
So come and so come and get some 187 invitation

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Dead body cremator
Scarecrow I'm burnin' them bodies up in the inferno
Listen to Infamous' lyrical twists as I
Show with the tongue with the turbo
Verbal, mockers abide with a feelin' no
Feelin' these verses the surface
The victim is gettin' real nervous he know that I'm killin'
When gettin' those urges don't be my next target
Niggas are leavin' they blood stains all over the carpet
Butcher bullshit-rappers all in around in the fucked up apartment
Those suckers are starvin'
They go on a journey through Infamous terrible garden
He standing somewhere in those woods
And he ready to tear your fucking ass apart man
When you walk through the wilderness be very quiet
Lord Infamous might be out stalkin'
I suggest you watch out for the booby traps man
Cause the Scarecrow is out there yea only for huntin'
You can't escape it, be a man and take it
Snatch your head up by your vertebrae
And let it with your artery shakin', penetrating your face
And bow and arrow in your bone marrow
Scarecrow, I flow, vicious, motherfuckin' tell tha ho
Tear a hoe, legs I've cut 'em up and stick em' in some purses
Lord Infamous bitch, run up,  if ya got a problem wit

[Outro: Lord Infamous]
So, so come and get some 18 so come and get some 18
So come and so come and get some 187 invitation
Burial insurance and some
Burial insurance and some
Burial insurance and some hospitalization...
So, so come and get some 18 so come and get some 18
