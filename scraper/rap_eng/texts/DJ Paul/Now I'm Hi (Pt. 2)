[Verse 1: Koopsta Knicca]
Hoe why these b-izz-ick quick to jump
To get they motherfuckin' head bump
I popped my trunk
And then I blast them tr-izz-icks with my pump
Here because of the shit that a nigga had committin'
When I hit 'em from the night before
Cause then I sworn I had to take them busta to the morgue
So sweat is low I have to go out like Charles Manson
The Koopsta committin' evil shit with the mind of satan
A motherfuckin' hard lead, nervous in the head
And yeah it's gonna be another nigga dead
Twistin' on my dreads while I'm loadin' up my milli rounds
So we can gonna spray and buck these busta bitches down
Oh cause I'm really, really tired of hearin' babbage shit
So let me hit them tricks and (?) this da Koopsta biz
The Koopsta's from the Ville where the Devil Shyt for real
My type of killa leave you burnin' in the cornfield
Because yo god got you niggas think you damn hard
I break ya apart and have a ritual in the fucking park

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
Mask to my fuckin' face, I'm fiendin to increase my high
Eyeballs is like red as hell, you bitches better recognize

Thats bitch that call me so so thick
Smoked out, loced out, playas all around
But known as Triple Six
Million blunts up in my mind, yeah my nig it's (?) time
Smoked up all the blunts and now I'm high, I'm on cloud nine
Jump trick up and fool I click, yo get yo fuckin' body bust
Bitches bodies chopped in bits
And guts and shit off in my trunk
Str-izz-apped all the time
Because some evil shit goes through my head
Bullets to your temple got you bitches dead up in the med
Bloody Glock is cocked and ready pop up on another hoe
Hollow points will have yo bitch-ass
Knockin' on the devils door
Bitches, bitches (?) back this, niggas, nigga blast me bitch
Pimpin' ... this shit because yeah bitch you know it's thick
On yo motherfuckin' ass, claim yourself a lazy bee
Doggin' all you phonky hoes, nigga you can't fuck with me
