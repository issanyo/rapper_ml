[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Nigga recognize the Triple 6 shit
It's so fuckin' thick
We gotta lay it down, we gotta spray, we gotta break ya, bitch
Coming up stays on my mind so we gotta drop a busta
A playa hatin' nigga or a crooked cop, run up
If ya wanna, It ain't no thang I put my gun up
Midnight to sun up
Still break you, mane in the M: the M-Town
Niggas get buck non stop
Fuck off and learn the real meaning of a plastic Glock
Gotta touch 'em, gotta grab 'em cause I think he's bailin'
Lay 'em down, no remorse, come with me to hell
Overnight we be rich when we tell the trick
Catch ya slippin', he's so soft, do a man quick
Killers on my payroll, I gotta stay straight
19 If us fear from work, there's no need to trade
The Three 6 Mafia real niggas know
Slaw in Memphis, Tennessee
Down to break the law, bitch

Coming up from the back, buckin' niggas down
Coming, coming up from the back, buckin' niggas down
Coming up from the back, buckin' niggas down
Cause when you duck, we hit you with the bat

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Pass me the pistol so I can get buck
A mean frown stay on my face cause I don't give a fuck
Loced out afro and a big Fila coat
14 carat gold smile and a bone around my throat
Glock 19 is tucked nicely down my fruit of the looms
For them niggas that trick it in, I'm stickin' up them tracks they boom
Shakin' like a motherfucker when I lock you down tight
In the Chevy trunk with nothing but next to dig for your life
Fool it ain't no game, you gotta die, the devil sent me
Six in yo chest, who's next?, no niceness in me
The killers up in my crew, they take no shit, niggas you better run
We bout it bitch, no nigga don't play, (we roll with automatic guns)
Step up with the ho shit, nigga we gotta close shop
Juice on the burgler do a 9 leaving you hoes to rot
Big cam with a punk, Malekie with a attitude
Smith & Wesson in his hand, blow'd the bitch out his shoes
Break the law

[Hook]

Coming up from the back, buckin' niggas down
Coming, coming up from the back, buckin' niggas down
Coming up from the back, buckin' niggas down
Cause when you duck, we hit you with the bat
Coming up from the back, buckin' niggas down
Coming, coming up from the back, buckin' niggas down
Coming up from the back, buckin' niggas down
Cause when you duck, we hit you with the bat
