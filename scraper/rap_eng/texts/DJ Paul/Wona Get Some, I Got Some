Run up in your grill, when attention who we blastin'
Now woo now we presidental thing, cause you was flashin'

Amazed what we see the crooked police harassin'
All because we makin' cheddar other clicks are lackin'
Down for the cause, where you haters wanna brawl
Got my back against the wall, Hypnotized Camp I call
We some treal figgas', drug heal niggas, makin' (?) quicker
Livin' in the world where it's hard not to kill niggas
Enemies is layin', unless they hold in tight them brain cells
Sacraficein' every chick that they can make, because of fame mama
Clean till I'm gone, like I'm ridin on the chrome
Shakin' all the playa haters, soking knowledge in my dome
