[Verse 1: Project Pat]
If you thinking I'm straight then you better think twice
And you ain't got no cheese then I'm Jekyll and Hyde
'Bout to click on this bitch cause she need to learn me
Beat her with my pistol when I thought she burned me
It's the first of the month, you can call me Sambo
I'mma dick this ho down cause I like to gamble
In her purse I ramble, on her head I trample
Where the hell the damn dough, old silly ass ho
You know green I'm gon' blow and I like to toot snow
Sippin' Yac with your cap is the perfect combo
You can be a Jane Doe if you call the po-po
(I'ma call ya momma up) Bitch that's a no no
Don't get personal, I'll never let go
If you did wanna run you'll get beat to the flo'
I'mma go-rilla pimp you can call me great ape
Knockin' teefus out ya mouth need to get ya shit straight

[Hook: Namond Lumpkin]
I'mma gorilla on the hoes, dig dat
I'mma pimp nigga you ain't know? Dig dat
I'mma a mack mane on the stroll, dig dat
I'm out here trying to make a ho, dig dat
Cause I hustle on the low, dig dat
I ain't tryin' to go for broke, dig dat
So bitch don't try me ho, dig dat
If you do I'mma cut ya throat, dig dat

[Verse 2: Pat]
Talkin' smart to a pimp you done broke the first rule
I'mma come on your job I'mma act a damn fool
When ya boss walk in I'mma play it off cool
If he step in our biz I'mma slap his ass too
All that loud talkin ho need to gon' settle down
'Fore you friend have to pick ya ass up off the ground
I got love for ya purse meaning that I love you
Married to this cheese first and I'm screamin' I do
No money for a mack mean drama for a ho
Paramedics toting you through the trauma center do'
Busted lips, broken leg, but I got my bank roll
Tried to put a struggle up so she got her eye swoll
Buying you Taco Bell but a pimp eating Steak
Corn bread, collard greens, chit-a-lings on my plate
Always late for a date and she always trippin'
She can hate my fuckin guts but she lovin' my pimpin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pat]
Mixin' game with some Yac is a deadly potion
If I hit it from the back bitch I want devotion
In ya pussy strokin', ho a pimp is spoken
DOA if you try to play my emotions
I'mma crack a ho's dome I ain't broke the damn law
'Nother nigga my phone so I broke the bitches jaw
You done quit ya damn job and you need to start hoin'
Boostin clothes playin tricks cause a pimp ain't goin
In the club shakin ass they can bring plenty cash
But ya get mo' loot with a VIP pass
Say ya ass got robbed when ya shoulda give 'em hundred?
Now you get the fuck up out of here, go and get the money
You's dummy tryin' to pop phoning me a get ya killed
Bitch I ain't the chargee I'mma charge you for real
So don't get it twisted I'm the pimp you the bitch
Either bring the loot quick or you get ya throat slit

I'mma Gorilla on the hoes...
