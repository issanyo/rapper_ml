[Riff Raff]
Yo Scottie run the triangle. Run that triangle
Rodney come here set the screen. You gotta start setting the screen
You crazy

[Hook] x2
Big ballin' in Chicago, same night
I done hit Korea on a red-eye flight
Drop top private plane with the eagles on sight
Scoring like Jordan but its only fourth quarter

Crispy clean one hundreds, what I prefer
I hit the scene shooting jumpers, Steve Kerr
The pink syrup baby bird for my purple ?
I'm in a three story mansion in the suburbs
I cause tidal waves when I surf
I could have played for the bears, Versace astro-turf
I-I-I chop the block like a lumberjack
Hopped out the Cutlass doing jumping jacks
I'm not never worried about my words
Bases loaded, guess who? Ryne Sandberg
Ki Jana Carter, the way I ball
Terry Bradshaw, Jim Harbaugh
