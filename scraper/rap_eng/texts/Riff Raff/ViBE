[Hook]
Out of body out of mind
Floating in-between the ligths
In my head I'm acting like
Ain't nobody gonna kill my vibe
Out of body out of mind
Pretty sure I'll be alright
In my head I'm acting like
Ain't nobody gonna kill my vibe
Ain't nobody gonna kill my vibe

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
First off pay off your taxes
Accountant doing back flips pockets doing gymnastics
Dropped off my 40 percent to Uncle Sam
Damn fam can't I cop the cram' Lamb
I must vacation on the regular
No behind the scenes put away your cellular
No phone service in Amsterdam
Don't touch my hand I shine my nails
I need three shots of gin in my ginger ale
Here take my keys I can't see too well
My feet need to meet the beach in East Greece
My body needs to sleep beneath Versace sheets
RiFF

[Hook]
Out of body out of mind
Floating in-between the lights
In my head I'm acting like
Ain't nobody gonna kill my vibe
Out of body out of mind
Pretty sure I'll be alright
In my head I'm acting like
Ain't nobody gonna kill my vibe
Ain't nobody gonna kill my vibe

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
Never meant to get bent out of shape
But I ain't too many steaks put on too much weight
Gained seventy pounds you could see it in my face
Lean down and I can barely tie my shoe lace
Fuck that I came back with a Gucci six pack
I don't smoke crack but I put codeine over ice
Crack the seal in Nashville spill the syrup in my Sprite
If she act right I might bring out the rice
Back to me, back to doing whatever I feel
Back to you being annoying and keeping it real
With your attitude I swear I've had it up to here
I be damned if I let these haters get in my ear
RiFF

Out of body out of mind
Pretty sure I'll be alright
In my head I'm acting like
Ain't nobody gonna kill my vibe
Ain't nobody gonna kill my vibe
