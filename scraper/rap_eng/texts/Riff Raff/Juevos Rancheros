[Hook: Meyhem Laruen]

I'm in the zone right, chrome right, cream gotta get it
Hard body pump shotty in the trunk my niggas live it
Rep my city so the team is from New Yitty on my fitted
Another day another dollar, hustle scholar gotta get it
I'm in the zone right, chrome right, cream gotta get it
Hard body pump shotty in the trunk my niggas live it
Rep my city so the team is from New Yitty on my fitted
Another day another dollar, hustle scholar gotta get it

[Verse 1: AG Da Coroner]

Muthafuckas is fake, make 'em drop to they knees
Stretched out in the forest laying next to them trees
Should of ran fast like he spotted the D's
Salute to the generals, salute to the G's
Real niggas do real things when chasing the cheese
Everything comes back 360 degrees
What y'all little niggas know about chopping some keys
Have your bitch ass mutt niggas scratching your fleas
Hard work always pay off, never taking a day off
Sixteen in the clip I'm letting about eight off
That means half off, always ready to blast off
Break both your arms, you never taking the casts off
We so serious, yall so delirious
Face all bloody, ate her out on her period
Animalistic linguistic statistics
Showing that some y'all saw the boat but most of y'all missed it

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]

Trust me, it could get ugly
Action in Flushing
I'm hushing a reprecussion could get disgusting
But rush in the 550 outside
Strawberry cream on the beamer and you figured it was blood
Let's get rancid, I'm at the Hamptons
Your flame has vanished I'm gambling the casino I just had landed
30 racks on blackjack Kobe Bryant and Steve Francis
The franchise player glow in the dark like Darth Vader
All these haters are aggravators but they suck like life savers
And I should of been a politician, possibly the mayor
Might swing decatur 40 bricks the Winnebago
Honey mustard Caravan look like a spray tan
Competition getting sacked Michael Strahan
Fucking with that Meyhem, ice on wrist like sprained hand
I heard I drop 40 grand candied yam on Trans am

Respect the fly shit

[Hook: Meyhem Laruen]

I'm in the zone right chrome right cream gotta get it
Hard body pump shotty in the trunk my niggas live it
Rep my city so the team is from New Yitty on my fitted
Another day another dollar hustle scholar gotta get it
I'm in the zone right chrome right cream gotta get it
Hard body pump shotty in the trunk my niggas live it
Rep my city so the team is from New Yitty on my fitted
Another day another dollar hustle scholar gotta get it

[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]

Bagged a shorty at the Gucci store, peace to John Stockton
Outdoorsmen in the building got this rap game locked in
Niggas got work, you can say that we clocked in
Get your faced boxed in, the G code is my doctrine
What's poppin
Niggas know the muthafuckin' drill
I'm known for silk shirts, desserts and puttin salmon on the grill, What!
Rockin belts with interlocking G buckles
After fucking us, your bitch gets in your bed and she chuckles
Even though her throat is tender and her mouth is like a blender
You should know her love for you is artificial like Splenda
I've never been a spender, bum bitch I ain't tricking
I'm from Queens where bumping Kool G Rap is a tradition

[Verse 4: Heems]

Yo people think we funny man
Me I'm the money man
Im about my money like a muthafuckin armored van
Fuckin with my money then you fuckin with my master plan
I'm a van, I'm a ground
Put it down like every town
I don't write between the lines
I'm too busy bumpin' lines
I'm about my money like a muhfuckin' fed
People follow me like the muhfuckin' dead
But I'm so grateful, mami say I'm hateful
But she is a mouthful, your girl that fly? Doubtful
Catch me up in Floral Park, Zendon Hamilton
Hammer spin, dollars off
Lights, action, flashin' and
Lampin' in the flashiest fashions
Maxin' in the mansion, bashin' anything that's happenin'
Yo, yo, yo it's Heems man
Nothing matters, matter splatters
Marshall Mathers
I'm a fuckin' legend, call me Dan Rathers
Himanshu!
Himanshu Suri! Government!
