[Intro: blackbear]
Better turn that shit down, about to get loud
Yeah
Beartrap sound

[Hook: blackbear]
Yeah
I outdo myself every time I outdo myself, yeah
I outdo myself, I came up I ain't need no help, yeah
I ain't even keeping score
I got girls now, I need whores
I outdo myself everytime I outdo myself, yeah
I even outdid myself when I tried something else, yeah
Police knocking at my door
Cause' I got money but I need more

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Lemon Lamb, webcam
Spray tan, face plant
Face plant
Summer plans
I need bands in advance
Frozen hands, oh man
Don't touch my hands
Security tackle his ass
Grab the badge (let go)
Pink Ferrari pumped by the stove
Paid in cash, Stacy my dash
RiFF to the RAFF
Blackbear, constantly takin' it over the top
Constantly takin' the roof of my drop
Even when it's not hot
When the time I pull off the lot
In the butterscotch drop
Sure I'm cold when I'm pushin' out smoke
50k hanging off my throat
Don't talk to me unless I know
Don't talk to me if I don't know
Cool blue jewels hangin' off of my tooth
Codeine toothpaste in my bathroom
7 am, we're taking vodka shower shots
Whether you like it or not

[Hook: blackbear]
Yeah
I outdo myself every time I outdo myself, yeah
I outdo myself, I came up I ain't need no help, yeah
I ain't even keeping score
I got girls now, I need whores
I outdo myself everytime I outdo myself, yeah
I even outdid myself when I tried something else, yeah
Police knocking at my door
Cause' I got money but I need more

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
I remember when I wasn't part of the conversation (no)
Now I'm on my prime, man
I'm gonna fucking make it (make it)
I'ma fuckin' make it
Man, I'ma fuckin' make it
And if I don't make it, man
I'ma fuckin' take it (take it)
And everybody round' me, I swear they wanna see me fail
Then I try to tell em' man, I'm the way I set myself
Now, I'm seeing on these checks when I check the mail
It's that clockwork, man it ain't never fail
I'm as focused in I ever, ever, ever been
I'm tryna' pop the Lambo outside of my crib
It ain't no secret, bitch go tell a friend (tell a friend)
Money, money, money, money, til' the end

[Hook: blackbear]
Yeah
I outdo myself every time I outdo myself, yeah
I outdo myself, I came up I ain't need no help, yeah
I ain't even keeping score
I got girls now, I need whores
I outdo myself everytime I outdo myself, yeah
I even outdid myself when I tried something else, yeah
Police knocking at my door
Cause' I got money but I need more
