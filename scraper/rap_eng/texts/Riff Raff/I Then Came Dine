I then came dine

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Had to put the Forgiato wheels on the ride
Bout to leave my dick way deep in her mind
Just did a song with my nigga Bun B
I wish I would've got a chance to meet Pimp C
Pour Big Moe all in my damn cup
I done came down in the damn trophy truck
I might bust a right, might bust a damn left
You can catch me ridin' slab by my mothafuckin' self

[Hook]

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
Should I ride 'Lac? I could ride black
I done came down with Versace backpack
Pink lemonade, chillin' in the shade
Got kicked out the 8th grade for playin' with a razorblade
Baller berry soup, name on my suit
Ice so blue I done damn near caught the flu
They wanna see me fold, hard rose gold
Maybe made the thunder, maybe Kurt Angle
Broke the boys off, Rolex on my ankle
Listen to RiFF RAFF, I can make my trunk crack
I done came down with the candy Apple Jack
Maybe need some Benjamins, mothafuck a Benz
Mothafuck a trend, aquaberry Lam with the hyper white lens
Drove through a hurricane and didn't spill my drank
JODY HiGHROLLER weigh about a army tank
I weigh about tornado multiplied by the Sun

[Hook]
