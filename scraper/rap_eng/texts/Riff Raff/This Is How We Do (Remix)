[Intro]
Uh, Riff Raff, Katy Perry, yeah we do it like that

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Sipping on Rosé
Silverlake sun coming up all lazy (This is how we do)
Slow cooking pancakes for my boy
Still up, still fresh as a daisy
Playing ping pong all night long
Everything's all neon and hazy
Chanel this, Chanel that
Hell yeah, all my girls vintage Chanel, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
It's no big deal
It's no big deal
It's no big deal
This is no big deal

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
This is how we do
This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
This is how we do

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Big hoops, and maroon lips
My clique hopping in my Maserati
Santa Barbara-chic at La Super Rica
Grabbing tacos, checking out hotties
Now we talkin’ astrology
Getting our nails did all Japanese-y
Day drinking at the Wildcat
Sucking real bad at Mariah Carey-oke

[Pre-Chorus]
It's no big deal
It's no big deal
It's no big deal
This is no big deal

[Chorus]
This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
This is how we do
This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
This is how we do

[Verse 3: RiFF RAFF]
Rap game Ted Koppel in Versace boxers
I valeted the chopper on top of Red Lobster (RiFF RAFF)
Who’s startin’? (Katy Perry) Who’s parkin’ the Aston Martin?
Caddy-cornered in Neiman Marcus
Moon roof, Grey Goose, Bentley Coupe doing Kung-Fu
Rap game Dr. Drew for example, I pull up in the Lambo (Damn)
Both hands glow, Roman candles
Uh, now I’m Larry Flint with a candy blimp
Champagne filled the sink and my drink is pink (Okay)
Now I’m overseas speaking Japanese (Japanese, Japanese)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's no big deal
It's no big deal
It's no big deal
This is no big deal

[Chorus]
This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
This is how we do
This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
This is how we do

[Outro: Katy Perry]
Wait… no, no, no, no bring the beat back
(Bring it back)
That’s right
(This is how we do)
Oh, oh
(This is how we do)
Oh, oh
