[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
Haters can't stand me, should've won a Grammy
I done came down, got more publishin' than Bambi
Haters can't stand me, can't stand me
Yeah these haters can't stand me, haters can't stand me
Haters can't stand me, should've won a Grammy
I done came down, got more publishin' than Bambi
Haters can't stand me, haters can't stand me
Yeah these haters can't stand me, man I should've won a Grammy

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Don't get confused, Princess Leia jewels
Jumped out the coupe with Versace parachute
Sailor Jerry shoes and the tint navy blue
Rap game Langston Hughes in the candy chartreuse
Hotter than a soup bowl, fresh up out of JuCo (Swish!)
Down in Yugoslavia, shootin' jumpers, Toni Kukoƒç
Crawfish Boudreaux, cordon bleu
360 windmill with 8 rocks up in my shoes
OJ Simpson, I'm the head honcho
Could've played for Toronto, but they found a dead body in the back of my Bronco
Riff Raff for mayor, Jody president
I should've won a Grammy for all of this ice up under my chin

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I got my face on the drug pen, put me in your mouth
Cake's up in the oven, keep the burners in the couch
Lakers versus Celtics, hoggin' up two floor seats
Cause I'm selfish, melted butter on the shellfish
Knife right by the pelvis, dancing like Hispanics
Pull up in the Ghostbuster, candy, Rick Moranis
Gold Rollie sit on the wrist like turkey sandwich
Run the 40 in 4 flat
Way faster than a horse jack
