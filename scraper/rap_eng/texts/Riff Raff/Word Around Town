[Intro: RiFF RaFF]
Word around town
Word around town I ain't never turning down

[Hook: RiFF RaFF]
Word around town I just bought a house
Word around town I got Versace berry couch
Word around town I ain't never turning down
Smoked a half a pound, fell asleep on the ground
Word around town I just bought a house
Word around town I got Versace berry couch
Word around town I ain't never turning down
Smoked a half a pound, fell asleep on the ground

[Verse 1: RiFF RaFF]
All alone, sharpe skin tone
Riding around Rome trying to buy a new home
All the hate, all the games that they play
I might move out the USA
Should I Swahili? Rose gold Benz
Word around town I'm the Aquaberry Prince
Rainbow diamonds behind black licorice tint
Last time you seen me I was jumping out the gym
Signed a contract like John Paxson
Went to PetCo and bought a neon green rabbit
So I could save my phone battery after dark
In my fish tank glow in the dark street sharks

[Hook: RiFF RaFF]
Word around town I just bought a house
Word around town I got Versace berry couch
Word around town I ain't never turning down
Smoked a half a pound, fell asleep on the ground
Word around town I just bought a house
Word around town I got Versace berry couch
Word around town I ain't never turning down
Smoked a half a pound, fell asleep on the ground

[Verse 2: Choo Jackson]
Word around town is I'm lit as a bitch
I'ma buy a new car, I'ma paint it peppermint
Shit you know I'm heaven sent, don't you ever talk no shit
And the diamonds on my wrist look like lasers on my shit
Stack it like Legos, take your bitch to Barbados
Tryna save the money but I spend it for my ego
If it's for my people, I could fly it like a eagle
I'ma go and get a bad bitch from Toledo
If it's bout the check then you know it's all that
Pull up with my boy, you know it's a foreign
Check your game points cause you know we scoring
Yeah I'm balling, you could call my Jordan

[Hook: RiFF RaFF]
Word around town I just bought a house
Word around town I got Versace berry couch
Word around town I ain't never turning down
Smoked a half a pound, fell asleep on the ground
Word around town I just bought a house
Word around town I got Versace berry couch
Word around town I ain't never turning down
Smoked a half a pound, fell asleep on the ground
