[Chorus: Riff Raff]
Crab Cazals in a snow storm
My name's running hot, global warming
Neon pythons, both arms
Ice on my hand look like a snow storm
Ice on my hand look like a snow storm
Ice on my hand look like a snow storm
Name running hot, global warming
Ice on my hand look like a snow storm

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Had to reveal on em
Made four mill on em
Polar bear ankles had to chill on em
You need to chill homie
I don't Snapchat
When I'm in public take a picture of not with
Teriyaki shrimp I had to grill on em
Lemon-lime lamb had to veil on em
Had to reveal on em
Robbers look like peach cobbler
I pull up out in Scotland in that Green Goblin
Crab Cazals with the gold crest
You ain't seen these cause they ain't out yet
My Rolex melts
Left the couch wet
Like a porpoise, I'm in corpus
FedEx doorstep, rose gold corvette
Buscemi basketball goal with the Porsche net
When I retire
Hawaiian Punch sunsets
I always get mistaked for Alanis Morrisette

[Chorus: Riff Raff]
Crab Cazals in a snow storm
My name's running hot, global warming
Neon pythons, both arms
Ice on my hand look like a snow storm
Ice on my hand look like a snow storm
Ice on my hand look like a snow storm
Name running hot, global warming
Ice on my hand look like a snow storm

[Verse 2: Owey]
I'm coming all blue hundreds while I fuck bank tellers
I just spent a hundred thousand [?]
Make sure they vacuum-sealed so the dog don't smell em
Yeah, your wife is my bitch
What? that bitch ain't tell ya
Two white girls skin, let them hoes take a dab
Crossing over on niggas, bitch, I'm like Allen Ive
Flying off the [?] with my dawg, Poodeezy
I'm kicking all kinds of trill, boy, this shit too easy
Sipping Actavis Syrup with Riff
We got dessert and shit
Watch how I curve your bitch, let's get it
Got two Rollies on my wrist I rock on both arms
I hit the coke with the hammer, watch it snow storm

[Chorus: Riff Raff]
Crab Cazals in a snow storm
My name's running hot, global warming
Neon pythons, both arms
Ice on my hand look like a snow storm
Ice on my hand look like a snow storm
Ice on my hand look like a snow storm
Name running hot, global warming
Ice on my hand look like a snow storm

[Verse 3: Poodeezy]
I refill the Benz and got a mansion
I knew it would, I pick on niggas like a scab, yeah
Got real money, ain't get nothing off a scam yet
Got real choppers, say [?] Vietnam, yeah
Aye, call me Swaggy P got 23 like Jordan
Aye, fear of god [?]
Aye, Rollie on my arm this ain't no Michael Kors
Big ass rings and [?]
