[Intro: Tracy]
Skrrt
RiFF
Yeah yeah

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
I have ice all across my hand
I have traveled to foreign land
I have ice all across my hand
I have traveled to foreign land
I have ice all across my hand
I have traveled to foreign land
I have ice all across my hand
I have traveled to foreign land
I have ice all across my hand

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Uh, yeah, uh
Big baller don't wait, uh
Diamonds all over my face
Ferragamo on waist
Maserati on the way
Forty-five on my waist, just in case
Could’ve signed with Tulane, Burberry briefcase
I shoot a jumper like Tim Legler
I shoot a jumper like Steve Kerr
I parked the Bentley on the curb
I pour a four in a hurricane
I put a brick in the passenger
Just in case I might buy me a new plane
I made you double the price
I made you double your ice
Jody ain't got no wife
I need to buy more ice
I need more syrup than Sprite
I got a dirty cup
Teeth is princess cut
Chain is Halle hus'
Only ten of us, Prada tour bus, RiFF

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
I have ice all across my hand
I have traveled to foreign land
I have ice all across my hand
I have traveled to foreign land
I have ice all across my hand
I have traveled to foreign land
I have ice all across my hand
I have traveled to foreign land
I have ice all across my hand

[Verse 2: Tracy & RiFF RAFF]
You can skate on it, figure eight on it
I say, "Я тебя люблю" to my Russian bitch (I love you)
And she love that shit (Yeah)
Then she suck my (Woo, okay)
Big ass rims on my ride (Big rims)
If I jump out the roof, I’ma die (That's suicide)
I'm not no farmer but my cars got horsepower
Sour Patch paint job got these boys sour (RiFF)

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
I have ice all across my hand
I have travelled to foreign land
I have ice all across my hand
I have travelled to foreign land
I have ice all across my hand
I have travelled to foreign land
I have ice all across my hand
I have travelled to foreign land

[Outro: Tracy]
