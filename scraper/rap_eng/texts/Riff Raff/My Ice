[Intro]
My ice, my ice, my ice, my ice
My ice, my ice, my ice
My ice, my ice, my ice

[Hook]
When it's cold outside and I rock my ice
When it's hot outside, still rock my ice
My ice, my ice, my ice
My ice, my ice, my ice
When it's cold outside and I rock my ice
When it's hot outside, still rock my ice
My ice, my ice, my ice
My ice, my ice, my ice

[Verse 1]
Not bad, drop Jag
Paper tag on the back
I was gon' leave five stacks but valet scratched my bag
I'm addicted to foreigns, rocking Ralph Lauren
Could've been stage touring, it's the white Martin Lawrence
Like a drunk doctor, I lost my patients
Started to hate waiting, Cadillac Escaladed
I'm at the Trump Towers on the escalator
If it ain't about the paper, I'ma see you later
I rock more ice than a figure skater
When Gucci got out, I had to call my jeweler
But don't get confused, my wrist is a zoo
All my diamonds are see through blue, RiFF

[Hook]
When it's cold outside and I rock my ice
When it's hot outside, still rock my ice
My ice, my ice, my ice
My ice, my ice, my ice
When it's cold outside and I rock my ice
When it's hot outside, still rock my ice
My ice, my ice, my ice
My ice, my ice, my ice

[Verse 2]
[?] right back at the state park
Parked outside of Fort Knox, Porsche Boxster [?]
Four tube socks filled with solid gold blocks
Paint wetter than a mop as I proceed to chop blocks
White ice man diamonds big as a knee pad
91 surpreme gas mango matte Maybach
Shot more jumpers than Scott Skiles, aquaberry smiles
They tried to steal my style but I was rocking reptile
It's the versatile crocodile, Iceberg Simpson [?]
I'm eating shrimp on my burberry blimp
I'm addicted to foreigns, rocking Ralph Lauren
Could've been stage touring, it's the white Martin Lawrence

[Hook]
When it's cold outside and I rock my ice
When it's hot outside, still rock my ice
My ice, my ice, my ice
My ice, my ice, my ice
When it's cold outside and I rock my ice
When it's hot outside, still rock my ice
My ice, my ice, my ice
My ice, my ice, my ice
