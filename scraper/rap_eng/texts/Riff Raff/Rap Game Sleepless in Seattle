[Hook: Riff Raff]
Yeah, Versace baby rattle
Versace baby rattle, got me sleepless in Seattle
Sleepless in Seattle and I ain't about the cheap talk
The way I ball could'a played for the Seahawks

Yeah, Versace baby rattle
Versace baby rattle, got me sleepless in Seattle
Sleepless in Seattle and I ain't about the cheap talk
The way I ball could'a played for the Seahawks

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Yeah, and I'm sittin' on the Ken Griff's
Griffey Junior, Griffey Senior in the limousine-ah
Hide a whole bottle of Zima in the Aquafina
She got a fat ass, pull over like Trina
Ain't no misdemeanor, I thinkin' Versace bent
The way I ball, rap game Shawn Kemp
Craig Sagar, and she in the candy search
I come through with more sacks than Brian Bosworth
Frost up on 'em skatin' and I got 'em hatin'
Versace on my gloves, rap game Gary Payton, watch me
Yeah, watch me swing the cattle
All this rice up in my saddle, got me sleepless in Seattle
Riff

[Verse 2: DollaBillGates]
Smokin' SuperSonic chronic just like Shawn Kemp (Bugatti)
Should I make it rain or pay my mama's rent
I had to buy the Benz cause this ain't cheap talk (No)
Park it at the stadium and watch the Seahawks
It's rainin' but I still get a car wash (skirt!)
And when you dry it make sure you use Versace cloth
A vintage scarf just to clean the engine dog
When I park it leave that motherfucker runnin' dog
I was sleepless in Seattle, bitches fuckin' with me
Condo downtown, right next to King Griffey
I can see the whole state from the balcony
If it ain't big money I got allergies
