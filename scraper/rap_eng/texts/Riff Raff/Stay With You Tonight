[Verse 1: Clinton Sparks]
Can I stay with you tonight?
Cause I don't think that I'm alright
I need to find a piece of mind
Cause I'm messed up just by design
And I don't even trust myself
And baby, I could use your help
What's on your mind, girl, let me know
I don't really wanna go, go, go 'cause
I'm not into leaving
I'll be scratching, kicking, screaming
Girl, I'm feeling

[Hook: Clinton Sparks]
Can I stay with you tonight?
Can I stay with you tonight?
And we'll do something that's not right
Can I stay with you tonight?
I wanna stay with you!

[Verse 2: Clinton Sparks]
You might be just as fucked as me
But I still need some company
Maybe we'll take each other down
And we can face down on the ground, ground 'cause
I'll be so mistreated
I'll be scratching, kicking, screaming
Girl, I'm feeling

[Hook: Clinton Sparks]
Can I stay with you tonight?
Can I stay with you tonight?
And we'll do something that's not right
Can I stay with you tonight?
I wanna stay with you!

[Verse 3: RiFF RAFF]
OK! RiFF!
Who's this? The kid with the blue wrist (blue)
Cutting coke on a table with a sword fish (damn)
I promised myself one thing
Married to the success, keep the diamond ring
She on me, wants me to stay in (stay in)
I'm too drunk but I'm swanging in the golden Benz
Pouring more than water, sure thing behind tints
Flashbacks over high school ball gym
Now I'm just high with a school of women
Girl, me and you were supposed to be just friends
Had sex one time, then you moved in (what?)
Now we fucked up something on your girlfriend
RiFF, RiFF

[Hook: Clinton Sparks]
Can I stay with you tonight?
And we'll do something that's not right
Can I stay with you tonight?
I wanna stay with you!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna stay with you!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Can I stay with you?
