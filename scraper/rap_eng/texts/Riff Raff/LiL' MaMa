[Intro: Riff Raff]

Yeah, this song goes out to
To all the girls
That I accidently broke the hearts
And it goes out to
All the ones that realized I Purposely borke they hearts

(Never meant to hurt you. Never meant to hurt you, never-never meant to hurt you, never. never)

[Hook: Riff Raff]
Lil mama I'm sorry
I never meant to ball like this
And who would expect
I'd be in a drop top 6 or Ferrari
Lil mama I'm sorry
(repeat 1x)

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
(ugh, ugh)
Hot summer
Workin' lumber in my stretch Plumb hummer
Workin wheels
Poppin pills
Showcasin' my skills
Will I make 20mill?
Only time will tell
I'mma ball at the mall
Shuttin' down the sea wall
40 karats 'cross my jaws
Just in case they don't trust me
MC Hammer can't touch me
Your freestyle is disgusting
Make 'em mad Glad Lock bags in the Toucan Sam Jag
Droppin bombs
Like Saddam
Settin' off car alarms
Might pull up in Milan
In the drop candy swan
Might swing through ya prom
With the wand in my palm
I'mma lie to your mom
Make her made at ya dad
50 days
50 nights
Codeine in the sprite
Might throw some diamonds
On my hand
Diamonds on handkerchiefs
Pour a 4 inside my pacreas
Got Diamonds on dental
I'mma swing the instrumental
I'mma break a 2 pencil
2 a 3
1 for keys
Make it OOC

[Hook x2]
