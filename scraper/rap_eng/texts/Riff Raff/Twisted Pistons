[Hook: Ghetty & Riff Raff]

[Ghetty]
Ballin', might get drafted by the NBA
Ballin', might get drafted by the NBA

[Riff Raff]
I mean I coulda' played for the Pistons, but don't get it twisted
I mean I coulda' played for the Pistons, but don't get it twisted

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Ya, might be Dan Marino, Al Pacino
Now I'm out in Denver, John Elway
Too many blades, that's what the scale say
Now I'm underwater where the whales play
My house, Louis Vuitton print on my couch
Security Guard touch screen iPad
Finger print scan on my Jag'
My Jag', my Jag', my Jag'
'Bout to switch lanes like Terry Porter
Got Versace on my camcorder
Icy white teeth, like Farrah Fawcett
Gucci pockets, smiles like Isiah Thomas

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ghetty]
Look I shoulda started for the Pacers, the way I ball on these haters
The way I'm balling like Kobe, shit I should start for the Lakers
Like Shawn Kemp I'm supersonic
Out in Cali blowing super chronic
Fast break, don't care who's behind me
I run the city like Giuliani, Uh
Call me Gary Payton way I come through skating
Boys that's hating, hesitation
Tell the Colts run an iso
Balling hard, where the price go
No look, alley oop to Riff Raff
Hell yeah, he brought the rice out
I'm on the court and you on the bench
You got a drop, I'll make her wet
You wanna gamble, let's make a bet
You broke as hell, I'm number net
I'm Steve Kirk, I'm John Paxson
You getting traded like Steven Jackson
Straight to the rack, let's get it cracking
Hard in the paint, I ain't passing, huh
