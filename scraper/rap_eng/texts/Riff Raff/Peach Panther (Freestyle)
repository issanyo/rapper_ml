[Intro]
Hello American citizens
Be very cautious in these trying times
Notice how men deserting other men
Not only hurting other women
I suggest you take safe precautions
And stay away from men at all cost
Me myself personally I'm going into protection mode
Should any mans try to touch myself
I would hate to have to use brute physical force
To remove you from my presence
Good Day America, good day indeed
(Laughing)

[Verse]
Riff... Jodie
Got more ice than a snow fox
3 wheel through Jack in the box, half a brick in my sock
Hook like Joe Frazier, house on Green Acres
I can make a shavers aqua velvet street skater
Codeine in my blender
Bring Bring! Who is it?
Collect call from Bruce Jenner
The syrup sippin' chef
Versace on my shelf
I'm about to do a photo shoot
Call the paparazzi for some help

My car speaking Israeli
Pop trunk on Antoine, I let it down on Katie
Katy Mills Mall
Watch that boy ball
Spent 80 grand just take a damn nap at the Taj Mahal
Don't ask me for no favors
Diamonds are appraisal
Used to Dark Daze 'em
Junior High I went through a phase of spray paintin Neon Raisins
Riff!
