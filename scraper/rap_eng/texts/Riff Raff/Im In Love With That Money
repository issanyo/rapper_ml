[Hook: Peter Jackson]
I'm in love with that money
I'm in love with that kitty
"I'm in love with that paper, daddy"
I'm in love with that fetti
I'm in love with them greenbacks
I'm in love with them dollars
I'm in love with them 20s 50s 100s
Don't eat just holla
Look
I'm in love with that money
I'm in love with that kitty
"I'm in love with that paper, daddy"
I'm in love with that fetti
I'm in love with them greenbacks
I'm in love with them dollars
I'm in love with them 20s 50s 100s
Don't eat just holla

[Verse 1: Peter Jackson]
L.K. on my
30 thou in my pocket
All 20s, that's clean money
I know young'n, it's shocking
Look, I been through with that hustle
Now I'm watching it double
I don't know what y'all doing but
We making it bubble
It's a long stretch for that kitty
Baby dance for that fetti
I'm that YG, I'm that young king
Look mama said
25 on that work, 8 days on that turf
See them crows who wanna ride away
Well tell Long John I don't surf
Really 'bout it, I do it
Stinkin' clean, I'm a shoe-in
We living right, you just talk about it
Lil fuck boy ain't do it
I don't need praise, I don't need props
I don't need a chain, I don't need a watch
I copped the rings, then I copped a drop
Then I popped a bottle, yeah mazeltov
Oh you really do it? Well I beg my pardon
My god, I'll steal his coffin
Anyone wanna talk this shit round here?
Don't get them young boys started
See I foam when I spit
And I smoke a lot of weed
So I'm looking like I'm half retarded
Thousand grams on the table
300 shots later, I am your father

[Hook]

[Verse 2: OJ da Juiceman]
I been standing in the kitchen all god damn day
'Bout to cook 40 bricks of the fishscale yay
Got so many grams like they
Call me weight watcher because the way I get off weight
I'm a distributor traffic yay from state to state
Err'body bosses, err'body same place
Keep my grams low so I can focus on the state
Been setting trends so these niggas gon hate
I'm gon stack my paper sit my '71 on '8s
Pull up in the hood get my car washed by my babe
Stay what's up to Steve Texaco shawty straight
32 ENT Cash Money aye
Hundred cocaine Peter Jackson eating steaks
We gon get this money and remix all the shake
Hundred cocaine Peter Jackson eating steaks
We gon get this money and remix all the shake

[Verse 3: Riff Raff]
A price scam: my ice is priceless
I'm legendary shooting dice with Mark Price, bitch
It's 5 twice 2 twice 7 boy dope (Jordan)
It's Paul Pierce
Diamond ears cause a frostbite (frostbite)
A nice night (night, I'm not nice), my aim is precise
I'm Glen Rice, I'm Glenn Close: it's a close call (close call)
A empty call log, yeah I'm a ball hog
I fake pass, I'm headed to the basket
I gotta, I gotta take mine
I don't take nine fifty to a half time
I turn tables, my syrup candy maple
Jody Highroller, lady luck is in my favor
I-I-I chop a brick with a neon razor (whaaat)
Riff Raff came through in a Mercury Sable
I-I-I chop a brick with a neon razor (whaaat)
Riff Raff came through in a Mercury Sable
