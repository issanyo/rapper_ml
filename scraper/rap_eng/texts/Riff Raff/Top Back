[Intro]
Came back, top that
In my top back in my top, my top back, top
DJ Afterthought, bitch!

[Chorus]
Yo, on top back with my top, top back
My top back with my top, with my top back
With my top back
Came back
With my top back
Uh, my top back with my top, top back
My top back with my top, with my top back
With my top back
Came back
With my top back

[Verse 1]
Uh, suckers still hate, then they still my style
But I'm versatile as Versace Golden Child
Still popping pills, still working wheels
A-screen's on watching King of the Hill
Money ain't gonna stop, trunks gonna unlock
Thunderstorm warning but I still drop the top
Yo, raise three feet of snow, money gonna grow
I can smell haters when I walk through the door
Might sip a fo', I can sip an eight
I done hang-glided off the damn Golden Gate
Uh, Golden Gate bridge, what I done did
When I was a kid, codeine stains on my bib
Check my outfit, can't find my script
Purple diamonds on fist, got an Actavis wrist
It's the young RiFF, gotta get specific
I done [?] through the damn Pacific

[Chorus]
Top back with my top, top back
My top back with my top, with my top back
With my top back
Came back
With my top back
Uh, man, top back with my top, top back
My top back with my top, with my top back
With my top back
Came back
With my top back

[Verse 2]
Yo, watch me watch TV
Can't y'all 3D margarita screen
Screens gonna shake, mics gonna break
Tornado earthquake, cage [?] steak
Can't make mistakes, cost too much money
Can't waste time, my Rolex is lemon line
It's a Sprite can, frozen time hand
Speaker's Jackie Chan, Trump's Van Damme

[Chorus]
Top back with my top, top back
My top back with my top, with my top back
With my top back
Came back
With my top back
Uh, man, my top back with my top, top back
My top back with my top, with my top back
With my top back
Came back
With my top back

[Outro]
Came back with my top back
Came back
Came back top back
