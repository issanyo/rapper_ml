[Chorus]
We be the illest
We be the illest in here
I know you feel us
We be the illest in here
Illest in here
We so muthafuckin' ill!

[Verse 1: Kev Nish]
Yeh, I be Illin' out from LA, I be illin' out all the way
Got a v-mail from my K-Town chick that wanna hook up and blaze
I got OG cannabis (can I bust?), girl, one puff will put you in your grave
Got three pills and four jimmy hats, cause we don't kid and play
Popov, yo, guess who's getting drunk, no muthafuckas can't out-drink us
If you sipping that hate, don't get drowned, so cold polar bears on my nuts
Y'all know who we be, I hold it down for the East
Cause I keeps it pimpin', Peter Griffin, yellow tinted on Z's

[Bridge: J-Splif]
Drippin' on yo couches
Drippin' on yo couches
Sippin' Tanqueray with Orange Bang we on that Tropicana
Drippin' on yo couches
From the hills to public housing
If you feelin' ill then damn you ill
Be the illest on a thousand

[Chorus]
We be the illest
We be the illest in here
I know you feel us
We be the illest in here
Illest in here
We so muthafuckin' ill!

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
Yeah, nice chain, what a nice night
My ice bright, I play the wall like a night-light
Tangerine tambourine from the West Wing
The best thing about my room? Versace bed springs
I'm in the building, more gold than Rumpelstiltskin
Aw shit, look who it is: the white Russell Simmons
Jody Highroller, Far East Movement
We so ill, I think I need some codeine fluid
Riff!

[Bridge: J-Splif]
Drippin' on yo couches
Drippin' on yo couches
Sippin' Tanqueray with Orange Bang we on that Tropicana
Drippin' on yo couches
From the hills to public housing
If you feelin' ill then damn you ill
Be the illest on a thousand

[Chorus]
We be the illest
We be the illest in here
I know you feel us
We be the illest in here
Illest in here
We so muthafuckin' ill!

[Outro: Prohgress]
"I" is for the way these beezies love how I bang
And "double L" is for the way I blow that smoke in ya face
We roll on "E's" and we be easy rollin that bank
And "ST" is for the Illest shit we rep every day
