Catch me gettin' plastered, yeah, bustin' out the plastic, yeah
Catch us gettin' plastered, too much money, I can't stack it

[Chorus: Ricki Rich]
Ooh, rackades in the attic, Jody bringin' out the Pateks
I got chickens in the kitchen, we got birds stuffed in the mattress
No we do not cuff these bitches, get 'em plastered then we pass 'em
You can catch us gettin' plastered, this a two door automatic, yeah
Catch us gettin' plastered, ooh, flooded out the Patek, yeah
Catch us gettin' plastered, yeah, I let 12 have it, ooh (Yeah)

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
I just flew back from Croatia
Pool side, I was eatin' crustaceans
Money don't make me
Yeah, but big money got me needin' no favors
Big baller make statements
Bitch ass haters on Instagram hatin'
You still live with your granny
She wonder why you Photoshopped yourself in Miami
All I want is eye candy
Last week I tip-toed like Bambi
She told me her real name
Flew to Elliante, I copped me a new chain
I don't like humans
But dealin' with the plug got me speakin' in Cuban (RiFF)
Half my family is Jewish
But shit, I ain't even knew it
Three wheel ancient ruins
But I ain't even done knowed it
Where the coke is? Lime lotus, my bank account exploded
Benz fully loaded
Bases loaded, I'ma ice out my shoulders
Froze my fist
RAFF, RAFF RiFF, poured a six in my Sunkist

[Chorus: Ricki Rich]
Ooh, rackades in the attic, Jody bringin' out the Pateks
I got chickens in the kitchen, we got birds stuffed in the mattress
