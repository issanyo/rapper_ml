[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah, alright, cool
Alright, it's working
Uh, yeah, uh
Robin wing, uh, yeah, uh

[Chorus]
Robin wings on the back of my jean
Dukes of Hazzard on the back of my screen
Sleep-walkin' just to sip some codeine
Last week, fell asleep on the triple beam
Two-thirty on the digital scale
Burly boys, ship birds to the clientele
All my fans wanna see me ball
Spent 10K, take a nap at the Taj Mahal

[Verse]
Fell asleep with the Bentley on cruise control
Valet tour bus outside of Pappadeaux
Off-white brick look like clam chowder
Pockets filled with sour and gun powder
Early flight, so I better stay up
Pilot asked me to pour him another cup
Fell asleep until I woke up
Flight attendant gon' fill up my double cup
Actavis and I copped from Big Tuck
Purple stuff, I don't fuck with no Robituss'
Jody Highroller I bet it ain't luck
Fubu briefcase filled up with Milwaukee Bucks

[Chorus]
Robin wings on the back of my jean
Dukes of Hazzard on the back of my screen
Sleep-walkin' just to sip some codeine
Last week, fell asleep on the triple beam
Two-thirty on the digital scale
Burly boys, ship birds to the clientele
All my fans wanna see me ball
Spent 10K, take a nap at the Taj Mahal

[Verse 2]
Back of the fridge like a Sunny Delight
I pour a three in a funny colored Sprite
It's the white Dolemite
I pour a deuce at the stoplight
Before it change, cell phone rang
50K is some pocket change
I swang the block like orangutan
Top down when it rain
Everybody questions harassin'
Send 'em an invoice right before they ask it
Codeine colored casket
Weavin' through traffic, could've played for the Mavericks

[Chorus]
Robin wings on the back of my jean
Dukes of Hazzard on the back of my screen
Sleep-walkin' just to sip some codeine
Last week, fell asleep on the triple beam
Two-thirty on the digital scale
Burly boys, ship birds to the clientele
All my fans wanna see me ball
Spent 10K, take a nap at the Taj Mahal
Robin wings on the back of my jean
Dukes of Hazzard on the back of my screen
Sleep-walkin' just to sip some codeine
Last week, fell asleep on the triple beam
Two-thirty on the digital scale
Burly boys, ship birds to the clientele
All my fans wanna see me ball
Spent 10K, take a nap at the Taj Mahal

[Outro]
Mahal, Mahal, Mahal
