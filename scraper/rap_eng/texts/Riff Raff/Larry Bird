[Verse 1]
I done flipped my phone, watch what I'm doing
Broke these boys off, three wheels the ancient ruins
A tatted up back, I perm when I'm bored
I done three wheeled and jumped off a diving board
'Sace's keep me cold, slide like M.Bison
Broke these hoes off, concealed a hand gun license
Oil swangin' diploma, got em peepin' my persona
I done shook dice with Larry Bird in Barcelona
Way down in Spain, selling no gimmicks
Broke his hoes off, three wheeled through the Olympics
I done stole the torch, I done bought some starch
I done waved wood on Tiger Woods' golf course
Or Pete Sampras, weed in my damn baby pampers
I done weaved through traffic and disturbed TSU campus
It was a study group, smelling like Joop
I can Ernest Givins electric slide on my roof

[Hook]
The windows are slightly tinted cause they know me
These boys better pay me and these boys don't owe me
The windows are slightly tinted cause they know me
These boys better pay me and these boys don't owe me
The windows are slightly tinted cause they know me
These boys better pay me and these boys don't owe me
The windows are slightly tinted cause they know me
These boys better pay me and these boys don't owe me

[Verse 2]
Jumping out a caravan, eyes like a China man
Bladed up on four Pirellis chopping like a ceiling fan
Holdin' 3 cups in my hand, Styrofoam is China white
Tell the DJ to cut the light I might press a button and blind your sight
Teeth like a king's crown, holding on that four pound
Make them boy's work, they gon' uh, lay it down
Laid it on the ground, paint done got wetter
More fifteens in my trunk than Marcelle's Quinceaneara
Acres Homes Maricon, call me on my cell phone
If you look me in my eye's I might turn your heart to stone
Might pop up in Yellowstone, cause I represent the South Side of the fucking state
But reside in the fucking north side of the fucking city
Did a crime and got acquitted
Every time I open my mouth I got them busta's feeling shitty

[Speaking]
Oh yeah this what that is
Codine fiend dream team
97 Def Jam blaster
Riff Raff. . . Gonna hop on every damn track like its a railroad track
