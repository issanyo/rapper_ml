[Intro: Riff Raff]
You mix the ice
With the thunder
You mix the ice with the youngster, now you got thunder
(Ice)
Ice with the youngster, now you got thunder

[Hook: 2x]
You mix the ice with the youngster, now you got thunder
Got stupid fruity crazy swag, jumping out your dumpster
I'm on that dumb shit, that 7-Series dumb shit
(Is the kid even human, does he even have a thumbprint?)

Jekyllin' her necklace, dinosaur t-rex wrist
Check what's on my next wrist, speechless what you left with
My left wrist'll leave you breathless, empire like red wrist
Sending MySpace messages, giving me new jewelry suggestions
Yeah we could play freeze tag, Hypercolor street Jag
Jostling in my Swedish [?], knock meatballs off the heat rack
My mind is Albert Einstein, yeah I finally turned it up
You have no vocabulary so you need to shut your bitch ass up
You boring, leave me snoring, my song is always
And lyrics so strong I'm'a leave you on the freeway
Your sport is overweight, you never up to date
My bracelet Rice Krispie Treats, my chain is frosted thunder

[Hook]

So they focused on my future, in Miami [?]
My seatbelts is parmesan and yeah my paint is ravioli
And my rims is roly-poly, your defense can hardly hold me
Quit that balling like that Kobe, yeah that's what your mama told me
Like Toaster Strudel, I clutch the toaster, video shoot might rock a holster
Please don't make me lose composure, bank account is Nova Scotia
My brain is expanded, you can't stand it, don't expect you to understand it
So when I say some dumb shit, all that you can say is dammit
This man is so special, educated, partially retarded
Little Caesar's, crazy bread, you can call me Party McHardy
First language piranha, I'm Bobby from Hobby Lobby
You figured I was Garfield, the way I send you to Abu Dhabi

[Hook]
