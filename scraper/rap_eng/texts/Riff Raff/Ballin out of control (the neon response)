[Hook]
Rocks on my hand
Grand Canyon
Big rocks on my hand
Grand canyon
Haters talking down and they can't stand this
My haters talking down can't understand it

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Youngin' had a nice perm
Hair done in Sicily
Used to have a bright wrist
Move like a swordfish
Bored with reality
Half moon galaxy
Cold to a woman touch
Never had to heat me up
Touch me with your best heart
Souls from the octagon
Neon flavored waterfall
Rainforest octopus
Thinkin' 'bout your best friend
Kiss me through the everglades
Man made highway
Laws conspiracy
Trap me with the regulations
Rules form a time warp
Time for a foreign change
Although i still seek the truth
But I'm still in human form
My flesh is a synagogue
Teach me your peaceful ways
War stories strain me
Exit room gracefully
Suckas wana hate me
Librarian wana date me
Love me for your childhood
Used to be my best friend
Choose your next wisely
My chess moves is pessimistic
My life is a kaleidoscope
Take time to love yourself
Violence is the root of evil
Though i talk to no one
Still i wish success on everybody
Never had a carbon copy
I hope you have a beautiful family
And your label is successful financially
