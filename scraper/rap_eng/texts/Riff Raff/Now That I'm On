Intro:
Now That Im On [x3]

Fuck free, do business playin for the fee
Eatin breakfeast at the club, like where's Angela Yee
Dont Envy, life's a piano, try not to damage the keys
You'll vanish with greed, before youve planted the seed
You had decided to gamble like niggas that move to Nevada
And you and your partners maneuver for dollas but who was your partners cuz you wasn't honest when you was in college
You flew to Bahamas like you was Obama but leave it behind you Hakuna Matada
Im blowin like niggas thats cool with Osama (Pause)

Verse [Future]:
Back in the Louis store, back in the Gucci store
Back in my Crystal Louis Vuitton, yeah, where it started ho
Spikes on spikes on spikes, ice on ice on ice
Got bitch on bitch on bitch (where they at)
They foreign and they right
Now that I'm on, 5 different phones
Got 3 different spots, and ain't never home
I change the stone in my watch, i got yo bitch on lock
She in love with Future, she team pluto Hah!

Shoot, drop, next sunday, got em last week

Verse [K Camp]:
Them lame ass niggas still hate, that that shit i dont like
Could spot a snake from a distance, dont need to look in your eyes to know you ain't right
Everyday i wake up in the morning, im just thankful for the day
Take some weed and smoke a blunt, they same im throwed like a bouquet
None of that bullshit dont excite me, boy i had to make a way
Can't help these bitches, love my presence, she gon get unwrapped today
I could tell the way a hater look at me, his face tell me im on
At first that ho ain't get no play, and now she blowin up my phone

Verse [Riff Raff]:
Marcus Vasell, 80 for a see through visor
40 bricks in Michelin Tires, curb and fries, tied buys
Neon violet, auto pilot
Equalizer, fall like spider
Ruby flow, that Aston Martin
Bre-break it down for basic minds
Candy brown, the inside drowned it
Ice cream seats, with cocaine mounts
Forgot to pay the bail bonds, rap game, Barry Bonds
Bobby Bonilla, in the keywee 2 seater
70 million, act like they know me
200 thousand but still they owe me

Outro [Future]:

I came from the bottom, from a place where the cops are the robbers
Its mo money, mo problems
We dont give a fuck, another day another dollar
Now that I'm on
Now that I'm on
