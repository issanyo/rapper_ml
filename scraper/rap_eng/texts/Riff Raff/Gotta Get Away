[HOOK]

Gotta, gotta get away from you
I’ve gotta get away from you
Gotta, gotta get away from you
Gotta get away from you, you, you, you, you…

[VERSE 1: RiFF RAFF]

Split decision – it’s a high-fiver
Work the wood like MacGyver – wrap it up like Al Qaeda
Leave no survivors – rap game Arch Rivals
If you’ve got a baby, I’mma leave your ass like Maria Shriver
It’s a two-sided 50-karat reminder
I pull up on you minors in the candy apple cider
Forest Green on my housing structure
Louis Vuitton on my chain and charm
Parmesan on my neck and arms, wrist's filet mignon

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2: DOLLABiLLGATES]

I might catch a plane – I might switch some lanes
I might Ace of Spade – cut through lobster, eat some steak
I do the crustaceans – tell ‘em stop hatin’
Noxzema paint on the Benz, I put it in they faces
It look like Arnold Schwarzenegger when I valet park it
Give $100 to the valet, tell them they can’t park it
One button start it, one button stop it, these bitches topless
Me and Rap Game got ‘em poppin’, bitch, we on and poppin’
