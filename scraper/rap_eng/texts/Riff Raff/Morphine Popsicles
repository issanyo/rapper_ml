[Verse 1: Andy Milonakis]
Rolling 'round town in my pink Corvette
Sipping on lean with Alanis Morissette
How pimp can it get, how pimp can it get
Motherfucker, how pimp can it get
Skating on bitches with my Razor scooter
Don't got a Glock, but I got a taser shooter
I'm a ruler like that slick dude, cuz
Popping them benzos one by one
My Xanny's so green, greener than a Martian
My granny's so mean, kicked me out of her apartment
That's when I started slinging that raw up
More than a vegan Puerto Rican's class jar
If you fuck with my family, I'll do you like Saw
Did you see Saw, did you see Saw?

[Verse 2: Dirt Nasty]
Dirt Nasty, Raff Reezy, Milonaky
We're here tripping on nightly
Thanks for having us over for the symphony tea, conductor
I ain't tripping on nightly rock laser
Burn rubber by the scrubs at the bus station
Drunk, wasted, sipping on dramamine
Driving on the highway, sleeping, having dreams
Green aliens come in to probe me
Woke up naked, talking to the police
But you know I don't talk to the police
I told them lies--"Hi, I'm Tony"
Now I'm sitting in the jail, wearing all orange
Am I gonna do life, Martin Lawrence
Woke up again, but now I'm in the hospital
Tubes in my dick, got the morphine popsicles

[Verse 3: Riff Raff]
Sapphire face, cradle rock (rock)
Pull up on you snobs in the peach cobbler
Pie, I can make it rain like a Cherokee (Cherokee)
Doing rain dances, will you marry me (marry me)
Some questions never asked twice
Two times sober on a Tuesday night (Tuesday)
Windpipe sound like I'm kin to Prince (Prince)
Rap game Travis Tritt, my diamonds look like Kibbles and Bits (roof)
Pass out milk and candy like a camp counselor (camp counselor)
Pour vodka and codeine on your bouncer (bouncer)
Tortillas, they sound like Reuben Studdards (Reuben)
Hide the 40 cal in the Sam's Club peanut butter
