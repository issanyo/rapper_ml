[Intro]
RiFF!
Used to ride, used to, used to ride a...
Used to, forest, forest green Jag, Jag, Jag
Forest, forest green, work for it
RiFF!

[Chorus]
I used to ride around in the forest green Jag, Jag
I used to ride around, mad, mad
Mad 'cause I had to work for it, work for it, work for it
Mad 'cause I had to work for it, work for it, work for it
I used to ride around in the forest green Jag, green Jag
I used to ride around, mad, mad
Mad 'cause I had to work for it, work for it, work for it
Mad 'cause I had to work for it, had to work for it, work for it

[Verse]
Yeah, shout out to the school books
The same books that I burned in the trash can
Vocabulary, words from Afghanistan
Don't talk to me in public 'cause that ain't my style
A businessman worth a couple hundred million now
A couple hundred billion if we're talkin' 'bout potential
Can't talk about a Lambo if you drive a rental
You can't have a dick if you talk to me, stop talkin'
Better talk to the TV, I'm in HD
Better to talk to my Hummer, it's an H3
All I ever wants an all-girls slumber party
Then I blow up and I act like I don't know nobody
RiFF! Don't, uh uh

[Chorus]
I used to ride around in the forest green Jag, Jag
I used to ride around, mad, mad
Mad 'cause I had to work for it, work for it, work for it
Mad 'cause I had to work for it, work for it, work for it
I used to ride around in the forest green Jag, green Jag
I used to ride around, mad, mad
Mad 'cause I had to work for it, work for it, work for it
Mad 'cause I had to work for it, had to work for it, work for it

[Outro]
RiFF!
