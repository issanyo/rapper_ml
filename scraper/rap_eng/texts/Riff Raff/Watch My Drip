[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Watch my drip, watch my drip, lean
Watch me dip, watch me dip, lean
I'm so geeked, my shoulder lean
Too much drip, she never tease
This push start don't need no keys (Skrt)
Subway, I like melted cheese
Subway, keep it toasted, please
Keep her away, she got steeze
Don't you slip, might break your knee (Ah)
Don't you dip, might break your spleen (Ooh)
Outfit white like Krispy Kream
Watch my drip, watch my drip, lean
Watch me dip, watch me dip, lean
I'm so geeked, my shoulder lean
Too much drip, she never tease
This push start don't need no keys (Skrt)
Subway, I like melted cheese
Subway, keep it toasted, please
Keep her away, she got steeze
Watch my drip, watch my drip, lean
Watch me dip, watch me dip, lean
I'm so geeked, my shoulder lean
Too much drip, she never tease (Riff)
This push start don't need no keys (Skrt)
Subway, I like melted cheese
Subway, keep it toasted, please (Riff)
Keep her away, she got steeze (Uh, yeah)

[Verse: Riff Raff]
Ruin your plans, butter pecan my sedan (Damn), I'm in Japan
Codeine in the door jam (Riff), don't make me freeze the frame
Cocaine in Spain got me changin' my last name
C soft like a Gordita (What), 7th grade with Sosa Garcia
I used to 3 piece wings at Timmy the Chan's (Timmy the Chan)
Sayonara to all of my patnas, my ginger gon' drop 'em
Ginger bread on a helicopter, parallel park outside the doctors office
To be honest, I could have sang in the opera, I chose cocaine and an auto
So many birds, could have played for the falcons (Riff), hundred K piece chain and medallion (Riff)
Made over two million off all of my albums (Riff), five million on flippin' the houses
Living room filled with Versace couches, 'Sace (Riff, Riff)

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Watch my drip, watch my drip, lean
Watch me dip, watch me dip, lean
I'm so geeked, my shoulder lean
Too much drip, she never tease
This push start don't need no keys (Skrt)
Subway, I like melted cheese
Subway, keep it toasted, please
Keep her away, she got steeze
Don't you slip, might break your knee (Ah)
Don't you dip, might break your spleen (Ooh)
Outfit white like Krispy Kream
Watch my drip, watch my drip, lean
Watch me dip, watch me dip, lean
I'm so geeked, my shoulder lean
Too much drip, she never tease
This push start don't need no keys (Skrt)
Subway, I like melted cheese
Subway, keep it toasted, please
Keep her away, she got steeze
Watch my drip, watch my drip, lean
Watch me dip, watch me dip, lean
I'm so geeked, my shoulder lean
Too much drip, she never tease
This push start don't need no keys (Skrt)
Subway, I like melted cheese
Subway, keep it toasted, please
Keep her away, she got steeze
