[Intro]
La musica de Harry Fraud

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
Feel so cold
I came up in the world so cold
Got my heart on froze, my heart on froze
Feel so cold
I came up in the world so cold
Got my heart on froze, got my heart on froze
I, I, I came up in this world so cold, cold, cold

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Yeah, uh, mind incoherent
Taint the days, from the bad experience
I don't hit the line, I pass the interior, e-e-exterior Phantom
Seldom wait for stanza
Bout to hit a couple stories, boy scout lantern, ca-ca-cathedral box
Center stage, like Chris Rock
Recline the top, like Peter Pan drop
Drop a couple smells, top smells, top shelf
Ch-ch-cheddar melt
Fast forward silk chain, made from Tinkerbell
Luxury coated, due to a couple pairs dancing
Marinara sauce on the seat belts, Versace fence
I'm Michael Phelps with the gold medallions, dang
I pulled a couple stallions, my rims rattle, I ball like Ralph Samson
Riff!

[Hook: RiFF RAFF & Curren$y]
Feel so cold
I came up in the world so cold (la-da-da-da)
Got my heart on froze (cold, froze)
My heart on froze (froze, fo'sho)
Feel so cold, I came up in the world so cold
Cold, peep them rings, they're icy, no?
Got my heart on froze, got my heart on froze
Na-na-na, nigga, nigga, uh
I, I, I came up in this world so cold, cold, cold

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Undefeated like my sweats, untouchable rep
Underrated, overhated, fuck 'em, I'm a jet
Life on the set, nigga, live and direct
Like an intercept, halt your progress
I don't celebrate that touchdown yet, you soft as a nightgown
Clown, I see that right now; I'm cold, I'm froze
Like you should have wrapped them pipes; I'm cold, I'm froze
Like put some coats on them children 'fore you let them outside
Getting strong off that green spinach, bitch; Popeye
Pot got me lazy in my long-sleeved tie dye
Whippin' a Mercedes AMG '96 two-door
600 alloy wheels on it, yeah
Introduce me to your best bitch, homie
Eyes can't hide her desire, she on me
Heart on fire for Mr. Frosty, I'm cold, nigga

[Hook: RiFF RAFF & Curren$y]
Feel so cold
I came up in the world so cold (la-da-da-da)
Got my heart on froze (cold, froze)
My heart on froze (froze, fo'sho)
Feel so cold, I came up in the world so cold
Cold, peep them rings, they're icy, no?
Got my heart on froze, got my heart on froze (na-na-na)
