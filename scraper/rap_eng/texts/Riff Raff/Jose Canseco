[Chorus: Fat Pimp]
If you see somebody hating point 'em out
If you see somebody hating point 'em out
If you see somebody hating point 'em out
If you see somebody hating point 'em out
Like oooh there, there them haters go
Like oooh there, there them haters go
Like oooh there, there them haters go
Like oooh there, there them haters go

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Yellows in bikini, tell me how you see me
Sometimes they don't feel you 'till you pull up Lamborghini
I'm sittin' on them thangs, yeah I'm chillin' on them choppers
Part time head turner, full time jaw dropper
Flippin' up my phone, touch screen Motorola
They figured I was bipolar the way I sipped that syrup and soda
Riff on them blades, candy marmalade
I'm trying to pull this dime and her fat ass friend keep gettin' the way
CDs sellin', part time felon
Sometimes they gettin' jealous, chop 'em up like shredded lettuce
I got these haters hot, like global warming
But I swang without warning, get in your ass like that Charmin
Its funny they playin' defense, I'm the only one scoring
You know how it is, back then they didn't want me
Now I'm hot they all boring, they like "Riff Raff just acting black"
He just whilin', oh I get it, you just mad cause I'm stylin' on 'em

[Chorus: Fat Pimp]
If you see somebody hating point 'em out
If you see somebody hating point 'em out
If you see somebody hating point 'em out
If you see somebody hating point 'em out
Like oooh there, there them haters go
Like oooh there, there them haters go
Like oooh there, there them haters go
Like oooh there, there them haters go

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
Shining in the club, riding on dub
Some show love, some mean mug
Some choose to hate, pop tailgate
Recline the fifth, dropped Interstate Skate
Bitch iced out neck, iced out wrist
Hawaiian sunkissed, freestyle scientist
Mixing in the kitchen, I got a new formula
Money stretch like Jackie Joyner without a high school diploma
Moving k-pax, shoes off the rack
Making paper stack, Fat Pimp and Riff Raff
Put 'em in submission, mucho decision
Diamonds in your vision causing head on collision
Yellow on my chest, gotta have finesse
Vaseline saran wrap before birds leave the nest
Know what I'm saying, no I ain't playing
Throw the keys to the man, yup wide valet-ing

[Chorus: Fat Pimp]
If you see somebody hating point 'em out
If you see somebody hating point 'em out
If you see somebody hating point 'em out
If you see somebody hating point 'em out
Like oooh there, there them haters go
Like oooh there, there them haters go
Like oooh there, there them haters go
Like oooh there, there them haters go
