[Intro: Lil Toenail]
Hello?
Bitch, shut the fuck up, I don't want to hear that
Bitch, don't hit my line with that shit
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Lil Toenail]
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (with that fuck shit)
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (with that fuck shit)
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (with that fuck shit)
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (with that fuck shit)
Fuck shit, fuck shit, fuck shit, fuck shit
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (with that fuck shit)
Fuck shit, fuck shit, fuck shit, fuck shit (Ayy, ayy)
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: RiFF RaFF]
Top ten, take your top off with a crowbar
Keeper's, keeper's in my trunk sound like gorillas playing dodge-ball
If your number ain't saved, I just block you, I don't dodge calls
[?] but I might just cop the dodge car
LED headlights, codeine on the [?]
I don't drink and drive, don't FaceTime while you at the party
Wait 'til you get home then show me what you working with (Show me what you)
Twerk a little bit but don't twerk too much
Don't send me videos you already post on Snapchat
Got a movie coming out, bitch, I do not rap
'Leven hour nap and I'm gone off the Actavis
Over now, I'm thinking four leaf clover pronoun
Run five miles at sunset in my ASICS
Hate airports, private planes, even space jets
I hate cars, might move to Mars
Wait in Amsterdam, phone only got two bars

[Chorus: Lil Toenail]

Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (with that fuck shit)
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (with that fuck shit)
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (with that fuck shit)
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (yeah, yeah)
Fuck shit, fuck shit, fuck shit, fuck shit
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (with that fuck shit)
Fuck shit, fuck shit, fuck shit, fuck shit (yeah, ayy, yeah, yeah)
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (yeah, ayy)

[Verse 2: Lil Toenail]
Bitch I lick your booty but I'll never call you back (booty)
Fuck you three times, throw my phone in the trash (gone)
Bitch, I fucked your mom so you better call me "Dad" (Dad)
Don't ever call me if your ass look flat (ew)
If you want a feature, motherfucker, [?] ([?])
If you want a show, bitch, bring me three racks (the money)
If you ain't gone pay then don't ever call me back (don't ever)
If you have my number, leave that shit in the past (bitch)

[Chorus: Lil Toenail]
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (with that fuck shit)
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (with that fuck shit)
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (with that fuck shit)
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (yeah, yeah)
Fuck shit, fuck shit, fuck shit, fuck shit
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (with that fuck shit)
Fuck shit, fuck shit, fuck shit, fuck shit
Please don't hit my line with that fuck shit (yeah)
With that fuck shit
