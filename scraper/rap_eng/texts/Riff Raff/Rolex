[Hook: Riff Raff]
Peep my Rolexes, time is of the essence [x2]
But have you seen my Breitling, the diamonds get exciting
Peep my Rolexes, time is of the essence [x2]
But have you seen my Breitling, the orange diamonds lookin' frightening, yeah

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Hoping thangs get better
I might step out with a chain that might change the weather
I swang forever
I sip drank but on legal level
So much cheese on my sleeve that my arm is cheddar
This arm is wetter
Versace dot with the feather
Senseis from Hong Kong say Riff Raff is a trend-setter
I'mm hard to measure
I drink Armaretto
Even your friendses in your Benzes got secret vendettas
Super model selector
Choppin' block disector
My connects are extra special thirty keys from hector
I'm a rice inspector
And I hate a disrespector
Figured I played for New Jersey Nets the way I rock my Rolex-a

[Hook: Riff Raff]
Peep my Rolexes, time is of the essence [x2]
But have you seen my Breitling, the diamonds get exciting
Peep my Rolexes, time is of the essence [x2]
Have you seen my Breitling, the orange diamonds lookin' frightening, yeah
