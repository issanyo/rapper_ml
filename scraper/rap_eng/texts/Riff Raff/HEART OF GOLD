Too many times
I have been put the test and I failed
Slow is the time
Slow is the time for healing
You can't ever have what you want
At least I can have what I want
Have what I need
You're born all alone
You're born with a heart of gold

Sometimes it's better
Leaves you bitter
Then all alone
If I do your way
I lose part of me
I lose part of me

Too many times
I have been put the test and I failed
Slow is the time
Slow is the time for healing
You can't ever have what you want
At least I can have what I want
Have what I need
You're born all alone
You're born with a heart of gold

Sometimes it's better
Leaves you bitter
Then all alone
If I do your way
I lose part of me
I lose part of me
