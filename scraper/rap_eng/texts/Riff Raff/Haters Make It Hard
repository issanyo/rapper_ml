Uh, haters make it hard, make it-
Uh, haters make it hard, hard
Uh, these haters make it hard

[Hook][x2]
Uh, these haters make it hard to be friends
Haters make it hard to be friends
Haters make it hard, these haters make it hard yall
Haters playing hardball
These haters make it-

[Verse 1]
Uh, check my medallion
Versace salon
James Kony Allen
Then my car insurance Italian
Kobe Bryant jewels, Kobe stake for brunch
I done put codeine in my green Hawaiian punch
I need vacation, kush inhalation
Stash a half a million in my mansion ventilation
Uh, strawberry diamonds like a stoplight
Balling like Mike, sang a hook like Gladys Knight

[Outro]
Haters make it hard
These haters make it hard
Haters make it-
These haters make it hard
