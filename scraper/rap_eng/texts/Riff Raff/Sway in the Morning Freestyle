[Intro]
I ain't trippin', you know, I never be trippin'
On a special occasion, I normally wouldn't do
But since Sway in the building, you know I got you

[Verse 1]
Handshakes hugs
You want me outside, you wanna see me with pancakes and drugs
Take your fat ass to sleep
I'm jumpin' out of the candy-coated grim reaper jeep
I put you to sleep, I put you six feet deep
I'm just on the grind, I blaze a pound, I let my top down
I could've played for Washington Redskins, six points for a touchdown
I might give you a six point diamond, it's a karat, it's apparent
I got more knowledge than both your parents combined
I graduated never, I didn't go to high school in '99
Everything was fine
I bang Ginuwine
No homo, I'm talkin' about in the back of our trunk
That's CD deck, other players wanna check I eat Chex mix
Haters wanna get in the mix
I ball I got a fresh set of kicks
I play for the Phoenix Suns
I graduated in 1991
Damn that motherfucker older than the motherfuckin' moon plus the sun
He got older than the damn solar system
I come through, I might pop trunk on your sister
I eat fried gristle and bacon with eggs and toast
Everybody, "Damn, that motherfucker right there, he ball the most"
He ball from coast to coast, he ball across seven seas
You talkin' 'bout, "Oh, I'm in the game"
Motherfucker you're on your damn knees
Cause you gay
I pull up sittin' sideways with Sway
We at a Chinese buffet eatin' on a Monday, it's a Tuesday
Make it feel like it's damn Ruby Tuesday, it was a Saturday
But it don't even matter anyway
I come through with diamonds and sapphire across my chest
Figured I was kin to Ken Griffey Junior
Come through, I played down south in Oklahoma Sooner
I could've played tailback, halfback, or hatchback, I'm in a four-door hatchback
Damn, motherfucker could've played for the Dallas Mavericks
But they found crack in my jacket
They found marijuana in my socks
These motherfuckers, damn
Mark Cuban said, "Man, you gon' have to box one of these players
Cause they gon' take your position"
Diamonds gon' glisten, wood wheels twistin'
Sign on the back, let's just go fishin'
Let's go to sleep
