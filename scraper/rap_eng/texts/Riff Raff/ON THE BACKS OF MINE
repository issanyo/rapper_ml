Hook:
On the backs of mine there are nations
On the backs of mine there is life
On the backs of mine there are spaceships
On the backs of mine there is flight
We'll go to the moon
On the backs of mine
We'll go to the stars
On the backs of mine
A whole 'nother galaxy
On the backs of mine
We're raising the bar
On the backs of mine
We going up
On the backs of mine
We blowing up
On the backs of mine
We going up
On the backs of mine
We blowing up
On the backs of mine

Verse 1:
On the backs of mine
You got cities
On the backs of mine
You got food
On the backs of mine
You got vision
On the backs of mine
On the backs of mine

On the backs of mine

On the backs of mine
We got loans
On the backs of mine
We got burned
On the backs of mine
On the backs of mine

Verse 2:
On the backs of mine
I got Jackson 5
I got "Flashing Lights"
And I'm laughing like
The hooded klan ain't trying to
Put me in afterlife
Like I'm passing by
With no traffic lights
There is sacrifice
There were battered thighs
There were tattered ties
There were fatter eyes
That need bags of ice
In the backs of rides
But that Jackson 5
Give a relaxing vibe
So my dance is high
With a passion vibe
I advance in spite
Of the chance I'll die
And if the facts survive
And they don't sanitize
What actually happened I
Might see a chance for flight

Verse 3:
On the backs of mine
We got blood
On the backs of mine
We got sweat
On the backs of mine
We got tears
On the backs of mine
On the backs of mine

On the backs of mine
You got trains
On the backs of mine
You got roads
On the backs of mine
You got house
On the backs of mine
On the backs of mine

Verse 4:
On the backs of mine
You got ample time
To advance and rise
While I sank and died
Got to recognize
The effects if I
Want to rectify
Or want to reconcile

Verse 5:
On the backs of mine
We got free
On the backs of mine
We got spirit
On the backs of mine
We got God
On the backs of mine
On the backs of mine

On the backs of mine
We got peace
On the backs of mine
We got fire
On the backs of mine
We got jazz
On the backs of mine
On the backs of mine

On the backs of mine
We got style
On the backs of mine
We got moves
On the backs of mine
We got books
On the backs of mine
On the backs of mine

On the backs of mine
We got schools
On the backs of mine
We got business
On the backs of mine
We got churches
On the backs of mine
On the backs of mine

On the backs of mine
We got shops
On the backs of mine
We got fields
On the backs of mine
We got prayers
On the backs of mine
On the backs of mine

On the backs of mine
You got lost
On the backs of mine
You got cost
On the backs of mine
You got glory
On the backs of mine
On the backs of mine

Verse 6:
On the backs of mine
We got to maximize
On the passing time
With an appetite
For the rapid rise
We can actualize
What was advertised
In the land of lies
There are bands of spies
Who will stand for rights
Through the sands of time
We going to amplify
An imagined life
Where enchanted light
Is a standard sight
In a family vibe
