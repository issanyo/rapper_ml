[Hook X2]
I hope my car dont break down
I hope I get paid today
Get drunk, go to sleep, wake back up
Do the same thing, that I did yesterday
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Yea, and I never was a nice kid
Dropped out of school 10th grade, dont let yah kids hear this
Bully pitchers run they mouth, talking reckless
My mind designed cool cups, icey necklace
Your dad see me tell your son get like me
Your momma talking down those 23's on gmc
I dont like too many humans, rap game ferris bueller
I coulda played for arkansas, okolahoma sooners
[Verse]

[Hook X2]
I hope my car dont break down
I hope I get paid today
Get drunk, go to sleep, wake back up
Do the same thing, that I did yesterday
[Hook]
