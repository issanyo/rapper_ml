Chorus:
3 4 more kickers
And my night is filled with liquid lava
I'm stretch 5 hundred Got you thinking
Extra commas'
My hole dam life I'm popping yams breathing
Straight tundra'
I keep my glacier by my lungs
And my life is like thunda'
I got it twisted 4 am
It still ain't looking pretty
I got your sister snorting coke
Off my new bitches titties
This life I live is full of cash advances neon waves
Rap game cassius clay (full full)
Full moon razor blade

(Hook x 8)
Why you still tight I keep my pockets
Filled with ace of spades

We wake up 9 am, shooting jumpers, skiing mountains
Brain looking cloudy, flipping Lexus, majestic necklace
We rocking jewels from Australia, gold flexin'
I'm walking like a pirate ship wreck, treasure chest
Four hundred vicious strippers popping pills, sipping liquor
I might as well grab some ass fuck, grab some bitches
Looking like I got the team on my back
Rap game kemosabe,in a papaya maserati

(hook x 8)
Why you still tight I keep my pockets
Filled with ace of spades

Outro:
(I I I I I) put my team back doe
My whole team on my back
My my team on my back doe
1 hundred pounds of rice coming through the back doe
Come come come coming though the back doe'
1 hundred pounds of rice coming thought the back (doe doe)
I put my team on my back doe
1 hundred pounds of rice coming through the back doe
Coming through the back doe
Coming through the back doe

My team on my back doe
I put my team on my back doe
I put my team on my back doe
