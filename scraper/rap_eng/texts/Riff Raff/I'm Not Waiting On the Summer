I got my coke and I got my gin
I take my coat off and I tell the bartender to fill me up to the brim
I had a pretty rough November
I lost my Dad, he used to call me and say "Son have you made it yet?"

So I'm not waiting on the summer
I'm not waiting for somebody else to tell me how to live my life
I'm not waiting on the summer
I'm not waiting on somebody else to tell me how to live my life

I can still hear my mother cry
Telling me to pack my bag
And get the hell out of her life
She must have had a pretty good reason
Cuz I don't have many friends
And I don't remember where I stayed that evening

But I'm not waiting on the summer
I'm not waiting for somebody else to tell me how to live my life
I'm not waiting on the summer
I'm not waiting for somebody else to tell me how to live my life

Women come and the women go
I met this girl, we were headed to somewhere in Mexico
She could never stay too long
She always had a flight to catch
And I was always doing something wrong

But I'm not waiting on the summer
I'm not waiting on somebody else to tell me how to live my life
I'm not waiting on the summer
I'm not waiting on somebody else to tell me how to live my life

Women go...
Met this girl...
We was headed to somewhere in Mexico
I'm not waiting on the summer
I'm not waiting on somebody else to tell my how to live my life
