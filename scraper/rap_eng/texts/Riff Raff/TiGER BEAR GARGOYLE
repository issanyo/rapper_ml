[Intro] (x2)
Can I get a price scan on you?...yeah

[Hook] (x2)
Now I'm on your roof, gargoyle (grrr)
Now I'm on your roof, gargoyle (grrr)
Now I'm on your roof, gargoyle
She came in the club lookin' like a tiger bear

[Verse]
Yeah, uhhh
If looks could kill, homicide
Let me know 'bout the extra baggage, drama side
Know you had your heart broke about a thousand times
Maybe this'll cheer you up, rollercoaster ride
Palace stage park, your body work of art
Now we're in colonial times, stagecoach ride after dark
Take your shoes off, get comfortable
You could let your hair down...Rapunzel
