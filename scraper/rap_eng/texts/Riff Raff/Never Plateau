Never plateau

When you see the horizon
Near expand your options

Faint traces of marmalade
Scents dangle in the
Southern wind and leave
An Erie iridescent indigo
Light glowing on a not so
Well beaten path

The calming wind as wheat
Thistles as the navy storm

Clouds shutter past the
Werewolf alluring full
Moon as i stare into the sky
Waiting for a witch to pass
The mello illumination
Of the night

I wait for them to take me
Somewhere... Anywhere..
Above & Beyond
The earth's surface

The more humans that are
Forcefully bred upon this
Planet the less humanity is
Shed upon each other's soul

We have been bombarded
With an imaginary
Competition that is
Impossible to win

The sun is a ball of
Tangerine light in
The horizon

Chase that and
Chase your dreams

Never Plateau
