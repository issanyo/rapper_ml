[Intro]
Rain on the sunroof yeah
Rain on the sunroof yeah
Rain on the sunroof yeah
Rain on the sunroof yeah
Gold gold chain swinging
Wants her butt bigger
I told her stop fucking with them fuck niggas

[Verse 1 - Riff Raff]
I outlined the lecture
With the crocodile texture
If you intellectual
Never disrespectful
Nice Versace knifers
Hold it down like staples
Watch how I
Stack the paper pull a purple maple
So turn the tables
I deserve to be grateful
I pull up at Notredame in the candy grapefruit
Isake, number 9
Shade by Geneful
When I roll up through __
With the golden handlebars
The suit is aqua
But the shoes is tiger-grip
Jump off the ship
With the Bruce Lee wing tips
Notice the wind
I know the rise the Benz
On corners
With all winds gotta hang on the rim
RIFF!

[Hook]
Gold gold chain swinging
Wants her butt bigger
I told her stop fucking with them fuck niggas
Gold gold chain swinging
Wants her butt bigger
I told her stop fucking with them fuck niggas

[Verse 2 - After the Smoke]
Bitches go round, niggas getting slammed
Plates on plates, grams on grams
That's another case you can thank Uncle Sam
What what makes that money talk
What what what makes them hoes dance
Gold chain swinging, wants her butt bigger
I told her stop fucking with them fuck niggas
Fucked off, for a Mitsubishi
Puffing on that seaweed, apartment in Tahiti
I want them nasty bitches, who hula hoop my peepee
All night repeat, poke up out a TV
Be my main feature, fuck her then ideally
She sipping on that slushie
The whisky makes her slutty
Ja don't get it twisted
Her faith is in the money
Funny ha
Her faith is in the money

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 - Logic Ali]
I'm pushing everything like its meta-yang
Address my levels bitch like I'm Eddie James
I'm bout my cheddar man I'm tryna cop a plane
A couple buildings bitches thinking I'm insane
I'm smoking marijuana that'll paralyse you
And bitch I'm higher than a paraglider
I'm shooting dice like I'm all in
Flocking New York after Houston like I'm Jade Lynn
All day day bitches, tryna, play friends
Knowing if I wanted ho, I could pay your rent
And I ain't really tripping cuz it's ten per shawty
All your bitches and your sisters know me, homie
LOG I see I liz up, on these speakers
Trapzillas trap keep her everybody need one
I'm ballin
I should've played for Tahiti
And rhymes I spit graffiti
Bitch

[Hook x2]
