[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Give me 5 minutes I can still fuck your bitch, Swag
Young Based God, got hoes on my dick
In my second home getting a god bitch
Go around town, get money fuck bitch
Everybody ask me: Will I get married?
When the sky turns red and hoes try to scare me
Bitches on my dick cause I look like a fairy
No homo, bitch, I got the Rice with the Jerry
Niggas want to rob me, Bruh, got the chopper
Lay his ass down, leave him red like a lobster
Lay his ho down I'm a fuck her so proper
In Montreal and I got a bad bopper
Bitch I speak French; Vevu fway suck my dick
Go around town, tell them that I’m finer than my bitch
Niggas try to play me, man you know I go the AK
I’m a lesbian, i got bitches like everyday

[Chorus]
I'm a take your shorty
I'm a take your shorty
I'm a take your shorty
She always wanna call me
I'm a take your shorty
I'm a take your shorty
I'm a take your shorty
She Just want to party

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
Break em’ off like breaking wrists, lights on probation
Forty karrot chopper and I'm walking blind [?]
On my Gucci blindfold, I'm a smell like 9 zones
Talking on my iPhone, smelling like a pine cone
I'm a smell like Christmas, Stacy on my wish list
Marcus Jacobs [?] [?]
Markets by the wrist list
This is going to be hit list
Throw them like a discus
I’m at dinner table and I’m who you discuss
And they gon’ distrust, maybe misuse em’
Knighted states shoes with the Babe Ruth abusive
All that rep of Saber tooth, fifteen karrot [?] one
Now I look like Sharron Stone
On my Basic Instinct
I’m on everything Pink
Everything in mint sink
I'm a ball until you shrink
Pockets looking like they think
Pockets look like Brains
And I got super station
Send them to the train station
Pockets on ovation

[Chorus]
I'm a take your shorty
I'm a take your shorty
I'm a take your shorty
She always wanna call me
I'm a take your shorty
I'm a take your shorty
I'm a take your shorty
She Just want to party
