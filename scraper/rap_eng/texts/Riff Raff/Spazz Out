[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
They used to sell me dreams, my [?] in the back
I'm looking for my team but my team is in the back
Spazzin' out, spazz out whoa
I didn't  finish school, school is not for me
She's only 19 but her ID says she's 23
She's spazzin' out, spazz out whoa
Spazz out, spazz out
Spazz out, spazz out

[Bridge: RiFF RAFF]
We spazz out, we spazz out
We spazz out, we spazz out
We spazz out, we spazz out
They used to sell me dreams, my [?] in the back
They used to sell me dreams, my [?] in the back
Spazzin' out whoa we spazz out
I didn't  finish school, school is not for me
I didn't  finish school, school is not for me
Spazzin' out whoa we spazz out
Spazz out

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
We pulled up late but I was already drunk
Two pints of whisky in my red Hawaiian Punch
[?] love to hate me but I don't give a fuck
Drinking Budweisers in the back of Stacey's truck
Ya I smoked out for breakfast waking up at lunch
I'm the young sun hotter than a dragon tongue
Leaning at the light I can't see straight
Lady Luck's in my favor, glow in the dark razors

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
They used to sell me dreams, my [?] in the back
I'm looking for my team but my team is in the back
Spazzin' out, spazz out whoa
I didn't  finish school, school is not for me
She's only 19 but her ID says she's 23
She's spazzin' out, spazz out whoa
Spazz out, spazz out
