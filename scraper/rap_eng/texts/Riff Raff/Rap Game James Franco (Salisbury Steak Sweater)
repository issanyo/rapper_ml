[Hook: Riff Raff]
Non-stop through desert, Salisbury steak sweater
They figured I was kin to Chester, the way I chase cheddar
Non-stop through desert, Salisbury steak sweater
They figured I was kin to Chester, the way I chase cheddar

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
First out the gate, windows gon' break
License on plate, deatachable tailgate
Substance abuse, [?] the rules, though
Don't get confused, born to rock jewels
Body by Jake, never was told
Skin of sand, soul of gold
Sleep out the [?], millions were sold
Watch me flip Water, like a surfboard
Name was Heather, 'sace on feather
Non-stop through desert, Salisbury steak sweater
They figured I was kin to Chester, the way I chase cheddar

[Verse 2: Deezuz]
Yeah I'm a game changer, lane changer
Make it rain in the elevator, don't care, rock the alligator
Over there, pockets hella papered (yeah), Chase bankrolls
All over town, thankful, price right, life's like
Living up with the angels, so fly, so high, bowtie
Rapped on her neck, throw cash, blow it fast, puff pass, purple grass, yup
Spend a whole check on a Rolex, I don't give a fuck
I'mma go next, I don't do lines, I don't wait around, y'all are too high
Where the bills at, got the Bills hat
Louis V duffel, I'mma fill that
Back with Riff Raff, we just killed that (killed that, killed that, killed that)
