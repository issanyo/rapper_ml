I am not that rude
Lemon lime on the Bentley Coup
[?] substitute

[Verse 2: Young Hu$tle]
I ain't tryna change, hammers quick to bang
Rolls gold the chain, hoes know the name
SoCo the gang
[?] Master T catastrophe
I ain't tryna change
Just stacking up this change
Badder bitches at the crib
Still get kicked out the same
Got some money on the fly
[?] on the fly
Don't beef with the kid
You ain't tryna risk your life
Better think about your goals
All that balling and your flows
See the real hustlers know
You just ear hustling bro
New chain embrace the Rolex
[?] dodge the case
Watch and pay
Custom jewels, that's the rules
Tats and tools, I'm a fool
But you know that
Trap life just a [?]
Take your bitch, put it down on the whole track
Things change since it [?] crack boy

[Hook: RiFF RaFF]

I ain't tryna change, I'm just tryna stack change
I want a motherfucking chain, I want a motherfucking chain
I ain't tryna change, I'm just tryna stack change
I want a motherfucking chain, I want a motherfucking chain
I ain't tryna change, I'm just tryna stack change
I want a motherfucking chain, I want a motherfucking chain
