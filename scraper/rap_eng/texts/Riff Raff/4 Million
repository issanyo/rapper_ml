[Intro]
Leanin' on, leanin' on
Leanin' on
Leanin', leanin', leanin' on
Leanin' on, leanin' on
Leanin' on, leanin' on
Leanin' on

[Hook]
Leanin' on leather, seats back on recline
Leanin' on leather, seats back on recline
Leanin' on leather, leanin' on leather
Leanin' on leather, seats back on recline
I only made 4 million last year
I only made 4 million last year
Leanin' on leather, seats back on recline
Leanin' on leather, seats back on recline

[Verse 1]
Sixteen ounces, two times eight
Purple estate, grape drapes
Leanin' on leather, seats back on recline
I can lemon lime, tangerine sun shine
Reflects off my diamonds
Riff Raff been gridin'
Since 1927, I done swung through 7/11
Cause Versace earthquake
Me and dollar Bill Gates
Done scrape plates done bell weigh eight
They call me Richie Riff

[Hook]
Leanin' on leather, seats back on recline
Leanin' on leather, seats back on recline
Leanin' on leather, leanin' on leather
Leanin' on leather, seats back on recline
I only made 4 million last year
I only made 4 million last year
Leanin' on leather, seats back on recline
Leanin' on leather, seats back on recline

[Verse 2]
Fendi on my lunch, I can Ben Braun
Relaxin' codeine castle eating filet mignon
It's Eleanor Roosevelt in a golden cell
I don't never ask for help
Shot more jumps than Tony Delk
I shot more jumpers than Mark Price
I'm shaking the dice, I'm sevens twice
I'm slurping slice
My chain looks like, I just committed a diamond heist
The fuck you want, the fuck you need
I bob and weave with tricks up sleeve
I vanish into the night like Harry Houdini, on a Versace jet ski

[Hook]
Leanin' on leather, seats back on recline
Leanin' on leather, seats back on recline
Leanin' on leather, leanin' on leather
Leanin' on leather, seats back on recline
I only made 4 million last year
I only made 4 million last year
Leanin' on leather, seats back on recline
Leanin' on leather, seats back on recline
