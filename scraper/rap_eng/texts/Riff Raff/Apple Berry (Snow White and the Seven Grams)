[Intro]
Yo what up juve' baby
What's happenin' baby
MIA dirty play
H-Town connect
What's been goin' down up there

[Chorus]
(Gat in my bed, weed on my pillow)
Ain't the one blame
When you see me in the streets
Don't call me on my name (don't call me on my name)
(Gat in my bed, weed on my pillow)
Represent your city, represent your city
Do a crime get acquitted (don't call me on my name)
(Gat in my bed, weed on my pillow)
Beat up your block, beat up your block
And make it screwed up and chopped (don't call me on my name)
(Gat in my bed, weed on my pillow)
Show your gold grill, make these boys chill
With the diamonds in your grill (don't call me on my name)

[Verse 1]
Body rock, I might lead a lot
I can chop a block like a rock
Boy til' I'm hot, or til' it's cold
Watch my fifth fold
Appleberry over gold
Still 22, like the Clyde Drexler
Or I can put a 9 to your chest like Van Exel
Like the Pistol Pete, I can hold heat
44 shoot the jays off your feet
Leanin' on the scene boy
Since the byzantine
I been touching so much cash my hands permanently green
First finger tip, put it to your lips
It's a raff riff rap game Merrill Lynch
No mo' transactions, no mo' money to be made
Make you lose weight rap game Jenny Craig
Make you back flip, extra clip, hollow tips
Like Billy The Kid, two 9's by my hip

[Chorus]
(Gat in my bed, weed on my pillow)
Ain't the one blame
When you see me in the streets
Don't call me on my name (don't call me on my name)
(Gat in my bed, weed on my pillow)
Represent your city, represent your city
Do a crime get acquitted (don't call me on my name)
(Gat in my bed, weed on my pillow)
Beat up your block, beat up your block
And make it screwed up and chopped (don't call me on my name)
(Gat in my bed, weed on my pillow)
Show your gold grill, make these boys chill
With the diamonds in your grill (don't call me on my name)

[Verse 2]
At the red light, rims don't stop
Beat up your block and make the neighbours call the cops
Show my gold grill, pockets lookin' funny
Ain't got no more hunnids , TV Johnny got all my money
Down in H-Town, piece up on my chest
Triangle on my ass man I'm talkin' bout Guess
Scorched down, 20 piece gold crown
It's the Riff Raff I make your wife and kids frown
Make 'em mad, paper tag on my Jag'
All this ice on my chain got frost on my abs
Pay the cost, pay the cost to ride gloss
I can take my grill out and buy a two story house
At the kappa, we done poured up a Snapple
Hit a air shock and damn near broke the adapter
Candy applejack, yup that's the paint
I done showcase my grill and made the whole club faint

[Chorus]
(Gat in my bed, weed on my pillow)
Ain't the one blame
When you see me in the streets
Don't call me on my name (don't call me on my name)
(Gat in my bed, weed on my pillow)
Represent your city, represent your city
Do a crime get acquitted (don't call me on my name)
(Gat in my bed, weed on my pillow)
Beat up your block, beat up your block
And make it screwed up and chopped (don't call me on my name)
(Gat in my bed, weed on my pillow)
Show your gold grill, make these boys chill
With the diamonds in your grill (don't call me on my name)
