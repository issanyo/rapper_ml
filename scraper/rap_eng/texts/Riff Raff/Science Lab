[Intro: Riff Raff]
Yeeeah
Freestyle Scientist in this motherfucker
Go ahead and... cook up a new formula on them boys

That's how I feel, that's what it was
Fire red dragon on a stretch pearl rug
No time to snooze, no time to lose
Bad yellow bitch by my feet changing my shoes
And my shoelaces, Burberry braces
Cut off the lights, look like Las Vegas
Look like a city, bitch I look like a star
I done fingered a ho with a Coogi cigar
I be wylin', I be smilin'
I done bought a bird and flew back to Rhode Island
I-4-5in, crawlin like a spider
Catch me in the cut building shit like McGyver
Give me a screwdriver, I can start a Jag
I done started a Lamborghini with a police badge
No need to light me, I'm already lit
Run your ass over like I'm kin to Emmitt Smith
Kin to Michael Irvin, grape '88
Neon green bracelet like a snake up in my face
Always been a Swisher, never been a bricker
Tighten up my game like a boa constrictor
Like a python, on my right arm
Bad yellow bitch I done style from Akon
Oh by the way, I'm hotter than a fever
I'm rockin so much ice I got mistaken for a freezer
I'm thinking felony, no more misdemeanor
I stay in so much beef you figured I was a meat cleaver
50k a show, 90 out in Spain
40 carats on my hand froze my woodgrain

[Bridge: Riff Raff]
Hold up man
It's the Freestyle Scientist
Yeah
It's the Freestyle Scientist
Now marinate, now marinate
Now feel that, now f...

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
Yokahama pedal, sometimes three-wheelin
I'm finna start breaking shit like a stressed out gorilla
Like Elvis Presley, Crunch like the Nestle
You skating on thin ice like that boy Wayne Gretzky
Slap a bitch on purpose, and didn't say sorry
But I can play Atari through a African safari
I could pass the mic, but why bother?
Like that boy Maury said, "you are the baby's father."

[Outro: Riff Raff]
Hold up, man
It's the Freestyle Scientist
Yeah
It's the Freestyle Scientist
If I drop my album
Boys might end up in ICU
Cause ICU, naw you see me, yeah
It's the Freestyle Scientist
It's the Freestyle Scientist
