[Hook]

[X2]
I done poured codeine on my white silk pants
I done poured codeine on my white silk pants
Sucker ass rappers and they never had a chance

Sucker ass rappers and they never had a chance
I done poured codeine on my white silk pants
I done poured codeine on my white silk pants
Sucker ass rappers and they never had a chance

[Verse 1]
Look like shoot, jumpers like Kobe
Now I'm on blades and I'm chopping like Shinobi
Act like they know me, ball like Gin√≥bili
Las Vegas can't fold me, rap game Axel Foley
I can make moves like I'm kin to Bobby Fischer
Walking through your house, and I'm blowing on a Swisher
Switch up the game like I'm Ken Griffey Jr
Drop movie in November but it might be coming sooner
Souped up the Cobra now I'm forty-five status
Like to stack cabbage while I'm flipping candy cactus
Never need practice, ball across the atlas
I can gain nutrition eating Versace water salads

[Hook x2]
