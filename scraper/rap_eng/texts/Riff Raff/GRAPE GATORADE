Power up! Now I'm rollin'
My fifth chipped but the swangers not stolen!
Ball like I'm bowlin
Like a scientist
I done po'ed a 5th in a peach sunkist
Now it's going down in the dirty dirty tre
I popped my trunk on MLK
Where I stay, I been choppin on them blades!
Fendi keep me shaded, cadillac escalade
Back in nine eight I done pulled a caper
I done washed paper with that boy Tony Draper
I done po'ed a 8 in a grape gatorade
Sipped to much drank til I fell off the stage
I ruined my performance but I was starched in Ralph Lauren
Flippin in my.....but I was flippin in my foreign
Riff Raff in the south so the money in the house
Blindin all you boys cuz them diamonds in my mouth! (Jeuh!)
