[Intro: Mike Posner]
Maybe you love me, maybe you don't
Don't try to play me, I'm the same as before

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Uhh, yea
Ain't it my agenda? (agenda) I'm a corner bender (bender)
Big money spender, never been a money lender (lender)
You could be my friend or you could be my enemy
Two choices in front of you, it really don't offend me (offend me)
If I'm a free man (man), don't apprehend me (yep)
Don't contradict me, situation could get sticky (sticky)
Rap game Lebron James, first round pick me (pick me)
Now we in the back of my Bentley, she want to tickle me
On her neck was a hickey, had to take a second glance
She looking damn good in her spandex pants (that ass)
My skills bending hands, no more shaking hands
You got to bring some bad bitches if you want a second chance
Riff

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Maybe you love me, maybe you don't
Don't try to play me, I'm the same as before
People talk about the new me, say what you want
Maybe you love me, maybe you don't (Maybe you don't)

[Bridge x2: Mike Posner & (RiFF RAFF)]
If you don't want to love me, you don't got to love me no more
(And we can restart)

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
(Riff) Night looking young, but I'm looking yonder (yonder)
Hot like five saunas, my shoelaces is iguana (iguana)
Trump towers with Donald (Donald) I can't drive a Honda (uh uh)
Now I got options, you can hate me if you wanna
You used to be so pretty (pretty) I kiss you on the titty (titty)
Take trips to Mississippi because your attitude is shitty (damn)
Now you got a choice, listen to my voice (voice)
Make your legs moist when I push a Rolls Royce (vroom)
Push button start (start) I fill a carport
You should practice martial arts, the way you karate chop my heart
I could leave your ass or you could play your part (part)
You could reset or we could restart

[Hook + Bridge x2]

[Mike Posner]
No auto tune was used in the making of this recording

[RiFF RAFF]
And we can restart, and we can restart - Riff!
