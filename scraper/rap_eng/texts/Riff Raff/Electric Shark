[Verse: Riff Raff]

Yeah bitch
The game's been good
And all these hoes want sit on the leather and the wood
I done rode through Rome on 80 inches of chrome
But I done condone the way I live my life
Like a young Al Capone, leave me alone
Play with my piece, I'll leave you deceased
I touch down in your city
The crime rate increase
You ain't gotta be in the streets
I'm the king of the sheets
Versace
Bathtub and jacuzzi by Fendi
Pocket full of enemies
I guess that's what I get for being friendly
Plus, plus, plus
A stolen credit card and deduction of budget
You ain't gotta be in my face in public
You steal my album out your wife's hall
Rub it and dub it
They ain't gotta play me in your city
I'm in full rotation in
Jamaica and Dublin
There ain't no substitution
For the hoes I'm recruiting
I walk inside the club with the baddest bitch
At the flick of a wrist
She sing in a high pitch
My favorite rappers
J Dawg and Big Pic
Plus Adrian Greene
Let's keep it Kosher
You ain't gotta lose your composure
Cause you see my face on a poster (why?)
On your sister's wall
Threw a New Year's Eve Ball
At Taj Mahal
No parents
I was raised by Chamillionare and Paul Wall
Pimp C is my uncle
I'm capable of making knees buckle
When I did an Iverson crossover
All the way in Kentucky
The way I mix and mingle leave you bilingual and bingle
The DJ don't wanna play my new single it's cool
I'm crawling down his chimney on December 25th
Like Kris Kringle mother fucker

[Bridge: MGMT]

All along the western front
People line up to receive
She got the power in her hands
To shock you like you won't believe
Saw her in the Amazon
With the voltage running skin
Standing there with nothing on
She gonna teach me how to swim

[Chorus: MGMT] x2

Oh girl
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel
