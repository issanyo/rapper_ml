[Intro: Justin Hibbert [i]]
B b b beat it
I beat it up
Beat it up
I beat it up

[Verse 1: Justin Hibbert [i]]
I'm that coke and rum
She that sprite and vodka
In the street with some blanca
That i purchased from a rasta
You say you start
But you ain't on the roster
Watched the history channel
And now you think you martyrs
She got it moving
Like it's her revolution
And she just had a revelation
That she may be dancing with Satan
Fallen angels at the VIP table
Cradle To The Grave
She calls me baby
So it's grave to the cradle
Uh
And i popped some DMX
Now my jaws rough riding
If your friends say you hot they lying
Uh yeah
The lying
I was born
They were dying
Boy you don't know yourself
Go and find him
While i play hide and seek with your chick
Unlike you, she finds it

[Chorus: Female]
And he beat it up like
Bang, Bang
And then i give it back like
Bang, Bang
And he beat it up like
Bang, Bang
Tell them what you do to this damn thing
[Justin Hibbert [i]]
Beat it up
I beat it up
Beat it up
I beat it up
[Female]
And he beat it up like
Bang, Bang
And then i give it back like
Bang, Bang
And he beat it up like
Bang, Bang
Tell them what you do to this damn thing
[Justin Hibbert [i]]
Beat it up
I beat it up
Beat it up
I beat it up

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
Uh
Jump out the
Grey Lexus (Thunderstorm)
Uh
Plates disposable
I approach the Benz
And the doors go up
Heat sensors (Electronic)
I pull up
In the new millennium
Thinking it was september
Ice colder than a blender
Left outside of east Brazil
I finessed the wood wheel
I caressed it so many times
It thought, It had feelings
It had to go see a psychiatrist
I pull up
Doors look like therapist
Check my left wrist
Better yet
Camouflage diamonds
Better yet
Perfect timing
Drop the top down even when the sun's not shining

[Chorus: Female]
And he beat it up like
Bang, Bang
And then i give it back like
Bang, Bang
And he beat it up like
Bang, Bang
Tell them what you do to this damn thing
[Justin Hibbert [i]]
Beat it up
I beat it up
Beat it up
I beat it up
[Female]
And he beat it up like
Bang, Bang
And then i give it back like
Bang, Bang
And he beat it up like
Bang, Bang
Tell them what you do to this damn thing
[Justin Hibbert [i]]
I beat it, I beat it, I beat it, I beat it, I beat it up) [Overlay]
Beat it up
I beat it up
Beat it up
I beat it up
