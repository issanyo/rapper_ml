[Versace Python Freestyle: Riff Raff]

[Hook: riff raff]

As the days keep turnin'
As the world keeps burnin'
As my soul keeps learnin'
Tears fall from from the castles around my heart

[Verse 1: riff raff]

Paper boy, Chuck Norris
Now I'm in china town, bok choy
Shoulda' took a pill, clamicil

I coulda' played for vanderbilt
Jody, Jody Hightower, Highwater
Jody jody, jody jody Highroller
I sip the syrup in my soda

Take it out

[Hook: riff raff]
