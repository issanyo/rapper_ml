Hook:
We at the funk club with the vibrate
We at the funk club with the vibrate
We at the funk club with the vibrate
We at the funk club with the vibrate
We at the funk club with the vibrate
We at the funk club with the vibrate
We at the funk club with the vibrate
We, we

Verse 1 - Riff Raff:
Alright come on, start from the top
Jack in the box, crack in the pot
Blueberry knots, Periwinkle blocks
Frost on my nose, wrist rose gold
Toast to my soul, Drape me in gold
Diamond the same size as the Super Bowl
Tipsy fruit, fruit loop juice
Big face honeycomb,
I should be starring in Tombstone 2.
Cold and hatchet in a Honda hatchback,
Riff, Riff, Riff, Riff

Verse 2 - Ranna Royce:
Hazy. Blazey. Bubbly. Dazey

Chip:
This dumb ass

Hook:
We at the funk club with the vibrate
We at the funk club with the vibrate
We at the funk club with the vibrate
We, we, we
We at the funk club with the vibrate
We at the funk club with the vibrate
We at the funk club with the vibrate
We, we, we

Riff Raff:
Ay, I wanna uh
Alright come on,
Ay, ay, ay

Ranna Royce:
Hazy. Blazey. Bubbly. Dazey

Chip:
This dumb ass

Hook:
We at the funk club with the vibrate
We at the funk club with the vibrate
We at the funk club with the vibrate
We, we, we

Riff Raff:
Jack in the box, box, box, box, box
