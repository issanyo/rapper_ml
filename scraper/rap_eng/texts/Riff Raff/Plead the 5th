[Pre-Chorus: Pressa]
I said, "damn"
I just want the ice on my wrist
I just want those [?]

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
(Damn!)
I just iced out my wrist
(Damn!)
I just balled in the mix
(Damn!)
They asking too many questions, plead the 5th
(Damn!)
I just poured a six in my Sunkist
(Damn!)
I just iced out my wrist
(Damn!)
I just balled in the mix
(Damn!)
They asking us too many questions, plead the 5th
(Damn!)
I just poured a six in my Sunkist
(Damn!)

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
I just copped a mansion
All my diamonds dancing
Like a jack-o-lantern
Young Mike Myres
Turning heads like a pliers
Plus he got dogs from Philadelphia, because I stay flyer
Damn, I just copped a new Sedan
Damn, I just iced out my hand
Damn, I just pull up islands
Oh, you got a boyfriend?
Watch me switch up my plans
I slick move hands
Watch my roof subtract
Watch my mood subtract
Got my fifth relaxed
Damn, my trunk just took a nap now
Riff Raff and Pressa
Cost at least 20 racks uhn

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
(Damn!)
I just iced out my wrist
(Damn!)
I just balled in the mix
(Damn!)
They asking too many questions, plead the 5th
(Damn!)
I just poured a six in my Sunkist
(Damn!)
I just iced out my wrist
(Damn!)
I just balled in the mix
(Damn!)
They asking too many questions, plead the 5th
(Damn!)
I just poured a six in my Sunkist

[Post-Chorus: Pressa]
Damn, I just want to ice out my wrist (Ooh, damn)
I just want them bitches on my dick (God damn)
If you got a man, I'll be your man
I just want these bands on my neck

[Verse 2]
Baby said that she can get it
Hungry, grinding, and I need it
Ass fat, she gon' sell it
Kill the bitch if she gon' tell it
Cause trap boy, I can whip it, whip it
Stacks boy, I can flip it, flip it
Tell that bitch to go and roll my joint
And all these niggas talking she can fucking get it
Clique black like gang, gang
Fourty-five go bang, bang
Got all these bitches dripping
Niggas dreaming, fiending
Wishing they can do the same thing
Smoking, rolling while I'm getting this dough
Bitches dripping, yeah, you already know
When a [?]
Come and [?]
Bitch it's dripping, dripping
While I was getting this dough
Baby said that can get it
Hungry, grinding, and I need it
Ass fat, she gon' sell it
Kill that bitch if she gon' tell it

[Pre-Chorus: Pressa]
I said, "damn"
All this ice on my wrist
All these bitches ---

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
(Damn!)
I just iced out my wrist
(Damn!)
I just balled in the mix
(Damn!)
They asking too many questions, plead the 5th
(Damn!)
I just poured a six in my Sunkist
(Damn!)
I just iced out my wrist
(Damn!)
I just balled in the mix
(Damn!)
They asking too many questions, plead the 5th
(Damn!)
I just poured a six in my Sunkist

[Post-Chorus: Pressa]
Damn, I just want to ice out my wrist
I just want them bitches on my dick
If you got a man, I'll be your man
I just want these bands on my neck
