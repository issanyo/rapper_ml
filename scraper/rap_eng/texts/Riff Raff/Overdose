[Hook: SD]
I think I'm 'bout to overdose, boy I think I'm finna overdose
I think I'm 'bout to overdose, boy I think I'm finna overdose
Bitch I be high as I can, all my niggas stay wasted
Bitch we gon' party it up, let's get turnt up
Bitch I be high as I can, all my niggas stay wasted
Bitch we gon' party it up, let's get turnt up

[Verse 1: SD]
My bitches drink, I like to smoke and we gon' party it up
I might just overdose, I think a nigga too turned up
Yeah, we get wasted in the clubs and have guns on us
I love drugs, it just make me wanna shoot some' up
These nigga's mad cause they bitches wanna fuck on us
I get her off a drink and watch that bitch get too turnt up
And we ain't wasted not a dollar, I don't pay for a slut
I know my squad want some top so let's party it up
I say my squad turned up, let's party it up
And when you fuckin' with the killers you don't want it with us
I say my squad turned up, let's party it up
I love a bitch off Xanax pills, watch how she get turned up

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
One way street driving backwards
I done shot so many jumpers call me Steve Kerr
I done made a couple million off prolific words
Step in Foxtails Mall, rockin' fox fur
The Bentley Azure, I done drove that
Five hundred rice sack I did in 2 hours
You know my pockets smell like sour and the gunpowder
Big balling every night like I'm Vanna White
My teeth crushed ice over white Sprite
I done sipped a whole pint at the stop light
Well over a million on my jewelery
Aw shit look who it is, the white Mr. T
