I'm popping Vicodins like vitamins and spike it with some Ultram
Like my leg was broken, but it's never over the counter
I’m talking only stuff that's potent and man I get to panickin'
When I don't get my Xanax, so I maxed out my Am-Ex
Causing massive kidney damage with that high powered chemistry
9 shots of Hennessy with 5 hour energy
Guess it's maybe safe to say that I'll try anything
Pop until I drop or start to wile out mentally
Had a blast in Amsterdam, adapted to my habitat
I smoke the fattest sack you thought I had some cataracts
Dropped so many tabs of acid that the lab was baffled
When they took my piss test had their asses flabbergasted
I got a dozen different Doctors and a pocket of referrals
Poppin' pills until I'm numb just like I got an epidural
Got a pile of Valuim and Jordan's full of harder shit
The pharmacist is lecturing about all the harm it did
But I don't listen cause I got a prescription
And I’m not paying attention to the fuckin' bottle's inscription
I'm mixing liquor with it just to give it that extra kick
I'll probably wake up in the morning not remembering shit
Hook
Hey stay faded, Keep them crazy
White boy wasted
Hey stay faded, Keep them crazy
White boy wasted
Hey stay faded, Keep them crazy
White boy wasted
Hey stay faded, Keep them crazy
White boy wasted
Verse 2: Cuzzo D
The party is whack 'n shit, hit your medicine cabinet
To see what you got in it, not hesitant, grabbin' it
Jackin' it, put it in my jacket for later
Fuck it, I'mma do shit, take it to the face then
Cleanin' out your codeine, droppin' all your Klonopin
Never take a few of 'em, always pop a lot of 'em
Toppin' it with crystal, but that shit got me twisted up
Saw my ex girl, I told her that I missed her
But I didn't, I was kiddin', I asked did she want to get
High, she was like why you got Marijuana
Nah, I got a grab bag like a pharmacists assistant
But you ain't getting shit because Karma is a bitch, kid
All my medicine is better than Excedrin
Got a lot of mescaline and hella pseudoephedrine
Hysterical seroquel, that shit is over rated
Fuck getting' faded, yo, I get eliminated
Verse 3: Riff Raff
Uh, one time for the vic's
Past midnight looking for a couple mics
Running red lights, red beam with the sights
Girls bringing rice looking better in the night
Carbon copy frame, I forgot her damn name
Looking at my chain might polar freeze your brain
It's a brain freeze, I could climb a tree
I could sneeze and cause a thunderstorm in Italy
Knock some promethazine
I could label print, white line, peppermint
Skinny bitches snorting lines, thin in the gym
Hanging on the rim, tin skin paper thin
Ay, I'm fucked up
Somebody pass me my cup
Ah shit, what all these lights looking like though
What all these lights looking like though
