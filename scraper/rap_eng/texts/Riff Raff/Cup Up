[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
And I don't even wanna drink yeah, to tell the truth
But every day they're leaving bottles in my dressing room
So who am I to tell them no, I guess I'll turn it up
I pour my liquor, pour my ice and then I stir it up

[Verse 1: Flatline Nizzy]
Uh, yo
I'ma just jump off the coupe
I'ma just ball like Sheryl Swoopes
I'ma just jump off the coupe
I'ma just ball like Sheryl Swoopes
I'ma just jump off the coupe
I'ma just ball like Sheryl Swoopes
I'ma just jump off the coupe
I'ma just, I'ma just-
Diamonds, put that on the top
Me, myself and the white Chris Rock
I'ma just Beverly Hills
I'ma just showcase mega skills
I pop a piff in my Fanta
I froze my heart like Alaskan panther
Me pull a bad from Sweden
Release the chain, got me bobbing and weeping
Trying not to catch a cold
My Range Rover, 24-karat rose gold
Watch when you climb in the interview
I'll drop an album in Hong Kong
I'll smoke a blunt in the synagogue
Watch me tip-toe through the pentagon (Damn, real)

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
And I don't even wanna drink yeah, to tell the truth
But every day they're leaving bottles in my dressing room
So who am I to tell them no, I guess I'll turn it up
I pour my liquor, pour my ice and then I stir it up

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
I might pull off with your wife
I boss up for the night
Double the cups with the Sprite
I go for rounds like a mic
I hit that bitch from the back
I didn't even take off the Nikes
She knew that I got a sack
But I ain't paying the price
I barely drink but I'm rolling up
I'ma let you get drunk, I'ma hold it up
You can't beef on my block, you ain't cold enough
Boy how you turning up? You ain't told enough
I took a break from the grind
Shorty was sending me signs
She heard I've been [?] 'em nice
And I run to feel like it's [?]
Ooh, I dropped the roof with the piff
She want me, I'm feeling her sis'
So I get the [?] off the riff
Ooh, I call another assist
Ooh, molly water helped me slide in it
[?] with your thighs in it
[?], might lie in it
Spark a blunt with three 5 in it
Molly water helped me slide in it
[?] with your thighs in it
[?], might lie in it
Spark a blunt with three 5 in it

And I don't even wanna drink yeah, to tell the truth
But every day they're leaving bottles in my dressing room
