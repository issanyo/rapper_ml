Yeah
Once again in this ho
Freestyle [?]
Bitch stop hatin
It ain't nothin

Hopped up two times, down toward Lufkin
Stage show in Alabama, maybe hit the grandma
My freestyle was outstanding
Call my yellow companion
Bitches looking good
Might molest the wood
Three-wheel through [?] with the gat under the hood
I done made my fifth faint, drank up a tank
Broke them boys off, automatic car crank
[?] two times on the shine
Rise up and shine, I'm'a bump, I'm'a grind
Riding on the North side, grind through the south
Wood wheel toss, two-story house in mouth
Did it on the South, did it on the East
Got pants with a crease
Starched down my knees
Got my niece looking good in the preschool
I'm'a do the fool in the damn high school
On top of the roof
Blowing on a [?]
I'm a two-timer
I done came down, washed my car with the primer
Maybe with the candy
Hoes can't stand me, screens down watching Bambi
Watching, what, Brandy, that's Moesha
Back in high school, fuck a teacher on the bleacher
I done drunk white, I done drunk stereo
I'm'a three-wheel with that boy, what, Mario
Mario Andretti
Low-pro Pirelli
Put a band-aid on your face like Nelly
R. Kelly, I'm'a piss on the scene
I done drunk lean
Codeine fiend, I be on the damn scene
I be looking good when I swang through the piece
Let them boys know I done ate a piece of pizza
With the bitch Mona Lisa
Caller her Julius Caesar
That's what I did
At the fucking Eisenhower
I'm'a come down, throw you off a water tower
What you gonna do, brain done expanded
Rims are gigantic
With that boy Danny
Danny, what, Taylor
Danny, what, Hawk
I done three-wheeled with that boy Marshall Faulk
I'm'a go blind cause of my diamonds
Barbecue reclining, I'm just 529'ing
That's all I'm doing
I done popped my trunk and three-wheeled through ancient ruins
What you gonna do
Leave you at a angle
I'm'a come down like the damn Kurt Angle
In Bermuda Triangle I done got lost
Popped me an X pill, wood wheel tossed
Laws pulled me over
I ain't even sober
I done driven through the cold with the boy Lil' Flip
Diamonds on my lip
I ain't gonna trip
I ain't gonna hype
I done came down with ice cause frostbite
I done caused a storm, in Desert Storm
When I swung my charm, set off car alarm
It was with Saddam, Saddam Hussein
Broke them boys off, let the fifth hang swang
Let it swang inside
Bitch-a hypnotize
Poppin' with some [?] infra-reds in your eyes
Maybe infra-blue
Grab your Visine
Starched down, clean, Riff Raff looking mean
Looking like a pitbull, baby blue nose
I'm'a pop trunk on fucking Pluto
And maybe Uranus
I done gone insane, insane in the membrane
I ain't no hyper
I done three-wheeled and stole a damn baby diaper
I'm'a be a sniper, I'm'a be a shooter
If you scared to fight, tell your mama to grab the Ruger
She can pull a gun
I'm'a flip my tongue
I was born and raised on that fucking Antwan
4-4, and I ain't gonna ho
Let them boys know out the fucking Sterling Grove
Maybe damn falls, hit the priest
Pants with a crease, used to rock damn valise
What you gonna say
I'm'a Tanqueray
I'm'a blind your sight on the damn[?]
Hit the Carver Park
Ain't no Jeep
Let them boys know off that fucking lucky streak
What you gonna say
I ain't even seen it
I done three-wheeled down, what, damn Venus
Venus, what, street
Baby hit the victory
Boys coming down, oooh it's a victory
Hold up the V
I done come down yellow and black like a bee
I'm'a cause honey
Like that boy said, pop trunk with a pocket full of money
I'm'a do it two times, I'm'a do it three
Let them boys know I got a black GMC
Time to hit a lick
With that Big Pic
Me and damn YungStar three-wheeled eating a ice pick
Eating on a staple
I'm'a come down, hold it down, pull cable
Fuck it
We gonna three-wheel with the maple
Talking about the syrup
I done popped trunk, I done had a little girl
I done had a boy, bought that boy a toy
I'm'a come down, might pull a Almond Joy
Might pull a ho
It's a Rolo
I done three-wheeled through Mary J. Blige video
She done got mad, she done tried to sign me
Laws tried to find me, I done moved to 290
Maybe 45
Maybe 610
I'm'a come back in a all-white Benz
Like it's cocaine, and I ain't stalking
Had to change my name from Riff Raff to Kokayne Dawkins
I done did it, and I put you in your place
I got more hoes than fucking MySpace
