YOUNGiN HAD A NiCE PERM
HAiR DONE iN SiCiLY
USED TO HAVE A BRiGHT WRiST
MOVE LiKE A SWORDFiSH
BORED WiTH REALiTY
HALF MOON GALAXY
COLD TO A WOMANS TOUCH
NEVER HAD TO HEAT ME UP
TOUCH ME WiTH YOUR BEST HEART
SOULS FROM THE OCTAGON
NEON FLAVORED WATERFALLS
RAiN FOREST OPTiCALS
THiNKiN BOUT YOUR BEST FRiEND
KiSS ME THRU THE EVERGLADES
MAN MADE HiGHWAYS
LAWS, CONSPiRACY
TRAP ME WiTH THE REGULATiONS
RULES FORM A TiME WARP
TiME FOR A FOREiGN CHANGE
ALTHOUGH i STiLL SEEK THE TRUTH
BUT iM STiLL A HUMAN FORM
MY FLESH iS A SYNAGOGUE
TEACH ME YOUR PEACEFUL WAYS
HORROR STORiES STRAY ME
EXiT ROOM GRACEFULLY
SUCKAS WANNA HATE ME
LiBRARiAN WANNA DATE ME
LOVE ME FOR YOUR CHiLDHOOD
YOU SHOULD BE MY BEST FRiEND
CHOOSE YOUR NEXT WiSELY
MY CHESS MOVES ARE PESSiMiSTiC
MY LiFE iS A KALEiDOSCOPE
TAKE TiME TO LOVE YOURSELF
ViOLENCE iS THE ROOT OF EViL
THOUGH i TALK TO NO ONE
STiLL i WiSH SUCCESS ON EVERYBODY (EVERYBODY)
NEVER HAD A CARBON COPY
I HOPE YOU HAVE A BEAUTiFUL FAMiLY
AND YOUR LABEL iS SUCCESSFUL, FiNANCiALLY
