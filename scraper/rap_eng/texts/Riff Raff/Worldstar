[Verse 1 - Riff Raff]

Tasers, house full of lasers, mouth fulla glaciers froze the outskirts of Asia
Medication, deep thoughts meditation
Pay me for a favor rap game Joe Frazier
Burberry pager swung suburban off a cliff
Raff riff, rap game Stromile Swift
Ain't nothin' to it dippin' a stick in embalmbing fluid
Cuttin' coke in the Buick rap game Martha Stewart
Now I'mma be a nice nerd, the Benz look like a iceberg
Opposite day, vice verse, 2 times, twice words
Swung through East Switzerland in a dopefiend rental
Crush the instrumental even without a pen or pencil
Yo whole squad garbage, I see why you lethargic
Swung through olive garden gettin' Egyptian massages
Now yow can gon and hate me but you can't navigate me
A 10 is what they rate me and ya sista wanna rape me
