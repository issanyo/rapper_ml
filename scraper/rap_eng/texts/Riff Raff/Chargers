[Intro]
Balling so hard, so hard
I could of played for the lakers

[Hook]
Freestyle lieutenant, Might be the sergeant
Never had to bargain, Could have played for the chargers
Ballin so hard I could have played for the Lakers
Threw so many touchdowns could have brought back the Raiders

[Verse]
Change up the flip, lights out the rent
Pull up with the grill it's the freestyle dentist
Might be a chemist, windows slightly tinted
Might Clark Kent, if iceberg is a menace
Changed up the cargo, with the deer antler
Now we in Chicago, Rap game Ryan Sandberg
Pull up Sammy Sosa, can't lose composure
Wake up like Folgers, chop the block like a dojo
Im flipping in my skin in anaconda skin benz
Just me and my kin in the salamander skin
We ain't with the mix, hawaiian linked surface
Now she getting nervous cause her phone out of service.. Riff

[Hook]
