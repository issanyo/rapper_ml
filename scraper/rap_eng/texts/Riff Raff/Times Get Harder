Times get harder, life gets ice, gets colder
Chip on my shoulder, Jody Highroller
Times get harder, life gets ice, gets colder
Chip on my shoulder, Jody Highroller
Times get harder, life gets ice, gets colder
Chip on my shoulder, Jody Highroller
Times get harder, life gets ice, gets colder

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
RiFF RAFF Branson
I just bought a mansion
My chain Grand Canyon
My diamonds dancing, like Tony Danza
Rose of weed, that I take for heathen
My Desert Eagle, rose gold showing off for people
20k a feature, for a show is 30
I know you heard me, don't get nervous
When I smile from behind the Rolls-Royce curtains
I didn't change, my rubies always rearranged

Times get harder, life gets ice, gets colder
Chip on my shoulder, Jody Highroller
Times get harder, life gets ice, gets colder

[Verse 2: Ghetty]
That thing that brawl
I didn't want it all
Pull up at the mall, make them hoes drop jaw
Young Kenny H, finna bring a pay
The way I ball, might just pull for long range
I'm not a stranger, lifetime of haters
I turn the pages, I flip the mattress and take these boys back to the basis, no paces
Homie, can't you tell I got no paces, them blue faces
All I want I think I'm racist
'Cause I'm grippin' wood
Now let's get this understood
When we ain't talking 'bout no money, then it must be something good
Then I wanna see me ball like this
I the guy colder, but I'm still grindin'
Call up Jody Three Moons, roll dice, Nevada
With the shashta and he pull up Panamera
All Star game, 50k in the mattress
Short time game, ayy, I ain't need no practice
