[Verse 1: Charlotte Devaney]

One plus one do the math
Solve the equation
You ain't ask

In too deep
Two feet on the gas
Better stay up
Stay up don't crash

CRASH

[Pre Hook: 1]
Twenty four seven is the dream
(Dream)
Party all night
Don't sleep, don't sleep
(Sleep)
I love my latte with a lil bit of cream
(Cream)
And a lil lemon if you know what i mean

[Verse 1: RiFF RaFF]

Uh yo uh
Fresh out the mall
(Mall)
The way i ball
It's the  white Chris Paul
(RiFF)
Top down and i'll
Pull up in the way
For-goodness sakes
(Sakes)

It's snowin' outside
Give a fuck
Get your ass in
I might pull up in a benz
Trade it in da next week
For the Olsen twins
Yahh

(Two)
Fifteen kay for the clothes
Strawberry rolex
Looks like Ruby Rose
(RiFF)

I'm at the codeine castle
Rockin' crab cazal's
(Uh)
I used to chop blocks
Up and down two-well
(Uh)
Me and Big Pink
I don't fuck around
Poll a six in my sun kiss
RiFF!!

[Bridge: Charlotte Devaney]
I want a gingerbread boy
From up in the hills
(With)
Money up to mars
Italian wheels
(Uh)
Baby come and show me how
A Stalion feels

Black on white
Like Cruella de Vil
