[verse 1:]
You use to call
Now you don’t
Leavin’ me all alone, (alone)
You use to care
Now you don’t even have time for me, (anymore)
We use to walk hand in hand
You would never let me go, (away)
And I thought that we could be, (could be)
But you ain’t doin’ nothin’ for me, (no)

[Chorus:]
What have you done for me
What have you done for me, Lately?
What have you done for me
What have you done for me, baby?
What have you done for me
What have you done for me, baby
What have you done for me
What have you done for me, baby

[verse 2:]
You use to say those words
That I wanted to hear, (so good)
You made me feel beautiful
I was in love with you, (so much)
Whether not, I would call just to hear you say, (my name)
(say my name, say my name)
Really thought that we could be, (could be)
But you ain’t doin’ nothin’ for me… (no)

[Chorus:]
What have you done for me
What have you done for me, Lately?
What have you done for me
What have you done for me, baby?
What have you done for me
What have you done for me, baby?
What have you done for me
What have you done for me, baby?

[rap: riff raff]
It used I flip my iphone
And get a text message from ya
Then I’d drop the top
And we’d ride out all summer
Takin’ trips to Milan
Buy Louis Vuitton
Then slide to Vegas
We can do it tomorrow
And at first it was all gravy
But now you done gone shady
You ESPN, NFL, rider for Tom Brady
And I ain’t trippin’
What you done for me baby
But can’t replace me
Cause I’m doin’ this sh*t crazy

[Chorus:]
What have you done for me
What have you done for me, Lately?
What have you done for me
What have you done for me, baby?
What have you done for me
What have you done for me, baby
What have you done for me
What have you done for me, baby
