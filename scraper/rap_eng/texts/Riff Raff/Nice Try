[Intro/Hook]
Nice try
Thought you had me angry, nice try
Thought you had me mad, nice try
Ballin on you and all you wise guys
Thought you had me angry, nice try
Thought you had me mad, nice try
Thought you had me angry, nice try
Ballin on you and all you wise guys

[Verse:Riff Raff]
Razor oats, Ball sherman oaks
Never being broke, 100 thousand around my throat
Watch me never joke, Wood wheel choke
They figured I was from Disney land the way I ride coast to coast
I'm gonna super soak, jet paint was caviar
Items in the car, marijuana in large jars
Could have been sub-par, played golf with Arnold Palmer
Rap Game ...[?] , Poured codeine on my Denver omelet
Wrist game luscious, man I'm so productive
100 thousand dollars, thats so far out my budget
Keep it below standards, swing through East Grambling
They figured I was in the kitchen the way I pan handle it
