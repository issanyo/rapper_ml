[Intro: Trouble Andrew]
That's just the shit I'm on
The shit I'm on, the shit I'm on
The shit I'm on, the shit I'm on
The shit I'm on, the shit I'm on

[Hook: Trouble Andrew]
Can't fit in, I don't try
In my own lane, you should do the same
Can't fit in, I don't try
In my own lane, you should do the same
Can't fit in, I don't try
In my own lane, you should do the same
Can't fit in, I don't try
In my own lane, you should do the same

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Hoped out the coup√© like MacGyver
Circular rotation like cycle
You see me 1st like the title
I got you mad like arch rivals
Rocky diamonds like Colorado, going Bravado
Outside of Ramada, grey dollars
Thunderstorm deposit, alcoholic
You need to hide the bottle
And I've never been basic
Based out the Matrix like a young Freddy Glacier
Young Bart Simpson, 2 story Tipton
Same skin tone as a young Richard Simmons
Advice and remedies in hills of Beverly
The same vicinity as substantial tendencies
Purple strangers with purple strangers
It's morphin' time, I'm watchin' Power Rangers
Or maybe I'll stay on top of your subject
Where I get paid in a bigger budget
And you ain't gotta love it
I got diamonds by custards on my exterior cover of my housing structure

[Hook: Trouble Andrew]
Can't fit in, I don't try
In my own lane, you should do the same
Can't fit in, I don't try
In my own lane, you should do the same
Can't fit in, I don't try
In my own lane, you should do the same
Can't fit in, I don't try
In my own lane, you should do the same

[Outro: Trouble Andrew]
Don't try, no I don't try, uh
I'm getting rich, that's just the shit I'm on
Don't try, no I don't try, uh
I'm poppin' bands, that's just the shit I'm on
Don't try, no I don't try, uh
I'm getting rich, that's just the shit I'm on
Don't try, no I don't try, uh
I'm poppin' bands, that's just the shit I'm on
The shit I'm on, the shit I'm on, the shit I'm on, the shit I'm on
The shit I'm on, the shit I'm on, the shit I'm on, the shit I'm on
