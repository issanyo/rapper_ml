[Hook]
Yeah girl, you alright
Let me fuck your friend, I might stay the whole night
I know it ain't traditional, but this is what I like
I'm talking two girls, one pipe
Two girls, one pipe

[Verse 1]
On the back of my Ninja bike, heading back to the Hampton's
Ain't no romancing, a lot of dirty dancing
Gotta go campin' for you to light my lantern
You can't leave your friend abandon, don't leave her stranded
Pull down her panties
I slap her ass, leave a hand print
Thong, Victoria Secret
If I tell you a secret, can you keep it
I like the way you speakin', ya'll should stay the whole weekend
I fucked her, left her leakin'
Versace mattress was squeakin'
While I'm fuckin', you could eat it
You next, so no sleepin'
About to jump out the deep end
Next week you should bring three friends

[Hook]
Yeah girl, you alright
Let me fuck your friend, I might stay the whole night
I know it ain't traditional, but this is what I like
I'm talking two girls, one pipe
Two girls, one pipe
