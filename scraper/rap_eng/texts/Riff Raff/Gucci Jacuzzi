[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Something gracious, is spacious, in a matrix
Lost since I was waist high, [?]
I've been safe, with all this hate, elevate
Every surface, while I'm surfin', for certain
They been searchin' in a perfect, refurbished, repercussioned, repositioned
In your car I repo down i make propane this ball is curdle [?]
Gotta crayfish, oops, i mean craw fish
See if I lived in Boston, and I
Shopped the Boston market, and I played at
Madison Square Garden and your dad looks like Dolly Parton
Gotta drink patron at a angle
And no fit for dangle
Could have played for Bengals
But I chose to sing the stars spangled banner
Disposed of all our manners
Jacuzzi surrounded by forty Gucci candles
While she does my manicures
All my sandals gotta rice-a-roni
Necklace look like isotoners
Isolated diamonds
Isosceles triangles
Swiss cheese
Outside the rangers gotta toy
Not a twist, this sequence consequences [?]

[Hook: Yung Elvis]
I got a lot of cash that I don't spend on coochie
I got these haters mad, Danny Bonaduce
Iâ€™m rollin' up that loud, my life is like a movie
I got your bitch soakin' wet in my Gucci jacuzzi

[Verse 2: Lil Flip]

[Verse 3: Crichy Crich]
It's Crichy Crich, biatch
Hold up, hold my cup while I eat this pussy
She ain't getting this dick if she ain't good looking
I ain't got time for nothing but models and money
If we in your club you better keep them bottles coming
Honey mustard Lambo, I'm blacked out on the dance floor
Got Miley Cyrus in my back pocket and a fat blunt in that Rambo
Fucked Ricki Lake in a Cadillac, snort a molly line off her ass crack
Have her snort crack off my nut sack, then I hit the road and don't call her back
Biatch, I'm in a Gucci jacuzzi
I got ten bitches all around me and their pussies are juicy
Keep a gang of killers with me and they packing them Uzis
I got cameras all around me like I'm filming a movie
I keep a cup full of Bonnie, I sip it till I'm retarded
I'm the life of the party, these crackers say that I'm gnarly
Roll my blunt so fat, I call that bitch Chris Farley
They say I'm too turnt up, I say I ain't even started
