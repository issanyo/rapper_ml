Hopped out the plane Rolls Royce pulls up
Leanin’ on leather and I roll one up
It ain’t a real Lambo less the doors go up
By the time I pulled up, she had one rolled up
One rolled up? I had one rolled up
One rolled up? I had one rolled up
One rolled up? I had one rolled up
By the time I pulled up, she had one rolled up
Red Carpet Kush in my five-ounce blunt
Cinco De Mayo in my cigar
2017 I don’t even need a car
Hundred shows a year got me feelin’ jet lag
I done got to the point where I don’t even pack bags
Leave my clothes on the floor at the hotel
Hit the mall and I spent like 12
Lamborghini Leg Lock and you know it’s top shelf
