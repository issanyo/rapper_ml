[Verse]
Watch me tip toe on my way to the top
Mozart pose by my lamborghini drop
Seven cellphones can't remember my last name
Motherfuck a bill my whole life is autopay
I can ride gray in the thunder storm Benz
Hoshitoshi TVs I can hang on the rims
Should of been a hooper shot more jump shots than Cupid
Should I monster truck or should I Candy Coupe it
Butterscotch skin while she tells me I'm famous
Would answer your call but I don't owe you no favors
Thirty one flavors like Baskin Robbins
My new haircut and my bangs I Judo chopped 'em
Jody 3 moons with the black light poster
I put on 50 pounds like that damn Sammy Sosa
I can Mark Mcgwire, I can not expire
Give me fifty mil might think about retire
All I ever wanted was to buy Versace islands
Candy coat the jet with two naked lady pilots
Can't see my diamonds 'Sace shades cover my eyelids
Macarena diamonds diamonds dancin' like Usher
Squats out in Sweden bench-press out in Russia
