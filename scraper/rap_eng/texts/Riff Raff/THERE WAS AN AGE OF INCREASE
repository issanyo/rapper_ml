Hook:
Look at all this gold that I got
(I got a light up on a hill, dollar bill
From sea to shining sea)
Look at all this gold that I got
(I don't really care about your trail of tears
This right here my destiny)

4x:
Look at all the gold that I got
Stack it to the ceiling

Verse 1:
I got house, I got jewels
I got too many horses
I got drink, I got food
I got too many courses
I got land, I got cotton
I got too many sources
I got money for my children
They won't ever know what poor is
I'm a shark, I'm a wolf
I'm a eat your heart for dinner
I'm a winner, finna kill a nigga if he hopping fences
I'm a send the men up north
And then don't care about no feelings
Separate them from their children
Since it's only business dealings
I'm a feel on women's inners
It ain't finished 'til I'm finished
Then it's I don't know that baby
I don't care if he's light-skinned
Order whippings but that blood
It better stay up off this linen
And then order ice water
Better put a lemon in it
Come kick it with me in the big house
I'm Big Daddy, let's pig out
You want rare steak on that fine china
In the summertime we bring ribs out
I'm watching the money flow
In my backyard
I'm ready for plenty more
And the facts are

(Hook)

Verse 2:
I got house, I got jewels
I got too many Porsches
I got golf, I got school
I got too many courses
I got stocks, I got bonds
I got too many sources
I got money in my blood
I won't ever know what poor is
I'm a shark, I'm a wolf
I'm a eat your heart for dinner
I'm a winner, finna get it even if I go to steal it
I'm invested in that prison
So intensify that sentence
Separate them from their children 'cause it's only business dealings
And I'm clipping women's privilege
Taking life is always sinning
Don't you ever read your Bible, it say that at the beginning
Order whips but I call it that 'cause that's the word that's trending
Wire me the finder's fee
I'm a confirm it when I get it
Make a killing without flinching much
That's why you see me grinning
I just get it how I live it
And the world continues spinning

(Hook)
