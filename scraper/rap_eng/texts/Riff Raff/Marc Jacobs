Yea I ain't never civil
Chain like a blizzard
Candy paint my motorsickle
Swangin' motorcycle
Leanin' like the Eiffel Tower
Swangin' on you cowards
Got your whole team sour like pork
Dunkin' on you dorks
Front page of the source
Got your wife wantin a divorce
Used to drive a Porsche
A Porsche Cayenne
Trappin' in Iran
Got me dodgin' trash cans
Dodgin' like a viper
Shootin' like a sniper
Shining like a lighter
Got you shitted like a diaper
Slangin' Boost Mobile
Bitch I'm global
Drop Testarossa, got my face up on a poster
I'm a poster child
And I'm versatile
Rockin' all this ice got me frozen for a while
Got me frozen for a while
Rockin' all this ice got me frozen for a while

I wake up, whole team rockin' Jacob
Right wrist Jacob
Other hand Jacob
I wake up, my whole body rockin' Jacob
Is they Marc Jacob?
Hell yea they Marc Jacob
I wake up, whole team rockin' Jacob
Right wrist Jacob
Other hand Jacob
I wake up, my whole body rockin' Jacob
Is they Marc Jacob?
Hell yea they Marc Jacob
