[Hook 2x: Ghetty]
Every time I come down
Playa you know what it is
When you see me in your town
Playa you know what it is
Watchu boys wanna do
Man you know what it is
You know what it is
You know what it is

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Hopped out fresh with some nice goods
Trappin in the forest, Robin Hood
Runnin' back across the country like I'm Forest Gump
I can Reebok, Pump Pump
Me and Justin Bieber in the Chrome Fisker
Sippin syrup at the Catalina Wine Mixer
Python belt with the cream blazer
Oh shit look who it is the white Walt Frazier
Whole team rockin' Marcus Jacob
What kinda cologne you wear?
I dunno, ask Chelsea Lately
I done came down with a pack of toys
In 3rd grade my favorite shape was a trapezoid
Diamonds blue and white with the Almond Joy
I'm crawlin' down the lane like a baby boy
Me and Jody Husky that's the neon puppy
Headed back to Kentucky in the candy bucket

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ghetty]
Swang through my city
Young Frank Nitty
Boys lookin' shitty
Cause I'm dancin' like I'm Diddy
Big pimpin' ain't trippin'
Like that boy Bill Clinton
Jukin' boys like OJ Simpson
Watch me shine and I glisten
Wood wheel twistin' Expedition
Ball like '04 Pistons
Bout my business countin' digits
Can I get me a witness
Retro J's from first grade
With a real tight fade
Breakin boys off plays
And I'm gon' chop blades
Get dough blowin' Dro
Real playas get chose
Comin' down choppin' fo's
Wit my AC froze
Full tank hit the bank
Screens fall like rain
Watchin' Belly on my celly
Man it's all in the game

[Hook]
