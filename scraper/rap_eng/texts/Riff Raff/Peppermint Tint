Breath is Peppermint

Sitting behind Tint

Breath is Peppermint

Sitting behind Tint

Breath is Peppermint

Sitting behind Tint

Breath is Peppermint

Sitting behind Tint

Knocking down the sun

Poom poom rest my shoulders

I done got non sober in the  panther range rover

Chopping up the road shoulder

It’s my choice

Playas hear my voice

In the airforce porche

I done got so hype

Don’t make me say it twice

Jody Highroller finna to pull out plenty dice

Syrup in my slice

Don’t make me get specific

Cross the damn pacific

Dont make it get too major

My goals plenty ways

Playas get off the stage

Broke up the gauge

Haters is in a maze

My grace is amazing

Haters game persuavement

Came right back

Rap game Katy Perry

Never been scary

My tint is Burberry

I done came through

I got more money than the tooth fairy

Haters see me

Rap game Chevy Chase

I put it in they face

Versace belt on my waist

Breath is Peppermint

Sitting behind Tint

Breath is Peppermint

Sitting behind Tint

Breath is Peppermint

Sitting behind Tint

Breath is Peppermint

Sitting behind Tint

Rap game Katy perry
