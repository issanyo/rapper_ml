[Hook] (x2)
Only I can cure your broken heart
Only I can cure your broken heart
Only I can cure your broken heart
Only I can cure your broken heart...

[Verse]
I'm wakin' up, she's shaken up
It doesn't look like we'll be making up
Shadows crossed in the distant [?]
I'm not really like these other guys
Your heart is mine, my soul is gold
They call me the Neon One
French tips, glowing eyes
They've labeled me the Golden Child
Don't limit me, I'm limitless
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my kiss
I really hate to be quaint, questions on my Anne Frank
My Anne Frank, questions on my Anne Frank
Like the other guys, diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my kiss, my kiss

[Hook] (x4)
