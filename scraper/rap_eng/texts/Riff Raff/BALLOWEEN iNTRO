[Intro]
Welcome to Balloween, hahahahaha
It's Balloween
(DJ Afterthought)
Everyone raise your glasses
It's amazing, staying away from the civilians on the pavement
As the leaves fall, notice how the mood changes
I just wanna be away from

[Verse: Riff Raff]
Swedish mockingbird as my my soul unfolds
90 degree turns rain curtains made of gold
Shimmy shake shadowboxing at the Orange Bowl
Blunts from North Pole, rose gold nose
Color coordinated, the banana Benz was bladed
Dr. Kevorkian the way I elevated
You gon' state the truth, diamonds cradled the youth
I might cop the coupe or the shark tooth saber-tooth
We are not equal, two tone the Visa
Too much talking mane, that's why I private plane
I evade the plain, too many stains
I invade your brain, codeine campaign
