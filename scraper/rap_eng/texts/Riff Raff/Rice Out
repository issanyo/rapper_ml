Rice Out
Girl don't make me bring the rice out
You already know I ice'd out my lighthouse
Don't make me bring the rice out (Don't make me bring the rice out)
Girl don't make me bring the rice out
You already know I ice'd out my lighthouse
Don't make me bring the rice out

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
You can be my job
If you stay out my business
Working out her body
Like it's physical fitness
Finna bring the rice out
Her friend was the witness (Okay)
Break me off with address
I ain't worried 'bout them digits
Walking on a tight rope
I should have been a tiger
Crawling down the lane
And I finna be a spider
Used to be broke
But now she got amnesia
3 am we scooping up
Her friend at the Libra
The way she walking to my car
You knew she was an actress (You knew it!)
Two hours later giving head on the mattress (Okay!)
4 am I'm breaking out the whole damn trap house
Cold on her skin, got gold on her skin
I was finna pull them stacks out
Now I'm pulling racks out
4 am and I'm still pulling packs out
Now we scooping up your gal
Heading to casino
Now I like to gamble
Eggs like I'm scrambled
(Ugh)
Stacks out
(Stacks out)
Yeah I'm finna pull the rice out (Rice out)
I said I'm finna pull the rice out

Rice Out
Girl don't make me bring the rice out

Don't make me bring the rice out (Don't make me bring the rice out)
Girl don't make me bring the rice out
You already know I ice'd out my lighthouse
Don't make me bring the rice out
