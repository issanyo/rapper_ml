[Intro]
I could sip a four
I could, I could sip a four
I could sip an eight

[Hook]
I could sip a four, I could sip an eight
I could've played for that damn Florida State
I can, I could fold fours, I could sip an eight
I could've played for that damn Florida State
I could sip a four, I could sip an eight
I could've played for that damn Florida State
I I fold fours, I could sip an eight
I could've played for that damn Florida State

[Verse]
Ultraviolet rays, I'm flossing candy gray
Cool whip coupes, sky blue berry braids
My Bluetooth is made by Versace
I could kamikaze, gingerbread Bugatti
I could switch lanes, Donald Trump private planes
Cranberry rings, stains drip the wood grain
I'm working the wood wheel, I tell you how I feel
I feel like this boy right here is a big deal
I told you how I felt, raspberry belt
Matching shirt silk, but let me paint the picture
I pull up candy pickle in the candy vehicle
Sipping codeine mixture
RiFF!

[Hook]
I could sip a four, I could sip an eight
I could've played for that damn Florida State
I can, I could fold fours, I could sip an eight
I could've played for that damn Florida State
I could sip a four, I could sip an eight
I could've played for that damn Florida State
I I fold fours, I could sip an eight
I could've played for that damn Florida State
