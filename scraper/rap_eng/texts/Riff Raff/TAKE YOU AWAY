[Hook]
I wish that I could just take you away
Just take you by the hand and just walk away
All these stars, and all these nights
We're both running wild so all I can do is drink
I wish that I could just take you away

[Verse 1]
The music stops when she walks in the room
A thousand dreams, I still smell your perfume
It's times like these that's larger than life
Flawless touch, she got me on vibes

[Hook]
I wish that I could just take you away
Just take you by the hand and just walk away
All these stars, and all these nights
We're both running wild so all I can do is drink
I wish that I could just take you away

[Verse 2]
You walk around town like you're just a girl
Got too much of what I need to even put into words
We're both running wild, no diamond rings
We could never be together, so all I can do is dream

[Hook]
I wish that I could just take you away
Just take you by the hand and just walk away
All these stars, and all these nights
We're both running wild so all I can do is drink
I wish that I could just take you away

[Verse 3]
The music stops when she walks in the room
A thousand dreams, I still smell your perfume
It's times like these that's larger than life
Flawless touch, she got me on vibes

[Hook]
I wish that I could just take you away
Just take you by the hand and just walk away
All these stars, and all these nights
We're both running wild so all I can do is drink
I wish that I could just take you away
