[Hook]
Yeah, yeah
I just wanna rock, at an angle
At an obtuse, calling at an obtuse
I just wanna rock, at an angle
Gripping wood and grain
Hawking, hawking turning lanes
I just wanna rock, at an angle
At an obtuse, calling at an obtuse
I just wanna rock, at an angle
At an obtuse, calling at an obtuse

[Verse 1]
Steel station, street sweep your surface, Sir Sargent Slaughter
No service cellphone worthless, I'mma purchase
Everything perfect, straw like salamander sandals, sandy serpent
4th down and 10 you get tackled, astroturf ribs
Gridiron, chill fries, deep sea, Kawasaki oil
And my blood's gone boil, temperature rises, might meet me
Outside the fire, lions, tigers
Swangin' just like Mark McGwire, swang like Forest Whitaker

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Carpal tunnel cars and tunnels, the summer cold, tundra
Be prepared to bundle stomach crunches and lunges
Lunches in dungeons, thunder from down under, disgruntle
Longevity, lunar eclipses, gypsy style travel
Trapezoid travel bags, terrified tandems
Can't fathom my phenom, my python venomous
Dennis the menace dimensions
Ignorant Lima beans the size of time machines
We diced on ice on devices made by Nike, night lights
Made from carbon
Copy Swiss rockets, my pitches, side of lockets of necklace
Of orphans eating porridge outside of the queen's fortress
Who can afford Porsches but refuse to purchase
Soul components for the young and unfortunate

[Hook]
