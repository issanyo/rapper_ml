[Intro]

[Hook: Amber Coffman]
Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never be free, I just wanna be

Look at me
I just, I just can't believe
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never be

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
In this game I'm Thomas Clarke
Shark wave on the back of my hand
It sugar coated in gold and ice, I'm golden, I
Have golden eyes, passenger has golden thighs
Try not to divide the whole spectrum
Look through negativity, that was forced in my direction
While I air shock the intersection
Diamonds give off reflection
That could be bad for your protection
31 days on the JodyHighRoller-Coaster, I
Make the sun hot, rap game summer solstice
Untamed the details, neon smell on females
Heart on cloud 9, 4 bricks
In the Benito Santiago, I go Andre Dawson, Carlton Fisk
In the pineapple Sunkist
Ballin' on you and your bitch
Riff, Riff, Riff...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
Yeah, I was in the game by 17
Bought a couple stocks out of Palestine
Did a couple favours, you don't owe me
Soft through the foggy lights and the codeine
8 days out the week I'm in the major leagues
Had to wash my heart off in the kitchen sink
5 out the gate, I'm at the dry cleaners
Other side of Mississippi, about to buy the ocean
Lamb chops over rice in the vodka boats
Calamari shrimp, passing me some lobster rolls
Leanin' my ox tail[?], on the icon boat
Inside my mind, kaleidoscope

[Hook]
