Message TX-35:
Right now at this exact very moment
Riff Raff is on planet Nebular with bad broads
If you do not have any money for him, please stop calling
Thank you
Goodbye!

Hmmm
It's only ten minutes away (x4)

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
First step red, left foot tropical
'Sace on my optical, jumping over obstacle
Courses, swangin' through the land of the Porsches
Parallel forces on the trails out in Oregon
Swam through the ocean on a corpse of two horses
Focus on the morse through the hologram portrait
Centerfold my arsenal, ten toed ostriches
Define the hypothesis on a [?] is impossible
Obnoxoius, don't come at me at an obtuse
Grey Goose noodles disintegrate body molecule
They be like damn, who is him, who is him?
I put you in a box same shape as a rectangular prism
Put you in a box same shape as a stick of margarine
A tube of toothpaste carrier, Nintendo game cartridge
Artwork, partially
Part time pop hitmaker
Opposite day earthquaker in a Matrix Anita Baker
Go to sleep on fettucini, mainly pasta
Stand up straight when you talk to me, use better posture
Proper, all my mattresses Sealy Posturepedic
Your gal got cleavage like Leave It To Beaver
You took her to a LeBron James game and you tried to leave her in Cleveland
Didn't happen
I ain't gonna stop rapping
I ain't gonna stop high-capping

[Hook] x2

Raylon (?), mask and nails get sprayed on
My face on the stamp of the envelope was mailed on
Hit hard, Julio Cesar
Shoot shots, show example why I play the 2-guard
On top, same side the roof's on
Roll the window down, ask for Grey Poupon
2 Homes, 8 room, 2 zones
Too many hoes, you thought it was a Groupon
Look too good, make you nervous
Take you into custody, child protective services
Just ate, 2 Steaks
Stomach full, still room for champagne
Full moon, ass cool like blue flame
Mike Seaver, no growing pain
Full court press, Jackie Tolliver (?)
Ten dimes i'ma get my dollar's worth
