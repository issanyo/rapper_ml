[Intro]
808 Mafia, Riff
Yeah, it's a celebration, quinceanera
I might, I might, I might move to Mexico
Riff

[Hook]
Diamonds shining jumping out the gym
I might move to Mexico, Carlos Slim
I fly past in the black Camaro
It's a celebration, quinceanera
It's a celebration, quinceanera
It's a celebration, quinceanera
Diamonds shining jumping out the gym
I might move to Mexico, Carlos Slim

[Verse 1]
Fish scale, shark tail
I used to test coke for the cartel
Seven hundred grand in a rubber band
Watch my diamonds dance out in South France
Whoa, kemosabe, Versace is my hobby
I done shot more jumpers than that Bill Cosby
House player made, Prada shades
Codeine Castle got a pool full of mermaids

[Hook]
Diamonds shining jumping out the gym
I might move to Mexico, Carlos Slim
I fly past in the black Camaro
It's a celebration, quinceanera
It's a celebration, quinceanera
It's a celebration, quinceanera
Diamonds shining jumping out the gym
I might move to Mexico, Carlos Slim

[Verse 2]
Peach Beach, East Greece
Diamonds dancing off my teeth, Forgiotos creep
I can't be held back, no leash, capisce?
Underrated, often hated
Bentley roller bladed, Cadillac is Escalated
Speakers Fosgated, life's getting better
It's a celebration, quinceanera

[Hook]
Diamonds shining jumping out the gym
I might move to Mexico, Carlos Slim
I fly past in the black Camaro
It's a celebration, quinceanera
It's a celebration, quinceanera
