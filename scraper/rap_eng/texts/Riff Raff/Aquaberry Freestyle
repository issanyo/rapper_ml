[Verse]
Off the glass like Benjamin Wallace
Came through with Versace wallet
Pop collar, choose to stack dollars
Came through in a '01 Impala
I did that, I traded my Benz back
Let my top up, just to show I can bump or subtract
Came through not specific
I can freestyle terrific , and my Benz is lifted
Off the ground, 20 inches if I want to choose
I could beg, you could lose, I could bomb your troops
'Sace on shoes, 2000 or better
Came through with my name in Chinese letters
Stitched into my letters, got a nice Beretta
If these haters wanna sweat 'em, I could ice your sweater
Put a peephole in your eyes all for chad
I'd ball on your dad, piece and chain touch my abs
Ice berg on my shirt, and it has to hurt
I can ball berserk, with the syrup in my Squirt
It's the baja blast, I can syrup and shast
I can 'Sace on cast, but I done broke the mic
I done syrup in sprite, I balled with Kevin Knight on the side of the ike (I did that)
In, on a half a cream soda
I could ball on your shoulders, it's Jody Highroller
It's Jody 3 Moons, rap game Warren Moon
I done woke up at noon, my album drop in June
24th I played this game like a sport
I can smoke a Newport, with my hands in my pocket
In the lands of the rockets, and they have to hate it
I can Cadillac Escalade it and my Versace was bladed
But I did that, came through
Almost got a ticket cause my rims wouldn't stop spinning backward
I could smoke backwoods, in the forest
Freestyle was gorgeous, but they couldn't afford us (too much paper)
I used to flip in Ford Taurus, the impact was effective
Used to, shoot jumpers with both hands ambidextrous
This left hand, used to ball like Brian Leftwich
The left hand twitch, cause it's frostbit
I got a nice Rolex, it's 40K
Used to rock grey thunderstorm in LA, I did that
I used to pop a bean, drop a screen, shoutout to Adrian Green
Must of flipped a tangerine, it was infinite
I got so many rings, I could've balled for Olympics
It's the triple beam dream team, stacking green
