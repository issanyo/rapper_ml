[Hook]
I break away
I've seen torture through these eyes
Now i'm focused in my mind, I break away
Let me in, I break away
Let me in, I break away
I've seen torture through these eyes
Now I'm focused in my mind, I break away

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Now I'm here, so let me be
Why do they hate so frequently
This dream I have, paved in gold
Minds adjust on a neon soul
I keep it cool in depths of bay
45 nights, I sip champagne
Trust no one when switching lanes
I make it rain, tornadoes, hurricanes

[Hook]
