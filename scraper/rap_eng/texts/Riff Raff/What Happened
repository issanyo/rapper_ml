[Intro: Lil Pump]

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Louis all over my bag, forty bands on my lap, ouu, damn
Louis all over my bag, forty bands on my lap, ouu, damn
Flippin' the pack, countin' the racks, fuckin' your bitch in the trap, ouu
Countin' the racks, flippin' the pack, fuckin' your bitch in the trap, ouu

[Verse 1: Lil Pump]
Fuckin' your bitch off a Xanny, damn
Nut on your bitch in a casket, damn
Bitch, I am not from the planet, damn
I don't know what the fuck happened, damn
Couple thots on a jet ski, damn
Ridin' 'round in a Bentley, damn
Look at my shoes, it's Giuseppe, damn
Bitch, I been countin' the Fetti

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Louis all over my bag, forty bands on my lap, ouu, damn
Louis all over my bag, forty bands on my lap, ouu, damn
Flippin' the pack, countin' the racks, fuckin' your bitch in the trap, ouu
Countin' the racks, flippin' the pack, fuckin' your bitch in the trap, ouu

[Bridge: RiFF RAFF]
Yeah, hol' up man, hol' up, let me sip some syrup real quick
Hold up (yuh)
Aight (aight, aight, aight)
Yuh (aight), ayy (aight)

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
Mild as bird, Pump (Pump), I can make a hater jump (jump)
Came a long way from flippin' Mister Bitch Galump (Galump)
Maybe DMR (uh), RiFF RAFF, Lil Pump (Pump)
I done came down, got more gold than leprechaun
RiFF-

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Louis all over my bag, forty bands on my lap, ouu, damn
Louis all over my bag, forty bands on my lap, ouu, damn
Flippin' the pack, countin' the racks, fuckin' your bitch in the trap, ouu
Countin' the racks, flippin' the pack, fuckin' your bitch in the trap, ouu
