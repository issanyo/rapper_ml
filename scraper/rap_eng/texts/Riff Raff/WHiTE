This that paper tat life, white sheet white walls
White bitch, white cars
This what I hustle white for
Gotta watch out for them white boys
This that paper tat life, white sheet white walls
White bitch, white cars
This what I hustle white for
Gotta watch out for them white boys

[Verse 1 Casino]
White bricks I cop 'em out the white house
Riding round in a white ghost
A black nigga but I'm living like them white folks
Black skin but I wash it with some white soap
Hit the weed and I'm blowing out white smoke
With my brother future rocking out them white shows
They think I'm KKK the way I rock the white ropes
All 14 audemar, it's white gold
White diamonds and they shining like some head lights
That's why I fuck with white girls, cause they head right
My uncle got an old school, sittin' on white walls
Bustin open bricks, watchin' that white fall

This that paper tat life, white sheet white walls
White bitch, white cars
This what I hustle white for
Gotta watch out for them white boys
This that paper tat life, white sheet white walls
White bitch, white cars
This what I hustle white for
Gotta watch out for them white boys

[Riff Raff]
I'm always late
Like I'm kin to Ferris Bueller
In the kitchen whipping white
Like that Martha Stewart
I grain grip paint drip when I lane switch
The way I water whip I damn near got a sprained wrist
Ye ain't heard man my birds need a spray tan
Rice packs sacked up like Michael Strahan
But now it's payback cherry black Maybach
Ahh shit look who it is the white Warren Sapp
Hop back clean my fifth cost 10 stacks
We ain't talking about my neck or my fucking wrist
Dont wanna talk about your bitch cause she counterfeit
Pass the kiss eyelashes with the fake ass
All that make up on I think she need a ski mask
Its RiFF RaFF and my car cost a hundred flat
Its a 100K everytime I leave the driveway
100mph we talking Porsche Panamera
You want a feature man that shit cost 9k
You wanna hook man that shit gonna cost a haystack
Shoulda got full coverage but you bought a lemon
I'm wheels of fortune, man, we talking Pat Sajak
I pay for dinner but I coulda bought a Cadillac
I bought a Cadillac I wrecked that bitch at subway
Me and Jackson chopping rice with a razor blade
Iced out driving backwards down a one way
Lungs phased and that kush is from outer space
Expensive taste make you wish that you could take my place
We balling Thursday
It's only Monday
But my ways make you feel like its a Friday
RiFF
