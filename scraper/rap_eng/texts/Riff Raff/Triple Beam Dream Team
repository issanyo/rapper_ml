[Intro]
Uh, dream team
Triple beam, dream team
Used to, used to life
Uh, yo, uh, yo

[Hook]
Triple beam dream team
Used to weigh my life on a triple beam
Stepped on the scene in my robbing jeans
Balling so hard y'all should triple team
Triple beam dream team
Used to weigh my life on a triple beam
Stepped on the scene in my robbing jeans
Balling so hard y'all should triple team

[Verse 1]
Yo, uh, chain medusa
Rock a voodoo
I can shock the world, Shaka Zulu
Stopped at the light, red or white
I hit the dealership for that benz bike
Hol' up, slo' up
Purple cups for my big thugs
Big drugs, hella plugs
Can't show no more love, yall get mean mugs
Collard green diamonds look like poison ivy
I'ma nice guy with some icy vibes
Ice orange diamond look like hot fries
I could slang a whole chicken baby, Popeyes

[Hook]
Triple beam dream team
Used to weigh my life on a triple beam
Stepped on the scene in my robbing jeans
Balling so hard y'all should triple team
Triple beam dream team
Used to weigh my life on a triple beam
Stepped on the scene in my robbing jeans
Balling so hard y'all should triple team

[Verse 2: Poodeezy]
Ay, ay, triple beam no [?]
Thought it was Mr Clean
But hundred dollar in her jean
On my swagger man
I sell wraps of [?]
That's a triple scheme
I had to tell my girl to chill
That thing ain't what it seems
Bitches on my line but I ain't got no time to chat
I reveal six hoes at once just like it's Tinychat
They wearing swash fake Rolex watches, ain't got time for that
I made the gang, the reservation where you'll find me at
Young insomniacs, it's 3AM up in that booth
It made [?] famous, [?] went and saw my tooth
They need them girl as diamonds, wetter than Niagara Falls
I should switch up on you niggas, Southpaw

[Hook]
Triple beam dream team
Used to weigh my life on a triple beam
Stepped on the scene in my robbing jeans
Balling so hard y'all should triple team
Triple beam dream team
Used to weigh my life on a triple beam
Stepped on the scene in my robbing jeans
Balling so hard y'all should triple team
