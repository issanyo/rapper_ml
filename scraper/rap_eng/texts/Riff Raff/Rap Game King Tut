[Intro]
Yuh (yuh), Riff, I'm the Golden Child
Golden Child...Golden Child...Golden Grahams...

[Bridge]
Poppin' pills, workin' wood wheels
Poppin' pills, workin' wood wheels
Poppin' pills, workin' wood wheels
Part time King Tut

Poppin' pills, workin' wood wheels
Poppin' pills, workin' wood wheels
Poppin' pills, workin' wood wheels
Poppin' pills...

[Hook] (x2)
Riff Raff, I'm the Golden Child
Riff Raff, Golden Child
Riff Raff, I'm the Golden Child
Riff Raff, I'm the Golden Child

[Verse]
Twist the game, out in the sun
Candy bitch, candy tongue
40k, that's without the wrist
Raff Riff drunker than a sonofabitch
Hog the lane, bleed the block
Pulling up the lock, candy chrome drop top
Drive into the wind, I can't lose
That J. Lo - nah bitch, Penelope Cruz
Freeze stunner, wave runner
Ruin your summer in a tangerine Hummer
Leave you shitting, like a plumber
Poppin' pills in a Mary Kay dumpster
Poppin' pills in a Mary Kay dumpster
Poppin' pills in a Mary Kay dumpster
Poppin' pills in a Mary Kay dumpster

[Bridge]

[Hook] (x2)

[Outro]
Part time King Tut
Part time King Tut
Part, part time King Tut
Part time King Tut
Part, part time King Tut
Riff Raff, I'm the Golden Child
Riff Raff, I'm the Golden Child
Part time King Tut
