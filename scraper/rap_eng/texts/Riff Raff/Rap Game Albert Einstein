Einstein
Catch me in the club rolling paper and the pine
Pay for twenty sack, might pay for me a dime
Intelligent with the mind
Rap game Einstein
Rap game Einstein
Catch me in the club rolling paper and the pine
Twenty sack fat, might pay for me a dime
Intelligent with the mind
Rap game Einstein

[Verse 1: RiFF RaFF]
30 pull back guess
Hit the scene Leon Lett
Jumping out the jet, neon stretch Corvette
Freeze the whole house, talking colder than the winter
You ain't rocking chinchilla bitch, that's doberman pincher
Swisher, split the middle, feel the stones, buried head to toe
Venom touch the floor, forty pounds of hydro
Bugatti, Maserati, rolling papers by the genius
Balling out in Phoenix on you sons of ballerinas
Twisting up the profit, table tops, make my spot
Stars Wars clocks, stormtrooper by the block
Keep the lungs clean, at least partially untarnished
Balling on you farmers with Versace car starters
