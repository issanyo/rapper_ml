Chorus:
My name is Popular
I done hit the parking lot in a Bentley Truck
You know I stay up all night I live so dangerous
I drank a pint of codeine hope you can hang with us
Woahhh Yeahhh
(2x)

Verse 1:
It's Craig Mack
My thoughts wander, great beat on
I wave my wand
My carry on Louis Vuitton
Filet mignon
Never cool with my neighbors
The wallpaper was designated for Darth Vader
I'm Walter Payton
I'm Gary Payton
They figured I was kin to Antarctic the way that I'm skating
The plum raven cranberry bat cave
Ahh shit look who it is the white LeBron James
The kool-aid cool grade is a great A
The game's people play out silence with a razor blade
A rusty razor blade I might pull up in ace of spades
I take a flight to Spain just to heat a baked potato

Chorus
