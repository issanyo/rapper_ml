[Intro]
Yeah, uh

[Verse]
Blue suit pressed, see-through tooth was oriental
A teal tone lobster prepared for my arrival
With two steaks, two grapes on paper plates
Caused two blind dates when I showed my Rollie face
A diamond doctor, I showcase patients without waitin'
I jump out the Wraith and start skatin'
An ice skater, a figure skater, uh
Figuratively speakin' they prepared for my impeachment
Mango seats with peach tint
My pajamas, Gucci lint
That's not what I meant, I'm heaven-sent, uh
Sent from above with diamond gloves
I'm Bo Jackson of tax season
Yeah, step outside, point at the sky
Blowin' smoke out my lungs as wolves cry, uh
The chance taker, I shook dice with Vinny Baker
I load the Desert Eagle faster than you can do your make-up
I'm past you poindexters
I'm fashionably late to late-night studio sessions with Willie Nelson
But I can sing a hook like I'm Garth Brooks
Came a long way from dodgin' crooks at Forest Brook
Keep the balcony closed, they got binoculars
Keep my philosophy locked up with my hypothesis
Possibly, I could speak freely from the afterlife
'Til then charcoal trenchcoat with the apple sight
Crisp cut Jodie Highroller with the motor oil
Had to think twice, because I'm bipolar
Chip on shoulder, it was made by Louis Vuitton
