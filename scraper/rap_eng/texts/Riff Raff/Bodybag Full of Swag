[Intro: RiFF RAFF]
And my swag on zero
But I should have been a hero
Full of that coke
Bodybag full of coke
And my swag on zero
Swag on zero
I should have been a hero

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
And my back pocket full of x pills
And my right pocket full of that dro
And my left hand holding on a cup
And my back left full of that coke

I'm full of that coke, you full of that coke?
Yeah I'm full of that coke, full of that coke?
Yeah I'm full of that coke, full of that coke
I got a bodybag filled up with coke, I'm full of that coke

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Cranked on lean, bottled promethazine
Winter fresh codeine, in my cup pinecone green
December feel like summer
Now I'm outside and I'm jumping out the Hummer
I'm jumping candy pumpkin, I'm shooting like a jumper
The way I got them hating
Penguins got them skating
Nurses wanna date them and producers Ricki Lake them
Put me on a show and I've never been a ho
And I workout like Tae Bo
Got me leaning, jumpin out the stretcher and I'm codeine fiending
High like a fif', it's the RAFF RiFF
Diamonds are like presents, I give them as a gift
I wood wheel twist

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]

[Verse 2: LeanTeam Ray Jesus]
Ray Jesus' swag never on zero
Your boy see me coming to ya town, I'm a fucking hero
Your boys (?), swag niggas never bagging
Boys on the grocery store, you see me I'ma snaggy
Girls on my toes
Yeah she like to flow
Wiz Khalifa can't roll

That boy steady lacked
In the Maybach
With Rick Ross swag, nigga and I got the hottest (?)
Your boys talking shit all the day
I sell mothafucking grams like retirement homes
Boys like the (?) home, swagging on a football field
I got zans, and yes i make fucking deals

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]

[Verse 3: LeanTeam PHiL NyE]
Wowzers, Swisher Sweets fill my trousers
Michael Myers flow, chasing all you cowards
Blunt after blunt, yeah that's all I do for hours
Leaning off that good punch, I swear it gives me powers
E.T. swag, staying late that's after hours
Just touched down your ho, bringing you some flowers
Now we talking showers
My explorer Eddy Bauer
Climbing up this tower just to smoke some sticky sour
Gave me by the hour, I need that fucking green
Smoking on some sour shit, you know that's fucking mean
Purple in my cup, call me Paris Hilton now
Bitches on my D just to blow me down

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]

[Verse 4: LeanTeam Z]
I'm full of that coke

I got that soap on the rope
You know I got that tape and I'm 'bout to fucking blow
It's called the mixtape, 'bout to spit that shit yo
I'm going freestyle, and you know I'm going real wow
That shit Tarzan but I got that real style
That real style cuz I got that real flow
It doesn't even matter cuz I'm blowing back dro
I'm blowing back dro
I'm blowing back dro
You know I'm posted up and I'm blowing back dro
(I'm blowing back dro

You know I'm posted up and I'm blowing back dro)
