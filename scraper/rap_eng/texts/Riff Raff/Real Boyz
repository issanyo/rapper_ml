[Hook 1: OJ Da Juiceman]
Fuckin' with them real boys, real boys (x3)
Now you fuckin' with them real boys, real boys
[Hook 2: RiFF RaFF]
Diamonds Twerkin on my wrist like Miley Cyrus
Young ass baller smoking weed on your couch

[Verse 1: RiFF RaFF]
I done got so famous I can't even drop my top (Soooo famous)
I done got so famous I can't even grocery shop (damn)
I don't trust my butler so I'm installing hidden cameras (Cameras!)
I need a security guard just to walk to my mail box (damn)
I need a secretary just to check my e-mail (e-mail)
Dodging paparazzi I might need a v12 (new car!)
Getting in shape I might need a V8 (Vroom)
Aqua berry diamond shining dancing in yo face! (face!)
I can lemon lime (Lime), can't wait in line (line)
I just dropped 30 grand and froze the hands of time (Froze!)
Now I'm Doogie Howser with the polar bear fist (fist)
Diamonds dancing on my wrist like Taylor Swift (Swift)!

[Verse 2: Cap 1]
Young rich baller, got me smoking on the couch
I might need another ho, I just kicked this other ho out
I might need another plug, I just told this plug off
I might need another crib, got too many hoes in my loft
Told that the bitch if she want finer things in life
Then she should come fuck with a boss
Fucked every bitch in Atlanta like these hoes
Must think that I play for the Hawks
Front door then back door a nigga [???]
Then fuck off that money and go off to Vegas
Make me a stop out in Texas, connect to that lean
Bout to get me some paper
Fucking with these real boys got a nigga reckless
Pull up in that foreign, got your bitch with my necklace
Step out them Versaces, put my foot in them Giuseppes
Can't even show my face without these bitches tryna' sex me!
