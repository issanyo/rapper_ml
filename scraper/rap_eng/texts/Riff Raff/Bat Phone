Adversaries call me on my Blackberry
Adversaries call me on my Blackberry
On my cell phone, now I'm on my iPhone
She thought it was the cat phone, now I'm on my bat phone

[Verse 1: Ghetty]
Uhhh
Flipping on the scene, I feel like Charlie Sheen
About to pour some lean, just popped half a bean
Now I'm jumping out the gym like Gerald Green
Nothing in my Swisher but that kerosene
All about Hamiltons, Texas Rangers
Balling like the Pacers, call me Danny Granger
Do not talk to strangers, because it might bring danger
They could run up with that banger, send you to the angels
Feel like Patrick Ewing, pull up in that Buick
Bad bitch on that fluid, want me to chop and screw it
Got a friend, they both looking nice
Call Jody Highroller, tell 'em bring the rice

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
Versace station wagon, ride insurance Nationwide
About to start making waves, high tide
A high side, I glide like Clyde, doors suicide
30 karat baguettes got my body jewelified
My blades cut like it's some knives in the moonlight
Dim the lights, battery low from my trunk thunder
My shoes Barry Larkin, my feathers goose parka
Gucci waterfalls, rap game Stacey Augmon
Summer hummer I'm dodging dumpster
Pull up at your college and I look like Wayne Wonder
I bring Nevada in the caramel coated apple
My bat phone, I'm trying to develop a new chapter
Riff
