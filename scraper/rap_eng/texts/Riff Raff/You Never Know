[Verse: RiFF RaFF]

30 on the sun, 720 on the dunks
Perm pressed hair smells like Sharon Stone
Pluto-shaped ass, eyes made by White Castle
Young Malpractice, attractive girls acting ratchet
Now I’m flabbergasted, showcase fashion across the atlas
Duct tape an actress to the mattress, Fatal Attraction
Moon boots fastened, might be Lake Placid
Don’t worry about asking, Egyptian traffic getting sandblasted
Daughter in the locker, choose to be the stalker
Lipstick on my boxers while her mom playing soccer
Coogi Mittens help, chain looks like Orion’s Belt
Pull up in the chariot with the glow in the dark Bart Simpson haircut
When my day begins, flawless women friends
With tactical air brushed golden skin, unblemished physique
Rap Game Dawson’s Creek
Volcano liquid lava Benz
Feels like the world is about to end
