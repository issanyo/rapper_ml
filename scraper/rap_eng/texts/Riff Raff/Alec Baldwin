[Hook: Caskey]
Things done changed, word to Biggie Smalls
I'm always on time in my city dog
They ain't fuckin' with me at all
I'm getting' rich and die tryin', man, 50s and all
Kind of, kind of strange, everybody callin'
Because I'm makin' change and I don't know what to call it
They say if you ain't out here ballin'
Then you just another white boy, Alec Baldwin
Yeah, sayin' I'm the best out
But he just blowin' money with the chest out
He ain't just another white boy, Alec Baldwin
Sayin' I'm the best out
If you ain't out here ballin'
But he ain't just another white boy

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Yo money is the concept
So blowin it like it's imaginary, man it's rather scary
I went through like thirty racks in just a month
I ain't tryin' to stunt, that's my boss job
Blew like 15K on weed and the blunts
I come to eat 'em up, appetite for the after life
Spent more money on my folk, that's a sacrifice
In my apartment complex eatin' mac and rice
So I got that call from Cash Money that bought me back to life
I'm back to writin', whole crew been enlightened
You just old news, I'm Pro Tools, Mike Tyson
With a bite license, man these rappers, they ain't shit to me
Swear I don't need to know their name or their history
Visually I’m a psychadelic, acquired relic
All these rappers quite hellish, I think they jealous
Shiit tell 'em embellish in the fruits of your labor
But always share your fruits with your neighbor
They hate on me cause..

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Look I ain’t one of these rappers who only rappin' ‘bout money
But I ain’t knocking neither, I guess we all just one hundred
With hundreds you know I’m just playin’ in my position
They say I come to entertain with intuition
I’m into fruition, she ain’t got to have apple bottom
But she got to have an onion booty with a hundred problems
You know, Hova said I got my 99
Women always more complex that’s might fine with
Me, I had a homie tell me: “go take over the city"
I told him what you mean
He said "you know like 2 Pac”, I say give me two shots
Plus the L, boy that ain’t no biggie
Like I’m always skinny, franchisin' while my grands pilin
I leave you like I stand in the air pollin'
Ain’t no deny my criteria, I swear drop a hundred mixtapes
In my city, I swear nobody hearin' ya', you little bitch

[Hook]

5 hundred degreez, 50,000 flames
Oh shit, look who it is, the white Lil Wayne
The Kruger slang, I shift gears and my Jar Jar plane
They figured I was kin to Martin Payne the way I switch lanes
Yeah, baby blue diamonds cost a baby carriage
Macarena diamonds dancing like Mariah Carey
The red baron I fly low in the Rick Flair Maclearen
Spent my first hundred grand on that Panamara
Droppin' 25k out in Las Vegas
I would take a nap but that’s lost wages
I’m movin' 50 pack like that Cary Collins
I’m pushin' 30 rocks like the Alec Baldwin
