[Pre-Hook: Riff Raff]
Pulled up in a foreign
Mango orange
Worldwide touring
Your life so boring (x2)

[Hook: Riff Raff]
Imma hit the gas (x16)

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
I'm smokin' on gas
He smokin' on trash
From the first to the last
I'm countin' up cash
I'm rockin' this Rollie
You flexin' that phony
You act like you know me
But we ain't homies

[Verse 2: Adamn Killa]
Foreign everything, floral double G
Wake up make the racks in and out repeat
Make it in my sleep I got the recipe
Niggas talk a lot but man talk is cheap
Rivieras on my feet you can't even buy these
I do what I please, I do what I please
I don't sit check, I sit back
I got money I might get fat
I make more than your old ass
Bitch my pockets on that old ass
If it's money I need more of that
For that talking let's make more racks

[Verse 3: DJ Afterthought]
Yeah, uhh
Purp pressed like clockwork
Codeine stains on her Versace miniskirt
Don Lucas on the 3rd and the 1st
Accidentally spilled too much syrup, my squirt
Dirt on my shirt to prove that I put in work
So many haters, too many papers
Bought 'em a lam as an icebreaker
