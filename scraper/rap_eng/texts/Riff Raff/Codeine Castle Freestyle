[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Rocks on my hand and I'm thinking grand canyon
Knew they would start hating so I had to cop the mansion
So I can ride out, I can hide out
I can dip and dive out, check my wrist now
My wrist bling blow cost like fifty tho'
I jumped out the car and I smell like sour (diesel)
Smell like sour diesel, showing off for people
Haters-haters try to see me, flash the desert eagle
(Ride out) I had to slide out (Slide out)
Had to come through, pull the mouth out (Ice)
Grill, a-aquaberry stones
It's Blueberry Jones, Al Capone
Watch me work the wheel cause I'm [?] in steel
I can showcase skills from Antwon to Nashville
Still riding on crome
Half my body from Katy, Texas, other half on acres home
I did that, came through the rims peeled back
Got a hundred thousand stack
Gotta make my paper, gotta floss the navigator
Gotta cop a skyscraper, shake the equator, did that
It's the boy RiFF RAFF
Came through show my skills, I might work me a wheel
I'ma sign me a deal and then I tear that bitch up
Give a fuck ride buck troph-trophy truck, RiFF

[Verse 2: Dice Soho]
I might fuck your bitch in my Supreme boxers, So
The way I ball I probably could've played soccer
I got that foreign money on me
I got the foreign bitches on me too
I can not fall for no hoe
I just be chasing the dough, I put that on my crew
Fuck any model bitches by the twos
I dropped a band on my designer shoes
Getting some head from your main while I cruise
When you on top, I swear bitches gon' choose
Your shorty at the mansion she gettin' loose, somebody please go get her, yuh
Me and my niggas is hitter
Now it's time to get right back to the skrilla

[Verse 3: Trill Sammy]
It's Trill Sam, god damn I might cop me a Lamb
Bulletproof my sedan, my bitch keep a spray tan
Smoke like Snoop, jump out coupe, just might raise my roof
Ain't your diamonds see through, see through, see through
Raise my number like I raised my features
Fuck a teacher under bleachers for a new pair of speakers
Or a new pair of sneaker, bitch I'm rockin' J's
Bitch I'm catching plays
Chop blade like taper fade, damn

[Outro: RiFF RAFF]
So I can ride out, I can hide out
