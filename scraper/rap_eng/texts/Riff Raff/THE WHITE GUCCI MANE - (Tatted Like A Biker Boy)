[Verse 1:Riff Raff]
Taylor gotï»¿ me raisins
I been trapping back when Eddie Munsters parents telling ghost stories
Mi casa is 4 stories
Gorgeous hoes approach me on some happily ever after shit
Hyper active and attractive I'm trying to have a deep discussion
Girlfriends with kissing cousins shadow box on elevator
Upper cut on 7 buttons could've signed with Eddie Sutton

[Verse 2:Riff Raff]
Chose to be a lab physician pass out pills with no prescription
My emblem look like Sherell fisher suicide the citrus Phantom
Silk pajamas quick handle outside the Hamptons
Got you buying Gucci pampers
Even without the Tyson Chandler scandal
My sandals are perpendicular
Vehicular is particular
No extra testosterone attitudes get left at home
You see me tatted
