Theo Huxtable on the backside with the untuckable shirt
I come through, I show you what the turf is worth
I peel the surface from the earth's Nerf
That's the game field, playing field, Astro vision
I got a shirt with a bib up under it in case I wanna go deep sea grill fishing
That's when you barbecue at the bottom of the Costanza
Sandy floor ocean water
How you gonna breathe underwater with no sand in your paper?
