[Hook}
Body full of ice
Body full of ice
Mouth full of glaciers, body full of ice
Mouth full of glaciers, body full of ice
Cup full of ice and I'm gone for the night
I'm freeze dried, I'm freeze dried
Mouth full of glaciers, body full of ice
Cup full of ice and I'm gone for the night
I'm freeze dried, I'm freeze dried

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
I live the life of Fitzgerald, caviar apparel
I pull up in the Camaro the same color as bone marrow
Rap game Jack Sparrow, you can call me Captain Hook
And my life is a crystal ball like a science fiction book
Should I fly to East Iceland without a pilot license
I could have caught bronchitis but the windows were tinted slightly
Freeze dried frame, soaking up game, swinging in turning lanes, squatting low like a crane
Rap game Chevy Chase and of course the Chubby Checker
The wood like Black and Decker, trunk shake like salt and pepper
And the glaciers on my necklace got an Antarctican texture
And you should save your breath, don't disrespect me with a lecture
Don't disrespect me with a cheap chain, squatting in the turning lane, flights to East Spain
Just hopped off the plane, already fly high
Don't worry about my ice because it's freeze dried

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
Stay free, ocean stay clear
Her hair slightly wavy, negativity can't faze me
It's amazing, ever since I touched the pavement, I've been non-basic
While you're searching for acceptance, I'm trying to spin the world in the opposite direction
Subtle misconceptions, diamonds give reflections
Caused a car collision in the intersection
Hecklers get disrespected, phone disconnected
