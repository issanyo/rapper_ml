[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Young goon check me, drop my top
Strawberry orange smell like an apricot
Who me? I'm Eva Longoria
20K on my chest, my glasses by Tom Ford
Versace rocking chair on my front porch
Drop to my knees and I pray to the Lord
50 million and a new Porsche
I often get mistaken for Harrison Ford
[?] my lungs white
Me, I sip syrup in my Sprite
Yup I'm Ike Turner
Fruit punch with the caviar and a Swisher burning
Still get specific, damn

[Verse 2: Blacka Da Don]
I need my bands in advance
These are Margiela, not pants
Trappin' the metro housing building
Dodging the feds and the camps
I did not sell me no weed
I had to take me a chance
Putting the dope in a fiend's pipe
The residue see through the glass
She tryna slide in a coupe
They say my swag out the roof
I had my dope on a coupe
And a chain i got me through
That nigga ain't had a clue
I had my strap in the room
He tried to reach for my chain
Bang, bang, bang that came in two
I need my bands in advance, I need my bands in advance
I tell that bitch from the jump
[?]
I need my bands in advance god damn
Me and RiFF RAFF flexing
6ix side down to Texas
Countin' 50 bands
I ain't got no time for texting
