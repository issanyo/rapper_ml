[Intro]
Naw mean?
It got me tripping!
Fuck around, double cup
Slow your whole town down

[Hook]
Do-Do-Double cup
I done got 2 cups, filled 'em-filled 'em up
I done scooped 2-2 gallons, purple s-purple stuff
I done took over your town, finna run amok
Aww shit look who it is
Do-Do-Double cup
I done got 2-2 cups I filll-filled 'em up
I done scooped 2-2 gallons of pur-purple stuff
I done took over your town, 'bout run 'em up
I run 'em up know who it is, this that double cup

[Verse 1]
2 gallons of codeine man, I wish you would
I'm sippin' mud on a tuesday and I'm feeling good
You civilians movin' fast, I can slow you down
Enough syrup on my crown to slow your town down
I spilled purple on the ground, I grew pur-purple mountain
Purple panthers in my house, syrup water fountain (that codeine)
Don't gamble with the dealer, I'ma pharmacist
Purple rain on my diamonds, a-aquaberry fist
My rubby wrist glist when I wood wheel twist
I done got a mix formula with the quiet kiss
Aww shit look who it is, The Codeine Scientist
It's double cup, finna run 'em up

[Outro]
Yeah, you boys think you got somethin' in town
Shit, wait 'til I come around, I'ma slow your whole city down
Drippity drop, 1 drippity drop at a time
2 cups, double cups
I poured up some purple stuff
That's right
Pourin' purple stuff all over your city
Makin' everybody go to sleep
Go to sleep nap boys
You boys are screwed now
Double cup
Man, it's double cup
