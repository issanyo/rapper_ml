You know who I am
Just came out, already Rookie of the Year, what they expect?
You know who I am

DJA, Mad Decent

You know who I am
You know who I am
50k a week, doing adverbs, should have been a geek
Dropped out of school, when I sleep Versace sheets
Next week, and ? drop a new piece

You know who I am (okay okay okay okay) x4

Bitch, I'm poppin' pills x2

Syrup in my soda, might be blueberry
I can sing a hook like I'm kin Mariah Carey
Carry me two stories, never been a pharaoh (woah)
Cherriot the candy grill on a new Camaro
Lend me your ear, pretend it was me
Apparently, I crawl in 3D
Might be Versace, callin' Big Body
2014, got my new Nike Huarache
