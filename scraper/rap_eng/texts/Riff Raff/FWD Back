[Verse 1: Price Tag]
I remember bussin’ missions back when I was just a shawty (go)
Ran away from, home, was beggin’ Mumbles to record me (go)
Kept it G in all my raps so real niggas support me
Didn't hoop, and wasn’t on the field, but bitch I kept it sporty
Niggas wasn’t drinkin’ 40s, just 4 locos and we guzzle wine
I used to rock the table with the double line
Try to double my dollars, quarters and I need another dime
Nickels, pennies, quick fast, double time, I don't play with mine
Turn it, no cash is the only way to grind
(Gimme some, gimme some)
Nigga, we the California state of mind
(Gimme some, gimme some)
Stay to your business and I’m a stay to mine
(Gimme some, gimme some)
Cuz that’s the way that I was raised
Forward, back, and pick a way
State to state, got em knocked and to the base they leanin’
(Whip it, whip it, whip it) I’m swervin’
(Whip it, whip it, whip it) I got it goin’
(Whip it, whip it, whip it) I say, I say

[Verse 2: Oktane]
It used to be a dream to make yo mane bop
Now they want the no.1, they see I came starvin’
I ain’t got no time, girl, I’m trying to get to the top
‘Cause at the top they got a lot of guap
And with the guap, you can beat the cops, boy, I’m hot
I keep it real with my broadies, broadies stay real with me
I keep it 150 with women and that’s why they feelin’ me
Beemer butter on the seats, trade that, you might get the Jeep
I’m tellin’ y’all aflex, don’t too much get real as me
See, I pop out double kick flip, and that’s just for kicks
Go to my trunk and I switch kicks, now that’s for yo chick
I had the ? get that prescription and that’s for the zip
Then grab the citrus so I can spritz it and that’s for the whip
You know I smell like dank when I walk into the bank
Deposit withdraw some and use yo check to fill up my tank
My girl don’t want a club nigga, she want a BO dub nigga
The crowd goes wild, cuz well, the crowd is in love with em
Please move…

[Hook]
(Whip it, whip it, whip it) Real
(Whip it, whip it, whip it) Goddamn
(Whip it, whip it, whip it) Real
(Whip it, whip it, whip it) Yuh

(Verse 3 - RiFF RAFF)
Mainstream baller, shot call chemist
Single bullet viper with the werewolf finish
You ever seen a girl get naked at the dentist
She could barely holler, flourescent shot caller
Coulda been a scholar, but I chose to chase dollas
Young Jose, rap no gray
Thunderstorm Benz, can’t decide where to stay
Can’t decide where to live, homeless ass hustler
2.5 mill, flippin’ candy honey mustard
Oh, now we jack tellin’?! Used to be a felon
But I never got caught so I'm Versace yacht selling
Drop-top roller, syrup in my soda
Mr. Jodi High roller
