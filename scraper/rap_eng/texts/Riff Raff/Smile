[Intro: Parradox & Riff Raf]
I bought a Rolex
Parradox
I bought a roll- roll-
I bought a Rolex go go
Riff Raff
Talk to em'

[Chorus: Riff Raff]
Smoking top flight, money in a pile
I bought a Rolex just to see me smile
I bought a Rolex just to see me smile
I bought a Rolex just to see me (see me)
Smoking top flight, money in a pile
I bought a Rolex just to see me smile
I bought Rolex just to see me smile
I bought a Rolex just to see me

[Verse 1: Parradox]
Hold up Riff, 'fore ya snap let me hold that
This must be how it feels to have a bunch of stacks
I wouldn't know, I'm not that level yet
Just tryna reach the that ladder that you standing on
Everybody knows you
They all know Riff Raff and Jody Highroller
Don't know Parradox or The Scarecrow
I'm bout to ball, stacks stand taller than the Cleveland Cav's Lebron
I'll bet they all know who I am at the end of this song
Bout to tell the doubters, I'm bout to prove em' wrong
I'm bout to snap yeah I'm bout to ball
Bout to call em' all, redneck roll call
Ready to battle yeah we all stand tall
Bout to show em' all, bout to take it all
King of the south, my boys we ball
Bout to call em' all, redneck roll call
Ready to battle yeah we all stand tall
Bout to show em' all, bout to take it all
King of the south, my boys we ball
Hey yo Riff, sing it to em' (riff)

[Chorus: Riff Raff]
Smoking top flight, money in a pile
I bought a Rolex just to see me smile
I bought a Rolex just to see me smile
I bought a Rolex just to see me (see me)
Smoking top flight, money in a pile
I bought a Rolex just to see me smile
I bought Rolex just to see me smile
I bought a Rolex just to see me

[Outro: Parradox]
Bought a Rolex so for once I can smile
Bought a Rolex so for once I can smile
Looking in the mirror now I see myself smile
Bought a Rolex just to see me smile
