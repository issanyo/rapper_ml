[Intro]
Er'body tripping
Er'-Er'body tripping
Er'-Er'body tripping
Er'-Er'body tripping

[Chorus]
Er'body tripping
Er'body
Er'body tripping
Er'body
Er'body tripping
Still wood gripping
Windows slightly tinted
Syrup still sipping
Er'body tripping
Er'body
Er'body tripping
Er'body
Er'body tripping
Still wood gripping
Windows slightly tinted
Syrup still sipping

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Backwards down Maine
Coupe still dropping
I done fucked around and sang a hook like Janice Joplin
I pour codeine
I may be on my frosty
Should of played hockey
My teeth are blue, blocked em
I don't do mixtapes
Peach Panther dropping
I'mma ice berg, Scooby Doo pop locking
I can four wheeler
22 inches
Breaking boys off like a number two pencil
Waves on my head
Rims from Morocco
Me and Kane folding boys like some soft-shelled tacos

[Chorus]
Er'body tripping
Er'body
Er'body tripping
Er'body
Er'body tripping
Still wood gripping
Windows slightly tinted
Syrup still sipping
Er'body tripping
Er'body
Er'body tripping
Er'body
Er'body tripping
Still wood gripping
Windows slightly tinted
Syrup still sipping

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
House on swang
40-piece diamonds on [?]
I break ankles like hot sauce
Professor
Rainbow diamonds on my dresser
I done came down in a clk compressor
Tops down
Man I'm talking tops back
Laying haters on backs while my fifth relax
You ain't clean
Bitch, brush your teeth
You gonna get sued by Heinz
Tryna catch up to me
RIP

[Chorus]
Er'body tripping
Er'body
Er'body tripping
Er'body
Er'body tripping
Still wood gripping
Windows slightly tinted
Syrup still sipping
Er'body tripping
Er'body
Er'body tripping
Er'body
Er'body tripping
Still wood gripping
Windows slightly tinted
Syrup still sipping
