[Hook: RiFF RaFF]
Wednesday morning and I'm shopping, morning and I'm shopping
Losing ain't no option, Wednesday morning shopping
Wednesday morning and I'm shopping, morning and I'm shopping
Losing ain't no option, Wednesday morning shopping
Wednesday morning and I'm shopping, morning and I'm shopping
Losing ain't no option, Wednesday morning shopping
Wednesday morning and I'm shopping, morning and I'm shopping
Losing ain't no option, Wednesday morning shopping

[Verse 1: RiFF RaFF]
Hundred push ups 8 a.m
Diamonds jumping out the gym
Pass that pink bag MCM
Polar bear up under the chin
Frosted Flakes across my face
Teeth look like [?]
[?]
Balenciaga across my braid
Neon green or shark tooth
Next stop might be Cancun
Swing through like Babe Ruth
Chain hang like saber tooth
Everyday I need new shoes
I don't really fuck with that bluetooth
[?] prowling
[?] a thousand

[Hook: RiFF RaFF]
Wednesday morning and I'm shopping, morning and I'm shopping
Losing ain't no option, Wednesday morning shopping
Wednesday morning and I'm shopping, morning and I'm shopping
Losing ain't no option, Wednesday morning shopping
Wednesday morning and I'm shopping, morning and I'm shopping
Losing ain't no option, Wednesday morning shopping
Wednesday morning and I'm shopping, morning and I'm shopping
Losing ain't no option, Wednesday morning shopping

[Verse 2]
Wake up and get to that bread
[?] be dead
Spent 2K for these pants on my leg
Spent four hundred [?]
Wake up and get to [?]
Keep shit lit like a motherfucking candle
When I'm on South Beach I walk around in sandals
When I'm back home I walk around with hammer
You just gotta know we keeping it clean
Walk in your store and go straight to Supreme
Niggas be lying, it ain't what it seem
Yeah I fuck with that bitch I don't even dream

[Verse 3]
I woke to a number like the birthday boy
I woke up to some [?] bitches twerking for me
My [?] tryna shop I get that work in foreign
Bitch I'm a boss
I'm working with him, I'm not working for him
I went to sleep balling, woke up [?] in the morning
Hit the store right before closing
Doubled back right when it open
We see you be wearing that Gucci but nigga we know you be posing
I pull up in Lotus after you thought I was joking
All this game you should be soaking
Bitch got that wet, she be soaking
[?] be looking
Two hundred bands and I'm shopping, all of this shit that I'm copping
Supreme needs to go 'head and sponsor
I need the socks with the boxers
