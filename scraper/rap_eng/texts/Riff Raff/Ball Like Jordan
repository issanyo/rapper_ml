[Hook: Ghetty]
I could ball like Jordan
I could ball like Jordan
Ain’t about no money, then to me, that shit is boring
I could ball like Jordan
I could ball like Jordan
Ain’t about no money, then to me, that shit is boring
I could ball, I, I, could ball like Jordan
I could ball, I, I, could ball like Jordan
I could ball, I, I, could ball like Jordan
I could ball

[Verse 1: RiFF RaFF]
Clothes, clothes out the cleaners
Avery Johnson with the leaner
Rims twist like ballerinas
Versace, Misdemeanor
Hang-glide like Clyde Drex
Bench press like Van Ex
The cocaina is Tex-Mex
Stomp down like T-Rex
More adverbs than thesaurus
Cease Brontosaurus
OJ Simpson bought my Bronco
John Elway with the rocket launcher
It's the Versace head honcho, Riff
It's, it's, it's the Versace head honcho, Riff

[Hook: Ghetty]
I could ball like Jordan
I could ball like Jordan
Ain’t about no money, then to me, that shit is boring
I could ball like Jordan
I could ball like Jordan
Ain’t about no money, then to me, that shit is boring
I could ball, I, I, could ball like Jordan
I could ball, I, I, could ball like Jordan
I could ball, I, I, could ball like Jordan
I could ball

[Verse 2: Ghetty]
I could ball like pimpin'
I could ball like Jordan
You ain't talkin' digits, then you talkin' foreign
Me no comprehend, I don't need no friends
Counting up these bands, looking through Versace lens
I can chop blades, I can drop screams
Play ya like [?] swear more block than [?]
That's Elijah 1, dunk it on your mom
Cross em up and break em boys off like Lebron
Up early morning, scorin' while you snorin'
Way I bring the hit, you would have thought I was from Florida
[?] broke as hell home boy you out of order
I could ball like Michael Jordan in a fucking fourth quarter

[Hook: Ghetty]
I could ball like Jordan
I could ball like Jordan
Ain’t about no money, then to me, that shit is boring
I could ball like Jordan
I could ball like Jordan
Ain’t about no money, then to me, that shit is boring
I could ball, I, I, could ball like Jordan
I could ball, I, I, could ball like Jordan
I could ball, I, I, could ball like Jordan
I could ball
