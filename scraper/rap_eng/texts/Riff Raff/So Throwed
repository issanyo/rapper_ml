I'm so throwed, man I'm so throwed
I'm so throwed sipping on 4's

I'm so throwed, man I'm so throwed
I'm so throwed blowing on dro

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Popped a pill, rubbing wood wheels
Inked a deal eating lots of shrimp meals
Sausage veal, that's for breakfast
TV screens in my Lexus
Power Rangers in the head rest
Ron C, Houston Texas
Stack the paper fuck all that flexing
5 degrees that's in my necklace
Iced out, going hard
Bad bitches on my phone, roll call
Locking down the game like Mozart
Fuck a 9 to 5 I'll show start
Show stopper, trunk popper
Pour four in my Taaka
Cherry Vodka
Back in high school cocaine in my locker
If I wasn't wrecking shows, I would play for Knickerbocker
Pull up at the Opera, rocking Dockers
Fifth wheel drop and the trunk knocker
Why they acting like I ain't brought the rice and pasta
Pull up at the club in a helicopter
Riff Raff rap game phenomenon
Iced out my neck, wrist and arm
Froze up the bar at your college prom
Spent 8 grand on an octagon
