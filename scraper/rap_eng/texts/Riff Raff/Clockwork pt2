[Verse 1: cp the don]
Year 93 I was the aryan born kid morphed by morpheus
To an alien horseman from inhalin the toxins
Of arsenic in the most dangerous portions
Get crazy obnoxious, ruin more kids lives then parents divorcin
So bitch, fuk a bro fist ull get broke ribs and ur throat slit for talkin bogus
Most kids irrelevant like morse code is
Im achillies bro, your the trojans
Im diggin in the crates, bumpin grave diggaz
Makin great figures cause
My skill is unmatched cuz u dumfags come too short like 8 fingaz
No sticky doe, sheet the sticky doe from 9 to 54
Jus to make some shitty dough to afford that sticky icky dro oh

[Verse 2: cp the don]
Im spittin wicked frees on the sickest beats
Lyrically im a wilderbeast who feasts on weak emcees
And youll leave the scene with missin teeth
Slitten cheeks or 50 gs
Of force from a thunderbolt thatll leave u fukin blown straight to smitherines
Cuz I got more artillery then the us militry plus the mobs in sicily and the hidden bombs in the middle east
Kid I live the dream, roll like billy jean in a presidential limosine
So I cudnt give a wee bit of a fuk if ur little league midget team of silly queens
Ain't feelin me, rap game killing fields, style really clean but I stay more inces then hillbilly teens
Mm m get it straight cause gankaholics mixtape
Yo this shits great, and all you big name
Artists that spit fake really love the way the dick taste
And im in mid lane screamin fuk brs and fuk fags
Cuz I bust raps like my nut sack when it thrusts fast
Like a pump action gun blastin on a dum slags butt crack
But fuk dat, I still rock a hitler mustache
Still got my cock in ur sisters funbags
And these slum rats die quick when the gun blasts
Hunnid percent accuracy when my cum splashes on yur chicks cunt flaps
Basically im the dude thats winnin
I get stupid drinkin booze and gin and
Losin focus the room is spinnin
Beer goggles turnin these putrid bitches to the cutest women
Got me pukin shit in sum douchs kitchen
But I stay ruthless sinnin, killin innocent civilians
By the millions like christina u feelin it?
Oh now u a nervous wreck, think u deserve respect
Cause u poppin percocet leave u hurt and shred
I be wreckin with tecks but u can hate all that
I got weapons and sets to make an a-bomb blast
Ill connect with a left leave ya face all smashed
I come swingin in sessions like a baseball bat
I be givin u lessons tryna change yall cats
Cuz not for a sec am I impressed with the way yall rap
