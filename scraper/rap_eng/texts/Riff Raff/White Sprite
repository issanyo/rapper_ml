[Hook]
I pour a four in a white Sprite
My teeth shinin' like a flash light
I don't really think they like me
I don't really think they like me

I pour a four in a white Sprite
My TV shinin' like a flash light
I don't really think they like me
I don't really think they like me

[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah, nice ice
I'm 'bout to put you out of business, Service Merchandise
I'm smokin' dank, countin' bank in my army tank
You're pullin' pranks, I'm pullin' pumps like a gas tank
My diamonds frosted but Iâ€™m still rockin' tank tops
I'm crushin' rocks on black tops made by Reebok
Mary super stupid in the fossil benz (dinosaur)
Headed back to the country, rap game Huck Finn
