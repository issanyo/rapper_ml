[Verse 1: RiFF RaFF]
Split pea, pea coat
Right pinky ring glow
Cantaloupe clear coat
Root beer float ghost
Final, final chance in my Robin pants
Fucked up, lucks up
Last shot mascot
Phoenix Suns, Scottsdale
I broke blocks at Harvard, shook dice at Yale
Trying to keep my composure as I stretch the Rover
Attempt to stay sober with syrup in soda

[Hook: Tomi Dibiase]
If you wanna show me, baby don't worry
I know that I've been your girl
So good to be up in your world, baby
I've been holding on to you
I've been holding on to us too
I've been waiting a break [?]
Cause I need you here now
I hate when you leave me
I hate when you leave me
I hate when you leave me
Cause I need you here now
I hate when you leave me
I hate when you leave me
I hate when you leave me
Cause I need you here now

[Verse 2: RiFF RaFF]
Things get worser, picture perfect
Copy cats game purchase so I changed my verse up
Balling in Baghdad, Boston clam order stroganoff
Senseis at my castle light enough to hear a cobra cough
Swing the north, show the north
It's the butterscotch boss
Paid the cost to rock gloss with convertible hoss
Butterscotch baze for days
Slice the block like razor blade
Now you're balling with me, no more minimum wage

[Hook: Tomi Dibiase]
If you wanna show me, baby don't worry
I know that [?] your girl
So good to be up in your world, baby
I've been holding on to you
I've been holding on to us too
[?]
Cause I need you here now
I hate when you leave me
I hate when you leave me
I hate when you leave me
Cause I need you here now
I hate when you leave me
I hate when you leave me
I hate when you leave me
Cause I need you here now

[Bridge: Tomi Diabase]
Cause I need you here now
Cause I need you here now
Cause I need you here now
Cause I need you here now

[Hook: Tomi Dibiase]
I've been holding on to you
I've been holding on to us too
[?]
Cause I need you here now
I hate when you leave me
I hate when you leave me
I hate when you leave me
Cause I need you here now
I hate when you leave me
I hate when you leave me
I hate when you leave me
Cause I need you here now
