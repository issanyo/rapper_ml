Louis Vuitton lip gloss, wrist is soft
Tattoos around the pentagon
Octagon, eight arms
Blake Griffen with the Clippers gone
I'm bout to Edward scissor hands
I'll be damned if my kids go to public school (fuck that)
Eat fake food
Rap game Judge Judy with the rolex rubies (damn)
Hamburger meat for the athletes
I'm pistol Pete with the heat (swish)
Jump shot with the cross over
I jumped out geekin' out the Range Rover
Chain lookin' like a rainbow
Robin Jeans starks with the [?] flow
I never been a state pro
Floss mode, toss mode pull up Avacado
Catch em ? aisle at Costco, hit em with the cross bow
But I'm gluten free
