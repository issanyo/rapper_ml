See the way them diamonds shinin', see the way I'm leanin?
See the way them diamonds shinin', see the way I'm leanin?
See the way them diamonds shinin', see the way I'm leanin?
Ballin...see the way them 84's crawlin?

See the way them diamonds shinin', see the way I'm leanin?
See the way them diamonds shinin', see the way I'm leanin?
See the way them diamonds shinin', see the way I'm leanin?
Ballin...see the way them 84's crawlin?

[Verse 1]
Steppin' on the scene
Starched down clean
Mug on mean
And side-to-side like triple-beam
I'm breakin' these hoes off, from the land of the lost
Wood-wheel toss
They figured I was kin to Randy Moss
Did a show wit' Toni Braxton
Electric slide, like Michael Jackson
I pull up in the milky Benz
Leave 'em lactose intolerant
In case I can't get in, I'mma hang on the rim
With the glass in, its see-through like a skeleton
Hangin' out the coupe
Smellin like Joop!
Swing the block like Babe Ruth
Wit' ice glaciers on my tooth
Flippin' in Impalas, paint drippin' like enchiladas
Got beef like chicken nachos
And eat em up like tender tacos
Standin' on the podium
While sippin' on petroleum
Hoes feel my ice stolen, umm 84's I'm rollin' em
Haters I don't know, and some stack green like some deodorant
Leave you duck-taped and hog-tied like cattle at the rodeo
RiFF RAFF, uh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Flippin' up my phone
It's a Motorola
They figured I was bipolar
The way I sipped the syrup and soda
Hoes massage me to the roof, Marines trying to recruit
Cause I was bench-pressin' 250 in my polo boots
RiFF RAFF, Proceed to get paid
Can't play with minimum wage
Because...I'm afraid
I'm afraid to wake up on a bed that's not made outta diamonds
I'm afraid to pop my trunk and then the fifth dont start reclinin'
I'm stacked for the whole summer
In a stretch Hummer
My bank account resembles, umm...Bill Gates' phone number
Yellowbone with smooth vocals
Cause I left her grandma wit' bifocals
Later on at graduation, I permanently borrowed her PlayStation
Change grammar, RAP GAME MiCKEY MANTLE
I sleep wit' heated handles, like a candle in pajamas
Change topics, RAP GAME BERNARD HOPKiNS
If my whole body was wood...you STiLL couldn't knock me
RiFF RAFF
