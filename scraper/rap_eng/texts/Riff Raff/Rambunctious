[Verse 1: Beatking]
I pull up on the scene, smelling like a hashtag
Bitch I've got the lean, she gon' throw that ass back
Finna turn up on these niggas, I ain't got no fucking choice
"Can we come in with you?" I'll see what I can do, Stevie Wonder voice

[Hook: Beatking]
My niggas rambunctious, my niggas rambunctious
Get the fuck up out my face if you ain't talking 'bout money, hold up
My niggas rambunctious, my niggas rambunctious
Get the fuck up out my section if you ain't talking 'bout fucking, hold up
My niggas rambunctious, my people rambunctious, hold up
My niggas rambunctious, my people rambunctious, hold up
My niggas rambunctious, my people rambunctious
Hold up, hold up, hold up bitch
Hold up, hold up, hold up bitch

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
I come from a dark past
But guess what bitch, got a bright future
These hoes feeling freaky cause this work be going Kama Sutra
Vodka make me up power level
Smoking up; playing a pill
Used to hustle in shower shoes, until [?] like I've got my own show show
Kush got me on Igor
Smell just like the seashore
Shout to my niggas up in B-More
Made 20 racks off a detour
Interstate with them ounces, traffic stop my bond in the thousands
[?]
So much money I might need counselling
[?]
Drop it [?]
I was packing up out of town [?]
Trying to stack up for a Chevy
If you ain't talking 'bout money then you ain't talking 'bout nothing
Get the fuck up out my face, cause my niggas so rambunctious

[Hook]

[Verse 3: RiFF RAFF]
Drop-top Maserati when the wind blowing
Winter season coming soon, roll the windows down
Lean back, sipping lean, blowing smoke O's
Pockets-pockets overweight, Carl Winslow
Lifestyle rich and famous, diamond chains hanging
I can ball like Michael Jordan, I don't wear no Hanes
Pockets got more bands than the heavy metal
Midnight trapping in the forest like Hansel and Gretel
Secret slam syrup gave me codeine dreams
Computer hackers hacking, like Hakeem the Dream
I dream shake competition in your sub-division
Electric slide in the kitchen, like Ernest Givins
