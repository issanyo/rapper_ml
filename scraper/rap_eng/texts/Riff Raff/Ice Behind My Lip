[Intro: RiFF RAFF]
Drank, sip

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
RiFF do the most, thinkin' french toast
Flyin’ with the dragons, it's a codeine Aladdin
Heart cold, fifty grand below
Snow in my back pocket frozen like the North Pole, Pole
Runnin' coast to coast, coast
Rockin’ Gucci gold, gold
Lemon pepper rims, paint, paint by my hands
Landed, landed in Japan
Black and, black and white sand
I can eighty grand, ice, ice on my hand
Save the starfish, froze my whole fist
Number one ranked shipper in the tropics
It's the mister drank sipper, waves on my, waves on my
Like Atlantic Ocean, RiFF

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip

[Verse 2: Trapboy Freddy]
Lean with this ice on my lip
Four Hi-Tech, we ain't drinkin' no beer
Freddy hang on the train like a chandelier
Ride in the foreign, switchin' gears
Slow down lil' nigga, you almost made me spill Hi-Tech
Hold up, hold up
Drank, drank, sip, sip, I got them pints in the Cliff, Cliff
Bitch I'm from Texas, this drankin' a habit (Hold up)
We still be saucin’ and splashin’ (Sauce)
We turn a zip to some ashes
Sell you a cutie, no baggie, wow
One seventy-five get an ounce
These eight balls don't bounce
Sellin’ that work, Greyhound
Cell money, gained two pounds
Ten dollars, get five grams (Now)
Sippin' that drank, you can get it right now
Red goin' eighty an ounce
We get it and down it
I get the money and count it
Sippin' that drank out a Phantom
I heard the trapper be flossin’
Twenty teeth, all flawless
Say you ballin', then you bawlin'
Man these lil' niggas be lyin'
Bustin' a pack down in rhymes

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip

[Verse 3: Yowda]
Hi-Tech or that Tussionex
I don't drink Quali, I don't drink Fibs
Rolls Royce with a chauffeur in it
'Cause I get too high and I start to trip
I'm like, "Shut up, bitch," when she start to bitch
Fuck up my high, you gon' owe me somethin'
Yeah he brung bricks but I'm short on chips
You know I'm good for it, nigga, throw me somethin'
Got about four homies comin'
Everybody gon' want they own pint
I'ma get mine and go solo on it
You know Yowda Rey be on his own height
I ain't slept good in 'bout four nights
This shit here finna knock me out
My trap boomin', my raps groovin'
When I'm countin' up, you can't count me out
I used to hide the work in my granny house
Now I got a big mansion for it
Used to get 'em off middlemen
And now I'm plugged in, I need expansion for it
He bring 'em in, I'ma cash him for it
He out of state, I'ma tax him for it
Yowda Rey, why you shoot the nigga?
He was bitch made and he was askin' for it

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip

[Verse 4: CHXPO]
I'm the big bad wolf, you pussies just like Scooby Doo
Hood rich, I'm like Mike Vick, all this dog food
Fuck your mood, fuck your attitude, bitch you know I'm rude
Ridin' with this chopper, nigga, don't get chopped and screwed
I can feel the jealousy nigga, but ain't no testin' me
I had to pop that extra bean and I drunk some extra lean
Codeine and promethazine
I can't leave the country with this felony
I'm my best friend and my worst enemy
In the kitchen doin chemistry, I got that recipe
I caught up so fast, these niggas used to be ahead of me
But head 'em, dead 'em, tell my shooters go wet 'em
Don't you forget it, this ice in my mouth drippin'

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
Drank, sip, ice behind my lip
