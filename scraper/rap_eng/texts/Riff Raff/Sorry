Come up in that Rari, they be CG like my [?]

Took her for some collard greens yo ho don't say sorry
I’m a walking leach, birds singing like they’re Marvin
Hosted in the trap, brand new Aston Martin
Hundred round drums, hit the band, we’re marching!
Hustling everyday, young nigga, we ain’t starving
Make a play throwing bombs, Brett Farvein'

All I count is bands, all I see is racks

My seat spicy spouting red like chili bowl
I’mma throw some Spanish rice at a centerfold (she special)
I can ball like Troy Aikman at the Super Bowl
Nice ice, my ice brighter than a night light!
My night life let you understand why I can’t have no wife! (Damn!)
My trunk faint, automatic car crank

Go! Versace on my fangs cause I’m selling chicken fingers
I don’t talk to strangers, got guns like a Ranger
Pull up in that Audi thing look like a transformer
Drop the top and windows cuz my car got the seat warmers
You mad cause you boring
Broke, ain’t got no money
In the ville cooling Versace Paul Bunyan
Smoking on that onion
Your bitch ain’t worth nothing
Laughing with money
Taking trips across the country!

[Verse 5: Takeoff]
On my way to Costa Rica I just left for Argentina
Hurricane Katrina will somebody please call FEMA
My shirt it is silk and my sleeves is a cheetah
My top drop blunt hit a rhyme with a heater
I’ve been stunt so much, they call me Evil Knievel
Well respected in the hood like my momma was a reaper
Pull up in that Lotus Focus might mistake me for a creature
I done taught so many lessons they call me ol' Takeoff the Teacher
