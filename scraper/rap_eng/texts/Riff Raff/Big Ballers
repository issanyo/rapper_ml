[Intro]
Mike Chek

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
Big ballers, never change
Big diamonds in my ring
Big diamonds in my ring when I lane change
Big diamonds in my ring when I lane change
Big ballers, never change
Big diamonds in my ring
Big diamonds in my ring when I lane change
Big diamonds in my lane when I, when I

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Yeah I pull up like Hurricane Harvey
It's the white Steve Harvey, yeah
Ridin' around with my feet on the dash
I dropped out of school, I'm packin' the tool
I'm actin' a fool, I'm fresh out the package
My choppers are magnets, I mean they're attractive
Rappin' and cappin', these bitches ain't happy
I'm paper magician, I paid the competition
Coverage of GQ magazine subscription, you can subscribe
All you fuckin' bitches hating should die
I'm eatin' pumpkin pie in front of Lamb
I'm way up in Pakistan, dodgin' you trash cans (RiFF)
I need all my bands in advance, or send me a digital check
Ice cubes hangin' off my neck (RiFF)

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
Big ballers, never change
Big diamonds in my ring
Big diamonds in my ring when I lane change
Big diamonds in my ring when I lane change
Big ballers, never change
Big diamonds in my ring
Big diamonds in my ring when I lane change
Big diamonds in my lane when I, when I

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Big diamonds, solitaires (bustdown)
Twenty thousand a piece, bitch don't stare (uh-huh)
Spillin' Hi-Tech in the new McLaren (yessir)
Doors up on the bitch, you need to hop in here (bitch)
New foreign, switchin' lanes (foreign)
Ben Baller, new chain (it's Philthy ho)
Big Forgis on the Wraith when I lane change (Forgis)
All them niggas do is hate, they tryna maintain (broke nigga)
It's Philthy

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
Big ballers, never change
Big diamonds in my ring
Big diamonds in my ring when I lane change
Big diamonds in my ring when I lane change
Big ballers, never change
Big diamonds in my ring
Big diamonds in my ring when I lane change
Big diamonds in my lane when I, when I

[Verse 3: Dolla Bill Gates]
Wood, whip, twistin', diamonds (twistin')
So big man they fuckin' up your, vision (vision)
Twenty-sixes, man they fucked up my suspension ('spension)
But that's okay 'cause I get paper like subscriptions (paper)
Hold on man, you're lookin' too suspicious (hold up partner)
I paid her fifteen hundred, do my dishes (do my dishes)
If I pull up in the Maybach that's malicious (that's murder)
If I roll the window down you see bitches (right there)

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
Big ballers, never change
Big diamonds in my ring
Big diamonds in my ring when I lane change
Big diamonds in my ring when I lane change
Big ballers, never change
Big diamonds in my ring
Big diamonds in my ring when I lane change
Big diamonds in my lane when I, when I

[Outro: RiFF RAFF]
When I, when I, when I, when I, when I
When I, when I, when I, when I, when I
When I, when I, when I, when I, when I
When I, when I, when I, when I, when I
