[Verse]
Long as I do this, diamonds on my wrist
Used to relax a fifth, prior to draggin' a bumper kit
I don't need suggestions, fuck you and your advice
Rather syrup in my slice, Dracula blood over ice
RiFF RAFF ain't nothin' nice, my diamonds are polite
Nagasaki chain reflects off the moonlight
Only girls in my Jacuzz', my teeth Rubik's cubes
Aquaberry jewels, rap game Bob Cousy
Must got me confused, 'Saci berry moves
What you been doing lately, RiFF? Stayin' the fuck away from you
I need some Lonestar chicks, boysenberry bricks
JODY HiGHROLLER, Mister Syrup In My Soda
