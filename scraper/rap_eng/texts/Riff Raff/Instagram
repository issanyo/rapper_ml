Shout out to them bad hoes on Instagram straight flexing
On Instagram straight flexing, on Instagram straight flexing
Shout out to them bad hoes on Instagram straight flexing
On Instagram straight flexing, on Instagram straight flexing
Shout out to them bad hoes on Instagram straight flexing
On Instagram straight flexing, on Instagram straight flexing
Shout out to them bad hoes on Instagram straight flexing
Popped a Molly, I'm sweating (wooh)
Popped a Molly, I'm sweating (wooh)

[Verse 1: RiFF RaFF]
Checkerboard frames, checkerboard socks
Diamond destined on my watch playing hopscotch
Butterscotch bitches dancing in my candy mansion
Known for pants for my exes out of bandanna
You get kicked to the curb getting on my nerve
She had the nerve to tell me curb my attitude
She had the nerve to call me rude
She had the nerve to splurge on Saks Fifth Avenue
Find me rude then maybe you should reinvest
I reinvested in some jewels from my head and neck
I reinvested in a pool and a private jet
Dropped a [?] whore, I damn near broke my headrest
She needs some instructions and a makeover
Shit, I need my head washed; Head & Shoulders
Ruby red diamonds match your red dress
For you tired hoes, Versace bed-rest
I'm just trying to get iced up
She taking selfies trying to get her likes up
I pick you up in a gray Bentley, that's a great date
Both hands out the roof look like a birthday cake
