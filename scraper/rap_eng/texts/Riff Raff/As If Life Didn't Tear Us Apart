[Intro]
As if life wasn't (Mike Chek Music)
As if life didn't tear us apart
As if, didn't tear us apart
Uh, yeah, uh

[Chorus]
As if life didn't tear us apart
As if I didn't speak works of art
As if lies were just words from the start
As if ice didn't freeze up my heart
As if life didn't tear us apart
As if I didn't speak words of art
As if lies were just words from the start
As if ice didn't freeze up my heart

[Verse 1]
I was young once, could you believe
Not dime, just a mind full of dreams
They come around and they want everything
They come equipped with some tricks up the sleeves
Four million and it wasn't just a hook
Bought three houses and I wrote a book
Icy wrist and I should've been a cook
No handshakes for haters or the crooks

[Chorus]
As if life didn't tear us apart
As if I didn't speak words of art
As if lies were just words from the start
As if ice didn't freeze up my heart
As if life didn't tear us apart
As if I didn't speak words of art
As if lies were just words from the start
As if ice didn't freeze up my heart

[Chorus]
As if life didn't tear us apart
As if I didn't speak words of art
As if lies were just words from the start
As if ice didn't freeze up my heart
As if life didn't tear us apart
As if I didn't speak words of art
As if lies were just words from the start
As if ice didn't freeze up my heart
