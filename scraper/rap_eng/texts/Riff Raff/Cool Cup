[INTRO RiFF]
It's young RiFF, Young Kokayne Dawkinz
Young Kokayne Dawkinz
Change my name every three months on y'all bitches

[HOOK]
And my life and my ice like a cool cup
Cold hands, cold heart, cool cup
Gimme 75 mill i can heat it up (gimme money)
Igloo across my wrist like a cool cup
Ice like a cool cup
Bitch like a cool cup
And my ice and my life like a cool cup
Gimme 75m i can heat it up
Igloo across my wrist like a cool cup

[VERSE 1 RiFF]
Iced out, lights out on the highway
Automobile, snowmobile, might be a diamond ring
It's alotta ice out might need some cleets
It's just a Tuesday might only rock 10 rings
40 cuts in the chain looking like beef brisket
Time to take it out the oven
Like a turkey dinner
Might be a holiday
I'mma pull the bacon biscuit
Pockets got a lot of stuffing
Thanksgiving
Pork rinds on the seats
Razorblade the ounce
White girls on the couch
Girl scouts (cookies)
Slide couch to the cabinet time to count the onions
Work the wood like a lumberjack
Paul Bunyan (chop)
