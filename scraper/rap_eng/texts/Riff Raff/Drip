[Hook: Curtis Williams]
Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip
I want all the girls standing a the line for that bathroom
All the girls standing a the line for that bathroom
All the girls standing a the line for that bathroom
All the girls standing a the line for that bathroom

[Verse 1: Curtis Williams]
Drip, drippity drip, all she do is go sniff
Daddy got a lot money, ain't worry bout shit
Tell her lets smoke all, all she wanna do it blow
I said "Ok, to the bathroom we go"
Sniffed a whole gram and she did it like it's nothin'
Let Asha drive the Audi, got a young nigga stuntin'
Got an ex man, but the nigga so different
And she like [?], yeah this girl be trippin'
All she wanna do is party, she don't want no problems
Jace told you that the money kinda sound like a chopper
White, white
Got a nigga [?] up, trippin' all night

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
Should I pop pill?
Should I pop pill or should I cocaine?
Aquaberry rain, Columbian cocaine
Jody Highroller and Mike Will
What else would you expect? Versace house on the hill
Ice on the wrist, polar bear kiss
Hopped out the whip like my name sun kiss
Who's who, snorting cocaine
Yokohama flame, snorting coke in the turnin' lane
Cool cut frame, Aquaberry Jesse James
You can't cut lo mein
Hadouken, rap game Ryu
In the candy [?], sun rays touch the shoe
Give me baller berry flu
I got a couple friends that speak Hindu
Lets play a game, you don't know my name
Theres so much rice
Rap game Macho Man Randy Savage in the candy peach palace
I done did so much cocaine
Aw shit look who it is, its the white Rick James
I did so much cocaine
Aw shit look who it is, its the white Rick James
I did so much cocaine
Aw shit look who it is, its the white Rick James
I did so much cocaine
