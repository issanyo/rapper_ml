[Intro: Ghetty]
I'm leanin', I'm leanin' [x4]

[Hook: Ghetty]
Body went numb, I'm leanin', I'm leanin'
Codeine on my blunt, I'm leanin', I'm leanin'
Hydrocodone, I'm leanin, I'm leanin'
Four Styrofoam, I'm leanin, I'm leanin'
I done poured a four, I done poured a deuce
I done pour a four, I done poured a deuce
I done pour a four, I done poured a deuce
I done pour a four, I done poured a deuce

[Verse 1: Ghetty]
I done poured a four, I done poured a deuce
Keep my game tight even though I'm getting loose
Mixing with the juice, blowing Syracuse
Bad bitches on the Goose, got them taking parachutes
Christina got them geeked, I'm talking Dawson's Creek
Jacker's try to creep, but shit that was like last week
I'm back up on my grind, I'm back up on my hustle
Big trouble in little China, I come through like Kurt Russel
I'm flexing with no muscle, I come through like Jordan
I might be in Ralph Lauren, promethazine steady pourin'
I look to my left, leaned out my homeboy snoring
I'm looking at my clock, It's like six in the morning

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
Rolling through the light, watch me turn and lean
Diamonds dancing on my wrist like a ballerina
Might make a move, like I'm Bobby Fischer
I done speak my mind regardless if they listen
Drank in my hand like a fish fry
Yellow diamonds on my neck smell like a dandelion
I done started a Lamborghini with a screwdriver
Got me going back and forth like some windshield wipers
Wednesday night was cool, Friday night was better
Thursday night Ferrari, Tuesday drop top Jetta
Lemon berry tint, with the coat tails
Pour a four in my Pepsi, eating ox tails

[Hook]
