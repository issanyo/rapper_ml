Hopped up out the Sauna 🧖‍♂️
Blow a lot of marijuana
Rap game man Juwanna
And my green look like iguanas 🦎
What was that aroma
I’m the wolf 🐺 but not a loner
Smoking I’m the stoner
Bad bitch I wanna bone her
Hit it from the back
Check my reflection
Where the chrome was
Didn’t need the pussy
Head was perfect
Where her dome was
Then I started tripping
I remembered where my phone was
She don’t know my password
But I think that she might know it
She could have that fingerprint enlisted
I ain’t know that
Go back, act you like ain’t know that
I was paranoid but
Don’t you act like you ain’t know that
Then I got my flow back
Walked outside I felt so cold
I thought that we brought that snow back
I can wear some forces
So white you wanna snort that
Bad bitches love me
On my dick
And I ain’t force that
Swear my shit so potent
Niggas break it down and torch that
Watching where the storms at
I’m from where the worms 🐛 at
I can’t stand it when you never
Let me get my words back
You see me that’s for certain
And I’m still workin
Never clocked out
Punched in on my birthday
Pussy niggas irk me
Yo momma wanna jerk me
The bitch you fuckin
Always on my page and
She be lurking
Daddy know he searched me
Momma wanna slurp me
Everything sevens and elevens
Not slurpees
Gravy wit my Turkeys 🦃
Got you saying mercy
Funny how I’m water
But I am from where the dirt be
This is more life me
This is your life be
All that you ought to be
Naw I just gotta be
All that I gotta be
The way I piece some shit together
Feels like I hit the lottery
The way she mold up on my dick
Feels like she’s doing pottery
Rap game monopoly
Feet up, you ain’t knocking me
I’m still spitting bars
So no you ain’t knocking me
Let it alone me stopping me
That’s like me oppin me
No you ain’t locking me
