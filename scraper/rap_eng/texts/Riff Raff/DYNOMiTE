All i talk to is daimonds so when they se my car they holla i know mike that JJ from good times [4x]

[VERSE RIFF RAFF]

If i pop up make sure the dough is locked up
Cuz somebody in your bed then somebody get chopped up boys get stoped up
In the air **** disease in the morning im breaking the leace
Im brushing my teeth and burning the sheets
Im benna in the streets the streets is earn that is
Like damn who that is while doing a documentary on cribs
Its that boy riff making key moves
So dont get an attitude if i dont come thru
Some choose to lose others get abused
But dont get confused cuz im breaking all the rules
Maybe the ones thats golden pockets still swollen
Oughta drift out and did a song with kelly roland
Or tit old jackson or eric clapton
Oughta threewheelin' did a comercial with bow jackson
Verbal assacking thats what i accomplish
Oughta pour codeine on my cheese n steak omelet
