[Chorus]
Go and get your racks
And put your money where your mouth is
'Cause all my homies 'round me
Yeah, you know we really 'bout this
Go and get your racks
And put your money where your mouth is
'Cause all my partnas 'round me
Yeah, you know we really 'bout this
Bankroll so big, man it broke the rubber band
Hundred grand in my hand, gotta make 'em understand
Every time I pop a bottle, grab my hand and start to pray
I remember bein' broke just like it was yesterday

[Verse 1: Reese]
Swervin' on your set, I might slide up
Poppin' percocets like Jody Highroller
And I've been cakin' my currency in
Ate your money ten times over
Cuban link bracelet, I'm zoned out like a patient
Now I'm ten times colder, forreal
I'm cakin', all of these niggas be fakin'
So I'm ten times bolder
Ooh, stop and let me switch the topic
Benjis, they keep fallin' out my damn pocket
Livin' Kawasaki, chicken teriyaki
Fishin' for the bodies, it's all homi'
Please, please don't tell nobody
See me, might crash your party
TV in the damn Bugatti
VVs in all of our watches

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember bein' broke just like it was yesterday
I remember bein' broke just like it was yesterday

[Chorus]
Go and get your racks
And put your money where your mouth is
'Cause all my homies 'round me
Yeah, you know we really 'bout this
Go and get your racks
And put your money where your mouth is
'Cause all my partnas 'round me
Yeah, you know we really 'bout this
Bankroll so big, man it broke the rubber band
Hundred grand in my hand, gotta make 'em understand
Every time I pop a bottle, grab my hand and start to pray
I remember bein' broke just like it was yesterday

[Verse 2: RiFF Raff]
Yeah, Apollo Creed flavored diamonds
Kindergarten, I was trappin' [?]
[?] said fuck this couch
[?] in the trenches, I call a timeout
Rollin' through and it smell like strawberries
Ones in my pocket, I know the tooth fairy
Red dots on the watch and it might be the measles
40K, took my wrist out the deep freezer
Dipped out like Michael Strahan
Banana berry Lamb', trunk filled with contraband
House on the beach in the sand
Karate lessons backyard with Jackie Chan
Shrimp pad thai for brunch
Screens fall and I'm watchin' the Brady Bunch
RiFF

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember bein' broke just like it was yesterday
I remember bein' broke just like it was yesterday

[Chorus]
Go and get your racks
And put your money where your mouth is
'Cause all my homies 'round me
Yeah, you know we really 'bout this
Go and get your racks
And put your money where your mouth is
'Cause all my partnas 'round me
Yeah, you know we really 'bout this
Bankroll so big, man it broke the rubber band
Hundred grand in my hand, gotta make 'em understand
Every time I pop a bottle, grab my hand and start to pray
I remember bein' broke just like it was yesterday

[Verse 3: Hi-Rez]
I don't ever take a day off
Today I'm kickin' my feet up
Every single day, gotta pray, y'all
Sippin' that liquor and rollin' that weed up
I ain't got no time for your bad vibes
We do it like Rosie O'Donnell pant size
Got your girl wet like gettin' baptized
Eatin' these rappers just like it's snack time
Stress less, smile more
I'ma grind, no sleep 'til my eyes sore
If you ridin' for me then I'm ridin' for y'all
That's a bet, you can put that on mines, dawg
Call up my friends, tell 'em to slide
Watchin' cartoons, they gettin' high
We not that broke but we not that rich
We livin' life, just gettin' by
Feelin' low, feelin' down
Not thinkin' twice, take a shot of Crown
Homies rollin' loud but I paid for it
Workin' since my mama laid off
Money made me crazy, that's a tradeoff
Cops and lawyers gettin' paid off
All my friends said they have more
Important shit to do, they had to take off, Rez

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember bein' broke just like it was yesterday
I remember bein' broke just like it was yesterday

[Chorus]
Go and get your racks
And put your money where your mouth is
'Cause all my homies 'round me
Yeah, you know we really 'bout this
Go and get your racks
And put your money where your mouth is
'Cause all my partnas 'round me
Yeah, you know we really 'bout this
Bankroll so big, man it broke the rubber band
Hundred grand in my hand, gotta make 'em understand
Every time I pop a bottle, grab my hand and start to pray
I remember bein' broke just like it was yesterday

[Outro]
I remember bein' broke just like it was yesterday
I remember bein' broke just like it was yesterday
