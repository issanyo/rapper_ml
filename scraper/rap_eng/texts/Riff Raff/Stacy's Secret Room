[Hook]
Why you wanna do me like that
Why you wanna do me like that
Knowing I ain't nothing like him
Knowing I ain't nothing like them
Why you wanna, why you wanna do me like that

Why you wanna do me like that
Knowing I ain't nothing like you
Knowing damn well, I ain't nothing like you
Why you wanna do me like that
Why you wanna, why you wanna do me like that

[Verse 1]
Hopped out the Stevens, point blank with the paper
Werewolf, taper, full moon and the gates keeper
40 point diamonds and I'm stop train station
Haunted house basement with the ghost and the grape print
Muzzles off take it off the top with the sales speech
Pixie legs, legislation might be a ten's league
Might pull a hot sauce, might be Houdini
Don't worry about the locksmith, I'm used to pulling Houdini's
Used to pullin' models, all they want is fame and fortune
Egyptian queens, Sarah solar transportin'
Baking soda, female versions from Persian
Got them curves in the bikinis, T.V. screens and seaweed
Pirate ships and treasure, yeah I got that treasure
Might be rollin' in stores, got some bumper kids, fully equipped
Tabitha and Stacy, outside Macy's at the parade, I'm at the top
I got top, I got safe win, might be carryin' grape print
