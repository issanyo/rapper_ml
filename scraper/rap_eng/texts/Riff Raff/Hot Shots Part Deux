[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Aye yo
Sing with an accent
Portuguese
See me wiggle the Porsche keys
Grapes, crackers, gorgeous cheese
Shifting gears left handed at mighty morphin' speeds
She suck me off while I torch the weed
She throw the drug in her butt
She hasn't shit for days
She chill with dykes from the state right where the Mystic play
"You got a nice white dick"
That's what the sistas say
Hit the switch then I switch the lane
Dipped 66 in grey
Lines, lines laying on my shoulder
Olive, olive green loafs covering my toes up
Loud, cover my clothes with that five wagon coke
I'm doper than a salsa singer's nose
Smoke somethin'

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
Uh, Ruby Tuesday
Cinderella
Ballerina
Import important passports
Pasadena
Poppin' Fendi collars might be Berry Gordy
Pterodactyl dashboard
Seats, prehistoric
Dinosaur
Money cools the heart, but can't be too rude
Mind frame and attitude of a young Uncle Scrooge
You roody poo's get abused
Hulk Hogan
Ultimate Warrior
The eggs get boiled
Clash of the Titans
Conan the Destroyer
Turn tables with the young Clark Gable
Different mind fables
Syrup pours like maple
I'm watching cable
Plus my building marble housing structure
Prescription deductible
Rap game Dr.Huxtable

[Verse 3: Dana Coppafeel]
Check it
Yeah
I got that Kool Keith
That Ultramagnetic
Rhyme force like a lama spit
Electrifying
Just like a Blanka hit
They duckin' like the Gaza strip
No worries got it covered like Islamic chicks
I promise to body every beat
The hunger is bottomless
So peep game
But they fronted so you know that we can't follow it
It gets deep and you can tell the way
That she swallows dick
My brain is a lethal weapon
Tongue projects them hollow tips
The vision so vivid
Feeling like you might've lived it
But you didn't
You bit it the minute that we delivered it
Just admit it get the Medikit
Break it into two like subject and predicate
Coppa for president
