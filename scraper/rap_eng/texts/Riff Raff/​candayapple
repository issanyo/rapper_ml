[Intro: blackbear]
Yeah
​beartrap sound

[Chorus: blackbear]
I'ma pour up, sip that Houston, Texas with some soda
Candy Apple Faygo paint Mercedes
Flex on all my exes like, "Hey ladies, hey ladies"
Hey girl, what's up, I'ma pour this drink up with some soda
Candy Apple Faygo paint Mercedes
Flex on all my exes like, "Hey ladies"
Hey girl, what's up

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
What's up, can I get an ice cup?
Soda screwed up, the right stuff
Purple rain, love, I like mud
Big mo, po'd up, no scrub
I'm the president of the drank club
Pharmacist's line, want new plug
Dimepiece wanna rub my nut
Strapped with a rubber, no glove, no love
Take her to the bathtub, then undress
Pour codeine all over your chest
Let me confess, take you on a quest
On a life on the west and I come from Tex
Sippin' on a cup to relieve stress
When you're with me, it's always the best
I make all the rest seem like a pest
But there's only one Paul Wall I guess
Candy Apple Faygo
With a trade poll
Cost me about 4k pesos
​blackbear came through with a J-Lo
My day one, booty softer than Play-Doh
Lay low as I pour up slow
Stay true, I never fold
Game cold, that thing is swole
Don't mind me, I'm getting thrown

[Chorus: blackbear]
I'ma pour up, sip that Houston, Texas with some soda
Candy Apple Faygo paint Mercedes
Flex on all my exes like, "Hey ladies, hey ladies"
Hey girl, what's up, I'ma pour this drink up with some soda
Candy Apple Faygo paint Mercedes
Flex on all my exes like, "Hey ladies"
Hey girl, what's up

[Verse 2: blackbear]
I'ma show up, show up
Hypnotic with the Henny paint marauder
Call me daddy, you would think that bitch my daughter
She my accessory, you know that I'ma flaunt her
That bitch so bad that you would think that she a Jenner
Tell these hoes that I ain't really 'bout that drama
Got less money, got a count, it's just the counter
Look at the tags, how many lay down per bag
When I'm feelin' sad, I just start countin' my cash
Pocket and grab

[Chorus: blackbear]
I'ma pour up, sip that Houston, Texas with some soda
Candy Apple Faygo paint Mercedes
Flex on all my exes like, "Hey ladies, hey ladies"
Hey girl, what's up, I'ma pour this drink up with some soda
Candy Apple Faygo paint Mercedes
Flex on all my exes like, "Hey ladies"
Hey girl, what's up

[Verse 3: RiFF RAFF]
I don't know what they callin' for
Sippin' drank outside of Baltimore
Got me a house way out the Sugarland
Sippin' codeine, I forgot my plans
Purple stains over my Robin pants
Hand full of Jack, got me feeling like Billie Jean
I pour the four in the promethazine
Pull up on the scene with a crease in my jeans
There's a kid in matte back, MCM backpack
Sippin' codeine, I forgot my plans
There's a kid matte back, MCM backpack
Sippin' codeine, I forgot my plans
Purple stains over my Robin pants
Hand full of Jack, got me feeling like Billie Jean
I pour the four in the promethazine
Pull up on the scene with a crease in my jeans

[Chorus: blackbear]
I'ma pour up, sip that Houston, Texas with some soda
Candy Apple Faygo paint Mercedes
Flex on all my exes like, "Hey ladies, hey ladies"
Hey girl, what's up, I'ma pour this drink up with some soda
Candy Apple Faygo paint Mercedes
Flex on all my exes like, "Hey ladies"
Hey girl, what's up

[Outro: RiFF RAFF]
I don't know what they callin' for
Sippin' drink outside of Baltimore
Got me a house way out the Sugarland
Sippin' codeine, I forgot my plans
I don't know what they callin' for
Sippin' drink outside of Baltimore
Got me a house way out the Sugarland
Sippin' codeine, I forgot my plans
