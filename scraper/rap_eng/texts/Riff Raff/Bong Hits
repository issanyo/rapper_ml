[Intro: Dirt Nasty]
What was that? Alright
Aw yeah baby that's it
The world just got more worse
Cause me, Riff Raff, and Andy got a verse

[Verse: Andy Milonakis]
Your mom has no legs, her nickname is "No Legs"
Looked in the fridge and we got no eggs
Gotta go to the store, no homo
But I bought hella meat like mortadella
And prosciutto, and salami
I got you mami, I got you mami
Tell me what ya need and you won't get none of it
I'm a fuckin' star so you know I'm gonna son a bitch
Bang my chest out like a cracked out gorilla
Murdered that pussy like a real good thrilla
R.I.P. MJ, I be gettin' BJs
On the freeway, make it a three way
Got a sick water game call me Rick Voss
24 carat strings, sick floss
Lip gloss on my big cock
Your mom's a dumb bitch
And she lives in the wigwam

[Hook: Dirt Nasty] x4
Dirt, Riff Raff, and Milonakis
We runnin' through your pockets
For Xannys and Bong Hits

[Verse: Dirt Nasty]
Your Dad got no dick, his nickname is no dick
I'm in the water with your bitch like a porpoise
Of course it's dirt nasty baby
I was born in a Cadillac, dyin' in Merce-des
Ladies love my flow, babies eat cookie dough-nuts
Grown ups don't like my raps
But little kids do, that don't have a dad
I fuck moms in Winnebagos
Day-glow state shows in San Diego
Yayo get smoked and sniffed
So stay home, if you party like a bitch

[Hook] x4

[Verse: Riff Raff]
Pull up at the barber with the Supersonic Starter
I don't want your damn daughter she look like Steve Atwater
151 drinks smell like hand grenades
Diamonds on the face, wrist tastes like Steak Escape
Porridge on the side, silver Versace baby rattle
Freckles on the money, count 'em rap game Alfalfa
Whole house Persian I used to shop at Mervyn's
A word projected to go platinum, might go triple sterling
Slither past civilians in a brazilian caterpillar
Monotone conspiracy, the mammoth tusk cherokee
Induce labor during therapy in the Katy Perry cherry tree
In the Katy Perry cherry Tree

[Hook] x4
