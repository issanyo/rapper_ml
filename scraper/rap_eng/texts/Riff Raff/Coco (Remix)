[Verse: RiFF RAFF]
I'm in love with the coca
Got more hits than Sammy Sosa
Hard to lose my composure
Wake your block up like that Folger's
The Range Rover is cream but with copper tone
Ridin' on chrome, acres home
Two thousand on my hat, on my dome
Got more hits than the Astrodome
Got more hits than that Sammy Sosa
Mark McGwire, 250 in the Dayton wire
I swang the block like I'm Pete Samp
I'm on the green, Versace camper
RiFF RAFF is that HIGHROLLER
Syrup in my soda, chip on shoulder
Been po', flipped out in the Lambo
Gotta make my money fast, can't be slow
