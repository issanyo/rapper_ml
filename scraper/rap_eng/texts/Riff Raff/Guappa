[Prod. by Boaz van de Beatz]

[Pre-Hook]

My hair is turning grey
From chasing all this money
Every single day

[Hook]

Look momma, I'm chasing that
Guappa-da-papa-papa-pap
Guappa-da-papa-papa-pap
Guappa-da-papa-papa-pap

Momma, I'm chasing that
Guappa-da-papa-papa-pap
Guappa-da-papa-papa-pap
Guappa-da-papa-papa-pap

Look momma, I'm chasing that
Guappa-da-papa-papa-pap
Guappa-da-papa-papa-pap
Guappa-da-papa-papa-pap

Momma, I'm chasing that

[Verse: RiFF RAFF]

The coupe cool, but the roof clean
Way back in high school, I had a hoop-dream
The coupe roof Bentley coupe with the parachute
Bad bitch choosy, she bet her Daisy Dukes

Daisy colored corvette dandelion pet
Daffodil jet breaking bread it’s over here
Kobe Bryant is playing fetch with crocodile
I crack a smile 100,000 on a British top (dang)

My wardrobe Versace my shoes huarache
My TV’s Hachi Tachi thanks to my bank deposit
My wardrobe Versace my shoes huarache
My TV’s Hachi Tachi thanks to my bank deposit

My life my life my life my life's unfair
Chasing that guappa that paper

[Outro]

My hair is turning grey
From chasing all this money
Every single day
Look momma, I'm chasing that

[Verse: Mr. Polska (Unreleased Version)]
I got the shake with cinnamon in the air
She put it on the table love it how she does
I'm looking at the bartender raise my glass
Pull up stop it pull up drunk and make a mess
Jump on it we will light it in the street
I look forward from the beats
We go hard in defeat
I pull my pants down I throw my keys away
They call ? ? and they want me to stay
So I stay, to party from Monday to Monday
One day I've money to buy my own Mustang
Is it the cash? Yes it is
With your hands up please
(I got a beautiful penis)
