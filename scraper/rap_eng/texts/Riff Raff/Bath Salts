[Verse 1 - Riff Raff]

Black Versace shades in a black box
Now I'm on my cell phone, Chris Rock
Check the checklist with the ivory boxes
On the front page Orville Redenbacher
Red suitcase look like some tiger cubs
Look like vodka cranberry, tiger blood
Tropical winds twisting like a somersault
Could have played for the Colts, Marshall Faulk
Versace sweatpants, Swordfish
All this ice on my neck gave me a sore wrist
Pull up on a jumper, like Chauncey Riley
Now I'm on vacation, Gilligan's Island

[Verse 2 - Ghetty]

Here I go again
Rabbit she a 10
If she ain't going them I'm bout to smash her friend (woah)
Ill stay fitted and I'm all about my paper
Feel like Suave House, bitch I feel like Tony Draper
Ride real slow, and I might be with your main bitch
She know what my name is, and she think I'm famous
Pardon me while I lane switch
Pimp game straight dangerous
You no speaka no paper homie you no speaka my language
Trappin' to the maxim
Blowin' like relaxing
Whatsup girl you bustin' down
Lil mama tell me what's happenin'
Pockets fat, I been trappin'
Real shit no actin'
Left the game now I'm back in, like Wiz let's get it smackin'
