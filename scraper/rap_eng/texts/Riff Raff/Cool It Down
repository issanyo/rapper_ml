[Hook: Amber Coffman]
I know for sure I’ve had enough, yeah
I’ll run away to the sky, oh
I’m never coming down

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Tryna keep my cool, neck full of jewels
Been grinding twenty years like a damn fool
Everything I own I done worked for
No kids, no wife, no child support
You think this life is luck? No shortcuts
If I could I'd live my life inside a tour bus
I could remember being 19, nice dreams
Nightmares, crystal stares, they don't like me
Flashback '94 Honda Hatchback
Had to park three streets away from the club cause the windshield cracked
Fast forward, 'course I drive the black Porsche
Everything inside my closet I done paid for

[Bridge x2: Riff Raff]
You say that I'm not the one
That I can't stunt, that I didn't grind
Always wanna stop my shine, I ain't feeling fine
Need me a glass of wine, so I can cool it down

[Hook: Amber Coffman]

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
Yeah, glacier berry watch, got time froze
I done, I done shook dice with Pete Rose
Crew cut, top peeled back like a nice orange
I used to shoot jumpers with precise form
They wanna tell you what you can't do based on former facts
If I wanted to hear that bullshit I'd be in history class
If I'd have been around you five minutes I'd need a six pack
If I would've listened to your bitch ass I wouldn't be Riff Raff

[Bridge x2: Riff Raff]
