[Intro]
I passed you the ball and you broke my assist
I passed you the fucking ball and you broke my fucking assist

[Hook]
Broke my assist, passed you the ball and you broke
Passed you and you broke my assist
Passed you the ball and you broke
Diamonds on neck, I got rubies on wrist
I passed you the ball and you broke my assist
Passed you the ball and you broke
Passed you the ball and you broke, broke my assist
Diamonds on neck, I got rubies on wrist
I passed you the ball and you broke my assist
Broke, passed you the ball and you broke my assist
Diamonds on neck, I got rubies on wrist
I passed you the ball and you broke my assist
Passed you the ball and you broke
Passed you the ball and you broke

[Verse]
I got some ice from Alaska
I got some syrup Shasta
Federales harassin' me
I threw a brick off the balcony
I threw a brick off the balcony
I got some bitches from Denmark
I take her from Sweden to Venus
And they don't even speak English
I like to live off of vibe
You like to live off of lies
I like to be reincarnated
I was a king 9 times
I was a emperor of the Nether world
It's the turquoise turtle
I know it's hard to find purple
Passing that cup in a circle

[Hook]
Broke my assist, passed you the ball and you broke
Passed you and you broke my assist
Passed you the ball and you broke
Diamonds on neck, I got rubies on wrist
I passed you the ball and you broke my assist
Passed you the ball and you broke
Passed you the ball and you broke, broke my assist
Diamonds on neck, I got rubies on wrist
I passed you the ball and you broke my assist
Broke, passed you the ball and you broke my assist
Diamonds on neck, I got rubies on wrist
I passed you the ball and you broke my assist
Passed you the ball and you broke
Passed you the ball and you broke
