FROM SNIPPET

[Chorus]
Tip-toeing through the jewelry store
Christian Dior make draggin' to the floor
I don't really care about money anymore
Pay me in jewels while I'm pouring up a four
Tip-toeing through the jewelry store
Christian Dior make draggin' to the floor
I don't really care about money anymore
Pay me in jewels while I'm pouring up a four

[Verse]

[Chorus]
Tip-toeing through the jewelry store
Christian Dior make draggin' to the floor
I don't really care about money anymore
Pay me in jewels while I'm pouring up a four
Tip-toeing through the jewelry store
Christian Dior make draggin' to the floor
I don't really care about money anymore
Pay me in jewels while I'm pouring up a four
