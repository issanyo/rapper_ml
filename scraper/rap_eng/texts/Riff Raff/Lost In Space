[Intro]

[Verse 1: Dirt Nasty]
I'm lost in space
In an all grey space suit made by the Oakland A's
Hosted on asteroids
Hot box the helmet, getting blasted boy
Bone a martian in a glowing apartment
And she a cop for the robot department
Tell her ? to the rings of the moon
And get my dick sucked by a GX32
They designed for oral perfection
Cure a human erection in bout 30 seconds
I'm weightless, I shape shift naked
And turn into an alien Arabian Jamaican man

[Hook: Dirt Nasty & Andy Milonakis]
Lost in space, lost space
Your dad has copper teeth and plays the banjo with his dick
Lost in space, lost in space
Raviolis filled with Brillo pads huh
Lost in space, lost in space
Aliens with less than ten titties are worthless
Lost in space, lost in space
I got new cookie dough earrings, okay

[Verse 2: Andy Milonakis]
I fucked Mexican martians on Jupiter's moons
And Sky 63, that's a lot of space poon
At high noon, I'm high at noon in outer space
Fucked a Saturn bitch in her outer face
Now my dick is frozen like Pluto's ocean
Cause I fucked her warp speed with no lotion
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
It's the Milonakis rocket and it's on a mission
Zero G cum shots for these blood clot bitches
Drink my milky way and mind your business
The universe is expanding like my boner
I'm stranded up here, I'm a real space loner

[Hook]

[Verse 3: RiFF RAFF]
Yo, flying back to NASA bout to bank deposit
Arms hanging out the rocket, rap game Pippi Longstocking
Log cabin, matzo balls long johns
She dances naked to my songs, hot pink thong
Leave the price tag on the McLaren
The vocabulary, librarian, the green, vegetarian
My Wednesday nights are hysterical
The chopper ? carousel
The rims look like a ferris wheel
Used to skip school like Ferris Bueller
Now my day revolves around which color jewels
I choose for my Franck Muller, make a pit stop
My silhouette in the shadows, Alfred Hitchcock

[Hook]
