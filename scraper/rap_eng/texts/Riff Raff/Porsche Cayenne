You should drive a Porsche, Porsche Cayenne
Trappin' in Iran got me dodging trash cans x3

[Verse 1 - Riff Raff]
Blood thicker than water, fuck that
I know some prima donnas who'd kill their momma for that extra commas
Burner flex faster, syrup in the Shasta, makin' moves like plasma
Acres Home disaster, street sweep the set
Neon green jet, Bought a Glock and a Tec, invades my set
End up on the streets, hard like concrete, never been homeless
Ridin' with a chrome test
My Glock – Changed 'em
Diamonds rearranged 'em
Maybe we replace 'em. I'm a rolling stone
Riding on chrome past my home
I'mma stay stoned, fully grown
6 feet 3 with a Glock in the Jeep
I'mma make 'em ride 'em. Put it through my legs, got a burner in the K (Yuh, Make em Heat em, Wha)

[Verse 2 - B.A.R.S. Murre]
Porsche Cayenne. See me in ..... day you can catch a tan
Maybe an A say out with the fam
Fuck with them Philly boys, turn shit to Iran
Im Something like the man boys, worried that’s the brand
Got the streets going ham, posted up with the wham
Stay up on my grustle, do it from the muscle
I could teach you how to hustle keep it …. for the tustle
Learn from rocket when my turns done, diesel we could burn some
If your girl grown come tell her get a perm done
I'm with Riff Raff, and get splished splashed
Hit your…. With your rubber ducky in the Bath
Tub. Shower with them slugs
Shoulda showed love to a boss not a thug. Stupid
Torcher. The block is a scorcher
Hot like Lil Wayne, I'm peeling em Porshaaaaaa
