Track 1

[Verse 1]
I jump out the Phantom
With a cannon
I leave ya stranded at the Grand Canyon
Eight screens on
And I’m watching Ed O’Bannon
Ain’t no tryna tell 'em
Ain’t no tryna get a felon
Apparently
I’m more throwed than your parents
I come through with diamonds and carats
Transparent
It’s hard to see through ‘em
I coulda played for UCLA Bruins
But I was truant
I was school too late
Diamonds, aw man, cause earthquakes
I demonstrate
The way I demonstrate
Ice on my chest ice on my face
My teeth and grill shine clean
I’m Mr. Clean
I—I step up inside the club like Mr. T
So many ice up on my chest I look like rainwater
I pull up in the river they do rain dance
I’m brain stance
I sit up like a tricep
My-
I work out on my biceps
My tricycle made from Versace
But I ain’t got no kids
I forgot what I did
Five minutes ago
I shop at Texaco
I done
I done ball like Plexico
So much money on my plate
It’s hard to eat it
I come through
In a Gucci wifebeater
With the sleeves off
Cause you know I gotta keep it cool
I act a fool
I pack a mule
I pack a tool
They figured I done work at Home Depot
You shootin’ shots
Bitch I’m shootin’ free throws
I’m Grand Slam
I’m in the Trans Am
I’m flippin’ candy yams
These bitches look like uhh...

Track 2

Uhh Toucan Sam

[Talking: I switch the whole beat on bitches. What? What they want? They want a freestyle off the dome? Freestyle off the head? I po’ a fo’ in my Fanta]

[Verse 2]
I po’ a fo’ in my Fanta
I came through
I bought me a panda
It’s a hologram
I come through in Afghanistan
I stand still
And I raise my left hand
I tell a couple lies
But they just white lies
You know I ain’t gotta try
I freestyle drive-by
I do a freestyle
Don’t even give you a chance to come back
I drop the track
In about a minute flat
It’s nothin’ to me
Music ain’t shit
I do this shit so quick
They figured I work for Bisquick
They figured I work for Nestle’s quick
So may I mix it up
Eight screens on
Watchin’ Daffy Duck
I play in public
I play with my budget
Man I can’t fuck witchu
You ain’t got a good enough deductible
You ain’t got enough bank deposit
Mothafuckas tryin’ to negotiate my freestyle skills
I come through
Workin’ all kinds of wood and wheels
I pop a pill
I make a drug deal
I’m in Nashville
Yeah bitch I’m in Tennessee
Them hoes can’t see me
But look
But clear—for clarity
Just to see me
Twenty-five hundred
On the Cazal's
I come through
In Easter time I’m candy pastel
I pass well
Like Tony Delk
My chest passes is
Unsubtractable
You can’t even add it up with mathematics
In geometry
I pull up doin’ symmetry
I cut you in half
Turn you to a centipede
That’s how I do it
The whole game get ruined
I come through sip codeine fluid
But I—shawn derry awn
Uh sh-sherry awn
I carry on
I carry well
Carry bumper veil [?]
I might
Three wheel
Pop trunk
So hard
Leave your kid in a well
He down there tryna ask for
For pot roast
I ball the most
I eat French toast
Who gon’ cope with me?
Who gon’ go ahead be in the gym?
You wasn’t in the gym shootin’
Strokin’ threes
You can’t do it like this
The way I wood wheel twist
I got at least 40 grand on my wrist
That’s Versace
On my shoes
And I rock Huarache
I just got the damn
I finally got the Bordeaux sevens
I came through
I might shop at 7-Eleven
I might shop at
Mo’ fuckin’
Wal-Mart
Mexico
Ya’ll already know how I stop
I don’t stop
I ride non-stop
I’m still ridin’ spinners like it’s '05
That’s how I do it
I don’t even
I don’t even gotta make a whole fluid sentence
I speak a half sentence
Into a
Into a tran-transition
That you never heard before
I sip my syrup slow
You already know that I go toe to toe
With the best of ‘em
I got the best lungs
For smokin’
I’m all the way in East Oakland
I ain’t chokin’
I drink so much
Figured I was from Alaska
I ball on you bastards
Versace on the casket
Leave it closed
I put a nail in the coffin
I pop trunk often
I don’t gotta go to the doctor’s office
To even get my prescription
Wood wheel twistin'
I’m in a red light district
You know what I’m sayin’?
We givin' high-fives, handshakes, hugs
I come through
Still pancakes and drugs
They askin’ “what’s your subliminal?”
“Why you speak so much?”
“Is you typical?”
Hell naw
I’m faster than Quick Draw McGraw
Rap Game Tim McGraw
Better yet
Rap game Garth Brooks
I sing a hook
Like I’m Garth Brooks

Track 3

I’m in Pakistan
I’m in Thailand
Eight screens on 50 on my neck and hand
I’m with the Taliban
Nah that’s just just I’m sayin’
I come through I flip
Flippin’ on that candy sand
I came through
I leave the mic computer
The way I clutch a Glock
I clutch a Ruger
I did that
My (inaudible)
Sapphires on my tires
And them wheels peel back
But it’s still rewindin’
You already know
I gotta get my shine in
But my Breitling is timeless
My timepiece
I leave my pants with a crease
Leave your whole block deceased
But this ain’t no bleedin’ season
I floss for no reason
I eat, leave eight screens breathin’
“Whatchu mean?
Uh, your screens got a humanity to ‘em?
They got a pulse?
My screens even
Got a divorce
From each other?
So they had uh
Sexual relations?”
The way they hatin’
They figured I was never fraudulently skatin’
I skate down your street
With Jays on my feet
I eat a pepperoni piz-za
Rap game Mona Li-sa
I done switched my flow up
Eight screens on and your boy
Never been stuck
I got a big Glock tucked
Underneath my shirt
I know it hurt
I come through
More fresher than Certs
I leave the microphone alert
It’s a freestyle
“He’s so absurd. He’s absurd
He’s absurd. I give him my word
I give him my word
That boy got throws hoes adverbs and words
That boy came through in the mall
He straight splurged
He bought the whole mall.”
I came through
I’m six-two tall
Man I don’t want your gal
That bitch look like RuPaul
I come through with dope in my drawers
And I swallow my rocks
When the task force jump out
What the fuck they talkin’ bout
I’m on the pitcher’s mound
I serve 8-balls
Like I’m in the pool hall
Riff Raff came through
I balled on all y'all
They figured I ball for the Olympics
I’m in a whole 'nother
Dis-distinct
Your game is extinct
I’m a dinosaur
Uh-pass the thesaurus
I bet I done said every word in that bitch
Diamonds on my neck and wrist
When I wood wheel twist
I could take twenty grand off my wrist
But I’m still worth around eighty
Two million
That’s just on the Mercedes
This a McLaren
I pull up in the candy pear McLaren
Is it from Katy Perry?
Is it from
Ric Flair and them?
Is it from WWF
I do it by myself
“Man who you sign with?”
Muhfucka I got plaques on my shelf
I ain’t gotta sign with nobody
Rap game John Gotti
I drive a big body
Rap game Brad Daugherty
For the Cleveland
I shoulda been sleeveless
It’s hot in here
I need a A/C system
I don’t need your sister
Last thing you wanna hear is Riff Raff up in her ear
Man
Y'all boys feminine
You need to pass milk
I hate to ball again
I leave you on the sidewalk at Bennigan’s
They went to Denny’s again
They eatin’ a three piece
With some extra noodles
I just bought a Versace poodle
