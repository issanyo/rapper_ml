[Chorus]
Copped another foreign
Yesterday morning
Still, still tip toeing in my Jordans
Still, still tip toeing in my Jordans
Still, still tip toeing in my
Just copped a foreign
Yesterday morning
Still, still tip toeing in my Jordans
Still, still tip toeing in my Jordans
Still, still tip toeing in my

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Yeah, for goodness sakes
I might cop a wraith
House on a lake, just in case
I spent 2 plus
Fuck a tour bus
Driver tryna tell me that I smoke too much
Bitch you fired
Goons get hired
Versace Mike Meyers
Turning heads like a pliers
Reset my roster
She better speak proper
Coulda been a doctor
Ferragamo fiber optic
You reach, I teach
Respect my handles
German jack-o-lantern, with the burberry pattern
Swap or switch blades
Chop block like King Kade
I done poured an 8 in my grape gatorade

[Chorus]
Copped another foreign
Yesterday morning
Still, still tip toeing in my Jordans
Still, still tip toeing in my Jordans
Still, still tip toeing in my
Just copped a foreign
Yesterday morning
Still, still tip toeing in my Jordans
Still, still tip toeing in my Jordans
Still, still tip toeing in my

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Uncle Jxm
First class status
You mad average
Leaving outta Flight Club, got mad baggage
Bought 3 pairs of shoes, spent 5 thousand
Red carpet, best dressed, shout out my stylist
All this water on me it's a flood
Pretty girls see me, wanna fuck (they wanna fuck)
I'm tip toeing to the bank thinking
Should I get the Bentley or the Wraith

[Chorus]
Copped another foreign
Yesterday morning
Still, still tip toeing in my Jordans
Still, still tip toeing in my Jordans
Still, still tip toeing in my
Just copped a foreign
Yesterday morning
Still, still tip toeing in my Jordans
Still, still tip toeing in my Jordans
Still, still tip toeing in my

[Verse 3: RiFF RAFF]
Bought a house on Lake Superior
I'm banked in Wisconsin
Kicked outta 7th grade, cocaine on my tonsils
Went to school to see girls and dressed fly
I said I was sober
Lie detectors determined that was a lie
Used to pop lockers while y'all was at lunch
Used to hide the vodka in my green Hawaiian Punch
I wasn't too drunk, but I didn't pass
Got a F in math, for having sex in the back of the class
Backlash, I dropped out of school the next week
Fast forward, I'm making 50k, uh, every week
25k just to hear the jodie speak
Rubber band stretching like an athlete

[Chorus]
Copped another foreign
Yesterday morning
Still, still tip toeing in my Jordans
Still, still tip toeing in my Jordans
Still, still tip toeing in my
Just copped a foreign
Yesterday morning
Still, still tip toeing in my Jordans
Still, still tip toeing in my Jordans
Still, still tip toeing in my
