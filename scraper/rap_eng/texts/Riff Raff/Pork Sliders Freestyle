[Intro: RiFF RAFF]
Yo, they put the top up today, I don't feel like talking. [?]

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Top up, cause I don't feel like talking much
Slept on so much they thought I was a mattress
White Allen Ivy, mutherfuck a practice
Rock so much ice, I'm a hat trick
Candy cranberry on the cutlass
Ties black magic
I beg your pardon in an Aston Martin
Candycorned to Neiman Marcus
Before I park it, I spark one
Nah
I just passed your pardon
Matter fact I just crashed my Aston Martin
So I don't have to park it
You beefing on a Wednesday
I'm a vegetarian
Eating pork sliders on a Sunday
My Muslim homies roll the windows down
So they don't have to smell the aroma
Peep my persona
I paid for the gas
Shit, I paid for the Jag
Autographed the paper tag
You can have it back
A Uber car, I'm a superstar
I got cocaine on my door jam
Cocaine on my door jam
I just served eight grams in a traffic jam
I'm the chosen one
I roll a blunt and push 4 ounce of smoke into my lungs
'Sace lungs, I'll point it out
Smoke pouring out my mouth
I'm a fire dragon
Robbing, jeans sagging
I'm Bin Laden
I been had 'em
I been did that
I drive two cars, and both Cadillacs
My feet on the roof
