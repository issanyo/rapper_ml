Jody Highroller Dot Com
Jody Highroller Dot Com on my arm
Frost bit wrist with the iced out charm
Pull up in Milan and I set off car alarm
Pull up in Milan and I set off car alarm
Frost bit wrist with the iced out charm
Jody Highroller Dot Com on my arm
Jody Highroller Dot Com

[Verse 1: RiFF RaFF]
Earrings like Golden Grahams, Glacier Berry hands
Did Versace handstand on your Aunt Patty's Grand Am
Pontiac, I can triple coat it
Lexus was a golden glaze
1983 to 1995, that was the golden days
I'm allergic to minimum wage
Diamonds on my chest look like frozen grapes
They asked my doc, he said "I'm going through a frozen phase"
Get to my castle you gotta drive through a frozen gate
Yeah frozen emeralds on my lyrics smells like Bug Bunny's carrot
Tangerine diamonds look like Carrot Top
If I reveal the true me you'd probably call the cops

[Verse 2: Choo Jackson]
Ayy bitch it's [?] dot com
Know your baby momma, I could probably get your mom
If you see them diamonds ho, yeah I put 'em on
All these little rappers, yeah I put 'em on
Hop out the van, I hop out the van with grands
Bitch she on me, she wanna go through the dance
Forever cool nigga, them my only friends
[?] boys wasn't around when we was picking up cans
Tryna go get all the dollars, making these bad bitches hollar
Hey what's up
Need a white girl on my collar
I do not fuck with the Prada, you know you suck
Money is what I live for, money is what I live for
Niggas that hate on the low
But they can escape [?]
