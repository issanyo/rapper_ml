Call the cops, call the cops
Got mad motherfucking marijuana crops
Got lime trees and lemon trees
Got 20 dirty bitches down on their knees
Water, water, H2O
No big screens, no HBO
Tomato, tomato, potato, potato
These hoes just won the fat boy lotto
Hef, please let me use your grotto, hefty bitches is my motto
If you get on top, hooker, I think you might break my throttle
I'll knock your head off, you softer than a bitch's skin
You stupid bitches cannot win, fuck your wifey in the face
And then I'll take your next of kin, rented ten, I'll stick a dildo
In your fucking fish food, which dude's fish food
A rich dude's fish food, I got an iPad
IMac body and your mama sucks my dick when she's high on mollies...Mollies

Dirt Nasty and shit
This is agriculture
I grab a vulture
Who left that soda on the table?
Grab a coaster (Do that shit)
Girls wanna cuddle (Mhmm)
Yeah, they wanna snuggle (Come'er)
Aw, that's a cute teddy bear
Put it in your butt hole
Ooh what you know 'bout me, Dirt Nasty, bitch, I'm a farmer (Yeah)
Come through with a ugly ass ho, call her two-headed llama
She wanna sleep on me, better bring some pajamas (Good night)
I got a white boy Entourage, Johnny Drama

Ay, yo
Spandex (Spandex), I pull up with a lamb text
Too strudel, toaster strudel, ballin' on you poodles
Swish! Two cougars, 40 plus, clutching Rugers
Blackout the two seater, MC Hammer, have you seen her (seen her)
40 karats in the gallon
It's apparent, your parents, got 'em runnin' like mascara
Tempers flaring, I pull up in the Ric Flair McClaren
Four bad bitches on probation, are you sharing (are you sharing)
Got 'em jealous, 20 inches, all you fellas chop the tellers
Got 'em running over Jerome Bettis, Versace lettuce
No dieting, Gucci eyelids, I go to sleep, snobby pilots

I’m a farmer boy, goin' Scottie Pippen in Illinois
Teeth full of diamonds and corduroy, been a while since I was unemployed
I’m the real McCoy, not Hatfield
My RV got rims on 12 wheels, I ride to the club on a school of seals
Turtles and beluga whales, Escargot and a plate of snails
My farm grows broccoli and I get paid well
Only time will tell, armored like I just cracked the liberty bell
Gracin' on the cover of Mademoiselle, sicker than a sick guy with sickle cell
Andy Milonakis just went to jail
Drink a V8 in a V12 with three Fs smelling like Adele
