Glass on the toners
Ice? It's on a flash card
Flash Gordon,
Flamboyant, hot on boil
You like boys
I pull up in the boysenberry Benz
Hot way back when
You was hot way back when
Boys to Men
In the menopause
You wanna see the men?
And then you pause

I make a all time[?]
Snatch your body, family, mantelpiece
Pull up in the Mickey Mantle fleece
Wood wheel unleash
You standardized
I got under stand, capiche?
I pull up with the tires hot
They on fire
Cheeks: scorching hot
I pull up in the torch Benz
Pull up in the Wheels of Fortune
Rap game [?]
In the black Maybach
With no braids
Braided up? Yes
No snap back
Why they wanna stress me out?
Piece and chain re-lying on my chest
Now they want to spring test
Spring up toaster
Pull up in a drop top Testarossa
Glock out the holster
5 days out the week
My picture on your sister's poster

Black Amorosa[?]
It's a cold, cold world
It's a cold, cold world
Used to turn boys to girls
Now I pull up in the bowling ball swirl
I'm on bowling lanes
I got propane
I'm on fast flames
Fast track train
Uh! Fast track train
I'm in a Lamborghini
You in a fast track Amtrak

I live the life of a tampax
Tampon, go to sleep
Leave the lamps on
Leave the...
Leave the, leave the amp on
Speakers blown

Now you pull up with the equinox
Leave the Eclipse on
Leave the, leave the Mitsubishi
I pull up in Tahiti

I give you the heebie jeebies
Leave the trunk open
Leave the trunk, super-soak them
I went asleep:
Woke up, the beach was in Oakland

Open [?]
Open
Ocean win[?]
I got Ocean Spray
Pour a four inside a Taaka
Taaka vodka
You ain't liked a lot
You lookin' like a lobster
I pull up, you ball blockin'
