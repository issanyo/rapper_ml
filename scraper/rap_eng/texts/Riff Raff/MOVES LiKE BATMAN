[Hook]
Lucky I got moves like I'm Batman
Couple bank accounts in Afghanistan
Now I'm outside dodging trash cans
But lucky I got moves like I'm Batman
Lucky I got moves like I'm Batman
Couple bank accounts in Afghanistan
Now I'm outside dodging trash cans
But lucky I got moves like I'm Batman

[Verse]
Midnight flights through the foggy lights
The pilot Vanna White, shakin' dice over crushed ice
The white Sprite, side of sake, with electric eel
I done stashed four hundred thousand in the batmobile
Who's who? Who's callin' on my cellphones?
Hide my cellular device in the ancient ruins
I'm startin' to feel some real emotions as if I was  human
I used to work at McDonald's as a decoy
Park the Lambo in the drive through like them real boys
Big stacks, big watts, voltage power lines
Rap game Louis the light bulb sippin' Versace wine
A box wine skiiing lines in the box Porsche

[Hook]
Lucky I got moves like I'm Batman
Couple bank accounts in Afghanistan
Now I'm outside dodging trash cans
But lucky I got moves like I'm Batman
Lucky I got moves like I'm Batman
Couple bank accounts in Afghanistan
Now I'm outside dodging trash cans
But lucky I got moves like I'm Batman
