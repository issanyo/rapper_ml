[Intro]
Cause I'm goin' Hamilton, got trophies in the club [x4]

[Hook]
Got a fat ass, you need to drop that
A fat stack of ones, go 'head and drop that
Got a rubberband, you need to pop that
None of the above, you need to fall back [x2]

[Verse: RiFF RAFF]
Suckas wanna trip...
Cause I'm goin' Hamilton, got trophies in the club
Champagne champion, might buy a Panther - Rap Game Marilyn Manson
Celebratin' at the bar, (cheers!)...Ted Danson
White tiger front yard, neon mansion
Don't talk about my past-tense unless we goin' campin'
I can freestyle in Atlanta with Green Lantern
She put my hand in her back pocket like a bandana
Pop her on her ass, while she chewin' on bubblegum
Long Island Iced Tea filled up with Butter Rum
Brought my cup in the club, looked like motor oil
Bout to start ballin'...Rose Bowl

[Hook]
