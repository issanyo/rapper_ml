[Hook: Ryan The Kid]

I got that good good in my system
Riding 'round all night
Take it back to the basics
And your bitch cannot deny
Feel like money ain't no worry
But I'm so misunderstood
G's with ratchet hoes, get back to those
Cause I'm feeling like Tiger Woods
I'm feeling like Tiger Woods
I'm feeling like Tiger Woods
G's with ratchet hoes, get back to those
Cause I'm feeling like Tiger Woods

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]

Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Frozen femurs in the freezer, Jeffrey Dahmer
I can carry grams, West Bahamas
I can, I can move oil, Bin Laden Osama
Five thousand single in a salsa Benz
Nissan, Pizza Hut, hippopotamus lens
Rocks on my hands look like body boulders
Might change my government name, Jody Highroller
Try to cop my style I'mma tint the glass
Try to, try to cop my style I'mma bust your ass
Looking like a flounder, catfish
Laying down Oriental carpets, tempura shrimp wrist

[Verse 2: Ryan The Kid]

I'm a OJ sipper
Early in the morning like a cocaine sniffer
We up, black gang ripper
Getting this honey, my money looking way bigger, big dipper
Uh, I'm seeing all over the beat now
Goons in the street now
Running like a meet now
Creeping you talking get sleep na na
Me and B. Wash giving you the beat down
Rap game cheese and eggs
You can leave em over reason with a t-bone steak
M-m-me no play, no me no say
Cause if somebody starts ??? it's gonna be your day
And tell your bitch to back it up
Cause if she really want the money she can rack it up
Pop another molly, take a sip of that cup
Drop it to the ground, pick it back up
You know every day I'm out to get it
It's money over bitches if you're looking out to get it
I've never been a cynic and I've never been a critic
And yo girl, I ain't even been dependent
You know I got the snapback on
Bitch right here got the backpack on
Drank, pills, and my bitch for real
This life it got me saying

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B. Wash]

I'm with that MT? six pack, MT? six pack
Minute 'til 6 mack, hoes with the chit chat
Take your babysitters baby since I get my dick back
The ability, your versatility's a bitch
The wiz kid that didn't hit Amber Rose?
That came from a fifth and a bag of clothes
Honeys on the floor, I'm blowing half of those
You trying to get over the hump I'm on the camel toe
So talk it if you really don't do it
Don't cock it if you really won't pull it
I got gos that hold a couple millie for my crew
And got a posse full of players and a family full of goons
I'm known to keep mistresses interested
Lick on her dimples and drip on her timbles
And shake me? with clubs cause I kick it with friends
The only difference is I'm never missing
