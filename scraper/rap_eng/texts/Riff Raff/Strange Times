[Hook: Goody Grace]
Oh my god these are strange times
Seem like everybody only wanna waste time
Got a pretty girl on my mind but she ain't mine
I want her heart but she only wanna break mine yeah yeah
My god these are strange times
I've been hearin what they sayin through the grapevine
They can sit and wait around but Imma take mine
Yeah Imma take mine

[Verse 1: Goody Grace]
Since a kid I been livin off of my rules
Ain't a day I wasn't high back in high school
I was ridin with my homies tryna make it out
But now I've got it and I'm going crazy
They talkin but they scared to act
And I been walkin I been livin like I'm Kerouac
On the road I'm never home I don't know where it's at
Until I find it I'll be going crazy

[Hook]
Oh my god these are strange times
Seem like everybody only wanna waste time
Got a pretty girl on my mind but she ain't mine
I want her heart but she only wanna break mine yeah yeah
My god these are strange times
I've been hearin what they sayin through the grapevine
They can sit and wait around but Imma take mine
Yeah Imma take mine

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
I take mine but i don't take no shit
I dream up of a kid fully equipped
I'm rockin rubies it's the white Judge Judy
I should've been in a hundred movies
I'm Chris Farley, I'm Bob Marley
I smoke kush, red carpet kush
I did a hundred push ups, that was this morning
I stretch my money out like Jackie Joyner Kersee
It's the white Carl Lewis in a candy Buick
They already know in high school I was truant
I used to skip class riding on glass
Versace dream cast Riff

[Hook]
Oh my god these are strange times
Seem like everybody only wanna waste time
Got a pretty girl on my mind but she ain't mine
I want her heart but she only wanna break mine yeah yeah
My god these are strange times
I've been hearin what they sayin through the grapevine
They can sit and wait around but Imma take mine
Yeah Imma take mine
