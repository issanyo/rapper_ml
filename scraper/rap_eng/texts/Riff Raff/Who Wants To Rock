[Verse 1: RiFF RaFF]
S5-50, yup I'm the man
Cool blue jewels diamonds glistening on my hand
Who wants to stop, who wants to rock?
Who wants to pull up sideways at iHop
It's the Wolverine, starch in my jeans
Blueberry lean gave me codeine dreams
Friendly faces in my parking space
Walked in my palace with a sharp briefcase
Drop dead gorgeous, talking on my cordless
I can wreck a mic, I can sing a chorus
I can pull a stunt like Lamar Odom
I can smoke more green than a damn US Open
It's the white Serena Williams balling on civilians
Jody Highroller and my man Flux Pavillion
I can wreck a mic, I can wreck a mic
I can wreck a-I can wreck a mic
Who wants to rock?

[Hook]
Who wants to rock?
I can wreck a mic, I can wreck a mic
Wreck a mic
I can wreck a mic
Who wants to rock?
I can wreck a mic, I can wreck a mic
Wreck a mic
I can wreck a mic, I can wreck a mic
Wreck a mic
I can wreck a mic, I can wreck a mic
Wreck a mic
I can wreck a mic, I can wreck a mic
Wreck a mic
Who wants to rock?
Who wants to rock?
I can wreck a mic, I can wreck a mic
Wreck a mic

[Verse 2: RiFF RaFF]
Everything's gravy, driving Mercedes
Pop trunk of Taylor, let it out Katy
Used to play Sega, maybe John Madden
Crawl to the top on a Burberry ladder
Where's my Porsche? Okay I found her
Where's the keys to my Roll Royce?
It's the golden voice
Stroll through your prom with some 22 inch arms
It's the ruby red leather Versace Burberry pattern
It's a bad reaction, bumping Kid relaxing
Spit more fire than a butane dragon
Oh, I'm doing great, thanks for not asking
For you hating ass rappers, break you down like a fraction
Wouldn't let her touch me, she tried to free hug me
Oooh you lucky, where's Jody Husky?
I can wreck a mic, I can wreck a mic
I can wreck a-I can wreck a mic
Who wants to rock?


[Hook]
Who wants to rock?
I can wreck a mic, I can wreck a mic
Wreck a mic
I can wreck a mic
Who wants to rock?
I can wreck a mic, I can wreck a mic
Wreck a mic
I can wreck a mic, I can wreck a mic
Wreck a mic
I can wreck a mic, I can wreck a mic
Wreck a mic
I can wreck a mic, I can wreck a mic
Wreck a mic
Who wants to rock?
