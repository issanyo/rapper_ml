[Intro]
Ey RiFF RAFF pass my that old switcher house cd
I got screen talking 'bout lean, clap my hand two time to cut 'em high beam

[Hook]

[Verse 1 - RiFF RAFF]
Jean looks like concrete
Super soaked and stay flow
High sitashi bank row
Plus we know the gate code
Answer phone they let me in
Time is like 2 somethin’
Whip cream interior
The paint job is candy pumpkin
‘Fore I pull the cars out
Yes she took her bra off
‘Fore I pulled the charger out
Now she took her draws off
Let me in garage down
Turnin’ up the temperature down
Felt like she caught a fever
My ice like a freezer
Cold cold now yeah
Let me turn to jelly something
Orange juice try tell you somethin’
Put on top i'm barely nothing
(Yeah) I say i feel like crushed ice cube
Ice like a swimming pool was melted down
Coogi on my waistline
Shooting 3 shots from the baseline
System when I drive out
Sometimes I drive up
Doing 360 figured I was doing slam dunk
Sunny side the wrist watch
Wrist look like scrambled egg arithmetic
Park is out, lil moma daddies out
Lil moma look like a barbie doll
Lips out and and she used her to teeth to take my socks off (what)
Yes she took my socks off
Yeah the girl used her teeth to take my socks off

[Verse 2 - ?]
Yeah she took your socks off
She took yours sock
Tell her to put lipgloss on and come and make my cock soft
Beat my meat like hot sauce
Im horny like a trumpet
So many rings upon my hand gotta clean it with some comet
Gotta use the cleaner (coogi coogi cata leaner)
Just gave me a subpoena cause i was obtuse in the sprinklers
[?] when I slide
Candy fall off my ride
Representing south side
And you know I [?] wide

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - ?]
I’m the it’s like the buts mill
Full screens filled watching duck tale
Girl you can ride if you suck well
What a [?] like a must tell
Bus shells thug [?]
If he got beef like a lunch pill
Push the hell [?] a boy hatin’
Once he starts around your head like troy [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - ?]
My swag is so fresh
Clear VVS
The red’s chevrolet trunk banging like a set
And just to catch a glimpse girls dislocate their neck
And any track I catch like a drunk im gon’ wreck
So you can ask [?]
I’m flyer than a jet plane
Dripping candy stains
Cause my [?] coat is wet paint
Like I got a vet brain
I’m military minded
In the south is where you’ll find me with some real goons behind me
Making wrist blinded
[?] rewinded
TV’s screen shining
Im full time grinding
It’s the cold lou also known as cold blooded
Conversation worth millions cause the whole grill studded (ya dig)

[Verse 5 - ?]
Say I got 216 with the ass shakin’
While the 215 got the glass breaking
They be askin’ to come but don’t jack the jump
Cause we packed a pump like the gas station
I’m glass davies with the boy [?]
Holdin’ the grind [?]
Distorting the chain got the boy [?]
We controlin’ the game like [?]
I’m the boy SP
Number one (one)
Might catch me make the spun
Drop more mixtapes than anyone
Nigga like me roll with my handgun
High is the ransom that’s my family
You won’t see me unless they candy
Lookin’ good nigga fine and dandy
I’m blowing [?]

[Hook]

[Outro - RiFF RAFF]
Egg look like scrambled egg
Ice look like yolks
Egg egg look like scrambled egg
Ice look like yolks
Egg look like scrambled egg
Ice look like yolks
Egg look like scrambled egg
Ice look like yolks
