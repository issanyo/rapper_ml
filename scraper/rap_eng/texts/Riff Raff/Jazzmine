Jazzmine

Chorus: Jenvoix
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

Breakdown: The Visionary and The Architect
Riff Raff, street rat

Verse: Riff Raff
Yo, winter season just fell upon my shoulders
I just spent $20K on Glen Close posters
I just three-wheeled through Nacogdoches
When I rolled the window down, smokealidocious
Head shoulders, wash the Benz with head and shoulders
Last time I checked, syrup in my soda
Last time this year, parking lot doing donuts
Saw you a the fashion show, your style was atrocious

Chorus: Jenvoix
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

Breakdown: The Visionary and The Architect
Riff Raff, street rat

Verse: Riff Raff
Winter season, I’ll leave you freezing for no reason
Ford truck bumper but I just stepped on gas
Ford truck bumper but I just hit rewind
Last time I checked, codeine lemon-lime (Sprite)
I just filled up my trunk with the diesel (gas)
Opened up my attic, I see dead people
Nike box filled with narcotics
Flipped the big body, can’t ride Bugatti (too big)
Might Maserati but it really ain’t my flavor
(really ain’t my, really ain’t my, really ain’t my)

Repeat Chorus and breakdown
