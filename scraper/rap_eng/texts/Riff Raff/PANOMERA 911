[Hook: Riff Raff]
Now I'm driving porsche, Panamera 911
Porsche, Panamera 911
Now I'm driving porsche, Panamera 911
Porsche, Panamera 911
Now I'm driving porsche, Pan-Pan-Panamera 911
Porsche, Pan-Pan-Panamera 911
Porsche, Pan-Pan-Panamera 911
Porsche, Pan-Pan-Panamera 911

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Hopped out the Phantom, icy white teeth
Step outside, smell like Friday Thirteenth
I can bake a soda, but it's worth drapes
Skyscrape ape, it's a great day
Limes on the dime, ice like Clementine
Denver wine and dine, Rolex eastern time
My mind's designed for Purple Rain
Out and hit yo block like a hurricane
Soda cotton dropper, lemon berry lobster
I can pull a hamstring, soccer doctor
Law-jock creep, rap game grim reaper
Feed you fairy tales in my ???

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B.A.R.S. Murre]
Porsche, hotter than a scorcher
Ya boy's making money, Mr. Murray making more
Shots from the aurora, get down on the floor
Rap game Zora, you can tell by my aura
Want it kind of early, built kind of burly
Boys on the block with that Laverne and Shirley
Throw my shit too, pointing at yo boo
You can't figure why, c'mon, get a clue
Watch you on the ???, always get my floss on
Take you out the kitchen, and uh, turn the sauce on
Bounce to the whip, pop a clip when I'm ???
Tint twenty percent, like my tip, prick
