If you ain't like me before
You ain't goin like me now
I'm making money now
Pockets full of hundreds now

If you ain't like me before
You ain't goin like me now
Cuz I'm making money now

The world's got too many haters

Stop eyeballing me like you all all up in my shirt space
What's I even supposed be like in the first place
Love me or hate me I still got your attention
I'm your new principal I'll send you to detention
Chest like an Igloo
Earrings like an Ice House
Living room is spacious
Paul Mitchell facial
Wrist like a glacier
Arm like a spaceship
Eyes like a chinaman
Shoulda brought the rice out
40 points at half-time your coach should call a time out
Chop you up at half court your coach should pull your ass out
I am from outer space, something causes earth crater
And when she walks, it causes earth quake'eh
No need to be friendly, Cause the whole world my enemy
Rookie of the year it been me
Life is a chess game...
KING

If you ain't like me before
You ain't goin like me now
I'm making money now
Pockets full of hundreds now

If you ain't like me before
You ain't goin like me now
Cuz I'm making money now

The world's got too many haters
