[Verse 1: Rocky Luciano]
Hit the club with the Rollie on (flex)
Its time to plug out, Lonzo Ball (ballin')
Pull the draco out in a crowded mall (blastin')
Out of Houston ballin' like I'm Chris Paul (swish)
Blake Griffin, fuck Kathy Griffin
Fuckin' with the mob and have yo head missin' (gang gang gang)
If there's a witness I'ma light this place on fire
Fuck yo DJ, this beat is fire
You a pussy (pussy), you a liar
I cut yo head off put yo body in a dryer
First class baby I'm a frequently flyer
If you ain't first I look at you with no desire
You's a liar, but you feelin' me
When I was fourteen charged with a felony
[?] ain't gonna cuff a B

[Chorus: Rocky Luciano]
All white everything screamin' no ceilings
Rooftop pool party smokin' and chillin' (ballin')
Ya either get a 9-5 or turn to drug dealin' (trap trap trap trap)
Casey Anthony, I'm 'tryna make a killin'
All white everything screamin' no ceilings
Rooftop pool party smokin' and chillin' (ballin')
Ya either get a 9-5 or turn to drug dealin' (trap trap trap trap)
Casey Anthony, I'm 'tryna make a killin'

[Verse 2: Rocky Luciano]
9mm I keep it in the holster
I'ma sharp shooter snipe a raisin off yo shoulders
Your girlfriend told us you a fake you a poser
Smokin OG 'tryna keep my composure
'Tryna stay humble but my watch need exposure
But its Versace tees sittin' on these Robin jeans
Sellin' dope to all the fiends sitting there on easy street
Belt buckle got double G's, smoking on that tangerine
I keep hypnotic with Hennessy and I party hard like Charlie Sheen
I'm on protein and creatine I flex so hard like Wolverine (ballin')
Like the home team

[Chorus: Rocky Luciano]
All white everything screamin' no ceilings
Rooftop pool party smokin' and chillin' (ballin')
Ya either get a 9-5 or turn to drug dealin' (trap trap trap trap)
Casey Anthony, I'm 'tryna make a killin'
All white everything screamin' no ceilings
Rooftop pool party smokin' and chillin' (ballin')
Ya either get a 9-5 or turn to drug dealin' (trap trap trap trap)
Casey Anthony, I'm 'tryna make a killin'

[Verse 3: Riff Raff]
Ceiling fans, Jackie Chan
I done chopped blocks out on islands
One time for me two times for losers
I could've balled for the Hoosiers
Always better leave 'em then abuse 'em
Cause confusion, like Confucius
Seven screens drop watching Rick Rubin
Its a documentary, baller of the century
It was meant for me, but I didn't pass
Ridin on glass then Stacey dashed

[Chorus: Rocky Luciano]
All white everything screamin' no ceilings
Rooftop pool party smokin' and chillin' (ballin')
Ya either get a 9-5 or turn to drug dealin' (trap trap trap trap)
Casey Anthony, I'm 'tryna make a killin'
All white everything screamin' no ceilings
Rooftop pool party smokin' and chillin' (ballin')
Ya either get a 9-5 or turn to drug dealin' (trap trap trap trap)
Casey Anthony, I'm 'tryna make a killin'
