[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
It’s Pierce Brosnan, cross you up like Allen Ivey (what?)
It’s Allen Iverson, Versace rim with lemon tint
The lime Benz candy coated with the applesauce (sauce)
The apple gloss, I'm on a beach, David Hasselhoff (what?)
Hassle me I’m Tim McGraw, I don’t pass the ball (no)
Ball hard, fourth quarter, shoot the lights off
Fast break, three-on-one, I'll tear the basket off (get off)
Aw shit, look who it is the white Wesley Snipes
Rocky Byzantine, my attitude is Charlie Sheen
Walk around with more rice on me than a triple beam
The mansion, three-stories, living room with trampoline
Mi casa so big it took the maids the whole week to clean
I don’t like to drive Versace jeans in the limousine
 I could freestyle to a dolphin and a tambourine
The snow abominable laughin' inside my golden vault
The Candy Copper Helicopter when I’m playing golf (fore)

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I got bitches by the catalogue playing leapfrog
Butt-naked in the livin' room, look like Reese Witherspoon (Real fine classic bitch)
What's up? I’m bumping Dean Martin Christmas tunes
Every time I open up my email see another million (I’m rich)
That bitch wanna suck my dick then she better floss
Clean her teeth for a boss, Randy Moss
Diamonds on the cross, swear to God I'm a god though
I don't mean no blasphemy, Jesus eat at Applebee's
I'm with my bitch in the bed watching Game of Thrones
Waiting 'til Khaleesi's dragon's big enough to take control
Rich as Vince MacMahon, your bitch look like Triple H
Keep that pussy on lock, put it in a safe
All my chains on, flexing while I'm shootin' Vines
Hoes love me, watchin' all of them like a million times (replay on that ass)
I'm throwing money on your face, we forever paid
These hoes thirsty and I look like pink lemonade (lemonade)
Taste great (taste great) Grade A (grade A)
Grab your bitch take a vacay (in Bahamas)
Coming at these haters, A-K (that's the llama)
Ahhh, yeah, I got ya!
