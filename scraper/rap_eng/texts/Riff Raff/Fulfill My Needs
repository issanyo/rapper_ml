[Spoken intro]
Well it be the real niggas back with that hard street shit. Ay, fucking Boeystraat, man. Fucking N1994, man. Riff Raff, what’s good? Ay. But yo, on some real shit, the Mothers is one of the realest outfits out — no discussion. Ay, real recognize real, fuck an industry and fuck a scene — we’re in here!

[Verse 1: De Boeystraat]
Supplies from Ernesto, got my eyes green like pesto
Mano Fico manifesto, don’t step on my Nike Prestos
Or my Air Max 1’s, 95’s or 97's
Or the B-Dub’s or TN’s, might cop 'em 2-11's
Send you straight to heaven with the Scottish cashmere sweater
Even if you done well, Boeystraat did it better
Yeah, birds of a feather flock together
The legion stays steady strapped, heavily armed for whatever
Sad smileys appear; double dot, left parentheses
Haters getting mad cause they want us to end with this
Riff Raff and Boeystraat goin’ in, bruh, tag teamin' G's
Mano Fico got fucking stacks on deck with SODMG
Stuntin' on the world, man, I’m something like an acrobat
Adobe illustrate ghetto pop, no need for photoshop
Never gonna flop, fucking showstop, bass gon' drop
Unstoppable — we’re the Mothers, who these hoes gon' stop? Huh?

[Hook] (x2)
The love who’ll stay for eternity
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs
But when I turn around-round, but when I turn around-round...


[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
Suckas wanna play me, think I'm public housing
Saved by The Bell - Kelly Kapowski
Rap game Zack Morris in the black Ford Taurus
Vocabulary not affordable, more adjectives than a thesaurus
Dinosaur print touches pterodactyl
Teriyaki seats kiss the wounded falcons
Hyper-color bases playing freeze tag
Flew around the moon in the melon Jag
Canteloupe shades, frames made by Troy Aikman
Could have played for Texas Rangers - Julio Franco (baseball)
Big banking embargo, my dad Wells Fargo
Backyard unloading cargo - Murciélago

[Hook] (x2)
