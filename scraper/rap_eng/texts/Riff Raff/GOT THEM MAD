Doin a lil stuntin (got em mad, got em mad)
Doin a lil somethin (got em mad, got em mad)

[Hook]
Now they mad cause I'm doin a lil somethin
Now they mad cause I'm doin a lil somethin
Came from nowhere
I mean I came from nowhere, nowhere

Yo
Got my rims from Afghanistan
Bout to wrap it up, Pakistan
Might jump ship with 400 grand
I can cop some ice, avalanche
And I should have brought the rice out
Jody Highroller, finna pull the dice out
I can sneeze, I can change the breeze to winter season
Wintergreen lime slime looks like Slimer sleepin
And I work the wood like a log cabin
All this rice I brought I should have bought a china cabinet
Bob and weave, I can breathe in the Florida Keys
I might go on vacation, palm trees

[Hook]
