[Intro: RiFF RAFF]
Uh, yeah, and my wrist frosty
Don't ask what it cost me
Yeah my wrist frosty
But don't ask what it cost me

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
Wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
My wrist frosty, wrist frosty
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
Wrist frosty, what it cost me
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me

[Verse 1: Dice Soho]
Wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
My bitch bossy and her lips glossy, yeah
Too much Goose, haters wanna off me
Too much ice, diamonds brown like coffee, hey
These niggas don't know what I been through
I can fuck my bitch with my other bitch, ooh, ayy
Hoes in the Sprinter, hoes pull up by the crew, ayy
Touch so many hundreds that my body turnin' blue, hey
Drive so many whips, I can't find a Bentley coupe, ayy
Keep them shottas with me and they all ready to shoot
Rollie full of snow, damn I got a frostbite
I'm so high, for goddamn near lost sight

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
Wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
My wrist frosty, wrist frosty
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
Wrist frosty, what it cost me
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me

[Verse 2: Poodeezy]
My wrist frosty but I'm rockin' plain jane
I know who got the yola but I cannot name names
You can fuck my bitch 'long as she ain't my main thing
And if you fuck my bitch just know she wasn't my main thing
I pull up in that Beamer, comin' down the main swing
Call me Deezy, call me daddy, it's the same thing
Wrist on glisten, diamonds hittin' when I change lanes
And I just got that fresh manicure from Pang Lang
Diamonds real up in the field, ho I know you know
You tryna chill but won't reveal the ho, I know you don't
This ain't cookies in my wood, this shit here do-si-do
He talkin' 'bout he really real, you gotta show me so

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
Wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
My wrist frosty, wrist frosty
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
Wrist frosty, what it cost me
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me

[Verse 3: RiFF RAFF]
Big boss move, came with a cost too
Back in law school, chain look like carpool
Big Bentley truck, baller of the century
Ain't no meant to be, do what I had to do
Ain't no attitude, ain't got no attitude
Fuck subtraction fool, fallin' all the way to heaven
Ballin' like Kevin, I'm Kevin Garnett
'Cept I don't break a sweat, I'm tearin' up the nest
Ain't from New Jersey, ballin' with the Hersheys
I can Hershey Hawkins, I can Darryl Dawkins
I can Chocolate Thunder, I can Royal Rumble
Do what I had to do, I'm ballin' on these dudes

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
Wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
My wrist frosty, wrist frosty
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
Wrist frosty, what it cost me
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me
My wrist frosty, don't ask what it cost me

[Outro: RiFF RAFF]
Uh, yeah, and my wrist frosty
Don't ask what it cost me
Yeah my wrist frosty
But don't ask what it cost me
