Give me my Merlot
My pinot Gringio
Give me my Chandon
We mix that alcohol

Don't need no 12 steps
Shots all night, all night
DGAF and no regrets
Happy hour starts at five
You think I'm staring at ya
Like imma take you home
My heart belongs to one man
Mr. Cuervo

[Bridge 1]
Give me my Morgan
I need my Belvedere
Another Jack & Coke
We like that alcohol

[Hook]
Pop that bub
'Cause you know them drinks on me
We killin' these shots like R.I.P
We're wasted & we ain't going ho-o-ome

Fill your cup
'Cause you know them drinks on me
We countin' these stacks like 1 2 3
My paper be over flowing
O-o-o

[Bridge 2]
Give me that Andre
4LOKO errrday
Give me that UV
Cheap alcohol please

[RiFF RAFF]
10 shots, let's just start the night
Better brain, need what I like
I raise my glass like fahrenheit
Chest smell like Farrah Fawcett
Lemon ring in the neon gimlet
Kobe Bryant, at the bar in Boston
Tequila shots off a blonde barbie

[Bridge 3]
Give me my Bailey's
I need my Jager Bombs
Give me that Sake
We like that alcohol

[Hook]
Pop that bub
'Cause you know them drinks on me
We killin' these shots like R.I.P
We're wasted & we ain't going ho-o-ome

Fill your cup
'Cause you know them drinks on me
We countin' these stacks like 1 2 3
My paper be over flowing
O-O-O

We like that, we mix that alcohol

[Bridge 4]
Give me my Merlot
My Pinot Gringio
Give me my Chandon
We mix that alcohol

Give me my Bailey's
I need my Jager Bombs
Give me that Sake
We mix that alcohol

Pop that bub
'Cause you know them drinks on me
We killin' these shots like R.I.P
We're wasted & we ain't going ho-o-ome

[Hook]
Fill your cup
'Cause you know them drinks on me
We countin' these stacks like 1 2 3
My paper be over flowing
O-O-O

My paper be overflowin'
My paper be overflowin'
My paper be overflowin'
