[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
Cut the lights out, let the ice glow
Fifty show, fuck a hundred hoes
White gold, Louie Gucci
Stupid groupies, live my life a movie
Bad bitches, money rolls
Hundred bands, hundred hoes
Bad bitches, money rolls
Hundred bands, hundred hoes

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
White (?), ice burger fist
Thirty grand, on my neck and wrist
They wanna see my charm, it's a Lucky Charm
I put my wrist and arm, my wrist filet mignon
Won a hundred thousand, that's a hundred K
Met me at the corner store, I'm riding grey
My style is retro
Used to shop at Texaco, balling all the way out in Mexico
We Mexico, fifty grand a better, liquor sweater
I only sip (?)
RiFF RAFF a top dawg, ball hard
RiFF RAFF, Fat Trel, we gon' whip the lot

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
Cut the lights out, let the ice glow
Fifty show, fuck a hundred hoes

Stupid groupies, live my life a movie
Bad bitches, money rolls
Hundred bands, hundred hoes
Bad bitches, money rolls
Hundred bands, hundred hoes

[Verse 2: Fat Trel]
A hundred bands, hundred shows
Bodies with a hundred hoes
Make it so fold
And they say I got a old soul
Steak and shrimp and chicken then I remember (?)
Selling weed and selling coke
Flexing like the Texaco
Cali dope, Cali hoe
California Calicoes
Bad bitches, money rolls
Make me let my Tommy go
Louie Gucci, white gold
Pussy by the (?)
All I want for Christmas is some bitches licking pussy hole
Tell me where my liquor go
Molly, dope and Swishers go
H Town, hoe strong
Twelve hundred, (?)
Tell me where my liquor go
Molly, dope and Swishers go
H Town, hoe strong
Twelve hundred, (?)
Cash

[Verse 3: Chaboki]
Fifty-Fifty bands, fif-fifty hoes
Fifty pints, it's fifty for a show
I'm hitting hella licks, I need designer clothes
I re-up then I sell out, that's just how it goes
My money long, and my weed strong
No (?) flow, homie you a peon
Hi-Tech, only thing I fiend off
Fuck around with the gang, I flick the bean on
Stash box, designer stash box
I've been living good, I'm not no half knot
Cash drops, right after cash drops
I been moving work all in the trap house

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
Cut the lights out, let the ice glow

Stupid groupies, live my life a movie
Bad bitches, money rolls
Hundred bands, hundred hoes
Bad bitches, money rolls
