[Intro]
It's called time people and
If you don't slow down and
Realize what you're doing
You might lose everything

[Hook]
Cause time goes by
It goes on
And it don't stop
I said time goes by
It goes on
And it don't stop

[VERSE 1]
Sometimes I feel, feel like my time has passed
Like I'm an hourglass, and the sand is moving fast (moving too fast)
In this life I live, my dad is my best friend
But it seems like I never call him, unless I need some money
The people around me, I mean the ones that I do have
It's like they're here today, they'll probably be gone tomorrow
When its raining hard, and my car breaks down
I got no one to call on, except triple-A

[Hook]

[VERSE 2]
Here we go again, in my life all alone again
I got no wife, I got no kids
No one to come home to, no one to cook for me
And when I'm sick, its a catastrophe
My days are slow, and my nights are cold
And to go to sleep I gotta keep the TV on (love my TV on)
My ex still calls me up, she asks if im doing fine
But she has a daughter (how am I gonna be fine?)
And the baby ain't mine

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Do all my time up on this earth they told what I couldn't make (what I couldn't make)
And I gotta put it in their face (put it in their face)
Was all my grind just a waste of time?
I think that they're hearing me, but they don't wanna really deal with me
Through all these years, from what I've seen
I've had friends steal from me, the same ones who lived with me
When I got grown and dropped out of school
Nobody was broke with me, but now they all wanna roll with me

[Hook]
