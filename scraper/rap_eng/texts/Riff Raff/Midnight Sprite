[Hook]
I pour a four in a white Sprite
My teeth shinin' like a flash light
I don't really think they like me
I don't really think they like me

I pour a four in a white Sprite
My teeth shinin' like a flash light
I don't really think they like me
I don't really think they like me

[Verse 1]
Jeah, Riff, nice ice
I'm 'bout to punch you out of business, service merchandise
I'm smokin' dank, countin' bank in my army tank
You're pullin' pranks, I'm pullin' pumps like a gas tank
Diamonds frosted but I'm still rockin' tank tops
I'm crushin' rocks on black tops made by Reebok
Now I'm super stupid in the fossil benz (dinosaur)
Headed back to the country, rap game Huckle Finn

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Clean out the gym like Marcus Camby
Eight dice shake and my stacks come in handy
7 on my wrist my ice Toucan Sammy
Left with the whammy came back with the Grammy
Streetsweeper legal, avocado bandana
Ice out wall to candy banana
Chip on my shoulder, Jody Highroller
Drove through the ocean
Four leaf clover Range Rover
