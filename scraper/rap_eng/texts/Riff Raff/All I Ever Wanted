[Intro]
Yeah, Ah
All I ever wanted
Ah
All I ever wanted
Ah
All I ever wanted
Ah

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
All I ever wanted was to live my life
All I ever wanted was the syrup in my sprite
All I ever wanted
Yes, all I ever wanted whoa
All I ever wanted was to live my life
All I ever wanted was the syrup in my sprite
All I ever wanted
Yes, all I ever wanted whoa

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Ball so hard cuz' I'm made to do
40 cal on my waist, Gucci shoelace in my shoe
Packing the pounds, I can white or brown
Putting it down from your side of town
Or maybe in the sticks, still ballin' in the mix
Drop Maserati, I can't drive a stick shift
I can Stacey Augmon, maybe Scott Skiles
I was stuck in denial, until my money was in a pile

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
All I ever wanted was to live my life
All I ever wanted was the syrup in my sprite
All I ever wanted
Yes, all I ever wanted whoa
All I ever wanted was to live my life
All I ever wanted was the syrup in my sprite
All I ever wanted
Yes, all I ever wanted whoa

[Verse 2: DollaBillGates]
Whoopin' shit, iced out my record
That's my whoopin' wrist
I whipped the drop top to show them sympathy
You know my policy, no apologies
I whip the right like apollo creed
American dream, in the USA
Everybody want the fame
I need a thousand Ms up in the bank
Damn, that's a billion dollars
I had the floaters on my Lexus GS 300
I been had a problem

[Outro: RiFF RAFF]
I'm sorry (x infinity)
My house is three stories and my girlfriends is gorgeous
I'm sorry (x infinity)
My house is three stories and my girlfriends is gorgeous
