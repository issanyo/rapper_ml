[Hook] x2
I left your keys on the nightstand just leave me alone
Can tell by your attitude that you don't need me no more
You're so ungrateful, I mean your heart's too hateful

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
She say she want that baseball dick
I told her I'm chasing money till I'm baseball rich
The more you got the more you spend, the saying couldn't be truer
Spending money I ain't made, I call it mañana's mula, Ooh I
I got it, yeah I got it, bitch I'm serving up the game
I'm Andy Roddick, yeah I'm 'bout it
I'm on a roll till the wheels off
Banana dick, I just hit it once and then I peel off
These TVs and these magazines, retweets don't be mad at me
Bitch I'm balling yeah I'm balling, shit my nickname should be Spalding
I'm on the come up, you can see why
Cause winning's in my genes homie and I ain't talking Levi's

[Verse 2: MOD SUN]
I asked myself, how I did, I even get here in the first place
Only took one hit and, been addicted since the first taste
Cruising down the 405 got my window down
They know me too well and thats when I skip town
And Im bout to disappear like we chopping up a pound
Bet you know what that mean when I say I make it bounce
Told you a million times that I lost Kanyack??
Cause I bossed out
One time for the times that the times of our lives
With the eyes on the rise and theres no surprise
We got tossed out, we call the shots now
Every gypsy wanna talk now
Got legit like a bar code, bringing by the car load
So clean that I sparkle, you wont hear me, Donnie darko
Say hello to excellence, my sentences is pepper mints
I ain't doing this for dead presidents
But imma buy my mama new residence
And until I do that, tell my ma I won't coming back
Remind them, its all about timing, so if you looking for the keys
Heres where you can find um'

[Verse 3: Huey Mack]
Baby I can make you feel like you a star
We don't gotta have no money to seem like were living large
He's just out here, giving you venereals
I'm just trying to get you wet like Ariel
You my mermaid, go ???, tell? the bitches all fake taupe

How you feel, how you feel
I went number 4 in the country
I did that without a deal
Fuck love, I ain't 'bout that shit
Tell a bad bitch go and suck my dick
Put it on ???, cause its bout that life
Your bitch probably go to sleep to nick-at-nite
Shout out RiFF RAFF no James Franco
I'm just tryina put my Ape in your A-hole
Get it ASAP, do it for the pesos
Tell her ??? check my bankroll
And who cares if I got chubby
Cause I guarantee your bitch still wanna fuck me
