Tic-tac-toe
X these haters out like tic-tac-toe
Deion sandals on my toe
Deion sandals on my toe
X these haters out like tic-tac-toe
X these haters out like tic-tac-toe
Deion sandals on my toe
Deion sandals on my toe

Mothafuck county
I ain't gonna stop until my name on a mountain (Mount Rushmore)
Tell me who counting
Who keeping score?
I don't want your girl cuz she look like Jay Leno (big chin)
Never had a wife, oh no not Riff
Rather slice a brick, throw some ice on my wrist
I'd rather box Porsche with a polar bear fist
Might pull up May 5th in the candy goldfish
Bi polar paint seats look like tiger paws
Eating lobsters, sharks, screen's on watchin' Jaws
Rap game Julio Franco, Chuck Norris, Texas Ranger
Ice on my fingas look like I slap-boxed a penguin, I slap-boxed a penguin

Tic-tac-toe

X these haters out like tic-tac-toe
X these haters out like tic-tac-toe
Deion sandals on my toe
Deion sandals on my toe
