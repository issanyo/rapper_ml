[Hook: Andy Milonakis]
Nah, I ain't late
I make 'em wait, make 'em wait
I make 'em wait

[Verse 1: Andy Milonakis]
I got no watch, I got no clock
I don't really give a care
Everyday I wear a brand new pair of underwear
Nah, I ain't late
I make 'em wait then wait them wait some more
I'll rupture and puncture punctual whore
I roll out in the Jag doing 20 that's the max
Sipping Henny in the back, no Google maps
I'm just a slow poke
This ho on codeine, she a slow poke
Fuck a time piece, that shit's for old folks and ho's bloke
I'm just a rocky raccoon
Let's eat shrooms and swim to the moon
I'm floating in slow-motion, mate

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
Strapped for protection, safe sex
Working out in the living room, bowflex
Big face hundreds smell like cat fish
Chuck Norris wrist reverse spinnin' back fist
Now I’m in the backwoods with Sally Struthers
Your mom in my jacuzzi counting bubbles
They tried to bait me in me in like a paper boy
Ramen noodles on the counter as a decoy
I can sip moonshine for indegestion
I can ride the Clydesdale like Willie Nelson
Might have to camp at [?]
Three white bitches in the mountains
Wilson Phillips

[Hook: Andy Milonakis]

[Verse 3: Dirt Nasty]
I'm running late as usual
I got a blonde date that's beautiful
Fat ass, you should see the booty bro
And she can handle the balls, Ricky Rubio
I make em wait like a hostage
Then walk in the office dangling my sausage
I'm Bob Costas in a Mazda Miata
With a chicken Slovakian mobster’s fuckin' daughter
Hold her head under hot water
And feed her fried possum like a bottle nose dolphin
I make 'em wait like a fucking scrub
And if she says two words
Boxing gloves
