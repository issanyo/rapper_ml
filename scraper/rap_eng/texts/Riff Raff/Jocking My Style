[Intro]
Jockin' my style
Jockin' my style
DJ Afterthoughts biatch
Jockin', jockin' my style

[Chorus]
Jockin' my style
Jockin' my style
Everybody know you've been jockin' my style
I let that shit go, let it slide for awhile
But everybody know you've been jockin' my style
Jockin' my style
Jockin' my style
Everybody know you've been jockin' my style
I let that shit go, let it slide for awhile
But everybody know you've been jockin' my style

[Verse]
Started out small (small)
Watch ya boy ball (ball)
Zigzag braids 'bout to shut down the mall (mall)
They tryna ruin my day (day), they tryna copy my ways (my ways)
You copycat, that bitches seem to be choppin' the burger on blaze (on blaze)
You slept in for several days, you slept on like a mattress (mattress)
They tryna copy my fashion (fashion), I'm slidin' on Aladdin (Aladdin)
I'm sittin' on aqua satin (satin), [?] for my assassin
More wood than a log cabin, like a cherry wood wheel
Gingerbread over teal

[Chorus]
Jockin' my style
Jockin' my style
Everybody know you've been jockin' my style
I let that shit go, let it slide for awhile
But everybody know you've been jockin' my style
Jockin' my style
Jockin' my style
Everybody know you've been jockin' my style
I let that shit go, let it slide for awhile
But everybody know you've been jockin' my style
