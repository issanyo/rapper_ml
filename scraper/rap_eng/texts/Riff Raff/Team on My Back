[Intro]
Huh, team on my back
Leaned on the 'lac
Team on my, team on my back
Leaned on...
Team
Huh, yeah

[Chorus]
Team on my back
Leaned on the 'lac
Team on my, team on my back
Leaned on the 'lac
Huh, I like to go a hundred on the highway
I like to do it my way (huh)
Team on my back
Leaned on the 'lac
Team on my, team on my back
Leaned on the 'lac
Yeah, I like to go a hundred on the highway
Don't come at me sideways

[Verse]
Some say that crime pays
Maybe on a Friday
Complex, down behind my lip like a pirate ship
My rose, gold obsession
Gave the world a deep depression
You can tell by my expression that you can't teach me no lessons
I don't mean to be rude but I fuckin' hate due
Don't put me in a bad mood while I'm eatin' Cuban food
My chain is Cuban link, fuck what he think
14 karat sink for Jodi Husky to clean his mink
He rocks that fur coat, I flip Versace boat
I put on 60 pounds so I obviously like to smoke
