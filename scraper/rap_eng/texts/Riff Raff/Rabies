[Hook: Riff Raff]
A fresh set of braids, you cannot fade me
Rolling down your block, you gotta hate me
I'm rocking so much ice, you want to ice skate me
Keep on biting my style and you gon' catch rabies
Keep on biting my style, you gon' catch rabies
Keep on biting my style, you gon' catch rabies
Rocking so much ice, you want to ice skate me
Keep on biting my style and you are gon' catch rabies, catch rabies

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Riff, 400 Degrees like I'm Juvenile
Walk inside my house, you see Versace tiles
Don't worry bout my garage, I keep a cool toy
Don't worry bout that drank spill, I got a towel boy
My Almond Joy pen broccoli baby Benz
Aqua gray lens, looks like a dolphin fin (splash)
I've been cooling with my friends, attitude arrogant
My breath peppermint, homicide track no evidence

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ghetty]
Back off in this thing, it's like I never left
So much loud on deck, I swear I'm going deaf
Fourth quarter, I think it's time to call press
Lock these boys down, like I'm Ron Artest
Pull up in that white Regal
Bitch, I feel like Bugsy Siegel
Stuntin' like my name Knievel
Pocket full of dead people
Talking bout them presidents
Trying to bite my style cause you ain't fresh as this

[Hook]
