[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
Diamond on my wrist
Crawling through the Six
Paid on the fifth
By you and your bitch
Swish
Swish
Diamond on my wrist
Crawling through the Six
Paid on the fifth
By you and your bitch
Swish
Swish

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Fuck you and your team
Fuck you and your squad
I'm balling against all odds
I'm still praying to God
Still hope for the best
50K across my chest
Never learned from the best
Besides the pillow when I rest
Still keeping my cool
Balling acting a mule
I gave her my all
But she still played me like a fool
Bitch, I still got me
Wrist cost 53
Still got a quarter of key
When I wanna talks with my OGs
Cause I can't get played
But I'm 'bout to get valeted
Drop fifteen hundred
Get your pussy ass sprayed
Hands in the sky while I'm smoking on fry
Make your bitch ass disappear
Viola

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
Diamond on my wrist
Crawling through the Six
Paid on the fifth
By you and your bitch
Swish
Swish
Diamond on my wrist
Crawling through the Six
Paid on the fifth
By you and your bitch
Swish
Swish
Diamond on my wrist
Crawling through the Six
Paid on the fifth
By you and your bitch
Swish
Swish
Diamond on my wrist
Crawling through the Six
Paid on the fifth
By you and your bitch
Swish
Swish

[Verse 2: Jay Fizzle]
Rollie on my wrist
A thou[s]an[d] for the kicks
I just fucked somebody thick
Young red bitch
Shoot your shot
3-point, straight net swish
Burn her head
Throw her out like a bad gift
I don't sneak diss
I don't rap beef
Niggas speak my name
I pull up like a taxi
I got the Draco and the seat belt on the front seat
You know my Instagram pussy, nigga, at me
Behind tint, smoking sherbet while I'm laughing
Might blow a couple stacks down in Magic
These niggas out here swear that they flew past me
I'm really on they ass, so how they pass me?

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
Diamond on my wrist
Crawling through the Six
Paid on the fifth
By you and your bitch
Swish
Swish
Diamond on my wrist
Crawling through the Six
Paid on the fifth
By you and your bitch
Swish
Swish
