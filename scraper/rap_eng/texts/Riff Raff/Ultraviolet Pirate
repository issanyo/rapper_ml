[Intro]
Uh, yeah, alright
Uh, uh, yeah, uh

[Verse]
Shout out to Yachty, pull up in a big boat
Brick off the balcony, I hope coke floats
Brown diamonds like a root beer float
VS1 diamonds all over my throat
Codeine castle with a drawbridge and moat
Can't hold a convo, pocket full of snow
Let me roll the blunt, I can't smoke a pre-mold
Summer comin' soon, rockin' the fur coat
Crunch time and I bet I don't choke
You got Actavis? That's all I need to know
They don't love you no more, they want you to go broke
Rose gold Patek, bust down like a snow globe
Throw his body off of 610 and Post Oak
30K for a show, show
I can go twenty though, that's if you need me for the low
That's twenty minutes
Leave the engine runnin' while the rims spinnin'
I can go, I can jump in when I'm finished
Raspberry seats in a butterscotch Bentley
Nine nine, I was drivin' Infiniti
Hydroplane from South Spain to Italy
Biloxi, where the fuck is Jody Husky?
Trust me, it get disgusting
Touch me, knock the turkey out your stuffing
Bum rush like a Russian
Now I'm drinkin' Moscow mule (Damn)
I just made forty grand on the cool
Left hand filled with cool blue jewels, RiFF, RiFF, RiFF
