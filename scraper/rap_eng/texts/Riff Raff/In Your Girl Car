In your girl (x3)
In your girl car
(REPEAT 6x)

Uh, how how ya
How ya gonna hypnotize fame?
Five star face with the Wonder Woman chain
Chains super stupid,
Jumps out like cupid,
I can I can candy Buick with the powersteering fluid

Mind Rubik's cube
Cool cub for my conscience
Her ass must be from Seattle
Cause it's Supersonic

It's a - thin line
Between love and hate
Diamonds in your face
Tatted back to Florida State
