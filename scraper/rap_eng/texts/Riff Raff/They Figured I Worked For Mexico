[Hook: Riff Raff] x2
Walkin' through the house in my white robe
All this snow I got, you figured I worked for Mexico
Mexico, gotta be from Mexico
All this snow I got, you figured I worked for Mexico

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
I pull up Sally Struthers after nightfall
I put a komodo dragon in my front yard
I don't have the time to be double checkin'
I done-I done tour bus, it's a double decker
Checkers on the shoes eating fudge cups
Jumping in and out the lambo, double dutch
I got more "white girl" then a sock hop
Jody Highroller pulled up candy butterscotch
Bad Puerto Rican wearing tube socks
Now she, now she half naked playing hop scotch
Riff Raff in the 7 it's a good night
Now I'm in your kitchen, food fight

[Verse 2: Lil Link]
Let me think, how do I start this?
I be chillin' outside where the park is
What park? Who don know
I'm just chillin' by myself with my damn bulldog, uh
Cause I'm so fucked up
My brain's fucked up and I'm so fucked up
Yeah, so I thought I'd go on a beat
Spit heat, let you fakes try to copy me
But that's alright man
I'm here all night fam, doin' some writin'
And I'm kushed right out
So fucked up I'mma sleep on my couch
And I wake next morning, still snorin'
Get to the fridge, get some orange juice pourin'
Now I gotta just sesh
Kush is the best, kush gon' be my death cause I love that shit
I hug that shit, you wanna touch that quick, don't touch that shit
Yeah, you can't stand this
It got bitches actin' scandalous
Rap Cannibus
You can't handle this, so let's bang with this
This track, this track
I run rap like I run a lap
Get back, you done rapped
I don't need you in my life so fuckin' take that, uh
Now laugh it off
Your girl gotta cough, she can jack me off
Okay, now that's on the next level
I don't give a fuck, she could ride me like a pedal
Yeah, call me Lil Link the rebel
In and out the ghetto, never rollin' with the metal
