[Hook: Riff Raff]
I pull up paranoid on the board
I'm pulling down so hard and I'm sipping on that bar, that's that drink
And my pocket's got a fat bank
And my pocket's got a fat
Bank my pocket's got a fat bank

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
When I step right stay out of my sight
Leaning at the light with the burner clutch tight,(tight)
Tight edge fade cover up the (Ver)'sace braids (braids)
Neon lights rave fifty grand on the razor blade
Cut so precise, princess cuts on the white (white)
Never had a wife but if I did perfect height (Five Three)
Perfect time piece maybe Rolex on the wrist (wrist)
Baby blue barest powder spoiler with the kit (kit)
Crawling like a kitten bitch I'm crawling like a snail (snail)
Engine V-12 gas supreme at the Shell (pump)
Shell toe'd Adidas maybe Grant Hill by Fila's
Hater's can't see us lay 'em flat like tortillas (tillas)

[Hook: Riff Raff]
I pull up paranoid on the board
I'm coming down so hard and I'm sipping on that bar that's that drank
And my pocket's got a fat bank and my pocket's got a fat
Bank my pocket's got a fat bank

[Verse 2: Dirt Nasty]
Pocket full of bank
Bolivian cash in the tank
Smuggling Snuggies across the states Illegal El Salvadorean
Yeah you will believe it when you seem me open the doors on the Porsche Delorean
Born again Bermuda Bahamas in flower pajamas I slap bitch your arm pits
You knew I was in Menudo in the '82 Peugeot bonin' your culo
Slap my balls on your dad's desk and be like "Whatchu gonna do 'bout this, nothing"
You a bitch stay attached to my fists when I slap your mom in the dick and shit(What)

[Hook: Riff Raff] X 2
I pull up paranoid on the board
I'm coming down so hard and I'm sipping on that bar, that's that drink
And my pocket's got a fat bank
And my pocket's got a fat
Bank my pocket's got a fat bank

[Andy Milanokis]
From the heads to the toes to the soul that they don't got
All they care about is the next patron shot
These fake rappers want what what Al Capone got
'Til they on the street leaking with they back of their dome shot
Like that Teflon don shit you Zac Efron
Get stepped on by this fat kid that gets slept on
Suck your mama dry
Suck your mama dry
Your jealous cuz I excel at everything I try
I'm outlandish I'll even speak Spanish
Like mi casa su casa viva la raza
I'm a Reggaeton Rasta La Bamba La Bamba
Mi Bailar Samba bye bye Simba
Three D ninja me eat (ginger)ginga and Wasabi
Omakase Ke-mo sah-bee

[Hook: Riff Raff]
I pull up paranoid on the board
I'm coming down so hard and I'm sipping on that bar that's the drink
And my pocket's got a fat bank and my pocket's got a fat
Bank my pocket's got a fat bank
