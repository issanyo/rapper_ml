[Verse 1: Dirt Nasty]
I think back on the olden days
Back in high school I could smoke an eighth
Make a sandwich open-faced
Moneyballin', Oakland A's
Rap game Brad Pitt
Why your mama got a black ass dick (What!?)
Lookin' like Jonah Hill, she fat and skinny what the deal
Bitch need to hit the gym
I hit her in the chin if she keep eating Slim Jims
I'm Macho Man, get head from a chicken in a Roscoe's van

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF] X 3
Nice rims
Sitting behind tint
(Sitting behind tint)
(Sitting  behind tint)
Sitting behind tint

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
I'm posted
Overseas French-toasted
Champagne Dreams, Nova Scotia Testarossa
Nine on the belt
[?] for the self
Farrah Faucett health
In a can of skim milk
Me myself
Eating fried tuna melt
[?] commonwealth with Barack and Michelle
Muy plenty
This one for me hentai
Pull up caliente with Daisy Fuentes
Sprained ankle, in Louis Vuitton crutches
I'm on the tour bus watching Just the Ten of Us
Nice rims (Rims?)
Semi-high tint
Candy peppermint eating lobster and shrimp

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Andy Milonakis]
I'm on that pimp shit, that walk with a limp shit
King Tut, walk like an Egyptian
I better not boast but I'm better than most
Bread and cheese, I'm cheddar and toast
Cooler than the cool kids in Alaska
Got bees on my D's cause look like a [?]
Alize and Cristal blows your mind
I'm in France sipping Bordeaux wine
Pussy and wine, pussy and wine
Now let me see that pussy wind
Mac City bitch, Mac Mac City bitch
Hoes get no dough nothing on them titties bitch

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF] X 3
Nice rims
Sitting behind tint
(Sitting behind tint)
(Sitting behind tint)
Sitting behind tint
