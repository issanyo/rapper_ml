[Hook: Mandy Moore]
Give me one chance, I'ma take it
Give me one move, I could play again
So I could be care free
So I could be care free
I could be care free, yeah
I could be care free
Who's gonna watch over me
So I could be care free

[Verse: RiFF RAFF]
Big plans, holograms
Big jewels, big dreams in the candy yam
Black sliced like ham
I'm on, I'm okay now
Let the top down on the good side of town
I'm just diamond mouth
I'm just five car garages three story house
Flash back I had to sit in corner, time out (Time out mister)
Now the neighbor ask me to come over [?]
I sleep on 'sace couch
I'm a chef now, arms look like two swans (They do)
Oh shit look who it is, the white Barry Bonds
In front yard jacuzzi with the new broad (She naked)
Watch over me so I could be care free
I could be care free

[Hook: Mandy Moore]
Give me one chance, I'ma take it
Give me one move, I could play again
So I could be care free
So I could be care free
I could be care free, yeah
I could be care free
Who's gonna watch over me
So I could be care free

[Hook: Mandy Moore]
Give me one chance, I'ma take it
Give me one move, I could play again
So I could be care free
So I could be care free
I could be care free, yeah
I could be care free
Who's gonna watch over me
So I could be care free
