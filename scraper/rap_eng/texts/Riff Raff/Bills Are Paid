[Hook] x2
Can't tell me nothin'. I'm not worried at all
I live for today. A pocket full of dreams
All my bills are paid. All my bills are paid

[Verse 1: RiFF RaFF]
Woke up this mornin', the syrup started pourin'
Coffee cups by Jackie Joyner with Versace tile flooring
Rap game Alonz Mourning, or maybe Martin Lawrence
Could've played for Charlotte Hornets, but they found weed in my warm ups
Nice try, and I used to be a nice guy
Swing through Popeye’s, three piece and the cajun fries
Exceptionally on sight, never stage fright
Connections are nice, more plugs than a night light
Move slow. Macadamian wrist watch
Silhouettes in the window rap game Alfred Hitchcock
Silky smooth house, that’s way out in Sweden
Summertime every day, whole life a weekend

[Verse 2: Andy]
I eat sushi with sake bombs, eat the coochie of soccer moms
I'll sock your mom, yes I will hit a ho
Grab my pinky ring, then I'm out the door
Don't trust me cause I'm mental, trust me I'm mental
On a private jet eating caviar lentils
Bend the flight attendant like a New York pretzel
Stab the fucking pilot with a number 2 pencil
Ain't no yeast in the east to make my bread rise
So I stay baked in Cali with palm trees and red eyes
This L.A. paper is so so shady
It's just not right like homo babies

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Dirt Nasty]
Can't tell me anything, got green like an alien
Saving my money until im Arabian
Fill up a stadium, then I don't go
I'm in the motel down the road doing blow, alone
Wanna be rich, but I know it'll kill me
Stash infinity dollars in the chimney
The mob wanna hit me, and get me
Balls in Bahamas, my head up in Sicily
Fuck that, you can't tell me nada
I'm saving my dollars for the whole enchilada
Bitch, I'm the American dream, I balance
Coke and hoes on my triple beam
