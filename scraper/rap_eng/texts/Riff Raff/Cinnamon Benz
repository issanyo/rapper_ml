[Hook x2]
It don't matter what car that I'm driving
All of my diamonds rearranged em
I ain't got no problem with ya' baby
All of my bitches drive Mercedez

[Verse 1]
50 grand large, rap game Charles in Charge
Jumping out with stars with a maroon Visa card
Who is you?
I eat Versace noodle soup
Dragon berry coupe, rims look like hoola-hoops
Ball with Sheryl Swoopes, taco cherry roof
Watch this move
I pull up, candy ally-oop
Throw it off the glass, like Darth Vader
Moving up in luxury, Escalade elevator
Crawling like molasses, sipping syrup out the maple
Back in eighth grade, I jumped over a group of fifth graders
How you like my driving, from the back seat
I don't want your gal, that bitch pussy smell like camel cleats

[Hook]

[Verse 2: DollaBillGates]
Turn in, bet she gon' turn in
Your living joint, my stripping joint, you know she gon' put that work in
Been twerking, all the night
Been working, all the day
And now she got them panties up, she earn her shit the harder way
Pimping, so different
Need I mention, my women
Only ten pieces or better, niggas better watch their distance
I be plucking, them chicken's
I be stuffing, them turkey's
Call me Gz' or call me James, cause in this game I am so worthy
The way that she ride, Kentucky Derby
That Sprite be so pink, look like it's Kirby
Oh my god she the shit, we got it live in this bitch
When she arrive in this bitch, we feeling fly cause we the shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ?]
Uh, she only do it when she want to
Strip up in the whip, but never in the hotel
Make it to the strip, the women looking so real
Cause she got a ? , I be safer if I don't tell
Why my eyes ? , Asian and pouring
Every thick chick with the skin so golden
Whether it's a ten and nationality chosen
Or if she's Italian, bigger booties and noses
I need parts, never bringing water to a slide and park
You could find me parched
So I guess lurking, high class, and perfect
Scoping out the hoes with red bones, and thirstin'
Issues, like I used to on a regular
'Course I got a honey on the side who's ahead of her
'Course I got a cutie up north who's a registered sex contender
Who calls me a competitor

[Hook]
