[Intro]
I, I have a dream
I, I have a dream
I, I have a dream

[Hook]
Only Americans eat duck sauce
Only Americans eat duck sauce
Only in America
Only in America
Only Americans eat duck sauce
Only Americans eat duck sauce
Only in America
Only in America

[Verse 1]
One thing about me is I don't do shit for free
Regardless what you seen, still gallons of codeine
Regardless what you say I'm still thunder storm gray
Regardless what they said I'm still cranberry red
Only in America moving slower than molasses
They thought they needed glasses when I copped that codeine castle
It's the white Don King, J pinky ring
When I was 17, copped the Chrysler Sebring
Never had a older brother, always had to guard me
Versace sheets when I sleep next to AR-15s

[Hook]
Only Americans eat duck sauce
Only Americans eat duck sauce
Only in America
Only in America
Only Americans eat duck sauce
Only Americans eat duck sauce
Only in America
Only in America

[Verse 2]
When the world is not safe, everybody wants a raid
Wanna take my place or does she want what's in my safe
Take me out to eat, buy Versace for my feet
Drive me home in a Lambo then fuck me for free
If I have kids they going straight home school
Codeine water fountain sipping lean by the pool
Children growing up to be professional Snapchatters
Even substitute teachers, these days is battle rappers

[Hook]
Only Americans eat duck sauce
Only Americans eat duck sauce
Only in America
Only in America
Only Americans eat duck sauce
Only Americans eat duck sauce
Only in America
Only in America

[Outro]
I, I have a dream
I, I have a dream
I, I have a dream
I, I sip codeine
I, I have a dream
I, I sip codeine
I, I sip codeine
Yeah, only in America
