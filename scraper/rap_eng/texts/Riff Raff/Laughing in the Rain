[Intro:]
I ain't playing no games
I ain't playing no games
Trapping in the rain
Jumping out the rain
Laughing in the rain
But I ain't playing no games
I ain't playing no games
I ain't playing no games
Laughing in the rain
Trapping out the rain
Trap-Trapping in the rain
I ain't playing no games
I ain't playing no games
I ain't playing no games

[Hook:]
Jumping out the rain
Laughing in the rain
Laugh-Laughing in the rain
I ain't playing no games
I ain't playing no games
I ain't playing no games
Laughing in the rain
Jumping out the rain
Stacking all my change
Live for finer things
But I ain't playing no games
I ain't playing no games
I ain't playing no games
Got me laughing in the rain
Jumping out the rain
Trapping in the rain

[Verse 1:]
Two-fifty karats in my damn denim (bugs bunny!)
Three tour buses like Burt Reynolds (Burt!)
Watch me play rough, Rap game Ray Lewis (chia!)
Might pull up silk shirt like Parker Lewis (can't lose!)
I don't got no kids, I'm not your father (nope!)
I could never get married, I'm not Tony Parker (no!)
Might pull up San Antonio in the Bentley Spur (vroom!)
Had to erase her number, she getting on my nerves (bye-bye!)
Your neighbors getting mad cause the music shake (boom-boom!)
I don't got no neighbors, I just bought a lake (splash!)
Trapping like a monster, Neon v-neck
Look like loch ness, Rap game Johnny Quest

[Hook:]
Jumping out the rain
Laughing in the rain
Laugh-Laughing in the rain
I ain't playing no games
I ain't playing no games
I ain't playing no games
Laughing in the rain
Jumping out the rain
Stacking all my change
Live for finer things
But I ain't playing no games
I ain't playing no games
I ain't playing no games
Got me laughing in the rain
Jumping out the rain
Trapping in the rain
