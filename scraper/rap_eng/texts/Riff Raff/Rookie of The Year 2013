Make the right solution before I cause confusion
Martha Stewart candy fuchsia on the sewage Buick
When I freestyle, it's a community service
I should have played ball for the Houston Cougars
You don't know my name? My face in different comic books
They figured I was kin to Mike Tyson the way I stay with fire hooks
Tan belts, my upper torso rockin' lamb silk
10 tan twins massage my health Virginia common wealth
When they say they don't know me? It's hamstring burglary
Drop me 20k a show, it's common courtesy
Brazilian queens take me on vacation, Palm Springs
Draw strings curtains back, reveal diamond rings
Ring roster road tester drop testerosa CLK Kompressor, venomous session
Phoenix Suns confessions, I shoot shots like Van Exel
I'm Dan Majerle on the strawberry Harley

I'm in the black & white 5th wheel leaned back like a domino
I play with my knowledge although I can't be tarnished
5 levels of frequency, callers on dialtones
Cantaloupe on siren, sounds like a wind chime
At sunset I play in full swing
At batting practice, I'm Wade Boggs with the purple pogs
My backpack is Jansport in high school I played 7 sports
When tennis balls hit the fence I serve 8 balls like Andre Agassi
In the pearl Mitsubishi diamante circle makes a square fool
But circle circle makes a square
Circle circle makes a square fool
Circle circle makes a square
