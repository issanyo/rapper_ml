[Bridge: Ghetty]
Hop on-Hop on up on the track
And i'm about to spit that dumb shit
Heard-Heard you on the track
So this some shit you really wanted
Rap-Rap game fucked up
But you can't blame me
Get-Get me one shot
I guarantee i'm going crazy

[Hook: Ghetty]
Dumb-Dumb shit, dumb shi-dumb shit
Du-Dumb shit, dumb shit
Dumb shit, (all i know is...)
Dumb shit, dumb shit
Dumb shit, dumb shit
Dumb shit
Bitch, all i spit is...

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm counting papers, rolling papers, watching time fly
California grapes, I'm breaking fine wines
Me i'm sky high, my bitch down to earth
Money in the bank, weed roller in her purse
And i ain't slacking on the job, my dawg, I been alert
Been getting cake, bank (?)
Big numbers on the net, so niggas show love
And the diamonds on my neck should make these hoes trust
On the road, at the venue, filled with model hoes
College shows, smoking grade A, honor roll
Bad broad, light skinned
Hood niggas, white friends
And I ain't gotta talk much as in your face
Give me brain cause she say she got expensive taste
Let her rub my tattos, now she flying
Smoking zig-zags too, nigga rap like crack so i'm with that

[Hook: Ghetty]

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
Yuh, dumb shit
Walk inside my house all you see is new couches and thumbprints
For instance, I got it from a distance
You work, I'm the CEO, you get assistance
John Stockton, fuck boxing
I drop the top on the Porsche Box, Rick Fox
I shoot shots, figured I was a globe trot
The way I circulize the word
Circulize, diamonds got babys little pearl
I'ma bowlin ball swirl, might be sherbert
Work wood like pervert
I leave it real specific
I'm calling you from Canada, long distance
Don't make me get resistant
I resist arrest, with piece chain at chest
Throw back Travis Vest, hit them with the left hand
I give you a little up front then the rest, man

[Hook: Ghetty]

[Verse 3: Ghetty]
10 on the re-up, white like cocaina
Married to my money so i didn't sign a pre-nup
Ill stay paper and I stay on some trap shit
20 racks spent and im still spending racks, bitch
50 racks made got me laying in the shade
Time to cut the grass, hit these snakes with the blade
Saw 'em with a half zip when he came to my city
Rolled up two joints, and he blew them bitches with me
Shout out my boy RiFF RAFF, we just out here trying to get cash
Do it slow, I might spit it fast, I might speed it up like I hit the gas
It's that ill state, H-Town, Pittsburgh we stay connect
Ask her out, i'm well respected from the ill state way down in Texas
Shining like a neckless, driving reckless
Driving Chevys, i won't buy a name, scratching names up off the checklist
Bout to eat these pussy ass rappers up for breakfast
Grab a pen and just wright some fake shit and make your next club hit
Me, I'm going stupid and ima bout to spit that dumb shit
Dumb bitch!
