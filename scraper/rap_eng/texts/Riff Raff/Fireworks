[Hook: Riff Raff]
Blowing up like fireworks, I'm blasting off
Voice mail from a nasa car
Blowing up like fireworks, I don't pass the ball
I'm trying to tear the basket off, tear the basket off

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
11th grade how that boy got 5 cars? (cinco!)
Bank account sitting stupid like the major stars
Rocking wild dogs going garage in the front yard
They figured I was Swedish the way I receive Swedish massage
Break the mic Friday night Versace night light
Turned a perfectly nice evening to a fright night
January bought a gate for my phantom weight?
I can meditate and make the trunk levitate
Small rims get demised in the August breeze
Rap Game Drew Brees burning palm trees
Tree tops flashing rocks in my reeboks
Lap drop? screen clothes after aftershock

[Hook]

[Verse 2: DBG]
In highschool I made more cash than the counselor
Fuck my math teacher, I had more class than her
But I was skipping school getting to the loot
Just so I could come through in a custom coop
Now I'm jumping out the gym I'm in the rafters
Fly to Toronto balling with the Raptors
This a picture perfect shit you need to capture
You only see this car on Sunday like the pastor
I got voice mail car that came from outer space
I just flew a bitch in and she came from out of state
Whaaa, I think she from Miami
She think I'm taking her to the Grammy's

[Hook]
