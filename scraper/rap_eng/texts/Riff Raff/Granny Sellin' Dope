[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
I caught my granny sellin' dope, granny, granny sellin' dope
Granny, granny sellin' dope, I caught my granny sellin' dope
I caught my granny sellin' dope, granny, granny sellin' dope
Granny, granny sellin' dope, I caught my granny sellin' dope

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
The codeine holds me hostage (Hostage)
I'm selling yachts on the outskirts of Boston
Bitch rappers, they come and they go (Go)
My granny slanging snow out of my condo (Go)
Had to ship her ass back to Toronto
Never will I speak for free (Free)
Who the fuck is you? You ain't talkin' to me (Me)
20K is the fee (Fee)
For a bitch ass hater to interview me (RiFF)
Have you seen my diamonds on teeth? (Teeth)
That's a friendly reminder that talk is not cheap (No)
Versace sheets in the back of the Jeep (Go)
Seven cars for the days of the week (Go)
Smokin' sweets with Meryl Streepe (RiFF)
Why don't you take you a picture or somethin'? (Somethin')
Jumpin' up out of the candy pumpkin (Work)

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
I caught my granny sellin' dope, granny, granny sellin' dope
Granny, granny sellin' dope, I caught my granny sellin' dope
I caught my granny sellin' dope, granny, granny sellin' dope
Granny, granny sellin' dope, I caught my granny sellin' dope

[Verse 2: Snap Dogg]
Snap, slide
Granny wanna give me that pussy (Pussy)
Front her a bowl of that cookie (Cookie)
You know you ain't playin' with a rookie (Nah)
All blues in my hand like Tookie (Racks)
In the gun store, I need ammo (Ammo)
Grindin' real hard for a Lambo
Thirty on my wrist and it's damn froze (Rollie)
I put in work (What?), niggas that put you on shirts
They will put you in the dirt (Grah, grah)
You can get hurt (Man down)
Granny was baggin' the dirt (Huh?)
Auntie was baggin' them percs (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yah)

[Chorus: RiFF RAFF]
Granny sellin' dope, granny, granny sellin' dope
Granny, granny sellin' dope, I caught my granny sellin' dope
I caught my granny sellin' dope, granny, granny sellin' dope
Granny, granny sellin' dope, I caught my granny sellin' dope
