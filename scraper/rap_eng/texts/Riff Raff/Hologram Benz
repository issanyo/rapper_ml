Nice mint, lemon berry tint
Pulled up two times on some Siamese twins
Copped the Fitzgerald in the red Ranger
Diamonds dancing on my finger, Macarena (damn)
Might be balling, jumping out the gym
Me and Harmony Korine in a hologram Benz
I can steal cookies from your daughter's lunch
Red rubies on my chain look like Hawaiian Punch
