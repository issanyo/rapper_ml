[Intro: RiFF RAFF]
Kill em
All you see is ice
All you see is ice
Cause it's iceberg season
All you see is ice, ice
All you see is ice
All you see is
All you see is ice
All you cause it's...

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
Ice, ice, iceberg season
Now I'm on the highway, you see me bumpin weavin
Ballin on the Monday make it feel like the weekend
Walk inside the room got you feeling Nike freezing
Ice, ice, iceberg season
Now I'm on the highway, you see me bumpin weavin
Ballin on the Monday make it feel like the weekend
Walk inside the room got you feeling Nike freezin

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Midnight trappin and I'm hot like an oven
James Brown burner with the perm and the English muffin
Stupid fruity chain and my chain go for 60
Flossin so hard make them haters wanna get me
Homeward bound and I stay on some trap shit
Bust it out the package, bust it baby doin gymnastics
College bitches on my phone, like it ain't nothing
Girl don't go in the kitchen you might run into your mama
Cookin like Martha and she bringin home the bacon
Bringin home the bacon got me rockin Marcus Jacobs
Marcus Fizer jumpshot, running from the fuckin cops
Keep it all cool with a smile on my facial

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]

[Verse 2: 50 Tyson]
I ain't gon lie man, I'm 50 Tyson man
I'm feelin like an icy, man I'm feeling like a star
Tell you when you see me, cause you see me I'm comin on
Doing like a Weezy and I'm feelin like it freeze me
All yall niggas freeze me, all yall niggas freeze me
Feeling like a freezy, Minnesota ?, Minnesota go
I'm ballin on these ?, man I'm ? hustlin boi I do this
I'm freezing like a snowman but I'm 50 Tyson tho
Icy car when I'm ridin 20's and them 28's, know I'm ridin 24's
Wear them chains on my neck when I'm ?`...
