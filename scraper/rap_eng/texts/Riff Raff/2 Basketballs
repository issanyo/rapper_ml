[Intro]
Let me see you bounce it
Let me see you bounce it

[Hook]
She got an ass like two basketballs (Let it bounce)
She got an ass like two basketballs (Let it bounce)
She got an ass like two basketballs (Let it bounce)

[Verse: 1]
Want the top numbers? Your momma in a dumpster
Pull up working lumber in the cucumber Hummer
Swing through the jungle, navy print on the pasta
Polkadot the possum and the seats looking awesome
Yo, bounce it, Nova, swing through La Cova
Two-tone Motorola and the syrup in the soda
Ass doing tricks, thousand dollar tips
She strips, does the splits, never touch the dick

[Hook]

[Verse: 2]
Smoke chronic, maybe supersonic
Swing like a comet and her ass is bionic
Two body team, might be codeine
I'm a limousine, codeine fiend, dream team
Going H.A.M out the gates, diamonds in your face
Pocket full of grapes, rap game Nancy Grace
Rap game Nancy Drew, scientific crew
I was the only kid in school [?] in my shoes
Lace, and I purchase park place
It's a glow show, candy condo and Tahoe
Maybe Mexico

[Hook]

[Outro]
Let me see you bounce it [x4]
