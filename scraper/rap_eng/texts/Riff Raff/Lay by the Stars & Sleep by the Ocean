[Intro]
Lay by the stars and sleep by the ocean, but wait
Wait for me (Wait for me)

[Chorus]
Lay by the stars and sleep by the ocean
Lay by the stars and sleep by the ocean, but wait
Will you wait for me? (Will you wait for me?)
And if I'm away, will you pray for me? (Will you pray for me?)

[Verse]
Only time, is on our hands
But it's not on our side my love, we can only get what we can (What we can)
We can change our numbers, we can cut off our friends (Cut off our friends)
The more people, the more of a chance that we could ruin our plans
We could buy us a cabin, plenty of land
We could have us some babies
Or maybe some puppies 'til we're ready for them

[Chorus]
And we could, lay by the stars and sleep by the ocean
Lay by the stars and sleep by the ocean, but wait
Will you wait for me?
And if I'm away, will you pray for me?
We could, lay by the stars and sleep by the ocean
Lay by the stars and sleep by the ocean, but wait
Will you wait for me? (Will you wait for me?)
And if I'm away, will you pray for me? (Pray for me)

[Outro]
We could, lay by the stars and sleep by the ocean
We could, lay by the stars and sleep by the ocean
Lay by the stars and sleep by the ocean, but wait
Will you wait for me?
