[Chorus]
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Frozen femurs in the freezer, Jeffrey Dahmer
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Frozen femurs in the freezer, Jeffrey Dahmer

(Lil Debbie)
I just wanna have some fun, Cindy Lauper
Six carats in the mouth, jaw dropper
They said I'd never make it on my own two
Hold on I got Ryan Seacrest on line two, hold up
Tint look like the first lady, gettin' brain in stretched 'cedes
Coupe the color of Kanye, but the four door be Tom Brady
I'm star gazing, condos and foreign places
Female, Bernie Maydoff

[Chorus]
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Frozen femurs in the freezer, Jeffrey Dahmer
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Frozen femurs in the freezer, Jeffrey Dahmer

(Lil Debbie)
I'm presidential, a hundred servants
Internet sensation, I shut down the server
I'm fashion forward, ford model
On a pill, with a coke bottle
Coke girls, ciroc girls, came through with a top curl
They do whatever I do, thats why they never rock pearls
Only diamonds, purp and yellow, Kobe diamonds
I been toe tyin', ever since Jody signed me (high roller!)

(RiFF RaFF)
I'm at a switch blade, I threw a wish way
Versace fork in the road, I dont know which way
I should go, I could glow like the sun at noon
Might change my government name to jody 3 moons
3 spoons one for every thou, should I test?
Whirlwind molest, while I give my shows caress
Relieve stress or get kicked to somebodys curb
You on my nerves get yo ass dropped off in the suburbs

[Chorus]
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Frozen femurs in the freezer, Jeffrey Dahmer
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Presidential tint, Michelle Obama
Frozen femurs in the freezer, Jeffrey Dahmer
