[Intro: RiFF RaFF]
Yeah, it's RiFF
I just did some cool shit
I just did some cool shit
And my car cool whip
And my car...

[Verse 1: RiFF RaFF]
You a Instagram hater
I just glossed the navigator
I'm in Austin stacking paper
Balling with my paper chasers
But you still ain't me
And you ain't my pedigree
And we ain't the same breed
My wrist cost like 40 G's
I can't have no girlfriend
They don't never understand
And I'm balling stacking grass
Pull you like a rubber band
I just reset my roster
Bitch you better speak proper
Bitch I pull up at the opera
In Versace helicopter

[Hook: RiFF RaFF]
I just did some cool shit
And my car a cool whip
I just did some cool shit
And my car a cool whip
I just did some cool shit
I just did some cool shit
I just did some cool shit
And my car a cool whip
I just did some cool shit
And my car a cool whip
I just did some cool shit
I just did some cool shit
Yeah, it's RiFF
