[Hook]
Bitches sitting on my lap, Kris Kringle
Midnight skating in the trap, Kris Kringle
Pull up in the bentley sleigh, Kris Kringle
Get it popping like a pringle, what's the jingle

Bitches sitting on my lap, Kris Kringle
Midnight skating in the trap, Kris Kringle
Pull up in the bentley sleigh, Kris Kringle
Get it popping like a pringle, what's the jingle

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Rap game Johnny Bravo, painting pictures like Picasso
30 grand on the bottle, 4 million on the condo
Hustling in the cut, Kawasaki full throttle
Keep a couple of gold models, cutting coke in Toronto
I'mma bring the rice, pour the syrup in my slice
Rap game neon space, turn heads like poltergeist
Marcus thousand for protection, triple beam pyrexing
All this jewellery I'm flexing, shut down the 5 way intersection
Mixing down the game, rap game Herman Caine
The way I swang the wood frame, figured I was candy John Wayne
Off the chain, with convertible private planes
Drop invisible rain Kris Kringle deframe

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kid sister]
Let's go, Kid Sister, left hand flippin', sippin' syrup eggnog
Ball hard, Boss Hogg, grippin' Kawasaki log
Pull up in somethin', damn they extravagent
Summer time, winter time, bitch you ain't no friend of mine
And I'm ballin' like New Jersey Nets
Sweat pants, head tight, that's all I'm gettin' my head back
Scoopin' up a couple, man you ballin' on you fuck civilians
Chinchilla jet skis, resorts at the Florida Keys
No clouds in the Everglades, glare shine like cascades
Skatin' on you bitches, I should'a brought some roller blades
Plus I'll pull a couple stunts, Super Dave
Mittens in the bat cave, peppermint that candy paint
