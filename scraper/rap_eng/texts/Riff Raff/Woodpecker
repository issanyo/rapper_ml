[Intro]
Look out man
It's Jefe Wine
I had to do it
Riff Raff

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Marshaull Faulk, I opened up the vault
She popped another molly, did a somersault
I'm Summer Sanders something hotter than a summer solstice
I'm revving Rolls Royce motors but can't lose composure
I'm candy lime with Jefe Wine, we drinking wine
My Kangol hang low rainbow range rover
Now watch me chop your block in the Jag drop
Rock so many checkerboards Versace mascot
My rag drop, raspberry flavored mascot
The ascot, awh shit the white jamie Foxx
The red rock ruby rap game Matlock
My wrists tangerine, my earring apricot

[Hook: Jefe Wine]
She take a pill and pop it
And then the panties dropping
Get off my tour bus bitch if you can't make it sloppy
I need a woodpecker
Are you a woodpecker?
I need a woodpecker
Are you a woodpecker?
She take a pill and pop it
And then the panties dropping
Get off my tour bus bitch if you can't make it sloppy
I need a woodpecker
Are you a woodpecker?
I need a woodpecker
Are you a woodpecker?

[Verse 2: Jefe Wine]
