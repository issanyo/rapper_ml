I know exactly how we got here
Not giving you my best effort
A lot of people stop here
Heroes have the heart to keep stepping
Ain't no lack, Ain't no lack
Even when you short of cash
I’m
Really familiar with that feeling
But I
Gotta stop living in the past
Left a lot of my niggas back in the field
Just to be the first nigga over the hill
Bunch of bad relationships I shoulda healed
Never resurrect what God kills
But this game done been good to me
How can I ever complain
But it’s still an everyday struggle
Just to get breakfast from charlamagne

It’s deeper than what you think
If you even think at all
Most people never look up
Kuz we know its too far but it’s
Something down in me
Keep telling me I can reach
Ask the Lord to save me should
Ask the mic to help me preach

Damn

Get a coat, it’s  socold out
I feel much closer to strangers
I never felt nothing iller than
When he gave me a blessing from satan
I asked him if its authentic
He told me its something real so
Who am I to question a nigga on how he live
Ye’ without sin throw stones my nigga
Since you ain't Mr. Perfect
Nobody walking this earth is
I don’t wanna hear a word
Put that on the 3rd
Still rocking with my niggas that put money 1st
A lot of niggas cut our fellowship
Kuz I fuck with the president
Tell me who don’t
Wanna make America great again
Something I’ll never get
We fear what we don’t understand
How you worry bout’ trump but you still sleeping’ with your man
All the shit that he did to you
All the shit that you said he did
I see why you one mad bitch
Go

It’s deeper than what you think
If you even think at all
Most people never look up
Kuz we know its too far but it’s
Something down in me
Keep telling me I can reach
Ask the Lord to save me should
Ask the mic to help me preach

I stand alone in my four corner room staring at hammers
Pouring that in a Fanta
Let me doubled back got to give the scraps back to Sanford
Carolina boy but I'm stuck in traffic on Stanford
Yea clear the scene you smell the meth in the air
It's crazy I know Satan was the one who welcomed me here
Upset but it's clear that I walk in the freshest of gear
Protected for real my angels tell me heaven is near
The weapon is near
Niggas talk a good game they hurting shit
I'm only 5' 4" but I saw 36
Had to keep my record clean but I got dirty sticks
Man don't confuse that shit with weight cause I was serving nicks
I said a prayer last night do I deserve this gift
God sent a text back it read you born to kill
Niggas talk a good game what about the kids
He 17 doing 30 on his first offense

How was that
How was that
