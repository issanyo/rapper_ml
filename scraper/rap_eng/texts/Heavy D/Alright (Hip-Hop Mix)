Alright with me

[Rap: Heavy D]
Don't worry about a thing
Whatever happens, whatever may come, whatever may be
It's cool, I got it covered, beloved, from A to Z
I'm the overweight lover, Heavy bon-diddley-D
And you can flip on a trip but it's alright with me
If things were meant to be, to be and be meant
And what I'm here to represent is excellence
If you need any help, open your eyes
And it's Heavy D that you will see 'cause you're alright with me

[Janet]
Alright, woo...alright, woo...alright, woo...alright, woo
Baby, alright, woo...alright, woo...alright, woo...alright, woo
Alright with me

[Verse 1: Janet]
Seeing that your love's true
Never I'll doubt you
My heart belongs to you
That's alright with me
Worlds could end around me
So in love that I can't see
You and me were meant to be
That's alright with me

[Chorus]
Friends come and friends may go
My friend, you're real I know
True self you have shown
You're alright with me
Through thick and thick to thin
I'll love you 'til the end
You know it's true, my friend
You're alright with me
Friends come and friends may go
My friend, you're real I know
True self you have shown
You're alright with me
Through thick and thick to thin
I'll love you 'til the end
You know it's true, my friend
You're alright with me

Alright, alright with me
Alright, shoo-bee-doop-bee-doop
Alright, alright with me
Alright with me

[Verse 2]
Catch a fallin' star that shines
Make a wish, clap three times
Dreams come true it's in the mind
That's alright with me
Your wish is my command
Never thought I'd fall in love again
Again with my best friend
That's alright with me

[Chorus]
Friends come and friends may go (friends come)
My friend, you're real I know
True self you have shown
You're alright with me
Through thick and thick to thin (to thin)
I'll love you 'til the end
You know it's true my friend
You're alright with me
Always and everlasting
This love is just not passing
We're happy as can be
Alright with me

Alright, alright with me
Alright, shoo-bee-doop-bee-doop
Alright, alright with me
Alright...
It's alright, baby
It's alright, I tell you that it's alright with me
Worlds could end around me
So in love I can't see
You and me were meant to be
Sure 'nough, it's alright with me

[Rap: Heavy D]
Now be it thick as a milkshake
Or thin as a cornflake
I love you to death but I ain't pressed for the heartbreak
And anyway, who cares about what other people talk about?
I'd rather hear it from the horse's mouth
See, I believe in, being believed in
No love lives, no low tides, it's all paper thin
But watch for the trickery, some people are slippery
They appear making history, disappear like a mystery
It ain't your fault but you're a walking bank vault
Some people unliked make love as bitter as salt
They say what they want to say
Play how they want to play
But you got to live your life day by day
In order to survive you overlook and overcome
Selfish attitude or lack of gratitude for the dumb
It ain't easy being you and everything you wanna be
But whatever you do is alright with me
The bon-diddly-dee
The overweight lover MC, the cap
The rap, the hand clap, foot tap
Heavy D, dee, dee, dee

[Outro]
Alright, baby...alright, baby
Alright with me
Alright, baby...alright, baby
Alright, baby...alright, baby
Alright, baby...alright, baby
Alright, baby...alright, baby
Alright with me
Alright...alright
