Big Dadda, tell me who's hotta
Cuban cigar, burn steady non stoppa
International, one chief rocker
Like your dipability
Jiggy jiggy, heavy heavy
Baby do you want me?
Trust me, ain't to many fly like me
And deep down inside you admirin' me
I've been digging you long time
She a dime wishing you was a friend of mine
God bless nothing less give you more
And all you gotta do is tell me what you looking for...
