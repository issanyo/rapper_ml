Do me right

[Heavy D]
Ayo, Teddy, you ready?
(Teddy: Yep Yep)
Ayo, Nasty Man, you ready?
(Aaron: Ooh yeah)
What about you, Crazy Legs?
(Damion: You know I'm steppin')
Well, let's put this together
And let all the girls out there know how we wanna be done

[Rap: Heavy D]
Now would you mind if I laid you down and licked you lovely?
Made your body sticky with some bumblebee honey?
And tickled your fancy with my finger or a feather?
Worry not, my lover
The Heavster is clever
Now I'd like to hold you and squeeze you tight
But don't turn into an acrobat and flip over night
'Cause we can go on if the lovin' is strong
But I'd really hate to have to write a do me wrong song

Do me right (Repeat 4X)

[Verse 1: Aaron Hall]
I dream of you all the time
When I wake up there's a smile on my face
And when we get together
Girl, I just don't know what to say
Why is it hello, kiss, goodbye?
And then making me feel low
Can you tell me what is on your mind
I just got to know (do me right)

What is goin' on?
Can you tell me where do we go from here? (do me right)
Wanna bring you close, bring you in my heart
I wanna know that you're my girl
But girl you gotta treat me right

[Chorus 2X]
Do me right
I just wanna be your man
I want you to be my girl
Why don't you just do me right?

(You gotta do me right)

[Verse 2]
Such a sticky situation
But I think that we should take that chance
So many plans we've got ahead
Let's forget about the past
We can get to making love and romance
Girl, you're something else
I wanna get with you, believe me girl
I wanna hold you close
Keep you in my heart
I gotta know that you're my girl
Girl, you gotta treat me right

[Chorus]

(Random Girl: Who's on the phone)

[Rap: Heavy D]
Well, it's caller number one
What's the matter? Don't you recognize my voice, honey bun?
Oh, I understand
You were half-sleep
Now wait a minute--who's beeper just beeped?
I know it ain't mine, mine's is on my hip
Now tell me you didn't flip on the honey dipped, ya pocket trip
It's time to get ya heart broke
Honey, I smell smoke
You thought he was dope so you took a toke?
So here's the news: I'm ghost, I'm outta here, long gone
The lover went left, so honey, you stay strong
And when you wake up in the middle of the night
I'll be with her 'cause she, she'll do me right

Do me right
Be my girl

[Chorus (repeat until end)]
