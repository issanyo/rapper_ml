(Oho yeaheah
Who do you think ou are?)

(Who do you think you are?)

I'm rough and tough and all that stuff
I make ou dance and prance 'till you huff and puff
There's just no way you can get enough
Of me, your mister Big Stuff

I'm the overweight-er, prince dominator MC
Heavy D, constant weight gainer
And since I choose, the weight not to lose
I will stay this way so that I can bruise

MC's around, who front and frown
You go round for round, I go pound for pound
At the end of the party when you sayin' goodnight
Don't come to me and say: "Take it light", I'm your mister Big Stuff!

(Who do you think you are?
Oho, yeaheah)

I'm a quick rhyme shooter, rap rookie, recruiter
I always say could, never ever say coulda
I'm healthy and stacked, not a beast or all fat
I get applause and awards every time I rap

I love the way I am, I would never switch!
I'm the greatest entertainer since a porno flick
You move and groove to my funky tune
Party people, it's time to make a room for your mister Big Stuff

(Who do you think you are?
Oho, yeaheah)

Rock it, Big Stuff, the record, me the mastermind
A top dollar money better, go get a, designer
A fly girl lover and a woman pleaser
Girls come to me, say: "Heavy, let me squeeze ya"

An incredible, overwight huggable
Prince, a bold treat, that's why I'm so lovable
I got the knack to keep the fly girls shovin'
Two hundred and sixty pounds of good lovin'

They all want me, MC Hev D
The more of the beef the more there is to squeeze
Got the juice to get loose, make you all get up
You want a swig, give me a ring, Heavy D, youyr mister Big Stuff

(Who do you think you are?
Oho, yeaheah)

Ediie F, break down!

(Oho, yeheah)

Now I'm the swing beat artist with skills to kill
Money earnin' Mt. Vernon's where I live and vhill
When I walk the streets, I get much respect
Get hellos and what-nots from the young'uns and the vets

'Cause I never been beaten, rhymes are pre-sweetened
Duck, punk panty emcees, stop retreatin'
'Cause on Heavy D, you shouldn't be sleepin'
Takin' dirty emcees away, I'm sweepin

Got a tower, of power, MC's I devour
Every second of the hour, I send'em to the shower
I'm cool, noyt a fool, from the new school!
Drinkin' brew by my pool, sittin' on my gold stool

Gotta rock, that I drop, like a horse, on the trot
When it comes to makin money, it takes what I got
I know you're sayin' to yourself you can't get enough
But I'll be back, to attack, Heavy D, your mister Big Stuff

(Who do you think you are?
Oho, yeaheah)

(Oho, yeaheah
Oho, yeaheah
Oho, yeaheah)

(Oho, yeaheah
Oho, yeaheah
Oho, yeaheah
Oho, yeaheah)

(Oho, yeaheah)
