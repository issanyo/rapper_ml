{*36 seconds of music samples introduction*}

[Heavy D]
Smooth like raindrops, a clock goes tick tock
Nothin else to do but relax
So I cruise up the avenue, in my new convertible
I see a cutie, my duty is to flirt a little
Get out the car and shake a few hands
Kick some 'sation.. then expand
To the next territory, got some people waitin for me
Get to the spot, drop the top, and then we his-tory
Move down to the Apollo, 125th Street
That's where the people of all creeds and colors meet
Push up on a cutie, and let her squeeze me..
Easy does it, do it easy

{*samples*}

[Heavy D]
Ca-ca-ca-catch it if you can
Cause if you don't, you might m-m-m-miss it
The beat is dope, and no note, you can qu-qu-qu-quiz it
The way that I flow, is like an international pro
I'mma let you know, when I go I grow
I flow and blow, to the right tempo
My rhymes are in there, for me it's very simple
I'm the extordinaire, others they can't compare
To the six foot two half inch light skinned brother with curly hair
An Overweight Lovin machine, the Boyz are my team
My presence is felt, hearts melt like heated ice cream
When I'm through, stand up and clap your hands
But for now, ca-ca-ca-ca-catch it if you can
It's as easy as 1-2-3, A-B-C
And me, I'm the Overweight Lover Heavy D
Push up on a cutie, and let her squeeze me..
Easy does it, do it easy

{*samples*}
Break it down..
Easy does it, do it easy
Easy..
Easy does it.. bring it back..
(?) ..
Do it easy, easy, easy..

[Heavy D]
I'm laid back, on eight track, and in fact, I'm relaxed
Grab the mic.. no setbacks
Come on strong like a blizzard, the microphone wizard..
Rather exquisite
Sound check, one two one two
Many are called but the chosen are few
And I've been selected, others resurrected
My style, profile, are very well perfected
Move swiftly, stay calm then cool
Lyrics for your spirit that'll make you drool
Push up on a cutie, and let her squeeze me..
Easy does it, do it easy
