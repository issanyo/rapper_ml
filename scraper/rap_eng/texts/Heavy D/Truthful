[Hook]
You told me
You loved me
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

You told me
You loved me
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

[Verse 1]
You - you told me that you loved
But it wasn't never really me you dug
Or digged
You said I was ya nig
And come to figure out
That you was all about you
And every single step you take
You took for you

When I first met ya
You were looking rough
In ya Timbaland boots
Cut up shorts and Egyptian musk
Smelling like an African queen
Could this be my dream?
But everything ain't really what it seems

A couple of months went by
And you and I was thick
Then you started changing
And scripts began to flip
Things that you said
You had to do on Sunday
Was now moved to Monday
Where were you on Wednesday

You had to take advantage cause I was nice
If you bought me something once
I had to buy you something twice
You told me that your friends sat you down
And said you really oughta leave me
Believe me
Truthful

[Hook]
You told me
You loved me
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

You told me
You loved me
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love


[Verse 2]
Yo - too much of a party animal
I couldn't handle you
Always being out
Once in a while was understandable
Where did I go
Where did I go wrong
Was it my fault or your fault
So now I [?] over a malt
Came to the conclusion
That you were confusing
Cause all along
I thought it was wrong
I thought it was me

Started bugging out
Stopped hanging out
Feeling doubt
Wasn't looking out
But now I'm Swayze

I gave you props
You were smart and intelligent
And if things went wrong
You stood strong and rebelled against
And how you changed me
Had me reading books that amazed me
And just to say hello you would page me

Had a real pretty smile
Like an innocent child
Most of the time calm
Every now and then buck wild
Treated you good, thought I should
Always thinking of ya
You were fly and I loved ya
Truthful

[Hook]
You told me
You loved me
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

You told me
You loved me
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

You told me
You loved me
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

[Refrain]
You said you'd be around
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Yo - sad to say goodbye
But I gotta cause it's over now
Why because you did me wrong too long
Plus you broke your vow
Never meant to
But you said your time was definitely wasted
But I'm truly grateful for the flavor that I tasted

See ya
Hate to be ya
But I wish that I was with ya
Now I'll be on my way
And no, I definitely won't forget ya
I don't know where you are
Wherever you're at this one's for you
Remembering all the [?]
And different things we used to do
Truthful

[Hook]
You told me

You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

You told me
You loved me

You'd be truthful about my love

You told me
You loved me
