[Scatting for first 14 seconds]

If you think, you gon' waste, my, time (baby)
I don't think so

[Heavy D]
Ready to come in on that one
Uno, check me out, yo

[Heavster singing]
See I know how you get down
You want a nigga to put down before you go down
Always hangin around
In front of everybody, showin off yo' body
How'd you get in Puffy's party, or need I ask?
You shook yo' thing at me, playin yo' games with me

[Hook]
If you think, you gon' waste, my, time (baby)
I don't think so - baby I don't think so
Cause if you think, you gon' change, my, mind (baby)
I don't think so - no baby that's a no no

[Heavy singing again]
I see you on the corner frequently
You and yo' bum friends be hatin me (true)
Because I'm makin G's
A nigga don't owe you a thing
So now you studyin my personal
And my platinum thing
Stupid - you ain't phasin D
And all that talk you talk you ain't amazin me

[Hook]

[Female singer]
Don't stop, give it to me daddy
Don't stop, Heavy give it to me
Don't stop, give it to me daddy
Dont' stop, Heavy give it to me

[New Hook]
Cause if you think, you gon' change, my, mind (baby)
I don't think so - no baby that's a no no
If you think, you gon' waste, my, time (baby)
I don't think so - baby I don't think so
Cause if you think, you gon' change, my, mind (baby)
I don't think so - no baby that's a no no

[Female singer]
Don't stop, give it to me daddy
Don't stop, Heavy give it to me
Don't stop, give it to me daddy
Dont' stop, Heavy give it to me

[New Hook] - 1/2, music fades
