(Verse 1)
And I got friends asking me, "what's with all the tragedy
This is not the way it has to be," actually
I still see the beauty in the world that's surrounding me
But not in me, I walk through life as if I'm sound asleep
How deep are you willing to dive into
This mental prison I live in, I'm killing time like I live to
Don't judge me listen, that's just juxtaposition
It's just the position I'm in has got me questioning if it's
Even worth living if you're not making a difference
Was my existence worth the price of admission
Just things I wonder when I sit here defeated
And if they had to go back, would that mistake get repeated
And when it's all said and done, will it be said that he was
One of the greatest or a failure, will it be said that he was
His parent's greatest invention or misplaced good intentions
That never came to fruition, come here, I know you feel it in the air

(Verse 2)
And I got all these stresses from every different direction
But all I really need is time to sit and be distant, see
Growing up I was told I was special and different
Could this be the reason it seems that I'm never content with
Life and all He's given, no matter how good it's gotten
I still sit and complain, maybe I'm spoiled rotten
Maybe it's destined after so many blessings
You can become desensitized and even then get dismissive
I'm wishing, I could smell the rain, but all I hear is the thunder
I wish that I could see the rainbow, but I'm stepping in puddles
I'm jumping, through hoops and getting no crowd reaction
I take my bow, the crying clown, such a terrific actor
But when all is said and done, will it be said that he was
One of the greatest or a failure, will it be said that he was
His own greatest invention or misplaced good intentions
That never came to fruition, come here, I know you feel it in the air

(Verse 3)
And I got all these questions and not enough time to ask em
I'm walking along this path and just hope that someone I'm passing
Can stop and chat and maybe have all the answers, like
If it was really meant for me to rapping
Then how could I lose my passion in the midst of all that has happened
Me getting engaged and the timing of grandpa's passing
What does it mean, and is it a call to action
Maybe the consequences of me living my life as if
I'm self-sufficient, relying on inhibition
That mindset was self-inflicted, by-product of this condition is it
Holding me back or will it propel me forward
I'm trying to focus, I guess there's no way of knowing
Until all is said and done, will it be said that he was
One of the greatest or a failure, will it be said that he was
Hip-Hop's greatest invention or misplaced good intentions
That never came to fruition, come here, I know you feel it in the air
