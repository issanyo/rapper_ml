[Intro]
Give me the beat boy
[*Yawning*] this the funk
Yo it just me and Heavy D in the house
I can't forget [?]
Hey, I got [?] right next to me [?]
I'd like to send this out to my man, Cool V
Who you wanna send out to?
[?]
I can't forget Big Daddy Kane, and my whole crew
[?] from Centereach
And we gon' do a little something like this
Like what?

[Verse 1: Biz Markie & Heavy D]
I'm the original B-I-Z Mark
Buyin' a record like collecting put ya body in the park
This is a little something for the Juice Crew
From Hev and the boyz and Biz the DJ that's won two
This is a little something from Biz Markie
That make you get up and D-A-N-C-E
That's why I made this one just for you
To do the Heavy D shaking and Biz dance too
Now I'ma get deep like Jacques Cousteau
And the stuff that I be saying is always thorough
That's why I made a introducing due to death rap
To make your hands clapped, feet tapped
I'm like the diabolical scientist, Mr. Far
To send extra crazy super like funky vibes
'Cause I always come with stuff nobody else does
That's why they call me The Inhuman Orchestra
The Heavy D, say hi
Hey yo what you wanna know?
I wanna know if you can rock the disco show

[Verse 2: Heavy D]
Now yes, on the smooth tip, the Overweight Lover
I'm on your radio and your magazine cover
I drink Coca-Colo, remain the rhyme solo
Always wear Nike but, once in awhile I sport  polo
Before I go to bed, I drink my milk and eat cookies
Never like school, so I used to play hookie
New jacks of rap, I choose to call 'em rookie
Your choice is the Heavy D voice, now you can boogie
Emcees think I'm new to this, they must be dizzy
'Cause on the microphone Heva keep the crowd busy
Nothing in the world could ever stop my groove
The Overweight Lover's in the house, and I can get smooth

[Hook]
We write the songs that make the whole world sing
We write the songs to all the crazy things
We write the songs that make the emcees cry
Me and Heavy D, we write the songs, we write the songs

[Verse 3: Biz Markie & Heavy D]
So party people in the place, without further adieu
The S-K B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I-E is for you
Well I'm [?] number one with the rhymes I invent
Say or spit a story up to all you ladies in the gym
[?] number one master afro from all you [?]
Guaranteed to rock the mic and take out all your emcees
That's why you hear me rockin' as one of the best
I come first place and, end ya contest
With the bass in your face that you'll appreciate
I'm no ad-lib I'm legend in the all times of green
You know the emcees on a hell of a predicament
They go against the S-K-B Markie in this tournament
I go to a party, I am a spectator
When you battle me, I am Dovator
[?] in the place for a testing
Know you be chilling in the mo for the money you're spending
I came here to rap beats for your satisfaction
Biz Markie and Heavy D is the special attraction
When I came to the door you pay ten duckets
If you battle me I take you out to
[?] rockin' off for any kinda rap
To get the girl so hot, they want to get naked
I'm super duper emcee and I'm educated
1982, the year I graduated
Heavy D, say hi
Yo, what you wanna know?
I wanna know if you, I wanna know if you, I wanna know if you can rock the show
Lord have mercy on those who cursed me

[Verse 4: Heavy D & Biz Markie]
I wreck for respect but first me and Bizzie Markie's gonna dance a little
So meet your tender vittle, I mean your tricking little
Yo, can I get a little?
Microphone check one two, and three in
I am Heavy D and he's the B-I-Z-M-A-R-kie
For better for worse but not forgotten
Always fresh never stale or even rides
So Biz Markie, say hi
Hi
What you wanna know?
I wanna know if you can rock like The Disco show

[Hook]
We write the songs that make the whole world sing
We write the songs to [?]
We write the songs that make the emcees cry
We write the songs, we write the songs
