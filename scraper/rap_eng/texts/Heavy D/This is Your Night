[Intro - Heavy D talking]
Ugh
Hey, heh ha ha
This one goes out to all those who wanna do their own thing y'knowI'msayin?
Tonight is dedicated to you
Do what you wanna do, have fun
You call the shots, and it's on me ha HA
Here we go
Bring it onni onni onni onni on one

No matter what they say, no matter what they do
Tonight is your night so do what you want to
Grab a girl, grab a guy, say hi, say ho
Throw your hands in the air and let the music flow
Now here we go, once again it's the man with the wings on the double
Got my shovel and I'm diggin for skins
Now everything is alright, nobody's uptight
Could be the lights but all the girls look right
Now I'm coolin in the corner with a cutie named Judy
And a girl named Sheryl, said she been around the world
Went and strolled on her own through the club on a rub-a-dub tip
Tryin to snuggle up wit another honeydip
I see my peoples on the dancefloor doin their thing
As I 'gan to sing, believe me it's a black thing
The party's all jumpin, everything is alright
So do what you wanna do cos it's your night

[Hook - Teddy Riley]
Tonight - This is your night
Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
This is your night
Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
This is your night
Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
This is your night
Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright

[Heavy D]
I need the dancefloor stacked with back-to-back blacks
And blunts to get contact, some stunts to get tumtaps
The night is still young, the fun is still fun
Everybody move your body, it ain't nuttin but a party
Folks can I get a "ho"? (HO)
Ladies can I get a "oww"? (OWW) so hear me now
It's a regular routine thing where brothers do their thing
It ain't Arsenio, but it's definitely a night thing
The atmosphere is a rap-most-fear
And everybody from nowhere to somewhere is here
So act like you know, and float with the flow
You heard it on stereo, see it on the video
Everybody's workin up a sweat
Even though roughneck is with the roughneck step
The party's all jumpin, everything is right
So do what you wanna do cos this is your night

[Hook - Teddy Riley]
Tonight - This is your night
Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
This is your night
Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
This is your night
Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright
This is your night
Tonight - Everything's gonna be - alright

[Heavy D]
I got the goods and the goodies, some brothers be in hoodies
And some girls be in tight jeans, it's part of the night scene
Everybody is freshly dipped
Brothers be at the bar actin like movie stars, set to flip
The whole crowd's in a good groove, eatin the good food
Soul food to keep you in a good mood
Champagne flowin, people hey-hoin
Time just passed without ya even knowin
Party's like pretty sights, late nights
Flexed from a set to the next set, it's aight
The party's only jumpin, everything is tight
So do what you want because it's your night

[Hook - Teddy Riley] x2
