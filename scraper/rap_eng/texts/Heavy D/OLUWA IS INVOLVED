Yo i'm tha P to tha H-A-I-T-O (that's right)/
Guys go nuts when them hear me flow (yeah)/
I started out rolling with Chris and Xtudor/
And i bet you never heard it like this before/

Pretty Young Thing, trip all y'all with my flow/
Fellas surprised 'cos back then they use to watch me grow/
But now, they see a boy who's got the illest flow/
And this fellas don't know i'm from the U-Y-O/

I'm tha M-V-P on tha M-I-C/
And got what it takes to freeze the knees of M-J-B/
440 pounds, lift weights than G- Ali/
And i bet you know for sure who this young boy be/

Don't have to steal flows, see mine's authentic/
Like sierra leone's diamonds or chinese synthetic/
I always stand taller, that means i'm gigantic/
No matter the beef, i won't sink like titanic/

I know its not easy/ situations be leaving you dizzy/
Oooohhhhh noni/ work hard and make money ehhh....

Nobody can hold you down/ try hard and stay above the ground (yeah)/
Lift your eyes up to the sky and see the ray of light/
'cos it (scratch...) Chrome in the studio/
You can hear me loud on your radio/
Tryna make you understand what you already know/

It really pays to be up and doing (ooohh ahh ahhh...)
No dulling, no slacking/ let's get busy, time and time again/
'cos Oluwa is involved eh....

VERSE 3
See it ain't my fault that i rhyme hardcore (not at all)/
This is what i did from the days back before/
And all what fellas do is ask me for more/
Like i got rap shit locked up in my store/

'cos when u feel my shit, its like a blow in the jaw (that's right)/
Or like your bones being cut with a sharp hacksaw (uhn uhnn..)/
Beeg Phait stands alone to face all y'all/
And y'all fellas ain't ashamed of shutting that door/

A good cook with good looks, i got them all (that's right)/
A hot juke with right beats, they wanna ball (oh yeah)/
Rake in cool dough, they all gon' fall (come on)/
They wan touch me, bodyguards form a wall/

Look me very well, you know me before/
You use to treat me like i was an eyesore/
When i start to buss' , you say i no get future/
All these things you saying, what you saying them for?!!/
