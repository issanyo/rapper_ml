[Intro]
[Teddy Riley]
I don't know what to do without you
I don't know what to do, do, do
I don't know what to do without you
You got me going in circles, circles, circles
Now that my love is gone away from you...

[MJB]
Oh...baby
(Whatcha gonna do) Baby
My, my, my love...hey

[Verse 1]
I was a fool to let you in
Knowing you would play with my heart
That was so long ago that I thought we could make a new start
You left me brokenhearted from the day your love departed
Now that love is by, I’m with someone new, it’s gone
And so you wanna come back

[Chorus]
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do without my love
(Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do, baby?)
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love has gone away from you?

[Verse 2]
Sweet memories of yesterday when it all seemed so right
I was loving you, kissing you, holding you tight
I wish you’d known that woman that you learned to leave today
And it’s a shame that you wanna come back now, baby
My love is gone away

[Chorus]
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do without my love
(My love is gone, yeah)
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love has gone away from you?

[Verse 3]
I’ve played the fool for ya, baby
And you stole away my heart
(Whatcha gonna do)
Now that my love has gone away
(Whatcha gonna do)
Sweet memories of yesterday
(Whatcha gonna do)
Now that my love has gone away

[Rap: Heavy D]
Now call me crazy but I woulda thought that you were diggin’ me
You didn’t think that you’d considered that Heavy D that kinda way
But I was reaching for an unreachable star
But then you told me you’re star no matter who you are
So here’s the plan, I’ll be your man, you’ll be my honey lamb
Two birds of a feather flock together, we look good together, that’s what they say
Anyway, here’s what I say, I’ll make you scream and shout
That’s what it is all about, so tell me what you’ll do without…
My love

[Chorus]
My love, my love
Whatcha gonna do without my love
(Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do)
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love has gone away from you?

Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love has gone away from you?

Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
(I’ve played the fool for you, baby)
Whatcha gonna do without my love
(Now that my love has gone away, whatcha gonna do?)
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love has gone away from you?

Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
(Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do)
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love has gone away from you?

[Interlude: MJB + (Teddy Riley)]
Now that my love has gone away from you
Now that my love has gone away from you
(What can I do without you?)
Now that my love has gone away from you
(What can I do without you?)
(What can I do without you?)
Now that my love has gone away from you
(What can I do without you?)
(What can I do without your love?)

[Refrain 7X: Heavy D]
Nuttin’ but love for ya, baby
I got nuttin’ but love for ya, honey
Hear me now

Hear me now (Repeat 4X)

[Outro: MJB + (Heavy D)]
Now that my love has gone away from you
(Hear me now)
Now that my love has gone away from you
(Hear me now)
Now that my love has gone away from you…
