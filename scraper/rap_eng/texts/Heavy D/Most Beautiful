(Pam)
When my eyes met your eyes
I knew from the day
A moment you will never regret
Maybe tonight will be so right
For me and you

You're so beautiful

Bridge (Keisha)

All my life I stood by
(Just standin' all alone without no one to call my own)
Then you came by and changed my life
(Now dancin' cause you gave me a heart to call home)

Chorus

What you are to me
Is everything I need
As far as I can see
The most beautiful...

What you are to me
Is everything I need
As far as I can see
The most beautiful...

(Pam)
Finally you started to touch me
And you made it rise, ooh you made it rise
My body started to go (round and round)
Into over-drive, you got me high

You're so beautiful

Bridge (Keisha)

All my life, I stood by
(Just standin' all alone, without no one to call my own)
Then you came by, and changed my life
(Now dancin', cause you gave me a heart to call home)

Chorus

What you are to me
Is everything I need
As far as I can see
The most beautiful...

What you are to me
Is everything I need
As far as I can see
The most beautiful...

What you are to me
Is everything I need
As far as I can see
The most beautiful...

What you are to me
Is everything I need
As far as I can see
The most beautiful...

(Keisha)
You are
Beautiful
Yes you are
Beautiful

You are
Beautiful
Yes you are
Beautiful

You are
Beautiful
Yes you are
Beautiful
