[Intro - Flavor Flav]
Y-Y-Y-Y-you're blind, baby
You're blind, baby!
You're blind from the facts

[Verse 1: Heavy D]
In comes, what comes another humdrum
Diddy-dum-drum
Some young bum got stung
One, two, three, four, five, six
Hard as the Heavy hits
Comin' with bag of tricks and pretty chicks
In control of my whole stroll
Know I got 'nuff soul
A brother got bold, but he dug a hole
Instead of a victory, he got evicted, B
I'm not pressed, I'm on a Peaceful Journey
Lock like a padlock, gotta make ya head bop
Not Fred Flintstone, but I make ya bed rock
Rock to a rhythm, hell is what I give 'em
I'm really sick and tired of the isms skizzisms
So check microphone
Check microphone
Check it out
Hev's got the honeys
That the brothers love to talk about
Skeeze me
(What)
Tease me
(What)
Do a dime please me
Rub-a-dub-dub, it ain't easy
Flex if you're flexin', sex if you're sexin'
Things are going on in the Heavy D section
Microphone check one
Microphone check two three
You can't see what I can see

[Hook]
You can't see what I can see
(You're blind, baby, You're blind from the facts)
You can't see what I can see
(You're blind, baby, You're blind from the facts)
You can't see what I can see
(You're blind, baby, You're blind from the facts)
You can't see what I can see
(You're blind, baby, You're blind from the facts)

[Verse 2: Heavy D]
Here I go, here I go, here I go again then
With a grin-grin
I might bag Rin Tin Tin
Emergency run run, dial 911
The H-to the E-to the A- to the V- to the Y
Wants a honeybun
Yes I am, yes I am, the big belly man
Hot damn, here I am with the mic in my hand
Abracadabra-ic, silk my favorite fabric
Hun had fun, she was done, reading Moby Dick
Me and my crew played a game called Flipper
When we come around
You better tighten up your zipper
I'll rip shreds in bed, Jack the Ripper
Yes I drink Coke, but I'm not a coke sniffer
Mac daddy-o, on the patio
Sippin' tea with Sweet'n'Low
When I lay low, they holler
"Where'd he go?"
Hev says peace to Big Kev in the barbershop
Can't forget Mike, Faze-O, and Scott
Twist and turn, long and yearn
You had your turn, now it's my turn
Microphone check one
Microphone check two three
You can't see what I can see

[Hook]
You can't see what I can see
(You're blind, baby, You're blind from the facts)
You can't see what I can see
(You're blind, baby, You're blind from the facts)
You can't see what I can see
(You're blind, baby, You're blind from the facts)
You can't see what I can see
(You're blind, baby, You're blind from the facts)

[Verse 3: Heavy D]
Yes, on a smooth tip, the Overweight Lover
I'm on ya radio and on ya magazine cover
Drink Coca-Colo, remain the rhyme solo
Like fancy clothes
So once in a while, I sport the Polo
Drinks on the house
There's a stunt on the couch
With a blunt in her mouth
Check it out, check it out
Peace to all the Nubian sisters, who be in
Twists and turns and Uptown doobiens
Follow the leader
I got the fever
I'm burnin up like a heater
Microphone check one
Microphone check two three
You can't see what I can see

[Hook]
You can't see what I can see
(You're blind, baby, You're blind from the facts)
You can't see what I can see
(You're blind, baby, You're blind from the facts)
You can't see what I can see
(You're blind, baby, You're blind from the facts)
You can't see what I can see
(You're blind, baby!)
