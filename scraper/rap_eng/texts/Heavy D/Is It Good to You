Is it good to you?
Is it good to you?
Is it good to you?
Is it good to you?

[Verse 1: Tammy Lucas]
When my love comes down
I don't have to run around
I've got you and you know just what to do
To fulfill all my needs and satisfy me

[Pre-Hook 1]
But I'd like to know
If the sexual healing is mutual
Do you feel what I'm feeling?
Do I please you? Do I fill the need?
I know I might sound bold
But I'd just like to know

[Hook (w/ Tammy Lucas)]
Is it good to you? (I want to know)
Is it good to you? (Ooh, I got to know, yeah)
Is it good to you? (Come on and tell me, boy)
Is it good to you?

[Verse 2: Tammy Lucas]
Ooh, don't be afraid
When we're making love, come on and say
Tell me just how you like it
I'll talk dirty to you, baby, while you drive me crazy

[Pre-Hook 2]
And I'd like to know
If that sexual healing is mutual
Do you feel what I'm feeling?
All my love's for you
All this love is true
And I'll never let you go
But I just got to know

[Hook (w/ Tammy Lucas ad-libs)]
Is it good to you? (I want to know)
Is it good to you? (Ooh, I got to know, yeah-yeah)

Is it good to you? (You got me singing

I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it

[Middle 8]
And I'd like to know
If that sexual healing is mutual
Do you feel what I'm feeling?

All this love is true
