[Intro: Puff Daddy]
You see, what I do, is, I try to make you dance, you know?
When you hear this, that, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I try to make you go to the dance floor, and, you know
Listen to my girl Missy say something like, come on, uh

[Missy Elliott + (Puff Daddy)]
I'mma stick closer to your side than a beeper
You Don't Have To Worry 'bout me, and you won't +Miss+ me like +Monifah+ (Heh, heh)
P-U-F-F (uh-huh), D-A-double D-(that's right)-Y
You be makin' hits like the old factory (Why, thank you)
And I..."Hit You With Da Hee"
Hee-hee-hee-hee-how
"Hit You Wit Da Hee"
This is how I get down, alright?
With Ronnie, Bobby, Johnny, Ricky, and Mike
(Don't forget about Ralph)

[Bobby Brown]
Lady, I know I've been acting strange
It seems to me you're tired of playing games
I've been around, had girls here and there
I did you wrong, but I'll give my life to make it right

[Hook]
I know that things ain't right
Seems like all we do is fight (OWWW!!!)
And it's been on my mind
You Don't Have To Worry
I'm gonna make it right
I'll be on your side
No more lonely nights
You Don't Have To Worry
(This is the remix, come on)

[Verse 2]
What must I do to make it up to you?
What can I say, to make you see things my way?
I know it's hard for you to understand
I did you wrong but I'll give my life to make it right

[Hook 2X]
I know that things ain't right
Seems like all we do is fight (OWWW!!!)
And it's been on my mind
You Don't Have To Worry
I'm gonna make it right
I'll be on your side
No more lonely nights
You Don't Have To Worry

[Bridge]
Don't be afraid
I'll be there whenever you need me
I'll be there trust in me
Just call on me
I won't let you down...ohhhh..

[Michael Bivins]
NE expertise, please
Here to put the squeeze on the industry fleas getting cheese
Peep these, butter slurs, his & hers
Chinchilla furs, check the Goodfella words
You don't ever have to worry
Cause I get in ya like Murray
And boo, it's only a tight flurry
You're frontin' cattin', you wanna rumble in the satin
In a bad ass suite somewhere in Lower Manhattan

[Ron DeVoe]
I'm from the street too but I gotta eat too
Won't hesitate to eat you, other than that "glad to meet you"
I spend nights in the Ramada, my honey's stay laced in Escada
Chickens is mad that I got her
Casino style, Gambino type smile
Kiss you before I twist you, on the wax is official
Players on the set, gettin' wet
Sippin' Perrier Jouet, so you don't even have to worry yet

[Hook 4X]
I know that things ain't right
Seems like all we do is fight
And it's been on my mind
You Don't Have To Worry
I'm gonna make it right
I'll be on your side
No more lonely nights
You Don't Have To Worry
