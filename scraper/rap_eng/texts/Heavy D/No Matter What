[Intro: Heavy D]
Ting called!!! I don't know why yuh feel like
You're not special, and you are
Yeah! Oh oh!

[Verse One: Heavy D]
Let's go back to the stars
In case you've been forgetting how beautiful you are
And some how, it seems, you think, that your look is no beauty queen
But I see ya, differently girl, and your everything I need
Cause I never knew what love was didn't know what love does
Until you did it to me

[Chorus: Heavy D] (Background Singers)
No matter what (No matter what) No matter what (No matter what)
I'm gonna be here, no matter what (No matter what)
As long as the world turns, you'll have my love girl
No matter what, no matter what, no matter what

[Verse Two: Heavy D]
Days when I'm stressed girl, you make it easier
When I'm on the road day after day I'm kissing her
Visions of kissing her, romance love dancing her
Is the best place I've been
I don't see you, differently girl, your still beautiful to me
Cause I never knew what love was didn't know what love does
But then you did it for me

[Chorus: Heavy D] (Background Singers)
No matter what (No matter what) No matter what (No matter what)
I'm gonna be here, no matter what (No matter what)
As long as the world turns, you'll have my love girl
No matter what, no matter what
No matter what (No matter what) No matter what (No matter what)
I'm gonna be here, no matter what (No matter what)
As long as the world turns, you'll have my love girl
No matter what, no matter what, no matter what

[Bridge: Heavy D]
The love that I had for you will never fade away
No no my love, no no my love
The love that I had for you it will never change
No no my love, no no my love
The love that I had for you will never fade away
No no my love, no no my love
The love that I had for you it will never change
No no my love, no no my love

[Chorus: Heavy D] (Background Singers)
No matter what (No matter what) No matter what (No matter what)
I'm gonna be here, no matter what (No matter what)
As long as the world turns, you'll have my love girl
No matter what, no matter what
No matter what (No matter what) No matter what (No matter what)
I'm gonna be here, no matter what (No matter what)
As long as the world turns, you'll have my love girl
No matter what, no matter what, no matter what
