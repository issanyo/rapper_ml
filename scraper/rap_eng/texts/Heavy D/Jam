[Verse 1]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t too much
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam
It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t, don't you
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam

[Verse 2]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She pray to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I've found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

[Hook]
Jam
It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t too much
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam
It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t, don't you
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam

[Verse 3: Heavy D]
Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man cause Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door, 3 and 4's in a bundle
Execute the plan, first I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
Cause it aren’t too hard to

[Hook]
Jam
It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t too much
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam
It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t, don't you
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam
