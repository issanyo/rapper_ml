[ VERSE 1: Heavy D ]
Poetically inclined, put in good order
I keep a party filled like a bucket of water
When Heavy's in the house, all the girls go crazy
Fellas that are jealous say, "Man, you amaze me!"
But all you need is the secret I keep
You grab a girl, gain some weight so she can squeeze the beat
Say "Hey good lookin" with the sweetest position
"Get inside the car so I can crank the ignition
You got some trouble, I handle him fo' ya
We cruise around in my BMW"
You got to have the voice to make the people jumpy
I'm proud to say I got it this way, I'm chunky but funky

[ VERSE 2: Heavy D ]
Man, I stand as a man, mixin music with noise
And every show that I go I bring along (The Boyz)
I'm 6 foot 2, a half a inch from 3
Don't need to tease, come on and squeeze MC Heavy D
Because I love to party, stronger than Bacardi
Walk down the street, I don't need a body-guardy
Eddie F is rippin, The Boyz are hop-hippin
My mind designs the rhyme, Heavy D, I do the lippin
Once I get ready my rhymes remain steady
Of course I get support from the crowd.. (Go Heavy!)
I demand of opposition, get ready to fly
I keep you dwellin till you ask me why
I'm chunky but funky

I am chunky but funky

[ VERSE 3: Heavy D ]
Strong like an ox, sly and slick like a fox
Takin all MC's, knock em out the box
I'm an overweight lover, got loots and cute
Take a girlie to the crib and knock all the boots
I'm strengthly stronger, I can last longer
Perfectly pleasin party people performer
Cold gettin paid is the way I live
You said I'm wack (sit down) you know what time it is
Suckers bow down to the rhymes I wrote
All you ducks on dope is good enough to smoke
It's guaranteed like Bruce Lee to kick the party alive
When I enter the club elders run and hide
]From this overweight attractive, hold the crowd captive
On the microphone I'm so damn active
MC Heavy D poetically jammin
To this beat that you keep demandin
Rhymes and more, cause you came for
The Overweight Lover, raw to the core
Designin and rhymin, flyin and climbin
To the top where stars are shinin
Beat conductor, rhyme constructor
Like sandpaper, but a whole lot rougher
Voice so smooth to keep the people jumpy
Yo Boyz (yo) tell em what I am: (he's chunky but funky)

[ VERSE 4: Heavy D ]
The gear that I wear is perfectly fitted
Rappin is my life and to it I am committed
Poetically inclined as a master with the rhyme
Like a typical word I'm hard to define
When I'm on the tape people stop at attention
Stuck like a truck in the mud when I mention
Things in a rhyme that they can't find
Jump up from the seat, run to the rewind
Button and press just to make sure
Call all your boys and they want more
You all agree that the jam's not sloppy
The crowd be up and say (yo, can we get jumpy?)
I'm chunky but funky

(He's chunky but funky)
