Our Father, Who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
On Earth as it's in Heaven

Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us

Lead us from temptation, deliver from evil
For thine is the kingdom
Power and glory
Forever and ever, Amen

I love you uncle Heavy
