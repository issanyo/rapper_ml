[Intro]
You can't just be materialistic, you can't just throw yourself around
You can't just want a person for an item, or for, or because, he's better than another person in some way
You, I mean, you know, nobody's foolish about how it is now, I mean, we're not kids
We all know what could be done to make things better, and um…
Just respect themselves more

Yeah, uh
No need to worry, yeah
Check it

[Chorus: Backup singers & Heavy D]
Slow down, yeah, baby gonna take your time
No need to worry
You don't have to worry about nothin' baby, 'cause everything will be just fine
Slow down, yeah, baby gonna take your time
Ayy, check it, no need to worry
You don't have to worry about nothin' baby, 'cause everything will be just fine
Bust it

[Verse 1]
Ayo, no need to flex, no need to rush, I'm not budgin'
Too much of a man and you should understand I need your lovin'
Don't worry about the he-say, she-say, it's all about the we-say
My immediate ingredient for a better day
And I'd, like to, thank you, for bein'
A part of my life, my future wife, and all the woman I'm needin'
So when they start to talk you should walk, don't even sweat it
'Cause they don't understand who's the man they'll never get it
So skip all the riff-riff, it's all about this miss
To me you're the one who's on everybody's wish list
And daddy never raised no fools, I know the haps
If you need me, I got your back, you know where I’m at
No need to worry

[Chorus: Backup singers & Heavy D]
Slow down, yeah, baby gonna take your time
Yeah,  no need to worry
You don't have to worry about nothin' baby, 'cause everything will be just fine
Aw, check it, no need to worry
Slow down, yeah, baby gonna take your time
You don't have to worry about nothin' baby, 'cause everything will be just fine
Bust it

[Verse 2]
Now if I had a choice, I'd never choose to lose you
Or try to confuse you, make a move to bruise you
Never front the funk, like a champ, that move's for chumps
And I don't need to chase, because I got just what I want
So honey dry your teardrops, I don't deal with flip-flops
'Cause flops just flip and when they flip they never stop
Point in case, this girl named Trace
A real pretty face but in the head she was a nutcase
So I'd just rather be without, wonderin' who and what's about
And I don't follow folks, 'cause folks just run their mouth
And I'll never push for the jabberjaw
Yack-yick-yick-yack, I got your back, you know where I’m at
There's no need to worry

[Chorus: Backup singers & Heavy D]
Slow down, yeah, baby gonna take your time
You don't have to worry about nothin' baby, 'cause everything will be just fine
No need to worry
Slow down, yeah, baby gonna take your time
You don't have to worry about nothin' baby, 'cause everything will be just fine
No need to worry
Slow down, take your time
Don't you worry baby
No need to worry
Things'll be just fine
Baby won't you take your time
Don't you worry baby, 'cause everything will be just fine

[Verse 3]
Yo, whoever told you this, whoever told you that is buggin'
They're mad 'cause I'm the dad and I'm the one gettin' the lovin'
Jealousy and envy, frontin' like they're friendly
Pretending to be somethin' they're not, really 'fends me
Like I told you before, don't worry I got it handled
And this is me and you and all of that's for all of them
My Nubian princess, ignore all the nonsense
Forget about the past tense, it's all about the present tense
I keep myself on the swift tip, God gave me a gift tip
Keep it in perspective, I never flip
Poppa never raised no fools, we know the haps
If you need me, I got your back, you know where I’m at
No need to worry

[Chorus: Backup singers & Heavy D]
Slow down, yeah, baby gonna take your time
No need to worry
You don't have to worry about nothin' baby, 'cause everything will be just fine
No need to worry
Slow down, yeah, baby gonna take your time
No need to worry
You don't have to worry about nothin' baby, 'cause everything will be just fine
Slow down, yeah, baby gonna take your time
You don't have to worry about nothin' baby, 'cause everything will be just fine
