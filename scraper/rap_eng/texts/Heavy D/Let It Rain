Artist: Heavy D
Album: Peaceful Journey
Song: Let it Rain

I don't wanna go outside
I just wanna be with you
I don't feel like takin' a ride
You know what I wanna do
Girl you makin' me sweat
Come close
Let's see how far we can get
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain
Let it rain

---------

Let it rain
Honey pop the umbrella
The heavster goes down smooth as ?
Fingers keep twiddlin'
But I'll keep drizzlin'
Play like a fiddle and
Here to move a million plus
Cause when I'm damp i don't rust
Girls make a fuzz
For the lover they lust
Nature takin' it's course
So precise
Provin' Heavy D can strike more than twice
Pronto
Snuggle
Better yet
Cuddle
Happy like a little kid
Playin' in a puddle
Of H2O
A drip drop ?
So figure I'm somewhere
Makin' a rainbow shine
With an intend to broaden
The quiet storm
That lurks more often
So lay with the lover
Snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain

(CHORUS)

Now we can go down stairs
Strike a match to the log
Let the fir Place burn
Dim the lights till it's dawn
Don't worry honey
I'll take good care of ya
I know what I'm doing
I get wrecked on a regular
Red light
Green light
One Two Three
Hey Yo Who's on the mic
Well it's me Heavy D
And I become somewhat of a national figure
You see some are big but the heavster is bigger
And I like candy bars with nuts
And ippy dippy girls
With prodigious butts
So lay with the lover
Snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain

(CHORUS)

Okey Dokey
Lookin' for a trophy
Giggolo, Romeo
Wrong category
More the dawn one type
Smooth like preacher
Your highschool teacher
Just call me your daddy O
Loungin' on the padio
Actin' like a kid
But drive a jeep
Not a caddy though
Pardon me Miss
In your high heel steps
Come inside the crib set
Befor you get wet
Now just for prop
Let's keep this official
Heavy is the name
D is the initial
I love the way you strut in that suit from France
There's a party tonight
Would you like to dance
You're rollin with the Lover
So be sure you dress clever
I pick you up at eight
And my drops off whatever
All of a sudden
I got the tingle fro a twinkie
Fever, flavor for a pringle
I think I like to mingle
With somebody thick
Someone that I can cling to
A milk chocolate beauty
Someone that I can sing to
You got the makings of a rainy day girl to me
So come a little closer
Let's see
How it would be

(CHORUS)

Lightning and Thunder
Kinda makes you wonder
Not too bad
For a brotha who's the son
Of a father who's a tech
And a mother who's a nurse
And I get paid
Cause I learned to kick a verse
I'm on a roll
I got 'nough control
Who needs a grammy
When you know you got soul
I'm a smooth
Yella
Complexion
Vanilla
High Low
Aphro
Intelligent fella
You look worried
Does something trouble ya
We can take a ride in my
Heavy D M W
But let's wait till the rain stops
So you can
Gimme what you want
And show me what you got
But for now
Just snuggle me Snuggle me
Quit the chit chat
Double up and snuggle oven me
You got the makings of a rainy day girl to me
So come a little closer
Let's see how it would be
