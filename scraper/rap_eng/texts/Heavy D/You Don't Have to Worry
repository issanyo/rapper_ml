Turn me up yo
That's right
New Edition
(You don't have to worry)

Chorus:
I know that things ain't right
Seems like all we do is fight
And it's been on my mind
You don't have to worry
I'm gonna make it right
I'll be by your side
No more lonely nights
You dont' have to worry

Verse 1 - Bobby
Lady, I know I've been acting strange
It seems to me, you're tired of playing games
I've been around, had girls here and there
I did you wrong, but I'll give my life to make it right

Chorus:
I know that things ain't right
Seems like all we do is fight
And it's been on my mind
You don't have to worry
I'm gonna make it right
I'll be by your side
No more lonely nights
You don't have to worry

Verse 2 - Bobby
What must I do, to make it up to you?
What can I say, to make you see things my way?
I know it's hard for you to understand
I did you wrong, but I'll give my life to make it right

Chorus:
I know that things ain't right
Seems like all we do is fight
And it's been on my mind
You don't have to worry
I'm gonna make it right
I'll be by your side
No more lonely nights
No more
You don't have to worry

Bridge - Ralph:
Don't be afraid, oh
I'll be there whenever you need me
I'll be there, trust in me
Just call on me
I won't let you down oooh

Rap - Mike:
N.E. expertise please
Here to put the squeeze on the
Industry fleas
Getting cheese, peep these, butter
Slurs, his & hers
Chinchilla furs, check the goodfella words
You don't ever have to worry
Cause I get in ya like Murry
And Boo, it's only a light flurry
You're frontin' cattin', you wanna
Rumble in the satin
In a bad ass suite somewhere in lower Manhattan

Rap - Ronnie
I'm from the street too
But I gotta eat too
Won't hesitate to eat you
Other than that, glad to meet you
I spend nights in the Ramada
My honey's stay laced in Escada
Chickens is mad that I got her
Casino style, gambino type smile
Kiss you before I twist you
All the wax is official
Player's on the set, gettin' wet
Sippin' Perrier-Jouet
So you don't even have to worry, yet

Chorus: (2X adlib over)
