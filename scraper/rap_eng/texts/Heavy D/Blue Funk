[Intro]
God gave me a gift, to put people at ease
What I do is, what I do
If I was to sit down and try to tell you, break it down, you know technically, I couldn't
Because I don't know, and that's the God's honest truth
What I do, is what I do, I hear a beat, I feel it, I write it, I say it

[Chorus: Backup singer & Heavy D]
Check it
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
A bag of blue funk
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
A bag of blue funk
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
A bag of blue funk
Kick it

[Verse 1]
Hear me out, I got thump in my trunk
That's all I really need and a bag of blue funk
Although I may be high profile, I keep a low pro style
Stay calmly, but my homies kinda wild
Mostly on the down low, now and then I hit a disco
Sport suits, drink milk, never Cisco
I read the funnies, watch Bugs Bunny cartoons
And at my crib I dig Bob Marley-ah tunes
I take a spin in my Lexus coupe, sportin' sexy suits
Sippin' sick, I sip chicken soup
I rip stages like a maniac, lyrics like a maniac
And shows get torn no matter where we at
A little bit more than better, I warm it up like a sweater
A money generator, fly honey dip getter
Like I said before, thump in my trunk
That's all I really need and a bag of blue funk

[Chorus: Backup singer & Heavy D]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
A bag of blue funk (blue funk)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
A bag of blue funk (blue funk)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
A bag of blue funk (blue funk)

[Verse 2]
Here comes the kid, can you dig, I got the flavor
If you don't believe me, just check with your neighbor
I get 'nough respect, from the roughest roughneck
And I'm wicked and unruly when it comes to a mic check
Drive a Jeep, catch beeps on the norm
Never say much when I riff 'cause I'm a quiet storm
Most of the time I'm coolin' in my crib, watchin' cable
And I got crazy hoodies, far from dummies in my stable
I'm well known in my hood, like a gangsta
When the time is right, I'd like to have a little Heav-ster
I bust riffs, that'll incite the dead
And beats that make you stagger like the neighborhood wine-head
I warm it up like a heater, or a funky, funky drummer beater
Brown sugar is sweeter [?] my [?]
Like I said before, thump in my trunk
That's all I really need and a bag of blue funk

[Chorus: Backup singer & Heavy D]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
A bag of blue funk (blue funk)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
A bag of blue funk (blue funk)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
A bag of blue funk (blue funk)

[Verse 3]
In the morning time I wake up with the sun, that's how I get up
When I walk the streets alone, when I'm far from home, I keep my head up
Don't swing with many strangers, 'cause to me that's just a setup
If you're pushin' up too close, I might be ghost and you'll get wet up
Not into showin' off, because I'm not the show off type
I'd rather take my time, writin' rhymes and blowin' up mics
Kill, just max, make loot pay tax
On the ladies blow kisses, on the gents, tip hats
I like to swing with girls, 'cause to me it's a ton of laughs
But after the gig is past, we on to take bubble baths
I was raised well, but now I raise hell
It's hard to make a livin' so now I'm livin' swell
I never have a problem in the streets I'm too smooth for that
I never talk or walk with a gun, but run my crew with straps
Like I said before, thump in my trunk
That's all I really need and a bag of blue funk

[Chorus: Backup singer & Heavy D]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
A bag of blue funk (blue funk)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
A bag of blue funk (blue funk)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
A bag of blue funk (blue funk)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
A bag of blue funk (blue funk)

Nuff respect, to all the funk brothers, y'all know who you are
Yeah, ya hear me man, big up all y'all
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Manhattan, Mount Vernon, Uptown
Yeah
