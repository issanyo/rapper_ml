[Intro: Heavy D & (Brandy)]
Uh (oh yeah)
Bring the funk Q
Big Heav in the house, I'm saying for the 9 pound
Yeah, get down
Talk about it, huh (umm mh)
Check this out, original (oh oh oh)
Keep it movin' and you don't stop
Love the way we do the hip hop
Oh yeah, like this
Check it (oh whoah oh)

[Verse 1: Heavy D & (Quincy Jones)]
Ayo, rock you, I got you, true that, now who that?
Where Q at? (Right here) I knew that
The Juke Joint, the new point for the funk fellas, cella dwellas
R&B and rap fanaticals, acrobaticals
Individuals, smooth criminals
Overweight lovable, huggable, snuggable D, that's me
H to the E to the A to the V to the Y
Brandy sweet like candy, get fly

[Brandy]
Boy, close your eyes
Let the rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothing that you can do, oh oh
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with my

[Pre-Chorus: Brandy]
You gotta feel that heat and we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus: Brandy]
I wanna rock with you (all the night)
Dance you into day (till the sunlight)
I wanna rock with you, baby baby (all the night)
Rock the night away

[Verse 2: Brandy]
Boy, out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Boy, oh when you dance, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love, oh ooh
Just take it slow
Uh, we got so far to go

[Pre-Chorus: Brandy]
When you feel that heat and we're gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus: Brandy]
I wanna rock with you (all the night)
Dance you into day (till the sunlight)
I wanna rock with you, baby baby (all the night)
Rock the night away

[Bridge: Brandy]
And when the groove is dead and gone (dead and gone)
You know that love survives and we can rock forever

[Heavy D]
Overseas fashion, my passion for hip-hop
Flock followers, I clock dollars and I rip spots
Make moves with smooth dudes like Q
Attract fly honeys with exotically moves and moneys
I can make it hotter, ask your daughter, I stay dipped
Freshly, so don't test me
You go 1, 2, 3 Heav' D's in the house
And I'm out - peace

[Chorus: Brandy]
I wanna rock with you (all the night)
Dance you into day (till the sunlight)
I wanna rock with you, baby baby (all the night)
Rock the night away
Rock with you (all the night)
Dance you into day (till the sunlight)
I wanna rock with you, baby baby (all the night)
I wanna rock the night away
