Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
That's the kind of girl I need down with my team
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
That's the kind of girl I need down with my team
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
That's the kind of girl I need down with my team
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
That's just the way I like it

[Verse 1]
I need a girl who ain't scared to scrap
Someone who got my back
Gotta be a dark skin or light skin black
The type of girl that stays busy all day
But when the sun goes down, she's my sexy souffle (Hey)
Somebody real who ain't afraid to work
If you try to disrespect ya mess around and get ya feelings hurt
She ain't pressed from your ? ? ? ?
She'll only flex with a brother that can handle it
And I don't care if she's a little bit jealous
She can still be a lady while she's coolin' with the fellas
An intellectual, beautiful, sexual
Hands on her hip but when she flips she's incredible
Candlelight dinners from her man
But she's a trooper if she has to she'll eat beans from the can
A very nice girl but don't mistake her for no softy
And that's the way I like it
Yeah, my black coffee

[Hook]

Black coffee gotta fit like a mitten
Roars like a lion when I stroke her kitten
Versatile, wears the Colgate smile
She got the piles of style, ain't had none in a while
Party animal, but dig it, only when she's with me
And I don't have to worry 'cause she won't disrespect me
She's everything that a man dreams about
And when I'm with my crew, she's all I talk about (hey)
Fancy hair, jewels all flushed
Backside bigger than (her mom?) but don't touch her
Pretty skirt, you know the ones with the slit
A closet full of gear so you know she stay dipped
Body all smooth from using plenty lotion
Perfume smelling like some ol' sex potion
A nice girl but don't mistake her for no softy
And that's the way I want her
Yeah, my black coffee

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Break it down
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream

[Verse 3]
Black coffee, the African queen
Part of the Afro-American dream
'Nuff respect, I dig ya intellect
Appreciate the fact that you never miss a step
The backbone of the black home, here's to ya
As long as I'm around
Believe me, nuttin' could ever do ya
You're warm, considerate, and far from a softy
And that's why I love ya, you're my black coffee

[Hook]
