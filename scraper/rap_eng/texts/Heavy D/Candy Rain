[Chorus]
My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone
So much you thought you'd die?
Giving so much of yourself
It seems the only way
Tell me what you want and I
And I will give it to you
Cause you are

[Chorus]
My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain

[Verse 2]
My love, did you ever dream
That it could be so right?
I never thought that I would find
All that I need in life
All I want, all I need now, I know
I know I found it in you, I found it in you
Cause you are

[Chorus]
My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain
My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain
My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain

Candy coated raindrops
Candy coated raindrops

[Outro]
My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain
My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
