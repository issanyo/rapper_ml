The sun don't seem to shine on me no more
I find myself waitin' by the door
Things just ain't the same
Since you've been gone

So I kill time waitin' by the phone
Hopin' that you'll call or just come home
Your side of the bed is cold and I'm alone
So I called Mama and Mama said
"Son, let it go, move on"

"'Cause she's gone, yeah, she's gone
Oh she's gone, yeah, she's gone"
And I know, and I know
But what if Mama was wrong

At night I pace the floor and corridors
I'm a man of wealth but by myself I'm poor
So Lord, take this, take that
'Cause I can't take no more
She was all I'm livin' for

And now she's gone
There's all this emptiness inside my home
Her side of the bed is cold and I'm alone
So I called Mama and Mama said
"Son, let it go, move on"

"'Cause she's gone, yeah, she's gone
Oh she's gone, yeah, she's gone"
And I know, and I know

Please just move on
Life will still keep goin' on
It's time to let her go
It's time to let her go and move on

And she's gone, yeah, she's gone
Oh she's gone, yeah, she's gone
And I know, and I know
But what if Mama was wrong

And she's gone, yeah, she's gone
Oh, she's gone, yeah, she's gone
And I know, and I know

What if Mama's wrong
What if Mama's wrong
I know she's gotta be wrong
She's just comin' home again
