[Intro]
You are on my mind
You are on my mind
You are on my mind
You are on my mind

[Chorus]
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
The way I feel lately, it's driving me crazy
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
I can't get over you, I think about you all the time

[Verse 1]
Can't you see what you do to me
I think about you all the time
My mind is hazy and I'm mixed up feeling crazy over you
Let's not waste any time

[Chorus]
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
The way I feel lately, it's driving me crazy
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
I can't get over you, I think about you all the time

[Verse 2]
Round and round I go
Where I'll stop only you know
I guess it's all in my mind
Take your time, think it over
Let me know what you wanna do
Baby it's all good

[Chorus]
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
The way I feel lately, it's driving me crazy
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
I can't get over you, I think about you all the time

[Interlude]
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
You're on my mind, hey
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
You're on my mind, hey
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
You're on my mind, hey
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
You're on my mind, hey

[Chorus]
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
The way I feel lately, it's driving me crazy
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
I can't get over you, I think about you all the time

Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
The way I feel lately, it's driving me crazy
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
I can't get over you, I think about you all the time

Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
The way I feel lately, it's driving me crazy
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
I can't get over you, I think about you all the time

[Outro]
The way I feel lately, it's driving me crazy
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
You're on my mind, hey
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
You're on my mind, hey
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
You're on my mind, hey
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
You're on my mind, hey
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
You're on my mind, hey
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
You're on my mind, hey
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
You're on my mind, hey
Every little thing I do, you're on my mind
You're on my mind, hey
