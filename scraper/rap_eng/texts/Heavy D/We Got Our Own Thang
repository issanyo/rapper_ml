(Teddy Riley)
Yo man, you ready to drop this, man? (Yeah-eee)
Well kick it for me one time...

"Pass" (Drop it)

(Intro/Chorus - Teddy Riley (Heavy D.)
We got our own thaaaang ("Get up and do my thang")
We got our own thaaaang (A diddley-diddley-diddley-diddely-diddely-Deee)
We got our own thaaaang
We got our own thaaaang (We've got our own thang)

("Drop it")

We got our own thaaaang (A diddley-diddley-diddley-diddely-diddely-Deee)
We got our own thaaaang (A diddley-diddley-diddley-diddely-diddely-Deee)
We got our own thaaaang (A diddley-diddley-diddley-diddely-diddely-Deee)
We got our own thaaaang

(Heavy D.)
("HEY!") Every-body, shake your bo-dy
We don't ill, we chill at a party
Keep a groove that's sensual, three-dimensional
Unquestionable, the lover is professional
Got a category, my own and I'm the president
Don't be alarmed but it's holding up the resident
With my particular style, style particular
Extracurricular, smoother and trickier
Throwing on lyrics like you throw up a flapjack
You're a Chicken McNugget, and I'm a Big Mac
Brainstorm soloist, have a Coca-Cola and
Doing very well 'cause it took the right road to this -
Path! Make the under-take, the recordbreaker
Get up on the floor, do the "Heavy D shake-a"
Started with a pow, and I'ma end it with a BANG (yo..)
..we got our own thang

(Chorus)
(Heavy D.)
Picture the set, girlies wet with sweat
In the corner people sittin down they've had as much
As they could possibly get;
Meanwhile I'm lampin, feeling like a champ and
Push up on a cutie, phone digits I'm stampin (*echoes*)
The place was packed though, stuffed like an Oreo
Everybody broke for a Heavy D. video
Pumpin in stereo, people said, "Here we go"
A cutie down in front said, "Heavy, you're my hero"
Understand this, before you make a comment
Because there's always a meaning, in a Heavy D. statement
In this life, I strive for improvement
Be your own guide, follow your own movement (*echoes*)
Love is a legend, me I'm legendary at it
Flippin on the mike makes me a rappin acrobat
Don't try to swing, because you didn't even HANG (yo...)
..we got our own thang

(Chorus)
(DJ scratches "Heavy D.")

(Heavy D.)
Original, individual, smooth criminal
Dance a lot, dance a little, shuffle to the middle
Don't clock anybody, let 'em all clock you
Don't be down with anybody, let 'em all be down with you
Stay self-managed, self-kept, self-taught
Be your own man, don't be borrowed, don't be bought
Started with a pow and I'ma end it with a BANG (yo...)
..we've got our own thang

(Chorus 'til fade)
