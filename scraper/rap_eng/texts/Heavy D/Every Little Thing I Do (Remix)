[Chorus]
You're driving me crazy
Every little thing I do, you're...
You're driving me crazy
Every little thing I do, you're...
You're driving me crazy

[Verse: Chance The Rapper]
Now I'm a little too young to be drinkin' this much
I'm a little too dumb to be thinkin' this much

I was the [?], used to walk on my friends
Mind's made up, never been on the fence
So everybody in here textin' their friends
(Get the fuck off your phone!)
The people start dancin' and romancin'
