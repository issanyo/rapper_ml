Yeah, uh huh, yeah, huh (*echo*)

It's Tim and Maganoo again, uh
It's Tim and Maganoo again, ah, ah
It's Tim and Maganoo again
Let me talk to ya

[Verse 1 - Timbaland]
I remember those days when I was holdin back
When Star Crunch was a popular snack
Would you buy you that, sneak the rest in my nuts
You know that Johnny Appleseed and that frozen cup
We grew up, but ain't you sister Jean cousin (cousin)
Just cause we older that don't mean nothin (nothin)
We still could hit the beacon, a couple of Bible meetings
Live right just like the deacons and backslide on the weekend
Now things change, not just your new love
See you never used to trip off material stuff
So I ain't mad at dude cause he rimmed up his truck
Just mad at you, you clumsy klutz
And it's no suprise how I'm feelin inside
So the only thing you ever probably did for my eye
Used to tears in the bucket, I hope you dummies loved it
Although it's over, you still my soldier (my soldier)

[Hook - Timbaland]
Cause I got love for ya
Can I get a hug from ya?
I'm not tryna point the finger and judge ya
Cause I make mistakes like you
I forgive ya boo
You can keep the things that I brought ya
I'm not tryna play correctional officer
I'm just tryna take them burdens off of ya
Cause I make mistakes like you
I forgive ya boo

[Verse 2 - Magoo]
I first met ya at the strip club
Instead of one, had to give ya two dubs
Right from sight baby, I was past love
It must be the fact, opposites attract
Do the addition, it's a one on one thing, and I'mma lace you with bling
Cause the way you make me feel is an incredible thing
But you had to hurt me, made love to my best friend
But just like "Chucky" I'mma stay 'til the very end
On top of that, you was usin crack and cocaine
You had oomph, had to throw my towel in mayn
I can't judge cause I cheated, you ain't hold no grudge
I had a child with her, baby it's warm in love
Then Christmas Eve we was playin two hand spades
You rolled on up, Ace I'm sorry but I have AIDS
But I'mma ride with you, until your death
And I'mma stay by your side, last heartbeat, last breath

[Hook]

[Break - Timbaland]
I hope ya forgive me too, uh
I hope ya forgive me too (too), uh
I hope ya forgive me too (too)
Be adults about the situation baby, c'mon

[Hook]

[Timbaland - talking over Hook]
Can I?
Go head
Uh uh

[Break - Timbaland]
I hope ya forgive me too, uh
I hope ya forgive me too (too), uh
I hope ya forgive me too (too)
Two wrongs don't make a right, girl, uh
Two wrongs don't make a right, girlll
Oo, oo, let's ride out
Let me talk to 'em
Let me talk about it
Heavy T, Oo we right, we out
