INTRO
Yo whassup lovey doveys/
This is a Hip-Hop song i had to do for you guys/
Talks about the way i feel...

CHORUS
Soldier, Soldier won't you marry me with your musket, fife and drum (won't you marry me)/
How can i marry such a beautiful Ma when i gat no wheels to roll on (yah yah)/
I say Soldier, Soldier won't you marry me with your musket, fife and drum (won't you marry me, won't you marry me yeah... yeah...)

VERSE 1
Pretty Ma, no know where she from/
Talking to me, thought she got tipsy drinking rum/
But all i could see was this Ma chewing gum/
Then she beckoned on me, baby boy please come/

Here i am, any problem i could solve/
Oh boy you look like that dove flying up above/
Hearing you sing, i already fall in love/
Then she pop the question wey i never hear before/

CHORUS
Soldier, Soldier won't you marry me with your musket, fife and drum (won't you marry me)/
How can i marry such a beautiful Ma when i gat no wheels to roll on (yah yah)/
I say Soldier, Soldier won't you marry me with your musket, fife and drum (won't you marry me, won't you marry me yeah... yeah...)

VERSE 2
Check her out, then you know she roll on dough/
But fuck her out, then you know you gon' be her foe/
In front of me, body moving so slow/
Then the next we did was turn the lights down low/

About to leave, this was like the next day/
Dressing up, was already on my way (C'mon)/
Suddenly, i heard a voice say/
Go think about what i said yesterday/

CHORUS
Soldier, Soldier won't you marry me with your musket, fife and drum (won't you marry me)/
How can i marry such a beautiful Ma when i gat no wheels to roll on (yah yah)/
I say Soldier, Soldier won't you marry me with your musket, fife and drum (won't you marry me, won't you marry me yeah... yeah...)

VERSE 3
Here i am, standing on my front porch/
'been knocking the door but my baby won't budge/
Dunno why she playing a lady judge/
I love you ma but you just don't know how much/

Please let me in and i'm gon tell you the whole story/
I met this girl, she said her name was glory/
Had a few drinks, the next we had was a orgy/
But please forgive me, 'cos i'm now very sorry/

CHORUS
Soldier, Soldier won't you marry me with your musket, fife and drum (won't you marry me)/
How can i marry such a beautiful Ma when i gat no wheels to roll on (yah yah)/
I say Soldier, Soldier won't you marry me with your musket, fife and drum (won't you marry me, won't you marry me yeah... yeah...)

BRIDGE
Then we head to a mall/ had the chance to pick all/
Then we giggled and we laughed on our way to ball/
{ Echo: Then we head to a mall/ had the chance to pick all/
Then we giggled and we laughed on our way to ball/}

Then we head to a mart, i saw cars look like cart/
Checked 'em out, test 'em out, settled for aston mart/
{ Echo: Then we head to a mart, i saw cars look like cart/
Checked 'em out, test 'em out, settled for aston mart/}

Then we head to a bank/ 'gat money full a tank/
Bada Boom, Bada Bing, met this guy called frank/
{ Echo: Then we head to a bank/ 'gat money full a tank/
Bada Boom, Bada Bing, met this guy called frank/}


CHORUS
Soldier, Soldier won't you marry me with your musket, fife and drum (won't you marry me)/
