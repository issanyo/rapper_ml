[Chorus]
It was written, up in the book of life
That man shall, endure forever more
And it was written, up in the book of life
That man shall, endure forever more

Well did you know the pen is stronger than the knife
They can kill you once but they can't kill you twice
Did you know destruction of the flesh
Is not the ending to life fear not of the Anti-Christ

Did you know that I exist before the earth
And did you know my eyes are windows to the world
Did you know you can't go a Zion and a wear Jerry curls
Can't tell the boys from the girls

Your bodies just a vehicle transporting the soul
It's what's inside people, is beauty to behold
Fear not of evil, every day dem flesh it grow old
Changes of the time take toll

[Chorus]
It is told that once this greasy order
Is form it comes into a young man's world
And two of dem is like a soldier
That joins the thunder is a wonder

One's attack is like a blunder
One is luckily a stranger
Dem both was born like Jesus inna manger
So join the thunder that's savin' our world

A vester on his chest and Rastafarian is his name
A gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain
Blessing that you all be got, lessons taught you all forgot
Rasta call I shit you not, do you remember Elijah
And his chariot of flames, same blood that runs through my veins

Watch for sticks and stones stumbling blocks and piles
Life is one big road miles on top of miles
So blessed be the soul that always remains a child
And most people don't even smile there's a natural mystic

Blowing in through the air so keep it realistic and always be aware
The truth is crying out and it's so loud and clear
But most people won't even hear spiritual pollution is in the atmosphere
And with so much confusion can one be happy here
The gift of Rastafari is for all man to share
But some would rather to be so unfair

[Chorus]
