Ha ha, yeah, Big Bub, nine seven
Yo Latifah, do you

[Queen Latifah]
We used to dream of a nice hot cruise for weeks
While my high sex drive rocks you to sleep
Watching mystic continuously
Your stock rose immediately when you was with me
You wanted the lace, the leather
Since the days I had the jetta
You chased the chedder
And like whatever we face and whether double ballers
They ain't no playa's till they saw us
Pushing the tall bus tell 'em we're twin porche's

[Big Bub]
Girl I am diggin you you're diggin me
Let's make this happen
The things I want to do to you
Your mind just can't imagine
I want to show you bigger faces
Take you diffent places
I need you in my life
So baby won't you be my lady

[Big Bub]
I want your love (yeah)
I need your love
I need you with me
I want your love (yeah)

Oh, baby

I'm on another level
Can't you see that I'm no player
Meet your desires, take you higher like an elevator
And here's the bottom line
No one can ever love you better
If you like what you're hearing
Girl let's get together

I want your love (oh yeah)

She said water bed I like when you inside of me
Cuz you belly all big and you so fly to me
Now shorty takes trips and various whips
Her phone flips likes style lavish
Playin' the cabin, word the mother
