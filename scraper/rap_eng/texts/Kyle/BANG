[Intro]
(Hey Kyle!)

[Chorus: Mr. Man & KYLE]
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
(Know what I'm saying)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
(We in the tweaking traphouse)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
(It's the fire spittin' kitten, cuz)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Kyle]
Skinny jeans, Chuck T's
Nigga like, "uh!"
K-i-does what the fuck I want
Dude, niggas like you?
Better than me?
Nigga like, huh? Wha?
Nineteen with a milli swag
Making white moms really glad
Whack rappers is really mad
Cause y'all suck like really bad!
Cassio on my wrist
Nigga time for me to get rad
I make this shit look gold
But nah nigga, this shit just brass
I'm a beast, I'm a beast
I'm a dog, I'm a dog
And I shut niggas down
And I'm not even on
If your shit sounds weak just hit up my phone
You need help with your songs, I'm the nigga you call

[Pre-Chorus: Kyle]
'Cause I bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Run these tracks, get hit with a train
Verse or hook cause I know how to sing, sing
Have your preteen goin' insane, 'sane
Lamborghini mercy
Your chick she so thirsty
I gave her a drink but, I don't think it's working
Blowing up my newsfeed, had my Twitter chirping
I see more of her than you, and I ain't met her in person

[Chorus: Mr. Man]
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang

[Verse 2: Mr. Man]
Uh, look, Mr. Man
Nigga damn
Where the fuck you been at, bruh?
I been up, banging on raps
Walking in show, making stages collapse
Nomore who is that, cause they know we are
Blowing on trees, fuck security guards
Touch Down and make the city ours
My hair nappy like a Rastafari
Stayed in my lane
Bringing that bang
Flow 16 keys of cocaine
Dreamed of gold chains around my neck
Big crib, a bunch of whips like slaves
Overcomers that overcame
Y'all balling on minimum wage
Never heard of your crew
Ain't red nor blue but my niggas we bang
Yup, yup, yup
Let me get back to it
Oh wow, you said I couldn't do it
Funny as fuck, are you dummies or what?
Cause I was gon' blow when you dumb niggas knew it

[Pre-Chorus: Kyle]
'Cause I bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Run these tracks, get hit with a train
Verse or hook cause I know how to sing, sing
Have your preteen goin' insane
Lamborghini mercy
Your chick she so thirsty
I gave her a drink but, I don't think it's working
Blowing up my newsfeed, had my Twitter chirping
I see more of her than you, and I ain't met her in person

[Chorus: Mr. Man]
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang

[Bridge]
Ridin' around in my city
And these niggas know what I'm 'bout
Pull up on a '60s bike that cost more than your house
Yeah, everybody outside
Hearing shit that I like
Got them speakers blaring
There ain't anywhere you can hide
Uh

[Chorus: Mr. Man]
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, biggity bang, bang
