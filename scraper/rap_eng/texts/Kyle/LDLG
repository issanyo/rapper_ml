*Chorus*

Long distance love girl
I feel you so far away
Long distance love girl
Sorry i couldn't stay x2

[Verse 1:Kyle/CP]

[Kyle] so i hit yo ass up on skype
And you didn't ever pick up
But it said you was online
It said you was online
And i said i would call you
Soon as i had alone time
But you turned off yo phone right
Left me all alone again
Left me on my own again
Left my heart so cold again
And striped away my soul again
I could text you, i could facetime, i could tweet
But every time i call you girl
I swear
All that shit ever does is
[CP] Ring, ring x4, ring, ([kyle] its me calling, its me calling) ring x4

*Chorus*

Long distance love girl
I feel you so far away
Long distance love girl
Sorry i couldn't stay x2
