[Verse]
Look my dad called like last week
So I picked up, and said "Hi Dad," he said fuck me
Well that's great
Gimme that bank, gimme that bass
Gimme that dream, gimme that race
Gimme that love, gimme that hate
Give me it straight, don't give me no chase
And give me that pain, give me that real
Give me that hurt so I know I can feel
Give me it all, give me it all
Give me them scars, I know I'll heal
Give me that cold, do me like winter
Freeze my soul, make it a chiller
You can kill my fucking spirit and all it's gon' do is just make me a killer
Killing these beats, killin' this game
Losing my feelings and gaining this fame
It seems like I lose a friend every time I gain to fame
And I hate the fact that I can't change my friends for who they are
It's just hard to see the beauty on a face that's full of scars
And it seems like you hate me for shit I never did
Well I'm sorry if the hand I was dealt was full of shit
All I knew was that I was down, don't know about her, don't know about them
I knew about me and I knew about you and I know it won't ever be happy again
Yeah

[Chorus]
Well I lost it all, and it's all my fault
Yeah I lost my love, shoulda lost my heart it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
My family's broken, my wounds is open
And my future's fading, yeah I lost my hope is
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
