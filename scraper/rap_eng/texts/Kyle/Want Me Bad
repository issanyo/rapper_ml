[Intro: Cousin Stizz]

[Hook: KYLE]
Yeah, yeah, want me bad

[Verse 1: KYLE]
They don't wanna see me love me no more
They don't wanna see me off the EBT
They don't want to see me feed the team no more, no
Look in they eyes, they tell me so many lies
They ain't got the shine, they ain't tryna see me with mine
Blinder, you got snakes in the grass, nigga, find 'em
Niggas never notice that the enemy they lookin' for is usually behind them, 'hind them
Opposition, nah, I don't mind 'em
They just wanna see me in the streets just like them
Feeding me the hate, saying, "Try some"
They don't wanna see me do what I've done, make it far as I've come, yeah

[Hook: KYLE]
Yeah, want me bad
I know they want me bad
I see 'em down and out
I know they want me, yeah
My team is on my back
Them demons on my ass
I know they want me bad
I know they want me bad
Yeah, yeah, want me bad
I know they want me bad
I see 'em down and out
I know they want me, yeah
My team is on my back
Them demons on my ass
I know they want me bad
I know they want me bad
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Cousin Stizz]
Yeah, we ain't even tryna deal the weed no more
They want my niggas in them handcuffs, they don't want us in the street no more
I ain't surprised, I'm on a high, they fall behind
Don't got the time, they'd rather shade you than get up and try
They ain't sayin' nothin' real, I done spent my whole life round the drug deal
All my old plugs tell me do the rap thing
I can live my whole life like they never will
I got holes in my heart that'll never fill
Long nights, long days, smoke up project hallways
Little boy, she check a boy, keep workin', I know I ain't perfect
Now I'm lookin' back like it was worth it

[Hook: KYLE]
Yeah, yeah, want me bad
I know they want me bad
I see 'em down and out
I know they want me, yeah
My team is on my back
Them demons on my ass
I know they want me bad
I know they want me bad
Yeah, yeah, want me bad
I know they want me bad
I see 'em down and out
I know they want me, yeah
My team is on my back
Them demons on my ass
I know they want me bad
I know they want me bad
Yeah, yeah
