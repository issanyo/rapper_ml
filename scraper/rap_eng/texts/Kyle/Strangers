Hook: see i know yo mama told yo ass not to talk to strangers

Verse
Have you ever took candy from strangers on the block
Where niggas know it's hot
Where you can go outside
And hope not to get pop
Needed just know you're rolling
Everybody know how you do it
Nigga whats your goal
Will you go sell your soul
Just for a lil money here and there
Nigga no my niggas know
Exactly what you want
Everybody say go to church
But he knows the bible to whats the worth
With every body preach ain't teaching to me
I don’t know what to do
So i try to take another sermon
Sit down and read the Bible by myself
I ain't trying to listen to nobody need no help
Thoughts of a young man in the system
Nigga get caught up with them
Living life like I'm living
Y'all nigga hate when I'm winning
Now nigga pay attention
Get back to the winner
My mega on the block tell me this for minute

Verse:
I'm like a everyday guy
Joe blow Joe know exactly what Joe did
To get home Fo show
Nigga get me another show so i can get up on the seen
So much green nigga so much green
Get my nigga my niggas off the block
Get my nigga out the cell buy my mama a house
Everything that she wanted damn
The nigga finally did it
Now the niggas on the block
Look at yo ass as food cuz you made to the top
Nigga this is how it is and this is how it goes
And everybody now exactly what they do it fo
Another show another day they show up to yo shows
Talking hella load but you can’t hearing not no
So they move to the front then move to the back
They yelling at the stage
Like nigga yeah you sack
Cuz you know what you did for the money and shit
Know what they tell you bout that shit
