December 25, naww I've been rapping before christmas/While ya'll making your wishes, formalatting your wish lists/
Im making sick hits, that make you drip and stop/
Even leave rudolph, with a sniffle and cough/
Red nose shine bright, i'll never get lost/
Santa does it every year, at whatever the cost/
A Green monster stealing christmas, thats colder than frost/
Jack gifts and ornaments, that all has to stop/
I got this gift so I rap, to unwrap the flow/
In North Pole, I shovel off like snow/
Jokes, like I can't fit down the chimney/
I lost a few pounds, so here I go/
In one night, I hit every home/
Ladies and gents its the saint Nick Show/
After I fill stockings, I have milk and dough/
Then share hersey kisses under mistle-toes/

Sharing is caring man, its just goodwill/
I can't imagine Noel, without No L/
O.V.E. Christmas will never stop/
Kyle got the evergreen flow, thats the star on top/
