Verse 1:
I chopped a girl named Demi, call me the butcher/
Demi wanted Moore so she went back Kutcher/
Forget, that broad she should notice me now/
It wasn't a matter of when, it was a matter of how/
See, I met another broad named Keisha/
She said she smoked sisha/
She said I'm a pleaser/
I learned she had a boyfriend and told him/
I can make your girl hit, hit more keys than Alycia/
Believe me, Really/
After me, i'll have your girl walking like Genie/
I told you everything is mine like chile/
Believe it or not, okay Mr. Ripley/
Watsup/

Chorus
You ain't ready for this man, you ain't ready for this/
This that deep, deep flow straight from the abyss/
You ain't ready for this

Verse 2:
I never really liked pepsi it wasn't up to par/
I much prefer coke like Escobar/
Broads hate on me cause I never call/
Blokes hate cause my money Robert wadlow tall/
Its like I'm King, I got rappers bowing down on one knee/
I would be surprised if they asked will marry me/
I got filling, a filling like a cavity/
I got a feeling, a feeling like the black eyed peas/
Don’t ask me no questions, just ask geeves/
I don’t bare arms, I wear long sleeves/
Geez, I told you Im Richie like Nicole/
Cause of my unforgettable flow that, Nat King Cole/
Its creeps on you, I told you I’m a lyricist/
Girl, don’t try and fight it like a pacifist/
Believe me, Eric Wright, its too Eazy/
Hitting broads like Chris Brezzy/
That's what's up/

Chorus
You ain't ready for this man, you ain't ready for this/
This that deep, deep flow straight from the abyss/
You ain't ready for this
