[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey real shit I'm fuckin' really fuckin' real

[Hook]
Lexicon, Lexi-lexicon
Skinny nigga but I bet that I'm still flexin' on
All about my green, like a fuckin' leprechaun
My suit up look mean, gold Casio on my arm

[Verse 1]
Flow is untouchable
A lot of niggas thinkin' that they sick till I prove that they not, Dr. Huxtable
Stacking more cheese than a forty pair of lunchables
And even white kids is telling me "Can't nobody fuck with you"
Open the front door, with a can of Coke, and I'm sippin' it slow
K.i.D can spit, real shit, let these niggas know
Me and Mr. Man, these niggas is manikins
Can't move when I enter the room frozen in a stance, damn
Hand a nigga his ass with, eight bars of that real shit
Trill nigga, don't feel shit
I ain't into that pill shit
Shout out to my niggas gettin' it in on that Skyrim
5'10", light-skinned, grippin' on that light-nin
Spittin' that flame my nigga, come firefight me
And if you hate losin' then you really not gone like me
And if you give me sixteen bars wreckin' it
I been around the globe homie but seconds' where I've never been
Talk 'bout making hits though
I could make a list yo
My flows slick as Crisco
Nigga's so cool, I piss cold
That weak shit you bring me
I K-I-D delete
Enough punch-lines to fight a nigga for three weeks
Yeah doggy doggy, yea doggy, niggas is off the leash
Campos will have your momma askin' "Where the fuck your teeth?"
K.i.D be workin', people askin' "When the fuck you sleep?"
"Sleep nigga?" I ain't had a bed since I was seventeen
Killin' beats and drinkin' Red Bull until it's hard to see
Yeah I'm on a diet, Mickey D's seven days a week
Weak niggas think they in my league, send em' back down to D
So ahead of my time nigga I feel like I'm 83

[Verse 2]
I'm ready for action, Jackson, Niggas know I'm attackin'
Smashin' niggas like an Asian taxi driver leave em crashin'
Casually I'm causin' casualties, Iâ€™ll leave these niggas gassed
I'm spittin that lighter fluid niggas don't know how to match it
Like a rug burn from Aladdin shit is tragic, nigga fuck around
Catch a whole overweight case said a nigga bow
Bang bang biggidy bang dang ow nigga ow
You can get caught in traffic, I hit the gas and lay niggas down
Yesum, and I hope God bless em
You can take your feedback and shove it up your rectum
And you take my insults right into the heart
Like all you niggas stink like damn nigga d'you fart?
(Damn nigga you fart, damn nigga you fart)
I guarantee you hear me and say damn nigga you hard
People want features be like damn nigga you charge
Cause on my SAT I scored damn nigga you smart
