Verse 1

Woah, Kyle's got flows/
Down south loves when I spit slow/
On the other hand, chillin wit my man/
Muslims love it when I spit fast, You know dat/
Kyle got them hot raps, them other rappers all wack/
They cold like ice packs, facts is what they lag/
Their connections, to weak, as 14/
Im quite nice, cleverness so mean/
My rap skills are ill, dont grill/
Made something, out, of nil/
Kill All, Who Kill, yeah still/
Your Mama, should of took, blue pill/
Your Highness, smokes eemces not trees/
Im eco-friendly, go green/
Stack cheese, watch enemies get cheesed/
Sincerely, H-E, the Rap Gen-iUs/

Chorus
