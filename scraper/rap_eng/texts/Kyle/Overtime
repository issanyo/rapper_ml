[Intro: Sebastian Reynoso]
Ooh, woah

[Chorus: Sebastian Reynoso]
Overtime, overtime
Is she really yours, or is she mine?
Is she driving yours, or is it mine?
Money on my mind, Richard Mille for the time
I was already in it, your shit lookin' rented
And I hope she know-ow-ows, I'm the man of the city
And she got the right to know-ow-ow, she might make an appearance
A weekend in Paris
Smoke weed 'til my face numb
I'm on, on, on, on, rackin' up the blue chips
On, on, on, on, always focused on a new bitch
On, on on, on, better off with yo bitch
Overtime, overtime
Is she really yours, or is she mine?
Is she driving yours, or is it mine?
Money on my mind, Richard Mille for the time

[Bridge: KYLE]
Can I hit it like itâ€™s all mine? Yeah
Do you need a little more time? Mmm
Pick you up in a new ride, yeah
I could hook you up with a new life
Haha, yeah

[Verse: KYLE]
Things he can't do, ayy
I make dreams come true, ayy
I could get you in the mood, ayy
Ooo Ooo, ayy
You know what to do, ayy
Baby make this move, ayy
Is she yours or mine? I wish I knew, ayy

[Chorus: Sebastian Reynoso with KYLE]
Overtime, overtime
Is she really yours, or is she mine?
Is she driving yours, or is it mine?
Money on my mind, Richard Mille for the time
I was already in it, your shit lookin' rented
And I hope she know-ow-ows, I'm the man of the city
And she has the right to know-ow-ow, she might make an appearance
A weekend in Paris
Smoke weed 'til my face numb

[Chorus: Sebastian Reynoso]
Overtime, overtime
Is she really yours, or is she mine?
Is she driving yours, or is it mine?

And I hope she know-ow-ows, I'm the man of the city
And she got the right to Know-ow-ow, she might make an appearance

Smoke weed 'til my face numb
