[Verse 1: Kyle]
Look well hey girl I'm Kyle I'm glad that you asked
I know that you know that we know you bad
I mean duh, hit you up been waiting for months
But your light skinned ass never texted me back
But yea it's good tho, no really it's good it's fine
There's really no point of me trying, you do this shit every time
Why don't you make me your main course instead of a fuckin' side
I'm a steak bitch, I'm not some fuckin' fries

[Pre-Hook: Buddy]
Ain't no doubt about it, I'm loving your body baby
And you know that you got it, so it doesn't matter what they say
Ain't no doubt about it, man I gotta make her my lady
Cuz when I see you drop it, baby was ridin' Mercedes

[Hook: Kyle & Buddy](x2)
Later on (I'm calling out yo name)
Baby doll (and I'm pouring out my pain)
All alone (now why would I complain)
When I have an angel

[Verse 2: Kyle]
Okay c'mon, really what's wrong
You're like the underlying topic of like 10 of my songs
And that's damn near an album
You should be at least a little happy that the happy rapper cares enough to write these songs about you
Seriously, I just don't do this shit for anyone
You can be with any dude, but those niggas ain't any fun
So what's the point of that, stop being an asshole
I wrote this song about you but I can take it back tho

[Bridge: Buddy]
I know Your halo kinda heavy baby
C'mon let me know when your ready baby
I know Your halo kinda heavy baby
C'mon let me know when your ready baby
