Every night I lie awake
My thoughts come rollin' in
Love is won, love is lost
And love's that might have been

I see the ghost of long lost hope
And shattered broken dreams
I know it's time to carry on
It's harder than it seemed

I've gotta let it go
All the pain is ripe
I've gotta let it go
And move on with my life

I've gotta let it go
It's time to let it leave
I've gotta let it go
And then I can be free

The times gone by, I can't deny
They left a mark on me
Don't understand the master plan
That only God can see

I need to know, I won't let go
And lock it all inside
I wonder why they say goodbye
And gather up my pride

I've gotta let it go
All the pain is ripe
I've gotta let it go
And move on with my life

I've gotta let it go
It's time to let it leave
I've gotta let it go
And then I can be free

I know I have the will to carry on
Life's made me strong
I've learned too much to turn my head away
I'm gonna stand

Brick by brick, I'll build my life again
And I'll begin to learn from all of my mistakes
And make them fly away
I've gotta let it go

I've gotta let it go
I've gotta let it go
I've gotta let it go

I've gotta let it go
I've gotta let it go
I've gotta let it go

I've gotta let it go
All the pain is ripe
I've gotta let it go
And move on with my life

I've gotta let it go
It's time to let it leave
I've gotta let it go
