And all the girls like...

Chorus
Nigga who's that nigga/
Switching flows on these hoes while he focused on that paper, right/
Yeah, that boy got skill/
The baddest women drop it low cause they feel a nigga real/
Yeah, he rock jays on the cap/
All black er'thing, show the city where I'm at/
Shit, I'm just nice like that/
Now who would ever know that he could rap/

Verse 1
I slipped into the party with my bro/
Guys nodded at the door, we meandered to the floor/
Party moving kinda slow, so I went and took a seat/
Chillin, my C7 bobbin to the beat/
Bad chic flicked her hair, put her rear on a frere/
I said my dear Christmas ain't even near/
She said her name was Dee, and she said she from the D/
So we reached 503, couple cups and double D's/

Chorus
Nigga who's that nigga/
Switching flows on these hoes while he focused on that paper, right/
Yeah, that boy got skill/
The baddest women drop it low cause they feel a nigga real/
Yeah, he rock jays on the cap/
All black er'thing, show the city where I'm at/
Shit, I'm just nice like that/
Now who would ever thought that he could rap/

Verse 2
My hermanos and I in the back of the V.I./
Pete got the drinks and them girls start to realize/
Our stilo, wait whose this dude in the nero/
I recognized foe cause he grillin at our notes/
Sonny acting bright, said he's looking for his bro/
Typically its no questions, untuck from the coat/
Shot to the dome but I felt for his mom/
So we sent body shots cause we nice like France/

Chorus
