[Intro]
Whoo!
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You graduated college, and you still don't do shit (Still don't do shit)
You try and move to L.A., with a nigga that you cool with (With a nigga that you cool with)
You say you done bein' single, time to get you a man though (Try and get you a man though)
So you front and date a rapper, that's a real good plan though (Sike)

[Refrain]
You just wanna go to where the beach is
Wanna ball and now somebody in the bleachers
Want a nigga gettin' money for a feature
My name's Kyle, baby you should do your research
I'm the nigga on that little kid t-shirt
Girl, I'm loyal and I'm funny, I'm a keeper
These niggas like me, just cheaper, just cheaper, d-word, key word (Yeah yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
She got 15K saved up in a bank account
Told her, "Sorry babe, but that's not enough to make it out
Don't trip cuz it's okay, I got enough for the both of us
I got enough for the both of us
Yeah, girl you know what's up"

[Chorus]
I can take you to Rodeo, oh-oh, oh
We can do it e'ryday-o, oh-oh oh
You know you don't have to pay though (Pay though)
But you want some new things though (Yeah yeah)
Young girl from the A, just tryna make it in L.A., yeah (Oh oh)

[Verse 2]
You got your mom new number, but you still don't use it (You still don't use it)
You got a few new boyfriends, and they all make music (And they all make music)
You don't even fuck with they single, but it beats bein' single (But it beats bein' single)
You just needed someone to cling to, so you don't feel see through (Mmm)

[Refrain]
So you moved out to the ocean
Unfollowed all the people you was close with
You was out here tryna be the dopest
Now you just tryna find where the dope is
You really just want a nigga to smoke with
You tryna live life on a high note (High note)
You're feeling pretty low as far as I know, as far as I know
But what do I know? Mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
She had 15K saved up in a bank account
Threw that all away, now she's stuck leasin' someone's couch
Told her, "It's okay, I got a crib for the both of us
I got a crib for the both of us
Yeah, you already know what's up"

[Chorus]
I can take you to Rodeo, oh-oh, oh
We can do it e'ryday-o, oh-oh, oh
You just want a nigga to save you (Save you)
Don't wanna let this town change you (Yeah yeah)
Young girl from the A, just tryna make it in L.A., yeah
