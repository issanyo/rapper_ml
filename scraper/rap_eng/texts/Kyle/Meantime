[Intro: Jesse Rutherford]
New York fashion week
Dressed well
Front row with my lady
Stretched out
I spend too much money
Flex, ouch
I spent too much money
Stressed out

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
Hope that it's okay if we chill at home today
I could sit right here forever, count the freckles on your face
Baby, I don't mind paying for dinner tonight
Call an Uber up in five, kiss me in the meantime

[Post-Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
Kiss me in the meantime
Let's stay home, let's stay home

[Verse 2: Kyle]
You could be my sailor moon
I need saving, girl not you
I see babies coming soon
One of 'em, another one
A ton of 'em, mmm
You're like my partner in crime, crime, crime
Got me when I'm in a bind, I might
Buy you a trip to Japan, goddamn
Let everyone know it's mine, mine, mine
You just get better with time
That ass is aging like wine
These bitches aging like bread
I don't gotta leave the crib
I got Magic Mountain right in my bed

[Pre-Chorus: Kyle]
You're my favourite ride
It don't got no lines, nah
We can go to Tokyo, it's fine
Or I can hit it just as good inside

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
Hope that it's okay if we chill at home today
I could sit right here forever, count the freckles on your face
Baby, I don't mind paying for dinner tonight
Call an Uber up in five, kiss me in the meantime

[Outro: Jesse Rutherford]
Kiss me in the meantime
Kiss me in the meantime
Let's stay home
Kiss me in the meantime
Let's stay home
Kiss me in the meantime
