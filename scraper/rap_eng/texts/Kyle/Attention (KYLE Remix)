[Intro: KYLE]
Mh, who knew it
I'd have to see you as a threat
Now I just wanna see you less
MTV, I'll be on the Next, uh
Yeah, I ain't try to place no blame, ooh
Everything my mom said came, true (my mom said came)
She said we'd be better off friends
Now that would make no sense, mhmm

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Call you up
You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round
Every party in LA
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Be at one, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, oh

[Verse 2: Charlie Puth]
You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Call you up
Baby, now that we're, now that we're, now that we're
Right here standin' face to face
You already know, 'ready know, 'ready know
That you won, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect? (oh baby)
But you're not coming home with me tonight, oh no

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new (someone new)
Yeah, you just want attention (oh), I knew from the start (the start)
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you (over you), oh

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? (What are you doin'?)
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? (What are you doin'?)
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? (What are you doin'?)
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh?

[Verse 3: KYLE]
(Psh)
Yeah, well I guess, uh
You ain't been functionin' at your best, uh (yep)
Searchin' for attention in my mentions (yep)
Like talkin' shit's the only way to get some, nope (hahaha)
But you can try
Trust me, baby, you ain't gon' be gettin' none of mine
Other niggas maybe but I'm a different design
Lotta suckas are so I know you're doin' fine, yeah (know you're doin' fine, yeah)

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, oh (over you)

[Outro: Charlie Puth]
What are you doin' to me? (Hey)
What are you doin', huh? (What are you doin', love?)
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? (Yeah, you just want attention)
What are you doin' to me? (I knew from the start)
What are you doin' huh? (You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you)
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh?
