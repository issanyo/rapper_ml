[Music Video Intro: Kyle & Jada Boo]
Hey
Hey, so you're going to that party later tonight?
Yeah, I'm-I'm gettin' ready to go link up with everybody
Well, I was really hoping that you could stay the night with me
Yeah, I know, I wish I could too but I... I gotta go to this tonight, it's...
You always gotta go to something
I know, I know, okay? Look, I... I gotta go now
Whatever
Alright, bye

[Intro: Kyle & Jesse Rutherford]
Oooooo
Lotta something
Swerve off like before
Run down like before
Swerve
Run like, run like

[Hook: Kyle]
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of nothing
Thinkin' 'bout a whole lot at the same time
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of lovin'
Trying not to love bitches that ain't mine
Ain't been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of thugging
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of hugging
Me and you can be a whole lot of somethin'
Me and you can be a whole lot of somethin'
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of nothing
Thinkin' 'bout a whole lot at the same time
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of lovin'
Trying not to love bitches that ain't mine
Ain't been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of thugging
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of hugging
Me and you can be a whole lot of somethin'
Me and you can be a whole lot of somethin'

[Verse 1: Kyle]
Uh, finding baes on @FoundBAE
I swear I spend way to much time on that damn page
Tell me why, tell me why you don't like me as much as my pictures, girl
Now that isn't the same, now that don't feel the same
Too much body for the phone, tryna to fit it all in frame
Let's have a hundred thousand kids
And try to give 'em all a name
And we can take 'em all to school
In a hundred limousines
And make a hundred thousand more and we can do it all again

[Hook: Kyle & Jesse Rutherford]
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of nothing
Thinkin' 'bout a whole lot at the same time
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of lovin'
Trying not to love bitches that ain't mine
Ain't been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of thugging
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of hugging
Me and you can be a whole lot of somethin'
Me and you can be a whole lot of somethin'
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of nothing (I've been thinkin')
Thinkin' 'bout a whole lot at the same time
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of lovin' (I've been thinkin')
Trying not to love bitches that ain't mine
Ain't been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of thugging (I've been thinkin')
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of hugging
Me and you can be a whole lot of somethin'
Me and you can be a whole lot of somethin'

[Verse 2: Jesse Rutherford]
I knew, I knew, I knew that we would be hard to be
Did you, did you, did you, did you know it's hard for me, yeah?
I know you miss me too but whenever you're not with me
Honestly I'm missing part of me (part of me)
Hey! It's the same thing, (cool) you knew me since back in the day, hey (cool)
You made me ride around when the flame came
Had to play the game, now I know that the game's lame
So tonight I just wanna go and like every one of your pictures
I got a hundred thousand girls, treat 'em all like my sisters

[Hook: Kyle & Jesse Rutherford]
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of nothing
Thinkin' 'bout a whole lot at the same time
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of lovin'
Trying not to love bitches that ain't mine
Ain't been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of thugging
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of hugging
Me and you can be a whole lot of somethin'
Me and you can be a whole lot of somethin'
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of nothing (I've been thinkin')
Thinkin' 'bout a whole lot at the same time
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of lovin' (I've been thinkin')
Trying not to love bitches that ain't mine
Ain't been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of thugging (I've been thinkin')
I've been thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of hugging
Me and you can be a whole lot of somethin'
Me and you can be a whole lot of somethin'

[Music Video Outro: Kyle & Jada Boo]
Hey, you know, I got mad last night and... I didn't mean for it to get that out of hand
It's just... well, you know... I want you here
I miss you and I just want you to come back home
Please just call me back
I love you
You look through the deepest part of me
You look through the deepest part of me
(Do you want to start the game again?)
You look through the deepest part of me
