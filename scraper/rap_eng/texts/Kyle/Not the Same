[Chorus]
Not the same, we are not the same
Not the same, we are not the same
Don't know your name, I don't know your name
We're not the same, we are not the-
Not the same, we are not the same
We're not the same, we are not the same
Not the same, we are not the same
We're not the same, we are not the same

[Verse 1]
They creepin' right, creepin' left and right
They need the light, them boys used to lyin'
We're not alike once you look inside
I'm getting mine, they just getting by
Facts, I am not the rest of the pack
I am not a random nigga stutterin' a rap
I know how to do something nobody can
Take a throwaway track, turn it to a plaque, whoa
Magic, it's magic
Law of attraction, I guess I'm attractive
Take the baddest and vanish
If I can think it, I can have it all

[Chorus]
Not the same, we are not the same
Not the same, we are not the same
Don't know your name, I don't know your name
We're not the same, we are not the-
Not the same, we are not the same
We're not the same, we are not the same
Not the same, we are not the same
We're not the same, we are not the same

[Verse 2]
What they call you, that's a different name
We're not the same, we are not the same
A different lane, it's a different lane
We're not the same, we are not the same
Ooh, I've been floating for an hour
Ooh, diamonds wet, they took a shower
Oooh, she said I don't have to buy flowers
Wow, I guess I got superpowers
I got this game on easy, my blessings stay on repeat
Got money in my emails and all my homies CC'ed
Yet, don't hesitate, every time I check for the check
It ain't never late, million dollar mindset
Boy, you gotta meditate, I'ma level up til I levitate, levitate

[Chorus]
Not the same, we are not the same
Not the same, we are not the same
Don't know your name, I don't know your name
We're not the same, we are not the
Not the same, we are not the same
Not the same, we are not the same
Don't know your name, I don't know your name
We're not the same, we are not the-
