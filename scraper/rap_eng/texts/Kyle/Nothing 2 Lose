[Chorus]
Boy, I'm doing good, how 'bout you? (how 'bout you)
All the homies doing good too (doing good too)
If a nigga trippin' we ain't really trippin' (ain't really trippin')
We got nothing to lose, got nothing to lose
Boy, I'm doing good, how 'bout you? (how 'bout you)
All the homies doing good too (doing good too)
If a nigga trippin' we ain't really trippin' (ain't really trippin')
We got nothing to lose, got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose, got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose, got nothing to lose
If a nigga trippin' we ain't really trippin'
We got nothing to lose, got nothing to lose

[Verse 1]
I bought a crib, I'll paint it pink and blue a nerdy nigga into Pikachu
But who got hands? I'm down to catch 'em all
I got nothing to lose, got nothing to lose (facts)
I don't care what you say, you niggas corny, right
Missionary, all these niggas boring, right
I played your mixtape and fell asleep, facts
I don't know what you on, but it ain't repeat
No, that shit is one-done-da-da
Have you thought about going to college? Well, you oughta
Comma, I cosign myself so you don't gotta
Cause' I only need approval from my niggas and my momma
Got 'em

[Chorus]
Boy, I'm doing good, how 'bout you? (how 'bout you)
All the homies doing good too (good too)
If a nigga trippin' we ain't really trippin' (ain't really trippin')
We got nothing to lose, got nothing to lose
Boy, I'm doing good, how 'bout you? (how 'bout you)
All the homies doing good too (doing good too)
If a nigga trippin' we ain't really trippin' (ain't really trippin')
We got nothing to lose, got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose, got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose, got nothing to lose
If a nigga trippin' we ain't really trippin'
We got nothing to lose, got nothing to lose

[Verse 2]
Ooh, ooh I think another platinum plaque is coming soon
Who knew I would make it out these twenty dollar shoes
I just got too popping for my spot, I gotta move
Cause people plotting on me, yeah I got em too
But got nothing to prove, remember I was doing bad
Life hit me hella hard, I got up and hit that nigga back
I know they wanna see me come in last
Tell 'em see you later gotta blast
They was sleeping on me hella bad
Now I got them all up from their nap
Yeah, and this ain't one-done-da-da
This year was a movie, and next year gon' be the saga
Comma
If you don't fuck with me, it's not a problem
Cause' I only need approval from my niggas and my momma
Got 'em

[Chorus]
Boy, I'm doing good, how 'bout you? (how 'bout you)
All the homies doing good too (good too)
If a nigga trippin' we ain't really trippin' (ain't really trippin')
We got nothing to lose, got nothing to lose
Boy, I'm doing good, how 'bout you? (how 'bout you)
All the homies doing good too (doing good too)
If a nigga trippin' we ain't really trippin' (ain't really trippin')
We got nothing to lose, got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose, got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose, got nothing to lose
If a nigga trippin' we ain't really trippin'
We got nothing to lose, got nothing to lose

[Outro]
Aye
Turn it up
