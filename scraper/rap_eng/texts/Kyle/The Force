[Verse 1]
I got the  muhfucking force
My nigga you ain't got a choice
You ain't got a muhfucking choice
You either fuck with King Wavy or get torched
Don't speak the truth, then I don't hear your voice
Please keep talking, I'm the light skin Skywalker
Try to name a better nigga walking
Nervous when I walk in, they know it's my time
One line, do em like vine, put 'em in a coffin
We don't see shit like this often, once you get on it I'm off it
We don't know anything other than awesome
We would want anything other than problems
But we don't know anything other than toss them
But it's still love and peace (love and peace)
Wishing hella hugs on my enemies (enemies)
Flow so sick, oh shit, touch Nol Smith
I'mma blow they asses to smithereens

[Hook]
Pew pew, pew pew, pew pew
Why they wanna shoot my star ship down?
I'mma fly, I won't let em know
Try to bring me towards the dark side
I-I-I got the force
I got the force
I can make the world do whatever I want, I got the force
I got the force
I got the force
I'mma make the world do whatever I want I got the force

(I got the force, I got the force, I got the force)
(I got the force, I got the force)

[Verse 2]
So shut the fuck up and listen, dawg
You niggas must have been trippin, dawg
Who in the fuck is you kidding?
Thinking that I don't go 100 percentage a 100 percent of the time that I'm in it, dawg
Wondering why you not getting far, that's cause you don't really get it, dawg
Your shit just don't have a message, and based on your visuals I see you don't see the vision, dawg
They order me to your city and pay me the money and all the attention, dawg
And they gon cover the travel for me and my niggas and my niggas' niggas to cover the shipping, dawg
Yeah, I sense the envy for the dark side plots against me
Young based Windu doing what they pretend to
For now till the end dude the force is with me

[Hook]
Pew pew, pew pew, pew pew
Why they wanna shoot my star ship down?
I'mma fly, I won't let em know
Try to bring me towards the dark side
I-I-I got the force
I got the force
I can make the world do whatever I want, I got the force
I got the force
I got the force
I'mma make the world do whatever I want I got the force

(I got the force, I got the force, I got the force)
(I got the force, I got the force)

I got the force, I got the force, I got the force, I got the force
I got the force, I got the force, I got the force, I got the force, I got the force
