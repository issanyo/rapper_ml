[Into]
Oh my god
Why is my head pounding?
Where the fuck am I?
Is that a fucking goat?
Yeah, yeah
Uh, hey, uh, naked, yeah, strippers, yeah

[Verse]
So um, what the fuck happened?
I woke up this morning with a mouth full of captain
Room full of Magnums
Damn I need an Asprin
Who is this chick, and why is she unattractive?
Really gotta pee, but I'm tied to the mattress
Girl and Solo Cup, I hope that I'm accurate
Hope that I make it, oh fuck I missed
And that poor girl is literally pissed on
To the next, open up my phone have 2 million texts
'Bout the shit I did, I wanted to forget
The fucked up times I'm never gonna regret
The hotels, Vegas, the strippers, naked
Who's buff, Jake is, I feel, famous
Super duper crazy forgetting I'm entertaining
I did more covers than blankets
Now I'm here calling my agents
Said I'd never make it like my taxi driver's Asian
Now I take vacations to the fucking space station
They feel life's a bitch, well tonight she looks amazing
Feel like she's up for the taking, right

[Chorus]
I had too much last night
We had the time of our life
No sleep, but we feel fine
It's alright, 'cuz we had the time
The time of our life
The time of our life
The time of our life
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
So now I'm broke, so what
See I'm drunk, oh fuck
And let's rage, and go nuts
Let's get, turned up
Yeah, so I'm gone
Met some girl who looks like [?]
But in reality she looks like my dog
But bottles make girls look like models, it's awesome
Yeah it's really fucking cool
Makes you do a lot of things you wouldn't fucking do
Like ask that one girl, to bring that one girl
Back to the crib let me undress you
But only get to see though
Yeah, she knows
But she ain't gonna stop
From getting shit poppin'
Until I hit the motherfuckin' flow

[Chorus]
I had too much last night
We had the time of our life
No sleep, but we feel fine
It's alright, 'cuz we had the time
The time of our life
The time of our life
The time of our life
Yeah, yeah
