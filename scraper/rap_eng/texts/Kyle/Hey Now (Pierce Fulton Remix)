[Instrumental: Pierce Fulton]

[Verse 1: Martin Solveig]
I'm all alone now, check it out
Me and you should take a vacay
I got a plan now, we're going out
Save you whining for another day
Here's the thing I wanna talk about
Listen all, you gotta hear me out
We get it done, we get it done my own way
I just wanna say (Wait!)

[Chorus: Martin Solveig]
Hey now, hey now
I haven't had a good laugh for a day now
Hey now, hey now
You know you're down, let's do this right now
Hey now, hey now
Up top, we're the kings of the playground
Hey now, hey now
You know you're down, let's do this right now

Wait! Yeah
Let's do this right now
Wait!

[Post-Chorus: Martin Solveig]
Hey now, hey now
Up top, we're the kings of the playground
Hey now, hey now
You know you're down, let's do this right now

Wait!

[Chorus: Martin Solveig & KYLE]
Hey now, hey now
I haven't had a good laugh for a day now (Haha, na-ah)
Hey now, hey now
You know you're down, let's do this right now
Hey now, hey now
Up top, we're the kings of the playground
Hey now, hey now
You know you're down, let's do this right now

[Outro: Martin Solveig]
Wait!
Wait!
