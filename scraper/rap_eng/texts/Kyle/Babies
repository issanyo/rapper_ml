[Verse 1: KYLE & Alessia Cara]
Yeah I am pretty insecure
Yeah I know I'm immature (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
And you change your mood like clothes (Mmm)
First you, on off, caught up, on off, come come, come come, go
And I was learnin' ABC's, no one taught me how to love you
I mess up, you get things wrong, we're supposed to
We have no clue

[Chorus: KYLE & Alessia Cara]
And maybe, we're still babies
We don't have to know
We don't have to know
And maybe, we're still babies
We got time to grow
We got time to grow, mm

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
And I wear my feelings on my sleeve (Oh no, no no no)
And I consume your energy (Yeah yeah)
But you speak a language I don't know, no no no (No no no)
First you, yes no, guess so, for sure, stop go
Just slow down (Just slow down)
And this ain't easy 1-2-3's, no one taught me how to love you (No one taught me)
We're far from school, don't know the rules, we don't have to (We don't have to)
We have no clue

[Chorus: Alessia Cara & KYLE]
And maybe, we're still babies
We don't have to know
We don't have to know
And maybe, we're still babies
We don't have to know
We don't have to know
And maybe, we're still babies
We got time to grow
We got time to grow mm

[Outro: KYLE & Alessia Cara]
Woah, babies
Woah, babies
Woah, babies
Woah, babies
(Babies, babies, babies, babies)
