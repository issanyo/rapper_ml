[Chorus: Miguel & KYLE]
Sunshine (so good)
If you threw it in the air, babe
I couldn't help but stare, babe
I'd let you love me blind, sunshine
I'm gonna bathe in your light, babe
All day, all night, babe, make me wanna say
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, (so good) la-la-la-la-la-la-la, (oh my God) la-la-la-la-la-la-la (oh my God)
La-la, make me want to say (ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, (so good) la-la-la-la-la-la-la, (oh my God) la-la-la-la-la-la-la (oh my God)

[Verse 1: KYLE]
Ay, yep, hey, let's take a trip
Down to the beach where the pretty girls live
Away from your condo, way up in the cold
Girl, you too fine to be gettin' snowed in
You know that shit, heh
You spend your days inside
That ain't how you're designed
Was tan but now you're white (ugh)
Think you could use some shine

[Pre-Chorus: KYLE]
On the best coast, on the best coast, sad days
We don't get those, we don't get those
Do you wanna come zone in the sunshine?
Baby, let's go, baby, let's go

[Chorus: Miguel & KYLE]
Sunshine (so good)
If you threw it in the air, babe
I couldn't help but stare, babe
I'd let you love me blind, sunshine (hah, yeah)
I'm gonna bathe in your light, babe
All day, all night, babe, make me wanna say
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, (so good) la-la-la-la-la-la-la, (oh my God) la-la-la-la-la-la-la (oh my God)
La-la, make me want to say (ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, (so good) la-la-la-la-la-la-la, (oh my God) la-la-la-la-la-la-la (oh my God)

[Verse 2: KYLE]
Yeah, yeah
Baby, you summertime fine
Come on down to Cali', see what summertime's like
You need to be relieved, you live in 50 degrees
Girl, we gettin' high, a high of 79, right?
Whatever, all dubs, yup, women, weed, weather
If your home girl hate and bake, go ahead and let her
You out on vacation, your location doing better, yeah (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: KYLE]
On the best coast, on the best coast, sad days
We don't get those, we don't get those
Do you wanna come zone in the sunshine?
Baby, let's go, baby, let's go

[Bridge: Miguel]
Shine on me, on me now, be alright, (yeah) babe (yeah, yeah)
I need you to shine on me, on me
All day and night (oh)
Babe, you make me want to say

[Chorus: Miguel & KYLE]
Sunshine (oh no, yeah) (so good)
Threw it in the air, babe
I couldn't help but stare, babe
I'd let you love me blind, (ah) sunshine (yeah)
I'm gonna bathe in your light, babe
All day, all night, babe, make me wanna say
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, (so good) la-la-la-la-la-la-la, (oh my God) la-la-la-la-la-la-la (oh my God)
La-la, make me want to say (ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, (so good) la-la-la-la-la-la-la, (oh my God) la-la-la-la-la-la-la (oh my God)
Babe, make me want to say
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, (so good) la-la-la-la-la-la-la, (oh my God) la-la-la-la-la-la-la (oh my God)
La-la, make me want to say (ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, (so good) la-la-la-la-la-la-la, (oh my God) la-la-la-la-la-la-la (oh my) (hey, yeah, babe)
