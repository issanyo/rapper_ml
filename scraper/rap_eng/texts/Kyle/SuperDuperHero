[Intro]
Yeah, um, okay, so look, look
Apparently my only super power is blowing shit up
Blowing up phones, blowing up cells and blowing up homes
But your head's the only thing that I be blowing up more
You the light skin lantern, attitude is crazy
One text wonder, Captain curve lady
Damsel in distress in a distressed dress
SuperDuperKyle's good as it gets

[Hook: Kyle]
Baby come on by, I'll teach you how to fly
I can be your super hero
Baby come on by, I'll teach you how to fly
I can be your super hero

[Verse 1: Kyle]
Yeah, when I was 13 I thought I could fly, right?
Must've been high, right? I'm out of my mind, right?
Shady ass niggas never give you shine, right?
You kicked it with me and never be on the side, right?
Cause you're more than a side kick to me girl, yeah
You'll  never be a side chick to me girl, yeah
SuperDuperKyle give you what you need girl, yeah
Aquarium the size of like Sea World, yeah
See Aquaman is super overrated, so is Superman
Batman slid in your DMs, he can get the hands
Heard you kissed a girl and you liked it
Guess Wonder Woman's on some dyke shit
I heard she's tryna try shit
I'm only as down as you are
Fly you to the moon, baby, I know where a few are
Really? Send Uber spaceship to swoop through and get you
SuperDuperKyle to the rescue

[Hook]
Baby come on by, I can teach you how to fly (Yes I will)
I can be your super hero, super hero, super hero
Baby come on by, I can teach you how to fly (Yes I will)
I can be your super hero, super hero, super hero
Baby come on by, I can teach you how to fly (Yes I will)
I can be your super hero, super hero, super hero
Baby come on by, I can teach you how to fly (Yes I will)
I can be your super hero, super hero, super hero

[Bridge]
Go up up and away-ay
Up up and away-ay
Up up and away-ay
Up up and away-ay
Up up and away-ay
Up up and away-ay
Up up and away-ay
Up up and away-ay

[Verse 2: SuperDuperBrick]
I can take you up up up up and away
As long as you're on leave, I want you stay
And your absence is just like my kryptonite
Yo hips got Super Brick so hypnotized
No shit, oh shit, water woman let me swim all in your ocean
I'll do it all once I'm done smoking
And I don't wanna play games cause baby I ain't got enough tokens
I'll just pull up with a smile and some lotion
And maybe I can lay the pipe like I'm Iron Man
I'll bring that sticky icky icky icky like I'm Spider-Man
Oh damn, that's a double entendre
Your best superpower is acting like you don't want me, hello
These niggas irrelevant and you see I been killing it
I'll send an Uber elephant to get you for the hell of it
Don't wanna spend your life at a desk, you
Want SuperDuperBrick to the rescue

[Hook]
Baby come on by, I can teach you how to fly (Yes I will)
I can be your super hero, super hero, super hero
Baby come on by, I can teach you how to fly (Yes I will)
I can be your super hero, super hero, super hero
Superman that hoe, youuuuuuu

[Outro]
Go up up and away-ay
Up up and away-ay
Up up and away-ay
Up up and away-ay
Up up and away-ay
Up up and away-ay
Up up and away-ay
Up up and away-ay
