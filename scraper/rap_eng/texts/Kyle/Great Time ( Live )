Verse 1
Its K-y-l-e, yall ready know me/
Not bruce like lee, more like Almighty/
The rap eemce, who brings the heat/
Scorching beats, to the 3rd degree/
See, my deep lines its heart felt/
Non higher, Spitting fire, make mics melt/
Get your oven mitts, Im just too hot/
You can't match witts, your boy so not/
Better than me, and my whole team/
We got cream, so we're supreme/
Pathfinder swervin, clear blue skies/
Reach popeyes, 8 peice large fries/
Chill for a bit talk biz in the van/
One week after talk biz the man/
28 days later, we infect the world/
Over your head like birds, you dont understand/
Gorgeous, thats how I flow/
Your lines like snow, mine pryo/
Yes I know, Kyle's on the rise/
Cause he got flow, 93.5/
Oh my, Kyle so fly/
He's nocturnal, yeah no lie/
Dont play with him, he's not a toy/
He's just too advanced no game boy/

Chorus
You having a good time make some noise right now/
If you having a great time make some noise right now/
You having a good time make some noise right now/
If you having a great time make some noise right now/

Verse 2
They say it gotta be you, one direction/
The reason why rhymers started stressin/
Stop the crying let this be a lesson/
Im oh powerful like Will and Wesson/
Who knows, who spits facts, and who run raps/
Never pull hamstrangs, I ball without caps/
With hard metaphors, conisseurs adore/
Rocking with the boy, I know the crowd love that/
Rhymes I kick like gitoni/
Shout to all my homies, Got more friends than joey/
Thats why I never ever mess with you phony's/
Who just want more fame than Kony/
Only, Kyle would be here an actually spit/
Cause this chic told me that Im actually sick/

Chorus
You having a good time make some noise right now/
If you had a great time make some noise right now/
All my homies in the building make some noise right now/
If you had a great time make some noise right now/
