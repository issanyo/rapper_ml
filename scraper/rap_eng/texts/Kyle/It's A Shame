[Hook: The Kid]

More power to ya if your voice for the voices
Mind changing thoughts but their mouths stay voiceless
Fingers get pointed if a nigga have a thought
How we have a brain and heart
But our words get voided?
Feel I've been appointed
Leading by example
Know these niggas bright but they blowing out the candle
It's a fast life so you gotta get a handle
Never ever gonna shine if you're standing in a shadow

[Verse 1: The Kid]

Too many niggas have dreams but never chase them
That category ain't for me
I ain't afraid of
The struggle with the hustle
The rubble is where I came from
My plan to show these little niggas what I'm made of
I know myself, I know I'm destined for greatness
Gotta wonder why The Kid making bold statements
This is for the ones hating
Still got me in they playlist
But it's my fate, Can't wait to say
Bitch I made it
I'm just playing
This is for niggas with goals and dreams
Do ya thing and please follow my soles
Follow ya soul
Gotta keep moving on
At times I slip but gotta keep holding on
And still follow the road
I question what I do it for
Is it myself?
To try and channel all this anger I've built
Ain't worried bout all the wealth
I do this shit for all the misguided kids
Who think that there's one way to live
And trip on the hand they was dealt
Yeah

[Hook: The Kid]

More power to ya if your voice for the voices
Mind changing thoughts but their mouths stay voiceless
Fingers get pointed if a nigga have a thought
How we have a brain and heart
But our words get voided?
Feel I've been appointed
Leading by example
Know these niggas bright but they blowing out the candle
It's a fast life so you gotta get a handle
Never ever gonna shine if you're standing in a shadow

[Verse 2: The Kid]

It's a thought that I'm living with everyday
Sometimes it get hard, but I'm gonna find a way
Sometimes I slip and I fall but I ain't ashamed
Sometimes my feeling set in but I ain't afraid
I made, my goals evident
I got the evidence
Nobody knows all the problems that I be dealing with
Should I sit at the crib, so I can raise my kid
Or should I put it on my girl so I can make a hit
And get it off the ground
I'm tryna make a sound
Cuz ain't nobody 'sides myself going to hold us down
They say they will but when it comes down to it
They never come around
I'll scream it loud, Fuck if I amount
At least I try
Take my life and I'll ride with it, I'll die with it
To never try is a full life sentence
I ain't a menace, I'm just saying what they don't wanna hear
I hope you hearing that I'm making it clear
Fuck the fear, Of the failure
Ain't a nigga realer
Ain't a pussy, Ain't a killer
Ain't afraid of the mirror
Looking straight at it
See a man with a dream
And a thing, for the chase
And a chance to reach at it

It's all love nigga
