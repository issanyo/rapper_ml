[Intro]

[Hook]
Well hey there Pickle doo, you're my little dude
There's a lot me that I see in you
You like to take my things and throw them everywhere
When mother isn't here, your always in my hair
You're always breaking stuff that make a lot of noise
And when you start to scream i get so annoyed

[Verse 1]
When you start screeching it can be a little scary
Sound sorta like a cat that's singing Mariah Carey
Well who that? Who that?
They already knew that
That's the homie pickle, I'm the one he throwing food at
Yup, you're really good at throwing fits
And when it comes to potatoes it seems like you never miss
I get a plate to the face and some milk up in my eyeball
I swear you know how to use your bottle like a rifle
I know I'm not your dad and I have no problem with trap
But I'm a little concerned that Chief Keef is your idol
Every time someone plays 'That's that shit I don't like,' you be like 'Bang Bang'
And I'm like alright
Um, It's really not the music for kids
But, um, here Pickle, let's listen to Jaden Smith

[Hook]
Well hey there Pickle doo, you're my little dude
There's a lot me that I see in you
You like to take my things and throw them everywhere
When mother isn't here, your always in my hair
You're always breaking stuff that make a lot of noise
And when you start to scream I get so annoyed

[Verse 2: Kyle]
Yup, you can make me mad for a while
But when I see your face it's impossible not to smile
Well hey, yo mom
I know you got your show on
But you got a kid that kicks more than the Zohan
Little guy is crazy
I try not to get him angry
Cause he foams at the mouth like he's diagnosed with rabies
When dealing with Pickle, it's all about survival
He isn't even a year and a half and he curses more than I do
He's all about this 'West West' shit like Fievel
He keeps it show G and he doesn't even try to
I remember when he took his first little steps
A week later he was running after cigarettes
I told him look chill
Like what the hell is the deal
Even though you're evil, little buddy, I love you still
Yeah

[Hook]
Well hey there Pickle doo, you're my little dude
There's a lot me that I see in you
You like to take my things and throw them everywhere
When mother isn't here, your always in my hair
Your always breaking stuff that make a lot of noise
And when you start to scream i get so annoyed
Yup, you can make me mad for a while
But when I see your face it's impossible not to smile
Yeah
