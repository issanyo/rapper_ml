[Intro]
Hey
Yo, hey

[Verse]
Young OH! is the one they know so well
Real recognize real, yo name ring no bells
I'm finna be on these rap niggas Coattails, oh well
Niggas going copper, they makin' no sales
I ain't having that
Music's going platinum or platinum
These niggas be thinking like Mike Jones
Somebody like me, be thinking like Mike Jackson
Yo, my homie Jeff has got me dressin' like a model
Going full throttle, eating Chip O'Lees, fuck that, Chipot-le
Having itches, sending naked yitty pictures for a follow
Outrageous, hit the stage
They lose their heads like Sleepy Hollow
Beast Coast where it's at
I mean, Y-O to be exact
I know only this much of me is black
But I know the streets so well, I don't need a map
I'm really real, I don't need to act
Nigga, I got a job, I don't need to trap
Young OH!'s dope, that's something I know
So the niggas at my show, don't need to clap

[Outro]
Yo, Wiz, this shit is strong, nigga
I'm fuckin' smacked
