[Chorus: KYLE]
This feel like my chance
This feel like my moment
Everyone needs a fan
Everyone needs a close up
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
No body's a no one

[Verse 1: KYLE]
Through it all, I'm gleaming
I'm the me I see when I be dreaming
I remember thinking that I'd never see it
I remember thinking that I'd never be it
Now I pay my mom's lease with an appearance fee
'Cause they screaming my name I must be hearing things
But nah, it's all, it's all for you
Your life, your dreams, they all come true

[Chorus: KYLE]
This feel like my chance
This feel like my moment
Everyone needs a fan
Everyone needs a close up
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
This feel like my chance
This feel like my moment
Everyone needs a fan
Everyone needs a close up
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
Nobody's a no one
Yeah, nobody's a no one

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I just wanna roll one
They gon' talk about you bad until they see you glow up
Want me in your building, need a half a mil to show up
I don't see the dealer, need a pound and I'ma grow one
Hop in the coupe and I'm swerving lanes
No new friends, I'm curvin' lames
My niggas solid, stay the same
I see the top, that's my favorite place
Going to work, got no time to waste
Takin' my time, I ain't trying to race
I'ma stay all on my grind
Stackin' my G's to the sky
Rollin' that weed with my guys

[Chorus: KYLE]
This feel like my chance
This feel like my moment
Everyone needs a fan
Everyone needs a close up
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
Nobody's a no one
Yeah, nobody's a no one
Ayy, yeah, yeah
Ayy, yeah, ayy

[Verse 3: KYLE]
Nobody's a no one
I don't sound like no one
Did this on my own, huh
I feel just like Goku or Gohan, I go hard
I threw up on Wiz, nigga
I still made it big nigga
You can't tell me shit nigga

[Chorus: KYLE]
This feel like my chance
This feel like my moment
Everyone needs a fan
Everyone needs a close up
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
No body's a no one
