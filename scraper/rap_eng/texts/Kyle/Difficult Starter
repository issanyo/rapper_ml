Difficult Starter - Kid
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since i been back
The past, comes back
I try so hard to not
Have it as fact
But in black and white
Since I was born iv
Been having to fight
Family never tried
Too focused on wine
Fighting all the time
But dont feel so sorry im fine
Been in fostercare since day one
My whole life realising I was alone
But in my mind i was shown
Intj running through ma soul
Perfect lifestyle to allow
Me to grow from so much pain an anger
Only use it to make myself stronger
An you want me tell you how I know
God is real truely its no big deal
Allow yourself to take in this perspective
Now we are all made up of the same thing
As the planets and birds which sing
Have you ever tried visialisaing flying
Well, take in this perspective
Why does beauty effect us
How do you feel when the stars reviel
Free will, the universe too big too make big deals
Out of lifes ordeals
Gratitude of life now matter circumstance
Have faith you can do it and give yourself the chance
Start to believe, in yourself, then you'll start to see
Life reviel, oppertunties
Dont conciel, see the fate you chose to feel
Break out before they make you kneel
Only say this to the ones i care
Difficult life, in difficult time
Difficult place, was a difficult kid
Difficult set  no more cards left
When will I be able to put this to rest
Yeah
An its been a difficult starter
But its only made me harder
Smarter, calmer, faster, stronger
I wonder, how we were made from thounder
An born in water, how emotions code the alaphabet order
Of its information embedded in the molecular structure
You can learn from anything you see, coz life is a refection g
Of how you choose to use your belief system you see
Our ideas innatly come from our intuition, fuck religion
Im talking about conciousness, and the onenous
Our atoms, are made the same as the entire system
So coincidence will always happen
So the entire system, has had faith and guilded us to see it this way
Understand how fear of god creates, too much hate
But truth in god makes it hard to hate
The way we made us this way
Let me say that again
Truth in god
Makes it hard
To hate the
Way we
Made
Us
This way
Never knew how to pray
Until I gained faith, in science
Then I was enlightended
On how to be guided
By your trueself, no corporret cell
But right now it feels im living in hell
For now thats all im gonna share
Because if you dont rate this
It wasn't for you to hear...
