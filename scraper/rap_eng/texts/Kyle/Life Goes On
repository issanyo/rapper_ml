[Intro]
[?]

[Chorus: K.I.D.]
They always seem like they're always long gone
Life still goes on and on and on and on and on
They always seem like they're always long gone
Life still goes on and on and on and on and on

[Verse 1: K.I.D.]
Well I'm a teenage rapper, who hangs out with actors
And draws in his free time [?] beehive
Doesn't like his dad, and sings like an angel
Ant tells everyone to suck like Kurt Angel
Yeah I'm doing my thing
I double freaking [?] people support me like a gang
Always on top of my game, never hit the bottom
Cuz my money is [?] like leaves in the autumn
[?]
Hold my team up like a belt
Now I kind of sucks because I'm so hot
If I stop spitting cold flows I'm gonna melt
I know I need help, I'm going to marry a nurse
[?] so what's the word? what's the word?... Oh right, perfect
K.I.D. you haters know I'm worth it though

[Chorus: K.I.D.]
They always seem like they're always long gone
Life still goes on and on and on and on and on
They always seem like they're always long gone
Life still goes on and on and on and on and on

[Verse 2: Micah Bullis]
Kyle, Kyle, Kyle Harvey (what)
I'm gonna tell you how much weed I smoked
[?] young nigga with the lace [?]
K.I.D. back behind the camera man, with a mic in hand
Back in our zone again
I'm getting high with my southern californians
Shoutout to [?] got the [?] smash [?]
Roll it up and pass it down to Ceelo pass it down to [?] pass it down to [?]
If he in the mood he can smoke it up then pass to me [?]
Nigga I'm lit, eyes so low [?]
Hey, what can I say?
The high life is what we chose fully

[Chorus: K.I.D.]
They always seem like they're always long gone
Life still goes on and on and on and on and on
They always seem like they're always long gone
Life still goes on and on and on and on and on

[Verse 3:?]
Every single day
Every single day
Every single day
Life is a game , but I'm read to claim all that I can
[?]
I'm so strong, keep my money long
Hope it goes on every station
[?]

[Chorus: K.I.D.]
They always seem like they're always long gone
Life still goes on and on and on and on and on
They always seem like they're always long gone
Life still goes on and on and on and on and on

[Outro: K.I.D.]
How was that?
