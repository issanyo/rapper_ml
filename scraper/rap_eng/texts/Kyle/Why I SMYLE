I smile because I'm real
I smile cause you niggas don't know how that feels
I smile because I'm here
I smile cause I was looking for a hero and I found that nigga standing in the mirror
I smile because you're average
I smile cause I did a fucking back flip
I smile cause I'm Facebook married to a bad bitch
I smile because I finally got my mom a mattress and now I won't lose no more sleep
Man, that's sick
I smile cause other niggas can't
I smile because maybe I can show them that they can, you know?
I smile because, because I'm not fucking dead
I smile because I could have been a janitor instead
Smile because I'm me
I smile because I'm free
I smile cause every day I get to breath
I smile because I make a snaggle tooth kid believe
He can smile every time I show my teeth
So why not smile?
