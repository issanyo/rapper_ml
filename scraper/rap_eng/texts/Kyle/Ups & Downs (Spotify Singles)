[Intro]
Yeah
Yep, ayy
Yep
Hey Kyle, look over here

[Verse 1]
Hey Kyle, how you doin'?
What are these dream you're pursuin'?
What are these feelings you mention?
Are you from a different dimension?
My nigga, do you have dementia?
Why is you rappin' 'bout happy?
Think about all the bad shit that happens
Look, you know that inside, you feel crappy
Okay, yeah, how did you guess?
Skrrt, I am a wreck
I set a record for bein' upset
Truthfully, honestly, I am a mess
I am depressed, I am obsessed
With self-deprecating and blamin' myself
Socially lyin', denyin' the help
I'm holdin' up like pants missing a belt
Yo, but it ain't so bad
I mean, c'mon, look what I be on
I'm on TV, mom
My nigga, I am a phenom
My chick is out o' this world
Yeah, badder than Zenon
When I need somebody to lean on
I put that Cudi CD on
In my spare time
Punchin' walls, fuckin' up my hand
I know that shit sounds super cray
But if you had this life, you'd understand

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, everything's a lot o' up and down
Yeah, but I ain't gonna let it get me down
No (no no)

[Riff]
Woo!
Mhm, yeah
Yeah, mhm
True story

[Verse 2]
2016 hit me like a bag o' bricks, yup
2017 switched up, like ooh it's lit
I nearly had a mental breakdown
And eight months later had a hit
I guess life is like box a chocolates, huh
You never know what you finna get
Haha, yeah
Think about this 'fore your flip
There's always two sides o' the coin
Tell my man you gotta keep goin'
You blessed nigga, you don't even know it
Sittin' there, lookin' all stoic, hmm
Bein' stiff, you should be stoked, hmm
You can smile, even if you broke, yo
You could be a Budden or a Boat, true
Trust me, believe me, I been there too
Down on my luck, I was just like you
Singin' the same damn sad old songs
Boo hoo
But you'll be fine
It'll all be fine
It's just in your mind
Yep

[Interlude]
Mhm, woo
Woo, woo
Improv freestyle, um

[Verse 3]
Yes, check it out, you're blessed, look
You find yourself in a mess
It's just a test, yo
Yo, you can switch it up, yo
Get a different result, yo
Yo I know this shit hurts, but
Tomorrow it won't, yeah
Learned that from my girl, yeah
Yo, she's my whole world, yeah
Check out my curls, yeah
They're just like her curls, yeah
I don't get girls, yeah
But my heart's strong, yeah
Gotta get along, yeah
Look, gotta keep goin', yeah
Yeah, you gotta go forward, yeah
Nigga gotta keep movin', yeah
Look, if you ain't smilin' my nigga you losin', yeah
Hey

[Riff]
Haha
Woo!
Yeah, woo
Saucy, yes
There you go

[Outro]
Yeah it's ups
And downs
Yeah it's ups
And downs-or I could've called this something like
It's smiles, and frowns
Yeah, it's smiles, and frowns
'Kay, it's highs, ayy
And lows
Yeah, sunny ass beaches
And then there's snow, ayy
Yeah it's dark, and light
Shit gets real dim, then it gets bright, yeah
Shit gets real grim, it's outta sight, yeah
Invader Zim, yo that show is tight, yeah
I- haha, that's good, aight
