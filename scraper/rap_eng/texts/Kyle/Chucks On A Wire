[Verse 1: K.i.D]
Alright, I'm super, duper, duper, laced up
Used to hate us, now we got some vans, everybody switched their face up
Me and Mr. Man, these niggas is like damn
Flows dope, eyes low like a nigga from Japan
All I hear is "I want you" like I'm talking to Uncle Sam
Energizer bunny this ain't ever gonna stop
Cause even whens it's hot, yeah even when it's hot
I keep it cool, like I'm naked sitting infront of a fan

[Verse 2: Mr. Man]
Nigga I keep this shit hotter then Movaje, trying to copy what we do
Mr. Man and K.i.D is here, we came to break the rules
Take them lames to school, re-make them
You came with your girlfriends and my niggas here to take 'em
Finally in the building, nigga fuck a reservation
On the roof with it, welcome to the celebration
(Celebrating like I just hit the lotto. Eat these beef like I don't need to swallow, you follow?)

[Verse 3: K.i.D]
Alright, well shout out to that nigga that just turned 18
Wearing leather Chuck T's with some fucked up teeth
Cause the shit I spit is just to motherfucking much to handle
Gun that don't jam and never run out of ammo

[Vers 4: Mr. Man]
Now suck on that you bitch ass trick, motion pic, on some Menace 2 Society shit
They asking for some real niggas, we providing and shit
Eyes low but I feel like I can get higher then this
(Sooo ummm... I'm taking off like a plane do)
They say the higher you make it, the more that this game with change you
(But I ain't changing for shit) Shit got that right
Cause you can go home by the mic and make no hits
And ya'll niggas dehydrated cause ya'll can't spit
Real talk you niggas neep to stop
Being that weak niggas is crying I think im callin the cops
