[Verse 1: KYLE]
Alright well she thinks I'm in love right
Well, I mean, fuck
I shouldn't have gave her that hug, right?
When it comes down to it
Every girl in the world wants me though
Nigga I can look good in a speedo
No lie I can see it in her eyes
She wants D.i.K from K.i.D doe
Way on top of my A game
Everyone else way lame
Your style has been gone
You arrived on that late train
You think you're cool like fake chains
Niggas ain't foreally doe
And ain't nobody fuckin' with you
Fake brands of cereal
And I know what these girls think
They can just fuck with my brain
And make me do what they say
But they can't
I know 'cause I'm way on top of my flow
And shes has nuthing that's inside
So I'm out the window
Yeah
I don't do really girls who do nothin' but gossip
Try to say some nice things
Your breath stinks
When you talk shit and that's real

[Verse 2: KYLE]
Alright well it's K dot I dot D dot damn
Niggas know that I'm so for real
I always kill and I'm always trill
And I'm always something these niggas feel
I am way up over your head still
I'm stacked up with bread still
You're headed nowhere like running on a treadmill
Niggas FxL is my team yo
Nothin' comes In between bro
Super Mitch and Super Chris
Theyre all addicted to weed though
I am addicted to gettin it by any and all means
I'm not addicted to girls but they're addicted to me
Maybe because I got sumthing inside
K.i.D is a hell of a guy
You're hell of irrelevant, dealing with I
I'm Super Duper, nigga right?
Right!
Oh yeah
Skinny niggas runnin' shit

[Outro]
I'm the fuckin' best that's ever fuckin' lived in life haha
TEXAS HAUS! TRILL NIGGA!
CHOP & SCREW DAT, SUPER DUP THAT! AGH!
