[Intro]
(Ha! Hol' up B, mutated ass puppy)
'K one more, my bad

[Verse]
Wakin' up inside my bed
Lookin' around at all I have
The only thing missin' is what I want
Wipe my eyes, then make my bed
Brush my teeth, and fix my hair
Wash my face, and put that smile on
When did bein' me become so hard?
I've walked so many miles with my head aimed at the ground
I forgot the world had clouds (clouds, clouds, clouds, clouds)
If I could just look up, I'd see him lookin' down
I know my grandpa's proud
I am my brother's keeper, I'll be right there for my sister
I know it took me some time, but I'm the man inside my house
I'm better than I think, I'm stronger than I know
I know I love myself, I love myself (I love myself)
Nights like this with love on my mind
I'm dyin' to find it when I open my eyes
I know it's there, maybe I'm just wastin' my time
But it never hurts to try (yeah)
Lovin' every heart except mine
Keepin' to myself however I feel inside
I guess I'll just keep tellin' myself that I'm fine
Remember it's all alright (yeah, ohh)
All alright (ooh, yeah)
