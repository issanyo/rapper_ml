[Intro: Rockboy K9]
Inside of a world, inside of a world
We forgot all those things we've been fighting for
This happened before, this happened before
Now we right back A1
Doing the same shit for love
And our dreams, I see the promised land
I see gold all on my neck
I see 0's all on my check
I'm God, I'm God
I just want you to see me

[Hook: Rockboy K9]
In the Photoshop of life
Don't let nothing cover my eyes
Don't let shades cover my soul
Don't let nothing cover this gold
I want you to see me, I want you to see me yeah

[Verse 1: Rockboy K9]
Why can't we all be encased in silver and gold?
I can't fold it all, especially the dough
Waking up and set everything that I've ever dreamed
A good way to help others, must help my self-esteem
I woke up in the Bugatti, fell out in the Porsche
They told me I was a leader, so they gave me the torch
I burn your city, get everything that you've ever known
I do it slower than slow so we can see it all go
I let my feelings detach and tell my brothers I got 'em
Keep it in pocket, like parties and condoms
I just want the world to see it's really real forever
I ain't saying they can't do it, they just can't do it better
Be great, be great! Yeah

[Verse 2: Kyle]
Lighter watches
Sweaters decked in gold
Don't mean nothing if
They outshine your soul
I know it
See, I've always been something
The world doesn't try to
Something to follow the light to
Told them to be what's inside you, yeah
And I feel awesome, I feel awesome
Oh I feel awesome, I feel great
No one had to change me
No one had to train me cause
I am what made me

[Hook: Kyle]
In the Photoshop of life
Don't let nothing cover my eyes
I don't want no shades all on my soul
Want nothing hot on this gold
I want you to see me, I want you to see me

[Bridge: Rockboy K9]
Gold all on my neck
I see 0's all on my check, I'm God

[Hook: Kyle]
In the Photoshop of life
Don't let nothing cover my eyes
I don't want no shades all on my soul
Want nothing hot on this gold
I want you to see me, I want you to see me
