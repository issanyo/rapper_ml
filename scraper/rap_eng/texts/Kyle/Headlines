[Verse]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I know they know that I'm
The fucking best thats ever lived
Yeah, yeah
This is completely unrehearsed
Well it's that K
I never die and truthfully I never lie
And these niggas like penguins, why?
Cause they never fly
Swagger's on 34 mill times 69
Niggas couldn't see me even if they had 60 eyes
Flow is so cold it that it kinda hurts to flow
When I let these flows go it's like I'm spittin' freakin bricks of ice
I'm out here gettin' it these niggas need to get it right
Turnin' supermen to little boys, spittin' kryptonite
Army full of fully laced zombies we never die
I'm keep on spitting at these haters 'till my lips is dry
Leave 'em all drowning have 'em bowing to this 155 pounds of astounding
Never miss a shot but hey if I miss a shot
I'm a be the first one off the ground rebounding
Yeah you're now fucking with that fully laced fam again
Spitting all that ohh ohh damn is they damaging
Hammering K-I-double D and Mr. Man again
Making you niggas scared to move like mannequin
About to go Yoda on these dudes start panicking
Yeah I got that force in me you can call me Anakin
I'm managing to managing every type of insanity
And put it all on paper to make it make me a salary
Clothes are immaculate, my pockets high in calories
I ain't got no handle bars, y'all niggas can't handle me
A young dude did it all by myself so
Don't believe anyone who said they tried to help, no
No one but me gave me guidance
So who made me who I am? I did
And ain't nobody gonna take that shit away
We might die tomorrow but I'm killing it today
It's Mr. fucking Man and K-I-double D
Been obliterating beats since before the 3rd grade
They know, they know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know, they know
That I'm so super duper cold, yeah yeah
Somebody turn the heater on, because my flow is oh so vicious
And, yeah, it'll leave you sleeping with the fishes
I'm just killin' shit, killin' shit every fuckin day
K-I-double fucking D, niggas know that I'm so great
Frosted Flakes, no, no, no, no
That's just me, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
And you know the shit I do is oh so vicious
Leave you sleeping with the fishes
Yeah this shit is repetitious, that means twice
(I be yelling out money over everything money on my mind, mind, mind)
Money over everything, fuck I didn't know that was coming
(Tell em I apologize happened over time, time, time)
But fuck it cuz I think Drake's super cool
My head's spinnin' like a school
Yeah, cuz I'm a motherfucking genius
Yeah, this is some shit you've never seen bitches
Love K.i.D, and everytime they see me these panties come off
Nah just kidding K.i.D I got it, no none of this shit is written
And you know I'm always scratching down these beats like a kitten
I just put my clothes into things K.i.D. I got it and uhhhh
