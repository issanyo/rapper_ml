Well there's this girl and she's fly
She's so into this guy
I know that I'm better
If she can see what's inside
She sees jordan's and nike's
I see that shit in her eyes
Materialism on the highest degree
The type of girl who gets married
Just for the ring
Dog!
But That shit dont faze me
He might be cool but I'm amazing
And yeah cuz might be swoll
But at least
I know how to show my soul

I Said I know I have sumthing inside
You can't get from these other guys
I know I have sumthing inside
You can't get from these other guys
You'll never find it no matter where you look
You can't just learn it from opening a book
You can search for all your life
You'll never find what I have inside

Yeah cuz I'm cool
Fresher then the first day of school
I spend my days observing things
And making all the lady's drool
Or I think I am
Shes to busy thinking of her man
That guy thats so damn oh fuck kablam
And I'm to shy to even ask
Like how you doin how you doin
How ya been how ya been
I say hi to you evryday
And you dont know who the fuck I am

But I know I have sumthing inside
You can't get from these other guys
I know I have sumthing inside
You can't get from these other guys
You'll never find it no matter where you search
You don't know your soul and I'll bet that hurts
You can search for all your life
You'll never find what I have inside

You can search wherever you want to
But The truth is too many people
Have forgoten what it means to have a soul
And I'll doubt you"ll find anyone who
Does
