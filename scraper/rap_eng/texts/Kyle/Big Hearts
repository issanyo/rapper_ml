[Verse 1: KYLE]
Yeah I
I'm tired of lettin' you down
It happens so often now
I can't tell if you want me around

[Chorus: KYLE]
'Cause right now I'm just someone with a big heart (Big heart)
For someone with dark spots in they hearts
I'm just someone with a big heart (Big heart)
For someone with dark spots in they hearts
Yah

[Post-Chorus: KYLE]
Ayy but my phone never, my phone never stops ringin'
No my phone never, my phone never stops ringin', ring
I know I should
Be there when you need me to
And if I could
I, I'd be callin' you
I, yeah, I'd be callin' you (Hello?)
I'd be callin' you (What's up?)

[Verse 2: KYLE]
I'm tired of hearing that sound
Your heart makes when I leave town, yeah yeah
You know I'd change if I knew how
But my shit's so crazy now
Yeah, I don't even have to try (To try)
I'm such an unlikable guy, yeah, yeah
But you don't even have to care (To care)
It's so unfair

[Chorus: KYLE]
I'm just someone with a big heart (Big heart)
For someone with dark spots in they hearts
I'm just someone with a big heart (Big heart)
For someone with dark spots in they hearts
Yah

[Post-Chorus: KYLE]
Ayy but my phone never, my phone never stops ringin'
No my phone never, my phone never stops ringin', ring
I know I should
Be there when you need me to
And if I could
I, I'd be callin' you
Big heart
(What's up?)
Big heart
(Hello?)
Big heart
(What's up?)
Hey, hey, I'd be callin' you (Hello?)
Yeah, yeah, I'd be callin' you (What's up?)
Ooh, I'd be callin' you (Hello?)
I'd be callin' you (What's up?)

[Outro: KYLE]
