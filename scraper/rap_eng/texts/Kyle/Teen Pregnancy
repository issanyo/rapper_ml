[Verse 1]
You wouldn't believe the things that I know
To touch you [?] and turn you on
You think you do, but you really don't
You think you do, but you really don't
It's 10:43 I know you should be home
I'm outside your door you should pick up your phone
And take out that launderie put that shit on
And take out that launderie put that shit on

[Chorus]
The way you look
The things you say
The way you're shaped (That's that shit that drives me crazy)
(Crazy, crazy)
(That's that shit that drives me crazy)
(Crazy, crazy)
Really it's okay, we don't need clothes anyway
Don't need clothes anyway, we don't need clothes anyway, babe
Really it's okay, we don't need clothes anyway
You can leave 'em at that door, get what I have in store babe

[Verse 2]
There's no reason to feel shy
Lay back on your bed close your eyes babe
What's inside, babe, inside, babe, me, yeah

[Chorus]
The way you look
The things you say
The way you're shaped (That's that shit that drives me crazy)
(Crazy, crazy)
(That's that shit that drives me crazy)
(Crazy, crazy)
Really it's okay, we don't need clothes anyway
Don't need clothes anyway, we don't need clothes anyway, babe
(Crazy, crazy)
(That's that shit that drives me crazy)
(Crazy, crazy)
(That's that shit that drives me crazy)
(Crazy, crazy)
(That's that shit that drives me crazy)
(Crazy, crazy)
