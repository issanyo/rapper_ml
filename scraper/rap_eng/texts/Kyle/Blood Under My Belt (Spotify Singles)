[Intro]
Now uh, before I start singin'
Little background, I- um
First of all, shout out to The Drums
I- um, I walked past Johnny at uh- Coachella
He performed there
And I knew he was, bro!
But I was just like hella nervous so I didn’t say "What's up?" to him
But, I mean he's the shit
So you know, hopefully he hear this song and then will fuck with me
’Cause I really fuck with him
But, you know, you'll never know
Also, shouts out to my shawty for putting me on
And uh, yeah, let's get it
What does it take-
Alright, I'll come in the next one
Ok, my bad, I lied, this one, haha

[Chorus]
What does it take for you to believe that I have changed?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Mmm, yes, it's true, I hurt you
But I still love you, I love you, I still do
What did I say to make you want to run away?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Mmm, yes, look, I hurt you
But I still love you, I love you, I still do, ooh

[Verse 1]
I see death coming at me too quickly
I don't want this to end
I take an apple from the tree we planted together
I hold it in my hand

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I said "change"
But please don't change
I know I said "do it"
But don't do it, don’t do it

[Chorus]
What does it take for you to believe that I have changed?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Mmm, and yes, it’s true, look, I hurt you
But I still love you, I love you, I still do
What did I say to make you want to run away?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Mmm, yes, it's true, yes it’s true, that I hurt you
But I still love you, I love you, I still do

[Verse 2]
I am scared of the child that lives in me
I don't know if he learns (he's a slow learner, you know what I mean?)
You left your t-shirt under the bed we shared together
I put it over my face, hmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Look, and there was a "change"
But please don't change it
I know what you "do it"
But don’t do it, don't do it

[Chorus]
What does it take for you to believe that I have changed?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Ooh, yes, it's true, yes it's true, that I hurt you
But I still love you, I love you, I still do
What did I say to make you want to run away?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Ooh, yes, it's true, yes it's true that I hurt you
But I still love you, I love you, I still do

[Interlude]
Ok, improv verse for the good people at home
For the fuck of it, aight look

[Verse 3]
Look, ok, my bad, it's hard to not be my dad
It's hard to not miss your calls
It's hard to not text hoes back
It's not hard, it's really easy, see?
But a piece of me is still 17
Cry about shit like I'm 7 or 6
And respond to your text like I'm 73
You still won't stop messaging me
Still put so much effort in me
Don't give me wrong, it's a really good song
But I still ain't learn how to step to the beat
Two left feet tappin' away, sayin' I'm somethin' I actually ain't
We both know it's all for the show
But hey, just wait

[Outro]
One day, I'ma be sick as hell
Like in a good way
I'ma be the best boyfriend you ever had
I'm gettin' there, I'm workin' at it
Bear with me
Haha, aight tight
