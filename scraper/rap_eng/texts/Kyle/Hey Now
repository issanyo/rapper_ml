[Verse 1: Martin Solveig]
I'm all alone now, check it out
Me and you should take a vacay
I got a plan now, we're going out
Save you whining for another day
Here's the thing I wanna talk about
Listen all, you gotta hear me out
We get it done, we get it done, my own way
I just wanna say
Wait!

[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now
I haven't had a good laugh for a day now
Hey now, hey now
You know you're down, let's do this right now
Hey now, hey now
Up top, we're the kings of the playground
Hey now, hey now
You know you're down, let's do this right now

[Post-Chorus]
Do this right now
Wait!
Let's do this right now

[Verse 2: Kyle]
What's the holdup, take your clothes off, there's a game
In the pillows, or on Nintendo, it don't matter, we can play
Sing da-na-na-na, it's the summer, got exotic, catch the rays, ay
Sun is never going down, oh we have all day (Wait!)
Baby you're tanned completely
Really, I don't mean to sound cheesy, it's way too easy
You can wear it up in a beanie
It's so hot out, looks slazy, it's weird
And this day's amazing
I'll bet we can make it
Your pop, left the beemer
I think we should take it, yeah

[Chorus]
Hey now (yeah yeah), hey now
I haven't had a good laugh for a day now (ha ha, I)
Hey now, hey now
You know you're down, let's do this right now
Hey now, hey now
Up top, we're the kings of the playground
Hey now, hey now
You know you're down, let's do this right now

[Post-Chorus]
Do this right now
Wait!
We're the kings of the playground

[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now
Up top, we're the kings of the playground
Hey now, hey now
You know you're down, let's do this right now
