[Intro]
Okay, whatever
Okay, whatever
Okay, whatever
Okay, whatever
Okay, whatever
Whatever, whatever

[Verse 1]
So I sent her ass a text right
And she ain't send shit back
And she really hates rap so I thought
Well maybe it's because I'm black
Or maybe cuz I look like an anorexic wolf
Who crawled up out of a bush
And she says it's not that
And it's not because you're black
It's because we don't match
Like a fucking dumb nigga and a book, right

[Chorus]
Maybe if I was perfect
You would think I'm worth it
You would think I'm worth it
Worth it
You want it all
You want it all
If I was Drake, you would let me say
[?] my fucking name Harvey so I'll never fade away
Never fade away, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, whatever the fuck you say
"Oh c'mon babe" nah fuck that
GIve me all of my stuff and my five bucks back
Give me all that "it wasn't enough" back, yeah
It's not me, it's you, trust that
Yeah, you're the one with the problems
So don't point your finger at I
'Cuz I'm just the guy who couldn't solve 'em, right

[Chorus]
Maybe if I was perfect
You would think I'm worth it
You would think I'm worth it
Worth it
You want it all
You want it all
If I was Drake, you would let me say
[?] my fucking name Harvey so I'll never fade away
Never fade away, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, one time for the guys who be tryna act nice
To these shallow ass girls everywhere
Two times for the nigga that be going
Way way out of his way but his girl never cares
Three times for the guy who be calling every night
But for some reason she ain't ever there
And none for the dumbass girls who are
More in love with the curls and the hair

[Chorus]
Maybe if I was perfect
You would think I'm worth it
You would think I'm worth it (none for the dumbass girls who are)
Worth it
You want it all (how you love some fucking hair)
You want it all
If I was Drake, you would let me say
[?] my fucking name Harvey so I'll never fade away
Never fade away, yeah
Yeah
