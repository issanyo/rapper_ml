Kyle,Uh
Verse 1
Young spitta, big hitta/
T Dots own Jose Bautista/
Spit by the liter, drown any nigga/
That come against me, asphyxiate under pressure/
North side repper, Eastside representer/
Bound to never fall like lepers/
Or high rise jumpers, that boy quite skilled/
In manipulating words, them girls get thrilled/
Still, so nonchalant/
Rap savant flow avant garde
Soon to reach the T-O-P/
Then you'll catch me, and my peeps spending G's in Paris/
They find it hard to breathe when I flow Fabulous/
Lee over beats, soon to be cashin in/
Talen, Ted like Wahlberg, Father/
Can only do right, come test with the author/

Chorus
Hot Flows, yeah I'm bout dat/
Just the bass bangin, man we off dat/
You said you got rhymes, show me where they at/
Oh that weak 16, man that shit was whack/
Like mobsters, you know how we conquer/
God knows that we will never falter/
You are now entering the danger zone/
