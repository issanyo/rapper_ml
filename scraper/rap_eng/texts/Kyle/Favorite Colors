[Verse 1: Taylor Bennett]
Waking up cigarette smoke
Then its back to these hopes of me packing out crowds
Used to keep head in the clouds
Reaching for stars as I break down some loud
Been moving so slow like I really need more
But them thoughts that I seek not allowed
Like how I could reach and perform
Is so foreign to me while I'm swimmed in this crowd
I need them VMA's it's in my DNA
I ain't no deity but I still contemplate
Complicate, conversate, me on that BET
MTV, what that shit meant for me
More than just rent for me, symphonies
More than just energy
That's no epiphany
Reach by this piff of weed
I'm talking destiny, demons they wrestle me
Fuck any recipe, labels collection me
I'm talking destiny

[Chorus: Luke Tennyson]
I can't afford
Not the lifestyle that I live for
Like I thought before
Feelin' like I can’t ignore this
Relying on a star, show me your favorite colors

[Verse 2: Kyle]
I wasn't much of a mathlete
Even less of an athlete
Wait actually, I take it back
I was busting ass at the track meet
Going and going and going and going
Just running from all of my problems
With zero intentions of stopping
Yup, until they got too big to solve em
I got a thing for waiting to make a decision
Until I'm fresh out of options
"Come in! God, do you copy?"
I'm having these episodes hoping that somebody's watching
But I always felt awesome
I always knew nothing could stop me
Even when dinner was ramen, ramen, or ramen
I always knew nothing could top me
I'm good

[Chorus: Luke Tennyson]
I can't afford
Not the lifestyle that I live for
Like I thought before
Feelin' like I can’t ignore this
Relying on a star, show me your favorite colors
