[Intro]
(Telephone ringing)
Hello?

[Verse 1]
Oh no (Fuck, here we go again, what?)
Here we go again with the dumb shit
Cussin' me out on assumption (Where the facts at?)
Supposed to be the one I have fun with (Not fun with ya)
It's not fun with ya (It's just not fun, no)
Oh no, here we go again with the blaming (Really, you gon' blame me for that shit?)
With the I'm the one changin'
I'm gonna be just like my Dad
Tell me babe how could you say this? (How you gon' say that?)
You're not Raven
(You're not a psychic)

[Hook]
You said you'd be happy (You would be happy)
That smile on your face is fake as mine (That sure is fake, yo)
You knew this would happen
So did I
I don't know who to blame
I don't know who to blame
(We should both stop playing games)
I don't know who to blame
I don't know who to blame

[Verse 2]
Oh lord (What's up?)
Here we go again with you leavin' (Are you for real this time, or...)
I ain't know this was the ship jump season (Well I guess I do now, huh)
If you're gonna hate me at least have a reason (That's the least you could after everything a nigga did for ya, I mean)
Hmm... (No, no, no, no, no) Now you call me on the weekend (Can you stop wasting all my time please)
Are we good, are we good, yo, this shit is misleading (Can you just make up your motherfuckin' mind please)
Keep it real with each other is the only thing we can
It's my weakness

[Hook]
You said you'd be happy (You would be happy)
That smile on your face is fake as mine (That sure is fake, yo)
You knew this would happen
So did I
I don't know who to blame
I don't know who to blame
(We should both stop playing games)
I don't know who to blame
I don't know who to blame

[Bridge]
Just blame me
Just blame me
Just blame me
Just blame me
Just blame me
Just blame me

[Instrumental Outro]
