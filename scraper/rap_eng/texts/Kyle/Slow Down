[Verse 1]
This girl here, yeah
She really had my mind blown
Made me lose my head, I can't find where my mind go
Anxious to find out what she gon’ do behind doors
Shine like a supernova, see her with my eyes closed
Out from the red, she got a different taste
She just scooped an ice cream, sittin' on her bed late
Go watch her all night, make me go to bed late
And keep her runnin' through my mind until I get a headache
Because her body is bangin’, legs are athletic
Feet are somethin', please somebody call a medic
She got me on my knees, yeah it's borderline pathetic
I don't care, I'm in L-O-V-E
There I said it, I'm in love with a stripper
And if she come close, then I swear I'ma tip her
Yeah, I'ma kiss her, well
Maybe not, but damn baby slow down
She goin’ too fast, I’m like "damn baby, stop"
Just slow down

[Chorus]
I know what you want with me (I know now)
You ain't that easy to see (Just slow down)
I know what you want with me (I know now)
You ain’t that easy to see (Just slow down)
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down

[Verse 2]
Just slow down, whoa now
Baby gettin' crazy, it's a showdown
You can be my first and even lady if you want to
I don't want to feel no pressure but I want you
Try to get to know me better
Eat and sit down, suddenly and put me in your schedule
And I’ma make it rain for you, just gon' be your wedding man
Yeah, she love me with or without money
She laugh at my jokes even if they ain't funny
I mean no jokin', baby it's so smokin'
I'm gettin' so toasted so I was so hopin'
You would be so open to take it easy
Start squeezin', baby and get your E break
Take a D lane, pause a second
And try to [?] it up, drain down 'fore you wreck it
Smash it or crash it, I just don't wanna trash it
As long you got a [?], you makin' me want [?]
On, like an NFL touchdown
You be the first one I call when I touch down
All these texts you sendin' is too much
Now let me love you slow-mo, there's no mean to rush now

[Chorus]
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down
I know what you want with me (I know now)
You ain't that easy to see (Just slow down)
I know what you want with me (I know now)
You ain't that easy to see (Just slow down)
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down
