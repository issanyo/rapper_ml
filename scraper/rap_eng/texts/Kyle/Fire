I spy a little cute chick
A girl i can get cause she can't get any kicks
A curly headed wifey, she dont give a shit

They tryna be cool and they tryna be dabbers
Im wearing a black hat and some black clothes
Im tan, so that means im with the flow

[Elmo]
She said she 16 hope yall rap
All my bitches gave me a pair of balls on my lap aye
Turn up in here bitch my bars so lit
If that means yes than i guess you gonna get hit
My rhymes so fire like Z-Zane!
