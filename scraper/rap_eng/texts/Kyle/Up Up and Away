[Intro]
Up-up and away, ayy
Up-up and away, ayy
Up-up and away, ayy
Up-up and away, ayy
Up-up and away
Up-up and away
Up-up and away
Up-up and away, yeah
So this song right here, this song changed my life, okay? Hopefully it does the same for you

[Verse 1]
Now when the sun come up
I'll be there to say what's up, in the morning
Brush my teeth
Find that clip I been looking for since last night
I feel so caught up, in the bud
I float around in my bedroom
Turn around
See my face in the mirror, I guess I'm cool
And those happy thoughts, in my head
I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan
Minus the tights and fairies
Happy to see how far it's come
To the same place, it began
My dreams, imagination
Perfectly at peace
So I move along a bit higher

[Hook]
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
Cause, they gon' judge me anyway
So, whatever
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
Cause in the end they'll judge me anyway
So, whatever

[Verse 2]
Higher learnin'
I see the dreams I made
So I'm cooler now
I can take care of my mom and my little niece Zuri
So sing along lil mama
You ain't gotta worry 'bout no drama, no
I provide for friends and fam and fans
And keep the City grinding, man
Stay afloat
The key is hope
I never let a motherfucka break me, dawg
Who gives a fuck?
If a nigga don't like your steeze
Tell 'em to buzz off your n-u-t's
We don't care what people say
Dudes who critique your clothes are most gay
I ain't gotta wait for no one
If I wanna fly, I can fly for freedom, sing it!

[Hook]
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
Cause, they gon' judge me anyway
So, whatever
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
Cause in the end they'll judge me anyway
So, whatever
