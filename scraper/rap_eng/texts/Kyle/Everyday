[Intro: KYLE]
Everyday, yeah-yeah
Right

[Chorus: The Americanos]
She got love for me, she flyin' in from overseas
Three’s a crowd she bring a friend to keep us company
I can't help it if I got these tings all over me
Everyday, everyday
She got love for me, she flyin' in from overseas
I got it all ’cause once they come, they never wanna leave
I can't help it if I got these tings all over me
Everyday, everyday

[Verse 1: DRAM]
Not one, not two, not three, not four, not five (not five, not five)
Ten out of ten, agree that you're a dime (a dime)
You look so good, you just be turning heads (heads)
So ladylike, 'til we jump in the bed (the bed, the bed, the bed)
In between the sheets, it's just you and I (and I)
But when you reach your peak (yeah), it takes me to the sky (the sky)
You're all that I need, endless supply (yeah)
'Cause you love me right (yeah), everyday and night (ooh)

[Chorus: The Americanos]
She got love for me, she flyin' in from overseas
Three’s a crowd she bring a friend to keep us company
I can’t help it if I got these tings all over me
Everyday, everyday
She got love for me, she flyin' in from overseas
I got it all ’cause once they come, they never wanna leave
I can't help it if I got these tings all over me
Everyday, everyday

[Verse 2: KYLE]
Super Duper Kyle to the rescue (to the rescue)
Extraordinary, never extra (never extra)
Hold your hand and grab your ass, I'm ambidextrous (I'm ambidextrous)
Watch your boyfriend disappear for my my next trick
Zoom zoom, tryna give you that boom boom
Girl, you know it’s never too soon
Tryna get that mmm, mmm
Now hooking up in the restroom
I'ma book us the best room
First class that best seat
Girl I know you need leg room
Baby, you're a star no cosign, cosign
I'ma trade my chain for a bow tie, oh I
Call up Super Kyle, baby, I'll be there in no time

[Bridge: DRAM & KYLE]
'Cause you love me right (yeah), everyday and night (ooh)
Everyday, everyday
Everyday
'Cause you love me right (yeah), everyday and night (ooh)

[Chorus: The Americanos]
She got love for me, she flyin' in from overseas
Three's a crowd she bring a friend to keep us company
I can't help it if I got these tings all over me
Everyday, everyday
She got love for me, she flyin' in from overseas
I got it all 'cause once they come, they never wanna leave
I can't help it if I got these tings all over me
Everyday, everyday

[Outro: KYLE, DRAM & The Americanos]
