[Intro]:
Alright look, its unrehearsed
If you don't think its unrehearsed, you can kiss my, yes
We gon' skate to one song, one song only
I drink too much coffee
Aye, aye Mr. Man, one take one take only

[Verse 1: K.i.D]:
I ball so hard mothafuckas wanna sign me, but first niggas gotta find me
Then niggas gotta pay me, then we're cool
If I was them, I would sign me too
Taking niggas out like chinese food
Ya'll small time little rocks, and I'm big business like large suits
Ball so hard like Jay-Z's baby, nigga that shits crazy
Like a crackhead that smokes crack rocks and drinks redbull and has bad rabies
Big arms, little legs, big mouth with a lot to say
Big head with big dreams, big pockets thats big pay
Yeah I sleep at my moms house, yeah I sleep on my moms couch
Yeah I still play videogames and drink mountain dew til' I fall out
Did three shows for three racks in three weeks, thats 9k
Damn nigga I suck at math, and even I know I'm getting paid
Ball so hard these niggas don't want me, to even play
Cause I am too good at this game, k.i.d do this every day
Yeah I got a fucked up haircut, so what nigga so what
With a fucked up tooth I do what I do, and even deaf people hear us
To dope for rehab, I'm always in D lab
I don't smoke, I don't care if you do
Kiss my ass, ball so hard that shits crazy
No thats more then crazy, hey whats more then crazy
