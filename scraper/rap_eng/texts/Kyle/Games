[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Oh I get it, ohh
Y'all niggas thought this was a game, huh?

[Chorus: KYLE]
Yeah
I wanna play real games (Ooh), not no CPU (Ooh)
I wanna rhyme like Busta (What?)
Sing like Usher too (True)
I need a million things (Cars, clothes, whips, cribs, chains)
They all wanna be like me (That's right), play a little RPG (A'ight)
I wanna-I wanna play real games (Ooh), not no CPU (Ooh)
I wanna rhyme like Busta (Yeah)
Sing like Usher too (Yeah)
I need a million things (Cars, clothes, whips, cribs, chains)
They all wanna be like me (Yeah true), play a little RPG (Ooh)
I wanna-I wanna (Yeah)

[Verse: KYLE]
Yeah
Superman ain't got shit
Brand new brands, niggas ain't got this
Young rich nigga, I don't take no Lyfts
Young rich nigga, I don't take no Lyfts
Uber everywhere, Uber everywhere, yeah
No coach seat when I take my trips
Fly to Tokyo nigga, ain't no drift
Real life story nigga, ain't no skit
I'm thinkin' about buying a crib for my mom soon, yeah
I just starred in a movie, I feel like Tom Cruise, yeah
Damn my catalogue is so long, it's colossal
The shit you drop is so old, it look like a fossil
And your bitch still wear Aeropostale (Wow, ooh)
Ooh, make it look easy (Easy)
Neck full of VV's (VV's, VV's)
I'm always on TV
Three different channels, I call it a three-peat (Yeah yeah yeah yeah, whoo)
Whoa, okay (Okay)
Change it again, it's me (It's me)
Yeah, there he go (There he go), that's the lil young niggas E'rybody know (Yeah we know)

[Chorus: KYLE]
I wanna play real games (Ooh), not no CPU (Ooh)
I wanna rhyme like Busta (What?)
Sing like Usher too (True)
I need a million things (Cars, clothes, whips, cribs, chains)
They all wanna be like me (That's right), play a little RPG (A'ight)
I wanna-I wanna play real games (Ooh), not no CPU (Ooh)
I wanna rhyme like Busta (Yeah)
Sing like Usher too (Yeah)
I need a million things (Cars, clothes, whips, cribs, chains)
They all wanna be like me (true), play a little RPG (Ooh)
I wanna-I wanna
