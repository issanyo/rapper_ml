[Verse 1]
Does anyone know? Anyone know at all?
Where did our good times go
Four years of snow ever since you've been gone
We've been a frozen
Oh whoa, credible cold chillin' my soul, oh dee-oh-doe
Oh no, need you don't go feel so alone, oh dee-oh-doe

[Pre-Hook]
You tell me one day the world's gon' need you
And that's might bring you to your knees
Sun is falling, and it's your calling
That you're a star but you can see
Don't lose sight there, there's a light there
And I'll be right there when you need
I'm here to save y'all, please just pray y'all on my way y'all

[Hook]
Need you all to just wait on me
I need you to wait on me
Need you to wait on me
Please can you wait on, wait on, wait on me?
I need y'all to wait on me
I need you to wait on me
Please can you wait on, wait on

[Verse 2]
Trying to break the mold here, keep from growing old here
Closet full of jackets yeah it sucks it always snows here
Living rooms are froze here, you can fucking ice skate
And everybody knows here that nobody should go here
Don't come here, it's bad here
I remember last year, never home, shattered phone
Breaking hella glass here
Damn that was a fast year
Should've got my heart a fuckin' cast year
I'm jumpy cause I'm haunted by past year
And post traumatic past fears
Super duper sad here
Wish I went to church now
Wish I had my gramps here
Really need my dad here
Memories of weeks with the lights off
So now I always keep a fucking lamp near
I'm weird but I'm trying man, I'm motherfuckin' trying
I'm tryna get through this verse without me fucking crying
Suck it up, "You gotta be a man, gotta take care of your fam"
That's what he was saying right before he died

[Pre-Hook]
You tell me one day the worlds gon' need you
And that's might bring you to your knees
Sun is falling, and it's your calling
That you're a star but you can see
Don't lose sight there, there's a light there
And I'll be right there when you need
I'm here to save y'all, please just pray y'all on my way y'all

[Hook]
Need you all to just wait on me
I need you to wait on me
Need you to wait on me
Please can you wait on, wait on, wait on me?
I need y'all to wait on me
I need you to wait on me
Please can you wait on, wait on
