[Verse 1: Kyle]
Fruit snacks and cups of Patron, parties on buses with hoes
Me and my bros on a mission
To leave with your riches, your bitches, and even they clothes
Yeah, I don't know, probably give it to charity or somethin'
Every girl nowadays wanna marry me or somethin'
Hate that shit, all I needed was a pic
But yo ass always sendin' me a narrative or somethin'
Naked pic of tits bitch, I ain't even knowin' it
Boyfriends hate me and I ain't even noticin'
Lemme tie a girl down, I ain't never roll with them
Hella blunts heavy but I'm second hand smoking them
Really real, it's me and Gerald, tell all those lame niggas hide their girls
Going dumb 'till I'm numb, couldn't even tell your ass how this feels
Trying to write a rap when you're drunk is a skill though
Bottles and bars and they're both being killed though
Trying to talk to these bitches is hard
Cause I sound like Boomhauer from King of the Hill though
Girls do wanna come, wanna stay
Sex and Super Smash Bros, hoes wanna play
Truly fuckin' hard and I wasn't trying to party
But ah fuck it, okay, turn up!

[Hook: Devon Baldwin]
I don't know why I get so high
Wake up tomorrow and my whole day has gone by
Doing what the fuck I feel like
Will someone tell me is this real life?
Last night was a movie
I swear last night was a movie
I swear last night was a movie
I swear last night was a movie

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
'Kay, last night was cinematic
I'm a women addict, it's been established
She pulled my shirt then ripped the fabric
Woke up shirtless, just in a jacket
Roll a spliff of cabbage
I'm living lavish, you're living average
This isn't new man, I've been a savage
Rolled every swisher that's in the package
Yeah, I'm just young and blessed
Pass that trash, I'm unimpressed
These hoes get kicked out, that's sudden death
I'm on one, probably could've hung with Hunter S
Now I'm gonezo, cross-faded
Took another shot, should have waited
When tomorrow comes, I'mma hate it
Up until then I'mma make it
My mind is so gone, rollin' up more trying to get in my zone
Fuck goin' out man I'm all good at home
'Bout to call an old girl I know I can bone

[Hook]
I don't know why I get so high
Wake up tomorrow and my whole day has gone by
Doing what the fuck I feel like
Will someone tell me is this real life?
Last night was a movie
I swear last night was a movie
I swear last night was a movie
I swear last night was a movie


[Bridge: G-Eazy]
So faded, so high
So faded, so high
If I do some more I'll pass out on the floor like I'm waving goodbye
So faded, so high
So faded, so high
Every night on tour we all do drugs galore
Man I stay in the sky

[Hook]
I don't know why I get so high
Wake up tomorrow and my whole day has gone by
Doing what the fuck I feel like
Will someone tell me is this real life?
Last night was a movie
I swear last night was a movie
I swear last night was a movie
I swear last night was a movie
