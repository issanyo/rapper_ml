[Chorus]
Even if my girlfriend has a baby (uh huh)
Even if my job don't really pay me (uh huh)
Even if my dad don't ever see me (uh huh)
I won't ever waste my time complaining (uh huh)
It's all alright
I'll be fine, it's all alright
Don't need to whine, it's all alright
If your phone just died, it's all alright
You can borrow mine, it's all alright
I'll be fine, it's all alright
Don't need to whine, we got more wine, it's all alright
If your phone just died, it's all alright
You can borrow mine, it's all alright

[Verse 1]
No nudes in my Snapchat, it's all alright
And uh, I bought the wrong hat, it wasn't a snapback, but yo, it's all alright
Cuz it's just clothes
It's funny how they gunning down niggas over Nikes
That's why I wear Vans, yeah looking tight ain't worth a nigga's life
And I know, and I know, it's not that serious
I don't need 23's on to feel superior
I'd still be happier
Yeah, I'd still be fine
Cuz without the hat or the shoes or the drop top coupe, dude I'm cool, I'm all alright

[Chorus]
Even if my girlfriend has a baby (uh huh)
Even if my job don't really pay me (uh huh)
Even if my dad don't ever see me (uh huh)
I won't ever waste my time complaining (uh huh)
It's all alright
I'll be fine, it's all alright
Don't need to whine, it's all alright
If your phone just died, it's all alright
You can borrow mine, it's all alright
I'll be fine, it's all alright
Don't need to whine, we got more wine, it's all alright
If your phone just died, it's all alright
You can borrow mine, it's all alright

[Verse 2]
Ring, ring, ring, hey what it do?
(Hey fuck you cuh!)
Okay, love you too
Cuz remember, I'm rubber you're glue
It's been fuck what you say
Since the third and fourth grade, okay?
Still they find the time to always call me
Problems at the end of every hallway
I won't ever let it hurt or harm me
I'll be walking, head up, smiling always
Cloudy days don't ever bother me
Hating niggas never go to sleep
Busy trying to keep me up awake
Trying to keep a young'n from his dreams
But I stay snoring just like I should
And even when nobody told me I could
Even if I signed a pub deal with Suge
Knock on wood, I'll be good

[Chorus]
Even if my girlfriend has a baby (uh huh)
Even if my job don't really pay me (uh huh)
Even if my dad don't ever see me (uh huh)
I won't ever waste my time complaining (uh huh)
It's all alright
I'll be fine, it's all alright
Don't need to whine, it's all alright
If your phone just died, it's all alright
You can borrow mine, it's all alright (it's all alright)
I'll be fine, it's all alright (it's all alright)
Don't need to whine, we got more wine, it's all alright
If your phone just died (phone just died), it's all alright
You can borrow mine (it's all alright), it's all alright
I'll be fine, it's all alright
Don't need to whine (it's all), it's all alright
If your phone just died (phone just died), it's all alright
You can borrow mine (borrow mine), it's all alright (yeah)
I'll be fine (I'll be fine), it's all alright
Don't need to whine, we got more wine, it's all alright
If your phone just died, it's all alright
You can borrow mine, it's all alright
