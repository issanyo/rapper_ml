[Intro]
Yeah
Yep yep, yo
Hmm

[Verse 1: KYLE]
So is you coming or going? Hey
I need to know, yeah
'Cause I got no such time to keep things on hold
So are you coming or going? Hey
Let me know
I gotta seat in my ship, it was shaped for your hips
Girl don't let that thing close

[Chorus: KYLE & Take 6]
Zoom zoom, zoom
Zoom zoom, zoom
Zoom zoom, zoom
Zoom zoom, zoom

[Verse 2: KYLE & Take 6]
I won't waste no time witcha
(I won't waste no time witcha)
Grab my hand, let's fly together
(Grab my hand, let's fly together)
I won't waste no time witcha
(I won't waste no time witcha)
Grab my hand, let's fly together
(Grab my hand, let's fly together)

[Outro: Take 6]
