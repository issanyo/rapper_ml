[Verse 1: KYLE]
Run it up
I think I did, did done enough
Yo, and I ain't tryna be that guy
Ay, but I just really think it's that time (it's 'bout time)
The clock tick-tick-ticking
Had me in 30 mile missions
So I hit Jon Bellion to put it in a song
'Cause your lightskinned ass don't listen, listen, listen

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion]
It's 2AM and cold outside
Is it too late to come, oh?
I can't even sleep at night 'cause, oh
It's 3AM, I'm parked outside
I'm walking to your door, oh
And that can't wait another night 'cause, oh

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Oh, twenty-five, twenty-five seven and
I give you all my attention
Baby, you're my obsession
Oh, twenty-five, twenty-five seven and
I give you love and affection
Baby, you're my obsession
Baby, you're my obsession
Baby, you're my obsession

[Verse 3: KYLE]
Mmm, okay, excuse me
Jeans tuggin' that waist, it's like a koozie
Tell me why I play this game and keep losing
They don't even act this boujee in the movies, yeah
But I get it, get it, yeah
I guess I'm a critic when you're starring
Don't get me started, baby, I'm all in
Even got a picture of you hanging in my office
Yes, girl, I'm a fan of your Instagram
So give me a chance and maybe unblock me now

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Oh, twenty-five, twenty-five seven and
I give you all my attention
Baby, you're my obsession
Oh, twenty-five, twenty-five seven and
I give you love and affection
Baby, you're my obsession
Baby, you're my obsession
Baby, you're my obsession
Obsession

[Outro: Jon Bellion]
Oh, twenty-five, twenty-five seven and
Oh, twenty-five, twenty-five seven
And gotta know, gotta know, know, know, know
Baby, you're my obsession
Baby, you're my obsession
Baby, you're my obsession
Baby, you're my obsession
Baby, you're my obsession
