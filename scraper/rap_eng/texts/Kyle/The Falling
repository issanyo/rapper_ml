[Intro: KYLE, Johnny Juliano]
Yeah
Johnny Juliano!
The falling
Dot Com!
Yeah

[Verse 1: Kyle]
Shades on
Wondering where's the sun gone
In this game, I'm wondering where the fun's gone
One hundred bills, I'm wondering where my one's gone
I spent my young life trying to make that one song
This is it, no it ain't, maybe so
Will it work, I don't know
I just do it 'til I can't do it
C-can't do it no more
And that might take a million years
I feel no man but I got more than a million fears
But I'm gonna keep 'em caged in for tonight
You know we going hard like a dog in a fight, right
I just might, have to pack up my things overnight
Catch that plane and take flight
Gas powered flow
I'm always spitting flames tryna heat up my career
But my one and only fear is fame won't ignite
Let's get this shit right
And make it all happen by tonight
'Cuz dude it's about tonight

[Chorus: Kyle]
By tonight
I'm so high in the sky feeling right
But I'm falling
I'm crashing
From this height there's no way I'll survive
The fall

[Verse 2: Kyle]
So I gave my life to my dream
So I could live the life that I live when I'm asleep
Fast cars and more than enough to eat
And killing beats every couple of weeks
Sounds good to me
But I don't know how my team feelin'
We on the floor we all reaching for the same ceiling
And they be trippin' about these silly road hoes
When they know they got the same cake and the same filling
But I don't eat sweets anyways
I'm too focused on a finished race
Forever change
These are the emotions of a background guy
Who's been moved to center stage
And I'ma stay here
I get what I want
I ain't gotta complain here
Like I got a place here
And I hear that stage calling
I'm too high up
But I'm falling

[Chorus: Kyle]
By tonight
I'm so high in the sky feeling right
But I'm falling
I'm crashing
From this height there's no way I'll survive
The fall

[Verse 3: Kyle]
Yeah
And the fall is looking neverending
Dreaming of all that money that I'm never spending
Every dollar I make, I give away two
To hands, that love to take but can never lend it
But that's that million dollar test
How much can you give before you have nothing left
I give it all
And then I give the rest
Tell a story in a breath
Walk a mile in a step
Checkmate, don't step late, on me
Because I'm about to drop more bombs than the army
This never ending story
Trying to reach these goals
At each one of my shows with the fans still supporting
Yeah
And that crowd still applauding
All of you haters and fakers who never really called me
Well y'all can quit calling
I'm here to announce
That I'm falling

[Chorus: Kyle]
By tonight
I'm so high in the sky feeling right
But I'm falling
I'm crashing
From this height there's no way I'll survive
The fall
