[Intro]
Hey KYLE!

[Verse 1]
Hey, yo, you're KYLE
Heard you brought nice niggas back in style
Funny how your teeth are all fucked on fleek
And you're still going to teach the whole world to Smyle (Right?)
I mean it's pretty much the plan
Flavor that you niggas bring, pretty fucking bland
I be hopping on these tracks like I'm pretty much the man
And I probably feel the way cause I pretty much am, damn
Being anything but lazy
Making these crowds go fucking crazy
Practice backflips on these stages
Give everybody in the front row rabies (Real)
"Kyle, yeah that's my baby"
Everyday feels like I fucking made it
Young King Wavy from California
Women look 23 when they 80 (Ew)
Let's move in a castle
You stop dating these assholes
And we can start off everyday with Sex and Super Smash Bros
And, if you're down, and well yo, I'm down, we can kick it
Don't be weird
You're acting weird
You're making this weird, here girl, just listen

[Chorus]
Shawty swing my way
Memories on the beach sound good to me
So swing my way
Shawty swing my way
If you want it, you got it
Baby, come on
Come on, come on, come on
If you want it, you got it
Baby, come on
Come on, come on

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yo
And I know K.I.D still go hard
Superduper is like still my squad
Running through shit
In the motherfucking whip
Like it's Mario Kart
And I just got a star (Woohoo)
Damn, man, that's real cool
I knew I wasn't gonna really need school
She like me, nigga not you
You're some guy and I'm that dude, dude
Niggas didn't think it was true
They thought my wishes would never come true
They thought I'd end up like all of my friends
Selling narcotics to pay for my food
Haha nah, sorry, no
I don't need dope to feel like gold
So lets be high, and they'll be low
And we'll be good babe, the sun is up, yeah

[Chorus]
Shawty swing my way
Memories on the beach sound good to me
So swing my way
Shawty swing my way
If you want it, you got it
Baby, come on
Come on, come on, come on
If you want it, you got it
Baby, come on
Come on, come on

[Outro]
I'll be there when the sun's up
We'll make love as it comes up
Watch it out on the white waves
Life's an endless summer
We'll all be there when the sun's up
We'll all watch as it comes up
Watch it out on the white waves
Life's an endless summer
I'll be there when the sun's up
We'll make love as it comes up
Watch it out on the white waves
Life's an endless summer
We'll all be there when the sun's up
We'll all watch as it comes up
Watch it out on the white waves
Life's an endless summer
I'll be there when the sun's up
We'll make love as it comes up
Watch it out on the white waves
Life's an endless summer
We'll all be there when the sun's up
We'll all watch as it comes up
Watch it out on the white waves
Life's an endless summer
