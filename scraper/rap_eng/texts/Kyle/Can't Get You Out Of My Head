[Intro]
Johnny Juliano, dot

[Chorus]
Every night, every night, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Got my mind racing, can't get you out of my head
Every night, every night, I'm waiting patient
Fantasizing of havin' you layin' in my bed

[Post-Chorus]
I do when I do when I do
I do when I do when I do
I do when I do when I do
I do when I do when I do

[Verse 1]
Every night, it's every night
It's every time I close my eyes
All I see is you, you, you, déjà-vu, vu
I've been here, waiting for days
Been too long since I've seen your face
Wish I knew how long it would take
With these dreams I'm havin' it's startin' to feel fake
It's right, I just can't get you out of my head
Can't get you
Don't want to
But I know I should
Wouldn't leave even if I could
But without you there I go nowhere
Like you're the engine but need my hood

[Verse 2]
Every day, it's every day
All I do is see your face
Every time I close my eyes
The same movie is on replay
Tell me what I'm really to do
When everything reminds me of you
It's not like I have a choice
Your memories, some I can't lose
It's right, I just can't get you out of my brain
I can't erase
All these days
Wish I could just go back in time
VCR, just rewind
You're never be let behind
'Cause you're with me in my mind

[Chorus]
Every night, every night, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Got my mind racing, can't get you out of my head
Every night, every night, I'm waiting patient
Fantasizing of havin' you layin' in my bed

[Post-Chorus]
I do when I do when I do
I do when I do when I do
I do when I do when I do
I do when I do when I do

[Verse 3]
Every week, it's every week
It's every time I go to sleep
Everytime I start to dream
Guess who it is there I see
You, you, it's always you
You're never old, you're always new
And every time I think it's real
For some reason it's never true
It's right, I just can't get you out of my dreams
You're so real
But I can't deal
You touch my face
My heart feels like an empty space
And you got the other half
And it needs to be replaced

[Verse 4]
Every month, it's every month
It's every time we start to love
Everything is going great
And someone has to mess it up
But I swear I never give up
A little bit is never enough
I need you for my whole life
Without you my heart went bust
It's right, I just can't get you out of my plans
Yeah, the only one
Let's go, makes me heaven
'Cause I know you care
Being without you is still not fair
Every night I feel asleep
Hoping that I wake up and you'll be there

[Chorus]
Every night, every night, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Got my mind racing, can't get you out of my head
Every night, every night, I'm waiting patient
Fantasizing of havin' you layin' in my bed

[Post-Chorus]
I do when I do when I do
I do when I do when I do
I do when I do when I do
I do when I do when I do
