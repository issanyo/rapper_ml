[Chorus]
You are the only girl that when I look into your face
It's like a trip to outer space
The way you take my breath away
And make me feel like I can fly
I'm hypnotized with the things you say
The things you say
You say, you say, you say
The things you say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say

[Verse 1]
Well hey girl, it's so insane girl
I'm so in love with all of the things you say girl
But hey girl I know this is like sorta like crazy
But if I could, and you could, then we could, like maybe
Surpass expectations and give a demonstration
Of a committed relation to our loveless generation
And if you do, you can be mine
And if you don't it's totally fine, I'll just accept that I'm a dweeb
Proceed to go home in my room and cry
I'll close the door and I'll ignore the fact you're into other guys
And I'll wash away the pain with a million tears I cry
But if you do (nah), oh baby if you do
I would like to give my entire life to you

[Chorus]
You are the only girl that when I look into your face
It's like a trip to outer space
The way you take my breath away
And make me feel like I can fly
I'm hypnotized with the things you say
The things you say
You say, you say, you say
The things you say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say

[Verse 2]
Hey, wait, hold on, wait
Okay, let me fucking say what I have to fucking say
See I think that you're great, and a gift given from God
Now I believe that God is love and my love is what you are
And you know that it's true, and as pretty as you are
Focusin' on every flaw, every wrinkle, every scar
And everything that you aren't
And the prettiest thing of all is that your nose is not fake
And your boobs are no facade
Baby, you truly are just everything that you are
And that's perfect
Because a silicon soul and a polyester heart
Makes the light inside kinda dark, yeah

[Chorus]
You are the only girl that when I look into your face
It's like a trip to outer space
The way you take my breath away
And make me feel like I can fly
I'm hypnotized with the things you say
The things you say
You say, you say, you say
The things you say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
