[Verse 1]
Been tryna ignore it lately
Sometimes life can drive me crazy
I stay with my vision hazy
Please don’t ask me why
I trip up over nothing
Always down about something
Worried about all the wrong things I can’t justify

[Pre-Hook]
Why don’t we roll up another?
I got a lot on my mind
Tonight get high and discover
That’s why you gotta...

[Hook]
Puff puff pass
Relax a little bit
Take a breath and exhale
Just puff puff pass, cause once you get a hit
You won’t really care about
Whether you’re rich or if you’re broke
Watch your worries go up in smoke and just Puff puff pass
Relax a little bit
Take a breath and exhale

[Post-Hook]
Puff puff pass
Take a breath, t-take a breath Puff puff pass
Take a breath, t-take a breath

[Verse 2]
I wanna get a bit crossfaded don’t know what the vibe is later
But I brought the rolling papers
If you want to get high
I’m over stressing out
So don’t wait the time is now
You gotta get up to get down so if that’s what you like

[Pre-Hook]
Why don’t we roll up another? I got a lot on my mind
Tonight get high and discover
That’s why you gotta...

[Hook]
Puff puff pass relax a little bit
Take a breath and exhale
Just puff puff pass, cause once you get a hit
You won’t really care about
Whether you’re rich or if you’re broke
Watch your worries go up in smoke and just
Puff puff pass relax a little bit take a breath and exhale

[Post-Hook]
Puff puff pass
Take a breath, t-take a breath Puff puff pass
Take a breath, t-take a breath

[Kyle Verse]
Where you at?
I need you baby
This week has been pretty crazy
Turnt up is an understatement
Yeah, it’s like that
Drunk in every party, looking around like “Where my wife at?” On the couch, watching Wild ‘N Out like “Where my life at?”
I been in a pretty dark place, where’s the light at?
Hennessy and green seem to be the only life hack
You can hit the Taco Bell drive-thru if you drunk
And having a deep talk with Mom high, sucks
But mix those with a party and some shorties
It’s like a bowl of Golden Crisp
I just can’t get enough
So you, Puff puff pass
Not puff puff, puff puff and then pass
You’re the only girl I know who seems to really get that
I’m headed to this kickback, just come with me and sit back and...

[Hook]
Puff puff pass relax a little bit
Take a breath (take a deep breath) and exhale Just puff puff pass, cause once you get a hit You won’t really care about
Whether you’re rich or if you’re broke
Watch your worries go up in smoke and just Puff puff pass relax a little bit
Take a breath and exhale

[Post-Hook]
Puff puff pass
Take a breath, t-take a breath Puff puff pass
Take a breath, t-take a breath
