[Intro: KYLE]
Mhm-mhm
Yup, yup
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Rita Ora, KYLE]
I still keep thinking that you
Would tell me the truth
But you never do
No, you don't (No, no)
Sugar-coated mirrors and lies
The perfect disguise
Do you pay the price?
No, you don't (No, no)

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I wish I could go (Wish I could go)
Back to the start
And tell myself that I hold the cards (The card)
I don't know (Woo)

[Chorus]
Why do I follow
When you lead me nowhere?
You take the dark road
And baby, I go there
There's a part of me
Somewhere deep
Down that still believes
That's why I follow
When you lead me nowhere

[Verse 2]
You let my love go to waste
You're not gonna change
You're not gonna change
No, you won't (Nah)
Staying up at night and I pray it gets better
Waiting on a change in the weather
But I ain't gonna wait here forever
No, I won't

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I wish I could go (Wish I could go)
Back to the start
And tell myself that I hold the cards
I don't know

[Chorus]
Why do I follow
When you lead me nowhere?
You take the dark road
And baby, I go there
There's a part of me
Somewhere deep
Down that still believes
That's why I follow
When you lead me nowhere

[Verse 3: KYLE]
Oh my, I just missed my line
Help me, I'm so blind
I just love your lies
How can you blame me?
You make 'em sound so amazing
Deep down I know that you hate me
Baby, it's so entertaining

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I wish I could go (Wish I could go)
Back to the start
And tell myself that I hold the cards
I don't know
I wish I could say
All of the things I wanna say
And then walk away
I don't know

[Chorus]
Why do I follow
When you lead me nowhere?
You take the dark road
And baby, I go there
There's a part of me
Somewhere deep
Down I still believe
That's why I follow
When you lead me nowhere
