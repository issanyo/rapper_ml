[Intro]
You have reached the voicemail box of 805-018-5561

[Verse 1]
I've just seen your ass last week, but you weren't there
It was a picture you sent somebody baby
Why should I care?
Cuz you told me you ain't gon' be back
You said you fed up with my ass
And when I told you I don't care
I didn't mean that shit like that
Left the voicemail on your phone
And when you hear that shit hit me back
There was a question I had to ask

[Hook]
I thought we were niggas
I guess I'm wrong
I thought we were niggas girl
That's all gone
I thought we were niggas
I guess I'm wrong
I thought we were niggas girl
That's all gone

[Interlude]
Kyle: Hey let me see where this guy's at man
Zini: Yo
Kyle: Hey, hey Zini, what's up man?
Zini: What's good?
Kyle: Hey look, about that ten dollars bro, I, I..
Zini: You talkin' to a voicemail ha ha ha got that ass!
Kyle: Son of a bitch
Zini: This Zini phone call me back
Kyle: Fuck

[Verse 2]
I Just saw your ass last week
And we were both cool
Sold me a nickel and charged me fifteen dollas
That scale wasn't true
And you text my girl behind my back
Even sold me that skimpy sack
Thirty bucks ain't worth the gram
I barley smoke and I know that
I left a voicemail on your phone
Bro imma need about ten bucks back
There was a question I had to ask

[Hook]
I thought we were niggas
I guess I'm wrong
I thought we were niggas dawg
That's all gone
I thought we were niggas
I guess I'm wrong
I thought we were niggas dawg
That's all gone, that's all gone, that's all gone
That's all gone, that's all gone, that's all gone
That's all gone, that's all gone, that's all gone
