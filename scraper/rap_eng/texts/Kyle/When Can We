[Hook]
When can we fall in love again?
When can we maybe be friends?
When can we fall in love again?
When can we? When can we?

[Verse 1]
She's so into getting faded, she's so into getting drunk
She's so into money, diamonds, and all the things that she wants
She's so into getting wasted, she's so into getting high
She's so into every weekend, and hanging with random guys
She's so into shopping splurges and hanging out at the mall
She's so into saying fuck it, and taking her parents car
She's so into college parties, she's so into hanging out
She's so into being into, but that's what life's all about

[Hook]
When can we fall in love again?
When can we maybe be friends?
When can we fall in love again?
When can we? When can we?

[Verse 2]
She's so into being social, she's so into ditching class
She's so into wearing spandex that show off her perfect ass
She's so into flunking high school, she's so into giving up
She's so into letting the world know she doesn't give a fuck

[Bridge]
She's so easy to believe
And nine out of ten she'll leave you for her friends
Yeah, one day you'll understand me for all that I am
And I'll make you you again

[Hook x2]
When can we fall in love again?
When can we maybe be friends?
When can we fall in love again?
When can we? When can we?

When can we love again?
When can we love again?
When can we love again?
When can we love again?
When can we love again?
When can we love again?
When can we love again?
When can we love again?
When can we love again?

[Hook]
When can we fall in love again?
When can we maybe be friends?
When can we fall in love again?
When can we? When can we?

[Bridge]
She's so easy to believe
And nine out of ten she'll leave you for her friends
Yeah, one day you'll understand me for all that I am
And I'll make you you again
