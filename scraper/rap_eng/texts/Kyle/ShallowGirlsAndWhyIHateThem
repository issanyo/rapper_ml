It's 1 A.M
I'm leaving soon
But i'm looking at you
Thinking should I wait till 2
Cause if I stayed
Will you stay too
We can live tonight
Until its through
Cause were in no rush
Baby
No rush, baby
Because
I don't really have a ride home so um...

I don't care about Gucci
Or big checks
I want a nice face
With nice hips
Some girls think that they can buy
True beauty
But just cause your clothes are designer, doesn't mean you're not ugly
So you can tell all those low life bums that believe in chasing anything Jordans feet
That ya'll gonna end up alone

Be my babe please girl do
All I need, its all in you
It's all in you
It's all in you
All i need
It's all in you

I can tell that your different
Your heads got a brain in it
And your mind isn't shallow like some of these girls i know - ohhhh
Yeah, you're all bums
Some of ya'll are pretty but man, most of ya'll are dumb and
Most of ya'll are fat so don't try to think you're cool
Posting lil pics of you swimming at the pool
With some niggas you just met from like where the fuck ever
That's why that nigga's weenie probably looks like a tremor
You remember like- the fuckin- the worm monster thing from that 1990's movie
Okay, so basically, All you shallow ass girls are getting on my fucking nerves and I- Oh my god I fucking hate ya'll and I swear to god-

Be my babe please girl do
You're all I need, its all in you
It's all in you
It's all in you
All i need
It's all in you

I can tell that your different
Your heads got a brain in it
And your mind isn't shallow like some of these girls i know

I can tell that your different
Your heads got a brain in it
And your mind isn't shallow like some of these girls i know

Ohhhhh
Shallow ohhh {x7}
