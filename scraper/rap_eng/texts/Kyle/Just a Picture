[Intro: Kyle]
Mhm, oh yeah, gratata
This is a real ass problem and it should be taken seriously, ok?

[Verse 1: Kyle]
So uhm ay, listen bae
Since you’ve been dating your phone all day
Why don’t you come back down to Earth
You spend too much time in cyberspace
Ok, ok, ok this shit’s lame
FaceTime's the only way I get laid
So get off your phone or leave me alone
Yeah, that would be great

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
Baby, do me just one thing
Put that phone down and look at me
I wanna love you but you’d rather tweet
I wanna love you but you’d rather love that screen
Never have I been so green
But how can I be jealous of this scene
I got a man who would never leave
But when he's here, no, he's not with me

[Bridge: Kyle]
Baby girl, you’re bigger than the Instagram
You know that I’m your biggest fan
You're so something to show the pictures can't

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know it's so much bigger babe
Just a picture baby
Just a picture baby
You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know it's so much bigger babe
Just a picture baby
Just a picture baby
You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know its so much bigger babe
Just a picture baby
Just a picture baby
You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know its so much bigger babe
Just a picture baby
Just a picture baby

[Verse 2: Kyle]
So, uhm, I feel like I can see your soul
When I’m with you I feel like I’m 3 years old you know
But the moment you grabbed your phone
It's like I start knocking and no one's home
It's like I start calling and no one's there
I guess if it ain't got likes no one cares
Don’t follow me, walk with me (Damn)
Don’t tweet to me, talk to me (Yeah)
Retweets that don’t mean shit, they say they heart you but not like this
Yeah, you got favorites you ain't they favorite
Oh my bad, did you forget?
All those people on your Facebook page, are not your only friends
I wanna dive into your heart baby, not slide in your dms

[Bridge: Kyle]
Baby girl, you’re bigger than the Instagram
You know that I’m your biggest fan
You're so something to show the pictures can't

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know it's so much bigger babe
Just a picture baby
Just a picture baby
You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know it's so much bigger babe
Just a picture baby
Just a picture baby
You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know its so much bigger babe
Just a picture baby
Just a picture baby
You look for likes when you could have love
You look for fans but you could have us
You know its so much bigger babe
Just a picture baby
Just a picture baby
