[Verse]
Still tippin, your boy big pimpin
DT wit some bad ass bitches
They gon need stitches, never burn bridges
And you ready know how we get it
I had this Bad chic from the MI, we courted very late
She said she love my city and she said from the state
So i spent some money on her and i let her see my town
Then I took her dinner and she never let me pay
I got T.O. wit me, my whole team busy
Like bees, we just tryna get buzz in my city
You know your boy pop got legendary flow
And he rep the east side, i ain't talking Mario
Man she love me cause she heard that I'm baller
I think honestly, i don't even really want her
Shorty want me and I know she want D
If she call me right now i'll just text her in the morning
Cause i don't really need that, Doecci where beat at
If you want beef nigga, you know where i be at
I'll just grab the cleaver, then we can chop it up
And i know that you ain't about that so den nigga what the fa
This one for Bad little shorty wit the caramel skin
I promise when i see you i see I'mma give you this tip
Now shout out my whole crew, man your boy go lock it down
And I put that on my jays shit i do it for my town
Wassup
