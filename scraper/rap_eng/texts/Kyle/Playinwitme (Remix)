[Chorus: KYLE]
Girl, why are you playin' wit' me?
Girl, who are you playin' wit'?
You been on that new stuff
I been on the same shit
Girl, why are you playin' wit' me?
I don't got the time for that
Might need me a refund, haha
I'ma need that time back

[Verse 1: KYLE]
You say you'll try
I've heard that line a thousand times before
I'm not sad, I'm not cryin'
If you mad, that's fine, but I think that I should go
Yeah, why you tryna play me?
You bein' a different you and I'm bein' the same me
You coulda had Gucci, but now that's Old Navy
And your homegirl wanna date me, she shady, baby

[Chorus: KYLE]
Girl, why are you playin' wit' me?
Girl, who are you playin' wit'? (yeah, yeah)
You been on that new stuff
I been on the same shit
Girl, why are you playin' wit' me? (with me, with me)
I don't got no time for that
Might need me a refund, yeah
I'ma need that time back

[Verse 2: Logic]
Yeah, oh, why is you playin' wit' me, act like you don't want it
But by midnight you be stayin' wit' me, layin' with' me
She playin' games, but I got the cheat codes
And with a girl who fine like mine, I find it hard to need those
Partyin' with my homies, I call them the Casa Migos
Livin' good, livin' real good
This right here, right here, yeah, this that feel good
If I had to do it all over again, I still would
'Cause all you do is play, but it's still good
She love to have fun, yeah, she do it for the thrill
And oh, no, she ain't kiddin' like that shawty on the pill
All I know is all I know and what I know right now
Is you're the only thing I'm tryna play right now

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Girl, why are you playin' wit' me?
Girl, who are you playin' wit'?
You been on that new stuff
And I been on that same shit
Girl, why are you playin' wit' me?
I ain't got no time for that
Might need me a refund
'Cause I'ma need that time back

[Post-Chorus: KYLE]
Girl, why are you playin' wit' me?
Girl, who are you playin' wit'?
Girl, why are you playin' wit' me?
Girl, who are you playin' wit'?

[Verse 3: Kehlani]
Damn, why are you playin' wit' me?
You don't even like girls, ha
So I need you to tell me, baby
What you want, just like the Spice Girls
It's confusin' 'cause you're flirty
But you ain't gon' be the one to say you ever did me dirty
I got pride for that, pay no mind to that
But believe me, if it's fire, I'll make time for that
I'll be faithful, Johnny Cash, walk the line for that
Otherwise, I'll just be single and I'm fine with that

[Chorus: Kehlani, KYLE, Kehlani & KYLE]
Girl, why are you playin' wit' me?
Girl, who are you playin' wit'?
You been on that new stuff
And I been on the same shit
Girl, why are you playin' wit' me?
I don't got no time for that
Might need me a refund (refund)
I'ma need that time back, yeah

[Outro: KYLE]
