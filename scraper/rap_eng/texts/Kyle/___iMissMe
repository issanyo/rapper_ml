[Verse 1: KYLE]
Let's just split the cost
And say it's both our fault
I tried to find my point
And somewhere I got lost
Looking for myself, I found someone I'm not
Or someone I once was, someone I forgot (haha)
Yeah, but everybody needs somebody sometime
And a little me time in the meantime
I'm just tryna be free in my free time (free in my free time)
Haha, yeah, yeah
I really hope you can see where I come from (come from)
And maybe you can come through when it come time (come time)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, it's all alright

[Pre-Chorus: KYLE]
Yeah, I been diving, tryna find you
I'm done hiding from the truth, yeah
Yeah, diving to who's inside me
Someone I'm zoned for, trust me I miss you too

[Chorus: KYLE]
But I miss me (ye-ye-ye-yeah)
I miss me (ye-ye-ye-yeah)
I miss me, girl (oh, oh)
I miss me (ye-ye-ye-yeah)
I miss me (ye-ye-ye-yeah)
I miss me, girl

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Though we still got love, what's love without trust?
I've been by your side, but I guess I gave you too much (way too much)
Friends say I've been low, hate that they playing you up
I gotta move on, I know what you on
We been on a different wave, so I gotta give you your space
Lately I been reading other signs, and we been on a different page
Before we say goodbye, know that I tried for you
Oh, I tried for you

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
I've been tryna find him
I'm done hiding from the truth
Lovin' still who's inside me
Someone I long for, trust me I miss you too

[Chorus: KYLE & Khalid & Khalid]
But I miss me (ye-ye-ye-yeah)
I miss me (ye-ye-ye-yeah)
I miss me, girl (Oh, oh, need a little bit more me, need a little bit more)
I miss me (ye-ye-ye-yeah)
I miss me (ye-ye-ye-yeah)
I miss me, girl

[Bridge]
I miss me
I miss me
I miss me
I miss me
I miss me
I miss me

[Chorus: KYLE & Khalid]
But I miss me (Oh, I been missin' me)
I miss me (Oh, oh)
I miss me, girl (I miss me, I miss me)
I miss me (ye-ye-ye-yeah)
I miss me (ye-ye-ye-yeah)
I miss me, girl (Oh, oh, oh)
