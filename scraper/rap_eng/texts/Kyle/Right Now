**FROM SNIPPET**

[Chorus]
You just mad as hell because you broke (whoo)
Hit the gas, let's see where things gon' go (go)
If you ain't got my bread then you be toast
You know I need my percentage
Right now, ayy, right now, ayy
Right now, ayy, right now, ayy
Right now, ayy, right now, ayy
Right now, right now
Yeah

[Verse]
You just mad as hell because you lame, woah
If I was you I know I'd feel the same, woah
Grown up business, I'm a CEO, oh
But believe on Xbox I go broke, woah
Your girl hot I think she wanna chill, for real
I'm taking, she keep buggin', what's the deal, yeah
No this isn't Fortnite we can't build, yeah
Every rich nigga know how I feel, yeah
K.i.D I always I keep it real, real
K.i.D I always keep it real, yeah

[Chorus]
You just mad as hell because you broke (whoo)
Hit the gas, let's see where things gon' go (go)
If you ain't got my bread then you be toast
You know I need my percentage
Right now, ayy, right now, ayy
Right now, ayy, right now, ayy
Right now, ayy, right now, ayy
Right now, right now
Yeah
