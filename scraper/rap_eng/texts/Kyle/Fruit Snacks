(Hey Kyle!)

[Verse 1: Kyle]
Yo shit
You and yo you and yo shit
You and yo girl, come fuck with me and my clique
No one can fuck with my steez
Have your bitch all on my dick
Chill with my dudes
All of my niggas ain’t cute
But all of my niggas is rich
Really? Yeah!
Me and my team is the realest
And we never learn the word quit

[Chorus]
Yo, yo
Fruit snacks & cups of patron
Don't really smoke
Bitches be sniffin' that snow
Girlies in reindeer gear
Dancing for silver & gold (sliver & gold)
Yo, yo
Fruit snacks & cups of patron
Don't really smoke
Bitches be sniffin' that snow
Girlies in reindeer gear
Dancing for silver & gold (sliver & gold)

[Verse 2: Kyle]
Aight, Aight
Niggas is not in my sight
No, not in my fuckin zone
Right?
Sorry for comin' off rude
I just want niggas to know
Ya know?, Cool
Niggas be hittin' my phone
Tellin' me they 'bout to blow
SIKE
YIKES
Y'all like them project lights
None of y'all niggas is on
What?, Woah

[Chorus]
Fruit snacks and cups of Patron
Don’t really smoke
Bitches be sniffing that snow
Girlies in reindeer gear
Dancing for silver & gold (sliver & gold)
Yo, yo, Fruit snacks and cups of Patron
Don’t really smoke
Bitches be sniffing that snow
Girlies in reindeer gear
Dancing for silver & gold (sliver & gold)

[Bridge]
Someday, we'll all be encased in silver & gold ohhh (in golddd ohhh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Someday, we'll all be encased in gold ohhh, ohhhh

[Chorus]
Fruit snacks and cups of Patron

Bitches be sniffing that snow
Girlies in reindeer gear
Dancing for silver & gold (sliver & gold)
Yo, yo, Fruit snacks and cups of Patron
Don’t really smoke
Bitches be sniffing that snow
Girlies in reindeer gear
Dancing for silver & gold (sliver & gold)
