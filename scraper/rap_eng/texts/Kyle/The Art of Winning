[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well nobody can tell me nothing when it comes to stress juggling and suffering
Doggie I done been through it all
And all is what I been
And I just turned every single loss to a win
I'm never gonna lose long as I got my P's and my Q's up
K.i.D is somebody there will never be two of
And too much anger the only weakness I have
I get it from my dad but ooh that shit makes me mad
I'd cut my eyes out before I'd see my mom sad
Or see Ian grow up without everything I had
My gramps trained boxers, and ever since three
He's been training me to be the motherfucking champ
They saying K.i.D is the motherfucking man
Like Wile E. Coyote I always have a plan
I've always had a plan to be everything I can
And let everyone know everything I am, yeah

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life on the bottom
Always tryna smile in a room full of problems
Everybody says I got a chance to make it happen
Fuck seeing my house when nobody in it's laughing
I lost my best friend when I lost my fucking gramps
I told him I'd stay good when everything else is bad
I said I wouldn't stop until there's nothing left beating in my chest
Until then expect nothing but the best, yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, and I came fully equipped with
Everything I need to let this motherfucker rip
This is something God gave me
And God is what makes me
Hop up on these stages and give everybody rabies
But still everybody hates me but
Guess who don't give a fuck
K-I-D man, they can't, see me
Anyone who tries to hurt others is a weakling
Oh yeah that's what I said
And you can keep my shit on replay dawg
No I'm never sleeping dawg
Evil isn't either and aside from Justin Bieber
Everyone's tryna be a creeper dawg
Homie I just don't get it
If you're trying to spread evil through the world that's pathetic
I was 6 years old when I decided I'd be famous
Look into these eyes and tell me you see the braveness
'Cuz you see the real
The me, the hatred
You could see my heart begging for you not to break it
Fuck it I lost a father never again will I gain it
And real pain is something you can't fake
If my grandpa was here, he would whisper in my ear
He would tell me how he loved me
And he knew that I would make it
"You're gonna have to step it up Kyle" that's what he'd say
'Cuz when I'm gone you know you're gonna have to find a way
But now I'm lost and in need of a GPS
But I was put here for a reason I can feel it in my chest
Well old gramp Dad is fucking crazy
My aunt is fucking crazy
Chris is going crazy and my mom just had a baby
Millie feels alone and I can't handle the weather
But don't worry gramps I'm keeping us together
'Cuz I'ma go hard 'till I motherfucking die
'Cuz everyone I love seems to never have enough
And I don't get shit when I look up to the sky
Fuck asking why, yeah

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life on the bottom
Always tryna smile in a room full of problems
Everybody says I got a chance to make it happen
Fuck seeing my house when nobody in it's laughing
I lost my best friend when I lost my fucking gramps
I told him I'd stay good when everything else is bad
I said I wouldn't stop until there's nothing left beating in my chest
Until then expect nothing but the best, yeah
