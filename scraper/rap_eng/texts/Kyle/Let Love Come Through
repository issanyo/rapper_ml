[Verse 1: Kyle]
Ok, "<3 lol. What's the dealie?"
That's what I just texted to this girl I love, for-really
She's so into art, and taking walks when it's dark in parks
And dudes who are smart, and drawing hella hearts
It's a lot to think of, she's really a lot to think of
That's such a relief, cause I don't really get to think much
Have you ever been afraid to take a chicks call?
Have you ever tried talking to a brick wall?
Well either way, at least she's not the same, you know?
And I can actually conversate to someone with a brain
Yeah, you know like someone with a name
That I can memorize before I end up getting played
And wake up the next day, possibly engaged
Possibly to stop these thoughts from trying to get away
I'm in a world of dumb girls, and I'm just trying to escape
And she looks like a bike, and she looks like a car...
And you look like a plane
So let me buy the tickets, where ever you wanna kick it
Girl, we could leave today
Yeah, As long as we leave today
And you won't keep..???

[Hook]
Cause that's all we do
We let a little- let a little love come through (love come through)
And that's all we do (and that's all we do)
We let a little- let a little love come through (love come through)

[Verse 2: Yuna]
Sitting down at a cafe
And I'm trying to write a good song in my book
As I flip through the pages
I see a little note I wrote when I was 22
Don't hesitate, you're all you've got
Don't ever let them get to you
And this is what you're all about
You let your little- let your little dreams come true
Yes you do!

[Hook]
