[Verse 1: Kyle]
Well it's pretty much illuminated
Ain't it, you niggas hate it
Why you tryna  act like you don't fuck with King Wavy
Why you tryna  act like you don't think that I'm amazing
Super Duper Kyle but I never do the saving
Curly haired girls go ahead go crazy
Had AP English so the flow is never basic
Every time you see my face, just know you niggas have to face it (That sucks)
Please tell your girlfriends and cameras to back up
I make hits to back to back to back up
Super Duper Kyle is really good rapper
Shoot like the nigga name Kyle on the Raptors
Rappers worst nightmare ever since Napster
You ain't really gonna hit it if you gotta ask em'
That's why I don't need to ask em'
Cuz I already know the answer

[Pre-Hook: Kyle]
It's lit, It's lit
It's it's it's lit
It's lit, it's lit
It's lit

[Hook: Kyle]
Ooh if she want it she can get it
She already know it's lit
Ooh if you want it come get it
Ooh it's lit
Ooh if she want it she can get it
She already know it's lit
Ooh if you want it come get it
Ooh it's lit

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
Never basic bitches, I just hit bad ones
Did this ever since I pushed the green Saturn
Linked up with Kyle, it's lit just like Bic
Watch how this game get flipped like sidekicks
In the brand new 'Preme, Bape, did hopping out a spaceship
Shawty got a tab on her, I'ma watch her take trips
Hit her with a light, damn
Eight o' clock tab that's a night cab
And I got her rolling off the molly
All about the money
I was off the henny in Ohio, I lost my Versace
Shawty straight from Trini & Tobago
She should have a halo, she my angel, Filipino fuego
Out in San Diego making payroll, every day though
She can't say no, pass her like a hot potato
I just play though, cause I lay low
I'ma take her to the bay though
Hey, I might take her to San Fran
'Cause a young nigga that based

[Pre-Hook: Kyle]
It's lit, It's lit
It's it's it's lit
It's lit, it's lit
It's lit

[Hook: Kyle]
Ooh if she want it she can get it
She already know it's lit
Ooh if you want it come get it
Ooh it's lit
Ooh if she want it she can get it
She already know it's lit
Ooh if you want it come get it
Ooh it's lit

[Bridge: Kyle]
Cups half empty, lights dim down
This shit don't shine the same since you dipped out
I'm pretty faded now, it's all pretty faded now
Baby I need the light, and you're the only star around
See ya light it up, light it up, light it up, oh yeah
Baby light it up, light it up, light it up, oh yeah
Baby light it up, light it up, light it up, oh yeah
We gon' light it up, light it up, light it up, yeah

[Hook: Kyle]
Ooh if she want it she can get it
She already know it's lit
Ooh if you want it come get it
Ooh it's lit
Ooh if she want it she can get it
She already know it's lit
Ooh if you want it come get it
Ooh it's lit

[Outro: Kyle]
Cups half empty, lights dim down
This shit don't shine the same since you dipped out
I'm pretty faded now, it's all pretty faded now
Baby I need the light, and you're the only star around
See ya light it up, light it up, light it up, oh yeah
Baby light it up, light it up, light it up, oh yeah
