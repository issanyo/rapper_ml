[Verse 1: KYLE]
You the one
Ain't no one can do me like
Love like the one in the movies, I
Know niggas might want too, you bad
You know I'm the one gon' do you right
Spend the next few seasons overseas
Checking our pay, tryna see what're we on
In the sheets tryna make you sing, put a beat on
We go upstairs make a real love theme song
I met you back in school
Downplay shit, tryna keep things cool
Remember me saying I'm finna make you mine
Never woulda thought that shit would be true
But eight years later, babe, here we are
Loving you since we had VCR's
I'ma loop this beat for a million bars
Sing about you, baby, it ain't hard

[Pre-Chorus: Nylo]
I'll take a lifetime with you
From now until the end
Say it one more time then
Do it all again
We turn sparks into fire
Set flame unto the world
These scars are loose so we're never getting bored

[Chorus: Nylo]
I keep on, I keep on
I keep on loving you
I keep on, I keep on
I keep on loving you

[Verse 2: Nylo]
All I can see for miles
Is the future looking better every night
All of the seasons of life
Play their roles inside the movie that we write
The temperature's heating up
Our energy's eating up and everyone wants a little time
But babe, you should know
The deeper we go
There's no mountain we couldn't climb

[Pre-Chorus: Nylo]
I'll take a lifetime with you
From now until the end
Say it one more time then
Do it all again
We turn sparks into fire
Set flame unto the world
These scars are loose so we're never getting bored

[Chorus: Nylo]
I keep on, I keep on
I keep on loving you
I keep on, I keep on
I keep on loving you

[Outro]
I can't be there without you
No one ever got me there without you
We're loose as a feeling
Without you, baby, by my side
Without you, baby, by my side
I keep on, I keep on
I keep on loving you
