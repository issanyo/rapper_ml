[Intro]
SlimzProductionz!

*Scratching*
Hear these melodies!

[Verse: KID]
I done seen the way you came up
Now you doing good stuff
Steady rhyming so that you could get a buck

(Wassup man!)

Not much, tryna kick it if you can
I see shawty walking past
And she holding another man

(Goddamn!)

Oh well I better get to rhyming
So I'm steady shining
And all the chicken hoes be climbing
On my pause

You better know I'm coming straight with flaws
What you rocking designer now you thinking you the boss?

(Nigga please!)

You lucky the kid does It straight with ease
Ain't even have to pay attention when I'm battling these

(You heard!)

Preach the word, while you spitting all these verbs
Making me hear your shit man I kick it to the curb

(Uh)

Only 15 but I'm spitting realist
Seeing big dreams while you mobbing with the killers
I ain't worried about the snitches
Seeing bigger pictures
Picking up these rappers with precision
They still listening...
