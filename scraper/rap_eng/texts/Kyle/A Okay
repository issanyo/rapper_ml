[Verse 1]
Yeah, okay so this is for the white girls who ain't heard me
And for the blogs who label me as nerdy
Tryna keep me down but, yo, don't worry
I got all the answers like my nickname Siri
Steven Hawking test me, ain't no one can best me
I just kill everything, hey someone should arrest me
They try to Kanye West me and I don't care who assess me
Iâ€™ll never let a nigga circle, bubble, dot, or check me
Tell the pretty chick in the dress "Oh ayyee"
Rascal ass niggas on the scene, otay
Niggas don't want it with my clique, no way
If they wanna get hit with that shit, okay

[Hook]
Pretty ass girls in the back, say "Hey!"
Skinny ass niggas playing games, say "Hey!"
They gon' talk talk but it ain't gon' change
SuperDuperKyle stay A-okay
Pretty ass girls in the back, say "Hey!"
Skinny ass niggas playing games, say "Hey!"
They gon' talk talk but it ain't gon' change
SuperDuperKyle stay A-okay

[Verse 2]
So um, so me and my team and shit we're really fucking real right?
Flows so cold, I could make a stove chill right?
My nigga it's the rapper, ill adapter, more like your new favorite actor
McDonald's rappers are making hella slappers
Swaggy ass tee, pullin' out my jeans
Like they ain't dweebs, scream these niggas don't mean nuthin'
They can go to hell if that's really how they feel
Sorry if you think I'm fake, I just keep it real
Ricky-ricky-real, real yeah I do that, I do that
You're a fucking liar, nigga true that, true that
You ain't got no heart, I could see it in your face
And these guys in my lane, get the fuck out my way
They ain't got no say so, savin' up them Pesos
Can't carry their weight, nah ain't tryna be their cane, no
Sick of being doubted, sick of being hated
So I'm just gonna kill it 'til I'm sick of being famous

[Hook]

Phony, people, come a-round
Never, doubt, stand, down
Girls, wow, money, wow

All the way turns that

They can't hate us
I'm A-okay
