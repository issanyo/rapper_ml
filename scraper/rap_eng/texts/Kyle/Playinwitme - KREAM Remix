[Intro: KYLE]
Girl, why are you playin' wit' me?
Girl, who are you playin' wit'?
You been on that new stuff

Girl, why are you playin' wit' me?
I don't got the time for that
Might need me a refund, haha

[Verse 1: KYLE]
You say you'll try
I've heard that line a thousand times before
I'm not sad, I'm not cryin'
If you mad, that's fine, but I think that I should go
Yeah, why you tryna play me?
You bein' a different you and I'm bein' the same me
You coulda had Gucci, but now that's Old Navy
And your homegirl wanna date me, she shady, baby

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Damn, why are you playin' wit' me?
You don't even like girls, ha
So I need you to tell me, baby
What you want, just like the Spice Girls
It's confusin' 'cause you're flirty
But you ain't gon' be the one to say you ever did me dirty
I got pride for that, pay no mind to that
But believe me, if it's fire, I'll make time for that
I'll be faithful, Johnny Cash, walk the line for that
Otherwise, I'll just be single and I'm fine with that

[Chorus: KYLE & Kehlani]

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh (time)
Ooh, ooh

Time, time (I don't)
Time, time (playin')
