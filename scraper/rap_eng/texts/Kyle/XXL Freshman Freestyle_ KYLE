[Verse]
When I think about you, life is not as bad
Gas prices ain't as high, and sad movies are not as sad
I pray to God I never break yo' heart and end up like my dad
I don't think he ever planned to fail, he just failed to plan
So I don't use the calendar, it's not in my genetics though
Nolan Cole's on his iPhone so I don't sweat it yo'
Customized by living a life of never having shit
So I just learned this dance and rapping shit to go get it yo'
Jeezy it was easy to sing like R Kelly on a empty belly
Like Helen Keller ain't nobody could tell me nothing
I knew my shit was slappin', I knew my bass was bumpin'
I used to sound like Drake dude, tell me who fucking doesn't
But I was 13 so fuck it, oh well
I'm 23 and I'm trying to be as cool as Pharrell
Like for real, who's gon' be on top? You never can tell
Got homies on the block that went from Deebo to Ezal
I told them "I'd rather be Craig," make music, make money instead
It's funny how the things keeping me fed, bought me a bed
All came from my head
