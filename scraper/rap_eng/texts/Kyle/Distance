[Verse 1: Juicy J]
More money in my bank account
Show prices going up, no discount
One Academy Award, you can't just rule us out
But I do want your bitch, I could use her mouth
I'm selling CD's out the trunk, they still major
From a shotgun house to a skyscraper
But I'm still hood, Juicy keep one in the chamber
No security, gang banger
Trippy life, Xan in that dirty Sprite
In the brand new Ferrari, running traffic lights
I'm like my homie Big Sean, I do it
Ball hard, got these hoes on my dick droolin'


[Hook x2: Juicy J]
I'm popping bottles by the case
Just to see them haters' faces
I'm throwing up them big faces
Just to see them haters' faces
I keep my Glock in all places
Just to see them haters' faces
Just to see them haters' faces
Just to see them haters' faces


[Bridge: Kyle]
Hater please, keep your distance from me
Keep your distance from me (yeah)


[Hook x4]


[Verse 2: Kyle]
Okay, so fuck what you niggas thought
I got fruit snacks in my cup
I keep hoes all at my shows
And the cutest ones on my cock
I know everyone that you wanna know
And flipped everything that you flopped
Nigga I'm everything that you wanna be
And be everywhere that you not
It's good, misunderstood
I'd hate me too
That's why I go hard
And thank god that I'm not you
Look, basically you're lame to me
Fuck everything that you say to me
I mean, fuck is up?
Like, what the fuck?
If you don't fuck with me
Then stay away from me
Bottles by the cases
Toast to all y'all hatin'
Y'all gave me the motivation
To turn me into a great me
Now niggas wanna be me
And bitches wanna date me
And every time they see my face
I make them haters face it
What's up?


[Hook x4]


[Outro: Kyle]
Hater please, keep your distance from me
Keep your distance from me (yeah)
