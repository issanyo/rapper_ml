[Verse 1]
Since day one I said fuck the fame and everything it dealt
But the fame is really here just to facilitate the wealth
But the wealth attracts you haters like mosquitos to a well
And the waters getting deeper so I must set out to sail
Someone called my cell, and left a voicemail
They said congratulations on the million record sales
As I'm flippin over furniture, knockin' shit off the shelf
I told myself I'd never get too deep to take a breath but I'm sinkin

[Hook]
And it's so hard to breathe, yeah
And even more so to sleep when no one cares
It was all I could need
But now I'm sinking, so deep, I can't come up for air

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I've seen the valley of the shadow of death
I've seen the mountains, a wild childhood
That's why I sing about it
I just try to move on and keep my peace about it
But come to think about it I can't even count the days
That I spent starvin' tryin' to find a some decent housing
It's why I'm always smiling but on this beat I seem so violent
So ask me about the music scene and what the fuck I think about it
Time flies I guess that's why I'm buggin
Just yesterday I was rappin with my brother and my cousin
If you had the stove or toaster on you couldn't use the oven
We knew that we were struggling we just actin like we wasn't
It was either make it rapping, if not that then hustling
So all I see is magazine covers in this game
You either surface or you plummet
It's a thin line and I'm just tryin to keep my head above it, damn

[Hook]
And it's so hard to breathe, yeah
And even more so to sleep when no one cares
It was all I could need
But now I'm sinking, so deep, I can't come up for air

Air I (I sink away)
Air (I sink away)
Air (As I sink away) I (Damn I sink away)
Damn air damn pots and pans
Get carried away damn get carried away it
Was never in the plans
But hey, it's long way from beatin' pots and pans

[Hook]
And it's so hard to breathe, yeah
And even more so to sleep when no one cares
It was all I could need
But now I'm sinking, so deep, I can't come up for air

Damn it was never in the plans
But hey, it's a long way from beatin' pots and pans
But now I'm sinking so deep I can't come up for air, air, ah
