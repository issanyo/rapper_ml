[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
Plot twist, I never thought it would end up like this
I always thought it would only be one kiss
One became a hundred
Oh, all of a sudden, I'm saying, "I love you"
Plot twist, everything's happening so quick
I only wanted a taste of your lips
Lips became your body, nice turned into naughty
You hit me with a plot twist

[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
I might drive fast, but don't slow dance
I fuck all night, I don't really fuck with romance
I might be hands on, but I never hold hands
Since you came into my world
I had to leave that in the past tense

[Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
All my life I've been a player, player, player
But I don't wanna play no more
I guess that's the effect you got on me
Somebody better say a prayer, prayer, prayer
For the one I was before
I guess that's the effect you got on me

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
Plot twist, I never thought it would end up like this
I always thought it would only be one kiss
One became a hundred
Oh, all of a sudden, I'm saying, "I love you"
Plot twist, everything's happening so quick
I only wanted a taste of your lips
Lips became your body, nice turning to naughty
You hit me with a plot twist

[Verse 2: KYLE]
Don't know what it was, don't know what it was
Baby, turn me up, baby, turn me up
It was only one night, I was in and out
How the fuck I fall in love? How I fall in love?
Yeah, she got inside
She built a brand new house in my mind
And damn, she already close with my moms
I couldn't even kick her out if I tried
Oh, I had it figured out
How'd she shoot me down?
Now she's moving in
Ah, shit

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
Plot twist, I never thought it would end up like this
I always thought it would only be one kiss
One became a hundred
Oh, all of a sudden, I'm saying, "I love you"
Plot twist, everything's happening so quick
I only wanted a taste of your lips
Lips became your body, nice turning to naughty
You hit me with a plot twist

[Verse 3: Marc E. Bassy]
See, I've never been in love
But I've never been opposed to it
I never really thought I'd ever get this close to it
Where do we take a chance?
You wanna make a go for it
'Cause now you come into my world
I'll chase you 'round the globe for it

[Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
All my life I've been a player, player, player
But I don't wanna play no more
I guess that's the effect you got on me
Somebody better say a prayer, prayer, prayer
For the one I was before
I guess that's the effect you got on me

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
Plot twist, I never thought it would end up like this
I always thought it would only be one kiss
One became a hundred
Oh, all of a sudden, I'm saying, "I love you"
Plot twist, everything's happening so quick
I only wanted a taste of your lips
Lips became your body, nice turning to naughty
You hit me with a plot twist

[Outro: Marc E. Bassy]
I never thought it would end up like this
I always thought it would only be one kiss
One became a hundred
Oh, all of a sudden, I'm singing, "I love you"
Plot twist, never thought it would end up like this
I only wanted a taste of your lips
Lips became your body, nice turning to naughty
You hit me with a plot twist
