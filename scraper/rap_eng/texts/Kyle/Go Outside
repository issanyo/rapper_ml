[Intro]
I really want to go outside
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Wake up, it's a Sunday, and I can see the sun rays, it's okay
It's a beautiful day
The sun is shining bright it's so exciting
A good day
It's okay, yeah
And people need to notice
That machines can make us old
And the earth is where the soul is
And outside's where we belong

[Chorus]
Cuz baby when life indoors won't let you breathe
We can go outside
Outside where we'll be free
Yeah, wanna go outside
C'mon let's go outside, yeah
Let's go outside, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's go outside
Wanna go outside, yeah
Let's go outside, yeah, yeah
Outside
