[Verse 1]
Well hey, hey baby I think you're super cute
And you're hard to figure out like a Rubix cube...
And you're super cool! like a fridge or sumthing...
See i just wanna keep it all and get rid of nuthin
And if you talk to me, shit I'll say sumthing funny!
That shit will make ya smile
It will make ya wanna drop those new pants you just bought to the ground
And let me pick you up later just to take yo ass DOWN
Sorry honey that wasn't funny
I need to practice
Maybe I could use you
Maybe I could use you
As someone who laughs at everything I do
And makes me feel like I'm someone too

[Post-Hook]
A lot of the shit I say
Will always be stupid, or, always be lame, but hey
My hands out and I'm just asking you to take it
You don't have to like it, I'm just asking you to fake it, baby

[Verse 2]
I belong with a freaking actress
Even if they are, damn, at least they can act less
Annoyed of this teenage boy with a big nose
Like tucan said follow it wherever it goes
But it only smells you so I guess I'm kinda screwed
Til' I find some nose plugs or sumthing fuckin else
Cause everyday is Christmas and I'm a fuckin elf
Working my ass off trying to make you wanna laugh, ahh
Make myself feel crappy just to make you fuckin happy
And you always wanna fight like that little dog, Scrappy
And I'm scooby doo whatever the fuck you want
But do I get a Scooby Snack? nope, now how rude is that?
How true is the fact that no matter who it is, or even where it's at
JanSport I had your back?
And makes me feel like I'm someone too
