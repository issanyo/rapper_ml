[Hook: 6x]
Let's never rewind babe
Let's never rewind
Do this all the time babe
Do this all the time

[Verse 1:]
K dot I dot D-D-D-D-D-D
Damn
Everyday I live with you
That's when I want to live again
Baby
Yeah, I want to live again
Every night
Partyin'
Just you, me and my friends
BAM
The world it, seems so great
When you're only eighteen
And you party every night
And you're livin' out your dreams
They say the strongest force in the world is called love
Well, I love the way I live
And that's not ever gonna change
Aye
They think they can stop us doing what we want to do
Forget about our dreams
Cause' they're never coming true (what?)
They tell us money's the only thing that keeps us happy
Well, I'm broke with my friends
But I can't stop laughing

[Bridge:]
See society's a lame
And it tries to make us scared
And say we're going down the drain
Because we're so unprepared
I tell em' use their brain
Right from the start
Cause' your brain is gonna die
But you will never lose your heart

[Hook: 6x]
Let's never rewind babe
Let's never rewind
Do this all the time babe
Do this all the time

[Verse 2:]
K dot I dot D-D-D-D-D-D
Damn
Everyday I live with you
That's when I want to live again
Baby
Yeah, I want to live again
Every day
The same ol' thing
The party never ends
See, the world would seem so cool
When like everything you do
Is like always filled with laughs
And experience is new
And everybody's here
And nobody wants to leave
Well, I got my friends and fam
And that's really all I need
Aye
They think they can stop us
Choosing who we want to love
And make us spend our live (our lives?)
Doing everything they want (what?!)
And tell us that without money
Our lives are gonna suck
Well, I've been to a lot of stores
And, um, none of them sell fun

[Bridge:]
See society's a lame
And it tries to make us scared
And say we're going down the drain
Because we're so unprepared
I tell em' use their brain
And think about this part
That your brain is gonna die
But you will never lose your heart

[Hook: 6x]
Let's never rewind babe
Let's never rewind
Do this all the time babe
Do this all the time

[Speech:]
Look life isn't about money. You don't need a good job to be successful cause money isn't success, happiness is. And I'm happy everyday of my life, man

[Outro:]
All the time
Do this all the time
Let's never rewind
