[Intro]
You would like to see something really sexy?
Misour, you don't, uh, you don't sound so sure?
Well what about your mom?
Oh, no no no, she won't come in just, uh
Turn the music up she won't hear us

[Verse 1]
As long as we're here alone tell me your, tell me your secrets
I won't tell a soul I promise to, promise to keep it
And I'll do things you'll tell all of your friends, friends, friends
Friends have to love me girl, it's only pretend (yeah)
Yeah, cause I know, yeah I know how bad
You wanna get it off your chest
Yeah, and I know, yeah I know how bad
You want it to make sense

[Chorus: Kyle & Beldina]
Girl, my mom isn't home again
Locked all the doors and I, turned off the phone again
Turn off the lights I'll do, you in the morn' again
Crawl in my bed and I'll, show you how warm it is, yeah
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Okay, well woah, take a load off
Let me hold your worries baby, help you take your coat off
And if you're thirsty baby you can have a soda
Or some shots, I mean fuck it, why not? You know?
I know you brought the cuffs and all because your dad's a cop
But I'd rather not, cause there'd be no way to make you stop
We can swap, cause you know I'm down to give the tippy top
Okay wait, alright wait, oh okay, there's the spot

[Chorus: Kyle & Beldina]
Girl, my mom isn't home again
Locked all the doors and I, turned off the phone again
Turn off the lights I'll do, you in the morn' again
Crawl in my bed and I'll, show you how warm it is, yeah
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
My mom isn't home again
Locked all the doors and I, turned off the phone again
Turn off the lights I'll do, you in the morn' again
Crawl in my bed and I'll, show you how warm it is, yeah
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
We'll go deep, we'll go deep, deep, deeper
