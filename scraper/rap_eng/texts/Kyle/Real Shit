[Intro: Sophia Black]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Sophia Black]
When you're dancing with someone and you think it's lit
But when the lights turn on and they look like piss
That's some real shit

When you're too fucked up and you're at the club
But then your friend rolls through with another damn shot
That's some real shit

[Chorus]
Sometimes, oh some real shit
Life's a real bitch, mhm
But I'm okay, I'm still happy
I won't quit
That's some real shit

[Verse 2]
When he says he'll call back so you made no plans
But now it's 3 AM 'cause he never called back
That's some real shit

When you say you're too grown for that drama mess
But when it really comes down you're still into it
That's some real shit

[Chorus]
Oh, most times, on some real shit
Life's a real dick, oh yeah
But I'm okay, I'm still happy
I won't quit
'Cause that's that real shit

Oh, when you think you're the shit and act like the shit
But when it comes to shit, you know you really ain't shit
That's that real shit, that's that real shit, that's that real shit
I know, I know, I know, I know, I said

When you think you're the shit and act like the shit
But when it comes to shit, you know you really ain't shit
That's that real shit, that's that real shit, that's that real shit

[Verse 3: Kyle]
I gotta,..uh fuck
This that real shit
So you know when you're out with your chick
And you gotta spend a grip
Because her mind is set on steak and shrimp
But your bank accounts on chicken strips
And she don't give a shit?
Then you gotta buy her movie tix
And you try to lean in for a kiss
And she says 'I'm not in the mood'
And then you say 'hmm'
And she says 'what?’
You know what... nothing, fuck
And the movies weak so you go to sleep
And then you start to have this dream
That your forgot to lock your screen
And now she's going through your texts
So you wake up like Mr Crabs
And she's all like 'Who's Stephanie?'
Um, you mean my cousin? Geez yeah, since 1993
You don't work for TMZ
There's nothing here behind the scene
You're not homies with Scoobie Doo
This is not a mystery
You can check my history
I've only been to Pornhub once
And went to church the morning of
Yes, I know, I sorta suck but I've never been more in love
I just wanna get more in touch
Then she gets a call from Gabby
Her attitude was extra crappy
Now it's hella happy
And you just sitting there like damn what the fuck just happened?
So you call up NASA
And even they don't got the answers
That's that real shit

[Chorus]
Oh, when you think you're the shit and act like the shit
But when it comes to shit, you know you really ain't shit
That's that real shit, that's that real shit, that's that real shit
I know, I know, I know, I know, I said

When you think you're the shit and act like the shit
But when it comes to shit, you know you really ain't shit
That's that real shit, that's that real shit, that's that real shit

That’s that real shit
Yeah
That’s that real shit, oh yeah
Mmm
Real shit you know?
