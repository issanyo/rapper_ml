[Verse 1: Kyle]
See I know your favorite song, yeah I know
I'll sing if you let me
Play it however you want, baby
If it makes you happy
Every last bar
Bad notes and all
This song is all for you
When you're in your car
Put this track on
Tell me you love me too

[Pre-Chorus: Kyle]
For you, for you
For you, for you
This one is all for you
For you, for you
For you, for you
This one is all for you

[Chorus]
This one is all for you
This one is all for you
This one is all for you
This one is all for you
This one is all for you
This one is all for you
This one is all for you
This one is all for you

[Verse 2: Yuna]
This is your favorite song, I know
It sounds like the ocean
It came from inside my heart, baby
When you made it open
Every last note
Stems from the hope
You'll say you love me too
Wherever you go, I want you to know
This one's all for you, for you

[Pre-Chorus: Yuna]
For you, for you
For you, for you
This one is all for you
For you, for you
For you, for you
This one is all for you

[Chorus]
This one is all for you
This one is all for you
This one is all for you
This one is all for you
This one is all for you
This one is all for you
This one is all for you
This one is all for you
This one is all for you
This one is all for you
This one is all for you
