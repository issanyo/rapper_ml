[Verse 1: Kyle]
I ain't been gettin' high...
Well, maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me girl, I don't always reply
Well, you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I notice, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's coming at me, I wonder who throws it
I got tunnel vision and these niggas out of focus
Superduper sniper gang, don't get hit with the scope, kid, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This went hella platinum, nigga it was just a throwaway
My album so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a motherfucking snow day
Aye, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I am in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters
I got a selfie with Oprah, but I still ain't gonna post it
And I'm in my happy place posted, I ain't frown since '06
I ain't cried since '01, they freed Lil Kodak, the kids back let's throw somethin
You can come back to mine though, your friend ain't cute, but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

[Chorus: Kyle]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I...I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

[Refrain: Kyle & Kodak Black]
Oh, I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh, I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh, I... Oooooeeeeeee yeah

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I could spot you from a hundred miles away, aye
I can see you through my Jim Maui shades, aye
When I pull up, I’m in a black Audi A8, aye
Leave your man ‘cause he ain’t nothin’ like me, babe
I’ve been trying to get out my bubble ‘cause I ain’t never wanting to be linking up
I don’t ever wanna be doing features
I stay far away from these people
Said she love me, but I don’t believe her
Yeah I want you, but I don’t need ya
Even when I ain't lookin’, I see ya
You can’t even see me, but I see ya
I’m just chilling, smokin' reefer
Dropping codeine in a liter
I’ve got more stripes than a Zebra
I’m a Gemini, she’s a Libra
Pulling stunts like Evel Knievel
Once I freak her, I’m gonna delete her
I was just talking to Auntie Rita
Told her “stay out here ‘cause we need ya” aye aye
I ain’t stalking, but I see ya over there, yeah
Yeah I’m watching 'cause this Sniper Gang for real, yeah
Hit the Dentist, and I’ll put diamonds in my grill, yeah
Don’t think I'm soft girl, I’m just showing you how I feel
Aye, yeah yeah yeah, booted up on a pill
Aye, yeah yeah yeah, can see ya from over here
Aye, yeah baby girl I can see you in a lift
See you riding in a spliff
I put VV’s on your ear, aye

[Chorus: Kyle]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I... I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

[Refrain: Kyle]
Oh, I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh, I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh, I...
