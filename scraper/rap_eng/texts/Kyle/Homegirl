[Chorus]
Can I get you all alone girl
You're more than just a homegirl
Can I take you home girl (I mean)
Can I get you home girl
Going to your home girl
I want to get you home girl
You're more than just a homegirl
I'm trying to take you home girl

[Verse 1: Dougie F]
Yeah, GPS not working on my phone (Oh no)
Don't know how the fuck a nigga getting home (No no)
I've been out riding on my own (Solo)
I've been thinking about you all alone girl
I've been in my zone (In my zone)
Trying to figure out what's really going on (What's going on)
I mean I can get you home in the morn' (A.M.)
I got a bottle of that Henny and Patron (Amen)
Trying to have a house party me and you girl
We ain't got to tell a soul
It's a private party, really hope it's cool girl
Yeah, and nobody got to know

[Pre-Chorus: Dougie F]
Cause baby I can
Change the plans if you really want to
I can make you leave your man if you really want to
Cause girl it ain't a thing that a nigga won't do
All the niggas saying is I really want you

[Chorus: Dougie F]
Can I get you all alone girl
You're more than just a homegirl
Can I take you home girl (I mean)
Can I get you home girl
Going to your home girl
I want to get you home girl
You're more than just a homegirl
I'm trying to take you home girl

(Instrumental Bridge)

[Verse 2: KYLE]
Yeah, I've been trying to get you all alone
Your homegirl playing defense, running zones
Maybe I should say fuck it and just lose
But you missed all the shots you never shoot (True)
Aye, but I've been running plays running plays
This is like the third and fourth date
I ain't hit the first night just chill
If I don't hit tonight then that ain't
That's a custom here in the states
Don't know what they do in Peru
People here would say that that's rude
Honestly I say the shit too
Listen, can I take you home girl
I don't really like to sleep alone girl
I deleted every number out my phone girl
Tonight I told the world to leave me alone girl, yeah
So baby please don't leave me on my own girl, yeah
There's still things I really want to know girl, yeah
There's still parts of you you haven't shown girl, yeah
Need a private show girl, yeah
Oh girl, yeah

[Pre-Chrous: KYLE]
Aye, I can take you to Japan if you really want to
You can turn me into a Dad if you really want to
You can drive my kids to class if you really want to
Cause I don't want to
But I want you, oh

[Chorus: Dougie F]
Can I get you all alone girl
You're more than just a homegirl
Can I take you home girl (I mean)
Can I get you home girl
Going to your home girl
I want to get you home girl
You're more than just a homegirl
I'm trying to take you home girl

(Instrumental Bridge)
