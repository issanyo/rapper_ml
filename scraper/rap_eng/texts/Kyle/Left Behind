[Intro]
Down (Johnny Juliano)
Down (Dot Com!)
Down

[Chorus]
Down lowly
Make up for the time you've wasted
Come slowly
And claim back the boy you left behind

[Verse 1]
So these lights put me in another zone
Falling out of space
Some were all alone
Out there on my own
Just me and my subconcious
Feelin' like I lived my whole life unconcious
I can't fight the fog, I can't go to sleep
And every night I feel like something's watchin' me
I tried to go and make the climb
And now my mind is left behind

[Chorus]
Down lowly
Make up for the time you've wasted
Come slowly
And claim back the boy you left behind

[Verse 2]
These nights put me in another zone
On my way home, my mind starts to glow
And then it runs away, and I don't know where it goes
And I'd call it from the fog but it don't pick up the phone
'Cuz it don't get reception out there way up in it's zone
The only way you hear him is through his microphone
I had too much stress in my life
And now my mind is left behind

[Chorus]
Down lowly
Make up for the time you've wasted
Come slowly
And claim back the boy you left behind

[Verse 3]
So the stress puts me in another zone
My mind runs and hides, wrapped up in a cocoon
So that it can fly away, to a far-off better place
But it went too far up past the stars
Got stuck in outer space
I tried flying high so that I could go and find him
But every time I do, I just get far behind him
He ran away, got lost in time
And now my mind is left behind

[Chorus]
Down lowly
Make up for the time you've wasted
Come slowly
And claim back the boy you left behind
