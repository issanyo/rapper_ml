A bunch of white bitches thats a bag of marshmallows

Fu- Fuck is you sayin', fuck is you sayin'

Raw papers (Swisher Sweets)

Hot boxin' in these bitches dreams
Add mrman2thatop a hundred thousand what im sittin' on
Real nigga yall silicon, see the team and you mad cause your bitch is gone

[Verse 3: Futuristic]
Ya, ride around like two chainz
Steel toe kicking it, Liu Kang

And they too strange, Im to main, I run the game Usain
Keep it tied down like shoe strings, that hot flow, Blue flame
Fu- fuck you mean boy my squad is W-T-F
Getcha' mind right, or you will be left
Plus your bitch snatch train her like a gym rat
No six pack and my pockets on big black

Buy a mask and switch your face thats all really you can do
Im a keep on winning cause I really don't know how to loose

[Verse 5: SK4MC]
Im pissed off
Turn on the t.v shiny ass rappers
But theyre softer than my lip gloss.
Im a big boss, got a big beard
Take big shits like Rick Ross
Recognize or get lost
You kiss girls I trick off
Then get mad and up a guy that cut his dick off
Tha- thats a ________ look inside your granny panties
Futuristic said I only get eight bars but fuck that shit

Cause I be high im a whip that trick
I ain't really buff but im a nerd I got them

[Hook]

[Verse 6: D-Why]
(The macchiato music everybody rockin' to it always stayin on some new shit)
Ahh! im the motherfuckin' man D in this bitch
To much stress I dont need that shit
Q that stress you dont need that shit
Take that off you can leave that shit
Man, they say they miss my old shit, wait until they here my new shit
A lot of people talk shit but really do they do shit
I knew in the beginning that the only way to win it was to do it by myself so im all about business
Got a lot of bad bitches man, can I get a witness
Man, can I get a benz or a car with no limit
Got a new chick she sleezy tryin fall asleep she tease me
(hold up!) my dick hard but this rapper shit to easy
Whatchin' wall street thinkin' bout money you can call me micheal thugless
You know all my cares are fuckless, all my relationships are loveless
See it's just me and my cousins and every one of us buzzin
Our video shit on all yall we do this without no budget (ahh!)
