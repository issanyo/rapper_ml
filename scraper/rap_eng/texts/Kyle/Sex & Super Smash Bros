[Verse 1]
Hey girly, whatcha name is?
Ass so fat but that waist so famish
It's all goody as long as I get a woody
You can peck peck with your neck, aw baby
Implantations, that's amazing
Where are you from? Why aren't you famous?
Bet you didn't know that my whip ain't rented
Bet you didn't know that my clothes expensive
Bet you didn't know that my girlfriend Cuban
Bet you didn't know that I don't know Spanish
No habla ingles but she wants my penis
Wait, wait remix!

[Chorus]
What's the hold up?
Take your clothes off
There's a game
In the pillows
Or on Nintendo
It don't matter, we can play
Come on, girl, let's play a game
Sex and Super Smash, sex and, sex and Super Smash Bros
Sex and Super Smash, sex and, sex and Super Smash Bros
Sex and, sex and, sex and, sex and Super Smash Bros
Sex and, sex and, sex and, sex and Super Smash Bros

[Bridge]
Told me she just might though, be nice though
Come by the new place and spend the night though
We can go all night though, with no lights though
Want me to lay the pipe though, alright though
Told me she just might though, be nice though
Come by the new place and spend the night though
We can go all night though, with no lights though
Want me to lay the pipe though, alright though

[Verse 2]
She wants me to stay close though, Yeah I know so
Me and her are taking photos minus clothes though
Know I got a little dough though, more than most though
We can be on a boat with mimosas
Flow got 'em all wet though, get a coaster
Got girls from posters trying to post up
Told her it's all good though to come over
She wanna learn how to work my controller
Right

[Chorus]
What's the hold up?
Take your clothes off
There's a game
In the pillows
Or on Nintendo
It don't matter, we can play
Come on, girl, let's play a game
Sex and Super Smash, sex and, sex and Super Smash Bros
Sex and Super Smash, sex and, sex and Super Smash Bros
Sex and, sex and, sex and, sex and Super Smash Bros
Sex and, sex and, sex and, sex and Super Smash Bros

[Interlude]
Here I come
Ah, ah
Here I come
This is fun
Yahoo
Here I come, here I come
Here I come
Woohoo!

[Chorus]
What's the hold up?
Take your clothes off
There's a game
In the pillows
Or on Nintendo
It don't matter, we can play
Come on, girl, let's play a game
Sex and Super Smash, sex and, sex and Super Smash Bros
Sex and Super Smash, sex and, sex and Super Smash Bros
Sex and, sex and, sex and, sex and Super Smash Bros
Sex and, sex and, sex and, sex and Super Smash Bros
