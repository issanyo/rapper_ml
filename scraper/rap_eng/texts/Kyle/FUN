Part 1

[Verse 1]
Saying ain't nobody can stop me, they better sit back and watch me, fo' really though
These niggas is silly though, they think that I'm floppy
No this isn't Kinko, you cannot make copies
And just cause you're a dick, gives you no right to be cocky
Feelin' like I'm holy though, flownin' like it's snowin'
Me and 4-5 of the homie's girls, acting like they know me 'cause my Rollie though
Well this is just the life of knowing you the shit
And I don't think I'm ever finna quit

[Hook]
Party at my place, we gon' be faded, it's gon' be fun
You're all invited, and I'ma bring my friends, we'll have a good time, under the sun
We'll have
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
(Getting faded)
We gon' have
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
(Fucked up now)

[Verse 2]
Well this is over fuckin' weirdo, the game had zero
Makin' white money I call it that Rob De Niro
Young cuz known to make your buzz disappear-o
One diss song will drop your followers to zero, ugh!
Ay yo doggy duder, did you really think
That you could do do do do anything as good as me?
You need a shrink yo, think you're good as me? No
If you really think so, you must really think slow
Cause you're not
See girls is on my jock round the clock, 'cause I'm probably hot
I could make a fucking country song and it'll probably bop
A yo Taylor, I'd really love to nail her
I could rock the boat if she'd let me be her sailor
Aww geez itâ€™s that leather Chuck T, shark teeth
Havin' nappy ass nigga from the V with my team uh
This is just a life of knowing that you're real
So I ain't got shit to do but chill
Yeah

[Hook]
Party at my place, we gon' be faded, it's gon' be fun
You're all invited, and I'ma bring my friends, we'll have a good time, under the sun

(Getting faded)

Me and my- me and my boo thang
We was going through some things at one point in time
And, and I don't know I wrote this song
