Okay that was a great song, let's settle down everybody
So um the other day I'm going through the grocery store when um all of a sudden
*fart noise*
*laughter*
Really?
Really, how fucking old are you?
Oh my god, oh fuck it stinks
That shit was planned too it wasn't a random one
You did that shit purposefully
The fuck is that?
Sour patch kids and fucking pork rinds?
That's dirty
Who the fuck is responsible for this, stand the fuck up
Stand up
You?
Yeah you're, you guys are a horrible fucking audience
I'm fuck this
Next song
