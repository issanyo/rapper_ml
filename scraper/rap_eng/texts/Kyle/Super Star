[Intro]
Wassup baby girl
You wanna star in my movie?
No games, no games, no games, girl
I just wanna
I just want you to star like Monroe, ooh
Ooh, I just be your supporting cast

[Verse 1: TheMIND]
I would rather buy you roses (ooh, ooh)
Not wait until them pushing daisies (ooh, ooh)
And I could take you out for dinner (ooh, ooh)
Attention's all you'll ever pay me (ever pay me)

[Pre-Chorus: TheMIND]
And if I had my way
You would star in every movie after today
I just wanna see your face
On the big screen
My favorite superstar, girl

Your perfect picture stuff is special
But perfect pictures are taken seldom
You're an action movie superhero, TV sitcom drama queen
Hollywood and hotel rooms, show me how to make a scene
Yeah, my Lisa Bonet
My world is different since she told me she loved me
I think we're soulmates
Angel on the silver screen, thank the heavens above ya, she's a

[Verse 3: Micah Freeman]
Got your picture hanging up in my room
See, the world is a stage and the stage is a world
And it's all set up for you (super)
I'm thinking lights, camera, action
If you ain't the star, then I can't imagine (super)
And you maintain the fashion
You play the part 'cause you got the passion (super)
And you stay that way to me
They can take a seat, it's your fate to be (super)
'Cause baby, basically you're my favorite girl

[Chorus: TheMIND, Julian Bell & Micah Freeman]
You're my favorite superstar, girl
You're my favorite superstar, girl
You're my favorite superstar, girl
You're my favorite superstar, girl
You're my favorite superstar, girl

[Verse 4: KYLE]
Okay, for real I'm your biggest fan
I follow you home in my creepy ass minivan
It's not weird, I'm just in love
And I ain't asking for much
But I do need you to run me that hug
I mean, shit, or a pic would be cool too
I'm a cool dude, I'm sort of a big deal on YouTube
My SoundCloud page got a couple of plays
I'm not Drake, but I been on the front page of the school news
But whatever, who's counting?
Help me spend my check, baby you be my accountant
I won't ever let a nigga ever love to see you frowning
I roast my own mama if she ever started clowning
Bring that ass here, though
I been on your ass back when niggas did the heel-toe
You make this weirdo feel like a hero
Even if your followers a zero
