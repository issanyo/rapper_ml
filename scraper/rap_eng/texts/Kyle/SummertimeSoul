[Verse 1]
It's the first of July today, you're gone
All gone
Had to tell me bye today, you're gone
All gone
You packed up your stuff today, you're gone
All gone
You went chasing the sun today, you're gone
All gone

[Pre-Chorus]
What you do if he's hot?
Go 'head, throw away your baby
What you do if he's not?
Look around for a captain save em
What you do if he's gone?
Go home, start online dating
Hope it was worth it, baby
When the sun go down

[Chorus]
Summertime soul
That's all you'll ever need's
A summertime thing
That's all you'll ever need's
A summertime fling
He'll forget you in the winter (winter)
Summertime soul
That's all you'll ever need's
A summertime thing
That's all you'll ever need's
A summertime fling
He'll forget you in the winter (winter)
When it's cold

[Verse 2]
September comes, the summer's gone
All gone
All out of sun, the summer's gone
All gone
You brought back my stuff today, but I'm gone
All gone
Tried finding my love today, but it's gone
All gone

[Pre-Chorus]
What you do if he's hot?
Go 'head, throw away your baby
What you do if he's not?
Look around for a captain save em
What you do if he's gone?
Go home, start online dating
Hope it was worth it, baby
When the sun go down

[Chorus]
Summertime soul
That's all you'll ever need's
A summertime thing
That's all you'll ever need's
A summertime fling
He'll forget you in the winter (winter)
Summertime soul
That's all you'll ever need's
A summertime thing
That's all you'll ever need's
A summertime fling
He'll forget you in the winter (winter)
When it's cold
