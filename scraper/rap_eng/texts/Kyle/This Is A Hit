[Outro]
(Hey Kyle!)
Hey, uh
Hey um, I'll be right back, I'm gonna go and do this intro-thing, about you know the album and the meanings to life and whatnot
Yeah so, you know it's a beautiful thing when a loser gets to live his dreams, you know, especially when you think
There's not many of us video game dudes who end up like me
And I mean it's hard being a teen and just thinking like, fuck I wanna sing
But I guess it's weird and I should have something to fear? Cause I was writing plays, instead of pounding beers
I told God tell me what you want me to be and I'll be it
There's a light and I see it
I swear it's true, you know, through these tunes and awkward dance moves, I can show it to you
