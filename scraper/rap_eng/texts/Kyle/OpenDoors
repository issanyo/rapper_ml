[Skit: KYLE & Lil Yachty]
Having girl problems, huh?
What? Mmm-mmm, nah
Nah, I'm good
You sound like it nigga
I only heard light-skinned niggas sing like that
Man, I don't know what it is bro
It's like girls are just so hard to understand
You-you feel me?
Nah nigga, I'm Lil Boat!
But shit, I mean when you got something good like that
You gotta 'preciate that, bro
'Cause shit like that can be here today, and gone tomorrow

[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ohh-ohh-ohh
Ooh-ohh-ohh-ohh

[Chorus: KYLE]
Call her first, call her back
Hold her phone, hold her hand
Kiss her more, listen more
Open doors, open doors
Call her first, call her back
Hold her phone, hold her hand
Kiss her more, listen more
Open doors, open doors

[Verse 1: KYLE]
Okay, you're right, I've been sort of a savage, true
I grew up with savage dudes
And when I order drinks, I rarely ask for two, my daddy too
But yeah, I'm tryin' recreate my DNA
Shady ways, stop liking pics, that ain't my ba-ba-baby's face
Make you hide it
I should make you put your whole account on private (Hmm)
Comment, "Nah she's mine" on every pic to let 'em know it's my shit
Be surprising, laugh, and make our times together more exciting (Hahaha)
Let 'em know you can't be touched
And that I vanquish he who tries it

[Pre-Chorus: KYLE]
Yeah, my heart is closed, I know I haven't let you see inside it
It's hard for me to open up, be courteous and open-minded
What it means to be the man you need, I had to redefine it
I just really had to be reminded ('minded, 'minded, 'minded)

[Chorus: KYLE]
Call her first, call her back
Hold her phone, hold her hand
Kiss her more, listen more
Open doors, open doors
Call her first, call her back
Hold her phone, hold her hand
Kiss her more, listen more
Open doors, open doors

[Verse 2: KYLE]
I don't even play this many games on my Xbox
I know I suck, I know I'm butt, I know I'm cheeks, I know I'm cheap
I know I eat, I make you pay
If I go out, I make you stay
If I took you to that concert, them tickets was prolly free
Know I hear with the lights on, and blow your back out to Chief Keef
What happened to Isley brothers, makin' love between the sheets?
Ayy, I just make you clap (ayy)
Yeah, I should make you sing (ayy)
All I ever think (yeah)
Me me me me me
Me me me me me, and you occasionally
Then back to me
I put them same old broken records on repeat
Them the ones I love to sing
Only on behalf of me, like you isn't half of we
How hard is it actually

[Chorus: KYLE]
Call her first, call her back
Hold her phone, hold her hand
Kiss her more, listen more
Open doors, open doors
Call her first, call her back
Hold her phone, hold her hand
Kiss her more, listen more
Open doors, open doors

[Chorus: KYLE & Avery Wilson]
Call her first (Call her first), call her back (Back)
Hold her phone (Yeah), hold her hand (Yeah)
Kiss her more (Kiss her more), listen more (Listen more)
Open doors, open doors
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Call her first, call her back (Call her back)
Hold her phone (Hold her phone), hold her hand (Hold her hand)
Kiss her more (Kiss her more), listen more (Mmm)
Open doors, open doors
(Oooo)

[Chorus: Avery Wilson]
Call her first, call her back
Hold her phone, hold her hand
Kiss her more, listen more
Open doors, yeah-yeah
Whoooo
Yeah, I can't forget ya
Call her first, call her back
Hold her phone, hold her hand
Kiss her more, listen more
Open doors

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ohh-ohh-ohh
Ooh-ohh-ohh-ohh
