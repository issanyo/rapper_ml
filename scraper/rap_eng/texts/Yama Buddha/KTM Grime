Mandem wanna talk shit
But never listen the perfect definition of what a fool is
A ruler Yama Buddha the rudest
I always end up winning when I lose it, mad temper
Can’t read the tracks off ya cd like a bad sector
I’m deep like lazy, bring heat like crazy, the beat like ya baby, mother’s life, I wrecked her
Poor shots, bad director
You hope to be dope could never cope with the pressure
I’m bringing back the crack the rap resurrector
Allow it! I’m fresher
If it’s on I break bones you go home on a stretcher
Yes sir! that’s how I do
Coming at ya straight outta Kathmandu
Think before you risk it, don’t get it twisted
Ya’ll pigs sick 'cause of swine flu
Mind you! the most wanted
Plus the flow is so supersonic
Headed for the summit yeah it’s ironic
Anything to everything you dream I done it
Yeah! I’m on it
You think you the guy but you miss when you try
Real talk! ain’t done shit in ya life
All that you been spitting are lies
Ya vision is fucked up like dick in ya eyes
I’m elegant, equipped with required elements
The most definite to make you sink like sediments
I meditate over the beat till I levitate elevated to the peak
Celebrate better state 7 days of the week, a renegade never late generating the heat
Demonstrate better ways to resonate the spit, relegate, decimate the best in the bizz
A delegate renovating the shit, never hesitate, devastate while taking a piss
Look! we shut down the best of parties
Don’t like me? I’m ya girls best artist
While you ain’t making a move, you parking
I push ignition like Sash Car Key (Karki)
YB on a beat and it’s over
YB acapella, still over
Bring heat like squeezing a toaster
Feed on Mcs like an eating disorder
Get deeper than the navy be
Couldn't suck if I wanted like a baby Bee
You bound to fall off like baby teeth
'cause writing a verse takes u 80 weeks
And still all you rap is ABC
Couldn't spit sick with rabies please
And since ya bitch got laid by me
I heard now you guys barely speak
Shit! You ain’t a match
Tryna change the fact that you lame and wack
Dickriding too much got ya anus packed
Flames I rap off the top till my brains is ash
Look! I come alive in the night time
Go hard like the fuck of a lifetime
Rock the show as you watch from the sidelines
Run the underground flow like a pipeline
Use my mind kinda like Einstein
On a doper addiction than white lines
I thought ya crew warned you with a high sign
I get more viewers than prime time
