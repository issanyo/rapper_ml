Shoutout to Lazy boy
I ain't lazy boy
I'm crazy boy like blaze big toys
He's your ladies boy
He's ladyboy
Ladies loves a man so he hate me boy
I got that baby face so all the bitches hello
I complete stanzas so I pack my collar
Pockets swollen of paper, ain't worrying about the dollar
And my chick, I didn't love, I didn't nobody holla
I ain't high, I'm chill and that's still
Ain't after that don't tell me I'm ill
I got that virus flow blowing outta system
You just gotta open up your mind and take a lesson up
Fresher than the weather right up it stops raining
Never under pressure you rappers entertainment
Watch what you saying, look around while you're aiming
Cause all make kneel to the ground like you praying
Yeah drop shit! We on some hot shit
Got the kiwi, got it on lock bitch
Flow so toxic, never off topic
Mind full of logic, high like a rocket
We will never stop it from ever keeping movement
Coming at you like an earthquake feel all the movement
I ain't got a proof shit, I just love do shit
Boo these new kids you could never do shit
Move it, move it, bitch on the dance floor
I raise fucker and fast forward to the back door
She confessed how she'd last for
You'll never get pussy, you're ass hoe!
Lemme ask yo who changed it
Cause 90% of the rappers do some same shit
We pay [?] we came with
You're playing hatred cause a brother became big
Get the fuck outta here! man
