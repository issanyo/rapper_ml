[Verse 1]
Remember why you'd said that
You always had to leave but never stay back
Karma's such a bitch right it makes you payback
Now you work 9 to 5, my lifestyle's laid back
The relationship is a cliche, play it out
I still remember the first day we made out
I was tryna hit out, follow your direction
You was tryna get together to the [?]
You had hurry, I know you expected
I had the words not so I selected
No second chance cause life ain't a game
Once you been screwed over, now you ain't the same
[?] all right it's all over
Cause you were the only one I was all over
Hurt me when I was getting love from all over
Now I'm done with your ass, it's all over

[Verse 2]
How am I supposed to trust you
I really loved you, I didn't even have to
Well now I say fuck you because you
Ain't the same women I used to make love to
I no longer want you, I just wanna move on
Sleep through days wake up on new dawn
I don't care you can do whatever you want
And I'm gonna do whatever, spit it like a new song
Let him do, let him go, you should never do wrong
Nobody too weak and no body too strong
Been patient for too long, now I'm exploding
Can't just fuck around, I know what's important
Middle finger to the world, holding my ballsack
I slap the shit out of the bitches who talk back
I was gone for a minute, and this is a comeback
You could go run away and never come back
