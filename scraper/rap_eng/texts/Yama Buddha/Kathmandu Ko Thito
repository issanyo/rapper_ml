[Verse 1] [Yama Buddha]
Namaste Hello
I'm a little mello
Around the yellow fellow got that inflobatic kilos
Nobody does it better, trendsetter, getting cheddar
Put my heart in the paper but writing a loveletter
[?] elegant dresser
I love to undress her and fuck her under dresser
I'm always chill like the month of december
We the illest [?] we can just remember
For having the most clever since 1987
Look at me now bitch, I'm riding every second
You can die any second try beef with the hindu
Prolly did a [?] the shit you've been through
Definitely into, putting holes in you
You can see clear picture like you got a dim view
Bitch I'm trilingual, I speak and rap
You strap that fire, cry preach and dead

[Verse 2] [Yama Buddha]
Ma hun kathmandu ko thito, boli bachan tito
Kaam kuro dhilo tara paisa bito bito
Soltini harulai aacha baisa chito chito
Bholi rakhdina kehi dhito feri hola thichomicho
Man himal bhanda chiso aakhama jwalamukhi
Holas dhulopitho saan nadekha muji
Ma lyauchu aadhihuri, baadi ani pahiro
Banaidinchu ludo-langado, laato ani bahiro
Ani herlas jahile chaak, nade dherai dhaak
Saan sabai chuur hola kuchaidinchhu naak
Ajha k herirako bhai, khadainas ki saag
Tah baagh ko khaal odeko syal yo jungle mero raaj
Saghaidinchhu kaam kaj, ma hun nepaliko chhoro
Rang gahu-goro, jang ma nikaldinchhu jworo
Jo ayo tyo moryo, lagdaina kasaiko daar
Jo bolyo tyeslai polyo aba sochera kura gaar

[Verse 3] [Pari]
Illest in the block, come [?]
Send it to the hospital
Talking to the beast, bitch you ain't got to do little
Maybe you could fool little people but not me
I'mma hurricane in your lane you couldn't stop me
Not apologizing I know its so cocky
That's just how I ride boys hand me your cocky
I'm blowing your mind #Nagasaki
Boom bitches I'm the dopest in the avenue
Haven't you seen the attitude
The sickest in the savage crew
Got you like a cabbage dude
Grab a hater by the neck [?]
Drag you in the greater cause I'm cooking faggots too
TBH hating ain't fun free online [?]
The world has changed son
Just one rule to stick by
No conditions applied
The rule is easy, there is there ain't none
