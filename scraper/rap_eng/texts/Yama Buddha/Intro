Yo! Yama!
Blue! We all records
Soda Niwas
Maitidevi, Ghattekulo-32

They says you came in the game straight out of the blues
Put your first mixtape out and it just blew
You probably don't have a clue
How's my life have been yo
4 degrees in 8 years out of window
Prolly can't bear to hear what I've been told
Been broken and joking and everything you touch been gold
Finally first like I hit that lottery bingo
Life can be bitch though
Hitting all that symbals
But when I tried mingle
Waiting for the day when I dropped my first and now I'm going single
So I can really look off to all of my people
And even if I die I wouldn't be worry to leave you
And all my brothers had rep in this city I see you
Aama how I wish I didn't have to leave you
And also all these bitches tryna scan me down to see you
But then you say love me, I can't believe you
So I have slip onto the next one
I ain't looking for love, see I just wanna sex once
Out of all these bitches, I've been in the VIP section
Might just take the next time, like the best one
