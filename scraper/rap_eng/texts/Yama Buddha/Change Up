[Verse 1]
Forget what we often say, huh I don't know the day one
But we've been down for each other since day one
I see the love when I look in your eyes
I mean, I just love that look in your eyes
Life's been book full of surprise truly
And you're the only type that ran interest to me
And you know I just do me forever never change up
You're such a beautiful person no make-up
And it's the best feeling whenever we get together
You keep me so warm, I forget the weather
Ain't nothing ever been better than  being [?] is
I would [?] away my money
Cause all I need is you by my side
You in my life, I just wanna live with you till I die
I know you want the same, there's never been the game

[Verse 2]
Everytime I feel down in my mind ok
So bring the torch around like Liberte
Got the whole town [?]

My babies, fresh like a virgin
On the iPhone, I was flirting
Late night fantasies must be in service
Tried to love in powerful
