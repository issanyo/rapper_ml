[Verse]
Yo I represent Ghattekulo-32
Dherai saan nadekha khuskai dinchhu battis
My skill like that new smartphone, everybody on this
I run this town, recognize you're the [?]
I've been over this, you've never done yet
Flow like a pandit, sunrise to sunset
On the high, on the fly shit
Only fake posers keep listen to if you don't wanna die quick
Even when I'm quiet, buzz lie like a [?]
You selling out the soul but devil wouldn't buy it
Nah, don't even cry it, cause we in the building
Check out the empire, we in the building
I[?] the apartment, look at all these papers
Since I'm independent you can only look at all these papers
Now all fake ass friend looking like I hate em
Making moves on the run, see ya later alligator

Now all these motherfuckers wanna be me see me
But I've never put no videos on the TV
True shit, I run it [?] mufuckers clueless
Wanna how I do this? fresh like a new kid
Buddha ain't a Buddhist and Yama is ruthless
All that new shit [?] all my ninja is ruthless
Useless, I'm fluent like fluid all I do is
Open up my mind and just spit it like I'm toothless
Opposite of Judas, die for the loyalty
[?] blood brothers die for the royalty
Started off with poetry, better underpressure
Now I spit it flamboyant, you better get cheddar
Never said that bigger threat, the underdogs are intellect
No wonder the god [?] against us all the odds when I feel like it
Nobody keep it real like [?] father of son of god
Would you believe me if I told you the sun is god
