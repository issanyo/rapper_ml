[Verse]
Malai thah chha keval khusi le pet bhardaina
Tara khatchhu jaba samma jyan le thegna sakdaina
Sano dekhi thulo ichhya sabai puryaidinchhu
Timi aauda aru ko baal sabailai kuryaidinchhu
Ma sadhai saath dinchhu dheraile bolchhan matra ma sadhai saath dinchhu
Ma timro sukha rah dukha sab maasdinchhu
Badlama khusi haso upahar dinchhu
Jahile chahinchha tyehile mahasus gara
Bhanchhan maya ma dukh chha rey tara mardachhu ma tah
Bishwash chha yaad garchau tada huda
Maya dinchhu yo samaaj phool ma kada huda
Euta sapana sachdai chhu, tyesaima bachdaichhu
Bartamanma bhoot herdai haasdaichhu
Ma sanga vaako sabai kura didai baaddaichhu
Mero sapai timi tyesaile jigyasa rakhdaichhu

[Chorus] x2
Timi malai maya garchhau tara k masanga runchhau
Budo huda samma pani k masanga hunchhau
Bola na, bhana nah
K chha timro tyo man ma

[Verse 2]
I know it just happened it, can't feed a family
But I work hard till my muscle can't handle it
From small to big needs, whatever I manage it
If I get work when you around, I cancel it
Just to be there for you
I know a lot of people just say, but I be there for you
I swear like air I'll be everywhere for you
Gimme the pain, I'll get rid of tears for you
Whenever you need me just feel me
I know it hurts in love but then your absence just kills me
Whenever I'm gone, I trust you miss me
Tryna make a living for my women and my children
A dream that I'm building, I wish it last more onto the future till the past
Ready to provide her everything that I have
Cause you're everything I have
So, can I ask?

[Chorus] x2
Timi malai maya garchhau tara k masanga runchhau
Budo huda samma pani k masanga hunchhau
Bola na, bhana nah
K chha timro tyo man ma
