Yeah! It's like something that I've always said
Even if i live for a hundred years, I'm always here
Baby I'm always there, night and day for you
I could never let you go away coz I care for you
Make you mine forever, prolly marry you
And we could make a house home like a family do
Coz if you ever plan to move away from ya woman
When times are hard dealing with then what kinda man is you?
But yo! this man is true, I'm a big fan of you
Don't know about other chicks but I could handle you
We could go out whenever do whatever you wanna do
Coz you're my number one and there's no number two
Baby you wonderful, an angel heaven sent
The only girl I'm comfortable with sentiments
Even when I'm very tensed, you steal smiles from me
Like! no matter what I'm always by your side honey
