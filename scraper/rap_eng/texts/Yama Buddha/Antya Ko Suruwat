Yo antya ko suruwat ho timro ra mero maya ko
Hunthyo kaile timi mero jivanma chayeko
Tara berthai ho kura garnu maya layeko
Aaba juinu chh chhuttai jivan timi bahek ko
Pida ta hunchha maan ma eklai timi bina
Sayad kaile hune chaina aaba hamro milana
Maan bujhauchhu sochi yestai raichha jivana
Aandhakar matrai katai chaina surya kirana
Timilai chahe maile tespachi paye maile
Sangai ramaye kaile feri gumaye aile
Sayad yestai lekheko thiyo hamro karma ma
These are the facts baby nabacha bhramama

Baby I used to love
Now I really don't want you
Its like a whole right in my heart
May be I should have told you
It felt really good when I hold you
Then every thing fell apart

Aba timro aashu le kei hudaina malai
Timro maya ko bhawana le chudaina malai
Jaba saath ma thiye timle bujhenau malai
Aba bhetaula feri arkai juni ma timlai
In the form of a complete stranger passing by
Look when I used to be there for you when you would cry
Now its goodbye baachna deu malai
Eklai atit ka sabai kuraharu lai bhulai
Bhanchhan mutu ko ghau samaya sangai niko hunchha
Gahiro prem thiyo mero sayad ali dhilo hunchha
Neither the brain or a eyes wanna look for you
Be glad I even composed the hook for you

Baby I used to love
Now I really don't want you
It's like a whole right in my heart
Maybe I should have told you
It felt really good when I hold you
Then every thing fell apart
