Yeah Yeah Yeah Put it down
Ah, Aye yo!

[Verse]
You lack focus, write all night and still rap bogus
Must be imaginary gun she can't show us
You hate on our steeze cause your bitch must have known us
You hopeless, tryna hold me back I'm gonna blow up
Hold up, treat your bitch to a throatfuck
No luck as she tries hard not to throw up
Yeah I did so much, in no time
[?] put hardwork in no time
Grinding up 24/7 like you got no time
All I get from bitches is head, no time
Glowing shine, like it's your time on the showtime
Flow so divine and yours got no shine
Got a strong man a big male part
You can call me hitman cause I got brave heart
It's better than graffiti the way I spray art
Bitch I run this game, you all can take part
If you make it good, if you don't fuck with it
I'm still kid becoming just for the fuck of it
Fuck these haters, all these bitches loving it
Ain't talking ain't no but you rappers is fucking shit
Better be doggy quick when I bring the ammo
One man army in the ring Rambo
Riding on [?] when these streets like a lambo
Your bitch love my dick, she calls it Mutambo
I just hit her once, she no longer wants you
Prolly want her back, but she no longer wants you
I got that mad flow, everybody asked for
Cause all these ninjas could ever grow is an afro
Me and my homies tore it down on last show
Mad hoes, act close, tryna swallow my lactose
Bitches around me only because of cash flow
You prolly ain't no hardest when you're ass broke
Shit ain't even funny like a bad joke
Been smoking rappers like tobacco since Glasgow
I got the energy flow of a star
Fast like an lightning, slow when embark
Homo you are, I'm pro when I spark
Get smacked in the face as you lower the god
It's over with start, this is more than just an art
You couldn't beat the feelings with notes in your heart
Foe Foe Foe, [?]
I rode so low, and flow is gold
Holy lord, your soul is sold
How you could be fresh when you're flows so old
The only good shit you rap is mo mo
I come hard like coco, you just so so
Hired with a mojo, frozen like a photo
I'm the prototype, use loco
Don't [?] mind me and my music
Every single record I drop is a new hit
