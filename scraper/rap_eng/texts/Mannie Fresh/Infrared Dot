Magnolia in this bitch
That Melph, that Calio, VL, 10th Ward, everybody, check it

Turk:
Untamed gorillas
Uptown for sho'
Gettin' full of that raw Mac Melph Calio
Totin choppers on the street like it's very legal
Lovin' blue eyes and curly hair cuz that's fuckin' people
These niggas wet, head smokin' from his beretta led
Shouldn't fuck with niggas in that 3 cuz they surely don't play
Chop you down in a minute
Yo' head, quick to spin it
Set it off with 50 shots
Ain't no stoppin' till it's finished
Rag tag, leave ya fizad with bullet holes
On yo bizack with bloody clothes you know
Thug niggas
Like sockets we plug niggas
Head busters
Showin' no love ass niggas
Bout beefin'
At night they bout that creepin
Tearin' it down
No more DJ's for the weekend
Chop you down real quick
Like that razor Gillette
Body acceptin' bullets like 1-800-Collect

Chorus (Juvenile):
Livin' in that 3rd where niggas got shot
They got 9 millis and infrared dot
A buncha niggas totin' choppers that's quick to wet you up
I said them niggas from uptown don't give a mother fuck
(repeat)

Turk:
Part 2
And you know, what we bout, them hustles
Still niggas, kill niggas, work for the men with shovels
Still nigga, fuck with that 3 it's a must that you die
Real nigga, ??? got on a box with camoflauge
Macs, SK's, Choppers, that's all we play
Spin up in at night, big nuts from broad day
Leavin' yo' block wet
Don't give a fuck who get hit
Bangin' and kill
So if you get split you get split
In that UPT, they got that monkey on they back
Niggas in that 3 won't hesitate to leave ya crack
If you slip in Uptown, then you fucked nigga
Pullin' triggers full of that brown ducked out nigga
Totin' choppers
That's wet ya leave ya foul nigga
Uptown don't give a fuck, and they wild nigga
In that Magnolia, nigga knock ya head off ya shoulders
Reload to LD will fuck clean over ya
Left with no figgas
Fucked up from 50 niggas
6 ft. is where you'll be
On t-shirts is ya picture

Chorus

Turk:
In that 3 we pack 2's that'll bruise when we spit
Choppers with 50, so it ain't no way we won't hit
Playin' a game with no rules so you get crept on
Red dots beamin' u better have your vest on
Uptown consists of nothin' but them real niggas
Packin' steel niggas
Won't hesitate to kill niggas
Sharp shooter ?????? nigga at far range
Killin' you niggas ain't no thang so yo' brains hang
Choppers be ringin' like a motherfuckin' church bell
Niggas get served like a junkie with a drug sell
Runnin' shop is them off of ???
???? and they strapped with autillary
In that Melph, niggas will leave ya where ya standin
Poppin' trunks and they pullin' out the cannons
Pullin' triggers that'll soak ya leave ya brainless
50 shots will stop ya
Body be flamin'

Chorus x 2
