[Chorus]
Trunk knocking when I drive, my sub came alive
Transformer in my ride, my sub came alive
When them hoes outside, my sub came alive
They saying bass died, my sub came alive
(It's alive!) My sub came alive
My sub came alive
(It's alive!) My sub came alive
They saying bass died, my sub came alive

[Verse 1]
Caught you on the creep while everybody gone to sleep
A dog off the leash (woof!) the only way it speak
Motherfuck all them tweeters, that's the same for police
I never tone it down on some round in the streets
Come alive with the ball, crack curb by the yard
Bust the seats out the back, a monster's in the car!
If the monster went and start, it only come in large
Come alive for the star, but it came from my garage

[Chorus]
Trunk knocking when I drive, my sub came alive
Transformer in my ride, my sub came alive
When them hoes outside, my sub came alive
They saying bass died, my sub came alive
(It's alive!) My sub came alive
My sub came alive
(It's alive!) My sub came alive
They saying bass died, my sub came alive

[Verse 2]
Automatic quake make em' automatic shake
It's hard to feel your face, way on Mars feel the bass
Make a Martian, make Earth a target to get a taste
Ain't no room for yo' busted luggage, I'm out of space
In the trunk once it start to thump, I can't turn it down
It's too live for the pictures on your wall to survive
Outside talking, keep it quiet, I'ma kill your vibe
15s like it's Frankenstein, watch it come alive

[Chorus]
Trunk knocking when I drive, my sub came alive
Transformer in my ride, my sub came alive
When them hoes outside, my sub came alive
They saying bass died, my sub came alive
(It's alive!) My sub came alive
My sub came alive
(It's alive!) My sub came alive
Then I heard "boom!" from the amplifiers

[Bridge]
Oh my sub, it knock and it bang
From the lows to the highs, it shakes the whole frame
Of the old school whip, it swang whenever I come through
I've been basing all night long
My sub won't do me wrong
All night long
My sub keep subbing on

[Verse 3]
Cause when I'm outchea on the creep for a speaker freak
Let me, let me EQ all her lows just to hit her peak
On the light, backrub in the backseat, tweeters where the stash be
I can't hear no lames over this bang, so please don't ask me
'Bout turning down, all this all this sound that it surround
Fuck the law, I'm gon let it bang til' it crack the ground
Bending curves, swanging and I swerve on the boulevard
Only me and God and you could never ever turn the knob

[Bridge]
Oh my sub, it knock and it bang
From the lows to the highs, it shakes the whole frame
Of the old school whip, it swang whenever I come through
I've been basing all night long
My sub won't do me wrong
All night long
My sub keep subbing on

[Outro]
New bass
That's new bass
More bass
New bass
That's new bass
