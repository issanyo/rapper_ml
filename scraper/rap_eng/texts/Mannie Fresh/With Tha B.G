And we greedy like some hungry tigers ikn this rap feezy

But for now got to Strails and get a nigga some steak and fetticeezy
So I can go by one of my hoes with a full steezy
And watch this ho scuff up to her kneezy
And send the video tape back to B.Geezy
And when finish hand it off to Man Feezy
And when he finish won't he toss to Suga Seezy
Fuckin' with my B.Geezy
