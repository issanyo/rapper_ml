(Baby)
Shhhhh, nigga drinkin don pie, and crystal (Huh Bra?)
All that in the ass, fuckin these hoes, ballin till we fallin
Drankin too much, but its all good (all good)
Its all gravey dog watchin they dogs come out

(Baby)
Thugged out, when I met the president
Reeboks and Girbuads, when he came into my residents
Vest up cuz I ain't trust the hoes who we fuckin wit
Three years in 86 and the mayor supportin mah shit
Wasn't pickin no cotton for no redneck, Bitch!
And I wouldn't fuck foxy with another nigga dick
Been slick doin this shit since 86
Scarred wit mah neck and my tattoes on mah wrist
And my motto is I'll fuck a bitch
Cash checks quick and I done payed my dues to this rap shit
Competition catchin' the blues 'cause we comin' with that raw shit
That brown layed down shit
Stack your cheese wit a tape that's fire slick
And bees like butter fresh got 'em runnin' to the store quick
And it cost half a key to see my in the club slick
And sure 'nuff I dont wanna see no blood slick
And it cost a whole key to see me in the stadium, Bitch!
And ill put that on the bezzle if you dont belive that shit

(Juvenile)
I ain't givin up shit, everything I got I earned
Nuthin for free, up in this world is what I learned
Backdown for what, I know them playas up in that cut
And they tapin us, my shot they can't wait to bust
So all you niggas slow down, you drawin more heat
I read it in the paper already , they say they gonna sweep
A brother doin 10-9, im fuckin with you clownz
Nigga done take his charge, so mah people went down
Get some were you ain't got nuthin to do?
Im ballin now, I dont time to be fuckin witch you
Me and chilly ride hod , ready to ball like a dog
Get full of that hen and that dro' until we fall
Dont answer the phone , cuase they got us under survalliance
Look in the real b , You dont know them people tralin?

(Chorus)

Drop, Drop, Drop it like its hot
Watch out ,watch out drop it like its hot
Whoa, whoa drop it like its hot
Watch out ,watch out drop it like its hot

(M. Fresh)

Who the only nigga you know that'll hassle a bitch
Who the only nigga you know that'll Harass a bitch
Fresh miggity, Big Dickity, do the liggity
Then you my baby boo, Fo shiggity
You done seen me, got the super weeny
Ridin with a bitch in the blue Lambourgini
Muggin while she between me
Eatin Hizucks, Beatin Dizucks
Suckin till she catch the Hizucks
When I shoot the rizzucks, I like 'em I love and I smash
I hit 'em qiuck in a mash, till the kat K Robbin,Weebon and Bobbin
Big lip Slobbin on the telephone poles (Whoa)
The pickle has no heart, in the middle of the dark
If u can't finish this shit you shouldt have start, with a big-dick birdie man
23 year old dirty man, pull of yer skirt and then grab your hand
And let you insert, Da Man

(Chorus)

(Cadillac)
Baby im'a ctach my cut from saratoga unravelin
Tryin to twist 'em with the shit, with brite gangsta unravelin
Runnin of on mah shit, Tryin to take what was mine
But im'a gip with mah shit from 6 figures to the last dime
Cieze my bank account and I still got my drug bout
If I was runnin with them niggas then i'd be crossed up
Im'a ball till I fall, What you think I was playin?
I like cars and broads, but im real with this rap thing
I still got mah buildins, still gonna make a million
Im'a slang these rocks, from all the way up, They killin 'em
Take it how you want it, I ain't got shit for the doubt
Till im finished with the life, asked slim its a mougt

(Baby)
How you luv that?, Bitch!

(Chorus)
