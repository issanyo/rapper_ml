{Verse 1: Mr. Ivan (MF as Devil)}
From time to time I hear that voice inside my mind
Me thinks me going crazy, I hear that voice all the time
Reminiscin' on the time I need a come up
Then went paranoid now I need to jack a nigga to make a buck
Double-up on a motha fucka with some bankin
Jackin by to shootin on top of cats and leavin them stankin
I hear that voice in my head sayin (KILL A BITCH!)
Picked up me 9, he started tellin me this:
(IF YOU KILL THAT NIGGA I'mma GET YA LITTLE BUICK FIXED
HELP YOU GET SOME RIMS, A PAINT JOB, A STEREO AND SHIT!, [HAHAHAHA])
See now I'm squirmin about the deal that was made
Did what I had to do, did all the tricks of the trade
I killed that nigga and my very wish was granted
Just like a flower in the ground this nigga was plantin
Now thats a job well done, with a Ruger 9 gun
Now I'mma murdera the devil got me sprung nigga
(YOU DO OFF WITH THEM I'mma GIVE YOU A HOE, GET YA NOTE UP
YOU'LL GET ALL YOUR DOPE DEALS IN THE MELPHAMEINE!)
Its all good, now I carried the dots with the quickness
I kill 'em all dead, I'm slingin that blood on that ass bitch
I made that come up, not caught slippin, they comin to get me
Blast on that ass until I'm sittin (UP IN MY ROOM!) fuck ya nigga
(NOW YA DOIN TIME!) Ain't this a bitch? its just the devil inside me nigga

(HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA, YEAH
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HAAAAAAA)

{Verse 2: Mr. Ivan (MF as Devil)}
Fa some reason they finally let me out the penetenchary
Thinkin it back, thinkin back like, what that voice said to me?
He showed motha fuckazz its all about havin things
Do what I had to do, get straight, get it right, ya dig what im sayin mayne?
(YEAH) Get out the gear, grab my Tec from the shop
Takin' it off, breakin em off, thinkin bout suttin im doin by myself
This voice inside me started speakin again repeatin:
(EVERYTHING I GAVE YOU BACK IN THE PAST IS WHAT YOU NEED YEAH
YA SCARY ASS SHOULDA LEFT 'EM DEAD
I GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT THIS TIME BLAST ON THAT ASS WITH YO HOCKEY MASK [MUHAAAA])
I'm doin alotta bullshit just to get what I want
I gotta kill, steal cars, steal money and dope but still I wanna flow
I draw them all down with the motha fuckin slug
The punk motha fucka's dead and no they ain't gon get no kind of love
Gotz to peel caps with the fuckin Ruger 9'n
Kickin it with the devil, makin it sure that we gettin our mind'n
Gatz fa snapz I can not figure

(HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA, YEAH

VERSE 3, G)

{Verse: 3 (MF as Devil)
Commintin murders, doin what this motha fucka tell me
Got me hooked on crack I can't believe he tryin to shell me
(SHOOT OFF SOME HEROIN IN YO VAINS I'LL GET YOU A HOUSE!)
Addicted like they was Tic-Tacs, fa the crew I'm gettin strung out
(SHOOT IT IN YA ARMS AND YOUR NECK AND YOUR CHEST!)
So I could end up in a coffin?
(DO WHAT I SAY AND I'mma HANDLE THE REST, YEAH!)
He got me dreamin fa the lies he been told me
Weither you know it or not its just the Devil thats controllin me
Sheeit there ain't no way for me to get out, I'm strung out, I can't stop
This voice is screamin inside me: "Do what I'm sayin daddy"
I started murderin, robbin, slangin that white shit
I'm too far gon from my own, half I'm a dead bitch
(FUCK YA RUGER 9 I WANT YOU TO BLAST ON A BITCH!)
Whateva, this motha fucka tell me is what the fuck I did
I'm obligated, it doesnt matter if I kill a bitch
Blast and blast, then a mother fucka splitted my wig
Bleedin to death, when the police shit done pull
Bought a one way ticket straight to hell and this satan fool:
(THAT ASS IS MINE, YOU SHOULDN'T OF NEVER PULLED THE TRIGGA!)
I'm dead, burnin in hell, its just the Devil inside me nigga...

(HA HA HA HA HA WUSSUP NIGGA?
