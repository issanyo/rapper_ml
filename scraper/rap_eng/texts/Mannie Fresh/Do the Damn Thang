Do the damn thang! Ya dun-da-dunts! ..

[repeat "Do the damn thang" in background of intro]

[talking]
In the west, they do the damn thang..
In the east, they do the damn thang..
In the south, they do the damn thang..
In the north, they do the damn thang..
The whole world, do the damn thang..

[Mack 10]
I do the damn thang, I let my nuts hang
And of course I'ma Inglewood swang (swang..)
Off the top - fuck cops!
Rollin through the hood in an ol' school drop
Six fo's - pimp those
Hoes after shows with the SWAT meet cothes
Low-ride - Wessyde!
And all bitch-ass niggas betta hide
Big wheels - ex-peels
I sign nuttin but eight-figure deals
Shoot blocks - sell rocks
Mack 10 got the block on lock (do the damn thang)
Crack bitches - get riches
Stay gangsta and FUCK all snitchas
Bust nines - flatlines
Killa Cali riders and gang signs

[Chorus]
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. (wha?)
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. (wh-wha?)
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. (wha?)
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. (who?)
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. (who?)
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. *vocal scratching*

[Mack 10]
Long braids - bandanas (long braids)
Three mil' on a house in Atlanta (hot man)
Test coupes - triple beams
And keep work for the neighborhood fiends
Starched khakis - red chucks (get your walk on)
Red everythang, cars and trucks (gon' do it like that?)
Yes y'all and - big ballin
Shut the town down nigga, shot callin
Fo' life - with stripes (AH-HA!)
CMR keep it crackin all night (see that)
Dominoes - dice games
G'd up and I got hood fame
Westside - platinum chains
Waistline, that's my new thang (wes-syde!)
All year - fresh gear
Cross a nigga, fuck around and disappear

[Hook]
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang..
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang..
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang..
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang..
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. (uh-uh.. uh-uh..)
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. (uh-uh.. wha?)
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang..
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. *vocal scratching*

See.. see.. see..
"Do the.."

[Mack 10]
Bitch please - six threes
Candy paint with the triple gold D's
Big drums - load clips
Close range with the hollow-point tips
Twenty cars - ten bikes
Chuck Taylor's or the Air Force Nik's
Throat peelers - get scrilla
My whole crew ex-cons and killaz
Inglewood - is my hood
Represent and it's all to the good
Fast cars - big stars
Hundred thou on every 16's doors
Fuck you - and yo' crew (uh-huh?)
Whattchu bitch-ass niggas wanna do?
Let it rain (oh) - and make ya pay (oh!)
Get money nigga do the damn thang!

[Hook]
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. (oh, oh)
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang..
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. (Mack 1-0)
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. (CMR, Hoo-Bangin)
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. (do the damn thang)
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. (you see it)
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. (you see how I say)
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. (I know you see how I say)
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang.. (ya dun-da-dunts)
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang..

[talking]
See, you do the damn thang
If you still gon' sleep witcha baby mama
Cuz you know it's gon' be drama
But you take care of yo' kids
You done the damn thang (do the damn thang)
When you go back to the hood, knowhamsayin?
And lay it down (do the damn thang)
Buyin Cutlass's and all that kinda foolishness whatever
You do the damn thang  [repeat "Do the damn thang" in background]
Knahmsayin? See how I'm sayin..
If you a ugly dude and you got a whole lotta money
And the chicks jock you, then you do the damn thang!
And you know you ugly and you got some bad chicks
You do the damn thang.. you feel that?
If you a ugly chick or you was fine once
You know where you was fine and then ate it
And you might bust right now, and you big ya dig?
In the two thousand, if they still jock you, then you do the damn thang!
.. y'all see's how I say it, do the damn thang...
