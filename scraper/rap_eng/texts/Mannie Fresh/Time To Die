Volume 1

[Verse 1]
One time to live, one time to die
I'ma ride at night, nigga hoping I'ma [?]
Man erase the haters [?]
Pray for their life, forget anyway
I'ma wake up today
I'm addicted to the drug, in the streets people be hating
I told myself until I motherfuckin' rest
Man, I pick my battles, I'm a the fucking banger
I'ma react to the head on a nigga retainer
Didn't know the boss so I had to detain him
Caught one body, he ain't even gon' frame him
Turn one fight into the time that he laid him
On the backstreet nigga, couldn't nobody save him
[?] that I raised him
I know you, you a motherfuckin' copy
Found the dude, had to do that shit sloppy
I ain't tryna say I'm no gangsta
But you ain't gonna be real to have this motherfucking anger
Catch you on your court nigga, you up in danger
Never thought of the day you would be an angel
Fuck the faking, nigga green no money
Nigga fuck the system, niggas gon' die tryna please they missing
Can't stand the heat, get the fuck up out the kitchen
Feeling like my life is at the crossroads
White dude nigga, turn on your [?]
I ain't never been so I gotta go hard nigga

[Interlude]
Yeah, real talk

[Verse 2]
Cause they all got the books of life
I took a page man, they guns is in the clouds
Man he walking with a hand in hand
Nigga he still fucking the bitch man, broke her heart
Niggas trapped in the mindset
Real men, not real niggas
And I'm a black man, white man
Green man, blue man, tan man
Yellow man, yellow man
Brown man, brown bag
With the liquor and the Funyons in it
I be dusting out store nigga like it's nothing
Niggas be hating and I love it
I put the pistol in his ass and make that bitch go fuck it
Motherfuck this, ain't a discussion man
You fuck with Lil B, give his ass a concussion
And I'm [?]
I don't bother nobody, I be chillin', I'm hustlin'
Nigga and I be wanting the billions
Man it's real easy
My kids in the future, I don't want nothing
Play ten, nigga had the [?]
Nigga I talked to my dad and I still think he a bitch
Just cause I rhyme, nigga fuck that shit
Nigga fuck their feelings
[?] dump 'em in it nigga
Nigga we rocking and we rocking
Got ten blocks and I hope they stop it nigga
I hope they don't rock 'em, hit em with the chopper
Niggas sit his ass down, make him look like his father
Or a old nigga, really fucking moldy
Nigga can't do this shit, you really think he holy
His body all holy man
That nigga look like he praying cause he all holy
Cause he stay holy, bitch

[Outro]
Lil B man, let's get it
