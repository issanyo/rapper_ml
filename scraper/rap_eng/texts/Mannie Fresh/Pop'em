[Intro]
D.O.T. mutha-fucka
Lomo five [?]
Peace out to my cousin Loc and that mutha-fuckin [?]
Don't ever let my nine, uh

[Verse One]
The world is mine and I don't even know it yet
From ever side of the game I face death
Mutha-fuckas that I try to [?]
That's why I instantly fell in love with my heat
A.K.'s clip but I have no knowledge of this
Until a cheesy rat from the Rat Pack ratted out his own clique
And kicked me down with the plot
But fool I'm two steps ahead thinking [?]
Creepin down my block with the cock Glock ready to booyaka booyaka nigga [?] you know
Kept the airflow I obtained on the down-low
Wanting to disregard, then I thought hard
If I get into it with this man and take his life
Would that be it for me? Would that be it for me?
Would the penitentiary be in my future
If I had to [?] mutha-fucka with my Ruger
Cause fool I'd rather do ya, than deal with ya
Just like my big ol' nigga Bun B from B.A.T. but y'all don't feel me though

[Hook]
It's just that simple, pop you like a pimple
Don't ever let my 9 catch your temple, nigga
It's just that simple, pop you like a pimple
Don't ever let my 9 catch your temple, nigga
It's just that simple, pop you like a pimple
So don't ever let my 9 hit your temple, nigga
It's just that simple, pop you like a pimple
So don't ever let my 9 hit your temple, nigga

[Verse Two]
With my back against the [?] up with the squad then you might catch a [?]
Right to left it'll [?]
I promise if I don't get to that [?] squeeze the [?]
I'mma throw them things and knock you to your knees with my [?]
Cause all these bustas tryna kill me and what's happening?
Gotta be saving my neck so it's them things that I be grabbing
If they wanna play with toys [?] Toys 'R' Us
The D.O.G., fools straight killer come test [?]
We put down the mutha-fucking mic so we can go
Cause ain't no studio in [?]

[Hook]
It's just that simple, pop you like a pimple
So don't ever let my 9 catch your mutha-fuckin' temple
It's just that simple, pop you like a pimple
So don't ever let my 9 catch your mutha-fuckin' temple
It's just that simple, pop you like a pimple
So don't ever let my 9 catch your mutha-fuckin' temple
It's just that simple, pop you like a pimple
So don't ever let my 9 catch your...

[Verse Three]
[?], that I'm official
[?] ass in a blood pool mutha-fucka
Just 'cause a nigga don't talk that shit, I'd rather walk that shit
And let the pistol meet your face bitch
Round one, round two mutha-fuckin three four
Now all remains are your brains paintin' up the floor
It's all good when [?] tonight
But I got my nigga Skull Duggery rollin' in the ride with me
[?] to the mac-o just scoop that nigga Jack-o
Jack's just what we should call him cause that's what he be hauling
Totin' on blunts and snorting powder to get high
But now my demons are feining and ready for the fight
I'd rush out right as we dip through the city
Rolling back to the hood where the nigga said he would kill me
Well let's [?]
Cause I be fucked if they gone get me, and I don't catch [?]
Pull out my pistol and poppers 'til all my enemies droppa
Click clack my shit shot, home and fucked my bitch
Cause a (Nigga)
Fool it's just that simple
Don't ever let my 9 catch your temple, nigga


[Outro]
1995 shouts out to the nigga who think I'm [?]
[?] yous a bitch
If you think a nigga can't come with that rich
Shouts out to all my niggas who buy my tape
And if you don't buy my tape you will get raped ya biatch
Lil bo 5 [?]
Suck a nigga dick then get the fuck off me hoe
Nigga all these bitches in the house
I'm riding to fuck [?]
