House real big
Cars real big
Dick real big
Everything real big
Rims real big
Pockets real big
Rings real big
Let me tell you how I live

Like that buy that 24's ride that
Ladies, Gentlemen
Gangstas, Pimps
Bitches, hoes
Stunnas, Shiners
I'm rich bitch, I'm a fuckin' Big Tymer

[Verse 1]
King of the hood, everything wood
Look like a forest in that bitch and I'm a put
Matchin sofa set, big open deck
Hardwood floors in that bitch that connect
From the front to the back, nigga top that
Six 15's in the muthafuckin' deck
Push that button, microwave oven
I'm just gettin' started pimp, you ain't seen nothin'
"Is that a fish tank, burrowed, in the middle of the dash?"
Yeah pimpin' don't put your fingers on my glass!
Got a two lane bowling alley up in the truck
And on the other side a bed if she wantin' to fuck
Clap off lights when you get an affection
Clap on lights when you find the protection
Now where iin the wide wide world of gator
Can you ever find a truck with a plush elevator?

[Verse 2]
Here I come so, so right (Right on!)
In the shoes so, so wide (Dynamite!)
Hey y'all peep the outfit
Wait a minute, hold up just a big dick (Back up, workin' with a monster)
Now everybody knows I got the shiniest clothes (Me!)
And everybody know who got the baddest hoes (Me)
Then white boys go wild "He's my idol"
And black boys say "Dude holdin' the title"
As the king of the south
Work it in and out
And a nigga still pimp white teeth up in his mouth
I'm the truth from the boot shawty, what you wanna see?
I ain't gotta get money man, money get me
Yeah, pimpin' still blindin' (BLING!)
Keep a Steve Harvey linin' (Edge it up)
And I'm leather reclinin' (Laid back)
With the music Alpinin'

[Verse 3]
Move ho, I ain't playin'
Land in the projects in a big jet plane
Roll out in a old ass Chevy van
With your baby mamma cookin' rookie cause I can
I do it on the real
Your bitch jockin' stunna grill
I do it on the real
Your bitch jockin' stunna grill
'Bout to clown put it down y'all, swing my nuts
Show all y'all niggas how to do donuts
Round and round and round (Skkrrrt! Stop!)
This the part where I give my phone number to all the girls thats hot
Dial 976 that outside dick
Or 874 deep down in yo' throat
Have you ever seen a big stretch truck like that?
Now have you ever seen a big bitch butt like that?
Budonkadonk all out of her pants
With a bowlegged cowboy stance (Yeeehaw!)
