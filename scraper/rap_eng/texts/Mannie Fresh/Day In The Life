This is a day in the life
See I make big money and I fuck nigga's wives
And I only skate twenty fours
Young pimpin' still slammin' them Chevrolet doors

This is a day in the life
See I make big money and I fuck nigga's wives
And I only skate twenty fours
Young pimpin' still slammin' them Cadillac doors

Got my old-school Chevelle and it's ruby brown
And that car make that vroom-vroom, sk...rrrrt sound
When I pass by your place they say, "Turn down the base"
But I keep on turnin' it up
I know you don't like me talkin' bout you won't fight me
Jump brave Dave show me what's up (I'm not sure about this line)
Movin' on to some other things, I just want some chicken wings
With a little barbecue sauce

Save my money young honey
What the fuck, is you a dummy?
She actin' like your ass is the boss
That sign say McDonalds, not Mac Kim's
Actin' like your shy with them dirty-ass Tims
Move over Range Rover
I'm comin' in this bitch much colder
In a chromed out, shagged out Escalade
With the base turned up sittin' peanut butter suede

This is a day in the life
See I make big money and I fuck nigga's wives
And I only skate twenty fours
Young pimpin' still slammin' them Chevrolet doors

This is a day in the life
See I make big money and I fuck nigga's wives
And I only skate twenty fours
Young pimpin' still slammin' them Cadillac doors

I'm thirty five years old and I'm filthy rich
And by the way, dude, I been fuckin' your bitch
And I get her buck naked ridin' up in the 'Vette
And every time she see me her pussy get wet
You might love your baby mama but I like her a lot
For real though, dude, you ain't got what I got
And that little girl buddy, she look like Wayne
Maybe you should think about changin' her name

I got another story lemme tell you how it go

'Bout a football nigga that was fuckin' my ho
He was hangin' with the tramp like day and night
But what dude don't know is that I'm fuckin' his wife
And by the way mistah
I even fuck your sistah
I got your mama fucked up payin' all of my bills
And your grandmother bought me some spinnin' wheels

This is a day in the life
See I make big money and I fuck nigga's wives
And I only skate twenty fours
Young pimpin' still slammin' them Chevrolet doors

This is a day in the life
See I make big money and I fuck nigga's wives
And I only skate twenty fours
Young pimpin' still slammin' them Cadillac doors

I stay sharp from my head to my belt to my toes
Call me rubberband man cuz I keep bank rolls
Please rookie be with no ten percent ho (I'm not sure about this line)
Unless your paint super wet and your rims fully grown
A lot of y'all niggas say I shine too much
Well...kiss my ass
Y'all can suck my fuckin' nuts
Got little chrome jets
With living room sets
And every time I pass your baby mama turn her neck

When I come through bitches go, "Ooooh, oooooh"
Niggas go, "Who are you?"
Nigga I'm a show you
I'm shortest that you ever seen
Pimpin' stay super clean
Shoes to the pants to the shirt
Do my own sheen
Five million dead white boys in the bank
And the check that the Wheels brothers gave me is blank
Got five million, nigga, put away for the fam'
And five million comin' nigga shit GOD DAMN!

This is a day in the life
See I make big money and I fuck nigga's wives
And I only skate twenty fours
Young pimpin' still slammin' them Cadillac doors
