[Verse 1]
I'll bust you in your motherfuckin mouth for talkin
The beef starts in here, and 1 of us ain't walkin
Hope you got your Girbuads and your Reeboks strapped on tight
Cuz it's gon' be some shit I'm bout to do that you won't like
Picture this, a chrome pipe, up to your dome hot
I was a bitch before I drew down, now you got a new sound
You found a nigga that you thought was a ho
Took something from your family, that you valued the most
Chose to beef, chose to creep, but my lady
She's pregnant from me
She's 5 months, so we lookin at oh, a three?
Before my baby bout to touch down
Cause man I gotta live can't get my head bust now
I'm Bustin at niggas, grieving over my partners that's gone
All my P's in the projects with a lotta that chrome
Playin a chess game, gotta keep my eye on the next man
I dont know you from adam and eve, but I can vouch for me

[Hook]
I take It off your shoulder
Nigga I'm thuggin in the magnolia
You better do what I told ya
Unless you want to get fuck over

[Verse 2]
Watch yourself, it's getting bad and dangerous
We bout that foolishness, so niggas scared to hang wit us
[?] dressed up in black
Ridin around every ward ready to jack
It ain't used to be like that, till the drought rolled round'
Now niggas occupationally kickin' them doors down
Curly head on my back 24/7
And If I gotta deal with these niggas and bitches with 2-11
What do you call them niggas that are duckin the law (Hot)
Who them niggas who just shot up your car
What you call them niggas that be ready for war (Hot)
What you call them niggas that be goin too far
Hot Boys running with kerosene running through everything
Doing shit, that you never seen
To Mag, to the Yo to the Melphamine
Niggas talk bout me but very seldom I'm seen
Juvi duckin them feds, runnin around with pimp Reg
Clockin' the K's puttin' hallow lead into your head
My enemies fled
They gon get Murdered [?]
Some motherfucker claiming that he representin
But He ain't from the nolia, so this shit ain't worth me listening
This is my system
Like an addiction interrogatin the minds of
My victim's they can't see becuz they bitchin it's takin
I'm making doubters out believers
When my blood pressure get high hold up yo dick beater, cause
This Nigga, will not be hut, we livin in that UTP
And in God we trust
Last of the real niggas in the Jects' went nuts
And you will teach yo' niggas to be respecting us, uh-huh..

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If I wasn't a thinker, I'll probably be dead right now
One of these niggas quick to bust my head by now
But liable now, I'm still survivin, cool and konivin'
Now I got my enemy drivin, I know that nigga be robbin'
Imma tell that nigga let me out at the light
And when he put that bitch in park, thats the end of his life
2 or my people, look nigga I got a plan
And when I see 200 keys of that sand
I'm a marked man, so I'll put that shit in yall hand
I'mma be shotcallin, all of my niggas ballin
Juve you bout it
Wayne is you bout it
Turk you bout it
Slim you bout it
Derrick you bout
Baby you bout it
Fresh you bout it
Tank is you bout it
Co is you bout it
B.G., ballers you buyed it
You and you, you buyed it
This motherfuckin investigation on me?
This bitch I was fuckin' gave information on me?
And it's gonna be a bitch to beat these alligations
They tried to torture me with questions at the police station
If theres boo-ku operation's
They'll inject the streets with playa hatin, tell'em I'm turnin statin
Niggas gonna be waiting, fuck that, I'd rather take my chances
Hit the Bitch in a minute, I rearrange advanced shit

[Hook]
