Aw.....I'm comin' through the fog
Dressed in black
Knock Yo muthafuckin' head off
Bitch nigga stop playin' wit me

[Verse 1]
Spark it up make it happen, grab your piece
You deceased, fuckin' with me, oh it's pure beef
Tragedy, homicide, battle me out there
Nothin' in between but air, bitch I don't play fair
I come through like an Amtrak, what'cha gone do?
Got a strap but it's on safety, mine ready to let loose
I hit'cha spot, niggas scatter
I ratta-tatta, whatever it don't matter
Hollows come out like blat-blatta
Gotta shop across town, applied it so they doomed
Soon as it hit Noon I'm blastin' off in the room
First thing flinch I go boom
With the sweeper I sweep like a broom
Creep like the Grim Reaper leavin' everything wound
When the Moon come out, that's when the snakes come out
The fakes go in, you got it, hide out in the drought
You leave a gap open I'm squeezin' it cuz I'm scopin', hopin'
I can catch a nigga with some birds just locin'
So I can uh-abuse the bitch
Misuse the bitch, refuse me then his family gone lose the bitch
I'm colder than ice, I'm smoother than sand
Baby Gangsta headbusta just a clean up man

[Hook]
On dangerous grounds, with the K off in my hand
Ready for me to blast I'ma clean up man
On dangerous grounds, with the K off in my hand
Ready for me to blast I'ma clean up man
On dangerous grounds, with the K off in my hand
Ready for me to blast I'ma clean up man

[Verse 2]
B.G., Hot Boy, leave ya dick in the dirt
Ride with Juvey, Lil' Wayne, and Turk
Puttin' faces on shirts
You know tuh-uh-together, we acts a ass
Fifty shots, out each clip we blast
Full of that trash, out the St. T
We mash on the gas
Hangin' out the window, hit the heat
Apply pressure to yo head nigga
And little bullets take red from yo head nigga
Should have watched your mouth and not said what you said nigga
But uhn-uhn-uhn, now that nigga's dead, nigga
It's All On U
If you got beef, would you freeze, ha nigga?
Grab the ass kicker and hit the enemy block nigga?
If you got beef would you squash it and eat it?
Make a nigga bleed, or think it's cool and now you eatin' it?
If you got beef would you try to sleep on it?
If it's with me you ain't thinkin' cuz I'll creep homie
If you got beef  better squeeze trigga nigga
Kill it no matter what even if it takes four weeks nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I come hard enough, ya feelin' me?
Fa shiggedy
Bitch niggas gone get they wiggadys splitti, splitti
You done pissed these niggas off from Chopper City
In each and every K we tote, they got fifty
So bring it on however you wanna bring it on
Yo block explode like a bomb
I'm dangerous and armed
The B.G. Get it How I live til' I'm gone
I'ma H.B., and gotta get my shine on
So when the gangsta situation's starin' at you
Nigga look the other way or do what'cha gotta do
I'm quick to leave all the choices on you
Gotta trigga happy clique ask questions after they shoot
The people in blue can't even take the scene I leave
If ten niggas on the block, then ten niggas I leave
Now Frank Minyard got work for three weeks
That's how the U.P.T. play it if we got beef
I'm stompin' on dangerous grounds, K in my hand
I ain't bout playin', call me the clean up man
Call me the clean up man, on dangerous grounds with the K off in my hand
