Snippets
And let the world spin 'round and 'round
No matter how it spin
No matter how it spin it won't break me down
Turnt
It's turnt, it's turnt, it's turnt, it's turnt, it's turnin' again
Turnt, turnt
It's turnt, it's turnt, it's turnt, it's turnin'
And let the world spin 'round and 'round
No matter how it spin it won't break me down
It's turnt, it's turnt, it's turnt, it's turnt, it's turnin' again

Standin' at the threshold of labor and dreams
Biology of science from a family of psychics
Raised by the pious in a town known for pirates
Survive the bias and the slander
Witnessed the riots, all for the anthem
Proud of the Panther, phantom operatic master
The fresh organic, orgasmic, rapture
Constant cosmic, soul sonic
Flow at all points of arrival and departure
Strong and strange and raise and set anchor
Poise over anger, wise before danger
Say a prayer for haters and their broken...
Keep it...

Turnt
