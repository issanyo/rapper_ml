(Verse 1)
B-bitches gonn love me, N-niggas gon' hate me
I don’t give a fuck, cause the bitches gon' take me
Everywhere I wanna go, everywhere I wanna be
Let a nigga penetrate, let me feel the ooh wee
Open up, backpack
30 thousand dollars in a Gucci backpack
Best time of my life
On Number 3 Michael Jordans tonight
Bitches can’t see me, turn on these lights
Watch my shoes nigga, we gonna fight (mmhhmm)
Drink, party, night, young
Weed, kill, sex, fun
Rudolph the red-nose white chick
I got everything you motherfucking like chick
Tony Montana, chillin' Tropicana black jeans, black shirt, black bandana, get 'em

(Hook)
Twerk that ass, twerk that ass, I fuck around and murk that ass, murk that ass, damn it
Twerk that ass, twerk that ass, I fuck around and murk that ass, murk that ass, damn it
Heal the world, what’s happening, what’s happening, ha?
What’s happening, what’s happening, nigga, ha
What’s happening, what’s happening, ha?

Late late, nigga I’ll hold her, full of that drank
Bout to get it goin'
Got 10 bad broads, 6 cold bitches
Even got my main broad playing with the strippers
Got a wife in Frisco, girl in Oakland
When we get together, then she get open
She kiss her then kiss me, Instagram, my family
I wish every real nigga had a million to blow
I wish every real bitch had a million in gold
I wish every fake nigga just leave the planet
And all these fake bitches, baby I can’t stand it

(Hook)

Obama to your mama nigga I’m that dude
If you don’t really like me nigga you should move
That’s my girl, nigga she the shit
Ballin' in this bitch with the best outfit
When we come, we come like an unit
Haters can’t stand it, me and baby girl doing it
Oh lord, swipe that card, whatever baby girl need, Fresh go hard

(Hook)
