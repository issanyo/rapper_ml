I got a trouble find bitches in the kitchen and they cooking it row
Realisting feams like stitches with the hooker in they chow
Fuck the law, man - I'm known for cooking it row
Til the cops just chill - I got something for y'all

Douth-South, Westside - man, I own my city
Got judges on my pay roll like they own the nigga
It's a professional with my game, I ball with the best
Birdman, Down-South - Mack 10 out West
Fuck with my money, put to put the mack to yo' chest
Want war? I take it there - or rather tattooed to there
See them Cash Money niggas - how can I iced like 'em
Cooking coke from the pill-up, it's got a prices like 'em
You know a nigga Whoopise - I got a wife like him
You heard a Micheal Jordan right! - I got a life like him
I'ma mothafuckin hustla - y'all know the game

Game is risky but a nigga rather died the fame
And live life - broken hungry out here, cracking for bread

It's a King Pin's Dream - coke and feminines
Belley's on triple beams, got scuffles with triple feams
So, busting out the scene - guns, scopes and beems
But the thing about it dream - it ain't all watta seem

[Mack 10]

Ohhh square ass nigga and full of brains are sold
I Know 'em Feds is on heat but I don't give a fuck

From crack, more then likey is a suggestion of sell
I gives a fuck - who ya breaking and disso skell
I live life like a King Pin weed but raw
I'm the richest gang living them niggas ever saw
I with ya belly from Toyota with the biggest and baking soda
Pirates po's full of peppers and crack folders
I'ma dope dealer - and I got coke scrilla
My whole crew can sit to at x-cons and killas
And my bitches is falls who bomb, head and coochie
Rockin props, the fades - the letto pump boochie
First statis, rock rolo - when I came to the door?
And now it's Bentleys, Mansions and meats to the floor
Kickin gears on Parley's, while the straight pipe screen
And I had a block on lock - since I was fifteen
Mack Sapranos - the most of unforgiven
And fuck a job, cause dope money is how I'm living
