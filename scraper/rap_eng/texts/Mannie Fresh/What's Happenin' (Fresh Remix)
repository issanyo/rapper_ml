[Verse 1: Juvenile]
We pull up in front the club and my rims was lookin nice
The subwoofers bumpin "(I Need It) In My Life"
We had a couple of fellas was stuntin' with they eyes
We jump out of the Lexus and got they mind right
See I ain't gotta rep cause they know I got chains
You can catch me in that ? boy, that money green thang
Get a fish and shrimp po'boy and go sit on St. James
I'm a playa like my ole boy that's where I get game
Hoes start passin' cause they want me to see 'em
Ain't givin' no action if they want some per diem'
I keep the soulja rag from the A.M. to the P.M
My heater in my lap lookin great up in the B-M
I know them niggas watchin' cause they know that I'm buck
But they can catch a hot one for fuckin' with a thug
Nothin' was poppin' so we went in the club
All the hoes started jockin' cause they knew who we was

[Hook: Juvenile (Mannie Fresh)]
Yes I'm thuggin'
Yes I'm clubbin'
I ain't trippin on you
Look, bitch, I'm buzzin'!
Hoes and niggas
I'm not lovin'
Fuck what you gettin if I ain't got nothin!
So what's happenin', what's happenin', (Uh-huh) what's happenin' with that
What's happenin', what's happenin', (Uh-huh) what's happenin' with that
What's happenin', what's happenin', (Uh-huh) what's happenin', what's happenin'
What's happenin', what's happenin', (Uh-huh) what's happenin' with that?

[Verse 2: B.G.]
You know how it get when B. Gizzle come around
The scene get off the chain, everybody be wildin' out
The Hot Boys buckin' and the Hot Girls too
This ain't nothin' new, this how New Orleans people do!
We get it how we live, we thuggin' to the fullest
You run up if you want and you gon' run into a bullet
The set keep bumpin', the DJ rockin'
The soldier is poppin' [?] Feds keep watchin'
We don't even trip, we just continue to slang
Continue to hang, continue to do our thang
It's do or get done, it's ball 'til you fall
If you a rider, you ride 'til the wheels fall off!
I'm a hustler, I hustle 'til the product's all gone
Real talk, you can catch me out there at six in the morn'
It's real out here, better duck if they bussin'
Never tellin' people nothin, in Chopper City we thuggin'!

[Hook: Juvenile (Mannie Fresh)]
Yes I'm thuggin'
Yes I'm clubbin'
I ain't trippin on you
Look, bitch, I'm buzzin'!
Hoes and niggas
I'm not lovin'
Fuck what you gettin if I ain't got nothin!
So what's happenin', what's happenin', (Uh-huh) what's happenin' with that
What's happenin', what's happenin', (Uh-huh) what's happenin' with that
What's happenin', what's happenin', (Uh-huh) what's happenin', what's happenin'
What's happenin', what's happenin', (Uh-huh) what's happenin' with that?

[Verse 3: Mannie Fresh]
See, the story takes place in the middle of the club
I was drunk as a muthafucka, reachin' for a drug
Drinkin' Cristal?  Nah, buddy, Grey Goose
Bouncin' to the bar and I'm 'bout to get loose
A tad bit of juice and a lil' bit of ice
That's the way I mix it 'cause I like my drinks right!
Then all of a sudden, niggas got to fussin'
Yellin' and screamin', pushin' and shovin'
An X man got 'em rollin', poppin' twos
That's why we can't have shit, 'cause niggas act a fool
A scuffle broke out, and shit got worse
I heard a rumble-dumble, and then some bottles burst!
And then somebody yelled, "Nigga, take it to the streets!"
I checked for my weapon and I gathered up my peeps
Arielle, Chanel, Letoya and Denise
Piled in a Bentley and we headed to the suites!

[Hook: Juvenile (Mannie Fresh)]
Yes I'm thuggin'
Yes I'm clubbin'
I ain't trippin on you
Look, bitch, I'm buzzin'!
Hoes and niggas
I'm not lovin'
Fuck what you gettin if I ain't got nothin!
So what's happenin', what's happenin', (Uh-huh) what's happenin' with that
What's happenin', what's happenin', (Uh-huh) what's happenin' with that
What's happenin', what's happenin', (Uh-huh) what's happenin', what's happenin'
What's happenin', what's happenin', (Uh-huh) what's happenin' with that?
