[First Verse-B.G.]
A nigga tried to test my nuts
Clown thought I was soft
Drumma had ten clicks
So you know I had to knock his head off
Caught him slipping on the darkside
Had to do a walk-by
Walked up on then popped him up
Watched that fuckin clown die
Bitch, Don't try to play me
Or you'll push up daisies
Baby Gangsta took you to war
Off wit yo head G
Don't ever underestimate
The 40 is off
Then you roll down for murder
And my game is cold
Situation bout this nigga
Make at a thousand plugs and slow
He shouldn't killed me for his dick
I'm gon' play him like a ho
The nigga deserved to be killed
Tried to play me like im not real
But I'mma pop a Red then chop ya
Yes, that cap got peeled
I had no motherfuckin love
Man I'm down to plug
'Cuz I'm a gangsta off Valence
A true fucken thug
