[Verse 1]
I'mma jalapeno boy, hot as Cayenne pepper
I'm from New Orleans City, but I’ll take her to wherever
I'm tougher than leather, I'm smoother than Suede
Always never broke, ‘cause I'm usually paid
Got the Rover with the cage kinda brown, off-beige
Everybody look at me, like I'm riding on stage
Gotta woman named Sage, she twice my age
Every time she hit me up she send a picture, with a page
I ain't tryin’ to fall in love, I ain't tryin’ get engaged
You can meet me at the alter when a nigga really dead
Every time I'm tryin’ to leave she beggin’ me to stay
And I politely fade away like my name was M.J
And she wrote me a note, guess what that note says?
Well, I hope you still like me but I go both ways
And then I say Oh, then I say Okay
Stabbed them up and got the fuck like my name was O.J
If you lookin’ for some money bitch my name is no way
Not tomorrow not today, not yes-terday
I'm Mr. President as they say
And that Phantom fits me like it’s tailor-made
I can take on a war, nigga bombs-away
I been in the water fucking all the Marmalades
If you lookin’ for some money, bitch my name is no way
Not tomorrow not today, not yes-terday

[Verse 2]
Last week I met a bitch, but I forgot her name
Short sweet, red cute, ole vibrant thang
She got a earring in her pussy, ‘n’ everywhere else
She said she jog everyday so she can cum on herself
Then she tell me my love is the best she's felt
And she sucked my dick like it’s about to melt
She drink Vitamin Water, say it’s good for her health
She can wrap my whole dick around her waist like a belt
Then there’s another bitch, her name was Ayesha
She ride that dick good and make a mean cheese pizza
One time it was so good, I told her to order one mo'
She said it’s not Domino's -- its DiGiorno's
There’s another bitch I met her at the Gong Show
Got her to the crib and turned it straight into a thong show
She do my dishes, wash my clothes and fix my corn rows
She do my dishes, wash my clothes and fix my corn rows
I can't forget about my bitch named Meaty-boo
She’s a young project bitch, I used to bring that hoe to school school
So I brung her to the school  we standing on the yard
The bitch asked me if I was from the 17th ward
Niggas came out the cut and started muggin’ me up
I grabbed the clip out my pocket and made them cowards duck
And I told my old lady "I’ll be back, you see" and hit me up on my cell phone
If niggas lookin’ for me, cause
