Brand new chopper with the scope
Ain’t playing with you niggas, I’m the GOAT
I’m the plug on the boat with the dope
Ain’t got time for these bitches no more
I’m the GOAT, I’m the GOAT
I’m the GOAT, I’m the GOAT
Brand new chopper with the scope
Ain’t playing with you niggas, I’m the GOAT

[Verse 1]
Talking Spanish with the plug on the metro
I got all these bitches boomin’, no Metro
Brand new chopper with the scope
Jay-Z, Kanye, I’m the GOAT
F-f-Fuckin' with bitch like Kylie
Got a chopper in the Rari, don’t try me
I was juuging and finessing on the boat
You ain’t getting to the money, you a joke
Louis V frames, got a hundred on me
I was in the trap, not a Maybach
Y’all just talkin’ ‘bout my face in the Forbes
A lot of rat bitches fucking on the floor
I am the greatest, mama I made it
Flexing in Hollywood and they hate it
I don’t really need no new friends
Met a bad bitch at the Ruth Chris
Givenchy and Louis, I’m dabbing some more
I came from kicking them doors
I’m flexing, I’m thanking the lord
I was just broke with my boys
Staring, you look at my diamonds
These rappers, they broke and they lying
In the club with a bottle of Moscato
I was MIA with a model

I’m the GOAT, I’m the GOAT

Brand new chopper with the scope

[Verse 2]
Brand new Rolex, still ain’t got the time for ti
I was on the interstate, do the dashboard
Pussy niggas they still hating on me
Check the top, nigga free Gucci
I know that you biting the flow
These rappers don’t like me no more
Went and bought a chain with my first check
I got out of jail, bought a new TEC
Sniper, sniper, it gon’ take you off
I was juuging, came up on the north
Gas, molly, used to trap the soft
Had to make it, but I took a loss
Bet you can’t do it like me
Got her on the Mike, now she geeked
I been counting money, can’t sleep
I done made 100k in one week
I’m the GOAT, pull up with a hammer
Magazines, I’ma fight in Atlanta
I’ma pick a bitch off of the runway
On the boat with Pablo like Kanye
Louis V, I’m supreme, on the coke
And she suck dick good, better choke
Hillary hit the dab, I’ma vote
I’m in white Chanel like the pope
