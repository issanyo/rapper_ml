I told y'all ass that I would be back
In a old school Fleetwood, big boned Cadillac
I told y'all ass that I would return
With a whole lotta motherfuckin' money to burn, mmmhmmm

I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
Fuck you, pussy boy!

And for the ladies, I'd like to break it down for y'all with doing some'n like this, ya heard?

She's the only one with the diamond in every toenail, hoooo
And she's got the Gucci boots with the Gs all around them
Break it down motherfucka!

I'm a Cash Money Millionaire, bitch
Two dollars from a motherfuckin' billionaire, bitch
Please motherfuckin' believe
I don't fuck up, I achieve
Yeah!
Ladies & Gentlemen
Boys & girls
Mammals, amphibians, reptiles and in between
And all that kinda shit
Dykes, fags, straight motherfuckers and all that
Please believe, right about now
You are being entertained, by the motherfuckin' greatest man alive
DJ Mannie Fresh
The motherfuckin' band is doin they motherfuckin' thing, please believe that
