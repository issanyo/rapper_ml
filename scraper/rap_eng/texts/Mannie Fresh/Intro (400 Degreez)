[Intro]
Woo, damn, damn, damn
Ladies and gentlemen
I'll say it once again
Ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to introduce to you, a young fella that goes by the name of Juvenile
Once again, his name is Juvenile
And he comes from that, Magnolia
Home of the soljas
Magnolia, home of the soljas
The dude that brung you "Put Up Your Solja Rag"
The one and only
And he's being assisted by Funky Fingers
The incredible Funky Fingers
And on the keys, murder after midnight
Woke, the one and only
And on the mic, right about this time
Let me do that once for you
They loving that
We 'bout to get to this album, ya dig?
That brand new Juvenile and it's called 400 Degreez
So, get your head short nappy
Put somethin' in it to make it happen, ya dig?
And we gon' get into this like this here
That's beautiful, that's beautiful, that's truly beautiful
That's truly beautiful, ya dig?
We got some head bustin' on here
Some wig splittin'
We even got some ballin' on it
It's a variety of stuff, ya dig?
So what we gon' do right now is turn the album over to Juvenile
