[Verse 1]
I take drama as far as it could go
I ain't no ho
That is something u would wanna know
I gets loose as a goose
When beef in my presence
I'm a hot boy fa'sho
Nigga a living legend
I straight creep if I get beef with ya
They got T-shirt waiting on yo fucking picture
Yo head leak like water drippin out a faucet
Cause I was in the hospital
Yo whoadie these niggas think I lost it
But I'm still a head busta
Run with straight real niggas
That's a fatigue nigga
So this the deal with ya
All about cash daddy
Face behind the mask daddy
Choppers with 50 in em'
Ready to blast daddy
Duck or get down nigga
Bounce or get bounced nigga
U on side of a milk carton
Can't be found nigga
Take it how u wanna
Bring it how u feel
Take in blood nigga you get it how u live

[Hook (Juvenile)]
