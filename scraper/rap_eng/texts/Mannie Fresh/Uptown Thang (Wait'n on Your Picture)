It's an uptown Thang nigga
From the 3 to the 13th

As I proceed to hit the muthafuckin' weed
I be givin' you exactly what you need
To bob your head, cuz I know you likes to bob it
Back and forward to what that nigga Fresh droppin'
Music that's non-stoppin'
P-poppin' for the hoes
Gangsta ass shit, for the nigga smokin' Optimos
You know we gets busy Uptown is the clique
Big Boy can't fuck wit us, cuz Ca$h Money is the shit

]From the Mac to the Melph to the Calio
Up in the Clara, V.L., the shit in between

Or six people will carry ya, niggas'll bury ya

Chorus:

And the clique I'm in with nigga 2-2-6

When I say Uptown brings it you experience
Commence upon the drama that I present clown
I'm uncomfortable, if in a town that's not Uptown
Get down with all that huntin', my trigga finga glad
To wrap around the K, and put some fire on that ass
My nigga Yella bad but Baby G. even worse
You ridin' in a hearse, if I grab and start clickin' first

Bang or get banged nigga it's an uptown thang

Chorus

Of the U.P.T., it's me, the Cash money B.G
Lettin' you know make it relate, fuck you up with the flows

So recognize, I keep it real, for my niggas
Most niggas who feel us is real Uptown niggas

Well keep ya head up or busta it's man slaughter

On tha real slip on tha banana peel get killed
Stop playin', before I start sprayin' I done told ya

So what's happenin'? I'm fuckin' wit that S.T.B
So what's happenin'? I'm fuckin' wit that 1-2-3

It's understood that I'll die for that wild 13
So keep it real, I'm chillin' wit that World War 2
Representin', I'm gone wit that 11th ward crew

To the end, I'm here to tell ya it's an Uptown thang
