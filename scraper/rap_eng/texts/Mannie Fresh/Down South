Yeahh.. scene so thick
Talkin bout OutKast, Organized, Rap-A-Lot
Nuttin but that U.G.K

All the hustlers
Eightball, MJG, Goodie Mob
Y'all know what it is

[Ludacris]
See I'm a Southern ass nigga with some Southern ass hoes
A hundred thou cash gets the Southern ass flow
I'm rich bitch no more runnin round cold
Or shootin up windows and gunnin down doors
Oh, yea I think the suckas now know
That the hummer got dropped keep it on the down low
I'm cruisin up highways, stunnin down roads
I'll open up shop then I'm shuttin down shows
Luda cash cheques that'll break the bank
Then I'm in the Old School like Frank the Tank
You can't beat me join me, petes they bore me
But all the Southern asses they keep me horny
Oooh, Big Tymers in a private jet
Got the head of Universal to sign the cheque
Meanwhile Ludacris is out arrangin rovers
Every coast watch out cuz the south's takin over
Uhh

[Lil Wayne]
Ay ay
Weezy the god bow down give praises
I'm easily involved with the drugs in my matrix
Just keepin it calm kickin dust from my laces
I'm puckin a dre in the escalade basic
Don't you fuckin play cuz I escapade faces
Buck fifty a gram quickly I'm real shifty
Come get me I'll be waitin the steel with me
Show appreciation for those who still with me
Throw a heap of gravy at those who still envy
Cuz Weezy f baby all gravy gotta feel me
Heh heh, feel me Lil' Weezy gat go blakah
Feel heat feel sleepy, here's your mattress
Chill, I'm still street deep, I got access
Young and play hard with no practice
Feelin me is like huggin a cactus
But if you know pain you take it love it and patch it

On any Southern beat got a bunch of Southern freaks
Buck naked outside neighbors callin police
Got a little Southern boy with a little Southern bike
Got a little Southern girlfriend that he'd like
Got a Southern ass truck with a Southern ass dog
Got a big big system knockin pictures off the wall
Got a big Southern party drivin big seven forty
