Shh, say Fabe, say Fabe
Look, Fresh done went to the bathroom
This your boy Weezy, baby, ya already know
He ain't want me rappin' on his album

'Cause I be talkin' bout that gun slangin', that murderin'
Them bitches, bitches havin' kids, bitches fuckin' bitches
Bitches fuckin' other bitches, bitches and the other bitch getting mad
And stab that bitch in the club and he gotta drag that bitch out

But look, he ain't want none on that on his album
He wanna write about lovin' and huggin' people
And hey lady, you look so fine
And I mean, you know, what I'm sayin'?

I ain't trying to downgrade nobody, nah nuttin' like that
But this nigga need some spittin' on here
So I can come on this motherfucker and flame it out
So somebody could cut this motherfucker on
He comin'? Cut my shit on

Yeah uhh, yeah uhh, yeah uhh, yeah Weezy F-Baby
Fresh, I tell him call me when its gangsta
Uhh, yeah uhh, yeah uhh, yeah, Birdman Jr
Fresh yeah, yeah, call me when it's gangsta man, yeah

I'm on fire, shorty so raw
I just may be Columbian, so I'm higher
Washed up niggas, I will tumble ya, double dry ya
I bubble gum and spit jambalaya

I'm fresh up out the kitchen with that Richard Pryor
Yeah, I keep your stomach rumble quiet
Holla, prior to me gettin' money, I was gettin' money
See, every time I hit a pen, I bungee like a spungee

I ain't playin' like Tony Dungy
Sayin' all ya'll is lunch meat to the hungry
Better watch your pot roast, when I'm on me
I'm nothin' nice, something like running through
A fill of blazing pistols with a fucking knife

I'm fresh to death, I need a fucking life
She say her man wrong, so she gonna fuck me right
I'm like fucking right, I got my two shooter
That mean I'm fucking twice

Bang, bang, woo, it was hard
Look at our journey, but I got here
I made it on the album people
It's Weezy, thank you Fresh

Look, Wayne, I told you bro'
No merkin', No murderin'
No bitches stabbin' bitches, no bullet wounds
None of that kinda shit

No fuckin' body with over 12 tattoos
And all that shit on this motherfuckin' album
This is some beautiful wholesome lovin' kind type stuff
If you can't go by them rules, get the fuck on dude

Now Fabe, play somethin' beautiful for the ladies
Somethin' that they're goin' to understand, let's get with it
