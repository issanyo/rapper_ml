[Verse 1]
They wonder why, bitty-bye bye, I do the shit I do, cause these muthafuckers always try to fade a fool
They make me 'Blocka Blocka' to all my enemies, you know straight hit the flizzo (Floor), hoe you gots to gizzo (go)
Cause ain't no way you can run, when I spit peels from my muthafucking steel, And ain't no way you can run, when I start
To feel that I gots to kill

[Hook]
You see I'm tired of being fucked with my nigga, gotta do my shit make sure it hit, gotta do my shit make sure it fuckin'
Hit, And fools never think Imma killer, til I start strapping up my shit, til a nigga start popping in them fucking clizzips (Clips)

[Verse 2]
Chillin' in the cut with my pistol packin' Bitch, bumping that muthafuckin' Pimp Daddy shit, A nigga keep a fat-sack of rock of yale
Gimme the sell, gimme the mail, so I can get paid swizz-el (Swell) We-zell (Well), And I was steady servin' mine on the block, some nigga
Rolled up on me try to hit for what I got, He said "Bitch don't flinch, or I'm dumpin' one false move and Imma break yo money hungry
Ass off something." I didn't breathe, cause I knew him and he knew me, tried to get my grip, but he was crazy for that ice and a G
Cause vengeance is a Muthafucka, and I ain't gon quit til' I get a bloody murder, strapped up my shit, me and my bitch, all on or lonely
Went to the crib and got my clips, because its on G, as my hoe was steady drivin', I'm thinking, Drinking, Smoking, Hoping I leave him
Stanking In a ditch-a, because he bitched up, now he gotta tossed up and buck, (?) He dont know whats up...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This Nigga was tripping, was telling my bitch but i ain't  bout it, she loading the clip up to handle that business and be out it, we get up
And nut up, to do the shit that we came to do, jumped out the ride and started busting at they whole crew, Cause ain't no way you can run, like
I told ya, when them cross a cut off soldier, warrior caught the busta twice in the area, of the chest guess he didn't plan to pack a vest

[Hook]

[Outro]
And get to the damage, as I manage, to blow ya brains out quicker than a candle....(Biatch!) as I dismantle, your brains...
See ain't no way you can run, from a nigga with the gun(x4) Blocka Blocka to all my enemies....
