[Verse 1: Webbie]
They say life like a casino, stay in school don't be no Gino
I tried but I was ridin' with my daddy and Bombino
Let daddy close your eyes, you know you don't wanna see no
Niggas you never seen 'fore tryna hit you like a free throw
Smokin' straight out the peezo, soakin' on sour diesel
You know I don't give a fuck, if it's up just let me know
I really live these savage ways, that's why I be feeling played
Lil niggas playin' with me, I got kids these niggas' age
And I really love 'em boy, and I'm really 'bout trouble boy
Fuck your pussy ass heart, then it's back to the bubbles boy
Never switch, I'm not a bitch, so faithful I married this
Savage life shit forever nigga, horses and carriages

[Chorus: Joeazzy]
Drop the top on my coupe, it's up with me
Twenty-four hour due, it's up with me
Christian Loub on my shoe, it's up with me
Every time I come through, it's up with me
I don't know about you but it's up with me, it's up with me
She ain't fuckin' with you, she fuck with me, she fuck with me
I don't know about you but it's up with me, it's up with me
She ain't fuckin' with you, she fuck with me, she fuck with me

[Verse 2: Joeazzy]
Put it on my wrist, on a brand new AP
The room on my neck, my shit look like 1980
Met her tonight and she already tryna save me
Bae I'm a dog, you ain't tryna catch my rabies
Pull up, hop out, panoramic roof Mercedes
Drippin' so much water, like I signed up for the Navy
Big racks in my pocket, your shit lookin' like Slim Shady
She say that pussy all mine, she hop on and ride me crazy
I don't know about you, I'ma drink my drink, I'ma smoke my weed
RIP to Pimp C, I drink codeine 'til I OD
Money weed and my sip, that's all I need, that's all I need
She ain't fuckin' with you, but she fuck with me, she fuck with me

[Chorus: Joeazzy]
Drop the top on my coupe, it's up with me
Twenty-four hour due, it's up with me
Christian Loub on my shoe, it's up with me
Every time I come through, it's up with me
I don't know about you but it's up with me, it's up with me
She ain't fuckin' with you, she fuck with me, she fuck with me
I don't know about you but it's up with me, it's up with me
She ain't fuckin' with you, she fuck with me, she fuck with me

[Verse 3: Bun B]
OG done linked back up with Webbie, now we back to this bread
Gettin' back to shakin' these haters and duckin' these feds
Got that gas, not that unleaded, smokin' that diesel
Get out of line and get your issue, that's you and your people
Might pull up in a foreign, might pull up in a truck
But either way I'm pullin' up and we ain't givin' a fuck
Ain't no talkin' down on the trill, we ain't with them games
We gon' come through whoopin' ass and we ain't takin' no names
Represent for my city, P-A-T, that's my town
We 'bout that money and power, we ain't messin' around
You come with flex and get down, ain't no time for no talkin'
You ain't rollin' how we rollin', bitch you best get to walkin', hold up

[Chorus: Joeazzy]
Drop the top on my coupe, it's up with me
Twenty-four hour due, it's up with me
Christian Loub on my shoe, it's up with me
Every time I come through, it's up with me
I don't know about you but it's up with me, it's up with me
She ain't fuckin' with you, she fuck with me, she fuck with me
I don't know about you but it's up with me, it's up with me
She ain't fuckin' with you, she fuck with me, she fuck with me
