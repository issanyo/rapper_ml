[Hook: Joi]
Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there
Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

[Verse 1: Birdman + Mannie Fresh]
Tell the sister like blood, little brother a thug
And how to survive the cracks in the middle of the mud
I'm the OG gangsta VL in the truth
Every nigga, in my city know how to tussle and shoot
My lil' homey got killed over a key and a pound
So when I pump, pump blood I'm a hold it down
His sister and his moms when I come around
Showin' love to the family when ya' lose your ground
Wassup lil' man had to write you a rap
Just to let you know this nigga, still got yo' back
Ain't too much change still doin' my shows
Stayin' away from fake niggas, and busta ass hoes
But enough about me and everything in my world
Congrats lil' dad heard you had a lil' girl
If theres anything they need and they ever in a jam
Don't hesitate to ask y'all call ya' Fam
Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Birdman + Mannie Fresh]
But can you see life roomin' with no crack and pipe
And no weed to smoke no Gs in sight
And no cris to bust no wheels on bikes
And no pussy to fuck nobody to like
But can you see life roomin' with no money and goods
Big money heavy weights with nobody to cook
Nobody to book nobody to look
Tryin' to get back what motherfuckers they took
All you see is that platinum shit
A ghetto nigga, on stage grabbin' his dick
But you don't know what I have seen
From the bitches to the riches, to the triple beams
The project bricks the old school kicks
The early mornin' capers and the late night flicks
But since I moved on things ain't the same
I chose rap you chose the game

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Birdman + Mannie Fresh]
Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there
See your mom still strugglin' you up in the pen
But mom just wonderin when the end gon end
When the guns gon stop from spinnin' the bin
Or when the hood gon block the dope in the pen
Or when the light shot out you up in the park
The white trunk out your homey got marked
Or every nigga, that talk or rat in his heart
Or every nigga, that talk should die in the dark
I never forgot you and what we did
And how we came up and where we lived
I'm seven forever turn coke to never
Hard head 'til I'm dead until I'm 'bout my cheddar
Gotta get my ends wanna push a Benz
Eat steak live great and raise my twins
I can't believe I'm talkin' to ya' now that ya' gone
I luv ya' bruh and this is my song

[Hook x 2:]
