[Talking] B.G
Uh-huh I'm bout my feddi by all means

Verse: 1
Look here I be on a paper chase I'm all about my cheddar
I ain't touching the mic if it ain't five Gs or better
I plan never to fall short again
I want game
Wootay I'ma tell ya no pain no gain
I hustle hard for what I want thats how I get it
I struggle hard and if its out there I'm goin get it
If ya see CMR a dollar sign on the CD
Somewhere on there you'll see featuring the B.G
Me and my nigga B like Suge and Pac
We gettin' our shine on all the way to the top
Look ain't no stoppin' us boy don't try
When you hear it once it ain't no secret you go and buy
You can lie bout this stunt bout that
You can't dodge these fifty shots I'm bout ta rat-tat-tat
Ain't nothin change still a busta wig splitter
Straight hustle for my chesse I'ma money go-getter

[Hook] 2x
Bout my paper my chesse so before my eyes close
I want my green ta add up ta six zeros
Get yo fetti nigga somebody playa hate split'em
Get yo fetti nigga somebody stop you kill'em

[Verse 2]
Its all about Benjamins thats all I wanna have
Ducked off in my house with a ho takin' a bubble bath
Sparklin' marble coverin' all my room floors
A maid in a bathin' suit doin' my house chores
Do not disturb sign on my bedroom door
Cuz my dick gettin' ate by my number one whore
Look I'm money hungry
Bout actin' a donkey
No longer a junkie
I got rid of that monkey
I'm cheeky I don't want you fuckin' with my shit
My neck and my knuckles covered with crushed out shit
Sparklin' gold cover my muthafuckin' grill
Pockets filled with big head hundred dollar bills
Fuckin' up this rap game with these wicked rap skills
And ain't far from makin' Gs ta makin' mills
I'm a treal B.G. uptown hard hitter
On the real my nigga I'ma money go-getter

(Chorus) 2x

[Verse 3]
Oh I gotta get it gotta grab it
Gotta have it
Like snortin' dope but snortin' coke is a habit
I gotta see it gotta feel it
Quick ta spin it
Shoot dice all day with my niggas tryin' ta win it
I rap hustle cuz I'm a hustlin' ass nigga
Also a gat totter bout bustin' some ass nigga
So you, can play with me bout my chesse
You gotta go fool in a casket six feet deep
Sellin' tapes and CDs
Like sellin' pick threes
Ring up a million sales we done hit the lottery
I'm a benjamin chaser
Playa hata eraser
Police have no case
Cuz I do murders without a trace
I'm almost at home I done past third base
I'm playin' with five figures when I get six I'm straight
If I catch yo bitch down bad I'ma hit her
Paper chaser nigga B.G. a money go-getter

[Hook] x2
