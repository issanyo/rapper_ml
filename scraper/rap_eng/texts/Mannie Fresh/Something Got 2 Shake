[Verse 1: Juvenile]
I put my trust in myself and my 9 first
Y'all niggas second, third, and fourth because I'm first
Can't you tell I never had nothin'
Down to my last 5 dollars, ready to snatch somethin'
If them people catch me I'm goin' to jail fo' sho'
My old lady ain't gon' be sendin' me no mail no mo'
While I be askin' my lawyers, "When they gon' let me go?"
He be tellin' me, "Just be cool until you go to court"
Get out, back to the bricks, it's the same old shit
Niggas got 2.50 a piece goin' half on a nick
Back and forth to keys, but the Lil Weezy handle purchase
Popeye's for the ballers, the ghetto eatin' Church's
Shop always open cause nobody never closes
Some of 'em like that needle, some play with they noses
I ain't nothin' like a candlelight dinner, wine and roses
Niggas tryin' to run through they packets to get some mo' shit

[Chorus: Manny Fresh]
Somethin' gotta shke nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga
Run with all the real niggas
Jack all of the fake niggas
Somethin' gotta shke nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga
Run with all the real niggas
Jack all of the fake niggas
Somethin' gotta shke nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga
Run with all the real niggas
Jack all of the fake niggas
Somethin' gotta shke nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga
Run with all the real niggas
Jack all of the fake niggas

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
My hallways full of piss
Nigga say he gon' break me off, he full of shit
That's why I got that chopper in the back full of clips
About to go and hit a whole stash full of bricks
All my niggas gone, I'm the last in the click
I gotta get my hands on some cash and a whip
I gotta do somethin', look
Cause this ain't gonna last long, gotta get my cash on
Come upon a superfire lick and get my ass home
Ain't thinkin' about jumpin' out Lex's and Benzes
With the TV's, and the CD's, and 20 inch 'renzes
Look here, my situation ain't the best in the world
I'm a snake like the rest of you niggas, full of that Guerl
Wodie, c'mon and get your skull cracked, tryin' to erase me
I got iron ready to warbat, and it's all for safety
Muthafucka might come, but he better come correct
Cause I ain't aimin' at nothin' else but you' head and yo' chest

[Chorus: Manny Fresh]
Somethin' gotta shke nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga
Run with all the real niggas
Jack all of the fake niggas
Somethin' gotta shke nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga
Run with all the real niggas
Jack all of the fake niggas
Somethin' gotta shke nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga
Run with all the real niggas
Jack all of the fake niggas
Somethin' gotta shke nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga
Run with all the real niggas
Jack all of the fake niggas

[Vesre 3: Baby]
Put a hit on a bitch, ain't got no time for no bullshit
Nigga outta line, we kill'd the bitch
Now, in my city, they burn, baby burn
4 found dead, and they burn, baby burn
I don't have no question, we all must learn
To tote a .45, keep your eyes on the churn
I got that work nigga, all y'all know the rules
I don't play, I'm a mastermind, it's a Big Tymer, fool
Pay up when you been fronted work, that's the rule
Rolls parked, I play this game with no law
Red Beam, hot ones pointed straight to your jaw
A nigga must pay, I'm tryin' to see a better day
Went to Miami bought that Azora anyway
Three time loser totin' tools, nigga that's the rules
Just the chance I gotta take on these streets fool
Flippin' chickens, corner spitin', hardtimes a fool

[Chorus: Manny Fresh]
Somethin' gotta shke nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga
Run with all the real niggas
Jack all of the fake niggas
Somethin' gotta shke nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga
Run with all the real niggas
Jack all of the fake niggas
Somethin' gotta shke nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga
Run with all the real niggas
Jack all of the fake niggas
Run with all the real niggas
Jack all of the fake niggas
Somethin' gotta shke nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga
Run with all the real niggas
Jack all of the fake niggas
Somethin' gotta shke nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga
Run with all the real niggas
Jack all of the fake niggas

[Outro: Manny Fresh]
Somethin' gotta shake nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga
Run with all the real niggas
Click-Clack all of the fake niggas
Lay it down
