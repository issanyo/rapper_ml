[Intro - Mannie Fresh (Chamillionaire):]
Ladies and gentlemen (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
The most beautiful girl in the world pagan (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Brought to you by (Yeah) (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Frankie J (Yeah) (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(chamillitairy mayne) and Mannie F-f-f-f-fresh
(Hold up, let's go)

[Chamillionaire:]
My swagger's like a dagger
I want it, I can have her
I pop up and I grab her like abracadabra
Body's picture perfect like she's shaking it for my camera
She introduce Frankie while he moving forward and catch her

[Frankie J:]
Everybody knows when I step in the club (club)
Girls see me and they wanna show me love (love)
I got my chain on, with my shades on
Rocking designer shoes and I sold a million
So many girls, but there's one that caught my eye (eye)
Pretty lady so fine she blew my mind
Oh why
Cause she's the one for me

[Hook - Frankie J, Mannie Fresh:]
I've been around the world
And seen so many girls
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
She got a bill and a face like a supermodel
And a body built just like a Coke bottle
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
Shake it [6X] Snap
Shake it [5X] bring it back
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl

[Frankie J:]
I think she knows that I'm tryna get at her
I'mma go ahead and try to put in words
What's your name, what's your number, can I hit you up?
If you digging what I'm saying
Let me know what's up
So baby let me know if I can take you home (take you home)
I just wanna be somewhere where we're alone, alone
Cause you're the one for me

[Hook - Frankie J, Mannie Fresh:]
I've been around the world (around the world)
And seen so many girls (so many girls)
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
She got a bill and a face like a supermodel
And a body built just like a coke bottle
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl (none can compare, she's that girl)
Shake it [6X] Snap
Shake it [5X] bring it back
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl

[Mannie Fresh says "Snap" in background]
Welcome to Miami
I've seen so many mammies
Over seas, the girls I've seen
But none compare to you baby
I've been around the world and back
And never seen a girl like that
Now it's clear to me that you're that girl for me

[Chamillionaire:]
And then she looks at me
And then she says "if I ever had breakfast in bed"
Then I say "I'd rather have breakfast in Brazil instead"
Then she says "Stop playing, why you're messing with my head?"
Then I say "I'm not playing, I got a jet and we can check it"

Yes I had you try find an energizer battery
Keep gone, she know she'll be sweating, loosing calories
You can be the best "B" I bet you couldn't handle me
With money on the bed and I can prove it on my salary

[Hook - Frankie J, Mannie Fresh:]
She got a bill and a face like a supermodel
And a body built just like a coke bottle
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
Shake it [6X] Snap
Come on, come on, come on, come on baby
Shake it [5X] bring it back
Come on, come on, come on, come on you're so sexy
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
Shake it [6X] Snap
The way your body moves
Shake it [5X] bring it back
I love your sexy attitude
But none can compare
Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl

[Scratch]
That girl
[Scratch]
That girl
