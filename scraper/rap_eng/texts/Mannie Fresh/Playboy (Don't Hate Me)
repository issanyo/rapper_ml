[Lil Wayne]

I be comin with it
If spot Wayne from a distance in the Expedition
I'm on chrome 20 inches
You'd know who I be
Oh yes you'd know me
Hoes see millionaire that's h-o-t
Wodie slow down you might be ahead
To slip and tell all your broads we already
Corleone me a mobsta regular
And you can call me on my ce-elier (cellular)
(What) Celebrate and pop the Dom-P (beep)
That's me that drive the Hum-Vee (uh-uh)
Me and Lil Travis
Stuntin' hard lord bless my daddy Rabbit
I got a rolley on my wrist with ten karats
And I'm a shine but I'm still about blastin' (huh)
Nigga lil shorty bout paper
Bedroom, second floor and elevator
I'm a superstar (star)
Money makin' pimp
Up in the double-R (R)
Just me and Slim
I'm gettin cheese by the mills stackin' cake boy
Cash Money how you love that playboy, playboy

Don't hate me baby cause I'm beautiful

[Bun B]

We go lights, action, camera
We here to hammer ya
Go ask Pamela or your baby mama lil Tamera
Feel like a samera or Zorro rich niggas don't barrow
Fill a check and wait 'til the bank open tomarrow
Look at your sorrow
Heads gotta meet
Kids gotta eat
Why don't we make a mil (million)
Rhymin' in and out of beat
In mydazeep(???)
Shit don't even look for it it's way off
Concerts sellin' out like Chicago Bull's playoffs
So stay off the ground cuz it's dangerous wodie
Too many riches these bitches gonna wanna hang with us
Wodie
It's a gang of us wodie
You see one everywhere you go
Ain't no thing with this wodie
You get it any ear for sure
We go to the bank
So much bitch we got a bedroom
What else count money and give a nigga head room
So when you hear the leg boom
Bitch you better get somewhere
Somebody gettin' hit somewhere
But on the west start some shit somewhere

[Baby]

I got these niggas talkin' bout this black on black
Hummer

But this year playboy I'm a stretch that motherfucker
I bought a Yukon for my main bitch with my new horn
Pictures of other niggas' old ladies suckin' my shit
While you be lovin' this stupid bitch
Now I guess since I been playin' with about 10 mil or 'sum
These bitches givin' me their pussy like it ain't nothin'
Goin' to the club with 10 G's
And the bar tab that's all on Baby
Lettin' these hoes and niggas drink for free
Playgirl but you gotta understand 1 thing
That shit all on Cash Money
Well here's another case of this ho sprayin' mace in my face
Cause I wouldn't give this ho no play
Tellin' me I think my shit don't stink
Cause I got a Benz, a Hummer, a Lexus
And a penthouse that say "ho hater"
With tattos with number 1 stunter
With billionaire on my left arm
And millionaire on my right arm
Bitches be lovin' this gold grill homey
I spent 20 G's on my earrings homey
Nigga I ain't met a nigga that can drop a beat like
Fresh
And I ain't met a nigga tha can out shine me
See I got a clip that's called "pussy go-getters"
Now playboy these hoes be lovin' these Cash Money
Niggas
