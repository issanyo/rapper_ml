Get out the way now, hey.. get out the way now..
Get out the way now, headbusters on the way now.. ahh, ahh
Get out the way now, the headbusters on the way now.. mmm
Get out the way.. get out the way now..

You wonder why I don't smile and don't make friends
Or ki-ki with new niggas; cause I don't know dem
I didn't shoot marbles witcha and you ain't no kin
Kissin ass like you be doin look you ain't no men
The only reason you're talkin crazy cause you drank mo' gin
You can take it there if you want, look you ain't gon' win
And I'm feelin like an example is needed to be made
I'mma take this calico and go bust me a head
They might just won't retailate, they might just be afraid
Some niggas I been fuckin with controllin what they say
It's still on! They wouldn't let me ride
That was they nigga that we killed so one of us gotta die
Oh yeah, they wanna play ha?
Must really be underestimatin me and this 'k ha?
It must not be meant for you so please get out the way now
I'm one of the best doin this, bout every day now.. hah..

[Hook: repeat 2X]
I'm warnin ya, I'm tellin ya
A HeadBusta is up in ya area
Don't stand there better be bailin brah
Or hollow tip bullets gonna tear you up

I wonder how long it's gon' take 'fore niggas realize I'm not a game
Look at me nigga, you think I'm playin?
Do it look like everything in my life goin correctly?
Bitch, I'mma be bout it 'til the man come get me
I got a fucked up conscience, and my thinkin ain't right
I got a brand new child but look I'mma slanger tonight
Nigga swellin up his chest, cause I'm bangin his wife
I'm at the bar drinkin Hennessy, he came with a knife
I got my man on the side of me, he scopin him right
He think it's over but he gonna get fucked over tonight
If I got problem witcha I'mma address it, front and center
If we beef in January, won't be until December
I'm tryin to getcha outta here
Like your momma and your lawyer, stuck with four or five open charges
Dealin with you bitches like you're one of my children
Whippin your ass because you left out the buildin

Fuck with a G ain't gon' never stop
Somebody gotta go - you better have the better plot
Cause if not, little shit could escalate to big shit
One of your little man'sll be the one pay you a visit
Enticed by them neighbors, they gave him a picture
Twenty G's, some toolies, now he comin to getcha
Wodie my life is like a football field
He done crossed the line of scrimmage is the one I kill, and I feel
That the marker should be first and goal
And I got the ball of course, goin in to sco' - nigga
What's my motherfuckin name? Wodie it don't matter
What's the shit up in my hand? A piece of chrome manner
And I just had me a blunt, and a cup of that gin
Don't get scared now motherfucker you in trouble my friend
