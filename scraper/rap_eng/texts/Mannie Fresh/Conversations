Hey there shorty, looking kind of good
With your Guicci frames on, girl represent ya hood

[Tateeze]
Hey how you doing
You kind of cute too
Snuggling like cool water in your pinacle boots

[Mannie Fresh]
See I keep my hair cut and get my nails done
And everybody know my name, baby, where I'm from
See they treat me like the mayor
Some say that I'm a player
I'm a high noon, tycoon, sexy-lady slayer

[Tateeze]
Damn, dude please
I'm all about the cheese
You push your old school
I jangle Mercedes keys
Your bad credit having ass need to be ashamed
With everything in your momma's name
Everybody know

[Mannie Fresh]
Now I'm gonna tell the truth, we ain't got to fuss
I don't own a car, pimping ride the bus
But you looking mighty good (Yeah I am kind of hot)
Girl we can get it on (Boy go on and do the wop)

Whop with it, whop da whop with it whop with it
Whop with it, whop da whop with it whop with it
Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang Ba Bang
Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang Ba Bang

[Tateeze]
Work something Twirk something get it girl
Work something Twirk something get it girl
Rock with it and look back at it, I said
Roll with it and look back at it

[Mannie Fresh]
You say you doing good, but you could be better
Roll with a pimp, number one trend setter
Your man is a cream puff (Boy you don't know him)
Well do he buy you nice stuff? (Shut up, you still growin)
Enough about him, let's talk about us
(Take your time shorty) baby I ain't in a rush
Slow motion with it, if you let me hit it
I get you right every night and put the ocean in it
I gotta postapedic heart-shaped water bed
The sheets might be satin and the pillows look suede
Yea girl I know how to getcha
I gotta 54 inch flat screen picture
Of me standing by a tree
With some khaki diki's on in the white tee mmhmm
And I like the way you move (I like the way you step)
We can get it goin' (Well go on and do the prep)

Prep with it, Prep da Prep with it, Prep with it
Prep with it, Right to Left with it, Prep with it

Go on break it down, show'em what you working with
Go on break it down shake it like an earthquake

[Tateeze]
Smurf with it, Smurf da Smurf with it, Jerk with it
Smurf with it, Smurf da Smurf with it, Work with it

Now do the soul clap, Now do tha soul clap
Now do the soul clap, Now do tha soul clap

[Mannie Fresh]
The club is packed, the night is young
Come here baby girl I'm tryin' to make you the one
You the one, one, one, one, one, one
Put your finger in the air if you having fun, girlfriend
Now I......I...da da da da...I......
Been looking at you from across the spot
My legs start shaking and my body get hot
I need relations
Can't fight the temptations
[Well this is just conversation]
[Ain't gonna be no penetration]
Now wait a minute, hold up, baby get it straight
I ain't gotta be your man, we don't even got to date
But we almost at the end of the song
The club about to close, let a player bring you home

Shorty drop it like it's hot, pick it up and make it pop
Now go down to the floor, take your time work it slow

[Tateeze]
Keep it right there daddy, I'm going to bounce that
When you want it, how you want it, make it bounce back

[Mannie Fresh]
C'mon and back it up, back da back it up (oh)
Back it up, Back da back it up (oh)

[Tateeze]
C'mon and rock with it and look back at it, I said
Roll with it and look back at it, c'mon

[Mannie Fresh]
Now slide and do the waterfall
Now slide and let the rain come down
Slide and do the waterfall
Now slide and let the rain come down

Get some, get some, get some
