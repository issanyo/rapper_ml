[Spoken: BG]
Oh it's on now, still on now
Ain't nothin changed, we still on chrome lil daddy
And in the same place

[BG]
Washington and Ferret on Sunday, they buck, jumpin
We on 17's stuntin', the second lines comin'
The hot girls ow, the Hot Boys loud
We in top of the line cars uptown boys, wow
For 17, ridin flier than ya daddy
Play a different car everyday, ya daddy in the Caddy
The F-E-Ds smashed me
Picture they thought they had me
BG shinin so hard that they tryin to harrass me
But they let me go, cause we way ahead, smarter
Keys come from overseas in a submarine under water
Still 'gon ride the Legend Monday, ride the Lex Tuesday
Ride the Benz Wednesday
Under the seat is the uzi
Ride the Camaro Thursday, F150 Friday, Saturday
50 shots to set it off for bustas tryin to carjack me
Sunday only 'gon wash my tone up wit my girl sippin wine home
All week I gotta get my shine on

[Hook]
Get your shine on, get your shine on
All day long, I'mma get mine on
Get your shine on, get your shine on
The haters need to know the world is my own (2x)

[Baby]
Now all these cars and all these broads
Playa, I'm bout to get my shine on
Now I'm in Club Whispers wit a $10,000 bar tap
Bitches think I'm jokin, stupid ??? in my lap
I'm bout to drink some Domm P. fo' I leave this here
And take another broad on V.L. to do this year
Now every car I ride in got chrome on it homie
Got a mouth full of gold, to show Uptown soul
Plug hoes
And make more money independently than a major nigga done went gold
I got a million dollar gang wit a 2 million dollar mouthpiece
And quick to lil freak on these satin silk sheets
Now playa, Rufus Playin in the Lexus, Gangsta got a Q-5
If anyone of you broads know Baby know I like to ride fly
BG got a F-1-5-Oh, Mannie Fresh got a Suburban on mo-moes
Now me Baby, a big body Benz
Expedition, my black cat and my Hummer my friend
Now I could change a car for everyday of the week
And have TVs for that matchin broad in the passenger seat
Eleven hundred Gs stashed away for my son
So when he grow up he can have a lil fun
I'm still sellin keys, stackin Gs on the D.L
I stashed a million under the barber shop on V.L
Now I ain't no rapper
Playa, I'm a game spitter
Ten Gs a show
That's the only way you 'gon see Baby at a concert ya know

[Hook]

[Mannie Fresh]
Now do ya have more riches
Than the sea got fishes
Can you do more broads, than the Feds got snitches
See, I ride Lexus land wit the TV playin
Gettin head, shake a Fed with a phone in my hand
See a playa 'gon shine, what you see, it's mines
Rolexes, went to Texas, Motorola, Alpine
Woodgrain, Hummer, hoodrat dumber
Hot Boys got toys, number one stunners
I know you piss-ants can't stand me
Lexus wit da candy
Blowin on blunts, sippin on Brandy
Now that's a good call
Papa cleaner than ya ever saw
929 wit the mirror bro
Tint it up, juice and Gin it up, send it up
To Texas, get the syrup wit the lean, bend it up
Ball 'til I fall, that's the job playa
Cash Money, Hot Boy, number one rhyme sayer

[Hook]

[BG]
I like to look good, be shy, on my side keep my nine on
Playa haters wanna spill ya when ya get your shine on
But none of that, I'mma get mine on chrome
On the 929 wit my Primeco phone on
I'm a Hot Boy, hot girls I put the bone on
It ain't no secret, I'll bust ya dome homes
B and Slim give me a 20 G loan
So I could get my roll on
I know my rounds ain't gone tell me hold on
They let me write the Cash Money check, they sign it
I cash it, I spend it
It's all good, we ride fly
Benz, Lex, Expedition
No doing bad, fulfillin dreams and wishes
Payin all my girls school tuition
If I'm in a shootout, I got the red beam, I ain't missin
Face the ballistics, we got it like dat, we earned it liked dat
Worked for it like dat, so we could shine like dat
Get my shine on 7 days a week
After the click blew, I just pooped up in the F150
Cash Money brothas, we brothas like no other
Click thicker than peanut-butter
We shined this summer
