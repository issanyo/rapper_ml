[Intro: B.G.]
I don't play
Shit real nigga
It's cut throat, you gotta play it raw

[Verse 1: Turk]
Gettin' killed, ain't no thang, in the N.O
Some people live, some people get smoked
Life trap, get crossed up by them dog hoes
Like shit, get masked out over dog hoes
Really doe
Bullet holes be so big
Innocent bystanders get hit, even little kids
Niggas be lookin', like they at a shootin' range
Don't give a fuck who they hittin', they just do they thang
Bullets be coastin' like birds in a flock
Hit yo block with camouflage nigga gone get got
A hundred shots flippin', you can get away
Gettin' chopped, losin' they life, by the A.K
Everyday, niggas at war, niggas dyin'
That's yo ass if you don't have it on yo waist line
Kickin' in doors, playin' by no rules realah
Like B.G. whatever you do its all on you realah

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
It musta been meant for me ta be rich
If only my dead niggas could of lived to see this
I appreciate what the lord gave to me
But I don't appreciate is how these niggas be hatin' me
What is it? is it the car? is it the jewels?
Is it the shoes?
Or do you want to see what a nigga gone do?
I know a nigga plottin' up ta jack me or nab me
Thats why when I ride on my lap be the strap piece
Don't try ta jam me one tha one-way dawg
Look, cus you ain't gettin' away without no gunplay fall
You gone be in a hospital a.k.a. we never close
In a morgue with a tag on yo toes
Believe this, fuck with me I ain't gone let it go
I'm a preach this, up until the moment I'm no more
I followed my first rhyme, cus ain't no second chance of life
These lil niggas outchea bussin' heads for stripes
Bullshit, I ain't for it, so get cha some business
I'm a hurt one of you bitches
Let the lord be my witness

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
What yall don't know
Lil Wayne the nigga from Holly Grove
Quick ta strap up and ride play the blunt and lets go
What yall niggas thank Wayne ain't bad
Lil' baby boy thuggin' tote a K foe sag
I be up in all black, behind the ski mask
Outside ya complex duckin', waitin' ta blast
I'll kick yo ass if too many questions
And I'll catch a nigga cut with two S.K.s
Yall fake like two large silicon breasts
What you forgot? head bussers leave bloody messes
I leave dreadlocks in ya tennis
Duck, boys better lay it down when I'm spittin'
Put it like this, in the primetime of the night you can try ta come in
But cha can't go and split it, ha ha, get it
Better watch and ya mentionin', fluid ya mouth
Better rearrange ya system
Yall niggas want beef look, and what?
Me and Lil' Tolie in tha fire, lettin' tha cash buck
So what ya scared now, ha, punk leave tha street
Beat cha meat
Do sum'n get from 'round me
Lil shy you really thank its a game bruh
Let me show ya when them Hot Boys play tha game raw

[Verse 4: B.G]
Ya got some keys, I come ta duct tape ya and rope ya, stay low
My chopper gone let loose and super soak ya, fa sho
I gets low down and dirty for my cheese, ya know
B.G. roll with 'bout it H.B.s, we strapped
Get flipped up around and get kidnapped, where its at
Don't bring me to a bukah you'll get capped, it's like that
I won't mine just like you want yurn
I gotta get my shine on cus I feel like it's my turn
Fuck a bitch, my money is way more important
I'm behind tha tints
On a mission tryin' ta get it
And I won't stop, 'til I got it all in one pile
The got a hit over a nigga head for fifteen thou
I'm goin' out, to tha house, where he lay at
I'm gon' prawl, around the club where he play at, I'm a get with him
Split him, put his heart in a jar
Go get his bitch from the bar
Collect my money from the boss
I play it raw nigga

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
