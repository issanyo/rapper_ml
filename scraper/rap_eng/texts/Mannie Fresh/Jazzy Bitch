[Verse One: Lil Ya]
I can never run out of bitches to write about it
My forget they name but I got game
That's how I get them out
I told ya bout Demetrice, Evet, and Sabrina
Never gave you the low on this stank hoe
Katrina I seen her, walkin' out the Melph by herself
She's a bad bitch from Uptown who lived in the Melph
I introduced myself it's the capital Y-A
OK? She asked me what I like to drink
I told her Alaza and by the way
You need to pick up some of that foolishness
It makes me hard, when I start I don't want to quit
Man I punished this hoe, I wore the pussy out and
Before I left, best believe I got them out
I told you I'm a gangster and I just
Don't quit so I'm a talk some more shit bout
Another bitch I got partna out the three we call
Him Tee, now me and my nigga Tee was fuckin' the same
Bitch named Nicky, Nicky was the Spanish type of bitch
Who liked the sex, she was down for havin' sex
But I was in it for her checks
She lived near the Nell, I told the bitch to give me some mail
She took me to dinner, broke me off I ended up in her
Now, Yella Boy you my nigga I know you don't trip
But after the chorus won't ya brag for a bitch

[Hook: Lil Ya]
LIl' Ya got a gangsta jazzy bitch

But we lookin' for them bitches with them

{2x}

[Verse 2: Yella Boy]
My story starts about my baby mama
Mother Fuck ya, I wish I never met ya
Keep my name off ya, Bam-Mouse!
I can shake it, cuz I caught ya loose
I'm sick of tired of the right's to left's and
The uppercuts I had to throw
Now I'm goin' solo hoe
Ya see, I want a popper from the South
So she work her mouth, plus my long dick
Make her scream and shout
Now where the big booty bitches who can really bounce
Stroke it up at the Teli or at my house
I like to tear them hoes up when I'm full of
That dope, servin' up with the dick down they throat
Like Scope, I'm come through like a gun at the head
Hold the noise, let's get busy fuck the jeep check
I'm down with dackaree go down the pussy
Dizzy, now tell me do you feel the heat in yo stomach dizzy
Break it off for the record let my boy's hit it
Fuck a nice, I want a real freaky bitch
Cuz I'm a gee runnin' game catch the M O Four
To be with me you got to be low down and dirty hoe
Pussy way Uptown cuz I'm a clown
Turnin' you bitches smile into a frown
Undercover freak I brought ya self-sex out
Skeet skeet from yo hip to yo titte hoe
I want the whole nine yard's plus yo heart hoe
I want ya to back the fuck up
Take a step back hoe
It's the fella with the chuck's
Comin' to rip wrap up them bitches
On the floor with the hoe bro
You see me in the mall spendin' what the fuck I want hoe
All XL Polo's with Beaucoup thirty six waist Girbauds

Chorus: {2x}

[Verse 3: Tec-9]
From the nine-five to the nine-six
I switched around my life
Last night I fucked Kangol's wife
It's like over and over
We twerk it on up
Got to keep my eye's on these bitches
Out for my riches
They need they hair fixed and start to schemenin'
Them dirty hoes
Tec-9 what ya like? I like a pretty little bitch
Tec-9 what ya like? I like a fine ass bitch
Tec-9 what ya like? Well as a matter of fact I like a bitch
Who ain't afraid to suck the bozack
My bitches is trippin' , got a mind full of silly games
It's such a shame I had to diss the hoe
Now I'll be solo now picture me
Pimpin' a flock of hoes got 'em workin' on the streets
And I'm at home gettin' my dicked sucked up
Under the sheets I stroke the pussy
To left I stroke the pussy to the right
Hot blowed, I'm releasin'' down yo throat
It's four thirty in the mornin' got to make it home
Before my wife wakes up and know she sleep alone
It's the same rotation as I apply the penetration
To yo body, I'm smokin' I'm fatty the moment is right
You call me daddy, it's like over and over
You twerk it on up but we lookin' for
Them bitches with the real big butts
Now the sweat from your forehead is
Drippin' in my chest no fakin' no more
Because you know you dealin' with the best
You want a key to my pad, but you tweekin'
You try'na find a way to straight trap me

[Hook: 2x]
