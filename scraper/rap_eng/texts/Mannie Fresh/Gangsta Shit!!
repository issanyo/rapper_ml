My shit ain't water without 7 g's bout a bird
Play hard and get that serve
You know for sure that you heard
I bring noise, hanging out back with big toys
I give props to my world
What you want on your tombstone
Your pathetic boy, oh it's on in the dirty south
You can't afford hitting your dome in his own
Hang up and bitch you fuckin with a hot boy
Of the 13th, down the street of the U.P.T. it's B.G
Record company CMB
Thugs wanna come up and see
Da magnolia, the mel boys
CP3, I warned you, we're outlaws
You can't see me
I come without a stummer
The drivers think I'm done
I'm second to none
Get full of them blunts
My cliq got glocs and macks with beams on em
The big man got jacket with my team on em
You get it, I'll get with em and split em
Yeah, I did em, we done em, I'mma go uptown and rum em

Bitch me, my whole town nigga
Get that fake frown out your mouth or get pound nigga
I'm a hound
I hunt niggas down quietly
Smash a potato on my knee and you pass quietly
A young gangsta spank ya off the top
Left you to hang the crop without all props
Do you ever hear
That nigga is a fool
One with me, twos I use, you lose
Killas I hang wit
We feel smart now
You ain't shit
Trying to get wit me, you see me
No nigga can do it
Fuck wit me on the streets, man no nigga can do it
I get low down a dirty
Off with ya head, ol dirty
All my nuts anger, put it in the Benz
Till elevated tanger
I'mma switin west hanger
Crack slanger, neck splitted
Kool Aid gripper
I'm here to deal wit cha, I can't forget cha
If you beefin, then I'm creepin on ya
Watch your back cuz, I'll put that streetsweeper on ya
If you gonna bust back, you better ask out
I'll leave you flat, when the bullets start grasp
