[Mannie Fresh]
Yo red necks, coloreds, asians, africans, ethiopians
Whatever you is-it's ya boy Freshly Snipes ya heard
With Young Flip and I call this one....

[Chorus - Mannie + Flip]
[Now what it do]
Yeah nigga got too much loot
[Now what it do]
Yeah baby push the GT Coupe
[Now what it do]
Yeah nigga showin platinum tooth's
Aye play with me homey let the ego shoot
[Now what it do]
Yeah baby Young Flipper is back(I'm back!)
[Now what it do]
Yeah nigga candy Cadillacs
[Now what it do]
Pump your backs it's just too much glass
I still rep Cloverland-Know what is y'all sayin?

[Verse 1 - Flip]
You know ya baby mama wanna ride with a G
Cause she shakin her ass to this Mannie Fresh beat
I'm fly as a muhfucker-high as a muhfucker
4 rolled diamond chain, iced out belt buckle
Aye and I'm still on the grind
I own 10 watches but I'm never on time
I show up late-cause I blow up weight
You doin shows down here but you can't go upstate
Now what it do I'm tryna leave with you and you
I'm twenty-deep, I ain't trippin bring ya crew
I got my heat you packin little 22's
We Clover G's the home of lean and Dj Screw

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Flip]
Aye I got the big home, the whip chrome
The king back you can't take my throne(hell naw)
I been chillin on the low gettin dough fuh sho
Run up on me thirty shots(blat-blat)but I'm lettin e'm go
You can't fuck with my team I'm just lettin you know
If it cost five-hundred that's regular dro
Cops pull a nigga over cause they jealous of my car
My OZ's twelve-hundred you can smell it through the jar
Grab a sweet roll it up(coughing)get the drank pour it up
And no you can't come with me if you ain't old enough
You know that Desert Eagle come with a holster
But my GT ain't come with a showfer(Damn!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Flip]
Aye the dope boy say I'm shinin'boy
But that shit came from grindin boy
Yellow diamonds every where like I stuck up Johnny
Dogg I heard ya paper low I got that stuck up money
Shut the fuck up dummy you ain't hard as us
I went to France and found out you ain't large as us
I get paid just to come to the club and chill
I let ya chick braid my hair-plus she love my grill
Fuck a house on a hill, cause my shit by the lake
I'm like Jigga I can do this in one-take
We got wieght, we got dro, we got all the guns
Ask about Lil' Flip you know where I'm from

[Chorus]

[Lil' Flip]
Yeah aye that's how we do it man
Y'all niggas need to step ya game up man
Clover G's in the motherfuckin building
Dogg BG Duke in the building, D-Redd in the building
Will-Lean the chemist in the building
The black Al Capone in the building
UA Deal in the building, Mid West in the motherfuckin building
And we doin it so, so motherfuckin big
Big Shasta in the building, M Dollar in the building
We gettin money nigga and when you see me in the streets say "what it do"
And don't call me Flip no motherfuckin more call me Flipperachi...
Hahaha and we out!
