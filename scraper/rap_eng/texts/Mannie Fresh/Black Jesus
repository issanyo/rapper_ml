Let the choir sing

Everywhere we go
People wanna know
Who we are
So we tell them

[Verse 1]
A big beat with a bass
Arrangement each piece in its place
BK, NOLA, The Boogieman and The Go DJ
Good God, a yes y'all
I work it out, make it run, lift it off
Fly. I'm like a dove from up above
And when I rock they say, "That's my one!"
"That's my one!" Yeah "That's my one!"
"That's my one!", "That's my one!"
"That's my one!", I turn it up bump it up
And when it feel good to you it's good for real
And when it's real baby that's how it's how it's supposed to feel
Testify

[Hook]
