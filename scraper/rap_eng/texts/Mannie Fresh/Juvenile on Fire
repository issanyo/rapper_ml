[Verse 1]
Let's say I'm in a room with a bitch and the ho don't wan' fuck
Like a man I'ma beat my meat and get my fuckin' nut - fa'sho'
She gonna be drove then
And I'ma cut the TV off and go to sleep on that ho then
Now tell that to your girlfriend, you tell her everything else
She gon' to be with her boyfriend, you gon' to be by your damn self
While I'm in my Benz with your friend
And she bout to get nervous
Baby, I don't want nothing but some mouth and lip service
Don't act bad, don't get mad
That's all I can do with you, cause I don't want your ass
Look you kinda fine with a nigga name on your spine
Now respect my fuckin' mind how I'ma hit that from behind
Got a ho across the court
And my lil' boo stay next door
I'm getting tired of you heifers
It's time for me to restore
I done fixed these bitches house up
And have them living swell
But yet and still a nigga like me was eating at Taco Bell
But after that shit
All that trick shit I stopped it
And lock my fuckin' pockets
You can't pick it or pop it
Now I get what I can get
Out of these hoes and I'm up
And if she wanna flex up
I'ma beat the ho up

[Chorus]
Girl, that's Juvenile
You don't know he on fire
Seventeen-inch Momos
Black Magic on his tires
Girl, that's Juvenile
You don't know he on fire
Seventeen-inch Momos
Black Magic on his tires
Girl, that's Juvenile
You don't know he on fire
Seventeen-inch Momos
Black Magic on his tires
Girl, that's Juvenile
You don't know he on fire
Seventeen-inch Momos
Black Magic on his tires

[Verse 2]
See I know how to treat a ho
Just talk and greet a ho
Let her know I don't need a ho
Don't mix up your people ho
If I tell you do something
You better do what I say
If you planning on playing me
Better get out my way
A bitch will get you killed
That's the way I think
From some ol' bitch ass nigga
Trying to receive my bank
Pussy come and it go
It been like that before I got here
Pussy don't wait for me or no nigga
But its gone stop here
For a little while
So I'ma get what I could
And if she bout sucking some dick
I ain't hating its all good
Now can I get that out you
It ain't hard to do
You'se a fine motherfucker
And it starts with you
I'm trying to fuck something till it can't see
What I'ma show you with this dick
You gon' thank me
A nigga gon' be like that until the moment I retire
Now ask them bitches 'bout me
They gone say that I'm on fire

[Chorus]
Girl, that's Juvenile
You don't know he on fire
Seventeen-inch Momos
Black Magic on his tires
Girl, that's Juvenile
You don't know he on fire
Seventeen-inch Momos
Black Magic on his tires
Girl, that's Juvenile
You don't know he on fire
Seventeen-inch Momos
Black Magic on his tires
Girl, that's Juvenile
You don't know he on fire
Seventeen-inch Momos
Black Magic on his tires

[Verse 3]
If I even fuck with a bitch
She gonna know
Not to conversate with niggas
And to open my door
My business is my business
It ain't to be heard
My niggas is my niggas
So you don't say a word
And you don't touch my shit
You don't drive my shit
I got dope in the house
And I hide my shit
I got bad nerves
I hope you don't try my shit
Do right and nice things I'ma buy my bitch
Some bitches you gotta play'em with a long string
You play them close
And they gon' be thinking wrong things
You got something that I hear you don't wanna bring
You not a muthafuckin' player you a punk man
Let me get one of them hoes up on this dope dick
Stop handcuffing that bitch let her approach this
You know when Juvenile comes he has to smoke shit
I'm on fire, on fire
And you know this

[Chorus]
Girl, that's Juvenile
You don't know he on fire
Seventeen-inch Momos
Black Magic on his tires
Girl, that's Juvenile
You don't know he on fire
Seventeen-inch Momos
Black Magic on his tires
Girl, that's Juvenile
You don't know he on fire
Seventeen-inch Momos
Black Magic on his tires
Girl, that's Juvenile
You don't know he on fire
Seventeen-inch Momos
Black Magic on his tires

[Outro]

You can fuck my bitch
Let me fuck your bitch
