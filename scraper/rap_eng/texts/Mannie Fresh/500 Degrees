(Feltz - Verse 1)

500 degrees mudda-fuckers were hot
You want the green shot, better know i got the dot
Started at the bottom, gunna reach the top
Tryna reach a belly, but they want to see me flop

I just laugh when they talk about i
I just laugh cos there bullshits a lie
Im fucking fly, I'm fucking high
Jumbo jet swag in the fuking sky

If you see me cruising on the bike
With the one glove then i got the knife
Cos the haters are on a hype
Get caps knocked of like i open sprite

You can see me grinding up all night
Try'na build up my line
Don't like my shit thats fine
Try move to me stab spine

(tyga - Hook)

(Feltz - Verse 2)

Ha ha I'm on my funky shit
Dont test me ill let it rip
White boy mad strip
Even fat boys will bang it

See me rolling with my goons
Heaters out like its winter
Your bitch she wants to spoon
Then I'm putting something in her

Rest in peace god knows I'm a sinner
Ill eat you make me a dinner
Your baby mum wants the middle finger
Doggy that bitch in the ringer (doggy that bitch in the ringer)

She be belling me she says she wants to link
I said I'm with my boy thats pink and stink
Ha ha ha ha
She said baby i wanna drink

I don't drink have you lost your mind
She's telling me that she's mine
I was like are you out of your mind
Bitch you can't keep up with my grind

Me I'm on my straight stacks
Got the 9 bar in the rucksack
On the pushbike heading to the trap
BFB put the town on the map

(Tyga - Hook)

Bitch I'm all you need

(Feltz - Verse 3)

Augh don't get me mad
Pussyboy your not bad
Talking like you've got swag
Your get put in a plastic bag

Smoke weed yolo

Let me switch it up mento
I get head from your sis broooo

You know how we roll
You know that we ball
No we ain't no fool
Told the bitch go find a pole

Getting a lap dance
Snapback trapstar
Reload full bar
Back to the ends half bar

Chop it up in quarters
Im a chelsea supporter
Im a striker drogba
Screaming fuck the coppers

So what you know about the flow
You say you cake but you ain't got dough
I'm still hot even in the snow
I ain't on raves but you know i glow

Thinking about when we do shows
Getting all that p.o
Free cd's, free throws
SWIR thats the team bro

And were all about the dough
I don't give a shit about a ho
She be snorting on the coke
But F3LTZYY's all about the notes. (Bitch)
