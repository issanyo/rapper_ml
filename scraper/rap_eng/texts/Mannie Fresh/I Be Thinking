[B.G.]
I live rough - I done had enough of doin' bad
If I can recall, all my life, I've been on my ass
Unlock a bitch, and his wards are the graveyard
And in my ward, you can't help but to come apart
And all my boys got beef on the fuckin' block
And they draw heat from them niggas, plus we duckin' cops
I try to clock 'cause that's all I know and slingin'
But I got my Glock 'cause ain't no hangin' there if you ain't bangin'
Gunshots be ringin', but I bump and bust 'til I let 'em know
I ain't no ho, and I ain't 'bout to start bein' no ho
I smoke herb tryin' to calm my motherfuckin' nerves
But I'm stressed, and so (???)'ll leave ya on the curb
I asked a nigga that I know to front a quarter bird
But I smoked dope again - he said that's what he heard
Now that's jeopardizin', that nigga brains blown away
Niggas playa-hatin' - What kinda shit is that to say?
Fuckin'-up my pay, better get a nigga straight (??)
In a hurry
I'll have your mommy black eyes blurry
You better worry if you're dippin' your nose in mine
Got these hoes in line, now these niggas gotta get in line
I can't mind dyin', where I'm from, I live by the iron
On the block of Valence and Magnolia, it's hard times

(Hook [B.G.])
I be loaded, thinkin' of Range Rovers
Maybe I could get a Range Rover if I stay my ass sober
I be loaded, thinkin' of condos
Now, maybe I could get a condo if I keep my nose closed

I be loaded, thinkin' of Range Rovers
Maybe I could get a Range Rover if I stay my ass sober
I be loaded, thinkin' of condos
Maybe I could get a condo if I keep my nose closed

I be loaded, thinkin' of Range Rovers
Maybe I could get a Range Rover if I stay my ass sober

[B.G.]
I want it - I'm pickin' your lock, comin' through blastin'
Gotta feed the animal - this bitch gots to have it
Where I'm from, there's no jive and you must be a survivor
Niggas ain't relyin' on no nine-to-fiver
Ruckus, beef, the ghetto is all I know
Hunger, no feast is all a young nigga know
Blow, get tore down, get a stressed nigga through
And this K will slow you down - any vest it will go through
My hood is tainted-up, it's full of pollution
Snortin' was last year - now a motherfucker shootin'
Stickin' they arm up, not givin' a fuck
Tryin' to jack the armored truck, not givin' a fuck
Around my way, it's a residential project
We all thuggin', so just look around and see who die next
Man, I'm out the Melph - What am I supposed to do?
Stand alone, gotta watch these niggas close to you
I'm rappin', now I'm makin' money - I can't duck my niggas
Get vacated, don't come around to say fuck my niggas (Enough of that)
The same niggas that'll drown in that water for me
Slow down, and'll spank a nigga daughter for me
We still clique - everything you break, you can't fix
We caught up in the mix, but V.L. still the shit
I represent mine in every motherfuckin' rhyme
You can't stop crimes 'cause Uptown is hard times

(Hook [B.G.])
I be loaded, thinkin' of Range Rovers
Maybe I could get a Range Rover if I stay my ass sober
I be loaded, thinkin' of condos
Now, maybe I could still live in a condo if I keep my nose closed

I be loaded, thinkin' of Range Rovers
Maybe I could get a Range Rover if I stay my ass sober
I be loaded, thinkin' of condos
Maybe I could get a condo if I keep my nose closed

[B.G.]
That heroin hit my block; opened it like a earthquake
Niggas graduatin' on they fifteenth birthday
Some snortin', and some spikin' it
That shit be cut heavy, and them niggas still be likin' it
That (???), that shit is still sweet
But you gon' get your money's worth in that Saint T
Or on Philip and C., or atop that CP3
But the B.G....workin' on kickin' that D
Now, can I...collect my gain? Stack my change?
Can I...maintain and do this rap thing?
Yo, can I...kick it?

[Mannie Fresh]
Yes, you can

[B.G.]
Well, I'm gon' kick it - You bitches understand?
I'ma get my n's deep and...buy me a truck
Get high, get up instead of walkin' with that duck
I'ma let mine hang - let the Desert Eagle sing
Let it be known all over, it's a Uptown thang
Fulfill my wishes...with my hand on my nine
Push that big Expedition and get through hard times, nigga

(Hook-3x [B.G.])
I be loaded, thinkin' of Range Rovers
Maybe I could get a Range Rover if I stay my ass sober
I be loaded, thinkin' of condos
Maybe I could get a condo if I keep my nose closed

[Mannie Fresh (talking)]
Keep your nose closed, ya heard me (ya heard me, ya heard me)
Off top (Off top, Off top)
