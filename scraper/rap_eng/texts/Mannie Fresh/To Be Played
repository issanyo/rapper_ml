Ran out of smoke ass
Gay ass, oh

Old sissy ass wannabe

Some of these niggas are bitches too
Look at yourself

But that's the way they do it bro

Switch, twitch

Fake ass snitch
You need more people
We don't believe you
Fuck you in your ass
You can never be my equal

(Baby)
I ain't the one
To get played like a pool party
Trick money
Get nothing bitch
Get the fuck
Give me something for my money, ma
You know the score
Long dick, big pimps
Got to get more
Get dough, off tha dro
With the cash flow
Laid low
Fo' deep on the indo
? ? ?
That's how we roll
Ay yo how we roll on them 24's
On tha block
With the rocks, with the Calico
New whip, new shoes on the benzo
New ?kick? drop bricks in the 6 4
New lift, got chicks and they all know

How we ride
How we slide
How we get inside
How we hustle
How we grind
Til the day we die
How we muscle
How we tussle
It's the way of life
You don't see my struggle
All you see is fuckin ?

To get cracked at a dice game
Roll seven hit eleven
Get your money, man
Get together pluck a feather
Wear your gold chain
OG young nigga
Let me do my thing
Came through in the Rolls with the full frame
Zaratoga and ? ? with the dope game
Early 70's
The block ? had a name
Grey haired Mr Johnny is a pimp thing

(Mannie)
I ain't the one
Piss me off
And I'm a get the gun
Clear this motherfucker out
And make them all run
They shoot
Too late to look
Blocka, Blocka, Blocka, Blocka, Blocka, Bla
?7 wall hard head?
Kill them all
I want them dead
Watch your mouth
It's a drought
And they all afraid
The feds got ?flicks?
Of all your clicks
They confiscating cars and they locking up chicks
