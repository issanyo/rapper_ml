Baby gangsta got an A.K
With 50 shots for that ass
We play it raw on V.L
If you lame you can't last
No hesitation in my trigger finger to blast
Any false move will leave a nigga on their back
Wodie I'm young but strictly bout my cash
Fuck petty check I want it in thousand dollar stacks
I'm a nigga that's on the grind for six figures
I'm a chilla but bring me out my bad I'm always splita
You kill me it really don't matter to Lil B. Geezy
It's cool whoa I'm waitin' to see my nigga L.Teezy
No bullshittin' I fuck bitches by the pack
Hoes be wishin' to watch t.v's in the Expedition
Me and Lil Wayne keep it real like we supposed to
It's a few niggas in Carrollton that I get close to
Any other I put a slug above their shoulder
It ain't no secret I represent uptown soldiers

[Lil Wayne]

Now I be gettin' down and dirty from the U.P.T
Nigga try to test-bless his soul, he rest in peace
You mess with me and you will see how messy it be
Lil Wayne hat tipped Dickies fall to my feet
I done wet a lot of places
The same nigga that be jumpin' out suitcases
Yes I pull up in my Compresser (Mmm-hmm)
You seen me earlier in the Lexus
That's how we do it
What, got something against me and my cash money brothers
Yeah I floss but niggas know that I'm a young head buster
I come to tear this mother...Don't say that
I keep it real like a man, Ms Citha don't play that
What's happenin' Shipa (???)
Hot Boy gangsta rap writer
Alright you cool when you spit but my beats tighter
My nigga Fresh come with tracks that'll move you
He hit you with the *erre-check-erre-check* One-Two
(Ha Ha)
Now wait what where my guns at
Where all my niggas who ready to bust back
Now check this look:
I don't think you niggas ripped ever what I can bring
20 or 30 bullets close range to your frame
This h-o-t-b-o-y-u-p-t be where I'm found
*inhales* Smoke on a pound and come to tear your
Neighborhood down
Look here neggey you think you really ready?
No, I hit make 'em sick like a *choghs* bad cold
Lil Doogey and I ride the 4 by 4 shh
Nigga I'm too fast you can't slow my roll What

[Mannie Fresh]

Whoa Kemosabe, Big ballin is my hobby
2 bitches in the room 2 bitches in the lobby
Baby what!? Tear this motherfucker up
You don't want it in your mouth put it in your butt
Breathe it up like town
I represent down
7 ward nigga with a mean-mug frown
Knock a bitch out, then wake a bitch up
Then knock a bitch out again
Y'all pick the bitch up
I ask a bitch like Mia
How the fuck you gonna see a
Bad ass mad ass captain bitch beater (MMMM)
What's the difference between me and your pipes
Please, 20 G's you dick suckin' morphodites
I got the brand new car the Downtown Superstar
Saint Bernard to DeVille nigga you know who I are
Project pecker, scatter site wrecker
Comin' out your 'Bauds hoes y'all wait a second
How the fuck you gonna kill this
These bitches love the willist (realist)
Ask your pa who the man (Mannie in old man's voice)
I ain't gonna lie, he the realist

[Lil Wayne]
