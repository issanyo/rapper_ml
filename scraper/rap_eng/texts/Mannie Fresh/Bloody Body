[Verse 1: Tec-9]
Nigga watch out, cuz here I come ready to bust your dome
The capital, T-E-C, from the three
I know you know me
You best to pray, if I decide to stay, overnight in your bushes
What about three of my pushers?
With Tec-9, he splits vines
Don't want to face the bounty hunter comin' at'cha from the Uptown area
Ready to bury ya
Don't want to be no victim of the clique
So I shoot first, I'm spittin' but I still got hit
But my condition is not worser than that nigga
He's nothin' but a bloody body, a bloody body
Plus I got the Black Connection standin' right beside me
And now the rest of your clique has got to deal
With the pistol-packin', Black Connection branch start Uptown
Ready to take 'em down, ready to take 'em down
Bitches ask me what will I be doin' tonight
I tell them bitches that I got a session with the mic
Parle' is cool and okay, but I'd rather chill and hustle
I break it to 'em easy, fit the pieces to the puzzle
I'm always on a come up, don't run up, don't make me put my gun up
The master, bitch nigga blaster
Top dollar makes me aim for the collar
Better watch me because I'm comin', you know I'm comin'

[Verse 2: B.G.]
It's, it's, it's the nigga with the black suit ready to mug
Off it nigga or get plugged, cuz I spit seventeen slugs
I'ma steal when I'm on a creep, ready to bust
Full of that dope, don't give a fuck, I run up on ya get stuck
I'll off a priest nigga, niggas who got it, off that yay, I'ma rape up
Yella I'ma rope 'em
(Lil' Doogie I'ma tape 'em)
Nigga call your people tell'em I want fifteen
If they don't bring it I'ma put your bitch ass in that Gangsta lean
If you play hard then they gone find you in the trunk straight foul
Cuz you got done up by that Black Connection juvenile
I'ma straight mug ya
Thirteenth Ward thugsta
Disrespect me I'll put you in check, then I'm gone bust ya
You know what's happenin', I'm a hustla
Turn you into crusta
Dust ya, disgust ya, straight unplug ya
Slug ya up bitch with the hollow points to your chest
You wanna be greedy, stingy, put your ass to rest
B.G., put your ass six feet nigga
Over some yay, you done met my fuckin' heat nigga
Put to sleep nigga, best believe I creep nigga
In a hooptie me and my boys four deep nigga
Two if you got it, I told you already to hide it
Cuz I'm comin', and I'll do anything tryin' to find it
I'm on a come up, livin' good is the reason
That I get mail all year round, it's duct tape season
So strap up, cuz I'ma close shop when I pop
And I don't tear down one house I tear down the whole block
So get your shit together, do what'cha gotta do
Cuz the muthafuckin' B.G. is comin' through nigga

[Verse 3: Yella Boy]
Just who's the one mad at me?
Watch the bloody tragedy
I shoulda, woulda, coulda, would've knocked ya in the headdress G, Right go get the black glove, ready to put in work
Hope you had the witness spilled, if not then you'z a jerk
I'm steady thinkin' devious, my thoughts about drama
Fill you with the hollows then go straight to the Bahamas
The snipers on your scalp and I'm a killa so I snatch it
Bailey's and St. Ide's on every Sunday that's my habit
Gonna get you bringin' the blues, if you wanna get somewhere
Got'z the top of the line Rugers, bout to make your skin tear
Cuz I don't care, and you feel the effects of this affair
Down for war, nothin's funny like Fozzie Bear, I'ma dump ya nigga
Cremators gone, fingertips, rest is bone
Ambulance on the way, cuz the day I plead is half gone
My clique consists of niggas that rap or bust back
And who conference down, black on black
Duck here come the chucks and Skips and chips Like Van Dyke
Over yo' feet it's over "G"
