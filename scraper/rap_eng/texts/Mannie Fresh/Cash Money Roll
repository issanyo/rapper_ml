(Baby of BigTymer$)
Nigga we don't drop albums, we drop classics

[Verse 1]
I ain't even gotta tell you how Cash Money Roll
I ain't even gotta tell  you we ballin outta control
Cause  it be shows all seven days of the week
Top of the line rides flying up and down the street
Any kind of car C.M.B boys could claim it
Lexus's, Benz's, & Trucks, MotorBikes you name it
Rolly all the time gotta get my shine on
Right here got the nine & in my left the PrimeCo Phone
Rap dues I done paid it
I'm on a level that these niggas Can't fade it
Nigga I been hustlin since twelve I done made it
Rappin off nuthin but Mannie (Mannie Fresh) Beats
He the greatest, but wait hold up, you ain't heard the latest
Million dollar contract a 150 pages, Not minimum
We makin maximum wages
Let me tell u about bayou classic how we played it
We hit Canal (Canal Street) so deep click  so strong
Every vehicle we rode in was on chrome
The Hummer sound had em' jumpin in the SuperDome
We got so much money we gave the bank a credit loan
We go shopping and spend 50 G's at the mall
But that don't hurt cause Cash Money gone still ball
Nigga Until We Fall

[Hook]2x
I ain't even gotta tell u how Cash Money Roll!
I ain't even gotta tell u we ballin outta control!

[Verse 2]
I'm a baller, drive cars with big rims
Leather seats, sound bumpin all in your ears
The dress code:  t-shirts, Ree's (Reebok Soldiers) & Bauds (Girbauds)
It's 98,  my money stack  it don't  fold
I'm a livin legend, havin fire weed sessions
Hide your bitch cause I will have in my possession
I'm top notch, it ain't no secret I'm hot
You can spot,  my Rolex watch from down the block
I don't talk shit if I ain't  able to prove it
My wrist spark bitch, Especially in the dark bitch
I'm a young nigga, tru 2 da game nigga
Far from dumb And play'n with a little change nigga
Fuck with me I put a little over your brain nigga
But fuck that I ride and let my chopper rang nigga
Since 97' I got a lil bigger and taller
Chasing 6 figures, I'm the Cash Money Baller

[Hook]x3

[Verse 3]
Say B (Baby), I heard Cap had another baby
It's a lil girl, pop the bottle let's celebrate
It's your second it's all good lay it down nigga
You ho drove mutha fuckem lay it down nigga
You know I got a lil HotGirl to be
That's my world dawg she lookin just like me
I'm straight out all the old money from my old habit
I'm spendin' that on ear rings with 10 karats
I got my lil girl a Lexus for when she grow up
I flying from Tennessee to Texas trying to blow up
I need 10 G's a show for me to show up
And six weeks for me and my clique to post up
We shining, wearing Rolex's that winding
Stacking money for days Nigga, big tyming
Fucking hoes, shot callin, and ballin
Keepin it real, with my back against the wall'n

[Hook]
