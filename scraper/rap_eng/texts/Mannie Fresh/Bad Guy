Call me Duby Montana, Don Corleone
When all the shit ain't going right, I'm who they're calling on
And you may hustle like I do, but shit, I'm fast with it
All the money you have it I'm a wipe my ass with it
I'm quite as good as fuck, I have the grant to it
You ain't able, but your momma had to sign for it
I got a lot of flavor, the one I'm sizing up
Juven deliver and sometimes feel like tisa hot
Blood shed when is a problem with them down the size
My niggas enter in your houses like the power lines
I'm good, homie, I put my father on it
My pain while I get hot they're getting the water on it
I'm the bad guy, everything and all black
And you ain't gotta say, bitch, I think I'm all it
I'm too gee, man, I gotta get two keys
You want me to show off for the show as they call the two keys
So say hello to the bad guy
I'm a better nigga but I'm still a mad fly
They say I'm ruthless, I'm just trying to stay alive
So when you see me say hello to the bad guy
I'm the bad guy, homie, I'm the bad guy
So when you see me say hello to the bad guy
I'm the bad guy, nigga, I'm the bad guy
So when you see me say hello to the bad guy
I'm the bad guy, the one they always blame it on
I'm tired to work these other niggas ballet hanging on
My credit cards are master p, ain't no limit to 'em
I've car bushing and I put it, quit the finish to 'em
I love beef shit, I eat it with my baked potato
Live by the gorge and keep the gee, is gonna be greater later
Juvenile needle, I'm a real goodie
I'm hard born, but I'm calling a Portalbelle pussy
I don't play that, me and my road dogs
Get 'em up in as I chop the tip of your nose off
I'm real about the money, nigga, no flaws
Mercedes cooper, my speakers' knocking my doors off
So say hello to the bad guy
I'm a better nigga but I'm still a mad fly
They say I'm ruthless, I'm just trying to stay alive
So when you see me say hello to the bad guy
I'm the bad guy, homie, I'm the bad guy
So when you see me say hello to the bad guy
I'm the bad guy, nigga, I'm the bad guy
So when you see me say hello to the bad guy
You want a television ship, but you're a fall guy
Back to the top 'cause it ain't hard
These niggas' fake up in a motherfucker, swear to God
I'm hating and I'm here to see you motherfucker starve
Bitches know who you is, you don't wanna set the charge
You gonna inspect my pants, you know how I wanna this
I'm a looking on a biscuit on that money train, that is a thing
They say I'm jail break, that even make a case
Niggas be talking about prison like that's a better place
Nobody with me anymore, I'm a forgotten homie
They're only riding on me, feel like they flying on me
So say hello to the bad guy
I'm a better nigga but I'm still a mad fly
They say I'm ruthless, I'm just trying to stay alive
So when you see me say hello to the bad guy
I'm the bad guy, homie, I'm the bad guy
So when you see me say hello to the bad guy
I'm the bad guy, nigga, I'm the bad guy
So when you see me say hello to the bad guy
