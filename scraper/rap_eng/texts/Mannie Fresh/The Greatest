[Verse 1]
Diamonds in my bracelet shine like a Kodak flash
Just motivation for these freaky hoes to show that ass nigga
I pop tags on a throwback fast
Nigga please, I'm wearin' these when I cut my grass... freeze
All you niggas wanna touch my cash
The 40 cal's in the stash, and when I touch I blast
Televison's in the dash, suede roof in the coupe
I'm the one nigga, young niggas knew is the truth
And the dumb niggas I ain't done provin' it to
Come with a clique of guerillas like I hung at a zoo
I gotta bitch to pull bitches like she one of the crew
Now a buncha broads in the back bustin' it loose
Do it free for me and charge you a hundred or two
Top floor in the presidential with a wonderful view
Yeah I'm rich, but I ain't just talkin' I live like this
You couldn't get water out the faucet as clear as my wrist

[Hook] {​Mannie Fresh & TIP}​
Pimpin' y'all ain't heard that latest?
Ay it's the best of the best
Young pimpin' on a record with Fresh
I drive Chevys, fuck Mercedes
Hopped out the new CL V12, got in the blue SS
And I'm leavin' witcha ladies
I got a beautiful bitch, pursuin' ya bitch
Next thing ya know, ya losin' ya bitch, pimp
Yall niggas give it up I'm the greatest
Ay, I'm the greatest, ay, I'm the greatest, ay
Pimpin' I'm the greatest

[Verse 2]
It's been a long time since you seen a nigga like me
In a pair of Gucci sneakers, jeans and a white tee
Extravagant and outa control, I might be
But I'm makin' 50k on the road a night G
Rocks in my ring, big as cubes in ya ice tea
I used to dream 'bout a Benz now I own like 3
I gotta wine-colored V, with the wine-colored V
And reclined leather seats, I ain't lyin' on my beats
You can tell I'm gettin' money how I shine in the streets
Blowin' on the best pine you can find in the streets
Rappers wastin' they time if they trying to compete
They records sales declinin' when mine hit the streets
I got the fine freaks starin', 'cus my time piece glarin'
When the light hit the carrats, got they eyes lookin' Chinese
You'll run yourself raggedy tryna out shine me
No matter whatcha do, you're 2 steps behind me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
A smooth attitude enable me to ball outrageous
Nigga fuck you pay me, I'm all outa favors
What Grand Hustle got ain't a motherfucker gave us
A motherfuckin' thing, but ain't a motherfucker played us
You gotta mil' that's a small percentage
The way ya record deal structured, you only get a small percentage
I gotta Magnum with a magnum in it
Playstation and a plasma in it
Sittin' on 20 inches and it's tinted
Gotta hemi nothin' faster than it
The 50 Gs'll pass you in it, get real
Gotta Chevy more expensive than that Jag you rented
Excuse me, but let Young Pimpin' brag a minute
Gotta bottle of Louie and a flock of groupies hotter than Rudy
Lickin' me dry when I get out the jacuzzi
They eatin' pussy, suckin' dick until they mouth got gooey
Can't another young nigga in the south outdo me

[Hook]
