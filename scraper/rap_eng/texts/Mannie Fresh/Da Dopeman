[Intro]
Look at this little nigga, man
Ay T.I. is that really you man?
Yeah shawty, what's happenin'?
Ay man can you give me a ride home, man?
Man, it's 2:30 in the muthafuckin' mornin', what the fuck you doin' out here?
Out here trappin' tryna get rid of this bomb and purp, man
Man you can come with me on one condition
What's that bruh?
Let me convince you to put that bomb down
I knew it T.I
What?
You wasn't really on that dope boy shit
I tell you what shawty, get in man

I'll show you how to tote that tool
Make that double
Better be cool, you don't want no trouble
Keep it leanin' to the left
My gat stay cocked
I'm always super clean when you see me on the block
Keep my money in a knot with a rubberband on it
Blow to marijuana, know I got it if you want it
See me standin' on the corner, slangin' that crack
You know how it is to be the man in trap

[Hook]
I'm the dopeman nigga the dopeman nigga the dope the dope dope the dopeman nigga
I'm the dopeman nigga the dopeman nigga the dope the dopeman the dopeman nigga
I'm the dopeman nigga the dopeman nigga the dope the dope dope the dopeman nigga
I'm the dopeman nigga the dopeman nigga (From a ki' to a G, it's all about money)

[Verse 1]
Look, bet all you see is tats, money, grills, and chains
But if you scratch the surface you can feel the pain
Names change but the situation still the same
The bills need payin' nigga simple and plain
Take a young'n who's aspirin' to get him some change
Won't nobody hire him so he get in the game
Went and bought a 50 slab, divide it up into ten
Sold 'em all, double down, did it again
By then you got enough to buy a quarter ounce
You sellin' dimes to forty fiends buy it and bounce
Throw some money to your momma keep some food in the house
Cop the outfit and the Jordans on the day they came out
Betta get ya self a pistol know the jackers is out
Flip another seven grams, oh you hustlin' now
Time to get yourself a half, make sure it's some glass
A hundred bags sell it fast stack a G now you officially

[Hook]

(I betcha think you pretty good at it now, huh?)

[Verse 2]
Now once you flipped a couple o's know the game get gravy
Take twelve fifty go git ya two and a baby
Yeah sixty three grams if you whip that right
You should get back five or six that night Stack that money and repeat that twice
Buy you somethin' to ride in, ya gotta be tight
Next time you buy somethin' take twenty-five hundred
Get four and a half it come back in nine don't it
Now stay low key when the money keep comin'
Keep some niggas on ya team to show these suckas they don't want it
By then your connect will clearly see you on ya grind
Shit you come to get a nine and he front you what you buyin'
As long as you bring back your money on time
And if you snort blow, do it on your own time
At this rate you'll be at a brick in no time
They say the want some weight, tell them niggas stand in line

[Hook]

(Stay with me now shawty, here comes the fun part)

[Verse 3]
Now the robbers plottin' on ya and your name stay buzzin'
You caught a sale case down in Macon with your cousin
Your connect ain't worried, you and him cool
He know you'll never tell what you and him do
A mob of a hundred just a few of them true
You heard a worker snictchin' on you and it's true
Everybody know you sell that shit
The feds come and get ya, shit we heard you
Tote that tool, make that double
Better be cool, you don't want no trouble
Keep it leanin' to the left, my gat stay cocked
I'm always super clean when you see me on the block
Keep my money in a knot with a rubberband on it
Blow that marijuana know I got it if you want it
See me standin' on the corner slangin' that crack
You know how it is to be the man in trap
I'll show you how to be a

Hey shorty, real talk: I'mma tell it like it is, ya dig? Them other cats give you half of it cause they don' known no better I'mma give you the whole story though. This shit a dead end street, partner. Take it from a nigga who been there.

If you out ta make a million dollars in the game I betcha you get a hundred years...
