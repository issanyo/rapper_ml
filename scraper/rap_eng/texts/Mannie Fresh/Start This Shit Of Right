[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, just a watch and a mink coat
Even my biatch got a mink coat, yeah
Her pink purse match her pink clothes
When you hoes knock, we dont check the peephole, yeah
Just a watch and a mink coat
Say she love me long time like Kelis hoe, yeah
Her pink purse match the makeup
And when the water get too hot, I got a Steamboat
Tell my doctor "No prescribe, no placebo"
I'm cooking up, crack house like a Bistro
Everybody throw a 5, Carter cinco
[?] been too dry not a drink hoe
Monotony a hero, When I die please bury me in street clothes
Slap the piss outta nigga like a P.O
Bad bitches in this bitch, but I ain't seen yours
Bad bitches in this bitch, but I ain't seen yours
Pretty girl I want my third leg between yours!
Bad ass dog by the screen door
And I'm walking round the house
Wearing nothing but a watch and a mink coat, yeah
Now who gon' tell me something?
Nigga what, Nigga ha? She don't tell me "No"
And she let me do whatever
I just let her know, bitch you better know
Everybody throw a 5, throw a 5, Carter cinco
This my last hoorah, oops I mean hooray
That's why I'm finito

We gon start this shit off right
