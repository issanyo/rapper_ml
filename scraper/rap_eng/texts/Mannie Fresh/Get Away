[Intro]
Sleepy people, sleepy people
Tell me what's going on in your mind
Sleepy people, sleepy people
How can you sleep in these troubled times, times?
(Wake up!)

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on (what!)

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
I put the piece on chain, I did that shit for the haters
Made in the image of greatness, I got that there from my maker
Skipped over the minor leagues and took that shit to the majors
Fuck all that salt they was tossing, sauce got plenty of flavor
I'm on my shine like a chrome grill when the sun out like gold spill
That plate on the time machine that sat on some chrome wheels
For all of them busters that's faking front like they for the cause
Blocking the shots you taking cause they know you bout to ball on these hoes
King Tut with the gold, skating all on the low
Prison system enrolled, big time hope that you choke
All that bullshit that they serving
I come from where you whip it in the kitchen 'til it's twerking out the pot
Put my faith in God even when it's dark, I won't stop
Flip them high beams on, hit the gas to the top
I got love for my people, they got love for me
I know my power and my worth and they bullshit free

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
I put that house on hill just to startle the neighbors
Pull up, subwoofers still quaking, let it be known that I made it
From the box that they put me in because of my Nubian skin
Now I rollerskate in cul-de-sacs on twenty twen twens
Oh Lord, there goes the neighborhood
I'm whipping and dipping, the law won't stop me but wish they could
But the tag hood, digi dash good, nothing wrong here
Big bank, fuck what you think, I belong here on these
Hoes, ain't nothin' stopping me on my mission
Set my team up, raise my ring up if you play our position
Out the park when I swing, it don't matter who pitching
Boobie Miles under lights, hater this God-given
I can't wait on the government, got to do it myself
Stack all my chips up, never gon' slip-up case my folks need some help
Hey, I got love for my people, they got love for me
I know my power and my worth and they bullshit free

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on

[Outro: Rolynne Anderson]
Sleepy people, sleepy people

Gotta get away

Gotta get away, ohhh, ohhhh
Ohh, hey, ohhh, get away
I gotta get away
I gotta get away, oh
