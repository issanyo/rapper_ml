Fifty fifty a gram raw cut dilly
Got minks on my body cause it cost too much (cost too much)

See these gangstas pimps and thugs make the world go round (gangstas, pimps and thugs)
Ride for uptown and till they lay you down
Birdman with them big chips with the bird lady and the benzes (benzes)

The birdman daddy keeps the bricks taped tight
A hundred of them things got my chips same night
Pull up in the Bentley with them skinny ass tires
Ice all over cause a nigga so fly (so fly)

Nothing on chain put them dubs on the thangs
Wipe a nigga down bitch give a nigga brains (wipe a nigga down bitch give a nigga brains)
Call a nigga changed ma wash a nigga range
Bird baby down with them cardier frames
Gucci from head to toe and stunna my name
Make winter weather and that's my thang

And I'm labeled as a pimp and I mack a ho
Biatch!

They all on the floor cause the brains is flying
On the outside it's just them 20 inch tyres

Got the old school caddie's and them new school too
Platinum mouth niggas and them gold mouth too
