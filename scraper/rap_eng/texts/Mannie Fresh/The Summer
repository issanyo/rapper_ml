[Intro]
Check this out, woadie
Lil B for Lil Boss
Doin' this shit for 2010
BasedGod, nigga!

[Hook]
Baby girl, it's the summer
Work that pussy like a NASCAR driver
Baby girl, it's the summer
Got a wet pussy, I'ma fuck you in the Hummer

[Verse 1]
Rich pretty boys, I done fucked her whole mouth
Came in the club with about 10 stacks
Bitch came back with about 10 hoes
Playboy mansion, girl playin' with her nose
Lyin' ass Cindy, wack ass Martha
Bitch suck my dick cause I look like Parker
Hoes on my dick cause I look like their father
Bling, bling, bling, suck my dick in the Bentley
S550 with limousine tints
Damn straight I'm a soldier, straight from the 7
West side Berkeley, south side stepper
Pounds in the closet, money in the dresser
Bitch look at me, I look like money
Floss on a bitch, toss on a bitch
Bitch look about me, I look like Jesus
Nigga fuck with me, came straight with the heater

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
A-B-C, bitch, twerk it to the floor, bitch
Come around here, I'ma fuck you like a ho, bitch
Grade A nasty, bitch come against me
Iced out wrist make the hoes come with me
Bought a little head and it cost 250
Look at my face, bitch I look like Jiffy
Peanut butter walls, three ice chains
Blonde hair bitch and she love givin' brain
Big ass house, layin' hoes on the mattress
Real hood nigga so you know I get savage
Young BasedGod came twenty with the sixes
Young BasedGod fucked four or five bitches
[?] comin' with that [?]
Disrespect my [?] the dresser
Respect my mind, knock the brakes off that pussy
Suck my dick, bitch, player hatin' on you pussies

[Hook x2]
