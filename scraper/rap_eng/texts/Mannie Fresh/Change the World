[Pre Hook: Lil' Wayne]
What, what, what, what, what, what
Huh (Huh)
What (What)
If I could change the world (If I could change the world)
Huh (Huh)
What (What - what)

[Lil Wayne]
Look
If I had the world, dog, I'd make hustlin' good
And if I could I'd put work every hustler's hood
[B.G.]
I can't lie - this world is scary to me
I carry two gats - you won't hear nobody buryin' me
[Juvenile]
None of my people would have to pay tax or bills
Even all the new niggas oughtta average a mill
[Mannie]
If I could change the score, we'd never hustle no more
And every bizite that I lizight 'll be like "whoa"
[Lil' Wayne]
And the police would be for here only for the old folks
So if we have a problem, we strap up and hold court
[B.G.]
If I could change it - man, if the world was mine
Nobody'd have to take nothin' cause we'd all shine
[Juvenile]
If I ruled the world, nigga wouldn't have no beef
It'll be a decline in the murder rate on the streets
[Baby]
If the world was mine we wouldn't need no killers
We'll put A/C in these project windows

[Pre Hook]

[Hook: Unplugged]
If I could change the world
I'd make it much better for you and me
I'd erase these hard times we had, yeah
And we'd ball 'til we fall - can you feel that?
Yeeeeeaaaaahhhhh

[Mannie]
Come on, let's do this shit - yo, my party don't quit
And every record Cash Money put out 'll be a hit
[Lil' Wayne]
I'd dig a ditch for the hatas, put 'em deeper with that
And I could murder a nigga and wouldn't spend a week in the pen
[B.G.]
Man, we'd all have houses, a half-a-block
We'd all be on chrome in a Benz drop-top
[Juvenile]
All the women would be big, fine with a cute face
And the children would be the kind that stay in they place
[Baby]
If the world was mine I'd unite my peeps
My mom and my dad would be in this world with me
[Lil' Wayne]
But if a nigga still trip, you can hit him with Glock
And just to keep it real I'll bring back Biggie and Pac
[B.G.]
Man, we'd all get along - we'll be a family
That's just how it'll be if this world was for me
[Juvenile]
If I ruled the world, wouldn't be no politics
Blacks would have a lot of shit - that Bentley and that Prowler shit

[Pre Hook]
[Hook]

[Juvenile]
More blunts to smoke up on the streets with peace
Without a worry on our mind, not duckin' police
[Mannie]
If we could go back in time, you could have what's mine
That's for shig my nig - we ain't gotta slang that iron
[Lil' Wayne]
Play the block all day without runnin' and duckin'
And everybody drugs raw - they don't cut it with nothin'
[B.G.]
It ain't mine - I just gotta get it how I live
Can't question God on what He made a biz what it is
[Juvenile]
If I ruled the world, my family wouldn't fight
Everything in order - everybody all right
[Baby]
If the world was mine I'll still be grindin'
I'll flip big blocks for (?) and Bryan
[Lil' Wayne]
And if you move a hundred bricks, you get a Benz for free
Oh yeah, and Beyonce'll have twins for me
[B.G.]
Man, if this world was for the lil' B.G
Everybody'd be straight, everybody'd live sweet - uh-huh
