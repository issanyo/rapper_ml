Verse 1:
Excuse me, let me introduce me
La, la uptown top of the line HB
See i'm a million dollar nigga

Ain't too many can touch

I'm fifteen with fifteen karats
And fifteen figures with fifteen niggers
And fifteen hummers with triggers

Up the million dollar spot
Want to flex what I got
Make niggas sick like a drop
Every show I get
You can give a quarter key
Tryin to ?? sale but they cost six-five to see me
While we be goin shows Baby transporting keys
Findin' out always to beat the N.O.P.D

Some six generation technology that's only made for movies
Comin' from Tennessee and I'm in Lousiville  on 23rd street
Hangin with this hot boy chillin
Tryna find a way to drop a hundred keys on these niggas
And I peep in this shit that be shinin like me , nigga

One million, two million, three
Oh! it's my part

And sparkle like a bezzel
Ridin' up yo' block
In the fully loaded ledger
And the navigator on ??
But that's for tommorrow though
Shaggin' up for hundred
With fat julius and Mario
That slut that's me
In the GS 3
So play the backseat
Suck on meat watch yo' teeth
And um wipe yo feet
'Fore you step on the marble
