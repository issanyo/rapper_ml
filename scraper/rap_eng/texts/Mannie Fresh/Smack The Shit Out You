[Intro]
This one right here, only for dropouts
You weak at heart, get the fuck off the dance floor

What did the five fingers say to the face?


[Verse 1]
Ladies love me and so do the haters
I rock the mic for all you surfers and skaters
Gold chains straight say my name
Got the white spandex with the champagne stain, mane
Some Dirt Nasty shit, bitch

(Smack the shit out you)
If you hit on my bitch
(Smack the shit out you)
Touch my car
(Smack the shit out you)
Smoke my weed
(Smack the shit out you)
Step on my Chucks
(Smack the shit out you)
Eat my chicken
(Smack the shit out you)
Kick my dog
(Smack the shit out you)
Fuck my mom
(Smack the shit out you)

[Hook]
I dare you to show me your tits
I dare you to blow this dick
I dare you, I dare you
I dare you, I dare you

Fuck y'all posers

[Verse 2]
Now everybody say "Suck my dick"
It don't matter if you poor or rich
I don't care if you nice or a bitch
Just whip out those juicy tits
I just want to get my dick sucked, baby
And I don't care if you a niptuck lady
I dare you to grab my package
And it's snowing in LA like it's fucking Alaska

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Smack that ass like a step dad
With the right and the left hand
Fuck with me, you a dead man
Your bitch give good head, man
Come with me to the VIP
Underage, you don't need ID
But we're gonna need a IV from the alcohol poisoning
That's right, we're getting fucked up
