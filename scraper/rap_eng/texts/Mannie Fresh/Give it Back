I thought I met a good man whose name I won't discuss

Now I'mma walk out that door, taking everything with me
Give it to me back

You say you want your car back and the keys to your house

Give it to me back

[Mannie]
Ladies and gentlemen
Daddy got a new thing
Bless her with a diamond ring
Keep her neck like bling a ling a ling a ling
You can go ahead vacate, this was just a big mistake
Tell your lawyer call my lawyer
He will tell you what to take
Phone numbers, real change, attitude real strange
Used to eat big steaks but now you eatin' chicken wings
Sometimes I be flippin', don't know what I be sayin'
Call your lawyer back baby, I was just playin'

[Toni]

Let's just say it's like fifty, no not quite that
(Give my uh-uh back)
Let's say like 47.9 percent
That's, you know, that's my way to love
(Give my uh-uh back)
You just hang in there, baby
Keep your head up
(Give my uh-uh back)
And one day, I will love you
Until then, take your uh-uh back
Ya'll heard (What)
