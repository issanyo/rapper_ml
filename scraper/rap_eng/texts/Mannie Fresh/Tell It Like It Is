It was one late night
What happened was i wis wit my dudes wife
She said he outta town (the nigga gone?)
My dick said pimpin we be all alone
Then we got real naked
She tried to give it to me unprotected
Stop, wait, hold up aminute lemme put my rubber on then we did it
In and out, out and in
I worked that pussy till a quarter passed ten
She said boy you do the damage, i said yea get up and fix a pimp a motherf**kin samwich
I fell asleep like fast
A sandwich a bed and a lil bit of ass
I woke up hot yall ready to burst
And if ya wanna hear the rest check out the second verse

I guess u wanna kno what happened next
The same f**kin thing we started havin sex
Then i heard the phone ring
She ignored the motherf**ker cause she gettin good dingaling
I banged her head against the wall when
The phone keep ringin ( who the f**k is this callin?)
I grabbed the thing and pulled it out the socket
Then put my pullstick back in her center pocket
She said you make me feel so great
And i love ya like a fat kid loves cake
Thats 50 line bitch cut it out

And if u really love me trick put the dick in your mouth
She sucked my thang and im about to skket
She vegetarian but she love my meat
Now im about to die of thirst
Brains like a motherf**ka listen to the third verse

Now im in the nigga elevator
On my way downstairs lookin through his refrigerator
Then i yell where ur husband at
She said gone and i dnt kno when he comin back
The nigga ball wit the hornets
And tonight philidelphia they aponents
Then i heard the door open up ( WHO THE F**K!!)
I thought to myself another happy home broken up
Then i reach for my weapon
Before this nigga go to trippin
She said wait let me stop him
You better bitch or im guna have to pop him
Naked as a motherf**ker gun in my hand
Shorty for real u need to talk to your man
The same shit happened to biggie
Happy as a motherf**ker cause i got my gun wit me

Tell it like it is(7x)
