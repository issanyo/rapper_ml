[B.G.]
I be thug'n and it ain't no secret
I run game so when it's ran on me I can peep it
My mind frame set on stacking six figures plus
I let 'em hang so when shit gets real heads get bust
I ain't the one that gets caught up and see an early grave
Being all the way true to the game is how I was raised
Niggas I came up under got nothing but street ways
Niggas I came up under tote nothing but AK's
They sat me down schooled me where at an early age
So off top I lay it down when I feel played
Meet Lil fat Kenny, Faire and my dog Schraie
When  I catch you down bad, where you stand is where you lay
I don't plan for the future, I live day for day
Cross my path I'll execute cha, respect what I say
VL niggas play it raw, you could trust that
I got the key in the car me and Baby got the Glock and map
We thugged out

Chorus: repeat 2X

I be thugging and it ain't no secret
I run game so when it rains on me I can peep it
I represent to the fullest what you bout I'm bout
Freedom or jail I'm always gonna be thugged out, thugged out

[B.G.]
Lil Geezy be thugging to the fullest
Stay strapped, so when drama kickin' ready to pull it
You want beef with my niggas, look here bring it on
I'm bout that dome checkin, and I'm gone let it be known
I'm a roam, through your hood when I see you duck
Whoevers on the block gets two cause I drop my nuts
Realism is in my nature thats how its gotta be
I'm a fire that can't be put out ain't no stopping me
They dont call B.G. a Hot Boy for nothing
I'm bout gangster shit, and hoes know I'm working with something
I was chillin in Timbermen with my dogs thugging
Some niggas buckin
But alot of niggas button
The UPT is where I stunt, nigga thats my hometown
And everybody knows that on Sunday it be going down
So until I die I'ma be about that street shit
I'm bout mine
And I ain't the one you wanna beef with
I'm thugged out

Chorus: repeat 2X

[B.G.]
Look my block hot the law sleep every other day
We beefin off top, we creep every other day
My dog Malcolm on a charge, he gets parole up in May
He told me where he left the Glock, K ????
I run with niggas thats bout drama, well lets get funky
Slip I duct tape your momma, my dogs are donkeys
We bout  are business, so you better act like you know
Play possum, so its a must we play you like a fuckin' hoe
I'm true to the game, play it exactly how it goes
I lay my rep down with the Benz off the showroom floor
I'm swimming in a pool of hundreds
Lil Dougie be thuggin, but Lil Dougie got beacoup money
Niggas know my click had the crowd buckin'
Niggas know my click is the click that be on T.V. stuntin'
Niggas know my click is the click, play with us and we bustin'
Niggas know my click is the click that be straight thuggin'
We thugged out

Chorus: repeat 2X

[B.G. Talking]
