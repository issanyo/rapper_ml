[Verse 1: Mannie Fresh]
I fuck these hoes
After our shows
Big dicks, we slang
Freak bitch, do ya' thang, do ya' thang
Benz, Vettes, Hummers, Jets
Rolex, mo' sex
Television, head rest
Twenty inches, nothin' less
Every day, iced out
Nigga play, 'lights out'
M period, Fresh, comma
Yo' wife is my baby mama
Goddamn motherfucker
She's a good dick sucker
What the fuck, hold on
Everybody get yo' roll on

[Chorus]
Everybody get yo' roll on
Everybody get yo' motherfuckin' roll on
What
Everybody get yo' roll on
Everybody get yo' motherfuckin' roll on
What
Everybody get yo' roll on
Everybody get yo' motherfuckin' roll on
What
Everybody get yo' roll on
Everybody get yo' motherfuckin' roll on
What

[Verse 2: Baby]
Beatrice, bitch please
You know who I be
Nothin' else, none other
The number one stunner
Nigga, I pimp hoes
Boss, toss, flip hoes
Show them bitches no love
Ridin 2G 'llac on dubs
Ounces, quarters, halves, bricks
Nigga I done sold all that shit
Soon as my tour stop
Bought five Bentley Azures, props
TV's must, buttons must
C.M.B., platinum plus
What the fuck, hold on
Everybody get yo' motherfuckin' roll on

[Chorus]
Everybody get yo' roll on
Everybody get yo' motherfuckin' roll on
What
Everybody get yo' roll on
Everybody get yo' motherfuckin' roll on
What
Everybody get yo' roll on
Everybody get yo' motherfuckin' roll on
What
Everybody get yo' roll on
Everybody get yo' motherfuckin' roll on
What

[Verse 3: Mannie Fresh and Baby]
I like loud pipes
Big rims, mo' ice
V-twelves or better
No itch strictly leather
Playstation, DVD's
Don't worry about yo bitch
She comin' wit' me
Leavin' stickers on the Bentley
To show the price
Arm out the windows
Just to floss my ice
Fresh, wait hold up
That's that bitch we fucked
Nigga what yo' bank 'bout
Dog I've been lost count
Pop that Crist', pop that Mo'
Slap that bitch, punch that ho
What the fuck, hold on
Everybody get yo' motherfuckin' roll on

[Chorus]
Everybody get yo' roll on
Everybody get yo' motherfuckin' roll on
What
Everybody get yo' roll on
Everybody get yo' motherfuckin' roll on
What
Everybody get yo' roll on
Everybody get yo' motherfuckin' roll on
What
Everybody get yo' roll on
Everybody get yo' motherfuckin' roll on
What
