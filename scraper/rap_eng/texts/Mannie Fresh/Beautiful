[Mannie Fresh]
Now I'm feeling good and fine
Smokin green and drinkin wine
Ten thousand dollars at the bar (all on baby)
I guess that makes me a super-duper star
Drinkin ripple and Tanqueray
A brand new drink I call it bri-barae

(Chorus)
My life is beautiful
(Livin that good life)
It's just beautiful
(Livin that good life)(2x)

[Mannie Fresh]
Take me baby to the motel
When we're finished you can go tell
Teresa, Lisa, and Dawn
How we got butt-naked and got it on
How I split ya, hit ya and brung ya home
Stole ya chains and rings and herringbones

(Chorus)

(Hook)
Dont hate me baby cause I'm beautiful
These flashy cars ain't new to y'all(2x)

[Spoken : Mannie Fresh]
How you love that 1998
Thats Big Tymer style
There's a lot of these niggas baller blockin
Standin in the way
Cause I'm gone shine
All the time
How you love that (yeah)
On the bass
Funky Fingaz can I get a woday
On the keys just woday (woday)
Just woday (woday)
Big woday (woday)
Take it to the bridge take it to the bridge

(Bridge)
Just rollerskate rollerskate
Dont player hate player hate(2x)

(Chorus)

[Spoken : Mannie Fresh]
This here is platinum material
Just light, light-weight track
How you love that
It's gorgeous out here
I'm a neighborhood superstar
I'd rather be young rich and local
Than nationwide and broke bro
All the time (all the time)
All the time
Y'all can say what you want about me
I got this man
Drinks is on me
Everybody order something, drinks on me
Everything on me (moet, moet)
I love myself
I love myself, I love myself
Shouts out to the whole city
The broads alright but the niggas pretty
