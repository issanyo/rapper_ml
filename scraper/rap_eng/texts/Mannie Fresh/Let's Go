[Intro]
It's been a long time coming but I know a change gone come....

[Verse 1]
? the path, the path chose me
This Allah's plan, divine degree
Natural high, window sheet
Up parallel view let the ghetto see
BK home to, no LA
All about that G-O-D, Amazing Grace
Hater whispers, blah blah blah
You too serious for nothing, hardy har
But it's no joke, with a winning smile
And one voice, with many styles
Been fresh, get fresh, see who fresher now
Strong bow, ox flow, watch it pull a plow
I'm goin in, they out of luck
Na sucker is there another, hit one o one
Cause of it,  the December slim
Block going first, I am him
This rap authentic, it's not a gimmick
Who went dumb and stay dumb, lord forgive him
I don't mind the cynics, I mind my business
Stay way above the game, that ass clever

[Hook]
Let's go, let's go, let's get it
Let's go, let it go
Let it go, let's get it
Get it, get it, got em, got em
Let's go, let's go, let's get it
Let's go, let it go
Let it go, let's get it

[Verse 2]
Super mathematics
Now that probably known for that O block
So sign a waiver to that old rock
Super smart, hand crafted art, decided on they know lot
Flow tougher than tough town, blacker than the ground they jump round
Overdose I'm over woke, be awake from crunch time
Be everywhere like sunshine
Leap right across, punchline
I beat the track, I eat the track, but I don't pay for breakfast
Lunch time
Dinner date, desert tray, Ramadan
Flow hungry, you see the sign between the line
That jeans only, no ?
I flow lovely, they go lovely
They catch feelings, these hoes touch me
I tell that ho like don't bunch me
Home awakening, like home study
But you so perdy, best of show
Tryin find the best way to touch it, let's go

[Hook]

[Outro]
Mathematics
Before I chose the path, the path chose me
Allah's Plan, divine degree
Your captain speaking, Pilot seek
