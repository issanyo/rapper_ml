[Intro]
Still fuck her like I used to
And that's no strings attached she my blue tooth

[Verse 1 - Young Stoney]
Uh
Adidas on her panty line
She bring all her friends over, fuck her while they stand in line
I hit yo girl like a car collision
And when I'm done I park her kitten
Then I spark the different
Different as you ain't never seen this weed
I just call it gas, got my brain into sixth speed
Big green, shit free and you already know my bitch mean
Bitch please, I flip shit on the track like my Austin partner flip keys
Yeah I go to college but I'll never be that frat rap
Adidas on my backpack
Texas on my snapback
That's a metaphor cause jump at Texas and we'll snap back
Adida Gang the shit and you a gross plumbers ass crack
And I be getting super drunk even till I'm dizzy
Fuck her next to Bay Hall and pass her ass to Izzy
Stoney Wright be my name, there's no further details
Females dressed seashells all talking so delicate
My joints are over pregnant
Me and Drey be getting hella lit
If she look like an angel I'm a hit her with this Devil dick
Lil' bitch

[Hook - Young Stoney]
(You know I)
Put it down for the TAMU
All you pretty bitches getting fucking ran through
You know that every things gravy

So pour the shot up and take it while we blaze tree

[Verse 2 - Yung Drey]
(I'm doing shit they ain't' used to
We going hard, we the new crew
New Era Click, better get used to

I'm repping my city and that TAMU-CC
Puffing on that seaweed
That sticky blue and green
On the bayside's where you'll find me
Yung Drey putting in work with my nigga Stoney
I stay cool in the winter and I wear a tank in the summer
These hoes all so bitter, they want to love me, what a bummer
Eat that Wonton soup for dinner then I fuck her in the hummer
They that they winners but they don't ever get my number
Bitches want to play cause I'm that nigga Yung Drey
The good girls stay away because I do it so cray
I fuck 'em so good they don't even know which way
And then I'm eating up this beat and leave these haters in dismay
Ahh!

[Verse 3 - Young Stoney]
Corpus Christi yeah
That my city yeah
Getting busy yeah throwing fifty up yeah
Shots to the brain got me all kinds of sluring
If she let me on her curves you know I'm gon' be swerving
If she let me eat the pussy you know I be slurping
She give brain while I do my homework call that shit researching
Clothes smelling like I use dank for my detergent
I swear we smoke so much loud I'm gonna need a hearing aid
Catch me anytime and I'm probably wearing A's
As a younging knew I had it so I had to make a habit
I just put in the air with smoke but no loving tricks, this is just pure magic
Even Orlando know
Shout out San Antone, shout out to the Den
Shout to the islanders who were bred to win
We get in every minute, every second
Every time we in it is a blessing
Nah we ain't stressing
We be straight flexing motherfucker

[Hook - Young Stoney]
(You know I)
Put it down for the TAMU
All you pretty bitches getting fucking ran through
You know that every things gravy

She bust it open like it's motherfucking brand new
Got the campus going crazy
Young Stoney motherfucker, it's AG
So pour the shot up and take it while we blaze tree
