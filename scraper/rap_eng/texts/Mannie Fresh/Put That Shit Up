[Baby talking]
Um hmm...fo sho
You can do big thangs when you're a Big Tymer
And even if you ain't nigga just keep grindin' nigga
You really ain't got to have golf balls you can have pebbles
Ya know? Just have your game on

[(Chorus) Lac + Mannie Fresh]
Lac: If your riding on 16's than put that bitch up
Mannie: Oh 20 dub deuces is how we do that there yo
Lac: If you ride with an ugly chick than trade that bitch in
Mannie: Get you a dime that's how you do the damn thing friend
Lac: If your diamonds ain't shining up than put that shit up
Mannie: 1-800-Iceman - ice yourself up
Lac: Cutlass to the Benz, Monte Carlo, Impala
Mannie: DVD to the TV that mean you can HOLLA!

[Baby]
(???????) the house and somethin'
Bought a green diamond - 30 carrots for stuntin'
I'm the boss of your ghetto, black crow of this game
Slide me 200 G's and I'll do anything
I've done a little bit of it all
Mom how your son is known to ball
I put 22's on everything I call
The Jag, the Bentley, Rolls-Royce, the house wall
Hung out with Bobby, ate breakfast with Whitney
Made it official New York is my city nigga
Got a trophy from the game ya'll know my name
Baby - Number one stunna, car showing my thang
Got a house on the lake I built from cake
Cooking pies and hustling for rubian flakes
I put dub deuces on the Avalanche truck
I break rules cause I don't give a fuck

[(Chorus) Lac + Mannie Fresh]
Lac: If your riding on 16's than put that bitch up
Mannie: Oh 20 dub deuces that's how we do that there yo
Lac: If you ride with an ugly chick than trade that bitch in
Mannie: Get you a dime that's how you do the damn thing friend
Lac: If your diamonds ain't shining that put that shit up
Mannie: 1-800-Iceman - ice yourself up
Lac: Cutlass to the Benz, Monte Carlo, and Prowler
Mannie: DVD to the TV that mean you can HOLLA!

[Stone]
I say this on 22's that cost a half-a-mill
When me and Baby be coming through like ya'll rappers for real?
Now I be slinging blocks, totting two twin Glocks
Pushing a 600 Benz, rims spin when I stop
Jock, it's alright you see the watch ya'll like
Like I just copped a porsche box three tint with the frog lights
Than it's alright kit it with a chrome small pipe
With killer Stone on the left and Hot Boys on right

[Lac]
Nigga I ridin in some Z71 type shit
Limo tinted cause I'm creeping with a fine bright bitch
Aston Martin got a new thang that I just might get
And if Puffy give a party he invite my click
We gone pop that shit, say wodie where the bottles at?
Hello, who this is? Im with stunna bitch holla back
Princess and baguettes to out shine you cock suckers
Riding on some Ferris wheel's - Bigger than a mother fucker!

[(Chorus) Lac + Mannie Fresh]
Lac: If your riding on 16's than put that bitch up
Mannie: Oh 20 dub deuces is how we do that there yo
Lac: If you ride with an ugly chick than trade that bitch in
Mannie: Get you a dime that's how you do the damn thing friend
Lac: If your diamonds ain't shining that put that shit up
Mannie: 1-800-Iceman - ice yourself up
Lac: Cutlass to the Benz, Monte Carlo, and Prowler
Mannie: DVD to the TV that mean you can HOLLA!

[Mannie Fresh]
Rims - 22, chick - 22, dick about 22
Playboy, now who the fuck are you?
I'm mister two-door coupes
Is that the cracker-gator boots?
With the two piece Gucci suits
2-way hanging off the loops
Zazigga-zan, Zazigga-zigga-zigga-zan
Give me the watch, the bracelet and the chain
Fuck your Bentley - too slow ya heard?
Lamborghini in first "clock, clock unnn unn skkkkiiirrrrrt!"

[Mikkey]
You know Mikkey play the Air Ones - loosely laced
So I might lose a shoe when the groupies chase
The coup be straight - but truth be I prefer the range
The sex be feelin great but I prefer the brains
We got dollars by the billions
Choppers by the buildings
Chances of falling off is "Slim" like "Ronald Williams" Holla
You can find me changing lanes in the Aston
Leaning back with your dame laughing come on (haha)

[(Chorus) Lac + Mannie Fresh]
Lac: If your riding on 16's than put that bitch up
Mannie: Oh 20 dub deuces is how we do that there yo
Lac: If you ride with an ugly chick than trade that bitch in
Mannie: Get you a dime that's how you do the damn thing friend
Lac: If your diamonds ain't shining that put that shit up
Mannie: 1-800-Iceman - ice yourself up
