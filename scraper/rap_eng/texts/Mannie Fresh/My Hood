[Intro - B.G.]
Hey world!
Oh I'm back!
I'm back and I'm better than ever!
What up Fresh?
This one here feel good homie!
It remind me of the old days, you heard me?

[Chorus - Gar] X2
It feels good, I still get love in my hood
Haters still wishing they could
But they can't because
I'm still getting it, getting it, get getting it, getting it man

[Verse 1 - B.G.]
B.G. still the same old same old
Nothing change, play the game how the game go
Pants sag, white tee, and a Kangol
I ain't got to hustle, but I still hang low
A few hate, that's what I ride with that thing for
It's going down if they run up on that Range Rove
It's going down if they test a nigga man hood
Every ghetto in New Orleans I done ran through it
I done seen a lot, and I done, done a lot
When I was young I had dreams I run the block
When I was young yeah my momma used to fuss a lot
But now she proud because her son is living on the top

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - B.G.]
It feels good to be fortunate and give back
See the old lady walking, stop, and help her with her bags
Forget where I come from? Dog, never that
Every time I leave they asking me "When you coming back?"
I say fuck it and I let the whole hood come
And now I got the whole hood on my tour bus

Uptown represent it till the end of time
Uptown, I done lost a lot a friends of mine
I'm on the grind so you know I'm out here getting mine
Like Curtis I'ma get rich or die trying
I fell a few times, I never gave up
Got up, got a pack, hit the hood, made up

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - B.G.]
You know me, I be everywhere the thugs be
Convicted felon, but be everywhere the guns be
I'm a gangster, the whole hood love me
You's a buster, I know you wish you was me
Man this life that I'm living dog is lovely
I'm like him, but you know you can't touch me
I appreciate what the hood done me
It made me a man, made me a O.G
It made me a man, made me a go getter
It showed me how to never be a broke nigga
I'll never be a quitter, always be a winner
I'm in the hood growing like a rainbow nigga

[Chorus]
[Outro - B.G.]
Feels good to be a gangster
You heard me?
I said damn it feels good to be a gangster
New Orleans, Uptown, 13th Ward, Magnolia
The king baby
Holler back
You heard me?
