[Verse 1: B.G.]
I duck off, cause the law
Lookin for B.G
Sayin that I killed a nigga around the club last week
Left the scene ridin in a big body
So I flipped the script now I'm in a ES three
Playin by different bitches cuz my face in the paper
Hoe drove by fore' she could describe me, I got the eraser
I don't discriminate I flip a bitch too
She got to be eleminated I kill a bitch too
She her hair fixed by my sister she lost she gonna get her
To let me drop her off by this nigga
Off the river
She ridin with me thinkin that it's cool and shit
She dont think I know that she let her lips loose and shit
I'm gonna pull over pull her out and pop some slugs in the bitch
And leave her pussy stinkin cuz I dont love a bitch
But I was taught comin up, never trust a bitch
And don't hesitate for a minute to chug the bitch
She was tryin to get me locked up
It was a must that the ho get popped up
Fuckin with me best believe that I'll cool ya block
Got ya sayin them Hot Boy niggas too too hot
Too too hot

[Hook - Juvenile]
What do ya call a nigga that be duckin the law? ( Hot Hot)
