[Verse 1]
Whoadie ain't no stopping this I don't know what you thought
Especially with these diamonds that turn it light when its dark
I came to see what's hap'n with getting this money
But first, let me get a few things to you dummies
All that repping and stunting it's not good for your health
You'd be better loading up a gun and smashing yourself
Nigga don't love that hoe, nigga just fuck that hoe
One night is just about as far as it go
Them lil' boys that you roaming with is not yo' patnas
They waiting for bad time and they woulda been got ya
40 stop your heart, thats why we call it a heart stopper
Book me for a show if you want a real show rocker
I keep forgetting that I'm only 19
Half of the shit that I've seen nigga you wouldn't believe
Too many heads getting bust
Why would I trust ya?
They be out here playing it sour just like some mustard
That's your problem right there
I ain't with all that fussing
Money cars and jewelry man that's my type of discussion
I swear we do this shit like its nothing
JLR down South yea nigga we run this

[Chorus](x2)
Getcha getcha getcha grind on
One things for sure Imma get mine on
You ain't heard nothing like this in so long
You gotta love it, I keeps it real to the bone

[Verse 2]
Real people gon' like it, and the fake gon' hate
If you wait, Imma be drinking champagne in your state
(?) off cause I made her patiently wait
But she was like me, want to fuck something and shake
Man tell you the truth I think I like it that way
If you think how I think, everything will be okay
Hopped on the jet and took a flight around the world
Check mate niggas who be acting like little girls
Ain't nothing better than being a man with power
If you can't go back to your hood that mean you a coward
Old square ass nigga quit acting like you got it
'Fore I make one of my youngins go off in your pocket
I'm a fool like my pa boy
It's something you can't even finish so don't start boy
We ain't got no limits we taking it to far boy
Pull up on you while your girl in the car boy
What's poppin' girly
JLR we a army
Camo down in that ape, gorillas performing
If it's dealing with that cake my nigga I'm on it
Don't be surprised somethin' come in my car what's the warning

[Chorus](x2)
Getcha getcha getcha grind on
One things for sure Imma get mine on
You ain't heard nothing like this in so long
You gotta love it, I keeps it real to the bone
