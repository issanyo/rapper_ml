Lord, born in the projects
Papa was a rolling stone, selling rock crack

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Yo Tunes, pass the steel or bash the steel
My passion real, I'm fashion ill
The pussy niggas are Massengil, mass appeal
My past is real before I had the deal, you dig?
Pies and cakes, out of state
Lies is fake, God don’t make mistakes
Got the girl pussy smelling like codeine syrup
Got the bands on me like a football field, I'm ill
I deserve a threesome for my birthday
If she pretty it's Magic City on the first date
Cup of lean and toast, yeah I’m 'posed to boast
Goodie Mo the quote, not many coming close
Trying to smoke what I never smoked before
Dream what I never dreamed before
Woke up and see my Rolls sky high, I ride by
I drive by, then hop out
