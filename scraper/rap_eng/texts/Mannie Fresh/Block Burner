Verse 1: (lil wayne)

Ha ha ha ha check it

And the black on black
Lil soldier with a mac
I bust back till it crack
You see I ride tonight
Bullets fly at night

And a high tonight when I'm duckin' round the mirrors
I run over niggas like eighteen wheelers
Hungry gorilla
Ah what cha what cha got wootay
Gettin' beef thinks its cool I hit cha hit cha block wootay
Hit cha get cha gurl
Choppa choppa neighborhood
Let his poppa understood

And I swang
Through yo house wit that thang

Now look hang to below the sealevel

Lil boy my chopper make mo noise than a choir
One of these niggas gone leave here brainless
Some of these niggas ain't gone even be remainin'
Look now you keep thinkin' I'm to be played with
My gage spray quick

When I ride with uptown soldiers
I'm comin' up the back my grill start to spark
Opp I'm coming up the front (breathing hard) ya caught
Now where you gone run and where you gone turn
Oohh I got my gun
Oohh chopper bullets burn
To whom it may concern
Chopper bullets burn
Get through your block like a perm
Look weak like sperm

(Chorus) 2x
Now check the whole block the whole block catch a fire
I be the I be the block block on the rider

Verse 2

I spin yo corner with my size 16 sankin'
Lip trangin'
Shootin' 50 automatic
They all black and
Stickin' niggas like patches
Family stackin'
They all burn like matches
Now test me and it will be accidental
Erase like pencils
Use niggas like rentals
Now WHO
Will wanna run up on my crew
Look as COOL
Logger its all on you
See I CRUISE
Up and down your street like the caribbean
Then I release all off my heater from the fifty plus
Ashes to dust I get dirty dirty like mud
Leave one ta bust
And dirty dirty slugs rush
Now hush and everybody keep the noise down
See uptown bout to bring all of you boys down
Got a mean frown
I'm movin' like a po lil bug
Better keep it shut
Fo the whole block get burned up

(Chorus)2x

Verse 3

Thats me up on the back street in black clothes

We run up on you at night whoa nigga whoa
See I explode
And leave brains on the flo

With case Glocks and calicodes

Oo-ooohhh the beat done jumped off
I clear your street with heat from a sawed-off
And all the peeps on yo street get hauled off
Don't fall off
