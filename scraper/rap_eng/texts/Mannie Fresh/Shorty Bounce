Uh yeah, uh yeah, uh yeah, holla at me

(mannie fresh in background)

[Verse One]
Say boooyyyyy
You ain't want to get hit with the AR, AR, 15, 15, flip cars
So just imagine what it do to pussy niggas thats goin against me
I go hhhaaard, I'm so hard
That I'm bruising up my knuckles I'm watching my fist bleed, fist bleed
So whhhaaat
I'm bustin this bustin, this fuckin up everyone that it sees, (hey)
Move to the left, cause you might catch a hot one
Tear a whole square out ya chest with the shotgun
Make a whole pair out one nigga with the shotgun
We can go there, my nigga, I'm so there
Rockinby myself with the chopper on the backseat
Shoot at the driver side knock his body to the backseat
Stop, pause, make them Dominique Dawes
Flippin bitch niggas when the shotty's go off. (hey)

[Hook]
Lose the handguns, we don't cock back nigga
We hold shotguns, we pop that nigga
And when you shoot it, don't it
It make ya body bounce
You do the shorty bounce

And when it hit you don't it
It make ya body bounce
You do the shorty bounce, bounce

Shorty Bounce
Now bounce shorty bounce
Now bounce shorty bounce
It make ya body bounce

[Verse Two]
Now, ay fella
You ain't wanna get hit with the AK, AK, 47, 47, heavy metal
Guns and roses
Roses and dresses
Funeral settins
Blessins
Ay man
You see 'em on them weights
I'm tryna shoot straight, straight shot
Don't lose faith
Homie you safe
Hit ya in ya grill, now they call you two face
This ain't a dance, this a motherfuckin' pressure point
Eartquake, break a nigga down to a decimal
Break a nigga break a nigga down to a vegetable
Lay ya grandmother next to you
This the the untestable, the untouchable
The young stunna do, whatever stunna do
Stop, pause nigga, make them Dominique Dawes
Flippin bitch niggas when the shotty's go off (hey)

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Ay chump
You ain't wanna get hit with this straight pump
Just a pump, with the pump, with the pump
Not the pump, the pump
You know if I get em, he gotta bend, he gotta lean he gotta slump
I shot 'em once, with the buckshots
Make it look like a sun shots
A nice body all dumb hot
He turned cold dead
Anybody in this city cops and feds
Look me in my eyes nah look me in my barrel
Leave a Darryl Strawberry cherry on ya apple
I'm a very scary, new orleans mammal
Shorty on my back got me workin like a camel put a hump in ya back and lift you up
I'm weezy f baby
Guess whats up
Stop pause, make them Dominique Dawes
Flippin bitch niggas when them shotty's go off (hey)

[Hook]
