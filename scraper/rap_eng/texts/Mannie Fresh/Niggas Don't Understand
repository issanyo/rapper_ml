Big Tymers:
Fa sho...this for my homie K.C
That just did ten in tha pen
Bout to spit this game for ya fool

Chorus: [B.G. & Big Tymers]
These niggas don't understand that he tha man
(And on the downlow I'm still sellin' birds they tell me that)
These niggas don't understand that he tha man
(And on the downlow I'm still sellin' birds they tell me that)

First Verse [Baby]
I need me a lick, to come up on a hundred G's
(How B?)
Movin' these fuckin' kees
(Where B?)
Run em' in that U.P.T
(And who gone run em?)
Tha brotha and my B.G

[B.G.]
You gotta beat em
(That nigga is my lady)
Four golds and I'm out there baby

[Baby]
I hit my safe for a hundred and fifty G's
(Why nigga?)
Orderin' for 20 kees
(Street value?)
Two hundred and fifty G's
(And what's yo profit?)
A lick for a hundred G's

[B.G.]
My people, Baby, bout to bring us some heavy Snow white
Mama told me I'ma have to go on that all night flight
Fuck breakin' two hundred I'm breakin' Q.B's
Ziploc'em up and send em to that U.P.T
Never seen a triple beam and so much yay
On his porch stairs, nothin' but mail
One hundred G's with ease now that's no big drama
I keep packin' shit to keep icin' lil' Mama
Too many kees bringin' rats and gats and cadillacs
But through thick and thin, V.L. got my back

Chorus

Second Verse: [Baby]
Fuckin' break these kees down to quarter kees
Let Vamp run em all in the Third Ward U.P.T
K.C. drop this load on my B.G
(Tear da kee)
Bring me back nigga a hundred G's
Nigga get yo shit
(Nigga I got my shit)
Ready to cock yo shit?
(I'm ready to pop my shit)

[B.G.]
I'ma take yo breath, introduce you to death
When you get to Hell, tell em I can follow your map
Tired of flippin' these hustlas, I wanna flip some G's
So what's up wit Baby?
(Graduated from kees)
We gone make this shit happen, we gone flood em out Uptown
And we gone bring and sprinkle a bit downtown
We ride Lexus with interos, MoMos or Cameros
Slim got the coke in a wayside barrel for 22-5
(Got the kees for 11-5)
Come to the B.G. I might do it for a even 5
Nigga I ball and people don't know it, Cuz I don't show it
The only way to find out is if you come and score it
Cuz I don't stop with no ho or no show
I wear my polo, and get a bucket and keep it on the downlow

Chorus

Third Verse [Manny]:
Never out her, money and the powder
Nigga move the shit from Uptown to Crowder
Who got the sprinkle to make yo ass wrinkle?
Dope fiends and O.G's bout to take a tango
Chickens in a cutless supreme, young hoes dream
Cash rules everything in town, know what I mean?
Snowin' like Alaska, wanted in Nebraska
Bitch tryed to testify I straight blast her
K's and the ammo, modern-day Rambo
Got a Glock some rocks and a gram ho
Got a Mazerati bumpin' like Jon Gotti
Red beams on the scene leave a bloody body
I got this shit locked up
Manny Fresh the special man a.k.a. Big Nutts

Chorus
