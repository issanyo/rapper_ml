Who me? I eat sleep shit and talk rap
See my soul coming out of my scalp I bought that
Caught some felony charges
Yea I fought back
Real niggas fuck up
Let me tell you about that
Subtle heat from subtweets
Lil baby I caught that
Me ten tre Trillin you is my dawg
And you know Iâ€™m gone get it
Never fall off, West side get the money
And we got it all
North side still kill it
Just made a call
East side wit a play
We ainâ€™t gotta draw
South side still holdin
Watch a nigga crawl
Best believe I can do it
And I got the balls
Camouflage wit the flag
Iâ€™m chillin in all black
If I ainâ€™t a hot boy
Then what do you call that
Is it common to move crack
Bust nines and use mask ðŸ˜·
Like nigga what you mean
My mission is get bags ðŸ’° ðŸ’°

Hot hot ðŸ’¦
Hot hot ðŸ’¦
Hot hot ðŸ’¦
Oh yea
Hot hot ðŸ’¦
Hot hot ðŸ’¦

Bitch fuck! Iâ€™ll bust yuh ass up
I ainâ€™t worried bout the
Guns or the handcuffs
Where I been Made a man
Made a man tough
Ima laser like the taser
Get yuh hands up
All they said was young man
Get yuh bands up
Downloaded studio
Wake the band up
Ludacris you can sit
Ima stand up
And my ex still a bitch
I canâ€™t stand her
Still give you hardwood
Like antlers
Bitch I said Iâ€™m serious
Like cancer
Oh I heard you a model
You a dancer
Really I just learned Yoga
Was the answer
With them pants
Iâ€™m like lady where yo manners
Cause you a star and you spangled
Like them banners
Tell them hoes Gods watching
Ned Flanders
Iâ€™ma call it Grimey Season
Cause itâ€™s dabber
If you really want that bitch
You can have her
On to the next one
Thatâ€™s a laugher
I was thinking bout some rings
Like Saturn
Ainâ€™t thinking bout no nups
That shit sadder
This is real world ðŸŒŽ
Like Seattle
Iâ€™m a warrior
All about a battle
Niggas talking bout beef
Yâ€™all the cattle
I been moving like
The snakes with the rattles
Just to eat you alive
