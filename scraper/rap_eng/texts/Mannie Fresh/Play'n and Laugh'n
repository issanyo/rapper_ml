[B.G.]
I try to maintain keep my head straight
But my surroundin' Niggas want half weight
So what the fuck all I see in here is negative heads peeled
I ain't got to many postive relatives people
Try to tell me right from wrong but man I think
I'm grown I ain't resepctin no nigga cuz my daddy gone
I'm on my own so let me be all the B.G. I'm gonna be
Its an possiabilty I might see a key off Valence
Street all I want is green in my hand I ain't gonna
Say nothin' because shit doesn't always go as planned
I'm gonna do what I do wit my hustlin skills cuz I know
Somewhere out here they got a mill I'm gonna get it
I ain't waitin on the bitch to come to me
If that's the case I be waitin til eternity
I'mma struggle and strive drink some wine
I'm Doin bad thas fine I got my hand on my nine
You bests believe I'm goin to get mine
You can take this to the bank nigga I'm gonna die tryin

Chorus: B.G

But if ya want somethin do what ya got to do, Gee out chea
