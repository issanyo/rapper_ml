(Hook)
Do it [3x] what u waiting for
Do it [3x] what u waiting for
Do it [3x] what u waiting for

Now Lemme hear you say
Big Things poppin' and lil things stoppin'
Big Things poppin' and lil things stoppin'
Big Things poppin' and lil things stoppin'
Ball on these suckas shorty loser's not an option

Do it [3x] what u waiting for
Do it [3x] what u waiting for
Do it [3x] what u waiting for
Now Lemme hear you say
Big Things poppin' and lil things stoppin'
Big Things poppin' and lil things stoppin'
Big Things poppin' and lil things stoppin'
Ball on these suckas shorty loser's not an option

(Verse 1)
Do it to the maximum, take it why you asking them?
Don't listen to them suckas when they say you too irrational
See I said I'm king and them lames started laughing
Same sucker now I want the king on the track
I composed several classics
U know like top back, dope boys
Bring em out, and what you know about that
Now they ask how I talk what you know about that
Dominated '06, now I'm going right back
See me reign hell, at a show just like that
Even Denzel'll say damn, I ain't know it like that
Yeah, still Bankhead you can tell
Ain't nothing changed but the name on the mail
Still kicking doors with them thangs in the air
Up in Benihana's, see me slang in dem chair
I will slang caine, no such thang as a jail
Said you need a hundred squares they just came off the scale

(Hook)
Do it [3x] what u waiting for
Do it [3x] what u waiting for
Do it [3x] what u waiting for
Now Lemme hear you say
Big Things poppin' and lil things stoppin'
Big Things poppin' and lil things stoppin'
Big Things poppin' and lil things stoppin'
Ball on these suckas shorty loser's not an option

(Verse 2)
Do it like a ball playa, when you see me ballin
Stacks tall- ball playa from the stage to the air
Whether in Miami, Cincinnati or in Riverdale
Arizona, California, make it rain anywhere
Pullin that in public shorty who you think u finna scare?
I send a missiles at ya have ya going in your underwear
I tote a pair, fortyz on me, so you better tone it down
I suggest you juss prepare yourself for when it goin down
A-town, west side club, you should catch me
Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro & Mac be
Jackers lying say they caught me slipping how could that be
I'm something like a stalker I be everywhere the strap be
The trap be, jumping with that 100 dollar slab
If I wanted I could get 100 on the tab
Sell em all double down do the math
Think I won't pull up in something with 200 on the dash

(Hook)
Do it [3x] what u waiting for
Do it [3x] what u waiting for
Do it [3x] what u waiting for
Now Lemme hear you say
Big Things poppin' and lil things stoppin'
Big Things poppin' and lil things stoppin'
Big Things poppin' and lil things stoppin'
Ball on these suckas shorty loser's not an option

(Verse 3)
Do it like I wanna do it, do it right in front of you
Real vision pimpin I ain't seeing none of you
I do it for my partner Phil's daughter and his momma too
Do it for my oldest sons and they Grand momma too
Do it for my daughters and my youngest son momma who
Go buy what she want becuz she know it ain't a problem to
You do something to them and it's you I bring the drama to
You do it for a day or so, we do it for a month or two
I do it for my partner go make show them stuntin too
We do it with them plakas(?), ain't no problem where you running to?
We do it for the block, that why ain't nobody stopping me
I do it for my pop, and my cousins too they watchin me
I did it nonstop, now see how these rapper copy me
I made it from the bottom to the top, where I oughtta be
Who do it did good, and do it different
No matter what I do you know I do it to death
