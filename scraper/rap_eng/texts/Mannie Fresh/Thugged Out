Wusup, nigga off top (off top)

I'ma lil' nigga that will down you
Let off fifty rounds at you and
If you fake I don't want to be no where around you
I'ma Head Buster, Tru Hustler, a real nigga and
Believe I'd never get caught without my steel nigga
You want beef with me, I'ma do ya somethin' wrong
I'ma empty seventeenth bullets straight off in yo dome
I'ma Hot Boy, recognize or get chastised
Disrespect my mind, if ya want, ya gone die
Cause it's like that, only way I know
How to play it, I'm all ready
Wanted by a triple murder by the Feds
So I'ma get me a brick, break it down to all O's
Sell 'em for six, to let my cliental roll
Buy four more ki's sell two, and sit on two
Cause I heard, through the wind, they got a draught comin' through
I'ma hit me a lick off in that UPT
Tax them nigga's I want thirty a ki

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Nigga I'm thugged out
You want to find me, I'm hustlin'

Everybody I serve, I serve holdin' a gun nigga
Click, ready to bust nigga, click I'm thugged out

All I know how to do is thug , hustle, and kill a nigga
If I gotta, if I don't know ya, don't trust ya
Shit's in me to be a rider
Assault Riffles I got 'em
Stacked up in the closet
If ya out of line I'ma stop ya
Ch-Ch-Ch Chop Ya!
You know me, I'm off the block
On my side keep a Glock
Find me in a corner house, runnin' a Quarter Shop
Police got my picture, on they dash try'na catch me
But fuck, they can kiss my ass, I'm bout Feddi
Thugin' is all I remember that I've been doin'
Every since I came out the womb, I've been booin'
Runnin' with straight killers, guerillas, and real niggas
It's kill or be killed with me, you know the deal nigga
My price stay right, that's why my shop stay hot
Whatever ya spend, ya gonna double it off top
Ain't nothin' in this World, you bout I ain't bout
B.G. is gonna be forever thugged out

[Chorus-2x]
[b.g.]
Told you before, I'm bout trigger play
So you can come my way
If ya want, get a clip, emptied in yo face
I'ma donkey nigga, you don't want me nigga
To tie you up, and throw you off, in my trunk-e nigga
Call yo wootay's let 'em know I'ma keep ya nigga
To they cough up sixty gee's my nigga
That's how it go, cause if the shoes
Was on the other feet, nigga wouldn't hesitate
To snatch me, and call be , so fuck that
I gotta Get It How I Live and
In this bloody streets, that I live on it's real
So I gotta play it raw, cause only the strong survive
So it's a must I sell them first, and grab them thing's and ride
If I don't, nigga gonna jump in they shit and smash out
Try'na catch me slippin' and leave Geezy ass out
But it ain't gone happen cause believe I know how to think
I'ma shoot a whole in yo boat first, before mine sank

[Chorus-2x]
