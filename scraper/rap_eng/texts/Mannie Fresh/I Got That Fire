[Verse 1: Juvenile]
You need a nigga that stay sharp, always got money
Pockets stay full of them big-face hundreds
A nigga with tattoos all over his arm
A nigga with a gold grill, diamonds in his charm
A nigga that'll tell your girl, "Fuck that nigga!
You're givin' me tha pussy, you don't love that nigga."
You need a nigga that'll put you in your place
Put the dick on ya at any time of tha day
A nigga that'll give ya a lil' somethin' if it's right
A nigga that you may not see for three or four nights
A nigga standin' tall like tha Statue of Liberty
A nigga on fire like a match and a cigarette
A nigga that'll take care of his kids if it's his
A nigga that's a handsome lil' son of a bitch
A nigga like...me...never get tired
You're lookin' for a Hot Boy, girl, I got that fire

[Chorus: Juvenile]
Shit, I got that fire, I got that fire
Girl, holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer
Shit, I got that fire, I got that fire
Girl, holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer
Shit, I got that fire, I got that fire
Girl, holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer
Shit, I got that fire, I got that fire
Girl, holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
Some old ghetto-face, blue-hair, funny-ass lookin' bitch
Was tryin' ta holla at a nigga; talkin' some bullshit
I told her, "If ya fuck everybody, it's all gravy."
She didn't say nothin', she stood there lookin' at me crazy
Then she got mad, and called me bitches and motherfuckers
I waited 'til I got by the door, reached back and snuck her
She did what any bitch woulda did, and got the law for me
Talkin' 'bout go and press charges and get her pa for me
I told 'em, "When I get outta jail, I'ma beat ya awfully
And open up fire at your pa to back him up off of me."
All she wanted to do was scream out "Juvy"
While I hit her from tha back and smack her on tha booty
Bite tha titties, get tha head, break tha bed
Pull off tha rubber and bust a nut on her leg
Some of these hoes be tellin' me, "I'm just an admirer."
I don't wanna fuck ya - shit, I got that fire

[Chorus: Juvenile]
Shit, I got that fire, I got that fire
Girl, holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer
Shit, I got that fire, I got that fire
Girl, holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer
Shit, I got that fire, I got that fire
Girl, holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer
Shit, I got that fire, I got that fire
Girl, holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer

[Verse 3: Mannie Fresh]
(eerie, eerie, eerie)
Look, baby girl: work it, just don't quit
See, I love it when you young ass shake them tits
You lil' vivrant thang
You like Burger King?
Well, you can go 'head and swing on tha Whopper Ding-a-ling
You make me really lump up in tha pants
Every time I see your sexy ass do that dance
And you can tell your friends you know a
Nigga with a dick like a great big cobra
We can bang, bang, bang all night long
Knock your head against tha bed 'til tha inside's gone
When ya see your sister, tell her, "It's alright."
She still make my dick BOOM like dynamite
Tell her Tiger would, but I won't...
...eat no pussy, cause I don't
You want a nigga that'll fuck ya in tha park in tha grass
You want a nigga that'll stick a big stick in your ass
That fire!

[Chorus: Juvenile]
Shit, I got that fire, I got that fire
Girl, holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer
Shit, I got that fire, I got that fire
Girl, holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer
Shit, I got that fire, I got that fire
Girl, holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer
Shit, I got that fire, I got that fire
Girl, holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer
Shit, I got that fire, I got that fire
Girl, holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer

[Outro: Juvenile]
He got that fire, fresh, he got that fire
Girl, holla at my nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer
He got that fire, Jean, he got that fire
Girl, holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer
He got that fire, B.G., he got that fire
Girl, holla at that nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer
He got that fire, Turk, he got that fire
