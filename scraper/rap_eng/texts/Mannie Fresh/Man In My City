I'm the man in my city, my city, my city, my city, my city
I'm the man in my city, my city, my city, my city, my city

[Verse 1]
I'm the man, shawty ride with a player
Woke up feeling so good, I think I might run for mayor
Hop on the band wagon, all aboard
I'm the shit in my city boy
Ask with them boy afford, watch my city hold me down
They like how I get it in
Fact told me hold it down, so I gotta represent
I'm just a poor boy from the land of poor boys
But now they be like oh boy, cause I'm getting dope boy
Soldier let me see your teeth, smile at a g
Man we just got out of church
Why you mean mugging me
Could it be because I'm clean
Could it be because I'm fly
Up early in the morning, I jump shy
Feeling fine till the broke days, yeah I hope they hear me
I see them haters out there, yeah I know they hate me
And even if buy 30 cribs around the globe
I ain't never moving, like black people at rap shows

[Hook]
Phone ringing off the hook, everybody wann talk
Same hustle different day, it ain't nothing to a boss
Used to steak and genim rise, but now they riding with me
Just ask around about me, I'm the man in my city
I'm the man in my city, my city, my city, my city, my city
I'm the man in my city, my city, my city, my city, my city

[Verse 2]
I'm the man, I'm the legend, I'm the king, I'm him
One thing I'm not brah, I'm not like them
I am great, I am good, still the best so far
I'm the whole universe and you just a star
See I'm riding round and I'm getting em
Pickin em up and I'm splittin em
Feed em fries and tell em lies
Send em home, forget em
If you shit ain't graduated, I got money allocated
Get your bitch together, bring em to me baby I'm gonn pay it
I do stool laws, paint homes and all types of trickeries
If you tryina eat, go and cheat, drop this dick and get with me
I got the biggest budget, I got money for days
Ain't nobody in this city fucking with me

[Verse 3]
Can't call me autumn in every circle and different color
You players learning the hustle the way I been discovered
Boy I make love to that paper, I'm a business lover
Without a rubber, now she friendly for me
Went to the bank the next morning
And she started a line of credit for me
I got the product but the kind with no serial numbers
I hit the block and they look at me like a miracle coming
I got belief the day I come from a spiritual woman
And I know I'm not alone, I got serious opponents
Party over here, just me and my killers
And boy you can't see nothing less we in the picture
I say we in the picture like cheese
All the women be like juve and we spend the night please
Lil magnolia so the reason why I tease
I'm the man around these thangs, they love my swagger like the breeze

[Verse 4]
I'm the man, yep I'm the man
Just came home, and that's what my whole city say
Reunited with the block, it feels so good
3rd wall magnolia, I'm so hood
I could around on any block and anything
With my jewelry and my shirt I'm taking much respect
I'm an og my young niggas call me young
Play with me if you want that come and chop...
You want his head bust, plenty bands I spend on
Nigga I ain't to talking, check my background
Been a... homie I'm from uptown
I'm not an industry nigga I be in the street
Same place where the gangsters and the killers be
Creep, bloods, vice lords, nigga and the g's
If you looking for the man, catch me in the streets
