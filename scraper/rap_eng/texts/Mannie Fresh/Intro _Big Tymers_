[Mannie Fresh]
Straight off the project steppa
Nigga, hot like pepper
I fucked your ol' lady last night, then I left her
That pussy was a fool, I wish I woulda kept her
Niggas in the hood sayin' I'm a repper
But I bet cha', neither one them niggas gone check a Hot Boy
No your not, boy
Your heart pump Kool-Aid
Watch out, you'll get chopped boy
From the hottest, of the hottest of the hot fo
Project hoes, scatterd sites, and whole block see ya
Baller Blockin', standin' in my way
Cash Money, Hot Boy$ bout their presidents everyday

[Baby]
Since we got papers, the feds be tryin' to stop us
I'm playin with millions, fuckin uptown poppers
Goals and hoes
Niggas doin videos
Fuck Versace, Reeboks, and Girbauds
I bought a Hummer that's sittin'  32's
Fuck stun'n, we givin these hoes the blues
A mouth full of gold, diamonds on my whole crew
Rolex to show we done what we had to do
So muthafuck you nigga, and yo' whole crew
Ca$h Money Records bitch we be com'n through
So show love, Baby, Mannie, and the whole crew
