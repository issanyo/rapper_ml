[Verse 1]
Christina waits on tables
At Clarabelle's Cafe
Now she's waitin' on a bench for Johnny
At the end of another hard day
Hey, hey, he just got paid
For washing all them cars
They ain't goin' to the movies
And they ain't goin' to a bar
They gonna pick up the keg
I'm gonna pick up the ice
We're gonna show you how the experts
Kill us a Friday night

[Chorus]
We drive out in the country
To set something on fire
Is that an ice cold beer on a tractor tire
Underachievers look different than the rest
'Til we're burnin' up the moonlight
Chillin' on a hot night
That's what we do best
We ain't nothin' special
We ain't no big deal
But if you wanna throw a party in the middle of nowhere
We're outstanding in our field

[Verse 2]
Well everyone except for David
Was passed out in the grass
Somebody grab me a sharpie
He's about to grow a mustache
Sam's already dancing
Turn up the radio
Kenny's always got some moonshine
If the keg starts running low
We're all pyromaniacs
This place about to blow

[Chorus]
We drive out in the country
To set something on fire
Is that an ice cold beer on a tractor tire
Underachievers look different than the rest
'Til we're burnin' up the moonlight
Chillin' on a hot night
That's what we do best
We ain't nothin' special
We ain't no big deal
But if you wanna throw a party in the middle of nowhere
We're outstanding in our field

[Verse 3]
We can take a hundred acre big old empty pasture
Life is so fun
And turn into the hottest weekend nightclub spot from here
To Sunset Boulevard
That's just who we are

[Outro]
No we ain't nothing special
We ain't no big deal
But if you wanna throw a party in the middle of nowhere
We're outstanding in our field
