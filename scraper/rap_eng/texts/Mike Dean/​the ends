[Intro: Travis Scott]
2AM, howlin' outside
Lookin' but I cannot find
Don't you fall asleep this time
I been on a long way drive
Only you can stand my mind
Only you can fix inside
So if I make it out tonight
Let's make it a badass time

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Okay, I got it, copy
20/20 but I can't see nobody
One eye open, Illuminati
This might be the verse that make 'em drop me
Ain't makin' friends, we just makin' hobbies (yah)
No, that weren't my girl, that was just a hobby (yah, yah)
Call up 50, tell 'em load up the lobby
Elevator up, no need to find me, yeah, yeah
X-ray vision, see through you niggas
Newspaper stand, we press the issue (press it, press it, press the issue)
We ain't sendin' shots, we launchin' missiles (yah)
Right up at your hood up north
Checkin' Third Ward, I'm goin' mental
Fuckin' up my room, I've been rackin' up incidentals
Cookin' on a tune, I've been cheffin' up instrumentals
Nothin' else to do when you're ridin' in the
When you ridin' in the, in the back of the back seat
(Back seat, back seat, back seat, back seat)
Driver run the miles up like I'm runnin' a track meet
(Track meet, track meet, track meet, track meet)
Gotta watch my back now, 'cause these niggas at me
All black in a Benz when I pull up on you

[Hook: Travis Scott]
They don't want to see me in the ends, in the ends
Let me catch you creeping here past 10, in the ends
From a tribe of check-a-hoe like Indian
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Andr√© 3000]
Eh, to them I'm a big dick, a cheque and some laughter
I guess it's all survival but please be careful
I gave up on the Bible long time ago
Oh, I hope it ain't give up on me, I don't know
I came up in the town, they were murderin' kids
And dumped 'em in the creek up from where I live
Bodies, bodies, bodies sprinkled around
We runnin' through the sprinkler lookin' around
Killer would show up with boxes of pizza
And said he had a label recruitin' people
Put that on my grandma and everything
Yeah, my homie said he told 'em his name was Wayne
It could've been me or could've been you too
What a memory in me, needing to lose (could've been me)
What's gon' patch up my inner tube
So I could pop a wheelie and walk it too

[Outro: Travis Scott]
Oh, yeah, La Flame with the nappy fro now
Yeah, in the ends, I'ma kick your door down
Oh, yeah, we keep wildin' out the Mo' now
Oh, yeah, keep that 300 Z-Ro when I pull up on ya
