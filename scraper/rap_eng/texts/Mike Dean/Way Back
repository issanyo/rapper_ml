[Intro: Flesh-N-Bone]
Oh, yeah
If I could go back, way back, way back

[Chorus: Flesh-N-Bone & Ms. Chaz]
Eazy, Eazy (said Eazy), 2Pac, 2Pac
And Biggie, Biggie and Big Pun
Rest in peace, rest in peace
If I could go back, way back
I'd swoop that nigga E up in my Cadillac
And we could hit a corner, get a fat ass sack
I'm checkin' for the ladies, where ya at?

[Verse 1: Flesh-N-Bone]
Remember that cool ass nigga
True thugs, my nigga, that G that put me on
Thinkin' about it, it shouldn't go wrong
Why would a nigga Eazy-E, he gone
Never really had a chance to say
Thank you for givin' Mo Thug mo love
And now that you laugh and sing on up above
You gotta be laughin'
Niggas we set it off multi-platinum
Stackin my chips, I'm droppin' these hits down every hour
And I been smokin' these weed trees with them sticky leaves
Blaze to the mighty power
Uh, six deep in the Benz-O
6-double-O thug stroll to the studio
Little Lay, Kray, Biz, Wish
Flesh here to rhyme so cold
Rap flow never heard befo'

[Pre-Chorus: Flesh-N-Bone]
As we ride, as we roll, roll
Reminiscin' ‘bout the games we played
Those were the days, those were the days
Never let ‘em slip away

[Chorus: Flesh-N-Bone & Ms. Chaz]
If I could go back, way back
I'd swoop that nigga E up in my Cadillac
And we could hit a corner, get a fat ass sack
I'm checkin' for ya ladies, where ya at?
If I could go back, way back
I'd swoop that nigga E up in my Cadillac
And we could hit a corner, get a fat ass sack
Yes, I'm checkin' for the ladies, where ya at?
Eazy, Eazy (said Eazy), 2Pac, 2Pac (and 2Pac)
And Biggie, Biggie (and Biggie) (and Big Pun)
Rest in peace, rest in peace

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
If I can go back, I'd be me and Stack, hittin' ‘99
Thuggin' it in drawely
When all of this rappin' was really a hobby
Rollin' in a Malibu, mobbin' with Wally
To this day, feelin' like yesterday
When it was Bizzy, Flesh, (Wish), lil' Lay, and Kray
We took a one-way ticket to L.A. Creepin' on a come up
We had to meet Eazy, better believe me
(Eazy, Eazy, 2Pac, 2Pac) Them was the good times
Droppin' them good rhymes, yes indeed
And you know we put it down for the love of the cheese
For the love of the game, and the real O.G.s
For the love of my C's
I'ma let it be known; Hip hop thugsta
Clique tight with the bones
And a war been on since the first song
‘Member them Northcoast thugstas splittin' your dome
Hit ‘em home with "Tha Crossroads"
Dedicated to the lost souls (we reach ya)
Benefit ya, forever we miss ya
Better believe that we'll never forget ya
Take a picture and capture the moment
On a quest for the best, it's victory
Nevertheless, we stress this history
Is you feelin' me, is you hearin' me?

[Pre-Chorus: Flesh-N-Bone]
As we ride, as we roll, roll
Reminiscin' ‘bout the games we played
Those were the days, those were the days
Never let ‘em slip away

[Chorus: Flesh-N-Bone & Ms. Chaz]
If I could go back, way back
I'd swoop that nigga E up in my Cadillac
And we could hit a corner, get a fat ass sack
I'm checkin' for ya ladies, where ya at?
If I could go back, way back
I'd swoop that nigga E up in my Cadillac
And we could hit a corner, get a fat ass sack
Yes, I'm checkin' for the ladies, where ya at?
Eazy, Eazy (said Eazy), 2Pac, 2Pac (and 2Pac)
And Biggie, Biggie (and Biggie) (and Big Pun)
Rest in peace, rest in peace
Eazy, Eazy (said Eazy), 2Pac, 2Pac (and 2Pac)
And Biggie, Biggie (and Biggie) (and Big Pun)
Rest in peace, rest in peace

[Verse 3: Flesh-N-Bone]
I'm sendin' my chrome upside your dome, hater
Disrespect my home, nigga, let's get it on
Fifth Dog flipped out, and it's on
Oh no, y'all testin' the Flesh-N-Bone, you wrong
Too many true soldiers set up for murder, stuffed, unsolved
And it makes me wonder who's really involved
In killin' our prophets
Crossin em off the list, bitches
So we still on the rise, it ain't no surprise
Beat us, so violent, rowdy Mo Thug riders
Eazy said it, real niggas don't die
And if I could go back just one more hour
Swoop a nigga E in my Lex, swerve, hit a couple corners
Get a fat sack, smoke out with some pretty hoes
Where y'all at?

[Pre-Chorus: Flesh-N-Bone]
As we ride, as we roll, roll
Reminiscin' ‘bout the games we played
Those were the days, those were the days
Never let ‘em slip away

[Chorus: Flesh-N-Bone & Ms. Chaz]
If I could go back, way back
I'd swoop that nigga E up in my Cadillac
And we could hit a corner, get a fat ass sack
I'm checkin' for ya ladies, where ya at?
If I could go back, way back
I'd swoop that nigga E up in my Cadillac
And we could hit a corner, get a fat ass sack
Yes, I'm checkin' for the ladies, where ya at?
Eazy, Eazy (said Eazy), 2Pac, 2Pac (and 2Pac)
And Biggie, Biggie (and Biggie) (and Big Pun)
Rest in peace, rest in peace

[Outro: Flesh-N-Bone]
This is for my homies...
