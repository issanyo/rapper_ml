[Verse 1: Mekado]
Break in the spot with my dog when I get the check gotta cut it
I been wildin' in the mall when I get some bread I say, "Fuck it"
You see the field under destruction
Just for some money she fuckin', her friend interruptin'
Done fucked up her weave, now she leavin' lookin' rugged
Fuck with my niggas, them niggas, they don't want for nothin'
No key for the V, I get in and push a button
Got liquor in my system, I been drivin' like a dummy
Drinkin', I'm drivin', but I'm still trappin' for the money
Thuggin', I'm buggin' but I'm still trappin' for them hundreds (hundos)
Bust a couple licks and then I bounce back like a bungee
Pray to the Lord I end up on the side where it's sunny, uh
My only option is to make it, I come from the dungeon
Fuck the police, man they crooked
Fuck around and catch a bullet
Tired of sleepin' in the bookings
Niggas talkin' like they 'bout it 'bout it if he got it we pull up and book 'em
Me and my niggas so rowdy rowdy that I'ma pop out and throw on my hoody
I come from my goons

Smokin' Jew kids, Jewish people
You be talkin' 'bout the news people
You be snitchin' on me, tellin' on me

Tell the preacher come and preach with me

You be talkin' cold lean with me

I be wildin', I go Jungle Men
Niggas'll kill for a couple bands
Just grindin' hard I made a hundred bands
Like I went viral, got a hundred friends
Bossin' on 'em, couple Gs got me flossin' on 'em
Really come from the mud on 'em
They be flexin', put the slug on 'em
Couple of hitters'll kill for whatever
Just for the paper she's doin' whatever
Now Iâ€™m feelin' better
But if I was locked she probably wouldn't send a letter
Got it on me movin' militant
No time for the middle men
Clip a nigga got 'em moon walkin
Got real shooters, and they ain't talkin'
Just do it, nigga, shit, I'm tired of talkin'
Got the Ghost I was tired of walkin'
Dope got a nigga Zombie Walkin'
Ain't tryna have my mommy walkin'

Ridin' 'round with my tool nigga
Bicken' back bein' bool, nigga
Couple fool niggas ain't cool nigga
