[Verse 1]
Saturdays involved making our entrances into life outside
We've been in this room too long
Recreation is keeping us self contained and aware
Of each other's forms
Still and in full strides just the same
Keeping us warm
Walking in straight lines
Talking to sleep at night
Coddled and pacified
By versions of mothers

[Refrain]
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around the Higgs

[Verse 2]
What if we decide to live by choice?
All this time I knew
That average was something to fall back on after genius ends
I watch video only difference is flattened and remiss
Sparks of lightning storm behind wet faces
Slipped my pants back on and rewind it backward more
The tape stopped before I was back alone

[Bridge]
I'll be back before
The street lights on, before the daylight's gone
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts
They don't compare, no not at all
And had this been the past I might not know
What to do with all
Of what you've showed
What you give, my words canâ€™t hold
And if acts of God break us apart
Least we did ours

[Outro]
Turn back, turn back
Turn back, turn
Back, turn back, turn
If you've never been in love
