[Verse 1]
Aye, Polos
Everything I'm wearing is some polos
Ralph Lauren is a fucking motto
Solo
All this new game is so dollo
All I wanna do is meet Cole though
All I wanna do is just float oh
Just float oh
Just float oh

Everywhere I be so tropical
These bitches think that it's capital
Got to sleep
These nights are cold
These nights are weak
Effects so neat
Effects go speak
My mouth just leaves
My brain just meets
Me me my myself
These bitches just want my sex
I don't need that (5X)

[Verse 2]
All these niggas actin like I'm dumb
I ain't finished nigga I have just begun
Had to switch this shit up on you like a gun
Gun means fun
And fire means run

So tell me what you need
You need to be free
Only key to your mind
It's down in your heart

Yeah It's down in your heart
You know what that mean?
You are the free one
You are the free one
You are the free

(Being Free Speech)

[Verse 3]
Um, yeah
I already had my chances
I already blew them, yeah that's right
It's time i'm coming back again
I fall down every time I just can't (Shit)
I like my city late at night yeah
That's when all the freaks are coming out, yeah
We never go up in the sun
I got my boys up in the cut

Uhh, uhh
