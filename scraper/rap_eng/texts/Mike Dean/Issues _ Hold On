[Intro: Sample]
I do love you but it's-
I do love you but it's-
All alright

[Verse 1]
Fighting to keep us together, hope it's worth a try
You ain't always been an angel but heaven's on our side
I got my demons too, I know just how you feel
You can be real with me, that's why you're still with me
Can't hide behind the carats on a diamond ring
I don't even care if you lie to me
Cause there ain't much that gets by me these days
I ain’t say, “I do” just to say, “I don't”
Don't give me no reason to go through your phone
This is deeper than you and other women, this is daddy issues
This is years putting up with the wrong type niggas

[Chorus]
So hold on, hold on, don't let me go
Hold on, hold on, hey!
So hold on, hold on, don't let me go
Hold on, hold on

[Verse 2]
You tell me you love me, well tell me again, yeah
I need the reassurance every now and then
Love ain't a game full of X's and O's
But I done been played before, I played it safe before
Gave it up to somebody who didn't deserve my body
You gon' have to lend a shoulder, help me kill this hangover
I believe your love for me exceeds the needs
And you gon' take responsibilities
On my healing, how I'm feeling
Don't go trading years that we put in

[Chorus]
So hold on, hold on, don't let me go
Hold on, hold on, hey!
So hold on, hold on, don't let me go
Hold on, hold on

[Outro]
You think I'd leave you sad, baby, you know me better than that
You think I'm laying down, way down on your knees, baby
I wouldn't do that, yeah
