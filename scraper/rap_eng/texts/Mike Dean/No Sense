[Intro: Justin Bieber]
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
The sun don't set the same
'Less you're watching it go down with me
The bed won't sleep the same
'Less you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart's a vacant house
When you're gone away, it's so empty
And love don't make sense when it's empty (Oh no)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've driven almost every car
It ain't the same when I'm without you
Been around a million stars
None of them shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
Oh been around the world
Ain't the same without you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Focus ain't the same
If the picture ain't got you in it
In every line my
Emotions ain't the same
If it ain't about you, I don't get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, oh
I mean that so literally
Don't nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber (Travis Scott)]
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
'Less I'm doing it with you baby
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
I only want to hear your voice, yeah
Oh, been around the world
Ain't the same without you
Had to find out the hard way
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Going way up, way up)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Way up, way up, way up)
(Yeah, slow down stay up, stay up, stay up)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Time and time again I break a plan
Without you, girl I ain't the man
Could never be all I can be
You overstand, I'm incomplete
Apparently, gotta know I hate that
How I'm supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that
Thought by now you would have made it back
Be patient
Won't you pull up to me now?
Live forever young
Itâ€™s amazing
I don't want to sleep 'less you at home

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, It don't make sense
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, it don't make sense
It don't make sense
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Alright, yeah, alright)
