Intro
[Willie D]
Special request, ha ha, going out to all the hoes out there
Ha ha, oh! I ain't just talking about the females
You know, it's a lot of niggas, that have ho like qualities
Just peep that shit, I suppose they mad at the clothes
Cash flows, ha ha

Verse One
[Willie D]
Look at these haters, pulling me over, in my 'Gator
Dirty fuckers, they ain't nothing but some Cock suckers
Fifteen rolling through the B-Nickle
And everything's working on my V-Hickle
I'm sick of all you motherfucking, crooked cops
The minute you pussies see me ya, you make the block
Checking out your screen, hoping I ain't clean
Mother fuck your guns and your badge and ya sirens
All my cop homies, I gotta recognize em
Not only do I know my rights, I exercise them against
You motherfuckers that abuse your authority
Ain't no pressure to bust a cap in your ass cause you ain't special
You breathe like me, you bleed like me, from slugs
So why you mean mugging when I come in the club?
What you jealous of? - the jewelry, ha ha, the money, the car?
Don't hate me cause I'm paid homeboy

[Chorus: Scarface]
Niggas been playa hating me, like some hoes
Been talking about me lately, like some hoes
That's how it is when you live majorly, I suppose
Throwing shit all up in my Bentley, ya'll some hoes

[Verse Two
[Scarface]
I met her hanging out at a sports bar, posted up
Nigga off in training camp, flossing in his Expedition
Thinking he can change a tramp, but see, she on a mission now
Checking out my stone blocks
Earrings, Rolex, wedding band, it don't stop
But now we making contact, eye to eye, she's smiling
Bleached white shinning, fat ass just'a profiling
Now I'm out on the grinding, finna to get her paper work
Game tight to a science, we're both involved, let's make it work
Took her to a restaurant, admiring the 512 Testarossa '92
It's a Old School but oh well, headed to a private spot
Get her out the Parking Lot
Nigga, must be knew the broad, what this nigga talking bout
He gonna tell her boyfriend, what the fuck is that gon' do?
Long as you don't fuck with me, I ain't finna fuck with you
Burning up her cell phone, leaving hella call notes
I'm listening to you hatin man, man this bitch is all throat

[Chorus]

Verse Three
[Devin]
I'm just minding my business, officer what is this?
Don't shoot me in my kidneys
I just came from my gal crib and she's talking shit
She said somebody's been calling her, some old stalking bitch
Who said I fucked her, and left her, she reminds me of you
Who always run behind me, whining feelin blue
So is why would you fucking with me, while I'm tryin to chill?
You think I'm selling crack, from a '79 Seville
Just got an open can of beer and it ain't even kicked in
You've been following me, fucking with me every since 610
I'm just trying to go and see my very close good friends
Who calling up on an ounce and I'm finna pitch in
So, I'm just, rolling, car not stolen
Keep it tight white and the Vogue stripes golden
Hoping, freaks will get inside of my Lacville '79
But you keep hating on me

[Chorus]
