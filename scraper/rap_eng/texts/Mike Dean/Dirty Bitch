[Foul mouthed girl yelling at Bill on the phone]

[Bushwick Bill]
You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear
Gotta start with the right material, to generate a useful idea
In other words, you can't turn a ho into a housewife
Try it, the bitch'll make you sock her in her mouth twice
It started out beautiful, but you was playin possum
To me, you was just a fuck, but our relationship blossomed
Got attached to
Your kids, I loved 'em like my own
I loved 'em like my own
Referred to your daughter as my daughter, your son as my son
Called you my
Wife, even if it was common law
Never saw a better creature in my life
How could the one who stole my heart
Make me reach for my knife
(Why you reachin for your knife?) Cause I'mma stab that bitch
(What if they
Take your freedom Bill?) They can have that shit
Now she wanna be friends -
Ain't that a bitch?
Fuck you bitch, I hate you bitch!
I wouldn't care if you burned in a fire

Crashed in a plane or got hit by a motherfuckin train
You make my life a livin hell, the sun's out but it's dark
You're the devil
All you need is a pitchfork
I'm too short to take shorts
I'm havin seconds thoughts, the ride's too scary, I gotta get off
I wish I
Never met you ho
I wanna hang you from a fuckin cliff and let go, you dirty bitch

[Hook 2X: Bushwick Bill]
Why you wanna bring me down
Why you wanna bring me down, you dirty bitch

[Bushwick Bill]
I once believed that I could save you, emotion was squandered
Now go back to that fuckin rock you crawled from under
I did more fo' yo' kids, than they sorry-ass biological father ever had
That's why they called me dad
Your own momma used to tell me not to fuck wit'cha ass
I messed around and got you pregnant, now I'm stuck wit'cha ass
I gave you everything I had, didn't have to be forced
Why the fuck you wanna take a nigga to court? You dirty bitch
Tell me this, who paid the medical expense
When your kids was sick, suck dick you fuckin whore
Burned my car and my clothes, like you were Angela Bassett
I left town, you moved out, all you left was the mattress
Now I'm hearin that you had another man all the while
When I see you I'mma
Beat your ass, so go 'head and file
I can tell by your tone you think it's funny bitch
Where the fuck is my money bitch? You ain't runnin shit
I'll hook you up like your kidneys failed
You think I give a fuck about sittin in jail?
You think I don't know the
Ghetto streets are bumpy?
And you're the reason why them niggas tried to jump me?
At first I was cool with the split
But you keep, callin my new bitch, bein
Messy and shit
You can't stand to see me happy, with or without you
Had to rain on my parade, it was all a charade
You triflin slut, ain't worth a cigarette butt
I shoulda left you where I found you, waitin on a bus
Wanna drag you to a field and chop you up to the bone
You ain't worth the fuckin ground I walk on, you dirty bitch

[Hook] - 2X

[Girl on the phone mouths off 'til Bushwick breaks in]

[Bushwick Bill]
Yeah, take this bitch, uh-huh, yeah motherfucker yeah
Yeah, yeah you fuckin, yeah bitch!
Yeah you fuckin..
