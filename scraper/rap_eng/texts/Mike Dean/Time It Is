[Chorus]
Aye, spent twenty bands on a new watch, they don't know what time it is (don't know what time it is)
Walk in the club, give me all ones, then she know what time it is (she know what time it is)
Rockin' some lean with racks in, they call me the designer kid (call me the designer kid)
I'm in [?], so I had to decline a bitch (had to decline her)
You know I had to decline a bitch, hold on, let me remind you, bitch (remind you, bitch)
The clothes that I got on imported, know you can't find the shit
(can't find it)
Exotic whip with the seats massaging me, I'm reclining it (reclining it)
They know what time it is (they know what time it is)
They know what time it is (they know what time it is)

[Verse 1]
Spent twenty bands on a new watch, walk in the lot, buy the new drop
Still ridin' dirty, got a whole zip in the pint, so I'm dodgin' from the cops
Diamonds wet, yeah they feel like some mops
I just got off the phone with my pops, he say you gotta give it everything you got
Jewelry on me, lookin' like Dippin' Dot
L[?] just got him a new Glock, woke up got some new guap
Said she wanna chew cock, pocket rocket in my tube sock
I just broke down some moon rock (moon rock)
Smokin' California while I'm gettin' California love like I'm 2Pac (2Pac)
I'm just a icey young fella in the new Gucci, I feel like I'm Guwop

I swear Dice SoHo be flyer than a muhfuckin' Pelican
You niggas' steady [?] like some bitches, that shit is irrelevant
I know they schemin', tryna watch all my moves, so I move like the...

[Chorus]
Aye, spent twenty bands on a new watch, they don't know what time it is (don't know what time it is)
Walk in the club, give me all ones, then she know what time it is (she know what time it is)
Rockin' some lean with racks in, they call me the designer kid (call me the designer kid)
I'm in [?], so I had to decline a bitch (had to decline her)
You know I had to decline a bitch, hold on, let me remind you, bitch
The clothes that I got on imported, know you can't find the shit

Exotic whip with the seats massaging me, I'm reclining it
They know what time it is (they know what time it is)
They know what time it is (they know what time it is)

[Verse 2]
In the back of the 'Bach with a hoe, fake ass, fake titties (uh)
Left hand I'm styrofoam cup, right hand on the kitty (yeah)
In the face real pretty, bad bitch from New York City
She seen it all, she sure did it

All she wanna do is molly and coke, I just wanna [?] doja
She blowin' my mind, I'm blowin' her doja
Outside, it's a Ghost with a chauffeur
Old bitch thought I wasn't gon' make it, look at my now, hoe, I told you (I told you bitch)
Blow the money like it ain't nothin' to me, I'mma throw through that shit til' it's over (it's over)
Hunnid bands wrapped in rubber bands and the Gucci bag around my shoulder (racks)
And you know the whole gang with me, I don't go nowhere without my soldiers (Icey Life)
Grow the hardcore OG on the West Coast, [?] (gas pedal)
Every week we at Boa[?], [?] to the bitch, I hate bein' sober
Hit [?]

[Chorus]
Aye, spent twenty bands on a new watch, they don't know what time it is (don't know what time it is)

Uh, rockin' some lean with racks in, they call me the designer kid (call me the designer kid)
Uh, I'm in [?], so I had to decline a bitch
