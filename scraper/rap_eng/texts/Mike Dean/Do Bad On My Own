[Verse 1:]
I remember situations as an adolescent
I couldn't roll with the homies they'd rather see a nigga steppin'
Was it cause I was a "school boy" tryin' to get my grades together?
Stayed on the same block but we never played together
All of a sudden, why they wanna come and kick it with Ro?
Thinkin' they can get free cd's and free ticket's to show's? no!
Pay at the door or you stuck out
And if you get in, don't ask for nothin' or get escorted the fuck out!
And say lil' mama I ain't tryin' to go to bed with ya
You smokin' thinkin' I'm about to be breakin' bread with ya
Keep my money in my pocket, never leave it with ho's
Put a ring on my own finger cause I sleep with zero
I love my enemy's more than friends that's why I treat'em so friendly
Cause they let you know they hate you, but a friend hides his envy
Ain't no use in flaggin' me down while I'm out on a creep
If I'm stoppin', my gun's cockin' you droppin'
I live and die one deep!

[Hook:]
I don't need no help, my nigga,I can do bad on my own
And I don't need no company lil' mama, stop ringing my cellular phone
When I be down and out, nobody wanna come and kick it
I'm a nobody until I can shine
So when the money is long, I don't need nobody to visit
Leave me lonely like you did last time

[Verse 2:]
It's the same, every day. every day is the same
Dealin' with fraud ass fellas I swear it ain't gonna ever change
Even speakin' on the hood, nigga the hood ain't shit
So when you see me I'm a speak, but that's as good as it gets
But ain't no ridin' with me, gettin' drunk, or gettin' high with me
Ten out of ten I bet you would never ride and die with me
All my drugs are for personal use cause I be stressin' bad
Poverty and pain is all I've ever had
I remember I was down in the dumps no one lifted me up
Niggas said I would never make it in music cause i wasn't gifted enough
So why the hell would I chill with y'all?
I'd rather deal with felony charges before I have to deal with y'all
It's one cup, one sweet cause it's Z-ro only
Forever lonely I don't need no phony homey's all up on me
Cause when niggas get to trippin' with their and shit
For me, I bet my homey's won't empty a clip
I live and die one deep!

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
It was hard to dream when I was hooked on codeine
Killin' myself slowly on purpose cause humans made me nervous
And I knew I'd have to kill one, one day
Then how could I sit up in front of the Lord come Sunday?
That's why I eat by myself and I sleep by myself
I'm alone twenty-four seven I'm out here on my own
Plus I'm confident that I would never jack myself
For all I know, homicides are homey's watchin' as I stack my wealth
When I was trippin' with my steel pointed dead at my grill
All my "real niggas was laughin'". didn't try to tell me to chill
I ain't ever had a friend like Joseph
Cause he don't give a damn if I ever was on a poster
A skinny ass never had a penny ass nigga, treated like a food stamp
Till I dropped a few jams now they diggin' a nigga
It's plain and simple to witness
If it wasn't for rappin' who'd give a fuck about my business?
Let me live one deep!

[Hook]
