[Chorus: Young Thug & Travis Scott]
Call your friends, let's get drunk (let's get drunk, ay)
Call your friends, let's get drunk

Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & Young Thug]
Twelve more hours left for us in a day
Call your friends and let's get drunk
I've been drinkin' all day, I've been floatin' all day
Call your friends and let's get drunk, hey
Bring your ass over here now, you know where, how I stay
I've been gone for some time now, I just want a lil' taste
Mix it, mix it, pour (lean, lean)
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Drinkin', sippin', slow
Call your friends and let's get drunk, hey
Drink so cold now, froze
Froze, froze
Come on over, get drunk

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber & Young Thug]
Damn, girl, I'll be up late
If you want, you can meet me at the studio
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Yeah, I've been drinkin' all night
Take a shot, all we got is Don Julio
Call your friends and let's get drunk, hey
Yeah, I'm guessin' this is new to you
Thinkin' 'bout all the things that I would do to you
Them lips on fire and them hips don't lie
Girl, I just wanna see what that booty do
Let's lose each other's mind
Let's make each other's night
Take advantage of time
While we're both intertwined
Girl, I want you on the rocks, no chaser
Be sure to drink it all, won't waste ya
I know you stay sober
I'm sure a few drinks won't faze ya

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Call your friends, let's get drunk (hol' up)
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Caress lil' mama for weed and she did it for free
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Yeah, that thing wet, baby, I need skis
Call your friends and let's get drunk, hey
Skrrrt! Yeah, I need to skeet, yeah, ohh (ay)
Run it back from the track (ay)
Then I'ma speed race in that, skrrrt!
Lil' mama still got my back, ay
Pull down your pants, I want crack, yah
I'm growing weed, this ain't trees (bitch)
My bitch brown like Hennessy (bitch)
Big blood like Freddy in dreams (bitch)
Dressed in a tie like the Dean (bitch)
Drunk and in love with my baby
Baby, do not go fast, go slow, wait
Tell me, tell me information, I got rank (tell me)
Let's take a shot together then lay up like planks (ay, ay)
Never ever do I wanna leave my little lady (ay)
Patrón down, back down, they got a plan for that boy wake (yah)
Told God if I get a iced out watch I won't be late (I promise)
Every time I try to stick it in all the way
Baby girl be like "ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ay, ay"

[Chorus: Young Thug & Travis Scott]
Call your friends, let's get drunk (let's get drunk, hey)
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
