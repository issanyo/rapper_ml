[Verse]
I-I-I be on it all day
Like my nigga Big Boi said
That's the only thing that keep me level
Up in my crazy head
Stoned on the run-run
No fun if not
It's Scotty from the email read
Man, I swear to keep it one hundred
And if I ain't have it, then I'll be dead
My soul's been fed tonight
Everything that I choose
Still can't forget Grey Goose
Converse covered with mixer juice
And all my niggas rolling up in the booth
Who got me on another one?
Someone please roll me another one
They tell me all good things must end
But those motherfuckers ain't have this friend
I keep

Pretty green bud all in my blunt, oh, I need it
We can take off, yeah, oh, marijuana, yeah
Pretty green bud all in my blunt, oh, I need it
We can take off, yeah, oh, I know you wanna smoke
