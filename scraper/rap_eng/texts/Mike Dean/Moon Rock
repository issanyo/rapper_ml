[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Been poppin'
Foldin' this money, can't make a knot, how not?
High on moon rock, jaw still locked
After 12 we hit the gate and flood the spot
Six of them are thots

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
No lights, wrist ice, it blinds
Closet the mall, we buy whole thing
Big gas, it's lit, propane
One hit, one touch, La Flame
Know that you niggas never liked me
Know that you niggas sit beside me tryna slide on my sidepiece
Tint all through the whip, I hope it can hide me
Tip all of the bitches, I don't want no funny business, don't want them to try me
They wanna slide in my IV
Ran 12 red lights, 12 behind me
Paparazzi flashes wanna deprive me
Hypnotized, I cannot let it blindside me, no
I'ma live and die by my Migos
Why I'm startin' to dance, what in the hell did you hand me?
Took all of my niggas off Xans, put all of my bitches on Plan B

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Been poppin'
Foldin' this money, can't make a knot, how not?
High on moon rock, jaw still locked
After 12, we hit the gate and flood the spot
Six of them are thots

[Verse 2: Quavo]
6 AM these thots (thots), 6 AM my watch (watch)
She got that red dot (woo), kick her out the spot (gone)
I pay my bills in cash, cash, cash, cash, cash (cash)
Run it up, you do the math, math, math, math, math (run it)
Nawfside, have them Migos serve you slabs, slabs (brrr)
Runnin' to that money, you can see it in my calves
Huncho, Huncho Jack, we get that pack then hire staff (Huncho)
You want your bitch, can't get her back, oh yeah, it made me laugh (yeah)
I've been geeked all week (geeked), pourin' drank to sleep (yeah)
AP wet, it leak (AP), Huncho don't need keys (Huncho)
Press one button, they bleed (blood), ain't no dodgin' me (nope)
Ain't no flaugin' me (nope), you owe, pay your fees (ho)
I was taught to break it down and serve 'em all (serve 'em all)
Now I'm fishtailin' out the mall (skrrt skrrt)
Heard we got that bag, so tell 'em all (tell 'em all)
Oh yeah, tell 'em all
