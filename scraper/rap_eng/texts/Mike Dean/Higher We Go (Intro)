[Verse 1: Quavo]
I'ma put these racks in your face
In your face, show you that you lame
I'ma stash these M's at my place
In my place, but no I'm not the bank
I'ma pull that coupe out to race
Who wanna race? We livin' that fast pace
I'ma pull these hoes, I don't chase
Hit these hoes, get 'em right out my face
I'ma pull the strap close case
Hit a nigga hard, send him dat way
I'ma put the gang on your plate (gimme the plate, ayy)
You can't eat on my plate (no eatin')
Mount it up like the horse on Raris (yeah, skrrt, ayy)
Beat that pot like Ortiz, yeah (beat it)
Two feet runnin' from the feds (yeah, 12)
All these niggas lookin' like they scared (yeah, pussy)
Lock a fuck nigga like these dreads (yeah, pop 'em)
Pick a nigga off for that bread (yeah, hey)

The higher you go (go), went through the most (most)
We get to fly, you float (float)
No Malone, but I post (Malone)
Migos, you know we the goats (goat)
Bag of bread, call it loaf (loaf)
I shoot at that boy, then reload
Walk in the trap in the soul (walk)
Come to my jeweler, get froze (ice)
Snatch your soul
Come to the north, then we snatch your gold (snatch)

Flooded my wrist, it's soakin' (flooded)
Split up the waters like Moses (split)
I done put furs on the loafers (fur)
Rolls Royce nightmare, I'm a ghost (Rolls Royce)
Let's have a codeine toast
Niggas ain't gettin' no stain on me
No drip, don't trip, my gang with me (don't trip)
Come to the bando, stop playin' with me (bando)
