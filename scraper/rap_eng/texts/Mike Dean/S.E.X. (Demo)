[Intro]
Sex, what you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?

[Post-Chorus Variation]
Oh my God, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my God, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed
(Oh my God)

[Verse 1]
When you read my mind, get down and discover me
I'm an open door, let you come inside of me
Want to put my hands around your neck
Gonna take you to a place that you will not forget

[Chorus]
Sex, what you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh my God, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my God, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed
You got a bad attitude, I like to grind it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want, baby
Oh my God

[Verse 2]
Oh my God, let me clean your wound
I can be your nurse, got the antidote
Please show me where it hurts
Can you be my father? Tell me what to do
You can punish me and maybe I will punish you

[Chorus]
Sex, what you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh my God, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my God, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed
You got a bad attitude, I like to grind it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want, baby
Oh my God (God, God, God)

[Bridge]
There's no shame in feeling
As long as it feels right (oh my God)
Our love, this is natural
There's nothing wrong with, nothing wrong with

[Chorus]
Sex, what you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh my God, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my God, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed
You got a bad attitude, I like to grind it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want, baby
Oh my God

[Outro]
What you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex
