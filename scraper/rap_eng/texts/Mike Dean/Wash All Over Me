[Verse 1]
In a world that's changing
I'm a stranger, in a strange land
There's a contradiction
And I'm stuck here in between
Life is like a desert, an oasis to confuse me
So I walk this razor's edge
Will I stand or will I fall?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Turn a blind eye
Try to pretend that nothing is what it seems
Torn between the impulse to stay
Or running away from all this madness

[Chorus]
Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end, then let it come
Let it come, let it rain, rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me

[Verse 2]
All of my illusions
Could be shattered, in a second
You can thread a needle
With a teardrop from my eyes
It's a cruel injustice to be witness to the things I see
Looking for the answer
When it's right in front of me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
From the Tower of Babylon
Where nothing is what it seems
Gonna watch the sun going down
I'm not gonna run from all this sadness

[Chorus]
Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me
Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me
