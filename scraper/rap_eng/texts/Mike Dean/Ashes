[Verse 1]
Late at night is when I think of you most
You're on my brain, on my brain
Thought that I gon' give up the ghost
But in you came, in you came
Like some fucked up rainfall
There's only so much I can take
Hard to breathe with your hands 'round my throat, oh

[Chorus]
Light up a fire
Ain't no burying you and me
Flames getting higher
Can't throw our ashes to the sea
Keep our heads underwater
Desperately wanna
But I can't drown the memory of ya
The harder I try, yeah
Still no burying you and me

[Verse 2]
Knowing inside I'm a block from the coast
I'm on the edge, on the edge
I'm in knots on the end of your rope
Get out of my head, of my head
Fighting for my survival
I can't lay this love to rest
It's at night when I think of you most, oh

[Chorus]
Light up a fire
Ain't no burying you and me
Flames getting higher
Can't throw our ashes to the sea
Keep our heads underwater
Desperately wanna
But I can't drown the memory of ya
The harder I try, yeah
Still no burying you and me

[Bridge]
Try to stop, I try to leave
I guess that's just some fantasy
Gave my heart, so naive
But now you're just the death of me
I try to stop, I try to leave
I guess that's just some fantasy
I gave my heart, was so naive
And now I'm just...

[Chorus]
Light up a fire
Ain't no burying you and me
Flames getting higher
Can't throw our ashes to the sea
Keep our heads underwater
Desperately wanna
But I can't drown the memory of ya
The harder I try, yeah
Still no burying you and me
