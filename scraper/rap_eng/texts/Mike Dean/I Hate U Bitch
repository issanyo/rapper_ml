Shit this your boy Z-Ro
Fucking with Mike Dean, at www.thesenuts.net
We ain't gon sweat

[Hook - 2x]
I hate you bitch, I hate you bitch
I hate you bitch, I never thought I'd say

[Z-Ro]
Too many years, I done paid the price
Why you gotta put all this, drama in my life
And day after day, I'm on the grind for you
Living lavish drape you in karats, what I'm trying to do
But Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii'm, just a man
Trying to do all I can, but you act like you can't understand
Well I done sacrificed, and I done swallowed my pride
On the wrong road, trying to follow my pride
I was daddy for a while, though I've got no seed
But the kids, are my H-E-A-R-T
I've been dealing with a lot, so I've been losing my mind
Straight up acting before I think, barely using my mind
My freedom is on the line, and my sanity's gone
You picked a fine time to leave me, now this house ain't a home
I had no problem being faithful, I loved you so much I hate you
Because you left me, when I needed you the most
So now a bitch, is how I rate you
My female friends, making you wonder
Guilt got you feeling suspicious, from when you was creeping on me
On the under, but even still I held my head
Five kids and I fed em all, with more than bread can spread
Them was my motherfuckers, treated em like sisters and brothers
But somehow I fell out of place, fucking with they punk ass mother
I apologize, I wish I can turn back the hands of time
Wishing we could pillow fight, just one more time
But Ms. Ronda, wanna put them laws in my life
Although I'm happy, I never pictured you not at all in my life
Solo that's how I kick it, the rest of my days
But I wanna thank you for making possible, some of the best of my days
I've dried my eyes, now and all they can see is the greed
You can have that jury, broke ass motherfuckers the seventh scene
