[Verse 1]
I keep walking
I keep talking to every cute girl I see
I keep looking
I keep searching for the girl that you used to be
'Cause before all this

[Chorus]
You were lovin me, hating me, tell me you're my baby
Calling me, telling me, everything that you have just been through
And I'd say, okay my baby, everything will be alright
I'll never let you out of my sight, 'cause I will hold you in my arms
And I'll hold you so tight

[Verse 2]
Been searching for a girl like you
'Cause no girl has got me through the things that you've got me through
We used to talk every day and night
But now when we're talking it don't feel right
It don't feel right

[Chorus]
You were loving me, hating me, tell me you're my baby
Calling me, telling me, everything that you have just been through
And I'd say, okay my baby, everything will be alright
I'll never let you out of my sight, 'cause I will hold you in my arms
And I'll hold you so tight

[Post-Chorus]
Be, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Be, yeah, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

[Bridge]
You said that maybe we should hang out soon
You said "meet me at your house at noon"
I waited there, you never came to see me
That's why I want the girl that you used to be, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You were loving me, hating me, tell me you're my baby
Calling me, telling me, everything that you have just been through
And I'd say, okay my baby, everything will be alright
I'll never let you out of my sight, 'cause I will hold you in my arms
And I'll hold you so tight

[Post-Chorus]
Be, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Be, yeah, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Hmmm

[Outro]
I want the girl you used to be
I want the girl you used to be
