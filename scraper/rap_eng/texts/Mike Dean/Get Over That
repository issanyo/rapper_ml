[Chorus]
Get over that shit, look over that shit
Prepare yourself to run into some more of that shit
Get over that shit, look over that shit
Prepare yourself to run into some more of that shit

[Verse 1]
I ain’t trippin’ off these bitches, ‘cause lessons in life are free
And have yet to find a muthafuckin’ wife for me
Take for instance, Ebony
She had to be the finest hoe in H-Town, but she wasn’t the one for me
She was the friend of a hoe that knew from way back before named Tanya
I wanted to run up inside her, but unfortunately
I never had the chance to run my dick through her muthafuckin’ panties, dude
And I never choose to lose, to play the game, I only wanted to
Be a muthafuckin’ man but she couldn’t understand
So I had to X her ass out the plan
Three years later, and now I got a record out
I’m hanging, outta character, she wanted me to check her out
But I didn’t, I dissed her, ‘cause she was old news
But her friend with the attitude was so cool
Pardon me, can I have your number? I was bashful
How could I not be when baby had an ass full satin panties
In between her ass cheeks, got her number
(Did you hit it?) No need to ask me
We kicked it for a couple of months and everything was shiny
Until the hoe couldn’t find me
Ran behind me, even though she wouldn’t admit the shit
We fell out of love, so I had to quit the bitch
And it woulda been like any other hoe but it was complicated
Baby was kinda tight so I hesitated
And instead of getting my roll on
I was a stupid muthafucka and got hurt tryin’ to hold on
I only wanted to be there for you and care for you forever, fool
Forever, fool, we folded
I was fuckin’ over her and somebody told it
And all she coulda said was, “Damn, I shoulda known it”
And me being the nigga that I am, I realize that I’ve blown it
Tryna be the mack over here, huh
And got hit with the payback of the year
‘Cause when it came to mackin’, I thought I wrote the book
But the book ain’t tell me shit about the shoe being on the other foot
Take a closer look, we used to be on
But now it’s all gone anyway

[Chorus]
Get over that shit, look over that shit
Prepare yourself to run into some more of that shit
Get over that shit, look over that shit
Prepare yourself to run into some more of that shit
Get over that shit, look over that shit
Prepare yourself to run into some more of that shit
Get over that shit, look over that shit
Prepare yourself to run into some more of that shit

[Verse 2]
So it comes down to this, another heartbreaking moment
Our feelings got hurt, we’re feeling pissed, nobody’s being missed
‘Cause even though I like to bone you, baby
Your attitude ain’t worth about shit
So I’ma say ‘bye-bye’ to ya, rather than lie to ya
Packin’ up your shit without giving a reason why to ya
‘Cause you chose to play me rather than please me
Now you cry ‘cause you don’t wanna leave me
Well, baby, here’s a tissue, look here
No, I won’t miss you, don’t cry on my shoulder, I don’t wanna kiss you
You shoulda thought about it before you did it, huh
But you didn’t, so I had to end it
And, I meant it, ain’t no gettin’ back
I’m 86’ing your ass like that
‘Cause ya, used to be a sweet thang
But now you gotta hear me sing
About your ass, so bye-bye, love
Your smile was pretty, but your attitude was shitty
So shitty to the point where you can keep them gold rings
Huh, know what I’m sayin’?

[Chorus]
Get over that shit, look over that shit
Prepare yourself to run into some more of that shit
Get over that shit, look over that shit
Prepare yourself to run into some more of that shit
Get over that shit, look over that shit
Prepare yourself to run into some more of that shit
Get over that shit, look over that shit
Prepare yourself to run into some more of that shit
Get over that shit, look over that shit
Prepare yourself to run into some more of that shit
Get over that shit, look over that shit
Prepare yourself to run into some more of that shit
Get over that shit, look over that shit
Prepare yourself to run into some more of that shit
Get over that shit, look over that shit
Prepare yourself to run into some more of that shit
