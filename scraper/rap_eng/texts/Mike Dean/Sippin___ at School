[Intro]
BOB$: Bobs!
Chill B: Chill B!

[Chorus: All]
Sippin at school

(X4)

[Hook: Chill B and BOB$]
I’m sippin at school, fill my cup with lean. Throw this shit in the trash, what the fuck you mean?

[Chorus]

I’m sippin at school, fill my cup with lean. Throw this shit in the trash, what the fuck you mean?

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Chill B]
Beat game crack
Dick game black
Got a bitch, eat my apple, word up to Mac
You know this be a hobby
Spit all up on my knobby
Put this rap game to sleep, I ain’t talkin Bill Cosby
Bitches be dead
Someone get them a bed
I don’t wanna watch you twerk
I’m just tryna get head
I’m on a fucking roll
I don’t ever pay the toll
Put this dick in your bitch, she said “That’s the wrong hole!”
I had to say sorry
She keyed my new ‘rari
Pull out game strong, just ask my man Maury
Jump out the black car
Spit a couple bars
I’m high outta this world, meet me on mars (ooh)

[Verse 2: YungBryceGod]
We sippin at school
I got the lean on deck
Chill B left B-Dubs without paying the check
But it’s bool, he finna pay the price
And you know I fuck bitches, I lay the pipe
Got Vans on my feet
Just took a xan
But sippin that lean is the fucking plan
We out here
Just tryna get it right
And you know we smokin gas, high as a kite
Yo bitch just dropped down on her knees
YungBryceGod the only boy she tryna please

[Chorus]
(X3)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: BOB$]
I’m sippin at school, I said fill my cup
I ain’t even lyin bruh she ate my nut
I’m sippin at school, man this work is light
Got a codeine pool, shoutout foolish night
I’m sippin at school I’m higher than a kite
Making hits all day and all fuckin night
I’m sippin at school
Fuck a pie crust
Sippin at school is a motherfucking must
