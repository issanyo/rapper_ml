I wake up every morning to a song called history
It always seems to ring, it never really seems to miss a beat
It's always in the streets, my people call the sound their misery
Two hundred something years and we still can't get it off repeat
Or press delete
But there's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words and listen when I say that we are blessed
Compared to Box Brown, our struggles are far less
Yet even he found beauty in all of this mess
Days in a box with nothing to eat or drink
Days in a box with nothing but joy to think
Days in a box? I think I'd rather be dead
But when he got free listen cause this is what he said:

He said there's beauty in the struggle ugliness in the success
Hear my words and listen when I say that we are blessed
Fast forward to civil rights, It's still gonna be clear
In the face of segregation, hope was till there
Sam Cooke, Nina Simone, Marvin Gaye
Odetta, Staples Singers, Belafonte
Listen to their music I swear that we'll be okay
Our people will keep on moving
We'll make it to a new day
And I know there's countless times
Where we thought we couldn't last long
But listen to Sam Cooke, I promise we'll carry on
They might want us off their campus
Or want to see us in jail
But with two hundred years of struggle
Ain't no way that we can fail

We got our hair
We got our head
We got our eyes
We got our ears
We got smiles
We got laughs
We got heart
We got tears
We got the life
We got the life
We got the life
We got the life
And I heard it from K Dot
I know that we'll be alright
