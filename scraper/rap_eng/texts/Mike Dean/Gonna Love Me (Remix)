[Intro: Randy Cain & Ghostface Killah]
Damn
And oh, you're gonna love me
I don’t understand why we go through this over and over and over and over again
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
What’s really good

[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor & Ghostface Killah]
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean (True)
We do things in between the lines
We should do more than stand out (I agree)
I'm sorry if I made you feel less than who you are
A little insecure, oh, you's a shining star

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Ghostface Killah]
I wanna spend my nights with you (Spend my life with you too)
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me 'til whenever I get home (Of Course)
I know that you're all alone
Thinking 'bout what you gon' do
I hope that you see it through, ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus: Randy Cain & Ghostface Killah]
And oh, you're gonna love me
I'ma love you regardless
You're gonna wanna hug me
We just gotta cut this shit out
And squeeze me
Yeah

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Yo; We used to spin back Lovin’ You, Minnie Riperton
The Bose speakers had my walls and the plaques tremblin’
“La la la la la” played in my mind all day
You come home, I let Calgon take you away
Bubble baths arose, Gucci open toes
Sunday nights we sit and watch Power in our robes
All of a sudden our lines got crossed, over nothin’
A text and your attitude changed, yo, you buggin'!
Hit me in the face with a pillow and threw somethin’
I just got up and walked in the room, you still cussin’
No, I love you's before we sleep
'Good night's is out the window it lasts for weeks
It’s been a while since I gave you my street vows
Promise to love you and hit it two times a day, never cheat now
Our chemistry is like a bowl of cherries
And I’m the chocolate I smother you, never to worry

[Post-Chorus: Randy Cain & Ghostface Killah]
And oh, you're gonna love me
I'ma take half the blame for this problem we goin' through
You're gonna wanna hug me
You know I’m a Taurus, the bull, I’m stubborn
And squeeze me
So tell me what’s on your mind

[Verse 3: Teyana Taylor]
Sometimes I don't think we really say enough
Why is it so hard to keep in touch
When we're laying right next to each other, baby
We shouldn't read into things so much
Overthinking understanding
Don't let a feeling change it up

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Method Man]
I wanna spend my nights with you
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me 'til whenever I get home
I know that I’m all alone (cash tricks)
I ain’t got time haha
Thinking 'bout what I’m gon' do
Yeah, yeah
I hope that you see it through, ooh, ooh
Look, look, look

[Verse 4: Method Man]
I ain’t got time for tricks, them broads ain’t loyal
I get a Spanish chick, I make arroz con pollo
Keep my woman fresh so she will never be spoiled (Nah!)
And she can be my queen but we will never be royals
I don’t give ya’ cream, ya’naw mean, but I assure you
I’m Heavy with the D, I got Nuttin’ But Love for you
Sex as a weapon, got nothin’ but slugs for you
Ain’t no protection, I done shot up the club for you (pew, pew)
Yeah, If I adore you, mi amor you
These dudes cannot afford you, let the god Couture you
Yeah, I like 'em loyal from the soil
And rhetorical questions when we smash, adorable
Who put the sex in sex appeal?
Shorty got a receipt, but her ex gets the bill
Look, I’m too grown for Netflix and chill
But I G and post up like a net flick for real
Love me

[Post Chorus: Randy Cain]
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me

[Bridge: Teyana Taylor & Raekwon]
And are you gonna love me? yeah
And are you gonna hold me? And squeeze me
Are you gonna love?
Yeah, man
And squeeze me
You know what it is, ma

[Verse 5: Raekwon]
Ay, yo
Chef AKA the wedding crasher came through in the Cullinan
Color of skim milk, the wrath of somethin’
Us in the corner with the paid face, black cards, and Louis faces, African cousins with us, we niggas
Smokin’ blunts, wine, that’s Licatta
I waited like three years, now we here gettin' licenses
I’m tired of the whole Jack and Jill shit, the real shit
Both of us comfortable now, so you don’t ever gotta feel shit
Feed a nigga, laugh for hours
Count my ones, playin’ old school shit while we fuck in the shower
Now you know your guard is top tier
Remember the message, love with capital letters until they dead us

[Outro: Teyana Taylor & Randy Cain]
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me
Are you gonna hold me
And squeeze me, squeeze me
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me
You're gonna wanna hold me
And squeeze me, and squeeze me
