[Intro]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!


[Verse 1]
So I ball so hard motherfuckas wanna fine me
But first nias gotta find me
What's 50 grand to a muhfka like me
Can you please remind me?
Ball so hard, this shit crazy
Ya'll don't know that don't sht phase me
The Nets could go 0-82 and I look at you like this sht gravy
Ball so hard, this sht weird
We ain't even spose to be here
Ball so hard, since we here
It's only right that we be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to be go Michael
Take your pick, Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
Ball so hard, got a broke clock, Rolleys that don't tick tok
Audemars thats losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
Ball so hard, I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
Ball so hard, let's get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
Ball so hard, trip behave, Just might let you meet Ye
Chi towns D. Rose, I'm movin'the Nets to BK

[Hook]
Ball so hard mothafuckas  wanna fine me
That so great
That so great
That so great
Ball so hard  mothafuckas wanna fine me
That so great
That so great (What?)
That so great

[Verse 2]
She said Ye can we get married at the mall?
I said look you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
(Ball so hard, ball so hard), That so cray, Ain't it K?
What she order,what she order?
Your whip so cold, (ball so hard) this old thing
(Ball so hard) Act like you'll ever be around muhfas like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fk ol girl she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French but I'm in France (I'm just sayin')
Prince William's ain't do it right if you ask me
Cause if I was him I would have married Kate & Ashley
What's Gucci my nigga?
What's Louie my killa?
What's drugs my deala?
What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest
Cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in London
And they going gorillas!

[Hook]
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me
Eh!

[Outro]
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Ooh, you are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
I'm definitely in my zone
Oh! Ooooh! Ooooh!
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
I'm definitely in my zone
I'm definitely in my zone

Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me!
