Says shell never see , shell never tweak, now do you really really wanna ride
Wit me?
Now happy here and there ain't now love lost, fitty cars with these bumps
But you others always want some and tell me true or false

Sun up til the moonlight, true dat(true dat), baby but you knew dat

I know you can't see it, but I'm all that

Still ridin in the c-a-d-i double L, double a-c always
