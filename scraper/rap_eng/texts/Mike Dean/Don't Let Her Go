[Verse 1]
When I'm on my knees and it's no degrees
And I'm feeling lost, that's when she comes to me
Alcohol and weed, pills and ecstasy
Every time, that's how it feels when she touches me
Yeah, before she was ugly, I was blind to see
She was just the realest one out there that fucks with me

[Chorus]
Yeah, so don't let her go, don't let her go
I can't always be there, but I want to, I swear
Don't let her go, don't let her go
It's restless over there, but you know they don't compare
Don't let her go, yeah, don't let her go
No one else can compare, I'm bound to stay right here
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Staying in tonight, burning candlelight
Kiss between your thighs, got me on my R&B shit
Even when we fight, I show too much pride
But she'll let me argue with myself, you're a fucking genius

[Verse 3]
My job is too strong, my money too long
Would you still love me if we were just fucking on futons?
If my mama was paying with coupons?
Day in and day out, I'm watching you lay out
My mind is on money, but you what I pray about
Call me your molly, some shit I could say now
Without being away, now
Yeah, let me get out my way now

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
(Don't let her, don't don't let her go now...)

[Chorus]
Yeah, so don't let her go, don't let her go
I can't always be there, but I want to, I swear
Don't let her go, don't let her go
It's restless over there, but you know they don't compare
Yeah, don't let her go, yeah, don't let her go
No one else can compare, I'm bound to stay right here
Oh, yeah
