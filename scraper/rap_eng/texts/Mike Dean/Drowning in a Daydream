There's a question mark in the place of a spark
That used to be an answer
Aiming straight for the heart he missed his mark and
The arrow turned to cancer, no no

Now you get so high that you still can't fly
And you wonder if you're really where you want to be
'Cause the sun don't rise if you close your eyes
And you're sinking low, I thought you'd like to know
Like me, you're drowning in a daydream

[Chorus]
There's a man who watches over me
There's a man where I used to be
Mr. Tambourine play one more song for me
'Cause I gotta leave, I lost what I believed

There's a snake up in the tree
Only hearing what he sees
But the years go by and you don't know why
Did you take it all for granted?

Now you get so low that you can't say no
And you wonder if you're really where you want to be
'Cause the tide does rise and it's no surprise
That it washes you away, now you're far from home
Like me, you're drowning in a daydream

[Chorus 2x]

Daddy's gonna miss you when you're gone
Heavys gonna kick you when you're wrong
Daddy's gonna miss you when you're gone
You got the blues and it makes you wonder
Heavys gonna kick you when you're wrong
You got the blues and it makes you wonder
