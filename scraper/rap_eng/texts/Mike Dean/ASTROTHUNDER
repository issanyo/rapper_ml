[Intro]
High off life, yeah

[Chorus]
Seem like the life I feen
Seem like the life I feen's a little distant, yeah
Seems like the life I need
Seems like the life I need's a little distant, yeah

[Verse]
Light the remedy, yeah
Sit back while I ride the beat, do it on repeat, repeat
Sins controllin' me, yeah
Angels, halos over me, I need blessings and my peace
You been out the streets, yeah
Wildin' on me and all my Gs, we been goin' for a week
Now you wanna peek, yeah
Hands up, why they tryna reach? I can't even get that deep
Told you I don't teach, yeah
Practice, oh, no, never preach
Practice, oh, no, never preach
Infiltrate the enemy, move in on them randomly

[Chorus]
Feels like the life I need's a little distant, yeah (Yeah)
Feels like the life I need, yeah
Feels like the life I need's a little distant, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah-ah)
