[Intro: Takeoff]
Would you, oooh?
Would you, oooh?

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Hey, I know this might sound weird to say (to say)
But would you love me if I ran away? (Away)
I know you probably think I'm insane (insane)
Ain't nothin' change but the pocket change (pocket change)
I know they gotta feel my pain (feel it)
I make them birds Lauryn Hill sang (brr)
And everywhere I go they know my name (and what you claim)
'Cause I be reppin' gang gang (gang gang)

[Chorus: Takeoff & Quavo]
Posted with the gang gang (gang gang)
Pull up wit' the gang gang (gang gang)
Suit up wit' the gang gang (gang gang)
I be reppin' gang gang (gang gang)
I shoot wit' the gang gang (gang gang)
Bang wit' the gang gang (gang gang)
Ride out wit' the gang gang (gang gang)
Always rep the gang gang
Always rep the gang gang gang gang (gang)
Always rep the gang gang gang gang
Whole lotta gang shit, gang gang gang (gang)
Whole lotta gang shit, (ayy) gang gang gang yeah

[Verse 2: Takeoff & Quavo]
She froze up when that Ghost came (Ghost came)
Big body Rolls, it be hoggin' up both lanes (both lanes)
She lift her nose up when she want that cocaine (cocaine)
I lift my doors up, the Lambo, take propane (propane)
After my show we put hoes in the chokehold (chokehold)
At the door, we take cell phones, no photos
Money comin' in, too much I can't hold, truckload
I'm hot, I can't be trappin' in the streets, that what the plug fo'
And all I want is nachos (nachos)
And all I want is Huncho (Huncho)
Pulls strings like a banjo (banjo)
And the keys, a piano (piano)
Take me back to the back door (back door)
I can see my foot on a door knob
Make it back to the gang, that's the whole job
Chop it up and just talk about what we got
(Whatcha got? Whatcha got? Whatcha got?)
Whippin' that Draco (cold, brr)
She said she love me but that's somethin' we'll never know (never know)
Honestly, that's all I really wanna know (wanna know)
Ain't tryna waste my time, it's time to let you go (let you go)
And get back to that back end on the road
I can't go out sad about a hoe (hell no)
Married to the money, I propose

[Outro: Takeoff & Quavo]
Always rep the gang gang gang gang
Suit up with the gang gang
Always rep the gang gang gang gang
I be reppin' gang gang
Whole lotta gang shit gang gang gang
Hit her with that gang gang
Whole lotta gang shit gang gang gang
Always reppin' gang gang
