[Chorus]
I know niggas gettin' bodied in they own hood
Niggas lost they life in that childhood
And I don't wanna lose my life
And I don't wanna lose, and I don't wanna lose
I know niggas gettin' bodied in they own hood
Niggas lost they life in that childhood
And I don't wanna lose my life
And I don't wanna lose, and I don't wanna lose
I know niggas gettin' bodied in that boyhood
Niggas can't divide us in that boyhood
Mama told me "Stay away from no good" (yeah, yeah)
I be throwin' L's in that neighborhood (trrra, git, git)

[Verse]
I feel like a Pharaoh in my neighborhood
I be packin' barrels in my neighborhood
I sing Christmas carols in my neighborhood (Beyonc√©)
I got the right, I pile in my neighborhood
I got up and traveled, uh, uh
I am viral, uh
I know the snakes, they rattle (tsst, tsst)
And I don't like you, uh
I just start to start to moonwalk, uh
Just like I'm Michael, uh
And I live my life right, uh
Like a motorcycle, uh
And I don't recycle, uh
And I am a psycho, uh
Take a plane to China, uh
To go test the rifle, uh
I like fuck vagina, uh
Shotgun, homicidal, uh
Lambo, suicide door, uh (skrr)
I just used the side door, uh
I'm a black disciple, uh
This is so delightful, uh
This is our survival, huh
How we fought the rivals, uh
How niggas came up from the gang-bang just to get the title, uh (trrra)
Livin' in our shoes, uh (git), can't be suicidal

[Chorus]
I know niggas gettin' bodied in they own hood
Niggas lost they life in that childhood
And I don't wanna lose my life
And I don't wanna lose, and I don't wanna lose
I know niggas gettin' bodied in they own hood
Niggas lost they life in that childhood
And I don't wanna lose my life
And I don't wanna lose, and I don't wanna lose
I know niggas gettin' bodied in that boyhood
Niggas can't divide us in that boyhood
Mama told me "Stay away from no good" (yeah, yeah)
I be throwin' L's in that neighborhood (trrra, git, git)

[Outro]
I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin' to see another day
I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin' to see another day-ay
I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin' to see another day-ay
I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin' to see another day-ay, oh
