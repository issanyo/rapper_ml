[Hook:]
She thro it back on my lap, she's a bad girl
She's a Bad Girl (x4)

[Verse:]
She like to throw it back
I like to throw some racks
She know I'm speaking facts
She wanna go and hit the room, she wanna relax
But I know damn well we not gone relax
I'm the simile king, what's happening
All the ladies hit my phone, that shit keep buzzin' (RING RING)
Asian lady hit my phone I said what's going on Ling Ling
Only thing on my mind is my money; I love Cha Ching
I saved the rap game I'm a hero call me Frozone
Chain up on my neck it's wet just like a splash zone
I got ice on both my wrists, bitch I'm froze, hoe
My trap phone booted up wit that rose gold
Her ass is right up on my hand just like a pencil
She's ridin' wit me like she just hopped on a rental (SKRT)
I can tell that she's a kisser by her dental (AYEE)
Ass fat like it's Kylie, Kim and Kendall (AYE AYE)
Chain up on my neck
Jit you know I flex
Damn my wrist is wet
When I shoot it's net
I'm walking loud, cuz I'm loud like a damn band
We can touch but you not gone hold my dam hand (Das a fact)
Shawty throw it back
Imma throw some money, cuz that ass is lookin PHAT

I got some bad girls (x4)
