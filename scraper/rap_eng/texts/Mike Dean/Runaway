[Verse 1]
Now I always find, now I always find  something wrong
You've been putting up with my shit just way too long
So gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I guess it's time for us to have a toast

[Chorus]
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast to the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerk-offs
The kind that never take work off
Baby I got a plan
Runaway fast as you can

[Verse 2]
You found the pictures in my emails
I wrote this guy some letters
I don't know what it is with these males
But I'm not too good at this shit
See I could have me a good boy
And still be addicted to the hood rats
And I just blame everything on you
Least you know that's what I'm good at

[Pre]
Now I always find, now I always find  something wrong
You've been putting up with my shit just way too long
So gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I guess it's time for us to have a toast

[Chorus]
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast to the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerk-offs
The kind that never take work off
Baby I got a plan
Runaway fast as you can
Runaway from me baby
Runaway, runaway from me baby
Just runaway, don't have to be like this
Oh won't you just runaway
Baby I got a plan
Runaway fast as you can

[Verse 4]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take you close to me
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you're at an advantage
Cause you could blame me for everything
But I don't know if I could manage if one day you just up and leave

[Pre]
Now I always find, now I always find  something wrong
You've been putting up with my shit just way too long
So gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I guess it's time for us to have a toast

[Chorus]
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast to the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerk-offs
The kind that never take work off
Baby I got a plan
Runaway fast as you can
Runaway from me baby
Runaway, runaway from me baby
Just runaway, don't have to be like this
Oh won't you just runaway
Baby I got a plan
Runaway fast as you can
Runaway from me baby
Runaway, runaway from me baby
Just runaway, don't have to be like this
Oh won't you just runaway
Baby I got a plan
Runaway fast as you can
