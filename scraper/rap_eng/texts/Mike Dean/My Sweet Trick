[Chorus]
Ya gal ain't hard to find
I be having her in the 'burbon sipping syrup and wine
Doing kinky things on my way to drop her off at your crib
As if you didn't know 'bout what your hoe just did

[Verse 1]
Here's some old pimp shit, coming from a convict
Talking 'bout a long bitch, addicted to my long dick
She had it going on though, long doe and kinky
I asked her did she think we could do the freaky deeky
She said "you got to pay me to lay me and get to know me
And you ain't got no cash cause your ass is a parolee
It take a bit of money for this honey to be jumping
So I'm saying no cause your broke with no funds"
And I see your head is swollen, you think your pussys golden
I told the tramp I was 3-2, we caught up, now we rolling
Thinking about her nose gon' be all up in my asshole
Sucking on my butt, and giving me all her cash flow
Humming a tune I assume was a melody
Cause I know this slut's headhunting
Like a motherfucking Cherokee
So what the fuck you telling me?
Aw shit, your gal in love? That's a wish
She might be your gal, but she gon' be my bitch

[Chorus]
Ya gal ain't hard to find
I be having her in the 'burbon sipping syrup and wine
Doing kinky things on my way to drop her off at your crib
As if you didn't know 'bout what your hoe just did

Yeah playa
And I'm a tell ya something else
About your gal

[Verse 2]
After flipping awhile the hoe wanna go to Motel 6
Where I be fucking most of these nothing ass tricks
Pulled up to Motel 6
And while I'm trying to see who paging me
Yall bitch unpacked my shit got some rubbers and paid for 3
Hours, got in the room took a shower 'fore i fucked, came out
And she was playing with herself and the nut
See, you teaching lessons when  you sexing on them booty [?]
But I'm gon have your tongue licking in and out my dookey chute
Then she took her lips around my pipe and tightly, politely start exciting me
Igniting me delighting me
My legs started shaking making a player unstabilized
Then my nut flooded, into her hazel eyes
She took it and licked it the slut didn't waste a bit
Saying she loved what my cum in her face and shit
So I let her lick all that shit off my thick dick
She might be your gal, but tonight she's my
Trickety Trick
Hitting them streets making a licks
And no matter whatever you do
She ain't gon' quit
Keep me in expensive things
Thousand dollar diamond rings
Cause I'm just a player with a whole lot of game

[Verse 3]
Playa you handcuff your gal
You tried your damnedest you tried your hardest
But a nigga like me was bound to be spanking that pussy regardless
Taking a bitch's mind, and hitting em from behind
And I'm calling them hoes, bitches and sluts, all of the time
And I'm sending her home to you in a rush
To greet you with a big fat kiss of my leftover nuts I bust
A couple of hours ago
When I was up in your hoe
She can't go without it for sure really though
I know you like to live with her proper like
And she likes that sometimes
But also wants somebody to beat the cock at night
Even though you a big baller paid living rich
She might be your gal always but forever be my bitch
