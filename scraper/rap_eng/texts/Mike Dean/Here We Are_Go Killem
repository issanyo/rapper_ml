[Intro: Daz & Kurupt]
Yeah, it's about time I serve y'all bitch ass niggas
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm tired of y'all bitch ass niggas everywhere
Yeah, nigga, Daz and Kurupt
187 killa, every day all day
I'm coming after you

[Verse 1: Daz]
Niggas you better you come strapped with some tactics to get back
Or get capped or back slapped, or laid flat
Swift as a cheetah when them thangs coming to greet ya
In the dark, I won't mislead ya when you're seeing a spark
Dustin' off-brand muthafuckas who start ruckus
Can't touch us, me and homie reply with fuckers
Me and my Doggs blast with intentions, leaving y'all missing in action
Bitch ass, sorry ass bastards
Heartless as a coward, I was born to devour
'Cause it's ours, for all my real niggas behind bars
Scarred for life, from the blade of a knife
They get stripes at 13 for taking your life
Seven TECs, I earn respect, get chin checked and wrecked
Or die when your bitch ass step
I take precaution, stalking these streets, flossing and ballin'
Keep your hand on your heat, 'cause we playing for keeps
Real niggas do real things in this gangbang life we lead
You can't hang, nigga, die and bleed
Murder won't stop 'til every busta and sucka drop
Fuck the cops, won't stop me from corrupting the block
Rocks blast the Glocks in the weed spot
Stop player hating what we got and clock your own knot
Grindin' perfected and shining in 58 karats of diamonds
Blind ya when we come up behind ya

[Chorus: Daz]
Here we are (here we are)
And there they are (there they are)
Go hey-ya hey-ya hey-ya (*shot*)
Go hey-ya hey-ya hey-ya (*shot*)
Here we are (here we are)
And there they are (there they are)
Go hey-ya hey-ya hey-ya (*shot*)
Go hey-ya hey-ya hey-ya (*shot*)

[Verse 2: Daz]
My philosophy's unheard, I choreographered the murder, my morals
I show no mercy or no sorrow
Feudin' and layin' 'em down, forever ready, it's hereditary
Layin' 'em down, dead up in the mortuary
Families mourn, another life is gone
Brandish and torn, 40 weeks later, a soldier is born
Then bomb your neighborhood to let me know if you could
Be a G that you claim to be, let me know if you could
We back shooting up homes and Cadillacs
Don't ever ever come back just to show me where it's at
Off the rack comes the gauge
Bug sprays and AK's retaliate in a major way
We in the land where it's man for man, clan for clan
Simple mistakes, you end up dead
I ride with Crips and dip and dab for the chips
Grip the pistol to your brain, never taking no shit
Whether heaven or hell, I gots to prevail
Rather die making it happen than to die in a cell
Rather load up my hollow point shells for niggas who snitch and tell
Leave their bodies with the maggots and snails
C'd up, fatigued up, always G'd up
On a mission for my tuition, I need bucks
Big dollars, I jack niggas 'cause I gotta
My kids got enemies now because of their father

[Chorus: Daz]
Here we are (here we are)
And there they are (there they are)
Go hey-ya hey-ya hey-ya (*shot*)
Go hey-ya hey-ya hey-ya (*shot*)
Here we are (here we are)
And there they are (there they are)
Go hey-ya hey-ya hey-ya (*shot*)
Go hey-ya hey-ya hey-ya (*shot*)

[Verse 3: Daz]
Smoke unloaded and fucked up, I lucked up
On some niggas who try to get bucked
In a fashion of blastin', it's hard to imagine
And cash in on niggas who be actin' like bastards
What do I do but call my niggas and crew
To come do what they do and put in work on you
Semi-automatic cause static to static
An addict of a gun play, like every day all day
You want drama? Haha, let's bring it quick fast
And Daz'll blast upon they bitch ass
Adios as his ass got smoked
Tthey provoked the wrong nigga now his ass is ghost
I smoke a blunt and stick my dick in some cunt
'Cause to me and my homeboys, y'all just some punks, haha
Who really want it? Nigga, come get it
Slowly but surely, homie, you will never forget it
How many times I gotta say stop fuckin' with mine?
Livin'  a life of crime where it's do or die
Y'all niggas don't really want none of this
We the shit, blow your fuckin' crew to bits

[Chorus: Daz]
Here we are (here we are)
And there they are (there they are)
Go hey-ya hey-ya hey-ya (*shot*)
Go hey-ya hey-ya hey-ya (*shot*)
Here we are (here we are)
And there they are (there they are)
Go kill'em kill 'em kill'em (*shot*)
Go kill 'em kill'em kill 'em (*shot*)
Here we are (here we are)
And there they are (there they are)
Go hey-ya hey-ya hey-ya (*shot*)
Go hey-ya hey-ya hey-ya (*shot*)
(Here we are, there they are
Kill'em kill 'em kill'em, kill'em kill 'em kill'em)
