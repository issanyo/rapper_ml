[Intro: Crystal Caines]
See this is Harlem, these our streets
Hungry Ham, that’s all we
Them niggas out here shining, niggas out here dying
Cause we never got along
We all go getters, we go get it
Some gon’ fake it, half won’t make it
Get a chance to make it out, we taking it

[Hook: A$AP Ferg & Crystal Caines]
Block (Hungry Ham)
Cause that’s my block (Hungry Ham)

Nigga what’s your block? (Hungry Ham)

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Grandma used to call me Mickey Mouse but I’m no rat
On the block they threw a couple bullets, Warren Sapp
Seen my nigga’s family members buggin' off the crack
Your uncle smell like shit like he got garbage in his ass
I’m from 143rd, I come from Hungry Ham, ya heard?
Where the pigs'll lay you down and make a nigga bite the curb
Them kids is poppin’ Percs because they claim it cool they nerves
My crazy ass neighbors sprinkle (hoo hoo hoo ayy!)
Street name was Sterlin, smell like shit, vomit, urine
When my bitches come over they have the look of concerning
Like why he stand in the hallway with a milk carton and be lurking?
Why he jumping for joy when the whole building was just burning?
What about that nigga’s sash? Wore the socks on his hands
Purple coats in the summer, with the Glock in his pants
And he stabbed his own mama, how you do that to your fam?
Cause my block full of lunatics, call my shit Hungry Ham
Damn!

[Hook: A$AP Ferg & Crystal Caines]

[Interlude]
Aunt: Yeah Sharon, I don’t know what’s going on. I seen your son on the corner and he was chillin’ with all of them-
Mom: Ooh, Darold...
Aunt: Yeah! Like he could be a rapper or something like-
Mom: Darold gon' get his ass beat!

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
My auntie ask my mama, “Did Darold quit his job?”
I seen him three days straight sitting on a car
My mama screaming, “Darold, c’mon, you ain’t quit yo job!”
Mama yes I did (Darold! Hoo hoo hoo ayy!)
My mama barking like doggies in front of my aunt and my shorty
I tell her, " I am a rapper", she suck her teeth and ignore me
All she see is my gold teeth with a white bitch and some 40's
I’m getting fame on computers, she don’t think this shit is for me
I used to pray for more women, now I get dozens of oldies
When I be hittin’ it doggie, she bark like hoo hoo hoo!
(Oh my, I’m horny!) Only when you want sex you callin’ me
Tellin’ me how much you want me but I think you’re full of baloney
I ain’t stressin’ you shorty, my shorty be stressin’ me, shorty
Claimin’ I’m messin’ with shorties and be undressin’ them shorties
I ain’t get no head from them shorties
Ain’t be in the bed with them shorties
Now what these condoms for?
And please don’t say these Magnums is for me

[Interlude]
Girl: Are you serious, what the fuck is this?

[Bridge: A$AP Ferg + Crystal Caines]
I'm-I'm-I'm-I’m from Hungry Ham, y'all ought to know
Better get your ass another plan if you want to blow
Can’t play this corner for no more summers if you get my flow
We catching meat, but y’all niggas is buns, hoo hoo hoo ayy!

[Hook: A$AP Ferg & Crystal Caines]
