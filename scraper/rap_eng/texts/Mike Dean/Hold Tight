[Verse 1]
A million miles later
We walked through the valley of the darkest night
We made it through the fire
Scarred and we're bruised, but our hearts will guide us
Together, I know our love's gonna last forever
We're gonna be alright tonight

[Verse 2]
We'll live with no limits
We'll dance in the middle of the freezing rain
With you and I in it
Survive the eye of a hurricane
Together, we're gonna make this better
We're gonna be alright tonight

[Chorus]
Hold tight
As long as you're by my side
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright
Only love, only love tonight
Lights off, we're burning so bright
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright

[Drop]
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna

[Verse 1]
A million miles later
We walked through the valley of the darkest night
We made it through the fire
Scarred and we're bruised, but our hearts will guide us
Together, I know our love's gonna last forever
We're gonna be alright tonight

[Chorus]
Hold tight
As long as you're by my side
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright
Only love, only love tonight
Lights off, we're burning so bright
Hold tight
Everything's gonna be alright

[Drop]
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna

[Bridge]
I don't wanna breathe air that you're not breathing
I don't wanna hear if your heart's not beating
If you hurt, then I wanna be the one that's bleeding
Wanna be the one that's bleeding

[Breakdown]
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright

[Drop]
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Only love, only love tonight
Lights off we're burning so bright
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
