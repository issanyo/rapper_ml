[Verse 1]
Uhh, uhh
Ladies and gentlemen the C-O-double M-O-N
Synonym for fresh, truth is the emblem
Hardcore since I was next door to Clem and them
Cold as the winter when fake niggas was shiverin'
Shakin' in they Timberlands, you as played as Bennigans
Hot for a minute, now you just a "remember him"
I been a master since P was No Limitin
Stick to sayin'
No gimmickin' and no mimickin'
Q infinitin' down old blocks are bendin in
Yellin' "Fuck tha police" like Ren and them
Pelican brief these niggas on who I be
Before the paper and the fame niggas knew Rashid
Noble like Drew Ali
Many have come
But few have been chose to be a true MC
You sing along with it, inside you knowin' it's wack
Young who? Oh, he the openin' act

[Verse 2]
Let, let, le-le-le-le-le-let's go
It's a festival in hip-hop, we do it non-stop
Pop your bottles
Chicago niggas do it in staccato
Choppin' notes for my homies, fuck a motto
And Ferragamo shoes givin' dudes the model
Think fast, drive slow, survival is the throttle
Your live show is hollow, should've kept it local
Rappin' over vocals
Soundin' soft as JoJo
With twelve monkeys on stage it's hard to see who's the gorilla
You was better as a drug dealer
Feel the passion of this B-boy rationale
Half of it is what you say and half is style
I guess it's time for you to start cashin' out
It's over folks, tell your guys to put the glasses down
Masters now, verses touch the youth like a Catholic priest
Performances keep me stackin' the sheets

[Verse 3]
The name is Com I’m like a rebel in rap
Struggle music mixed with weed to make the ghetto react
I know they wanna Resurrect but I ain’t pedalin' back
They gangster stories just as real as Kevin Federline rap
I guess it’s Kramer and Bush that don’t care about blacks
Kinda wish it was some real niggas there that just snapped
Meanwhile in the mean world, hoes cry freedom and fiends url
I’m standing supreme like the Dreamgirls
And I’m tellin you like Jennifer Hudson
The law get outta pocket then I’ma be buckin’
Goin’ against me joe is self-destruction
I’m tired of y'all like my man is of hustlin’
Shuckin’ and jivin', gon’ do that dance nigga
30 with kids pull up ya pants nigga
I ran with the brothers from around the 7
I can tell who’s live by soundcheckin'
