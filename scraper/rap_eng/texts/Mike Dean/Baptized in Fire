[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Mhm
Easy, back up, back up, back up, back up
Turn your radio, turn your radio, off
Watch me now, baby, baby
Uh uh, uh uh

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Bitches in my ear, they saying they love me
Uh, you don't love Scott, you love the Kid Cudi
I ain't no fucking slouch, show you what I'm 'bout
My energy is a bit too precious, too drenched in them blessings
Transitioning to my inner, I'm hearing their voice
Tell me stay in focus, keep focusing, boy
Feeling like a trilli billi
The man everywhere I go, in any city
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls galore
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls adore
Mixing fluorescent to the core of the accoutrement
Off the tippy titty, setting off my groupie radar
Sipping Hen', dapping hands off the roof of my Porsche
A fresh nigga at large, a fresh nigga go hard
All my youngins say "keep it going"
All my youngins, they dumb and repping, they always knowing

[Pre-Hook: Kid Cudi]
Got some pride in your town, I'm spotting 'em lately
Three-piece suit and I'm looking so cute
Sexy mama, send her way, you doing it honey
Them hating fucks sideline and question what you do
Not this, my nigga, you be here (be here)
Not this, my nigga, you ain't here (ain't here)
Big boss, I made your heart heavy (Uh-uh)
Can't stop me, can't carry me, baby

[Hook: Travis Scott]
Life ain't easy sober, we live so geeky (yah)
Did just what you taught us, kept peace, no drama (yah)
Phoned home to the moon, did you change your number?
If and when you get this message, need you back home
Big bro, big bro, big bro, big bro - back home
Big bro, we need you, come home - back home
Big bro, big bro, shit's fucked, come home
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Aye, aye, nightmares kept a nigga from closing his lids
Since a kid, I've been haunted by visions of death
Such a trip, now it's normal, I customed the grip
Think they gone, nah, they just dormant the haunted ain't left
Now tell me what's a young nigga to do
When the zombies are coming for you?
Load up them Daryl Dixons
Survived the rage, turn the page, relaxing, I'm whippin'
Last week I almost weaved right off of Mulholland
Chiefing good like I should, alone in my thoughts
All the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed
Is it worth the paranoia, betrayal, or loss?
Nah nah, heroes can't simply have it all
Sacrifice, but see heroes don't sleep, we hear the call
My nieces know Uncle Scottie is so rock 'n' roll
My princess Vada know rock 'n' roll daddy got the glow

[Pre-Hook: Kid Cudi & Travis Scott]
Got some pride in your town, I'm spotting 'em lately
Three-piece suit and I'm looking so cute (yah)
Sexy mama, send her way, you doing it honey
Them hating fucks sideline and question what you do
Not this, my nigga, you be here (be here)
Not this, my nigga, you ain't here (ain't here)
Big boss, I made your heart heavy (Uh-uh)
Can't stop me, can't carry me, baby

[Hook: Travis Scott]
Life ain't easy sober, we live so geeky (yah)
Did just what you taught us, kept peace, no drama
Phoned home to the moon, did you change your number?
If and when you get this message, need you back home
Big bro, big bro, big bro, big bro - back home
Big bro, we need you, come home - back home
Big bro, big bro, shit's fucked, come home
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
