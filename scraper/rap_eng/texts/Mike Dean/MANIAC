[Intro: St Vincent]
Paint the black hole blacker
Paint the black hole blacker
Paint the black hole blacker
Paint the black hole blacker
Paint the black hole blacker
Paint the black hole blacker

[Talking over Intro]
Yeah
I swear to tell the truth
The whole truth
And nothing but
Yes, hey

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I am the maniac, I am the ghoul (The ghoul)
I'm in the shadows in the corner of my room (My room)
This my new hideaway, this is my tomb (Tomb)
This is my coffin, this is my place for unruliness
No worries; I love the darkness, yeah, I'd like to marry it
It is my cloak it is my shield, it is my cape
I love the dark, maybe we can make it darker
Give me a marker

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
I am a maniac

[Verse 2: Cage]
I am the maniac, I am the fool
I found a monster in me when I lost my cool
It lives inside of me, eating what's in its way
I put black spray paint on my windows during the day
I want to spend time with it, I think I'm losin it
Or I found it and I'm using it
I wear my shades at night so I can look in the abyss
I see something in nothingness if you can picture this
Put black holes in my jar lid, I climb the wall
I'm too high now, I'll die from the fall
Before the water's to our knees, we can't climb when the trees
Wash away, you and I are the disease

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
