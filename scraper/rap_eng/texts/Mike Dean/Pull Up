[Intro: Joey Bada$$ & CJ Fly]
Badmon
Yo, Pow', this a really great beat
Yeah

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
Got my leg up out the window, ay
I'm just flexing if you didn't know, ay
I see stars when I look up, ay (look up)
Niggas talk that talk until I pull up, ay ('til I pull up)
Until I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ay
Until I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ay
Until I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ay
Until I pull up

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Wise man once told me keep my foot on the gas
Never look back
What's on my dash? Never mind that
Movin' too fast, gotta stay on my track
Servin' your hoe, that's a reflex
I'm on the go, I cannot relax
Diamonds and gold in the Rolex
Grippin' on that Glock 4, playin' Russian roulette
Hold up, stay in your lane, nigga never pass me
Fuck 5-0, they will never catch me
Only time I drive slow's for the paparazzi
Just to get a good pic then it's back to godspeed
Hopped in the Porsche, hit the bright high beams
Think about when they tried to kill my dreams
Now the only time they see me, I be on the big screen
Hit a big score now we doing big tings (let's go, yeah)

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
Got my leg up out the window, ay
I'm just flexing if you didn't know, ay
I see stars when I look up, ay (look up)
Niggas talk that talk until I pull up, ay ('til I pull up)
Until I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ay
Until I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ay
Until I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ay
Until I pull up, okay

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Ooh-ooooohhh! (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Ohh!)
I'ma pull up in the new Zonda, all my clothes designer
2018, new Prada, on the yacht like a pirate, ay
Broke niggas still in that Honda, I put that on my mama
Tell that girl come to Bahamas, fuckin' her in her pajamas
I'ma gleam on 'em like King Tut, in the Maserati going nuts
What I'm drivin' is exotic, pull up and I'm doing donuts
See you flashin' all them bucks, you niggas gettin' no love
Leg hangin' out the window, I used to take the bus

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
Got my leg up out the window, ay
I'm just flexing if you didn't know, ay
I see stars when I look up, ay (look up)
Niggas talk that talk until I pull up, ay ('til I pull up)
Until I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ay
Until I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ay
Until I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ay
Until I pull up, okay
