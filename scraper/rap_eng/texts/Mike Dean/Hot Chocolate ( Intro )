[Intro: B A B Y G I R L]
She slips into the room so smooth and sultry
Her narrow eyes sliding from side to side
Her ruby lips are tepid and syrupy
And her skin is dark and sleek as the sky

She is Hot Chocolate
Sensuous smooth and soft
She is Hot Chocolate
An ebony brown broth

The soothing aroma of her stunning presence
Brings out vibrant cafe'au lait emotions
The silky glow of her steamy essence
Pours enchanting amber love potions

She is Hot Chocolate
Rich, dark and warm
She is Hot Chocolate
In exotic succulent form

Her wafting movements are tasted by all eyes
Her soft voice licked in by yearning yielding ears
Who is this woman that no man can deny
Hot Chocolate, whose love arouses inner fears

She is Hot Chocolate
Sweet, lucid and brown
She is Hot Chocolate
Warm desire is her crown
