[Hook]
I'm a monster, I'm a killa
Shotty go pop through the villa
Bunch of 'nana clips'll kill ya
Jump out, the Lord, he gon' feel ya
Let ten fly, the Lord, he gon' hear it
I be ridin' with no ceilings
I'm a monster, I'm a villain
Let ten fly, the Lord, he gon' hear it
I'm a monster, I'm a killa
Shotty go pop through the villa
Bunch of 'nana clips'll kill ya
Jump out, the Lord, he gon' feel ya
