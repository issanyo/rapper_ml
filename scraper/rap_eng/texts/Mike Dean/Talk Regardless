We like two too deep
Up in Club Aces, throwin' dub faces

Bug out with like two strippers
Go eat up with two eaters
That's that new speaker

[Verse 2]
I had to do money, got that new money
Blue face on blue face, that's blue money
Red money, red money, red money, more money
Remember the days of True Religion and rude money
That's that Red Monkey
That's that rilla on 'em

Throw gorillas on
Throw them niggas 'em
Make 'em shiver on 'em
Bullets will quiver on 'em
Choppa go rip up on 'em
Hey, hey

In the Jungle Boogie with like two divas
Talk shit niggas, you ain't do neither
Got them gold bottles and loose litters
