Tonight we'll slide to the future, have the time of our lives
In one night, every night, for the rest of our lives
We're hovercraft fly, lookin' down at the stars
You ain't ever been this fly before
Party like it's '94
And get twisted

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
This a new world, no rules
Hop in my spaceship and let's cruise
See the whole galaxy like we on shrooms
Burnin' all the gas, might get high off the fumes
A couple more toasts of these damn mimosas
I leave her legs spread like she fuckin' Moses
I leave her back bent a lil scoliosis
Lift off, hit the perc, hope I don't swerve
Mayday, mayday
Make a lil' cheese, your pockets need to gain weight
We gon' to the stars, I took her on a play date
Where they're speakin' a language that nobody can translate
She see the Earth then froze
If you scared of heights, then baby keep them eyes closed
Feelin' like Biggie cause this money ain't a thing
Might need more champagne so niggas can make it rain

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Tonight we'll slide to the future, have the time of our lives
In one night, every night, for the rest of our lives
We're hovercraft fly, lookin' down at the stars
You ain't ever been this fly before
Party like it's '94
And get twisted

[Bridge: Kanye West]
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Been grindin' all day so it's good for the night though
Workin' all weekend so I might blow
Don't worry 'bout it, even if the light's low
Cause I threw on the 'Giela like a light show
I need more bottles, more flames
More with my whole gang
I do it cause we do it
Buy everything that we all drink
It's strange when your niggas turn fake
A dime never weigh another weight
Models on models, they 'bout it, 'bout it
The bitches, bitches on top of my world
My world at the top of it
Bill me them niggas that's poppin'
Coppin', they scared of them trenches
Got homies with homies in Heaven
Them niggas existin'

[Hook: Roscoe Dash & Travis Scott]
Tonight we'll slide to the future
God level in my section over here
Have the time of our lives
Bitch don't look at my section over here
In one night, every night
Clap, make it rain, clap when they bring it back
For the rest of our lives
It be like stack, after 'nother stack, we get after that
We're hovercraft flym lookin' down at the stars
You ain't ever been this fly before
Party like it's '94
And get twisted

[Bridge: Kanye West]
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Tonight we'll slide to the future, have the time of our lives
In one night, every night, for the rest of our lives
We're hovercraft fly, lookin' down at the stars
