[Hook: Vic Mensa]

10 toes on the ground
Paper chasing I been running
841,000 black men in prison right now
I gotta go and get this money
So we all be straight
I'm going Vertical
Everything up, up, up
And I'm down for my niggas yeah
Straight up that's vertical
You know how we hang, hang tough
Gang Shit

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]

Lane switch, lane switch, with the paint drip
Double cup and that gas, that propane shit
Fire burning through my veins, drinking tiger blood
Bitch I feel like Charlie Sheen, fucking them tires up
Feed the streets they getting hungry, like where the album at?
They want that shit any means necessary, Malcolm X
Savemoney Malcolm X, and my team's necessary
That's my true religion, fuck your genes it's hereditary
Shooters in them [?] with the secretary
Monica Lewinski on the Bible (Good Mother Mary)
I'm calling out to God, "It's me, Vic, can you hear me?
Please Lord protect me from this jealousy and envy"
And all these sirens in the streets they trying to tempt me
They wanna turn me to the beast you know that's in me
That's Pandora's Box, I don't give a fuck bitch call the cops
I don't give a fuck, fuck all the ops
Bitch I'm more than alive, I'm immortalized

[Hook: Vic Mensa]

Paper chasing I been running

Everything up, up, up
And I'm down for my niggas yeah
Champagne popping thats vertical
You know how we hang, hang tough
Gang shit

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]

My new girl go both ways (ay), the pussy reversible
Rewind it back when we was running packs

Nigga waking up in the morning like Alonzo
Now a nigga going George Condo
Bitch you don't know, you better ask somebody
Told your girl I'm not anybody
Baby girl say can you be that somebody?
Now you wanna be my main bitch, always be tryna fight somebody
Acting like a cop, she be trying to hop out every time we ride past somebody
Black on black like city crime
Fuck the bullshit gotta gimme mine
Industry niggas and the record labels try to fuck you twice like 69
Pau Gasol, your shit denied
Home team never switching sides
I'm coming over like Ginuwine
I want you in those jeans soon as I arrive
Ass clapping like a high five
Camp counselor and I work the summer

Cup full of paint thinner
