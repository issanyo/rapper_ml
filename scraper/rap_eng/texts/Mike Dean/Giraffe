[Chorus]
Ayy, get your pussy wet

Roll the dice life and rest in peace Hugh Hef, ayy
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, ayy
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, yeah
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, ayy
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, yeah

[Verse 1]
She want a Benz without the top, she wanna skrrt
Fuck I look like, I ain't a trick baby
You can have whatever, long as you come with that bag first
Sorry I'm different, but don't you go mistakin' me for a pimp baby
I can get her the new Birkin, let her ride in that big body suburban
Diamonds so wet, started surfin', I know my old chick probably still be lurkin'
I just be workin', no time for flirtin', and that's for certain
She suck my dick 'til it hurtin', chew that boy nasty, then she start burpin'

[Chorus]
Ayy, get your pussy wet
Put that on my feelings, OG on my breath, ayy
Roll the dice life and rest in peace Hugh Hef, ayy
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, ayy
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, yeah
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, ayy
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, yeah
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, yeah

[Verse 2]
Lil baby stop teasin'
You know I came in for a reason
I see you over there creepin'
Just left my jeweler, he said boy you freezin'
Woke up feelin' blessed but I ain't sneezin'
Walked in with a mink, like it's winter season
She walkin' right behind me then started geekin'
I looked at her and said shawty you tweakin'
Just get on your knees, give me that neck, give me that giraffe
Your shawty went down, she made a mess, girl spit on my Rafs
Baby stay down, don't make a sound, I'ma just smoke on this pound
Chanel that's around, might fuck around and just fly you out of town

[Chorus]
Ayy, get your pussy wet
Put that on my feelings, OG on my breath, ayy
Roll the dice life and rest in peace Hugh Hef, ayy
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, ayy
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, yeah
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, ayy
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, yeah
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, yeah
Ayy, get your pussy wet
Put that on my feelings, OG on my breath, ayy
Roll the dice life and rest in peace Hugh Hef, ayy
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, ayy
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, yeah
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, ayy
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, yeah
Give me giraffe, give me giraffe, I want that neck, yeah
