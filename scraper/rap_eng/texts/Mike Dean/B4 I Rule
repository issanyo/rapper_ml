[Verse 1]
We the ones chosen, so tonight excuse your bitch for choosin'
She can't even help it, try to hide the fact you niggas losin'
Foot on the gas, to the skies, how they like expression
Every minute counts, fuck a second, spend a second guessin
When your life's in jeopardy, do you hop on a spinnin' wheel
Whistle in the whip, they don't turn my shit to Emmit Till
And I hide the fact that in trunk i brought that bitch a bun
Drinkin while I'm drivin eyes closed tryna post up
Crazy how I rotate through pussy just like a rookie
Sometimes I think I need that chemical imbalance just to push me
Livin' life on the edge of my seat, without a plan B
God somewhere a billion feet over me like a stampede
Scar tissue on my elbow, shit felt like velcro
When I took that 30,000 imagine how electrifiying
I guess it's kinda like I took my life in extra time
I take a knee, it's ressurection time

[Bridge]

Sippin 'zine till I fall asleep, I don't need your company
I can hear it in the wind, it's calling me, telling me
Niggas can't fuck with me

Sippin' 'Zine till I fall asleep, I don't need your company
I can hear it in the wind, it's calling me, telling me
Niggas can't fuck with me

[Hook]
I'm sorry it won't be long, before I rule (x2)
I'm sorry it won't be long, before I rule
Before I rule
Before I rule
