[Hook]
No justice, no peace
It's us against police
Every time I turn around they shoot another brother down in these cold, cold streets

[Verse 1]
Shit, I can't even go where I wanna go
Cause I might not even make it to the corner store
Maybe we all gone get shot, I don't even know no mo'
They kill our kids, it seems like they don't get to grow no mo'
And every time I see them cruising in the hood 'bout to murder somebody
That's what they doing in the hood
Then they wonder why I'm strapped when I'm in there
The people protesting has proved the crooked done been there
Then they wonder why we like "fuck the law"
We ain't calling ya'll for shit cause we don't fuck with ya'll
Mr. Officer, crooked officer
It ain't enough for ya'll to keep all of us off of ya'll

[Hook]
No justice, no peace
It's us against police
Every time I turn around they shoot another brother down in these cold, cold streets
No justice, no peace
It's us against police

[Post-Hook]
I'd be damn if I don't ride, I promise I don't want to die
If I do R.I.P
To me

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm tired of holding my hands up
Fuck that, they want me to sit down, but fuck that, I'ma stand up
Black men, Black women the time is now, come on everybody let's man up
Put our differences beside because we understand each other
They don't understand us
Am I next to get shot for selling CD's in front of my favorite neighborhood store
I'm not a rival gang, we getting shot at by cops
It ain't safe in the neighborhood no mo'
You just told me to reach for my wallet
So I reached for my wallet, now I'm dead
We ain't going to the J. Edgar Hoover building
Motherfucka' but we finna go fed
They kill us for sport, just like they hunting
Fuck, it feel like black life ain't nothing
Swear to god I'm so sick of this shit, I'ma protect me and my people
You must be a fool if you think I ain't dumping
Mr Officer, crooked officer, they in Dallas trying to blow the badges off of ya
