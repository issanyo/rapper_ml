She said, she said she wanna have my destination (destination)
Hotel had some reservations (reservations)
My hotel booked a reservated (reservated)
You wanna have my destination?
Oh, my, my destination
Get high, my navigation
Get high, I never waited
High on my elevator, go high on my elevator

Hotel reservated

Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

She don't know how to get to you, oh
She said, "Please send that destination", oh
Too, too strong, oh

[Outro]
She don't know how to get to you, oh
