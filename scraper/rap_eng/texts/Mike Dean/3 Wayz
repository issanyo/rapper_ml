Yeah
Yah, lean, lean on me
Yeah, yeah, codeine
Yeah, yeah, codeine
Yeah, yeah, codeine

[Pre-Hook: Travis Scott]
One more stop 'fore the world stop
We gon' roll this loud, it's prohibited
Making money moves off the laptop
Codeine, codeine, codeine, no prescriptions here

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign & Travis Scott]
It's okay, it's okay, it's alright, yah
We gon' roll, we gon' do what you like, yah
We like to party on a weekday
And everything I do, I do it 3 Wayz
'Case you didn't know
'Case you didn't know
We like to party on a weekday
And everything I do, I do it 3 Wayz

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign & Travis Scott]
'Case you didn't know
Niggas out of Hennessy, bitch, hit the store
Pour that lean, lean, lean, lean, lean
She gon' turn to a freak, have me gone off a bean
Super gone off a bean, he ain't raw off a bean
Got you right on your feet
I need all your energy, all eyes on the Jeep
Bringing that shit to me, nobody but me
'Case you didn't know

[Hook: Travis Scott]
'Case you didn't know
'Case you didn't know
We like to party on a weekday
And everything I do, I do it 3 Wayz

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I could make a wave at the same time, yeah
She on them drugs and the drank at the same time, yeah yeah
Run the numbers up then I copped the Porsche
Hoppin' on your bitch like my six-four
It's okay, it's okay, it's alright, yah
We gon' roll, we gon' do what you like, yeah
We like to party on a weekday
And everything I do, I do it 3 Wayz

[Hook: Travis Scott]
'Case you didn't know
'Case you didn't know
We like to party on a weekday
And everything I do, I do it 3 Wayz

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Bottles on me, bottles on me
Diamonds on me, all these hoes on me
Real niggas only, riders only
Riding in my jeep, got your bitch with me
My momma say what's gotten into me
Way too many shots of the Hennessy
Way too many thoughts, I met you in my dreams
Ooh, yeah

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Bottles on me
Bottles on me
Bottles on me
Bottles on me
