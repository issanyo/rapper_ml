[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
My girl made him wait 'til the hours of the night
Then hit you with the, "You know it's mid, right?"
Can't be on time for the free rides
Can't be my type, I'm a low life
Crammed in some time, now I'm your whole life
Can't make those calls in the low light
Are you ready to go? We gon' be waitin' in line
Yeah you look good, would I fuck? Yeah
Did I? Almost
Back home with that, almost
Back home with that, next time
Bags with all that Rally's in 'em
Trades with all the valley (Come on!)
Top chopped down like blades came through the valley
Freeway

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Despite our history
Somewhere in your nights, you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me
Spirits watch me, pants down
Can't be 'barrassed of it
I feel their smiles on me (Smiles on me)
I feel their smiles on me (Smile on me)
I feel their smiles on me (Lens on me right now)
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Throw team on back like I tatted the Mariah (Know I got some sins on me)
Then get the scream mask for the vert ride (Ridin')
Weed smoke in the sky, picture what I'm realizin' (Got some sins on me)
Ain't seen rainbows in the sky since college
This thing won't last unless we're both lyin' (Both lyin')
Fake flowers, no water needed
Real life drowned by the weekend
No wins, call it timeless
No ends 'cause you're timeless (Timeless!)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Despite our history
Somewhere in your nights, you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me (All this life)
Spirits watch me, pants down
Can't be 'barrassed of it
I feel their smiles on me (On me, on me, on me)
I feel their smiles on me
I feel their smiles on me

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Lionel got a lens, Janet got a lens
Matthew got a lens on me right now, yeah
Cleve got a lens, Kevin got a lens
Know I got some sins on me right now
On me
On me, on me
On me, on me
On me, on me
On me, on me
On me, on me

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Ayy roll up this
Yeah, cameras, cameras on me, I need tints (Watch, tints)
Smilin' but inside I'm feelin' bent (Watch, tints)
Come direct, please I can't take no hints (Yah! Yeah)
Bicycles and pegs, yeah
Ride low, duck the feds, watch
Du-rag on my head, yeah
Money on my head, yeah
Cameras, cameras on me when I'm bent
Mix the waterfall right behind the tent (Yeah)
Backseat, spacious, I pulled up, spaceship, yeah (Turn it)
This ain't Vegas, yeah this here vacant, yeah (Turn it)
Black skin bastard, tad bit savage
Cause a tad bit havoc, when I come through, damage
Hop out (Hop out), roll (Roll), pop it, pour (Pour)
Planet froze, chain Keyshia Cole (Froze)
Molly help me sleep, yeah
Xannies make her sleep, yeah
93, 93, 93, spot
Yeah
