[Chorus]
I is working strong to perfect my skills
I can become somewhat of a better man
I will get my shit straighter everyday that I live (Cause)
I be concerned about unity for you and me

[Verse 1]
My talk is slightly different and my walk is not the same
I can't pronounce a couple words that's in the dictionary man
I know it's easier to call me names than to understand my nature
You and me might disagree but that don't mean I have to hate you
Take some time to talk to someone who has a totally different culture
You just might learn something new it ain't gonna hurt ya
To collaborate, combinate and ya'll can make the change
Instead of fighting each other cause your life is so plain
(Now he got his thang and you got yours
She got hers since the day she was born)
So we all got to get a long cause ain't nobody better than the next
No matter what race, color, creed, or sex
But you can better your self by listening to others
And what they got to offer treat them like sisters and brothers
Love them even though you disapprove sometimes
We all have faults I know I got mines
So

[Chorus]
I is working strong to perfect my skills
I can become somewhat of a better man
I will get my shit straighter everyday that I live (Cause)
I be concerned about unity for you and me

[Verse 2]
Ahh
Look at that tall ass man
Look at the little lady damn she must be from Japan
Well what's wrong with shaking her hand
A stranger just might be a friend u never met yet
Everybody ain't always out to get shit
If you don't like where they going then you don't have to follow them
Learn to trust your self and other people won't be a problem
We all have a purpose, no need to feel nervous
About your skeptics and do things cause you want to be accepted
(Now he got his thing and you got your
She got hers since the day she was born)
And its like that make the most out of the life you live
Every day's a blessing respect people and just try to give
Your best, it's a pest, Benefits you will get
If you would, just lay there negative to rest
I know a pest in a bothers some folks might be
And it might be you if you smoke like me
But see

[Chorus]
I is working strong to perfect my skills
I can become somewhat of a better man
I will get my shit straighter everyday that I live (Cause)
I be concerned about unity for you and me
I is working strong to perfect my skills
I can become somewhat of a better man
I will get my shit straighter everyday that I live (Cause)
I be concerned about unity for you and me
