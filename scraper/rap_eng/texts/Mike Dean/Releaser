[Intro: Kid Cudi Harmonizing]

[Verse: Kid Cudi]
You knew you'd find me
Hmm, hmm
You knew just where to find me
Hmm, hmm
Je t'aime beaucoup, tu es drôle, t'es à moi
Hmm, hmm
No longer you can deny me
Hmm, hmm

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
It's blinding, your glory
Your glory is blinding (Hmm, hm-hmm)
Blinding, your glory is blinding
Your glory is blinding (Hmm, hmm)

[Bridge: Kacy Hill]
I think I'm on the verge of breaking down
And I'm on the verge of breaking down, you know-oh-oh
Think I'm on the verge of breaking down, you know-oh-oh
