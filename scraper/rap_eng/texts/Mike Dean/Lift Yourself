[Chorus: Amnesty]
Hard to see, ooh
The hang ups we have today
Said we need to strive for more liberty
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Hard to see, ooh
The hang ups we have today
Said we need to strive for more liberty
Lift yourself up on your feet
Lift yourself up on your feet
Lift yourself up on your feet
Lift yourself up on your feet
Lift

[Break: Dezz]

[Chorus: Amnesty]
Lift your- lift your-, lift yourself
Lift-lift your-, lift your-, lift your-, lift your-, lift-lift

[Interlude: Kanye West & Amnesty]
Hard to see, ooh
The hang ups we have today-ay-ay
But they don't really realize, though
Said we need to strive for more liberty
This next verse, this next verse though
Lift yourself up on your feet
These bars
Lift yourself up on your feet
Watch this, go
