[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Don't sleep on me (Don't sleep)
Stop sleepin' on (Don't sleep)
Stop sleepin' on (Please don't sleep)
Stop sleepin' on me
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Don't sleep on me
Stop sleeping on (Stop sleepin' on me)
Stop sleeping on
Stop sleep on me (Ooh-yeah)

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Don't sleep on me (Don't sleep)
Don't creep on me (Don't creep)
Don't creep on me (Don't creep)
Don't let me find out
Don't sleep on me (Don't sleep)
Please don't creep on me (Don't creep)
Don't creep on me (Don't creep)
No, don't let me find out

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Don't let me find out
Don't let me find out
Don't let me find out
Don't let me find out (Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't sleep on me
Please don't creep on me
Don't sleep on me
No, don't let me find out
Don't let me find out

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Don't let me find out
Don't sleep on me
Don't creep on me (Don't creep)
Got my piece on me (Got my piece)
Cause you know I'm crazy (You know I'm crazy)
Crazy over you
Out my mind, ain't no tellin' what I'll do
Girl, we both made that promise, I ain't switchin' up
Stay solid even when I got my money up
I remember when you fucked me in the Beamer truck
I was running out of gas, only had two bucks
Always came up on the wheels, never on the bus
Always did our own shit, fuck what everybody does
We was geekin' off a molly at the festival
Now I'm in a booty club, throwing all the ones

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Don't sleep on me (Don't sleep)
Don't creep on me (Don't creep)
Don't creep on me (Don't cheat)
Don't let me find out (No, no, no, no no, no)
Don't sleep on me
Please don't creep on me (Please don't creep)
Don't creep on me (Don't creep)
No, don't let me find out

[Post-Chorus: Future]
You can't sip my lean if you gon' go to sleep
Don't you sip my lean, don't you sleep on me
Don't you sleep on me, Hermés all on me
Don't you sleep on me, I pass you up in the big old V

[Verse 2: Future]
I just went out with some ooh, ooh
She hit me up with some ooh juice
Champagne at the photoshoot
Celebrating, no curfew
Straight shots, never curve you
G63 when you swerve through
Droppin' points on you, ma
Grateful tatted on my arm
Jealous bitches be despised
What the fuck they from?
Who hide them?
Fuck the nigga, check the iTunes
Turned they goons all to my goons
No sleep gang
I'll drop you off where I found you
Only pain we recognize is pills (pills)
Xans, xans got you dozin' off
Manolos, Hublots, got you showing off
Xans, xans, got you dozin' off
Tennis bracelet, diamond chain, got you goin' off

[Bridge: Future]
We make love the first time we seen
We make love and not wise with the sneak
We make love the first time we seen
We make love and not wise with the sneak

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Don't sleep on me (Don't sleep)
Don't creep on me (Don't creep)
Don't creep on me (Don't cheat)
Don't let me find out (No, no, no, no, no, no)
Don't sleep on me
Please don't creep on me (Please don't creep)
Don't creep on me (Please don't creep)
No, don't let me find out

[Post-Chorus: Future]
You can't sip my lean if you gon' go to sleep
Don't you sip my lean, don't you sleep on me
Don't you sleep on me, Hermés all on me
Don't you sleep on me, I pass you up in the big old V

[Verse 3: 24hrs]
She play Twenty in the hills when she lonely
She said, "Twenty, do you want to fuck my homie?"
All my bitches bad, and they ain't got no stomach
Gucci jacket cost me fifty-four hundred
Aye, Twenty, tell Dolla, I fuck with him
You work and I see you up next to him
Don't sleep on me
That's my only fear
She said, "Twenty, boy, this your year"

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Don't sleep on me (Don't sleep)
Don't creep on me (Don't creep)
Don't creep on me (Don't cheat)
Don't let me find out (No, no, no, no, no, no)
Don't sleep on me
Please don't creep on me (Please don't creep)
Don't creep on me (Please don't creep)
No, don't let me find out

[Post-Chorus: Future]
Can't sip my lean if you gon' go to sleep
Don't you sip my lean, don't you sleep on me
Don't you sleep on me, Hermés all on me
Don't you sleep on me, I pass you up in the big old V

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, you know I'm crazy
Crazy for you
Out my mind
Ain't no telling what I'll do
You know I'm crazy
Crazy over you
Out my mind
Ain't no telling what I'll do
