[Verse 1: YXVNGLXRD]

Uh, looked through her eyes and I saw the Devil in her head
I tried to warn her but instead she just gave me head
Realized I was the only one sinning
Thought about beginning again but I never meant it
No criticism for the lyricism, lyrics bring the scriptures in it
Now I'm exercising exorcism
The Devil still in my eyes how could i dare resist her?
Well i do, i just gotta say it 'fore she kisses mister
And he fucks his mistress, but Satan won this round
And you never realize it, but i really hope someday you'll prolly find it
Cause i never will, i got verses still, that i prolly never will
Spit before the album drop, i hope the Devil is in eyes the same day my album drop
And if she is then she prolly gon pop, pop her top for the rocks
Pop that pussy like pop rocks
And i prolly won't stop 'til the chorus hits like Katrina had a baby with Ike
And i fly like I'm Mike, I'm too fly like a kite, no really I'm fly like a kite
I'm so confused like i just peeped a dyke
Or my followers on Instagram don't bare me a like
Its like my life went downhill since i started chasing Satan
But its just a waste of time so forget it, I'm done chasing
Satan won again, but then again, I'm sinning again
All my verses permanent written in pen, for the same person
Personal purposeful letters written in cursive cursing your name like i meant to hurt you

[Hook]

Feel like the Devil is in your eyes I can see her tonight
I'm prolly sinning again
But what I'm feeling is right

[Verse 2: YXVNGLXRD]

Put your hands to the constellations, the way you look should be a sin you my sensation
I'm done chasing these bitches on the block, cause I was chasing a thot
And she almost got me shot, by the dope man that drives around my neighborhood
Looking for souls to reap and some feel good
Looking for brain just trying nail some wood
Cause if the Devil tempt me nigga fuck yea I would.....
Only if I got a Chance like the rapper, eating racial slurs like crackers
While my Lambeau Field like the Packers, all green for the smackers
Prolly getting smacked right now just too heem for the Devil
And if you thought i was lying, then maybe you should go and tell him...
OR HER
