[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
When I was broke, girl, we wasn't rocking
But to tell the truth, girl, that didn't stop me
Said you wanna get the wraith, I'mma cop that
Pull up and now you drop that
Now, we picking up every time you drop that
And your next dude, you know I'mma top that
And she wanna come back, she wanna come back to me
Now, she wanna come back, now, she wanna come back to me

[Chorus]
But she don't fly my way
Unless I'm on PJ's
That gossip, all you say
My baby, you got so LA
Can't believe you're so simple like that
Can't believe you're so simple
Can't believe you're so simple like that
Can't believe you're so simple

[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]
When I got on, girl, you didn't trust me
But to tell you the truth, girl, that didn't bug me
You came to my party with your young socialite
I slid a couple bitches I was cold as ice
Then the next morning you gon' tell me you love me
Now, she wanna come back, she wanna come back to me
Now, she wanna come back, now, she wanna come back to me

[Chorus]
But she don't fly my way
Unless I'm on PJ's
That gossip, all you say
My baby, you got so LA
Can't believe you're so simple like that
Can't believe you're so simple
Can't believe you're so simple like that
Can't believe you're so simple

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
She's so simple, she's so clich√©
She's so gossip, she say, he say
She wants me back, says that each day
But I don't repeat and I don't replay
She moved to Weho, now, that's where she stay
1 Oak on weekday, she fucks a DJ
She won't fly my way 'less I'm on PJ
She lied to me, I would die before I betray
Anyone I love most, anyone I hold close
Sniffing all her love up, OD off of one dose
One shot, play me, I become ghost
You could be the prettiest, but ugly when it's up close
Used to be my type, but now, I'm off those
Driving through the city full of lost souls
Just be careful, look out for the potholes
But now, I know how to spot those

[Outro: Marc E. Bassy & G-Eazy]
But she don't drive my car, unless I'm on a boulevard
That vintage fits you good
You getting old in Hollywood (hey)
Can't believe you're so simple like that
Can't believe you're so simple (I can't believe it)
Can't believe you're so simple like that
Can't believe you're so simple (yeah)
