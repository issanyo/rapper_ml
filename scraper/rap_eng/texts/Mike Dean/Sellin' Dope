Wrappin' up the package, drug traffic, I say
Wrappin' up the package, drug traffic, nigga
Wrappin' up the package, drug traffic, nigga
Wrappin' up the package, drug traffic, nigga

[Bridge]
Wrappin' up the package, drug traffic
She say she need that oowee so I told that bitch I got it, nigga
Wrappin' up the package, drug traffic
She say she need that oowee so I told that bitch I got it, nigga

I'm on the corner, my mama know I'm sellin' dope
I serve my neighbor, my mama know I'm sellin' dope
I'm gettin' this paper, my mama know I'm sellin' dope
Just cook this cake up, my mama know I'm sellin' dope
I'm on the corner, my mama know I'm sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Wrappin' up the package, drug traffic
She say she need that oowee so I told that bitch I got it
Got my first sack off that ho
Then I served 10 more, now I supply it
Iced my neck out, Lac, when I step out
Mom wanna know just how I'm ridin'
Cause I, I sell dope, I smoke dope
Just vogued up my Caddy, mustard and mayonnaise on gold spokes
Pass that thrax to the back and I laugh as I watch these hoes choke
On that OG Kush but she like to play with her nose though
M30s, sippin' dirty, zan bars in my white cup
Shippin' pounds, super loud, dope sacks, they're mic'd up, bitch
I'm gettin' this paper, I'm on the corner
I serve my neighbor, he smoke them boulders

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Wrappin' up the package to fuck with them ratchets
Hit me on my batphone, think I heard some static
Puttin' work at McDonald's, I'm 'bout dirty cabbage
Not a billion served but bitch I serve them addicts
Birdies go for 43, I'm gon' move accordingly
Y'all niggas better get some knee pads
Niggas see the ski mask and you know it's me
Just cooked up a quarter ki
Copped some dope, ignore the fee
And I cock and reload that
Better show up at my doorstep 40 deep
Takedown, shakedown
40K on my break down
I'ma send my cousin all 8 pounds
And get a brick and watch it get shaved down, bitch
Cause I'm stackin' bundles, I'm on the corner
Just served my uncle, he smoke them boulders

[Pre-Hook]
Wrappin' up the package, drug traffic, I say
Wrappin' up the package, drug traffic, nigga
Wrappin' up the package, drug traffic, nigga
Wrappin' up the package, drug traffic, nigga
