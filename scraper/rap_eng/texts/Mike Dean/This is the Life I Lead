When they see Dat Nigga Daz they say I'm dangerous...

[Daz Dillinger]
Yeah!...
This Is The Life I Lead...

Through my eyes as a youngster, never ran the hood as a busta
Tryin' to make somethin' out of nothin'
Disrespectin' and cussin', bein' wild
The only child, in '95 my brother died
It only made me stronger to survive
As I walk through it now, bein' ready for whatever
Fire with these eyes, shootin' just to get high, whatever
Truely weeded and high, blastin' niggas for highs
Beatin' suckas with straps, chrome bars, and ties
I make 'em all remember so you niggas never ever forget
Who be runnin' this shit
You'll get batted from an angle
You'll get torched out then strangled
We shootin' for every angle so prepare for the day
That's how you wanted it, on some rugged shit
24/7 stay thugged up and blunted bitch
Sincerely yours, it's the D-A-Z
For all you fake niggas - rest in peace

[Chorus]
This Is The Life I Lead
Bitches, money, cars, and a gang of weed
This Is The Life I Lead
Guns, respect, and havin' some major G's
This Is The Life I Lead
Bitches, money, cars, and a gang of weed
This Is The Life I Lead
Guns, respect, and havin' some major G's
This Is The Life I Lead...

(Money, dope, cars, and bitches)
This Is The Life I Lead
(When they see Dat Nigga Daz they say I'm dangerous)

[Daz Dillinger]
My old ways made me misbehave
Nowadays wicked ways, out there just gettin' paid
My ex lady think I'm strung out
Because I drink and smoke my lungs out, they dish my love out
Thugged out, tweakin' and seekin' for a dream
That almost came true, what's the future for me?
I gave my life to you niggas, how would you repay with anger?
Hangin' y'all niggas like a hanger (fuck y'all)
True bangers, real soldiers
The more I live the more I get older
Hustlin' and bustin' y'all niggas from the shoulders
To let you know you ain't runnin' this show
I gave my soul for a pot of gold
I was young, now I'm livin' life too old
I'll watch the gauge explode
I told you niggas, don't never speak my name no more (nigga!)
Now I'm clutchin' on the fo'-fo', I keep my weapon and steppin'
Somebody in the house tonight is goin' to Hell or Heaven
I try my best, never to always be slippin'
Everyday a single day y'all niggas come up missin'
I double up to make a come up
I'm sorry if they come runnin' if they all get done up
And any motherfucker can bleed
Dat Nigga Daz, that's some D.P.G

[Chorus]
This Is The Life I Lead
Bitches, money, cars, and a gang of weed
This Is The Life I Lead
Guns, respect, and havin' some major G's
This Is The Life I Lead
Bitches, money, cars, and a gang of weed
This Is The Life I Lead
Guns, respect, and havin' some major G's
This Is The Life I Lead...

(Money, dope, cars, and bitches)
This Is The Life I Lead
(When they see Dat Nigga Daz they say I'm dangerous)

[Daz Dillinger]
Livin' life by the gun or the knife
High as a kite, cold wilin' through the night
Stackin' hundreds, kept in case you hoes comin'
Young gunnin', tortured and then you'll be punished
My weed habit is just a big cabbage
Lifestyle was lavish, livin' my life unbalanced
It was a challenge, livin' my life like a savage
To have it or not to have it, or nobody could have it
Untouchable, indestructible
Nigga get in my way and I'll dust a few
As a kid this the type of shit that I dreamed of -
Money, cars, bitches, and drugs
I prevailed the murder trail that's got me jailed
At the end of a story will my truth be prevailed? (hell nah)
Another day it explodes, the story is told
You won't see my on the street 'til I'm 60 years old

[Chorus]
This Is The Life I Lead
Bitches, money, cars, and a gang of weed
This Is The Life I Lead
Guns, respect, and havin' some major G's
This Is The Life I Lead
Bitches, money, cars, and a gang of weed
This Is The Life I Lead
Guns, respect, and havin' some major G's
This Is The Life I Lead...

(Money, dope, cars, and bitches)
This Is The Life I Lead
(When they see Dat Nigga Daz they say I'm dangerous)


[Outro]
Yeah... y'all know what I'm about
(Money, dope, cars, and bitches)
Everywhere y'all niggas go y'all can be touched
(When they see Dat Nigga Daz they say I'm dangerous)
Yeah! HA HA
(Money, dope, cars, and bitches)
This Is The Life I Lead
(When they see Dat Nigga Daz they say I'm dangerous)
