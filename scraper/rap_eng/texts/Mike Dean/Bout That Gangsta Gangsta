[2-4]
We gagnstas, Niggas
Uh, uh

A really Nigga roll
I'ma get to bust 'em
S-N-Y-P-A-Z clearin' blocks for no discussion
And rushin' up adrenaline
Plus I'm flusin' brew and drop a cent in 'em
Chi-town really know
With my boys Buck and Craig in 'em
Hoes, I never beg in 'em
I be spittin' that double G (What's that)
You put the third leg in 'em
Uh, word, to my son
One, Deuce
He gettin' paid, cause we laid
Down that solid-ass juice, truce
Now who's the next to slip the news around they dick
Fuckin' with my click that's what you get
Better yet this pig
Fuckin' blood
That's the only way we showin' love
I love to see you bleedin'
On a picture you be readin'
R-I-P
Peace to all them Snypaz on M-O-N-R-O-E
And the Ghetto T-W, double I, N-Z

Chorus x1

Verse 4:
[G-Mone]
You don't wanna visualize
That Nigga G, evil eyes
These tentensees, please
Pussin' you can die fuckin' with me
Luckily, hung with the G-E-T till the TO Twiinz
And my gun's down, flick, click
Move shit, cause I'm feelin' bustas again
Ready with 2 clips, so who is this
Fuckin' with me
Fuckin' with you
Nigga, who knew I blew his fuckin' brains out
If pointed out him died to
Why not had you be mindin' your business
But no, snitch, witness this splittin' window
And this what I'm thinkin' as I dig slow
Snitch, Bitch, trippin'
Let's listen while I laugh some mo'
6 feet deep

Defeated to see
Cause y'all already buried
Bitch, we be bout gangsta shit
We gangstas Nigga
