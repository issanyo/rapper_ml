They did not tell us that all of that, "being my own person and my being independent", would lead to separation, loneliness, celibacy, and lesbianism
They didn't tell us that if you give up the man, you're gonna take one of these things, it gets worse and would destroy your nation
They made us think it was some kind of glorified position to brag about the fact that I got my own job, my own credit card, my own car, so I don't need no man
I don't even know how we got that mixed up, ain't none of that  got anything to do with having being with no man
We have some serious relationship problems, you know, over 60% of our women are single, widowed, separated, or divorced. They don't have a man. They need fathers, they need protection. To raise a child, you need a parental coalition of a man and a woman. We have sons, by not having have a father in the home, they don't know how to respect women. They may bring the welfare system in and tell us in order to feed, and clothe, and house our children, we have to give up our manâ€“we have to put the man out of the house.

But in the black community they make it a requirement, because they want to keep endorsing into the black community that the black man is no good
