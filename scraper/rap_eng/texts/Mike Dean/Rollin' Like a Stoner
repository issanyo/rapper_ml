[Verse 1]
Rollin' like a stoner, I don't care about everything
Out of control, I forgot to take my medicine
If I take this pill, will that be the death of me?
I am a disaster, I don't need a recipe
Tried to be sober, that didn't work for me
I don't know your name, please excuse my memory
Anti-social, get the fuck away from me
I got a problem
Rockstar life
I got the salts, I got the spice (vroom, vroom)
Fuck every night
And if she bad, I hit it twice, yeah

[Chorus]
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
I got a problem nobody knows
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
I got a problem nobody knows

[Verse 2]
One, two, three too many drinks, I think I might forget
How to count to ten, I tend to turn two shots into a fifth
I drive better when I'm drunk, I rock leather like a punk
Hennessy make me Dead Kennedys, I get too drunk to fuck
They say "Vic, are you okay?", Dude no way, I don't even know no more
I don't even pour no more but I be leanin' like a cholo
Tony Hawk, I'm going overboard, need to take it slow mo'
Your girl treat me like a Polaroid, shake it for a photo
Swi-swi-swimming in alcohol my Marco Polo
Baby girl, I am a loner, flyin' high and solo
Rollin' like a stoner, out of control
Cause I got a problem nobody knows

[Chorus]
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
I got a problem nobody knows
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
I got a problem nobody knows

[Outro]
Dreaming of the good days that I had
Now I'm hearing the voices in my head
Tellin' me to jump off of the edge
I got a problem nobody knows
I got a problem nobody knows
I got a problem nobody knows
