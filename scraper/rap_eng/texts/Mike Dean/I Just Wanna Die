Desperate Shouting:

What can we do with all this fucking pain?
Somebody stop the pain!

Verse 1:

I finally look to paint a picture of my whole life
And for me to end it would be so nice
Somebody driving on this back street
So I could leave my shit all on the back seat
Cause I don't love my life no more
So I don't wanna fight no more
I felt this way before but it died out
So I shot my fucking eye out
Nobody understands me HELP
But I don't understand my SELF
I always find myself bein trapped
And my drugs that I take so I'm at
That point in my motherfuckin life
Where I don't wanna live a fuckin lie
I just wanna die

Chorus:

I just wanna die
Die
I just wanna die
Die

Let's go on a journey
Boldly go where no man has gone before

Verse 2:

Buckle up and lets take a ride
I want you to watch me commit suicide
We're headed for a place in a dark land
In desperate search of that dark man
But don't you move keep it right there
I wanna bring you smooth into my nightmare
Don't be afraid of watching life bleed
Explore my every thought, come out and sightsee
There's no man alive, that can promise breath
But once we arrive, I can promise death
And now were headed for the crossroads
Gettin deeper in the lost coves
And once we arrive
Close your motherfuckin eyes
Cause I'm about to die

Skit:
Will wake up
"What, what, what, what man"
Damn you ain't been listenin man?
This shit is real, man, I don't give a fuck will, you payin attention
"just drive nigga, damn"
You listenin, will its goin down, right fuckin now

Verse 3:

I put the pistol to my temple
See the bullet in the chamber
Cocked it back and out of anger
I pulled the crack, see the shells jump out the side
Now I'm fallin back, I'm seein faces but they're all in black
I'm hearin sounds but I can't hear
I'm seein pictures in my head but they ain't clear
My every picture flashed at full speed
And now I'm feelin like I'm loosin my grips on all reality
But my reality's a battle G
And I was tired of havin talks with myself about mentality
End it all I stand tall apparently I wasn't patient enough to hear the man
Call
So now I leave myself to strive or die, but I've lost all my hopes inside
And I just wanna die

Yo will wake the fuck up
"What, what, what, Man, Damn"
Man I'm talkin about killin myself man
"Wanna kill yourself?"
That's right I don't give a fuck
"Aight"
What you think I'm playin
Argument......gunshot.......car crash
