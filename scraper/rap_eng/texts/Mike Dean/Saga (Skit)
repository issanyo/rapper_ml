[Verse 1: RZA]
Spread the propaganda
They tryna stop us from prospering
They don't wanna see us grow
They wanna squash us in
I travel to mountain ranges
Acknowledge the change of the climate
I think man's the most destructive climate
But it's another Wu saga
Continuing like Buck Rodgers
In the twenty-first century
And we still gotta duck the coppers
On a seaport in Newport beach
I see military air carriers on the shores
They had a whole fleet
Of weapons of mass destruction with mass production
Of war machines that function to secure this world corruption
We cross more streets than Frogger
More tweets than a blogger
They perform acts of violence
Like they tryna win a Oscar
From El Salvador to Nicaragua
And Detroit to Divine City
They poison up the agua
Anywhere we try to go they try to stop us
They spread the propaganda so we cannot prosper
I guess we better sell some more Aquafina
Should we just leave our homes like the prophet Muhammad left Mecca for Medina
Wow, that's crazy
