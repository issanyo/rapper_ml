[Verse 1]
Everyday it's been the same old thang on my block
You either working or you slanging cocaine on my block
You had to hustle, cause that's how we was raised on my block
And you stayed on your hop until you made you a knot
On my block, to hang out was the thing back then
And even when you left out, you came back in
To my block, from Holloway, Bellfort, to Scott
Reed Road to Phlox, we know the spots
Smoke weed and rocks, drink all the blue dots
On yo' block you prolly bred a Fat Pat or 2Pac
Or Big Pun, or B.I., ya homeboys from knee-high
And even when it was storming outside, that nigga'd be by
That's me, dogg, on my block, I ain't have to play the big shot
Niggas knew me back when I was stealing beers from Shamrock
And my nickname was Creepy, if Black June could see me
He'd be tripping - and I'd bet he still try to tease me

[Hook]
My block - where everything is everything for sheezy
My block - we probably done it all homey believe me
My block - we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block - I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me

[Verse 2]
On my block, we duck the nigga-haters and the cops
Fuck a IROC, we race Impalas, chromed-out
On my block - it ain't no different than the next block
Ya get drunk and pass out, and they back ya to the house
And when you wake up on the couch you going right back at it
On my block when ya that fucked up they laugh at it
On my block, it's just another day in the heart
Of the Southside of Houston Texas, making your mark
On my block, we're cuing all the time, playing dominoes
Keep the Swishers sweet down until my Mama goes
Back inside -- then we can fire
Pass it around a few times to get high

[Hook]
My block - where everything is everything for sheezy
My block - we probably done it all homey believe me
My block - we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block - I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me

[Verse 3]
On my block, everybody business ain't ya business
What's going on in this house is staying here, comprende?
On my block, ya had to have that understanding
Cause if ya told Ms. Mattie, she went and told Gladys
And once ya mama got it, it was all on the wire
And when the word got back, they set yo' ass on fire
On my block, we got some 'Nam vets shell-shocked
Who never quite got right, now they inhale rocks
On my block--it's like the world don't exist
We stay confined to this small little section we living in
Oh my block, I wouldn't trade it for the world
Cause I love these ghetto boys and girls
Born and raised on my block

[Hook]
My block - where everything is everything for sheezy
My block - we probably done it all homey believe me
My block - we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block - I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me
