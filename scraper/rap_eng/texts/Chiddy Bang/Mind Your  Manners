[Intro: Icona Pop & Chiddy]
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba
There is no one like me
Th-th-there is no one like me, like me
(Chiddy Bang)
Ma-ma-manners take a second look and you'll see
(And we pretty much amazing)
There is no one like me (yeah)
There is no one like me
(Mind your manners)

[Verse 1: Chiddy]
And all the people should be raisin' they glasses
Flow crazy, celebratin' the madness
I never thought I would deliver no classics
Then I hooked up with them and then delivered mo' classics
I be keeping it true, hotel good as long as I could peep on the view
Like, like damn how high are we?
You gotta gamble in this life Charles Barkley
I'm over protected, through the dopest of methods
Now my vocal perfected, this is audio breakfast
Yes, so tell a hater here's the slammer
I know they hatin' on us but mind your manners

[Hook: Icona Pop]
Manners, take a second look and you'll see
There is no one like me
Th-th-there is no one like me, like me
(Like me la-la-la-la like me)
Ma-ma-manners, you better reconsider
'Cause you will never do better
There is no one like me, like me
(Like me la-la-la-la like me)
(See this is etiquette right here, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-da-ba, ba-ba-da (Mind your manners)
There is no one like me (Mind your manners)
There is no one like

[Verse 2: Chiddy]
So say la, la-la
I arrived, voila
Black-eyed I am, I surprise will.I
And I can't rely on another guy
I was caterpillared into a butterfly!
I’m livin' in the moment, why won't you go and own it?
And we don’t got the spirits, at least we could Coron it
Order sake homie
I be sippin' Ty Ku, and you get the wrong number if I don't like you
Say I'm the man, tell me why I gotta lie too?
Anybody, I'm the best, girl let me advise you
Why?
Because I'm feeling invincible
Junior high school I had a crush on the principal
I guess I was turned on by the leadership
Now we got the game wrapped up on some pita shit
So tell a hater here's a slammer
I know they hatin' on us but mind your manners!

[Hook: Icona Pop]
Manners, take a second look and you'll see
There is no one like me
Th-th-there is no one like me, like me
(Like me la-la-la-la like me)
Ma-ma-manners, you better reconsider
'Cause you will never do better
There is no one like me, like me
(Like me la-la-la-la like me)
(manners)
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba

[Bridge: Chiddy]
We gon' be here forever man (Mind your manners)
(There is no one like me)
Chiddy, (There is no one like me)(Mind your manners) ugh Xaphoon, Sam (Mind your manners)
Pretty much 'till they kick me out the booth
And we pretty much amazing

[Hook: Icona Pop]
Manners, take a second look and you'll see
There is no one like me (Mind your manners)
Th-th-there is no one like me, like me
(yeah this is etiquette bitches)
Ma-ma-manners, you better reconsider
'Cause you will never do better
There is no one like me, like me

[Outro: Chiddy]
So you could keep searchin' and searchin' (Mind your manners)
(Manners, take a second look and you'll see)
Try and find someone better (There is no one like me)
How long will that take? (Mind your manners)
I'll wait
