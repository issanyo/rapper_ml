[Verse 1: Chiddy]
They say hello, they say aloha, they say bonjour
I’m 'bout to kill this shit, I think I need an encore
These other rappers need to focus on they songs more
If you ain’t faded then you need to hit the bong more
I said I’m fly, get the words in, someone bring the herbs in
Chicks is like a plane, only like them if they virgins
But, I exquisitely quote
Been through slippery slopes, now I figure we toast
Toast, there’s no traffic up here, yeah we run the sky
Homie, I done seen everything, London Eye
Uh, uh, and ain’t nobody fresher
Semester to semester, my Carmen is Electra
It's high to my acceptors, say bye to my professors
20 light bulbs on the table of my dresser
G-Star, I got a crazy dumb collection
Opposing parties, you will never ruin the election

[Hook: Chiddy]
Yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
This is a toast of celebration, bring a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out
Yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
This is a toast of celebration, bring a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out

[Interlude]
(Pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out)

[Verse 2: Chiddy]
I’m 'bout to pass out
I’m ,bout to shatter in the game, bring a glass out
Okay, I’m goin’ crazy and insane, I’m on a fast route
So I’m gettin’ money, baby, I’m about to cash out
I said it’s Chiddy Bang mania, schooled in Pennsylvania
She sucked me in the neck, vampire Transylvania
Rappin’ to make words rhyme, that’s not trainin’ ya
Success, we’re attainin’ ya, bullets we are aimin’ ya
Pop, we throw it in our bare hands
I’m a rare man, my logo’s the Air man
Grade A flow, but I gotta put the effort in
Me and Xaphoon movin’ up, we the Jeffersons
Please bring my letters in, A-list, put this on your playlist
Probably heard us through the grapevines, some Marvin Gaye shit
Watch me as I spit in daytime and make your face flip
Travel out to Scotland and back, now that’s a day trip

[Hook + Interlude]
