Officially on top the moon
Things are looking up, things are lookin'
Out 2 space
Things are looking up, things are lookin'
Soon I'm gonna be a star
Things are looking up, things are lookin'
I just would touch the stars
Or am I out 2 Space

Gettin' money not the filthy way
Talk down still they stay
Right where they at, but me I'm aiming for the milky way
So things are looking up
I see them skyscrapers
Forget me I need a crib with some fly neighbors
Hi haters, anything I flow on, feels so comfy like a pair of cold hands
Teacher I am Present
The homie I be so gone
How I get here? I just paved the road that I drove on. So long!
(Yeah)
And this the feeling that they can't control
We taking off to the stars now
I'm getting stoned while my brother rolls
So me and Keith (Richards) will prolly blow it down
Cross it off the list, I am never off my shift
I squeeze all my clothes, yeah they cost a grip
Visibly on the moon visit me
Engage in astrocirricular activity

Officially on top the moon
Things are looking up, things are lookin
Out 2 space
Things are looking up, things are lookin

It's a hard act to follow man
Call me Apollo man
Things are looking up and this is what I wallow in
Fresh dress press ironed like Solomon
Could you tell me how many chances I could I give a man?
Livin' grand home is where I rest do I feel out of place?
'Cause we resorted to be in orbit in outer space
Wanted the fame back when HOV made Lucifer
Just passed jupiter tell the students I made my own rules
Give a fuck about them handbooks
They owe it to me like money that Uncle Sam took
They try to treat me like a graduated Grand Brook
That's a private school, chillin, yup, I've been cool
Team Swell the tightest crew
We eatin' so just allow us the right to chew
People love me say "Chiddy nobody tight as you! "
So I show improve
I say this one for the books it's long overdue
