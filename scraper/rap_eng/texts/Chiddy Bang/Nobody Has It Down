[Verse 1]
Hey yo I step into the room like the freshest of the year
And me not being successful has ever been a fear
These people say they red carpet but never do appear
And I just be there with the shit that I wear
Oh yeah, it’s something bad bitches do to me
Shit I’m about to take this ship and this is mutiny
I’m the mayor of the Swelly Community
And that wack shit has never been cool to me
It’s dangerous, big shout to Mystikal
They say they getting fly, I think its fictional
We puff medicinal in thirty minute intervals
And that’s a minimal, does that make me a criminal?
Yeah Chiddy sick and I’m about to give you the scoop
Hop in that whip and one button shit through the roof
I keep females dancing in the hula hoops
And I don’t gotta talk about it, what we do is proof

[Hook]
Yeah nobody has it down
They try to approach by example but nobody goes around
Yeah nobody has it down
And at the end of the day, they try to tell you how
Nobody has it down
Nobody really has it figured out
Nobody has it down
But me

[Verse 2]
Nobody has it down but me
On second thought they probably never will, trust me
I say these niggas couldn’t see me in the physical
Play my position and they condition is critical
We used to knock on these doors with the hopes of getting in
It’s residential cause every moment we living in
And that’s fantastic as fate would have it we feeling lit
Shorty I’m finna take you home in a little bit
Getting road head, we got drive
I’m a hop in the whip and grab a combo from Popeyes
And nobody is like me this shit’s kinda hard to describe
Hungry for recognition I needed a high five
Man success is so sweet I can taste it
I hit the blunt if it’s Kool Aid on that late shit
Still money is the best kind of fragrance
So you be smelling like shit if you never make it

[Hook]
