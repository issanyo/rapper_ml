[Verse 1]
Yeah, this is my Guinness flow I'm going for the world record
And after that I got the plan to see your girl naked
Winners road: MTV I could get a show
So I could showcase all the talents of my bigger bro
And I'm just rhymin' shout to everyone who follows me
Said I couldn't do it, shit, I accept your apology
They love you when you on, that's just human psychology
I be number one: how's that for numerology?
And I don't even know what I be saying, I be playing
This graffiti shit I'm spraying is the art I'm displaying
And trust me I'll be fine as long as the shorty play it
You could pass me the three then I'll Allen I gotta Ray it
Never fall I'm athletic ball-time
Guinness told me I got the longest flow of all time
I was rappin' it straight celly, don't call mine
And it was all fine, shit
They know I got that

[Hook]
Guinness flow, (uh, I said) Guinness flow, Guinness Flow
Like my nigga Chip said, we in this ho
Guinness flow, Guinness flow, Guinness Flow
Like my nigga Chip said, we in this ho

[Verse 2 ]
How could you rap for all 9 without failure?
And I respond I was smoking in the trailer
I'm a G, kind of like the Benz wagon G
Smoke rather neat, I be higher than dragon feet
I'm at its peak, doing here, we don't even need sessions
Representative telling me I got three seconds
Can't stop rapping or I be disqualified
Make the mic alive, we personified
And I'mma try. Yeah, I admit it, I'm kinda high
They try to sell me a product that I'm not tryna buy
Rapper: you should die reading Catcher in the Rye
Yeah I think large McDonalds: I gotta be superfry
Hey, yeah, I tell her saddle me
Horseback riding shorty, she could straddle me
Yeah, young chidds before I finish though
Let me go ahead and hit em with the Guinness Flow

[Hook]
Guinness flow, (uh, I said) Guinness flow, Guinness flow
Like my nigga Chip said, we in this ho
Guinness flow, Guinness flow, Guinness flow
Like my nigga Chip said, we in this ho (x2)
Guinness flow, Guinness flow, Guinness flow
We out this ho
