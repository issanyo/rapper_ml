[Hook: ELDee the Don]
I got your back and I'm always gonna hold you down, down
Even though sometimes it seems I'm never around yeah yeah
I'm on the road on tour but I promise I'll be back to you
It's you that I want to see, with you is where I wanna be
Always, Always, Always

[Verse 1: Chiddy]
They gotta love it here
This is something they could bop to
Noah asked me to do it, I said I got to
And, I used to dream about the mean girls
But I had to learn to pay attention in the free world
This life we live is fast so many days have passed
I need my boarding pass
Somebody pour a glass
Shout to The Roots, this is how I got over
I once was a kid somehow I got older
Now I'm deep man somehow I'm heat man
Infactuated with pretty Puerto Ricans
They call me Cubby when they want me, bring the seats in
I'm gonna make this shit fresh for you to eat in
And I'm just a chef in a kitchen, a jet's what we dip in
When we on the side of town
No matter what's next, intermission
It's you that we missin'
You know we gon' hold you down

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chiddy]
They say we back now
I never back down
First draft and they just made it in the last round
I treat the game like my chick, I'm gon' smash now
I'm at 'em early, no breakfast this shit is hash-browns
They say we go HAM, back to the program
Attending E! are my parties with Lindsay Lohan
They say with this success comes envy, I envy no man
On tracks, I'm barbarian, Conan
And still I'm so seasoned, I feel deepened
I keep that logic so she doesn't need a reason
Nigga half court shot with my eyes closed, heaving
It’s just a dirty game, that’s why I’m a heathen
But literally we making history
The way we twist the tree, the kids quick to see
This is me, I’m on the sixth degree
Doing major on them haters, they just little league
Like that

[Hook]
