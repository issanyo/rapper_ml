[Verse 1: Outasight]
Everybody dream about the money and cars and clothes and all that
Before you think Outasight happened overnight homie you better fall back
This years in the making took a whole lotta work with a whole lotta means
I didn’t ever get a call back, never was a draw back even with a short stack I was all in
I’m hustling, I’m busting in
What you think of me, I’m not interested
I shine you shine I’m so damn tired about your grind
We all got pills and we all like to chill
But shit gets real when the [?] gets ill
I play this straight
I got good karma
Don’t cheat don’t steal
Don’t cause no drama
Of all the actors who wanna be artists, wanna be the hardest
Ya'll just a part of this
From honors don’t get bothered I’d rather be modest

[Chorus]
Riding, riding, riding, riding, riding, riding around the city
I got my windows down and I wanna take you with me
So go and close your eyes and see the world is mine
I think its about that time that everybody shine
Shine your light
Shine your light
Shine your light on the world
Shine your light
Shine your light
Shine your light on the world

[Verse 2: Chiddy Bang]
Rolex my time is right
Think its time I go shine my light
Skateboard my grind is right
Hey girl you need to come find a light
Ride it tryna find it
Need a bad chick I get behind it
And my swag is sick you been reminded
Smoke with me, royal highness is us
Royal flush I’m just playing with these niggas like its fuckin' Toys 'R' Us
Boy I’m plush, and my seat back so just keep that, everything is fine
We done seen hate but Vaseline face we gonna shine
Now all these pretty hoes is hitting up my line
And Ima have to find a way to make her mine
My secret panty dropping weapon is the wine
What happens next is for another time
We’ll be fine, yup

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Outasight]
Oo so shine your light oo so extra bright
Make sure you find yourself before you’re found Outasight
Took a long while didn’t know it comes easy
Had some good friends, girlfriends who didn’t believe me
This ain't no victory lap, I don’t sleep I don’t nap
I’m just tryna do me and now you see where I'm at
And you should go and try and try and do the same
And take a ride with me on this memory lane… damn

[Chorus]
