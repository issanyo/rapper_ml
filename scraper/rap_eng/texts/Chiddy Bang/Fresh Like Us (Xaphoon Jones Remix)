[Intro: Yelle]
Parce que tu m'a eu
Comme une proie bête et gentille
Qui ne tire pas d'leçons
Du piége grossier et facile
D'un charmant garçon

[Verse 1: Chiddy]
Now let’s see, the boy’s so zesty, I’m fresh come get me
You don’t gotta know how I does it the best
And this is the guideline on how to keep fresh
Flow blue streak like Tulley, and I’m so gully
Rhyme so cold that it came with a skully
And them haters really love me
Cause they talk always seem to seep out like soda when it’s bubbly
Yea, I’m up there with a small arrow
Oh they mad cause I Shyne like Jamal Barrow?
And they say I’m so proud, but I’m like, I know
I do this thing nobly like Manu
Ten I know, grand like piano
Stack in my pocket, I could make it to the condo
I could take her and U2 like Bono
They say you got a point like Rajon Rondo

[Hook: Chiddy & (Theodore Grams)]
One, two, three, if you tryna’ get fresh like me (Ay, Ay)
One, two, three, if you tryna’ get fresh like me (Ay, It's the remix)
One, two, three, if you tryna’ get fresh like we (Ay, Ay)
One, two, three, if you tryna’ get fresh like we (Yeah, It's the remix)

[Verse 2: Theodore Grams]
Chiddy Bang, Xaphoon Jones, hey
Uh huh uh huh yep it's me
Pull and abort [?] on me
Chick magnet, where you sit on me
{?] wanna [?] on me
And every rapper in your hood wanna get like me
And every stunner in your hood wanna get like T
H-E-O-D-O-R-E
[?] voice [?] car keys
Get with me
My prerogative is something like
[?] I'm just trying to get with me
[?]
[?] like a G
So fast gotta pace yourself
It's a game so fast gotta scratch yourself
Like a vein drug drug in the system with them
I get bitches and remember I say this

[Hook: Chiddy & (Theodore Grams)]
One, two, three, if you tryna’ get fresh like me (Ay, Ay)
One, two, three, if you tryna’ get fresh like me (Ay, It's the remix)
One, two, three, if you tryna’ get fresh like we (Ay, Ay)
One, two, three, if you tryna’ get fresh like we (Yeah)
