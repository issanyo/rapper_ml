[Intro: Chiddy]
Uh huh
Yeah yeah
Oh yeah, uh
It's real life, it's real life

[Verse 1: Chiddy]
Yeah, it's real life
He wakes up with a feeling that ain't right
Try and get the funnel cake
All my niggas hungry and we got stomach aches
Ric Flair how prezzy the wrist wear
The city a ghost town 'cause nobody live there, yeah
What's the move gotta facilitate
South beach palm trees and rehabilitate
They be making earthquake I try and feel it shake
Said you was real, time always reveal a fake
Ain't shit safe unless we put money in
I need 20/20 Ms talking plenty Ms
On that Kendrick my nigga got it humble
Shit I figured out rap without a mumble
I'm that same nigga, whip lane switcher, shit the game sicker
When you gotta cut off certain people that came with ya
Bleach stain I remain nigga
Though my pain nigga oh so but young money like Lil Wayne nigga
Yeah, I ain't gon change nigga
I ain't gon change nigga, yeah

[Chorus: BeWill]
I need that proof
Hundred proof
Bottle of that truth
Of that truth
Cause I done came away now
And that truth
I need that proof
Hundred proof
Bottle of that truth
Of that truth
Cause we done came away now
And that truth, hey

[Verse 2: Chiddy]
Yeah, uh, it's real life
She wakes up with a feeling that ain't right
She a man eater, plan B-er, can't see her
We some grasshoppers, cash proper antiquer
I got high shit, watch this, that man FIFA
A trick or a hoe, I can't stand either
I got amnesia to you venomous snakes
I can tell you niggas ain't got it don't have what it takes
You a friend or a foe? You pretend for the show
Is you in it for the money or in it to grow?
And we getting back up if we all fall
Like LeMelo LiAngelo and Lonzo we all ball
Gotta protect your investment at all costs
Then transform like the off spark
You hot dog but what's your ballpark?
A beach house in Malibu a spot in Beverly Hills
Shit be sitting on acres you need a golf cart
That's how I play now
Reflecting like damn we came a long way now
Back on the grizzy and never satisfied
I'm just sitting at the table with the masterminds
Happy and passive I'm going after minds
Happy and slave I'm trying to master mine, yeah
Happy and slave I'm trying to master mine

[Outro: BeWill]
I need that proof
Hundred proof
Bottle of that truth
Of that truth
Cause I done came away now
Yeah tell the people calm down
I need that proof
Hundred proof
Bottle of that truth
Of that truth
Cause we done came away now
Yeah tell the people calm down, hey
