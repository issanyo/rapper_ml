[Verse 1: XV]
Now look at how the pinstripes suit ya
Baby wanna hop on that ass like Kunta
Baby you fly like Mario three super
Fell from the sky like a goomba
Feeling up that brazzie-brazzie Luca
Trying to hold back but I read ya, Hoosier
Looking at your eyes, go hard like Medusa
Never been a floosy, you just always flew up
I try to say bye but you just throw the deuce up
Trying to hear my line but I just always lose ya
We go at it like Bloods and Hoovers
But we do it in the city of Yakuzas
You are make it hot, let me cut like I didn't pick paper/rock
Wake up without your car in a vacant lot
Red light, yellow light, slow, the green light’s on and…

[Hook]
She go, I go, she go, I go, she go, I go
So I never get to see when…
She go, I go, she go, I go, she go, I go
I don’t know where I’m gonna be when…
She go, I go, she go, I go, she go, I go
So I never get to see when…
She go, I go, she go, I go, she go, I go
I don’t know where I’m gonna be when she go
Let the song play, just let the song play, let the song play

[Verse 2: XV]
Baby you should get in bed then
I got a warm pillow you can lay your head in
But we gotta get up and chase that dough like the gingerbread man
It’s like seven minutes in heaven
And I just want one more session
So I tie you up like the neck of Les Nessman
Then I eat you up like a delicatessen
Damn you fly, Jane Jetson and you do it like it’s your profession
Hit the store and blue cheese like dressing
Cooler than a senior, newer than a freshman
You my new obsession even though we ain’t progressing
‘Cause you gotta leave and I gotta leave
And we don’t ever-ever ask questions ‘cause when…

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chiddy Bang]
She go, I go
Just another girl caught up in the world that raised me
And I’m aiming for the heart
But you gotta play it smart to make the girls go crazy
Do that, it’s a new rap and yo, those double D’s got me in a boob trap
J. Cole when I seen her I say who dat
And she love the way I’m live like a Roots track
Hey girl, I’m in a quest for your love
And all that weak shit sound extra to us
She would love me if my name wasn’t next to the buzz
‘Cause she was still there when that nigga was catching a bus
And I think that it’s right to be said
You gotta learn how to live life on the edge
I’m the number one man with a cumbersome plan
And that’s to make love with my number one fan

[Hook]
