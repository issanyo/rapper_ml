[Verse 1]
Young kid tryna make that grown man dough
No navigation, but there no where that I can't go
Shit, this beat knock like Kimbo
And whats this shit? boom, change up the tempo
We be in the car, roll and crack a window
Shit you always feel good of the endo
And I made this for them Hollywood bimbos
And do I really need a motherfucking intro?
Show up to the venue
Food is on the menu
And if it ain't the menu
Then buy out what they send you
They hook us up with sour
Performing in an hour
And give me 23 more, I'll be Jack Bauer
Hop in the line and we cut to the front
Then I proceed to have a shorty roll me a blunt
I say that if you're swelly you can never be stopped
I'm in the kinda mood just to get whatever I want

[Hook]
It's whatever we want
We can do whatever we want, we can get whatever we want
It's whatever we want
We can do whatever we want, we can get whatever we want
It's whatever we want, whatever we want
We can do whatever we want, we can get whatever we want
It's whatever we want

Give it here
Give it here
Give it here
Give it here
Give it here

[Verse 2]
I said who down to get drunk
Smelling through Mr. Le Pew
I gotta pound of that skunk
Yea and I think I could get anything that I want
Shorty she got a fatty I could see it from the front
The bottles is a must
The models should be touched
And if I get her tipsy she'll be swallowing my nuts
She wasn't around when I was following the bus
I don't care if she down to do what I say without a fuss
Yea tonight could get a little outrageous
Me and my niggas just be picking our favorites
Yea, right off the ground I get her
Up for the evening and she down for whatever

[Hook]
