[Hook: The Knocks]
We don’t care
We don’t care
We don’t care if the sun comes up
We don’t care if the sun comes up
We don’t care if the sun comes up
Cause you know we’ll be dancing with the DJ
We don’t care if the sun comes up
Cause you know we’ll be dancing with the DJ
Come tonight, I’m gonna find your love
And we can have a party just the two of us yeah

[Intro: Chiddy]
Praises be
To the almighty Xaphoon Jones, The Knocks, Chiddy

[Verse 1: Chiddy]
She came to dance insane, to go
To a level that I never ever seen before
Start this, small kiss, that’s lean the walk
Tell the dike I'd turn her like Tina though
And I seen the glow in your eyes
Give me them wings, give me them thighs
High in the penthouse we can just rise
Told her I’m a star and I’m up in these skies
Enough of these guys, talking how they really gonna do it
You try and get the Benz, they try and get the Buick
So come in girl, I'm where you gotta be
And I’m one in a million, no lottery
I got game that’s EA proof
And she told me to come over by the DJ booth
I’m in the DJ booth, I rock PJs loose
I want that Absolut power and I don’t mean Grey Goose
I got it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chiddy]
So try to dance to this, and find ‘mance to this
And later on when you try and find cannabis
Like 'em all, but I'm crushin' on tanner chicks
And they always just want gifts on some Santa shit
Seen one of those that night, she had her back right
She had the leggings that killed it up in the black tights
And I’m never slipping, even on black ice
I’m in the front so they always try and back bite
But anyway, back to you
And I think you got a good sense of fashion too
Your man cool but you need a little passion too
Made a Mountain out of nothin', bitch pass the Dew
I’m just trying to catch breeze like a pass from Drew
Sip a couple sangrias if I happen to
Girl we gotta get ghost and she say poof
Then she started goin' over to the DJ booth now that's wild

[Hook]

[Outro: Chiddy]
We can just keep goin'
We can just keep goin'
Uh, we gonna be here all night, I swear
Still make it in time for Breakfast
