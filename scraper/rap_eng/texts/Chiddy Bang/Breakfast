[Verse 1]
Yeah, getting high's in my regiment
I said clear they have a speech impediment
I'm with a very posh girl that's elegant
How do you dumb it down when you highly intelligent
I'm finna based the flow, give 'em a rare move
Ground humble but fly and I'm eatin' air food
Nigerian American, moments I'm cherishing
Hear that weak shit and there's no comparison
But could I ever be next to be Nas?
Haters is spying on me, I don't fuck with espionage
Life's a bitch, she could be ugly as sexy Minaj
The Recipe's odds and most never would less of be Oz, yeah
Uh, I'm feeling flyer than I've ever been
Flyer than 'em cause we flying where they've never been
Yeah, still feeling incredible
I got that good health, smoking on medical

[Verse 2]
Hey yo the flow is OK
And I'm serving up breakfast, you know it goes with OJ
I don't care about haters I'm what your hoes finna play
And my train of thought's making me tell a soul sister "hey"
Yeah, she's on another level, and I am impressed
But she might just be a devil in a new dress
I got 'em hatin', waitin' what I'mma do next
Chicks let me slam 'em like wrestlers I can suplex
Too fake, but really I say I'm too fresh
I don't even sweat her but I bet she give my crew neck
Yeah, uh, I'm just swellin' on 'em
I don't hear 'em yeah I'm bout to go Hellen on 'em
Get the BasedGod, call Ellen on 'em
We give it to 'em for cheaper, we wholesellin' on 'em

They think they steppin' up, they are on the StairMaster
