[Bad Day sample: Darwin Deez]
Everday oughta be a bad day for you

[Chiddy:]
That's right, uh

[Verse 1: Chiddy]
We used to be so strong
Back then we was right, now we so wrong
She was Beyonce, I could've got my Hov on
And when she hang up on me, I tell her hold on
Quit that shit, I don't use force
Today is a bad day, we've been divorced
When I think about stress, I don't really need it
But this is plagiarism, cause my shortie just cheated
And shortie conceited
(She out of her mind, I wish she had Louis and a card in decline)
She had school with no aid, no HIV
Hope you don't get in the club with that fake ID
Why would you hurt somebody that you called your man for?
And I hope you get evicted by your landlord
But, she be messin' with me
And I'm hoping she lose my number indefinitely
So

[Bad Day sample: Darwin Deez]
Everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you

THEODORE GRAMS:
I guess you can't remember all the times that I was there
Your emotions on a roller coaster, no fun fair
You had me on the phone, but hate me when I come there
Xaphoon, let's cut it down to a drum snare
Yeah, yeah, just like that
I hope I hope you go deaf so you can't hear shit
Yeah, I hope I hope you go blind
Cause you look me in the face and you laugh when I cry

[Bad Day sample: Darwin Deez]
Maybe you should wonder why your apartment is always so empty
(Maybe you should wonder that)
Well I hope you get locked out of that apartment and have to call Jenny
(Ohh, I hope you get locked out)

[Bad Day sample: Darwin Deez]
Cause everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you

[Verse 2: Chiddy]
She's way too complex
When we argue, she takin' shit out of context
And, I know I could have did more
But I'm never home, I was always on tour
I could be anywhere in the world, had one wish
To be with you until you gave that dude a tongue kiss
And this is hard for me to say like a tongue twist
My heart don't beat for you so let the drum hit
And, you know I just got promoted
Now I be the boss and I hope you get demoted
Hapiness is a warm gun, live it fully loaded
And shit got worse when I exploded
Boom, I wrote it soon, I hope you brought a cab pay
And I hope you get detention on a half day
I wish I could use your blouse for an ashtray
Cause for you, everyday should be a bad day

[Bad Day sample: Darwin Deez]
Everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you

[Chiddy:]
Xaphoon you crazy
But so am I

Everday oughta be a bad day for you

Everday oughta be a bad day for you
