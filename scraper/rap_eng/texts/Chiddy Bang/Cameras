[Verse 1]
Can I take a picture and ask for the permission?
And you don’t really have to, homie it’s your decision
So nervous, showing your friends is the only purpose
And you just wanted something that would make it all worth it
Well here’s a ticket, I would gladly oblige
You saw me from afar so a scheme you had to devise
And I said baby you fine, had some things on my mind
You slip me your number, said call me at a moment in time
Don’t mind if I do, hashtag time is money
So I’m focused on putting some extra paper in my cashbag
If I was broke bummy, that would be inadequate
But if they trying to get swelly, then I’m the advocate
Shit it’s a piece of cake, oven full easy bake
Used to steal my brother’s carD, now I’m not gon’ need a fake
It’s Peanut Butter And Swell
We just living in the moment if you can’t tell

[Hook: Matt and Kim]
No time for cameras
We’ll use our eyes instead
No time for cameras
We’ll be gone when we’re dead
No time for cameras
We’ll use our eyes instead
I see flashes of gold

[Verse 2]
Ayo the cameras was ill, that was a great look
If I accept you, please don’t tag me on Facebook
I know you trying to be personable
But you don’t gotta hit the tag to feel personal
Yeah these days, pussy, money, weed, need three things
Shit I’m prepared to grapple with whatever these brings
Spazzing on tracks at home, on calm things
And planning getaway dates with your girl in Palm Springs
But that’s neither here nor there, we be flying everywhere
Yeah I am the pilot of the newly launched Swelly Air
And what city are we headed to and where’s the telly there?
We gon’ need some dutches there, we gon’ hit the deli there
That’s if you’re wondering, fanfare humbling
I be on my Twitter shit, she be on Tumbling
And it’s fine Matt & Kim, this is just a sample I
Ripping the stages then dealing with all the camera time

[Hook: Matt and Kim]
No time for cameras
We’ll use our eyes instead
No time for cameras
We’ll be gone when we’re dead
No time for cameras
We’ll use our eyes instead
I see flashes of gold
