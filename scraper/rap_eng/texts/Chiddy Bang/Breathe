[Verse 1]
Sit back and just breathe
Sit back, everything we did that once we twist that
We gon' get so high like where a blimp at
I wrestle with these niggas
We bringing them total impact
I am that, I even sing with my vocal intact
Somethings missing when there’s no food up in the fridge
Auntie just came over so you know she brought the kids
And thinking bout my homies, man I love them and I miss them
Crazy how your moms used to struggle with addiction
New money motherfuck government assistance
We gonna keep itchin', we gonna keep inching
Closer to they dreams, holsters in they jeans
If Dennis doing time, how he suppose to raise a queen
Just a question I'm asking
We already been trappin, need the whole pie
Never the fraction, forever we stacking
Earthquakes, they shake but don’t bleed
Sit back and just breathe

[Hook]
All the roads we walk (All the roads we walk)
All the friends that we meet (All the friends that we meet)
Gotta keep your head up (Gotta keep your head up)
Sit back and just breathe (Sit back and just breathe)
All the things we see (All the things we see)
Living life on the street (Living life on the street)
Gotta keep your head up (Gotta keep your head up)
Sit back and just breathe (Sit back and just breathe)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, ain’t nothing changing ya
Jersey boy switched up, moved to Pennsylvania
And he hopped on a train and went to Philly
Young niggas was wildin' in the city acting silly
Moves that I’m making when I was in high school
Found an application and I’m trying to rhyme too
And I’m trying to shine too, haters like the swine flu
Can’t see it but what it is til it’s behind you
Few of them accepted me but most of them rejected me
Then something got the best of me
Telling me to invest in me
So then I search like how I’m gonna get it though
Four years of my life, don’t wanna be miserable
Fuck it chose Drexel, now they trying to sue me though
Only real reason that I went was for the studio
Yo, not to mention gotta pay for the housing
But that shit cost 35 thousand, Damn

[Hook]

[Outro]
All the roads we walk
All the friends that we meet
You gotta keep your head up
Sit back and just breathe
All the things we see
Living life on the street
Sit back and just breathe
