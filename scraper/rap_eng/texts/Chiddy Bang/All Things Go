[Verse 1]
It started off with a rhyme and a dream
Made it the greatest and the latest, now we fresh on the scene
Got the sample for the kids; won’t you ever grow up?
Went to Drexel and had classes, but I never showed up
I was writing all day 'til my hands would hurt
Professors didn’t appreciate it, called me a jerk
New boy need to learn, but I never would
Pay attention in school is something that I never could, uh
And know with a beat, gotta be steaming
And we could work wonders over logic and reason
We on the hype, now they call it a buzz
And how we get the party popping, Baltimore club, uh
MySpace they could replay next
And you gotta have Xaph for the DJ set
No matter how they ever play us, they can never replace us
And any way you slice it now, homey, they can't take us

[Hook - Sufjan Stevens]
You came to take us, all things go, all things go
To recreate us, all things grow, all things grow
We had our minds set, all things known, all things known
You had to find it, all things go, all things go

[Verse 2]
Say hello to the game, the people know my name
And do they really love us or is this just a fling?
And we be Peter Parker in love with the Mary Jane
So many people gone, so many people came
And, this that brand new spontaneous
Dope flow, intravenous, miscellaneous grinding
Better late than never, I’m calling it perfect timing
But we gon’ have a little bit of fun cause when it’s all done
You throw your sneaks up and call it a good run
I admit, that I would never rather them burn me
I don’t know where I’m headed, but I know it’s a journey
And my bags is packed, so can you hand me my itinerary?
I get attention like a soldier in the military
This is what you gotta notice today
We promise to make sure they never throw us away

[Hook]
