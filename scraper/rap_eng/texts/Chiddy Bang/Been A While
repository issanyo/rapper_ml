[Hook]
It's been a while since I see ya
It's been a while since I heard from ya
It's been a while since I checked back in
And I ain't heard a word from ya

[Verse 1]
It's been a while since I was in it
I hit it and then I pushed it to the limit
Oh, shit I wonder what you do now
Shit I wonder who you do now
My ex bitch, yes she moved on
She bad and boujee like Grey poupon
I can't say but you thought I'm Superman
I'm smarter than that, thought I was stupid man
New edition, but I'm a veteran
I feel fresher than I have ever been
I fly places them niggas never been
At the door you gotta let him in
I feel like my niggas could do Letterman
I prefer Tequila for my medicine
Stick to the script and watch it pan out
Now I gotta reach them with that hands out

[Bridge]
Touchdown, throw it in the end zone
I evacuated the friendzone
Now I'm gettin' ends though
Family all that matters, we like the Winslows
And everytime the wind blows
I just wonder where did my friends go
I just wonder where did my ends go
I just wonder where did my friends go

[Hook]
It's been a while since I see ya
It's been a while since I heard from ya
It's been a while since I checked back in
And I ain't heard a word from ya

[Verse 2]
Stay down to it
In a circle so small they gotta come around to it
We was skatin' on thin ice and then we found music
In the studio, don't they got a nice sound to it
I used to ride around the city in a brown Buick
See I owe you but I just didn't get around to it
I done mix my emotions and I switch things
I done swerved on them haters and I switch lanes
New edition but I'm a veteran
I feel fresher than I have ever been
I fly places them niggas never been
At the door you gotta let him in
I took my family out of deficit
We flyin' regardless what the weather is
Movin' up, Jeffersons
Piss greatness and shit excellence

[Hook]
It's been a while since I see ya
It's been a while since I heard from ya
It's been a while since I checked back in
And I ain't heard a word from ya
