[Verse 1]
Everybody's simple then and these niggas is simpletons
Tell them bitches fall back, just like they was limboin'
We still got a Acura but show time we be limoin'
Rest in peace to the dad, bring that white widow in
Chiddy's '90s baby, it ain't gold and shiny baby
She been tryin' to buy me lately
Got a temper tiny baby
Yeah, swelly is just a movement, hope you understand that
Yo, Xaph, it's crazy how we sample on that hand-clap
And that's quite amazing if they ask me
Shit, does somebody have a L that they could pass me?
I upgraded to a little more classy
I guess I got this in the bag, we should have tea
English girls, English girls, shorty said she came in part
To the fact I'm good with words, yeah I got them language arts
Cruisin' by the ocean cause I know this is a game of sharks
Music and money, bet I never let it change my heart

[Hook]
Oh oh ooh oh, I just came to party

[Verse 2]
Grind don't stop, I'm on top
Liquor closes 9 o'clock
And they say I'm dripping swell, somebody should find a mop
I be where it's sunny then I'm touring where the climate drops
Watch for police then hit boutiques like it is time to cop
Yeah, I'm just trying to park, so can I find my spot?
Parents complainin' sayin' we don't spend time a lot
I'm super chill, but I think that's just the pot in me
Plus we be feelin' like that movie that they gotta see
So, who hot as me? Take a bitch on a Oddyssey
We just smoke a lot of tree, it's good for the economy
Yeah I'm still up on my grizzly, Mike Conley
That was just a preview, cause they got nothing on we
Fresh whenever comin' out, mixtape laundry
Started off a van, elevated to an R&V
Their competitors got upset that they were doing so well and coming up so quickly, a bit like the crooning in an R&B track
Cause when your shit get in their face it really ain't hard to see

[Hook]
