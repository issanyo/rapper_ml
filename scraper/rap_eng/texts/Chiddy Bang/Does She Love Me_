[INTRO]

[Verse 1]
Is he moving too fast? Is she moving too slow?
She telling me that I'm silly, but I'm only 2-0
And it sucks that she just want to be friends with me
I try to put her on where I'm at mentally
I'm full of energy
At times I need a remedy
For lack of things that interest me
But still her body is tempting me
She just keep rejecting me
Why she keep stressing me?
Screaming like "Don't touch me bitch, I don't got leprosy"
Maybe we wasn't meant to be
But I was down Bonnaroo, Tennessee
In the RV, I can shut down a stage
Casey had the veggies on the bus, we smoked a pound of haze
Digress the tree can cold stress
When you feeling a bad bitch, but she showing you no interest
Sending letters with no address
And she never gon' get it so let it rest

[Hook x2]
Does she love me?
No sir
Does she want me?
No sir
I think she hates me
What has she done for me lately?

[Verse 2]
I'm high with no intent to land
I seem to fall for the girls with the short attention spans
Who just wanna rendezvous
I would take her on a date, to a nice restaurant
But I got too much on my plate
Said I'm here for a day
She hit me three hours late
Found out I left the city, bet she had the sour face
Told her I would kick it with her whenever I return
But that was based on the premise that she was my concern
Searching for serious, life
Then I was fast
Had me speeding on this racetrack, furious
The kinda chick, the flyest nigga in the school he had her
But eff that, I'm trying to focus on what truly matters
I like em usually bad, always on punishment
Having a conversation, wishing I could punish it
And why the fantasy so far from the truth, huh?
Running in circles playing Duck, Duck, Goose, huh?
We take the shit any slower, then we gonna hold up traffic
Only hit the blunt once, then she fuckin' pass it
I knew we wasn't compatible
Quarterback my feelings to the side, that's a lateral
I wish that I could be satisfied
I wish you would let me have a try
But there's a problem with you and I
Now its Chi-town, do or die

[Hook]
