Ray Charles
Ooo, boy, open your eyes
A girl like me ain't waiting all night
Ooo, boy, better think twice
I got that honey, that sugar, that spice
Ray Charles

[Verse 1]
C'yeah, a yo I'm feeling like Ray Charles
Tell the Giants, man somebody better save y'all
Cause we got it and New England is the craziest
So make noise for the home team Patriots
I'm throwing passes that's precise like Tom Brady
It's only right I got a super model for my lady
And we so fly, the cameras know I
Am super cool, the Super Bowl, I'm Jam'n 45
Yeah, let's get the win then we outski
Shout my homie Rob Gronkowski
The Giants is going down, don't doubt me
Belichick, yeah, you know what we 'bout G
Uh, and that goes without a question
'Bout to get that revenge for 2007
Yeah, and the truth is cold
Indianapolis, the Pats got the Super Bowl

[Hook]
Got my black shades on
Smoke it 'till it's gone
Head to the sky
Feeling so on
Ray Charles, I'm Ray Charles
Ray Charles, I'm Ray Charles
Got my black shades on
Dancing to my song
Looking so fly
Feeling so on
Ray Charles, I'm Ray Charles
Ray Charles, I'm Ray Charles

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And I think I'm preheated, oven
They hear me spit, they think they know me like they cousin
But it's okay, we at the door that mean's we're buzzin'
Now that's McDonald's and baby I think I'm lovin', it
But you know that size doesn't fit
MC Hammer with this shit, like why the fuck would I quit
Let's hire 40 people and get like 40 cars
And I wouldn't even drive cause I would be Ray Charles
See us and say, "Whattup?" like how the fuck is he talkin'
He don't even trip, like how the fuck is he walkin'
I'm blind man, yeah, like the Three Blind Mice
And them haters, I'mma throw it on 'em
Tell 'em I don't need no walkin' stick, my shit costs a grip
I get out the mouthwash if you talkin' shit
And I can hear the evil, but I won't see it
And if the blunt go out, you better reheat it
