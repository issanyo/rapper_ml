Drow has it and peers,  Swelly meet me at the peers
The flow cutting edge all I'm missing is some shears
I got the game mirrored and it's closer than appears
And most of you are local to you artists up in here
Wow, Bragodocious, flow hocus pocus, your planes been grounded and then we're flying like the lotus
I'm an energizer, an enterpriser as known the real bit's on the synthesizer
Ok, God, you wanna play God, it's always sunny in Philly they see some great skies
Thank the lord for my blessings like I was baptized
Got the blackest thought shout to my rap ties, yeah
And it's the flow for the stadium, Son they call me Chiddy, you probably heard me on Radio 1
This my clause, connected like coordinates, we are not the same homie, you are my subordinate

You know where he go, no I don't think so, you got a red light to your headlight that's why you think slow
And me I just flow , another level well, and if you're feeling me then let me hear your rebel yell
Cause he's a rebel

Shout to the labels that doubted me, now they out for me married into this shit

Now I feel like I need a gallery
Purple plants that we happened to smell of flowers, we crushing the competition
Cause cowardice is cowardly, I'm moving on son, now I'm the bomb son
If you don't like me then you probably on the wrong one

And this the music they've been dying to hear, was in Africa but I never seen the lions and bears
Now I'm riding them where, and I'm flying the car, my life is opposite than when you said I wasn't a star
I be collecting and rapping these artists are so upsetting
Frat flow, I rush day all get to stepping
Oh, feel like I'm good but the sun is evil, flow shit like Adam Sandler in Funny People
And I should carry needles, cause they cut is lethal
And I master my bars, you're just a paralegal”

That line was messed up
You know where he go, no I don't think so, you got a red light to your headlight that's why you think slow
And me I just flow , another level well, and if you're feeling me then let me hear your rebel yell
Cause he's a rebel
