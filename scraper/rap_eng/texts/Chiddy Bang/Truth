[Intro: Chiddy]
Is anybody there?
I mean I hope somebody out there can hear this right here
Just listen

[Chorus: Passion Pit Sample & (Chiddy)]
You’re gonna drive me crazy (don’t do that)
You’re gonna drive me mad (don’t do that)
Better things are coming
I said there’s truth in that

[Verse 1: Chiddy]
Ayo, what better things can you hear them sing?
Ain’t this like a celebration?
Switch gears to the top we steer
Notice my acceleration
I do it for the have not’s
For the boy playing ball on the block
Xaphoon told me that this was the shot
So I stopped skipping math
But I came with a plot
Plot, I’ve prolly moved onto my next axis
And if she calling
I don’t care bout what my ex asks
Why?
Cause I’m in a lab like Bill Nye the Science Guy
Flyer than fly, I could jump over top of
The Empire State building, just glide

[Chorus: Passion Pit Sample & (Chiddy)]
You’re gonna drive me crazy (don’t do that)
You’re gonna drive me mad (don’t do that)
Better things are coming
I said there’s truth in that

[Verse 2: Chiddy]
Harder to fail
You see a train
Don’t be the fool that jumps on the rail
High on the scale
If I nail, girl say
I am well endowed like Harvard and Yale
Ladies man, Jesse Katsopolis
I’m getting shows booked, I’ll be the novelist
Superman, metropolis
I profit off my topic hits
Periodically, I’m in my element
Phosphorus, I prosperous
Say we loud and too rockerish
Pro, how long are you lockin’ this?
I say until apocalypse, I got this shhh

[Chorus: Passion Pit Sample & (Chiddy)]
You’re gonna drive me crazy (don’t do that)
You’re gonna drive me mad (don’t do that)
Better things are coming
I said there’s truth in that

[Bridge: Chiddy]
Is anybody there?
I mean I hope somebody out there can hear this right here
Just listen
I say until apocalypse, I got this shhh

[Outro: Passion Pit Sample & (Chiddy)]
You’re gonna drive me crazy (don’t do that)
You’re gonna drive me mad (don’t do that)
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin’ hairpins outta glass
Baby, don’t be unhappy
Baby,don’t be said
Better things are coming
I swear there’s truth in that (don’t do that)
