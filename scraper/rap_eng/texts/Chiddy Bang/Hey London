[Sample]

[Verse 1]

We finally made it
Celebration in order, happy belated
This what you waitin' for, you know we make it raw
London City we love you, that's who made it for

In my heart you will remain, hope that this trip makes for picturesque change
And we on a jet plane, platinum dreams gladly go
This that Beatles feel, remember Abbey Road?
Show out with the words, what a antic
And we got the wifi, Virgin Atlantic
Turbulence can't disrupt my pen
And I swear's my time, say what up Big Ben
I'mma up this trend and live it up as a teen
To go to the palace to say 'what up' to the Queen
Hit up Westwood, do interviews porb'ly take calls
University of Cambridge May Ball
Get your ticket ready, it's Chiddy Bang in London
They can never bring me down I'm always up to somethin'
Contrary to your beliefs I'm still the same dude
Only difference is the pilots' talk 'n' plane food

[Hook]

Hey London
I know you've prob'ly never seen me before
And though I'd love to stay and kick it some more
I gotta get back on my tour
So the only thing I gotta say's
Hey London
You gotta know I love you for sure
Just let me in cuz you opened the door
If I gotta get back on my tour
The only thing I gotta say is

[Verse 2]

And the bosses on we head
Now say what up when we across the pond
Yeezy said "Jesus Walks", my cross is on
Dream of a residence that's heaven-sent,a loft upon

Less serious raps, I'm what you call a clown
I'm the raft if ever your bridge fallin' down
Drive on opposite I take those roads play right
I'll prob'ly take her to Shakespeare's Globe

If the world get cold then we numb to the reality
I break life into pieces, let's hit the gallery
My you're platinum baby you're not sterling
Rollercoaster ride, London Eye, Merlin
From you they tried to block me like Berlin
And this that silk flow I bring to you, Persian
My G's stitched like LiLo
And by the way, meet me at Heathrow

[Hook]

Hey London
I know you've prob'ly never seen me before
And though I'd love to stay and kick it some more
I gotta get back on my tour
So the only thing I gotta say's
Hey London
You gotta know I love you for sure
Just let me in cuz you opened the door
If I gotta get back on my tour
The only thing I gotta say is
