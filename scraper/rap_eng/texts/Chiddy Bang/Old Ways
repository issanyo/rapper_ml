[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah
And how the saying go, things change
Skinny dude, but the flow is the size of Ving Rhames
Pennies from my thoughts add up, I hope you bring change
I know these haters ain't want me to see my wings raised
Flowin' shoes polishin', rappers I demolish it
I done lost my mind, in need of a psychologist
They could care less back when I was still in colleges
And now the boy be in London, Theophilus
It's tough tryin' to end up on the paid route
The flow is medium rare, now bring the steak out
This is my medium, here, see how it plays out
They all buggin' me, I gotta pull the Raid out
Using it sparingly, forever will they cherish me
Before I black out, introduce my moment of clarity

[Hook]
I'm not the same, style change
But I can't leave the game
Now I'm right back to my old ways
I take life so slow, every minute gotta go
Now I'm right back to my old ways
We only here for a little
So I'm somewhere in the middle
And I'm right back to my old ways
I'm not the same, style change
But I can leave the game
Now I'm right back to my old ways

[Verse 2]
Let's take 'em back to days when we had no radio plays
And we had to change up our ways, cause success breeds
Difference, try to keep it clean
While they litterin', snakes in the grass, they try to slither in
The rose that grew from concrete, not witherin'
And it's life so fast, the lights keep flickerin'
What goes around comes back, and that's the karma truth
I log onto my closet, that shit is Karmaloop
So I get a little fresh
My teachers used to hate me, but now I could pass the test
Got confidence, subconciousness
Makes me overlook all of my many accomplishments
But, see I get it like nobody else did
I found a deeper meaning, of what sense of self is
And I'mma die of old age
And stay true I reverted back to my old ways

[Hook]
