[Hook/Intro: Joe Strummer]
All your life dreamed a dream
Somehow connected with the silver screen
All your life dreamed a dream
Somehow connected with the silver screen

[Verse 1: Chiddy Bang]
And yeah I’m back on the scene
Making with a dream them haters they gonna scheme
Like, silver screen that’s all I ever dreamt of
And the day I lose, that’ll be the end of
My journey, tryna focus on ambition
Cause other successes do not concern me
But still I Mac like Bernie
I’m in it rappers, they say we can win a tourney
Now I’m drowning in the page
They don’t understand me, they say I’m hard to gage
Still blowin’ up, take the pin off the grenade
You’re frivolous I’m Nicolas rather me in the Cage
Never, these rappers gonna stay in trouble
Get the US Open like we playin doubles
Hustle for the prettiest screen
Make sure you’re wide a wake in the city of dreams

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chiddy Bang]
And this is my soundtrack
Takin’ off, no plan, you can’t ground that
I’m high grade like smokers that don’t do regs
Life’s a movie better hope it ain’t a bootleg
Stay focused, don’t rigmarole
Responsibility you gotta feed the fish in the bowl, uh
Play it humble, really though I seem rash
Thought I’d catch the people back like a Dreamcast
Play the role, get the scene cast
And tomorrow’s always brighter with the green hash
And I’m 20 below
Could make it to the awards with some strummin’ from Joe
They feel it but can’t repeat it so they hummin’ the flow
I’m up-tempo, might as well be drummin’ the show, uh
And I’m blazin’ it right
Think you Swift well I’m Yeezy cause I’m taking the mic
Yeah
