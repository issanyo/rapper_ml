[Hook]
If you ever see me talking to myself
I'm just, running through the words I have to say to you
Is it over or is it too soon to tell?
I'm just, trying not to push myself away from you

[Verse 1]
I know we arguing, I know we fight a lot
You always think I'm wrong, I think I'm right a lot
And when you see me, don't I always make your day?
You from BK but you can't always have it your way
She wanna hit the city, ripping the mall
I always seem to be busy, she expecting my call
The fast life could make us happy, it's upsettin' us all
Cause all the anniversaries, forgettin' 'em all
But don't be mad love, I know it's sad love
She Jolie but it's Pittiful, that's that Brad love
What happens when it all goes wrong, we was nice, generosity
And impossibly enough, it's animosity
I think I gotta just change up my game plan
Cause she ain't down to fall back in love with the same man
But no matter the weather or what the rain bring
At the end I'm coming back for the same thing

[Verse 2]
Yeah, shorty just vanished on me
She disappeared and yet I do not have no damage on me
Sometimes I feel she's a burden I can't manage on me
She say I'm cocky cause I got all of the cameras on me
But is it my fault, or is it your self-esteem?
That got you feeling like you're a prisoner to my dream
Parents just don't understand, and neither do y'all
You wanna hype me up and leave me there but I don't blue ball
And I say blue ball, just to tell you what them guys will teach you any day
And then you left but fuck it I don't need you anyway
The mentality of love gone wrong, (yeah)
To work it out but we just don't get along, (yeah)
I know it's messed up, we all, affected
Tryin to get through, and the call, rejected
Ain't that a shame, if I was ever close to your fragile frame
I'd be looking for the words, playing Scrabble games

[Bridge]
Now everybody say
Oh oh oh oh oh
Ohhh
Oh oh la la
Now everybody say
'Round and 'round we go baby
No no no no no, no no
Ooohh, yeah
Now everybody say
