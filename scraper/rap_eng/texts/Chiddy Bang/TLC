[Intro]
Yeah
This for the people that supported me
You know what I'm saying?
The ones that held me down, all the way (hey)
You know I see y'all
They say greatness takes a while, so here we are

[Hook]
We been through
Where would I be without you
Now that's cool, that's cool, that's cool, that's cool, that's cool
We been through
Where would I be without you
Now that's cool, that's cool, that's cool, that's cool, that's cool

[Verse 1]
They fuck with me from opposites
Opposites attract
Since the day I signed my deal
Man, they had my back
I love y'all for that
Y'all only making me stronger
Y'all tellin' me that bags claim can't take any longer
But me and Xaph parted ways
Bags came the plane got delayed
All I know is that he should've stayed
Missed some shows that we should've played
Now we goin' our separate ways
Now I gotta just step away
Now I got a whole gang of fans
Think about them everyday, everyday, everyday

[Hook]
We been through
Where would I be without you
Now that's cool, that's cool, that's cool, that's cool, that's cool
We been through
Where would I be without you
Now that's cool, that's cool, that's cool, that's cool, that's cool

[Verse 2]
Wanna thank you for your love
Wanna thank you for your hugs
Wanna thank you for the roof and the clothes on my back
Wanna thank you for your touch
Wanna thank you very much
If you ever need love I know you know where I'm at
Where would I be, without y'all?
We family, and that's how it is
That's how it's always gonna be
Ain't shit finna change

[Hook]
We been through
Where would I be without you
Now that's cool, that's cool, that's cool, that's cool, that's cool
We been through
Where would I be without you
Now that's cool, that's cool, that's cool, that's cool, that's cool
