[Verse 1]
Tonight I’m acting up
We step out to get daps to us
And them tracks you know I lap it up
Spit the new shit, yeah thats enough
I made it, say what the shit are we?
Now it's time to get wasted
And we probably get drunk on Broadway
In the broad day so blatant
Like look at me, in the castle is crooks with me
Think about twenty to book with me
And I just kick shit like Booker T
Cook it B, so while I’m over served
I’m in your girl mouth about over her
At least I get to make the most of her
Then I be like Casper, a ghost to her
Yeah Chidd, you can look me up on Wikipedi
Most of these chicks is needy, and I’m feeling baked, the ziti
Fuck it I make this PD, yeah that’s that cracka crack
Yeah I’m feelin good, if I say it that’s where I’m actually at
Roll up, roll up, every night
Sip it, sip it, that is right
Let me run that midnight train, she be on her Gladys Knight
And since the night calls, I hit the green button
You think my old shit hard? You ain’t seen nothing

[Hook]
You ain’t seen nothing
You ain’t seen nothing
You think my old shit hard?
You ain’t seen nothing
You ain’t seen nothing
You ain’t seen nothing
You think my old shit hard?
You ain’t seen nothing
You ain’t seen nothing
You ain’t seen nothing
You think my old shit hard?
You ain’t seen nothing
You ain’t seen nothing
You ain’t seen nothing
You think my old shit hard?
You ain't seen nothing

[Verse 2]
That’s standard, hand her
To my bro in the stand thur
You ain’t got no friends girl
Last time we had ten girls
I need twin girls, identical
Yo Xaph I think the beat cynical
Sip Rosé and Absolut, but I’m just at the pinnacle
And I think I’m invincible
So every single chick pimpable
I ain’t too sure, but I does me
Mi amore, mi amore, yeah they love me
I’m lookin for a bad bitch, above average
That be killing LA like the Mavericks
She be down to Miami Heating
She just wanna make the most of the weekend
Yeah the style I’m pitching
Conversation Alex Hitchens
Chiddy on a Wilder mission
This shit is fresh out the kitchen
Fuck the mornin' can I hit it on the stove top?
And I really don’t know why they know not
Yeah I’m a robot, never gonna let my go stop
If I never made it I would probably be on co-op
But since the night calls, I hit the green button
You think my old shit hard? You ain’t seen nothing
