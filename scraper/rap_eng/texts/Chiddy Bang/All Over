[Intro]
Yo Xaph, what that say?
I travel all over the place
All over the place
All over the place
I travel all over the place
Aight yo drop that shit, drop it

[Verse 1]
Aloha, bon voyage
Man I be out in Europe then my next stop, Prague
I be everywhere, tell her where you going with your swell ass
To northern Ireland, Chiddy could reign Belfast
Couldn't picture my life ever bein' turtle
Had a show in Wilmington, but we flew out of Myrtle
Yeah and this is my style, numbers that I dial
Know that time is limited I got a lot of sky miles
Hey, for where it's made to get worse
I was working double shifts like an agency nurse
And maybe at first, eggs this guy's overdone
And I hit the slope on them now my rise over run
If I spit that dope on them and my mind is a gun
And I'm waiting to blow, this is what you should know
If you ain't get the picture, understand that there is more to me
Got me throwing my arms around Paris shit, Morrissey

[Hook: Gordon Voidwell]
All over, all over
I'm throwing my arms around
Around Paris because
All over, all over
Only stone and steel accept my love
I will be back, accept my love
All over, all over
I'm throwing my arms around
Around Paris because
All over, all over
Only stone and steel accept my love
I will be back, accept my love

[Verse 2]
Different cities for these different days
It's a daze, lately I've been smoking on some different haze
Employers hate the day when you find something different pays
Remember rapping, my parents would tell me it's a phase
Yeah, well I'm sorry it's not
I'm calling the shots I gotta give it all that I got
Yeah, knowledge is power I can't wait to see my mind climb
And so does she, she can't wait to give me Einstein
But she can't call it a quickie
Peanut butter love I be gone in a jiffy
Yeah, see what else do we have but integrity
At which point do you become celebrity?
They want my signature, but I don't write legibly
Allegedly a Monster, can you feel the energy?
Even though I'm about to change latitudes
Never stress and I take it easy nigga with attitude

[Hook]
