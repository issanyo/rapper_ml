[Intro]
Fresh kid Z, fresh kid C (Yes, sir!)
Fresh kid P, fresh kid T (Oh yeah, we back!)
Oh, and Xaphoon, by the way (Yeah, Jones)
Yeah, Chiddy Bang
And we pretty much amazing
(Can we do the song, please?)
I got you...

[Chorus]
Ayo, I once was a kid, all I had was a dream
Mo money, mo problems, when I get it I'ma pile it up
Now I'm dope, Wonder Bread we can toast
So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us
Ayo, I once was a kid with the other little kids
Now I'm rippin' up shows and them fans going wild with us
Tell Mommy I'm sorry, this life is a party

[Verse 1]
Remember you was a kid, reminisce days of the innocence
Now it's Chiddy Bang, Google me the images
Follow me, follow me, I'm the leader
And when I park cars, I don't pay for the meter
I remember I was younger, as a kid it was the best
I used touch to on all the pretty girls at recess
I'm at my peak, yes, I won't leave yet
Serial style, cereal aisle, I need Chex
I can make these rappers run like a hard drill
Rock band show you how the guitar feel
And I could care less how y'all feel
I got the flow to make a bitch do a cartwheel
This is that good "Just puff it and relax, bro"
And you can get it free, don't worry about the tax though
And Xaphoon, thank you for the crack
But I play a Ron Burgundy, I anchor on the track like that

[Chorus]
Ayo, I once was a kid, all I had was a dream
Mo money, mo problems, when I get it I'ma pile it up
Now I'm dope, Wonder Bread we can toast
So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us
Ayo, I once was a kid with the other little kids
Now I'm rippin' up shows and them fans going wild with us
Tell Mommy I'm sorry, this life is a party, I'm never growin' up

[Verse 2]
Can I please get a little bit of knowledge?
Somebody tell Roth that I don't love college
'Cause the real world's kinda like Real World
And it's drama, so you are Svetlana
And I'm just a rhymer, swimming in the water
Trying to dodge the piranhas and fly to Bahamas
Pretty little momma, Chiddy in the spot
Where you at, pretty lady? Show me what you got
They say, "Why you rapping for the kids for?"
I said, "My clothes come fitted, the Lids store"
This summer you can catch me on a big tour
I'm high grade, I think they need to quiz more
And let me get wit ya, don't let the kid hit ya
I'm the photo album Voletta has, B.I.G. picture
The rule is, the dude is, so up, so chuck, I'm a cool kid

[Chorus]
Ayo, I once was a kid, all I had was a dream
Mo money, mo problems, when I get it I'ma pile it up
Now I'm dope, Wonder Bread we can toast
So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us
Ayo, I once was a kid with the other little kids
Now I'm rippin' up shows and them fans going wild with us
Tell Mommy I'm sorry, this life is a party, I'm never growin' up
Ayo, I once was a kid, all I had was a dream
Mo money, mo problems, when I get it I'ma pile it up
Now I'm dope, Wonder Bread we can toast
So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us
Ayo, I once was a kid with the other little kids
Now I'm rippin' up shows and them fans going wild with us
Tell Mommy I'm sorry, this life is a party, I'm never growin' up
