[Intro: Q-Tip] {​​​​Repeat 4x}​​​​
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go

[Verse 1: Chiddy]
Here we go
Them other rap dudes ain't near me though
This that shit for your stereo
Hit Louis Vuitton, yeah we go
Back atcha, spectacular
Flip shit 'round here, no spatula
The way they bite my shit like Dracula
And if the shorty fine, then I get back to her
And I love this game like Mario
But my flow is just like cardio
Intensive, offensive
And they ask why your belt expensive
They can't see me even if they had lenses
Top lonely, give a fuck about friendses
Cause I'm a lonely stoner, pop Corona
College dropout, no diploma

[Hook: Chiddy]
(Here we go) If you feel the heat in the kitchen
Or just washing dishes
Or dancin' for tuition
With the big dreams and wishes (Here we go)
Don't stop to listen
Just keep tryin' to get it
Cause you gon' get there
Put your hands in the air and say

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Here we go
Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Here we go, we go, we go-uh-oh-oh
Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Chiddy]
A Ha, A Ha
And I think I have the last laugh
And I'll pass class
Told them I was done with it
Opposite Of Adult, let's have fun with it
I'm a genius, and so is Xaphoon
Stay up, nocturnal shit, raccoon
Rap soon, holla at you later
They say we bout to blow up, Al-Qaeda
And this track was just a favor
That turned into a classic, hater
I run rap like a master dater
You take forever to make a procrastinator
Blind niggas can't see shit
And he a story of Victoria Secret
That's only if she keep it
Never mistake kindness for weakness

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Q-Tip]
A hater tried to stop me on my way, today
I got to get my ooh get out the way, my way, my way

[Outro: Q-Tip] {​​​​Repeat 3x}​​​​
Here we go
Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Here we go, we go, we go-uh-oh-oh
Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
