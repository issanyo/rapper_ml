[Verse 1]:
We gettin’ busy in the city
Lights look bright and the scenery is pretty
Tell Memphis I’m on my Grizzly, Bear
My mixtape droppin’ in two weeks
We get ‘em sent to us, you coppin’ them new sneaks
So exclusive, I used to think the game was so elusive
Now they feel me like masseuses, I author it, Dr. Seuss it
You win some, you lose, that’s the game for you
The truth hurts, all I did was ease the pain for you
And Chiddy, could you please give ‘em illness?
I’m on the couch, interviewing Dr. Phil shit
It’s the danger zone, I gotta hit the kill switch
On this Pursuit Of Happyness, I play Will Smith
Or Cudi, my MGMT, so good that Gabe Saporta is my buddy
And me on the pad is your doom
This is a big city, let the madness resume

[Hook]:
And we go on and on
We gon’ keep gettin’ til the gettin’ is gone
Cheah, yeah, here we go, here we go
And if you don’t know, now you know
And we go on and on
We goin’ keep gettin’ ’til the gettin’ is gone
Hey, here we go, here we go

(And if you don’t know, now you know)

Here we go, here we go, uh, yeah

[Verse 2]:
Uh, adiós to my haters
They tell me that you should always keep ‘em closer than neighbors
And video gamers, they tell me I got next
Paintin’ pictures like your sneakers, there’s nothing I can’t sketch
So colossal, and yeah I’m feeling like Picasso
I say we got that good nose candy for your nostrils
I’m about my Frito Lay
These rappers want to be Hov, they’ll be DOA
And we okay, healthy, but they say I have a sick grind
Prefer the money like my Mac player, QuickTime
Makin’ moves, can’t let the hatin’ scare me
You, on other hand, Hallmark stationary
What you runnin’ fam, you could never understand
I excel in your career and dance do the running man
And to the studio your girl could come
I am fresh off the bus, now I got a world to run

[Hook]
