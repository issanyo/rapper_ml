Ba ba ba ba ba
There is no-one like me (yeah)
Th-th-there is no-one like me, like me (Travie)
Ma-ma-manners, take a second look and you'll see
(Chiddy Bang, yeah we pretty much amazing)
There is no-one like me
There is no-one like me [?]
(No, yeah, [?] mind your manners)
([?], let's go)
Like me, there is no-one like

[Verse 1: Chiddy Bang]
And all the people should be raising they glasses
Flow crazy, celebrating the madness
I never thought I would deliver no classics
But now hooked up with them and I deliver more classics

Yeah, I be keeping it true
Motel good, as long as I can peep on the view
Like, like damn how high are we?
You gotta gamble in this life, Charles Barkley

I'm over-protected, through the dopest of methods
Now, like, over-perfected; this is audio breakfast
Yeah, so tell a hater here's a slammer
I know they hating on us but, mind your manners

[Hook]
Manners, take a second look and you'll see (you'll see)
There is no-one like me (like me)
Th-th-there is no-one like me, (like me), like me (la-la-la-la-like me)

Ma-ma-manners, you better re-consider (consider)
Because you will never do better (do better)
There is no-one like me (like me), like me (la-la-la-la-like me)

Ba ba ba ba ba (See, this is etiquette right here, you know what I'm saying?)
Ba ba ba ba ba ba (Mind your manners)
There is no-one like me (Mind your manners)
There is no-one like

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
Macho Man Travie Savage about to snap soon
Chiddy "Superfly" Snuka, Gorilla Xaphoon
Triple-lindy off the top rope, snap your clavicle
Eat the fucking turnbuckle like George the Animal

But no green tongues in here (no)
Ha ha, only green thumbs in here
So put the bubble push up in the air
Former fan who's no longer here

[?], rest in peace
I'mma hold you down until I'm dead; stinky, deceased (ugh)
I'm flagrant, I'm fagrant, I'm beast
(And Travie, what do you call a room full of rappers?)
A beast module

[Hook]
Manners, take a second look and you'll see (and you'll see)
There is no-one like me (like me)
Th-th-there is no-one like me (like me) like me (la-la-la-la-like me)

Ma-ma-manners, you better re-consider (consider)
Because you will never do better (do better)
There is no-one like me (like me) like me (la-la-la-la-like me)

Ba ba ba ba ba (See, this is etiquette right here, you know what I'm saying?)
Ba ba ba ba ba ba (Mind your manners)
There is no-one like me (uh, [?], mind your manners)
There is no-one like

[Verse 3: Chiddy Bang]
So say la la la (yeah), I arrived, voila
Black eyed I am, I surprise will.i
And I can't rely on another guy
I was caterpillared into a butterfly (like me)

I'm living in the moment, why won't you go and own it?
And we don't got the spirits, at least we could coron it
Order sake homie, I be sipping Ty Ku
And you get the wrong number if I don't like you

Say I'm the man, tell me why I gotta lie too?
Anybody, I'm the best; girl, let me advise you
Why? Because I'm feeling invincible
Junior High School, I had a crush on the principal

I guess I was turned on by the leadership
Now we got the game wrapped up on some pita shit
So tell a hater here's a slammer
I know they hating on us, but mind your manners

[Hook]
Manners, take a second look and you'll see (and you'll see)
There is no-one like me (like me)
Th-th-there is no-one like me (like me, la-la-la-la-like me)

Ma-ma-manners, you better reconsider (consider)
Because you will never do better (do better)
There is no-one like me (like me) like me (la-la-la-la like me)

Ba ba ba ba ba, there is no-one like me (Mind your manners!)
Th-th-there is no-one like me (Yeah, this is etiquette, bitches)
(Mind your manners) Ma-ma-manners, you better reconsider
Because you will never do better (mind your manners)
There is no-one like me (See, you could be searching the searcher)

(Just mind your manners) Manners, take a second look and you'll see [?], better
(Hello and exit) There is no-one like me (Mind your manners)
I'll wait
