We the realest tell 'em run it back
Problems - money come with that
I just ease the pain by chopping trees like a lumberjack
Thundercat, you ain't even ready for my summer raps
Coolin' on a minute I'm in to take the world, yeah I'm finna
It's young kidster, ain't nobody hotter than
Soon as I step in the building, shit she forgot her man
College ran to the point I had to leave, was not a fan
Maybe a little not my email get a lot of spam
I'ma wild out, basically
That means I probably don't care about what you say to me
I got a couple bad bitches, Lord, pray for me
Look in the mirror we the shit that they pray to be
And they pay to me
Roll the blunts make a mixed drink
And don't you dare say that I ever care what a bitch think
She ain't a single but for me she tryna lip sync
And once the lips link, now that's instinct

Yeah, and I ain't even on that other shit
We on Cloud 9, welcome to the mothership
Second verse is dedicated to bitches that's medicated
Off the pine tree, and she a dime piece
If I forgot you then make sure that you remind me
I'm only partying until I see my [?]
When I achieve, so is you down to get, listen
And livin', our lifestyle, they are so addictin'
I said they always be amazed how I rap fly
Hey yo, my eyes is currently upon your backside
Why? I stay gone off the loud purp
They gonna drop you if you ever try to crowd-surf
I'll touch a ball and say my style hurts
I get your number but I'm never gonna dial first
But I'm lovin' that
Go have fun with that
'Fore I jump out the window, I tell 'em "run it back"
