[Fela Kuti]
I am going to play for you our first tune tonight it s going to be about four tunes
And the first tune, here it goes
1, 2, 3

[Verse 1]
Now when them fights go down
Them lights go down
In villas and the village people might be round
They say that all the people gonna like me now
Because I talk about the issues in this life we found
All through the country people gettin' slain
Priority religion disobey, get hanged
I know some little kids quick to get militant
Just give them packs of the gun
They really feel the clips
They told me not to worry bout the struggle
And they don't gotta worry cause it's subtle
Tell 'em about the government takin' away the light
Aviation is ruined they say when you take a flight
Say when you take the continent from the white man threw
White man colonize wealth can't do
They fly G5 but they gotta land too
We explode like the landmines that they ran through

[Hook]
Oooooo, OOooooo OOooo OOOO
Oooooo, OOooooo OOooo OOOO

[Verse 2]
So we try palm trees in the sky
It's a beautiful day
I am just happy to be alive
I am playin' with slingshots with renewable goods
Think you got it tough because you're in the hood, negative
I am positive you would be in upset mode
When you wear the same thing like you got a dress code
I guess I am guilty of being privileged
Cause while I am in the booth my cousin is in the village
I seen a boy with no father
His mom ain't around, life's harder
Picked up soccer he tryin' to go farther
Hair is a mess can't find him no barber
And this is what its like
When you ain't got a life
I'm all they got left
But they trying to do right
And they feel my plight
They giving them insight
I know we gotta win
So then fly me a kite

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We get by, the weather is just right
Say good morning when I see you
Cause I gotta be polite
And I am livin' something different
Cause this can't be the life
You don't got a chance so you better focus on your plans
I try to grind like children that sell pure water
The land of the lawless muy slaughter
Negotiate your price I'll take your offer
In the market where they sell them what did that cost her
I try to chase the gold out here
But honestly its bumpy like the roads out here
And I advise if your salary is handsome
Vulu feli feli they will hold you for ransom
If you gotta take a glimpse of my family life
You will lose your mind Chris Brown on Grammy night
And this is what the news don't show
There is nothing on the plate so the dudes the dude's don't grow

[Hook]

[Chiddy Bang: Speaking]
Yeah, you see what this is man
We done came through all types of os
We still got people out there now
You know what I am saying
I am doing this for my cousin Remi
We gonna make it out the village some day
Sooner....later
