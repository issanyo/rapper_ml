[Hook]
And it's the same old thing
It's the same old thing, yeah
And it's the same old thing
It's the same old thing, yeah
And it's the same old thing
It's the same old thing, yeah
And it's the same old thing
It's the same old thing

[Verse 1]
I used to set in right, rest like
Chillin' where my room is
Tryna get high where the moon is
Flow dope like, "I don't know where the 'boon is"
But I don't know where the 'coon is
All I been was me, all I did was me
'Fore they saw my shit, I made history
Black sheep but a family, I'm the second boy
But I still went and broke again this record, boy
It feels good to wake up as yourself
When you don't care about anybody else
'Cause all you really need is food on the shelf
And all I really need is food on the shelf
Man, the hustle international
School of hard knocks, we did it with no sabbatical
And I was raised as a Catholic
But I can sing like a Baptist

[Hook]
And it's the same old thing
It's the same old thing, yeah
And it's the same old thing
It's the same old thing, yeah
And it's the same old thing
It's the same old thing, yeah
And it's the same old thing
It's the same old thing

[Bridge]
Motherfuckers wanna know what's going on with Chiddy
I been shuttin' shit down in your city
Show love, if you with me
'Cause it's not enough goin' around
Motherfuckers wanna know what's goin' on with Chiddy
I been shuttin' shit down in your city
Show love, if you with me
'Cause it's not enough goin' around

[Verse 2]
Didn't tour with Wiz, under the influence
And now it's under the influence
And they was all real
Tell my homie "pick me up at Hartsfield, Atlanta"
I got questions and God got answers
Like "how I end up in a room full of dancers?"
Like "how I end up spendin' all of my advance?"
Motherfuckers wanna know what's going on with Chiddy
I'm still trippin'
Matter fact, I'm Will Smithin'
Tryna label me as a backpack
With a snapback when I snap back, now my back pack's full of crack sack
Got a backpack but at least I got books in it
Yeah, I got raps but at least I got hooks in it
Baggage claim, it's the same old game
And now I'm hoppin' off the same old plane

[Hook]
And it's the same old thing
It's the same old thing, yeah
And it's the same old thing
It's the same old thing, yeah
And it's the same old thing
It's the same old thing, yeah
And it's the same old thing
It's the same old thing
