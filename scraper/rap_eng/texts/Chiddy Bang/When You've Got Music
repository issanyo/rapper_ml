[Verse 1]
Dear music I would like to say thank you
Cause I was down in the trenches and then you came through
I was thinking FAFSA, you chill me out and ill me out
Inspiration big picture you could capture
I could do that so I focus as if I just had a dosage
Dr. Dre Xxplosive so the people gotta notice
I double my kick game, I’m not new to stunts
I be taking harpoons, hope I don’t get new to blunts
So I chill, music said Chidera you have a deal
Now my shit is leaking everywhere just like the oil spill
Boy it’s real, I assure you that he’s urgent
Cause nothing in this lifetime is really ever certain
Freestyle middle school if only it was that simple
College yeah we made it, faded behind them black windows
Car drive full of smoke, yeah we blowing off steam
I spit the Paul Pierce, and never change teams

[Chorus (THE KNOCKS):]
When you’re feeling down and alone
You should be thinking back that you got music
Where you go
You should shake it back when the beat is alright
It’s alright

[VERSE 2:]
Yeah, I said musically, upper level that is where we soona be
Please take off your jewelry, that’s tomfoolery
Robinhood, my success is good for the community
Fell in love with samples from diplomatic immunity
And now I use the shit to eat, it's just a spoon to me
Funny how the shit could get different, it all humors me
Back in the day with no beats, I would have no room to spaz
Know how to budget the paper, now that’s consumer math
If they told them that I spit they would sooner laugh
Alexander McQueen, specials that Puma has
I never feel down, this game has its high points
Vibing in the studio, prerequisite five joints
Sonically they had to tell him I’m the hedgehog
It’s Mr. Everything-I-spit-will-make-your-head-nod
Hop back up on the track like let’s jog
And we be Rapping in Arenas, that’s the next blog

[Chorus (THE KNOCKS):]
When you’re feeling down and alone
You should be thinking back that you got music
Where you go
You should shake it back when the beat is alright
It’s alright
