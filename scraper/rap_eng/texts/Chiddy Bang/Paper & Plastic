Lettuce all on my bread
Paper all in my plastic

Lock it down, lock it down
And I got your mixes on handcuffs
But don't judge me, they like to love me
Come from the hood, I need a house up by the country
Yeah, that's tasty, and I'm bout to get a cake like pastry

But no wonder my heart stuck on AC, yeah

Late night, grip trashed, but the house crashed
Like it's pretty damaged
One me, 2 hers, do the match, Chiddy sandwich

Eating on a sandwich, all we need is some napkins
Please don't stop me in traffic, that's when business get drastic

What's happening, I'm a party captain
Eating on a sandwich, all we need is some napkins
Please don't stop me in traffic, that's when business get drastic
Lettuce all on my bread, finna get my paper and plastic
