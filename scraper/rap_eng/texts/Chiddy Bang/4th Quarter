[Intro]
Late night whippin' it
Late night whippin' it
Late night, late night, late night, late night

[Hook]
Late night whippin' it
We're magnificent
Music bumpin' loud I am not givin' in
Why? Cause I'mma pull it in the fourth quarter (Hey!)
Yeah, I go hard in the fourth quarter
Great life livin' it
Defense dribble it
I could say you have a chance, I would just be kiddin' then
Why? Cause I'mma pull it in the fourth quarter (Hey!)
Yeah, I go hard in the
Fourth quarter

[Verse 1]
Uh, call the swelly troops, this is victory
Remember junior high? They used to pick on me
Tell Gaga that I was born this way, became dope
And to the students, I used to be in the same boat
But when we start to pour get your rain coat
We gon' leave every motherfucker here drenched, soaked
And I'm a brainiac and this is swanky rap
Michael Sembello this Chiddy fellow's a maniac
Them haters try to locate whatever plane he's at
Droppin' anvils on him it's Animaniacs
Halftime superstar, fourth quarter legendary
They say that I was droppin' all mixtapes allegedly

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And this is just some fourth quarter antics
Who are you kidding? We be on some grown man shit
Text a chick cause I'm handsome, next we're spittin' at mansion
I bet you this, you ain't next to this
Cause my flow is like a light tantrum
And if you feelin' swelly, this is your anthem
Passport gettin' used up please stamp 'em
Said that shorty in the lobby a dancer
She down to get it? Yes is the obvious answer
I'mma spend this money, make it back
Gettin' first place in fact
Cause we give 'em dope, Xaphoon he could lace the tracks
Baggies is purple and yellow just like a Laker hat
You don't fuck with Chiddy I see you rockin' your hater hat
I finish strong, they don't call me no more
Be the star they adore if you go hard in the four
One time, let the game simmer
I fuck around and hit the game winner

[Hook]
