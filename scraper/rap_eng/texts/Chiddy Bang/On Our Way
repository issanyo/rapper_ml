[Verse 1]
Let the camera roll cause we on a holiday
This that feel good shit. Jackpot. Lottery
Holiday means that the water gets bluer
The kids get newer and the hating gets fewer
We on a holiday, this is what I gotta say
Them haters wish I would crack just like a pot of yay
My boy Zach introduced me to Star Wars
He had me thinkin' I was actually in Star Wars
Where's princess Leia?
I'mma Princess lay-er
Plus I get a lot of cake and in different layers
And different flavors is what we blowin' on
I'm so current with the styles so my flow is strong
And currently, I'm thinkin' 'bout the currency
And I'm chillin on a va-ca-tion
Shorty said she was Creole like a Haitian
Like parties with little kids, with the cake they come

[Hook]
Now if you want to roll with me
Little bit of grass right beside the palm tree
We'll be on our waaaayyyy
We'll be on our waaaayyyy

Just hit a little bit of this for me
Party 'till three, gotta be
We can go on a holidayyyy
On a holidayyyy

[Verse 2]
And this is like a holiday special
I hope you don't forget if you forgetful
Cause now we on the map so
The river runs, but they lack flow
I'm rocky like Colorado but on another plateau
You know I'm 'bout my grass like I'm farmin'
I'm the S.H.I.T boy, shout to South Harmon
I'm Mr. Tuned-in-with-Technology
So mami why don't you come sit on top of me?
She said she like the stars, here's the study
We can be the best friends, she can be my buddy
All about the Cudi, long as the shorty loves me
And like the professor, she like it's nutty
I like it cause I love it
The car costs her budget
I call it Pro Tools, so I always gotta dump it
And if you like Banana the we shoppin' at Republic
They do it but I does it
They like it, gotta love it (love it)
