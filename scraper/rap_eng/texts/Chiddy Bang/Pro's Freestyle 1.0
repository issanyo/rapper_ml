[Freestyle Verse: Chiddy bang]
Can I rock to this rhyme?
You're not on my mind
They said we blowin up
Don't jump on our mine
I once had a tie to the world, I was blind
Now I see everything through these contacts of mine
I'm at the office, yeah I does it again
I touch it wins, that's why the label buzzin me in
Uh, told my momma I won't stop til im signed
Im hot with the rhyme, you Megatron, I'm Optimus Prime
I'm locked in a line, I'm just waitin for my turn
Still fresh to death, so this paper I gotta earn
I am Stern, David comissioned me for athleticism
The prototype on the mic just check my mechanism
They ask, "How you make the world feel it?"
I say it's D-N-A, It's just in my double helix
My controversions sells, if controversy sells
Then I'm a take this 9, shoot the president and bail, uh
Not Barack though I love ya
You in a lower weight class, Im above ya
Can I get this? Guarantee I spit this
Hand on the stand, I guarantee you should witness yeah
The boy back like retro
I want my car to have NOS like Esco
I'm in that class in the corner I'm special
The flow magic, magic, presto
I take off, before it, I break off
Perfect attendance I'm never takin days off
And while I put in work they gettin a laid off
And this is based off, flow
I'm feeling like im near cash, on drive so I steer fast
Don't they feel my impact like a deer crash
Promised aunty if I win you see its right
Make the rain go away like a windshield wipe
I'm ripe, I'm raw, I'm everything above
A big enough heart to give a hater a hug
Shootin' off whether its grenades or a slug
Still bees honey bees designated by buzz, what?
