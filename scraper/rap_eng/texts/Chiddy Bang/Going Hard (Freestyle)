[Verse 1: Chiddy Bang]

They've been raw
I'm in my hotel on filet mignon
When Breakfast dropping I'm Lexus shopping
And once my album drops I'mma probably be necklace copping
Clean ass record but feel like the feds is watching
I'm a motherfucking bad boy Dennis Rodman
And I don't bleach my hair
My reach ain't fair
You're irrational but I'm international
And I'mma step my shit up until my status catapult
And your opinion doesn't matter you don't have a vote
But here's a big fat dick for haters to have a choke
Cause wrong or prone situations ugly like an ogre though
I'm just on my starship with these cobra flows
Big shout to my older bro
I was next Hov when Sean album dropped
Quiet as fuck but wishing that I could have his spot
Yeah guess we'll all sit back and watch
I don't just jump in the booth nigga I rabbit hop
An avid pot smoker so I'mma grind up every batch
I'm upfront with her instead of in the back
Let her see the seats
Watch her change her speech
Once she realize that it's wood
All my shit then will be good
Got the kind of shit to just excite her
911 tell her we can catch fire
It's nothing worse than a bitch fighter
It's nothing worse than a hitchhiker
And she in Team Swell but only if Chids like her
I'm a dog I'm a rotty
I'm Roddy I'mma Piper
Yeah steady going hard like that Ke$ha chick
Let's admit I be out in London shopping at Suffragettes
Longest rap I got the wildest title
Smoking out in France I thought I was on the Eiffel
I don't want your car that's a salvage title
Used to watch wrestling Vince was my idol
So tell them bitches pay per view
She would fuck a Laker too
But she like I love you Chiddy
I would fucking pay for you
Recess tell them hoes they should play for you
You gotta go but they all willing to stay for you
Fast life, flash life
Man ain't it true
Shout to Tiana, Biggie said it's what the game will do
I'm banging through never afflicted
I'm the future motherfuckers could never predict it
In the building motherfucker I'm never evicted
Team Swell captain forever enlisted
I'm out for my biscuits
Yeah, out for the biscuit
Throw a javelin, discus
Cumulonimbus
Be nimble
Be still
We will
Take over
Give the whole game a makeover
Telling whole chicks to stay over
Yeah I'm done
Team Swell ho
All's Swell that ends Swell
Saved by the Swell
