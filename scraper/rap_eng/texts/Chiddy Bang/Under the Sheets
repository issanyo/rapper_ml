[Ellie Goulding]
You left a blood stain on the floor
You set your sights on him
You left a hand print on the door
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before
This is our luck, baby, running out
Her clothes were never off
We still have hours to run about
To scale the map, scale the map, to get us back on track
I've seen you in a fight you lost, I've seen you in a fii-ii-ii-ii-ght
We're under the sheets and you're killing me
In our house made of paper, your words all over me
Were under the sheets and you're killin' me

[Chiddy Bang]
Xaphoon you crazy yo
It's that shit you can move to
Uh, yeah
I ain't worry about the critics
But why you tell your friends that I hit it then I quit it
I'm just laid back, don't think I'm a party guy
And if you look at me I bet I have you starry eyed
What kind of car I drive don't even know
Hard like UK shit 20 below
And Miss Gol-ding is explo-ding
I rebound Dennis Rodman with a nose ring
I get braino, hi hater no Maino
My name Chiddy and she know I'm going to bang though
Uh and that's word to the UK
I keep it kickin n pushing like I was Lupe
My definition is high, I think it is blue ray
And I still could care less what you say
Uh my last shorty she was down to ride
I killed her under the sheets it was homicide

[Ellie Golding]
We're under the sheets and you're killing me
In our house made of paper, your words all over me
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me
We're in a mess baby, were in a mess babe
Your more is less babe (oh, oh)
We're in a mess baby, were in a mess babe
Your more is less babe (oh, oh!)

[Chiddy Bang]
Let me tell you what was crazy though
I fell in love with a shorty up on the radio
And what did I call her a queen
Psychedelic shit got all kinds of green
Chiddy Bang spam we all on the scene
Used to be academic probation and deans
Now we sewing the machine, toast to the queen
Tell you how it is, no ghost, I intervene
I flow and get the cream take it apart
And everytime I try to fix it I be breakin' her heart
Then shit got worse when we made it to charts
Now it's different someone to tell them faces apart
Shorty don't leave me I make it so easy
She needs me but I ain't locked down like Weezy
I make her give me one on the cheek
And she ain't over me yet so I put her under the sheets

[Ellie Goulding]
We're under the sheets and you're killing me
In our house made of paper, your words all over me
We're under the sheets and you're
Oh you're killin me, your killin me

We're under the sheets and you're killing me
In our house made of paper, your words all over me
Were under the sheets and you're killin me
Killin me, killin me, killin me
Killin me, killin me, killin me
