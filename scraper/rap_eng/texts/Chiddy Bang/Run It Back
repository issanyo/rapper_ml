If this your favorite song - run it back
Everybody sing along - run it back
Stop playin' - run it back
Can't hear what you're sayin' - run it back

[Pre-Verse: Tim Saunders]
V.E.N.D
Virtual Entertainment Never Dies
Go

[Verse 1: Tim Saunders]
So this the shit that they been waiting on?
They all wondering why the mixtape been taking long
Well I was insecure about my flow a year ago
But now I'm arrogant as fuck, so nigga, here we go
Got a deadly flow, a verse will put you in a hearse
Hitting home runs, while these niggas still tryna get on first
Your whole discography can't even beat what I spit today
No Competition, Renegade, and this, that's a triple play
Put him in a hearse like Helmsley, Triple H
I already told you 'bout the hearse, nigga Triple A
Got your girl going down under, Triple J
Getting rid of all these niggas, triple k
They try to drag me down, I shake 'em off like a running back
When we take the game, I hope that these niggas don't want it back
I get standing ovations, nigga, a hundred claps
This song is nice, so make like Devin Hester, nigga, run it back

[Bridge: KiD TRAViS]
Yeah, and I'mma need you to do it
DJ run it back so the people move to it
Yeah, and I'mma need you to do it
DJ run it back so the crowd go stupid
Yeah, and I'mma need you to do it
DJ run it back so the people move to it
Yeah I'mma need you to do it
DJ run it back so the crowd go stupid

[Verse 2: Tim Saunders]
I'm back up in this bitch, like I'm Kirk Cousins
2016, we keeping the work buzzing
Cause in 2015, they said they ain't heard nothing
So a little effort and dedication won't hurt nothing
They be like "Run It Back was supposed to drop like half a year ago
Another lazy nigga wasting his talent, here we go
Nigga drop a fucking tape, man we have to hear your flow"
If V.E.N.D. drop in 2015, that's a fucking miracle
Well be careful what you wish for
Cause all my listeners are who I did this
I'm glad that all my rapping niggas set the bar so high
But I think that I can reach it, I'm like 6'4
But man, I'm not tryna get signed
I just went beast mode cause I'm not tryna get fined
And I'm almost out of here, I only got one more line
Jed, that hook is fucking fire, bring it back one more time
