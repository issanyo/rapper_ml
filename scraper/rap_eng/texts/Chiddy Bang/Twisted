Hook:
Yeah, yeah
Twisted, twisted, twisted
That’s what I do, do
Twisted, twisted I’m getting twisted
That’s what I do, do
Don’t get it twisted, twisted
That’s what I do, do
Don’t get it twisted, twisted
That’s what I do, do

Don’t get it twisted now
Here we go..and hear me flow
In UK I carry on
I switched up scenario
My momma told me education was the only route
Now I’m so jazzy, uncle Phil should probably throw me out
It’s what I do, don’t you know this is what I does
Sippin' on Courvoisier and Apple juice until I get a buzz
We’re about to pour it out I hope they’re ready for the brand new flood
And I think they’re stressed out
Yeah, they can use a few hugs
I’ve been.. for a couple of days
Haters will always be stuck in their way
Cause I’m up in the shade
Thinking of ways to make everyone part of my company pay
The love we have saved, what we have picked…
Yeah, everything that will get people amazed..
Yeah, look at where I am, uh!
Fuck these niggas, I know we’re ill!
Recognize this, they know we’re real
Three stacks in my jeans, no..
… I know how to go, we’re chill
It’s the.. feel, bitch, what I rap on
From the belly and the beast gets smacked on
And I do this all day, get lifted
We’re on a .. don’t get you twisted

Hook:
Twisted, twisted, twisted
That’s what I do, do
Twisted, twisted I’m getting twisted
That’s what I do, do
Don’t get it twisted, twisted
That’s what I do, do
Don’t get it twisted, twisted
That’s what I do, do

Hey, cheer!
And I’ll be candle lit, candle lit
Rip a show up in Los Angeles
Flip a beat that we sample it
Please don’t think that we planned for this
Yeah, I’m just lampin' it
Smoke some shit to examine it
Oh, you and us? not a problem, here’s your laminate
I lose it, she choose it for the beat up that I abuse it
And always stay on some bullshit
Late night, be riding, cruising
And I make some good music
On my bread shit, sigh high
..chilling in the grand room
What’s the pass for wi fi?
And I try to tell ‘em that they’re wrong for this, believe it
Once this drops they'll be back
But for now my dick is grieving
Used to be… that what my purpose was
And couldn’t pick a reason
I live this… life
I’ll be your host for this evening
What do I take … what you’re thinking is
..and I’m trying to get as much to…
And this is what you…
Practice, you should join the club
And I do this all day, get lifted
..don’t get you twisted

Hook:
Twisted, twisted, twisted
That’s what I do, do
Twisted, twisted I’m getting twisted
That’s what I do, do
Don’t get it twisted, twisted
That’s what I do, do
Don’t get it twisted, twisted
That’s what I do, do
