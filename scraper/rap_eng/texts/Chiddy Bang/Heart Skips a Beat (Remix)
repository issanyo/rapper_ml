[Intro: Olly Murs & Chiddy Bang]
My heart skips-skips-skips-skips-skips-skips a beat
Olly Murs, Chiddy Bang
Them girls make your heart skip like, like

[Verse 1: Olly Murs]
I can see, you're not yourself
Even when you're here, with me
I know that you're some, where else

[Pre-Chorus: Olly Murs]
So put another record on
Kiss and leave me on
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
Listen to the same sad song playing on repeat
'Cause every time we come this close, my heart skips, skips a beat

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this, you know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this, that's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Olly Murs]
So, hung up
We can't, let go
If you really have, to leave
One more time just move, me slow

[Pre-Chorus 2: Olly Murs]
So put another record on
Play it on repeat
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
Cause all you need to know, is what you do to me
And every time you hold me close, my heart skips, skips a beat

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this, you know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this, that's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 3: Chiddy Bang]
Hey, you make my heart skip a beat like
Hey lady let me take you out to eat like
Uh I’m fittin' to knock it out the park girl
So put your boyfriend on, three strikes
Outta here, greedy I don't gotta share
We gon’ be up til the morning we don't gotta care
I’ma sit back and play my cards like solitaire
You and your friends come with us, like we outta there
Olly Murs, Chiddy yea!

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this, you know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this, that's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro/Ad-Lib: Olly Murs]
Heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
My heart skips, skips a beat
