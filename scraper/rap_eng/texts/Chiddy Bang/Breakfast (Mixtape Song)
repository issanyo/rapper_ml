[Verse 1: Chiddy]
When the bass knock, the beat so hard
Got the 808 drum to make your face knot
Other rappers they chill, but we still flow ill
Got the shit to make you rock like Aesop
We gon' stay hot, that's forever and ever
Like to vacate where the weather is better
Flyer than a bird, we ain't on the same feather
Track number two: Never
We onto new things
This the type of jam to get loose with
And when they play us on the radio, "Who's this?"
Change the rules, throw away the rubric
And if you hatin' you can only be useless
Hell'a smoke when we be ride, straight Snoop shit
And I ain't never told a lie
See the truth is that we do this to the snare
Live from the home of the Prince of Bel-Air
Well, if you ain't got it then it's straight welfare
And you can tell we're
Above and beyond
Pro, James Bond
And this fly shit is a part of me
And don't I keep it flowing like a artery
Take cash, dreams never shatter
We ain't step it up
We just raised up the ladder
Gaze at us when we race past
Brand new Chiddy with the Ms. Kate Nash
Yeah

[Hook: Kate Nash]
Skeleton, you are my friend
But you are made of bone
And you have got no flesh and blood
Running through you to help protect the bone
Skeleton, we have been friends for years
And you have seen me through some trials
And tribulations and some tears
But everybody thinks I'm weird

[Verse 2: Chiddy]
Yeah, me too
Keep a bad chick right near me, too
Can you hear me, do
You understand
The words comin' out of my mouth
Swelly no doubt
Probably in a row by the exit
Reckless on a plane eating breakfast
Not a SAT, so don't test this
Your favorite rapper cool, but we be on some next shit
Calamari, I'm sorry we got the best food
I'm in the lab and the beat is like a test tube
From where it's hotter than a sauna
If you are arriving then you're probably a goner
Yeah they may ball, but they're probably Juwanna
And whenever I am off, then I'll probably be on her
I get to zonin and then I zone off
For this fly shit you gotta cut your phone off
Phone lost, high at the telegan
This is not a freestyle it's a skeleton
Skinny rapper in the room, I'm a elephant
Stay clear of all the birds and the pelicans
Shake the bass and then we take the place
All swell, Carvel, this takes the cake
F Jakes the snakes
Push him down the stairwell
And this is live from the pilot, Air Swell

[Outro: Kate Nash]
And I should have known
That it wouldn't be long until you
You've got me standing in an awkward position
