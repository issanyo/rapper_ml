(Chorus)
Sleeping through the day
Wake up with champagne roll me a (ay)
I told my mother I would quit
What can I say
I'm still breathing
Falling in love every evening
So we just gonna stay
Teenage dreamers born this way
I told my mother I'd grow up
What can I say
I'm still breathing
Falling in love every evening

(Verse 1)
Now I'm feeling young
I'm staying out late like its never been done
I'm using my heart like I got nothing to lose
Like I've been handed the keys to every door that I choose
We throw off our clothes and we jump in the pool
And every emotion is feeling like new
And we're on the posters and we're on the news
But we wouldn't care if they never knew
Our skin is burning we're up on the roof
We've been here for days and I can't find my shoes
I can't find my cell and I can't find my girl
And I wouldn't wanna be anywhere in the world

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
Now I'm feeling high
We're driving fast now like we'll never die
Pulling me close now her pupils are wide
And I see the future when I look in the sky
Its giving me goosebumps the permanent kind
Our bellies are warm now I think I can fly
We sit on the beach and she looks in my eyes
Tells me I'm crazy and I tell her she's right
I feel amazing we're pulling the blinds
Pouring the champagne and painting the night
Listening loud now to diamonds and pearls
And I wouldn't wanna be anywhere in the world

(Chorus)

[Refrain]
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
Open your eyes open wide
Watch the city come to life

(Chorus)
