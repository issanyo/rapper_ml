[Verse 1]
What up with you? I know you’re probably not used to this
And your ex-man always on some stupid shit
But she don’t care, check her attendance, she’s present
Seen her at night, I caught her at the crescent
Like get in the tub, this what I tell her when the time is right
I finally say what I’m supposed to when my mind is right
And soon I fly, and soon bye bye
She got that African pride, Kumbaya
Chiddy is a native and I put her on my latest
But she kinda tripping saying that we are related
And I can’t even call it, they say love is overrated
In the Jacuzzi til the sunrise, dumb high
Got a crib, got a spot, you could come by
Got the smoke that have you faded off of one try
She got them soft legs, she got them plump thighs
And her bathing suit is something that is fun-size

[Hook]
We got a jacuzzi
And we gon’ use it later
And yeah I got an Uzi
Oh wait it’s just my neighbor
And you don’t gotta worry
Just pass the rolling papers
I’m out of my mind
I be lost in the vapors
We got a jacuzzi
And we gon’ use it later
And yeah I got an Uzi
Oh wait it’s just my neighbor
And you don’t gotta worry
Just pass the rolling papers
I’m out of my mind
I be lost in the vapors

[Verse 2]
When the life is kinda hectic and sometimes it ain’t alright
So that’s why we stay chilling cause the water feels right
Take it to the hot tub, feelings start bubbling
I’mma need twice as much girls, that’s doubling
Cup is on half fill, faded had mad spills
She congratulate for the Guinness like boy you have skill
But these girls around here, they won’t get you far
They either far too kind or kinda from afar
That’s when you gotta screen them, hopefully somebody seen them
And if they ain’t top notch, why the hell you bring them?
But you are, cause you made it up here, upstairs
Now we kicking it in my Jacuzzi
And this a rollcall, thank you for this movie
You are just a supporter, a hater call you a groupie
Smoking til it’s dark out, things tend to pop out
She know I’mma give it to her, wait until we hop out (hop out)

[Hook]
We got a jacuzzi
And we gon’ use it later
And yeah I got an Uzi
Oh wait it’s just my neighbor
And you don’t gotta worry
Just pass the rolling papers
I’m out of my mind
I be lost in the vapors
We got a jacuzzi
And we gon’ use it later
And yeah I got an Uzi
Oh wait it’s just my neighbor
And you don’t gotta worry
Just pass the rolling papers
I’m out of my mind
I be lost in the vapors
