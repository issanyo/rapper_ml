[Chorus: Train]
I hope you know that I’m for real
My love is Super Size, ain’t no Happy Meal
But if I’m gonna stay (Got to wear a glove if we’re gonna make love)
I don’t wanna play
Baby roulette
Baby roulette

[Verse 1: Chiddy Bang]
Yeah uh, we used to get it into college
I ain’t learn shit, but got a lot of knowledge
The snow bunnies had the Ugg, boots with love swoops
You fall in love with them business majors that love suits
But shorties great right? This how we play live
Sent her a message like sign me in on the late night
I know there’s sharks in the water, but fuck a great white
My girl won’t know you said you go Penn State right?
We playing baby roulette
So I delete all the messages I ain’t savin' a text
Next, they can’t wait to hear a player confess
But shortie, you bullshit and remove that layer of dress
Yes, and this is that crazy shit
I think that it is that "I’m gonna have a baby" shit
But you're someone I cannot have a baby with
Just pass the blunt cause baby I ain’t gonna babysit

[Chorus: Train]
I hope you know that I’m for real
My love is Super Size, ain’t no Happy Meal
But if I’m gonna stay (Got to wear a glove if we’re gonna make love)
I don’t wanna play
Baby roulette (yeah it’s like)
Baby roulette

[Verse 2: Chiddy Bang]
Yeah uh, and maybe it’s the way I’m loving her lady lips
Part time waitress chick saving tips
And I’m still up on some Pretty Much Amazing shit
So roll a window up, baby we finna take this hit
We on the top floor, that’s what the game bring
My love is Super Sized, and I’mma let Train sing
And could we chill what we do is what you assume
Late night I just hit, but her roommate was in the room
Like damn, could we do this every weekend?
The baddest chicks on campus, I need them
And I don’t hate the women, so I’m prepared for love
But if we make it then of course I’m gonna wear a glove
I’m your savior, I’mma text you when I can
She falling for me, so I’m gonna catch her when I can
And when I call you we back on, loving you with the strap on
A bald head in the winter, I keeps my hat on

[Chorus: Train]
I hope you know that I’m for real
My love is Super Size, ain’t no Happy Meal
But if I’m gonna stay (Got to wear glove if we’re gonna make love)
I don’t wanna play
Baby roulette
Baby roulette
