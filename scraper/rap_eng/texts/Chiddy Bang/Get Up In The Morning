[Chiddy Bang]
Get up in the morning like don’t you feel the power?
Stand up and stretch together and by the hour
I devour a beat, now the rap game ours
Fresh and so clean be making raps in the shower
Yea, then I hit the boy Xaphoon
He tell me, “Pro, you don’t know I’m making mad tunes?”
And they wonder why we modest I assume, I remember we recorded in a closet for our room
Now I’m grinding, oh yea this is perfect timing
We machine, not hype, they figure we may be climbing
But like a punishment, gotta be grounded, I get up in New York my parents are so astounded
Get up in the morning, and then I hit up Ant, anything you can accomplish man she’ll never say “can’t”
And I got the drive, my 9-5, they kill your dreams but you gotta keep the grinds alive

[Hook: Desmond Dekker]
Get up in the morning, slaving for bread, sir
So that every mouth can be fed
Poor me, the Israelite
Get up in the morning, slaving for bread, sir
So that every mouth can be fed
Poor me, the Israelite

[VERSE 2: Chiddy Bang]
Yea, hey yo, I get up, after that I get it all lit up
Feel I got next might as well be playing pick up
When I get up in the morning, see my shortie might be calling
The Man on the Moon, got a buzz like Aldrin
Trust me those records so connected like the cable is
Check it the record, keep it Epic like the label is
They heard your beat in Germany, what can you do?
And when I’m getting up, that’s night time for you
Right I’m the glue, that mean I got that really sticky
Now we be bringing quarters back I got that really Vicky
She thinks she’s really with me, but she ain’t really with me
Ryan Howard with sour I got the Phillies with me
Never abandon him, old war tactics, bring a cannon in
Rap is at a stand still, mannequin
Cool on the floor, born a persona
If that is the kicks, trust me I’m preferably store owner
When I get up
