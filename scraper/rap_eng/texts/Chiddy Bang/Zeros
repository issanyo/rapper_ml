[Verse 1]
First of all, I could go hard with the worst of all
The best of all
Bitch better add a couple zeros whenever checks involved
I'm going to set it off, in this fuckin' house
You seen the information, you should know what we about
I swear, I'm the commercial
Don't try to change the channel, promise I'm a hurt you
Gotta broadcast, so we all got grass
Pretty girls with us and we all got ass
Xaph say you don't even got no pass
Chiddy slow down, you're going too fast
Going too fast? They say Chiddy, homie, you changed on me
I tell 'em naw I just came up without a stain on me
And now I'm walkin' like a pimp with a cane on me
And I don't even got a chain on me, ha!

[Pre-Hook]
Ridin' on 'em, vroom vroom
Hotel, take 'em back to the room, room
To the mats, an' the bass goes boom, boom
To the mats, the bass goes boom, boom

[Hook (x2)]
Not one, not two, not, not three zeros
Add a couple more, then we can talk some more
Funny how the dollar signs make you a hero
Hero, hero, add a couple zeros

[Verse 2]
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put my Pippen in it
Wingman, pimpin' in it
Into phat shit, I'm dippin in it
You heard the beat, now murder these
It did not occur to me
That when I hopped up on a track
That shit would need surgery
Certainly, if you gon' talk about math, it had better be large
Fresh shake up, bitch I'm Steve Harve
Mouth to mouth CPR, girl resuscitate it
I don't know how you got here but I'm glad you made it
And I'm Rasta faded, success is medicinal
And yeah I'm evil, so I'm chiefing next to this ya know?
Swell Check, uh, like I got physical
I'm on my toes when the moment gets pimpin though, Yeah
