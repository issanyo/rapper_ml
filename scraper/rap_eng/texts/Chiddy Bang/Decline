[Introduction]
PSA: Now arriving in Philadelphia, the last stop. Thank you for riding the Swelly Express
Chiddy: Damn, yo I just woke up son. That was the craziest dream ever dawg. Black Thought came through and gave us some advice and got on the track. Some Hollywood shit

[Verse 1]
They waitin’ for that decline
Pray that I lose my mind, they never want me to shine
But I observe that, trouble I will serve that
Ear to the streets, never will I give the curve back
Still movin’ at a velocity
Still sensing the animosity
Hate mail is what they send me
But I separate letters like an apostrophe
Colossally, didn’t come the same must of had two angles
He was isosceles, but now I’m Socrates
With philosophies
I’m in my tree house please don’t bother me
And now it’s lookin’ like hella smoke
Under age they lettin’ me pass the velvet rope
And this life getting reckless
Feeling like a lone star, Texas

[Hook]
Uh huh I know what’s on your mind
You don’t think were gonna shine
I face you to prove you wrong
Thought I was weak I tell you I am getting strong
This time its gonna be different than the last time
I swear I’m gonna turn this from a hobby and a pastime
Tomorrow gonna be better than today (yeah)
This will wash the pain away

[Verse 2]
Could you cheer for me when you see me?
Had to follow my dreams and they cannot believe me
But, you see I need it for the cake I go
Like Today on the TV and the radio
Retro ’80 flow, hood make it crazy though
Puttin’ work with music but the school made me lazy though
Why cause I couldn’t write enough rhymes
They say that hip-hop is dead we bring the vital signs
Never trippin’, I’m on a different grind
Bring slaughter to your houses, a young Nickel-Nine
See, now tell me would ya get me wrong
If I told you in the studio I met Solange?
If I said I command it like its the Pentagon
Hatin’ on even on the roof I’m upper echelon
But still forever we shine
Turn a negative to positive I never decline

[Hook]
