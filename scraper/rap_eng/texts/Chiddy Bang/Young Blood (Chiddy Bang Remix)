[Verse 1: The Naked and Famous]
We're only young and naive still
We require certain skills
The mood it changes like the winds
Hard to control when it begins

[Chorus: The Naked and Famous]
The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

[Verse 2: The Naked and Famous]
Can't Help myself but count the flaws
Claw my way out through these walls
One temporary escape
Feel it start to permeate

[Verse 3: Chiddy]
Yeah, I got this right here, I promise
Hey, I'm on top now
I fly a lot now
Though my parents used to have me up on lock down
First we paddled on canoes, We need yachts now
And we never gon' stop now
Tell them haters not now
This is my moment and you're not gonna ruin it
If you ever hated you're one of my influences
Like tell me how you're running it though
A year ago I was getting 500 a show
Things change, So do people, never say the flow is equal
Try to do good but only get stuck with evil
Big dog, they though I was some kind of poodle
That's when I said I heat em up like Ramen noodles
Ya in three minutes we winning
And we never scared of changes
So never are we timid
Told my mama I'm quitting, and she was so livid
She said baby you gotta keep killin'
And this is how I'm feelin'
Make it to the top, you doubt
LL cause my Momma said knock you out
I'm the top, you out
And the Henny is cold, man they shoulda never gave this to a 20 year old
They said the flow is universal like healthcare
You at the barbershop I'm killing shit elsewhere
I ain't had a hand out, no welfare
All I had was cable and Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire
We set up and go and greats way mirror
They hatin', Ray Ban, life's wayfarer
But people know you as Chiddy, your real name Chidera
The girls try to cover shit up mascara
Ya, and I've been focused since 08
Money make the world go round, let it rotate
I'm never focused on what one does
And lets toast for the Young Bloods

[Verse 4: The Naked and Famous]
We lie beneath the stars at night
Our hands gripping each other tight
You keep my secrets hope to die
Promises, swear them to the sky

[Chorus + Outro: The Naked and Famous]
The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Yeah, I love it)
(Can you whisper?)
The bittersweet between my teeth
(Can you whisper?)
Trying to find the in-betweens
(Can you whisper?)
Fall back in love eventually
(Can you whisper?)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
