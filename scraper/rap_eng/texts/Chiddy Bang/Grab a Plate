[Intro]
Uh, yeah, 2012
We here forever though
Go to places that they never go
I swear to God, man, they never show

[Verse 1]
Yeah, uh, yeah
Chiddy I was ?
Focused on the game it gets
A little stressed for her son was over-spontaneous
Focused on the change again, left school buttoned up
Fresh few, I bet I probably end up with the brain again
Superhero you could catch me in the radius
I'm Peter Parker and they Doctor Octavius
And could I get a bitch that's Armenian, Arabian
I'm goin' in nigga, man somebody call Damien
Cause his pops would be proud of what we just rolled up
That nigga Chiddy at your school? Man, hold up
And you wanna see me in a few girl?
Just send a DM and then I might show up
Chyeah, now that's swelly
Somebody pass the juice now I'm Makavelli
She tried to get my number to meet me up at the telly
I could give you my twitter, but I can't give you my celly
That's real rap, chyeah
And she just caught up in a loophole
Told her I should introduce her to the new soul
And if you let me, I promise never neglect ya
Know them niggas brought you down, but I'mma resurrect ya
As a matter of fact, we gon' do big things, what's the matter with that?
My cabbage is patched, grabbin' her back
She wanna smoke? You gotta match
Yeah, that's terrific
Should I be more specific?
And I be out in Cali in the west, that's Pacific
I got a couple bitches on that coast that I should visit
Yeah, uh, in my spare time
Just incorporated swell airlines
So we don't worry 'bout losses, so take a L, here
Fuck it I'm the fresh prince of swell air
And life's a process, I'm just going through step one
Poppa wasn't a rolling stone, my nigga I met one
Of course it's him, jumped up in the water we were forced to swim
Now I'm strokin' 'em all, breakfast orderin'
We're more than friends, a quarter, spend a hundred then we high
As we want it, I woke up this morning and got fly as I wanted
Oh, the power of choice, uh
It get's paid by the hour, my voice
That's when we, that's when we book up
Witness that's when we cook up
Holla at me if ya hear me, yeah I got the hook up
Team Swell, if you don't know us you should look up
I got a jumping jack, but I prefer my kush ups
And it's looking up, we out to space
Hear your wack flows and that shit is out of date
I swear this year we got a lot, boy, without a say
Don't worry mama, I'm gon' show you how that Prada tastes
We out of state, we gotta pay
Situations we gotta make the best of it
So at the end, it's Breakfast, grab a plate

[Outro]
(Grab a plate, grab a plate, grab a plate, grab a plate)
Dr. Dog, man, Philly
Xaphoon Jones, man
I'm so stupid
Yeah
