[Verse 1: Chiddy Bang]
Summer mornings, we be smokin' in the sunshine
Done trying shit, we got it done one time
'Cause if they pull us over, then they'll smell the scent
And I'm straight, but the kush got me hella bent
This type of practice is most effective when under tense
Around the atlas, they do it and I am so convinced
That you can never find it cheaper than what they have charged
Got the medical on deck, I play my cards
Yeah, I met her in the tenth grade
And when I hit her, she take me back to the old days
Coming up we was the opposite of so paid
Wanted the Jordans, we blunted, we had no J's
And I got us all so you should know we all we got
Started from Starbucks, now we at the coffee shop
And this reflecting is the feeling I'm accepting
So the money I'm investing, hope the boys aren't arresting

[Hook: eLDee The Don]
Sitting back as the days go
You know we make pay roll
Yea, we get high as the ceiling
Can't fight the feeling
You see I got a couple issues, I got a couple Issues
I can't leave my smoke
We get high as the ceiling
Can't fight the feeling

[Verse 2: Chiddy Bang]
Yeah we can't be all-stars
Life hits you man that shit can catch you off-guard
Take an L ride, there's a lot of benefits
But when you smoking in the car, you start to reminisce
One day you moving in, freshman year, conversatin'
The next moment you a senior and you're graduatin'
I was in college then I found my super powers
And I smoked a bit of sour, class is over in an hour
Like why the semester ain't over yet?
And they some young bulls, tell me why they ain't older yet?
And if they said we wasn't faded better doubt it all
Frat parties with the alcohol
So give me Coca-Cola. A hater tell them hola
Yeah I'm a money holder, and ain't nobody colder
Fuck it, I be a star, I'm on my supernova
I can't fight the feeling, we smoke until it's over

[Hook: eLDee The Don]
Sitting back as the days go
You know we make pay roll
Yeah, we get high as the ceiling
Can't fight the feeling
Say I got a couple issues, I got a couple issues
I can't leave my smoke
We get high as the ceiling
Can't fight the feeling
