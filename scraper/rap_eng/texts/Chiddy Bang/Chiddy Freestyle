Can I rock to this rhyme?
You're not on my mind
They say we blowing up
Don't jump on a mine

I once had a time
To the world I was blind
Now I see everything
Through these contacts of mine

I'm at the office yeah
I does it again
I touch it, it wins
That why the label buzzin' me in, uh

Tell my momma I won't stop 'til I'm signed
I'm hot with the ryme
You Megatron, I'm Optimus Prime

I'm locked in a line
I'm just waiting for my turn
Still fresh as def'
So this paper I gotta earn

I ain't Stern
David commision me for athleticism
The prototype on the mic
Just check my mechanism

And they ask how you make the world feel it?
I say it's DNA, It's just in my double helix

Controversey sells
Controversey sells

And I'mma take this line
To the Presidential hill

Not Barack, though I love ya
You in a lower weight class
I'm above ya

Can I get this?
Guarantee I spit this
Hand on the stand
I guarantee you should witness, yeah

The boy back like retro
I want my car to have NOS like Esco
I'm in a class, in the corner
I'm special

The flow's magic, magic, presto
I take off before, and I break off
Perfect attendance
I'm never taking days off

And while I put in work
And they getting a lay off
And this is based off

Flow

I'm feelin like I'm near cash
On drive, so I steer fast
Don't they feel my impact like a deer crash?

Promise I tear
If I wait, you see it's frontin'
Make the rain go away
Like a windshield wipe

I'm right, I'm wrong

A big enough heart
To give a hater a hug

Shooting off
Whether it's grenades or a slug
Still bees, honey bees, designated by bugs

What?
