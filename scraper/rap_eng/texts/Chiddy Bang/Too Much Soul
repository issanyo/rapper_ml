[INTRO]
Too much soul for the world
Too much soul for the world
(Yeah, how my voice sound)

[Verse 1]
We been through everything and more, somehow still we made it merry
When everybody that play hot and cold Katy Perry
They criticize you because history they can't make
And I gotta notice something that's fake about these handshakes
I'm to cold, flo to bold we bring you that new soul
Music, I got that brand new chicken noodle for your soup bowl
Lanky like Manute Bol, faded I stole Snoop's bowl
I'm here I found a loophole, I can track you search for fools gold

[Hook]
Look out!
Cause I'm just too fake for the world
I know it's just a game to me
I'm just too fake you see
I wish I didn't have to be but watch out
I got too much soul for the world
It's breaking my heart in two
I got too much soul for you
I don't like it but it's true

[Verse 2]
From class clown to class king now we all to laugh
They say now you've gone superstar can I have your autograph
And then I say yes, they too fake but I can't be stressed
Say the way I do it so easy as, can I tell them where to go no GPS
And I'm still near it though, the top I cannot fear it though
Gotta grapple with that fact the most, cause people didn't give a fuck a year ago
My life is pretty as the face of a girl, and watch out I've got too much soul for the world
