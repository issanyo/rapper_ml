What I look like out here runnin these streets with no heat
What I look like swoopin the Coupe with no beat
What I look like flossin a 6 with no dubs
Same way I would tossin these tricks with no gloves

What I look like bangin some shit that you can't feel
What I look like hangin with niggas that ain't real
What I look like kickin it with bustaz
Same way I would picketin some shit, tryin to get justice

What I look like bein scared to ride on this beast
What I look like throwin up Westside when it's East
What I look like wearin my khakis with no crease
Same way I would carin bout crackers or police (not)

What the fuck I look like trickin, simpin and lickin
When I got my pick of so much chicken it's sickenin?
So what I look like be flirtin with white chicks for sex
Same way I would wearin rockin t-shirts without tight necks

No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY!
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY!

No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY!
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY!

What I look like - all up under a man
With no dreams of my own, eatin out of his hands
What I look like - fuckin niggas for things
It's the tricks that pay for the AHH
Queens don't put out for the BLING

What I look like - changin two words
For the overseers of the upperclass and suburbs
What I look like - cryin for those
Not really down for the cause, they just wear links and a pose

What I look like - not shinin when I flow
Not makin heads turn like - who you boo?
And what I look like - not claimin the West (what?)
A true tried representative, guaranteed to bless

What I look like - sacrificin the light
Cause I let a nigga slide through and I wasn't his wife
What you look like - not speakin the truth
That's how you end up in a alley with your brains loose

No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY!
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY!

No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY!
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY!

Man what I look like slavin for a cavi
What I look like joinin some motherfuckin army or navy
What I look like not tryin to even the odds
Same way I would believin in some mystery God

What I look like lettin niggas play me
What I look like not sweatin motherfuckers to pay me
What I look like frightened, feelin I ain't equal
Same way I would fightin and killin my own people

What I look like sellin my soul for this world life
What I look like without a cold black pearl wife
And what I look like beatin mine
Same way I would smokin cigarettes, drinkin and eatin swine

Now what I look like breakin my covenant
What I look like, not takin a stand against this government
And what you look like livin like a bum
Still blind deaf and dumb in two thousand and one

No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY!
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY!

No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY!
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY
No shit - you know - no shit - OKAY!
