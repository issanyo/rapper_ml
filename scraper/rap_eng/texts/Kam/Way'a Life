[Chorus 2x]
It’s just a way’a life
It’s just a way’a life
It’s just a way, just a way, just a way

[Verse 1]
I’m out on the prowl livin’ foul
Used to be a saint but now that ain’t my style, I’m buckwild
Ain’t no turnin’ back, ‘cause I’m in it too deep
Comin’ closer to a jack every minute you sleep
I keep straps on deck the Wild West mounties
Black ski mask and a fresh pair of brownies
Smokin’ fluid, I knew it would make me bust
Call it loop, call it sherm, call it (angel dust)
Just a few hits and I’m on some new shit
Spinnin’ this beginnin’ and get my whole crew blitzed
So if the shoe fits, wear it
Sorry, but I’m taxin’ any hoe wit’ a 24-karat
Like a parrot you was mockin’ me, ‘cause I was younger
Now that’s what you get for writin’ down a bunk number
Never once did I wonder was she somebody’s wife
‘Cause livin’ in these streets, crime is a way’a life

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It’s another long night in the cold
I’m livin’ on the streets, servin’ heat, watchin’ drama unfold
Call it home sweet home, but how far will you get
When this is the only place you familiar wit’
It’s hell on earth, from the birth to the death
Cocaine on the brain, alcohol on the breath
Ain’t a damn thing for you to look forward to
(So beam me up, Scotty)
Ain’t nobody but the Lord wit' you
I take it one day at a time, tryna stay sane
Trippin’ ‘cause I keep slippin’ back down memory lane
I feel the pain but at least I’m alive
100 percent hustler, ain’t fuckin’ wit’ a nine-to-five
Determined to make a name for myself
Three strikes and you out? Well, I’m up to my twelfth
I know that wealth ain’t greatness
‘Cause most rich people helped to create this way’a life

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So ain’t no peace and quiet, fuck silence
I’m raised on junk food, sex and violence
Just a product of a corrupt environment
Where black men cry and went (early retirement)
Gunfire sent niggas to an early grave
And layin’ good never could make a girl behave
You could save all that, throwin’ me a macho pitch
I’mma tell you like she did (I’m not yo’ bitch)
Switch places, now female sexism got niggas askin’ who ain’t cashin’ checks
Is I’m just too literate? Considerate it payback
If you ain’t Pat then it’s best to not say jack
Because they act now how niggas acted then
Look where time took us if hookers mack to men
And kids do life bids, servin’ all day, but hey
That’s the American way
A way’a life

[Chorus]
