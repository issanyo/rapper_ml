Damn, one-time just bust a u
And they 4 deep, too
They seen all these caps and t-shirts
And them gold thangs underneath the skirts
But the law ain't been broken
Wait, I see 3 white cops and one token
Oh, so that explains it, no doubt
Uncle Tom pointed us out
But I ain't tryin to get jacked
They give me static, I'm givin the shit back
Cause I ain't did nothin wrong
And this L.A. drama been goin on too long
So it's on if they touch me
Matter of fact, they better Starsky-and-Hutch me
Cause fool, I ain't waitin
I'm 5000, so much for gold daytons
I hit a side street and circled twice
Shook em like hot dice
Parked the toy in a driveway
Cause the same thing happened last Friday
I tried to tell you, they was devils once befo'
But y'all don't hear me though

(Hey fellas
You guys know who I'm talkin to)

(Damn, this baby pagin me, 911)
Who is that? (This bad-ass white girl from...)
Aw nigga, you went out like a straight boyscout
(What you talkin bout? fool, this girl a straight freak)
Yeah, she probably have your ass at the clinic every week
Askin the doctor, "Have you ever seen this?"
With a long-wired q-tip stuck up your penis
Waitin for the test results to come back from upstairs
While you say your prayers
And ask yourself: was it really worth it?
Before Casanova crossed over, everything was perfect
But you wasn't satisfied with the sisters
So now you got blisters
Trick or treat? (Aw nigga, you can eat a dick)
Or vice versa, that's how you treat a trick
Nigga like you who ain't learned
That hittin pale skins'll get you burned
Man, y'all better let them white hoes go
But y'all don't hear me though

(Hey fellas
You guys know who I'm talkin to)

(Damn Kam, I got a migraine) What you eat?
(Just some pork chops and pig's feet
And a couple of strips of bacon)
What? (And my head just started achin)
I hate to say 'I told you so', but I told ya
You couldn't take it from a soldier
Kam got the ham broken down to a science
So keep it out your appliance
Cat plus rat plus dog equals hog
Poison-ass animals, people need to ban em all
(Nigga, I been eatin pork all my life, and I'm cool)
Fool (You don't know what you're missin)
Listen that's the reason why you get sick so quick
And spend a straight grip with doctor Tom Slick
So he can fill your prescription
For your ass, for your headaches, and your hyper tension
When all you gotta do is stop eatin the swine
And everything'll be fine
Black folk better leave that pork at the sto'
But y'all don't hear me though

(Hey fellas
You guys know who I'm talkin to)

Damn, my nigga got stretched
He's down for the K.O
For movin that yayo
And now they askin him to snitch
I hate to say it, but the nigga dug his own ditch
So now he's caught in a catch 22
Damned if he don't, and fucked if he do
Lookin at 15 with a l
Scared he'll touch down, so what the hell
He starts singin like a bird
Federal detectives recordin every word
Puttin niggas in a twist, steppin on toes
How long will he last? God only knows
Ballin outta control got him put in the hole
So it's on like that, nigga? Where my niggas at?
It ain't like he didn't know
Cause I damn sure told him
He just ain't hear me though
