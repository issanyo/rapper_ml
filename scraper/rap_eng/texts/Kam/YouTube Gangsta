[Verse 1: King Lil G]
I Had A Conversation With God
I'm Trying To See Through My Future
Why They Killed My Homie Shaggy?
Why They Had To Go Shoot Em?
Why We Grew Up So Broke?
Why Is My family Ruined?
Why These Fake Ass Rappers
They All Be Acting Like Judah's
Please Explain To Me
Just Explain To Me
On Why The Fuck You Smiling Front
But Then show Jealousy
This Bout To Kill Ya
Dropped Another Video
But Nobody Feels Ya
And I Don't Care
What You Be Rapping About
I'm Not Familiar
I Dropped A Video
In 90 Days It Got A Million
My Fans Promoted That Shit
I Bet It Fucking Kills Ya
The Can't Wait To Get In Fights
So They Can Go Record
The Only People Who Record
Is A Fucking Informant
You Saying That's The Way You Get Exposed
But How You Get Exposed
When All You Did Was Let The Cops Know
For All That Shit You Putting Up
And Thanks To You
Now Detectives Got A Lead
Now They Know Whats Up

[Hook: King Lil G]
YouTUbe Gangstas

If You Too Gangsta
I Know You Thirsty For Fame Boy
I See You Thirsty For Fame Boy
YouTUbe Gangstas

Why The Fuck You On The Internet
If You Too Gangsta
I See You Thirsty For Fame Boy

[Verse 2: KAM]
Lord Have Mercy
It's So Many Satan's
Thirsting For Fame
And Even More People Who Hatin'
Speaking Curses On My Name
Instigatin' Behind The Curtain
While I'm Just Peepin' They Game
Trying To Act Like They Ain't Hurtin'
But These Lames Is All The Same
One Thing I Know For Certain
That's The Burden & The Pain
Staying Real While Others Feel
No Need To Live By What They Claim
Such A Low Down Dirty Shame
That That's Your Purpose In Your Aim
Too Many Cannibals
And Circus Animals
For Me To Tame
I Could Either Go Postal
Or They Could Read You Your Rights
We Gangsta West Coastin'
You Social Media Sites
About The Lights & The Cameras
When You Go Into Action
You Like A Nail With No Hammers
Can't Get No Satisfaction
While I'm Relaxing With The Fam
Proving I'm More Than Just A Rap Cat
You Busy YouTubin'
On Instagram & Snapchat
Getting Laughed At
Dude We All Come From The Fucking Gutter
But Thanks To That I'm Coming Up
But You Ain't Nothin' But A..
