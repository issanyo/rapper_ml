[Verse 1: Kam]
Hittin' corners in a six-trey Chevrolet
Rag-top Impala, top dollar
Got my cousin Laid-Back ridin' shotgun
'Cause I got the front-and-back hydraulic hot one
Juiced up, and I'm itchin' to hit the switches
Crawlin' over train tracks, avoidin' all ditches
Ice-skatin' on the 20-inch tires
Jacked up the ass, and flex the gold Dayton wires
Now I'm down to take a risk
Gettin' geeked up off a compact disc
I went hoppin' up Crenshaw, niggas hang loose
Lookin' for my homies to celebrate the gang truce
And they about to throw a cook-out
So I'm puttin' down the hump, we sailin' on the look-out
For C.H.P., I was a teenage 'G'
So I'm readin' the graffiti
The walls say "Peace treaty"

[Verse 2: Kam]
Lookin' at the aftermath of the riot
I can still smell the ashes
From all the clashes
But quiet is kept, it wasn't just the blacks
Everybody was lootin', and had each other's backs
We came through in understandin', demandin'
Justice, bust this, we all had our hand in
The cookie jar, took it far enough to make a statement
Daryl Gates - that's where all the hate went
We pass by a swap meet
Been shoppin' at for years, but it couldn't stop heat
See ya, wouldn't wanna be your next door neighbor
Less government relief checks, more labor
10 percent blood suckers of the poor took a loss
For exploitation, had to show 'em who was boss
Teach 'em not to be so greedy
Had to shut them down, bound by a peace treaty
Bound by a peace treaty

[Verse 3: Kam]
Hit the park, bailed out the car
And seen blue and red everywhere, look how strong we are
Niggas showin' up from this gang and that gang
Nobody set-trippin', 'cause it's a black thang
People just partyin', sippin' on a cup
Some of the Compton F.O.I. even showed up
Suited and booted, kickin' it with the locs
In unity, soon we'll be lovin' all black folks
I heard Solo, bumpin' in a Blazer
Clownin' on a car phone, blowin' up my pager
Watts-Up is on the set
Just checkin' out the scenery, brothers I ain't never met
Is hittin' me up, I had to swallow my pride
Just kept steppin', hit 'em up and said, "Right"
Ain't no drama, 'cause I'm mobbin' with Laid-Back
I seen Big Jess, Jay and K-Mac
They used to work them narcotics
Like my nigga L-Wood and Renegade from the street products
We used to jack from the rich, and then give to the needy
But now it's a peace treaty

[Verse 4: Kam]
And now the party's acceleratin'
The whole crowd bounce, and sho' nuff celebratin'
Ain't nobody bustin' shots
I bumped into Mike AKA Mo' Like Watts
An O.G., 'cause he's older
Lovin' every minute of it, with the camcorder on his shoulder
So he could capture the moment, and reminisce
I'mma always remember this
Because my niggas made the history books
And now the mystery looks
A lot clearer
The man in the mirror got power
It's now or
Never, more than ever
Black people have to stick together
But yo, let's hear it for the Bloods and the Crips
I gots to admit it, y'all brothers did it
I just hope it don't cease
For the sake of all the homies that's restin' in peace
