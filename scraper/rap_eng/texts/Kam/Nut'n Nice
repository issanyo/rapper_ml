[Chorus 4x]
(Snoop: I’m not flaggin’ but I’m just saggin’)
(Left Eye: If it's saggin’)

[Verse 1]
Come on down, you the next contestant on 'The Dice is Hot’
Nice, it’s not
First item up for bids is kids in the projects
Actual retail price (Nigga, four chin checks)
Index fingers get exercise
I’m lookin’ for a lick, so who’s next to rise?
I’m starvin’, and since the hunger won’t go away
I’m spittin’ out slugs with a deuce-five throwaway
Lick after lick, vic after vic
And then I’m off to get my duck sick trick after trick (uh)
It’s time for the showcase showdown
And I’m the kinda nigga that’ll straight kick your door down
But yay as I walk through the valley
Or better yet the alley of death, I hold my breath
‘Cause I’m followed by shadows, from previous battles
And a nigga’s lifestyle ain’t nut’n nice

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Step up to the wheel and take a spin
But no matter where it stops, the game is a no-win
I’m tryna get closest to the dollar without going overboard
Here comes an over-
Lord Knows I don’t need another case
So it’s down to a foot race, tie my shoelace
And hit the fence like Kurt Thomas
Yeah, it’s on for today ‘cause tomorrow ain’t promised
I’m goin’ out the B.G. way
I can’t get stuck with no GTA
I play hide and go seek, ‘cause one-time, they blind
But who woulda thought they’d brought the K-9
Unit, and soon it’ll be all be solved
Grandparents don’t like to get involved
‘Cause I done already been to camp twice
But I hear the county jail ain’t nut’n nice

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So this begins my showcase
And I’mma about to trip but I ain’t goin’ no place
Damn this vacation
I shoulda listened to the minister and got with the Nation
Instead, I feel like a fool
‘Cause now I’m on my way to gladiator school
Yeah, but y’all can kiss my wild ass
Nah, I can’t fade this showcase, sir, I pass
But the next one begins with a 1-87
I was better off with the 2-11
Now I’m a felon, and ain’t no tellin’
Like Jack told Helen, how long I’d be bailin’
On the courtyard, because here, life is short and hard
(Trust no snitch) I’m always on guard
I did the crime, with time, I’m payin’ the price
And this shit ain’t nut’n nice

[Chorus]
