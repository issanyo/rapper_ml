[Verse 1 - Bobo Phantom]
My mic is hotter than a crack pipe, I'm attacking the whack types
The mad types, the click-clack hit a nigga in his back types
I slash wind pipes with a fast swipe
Turn around, see the homies, blast the mac twice
One hits the floor, the other hits the pavement
One gets up, the other one stays dead
Dodgin' sprayed clips like the matrix
Gettin' impatient jumpin' fences for payment
Take the mask off, they shoutin' "it's the phantom" in tandem
Turned around popped a magnum
Left the nigga temple leakin' with a chasm
He ain't so handsome now, blast another cap just skimmed his brow
I ran up and planted my fist in his rib-cage
Ripped out his heart and ate it up like a rib steak
Took the cupcake's whip plates, and dumped his body off the bridge late
Then fucked his wifey in her dump gate

[Hook - Bobo Phantom] x 2
Mind over matter, mind over matter
Quick to bust a nigga then watch his blood splatter
Fuck with me, I'll make your skull shatter
Mind over matter, mind over matter

[Verse 2 - Bobo Phantom]
Best believe I been a fiend for the cream
I spit sixteens on the scene with presidential decree
Without missing a beat, i beat niggas to the concrete
Lift them off they feet and smoke them out like pork meat
Cause niggas on some hammy shit
Cali to Miami shit
Dropped a mixtape
Now they plottin' on some Grammy shit
Quick to leave niggas neckless for a necklace
Reckless, when i grab the mic i rip it and wreck it
Leave niggas defenseless, then i swoop in and leave them breathless
I can't stress this, like asbestos i'm infectious
I stay ruthless, been real since i was toothless
And know i don't give two shits about your fuckin' huge clique

I'll still beat your ass and stab your mama with a toothpick
You're useless

(Hook x 2)
