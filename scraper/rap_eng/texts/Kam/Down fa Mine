[Verse 1: Kam]
Well, it's the 1 to the 9 with the 9 to the 4
And I thought you knew the drill but you still don't hear me tho
KAM and Watts Up from the grassroots
No Daisy Dukes shit, knockin crazy-ass boots
Nigga please, we kick it like G's
Puttin down work when I lurk, don't even sneeze (up the gold D's)
That's just the Eastside way of gettin chips
When you're raised up dealin with the Dogs and the 'rips
New cars get tagged, riders get wrecked
Niggas' caps get peeled back and chins get checked
Don't expect no love or no apology
The kids ain't fallin for your child psychology
In 9 and 4 mindin yo business was the best bet
Screamin 'Watts Riot', we ain't even made a mess yet
You shouldn't speak with a weak heart
You gots to finish everything you start
That's why I'm down for mine

[ Hook ]
(Get down for yours
I'm down for mine)

"Hit the park, bailed out the car"
"To get away from the A.K. spray in the broad day"
"South Central, the ill mental"
"Just kept steppin, hit em up and said right"

[ VERSE 2: MC Ren ]
Well, it's the Mad Scientist with my nigga Kam
Niggas be knowin the way I be doin it, fuckin up the jam
The size ten steel toe steppin, nigga, keep my shit simple
Hangin with my niggas on Caldwell and Temple
Niggas out fakin like they got skills
Rollin 'round with they rats in they floss mobiles
With their caviar dreams and champagne wishes
Niggas run they mouth like some muthafuckin bitches
Niggas be plottin like the government
But I'm low-key like a Mason, so they still chasin
The nigga that they thought was the Villain, that's wrong
Different individual and different fuckin song
I carry a big stick, burnin is the heater
Niggas too in love with the German millimeter
So I fuck it up when I bust my rhyme
'Cause Ren down for mine, a nigga down for mine

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 3: KAM ]
Well, I once had this homeboy who loved to jack
We used to serve herb for a dub a sack
In fact, back in the day, when you could slang yay
Couldn't nobody tell me that crime didn't pay
It was on and poppin with the Bloods and Crips
Every neighborhood tryin to regulate they chips
Niggas goin out of town with the greasy chickens
And if you wasn't down, you was easy pickins
You had to claim a set to get supported then
So every day new niggas got courted in
For some gangbangin was a full time job
Cookin up dope like corn on the cob
Had to mob deep when you bailed into a party
Daytons on the MC with the wood knotty
Flag in your back pocket, deuce-five in the front
Rollin bats with the zig-zags 'fore we knew about the blunts
But no matter who jocks us
I got my sag on 'til you saw the tag on my boxers
Cause the I-don't-give-a-fuck mentality'll raise niggas off yo line
So I'm down for mine

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 4: Dresta ]
Let me take a second to do some mic-checkin
Bet I got a head flexin in every section
Everybody know me, D-R-E the O.G
"Compton City G." on TV with Eazy
But now I'm all on my own and got it locked shot
Give them props up to my nigga KAM (Watts Up)
It ain't no shame in the game that I got
The only places I love a lot is Compton and Watts
And nigga, I don't give a fuck about what clique you in
'Cause I'm from the Nutty but got buddies in the Nickerson
P.J., Main Street, Grape Street, front streets and back streets
But we all from the same black streets
So niggas best to recognize the Dresta
Tired of bein broke so all I think about is paper
And it don't stop to the tic-toc
(Compton and Long Beach together?) [Nigga fuck that] Compton and Watts
Fool, and I'm down for mine

(Get down for yours
I'm down for mine)
