Intro:
Shout outs to Kam for this one
Gling gling..
035 to 011 Nator

See this place ain't home I'm just out here visiting
Tryna make music for the few fans  thats listening
I came to the city of gold
I left the 035 to do it like nobody's did it before
And though this place ain't home man I really evolved
Somehow I managed to deal with the feelings involved
Me and my mama ain't cool since I ran outta home
Shit, it's been a minute since I hit up her phone
But since I'm already here then I should give it a go
Coz I could sit on the throne
And I could fill up the dome
But who knows?
See what's really funny is they've done it before
Coz they did it for EmTee
They did it for Cassper
They can do it for me, I'm an incredible rapper
But even when I run this city I should always keep it in mind

That this place ain't home, I'm out here visiting
Tryna make music for the few fans that's listening

Everybody that's supporting my music
On some true shit
Just know that I appreciate that coz for the first time in my life I feel a lot of resistance
From the people closest to me when I needed  their assistance
They just victims of the system, damn
And the irony of it all is my partially blind sister is the only one that sees the vision
I never thought that my decision would breed division
Amongst the fam, but I'm too focused to leave the mission
So I'm busy packing my bags though I know deep down

That this place ain't home, I'm out here visiting
But it's the only city that I can fulfil my vision in

I hope that all my true fans are listening
I gotta do it for real and stop wishing it
I gotta kill all their shows
I gotta fuck all their hoes
I gotta steal all their gold from right under our nose
And though my pockets been broke
Now I'm going for broke
So many promises broken, now I'm turning so cold

Damn it's all or nothing this is all that I know
So tell the people keep their ears on the streets for the come up
Tell my momma that her son gon' bring heat for the summer
They can't sleep on the beast I'mma feast on these suckers
Y'all niggas need to see all these numbers
See, C I'm the sacrificial lamb that transformed into a goat
That's the greatest of all time and you can put that on quote

So even when they call me the king I should always keep it in mind

That this place ain't home, I'm out here visiting
Tryna make music for the few fans that's listening
