[Verse 1: KAM & (Cold 187um)]
Awww shit, and you don't quit
Brother KAM with another damn gangster hit
Givin' it up, cause everybody ain't knowin'
So try not to choke on this smoke I'm blowin'
Goin' back to the grass, roots for the real
(With the black superman)
Yeah, the man of steel, chill
(But, um, sometimes I feel like a nut)
So here we go, clownin' like I don't know what
I'm pro-Black and crackin' out of control
And when you make dough, they wanna slow your roll
But you know, Dulo niggas, when you spot them
'Cause I'm from that Eastside bottom
The Compton and Watts life, I got pride
It's a Black thing, so ain't no other side
I low-ride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with a rag and bust
I kick up dust, then I shake the spot
Move the crowd and try to make a knot
I got a motivatin' rollerskatin' out on D's
(Damn, here come One Time)
Nigga please, I'm givin' it up

[Hook]
[187] To everybody on the Eastside
[KAM] Right, I'm givin' it up
[187] Just givin' it up, to everybody on the Westside
[KAM] Right, I'm givin' it up
[187] Just givin' it up, to everybody on the Northside
[KAM] Right, I'm givin' it up
[187] Just givin' it up, to everybody on the Southside
[KAM] Right, I'm givin' it up

[Verse 2]
I thank God that I'm still alive
And back on deck for the nine five
And y'all can't say, I ain't got a sense of humor
For every new day it's another new rumor
So numero uno, here's the first segment
I ain't the one who got Yo-Yo pregnant
And then I heard Craig went with a white girl
Never that, a brother like me might earl
But what's the world comin' to?
Real men don't gossip, that's what a woman do
But some of you get it twisted
You must be broke-wristed, so I dismissed it
Kept mobbin' and didn't react
Then now the word in the street is (You know KAM got jacked)
Huh, is that a fact? Well, who got the goods?
'Cause last I heard I was from four different hoods
Now what I look like gangbangin'?
I got words for all y'all birds singin'
Off-key, softly, y'all killin' me
That's why trues just chill and be givin' it up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So last but not least, let me kick the real
'Cause Watts Up niggas be quick to peel
Hittin' three-wheel motion, devotion is true
FOI 'til I die, so what y'all wanna do?
Comin' through just like a new verse
While niggas goin' to Hollywood tryin' to claim a turf
For what it's worth, I just wish 'em will
'Cause bitchmade niggas like to kiss and tell
So I call niggas 'sir' and females 'madam'
And all you will ever hear me say is (I ain't mad at 'em)
Glad I'm livin' like a true
'Cause it ain't about what you're sayin' on a record
It's what you do
And niggas be in violation
Y'all flirtin' with death with you diss the Nation
Ain't no love lost if you cross the line
You flossed, now that ass is mine
I'm givin' it up

[Hook: w/ minor variations]
