(My nigga)
(That's right)

[Verse 1]
Now I look back, and I can remember
Growin' up po, waitin' fo December
25th, when a gift was all I wanted (Yup)
And I didn't have a care in the world, just fun
With all the homeboys around my age
Wasn't no complaints about life in the first stages
The pages turned, and we learned us a lesson-a-day
Keepin' belts and switches away
All play, and no work checks
For raisin' animals and catchin' insects (oh yeah)
It was a everyday thang to see the homeboys and me
Raidin' somebody's fruit tree (see ya)
Little nappy-haired, nature boys
In a concrete jungle, so wherever one go
The others'll follow him like a lost dove
(What's up, loc?) And til' this day I still got love
For 'em, though I don't know 'em like I used to
They still my family, now ask me who's who
And I can tell you about some dirt, or soap-like gossip
But why should I trip?
Because we all got skeletons dwellin' in the closet
So I wonder how is it
People be forgettin' about they homies?
When they make ends meet, let them roam streets
After all y'all done been through
Yo, to put them up is the least you could do (yup)
But now I see just how niggas act
Yo, y'all can turn y'all back
But I still got love for 'em

[Hook]
(Homie that I went to school with)
(Got mo' love for me here)
I still got love for 'em
(My nigga)

[Verse 2]
I used to be able to walk through
Anybody's neighborhood that I wanted to talk to
And see how they was livin', how they life was lookin' (Wassup?) Got they sisters, and ate they mamas' cookin' (that's right)
Young and innocent, the good old days
We started to grow apart, and go our seperate ways
Steady competin' for the most attention
Up at the school house, hours of sittin'
That, they had to find something else to fade me
'Cause they ain't have a letter high enough to grade me
Maybe then some people got jealous
Thought they was smart, and got crushed like relish
So birds of a feather ran together in cliques
Nerds, jocks, and tricks
And the ones just kickin' it in between
Gang-related, you know who I mean
I got love for 'em

[Hook]
(Homie that I went to school with)
(Got mo' love for me here)
I still got love for 'em
(My nigga)

[Verse 3]
And we used to get into it every now and then
Tryin' to prove a point in front of the little women
(Wassup?) Showin' out like movie ushers
We rat-packed them, and then they rushed us
Goin' back and forth, it seemed like forever
Was unpredictable like L.A. weather
The object was just a reputation
(Or some) Or some kinda ovation
That is, until money came into the picture
Now it was on from dusk to dawn
And everything jumped, to a whole new level
Gettin' kicks, comin' up off licks
The devil in disguise, but it was so easy
Affordin' all the shit that we seen on tv (yup)
So whatever it takes, we gotta make them ends
Even if it mean jackin' friends (true that)
So I went my way, and they went theirs
Stayin' out of each other's affairs
Some life was lost, smoked out, and on fat (damn)
And after all that
I still got love for 'em

[Hook]
(Homie that I went to school with)
(Got mo' love for me here)
I still got love for 'em
(My nigga)
