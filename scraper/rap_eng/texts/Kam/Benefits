(Verse 1 )
Uhh!
Uhh!
Uhh!
Pistol grippin'
Trick flippin'
Click trippin'
Sound bumpin'
Get your body jumpin'
Like Scottie Pippen
Dippin' and ridin'
West Coast Eastsiders
Where the blue and red flames
Like cigarette lighters
We street fighters
Like the video game
No pity, no shame
An' we just tell the police
Any ol' thang and remain silent
Never nonviolent
Once you aggress
God bless Dr. King but nigga
We gon' make a mess
An' you need stress
Success is the best revenge
I don't get into shit
Unless the benefit is friends
To be or not to be?
Took me a minute to see
That ain't the question
The question is
What's in it for me?
Ain't nuthin' free
You got to make it worth my while
I never trust a smilin' face
Cause they just refiled my case
To go to trail
The words cut like a knife
I'm out for money, luxury
Good homes and friendships
In all walks of life, nigga

(Chorus)
Benefits
Spending chips and bending whips
Uhh! To make my life less complicated
Benefits
Spending chips and bending whips
Cause for my time, I got to be ?
Benefits
Spending chips and bending whips
Uhh! To make my life less complicated
I'm out for benefits
Spending chips and bending whips
Cause for my time, I got to be ?

(Verse 2)
So what do you go to offer
This black give me ?
Never raise your voice
Above mine
Nigga always speak softly
Show respect
I stay on deck
Mothafuckers
Steadying hittin' licks
On this all day suckers
I don't eva put all my eggs in one basket
From the craddle to the casket
My game is fantastic
Hi Mom!
Shit! I've been a Vet'
Fuck Vietnam
I'm on the internet
W-A-T-T-S dot com
And if I'm not bombing
Ain't none of y'all shit
It's all politics anyway
So I take what I can get
Secure some benefit while I'm living
Islam drivin'
So everyday to me it's Christmas and Thanksgiving
You got to be bringing something to my table (fo' sho)
For just some Eastside fable
I'm ready bullet and able
Cause ain't no record lable
Ever did jack for me
I speak with clarity
Fuck charity, I don't rap for free

(Chorus)
I'm out for benefits
Spending chips and bending whips
To make my life less complicated
Benefits
Spending chips and bending whips
Cause for my time, I got to be ?
Benefits
Spending chips and bending whips
Uhh! To make my life less complicated
Benefits
Spending chips and bending whips
Cause for my time, I got to be ?

(Verse 3)
Let me hold something
Fold something
Crack something
Roll something
I be the nigga like he stoled something
Separate the pro's from the con's
Ho's and the Don's
Those from the John's
? from the time
? from the prime
I spend a grip but won't give snitches
My legal tender "I'm here"
Cause membership hs its priviledges
And I'm a life time cardholder
So I'mma tell you new recruits
You better write rhymes hard, soldiers
I'm a officer but not a gentleman
Out of town swerbing in a rental van
With a health and dental plan
Because I can, Oh! yes I can, Kam
You down to sleep like the sandman
For fucking with my fan ?
So scream
If you ain't about the real
All I'm concern wit is
What the fuck, Kam is getting out the deal
Got mass appeal
Give 'em something they could feel
While this niggas riding shotgun
I'm behind the wheel

(Chorus)
Benefits
Spending chips and bending whips
To make my life less complicated
I'm out for benefits
Spending chips and bending whips
Cause for my time I got to be ?
Benefits
Spending chips and bending whips
Uhh! To make my life less complicated
I'm out for benefits
Spending chips and bending whips
Cause for my time I got to be ?
