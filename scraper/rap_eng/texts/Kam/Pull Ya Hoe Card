[Verse 1: Kam]
Now why must a buster try to act so hard?
Let me clear this bull as I pull niggas' hoe cards
The wool over your eyes, let me remove it
Don't claim to be a soldier when you know you can't prove it
Niggas talk a good game when they lame as fuck
And you'se a coward like Howard, the famous duck
A star-struck groupie might not recognize
That had that ass in a tight spot, checkin' eyes
In real life you'se a midget, niggas thought you was bigger
Homies in the hood askin' me, "What's up with that nigga?"
If you only knew, you'd probably do somethin' drastic
That's why I don't be kickin' it, 'cause niggas is plastic
It was all about money, while I slept she spent
Now honey need to check what she represent
I still got love for 'em, but they need to be told
All that glitters ain't gold
Don't make me pull your hoe card

[Hook]
(Get your hand out my pocket!
What your hand doin' my pocket, nigga?
Get your hand out my pocket!
Get your hand out my pocket!)
Don't make me pull your hoe card
(Now do everybody see these cards?)
(Yeah, I ain't no punk
I don't give a damn where I am
I'm gon' tell the truth)

[Verse 2: Kam]
It always got to be one
Diarrhea-mouth nigga on the street who let his mouth steady run
4-1-1 or call him Mr. Information
Now how the hell do my name always come up in your conversation?
Spreadin' gossip like a goddamn plague
If you don't know me, homie, then don't call Kam, Craig
Spittin' caps on your trap'll get you slapped like a hooker
Sweatin' niggas so hard, think they in a pressure cooker
I took a lotta shit, now I gotta get down
(All them Muslim niggas is marks) Now how that shit sound?
You better ask around before you come up missin'
We got ways to handle people who don't wanna listen
With respect from the streets to the cell blocks
Somebody might find your tongue and your ears in a mailbox
The hell shocks a hoe and bro broke her down
Yes, I guess the card that was pulled was a joker clown

[Hook]
(To be a hoe)
Don't make me pull your hoe card
(He's s'posed to...he's s'posed take the money...)
(Right)
...take the hoe...take the hoe, you know that)
Don't make me pull your hoe card
(Think that this is some joke?)
(Come on, take a card, any card, pick a card)
(Yes! We gon' have to fight tonight)

[Verse 3: Kam]
So will the real O.G.'s please stand up?
Swearin' you a gangsta, but got the wrong hand up
"I put that on the hood", that's your favorite line
Quick to chuck a gang sign and say, "I'm down for mine"
Always talkin' 'bout jail, nigga ain't served one bid
Braggin' 'bout what you will do, or what you done did
You'd be the man if we let you tell it
But your nuts about the size of a shotgun pellet
Seems we gon' have to pull your skirt up
'Cause I know you ain't down to kick no dirt up, word up
It's like a three ring circus, all the clowns I see daily
Like they fresh outta Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey
So let the sideshow begin, step right on in, hoe
Those knowin' don't talk, and those who talk really don't know
Turnin' tricks on the young and dumb, they hot
(But goddamn, Kam, where these busters keep comin' from?)
The word of a nerd ain't no good
Cause O.G.'s run the pen and B.G.'s run the hood
Ain't nowhere to hide, in the streets or on the yard
So if you ain't a true, somebody due to pull your hoe card

[Hook]
(Right, right, that was live
The director captured the essence of street life in a horror-type situation)
(Think that this some joke?)
(Please don't make me hurt you)
Don't make me pull your hoe card
(And we don't even have to hide the moneys that we make from hookers)
(It's all in the cards. It's all in the cards, youknowmsayin?)
Don't make me pull your hoe card
(Think that this is some joke?)
Don't make me pull your hoe card
If you don't want these cards, don't take 'em
