Intro:
Can I talk to yall for a minute
See the game has become a lil twisted
See u gotta cat like me I'mma east coast playa
Str8 from up state
Then you got my man Cam he a west coast playa
Then you got my homey saafir..se he a westsiiiiderrr!!
And we get down like dis

Cam:
You See I'm standing strong
But still don't wanna break no bread
Now yall gonna think I'm wrong when I start going up side your head
Str8 left you for dead
And that's the reason why
I still be riding on these Niggas like giddyup horsey ride
I'm on the wind on my saddle
Bout to herd up some cattle
Cut the head of a snake and save the rattle
You willing to battle
Partna but you fail to see you losing the war
I stand up for what I believe in not leaving enough to score
Bet to show that yall can't ignore my rep for making people shout
Whether popping they ass on stage..or socking they ass on out
I'm like Luke on this money..Dont stop!
Get it Get it..down south they bout it! bout it!
But out west we Widdit Widdit
If you fools admit it
Maybe you wouldn't be on the ground
And everything would be OK I wouldn't have to lay u you down
Yall haters ain't doing me no harm I'm still rich
Just like Old Macdonald on his farm.bia bia ittch!

Chorus:
Niggas be hating me constantly plotting downfall
But I ain't scared of none of Yall
Watch how daddy ball
"I ain't scared of none of yall watch how daddy ball" too short (3X)

Saafir:
Now watch how daddy ball on all of yall
While yall plotting for my downfall
Always gotta watch my back around yall
When I touch the turf, everybody slow down
Shit is getting worse, cuz ain't no money in the town
For what its worth, I have to give my hustle a rebirth
Research another circuit, so I can really work it
I'm sick of sending ripples down the stream of ounces
In order to triple my scratch on the scheme of things I'm bouncing'
Outta town to get mined fuck these mousetraps
Niggas fighting over cheese like rats
My whole family is against me, pullin out gats, what type of shit is that?
You got me strapped with a tight grip
When I'm around fools they tight lipped
But want to jaw jack me to death around a tight bitch
I know the script but while you stuck on some town shit
I be ballin nationwide bound bitch!

Chorus (3X)

Saafir:

One year later with from inflated plan
Just me and my man, touching back down in the town
But in the background, wishing into whispering
He's back! With all the scratch and all the contact
Now what Yall lack contracts mackin the gats (I got that)?
See I'm mobbing with a permanent plan, you say he came up quick (damn)
While you still on the corner standing in quick sand
You think you know what time it is, but your hourglass
Let the hour pass right by you
Why fool? You should have taken more than an hourglass in high school
Instead of snorting dog coughing wit your tweaking ass
I speak fast, stick a move in and out
Now I'm the man with all the clout
Nothing but big shit, mobbing in big ass whips
Own big ships, floating on big battle ships
Fuck a yacht,I'm trynna own a block like the Jewish
Watch how daddy ball this year Saafir knew it!

I'mma tell yall one more time..listen!

Chorus (3X)

(fades)You can't get me..you can't get my crew
