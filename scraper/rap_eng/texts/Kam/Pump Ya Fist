[Verse 1]
I guess you know by now, this is do or die
Anybody killed who ain't looking like you or I
Staying down through the death
We learn young as long as you got breath
In a lung, you keep soldiering 24/7
And get you a piece of this heaven
You got to kill or be killed because the world's corrupt
It's like what's up nigga, what you want to be up
Come with it, ain't nothing but a thang
Oh, so now you want to flip because [?]
But we don't give a four letter word
A set tripple just make me go wet a nerd
Couldn't care less about the physical fitness
Because this one little vandal can handle his business
On the real, I wouldn't feel nothing about it
Because the jails are already overcrowded
Nah, this new generation ain't playing
You see these youngsters is dressed to kill
You know what I'm saying, You wonder why niggas act like they do
Because we made in America, I thought you knew

[Hook]
If living in America got you pissed
Pump your fist
And if you ever had handcuffs on your wrist
Pump your fist
If you hate seeing black people get dissed
Then pump your fist
And you tired of being caught up in that twist
Pump your fist
