[Verse 1]
Lift every voice and sing
Yeah, but we gon' lift every fist and swing
So save the negro spiritual
It's 1992 and niggas need a miracle
And no more song and dance
Like "We Shall Overcome," and ain't got a chance
Y'all stuck on "I have a dream"
Need to put the picket sign down and get on the team
Stand up and do something
Stop beggin' for a meal, 'cause everything is real
Nigga, look at yourself, you in hell
Claiming welfare, or should I say fare-well
Mr. Christian, you was too spooky
Now Bush wanna slave, and Russia wanna nuke me
And the most you can tell me is "Love thy enemy"?
Stay off the Hennessy
Pops, I want freedom, so hand me the nine
You can pray for yours, but I'mma go get mine
Now how long has it been?
For a hundred and thirty-seven years, but neva again

[Verse 2]
God bless America.. but for what?
How 'bout God damn America, the slut? (yeah)
Now I can name that tune
'Cause the land of the free is selling negroes at noon
But how soon we forget
Mention the Holocaust, niggas have a fit
Sorry it's real but I'm fresh out of tears
'Cause "Lynch that nigga"'s still ringin' in my ears
I want freedom, justice, equality, Islam
So it's hard to keep calm
When I'm accused of being racist for lovin' my people first
Now they wanna put me in a hearse
But black people never made white slaves
And we was too lovin' to put Jews in a oven
But the Pilgrims wasn't so friendly then
And by the way, I never ate a Indian
So who's the real savage?
Six feet tall on the average
Count the number of the God damn beast
To the East, my brother, to the East
Say neva again

[Verse 3]
Oh say can y'all see?
It's the home of the slave, land of the never free
American me, the so-called negro
With another verse, so here we go
As long as y'all been givin' me hell
No wonder it's a crack in the Liberty Bell
To tell on America the Beautiful
The bitch need a facelift, for this race myth
And now for you to pull a caper, kidnap, rape her
The penalty is DEATH
Cause we ain't forgave or forgot
Blacks bein' murdered, tortured and shot
Six hundred million one-eighty-sevens
It's bringing wrath down from the heavens
So let my people go Pharaoh, the arrow
Is pointed at your dome, and if we don't make it home
Cancel Christmas
Like EPMD, we got some unfinished business
From way back, payback for your sin
So paleskin, tell a friend, neva again
