Cops be warrin' with the search warrant
Cops be warrin', with the search warrant
Cops be warrin', with the search warrant
Cops be warrin', with the search warrant

[Intro]
I know we bold, better ask about us
We won't be sold, speakin' truth the loudest
We go in so, can't nobody doubt us
Cause somebody gotta speak for the people, and uhh
Soldiers control, we can't be divided
For the people, we represent the righteous
We way too cold, don't even think try us
It's hard truth for the win all my kin's invited

[Verse 1: Paris]
P-Dog, still on that organized warfare
If it ain't 'bout a revolution then I don't care
Break jaws 'till the state laws more fair
Escape dogs and batons and my door and stairs
I'm a panther but I'm hog status
Pro black silverback packin automatics
Where a black man's life is cheap
Between police and the cold ass streets, got us seekin’ freedom

[Verse 2: WC]
I was raised in a hood of hydraulics, narcotics and pistols
Hood politics and bird whistles
Lames can't survive on the turf, so they join the police
Or either kill innocent lives in the church
So I tuck the snug and move with a ya ya
While other niggas singin' peace and all that kumbaya
In God I trust, bust 'til the clip is empty
I'm underground, like Harriet Tubman in some Dickies

[Hook]
Cops be warrin', with the search warrant
They must be snorin' thinking we ignorin' them
Cops be warrin', with the search warrant
Man we got somethin' for them, if they try to storm in
Cops be warrin', with the search warrant
They must be snorin' thinking we ignorin' them
Cops be warrin', with the search warrant
Man we got somethin' for them, if they try to storm in

[Verse 3: Tray Deee]
Never gon' compromise, break or apologize
Ride until I see a black face on the dollar sign
Thug with a conscience, fuck all the nonsense
Blackness the movement while justice the topic
And not just marchin', we pickin' off targets
Death to oppressors when pistols is sparkin'
Khaki suit, my uniform, general, my rankin'
Black revolutionary motherfuckin' gangsta

[Verse 4: Goldie Loc]
Always on the front line, dodgin' all the politics
Huey Newton zappin' 'em away with the gold stick
Sendin' robotic dogs to my door it's crackin'
I ain't runnin' like scary Jakari Jackson
I ain't spendin' one night inside ya FEMA camps
I got no love for republican or democrat
Brothers be glued to their phone
Open up ya eyes, black slavery's still goin' on

[Hook]
Cops be warrin', with the search warrant
They must be snorin' thinking we ignorin' them
Cops be warrin', with the search warrant
Man we got somethin' for them, if they try to storm in
Cops be warrin', with the search warrant
They must be snorin' thinking we ignorin' them
Cops be warrin', with the search warrant
Man we got somethin' for them, if they try to storm in

[Verse 5: KAM]
I see you twist a lotta vicks, so I'm hip to y'all's crime
Pistol Politics on my mind at all times
Everybody know it's racial, but y'all don't wanna say so
So court is now in session, my expression's more than facial
Recognition, no smilin', mission, go wild and
Time to do my own hate crimes and my racial profilin'
I'm dialin' 911, 'cause I'm just gon' rebel
All rydas go to heaven, and cowards go to hell

[Verse 6: E-40]
I'm sick of you people shootin' us unarmed people
The Lord created us equal, but you choose to be evil
A victim of casualty, brutality, do us dirty
The audacity, even though we the ones who pay their salary
I'm smokin' a cigarette drinkin' coffee, back and forth pacin'
Stressed out, heart hella racin'
Trapped in the system, they got me on a leash
Process of elimination, no justice, no peace

[Verse 7: Paris]
It's the killa cali black guerrilla pig chopping organized
Ryders screaming black power, firin' on the other side
Do it for the women, for the babies, for the right to live
Do it for the freedom, fuck the system for the way it is
Raise a fist, it's all about race
And black lives matter so we organize and escalate
Calling all cars for the cause ‘cause we tired of waiting
Don't worry what we gon' say, worry what we bringin'

[Verse 8: Sandy Griffith]
See ya groovin'
We soldiers and we done swore
To rep the movement
And always try to reach ya mind
We ain't playin'
But some never seem to notice
What we sayin'
I guess it's all part of the plan
To keep us losin'

[Outro]
I know we bold, better ask about us
We won't be sold, speakin' truth the loudest
We go in so, can't nobody doubt us
Cause somebody gotta speak for the people, and uhh
Soldiers control, we can't be divided
For the people, we represent the righteous
We way too cold, don't even think try us
It's hard truth for the win all my kin's invited
