[Verse 1]
Rise and shine, it's a brand new day
They say: Awww it's pour rainin, no way
Ain't a cloud in the sky so I can't wait
I gotta get dressed and skate
Traffic is callin', yes y'all and we skirts
To the swap meet for some white T-Shirts
Plus, I've just been paid
So let's roll up to R.P. booth for a skin fade
And throw on the Triple-X as we exit
I gotta have that tight-around-the-neck shit
I'm about to check this naggin' guard
So we all mad doggin' and saggin' hard
Layback pulled his hoe card, I ain't finna stop
For no wannabe robo rent-a-cop
Time to hop, so let's get ghost
Hit the street lookin' neat, full tank
Let's coast in traffic

[Hook 2X]
Watchin' the cars go-by, nobody's catchin' hoo-ride
Wanna test us I don't know why
I'm in traffic

[Verse 2]
Now, I'm fresh out the chair
So what y'all wanna do? We gotta go somewhere
'Cause I feel like givin' it up.. "FEEL LIKE GIVIN' UP"
Oh yeah; One Time just barkin' like hounds
It's too hot, left the parking lot bumpin' the sounds
Damn, a nigga can't even kick it
Tried to frolic and got a Hydraulic ticket
I picked it up off the ground and skated
Court sent me a bill and I still ain't paid it
Made it back to the tilt for a minute
Forgot the heat, black, now I'm back up in it
Because I gotta go get gas
And I'm already knowin' how long that shit last
At the pump like a sittin' duck
But that last ten cents pumpin' slow as fuck
Nah, I can't get stuck out like that
'Cause fools out here no doubt might gat
The toy's lookin' fat in its detail
Rounded up the boys and then we bailed, in traffic

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So what's really goin' on?
I got the rider hoppin' like a bunny, that's money gone
Think it's funny wrong, cause I ain't one to jokes
So trip, as I dip on 100 spokes
To the city, y'all can't understand it
Sounded just like the mothership landed
And it don't quit, ('cause I got one more switch I can hit)
To get y'all tweakin
And sayin' that's the fool that made "Every Single Weekend"
And other niggas don't care
When I be in the cut sayin: 'So what, I see that nigga everywhere'
Then go and switch on the tube
And now they're thinkin' I'm rich cause they see me with Ice Cube
But while they're glued to them screens
I'm out rollin' the Chevy with heavy starch on my jeans
Dependin' on us, to hit y'all up while we're bendin' corners
'Cause I'm known as a peacemaker, on the L.A. streets
Wakin' black people up over gangsta beats
I'm in traffic

[Hook]
