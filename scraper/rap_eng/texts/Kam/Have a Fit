[Hook: Kam]
Oh shit, yeah right there, that's it
Oh shit, yeah right there, that's it
Oh shit, yeah right there, that's it
You make a nigga wanna have a fit!

[Kam]
I got the shit to make your legs tremble
To the niggas I'm a G, but to girls I'm a sex symbol
And I respect who respects me, YES
It's the Kam, god damn I guess I am kinda sexy

[Ms. Red Bone]
But I ain't led on (what?) Turn up my headphone
You heard what I said, you gotta break bread
(And you are?) Red Bone
And I don't come cheap is what I'm sayin
So the only way I'm playin (is what?) Is if you payin like you weighin

[Kam]
Shit, you got me crossed up, baby you get tossed up
If I ain't have no spouse
You'd be hangin around my house like a lost pup
Beggin me to maintain and support her
So bad, I'd probably have to get a damn restrainin order

[Ms. Red Bone]
It's more to me than meets the eye boo-boo, or do you care?
You might just be in fo' a surprise, what size shoe you wear?
(Eleven) Guys be always lyin (who you tellin?) I ain't buyin
What you sellin cause the shit I got'll have yo' ass yellin

[Hook] - 2X

[Big Solo]
Baby I'm Solo, let's take a ride in my lo-lo
Kick your feet up, turn the beat up, go to the mo-mo
(Nigga what you thank?) I just put a dub in the tank
I know a spot that we can stop and get some bud and some drank

[Ms. Red Bone]
If I was stank maybe yeah but you got bank baby
See out yo' income, you gon' have to spend some on me
You try to shoot game at me but I shot it right back
I wonder why you niggas figure that you got it like that

[Big Solo]
Cause I'mma hog baby, straight up, you think I'm ugly?
Well I keep it so real girls still wanna fuck me
You see what gutter niggas do to catch a houserat?
Just use peanut butter and a bigger mousetrap

[Ms. Red Bone]
I'm afraid it ain't that easy to please me (oh well)
I got too much class to be fuckin in some cheesy-ass motel

[Big Solo]
Shit, you can go to hell with that, cause if I really wanna fuck
I'll have your ass buttnaked in the back of my truck screamin

[Hook] - 2X

[Kam]
So many women give that lay back to take a spin
In my wheels, I feels like Pat Sajak {*WOF: puzzle revealed*}
See baby I'm not your average nig' honey {*WOF: wheel spun*}
So when you finally get a turn you be like
"C'mon big money! Big money!"

[Ms. Red Bone]
Oh you funny but sonny I ain't just some hoochie you can yank up
By the time you finished with this coochie you be bankrupt {*whistle*}
Drinkin fifths on the corner, shootin dice, countin rips
But don't trip, at least you got some nice partin gifts

[Kam]
Shit, I lifts up skirts and pull panties to the side
Fuckin with me, you be swallowin more than your pride
I ride like Bloods and Crips between them hips
Until you sayin "Hold up!" I leave both your lips swoll up

[Ms. Red Bone]
I don't know about all that goin down South biz
But if you wanna bet then put some coochie where your mouth is
I'm pussy-whippin niggas and laughin as I'm walkin out
Just for the thrill leave they ass still talkin bout

[Hook] - 4X
