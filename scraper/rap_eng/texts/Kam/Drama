[ VERSE 1 ]
Fuck! Duck down! Niggas is shootin!
And I can't go out like Sir Isaac Newton
Catch a stray one, cause from day one I been escapin
So I figure I'm due for a yellow tapin'!
But it ain't today, thank God
So I kiss my mother and count my bank rod
And then it's back to the warzone
In Southern California you gots to get yours on
A real East Side Story
I'm talkin Compton and Watts, for thine is the glory
A tale of two cities where it's non-stop drama
Not the Apollo joint
But from the hollow-point
-blank, I sleep to the sound of a siren
The shit is so tirin
And other nights I can't even crash
Without the same fuckin mutts turnin over my trash
It's just drama

(More drama, more drama, more drama)
It's just too much drama
(More drama, more drama, more drama)

[ VERSE 2 ]
One-time got my street blocked off
And I wonder what's poppin
But I ain't stoppin
From what it look like a officer got smoked
And most likely it's from some shit he provoked
But regardless the police is kickin up dust
So now it's like 'In Glock We Trust!'
And everybody in my hood is suspects
But ain't nobody snitchin, so what's next?
They try to break the unity
Make an example of a nigga to frighten the whole community
So put out an all-points bulletin and on Kam
And Watts-Up - goddamn!
Ain't nobody said a word
But now somehow I'm under the ghetto bird
On a high-speed chase
The right time in the wrong place
I caught drama

(More drama, more drama, more drama)
It's just too much drama
(More drama, more drama, more drama)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Damn, I just heard about the homie!
That's fucked up, give my condolences to the family for me
Cause I know they took it hard
The shit caught us all off guard
That was my dog, he ain't never meant no harm
I went and got his name tatooed on my forearm
Right after the funeral
Goddamn, that's two in a row
Homeboys I done lost to gang violence
And I ain't been able to smile since
I know everything happen for a reason
But now the blood in my veins is freezin'
Ain't no more feelings left, I'm cold-hearted
I wasn't dearly, but nearly departed
So I know I got a purpose
But L.A. is like a circus
It's too much drama

(More drama, more drama, more drama)
It's just too much drama
(More drama, more drama, more drama)

[ VERSE 4 ]
So another day, another dirty dollar
Like Marvin Gaye sometimes it make me wanna holler
While I try to make a livin, I'm givin
You pee o-n t-h-e U.S.A. - hey
So how much for the ski-mask?
Ain't none of your business what it's for, so don't even ask
Cause America is on the fall
It's every man for himself and God for us all
And action speaks louder than words
From what I hear the Mexicans got the birds
I seem 'em puttin up stores
I say it's time I kick in some casa doors
And play Robin Hood, I been good too long
Takin this shit, you can't expect me not to do wrong
So the stage is set for an Academy Award
And oh, my Lord!

(More drama, more drama, more drama)
It's just too much drama
(More drama, more drama, more drama)

It's just drama

(More drama, more drama, more drama)
It's just too much drama
(More drama, more drama, more drama)

It's just drama
