Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh

She be rocking Victoria
Now open your mouth wide &
Pull them secrets to the side
You know I'm extra swagged up
Hoes got to let me fuck them
Once I back them secrets off
Then I'm dabbing in that pussy
She got ass more ass than a
Stripper a have and I got
Cash more cash than a tipper a have
I'm gonna give the business
Everytime when I get in it
Get her wetter in the kitchen
Pussy clickin like some dishes
Oh yeah don't I show my ass
Don't she bring it back
Don't we leave the mall with
5 hoes and pink bags
Give her the world but
I just give her the dick
And if the nookie be good
Might get vicki outfit
You know that

[Chorus]
She be rocking Victoria
She be rocking Victoria-a-a
She be rocking Victoria
Ohh Ohh (secret) Ohh Ohh (secret) Ohh Ohh

Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh

I live in Victoria Secret buying it all
I love a slim fine pony she be cumin so fast
My bitch look badder than anything
So I put PINK on that ass
She keep that mac on her face
She go shopping at uggs
If it ain't carey or nicki then
She don't go to no club
Body bath and works that shit cray that lingerie
Pussy taste so good her stomach
Smell like body spray
Ohh now let me run that by my red chick
She hit me with that head quick
She put me straight to bed quick
And you know I will never forget her
Cause all want she want for Christmas
