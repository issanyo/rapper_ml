The money)
Im far off,im far off,im far off( oh you can't see me)

The money)

Look, I say stop, shift, and rock it

All i whip is foreign cars ,living life like a star!
See, I ball every day, I ain’t thinking about tomorrow
Cause when it comes around someone always wants to
Borrow
I got choppas on the watch, 50 stoppers on the spot
Got my whip fresh off the lot, then i shot out to the
Shop
They can’t see me, they can’t see me!
