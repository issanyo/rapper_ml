[Verse 3 - Webbie]
Be yourself, or be that nigga on the news
That got knocked up out his shoes by them dudes
I refuse to let a nigga play cruise to where that nigga stay
Politely walk up on him and whip that tool up in a nigga face
What's with all da aimosity because a nigga straight
Smoke a fake nigga like a steak smoking
I ain't the one to mess with I'll leave a nigga stressin'
Find ya wife dead on da floor up in the kitchen
Wonderin' where ya kids at I gott'em all with me
Mail you a finger to show you I mean business
I ain't got my vest on y'all can come on and get me
I got my tech on and I'm taking somebody with me
Got em sitting visioning, Knocking me out my misery
Some niggas say I'm dirty they claiin' dey gone fix me
Better wake up early in the mornin' if you plan on catching me
I'm a tell you lil niggas early... rest in peace
