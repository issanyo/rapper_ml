(Hook) (x2)
I go trough mo' shit than a lil bit
Than a lil bit
Than a lil bit, (yeah)
I go trough mo' shit than a lil bit
Than a lil bit
Than a lil bit, (yeah)
(I go trough way mo' shit) (yeah)

(Verse 1)

Hate to see me with my own shit
Tell them hoes grow up and suck a grown dick
Fuck swag, count my money got my own bitch
19, record label finna own shit
Told my daddy no looking back, cause i'm on now
He said i'm happy cause his baby boy grown now
Plus i'm getting strong now
Come straight from the crib, with Mike from getting lit
I been drinking syrup, with Sprite remixes in
God damn, i miss Lil Finn, until they free Lil Ken
I'm solo in this Benz, fuck hoes, fuck friends
You know i wouldn't be nothing wihout my money
Got my back to the end
I fucked her like a pornstar
And if that pussy go to jail, i'm a hustla'
Shut up before i roast ya'
¨Why you ain't been smiling baby¨
Cause my brother ain't been calling lately
My favorite cousin, she's a cancer patient

(Hook)

(Verse 2)

Some say i changed since i got a lil money
When i was down, was nobody tryna give youngin nothing
Thats why i show my ass
And everyday i live it, like it's my fucking last
And every car that i drove, 200 on the dash
And i guess to be good
I bust a nigga brains on my own damn hood
Told my momma don't worry, cause she know that i'm straight
Now i'm early for my shows, ain't tryna be late
2012, i made it trought another year
Shoutout to the people who are happy, cause i'm still here
Come walk in my size 10's, you wouldn't make it out
Just packing and jacking drug dealers in the South
We hide tattoos and go to war when it's time
And rest in peace to Soulja Slim, a nigga like mine
I'm gon ride for mines, i'm gon die for mines
For my niggas dead and gone, i'm drying ya'll momma eyes
(100 nigga)

(Hook)
