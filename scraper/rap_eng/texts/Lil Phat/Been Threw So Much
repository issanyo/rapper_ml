[Hook x2]
I'd have been through so much shit (x2)
I gotta keep going
I'd have been through so much shit (x2)
I gotta stay focused

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
My life been up and down like a seesaw
I gotta thank God for making white row
Someday I stack them bricks and then I pray on them
They say I 'm wrong for selling dope, my niggas know I ain't
My mamma so dope, so why the fuck I can't
My daddy ain't around, I focused on the bank
But thank you for that nut, you brought a million of it
I'd not been locked up without no bonfire
I know O.G.'s that do plays out of a wheelchair
Transformer cars, break down like folding chairs
Me and Money Mitch, we on a paper trail
On every beat I rap, I leave a paper trail

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Maceo]
I gotta stay focused from niggas showing in the periods
Yesterday I went to prison to visit my brother Kanison
Like three years since I've seen my brother
Walking back to this free world
Dear lord, I just wish that you would free my brother
Thougging in the south side
In my mouth got ballsack
Full of them pills, like [?]
But the time, you remember, all them times we slung down
We had fun with guns, respect my Mac
Pay the bills, pay the gas, burn it still
It's free Benz and trails, Scooter, tell them where they is
I fill with mud, all them stains, I filled with mush, on sight
They tell me chill, I be like it's my fucking life
I been so much

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
I'm no nigga from the hood
Like E, that live the same life as me
Y'all niggas ain't from these streets
Y'all niggas ain't touch no corner
Y'all niggas ain't seen the flats
Y'all niggas ain't run no block
Your trap ain't never hot
Y'all niggas ain't dropped no tops
Y'all niggas ain't buy no watch
Your clique ain't got no gwuap
Free band, we swagging to the top
Y'all nigga don't wanna get shot
G4, I'm taking over
My whole click bosses, wo workers in my circle
But everybody working, we do it for a purpose
Carter, rock the bells and curtains
Me and Rock ride Maybach, drinking behind the curtain
Get a ten million dollar deal, won't stop serving
