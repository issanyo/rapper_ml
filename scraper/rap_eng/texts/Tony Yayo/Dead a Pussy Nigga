[Chorus: Tony Yayo & (50 Cent)]
I dead a pussy nigga on some good word
I dead a pussy nigga on some good word
I dead a pussy nigga on some good word
(You a bitch nigga, we take your shit, nigga)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Everything you a see nigga got, we took it
The block, we took it, your spot, we took it
Every time you think a nigga not lookin'
Nigga, I'm lookin', I send my niggas to book him
We'll dead a pussy nigga on the work
Go 'head, nigga, get a little heart, get murked
Bitch, I be ridin' with the cobra on my lap loaded
Try the fuck shit, a nigga will snap and tote it

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Boy, don't get bodied, niggas dying over nothin'
Brand new Bent, fuck around and break the trunk in
We gon' boguard, I got all my niggas chosen
And that little shit enough, we don't need a bigger motive
Got a to-do move the party with me more
Pullin' up, peelin' off like it's stolen
Two o's on the meter, ain't no tellin' where I'm goin'
'Cept full speed ahead, we'll be slowing down for no one'

[Interlude]
There's a material witness of an aggravated battery
Uh, with a handgun and, uh, they believe, uh
Looks like we have retaliation, uh--

[Chorus: Tony Yayo & (50 Cent)]
I dead a pussy nigga on some good word
I dead a pussy nigga on some good word
I dead a pussy nigga on some good word
(You a bitch nigga, we take your shit, nigga)

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
Got work, that ain't even what I'm mad at
You a pussy nigga, you ain't 'posed to have that
Give me the dope and the dough
And your life, you could have that
I'll let my young niggas share that
Line yo' ass up like a fresh cut
Lot of niggas gon' pass if they test us
Open armed black funeral dressed up
Yayo in the cut with the TEC up

[Verse 4: Tony Yayo]
We get it poppin', my strap have 'em floppin' like LeBron
Teflon don, Rollie on my arm, South Side bomb
Spit the Gemstar out and your face gone
My rap lines is the bomb like napalm
Las Vegas in the Cosmo, bad blonde
As brolic Scarlett Johansson
Fuck her with my Maison Margielas on
Ten years in the game, runnin' marathons
Disloyal niggas got they Halloween mask on
Solo dolo in the Stingray, get my mash on
Hundred horses in the engine, rev the stallions

[Interlude]

[Verse 5: Young Buck]
Take the hit, I get paid first
I use the clip with the curb when the K burst
But I'ma pop this nigga on some good work
A couple pills, lean and some good herb
I got a body on it, do anybody want it?
I'll take you right to the hood and get rid of this bitch
Silencer on it, FBI most wanted
If I find out you snitchin', it'll really get you hit

[Chorus: Tony Yayo & (50 Cent)]
I dead a pussy nigga on some good word
I dead a pussy nigga on some good word
I dead a pussy nigga on some good word
(You a bitch nigga, we take your shit, nigga)
