(feat. Twista)
I don't need a girlfriend
It's money that I'm chasing
It ain't honeys that I'm chasing
I fuck hoes and replace 'em
I don't need a boyfriend
It's money that I'm chasing
It ain't niggas that I'm chasing
Fuck niggas, I replace them
Pedicure, manicure, Dior, Christian all these
Been 63, knew I'm a Christian shorty
I ain't missing mommy, I hate missing mornings
When I'm with the chick the fiends start acting funny
Bath and body bro, smelling like Channel
I jump out that pussy girl for 100 sell
Say I ain't got swag, I stay brand new
I got that big [?] that karate kangaroo
I don't need a girlfriend
It's money that I'm chasing
It ain't honeys that I'm chasing
I fuck hoes and replace 'em
I don't need a boyfriend
It's money that I'm chasing
It ain't niggas that I'm chasing
Fuck niggas, I replace them
Twista
Her body so bad that I be feeling like I'm a go after her
Running like I look on my Eddy Robin pace but I don't got the cardiovascular
When the call I'm chasing after these hoes
I run out of breath and I stay forever calm
But when it come to peace I'm going after the paper, shit
I could run in a marathon
I could ride where I want
Fucking 50 bitches and I got some killers on the payroll
Motherfuckers think I'm gonna say so
Got to make another dollar so I'm hooking up with Yayo
Way more is what we all fish to do
So it's so least I will not gonna be into you
I'm chasing this paper, will stretch me invincible
Therefore a bitch is dispensable
Money over bitches is the principle
So I gotta concentrate, I'm coming in that ugly
Can't be your man, I could be your fuck buddy
Remind me to get you some sex, I hope your day go better
But if lil' mama want a lil' more than that then me and they gonna kill her
I don't need a girlfriend
It's money that I'm chasing
It ain't honeys that I'm chasing
I fuck hoes and replace 'em
I don't need a boyfriend
It's money that I'm chasing
It ain't niggas that I'm chasing
Fuck niggas, I replace them
