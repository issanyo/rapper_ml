[Intro]
Yeah pass that black cherry bottle
It's fuckin' bar tenders vs strippers tonight
My niggas came to spend their money

[Hook: Sen City]
I've been pourin' all night, look at what it made me
Crack the bank now the homies lookin' at me crazy
They like who are you?
Shawty is we f-in'?
(Go, go, go)
Fuckin' up this money, I've been ballin' like a Laker
All I pour is Effen
I blow O's with the vapor, arms all with the paper, ooh

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
I'm on that f-in' wave, on that Effen wave
Black cherry dark skin bitch ass for days
Dancin' on Europeans, MJ
Rest in peace to Prince, blow that purple rain
Ziplinin' in Costa Rica
So many bottles liquor poisonin' my fuckin' liver
Another day duck the grim reaper
Sex, money, and drugs, the devil need another feature
Gorilla glue give me a sense of humor
Got the Kevin Harte chopper in the fuckin' Uber
Got the Kevin Harte chopper in the fuckin' Uber

[Hook: Sen City]
I've been pourin' all night, look at what it made me
Crack the bank now the homies lookin' at me crazy
They like who are you?
Shawty is we f-in'?
(Go, go, go)
Fuckin' up this money, I've been ballin' like a Laker
All I pour is Effen
I blow O's with the vapor, arms all with the paper, ooh

[Bridge: Young Melo]
Join the Effen wave, join the Effen wave
Join the Effen wave, join the Effen wave
Join the Effen wave, join the Effen wave
Join the Effen wave, join the Effen wave

[Verse 2: Young Melo]
If you ain't with the wave boy you effin' up
Got a kitchen full of maids cookin' breakfast up
These others niggas in the way tryna press they luck
I'm just tryna hit the club, fuck some Effen up
And I don't understand how y'all still tryna front
But Pimp already tried to teach y'all niggas how to stunt
Send a case of the Effen and some bitches through
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
The summer's mine, the winter too
I fly to Miami, sleep at the Fountain Blue
Cause I got that money nigga, they know I do
If you don't F with the wave, it might be slow for you

[Hook: Sen City]
I've been pourin' all night, look at what it made me
Crack the bank now the homies lookin' at me crazy
They like who are you?
Shawty is we f-in'?
(Go, go, go)
Fuckin' up this money, I've been ballin' like a Laker
All I pour is Effen
I blow O's with the vapor, arms all with the paper, ooh

[Bridge: Young Melo]
