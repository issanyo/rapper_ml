[Intro: ?]
"Drugs came in, and had everybody going crazy."

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Dog, man, woman, or child; whoever
They get hit in the line of fire, your fault, don't tell
The hood crazy, don't nobody out here give a fuck
Eyes hazy, tryin' to think of how to live it up
Mom raised me, cause daddy doing numbers off his hands
Coke baby, just maybe I'm supposed to be the man
Don't play me; my bail money long, I'm out the jam
Then I'm Swayze; the key to the hood in my pocket, man
Mercedes; I came a long way from the dollar van
And my lady, look like a Coca-Cola bottle, damn
You buy a bitch some heels, she'll walk over you in 'em
That's why I'm never spendin'; iconic momentum
I slut 'em out, bend 'em, lend 'em, and that's the endin'
They face turn lemon the second I rev the engine
G-Unit 'til the endin', cause I don't like pretendin'
Send' 'em far away from here, hear they bitch niggas tremblin'

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
You try to escape from some shit you can't rid
You've been under the streets, too late
Don't give a fuck about how you feel, nothing's fair
You got some your hands on some money, new hate
Nigga, it ain't all good, I wish a nigga would
He ain't got to love me back; I live and die for my hood
Southside, I wouldn't change it if I could
It ain't what they make it out as, just misunderstood

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
Trap money got me livin' like a pharaoh
Got the strap with the air-cooled barrel
Fifty grand, shooter-money in the shoe-box
My bitch'll hit you like Chiquita did Lennox
The streets feelin' like a battleground
Here come a herd of these niggas, I bet I shoot the cattle down
See life, is just like an hour glass
Haters wanna see me up north using cold craft
The fourty-four blast, but I'm hoodied out
Police cameras on the street, but who gives a fuck?
Russian AK with the strap on the shoulder
Will turn one man to about a hundred soldiers
Take this clip, die a million deaths
Gain thirty pounds, nigga, take your last breath
Six-feet deep homie, that's a ugly dirt nap
Six shooters shootin', Russian attack

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
You try to escape from some shit you can't rid
You've been under the streets, too late
Don't give a fuck about how you feel, nothing's fair
You got some your hands on some money, new hate
Nigga, it ain't all good, I wish a nigga would
He ain't got to love me back; I live and die for my hood
Southside, I wouldn't change it if I could
It ain't what they make it out as, just misunderstood

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
You see them niggas? Kill 'em, they've been poppin' shit for mad long
Shotgun to 'em, get your Donovan McNabb on
Sad song, burgundy goo all on the fag lawn
It's a man's world, and them niggas got pads on
Everywhere I go, I get the fishbowl effect
I'm like a fuckin' flat screen, couple bricks on my neck
The break is over, the break is over
I'm back, I'm takin' over, I'm takin' over; click-clack
I'll kill [?], I'm goin' end of chrome-o
Hennessy until I pass out, like Jo-Jo
You talk behind the neck, you a ho, bro
Now I'mma kill 'em softly, ride by 'em in slow-mo
I'm a real nigga, my opposition clear fam
Why should I fear man that wouldn't crush a beer car?
I came in that shit-top pick, and I still am
Reputation tougher than leather, and my wheel Lamb

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
You try to escape from some shit you can't rid
You've been under the streets, too late
Don't give a fuck about how you feel, nothing's fair
You got some your hands on some money, new hate
Nigga, it ain't all good, I wish a nigga would
He ain't got to love me back; I live and die for my hood
Southside, I wouldn't change it if I could
It ain't what they make it out as, just misunderstood
