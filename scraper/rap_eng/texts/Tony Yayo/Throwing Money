[Hook:]
Throwing money in the club, club, club, club
That's how we get it up, up, up, up
Throwing money in the club, club, club, club
That's how we get it up, up, up, up
Bottles no cups, cups, cups, cups
Bottles no cups, cups, cups, cups
Bottles no cups, cups, cups, cups
Bottles no cups, cups, cups, cups

[Verse 1:]
My main bitch really tryin' to pop a collar
My ex bitch still begging me for dollars
But I'm still pimping my chain hanging like a legend
Flying in that four door wrap it all see
And you know it from those smoke fields
I got them all a rock wheel for the dry mills
Running on AMG, getting your money up before you criticise me
And I ball like D. Rose got a shotgun shell and a snob nose
She back, super thick and a nickle's fan
Lil mama rollin' on them triple stacks

[Hook:]
Throwing money in the club, club, club, club
That's how we get it up, up, up, up
Throwing money in the club, club, club, club
That's how we get it up, up, up
Girl give it up, up, up, up
Girl give it up, up, up, up
Girl give it up, up, up, up
Girl give it up, up, up, up

[Verse 2:]
Completed in the virgin Mary pussy
GVS, neck ferrari, SF four coupes
Bottles of ace-T we on glue cups
DJ complaining VIP we rolling up
Champainge, sparked up, here come the owner
He set us all good, I roll on sour
Speakers bumping now I'm tripping off the heat of wave
Throw my money in the air I got more to make
Throw my money in the air I got more to make
Now shorty turn around and make that ass shake
Now blow that candles on your birthday cake
Now she in my sweet about to fornicate

[Hook:]
Throwing money in the club, club, club, club
That's how we get it up, up, up, up
Throwing money in the club, club, club, club
That's how we get it up, up, up
Girl give it up, up, up, up
Girl give it up, up, up, up
Girl give it up, up, up, up
Girl give it up, up, up, up
Bottles up, bottles up, bottles up, bottles up
