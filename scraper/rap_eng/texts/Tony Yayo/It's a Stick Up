[Intro]
Fatality

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
I'm only gon' get bigger, niggas wanna see me lose
Point me to the money I'ma move, this a motherfuckin' stick up
We want everything in twos
Bein' number one don't come with rules
Over how ya figure
Bitches jumpin' out they shoes
How the fuck am I supposed to choose?
Purple weed even more liquor
Foreigns down the avenues
We got shit to fix your attitudes

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
I got my baby hangin' out the window
On some Michael Jackson shit
But my baby ain't three months old
It's an AR clip, yeah, yeah
Foam with the paper plates
Y'all niggas in two oh eights
We in 2016, BMi8
Ghost Protocol, Tom Cruise shit
Got the Uz in the stash with the rubber grip
And I ain't trippin', I'm in Turkey Istanbul rollin' up
50 bottles bottles, 40 bitches, just 10 of us
I love my niggas who the fuck can a nigga trust?
Real drama when I call them niggas pickin' up

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
I'm only gon' get bigger, niggas wanna see me lose
Point me to the money I'ma move, this a motherfuckin' stick up
We want everything in twos
Bein' number one don't come with rules
Over how ya figure
Bitches jumpin' out they shoes
How the fuck am I supposed to choose?
Purple weed even more liquor
Foreigns down the avenues
We got shit to fix your attitudes

[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd]
School of hard knocks grad, you wasn't up in my class
New Orleans nigga rob you in a Mardi Gras mask
Catch you down bad, dirty as a graveyard
Mama workin' slave job
Pa raised me behind bars
Fuck I gotta say to y'all?
Nigga never gave me shit I had to play baseball
Find a fielder's pitch, it's the real talkin' on the mic
Streets got me softer like
All your scars come from fallin' off a bike
My niggas can't read or write
But they keep they heaters tight
Hit 'em up I need the stripes
I don't know how I sleep at night
I think I need space 'cause the world's on my shoulders
Keep my enemies closer
My friends turnin' into vultures

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
I'm only gon' get bigger, niggas wanna see me lose
Point me to the money I'ma move, this a motherfuckin' stick up
We want everything in twos
Bein' number one don't come with rules
Over how ya figure
Bitches jumpin' out they shoes
How the fuck am I supposed to choose?
Purple weed even more liquor
Foreigns down the avenues
We got shit to fix your attitudes

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Had to been dealin' with a copy, I've been occupied
Twin thighs block me in, shrimp and lobster high
Now it feels like there's planets bumpin' when my rhymes collide
When I divide I see that bullshit with binocular eyes
My hearts are pocket sized, check how I monopolized
Rapid fire hits the tire, hope your doctor nice
I hit the weed, toast the sky the helicopter flights
My game proper, game changer, make you drop your price
I'm on the bucket list, bullets almost stop my life
Now my heart's a block of ice
He doubted me I shocked them twice
Powder V on sour D
Man of the hour's me, the powerful know how it be
Give a fuck in all actuality

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
I'm only gon' get bigger, niggas wanna see me lose
Point me to the money I'ma move, this a motherfuckin' stick up
We want everything in twos
Bein' number one don't come with rules
Over how ya figure
Bitches jumpin' out they shoes
How the fuck am I supposed to choose?
Purple weed even more liquor
Foreigns down the avenues
We got shit to fix your attitudes

[Verse 4: Young Buck]
Had it fed with gun powder
All my brothers under the gun tower
My mama tryin' to catch crack sales on her lunch hour
My blunt sour, everything parked in the front ours
I tend to rob when I feel I'm amongst cowards
You know when some niggas is given too much power
You gotta see if they know how to use it
Still shoot the chopper by my lonely don't confuse it
All this fake rapper music, I better win 'fore I lose it
I put every bullet in this clip one by one
Once I do it you gon' here 'bout what I've done, damn
My goal in this game get rich like 50
Never touch another brick and get a bitch like Nicki
Fuck with it!

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
I'm only gon' get bigger, niggas wanna see me lose
Point me to the money I'ma move, this a motherfuckin' stick up
We want everything in twos
Bein' number one don't come with rules
Over how ya figure
Bitches jumpin' out they shoes
How the fuck am I supposed to choose?
Purple weed even more liquor
Foreigns down the avenues
We got shit to fix your attitudes

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
(Fatality) Ya digg? It's goin' down like that that there. We're gonna hit you upside the motherfuckin' head with nothin' but gangster music man. Hey Whoo Kid I want you to him 'em upside the head and let's take off y'all
