[Intro:]
Chronic same color as a frog turd
Have a nigga looking dumb, sorta like an awkward
Violence, I blow violent, I'm so fly, I'm auto pilot
What I wipe for that usa, like it is like Miley Cyrus

[Bridge:]
And I ride, I bounce, I roll up out of nouns
That sticky icky green
That will have you sleep all on your couch
Then I'm standing on one
Got them bottles with no labels
Bitches taken off they heels
Now they standing the tables

[Hook:]
Now I'm standing on the tables
Standing on the tables
Standing on the tables
Pouring champagne on them
Standing on the tables
Standing on the tables
Standing on the tables
Pouring champagne on them

[Verse 1:]
50k's of rosie nigga, watch the club get stupid
Like kobe pictures
Your bitch shows me like goldie bitches
Coco siroc's in my livers
Shawty dropping low like some strippers
I need another drink now
Sat on my phone, hit my bitch on speed dial
By accident, now she mad as shit
But I ain't picking up the phone for the hell of it
100 large on that new panorama
Did your bitch like I did 20 in the slammer
Not sticker, then strippers, in Atlanta
Niggas fickle, I sickle, all my hands up

[Bridge:]
And I ride, I bounce, I roll up out of nouns
That sticky icky green
That will have you sleep all on your couch
Then I'm standing on one
Got them bottles with no labels
Bitches taken off they heels
Now they standing the tables

[Hook:]
Now I'm standing on the tables
Standing on the tables
Standing on the tables
Pouring champagne on them
Standing on the tables
Standing on the tables
Standing on the tables
Pouring champagne on them

[Verse 2:]
Yo, I turn this bitch into a rain forest
I tell your bitch to get your chain for us
And some chicks to get the brain for us
Work it out, train for us
Twist the trees, then I'm gonna twist your knees
Grip the squeeze, swisher weed
Then I'm a ring some leafs
Bitches what I'm seeing be
Malicia g, g, g, g
You nitting on, you know I got your woman on my sleeve
Let's just keep 100, gonna keep it 1000
And she like the way I'm flowing
So her mouth is now my fountain
If she pounding then we bouncing
Smoking loud with my accountant
Plan to make that paper higher
Than a mountain on a mountain

[Bridge:]
And I ride, I bounce, I roll up out of nouns
That sticky icky green
That will have you sleep all on your couch
Then I'm standing on one
Got them bottles with no labels
Bitches taken off they heels
Now they standing the tables

[Hook:]
Now I'm standing on the tables
Standing on the tables
Standing on the tables
Pouring champagne on them
Standing on the tables
Standing on the tables
Standing on the tables
Pouring champagne on them
