(feat. Mobb Deep)
They keep begging for a body bag
Deep cut my shit put them in a bag
Lay 'em out leave them toe tagged
They keep begging for a body bag
My gun got them on a...
It looks so pretty taking out competition
It even got a flashlight on the barrel
I click it on and I wave it at you
You think it's god when you see the light
But you won't see god homie you gonna die tonight
Marked for death let the bullets be the written symbol
I point them all and rock well right out the window
When it come to beef I squeeze on targets
My hands all bloody like rocky in a meat market
I squeeze harder than a python, with that 357 called python
Niggers hate my but my skin is thick
Point them out and I... hit him in his bricks
Now's all peace pouring out a little liquor
He died forced up, from a trigger finger
They keep begging for a body bag
Deep cock my shit put them in a bag
Lay 'em out leave them toe tagged
They keep begging for a body bag
They keep begging for a body bag
Deep cut my shit put them in a bag
Lay 'em out leave them toe tagged
They keep begging for a body bag
Yeah, you ain't got a bag... I got you
Hold still show you what the Glock do
... a nigga catch a holy ghost
Hole in the spine leave them with a scoliosis
... before I let you hold one
Lay for right where your... from
Fuck you out of here, you playing in the street
My niggers up and ready are you coughing up meat
I ain't lost enough sleep for drama to wear me out
Your pussy everything that your mouth is like...
No one is prouder whenever they see me out
Soured up, straight blown through a 3...
My finger hit you like money coming
Body bags want me nothing keep the guns bumping
Talk cheap but the slugs here cheaper
Know you want a body bag, but here's the grand reaper
They keep begging for a body bag
Deep cut my shit put them in a bag
Lay 'em out leave them toe tagged
They keep begging for a body bag
They keep begging for a body bag
Deep cut my shit put them in a bag
Lay 'em out leave them toe tagged
They keep begging for a body bag
Fuck that I gave a lot of passion
Let a lot of niggers live show a lot of compassion
I never took advantage of you weaklings
I could of green light the universe... beat down...
And be a massacre if I give the word
So I only serve those who truly deserve
This level of punishment is not for beginners
You acting like you can handle it
I'm a give it, I'm handing out life support systems
Shit bags and... for free, come and get some
When you see me in the club
Cause I ain't come for bitches, I come for blood
It's the return of the mac and revenge of the thug
Watch the attitude switch up and extract the bitch up
But now they in the present of some legendary niggers
Bumy ass nigga got his dummy ass hit up
They keep begging for a body bag
Deep cut my shit put them in a bag
Lay 'em out leave them toe tagged
They keep begging for a body bag
They keep begging for a body bag
Deep cut my shit put them in a bag
Lay 'em out leave them toe tagged
They keep begging for a body bag
