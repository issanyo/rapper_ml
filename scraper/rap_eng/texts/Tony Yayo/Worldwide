[Intro: Snoop Dogg sample]
Yeah, yeah, yeah let's slow it down a lil' bit Whoo Kid

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
We some worldwide niggas cut the line in immigration
European time different
We some worldwide niggas man we came from the bottom
Now we on some black rich shit
Y'all niggas local, we worldwide
Y'all niggas local, we worldwide
Y'all niggas local, we worldwide
Y'all niggas local, we worldwide

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Uh, your problem
It got me out the bottom, I'm designer (?)
Competition get a stomp, defeat
How can y'all compete?
Masterpiece for mansion, wrist for hire or your time is cheap
Pray the Lord your mind'll keep
Lose it right on survivor's street
Never turnin' back on this life
Hope I live twice
Traps all over let the weeps in, dodge it few times a night
You see the price we share the same goal, powerful minds alike
Success up under this got these bitches sour, few thousand fights
I leave the world while rappin'
I shake the ground, the girls collapsin'
Enterprise went international, fit me in foreign fashion
I just took the whip about 160, my commas laughin'
Gettin money 'til the man come get me, I'm in traffic
Reputation dead on impact, I'm bombin' accurate
You gon' settle for the sum your smokin', I wanted that shit
Winnin's always in the conversation, you goin' backwards
Never been no room for fuckin' up and ain't no passes

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
We some worldwide niggas cut the line in immigration
European time different
We some worldwide niggas man we came from the bottom
Now we on some black rich shit
Y'all niggas local, we worldwide
Y'all niggas local, we worldwide
Y'all niggas local, we worldwide
Y'all niggas local, we worldwide

[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd]
I'm not used to ordinary niggas, Derrick Fishers
Merry Christmas, it's a Kidd gift when I rap to every listeners
It's the story, born loser grew to be a winner
Microwave hot pocket for dinner
Pockets thinner
Now I can't fit shit up in 'em
Versace denim, Versace robe
My cousin used to beat my ass from stealin' all his clothes
Flashbacks gettin' laughed at by all these hoes
But I got somethin' for all of you haters
All of this paper
I hope you catch all of the vapors
Fuck all your favors
Am I my brother's keeper? Cain killed Abel
They say you can't eat, you gotta turn the table
Rest in peace Nate Dogg, y'all better lay low
Ferarris in the garage, pullin' hard since I was stable
Hey fuck the industry word to my brother Yayo
I'm an a-hole, if you say so
My paper's straight though
