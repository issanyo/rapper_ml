[Chorus: 50 Cent]-[X2]
G Unit in the house
What nigga what?
G Unit in the house
What what what?
G Unit in the house
What nigga what?
GGGGGG G Unit

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
In my hood you get no points for ya jump shot
As soon as the sun rise we back on the block
The stress got me feelin' like an old man
And I stay on point for that red and gold van
Its a free lance performer Yayo be a pro
Cause the flows been hot since G.I. Joe
Yo my rhymes'll have you nodding
Like war in the streets
So the freaks give me ass like toilet seats
Get at me you really think you holdin' Big Daddy?
So wheres your indoor court and bowling alley
I got heart like a Hoover Crip, but bust slugs
Like an Inglewood Blood
I mingle with thugs
My single 'gon buzz
Ya boy export get rid of the drugs
I still bag my dope up with a mask and some gloves
I used to have 8 balls in my 8 ball jacket
Now a thug Lex coupes
Like Luke in Dukes Of Hazzard

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Put carpet burns on these rats for several days
Till they need bandages on they knees like Pat Hueing's legs
I'm always with the biscuit
The only way I get blue balls
Is if a bitch had blue lipstick
You broke rob more blocks
Cause you ain't got to know
How to break dance to wind up on a cardboard box
I'm Guccied down to my socks
Groupies houndin' the spot
We perform at
Keep goopies around for the cops
She'll be down for my watch
I ain't generous or courteous
I'm runnin' from a dirty bitch
Nigga you thirty six
You don't want it with the kid at all
Same shit bigger bathroom my niggas brawl
When we come after you it ain't no gray shots
The SIG will leave a hole in ya chest
Bigger than Flavor Flav's clock
You pussy, you wouldn't even pop the smallest chip
Cause on the inside you softer than a mozzarella stick

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I'm the leader of the new school now nigga what?
I got a 44 bulldog
I'll tear your bitch ass up
I pop off nigga front
I'll put my knife in your gut
Have you in ICU screamin' ahh I'm cut
I go rrrraowr, rrrraowr like a dungeon dragon
But I keep my pistol on me so my pants be saggin'
Everytime i'm in the house niggas grill a nigga
Cause they feel a nigga
I'll kill a nigga
You speedin' shorty better stay in ya lane
Before I send one of my soldiers
To blow out ya brains
I'm the general what?
You salute me
You a dead man if you attempt to shoot me
I done lost some of my brains watchin' military flicks
Got the whole G Unit on some military shit
[Lloyd Banks:] Private Banks requestin' permission to speak
[50 Cent:] Speak nigga!
Man it's dangerous when
Theres discipline involved in street niggas

[Chorus]
