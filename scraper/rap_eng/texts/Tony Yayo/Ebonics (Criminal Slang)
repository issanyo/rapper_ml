[Intro]
Rest in peace, Big L
Yeah, Big, ‘Ebonics’, nigga, ow-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
The studio is the traps, snitch-niggas’ll rat
Her ass stun, that's a DR flight back
A hood ho is a thot, .40's the Glock
She give me head, we call it top
In them foreigns, they BMWs
Bitches you want to fuck; WCWs
The strip club is the 'bando
A thousand grams is a kilo
Shoot the fair one, catch a fade, yo
New Jordans is the JOs
Got to check in, that's the PO
In the ladder, that's the chopper
Little niggas on IG dick-riders
Fake friends, we call them switch-siders
The cops is pigs, rest in peace to Garner
Blunt stuff, we call them Godfathers
My BM is my baby mama
You want problems? That's drama
Good weed is the Girl Scout
Good weave is Brazilian hair, bitch with her tits out

[Bridge]
'Ebonics', nigga, rest in peace to Big L
All the legends, nigga, let's go

[Verse 2]
Trollers is the new haters
Swipers is the new hustlers
Get catfish, but fish scale 'bout undercovers
Play mean you fool, fool mean we eat
Your face on the shirt, you six feet-feet deep
We really creep, y'all common creep
I'm about to cut, shorty pussy deep
Tens cars the fleet, ten broads on fleek
That mean ten bad bitches in my condo suite
Get some roll-up, that mean cigars
Swishers, Dutches and you can do the Backwoods
Actavis, that's the lean
The Unit, that's the team
My Murda Mook a nigga, that mean my bars is mean
My whole life a dream
I don't want to wake up
The code word to cut his face is a night shape up

[Outro]
How my night shape up, man
Rest in peace to Sonic
Shout to the whole riders still
Guy Brewer, Big L, 'Ebonics', ow-ooh-ooh
