(feat. Desperado)
El chapo
Was in the Sinaloa cartel
Yayo we back
[Tony Yayo:]
45 acp it weigh 20 ounces
Actress staring at me like teleprompters
Hit the cell bad reception in the helicopter
I'm goin hard in the paint like waka flocka
Flip flop paint back seat hold the chopper
I only smoke the L if it's rolled proper
Ciga Sinaloa Cartel make bail
With that kinda money you could break out the jail
Meth amphedamens shipment is headin north
Feds raid I'm latifah in set it off
6-50 tops off new body type
Uptown mami right she from the heights
She the snotty type, but my money long
Now I'm with her long slip her out her thong
New armani top is in the windsor knox
I got her higher than a snoop in a wiz block

[Chorus x2: Tony Yayo]
We hit sour, when are nerves twitch
M.o.b nigga fuck a bitch
Get rich or die tryin till I'm in a ditch
I'm in another world I'm in the matrix

[Bridge: Desperado]
Your mad cause I'm that nigga and your bitch just wanted me
You think that it's the money but it really ain't the cream
It's sad cause that's your wife and it was just a nut to "D"
See me in the zone I'm in the matrix can't you see
Heavy links got them bricks in the low riders
They get in with more tricks than the globetrotters
They hate to bring it to the states cause it's on fire
Too many snitches niggas singing like they on choirs
I'm on point you can't fuck with the wrong buyers
Niggas scheming they ain't eatin like they on diets
Always see me with the heater cause they might try me
Cause my looks could be decieving till they start flying

[Chorus x2]
I'm in another world I'm in the matrix
I'm in another world I'm in the matrix
I'm in the matrix
I'm in the matrix
I'm in another world I'm in the matrix
I'm in another world I'm in the matrix
I'm in the matrix
I'm in the matrix
