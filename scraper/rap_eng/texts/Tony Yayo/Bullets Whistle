[Hook]
My bullets whistle like
And fly right past ya dome
My bullets whistle like
A hundred shots a nigga gone
My bullets whistle like
I got that typewriter tommy gun just like Capone
My bullets whistle like
6 feet deep another homie gone

[Verse 1]
We juggle women and we smuggle them bricks
New 750 model hug on my dick
I send a hater, hater a postcard from paradise
The beach sandy, that money got the setting right
No money, less stress
Now all my enemies are in my book of death
I'm in that Luis Bomber
Yeah my car is like the stealth bomber
I see popo, I mash when I hit the corner
Money at the bar raise the global economy
Global phone leer jet recession, don't bother me
Herme's slippers fat ass cell
Two sisters; I'm so ambitious like Pharrell

[Hook]
My bullets whistle like
And fly right past ya dome
My bullets whistle like
A hundred shots a nigga gone
My bullets whistle like
I got that typewriter tommy gun just like Capone
My bullets whistle like
6 feet deep another homie gone

[Verse 2]
I'm far from a legend, I'll never be one
Street hall of fame, die with a big gun
Like E-Money, my Troy at the sports bar
I get money and blow it on a sha'pa
Interscope wanna divide and conquer
Momma always told me don't trust em
R.I.P to Derry & Albert
To get an education, need a 40 cal 'cuz
Lock your doors and hide your children
Shorty 13 years old and he dead on linen
Same day, different shit

[Hook]
My bullets whistle like
And fly right past ya dome
My bullets whistle like
A hundred shots a nigga gone
My bullets whistle like
I got that typewriter tommy gun just like Capone
My bullets whistle like
6 feet deep another homie gone
