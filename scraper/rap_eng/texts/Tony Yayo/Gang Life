What that Blood life be like?
What that Crip life be like?
What's that Vice Lord life like?
What's the G.D. life like?
Put in work, this initiation
Put in work, this initiation
Put in work, this initiation
Put in work, this initiation

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
It's a sunny day in Southside, my man got tossed
Got his brains blew out on the handball court
Word is T said suttin' to Craig's baby-momma
Craig got upset, and shot him with the Llama
Craig in the cut, Blood niggas put him up
Plane in PA, land casual wit' a slut
And he still walk around with the semi that killed T
He let his big bro push and re-up in Philly
What little do we know 'bout his Philly connect
That nigga T had fear bleed, he'll filll he correct
Craig re'd-up once, Craig re'd-up twice
Sour Diesel, two pounds, everything look nice
But the third time, suttin' fishy, the nigga Izzy
And two goonies, the roof loony
The Mac extended, Craig ran off like the Jamaicans in the Olympics
Jumped out the window when he got into British

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Blood life, Crip life, G.D, Vice Lord
Rodgers, Tookie, Hoover, Larry yo
Them El Salvador, Ms-13 niggas bangin'
Only 13
Vice Lords love me like Jeff Gorde, if a nigga ask for it
Hit him from the back, put his brains on the dashboard
They say OG Mack, brung the Bloods to the East around 9-3
In C-7-3
Crips and G.D rep the 6
Bloods and Vice Lords rep the 5
OG Puddin, Corey bangin' them 46 Clover Boy niggas do they thang
Get shot for your flag on the wrong pocket
You wanna know when them Coke Wave niggas droppin'
For my nigga Yay, shoot a nigga face off
In broadday, and tell 'em it's Coke Wave

[Hook: Tony Yayo]

[Verse 3: Max B]
I don't know what it is to be Blood or Crip but I twerk
Nigga it's the Silver Surf
Got my lil' Gain Greene soldiers on deck
They waitin' to take jewels, they waitin' on the plate of food
Wait to make a move when I say so
Prego fallin' from the sky, laying all the baller guys
All of I, naw nigga, you can't have none of the boss, Bigga
Leave a nigga corpse to quiver
Frost and shivers, let's get that nigga in the Benzy gleamin'
The boy P.O. deliver
Pieces all fresh out the factory, courtesy of streets, I'm blessed
My momma couldn't said it the best
Started 1090's out in Trenton
And I ain't even Blood, I'm a dentist possibly facing a life sentence
I bet ship set out
Streets is saying I got a so-called hit out
Get out
