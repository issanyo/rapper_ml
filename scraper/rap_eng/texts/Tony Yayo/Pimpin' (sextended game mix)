[Tony Yayo] Verse 1
I lay my pimp game down when it comes to these bitches
They do what I say and obey all my wishes
Wash all my clothes and clean dirty dishes
I turn a sweet bitch to a switchblade sister
While you shop on Melrose buying hoes shoes
I'm in Mickie D's buying number 2's
Now get yah ass on the track and get that dough for me
I'm the number 1 pimp so she chosen me and my hoes where ballers and rollers be
They collect them G's and give em to me
I'm pimpin no perms just gators
Pimpin I'll show ya how to stunt on them waiters
Pimpin flossin in that new cadillac
Pimpin chinchill with the fur hats
Pimpin I'll show ya how to school a hoe
When you chasin them bitches I'm chasin the dough
YEAH
[Tony Yayo] Chours
I don't love

Cuz baby I'm pimpin

And I know your feet hurt in them damn Payless
