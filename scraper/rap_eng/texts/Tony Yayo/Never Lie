El chapo
Huh, but I'm back man
It's the unit, yayo
I am the streets y'all niggas know what it is
Keep sleeping on the under dog
Yeaa

[Verse 1:]
Wiz said that his checks look like phone numbers
Well my checks look like overseas phone numbers
Throw a bitch out the hummer like hoochie
It's really a uzi cause jack boys feeling loopy
On my grind like jamaicans with that arizona
European whip, amsterdam aroma
My short term goals is a vicky model
My long terms 1's swiss acount with zero's
Bad meter, the bitch bad
Similiar to vida guerrero and that chilli peper peta ass
2 11 jag aqua color
Roll that aqua man up ducking undercovers

[Chorus: x2]
I swear I'm never lieng on my dead niggas
I just fucked 2 hoe's off twitter
Stack chips, stack figures
I never lie on my kids or my niggas

[Verse 2:]
Free remy, free boozie, free t.I
P home he did 3 4 dilly
Gun laws change, 3 years of top
Now they tryin to give you 4 for the stashbox
I'm like tiger woods
I've got 5 birdies, 1 eagle, 2 boogies
That's that golfer talk
I got them dope fiends nodding off
I do donuts in the porsche when I'm slidding off
Cartier buckle, cartier glasses
I got a blackberry that's full of asses
I slide in a blackberry milasis
Roll the cherry pie now I'm high like nasa

[Chorus x2]
