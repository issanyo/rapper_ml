Intro
Yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea

It'll only take one second and then it's over
Life is over, never let your guard down nigga'
Nigga's shot up the way, the precinct said it's the Lord house
Shooters said it's just four walls with some faith in it
Seen us, targeted and he sprayed in it
Flip work, I'm the perfect courier
Records don't sell, I make it hot like Ebola
Leaches spreadin' all these foul rumors
I'm eatin' cunt shell in the Aruba
Aphrodisiacs skybox with binoculars
While the Feds watchin' us with the same binoculars
Feindin' for that triple fat goose
Almost got shot for my starter jacket comin' from school
Shout out to Double XL, Complex Mag
Source magazine, Vibe money's in the bag
It was all a dream, now we got money
Now we got money, now we got money
Zero gravity seats in the Bentley truck
Cops wanna' hit me up just like Walter Scott
I'ma shootin' for that king the street spot
My foreign cleaner than a fiend that's in detox
Your raps really don't matter
You need bars [?] called John Taffer
My climb to the top I need a long ladder with a long clip
And I don't trust nobody out my own clique
The devil everywhere in the industry
Satanic nigga's drinkin' blood with my enemies, they all a bunch of frenemy's
Killin' every nigga' in sight
Killin' every rapper in sight

Outro
Quit playin' nigga'
Kill y'all nigga's man
Shit man
Know the Feds listenin' though
You what I mean? So we gonna' play it smart
IG gangsters you know what I mean that's what y'all are
IG gangsters man
See if you like that in real life shorty
Ha ha ha
