[Verse 1:]
Get money, new new name kimmy
500 rims between a legend I'm between many
Hermezz stairs, with a bad bitch
She horny off them oysters feed her disco stick
The ak is like a pogo stick
I put holes in a rat on some popo shit
Us open, polo shit
Don p life hoes get rozay dick
See my roof is invisible my life is great
When I die my kids got millions in my pshycial traits
It's all a race, in a zoo of logical population
Da world is a zoo and these animals is waiting
On the prey, but not me
Kamikaze, pass the judge 19k

[Chorus:]
Put my back against the wall
You know I'm goin pop that
Put my back against the wall
A 100 shooters I'l cock back
With my back against the wall
I never fall under pressure
With my back against the wall
I'm usually duckin detectives

[Verse 2:]
Homocide flash my mug shot
Cause I'm killin every nigga in sight like buck shots
Nigga run up on me think my chin is glass
I bet this 4-10 strap boy I'l spin your ass
Tony yayo is a brand builder
You ever have fillet minjuon dinners in bugatti dealers
I fuck with colombians and mexicans
That play with more keys than alicias hands
My chapol got the bezzle face
Vest with the metal plates
I'm strapped when I wear my jewels
Cause I rap nigga I ain't fooled
I click clack cause my gun game cool

[Chorus]
