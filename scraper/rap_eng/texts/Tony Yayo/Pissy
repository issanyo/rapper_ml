(Hook)
Pissy in the motherfucker
Pissy in the motherfucker
Pissy in the motherfucker
Just got me pissy in the motherfucker

(Verse)
Channing,like Billy Mays with them take up brollies
All new money, y'all money looking moldy
50 case of rosey, black diamond rosey
Should be feeling on me champainge spill it on me
Pig hill ,120 ville VIP
Get the game set ready, I ain't seen no beef
Somebody got a pissy in a motherfucker
Pop on my wrist but I ain't going hand cuff her

(Bridge)
Tripping of an OG, fray day
All this dough in my pockets never play games
'Cause I take you to the spot, that's sacred
Got her friends in the mood, she's a freak

(Hook)
Pissy in the motherfucker
Pissy in the motherfucker
Pissy in the motherfucker
Just got me pissy in the motherfucker

(Verse)
Leonard Daley p1,silence the lamb
Crack noise on the gun
Teflon cops out the window of the slightest drama
Pull up on a hater like a melodrama
I like your baby muff but I don't kiss her I don't hug her
I'm Charlie Sheen high in the beam I burn the rubber
A broom handle and banana clip
I wave a broom stick,like the wicked witch
And hope I find snitch
I pull a ring when I take a piss
She see the rocks on my wrist
She starts to trip,smoking radioactiv Phs
She got her boobs done up and they all on me
I'm thirty seconds from mars just like the rock group
Everybody know his fans never stopped you
G6 it, the club VIP out in Paris
Snatch a redhead beat it up like a savvy

(Bridge)
Tripping of an OG, fray day
All this dough in my pockets never play games
'Cause I take you to the spot, that's sacred
Got her friends in the mood, she's a freak

(Hook x2)
Pissy in the motherfucker
Pissy in the motherfucker
Pissy in the motherfucker
Just got me pissy in the motherfucker
