(feat. Lloyd Banks)
I know you think I'm selling keys
But I only sell fiends
I know you think I'm selling keys
But I only sell fiends
I know you think I'm selling keys
But I only sell fiends
I know you think I'm selling keys
But I only sell fiends
Cuffing this
Cuffing, cuffing this
I been cuffing this
I been cuffing this
But I only sell fiends
I hate getting familiar with these niggas and bitches
All they do is get comfy and think I'm sweet like swishes
I spent half of my career on a private jet
Hit the jacks, get a hoopla, go wash your scent
Think it's sweet to have my shooters come wash your scent
I'm in that Wu Tang shit, nigga, protect your neck
All these niggas on my dick, blow Bruno
Jewish lawyers Scott leaning, always find a loophole
Hermes attire, sharper than a cactus
Half a pound of cat piss, model slash actress
I'm flipping things like gymnastics
My bricks doing simmer sauce, yours doing back flips
That means you hustling backwards
I'm back to the feature, I re-up the fastest
Rows go, you blow, make all the hoes blow
Twenty keys turn my yard into a car show
I know you think I'm selling keys
But I only sell fiends
I know you think I'm selling keys
But I only sell fiends
I know you think I'm selling keys
But I only sell fiends
I know you think I'm selling keys
But I only sell fiends
Cuffing this
Cuffing, cuffing this
I been cuffing this
I been cuffing this
But I only sell fiends
Missed to get a model weak, movies in the palace weak
Your lady ass snicket, run around like 100 thousand feet
Nigga, I got her tripping, leaning, dying over
Nigga, we riding triple beans with dimes for chauffeurs
My system's hidden, got the coppers hating
Friend or foe, I'm popping strips between the combination
My mind is racing, Gucci stepping, probably gracing
Two, three seconds, I'm impatient, breaking records out the basement
Break a brick over these strippers, weird bitches call me daddy
Solid gold pictures, take my business out the alley
Married to the fucking game, all the work, I feel the same
Get with Scott up, nigga up, but dollar signs are hella pain
I know you think I'm selling keys
But I only sell fiends
I know you think I'm selling keys
But I only sell fiends
I know you think I'm selling keys
But I only sell fiends
I know you think I'm selling keys
But I only sell fiends
Cuffing this
Cuffing, cuffing this
I been cuffing this
I been cuffing this
But I only sell fiends
Movie chick cross bows with exploding tips
Groupie bitch, in the rows I expose my dick
Under my pillow dragging breasts around, shoot fire
Laying in my bed, she tell it like Tyana
Every nigga ain't your homie, death before dishonor
45 for gram, a drought's on the corner
For shit rounds got 15 docks in 'em
Hit his chest cavity, for sure I'm talking 'em
Max in the MCM nap sack
In the 90s they... and long had the long foundation
Elephant buildings, made a couple millions
I know you think I'm selling keys
But I only sell fiends
I know you think I'm selling keys
But I only sell fiends
I know you think I'm selling keys
But I only sell fiends
I know you think I'm selling keys
But I only sell fiends
Cuffing this
Cuffing, cuffing this
