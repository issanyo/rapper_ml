[Hook: Danny Brown]
I'm from the D like Big Meech
Swisher sweet peach
Caprice on fiends, creased jeans on leather seats
I'm everything these lames will never be
I'm everything these names will never be
I'm a cool ass nigga try to play me like I'm soft
And you gon' see them red beams like cyclops took his glasses off
Like cyclops took his glasses off
Like cyclops took his glasses off

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Y'all Molotov, I'm nuclear
Rats say I ain't shit, white hoes say I'm tubular
Nigga I ain't cool witcha, fucking break your fibula
Can't wait till Lil Wayne get out, but right now rat it's Nivea
Psyche, I ain't playing, I like hoes with they eyes blue
Little niggas always crying like Caillou
Uncouth, 40 ounce, cruise out the sunroof
Right now my turn yours'll come, mind you
Trying to figure out a way to bottle up pussy juice
Have my PayPal clicking, sales going through the roof
Y'all niggas cooch, my pockets on Bruce Bruce
You fruits got no loot, just brute and fruit juice
When I swoop in coups, heated seat like masseuse
Dukes shoot up goose from chicks looking like hoops
My nigga who is you, you must be sniffing glue
I leave you stiff like white boys' hair with the mousse

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Fuck the cash, money come fast
Four-door jag, all my bitches bad
You got no hoes with your big head ass
You'd become a barber just to push your line up back
Nah I'm playing, better off with the bars
Getting sports bar waitress out her sports bra
Get head for free, no spending
All your bitches bored like you told them the ending
Real pimping, gets em out is macking
Text a bitch "lol" but I don't be laughin
Coke head ho too high to get mad
Plus, her only reflex is no gag
Bad, all my bitches bad
Climbing on that ass in the four-door jag
Dick bigger than them words Keith Murray use
Once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
