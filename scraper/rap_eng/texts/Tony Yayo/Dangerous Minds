The future don't care no more
NYPD care is capturing nigga, go to war
High school, they hit you in the daytime
Saw Ramilio ain't in class, dangerous minds
And everybody going gang signs
My heirs know a face laced with a thousand diamonds
And I done fucked about a thousand dollars
And been around the world about a thousand times
Rest in peace to Trevon Martin, got the straps and the police
And the Aston Martin, fuck 'em and fuck George Zimmerman, too
And I got no love for the boys in blue
Hit, pop police, keep trill in my car but my feet near mule, got my strap in a brawl
Click, clack, take that, fuck 'em, pounds in AC for the low one, try to touch 'em
My father always said you made your bed, lay in it
My homie in a box 'cause he staying shit
Whole click strapped up 'cause we staying shit
We staying shit, we staying shit
D Way nephew is still gang banging
Chicago where you living, dead or in prison
Killers is what the box breathes, kilos is what the ox leave
My niggas rich off the bong weed
'Cause life stress goes away off the bong trees
More trees than a lumberjack, my own click, galaxies
You soft boy, you running that
Watched your powers, our dismay
I give them lead, showers with AKs
Haters in the street wanna see me obsolete
I do 'em dirty like MLB clicks
My father always said you made your bed, lay in it
My homie in a box 'cause he staying shit
Whole click strapped up 'cause we staying shit
We staying shit, we staying shit
We staying shit, we staying shit
