See me coming, see me coming, see me coming
And yeah, I'm stunting, yeah, I'm stunting, yeah, I'm stunting
But you my shorty so I brought a lil' something for you, baby
You so fly, you so fly, girl, her persona is nice but she ghetto
That's how I like it, that's how I love it, yes, I'm a player, I'm there for fucking
I think a thug is ready to fall in love
I think a thug is ready to fall in love
Ready to kick off the French Riviera, high heel Louis
They 1400, the girl's gotta ooze it
She said she never played the drum before
But she straight from the hood where they pump that raw
Smoking belladonna, that bullshit tighter than Madonna
Like a virgin, now we splurging, 62, move back and curve it
Put that working, that's for certain, but I ain't bringing sexy back
I flash my jewels and flash here 60s style
See me coming, see me coming, see me coming
And yeah, I'm stunting, yeah, I'm stunting, yeah, I'm stunting
But you my shorty so I brought a lil' something for you, baby
You so fly, you so fly, girl, her persona is nice but she ghetto
That's how I like it, that's how I love it, yes, I'm a player, I'm there for fucking
I think a thug is ready to fall in love
I think a thug is ready to fall in love
I still think about the first time I saw you
Let me kush and booting you down, let me spoil you
I still think about the first time I saw you
Let me Louis you, Gucci you, damn, let me spoil you
I think a thug is ready to fall in love
I think a thug is ready to fall in love
I think a thug is ready to fall in love
I think a thug is ready to fall in love
