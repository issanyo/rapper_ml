We got that lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
My whole hood is tripping
My whole hood like Molly's
Strap in or jeans
My pants keep on falling
Got whooces on my [?]
Forces in my edgy
I pull in them pocalite
Them holding on one spin
Squash my mosh on
Just pop in
Totally watch it
[?].on that bitch
Decides on your nagging
Give a
Shitting nigga with a barbeque
Cuffing the younger bitches
Take her panties off
We got that lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
I put my fingertips in the back
I got that lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
Pouring liquor and forget homies
Then popping allies with these mad bitches
You know that strap I always keep it on me
In a steam ass for the stitches
I'm in that bang tube, the future
The loran, pull up, roll up
Those grow up in them hoes days
And showing them, he hoped
The [?] gone sleaze
Taking pussy like IDT
Catch a cold better ice in these
Full thing got shotgun
Keep going
Molly dolly
In the tease
Pussy showed up in it
Air so thick
You would think you wasn't in it
Got a tyro in her
That girl is on fire
Slip her off her tang
Her ass I admire
I got that lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
That lean and Molly's
