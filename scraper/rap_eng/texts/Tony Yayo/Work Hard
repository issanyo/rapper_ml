[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
You ain't gon get the money just blocking
You do it well but hatings no job
Nigga for everything I got I had to work hard
You ain't gon make it here with no heart
You be leakin here for nothin' nigga
You'll never be somebody just waiting
Being too patience won't leave no mark
Nigga for everything I got I had to work hard
You ain't gon make it here with no heart
I be leaving here with somethin' nigga

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
You clocking short with all that hate in your blood
You fucking leech throwing your weight around
Just looking for places to sink your teeth
Under my feet a million niggas the same
You peek beneath sending them threats behind doors
But up close you're speaking peace
None of them niggas have belief in a nigga before success
Holding your pride to come along for the ride, now walk the rest
All of the things that to be consistent with, rather ease off the stress
This is the shit I'm supposed to kick it with nah, feet on they necks
Niggas don't wanna put the work in rather eat off the vets
Try to erase what I worked hard for had to keep all connects
What's next? Street kept it realer huh
Motherfucking liar, perfectionistic grimy nature angel took us out the sky
Crazy how niggas turned their back on me
I got the millie though
Just adds to my material, sticks on the ground in your video
They laughing everywhere the face of a clown in the city scopes
Story full of broken promises and silly hopes

[Hook]
You ain't gon get the money just blocking

You ain't gon make it here with no heart
You be leakin here for nothin' nigga
You'll never be somebody just waiting
Being too patience won't leave no mark
Nigga for everything I got I had to work hard
You ain't gon make it here with no heart
I be leaving here with somethin' nigga

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
We got them big poles that fold up
Just in case a nigga try to roll up
Walking up on my feet getting calluses
Sleeping in the trap on some cheap air mattresses
Rain sleet or snow I'm 134
Arguing with speedy cos I made a sale in the store
New years eve and champagne in the store
About 500 niggas by that project door
Reminiscing on them good days
When you could make 10Gs in one day
Lil homie went from the play pen to the state pen
Mandatory life sentence that's how his life end
My phone ring to the day I die nigga
My work fire nigga go hard nigga
We trap till the day that we die nigga
Hot pipe on my waist I'm a real nigga

[Hook]
You ain't gon get the money just blocking
You do it well but hatings no job
Nigga for everything I got I had to work hard
You ain't gon make it here with no heart
You be leaking here for nothin' nigga
You'll never be somebody just waiting
Being too patience won't leave no mark
Nigga for everything I got I had to work hard
You ain't gon make it here with no heart
I be leaving here with somethin' nigga

[Verse 3: Lloyd banks]
Spending your era faking rich
Fools mistook it for wealth
Hiding your weakness and critiquing, take a look at yourself
You speeding everywhere for nothing
Could have been where you want by now
But without attention you can't function
Won't nothing come without the hustling
Your fooling yourself to think your actions ain't coming with repercussions
Just a vulnerable to hell the neighborhood demons rushing
It's a'ight you get back up you tough right the ceiling toughens
You don made it this far bluffing, quit while you ahead
Won't be acknowledged for flashing a nigga dollars when you dead
I'ma shit on y'all til God let me on out of here, you dig?
Nigga told the world you'll never flip on me, you did
A disgrace to anything that's connected how could you live
Another reason now my heart left lost and found in the fridge
Do yourself a favor while you out wandering, find a bridge
And the niggas that take you in they already know what it is

[Hook]
You ain't gon get the money just blocking
You do it well but hatings no job
Nigga for everything I got I had to work hard
You ain't gon make it here with no heart
You be leaking here for nothin' nigga
You'll never be somebody just waiting
Being too patience won't leave no mark
Nigga for everything I got I had to work hard
You ain't gon' make it here with no heart
I be leaving here with somethin' nigga
