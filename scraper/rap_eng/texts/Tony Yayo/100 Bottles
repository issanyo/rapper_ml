[Intro]
Jahlil Beats, holla at me
If it's your birthday, get drunk in this bitch
And it's my birthday, I had too many drinks
Tell them send a hundred bottles
Tell them send a hundred bottles
Tell them send a hundred bottles
Tell them send a hundred bottles
Tell them send a hundred bottles

[Verse 1]
Low studios, Lord knows this is faith
Four C's on my neck, cut, color, clarity and carat weight
Move on, sees carrot cake
I'm blessed so the average nigga hate
I move five thousand grams different hoes on my Instagram
I'm off to distant land, it's the passport gang
Money ain't a thing six figure pinky ring
My eyes chinese I'm on point like Lin
And I ain't trying to hit the bing
I am trying to hit shorty off in the beam
And pass her off to the team (and pass her off to the team)

[Chorus]
Tell them send a hundred bottles
Tell them send a hundred bottles
Tell them send a hundred bottles
Tell them send a hundred bottles
Tell them send a hundred bottles
If it's your birthday, get drunk in this bitch
And it's my birthday, I had too many drinks
Tell them send a hundred bottles

[Verse 2]
Please I did Herm√®s in '06
Old swag I'm in Alex McQueen kicks
With a mean bitch my money is Illuminati
I sacrifice it for some millions and a Maserati
Swag Saks Fifth dot com
I let your boo drive the car, 200 for the foreign
In front the club like Motortrend PYT
I'm older in the Benz Mr.Cuffin' ten
We ain't loving them we ain't really loving them
Work in the Pyrex time to cook again
Lil B dance, but with 3 bricks
And south side in the trap and a cute bitch
She the bomb like a nuclear scientist
A hundred bottles like a UFO is in this bitch
But we spendin'' dough in this bitch
And we let it show in this bitch

[Chorus]
Tell them send a hundred bottles
Tell them send a hundred bottles
Tell them send a hundred bottles
Tell them send a hundred bottles
If it's your birthday, get drunk in this bitch
And it's my birthday, I had too many drinks
Tell them send a hundred bottles
Tell them send a hundred bottles
Tell them send a hundred bottles
Tell them send a hundred bottles
Tell them send a hundred bottles
If it's your birthday, get drunk in this bitch
And it's my birthday, I had too many drinks
Tell them send a hundred bottles
