[Intro: 50 Cent]
Can't believe this man
This fat nigga talkin' 'bout how he wanna fight
I'll fuck yo ass up Joe
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I started out with more than a dollar in the dream
Three and half grams and the pistol, naa I mean?
Ya'll niggas know me mane I don't give a fuck
From day one, a nigga just trynna come up
Rings around my table, cups never in the coaster
Trigger finger soaked, pistol never in the holster
Five hundred grams, then stars get to choppin'
.38 special with the grip get to poppin'
My lifestyle is impeccable, I haunt you niggas
Such a fat ass lie, now I'm on you nigga
You turn on your TV, you see me on the screen
You doze off, fat fuck, see me in your dreams
If I don't see you with the scope, I'm a see you with the beam
And when you see the yellow tape, you can see the crime scene
You can mark, see the spot, then you know what I mean
In the day or in the dark, I put that work in, B

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'm on it like that
Look like that
You made like that
Pussy fat nigga fucking with me
I roll with the strap
Sip on the yak
Watch your back
Pussy boy really fucking with me

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Louis Cotton can't stand a stand up nigga
You gettin' money, get your hands up nigga
Go figure
Figure out a way to get yo home
They swagger dagger so I switch cologne
Use a different tone or get hit with chrome
You ain't touchin' me, no way Jose homes
Throw shots you gon' pay for em
Name banks, the PLK
And my BI, the DL way
Go play

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
Rap is like wrestin', everything is fake
But it's a good pussy-getter and the cash is great
The rap game, the grim reaper Koya
Lil' niggas like Game think they The Ultimate Warrior
Fat niggas like Joe think they Andre The Giant
I put my ruger in his face, his fat ass will be quiet
Jay-Z, one dollar man, that is Nas virtue
Nigga drop me out the show with my goons and murk you
PRRRATT

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Young Buck]
Charlie got a string on it
Gage got a beam on it
Niggas tell me he don't want it
I'm a hit him up anyway ok-k
Til wanna meet with my essays
Burritos and kilos, I get it back the next day
Buck - he gon' rap a nigga wife tonight
Anything is possible if the price is right
She want the nigga to own that big home you rentin'
Hope the nigga get the lil' money you gettin'
Muthafucka
