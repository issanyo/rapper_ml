Some niggas lie like they money long
But you can look at me and see hey
That I can make it snow in the summer baby
And I can make it rain when it’s sunny lady

(Verse)
I need that money, money
I get that money, money
To your head to toe
Got these girls money hungry
I got a s w a g degree, I pop the tag so gradually
Another day, another dollar
My bed sheet Prada
I lay on the shit feel like a million dolla’
Shawty says she swallow, I can’t believe this shit
She on my dick cuddle so artistic

(Hook)
Some niggas lie like they money long
But you can look at me and see hey

Cause I can make it snow in the summer baby
And I can make it rain when it’s sunny lady

(Verse)
Yeah, it’s winter time baby so we pull them temps out
The flop of a vest that will leave your limbs out
I grab the keys, pull up foreign with the rims out
It’s sweeter than them so I show you what a pimp bout
Hopping out designer shoes and designer clothes
Draped in designers jewels with designer hoes
You see my finna' JQ where my girl is smooth

Move around before we put you on a payroll bitch
It’s bud b, keeping it p with Tony Yayo bitch!

(Hook)

Make it snow when it’s 84 I ain’t playing
They call me weather man cause I got that cheddar maine
But ain’t no lie, I feed them bitches pocket change
You can start a thang, less you a pussy or brain
Let me be your pimping manager, same thang

Just cause thug got it don’t mean I gotta give it

(Hook)
Some niggas lie like they money long
But you can look at me and see hey
