[Intro: 50 Cent]
Disrespectful
And to think, I let you breathe
Now you're dead

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
There's no war without casualties
End up in a wake when you fuck with me
You got beef with my man you got beef with me
I got the semi on me motherfucker you'll see
Death around the corner

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Is that my dawg, that slapped that cat?
Now how did the chicken give birth to a rat?
Now how did the rat learn to sing like a bird?
His pops is a O.G., this is absurd
My gun game right, my knife game right
Fuck around I'll get right, in broad daylight
Spin the barrel on a nigga, pin the tail on the donkey
It's a zoo out this bitch, I put a hole in the monkey
Got the Gemstars to rip 'em, hundred shots to clip 'em
Body bags they zip 'em, and we don't know a thang
You hit nigga you trippin', you think it's over you trippin'
Reload slap the clip in, bang, bang, bang

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
There's no war without casualties
End up in a wake when you fuck with me
You got beef with my man you got beef with me
I got the semi on me motherfucker you'll see
Death around the corner

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Uhh, I drink like a uncle, smoke like a rasta
Ball like a superstar, talk like a boxer
Fuck like a rabbit, shit like a dinosaur
See like a sniper, lil' nigga ev'ry night is war
Ride like a Lambo', stunt like I'm out of town
Strapped like Commando, B-A-N-K-dollar sign
Give everything up I won't, change like the others, nope
Switch overnight I can't, I'm outside his camp
I'm 'bout a dollar boy and dollar bills'll kill
Kill that bullshit, I'm famous but I'm ridin' with the steel
Will throw it all away, I see you later today
You'll see 'em fadin' away, that's all I'm able to say

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
There's no war without casualties
End up in a wake when you fuck with me
You got beef with my man you got beef with me
I got the semi on me motherfucker you'll see
Death around the corner

[Break: Tony Yayo]
Yeah, it's the enforcer Yayo
We could do it in broad daylight
In front of the White House for all I care

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
I blow your heart out your body sucka
Then jump in the Aston blastin', burnin' rubber
Black ski mask, the Aston tinted
Ditch the gun, burn the car cause my DNA in it
Next day it's the GT, stunt off of G.P
Fist full of stones, fingers glowin' like E.T
Fake O.G., O.G. Bobby Jones
Do your son like J-Rock, Mausberg pumpin'
I'm stuntin', focused like a digital camera
Got that P-95 with that invisible hammer
Nigga who you tryin to ride on? I'm a icon
Heart made of steel, balls made of ir-on

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
There's no war without casualties
End up in a wake when you fuck with me
You got beef with my man you got beef with me
I got the semi on me motherfucker you'll see
Death around the corner

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Death around the corner, corner
