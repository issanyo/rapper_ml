[Chorus:]
Can't trust my friends, can't trust my enemies
Can't trust these hoes, I can't trust this industry
Everybody out to get me but
It's mo money mo problems
It's mo money mo problems
It's mo money mo problems
It's mo money mo problems

[Verse:]
Yea
The Unit ain't been the same
But I'm a hold this shit, down the streets screamin' my name
I got so cool beef with you know who
I just bought 30 swammies to supply the crew
This weed got me paranoid, you feel it in the air
If I get too paranoid, I shoot the engineer
Yea, I'm flyin in a Lear from Estonia
I got the sniper money I just spent a home on ya
When it's time to ride, there's a Hum (mer) full of niggas
When it's time for a show, there's a Bent (ley) full of niggas
Snake ass niggas is reptiles
Till I shoot em up fill em up with projectiles
Stay focused, these faggots in European cars
Only thing European is the wood on the Rolls
Hudred EX with the suicide doors
My car give you a hug to strike a pose

[Chorus]
