[Tony Yayo:]
I need a gangsta bitch
Cause I'm a gangsta nigga

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
Some days I'm happy and some I'm not
You was there for me baby when I was on lock
And them 8 hour trips really meant alot
You even called MCI when the phone was blocked
Listen ma, I ain't tryin' to be ya baby father
I'll be there when you need me ya knight in shining armor
Sippin' Malibu loungin' in the Malibu Mountains
Now we livin' straight no more Section 8 Housing
Its just me and my bitch you know like Big said
Take me to exctasy lovin' in the bed
Do you love me or love that I'm rappin?
Nah she like that white gold, rose gold, pink gold and platinum

[Chorus: Olivia]
Oh I'll do anything for you
I'll do anything that you want me to
Cause i'm your gangsta boo
Yeeeeesss I'll take a Greyhound trip for you
Carry that work across town in a day or two
Cause i'm your gangsta who'll do anything for you

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
My uptown mami she materialistic
My BK shorty down to hold the biscuit
My Qu shorty she one of a kind
So if you ain't got game don't waste your time
My down south bitch she keep it crunk
And my bitch in Cali man she love them blunts
When it comes to sex baby the kid can last
I stay real real hard like the calculus glass
Ma my hands up your shirt girl feelin' on your panties
Fingers all sticky off that pink cotton candy
Sexin' on the beach where its hot and sandy
Apple martinis out in Miami

[Chorus: Olivia]
Oh I'll do anything for you
I'll do anything that you want me to
Cause i'm your gangsta boo
Yeeeeesss I'll take a Greyhound trip for you
Carry that work across town in a day or two
Cause i'm your gangsta that'll do anything for you

[Tony Yayo: Singing]
We had our share of troubles
Many more than others
With a little love and understanding
We can fly high than any mountain

Ha ha I'm just playing

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
What make you a good girl with Gucci on your feet
Livin' in the club and hangin' in the street
Keeki a dime she straight from uptown
She move like Mimi's girls in the Pussy Pound
And Hera
I met her in Lord And Taylor
By Clinique and Mac
Baby got back
Whats up with that?
Don Perigon
The boots from Batetto Vennetto cost a arm

[Chorus: Olivia]
Oh I'll do anything for you
I'll do anything that you want me to
Cause i'm your gangsta boo
Yeeeeesss I'll take a Greyhound trip for you
Carry that work across town in a day or two
Cause i'm your gangsta who'll do anything for you

[Olivia:]
Gangsta boo
