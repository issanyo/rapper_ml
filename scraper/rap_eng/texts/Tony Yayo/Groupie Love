[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, G-Unit, ha hah

[Bridge: 50 Cent & Butch Cassidy]
I've been so many places
I've seen so many faces
Girl you look like someone that I done fucked before (ha ha)
I've been around the world
I've met all kind of girls
Girl you look like someone that I done fucked on tour
All sold out - getting paper things change (I'm rich, bitch)
You done heard of my name (50 Cent, bitch)
I'm a P.I.M.P. (I'm a pimp, bitch)
You done heard about me ('cause I'm the shit!)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You see how things change
First they didn't want me, now they want me
See a nigga gettin' paid, they wanna push up on me
You should see these hoes, chasing a nigga
I'll have 'em in the hotel, tasting a nigga
50 like a lollipop, lick me baby
Then lick Dr. Dre and Shady -- ohh!

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy & 50 Cent]
Groupie love, they gimme gimme gimme that groupie love
They gimme gimme gimme that groupie love
When you see me in V.I.P., with hoes around me
Man they give me that groupie love
Come gimme gimme gimme that groupie love
Come gimme gimme gimme that groupie love
Tonight you wanna fuck with me
It's alright with me, c'mon and gimme that groupie love

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
That's the reason these groupies is on my dick
Listen young and old, these hoes is loose
Wintertime's the staircase, summertime's the roof
Gimme eight days and a eighth, homie I'm straight
Have a church girl on the bus movin' weight
I got birds backstage that's serious eye-candy
Ain't got birds in the hood so I'm in the burbs with Bambi
My writin' methods, got me more hoes than Tyson Beckford
Icy necklace on the tour bus, ass naked
When I say jump, bitch say "how high?"
And flag down a car when the shit drive by
I'm a pimp like Pretty Tone
I got the info on the pretty chrome
Fuckin' hoes off of 50 phone
My name hold weight, you barely known
You on that R. Kelly shit, your bitch is barely grown (YEAH!)

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy & 50 Cent]
Groupie love, they gimme gimme gimme that groupie love
They gimme gimme gimme that groupie love
When you see me in V.I.P., with hoes around me
Man they give me that groupie love
Come gimme gimme gimme that groupie love
Come gimme gimme gimme that groupie love
Tonight you wanna fuck with me
It's alright with me, c'mon and gimme that groupie love

[Break: 50 Cent]
G-G-G-G-G, G-G-G-G-G, G-Unit! (Ha ha!)

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Shorty ain't feelin' me, shorty must like girls..
.. like girls, 'cause I'm the only man in your world
Bitch I can make you famous, you don't know what you're missin'
I can change your mind if you listen
The bitch don't like me, the bitch must don't like men..
.. like men, I say what I want cause I can
If I didn't I'd be a liar, mami I'm on fire
Come ride with a rider, I travel
So you might catch the King with a singer
But touching my doorbell's the only way I put a ring on your finger
Threw me a combo with two cups and
I'm in your bedroom fuckin' up your sheets like the Klu Klux Klan
I shook hands with my fans then fuck 'em
I'm in the hallways tryin' to duck 'em, so I can climb in sum'n
My name's B-A-N-K dollar sign BITCH
I'm a pimp, you need to make that switch
And come and give me that

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy & 50 Cent]
Groupie love, they gimme gimme gimme that groupie love
They gimme gimme gimme that groupie love
When you see me in V.I.P., with hoes around me
Man they give me that groupie love
Come gimme gimme gimme that groupie love
Come gimme gimme gimme that groupie love
Tonight you wanna fuck with me
It's alright with me, c'mon and gimme that groupie love

[Outro: Butch Cassidy]
Groupies come and groupies go
And they are always at our show
So I grab me the tightest one and pursed straight to the mall
She's so excited that she's here with me that she feels she should pay her fee
And I did not disagree so she dropped down to her knees
Groupie love, yeah
Groupie love, yeah
Groupie love, yeah
Groupie love, yeah
