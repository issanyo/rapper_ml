Shit was all good just a week ago
Two bodys in that trap, I heard that bitch ... could know

Rufus killers 'ain't here for your soul

You know that strap old man
Go- good die young, die young, die young
They say they could die young
They could die young, die young
They say they could die young
Rest in peace the ...was here for ..
Couldn't shoot his body up and left his ...
'ain't no telling by tomorow with that fancy life, trap life, traps get ...
In this beef you'll bring that .. back
Sure the seventeen got his .. out of snap bag
Another statistic to the cold street
Hard way to have what we fallow
And when we finelly get it you know we gonna tost it up
Blue ..., blue dream you know we gona smoked it up
I see you ..., i wish I can take back the fact that lonely ...
And I 'ain't come to your funeral, 'ain't come to see you

Right after, hight after, I kill just for you
Die young, die young, they say thay god die young
Good die young, die young
