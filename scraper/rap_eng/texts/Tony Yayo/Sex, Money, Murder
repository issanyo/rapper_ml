[Intro: Tony Yayo]
Yeah, 2015, nigga
New year, new money, nigga, new money, nigga

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
Most of these niggas just around for the perks
Fuck it, let 'em eat like Meechi
Money, pussy, power and work
When I die, bury me with my phone, nigga
'Cause I ain't leavin' clientele for these ho-niggas
Industry today ain't about winnin' or losin'
It's 'bout makin' statements
Send my little nigga, Sly, through the AK shit
I own in a while like Seymour (-)
Re-up quick, see more work
Yeah, I'm like a hippie in a past life
Me and my Crippy still high from last night
'Cause I'm a self-made gangsta
And you a self-centered wanksta

[Hook: Thirst Mulah]
Ha, comin' to the wrong town
Pussy, pussy-nigga got shot
Long money, fuckin' none about
You be dead on the block

All I know is money, sex and money, murder
All I know is money, sex and money, murder
All I know is money, sex and money, murder
You be dead on the block

[Verse 2: Thirst Mulah]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, mama tried to warn me
I was 'ddicted to the street life
Mama used to scorn me
Never in the fuckin' house, but so are street lights
Woo, red bandana-reppin'
Move around the town, man, Mel Gibson with the weapon
Diddy-boppin', got my cruise on when I'm steppin'
Nigga had to die, fuck it, hit him with the Wesson
I'm a get this money, motherfucker, I'm a ride out
Most these niggas frontin'
Leave 'em wet and get 'em dried out
Movin' and shootin', nigga, the battleground
Everythin' you seein', better back it up
.45th on my waist, had to back 'em up
Click-class, then I throw 'em in the Caddy trunk
Move around the town, homie, like got shit to prove
I ain't got no life, I ain't got shit to lose

[Hook: Thirst Mulah]

[Verse 3: Sose]
My nigga, y'all want a four-door, 'scule vision
I ain't even lookin' through a full scope
You trippin', nigga think his life is a baggage claim
Strap a fuckin' bomb to a passenger, now it's half a plane
Your destination was final
Your camp was never concentrated on the lyrics
So was death on a rival
Athena means that I'm Theano, blood embedded with tribal
Native who made it to save the day, a reign's like a cycle
A page out the Bible, break it like a paper with typos
I plead insanity, you know that I'm the range on our rifles
I'm all Michaels, Michael Myers, Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' in your bitch
Now she chiropractin', drive her legs in
It's so fortunate I'm scorchin' shit
It's apparent you're embarrassed
When I take off with your audience
Accordin' to the papers
And the statements you was caught up in
You faker than Jamaicans in Half-Baked
There's somethin' wrong with 'em

[Hook: Thirst Mulah]
