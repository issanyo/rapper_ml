[Verse 1]
Better take care
Think I better go, better get a room
Better take care of me
Again and again
I think about this and I think about personal history
Better take care
I breathe so deep when the movie gets real
When the star turns round
Again and again
He looks me in the eye says he's got his mind on a countdown
3-2-1

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Forever
I'm screaming that I'm gonna be living on till the end of time
Forever
The sky splits open to a dull red skull
My head hangs low cause it's all over now

[Chorus 1]
And there's never going to be enough money
And there's never going to be enough drugs
And I'm never ever going to get old
There's never going to be enough bullets
There's never going to be enough sex
And I'm never ever going to get old
So I'm never ever going to get high
And I'm never ever going to get low
And I'm never ever going to get old

[Verse 2]
Better take care
The moon flows on to the edges of the world because of you
Again and again
And I'm awake in an age of light living it because of you
Better take care
I'm looking at the future solid as a rock because of you
Again and again
Want to be here and I wanna be there
Living just like you, living just like me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Forever
Putting on my gloves and bury my bones in the marshland
Forever
Think about my soul but I don't need a thing just the ring of the bell in the pure clean air

[Chorus]
And I'm running down the street of life
And I'm never going to let you die
And I'm never ever going to get old
And I'm never ever going to get
I'm never ever going to get
I'm never ever going to get old
And I'm never ever going to get
I'm never ever going to get
And I'm never ever going to get old
I'm never ever going to get
Never ever get old
