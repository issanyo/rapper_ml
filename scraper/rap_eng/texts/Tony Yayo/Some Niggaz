[Hook] (x2)
Some niggas Blood and some niggas Crip
Some niggas thugs and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas ain't got nothin', some niggas rich
Some niggas die frontin' and some livin' in shit

[Verse 1]
I'm like the movie that (-) ain't want you to watch
Drug dealer nigga, look at the watch
I'm like a mother's smile on a spring day
'Til a nigga pull out that long AK
And rain down on you niggas
Shooters run down on you niggas
They gun down on you niggas
In the darkness like Johnny Depp in the pro
Wary of them jail clothes
Listenin' in to everything that we know
A lot of niggas dropped they fladge when the feds come
Bad bitches givin' head when that bread come
I know some Blood niggas drink a red rum
And some Crip killers in Brooklyn out 'Smurf Village'
Marble floors don't rattle
Suicide doors on the Enzo
No clubbin', we all re-in' up
Primal aggression on the first of the month
The beef turn to black house
Infrared, got him, another mother lose her towel
My own cameras catch me snatchin' up the cig
Now I'm caught up like Aaron Hernandez
Life on my back, NFL-big
My dope a eight, points to Bell Biv
Marker than the icon, stay in (-)
Medusa look at my wrist, turn it into stone
Bought my first Uzi in highschool, got a name
Back then, played saloojee with niggas' 'chines

[Interlude]
Yo, hand me that strap, man
Summertime, we kill all these niggas, man
Killers are quick, machine gun raps, nigga
Kill these niggas, man, hot outside

[Verse 2]
Y'all like Milli Vanilli, I should lip-sync battle
Forges on twenty-fours, lip sink on the Tahoe
I'm too gangsta for the Grammys
And too real for the red carpet
Buyin' straps and rally in the supermarket
And I ain't payin' no rent, super on some dog shit
Challenger Hellcat, seven hundred horses
Pull up to the club, seven hundred Porsches
Politic with lawyers on gold courses
Eight-paved forty-eight got my mind in orbit
We refuse to forfeit, we beat life challenges
Even though we came up on mayonnaise sandwiches

[Hook] (x2)
Some niggas Blood and some niggas Crip
Some niggas thugs and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas ain't got nothin', some niggas rich
Some niggas die frontin' and some livin' in shit
