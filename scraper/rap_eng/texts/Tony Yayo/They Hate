Interscope paided on the T.O.S. Project
I still got money Jimmy, cash ain't no object
I'm drunk homie that's the patron talking
And the fathom goes riding with the doors open
My man a killa he's fresh from up north
But switch the swag up tight clothes and Mohawks
You know the streets talk
And how the hood do
Follow hood rules
Or niggas might kill you
Bloods and Crips cursing to their kids
They're "blood stains" in the projects there's nothing but blood stains
Pain, poverty, fear, hate
I use to sale crack sitting on a milk cate
It don't kill it make me stronger
Stay hated, we can rolling the marijuana
They hate
They hate
They hate
They constantly hate me
They don't kill, it makes me stronger
They don't kill, it makes me stronger
They hate
They hate
They hate
They constantly hate me
They don't kill, it makes me stronger
They don't kill, it makes me stronger
They hate
They hate
They hate
They constantly hate me
