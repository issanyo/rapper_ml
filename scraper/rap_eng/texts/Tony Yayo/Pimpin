[Intro/Hook: Tony Yayo]
I don't, love, hoes - I'm sharin them
I ain't lovin them, or handcuffin them - cause baby I'm pimpin
You, love, hoes - you chasin them
You be lacin them, while I'm replacin them - cause baby I'm pimpin

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
I lay my pimp game down when it comes to these bitches
They do what I say and obey all my wishes
Wash all my clothes and clean dirty dishes
I turn a sweet bitch to a switchblade sister
While you shop on Melrose, buyin hoes shoes
I'm in Mickey D's buyin #2's
Now get yo' ass on the track and get the dough for me
I'm the #1 pimp, so she chosen me
And my hoes where the ballers and bros be
They collect them G's and they give 'em to me
I'm pimpin, no perm, just gators
Pimpin, show you how to stunt on them haters
Pimpin, flossin in that new Cadillac
Pimpin, chinchil' with the fur hat
Pimpin, I show you how to school a ho
And when you chasin them bitches I'm chasin the dough (YEAH!)

[Hook: Tony Yayo]
I don't, love, hoes - I'm sharin them
I ain't lovin them, or handcuffin them - cause baby I'm pimpin
You, love, hoes - you chasin them

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
Freakin, I ain't speakin, girl I ain'tcha hubby
Ma back that thing up, girl time is money
You ain't freakin I ain't speakin girl I ain't no dummy
And we can play the Marriott, ball, pop some bubbly
That said if 50 can't get none, I ain't speakin
Girl I ain't speakin, girl I ain't speakin
I said if Banks can't get none, I ain't speakin
Girl I ain't speakin, girl I ain't speakin
Yeah Lisa and Kim, they "Straight Outta Ca$hville"
I met 'em with Buck, in his mansion in Nashville
My bitch from the D used to live on Marshall block
I put a foot to her ass like, martial arts
I got a stable of hoes in the, C-P-T
Ask my nigga Snoop and the, D-R-E
Girl fix your lipstick, your hair is a mess
And I know your feet hurt in them damn Payless
