[Verse 1:]
My mic is like transparent poison
Drop top phantom with them hoes in
See I'm lookin and I'm smellin like making millions
Got the god seein paper filled with tabor filling
And when the sours in the system
Ain't no tellin if I fuck em or I diss em I'm a pimp by tradition
Gettin head in the bentley on the way home
Still making power moves on the cell phone
Cesars palace dropping them big bets
More chips than the chipmunks and chippettes
New lex that park itself
When you telling war stories don't mark yourself

[Chorus: x2]
Respect violence you a wolf or a sheep
You a come up real niggas wanna eat
A vegetarian you ain't got beef
If you shoot horror movies in the streets

[Verse 2:]
Yea
Louie houserobe, hermeez slips
Cause the strip on lockshaw, michael vick
And if the feds flip, you know I got that case money
In the club it's rozay by the case homie
Ak 47 wake up the dead
Fuck a kingpin charge nigga duck the feds
My skin made outta gingerbread
Your bitch pullin on me like a cigarette
20 rozays in an icebowl
Confetti fallin out the sky like the rose bowl
I'm in my old school, with them flip flop colors
Bumpin biggie smallz for them hip hop lovers

[Chorus x2]
