[Soulja Boy]
I’m a superstar bitch get your telescope
All eyes on me like a microscope
Me and Yayo doing shit that you ain’t never seen
I’m flipping through you weak bitches like a magazine
And girl jumpin on my dick like a trampoline
Each instrumental it’s a different murder scene
19 living all my motherf-cking dreams
I can get a hundred thousand in these Gucci jeans
If you left the game they wouldn’t miss him
I kicked in the door f-cked up the whole system
Couldn’t explain how this shit feel
I’m real important like a hundred dollar bill
Everybody want me, yeah they want a piece of me
Attack all you want man there ain’t no defeatin’ thee
S.O.D terror yeah it’s new era
Boss money (?) shouts outs New Era
Nigga I’m good for ya like a vitamin
250 G’s just to make my tire spin
SOD bitch my chain look like lightening
Hoes at my party but we didn’t invite the bitch

[Tony Yayo - Chorus]
Street manuscript, cocaine analyst
King of the pyrex I whip it up and I hit a lick
I whip the pyrex then I hit the lick
I whip the pyrex then I hit a lick
I am chef I can show you how to split a brick
I whip it up then I hit a lick
Rockerfella law, cut a lot a time
I keep my head above water New York State of mind
I get shot for the shines like Waka Flocka
The (?) and the fiends are flocking
We got that Bobby and Whitney
Throw you a price and you hit me
I throw that bitch on a scale in a jiffy
But don’t miss me
More money more power that’s the motto
That’s why the US assassinated Pablo
I read palms and the Bible
They tell me pray for my haters but I really find it hard to
Designers drugs, designers clothes, my whole neck froze
We Steve Nash hoes
S.O.D G-Unit we G’d up
Move 10 bricks now it’s time to re-up
I move around with the Nina
With a bad bitch with an ass like Trina
New York State of Mind like Billy Joel
I Godfather the blunt the whole philly swoll
All my cars are clean, the new and O(?)
I’m fresh in the town connected with my Kin folk (thats my cousin)
Bitches talking bout a nigga like Miss Info
I’m in the kitchen water whipping getting more dough
Me and Soulja riding round in the Lambo
We getting money so we ain’t cuffing no hoe

[Chorus]
