[Lil B]
Statistics say I ain't gon' live to see past thirty
Things on my mind, a few seen a coffin early
Internet like trash; human race is dirty
Ask me if I give a fuck about a life sentence
Most rappers use their quote as they life sentence
Now the judge give them time plus the five digits
Could have been the next doctor, anything proper
Most people love war, and they hate the scores
At the top of the game, and the plate is yours
In the water, and I'm Jaws
Internet claws, plus I'm banned like Tiger Balm
Long live the King
Pause

[Tony Yayo]
Vegative state, banana clip a nigga
Movie; he wake up twenty years later
Envious cause every man got insecurities
PS90, blue nose for security
Rest in peace to Oscar Grant, 'bout his biz
Cops shot him in cold blood, got two years
BP finally capped up that oil spill
Tea Party sayin' "Fuck Obama's health bill"
Madoff in the Feds and he still livin'
Front page of the Post, four billion hittin'
They say man is destroyin' the earth crust
Haiti got money and food that they can't touch
My kids growin' up, hope they have the right future
They don't play outside, they slaves to computers
Everybody shooters
Straps get purchased, let off the pound
The trembling sound; the ground's nervous
The ground's nervous
