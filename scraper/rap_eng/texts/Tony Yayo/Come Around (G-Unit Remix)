It's Buck Marley, yo roll this up for me
I came on a Harley and left in a Ferrari
Lord have mercy, the ganja got mi thirsty
I gotta get me some of that Bermuda run ya heard me
I'm not just singing, I've walked through Kingston
You say you're from the ghetto, well that's the real meaning
I brought it with me, cmon and party with me
My top [?] with me in case they try to get me
Can't even see it's too cloudy my eyes bloodshot
I need more fire cmon with the bloodclot
Ponder it now baby, badman go crazy
Weedman go love me, police man go hate me

Waiting on my day to come so I can blow a Babylon
Go head and have your song

The high grade when me a look for

Ever since the herbs slow down

And when it come to war they spray them them cannons
They got them max cars them text me jammin
