[Intro]
(I've been looking, I've been looking)[x2]

[Verse]
I've been looking
For a woman
To save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with a feeling
Of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be
Be tomorrow
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
A woman with a feeling
Of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be
Be tomorrow

[Outro]
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now[x4]
