[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
Ma is that your man, fiance, trick or baby daddy
Husband, best friend or ya sugar daddy
We could cruise in the navvy, or cruise in the Caddy
I'll tongue lick you toes girl, I know you like it nasty
Creep to ya condo, you know my waist heavy
Picture me being stuck in the closet like R. Kelly
That ain't likely, I know that you like me
Just keep me on the low, you can still be his wifey, come on

[Verse 2: Joe]
Hey mami, look like you arrested with his handcuff and
He be talking louder, he ain't saying nothing
If that's how he do you
If that's what your used to, I'm telling you that you need to move

[Hook: Joe]
The party's over here (you need to move)
I can make him disappear (you need to move)
Let's stop wasting time and let's get down to riding
Girl I promise you gone see

[Chorus: Joe] (2x)
I know you got a man, but he ain't nothin like me
He might put it down, but he can't put it like me
My hood thing, my wood thing, my paper man
You gone like, you gone like, cause he ain't nothin like me

[Verse 3: Joe]
Hey honey, you be on restriction with his short money
It's cloudy over there, but here it's so sunny
If that's how he do you
If that's what your used to, I'm telling you that you need to move

[Hook: Joe]
The party's over here (you need to move)
I can make him disappear (you need to move)
Let's stop wasting time and let's just get to grinding
Girl I promise you gone see oh

[Chorus: Joe] (2x)
I know you got a man, but he ain't nothin like me
He might put it down, but he can't put it like me
My hood thing, my wood thing, my paper man
You gone like, you gone like, cause he ain't nothin like me

[Verse 4: Young Buck]
She said she like me, but she hate I got these thuggish ways
I tried to work a nine to five, but it doesn't pay
We met the other day, seen you and hollered hey
Where you from, what's your phone number, where you stay?
Come let me sit you in this Bentley on these heated seats
Sip up some crystal, let you ride and see the beach
I know you probably got a man but give me a chance
I guarantee you he can't do it baby like I can
Yeah

[Chorus: Joe] (2x)
I know you got a man, but he ain't nothin like me
He might put it down, but he can't put it like me
My hood thing, my wood thing, my paper man
You gone like, you gone like, cause he ain't nothin like me
