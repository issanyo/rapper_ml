[Eminem]
Here we go again

[50 Cent]
Does it make you mad when I switch my flow
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent, I'm on fire cause Shady said so
I'm on Fire

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Everybody's in a rush try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
I ain't trying to use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even trying to go there with record sales
I'm just trying to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what up, keep stepping, and just rep D12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And living reckless
But if you go check my belt
You may see something else I used to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja must have lost his mind
That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to 'Pac now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael
Just keep singin' the same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and Hailie dance to your songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
C'mon now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I hurt your pride dawg and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, with syllable after syllable I just slap you
Killin' you fasta than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of that shit you on
But if you want it you got it you'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads wit any motherfucker that wants to
So whats the, deal where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, Ja what up dawg?
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there wit all your men, we coulda solved this then
I'mma grown man dawg come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow
Another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be come on

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I know you don't want it with me, you know you don't want it with me
You, talk an', soon you gon' see, you don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me, tou, talk an' you soon you will see
You know you don't want it with me

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you
Ja you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol
I clap at your ass with this chrome 38
And put six thru your hats, a seven and 3/8's
Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you should shook night
I put my knife in ya wind pipe and breeze through the turnpike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got robbed two times so ya ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with Steven Segal, bitch

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I know you don't want it with me, you know you don't want it with me
You, talk an', soon you gon' see, you don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me, tou, talk an' you soon you will see
You know you don't want it with me

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Fuck that, I'm miles away
And these industry niggas startin' to get outta hand
Like I won't find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out ya man
We killin' New York, even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate up out your van and
They see me pop a boy for icey cause I could
But you been gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood (hood)
Cause when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
How you want it wit' us, half of your artists got make-up on
Every magazine I own your on your knees takin' prayer pictures
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nothin' about what pain is sucka
I'll put your ass underground like a train conductor, muh'fucker

[Hook: 50 Cent] 2X
I know you don't want it with me, you know you don't want it with me
You, talk an', soon you gon' see, you don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me, tou, talk an' you soon you will see
You know you don't want it with me
