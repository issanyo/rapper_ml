[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I've been grinding my whole life, nigga
Fuck you talking 'bout?
I'm talking about eating, pushing that white, nigga
You know what I'm about
Front with my shit better come correct, nigga
Fuck you talking 'bout?
Talking about hitting a nigga with this TEC, nigga
Yeah, you know what I'm talking 'bout

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I've been unwrapping them bricks, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Bagging up pounds of kush with your bitch, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Stashing these pills, hoping they fit, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Don't worry about me and the Unit, we the shit, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I got million dollar schemes on my mind, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Them Cuban on, touch a link and shots flyin', nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
I'm still fucking three ho's at one time, faded
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Put my motherfucking game on her, now her mind's x-rated
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
I got my status up grinding, made it from the bottom like you
Southside nigga to a month in Cancun
Huge rocks poking, I don't need an AC
Banks going through everything B-I two G's
These niggas rapping now stupid
Bragging, they ain't never sold a unit (One unit!)
Acting like you will never do it
Don't wind up on the wall over music

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I can get it, get it for you for the low
Six-fifty nigga for an O
Blink, a kilo is out the door
Don't fuck around when I'm hustling bo
Got a hundred mill in my stash, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Motherfuck that bank, I got it in cash, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Everything cool here 'til I trip, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Having niggas hit you, your cousin then your bitch, nigga

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I've been grinding my whole life, nigga
Fuck you talking 'bout?
I'm talking about eating, pushing that white, nigga
You know what I'm about
Front with my shit better come correct, nigga
Fuck you talking 'bout?
Talking about hitting a nigga with this TEC, nigga
Yeah, you know what I'm talking 'bout

[Bridge: Young Buck]
And I'm fresh out the pen back selling dope, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
50 said we ain't never going broke, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Just blew what your house cost on my neck, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Bitch better come find me she want a check, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
G-Unit, bitch

[Verse 4: Tony Yayo]
The bitch only yours in the bed, nigga
These hoes ain't loyal, want bread winners
Hit Perfection, throw bread, nigga
S550 getting head, nigga
European bitches crazy ass
With funny accents, Euros in my back
Trunk full of white boy, One Direction
On that I-9-5, Heckler for protection
One minute I'm home, next I'm in Rome, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Passport gang, my phone's on roam, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
G5 flight, I'm in my zone, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
While your bitch giving me dome, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I've been grinding my whole life, nigga
Fuck you talking 'bout?
I'm talking about eating, pushing that white, nigga
You know what I'm about
Front with my shit better come correct, nigga
Fuck you talking 'bout?
Talking about hitting a nigga with this TEC, nigga
Yeah, you know what I'm talking 'bout

[Bridge: Young Buck]
And I'm fresh out the pen back selling dope, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
50 said we ain't never going broke, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Just blew what your house cost on my neck, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Bitch better come find me she want a check, nigga
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
G-Unit, bitch

[Verse 5: Kidd Kidd]
Rock O's, but you ain't even know it
Big Roscoe, can't even hold it
This hot dough, but I ain't even sold it
Get your wig split, I ain't need to sew it
We ain't cool, nigga, yesterday paper, old news, nigga
Everything brand new, nigga
I've been shitting, check your bathroom, nigga
Big watch, I'm big time
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
My neck blink and my whip shine
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Stick it in the freezer 'til it get solid
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
All my life I've been grinding
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
9th Ward

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I've been grinding my whole life, nigga
Fuck you talking 'bout?
I'm talking about eating, pushing that white, nigga
You know what I'm about
Front with my shit better come correct, nigga
Fuck you talking 'bout?
Talking about hitting a nigga with this TEC, nigga
Yeah, you know what I'm talking 'bout

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Y'all niggas act like y'all don't know what I'm talking 'bout
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
You can fuck around if you want and get your ass laid out
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
This is the Unit
(Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
The mighty, mighty Unit
G-G-G-G-G-Unit
