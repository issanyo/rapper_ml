[Hook:]
She move away slow and melodic
She move her ass slow and melodic

She move away slow and melodic

[Verse 1:]
DC stadium this drunk chick got the major wing
Her ass keep on jiggleing
Her ass keep on wiggleing
Do body swag, pockets on arabian
7 stars the hotel the glow is where I'm stayin' in
All this money give a rich nigga paper cuts
Them hoes flock around when your paper up
She thick as fuck I'm rolling up
Meanest spray all in my cup
Got this club moving slow as fuck
Moving slow as fuck

[Hook:]
She move away slow and melodic
She move her ass slow and melodic
She move away slow and melodic
We mackin', we mackin' we we we mackin'
We mackin', we mackin' we we we mackin'
She move away slow and melodic
She move her ass slow and melodic
She move away slow and melodic
We mackin', we mackin' we we we mackin'
We mackin', we mackin' we we we mackin'

[Bridge:]
It's the strip club anthem
Bitch hop up on that fucking pole
And keep dancing, dancing
It's the strip club anthem
Bitch hop up on that fucking pole
And keep dancing, dancing
Keep dancing, keep dancing
Keep dancing, keep dancing

[Verse 2:]
We poppin' bottles like we won the chill
30 on lead it, 37 hundred bitch
That money chrome it's plastic ware
Down to singles I'm torching that
Jersey girls got crazy girls
You know the ones that rap as hell
On a scale from 1 to 10 this bitch is bad
Jump in Mercedes hitting that
Swipe so we hit the pad
Bitch wanna have my baby bad
I ain't keeping this, I'm mistreating it
My 3 baby mama must be on this shit
Tell the loose cockpit me in your bitch
Let's snuck in a big ship, me and my bitch
Me and my bitch, I mean me and your bitch
Counterfeit dipping out, broke your bitch
Stole your bitch, mole your bitch
My pimpin' got cold as shit

[Bridge:]
It's the strip club anthem
Bitch hop up on that fucking pole
And keep dancing, dancing
It's the strip club anthem
Bitch hop up on that fucking pole
And keep dancing, dancing
Keep dancing, keep dancing
Keep dancing, keep dancing

[Hook:]
She move away slow and melodic
She move her ass slow and melodic
She move away slow and melodic
We mackin', we mackin' we we we mackin'
We mackin', we mackin' we we we mackin'
She move away slow and melodic
She move her ass slow and melodic
She move away slow and melodic
We mackin', we mackin' we we we mackin'
We mackin', we mackin' we we we mackin'
