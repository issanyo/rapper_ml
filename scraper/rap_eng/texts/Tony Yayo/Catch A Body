I catch a body quick tonight, I catch a body quick tonight
I catch a body quick tonight, I catch a body quick tonight
I catch a body quick tonight, I catch a body quick tonight
I catch a body quick tonight, I catch a body quick tonight

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
I'm a r-i-d-e-r, run up on your car
You praying at a mess, you're taxing, you bitch
I've got to drop, I'll pop you, it's up
I jump in the coup√©, dope and a gun in the box
No remorse, big homie, I shoot, they fucking wake up
I'll know his lil' monkies when they get me for my Jacob
I'm talented, yes, I'm gifted
Got the fith, -, fuck Czar, fuck Terror Squad
No fighting, my trey pound do the job

[Hook: Tony Yayo] [Repeated]
I catch a body quick tonight, I catch a body quick tonight
I catch a body quick tonight, I catch a body quick tonight
I catch a body quick tonight, I catch a body quick tonight
I catch a body quick tonight, I catch a body quick tonight

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
Springtime's coming, summertime's coming
Got the whole shit to playing gods
Cause in J-u-n-e, the homies' don't play
The killer starts acting dog, acting dog
They squeeze in the daytime, squeeze in the night time
And they're just having fun, having fun
So don't come outside, we ride to ride
Motherfucker, better have your gun
It's the killer season, season in June and July
Shit's getting high, a lot of niggers' start to die
It's the killer season, season, OG's losing fame
Lil' homie's sixteen and he's got a big deal
It's the killer season, season

[Hook: Tony Yayo] [Repeated]
I catch a body quick tonight, I catch a body quick tonight
I catch a body quick tonight, I catch a body quick tonight
I catch a body quick tonight, I catch a body quick tonight
I catch a body quick tonight, I catch a body quick tonight
