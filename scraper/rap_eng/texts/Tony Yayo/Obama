[Verse 1]
I punish mikes like Frank Castle
We filet mignon, y'all White Castle
Four-ten cause I don't like to wrestle
My bitch a ten and she'll blast you
I use food stamps in the streets, yo
Now I got a cool ranch like Doritos
I'm spendin' euros, flashin' bankrolls
In the Louis store with a set of four
Real classy chick, good hygiene
You know what I mean, J Brand jean
Said if money ain't a thing, ice crystals in the ring
Boss, I could sneak a pistol in the bank
You a king, I'm Achilles, roll up the Phillies
I behead a nigga with the semi

[Hook] (x2)
I got that white, that Sammy Sosa
X pills, call 'em Lady Gaga
Dope bags and sniffed Obama
We gettin' money, gettin' money, yeah

[Verse 2]
Real niggas comin' home, wonder what they missin'
Drive by the strip, the hood disappearin'
First day home, Sean broke curfew
A repetitive criminal mind, it'll curse you
But fuck parole maltreatment
He headed out of town and he 'bout to sweet lick
Three bricks of that raw heroin
Him and money got a bond, take a risk, seen her dead
His PO call him, he say, 'Reporting'
Sean like, 'Fuck that, I'm balling'
It's three o'clock, time to make the dead drop
Fifty-five keys'll take him to the top
Fuck the DEA and FBI
He cookin' up meth with a white cutie pie

[Hook] (x2)

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Everybody up from 'round here, nigga
Ha-ha, uh-huh, 134, nigga
Niggas ask about me, nigga
