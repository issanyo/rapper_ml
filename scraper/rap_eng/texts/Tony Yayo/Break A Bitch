[Chorus: x2]
Pimping ain't easy for you
But pimping is easy for me
(I'll show you how to break a bitch!)
You're mad cause she ain't choose you
You're mad cause your bitch chose me
(I'll show you how to break a bitch!)

[Verse 1:]
Defend them? I call it cash with a friendly ghost
Smoking packy ya I'll damn to the Freddie Roach
Pimping ain't easy but it sure is fun
I put my hot dog in your hoe and she gave me the buns
I got a stable full of girls with the good nookie
I'm tryin' to hit a pot of gold Lady Gaga pussy
I'm soaking yellow of their lala
Thousand dollars shoes
Your bottom bitch go bye bye
Dead animals, chinchilla on closet wrappers
PEETA protests and try to spray my main jacket
Video vixens they all spoiled
You hit their pussy, they wanna fuck it in voice

[Chorus: x2]
Pimping ain't easy for you
But pimping is easy for me
(I'll show you how to break a bitch!)
You're mad cause she ain't choose you
You're mad cause your bitch chose me
(I'll show you how to break a bitch!)

[Verse 2:]
It ain't hard to figure out
How to take them panties off and dig her out
That's the easy part, just tell her run a nigga out
Pass her the game and stick it in her mouth!
Say what? tell all your friends, and you can't foc'
It wouldn't matter 'cause bitch I'm in the pimp mode
I take what I want, you can keep the rest
I got a lot of hoes, but you're the freakiest
And when I break a bitch I take a shit
You like the pumpkin kissing niggas, faking it!
I'm like the say hoe, it's Short Dog and Yayo
Hard on the bitch, but they know!

[Chorus: x2]
Pimping ain't easy for you
But pimping is easy for me
(I'll show you how to break a bitch!)
You're mad cause she ain't choose you
You're mad cause your bitch chose me
(I'll show you how to break a bitch!)
