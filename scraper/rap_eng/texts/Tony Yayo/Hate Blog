I mix the kush up with the Hindu
And mon freaky spreaks like Chris angel
I gotta mean back stroke like Michael Phelps
Karate kangaroos match the big h on the belt
I ball like chris ball, I drink the crystal
I love hoodrats and vicky models
I'm in hot wheels ya know fast cars
Y'all are renters, those are not yours
Nigga I floss the dope and the crack man
I'm tryna burn 68 mill like the joker did in batman
Grey and black louie demands I'm straight thuggin it
My flows like Mickie d's nigga they loving it
Ba ba ba ba ba, I'm in a spaceship
Strawberry cough you would think I'm smoking laced shit
Look at the bracelt, vvs stones bitch
I got swag, I don't mean to brag
And if I need to know the price then I won't pop the tag
Nigga, I'm in a drop jag, paper tag, black mag, black mask
I put you in a body bag
You an r.n I'm extrordinary
Niggas don't know me cause they ordinary
I'm unordinary, I'm unorthadox
My ak I'l put big foot in a box

[Chorus:]
Drop a bag then it's off with his head
Drop a bag then it's off with his head
Drop a bag then it's off with his head
Drop a bag then it's off with his head
Drop a bag then it's off with his head
It's off with his head, it's off with his head
Drop a bag then it's off with his head
Drop a bag then it's off with his head
Drop a bag
