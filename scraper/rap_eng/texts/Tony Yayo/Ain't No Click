Yeah nigga fuckin' back hunger for more
Tony's home yo Banks I told these niggas man
Y'all done fucked up now
Here we go
Ain't no click like the one I'm with
If the drama gets thick it's the guns I get
G unit niggas is runnin' this shit
If you ain't reppin' where you from this is
We gettin' doe everywhere we go
And it's killin' 'em slow just to hear me blow
G unit niggas is runnin' this shit
If you ain't reppin' where you from sit down
By now I know you done seen me
On your stadium or TV with three eighty on the E.V
I skeet babies on your breezy and I ain't stoppin'
Only Jake the Jacob could freeze me
Leaves me and it's bye, bye gone
We got guns like Popeye arms
I put a ring on their finger but the rats still askin'
'Coz there's one in all they mind I'm the Rap Phil Jackson and
I built a rep for murderin' every Whoo Kid
Kayslay and Big Mike admit it the kid tight
And you ain't even put up a fight
So it's back to da amatures wrapped in ya sandwiches
I'm hot now so the rats wanna stand with us
They hop in the van with us and clap on cameras
I hit the clubs now I'm back tourin' Canadas
Amongst weed smokers and crap floor gamblers
Ain't no click like the one I'm with
If the drama gets thick it's the guns I get
G unit niggas is runnin' this shit
If you ain't reppin' where you from this is
We gettin' doe everywhere we go
And it's killin' 'em slow just to hear me blow
G unit niggas is runnin' this shit
If you ain't reppin' where you from sit down
Make sure the birds don't get brought to 'em
I watched Kobe go from the basketball court to the courtroom
Go ahead try to do me harm soldier
You'll be in a black bag like grass out the lawnmower
And I'll be damn if I co-sign a old snitch
That was gang bangin' when jaws was a goldfish
I'm the name they all screamin' on the street
For bullyin' the bassline and leanin' on the beat
I'm well known now so you see me on the creeps
Schemin' on a freak fan blade leanin' on a jeep
Ain't walkin' with the fire so if you say Banks in ya verse
Then you better be talkin' bout Tyra
From PA to LA, Atlanta to Texas
Nashville to Memphis my buzz is tremendous
I pass through the city slow but the hit the gas on the silly hoe
Dumps like ass in my video
Ain't no click like the one I'm with
If the drama gets thick it's the guns I get
G unit niggas is runnin' this shit
If you ain't reppin' where you from this is
We gettin' doe everywhere we go
And it's killin' 'em slow just to hear me blow
G unit niggas is runnin' this shit
If you ain't reppin' where you from sit down
A'yo, uno, duexo, troiso, quatreo
My clique eat like the 12 holy apostles
And bust down models in flushed out tahoes
Jewels froze look like we hit the lotto
P89 my clique filled wit hollows
Stun in the club get hit with yellow bottles
Don't speak ma if your neck don't swallow
'Coz 50 push Bentleys and Dre push Diablos
That Eminem money got cash in my eskro
Screws Mcduck say swimmin' in my cash flow
Yay rappers cracked man I got the best blow
Best flow Banks put me in the booth let's go
Think like castro the games in a lasso
Don't jump in the Benz without steps on the petro
God gave me this flow so I am special
And 16 bars nigga I'm finished Finito
Ain't no click like the one I'm with
If the drama gets thick it's the guns I get
G unit niggas is runnin' this shit
If you ain't reppin' where you from this is
We gettin' doe everywhere we go
And it's killin' 'em slow just to hear me blow
G unit niggas is runnin' this shit
If you ain't reppin' where you from sit down
We told y'all muthafuckaz man
Y'all niggas look like us and smell like us
But you're not us man
Lloyd Banks, hunger for fore we back nigga
50 the general Young dezzy Buck
Game the rap game is ours nigga
Hunger for more Rider music nigga
This for them Gangsta them generals them comrades
This is Rida music
