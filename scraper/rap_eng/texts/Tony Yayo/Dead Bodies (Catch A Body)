[Intro: Young Buck]
Ay, Murda
Ay, I don't think them niggas right there hungry
Ay, tell Yayo to pull that car over here

[Hook: Young Buck]
Promise that you won't tell nobody (Tell nobody)
We about to go and see a dead body
Oooh, let's shoot at everybody (Let's do this shit)
Tell me, have you ever seen a dead body?
Oooh, catch a body, catch a body (Yeah yeah yeah)
Catch a body, catch a body, let's catch a body (Oooh)
Caught a body and now we all looking at you like (Oooh)

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
Dodging these potholes, in Brooklyn with this chopper on me
I just seen a body by the bridge, yo
They say the killer killed himself in front his kids, though
Behind the steering wheel, with blood on my window
Just ran a rapper over in a brand new Benz-o
We still sell gas bags at the Sitco
Hashtag names of niggas that we know got hit before
Oooh, what up cuh, what up, piru
(What up niggas)
Homicides and drive-by's at the drive thru

[Pre-Hook: Tony Yayo]
Niggas tryna see a dead body
Moving like dope boys, see a dead body
I see dead  people, dead witnesses
Life short, we tryna end this shit
We really tryna end this shit

[Hook: Young Buck]
Promise that you won't tell nobody (Tell nobody)
We about to go and see a dead body
Oooh, let's shoot at everybody (Let's do this shit)
Tell me, have you ever seen a dead body?
Oooh, catch a body, catch a body (Yeah yeah yeah)
Catch a body, catch a body, let's catch a body (Oooh)

[Verse 3: Uncle Murda & Young Buck]
Wanna see a dead body, I had to shoot homie
Them witnesses spend some dead presidents on a new Rollie
It's bling bling with all these chains and these watches, nigga
All them dead bodies got the feds watching, nigga
Choppers knocked him out his brand new Huarache, nigga
Lay down and play dead before I shoot you niggas
I read the statements, they say feds got to get us
We put money on they heads, niggas tryin' to kill us
Like Instagram, my shooters gon' follow you, nigga
[??] pussy, your mother should've swallowed you, nigga
You got a body, yeah that's cool, shit I'm proud of you, nigga
Empty the two, you know the rule, he shouldn't have doubted you, nigga
Everybody looking at you like

[Pre-Hook: Tony Yayo]
Niggas tryna see a dead body
Moving like dope boys, see a dead body
I see dead  people, dead witnesses
Life short, we tryna end this shit
We really tryna end this shit

[Hook: Young Buck]
Promise that you won't tell nobody (Tell nobody)
We about to go and see a dead body
Oooh, let's shoot at everybody (Let's do this shit)
