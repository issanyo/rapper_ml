Nyc, Where I'm From Video:


(feat. Lloyd Banks)

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
How real is this? New York City, How real is this? New York City
America welcome to the land of the brave
America welcome to the land of the slave
Where they do anything for money the consequences is the cage
Follow the path of a dummy hop a fence into they grave
You could either live to regret or benefit from your ways
The enemies get what they deserve the innocents get disgraced
Everything ain't all gravy baby niggas subject to change
And it gotta be the paper cause niggas is actin strange
I wake up to my medicine, head throbbin, heart full of rage
Feelin dirty from haze as strong as thirty grenades
When it comes to ammunition theres 30 30s and Kays
And them Trays hold me down like that Du Rag thats on ya waves yo

[Eminem Talking:]
Aiyo, you're listening to DJ Whoo Kid right now
The official, the biggest bootlegger on the planet, the biggest bootlegger
On the planet, He will bootleg anything and everything
If you have a couch at home he will bootleg it
It will be sold in China Town at your local bodega
It doesn't matter, he is DJ Whoooooooooooo Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid

[Verse: Lloyd Banks]
How real is this? New York City, How real is this? New York City
America welcome to the land of the brave
America welcome to the land of the slave
Where they do anything for money the consequences is the cage
Follow the path of a dummy hop a fence into they grave
You could either live to regret or benefit from your ways
The enemies get what they deserve the innocents get disgraced
Everything ain't all gravy baby niggas subject to change
And it gotta be the paper cause niggas is actin strange
I wake up to my medicine, head throbbin, heart full of rage
Feelin dirty from haze as strong as thirty grenades
When it comes to ammunition theres 30 30s and Kays
And them Trays hold me down like that Du Rag thats on ya waves bro
America welcome to the land where they kill
America welcome to the land where they steal
Where niggas'll call ya bluff 'till you let 'em know shit is real
And material shit'll make bitches head over heels
Where drama appeals to most of the kids so they watch
Where they shoot at cops, and most little niggas don't know they pops
Where peer pressure comes on you smoke weed, get bent to be cool
Where the girls lose they virginity in elementary school
Where ambulances are late, club floors get left with stains
Over stepped on sneakers, nigga what set you claim
Where niggas are ghetto fabulous pullin them nice whips
Where cops'll fuck you up with flashlights and night sticks whoa
America welcome to the land where they frame you
America welcome to the land where they hang you
Where it doesn't pay to live without sin don't be a angel
In a regular day just chillin a bullet can reaarange you
Where cats'll stab you the first time they get the chance too
The envious ways of a coward won't do nothing but amp you
I'm from South Side Jamaica where convicts and stars are born
Where you can wake up in the morning and ya brand new cars gone
Where niggas that you grew up with are speedin and smokin crack
Play Russian Roulette with they dreams and theres no way to get 'em back
Where the hood rats'll surround you to concentrate on ya stack
Its kinda hard to keep ya cool when theres constant heat on ya back

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
New York City thats where I stay
Where every day is foul play
We got ours so you should have yours
Cause it won't be no warnings when its time to go to war
New York City thats where I'm from
I got my vest I got my gun
And you should run
If you ain't got one
Cause it won't be no warnings when them niggas' fours come

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
Yo Banks, let me shine
I got *Timberwolves in Minnesota*
And got them *New York Knicks* up in that baking soda homie
I cross over with Rugers in *Vancouver when its grizzly*
In a *Portland Trailblazer* if your ass don't hit me
You get shot in your *cavs in Cleveland*
Start bleedin', and now you wanna bitch and can't ball all season
Yo I'm rollin' *phillies up with the 76ers*
And got my *heat up in Miami* on the beach with my niggas
And them hoes from *Atlanta is hawkin*
Cuz they see them *Denver nuggets* on my neck while my ass is walkin'
Stash the gun
Now I'm in *Phoenix sun*
Cuz I'm a *Golden State warrior* that stay on the run
I'm in the truck
Countin' up *Milwakee bucks*
And I stay with the wratchet cuz thats whats up
I got a *wizard in DC* that chef up o's
So I'm livin like a *king in Sacramento*
When I'm out in *Chicago I'm on some bullshit*
You know semi automatic I stay with a full clip
With them *Houston rockets*
Baby nine in my pocket
Hypnotic and balm chronic
Bang you with the *sonics*
I'm that nigga that'll *Los Angeles clip you*
Slow your *pace in Indiana* when you countin' them figures
Yo I'm out in *New Orleans whoadie duckin' them warrants
You get stung by my Mac like a batch of hornets*
Time to splurge like the *San Antonio Spurs*
I got rings like a *Laker* bubble *celtic birds*
Disappear like *magic, Dallas mavericks* in the gat
And I'll *Detroit piss* on you while you lyin on your back
Strip shorty out her bra you know I get ass
Cause the kid big ballin' like the *Utah Jazz*
*Toronto Raptors* style Yay is a vet
I move like a *Net*
So cut that check nigga
