[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yo, this is 50 cent, yaknawsaying?
I'm here with my man Whoo Kid
You know how I put it down. nigga
It's not safe around here as soon as the street lights
G-Unit. nigga

[Hook: 50 Cent]
We can't get money selling weed - (we gon' sell coke)
Ain't no money selling coke - (we gon' sell dope)
Ain't no money selling dope - (we gon' sell X)
And if niggas won't buy the X - (then we gon' sell tech's

[Verse 1]
My advice for y'all niggas is stop frontin'
Cause if 50 say "pop something" I'm gon pop something, what up?

[50 Cent]
Don't make me send a nigga to you, 16 shot ruger
Send twelve shots to you, run four in the clip
Get in the whip, it's a wrap

[Havoc]
Nah, fuck that

[50 Cent]
Man, you done hit the nigga twice in the head, that's that
Niggas running with the steel out, now it's time to peel out

[Tony Yayo]
50 let me drive

[50 Cent]
Nah, I got this, nigga, chill out

[Lloyd Banks]
It'd be nice to get a niggas' ice, get it, getting  back

[50 Cent]
Just get in the corner store cause it's full of them Arabs
They blowing the shit up like it's okay
I got a bomb on my waist, I'm Kamikaze
I dare D's to get next to me

[]
Or a nigga to creep up and put a tec to me

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, yeah that's-that's it, nigga
That's it, it's a freestyle
The fuck you want for free?
Fucking Arabs just ran the fucking planes into the building
Coke price went up 10 grand this fucking week
