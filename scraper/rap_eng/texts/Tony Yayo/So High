Man I, get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go?
Take two puffs and then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that
It's the up north title taker, rollin' lah
In that Riker's Island Bible paper, high as a skyscraper
I'm fresh out of jail smokin' pounds of haze
Duckin' my P.O. 'cause I'm high for days
Hydro, weed-O got my mind in the zone
Don't fuck up my high bitch, leave me alone
Let it spread to the head, two pulls and pass
Stop steamin' on the weed girl, make it last
I'm so high, Banks so high
Buck so high, Dre so high
We be gettin' high smokin' chocolate tye
That's why I got the cottonmouth and my throat is dry
Yo I'm out in L.A. at the cheeba spot
While you lightin' up dirt where the seeds'll pop
And I'm chasin' it down, with Henny and Hypno'
Two pulls and pass, you know how fast the weed go
Man I, get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go?
Take two puffs and then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that
Man I, get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go?
Take two puffs and then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that
I'm hittin' G-13 in that 645
Eyes real low, it's gettin' hard to drive
And I pray to God po's don't pull me over
'Cause the coupe real smoky off that green Arizona
Smoke on Monday, parole on Tuesday
Golden seal pills, don't use that usually
But I be gettin' high nigga doin' my thing
So my eyes Chinese 'cause I'm high like Yao Ming
Roll up all night, head get right
The hash plant mixed with that northern light, right
White rhino, white weirdo
Light people roll up that indo
Jamaican people roll that Bob Marley
Wind up your body, stink up the party
And we be puffin' hard 'til the weed is done
'Cause we got love for that Cheech and Chong
Man I, get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go?
Take two puffs and then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that
Man I, get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go?
Take two puffs and then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that
Come smoke with me, come ride with me
Come toke with me, let your mind be free
This here ain't for no folks on asthma
My vision's like plasma
Come smoke with me, get high with me
Take a toke with me, let your mind be free
This here ain't for no folks on asthma
My vision's like plasma, whoa
So high
So high
So high
