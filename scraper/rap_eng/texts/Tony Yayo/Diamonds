Money in my pocket, am feeling like Zigga, I tell Brenda turnUp
I run the town, I saw Tony Yayo and we did a line
In music my nigga, get off the gutter and stop thinking blind
My nigga My nigga, Don't fuck with these niggas, we coming hot

We in the business men it is do or die but a nigga got rich
Half a milli men and a penthouse but it's all in the north
If it's Kanye West and he's kinda best, Ma nigga we nuts
In the money business, try me get shot my nigga behave

Trap fellas Run Dallas, Motherfucker we owe nothing to you
Tie the yayo don't pass it yet, Motherfucker gotta count the bills
Born dead can't die, Try me you go testify
When am talking to you, you better listen or the 45 talk for me

My nigga they talk for me ..ah
They talk for me
My nigga they talk for me ..shit
They talk for me
My nigga they talk for me ..ah
They talk for me
My nigga they talk for me
Yaaaa

Selfmade, SelfConsultant Imma self-paid
When they ask me where the money at, I tell em it's a self lane
Shoot you is the first thing, Take your money is the next thing
Do I say it again mo fuckers take all you can

Ya know, give nothing back motherfuckers
Am all, My nigga am all
Am all, Mofoker am all


Tony Yayo

All we do is hustle my nigga, and try to stack the paper
You a Nanobite nigga, in my streaming data
Never let the setbacks distract the money
Desperation is dangerous haters looking funny

I drive by, 2017 ride got these niggas like OMG
Cruise through the hood retired drug dealer
Pose on the backseat and definitely kill ya
And kill ya, cos shit is real in the ride and die
Want a steak, Push your shit back

Or Push a Nigga back if he's fucking with the papers
Young slow nigga go get your green papers
My nigga we rich like a bastard
I got Tony Yayo trapping with me
The G-Unit Squad they signed it
My Nigga am rich and am gone
If you ever doubt me F you
Me and Yayo talking Scrutiny
The Money keeps pilling
Up to the ceiling
Young Nigga balling
Everyday when I drive through your hood Imma make the paaaaaaper
And the cops can't fuck with me cos it is daaaaaaaaanger
You a king to a city who crown you
F with me and I tag you out and my niggas they all take you out

It's the Scrutiny baby
