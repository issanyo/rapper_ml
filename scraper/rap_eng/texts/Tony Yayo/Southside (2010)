Southside
(2x)

Im from where all the warriors come from
Nigga is ‘bout a three hundred with handguns
I hit the coloseum up and pump the bentley on the roof
Feelin‘ like Papi makes you jumpen out the cupe
Niggas talkin crazy, that'll be the death for you
Mortician make-up, your family missin you
Im a gangsta, hell i am tough
Ya pussy niggas let'n crackheads beat yall up
I got the goal, i ball, cris paul
An a psychic can read my life threw a crystallball
Two bricks on konsami, federalis can't find me
My southside state of mine is oh so grimey
Guns fresh out the box keep makin me hard
Niggas swing on me, you will spawn with god
Masarati pull off like a rollercoster
I got them cars staked up on the motor cultures
World full of vultures, phone full of soldiers
These dusty niggas dolges, i make their life over
Yeah, and i ain‘ really worried about when the narcs hit
House in the woods, got the bear proof garbage
My jewish lawer tell off the charges
The money got my in Maui, all the models narcers
Ducati monster, out in the fucking law
Cause im a outlaw with a fucking fourtyfour

Southside, where im from
Southside, where im from
Southside, where im at
Southside, where i be
Big gun on me
