[Hook: Laganja Estranja]
Legs over head like a pretzel
You know you want it
You like how I throw it back like a missile
I got my legs over head like a pretzel
You know you want it
You like how I throw it back like a missile

[Verse 1: Laganja Estranja]
Legs long, waist thin
Nice thighs, bet you wanna taste them
Thick lips, where you wanna place them?
So, where you wanna place them?
I ain't even mention the coup de gras
The cassava melons in my perler bra
Put my legs up high like a handstand
Is the new pre-sex anthem
(Legs over head like a pretzel, pretzel, pretzel, pretzel)
Why you still got your pants on?
Come and hold these legs up ransom
Gotta poundcake you can come grab on
I smoke marijuana, puff passing on ya'
Pussy on a platter silver plate
My legs go to heavens pearly gates
You can jack this box its open late
Twist-Twist me how you want why would you wait?

[Hook: Laganja Estranja]
Legs over head like a pretzel
You know you want it
You like how I throw it back like a missile
I got my legs over head like a pretzel
You know you want it
You like how I throw it back like a missile

[Post-Chorus: Laganja Estranja] (x2)
Legs over head
You know you want it, want it
You know you want it, want it
Throw it back like a missile

[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
Imma sit this ass on ya
If you got a small one I might pass on ya
But he still won't spend this cash on one
Said the cuts can't take so they gagging on me
Got em fronting like they bitches
Running to his boys saying how he miss this
Now he wanna kiss this, heard I got the juice
And its so tight, nah I ain't loose, loose
So sweet in all kinds of flavors
Imma go off on ya neighbors
Yeah you want my legs on your headboard
Ride it real good like a surfboard
Beat it up, beat it up
Ain't no slowing down
Queen me bitch coz I got the crown
Ha, Like I throw it back
I throw it back like he throwing them racks

[Hook: Laganja Estranja]
Legs over head like a pretzel
You know you want it
You like how I throw it back like a missile
I got my legs over head like a pretzel
You know you want it
You like how I throw it back like a missile

[Bridge]
Damn she got booty in the pants (x7)
Damn she got

[Verse 3: Laganja Estranja]
He like the way I bend, flex
Toes in the air you like my reflex, reflex
He laughed and said I did that
He popped it like a cork
And then he showered on my knee caps
Ain't ever seen a bitch this long
Stretched out in a Versace thong
I sweat and get my lotus on
Let it drip non-stick heat it up like Typhlon
I can do it spilt
Then you can take a dip
Ankles at 180 baby this my circus you my favorite trick
You can strap my lips to some indo
Then throw my face in the pillow
Then work your way to the middle
Eat my shit up like a pretzel

[Hook: Laganja Estranja]
Legs over head like a pretzel
You know you want it
You like how I throw it back like a missile
I got my legs over head like a pretzel
You know you want it
You like how I throw it back like a missile

[Post-Chorus: Laganja Estranja] (x2)
Legs over head
You know you want it, want it
You know you want it, want it
Throw it back like a missile
