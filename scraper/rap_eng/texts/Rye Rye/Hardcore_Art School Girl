Why keep it real so you wanna hang out
Going to the club so you let it hang out
G's in the crib so you know they bang out
Sucka ass niggas get left on the couch

Even Superwoman couldn't put her hands on this
All the honeys in the club keep watchin'
To the right when I come through rockin'
Hardcore girls keep it lockin'

Watch out when I come through ?
Move to the right when I ?
Hardcore girls keep it lockin'

Anything thrown I can handle it

No need to tell me so cause I know I got game

All the honeys in the club keep watchin'
