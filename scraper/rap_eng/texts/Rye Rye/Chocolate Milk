[Intro]
B-b-boom, chocolate milk

[Chorus]
Need to bring that boy back
The one that know how to act, yeah
Need to bring that boy back
The one that know how to act, yeah
Need to bring that boy back
The one that know how to act, yeah
Need to...
B-b-boom, chocolate milk
B-b-boom, chocolate milk
B-b-boom, chocolate milk
B-b-boom, chocolate milk

[Verse 1]
They say I'm a bad girl, I give off them bad vibes
But I just tell it like it is and kill off them bad guys
No stepping up in my face 'cause I got a bad taste
But I got a slim waste that's making 'em all chase
Only thing I want is to be happy
The dudes I come across, they be hella tacky
Now where the good ones at, the heavy hooks on that
I need to bring that boy back
The one that know how to act, yeah

[Chorus]
I need to bring that boy back
The one that know how to act, yeah
Bring that boy back
The one that know how to act, yeah
Bring that boy back
The one that know how to act, yeah
I need to...
B-b-boom, chocolate milk

Bring that boy back, yeah
B-b-boom, chocolate milk

[Verse 2]
You know I say what I feel like, no time for the girl fights
If it ain't 'bout my [?] you know it don't sound right
If he ain't motivation then you know I can't steer, right?
And if he just Goliath, then you know he the ill type
I just wanna live life with no fucks and no stress
He ain't bringing out the best and he got stuck with
Where the good ones at, the heavy hooks on that
I need to bring that boy back
The one that know how to... ...yeah

[Outro]
Bring that boy back
The one that know how to act, yeah
Need to bring that boy back
The one that know how to act, yeah
Need to bring that boy back
The one that know how to act, yeah
Need to...
B-b-boom, chocolate milk
