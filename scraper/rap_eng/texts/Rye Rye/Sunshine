*(Chorus)*
Sunshine it's a friend of mine
At the school line, checkin' all the boys who were fine
We were in line when we got the first sign
The boy she liked checkin' out was mine

Doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom
Doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom

Doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom
Doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom

And this time I'm flamed
Cold blooded in this, yeah you know my name
Home girl I'm doing my thing
Put it down and in the real that's just my game
No hoes they Ain't the same
Start feeling their stuff start acting up
Some thought (our ass?) start back it up
Tell my homies on the track lets wrap it up
But, we go ghost riding
Got the pumps in the back
Let a hoe keep hiding
We jump beside it
Stomp the yard, to the club, on the floor we sliding
Pop a juice when they see me shine
Fellows take my coat hang it on the rec line
Now its time and we proceed
Come get with me if you know my seat

*(Chorus)*
Sunshine it's a friend of mine
At the school line, checkin' all the boys who were fine
We were in line when we got the first sign
The boy she liked checkin' out was mine

Doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom
Doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom

Doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom

Doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom

Hot girls keep looking
Post it up throwing up so mad cos I'm looking
I can get yo man and his friend too
All I do is crack a smile when they fall through
I'm so bad and they so not
Turning my back tell 'em go kick rocks
He said, she said, they said, ah
When I say, you say, we all say, ah
I don't take home losers
You come through my hood ya right after school ya
Got my right hand girl on one side
The left side make sure you up high
Ain't' my fault got my girls on my side
We stay calm, fuck girls gone wild
And you know we hit the chop beat up?
Man I told you once, yo that's what's up

*(Chorus)*
Sunshine it's a friend of mine
At the school line, checkin' all the boys who were fine
We were in line when we got the first sign
The boy she liked checkin' out was mine

Doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom
Doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom

Doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom
Doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom

Doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom doom
