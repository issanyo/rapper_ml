Get ready, get, get, get ready
Get, get ready, get, get, get ready
See I've been in it for a minute
Holding my spot down

I ain't seein' no shit that could move a crowd
I ain't seein' no shit that moves likes this
I ain't seein' no shit comin' on like this
'Cause I'm a rider

And everything I just turn cut
I came to school, you dizzy ducks
Like the games, I'm fun, I'm too cool for my own shit
Swag's outrageous, my style's retarded, I'm so contagious

Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play
Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play
Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play
Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play

Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play
Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play
Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play
Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play

See I've been down for a minute but I'm right on time
It's gonna take two of me just to steal my shine
Check the streets and my stats if you think I'm lyin'
And with a body like this you can sway, I'm wrong 'cause I'm erotic

And everything I just turn cut
I came to school you dizzy ducks
Like the games, I'm fun, I'm too cool for my own shit
Swag's outrageous, my style's retarded, I'm so contagious

Holla, holla, come on let the drum play
Holla, holla, come on let the drum play
Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play
Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play

Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play
Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play
Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play
Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play

Get, get ready, get, get, get ready
Get, get ready, get, get, get ready
Get, get ready, get, get, get ready
Get, get ready, get, get, get ready

Get, get ready, get, get, get ready
Get, get ready, get, get, get ready
Get, get ready, get, get, get ready
Get, get ready, get, get, get ready

Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play
Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play
Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play
Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play

Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play
Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play
Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play
Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play
