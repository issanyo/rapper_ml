[Rye Rye:]
So, I was sitting outside one day
Waiting for the dude to come down my way
Praying, wishing, hoping, thinking
And I felt my emotions sinking
I've been waiting for the phone to ring
I check constantly, but it was all a dream
I never thought you could be so mean!
Tired of the waiting, so it's time to come clean
And why do boys have to be so shady?
First it's all good and he's glad you his lady
Baby this, baby that, see another chick and he act like that
But the thing with me, I can't take it
Kept it 100, was real, now face it!
You gonna eat your words and I'ma make you happen
So, we're ready for the action

[Chorus: Robyn]
'Cause you never were, and you never will be mine!
That's right, that's right, that's right!
That's right, that's right, that's right!
No, you never were, and you never will be mine!
That's right, that's right, that's right!
That's right, that's right, that's right!
There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
But you always keep passing me by
No, you never were, and you never will be mine!

[Rye Rye:]
Yo, Yo, Yo
If you havin' problems with the one you love so much
And you wanna feel his touch
Put your hands in the air, let them know that you truly care
You don't wanna do the fight fuss
Getting sick of the love pain
All the lies and the trust games
Guessing, age don't make a difference
And I'm getting fed up, so listen!
First you told me that you loved me dearly
I loved you, did I make that clearly?
And you're thinking that you can play my game
But I wanna think twice, so retain my claim
And I'm kinda mad at myself, cause I let you get the best of me
To confess to me, her, oh boy, I'm through!
Tell that chick that she better get at you

[Chorus: Robyn]
'Cause you never were, and you never will be mine!
That's right, that's right, that's right!
That's right, that's right, that's right!
No, you never were, and you never will be mine!
That's right, that's right, that's right!
That's right, that's right, that's right!
There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
But you always keep passing me by
No, you never were, and you never will be mine!

[Rye Rye:]
Question: what happened to forever?
Me and you always together!
Too bad I was too much clever, can't be played a fool
That's never
Hope she made you happy or whatever
Learn from the past, proceed, get better
Good girl gone mad
Guess you didn't realize just what you had

[Robyn:]
'Cause you never were, and you never will be mine!
That's right, that's right, that's right!
That's right, that's right, that's right!
No, you never were, and you never will be mine!
That's right, that's right, that's right!
That's right, that's right, that's right!

'Cause you never were, and you never will be mine!
That's right, that's right, that's right!
That's right, that's right, that's right!
No, you never were, and you never will be mine!
That's right, that's right, that's right!
That's right, that's right, that's right!

There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
But you always keep passing me by
No, you never were, and you never will be mine!
