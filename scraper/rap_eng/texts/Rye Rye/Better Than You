[Intro]
"Anything you can do I can do better"
"I can do anything better than you"
"No you can't"
"Yes I can"
"Can't"

[Hook: Rye Rye]
I see you're in the magazines jackin' my shit ("No you can't")
I see you're on the street straight rockin' my shit ("No you can't")
But I do it better, way better than the chick ("No you can't")
So while she do it small, I'mma do it real big

[Verse 1: Rye Rye]
That whole outift that you're wearing just dead
I showed you how to do it, like you was my kid
I was some big hair, and she went and got a wig
Where they do that at? Bitches coppin' red wigs
I got them posh lips, the real Dr. Martens
Shawty said she got hers from the Walmart-in
She's sarcastic, but I'm just smart and
What I said, did she take it to the heart, man?

[Interlude]
"Anything you can do I can do better" ("No you can't")
"I can do anything better than you"

[Hook: M.I.A., Sample & Rye Rye]
So you're in the magazines wearing my shit ("No you can't")
You look good but I do it—"better"
Heard you singing songs that sounds like me ("No you can't")
You do it good but I do it—"better than you"
And when I wear my tennis shoes, I wear 'em way better
And when I wear my heels, I wear 'em—"better"
And when I get my hair done, I get it way better
Then I go and get my nails done—"better than you"

[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
Shawty got braids, so he swear that he a thug
I got that Amy Chu, so I look at him and mug
He standin' on the corner, posted up, with a [?]
But I don't do those, I can post too, what's up
He got on Jay's, I got the newer ones
You got dark blue, then I'm rockin' the bluer ones
She got on the dress, I got on the cuter ones
And she go to public school, I got to tutor 'em

[Hook: M.I.A., Sample & Rye Rye]
So you're in the magazines wearing my shit
You look good but I do it—"better"
Heard you singing songs that sounds like me
You do it good but I do it—"better than you"
And when I wear my tennis shoes, I wear 'em way better
And when I wear my heels, I wear 'em—"better"
And when I get my hair done, I get it way better
Then I go and get my nails done—"better than you"

[Verse 3: M.I.A.]
I got imitators, haters, and some psychos
But what I hate most are bitches who are fame-hoes
Seen her at the party posing for photos
She don't think about the world past painting clothes
Girls been doing rounds at the local mall
And I bet you too, doing dudes in rock 'n' roll
Facebook, face facts, girl you know that
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, you should post that

[Hook: M.I.A., Sample & Rye Rye]
So you're in the magazines wearing my shit
You look good but I do it—"better"
Heard you singing songs that sounds like me
You do it good but I do it—"better than you"
And when I wear my tennis shoes, I wear 'em way better
And when I wear my heels, I wear 'em—"better"
And when I get my hair done, I get it way better
Then I go and get my nails done—"better than you"

[Outro: M.I.A. & Rye Rye]
You wanna be the next, wanna-wanna be the next
Wanna-wanna be the next big thing, [?]
Wanna be the next, wanna-wanna be the next
Wanna-wanna be the next big thing, [?]
(I see you're in the magazines jackin' my shit
I see you're on the street straight rockin' my shit
But I do it better, way better than the chick
So while she do it small, I'mma do it real big)
Wanna be the next, wanna-wanna be the next
Wanna-wanna be the next big thing, [?]
Wanna be the next, wanna-wanna be the next
Wanna-wanna be the next big thing, [?]
(I see you're in the magazines jackin' my shit
I see you're on the street straight rockin' my shit
But I do it better, way better than the chick
So while she do it small, I'mma do it real big)
