I got a smart mouth like I got good grades
So fresh and new that I can never age
I'm like a Virgin Mary, I ain't never laid

Swag so fresh, walk so mean
I never been a mess, I gotta stay clean
And now I bring with L's, losers and lames
I run my own race, I'm in my own lane

Yeah, we can get it popping 'cause I'm with that
I'm like dope money, I could flip that
Everything you think it's new, boo, I done did that
Hair, nails, outfit, please say you did that

Everybody love me but it ain't about my thuggy
Everybody love me but it ain't about my thuggy
Everybody love me but it ain't about my thuggy
Wanna squeeze me, wanna thug me
Wanna wear me like a snuggy

See, I ain't tripping, I'm the ish
I got dumb girls, I get money, live life then I die old
My futuristic swag make these girls look dumb old
And I ain't even fronting ice but I'm damn cold

I'm not around the way, girl, I've been around the world
I buy my own diamonds, I buy my own pearls
And good for nothing, corny woman make me wanna hurl
I like that independent woman that can handle hers

I'm so sick with it but they don't get it, get it
Forget the funny faces, I tell them run with it
They call me hot stuff 'cause I blaze, blaze
I like his eyes low off the haze, haze

Oh, yeah, get out my way
Tell the DJ put it on the replay
All I wanna do aye, aye, aye
Is let the DJ play it all day
