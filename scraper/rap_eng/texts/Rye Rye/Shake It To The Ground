[Intro]
Shake it to the ground
Shake it to the ground, ground
Shake it to the ground
Shake it, and bring it back up

[Chorus x2]
Shake it to the ground
(Mo-mo-mo-move it, move it)
Shake it, shake it, and bring it back up
(Mo-mo-mo-move it, move it)
Shake it to the ground
(Mo-mo-mo-move it, move it)
Shake it, shake it, and bring it back up
(Move it, move it, move it, move it)

[Verse 1]
You can bring it back up and make the fellas say damn
Damn shawty how you manage to do that dance
The way I shake it, I be bringin all the boys to the yard
I take money from you suckers, I be playin my cards
And I be shakin my bootay, you know it's a trap
I be blowin they mind, I make them niggas collapse
All my ladies if you shake it then you know it's a rap
When we be throwin it back, we make 'em throw them stacks

And I'm the youngest, sexy
Real girls fall, fake girls talk
Real girls shake, fake girls hate
But Rye Rye, I'm the one that's great
And I'ma shake it to the ground and bring it back up
Twirl it all around, yeah you know what's up
I'ma shake it to the ground and bring it back up
And twirl it all around, yeah you know what's up

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yeah I'm young and sexy boy, yeah you know I'm the one
I'm the hottest chick around, I'm the one that they want
Because I'm sexy, I'm fly and I be keepin it real
I'm gangsta, I'm hot and I be really on chills
I got a bangin ass body that the boys can't resist
That's why all around the town I'm known as chocolate kisses
I don't fall for dem sissies, yeah I'm hot as a rock
Everytime I hit the block, I make your faces drop

Who could ever know a chick that could spit like I do
I'm conceided, I take the cake from you fools
See your face is all blue yeah you know I'm the truth
Can't no other girl out here do what I do
Well I'm back to reality and speaking my name
I'm a bossy chick in the hall of fame
But I be struttin my stuff, gettin along with my doors
I'm not a gangsta girl, but I'm a ghetto superstar

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah I'm hotter than that, but yeah I'm doin it big
I'ma be the winner girl for the rest of the year
If you wanna look me up cause you know I'm the bomb
Holla at me I be on Blaqstarr dot com
All that studded stuff, that ain't on my level
Chill back, that's me, I had to take it to another level
Popped one, popped two, I popped you
I got the power of titman and yeah I stopped you

All my haters and imitators and duplicators
Holla at me when you diggin the way I made it
Cause I'm cool n fine, I'm a feisty girl
You can't buy me I'm a priceless girl
But I'ma shake it to the ground and bring it back up
Twirl it all around, yeah you know what's up
I'ma shake it to the ground and bring it back up
And twirl it all around, yeah you know what's up

[Chorus]
