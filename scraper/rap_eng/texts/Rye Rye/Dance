Walk up in this party, I'm feelin' naughty
I might hit the dance floor and freak up on somebody
Don't know what I'm sayin', sayin', sayin', sayin', sayin', sayin'
So you can put it into dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
A little closer now
We came to party, so put your hands up
My girls, we bossy and we don't give a fuck
I hope you understand, stand, stand, stand, stand, stand
So I can put it into dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
Cause I'm a get it out

[Verse 1:]
Yo baby I'm so sick and tired
Better not use that dump on Rye
Baby say you don't need that bass
Through you can do whatever you like
Tell me what's that sounded like
Mean, I don't think that sounded right
And I'm a save your spot d-d-down tonight
And yeah, how'd you get in in, show me something I like
Can I get a drumroll
Cause I'm so cut from my hair to my toes
And I ain't no bluff, everything I do shows
And bitches be fuckin', I never been one of those
And yeah I keep my games high
Yeah I wanna stand right
I ain't going under till the end of the tunnel pipe
Ah ah ah
Let's go
Let me see that booty roll

[Hook:]
Walk up in this party, I'm feelin' naughty

Cause I'm a get it out

[Verse 2:]
I get naughty, I get crazy, I get slizzy, but never get lazy
Girls like me wanna have fun
No time for the bitches that be actin' all drunk
You can like me, but don't bite me
All you chicks now wanna come and fight me
Can't help that I come off lightly
And your girlfriend wanna be just like me
Heard you lookin' for a bo-bo-boss
That be me, ain't worried about the cost
If you thinkin' you can cost some shoots
Pick a game motherfucker, 'till you're right to cause
Purdy kid, come up with the sayin'
I'm a brawl like the lastest slein'
I'm a let it go cold like a shot
And I call all night cause I just can't stop
