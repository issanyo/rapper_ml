I drop to the floor, it's nothing, drop to the floor, it's nothing
It's scraping on the floor, it's scraping on the floor
Back it, back it up and gimme some more
It's in the, I, I bring it down low and get low, with it

Low with it, I'm seeing you go with it
Get up, go, get it, move your body real slow with it
Get up, slow with it, I'm seein' at, go with it
Get up, go, get it

I wanna get it good, when I fly a boy chillin' over there
I wonder if he noticed that I want him over here
I see him watch them hers, I show mine's every year
I dropped it down low, I put my booty in the air

And I'm a rockstar so you know I don't care
Till I fly your shit, when I fly your hair
And I'm so sick of the aerish chair
I'm a hot girl, don't white girl share

I drop to the floor, it's nothing, I drop to the floor, it's nothing
It's scraping on the floor, it's scraping on the floor
Back it, back it up and gimme some more
As in, I, I bring it down low and get low, with it

Low, with it, I'm seeing you go with it
Get up, go, get it, move your body real slow with it
Get up, slow with it, I'm seein' at, go with it
Get up, go, get it

And I hope I got time to be joking
Boys in the back must smoking
It's in the this holla, on the dance floor roastin'
And fake cheeks and my face keep pelsing

I'm lookin' at him real smooth like cool
And he lookin' at me like, "Girl, how you do this? "
I brought my hips real slow, we can do it
It's getting rough girl, go music

I drop to the floor, it's nothing, drop to the floor, it's nothing
It's scraping on the floor, it's scraping on the floor
Back it, back it up and gimme some more
As in, I, I bring it down low and get low with it

Low with it I'm seeing you go with it
Get up, go, get it, move your body real slow with it
Get up, slow with it, I'm seein' at, go get it
Get up, go, get it

Move your body to the bass line
Dude, now you got your hands on my waist line
Hurry up, I don't waste time
You rude boy, I had it to the great fine

You talking real slick, I like that
You blowing kiss kiss, blow right back
You can call me candy girl 'cause I'm so sweet
You can see the way I work so you know I'm not weak

I drop to the floor, it's nothing, drop to the floor, it's nothing
You can call me candy girl 'cause I'm so sweet
You can call me candy girl 'cause I'm so sweet
Drop the eight away, so you know I'm goin' free
Drop the eight away, so you know I'm goin' free

You can call me candy girl 'cause I'm so sweet
You can call me candy girl 'cause I'm so sweet
Drop the eight away, so you know I'm goin' free
Drop the eight away, so you know I'm goin' free

Yo, go, get it with your right leg, go, get it with your left leg
Go, get it with your cornbread, go, get it like a chicken head
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
