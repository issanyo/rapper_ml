[Hook: Zion I]
Hit him with the, hit him with the, hit him with the heavyweight
Hit him with the heavyweight
Make, make the room shake
Hit him with the, hit him with the, hit him with the heavyweight
Hit him with the heavyweight
Make, make the room shake
Hit him with the, hit him with the, hit him with the heavy weight
Hit him with the heavyweight
Make, make the room shake
Make the, make the room, make the room, make the room shake
Make the room shake

[Verse 1: Zion I]
Back in the lab, Muay Thai kickin' bags
Mashin' the gas like I'm Mad Max
Master catastrophe, where the dance at?
Ring the alarm, I'm comin' to impact
Ready with that jumbo, down in the jungle
Heavy hitting how we get it done boy, y'all now know
Steady with the rumble, I hit 'em with the combo
How we wreck up, have a party poppin' in the condo

[Chorus: Rye Rye]
When I'm in my own zone, I be feelin' so wavy
And when that bass drop, I be goin' so crazy
Get me so hot, so they all wanna blaze me
At the top of the world, your bad vibes don't phase me

[Hook: Zion I]
Hit him with the, hit him with the, hit him with the heavyweight
Hit him with the heavyweight
Make, make the room shake
Hit him with the, hit him with the, hit him with the heavyweight
Hit him with the heavyweight
Make, make the room shake
Hit him with the, hit him with the, hit him with the heavy weight
Hit him with the heavyweight
Make, make the room shake
Make the, make the room, make the room, make the room shake
Make the room shake

[Verse 2: Zion I]
Chillin' with my clique when the beat kick
Keep it nice and decent
Neighbors wanna go alert the precinct
Stand like a sphinx in a tight fix
Slicker than a skate mate
You don't really want it to get ill mate
I'll assume you'll catch up with the tailgate
This is not a stalemate, sorta like a jailbreak, heavyweight
Meditate your body when I serenade, uh, uh
Breaking out the party, couldn't barricade, uh, uh

[Chorus: Rye Rye]
When I'm in my own zone, I be feelin' so wavy
And when that bass drop, I be goin' so crazy
Get me so hot, so they all wanna blaze me
At the top of the world, your bad vibes don't phase me
