[Verse 1: Far East Movement]
Hola, Yo ma, I'm on the east side coolin' with my chola
No we're at the bar granola
Hit the henny with the cherry tree cola
Hey let's get closer
Turn around, spread it out, yoga
Make the kids turn rock, boulder
Bang bang we will yoda

[Interlude (2x): Rye Rye]
Pour it out, tip it up
Keep that drink up in my cup
Pour it out, tip it up
Keep that drink up in my cup

[Verse 2: Far East Movement]
We heading uptown
No chasing
Who wanna roll a hundred spoke, date is
Two chicks on my lap, scraping

With her back she stack lego
Play with your g string, cello
Cherokee chick called me long fellow
Hit her with the stick, now she call me donatello
