It's in my DNA-ehay-ehay-ehay (that's right)
So let the music play-ehay-ehay (let it, let it)
It's in my DNA-ehay-ehay-ehay (rock wid it)
I was born to shut it down

Rye Rye

Eh, It's natural
I don't need no Adderall
And just let the beat bump
And Imma make yo bodies jump
All my chickas reports to the dance floor
Or, better yet, sweat our your dance pores
Pull out cho weaves
Done for
These niggas run the world, I rep fo um

We get stupid, we get dumb
Party all night
Till we numb
I got shades on, forget a hater
And don't be throwing no ass in tha ...?
That's right, that's right
We can keep these niggas till they turn on the lights
Let's go, Let's go
Cause a party ain't a party till you put on a show
Natural killah-killah
Now my body move realer-realer
Up in the club, screamin' we don't give a fuck
...?

This is a party anthem
Hand in tha air
You can talk that shit
But truly, we don't really care
And tonight, you came to party
Hands in tha air
And you're feelin' yourself getting zoned out
Say hell yeah
I said, put me on the dance floor
And you can catch me freakin' on a bad boy
Workin' my body-yoddie-ah
And I'm feeling so naughty-oddie-oddia-ah
Now when the DJ spin that record
We be goin' reckless
We be throwin' shades, party rockin', and two-steppin'

I said it's in my DNA
We just came to rock and play
From the window to the wall-all-ah-ah-all
Show some skin, put on a show
Getcho boodies on the flo
From the window to the wall-all-ah-ah-all
