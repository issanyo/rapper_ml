I just wanna be an awesome mothafucka
Shinin like a star that’s why they love her
And I don’t give a damn about no other
blah blah blah blah blah shut up

I was born to  be an awesome mothafucka
Shinin like a star that’s why they love her
And I don’t give a damn about no other
Blah blah blah blah blah shut up

[Verse]
With my shades all black
Riding in the whip you know Im maybach
Dolla dolla yeah I chase that
If you got a bit spliffy I might blaze that
We just out here having fun
Doing whatever we want
We don’t follow rules none
Get it popping like a gun
Hit the party and it pop
Bitches come outta they top
Every party we gonn hop
And we got em all on lock
Dj play my song yeah you know Im jamming
Walk in the bitch and everybody round here standing
We just took over the floor you know they staring
And we be rockin to the beat we aint caring

[breakdown]
It Don't matter where you stay
I could bring you to the bay
I could bring it to L.A
Anyway you wanna play
Tell them what they gonna say
Know the girl she gonn slay

So keep that drama shit away
