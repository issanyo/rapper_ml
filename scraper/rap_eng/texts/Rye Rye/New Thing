[Intro]
Uh, uh [x2]
Get, get, get ready

[Verse 1]
What you know about the new thing, new thing?
Uh-uh, uh-uh, we ain't the same thing
Hair so new, style so new
Everything new, because I'm just cool!
Currently cause they didn't get the memo... superstar eh check out my zimo
See why I got a big ego, And yeah, I talk shit, check out my stage, yo!
Superstar da! I came to be here
Waiting to the beat I came to see ya
X-O-X-O, hugs and kisses
This is in the air, nice to meet, ya!
Long ago, with my lingo
Need a cup of wine to hang and beat ya!
From the club yo, to the big show
Because baby, your type my thing, yo
Is that girl la, la, la, I heard she got style so fly
Is she like super guys, a superstar bitch oh my

[Chorus x2]
You want that good thing, that good thing
Got-got that, that good thing
You want a hot style, that new thing
We have the same thing cause I'm a new name
You want that good thing, that good thing
Got-got that, that good thing
You want a hot style, that new thing
We have the same thing cause I'm a new name

[Verse 2]
I can say that you want me on my side
Little boys, little boys on my side hip
Come here baby, get attention like a side ship
See the boy right there?
That's my side!
Get to the tech to the tone, tone, tone
Always wear mammies in the road, road, road
And I'm a show star myself, show, show, show
When I run it like a rodeo, oh, oh, oh!
Work it, work it, put and rehearse it
Hot flavourz if you wanna come and burst it
Flip it, flip it, I'll show you how to dip it
I ain't willow but I'll show you how to whip it!

[Chorus]

[Middle Eight x2]
You gotta jump around, you gotta make the sound
I'm feeling bad, I'm coming from!
If you want the same thing (holla holla)
Set the roof on fire!

[Chorus]
