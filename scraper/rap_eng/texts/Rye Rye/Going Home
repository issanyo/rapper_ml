[Hook]
Moving out, moving out of here
Keep your body moving, come on and keep it real
Moving out, moving out of here
(You walk on the subway)
Come on and keep it real
Moving out, moving out of here
Keep your body moving, come on and keep it real
Moving out, moving out of here
Keep your body moving, come on and keep it real

[Interlude]
This is a song for the genius child (Ooh)
Sing it softly for the song is wild
Sing this as ever you can
If that's a song get out of hand

[Hook]
Moving out, moving out of here
Keep your body moving, come on and keep it real
Moving out, moving out of here
Keep your body moving, come on and keep it real
Moving out, moving out of here
Keep your body moving, come on and keep it real

[Outro]
Moving out, moving out of here (Upon me)
Yo, yo, dance your pain away (Keep your body moving, come on and keep it real)
From the wildflower, ain't no' ting to me
(Everybody's dancing, sing the song)
Dance your pain away
Dance your pain away
(Hi is Mom home?)
(No, just called you t' tell you I'm okay and shit)
(Bye)
