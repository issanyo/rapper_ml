I got my eyes on the prize
And I'm ready to cash it in
Which dude wanna be my win
I'm lookin' for a naughty friend
They don't mind me partyin'
And he's so hot, Tamale'n
Show off no cardigan
And you can meet me in my bedroom, baby
As long as you know how to drive a girl crazy
You'll be Donald, I'll be Daisy
Gotta put in work can't be lazy!
And when I feel that heat it's on
We freakin' all night long
And when the music come on, you be jumpin' of strong inside

[Hook]
Boom boom boom
I want you in my room
Let's spend the night together
I wanna be with you
Boom boom boom
I want you in my room
Lets make this last forever
Just me and you together
Boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom
Boom boom boom

I get, I get, I get tingles when I see that boy
So hot he can be my toy
And we won't get real wild and play all night to the early morn'
All the little things just turn me on
Take me to the crib we can watch some porn
Or we can lay in the grass and sit and watch the sky, cause tonight real love was born
Late hours, candle light, that's the way you like it, right
A little bit of sugar, a little bit of spice
That's the shit that keep ya' hype
Pleasure pain sweet and sass,On and On make it last
And I don't wanna be a Bonnie and Clyde
AIIGHT

Come and squeeze me, come and kiss me
Come and squeeze me, come and kiss me
Come and squeeze me, come and kiss me, put your hand up on my cheek
Hold me tight, and don't let go, your loving got me feelin' weak
Blow my high, and you're so sweet, takin' all my energy
And I wanna boom boom boom
And I wanna boom boom boom
Like a video game PS 3
Come on over let's plug and play
Every girl got a freaky side, who gives a fuck what they say?
Give it to me baby like ah, ah
Everybody fuckin' to that rye rye
Boom boom boom, bitch, blah, blah, blah
