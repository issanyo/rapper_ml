Hola, yo ma, I'm on the east side cooler with my chola
Now we're at the bar granola
Hit the any with the cherry tree cola
Hey let's get closer
Turn around, spread it out, yogurt
Make the kids turn rock, bolder
Bang bang we will Yoda

Call it out, tip it up
Keep that drink up in my cup
Call it out, tip it up
Keep that drink up in my cup

Call it out, tip it up
Keep that drink up in my cup
Call it out, tip it up
Keep that drink up in my cup

No chasing
Who wanna roll a hundred spoke, date is

Two chicks on my lap, scraping

With her back she stack Lego
Play with your g string, cello
Cherry key chick called me long fellow
Hit her with the stick, now she call me donatello

Call it out, tip it up
Keep that drink up in my cup
Call it out, tip it up
Keep that drink up in my cup

Call it out, tip it up
Keep that drink up in my cup
Call it out, tip it up
Keep that drink up in my cup
