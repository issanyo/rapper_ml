Yo, yo, yo
(Ow!)
Yeah, I had to flip this here
Back over see some [?] this
Por favor, I'm on some other type stuff
Tell me what it is, do the boys get tough?
'Cus y'all know I get 'em in line
Everyone shit on the Rye Rye time
And hittin [?] cookies 'cus I'm on my climb
The Frenchies, uh, have some chills up my spine

To-to-to-to-to-to dance
Get our hands up and meet the chicks up France
And yeah I party down like ants in my pants
But people's gonna go there to find romance
If you cool, then chills, I might hang
But you gotta buy a lot, make the people go bang
You can do it, put your back into it
(My party goin' down, says fuck the music)

Hi, this is [?]
Make me wanna lounge in the party, bring me
Smoke, and get party boy basted
