[Chorus:]
Rock off shake off rock off shake
Rock off shake off shake shake
Now Rock off shake off rock off shake
Rock off shake off shake shake
Everywhere I wander and
Eyes I saw my risin' sun
And now that everyone was fast asleep to my sound
Sound, sound
Sound, sound
Sound, sound
Sound, sound
Bass, Bass
Bass, Bass
Bass, Bass
Bass, Bass

[Verse 1:]
We got big things dropping, little things poppin'
Rye Rye show 'em how it's done
I took a little trip to Europe
Never took a little trip to Spain
Now all you peeps get ready
'Cause Rye Rye is my name
I'm a drop it down once, beated up
Then Germany here speed it up
Always down for the crown fuck it up
Everybody in the place get pumped
Now rock off shake off rock off shake
Read my lips, Y'all can tell
Tonight is the night we ain't gonna' hate
Gettin' that breath on up that cane
I took a little trip to Europe
Never took a little trip to Spain
Now all you peeps get ready
'Cause Rye Rye is my name

[Chorus:]
Rock off shake off rock off shake
Rock off shake off shake shake
Now rock off shake off rock off shake
Rock off shake off shake shake
Everywhere I wander and
Eyes I saw my risin' sun
And now that everyone was fast asleep to my sound
Sound, sound
Sound, sound
Sound, sound
Sound, sound
Bass, Bass
Bass, Bass
Bass, Bass
Bass, Bass

[Verse 2:]
If you dang it with me, who else can see
Niggers wiling out, plus means and shit
Turn me to the night club later
Ladies beat it up, will work
Boombox ain't loud enough
Gotta go out just to get a while messed up
Vibration than my body ran
Hid my heart beat, and my insides scream
Yo yo now everybody get on the floor
Stop on the cross ring me and give me some more
Everybody get on the floor
Stop on the cross ring me and give me some more
Hey you never seen a dance like this, no
Got gangsters kickin' up dead cold
Mad deep with scar, it's no joke
Tried to sop up with the beat, it's no hope
Gotta go to the bathroom just to speed
Love gettin' dirty, wanna speak the speak
Ain't gonna share where I'm from
Now Fuck is up, don't be dumb
Fuck is up, don't be dumb
Fuck is up, don't be dumb
Fuck is up, don't be dumb
Don't be dumb
Don't be dumb

[Chorus:]
Rock off shake off rock off shake
Rock off shake off shake shake
Now rock off shake off rock off shake
Bass, Bass
Bass, Bass
Bass, Bass
Bass, Bass
Bass, Bass
Bass, Bass
Bass, Bass
Bass, Bass
Rock off shake off rock off shake
Rock off shake off shake shake
Rock off shake off rock off shake
Rock off shake off shake shake
