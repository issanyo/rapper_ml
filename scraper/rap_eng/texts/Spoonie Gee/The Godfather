[Intro]
'm the godfather
I'm the godfather
I'm the godfather
Of rap

[Verse 1]
Well let's get this straight, there's no contest
So now you people know don't have to guess
I'm not the king of rap, not lord, not prince
I was a young kid rappin', I've been rockin' ever since
I was just a young buck, I didn't care what
MCs were in my way they never uttered a but

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm the godfather
I'm the godfather

[Verse 2]
I caught silly young ladies, to just chill
They never said no to me - always say that they will do
Whenever I want them to - when I confront them to
Watch where you're walkin', or you just might bump into
I never rule them, I only school them
But if they ever try to fool me
That's when I fool them

[Chorus]
I'm the godfather
I'm the godfather

[Verse 3]
No time to be jealous, only to make money
I rap on stage, shake my butt for your honey
'Cause I'm rockin', and I'm a non-stoppin'
MC baby, who loves finger-poppin'
So don't diss me, just kiss me
If I ever have ya and leave, you're gonna miss me
I'm just a brother so what's up sis?
'Cause it's the pretty young ladies that make me talk like this

[Chorus]
Yes I'm the godfather
I'm the godfather

[Verse 4]
They say that I'm an MC, some say that I'm a poet
I changed my style people just didn't know it yet
I had to tell them I might [?] 'em
You mess with me and both of your eyes I swell them
[?] like Al Capone, I'm 'bout to take charge
Got [?] and new car in my garage
All the ladies want to cruise me, they don't move me
See my bankroll they want to try to use me
But I'm no fool never losin' my cool
But for me to undress I make the young ladies drool
I'm not braggin' tellin' you what I'm about
Young ladies no babies and marriage is out
But if you insist, you can come get this
Your house or mine, night or day we'll be fine
So let's get with it, so that I can hit it
In an hour or two me and you can just quit it

[Chorus]
I'm the godfather
I'm the godfather

[Verse 5]
Now the beat will be smokin' when the fire is out
So take your hand off your hips and baby let's work out
No leanin' on the wall, no standin' around
So are you ready (for what ?!) for the beat in me now
Because people come and see me, some people want to be me
Pretty young ladies wanna L-U-V me
The beat so bad that at 9 o'clock
In the morning if you play it they'll call the cops

[Chorus]
Yes I'm the godfather
Yes I'm the godfather

[Verse 6]
You got rockin' beats, non-stoppin' beats
Some records even have finger-poppin' beats
Always rappin' on time, Gemini is my sign
I'm so deep that's why I keep all the girlies on mine
I'm a fanatic at this, I'm at the top of the list
Stay cool, don't break the rules unless you wanna get dissed
Respect me while I'm rappin' on a record or show
You could stare, cause I don't care just as long you know

[Chorus]
That I'm the godfather
Yes I'm the godfather

[Verse 7]
Now you'll be jumpin', your heart'll be thumpin'
Place'll be rockin', sweat'll be poppin'
Off your face, all over the place
Easy Lee spin the records at a steady pace
Don't stand around, your face holdin' a frown
This is the season, no reason you can't get down
So get off the wall, let's have a ball
Boogie down to the beat just give it your all
No need to get high just have money to spend
So you can have a good time because it's within

[Outro]
'Cause I'm the godfather
Yes I'm the godfather
Of rap
