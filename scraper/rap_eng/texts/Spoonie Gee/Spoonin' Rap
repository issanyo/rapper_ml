(Intro)
You say
One for the treble
Two for the time
Come on, y'all, let's rock the -

( *whistle* )

Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
Funky beats, y'all
Then you rock 'n roll
Then you roll 'n rock
And they you rockin to the beat that just don't want you to stop
Cause I'm the S to the P-double O-N-Y
The one MC who you can't deny
Cause I'm the baby-maker, I'm the woman-taker
I'm the cold-crushin lover, the heartbreaker
So come on, fly girls, and please don't stop
Cause I'm MC Spoonie Gee, wanna hit the top
And young ladies, rock on

Say I was drivin down the street on a stormy night
Say up ahead there was this terrible fright
There was a big fine lady, she was crossin the street
She had a box with the disco beat
So I hit my brakes, but they're not all there
I missed the young lady by only a hair
And then I took me a look, I said, "La-di-da-di"
A big fine girl, she had a hell of a body
Then she looked at me and then she started switchin
So I took my key out of the ignition
Got out the car and kept my mouth shut
Cause my 20-20 vision was right on her butt
I caught up with her, I said, "You look so fine
I swear to God I wish you was mine"
She said, "Hey boy, you're Spoonie Gee"
"That's right, honey, how did you know me?"
She said, "Spoonie Gee, you're all the same
And everybody who disco know your name"
I said, "Come on baby, it's not too far
We gonna take a little walk to my car"
Once we got to the car, then we sat in the seat
And then the box was rockin to the funky beat
And then I looked at her and pushed the seat back
Turned off her box and put on my 8-track
And then I started rappin without no pause
Cause my mind was just gettin in those draws
And then I got in the straw, we started do it to the beat
And started doin like this, started doin the freak

Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
Cause I'm MC Spoonie Gee, I wanna be known
As the metropolitician of the microphone
Cause I'm a man's threat
And I'm a woman's pet
And I'm known as the mamsel's joy
And I'm a man who fights on the microphone
And who all the people enjoy, y'all
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on

Say I was breakin and freakin at a disco place
I met a fine girl, she had a pretty face
And then she took me home, you say, "The very same night?"
The girl was on and she was outta sight
And then I got the girl for three hours straight
But I had to go to work, so I couldn't be late
I said, "Where's your man?" she said, "He's in jail"
I said, "Come on baby, cause you're tellin a tale
Cause if he comes at me and then he wants to fight
See I'mma get the man good and I'mma get him right
See I'mma roll my barrel and keep the bullets still
And when I shoot my shot, I'm gonna shoot to kill
Cause I'm the Spoonie-Spoon, I don't mess around
I drop a man where he stand right into the ground
You say from Africa to France, say to Germany
Because you can't get a man tryin to mess with me
Cause I'm a smooth talker, I'm the midnight stalker
I'm the image of the man they call the J.D. Walker
If you're gonna be my girl, just come along
And just clap your hands to my funky song
I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't gamble neither
And most people call me a woman pleaser
Cause I keep their phone numbers on the shelf
I go to make love, and then keep it to myself
So no one's gonna know what I'm doin to you
Not your sister, brother, niece, nor your mother, father too"

And take that y'all
And don't stop
You keep on and on and on and on
Like hot butter on say what, the popcorn
Young ladies rock on
Fly guys
What a big surprise
Cause I'm MC Spoonie Gee, don't take no mess
From the north, the south, from east or west
Cause everybody knows MC Spoonie Gee's the best
Young ladies rock on, y'all
Rock, rock, y'all and don't stop
Keep on to the shill shot
And then you rock and roll
And then you roll and rock
And then you rock to the beat that just don't wantcha to stop
Cause I'm the S to the p-double o-n-y g
I'm talkin about me, MC Spoonie Gee
Rock on, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on to the shill shot
Rock on and on and on and on
Like hot butter on say what, the popcorn
Don't stop the funky beat till the break of dawn
Young ladies
Young ladies

Cause I'm the cool-crushin lover, goes on to supreme
And when it comes to fine girls I'm like a lovin machine
It comes to makin love, I do the best I can
Cause I'm known from coast to coast as the sixty-minute man
It comes to makin face, I got the macho class
I have all the fly girls shakin their ass
So for all you fly girls who wanna be loved
Check me out, cause I'm the highest above
I'm gonna call you up and give you an invitation
So you can see the way Spoonie Gee rocks the nation
One time, for the mind, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
Funky freaks, y'all
Yo go hip - hop - a hip-hip a hop
And then you're rockin to the hip, and then you're rockin the hop
And then you on and on and on and on
The beat don't stop until the freaks are gone
And rock on y'all, and don't stop
Keep on to the shill shot

And for you sucker-sucker dudes who commit a crime
You wanna do bad, but don't do the time
I say you wanna be dissed and then you wanna be a crook
You find a old lady, take her pocketbook
And then you steal your mother's borrowed money on the sly
You can run, but you can't hide
When the cops crashed through, your face turned pale
I'mma tell you a little story about the jail
Cause see, in jail there's a game and it's called survival
And they run it down to you on your first arrival
They tell you what you can and cannot do
But if you go to jail, watch yours for a crew
Cause when you go in the shower, he's pullin his meat
And he's lookin at you and say you look real sweet
And at first there was one, now ten walked in
Now how in the hell did you expect to win?
I said you better look alive, not like you take dope
And please my brother, don't drop the soap
And if you get out the bathroom, and you're alive
Just remember only a man can survive
In jail of course, cause when you're doin 15 years
You got no voice, you just have a warden
You never gets no chance, you're bound to turn a corner
?????

Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on to shill shot
Like a lime to a lemon and a lemon to a lime
I keep the funky beat, to say I pass the time
And like lemon and lime and like a lime to a lemon
A MC could attract all the women
Cause I'm Spoonie Gee, and I wanna be known
As the metropolitician of the microphone
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
So just clap your hands and just stomp your feet
And just rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
To the funky, funky, funky, funky beat
The beat that makes you get up and pat your feet
Young ladies rock on, y'all
Rock on, y'all
Till the break of dawn
I say you do the Spank or the Patty Duke
Either one you want, you gotta get up and do
The rock-rock and you don't stop
I say I jumped the turnstyle for summer day
And then I seen the guy, and then I fled away
And then he pulled his gun, but he did not shoot
So come on everybody, let's Patty Duke
Cause I'm livin well, and I'm ready to dance
Come on girl, let me show my romance
I'll let you see the way how I rock the mic
Cause I know damn well that I could rock all night
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on, y'all
You go rock and roll
And then you roll and rock..
