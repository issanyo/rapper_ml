[ VERSE 1 ]
Now you called my house and you said "come over"
Your mother and your father are gone, and you're alone with Rover
Your dog, but now you're frontin
You said if I come you'd give me somethin
So don't start playin around, cause I'm serious
Girl, what did you call me for, cause I'm curious
Now did you call me just to look in my face
Now I know I ain't come just to take up space
Because the night is right, and the stars are bright
So come on, soul sister, why don't you do right
And just take if off, I mean everything
Hurry up, pretty mama, so that we can swing
Now I don't smoke, and I don't get high
But if I say I don't love, well, that would be a lie
Cause I do every chance I get
But if I don't, I won't fall, I won't fret
Cause I'm no fool, I got plenty of sense
So I'll just be cool and have patience
So when you make up your mind, please let me know
Cause when you give me the green, that's when i'll go
So please, pretty mama, don't hesitate
And entice me nice and cooperate
Now you tried the rest, now try the best
But when time come, girls, don't you fess
And just take it off, and I mean it all
Cause I'm big time, baby, and I ain't small
Now undo your hair, untie your shoe lace
And after you finished, I want you to face
Me, now baby, don't get scared
Cause I'm not like the other guys, so don't compare
Me, tender loving care's all I give
And if possible, girl, well, I would like to live
With you, but if I do it ain't everybody's business
Secretly is just how we got into this
So take it off, cause I'm ready to rock
And like ??? baby, until the last drop
Cruisin down the street in my SL
When I peeped this girl who was built very well
Her face was beautiful, body was fine
Well, how did I know? Cause I was cruisin behind
Her, looked at my car, looked at me
Then she asked me my name, I told the girl Spoonie Gee
But I didn't wanna out-play my hand
So I talked so that she could understand
Me, she was definitely the move
I only said sweet things that would soothe
Her, opened up the door, and she got in
And automatically my mind just turned to sin
I told her: "Take it off!"

Now I met this girl at Amusement Park
She was good to go and it was after dark
But you can guess, fellas, what was on my mind
Let's go under the boardwalk and have a good time
Baby, instead the girl asked me my sign
And I said, "Why?" and she said, "Never mind"
Cause when the time comin it's you I'm thinkin of
A sign will make a difference on how you make love
To me you make me feel so good as a man
Ooh baby, you're sweet as cotton can-
-dy, if I could predict the rest of my life
I'd be a millionaire and you'd be my wife
So let's take a ride through the tunnel of love
Because you know what I'm thinkin of
Come on, baby, just take it off

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now I met this girl on the French Riviera
She said, "Spoonie Gee, I'm gonna go wherever
You go, when you're on tour or when you're chillin
Cause if you're able, Spoonie Gee, I'm willin"
I said, "Pretty mama, that's okay with me
So pass a glass and we'll sip Chablis
And in a half hour you'll be emblissed
When I give you a big french kiss
And then you wanna take it off"
