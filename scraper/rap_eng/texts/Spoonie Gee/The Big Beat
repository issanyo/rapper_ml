[Spoonie Gee]
Okay, bye
[Female]
Bye

It's comin' girl, don't be surprised
It's gonna make your nature rise
Whether you're mean or if you're sweet
This you won't resist, it's the big beat

And now I've been told it's good as gold
You can feel it way deep down in your soul
It's a funky sound, it's world-renowned
So c'mon girl, let's get on down
Gotta do it right, whether day or night
Ya gotta rock to the beat with all your might
The moment has come for you to meet
Whatever makes your body move, it's the big beat

It's the big beat

Now it's plain to see that it's meant to be
For you and me in ecstasy
Passion and pain, but lot to gain
And the way ya are I hope you'll remain
With sex appeal too good to be real
And it's your heart I want to steal
So take this chance, do this dance
Who knows it just might lead to romance
I hope it do, cause I want it do
Ooh girl, I wanna rock with you to the big beat

It's the big beat

I know other guys have copped a plea
But please girl have mercy on me
Let me take you out, let's wine and dine
Small cafe with food and wine
Chandelier for show, where the lights are low
If you don't like that well we can go disco
Boogie down, get drenched in sweat
From a good time this you can bet
So come on girl let's make the move
So that you and me can groove to the big beat

Freak this

Ahh, it's the big beat

It's the big beat

C'mon, just move your body (Shake!)
C'mon, move your body (Twist!)
Just move your body, just shake and twist
But allow me to ask you this
Do you like it in the morning? (Yeah!)
Late at night? (Yeah!)
Well you know what you can do babe when I'm through
And I'll make everything alright
Now is it funky (Yeah!)
Do you think it's bad (Yeah!)
Girl is it good [?] for ya?
That's right girl, the best you ever had
It's the big beat

It's the big beat

Let's ride around this fancy town
In a sports Mercedes with the top down
Shines so tough you can see your face
Light blue outside with the dark blue lace
Sheep-skin seats as bad as can be
Telephone in case of an emergency
So call me up, don't hesitate
Just tell me what time and I won't be late
Come cruising through, to pick up you
And to ring your bell one time or two
Or maybe three so you can creep me
And start the night like it's supposed to be
So make up your mind, don't waste time
And don't give me one of those so-so lines
About I want to, but I don't know
I got nothing to wear therefore I can't go
Cause if you really want to, you know you will
So c'mon girl, it's no time to kill
Just tell me now so I can show you how
I do, it feels good to you, it's the big beat

It's the big beat

Now you know what I need and you know what I want
So c'mon girl, don't try to front
Don't tell me you do when you know you don't
Don't say that you will when you know you won't
Don't build me up just to let me down
Don't turn my smile into a frown
If I'm wasting time, please tell me now
If there's a way, I'd like to know how
To make your body move all about
C'mon girl, let's work it out
To the big beat

It's the big beat

Now it could be your best if you say yes
But if you say no well you just go
The night on the town, chance to get down
To do your thing to this brand new sound
To get real loose with me as your boost
To relax to the max and sip martinis
Lancers, Moet or Piper too
Whatever you want, girl it depends on you
But first hang your coat, then ya wet your throat
Then we're gonna do what ain't no joke
Because Whether you're mean or if you're sweet
(Uh) This you won't resist, it's the big beat

This you can't resist, it's the big beat

This you better not miss, it's the big beat

Just talk about, it's the big beat

Ooh girl, gonna make you scream and shout, it's the big beat

It's the big beat

It's the big beat

It's the big beat

It's the big beat

It's the big beat
