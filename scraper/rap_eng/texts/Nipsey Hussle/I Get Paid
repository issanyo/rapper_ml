[Into: Nipsey Hussle]
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Fresh out the mystery from madness
Still rolling kush in them backwoods
Still burning holes in them mattresses
Still down to shoot at the -
I live my life in the rearview
Promise don't ever go backwards
Rep from the fronts to the backers
Don't put no trust in no [reverse]
They don't wanna see us establish
Checking us out of our masters
Imma start acting like Francis
Stallion blood all on your mattress
Millions all on my taxes
Nobody gave me no answers
I've been missing sitting in class
Fuck was you teaching the black kids?
I could've never imagined, all of these levels we passing
Know that shit locked cause I did, open my eyes made it happen
I could've never imagined, all of these levels we passing
Know that shit locked cause I did, open my eyes made it happen

[Hook]
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid

[Verse 2: J Stone]
West coast, gotta love it
Born and raised out the gutter
Came from the bottom of it
Nigga I was tired of stuggling
No more days of riding buckets, doe doe blaze and I done puffed it
Lowrider blue and chrome, two phones I done done it
Jaguar roof gone, new clothes riding rugged
Listening to my new song, yeah I probably gotta club it
I can teach you how to cut it, how to make the profit double
How to load it, how to bust it, J Stone hot as oven
Not to mention I spit pimping, proposition gotta listen
Dirty like the pots in kitchens, four 'lacs, tops missing
Dope tracks, not syringes, come and visit how i'm living
Houses and apartment buildings, all got the projects in them
We all got exotic women, baby mommas father children
Crazy drama robbing, killing, niggas rocking Dodger fitteds
Daytonas spinning, nigga, riding on them chrome wheels
Kush got me spinning higher than a phone bill
Bitch i'm getting paid

[Hook]
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid

[Verse 3: G.I. Joe]
They call me, G-I J-O, pay me cause I say so
Rather it be rap money, flocking or them quaaludes
Bank rolls and beemers mandatory when you're this on
Pat wine and ruby red, I gotta get my sip on
Bad bitch in mac lips I gotta get my dick on
Blue hundred dollar bills, Aye Nip I gotta get my crip on
Don't I walk like a gang of money? Talk like a gang of money?
Talk like I got it too? Sagging when i'm in these streets and i'm with a bunch of goons
The killers and gorillas the only niggas that I hang with
Slauson Ave, S-hat bangers who I bang with
Grab the microphone and I get paid to spit the same shit
Walk inside the club, we hella chunky bitch we gang thick
O.M.G. the brand, bitch and i'm sure you heard about it
I ain't showing up unless it's money or the bank deposits
What you think we grinded all this time to walk away with nothing?
Bitch stop playing with my money, let me hold something, yeah

[Hook]
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid
