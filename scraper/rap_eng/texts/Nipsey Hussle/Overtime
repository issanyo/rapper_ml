[Intro: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Gotta light up to shit like this, nigga
And I ain't even said it, or wrote it yet
I just feel it, you know?

Overtime, cause I ain't have a mic
I was in that Chevy..

[Hook: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Overtime, cause I ain't have a mic
I was in that Chevy playin' Savage Life
Niggas lookin' like I had it wrong
Now them niggas know I had it right
They don't know about them sleepless nights
Them lookin' for a reason nights
They say it's six degrees in life
Opportunity, preparation, made me this nice

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hu$$le]
You see me up in Neiman's, right?
My chain and my pinkie bright
I valet this Mercedes Benz
Lookin' like, somebody that people like
Can't but help to think how fake it is
This world and this music biz
I just want all of this paper, though
So maybe I can try and change the shit
Maybe, me, I'm too ambitious
Or maybe this a new dimension
Maybe them, they too religious
Maybe they judge my intentions
But either way, I'm on my mission
In the sky, for our love, I'mma tie a ribbon
Life's a bitch, lady luck my woman
Forever you my lady, I'm your fuckin' nigga

[Hook: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Overtime, cause I ain't have a mic
I was in that Chevy playin' Savage Life
Niggas lookin' like I had it wrong
Now them niggas know I had it right
They don't know about them sleepless nights
Them lookin' for a reason nights
They say it's six degrees in life
Opportunity, preparation, made me this nice

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Cappin' for a cheaper price
Hustlin' for a bucket, keep your sneakers tight
Shoot a box, catch the cheapest flight
If it land, thank you Jesus Christ
You ain't gon' get it till you see it right
And jump off in this legal life
Feel the pressure from your people, right?
Still choose to lead 'em right
Sometimes I rap about my feature price
Or all of my defeats in life
They told me don't believe the hype
But I felt like this 'bout myself before the mic
