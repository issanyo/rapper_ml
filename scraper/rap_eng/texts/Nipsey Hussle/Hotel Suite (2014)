(Intro)
All that
Yea, but really

(Verse)
I just got this dough in my pocket, the hoes that be jockin'
This weight on my shoulder, all these clothes in my closet
V12 engines, beautiful women
This life is a blast nigga when you the one winnin'
Liquor in my kidneys, yac when I’m sippin'
Black Escalade, with all of my niggas
Calls from them prisons, from careless decisions
Tryin' to upgrade yo livin', tryna spin off yo pivot
I relate though my nigga, so I shoot you that green dot
We fucking these bitches, 2013 Aaliyahs
We fly to these countries in 501 Levi’s
I’m so west side nigga, arriba arriba
These niggas be hatin', but really I see why
Hundred a show, so gas up the G5
That’s one of my goals nigga, know I complete mine
I think it, I do it
It’s part of my design

(Hook)
Yea, in a hotel suite, with a famous freak
Yea, told her do her thing, she ain’t even blink
Uh, took her off her feet, put her on that sink
Aye, everything by choice, but she came for me
Look, so I got that flight you should probably chief
Yea, shots of Patron make yo body weak
Look, and I ain't gon stop til we fuck up yo sheets
Look, then I wake you up and just fuck up yo sleep

(Verse)
Young nigga with no conscience, corporate cards in my wallet
Bitches tell me I’m awesome, I’m like duh bitch, I’m on Slauson
Life’s short, there’s no promise
Party hard like New Orleans
Crack a pint and then pour it, but I don’t ever start snoring
Foot to gas, I keep floorin'
Stop lookin', that could be yours
I just wrote a fuckin' book it's the taking  money, thesaurus
All I know is get more, all I know is just flourish
Started off on that porridge
Now it's shrimp tempura
Crab and lobster on Collins
Niggas all skipped college
Ended up as them bosses, all I know is we poppin'
All I know is I got it
TMC, that’s my logic
Marathon, ain’t no stoppin'
That’s the way I get all this
Los Angeles royal shit, county jail Top Ram shit
Court tank, gang brawl shit
Smoking, smellin like dog shit
Have you feeling like aw shit, I gotta go home, I gotta get up out
Then you scratch yo head, tryna find a route, you gotta figure it out
Gotta buy a Benz, buy a house
Stay confident while you try it out
Really do this type of shit that these rappin niggas be lyin bout
Be lyin bout, they trickin hoes, they flyin out
Bitch just call me like come through
I’m like yea boo, I’m bout to wear you out

(Hook)
Yea, in a hotel suite, with a famous freak
Yea, told her do her thing, she ain’t even blink
Uh, took her off her feet, put her on that sink
Aye, everything by choice, but she came for me
Look, so I got that flight we should probably chief
Yea, shots of Patron make yo body weak
Look, and I ain’t gon stop til we fuck up yo sheets
Look, then I wake you up and just fuck up yo sleep

All money in, no money out
