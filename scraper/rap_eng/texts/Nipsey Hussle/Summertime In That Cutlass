[Intro]

Yeah
Some LA shit
Crenshaw and Slauson
Young niggas getting money for real this time

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]

Look
Summertime in that Cutlass, all these young hoes is fuckin
All these young niggas is hustling, pull up thick to that function
Pull out guns and start bussin, cuz niggas not with no fussin
Roll up kush and shoot hunnids, and take yo bitch like its nothing
We was living fast we was rushin, niggas burnt and crashed on that dumb shit
And it was fuckin sad cuz we was puppets, had to learn so fast to switch hustles
And my bag, that’s $1200, and my fucking pad is illustrious
And I’d still kill one of you niggas, cuz I’m not really for the fuck shit

Super Sports and boxed Cutlass, and pull off fast and burn rubber
Pull out cash like it’s nothing, cuz all these young niggas is hustling
All these young hoes his fuckin, summertime in that Cutlass

Handouts it was no such, ten toes in some old chucks
Beat loud but I’m lowcut, European clip grill when I roll up
Oh fat Rollie all gold huh? Let me squeeze ten shots that’d be yo luck
Look, talk money or I’m deaf, see niggas going broke that ain't nothing to respect
And I ain't tryna feel it so I do it to the death, 1985 Cut dawg in the set
When I was fuckin Courtney and Lauren, they was neighbors
And Car-car told both of em she was hatin
But I ain't give a fuck, I been a young player
Push foreign shit now but remember them days when I used to spend a
