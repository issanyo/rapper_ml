[Intro: Kree]
In Californication

[Verse 1: David Banner & Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, bitch I'm from the country but that don’t make a nigga soft
Big city niggas come south and get their wigs knocked off (yeah!)
Me, I just hustle and flow
Find a track, start and pimp on a ho
The block got hot, a nigga had to get low
Get the fuck out of dodge and hit my uncle on the Westside
Trevon (Whattup neph? What's cracking?)
I wanna visit L.A., I'm already packed
Been already stacking so we gonna get turned up
Soon as you land, purple kush gon' get burnt up
Shit, the next day I'm at LAX
Uncle Trey pulled up in a Camaro SS
Black on black, sitting on 23s
Bumping Rich Boy like bitch "Throw Some D's"
Two bad bitches in the back seat, one of them for me
Mexican mami named Marie
Rolling up some trees on the 105 East
Roll down the window, just to feel the breeze
It's real nice, feeling like paradise (fo'sheesh)
And all I can see is sunshine and palm trees

[Hook: Kree]
Welcome to Californication
Welcome to Californication

[Verse 2: David Banner, Snoop Dogg & Ras Kass]
Where we going? (To the hood) naw I wanna see the swap meet
Crenshaw and Slauson (fool, that's where the cops be)
Nigga, I ain't got no driver's license or insurance
Sure enough the cops pulled us over on Torrance
"Everybody out the car", the cops set us on the curve
They searched the ashtray and found a roach full of herbs
What's this in that cigar? Medical marijuana officer
I got a weed card, what condition you smoke weed for?
Trevon Jones, place your hands behind your back
You're under arrest for warrants go to court in Torrance
Monday, Monday? It's Wednesday man!
Or maybe Tuesday (that's some bullshit) you heard me ma’am
Now if you keep it up, I'll arrest you for obstruction of justice
Trey like, "Take the car, fuck this"
Have fun, call my homies, go clubbing with your dumb ass
At least they ain't found my gun stash

[Hook: Kree]
Welcome to Californication
You might come for vacation
Welcome to Californication
But you might leave on probation, I'm telling you now
Welcome to Californication
Everyone knows, anything goes
Welcome to Californication
In Californication

[Verse 3: David Banner, Nipsey Hussle & Snoop Dogg]
I dropped the bitches off now I'm off to my uncle house
Stopped by the liquor store, nothing but the thugs out
White tees and Chucks when nigga hit me up like
(Ay ay, where you from homie?) Lifted up his shirt on me
Chrome .4-5, and dawg I wasn't strapped
And another walked up like (Nah, he cool, that's Dave Black)
Trey Lo folks, visiting from Mississippi
Passed the pint of Hennessey (here, sip this with me)
I'm Javon, we're gon' get it popping tonight
Wassup? (Hollywood 'round here, these niggas flocking tonight)
What's flocking? (Breaking in homes)
B and E, burglary nigga, damn you slow
Oh we kicked it in the hood drinking, smoking kush, twist up
Hood rat with the big butt shows up, got my dick sucked
Kissed my auntie on the cheek, see you later
Now we five niggas deep in Javon's Navigator
The club's off the chain, I'm seeing models and stars
NBA players straight buying out bars
The state of Arizona tryna segragate
But my dick don't discriminate, black girls, white girls
Pimping, I just like girls
California girls, Katy Perry dyke girls
Met an Asian with fake tits next to a hype girl
She took a powder brand, sniffing on that white girl
V.I.P bottles and all that
Then some random nigga started pouring out cognac
I said, "Pimpin what you doin’?" He said, "Fuck you too" (what the fuck?)
And that’s the last thing he did (ay, ay get that nigga bro!)
I took a bottle and I cracked that nigga, smacked that nigga
Security rushed me like, "Arrest that nigga"
Tearing up the club, all five of us
Asian bitch grab me like, "Hurry up, slide with us"
But the cops were outside, stopped her, detained me
Found some coke in her purse, motherfuckers blame me
Next thing you know I'm in the county jail
I walked in the cell, my uncle Tray is right there
Yeah, and he's just shaking his head
Then he laughed at a nigga (don't pee in the bed)
Don't let the bright lights fool ya, L.A. a trippy place
It's been 24 hours I just caught my first case, damn!

[Bridge: Kree]
I’m just here to see the Hollywood sign got locked up
Niggas doin’ crazy drive-by's, get popped up
Esé tripping on me for no reason
Jail politics, killin' niggas in season

[Hook: Kree]
Welcome to Californication
You might come for vacation
Welcome to Californication
But you might leave on probation, I'm telling you now
Welcome to Californication
Everyone knows, anything goes
Welcome to Californication
In Californication

[Outro: Game]
See California be like that sometimes
You see the palm trees, all on Venice Beach
You see the bright lights all on Hollywood
And you think it's all good right
You gettin' dressed, you ready to go out
You see some bad bitches
That same bad bitch'll set you the fuck up
You walkin' out the club from having a good time
Lightweight tipsy, 'fore you know it
You got a bag on your head and you in the back off a van
Goin' somewhere you ain't never been in your life
That's the reason why you got caught the fuck up right now
And you don't understand, shit about California
So next time you come out here
Maybe you should just a motherfucker, and ask
Los Scandalous
