They call me Young Nip C-Note, Rose Clicquot
Talking to my girl while your bitch give me deep throat
Shooting at the world dog cause life is just a free throw
Shopping on rodeo in some dickies that's my stee-lo
Played out pussy please don’t offer me no
If sex was a weapon she could not kill a mosquito
Little mama lost her grip pastrami around her pee hole
Got too many miles, baby that’s a repo
Shorty's in denial really tryna fuck with me though
I'm way out your league so please excuse my ego
Diamonds in my Cuban link my Rolex presidential
Penthouses and beach homes perrier and patron
Told you way before about this baller shit I be on
Young Nipsey Hussle ain't some shit that you should sleep on
Rich before rap had to let the streets go
Faith in my transition I know I’ll be back in beast mode
Catch a case that’s the tradition either that or six believe no
Still somehow I understood that I could make the seed grow
And that one day that tree will bear fruit to feed my people
That one day is a promise grab your fork it's time to eat bro
Slauson ave he's so rapper CEO
And if we're all actors I guess I'll be Al Pacino
And it was all after when they thought I was finito
Not my Valentino but that's what I got up my sleeve though
LAX to JFK then on our way to Heathrow
At the polo lounge in here sipping cappuccino
Spending pounds every purchase man this feeling has no equal
If you come from where I come from it's rare that you C4
That did it like I did it but do it ‘cause we need more
Cuba Gooding Juniors kill em with that submarine flow
Like every man of honor had to conquer Rob Deniro
Like Ginger in Casino or that runway light in Heat
That shadow in the grass from when Vincent shot him off his feet
In other words, life is just a fight against your disbelief
That's why I'm screaming I'm the greatest of all time like Young Ali
Played Mohammad to these thoughts, prophets in this industry
But I’m just me, catch me cruising solo in my 2CB
EMC or at the Roosevelt with Rimpau smoking weed TMZ
Flashing lights like Kanye album number three
But I’m gon' be from RSC 'til the day I D-I-E
So I crank my beat and hit the gas on 'em
