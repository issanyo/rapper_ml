[Verse 1]
When you pull out cars it's outrageous
Gotta pull out K's on these haters
Time flies and love changes
The best friends become strangers
Gang banger that got famous
Real nigga that won't trade it
Niggas hate but don't say shit
I don't fuck with that gay shit
I don't fuck with no favors
I just fuck with my paper
I just fuck her don't save her, bitch
Westside Neighbors, ball a nigga like you a Laker
But you started off on probation
Gotta stall you niggas say you changing
You don't fall, they call you a Freemason
But through it all you following your faith then
And your broad is everything but basic
Niggas pull out cars and miss payments
And when you pull out cards they make faces
Bitch ass niggas be hating
Bitch ass niggas ain't grateful
Bitch ass niggas ain't straight, huh?
You ol' bitch ass nigga you Satan

[Hook]
Real niggas that get rich
Gotta deal with shit like this
Real niggas that got paid
Gotta be a real nigga to your grave
So real niggas that get rich
Gon' feel shit like this
So real niggas that don't quit
Gotta deal with shit like this hold up
Real niggas that get rich
Gotta deal with shit like this
Real niggas that got paid
Gotta be a real nigga to your grave
So real niggas that get rich
Gon' feel shit like this
So real niggas that don't quit
Gotta deal with shit like this hold up
