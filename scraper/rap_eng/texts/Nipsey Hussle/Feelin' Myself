[Hook: Lloyd]
I'm I-I feelin' myself
I I-I I I-I I’m feelin; myself
I-I-I-I-I’m so fresh and I can’t help it
I’m so fresh and I can't help it

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hu$$le]
I used to wake up in the dope spot and turn my swag on
Wasn’t hopping out the bed, cause I was sleeping on the floor
Back then y'all was sleeping on the flow
Used to get it on the block I had to keep it on the low
My cash grow like pinnochio’s nose
Bulletproof, seven series, yeah we set em on fours
Out of every new nigga I’m the one the city chose
Now can’t a muthafucker knock me out my zone, and that's why

[Hook: Lloyd]

[Bridge: Nipsey Hu$$le]
And when they see me, me they like, like, like, like, like. (yeah)
I make the girls go (Oh oo Oh) go, go, go, go
And when I step in they see me they like, like, like, like. (yeah)
I make the girls go (Oh oo Oh) go, go

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Yes y'all, I got the money and respect y'all
You seen the movie so you know what's comes next y'all
The women, the power, the haters tryna catch ya’ll
The game ain't change, just the pieces on the chess board
Hottest on the West, Dollars to invest
Ex fella, still I got your kids college on my neck
They said it wouldn’t work, cause I'mma rider from the set
But being you pays on, you should try it for yourself
And that's why

[Hook: Lloyd]

[Bridge: Nipsey Hu$$le]

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hu$$le & Lloyd]
[Nipsey Hu$$le]
We’re standing on the couches, lighting up kush blunts
I'm the type of nigga that's gon’ take it if she look once
You the typa nigga that she gon’ have waiting for 2 months
For your head first base, I done scored 2 runs
Now ask some questions to clarify your view homes
First one being: “what type of shit is you on?”
It ain't my fault your girl got to choose home’s
Just blame it on the yellow gold Roley with the blue stones

[Lloyd]
So if you don’t need no help cause your feeling yourself somebody say
Yeah yoh yeah, Yeah yoh yeah
And if you know you so cool and its all about you let me hear you say
Yeah yoh yeah, Yeah yoh yeah

[Nipsey repeating]
Yes Yes Y'all..

Yes Yes Y'all..
