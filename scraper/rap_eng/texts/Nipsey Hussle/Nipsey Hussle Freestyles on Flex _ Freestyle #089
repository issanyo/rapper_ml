[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Bullying Scott blue tips like that Crippin nigga
Everything got 30 unit and I'm tripping nigga
Refrigerator cupholders when I'm sippin nigga fuck
Work sell words it was written igger
See the Staples Center from my kitchen nigga
On the phone with Forbes asking how I did it nigga
Snatched up girl it's official nigga
All he's been a man on the mission nigga
Yeah it's like a movie take the top off
By the crossover like con sauce
On these gutters shit I never hot dog
Most calculated move by far
Always with a model win a fly car
Yeah 30,000 foot of Python
Rocking the odds sipping white wine
Listen in there in my lifetime
In the night time
Looking at the city skyline
Getting sky-high
Took the little bitch to pop off
She was top five
Excitement that she get from pop life
Could never taught my
Once you get the hustle lock now
You can stop pal
Level up another notch now like a black now
Every time I take the top down
She arch her eyebrows
Turning up the music hot now
She feel alive now
Let me like we from a small town
Let's make them all around you splurge I'll splurge but
Later and we bar now

Nothing to say listen we realized it

When the crisis song said I die alone I
Said it's like football pork cuts will
Speak in hyperbole translation get the
Money never wait for her clipless for
Already where he go shoulder for already
Where he strike should go
These ponies got opinions how my life
Should go on screaming fucking Lakers
Suck a dick and die tonight you know
Bullets rain on them cut the life
Support my section ride for sport every
Night of course niggas dying every day

Spending thousands at the nicest stores

Ride shit come for me look grind I'm
Stuck in this ground
Stuck in this grind I'm stuck in this
Ground look me and my eyes caught me on
My loss stuck in this grind look nothing

We knew the outcome and we still trotted
That south central state of mind I'm in
The field logic to be a real writer

You ain't fill out us now this running
Cell your hands II hope these bills wash
It sinking deeper in regret nuts to
Braille faucet see everybody go for self
