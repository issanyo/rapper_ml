Pride of Milan
Back to the mall
Everything I got, I'm gonna give it all
Only one shot, so I'm goin' hard
Everything I got, I'm gonna give it all

Cause I could never I lose
I can I can never lose
I can I can never lose
I can I can never lose
I can I can never lose
I can I can never lose
I can I can never lose
I can I can never lose

Nah, nah
So if you want it then you gon' have it
If you believe it then it's gonna happen
And if you take it you don't gotta ask it
Just if you do it, be the best at it
At it, at it
Just if you do it, be the best at it
At it, at it
Just if you do it, be the best at it
At it, at it
Just if you do it, be the best at it

She's been around and round the world
And she ain't found nobody like me
Cause it on me it's inside me
She's been around and round the world
And she ain't found nobody like me
Cause it on me it's inside me

What's the difference between me and you?
See me, I got to win so I could never lose
What's the difference between me and you?
I'm number one, one, one, one, one
What's the difference between me and you?
See me, I got to win so I could never lose
What's the difference between me and you?
I'm number one, one, one, one, one
