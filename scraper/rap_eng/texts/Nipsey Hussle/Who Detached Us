[Verse 1:]
Look, somehow I escaped the fate of this life I lead
Divorced the street, she tried to kill me and my wife to be
Black widow, silk sheets and a satin pillow
This california king loved you like a sack of endo
Empty patron bottles and a pack of mentos
Master sweet frigerator full of incidentals
Every day we have a ball like the blond bimbo
Talk to her like a shrink and fuck her like a nympho
And it can be as simple as it seems
If you never doubt yourself and learn from everything you see
No wishing on a star can turn your life into a dream
You could walk on water just don't look down at your feet
Look, told this world I was a star I'm gonna need a stage
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say
When I was 12 a crazy lady told me lead the way
I shed a tear cause it was real, this water never straight
Now every second is a classic, when nothing last
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that
This world is turning faster and faster
Once you found the the real it's hard to tolerate the plastic

[Hook:]
I ain't no christian, ain't no catholic but
I believe god gonna shine his light on everyone and never ask shit
I need some answers to these questions that I'm asking
We used to be connected, who detached us
We used to be respected, now they laughing
We've turned into possessions with no passion
How we go from the best to less then average
We used to be connected, who detached us
With no collective identity, it's every man for himself
We need the black mafia

[Verse 2:]
Rutheless CRIP on some stupid shit
To valeting at Ruth Chris in some roofless shit
I think too much tv is what ruin kids
When homosexuals act as their influences
We need community centers that teach the music biz
That way we learn to retain ownership on some Jewish shit
Don't take your hand out, you build it it's more lucrative
And now everything that I spoke is the truest shit
You get abused long enough, you start abusing shit
She flipped the script and now your woman calling you a bitch
You got some problems in the house that only you can fix
And if you was a kid that grew up with it even you would split
He told the world he was a star and he gonna need a stage
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say
When he was 12 a crazy lady told lead the way
He she'd a tear cause it was real, this water never straight
Now every second is a classic, when nothing last
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that
This world is turning faster and faster
Once you found the real it's hard to tolerate the plastic

[Hook]
I ain't no christian, ain't no catholic but
I believe god gonna shine his light on everyone and never ask shit
I need some answers to these questions that I'm asking
We used to be connected, who detached us

[Steve Jobs]
Death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it
And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life
It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new
Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life
Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other peopleis thinking
Don't let the noise of otheris opinions drown out your own inner voice
And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary
Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish
It was their farewell message as they signed off...
And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you
Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish
