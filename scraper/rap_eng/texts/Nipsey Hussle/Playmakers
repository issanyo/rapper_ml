[Chorus: BH]
I remember, on the block, didn't have a way
I remember, on the block, that's why I'm making these plays
I remember, on the block, didn't have a way
I remember, on the block, that's why I'm making these plays
That's why I'm making these plays, I remember
So I'm making these plays, I remember (We the ones making the plays!)
That's why I'm making these plays, I remember
Making these plays, I remember
Young nigga getting paid!

[Verse 1: BH]
I built my house, started with a brick
Who'd think I would've built that shit
Young niggas, just tryna hit licks
Bad bitches, just tryna get hit
Me, I'm tryna get mo' dough
Yeah, pull up buy it cut for the low-low
Prolly swerve on your ass in the low-low
Yeah, Cut-Dog, nigga it's a two-do'
40 on my lap, 30 in the clip
Young nigga who you want that with
Not me, not me nigga
Young Hoggy, better have respect when you see me nigga
I left cheese on the trap for you rat niggas
I had to cut the grass nigga for you snake niggas
Had to stay away from all bitch niggas
Young Hoggy, he a real ass nigga

[Bridge: Buddy]
Niggas acting like they making the plays
But we the ones making the plays
And we don't be making mistakes
We do this all day, cause we the playmakers!
Oooh, playmakers! Yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
We the ones making the plays (Yeah, that's us nigga)
Squabbled in back of the cage (You remember, socking on you niggas taking your name)
Locked us inside of a cage (County jail shit nigga)
Treated just like we was slaves (Fuck that, bounce back on you niggas)
Had to climb out of my grave
100 to stand on the stage
My logo it hang from my chain (That's true, All Money In nigga)
The fuck you expect me to say
Call me Nip Hussle the Great
60th Street on my face (Neighborhood nigga, S-Gang)
3,000 square feet in my place (Walk through this bitch and hear the echo)
So when I wake up I say grace
For keeping me safe, cause we the ones making the plays!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
