(Intro: J.Y.)Theres no progress without sturggle
As they say
Its the game we play
I show you mine, J

(hook: Young Scolla) through our struggle, they must have thought that we failed
But we must struggle so they can't stop what we built
(we with it so that's why I tell em)
We all good
We ready for whatever
I swear to you we got it
Headed to the top and there's nobody who can stop it

(Verse 1: J.Y.) They say im outta here, so im all for it
A breath of fresh air, got sent into orbit
You try to sell to me this moment i wouldn't have bought it
I can't pay mind to haters I couldn't afford it/
Find a synonym for great when you look in thesaurus
You'll see my face I bet you smile when you look at my portrait
Was lookin' to forfeit, but i took it back
Blinded by how plans foil, that's how I look at rap/
But contrary to belied I was pushed to rap
Learning breath control at six holding my boogers back
Got introduced to Pete Rock that's when I got hooked to rap
15 years later Im buzzin' now would you look at that/
Ain't no lookin' back, I got my rhymes seasoned
And I got all yall attention for the time bein
So my minds even, ready for grind season
So im riding until the wheels get the decline treatment/

(Hook: Young Scolla)

(Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le) Now Im smoking on this overseas, Amsterdam shit
Kush weed, politicking trying to make my plans stick
Push me i'm too close to the edge i smash quick
I ain't that nigga thinkin' he gonna get a couple dollars and switch/
I ain't ya role model, i ain't on no positive shit
I'm on some by any means a nigga got to get rich
Ski mask schemes my team's only logic is this
Its only one way up to go and that's up outta this shit/
Could you believe they didn't see that I was the shit
Niggas slept I woke em up like an alarm after 6
Look im a hustler you can tell by the cars that I dip
Fully loaded extra features like the broads that I flip/
Its not a bar that Im gone spit, that's not a part of my script
You eyewitness ass niggas get arrested and snitch
Until you niggas looking at me like the lick with hit
Id tell you bout the last nigga but he rested in piss, look/

(Hook: Young Scolla)


(Verse 3: J.Y.) My minds roamin' free, I'm in the zone to be
One of the top spitters, thats on the coldest beats
So come and see the show, i hope they hold your seats
You left ya ticket home, you better show receipts/
If you should ever wonder, if the show is brief
Dead the worry out ya mind I can go for weeks
I can go for months, light up and roll the reef
Until God take my life and has my soul to keep/
So what you supposed to see, flows composed from me
Controlled vocally, death's what I propose for the, weak
Low key I bring the wolves out
And I never been shy, so throw that bull out/
My cribs full of hoes, never raw I pulls out
So like Jesse, I get Becky in that full house
Thats the life for me, but only I can see
I believe the only comp in my eyes is me/
