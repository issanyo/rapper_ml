[Intro: Kent Jamz]
I’m tired of fucking around
I ain’t crazy

[Verse 1: Kent Jamz]
Getting head, blowin' dro
[?]
Her friend said
"Fuck these niggas, I can’t trust these niggas"
Threesome on the bed, [?] on the floor
Your girl ran through the door, she screaming
"Fuck that nigga, I can’t trust that nigga, no mo’"
Now she gone let me hit it 'til the summer
Thanks for the come up
Ask her how it felt
She said yum yum
I told her [?]
Niggas need to grow up
Bitches need to slow down
Stop fucking niggas from the same town
Then act surprised when [?] merry go round
You where he go now
Buying swishers for his niggas
Smoking that loud, shutting your mouth
I should be proud
All I wanna do now is scream out
“I’m tired of fucking around”
But for now let the beat go down
She won’t frown when the weed go around

[Hook: Kent Jamz]
I’m tired of fucking around, with these niggas
I’m tired of fucking around, with these niggas
I’m tired of fucking around, with these niggas
I’m sick of playing with you
Fuck what you saying nigga, I ain’t crazy

[Verse 2: Joon]
I’m a wild-haired, skinny-boned
Tie-dye wearing ass nigga
Kush smoking mu'fucka
You may wanna ask your friend about
Right after you turn your shoulder to walkin' past
One dread, one bed
So why you gone give up that ass?
I got dest on dest on dest
Titties sleeping on top of my chest
I’m dropping the ashes on top of her neck
Straight dest respect
And these niggas ain't no different
I love 'em, all they my children
But they still could get these mittens
If they need to get it out they system
I’m ten toes sorry I don’t care about your feelings
All I care about is family and taking care of my little one
I know that I’m the shit, but hate when it’s being mentioned
But now I think its time to stop being nice to competition
Got my middle finger up, like your bitch is sitting down
And your group compared to us, is Cudi’s first single out
And I may be crazy, cause I only see in layman’s
And I ain’t giving up no anus, to get my anus famous

[Verse 3: P]
Old friends still talking cause they know my minds changed
And sometimes I tend to act quite insane
Like my girlfriend say
But I ain’t tripping off opinions from you niggas
Over D. Ounce the illest in the game
All you mickey niggas strange
Wonder why I don’t come kick it
You still up on that same shit from when you saw me different
Say you 'bout your bread, but you politicking like some bitches
Put progression in your vision
Ho nigga get out my business
Hating on your boys cause you [?]
So quick to blame your neighbor
Instead of looking in the mirror
Tired of fucking around with you niggas huh
But I still got pounds for you niggas
I be tripping but believe me, I ain’t crazy

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Nipsey Hussle]
I ain’t crazy, nah, far from it
All my life I’ve been hustling
Never had no access but always was constructive
Therefore I’m well versed in every subject
Had to put this shit together myself
Tired of fucking around
Big plans of me touching the clouds
But, quicksand had me stuck on the ground
Look, don’t dispute my untouchable style
Tt wasn’t a question if he got it
But, who would allow
This young nigga smoking weed
With his music up loud
To put his blue chucks on the scene
And give our city a sound
Shit like what's [?]
He untrustable now
Unfuckable now, Unbuckable now
I ain't tripping, self-made, just mo’ hustling now
?
Fuck the middle man, make millions thats the job, hustle

[Part 2: Kent Jamz]
Vogue
Model bullets in my magazine, watch me, bang bang bang
Model bullets in my magazine, watch me, bang bang ah
Model bullets in my magazine, watch me, bang bang bang
Model bullets in my magazine, watch me..

I pulled up to the [?] with four girls from the UK in an old school
They all been sniffing cocaine
One of 'em won’t stop licking my face
They don't even smoke weed

Bang bang bang
Bang bang bang
Bang bang bang
