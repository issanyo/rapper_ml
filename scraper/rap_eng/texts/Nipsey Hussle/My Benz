[Intro]
You remind me of my, hey

[Chorus]
When people try to play with me they end up with the lost
Most days I don’t never floss but that don’t mean cooling off
I got girls around the way and some places you get lost
Mixing different weed for one joint then taking off
Here we go

[Verse]
So strap in for your benefits
It’s mine I ain’t renting this
Open doors I’m a gentleman
If you see tint I’m tryna protect the innocent
So how you don’t care for me
If there is a ghetto in heaven save a chair for me
I want to do my verse for the kids to see
When I was your age I had big ass dreams
I would talk cars with my homeboy Phil
In the second grade I would thinking of wheels
It’s hard to ignore truth when it’s revealed
Old school new school, I’m tryna kill

[Hook]
She remind me of my Benz
She remind me of my Benz
She remind me of my Benz
She remind me of my

It’s enough to go around
It’s enough to go around
It’s enough to go around
You it’s a S class or something
Niggas be jet lagged from it
Cause she trained to go and she keep a little change of clothes

So strap in for your benefits
100 Gs what’s the differences
Stats on Emmitt Smith
Just one —? all through the whip
Real fly nigga that means you’re the stewardess
Come home at 1 smash 2 to 6
2018 gotta watch who you moving with
If you see me solo or with the crew that’s it

[Chorus]
When people try to play with me they end up with the lost
Most days I don’t never floss but that don’t mean cooling off
I got girls around the way and some places you get lost
Mixing different weed for one joint then taking off
Here we go

[Hook]
She remind me of my Benz
She remind me of my Benz
She remind me of my Benz
She remind me of my

[Outro: Nipsey Hussle]
Yeah, if I can teach you anything I’ll teach you how to stay down. Play your role. Stay in your lane. Know your position, all that

[Outro 2: Dom Kennedy]
It’s enough to go around
It’s enough to go around
It’s enough to go around
It’s enough to go around
It’s enough to go around
It’s enough to go around
You remind me of my Benz
You remind me of my Benz
You remind me of my Benz
You remind me of my
You remind me of my Benz
You remind me of my Benz
You remind me of my Benz
