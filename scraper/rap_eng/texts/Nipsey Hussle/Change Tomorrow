Whats your life like nigga minez 'great
I done made it out this right my cities crime rate
Every single rule niggggaaa thats what i break
Hit me like a omen seize the moment hussle why wait
One thing i never do is excercise hate
But im the illest nigga doin this in my state
Probably my country probably this world
Anywhere i see myself i bet i get there
If theres a thrown to be sat on i bet i sit there
If theres a crown to be worn i bet it fit yea
Call me king nip c note you niggazz is pussy
3 squares like C low
Blood suckin people like man made mosquitos
Once a month a nigga still gotta see my p.o
Had so many cars but i ain't never seen a repo
Leather seat flow sippin mile high mojitos
Before success is what comes after calico
Niggas chase fame like o.j and clicquot
Quick sand stance pay attention watchem sink slow
In retrospect 15 was like cinco
Seconds in the spot light and watchem walk off
Know you official when the referee is in fer you
And all your hip hop role models is startin to mention you
Resurrect the west im just doin what im meant to do
Two words then who? if it isnt dude ...
