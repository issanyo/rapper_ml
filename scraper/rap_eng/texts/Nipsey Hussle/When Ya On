[Intro: Chamillionaire]
They only love ya when ya on
They only love ya when ya on
The only other time is when you're gone
They only love ya when ya on
What goes up come do-ow-own

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Welcome to 2011 where everybody's the realest
Everyone who a midget, say they do it the biggest
Every part of ya business is everybody business
Got my name all in your mouth
I should have been a dentist
Yeah, everybody done did it
Everybody's a critic
I'm like "Whatchu talkin' bout" like everybody's a Willis
Man, they say they love you when the block on smash
Since they so in love, tell 'em they can kiss my cash
Wait a minute you don't like me, Well I don't like you
These fakers sayin' that they real but I see right through
The old me, that was the realest person I knew
The new me probably the realest person times two

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
So when you feels like it's everybody for themselves
And the place where ya living is'nt far from hell
And they keep tellin' you "you were born to fail"
And everybody say they real but it's too hard to tell
So until I die, I'mma always grind
I'mma be ok, I'mma be alright
If they say I fail, that would be a lie
But there ain't no such thing as a tie
They only love ya when ya on

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Hold up
You got to be out ya conscience
They ain't got no sense, that's why they call it nonsense
How they gon talk about what you never accomplish?
Like they dun done something thats worthy of my responses
Look at the tags, I'm showing 'em how to stunt G
Candy and papers plates, it looks like I got the munchies
It's so ironic they couch got money in 'em
But y'all always on the couch and never get any money
Where's Cupid, they only love ya till ya next hook
But I don't check the gossip blogs
I check check books
Ask Lebron they say winning is the best look
Every move I make is right like I ain't got a left foot
To keep it real a record deal couldn't stop me
I'm bootlegging bullets, you can still get a copy
Lucifer is in a pair of heels in the lobby
I don't dance with the devil call it trilluminati

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
So when you feels like it's everybody for themselves
And the place where ya living is'nt far from hell
And they keep tellin' you "you were born to fail"
And everybody say they real but it's too hard to tell
So until I die, I'mma always grind
I'mma be ok, I'mma be alright
If they say I fail, that would be a lie
But there ain't no such thing as a tie
They only love ya when ya on

[Bridge: Chamillionaire]
Northside where ya at
Northside let me know you got my back

They only love ya when ya on

Southside where ya at
Southside, let me know you got my back
Yeah
Eastside where ya at
Eastside my nigga you got my back

They only love ya when ya on
Westside where ya at
Westside let me know you got my back

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, I'm a get money nigga, on a daily basis
Road to the riches, potholes in the pavements
Thats why I follow every rule and regulation
Making rap money off this game I've been laced with
Uh, and you can blame it on black sam
Blame it on Crenshaw and Slauson Ave
Fly wit' bad bitch with a fat ass
Bail money, big pistol and black mag
That's how we play it, we living with the fast cash
To all my haters, consider this the last laugh
I've been the greatest in my city, now I'm past that
It's all money ASCAP, broke bitches bag back
Please, Louie notes, Louis back packs
First class seats like a pillow top mattress
Uh, we can't take it to the casket so I'mma spend these rags
Just to laugh at your reaction

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
So when you feels like it's everybody for themselves
And the place where ya living is'nt far from hell
And they keep tellin' you "you were born to fail"
And everybody say they real but it's too hard to tell
So until I die, I'mma always grind
I'mma be ok, I'mma be alright
If they say I fail, that would be a lie
But there ain't no such thing as a tie
They only love ya when ya on

[Outro: Chamillionaire]
I know, I know-ow-ow-ow
They only love ya when ya one
I know, I know-ow-ow-ow
They only love ya when ya one
What goes up, must come down
What goes up, comes down
What goes up, must come down
What goes up, comes do-ow-oown!
