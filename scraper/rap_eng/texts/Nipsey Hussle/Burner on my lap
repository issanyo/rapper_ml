[Hook:]
I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, and my beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your town
I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, and my beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your town

[Verse 1:]
My Mama wanna know why I'm banging
She told me ima lose my life
I ain't trippin I'm a crip and ima do it right
'Fore I run from a nigga I lose the fight
I gotta hustle, momma ima move the white
If I died came back I'd do it twice
Brain washed by the block it consumed my life
Cool nigga but a killa when the mood is right
Bullets have the dogs howling at the moon at night
Momma its cold outside
Ain't no hope outside
Couple niggas getting money most us broke outside
Rocks in the house selling dope outside
Reminiscing on my niggas that got smoked outside
Suckas in the house when them locs outside
Huslta gotta eat when them folks outside
Got a burner in my lap and I'm dippin in my bucket
Lifes a bitch nigga fuck it!

[Hook:]
I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, and my beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your town
I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, and my beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your town

[Verse 2:]
They say we probably die sanging, banging, pressing the line
All a nigga really got is my respect and my pride
Got a Chopper for the coppers keep protecting the ride
Every nigga got a limit never step on the line
When the set say it's on I'm expecting to ride
When the world say I'm on I got the set on my side
Matter fact a nigga got the set on my back
Slauson boy, the world ain't ready for that
Nigga it's cold in my hood
Ain't no hope in my hood
Couple homies couldn't cope smoking dope in my hood
But I could never ever be from no other hood
And I could never ever leave my folks in the hood
Thank the Lord every morning that I woke in the hood
And summers that I wrote prome spokes in the hood
If I never sold a mil off what I wrote in my hood
I ain't trippin cause niggas know I spoke for my hood

[Hook:]
I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your tow I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your town

Bigger Than Life: (Starts at 4:20)

[Verse 1:]
I dont want your love
It’s not why I make music
I owe myself, I told myself back then that I would do this
And I always look so out of reach
It just seems so confusing
That I felt my place in life
A young black man its seems so useless
That I don’t want no help
Just let me suffer through this
The world would not know Jesus Christ if there was never Judas
This knife thats in my back
It’d be the the truth that introduced us
And the distance inbetween us
Its the proof of my conclusion
So life is what you make it
I hope you make a movement
Hope your opportunity survives the opportunist
Hoping as you walk across the sand you see my shoeprint
And you follow, til it change your life, it’s all an evolution
And I hope you find your passion, cause I found mine in this music
But I hope it’s not material cause that’s all an illusion
And they all in colusion
This racist institution double standard
Acting like they not the reason we ruthless

[June Summers - Hook]
Tonight is my night
This is my moment
Feeling bigger than life
But I gotta own it
Its a victory
Lets make history

[Verse 2:]
Look at where I started and look at where I’m standing
Y’all can say its luck
But I know that its planning
Shout out to the pain
That gave me understanding
Shout out to my gang
It turned me to a savage
So niggas could say what they want to
But I go through what they haven’t
But it’s not ego driven, it’s not me boasting and bragging
This road I chose to go down
Hard to slow down when in traffic
In order for me to grow I had to let go of some habits
And its easy to say I’m on now cause you see it, and it happens
But before it ever did I had to believe and get it cracking
So I’m gon take you back then, 32 shots and my mack 10
With a dream minus the means my early teens was fucking tragic
And deep
Inside my mind is buried crimes you can’t imagine
That I wrestle with the night demons that I fight I can’t get past it
So no matter how straight your cash get
It don’t matter if you plastic
I was looking for the lights and all we stumbled across was flashes
But tonight…

[June Summers - Bridge]
Bigger than average life
I’m brighter than Vegas lights
Feeling like I can’t lose
Any other day I do
Its feels like I’m 8 feet tall
Tonight is my night
For sure, for sure

[Verse 3:]
So if it’s meant, than it’s gon be
People love it, cause they know it’s the real me
The cops hate it, so they hope my homies kill me
But I don’t want the fame, I just want y’all to feel me
It’s my time, so I’m going in
We ball till we fall, fuck how the story ends
We see these niggas hatin’
I know you hoes plotting
I ain't worried bout it
Cause I know God got me
Say I know God got me
Yeah I know God got me
Yeah I know God got me
See I ain't worried bout it
Cause I know God got me
Once in a lifetime shit you know
Song dedicated to everybody out there with a muthafucking dream
FUCK what they say, do your shit
