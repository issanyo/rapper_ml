[Hook: Nipsey Hussle]
It's so hard out here
But I'm still breathing
I said it's hard out here
But my nigga I ain't leaving

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Lookie
I show niggas too much love
And not enough discipline
Now look at all this backwards shit a nigga in
Homies want my head
They'd rather see me dead
Than paper'd up on BET that nigga getting bread
What you thought, what you think, what that shit do?
I heard Nipsey getting paper, is that shit true?
Yeah, he used to hussle off slauson
Type a nigga probably (feast up)(?) on a coffin
Cos homies families was hurting
But what's it worth when these niggas want your carcus
Yeah I know they probably smile up in your face
But I know you niggas phony cos there's sweat up in your shake
Nigga jealousy, how easily niggas forget
Used to walk thrugh the hood, nigga didn't have shit
I just hussled off the corner, and I stacked a couple chips
Then I hit the parking lot, with that brand new whip
How you love that, ain't you supposed to smile for me?
Why you hate that? oh you playing high for me
They say cut the grass and the snakes will show
Is you niggas mad at me or do you hate my doh
Just let me know

[Hook: Nipsey Hussle]
It's so hard out here
But I'm still breathing
I said it's hard out here
But my nigga I ain't leaving

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Lookie
When I was 15 my momma kicked me out and changed the locks
Her husband used to beat on us and talk shit alot
You ain't my daddy, nigga I ain't gotta listen to you
Then my momma switched sides like nigga, yeah you do
I used to wanna stay away, used to hate to come home
Outcasted from the family cos we wasn't his own
Now that's scandalous, how'd you let him hit me that hard?
Now that's scandalous, how'd you let your two kids starve?
No lunch money, was bummy and treated like a step child
Let me loose on these streets, the nigga went wild
No direction, false concept of family
Quick to bust the first damn burner that they handed me
Momma these white folks'll never understand a gee
Crying to the judge and they still reprimanded me
Used to wonder why you act like you always was mad at me
When cuz was the issue but momma I forgive you

[Hook: Nipsey Hussle]
It's so hard out here
But I'm still breathing
I said it's hard out here
But my nigga I ain't leaving
