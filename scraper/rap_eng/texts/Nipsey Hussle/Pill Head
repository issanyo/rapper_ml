[Chorus:]
She ain’t a stripper she just hit the club and get drunk
The hoochie special way bro I’m talkin real dunk
She ain’t a stripper she just hit the club an get drunk[x2]
Dat bitch a pill head
Pill head
Dat bitch a pill head

[Yung - Verse 1:]
Look, ha!
That bitch a pill head, she get ill head, I mean she kill head, she act Brain dead
She lost her body nigga, poppin' mollies nigga
I’m on deck so these bitches always find me nigga
These niggas handcuffed ma niggas all fucked
The bitch is too much, so I never trust
The bitch is still drunk, she still turnt up
Called the medic for her friend she ain’t learn nuttin
Ma niggas hit the club and she still there
Poppin' pill man she rollin' like the wheelchair
It got her fucked up, she lookin' fucked up
An she knows so cover it wit' makeup
That shit is still wid it, I mean it’s caked up
She was gettin' money, she was caked up
But I’m da bill man, never give a fuck
Tell all 'em bitches that’s poppin' I tell 'em good luck (ha!)

[Chorus]

[JayAre - Verse 2:]
She like daddy where da pills at, ova here where it’s real at
I think her booty gettin' small but it’s still fat
She suck dick fo’ a molly, yea a real rat
She on IG, she got her titties out
All da homies tryna see what she’s really 'bout
She 'bout that life, you know that life
Suck, fuck real quick on da first night
Cause she turnt up, yea dat pill like magic
Shit kick in she get rachet
Wit her friends, hella bandz, pop two mollies every weekend
She take a pole class she really do tricks
Follow all of dese bitches wid a blueprint
Bitch get used like a pool stick
She got a older brother an he keep a full clip
She a trip

[Chorus]

[Smoove Da General - Verse 3:]
Dat bitch a pill head
Wit dem little legs, reach in her pocket she got a little bread
But she got pills tho, she off dem heels tho
An she got one nigga she go really kill fo’
An she don’t like bitches but she got home girls
They all pop pills, they be in they own world
An they be loud as fuck, wife beaters an checks
They be out in da street poppin dat ass in the truck
They keep grindin' now they lookin fo’ OJ
She pin a lil nigga looks summin like OJ
I’m rollin up the grass feelin nuttin like Jose
She off dat pill still drinkin dat Hozay
Cause she used to it she ain’t new to it (no)
Shit ain’t easy nigga (never) you do it (do it)
She pop one she go pop two (pop two)
She fucked him now she fucked you (fucked you, ha!)
Bitch!

[Chorus][x2]
