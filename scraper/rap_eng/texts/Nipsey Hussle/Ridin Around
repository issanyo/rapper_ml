[Intro: RJ]
Never gonna love no broke ass bitch, woah
Mustard on the beat, ho!

[Hook: Nipsey Hussle & RJ]
Ridin 'round, out of bounds
40 cal, 30 rounds
You make it from nothing, such a wonderful feeling
My clothes expensive, my hoes appealing
Started to lose friends when they notice you winning
They see that we winning
Started to lose friends when they notice you winning
They see that we winning

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, came to get money, pat on my back cause I did it
I pull up in foreign blowing smoke through the ceiling
You make it from nothing, such a wonderful feeling
My clothes expensive, my hoes appealing
My cars go fast, my pockets is fat
I take your bitch and we go shopping at Sachs
I'm a popular mack, never stop for them rats
Flipped a lot of them racks while I fuck with this rap
Nigga hustling back so they stuck in the set
Playing Russian Roulette, me I'm puffing the best
I'm a fucking exec, money, power, respect
All my weapons is fresh, on the West I'm a rep
I'm the fucking connect, I could cut you a check
I could put you in the game and let you hustle the rest
I got a lust for success, you know it come with the stress
So we party every night, what the fuck you expect?

[Verse 2: RJ]
Never gon' love no broke ass bitch
Never one broke bitch gon change me
Mr. Right Back, back and she pays me
Whip the ghost like I'm bringing back slavery
Mr. L.A. I just caught a lick
Dug it out the mud like a forklift
I'm with some balling ass Bloods, some cold Crips
Don't get dragged out the club like a coat, bitch
I turn L.A. into Antarctica
The nigga switched on me it's like an audible
Dodging a fiend it ain't affordable
My pull up game came with a urinal
Extendo for certain
Forties with the thirties like it's Harlems on Vernon
Man 'cause niggas up in L.A. barbies
Rappers want me get some help and sell their merch

[Outro]
So I give this girl a compliment the other day, you know, one of the those "you're beautiful". And she gon say "Thank you" and walk away. I say, "Bitch, hold on a second, lemme talk to you. I don't know who be complimenting you, but a thank you ain't enough for me? Cause I don't be just giving out compliments on the street to strangers like that. So I'ma need you, err-re-err, rewind that and add, uh, "I appreciate that" proceeding by a compliment directed towards me. Bitch, cause I look good too, motherfucker I deserve a compliment all too. Fuck you talking 'bout with a just "Thank you"? How you just gonna give me a thank you?
