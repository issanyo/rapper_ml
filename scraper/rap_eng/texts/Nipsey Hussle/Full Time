[Hook: Nipsey Hussle]
Full time on the road
Make time for your folks
Choke time do the most
This year when I cross
Did that for the bros
One time for the coast
Light one nigga, smoke
Shoot guns, never choke
Full time on the road
Make time for your folks
Choke time do the most
This year when I cross
Did that for the bros
One time for the coast
Light one nigga, smoke
Shoot guns, never choke

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Moved up on the rope
Tell me who came up like the loc?
Blacc Sam on parole
Turned that to the store
Turned that to a brand
Did that for the fam
Cruised up to the club
New Chucks on the girl
We built to last, don't break a beam
Nobody put us here but still we made it here
Me and my lady friend in my Mercedes Benz
We live a type of life you couldn't make pretend
Need a safe and then
I'm in the bank again
You know I play to win
I want some paper thin
Into a spacious crib
Ain't gotta make my bed
I'm eating steak and eggs
And orchestrating biz'

[Hook: Nipsey Hussle]
Full time on the road
Make time for your folks
Choke time do the most
This year when I cross
Did that for the bros
One time for the coast
Light one nigga, smoke
Shoot guns, never choke

[Verse 2: Mitchy Slick]
Got laced by niggas that rock four finger rings
And had leather on the back of they Guess jeans the 80's
Made a nigga crazy and hazily
I was no longer a baby
Soon as I got in that Mercedes they had to pay me
Makin' hoes tap out like a Gracie
Young gang banger turned jumbo
Ridin' in somethin' that ain't humble
Blowin' on somethin' that's from Humbo
Like bump a nigga that's cookin' up gumbo
Whoop wanna park so I been on
Decorated from missions I went on
Mention this nigga long I been on
You done hit our survival syndrome
Hear my story you thought a nigga on been gone
On the news countless times the shit wrong
But real niggas always end up in the end-zone
Did the most, ended up in the Enzo
Property on the coast where my mens blow
And plot on ways for us to get more

[Bridge: Mitchy Slick]
And plot on ways for us to get more
And plot on ways for us to get more
And plot on ways for us to get more
And plot on ways for us to get more
I said plot on ways for us to get more

[Hook: Nipsey Hussle]
Full time on the road
Make time for your folks
Choke time do the most
This year when I cross
Did that for the bros
One time for the coast
Light one nigga, smoke
Shoot guns, never choke
