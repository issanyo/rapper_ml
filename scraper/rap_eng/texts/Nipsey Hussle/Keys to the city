Chorus:
455, I drive by doing 100
And I stay...
Cause I do what I need
And that's the reason that they love me
Cause I've been making money
The keys to my city!
It feels good to be on top, I got the keys to the city!
This is how it feels to be a big shot!

Hustle hustle Listen!
Look Black on Black Mercedes tattoos on my lady friends
...
I turn these hoes to lesbians
Make a fuck or best of friends
Get here for one hour, smell the blood and catch my second...
I've been on my tour bus
She probably just had sex with him
She's out of your possession
You cannot protect her...
South Central that's my residence
Barely like those...
And if I'm not the king of this
I must be the president
O M G I'm in a shit!
Money is my medicine
Shout out to my niggas in the pen Text Messaging
Shout out to them bitches gettin it in, in they crevices
... Make sex scenes so irrelevant
Forget about the risk we took, I never can
Rebel in this white man's world until they bury him
Being broke is so un-American
That's why I'm screaming all money Till the End!


Chorus:
...
And I stay...
Cause I do what I need
And that's the reason that they love me
Cause I've been making money
The keys to my city!
It feels good to be on top, I got the keys to the city!
This is how it feels to be a big shot!

Pull up the old school, me and lil Shady Blue
Fresh up out the County jail, they held us up without no bail
Ten stacks to my lawyer, said a plan so we prevail
Jealous niggas hated that love to see a nigga fail
Miss me with that "Bro I love you"
Suck a nigga beef for real
Fake as 4 dollar bills
Hit the gas, we out of here!
Oh no, wait! A fox heels, spinning like we got a meal
Smoked so mush Kush got us feeling we off a Pill
They know we got dollar still
And bitches know we got the bill
Eating ..  Been here daily, drive my baby momma crazy
Name a nigga that could faze me
Pussy dad does not persuade me
I swear I'll make them hate me
Plus we never shop at Macy's
Louis V, Gucci, maybe
... Blue Mercedes
We were both familiar faces
Spinning faster, dogging cases
... Bring the cases, that's what we told the waitress
... For all you try to play us

Chorus:
...
And I stay...
Cause I do what I need
And that's the reason that they love me
Cause I've been making money
The keys to my city!
It feels good to be on top, I got the keys to the city!
This is how it feels to be a big shot!

Plus, plus, straight pants,...
You thought that I'll be dead doing life, cause what I rap is true

Just another you know who
Sam had some time to do
And yea, Steve is cool, but I heard Mick used an animal
Fuck with what they were talking about
We just did what we had to do
It became the most valuable, after I dropped that on you tube
From the West Coast at least, and for the West Coast I speak
Cause I'm filled with guilt,...
Where I'm supposed to be
I'll be yours... Been this shit
You all forgot to...
And like the... My pistol will smoke for free
If money ain't got no on streets
Got to keep her close to me
Put that on the man that's on the cross...
It wasn't always banking but I speak about it openly
No shame in my game
I did my thing, go in... Streets
Who's the hottest on the West
All you niggers know it's me
So tell whoever had the luck that Nipsey Hussle stole the key

Chorus:
...
And I stay...
Cause I do what I need
And that's the reason that they love me
Cause I've been making money
The keys to my city!
It feels good to be on top, I got the keys to the city!
This is how it feels to be a big shot
