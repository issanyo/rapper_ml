[Intro]
Yeah, why would I stop?
When you get money like this, you gotta ask yourself that question
They say the greatest threat to your future success
Is your current success, that’s why I go hard

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Ah, look, 7 series black Benz, gun metal mac 10
Yellow bone trophy, she gonna blow me as I back in
Marijuana smoking black Versace shade glass tint
Cover up my blood shot eyes like an aspirin
Nigga, balling that’s your past tense
I’m the present and the future of this rap shit
Don’t act like you can’t hear it, you should fear it
Kill me can’t mute my spirit
When the feature cut the check nigga you can’t clear it
Undisputed on the west, if not who can’t hear it
Get anywhere respect, a young dude won’t hear it
It’s 20k in some states just for ?
Look, you start getting rap money, they say you act funny
But I remember how I thought when I was that hungry
You let them take your sack from you, you’ll be back bummy
So niggas be ready to kill, for in them dudes take all racks from them
Same mind, stay different grind rate
The desperation tear fall, cause the price changed
Make a hundred thousand dollars off a liquor, you cam make 10 million of a hit
Nigga not to mention, all the glamour and the glimpse
Sold your soul for the fame hey, ain’t that a bitch?
Ah, and when I pull up they say ain’t that the 6?
You talk money but I ain’t that convinced

[Hook]
I’m getting paid, sometimes I wanna get away
Cause these days niggas fake
I’m on my grind, I think therefore I ain’t doing time
That’s why I’m solo when I ride
I’m getting paid, sometimes I wanna get away
Cause these days niggas fake
Wake up on my money with no emotions on my face
Keep a choppa at the house and a 40 at my waist

[Verse 2: Ken Malik]
My strive, that’s all a nigga got
I’m the last one leader, first one to bleed the block
Now that grind mode can’t stop, won’t stop
I’m just tryina turn that 1997 to a yacht
And put my son in the spot
So he ain’t never gotta worry bout the shit that he ain’t got
Just watch how I put my niggas in position
Without a handout given, we was out here fly living
Ah, I’m innocent until the jury pleads
Guilty, your bitch ? jury bleeds
Bro what? You niggas ain't no kin to me
A bunch of niggas suffering from ?
Hopeless ass rap bitches in it for the cheese
Can't get comfortable, I’m working on that enemy
The hustle there my nigga, though you're lacking energy
Area 16 will bring you closer to Ken Malik

[Hook]
