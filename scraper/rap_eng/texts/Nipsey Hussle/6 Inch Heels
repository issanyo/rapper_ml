[Intro: Nipsey Hussle]
No Punches

[Verse 1]
Bounce back off every loss like a real nigga
Handle business like a man, I’ll make a deal with you
Loyalty for loyalty, I keep it real with you
You go to war, then I’m gonna kill with you
Married to the streets, ask me why I’m still with her
Ask a don this obvious, I’m a field nigga
Around the corner it’s a dozen niggas still tripping
They’ll still kill you if you still slipping
Look, I put curtains on my rear wind shield
My bitch bad but my wrist on chill
My bitch bad, man, that bitch got skills
She 5’11 rocking 6 inch heels
She my Excedrin in this sick ass world
She probably make a stray bitch toes curl
She used to being rich nigga, retail
But money’s my only fetish with my rich ass self
Hussle, I know y’all hating but I wish y’all well
I’m eating steak, cracking crip leg shells
I’m getting cake, let the champagne spill
It’s either participate, or your bitch ass fail, nigga

[Hook: June Summers]
I’m looking at the world through rose colored glasses
I could chase this dream but no I had to catch it
I been 10 toes down, I’m out chea, looking back that’s how I got here
‘Cause even when I slept in the gutter, I stared at the sky

[Verse 2]
Young niggas fucking bitches, getting dope money
745, gold chain, rope money
Was every man for himself when you was broke bumy
You make it happen, niggas acting like you owe something
My nigga, I just wanna let you know something
The clock ticking, you gotta get it and devote something
The transition and legitimize the flow of it
It’s just a given that these folks coming
Look, I knew some niggas that was killers and these hoes loved them
Was getting money till some other killers told on them
The whole city, and they business they was known for
A string of bank robberies, was beasting for a whole summer
It ain’t no hall of fame, it’s over and they don’t love you
Ain’t no arenas hanging jerseys with your old numbers
You gotta get what you can get and make the most of it
You beat the odds then you grow from it, look

[Hook]


[Verse 3]
Let’s get it straight, these niggas fake
It's Nothing though, we getting cake
My mornings early, my nights is late
It's all dollar signs in on my license plate
Y’all niggas struggling, my life is great
You freestyling your life, I write my fate
I play to win ‘cause life’s a game
Put your all in this music and your life will change
It’s what I told myself, that’s what I showed myself
It’s a cold and lonely road, you gotta go for self
I meditated ‘cause I knew I had to know myself
Said 600 Benz, is what I owe myself
Worldwide recognition, now my flow is known
In and out the States, pay me just to show my face
Bottle after bottle, empty out the case
Hip hop, empty out the safe

[Hook]
