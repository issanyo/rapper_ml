[Hook x2]
That California Water
Got that nigga wavin' on your daughter
She wanna fuck, but I don't even bother
I just might stall her, bring her to the mall tomorrow
I got California Water

[Verse 1: Big Lean]
It's Lean, baby
AMG Mercedes going 80 in a 50 zone, dawg
Shit done changed, dawg
Please tell your bitch leave me 'lone, dawg
I don't got no time for her & I ain't got no time for that
Bitch, where my dollas at?
Tell your man he can holla back, if he want you back
He can cut the check, you know I'm down with that
Talkin' no hard feeling, you know what the deal is
Money makin' be the only thing, Flame Boys be the only gang
You know we gon' turn up 'til we burn up, that bullshit don't concern us
This one's for the learners who wanna be like us
Wonder what we drink when we turning up
It's that California Water when we be in Toronto
It's just like that, where my players at?

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Born and raised in Southern California
So you know where hoes and they get spoiled
Only thing I seen from close was Florida
Flew from Europe, got stopped at the border
Heard Toronto got some flavours for you
Said I got too many cases for 'em
Pistol charges, on probation for it
I paid my lawyer, I'm still paying for it
I missed at least two hundred thousand dollars
Flew to Manhattan then I fucked my stylist
Mac 11 underneath the mattress
Make deposits, I don't check my balance
Perrier in my palace
