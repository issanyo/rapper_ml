[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Writing songs, for my dawgs, for my squad, from my heart
How we won, how we lost
How we came, how we saw
Through it all, ash backs out the roof, foreign cars
In pursuit by the law
Still we rich, for the stores
Oh my god, oh my god so high up, I'm so far
Deja vu, I been here before then come back down to Earth
Need to resist the urge
Still no breaks on this course
Live and die, either or
Go for broke, hustle hard
Leave it all, on the floor, on the floor

[Verse 2: Cuzzy Capone]
West side of Slauson, grind and make a million
We them hungry niggas in between them buildings
Risking everything we got to feed our children
My city built up from love but we killed it
Hard times posted with pebbles and booted with it
I was told the money was there it's up to you to get it
Girbaud with the Eddie Bauer no True religion
Ralph Lauren ski jacket with the ruger in it
Quarter back in the block with the [?] game
I wasn't always successful but still I made plays
Under pressure I run with the rock but still I get away
The main focus was living to see another day
Hall of famer in the league but I never play
I left my granny house young but I should have stayed
Motivated by money I was getting paid
Go-getter from the start nah I never changed
I never changed

[Verse 3: J Stone]
I'm against all odds
Niggas getting bodied going against my squad for real
Down to squad when I hear y'all pop for real
Word to the streets I'm a nigga they tried to kill
Cos I was with the extras war has to have essence
Bang straps with no question
Got cracked with the Wesson, went back I was stressing
Got out and ran laps and got my blessings you still guessing
Bitches acting like they know me now wanna blow me down
But if I blow down they won't hold me down so fuck 'em
I don't want the honey I just want the money
No ride and hopping like a bunny when them things is sunny
I put my bro's before these hoes she can't take it from me
Laughing to the bank but it ain't shit funny
Rich run over royalties we getting money
