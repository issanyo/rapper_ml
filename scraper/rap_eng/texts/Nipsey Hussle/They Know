[Verse 1]
Can't stop this money marathon but they gonna try regardless
When you go as hard as Hussle they gonna pay you homage
Add my jewellery up 100,000 dollars
Plus I got the pink slips to the foreign shit that I be drivin'
Built my road to riches over lack of options
Out the trunk of my blue cutlass with my back to Slauson
Now my car's fresh off the lot and hoes got low mileage
Flying out getting paid 10 thousand a show, I'm in
2A with my seat back with my window up
Thinking bout the funny niggas that done switched it up
We made some plans most of them stuck
So tell me one good reason I should give a fuck

[Hook]
They know, still cleaning up on the road
Living fast sip slow
Spending cash to get mo
They know, keep a gun everywhere I go
Riding round getting dough
Living fast and sip slow
They know, still cleaning up on the road
Living fast and sip slow
Keep a gun everywhere I go
They know, still ride around getting dough
Livin fast and sip slow
Gun everywhere I go, they know

[Verse 2]
Tattoos on my face tattoos on my neck
Pistols in my stash one button make those eject
Niggas hate, no effect
Can’t get close enough to touch so
Hoes throw me sex
Posted, Don't sleep cuz I won't slip
Won’t lose cause I won’t quit
Life is hard, yeah no shit
But I’m a real nigga so I don't bitch
That go for my whole clique, self made I don’t owe shit
Only ride to my own shit
I’m so fly I’m oh shit I mean so fly I don’t know shit
My offence I got no kicks I don’t touch guns I got no prints
And I’m so fly and I got no tints
Riding round without no rims
Why? cause I did that and like '06 but they know this

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah that’s right, that’s right
Nigga don’t grind, nigga don’t eat
That’s life, that’s life
Yeah
See I was on the road but I’m back right
TMC this that right new shows booked and new tracks right
Yeah every nigga out here act like
But just a few of us live that life you know first class
And got racks right yeah
We just sticking to the facts right
Rich before rap got crack right
Lost everything and got back right
Yeah so let’s sip slow to this fast life
We gonna do the same thing today and we passed out from last night
But it’s cool cuz my stacks right if I’m in the club then it's packed tight
People lie but my stats right and in my last life I was a flash light
Nah, I’m just sayin' though I'm that bright
It don't even make sense like a black light
How I came put the city on my back no niggas cosign
Guess I’m just that type
But it’s a marathon, run a lap life
My young nigga homie got that flight
And niggas ain’t tryin’ to fight Fatz, right?
And Blacc Sam got the mac, right?
