[Intro: Jesse Rutherford]
Dream, where everybody loves me
Living in a dream world, how'd I get so lucky?
So tell me how you feel (Tell me, tell me, tell me)
Ooh, baby, is anything real? (Tell me, tell me, tell me)
Ooh, darling, ha—I got nothing to lose (Tell me, tell me, tell me)
Nothing to lose (Nothing to lose)
I got nothing to prove
Nothing to you (Ooh)

[Verse 1: Jesse Rutherford]
Movin' at a mile a minute
Set the pace, I'm goin' over the limit
Always wondered what I've been missin'
The checkered flag doesn't mean that you're finished, oh
I got everything that I wanted
I built myself a house on the hill
All my passion fulfilled, saw it fast like a film
All that sadness and guilt, now I just wanna chill
But I can't, my suntan's from Thailand
Swimming on a cloud made of hands
Money in my pockets, Louis wallet in my pants
No AC in the crib but I got plenty of fans
Said "I love you" too soon
Reached for the stars and I hit the moon
Now every time I look at you
Feels like déjà vu, oh

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
Living in a dream
Where everybody loves me (Everybody loves me)
Living in a dream world
How'd I get so lucky? (How'd I get so)
So tell me how you feel

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle & Jesse Rutherford]
Uh, I feel like a legend in these Puma suedes
I'ma still make millions when this music fade
Reinvent every time the music change
My gut had me feeling like I knew the way
I feel like I spoke for my generation
All game and my demonstration
To my gang, I'm a different greatness
Pay dues, never missed a payment
Stay true, now it's entertainment
Feel like I'm built for whatever storm
Whatever way the game test me, in whatever form
War in dark times that they never saw
I feel like I stand tall and can never fall (Yeah)
I feel like a one on one (Alright)
Like the last dope boy in the game with a hunnid tons (Yeah)
2Pac got the troublesome
A Boosie Badazz, drop a bag on you niggas if I want it done

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
Living in a dream
Where everybody loves me (Everybody loves me)
Living in a dream world
How'd I get so lucky? (How'd I get so)
So tell me how you feel

[Outro: Jesse Rutherford]
Now the war is over
Can't get any older
