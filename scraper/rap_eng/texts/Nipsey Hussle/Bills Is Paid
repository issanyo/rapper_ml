[DJ Skee Intro]

[Hook]
My bills are paid
And everything's okay
It's like every day here
Summertime in L.A

[Verse 1: Game]
I'm from Compton, home of the fiends
Home of the monsters, home of triple beams
Home of the shattered fucking dreams
Where most niggas I grew up with ain't make it to see they teens
Ain't no Freddy, ain't no Jason, but niggas too scared to dream
And they ripping pages out of them books bout Dr. King
You don't wanna know half the shit I seen
Where reading a magazine get you hit with a magazine
Niggas ain't scared to murder cause the jails too packed
Kill a nigga, he be out before the "R.I.P." tat
I seen Raider snapbacks by Starter
Then I seen Dre make that Sox hat harder
Then I seen Makavelli go at Shawn Carter
Then I seen that block where B.I.G. got slaughtered
Then I knew it was my calling
G the fuck up or die balling
Lace them red Chucks up, but die falling

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
I'm rising in this game and it feels great
Still trying to keep it real, niggas still fake
I'm so impatient, but I still wait
Dropped The Marathon in November, niggas still late
Still show love when I feel hate
On a scale of one to ten, need a high heel eight
Or better, blowing this cheddar like I'm Bill Gates
Whatever, I'm in to win til this movie ends
Smoking California, eating Peruvian
Out on Miami Beach, my niggas, a few of them
Just like Beverly Hills, the bitches we usually wear
From wishing on a star, nigga, took it far
And if I lost it all to war, I wouldn't trip at all
It sound crazy when I say it
But the fear of falling off is the only thing that could take it
I'm straight

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Game]
I got my hoodie on, it's a Starter
I'mma rock this motherfucker for Trayvon Martin
I'mma rock this motherfucker for Trayvon's daughter
That he coulda had; where's his killer at? The whole hood is mad
That ain't the first time, won't be the last
See reflections of my past while I guzzle through this glass
Make me want to run up on you with the muzzle -- "Where the cash?"
Retaliation is none, niggas can't afford the gas
Got a mansion in the Hills, Rottweilers by the gates
Red Ghost's in the driveway and ducks by the lake
Spending time with my daughter so them ducks gotta wait
Let a nigga call it a duck, he gonna eat a .38
I'm supposed to be this fucking rich
I'm supposed to be this fucking great
I'm a menace to society, no Larenz Tate
But me and my niggas straight and

[Hook]
