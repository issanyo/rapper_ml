[Hook - Dom Kennedy:]
Smoke marijuana, watch cost a Honda and the crib got remarkable views
Eating downtown, look like it's China, I be making these real nigga moves

[Verse 1 - Nipsey Hu$$le:]
Uh look, swervin... feelin this shit, brown liquor on my liver and shit
Fast life, still livin and shit, black leather suede ceilings and shit
Top floor tall building and shit, live by the model let's get killed or get rich
Fly to islands just to chill with a bitch, I'm just a nigga that was real and that's it
With no regards to how you feel about shit, them German plates on my 6
I sleep light, but I dream big, I tend to talk less cause I seen shit
Stick to the script until the scene switch, I wrote this movie, get this money is what the theme is
I'm smoking weed like a weed head, Mimosas by the oceans with the cheese eggs
Flickin ashes out my sunroof, victory cause real niggas in the lead here

A steak every week, keep it too street, you know I'm a do what I do
Wallet so plush, you know my stock's up, I be making these real nigga moves

[Verse 2 - Dom Kennedy:]
I'm working, to like 3 AM, the most beloved nigga from the CA, unh
We hit Mitchell&Ness in the PAD, it's back to LA, let the VA speak
We at sachi bowl, [?], That Perrier water, that's for me right there
No soda drinkin, french fries at the roller rink, just the playa president, what you hoes been thinkin?
Letting niggas gas you all crazy, last time I seen him he was acting all shady
CLS taillights pass you all crazy, OPM the army, exactly like baby
Except we ain't got no funding from Universal, but still getting cameos in them big commercials
Gimme something to mix with this lil purp, light that up keep it in the circle, ya know
