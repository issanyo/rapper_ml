[Hook](x2)
I don't feel none of y'all pain
Y'all ain't take none of these risks
I don't feel none of y'all made the decisions
I made to be real with this shit
I don't trust none of y'all motives
I know you lacking the code
I know I gotta be tapped into something
From how they attacking my soul

[Verse 1]
Ride with my niggas regardless
I'll die in the field where the mission was started
Fuck all your Hollywood dreams
Fuck up your Hollywood parties
Valet park, quarter mill
And my baby mama flawless
Made a way to get us all rich
And I'm coming straight up off Slauson

[Hook](x2)
I don't feel none of y'all pain
Y'all ain't take none of these risks
I don't feel none of y'all made the decisions
I made to be real with this shit
I don't trust none of y'all motives
I know you lacking the code
I know I gotta be tapped into something
From how they attacking my soul
