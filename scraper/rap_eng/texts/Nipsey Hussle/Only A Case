[Verse 1: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Look, I went got my own shit
How you 'gon knock that
Pulled up in drop coupes
Shit with the top back
Handle my business plus when they pop always pop back
I'm back in Denver
Figure niggas ain't got that
Look where my stocks at
You study my process
Niggas is crawfish
Me I'm a lochness
Whenever I drop that
They feeling like Pac back
Hu$$le in Crenshaw's like O'shea in a Sox Hat
Classic L.A. nigga
Stay out my way nigga
We ain't the same nigga
Simple and plain
From reputation in these streets to where you sit on your plane
What you did for your fame, How much you paid for your chains
Tryna kick it with the crips so he can say that he bang
You know he ain't from the gang
That nigga playin' with flames
Got a hunnid young niggas still dealing with pain
Put a hole in your brain
Just for claiming the fame
Look, We know your type
Afraid of a fade
Iâ€™m ashamed when I say it
But shit, a spade is a spade
And me, my transition got me showered in praise
From the streets to the stage, to changing the game
International Nip Hu$$le the current exchange
Once you travel the world
You ain't returning the same
Got [a persian] in my place
Put a bird in my safe
Conscious of rainy days
So it's only a case
Yuh, I know my homies relate
Get richer do life, shit is only a case
My style spody like the 40's would say
All money yeah nigga that's the holiest faith (haha)

[Hook: Conrad]
It's only a case, knock a fuckin' hole in ya face
Headed to the top in a lane with no space
Don't make me load up this K
Shit it's only a case
Put a hole in ya face
Shit it's only a K
Knock off ya face
So stay the fuck up out my lane

[Verse 2: G.I. Joe]
I used to stand on the corner with my rocks and guns
Sell yay by the gram, see the cops we run
Get cracked at the county squabble niggas for fun
Before you even make your mattress, nigga where you from?
Made bail, hit the block in my 501s
I was just young and lIving reckless with more drama to come
Got the hood tatted on me cuz the damage was done
Real certified nigga get respect where I'm from
I ain't really gotta tell you, you can tell where I'm from
Ruthless, skanless crafty niggas hate where I'm from
Only the strongest survive in the hood I'm from
Get yo chain and you life snatched away where I'm from
Point blank, straight facts so they know me as semi
Besides the bullshit I'm on the grind chasing a milli
Politicking with some youngins that be loading up semis
Smoke blunts no fenis, we terrorizing your city
Drink 'tron out the bottle going hard on my kidneys
I'm getting money out of town some niggas climb through chimneys
Do yo thang, pimping, robbing, squabbin & jacking, whatever it takes for the money, Shit go head get it cracking
Nip's on a marathon and got em runnin they laps
Some niggas took it out of line and got to runnin they yaps
Now I'm screaming O.M.G., I hope they fuckin with that
Money all on top of money got em stacking to that
Bullets all on top of bullets they don't jam they clap
They said bullets ain't got no name, I wrote his name on the back
Shit I'm G.I. Joe and ain't no holding me back, now I'm still screaming O.M.G. I hope they fuckin with that
I know they fuckin with that, I know they fuckin with that
I'm sill screaming out O.M.G. I know they fuckin with that
Yeah, nigga
