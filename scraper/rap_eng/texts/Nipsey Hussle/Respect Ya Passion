[Hook]
Make a million cash 'fore you flatline
Make a master plan watch it backfire
Burn it all down then collect the ashes
Build it back, respect ya passion

[Verse 1]

Witness to some shit that you shouldn't see
Whisper to yourself what you wouldn't be
Victim to the block where your mama moved, now your mind-state is I'mma do what I got to do
It's really quite logical, if you was me you wouldn't shoot at them if they just shot at you?
No trust funds but my daughter do, first generation that'll start with loot
My first record deal probably saved my life
So shout out to my nigga Draws and Jonny Shipes
My roll dog doing 12 now, gotta turn this shit to heaven cause we hell bound

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Hard for y'all to fathom that we came from that
Sittin in the spot we was shaving crack
Navy blue chucks, my Mercedes black
Gave it all I got then it gave it back
30 niggas grinding on the same street
Thousand niggas dead from the same beef
Money to be made but it get risky
Inside job if it look fishy
Niggas playin' foul tryna play it down
Say that they gon' kill him if he stay around
Say that they gon' book him they just need a witness
Me I'm tryna make a exit all this politicking
Got my mind drifting, time ticking, death is in the air I'm tryna bound over my visit
Shit rough still ride wit it, rob different that's how I did it
You should

[Hook]
