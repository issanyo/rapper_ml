[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Picture me rollin', tippin' my chaueffer
Niggas look jealous, you gotta control it
Reachin' my quota, mixin' my soda
Feeling connected to God, tryna' get closer
Steppin' on roaches, me and my locsters
Just tryina get over, tryina not to get swallowed by locals
Tryn' to stay focus, kinda like moses
Like somebody chose us, sweat on my shoulder
I feel these emotions, but still i keep going
A pen to a poet
I been through the motions
I’m feeling heroic but life is a dice game
And they gave you to blow it
You might get a stripe man, but that ain't gon' pay for strollers
Its never enough to console her
Telling, your daddy’s a soldier
She needs you right now in this moment
Not dead on your back pushing roses
To me i'm just carving this sculpture
You find through with my  approaches
Doubling back as a owner
The moment of truth is upon us
Call the promoters

[Chorus: Overdoz]
Picture me rollin' rollin' rollin'
We in my friends not worried
Then we get stop by the police
Gotta make it home to my baby
Cause they say snitch gon' crazy
Gotta make it home to my baby
Cause this is they say me
Gotta make it home to my baby, Holla up, yeah
Look i bet i'mma make it home to my baby
I bet i'mma make it home to my baby
I say, i bet i'mma make it home to your baby
