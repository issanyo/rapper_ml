[Verse 1:]
Listen look look now ask yourself a question is you real or is you fake
Do you sell a nigga dreams or do you stand on what you say
When they ask you where you from you bite your lip and hesitate
Or do you step back and chuck yo hood up in they face
Is you bangin is you poppin is you turnt up
And dope money keep the kush wrapped and burnt up
Ya hot boy bullets bustin out ya grannys shit
You gangbangin even though it got your family sick
Now what your life about does money motivate your actions
Is you stackin or you lost the self satisfaction
Now ask is that your nigga or a snake in disguise
If that nigga give advice that'll lead to your demise
Just some questions

It's just some thoughts for the mind it's just some questions

[Verse 2:]
Now ask urself another question is you happy with your life
House behind a pickett fence couple kids and a wife
Or do you see urslef standin in a different light
Your ambitions of a hustla got u pumpin all night
Do you know where your goin or what you come from
I was a slanger then a banger never a dumb dumb
So what is you when u shoot without a set aim
A body part takin orders from the set brain listen what the set sayin
I will kill without a cause death before dishonour for your niggas go hard
Now ask is that your nigga or a snake in disguise
If that nigga give advice that'll lead to your demise
Just some questions

It's just some thoughts for the mind it's just some questions
