Hussle, hey
Look I pull up in the stunt with the marijuana reeking
2 bad bitches, Roosevelt for the weekend
Walk past the pool when I got by the deep end
She asked to hit the blunt when I passed to push me in
Laughs, drinks and giggles
I got pink slip pussy couple freaks and retals
I got strip club hoes with the least potential
But they mind on a million once they leave then venue
I’m talking money motivation, let me press my issue
Not a lot of people make it so it’s best you get you a
Full time grand, H-U double dollar sign
I’m taking applications if you ain't procrastinating
I’ma laugh now and laugh later
I’m a real back breaker, I’m a no slack taker
I’m a c-note counter, Cliquo downer
If she actin’ brand new, I bring the freak ho out her
Oh, oh, and she so ’bout it
Get the best drunk she got deep throat talent
Mouth piece magic, will be like god damn it
Hit it once hard to shake like a cocaine habit
Please, you know, hustle keep it p-i
Lil mama flip game on you but I see why
When I think of you my nigga I don’t think pride
I don’t think swag nigga, I don’t think fly
I don’t think style nigga, I just think why
This ol' lame ass nigga in my freestyle listen
Marathon life the tradition
Every 2000 followers, I’ll make another victim
