[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Loaded bases, that's my motivation
Niggas feelin' lucky, we should go to Vegas
2018 mode of transportation
Got me feelin' over-anxious like a home invasion
My dough inflated and I'm more creative
Signed a couple big deals, but it's no paradin'
See it's a couple niggas every generation
That wasn't supposed to make it out but decode the Matrix
And when they get to speak, it's like a coded language
Reminds niggas of they strength and all the stolen greatness
We used to shoot at niggas' at the Mobil station
Full circle, mogul motivation
My self-educated, shrewd, negotiations
Got these sharks that I'm sittin' at this table with afraid debating
No tint on my Mercedes, that's for inspiration
Two kilos on my neck, like the fuckin' 80's
Westside Slauson Ave, know my demonstration
Born and raised, ya'll affiliated, it's really greatness
Ride around like I really made it
Loaded bases, I'm gonna Wille Mays it, yeah

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Listen to my ambition 'cause I'm on one
Swingin' for the fences for the home run
Even further beyond in to the universe
But I got to make it to first, first
It feels like every second is being stolen
I risked it for every ticket we sold them
You got the ball, I'ma take it home
Bottom line, I'm gon' make it home

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, I was sittin' on my Lincoln, I start thinkin'
Nigga, I ain't gon' make a hundred mil' off in these streets and
More than likely I'm gon' end up in somebody's precinct
Even worse, horse and carriage, front the church, laid off in a hearse
I dealt with it
I ain't just out here for my health with it
I weighted risk and the reward and seen the scale tippin'
Let's all get on one accord and take the world niggas
Take the money, take the power and the girls with us
Can't buy that bullshit that they sell niggas
Bring drugs heads and jail niggas
Look all these ways they derail niggas
That's why respect me to the utmost when you seen just how I feel niggas
'Cause I ain't fail niggas, I seen it comin', didn't I tell niggas?
Different lane, same passion for the mail niggas
Switch lanes, all black, two glass ceilings, V-12 too fast nigga, gone

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Listen to my ambition 'cause I'm on one
Swingin' for the fences for the home run
Even further beyond in to the universe
But I got to make it to first, first
It feels like every second is being stolen
I risked it for every ticket we sold them
You got the ball, I'ma take it home
Bottom, I'm gon' make it home
