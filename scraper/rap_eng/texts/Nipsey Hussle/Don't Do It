Intro

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
These hoes are trifling
That's why we ain't gon' wait for 'em
These young niggas better smart up
And don't get caught up
I say shawty got a husband
But she out here creeping
These young niggas better smart up
And don't get caught up
Don't do it [x3] (noooooo)(don't do it nigga)
Just cause she's fine with ass, man she just want a nigga with cash
She trifling

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Shawty got a man but she creeping oooh
I guess she want a young nigga eating her
But I was never known to keep a ho
Met her in Mia, was with my nigga Tre a week ago
In fact, he told that he ate two weeks before
She said she ain't fuck in months, I'm like you sneaky ho
But I switch them bitches like my sneakers though
Fucking all my homies she was trynna keep a secret though
Loving the crew, love the place for the team
She sucking my dick, guess she's chasing that dream
I made her go ham, he made her a queen
I ain't chasing these hoes, nigga I'm chasing this cream

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]
She look good but to me she's just a bummy bitch
Tryna fall in love cause she know I'm bumpy rich
Hear my name ringing, she know I'm on my tip
She can't walk out her house without hearin'em play my shit
2008 came in this game and I have made a grip
Iâ€™m sucker-duckin, fuckin' with the ones I made it with
One thing they knew about the hustle, I don't save a bitch
She be content with saying she done fucked a famous crip
Basic bitch that we flippin' you be laying with
Her pussy played out, they call it Avirex
O-B-G-Y-N she got you in labor with
Your maybe baby cause you're weak and be chasin' your dick nigga
