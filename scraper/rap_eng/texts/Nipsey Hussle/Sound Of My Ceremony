[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Now if I break your heart lil' momma don't make a scene
You really mad at yourself because you couldn't do it to me
Probably call me a failure if I ain't ever achieved
I rather you call me cocky for living how I believe
That I'm a king
No sympathizing with the fake
Or suprises from the snakes
Its flock season and I value my estate
So I bought some barb wire cause they trynna climb the gate
Houston Rocket on my waist
Hip-Hop cops on my case, but fuck 'em
More deposits in the bank
God damn a nigga straight, crooked letter on my face
I'm a fly crip but I rep my whole race
Couple others eating good but everybody want a taste
They say, "get with it or them niggas gonna' take"
I say, "if you want fish let me lead you to the lake"
But niggas lazy and I'm a late night
Early morning nigga 25/8 life
Wasn't easy growing up
Had to make something out of nothing
If you struggled you relate
But now I'm straight, everything great
I don't need your help now, all of ya'll late
That's why I made sure all of ya'll shake
The way ya'll ride dick I think all of ya'll gay
Practice all night, ballin' all day
Sleeping on flights when I land I get paid
I ain't got a boss, I am not a slave
Turning up my hustle is how I give myself a raise
And it's funny how people let money make 'em change
See you stickin' to the script then you start rippin' out the pages
Of history it ain't a mystery
If I died yesterday my life would be a victory
These niggas sound stupid saying they invented me
But arguin' with fools is a waste of energy
I'm a franchise player and the owner of the team
And they only envy me cause we on a winning spree

[Hook: Nipsey Hussle]
Now, this the sound of my ceremony
The sweet smell of success, yes I wear it on me
Snoop Dogg lookin' nigga in the mirror told me
Keep getting money, fuck bitches, and be aware of homies
Cause Brutus killed Ceasar, and Judas killed Jesus
But that's where I'm a leave it
Cause they call it dry snitchin' if I take it any deeper
