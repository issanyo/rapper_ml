It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a dough I'm stepped to
When you're on your grind it's stressful
When it come to mind I'm special
I got a 7 series gamer and my window's bulletproof
So them shells is bouncing back if you should ever try and shoot
Bentley on my arm, a mercedes on my neck
Maserati on my... Hopping on a private jet
I got a car with a driver, yellow bone ride
My city on my back, but I wasn't raising...
I got a phone full of numbers that I never seem to call
Catch them bitches after show and they be throwing me they cross
Flow sick, no sanitize, murder rap records, no alibies
Live from the frontline, battle cross
Fuck talking about a dream, let's strategize

Let's talk about us, let's talk about them
Let's talk about the losses and let's talk about the wins x 2
Let's talk about everythang, let's talk about everythang
Let's talk about everythang, let's talk about everythang
Let's talk about us

Big money, that's the motivation
A lot of flights and hotels, no vacation
I told my... I was going places
Can't stamp my passports, cause there's no more spaces
I gave myself an ultimatum
Get rich or get sent to the police station
Every time they came I was so evasive
Shit I'm sorry my success don't fit your equation
Streets love me hoes too cause I flow amazing
Up the ladder to success like I know a mason
Look is mind on my money, yeah,...
I'm with a model watching kobe front row at staples
Damn a nigga fly, logo on my belt, next the shades on my eyes
Something like a legend, in the city I reside
Cause I gave it to them straight, no lies

Let's talk about us, let's talk about them
Let's talk about the losses and let's talk about the wins x 2
Let's talk about everythang, let's talk about everythang
Let's talk about everythang, let's talk about everythang
Let's talk about us

You should talk money if you call
Or I won't pick up my phone
Can't you tell I'm in my zone
For my city putting on
I'm a rider from the set
I'm the...
Choppers on the deck, still I'm flier than the rest
All I drink is champagne, respected by my gang
You know what I mean nigga, you know what I mean
... Cause I still murk me a nigga, straight up
And now I'm on my way up
Used to shoot pounds out of town, lay up
Told me she was from dakota
But I met her in miami, from a man I had to take a...
Talk to me and I'll talk back
And if you text me I'ma text back
Just say you think that you all that, yeah
I do
