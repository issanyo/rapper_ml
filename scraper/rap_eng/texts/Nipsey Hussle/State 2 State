Uh huh
Look, Listen up
I'm Finna put you on some cold game
Get you on the right track with the road train
And pimpin ain't dead that's the code name
And my whip so big I'm in both lanes(swerve)
Before she met me she ain't know shit
Now she OT makin dough quick
215 east tell her it's a road trip
She don't gimme no lip
She know imma go quick
The way you suck dick I can tell you was made for this
You do this so good, that you should get paid for this
One things fasho you gone walk down this row
Go get what you can then you run me my dough
I be thumbing through them checks, last year I was in debt
Now my lil bitch charge 1, 000 for the neck
Heard the man high need deposit for the sex
She be breaking niggas pockets for a check, Aye!

She don't need a boat, she gone jump ship
I told her head first like a front flip
She gone go to work I'm up in the field
Nigga I done hit a lick
Imma take ya girl State 2 State
If ya girl choose up, she gone stay
I been knockin hoes State 2 State

All I know is double up
Bitches come and go while this money come in lumps
Rather fall in love or rather fall in lust
Rather make 100 million dollars for the rush
Lord know I was stuck set back off the cuff
Rob niggas, sold drugs, pimp bitches, nigga so what
Every morning on a mission nigga tryna go touch
Slim told me Nip Hussle make these hoes go fuck
Then I put my foot up on her neck like a Cuban link
Money power and respect just like you would think
Takin niggas for they check baby you a beast
I don't flex I collect that's my expertise
Now
I'm a cold young nigga all my old
Premonitions way below how I'm living
Now
Round the globe I kill it
I just go get digits that's the code real nigga
Now

She don't need a boat, she gone jump ship
I told her head first like a front flip
She gone go to work I'm up in the field
Nigga I done hit a lick
Imma take ya girl State 2 State
If ya girl choose up, she gone stay
I been knockin hoes State 2 State

Or the next mutha fucka need to know
I'm just tryna catch the wave on a speed boat
Nigga tryna find business on the interstate
Fuck a renegade imma make the pussy real estate
Picture my ride get ya qualified
I'm just living my life I don't apologize
You know them Ommio boys bout a dollar sign
Money modified, every moral that you idolized
And we can go from maros to Lennox
Or tearing down 5th aves Uber's and lift cams
Get back on mistresses, sagging on benches
Yo girl was interested, my words a privileges
Ink out it's trust, all these improvs a lust
Take yo bitch out and fuck
Take my rent out her purse
Then I whoosa at Boa's
Break yo bottom for insurance
From flesho to Florence

She don't need a boat, she gone jump ship
I told her head first like a front flip
She gone go to work I'm up in the field
Nigga I done hit a lick
Imma take ya girl State 2 State
If ya girl choose up, she gone stay
I been knockin hoes State 2 State
