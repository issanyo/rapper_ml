[Verse 1]
Still leaning while I'm sipping
Screaming fuck a bitch
I thank God for my success
And I accept what it come with
I know the sacrifice this type of life actually is
But when I weigh my other options anything else don’t make sense
Screams, nightmares and dreams
And the story of my life it seem there ain't no in-betweens
Still plotting on a million hundred plus before I leave
God willing touch a billi that's just how a nigga think
On my own two, running this race just how I'm supposed to
Took back ownership for everything I sold dude
This is grinding, this is hustle in the old school
Don't be surprised when I roll, boo

[Hook]
I think I gotta problem in relationships
Tried to love a couple times but it ain't make no sense
Look I'm not tryna go to war with you, my dear
This time is real, don't let it be consumed by fear

I think I gotta problem in relationships
Tried to love a couple times but it ain't make no sense
Look I'm not tryna go to war with you, my dear
This time is real, don't let it be consumed by fear

See I got so much on my mind
But I just needed space and time
Know we got us here from somethin'
Everybody got their own assumptions
Stop wasting all your energy
Tryna find a new identity, for me

[Verse 2]
Damn, what the fuck is up?
See all this money got these bitches acting like they fell in love
And some of y'all niggas believe ‘em
But I'm not one of y'all
I'mma young nigga out here eating, just balling till I fall
Yea, solo in my 2-door
Never had to follow rules, if I want to then I do so
World famous, everywhere that you go
People taking pictures, imagine how your ego
Could run away, it could run away with you
Run you over and then stay with you
Slick words from a pretty bitch
I looked at her as I hit the spliff, and said

[Hook]

So material, why you so material?
Make it all about the sex, it should be something spiritual
I want the world, I'm not the man to make miracles
And in my mind it come that girls don't wanna marry you
Lost in this fast life, I know it's wrong
One day I come back round and prolly be gone
She say you balling but you all alone
And if you call bout a problem just dont call my phone
She like, you can't buy happiness
And that's true, but bitch I can't be average
To tell the truth don't really want it to be over with
There's just some things I got to go and get

[Hook]
