[Intro]
Its like 2 o'clock in the studio
Backed up on the leaks but my shit grasping
I'm back on you niggas though
I gots this 55 thousand so we gon do it like this
Uh, Hussle nigga
One take 2
Look, uh

[Verse 1]
Mac 11 on my dresser drawer
Model bitches like “Nipsey what’s the weapon for?"
Niggas tryna take, I give em nothin' less than war
So what’s understood there is no explanation for
Put the box in concrete, then put the safe in floor
Extra thick carpet, that’s what we made it for
Young niggas gettin' money is what I make it for
Play this out your range rover and Mercedes door
Uh
I graduated from havin' haters
Now I see it all as fake love, so don’t congratulate us
And thank god for my imagination
I seen the vision, i’m in it, and now i’m after greatness
I know that god got me so I practice patience
Most the time I look inside and
Find the answers waitin'
Tryna change my life but it’s aggravating
