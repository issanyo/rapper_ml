[Chorus]
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it
Roll up the weed
Everything's on the house fucking with me
And the money call nigga I'm on it
Nigga I'm from the streets
Bitches fuck and leave
And nigga I'm on it, nigga I'm on it

[French Montana]
Got the proposition, with no pot to piss in
We the hardest out, there ain't no competition
And I be's the jungle fever
Get the hard chiba, lower than a dark caesar
Unbeatable, unbelievable and the drug dealers love me told me I ain't need the blow
Here's a half a brick nigga you don't need to show
But I took it E-Z like I don't see the toll
Jewelery 3 below, niggas get pita rolled
Tunnel vision on that money I don't see a ho
I'm bout the chops, that shottie spark, blew up a body part

[Chorus]
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it
Roll up the weed
Everything's on the house fucking with me
And the money call nigga I'm on it
Nigga I'm from the streets
Bitches fuck and leave
And nigga I'm on it, nigga I'm on it

[Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, Uh
First nigga to put it down, rep the city the way I do it
Got these niggas rolling they drugs, bitches with they hand out
But we don't feed nothing but champagne and zigzag stuffers
Taking pictures with my campaign stuntin'
Nigga I ain't showin off, them niggas tuck they wings
I'm the fliest in my course
High as fuck at the game sittin courtside with my bad bitch and she roll up too
Just a couple names you should fear
No where near tired but had a good year
If bitches still choosing niggas hating on me
If you ain't talking paper that's another story

[Chorus]
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it
Roll up the weed
Everything's on the house fucking with me
And the money call nigga I'm on it
Nigga I'm from the streets
Bitches fuck and leave
And nigga I'm on it, nigga I'm on it

[Nipsey Hu$$le]
See I'm the type of nigga they know not to push
Plus I got them type of choppers leave Osama shook
Real crook, you would think I'm some type of Bush
Those bitches open their legs so I octopus
It's all money in, but that's just common sense
I wish that ya'll could see these checks I be depositin'
We drives in, bitches dive in
Bitch times 10, like fuck who I offend
We just do us, you just copy them
2 X's 1 L we the top 10
And I ain't never been to big about what the critics say
Unless the critics say that type of shit that get me baked

[Hook]

[Big Sean]
I just, I just, I just want the money and the power (I Do)
And I get em both 10,000 miles an hour (I Do)
That's why your girl would leave with me but you will not allow her
Fuck your lil section bitch I want the entire
My nigga Wiz roll up like we cripple respect
Man I bet she call big when I'm little
And she gone' call me big when she wiggle
Me and 2 hoes and I'm just chillin' in the middle (Like waddup though)
Bitch, your whole life is fictional
Your bitch want to play doctor on my dick she want my physical
Smokin' medical marijuana, my shit's medicinal
I love it, love it, love it
Bitch I love it unconditional (Boi)

[Chorus]
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it
Roll up the weed
Everything's on the house fucking with me
And the money call nigga I'm on it
Nigga I'm from the streets
Bitches fuck and leave
And nigga I'm on it, nigga I'm on it
