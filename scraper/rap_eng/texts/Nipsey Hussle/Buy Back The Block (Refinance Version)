[Intro: Rick Ross]
We had to refinance, this the refinanced version
Which is a good thing, so If you owe one fifty on it
You hit you a juug in the street, take them a 40 lump, now you owe one tenth
We refinancing this year, we paying everything off
Let's get in touch with all our debt owers

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Ayo D, we go foreign silly
Just my section might throw a billy, operation buy back the 60's
Gentrify the whole innercity, genocide the whole innercity
Niggas buying up every belly
Investments [?]
Roundtable tryna campfire
Told my niggas they was vampires
Never let 'em say jay finished
One strip mall got eight bidders
Build brands like Sean Diddy
Human hair coming from the East, niggas sellin' bundles [?]
By any means niggas gotta eat
Fat Burgers niggas gotta eat
Crenshaw since â€™85 got Jay Z off TMC
Every tape do a million plus
So tune car got ten up
Contracts not retroactive, big word but you get the message
Big checks go get the Checkers, we call it Rally
You call it Checkers
I fuck with wings but I'm not investing
Tell Rozay that I'm tryna network
Pop the trunk now, make the set work
James Brown gotta do your leg work
James Brown you gotta do your leg work

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
It's time to buy back the block, buy back the block
It's time to buy back the block, buy back the block
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
I'm 'bout to buy back the hood, buy back the hood

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
When bosses link up they make boss moves
Tryna buy a hundred houses tired of buying jewels
I done played with mills I'm tryna touch another digit
Tired of looking cool ain't nothing left to do, I did it
Boss Life construction, fuck it buy my whole hodd
When OG Johnny got the old hood lookin good
Used to sell bricks now we sellin' brick homes
[?] so we switched and got our hustle on
Money long, tryna own my whole city, mane
Start off with a block, we already did it mane
Ain't no loss, everything [?]
[?] bank and give my people homes
Thinking longterm, thinking like a boss
Before you shine gon' fix up your momma house
Buy back the block, it's time to open up shop
Boss up, [?] from bottom to top

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
It's time to buy back the block, buy back the block
It's time to buy back the block, buy back the block
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
I'm 'bout to buy back the hood, buy back the hood

[Verse 3: E-40]
(We gettin' money since Moby Dick was a goldfish)
[?], real estate
[?] mansions in the south, interest rate
I can make the booger sugar bounce (boing)
I used to have the sack in the droughts (coins)
More hop than a kangaroo pouch
I think I might franchise a Ralph's
Our Whole Foods are sproused
Loyal to my soil like a spouse
My diamonds twinkling, her pussy tingling
I'm dipped in gold, I'm kinging
I'm bonafide, he falsified
That nigga told, he singing
Bitch I'm the shit like I'm lactose
[?]
Bosses, lieutenants and admirals
Tacticals, choppers and calicos
In the Bay tryna get boxed that's why I stay hot
The cost of living is high
Everyday my people die
Lord knows I try, I see they tears in they eyes
I come from nothing to something
All of my life I been hustling
Me and my bro's at the top
We gon' buy back the block
BIATCH

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
It's time to buy back the block, buy back the block
It's time to buy back the block, buy back the block
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
I'm 'bout to buy back the hood, buy back the hood

[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
Take the jet up in NYC
Couple J's and some jeans to match the Balmain tees
Bout to buy back the black
100 bricks in the trunk
Leave 'em layed in the pavement, you know we slayin' the Bronx
And now I'm sorry, I been killin' these niggas
Now I got me a complex and I ain't feelin' these niggas
I just took a vacation, I had a pool by the beach
In the mediterranean [?]
Put the streets on my back, now I'm back in them streets
Used to pack a Mac in the back of them Cadillac seats
And that's word to Big Punisher, I be sonin' these niggas
In the dome with the roof gone, the sun's on a nigga
Bet that leather reclining and them diamonds be dancing
Bout to buy back the block and build a 30 room mansion
When that money be talkin' you know I gotta respond
I'ma make me a Belly and go buy bacl the Bronx

[Verse 5: Rick Ross]
FED's follow my cars call me a person of interest
The Lord is my witness that I have perfect intentions
God is the greatest, he keeps me under surveillance
Powerful statements was such a wonderful cadence
The housing was public, my mother's love was amazing
Neighborhood, violence and devil, never complained to the mayor
Trash on the corner, be in the bundles contagious
And all the blunts I be blowin' [?]
Business endeavours, we killers forever
I need [?]
All the homes that I own, I open my doors
For ones that I call my own
And pray you do it with yours

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
It's time to buy back the block, buy back the block
It's time to buy back the block, buy back the block
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
It's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
I'm 'bout to buy back the hood, buy back the hood
