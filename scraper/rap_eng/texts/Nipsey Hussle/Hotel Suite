(Verse 1)
All that
Yeah, look really
I just got this dough in my pocket
All these hoes be jockin'
There's weight on my shoulder
All these clothes on my closet
V12 engines, beautiful women
This life is a blast nigga when you're the one winning
Liquor in my kidney 'gnac when I'm sippin'
Black Escalade with all of my niggas
Calls from them prisons from careless decisions
Tryna upgrade your livin
Tryna spin off your pivot
I relate though my nigga
So I shoot you that green dot
We fuckin' these bitches 2013 Aaliyahs
We fly to these countries, in 501 Levis
I'm so Westside, nigga, "ariba, ariba"
These niggas be hatin', really I see why
100 a show so gas up the G5
That's one of my goals nigga
You know I complete mine
I think and I do it it's a part of my design

(Chorus)
Yeah
In a hotel suite with a famous freak, yeah
Tryna do her thing
She ain't even blink, uh
Took her off her feet
Put her on that sink, aye
Everyday by choice
But she came for me, look
So I got that flight you should probably chief
Shots of Patron make your body weak, look
And I ain't gonn' stop till we fuck up your sheets, look
Then I wake you up and just fuck up your sleep

(Verse 2)
Young nigga with no conscience
Corporate cards in my wallet
Bitch tell me I'm awesome
I'm like "duh bitch I'm all Slauson"
Life short there's no promise
Party hard like New Orleans
Crack a pint in ?
But I ain't never start snorrin'
?
Stop looking that could be yours
I just wrote a fucking book
It's to take your money for source
All I know is get more
All I know is just flourish
Started off on that porch
Now it's schrimps and pork
Crab and lobster on Collins
Niggas all skipped college
Ended up as them bosses
All I know is we poppin'
All I know is I got it
TMC that's my logic
Marathon ain't no stoppin'
That's the way I get all this
Los Angeles raw shit
County jail top ? shit
Courts ?, gang brawl shit
Smoke is smellin' like dog shit
How you feelin' like uh shit
I gotta go home I gotta get up out
Then you scratch your head find your route
You gotta figure it out
Gotta buy a Benz gotta buy a house
Stay confident while you try it out
Really do this type of shit
That these rapping niggas be lying 'bout
Be lying 'bout, they trickin' hoes
They flying out
Bitches callin' me like "come through"
I'm like "yeah boo, I'ma wear you out"

(Chorus)
Yeah
In a hotel suite with a famous freak, yeah
Tryna do her thing
She ain't even blink, uh
Took her off her feet
Put her on that sink, aye
Everyday by choice
But she came for me, look
So I got that flight you should probably chief
Shots of Patron make your body weak, look
And I ain't gonn' stop till we fuck up your sheets, look
Then I wake you up and just fuck up your sleep
