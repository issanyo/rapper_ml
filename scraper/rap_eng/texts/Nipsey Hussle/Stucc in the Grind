(Verse 1 : Nipsey Hussle)
I can feel the vibe Hussle on the rise
This lil light of mine I'm gon' let it shine
All she want is time, all she want is time
Look me in my eyes call me on my lies
Lock the city down til' the summertime
Time to slice these niggas up some humble pie
Caravan of foreigns let my youngin' drive
Elevate my game for the hundreth time
You could hold me down thru these troubled times
Or be another victim to my stubborn pride
Hold down through these troubled times, be another victim to my stubborn pride

(Chorus)
Stuck in the grind, Stuck in the grind, I'm stuck in the grind
Look me in my eyes call me on my lies
I'm stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind

(Verse 2)

Middle of the night kitchen lights is on
Roll me up a Bacc then I light the stove
Told her stay calm when the crises on
Say I die alone, I say my life a poem
Hyde Park Hussle speaking hyperbole
Translation, get the money never wife a hoe
Took this four already now its time to go
Shoulder full already where these stripes should go
Crash got opinions how my life should go I'm screaming fuck em' they could suck a dick and die tonight you know
Bullets, rain on em' cut the life support
My section ride for sport every night of course
Niggas dying everyday that's the price of war
Gang members spending thousands at the nicest stores
Levitate on five star luxury, every time I ride shit come for me

(Chorus)
Stuck in the grind, Stuck in the grind, I'm stuck in the grind
Look me in my eyes call me on my lies
I'm stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind

(Verse 3)

Make a movie take the top off
Bout to cross over like Hot Sauce
On this gutter shit I never hopped off, most calculated move by far
Always with a model and a fly car
30 thousand for the python, rocking knee high, drinking white wine
Listening to In My Lifetime, in the night time
Looking at the city skyline, getting sky high
Took the lil' bitch to Popeye, she was top 5
Excitement that she get from pop life could never top mine
Once you get the hustle locked down you can stockpile
Level another notch now, like its stock now
Everytime I take the top down she arch her eyebrows
Turning up the music high now, she feel alive now
Love me like we from a small town, lets make a mall round
You splurge, I splurge
We ball later and we ball now

(Chorus)
Stuck in the grind, Stuck in the grind, I'm stuck in the grind
Look me in my eyes call me on my lies
I'm stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind

(Verse 4)
Ain't no going back once them lights on you
Left the dorm in the middle of the night homie
Affidavits going viral thats yo' life homie
Ain't no point even tryna lie homie
This go out to all the SNY homies
This is death before dishonor, you should die homie
Fuck you niggas you disrespected the tribe homie
Rule deprived its written all in your eyes homie

(Chorus)
Stuck in the grind, Stuck in the grind, Im stuck in the grind
Look me in my eyes call me on my lies
I'm stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind
