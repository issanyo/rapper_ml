Featuring Dubb & Tai Phillips

(Verse)
Yea all that stress on my brain like
Poker face, I’m in the game right
We done with the beat, maybe 8 nights
Sure promethazine when they strike flight
Let me get on my phone, let get in my zone
I be saying to myself just leave a nigga alone
I be bagging a few, got some vibe in the building
Got some stacking still runnin, got some lot with building
Close to the side, nigga know that they ain’t frontin with the flow I provide
Yah, notice how I started and I flow everywhere
That miaralo style like wet in a brown
And it’s all money getting and yo girls is in charge
Hoes in ménage but her bones carde blanche
Ain’t no matter, taking suits ‘cus they know we the ones
Act with these niggas, well I’m chosen of course
No 3-60’s, pullin into er
When I do drop I’mma blow past niggas
And I toe tag niggas ike I told er before
Got flow, got whores
Got dope, get more
Fuck mine, get yours
And the show just started, nigga hold your applause
Tryna get to my spot
Look, you gotta go on, floss
I put the 6 on stop, I was runnin through tires like chicks on tour
You left em out the game, you can bet your bottom dollar that I sit on floor
Leave em out the fight, you can bet your bottom dollar sweat hit my hoes

(Pre-Hook)
Won’t take no loss, won’t take days off
We go so hard, until we fall
Won’t take no loss, won’t take days off
We go so hard, until we fall

(Hook)
A nigga used to dream, my reality’s a dream now
Nigga used to dream, my reality’s a dream now
I’m livin out my dreams now
Livin out my dreams now now now

(Verse)
Sittin in the trap like dance on a killa
Couple grams to a couple hundred grand
I grew up in a town they don’t make it out of
If you black you don’t live to see a mill
You see I’m 21, you done won the lottery
Talkin friends, when the streets there
Took a lot from me, I washed up from a robbery
Like the name 4657239 be state property
Yea, you had a dream, now you livin out a nightmare
You almost met a little nigga, you was like that
Like you released it, it’s in another life, yea
Yea, and it’s quite clear
All you niggas was a little bit of downers
And yo household niggas just silence
You was your own mother and your father
How the hell you supposed to know what to do when nobody showed you the ropes
All they showed you was pistols and dope
Game flash and a man with no hope
Where everything had been a different hook
Make it out and they, what you into her?
You own movie’s over but yo niggas good
Niggas do they self, make it understood
It’s just a fake ground, full of loose wings
Die for the color of yo shoe strings
Wish I had it different with a few things
You made a lot of rap, but I had a hook dream
From El Segundo, Slauson
Me and Nips, we in the office
Never takin no losses
Check yo garbage, nigga, like marbles

(Pre-Hook)
Won’t take no loss, won’t take days off
We go so hard, until we fall
Won’t take no loss, won’t take days off
We go so hard, until we fall

(Hook)
A nigga used to dream, my reality’s a dream now
Nigga used to dream, my reality’s a dream now
I’m livin out my dreams now
Livin out my dreams now now now
