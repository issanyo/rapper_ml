Oooh
Oh-oh

(spoken)
Hey, Josh. I want to look good for you tonight. So I'm gonna get in touch with my feminine side. 

(sung)
Uh

It's the sexy getting ready song
The sexy getting ready song
I'm primpin' and pluckin'
I'm brushin' and rubbin'
The sexy getting ready song

First I make
Everything shiny and smooth (Oh, yeah)
'Cause I want my body
To be so soft for you (Bye-bye, skin)

I'm gonna make this night
One you'll never forget (Ass blood)
'Cause, boy, I know you like
An hourglass silhouette

(spoken)
Let's see how the guys get ready. 

(sung)
It's the sexy getting ready song
The sexy getting ready song
I'm fluffin' and flouncin'
I'm gigglin' and layin'
Sexy getting ready song

[NIPSEY HUSSLE]
Hey, look, hop on my—
With that tight little dress
Then turn that ass around
Like you're trying to impress them

(spoken)

It's the sexy getting ready song
The sexy getting ready song
It's the sexy getting ready song
Body rolls are really hard
It's the sexy getting ready song
The sexy getting ready song
