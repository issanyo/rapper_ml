[Intro: T.I.]
Search far and wide
And I bet you'll never find a lil' nigga with a heart this size
Keep me separate and apart from all these frauds
They see me get appalled, you know why?

[Hook: Victoria Monet]
I'm about my issue babe
And you can tell by my name, yeah
I'm about my issue babe
Whatever stands in my way, yeah
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Every time I take
Penitentiary chance all I take
God with me I'ma find my way
Nigga they ain't even fuck around nowaday
Feds came in the house, say they found my yay
A couple handguns and a new SK
Bag full of weed and some Grand Marnier
But fuck it though, I gotta keep my grandma straight
Catch a case, getaway by the grace of God
Standing on the corner slanging slabs of hard
Just a young soldier no camouflage
Man them niggas ain't tough they're just playing hard
I pull a fuck nigga card on GP
Between 'em make 11 mill and peewee
We spray your block, turn around, pull up, repeat
And let everybody look at it on TV
Man I'm certified and I'm gangster
Getting on the rock like my banker
I'm in the gated mansion, no neighbor
New Italian suits on my hangers
I got Cuban links and diamond rings
Solitaires and shiny things
Aye fuck how tough you tryin' to seem
Come try the king, cause I'm about my

[Hook: Victoria Monet]
I'm about my issue babe
And you can tell by my name, yeah
I'm about my issue babe
Whatever stands in my way, yeah
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Have you ever heard
The point blank blast of a Mossberg?
Whole block never mind like you've not heard
Lil' nigga keep it moving like they not scared
And out here, it's do or die
Kill after kill in the coupe so fly
Man the niggas over there tried to shoot your guy
Man the fully automatic .22 go by like damn
And as fly as I am
It's hard for you to tell how high I am
Oh my God damn
You see it don't believe it still
And all I ever had
Was a Glock 23 and an extra mag
Presidential weed and a extra bag
Two or three bad bitches on the jet to France
We set to land and I get to the plan
How to violate your little sexy ass
Then get in the Jag, the little Vette crash
Just ride this till you get to splash
You a wild girl, go cowgirl
Keep the noise down, you loud girl
Turn down, don't know how girl
No white girl cause

[Hook: Victoria Monet]
I'm about my issue babe
And you can tell by my name, yeah
I'm about my issue babe
Whatever stands in my way, yeah
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Couldn't listen to niggas they said I dream too much
Heart fucked up, guess I seen too much
Numb to it now, bring a gun to it now
When this shit pop I'ma run to it now
Niggas talk loud but they dumb to announce
Read he got away so he tryna play it down
When they kick down your door and they run through your house
Cuffs on your wrists and they cussin' you out
It'll make sense then
Telling you that they got your prints then
What's the reward for your risk then?
Niggas game goofy, this just in
Time after time
Know we need a light nigga, blind lead the blind
Why do we ride?
Grind to provide nigga, not just to shine
Blood in my eyes
Stress on my mind, let a fly nigga fly
9 on my side
God I'm your child but times are so wild
Playing with me
I'ma draw down and I'ma show out
If it gotta go down
I'm prepared to go now cause

[Hook: Victoria Monet]
I'm about my issue babe
And you can tell by my name, yeah
I'm about my issue babe
Whatever stands in my way, yeah
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da
