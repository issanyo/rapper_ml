[Verse 1]
Initials on my wallets, smoking with my stylist
Custom German plates on all my cars, cause bitch I'm balling
All in burning crosses, which royalty regardless
Honestly I'm honored just to represent the progress
Distant as I seem to you, I know what I mean to you
Martin Luther King Jr., Hustle let me dream through you
When I told my scheme to em, told me that I seem stupid
Empty engines need fueling, y'all was like my theme music
Now I keep them links Cuban, money talk I speak fluent
Everybody buying Rolies, you can ask my team's children
Life is but a dream to us, life is why they need music
Got em wrapped around the corner, looking like Supreme threw it
Cause when you cook it right, the fiends use it
Come take a look at life how we view it
You gotta start off in a cheap buick
Then book a flight and see to it
That's first class, my first pass
It's big shit nigga like when birds pass
Them 7 grams I got to a bird fast
On Brynhurst Ave start busting on my church pass
DOA, "you gon' be okay" that's what my granny used to say
But I ain't see a way
Sitting in the county jail I pray I see today
Most successful nigga got a "S" up on his face
Fuck the world, fuck the world
They hate a young nigga that could fuck your girl
They hate a real nigga when he touch a mill
Hate you if you fake, but hate you more if you real
