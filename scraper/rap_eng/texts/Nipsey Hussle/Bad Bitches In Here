[Verse 1: Nipsey Hu$$le]
I got all this lucci, you should come seduce me
I ain't never tricking but I could buy that coochie
Balling that's my routine
Real niggas do things
Like double park the 600 Benz in front of Stussy
Always fuck a new bitch, always buying new things
New cars, new rims, new watch, new rack
I'm fly, drop this new thing, you can't pop if you sing
You're thirsty for that lose change
We grind, flock, and shoot things
I got all this lucci, you should come seduce me
I ain't never tricking but I could buy that coochie
Real niggas do things
Like pull up in that new Range
White beamer, 2 chainz, smoking with your boo thang

[Hook: TeeFlii]
Excuse my liquor, but it's some bad bitches in here
Excuse the smoke in the air, but it's some bad bitches in here
