[Verse 1: Bino Rideaux]
I still remember being poor
I still remember making money unemployed
I love pussy but I love the money more
She wasn't loyal, all that money came before you
I got shit I gotta take up with the lawyer
I do drugs sometimes, it make me feel immortal
Don’t try to love me, I won't put that pressure on you
'Cause I ain’t gon' play no parts in what I’m going through
I got money sitting in some places I can’t even go with you
All my energy be on a different level when I’m close to you
She ain’t built to live this life, this life will get the most of you
'Cause I got different type of drama in me oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
I’m at a point in life right now, I look for shit to motivate me
'Cause I been waking up on bad notes, I can’t control it lately
'Cause I was raised in the streets, I came up a soldier baby
And if they catch a nigga unfocused, they supposed to take me

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
That’s just how it go, when it come to love
That’s just how it go, when it come to war
Ain’t shit fair, ain’t shit fair, ain’t shit fair, I was right there
That’s just how it go, when it come to love
That’s just how it go, when it come to war
Ain’t shit fair, ain’t shit fair, ain’t shit fair, I was right there

[Verse 2: Bino Rideaux]
Now I lay my strap down on the table
We the only ones from underneath who wasn’t able
She gon' hop up in the mix cause she ain’t living stable
We done got it up and going without the jumper cables
And now the block sit right on top the label
We can do it how you wanna, just be honest with me
I can’t fuck with none of these niggas, I can’t find it in me
Ain’t a nigga with more loyalty and honor than me, ahh

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Now I lay my strap down on the table
I’ve been lost confused too fucked up in this world enabled
And I relied on you as distraction to compensate it
Self destruction don't explain it, it’s like drugs and I’m too faded
Can’t put love before this greatness
When I’m gone I ain’t celebrate this
Worked too hard on this foundation
To get caught up in your matrix
I got tired of speaking your language
You would smile to see my soul anguish
I’m just tryna change my location
When I drive it’s like you grow anxious, damn

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
That’s just how it go, when it come to love
That’s just how it go, when it come to war
Ain’t shit fair, ain’t shit fair, ain’t shit fair, I was right there
That’s just how it go, when it come to love
That’s just how it go, when it come to war
Ain’t shit fair, ain’t shit fair, ain’t shit fair, I was right there
