I like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches
I like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches
I like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches
I like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches

Look, young hussle on that bullshit
Hopping out the regal, burner with the full clip
Summer time, murder gangs going back to back
Fly crip- what's on my belt cause half a stack
I’ve been balling, nigga reach I'm a handle that
Back when me and F and J Stone was selling candle wax
I’m the mother fucking truth, nigga that’s a fact
And if I fuck your baby momma, can you handle that?
Look, the west? nigga, that’s a rap
You ain’t eating with us, you gone have the scraps
Struck out nigga, every time you at the bat
Niggas can't compete with us with them type of stats
Niggas can't compete with us with these type of racks
Fiends tend to blow your beeper up, with this type of crack
Niggas trying to get their license back
Me, i’m trying to get my lifers back
Niggas couldn’t keep the chopper on the riffle rack
I’m a driver and a shooter, still, in spite on that
Lightbulb... hustle, look you might could rap
Nightclubs, I know a couple that we might could pack
Try and fail, go to jail, quit life of rap
Rhetorically I ask myself "what type of life is that?"
No, you knew better, but you settle
I stepped it up a level double up on my endeavors
So I'm broke never, i’m a rich rolling rebel
Clever as the devil, pull strings like gepetto
I've been real from the get-go
You’re green like a gecko
When your name gain weight your ex hoes can’t let go!
Hello? hanging up when you say your name
Play it too much to not know the game
Heartbroken, frank ocean on that novocaine
You know this change, but I won’t explain, look!
Nigga crip that flip the blueprint that hova lay
Ten thousand cash four tickets no overlay
And i’ll be in your city with the bros today
Presidential car service with the motorcade
Road to the riches, now you know the way
Run this money marathon at a owners pace
You ain't a real nigga without a goal to chase
And a yellow bone bitch with some toes to paint

I like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches
I like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches
I like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches
I like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches
