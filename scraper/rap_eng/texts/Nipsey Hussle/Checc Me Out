[Intro:]
Yeah yeah man, y'all already know what the fuck is up man
If it's music on the street you know who got it first man
My home boys
LA leakers drop that shit from Nipsey

[Hook: Dom Kennedy]
New Nipsey Hussle, (Checc me out)
You in trouble, (Checc me out)
Pay us now, (Checc me out)
Or pay me double, (Checc me out)
You Nipsey Hustle, (Checc me out)
You Nipsey Hustle, (Checc me out)
You Nipsey Hustle, (Checc me out)
Nigga fuck it, (Checc me out)

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Nigga fuck, I came from nothing
Shoot outs in public, ridin buses
Buyin' Benz's, was buying buckets
Knock me out of my grind that's what they wasn't
My life was ugly and I got money
Caught a glimpse of that, that's not for me
She say she love me, she think she love me
She want my money, I think she funny
Uh, a-all bad bitches
V12 engines
Broke niggas die slow
While the rich get richer

[Bridge: Dom Kennedy (Nipsey Hussle)]
We on the shaw, (Checc me out)
Above the law, (Checc me out)
I sag my pants, (Checc me out)
To show my draws, (Checc me out)
This how we ball, (Checc me out)
Slauson mall, (Checc me out)
I fuck em' once, (Checc me out)
And never call, (Checc me out)
Nigga

[Hook: Nipsey Hussle + (Cobby Supreme)]
All bad bitches, (Show money in by the way)
V-12 engines, (Supreme)
Broke niggas die slow, (Itâ€™s on yo feet)
While the rich get richer

[Verse 2: Cobby Supreme]
Balenciagas, no Gucci problems
Get money with Timers, Louie V persona
Hit a nigga with a llama
You want them problems
I do my thang in the kitchen
See that's a Pyrex vision
And I roll with the riches
Stay flipping those bitches
Stay away from the snitches
That's how you get those stitches
Only fuck with my circle
No square ass niggas
And we don't smoke on purple
Only Kush out the Benzes
Where a nigga come from?
My niggas is so relentless
We don't play no games
Send a nigga to the dentist
Went to the ICU, that's how I see you
All about my business
All money business bitches

[Hook: Nipsey Hussle]

All bad bitches
V-12 engines
Broke niggas die slow
While the rich get richer

[Bridge: Dom Kennedy]
I'll be real, check me out
All money in, check me out
That's the business, checc me out
In the Benz, check me out
We do it big, check me out
Fucking twins, check me out
We fuck that rich, check me out
Please come again, check me out
Please come again, check me out
Please come again, check me out
That's what I told her, check me out
Please come again, check me out
Please come again, check me out
Please come again, check me out
All PM, check me out
All money in, check me out nigga

Y'all see this shit, uh
The Los Angeles leakers
Everything I operate go fast
