Forever on some fly shit
Ima draw the line you niggas pick who you gon ride with
Simple ass niggas happy cuz they fucced my side bitch but she just mad at me cuz she ain't the one I ride with
Drop down and pick yo heart up off the floor girl and quit trying to convince me that yo ass is not a hole girl
Wonder why I'm not picking up my phone, well the last 12 months I done travled across the whole world
And niggas hopin' ima flop but meanwhile I been gettin paid on every stop
Naybahood nigga still good on every blocc, still bust on any nigga actin like he can't get shot, Hold up
I got an extra clip for the Johnnys still
Burner on my lap only difference is the wheels
Murder is a fact when you out here in the feild cuz jealous niggas dealin with emotions only bitches feel
9 times out of 10 they just want a friend, but I been real before rap so I won't pretend
Tell um to they face all the flaws that im noticin'
I never fucced with yo type and I won't begin
And its "Oh he on his high horse" but bottom line bitch nigga this is my horse
Never killed nothin you just wait on it to die first but this gon be the season that you vulture niggas fly north
I drop classic after classic, streets on fire soft rappers can't match this
I ain't doin features even if they got the cash, Me and Blacc Sam ballin out the shop on Slauson Ave, Look
Its way more profit in these clothes so I give away this music and make double back in shows I 360 myself then I exercise control
IHussle.com my digital Louis Store
Tell um catch up now or find out later
I'm revenge in the form of success to all haters
Where a Benz is a form of respect to spectators and your friends keep it real for a sec and switch later
In this material world the thought is contagious and securitys created cuz niggas is less famous, and
Most the time they just in it for these hoes so its fuccin up they lives when she see theres no control
