[Hook]
Why you niggas outside without no gun
You think this shit is a game?
But no, no, not at all
I'll hop out gunnin' and show you niggas I ain't playin'
Pull the trigger, shoot that nigga
Make sure that you get him
Cause bullets ain't got no names
Pull the trigger, shoot that nigga
Make sure that you get him
Cause bullets ain't got no names
Why you niggas outside without no gun
You think this shit is a game?
But no, no, not at all
I'll hop out gunnin' and show you niggas I ain't playin'
Cause bullets ain't got no names

[Verse 1]
Why you niggas act as if your body built to survive the shots
Knowing damn well after I get crackin' you gon' be outlined in chalk
The sun is shining and still it's raining
If you don't wanna get wet, then boy stop hanging
My hood is warring, so ain't no warnings
Niggas'll take your life, now your moms is mourning
I done seen it happen when we got crackin'
Six minutes later they got right back at us
Ten minutes later we was right back at them
My burner so hot it put a hole in my mattress
Bullets ain't got no names

[Hook]
Why you niggas outside without no gun
You think this shit is a game?
But no, no, not at all
I'll hop out gunnin' and show you niggas I ain't playin'
Pull the trigger, shoot that nigga
Make sure that you get him
Cause bullets ain't got no names
Pull the trigger, shoot that nigga
Make sure that you get him
Cause bullets ain't got no names

[Verse 2]
The sun is shining and still it's raining
And you ain't gotta ask where he from, just spray him
By the look up on his face, you could tell he bangin'
See the look up on his face when that thing start ringin'
One down, two to go, suspect usual
Murder scene, the routine ain't new to you
Switch cars, double back, one down, double that
Yellow tape the gate where they niggas at
Some niggas need a bullet before they learn they lesson
You still ain't got your gun, you ain't got the message
My enemies they know, they say he got extras
When I come through I only got one question
("Why you niggas keep hangin' out?")

[Hook]
Why you niggas outside without no gun
You think this shit is a game?
But no, no, not at all
I'll hop out gunnin' and show you niggas I ain't playin'
Pull the trigger, shoot that nigga
Make sure that you get him
Cause bullets ain't got no names
Pull the trigger, shoot that nigga
Make sure that you get him
Cause bullets ain't got no names
