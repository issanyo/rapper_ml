[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Easy to spot me like Lil Yachty
Red ambient light luminate the big body
Bro hand me a sprite na fuck it out climb me
Had to rise from the grave but ain't a nigga out climb me
Take it to trial and beat all charges
Pull up in Rarri and ball hard
Watching me take this shit way farther
Now they can tell I was way smarter

[Hook: Bino Rideaux]
Cause you came from hood things
This life it got good things about it too
And now we push Blue Wraith
Got the whole hood singing about you
And you can't stop
Oh no you can't stop no, oh no you can't stop no
All that pressure but it can't defeat you
They don't know the block like we do
They don't know the block like we do
They don't know the block like we do
They don't know the block like we do

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Authentic ain't the word I'm on 63rd
Tween Brynhurst and Vic where all them killers were
Burgundy your curb burgundy your curb
Hit the gas and swerve hit the gas and swerve
When it's time to purge I can send the work but I don't send em I go wit em cause I risk adverse
And this shit realer than life when you raised so fucked up you start feeling this right
When you seen so much death you start dealing with Christ
If you ever make it out you give em different different advice
Put my truth in this music hope I'm givin' em light
Just another flawed human trying to get this shit right
Love a strong passion but resist it with pride
Too much honor in my heart to let that mickey shit fly
750li count another hunnid thou while I ride
Stonewashed Faraga like peanut butter on rye
Real shit a nigga touchin' the sky everyday I wake up I refine
You see me drinking alkene
By any means i gave you a design
I even titled it I put it on my part of the shine
Keep shit going every morning I try
Long as it's late model foreign I'm fine
Lot of pain don't expect me to cry
Lot of fails still expect me to try
I'm from the gang they expect me to die

[Hook: Bino Rideaux]
Cause you came from hood things
This life it got good things about it too
And now we push Blue Wraith
Got the whole hood singing about you
And you can't stop
Oh no you can't stop no, oh no you can't stop no
All that pressure but it can't defeat you
They don't know the block like we do
They don't know the block like we do
They don't know the block like we do
They don't know the block like we do

[Verse 3: Dave East]
We ain't have no cable but with cane was able
To buy my momma groceries before she made the table
I seen niggas die over a conversation
Young with a gun speedin' through life with no kinds of patience
You can smell the murder while the kids playin'
Enemies on top of enemies the pigs hate us
New nina open your chest up like Vick's Vapor
Ballin' in New York they confusin' me with a Knick's player
Burgundy your block burgundy your block
Was servin' smokers in the spot till cuzzo served a cop
He ain't look like no police he bought it by the piece
His daughter I call her my niece so she gon' always eat
I'm focused like Mohammed with a speed bag
Ski masks, you ain't seeing faces when we need that
Arm and Hammer powder in my finger nails
Got more stripes than a Adidas sale I seen a jail
Was eating tuna as a I read my mail
Everywhere I go now they feel me like they reading braille
I might be a demon I seen shit I never need to tell
Two guns up, Lennox to King Park, two thumbs up
Beans and Bleek, Who want what?
We was off surviving off of samples
Homies dying lit the block up like a blunt with the candle
So fuck your code of ethics we just showin' progression
All that tough shit out your window the minute you show your weapon
Harlem
