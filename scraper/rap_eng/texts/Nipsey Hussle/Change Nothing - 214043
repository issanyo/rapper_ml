[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Don't ever talk about the shit I'm bout' to do
Don’t ever lie to hoes, I just tell the truth
Don’t ever put the pussy on a pedestal
This money is the motive, everything after the revenue
I swear to God that’s what you’d better do
‘Cause in this life, it ain’t no tellin’ what’s ahead of you
These niggas done went Federal
From young reputable niggas killin’, it’s all sectional
Now this is the reality we wrestle with
Where every nigga down to die for what he represent
Where every murder is a mission rooted in revenge
You make it out and in one peace, you set precedent
And then you start accumulating presidents
You lookin’ like a legend, especially when your record spins
And you pull up in a 6 with a set of twins
Ain’t like I never thought I’d see you in the set again

[Hook]
Please, I’m gettin’ paid, but that ain’t change nothin’
That ain’t change nothin’ …
Look, I’m gettin’ cheese, but that ain’t change nothin’
That ain’t change nothin’, my nigga…

Look, I’m gettin’ paid, but that don’t mean nothin’
That don’t mean nothin’ …
Look, I’m gettin’ cheese, but that don’t mean nothin’
That don’t mean nothin’ …

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
I swore to tell the world if I made it out
The truth about these LA streets and all that they about
The paranoid emotions, will they stake us out
When we pull up thick in some foreign shit out the Geisha House?
The losses that we took when they raid the house
The bitches that I seen when I laid it out
The only important thing is the paper route
The model, I embodied the prophesy as I played it out
Look, smilin’ faces rockin’ diamond bracelets
Murder cases, duck probation when your pockets major
I’m stuntin’ in somethin’ that cost a lot of paper
I ain’t fuckin’ with nothin’ that don’t look like a spaceship
Look, now that’s the realest shit I ever spoke
Pull up at the shopping centre with a centrefold
My windows up, my ceiling’s closed
Choppers still on me if you didn’t know, nigga…

[Outro] And at this point, just take it to the next level Niggas they grindin' so hard Came so far Travel the world Got all type of money And this shit still don't stop nigga All I see is new opportunities, new arises Real young niggas came up from nothin' This is how I live
