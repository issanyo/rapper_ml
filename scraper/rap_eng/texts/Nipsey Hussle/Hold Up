[Intro]
1500 or Nothin'
15, uh

[Verse 1: Marion Band$]
Everyday I think lucrative, it always got to be progress
If it ain't about that money, then it ain't a part of my process
Meetin' with the bosses over lobster tails
Strategizin' our next move, conclusion is prevail
Bitches that hold yo' shit up, bitches that fuck yo' shit up
She call and she wanna lick up
But I'm busy hittin' this liquor
Bitch, I'm chasin' money, you don't deserve a description
It take some sacrifices to get in this position
When my well was dry, I was still makin' my wishes
I was ridin' around, I was riskin' it
But if I didn't do it, I wouldn't get this shit
Up late nights, I'm an owl too
There's a few things that I value
Money, trust, respect, loyalty and my crew

[Hook: Marion Band$]
Politickin' with my niggas about this money, bitch, hold up
I had to drop my bitch, ‘cause I don't need no hold-ups
Walk right in VIP, we don't do no hold-ups
Get too close, I got some killers with me that'll tell you
Hold up, hold up (tell ya)
Hold up, hold up (tell ya)
Hold up, hold up
You say you want this money
Nigga, then what's the hold up?
If you really 'bout this paper, then what's the (Hold up?)

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Nip Hussle the Great back
Came up, you can't hate that
Self-made, you can't take that
Yeah, self-made, you can't make that
Some say I need a record deal
I need a cosign, I need a Dre track
But all the time I had a mean flow
I had a cold grind and that's a great match
Payback, fuck hoes and I make racks
And my pockets gon' stay fat
‘Cause I merk beats and I slay tracks
Payback, wrist rocky like A$AP
Stay strapped like I'm Arab
And in a world of lies I still state facts
Lame-ass, hatin' niggas take flame baths
All you really doin' when you runnin' your mouth
Is tellin' me where to aim at (guncock)
Duck, nigga! Fuck-bitches and fuck-niggas
If you ain't talkin' bread, then I don't fuck with you
(Gunshot) Hussle!

Hold up, hold up (tell ya)
Hold up, hold up

If you really 'bout this paper, then what's the (Hold up?)

[Verse 3: Marion Band$]
Fifteen, uh, I'm goin' all in it no matter the outcome
They told me I had it and now I am relapsin'
And how could you X me out? I am not Malcolm
And how could you doubt me? You heard my first album
And who had the nerve to think I was done with
I left the game graciously for you to run with
Like that of a blueprint, go on and front then
Time that you had, and this what you come with?
If you want it to work out, exercise it
Nigga, and if you want to see it, visualize it
That was me that we been discussin'
And it was the thought, they thought I was bluffin'
I know that they waitin' to see what I come with
I told you my best and I feel my toughness
Nevertheless I'm who they fuck with
I'm the go-to guy, you niggas go too shy
No Kanye's or Common's
I'm comin', and don't ask me who I like in the game
Right now, I'll say no comments; Yung
