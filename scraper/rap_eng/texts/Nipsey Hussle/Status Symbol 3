[Chorus: Buddy]
Almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot where I was goin'
I been driving, I been smokin'
Almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot what I was drinkin'
What the hell have I been thinkin'

[Post-Chorus: Buddy]
Now I'm just ridin' through the city
Now I'm just ridin' through the city
And ain't nobody rollin' with me
And ain't nobody rollin' with me
It ain't a problem, I'm gon get it
It ain't a problem, I'm gon get it
This is a trip, trip, trip, trip
Ridin' 'round smokin' by myself
Don't you know I do it so well
Dollar signs all on my head
Rollin' solo, dolo, this a trip, trip, trip, trip

[Chorus: Buddy]
Almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot where I was goin'
I been drivin', I been smokin'
Almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot what I was drinkin'
What the hell have I been thinkin'

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Rappin' for my section, roll with my protection
Who gon' die next? Ain't tryna get elected
Ridin' by myself, time for self reflection
I feel like a young boss nigga that's thankful for his blessings
I can't even lie, I ain't even flexin'
Block for me black man, know they tryna stretch us
I ain't tryna preach, I ain't tryna lecture
When you make your first mil' in cash, you gon' feel the pressure
Just wanna feel the thrust, wanna feel the texture
Wanna feel the drop top breeze, wanna feel successful
Wanna change the game, never chase a message
Never stop grindin', cherish no possessions
We ain't get accepted, we just reinvested
Things that I expected 'cause we ain't even set trip
60th to Megan, Choppers for protection
FBI invests us, but they can't arrest us
Almost (almost)

[Chorus: Buddy]
Almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot where I was goin'
I been driving, I been smokin'
Almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot what I was drinkin'
What the hell have I been thinkin'

[Post-Chorus: Buddy]
Now I'm just ridin' through the city
Now I'm just ridin' through the city
And ain't nobody rollin' with me
And ain't nobody rollin' with me
It ain't a problem, I'm gon get it
It ain't a problem, I'm gon get it
This is a trip, trip, trip, trip
Ridin' 'round smokin' by myself
Don't you know I do it so well
Dollar signs all on my head
Rollin' solo, dolo, this a trip, trip, trip, trip

[Chorus: Buddy]
Almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot where I was goin'
I been driving, I been smokin'
Almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot what I was drinkin'
What the hell have I been thinkin'

[Bridge: Buddy & Nipsey Hussle]
Now I'm swervin', yeah I'm swervin'
Now I'm splurin', yeah I'm splurgin'
On purpose, on purpose
It's a trip, trip, trip
Turn the headphones up for me G
Just a little bit lower

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Always had the passion, nigga this a classic
How we came from nothing, went and got established
Livin' like a savage, tryna make some magic
Everybody starving, tryna take the sandwich
I know it's elaborate, a nigga just imagined
Felt the right to ask it, we can make it happen
Weavin' through the traffic, I can take you back then
Everything I said I meant, I was never cappin'
I was never scared to stand, front line with MAC 10's
Raise and shoot at black men, never felt the satisfaction
When I seen the game collapsin', guess they took the rules and wacked it
Started movin' at a different frequency and it got me livin' lavish
All my partners steady passin', tryna wiggle through this madness
Tryna fight this gravity at time and I swear i could feel it pull me backwards
Puttin' thousands on they caskets, tryna pick the right reactions
I appreciate the process, but I'm so conflicted about the status

[Chorus: Buddy]
Almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot where I was goin'
I been driving, I been smokin'
Almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot what I was drinkin'
What the hell have I been thinkin'

[Post-Chorus: Buddy]
Now I'm just ridin' through the city
Now I'm just ridin' through the city
And ain't nobody rollin' with me
And ain't nobody rollin' with me
It ain't a problem, I'm gon get it
It ain't a problem, I'm gon get it
This is a trip, trip, trip, trip
Ridin' 'round smokin' by myself
Don't you know I do it so well
Dollar signs all on my head
Rollin' solo, dolo, this a trip, trip, trip, trip
