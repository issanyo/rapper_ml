[Hook: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Deals, round 'em up
Bills, count 'em up
Need a V12 coupe with a broad that's down as fuck
Met up with this money then fell in love
Playin' this game, stay in your lane
Ain't no traffic when you does
Ain't gon' happen just because
And that's when anything it's gon' take passion, it's gon' take love
But you got actions just don't budge
But I just make this magic with these words
And I take all this cabbage and just splurge

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hu$$le]
All my habits gettin' worse
For instance, all the cars that catch my interest cost at least two hundred thousand
Is it worth it? Tough question
I never consider, I just be flexin'
Some days I drink champagne for breakfast
And what's the point of time, we live blind with a death wish
Came for a circle, now the story is the message
We all want success but most of us is success-less
We all know the game but most of us don't respect it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: GQ]
Before the music, I was dreamin' of sneaker deals
I know they listen when the seats is filled
Still, the night glitter, early morning we chief until
We leaving, printed on it like when tequila spills
Black bottles, lifestyle attract models
A tough act to follow, livin' a black novel
Who the fuck are you? Complimented attitude
Paintin' my city when I'm passing by them avenues
Don't wanna wake up, dream got me up in a coma
Wine bottles and women that age like [Wilona?]
The talk changed, remember face but lost names
I'm still fishin' like card games, cup fizzin'
Reality shots, I'm just drinkin' for confirmation
I got 'em witnessin' my operation
On this, [slickin'?] like Audis get, tropic as Maui trips
Me and my nigga Nipsey on some Cali shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rapper Big Pooh]
I like my 5's on top of 10's, 10's on top of 20's
50's 100's are better, standin' out like a Coogee sweater
Clear sky, sandy beach, women and warm weather
A brainstorm, I hope you brought umbrellas
I'm tired of broke niggas fakin' it
Cause most'll never make it to
Be the caricature of the character they idolizin'
It's like a spreadsheet I'm itemizing
Separatin' the real from what's not
Results are so surprising -- I need Maury
Was in it for the glory
Til I seen [Denzel?] gettin' whipped for that home cookin'
Fell in love when I wasn't lookin'
Write it myself so I'm not mistaken
Bought a Lex with my first big cheque just to show I had the bacon
Money ain't a thing girl, what's shakin'?
My ego probly, I'm in the lobby
Thinking bout this hobby, and how them dream killas tryna rob me
I just wanna be great like Ali, or feared like Tyson
But niggas make it hard when they bitin'
So I pen these letters to enlighten
Fear I'm excitin'
Get in an elevator with a white women, she frightened
As I stand with a smile on my face
She got her hand in her purse ready to introduce mace
While you over there lookin' at me
I'm lookin' at buying a place so count 'em up
