Bitch I makin moves, 6 on 22
Walk inside my house, all you see is glues
Flat screens on the wall, white fence in the hall
Make 100 racks and tell my bitch to count it up
It was against the odds til niggas played they cards
All we did was ball, look how they did my door
All these pretty broads, all these foreign cars
Made a grip to lose it all, it was the rise before the fall
But I still going
H town in my cup, kush still blowin
Strike my nggas up, they know it still rollin
Crenshaw on my shirt, they see they boy blowin

Every time that I go, niggas know that I go off
Pull up in that white Benz, yea baby Ima show off
And all my niggas salute me, like a nigga would stay off
Hitler, you better hide yo bitch cause I'll hit her, I'll hit her

But if a nigga did it she a goner
But man Ima gonna hit a corner
Take a hit of this weed and sippin some of this pour up
Got niggas onto me us yo dream bitch is my main slut
These diamonds heavy on me and yo baby mama she wanna fuck

Tell er it my time and watch the girl get turnt on
Some zig zags and OG, it time to get my burn on

I do it just like Pac, nigga I ain had no shirt on
My money come in lumps, love only come once
You the nigga she got
But I the nigga she want
I told er leave on the pumps
Us it a perfect equation
Her body lookin amazing and my pockets looking Caucasian
And you niggas sloppy on me but Il slap yo face off
Finna buy yo job then you gonna get laid off
Made 35 million then I just gon shade off
By 2015, nigga I be paid off

Purple all in my bitch, money up and just look
Slow paper, all spiff
Get mo paper off kitchen
Got a hublot on my wrist, bad bitch on my dick
Cartiers on my eyes and got my clear side on my grip
It that Dom Cobby and Nip
Ask me, I in here
That west side still the best side, got a mack 11 on hip
I swear that south shit that killed pimp
Same shit that killed Skru
Got these dollars split with my crew
Plus we stay shittin PU
Weak ass, weak jazz
Girl that Cali
That that load, that Kliko, Balenciagas and Balis
This that thrusters and palm trees, my palm raise a profit
Saw that west side and then locked it
Got yo girl heart in my pocket, word
