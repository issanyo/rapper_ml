[REBECCA, spoken]
Hey Josh, I want to look good for you tonight. So I'm gonna get in touch with my feminine side.Â 

(sung)
Uh, it's the sexy getting-ready song
The sexy getting-ready song
I'm primpin' and pluckin'
I'm brushin' and rubbin'
The sexy getting-ready song

First I make
Everything shiny and smooth (Oh, yeah)
Cause I want my body
To be so soft for you (Bye-bye, skin)

I'm gonna make this night
One you'll never forget (Ass blood)
'Cause, boy, I know you like
An hourglass silhouette

(spoken)
Let's see how the guys get ready

(sung)
It's the sexy getting-ready song
The sexy getting-ready song
I'm fluffin' and flouncin'
I'm gigglin' and layin'
Sexy getting-ready song

[NIPSEY HUSSLE]
Hey, look, hop on my dick
With that tight little dress
Then turn that ass around
Like you're trying to impress them

(spoken)
God, what... this is how you get ready? This is some... this is horrifying, like a scary movie or something. Like some nasty-ass patriarchal bullshit.You know what? I gotta go apologize to some bitches. I'm forever changed after what I've just seen

[REBECCA]
It's the sexy getting-ready song
The sexy getting-ready song
It's the sexy getting-ready song
Body rolls are really hard

It's the sexy getting-ready song
The sexy getting-ready song
I'm gonna whisper your dick hard
Whisper your dick hard
The sexy getting-ready song
