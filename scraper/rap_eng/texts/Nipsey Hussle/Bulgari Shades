[Verse 1]
Look, Im like ooh girl whats your name?
I got this cash, I know a place
That we can go and trick off on someone of ten Bulgari Shades
Ive been going hard so long without taking no breaks
Feels so right, I booked two flights, we leave tonight, and get away
Its not about no chase, cause for your pussy I won't pay
But Im inspired and refresh by something beautiful with brains
We both have broken hearts so it's alright to love again
Cause when you let go of your pride, you'll find a lesson in your pain!

[Hook]
Put your guard down, girl, put your guard down!
Put your guard down, girl, put your guard down!
Put your guard down, girl, put your guard down!
Put your guard down . . . . put your guard down!
And thats when, and thats when the guitar come in

Put your guard down
You got to, you know?
Or you can't be mad if youll never feel that feeling again!

And uh, Look, Im like ooh girl whats your name?
I got this cash, I know a place
That we can go and trick off on someone of ten Bulgari Shades
Thats Harrods in London..

[Verse 2]
That made her smile but she said boy, dont even play
I got two jobs, I go to school, I got responsibilities
But I kinda like that type of fly shit that you say
So if you give me yo number, Ill might call you up one day!
And by the way, I know that game you play
With all your money and your fame
But to me it dont mean a thing!
So, just take a seat, dont introduce me to Nipsey
Cause what good is the hood if its no engine underneath!

[Outro]
And that kinda fucked me up, it did!
Thats true!
So I took a seat took off all my jewelry, put my blunt out, took my hat off
And took two shots, of that coconut ciroc
And bring me some of that pineapple juice
