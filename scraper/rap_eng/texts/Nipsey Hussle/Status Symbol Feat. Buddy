[Verse 1 - Nipsey Hu$$le:]
Me I'm getting, back rubs from these leather seats
Negotiating equity positions you'll never be
Rap sheet full of felonies
Status symbol on my set of keys
They say I was selling dreams
Back to the brick wall I'm inhaling trees
Visualizing hella cheese you can smell the weed
Niggas doubt pessimism ain't affecting me
Fuel to the fire took it higher than they ever see
Frequent flight seat like seven seas
Shopping spree spent about 11Gs
Eyes bloodshot I don't ever sleep
My niggas act on instinct we don't ever think
When confronted with a problem we don't ever flee
We connected at the bottom like the letter V
So accustomed to the pop we don't even blink
When them shots go off get the Glock show off
Yellow tape a nigga he grew up to hate a nigga
Nothing major nigga just a demonstration nigga
Within the matrix nigga I drew illustrations with him
Words that is, for sure that is
Look, that nigga got his off the curb, that is
So how the fuck that nigga so concerned with his
I be baffled by the fact when niggas burn their bridge
Then try to double back like, what the fuck is that?
Like, Niggas want this rap life way too bad

[Hook - Buddy:]
We ain't gotta worry no more
We'll be just fine
And we ain't finna wait no more
So don't waste my time
Remember when we had no way, no way
But we'll be ok for now
We'll be ok for now
And here on out

[Verse 2 - Nipsey Hu$$le:]
Now you up huh? make it hard to trust huh?
Got you fucked up saying it was luck huh?
Pulling up huh? limo tinted trucks huh?
Open trust huh? Then you fill em up huh?
Every time a nigga drop it's real as fuck huh?
Every time you hit the road you fill em up huh?
Whole city know that you became the one huh?
They seen it from the jump huh?
The pressure weigh a ton huh?
Especially where you come from
Every night br-br-br-brap bump bump
Heavy price but it's just the cloth you cut from
It's alright it's just life if you want one
Learn to hold yourself down with a big gun
All these niggas playing tough you gon' chip one
For these dollars a decade you a risk one
Fuck it though cause when you flat broke you ain't nothing bro
Seen a gang of rich niggas get comfortable
Then looking at their watch like where the fuck it go
Through my eyes I learnt lessons like
Time is of the essence and my grind got obsessive
Then my mind got restless put myself in the game
But batteries sold separate
Question, since when do real niggas come second?
So I kicked the door down getting more now
Nigga need at least like 30 for the show now
Woah now, realest out of Sou. Cal
Baby wanna fuck I'm like mmm slow down
I'm eating cheese eggs in my hotel
Hustle sold out nigga retailing wholesale
Me ball and hurt your feelings? Oh well
All money in I pull coattails, nigga

[Hook]
