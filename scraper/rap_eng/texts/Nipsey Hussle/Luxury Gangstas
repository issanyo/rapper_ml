[Intro: Young Vedoe & Nipsey Hussle]
Yeah, Strictly Get Dough Records, yeah
All money in, it's top in, California to Cleveland
Corlett to Crenshaw (here we go)
Let's get it my nigga
And this is The 80's (yeah)
Young Vito, Nipsey Hussle (oh me?), huh, huh
Alright, okay


[Verse: Young Vedoe & Nipsey Hussle]
Life, loyalty, luxury, royalty
Happiness, honor, success, principles
It's that simple
Pursuit, from servin' fiends to chasing dreams
We gon' get ours by any means nigga, huh, huh
I found myself, that's when I found wealth
Foot on the gas, gettin' lots of cash
Revvin', yup, block reverend, blaat
Motivation, rap hustlin' and dope sellin'
We movin' weight and gettin' cake, trip takin'
In your state, risk takin', I don't wait
The fam good, they livin' great, at times flake takin'
Tell your BM to give me face, take a nigga bitch taken
Right, vacation
Baby I ain't new to this, first class seats booked
Baby I'm so true to this, goin' places rappers go
I'm smokin' rappers' weed, but you ain't a rapper though
Nope, so what make it special?
Unanswered questions, like is that girl yours?
World tours, I'll take your girl around the world
But you don't rap though?
Nah nigga, please
Big pimpin', get that money off the track holmes (yup)
Still hustle hard but got money to relax though (uh-huh)
Spendin' blue hundreds up at Saks though (cha-ching)
Self made, came in through the back door
And I still pack gats though, better act though
South Central, this the souls of black folks
Cleveland the home of killers and jack boys
Or, where they gangbang and smoke crake mo
And these niggas spendin' money but don't stack though
So they poor, purple Sprite, sip Act more
And these whores bad bitches but they rats though
With you first and then get you out the jack bo

[Outro: Young Vedoe]
Nigga please, you know I do this shit with ease man
Niggas better back the fuck up 'fore you get smacked the fuck up
You know what I'm talkin' about?
And this is The 80's, huh
All money in, Strictly Get Dough Records
Young Vedoe, Nipsey Hussle
Cleveland to Cali, yup
This that smooth shit man, that smooth lade backed shit
That Sade, Smooth Operator type shit
You dig?
Just ride to it man, we on the road to the riches
'Til the wheels fall off
Slim Slater, I see you baby, yeah
