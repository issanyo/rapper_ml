[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Real big, real big, I knew one day I would do it real big
Real shit, real shit, I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time, locs on, can't even see the stars, but we still wish
Real shit, real shit, who would ever thought that we would build this

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Tryna walk to school, get your jaw socked
Tryna pump your gas, get your car shot
Large profit margin on the long shots
'Cause young niggas rarely make it off of our block
Night time, locs on
Fuckin' young bitches while they folks home
High school, didn't go
Couldn't understand my plan, now you niggas know
Self made, well paid
I'm from where they tell you never touch the shell case
I'm from where they teach you never trust a pale face
Let's talk bangin', I can tell you 'bout a field race
Real shit, real shit, I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time, locs on
Fuckin' young bitches while they folks home

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Real big, real big, I knew one day I would do it real big
Real shit, real shit, I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time, locs on, can't even see the stars, but we still wish
Real shit, real shit, who would ever thought that we would build this

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Sold out shows that's a door split
Niggas ain't show up, that's a forfeit
Left my record label, just got more rich
I switched it up, that's me singin' on the chorus
But still I spit bars so gutter
Drive cars, no stutter, top floor, no clutter
Hardwood floors though
White wall, that's where my awards go
Runnin' from the law, 'til they foreclose
Sit wit myself when them doors close
Sometimes I got a question, only Lord knows
When I be going out in Copenhagen, spendin' euros
Night time, locs on
Do it big nigga 'til my Locs home
Real shit, real shit, I know all my real niggas feel this

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Real big, real big, I knew one day I would do it real big
Real shit, real shit, I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time, locs on, can't even see the stars, but we still wish
Real shit, real shit, who would ever thought that we would build this

[Bridge: Marsha Ambrosius]
If I could stay in this moment, I would, forever
If I could live in this moment, said I would, forever
Real shit, real shit
Yeah, yeah
If I could give you the stars baby, I would
Wanna last and share in this moment baby
I'd give you the stars baby, I would

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Real big, real big, I knew one day I would do it real big
Real shit, real shit, I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time, locs on, can't even see the stars, but we still wish
Real shit, real shit, who would ever thought that we would build this
