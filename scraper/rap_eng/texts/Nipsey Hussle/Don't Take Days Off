[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Yea all this stress on my brain right
Poker face, I’m in the game right
Need a week to think, maybe 8 nights. Some promethazine and a str8 flight
Let me cut off my phone, let me get in my zone
Let me center myself just leave a nigga alone
I be back in a few, got some rapping to do. Got some stacking still runnin', got some lapping to do
All, jokes to the side, nigga know that they ain’t fucking with the flow I provide
Y'all, notice how I started now the flow has evolved
And me Ralo Styles like Wade and Lebron
And it’s all money in and your bros is in charge
Hoes will ménage for those rose carte blanche
In them out of town suites cuz they know we the ones
Equity nigga, What I’ve chosen, of course
No 360’s, clothing and tour
When I do drop Ima blow past niggas
And I toe tag niggas like I told ‘em before
Got flow, got whores
Got dough, get more
Fuck mine, get yours
And the show just started, nigga hold your applause
Tryna get to my spot
Look, you gotta go up floors
I put the 6 on stock, I was runnin’ through tires like chicks on tour
And if I’m at the game, you can bet your bottom dollar that I sit on floor
And if I’m at the fight, you can bet your bottom dollar sweat hit my whore

[Hook: Dubb]
Won’t take no loss, won’t take days off
We go so hard, until we fall
Won’t take no loss, won’t take days off
We go so hard, until we fall. A nigga used to dream, my reality a dream now
Nigga used to dream, my reality a dream now
I’m livin' out my dreams now
Livin’ out my dreams now, now, now

[Verse 2: Dubb]
Sitting in the trap like damn tryin' to turn
Couple grams to a couple hundred grand
I grew up in a town they don’t make it out of
If you black you don’t live to see a man
You seen 21, you done won the lottery
Talking friends, well the streets they took a lot from me, I washed up from a robbery
Now your name 4657239B state property
Damn, you had a dream, now you livin’ out a nightmare
You almost made it little nigga, you was right there
Now your release date is in another light-year
Yea, and it’s quite clear
All you needed was a little bit of guidance
In your household it was just silence
You was your own mother and your father. How the hell you supposed to know what to do when nobody showed you the ropes
All they showed you was pistols and dope
Gang flags in the land with no hope where every fitted hat mean a different hood. Make it out and they still want you in the hood your own homies don’t want you livin’ good
Niggas for they self, get it understood
It’s just a playground, full of mood swings die for the color of your shoe strings
Wish I had a different way to view things
You either had a rap book or had a hoop dream
From El Segundo to Slauson
Me and Nip, some young bosses
Never takin’ no losses
Check the garments nigga life’s marvelous
