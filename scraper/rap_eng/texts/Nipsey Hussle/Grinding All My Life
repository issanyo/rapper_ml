[Hook]
All my life, been grindin' all my life
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, I could roll the dice
That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life
All my life, been grindin' all my life
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, I could roll the dice
That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life

[Verse 1]
Look, I'm married to this game, that's who I made my wife
Said I'll die alone, I told that bitch she prolly right
One thing that's for sure, not a stranger to this life
Got a safe that's full of Franklins and a shoulder full of stripes
I don't know a nigga like myself
I say self made, meanin' I designed myself
County jail fades, you can pull my file yourself
Bar raised, swallow rocks, I'm gettin' high myself
Damn right, I like the life I built
I'm from west side, 60, shit, I might got killed
Standin' so tall, they think I might got stilts
Legendary baller, like Mike, like Wilt
'96 Impala thug, life on wheels
Up against the walls, squabble at Fox Hills
Like a motherfuckin' boss, ask me how I feel
Successful street nigga touchin' his first mil

[Hook]
All my life, been grindin' all my life
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, I could roll the dice
That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life
All my life, been grindin' all my life
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, I could roll the dice
That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life

[Verse 2]
Look, I got everythin' I said I was gon' get on my kid
In addition to that fact, I went legit on that shit
Now accordin' to the way that I'm positioned in this biz
It look like I'm just gon' keep on gettin' rich
I know that west side, RSC's is us
LAPD on my dick, I'ma squeeze and bust
If a rap nigga dead, switch cheese and bust
All this rap money, nigga, look I need too much
Money, loyalty and love, in the dream we trust
You be switchin' up the players on your team too much
Tiny copy, that's my loc, yo supreme, what up
And we travel round the world gettin' cream and what
Ain't you get off on whoever hustle, seem to rush
Las Vegas, strip pop, yeah, you creep them punks
After all that lookin' tough, all he see was stumps
50 Cent and Mayweather flee the scene with us, true story

[Hook]
All my life, been grindin' all my life
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, I could roll the dice
That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life
All my life, been grindin' all my life
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, I could roll the dice
That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life
All my life, been grindin' all my life
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, I could roll the dice
That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life
All my life, been grindin' all my life
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, I could roll the dice
That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life
All my life, been grindin' all my life
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, I could roll the dice
That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life
All my life, been grindin' all my life
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, I could roll the dice
That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life
