(Verse 1)
What’s ya life like?
F-F-Fuckin awesome!
Everyday I be wakin up like
Woop! woop!
Let’s get it poppin!
A bad day just ain't a option
They standin still I’m probably moshin
Live my own way with no caution, so at 10 am
We bar hoppin
It’s like that
Sometimes this shit really is rediculous
Should be out there somewhere readin palms
Cause somehow I predicted this
Take a trip with us, we’ll hop on a plane
At the first sight of any rain
Touchdown in the Tropix
Empty all the pockets
Pop champagne
And not worry bout a daaaammmmn thang
Yeah, we keep it extra chill
Have the time of your life?
I-I-I bet you will
But it get better still
This just another day for us
Don’t stop til ya get enough
So we chilled out never in a rush

Now everybody wanna get blazed with MOD
I lift them up they be like “oh my god”
Some make it seem so hard, well let me demonstrate…
WHAT’S YA LIFE LIKE? MINE’S GREAT!

(Chorus)
What’s ya life like?(x4)
Mine’s great.(x2)

(Nipsey Hu$$le)

On some hip hop, hippy hop type shit. You feel me?

What’s ya life like? Mine’s great
I done made it out despite my city’s crime-rate
Every single room, that’s what I break
Hit me like an oma, seize the moment hu$$le, why wait?
One thing I never do is excercise hate, but I’m the illest doin it in my state
Probably my country, probably this world
Anywhere I see myself I bet I get there
If there’s a throne to sit on, I bet I sit there
If there’s a crown to be worn, I bet it fit yeah
Call me “Young Nip-Sino”
These Niggas pussy, 3 squares like cee-lo
Blood-suckin people like man made mosquitoes
Once a month I still gotta see my P.O
Had so many cars, but I ain't never seen a repo
Leather seat flow sippin mile-high mojito’s
