[Intro]
Check me out, look

[Verse]
I know perfect timing feels like I'm too late
And I know I'm still great in spite of my mistakes
You know it's authentic, every rhyme I say
My only regret is I made niggas wait
See, ain't too many like us, we like vintage Bape
And I don't fuck with busters, I can't integrate
Grew up with these killers in my living space
Lotta niggas folded through them village days
Citywide, gang and junction police raids
L.A. Times, Rollin 60s, made the front page
I vowed to never let you ditch and seal my fate
Sellin' dope with hopes to graduate to real estate
I knew I was drummin' to a different beat
Felt it in my stomach, I was just unique
We decided we gon' let these digits speak
Then we turn Slauson into Venice Beach
S 600 Maybach, platinum dealer plates
Wake up in this penthouse to the cityscape
You know it's authentic, every shit I say
I knew self destruction ain't the only way
Sometimes perfect timing feels like I'm too late
But  I know you still great in spite of your mistakes
Before you run your race you gotta find a pace
Just make sure you cross the line, and fuck the time it takes
I got out the county jail 2008
Couple months, I dropped the tape then I was on my way
My first single out, it set the streets ablaze
On location, shot that video in front the cage
Tryna find my way through this fuckin' maze
Every concert, hundred niggas on the stage
I'm still active so it's really just another day
Promoters paranoid to book you, that affects ya pay
And when you stop eatin', that affects your weight
And when you get hungry, that affects your brain
See me I'm not trippin', I respect the game
I hope y'all do, if I can't make it, I'm gon' take your chain
See ain't too many like us, we like vintage Bape
And I don't fuck with busters I can't integrate
I know perfect timing feels like I'm too late
But every single time I drop they tell me I'm the great
