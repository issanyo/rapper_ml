[Chorus]
Oh baby it's been soo long, oohh
Oh baby it's been soo long, oohh

[Verse 1]
Mogul and they know that, logo on my floor mat
Courtside Chamberlain throwback match my Rolex
Everywhere I go, flex, vallet park on some loc shit
Whole lot of smoke in that 'Rari, that thing potent
Burnin' rubber, wearin' cameras, they was undercovers
Under pressure, made statements, turned on they brothers
Never judge you, but the streets will never love you
I wonder what it come to you in your brain for you to run to
Ones that hate us, hand cuff us and mace us
Call us dumb niggas 'cause our culture is contagious
Third generation, South Central gang bangers
That lived long enough to see it changing
Think it's time we make arrangements
Finally wiggle out they mazes, find me out in different places
“I’m the spook by the door”, this the infiltration, double back, dressed in blue laces

[Chorus]
Oh baby it's been soo long, oohh
Oh baby it's been soo long, oohh

[Verse 2]
They killed Dr. Sebi, he was teachin' health
I fuck with Rick Ross 'cause he teachin' wealth
Dropped out of school, I'ma teach myself
Made my first mil' on my own, I don't need your help
All black Tom Ford, it's a special evenin'
City council meetin', they got Hussle speakin'
Billion dollar project bout to crack the cement
So one of our investments had become strategic
Summer roll '18, man it's such a season
'Bout to make more partners look like fuckin' geniuses
We was in the Regal, it was me and Steven
We done took a dream and turned it to a zenith
Anything I want and everything I needed
Gotta pace yourself, it's all about yo' breathin'
You can have it all, it's all about your reason
I done took my name and carved it in the cement

[Chorus]
Oh baby it's been soo long, oohh
Oh baby it's been soo long, oohh

[Verse 3]
I flashback on that shootout at the beach, twenty deep
You tried to squeeze, your gun jammed and they released
Blood on your tee, how many stains? I see three
The bitch started to panic so I made her switch seats
Drivin' now, police chopper ahead flyin' now
Really not too spooked, calmly asked me, "Am I dyin' now?"
All I know is keep you calm and collected
Crackin' jokes like, "Nigga, now you gon' be finally respected"
See your blood leakin', got my foot on this gas
Tossed the .40, we pull up to Daniel free and see CRASH
You know the alibi, they started shootin', we was standin' by
Ain't see nothing, but the flare from the talons fly
"I wasn't there, I was passin' by"
Matter fact, don't say shit, I'm just gon' drop you in the back and slide
That's yo weed, all the cash is mine
I take 'em both to the spot plus your phone til you back online

[Chorus]
Oh baby it's been soo long, oohh
Oh baby it's been soo long, oohh
