Pistols poppin
Shells fly you see the bodies drop
I'm knee deep in these streets you niggas dip dobbin
Too many niggas tryna hustle
Just stick to robbin
Imagine grindin 12 hours with 200 dollars
Block boy
It's my rise to the top boy
10 speed handle bar before I did the drop boy
I rock a soldier rag but nuttin like the hot boys
Mine navy blue "S" dome with the top toy
Yea and I walk it like I talk it boy
You don't wanna sqauble you socks like the tp droor
White Lincoln with the light grey leather seats
Chrome alpinas on perellies sold seperately
Hell yea I'm rich rollin with the weponry in case I got to pop a fuck nigga like a exstacy
So a worry on my mind is what you'll never be
I'm ready for what ever beef
You niggas ain't no threat cause I'm

Strapped
But you don't want no problems with my sqaud
Come through yo block niggas poppin out the cars
We
Clap
And I don't care who you are
Nigga fuck yo hood nigga fuck yo hood

These niggas is bitches they whisper they business to women
And wonder how the cops catch em and bitches is snitchin
Brag about a bank lick and a couple of killins
Now he done talked hisself right into a life sentence
Damn

Just a message for you stupid crips and stupid bloods
Look I'm not as stupid as ya'll thought I was come through yo block and let ya'll talk about who cocked the slug
Sick shit
Roughless scandless crip shit
Slauson nigga I bet you get banged on
That's what my nigga shady blue got the gage for
That's what my nigga black sam got the mack for
Feds frontin my spot I'm runnin out the back door
But it's a rap cause they had me surrounded
Took me to the ground
Then they took me downtown
Cause I was

Now when you come to my hood you better watch yo back
And when I come to yo hood you know I got that mack
Cause I'm strapped
And you don't want no problems with my sqaud
Naw you don't want no problems with my sqaud

Yo boy turn a B 12 base rocks to benjamens
One way ticket to the nyc
Told my P.O. my auntie died I got to visit my peeps
But um
Look you know that's not the case right
I'm splittin doutches on a stoop with a A flight
Yea

So holla at me cause I got it if you need dope
West side niggas so you know we got the cheap quotes
He so off comma 6 0 comma "S" I'm a threat to an amigo
