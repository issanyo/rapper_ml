Hussle is my last
Hussle is my last name
Look I'm a stay fresh
Y'all stay bummy
Y'all can chase pussy
I'm a chase money
You only live once and niggas die young
You live by the bullet you're gonna die by the gun
I'm coming off Slauson where niggas hate your guts
And... be riding high, niggas wanna set you up
They probably jealous of it never get enough
They say money ain't the root of all evil, nigga say whaaat?
Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
I've been on the grind since the age of fourteen
Started with a quota, bought my first buck
Bought my first gun, said f*ck it then I bust
It ain't the ones I f*cked off it's the ones I f*cked with
Ain't the ones I trap trade, it's the ones I trusted
Jealousy and envy see it all around me
Looking for nip hussle on the block is where they found me
I'm like ooooh, get ready
I got my mind on a whole 'nother setting
When they see me they say Nip where ya heading
And I be like on my way to the cheddar
Look look look
Slauson boy swag
Check out my demeanor
Gold cuban links, bullet proof beemers
Duffle bag money I ain't never had a visa
And if sports was hip hop I be balling all season
Cops can't stop us
Rolex watches, homes foreclose when the popo's caught us
County jail state pen time is nothing
Bounce back and now I'm about to take raps top honors
Cause
I'm on the block with these rocks
Posted loked, lowkey so Johnny think I'm smoking
Focused on nothing more than getting to my quota
Hoping the block well before they start patrolling
I'm knowing, they watching us binoculars is scoping
Bumping up the smokers trying ask me where I sold it
My mind state money over everything underneath the sun, and death out the barrel of my gun, go bang
Don't ask me why I gang bang
It's easy, believe me, the coppers they need me
I pay they salary, they know my calories with weight
Too heavy to stop, I'm chopping down ounces, halfs
Sevens, boulders, dimes, nicks, watever
I'm going forever I'm never gon stop it
So don't holla at me unless money is the topic
