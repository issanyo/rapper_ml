Intro/Chorus (Nipsey) x2:
Don't worry 'bout what people gon' say girl do what you want to
The liquor got you open and yeah that shit got me on too
But we just havin' fun, we just havin' fun, we just havin' fun, we just havin' fun

Verse 1 (Nipsey):
As I travel across the world on these first class flights
I miss home, but I get those for my hard time but my gas right
But that's life, sacrifice, you chasin' dreams that's the price
These red carpets and bright lights and black surburbans and late nights
Ain't new to me, standin' on the couch with my wife beater on and my jewelry
I was young visualizin' what I grew to be, then it all turned out so
Beautifully and
Night times is usually a colorful sky and a quarter of weed, a bottle of ciroc and a couple of freaks
And then they drop it like it's hot 400 degress, wait, get with it
My hotel's killin' and my windows stretch from the floor to the ceilin'
My coupe, topless, the view, I promise, we fuck off a couple thousand, shoe shoppin'
My swag, Slauson, I laugh, often, remember when I told you I would have all
This?
Diamonds, flawless, we live, lawless, just fuck with me on some boss shit

Chorus (Nipsey) x2:
Don't worry 'bout what people gon' say girl do what you want to
The liquor got you open and yeah that shit got me on too
But we just havin' fun, we just havin' fun, we just havin' fun, we just havin' fun
