[Verse 1]
Dickie shorts, Bally belt, boxer briefs
Bitch of course this marathon is where you ought to be
Shopping sprees spending thousands on designer jeans
Exotic women Mercedes Benzes with bucket seats
Pretty feet, pretty hair that blow in the breeze
It's pretty rare that she meet a nigga as real as me
Especially when she fishing in this music industry
But luckily she fucked around and fucked with me
Surround myself with the finer things
I guess I'm Hollywood cuz I'm enjoying what my grinding bring
I'm All Money In, dot I-N-C
Minus the major record label time to rise to feet
On every stage I'm giving everything inside of me
But she gon' give it back after the show in the [?] suite
My nigga Rimpee's got a big freak
Down the bottle get cracking over this beat
We smoking good, y'all smell the weed
We finally made it to the plane then we fell asleep
The morning came, the night leave
A little of a work a holic shit I might be
Up at 6 in the morning like I'm Ice T
Spent a grip on the Malcolm X, Spike Lee
Them other rappers never think they like me
On any given day 60 thousand on my white tee
Ain't nothing much but what them dollars bring
Addicted to the rush of money wires and depositing
So no I can't fall asleep at the driver's seat
That's why I wake up to a kush blunt and a Ralo beat
Hard top push the button yo turn the key
Bullet proof cuz I know niggas wanna murder me
I never heard of you
I know you heard of me
And that's the part that make your head hurt

[Outro]
It's 5 in the morning
And I'm talking this thug shit to you
Got it and I want it
Let me run this marathon with you
Cuz I got it on deck baby
I put that on the set baby
I'm kissing on yo neck
Yo pussy get wet
And then we have sex baby
Cuz I got it on deck baby
I put that on the set baby
I get to kissing yo neck
Yo pussy get wet
And then we have sex baby
Ayee
You know the hotel get turnt up if we in it
Smell the kush soon as
You exit the elevators
You hear the music
