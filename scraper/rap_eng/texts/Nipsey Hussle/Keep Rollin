CUZZY Capone:
I cherish life cause we living in the last days
Haters thought i wouldn't make it from my past ways
Money was the motive I was speeding in the fast lane
Up early mornings at the door when the cash came
Grinding i was enthused by the fast change,dope brains i ain't say nothing when the crash came
Addicted, to the fly clothes and sun shades
Restricted,to them blocks where the guns bangs
They tried to put niggas on pause but they couldn't stop it
Cause we was different from the rest we was uncommon
We was wild living free but we had the knowledge
We used to be up all night just to make the profit
Nowadays shit is different niggas ain't the same
I smile even when it hurts cause I hate the pain
I see the fake in niggas eyes but I can't complain
If I could do it all over I do it again

Nipsey Hu$$le:
Is it on your mind? Is it what you love? Is it worth your time?
Did you wait too long? Did the window close and it pass you by?
Is it all you got? If it all fall down would it break your heart?
When you leave its hurtful,when you in that dirt and you make your mark
Did you put your all in it? Did you reach your goal? Did it come with problems?
Did you start on Slauson? Did you make your way? Was it so exhausting?
Wasn't it so obvious? Celebrate your wins can't take your losses
Wasn't raised by bosses keep rolling problems that's how we solve them
Was you out here hustling? Cause your pops was gone and your moms was struggling?
Don't complain about nothing, cause you know they tried and they both put love in
Did you go off subject? Did the pain from your past make it hard to love shit?
Then you look forward but you couldn't find, then it turn to self-destruction
Then it cut deep, but you must see that in life that it ain't no justice
But it's about what you make it,then you make it and it ain't about nothing
No it ain't about nothing and it ain't about Slauson and it ain't about stunting
But I do it to shit on you niggas assumptions
