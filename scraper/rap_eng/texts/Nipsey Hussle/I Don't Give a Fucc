[Hook]
I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, and my beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your town
I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, and my beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your town

[Verse 1]
My mama wanna know why I'm banging
She told me I'ma lose my life
I ain't trippin I'm a crip and ima do it right
'Fore I run from a nigga I lose the fight
I gotta hustle, momma ima move the white
If I died came back I'd do it twice
Brain washed by the block it consumed my life
Cool nigga but a killa when the mood is right
Bullets have the dogs howling at the moon at night
Momma its cold outside
Ain't no hope outside
Couple niggas getting money most us broke outside
Rocks in the house selling dope outside
Reminiscing on my niggas that got smoked outside
Suckas in the house when them locs outside
Huslta gotta eat when them folks outside
Got a burner in my lap and I'm dippin in my bucket
Lifes a bitch nigga fuck it!

[Hook]
I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, and my beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your town
I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, and my beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your town

[Verse 2]
They say we probably die sanging, banging, pressing the line
All a nigga really got is my respect and my pride
Got a Chopper for the coppers keep protecting the ride
Every nigga got a limit never step on the line
When the set say it's on I'm expecting to ride
When the world say I'm on I got the set on my side
Matter fact a nigga got the set on my back
Slauson boy, the world ain't ready for that
Nigga it's cold in my hood
Ain't no hope in my hood
Couple homies couldn't cope smoking dope in my hood
But I could never ever be from no other hood
And I could never ever leave my folks in the hood
Thank the Lord every morning that I woke in the hood
And summers that I wrote prome spokes in the hood
If I never sold a mil off what I wrote in my hood
I ain't trippin cause niggas know I spoke for my hood

[Hook]
I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your tow I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your town
