[Verse 1]
Late night niggas at the Shell deep
Bird out, gang signs, to the pale beast
Big guns, long clips and they well grease
Black woman on my 20 dollar bill crease
Head shot, man down in the ville, sheesh
Enemies, M.C.'s will get swiss cheesed
Double back, 10 minutes made a big scene
Bullets start flying by a nigga, that's a sick breeze
While I'm here, take a pic please
You know legends die young, rest in peace Prince and Pimp C
From the block to the big leagues self-made millionaire, white America ain't pimp me
Don't tell me that it's skin deep
Don't tell me that I'm tripping only listening to my instincts
Step back for the increase
Hussle ain't got it mapped out dough the feeling

[Verse 2]
Late night niggas, on 109th deep
Choppers out 'case a nigga tryna come creep
Bitch tripping cause I'm always in the streets
Bag of money in the Beemer on the back seat
Bitch you getting played or you playing
Broke ass niggas always running round hating see a unknown face where you from?
Is you banging, heard your name before
You that nigga making statements
So Way Out got gang of niggas in the cut pointing red dots
Lil skinny ass nigga calling all shots
They said the snitches tryna get a nigga knocked off
Fuck all cops, to a million dollar spot when I slide off
Chuck the deuce in the G when I ride off
All luxury shit for a young boss
