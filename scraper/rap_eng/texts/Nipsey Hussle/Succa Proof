[Chorus]
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm succa proof
Don't play no games, boy I'm busta proof
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm succa proof
Don't play no games, boy I'm busta proof
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm succa proof
Don't play no games, boy I'm busta proof
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm succa proof
Don't play no games, boy I'm busta proof

[Verse 1]
Look, I don't give a fuck what you niggas done
I don't give a fuck where you niggas from
'Fore you and your mouth, go and get a gun
Leave you slumped on the scene, that's a hit and run
Oh, ya'll bloods now, oh, ya'll crips now
Fuck it, I'm big drawers, I'm J. Prince now
I frontline wars we can't fix now
Bought latex gloves, that's no prints now
If you broke bread, you got chip now
Couple things you can't buy inside this town
Loyalty, love, and respect
And niggas will extort you out your check

[Chorus]
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm succa proof
Don't play no games, boy I'm busta proof
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm succa proof
Don't play no games, boy I'm busta proof
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm succa proof
Don't play no games, boy I'm busta proof
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm succa proof
Don't play no games, boy I'm busta proof

[Verse 2]
Look, I don't give a fuck how you niggas feel
I could tell a fake, I could tell a real
Got a purple heart out the battlefield
Now watch me levitate to a hunnid mill
Fuck a pound, nigga, fuck a pill
I negotiate a better deal
Fuck around, nigga, yes I will
Take a life 'fore I take a L
Time to even out the playin' field
These niggas wasn't playin' fair
I'm solo and still made it here
Rich real nigga, ask yo' bitch how that make her feel
Bang

[Bridge: Konshens & J. Black]
Original badmon
Touch rude until proper thousand
These streets in mi our own
And no love for Jah mon
The streets man'll send ya home
It get hotter than a toaster
Yuh violate Rvssian and Kosa
Boy this Nipsey Hussle
Exercise mi trigger finger muscle
Gangbang, money, bling this shit so dangerous
You know the lifestyle dangerous
Oh yeah, those colors so dangerous (lawd)
Money, the fame, and the power this shit so dangerous
I'm with these bitches so dangerous
You know the streets so dangerous (lawd)

[Chorus]
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm succa proof
Don't play no games, boy I'm busta proof
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm succa proof
Don't play no games, boy I'm busta proof
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm succa proof
Don't play no games, boy I'm busta proof
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm succa proof
Don't play no games, boy I'm busta proof
