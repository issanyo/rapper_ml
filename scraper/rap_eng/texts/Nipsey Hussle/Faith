[Verse 1]
I'm rising in this game and it feels great
Still tryna keep it real, niggas still fake
Been off the label all year, nigga still ate
Drop the marathon in December, niggas still late

I'm so impatient, but I still wait
I still show love when I feel hate
On a scale of one to ten, I need a high heel eight
Or better, blowin' this cheddar like I'm Bill Gates
Whatever
I'm in this wind til the movie ends
Smokin' California, eatin Peruvian
Out on Miami beach my niggas a few of 'em
Dressed like Beverley Hills, the bitches we usually with

But wishin on a star nigga took it far
And if I lost it all tomorrow I wouldn't trip at all
They say I'm crazy when I say it
But the fear of fallin off is the only thing that can take your faith

[Verse 2: F. Mills]
The boy Millie a breath of fresh air
Breezing through these haters man
How the hell did he get here
Got niggas taking hiatus man
About to send it up
I been done with these fake hoes
You can spot the bs
They never gon be faithful
Cruising through the city
Bout as smooth as shit I'm diddy
I'm soothing her show her titties
I'm choosing to take the city
I'm as witty as they come
She pretty I make her cum
Now she leaving I just begun
It's a fever I'm running one
I retrieve em I run and gun
No deceiving we having fun
I'm a see if they heard of em
Trek gang here they come
Been the leader of this shit
We all one fuck a split
Im fond of her now she wondering who this son of a bitch
I'm a confident mufucka
On the road and im getting rich
Far from tacky they say im arrogant
Hoes stay on my dick
Spit the facts and so nigga actually
0s Is all I get
Ain't no passin me so quit gassing me
Folding the competi.. tion
Move
Midwest to West coast
Whatup Nip
Charles good lookin'
Hustle
Trek Gang
