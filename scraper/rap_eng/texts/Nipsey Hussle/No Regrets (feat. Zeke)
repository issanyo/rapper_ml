Let's go on some new shit
I say this I is necessary rap
Fuck this track and get your shit splat
For you ever heard me rap I had to spit crack
Slimey rocks, Crashed off they find me shot
Or doing numbers like Def Jam in the 90s ?
Much to they surprise Im the fuckin flyest
In the Chevy playing Pac 'nigga still I rise
Blue rag around my forehead, code red
Slauson Ave infiltrate rap to take mo' bread
Quote it how you want I just roll the blunt
Sipping lean in first class gettin my shoulders rubbed
Streets talkin so I'm listenin with a loaded gun
Still all I hear nigga sayin I'm the chosen one
Champagne open 'watch it over one
I hear 'em 'serving '
It's still a justice '
I've been getting money but it's different when you're famous
All this nigga famous but it's different when you banging
All this niggas '. Al this... Try to hating
What will you do... Decision '
First I have to count try to go'
Get over grass my nigga'double bang'
Always stay label, no famous, no '
And rap about al it's just a life
Pull up in 'like Jamaican '
'
Now the bro call and I never made '
New awful speculation 'probably hate this movie before
Fuck 'em
... Just words nigga ain't mean nothing
All we have now, got it on my chest now
'Mama know that I was special
It's probably rock... We never though like '
Heart of a lion, all it's inside me it's worth for that trying
... Cuz I'm from the hood and '
Success I just wanna fair in life
'i ain't try to '
Still proud when I look at the mirror'
'Bake on the '
I'm zipping hot team now'
'Forever I'm the '
'i past on my 'them I macked out some more
'
Respect how I mask all my role
And I made it all and all alone
All we have now, got it on my chest now
'Mama know that I was special
It's probably rock... We never though like '
Heart of a lion, all it's inside me it's worth for that trying
... Cuz I'm from the hood and 'scared about dyeing
