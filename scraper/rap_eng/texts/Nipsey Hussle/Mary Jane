[Pre-Chorus: Sam Sneak]
I got my mind right with this shit
I'm so fucked up 'bout this
Got me out of my feelings
What I love is my business
What I love is my business
What is the backwood?
Khalifa papers, thug down swisher sweets
Come on, smoke one with me

[Chorus]
Mary Mary Jane, Mary Mary Jane, Mary Mary Jane
I love you, I love you
Mary Mary Jane, Mary Mary Jane, Mary Mary Jane
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Yeah, gotta roll it back before I write a verse
Gotta do it big before I'm in a hearse
Gotta milk the game, everything it's worth
Gotta know it could be better and it could be worse
What I do with all the pressure when I'm finna burst?
Reconnected to the essence of the universe
I roll flights and roll dice my whole life
I know raised, gun fights and cold nights
Spot livin', dirty pistol, no lights
Tryna shift my level up from the low life
Tryna get these devils out of my soul right
But for now these pebbles is all I own, right?
Look, I took chances you never took
I bossed up and wrote the book
Don't look back, i never look
Won't look back, I never look
I'm a golden child, I know my style
Unique, I'm a one of one, evolved from out the streets
I'm a perfect flaw when focused on the beats
Ain't no stoppin' me, the fuck you niggas think
I done made my lane and pushed me to my brink
I ain't make the game, I play this like the streets
Need a fresh wash a pack a backs
A sack of green to roll the dough in

[Chorus: Sam Sneak]
I got Mary Jane, Mary Mary Jane, Mary Mary Jane
I love you, I love you
Mary Mary Jane, Mary Mary Jane, Mary Mary Jane
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
South beach smokin' out
With a lot of women, yeah it's goin' down
Any time I blow, know it's by the pound
I done got a cleaning lady in my house
Champagne by the fountain
So much money, I can't count it
Remember days that they doubted
Real niggas, they around me
When you walk in my garage, you get lost
Where? where? where? where? where?
Still a young nigga but I been a boss
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Same ones that I came up with
Same ones on a plane right hand
Same ones blowin' smoke in the air
Same ones that was hatin' on us
Same ones that'll never make enough
Same one, I'll never change up
Ink under my shirt, smoke all in my lungs
Kush come from the earth, hit my line, you want some

[Chorus: Sam Sneak]
I got Mary Jane, Mary Mary Jane, Mary Mary Jane
I love you, I love you
Mary Mary Jane, Mary Mary Jane, Mary Mary Jane
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Can't do it without you, so glad to have found you
No cater to crown, I got 'bout seven pounds
So now I sit down and twist up, baseball bat causin' stuff
[?] smoked out in the cut, bombed out in the Cutlass
Always mobbin' with a boss bitch
This gas will have you coughin', you can start the car with it, might fuel the stars with it
If I had one wish, the world would be high off this
Stay comin' up with that player shit
Every day wake up, make more chips
My nigga we forever rich, hundred dollar roach clips
Suckers can't afford this, real G's have rewarded this
Light one, get aboard the mothership, don't get left
You'll be sober all by yourself
Now we countin' money on jets, remember stay high, stay fresh
Disappear from the set in a Corvette
Your broad ain't came back yet, you wild upset
Crackin' another, need destress
While your dog bitch in her, blowin' on killer
Nothin' but some real ones in the building
Nigga gettin' higher than the ceiling, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Sneak]
I got my mind right with this shit
I'm so fucked up 'bout this
Got me out of my feelings
What I love is my business
What I love is my business
What is the backwood?
Khalifa papers, thug down swisher sweets
Come on, smoke one with me

[Chorus]
Mary Mary Jane, Mary Mary Jane, Mary Mary Jane
I love you, I love you
Mary Mary Jane, Mary Mary Jane, Mary Mary Jane
I love you, I love you, I love you
