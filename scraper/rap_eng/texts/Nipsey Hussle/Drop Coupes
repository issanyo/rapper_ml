(Intro)
Niggas be nervous on the mic
I’m real confortable
Look

(Verse)
Count my dough and smoke up
I’m from California
Mean my weed is potent, all my bitches go up
Where you from? So what?
Ah yall niggas so tough?
All you niggas so broke
All my niggas so up
California sown up, and I’m still a owner
And I’m on my shit, smellin my aroma
Fuck you niggas, watch this
Rollie with no toc tic
Oops, I mean no tic tc
Never took no pit stop
Every time my shit drop
Victory for hip-hop
Never mind my title, I’m the up and coming Michael
All I got is ice on, skinny as a rifle
Still my pockets fat nigga, bitches need some lipos

(Hook)
Pull up in drop coupes
Hopped in them V12’s
Went from that mixtapes, shutdown retail
Switchin my line nigga, she hittin my Twitter fool
Niggas is sprung on pussy
Me, I’m just payin dues

(Verse)
Built my foundation strong, now I live like a boss
Even good niggas hate you but fuck you I kill you all
Sippin that lean, huh?
But niggas not trill at all
Niggas is playin with me
Like sushi ain’t really raw
Like guns don’t really kill
And bullets ain’t really hot
Like I ain't a fuckin fool
2000 and 20 Pac
He said hit em up
X said shut em down
I been going hard, ain’t no stopping now

(Hook)
Pull up in drop coupes
Hopped in them V12’s
Went from that mixtapes, shutdown retail
Switchin my line nigga, she hittin my Twitter fool
Niggas is sprung on pussy
Me, I’m just payin dues

(Verse)
I can’t see the ceiling, ya'll can’t see the reason
I keep killin niggas, but I can’t leave em breathin
Bro said do it to em
I’m gon do it to em
See these brick walls?
I keep on going through em
They can't stop it nigga, this my profit nigga
It’s my real sweat
Yall ain’t killed shit
But if you a real nigga
Had to do real shit
Come from a real struggle
Hustle and deal shit
Promise you feel this
Know that you fearless
All of my real bloods
All of my real crips
Doing her thang for you
Shout out that real bitch
Hop on them planes nigga
Taking them field trips

(Hook)
Pull up in drop coupes
Hopped in them V12’s
Went from that mixtapes, shutdown retail
Switchin my line nigga, she hittin my Twitter fool
Niggas is sprung on pussy
Me, I’m just payin dues

(Bridge)
Ain’t no excuse for my failures
My success, no apologies
All that I own
Absolute honesty
Keep it 100
But that’s what they all say

(Hook)
Pull up in drop coupes
Hopped in them V12’s
Went from that mixtapes, shutdown retail
Switchin my line nigga, she hittin my Twitter fool
Niggas is sprung on pussy
Me, I’m just payin dues
