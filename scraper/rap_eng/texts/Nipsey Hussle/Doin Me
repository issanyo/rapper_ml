[Hook]
What the fuck is the truth like?
I don't believe in half the gossip these niggas talking
You ask me, this some female shit, I'm just doing me
Nigga fuck you worry about what I been doing
Instead of hating, learn to keep it a G
I've been doing me
It's all good homie
It's all good baby
Uhh

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Niggas lifting like what the fuck I expected
Caught up they feelings cause they feeling neglected
Since when this shit was cooling shit
But I guess these little niggas stuck in a wave of jealousy
I pray to God I don't get infected solid I'm blessed to be
How the fuck you count another nigga's pockets hating on em
Either cause he shining that woman you loved to bathe on em
Posted up talkin in the hood
Though shoulda been in the field
Right inside of my zone you get blitzed while I receive a ill
The thought of posse is perfect timing the MV promise
Probably cause my hustle be punishing niggas being honest
I guess this my fault cause I win I got what I needed nigga
I know its snakes that's why this your mind is weeded nigga
Everyone wanted these shoes, I hate to say they made to fit
Nothin but a nigga known as King, fuck the bullshit
Follow my lead I might just help you in your last days
And show you how the real niggas do it minus your fucked up plays

Soon as you blow up
Niggas wanna show up

Said a word get em killed
And all of our mouths sealed, Yeah
Fuck a closed door bitch I got the master key
Niggas talk bout blastin me
I think the devil's after me
Shit was lookin bad for me
Though she was a crackhead
I thank my mom for havin me
Only they told me
Get up off your ass, B
Got up off my ass
Turn the ounces to a half a pea

And show off they true colors, fuck em
Damn, I ain't even tripping

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Look I relate too much
Hope you make it just don't make too much
Kept it real these niggas fake as fuck
And its gonna change you up
Gave you game and yeah it made you tough
Too tricky though so stay for what?
I used to take the bus
Get too loose I had to tape you up
But I was grindin and savin up
I did my take around for a somethin wit amazing thrust
I pressed the gas in my favrite chucks
Shout it this kush that I'm blazin up
And the fact I ate stake  for lunch
I wish my biggest haters know my cake is up
Kill my worst enemies wit my favrite gun
Yeah, and that's the vision
Makin no apologies for how I'm livin
Look I had to get it
Give a fuck how niggas feel that's not my business
