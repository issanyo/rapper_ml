Uh
Uh huh, uh huh
Look (Drake)
I let the beat bang
I dont claim colors
Honestly to honesty is why the game love us
My women either center folds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard i make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winter
But when its winter time
Im still waitin on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the amophi coast
Couple days on the beach
Then its adios
(killlla)
Just look at what i done alone
Your would swear we planted trees the way the moneys grown
We been busy like some bees no honeycomb
And you can probably feel the breeze when the moneys blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
I never be the reason that a bitch got paid
Even when im not functioning in tip top shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs

(listen) (Nipsey Hussle)
Before rap
My last name was my lifestyle
And when i visualize success
It look like right now
What was once gray skies
Is now white clouds
And i did it with the ones ya said was not the right crowd
Follow my steps
And you see what im bout
I keep my money comin in
And never goin out
From chuck taylors on the pavement with the blammers out
Then i hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
And now my face bring the cameras out
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
You know the one the cops bunk you up and ask about
All because i took my wildest dreams and then mapped em out
I go for mine like its overtime
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over shine
Been fuck bitches
I been on my grind
Cuz on a mission your worst enemy is idle time
