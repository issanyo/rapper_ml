Hook: 2x

That's how i knew, That's how i knew
That's how i knew, That's how i knew
That's how i knew, That's how i knew
That's how i knew, That's how i knew i was different

I seen it..I thought it, I dreamed it
I said it..I did it, I meant it
I taste it..I love it, I need it
I want it..More of it, I fiend it
I'm  Godly..I'm gutta, I'm genius
I'm proud of cheese grits at fo seasons
Fresh squeezed, no stressants, no reason toast champagne to achievements
I think we should dive off the deep end, take you on vacation every weekend
Look, i be up at 6, niggas sleep in
I be at the Ritz puffin G Pens
Them other niggas soft, i'm the cement
14 Bonnie and Clyde, we can be them
These rich nigga rules i believe in, manifested, they be blessings and thats how i know

Hook 2x

That's how i knew that i was different though
Run fast, this a different flow
Different deals gettin different dough
Yea, my life... doin different shows, catch a flight, do my shit, hit a lick and go
Oh, Now i got a different goal cuz i reached all my old ones
I be feelin like somebody reached out and chose us
I be killin life, nigga we got it rollin, we pop and po shit
Standin on them couches with my whole clique
Our jewelry on some 1994 shit
Champagne flutes, watch em go "click", afterwards baby fucked the whole clique
West Coast shit..on the master to these classics, Death Row shit
So when that check come, I get mo chips
All money in, I went and got my own shit nigga

Nipsey Talking

Life, and its like you know, you can look a gift horse in the face and not know what you looking at. I feel like you know, I'm looking at the gift horse, i'm just one of the ones who know what I'm looking at. You know what I mean, it's actually an incredible time, it's like a gold rush, It's never been a time like this. In our generation, its our equivalent of a gold rush, with everybody moving to California, this technology has empowered everybody and its as big as you wanna make it, and will go as far as you take it. And we can quote a gang of things going on in the world right now, or just accept it as being ??..Like man, giants gone crumble, new companies gone crumble and pop up outta nowhere and its gone be dramatic. I believe that
