[Nipsey Hussle]
I got everything, nigga
Got young niggas that's gonna shoot for me
Bad bitches that buy shoes for me
Versace this, I'm the shit, got the six, got yo bitch
I ain't cocky I'm confident
So I don't really need no compliments
Million dollar deals that's common sense
I might let a major label be a part of this
I had one shot went hard for this
Went to wars got scars for this
Shootouts in all of my Slauson tip
So shoutout to all of my accomplishments
Nigga real jewelry no starter kit
Corporate cards that I'm shopping with
Type of broads that I'm spotted with
Type of respect only bosses get
Nigga want a verse well I'ma charge a grip
Unless you a nigga that I started with
Unless you a nigga that's a part of this
California love, look I'm the heart of this
I got the realest flow, I say the hardest shit
No co-signs, do the smartest bids
Started from the bottom, I ain't borrow shit
Self-made young nigga like Ross and 'em
And I got the six, got yo bitch
I ain't cocky I'm confident
You won't stop me, I'm competent
So I don't really need no compliments
Million dollar deals that's common sense
I might let a major label be a part of this, nigga
Be a part of this, if not fuck y'all, give me all my chips
Oh I'm gone keep getting cash, I'm gone fuck these hoes later
Taking care of my fam, cause all the money don't make us
Smilin all on you niggas, shinin' like I'm Las Vegas
Next I see Mitch Booker, I'ma say a prayer for my haters
I'm gone keep getting cash, I'ma fuck you hoes later
Taking care of my fam, cause all the money don't make us
Smilin' all on you niggas, shinin' like I'm Las Vegas
Next time when church say a prayer for yo haters
