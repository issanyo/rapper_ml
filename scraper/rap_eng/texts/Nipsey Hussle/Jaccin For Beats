[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look
Hoppin' off the plane
Blue chucks on the runway
Hussle nigga yeah I only get it one way
Momma said boy you'se a fool stay in school
Last month I made more then every teacher at my school
Come kick it at my pool come swim in my jacuzzi
Watch my big screen you could fuck with all my groupies
Truly young hussle nigga like a boss now
Straight up Slauson to Fox Hills and tear them all down
Five thousand really it ain't nothing fuck browsing
Spend it all double back for more hustling
I'm so south centralised i'm accustomed
To envy I see hatred in his eyes I'mma rush him
Trust no bitches you'll be fucked over lust plus
It's six million ways to die that's just one
I'm one in a million mammas grab your children
Save 'em from the block and what's in back of them buildings
We'll be so on the coast fucking filthy
Rich off racks smokin' cohetes buying real tea
Gold medalist I got to bring the torch home
Speed boating and gettin' my Scott Storch on
Now Al Gore calling me up on my iPhone
Sayin' that the kush that I'm burnin' fuck up the Ozone
09er nigga trying to go fo golds
Nip hustle nigga rich roll or get rolled on
