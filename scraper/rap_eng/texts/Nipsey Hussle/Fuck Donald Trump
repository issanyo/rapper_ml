[Intro]
I think we got kicked out because we're a group of black people and like
I guess people... what's going on in America
They're afraid we're gonna say something or do something
But we just wanted to watch the rally
And to get kicked out because we're a group of black people is really crazy
It shows you how racist our own school is
That we can't even go to our own school conference
[Hook: YG]
Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump, yeah
[Verse 1: YG]
I like white folks, but I don't like you
All the niggas in the hood wanna fight you
Surprised El Chapo ain't tried to snipe you
Surprised the Nation of Islam ain't tried to find you
Have a rally out in L.A., we gon' fuck it up
Home of the Rodney King riot, we don't give a fuck
Black students, ejected from your rally, what?
I'm ready to go right now, your racist ass did too much
I'm 'bout to turn Black Panther
Don't let Donald Trump win, that nigga cancer
He too rich, he ain't got the answers
He can't make decisions for this country, he gon' crash us
No, we can't be a slave for him
He got me appreciatin' Obama way more
Hey Donald, and everyone that follows
You gave us your reason to be President, but we hate yours
[Hook: YG]
Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
I don't like your ass, nigga
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump (I really don't like you,nigga)
I really don't like you, nigga!
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah nigga, fuck Donald Trump (This for my grandma!)
This for my grandma!
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump, yeah
[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Nigga am I trippin'? Let me know
I thought all that Donald Trump bullshit was a joke
Know what they say when rich niggas go broke....
Look, Reagan sold coke, Obama sold hope
Donald Trump spent his trust fund money on the vote
I'm from a place where you prolly can't go
Speakin' for some people that you prolly ain't know
It's pressure built up and it's prolly gon' blow
And if we say go then they're prolly gon' go
You vote Trump then you're prolly on dope
And if you like me then you prolly ain't know
And if you been to jail you can prolly still vote
We let this nigga win, we gon' prolly feel broke
You built walls? We gon' prolly dig holes
And if your ass do win, you gon' prolly get smoked
Fuck nigga, fuck you!
(Fuck nigga, fuck you!) Fuck Donald Trump
[Hook: YG]
Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump, yeah
[Interlude: Donald Trump]
I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words
[Verse 3: YG + Nipsey Hu$$le]
Hold up, I fuck with Mexicans, got a plug with Mexicans
Want a little, need a switch, who I call? A Mexican
This Comedy Central ass nigga couldn't be the President
Hold up, Nip, tell the world how you fuck with Mexicans
It wouldn't be the USA without Mexicans
And if it's time to team up, shit, let's begin
Black love, brown pride in the sets again
White people feel the same as my next of kin
If we let this nigga win, God bless the kids
God bless the kids, this nigga wicked and wigged
When me and Nip link, that's Bloods and Crips
Where your L.A. rally? We gon' crash your shit
[Hook: YG]
Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
