[Hook: Berner]
A few bitches on my line coo
Yea I’m about to act a damn fool
Couple zannys in my system
Got a couple girls kissin’
Keep one and I can’t lose
A few bitches on my line coo
Yea I’m about to act a damn fool
Heart beating fast, how long will this last
Yea welcome to the wax room

[Verse 1: Berner]
Yea I’m high and I’m strapped
Yea I rhyme and I trap
I just made a new strain
Now the price is right back
Copped 4 in the summer
In the winter made 3
Cats sellin’ shit for 2
I’d rather push 3
My sneakers so clean
And my gold chains swingin’
I just blew 2 Ms
On the crib and they ain’t seen it
2 months on the road
New bitches from tour
Pushed my mixtape back
I was playing with pure
The dope game got a hold on me
I heard a sucker went and told on me
Let him die slow
I’m a have to lie low
I’m prolly with the die lows
Let ‘em pies go
28 I had to get my money straight
Late night with a bunny
Cleanin’ lines off the plate
Hella cake, hella cake
I’m a have to push hella weight
Bring tens, sell ‘em 8
I got my weed in every state

Heart beating fast, how long will this last
Yea welcome to the wax room

[Verse 2: Berner]
I’m from the heart of the city
Dirty money like Diddy
Went and got my own water like 50
Haven’t seen my kid in a month
The shit kill me
Got a brand new whip that drive these young hoes silly
Clear wax gotcha feeling like your head cracked
Shit, I just made a quarter million off of extract
And the next batch
That’s head stash
I just wanna ball until the feds crack
The dope game got a hold on me
And this shits getting old to me
Fuck it, a hundred thou’ in a week that’s good money
Baby back it up if you could for me
29 I went broke plenty times
I’m a spend every dime
Baby girl give me mine
Gun play, I don’t miss
I’m a hit every time
I’m the drugstore Cowboy
I’m out every night

Heart beating fast, how long will this last
Yea welcome to the wax room

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Real life, shakin’ real dice
Where every week you almost got killed twice
Speculatin’ what the top feel like
Till you get there on your own and it don’t feel right
Niggas hate you but they actin’ real nice
Enough to make a nigga lose sight
Or enough to make a nigga move right
Get to taxin’ niggas, no deals only full price
That’s for pounds, Os, verses, shows
Pints, clothes fo’ you niggas and hoes
I’m from west side SIXO
Los Angeles street shit
We got the best direct flow
No middle man, I mean I check the reg tho
We grind hard and so my crew collect mo’
So much pressure every night I let go
And call up a couple broads to relieve my stress load
