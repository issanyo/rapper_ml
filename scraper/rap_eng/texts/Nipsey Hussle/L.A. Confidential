[Intro/Ad-Lib]

[Verse 1: Blanco]
Ain't the type of white dude sippin' Bud Light
I'm the type with my nine screamin' thug life
A bad bitch wanna fuck tonight
You ain't shit mother fucker so it's fuck your life
Fuck the DEA, IRS and FBI
There I said it, won't regret it 'til we start trial
I don't ever leave a paper trail
And best believe I'm the G that will break the scale
I'm a hustler, give a fuck about a budget
I'm a gangster, give a fuck about them judges
I'm a monster, middle finger to you suckers
I'm a mobster: Mr. Untouchable
Can't fuck with me, I'm so on some other shit
On a road trip, gotta bring my other bitch
Not my other bitch, my other-other-other bitch
Every brick I flip, the more I'm like fuck 'em

[Hook: 2pac]
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Fuckin' mob figure, west-coast hoorah
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Fuckin' mob figure, west-coast hoorah

[Verse 2: YG]
Niggas hate daily, Glock's my protection
I'm the nigga that your mamma told you not to mess wit'
Caught an interception on your bitch [?]
Give her some dick quick, now watch how fast she collapse
Pusha Ink the label, yeah, been that way since day one
The hoes get around me and me I just gotta say somethin'
I let me chain speak, I ain't really gotta say much
If you see me in the streets, holla suwoop, nigga stay up
I'm all about my dollars, pop my collar on a hoe bitch
She say 'all you wanna do is fuck me', I say 'you know it'
My bitch stolen, my bitch bad
Don't trip cause the homies got the strap
Run up on you fat like the mother fuckin' police
With pistols to your face like 'nigga don't you owe me?'
I'm tryna steal the rap game like a house lit
I'm from the west but I'm tryna fuck a south bitch

[Hook: 2pac]
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Fuckin' mob figure, west-coast hoorah
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Fuckin' mob figure, west-coast hoorah

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Look I'm fresh off the block, I ain't even really left yet
Best on the west, hands down, no question
In my Adidas, got the Slauson boy etched in
And Black Sam keep the money invested
All I do is check rappers off the checklist
And I don't beef, I eat beef for breakfast
And I don't sleep cause these streets is hectic
I don't make peace I just put 'em on my necklace
Real nigga, never ran, never snitched
The old lady on fifth ain't raised no bitch
And we some real niggas, not like them niggas in your clique
I was runnin' 'round talkin' 'bout the lil shit you did
We don't never say nothing about that big shit that we did
We just see each other and nod and you know what it is
And we don't talk about the big shit we did
We just see each other and nod and you know what it is, nigga

[Hook: 2pac]
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Fuckin' mob figure, west-coast hoorah
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
Fuckin' mob figure, west-coast hoorah

[Verse 4: DB Tha General]
DB nigga I be on that dope shit
My junkies be stay ready, be heavy and get your dope, kid
Talking pussy, boy on my momma you ain't shot a stick
This nigga mad, oh well yeah I got your bitch
I heard that he snitching, paperwork bands circulating
Heard this nigga snitch, I swear to God, how the fuck he ate?
Known to bang hands down, I got the brown
You can ask around the town, DB I'm gettin' down fast
I got the gas and gas, gas, gas on top of gas
I'm like 'fuck school, fuck school', never went to class
I act a ass and act a ass I'm like 'fuck math'
They talkin' shit, I swear to God them niggas dumb trash
Black [?] hoppin' out with that black mask
He's talking California, we like 'fuck [?]'
I had cash and had cash and had cash
Me, YG, Nipsey, Blanco, I had to ask

[Hook: 2pac]
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labelled as a thug
