I doo-doo, I poo-poo, I poo-poo, I shit on 'em
I doo-doo, I poo-poo, I poo-poo, I shit on 'em
I doo-doo, I poo-poo, I poo-poo, I shit on 'em
I shit on 'em, you shit on 'em? I shit on 'em, now shit on 'em

I doo-doo, I poo-poo, I poo-poo, I shit on 'em
I doo-doo, I poo-poo, I poo-poo, I shit on 'em
I doo-doo, I poo-poo, I poo-poo, I shit on 'em
I shit on 'em, you shit on 'em? I shit on 'em, now shit on 'em

[Verse 1: Gorilla Zoe]
I spent a fifty on my bracelet
Another hundred on my necklace
I'm leaving skid marks, buckle up
It is five, give 'em bubble guts

Pepperoni, extra cheese, I got shit, I need a Pamper
The haters wanna taste it, tell 'em I might give 'em a sample
All you gotta do, nigga, is watch me ball
Diarrhea on you, nigga, like Niagara Falls

Cause I know how to ball, I buy up the mall
We fuck all the broads, pass 'em to my doggz
Writtin' some new name, speedin' in the fast lane
Tryin' to dodge the chain gang, traffic in the cocaine

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Gorilla Zoe]
If a bitch wanna choose to holla my phone, but I bet I won't call her
But son I bet I won't kiss her is the funk and I bet you gonna miss her
You save 'em, I dismiss 'em, you love 'em, I just diss 'em
You eat 'em, I just shit 'em, it's like some from my picture

Now watch me break this picture this pornographic photograph
Got your baby, mama makin' pornos in a bubble bath
I thought she bathe our way I got back to your place
Cause, baby, I don't love you get the fuck up out my face

I pull up to the club like shit on my car
Shit on my rims, it shine like a star
Shit on the boy to the buy at the bar
Shit on the bar, who you think you are?

Shit on my feet, man, shit on my wrist
Shit on your whip, man, shit on you bitch
Hatin' on me cause the shit I do
I'm shittin' on you like, pee-you

Pussy ass nigga talk shit about me being lame
In the bed who I tore IV
And I be layin' in the bed getting head from
You bitch like she like she ain't B

You shit on us? No we're shittin' on them
Help you out the situation my friend
Since you ain't my kid he got no hands
Puttin' those [Incomprehensible]

[Hook x2]
I shit on 'em, you shit on 'em? I shit on 'em, now shit on 'em
