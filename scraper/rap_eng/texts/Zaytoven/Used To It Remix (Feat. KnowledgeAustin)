[Hook: 1]

Let em know
You know I had to let em know
Pounds of dro
I'm smoking till' my eyes low
I'm moving slow, they wanting me to do more
Remain humble and show them how far you go
Fake ass friends, I'm so used to it
Lowkey I make em sick, but I'm used to it
How can I be mad, I'm so used to it
That shit in my in the past, I'm so used to it

[Verse: 1]

Man I hand to grind from the very start
I'm the only one who can play my part
But I changed their mind they went back on they word
Remember when they kicked out a nigga out to the curb
Posted with the same people swear they the fam
Everybody know me yeah they know that I'm sham
Millions on my mind
Aye
All I gotta do is grind
Aye

Flexing on these muthafuckas, but  it's not on purpose
Really wanna wife her, but I don't know if it's worth it
She been actin iffy and it makes a nigga nervous
I been under for awhile I think it's time to surface
Yeah, and I can make it happen
Disrespect me, make you disappear like magic
Yeah, and now you know what's tragic
Money on my mind and I know I gotta have it

[Hook: 2]

Let em know
You know I had to let em know
Pounds of dro
I'm smoking till' my eyes low
I'm moving slow, they wanting to do more
Remain humble and show them how far you go
Fake ass friends, I'm so used to it
Lowkey I make em sick, but I'm used to it
How can I be mad, I'm so used to it
That shit in my in the past, I'm so used to it

(Yeah, said I'm Used To It)
(Oh I'm Used To it)
(Yeah)(x3)

[Verse: 3]

This is just a product of success
Me and Shambased atcha Neck
You do a lot of verbal I don't flex
But if we callin this a game
Then I'm the King
No debate

Make a couple moves until it's checkmate
Where yo plate?
I'm Out here eating got the Salisbury steak
No fish fillet
I put my name up in the city
Like I'm deep within in the kitty
Then we got into the nitty gritty
Baby you so freaky
Call my homie
Talkin business
Cause we run it, ain't no fitness
Bout to give the boys the money deal
Knowin they can flip it
You should take notes and observe
Cause we comin round the curve
All my homies know the word
So you snakes is never with it

Stackin paper
Feelin better than I ever have

Me and Shamar we been rockin
Since Famous Brick was poppin
Just know we wicked
Got the toys like a Twitter handle
And I could never drop the ball
Got too many handles
I'm gettin cozy, someone get me a flannel
Could never quit until I'm clappin a Jenner named Kendall
I'm just playin my cards
Deck full of aces
We don't hide behind a curtain
We too busy in ya faces
Catchin cases

This is business
Keep it financial or else it's silent
I was brought up from the gutter
We settle disputes with violence
Now I'm trynna keep it peaceful
But people these days is spiteful
If eyes are the window to the soul
I might shut ya blinds

Leavin the past behind
Too much been on my mind
Feelin the pressure
I am the pressure
Read every line
People all up in my DMs
Askin if I'm fine
You ain't care before
So if you say do I know you lying

Mano y Mano
Me vs I
I'm in a position to fall in this abyss
Will I die?
I keep lookin at the sky
Thinkin these answers will come
But on daily
My closest keep tellin me I am the one
So I don't do it for the money
I don't do it for the honeys
I don't do it for the fame
Or the name
Or myself
I do it for the homies
Closest to me
All Respect

But that's the problem
Worry too much for others
I left my self unchecked
