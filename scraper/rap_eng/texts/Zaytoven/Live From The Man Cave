[Intro: Price]
A man, in a world to survive, you gotta have a man cave or some shit somewhere
That shit, that's what I mean, you really got a real deal man cave
You the one, this is a view

[Verse 1: Price]
I told you that I'm motherfuckin' Price
You hatin' and it's motherfuck your life
I brought a pie and you won't touch a slice yeah
When I die, make sure you play "Big Poppa" twice
Baby checked my catalog and found her favorite song
All these rappers fakin' and I refuse to play along
Way too strong, spirit way too strong
Grab some papers and some food don't take too long
Twistin' up in Denver plottin' on endeavors
Get your girls together we about whatever
Pipe it down, roll one up, then watch [?]
Soak up some knowledge, [?] me some game
Ain't go to college, school wasn't my thing
Still I'm so polished like I was on the dean's list, since I was a teen kid
Mama said if you ain't got no heart up in the message then it don't mean shit
Seamstress, I got it sewed together
Me and Grady share a goal together
Me and legendary, yeah they go together
Our raps is fresher and our show is better
Conscious with the paper I won't blow the cheddar
Black queen tappin' into your Coretta I see
Oh you like the tec with the soda better
Well do your shit, I'm finna roll this letter
See I ain't judgin' you cause we could grow together
I just ate all the fuckin' hype

Power levels rising don't you try me, super high me
All up in drive-thru, super sizing, bitch I'm starving, hook a nigga up
Shit, lookin' at me like you don't know me, look a nigga up
Damn, don't talkin' just show me, I'ma need some proof
