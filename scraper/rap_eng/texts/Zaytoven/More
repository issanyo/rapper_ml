Rock a lot of ice but I feel I need more
Count a lot of money but I wanna keep some more
Got a whole lot of hoes but I need a lot more
Whole lot of fresh gear, I'mma go and buy some more
Ran through the bags told my man to bring more
When I get them all in I'mma spend ten more
Man I think I need more then you gonna need a four
And my phone keep ringing and he said he want more
Man I need more, man I need more
Man I need more, man I need more
Man I need more, man I need more
Man I need more, man I need more
Man I need more, man I need more
Man I need more, man I need more
Man I need more, man I need more
Man I need more, man I need more

[Verse 1]

(Skrrt) 911 Porsche, had to feel the force
Switch the gear hear the torque
On my lap is a torch
Pull up in a new ship, after one time I'm bored
Deep pockets yeah of course
Feel a need for speed Lamborghini that's for me
And a .223 I'm knock him off the porch
You don't really want to beef
You don't want to go to war
Chrome Heart that's for me
My girl really like Dior
Pint about a hundred so I'mma need a hundred more
We up in the street a store white ones I need more
Hit the club, fuck it up, throw it up, scrape it up
On the floor baby she already bout to bring more
Drink it by the liter
California sour diesel
You can smell it at the door
Money over bitches over niggas
And I go hard
I think I need more
I think I need more
I think I need more
Cross a little more
I'mma pray a little more
Might pay a little more
Still weigh a little more
Nigga disrespect I'mma spray a little more
Nigga better get in line, obey a little more
I'm the boss, boss man I 'OK' a little more
Fuckin bad bitches and she say she want more
Fuckin bad bitches and she say she want more
When I fuck bad bitches man she say she want more

[Hook]

I need more cash, I need more juugs
I got more rank, I got more pull
I need a big bank, I need some more hoes
Ran out of mids, I need some more 'bows
Scraping the bowl, scraping up O's
I need some more shows, I need some more golds
And when we get it in man that other shit sold
Man them whole O's, man them hoes drove
That's not enough, I really need more
I really need more
I drink a little more
Spend a little more
Here's nine more
I need more whips
I need more clips
Need more flips
A few more trips
A few more zips
The handle of it hot
Need some bigger rims, more inches for my tires
Just a few more and he belong in the sky
Man I ain't lying
I'm serving if you buying
Old hoes keep calling but them bitches get declined
Getting money right now I ain't got time
Got a big bank, bitch I'm gonna shine
Wanna be the shit little more I gotta have it
Gotta have it all baby girl I want more
Really want more man I really want more
Everything gotta go just to go get more
