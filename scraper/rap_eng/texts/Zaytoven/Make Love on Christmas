[Intro]
Are the kids sleep?
They sleep
Yeah, how you feelin'?
I want you
I want you too

[Chorus]
Let's make love on Christmas
Stars are shining bright to set the mood for you and I
Let's make love on Christmas, baby
Underneath the mistletoe, I won't let you go
Until you feel the love between us

[Verse 1]
We been starin' at each other all day
Thinkin' 'bout what we gon' do when the kids go to bed
Ooh, I can't wait to lay you down and get between those legs
Haven't been naughty, I've been nice
Been a good leader, that's what she likes
Sorry Santa, you're out of luck
'Cause her milk and cookies, I'ma eat it up
Ooh, take my time
Let me turn on the Christmas lights
She on her notebook, she so cold
Got me like a kid in the candy store
And it's still a holy night
And it ain't gon' be a silent night
Ain't tryna wake up the kids with the noise
But she can't take it when I unwrap the toys

[Chorus]
Let's make love on Christmas
Stars are shining bright to set the mood for you and I
Baby, we can make love on Christmas (Make love on Christmas)
Underneath the mistletoe, I won't let you go
Until you feel the love between us

[Verse 2]
Ba-rup-a-pum-pum
Not the drummer boy, I'ma beat it like dum, dum-dum-dum
I'ma get so much joy, watchin' us cum together as one
On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me
Good love on Christmas Eve
That's the way it's supposed to be
That's better than any gift under the tree
I want her and she want me
Santa, don't come down my chimney
'Cause it ain't no tellin' what you may see
You might see me feelin' on her booty

[Chorus]
Let's make love on Christmas
Stars are shining bright to set the mood for you and I
Make love on Christmas (Make love on Christmas)
Underneath the mistletoe, I won't let you go
Until you feel the love between us (Between us)

[Outro]
On Christmas (Christmas, Christmas, Christmas)
Can't let you go, on Christmas (Christmas, Christmas, Christmas)
Need makin' love, on Christmas
