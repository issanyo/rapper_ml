Just don't switch up on me baby

[Hook]
All the time i done stayed down, I had ya back thru whatever
You done had my back thru whatever

Got me trippin is it something that's missing
Or is it something that he doing different
Eat ya pussy, said I love you, buy ya things I adore ya
Yea yea I know I fucked up a few times, but never once put em before ya
Got a lil bitch in a porsche love & hate in n out we always hit it out
Tell me what dis shit here really bout, shhh go head and get it out
Just don't sit there on yo instagram
Actin like you don't really give a damn
How could you switch up on me?

[Verse 2]
Fuckin' these bitches don't even like em, they be some lames but good wet
Buncha airheads wit some good head
Look at that shit like a code red
I'm guessin' all of the code dead
You went to switching up on a nigga
I do this shit like for all my niggas
Shit make it hard when it get belittled
Shit make it hard when they don't believe you
Gotta believe gotta walk wit faith
Gotta have standards in anything
Can't just be fuckin wit anything
20 years old had a Range Rover
You know that shit was a change-over
I don't give a fuck it was mine tho
Just like I thought you was mine ho
Playin both sides in the ride tho
You gotta have something you could ride fo
Gotta be something you would die fo
Shit that only you & I know
I take this shit to the grave wit me
Swear this shit going to the grave with me
Feel like a bear I"m just caged in
Father God I been betrayed again!
