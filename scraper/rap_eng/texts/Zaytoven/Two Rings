[Intro]
Lean queen!
V-Nasty in this mufucka
Aye, Chris, turn that shit up
Okay

[V-Nasty: Verse 1]
Said I'm hotter than a flame comin' outta that BIC
And I'm hotter than the AIDS burnin' on that boy dick
And I'm hotter than the bitch that you thought you was with
But that bitch stay choosin'
Now she bringin' me chips

And I'm high everyday when I'm off of that lean
Everybody in my hood call me the queen
35th bitch, I put on for my team
IF you disrespect that, I'mma call the fuckin' scene

Step outside, all white, presidential
Yeah, I'm gettin' money, but bitch that's presidential
Just like Gucci, no pad no pencil
One thing about me, I kill instrumentals!

[Hook]
Two rings, a chain and a medallion
Two rings, a chain and a medallion
Two rings, a chain and a medallion
Three bad bitches, one Asian and two Italian

[Country: Verse 2]
I got a bad bitch every nigga want
She keeps a wet pussy, she from california
Bring the money home, its all on a bitch
I don't fuck with broke hoes, I'm picky bitch

Where the lean at?
I'm tryna nod out
I'm in a Porsche truck, bitch I hide out
I got grab the profit, its at the traphouse
Its time to call the Cubans, bitch I'm on my last ounce

[Hook: X2]
