[Intro]
Ha! S'Gucci!
Suckas keep on downing me
They know they should be crowning me
Hahaha! Yo! It's Guwop
Just counting paper (just counting paper)
We're just counting the days, huh

[Verse 1]
80 chains going and ain't took one yet
Ain't nothing retarded 'bout Gucci but this gold Rolex
A ten thousand dollar bounty put on my neck
I hope you didn't pay them, cause they didn't have no success
You seen my interview, nigga, and you got upset
I seen your interview too, you looked oh so stressed
I think the nigga just mad cause I fucked his ex
And I'm a big dog, he got the lil' boy complex
Go dig your partner up, nigga, bet he can't say shit
And if you looking for the kid, I'll be in Zone 6
I hit a birthday party fresh, you and ya homeboy Tip
I know y'all seen me over there with that black fo' fifth
I bought a Bentley Mulsanne, it look just like Tipâ€™s
But I never went platinum, do you catch my drift?
I never let a nigga do me like Tip did Flip
This the same shit that got Big and 2Pac killed, it's Gucci!

[Interlude]
For the record, this is not a diss record
Just the truth
It's Gucci the living legend
Oh, yeah, I'm a legend
Living legend nigga
Respect that

[Verse 2]
I ain't playing wit ya, I ain't trying to dance wit ya
I ain't using hands, let them rubberbands get ya
It take money to go to war, and we can go to war nigga
I ain't no real rapper, I'm a fucking grave digger
I'm a old school fool, don't make me show my age, nigga
Grab a Louisville and turn it to a batting cage, nigga
I did a song with Keyshia Cole, and I know you still miss her
But Puff was fucking her while you was falling in love wit her
Call you to do a song, wouldn't even smoke no bud wit ya
I was screaming so icy, and was a neighborhood nigga
This AR is my back up cause I don't need nann nigga
Must didn't hear when Flocka said, "Let them guns blam nigga!"
Used to drive to Birmingham with a lot of grams nigga
I'm just who I am nigga but I ain't sparing nann nigga
I know it's hard for you to sleep knowin you killed your homeboy
You left his son to be a bastard, won't even raise ya own boy
