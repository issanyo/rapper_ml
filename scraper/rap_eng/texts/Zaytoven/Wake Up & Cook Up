[Intro: Quavo]
Yeah
Trap Holizay
Migos

[Chorus: Quavo]
Wake up and cook up (cook up), wake up and cook up (wake up)
Wake up and cook up (yeah), wake up and cook up (uhh)
Wake up and cook up (whoa), wake up and cook up (cook up)
Wake up and cook up (wake up), wake up and cook up (aye)
Gotta put my fist in that bowl (in that bowl)
Them niggas is so small, we call 'em tadpoles
You wake up and cook up (cook up), wake up and cook up (wake up)
Wake up and cook up (aye), wake up and cook up (yeah)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I got a (What you got Quay?), appointment set up with your bae
I got a bitch from the Bay, I got a truck out your bay
She telling me give her a taste, I put that dick on her face
I put that dick on her face, yeah, like mace
Pull up and I set up shop, she drinkin' that shit by the shots
Stunt on the block, same spot, pull up and count up the knots (knots)
Niggas out here straight pie, if you hangin' with a group of guys
Better make sure them niggas gon' ride, I pull up like ¿cómo estás?
None of your traps exist, nigga, sellin' that snort to your bitch, nigga
That ain't makin' my dick bigger, count it up and drop it on that fist, nigga
Look at your unc' with that itch, pop that, a nigga won't twitch
Might as well pop at em first 'cause once you press 'em they gon’ say, "I ain't said that shit man"

[Chorus: Quavo]
Wake up and cook up (cook up), wake up and cook up (wake up)
Wake up and cook up (yeah), wake up and cook up (uhh)
Wake up and cook up (whoa), wake up and cook up (cook up)
Wake up and cook up (wake up), wake up and cook up (aye)
Gotta put my fist in that bowl (in that bowl)
Them niggas is so small, we call 'em tadpoles
You wake up and cook up (cook up), wake up and cook up (wake up)
Wake up and cook up (aye), wake up and cook up (yeah)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
30 rounds and the clip clear, make you and the Draco french kiss
Can't stand a dirty-ass kitchen, broke up with my mistress
Took the fork and I bent it, had a Panamera on Emmitt’s
[?] and she pretty, steal her heart away like Penny
Skrrt, yeah, that is the sound, I'm scrapin' the bowl
Momma depend on me, I ain't got kids, I gotta make it back home
One phone call will get you killed, I ain't even gotta scroll
Had apartment with no furniture but at least it had a stove
Turned [?] to whitewater, 'bout to get this splash on
Other day I walked into Gucci, told them folks that I'm back home
Got the city on my backbone, black on like sea bone
Money callin', check the ringtone, Phil Jackson with the rings on
Yeah

[Chorus: Quavo]
Wake up and cook up (cook up), wake up and cook up (wake up)
Wake up and cook up (yeah), wake up and cook up (uhh)
Wake up and cook up, wake up and cook up (cook up)
Wake up and cook up (wake up), wake up and cook up (aye)
Gotta put my fist in that bowl (in that bowl)
Them niggas is so small, we call 'em tadpoles
You wake up and cook up (cook up), wake up and cook up (wake up)
Wake up and cook up (aye), wake up and cook up (yeah)
