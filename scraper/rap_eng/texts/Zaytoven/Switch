[Chorus: Lecrae]
Switch, switch, switch, switch it up
Switch, switch, switch, switch it up
I was a worker had to upgrade to a boss (I had to switch it up)
Used to live in the hood but had to upgrade to a loft (Zaytoven)
Switch, switch, switch, switch it up
Skipped on the Benz, and went and invested the ends
Broke up with my ex, still ended up with a 10
I had to switch it up

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I had to switch it up
I had to mix it up
I was on pills and potions
I had to give it up
I was just workin' for cost
I had to turn to a boss
Put all of my friends in position
Told 'em don't tear down the mall
I told 'em to tear down the wall
Told 'em to study the law
10 commandments, constitution
Told 'em to study it all
You gonna need it boy
This industry greedy
Pray for me keep interceding
I had to switch from telling the world to showing the world
I really believe it
Got probation had to switch the scheme hit you with the plea
Locked my brother up and hid the key ain’t no gettin' me
Doctor King with the pinky ring pull up on the scene
With some 4’s and a time machine now I'm switching lanes

[Chorus: Lecrae]
Switch, switch, switch, switch
I was a worker had to upgrade to a boss
Used to live in the hood but had to upgrade to a loft
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Skipped on the Benz, and went and invested the ends
Broke up with my ex, still ended up with a 10

[Verse 2: ShySpeaks]
I was born at the bottom
Had to work to survive
If you thinking I’m soft, where?
Can’t affect my hard drive
I had an ex who was O, cause I hate to call 'em with zero
But I had to watch what I marvel at, and go and get me a hero
Mind loading
Mind renewing
Download upgrade I had to reboot but I was doing
Me and my old self we had to switch place
I had to clear my memory now I'm loving this space
Was tryna get on the job, but now I own the job
I start telling the squad watch me trust in my God You alive ooh
But I had to reload like troops
New frames new aims
Came with the change brought to the game ooh
Now I’m switchin' lanes

[Chorus: Lecrae]
Switch, switch, switch, switch
I was a worker had to upgrade to a boss
Used to live in the hood but had to upgrade to a loft
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Skipped on the Benz, and went and invested the ends
Broke up with my ex, still ended up with a 10

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Switch it up, switch it up (Switch it up, switch it up)
Switch it up, switch it up (Switch it up, switch it up)
Dropped this game but only the people who get it gon pick it up (pick it up, pick it up, ooh)
I can’t even roll with fools cause they like to roll the shoe (I can't)
My kinfolk was wreckless I hopped in this whip and they told me to hold the tool
I told em pullover fool (skrt)
You riding dirty with a stick
You sippin' dirty with a chick
And you just met her at the strip
See I don’t worry about a snitch (ooh)
Cause I don’t be up in the mix (ooh)
I told my partners I’m gon' switch (yeesh)
And find another way to get it
I’m sick of seeing mommas cryin'
Put the house up for the fines
Bond em out a couple times
Got the lawyers on the line
Said he’s looking at some time
Nah switch it up gave it to God (God)
After that gave him a job (job)
Now I created a squad (squa)
We out here changing the block
Switch

[Chorus: Lecrae]
Switch, switch, switch, switch it up
Switch, switch, switch, switch it up
I was a worker had to upgrade to a boss (I had to switch it up)
Used to live in the hood but had to upgrade to a loft (I had to switch it up)
Switch, switch, switch, switch it up
Skipped on the Benz, and went and invested the ends
Broke up with my ex, still ended up with a 10
I had to switch it up
