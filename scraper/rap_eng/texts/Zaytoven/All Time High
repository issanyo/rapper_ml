[Verse 1: Maceo]
One thing I hate is a snitch ass nigga
Fold on ya homeboy, boy you's a bitch ass nigga
Ain't no way in the hell Maceo gon' ever tell
And if I do, I'll tell ya now, it'll be a cold day in hell
They catch me with a ton, I just pray I make bail
They catch you with an ounce, I swear to God you might tell
I know Mexican connects who be dropping off them bales
Don't talk on the phone they paranoid like two shells
Yeah [?] just land, they came through the mail
You ain't 'posed to ship me, I'm just glad they made it her
My only biggest fear is me fuckin' with a snitch
So I stay up out the way and don't get caught up in no shit

[Verse 2: Mexico Rann]
I'm a real dope boy nigga, fuck DeKalb County
I'm switchin' spots, I'm switchin' whips, I'm tryna duck the bounty
I had a one, I had a hole, I slipped the right street
I made bond nigga now I'm right back on the streets
I gotta watch these snitches and these crooked police
They follow my every move, tryna catch me with the heat
I see you on my bumper, I'm workin' out my beeper
I got that dope here nigga, all between my speakers
These niggas they keep tellin', these niggas they keep squeelin'
I'm dodgin' the pens right now, I'm a convicted felon
We knock him off he tellin', [?] like DMX and Belly
I'm landin' on a lick right now I'm tryna feed my belly
For real

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
