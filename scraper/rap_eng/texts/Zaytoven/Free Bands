[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
All my niggas, yeah, we livin' life free
I don't need no broke niggas 'round me
I know you heard some crazy shit about me (Freebandz)
BMG, thats my own company
Signed myself like I done hit the lottery
I know you heard some crazy shit about me (Yeah, Freebandz)

[Verse 1]
Don't worry 'bout what nobody think, gotta keep jugging
See the big picture, big screens, like the movies
Motion pictures in the hood
Got the Boyz n the Hood, whipped the work
And hit the block with Ice Cube
In the jugg house, eight prices, pick and choose
I just got two thousand pounds, sold 'em in a day or two
The drought, no bricks, I can make a few
Sell 'em off for ninety-five hundred, make four hundred bands
'Cause all my niggas bosses just like me
BMG, thats my own company
Five drugs, I'm a street pharmacy
I got cash (Yeah)

[Chorus]
All my niggas, yeah, we livin' life free
I don't need no broke niggas 'round me
I know you heard some crazy shit about me (Freebandz)
BMG, thats my own company
Signed myself like I done hit the lottery
I know you heard some crazy shit about me (Freebandz)

[Verse 2]
Really I don't even need the industry
I got tickets thats tied up on the streets
Told my mama quit her job, its on me
Just know that
Bought that 'Rari just to hurt these niggas face
Got them hatin', know they hope I catch a case
Catch me hustling, catch me jugging every day
I'm working
Fifty thousand in each pocket of my jeans
That's two-hundred-thousand dollars on me
Signed myself like I done hit the lottery
I'm flossing

[Chorus]
All my niggas, yeah, we livin' life free
I don't need no broke niggas 'round me
I know you heard some crazy shit about me (Freebandz)
BMG, thats my own company
Signed myself like I done hit the lottery
I know you heard some crazy shit about me (Freebandz)
