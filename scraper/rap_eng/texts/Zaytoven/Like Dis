Talkin' shit, poppin' shit like this
Talkin' shit, poppin' shit like this
I ain't never seen a nigga pop this much shit
You ain't seen a nigga rock this much shit

[Verse 1]
I'm a fat boy in some skinny jeans
With 20 grand in my pocket
Got a Rolex on my wrist
Cost 50 thousand just to rock it
That's some young hoes that stay, boy
I fly in, no sky miles
Fly in, no sky miles
Fly in, no sky miles
Got the new crib and the sky house
Nigga talkin' 'bout Trip, nigga
Nigga talkin' 'bout Trip, nigga
Got different condos and different buildin's
Got different cars off different cities
Got different tabs and they foreign
That's some young hoes, she foreign
They love when I'm tourin'
See me backstage with Jay
That lemonade, that tour now
Young nigga, I'm here now
I put my foot and I'm here now
2016 the year now
2016 the year now
My diamonds look clear now
My diamonds look clear now

[Hook]
Talkin' shit, poppin' shit like this
Talkin' shit, poppin' shit like this
I ain't never seen a nigga pop this much shit
You ain't seen a nigga rock this much shit
Talkin' shit, poppin' shit like this
Talkin' shit, poppin' shit like this
I ain't never seen a nigga pop this much shit
You ain't seen a nigga rock this much shit

[Verse 2]
I'ma front on you nigga year round
Give you somethin' to talk about
A Bentley coupe outside your house
Put a big backyard in my mom's house
They wanna see me go crazy
My mama keep sayin' calm down
If I come off, I'm a king
You best believe that it's goin' down
Nigga tried to just warn ya
Nigga BMo just came out
White party, 88 bottles
Ace of Spades, a lil Ros√©
Bought a whole case for the hoe favors
Hoes diggin' my feng shui
Got a real plug say from the Bay
Get them bags right here to the A
I'm gettin' real money like I'm Mitch
My Rolex got the biggest face
I got real diamonds, put in bitches face
Buy the Ace of Spades, nigga buy the case
If I ever catch a charge
My homeboys comin' by the K
[?] keep it 'bout the way
Real plug that stay out the way

[Hook]
Talkin' shit, poppin' shit like this
Talkin' shit, poppin' shit like this
I ain't never seen a nigga pop this much shit
You ain't seen a nigga rock this much shit
Talkin' shit, poppin' shit like this
Talkin' shit, poppin' shit like this
I ain't never seen a nigga pop this much shit
You ain't seen a nigga rock this much shit
