[Intro: OJ da Juiceman]
Aye, aye, okay
Juice, Gucci, Juice, Gucci
Half a brick, half a brick
Zaytoven, Zaytiggi
Aye, aye, aye, okay
Okay, okay, aye, aye
So Icey Entertainment

[Chorus: OJ da Juiceman]
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, aye
Quarter pound, half a pound, whole pound, okay
Hundred pills, thousand pills, serving major weight
Juiceman and Gucci Mane make the trap, "Aye!"
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, aye
Quarter pound, half a pound, whole pound, okay
Hundred pills, thousand pills, serving major weight
Juiceman and Gucci Mane make the trap, "Aye!"

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm twerking birds in, so we working
Packing a truck, stop, a trailer back in
We big flip jugs, we took it off the forklift
The way my plug kick it, you'd think he had a black belt
My scale so big, Big Boy can weigh his damn self
Two thousand pounds of mid, I sold that shit my damn self
Washer full of cash, dryer full of X pills
Red rag in my pocket same color my 'Vette is
My number lower than a ee√© from Texas
A quarter mill in the mail is an investment
A sniper rifle like a soldier in the desert
An Eagle on me, boy, I'm known to tote a Desert
I sacked an ounce up before I sold a record
He want a brick, I told him, "Meet me by the Checker's"
I sacked a pound up before I sold a record
He want a bale, I told him, "Meet me by the Checker's"

[Chorus: OJ da Juiceman]
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, aye
Quarter pound, half a pound, whole pound, okay
Hundred pills, thousand pills, serving major weight
Juiceman and Gucci Mane make the trap, "Aye!"
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, aye
Quarter pound, half a pound, whole pound, okay
Hundred pills, thousand pills, serving major weight
Juiceman and Gucci Mane make the trap, "Aye!"

[Verse 2: OJ da Juiceman]
I'm booming, I'm bunking, I'm serving all the babies
Rap game easy, but the dope game gravy
Young Juiceman and my life is like the J. Kidd
With stupid fruity crazy swag, jumping on your lady
Banana donk Chevy interior like the Lakers
LeBron James wrist when I'm fucking with that cake up
Hit the trap, stay down, watch the paper rake up
Booming out the house and J's asking for a wakeup
Half a brick, whole brick, got me buying Jacobs
Maury shoe-walking and and the head a N.O. gator
Half a brick, whole brick, got me buying Jacobs
Maury shoe-walking and and the head a N.O. gator

[Chorus: OJ da Juiceman]
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, aye
Quarter pound, half a pound, whole pound, okay
Hundred pills, thousand pills, serving major weight
Juiceman and Gucci Mane make the trap, "Aye!"
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, aye
Quarter pound, half a pound, whole pound, okay
Hundred pills, thousand pills, serving major weight
Juiceman and Gucci Mane make the trap, "Aye!"

[Verse 3: OJ da Juiceman]
Young Juiceman, goddamn it, I'm the shit
Booming off the chain, working with fifty bricks
Thousand pound bale, trying to make a mega grip
Posted on the 'Crest with that .45 on my hip
Thirty-four, thirty-four tucked behind my lip
760, dog, with that extra lip
502 donk, dog, with that extra kick
I got them stupid bands 'cause I got that stupid whip

[Chorus: OJ da Juiceman]
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, aye
Quarter pound, half a pound, whole pound, okay
Hundred pills, thousand pills, serving major weight
Juiceman and Gucci Mane make the trap, "Aye!"
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, aye
Quarter pound, half a pound, whole pound, okay
Hundred pills, thousand pills, serving major weight
Juiceman and Gucci Mane make the trap, "Aye!"

[Outro: OJ da Juiceman]
Aye, aye, aye, okay
Damn, damn, Zay, Zay
Damn, damn, Juice, Juice
Damn, damn, Gucc, Juice
Juice, Gucc, Zay, gone
Okay, aye, aye
Juice, Gucc, Zay, gone
