[Bridge: Future]
Chanel 6, I sign on
Fully loaded, that Scion

I'm blowing money like the fan on
I swear that this voucher could dance on you
Murder squad, I stand on you
No facade, I stand on you
I swear to God I stand on you

[Hook: Future]

[Verse 2: Maceo]
You can tell I'm havin' bitch, I ain't gotta manage it
All of my diamonds be here, you can tell by the clarity
We rockin' red diamonds, you rockin' the rhinestones
Act' in my styrofoam, I'm gettin' my grind on
These niggas just hate that I'm gettin' it
Well fuck it, I sold out the citadel
Some of these gas bags and the trash bags
Got you wonderin' where the stash at
We robbin' (?) no handgun
I'ma put on for my day one
Real come get, no Akon
Pink grass look like Barry Bonds
You think I ain't back with a check?
You think I ain't got no finesse?
You think my niggas ain't killers?
You think that my niggas won't aim at your head?
Drop a check on you, you a plate now
Right price, you get ate now
Whole city know I'm havin' it
Bands in and I'm taxin' it

[Hook: Future]
Yeah-yeah, we havin' it, we havin' it, we havin' it
