You know all I want it all, and some more

Bitch you ain't gone menage, you gotta go, gotta fucking go

You look at me say I'm the shit

[Hook: London Jae]
Down dripping water, fully loaded forty
Fully loaded dash buy getting past the border
With the niggas auto, taking nigga order
Fully loaded dash buy getting past the border

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I like my windows with views
I like my women in two's
Vision like dub in the trunk
I like my trunk in the hood
Pull up I'm missing my ceilings
I get these niggas the blues
No bitches left out the condo
Had to deliver the news
Movers went up in the building
Elephant's now in the room
I got my chance on the million
Y'all niggas square as a cube
Asking me all of them questions
Bitches like family feud
You better get up on your job
Cause my niggas after the u

[Verse 2: London Jae]
Living life on the edge, I already with no pace
Chandelier hang on my neck, cut through fuck over check
Learn to get a mega hope
I cut the bitch and get the dough, forgot her
Got her shaking at the folly
Dropping that audemar
Got these bitches drippin' molly
Got 20 bitches in the lobby
Flip a brick and blow the private
All my niggas rich I'm plug with the cipher
Got me shinin' bone in public
50 shots don't mention nightly
Ghetto Batman and Robin
Boy I love this damn body!

[Hook: T.I.]
You know all I want it all, and some more
And some fucking more
Bitch you ain't gone menage, you gotta go, gotta fucking go
I put it on my life, on my life, on my fucking life
You look at me say I'm the shit
You motherfucking right

[Hook: London Jae]
Down dripping water, fully loaded forty
Fully loaded dash buy getting past the border
With the niggas auto, taking nigga order

I'm gonna be send us some more toons
I'll be rich, nigga I'm gonna be rich
You gonn' see a lot of thangs but never see me switch

You and your crew support the jays
They do whatever the money say

You know I'm gonna buy, you know I'm gonna stunt
I used to walk the L way, now I want for nothing

You know all I want it all, and some more
