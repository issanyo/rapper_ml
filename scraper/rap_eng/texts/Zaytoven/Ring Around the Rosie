[Intro]
Hah
Ayy Zaytoven don't play with this beat right here
I got 'em, 6
Ring around the rosie on your block
Hop out on your ass with fifty shots
Nah this ain't the chorus though, fuck it, hah
(Never have I ever, nigga)

[Chorus]
Ring around the rosie on your block (on your block)
Young nigga gettin' to the gwap (to the gwap)
Straight green lights, I can never stop (I never stop)
I was at the bottom, steady reachin' for the top, ayy, ayy
Now I finally finally got my spot (got my spot nigga)
Now a nigga finally fuckin' thots (now I'm fuckin' thots nigga)
I don't gotta post up on the block (post up on the block)
You can smell what I'm cookin' like The Rock nigga (what you cookin' then?), 6

[Verse 1]
Groupie shakin' ass, it don't amaze me (it don't amaze me)
She keep tellin' me she gon' have my baby (what?)
I guess she know that Lil 6 goin' crazy (goin' crazy)
Got Blue Ivy diamonds like I'm Jay-Z (like I'm Jay-Z)
And Beyoncé (Beyoncé), on a one-way (one-way)
Run up on Lil 6, it's straight gunplay (baow nigga)
Free El Chapo bitch, yeah the dumb way (free Chapo)
Hundred choppers in the Sprinter, this a fun day
I know one day, that these people gon' regret it ('gret)
Real extortion gang, I'll take a nigga necklace
Strip your whole body with that fuckin' Smith 'n Wesson
'Member I got shot, boy I swear this shit a blessin', 6

[Chorus]
Ring around the rosie on your block (on your block)
Young nigga gettin' to the gwap (young nigga getin' to the gwap)
Straight green lights, I can never stop (could never stop)
I was at the bottom, steady reachin' for the top (to the top, ayy)
Now I finally finally got my spot (now I finally finally got my spot)
Now a nigga finally fuckin' thots (I'm fuckin' thots nigga)
I don't gotta post up on the block (I don't gotta post up on the block)
You can smell what I'm cookin' like The Rock nigga (then what you cookin' then?)

[Verse 2]
I'm really really really in the 6 (in the 6)
A nigga fly as hell like a pigeon (like a pigeon)
Just walked up in the club, don't act silly (don't act silly)
Crack a nigga head with a bottle of that Henny, ayy
But I'm still trippin', jippin' off that Remy (off that Remy)
And you know that forty cal come with a fifty (it got a fifty)
Knock it out the park like Ken Griffey
Like ebola, niggas knowin' I'm the sickest, ayy, ayy
Got your main bitch, choo choo, it's a gang train
I don't gang bang but I'm still yellin' gang gang
Let my chain hang, if you touch it, nigga bang bang
Been with the same gang since a nigga had a no name

[Chorus]
Ring around the rosie on your block (on your block)
Young nigga gettin' to the gwap (young nigga getin' to the gwap)
Straight green lights, I can never stop (could never stop)
I was at the bottom, steady reachin' for the top, ayy, ayy
Now I finally finally got my spot (now I finally finally got a spot)
Now a nigga finally fuckin' thots (I'm fuckin' thots nigga)
I don't gotta post up on the block (I don't gotta post up on the block)
You can smell what I'm cookin' like The Rock nigga (like The Rock), 6

[Outro]
Ring around the rosie on your block
Ring around the rosie on your block
Ring around the rosie on your block
Ring around the rosie on your block
Nigga, 6
