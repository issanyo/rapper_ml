[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus: Lecrae]
Get back right, I had to get back right
Get back right, I had to get back right
Get back right, I had to get back right
Fell off, lost my cool (whoa Zay')
Bounce back, got dirt on my shoes, jump back right
When you got real power, you can't lose
I had to get back right, I had to get back right

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Top down, hair back (skrt)
Ride by the HYPEBEAST on Fairfax (true)
Monday morn', I don't wanna hear trap (no)
I play Rick James when I'm in traffic
I've been doin' this since fifth grade (woo!)
I've been doin' this since I've been saved (woo!)
I've been rocked crowds on a big stage (I did)
I've been made hits with some big names (I did)
Yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda
Bought a Mercedes for my baby momma
VIP rockin' Dolce & Gabbana
I went to the Grammys and I took my momma
Bottles on bottles on bottles and models
On models on models and dollars on dollars
Yeah, that don't help me when my soul wanna holla
I'm feelin' the pain and I'm dealing with drama (woo)
That's too deep (too deep), yeah, guess I better fall back
Nah man, get this work (go get it), you shoulda wore a hard hat
They told us don't work in the summer (don't do it)
I told 'em I'm workin' on somethin'
I'm wavin' my banner, no propaganda
Why you flexin' in your Panamera? (woo)

[Chorus: Lecrae]
Get back right, I had to get back right
Get back right, I had to get back right
Get back right, I had to get back right
Fell off, lost my cool (whoa Zay')
Bounce back, got dirt on my shoes, jump back right
When you got real power, you can't lose
I had to get back right, I had to get back right

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
I don't really stress, I pray more, dear Lord, stretch my queso
I've been doin' this since you was like, "ocho nuevo playin' with your Legos"
Look, I don't cap, I rap facts, you can go and check the stats
You and your squad versus me and my God
Look, bro, you ain't finna win that now (nope)
Was a season when I thought that I had fell off (fell off)
Then I set back like, "You crazy, boy, you know you well off"
Everything I had was rented, Nissan, on the side it was dented
No tint, you could see who was in it
At the mall, I was pinchin' my pennies, in the beginning
Jimmy Jazz for the clothes, TV Johnny for the gold
Them was the goals, never cared about my soul
"That can wait 'til I get old," I'm on theseâ€“ hold up
Wait a minute, new beginnings, I was down, now I'm winnin'
I know who did it and I won't forget it
You know I'm still about the family business
I had to get back

[Chorus]
Get back right, I had to get back right
Get back right, I had to get back right
Get back right, I had to get back right
Fell off, lost my cool (whoa Zay')
Bounce back, got dirt on my shoes, jump back right
When you got real power, you can't lose
I had to get back right, I had to get back right

[Outro: Zaytoven]
Yeah, one time, this Zaytoven checking in
Zay' and Lecrae, Kingdom business, believe that
All gas, no breaks, yeah, we going full force with it, believe that
Let the Trap Say Amen, yeesh
