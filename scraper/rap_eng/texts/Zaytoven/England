[Intro] Gotta big bankroll on fold...

[Hook - Quavo]
Big bankroll on fold
Trappin' out the top of condo
Cause you see the niggas skeezin'
Had to move my money outta England
England, England
Pounds, pounds on me like the king of England
England, England
Pounds, pounds on me like the king of England

[Verse 1 - Quavo]
Quavo, Quavo, Quavo
Pull up and I got the pounds
King of England, diamonds under my pinky
Fuck is you thinkin'?!
My niggas, they keep the extension
Car's not rented
Young nigga, I cash out on Bentleys
Get to the door, the 50s the 100
I'm watchin' you scraping up pennies
Chasing the reggie like [?]
In Venus, yo bitch, she suckin' my penis
(Pow pow pow) Watchin' you skeezin'
You a fuck nigga and I mean it
Got pounds, king of England

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Takeoff]
King of England, you niggas rookies
I am a veteran, smokin' on clickers
[?] flexin', but I'm not wrestlin'
Yo bitch, she textin', my bitch the queen of England
Elizabith II, my nigga, we're droppin' the pound
The Nino Brown, and he got arrested
I'm laughing at niggas, Chris Rock
I walk around on the block
I got the molly santana, you take a rock, you jungle [?]
I'm whippin' that dope, no miracle
Hop out that limo, pull out the red carpet
Like 80 Coming To America
Plottin' on me is hysterical

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Foolie]
El Chapo Jr
I got pounds, pull up in yo town, choppa hundred rounds
Goin' down, betta ask around
(Foolie you really be trappin'?)
Bitch, I'm makin' it happen
Got pictures outta the condo
Foolie the Prince, makin' a call to my Migos
He pullin' up pronto
Bitches they paying my rent
Migo west 700
Taking a trip and we landing in England
Bitches they black and white, lookin' like penguins
Trappin' alound in London, trappin' on more in London
Niggas, they skeezin' we beef for no reason
I throw a skimask when we ain't even skiing
West coast, nigga

[Hook]
