[Intro]
Aye
I'm gonna say a lot of shit with -ation on it
You know what I'm sayin'?
A.T.I.O.N, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Hook]
He listened to Chief Keef once and he turned gangster
I'm spinning in this bitch like some turn tables
I was fucking on your bitch while you were waiting
While she had your ass waiting like you were a patient
I'm with my black bitch going to get my Caucasian
Bring that M-16 out for some certain equations
This shit ain't adding up says my fucking calculation
I'm on the road I got that hoe doing masturbation

[Verse 1]
I up this pistol and this bitch start doing evaporation
I'm going fast in my car my shit stay calibrated
I seen a million dollar lick you know I had to take it
Blue faces call my phone you know I had to take it
I do this shit on my own fuck your collaborations
I don't need no I.D check my verification
I hear Johnny on the phone tell him elaborate me
Just to pull up to your party boy you gotta pay me
Bitch you gotta show me something bitch immaculate me
What the fuck makes you perfect? Practice baby
I call up Zaytiggy I ain't beat jacking baby
I got a hundred dollar in each pocket of my jacket baby
Hopped out on your hoe she said, "You cappin' baby"
I ain't a crack baby I'm a capper baby
Hoe you can get off my boat I'm the captain baby
I treat the bullets like a ship how I sail it baby

[Verse 2]
The police pull me over and I'm intoxicated
I'm tryna see what the fuck they determination
They wanna take me out and then incarcerate me
'Cuz my car look like a bad ass moderation
Hoes say I ain't easy it's some complications
I don't do the cuffin' bitch pick up your desperation
Have my Uber drop you off what's your destination?
Vegetarian vegetation me aspiration
Told that bitch to add it up, can you do multiplications?
Imma need some mesmerization for my recreation
Every time I hop out it's a celebration
I don't need you or your damn consideration
I ain't shaking hands unless I like the the negotiation
Aye I curse too much I ain't good at appropriation
To go and pick up the damn cake that's my damn operation
I'm that nigga I ain't with the rest of the population
