[Hook: 2x]
My bitch got mad cause my fucking phone kept ringing
That bitch didn't say nothin' when them mockingbirds was singing
Bitch I'm gettin' money
Bitch I'm gettin' money
So bitch stop asking
You harassing

[Woman]
Quavo, come here come stand by me
Quavo, when you gon come talk to me

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I'm cooking and rapping and chickin(??) it crazy
That bitch over here keep spazzin' on me
Goddamn, boutta make young nigga go ham
Pull up pass 100 to the fam
No Shaq(??) but a nigga got slammed
She calling my momma, she tell her I'm selling
I think that she pregnant, I hope that she ain't
I'm smokin' all day, this bitch in my face
When a nigga go to sleep I don't even feel safe
Man I swear this bitch so cray
She cray, she talkin' bout having my babies
She cray
Too cray

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Cookin' and flippin' and whippin'
She callin' my phone the moment you trippin'
I'm in the middle of the kitchen ______________________ I drop in the trenches
She naggin' she flipping she's tellin'(??) my momma
Tellin' me __________________ (??)
But them chicken they bought you, them Jimmy Choos now you all around taking Instagram pictures
I know that the Feds they watchin, like Nikki Buns up in Harlem
Meet the plug with the bat, ________ (??) the money I pull out the carbon
Give it up, fuck nigga, it's a robbery
Got some niggas in the hood that are robbin' for me
Migos we the new Outkast and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony

[Hook x2]
