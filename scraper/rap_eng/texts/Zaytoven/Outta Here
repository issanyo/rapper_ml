[Intro: PeeWee & Quavo]
Longway Longway Bitch (Migos)
MPA Bandcamp in the building nigga

[Hook: Quavo]
Diamonds shine like chandeliers
Birds in the water place your order on the cruise-ship
Custom clear the package over night they tryna juug deals
Got 2 dope mans in front of my Bando
Chopper with the full clip
Take em outta here, Take em outta here, then we outta here

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
I remember looking at my Audemar
Juugin' pounds of the OG, custom cleared
Bricks of the fish it look just like Veneers
Fresh out the boat with Migo and Pablo we working them deals
My dope man got 2 rifles ready to clear
Got a D.C. Sniper up in Beverly Hills
For that guala they gonna take em outta here
Dabbin in Balenciaga Gear, let your bitch wrap the
Fuck that bitch on the truck bed and we outta here
Corners on my neck a walking chandelier
My Skydweller water you can leave the camera
I get the whips and forgiato’s mounted
Overnight the pack to Alabama
Fuckin’ up the kitchen and the counter
Blue M&M’s at the telly, tell the bitch suck the dick

[Hook: Quavo]
Diamonds shine like chandeliers
Birds in the water place your order on the cruise-ship
Custom clear the package over night they tryna juug deals
Got two dope mans in front of my Bando with the full clip
Take em outta here, Take em outta here, then we outta here
Diamonds shine like chandeliers
Birds in the water place your order on the cruise-ship
Custom clear the package over night they tryna juug deals
Got two dope mans in front of my Bando with the full clip
Take em outta here, Take em outta here, then we outta here

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Birds coming in like Pirates of the Caribbean
Call me Johhny Depp
Yo money is looking real funny I'm laughing at you call you Mike Epps
Go one hundred cause you need help
I'm playin with the water like Michael Phelps
Versace on to impress em
I'm smokin' gas, Willie Nelson, uh-huh (Gas)
Call me Quavo Presley, uh-huh
Pull up with that chopper nigga hesitant (glaawww)
They say that Heroin they say it look like Hershey Nestlé
(cook up, skrt!)
I do no talking they say I get it from Mexicans
Migos and Longway we been trappin' a long day
50 approach you with that chopper you come the wrong way

[Hook: Quavo]
Diamonds shine like chandeliers
Birds in the water place your order on the cruise-ship
Custom clear the package over night they tryna juug deals
Got 2 dope mans in front of my Bando
Chopper with the full clip
Take em outta here, Take em outta here, then we outta here
Diamonds shine like chandeliers
Birds in the water place your order on the cruise-ship
Custom clear the package over night they tryna juug deals
Got two dope mans in front of my Bando with the full clip
Take em outta here, Take em outta here, then we outta here
