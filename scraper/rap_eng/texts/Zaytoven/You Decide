[Intro: Usher]
(Zaytoven)
Yeah, been a minute
But I still feel the same
Yeah, yeah
You know I want you

[Chorus: Usher]
Give me another chance to be your man, be your man, no
I promise I won't let you hurt again, hurt again, no
Don't be afraid, baby, take my hand, take my hand, no
Give me another chance, give me another chance, oh
Just give me another chance, give me another chance, oh

[Verse 1: Usher]
Girl I can't lie, things are just not the same without you
The sun just don't shine no more
All it does is, all it does is just rain without you
Girl I ain't too proud to beg, your love is that good
I miss the thrill, baby, girl if I could...
Show you how I matured, I'm ready to settle
Ready to take this love to another level

[Bridge: Usher]
What's up with you and I, you and I, babe?
Let me back in your life, second try, babe
Between them thighs, spread
Girl you decide, girl you decide-cide, babe
Girl you decide, girl you decide, oh

[Chorus: Usher]
Give me another chance to be your man, be your man, no
I promise I won't let you hurt again, hurt again, no
Promise I'll never hurt you again
Don't be afraid, baby, take my hand, take my hand, no
Give me another chance, give me another chance, oh
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh)
Just give me another chance, give me another chance
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh)

[Bridge: Usher]
What's up with you and I, you and I, babe? (Babe)
Let me back in your life, second try, babe
Between them thighs, spread
Girl you decide, girl you decide-cide, babe
Girl you decide, girl you decide, oh

[Chorus: Usher]
Give me a chance to be your man, be your man (Oh)
Said I'll promise to be better or whatever it takes (Oh)
Oh, yeah
Girl just let me back in your life
Give me another chance to be your man, be your man, no
Give me another chance, I'll promise to be better, baby
I'll promise I won't let you hurt again, hurt again
I promise I won't let you hurt again, oh no
Don't be afraid baby, take my hand, take my hand
Don't be afraid to take my hand
Give me another chance, give me another chance, oh
(Give me another chance, give me another chance)
Just give me another chance, give me another chance, oh
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh)
