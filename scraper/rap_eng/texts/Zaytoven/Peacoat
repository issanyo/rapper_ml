Peacoat, Burberry, fours aww man

[Verse 1: Future]
Yeah, yeah, Future Hendrix
I spent a check on that pussy
I put Moet on that pussy
I go to war 'bout these cookies
I got it like "wooh!" when I'm cooking
Valet the car on that water, water
I fuck her now she got water, water
Eat on her, sleep on her, peep on her then I might pull out my dick and I pee on her
She 21 keys like a piano
I fuck around serve you a piano
And I keep the Burberry, dripping like raspberry
Sauce for the matters, you don't even matter
Codeine coming out my bladder
Gotta kill all the chatter, yeah, yeah
We go to Soho to get you Manolo
I'll put Chanel on your mojo

[Verse 2: Future]
Pardon my luggage, Vuitton Don
I was the one sipping Chandon
She got that number one pum pum
I'ma fly her out to Kingston
Fuck them receipts, I'ma throw away
I spent the cake on a throw away
We do the yacht on some fun fun, we kickin shit on a daily basis
We fuck around and gone make a baby
I be in Prada like Perry Ellis
She told her ex, "Farewell"
I see what she'll do for a pair of heels
Got you popping them Perc's like an Advil
You found out Future bought a Burberry
She found out Future bought a Burberry
Future cut her off like K-Camp
