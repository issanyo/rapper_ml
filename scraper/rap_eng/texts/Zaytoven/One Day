[Intro]
I pray every night 'bout this shit (I know one day)
I talked to TJ about this shit, rest up TJ, rest up Kendre (6)
I don't what the fuck happened, I wasn't even there when it happened but shit (some day)
Judge died in my face though, we slid

[Chorus]
I know one day, that I gotta make a way
One day, man we chasin' all this yay
I say one day, fadeaway, Michael J
One day, we gon' make it some day
Some day, hope I make it one day
My dog prayed, and he died Sunday
Gunplay, it be a lot of gun play
I'm on Sycamore, don't ride down that one way

[Verse 1]
'Member I was down on my dick, nobody ain't give me shit
Had to hit lick after lick, had to sell brick after brick
'Member I got my first stick, couldn't stop clutchin' my shit
'Member I got my first stick, couldn't stop clutchin' my shit
Dropped out of school, was a badass
Put a nigga ass in a trash bag
Say you want smoke, you don't want that
Young nigga sippin' on Cognac
Went to school, gun in my backpack
Whole lot of smoke, you don't want that
TDB see his block, boy we on that
Run up on me, I'll push a nigga's dome back
Two-two-three (ayy), seven six two, five five six
Hundred rounds, double stop, reverse the clip
Two alter egos, got the devil in my ear
I'm in love with karma, 'cause I know that lil ho real, 6

[Chorus]
I know one day, that I gotta make a way
One day, man we chasin' all this yay
I say one day, fadeaway, Michael J
One day, we gon' make it some day
Some day, hope I make it one day
My dog prayed, and he died Sunday
Gunplay, it be a lot of gun play
I'm on Sycamore, don't ride down that one way

[Verse 2]
I'm on 6 block, and I'm posted with my goonies
No pulling up, 'cause my shooters they get loony
You run up on me, forty cal, I get groovy
In the stolen car, it's a truck, green Suzuki
Pussy boy you got me bent, remember the money we spent
Let that bitch hit, pull up on you with a stick
Boy you only talk 'round your clique
Four-five got a kick, Madden, I'm callin' a blitz
Oh shit, there go Lil 6
I'm tough as a bitch, I heard the shooter gon' snitch
Forgive, but never forget nigga, 6

[Chorus]
I know one day, that I gotta make a way
One day, man we chasin' all this yay
I say one day, fadeaway, Michael J
One day, we gon' make it some day
Some day, hope I make it one day
My dog prayed, and he died Sunday
Gunplay, it be a lot of gun play
I'm on Sycamore, don't ride down that one way
