[Hook: 21 Savage]
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
I just cooked another brick
I just cooked another brick
I just cooked a whole brick
I just whipped another brick
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
I just cooked another brick
I just cooked another brick
I just cooked a whole brick
I just whipped another brick

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I'm water whipping in the kitchen
Shit on niggas like a pigeon
Tie your kids up like a ribbon
(Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Baking soda on the stove
Dad knocking at the door
He don't want nothing but a nickel rock, man
We gone send him to the store
I just bought a whole
I whipped it out the bowl
Mac 90 with the 100 round drum
Nigga and it fold
I'm sticking to the code
Wipe a nigga nose
I'm Murder Gang Savage
And I slaughter niggas' hoes

[Hook: 21 Savage]
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
I just cooked another brick
I just cooked another brick
I just cooked a whole brick
I just whipped another brick
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
I just cooked another brick
I just cooked another brick
I just cooked a whole brick
I just whipped another brick

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Young Savage cooking crack
Sonny rolling grams of wax
Margiela cost a rack
Say my name I'll get you whacked
Streets need Gucci back
Smoke a nigga like a black
Want a million dollars, want a new Ferrari, wanna fuck Karrueche in the trap
I'm smoking on a pound of dank
Make the dope lock up in the sink
I wanna fuck you, but I can't
That pussy musty, bitch you stank
Medication all I drank
VVS, it make you faint
Rifle singing like Tank
I'm water whipping to the bank

[Hook: 21 Savage]
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
I just cooked another brick
I just cooked another brick
I just cooked a whole brick
I just whipped another brick
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
Water whipping in the kitchen
I just cooked another brick
I just cooked another brick
I just cooked a whole brick
I just whipped another brick
