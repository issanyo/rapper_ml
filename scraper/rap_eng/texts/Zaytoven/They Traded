[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Niggas thought they want success, I'ma tell you what this shit come with nigga
Uh, yeah, look

[Chorus]
Mama traded on me, partners hated on me
Baby mama even had some robbers waiting on me
The streets [?]
I should've left that bitch when she broke my heart the first time
I swear to god I'm gifted, I came for [?]
I hope the lord forgives me, I ain't have a spot to live in
They could've killed me but it built me I uplifted by myself
They wanna milk me try to jail me but I built it by myself, yeah
Came in the game like a running back, tell 'em that I need my money back
Tell the father I ain't coming back, every day I try to run from that
They could've killed me but it built me I uplifted by myself
They wanna milk me try to jail me but I built it by myself, yeah

[Verse 1]
They did not think I would make it this far, they love me today but hate me tomorrow
I bought her a house, I bought her a car, why the fuck does she keep asking for more
I done seen rich niggas go back to poor, I done seen [?] fuck up the score
They won't let me in, I broke down the door
Won't let me get mine, then I'ma take yours

[Hook]
Mama traded on me, partners hated on me
Baby mama even had some robbers waiting on me
I'ma do my motherfucking thing nigga, y'all [?] a motherfucking thing nigga [?], hah, let's do it

[Verse 2]
I gave it my all, I never gave up
If you know what it took you wouldn't take it from us
They made a lot when I didn't make much, now on the lottos them niggas on hush
Who can can I trust, I trust my niggas
I trust my bitch I bought all of them pistols
[?] I don't even sizzle, I stood up [?]
I came in the game, I fucked up the game 'cause these niggas lame
They fuck with my chain, them pistols gon' talk and they gonna say bang
Them rappers ain't talk 'bout no motherfucking thing, your rapping is over you better go sing
Fuck what you bring, fuck what you [?]
We shoot that bitch up you think it's a game
I had these niggas on Twitter, I meant to show 'em the pistols
I feel sorry for your sisters, I might fuck on Christmas
Niggas talking shit until they hear them pistols pop out
Try me if you want it, you gon' get your ass knocked off

[Chorus]
Mama traded on me, partners hated on me
Baby mama even had some robbers waiting on me, yeah
They could've killed me but it built me I uplifted by myself, yeah

[Bridge]
Something that [?]  between an artists that's coming, and me, you or someone [?], something like that
What did they say?
They said that the two of you guys that were wearing security shirts were walking around with rifles on, and walking around back here
I want to give you guys the perfect opportunity to leave because you've been asked to leave, I don't want to press it any further ok?
So we're giving you that opportunity now to just go ahead and bounce, alright?

[Outro]
Yeah fuck nigga, I ride around this motherfuckin' city by my motherfuckin' self
Not a motherfuckin' security in sight, everybody in the city know my motherfuckin' car nigga
That white Hellcat, that white Corvette nigga
You know we be buying shit just to crash it nigga, huh
You bought your motherfuckin' jewelry off shows nigga
I bought my jewelry off dope money nigga
I came from the bottom nigga, West side of Atlanta nigga
Niggas know not to come here on West end nigga
Police done got killed over here fuck nigga
Better go do your research nigga
Ahk shit, pop shit
