(Chorus)
Any other time
You would wanna come over here with me
But every other night
You wanna be with your home girls in the streets
Is you riding, is you riding?
Cuz if you is, let's go
Is you riding, is you riding?
Cuz if you ain't, then I'm gone

(Verse 1)
She don't even use it, but if you saw her on Snapchat
Catch my girl legs open, man, you better smash that
Don't be surprised when she ask "where the cash at?"
Don't be surprised when she ask "where the CashApp?"
She love to stack them digits
She wear a bunch of Fendi
She like to max the limit
She in love with Saks and Lenox
Don't even act offended
Cuz she 'bout her business
And her blouse expensive
Got about a thousand in it

(Chorus)
Any other time
You would wanna come over here with me
But every other night
You wanna be with your home girls in the streets
Is you riding, is you riding?
Cuz if you is, let's go
Is you riding, is you riding?
Cuz if you ain't, then I'm gone

(Verse 2)
Mami got that body and she move like Bugatti
Ohio Player coming from Cincinnati
If you got a minute, let me holla at you, shawty
We both know you bad, but can you get naughty?
You talk a good game, but is you really 'bout it?
Got you on my brain, but my judgment ain't clouded
What I bring to the table, I'ma let you think about it
I remove the shadows, now you don't even doubt it

(Chorus)
Any other time
You would wanna come over here with me
But every other night
You wanna be with your home girls in the streets
Is you riding, is you riding?
Cuz if you is, let's go
Is you riding, is you riding?
Cuz if you ain't, then I'm gone
