[Hook]
All this money got me nonchalant
And stuntin’ on bitches, I be blunt
You see all this sauce on me
I’m the freshest in the joint
I give her the dick then I’m out of there
She like you ain’t shit boy you ought to care
I’m like mhm whatever
Still gon’ let me fuck whenever
I’m like mhm whatever
Still gon’ do whatever I tell her
I’m like mhm whatever
Time is money, ask the bezel

[Verse 1]
Mhm, whatever
Bout my money, gettin’ fella
Bout the cheese like Chester
Dropped a backend on a bezel
Know ‘em with the three letters
CMG on the charm
Bread gang in my pocket
Groupie hoes in the lobby
After we fuck then get up
I’m nonchalant when I nut
I be like go’n bitch, leave
She like you wrong and stuff
She like you ought to care but I can’t
Show her so much money, make her faint
Jewelry like water dripping in the sink
Pull up in a big body like a tank
Balmain cashmere coat
Seventeen-hundred the price
Move around the city catching bombs
Old school Jerry Rice
I might pull up and serve you everything
Then I roll like some dice
Got to be in the air, onto the next site
Louis luggage on the flight

[Hook]
All this money got me nonchalant
And stuntin’ on bitches, I be blunt
You see all this sauce on me
I’m the freshest in the joint
I give her the dick then I’m out of there
She like you ain’t shit boy you ought to care
I’m like mhm whatever
Still gon’ let me fuck whenever
I’m like mhm whatever
Still gon’ do whatever I tell her
I’m like mhm whatever
Time is money, ask the bezel

[Verse 2]
All this money got me nonchalant
Roll me up a three five blunt
Throw my neck back, pop a pill
Sixteen O’s, let’s crack a seal
I get it in then get it gone today
Found my feature, pull up then drive away
If it ain’t ‘bout money when we conversate
I be like umm whatever, I’m straight
Side bitch head ain’t ‘bout shit
So I hit up bae and let her do it
She gon’ put her neck into it
Spend some, she gon’ make a nigga do it
I’m in my lane doin’ me
They tryna block my shine, Patrick Ewing
Only thing on my mind is eating
So I’m selling dope while I’m touring
Hearing rumors ‘bout robbing me
I ain’t goin’ for it and you know it
I keep that thang on me
You gon’ hug god if I blow it
Money coming out my pores
Ran it up from the soil
When I come down off that oil
I be nonchalant on you whores

[Hook]
All this money got me nonchalant
And stuntin’ on bitches, I be blunt
You see all this sauce on me
I’m the freshest in the joint
I give her the dick then I’m out of there
She like you ain’t shit boy you ought to care
I’m like mhm whatever
Still gon’ let me fuck whenever
I’m like mhm whatever
Still gon’ do whatever I tell her
I’m like mhm whatever
Time is money, ask the bezel
