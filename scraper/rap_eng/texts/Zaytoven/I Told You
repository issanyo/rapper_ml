[Intro]
Woptober, Wop
Finally, huh, this the finale, yeah
Huh, it's Gucci, go

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
These slides are Buscemi
My drawers and wifebeaters Givenchy
A nigga so handsome
These white women say that they want me
They say that I'm country but I'm number one in the country
It's no need to tell me, I know you lil niggas is hungry
Mike Will and Zay beat
I'ma ride that bitch just like a 10 speed
My chick is a dime piece
I bought her some shoes that cost 10 G's
These bitches is grimy, befriending my bitch to get round me
A nigga so shiny, they just wanna gawk at my timepiece
From the top and I'm not stopping till the money stop
I used to cook with several pots
But now my hands in several pots
You try to plot on 'Wop, my goons gon' play connect the dots
My knot so big it slap you cross your forehead and it left a knot

[Hook: Young Thug]
I told you, I told you
I told you, I told you
These boys didn't believe in me
I showed you, I showed you
My bitch my lil whoadie
My bitch from Magnolia
Surrounded by bad bitches
We up without Folgers
We live by that cash talk baby
We live by that cash talk
I'm riding in Nascar baby
I'm tearing up that asphalt
They know not to play with us, baby
We strapped like the black hawks
I got that boy leaking out blood
I got that boy getting chalked, yeah

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Now tell me the problem now
I cut that head like a barber now
They told me them boys in there
I'ma pull up on you, war right now
The cops know we mobbing now
I'ma go end what you started now
We used to be dead broke
Now we gon' do it real larger now
You know I'ma vet it
Gone but they sipping synthetic, ay
They told and you let 'em
These fuck niggas fake as they bezels, ay
My gold from Brazil
I got my shit out of treasure, ay
You gotta wrap the weed 10 times, its smelly, ay
Split the 'rello, smoking kush in cigarellos, hey
Get them birdies, let them fly without propellers, hey
Get the P, run up the door, lift up and accelerate
Drive the Wraithy, when it rain for the umbrellas, ay

[Hook: Young Thug]
I told you, I told you
I told you, I told you
These boys didn't believe in me
I showed you, I showed you
My bitch my lil whoadie
My bitch from Magnolia
Surrounded by bad bitches
We up without Folgers
We live by that cash talk baby
We live by that cash talk
I'm riding in Nascar baby
I'm tearing up that asphalt
They know not to play with us, baby
We strapped like the black hawks
I got that boy leaking out blood
I got that boy getting chalked, yeah
