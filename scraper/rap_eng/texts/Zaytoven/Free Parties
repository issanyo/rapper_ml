[Intro]
Zaytoven
Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy, PontiacMadeDDG, ayy

[Chorus]
I pull up at parties that only got free shit, ayy
I pull up at parties that only got free lit, ayy
Don't pay for no parties I'm on VIP list, ayy
Don't send me no flyers unless it is free, bih, ayy
I pull up at parties that only got free shit, ayy
I pull up at parties that only got free lit, ayy
Don't pay for no parties I'm on VIP list, ayy
Don't send me no flyers unless it is free, bih, ayy

[Verse 1]
I pull up to the party with my whole squad, we lit
I-I got drunk as hell up off some free shots gang, gang
Don't text me at the party 'less it's free, my shit
I just threw up all over this dude broad
Pissed in the bitch, I got no cash
Not finna spend 10 the party and the party ass
I'm just finna to call Billy Bob back from math class
(Yeah, dude we're frickin' lit, and we charge no cash!)
[?] a lick, bobbing and shit
Moving in circles, I'm nauseous and shit
I got class in the AM but give no fucks 'cause I'm partying, bitch
Droopy and shit, crispy the fit
Turnt the fuck up 'cause this party legit
I am so lit, I cannot quit
Been dabbin' for hours there's nowhere to sit

[Chorus]
I pull up at parties that only got free shit, ayy
I pull up at parties that only got free lit, ayy
Don't pay for no parties I'm on VIP list, ayy
Don't send me no flyers unless it is free, bih, ayy
I pull up at parties that only got free shit, ayy
I pull up at parties that only got free lit, ayy
Don't pay for no parties I'm on VIP list, ayy
Don't send me no flyers unless it is free, bih, ayy

[Verse 2]
PontiacMadeDDG, stepped on the scene
Ciroc with the apple and green
Wobbly dabbin', vibin' and clappin'
Next morning don't even know what had happened
He-headbangin' [?] asprin
Paper late, my professor be snappin'
Got some lunch, boy, that pizza was slappin'
Back to dorm, where I'm usually nappin'
Ibuprofen couldn't fix on my ache
Missed the quiz over stuff that was late
Now I'm failin', man, that shit a mistake
Make a nigga wanna jump in a lake
Checked my grades and I thought they was fake
In my feelings had to listen to Drake
Lookin' sad, niggas askin', "You straight?"
Lowkey think I'm takin' a break
A nigga education really at stake
Shawty goin' [?] since he got cake
I need to study but I know that I ain't
Man, fuck it, I am not finna flake
Tutor texted me but I told her I can't
I'm drunk as hell and all my niggas is baked
Free shots till a rich nigga faint
It's all free, I ain't touchin' my bank

[Chorus]
I pull up at parties that only got free shit, ayy
I pull up at parties that only got free lit, ayy
Don't pay for no parties I'm on VIP list, ayy
Don't send me no flyers unless it is free, bih, ayy
I pull up at parties that only got free shit, ayy
I pull up at parties that only got free lit, ayy
Don't pay for no parties I'm on VIP list, ayy
Don't send me no flyers unless it is free, bih, ayy
