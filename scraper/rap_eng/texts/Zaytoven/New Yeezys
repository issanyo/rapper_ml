[Verse 1]
Hello there people
Umm what are you doing today
I just copped yeezys I bought for no reason
Like Derrick Jeter fuck your lil bitch giver her semen
Then I take off in my beamer they callin' me beamy
I'm a stupid motherfucker
I fuck your bitch up on covers
Boy you stupid man you love her
I swear to God I don't trust her
You goofy you sucker
Trust on that bitch you a sucker I burn you like Usher
Whole time my clique dust ya
Whole time my clique rush ya
I ain't even gotta talk everybody know I'm ballin' Dave and Busters
You a loser you a sucker
Boy you mustard gotta ketchup

[Verse 2]
Yeezys they right on my fucking feet
I fuck your lil bitch man every week
She suck on my dick[?]
Woah yea, Chains everywhere yea
Diamonds yea they everywhere
Yeezy right here every where
