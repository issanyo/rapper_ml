[Intro: Gucci Mane & Lil Will]
Gucci Mane La Flare
Yeah, where yo ice at?
Where yo chain and yo ring at?
Where yo bling at?
I'm icy, I'm icy, so icy, so icy
I'm so icy, I'm icy, so icy, so icy

[Chorus: Lil Will]
All these girls excited
Ooh, you know they like it
I'm so icy, so icy
Girl don't try to fight it
All your friends invited
I'm so icy, so icy

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Got a house around my neck and my wrist on chill
Any given time, 250 in your grill (a quarter million?)
All I do is talk shit
You can even add a couple grand for my outfit
Yeah, you better act like you know man
In my hood they call me Jeezy the Snowman
You get it? Jeezy the Snowman
I'm iced out, plus I got snow, man
Let it marinate, y'all niggas slow man
(Man what the fuck y'all? Dumb ass)
I used to get nineteen for a beat
Call me Ginuwine, the same 'ol G
I'm the shit bitch, I need toilet paper
And some air freshener nigga, fuck a hater
These niggas don't like me
I'm with the Gucci Mane and I'm so icy

[Chorus: Lil Will]
All these girls excited
Ooh, you know they like it
I'm so icy, so icy
Girl don't try to fight it
All your friends invited
I'm so icy, so icy

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
She digging my fitted, she think I'm the shit
Is this the chain on my neck, or the watch in my wrist
Maybe the ice in my ear, or my bracelet
But she look like the type that could take a dick
Young Gucci Mane
Don't kiss me baby, you can kiss my chain
You gotta be a dime piece
Just to look at the rocks in my time piece
I come through in a drop top Jag
Or a old school Chevy with the antique tags
My pockets so heavy that I can't walk steady
Niggas copping ice we done done it already
Got a gold grill but it's not from Eddie
I ride big Chevys cause a nigga ain't petty
I'm icy, so motherfucking snowed up
Little kids wanna be like Gucci when they grow up
Me, Jeezy and Boo
We ain't hatin pussy nigga 'gon and do what you do
Cause we icy, so icy, we icy, so icy

[Chorus: Lil Will]
All these girls excited
Ooh, you know they like it
I'm so icy, so icy
Girl don't try to fight it
All your friends invited
I'm so icy, so icy

[Verse 3: Boo]
Yeah, I'm hoppin' out the range wit the seats piped out
You can still see my chain even when the lights out
Cause that's how mobsters do it
Spit a little game, give 'em that flossin' music
I'm the man from the C-H-I
These lames runnin' 'round thinkin they so fly
Got a little buzz but Boo been too high
I'm pullin' hoes in the club and I don't even try
I guess when she glance at my wrist, she wanna get my dick
I tell her holla at Jeezy if you wanna pop Cris
Get at Gucci Mane cause he on some hood shit
And you know I'm in the cut, grippin' my .45
Like let a nigga trip, naw we ain't runnin'
We just takin all your chicks, buyin' drinks, gettin' blunted
Groupies, show you how to do this son
We throwin' out hundreds while you savin them ones, nigga

[Bridge: Lil Will]
I got so many rocks, in my chain and watch
I know I'm the shit, my chain hang down to my dick
I know I'm the bomb, just look at my charm
I know I'm the shit, my chain hang down to my dick

[Chorus: Lil Will]
All these girls excited
Ooh, you know they like it
I'm so icy, so icy
Girl don't try to fight it
All your friends invited
I'm so icy, so icy

[Outro: Lil Wil]
I'm so icy, look at my charm
My, chain, hang, down, to my dick, hahahah
