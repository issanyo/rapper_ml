[Intro]
Yeah
Zaytoven
Hey
You know I remember them nights I was fucked up too, nigga
Yeah, ya did
Shit wasn't always pretty
Yeah

[Chorus]
I remember them nights I was fucked up
Nigga used to pray, I used to look up
Gotta have it in ya heart just to want some
Gotta stay down 'til ya come up
Yeah fuck nigga, not a sack up
Fuck every nigga, get smacked up
Yeah fuck nigga, not a sack up
Not a sack up, not a sack up

[Verse 1]
Not a sack up, not a sack up
All you flexin' niggas better back up
We got them racks on fire
Walked in this bitch smellin' like a pound
Tourin' through your hood in a [?] truck
Strapped up, we don't give no fucks
I remember them nights I was fucked up
Nigga had to grind 'til I came up
Yeah I hit the ground 'til I came up
They hatin', that shit won't add up
Used to have the sack, now ya bankrupt
Still spendin' bucks so you dumb fucks
I remember I was in the gutter
I didn't have shit but my brothers
And we ain't have shit but the hustle
Nigga gotta make it out the struggle, hey

[Chorus]
I remember them nights I was fucked up
Nigga used to pray, I used to look up
Gotta have it in ya heart just to want some
Gotta stay down 'til ya come up
Yeah fuck nigga, not a sack up
Fuck every nigga, get smacked up
Yeah fuck nigga, not a sack up
Not a sack up, not a sack up
I remember them nights I was fucked up
Nigga used to pray, I used to look up
Gotta have it in ya heart just to want some
Gotta stay down 'til ya come up
Yeah fuck nigga, not a sack up
Fuck every nigga, get smacked up
Yeah fuck nigga, not a sack up
Not a sack up, not a sack up

[Verse 2]
I remember them nights I was hungry
Some nights nigga we was homeless
In the projects me and my homies
Gotta stay down if you want it
Serve more gas than the BP
Kirkwood nigga, I'm an OG
Real Kirkwood nigga, ask Gucci
Playin' with the keys like Swizz Beats
Just pulled a producer [?] for auntie
Young nigga, still trappin' on the front street
Young nigga, keep the stink if you want beef
Nigga think he sweet but he gon' see
Young nigga shoppin', we poppin' them tags
Walk to the counter, I'm droppin' the bag
Remember them nights when I didn't have
Now a nigga up, so you do the math

[Chorus]
I remember them nights I was fucked up
Nigga used to pray, I used to look up
Gotta have it in ya heart just to want some
Gotta stay down 'til ya come up
Yeah fuck nigga, not a sack up
Fuck every nigga, get smacked up
Yeah fuck nigga, not a sack up
Not a sack up, not a sack up
I remember them nights I was fucked up
Nigga used to pray, I used to look up
Gotta have it in ya heart just to want some
Gotta stay down 'til ya come up
Yeah fuck nigga, not a sack up
Fuck every nigga, get smacked up
Yeah fuck nigga, not a sack up
Not a sack up, not a sack up
