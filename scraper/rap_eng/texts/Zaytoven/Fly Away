[Intro: Lecrae]
Fly away, away, away, away
Fly away, away, away, away
Fly away, away, away, away
Fly away, away, away, away
Zaytoven

[Chorus: Lecrae]
I don't know where I'ma go
I just wanna hit the road
Slim Thug on the 4's
Top-down let it flow
I don't know if I belong here
Tell my momma Ima miss here but I gotta go yeah
Things just ain't the same, Things just ain't the same, man
I don't care what it cost, man
I just need an off day
Gotta let it go
Had to switch up on em all
Maybe I'll fly maybe I'll fall
Gotta let it go

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I was so gone
Hadn’t seen my people in a minute it been so long
Yeah I say I love em but I know I treat em so wrong
That’s probably why I had to get away
Cuz I ain’t wanna make em feel that way
I pray that I can make right again
I was so low, low, low
I ain’t have no where to go whoa, whoa, whoa
Things just fell apart
Everybody fell apart, everybody played a part, everybody played a role
Gotta change the episode

[Chorus: Lecrae]
I don't know where I'ma go
I just wanna hit the road
Slim Thug on the 4's
Top-down let it flow
I don't know if I belong here
Tell my momma Ima miss here but I gotta go yeah
Things just ain't the same, Things just ain't the same, man
I don't care what it cost, man
I just need an off day
Gotta let it go
Had to switch up on em all
Maybe I'll fly maybe I'll fall
Gotta let it go

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Things just ain't the same, things just ain't the same, man
And even though we change we don't change the same way
Things just fell apart, everybody fell apart
Everybody played a part, everybody played a role, gotta change the episode
Maybe I could be a different me, Maybe you could be another you
We can find another galaxy, fly away from all the vanity
Away, away, we can fly away

[Chorus: Lecrae]
I don't know where I'ma go
I just wanna hit the road
Slim Thug on the 4's
Top-down let it flow
I don't know if I belong here
Tell my momma Ima miss here but I gotta go yeah
Things just ain't the same, Things just ain't the same, man
I don't care what it cost, man
I just need an off day
Gotta let it go
Had to switch up on em all
Maybe I'll fly maybe I'll fall
Gotta let it go

[Verse 3: nobigdyl.]
Stress since they medicate our best intentions
Young and reckless we just flexing 'cause we pessimistic
My confession, I just hope my ex is watching
Gotta girl and she's a blessing but I play the best imposter
Tell me no lessons, uh, don't need no message, uh
Yeah, I need your presence, uh, you are my blessing, uh
Clean up my senses, tear down my fences, clean up my messes, uh
If I don't pick up, yeah, please leave a message

[Chorus: Lecrae]
I don't know where I'ma go
I just wanna hit the road
Slim Thug on the 4's
Top-down let it flow
I don't know if I belong here
Tell my momma Ima miss here but I gotta go yeah
Things just ain't the same, Things just ain't the same, man
I don't care what it cost, man
I just need an off day
Gotta let it go
Had to switch up on em all
Maybe I'll fly maybe I'll fall
Gotta let it go
