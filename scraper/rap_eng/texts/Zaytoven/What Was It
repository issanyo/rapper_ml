[Hook]
I come through lights and cameras
Watch got me tripping
She like, "Buy me something", no I ain't your nigga
It tastes so good, this here what I'm sipping
What I am is what I am naw I ain't flipping
Got shooters in the trenches
Bad bitch do the dishes
Maid do my laundry, come in here you'll be missing
I got all these hunnids, that is how I does it
She like, "You know my name?", naw bitch what was it?

[Verse 1]
No tears in the bucket but it's fuck it
Think I'm from the Rucker how IÂ´m causing ruckus
Three point shit bitch I'm shooting buckets
My car caught her at the light and he told her suck it
Bitches see me they be tweaking say they love me
Why was it because my pants so puffy
Four thousand for this Gucci and it's fluffy
I come through clownin' like I'm Krusty
Bang, call me Sosa Balboa
I got a bad temper like Florida
She think 'cuz she got a peach like Georgia
She want me to wife her but I gotta get my lawyer

[Hook]
I come through lights and cameras
Watch got me tripping
She like, "Buy me something", no I ain't your nigga
It tastes so good this here what I'm sipping
What I am is what I am naw I ain't flipping
Got shooters in the trenches
Bad bitch do the dishes
Maid do my laundry, come in here you'll be missing
I got all these hunnids, that is how I does it
She like, "You know my name?" naw bitch what was it?

[Verse 2]
I'm GLO'd up put the cameras on me
Don't try I got the hammer on me
I'ma scoop your bitch in a minute
She'll think I'm gonna love her
But I see her in a minute, gotta get me a dental
Pull on her make her crippled
It could not be so simple
I want you to go down, you can do the cha cha limbo
My car be slicing Kimbo
Margielas fuck your Timbos
I come through I'm capping, remember when I was little
Got me shittin' on your Rollie, I don't want baloney
I want me some steak, I want me some money
I want me some fifties, I got me some hundreds
Just to keep it 100, this clip hold hunnids
What's up under my hood, you don't wanna see it nigga
I take money you don't wanna be it
Man I come from the hood, now I'm rich preaching
It ain't about the money, then I can't see it

[Hook]
I come through lights and cameras
Watch got me tripping
She like, "Buy me something", no I ain't your nigga
It tastes so good this here what I'm sipping
What I am is what I am naw I ain't flipping
Got shooters in the trenches
Bad bitch do the dishes
Maid do my laundry, come in here you'll be missing
I got all these hundreds, that is how I does it
She like, "You know my name?" naw bitch what was it?
