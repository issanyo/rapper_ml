[Intro]
Zaytoven!
(Pour drank on the carpet)
Sosa baby, GBE baby
(The haters, they talk shit)
Bitch, yeah, yeah
(Got your hoe free from an auction)

[Chorus]
Had to take one second
To think about all these motherfucking blessings
Yeah, I got a license but I'm driving real reckless
Designer done turned to a fetish
She gon' eat the hot dog cause I get the relish
Come and get this work cause you know I gotta settle it
Before I get the coupe, yeah, you know I gotta test it
Cause I cut into this hundred thousand and invest it

[Verse 1]
In the strip club, throwing money like it's nothing
Smoke that bitch out, now the police fussing
Make the po' man nigga know that we coming
Shorty on X, don't tell me if you see something
And what I'm smoking smelling like I'm eating onions
Remember growing up like I gotta be something
All this fucking cake like I gotta eat something
And I'm tryna quit but the drank keep callin'

[Chorus]
Had to take one second
To think about all these motherfucking blessings
Yeah, I got a license but I'm driving real reckless
Designer done turned to a fetish
She gon' eat the hot dog cause I get the relish
Come and get this work cause you know I gotta settle it
Before I get the coupe, yeah, you know I gotta test it
Cause I cut into this hundred thousand and invest it

[Verse 2]
Pour drank on the carpet
We on our guap shit
The haters, they talk shit
But later, they walking
Got your hoe free from an auction
She steady talking
I be steady flossing
Organizing boss shit
(Bang, bang-bang)

[Chorus]
Had to take one second
To think about all these motherfucking blessings
Yeah, I got a license but I'm driving real reckless
Designer done turned to a fetish
She gon' eat the hot dog cause I get the relish
Come and get this work cause you know I gotta settle it
Before I get the coupe, yeah, you know I gotta test it
Cause I cut into this hundred thousand and invest it

[Outro]
At the strip club, throwing money like it's nothing
Smoke that bitch up now the police fussing
Shorty on X, don't tell me if you see something
L what I'm smoking, smelling like I'm eating onions
Remember growing up like I gotta be something
All this fucking cake like I gotta eat something
And I'm tryna quit but the drank keep callin'
Drank keep callin', drank keep callin'
