"hood rich, hood rich"
[Bankroll Fresh]
Yeah
Imma be clear with this shit man
Gotta stay focused and go get what i want, ya dig it?
{STREET!}
You can see it in my eyes and in my voice you hear the hunger
Man I'm going hard
And to the top is what I conquer
I bowl over you bitch ass niggas
Just to be honest
Middle finger to the world and fuck ya (??)
Ya (??)
You can see it in my eyes and in my voice you hear the hunger
Man im going hard
And to the top is what I conquer
Move over ya bitch ass niggas, just to be honest
Middle finger to the world and fuck ya (??)
Ya (??)
{HOOD RICH,HOOD RICH}
To all ya nigga shit yeah
Let that bitch know
No worries motherfucker
'cause i am grown
And i stand on my own
I stimulated my mind
I knew it would get better every time, with time
Every time, it will matter
You see me climbing the ladder
Man all these niggas they hate me
We in these streets, be careful
These niggas really don't care
They take from when you feed 'em
What the fuck is wrong with these niggas
Why they mamma didn't teach 'em?
Why they mamma didn't got em?
Why they preacher didn't heal 'em?
I'm going hard motherfucker
I help the ones who ain't selfish
I don't owe you niggas
I tell you that every time
Man the realest is in here
And this is more than a rhyme

CHORUS
You can see it in my eyes and in my voice you can hear this hunger
Man I'm going hard
And to the top is what I conquer
Mow'n over ya bitch ass niggas
Just to be honest
Middle finger to the world and fuck ya (??)
Ya (??)
