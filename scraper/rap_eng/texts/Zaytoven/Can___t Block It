[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
Snakes gotta watch em, They gon try and block your blessings
Keep faith always know God got me
No you can’t block my blessings
They don’t want to see me on top
I can’t let 'em block my blessings
Keep hustlin' keep pushin' don’t stop
You can’t let 'em block your blessings
If it rain my parade don’t stop
I can’t let 'em block my blessings
I just dropped the top on the drop
If they gon watch gon let em
Snakes gotta watch em, I can't let 'em block my blessings
Keep faith always know God got me
No you can't block my blessings

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Came through the block
Heard somebody got they people
Said lil' L got shot
I wonder why the world so evil
Young boy only 15
Had em laid out so mean
He was tryna stack that cream
Stead of tryna ball on the team
He was tryna ball in the streets
Y’all know the scene
Haters tryna box me out
They tryna lock me out
No no no
They tryna bring me down
I had to change my route
Gods’ hand on me ain’t nobody that can stop it
What he planned for me ain’t nobody that can block it
Came from the bottom now I’m drippin' like a faucet
Tell em game over 8 ball corner pocket

[Chorus]
Snakes gotta watch em, They gon try and block your blessings
Keep faith always know God got me
No, you can’t block my blessings
They don’t want to see me on top
I can’t let 'em block my blessings
Keep hustlin' keep pushin' don’t stop
You can’t let 'em block your blessings
If it rain my parade don’t stop
I can’t let 'em block my blessings
I just dropped the top on the drop
If they gon watch gon let em
Snakes gotta watch em, I can't let 'em block my blessings
Keep faith always know God got me
No, you can't block my blessings

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Tell mama don’t worry 'bout them people anymore
I been in the gym and I don’t miss my free throws anymore
I'm tryna take my shot
They tryna change they plot
I changed my circle
She just want them bottoms red, her top to drop, her labels purple yeah
8:28 out the gate
All things work for my good I'm straight
Get a little money gotta watch for the snakes
They gon try and take food off your plate
Boy this life can be a jungle
Everybody a Mutombo tryna block a shot
And trip you tryna make you fumble
They don’t want to see me humble
Run with pride, pride of lions by my side
They will eat a man alive
God told me vengeance is mine
So I don’t even try
I just wait for His reply yeah

[Chorus]
Snakes gotta watch em, They gon try and block your blessings
Keep faith always know God got me
No, you can’t block my blessings
They don’t want to see me on top
I can’t let 'em block my blessings
Keep hustlin' keep pushin' don’t stop
You can’t let 'em block your blessings
If it rain my parade don’t stop
I can’t let 'em block my blessings
I just dropped the top on the drop
If they gon watch gon let em
Snakes gotta watch em, I can't let 'em block my blessings
Keep faith always know God got me
No, you can't block my blessings
