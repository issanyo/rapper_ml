Get money nigga
Get money nigga
City goin' live
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Get tucked down, nigga
We getting' more packs, nigga
We seein' more racks, nigga
We don't fuck with racks, nigga
See through these niggas like glass
I'm rollin' up out the bag
These fuck niggas lookin' mad
'Cause a nigga runnin' through the cash
Bags of the mid in the loft, nigga
Don't get it confused, you know I'm a boss nigga
Thousand pounds, migo drop him off nigga
Play games we gon' get checked, you get offed nigga
Sixty floors up at the loft, nigga
That's my safe house, its the vault, nigga
Margielas and Balenciagas
We gon' turn up them suckas 'cause we know they watchin'
And we gon' flex up on them niggas, we gon' blow the profit
And we gon' re-up with the plug, a couple hundred thousand
I mean we came up out the jungle, out the public housing
I mean a nigga can't complain I saw some meals up out it
I mean these niggas stealin' swag don't make me see up out 'em
I mean they look up to a nigga, I can't bitch about it
We keep the K's in the trunk, you see the blaze when I dunk
Since fifth grade I been tucked, young nigga baggin' up the dust
Used to give crack to my uncle, [?] trap the whole summer
Them feds snatched up my brother, but four-four got me out the struggle
I mean we came out the dirt, hittin' donuts in the 'vert
Had bands off the perc, workin' out the church
But that was back in '05, we had the city goin' live
BMF was on fire, but the city had to [?]
At the party at the [?], nigga all them ho mine
Made the city close at three, they had the bitch open till five
Threw a parade and blazed, all these bitches gettin' slayed
None of these hoes get saved, young nigga with big bank
[?] 'bout them drug lord, taught me to work for it
Stay far away from these fuck boys, rental cars for decoys
