[Intro]
Lil baby
Bitch I know you a thot, I'm a thot too, shit
Fuck it
Yeah, 6

[Chorus]
Come here girl, what's your name?
Do you wanna hang with my gang?
Do you wanna rock my fuckin' chain?
Know you tired of fuckin' with them lames

[Verse 1]
Know you tired of fuckin' with them squares
Balenciaga, bought your ass ten pairs
Fuck it, we gon' turn up to the roof
Disappear on they ass like poof
'Cause you know Lil 6 ass, he the truth
Pussy boy I gave your ass the juice
How the fuck you tryna steal the flavor?
Florida boy, I'm fucked up 'bout them gators
Nah girl, we ain't stuntin' on haters
Fuck it, beep, 'bout that paper
Fuck it man, let's make everybody so mad
Walked in the mall, walked out with a hundred four bags
Fuck it man, we ain't lookin' at tags
Whatever you want, I'll even buy you that Jag
That i8 V8, that shit go so fast
Leanin' off that molly, hope I don't crash

[Chorus]
Come here girl, what's your name?
Do you wanna kick it with my gang?
Know you tired of fuckin' with them lames
Know you wanna rock a nigga's chain

[Verse 2]
Know you want me to rock you like a boat
Know you want that new fur coat
Fuck it, I might disappear like a ghost
'Cause I hope your ass don't do the most
We tacky but we matchin' and we dabbin'
These niggas, they some bitches and they crabbin'
You knowin' that Lil 6, that boy not average
Hit you from the back, you screamin', callin' me daddy
I'm 19 bitch, you know I don't got no kids
I'm out here thuggin' for real, you know how I live
Put dick in your mouth then put dick all in your ribs
Then leave your house, back to the money, you know what it is
I'm heartless, bitch you know how I feel
I'm really really really really really really really in the field
I'll never lie to you, on my soul I'll tell you what it is
Some day, one day me and bro 'nem gon' see a mil

[Chorus]
Come here girl, what's your name?
Do you wanna kick it with my gang?
Know you tired of fuckin' with them lames
Know you wanna rock a nigga's chain
Come here girl, who you is?
Know you wanna see just how I live
Know you wanna kick it in my crib
I'ma stick that dick all in your ribs
Come here girl
