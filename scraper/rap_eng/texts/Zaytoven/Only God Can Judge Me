[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
Only God can judge me (only God can judge)
Only God can judge me (only God can judge)
Only God can judge me (only God can judge)
Only God can judge me (only God can judge)
Made a plan, took a stand
They can judge if they want
I'm just sayin', I ain't playin'
I could flex but I don't
Only God can judge me (only God can judge)
I put God above me

[Verse 1]
Can't no one send me to heaven
Or send me to hell
They condemn but don't offend me
I'm still in his will
I know, my lane, stay low, no fame
I die, I gain, they laugh, my pain
I know these people gon' judge me
I know they look at me funny
They talk about me so ugly
But I'm still gon' keep it one hundred
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it all up
Tally up the total put it on us, on us
Let God be the judge
If you lyin' better run
Boy I ride with the Son
So I ain't worry about none
Well you better get up off me awfully
Saucy, this what daddy bought me
Bear your cross, don't cross me

[Chorus]
Only God can judge me (only God can judge)
Only God can judge me (only God can judge)
Only God can judge me (only God can judge)
Only God can judge me (only God can judge)
Made a plan, took a stand
They can judge if they want
I'm just sayin', I ain't playin'
I could flex but I don't
Only God can judge me (only God can judge)
I put God above me

[Verse 2]
I seen it all, people who want you to fall
Find everything you do wrong
What are you on?
Picking apart every song
Tell me what more do you want
I don't understand it, all this reprimanding
You come be my stand in
See if you can stand it
I don't really care if you judge me, don't love me
I don’t judge myself I leave that to the Lord above me
I talk, you listen
My point, you missed it
I’m on my mission
Don’t have to say it I live it
Don’t have to rap it I’m in it
You never hung with the tenants
Lived in the hood with the killas
I go to prison to witness
This my district I witness I live this
You don't even visit, why you in my business?

[Chorus]
Only God can judge me (only God can judge)
Only God can judge me (only God can judge)
Only God can judge me (only God can judge)
Only God can judge me (only God can judge)
Made a plan, took a stand
They can judge if they want
I'm just sayin', I ain't playin'
I could flex but I don't
Only God can judge me (only God can judge)
I put God above me
