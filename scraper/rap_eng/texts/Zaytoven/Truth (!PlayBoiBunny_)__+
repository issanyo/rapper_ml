[Intro: UnoTheActivist]
Hey man, listen up...
(Inaudible)
(Other producer tags)

[Chorus: UnoTheActivist]
I was showing love
Damn it, who I trust
Damn, my partner set me up
(What, what)
Pocket full of shame
Thought it was a dream
Everything you wouldn't see (?)
Thotty with the lean
I was finna go
I'll go for my bro
Eighteen years old
When my partner sold the soul
I can't sell my soul
Got that out the mud
But I know that's how it go
Still I never fall

[Verse 1:]
I might cash out too
Look at my chain right here
Look at my ring go blow
Woke up in the fudge
And it hold back down (?)
Walk up in the trap
Do not make a sound
Do my dough just like a hound
Dough just like a pound
Look, yeah, I remember breaking down
Breaking down the pound
Turn this shit right to an ounce
You should come look at me now
Talkin' bout hunnit thou
Damn it ,where my hunnit now
They be dissing me
'cause they missing me
I ain't getting lean
I was just trappin'
Chasing cheese, yeah
They gon' pray to me
If I come and guarantee, yeah
You need to understand
Nigga, it is you and me, yeah
Man was on the moon
That was on the tour (?)
So I pulled up on the dude
Show him not to [?]
Call me by surprise
Want me there to lie
Come, my pockets verified
I ain't got nothing to lose

[Chorus: UnoTheActivist]
I was showing love
Damn it, who I trust
Damn, my partner set me up
(What, what)
Pocket full of [?]
Thought it was a dream
Everything you wouldn't see (?)
Thotty with the lean
I was finna go
I'll go for my bro
Eighteen years old
When my partner sold the soul
I can't sell my soul
Got that out the mud
But I know that's how it go
Still I never fall
