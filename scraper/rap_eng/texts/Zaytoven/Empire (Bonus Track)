[Chorus]
I just finished my stock
Don't worry up Imma buy me a tool
Your bitch might for fuck me for fame
Suck me for fame
But I need some dollars
Life ain't easy lil homie
You owe me some money
I turn like Santana
Money, hoes, jewelry and clothes
In the kitchen man (bang)
(2x)

[Verse 1: MTLord]
My purpose is (?), you ain't buying a kilo don't knock at my door, get in the store, run in the store, miracle pull up lil nigga let's go
Turning this money my hand is so itchy
Jewelry, hoes, money and clothes
I want it all to (?) my bros
Shout out to 40, these niggas they with me
So they can go
Mama gotta pay them bills

[Chorus]
I just finished my stock
Don't worry up Imma buy me a tool
Your bitch might for fuck me for fame
Suck me for fame
But I need some dollars
Life ain't easy lil homie
You owe me some money

Money, hoes, jewelry and clothes
In the kitchen man (bang)
(2x)

In the trap for the guap

Don't worry up Imma buy me a tool
Your bitch might for fuck me for fame
Suck me for fame
But I need some dollars
Life ain't easy lil homie
You owe me some money
I turn like Santana
Money, hoes, jewelry and clothes
In the kitchen man (bang)
