[Intro]
(Zaytoven)
Burrr, burrr, burrr
1017, it's Guwop
Wizzop, Ziggy
Burrr, burrr, burrrr
I don't need nobody
A one man army
East Atlanta, it's Gucci

[Verse]
I don't need a wife, I need a freak (Woptober)
I don't wanna talk, I wanna speak (Woptober)
I don't need a drink, I need a blunt (Woptober)
And I don't want a day, I need a month (Woptober)
If this beef let's take it to the streets (Woptober)
I'm tryna make 2 million every week (Woptober)
I'm gettin' a lil more cocky every day (Woptober)
I don't wanna hear shit that these haters got to say (Woptober)
You gon' fuck around and end up in-deceased (Woptober)
Fuck all that politickin', this is not a speech (Woptober)
You wanna see me? That's gon' cost 200k (Woptober)
All you broke ass niggas please get out the way (Woptober)
Gucci Mane and I'm the man he wanna be (Woptober)
The only person that can defeat me is me (Woptober)
The only man that I'm competin' with is me (Woptober)
And I don't see these lil niggas, there's nothin' to see (Woptober)
