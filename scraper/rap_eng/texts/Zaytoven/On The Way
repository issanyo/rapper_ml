Told my family we got the blessing on the way
Told my stressing we got the blessing on the way

[Verse 1: Canton Jones]
I got blessings on the way
Trust I God I had to pray
Blessing every where
I don't need to pay
And I'm guessing on today
Well I can't exactly say
I just know it's coming soon
That's why I be making moves
It's necessary for my survival
Just need to function focusing on my survival
Blessings fall like apples
So remain humble
Grinding blessings changing
Like a fumble don't stumble
It's on the way
