[Hook]
She's shakin' ass, but that shit, it don't amaze me
I'm off the Act, this shit got me feelin' lazy
I was born in the 90s, fuck the 80s
Cause I've got lots of gwop, all these niggas hate me
Big shouts out to mama, she the one who made me (ey Lolo)
Big shouts out to grandmama, she the one who raised me
Them people made a star named Sosa, baby (Almighty)
I spend lots of gwop, thinkin' Morgan Tracy

[Verse 1]
I'm smokin' on this dope, this shit it got me high as fuck
You disrespect the Glo, you know we've gotta light you up
And all you hear is ambulances and them fire trucks
Thirty chop the car, do' that shit like regular
Coolin' with the stars, I ain't talkin' famous
I'mma break down this cigar, puff, puff, no passin'
They say I'm gettin' fat, bitch, that's what them bands did
They ain't see me, they see my car, and they say I'm handsome
I've got too much guap fallin' out my pants
These bitches in my hair, I'm too rich for some dandruff
I don't do the dash, bitch, I do the damn drift
These boys don't want no smoke, they don't want no cancer
Get 'em by the loads when I get them bands up
No, I ain't no brick, but I'm money dancin'
I like dirty Sprites and dirty Fantas
Get shot with this llama, I ain't talking Kendrick
