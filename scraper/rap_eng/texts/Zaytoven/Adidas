[Intro]
Adidas, Adidas, stripes all around me like I'm with the zebras
Haha
Uh
Time Alone 2 motherfucker
Y'all know I'm a fool with it

[Verse]
All these rappers are my children so I just got some new car seats
I'm an instrumental predator, somebody give me a hard beat
Chomping down on all em, they wanna put me on Shark Week
I pour lean then spark weed, I'm not a human, I'mma star breed
Uh
Born at the Witcher, but raised in the Den
My flow too cold like the winter in North
Michigan
Girl you know I get it in
If the feds around, I'm innocent
I hope you got a minute, sit
Young Stoney and Adida Gang, the whole crew be up in this bitch
If you hating, you can suck a dick
Man fuck all that talking bout what you gon do?
They said call the pussy out and shawty that's why I phoned you
Bet that I always go through
Kiss your neck and tell you that you are so cute
Adidas and Versace be the brands all on my body
It's still Mr. Pop That Pussy Like A Molly
And rappings not my hobby, it's just something that I do just like a genius
Dear God, I won't let the money get between us
Seeing my name in arenas
Y'all wanna talk down, y'all vag-eenas
Yes you are a pussycat
See a star falling and I put it back
I'm smoking good and feeling good in fact
I got your bitch just look at that
Me and LB cooking crack everytime we on the song
We kill, kill, kill, it man this murder is so wrong
We banging girls like a that stick you use to hit a gong
Eyes lower than the people's all the way in Hong Kong
You know we only smoke that strong
But you know it's only J's and when you looking at my shoes, all you see are A's
Adidas, Adidas, rappers be like "Bro my song is needing a feature."
But I've been seeing the future
Life is a bitch and we all gon' lose her
Mine gon' stick around cause I just got that girl a wedding ring
The fat lady was said to sing but all I see is blonde white girl who sound just like Alicia Keys
People pay me in respect but I'm the type to keep receipts
Like a map I need the streets
I eat the beats and give LBDOG whatever's left
You conversating like I give a fuck and you just wasting your breathe
My cologne cost more than all the clothes that you be rocking
Blowing on exotic kush, my dude is back from Austin
He sells it cheap to me cause I ain't never double crossed him
See I get this money and do it often
Work hard for everything I get and I get just what I earn
But you ain't Adida Gang, you none of my concern
