[Verse 1: Jacquees]
Girl I've been watchin' you all night
The way you break it down is what I like
If I got behind you would it be alright?
I'm just askin' cause I didn't come in here to fight
Aight cause I'm a playa, but I ain't playin' games
I'm askin' for ya age, ya number, and ya name
If ya got a boyfriend, hope he's not a hater
You should tell your girlfriends you will see them later
Come and dance wit' me shawty
Dance on me shawty
Break it, break it down and put your pants on me shawty
The way you do it, make me wanna put my hands on ya shawty
Don't be scared, we can act like this your birthday party
Go-go-go-go-go shawty it's your birthday
Oh, oh, oh girl you looking thirstay
And I want you in the worst way
Not myself, personal, I'm talkin' percy

Gotta keep it on the low, don't make it obvious
Slow it down boo we ain't in a rush
You move it any slower you gon' drive me nuts
I think that I'm in love with you but I can't tell you how
Maybe it's your swagger baby, baby it's your style
Don't know if it's your booty, maybe baby it's your smile
But it's somethin' 'bout you shawty got the whole party like wow
