[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus: Deitrick Haddon]
This is my Christmas prayer
Let love be in the air
Let the lonely know you care
This is my Christmas prayer
(My Christmas prayer, my Christmas prayer, my prayer)

[Verse 1: Deitrick Haddon]
Somebody needs your love
Feel like they're all alone
Saying they've had enough
And need help to carry the load
Yeah, so we're praying for those that don't have food to eat
Praying for the ones that don't have shoes on their feet
And wherever you are, just say this prayer with me

[Chorus: Deitrick Haddon]
This is my Christmas prayer
Let love be in the air (Oh Lord)
Let the lonely know you care
This is my Christmas prayer
(My Christmas prayer, my Christmas prayer, my my)

[Verse 2: Deitrick Haddon]
Oh Lord, I know you hear me when I pray
No, you don't take off on holidays
No, I'm not ashamed to call your name
You're the only one that can ease the pain
And I know it's Christmas but, oh, somebody needs your love
Somebody needs your love

[Chorus: Deitrick Haddon]
This is my Christmas prayer (My, my, my, my, my)
Let love be in the air (Let love be in the air)
Let the lonely know you care (Let the lonely know you care)
This is my Christmas prayer
(My Christmas prayer, my Christmas prayer, my prayer, oh)

[Outro: Deitrick Haddon & Olivia Dotson]
(My Christmas prayer)
Somebody really needs you, Lord (My Christmas prayer)
There's a girl (My Christmas prayer)
That need you, Lord (My Christmas prayer)
And thereâ€™s a boy (My Christmas prayer)
That needs you, yeah (My Christmas prayer)
My, my, my, my, my, my (My Christmas prayer, my Christmas prayer)
Dear Heavenly Father, I pray for all the kids that are unfortunate and all of the kids who don't have things
And I pray that you will just give them the heart to believe in you, Lord
In Jesus name I pray, amen
This is my Christmas prayer
Let love be in the air
Let the lonely know you care
This is my Christmas prayer
(My Christmas prayer, my prayer
My Christmas prayer, my prayer, oh)
