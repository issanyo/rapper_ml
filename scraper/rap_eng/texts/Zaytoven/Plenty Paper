[Hook: Key!]
Fuck jail, fuck twelve
Fuck the legislator, I got plenty paper
Got plenty paper, I got plenty paper
Got plenty paper, got plenty paper
Fuck jail, fuck twelve
Fuck the legislator, counting plenty paper
Counting plenty paper, counting plenty paper
Counting plenty paper, got plenty paper

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Young rich nigga having plenty paper
He's in the crib with a elevator
Trap house, Rich Gang terminator
Two Glock 9 like Tomb Raider
And I just came home fuck 12
Free all my niggas that locked in a cell
Fuck nigga wanna see me in jail
Was stuck on probation, I couldn't make bail
I'ma teach you how to whip and pull the camera out
One key in the kitchen at my grandma house
Bitch I been having like Skippa Da Flippa
Come to the safe house, I'm gonna remix ya
They keep talking 'bout lean, I sip it
Got way too many bitches, I'm pimping
Young nigga still living like Diddy
Fuck the judge, courthouse full of Bimmers

[Hook]
Fuck jail, fuck twelve
Fuck the legislator, I got plenty paper
Got plenty paper, I got plenty paper
Got plenty paper, got plenty paper
Fuck jail, fuck twelve
Fuck the legislator, counting plenty paper
Counting plenty paper, counting plenty paper
Counting plenty paper, got plenty paper

[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
Fuck twelve, free my nigga, no feds
I'm a real shooter, you might end up dead
Heavy artillery under my bed
Choppa got green dot the Vector got red
Jugg out the uber, like I was the driver
East coast lil baby, I bet I surprise her
Let that chopper sing like American Idol
Ask for forgiveness when I touch the Bible
Locked up with my niggas without no bar
I'm not always right but I know rights from wrong
Get to shivering when my dick touch my bitch tongue
The hip hop police chase me now that I'm on
Counting ten on an escalator, nigga getting hella paper
Never was a hater, chopper hit you like The Undertaker
Mad as a bitch as I sat in my cell
Pulled off in a Wraith when I got out of jail

[Hook]
Fuck jail, fuck twelve
Fuck the legislator, I got plenty paper
Got plenty paper, I got plenty paper
Got plenty paper, got plenty paper
Fuck jail, fuck twelve
Fuck the legislator, counting plenty paper
Counting plenty paper, counting plenty paper
Counting plenty paper, got plenty paper

[Verse 3: Key!]
APD got pressure
DPD got pressure
Young Key he got pressure
Call him if you need him
I just feel it in the air
I went to Saint Clair
I roll with Saint Clair
I'm finna drop a bag on her
Drop a bag on her
I'm in court counting up
Court counting up
I know they mad at us
Police be mad at us

[Hook]
Fuck jail, fuck twelve
Fuck the legislator, I got plenty paper
Got plenty paper, I got plenty paper
Got plenty paper, got plenty paper
Fuck jail, fuck twelve
Fuck the legislator, counting plenty paper
Counting plenty paper, counting plenty paper
Counting plenty paper, got plenty paper
