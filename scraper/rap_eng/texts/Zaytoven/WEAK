[Verse 1: Randy!]
Aye, Randy!
I need all eyes on me, Randy teased her (eyes, eyes, eyes)
I fucked my teacher underneath the bleachers
You think I give a fuck? You ain't check the sneakers
If this rap shit against the law, y'all misdemeanor (yeah, yeah)
Randy Obama, I just came in for the change (gwap, gwap, gwap)
Diamonds wetter than the bottom of a drain
I can see it on her face that she lyin', she got a mane (yeah bitch)
Bitch as golden as these Cartier frames
Randy Nothing Was the Same on a bitch
You drop names on ya bitch
Pop a xan and suck a dick, everyday ass bitch
Randy Hi-Tech, all y'all boys got a glitch
Got a house full of bricks, ain't no three lil' pigs

[Verse 2: Larry]
Packs doin' backflips, they some acrobats (flip, flip)
I had gave my bros a hundred, it was all I had (it was all I had)
Now I'm flexin' hardbody in this Range Rover (Range Rover)
Gassin', cashin' out the day's never over (no, no)
Tonight it's really goin' down, are you with it? (are you with it?)
I can't fuck around, I can't leave no witness (leave no witness)
Ride or die, no I can't wait 'til you finish ('til you finish)
Y-3 Bodysuit like I'm going swimmin' (like I'm going swimmin')
They throwin' money in my lap when I'm chillin' (damn)
You just got put on game, that's why y'all my children (ha ha)
And if you want to count the stack you need some rhythm (need some rhythm)
You can't be stuntin' like I'm stuntin' with no vision (with no vision)

[Hook: Larry]

[Verse 3: SenseiATL]
Runnin' up a check that's a money marathon (that's a money marathon)
Shaded in designer this the dawn of the don (this the dawn of the don)
Boastin' to the set, that might get you setup (pussy)
You bitches lookin' sick, need to get they check up (pussy)
Got a big bag, fifty racks in the duffle (racks)
Knockin' down the door, now they can't knock my hussle (nah)
Respect me off the muscle 'cause im flexin' in my town (check)
Always goin' up so you know we shut it down (shut it down
