Intro:
Just gimme some time to gather my thoughts (gather my thoughts)
Gather my thoughts (gather my thoughts)
Ye ye, Just gimme some time to gather my thoughts (gather my thoughts)
Gather my thoughts (gather my thoughts)
Gather my thoughts (gather my thoughts)
Ye ye

Hook:
I just wanna be famous, I'm just really trynna stunt on you
Knowing you'll appreciate it, showboating like Knievel do
And I wanna get paid for it, street performers know a thing or two
Talent always gets wasted, that's just something that the people do
People do, that's just something that the people do
And I wanna get paid for it, God knows I was made for it
Talent always gets wasted (lord knows)
I just wanna be famous

Verse 1:
Like a contemplating pimp, let me gather my thoughts (ye ye)
Why you say you're flexing on IG, you're not
Where's the receipts? Personally, I think you're a fraud
Desperate for attention that's you paid for some bots oh!
I would never do that I build a foundation naturally
Digging through my resume they could see that it's actually
People keep telling me what I'm chasing is a fantasy so they don't believe, what a calamity (oh dang!)

Bridge:
I just wanna be famous
I just really trynna stunt on you (like Knievel do)
Knowing you'll appreciate it
Showboating like Knievel do (you already know)

Verse 2:
These people always bragging
Talking bout that they making moves
People always rapping
Talking bout what they gone do
But these people slacking
You could tell in what they do
People fake they acting
That's just something that the people do
People do, IDC cuz this not for you
Got a whip and it's fountain blue you commercialized like mountain dew
I stay real like Jidenna do
Slim shady do
Like Russ G-Eazy J.Cole do, YG do
King Lil G & Nipsey too!

Outro:
