[Chorus]
I fuck her then I dip (gone)
Jump back in my whip (yup)
I'm straight out the block (block)
Hollows in my Glock (yeah)
Bitch I'm my own boss (it's Dolph)
It's money when I talk (it's Dolph)
Spent a mil on ice just to get my point across
I fuck her then I dip (yeah)
Jump back in my whip (yeah)
I'm straight out the block (block)
Hollows in my Glock (uh)
Bitch I'm my own boss (yeah)
It's money when I talk (yeah)
Spent a mil on ice just to get my point across

[Verse 1]
Hah, ayy, I ain't never know how to do shit but go and get it
This ain't even all my jewelry, I got on two fifty, ayy
Never signed a deal but he spending all these mils
Bitch stay out my business, have a drink, bitch chill
You didn't grow up where I did, you can't feel how I feel
That shit ain't 'bout money, I put my brakes on it and yield
I stood that bitch up for two months and she blowin' me up still
This shit just got real, I'm the shit like diarrhea
A hundred racks on me, all hundred dollar bills
I keep lean to pour up, bitch my plug Doctor Phil
I take her to the mall and let her glow up in Chanel

[Chorus]
I fuck her then I dip (gone)
Jump back in my whip (yup)
I'm straight out the block (block)
Hollows in my Glock (yeah)
Bitch I'm my own boss (it's Dolph)
It's money when I talk (it's Dolph)
Spent a mil on ice just to get my point across
I fuck her then I dip (yeah)
Jump back in my whip (yeah)
I'm straight out the block (block)
Hollows in my Glock (uh)
Bitch I'm my own boss (yeah)
It's money when I talk (yeah)
Spent a mil on ice just to get my point across

[Verse 2]
For real though
Ayy, niggas act like bitches and it ain't no excuse for it
Some of my niggas Pyru and some of my niggas rollin'
This bankroll I can't fold it, choppers we still toting
Smoke a lot of dope, you can call me Dopey
Rock a lot of gold, you can call me Goldie
Got a couple Pateks, and a couple Rollies
Went to LA just to ball, you can call me Kobe
You all about these bitches, I'm all about this paper
Bumped in Farrakhan, told him As-Salaam-Alaikum
Buy foreign cars and take 'em to the hood and drag race 'em
Package got caught up, I made her call in and trace 'em, yeah

[Chorus]
I fuck her then I dip (gone)
Jump back in my whip (yup)
I'm straight out the block (block)
Hollows in my Glock (yeah)
Bitch I'm my own boss (it's Dolph)
It's money when I talk (it's Dolph)
Spent a mil on ice just to get my point across
I fuck her then I dip (yeah)
Jump back in my whip (yeah)
I'm straight out the block (block)
Hollows in my Glock (uh)
Bitch I'm my own boss (yeah)
It's money when I talk (yeah)
Spent a mil on ice just to get my point across
