[Verse 1]
Brand new money, brand new house
A little extra show money dough bought the loft
My bitch big ol' ass the only thing soft
Bin osama with burglary because I never got caught
Come my shows my money you in the creep no Dawson
I can spit 3:16 like Steve Austin
Throwing up big Bs like I play for Boston
Smoke more weed than a hippy and it cost me
A whole lot of money but Chiefin I cannot stop it
A lot of niggas funny and beefing bout these thot bitches
My Spanish bitch she talk a lil English so yes she got it
Free Bobby Shmurda last week I caught a body
Told that bitch to get on top and ride like a Ducati
Pit them on blast and let them know a nigga copy
I love my head sloppy, shawty like to party
The monster come out of her when she on them narcotics
Shawty had no neck so I had to let Shiy hit
It's all about respect Aretha Franklin to disregard this
Im sorry, sorry, sorry
I'm sorry, promise baby it'll never happen again, I'm sorry
I've been on the road got no time to spend but I'm sorry
I swear to God that I'll never do it again girl I'm sorry
I'm on my knees right now asking you to accept my apology

[jkeem: Talking]
Aye look man, I apologise
So right now what I want you to do is
Just hear me out
Please. Listen

[Verse 2]
Sorry for them times that I cheated
And I'm, sorry for them times I weren't there when you needed me
Sorry for the times I neglect you
But I didn't wanna hurt your feelings no you were the reason
I kept you locked down like I'm defence
I was selfish didn't want nobody else to see ya
Bout her a ring and she was speechless
Told her if we break up she can still keep it
Even though she got that wet I still leave her
Better yet water, should have named her Fiji
R.I.P Mario  I know this not no game but I might throw that green like my middle name Luigi
The objective of the day to be real I'm the motherfucking teacher
Mmm, shut down the mall every city  I go make sure security beefed up
Better join us can't beat us
It ain't over 'til the fat lady sing
Plus I'm hard to get off like a fat lady ring
How you a big dog when a cat make you scream?
I be calling calls like a new Jack city
Call me nino brown I am new Jack city
Ask your friend i was in that new black Bentley
Pilgrim fresh like everyday Thanksgiving
Niggas  think I am rich as fuck cos I'm living
Yeah I got a lil money tryna get close to a billion
Fuck up my first onion then started breaking in buildings
Came home with a 50 told mama imma get it just believe in my, I
Got something to do, got something to prove
I swear that god that I, am gon' be the best and do whatever it takes
I swear to god my nigga that I, I, I
I swear to god my nigga that I, I, I am jkeem baby..
