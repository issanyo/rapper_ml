[Verse 1: Oscuro]
Versace Versace my wardrobe Italian like that shit Fran Totti
Aesthetic Era there’s me and There’s aziz there’s nobody nearer
Snorting snow like I’m finnish , Find a sextape of your bitch and I’m probably in it
Sharing my STDS like they only gone viral, your bae prefers me man Drop the denial
This coming together all arranged like a married Iranian
Still unemployed, VOTE U-Kip and Fuck the Romanians
See me walking head down all deep in anger but I’m DM’ing your girl getting ready to bang her
Shout out to seabiscuit and the Chinchilla, lay a hand on my girls I’ll do 20 for Killer
What are the fuck are you Talking About
Versace Versace Getting expelled from Hills for socking a machete, moving on so holla for KETTY
Feeling home back in endz when I’m shotting me baccie, comfort comes first all ADIDAS trackies
These bitches will holla for Ozzie H- Waller, dropped the fake fucking act learnt the way of the shotter
Kidnapping your girl have her gone til November, Oscuro Boy That’s the name to remember

[Verse 2: YUNG MOALG]
Versace versace I'm going to Zi's and your bitch looking at me
I open the doors to maserati and she just jump right on top of me
I stacking this paper and ya'll can hate later or fuck right away from me
See me at DW get shredded and I'm taking my bitch to zi's
My swag is contagious and that's why fuck boys gotta be taken it
I do not fuck with Hype beasts so you can jump right away from it
Shout out to my Bengali's for keeping it real and keeping it optimist
If you hating then you better go and check with your optimitrist
Vision express deliver this pain from door to door
And I'm killing the game straight to the core
The police know it's illegal I can't fuck with the law
This shit getting gruesome like I'm starrin in saw
No horror film fake I'm real you count on it
Number one shotta in Cambridge licking your girls tit
I go to Algeria and they know what the kid's name is
Rule number one ain't got time for no fucking snake Diss
If it comes to beef I won't back away from a fights
Shout out to Steamy J for keeping it this hip hop alive
I trap underground like im Chilean
I call your bitch a dragon, because that girl I'm slaying
