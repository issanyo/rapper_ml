[Chorus: OJ da Juiceman]
China white, fishscale, heavy on the clientele
Grams on the digi scale, weigh a fish just like a whale
China white, china white, fishscale, fishscale
China white, china white, fishscale, fishscale
China white, fishscale, heavy on the clientele
Grams on the digi scale, weigh a fish just like a whale
China white, china white, fishscale, fishscale
China white, china white, fishscale, fishscale

[Verse 1: OJ da Juiceman]
Jackie Chan bricks, karate choppin' fish (yes sir)
Skrrt, skrrt, in the pot, white same color grits (bricks)
Had to use my wrist, had to take a risk (uh)
Had to cook up bricks, now a nigga rich (uh)
[Lays, I want some chills?], Glock on my hip (uh)
Extension come equipped (uh), extension come equipped (uh)
Nemo, Nemo, I just found Dory
Came up out them 'partments, it's a true story
Boomin', boomin', my trap house stupid
In and out, in and out, swing my door with a uzi
Clip so long, bruh, I could shoot a movie
Glock got a kickstand, clip look like a ruler

[Chorus: OJ da Juiceman]
China white, fishscale, heavy on the clientele
Grams on the digi scale, weigh a fish just like a whale
China white, china white, fishscale, fishscale
China white, china white, fishscale, fishscale
China white, fishscale, heavy on the clientele
Grams on the digi scale, weigh a fish just like a whale
China white, china white, fishscale, fishscale
China white, china white, fishscale, fishscale

[Verse 2]
I get the jig in the jigga, I get to cookin' the cook up
Soon as the pack touch down, I go straight to the hood with it
I do not sweat over ho, I only sweat on the stove
I'm rockin' diamonds and gold, I got a diamond [?]
You were the nigga that pickin' up, I was the nigga that droppin' off
You were the nigga that hate on us, get with them hoes and you drop salt
See where you at when it pop off, shit get real no shit talk
Choppa gon' knock your sock off, nigga can't even get rock off
Sit down and talk to the big boss, I make it jump like I'm Kriss Kross
Your hoes gon' holla like hit dog, I hit the 'bama get bricks off
I even invest in a white broad, I even got me a white dog
Even gon' sleep in the White House, sleep with your bitch with the lights off

[Chorus: OJ da Juiceman]
China white, fishscale, heavy on the clientele
Grams on the digi scale, weigh a fish just like a whale
China white, china white, fishscale, fishscale
China white, china white, fishscale, fishscale
China white, fishscale, heavy on the clientele
Grams on the digi scale, weigh a fish just like a whale
China white, china white, fishscale, fishscale
China white, china white, fishscale, fishscale
