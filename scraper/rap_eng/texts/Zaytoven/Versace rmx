[Verse 1-CRYM]

Versace versace, magic my wand bitches call me Hitachi
On a roll like Unagi all over your bitch like Roberto Cavalli
Stuck in the underground, guess I might be better off blowing up in Benghazi
Turn on toonami give your girl salami and boy she was wet like Dasani
Versace versace, I beat it like Rocky then cop a Pagani
These hoes walk around like some zombies like where the Armani where the Abercromie?
You sweet as agave I'm making tequila then driving your rented Bugatti
Fuck all em charges I leave you to play with the Phish call you Trey Anastasi
Versace versace your time on the scene'll be short as a jockey
They be like golly the flow is so godly now why would you think I was cocky
Me and my posse don't tolerate singing to popo like a mariachi
You gon be sorry you came here not holding a tommy now I got a body
Medusa medusa you got em all hard like a rock for the brand
Blowing a grand on the same shit that he got now that I just don't understand
Toting that blam for the cam take it back to the pawn shop and throw up your hands
Oh I'm so bad I should be hitting for cobra command
Medusa Medusa, I'm killing palookas, a routine I'm used to
Trapping all day and when I take a nap on the way I might wake up the rooster
Versace versace karate courtesy of the yakuza
Versace abuser you losers don't know I'm a master of the kama sutra
Versace Bugatti Hublot Audemars like a broken ass record
Now everybody's all gucci and louis and when its the norm then it ain't really flexing
I'm rocking some shit from the internet and I got all of you checking
Chitown bred MTL posted up no disrespecting
Versace versace Zaytoven done cooked up a good one for Migos
But what he didn't expect was the best remix yet to be coming from me though

Versace...
