[Verse]
This shit dead, rock and roll to this beat
ESPN, sold my soul to the streets
Caught some beef, that shit over with me
I'm with 6 Block, I got my soldiers with me
Dip and dab, nigga crab, I stay in the lab
Skinny nigga, I stay flexin', I don't got no abs
My ex she asked me why but I don't do the math
I'm wildin' hard, swear to God just took a bleach bath
Ayy, I just took a bleach bath
Finger jerkin', head hurtin', up that forty cal
And I been catching bodies, that shit out of style
Went to fighting in that schoolhouse, now we shootin' out
Hah, and we up, them niggas losin' now
Boy you pussy on your period, I see your coochie now
Boy you pussy on your period, brought some panties out
Broad day or broad night, we can shoot it out
Hundred more shots out my drum, makin' all the pussy niggas run
Put a pussy nigga in the trunk, leave the boy ass in the dump
Young nigga raised in the slum, we was just poor like a bum
Gucci gang like Lil Pump, AK it come with a drum
I'm rollin', I'm rollin', I'm stickin', but I'm just keepin' my distance
Forty it come with extension, guarantee that I'm not missin'
I ain't leavin' no witness, boy that shit there with the children
Get it and stack up the millions, boy my new bitch she Brazilian
Ten K's, ten days, ten plays
This beat not from Metro, it's from A-Zay
'Cause Lil 6 out that cut, I go crazy
'Bout them bricks, knock 'em off, Craig on Friday
Hah, and it's my way or the highway
Balenciagas with that Prada, it's a fly day
My plug Italian and he be serving that gourmet
Mall nineteen, 2015, rest up Kendre
Ridin' 'round town with a Ruger, bitch I just hopped out an Uber
Ayy, Kojak my cousin a shooter, pray that y'all win, hallelujah
Young nigga suited and booted, bitch I just fucked me a cougar
'Member we used to eat noodles, now Zay got me on tour

[Outro]
Ayy this shit right here, this shit just the intro
6toven the mixtape, just stay tuned
From trapstars to black cars, hah
