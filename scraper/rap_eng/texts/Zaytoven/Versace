[Intro]
I don't give a fuck about the quality of this beat
I just want to spit some bars
One Verse Killa still in!

[Verse]
Versace, Versace, medusa head on
Like I'm Illuminati (aye)
Fuck you expecting from me?
Motherfucker, I need your Bugatti (aye)
I'm running out of my time
Need to hurry my bitch and my buddy (aye)
We need to rip up the muh'fuckin' stage
In some brand new Versace (aye)
I don't know what the fuck happened to rap
Everyone is so grimy (aye, aye)
Niggas just want controversy
They diss me for lyrics I'm writing (aye)
I think it's because every kid
That can rhyme in the rhythm gon' hype it (aye)
But please don't wake up killer sleeping in me
He will tear you, I promise (aye)
Versace, Versace, I was underground
And lived in bando houses
Now I do chase the paper all day
Like my nigga Dan Houser (aye)
This is my own GTA:
Gangster, tricky and muh'fuckin' asshole (aye)
I'm tryna get Laura Vandervoort baby
And no one can stop me (aye)
Boy, fuck all the Grammys and charts
I don't need this shit, I want the money (aye)
10k every day, and now
I can afford me to buy new Versace (aye)
My watch cost a car, and my car
Cost a muh'fuckin' house in the Holly (aye)
But I live in the basement
Just because I'm tired of this paparazzi (aye)
Sorry for accent, it's only because
I'm from Russia, I'm proud of it (aye, aye)
Been hating on my own country
Let's go fucking blame me about it (yeah, yeah)
Used to be a real fucker
I will drop no responsibility (aye)
I'm raising my town and I'll raise
My damn country to real prosperity (fuck that shit)
Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace (aye)
The verse almost over
Now I can see your momma shaking her body (aye)
Rippin' the beats every time
That I get to the mic, I'm on top of it (aye)
Now I go steal a fan from your base
And you gon' lose your audience (ooh)

[Outro]
Oh, shit
I killed it
I guess, haha
Fuck that shit, let's go
One Verse Killa in this motherfucker
Yeeeee-ARGH!
