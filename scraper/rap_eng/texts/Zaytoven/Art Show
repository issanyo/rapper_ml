[Intro]
Zaytoven
Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat

[Verse 1]
Damn my neck clearer than water
Old heads go hide all your daughters
Boat cannot be the father
I used a condom, I did
Baby said swallow my kid
I cannot front on a bitch

[Chorus]
I cannot front on a nigga, I cannot front on a bitch now
I don't eat vegetables but I keep carats in my wrist now
Fly like a cardinal, brother keep all of the arsenal
And I paint all of these bitches' faces just like an art show
Ayy, just like an art show
Nut on her face, paint up her face, just like an art show
Woah, just like an art show
Call it the art show, bitch it's the art show

[Verse 2]
Hmm, bitch fuck your daddy he don't want you with a boss
I met your mama and she hated how I floss
She said my style reminded her of Kriss Kross
She said I need to walk around with a cross
I can't have love for no bitch (no)
Watch how I lane switch (yeah)
Watch how I flood the wrist, oh
Damn, that's a flood (that's a flood)
Put that on the hood (put that on the hood)
I'm living good (yeah yeah)

[Chorus]
I cannot front on a nigga, I cannot front on a bitch now
I don't eat vegetables but I keep carats in my wrist now
Fly like a cardinal, brother keep all of the arsenal
And I paint all of these bitches' faces just like an art show
Ayy, just like an art show
Nut on her face, paint up her face, just like an art show
Woah, just like an art show
Call it the art show, bitch it's the art show

[Verse 3]
Nigga you can never compare me to you (bitch, Lil Boat)
Shabazz on the six, my nigga what it do (my nigga Shabazz, Shabazz)
Shouts out SK-Tebo and the whole crew (SK-Tebo)
Looking at my wrist and caught the whole flu
Niggas be hyping over the namebrand
Niggas be spending they guap with no gameplan
Niggas been rapping for years and still don't got no fans
Niggas talk down on Boat, they pull up in black vans

[Chorus]
I cannot front on a nigga, I cannot front on a bitch now
I don't eat vegetables but I keep carats in my wrist now
Fly like a cardinal, brother keep all of the arsenal
And I paint all of these bitches' faces just like an art show
Ayy, just like an art show
Nut on her face, paint up her face, just like an art show
Woah, just like an art show
Call it the art show, bitch it's the art show
