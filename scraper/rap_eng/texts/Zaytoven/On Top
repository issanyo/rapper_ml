[Hook]
Me and my niggas on top, me and my niggas on top
Me and my niggas on top, me and my niggas on top
Me and my niggas on top, if you get to the guap
Young nigga, pull out your knot, pull out your knot

Pull out your knot, pull out your knot
Pull out your knot, pull out your knot
Pull out your knot, me and my niggas on top
Nothin' but me and my niggas on top
Nothin' but me and my niggas on top

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Me and my niggas on top like the pyramid
Smokin' on cookie, that gas, came a long way from that mid
My niggas pull up wit' that mask, forgive me for the dirt they did
Now we on top of the mountain, no candy-countin' up the M&Ms
Kickin', pimpin', drippin' sauce in Givenchy
Livin' in a mansion, my neighbor Diddy
Pull up in a Lambo, tell your ho get in
I hit the gas right before she put her foot it
Plug call my phone said he got Cuba Goodin'
I keep a tight circle, you niggas can't fit in
I might put a trap in the Holiday Inn
Free the squad, let 'em out of the pen'

[Hook: Quavo]
Me and my niggas on top, me and my niggas on top
Me and my niggas on top, me and my niggas on top
Me and my niggas on top, if you get to the guap
Young nigga, pull out your knot, pull out your knot

Pull out your knot, pull out your knot
Pull out your knot, pull out your knot
Pull out your knot, me and my niggas on top
Nothin' but me and my niggas on top
Nothin' but me and my niggas on top


[Verse 2: Sauce Walka]
Me and my niggas on top, got a bitch countin' that guap
I bought the Benz off the lot, smelling like weed, fuck the cops
Yeah, that's the one you ain't got
Yeah, that's the one you ain't got
Dummy, don't ask how I bought it
Nigga, you know it came off from the twat, damn
Sauce Gotti, I'm a P, send them bitches in the streets
Break her for a hundred Gs, she gon' pray to me
I'm a saint, Saucellujah, I'll send my angels to you
But they ain't comin' wit' a blessin'
They gon' send the motherfuckin' choppers through you
So please don't disrespect the pimpin'
Sauce Twinz still drippin', Sosamann, throw the alley-oop
I'm a dunk the bitch, Blake Drippin'
Yeah, you know we win the game, Sauce Twinz in the Range
Nah, fuck the Range, I meant the Phantom
Drippin' wit' the Migos in Atlanta

[Hook: Quavo]
Me and my niggas on top, me and my niggas on top
Me and my niggas on top, me and my niggas on top
Me and my niggas on top, if you get to the guap
Young nigga, pull out your knot, pull out your knot

Pull out your knot, pull out your knot
Pull out your knot, pull out your knot
Pull out your knot, me and my niggas on top
Nothin' but me and my niggas on top
Nothin' but me and my niggas on top


[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Me and my niggas on top like the Eiffel Tower
Diamonds surfin' like Rocket Power
Pull up in the Audi, I'm Master P 'bout it
Take a nigga off and don't think about it
Swervin' in the Kawasaki or a Bugatti
Cause Giordani got the Miley Cyrus
I'm drippin', spillin' sauce, no teryaki
Watch the trap with one eye, no Illuminati
I'm on top of the mountain in Louboutins
They bitin' the swag, call 'em Chico, they chewin' it
Sippin' on Actavis, slowly movin'
Got two bad bitches in a jacuzzi
Your bitch gave me brain like she was a computer
She asked for Timberlands, I had to boot her
So much gold, I feel like Slick Rick the Ruler
They said we had cocaina on our tour bus

[Hook: Quavo]
Me and my niggas on top, me and my niggas on top
Me and my niggas on top, me and my niggas on top
Me and my niggas on top, if you get to the guap
Young nigga, pull out your knot, pull out your knot

Pull out your knot, pull out your knot
Pull out your knot, pull out your knot
Pull out your knot, me and my niggas on top
Nothin' but me and my niggas on top
Nothin' but me and my niggas on top


[Verse 4: Sosamann]
Big Sos kickin' major flavor
They say the Sauce is headin' to the top
Backwood full of bumbaclot
Little nigga, where your fuckin' knot?
You don't have it? Ha-ha, boy, you got me laughin'
Sos spit like a fuckin' dragon
How it happen', all of the splashin'?
I remember, I was fuckin' trappin'
In the 3, I was sellin' butter
Sauce Gotti, that's my fuckin' brudda
Twin, nigga, with the tree-cutter
Hell no, I ain't never love her
Sosamann gon' break her, break her
Don't play no games like a fuckin' Sega
Don't want the problem, she just want the flavor

[Hook: Quavo]
Me and my niggas on top, me and my niggas on top
Me and my niggas on top, me and my niggas on top
Me and my niggas on top, if you get to the guap
Young nigga, pull out your knot, pull out your knot

Pull out your knot, pull out your knot
Pull out your knot, pull out your knot
Pull out your knot, me and my niggas on top
Nothin' but me and my niggas on top
Nothin' but me and my niggas on top
