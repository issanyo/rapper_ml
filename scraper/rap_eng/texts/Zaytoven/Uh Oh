[Intro]
Got a big Glock, hah, 6
I just freestyled this whole song, no written
If you ain't from the 6, nigga kick rocks
Bad ass jit from the 6 playin' nick-nock
Uh-oh, ready to roll

[Chorus]
Boy if you ain't from the 6, nigga kick rocks
Bad ass jit from the 6 playin' nick-nock
Uh-oh, I just got me a big Glock
Whippin' in the kitchen, got a nigga whole wrist locked
Uh-oh, I just touched down, Julio
Steppin' on the scene, I'm so clean, there go Foolio
Every day of my life be a movie though
Got your main ho and we just got groovy though

[Verse 1]
Oh, I just bought another stolen car
TDB, Lil 6, they know who we are
Skrrt skrrt, pull up in the foreign car
Real gas, ninety-three, it's in the jar
Knock knock, I just caught another pop
Pop pop, we just caught another opp, ooh
Man down, man I know that nigga dropped
Like Fathers Day, you know that we gon' pop
Pull up in the rental, niggas sentimental
When we kill your ass it's not accidental
Pull up on your block, bust shit like a pimple
Put a hole in his face like a dimple

[Chorus]
Boy if you ain't from the 6, nigga kick rocks
Bad ass jit from the 6 playin' nick-nock
Uh-oh, I just got me a big Glock
Whippin' in the kitchen, got a nigga whole wrist locked
Uh-oh, I just touched down, Julio
Steppin' on the scene, I'm so clean, there go Foolio
Every day of my life be a movie though
Got your main ho and we just got groovy though

[Verse 2]
She wanna go half on a baby
Bitch I'm blowin' up, lil bitch is you crazy?
Poppin' percocets, that shit got me lazy
Draco in the cut just like Molly Brazy
I'm blowin' up, I know these niggas hate it
My own homie hatin', wanna take me
My grandma and my auntie, they some Haitians
And if I want that voodoo they'll make it

[Chorus]
Boy if you ain't from the 6, nigga kick rocks
Bad ass jit from the 6 playin' nick-nock
Uh-oh, I just got me a big Glock
Whippin' in the kitchen, got a nigga whole wrist locked
Uh-oh, I just touched down, Julio
Steppin' on the scene, I'm so clean, there go Foolio
Every day of my life be a movie though
Got your main ho and we just got groovy though
