[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Multi Multi Multi, yes I'm Mr. Black Amigo
Coca Coca Coca cheap, prices on the kilos
Me and my partner Chico used to sleep in them abandos
All white squares, now we get em by the hundos
Scooter met Hector and he made the world respect me
Oh no Chee Chee Chee, hell no he ain't gonna fuck the street
Used to live by the candy lady on a small street
Jugged my money up and bought a house next to Gucci's

[Hook: Quavo]
