[Verse 1]
I got a list on my mind, the shit you can't put your hands on
My bitch or my money, get your sneaky ass cap blown
Been about mine since a nigga first rap song
Hood ass nigga, white neighbors, I ain't got a favourite
How you living nigga
Money ain't a object, take a picture nigga
Matter a fact, give me to your bitch, I'm a favourite nigga
Matter a fact, you should check, that's really your baby nigga?
Making pussy famous, that's what I do
Call me Hugh
I been blowing loud, dropping everything foreign
Spend a hunnid on a car cause yesterday was boring
I got Rollie after Rollie so your time ain't shit
If I'm smoking, you ain't rolling cause your grind ain't shit

[Hook]
You can't touch it
You can't touch this shit

My bitch, you can't touch this shit
My Rollie, you can't touch this shit
My money, you can't touch this shit
My Rari, you can't touch this shit
You can't touch it
You can't touch this shit
You can't touch this

[Verse 2]
TMZ on my ass got me coming out the club
With somebody else bitch, he the nigga that doesn't love
I ain't got a problem, I'm a player, ain't no crime bruh
She just suck my dick, hell yeah let her swallow bruh
I'm just icy as fuck, I'm colder than refrigerator
Hood icon, hood politican, trap Obama
You don't want no drama with Memphis nigga
Find you about this chicken nigga
Yo body for crispy for fucking with me nigga
Niggas hating on my come up cause they never made it
You would never be a boss cause I done set you with the table
700 horses, le Ferrari, I just bought a stable
Instagramming, catch you hating, get you shot from every angle nigga
