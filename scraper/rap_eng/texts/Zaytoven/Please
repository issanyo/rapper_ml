You don't want work for me
Got something for that ass boy
Think ya work for free
I got pounds and bags with that cash boy
You ain't my cup of tea
I got pounds of that boof batch
Trash bags zipped down to my last boy
Instagram this weed (All dis weed! Lean!)
I just sold 3 Qp's
I need four whole oz's
When im sippin that lean (dat LEAAN!)
An im smokin Irene, if ya know what I mean
Its yung gleesh, yung gleetchie
An I fuck wit BD's
Im from DC , but shouts out pee wee
Im from northeast? but I fuck wit GD's

[HOOK]

Nigga, pleaaasee
Serve me some lean (dat leaaan! Ayeee!)
Pleaaasee! I need some leaaan
Pleaaasee! serve me some weed! (AHHHH!)
Pleaaaseee! im so gleetchie
Its like pleaaaseee! Serve me some lean!


[2nd Verse]
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up
Turn up it all gon' turn up
Yung gleesh gon get burnt up

And i serve that boof bag plus i got it gook'd up
Serving drugs ya time got looked up
