My grandaddy died and fucked up the family (Damn)
Dear God, I need to talk to OG D (Please)

But I know Pac laughed (Hahaha)
I wish I could bring Aaliyah back (Bring Aaliyah back)
I'd let her sing on all these dope boy's track (Young Scooter)
So caught up in the streets I didn't know God's prayer
Ain't went to church in fifteen years, ma was mad as hell (True story)
And when I fly to do a show, she be scared as hell
You niggas try to count me out, but I'm still here (Young Scooter)
