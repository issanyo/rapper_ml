Hook:
Rap game fake, I don't see no competition
I feel right now, I'm the realest nigga in it
Rap game fake, I don't see no competition
I feel right now, I'm the realest nigga in it
Still standing in the kitchen
Me and these white bitches
Soon as I take your other whip
The hoes in position
Just think before you snitch
You gotta make the right decision
You can't be no boss if you can't play that position

Rockin' like the street game
We contract just like cocaine
Until we wait to the whole thing
Your album may do nothing
We payin as my phone ring
You know I did my own thing
The rap game like the dope game
The streets is where I ..
And king hustle, lean, stay down and finally
Rich, the label silent is for hell for bridge
You look better niggas ain't shit
Let's go!

[Hook:]

Bossman your position, and you ain't gotta check it
I make my own birds when I don't wanna serve you nigga
Why you in my kitchen if you ain't got nothing with you
Let niggas in your kitchen and some shit gonna come up missin'
Dope game ain't for free, is no finessing street
I'll rap when I drop, but I don't rap for free
See I'm my own boss, I had beside me
The two house working, labels can't find me

Hook:
Rap game fake, I don't see no competition
I feel runner, I'm the realest nigga in it
Rap game fake, I don't see no competition
I feel runner, I'm the realest nigga in it
Still standing in the kitchen
Me any white bitches
Soon as I take your other whip
The hoes in position
Just think before you snitch
You gotta make the right decision
You can't be no boss if you can't play that position

Bust a brick down
Nigga have you ever sold a pound?
But that's the shit you rap about
Nigga where the fuck you talk, .. 'bout
Rap game fake, so I say what I say
Your name no hold no way
And you can't say what I say
Got kush, got swag ..
You got caught up yesterday
Nigga how you act today
These niggas snitchin' every day
