[Hook: Young Dolph]
Never take a bitch where you stay
Never keep work where you lay
I woke up this morning said fuck it might go cop another coupe today
Sipping on that UGK
My spot stay open its never too late
Never with my family starve
Cuz never will I not hustle hard
Never (x12)

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Never keep work where you lay
Never take a bitch where you stay
Never show a nigga where your stash at
Cuz thats gon' be the same nigga you blast at
Never put shit past none of these hoes cuz all of these hoes straight ratchet
All of this hustling shit I got this from my daddy
Vegetarian selling nothing but pounds of collard green and cabbage
My trap booming, your bitch working
Up a half a ticket and I'm still serving
Legend in the trap like Julius Erving
James Worthy, I don't trust these bitches cuz they ain't worthy
I don't like triffling hoes cuz they make me nervous
I don't fuck with broke boys cuz I think I'm allergic
Aachoo god bless me
Sipping on Actavis, eating fettucine
I told these niggas(X4)
That they could never be me
My nigga gotta do this shit for real
I stash 60 p's of strong in your bitch crib

[Hook]
Never take a bitch where you stay
Never keep work where you lay
I woke up this morning said fuck it might go cop another coupe today
Sipping on that UGK
My spot stay open its never too late
Never with my family starve
Cuz never will I not hustle hard
Never (x12)

[Verse 2: Trae The Truth]
Never fuck with fuck niggas who outta line
If they don’t want the business I tell em stay out of mine
My nigga got a quarter hoe niggas was droppin' dimes
How these niggas see him they silent without a spine
Never fuck with niggas that gossip
Never fuck with niggas who hate
Never fuck with niggas who pretend they only tryin' to steal off yo plate
Pussy niggas fake trying to make somethin' shake
But I’d rather hit they face and try make somethin' break
Run off in this, get to dropping, try to make somethin' skate
20 birds in the trunk, talking helluva weight
36 come short im talking helluva wait
I’m in the bitch by tint low glass
In the hood Truth hustling his ass off
Turnt up ain’t no way to cut this cash off
Quarter mill yeah I spent it on my last house
I tell a bitch I don’t love shit fuck somethin'
Run off in this get lost then duck somethin'
Ho niggas too foul might punch somethin'
I ain't feelin what they talking I’m a buck something
I don’t trust nothing everythang shady
People set you up, might be yo ole lady
Low right hand man try to play gravy
They on my radar but fuck ‘em it I’m a play crazy

[Hook]
Never take a bitch where you stay
Never keep work where you lay
I woke up this morning said fuck it might go cop another coupe today
Sipping on that UGK
My spot stay open its never too late
Never with my family starve
Cuz never will I not hustle hard
Never (x12)
