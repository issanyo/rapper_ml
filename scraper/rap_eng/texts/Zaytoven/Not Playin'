[Intro]
Zaytoven
Uh, what's up, Zay?
Yeah, gang, damn, Rich Shoota shit
This that, this that strip club
Bitch, make it shake, uh
This that strip club shit, bitch

[Verse 1]
I'm throwin' cash on her titties, I'm throwin' cash on her ass
That bitch be catchin' a nut, then I put the bag in her bag
Your bitch on my dick and I don't gotta brag
I fucked on another bitch, now my main bitch mad
Uh, let's get it
Bought another Hellcat, I ain't even need it
Work real hard, made this shit look easy
Play with the gang, leave your ass not breathin'
Don't give me the cash, boy, your ass not leavin'
You not a goon and your man not either
You got guns but we got more heaters
Your baby mother drink a nigga up, Mojito
Five percent tint, tryna duck them people

[Bridge]
I- I'm not playin'
I swear, I- I'm not playin'

[Verse 2]
Bitch, uh, I'm pullin' straight up in that thang
Uh, I'm killing' niggas for my man
You try shoot, lil nigga lost his chains
Let off a hundred shots, that bitch pissed his pants
Dummy bricks 'til they land, uh
Gettin' big in the can, uh
Drinkin' lean, Dirty Dan
Dough ya linkin', what you thinkin'? Rich Shootas the brand
Coke brown, Santan'
I got, Macs and...
Green beams, I attach them
75 on the Draco, I'm tap them
I tackled a nigga
I blow all these racks on a nigga, uh
You can't ball like me
Spoil that bitch like me
A hundred bands, that's in Saks, lil nigga
I'm a killer, that's facts, lil nigga
Shoot up your block and I might double back, lil nigga
Can't get up on me, I'm sharp as a tack, lil nigga
They killed my brother, that's a headache
Uh, my uncle gone for a decade
Walk in the club with the rackades
Even my mother know I live the trap way
My Rollie is president, elegant, uh
She say my dick big like elephant, woah
Walked in the club with the F&N
Cubans and white bitches, yeah, I'm sexin' 'em
No callin' no textin' 'em, uh, uh
Bricks and pounds, bitch, you know that I'm stretchin' 'em
My lil niggas catchin' 'em

[Chorus]
Live my life, thug game tight
Been in the dark so long, I only move at night
I got that dark brown powder, what them cluckers like
I- (I- I- I- I- I-), I- (I-)

[Verse 3]
I beat that pack just like fuckin' Ike
I'm goin' broke, sike
Glass pipes, I give my auntie white
I'm livin' life
I keep my women right
So much damn coke, I'm swimmin' in the white
Niggas broke as shit, niggas parasites
Dogged up like Israelites
Issa knife
Notes on my tray, fuck is this? It's a kite
You might get stabbed tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
That's that, that's that prison life, haha
What you know about that prison life?
'Cause out here, I ain't livin' right
So I'm prepared for that prison life

[Chorus]
Live my life, thug game tight
Been in the dark so long, I only move at night
I got that dark brown powder, what them cluckers like
Uh, so I'm prepared for that prison life
