[Intro]
Every story got more than one side
Today I'mma tell you my side
I hurt you, you hurt me
Even exchange, listen

[Chorus]
She ain't tell ya I let her push the 'rari
She ain't tell ya I never told her sorry
She ain't tell ya she let me hit her partners
She ain't tell ya I paid for her body yeah
She ain't tell ya I let her push the 'rari
She ain't tell ya I never told her sorry no
She ain't tell ya she let me hit her partners
No, she ain't tell ya I paid for that body no

[Verse]
She ain't tell ya that money spread it out like carpet
She ain't tell ya I had her leaking like a faucet
She ever tell you, she ain't have no love for papi
She ain't tell you I gotta keep that cash on me (yuh)
She ain't tell you I gotta keep the bag on me
She ain't tell you I boost her self-esteem did she?
No she didn't tell you she'd rather play on my team, did she?
I know she told you things she didn't mean, did she?
She ain't tell you she seen three million dollars in jewelry
She ain't tell you the truth or did she cause I'm curious
She ain't tell you that check did increase my endurance
She ain't tell you materialistic girls attract me
She ain't tell you every time she leave, she coming back for me
She ain't tell you I got that Bentley truck and cashed down
She ain't tell you these plush seats feel like a couch
She ain't tell you I paid off her mama house
And I know my love leave a stain without a doubt
She ain't gon' tell you how I came through and put it down
She ain't gon' tell you how we like to club up with all these bottles
She ain't gon' tell you how I came through last night with sixty models
And I can't tell you 'bout no issues or no problems
And she ain't tell you how I flaunt her up in karats
I promise on my soul I'm never gon' be average
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah (she ain't tell you that shit though)
She ain't tell you I'm in her veins like IV
She ain't tell you we just came back from Greece
She ain't tell you that my bank account increased
She didn't tell you was the middle of the week, yeah
We woke up on a Wednesday and took a spree
She ain't tell you she was motivating me
She ain't tell you her designer bag came from me
She ain't tell you her legs stretched in Lamborghini seats (no)
If I ain't laying next to her then she can't even sleep
When she pull up she be tryna stay with me for weeks
Call me the general, you know I play for keeps
She ain't tell you I sting like Muhammad Ali

[Chorus]
She ain't tell ya I let her push the 'rari
She ain't tell ya I never told her sorry no
She ain't tell ya she let me hit her partners no
She ain't tell ya I paid for her body yeah
She ain't tell ya I let her push the 'rari
She ain't tell ya I never told her sorry
She ain't tell ya she let me hit her partners
She ain't say I paid for her body no
Oh nah, she said, he said
Fuck what they said, no, no

[Outro]
Don't be bitter, just be better
If I hurt you and you hurt me
How you paint yourself as unlucky?
