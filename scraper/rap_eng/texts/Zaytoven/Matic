Zaytiggy you a fool for this one

My wrist automatic

Pockets mathematic

Bitch so dramatic

Hit the club its cinematic

Standin on the couches all problamatic

Chokin on this aromatic

Like i'm athsmatic

Drivin fast cars whippin 'em through bad traffic

In the kitchen straight drop it like a bad habit

Jay's told me that my work was fantastic

Splittin dutch masters fillin 'em with anthrax

Ass so fat, had to glance back at it

Told her i'm two-face, let a nigga backstab it

Tity put her phat rabbit on a kraftmatic

I made her Phene for the D like a crack addict

I'm into distribution, I'm like Atlantic

I heard that panamara Porsche, view panoramic

So I told my daddy that I had to have it

It was hammer-time, he got my ass a ski mask

Copped a black caddy that I call black magic

Stash spot that I could hide a cadillac in

That Nasty Nas up in the pot that shit illmatic

I bet I make that bitch flip like gymnastics

Told this bitch blow this dick I ain't romantic

Told her move this package, she was enthusiastic

Pockets gigantic

Bust 'em out the plastic

Money in the basement, pounds in the attic

My wrist automatic

Pockets mathematic

Bitch so dramatic

Hit the club its cinematic

Standin on the couches all problamatic

Chokin on this aromatic

Like i'm athsmatic
