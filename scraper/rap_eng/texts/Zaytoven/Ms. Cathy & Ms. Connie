[Intro: Boosie Badazz]
Say Trouble, all I know is a motherfuckin' bag
I'ma die behind that bag
'Cause that bag feed a lot of motherfuckers
Lot of family asking
Lot of people you gotta look and say I got you
Real nigga, I got you
Lil cuz, I got you
Nephew, I got you nigga

[Chorus: Trouble]
Told lil mama it ain’t no problem, I got you (I got you)
Told baby mama it ain’t no problem, I got you (I got you)
Pourin' up, yeah thinking 'bout my partners, my partners
I'ma die to get this guap up if I gots to
I could never change on my nigga
Hope you don’t never change my nigga
Bitch you fuckin' wit a mobster, I’m a mobster
Bitch you fuckin' wit a mobster, I’m a mobster

[Verse 1: Trouble]
Rule number one, hey get that guap up
I remember gettin' it in that polo with the socks up
Look deep in your eyes and I can tell you tryna give socks up
Look deep in your eyes and see you lyin' and tryna plot somethin'
Oh, I don’t dig that
I remember who picked up for me when I had to sit back
I remember who sent me through loops, sent me through zigzags
Shoot out then go straight and have some shots up there at Chit Chat
Homie down the road like dawg I’m livin' through you partner
Told baby mama don’t trip I got you, I gots to
Tryna not to flip while tryna stand up on that promise
But I'ma get it 'cause my grind ain’t no stoppin'

[Chorus: Trouble]
Told lil mama it ain’t no problem, I got you (I got you)
Told baby mama it ain’t no problem, I got you (I got you)
Pourin' up, yeah thinking 'bout my partners, my partners
I'ma die to get this guap up if I gots to
I could never change on my nigga
Hope you don’t never change my nigga
Bitch you fuckin' wit a mobster, I’m a mobster
Bitch you fuckin' wit a mobster, I’m a mobster

[Verse 2: Boosie Badass]
Respect that
I'ma let it rang my nigga
Like Zay beats my niggas bang, my nigga
(You got a problem? got a problem?)
Got loyalty like a crime boss
Never leave, deep when they need me, that’s what I was taught
Every day, all day, gettin' that money bag
Lot of nights to stay up, I chewed a hundred pack
Blue dolphins
Ooh, awesome
Told my dawgs I’ll never change through this cold game
And in my letters from the pen I remain the same
Moms I got us, fuck that asking everybody
Before I let you starve, baby girl I’m whackin' everybody
Boosie

[Chorus: Trouble]
Told lil mama it ain’t no problem, I got you (I got you)
Told baby mama it ain’t no problem, I got you (I got you)
Pourin' up, yeah thinking 'bout my partners, my partners
I'ma die to get this guap up if I gots to
I could never change on my nigga
Hope you don’t never change my nigga
Bitch you fuckin' wit a mobster, I’m a mobster
Bitch you fuckin' wit a mobster, I’m a mobster
