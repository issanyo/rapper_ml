Zaytoven

[Verse 1: Trouble]
Boy you’s a bitch and you know the shit
Somebody go check ‘em, I gotta split
How you gon’ trip on another nigga
About a bitch who ain’t even your bitch
Why you ain’t flip on them other niggas?
Who took your shit, nigga you a bitch
Tryna get more niggas juice you up
That’s how I know you ain’t built for this
They asking questions, say what I’m doing
Don’t really know, they just know I’m doing it
They say that Skoob is a bad influence
They tryna say I’m a bad influence
Cigarillo please no Backwoods
Strapped like a sheriff, I’m that good
Say me and my bitch from a bad hood
Ran up the racks mean we back to it

[Hook: Trouble]
You pussy niggas know that you ain’t street
We get it all on the front street
We get it all offa back streets
Real nigga know where them packs be
You tryna trip 'bout a dirty bitch
Let this shit fly like a dirty bird
The money it’s flowing like spoken word
My girl, they durty, they durty girls

[Verse 2: Bankroll Fresh]
I got this shit in, nigga work the work
You talking that shit, bitch you got some nerve
You niggas be snitching, you know I heard
Don't let these fuck niggas know that I serve
You run with that ho and that pussy dirty
She sucked my dick and I gave her 30
That bummy bitch wasn’t even worth it
She said you broke but you always working
Always be working but still broke
Say you be selling your partner’s dope
I fuck your bitch and I copped the throat
Don’t call my phone ‘less a block or more
I’m a real trapper, my stock is stove
These broke ass rappers just mad and broke
I’mma pull up and I let it go
I got the kel-tec and it’s thirty loaded

[Hook: Trouble]
You pussy niggas know that you ain’t street
We get it all on the front street
We get it all offa back streets
Real nigga know where them packs be
You tryna trip 'bout a dirty bitch
Let this shit fly like a dirty bird
The money it’s flowing like spoken word
My girl, they durty, they durty girls

[Verse 3: B Green]
I be the recipe to the streets
I’m sacking out like I’m KFC
Free 350, yeah he from the 3
Eastlake Zone 6 that where I be
RIP KP, got a sister named P
Got caught stealin' that mescaline, now my arm flooded wit a AP
Know these niggas hate me, cause these niggas ain’t me
Better keep it on the sidewalk nigga cause you niggas ain’t street
I keep a big bank roll, on a track with Bankroll
Trouble Trouble, B. Green, that’s a full two man team

[Hook: Trouble]
You pussy niggas know that you ain’t street
We get it all on the front street
We get it all offa back streets
Real nigga know where them packs be
You tryna trip 'bout a dirty bitch
Let this shit fly like a dirty bird
The money it’s flowing like spoken word
My girl, they durty, they durty girls
