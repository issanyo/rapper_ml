[Hook]
I bet they peekin'
When I pull up in my ride
I bet they peekin'
When they talk about gettin high
I bet they peakin'
Check the levels on my rhymes mane
I bet they peakin'
Beat it beat it I got a sign that says no peekin'
Look, no peekin'

[Verse 1]
I'm a leader I know, I got this rap in my soul/
I make these po's act fast but they ain't slowin the goal/
I take the mission to skull, and feel the Lord in my bones/
The only time I curse these hataz is when they curse at the throne/
I need bottles of water, I chug em and reign on these clowns/
So high, for Halloween I went as a cloud/
I move mountains and crowds, pray and smoke on ground/
On some fly shit, I forgot what this rap is about/
I guess they peek at my style, cause I could blind em from miles/
Take a few trips and when I come back bloaw owe/
Think we need a medic, I'm sick they hate pathetic
I'm an entertainer like Cedric
Only God could bless it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm a fool wit it, what ur heart beatin for/
Mine's ATLiens, spaceage bak on schedule fam/
I assume a summer jam, hot enough to make you Ham... Or
Even yams, I'm a country eatin man/
Fat enough to stretch her legs, if I fuck depends on her head/ whoa
I'ma say a no shame, witha you already know/
Took her out to dinner, cause I roleplayed as a dentist/
She didn't even eat her food, all she wanted was the D/
She drinking Sunny D with me, on beaches in a week/
Bedrock til its weak, that your roommates wanna peek/
And your bestfriend wanna freak, cause she heard I made you scream/
She ain't peein a stream boy she beamin me with cream bouy
Givin me that mean look,  these hataz wanna eat then cook (cook)))))
Like a mug, you ain't gotta be a thug/
2Pac died for us, you oughta know what for/
They say that I'm preachin, well there's bibles in the store/
Make money for the Lord, and I'm smokin in accordance/
I know they say its sin, but its a sin if I don't love Him/
And you too, famous without a youtube/
I'm too ugly for fame, so all I get that brain/ (uhh on the peak)))))
