[Intro: Natasha Mosley & Gucci Mane]
Whoop that ass
Gucci
Aw yeah, yeah
Wop
Mmm
It's Gucci, burr, burr
Dodge

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I just want you to fuck me like you need me
Text me when you leave me
Bein' with him hard as hell
But bein' with me is easy
Breezy, freaky
Get excited when you see me
Touch me, tease me
Get mad when you can't reach me
Gucci Mane and Tasha
And Zaytiggy and the beazzie
Tasha, you so sexy, fly
You out like every weekend
I'm diggin', she reachin'
I'm climbin', she peekin'
I expect grown folks to hate on us
Girl, everybody's peepin'
I'm not so gangsta that I can say
I love the way she slingin'
Gucci Mane a money man
Look at all the cash I'm bringin'
I will show you like 200 thou
And that's just on one pinkie
Girl, you got me feelin' drunk
And I'm not even drinkin'

[Hook: Natasha Mosley]
Boy, you got me drunk and I ain't even drinkin'
Faded off your love and I ain't even thinkin'
I love it when you come and hit it when you leavin'
I love it when you come and hit it when you leavin'
Boy, you got me drunk and I ain't even drinkin'
Faded off your love and I ain't even thinkin'
I love it when you come and hit it when you leavin'
I love it when you come and hit it when you leavin'

[Verse 2: Natasha Mosley]
Boy, you makin' all the flips
We takin' shoppin' trips
Coppin' drops and shit
Both got rocks on wrists, got rocks on fists
Ooh we ain't even worried 'bout these bitches
Droppin' hits, ain't got a pot to piss
Her man no boyfriend until my partner quit
Relockin' this
Just don't be makin' promises you won't keep, baby
Time for you to show how much you want me, baby
Pick me up and put me where you want me, baby
I ain't had your love yet, so don't leave, baby
What that I like
Just here without you and I knew it
It feel like a knife
Just the type I like
And you so fine, you make it my mind
Just at 3 clock in the mornin' when you hungry
This that I gotta have it, your one and only
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Natasha Mosley]
Boy, you got me drunk and I ain't even drinkin'
Faded off your love and I ain't even thinkin'
I love it when you come and hit it when you leavin'
I love it when you come and hit it when you leavin'
Boy, you got me drunk and I ain't even drinkin'
Faded off your love and I ain't even thinkin'
I love it when you come and hit it when you leavin'
I love it when you come and hit it when you leavin'

[Outro: Natasha Mosley & Gucci Mane]
