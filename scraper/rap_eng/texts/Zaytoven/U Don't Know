[Intro]
Zaytoven
You just don’t know
You don’t know how I
How I fucked with you

[Chorus]
On the slide I really fuck with you
On the slide I had some love for you
On the slide you really fucked it up
While on the ride how could you fuck it up
On the slide I really yeah
You don’t know
You just don’t know how I
You just don’t know what I would do for you
You just don’t know how I
Just don’t know what it feel like
Just don’t know what it

[Verse 1]
I told my OG I owe her my life he said I don’t
Being somebody that nobody seem to een want, I just was lost
Had a few goons of course
Had a few bitches of course
I’ve been a player
I just ain’t had me no money
Took a real nigga to blitz me
Next thing is bills
All in the living room
You see this shit in the living room
I will go live in the living room
I can see me couple million soon
I can see G gettin' a million soon
I can see B gettin' another one
You play with him then you know you’re done
I just won’t play for my brother them
Pull up and lounge and shit
All on his Colin Kaepernick have a place and he gon be the man and shit
Turn hoes into fans and shit
Thought you was my mans and shit
You out here pillow talking to these bitches
That ain’t how we’re playing this shit
I thought we were fam and shit
Damn

[Chorus]
On the slide I really fuck with you
On the slide I had some love for you
On the slide you really fucked it up
While on the ride how could you fuck it up
On the slide I really yeah
You don’t know
You just don’t know how I
You just don’t know what I would do for you
You just don’t know how I
Just don’t know what it feel like
Just don’t know what it

[Verse 2]
How do you live with me
Why do you live with me
I show you nothing but love
I prayed your family get blessings
Nigga I mean it forreal
How can you tell me you love me
You ain’t showed me nothing like it in years
Back of the back I pay hospital bills
Grandma in pain that shit brings me to tears
Shit ain’t the same wit my niggas to feel
Man it’s a whole different feel
We all gotta shake a little time from the field
Hope he don’t gotta do time from the field (I'll do it nigga, know waz hannin)
But if you do then it is what it is
I got your back I told him that dude
And my godfather say the same thang
Trill is trill does, that'll never change
While these pussy n*ggas they gon switch lanes (fuck)
If you get going shit you’re all on your own

[Chorus]
On the slide I really fuck with you
On the slide I had some love for you
On the slide you really fucked it up
While on the ride how could you fuck it up
On the slide I really yeah
You don’t know
You just don’t know how I
You just don’t know what I would do for you
You just don’t know how I
Just don’t know what it feel like
Just don’t know what it
