[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Verse 1]
You know they uh, they hate when we make it
Too many niggas wrote statements
We were scarred since babies
I put my heart in it baby
Look I've been starving lately
See they hated on Jesus too I got my guards up baby
Ima make 'em hate us too, I can't let up
You don't know all the bullshit I been through, but it getting better
You don't know how many funerals I been to, I hate to tell ya
You don't know how many times I hit that road to go see fella
And they ask me why you so stiff Ray, cause niggas still hate, give 'em a dollar and they still take, you niggas still fake
Man I'm just tryna live like Bill Gates, make sure my kids straight and I ain't goin' in the house until I get my bill paid

[Chorus]
Wonder if you gon make it, go and find out
They say I wouldn't make it, till I climbed out
I was somewhere being patient, it's my time now
I was being patient, we gon grind now
Wonder if you gon make it, go and find out
They say I wouldn't make it, till I climbed out
I was somewhere being patient, it's my time now
I was being patient, we gon grind now

[Verse 2]
Too much blood shed a tear for the pain
Certain shit just won't never be the same
They left me standing in the cold once again
They turned they back how could they ever be my friend
You know money bring power
The rest of it bring hate
We come from runnin' in houses
Shit all we knew was to take
But now we got what it take yeah
A young gorilla in the hood now I might rock a Bape
That .308 take down a bear turned that boy to a mink
So much damn money on my mind don't give a fuck what you think
Now every chain every diamond we afford cuban link
Knowing me man on my grind man I'm tryna feed the team yeah

[Chorus]
Wonder if you gon make it, go and find out
They say I wouldn't make it, till I climbed out
I was somewhere being patient, it's my time now
I was being patient, we gon grind now
Wonder if you gon make it, go and find out
They say I wouldn't make it, till I climbed out
I was somewhere being patient, it's my time now
I was being patient, we gon grind now
