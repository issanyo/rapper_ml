Intro/Hook

Twist down into it
Drink cold, Ice cube it
Twist down into it
Sprite cold, I'm Coolin
Twist down into it
Sprite cold, Ice cube it


Verse

I feel like Lil Yachty, when I open up a Sprite
Wouldn't't tell you drink it, cuz i drink it everynight
Im a Rookie and a Vet
Tell my crew cut the check
Double Team or Triple Threat
I got greatness in my flesh
Just obey me, like your thirst
Take a sip, and write a verse
Make a million off a verse?
I won't tell you what im worth
And, my flow so diverse
That the Bank got bigger
The flow got girth
And the paper got preserved
Diamonds wet like I’m sponsored by a beverage
She let me slide cuz she know that i got leverage
Thats the story, Imma tell it
Im good at Sprite
Thousands cases on Credit
You are looking at a legend!

Back to the music
REAL revolution
Like the Harlem Renaissance
Bumpin’ Biggie in the Bronx
BIG ‘round the city
Cuz im moving like a Don
Word around the city
That Im really with the Mob
Lyrically Superior
Broad from Nigeria
Haters keep talking
I Silenece them, Librarian
Don’t do this for ya’ll
Do this for my area
Real Philly arrogance
My crown I’m not sharing it
