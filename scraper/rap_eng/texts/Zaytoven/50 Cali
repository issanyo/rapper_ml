[Intro]
I'ma get that iron, go and get the bally
All these niggas lying like they're 50 Cali
All these niggas lying, got the sickest tally
All these shots are flying, niggas dip and dally
Better grip a knife, better grip a Stanley
Smash him with a bat, nigga's hit a whammy
Damn a nigga nice, gotta get a Grammy
Fam I've got the strally out, kinda hit him jammy

[Verse 1]
All these jumping stacks, all these jumping stacks
Nigga grab the Mac, got him jumping back
Got 'em jumping 'round, like they're jumping jacks
Always talking shit, they ain't jumping jack
Used to hunt the trap, used to front a stack
Now I grab the mic, like a hundred racks
Made a little space, now I hung the plaque
Got another one, so I hung the plaque
Got a funky vibe from a funky pack
They don't wanna ride, they don't wanna clap
They don't wanna die, they just wanna rap
They don't wanna cry, they just want him back

[Chorus] (x2)
Niggas gonna ride, niggas gonna dash
Niggas gonna die, bodies going splat
Niggas going by, strallys going blap
Strallys going blap, everybody flat

[Verse 2]
On the otherside everybody's gassed
Damn a nigga fire, damn a nigga flash
Bag of niggas tried, bag of niggas flat
Bag a bigger pie, that's a bigger stack
Used to bag a tight little bit of crack
Started with a 9 then I brang 'em back
Then the shots were flying, niggas banging straps
Niggas started banging so we bang 'em back
Niggas tried to bring it so we brang it back
Niggas started ringing so we rang it back
Niggas started swinging so we swang it back
Niggas just some gimmicks, I'm that man in black

[Chorus] (x2)
Niggas gonna ride, niggas gonna dash
Niggas gonna die, bodies going splat
Niggas going by, strallys going blap
Strallys going blap, everybody flat
