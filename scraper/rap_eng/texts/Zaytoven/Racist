[Hook: Chief Keef]
I put big ass rims on my car
Money long, this shit going too far
I pulled twenty bad bitches riding in my car
I told them bitches, "bitch I'm freaking you tomorrow"
Police pulled me over they thought I was racing
I told 'em my car ain't with the damn pacing
Got my guns from Indiana think they with the Pacers
I only like green, she like boy you racist

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Girl I got money all in my fucking pocket
I don't like talking you can leave if you ain't fucking
I ain't want to fuck you anyway bitch you musty
Baby girl you dusty but my car do all the dusting
I'm riding in my Beamer, Bieber bitch, Justin
I'm screaming obscenities bitch I'm cussing
She acting like a Bee for the weed bitch be buzzing
I told her 'bout my money, she can go and meet my cousin
Rest in peace Blood if he was here he'll be mugging
My car Superbad I done named it McLovin
I told her I'mma leave my pants on while we fucking
I only want to fuck you for ten minutes then I'm nutting
I'm nothing

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I'm sipping red, I paid 600 for the pint
800 dollar Margelas, fuck your Nikes
Bitch buggin', told me thousand dollars for the night
I say I'm Chief Sosa, I ain't never paid in my life
Blowing smoke in the police face bitch I know my rights
I don't give no fuck you can tell how I'm running lights
Don't leap if you a frog fuck nigga get hit with pipe
I don't like woods that much, I'm rolling big ass whites
That's big ass joints
Now you know it fuck nigga piped down
I'm so turnt up can't even put my pipe down
I'm so bossed up think I live up in the White House
You see me salute me when you see me or it's fucking lights out

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
I told that bitch she can't touch my dreads
I'm smoking tooka counting on the deads
She say I'm tweaking I ain't even take my meds
Tatted like a Migo bitch my skin filled with lead
Nigga talking down fill him up with lead
I'm flexing so hard, I should buy a watch for my leg
Since he sending messages he get hit in the legs
I'm friends with UPS and Fedex
I'm full I ain't even eat my eggs
I got an uzi with a cooling kit and kick
I start to pour it out, it's pouring out the fifth
