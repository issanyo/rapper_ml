[Intro]
Zaytoven
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woo!

[Chorus]
Gone in the sky, over 20,000 I keep my wifi lit
I spend over 5,000, that's just on one fit (woah, woah)
I'm not going back no more when I ain't have shit (no)
Pray I get a new connect, pray I get a brick

[Verse 1]
I leave a bitch in the cold, oh
I don't act poor no more
I left her sitting at the Loews, oh
'Cause she wasn't touching her toes, no
I'm on some rich nigga shit
It's all about rich nigga timing
Fully loaded whip
I'ma curve you with kindness
I'm in Hermes drip, not in the store, you can't find it
I got stacks on me and they won't fit no wallet
I got Gucci socks on me and money in every pocket
I got Burberry seats, the color teriyaki
I'm on another wave
Cut the head off the Porsche (cut it off)
Running with a pack of wolves, ain't no extorting (no extorting)
VIP with AK's, very important (brr)
Always riding with a gas torch (gas)
Always riding with a mask
Young nigga playing with a pinky ring
Cost over 500 bags (500 bags)
Already know your homie singing, they 'bout to get him wacked
Soon as you let up, relax?
That's when they wait to attack
Platinum majority of the plaques (platinum majority)
Striking it off like a match (skrt, skrt)

[Chorus]
Gone in the sky, over 20,000 I keep my wifi lit (skrt, skrt)
I spend over 5,000, that's just on one fit (that's on one fit)
I'm not going back no more when I ain't have shit (ain't never)
Pray I get a new connect, pray I get a brick (uh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
You came from public housing, you serving hand to hand, oh
You got that good salmon, it's smoking and fresh out the can (oh, oh)
You know how to stir your bowl up, you know how to flip your bands (oh, oh)
I'm bout to go take 200,000, just to go shop in Japan (oh, oh)
I know the opps they thinking foul, we 'bout to take out they mans (ooh)
We got to make some bullets shower, show you we ain't playing (ooh)
You gon' smell this gun powder, it's gon' make you dance (ooh)
I've been counting it up for hours, done cramped my hands (oh)

[Chorus]
Gone in the sky, over 20,000 I keep my wifi lit (whoa, whoa)
I spend over 5,000, that's just on one fit (whoa, whoa)
I'm not going back no more when I ain't have shit (no, no)
Pray I get a new connect, pray I get a brick (pray, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Wifi lit, woah, woah, woah
Wifi lit (wifi lit)
Pass the bitch, woah, woah, woah
That's an assist (that's an assist)
Cooking grits, woah, woah, woah
Half a chicken (cookin' it up)
Fuck your clique, (fuck your clique) woah woah, woah, we got them sticks (brr, brr)
Wifi lit, wifi lit
Wifi lit, wifi lit
Wifi lit, wifi lit
Wifi lit, wifi lit
Wifi lit
(Auntie, auntie)
Wifi lit, whoa-oh-oh, wifi lit
Shoutout to Lil Mexico, Kirkwood
Pass the bitch, whoa-oh-oh, that's an assist
(Auntie, auntie)
Cookin' grits, whoa-whoa-oh, half a check
JB, know I mean
Drop by, I got you
You hear me
Fuck your clique, whoa-whoa-whoa
Let's go!
