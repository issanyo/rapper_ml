[Intro]
Zaytoven
Woah, Lil Mexico
You know I been jumped off the porch, fool
Taliban
I don't know about you
Woah

[Chorus]
It was 1998 when I first jumped off the porch
They tore down a nigga hood, rest in peace [?] court
Boy you swimmin' with the sharks when you jump in the street
I got a whole bunch of killers and they ridin' with me
I been jumped off the porch, yeah I just jumped off the porch
It was back in '98 when I first jumped off the porch
Burned out on the charge, and don't back to court
Run off in a nigga's shit, he then respectin' the boy

[Verse 1]
I was raised by felons, they taught me never tell it
Still, ride with the heat and I'm a convicted felon
When you trappin' in the crack house gotta stay on yo toes
When a smoker serve a smoker, yeah he break off the blow
Fuck them niggas down the street 'cause down the street they some hoes
I bet we gettin' the most money 'cause we be fuckin' their hoes
Don't pillow talk to these bitches, that is part of the game
Any time you mention me, better put respect on my name
Any time I'm in your city bet I'm rockin' my chains
I bet a hundred niggas pull up when you mention my name
Maceo's the trending topic, pussy nigga just stop it
I heard them niggas had to rob you you ain't do shit about it

[Chorus]
It was 1998 when I first jumped off the porch
They tore down a nigga hood, rest in peace [?] court
Boy you swimmin' with the sharks when you jump in the street
I got a whole bunch of killers and they ridin' with me
I been jumped off the porch, yeah I just jumped off the porch
It was back in '98 when I first jumped off the porch
Burned out on the charge, and don't back to court
Run off in a nigga's shit, he then respectin' the boy

[Verse 2]
Burned out on the charge, I don't go back to court
[?], still, watch for the narcs
Got like three or four spots, all them motherfucker boomin'
We ain't sittin' on the work, boy we get it and move it
Every time we hit the club I bet we makin' a movie
And my young niggas they brazy, he snuck in with the Uzi
Ain't no flinchin' in them Tom Fords
I gotta know that you gon' ride for it
I got some killers they gon' die for it
It's gon' be a war and you and I know it
Wasn't shit handed to me, had to get it out the mud
Four or five plugs, I don't pay for drugs

[Chorus]
It was 1998 when I first jumped off the porch
They tore down a nigga hood, rest in peace [?] court
Boy you swimmin' with the sharks when you jump in the street
I got a whole bunch of killers and they ridin' with me
I been jumped off the porch, yeah I just jumped off the porch
It was back in '98 when I first jumped off the porch
Burned out on the charge, and don't back to court
Run off in a nigga's shit, he then respectin' the boy
