[Intro]
Icy
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
I want this one, this one, this one, this one, this
Agua, agua, agua on my wrist (yeah, drip, drop)
I want this style, I want this
This one, this one, this one, this one, this
I want this, this one, this one, this
I got agua on my wrist
This one, this one, this one, this one, this
This one, this one, this one, this one, this

[Verse 1]
Versace kimono drapin' on me
I mix the Kimora with Naomi
The world is mine, sometimes I feel like Tony
I just poured a fountain on my Rollie
Ask your girl about me, I'm that bitch
I slide one times, two times, three times, four times, fifth
My wishlist is too big for your paper, it don't fit
That's why I get my own gifts
I want this one, this one, this

[Chorus]
I want this one, this one, this one, this one, this
Agua, agua, agua on my wrist (yeah, drip, drop)
I want this style, I want this
This one, this one, this one, this one, this
I want this, this one, this one, this
I got agua on my wrist
This one, this one, this one, this one, this
This one, this one, this one, this one, this

[Verse 2]
All of this designer in my closet
Diamonds in my ear, I don't hear gossip
I can balance all of this Balenciaga
I got more money than your baby father
I got options in my Rolodex
Scroll through niggas like a Pok√©dex
I'm gon' finesse
Bossanova straight to my address
No thank you text, grab my Amex, then I'm quick to dip
I just take my pick
I like this one, this one, this

[Chorus]
I want this one, this one, this one, this one, this
Agua, agua, agua on my wrist (yeah, drip, drop)
I want this style, I want this
This one, this one, this one, this one, this
I want this, this one, this one, this
I got agua on my wrist
This one, this one, this one, this one, this
This one, this one, this one, this one, this
I want this one, this one, this one, this one, this
Agua, agua, agua on my wrist (yeah, drip, drop)
I want this style, I want this
This one, this one, this one, this one, this
I want this, this one, this one, this
I got agua on my wrist
This one, this one, this one, this one, this
This one, this one, this one, this one, this
This one, this one, this one, this
I got agua on my wrist
This one, this one, this one, this one, this
This one, this one, this one, this one, this

[Outro]
I want this one, this one, this one, this one, this
Agua, agua, agua on my wrist (yeah, drip, drop)
I want this style, I want this
