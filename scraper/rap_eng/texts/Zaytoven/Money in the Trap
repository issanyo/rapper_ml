[Intro: Rockie Fresh]
Yeah
Young Rockie checkin' in, yeah
I just want the money, yeah
Look

[Chorus: Rockie Fresh]
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I be sippin' strong, these niggas sippin' tap
You can tell 'em it's a wrap, money in the trap, yeah

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
I pulled up stuntin' in them BM-dubs
Hold it down, all these pretty bitches showin' love, yeah
I don't really go out to the club
I got the party in the crib, throwin' money up
I stepped in, Yeezys on
What's the plan, switched to Vans
Holler at me, I'm the man
Tell these hoes they understand, whoa, yeah
Understand that it's game time
And I ain't trippin' off what ain't mine
I come through on East Wine when a nigga want beef
I can stay up all night, bitch I won't sleep
For the promise that I'm gon' eat
Young nigga hustle hard all week

[Chorus: Rockie Fresh]
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I be sippin' strong, these niggas sippin' tap
You can tell 'em it's a wrap, money in the trap, yeah
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I be sippin' strong, these niggas sippin' tap
You can tell 'em it's a wrap, money in the trap, yeah

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
I say now money in the trap, money in the trap
He be sippin' Quali, I be sippin' Act
I fucked the bitch once but I won't run it back
She be blowin' up my phone, want me to take her back
Lil Moschino on my belt, see I be in designer
These jeans YSL, see that's another thousand
Seminary nigga right in front of housing
Got the Wraith parked outside, that's three hundred thousand
Look I pulled up in a foreign with the doors up
That broke bitch up on my dick, she ain't got no love
I remember back then she had her nose up
But all this money in the trap got me froze up, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Rockie Fresh]
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I be sippin' strong, these niggas sippin' tap
You can tell 'em it's a wrap, money in the trap, yeah
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I be sippin' strong, these niggas sippin' tap
You can tell 'em it's a wrap, money in the trap, yeah

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
I got money in the trap but I do the rap
If my bro throw me the live I'ma make it happen
Got some bitches on the job, yeah we really stackin'
Pulled up in that new five, got it off of rappin'
Yeah I told her she can't fuck with a boss if she don't act right
Six months on the road, yeah I gotta get my cash right
Diamonds dancin' all up in the dark like a black light
Crazy with the vision, see the money with a flashlight, damn
We the realest niggas that stepped in the building
Tap my bro up on the arm like your bitch look familiar
I'm 'bout to make a million, I'm like fuck your feelings
A nigga trappin' swag, I ain't drug dealing

[Chorus: Rockie Fresh]
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I be sippin' strong, these niggas sippin' tap
You can tell 'em it's a wrap, money in the trap, yeah
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I be sippin' strong, these niggas sippin' tap
You can tell 'em it's a wrap, money in the trap, yeah

[Verse 4: Fat Trel]
Shit I got money in my belt, it ain't no rake and shit
I'm not the type to make them pretty bitches wait for me
I bought a pound and Josh just rolled it in a Haitian leaf
And told them motherfuckin' suckers come and pray for me
See all my life I had to fight, I had to wait a while
My mama cried like every day, I had to make her smile
I made a play and caught the cake and counted thirty straight
That shit remind me of a tour I had for thirty K
So now it's money comin' in, money goin' out
Them pints comin' from the North, I make her go South
A hood full of young niggas, watch me hold it down
Some bullshit, I press a button, shoot a hundred rounds

[Chorus: Rockie Fresh]
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I be sippin' strong, these niggas sippin' tap
You can tell 'em it's a wrap, money in the trap, yeah
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I be sippin' strong, these niggas sippin' tap
You can tell 'em it's a wrap, money in the trap, yeah
