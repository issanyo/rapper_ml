[Verse 1: Smug Mang]
It's a, it's another beautiful day in Sasne
[?] whatever you say
I've been up 48 hours straight
Rollin' off the molly or the sniffy or off the yay
Smug Life, good life, every day we celebrate
[?] Smuggin' we gon' calibrate
Grandma and my mama is the only reason I graduate
Pull out Xans in highschool Smugga, yeah cause I couldn't wait
I don't care what they say, yeah throw some dirt on Smug Mang
I just throw some hundreds back in their face
Movin' on Smug [?], fast paced
Zooted off these bars so give me my Voss and my space
Hoe you wasn't back in my [?]
Killer god, mean flow, in and outer space
[?]
But who the fuck to blame, who the fuck to blame?
Cause nowadays every know Smug Mang (Smuuug Muusic)
A.k.a. Drug Mang, a.k.a. Xan Lord
A.k.a. your bitch give me head in your car
Hangin' with all the mob, fuckin' Smug Stars
Doin' drugs, sellin' drugs
Rollin' dice, playin' cards
Young Smuggas, young skins, cause that's who we are
That's who we motherfuckin' are

[Verse 2: Chris Travis]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
I just got here
Air Max on the side of the border
I'm ocean shore lookin' for some weed and a order
Young Memphis nigga but my bitch stay in Georgia
Got a bitch down in Florida and a [?] where it's warm
Bitch I'm talkin' country clubs, I'm connected with the farmers
Cash crop while we hustle [?]
[?]
Get 'em in, get 'em out, it get hotter up in the summer
I lay shit down and you get laid down
And I make it to my dungeon like I'm feelin' safe now
'Bouta K now, yeah a hundred K now
I don't really talk guns but this hatin' make rounds pussy
