[Chorus: Young Dolph]
You got bitches, I got bitches, but my bitches badder
I got skrilla, you got skrilla, but my skrilla longer
Your bitch thick and my bitch thick, but my bitch ass much fatter
We say we gang, they say they gang, but my gang way more stronger
You got ice and I got ice, but my shit hit more harder
I got whips and you got whips, but all my whips is foreign
I got bitches, you got bitches, but my bitches badder
You got bitches, I got bitches, but my bitches badder

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Drop top with my shirt off
On my way to drop your girl off
These rocks on me, they hit
These rocks they Liu Kang kickin'
This philippe cost honcho
Half a million at the condo
Got more ammo than the gun store
VS 30 pointers in my watch
Ayy, 30 hollow tips in my Glock
I do magic, I turn nothin' into somethin'
My trap down just Kriss Kross jumpin'
These big diamonds on me chunky
Lil rich nigga, it's hard for me to hide it (for real)
If it don't cost a quarter million then I can't drive it (naw)
20 bad bitches at the party and it's private
Everyday we smokin' weed and party like it's Friday

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
You got bitches, I got bitches, but my bitches badder
I got skrilla, you got skrilla, but my skrilla longer
Your bitch thick and my bitch thick, but my bitch ass much fatter
We say we gang, they say they gang, but my gang way more stronger
You got ice and I got ice, but my shit hit more harder
I got whips and you got whips, but all my whips is foreign
I got bitches, you got bitches, but my bitches badder
You got bitches, I got bitches, but my bitches badder

[Verse 2: Hefna Gwap]
You got whips and I got whips, you got sticks and I got sticks
Let's meet up and have a shootout, nigga, fuck the rappin' shit
[?] like the trappin' shit, y'all be with the cappin' shit
Jefe should've been a pimp, Jefe like to smack a bitch
Yeah you got the rave boy, but [?] got the [?] nigga
Your bitch been with me three days and she won't go home, nigga
Solitaires on me goin' off like an alarm, nigga
Thousand bags of OG like we got our own farm, nigga
Fresh up out the clink, I just beat another charge, nigga
Heard you runnin' off with that, pussy tryna dodge niggas
All my bitches foreign and they love 'em all, nigga
Walk inside the Gucci store, they treat me like a god, nigga

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
You got bitches, I got bitches, but my bitches badder
I got skrilla, you got skrilla, but my skrilla longer
Your bitch thick and my bitch thick, but my bitch ass much fatter
We say we gang, they say they gang, but my gang way more stronger
You got ice and I got ice, but my shit hit more harder
I got whips and you got whips, but all my whips is foreign
I got bitches, you got bitches, but my bitches badder
You got bitches, I got bitches, but my bitches badder

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
Seven chains on (bloaw)
Rollie on my left, Patek on my right arm
Ayy, you in the way
If you ain't gettin' paid, fuck niggas get played
Never give my heart to a bitch, never give my heart to a bitch
You should see the look on they face, they still mad 'cause I got rich
What the fuck?
Whole lotta ice made her wanna spend the night
Whole lotta stacks made me get a bigger pack
Whole lotta hustlin' 'cause a whole lotta flexin'
She all in her feelings, now she doin a lotta textin'
Turnt up in the trap, call that a whole lotta blessings

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
You got bitches, I got bitches, but my bitches badder
I got skrilla, you got skrilla, but my skrilla longer
Your bitch thick and my bitch thick, but my bitch ass much fatter
We say we gang, they say they gang, but my gang way more stronger
You got ice and I got ice, but my shit hit more harder
I got whips and you got whips, but all my whips is foreign
I got bitches, you got bitches, but my bitches badder
You got bitches, I got bitches, but my bitches badder
