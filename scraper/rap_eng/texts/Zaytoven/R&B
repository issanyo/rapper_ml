Ohh-ohh-ahh-yeahh

[Verse 1]
Once again, your man left you all alone tonight
Send me thirst trap pics to my phone tonight
If he knew what we were doing you’d get smoke tonight
Name your favorite place and we gon' go tonight
I got gas in that pre-roll, you don't even smoke it
Told me blow that out the window
When we in your car, you only wanna hear R&B
You like to play when we sexing
I know you gon' probably throw on Ginuwine
Missy, Aaliyah, Beyoncé
You might throw on Kells
Maxwell, Jhené, or The Weeknd

[Verse 2]
Now when I get that text, you coming over, right?
I just hop out in that Porsche and go in over drive
Like our sex when we play, "Bump N Grind” on replay
But I lose my mind in that thing, I lose my mind in that thing yeah
And I just made a playlist
Filled with all your favorites
Yeah, let's wake up all the neighbors
I wanna hear you loud, yeah
