[Intro]
You're in the mix
With the world famous DJ ???
(Zaytoven)

[Chorus]
I thought you had sway
Thought you was the one
But you wasn't
My ?loose? only sway
?Here's what I catch, look what I mustered?
Fu-fuck you I was gon' stand outside
You're gonna beat it
But you wasn't
Said you was real
But you wasn't
Until my shit ain't talking about nothing

You ain't talking about nothing
You ain't talking about nothing
Ain't talking about bitch ain't no thing
Ain't talking about bitch ain't no thing

[Verse 1]
I thought you had your own
You little broke out little boy, you keep putting on
You do the most that's why I don't fuck with your games
You said you run your block you said you have on sway
Thought you said you was thought you said you was
Yeah yeah
Thought you was gonna make me double back like two cups
That double cup up

[Chorus]
I thought you had sway
Thought you was the one
But you wasn't
My ?loose? only sway
?Here's what I catch, look what I mustered?
Fu-fuck you I was gon' stand outside
You're gonna beat it
But you wasn't
Said you was real
But you wasn't
Until my shit ain't talking about nothing

You ain't talking about nothing
You ain't talking about nothing
Ain't talking about bitch ain't no thing
Ain't talking about bitch ain't no thing

[Verse 2]
I guess I was wrong about it
I had to make a song about it yeah yeah
Said you been in the latest fashion, you'd be smashing, you'd be acting, talking about nothing, you be flexing, you was capping
Thought you know I had my own
I'm getting money don't need your bank roll
Push your pot, your ass like zoom
You know I'm kicking, shit comes through
Because I

[Chorus]

You're gonna beat it
But you wasn't
Said you was real
But you wasn't
Until my shit ain't talking about nothing
