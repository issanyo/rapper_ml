[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
A thousand, two, two thousand grams, I doubled it (Remixed)
You ain't talkin' money, thats irrelevant (Uh-uh)
On Tuesday, whip my dope up in the frying pan (Whip)
Just got a truck in, me and Juggman (Jugg)
I'm a paper chaser, he a money maker (Count up)
Really ain't no different, we both 'bout that paper (Count up)
Ten toes down for them Freebandz (Bands)
Buy a brick, you know you get two hundred extra grams (Lets go)
Now everyday I wake up, I see dollar signs (Dollar signs)
You say you wanna shine, then stay on your grind (Grind nigga)
Don't take a day off, hustle all the time (Hustle)
I put wings on the bricks and let the birds fly (Take off)

[Verse 2: Yung Ralph]
I blowed a couple mil on my last deal (Mil)
Hundred K, exec, I spent that on my last wheels (Work)
I'm on the block, serve a half a pound to Scooter (What)
Told my label, I need an extra budget for my shooter (Blaww)
Yeah I fuck with Scooter, Black Amigo got the packs (Salute)
Walk in with the money, walk out with a sack (Work)
VVS's on my body yell, "Freebandz"
And all my bitches got cribs, a.k.a. "Free land"
Word on the street (Whats that?), Juggman back (Okay)
The pints of the lean (What else?), the green and the crack (What else?)
All this work, and I still ain't high (Nah)
All I do is jugg, jugg, jugg, I'm thinkin' 'bout retirin' (Rap)

[Chorus: Yung Ralph & Young Scooter]
I be on the block (Block), with them syrup sippers (Lean)
Them weed sellers (Yeah), and them bird flippers (Birds)
I be on the block (The Block), with them syrup sippers (Lean)
Them weed sellers (Yeah), and them bird flippers (Lets go)
All we do is hustle, get that money, make it double (Count up)
All we do is hustle, get that money, make it double (Count up)
All we do is hustle, get that money, make it double (Count up)
All we do is hustle, get that money, make it double (Lets go)
