(Chorus)
This world gets so crazy, but I feel so amazing when I got you, girl
This feeling is so scary, I would dump Halle Berry cuz she's not you, girl
Baby, what you on tonight?
Maybe get it on all night
Anxious cuz you're all I like
They hating cuz we're stars tonight

(Verse 1)
Baby, I'ma draw your bath like a picture
Then drink your elixir
All over your body, give you kisses
Gotta appreciate it or see me in your distance
I can get any woman's number in here if I wanted
What's important right now is the fact I want it with you
Why he saying that? Cuz he's laying mack
I don't want no issues
If I'm stating facts, and you state 'em back
Then I can't misuse
I'm trying to love you
That's all it was
Passionate love, candle lit tub
It's just us two
Can you handle my love
You melt from my touch, my hands on your butt

(Chorus)
This world gets so crazy, but I feel so amazing when I got you, girl
This feeling is so scary, I would dump Halle Berry cuz she's not you, girl
Baby, what you on tonight?
Maybe get it on all night
Anxious cuz you're all I like
They hating cuz we're stars tonight
