[Verse 1]
This nigga Game definition of a rap nigga
I'm not a lover or a fighter, I'm a trap nigga
On Twitter talking about you want to scrap nigga
Well I'll knock you out and drag you to the trap nigga
The real deal Holyfield CTE killer
And I can't lie I done robbed a lot of Cali niggas
I know some real OG's in L.A nigga
Last time I checked I was the shit in the Bay nigga
A Sacramento nigga used to send the dope to me
Humble County kush my plug sent the smoke to me
CEO Gucci, Eazy-E my idol nigga
I heard your brother is a gangster, he not your brother nigga

[Verse 2]
The realest nigga in the rap game, hands down
You showing your ass nigga yeah you got your pants down
I'm talking M's now not hundred grands now
I'll take your life and you'll never meet your grandchild
If you ever had a plug nigga stand up
If a nigga tried to rob you nigga man up
You ever ran off just to run your bands up
You ever went broke damn fuck the lights cut
These niggas would suck a nigga dick to make a hit record
I'll never dick ride that's why I'm a legend
I never snitched now time not even 60 seconds
Got so much street cred that these niggas disrespected
