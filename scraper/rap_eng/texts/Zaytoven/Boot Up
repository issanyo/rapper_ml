[Intro: Future]
Zaytoven
Yeah
I don't want none but some boot up (boot up)
You know I put the bag on 'em
(That's that Molly in there)
Boot up, boot up, boot up

[Chorus: Future]
I don't want none but some boot up (woo)
I don't want none but some boot up (woo)

I got that work when I pull up
I don't want none but some boot up

[Verse 1: Future]
I'm tryna pass the mula (woah)
She tryna grab the mula
Shawty none but that boot up
Shawty gon' fuck all the loot up (loot up)
I got them tabs, you poppin' them D's
You better go stack you some boot up
I'm livin' like I'm Godzilla (yeah)
I'm bouta go see the killer
Takin' the lean with the pill
You don't know what that done did to me (what it)
I can't feel my face at all, higher than the chimney
I just copped this cold broad and she from the Philippines
She wanna fuck up the cost, for real
I see how she look at the Lamborghin'
You wanna take you a 'Xanny? I pass 'em out like they candy
Put my love inside a cup, pour it up at any
Shawty like the way I fuck when I'm on the Roxies
On a half-a-gram of yuck, you can't stop me

[Chorus: Future]
I don't want none but some boot up (woo)

Came in her mouth, are you hardcore? (yeah)
You get to give me an encore
They need to give me my own show
I done sold out on my own tour
I want the work when I [?]
I just need to see the cash first
I just need to see the bag first (bag)
I'ma get it, that my last word

But he ain't doin', I'm an outburst him

See that nigga, he a boss, baby
