[Verse 1: Bankroll Fresh]
This feeling I cannot explain
Never been in this position, man they say that love is pain
She tell a little fussin’ and fightin’, goin’ through the same old things
She tell that nigga keep on lettin’ me run the same old game
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
He ain’t going for that
Show you how a real nigga ‘posed to act
Show you what a real nigga ‘posed to do
Show you how a real nigga work a move
[?], Chanel, Jimmy Choo
Fuck it, got options, choose
Drop the top on the thing, just cruise
We stick together, baby girl we glue

[Hook: Bankroll Fresh & Shanell]
Hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses
When you gone, baby I miss you
When you gone, baby I miss you
I said hugs and kisses, man I miss you
Man I really miss you, man your hugs and your kisses
Hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses
When you gone, baby I miss it
When you gone, baby I miss it
All your hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses

[Verse 2: Shanell]
Boy I don’t want to lead you astray
Got a nigga, but something about him ain’t the same
You drive me crazy, ooh boy, the way you call my name
I be in church on Sunday morning with you on my brain
Got me juggling like I’m up in the circus train
Baby ooh, baby ahh, make me feel ashamed
So give me that gangster shit, what you working with?
Make me want take you home
Hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses
Boy I want to be your missus
Boy I want to be your missus
All my niggas got riches
And my nigga got a 401k
So this is what I got to say
You can be my thug nigga
In the street
But boy don’t get it twisted nigga
I’m keeping mister
Cause you know what you’re here for
Ain’t nothing different
And I know what I came for
Give me what I’m missing
All that is is

[Hook: Bankroll Fresh]
Hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses
When you gone, baby I miss you
When you gone, baby I miss you
I said hugs and kisses, man I miss you
Man I really miss you, man your hugs and your kisses
