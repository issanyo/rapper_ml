CHORUS:
Hype Yellow Phoenix
Got a bad bitch
She anemic
This ain't a remix
All of the money I need it
This is my season
Done with the sleepin and dreamin
Y’all niggas fiending
Thought we was done with hypebeasting?
Hype Yellow Phoenix
Got a bad bitch
She anemic
This ain't a remix
All of the money I need it
This is my season
Done with the sleepin and dreamin
Y'all niggas fiending
Thought we was done with hypebeasting?

Verse 1:
Up in my zone tryna figure it out
Most of these niggas out chasing clout
If they don’t feel it they feeling it now
I'm finding success and they asking me how
Tons of impressions they looking wow
They hate on a nigga cause I got that sound
Trust and believe the top where I'm bound
If you disagree then boy you a clown
Im Gone!
Make y'all niggas file chapter 7
I'm a god nigga better ask your reverend
Imma raise hell call it Armageddon
All up in my face boy stop asking questions

Bridge:
You could do your worst and it still wouldn't hurt
It's Vi$ionary you know that I put in work
Niggas talking crazy I'll check them out like a clerk
In my bag now best believe I’m in my Burke

CHORUS:
Hype Yellow Phoenix
Got a bad bitch
She anemic
This ain’t a remix
All of the money I need it
This is my season
Done with the sleepin and dreamin
Y'all niggas fiending
Thought we was done with hypebeasting?

Verse 2:
Bring it back
Count them stacks
Stay with goons
I Never lack
I’m going up yeah and
I'm never ever looking back
Do this for my city
And them boys back in the trap
No time to chill I can't relax
Cause I'm out here chasing bags
I’m the rap Adam Sandler
All y'all niggas snitch like Flanders
I got no time for the banter
Made your girl a happy camper
You got questions I got answers
Make these hits just like a hammer
Run this shit I'm the commander
Watch your mouth boy have some manners

CHORUS:
Hype Yellow Phoenix
Got a bad bitch
She anemic
This ain't a remix
All of the money I need it
This is my season
Done with the sleepin and dreamin
Y'all niggas fiending
Thought we was done with hypebeasting?
Hype Yellow Phoenix
Got a bad bitch
She anemic
This ain't a remix
All of the money I need it
This is my season
Done with the sleepin and dreamin
Y'all niggas fiending
Thought we was done with hypebeasting?
