[Hook]
I been ballin’ ballin’ ballin’ ballin’ ballin’
I done slam dunked and broke the rim
She keep callin' callin' callin' callin' callin'
But I’m cooled on her like a fan
Ever since a nigga cut them hoes off
I ain't been broke ever since
Ever since a nigga cut them hoes off
I ain't been broke ever since
Ever since a nigga cut them niggas off
I ain't been broke ever since
Ever since a nigga knocked the witness off
I ain't been to court ever since
Ever since a nigga found a good plug
I been richie rich ever since
Ever since a nigga found a good plug
I been richie rich every since

[Verse 1]
Every since a nigga cut that trifling bitch off
Dog it is what it is
Everyday finessing, juggin', hittin' licks
Young nigga get it how I live
Own mama told me gotta keep it on me cause it's rough by where I live
And a lot of niggas want me dead
No I can't go not period
Lot of bitches on me, diamonds dripping on me
Yeah Stakks some like a pimp'
Foreign whipping homie, got yo bitch up on me
And she blow the kid like a fan
Keep the cool lil homie, got the tool up on me
You’ll get cooked like a meal
I been ballin' major league on you rookie niggas
I ain't even got a deal
Cause I come from slangin' by the crib
Trapping out of where my grandma live
You wouldn’t understand how it feel
Not until they witness how it is
Not until you serve your auntie a bag of the water knowing it might kill her
Not until you get a hood trophy pulling up to the jets in a Bentley

[Hook]
I been ballin’ ballin’ ballin’ ballin’ ballin’
I done slam dunked and broke the rim
She keep callin' callin' callin' callin' callin'
But I’m cooled on her like a fan
Ever since a nigga cut them hoes off
I ain't been broke ever since
Ever since a nigga cut them hoes off
I ain't been broke ever since
Ever since a nigga cut them niggas off
I ain't been broke ever since
Ever since a nigga knocked the witness off
I ain't been to court ever since
Ever since a nigga found a good plug
I been richie rich ever since
Ever since a nigga found a good plug
I been richie rich every since

[Verse 2]
Now they saying Stakks do the most
Said fuck it, pulled up in a Ghost
But I came from serving out the Chevy
Pulling up on you niggas what you want?
Yeah I get 'em in, get 'em gone
OG gas bag by the load
And don’t hit my line 'bout no dime bag
Lowest I'ma go is a zone
You charge what you want when you got it
You do what you want when you cop it
My nigga I got it, so broke nigga what's in your wallet
Might fly your bitch right out to Cali and fuck her off pills in the valley
I smash off drank and I smash her off dank
Commas on commas, I make a deposit
And when I withdraw, think I’m robbin’ the bank
But it ain't all in the bank
30 on me right know, nigga that's for show money
Couple grand on some Balmains, that ain't no money
Blow some more on a Chanel bag that's your ho money
Y'all lil niggas so broke y’all don't even know money

[Hook]
I been ballin’ ballin’ ballin’ ballin’ ballin’
I done slam dunked and broke the rim
She keep callin' callin' callin' callin' callin'
But I’m cooled on her like a fan
Ever since a nigga cut them hoes off
I ain't been broke ever since
