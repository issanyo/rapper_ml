[Verse 1: Go Yayo]
I'm the realest nigga breathin', all my youngins heathens
Your bitch she suck the dick, a lot of spit, feel like she teethin', whoa
Bitches love to please me so I dog 'em for no reason
Sippin' Hi-Tech red like fuck the feds, I'm trappin' 'til they see me, ayy
Turn a buck to a bowl, cookin' dope, nigga out of north blow
In Lil Vegas servin' smoke, fuck nigga you a joke
Big racks like poke, big old thooka super soak
Your partner broke, what you broke
Fuck nigga play me, you know I'ma smoke
HoodFame Gang, gang a clique full of soldiers
All of my niggas they rogueish
Full of red, can't focus
Man fuck these rappers 'cause most of 'em bogus
Chuck E. Cheese, bitch I'm all about tokens
Killers on the way, big homie'll smoke him
Bitch I'm a boss, you a worker
Fuck with the gang and it's murder, ayy

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I hit the plug for the trap money
I bought a Rari with all hundreds
Flex on them, bitch I'ma ball on 'em
My shooters pull up and they all runnin'
Mama told me keep flexin'
I drop a grip on a necklace
Freak bitch named Alexis
I'm in LA and I'm sippin' Texas
Money don't make you real
I was juggin', fuck a deal
I got a bitch, cook the breakfast
Young nigga and I'm flexin' on' em
Masi, I'm doin' donuts
I might take your bitch like hold up
Look at my pockets, they swole up
F&N might hit you, get wet up
We only fuck with the real niggas
Back in the trap, got your bitch on the pill nigga
A broke bitch, I can't deal with you
All of my niggas official
We only fuck with the real niggas
Back in the trap, got your bitch on the pill nigga
A broke bitch, I can't deal with you
All of my niggas official

[Verse 3: Philthy Rich]
I say now money in the trap, money in the trap
He be sippin' Quali, I be sippin' Act
I fucked the bitch once but I won't run it back
She be blowin' up my phone, want me to take her back
Lil Moschino on my belt, see I be in designer
These jeans YSL, see that's another thousand
Seminary nigga right in front of housing
Got the Wraith parked outside, that's three hundred thousand
Look I pulled up in a foreign with the doors up
That broke bitch up on my dick, she ain't got no love
I remember back then she had her nose up
But all this money in the trap got me froze up, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Rockie Fresh]
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I be sippin' strong, these niggas sippin' tap
You can tell 'em it's a wrap, money in the trap, yeah
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I be sippin' strong, these niggas sippin' tap
You can tell 'em it's a wrap, money in the trap, yeah

[Verse 4: Neek Bucks]
All of these hundreds, I came up
Look at them niggas, they changed up
Look how them bitches, they played us
Money ain't never gon' change us
Vegas with Philthy, the top down
I can spend ten on a watch now
Caught me a lick for like five pounds
Young rich nigga, I'm on top now
LV's on the lime sweater
Capo just told me apply pressure
All winter did the Yachtmaster
New feathers for the Skydweller
I got the keys, the keys
I got your bitch on her knees
I got a trick up my sleeve, trap when it's twenty degrees, started off pitchin' the weed
Young nigga ballin', trap nigga what your bitch want
Lot of money out here, boy you broke, go and get some
Yeah, Harlem nigga with a chopper with him
Lot of shooters, gon' be hard to get him
Know them shooters gon' be probably with him
Only broke boys got a problem with him

[Verse 5: YBS Skola]
I got money in this shoebox, got them pounds up in the attic
Got that chopper for you hatin' ass niggas that want some static
Every day is hella traffic, shit we sell, they gotta have it
You know I stack that cabbage, runnin' up plays just to stash it
I'm gettin' it off the celly, takin' trips to Cali
Pullin' up on Philthy, hundred dollar jewelries
Still fucked up 'bout my nigga Fatman, found my nigga guilty
Told him on bro every day I'm gon' get that appeal B
Gettin' it out the corner store, grindin' hard, I wanted more
Trappin' hardly, that's for sure, trappin' out that Honda Accord
Now I got that big face Rollie on my wrist
Thirty thousand on this chain, your bitch wan' give me a kiss

[Verse 6: JDay]
I got money in the trap, oh yeah that bag comin'
You sent the wrong shooter, killed your crash dummy
I fuck his bitch on the first date, Baton Rouge be my birthplace
A lot of these niggas love to hate, so I let the chopper fuck up they face
Most of these niggas don't know they place
I'm gettin' mine, we not in a race
Gotta count and chase bank, I'm top notch, you low rank
So why would I complain?
Fuck what you think, I'm insane
These bitches, they know I'm the man
Do this for family and fans
Fuck a nigga with that fan, move through drums like a band
Got your bitch lifted on Lindsay Lohan
I pop a perky then mix it with xans
When I be tooted nigga I get them bands up
Let me get it, slogan, that be my trance
One hundred up in that draco make 'em dance
One hundred up in that draco make 'em bands
Move through guns like a Taliban
Nigga know I be gone off the xans

[Chorus: Rockie Fresh]
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I be sippin' strong, these niggas sippin' tap
You can tell 'em it's a wrap, money in the trap, yeah
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I got money in the trap, money in the trap
I be sippin' strong, these niggas sippin' tap
You can tell 'em it's a wrap, money in the trap, yeah
