( Verse 1 )
Ribena
Ribena campur dengan Vodka and bakar Maria
Coz we the meanest sejambu Alia or Ila Damia
I call up my baby but korang panggil dia Mrs Akeem
Get money get money lu punya gua punya we split with the team
Ateda ateda jangan panggil brother kalau tak kenal
Kalau bukan pasal modal tak payahlah nak call my mobile
These rappers in copy dicopy  and copy and copy and copy
They nothing but baju and Jordans in limited edition topi

Curi awek lu depan-depan muka lu dah kena like tina
Kulit cokelat barang dia berat muka macam Latina
Seayu wanita but atas tilam dia memang betina
I spicko ka-ena raja macam emma kino dizarina
Don't buat karenah akeem and the panel you know gua terror
Hmm?
With money you talk kenapa nak borak
Sapu diorang licin cam kepala botak
Sinar macam carrot seadunan lobak
Haters muka monyong macam ikan todak
Eh wah ewah duit dah mula berselerak
They sayin I'm the shit
Siapa mintak kena berak
Sarung tshirt putih seluar camo masih segak
Flow sick takleh pulih barang gua dah merebak
Selu selu seludope
Selit barang seludope
Barang baik seludope
Susah datang? (yeah yeah)
Seludope (uhuh)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
That was saction what I'm sippin on
Purp drank, not lean
Not purp dank but we got green
But my eyes lean fuck vaccine
And with my team
Now you know we bought it
On the ground all day any day I cut it
Stroll to the day I gotta run it
Even when I run it
Ima stuck my hunnids on the motherfucking budget
Ribena
Ribena campur dengan angsa kelabu woke up and chill at the marina
Orang lain suka campur dengan red bull
But I keep it real macam with livita
Still in the viva
Baru cuci tapi masih bau cam sativa
Siapa pulak korang semua ni
Aku tak kenalmu macam korus Zamaera
Get money get money get money
Cari makan macam haiwan hari-hari
You hustle at night after work
Tapi studio session lu gua sailang dari pagi
Trying to get in with this paper
You trying to get to the office on time
On the 22s in the spot
That's what I call double crossin the line
Do you wanna get a little bit of this K?
And I ain't talking about white powder
Three rounds in the v
Call that white power
I'm a pro that's logic
Got it in the back fruity loops
I milk it
I milk it for real, kid
Got that mango roll
That's a fruity loop
Bring it back
Bring it back
Dinosaurs
If you got a good bag
My guy's the source
I'm talking about a kush bag
Not Michael Kors
Ticking louder than Nicki or Tyga Raws at
I don't care if you don't get it
Coz I get it I get it
When you talk about hip hop and in MY
Motherfucker, my name is embedded
I've been in this room for a minute
But somehow they move for five years in a row
People keep asking about me for caprice
But we've been cool sinc   e three years ago
Sometimes I'm impressed by my own shit
Coz I feel like it doing all ready
They asking me when the album drop
I tell em "I'll drop when you all are ready"
I'm trying to sell out arenas
You happy by just playing the bars
No disrespect to Jin
But i've been raising the bar
From SG to MY
Budak Jahat
Bujang Lapok
Akeem and Kenobi
We are so ill
Semua kedai habis jual ubat batuk
