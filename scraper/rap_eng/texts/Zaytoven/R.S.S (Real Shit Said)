Verse 1
I've been hurt I've seen the worse Im living with a curse
I've tried to fight my demons yet they spawn right out the dirt
I swear they keep looking up at me like I'm in a skirt
Every time I seem to turn around they all disperse
My backs against the wall who the fuck do I just call
Countless times I asked for yall but in the end yall watched me fall
This is real shit said id be better off dead I'm so lost in the sauce Ima zombie in my head
I'm just fed up with my life I can't seem to do right why I'm spilling how I feel cause im alone again tonight
I can't compete with a Porsche that has the power of a horse if I could I would just know I care about you girl
I made mistakes that done cost me
Done things that were costly
Escaped a drive by I'm lucky I ain't get caught b
Forever I'll be tainted you see the blood that has faded
Why I'm so adjacent complacent as well as patient
2016 really screwed me like a screwdriver
Ever since then I've been to trying to re ignite like a forest fire
Adding to the flame I guess gasoline ain't the multiplier
I need a intermission so I could find me a new supplier

Bridge
I've been contemplating whether I should stick to this music
Whole time it's the only reason I ain't abusive
Boy this shit fucking saved me while these streets raised me
Ain't no way to phrase it man this shits freaking crazy

Hook

Trynna rope a dope buy some time and just stall
You don't know me roughtweiler I am dog
I'm tired of this shit i swear that's on god

Verse 2
My living situation has been kinda hectic
I swear to fix this issue Ima need a medic
I ain't seen my mom in a long while
I wonder what she's been doing she ain't been on file
Shit ain't been the same since my grandpa died
Ever since you left my wings were clipped I can't fly
Only time I feel alive is when I'm on stage
It's as if my heart starts beating once the beat gets played
I feel a gap between this shit its as if it was a gage
I can't stand these rappers on hearing em fills my rage
Ive been stressed out snapping
Back pack rapping smoking cancer sticks to calm my levels I swear this shits devil
