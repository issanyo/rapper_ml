[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
If you a fuck nigga I can't fuck with you
Don't care if I just met you or grew up with you
If yous a bad bitch lil mama then wassup with you
I wanna pick you up, smoke one and go have lunch with you
All of my niggas, my niggas forever
All of my bitches, my bitches forever
Now we in together, but she do whatever I tell her
Got work on the scale and the chopper on the dresser
I pour up the drank and don't measure
Stack paper just for pleasure
Ain't nothing but dollar signs across my whole schedule
Nowadays you can't pay a nigga to keep it real
I'm kicking niggas up out the spot like I'm Uncle Phil

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I'm smokin', I'm countin', I'm drankin', I'm plottin'
I'm smokin', I'm countin', I'm drinkin', I'm plottin'
I'm smokin', I'm countin', I'm drinkin', I'm plottin'
I'm smokin', I'm countin', I'm drinkin', they watchin'
I'm smokin', I'm countin', I'm drinkin', I'm plottin''
I'm smokin', I'm countin', I'm drinkin', I'm plottin''
I'm smokin', I'm countin', I'm drinkin', I'm plottin''
I'm smokin', I'm countin', I'm drinkin', they watchin'

[Verse 2]
I'm staling, they watchin'
My style they copy, they hating but they can't stop me
Pull up on yo bitch get some sloppy
Got 20 bitches in the lobby, we bout to have a slumber party
Young nigga all about the profit, do I give a fuck, hardly
Fell asleep throw it on the drink, woke up next to a barbie
Jumped out the bathroom, my clothes on, grab my strap then I'm outtie
Live everyday like its friday, get high at dinner [?] multiply it
Real gangsta move in silence, smoking kush on the island

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I'm smokin', I'm countin', I'm drankin', I'm plottin'
I'm smokin', I'm countin', I'm drinkin', I'm plottin'
I'm smokin', I'm countin', I'm drinkin', I'm plottin'
I'm smokin', I'm countin', I'm drinkin', they watchin'
I'm smokin', I'm countin', I'm drinkin', I'm plottin''
I'm smokin', I'm countin', I'm drinkin', I'm plottin''
I'm smokin', I'm countin', I'm drinkin', I'm plottin''
I'm smokin', I'm countin', I'm drinkin', they watchin'
