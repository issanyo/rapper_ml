[Intro]
Nessly, and ZayTiggy yeah
Nessly, and ZayTiggy yeah

[Verse 1]
Freak ho, keep my address on the low
I don't trust her and I put that on my soul
She the reason I keep plastic on my sofa
I keep the stick inside a safe behind a poster
Yeah, rock band, I'ma buy a rock band
I'm rockin' Raf Simmons bitch, I ain't Gene Simmons bitch
Uh, all these hoes want to give me a kiss
I don't trust a motherfuckin' soul, I keep my shit long distance
Main bitch live in the past, main bitch live in the past
Your main bitch live with her parents, man that bitch so embarrassin'
Picked her up from her college, red Ferrari like Ferris
I claimed your bitch on my taxes, the lil bitch like a charity

[Pre-Chorus]
You gave her a ring but she wanna marry me
She wanna sing, told her come sign to me
A box of Fergie, and a lot of codeine
Whole lotta lean, whole lotta lean, whole lotta lean
All this cash will fuck up your lil self esteem
You would get on one knee for that bitch, she get on two for me
Leave the dealer, two Ferrari's like it's buy one get one free
Copped two, I ball like Lonzo, on Rodeo shooting threes

[Chorus]
Yeah, ball like I ain't got no bills, nah for real
I ball like I ain't got no bills, nah for real
Nah for real
Lonzo Ball!
Like Lonzo Ball
Big Ball, yeah, ayy

[Verse 2]
Committing sins, I kill them down in Saint Laurent
Since I was young I flipped that dough like Papa John's, yeah, yeah
Red marinara Maserati on my way to Panera Bread
I don't do no dodge ball in gym class but I'm dodging feds
Put the seat back in the Porsche Panamera, look like an ostrich bed
Made a good girl to a bad bitch, all she took was one percocet
Private chef in the crib, privates in your bitch mouth
Bitch say she wanna see a hundred grand, I'ma go and stick my wrist out
Two bitches, one coming, one leaving, I'ma let these hoes switch out
Four bands on a Moncler, all this ice made 'em think it's brick out
Whole lotta lean, whole lotta lean, like I signed to Swishahouse
Fucked a rich bitch, she told me pick somethin' out
If she don't come with benefits, I'ma come then dip
Bitch I'm petty and I'm pretty, I'ma fuck her friend

[Pre-Chorus]
You gave her a ring but she wanna marry me
She wanna sing, told her come sign to me
A box of Fergie, and a lot of codeine
Whole lotta lean, whole lotta lean, whole lotta lean
All this cash will fuck up your lil self esteem
You get on one knee for that bitch, she get on two for me
Leave the dealer, two Ferrari's like it's buy one get one free
Copped two, I ball like Lonzo, on Rodeo shooting threes

[Chorus]
Yeah, ball like I ain't got no bills, nah for real
I ball like I ain't got no bills, nah for real
Nah for real
Lonzo Ball!
Like Lonzo Ball
Big Ball, ayy
