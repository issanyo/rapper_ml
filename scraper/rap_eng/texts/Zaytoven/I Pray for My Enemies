[Intro]
Hail Father, which are in Heaven
Real street niggas appreciate each and every blessin'
Give us this day our daily bread
One time for all the homies in the feds
Forgive those that hate, for did they not know they sick with a disease
Yeah
Zaytoven
It's Dolph

[Chorus]
I'm drankin' lean and she drinkin' Hennessy (uh-huh)
Boujee bitch with pornstar tendencies (my favorite kind)
I put her on a plane to come and visit me (yeah)
Got time for her to go back, she don't wanna leave (she gotta go back)
Already know my haters sick of me (hey)
Real nigga, I pray for my enemies (ooh)
Real nigga, I pray for my enemies (ooh)
Trap nigga I came up 'bout sellin' P's (yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, kill 'em

[Verse 1]
I just left the trap, pulled up at her house (trap, skrrt)
Now she in my lap, no panties under blouse (ooh, woah)
She say, "Hol' up," she want me watch her make it clap (clap)
She used to have a nigga she met me and put him out (it's Dolph)
You see a real trap nigga, bitch, point him out (point him out)
I saw my first 100 pounds of weed and said, "Wow" (wow)
A 100 mill in ten years, now I'm thinkin' right now
The last three years, my main dawg been on the run (damn)
My lil' nigga right here with me, he just made bond (ayy)
She used to hold my palm, yes, she my day one (my sack, yeah)
And she fuck me good ever since day one (hey)

[Chorus]
I'm drankin' lean and she drinkin' Hennessy (uh-huh)
Boujee bitch with pornstar tendencies (my favorite kind)
I put her on a plane to come and visit me (yeah)
Got time for her to go back, she don't wanna leave (she gotta go back)
Already know my haters sick of me (hey)
Real nigga, I pray for my enemies (ooh)
Real nigga, I pray for my enemies (ooh)
Trap nigga I came up 'bout sellin' P's (yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt

[Verse 2]
I pray for my opps, my diamonds hopscotch (opps, jumpin')
I feel like I'm in the movie Belly and I'm Ox (Ox)
Just pulled up at the spot, now look what I just got (wet, hey)
I wake up in the morning and go buy my young nigga a drop (it's Dolph)
R.I.P. J Money, free all my niggas on lock (yeah)
They tried to do me like they did Kennedy (damn)
I ain't mad at cha, I pray for my enemies (I ain't mad at cha)
I learned how to weigh up dope, takin' chemistry (hey, hey)
2017 Dolph made history (it's Dolph)
All this fucking swag on me came from Italy (it's Dolph)
I been doin' this shit y'all niggas remember me (woo, ha, hey)

[Chorus]
I'm drankin' lean and she drinkin' Hennessy (uh-huh)
Boujee bitch with pornstar tendencies (my favorite kind)
I put her on a plane to come and visit me (yeah)
Got time for her to go back, she don't wanna leave (she gotta go back)
Already know my haters sick of me (hey)
Real nigga, I pray for my enemies (ooh)
Real nigga, I pray for my enemies (ooh)
Trap nigga I came up 'bout sellin' P's (yeah, yeah)
