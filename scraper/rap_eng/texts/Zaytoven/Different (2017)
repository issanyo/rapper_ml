[Intro: Yo Gotti]
Zaytoven
Aye life's crazy man, like
It's crazy how like, motherfuckers treat you different
Material shit, accomplishments, you namsayin'

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Aye, I got a hit they start treatin' me different
Been had that bag so it didn't make a difference
Yeah, in the beginning, she tried to keep her distance
I got the pussy she started treating me different (yeah, yeah)
They had their hand out but I ain't submissive
You tryin' to extort a nigga, I'm from Memphis
You know we mob different
Red or blue it don't make a difference
I flip that white to get that green
Them my only intentions (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
On Twitter better get out my mentions
I'm paranoid I'm shootin', you flinchin'
Nigga, I'm from the trenches
My bag different
My swag different
My bitch went seen Dr. Miami, her ass different
I'm extraordinary young nigga, I'm past different
This little bullshit you doin' young nigga, my past history
Talking indictments I done duck those
Bricks I seen truckloads
Snootie Wild [?] I took Snootie where our shit go
All I know is yayo
All I know is Dracos (brrt)
Bricks stacked up like Legos
All my dogs on payroll
Gotti chain shine harder, his shit VVS
My life can't get no harder boy, I survived the Crest

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
I got a hit they start treatin' me different (different)
Been had that bag so it didn't make a difference
Yeah, in the beginning, she tried to keep her distance (bitch)
I got the pussy she started treating me different (yeah, let's get it)
They had their hand out but I ain't submissive (fuck 'em)
You tryin' to extort a nigga, I'm from Memphis
You know we mob different (brrt)
Red or blue it don't make a difference (it don't make a difference)
I flip that white to get that green
Them my only intentions (yeah, shit ain't the same)

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I'm talkin' loyalty, you talkin' different (different)
Ungrateful niggas
I don't get it, you must define it different (different, yeah, ungrateful niggas)
Change nigga lives (lives)
Made niggas buns (buns)
You sold your niggas dreams (you did?)
Gave your niggas guns (damn)
I might not pay through these bills
But I told her what was real
Shorty you bad, that's cool but you gotta get some skills (facts)
See I pay different taxes (shit different)
That's a different bracket (shit different)
I hate when these niggas be talkin'
I wanna see the action
Wanna be the new Gotti
You ain't a fuckin' fraction (ain't a fraction)
You closer to being a Kardashian
You do not roll with assassins
I hate to see the cycle of niggas on their cycle
Talkin' 'bout haters when they act just like 'em
Ain't none of you niggas righteous (y'all different)

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
I got a hit they start treatin' me different (different)
Been had that bag so it didn't make a difference
Yeah, in the beginning, she tried to keep her distance (bitch)
I got the pussy she started treating me different (yeah, let's get it)

You gotta know the difference (yeah)
I hate when niggas compete with niggas out their league
Or niggas in their squad
You niggas act like broads

[Outro: Yo Gotti]
See I can tell pussy niggas when I see 'em
I can tell envious niggas when I see 'em
Ain't nothing worse than an ungrateful nigga though (namean')
How you real when you broke, but when you up you ain't
That mean you weren't real from the start, nigga (haha)
You niggas must remember money don't make you, heart do
We different
