[Intro: Future]
Smell good
What type of perfume you got on my love
What good perfume you wear Misses, my love
Is that.. Laurent
Smell like.. Money

[Hook: Future]
I'm true to the game, and fuck all that playin'
You see where I came from
Got that dope in my hand, they try to jump out the van
You know where I came from
That 30-round clip, fuck all that playin'
You know where I came from
Chevy Impalas and Regals, Man
23 bricks in a speaker, Man
You know where I came from

[Verse 1: Future]
The Feds picked a couple niggas up
Now, we duckin' them Feds now
It's hard to come by some Actavis
Now we drinkin' that red now
Cocaine all on my scale now
Molly, that Miley, my scale now
I been gettin' at it since Juvenile
I used to trap out my Grandma's house
We get it poppin' on any corner
Pourin' the lean like it's straight Corona
I got the shit that the gutter feel
I got them pills make your brother kill
I done fucked 'round and took two of them
Never serve it at the house where your little one at
I serve my Auntie that water
Shit, I serve my Momma some water

[Hook: Future]
I'm true to the game, and fuck all that playin'
You see where I came from
Got that dope in my hand, they try to jump out the van
You know where I came from
That 30-round clip, fuck all that playin'
You know where I came from
Chevy Impalas and Regals, Man
23 bricks in a speaker, Man
You know where I came from

[Verse 2: Future]
Cutlass and Regal, the Carlo
And 'rari, that Benz, diablo !
I pull up in a Diablo
Money that mucho de nacho
Blood shot, eyes red
A couple guns, Iraq
Got a pretty young thing
Let her bang on the South Side of Chiraq
Got a pint of syrup and I pass it
I was re'in up with that plastic
Hundred round drum, I'm Bin Laden
Nigga, ridin' 'round in these Bally's
I fuck 'em up and I jugg in 'em
I fuck with these niggas to a minimum
I walk in a check and I talk a check

[Hook: Future]
I'm true to the game, and fuck all that playin'
You see where I came from
Got that dope in my hand, they try to jump out the van
You know where I came from
That 30-round clip, fuck all that playin'
You know where I came from
Chevy Impalas and Regals, Man
23 bricks in a speaker, Man
You know where I came from
I'm true to the game, and fuck all that playin'
You see where I came from
Got that dope in my hand, they try to jump out the van
You know where I came from
That 30-round clip, fuck all that playin'
You know where I came from
Chevy Impalas and Regals, Man
23 bricks in a speaker, Man
You know where I came from
