[Intro]
Uh-huh
Zaytoven
Uh-huh
Everything at stake at this point

[Chorus]
Don't know where to start
Just know it started hard (just know it started hard)
Ridin' with a charge, in this double-R
Prayin' I see tomorrow (I pray I see tomorrow)
The hood left me with scars, niggas turned fraud
Feel the pain all in my bars (I can still feel the pain)
Ice on me colder than my heart, different cars in my garage
Feel like money heal my scars (feel like money heal my wounds)
Feel like money heal my scars

[Verse 1]
If you take away all this fame, all this status, all my name
Strip the diamonds out these chains, I wonder who gon' remain
I was so hungry, seen my heart beat, what you know 'bout starving?
I got scars on my feet, from kickin' doors and robbin'
The lawyer fightin' charges, will they visit? probably
Commisary hardly
Yeah, if I overcome this setback I don't want to hear you sorry
You can't get a sentence in my million dollar story
I don't fuck with niggas, I got smoke with niggas, yeah yeah
Antisocial, I don't crack no jokes with niggas, yeah yeah
Something I learned 'bout the enemy, gotta keep 'em close to you, uh-huh
On the road, different shows
I move through these cities with all of my guards up

[Chorus]
Don't know where to start
Just know it started hard (just know it started hard)
Ridin' with a charge, in this double-R
Prayin' I see tomorrow (I pray I see tomorrow)
The hood left me with scars, niggas turned fraud
Feel the pain all in my bars (I can still feel the pain)
Ice on me colder than my heart, different cars in my garage
Feel like money heal my scars (feel like money heal my wounds)
Feel like money heal my scars

[Verse 2]
I had to beat the odds (I did)
I got to keep the rod (why you say that?)
I had enough of scars (of scars)
I do not let you 'flague
Got a Fendi band-aid across my heart
Tryna heal the scars with these clothes and cars
I don't need a bitch if she can't play her part
Since he playin' games make him bullet dodge
I cruise the city in this Wraith space, I say that 'cause it's stars in it
They say I sold my soul, I reply I put my heart in it
The talent I got God-given, hundred K some odds with me
Large with me, big bag on me, yeah, whoa-oh-oh
I had to go put my feelings up (where they go?)
I put them all in a Bentley truck (skrrt)
These niggas hollerin' and actin' tough (talkin')
Really be childish, sippy cup (toddler)
I'm in the loft with the semi tucked (right now)
I know they plottin' to hit me up (I know)
I know I don't express my feelings
Please forgive me, I

[Chorus]
Don't know where to start
Just know it started hard (just know it started hard)
Ridin' with a charge, in this double-R
Prayin' I see tomorrow (I pray I see tomorrow)
The hood left me with scars, niggas turned fraud
Feel the pain all in my bars (I can still feel the pain)
Ice on me colder than my heart, different cars in my garage
Feel like money heal my scars (feel like money heal my wounds)
Feel like money heal my scars

[Outro]
Feel like money heal my scars, feel like money heal my scars
Feel like money heal my scars, feel like money heal my scars
