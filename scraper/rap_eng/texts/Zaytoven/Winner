[Hook: Quavo]
Money stand ten feet tall
My niggas shooting on a call
I’m fucking bitches with my dogs
Feeling like a winner nigga
Feeling like a winner nigga
Feeling like a winner nigga
Feeling like a winner
Go hard in the summer, no top in the winter
My bitch is so bad and I know you can’t get her
I know you can’t get her
My bitch is so bad and I know you can’t get her
I know you can’t get her
My bitch is so bad and I know you can’t get her

[Verse 1: Chinx]
Hit him in the head, kill a body
Murder that pussy then I beat the body
Three different drugs, I’m as high as three pilots
No dirt on my nails, I just got them shits polished
We with them niggas that jack and do robberies
Me and Zack, we back to back in them ‘raris
Ride on them fuck niggas, talking Ducattis
Fresh up out the trap nigga, wrapping up the product
In here looking like a winner
My niggas hungry, you looking like dinner
You bitch gone bungee, you best to go get her
Young and we bugging, we thug with no filler
Left up out the dealer, went straight to put the tints on
Been made a million off the sprint phone
My bitch is bad, you won’t get her
That’s why she put you niggas in the friendzone
I see it, I like it, I buy it
That’s the type of shit my niggas been on
They love it when you’re going through the bullshit
But hate it when a nigga get his win on

[Verse 2: Quavo]
My bitch is so bad and I know you can’t get her
You tried to get her, she dismissed you
Drop my top in the winter, I grab a nipple
Now she telling me that I’m too physical
My niggas crazy, they gone get at you
Hollow tip, yes they do spit at you
You run in the trap, you know I wouldn’t do that
The bando, you know it get critical
I got so many arms and legs in the game, they say I got tentacles
Lil mama she after the fortune and fame, do you think that we not on to you?
Pull up, they liking you, no I’m not wifing you
The cameras they watching you
I know that she think she got [?] on you

[Verse 3: Offset]
I’m in your bitch’s mouth like a dental, you niggas is feminine, talking subliminal
Take her clothes off like a physical, yes I’m a criminal, chasing the Benjamins
Red on the bottom my Loubotin, I got two bitches, they eat up the lubricant
They got good brain, them bitches too intelligent
I live in the mansion, don’t live like the average
Lil mama she funny, she talking bout crossing the country
Lil mama can’t get nothing from me
I get the money and stretch it like bungees
Not talking bout stomach but I got the Tommy
Young rich nigga, I’m worth a whole milly
Yeah I pull up in ghosts and it scares you like Thriller
Shoot em like Reggie Miller
My bitches exquisite, my bitches expensive
Shout out to Chinx, we pull up with links
Them diamonds shining so hard, bitches gone blink
Bitches drinking semen like it’s a sink
It’s summertime, I still got on a mink
