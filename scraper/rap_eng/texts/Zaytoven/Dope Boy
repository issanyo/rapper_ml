[Intro-Gucci Mane]
(Zaytoven)
Dope boys
Dope boys stand up
Zaytoven

[Chorus-Gucci Mane]
Dope boys, dope boys, dope boys, dope boys
Dope boys, dope boys, dope boys, dope boys

[Verse 1-Project Pat]
I been hustling since a little nigga
Came up with some hood niggas
I done met a lot of fuck boys, done lost some good niggas
Money never make a man, but it'll make a man pull the trigger
Your best friend turn to snitch nigga
You can't reason with a fuck nigga
You sweet boy, tryna play hard
Went and bought some new sticks, 30 rounds in AR's
Racked up, blow a lot of paper
Foreign cars make a bitch wet
Jewels like I'm Dipset
Brick of Yeezy, that's some quick yay
My migo, he a gangsta, I call him hombre
Sauced up, I'm a wave god
Blocked up like the Trap God
Snitch nigga, you a bitch nigga, load up, I'mma play ya'll

[Chorus-Gucci Mane]
Dope boys, dope boys, dope boys, dope boys
Dope boys, dope boys, dope boys, dope boys

[Verse 2-Gucci Mane]
I pay a penny for your thoughts and leave your brains on the asphalt
Don't blame me, it's the cash fault
I throw rocks from a glass house
A trap house, a stash house
Rob your block, take the mask off
I don't need a hand out, but I might cut your hand off
I'm so Marilyn Manson
I'm so heinously handsome
I'm more dangerous than famous, I'll take your grandson for ransom
I might live a vamp life
That lady in the tramp
My bitch sleep all day, gold fangs like a vampire
Them niggas might find it odd, I wear my shades in the dark
And when I say I'm a god I still have faith in the lord
Know the Tonka's a sport
Be careful what you record
These men act like boys, they scared to cut off the cord

[Chorus-Gucci Mane]
Dope boys, dope boys, dope boys, dope boys
Dope boys, dope boys, dope boys, dope boys
