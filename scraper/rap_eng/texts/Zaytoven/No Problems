[Chorus: B.o.B]

Yeah I’m from the city swear it’s loud as hell
Niggas always talking tell em I don’t care
Balling so damn hard I tore my ACL
It’s way too many bitches I done smashed in here

Yeah I’m from the city swear it’s loud as hell
Niggas keep on talking tell em I don’t care
Ballin’ so damn hard I tore my ACL
Got all my niggas with me ain’t no problems here

[Verse 1: London Jae]
London wild, he a city nigga
Plenty paper, like a [?] nigga
Keep slime with me, he gon’ hit a nigga
Got lil cuz with me that’s a trigga nigga
I’m on boulevard, popping good flavor
Hit Cleveland, Bankhead
I’m in Decatur with Bobby nigga
Try my nigga, ima body niggas
Keep it 1 million, I’m solid nigga
Chain hanging like a chandelier
Bitches round a nigga drinkin liquor
Got a panoramic on a panomera
Leave a nigga in the cemetery
Piss and shit on your obituary
Call it February, boy I’m military
Magic got em pretty city bitches
Finally got a ratchet pretty bitch
Pretty pussy, plenty ass n titties
Roll it up and ima mash it with them
Saturday I’m up at mansion hanging with the savages
And I know the city like mine
With them bad bitches like mine
Try and it’ll take a whole lifetime to shine like I shine

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Yeah I’m from the city swear it’s loud as hell
Niggas always talking tell em I don’t care
Ballin’ so damn hard I tore my ACL
It’s way too many bitches I done smashed in here

Yeah I’m from the city swear it’s loud as hell
Niggas keep on talking tell em I don’t care
Ballin’ so damn hard I tore my ACL
Got all my niggas with me ain’t no problems here

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Stripper bitches always want to turn up
Stackin’ collard green cabbage yeah turn up
Chillin’ with a bitch you never heard of
Giving niggas with sloppy toppy with the [?] up
Shirt up, skirt up, word up, bandz
Extendo in my hand I got a short attention span
Yeah, we was down, I never doubted my team
Can you hear me packed as loud as can be
Nine thousand, nine hundred, ninety nine problems
I put in work like its ten thousand of me
Post up something, watch me blow up from it
Call it photobombing bet I’m holding something
Not a role model, got a smoking problem
Fuck the whole bible, drink the whole bottle
Niggas gossip, like the hoes gossip
Pockets be on Rosie O’Donnell
I just be preaching my own truths
The Bobby Ray version, the whole gospel
Can I get a witness, I been through the trenches
Vicious rumors, turn to negative intentions
This ain’t rocket science, this ain’t quantum physics
This No Genre bitch, we smashing competition
Easy...bandz

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Yeah I’m from the city swear it’s loud as hell
Niggas always talking tell em I don’t care
Ballin’ so damn hard I tore my ACL
It’s way too many bitches I done smashed in here

Yeah I’m from the city swear it’s loud as hell
Niggas keep on talking tell em I don’t care
Ballin’ so damn hard I tore my ACL
Got all my niggas with me ain’t no problems here
