I'm Cappin shoes cost about 10
Hunnid dollar bills and I'm riding in that nasty
Dragin', racin' in traffic
Bitches say they bad bitches, weak bitches average
I'm Cappin, Cappin, Cappin, Cappin, I'm cappin, Blood Cap
This for Blood and Cap, Blood and Cap, this for Blood and Cap

[Verse 1]
This for Cap this for Blood, ridin round with my thud
G-L-O G-A-N-G we not with that giving up
Don't expect me to give you hug
Bullets coming fill you up
Oreo Double Stuffed, Nigga get yo feelings hurt
Boy I got that Pizza Hut, Giordanos which one you want?
Get that Grezielda Blanco like
"Aye lil Pablo where da fuck ya goin?"
In the club froze I bought the bar I dont even want it
I don't drink no alcohol I be drinking that lean I'm snoring

Gambino grab my meatroll
Aye Tadoe grab my K doe
Aye Justo make sure Benji straight, folks think he in Barbados
Niggas wanna try me let the K blow
Wtf Chief Sosa waiting for?
Got pink birds lookin' like Flamingos
She dust my shoes off like I'm Fabo
Keep racks in my pockets everyday tho
Inna cap center and I'm Cappin spending all the play-doh
Choppa have him boppin' like he dancin' with Kemo
Off the car lot I'm smashing I'm riding like an A-hole
Remember on the block shooting up niggas Limo's
Now my birthday is every damn day tho
Wonder how I got the racks in my jeans?
Cause I be working every day tho
