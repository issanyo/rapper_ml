[Hook: Rich The Kid & Fetty Wap]
I gotta keep it 100
Bitches, they fuckin' for nothin'
Pull up in my truck in the front
Rich but I started with nothin'
I'm in the trap with a bad bitch
Had to go flood out my whole wrist
Too many cars in the garage
I'm thankin' Allah
These niggas, they fake and they fraud

I gotta keep it 100
Most of these niggas is bluffin'
I hit 'em man, they be frontin'
They do not keep it 100
Shootin' at niggas in broad day
My niggas they trap out the hallways
This money shit, we get it all day
I keep it 100, as always

I gotta keep it 100
Bitches, they fuckin' for nothin'
Pull up in my truck in the front
Rich but I started with nothin'
I'm in the trap with a bad bitch
Had to go flood out my whole wrist
Too many cars in the garage
I'm thankin' Allah
These niggas, they fake and they fraud

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Most of these niggas, they snakes
I sip the lean, pour a 8th
So many diamonds the bezel won't break
I know that your Rollie is fake
These bitches gon' fuck, can't trust 'em
I can turn nothin' to somethin'
How many times have I told you?
I'm trappin' the block
I'm servin' in front of the cops
I talk about Rari's, I'm flexin' in them
I don't got no friends
I gotta go get them M&Ms
I got Juelz like Dipset and 'em
Bitch you lyin', ain't got no time
Back then  I was broke but now I got cash
I'm gettin' to the money, the fuck is you mad?
I might just go break in her bag

[Hook: Rich The Kid & Fetty Wap]
I gotta keep it 100
Bitches, they fuckin' for nothin'
Pull up in my truck in the front
Rich but I started with nothin'
I'm in the trap with a bad bitch
Had to go flood out my whole wrist
Too many cars in the garage
I'm thankin' Allah
These niggas, they fake and they fraud

I gotta keep it 100
Most of these niggas is bluffin'
I hit 'em man, they be frontin'
They do not keep it 100
Shootin' at niggas in broad day
My niggas they trap out the hallways
This money shit, we get it all day
I keep it 100, as always

I gotta keep it 100
Bitches, they fuckin' for nothin'
Pull up in my truck in the front
Rich but I started with nothin'
I'm in the trap with a bad bitch
Had to go flood out my whole wrist
Too many cars in the garage
I'm thankin' Allah
These niggas, they fake and they fraud

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
I gotta keep it 100
ZooGang the camp, Zoovier, I run it
And I came up from nothin'
I'm livin' good, my bitches love me
Niggas after my money
I introduce 'em to my Tommy
Keep my shooters close to me
You can never run behind me
I be rollin' that dope
Sack like a mothafuckin' zombie
I been juugin' so good
Might drop a 100 on my time piece
And we keep it 100
I don't want no awards
I don't want no Grammy's
You get left for a check
Boy I just hope you understand me (Yeah, baby) (squad)

[Hook: Rich The Kid & Fetty Wap]
I gotta keep it 100
Bitches, they fuckin' for nothin'

These niggas, they fake and they fraud

I gotta keep it 100

They do not keep it 100
Shootin' at niggas in broad day

I'm in the trap with a bad bitch
Had to go flood out my whole wrist
Too many cars in the garage

These niggas, they fake and they fraud
