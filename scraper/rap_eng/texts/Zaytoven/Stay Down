[Hook: Young Dolph]
Never gave a fuck 'bout a nigga or a bitch
Never gave a fuck about nothin' but gettin' rich
Stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down
Stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down
You lovin' these bitches, I just love my gwala
You lovin' these bitches, I just love my gwala
Stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down
Stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
I sit down on my money bank
Being broke ain't funny, man
Sucker chasin' bitches not the bread you's a dummy man
Chopper to the stomach, man
That sack you can run it, man
Hustlin' in the rain, so my days will be sunny, man
Money train, we hit the lotto
Dolph got me on that Gelato
Sippin' lean, [?] so a lame gon' get shot in the face
All my homies on them apes
Hustle cookies, rob for cakes
Draco is the lawnmower, that's gon' weed out you snakes
Might just have to beat the brakes
Shoot some shit up, show my ass
Put that tone in my hand with the mesh, you know my past
Bitch ass niggas don't get no pass
Bitches eatin' up dick for cash
I wanna control her mind, you wanna control her ass

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Never gave a fuck 'bout a nigga or a bitch
Never gave a fuck about nothin' but gettin' rich
Stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down
Stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down
You lovin' these bitches, I just love my gwala
You lovin' these bitches, I just love my gwala
Stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down
Stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Never gave a fuck 'bout a nigga or a bitch
Never gave a fuck about nothin' but gettin' rich
Never will I cross my dawg out for a dollar
Jumped out the Chevelle and hopped in the drop-top Impala
Put that pistol in his face, let's see how loud how he holla
You lovin' these bitches, I just love my gwala
My finger, wrist and neck iced out, drippin' water
She looked at my pinky ring, then told me she like to swallow
Everybody sell dope and keep a gun where I'm from
I'm drankin' on Hi-Tech and my lil' she drinkin' rum
Crack a seal of Hi-Tech
Drank a pint with Project
Rockin' dopeboy Jordans and I keep that Houston Rocket

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Never gave a fuck 'bout a nigga or a bitch
Never gave a fuck about nothin' but gettin' rich
Stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down
Stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down
You lovin' these bitches, I just love my gwala
You lovin' these bitches, I just love my gwala
Stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down
Stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down
