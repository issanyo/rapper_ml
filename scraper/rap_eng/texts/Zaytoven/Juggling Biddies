[Verse 2: Riff 3x]
Woke up early on some gangsta shit (gangsta shit)
Told my bitch to bend it over and take the dick (take the dick)
Gotta get it by all means, that’s why I chase them nigs
Cigarillo full of kush (woo), and I look like a light
Keep it fresh like a mint when I ride behind tint
I used to dream about ballin’, now I swish on you hoes
I went and got me a bag (woo, woo) and draped my body in gold (body in gold)
Sold my soul to a pot ‘cause I'm re-rockin' them Os
I stay down and committed, that’s why I die by the pennies (I die by the pennies)
I been hustlin’ all night (ugh), tryna get me a milli (get me a milli)
Got to keep a strap all time when you be dealin’ (yeah)
‘Cause niggas get in they feelings when they ain’t 'bout they business (that right)
