[Chorus:]
My nigga bitch trippin still won't let him see his kid,he took that bitch to court wit it
I know a nigga used to struggle for a long time,I just left a boat with him, yeah
I know a bitch who used to struggle for a long time,and she still just a broke bitch, damn!
You did some gangster shit on the street then you testify
To me you a fuck nigga no gangsta!

[Verse 1:]
To me yous a fuck n*gga
I know the real side of you of you
So I cannot fuck with you
Any bitch I deal with feel, like I love strippers
Judo camedo much about a widow who goin in the hood
I told her to appreciate it but you know I love liquor dude
Dude that bitch that walk around here with the camel toe
Any situation we done let them hammer go
It ain’t no dumping on no n*ggas ain’t going out back
Been bitching a lot lately man I goin to burn your ass
My it’s on like a geisha you see it on glass
Summertime goin to have his ass out on the motorpass
How you can’t salute that man
He trying to be a dad
Doin good he out remember trying [?]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Quarter mill in the safe
I guess that’s why these pussy n*ggas hatin
Money bring envy
N*ggas start faking
Claiming that they real
Praying you don’t make it
Claiming that you’re a gangster but you testify
Well from you rep you gotta die
Bitches shaking ass got a n*gga hypnotized
I make it rain on the bitch I call it paying time
Cross school mother fucker know I’m gonna grind
One call it’s a mother fucker homicide
Hunned shots sizes up the four door
Touch my n*gga I’m turning Rambo

[Chorus]
