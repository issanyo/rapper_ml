[Chorus]
Bitch I feel like Bruce, Batmobile like Bruce
Black on black my main ho, velvet on my shoe
Robin he gon' shoot, wait, Harley Quinn my boo
Bitch I feel like Bruce Wayne, Batmobile my coupe
Bitch I feel like Bruce, Batmobile like Bruce
Black on black my main ho, velvet on my shoe
Robin he gon' shoot, wait, Harley Quinn my boo
Bitch I feel like Bruce Wayne, Batmobile my coupe

[Verse]
Play my cards like Joker do, got chips just like poker do
Hater blocker, peek at you, canary look like Pikachu
Your bitch way too close to me, she say she been way over you
No you can't get shit from me, see right through me like curtains do
Bitch I'm headed to the top and that shit been way overdue
My neck look like Mr. Freeze, okay ho this ain't nothin' new
Ninety-five, that's on my feet and my bitch born in '92
Gold grills they all in my mouth and your shit lookin' kinda fool

[Chorus]
Bitch I feel like Bruce, Batmobile like Bruce
Black on black my main ho, velvet on my shoe
Robin he gon' shoot, wait, Harley Quinn my boo
Bitch I feel like Bruce Wayne, Batmobile my coupe
Bitch I feel like Bruce, Batmobile like Bruce
Black on black my main ho, velvet on my shoe
Robin he gon' shoot, wait, Harley Quinn my boo
Bitch I feel like Bruce Wayne, Batmobile my coupe
