[Hook]
I say these hoes ain't shit, I ain't tripping on no thot
I don't like conversations, you gone let me fuck or not
While these niggas sneak dissing, I'll be touring getting gwop
I be flexing on these suckas, pulling up in foreign drops
These hoes say I'm too much, I think I'm too much
A nigga try Almighty Sosa he get touched
These hoes be tryin' too much, doing too much
Bitch I couldn't call your phone, I was doing too much

[Verse 1]
They say I smoke too much
Lean too much
T-Roy my shooter and he will shoot ya
I put Tadoe in the cut Fredo was in it too much
If you ain't on that opp shit than we salute ya
I get money too much
Spend it too much
And if you try to take it then my niggas shoot ya
When I throw it in the air these hoes be doing too much
When we leave it be too many hoes up on the tour bus
I just got Kay Kay a check we finna hit Toys R Us
Spent 20 thousand dollars think I bought her too much
I just got Kay Kay a check we finna hit Toys R Us
Spent 20 thousand dollars think I bought her too much
