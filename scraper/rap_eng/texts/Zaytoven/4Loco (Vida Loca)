I never hang with the broke ass
Hang with the plug I got more ties
Hop in the coupe with your frog eyes
Suck on my dick make her jaw tired
I got your bitch in my archive
We pull out the stick and they all die
We really came up on egg beans
Walkin' around with them dead people
When I drive don't see to scare people
I got a thot in the Bentley
Hittin' the light, droppin' the bag on [?]
Yellin' out fuck the cops
Before I had pop
Mama said boy you a star
I wish you could see all the guap (cash)
Callin' mi casa [?] it fell out the pockets I think [?]
Open the car then money start budgin' the shit really lookin' retarded
I know that them nigga a target I pull out the foo-foo [?] the budget
Bitch, I'm the cap' and the sergeant (captain)
The block is on fire I'm a ocean
Wrappin' the brick with a turban (wrap it up)
Then they go seat in the Austin (Texas)
Hop in the Wraith, it's a coffin' (Wraith)
Bitch, I'm the boss who you bossin' (boss)
Bitch, I'm the sauce you got lost in (sauce)
Cookin' up my Monica Kaufman (cookin' up)
