[Intro]
I don't get it, gotta keep it pimpin' man
Sauce is not just about money
That's too much sauce
It's a way of life
Too much sauce

[Hook]
Took your bitch the main one
That's too much sauce
Claiming something and rename 'em
That's too much sauce
You put diamonds all over her fingers
That was too much sauce
She gone with the roof put down
That's too much sauce
That's too much sauce
That's too much sauce
That's too much...
That's too much sauce
Took your bitch the main one
That's too much sauce
She gone with the new dude now
That's too much sauce

[Verse 1]
All of my diamonds legit, All of my bitches are solid
I send a bitch with a ball player, she gon call me up later and send a deposit
A lotta these niggas be wildin, fighting with your girlfriend for cheating you [?] She breaking your phone it ain't private, that shit beaten all on you, you know your bitch ballin Yeah Yeah
Wait
Thats too much sauce
You are not drippin just cause you dress nice
That is not your hoe boy that is your wife
You know damn well you know about this life
Sauce ain't about looking for girlfriends
Sauce about drippin for benjamins
Teaching these bitches a better plan
Giving these bitches a helping hand
Married to money no wedding man
Bitches love me together they understand
Never leave me for a better man
Im all these bitches forever man

[Hook]
Took your bitch the main one

Thats too much sauce
Thats too much sauce
Thats too much sauce
Thats too much
That was too much sauce

[Verse 2]
Kissing on sluts in your videos, that is not drippin now really thou
That is not dripping now really bro, That ain't be drippin be pimpin
That ain't be pimpin be pimpin
Kissing this bitch for attention she suck for a living
On top of that you is spinning, puttin your lips on this bitch i see why your wife trippin
She ain't even breaking digits, And you been fucking this bitch bringing her where you be living
Shes thinking where is the loyalty
If you a king with a royalty
My bitches set like theres 4 of me
And i would not lay with a bitch for the free
Can't lay with a bitch that do not believe
That tennis shoe money is not for me
That stress and depressed life is not for me
Less than 2 women is not for me
We can all be a big family

[Hook]
Took your bitch the main one
Thats too much sauce

She gone with the roof put down
Thats too much sauce
Thats too much sauce
Thats too much sauce
Thats too much
Thats too much sauce
Took your bitch the main one
Thats too much sauce
You put diamonds all over her fingers
That was too much sauce
