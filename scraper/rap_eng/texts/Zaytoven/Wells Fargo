[Pre-song]
Weigh in, weigh out, day in, day out
I'm the Flippa, an' the shooter, I know you hidin'
Ima run you down bitch like a boy scout

[Hook]
Plug send me four Migos, said the peas flying in and out the stash in the cargo
Told little mama touch the dope, serve a j
And save one if he comes back tomorrow
Diego put me on Hector
Hector got knocked off the day I met Carlos
Flew to Tijuana just to re-up, threw the money on the table, call me Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo
Got a Cuban plug, he don't remix the drugs
But let's keep that on the d-low
Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo
All the bricks come triple wrapped up
Og gas bag zipped up with official bar codes

[Verse 1: Skippa Da Flippa]
Bando be bumping, real Offset, Takeoff, Quavo stuntin'
Finessing the plug with dummies
Count a half a mil with my nigga Rel Money
Weigh in, weigh out, day in, day out
I'm the Flippa, an' the shooter, I know you hidin'
Ima run you down bitch like a boy scout
Bando never had a drought
Millions in the ceiling, chickens in the couch
If you matching transactions for 3
Then I'm re-rocking an ounce, you won't come out the house
You can use debit or credit
You can jugg with the way I said it
Made a killing of capping when I was trapping
In Orlando taking more three's than J.J. Redick

[Hook]
Plug send me four Migos, said the peas flying in and out the stash in the cargo
Told little mama touch the dope, serve a j
And save one if he comes back tomorrow
Diego put me on Hector
Hector got knocked off the day I met Carlos
Flew to Tijuana just to re-up, threw the money on the table, call me Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo
Got a Cuban plug, he don't remix the drugs
But let's keep that on the d-low
Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo
All the bricks come triple wrapped up
Og gas bag sent dope with official bar-code

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Wells...Fargo, Quavo...Migos
Head...honcho, (Glaaw) Rambo
I hop on the jet, I throw up my set, I land in Quebec
I'm selling a brick, I'm selling a brick, I'm flipping the check
Know what it is, you know what it ain't
I'm trapping and capping the stank
That west-side, you need a green dot, then cop a new shank
Shout out my plug, incredible plug, my nigga Armando
I'm stacking the dub, the fifty, the hundred, a way to Wells Fargo

[Hook]
Plug send me four Migos, said the peas flying in and out the stash in the cargo
Told little mama touch the dope, serve a j
And save one if he comes back tomorrow
Diego put me on Hector
Hector got knocked off the day I met Carlos
Flew to Tijuana just to re-up, threw the money on the table, call me Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo
Got a Cuban plug, he don't remix the drugs
But let's keep that on the d-low
Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo
All the bricks come triple wrapped up
Og gas bag sent dope with official bar-code

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
All the bricks come whipped up, wrapped up
Packed up, sent out with official bar-code
On the stove with the coco, going loco, whip whipping up a whole brick of mayo
I be fucking, I be smashing all the hoes, they be calling me an European gigolo
Deuce Bigalow, when I'm running through your city, what you snitching fo'
I heard that they call you Wells Fargo because you got M&Ms stuffed in your cargo
I'm walking around, I got red on my shoe and it's red on my car, Eldorado
Plug send me ten Migos in the caravan, kick-stand, Molly Santan
I'm in the bando breaking down pure dope
3 AK's like the Klu Klux Klan

[Hook]
Plug send me four Migos, said the peas flying in and out the stash in the cargo
Told little mama touch the dope, serve a j
And save one if he comes back tomorrow
Diego put me on Hector
Hector got knocked off the day I met Carlos
Flew to Tijuana just to re-up, threw the money on the table, call me Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo
Got a Cuban plug, he don't remix the drugs
But let's keep that on the d-low
Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo
All the bricks come triple wrapped up
Og gas bag sent dope with official bar-code
