[Hook]
Buy the car, buy the house, spending 'bout a thousand
Money stacked tall, trapping out the public housing
Buy the car, buy the house, spending 'bout a thousand
Money stacked tall, trapping out the public housing

[Verse 1]
Money stacked tall, dog, every day, I get it
Running through this public housing, trying to see a meal ticket
I ain't playing no soccer, so the Juice don't kick it
I only fuck with those trying to get to them digits
Old school '72 sitting on them Scottie Pippen's
Blowing bubba kush and red eye is how the Juice live it
You can catch me in the hood, dog, busting down chickens
With multicolored diamonds got me all the pretty women
Eating Pappadeaux sharktail, take your bitch by Denny's
Man, I'm booming off the chain, dog, and I really live it
Man, I'm cooking up the Yola, call it ice water whipping
I'm doing it with one hand like I'm at Benihanna, chilling
Infiniti truck on them Davin floaters, steady spinning
Getting to the money like I'm doing shows in cities
With precious cut diamonds same color as Officer Friendly
Young Juiceman, dog, you got to fuck with me

[Hook]
Buy the car, buy the house, spending 'bout a thousand
Money stacked tall, trapping out the public housing
Buy the car, buy the house, spending 'bout a thousand
Money stacked tall, trapping out the public housing

[Verse 2]
Every day's a struggle trying to get it out the city street
So I'm posted up in the kitchen whipping up a quarter key
Got to stay down cause the dividends excite me
Young Juiceman and that cocaine entice me
Sack to sack living, man, I had to get the yayo off
Trapping out a house with a Mac-90 and sawed-off
Pyrex and that fork, longevity has paid off
Now I'm busting down them chickens, booming with a payoff

[Hook]
Buy the car, buy the house, spending 'bout a thousand
Money stacked tall, trapping out the public housing
Buy the car, buy the house, spending 'bout a thousand
Money stacked tall, trapping out the public housing
