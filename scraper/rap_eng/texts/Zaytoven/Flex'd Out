[Hook x2: Chris Travis]
I'm flexed out, nigga get your checks out
About to hit the mall and buy the whole bitch out
Real shit, I don't give a fuck about shit now
I don't even wear jewelry, because that shit's out

[Verse 1: Chris Travis]
Bitch I'm on the internet and I'm making money
YouTube, Google shit broad band jumping
Everybody watching me like they want something
Get up off my dick unless your pussy tight and honest
Find me down in Memphis, prolly somewhere low-fi
Smoking big blunts prolly need two hands to hold it
I'm that nigga that you see up in your fucking dreams
Red diamonds dancing on me, watch the blood gling

[Hook x2: Chris Travis]

[Verse 2: Smug Mang]
I-i-i-it is Smug Mang, a.k.a. the Smug God
For the north I always been putting on
Shout out [?] because it influense me, especially mentally
Now it's about the flight from where I see Italy
Flexing at Smug? Boy you kiddery?
As if you a G, Water Boys is 18
We do our thang, prolly why your bitch keep on calling me

[Hook x2: Chris Travis]

[Verse 3: Black Kray]
Ah I'm turnt up, bitch I'm flexed out
Tell the south, all your men, bring your bitch out
Run them Tecs out, with the gold mouth
Broad nigga I'm really smart, can't talk now
[?] be on 26
These niggas set, Young Slick Rick
