[Intro]
Peephole (young nigga world)
Gotta serve you through the peephole
Feds out, gotta watch out for them narcos
Nigga, 6, gotta serve you through the peephole

[Chorus]
I'm paranoid so I gotta serve you through the peephole
Narcos, nigga watchin' out for them narcos
Gun smoke, pussy you don't really want no gun smoke
Row row, watch me rock your boat like a lil though

[Verse]
I'm 19 and I'm havin' dreams of that mansion
Gotta run a play from the line of the scrimmage
Life a gamble and I'm shakin' dice when I'm gamblin'
I'm a bastard child 'cause I grew up with no daddy
Window totin' guns, that shit is a bad habit
My bitch wanna be thick, gave her dick and some cabbage
When I hit the scene I be drippin' and I'm dabbin'
Hit her from the back, make that ho call me zaddy
Z stand for zoe, O stand for oaf
Your car stay on E, full throttle, I"m on go
Niggas act like bitches and I swear they do the most
I'm a real team player so they label me the coach
I was raised in the slums, it turned me to a bum
Finally gettin' bread, came from savin' up my crumbs
Smokin' all this gas, that shit hoggin' up my lungs
Nick Cannon drum line how I rock out with them drums

[Chorus]
I'm paranoid so I gotta serve you through the peephole
Narcos, nigga watchin' out for them narcos
Gun smoke, pussy you don't really want no gun smoke
Row row, watch me rock your boat like a lil though
I'm paranoid so I gotta serve you through the peephole
Narcos, nigga watchin' out for them narcos
Gun smoke, pussy you don't really want no gun smoke
Row row, watch me rock your boat like a lil though, 6
