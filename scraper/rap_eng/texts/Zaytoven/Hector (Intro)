[Intro]
I'm smoking cookie, drinking lean, and fucking bitches
Duffel bags, one with drugs, one got racks in it
A foreign bitch, I fell in love with her accent
While you were going to school, nigga, I was at the [?]

[Interlude]
Yeah, It's Zay
Hector Vol. 1 shit
Back on that bullshit
Fa'sho

[Verse]
Pineapple Fanta muddier than a bitch
It's a push-start when I'm sliding with your bitch
All of a sudden, you gangsta now
Same nigga called when they took your shit
You crossed the line, put you on the list
Don't start nothing, now you can't finish it
Get shot for some shit that you ain't mean it
I'm on the drugs every day, I'm addicted
One-on-one, nigga, be very persistent
Diamondback on me when I'm in the kitchen
When you're serving, gotta stay consistent
Ice on my neck, not to mention I'm juuging

[Outro]
Yeah, hey, yeah
Bloody stone compliment a nigga's pimping, yeah
Bloody stone compliment a nigga's pimping, yeah
DrugRixh, DrugRixh
