[Intro]
At least a M
(Mike WiLL Made It)
(Zaytoven)

[Verse 1]
I'm a walking lick, I look like a robber
You niggas ain't mobbin', you know you got a problem
You niggas ain't legit, see Gucci with the shit
You keep on talking slick then I'mma go and get the stick
Gutta as it get, still the talking brick
Used to have them ninety six impalas sitting on blades chopped
And that was ninety six, they treat me like a prince
When I was behind the fence you was acting like a bitch
So I might slap you like a pimp, my chef is cooking shrimp
The haters tryna' knock me off my throne but they can't do it it's like the thirtieth attempt
And you look like a wimp, and I don't even associate with niggas
Who associates don't have at least a M

[Hook]
Have at least a M
I don't even associate with niggas who associates don't have at least a M
Have at least a M
I don't even associate with niggas who associates don't have at least a M
Have at least a M
I don't even associate with niggas whose associates don't have at least a M
Have at least a M
I don't even associate with niggas whose associates don't have at least a M

[Verse 2]
I love the letter M, Gucci Mane a G
I'm from BC, Bouldercrest and I be skrapped up to the T
I used to have them P's, I got em' from AZ
And I used to pay like one for em' sell em' for the three
RIP to E
How you let a nigga in a motherfucking wheelchair beat you to the cheese
You deserve a D
Y'all ain't really flunk but you punks gettin' a lil' money but ain't get money like me
I'm steady pushing three
Or you can call it age, but ain't no need to call me unless you got ninety G's
I'm tryna' make a B
You tryna' make a play but get the fuck up out my face cause nigga you the F.E.D.'s

[Hook]
Have at least a M
I don't even associate with niggas who associates don't have at least a M
Have at least a M
I don't even associate with niggas who associates don't have at least a M
Have at least a M
I don't even associate with niggas whose associates don't have at least a M
Have at least a M
I don't even associate with niggas whose associates don't have at least a M

[Outro: Gucci Mane, Zaytoven & Mike WiLL Made It]
I mean like, would I need a nigga around me whose associates don't have at least a M
You ain't got to be rich to talk to Gucci, but you gotta' be part of something!
So you mean to tell me your daddy, your momma, your brother, your partner
Ain't nobody getting no money?
So everybody around you broke? (ha ha ha)
Nah! I ain't fucking with that man! (Oh hell no)
Nah for real, I'm with you Gucc'
I thought, you know I thought your uncle or something played for the Hawks
Ain't nobody play no pro ball or nothing? Ain't nobody got nothing?
Oh shit my phone's ringing, this gotta' be some money right here
( Hello! )
