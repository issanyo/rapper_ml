[Hook: Quavo]
Young niggas on the block they ain't give a shit
We had to get it
We can lose it all today
I know we still gon' get it
This the life that we choose and make I know we made a milli
But you can throw it all away I know we still gon' get it
They want the formula (formula)
The formula (the formula)
Everybody wanna get the formula
They want the formula (formula)
The formula (The formula)
They'll try to take your life to get the formula

[Verse 1: Quavo]
They'll try to take your life just for the formula
That why I keep my money and my strap like armour truck
You say young niggas ain't got no money you think that's harming us?
Make you believe in Santa Claus, Santa's sack is on us
I know that they hate that I came off a bag
I don't have to boast or brag just look at the cash
Nigga don't make me mad
That's why I had to put extensions in all of my mags
All of my life young nigga would get into something
Young nigga came up off of nothing
Now I got to learn the different lingo taking private jets across the country
You niggas still waiting on your momma
Somebody shine the lights upon them
You know that you need it, you want it
Migo the moment they say that we stole it
Really, I think that we earned it
And the picture we burnt it
All of my life I wanted this shit, put my name on the jersey

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Chef Boyardee I got the formula
Remember trapping midget when I was coming up
I'm on the block all night till the sunrise same time that you be getting up
Pulling up, hopping out dirty artillery hit you for your pack then we gon speed it up
Remember the bando days
We selling the formula it's a pot and a stove on the furniture
Young nigga trapping bags
On the block with Cam running from the fucking tag
Robbing the goon old man
Hop in the jag, young nigga hit the dash
One thing about the migo line nigga know we living fast
Whole lot of cash, OG cash bag in the Jag ain't gotta dash
Walk in the mall, nigga don't check the price tag just throw it in the bag
Ain't tryna [?] the ticket don't come at all if you ain't got the cash
Make a play get the cash right back so fast like flash
Fuck it up and take it rodeo yo' ass
It ain't swag we call it dab
Money bags whole slab!

[Verse 3: Offset]
Offset! Ok
We blowin' their mind
They think that we signed
You run up on me then your life on the line
If you do not grind then you will not shine
Lil' babies is crying I'm grippin' my 9
Formula, formula, formula
I got the ingredients turn you to a bachelor
Diamonds from Africa, smoking on [?]
Run with the sack then my niggas gon' tackle ya
Lil' bitches in the kitchen water whippin' makin' chickens bout to buy me a Bentley
Call up Flippa he gon' grab extensions hit the nigga make the nigga get some stitches
Bought the semi smoke him like a chimney
The sins I committed the lord gon' forgive me
The flow we invented you niggas is pitiful
[?] laugh at you fuck niggas due niggas
Can you keep a chicken for my leverage if you make me a whole milli
Cheap bags call it [?]
I got the eagles I'm not from Phili
[?] Is on you bentley no [?]
Giving out shots nigga no needle
Three amigos we the new Beatles
Smashin' your bitch got her in the fetal

[Hook: Quavo]
