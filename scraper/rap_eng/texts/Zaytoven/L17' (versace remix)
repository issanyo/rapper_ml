[Intro]
Class of 2017 I'm the man
Class of 2017 I'm the man
Class of 2017 I'm the man
Class of 2017 Lets get it!

Look

[Verse 1]
I'm not the artist to hop on these tracks and start rapping all braggadocios
But lately these rappers Attempting to Flow over tracks and it's So atrocious

But still I chose this old Versace beat
Hoping that they never copy me
Flowin fast cuz ain't no one stoppin me
Hide in the cut where the lions and tigers be

Now they question what's Real rap
All that mumbling stuff I don't Feel that
That's why I had to make This track
But trust me bro this ain't no Diss track

I was gone for awhile had to Get back
I ain't goin no where like a thumb tack
You went number 1 that's a mishap
So much happened this year had to Recap

I won't ever fake it
I promised my family and friends imma make it
And I'll never Regret it
Like I read it on redit I already said it

Don't you ever forget it
He said he need cash, but my money in credit

So I go to the bank and you know that I'm cashin it
And I'm Flowin real passionate
Shout out to class of 2017 I'm a graduate
Got the beat I ain't passin it
People try to tell me that I'm wack but they ain't accurate

Flow so hard I'm harassin it
Finesse this beat and look back like I'm actually talented
People say I'm a joke and I'm doing the most but I'm doing the same as Jim Fallon did

Cuz when I was so young people never believed in me never told me I was accurate
Now I swear I'm determined to grow up and blow up and show everyone else who doubted it

So I gotta go get it earn it by myself and just flaunt like ain't nobody helpin me make my way to the top and I ain't gonna stop until I win my family a Grammy let's get it
Let's get it

[Verse 2]
Oh, you thought I was finished
Your funny
Listened to one of your songs and you sound like a dumby
Not throwing shade but you bummy
Don't take it from me but you is a lame

Better stay in your lane
Cuz you is a fake
You a snitch and a snake
You sweet like a cake
Don't come for me that's a mistake

Many characters I can portray
SincerelyTrevor I'm lyrically better
Forever in sweaters and you cannot change me
I'm not a rapper but I can be

That's what society labels me
Like I'm a model for maybelline
Do what you're told and don't say a thing
You wanna cuff her but she wants a fling

She only wants you for a minute
If you tryna change it Forget it
It won't ever happen
Tryna make a livin off of rappin it's tragic

Watch me ball like the magic
Then flex on you like Kanye West with the fashion
Get a check then I cash it
I won't ever stop making music's my passion

Haters gon hate let them hate on me
Why you tryna put that weight on me
You left but I told you to wait on me
You were never there now people fake on me

Now look who grew up
Your gonna wonder how I blew up
So watch me get famous
I sound cocky but I'm anxious

I'm so optimistic
My future is bright so don't miss it
If you wrong with me better fix it
I swear I've always been ambitious

Please don't talk reckless and Vicious
Unless you wanna Swim with the fishes
Your whole career is deminished
Blew up and I'm not even finished

Aye

(Blew up and I ain't even finished)
