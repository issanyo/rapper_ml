[Hook]
My niggas ain’t scared Nah
My niggas’ll ride
Just hand em a gun
It's gon be a drive by

[Verse 1]
My niggas on go, my niggas I’m ready
Dressed up like Jason in Freddy
Krueger, we carry the Ruger
You know that my niggas gon shoot ya
Run in your house, taping up you and your spouse
Cover your eyes and mouth
My niggas they pointing the gun at your leg and head
And telling your kids get down
Brap, brap, brap
Where’s the money? Where’s the dope?
Before you get choked, put two in your throat
The street is a jungle, better tie your shoe cause I know you gon fall
Got a hundred round drum and you know it’s gon rumble
Migo Gang my squad, you better not fumble
Step on my block, you better stay humble
Call Woody and 17, know we call him [?]
Young rich nigga till I die
Benji’s in my pocket, stay with the rocket
QC, we on top, you know we ain’t gon flop
My diamonds got a nigga sick
Chop a nigga’s ass up, cinderblock
Your time running out, tick tock
It’s about to go down, Kevin Hart
Ride around Bentley coupe, money blowing out the roof
Green dot aiming at your head, for you [?]
Dig you 13 deep ditch, put you to bed
My niggas coldhearted, tell your mama that you dead
Your bitch she say she loving this life
Fish glam Audi, you know we keep the ‘Rari
Shooting the AK, running for your life
Raow! Ain’t saying it twice
The streets no game, so think twice
All of my goons come out at night
