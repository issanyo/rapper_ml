[Chorus : Shawnna]
Is you rollin? [x4]
Bitch I might be [x2]
Girl he geeked up
Girl he geeked up
Bitch I might be [x4]

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
East Atlanta slum man is where I come from
Pass that bubble thrax and put this bean on your tongue
Now everything was gravy 'til your bitch came in
Bout the same time that that thang kicked in
Now she ain't really pretty but she got a nice body
I'm geeked up thinkin' this Buffie The Body
Ain't your name 'lil Trina cause you look like Janet Jackson
I'm off three double stacks and I'm lookin' for that action
Gucci Mane you stupid man I love the way you flowin'
Ridin' in my drop but I don't know where I'm goin'
On two eighty five I keep ridin' in a circle
The inside of my ride smellin' like a pound of purple
Gucci is your time give me five more minutes
And a cold orange juice cause I'm really really trippin'
Went to the strip club and request that I'm da man
The next thing you know I was throwin' rubberbands

[Chorus : Shawnna]
Is you rollin? [x4]
Bitch I might be [x2]
Girl he geeked up
Girl he geeked up
Bitch I might be [x4]

[Verse 2: The Game]

Bitch I might be hiffie, I'm from California and this might be Nikes
Come and run up on 'em nigga
I'll wear your size, you wear my size
I got a big mac, let's make french fries
I'm high as a plane, pop a pill, disappear like David Blaine
Come back on the track with Gucci Mane
I got ten pillz, ten hoes, I'ma run a chu-chu train
All through Atlanta, my new nickname is coochie Game
I don't let 'em swallow, I show 'em how to use it man
Wa-dah-tah my damie, make them sell they pootie tang
You got some bad bitches I suggest you do the same
Treat my hoes like my cars, drop 'em in blow they brains
Wash 'em up then blow they brains
If she swallow the whole bat and the ball she can roll with Game
I been a soldier boy, niggas know the name
I'll superman that hoe and call her Lois Lane

[Chorus : Shawnna]
Is you rollin? [x4]
Bitch I might be [x2]
Girl he geeked up
Girl he geeked up
Bitch I might be [x4]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane the fly nigga get your mind right
Or a cries by the twelve like a case of budlight
Sell a cush by a bell so you kno might shit tight
See I'm 30 in the morning on a all night flight
I'm high like Fabo hood like Shawty
So tell me when to go like my name E-40
A rich rock star nigga I'm gonna party
Got a party pack of pillz that's at least bout 40
I'll pour dem in your hand like a bag of jelly beans
Take two of these pillz call me in the morning
Fifty thousand pillz man I'm so real
Three dollars for a pill that's a damn good deal

[Chorus : Shawnna]
Is you rollin? [x4]
Bitch I might be [x2]
Girl he geeked up
Girl he geeked up
Bitch I might be [x4]

[Outro: Guccin Mane & Shawnna
Ay wassup Gucci Mane

Shit well baby I might be
But got damn what is you doin'
You jockin' a playa. You ch-Chewy ova here right
Look I ain't

K-Rab baby You know what I mean I'm not a piece of Bubblegum
What I'm doin is not your business
But matta of fact while you ova here is you a waitress or somethin?
Cause the shit you got on make you look like you a waitress
So do what you do aight

Bring me and click about ten of dem orange juices
Five crunk juices nd we'll be straight how bout that
And is you straight is you single or is you marry
Cause I might be, Bitch I might be, Bitch I might be, Bitch I might be
