[Intro]
Zaytoven
Yeah
Yeah
Kingpin

[Chorus]
Up in Neiman Marcus coppin' all of the designer
Be in careful in the market, shoppin' for some cheaper product
I pull up, park it, hop out, I'm gon' need all of my guala
Young niggas in your city tryna jugg a million dollars
I just remixed me the whole thing
I hop out the whip with the whole thing
That drink in my cup, fill the whole thing
I empty the clip, yeah the whole thing
Up in Neiman Marcus coppin' all of the designer
Young niggas in the city tryna jugg a million dollars

[Verse 1]
Pull up in the Lamb, I got it from whippin' the work
Got it from whippin' the yams, I knock your dick in the dirt
I flipped some packs on the charter jet
I hit the town like the quarterback
I put three pounds in the backpack
I sold it all for ten thousand it though
I started straight from the bottom though
Roll with some niggas that's cutthroat
Duck out with them tools at your front door
I used to jugg from the corner store
I spent it all and I wanted more
I blew it all and I wanted more
I fucked the bitch and I forgot her name
I just address her as so and so

[Chorus]
Up in Neiman Marcus coppin' all of the designer
Be in careful in the market, shoppin' for some cheaper product
I pull up, park it, hop out, I'm gon' need all of my guala
Young niggas in your city tryna jugg a million dollars
I just remixed me the whole thing
I hop out the whip with the whole thing
That drink in my cup, fill the whole thing
I empty the clip, yeah the whole thing
I ran through the pack, yeah the whole thing
I ran up the check, yeah the whole thing
Pull up on your set with them whole things
I'm at your neck like a gold chain

[Verse 2]
I'm in the game, need a wedding ring
Know I promised but I couldn't stay the same
Bitches will change it up for the fame
I had to change it up for the change
I got a story that's filled with pain
I had to cut loose the middle man
I had to go get the product
I turn it to Fendi and Prada
All of my niggas is with me
Stackin' and grippin' on semis
I'm in the lab with the chemists
I teach you to remix the chicken
I see this shit is so vivid
All of my diamonds be vivid
Color cut clarity all in the stone
This shit was set up in stone

[Chorus]
Up in Neiman Marcus coppin' all of the designer
Be in careful in the market, shoppin' for some cheaper product
I pull up, park it, hop out, I'm gon' need all of my guala
Young niggas in your city tryna jugg a million dollars
