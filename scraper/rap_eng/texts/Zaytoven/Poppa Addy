[CKENT: Verse 1]

And they ain't neva seen a smart trap guy like me
I aced 6 fuckin finals, smoked an ounce in a week
My niggas said they wanna eat, I told em pull up a seat
The bossed up round table, whole squad gotta feast
Hit my nigga Zay-Tiggy , told him: Throw ya boy a beat!
And I know you hear them strings ... yea he hit me with that heat!
I might need a gucci feat. SFD - 1017
And I knew I'd be that nigga - back when I was 17!
When I turned 18 I had to move a couple packs
I was cruisin in the Max - had to upgrade to that Ac!
Navy blue , no tint , my nigga - I ain't neva hidin!
Prolly pass you doin 100 but look closer ya girl drivin
When we stop she get to ridin - this bitch is in here grindin
I'm on the fuckin come up man this shit is perfect timin
Rockin Nicky Diamonds tryna cop like Ricky's Diamonds
Ima young star. I know that you see me fuckin shinin

[CKENT: Verse 2]

Its Friday, I hit the trap for the 6th time this week
Refunds they just dropped so the students they fiend
Come shop I got gas molly white and that lean
Take it from Mr. Trappin For Tuition mix the addy with the tree
You'll be high as can be .... I'm talkin A's only
They said I couldn't afford Morehouse - I got a case on me
I got 10 plays on me ... my mom she pray for me
I said: "if its me or them I'm standin so sleep safily"
