[Intro]
I got amnesia, don't believe me
Make you wonder how I ever meet ya
Now I don't no a thing, but where my weed man?
Where the bitches? Where them ninas?

[Hook]
Amnesia, amnesia
I can't think of shit, I called amnesia
Amnesia, amnesia
Lost without words, what's your procedure?
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia
Baby you confused, I sure don't need ya
Amnesia, amnesia
Make you wonder how I ever meet ya

[Verse 1: SD]
I got amnesia, don't believe me
Make you wonder how I ever meet ya
Now I don't no a thing, but where my weed man?
Where the bitches? Where them ninas?
Now I don't talk too much, but that shit ain't it
Yes she addicted, yeah she fainted
I might just get her drunk, while she forgets it
Bro lets play victims, I got my strip [?]
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia, just is really kicking in
So tell me what is this?
And how did I get here?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: SD]
Amnesia, amnesia
I can't think right, who had a seizure?
I'm lost without words, no I don't mean it
I got my reasons, where my weed at?
I might get high enough to show my reasons
Who this policeman? What's her weakness?
No I ain't see a thing, I can't predict shit
Well lets talk business, we can fix this
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia, just is really kicking in
So tell me what is this?
And how did I get here?

[Hook]
