(Chorus)
One of me and two of y'all, that's menage a trois
They on them beans, look like Barbie dolls, giving Tylenol
Don't post them things, not on my feed, not on my wall
'Bout to give both y'all the D 'til I'm tired of y'all


(Verse 1)
They just wanna get with me cuz I'm shining, aww
They just wanna take a seat in the lap of luxury
They just wanna get next to cuz they want me
I'm tryna make you see everybody loves me
I can't wait to get both of y'all naked
Oh, my Lawd, I just can't take it
And if it's sweeter than a dozen of pastries
I'll eat it straight from the box, I'll taste it

(Chorus)
One of me and two of y'all, that's menage a trois
They on them beans, look like Barbie dolls, giving Tylenol
Don't post them things, not on my feed, not on my wall
'Bout to give both y'all the D 'til I'm tired of y'all

(Verse 2)
Now they wanna build with me cuz I got it, aww
Now they wanna take a seat on the lap of luxury
I was rocking Gucci before I had it all
................and the baddest broad
One of me and two of y'all, that's party time
'Bout to put in deep so long, have a heart attack
Both of y'all 'bout to be skeetin', like, a hunnit times
I'm 'bout to sine yo putty on the runny kine
I can't wait to get both of y'all naked
Oh, my Lawd, I just can't take it
And if it's sweeter than a dozen of pastries
I'll eat it straight from the box, I'll taste it

(Chorus)
One of me and two of y'all, that's menage a trois
They on them beans, look like Barbie dolls, giving Tylenol
Don't post them things, not on my feed, not on my wall
'Bout to give both y'all the D 'til I'm tired of y'all

(Outro)
I don't give a damn if they was twin sisters
I'm a sex pistol, call me Sid Vicious

"I'm just playing....SEXWAVE don't endorse incest."
