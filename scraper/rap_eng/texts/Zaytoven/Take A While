[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
I was trappin' loud out the vacant house
My nigga how you tryna take my style?
All my niggas wild, they'll take you out
Boy, you tryna be like Jefe? That's gon' take a while
I spark up that loud, I can't hear that sound
Count a hunnid thou, I'm like fuck a trial
Choppa on the couch, that bitch go bow bow
I ain't runnin' out, bitch gon' take a while

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
You like to run your mouth, you like a lil mouse
That new Nino Brown, I came to paint the town
Got a happy home, I take ya of my hoes
My bitch still get out I kiss her on her pouch
Choppa in the back, tell 'em (?)
He a runnin' back, ask him how that choppa sound
My hood look like Pakistan, we got alotta rounds
Damn I hope that Metro man, he got alotta pounds

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
I was trappin' loud out the vacant house
My nigga how you tryna take my style?
All my niggas wild, they'll take you out
Boy, you tryna be like Jefe? That's gon' take a while
I spark up that loud, I can't hear that sound
Count a hunnid thou, I'm like fuck a trial
Choppa on the couch, that bitch go bow bow
I ain't runnin' out, bitch gon' take a while

[Verse 2: Dex Osama]
All these niggas soft, all these niggas can go
Get to pickin' niggas off, eeny mini miny moe
Choppa boy, bitch choppa boy, we blou
AR with the monkey nuts, it's goin' down
Catch ya white pullin' up, leave our 223 in his truck
Me and my niggas don't give a fuck
(?) bitch we quick to bust
Fuck round with these dumb niggas
No drive by, we hopin' out slumpin' niggas
Shit, we do this shit for fuckin' fun
Put that money on his head, bitch we get it done
