[Intro]
Zaytoven
Hey, laughin' [?]
I'm on some project shit
Lil Mexico shit, nigga
I'm on some project shit

[Chorus]
Just a young hood nigga on some project shit (project shit)
With the whip, I'm 26 and that's some project shit (project shit)
Pulled up in the hood with a fly ass bitch (a fly ass bitch)
When I first got some money put some ice on my wrist (put some ice on my wrist)
Just a project nigga on some project shit (project shit)
With the whip, I'm 26 and that's some project shit (skrt)
Pulled up in the hood with a fly ass bitch (with a fly ass bitch)
When I first got some money went and iced out wrist (iced out my wrist)

[Verse]
I was raised in the hood, mama used to do dope (do dope)
Sundays [?] we ain't have no soap (have no soap)
Boy I had to hit that lick, I ain't have no dough (finesse)
Mario got jammed up with the keys of that coke (fuck)
Everybody caught charges, we just wanted that dough (wanted the dough)
Can't tell the cracker that they'll slam ya face to the floor (get out)
Real project nigga, used to trap with my uncle (trap with my uncle)
Same trap where he died we was doin' them numbers (doin' them numbers)
[?] got them old schools we gon' kill 'em this summer (kill 'em this summer)
Well a nigga buy a chain 'fore they buy 'em for him (we will)
Where you at, get finessed 'fore you ever do slip' (if you ever do slip)
Project nigga, ho then get this shit clear (ho then get this shit clear)

[Chorus]
Just a young hood nigga on some project shit (project shit)
With the whip, I'm 26 and that's some project shit (project shit)
Pulled up in the hood with a fly ass bitch (a fly ass bitch)
When I first got some money put some ice on my wrist (put some ice on my wrist)
Just a project nigga on some project shit (project shit)
With the whip, I'm 26 and that's some project shit (skrt)
Pulled up in the hood with a fly ass bitch (with a fly ass bitch)
When I first got some money went and iced out wrist (iced out my wrist)
