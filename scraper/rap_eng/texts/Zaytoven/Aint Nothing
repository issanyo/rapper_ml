Don't worry boy Ill take good car of her
Outer space but im in the universe
Im star, what was your guess first
She loves me like a dropped a curse

Started  Out Selling Porn in elementary
Don’t Gotta right a book im in history
Don't Gotta Read Books,She read books to me
Pussy used to be a riddle but I Found a Key

I don't need to change , I don’t even keep coins
Angel eyes princess , wash my fingers in her loins
I was born with wings, I was fly before im touring
One day I fell asleep, my Cash grew in the morning

Wipe the cold out my eye, bad bitch good morning
Okay ill take it, caz that broke shit got boring
Larent pierrer, Pouring
Sony XPR, Neymar Scoring

Little miss whay you want
Young Virgin, Young throat
First Class no more coach
But im already fly
Like wats up  im high
I don't even try
The songs is over goodbye



Ain't nothing you can say to make me feel away
Ain't nothing on this earth can make me feel this way
Ain't No day When I can't say what I wanna say
Dear money please make poverty GO away
