[Gucci Mane-Verse 1]
Everything new, hat to the socks
Feeling brand new like they pulled me out the box
Crazy color white and blues blinging off my watch
Its a Frank Mueller boo, and it cost a 100 rocks
Feeling brand new, cowabunga dude

Disrespect my crew, you might end up on the news
But that ain't nothing new so don't act like you confused (Gucci)

[Gucci Mane-Verse 2]
Say my head gettin big, and my chest poked out
Leave it smellin, burning rubber, parking lot smoke out
Nothing ever stays the same, out with old in with the new
This is true so you can go man and get another coupe
I need another ho, my old ho was the truth
I had to let her go, she kept naggin' bout my goons
I been saggin to the floor, told her pack her shit and move
Now I'm single once again, looking for me something new (Gucci)

Brand new everything, everything new

Im smoking on that fruit while I'm getting interviewed (Gucci)
