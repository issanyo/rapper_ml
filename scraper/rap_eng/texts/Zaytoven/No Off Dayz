[Verse: 1]
Put that shit to motion, this a Cosa Nostra
Hairweave killa, on a wanted poster
In the foreign car, back seat, leather sofa
I might need some help, we done bought up all the sodas
Hard to approach us, hard to stay focused, mobbin' on purpose
Car cost a crib it even came with the curtains
This I know for certain, this I know from workin'
Got it out the dirt and...

Trapping, 7 days a week, yeah I'm trapping
Trapping, straight up out a church and started trappin'
Trapping, Pulled out the Porsche just to trap in

[Verse 2]
Once upon a time, all I do is shine
We don't fuck around, we gon' gun ya down
We gon' smoke a pint, only rock designer
Hit the strip club, just to watch vagina
Breakin' down bags, seconds or zips
Smellin' like a bag, walkin' into Saks Fifth
Ferragamo, Fendi, rockin' buckets, nigga fuck it
Eatin' lobster tail, like they fuckin' chicken nuggets, yeah

[Hook]

Trapping, 7 days a week, yeah I'm trapping
Trapping, 7 days a week, yeah I'm trapping
Trapping, straight up out a church and started trappin'
Trapping, Pulled out the Porsche just to trap in
