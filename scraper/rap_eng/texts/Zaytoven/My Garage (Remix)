(Hook: Salty)
You should see some my garage
You should see some my garage
You should see some my garage
A lot of foreigns, a lot of cars

(Verse 1: Salty)
You don't need no key to start my car
Press a button then you take off
Aston Martin so fast
I love getting cash
Flashback I used to be broke
Now I live like I sell dope
Back against the ropes but I can function
Pipes driving ? hear me coming
House around my neck off hustling
Tint off like I got muscle
Buy what I want no more struggle
Try to rob me and imma bust ya

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Lil B)
Look what I'm flexing
Drop top Lexus
Fucking hoes mouth cause I flex new Bentley
Rolls Royce phantom 150 on a bad week
Riding on the freeway I'm driving and I'm texting
Talking to the bitches flexing so reckless
51 hoes, cause a nigga flex Bentley
Real Richmond nigga from the south to the north
Central, back street, niggas holding court
Mainline, same time, nigga I push the same line
Riding down McDonald's new paint line
Remember when Richmond had the whole stroll
Now we roll foreign cars and duck the popo

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Salty)
Never thought I'd buy what I bought
Did it wrong until I got caught
Got out, played the game smart
Ink my whole body call it art
Put my heart into my music, this shit real
Ride foreign cars with no deals
Spend five thousand on them wheels
Eat what I want when I feel
For the times I had no meals
Bentley go 200 those for real

(Hook)
