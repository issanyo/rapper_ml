[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus: Larry League]
Jewelry shine like knights in armor, we gon' charge (Charge)
I just reached into the bowl, that lick was large (Okay)
When it come to workin', we gon' charge (We gon' charge)
You got real low power, need to charge (Charge, charge)
Jewelry shine like knights in armor, we gon' charge (Charge, charge, charge)
I just played that pussy boy like a guitar (Okay)
When it come to workin', we gon' charge (Charge)
Gone in a minute, ain't no charge (No way)

[Verse 1: Randy!]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm a young star off them bars (Fuckin' geekin')
I'ma have to dodge 12 just like a Dart (Fuckin' squeakin')
I be runnin' up the check, bitch you still at the start (Fuckin' tweakin')
And I keep that iron, man, I'ma leave you Tony Stark (I'll leave you leakin')
I be pussy famished, I got that fam lit (It's fuckin' lit)
Bitch, I be either leanin' or off a Xanax
I ain't got no fuckin' rhyme or reason, I fuckin' planned it (I fuckin' planned it)
Pussy motherfucker cappin', ain't on this planet, ayy (Take you off the planet)

[Chorus: Larry League]
Jewelry shine like knights in armor, we gon' charge (Charge)
I just reached into the bowl, that lick was large (Okay)
When it come to workin', we gon' charge (We gon' charge)
You got real low power, need to charge (Charge, charge)
Jewelry shine like knights in armor, we gon' charge (Charge, charge, charge)
I just played that pussy boy like a guitar (Okay)
When it come to workin', we gon' charge (Charge)
Gone in a minute, ain't no charge (No way)

[Verse 2: Yung Bans]
Look, I'm on house arrest so I get charged, ayy
Bitches basic, can't think out the marg', ayy
I'm so high that I feel like a Martian
Geeked up, booted up, off them bars, bitch, ayy
Look at how my chain swang, 1OF1 the gang gang (Gang)
When I'm with my side bitch, treat her like my main thang
Know you niggas pussy, know you sweet like some candy canes
I just left the show with his he, 'bout to run a train

[Verse 3: Larry League]
Pants Dolce, but ain't shit sweet (Hell nah)
Larry get the okay and he pull up with the treats (The good drugs)
Go and throw cake, but please don't speak (Nah)
The only sound I'm tryna hear is when she on her knees (Suck it up)
And you know I got to charge, 'cause I can't do shit for free (Nah)
Runnin' up the check, collectin' every fee (Count it up)
Heard some dirt I did, but you ain't heard of me (Uh-huh)
We got horses, we gon' charge, bitch this ain't no burglary

[Chorus: Larry League]
Jewelry shine like knights in armor, we gon' charge (Charge)
I just reached into the bowl, that lick was large (Okay)
When it come to workin', we gon' charge (We gon' charge)
You got real low power, need to charge (Charge, charge)
Jewelry shine like knights in armor, we gon' charge (Charge, charge, charge)
I just played that pussy boy like a guitar (Okay)
When it come to workin', we gon' charge (Charge)
Gone in a minute, ain't no charge (No way)

[Verse 4: SenseiATL]
Turn that boy to nothin', he ain't nothin' but a waste (Pussy)
Heat seekin', bitch, I keep that heat up on my waist (Heat seekin')
Beatin' down doors, so I had to beat the case (Beat it down)
If it ain't blue faces then get the fuck up out my face (Hundreds)
I'm with Yung Bans, countin' young bands
Dirty in my styrofoam, feel like Dirty Dan (Sippin' mud)
You do what you can, I do what I want
Pull up if you want the smoke, bet you fuckin' won't (Pew, pew, pew)
