[Intro: Sean Bang]
You are now listening to Tha City nigga
South Florida shit nigga
Broward county nigga, palm trees nigga
Bitches with nice asses nigga, they be fake but they be nice
(Shit ain't all just fun nigga, it ain't all just clubs niggas)
All I am saying, when you come down here with your money don't be flossing and shit
Cuz niggas will take it
Niggas hungry
Niggas will kick in your door

[Hook]
Knock knock, don't make me bring it to your door boy
Knock knock, patrol tryna kick a nigga door
Knock knock, hair bows and golds made your bitch moan
Turn your main to a shone, now she finna' put on a show
I say smash, I know you heard me put it on your ho
I say smash need a fix, y'all all y'all boys broke
I say smash the Panamera, I'll buy a new one ho
Boom boom, nigga never ready to hear that sound though

[Verse 1: Robb Bank$]
Dope sold money fold, throw some water on the Karo
Nigga take a second look
Nigga hear remix then start writin' the hook
Fake jug, fake jug, you ain't sold merch out that jansport
Well I'm in my 95 explorin' and my backpack loud like Dora
Sir Mike in a six series circlin'
Gave you the cut like a surgeon, I'm servin'
Bitch I'm Shapiro, you Sir Ben
Boy we don't do no tens, give a fuck try to match up with your friends
You fake trap niggas reading books bout the babies like Lipschitz
Boys on that new shit, 30,000 Xanax
I stuck to what I knew, never touch the hard like a prude bitch
Ya'll certified pussy, ho nigga don't nobody go and buy bricks in New York, nigga
Better bring that ass down south, boy, Miami po nigga
Smokin' on a Port, nigga rollin'
My dick look swollen
I swear y'all wanna be sweet like Yoplait

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Robb Bank$]
Jays on my feet
Magnums on my meat
Check my roots but still tip toed I know these Kunta Kinte jealous
Fall in love but can't stand the way I had your bitch screamin
When y'all seen me whip it
Boy Panamera S, yes, Bitch its Double S Nigga
Hoes, ain't seen me in a minute call me Captain Ginyu
Way I body Switched into that nigga
But that's me in the flesh (Flesh)
Be careful Dooney out here Gookin' on 4 with a Xanax
I'm telling you these niggas finna lose it
These boys gettin' sick, Juice dont pass the blunt to 'em
They like "Bank$, you ain't real cause you ain't in Raider Klan"
They like "Bank$, you ain't real, people talkin' 'bout ya daddy"
Boy, Fuck y'all, I been walkin 'round Broward like I own the shit
Only nigga head to Toe in Gucci, riding a City Bus just for kicks
Give it to her Raw, like a sushi chef
Kawasaki Ichiraku ramen Naruto hentai dick
AT&T bill jumpin' while my Sade ringtone sangin'
Sellin' work like cell mates but thats over yo head
Boy the trap bunkin'

[Hook]
