[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
I'm dripping holy water, I got that holy water
I'm dripping holy water, I got that holy water
Do the Phillipe Patek (protect) me if it's dripping holy water
If she with me, respect it, she dripping holy water
Holy water, I got that holy water
I'm dripping holy water, I got that holy water
Do the Phillipe Patek (protect) me if it's dripping holy water
If she with me, respect it, she dripping holy water

[Verse 1]
Yah, sprinkle me with that water
I don't need a priest with a collar
Already been to the altar
Turn that dime to a dollar
They say he forgot that truth, now all he talk is money
I say truth is that my people in the hood and hungry
You don't really know my calling
You don't really want these problems
I stay fresh to death, but boy my whole team gotta be balling
Holy water steady dripping through
Look at how we brought the city through
116 and we been in the kitchen cooking up a chicken you can listen to
People wonder how we did it
People wonder how we get it
I tell em', don't chase the money, chase the vision, put your people into position
Turn that water into wine
Watch me grind, watch me shine
Grandma told me "God is good", I told Grandma "All the time"

[Chorus]
I'm dripping holy water, I got that holy water
I'm dripping holy water, I got that holy water
Do the Phillipe Patek (protect) me if it's dripping holy water
If she with me, respect it, she dripping holy water
Holy water, I got that holy water
I'm dripping holy water, I got that holy water
Do the Phillipe Patek (protect) me if it's dripping holy water
If she with me, respect it, she dripping holy water

[Verse 2]
Boy I swear I came from nothin' seen a lot of people fall
Took a lot of L’s called em lessons never took a loss
When they ask me how I say "Wow must not know my God"
Holy water drippin' One One Sixin' boy I’m with the mob yeah yeah
Holy water holy water dip me in drench me in it I'm drippin'
They told me the system would get me
I can’t lie the devil done tempt me
But now I’m covered and I’m clean
I’m still resisting all the schemes
You see me invest in my team
They killed the dreamer not the dream
All around the world
London to Dubai
Yes I fly, let them wonder why
I just trust the guide
Close my eyes
I could do this blind
I don’t walk by sight
Things just work out for me
I don’t do it well I do it right

[Chorus]
I'm dripping holy water, I got that holy water
I'm dripping holy water, I got that holy water
Do the Phillipe Patek (protect) me if it's dripping holy water
If she with me, respect it, she dripping holy water
Holy water, I got that holy water
I'm dripping holy water, I got that holy water
Do the Phillipe Patek (protect) me if it's dripping holy water
If she with me, respect it, she dripping holy water
