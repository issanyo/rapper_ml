[Chorus: ManMan Savage]
I went to see my PO the other day
My fist came back, right in his face
Bad motherfucker, got a 50 round drum
That 50 round got that bitch dirty
Got m on 30, count all them hundreds, that money dirty
That money, you know I did something dirty
If a nigga try to take somethin from me, you know Imma do him dirty

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Rich!
Nigga livin the street life, I don't deal with your bitch cause she dirty
I put a brick in the Berkin, all of my niggas still survin
PO still hatin on me, came home, had a rack just waitin
Young nigga still trappin while the block hot, smokin on gass from the top top
Imma do him dirty, catch you with a 30
Trap still jumpin like 23, still buy everything like Master P
Run round town with the third stick, had to put a Rolli on both wrists
Gave bout a hundred to my new bitch
Rich nigga eatin at Rooll Kris
Money so long, don't fold
I got my hoe off the coast
Flexin, I'm doin the most
Bitch ain't never seen a Ghost
In the trap, me and ManMan Savage
All of the money, I gotta have it
Don't try to cook, my drink dirty
Rari done break in your bitch nerves

[Chorus: ManMan Savage]
I went to see my PO the other day
My fist came back, right in his face
Bad motherfucker, got a 50 round drum
That 50 round got that bitch dirty
Got m on 30, count all them hundreds, that money dirty
That money, you know I did something dirty
If a nigga try to take somethin from me, you know Imma do him dirty

[Verse 2: ManMan Savage]
I just fucked your bitch, I came through, bag with the strap in it
Gotta watch my back, na, never slippin
You try to creep up on me, Imma do you dirty
Shoot you through the book, do you dirty
My partners just got hit with book, they got 30
That's why everyday I gotta keep the 30
What you want, a chicken, or you want a birdy
I send m to the kitchen, I told m whip it, hurry
Told her she goin whip it, whip it in a hurry
Fuckin on probation, still pissin dirty
Colors in my cup, that ain't nothin but dirty
Skippa in the cut, and he goin do you dirty
[Chorus: ManMan Savage]
I went to see my PO the other day
My fist came back, right in his face
Bad motherfucker, got a 50 round drum
That 50 round got that bitch dirty
Got m on 30, count all them hundreds, that money dirty
That money, you know I did something dirty
If a nigga try to take somethin from me, you know Imma do him dirty

[Verse 3: Skippa Da Flippa]
Flippa!
See, I'm a shooter, Flippa curve it
Or I hit you with the hook, shot just like J Worthy
She cookin the pot, she clean when it's dirty
Sippin on Ak, you think it was burbin
I make her whip it while I tell her stories, 50 come through with the tech, don't you worry
Tons of women, man, so you know we set
Ask you to count it, while you stack your Cabbage
Always around nigga, I ain't ever been avrage, I always roll round wearing Versace fabrick
Took school, but I couldn't get passed it
I could do you dirty, like that guy did Mavrick
Drinkin gass money, yes, I done had it
I took too much, I think I'm an addict
Always stay down, and I stick to the code
Dirty nigga, but I'm cleanin the rode
Chopper stay pointed to all of my foes
She see my hot box, and then she fold
1500 if you bring that bitch for sure
Every cop dirty, so fuck the law
Got my set right, so we move to right off
Dirty nigga if you fuckin raw
Flippa!

[Chorus: ManMan Savage]
I went to see my PO the other day
My fist came back, right in his face
Bad motherfucker, got a 50 round drum
That 50 round got that bitch dirty
Got m on 30, count all them hundreds, that money dirty
That money, you know I did something dirty
If a nigga try to take somethin from me, you know Imma do him dirty
