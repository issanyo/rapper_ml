[Verse 1]
As soon as you get home
I'll walk you to your section baby
Tell me what you're sipping on
Bottle service, I'm your waiter
Go head, request your favorite song
And close the blinds if you keep the lights on
High heels and your favorite thong
Watch me baby

[Hook]
I can be your stripper tonight
I'll pull out the pole baby if you act right
You can be my tipper that's tipping all night
Slow or do it fast, dancing like you asked
I can be your stripper tonight
I'll pull out the pole baby if you act right
You can be my tipper that's tipping all night
Slow or do it fast, slap it on my

[Verse 2]
We got our own private room
So you can touch it if you want to
Ain't gotta follow rules
Cause at home you're the owner
And I know who I'm working for
Cause you come in and make it rain
All your money on the floor
Boy I love it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
On top of dining room kitchen tables come get it how you want
Lap Dances on the sofa I got you standing up
I'm gonna let you do things you can't do in the club
And you're going to wake up, remember why you fell in love
So baby just watch me
Let me show you what I've been working on all week
And when I give it to ya
Call me diamond or you can call me peaches
Sink your teeth in all weekend

[Outro]
Ohhh I can
For you
Tipper, sipping all night
On Saturday
On Friday
I can be your stripper
For you I'm open 24 hours
Welcome home
