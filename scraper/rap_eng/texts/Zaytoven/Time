[Intro]
Ain’t nobody thriller than Metro
Aye I fuck with Metro
Aye, aw yeah

[Chorus]
Sit in the trap till my turn came
Distributing pack like the mailman
Whip up a deuce with my left hand
Pour up a three, that’s a kickstand
Yeah I came up from the middleman
Diamonds kicking like they Jackie Chan
Got a ball bustin out my pants
Send a ten back to my uber man
Sit in the trap till my turn came
Distributing pack like the mailman
Whip up a deuce with my left hand
Pour up a three, that’s a kickstand
Yeah I came up from the middleman
Diamonds kicking like they Jackie Chan
Got a ball bustin out my pants
Send a ten back to my uber man

[Verse 1]
Sorry on Monday, on Tuesday no problem
We got the bands they running up at em
Bitch I’m in the jungle, I am a lion
Main niggas turn me into Messiah
Bout time, put me straight out the fire
Phillip Plein, now that’s my attire
I am the man I can meet your desire
Talk to the poor like I preach to the choir
Told me I’m good I get back from consignment
How did I get here from trapping and grinding
More than getting busted but out I’m a diamond
Can’t wait man I’m finna shine
All this water on me I’m bout to drown
Throw me the man where is my crown
Really didi bills bloat down
I can serve you a thousand pounds

[Chorus]
Sit in the trap till my turn came
Distributing pack like the mailman
Whip up a deuce with my left hand
Pour up a three, that’s a kickstand
Yeah I came up from the middleman
Diamonds kicking like they Jackie Chan
Got a ball bustin out my pants
Send a ten back to my uber man
Sit in the trap till my turn came
Distributing pack like the mailman
Whip up a deuce with my left hand
Pour up a three, that’s a kickstand
Yeah I came up from the middleman
Diamonds kicking like they Jackie Chan
Got a ball bustin out my pants
Send a ten back to my uber man

[Verse 2]
Gold bell ring that the mailman
Pack that turd down from Oakland
Shout out to the plug, no middleman
Going two side I can sell nay
Say you gotta add it set him loose
Try to find the line outta Michigan
Since been dry since the letter hit
Gotta double down on the gag bih
None a this talk and the drug hit
Put my re-route like nudgy
What he talking bout, Detroit shit
Eighteen times two thirty six
Thousand day grind that’s a whole grit
Purple said ten make a nigga hit, shit
Pouring up ten in this flight remix
Skinny jeans on but my brain real fit
Everyday  I wake up I’m stupid lit
Walk around this bitch like a lick
Get your crew rot nigga caught at a bliss
Different real here make the head can’t spin
All the guys before me got me flexing steroids
Two fifty in the spot with the good talk
All my nigga m’d up superstars
In a real session that you can’t sell the toys

[Chorus]
Sit in the trap till my turn came
Distributing pack like the mailman
Whip up a deuce with my left hand
Pour up a three, that’s a kickstand
Yeah I came up from the middleman
Diamonds kicking like they Jackie Chan
Got a ball bustin out my pants
Send a ten back to my uber man
Sit in the trap till my turn came
Distributing pack like the mailman
Whip up a deuce with my left hand
Pour up a three, that’s a kickstand
Yeah I came up from the middleman
Diamonds kicking like they Jackie Chan
Got a ball bustin out my pants
Send a ten back to my uber man
