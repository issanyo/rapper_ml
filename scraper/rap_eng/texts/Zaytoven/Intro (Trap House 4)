Im pouring 4s in shit I need to just put a deuce in

Nigga its a gangsta party why the fuck is you in it
Head buster microwave shit they taking too many
You know that its some straps in the club they let my crew in
I might just do the Michael Vick dance and cook it left hand
If you ain't talking bout buying grams then I'm a deaf man
