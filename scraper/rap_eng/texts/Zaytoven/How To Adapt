[Hook: Lil Duke]
We the one they gotta answer to
My niggas be ballin like cancer do
They hating on us and they want us to fail
Gotta keep it solid don't ever tell
Started from the bottom I had to trap
Used to make caps and I switch up the wrap
Came from the trenches know how to adapt(2x)
Came from the trenches know how to adapt, Know how to adapt(5x)

[Verse 1: Yak Gotti]
Young nigga I had a heart like a lion
Can't trust ya own friend cause they dropping the dime
She say that she know me she probably lying
Spend a whole 40 just for the time
200,000 dollars just for the ride
Stayed down in my hood and I earned my own strips
She looking for me and she know Ima buy it
You think that she sweet when you see me then try it
When we in the air you know that it's private
Young nigga dream I want me a pilot
Drop a whole 36 in the pirates
Patch over my eye like I am a pirate
Ride with them young niggas know that they wilding
Balmain attire I don't need no stylist
Start with a rari then pull out the phantom
Try one of my niggas then you gone die

[Hook: Lil Duke]
We the one they gotta answer to
My niggas be ballin like cancer do
They hating on us and they want us to fail
Gotta keep it solid don't ever tell
Started from the bottom I had to trap
Used to make caps and I switch up the wrap
Came from the trenches know how to adapt (2x)
Came from the trenches know how to adapt, Know how to adapt(5x)

[Verse1:Jose Guapo]
Came from the trenches know how to adapt
We the ones put the 3 on the map
I know how to jugg and I know how to cap
We switched up the hustle we turn it to rap
I light up the kush put the dope in the air
We walk in the building they stop and they stare
I trap in designer's get two different pair
Spend a dub on my wrists and a dub on my ears
See you the type to get (?) of the year
See we the type to be dirty for real
See look at my cup it's dirty for real
See look at this clip its dirty for real
Product of my environment millionaire they surrounding me
Billion dollar establishment
Like lil Webbie we on savage shit

Came from the trenches know how to adapt, Know how to adapt(4x)

[Verse 3:Yak Gotti]
I come from the trap
These niggas they rap the life that I live
I ain't going back (Hell nawl Nigga)
I ain't going back from balling to raping to robing
From robing to raping to traping
Robing and raping and raping
Sending them packs in the morning
I'm to legit I never quit
I dare a nigga walk a like
I keep the choppa stick to scare a nigga
We the one they gotta answer to
Burgundy Banda roof all these nights out here thugging
I ain't got time to be playing with you
