[Hook: Trouble]
She can take a little dick but I can’t stand her
Some shit get old like my damn granny
I got the K, make a bitch panic
Get out the way if you can’t stand it
Sometime gotta roll, nigga can’t ram it
What you mean no, said I can’t have it?
Nigga answer that door with yo strap, damnit
Treat my lil hoe like a damn daddy

[Verse 1: Trouble]
I rock that gold like a damn grammy
Might eat her up like a damn sammy
I’m just gon’ hope that she won’t panic
I’m just gon’ hope that she won’t panic
When you get dough you get dope habits
Too many pulled up turned to dope addicts
You be so bad, ain’t got no plastic
I grab that ass, no asking
I get that cash, no capping
Crunch all these hundreds, no capping
All that I ask, no tapping
All that i ask of you no tappin
She suck that dick like she go to practice
I thought you said you was baptist
Really don’t want it, super nasty
I love that shit though, ain’t even nasty

[Hook: Trouble]
She can take a little dick but I can’t stand her
Some shit get old like my damn granny
I got the K, make a bitch panic
Get out the way if you can’t stand it
Sometime gotta roll, nigga can’t ram it
What you mean no, said I can’t have it?
Nigga answer that door with yo strap, damnit
Treat my lil hoe like a damn daddy

[Verse 2: Bankroll Fresh]
Young nigga started out trapping
Young nigga started out stacking
Young nigga made the shit happen
Young nigga took the hood platinum
I don’t trust none of these monkey bitches
All of that monkey shit, I ain’t with it
I came to get it, bitch what’s the business
Bitch I’m a trapper, I stay consistent
I’m kicking, pimping, little bitch listen
I dropped a dime, my ears glisten
I kept it real, them niggas switching
I got a pit I'll make em sick em
I got this shit here up out the mud
I got this shit, never had a plug
All the bad bitches they show me love
All the bullshit, I just look above it

[Hook: Trouble]
She can take a little dick but I can’t stand her
Some shit get old like my damn granny
I got the K, make a bitch panic
Get out the way if you can’t stand it
Sometime gotta roll, nigga can’t ram it
What you mean no, said I can’t have it?
Nigga answer that door with yo strap, damnit
Treat my lil hoe like a damn daddy
