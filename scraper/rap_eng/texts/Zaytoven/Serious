[Hook: Natasha Mosley]
Just cause you're clever
Don't disclose where I was
You slid in my head, told me I'm the one
Am I supposed to take you serious?
You want me to take you serious
It's gon' take more then some Jimmy, Fendi
Really, for real, boy for real
For me to take you serious
You want me to take you serious
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: Natasha Mosley]
I'm a bad bitch, I'm serious
You got that swag so I'm serious
I got that bank roll, I'm serious
It's getting physical, I'm serious
Oh yeah, for real, for real
For real, for real
I'm serious, uh-huh

[Verse 2: Kash Doll]
You want me to take you serious?
Gotta show me something
Ain't no used to fronting
This a million you's, tryna be the only one
And I'm just here stunting
Styling, Gucci slides on the island
Diamonds on my medallion
Shoes is Itallian, bag Coco Chanel
Bundles of 'ported foreign, and I ain't get 'em on sale
Aha, wrist got me flexing, when I talk on my cell
You don't wanna swipe me? Oh well
Know somebody who will
That's real, I don't love 'em, I don't trust 'em
If he ain't got hustle, don't fuck him
That's gang, he a sucker
DM's full of body's like the nudes I sent
Snapchat me the filter, for every mood I'm in
It shouldn't be news when I win
That ain't nothing new
They see how I did the coupe
Dip low, when I slide through
They see how I did the roof
Dip low when I ride to
So if I call him boo
Just know he the fucking truth
That's real!

[Bridge: Natasha Mosley]
I'm serious like a heart attack
Boy you know I got that water wet
I told him boy don't play
Diamond rings, private jets
Yeah, daddy I want all of that
For me to take you serious
Them diamonds ain't real
Them diamonds ain't real
You want me to take you serious
You and I
You want me to take you serious
But you ain't trying

[Hook: Natasha Mosley]
Just cause you're clever
Don't disclose where I was
You slid in my head, told me I'm the one
Am I supposed to take you serious?
You want me to take you serious
It's gon' take more then some Jimmy, Fendi
Really, for real, boy for real
For me to take you serious
You want me to take you serious
Uh-huh
