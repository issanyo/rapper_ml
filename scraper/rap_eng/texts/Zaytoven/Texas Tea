[Intro]
Sipping that Texas Tea, sipping that Texas Tea
Sipping that Texas Tea, sipping that Texas Tea
Bitch I’m leaning, bitch I’m leaning

[Hook]
I don’t give a fuck about a bitch
She don’t give a damn about me
Sipping that Texas Tea, sipping that Texas Tea
I don’t give a fuck about a bitch
She don’t give a fuck about me
I don’t give a fuck about a ho
We sipping that Texas Tea
Sipping that Texas Tea, sipping that Texas Tea
Sipping that Texas Tea, sipping that Texas Tea
Bitch I’m leaning, bitch I’m leaning
Bitch I’m leaning, bitch I’m leaning

[Verse 1]
I don’t give a fuck about a bitch
She don’t give a damn about me
Just sent 100 to my niggas
Finna put the whole city on lean
Jump out the Batmobile
Hopped in the spaceship
Number one on the charts
Bitch I’m in the air taking trips
Caught a play on that bitch
Pub deal got a nigga rich
Cashed out on that whip
No casino tips
Five bands for these kicks
You can take 100 pics
Sipping on the Texas Tea
What them hoes say about me?
Tell them hoes go and get your mind right
Why the fuck you want to hate? Get your grind right
If I pull up, nigga I’mma shine bright
H-Town on now, bitch I’m all right
Got my DJ with me, finna set it off
15 grand, nigga what the show costs
Thanking god every day for this blueprint
Caught a play on this nigga, left a shoeprint

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Sipping that purple potion
Got me on three wheel motion
Waves in my head like the ocean
If the pussy good know I keep stroking
I remember ESG
Swangabang on them niggas
Slim Thug had the boys in blue
Nawfside been on niggas
I ain’t had a job since high school
Used to be the lil nigga that was too cool
Used to love these hoes now a nigga so rude
Nigga ass down, send her home, uh uh
Black tee, polo, look house, no no
She a, go go, live her, for sure
I ain’t give a fuck about a ho
That bitch ain’t worried bout me
Just dumped a four on her ass
Sipping that Texas Tea
Yeah I’m riding in that genie
Aladdin on these bitches when you see me
Got a curve in my motherfucking TV
There’s 100 niggas out there wanna be me

[Hook]
