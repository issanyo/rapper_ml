(Chorus)
Hey, lady, how you doing?
[You] make me wonder how you do it
Cuz you're always smiling through it
Never know just how strong that you is
Hey, lady, how you doing?
You make me 'bout to lose it
Cuz your fragrance is bouncing through me
Never know just how long we'll do this, it'll be so fantastic

(Verse 1)
I'm about to make you believe
And think it's make-believe
Simultaneously
Is that alright, girl?
I wanna be the last thing you see before you sleep
And when you wake to me
We can escape the dream
And make it a reality to share this life, girl
You know you looking good
You know you smelling good
You know you cooking good
You got me feeling good

(Chorus)
Hey, lady, how you doing?
[You] make me wonder how you do it
Cuz you're always smiling through it
Never know just how strong that you is
Hey, lady, how you doing?
You make me 'bout to lose it
Cuz your fragrance is bouncing through me
Never know just how long we'll do this, it'll be so fantastic

(Verse 2)
I was catching waves, then I heard a siren's song
I was distracted by the rays, how long I been gone?
She said, "Come with me, I live under the sea
I really wanna take you there, won't you come there with me?
I'll be your mermaind
I'll serve you everyday."
I'm like okay
Let's make way
Look here, lady, time's a-wastin'
I'm an intergalactic Time and Spaceman
Jumping though portals, shooting pornos
It's about to get informal

(Chorus)
Hey, lady, how you doing?
[You] make me wonder how you do it
Cuz you're always smiling through it
Never know just how strong that you is
Hey, lady, how you doing?
You make me 'bout to lose it
Cuz your fragrance is bouncing through me
Never know just how long we'll do this, it'll be so fantastic
