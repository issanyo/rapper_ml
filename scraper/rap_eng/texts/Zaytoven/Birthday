[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
Do your dance it's your birthday
Move that ass it's your birthday
Spend this cash for your birthday
Blow that bag for your birthday
Spend a band if you worth it
You know I like it when you work it
Hit your dance on your birthday
It's what you want for your birthday

[Post-Chorus]
Go girl, go girl, go girl, go girl
It's your world, your world, your world, your world
You could have your way for your birthday
I eat the cake for your birthday
Beat it up for your birthday
Fuck it up for your birthday

[Verse 1]
Tonight you gon' party, tear down the city
You got a section
Your sister, your cousin, your bestie with it
You birthday flexing
Pop champagne, ain't no sips, straight from the bottle
Yeah, that's it
Night just started, gone and make a wish
Maybe later you'll get that birthday dick
Baby you so special (So special)
That birthday suit you wearing looks so sexual
She got a body like a bottle 'cause she bought it
Did it in Miami 'cause she knew she could afford it
Birthday sex test drive that model

[Chorus]
Do your dance it's your birthday
Move that ass it's your birthday
Spend this cash for your birthday
Blow that bag for your birthday
Spend a band if you worth it
You know I like it when you work it
Hit your dance on your birthday
It's what you want for your birthday

[Post Chorus]
Go girl, go girl, go girl, go girl
It's your world, your world, your world, your world
You could have your way for your birthday
I eat the cake for your birthday
Beat it up for your birthday
Fuck it up for your birthday

[Verse 2]
How many girls gone be poppin' rubber bands
Up in the place, tippin' them dancers, smackin' ass
What the hell you sippin' tonight
She say if it's brown, she ain't faithful tonight
She wanna wild out, she wild out, she wanna play
Wanna get fucked up, she wanna live for today
She wanna wild out, she wanna kiss on her friend
And that's the kind of mood she in

[Chorus]
Do your dance it's your birthday
Move that ass it's your birthday
Spend this cash for your birthday
Blow that bag for your birthday
Spend a band if you worth it
You know I like it when you work it
Hit your dance on your birthday
It's what you want for your birthday

[Post Chorus]
Go girl, go girl, go girl, go girl
It's your world, your world, your world, your world
You could have your way for your birthday
I eat the cake for your birthday
Beat it up for your birthday
Fuck it up for your birthday

Go girl, go girl, go girl, go girl
