[Verse 1: Shawty Lo]
They say I'm dead, show me the gravestone
Westside Bankhead, I’m from Bowen Homes
And we boardin up, we can get it nigga
Hundred round banana for a monkey nigga
Social network got the game fucked up
Fake ass rappers tryin' to live like us
Dope boy loving all that fake ass jewelry
Y'all some twitter gangsters, facebook bullies
MDC, they my young niggas
Nigga tried to hate, but we back nigga
And everything cossa, (cossa)
Cossa Nostra

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Nigga holding us on me, but it's ok
I make a hundred bands a week
Yeah it's all fame
Right at the other week, and the money made
Night time pull out that piece, nigga I don't play
Drop head, pull up on em make em drop they head
Caught yo bitch at the Ritz, made her drop her head
“Get that Ric Flair, better yet Dusty Rhodes, started at a dusty row
They tried to talk that talk bout me, but it's ok
Bitch we the hottest in the streets, that what the streets say
The bitch mad say we're cheap, fuck what she say
The nigga mad cause I’m eating, but it’s ok

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
He say, she say, we said
Gucci Mane a weed head
So many bitches in my room I think I need like 3 beds
He eat it, I beat it, found out she cheated, he heated
He text me, wanna question me 'bout a bitch I deleted
If she a keeper then keepy her, you took her all round your people
I feed her mollies and reefer
You look you love her and cuddle, I beat her, fuck her, then leave her
I be the fucker and leave 'em, you tellin' her that you love her
You tellin a bitch you love her, you met that bitch meet your mother
Don't play yourself like a sucker
Remember my homie Butta, brothers from different mothers
He said she said that you said that y'all was like a couple
She got a nigga in Augusta, and other nigga in Tucker
Can’t hustle the hustle her cause I’m busting her while you cuffing her
