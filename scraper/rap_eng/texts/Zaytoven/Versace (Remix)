{Migos - Versace (Stefan Remix 2014)}

{Freeverse}

Listen up y'all
I'm a rookie and that's you you call an atrocity
When your ready just come with me I travel at a euphoric velocity
Maybe you'll like what you see and I guarantee that you will just take a seat
Honestly all that I'm here for right now is just to say the way that it's gotta be
Ain't no way that I won't get my Versace Versace Versace Versace
And my Louie and prada and Gucci and yeah that's much more than a probably 
Hey shorty I see you we havin a party get the fuck on my propertie
Beautiful Carly Rae Jepsen I gone call her maybe and no one can stop me
Couple a British Colombians reppin this beautiful province we livin' in 
Hope Carly is listenin when she in mission ill take her to dinner then
We'll make a new single together the hotter the better I'm feelin it 
Too real to conceal this skill cut a new deal cause I got her believing it
You think that I've toned it down slowed it down tell me when you've had enough
Can't wait to throw it down for ya
Heard that these punks they've been callin my bluff
Better be ready my newest my freshest most potent and dankiest stuff
Yeah, im bout to put it down for you now, uh I'm bout to rip it up
Getting an Sti soon as I make another flip, but my dicks clean baby I just got a sick whip
Hop on in beside me hunny just for you I got a tip
Feel that bass in the trunk "ya" vibrate your clit
Hey Carly dunno what else ima say
You a sexy young lady such a pretty little face
Rapid on the flow baby tell me what's your favourite pace
Even when I go slow ill still make you win the race
But I really wanna give it to you every single way
She said slow it down baby ain't much more that I can take 
But I'm finna' go fast cause I love the way it tastes
Like her pussy in my mouth I could eat that shit for days
I bet that I could make you give it all away
I'ma grind with you till I see that look up on your face
Got her wetter than the west coast even when it rains
I could play all day lady uh I love these kinda games
Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace
It won't be much longer if you don't believe then bitch you just watch me
New king of this genre, no need to relieve me, put me in that hot seat
She asked if we can do a little somethin later, turn around girl, yeah probably
K I'm sorry don't mean to be shallow
But I cannot help it like I cannot rap slow
It isn't my fault I kinda feel bad tho
Totally joking dont give a fuck, you silly ratchet ho
No I won't buy you Versace I won't buy you drinks, or Maserati's
What the fuck do I look like to you right now? great value's not in my budget get off of me
Versace Versace but at work it's all komatsu or hitachi
Until I'm full time in the booth ya this kids a valuable commodity
But still ill be reppin my cartharts my sweatpants addidas and nikes
Ain't nobody ever believe how I do it with the flow 
Ain't no fuckin controlin' it for the life of me
I come from van island but I'm movin up
Need more ground to cover this isn't enough
I'm crossing the ocean I'm bringin the bud and yeah following me is the party my love
Got enough to smoke for every single one of us
Roll it up with a little bit of dmt dust
And the best M so she'll be drippin with lust
Yeah we trippin but here you can place all your trust 
We from bc buddy so you know what we smokin on
Lets get it goin follow me now we gone have a toke along
Every mornin that I wake up I just cannot wait to fly
Everybody light up another doobie with me and get high
