[Verse 1]
It is what it is, my nigga, keep it real
Biting a nigga's style, trying to steal my adlibs
Young Juiceman gon' tell that how it is
You ain't my damn dog, let's just keep that shit real
Any of your niggas gon' tripping on the pills
But I ain't tripping, dog, 'cause I'm focused on a mill
Young Juiceman and I sell pill
Dancing ass nigga, keep dancing up that hill
It's all fucking gravy, nigga tried to play me
But you know Juice, man, I'm living life, baby
Water whip the work and I'm still serving babies
Smoking on the kushy and I work daily

[Verse 2]
I'm still in the streets, so a nigga can't tell me shit

Been hustling for a long time, rapping it for a minute
That's why I got them stupid bands 'cause Juice in it to win it
Bouldercrest shawty, yeah, the fans love me
Pull up to the club and I'm sitting on Budniks
Stupid crazy swag, dog, and your girl love me
Kill them with the swag with "I'm Getting Money"
"Hummer and a Jacob" for folks who have money
Pontiac Grand Prix, trapping with my homies
Keep that shit a hundred, Juice ain't never phony
Rubberband nigga get peeled like bologna

Right hand shawty, Pyrex, please
