[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
Oh, silent night (It was a silent night)
Holy (Holy night)
All was calm, and all was bright
A silent night, it was a silent night
It was a silent night, it was a silent night
What a silent night

[Verse 1]
The prophecy was that he would be born in the manger
Star was born that night and he would be the savior
Born of a virgin, he was just a humble servant
He could've came down in the clouds with a host of angels singinâ€™ loud

[Chorus]
But it was a silent night
Holy (Holy night)
All was calm, and all was bright
A silent night, it was a silent night
It was a silent night, it was a silent night

[Verse 2]
King Herod was full of jealousy
And three wiseman came quietly
And they laid their gifts at Jesus' feet
To honor the king of kings
But they traveled so far, all they had was a star
Their compass was their soul
Yeah, it was in their heart
And there was no room, that was okay
Jesus was born and history was made

[Chorus]
It was a silent night
Holy night
All was calm, and all was bright
A silent night, it was a silent night
It was a silent night, it was a silent night
