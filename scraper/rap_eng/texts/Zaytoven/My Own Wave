[Chorus: Blacc Zacc]
I ain't gotta ride your shit, I got my own wave
I better not catch you in my trap, go get your own plays
I used to sleep with J's, I still sleep with K's
I can't leave the streets, that's what got me paid

[Verse 1: Blacc Zacc]
I saw my brother cut that dope up with a switchblade
My daddy left me, who the fuck gon' get the rent paid?
I used to want some J's, used to want a bitch that slayed
But now I make her pay, fuckin' bitches state to state
Ayy I ain't gotta ride your wave, I ain't no rapper ho
But got an AP on my wrist just like these rappers though
Skydweller Rolex, flex on them like Boflex
Blue hundreds, let's make a mess
Call that shit a dirty check, ayy
Whole team gettin' money, bitch we bust down
Ayy I know she came with you but she with us now
Smokin' out the pound, no this ain't no Bobby Brown
My plug load me down, then I go supply the town

[Chorus: Blacc Zacc]
I ain't gotta ride your shit, I got my own wave
I better not catch you in my trap, go get your own plays
I used to sleep with J's, I still sleep with K's
I can't leave the streets, that's what got me paid
Numbers (I ain't gotta ride your shit)
Numbers (I got my own wave)
Numbers (I better not catch you in my trap)
Numbers (go get your own plays)
Numbers (I used to sleep with J's)
Numbers (I still sleep with K's)
Numbers (I can't leave the streets)
Numbers (that's what got me paid)

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
Look, dope fiend auntie goin' through the motions
Used to sleep on the floor with the roaches
Ashy niggas, we ain't have lotion
I call the plays and I don't know the coaches
Jealousy a female trait
Too much dope make the scale break
I position my cellmate
He been stressed out 'cause his mail late
Sellin' dope from behind bars
But fuck the trap, had nine cars
Young nigga really had it hard
I remember stealin' all them VCR's
Back to back in them Hellcats
These double-G's, no Airmax
Keep your hammer on Fairfax
Niggas locked up, send a care pack
Sold real keys and real P's
Trap star, he little league
Bust down, these real D's
No SI's, these VV's
Bad bitch, give her good dick
Side ho and a hood bitch
Blacc Zacc insane crip
Young Philthy Rich and Seminary bitch, it's Philthy

[Chorus: Blacc Zacc]
I ain't gotta ride your shit, I got my own wave
I better not catch you in my trap, go get your own plays
I used to sleep with J's, I still sleep with K's
I can't leave the streets, that's what got me paid
Numbers (I ain't gotta ride your shit)
Numbers (I got my own wave)
Numbers (I better not catch you in my trap)
Numbers (go get your own plays)
Numbers (I used to sleep with J's)
Numbers (I still sleep with K's)
Numbers (I can't leave the streets)
Numbers (that's what got me paid)
