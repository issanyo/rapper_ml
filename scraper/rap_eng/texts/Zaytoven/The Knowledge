[Chorus: VL Deck]
It's up, tell me what's the knowledge
I only send hits 'cause I only want bodies
Fuck your white flag, nigga we don't do apologies
Frank White Deck, I got hitter that's gon' slide for me
Runnin' through the bag so the plug graduated me
Racks got me cocky, my lil niggas think I'm straight from it
Cutter with the scopes, knock an opp to his fuckin' knees
Pippen in the magazine, F&N hold thirty-three

[Verse 1: VL Deck]
My city I'm the C, go hard for the paper
Live the life of monster, kicking doors for petty capers
Last time to live, somethin' like the rich folks
Tired of all this poverty, it's robbery, it's no joke
My life like a movie, talkin' straight daily
Bitch my lawyer Jewish, got a stick and I'm ready
My lil partner on the food, give him a fixing daily
I seen him in action, he hit a corner and get messy
So fuck your white flag pussy, we don't want peace
I ain't satisfied nigga 'til that ass six deep
And your partner them next, I bet that ass won't rest
So tell your mama and your sister them get out the black dress

[Chorus: VL Deck]
It's up, tell me what's the knowledge
I only send hits 'cause I only want bodies
Fuck your white flag, nigga we don't do apologies
Frank White Deck, I got hitter that's gon' slide for me
Runnin' through the bag so the plug graduated me
Racks got me cocky, my lil niggas think I'm straight from it
Cutter with the scopes, knock an opp to his fuckin' knees
Pippen in the magazine, F&N hold thirty-three

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Heard these niggas want beef
I'm in the North, niggas know I'm in the streets
He said it's up, when we catch him we gon' see
Real shooter, he stay silent, never speak
Ain't taking shit back that I fuckin' said
These niggas know how we play it
I won't hesitate to spray it
Catch you, we gon' bust your head
Forty Glock, bitch I'ma spray that
Squashing shit, no we don't play that
You want smoke then nigga say that
We gon' send shots where you stay at
Shoot your taco, you ain't with that
We gon' pull up where you lay at
Nigga know that gang be that
Plus your trap like I ain't see that
Same place that we gon' creep at
Drown, make a nigga get back
Up this bitch, bet I don't miss that
Swear that I'ma push your shit back

[Chorus: VL Deck]
It's up, tell me what's the knowledge
I only send hits 'cause I only want bodies
Fuck your white flag, nigga we don't do apologies
Frank White Deck, I got hitter that's gon' slide for me
Runnin' through the bag so the plug graduated me
Racks got me cocky, my lil niggas think I'm straight from it
Cutter with the scopes, knock an opp to his fuckin' knees
Pippen in the magazine, F&N hold thirty-three
