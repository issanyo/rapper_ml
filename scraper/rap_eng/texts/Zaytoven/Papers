[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, papers
Oh, oh, oh, papers

[Verse 1]
I can't get to work on time
Can't believe the words to her I just said
But who the hell argue and fight like dogs at 6 in the morning?
I know it's gonna be some more shh... tonight, oohh
Our pastor's calling, telling me I done went too far
And I'm seen around town and my friends can't recognize me
'Cause I took a chance on love
It's like I'm dying (oooh dying)

[Chorus]
For you, I gave my heart and turned my back against the world
'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl
I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama
I done turned into the man that I never thought I'd be
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl
I can't deny how much I love you, I done gave up everything I had to
As hard as it is, I'm afraid I gotta say
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl

Oh, oh, oh, papers
Oh, oh, oh, papers

[Verse 2]
I'm losing my mind, can't figure out who's wrong or right
I know it's you I love, but then, I also know it's you I don't like
You claim you hate who I was, but that's the reason you here now
You think I don't know what's up, but sweetheart, that's what ruined us
I ain't afraid to say I got needs, but the only time you here for me
Is when the bottles popping and everything is sweet
But I, I'm tired of sleeping in the other room spending them long nights
Trying to figure out what in the hell in my heart I ain't do right

[Chorus]
For you, I gave my heart and turned my back against the world
'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl
I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama
I done turned into the man that I never thought I'd be
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl
I can't deny how much I love you, I done gave up everything I had to
As hard as it is, I'm afraid I gotta say
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl

Oh, oh, papers
Oh, oh, oh, papers

[Bridge]
(Ready, ready, ready, ready)
All my fellas up in here
If you had enough and you're ready to sign, say
(Ready, ready, ready, ready)
I'm ready, yes I am
All my ladies, if you sick and tired
And you're ready to sign, say
(Ready, ready, ready, ready)
I can't keep living this life, I said, I'm leaving for the last time I'm
(Ready, ready, ready, ready)

[Chorus]
I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama
I done turned into the man that I never thought I'd be
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl
I can't deny how much I love you, I done gave up everything I had to
As hard as it is, I'm afraid I gotta say
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl
