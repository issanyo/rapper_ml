[Hook: Young Nudy]
I'm a Savage, he a Savage
I'm a blood, he a blood
Stacking my money, nigga run it up
Now I can sit back and drink mud
Sipping on lean, same colored blood
PDE Slaughter Gang, no it's us
I'm a Savage, he a Savage
I'm a blood, he a blood
Stacking my money, nigga run it up
Now I can sit back and drink mud
Sipping on lean, same colored blood
PDE Slaughter Gang, no it's us

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Blood, I'm a blood
Young Savage bitch, I drink mud
2-2-3 hit your ass with a slug
Blah, nigga you a thug
Nigga I ain't ride thugs
20-16 on it, and they scrub
Capping that nigga, call your hoe
You laid out with your bitch, you light the hood
I know that on her face I like to fuck
I ran it off and ran off on the plug
I counted up a hunnid in the trap
You talk that shit I put a .100 in your back
Blah, blah hit that nigga with a mat on the front street
Young Savage bitch, I sold that dough on the 1st street
Young Savage bitch, I get that chopper on the front seat
I'm a big dawg, little nigga you a pip squeak

[Hook: Young Nudy]
I'm a Savage, he a Savage
I'm a blood, he a blood
Stacking my money, nigga run it up
Now I can sit back and drink mud
Sipping on lean, same colored blood
PDE Slaughter Gang, no it's us
I'm a Savage, he a Savage
I'm a blood, he a blood
Stacking my money, nigga run it up
Now I can sit back and drink mud
Sipping on lean, same colored blood
PDE Slaughter Gang, no it's us

[Verse 2: Young Nudy]
Count money, know it's bloody
Everybody screaming 'Bloody'
.730 goin' 730 on your buddies
They got choppers, we got choppers
You got a problem, they got a problem
Everyone whippin' out choppers, problem solving
Stay on your lane, nigga not part of my gang
PDE Murder Gang, Slaughter Gang, Murder Gang
Everybody been the same
I stayed trippin' off a brick
Put it out, let it rip
Hit your bitch then I dip
Left a lil somethin' on her lip
Back in the trap, my man is there
Run out of bands with them
Cause all of my young niggas Savages
And all of my young niggas having it
I'm from the six where we clappin' shit
These niggas really think we rappin' shit
I'm from the hood where we none but Savages
And everybody gon' rap some shit, nigga

[Hook: Young Nudy]
I'm a Savage, he a Savage
I'm a blood, he a blood
Stacking my money, nigga run it up
Now I can sit back and drink mud
Sipping on lean, same colored blood
PDE Slaughter Gang, no it's us
I'm a Savage, he a Savage
I'm a blood, he a blood
Stacking my money, nigga run it up
Now I can sit back and drink mud
Sipping on lean, same colored blood
PDE Slaughter Gang, no it's us
