In the trap ain't got no lean, Fuck it nigga lets rob for free
Posted on the block ain't got no weed, Fuck it nigga lets rob for free
Nigga off the shits dont know my name, Fuck it nigga lets shoot for free
Nigga snatchin cheese dont know no names, Fuck it nigga lets eat for free

[Verse 1: Tray Savage]
I don't wanna work just for the cheese, I need that shit just for the free
Steady whippin Yola call it these, Earth smokin damn ain't got no lean
Police come I do the damn thing, Bitches on my trap dont know no names
Foreign Ride I keep a couple things, Blow a nigga brains my any means
Catch em serving bags running for the cheese, ain't no serving pussy nigga thats for free
Catch em serving bags running for the cheese, ain't no serving nigga that shit for free

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Robbin with no mask on, You ain't heard my last song?
Bitch I rob my plug cuz he hit my fucking cash wrong
Rob my plug for five pounds and got this shit for free
Finna roll a whole zone ain't nobody smoking but me!
Up trapping late night while you pussy niggas sleep
With Tray Savage in the trap we just whippin up some keys
And my bitch come from Russia She just flew from overseas
Ballin so damn hard like im in the major league
And yo bitch all on me but she not in my league
I just fuck her and kick her out cuz you know that pussy for free
Put work on your block, Come and get that shit from me
For free [2x]
