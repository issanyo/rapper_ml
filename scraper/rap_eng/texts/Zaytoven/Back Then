[Intro]
Yeah, it's 1K forever, you know what I'm saying?
Zaytoven

[Verse 1]
Just the other day I was reminiscing 'bout the bad times and the good times that we had
A lot of situations went left, aw man, I ain't never going out sad
Not me, no way, no house
Slept back then, but not right now
Living up north, I can't go south
But I'm always in the south

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I was born and raised on that East side of Atlanta (born and raised, man)
Used to ride around town with Dirty Diana (Michael Jackson, man)
Still kick the flavor, you can even tell from my grammar (I'm speaking slang)
Had to change my life 'cause I was on my way to that slammer, yeah man

[Chorus]
We came a long way from back then (long way)
Came a long way from back then (long way)
Came a long way from back then
We came a long way from back then (long way)
I remember way back when
Yeah, I remember way back when (I do)
Came a long way from back then
Phew
(Came a long way from back then)

[Verse 2]
Let me take you back to when we were doing them dirty things in that side street, and they'd call at 12
Young and wild we was all 12
Skipping class and we all failed
I ain't tryna say that was cool, just thinking 'bout how we was
Cracking up with Dre, that boy a fool, man, rest in peace to my cuz
I got time to count on these folk
I'ma stay real and that's on my fam
I'ma stay true 'cause that's who I am
Came a long way from busting them scams
Working hard with my co-workers
1K is my faculty
Waving at my haters as I'm looking down from my balcony
Let's do it

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I was born and raised on that East side of Atlanta (born and raised, man)
Used to ride around town with Dirty Diana (Michael Jackson, man)
Still kick the flavor, you can even tell from my grammar (I'm speaking slang)
Had to change my life 'cause I was on my way to that slammer, yeah man

[Chorus]
We came a long way from back then (long way)
Came a long way from back then (long way)
Came a long way from back then
We came a long way from back then (long way)
I remember way back when
Yeah, I remember way back when (I do)
Came a long way from back then
(Came a long way from back then)

[Verse 3]
It's a lot of folks that wish they never would've doubted
They ain't really think we was grinding
Now I bet they really know we 'bout it
Yeah, I believe in perfect timing
Everyday I'm throwing up who I'm with feeling like they giving me the heimlich
'Cause I gotta stick to my assignment
So lit, we be changing all the climates
We done got the church goin' wild already
I ain't even know it was coming this fast
Boyâ€™s lookin' at me like, "He ain't gon' last"
Now we got the whole wide world on smash
We the new church, everybody gon' know it and that's no lie
It's going up when I'm in yo' state and I know why (How come?)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I was born and raised on that East side of Atlanta (born and raised, man)
Used to ride around town with Dirty Diana (Michael Jackson, man)
Still kick the flavor, you can even tell from my grammar (I'm speaking slang)
Had to change my life 'cause I was on my way to that slammer, yeah man

[Chorus]
We came a long way from back then (long way)
Came a long way from back then (long way)
Came a long way from back then
We came a long way from back then (long way)
I remember way back when
Yeah, I remember way back when (I do)
Came a long way from back then
