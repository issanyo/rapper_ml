[Verse 1-V-Nasty]
I think they mad 'cause I'm relevant
Big choppers put holes in elephants
I got a bad bitch and she's elegant
Bet a hundred thousand that bitch selling it
I'm on the block, and bitch, I'm doing hella shit
Them suckers over there looking is irrelevant
I got a boatload coming from Mexico
And if the bitches talking gas, they ass like Texaco
I'm a reckless ho, you can't check this ho
Bitch, my outfit cost more than your necklace, ho
And I'm doing shit that you never seen before
Having withdrawals, man, hurry bring my bowl

[Hook-V-Nasty]
Fuck you

You can't fuck with us

[Verse 2-Gucci Mane]
I got a swag so sick, make the broad cough
I got a Lamborghini, hit the gas, the bitch get lost
You with a loser, need to lose him, if not, your loss
I got her syrup, bourbon, timber she stay in their cross
I'm a boss, you's a worker, boy, go jerk off
Brick Squad on the stage, know our shirts off
And I'm horny as a rhino and her ass soft
I got a fetish for a fine ho, I break her off
Let's get it on, let's get it in
Let's get it on, do it again
So bring a friend if you want to
Don't tell me what you won't do
Want me like I want you?
All night long, let's get it on

[Hook-V-Nasty]
Fuck you

[Verse 3-Slim Dunkin]
I fuck her, you lick her, I hit her and pass her
The number at the light, Imma fuck her by tonight
She says her friend a dyke so she allergic to the pipe
Under roun' roun' no insurance, fuck the no queen no endurance
Take care of my appearance, seen True's on clearance
Fuck your mama, your sister and your kids
Would say fuck your girl but I already did
I be in and out of jobs, can go in and out raw
And I got the bird, man, I be stuntin' like my boss
Going private when I travel plane, Louis in my baggage claim
Standing on the couches with V-Nasty and Gucci Mane
All the ice on my hands got my fingers cold
Call me Slim Dunk, I don't finger roll

[Hook-V-Nasty]
Fuck you

You can't fuck with us
You can't do what we do
