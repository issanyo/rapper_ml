[Hook: ]
I might just pull up with my motherfucking shooter
Put 60K on my bitch just to make her cooler
You know her attitude be hot I got to cool her
These pants so low my wrist is icy like a cooler
I might just pull up with my motherfucking shooter
I might just pull up with my motherfucking shooter
Put 60K on my bitch just to make her cooler
You know her attitude be hot I got to cool her
These pants so low my wrist is icy like a cooler
Your bitch just want to fuck me and my fucking jewler

[Verse 1: ]
These rubies in my chain could hypnotize Medusa
Don't make me have to call a Pablo he gon' shoot you
My ese run up with them sticks he might just do you
And for a brick my nigga pull up he gon' shoot you
Cause we don't play no games around here we some shooters
Bitch I'm a pull up with my motherfucking shooters
Your bitch on my ride so you know I might just screw her
I took that bitch to Benihanas then I screwed her
I placed the ride inside the bands off of that scooter
You got all them semi's but ain't got no shooters
You got all them packs but you ain't got no movers
Bitch I'm inside the trap you know how I maneuver
Pull up with SK's and my ese's we some troopers
Bitch all my niggas bout that life and we some shooters
I put a hit on you tomorrow then go do you
Bitch I pull up at 12 o clock with all my shooters
I need my money in my hand or I'm a do you

[Hook: ]
I might just pull up with my motherfucking shooter
Put 60K on my bitch just to make her cooler
Her attitude be hot I got to cool her
These pants so low my wrist is icy like a cooler
Your bitch just want to fuck me and my fucking jewler
