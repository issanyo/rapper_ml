[Hook: TYALAXANDAR]
I hit the bank like a lay up
I hit the bank like a lay up
I hit the bank like a lay up
I'm working hard for this paper
I rip up the beat like a savage
And Jerry come through with the package
Don't tell me you back in that action
Don't tell me you back in that action

[Verse 1: TYALAXANDAR]
I'm tryna cop me a residence
We tryna live out on Beverly
They know I put that on everything
Window all black like the President
I'm in the booth like I'm voting for him
I wanna pull up in all the foreigns
I take your team and they working for me
I hope you know that you not important
I got your girl on the regular
I take her out on the regular
I got her all in my crib, all in my fridge
Like where the ketchup is
I barely answer my messages
I don't got time, you irrelevant
Somebody get a pencil and get out of my cause you know Ima bury it
If I wasn't doing this, you'd hate me either way
Where I was born, soldiers fighting hard to see the day
So if you owe me gwop then pay up
Cause I don't have no commas soon then Ima look back at you and laugh cause

[Hook: TYALAXANDAR]
I hit the bank like a lay up
I hit the bank like a lay up
I hit the bank like a lay up

I rip up the beat like a savage
And Jerry come through with the package
Don't tell me you back in that action
Don't tell me you back in that action

[Verse 2: Claude Antonio]
All of my niggas is deadly
You know we packing it heavy
Do not let me catch you slipping
All of these foreigns I'm whipping
All of these rappers I'm killing
All of these bitches I'm kissing
My music don't ever get old
My money stacks don't ever fold
I hit the streets like a lay up
If you owe me money than pay up
I want no beef like a vegan
All of my niggas is eatin'
I ride through New Jersey like Fetty
Yeah you fuck niggas is petty
I'm fucking your bitch in my Royce
She loving the sound of my voice
I'm fucking your bitch til' the weekend
She loving it like I'm The Weeknd
I got North Bergen so turnt
We smoke until our lungs get burnt
You fake niggas don't gotta lie to me
My crew Mobb Deep like Prodigy
You know we causing that Havoc
You know I go hard like a savage
What?
201 baby
