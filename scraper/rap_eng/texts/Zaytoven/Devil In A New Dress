[Intro: Kanye West]
I love it though
I love it though, y'know?

[Hook: Tay Bouddah]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation
I know Iâ€™m preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
