Know me!
It's Gucci!

[Intro: Law]
Like they know me
Now they scream my name like they know me
Now they scream my name like they know me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I ain't LA reek
But this dope is epic
This ain't LA weed
This shit came from Texas
My whip game fast and furious
Pack gone in 60 seconds
My jewelry whirlpooling
It broke a world record
Say I'm a heart throb
She'll make a girl record
Don't turn that door knob
Might see your girl naked
I think I'm David Beckham
In them low top Giuseppes
I'm Gucci Westbrook
They don't know how to check em
You know a [?] niggas
But I need the lion's share
Standing over Versace sofas
Call it the lion chair
Say what you say, shorty
Gucci don't play, shorty
Got all this ice on
And it's a day party

[Hook: Law]
I been running plays Kyrie Irving
I treat all my bitches like I'm Goldie
Now they scream my name like they know me
Now they scream my name like they know me
I put them on cane now they owe me
Now they scream my name like they know me
Now they scream my name like they know me

[Verse 2: Law]
World stars for your television
They know I'm popping paparazzi with me
Hugh Hefner that's 100 bitches
Good life I ain't ever switching
Yeah, counting money with the Cubans
Your old bitch, went and used her
Your new bitch, still a groupie
Say she fucking with a movement
This type of sauce I'm cooking in the kitchen
I got some 90s on me, I'm drippin'
Bring that to the table then you leash it
I had to cross them over, they was reaching
This shit was made for the money, Prada
That bag you talking about, went and got it
That nigga, touchdown, took a few losses
Like a quarterback with no watchers

[Hook: Law]
I been running plays Kyrie Irving
I treat all my bitches like I'm Goldie
Now they scream my name like they know me
Now they scream my name like they know me
I put them on cane now they owe me
Now they scream my name like they know me
Now they scream my name like they know me

[Hook: Law]
I been running plays Kyrie Irving
I treat all my bitches like I'm Goldie
Now they scream my name like they know me
Now they scream my name like they know me
Now they scream my name like they know me
Now they scream my name like they know me
Now they scream my name like they know me
Now they scream my name like they know me
