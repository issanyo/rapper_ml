[Intro]
Zaytoven
It's a holiday bae-cay
It's a holiday bae-cay (Bae-cation)
A holiday bae-cay (Yeah)
A holiday bae-cation (Let's go)

[Verse 1]
Baby, I know that you love the snow
But you know our love is too hot for the cold
This year I'm feelin' so tropical
I'm feelin' like paradise
Girl let's go live our best life

[Pre-Chorus]
Just let me lay in the Garden of Eden (Let me lay-lay-lay-lay you down)
Love is in the air this season
I'll massage you from head to toe
What you waitin' for? Let's go
You can bring the mistletoe (Oh), yeah

[Chorus]
Let's get away for a holiday vacation
Somewhere on an island, a place to keep you smilin'
Baby, you, you deserve sunshine
Tanning under blue skies
As the boats go sailin' by, oh
It's a holiday bae-cation, oh
It's a holiday bae-cation, oh
A holiday bae-cation, oh
A holiday bae-cation, oh

[Verse 2]
Pina colada, with no kids to bother us
From lovin' each other, mink and no covers
Imagine Christmas on the ocean, bodies poetry in motion
It's poetry in motion

[Pre-Chorus]
(Just let me lay)
Just let me lay in the Garden of Eden (Let me lay-lay-lay-lay)
Love is in the air this season (Ooh)
I'll massage you from head to toe
What you waitin' for? Let's go
You can bring the mistletoe (Oh), yeah

[Chorus]
Let's get away for a holiday vacation
Somewhere on an island, a place to keep you smilin'
Baby, you, you deserve sunshine
Tanning under blue skies
As the boats go sailin' by, oh
It's a holiday bae-cation, oh
It's a holiday bae-cation, oh
A holiday bae-cation, oh
A holiday bae-cation, oh

[Bridge]
It's a holiday bae-cay
It's a holiday bae-cay (Bae-cation)
A holiday bae-cay (Bae-cation)
A holiday bae-cation (Let's go, let's go)
It's a holiday bae-cation, oh
It's a holiday bae-cation, oh
A holiday bae-cation, oh
A holiday bae-cation, oh

[Chorus]
Let's get away for a holiday vacation
Somewhere on an island, a place to keep you smilin'
Baby, you, you deserve sunshine
Tanning under blue skies
As the boats go sailin' by, oh

[Outro]
Woo, let's go
