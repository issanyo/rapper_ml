Starting to think that that nigga a bluff
Starting to think he pretending to be tough

In the suburb next door to a nigga named Jack
(Hi Savage can I borrow sugar?)
And I know how you got savage
Cuz you prolly punked all the white kids

Probably the year that the nigga ran track
Probably the year that the nigga turned savage
Probably the year that he decided to get tatted

Oh yeah

And like I want it this big
In the middle of my fucking head
Just square the fuck right there
So people can call me knife man
