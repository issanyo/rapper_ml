[Intro]
Zaytoven
Uh, damn, ay Zay, you know you a fool, nigga
I swear to God
Givin' this beat to Fool, nigga
God damn, lets get it

[Chorus]
I come from Burger Bobs, stolen cars
Rest in peace my Dons, they fallen stars
I might just kill thirty of 'em
Got that thirty, it get very ugly
They hatin' just to get above me
You gon die, you motherfuckin' touch me
I seen some coke, I wanna touch it
I touched it then I wanna rub it
I rubbed it then I wanna cook it
Hop on the block and I'm going straight stupid
I hang with the cluckers, the Js, and the boot
The nine let him live but the K it went through him
I'm tryin' kill your son, you better move him
Dope in from Cuba, we shop in Peru too
Shot your lil' brother, you lucky I ain't shoot you
Pull up on your mother and give her the bad news

[Verse]
Nigga, cash rules, I'm a bad dude
Slap yo mama out, bitch I'm that rude
I'm takin' everything he got, I'm that cruel
Fucked that nigga bitch, she geekin' to set up her dude
I just been toting my tool, the beef it be thicker than wool
I'm geekin' to go straight to war, I shoot 'til the shell hit the core
Fuck a rat, like a Muslim hate pork
I'm come on stage and they roar
Hop on the beat and I'm leaving it sore
Just dropped a tape and they geekin' for more
Just copped a brick and I'm gon' let it soar

[Chorus]
I come from Burger Bobs, stolen cars
Rest in peace my Dons, they fallen stars
I might just kill thirty of 'em
Got that thirty, it get very ugly
They hatin' just to get above me
You gon die, you motherfuckin' touch me
I seen some coke, I wanna touch it
I touched it then I wanna rub it
I rubbed it then I wanna cook it
Hop on the block and I'm going straight stupid
I hang with the cluckers, the Js, and the boot
The nine let him live but the K it went through him
I'm tryin' kill your son, you better move him
Dope in from Cuba, we shop in Peru too
Shot your lil' brother, you lucky I ain't shoot you
Pull up on your mother and give her the bad news

[Outro]
I'm sorry, but we had to do it
Hey, hear me
When there's work to be done, nigga, we gon' get it done
Uh, damn, shout out to Zay, uh
Rich Shootas don't play, gang
