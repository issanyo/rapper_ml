(Chorus)
Girl, you left me hurt
Please put on your skirt
Button up your shirt
Cuz this ain't gon' work
Don't I get on your last nerves
Weren't those your last words?
Should we go as we were?
Yeah

(Verse 1)
Girl, you left me hurt
Why you gotta purp?
You decide to hit me up
When you give into that urge
If we go by your terms, one of us is gonna learn
The other one is gon' get burned, the game we play, you'll get your turn
You left me for a jerk
[You] just straight up *SKKKKRRRRTTT*
He'll do you like you did me
You'll get what you deserve
Baby girl, you're just a bird
That's my bond, that's my word
Should've known better than to trust a girl with panties in her purse

(Chorus)
Girl, you left me hurt
Please put on your skirt
Button up your shirt
Cuz this ain't gon' work
Don't I get on your last nerves
Weren't those your last words?
Should we go as we were?
Yeah

(Verse 2)
You a piece of work
I said it wouldn't work
I'm ahead of the game
Hit that lame on his chirp
I won't be hurt again
We can be perfect friends
Came to my door naked
Your advances made you basic
I don't even know you no more, you acting crazy
Girl, this D ain't even no more, you have to pay me
I don't even need you no more, I got flavors
And I can pick favorites

(Chorus)
Girl, you left me hurt
Please put on your skirt
Button up your shirt
Cuz this ain't gon' work
Don't I get on your last nerves
Weren't those your last words?
Should we go as we were?
Yeah

(Outro)
You left me devastated
You never thought that I'd make it
