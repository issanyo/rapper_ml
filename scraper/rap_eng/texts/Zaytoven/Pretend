Intro
These the type of niggas we don't really fuxk wit

Verse (1)

Never seen you on the block
Only chase you been is bank
Only keys you got is car
Yo 300 ain't a wraith
You ain't from Watts, you on Firestone
You went to Locke for a day
Wrote this shit in the A
Had to cop one from Zay
The barber he edging you up
Only time that you catching a fade
Heard You in the gym losing them pounds
That don’t mean that you moving that weight
You never been to Locol…never been to Hawkins
Smelly niggas be pro-foul, might as well have a login
Time goofy that you change, gem dropping no costin
The fakest nigga in the room, the one doing all the talking
Can't forget my queens, run it back she poppin
Fakest hoe in the room, one doing all the talking

(HOOK)

See you acting like you hard
Flashin hunnas like you paid
That’s the shit’ll get you robbed
Drama come you runaway
Don’t fuck wit niggas that pretend
Don’t fuck wit niggas that pretend
Don’t fuck wit niggas that pretend
Don’t fuck wit niggas that pretend

Never bang I never killed
Never have I never will
Never claimed to be a thug
But I gotta keep it trill
Don’t fuck wit niggas that pretend
Don’t fuck wit niggas that pretend
Don’t fuck wit niggas that pretend
Don’t fuck wit niggas that pretend


Verse (2)

Been drawn on, I never been shot
You da type a nigga that’ll send cops
Don’t be fronting goofy like you know Top
Cuz in the projects u got some reeboks
….In Watts nigga Im guwop
Diddy Hov and steve jobs, im the best soon as that beat drop
Too many niggas out here they fake
Too many chicks out her show face
Where yo tongue you ain't got no taste
Its a marathon,  tryna finish that race, but youd rather marry thots  and come in 1st place
Its rap Let me slow up my pace
Got damn I be whippin that bass
One day I’ll be whippin that wraith
Not before I get mamma a place
Like nicki she say no frauds
In the hood you will get erased
….Keep it real is the song…
Only nigga that ain't TDE
That can get TOP on the phone

(HOOK)

See you acting like you hard
Flashin hunnas like you paid
That’s the shit’ll get you robbed
Drama come you runaway
Don’t fuck wit niggas that pretend
Don’t fuck wit niggas that pretend
Don’t fuck wit niggas that pretend
Don’t fuck wit niggas that pretend

Never bang I never killed
Never have I never will
Never claimed to be a thug
But I gotta keep it trill
Don’t fuck wit niggas that pretend
Don’t fuck wit niggas that pretend
Don’t fuck wit niggas that pretend
Don’t fuck wit niggas that pretend
