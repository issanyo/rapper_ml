[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
I got moves I ain't made yet, I got shows I ain't played yet
I got trips I ain't take yet, I got time I ain't fade yet
I got songs I ain't made yet, I got foes I ain't faced yet
I got hands I ain't shake yet, I got plans I ain't made yet
I got moves I ain't made yet, I got shows I ain't played yet
I got trips I ain't take yet, I got prayers I ain't prayed yet
I got songs I ain't made yet, I got foes I ain't faced yet
I got hands I ain't shake yet, I got plans I ain't made yet

[Verse 1]
Listen, I did it, I did it, I did it (I did it)
I been in these trenches a minute
'Til the end of the Earth I'ma witness
From Egypt all the way down to Sydney
I'm still hungry like I never ate
I'm making ways where there ain't a way
The devil tryin' to take my flame away
I love Kobe but no fade away
I still pull up on the block
I still watch out for dirty cops
I still tell 'em 'bout the Rock
They still hoping I'm gonna stop
Yeah, been on my grind
Yeah, yeah, all in due time
Woo, I still ain't seen King's dreams, so, until He arrives
I got some places I ain't been, you know Brazil on my A-list
Still gotta meet a few A-list, but can't nobody make me famous
April put me in a movie
They left me off of bad and boujee
But God got me feeling groovy, so I'ma show the world  new me

[Chorus]
I got moves I ain't made yet, I got shows I ain't played yet
I got trips I ain't take yet, I got time I ain't fade yet
I got songs I ain't made yet, I got foes I ain't faced yet
I got hands I ain't shake yet, I got plans I ain't made yet
I got moves I ain't made yet, I got shows I ain't played yet
I got trips I ain't take yet, I got prayers I ain't prayed yet
I got songs I ain't made yet, I got foes I ain't faced yet
I got hands I ain't shake yet, I got plans I ain't made yet

[Verse 2]
Hol' up, I am not finished
I'll let you know when I get done
Lord help me walk in humility
'Cause some of these folk acting like my sons
Talking back to me, gettin' out of pocket
Speaking numbers to me like I failed
I'm lookin' at 'em like, I prolly blazed more than you'll ever get the trail
I lost more games than you'll ever get to play, you should pay attention
I'd rather die on the battlefield than to be at home liking pictures
And I ain't finished 'til I'm dead
Then I pass it to my kids
I tell 'em "God's truth is like a virus, so give it to 'em till it spread"
This money I ain't made yet
Bought some houses in the hood
Put some families in 'em
Get some dealers jobs
Then they ain't gotta sell the goods
I don't do Perccys or Xannys
I lean on God and my Granny
It's too much work to do for me to sleep in the booth
I could sleep at the Grammys

[Chorus]
I got moves I ain't made yet, I got shows I ain't played yet
I got trips I ain't take yet, I got time I ain't fade yet
I got songs I ain't made yet, I got foes I ain't faced yet
I got hands I ain't shake yet, I got plans I ain't made yet
I got moves I ain't made yet, I got shows I ain't played yet
I got trips I ain't take yet, I got prayers I ain't prayed yet
I got songs I ain't made yet, I got foes I ain't faced yet
I got hands I ain't shake yet, I got plans I ain't made yet
