[Chorus: Trouble]
They feel like it’s an obligation, Zaytoven
I said this ain’t nothing they said we made it
I said this ain’t nothing they said we made it big
I said this ain’t nothing they said we made it [x2]
I said this ain’t nothing they said we made it big
I said this ain’t nothing I’d be like this ain’t shit
Seemed like everybody need a favor
Seemed like everybody ask for favors now

[Verse 1: Big Bank Black]
Where I'm from you get a lil' sum niggas think ya Saint Nick
Holding nuts holding grudges
Can’t believe this shit
You know my family tree pussy ya never been mob
I feel the pussy nigga vibes when I step out the car
Everybody want sum for nothing
If a nigga in my circle he ain’t gon want for nothing
Fuck what you heard on the well bitch it's still mob
Same nigga same shit we don't fuck with y’all
Nigga fuck

[Chorus: Trouble]
I said this ain’t nothing they said we made it
I said this ain’t nothing they said we made it big
I said this ain’t nothing they said we made it [x2]
I said this ain’t nothing they said we made it big
I said this ain’t nothing I’d be like this ain’t shit
Seemed like everybody need a favor
Seemed like everybody ask for favors now

[Verse 2: Trouble]
How you say you feel if ya'll ain’t even went nowhere
Momma ain't even went nowhere, sister ain't went nowhere
How you say you feel a thot and you right here with me
What is it everyday, expect me to give you somethin' for free
They expect you made it in the time you get a piece
Everybody waiting in line trying to get a piece
They all want you checking on 'em
Who checking on me
The best feeling that in the world other [?]

[Chorus: Trouble]
I said this ain’t nothing they said we made it
I said this ain’t nothing they said we made it big
I said this ain’t nothing they said we made it [x2]
I said this ain’t nothing they said we made it big
I said this ain’t nothing I’d be like this ain’t shit
Seemed like everybody need a favor
Seemed like everybody ask for favors now
