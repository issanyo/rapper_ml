[Intro]
Zaytoven
Uh, yeah
Rich vibes, clear diamonds
Clean drink, bad bitches

[Chorus]
Jewish plug named Weinstein
I ain't trippin' cause I got the bags landin'
Q Da Fool show you how to trap it out, hands free
Why these police keep tryna jam me?
You know I'm smokin' on that plant, no canopy
And I got a white bitch named Penelope
The plug say the work pure, bitch, it better be
All the shit that I done sold, my ticket hella cheap
The streets ain't the best of me

[Verse]
You gotta pay a bag just to mess with me
The MAC, and the K, and the Tec with me
They said that lil bitch was wet, but sheesh
Too much gas, a young nigga can't breathe
Got too much shit a young nigga don't need
Pulled up smokin' out with my OG
Shout out to Zay cause he playin' with the keys
Hop out the Wraith, they can't believe what they see
Big stunna, no Cash Money
Blue hundreds, bitch we want it
From the south to the north, they know we gunnin'
Watch your mouth 'round the gang 'cause we comin'
We hungry, bitch, we want it
Where that work at, bitch, we want it
Take the nine out, they cryin' now
Bitch, you really tryna die for 5 pounds
Home Depot gang, we keep a drill
I catch that case, I don't say no names, I keep it real
I shoot your ass while the other hand bear the wheel
Well when I die, I never will, I got the heart of steel
I got a hundred pounds right now in the field
Shout out the Rich Shootas, those my Navy SEALs
If I send them, man, they drumming for real
I know you a fuck, give a fuck how you feel
My kid gotta eat and my bitch want a mil'
I wanna get rich, and get head, and just chill
Kill a nigga, it's a hell of a thrill
This Rich Shoota lifestyle shit real
See my first hundred rounds like yeah
Bullets flying round like Buzz Lightyear
If you looking for the kid, lil bitch, I'm right here
And I got a .45 for the clip right here, uh
These niggas know how we comin'
Slangin' them choppers, nigga, slangin' them choppers
These niggas know where I'm from
Largo Road, got the meds like a doctor
Fuck the feds, man, them crackers ain't proper
They wash you up, hope that shit don't shock 'em
If I bust it down, man, that shit gone sparkle
Main bitch fat, watch her lil ass wobble
Still got my name in a glass bottle
And I'm still fuckin' on the last model
Fast life, bring drama, these llamas, bring

[Chorus]
Jewish plug named Weinstein
I ain't trippin' cause I got the bags landin'
Q Da Fool show you how to trap it out, hands free
Why these police keep tryna jam me?
You know I'm smokin' on that plant, no canopy
And I got a white bitch named Penelope
The plug say the work pure, bitch, it better be
All the shit that I done sold, my ticket hella cheap
The streets ain't the best of me

[Outro]
Uh, uh
Damn, uh, uh
Uh
