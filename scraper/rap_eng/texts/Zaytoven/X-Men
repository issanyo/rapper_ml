Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm, Magneto
Pull up like Professor X and I got my grey jeans on
I ride up like Iceman, I hop out like Sabertooth
I come through like Rouge, boy I ain't finna play with you
X-Men, X-Men, X-Men I think I'm with X-Men
I think I'm with the X-Men, I'm a X-Men member, nigga I'm a X-Men member

[Verse 1]
Since you blue you can be Raven Mystique
This bitch Toad how she's licking on me
Bitch I'm Pyro therefore heater on me
Can't trust a bitch she do you like Jubilee
I don't care if she's fine as Jean Grey
I know she got that Kitty Pryde but she gon' let me bang
That bitch is a Lady Deathstrike
You should know X-Men like left right

[Verse 2]
Bitch says that she's bad I'm like stop it
That's like saying Batman versus Robin
I know we talking X-Men, but I'm gonna switch it over
I pulled up laughing like Joker your bitch she doing yoga
I know that I'm a X-Men, ain't I?
But my car got a Batman fender
That bitch I been hit that man
I got her in my car and she hopping out like she got some Batman in her
I come through Kamehameha like Goku
I'm flexing like Gohan at a damn photo shoot
If I turn to Piccolo you tofu
Bitch my name Vegeta I don't know you
This the trilogy and you the last man standing
The days of future passed you's a damn origin
My life's a movie, wide screen
I think I got a X on my time piece
