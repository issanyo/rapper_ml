[Intro]
Yeah, Young Juice in this motherfucker
32 Entertainment, baby
Bouldercrest working all day
Sun Valley Shawty
Texaco Shawty
Believe that, believe that

[Hook]
One is for the money and two is for the show
Three is for the ice that got me gliding on the floor
With VVS karts, got me sliding in your hoe
I'm swagging out the Coupe with the swanga Lambo door

[Verse 1]
Lambo door Cutlass, Lambo door Benz
It's only two-seater 'cause the Juice don't need no friends
On a solo mission, counting up them stupid ends
In the club, spot one, tell her to bring her friends
And it's back to the trap and I'ma do they ass in
While I'm still making plays, selling splits by the ten
Man, it's Prada shoe walking 'cause crack done got me in
Bust a whole brick down, then do that shit again
It's Young Juiceman AKA Swagger Right
I'ma post up in the club, chain reflecting off the lights
I'ma keep some blocks, four, just like some rolling dice
Never move out the hood, just like the streetlights
Staying down for the gwap, paper chasing all the time
If you looking for the Juice, you can catch me on the grind
Staying down for the gwap, paper chasing all the time
If you looking for the Juice, you can catch me on the grind

[Hook]
One is for the money and two is for the show
Three is for the ice that got me gliding on the floor
With VVS karts, got me sliding in your hoe
I'm swagging out the Coupe with the swanga Lambo door
One is for the money and two is for the show
Three is for the ice that got me gliding on the floor
With VVS karts, got me sliding in your hoe
I'm swagging out the Coupe with the swanga Lambo door

[Verse 2]
One is for the money and two is for the show
Three is for the ice that got me gliding in your hoe
With all these multicolors, got me cleaner than some soap
When it's time to re-up, man, they bring it on a boat
With all these extra grams, got my pocket like a float
If a nigga cross me out, then I'll play a cutthroat
I'ma backstabbing fool when it comes down to dope
So don't try to play me wrong, boy, your body won't float
Then back to the trap, bubble things, some purple smoke
'88 box Chevy, 26-inch floats
'07 Charger on some Davin floats
I'ma get to the money, whether rain, sleet, or snow
It's Young Juiceman, I used to trap at Texaco
But I still sell dope, yeah, I still sell dope
It's Young Juiceman, I used to trap at Texaco
But I still sell dope, yeah, I still sell dope

[Hook]
One is for the money and two is for the show
Three is for the ice that got me gliding on the floor
With VVS karts, got me sliding in your hoe
I'm swagging out the Coupe with the swanga Lambo door
One is for the money and two is for the show
Three is for the ice that got me gliding on the floor
With VVS karts, got me sliding in your hoe
I'm swagging out the Coupe with the swanga Lambo door

[Verse 3]
I pull up to the club and I'm swagging out the Coupe
All four pockets full 'cause you know I got that juice
Man, it's money walking through the club, they call me Young Juice
And I'm ice water whipping 'cause you know the kid the truth, nigga
Coogi outfit or I'm rocking Linen suit
With a VVS chain, damn-near see through
With some rims so big, you stick your kids straight through
And my ring and watch keeps your boy with a diamond flu
When I step up in the club, pockets twenty times two
Man, swag so nasty plus my middle finger blue
Man, I'm dry water whipping, dog, what about you?
It's Young Juiceman and my swag so true
Baked tilapia mixed in with wild fruit
It's Mr. Nieman Marcus shopping, walking Prada shoes
It's Mr. Nieman Marcus shopping, walking Prada shoes
Baked tilapia mixed in with lemon juice

[Hook]
One is for the money and two is for the show
Three is for the ice that got me gliding on the floor
With VVS karts, got me sliding in your hoe
I'm swagging out the Coupe with the swanga Lambo door
One is for the money and two is for the show
Three is for the ice that got me gliding on the floor
With VVS karts, got me sliding in your hoe
I'm swagging out the Coupe with the swanga Lambo door
One is for the money and two is for the show
Three is for the ice that got me gliding on the floor
With VVS karts, got me sliding in your hoe
