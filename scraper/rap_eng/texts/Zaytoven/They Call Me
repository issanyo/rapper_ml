[Intro]
Yeah
Young Juice, 32 Entertainment
Aye, and we popping off the chain, dog
Every time you see me (okay, aye)

[Hook]
They call me Young Juice, I am the damn truth
(I'm ice water whipping, dog, what about you?)
They call me Young Juice, I am the damn truth
(I'm ice water whipping, dog, what about you?)

[Verse 1]
I'm ice water whipping in the kitchen, flipping mammy
Glass house drop, look like white mayonnaise
Posted in the trap with a chopper that do hand sprays
Try to rob the 32 and you will do back weights
Next day in M.I.A. on the oceanway
Hunting for a plug, you can hustle a million different ways
New connect with white, ten stacks for them things
Stacks full of babies and I'm ice water whipping, mane
Pills for the low, pounds for a stack
Shop with Juiceman, you will make your money back
You fucking with a young untamed gorilla
That's all about trapping, trying to stack another million
And with no children, I'm balling out of control
I bought a '84 and sat that bitch on 24's
I'm riding past you niggas and I'm picking up your hoes
Embassy Suite, nigga, man, you know how pimping goes
Young Juiceman and my money comes out of [?]
You can imitate, but my flow is ice cold
My neck and wrist, too, so what about you?
I'm getting money, dog, so go flip a bird or two

[Hook]
They call me Young Juice, I am the damn truth
(I'm ice water whipping, dog, what about you?)
They call me Young Juice, I am the damn truth
(I'm ice water whipping, dog, what about you?)

[Verse 2]
They call me Crayon 'cause my cars are colorful
I'm in the kitchen cooking and my dope is colorful
Right hand shawty and my grams is wonderful
Dry water whipping got me living like Stunna do
"Ball and stay fly", that's the motto that I live by
Pissy jewelry leave your main bitch with the pinkeye
Blue and yellow Jordan touched with a little tiedye
Fruity color Bathing Apes same color as Popeye's
'68 Impala on some rims that sit how high
'07 Sport Rover with the [?] tires
White zips and bales same color as my rims
I'm riding past your bitch in a '06 Lamb
Two-door Maserati, paint it red, pearly ten
28 [?] rims on some chrome silly bands
Watching for the snake, the eyes quicker than the hand
I make more plays than [?] man

[Hook]
They call me Young Juice, I am the damn truth
(I'm ice water whipping, dog, what about you?)
They call me Young Juice, I am the damn truth
(I'm ice water whipping, dog, what about you?)
