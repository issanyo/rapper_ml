[Intro]
Ch'yeah
Aye, Young Juice
32 Entertainment, okay
Okay, aye, aye

[Chorus]
Cop a chicken, dog, for the 18
Same number, Peyton Manning for the Colts team
Then I hit your block with that straight drop
Three grams for the 50 will have your block hot
Cop a chicken, dog, for the 18
Same number, Peyton Manning for the Colts team
Then I hit your block with that straight drop
Three grams for the 50 will have your block hot

[Verse]
I got a half-a-brick Chevy, million pills Buick
Stacked up chickens, same color as the groupies
Blue colored diamonds, same color as the movies
Rolling up the kushy, don't it taste fruity?
Three gram slabs will keep your trap moving
Doing big numbers like I am shooting a movie
Count big stacks, what I call trap booming
Necklace and bracelet, look like blessed by Rudy
Riding 28's down 20 in a dually
With four bad bitches, chain swinging, how I do it
Peyton Manning numbers got me boosting my endurance
The young traps got my shit steady moving

[Chorus]
Cop a chicken, dog, for the 18
Same number, Peyton Manning for the Colts team
Then I hit your block with that straight drop
Three grams for the 50 will have your block hot
Cop a chicken, dog, for the 18
Same number, Peyton Manning for the Colts team
Then I hit your block with that straight drop
Three grams for the 50 will have your block hot
