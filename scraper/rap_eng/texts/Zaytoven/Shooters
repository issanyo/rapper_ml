[Chorus]
It's some shooters on my squad
It's some shooters on my squad
If he holding on that work
Then that pussy get robbed
It's some shooters on my squad
It's some shooters on my squad
All my niggas shoot like Ray Ray
Call them shooting guards
It's some shooters on my squad
It's some shooters on my squad
If he holding on that work
Then that pussy get robbed
It's some shooters on my squad
It's some shooters on my squad
All my niggas shoot like Ray Ray
Call them shooting guards

[Verse 1: RondoNumbaNine]
See it's some shooters from D-Block
Steve drive the real D-Block
CDai got 22 shots
Matter fact he got a mop
Booka put 'em in a box
Tay 600 shoot off his top
When we on them fucking blocks
They know 600 got them jocks
I don't care about Lil Jay
No I don't care what he say
If I see him, heat his face
Like my nigga Durk say
Know L'A he gone spray
Niggas know Lil Dee'll spray
Send shots everyday
It's our way or no way
Tell em get up out my face
Edai, he don't play
Niggas know we GDK
See a brick and drop them rakes
See it's no lacking in our hood
In traffic busting juggs
And I got that Mac-11
So I wish a nigga would
See Duck ain't on shit
I'll wet his outfit
Niggas know Rondo
Make it tragic

[Chorus]
It's some shooters on my squad
It's some shooters on my squad
If he holding on that work
Then that pussy get robbed
It's some shooters on my squad
It's some shooters on my squad
All my niggas shoot like Ray Ray
Call them shooting guards
It's some shooters on my squad
It's some shooters on my squad
If he holding on that work
Then that pussy get robbed
It's some shooters on my squad
It's some shooters on my squad
All my niggas shoot like Ray Ray
Call them shooting guards

[Verse 2: L'A Capone]
It's some shooters in my clique
Rondo let's go do a hit
I'm 'bout to empty half the clip
But you just lay low in the dip
You know they always be running
I'm a catch him every rip
He talking slick his vocal cords I'm a rip
He can't run from the hollow tip
He can't hide from me
A lot of them shooters gone ride with me
I gotta keep the main thing on the side of me
Tried to look at the time, almost blinded me
Them Glocks, that's my cup of tea
We be shooting shit so she wanna fuck with me
30 clip be sealed where the buckle be
And I'm a savage, so don't put your trust in me
M-Thang in the back, load the 50 up
Can't lack, won't lack, keep a 50 tucked
And everywhere they go, they remember us
Stean Dean, your block, we bend it up
Y'all know O-Block gone send it up
300 Moe Block gone send it up
When we ride, we ride with the windows up
Cause them opp-ass niggas be quick to duck
Got a homie named Mak, heâ€™ll line you up
One false move boy, and the nine is up
Fuck a opp, money ladder, 'til we climbing up
She wanna fuck me, you know I'm declining her
Give me top give me top, I ain't smashing her
For Lil Steve, D-Thang we spazzing out
Took a ride through the Nine with the ratchets up
You talking slick all day, what you talking for?

[Chorus]
It's some shooters on my squad
It's some shooters on my squad
If he holding on that work
Then that pussy get robbed
It's some shooters on my squad
It's some shooters on my squad
All my niggas shoot like Ray Ray
Call them shooting guards
It's some shooters on my squad
It's some shooters on my squad
If he holding on that work
Then that pussy get robbed
It's some shooters on my squad
It's some shooters on my squad
All my niggas shoot like Ray Ray
Call them shooting guards
