[Intro: Shy Glizzy]
Young Jefe holmes!

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
When I walk out my house I got my glizzy on my hip
Just in case a pussy nigga try to hit a lick
Few problems I've never had and that was money and a bitch
Feeling just like Nino I got bitches whippin' bricks
We just didn't fit, had to cancel that bitch
She wasn't good for shit, went on and cancelled that bitch
We couldn't get no money so I cancelled that bitch
Ain't get along with momma had to cancel that bitch

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Get down on your knees, Jefe baby please
She ain't tryna fuck me so I told that bitch to leave
You ain't met a G until you fuck with double G
Bad foreign piece, ooh she took me overseas
I had a lil' black bitch and she kept it a 100
But she was too friendly so I sent her back to London
Don't get in all that bogus shit 'cuz I know they just frontin'
No that ain't my brother smoke his ass just like G Money
I got plenty money, and I got plenty haters
I can't do you no favors if you can't do me no favors
That stick bitch at my table
Riding around with ACEs
My Harlem joint my favorite
No no no she not basic

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
When I walk out my house I got my glizzy on my hip
Just in case a pussy nigga try to hit a lick
Few problems I've never had and that was money and a bitch
Feeling just like Nino I got bitches whippin' bricks
We just didn't fit, had to cancel that bitch
She wasn't good for shit, went on and cancelled that bitch
We couldn't get no money so I cancelled that bitch
Ain't get along with momma had to cancel that bitch

[Verse 2: Sauce Walka]
I'm Saaaauce
Bitch get out of my car
Who do you think that you are
Bitch you ain't Nicki Minaj
Bitch you ain't Vivica Fox, and if you is I don't give a damn
'Cuz the money come first you can save the attitude for Instagram
I had the fire the ho, I had to retire the ho
2000 in the whole week, bitch your legs movin' too slow
You ain't applying yourself
Always lookin' out for your friends but you gotta pay bills by yourself
So who is taking the L
But you want the new Chanel
Want the crystals on your nails
But the bitches with you ain't gon' get it and you always with 'em so you fail
Got you thinking like a square
Fuckin' niggas 'cuz he say he care
No you lost your house and he ain't there
Now you working out a hotel
I'm Saaaauce

[Verse 3: SosaMann]
Had to cancel lil' momma
She wasn't getting no gwala
And she tryna give me drama
That's a no, no, no way, Jose, not today
Want to fuck with So, gotta pay
Hard on 'em, working like a slave
I was trapping hard, broad day
Met a bitch she wasn't good for nun'
In my whip pushing all the buttons
Had to kick her up out the foreign, woah
Now I make it out to splash bills and to fucking drip
To DC 'bout to take a trip
And go and kick it with Shy 'nem
A pool of sauce I just dive in
Two pumps and that pistol grip, damn
Run up nigga get blammed, Glizzy Gang that's my fam
In the trap was gettin' bands, woah
No more selling dope
But the nigga still keep the pole, boom, boom
