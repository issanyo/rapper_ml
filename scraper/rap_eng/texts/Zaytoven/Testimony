[Verse 1: 1K Phew]
Look Atlanta that's where I'm from
He took me out the slum
Cause he want me to serve no folks
But when that temper touch my thumb
I tryna eat with every crumb
Feeling so cold I never unthaw
Jugging round the city for a paycheck
With that double cut was on me
I was in all night flexing
Tell then dudes I wasn't with the basics
But then I got tired and paceless
I got to get my life some braces
Goodness graces can't believe I was
In that places Now I ride for my
Go hard for my Ya I provide for my

[Hook: 1K Phew]
Thank God for my testimony
Testimony

[Verse 2: Jor'Dan Armstrong]
Testify can't hold it tight Hallelujah to one who reign
Testimony got a hundred of those
I've been through it all
Shoutout to the club
Everybody in the mood
Could have been dead and gone
See you in the funerals
Use to go hard on the liquor
Had to get every drop
Going hard nonstop
Leading the club four o'clock
Woke then went off to church Jesus put me to work
I could never test a lot
Jesus is the reason I serve
I'm happy to still be alive
Serving the God above
Serving him till I die
No matter what they tell
Headed to the top
I'ma lift your name up high
Don't know what you saying
I thank God for life

[Hook: 1K Phew]
Thank God for my testimony
Testimony
Yeah I got a testimony
Testimony
Everywhere look I see a blessing aye
Flick your neighbors in the face in say
Everywhere look I see a blessing aye
Everywhere look I see a blessing aye
