Trap season, i wake up out the bed, count dat money twice
Its a habit now, i dont wanna break it, more like feed it
Got dis thick lil chocolate bitch from florida dat lil bitch dere needy
I thank God before i hit dat door I’m blessed cause I’m still breathing, got my heater on i need it
I play safe cause these boys greedy
Them lil ghetto babies listening cuss and they repeat
I been tryna take this shit from here way up to the top
I done customed all my jewelry I’m saving for some rocks
I was benz rolling, for i gotta deal
I ain't gotta deal
Yo girl favorite rapper
Call me santa cause i had her sitting on my lap
Eastside on the map
Dj bring it back… 


I'm the hardest one (4x)

Hooked it up wit Zay, 
I'm the hardest one
20 bands a play, 
I'm the hardest one, 

I'm the hardest one (4x)
Eastside on the map, 
I'm the hardest one
Million dollar trap, 
I'm the hardest one 

Mines the fattest sacks
I’m just spitting facts
That lil bit couldn’t talk rite she kept saying yacks
Told her this a yacht
Always keep a knot
Boy yo heart is rot
U still date a thot
I’ma make a film, stunt for my lil kids
All that dirt i did, was a dirty kid, now i ride clean huh
Dis dat triple beam
Dis dat billie jean
Pull up on the scene
I’m the hardest one, super solid g, she spilled her lil tea
Wat u want from me.. 

I'm the hardest one (4x)

Hooked it up wit Zay, 
I'm the hardest one
20 bands a play, 
I'm the hardest one, 

I'm the hardest one (4x)
Eastside on the map, 
I'm the hardest one
Million dollar trap, 
I'm the hardest one
