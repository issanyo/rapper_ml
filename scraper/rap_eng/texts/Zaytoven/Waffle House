I be sayin' "Bitch don't mess around"
Cause if you mess around
Bitch I'm a dip you through the town
About 3 A.M bitch meet me at the Waffle House
And if you show up then bitch I know you're gettin' down
I be sayin' "Bitch don't mess around"
Cause if you mess around
Bitch I'm a dip you through the town
About 3 A.M bitch meet me at the Waffle House
And if you show up then bitch I know you're gettin' down

From the depths and the rep from a 24/7 rap cat matchin flow is cashin'
The way you click your heels you like to do it with a passion
Don't worry about the paper
I can manage you precisely
My heart might be cold but the ism kinda icy
You got it goin' on now do I have to shake something?
She with her home girl so I don't' have to say nothin'
I campaign everything
Yeah I like to floss
I never shop at Ross and yo I never check the cost
She comin through the door man I think chosen up
In all the City blazed you might see me cruisin' up
Man I don't say nothing, man my car do all the talkin
And all it really says is
"Bitch, you shouldn't be walkin, would you hop in?"

I be sayin' "Bitch don't mess around"
Cause if you mess around
Bitch I'm a dip you through the town
About 3 A.M bitch meet me at the Waffle House
And if you show up then bitch I know you're gettin' down
I be sayin' "Bitch don't mess around"
Cause if you mess around
Bitch I'm a dip you through the town
About 3 A.M bitch meet me at the Waffle House
And if you show up then bitch I know you're gettin' down

From the depth and the rep from a 24/7 rap cat known to match that
Brand new Benz yo I had to cop that
Straight up game and I'm known to drop that

A lot of money man and I'm known to count that
Whatcha really wanna know about that?
Being outta pocket is not about that
Six foot money maker I'm glad I found that
A Choosey Susie and I'm glad I clowned that
Man I really like to maximize
And somebody flies to collect the prize
And always looking for the best to buy
And clients old as Bob Barker
Nerdy like Peter Parker
Supa dupa bad when the money unfold
I let that bitch buy my clothes, my wife beaters my cologne
No new trick can take you home
I don't care if it's Al Capone
Flip the chips and flip the tricks
Then call another on the phone
Break it down like Indica
Man they all gonna wanna be a friend of ya
But makin' sure that they spending ya
Don't be telling people man that's kin to ya, shit
And do it man like a Kobe shot
Man it's my team winnin you like it or not
You can parlay at all the new hot spots
With all the Bentleys, Beamers and them drop tops
We like the newest clothes and keep an eye out for the newest hoes
My favorites color green and gold
Bitch you gotta money pose

I be sayin' "Bitch don't mess around"
Cause if you mess around
Bitch I'm a dip you through the town
About 3 A.M bitch meet me at the Waffle House
And if you show up then bitch I know you're gettin' down
I be sayin' "Bitch don't mess around"
Cause if you mess around
Bitch I'm a dip you through the town
About 3 A.M bitch meet me at the Waffle House
