[Verse 1: V-Nasty]
7 60, gettin shofered in the backseat
That boy got bars, you can't catch me
East Oakland, trappin in the back streets
I'm on you when I see you, fuck rap beef
What the fuck you talkin bout
30 50s, Stoclend, bitch, I make you walk it out
Bro, you know we foakin, there ain't nothin to talk about
If you wanna fuck with me, then my brothers bring them choppers out
I knock you down, you can't play with me
If your bitch payin, she payin me
I'm doin me, she doin she
I'm off 2, she off 1, we off 3
I'm mobbin, bitch, I'm on TV
She sleep with you, but she dream of me
This Codeine, Promethezeen, I'm a feend
Bro, I can't get enough, I just lean

[Chorus: V-Nasty]
I just lean, I just lean
What's in my cup, I just lean
I just lean, I just lean
Can't get enough, I just lean

[Verse 2: V-Nasty]
Wake up in the morning, syrup in the fridge
That's my favorite thing I like to kiss
I don't need you, my syrup my bitch
Purple kind, girl, I like that Activis
I hit the mall, just to turn my swag up
Hella shoes, hella snapbacks, that shit add up
2 bitches, they hold my bags
Walk outside, to valay keys to the Jag
Gettin money now, I think they mad
Need some purple, so you know I put it to the track
Window bunkin, my people funkin
Fuck with Brick Squad, rest in piece, Slim Dunkin
I'm doin numbers, I'm gettin stacks
Pockets lookin right, cause that bitch bring it back
Mozerati black, Bentley white
Bitch, I'm doin hella shit, off my purple Spright

[Chorus: V-Nasty]
I just lean, I just lean
What's in my cup, I just lean
I just lean, I just lean
Can't get enough, I just lean

[Verse 3: Quise Tha Criminal]
We just lean, I'm finally free
I'm sippin syrup, keepin bitches with low heen
Ar coan 9, poll 16
Feelin like I'm winnin, call me Charlie Sheen
Crazy DB, god, it's livin the dream
Could've got killed, but I'm here, nigga, what the fuck you mean
My black team, droppin bodies on you people
My lil niggas sick, my lil niggas sick
I'm a goon like Plies, my max y
Gotta get this money, it's the color of my eyes
I'm high off a bean, hard headed
Mama, child trippin through relations, pay up
No time for the location, too much paper to be makin
Hey Nasty, call up Gucci, think it's time for a vacation
ATL, ATL, here I come, better get ready
I got Ps for the shauty, and my sister Betty

[Chorus: V-Nasty]
I just lean, I just lean
What's in my cup, I just lean
I just lean, I just lean
Can't get enough, I just lean
