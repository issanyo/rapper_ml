[Intro]
Zaytoven
Zay on the keys, Zay got them keys goin' crazy like forreal
Yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Remember when they wasn't supportin', now they make me feel important
Nigga straight kilt Zay beats, they gon give my nigga a warrant
Baby I'ma G like Warren, marble on all my floorin'
Nigga can't sleep on this, we don't tolerate no snorin'
Bet ya gon wake up now, bet ya gon wake up now
Bet ya gon wake up now, we don't tolerate no snorin'
Bet ya gon wake up now, bet ya gon wake up now
Bet ya gon wake up now, mama knowin' all my flowin'

[Verse 1]
Pull up in a whip that's foreign, white gold shit look hundred
Pop say you got it you flaunt it, real shit got it if you want it
Nigga want what you got, they don't wanna do what you did
I'ma put [?] disappear, might even pull up a whip
Pass me the ball I'm scorin', pushin big weight no bow flex
Couple niggas down like four flats, I was stayin' down like floor mat
Winter time come for the grind, summer time shine like big Ball
Stupid on time no tick tock, really came out of the mud
Street killa scene like Dipset, chain on froze my wrist hit
Told me that the grind gon pay off, we don't ever that we took that
2018 we kilt that, nigga no cap or bend
Really break bread wit my kin, five hundred cash my Benz

[Chorus]
Remember when they wasn't supportin', now they make me feel important
Nigga straight kilt Zay beats, they gon give my nigga a warrant
Baby I'ma G like Warren, marble on all my floorin'
Nigga can't sleep on this, we don't tolerate no snorin'
Bet ya gon wake up now, bet ya gon wake up now
Bet ya gon wake up now, we don't tolerate no snorin'
Bet ya gon wake up now, bet ya gon wake up now
Bet ya gon wake up now, marble on all my floorin'

[Verse 2]
Man I spent, me a quarter, icy shit, in the gutter
Plenty swing, make it look effortless, boy I'm not doin' ya pussy for you
Paid my [?] fully paid, I'ma crip fully laid, bitch I got bigger problems like the dishes
Give me a maid to cook and feed my fishes, bout to takeover like '99
I got ya bitch in a fine wine, I got the puff and that cloud nine
This one for L-Town and the Dec, came in the gate love and respect
Eastside I'ma drop, nigga can't even get a job, middle finger up to the max
I done been disappointed, baby don't be [?]
Tell ya that faith gon pay off, really a disadvantage
Tell ya go call Atlantic, mall hit shit no cap though
Kilt this shit organic, can't take nun for granted

[Chorus]
Remember when they wasn't supportin', now they make me feel important
Nigga straight kilt Zay beats, they gon give my nigga a warrant
Baby I'ma G like Warren, marble on all my floorin'
Nigga can't sleep on this, we don't tolerate no snorin'
Bet ya gon wake up now, bet ya gon wake up now
Bet ya gon wake up now, we don't tolerate no snorin'
Bet ya gon wake up now, bet ya gon wake up now
Bet ya gon wake up now, marble on all my floorin'
