[Hook x2]
All my bitches love me cause I put in work
How these niggas trapping they ain't got no work
Dropped right out of school ain't like to do my work
Fuck a 9 to 5, I'm clocking in that work

[Verse 1]
I just hit a lick now I'm up on a plane
If she in my phone then you know she a pain
I was in the trap bumping that Gucci Mane
Boy yo ass still broke cause nigga you a lame
Cut some niggas off 'cause they just wanted fame
If you ain't talking money you running game
I can't smoke yo shit, you know I got that flame
And if you snort my white you gon' scream [?]
I'm dripping like muddy, she gave me the cuddy
I fuck her I pass her right back to my buddy
I'm counting these ratchets relax flipping packs getting money
I do what I want while you do what you can
Don't want yo bitch boy that bitch is a fan
You know just that bitch I'm getting them bands
I got these hoes sending hearts on my gram

[Hook x2]
All my bitches love me cause I put in work
How these niggas trapping they ain't got no work
Dropped right out of school ain't like to do my work
Fuck a 9-5, I'm clocking in that work

[Outro]
No, sorry How dare you think I was just going to go away easy like that
What the fuck, like what the fuck
I won't like... the world doesn't work like that
What you talking about
