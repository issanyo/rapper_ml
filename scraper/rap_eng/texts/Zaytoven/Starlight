[Verse 1: SenseiATL]
Getting to the funds, I ain't got no time to fuss
I might skrt off in the Cutlass with the roof cut
In my Robin jeans, I might just rob the scene
Got this bitch stretched out like a limousine
Taking off like I'm fucking Johnny Quest
Ice up on me dripping like a fucking cold sweat
I might pour a four but I always keep my nine tucked
When I get the check, diamonds dancing like Puff

[Verse 2: Randy]
Gas looking like Reptar, up in my laboratory
Yeah Randy Dexter, balling like Drexler
Flexing like a wrestler, cuff her if her neck hard
With my cell, no Splinter, feed her dick for dinner
The fuck you mean what my name is?
Randy pass that dope like a damn pop quick
Randy Wall the wizard, keep a OZ like the Wizard
Randy fucking Jones slide on your bitch just like base
Yung Boi got that paper pocket, looking like a bookcase

[Verse 3: Larry]
Starlight, starbright on my neck
All these stars, they seem to flex
Getting bothered by this stalker, why she so obsessed
Cause I brought them bucks with me, fuck what these lames might get
I was leaning on my buddy, he was leaning out his head
And it ain't no technically, man you know I got that tech
Cruising these bands ain't none for you
Too many friends, is turning to fu
I told him the truth now he in a mood
I front you the sack, but you ain't my dude (Antonio Brickz)
