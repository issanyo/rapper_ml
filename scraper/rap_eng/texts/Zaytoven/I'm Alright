[Hook]
I ain't begging nobody, please don't show me no sympathy
You ain't gotta give a penny
No handouts and that's fine with me
I'm alright
I'm alright
So good
I don't need no favors
Fuck you and your handouts, I did it all myself
Myself
Myself

[Verse 1]
So good, no care in the world
My children eating, I ain't got no girl
If I had one wish in this cold world, I'd bring back G Baby
Have him with 3 ladies
Probably tell him to cool out in the streets
Give him some Hennessey and watch him earl
I'm in charge of old shit, look at me now
If my father's looking down, I'm making him proud
Coppers see me on the block and shaking me down
What you think of me now?
Am I the same old rap star that you see on TV?
With a big old smile and big ass chain, no rentals now
I did it all myself to keep my fam outta danger
I-95, yeah I see them rangers
And the Lord knows I did it for my family so therefore I'm still watched by angels

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All aboard that money train, I just came with the transporter
Gladys Knight, midnight, on a one way ticket on the way to Georgia
And once I get there, I'ma just sit there
And think about the cities that play my shit there
And think about New York, like what did I get there?
The niggas they play now don't even live there
Cameras on me, interview me
Is that to show how the people view me?
I spit it for all of y'all to get to know me
Take it and have it, you don't owe me
Open the door for you to get to know me
I love my fans, every one I go meet
I'm a soldier nigga, stand on my own feet
P.S. dot dot, the one and only, Frenchie

[Hook]
