Make it work 
Zay on the track so ima Make it work
These niggas talkin shit but they dnt want no work
Yo bitch on my dick so ima make her squirt

Elly on the beat know I go bananas
This zanotti swag I don't fuck wit sandals
Paparazzi snappin better pose for the cameras
This is paper view better change the channel
These niggas watchin me I swear I'm so sickening
Get u some money nigga mind your business
All I do is PlugTalk better take a listen
Bicken back being bool wit that pyrex vision
All this dirty money keep the bandz in a shoe box
All designer kicks & I don’t rock tube socks
Boy I keep the Riley I ain't talkin boondocks
Ima make it work cuz I only got two shots
Pull up on a nigga bullets run rite through ya
Band up off swipes and a didn't have to move rocks
That 06 Gucci and I scream free Guwop
Elly makaveli I'm the DMV 2Pac
The way I make it work you can call me diddy
See I kill any beat watch me get busy
I be out here ballin like the Memphis grizzlys
Ya boy shootin jays just like Doug christie
The juugs I be pullin I swear they so risky
I still gotta crush on the girl miss sixty
Cuz her long blonde hair make her look so pretty
But I would never do her jus like bobby & Whitney
If his money rite tell him fuck wit me
There's two kinds of rich & I'm tryna get filthy
Call me V-I-C on the beat I get silly
Juugin & finessin I'm the plug of the city
