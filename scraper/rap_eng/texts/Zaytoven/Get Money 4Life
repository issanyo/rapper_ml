You a fuckin' fraud, you ain't a real nigga
I'm a big dawg, you a lil nigga
I got some real goons, they like to kill niggas
I had to leave that hoe alone I couldn't deal with her
I'm just a young nigga from the Southside
I'm rockin' with my niggas from the Northside
A nigga play with us yeah and they gon' die
Ain't no fucking going broke get money for life
