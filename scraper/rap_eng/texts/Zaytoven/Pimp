We slaughter her, your daughter

[Verse 1]
Ll up in yo trap niggas scatter like roaches
All my close friends drug dealers and vultures
I'm sippin' out a coffee cup but this ain't Folgers
I know you still mad about the brick that I sold
I cook me up a brick and went and bought me a Rollsie
Im playin' with the rock like my real name is HOVA
AK-47 still strapped to my shoulder
Them niggas tote choppers like them niggas from Magnolia
I fucked a nigga's bitch
I fucked another nigga's bitch
When you gettin' money you can fuck a nigga's bitch
VVS diamonds I done flooded out my wrist
I ain't talkin bout Toronto when I say I'm in the 6

[Hook]
You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When you tryna get this money for a brick
Reaching in your pocket feelin' lit
Fuck that I'm running off with niggas' shit
All the codeine and gas money spent
You had bands now you ain't even got a zip
All your homeboys fuckin' on your bitch
Fuck that you better take a nigga's shit

[Verse 2]
Take a nigga's shit you better take a nigga's shit
I just took a nigga's shit and flooded out my wrist
Rappin' ass nigga you ain't really with the shit
You ain't never sold no coke and you ain't never hit a lick
You drove all the way from Macon thought he came to buy a brick
But we stripped him left him naked he had nothing but his dick
Man we pull up like the Secret Service nothin bout no sticks
Mess with 21 Savage they gon put you on a list

[Hook]
You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When you tryna get this money for a brick
Reaching in your pocket feelin' lit
Fuck that I'm running off with niggas' shit
All the codeine and gas money spent
You had bands now you ain't even got a zip
All your homeboys fuckin' on your bitch
Fuck that you better take a nigga's shit
