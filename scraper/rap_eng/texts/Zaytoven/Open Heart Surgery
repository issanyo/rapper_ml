[Chorus]
My whip just had open heart surgery
If you're 18, got a CID
Walked about a Lanax with them bags, luxuries
You love ripped my heart outta my body
I pushed up on you in that 2015
I had rags in my rubber jeans
Won't let no bitch nigga ocho, cinco me
Your love's got me blind, boy I'm tryna see

[Verse 1]
I got options boy, I'm popping boy
I'm popping, I got options boy
I'm a girl with many cards
Sick body, I go hard
Beat a bitch like ocho, cinco
My money's straight, I'm past the wrinkles
I got bots way, I'm a diva
Boy I got more spots than a cheetah
I hate that fuck nigga, some cheater
I'm counting up money
My crew thugging, and why beat us
I'll take a charge for a nigga like Visa

[Chorus]
My whip just had open heart surgery
If you're 18, got a CID
Walked about a Lanax with them bags, luxuries
You love ripped my heart outta my body
I pushed up on you in that 2015
I had rags in my rubber jeans
Won't let no bitch nigga ocho, cinco me
Your love's got me blind, boy I'm tryna see

[Verse 2]
200 on the whip
Playing with Doritos while I'm cashing in my chips
I'm getting to the money, I done supersized my fries
Why I pull up, my doors go up, my whip play smooth inside
What you know 'bout me? Don't know nothing 'bout you
But you know my swagger feel like chicken noodle soup
What you know 'bout coupes and Audis with no roofs?
My X6 panoramic sitting roof

[Chorus]
My whip just had open heart surgery
If you're 18, got a CID
Walked about a Lanax with them bags, luxuries
You love ripped my heart outta my body
I pushed up on you in that 2015
I had rags in my rubber jeans
Won't let no bitch nigga ocho, cinco me
Your love's got me blind, boy I'm tryna see
