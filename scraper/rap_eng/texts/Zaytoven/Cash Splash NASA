[Intro]
Zaytoven
Yeah, you know, they be in VIP
Drinks on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Them Club bitches, them club bitches
Club bitches, them club bitches
Have fun with 'em, and what? Wanna run with 'em
They gon' raise our future, give love to them, show love
Club bitches, them club bitches
They just only want, what they got? Only got one wish, one wish
Have fun with us, and what? Wanna run with us
We play in the jacuzzi, we bubblin' nigga (oh woah)

[Chorus]
With a quarter million cash in the bathtub (cash)
Champagne splash in the bathtub (splash)
I'm out in my new swag, NASA (NASA)
City on my back, need a back rub (oh woah)
Quarter million cash in the bathtub (cash)
Champagne splash in the bathtub (splash)
I'm out in my new swag, NASA (NASA)
City on my back, need a back rub (oh woah)

[Verse 1]
Gotta call my club bitch, she a fun bitch
She high class, not a bum bitch
She like to whip that Wraith down Sunset (Hollywood)
Been shopping all day (Beverly Hills), still ain't done yet (for real, for real)
Giuseppe, Chanel, coochie coochie Gucci nails (for real, for real)
I'ma love ya, understand it later
Give your heart to a heartbreaker (for real, for real)
Pick a destination, pack your Marc Jacobs, it's a vacay (for real, for real)
Call up Zaytoven (Zaytoven), in the 4x4 going crazy (skrr)

[Pre-Chorus]
With them Club bitches, them club bitches
Club bitches, them club bitches
Have fun with 'em, and what? Wanna run with 'em
They gon' raise our future, give love to them, show love
Club bitches, them club bitches
They just only want, what they got? Only got one wish (one wish)
Have fun with us, and what? Wanna run with us
We play in the jacuzzi, we bubblin' nigga (oh woah)

[Chorus]
With a quarter million cash in the bathtub (cash)
Champagne splash in the bathtub (splash)
I'm out in my new swag, NASA (NASA)
City on my back, need a back rub (oh woah)
Quarter million cash in the bathtub (cash)
Champagne splash in the bathtub (splash)
I'm out in my new swag, NASA (NASA)
City on my back, need a back rub (oh woah)

[Verse 2]
Gotta call my club bitch, them club bitches
We gon' hit the Bay, then what? Go dumb with it (go dumb)
When she in LA, she gon' dodge a nigga
Yeah, club bitches, MIA, let the sun hit 'em
Have fun with 'em, and what? Wanna run with 'em
They gon' raise our future, give love to them, show love
Club bitches, them club bitches
We play in the jacuzzi

[Outro]
Oh, woah
Cash splash NASA
Oh, woah
Cash splash NASA
Oh, woah
