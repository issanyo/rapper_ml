[Verse 1]

Shit popping off got me thinking like a kingpin
Niggas be free promo, yeah my name ringing
Power moves only like khaled, all I do is win
Been playin checkers why you niggas playing checkers
Bitch fell in love with my dick, she thinks its all hers
Juvi this thats gotti your bitch just google that
Niggas claim they chasing cheddar but be all rats
Niggas claim they shooters but never held gats
She calling me her Pharoah, stay near like the gamo
Fuck getting bussed, only cuffs be on the buckle
She knows I'm the man, run the city like lebron
Never fold, never told, nigga im a fuckin bon
Always keep a freak like nicki she wanna minaj
Got the keys to the city, nigga thats meek in philly
I been feeling like truman, these niggas actors
Got hella directors, they love shooting actors
Goofy try to rob my guys he getting fucking flatlined
Any nigga talking gun play will get flatlined
He tucking his hands or get tucked in a body bag
Hustling until I hand my fams that duffel bag
Haters try pull me down, I pay em no mind
I am the fucking future, bossin like a desiigner
She always on my lingo, shit its like I designed her
His bitch on the hit list, and I fuck her whenever
She tell she got a man but its really whatever
She went down to my waist, I tell the bitch go head
Intelligent bitches give a nigga dumb head
Never trusting bitches, they snaking like medusa
Keep burners in the room, it get real cold
Bitches asking for my gov, like some fucking jakes
Never with that cuffin shit, shits for the jakes
Rattin ass niggas so cheesy when they see cops
Fuck a bad bitch once and never hit her back
Money never did me dirty, been a down bitch
In love with the money she never stops coming
Everytime I'm in some pussy, your bitch can't stop coming
I bust on her lip now she's talking stick talk
Broke boy stay away from me, I don't wanna talk
