[Intro: Smoke Supreme]
Aye

[Chorus: Smoke Supreme]
I feel like the walking dead, I'm a zombie (I’m a zombie, aye)
If he try me I'mma have to catch a body (catch a body, aye)
I'mma put 18 shots up in his body (in his body, aye)
Bitch it’s Smoke Supreme, I don’t fuck with nobody (with nobody, bitch)
Once I stack this cheddar I'mma buy a Rarri (buy a Rarri, bitch)
That’s your bitch, she gon' ride me like a Harley (like a Harley, vroom)
Bitch my outfits cost a whole lotta money (lotta money bitch)
I can’t trust people cause they actin' funny (man, fuck em)

[Verse 1: Smoke Supreme]
Smoke Supreme I pull up with that choppa
Make them pistols sing like Phantom of the Opera
Rockin' Louis sandals, I don't wear no Prada
Bitch I'm gettin racks, now all I rock designer
It's me and 17, man we some walking zombies
He got that 30 on him, don't shoot up the party (boom boom boom)
Fuck a Honda Civic, all we ride is Rarris
I took his bitch from him, hell no I ain't sorry (hell nah)

[Chorus: Smoke Supreme]
I feel like the walking dead, I'm a zombie (I’m a zombie, aye)
If he try me I'mma have to catch a body (catch a body, aye)
I'mma put 18 shots up in his body (in his body, aye)
Bitch it’s Smoke Supreme, I don’t fuck with nobody (with nobody, bitch)
Once I stack this cheddar I'mma buy a Rarri (buy a Rarri, bitch)
That’s your bitch, she gon' ride me like a Harley (like a Harley, vroom)
Bitch my outfits cost a whole lotta money (lotta money bitch)
I can’t trust people cause they actin' funny (man, fuck em)

[Verse 2: KUJOSREVENGE]
Yeah yeah, I feel like a zombie (what)
Bitch you get your fits from Walmart, I got hearts all on my body  (hearts)
Do the dash in kawasaki, gettin money, fuck yo mommy
Pull up flexin' in a Rarri, Major Smoke we go retarded, ayy
Diamond shine, make you blind, I'm not sorry, ayy
Crunch time, smokin' woods like a safari, ayy (yeah)
Gotta shine, mighty fine, sippin' white wine (what)
Yeah I'm God to your bitch, my drip is so divine (gang gang)

[Chorus: Smoke Supreme]
I feel like the walking dead, I'm a zombie (I’m a zombie, aye)
If he try me I'mma have to catch a body (catch a body, aye)
I'mma put 18 shots up in his body (in his body, aye)
Bitch it’s Smoke Supreme, I don’t fuck with nobody (with nobody, bitch)
Once I stack this cheddar I'mma buy a Rarri (buy a Rarri, bitch)
That’s your bitch, she gon' ride me like a Harley (like a Harley, vroom)
