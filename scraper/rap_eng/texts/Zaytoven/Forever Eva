[Verse 1: Future]
I hit the lot with them racks on me
I went to court with that pack on me
I had that weed and that molly on me
I pour that lean by the gallon gallon
I got some rings and they mellow yellow
Put 25 bitches in Margiela
My heart in the ghetto, it's permanent
I'm stuck in the trenches, it's permanent
I swear I be hearing my grand daddy talk to me
Stack up the mils like some molly, yeah
Ride for these niggas who loyal
They gave me away, I'm a orphan
Middle finger to my daddy, yeah
I had to get inside that paddy wagon
Pop a few shots on 'em, yeah, yeah
I lay 'n' play up in Bora Bora
I splurge Chanel on the strip for Ya
I know the rage of them demons
I seen the doubt in they faces
Niggas ain't think I would make it
I did this shit, no limitation
Prosperity, no hesitation
I keep on moving that work, then I pull off in a spaceship

[Verse 2: Future]
I had some dirt on my shoulder, I wiped it off like I was Jigga, mane
That thrilla manilla, mane
I growed up with dealers, mane
I worked in the cold with that pole on me
And then I went straight to that bowl on me
That yoppa right there on the stove
Stuff all that guala in shoe boxes
These bitches be loving my caterings
I told her, "on top I'm an alien"
Survive the trenches with wolves
I got it and blew out the roof
Put two dollars in change on the coupe
Put change on your head and you're done
I get you hit up with drug money
Aggravated by the bullshit
Told you I ain't have a conscience
Fuck around and kill ya mama
In them Maison's, I find Ya like Jason
That's Maison Margiela, ya follow me?
I be everywhere a dollar be
I done made it out of poverty
I can see 'em when they doubted me
No, they should've never doubted me

[Hook: Future]

Hang out the brain forever, ever
Fuck all the fame forever, ever
