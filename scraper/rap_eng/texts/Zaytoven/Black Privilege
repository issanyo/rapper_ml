[Bridge: Trey Songz]
VVVV on my wrist, they hate to see me dippin' like this
They hate to see me livin' like this, all up on yo TV like this
Kissin' black queens on screens, that's a hot flex
Baby poppin' vicodins, I feel like a Viking
Spike Lee'll do the right thing, that's the swipe thing
But I got that cash flow and that's exciting
Niggas been about it, dick ridin'
Fuck a nigga sister, main girl and his side thing
I be in it till the cops come side me (fuck 12)
Bitches love me like Al Green, yeah

[Outro: Trey Songz]

We got money, what we finna talk 'bout?
We got money, what we finna talk 'bout?
We got money, what we finna talk 'bout?
