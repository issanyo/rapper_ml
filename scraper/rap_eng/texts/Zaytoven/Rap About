[Hook]
Nigga sit yo ass down
Man, what is you a class clown?
I'm smoking outta the pound right now
I'm on the mic right now like man
What the fuck I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
Man, what I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
Man, what I'm finna rap about?

[Verse 1]
The money, I'ma rap about that
I know niggas get the money and make it all stretch
The lavish lifestyle, I'm gone preach about that
Cause I done been up in the streets, I did it already
This bitch said she want some Tiffany's
I told her you want you a Christmas tree
Told that hoe, I'ma rap about that
She like, I know you ain't kidding with me
Me and my lil' niggas hot sauce
They give me something to rap about
They gon come trough, extended clip
They gon fuck a round, put the mop on
That bitch calling my phone
Told that bitch that I'm not home
Told that bitch, I'ma rap about that
I can't leave it alone
I come through S Apollo, you can get a hollow
I just hit the lotto, I'm Otto with the auto

[Hook]
Nigga sit yo ass down
Man, what is you a class clown?

I'm on the mic right now like man
What the fuck I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
Man, what I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
Man, what I'm finna rap about?

[Verse 2]
These bitches, I should rap about that
She tried to take my money, I should slap her bout that
She say these niggas dummies, I know nothing bout that
I come from the slums, bitch we rumble bout that
Back to rapping bout the money, you get crumble bout that
Rap you like a follow, you get tunneled bout that
I gave the bitch a hunnid, bitch be humble bout that
She like I know sugar daddies, I don't give a fuck about that
She like, so you real, and I love you bout that
You so damn crazy, I'm gon fuck you bout that
You ain't nothing like these clowns, I'ma suck you bout that
Nigga sit yo ass down, you ain't nothing like that

[Hook]
Nigga sit yo ass down

What the fuck I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
Man, what I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
Man, what I'm finna rap about?
