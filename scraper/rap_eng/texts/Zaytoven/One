[Intro]
Hey Zay
Young Jefe Holmes
Whoa

[Verse 1]
Remember back when all I used to do was hit licks
All a nigga really wanted was to get rich
Oh you ain't fucking with the gang?, then suck a full clip
Fuck what they talking bout, I'm really with that bullshit
Fresh Prince, I walk up in this bitch like Will Smith
Foreign Swag, I took your bitch out on a field trip
Glizzy Glizzy, bitch I'm back up on my hood shit
Look like a model, but lil' shawty she a hood bitch
She got a million dollar body and her ass soft
She call me over there, know it won't be the last call
You better not be no broke nigga, she going spazz off
I fuck with boss bitches, only like them cash dolls

[Hook]
I found this lil' bitch, think she the one
But I know I can't be the only one
Tell them niggas that they got the one
They treat you better when you number one
These bitches wanna fuck me because I'm arrogant
New watch on my wrist, look at the clarity
Put this chain around my neck so you can stare at it
Everything I do is so extravagant

[Verse 2]
As long as Im alive, bitch I gotta keep that felon on me
Niggas hated on me so I got to keep the pressure coming
Murder, murder, murder, if I ever see you or your mommy
How you hating on a young nigga getting money
Don't be telling on me
Don't be telling on me
Imma come and see you nigga, so be ready for me
And she going come back, she can't find a nigga better than me
Streets hotest younging, ain't another nigga litter than me

[Hook]
I found this lil' bitch think she the one
But I know I can't be the only one
Tell them niggas that they got the one
They treat you better when you number one
These bitches wanna fuck me cause I'm arrogant
New watch on my wrist, look at the clarity
Put this chain around my neck so you can stare at it
Everything I do is so extravagant
