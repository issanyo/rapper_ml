[Verse 1: Chicken Soup Phantom]
The Halfies, The Halfies, I stink just like them halfies
But nigga I can't stay away from the halfies
I can't stop, I can't get away from these halfies
Hide from Cathy, Cause naw, naw, She don't like them halfies
So you better stay away from Cathy, Don't look under the trailer that's my halfies
Shouts out to Rigo Figo, Shouts out to Jenn Franklin (Jenn Franklin)
Every Saturday night I give my monkey a spankin' (Spank my monkey)
That's my lighter motherfucker, or am I just bummin (Aye motherfucker)
Oh shit you better hide; cause Shaun is comin (Oh shit)
She found my joint, oh, I better get runnin (Damn)
Get suspended for walking out of class (Oooooh)
Oh goddamn, Dana's gonna whip my ass
