Front door, back door (x4)
Take what I want like it's nothing (x4)
Front door, back door (x4)
Take what I want like it's nothing (x4)

[Verse 1]
Walk in the front but I keep at the back
And I'm cuffing that back like it ain't never happen
I'm keeping the front man I take what I wanted
'Drenaline rush and don't feel repercussion
Got some niggas bout that drama, coming
?? babies and your mama, ??
Duck tape niggas just for flexing
I just hit the lick and bought a necklace
Told that nigga I got what he wanted
I told him to meet me at park around the corner
Just give me that check while and I pull right back on you
Before we look up I'll be gone with the homies
Countin' that check while I'm rollin' up laughin'
Asking for action, I let yo' ass have it
My bitch the baddest but she ‘bout that cabbage
You talking that money she might have you splash it
Lean with no fear when I move like a savage
Just hit the lick got a chick out in Paris
Mind on my money, don't get embarassed
Countin' them stacks, money my marriage
Lookin’ my chain like a hundred some carats
Make ?? finesse ?? the shit
?? I ain't hearing
Watch out the 40's they watch how I wear it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Front door, back door
I'm on trap mode
Pull up back row
Pull off saxual
Take what I want like it's nothing
Just hit the stage for a hundred
Just gotta play for the 50
He text me he told me he comin'
Luke got the ?? got the whoop
Got the remix I'm fresh on the come up
I'm runnin' from city to city
Finessin' the check told that bitch I'll be gone by the sun up
You got it, I want it I lean it
Told on that ?? call it heaven
Wifie take one outta town
My other one here for the evening
Make it place, pockets stuff
Gold chain, give a fuck
Got them shooters, got them hitters
Got them killers, in the truck
Shit I can get you to Molly's
Your bitch tryna come give me knowledge
I fuck her I dub her I leave her
And make that bitch pay for the parking
