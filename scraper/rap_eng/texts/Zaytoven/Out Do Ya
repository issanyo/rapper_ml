[Verse 1]
If I ain't a millionaire then my lil boy can grow a pussy
If Guwop ain't bout his business then Popeye must be a sissy
And if you ain't getting money I don't wanna talk to ya
Cause how you let a nigga in the feds out do you
I'm not politically correct cause bitch I ain't no politician
I can't hang round none of you niggas cause you niggas might be snitchin'
But I ain't gotta deal with you, nigga I don't eat with you
But how you bitches let these bogus ass niggas sleep with you?
I can't live with you, lay with you, take that pussy with you
I can't put up with you, play with you, ain't got free dick to give you
They tried to be cool with ya, chill with ya, take no pictures
What the fuck I look like standing by you police ass niggas

[Hook]
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
Your pockets in the red and I don't wanna talk to you
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?

[Verse 2]
I'm laughing to myself cause these rappers so broke
They sold no dope they donâ€™t want no smoke
How they let a nigga in the feds out do em
I ain't got no rap, I let my chopper talk to em
A nigga need me, I don't need no nigga
I'm the shooter and the boss, I don't need no killer
The money that he make don't make me richer
I'm the slickest nigga walkin' I don't need no feature
Sittin on the hood of my brand new Bentley
Old neighborhood with some brand new jewelry
Big diamond rings like a old school preacher
Bitch let a nigga out the feds come beat ya

[Hook]
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds?
(Damn)
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
Your pockets in the red and I don't wanna talk to you
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
