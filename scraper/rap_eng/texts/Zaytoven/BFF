[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Whole lot of money that my BFF
Keep a Glock .40 in my Fendi belt
Getting so much cash I don't need a wallet
You smoking on that trash, throw it in the garbage
Young street nigga coming from the pot
Hanging on the block, kickin' with the convict
They say that money talk so don't you make a comment
I'm proud of myself motherfucker I done it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Done it, done it, done it man I'm runnin' up
Tity Boi 'bout to fuck the summer up
Order some new things for the Wraith
3rd chain on to get her naked
I'ma poster child for the hustle
You a poser child for them bustas
Game up for grabs, I'ma take it
Try to stay down like the pavement
Live by the code, keep it true
Anything and everything to get a loot
Nigga think they trill but I'm triller
Nigga think they ill but I'm iller
Nigga think they big but I'm larger
Pussy you ain't nothin' but a target
Smokin' on joints, gettin' massages
Keep dodgin' me and I charge up

Whole lot of money that my BFF
Keep a Glock .40 in my Fendi belt
Getting so much cash I don't need a wallet
You smoking on that trash, throw it in the garbage
Young street nigga coming from the project
Hanging on the block, kickin' with the convict
They say that money talk so don't you make a comment
I'm proud of myself motherfucker I done it

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
In first class they ask me what I do
Had a stove, microwave and a blender too
Pull up on your set in a 62
Pull up on your set just to send em through
Shittin' on them niggas like an enema
Fuck the bitch, had to say I'm into her
Nigga know I know I been winnin'
Niggas I know I know I don't give any fucks
Sold my Monte Carlo, bought a Cadillac
Sold my Cadillac and went and got a Beamer
I used to put my drawls in the cleaners
Trap down the street from Phillips Arena
Spend a lil money you can't take it with ya
They said the feds out here takin' pictures
Well I'm the freshest nigga on their Instagram
Hashtag making bands, yes I am
