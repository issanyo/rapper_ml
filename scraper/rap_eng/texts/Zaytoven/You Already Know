[Intro]
Soulja
Sean, what up boy? Aye!
Y'all already know man, real niggas in the building
Young niggas gettin' to the money man
Time is money man
Stacks on deck, rich gang

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
[?]
Got it out the mall yeah we started in the field, boy
We do this shit for real
Don't fuck around, you know the deal, yeah
You already know (you already know, you already know)
You already know (you already know, you already know)
Oh yeah

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Foreign whips when we ride out
Bad bitch in my hide out
My hat low, my shades on, (Soulja) countin' this money
I'm a real nigga, that's my theme song
She got a nigga on the ring tone
We got high and fucked all night
Lean all up in my Sprite
She fuck with me cause I'm a real nigga
Polo and no Hilfigers
I be gettin' money but my bills bigger
She give me head over heels nigga
Got money all in my stills, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rich the Kid]
She already know I'm a young rich nigga
Diamonds get dressed, and the wrist it get changed
They knowing the name
I'd rather be rich, fuck the fame
Had to juug back then, cookin' bricks for a nigga
Made a million in the kitchen
But now they see me on TV
I pull up the Audi with Benjamins, get it
Meet up with keys and the Soulja
I'm whipping the yola, they think that my wrist has a motor
My mama she smelling the odor, I'm trapping the Georgia
I'm moving the coca, no cola
And my bitch got a crib out in Beverley
Feels good to be rich for a little sit
Too many karats on my neck, Bugs Bunny
I done came from the bottom, got money

[Hook]
