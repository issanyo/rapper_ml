[Intro: Future]
Super
You can feel the pain on a young nigga, you hear me?
Future Hendrix
Young rich nigga, fuckin' bad bitches
That's all I know (that's all I know)
It's sad to say that
Hendrix
This couldn't be love, man
This couldn't be love

[Chorus: Future]
Check out the way I be glistenin', yah
Four-door Bugatti, you mention me, yah
Diamonds they drapped in my portfoli-yah
Fill up a safe, I'm more realer than y'all
Fuck my new case, I'm more realer than y'all
Ace by the case, I'm more realer than y'all
Sleep with the 'K, I'm more realer than y'all
A regular day, I'm more chiller than y'all
Diamonds on freeze, ain't gon never thaw out
Niggas talk shit, ain't gon never be found
Countin' it up and I'm losin' the count
Fuck all this 'Tussin, this Act' I'ma down
Strappin' it up with a whole hundred rounds
Sackin' it up, ain't no fuckin' around
We get that guap, ain't no fuckin' around

[Verse 1: Future]
Ice overload, this ain't regular ice
Hop on a private, ain't regular flights
Smash on your hoe, this is everyday life
I filled the safe up from cookin' the white
Fall out the pyrex, the cake and the bowl
Used to the fame, ya'll ain't taking my soul
Came in the game, I was hot as a stove
Pour out some lean, I'm trynna let it go
Rockin' Celine from her head to her toe
Fur on her back, in the summer she cold
VVs gon' light up and glisten, they glow
Blinding your eyesight, you never gon' see
Came out the 6, damn, my diamonds on fleek
I made a mil' in the middle of the week
I sell a chicken in the middle of the street
When I drop a tape the murder rate increase
Fuck all that poppin,' I stay with some bands
Shawty so yellow, she stay with a tan
Diamonds on me, got some rocks on my hand
Fuck the police, gotta stay with the can
I drop the top off a regular Wraith
Shawty on Perc, this a drug addict date
I got the torch, I can't give it away
Ain't no remorse, you get hit in the face

[Chorus: Future]
Check out the way I be glistenin', yah
Four-door Bugatti, you mention me, yah
Diamonds they drapped in my portfoli-yah
Fill up a safe, I'm more realer than y'all
Fuck my new case, I'm more realer than y'all
Ace by the case, I'm more realer than y'all
Sleep with the 'K, I'm more realer than y'all
A regular day, I'm more chiller than y'all
Diamonds on freeze, ain't gon never thaw out
Niggas talk shit, ain't gon never be found
Countin' it up and I'm losin' the count
Fuck all this 'Tussin, this Act' I'ma down
Strappin' it up with a whole hundred rounds
Sackin' it up, ain't no fuckin' around
We get that guap, ain't no fuckin' around

[Verse 2: Future]
Four-door Bugatti, you mention a G
Brand new Millennium, might hit the streets
I stacked it up, get to havin' a feast
I racked it up like Serena with me
Like it's Venus with me, got the Nina with me
We screaming 'Freebandz,' this money ain't free
I cook it up, I'ma cook up a key
When I cook up a key, I'ma charge you a fee
I did it first, it ain't none but a trend
Swerve on a curb, it ain't none but a Benz
I was on 2 then I took it to 10
Keep in one thou, rep the gang in the pen'
Shoot at the police, ain't comin' back home
Down for my crew if they right or they're wrong
Get to that money, that's all I condone
Shoot at your top, you ain't fuckin' with homes
We hit the block, had a bag full of stones
Jugged off a bale before I made a song
They ain't gon' tell you how I got it on
I'm not a failure, I'm deep in my zone
Paraphernalia, I serve you a crumb
Super exclusive when I put it on
We gettin' zooted where I'm comin' from
Toastin' that lean like it's Dom Perignon

[Chorus: Future]
Check out the way I be glistenin', yah
Four-door Bugatti, you mention me, yah
Diamonds they drapped in my portfoli-yah
Fill up a safe, I'm more realer than y'all
Fuck my new case, I'm more realer than y'all
Ace by the case, I'm more realer than y'all
Sleep with the 'K, I'm more realer than y'all
A regular day, I'm more chiller than y'all
Diamonds on freeze, ain't gon never throw out
Niggas talk shit, ain't gon never be found
Countin' it up and I'm losin' the count
Fuck all this 'Tussin, this Act' I'ma down
Strappin' it up with a whole hundred rounds
Sackin' it up, ain't no fuckin' around
We get that guap, ain't no fuckin' around

[Outro: Future]
(Yeah) Young rich nigga, fuckin' bad bitches
That's all I know (that's all I know)
It's sad to say that
