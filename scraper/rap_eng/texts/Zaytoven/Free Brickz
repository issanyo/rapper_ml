[Verse 2: Future]
My chuck taylors got spikes on top
Got a polo horse on the side of my sock
Them whole thangs go for 30 a whop
Got purple lean inside my pop
My black shades, I'm rock starred out
I turned the block into a drop
Free bricks 3x
Ima zone six nigga hittin licks
I got dope inside my piss
I got ice on side my wrist
I got ice on top of my hands
And I stay screaming free Bands
I got all these damn white bitches
Lookin' like the Ku Klux Klan
And I can't wait to kill they mouth
Ima young nigga comin out the south Heyyyy
