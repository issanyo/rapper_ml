[Verse 1: Yung Gleesh]
I got a hundred grand shawty, and just the other day
I was broke in the traphouse, couldn't spend a hundred K
I got work in the boot tho, I can send it right your way
I got 10-30 swans at my front door everyday

[Verse 2: Ballout]
Did the swans knock your door
Damn, swans call my phone
They just won't leave me lone
I can serve em at they home
Know I'm still getting them bricks from Mexico, just call my phone
Back then they didn't want a nigga, now they all on me

[Verse 3: Capo]
Baby girl look we the Glo, I smoke about 3 zips a day

But every thing you don't got I got everything you wanted

[Verse 5: Ballout]
