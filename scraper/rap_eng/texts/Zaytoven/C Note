C notes

Shorty gonna pop that pussy for them c notes
Bet she gonna fcuk me for a c note
But Elly only in love wit them c notes
Yo nigga ain't on shit see I'm bout them c notes
I can't be talkin if it ain't bouta cnote
I told c3 to change his name to c note
Cuz all the niggas round me bout them c notes
I like my cheese blue just like a c note

I ain't flexxin I put on for my people
SMG call us the black beetles

Shorty gonna pop that pussy for them c notes
Bet she gonna fcuk me for a c note
But Elly only in love wit them c notes
Yo nigga ain't on shit see I'm bout them c notes
I can't be talkin if it ain't bouta cnote
I told c3 to change his name to c note
Cuz all the niggas round me bout them c notes

C Notes for the whip
Took a trip should've bought a bitch
Should've told my man chill but I didn't took an L bought a brick
Need a scale for the shit haters we gone give em hell for the shit
Pray he fail but he lit peep the watch prolly tell that he rich
I can tell you a vick MOB i prolly sell you a bitch
I can tell you a snitch prolly ask if I can sell you a brick?
Fuck is wrong with these chumps and the chopper get along with the pump
Hear the horn when he slumped trap Ima get it gone in a month
Get it gone in a day and the rolly boogers all in the face
Bitches all in his face got it I can hit the mall everyday
Whats the cost heavy pay bitches had em all everyway
Had to ball everyday panamera had ball every play
Shoutout to my nigga Elz we ain't took a loss yet you a boss yet?
30 thousand when I crossed stepped it was plain jane had to frost that
Fly shit I never lost that I dont deal with workers where your boss at
100 grand all C notes in the whip fill it up with weed smoke

Shorty gonna pop that pussy for them c notes
