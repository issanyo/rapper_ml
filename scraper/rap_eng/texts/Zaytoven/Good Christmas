[Intro]
Zaytoven
Oh, whoa
Feel real good
Good (Good), good (Good), good (Good), good (Good)
Good (Good), good (Good), good (Good), good (Good)

[Chorus]
Mama in the kitchen bakin' sweet potato pie
Daddy on the ladder puttin’ them last minute lights
Both sides of the family know what time to come on by
For some good, good, good, good Christmas
Have the game playin' loud on each and every TV
Have some last minute gifts still left to put up under the tree
And my baby's got undressed so she says it’s just for me
What a mmh, mmh, mmh, good Christmas
Good Christmas (Feel like it's gonna be a good)
Good Christmas (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I believe family should
Always be the centerpiece of good
Never be enemies, was mama's plea
Honesty, integrity, for good
A family that prays together
Will never break down, they will stand forever
Just let these tidings of joy get down in your soul
Heal you better and better

[Chorus]
Mama in the kitchen bakin' sweet potato pie
Daddy on the ladder puttin' them last minute lights
Both sides of the family know what time to come on by
For some good, good, good, good Christmas
Have the game playin' loud on each and every TV
Have some last minute gifts still left to put up under the tree
And my baby's got undressed so she says it's just for me
What a mmh, mmh, mmh, good Christmas
Good Christmas (It’s gonna be, it’s gonna be a)
Good Christmas (Hey)

[Verse 2]
We got good times, good vibes, good people (Singin')
We got good friends, good food, the kids playin’
Good times, no crime, hear what I'm sayin'?
The joy bell ringin' all over this land
Good Christmas
Good Christmas (It’s gonna be, gonna be, a good Christmas)

[Chorus]
Mama in the kitchen bakin' sweet potato pie
Daddy on the ladder puttin' them last minute lights
Both sides of the family know what time to come on by
For some good, good, good, good Christmas
Have the game playin' loud on each and every TV
Have some last minute gifts still left to put up under the tree
And my baby's got undressed so she says it's just for me
What a mmh, mmh, mmh, good Christmas
Good Christmas
Good Christmas

[Outro: Zaytoven & Deitrick Haddon]
Merry Christmas, everybody
From Zaytoven and the 'Tovens
Merry Christmas, everybody
Merry Christmas from the Haddons
Merry Christmas, everybody
Okay, we gotta say what we say
One more time
Y'all gotta be on one accord
