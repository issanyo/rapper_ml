Say ya wanna live like a no sleep gang member
Say you wanna live Like a no sleep gang member? (What ya wanna do?)
Say ya wanna live like a no sleep gang member
Like a no sleep gang member? (Say ya wanna be?)
Say ya wanna roll a three five in a Backwood
Or a Swisher? (Gas!)
Say ya wanna have shooter wit ya when ya trap
You ain't even got a pistol
Say ya wanna
Boy I know ya wanna
Nigga you a bitch don't ya wanna
Bustin' up the pussy like a condom
Bullets coming fast like a Zonda
Bullets coming hotter than a sauna
We stay with the toys like Tonka
Different color diamond Willy Wonka...
Never talk to your honor
I plead the fifth, i'm ese' for the summer
Ran up my sack i'm addicted to commas
Only get sleep on the lean in a coma
Walk in the store and go talk to the owner
Trap on the block the bando on the corner
Heavy artillery like i'm Osama
OG, good gas, you can smell the aroma
President tint like i'm riding with Obama

President tint like i'm riding with Obama
Where is Michelle?
Takeover your city
??? (Outer space man, Gone)
Got 50 bricks in a V12
On the block serving them bales
Ducking and dodging i'm running from 12
Jkeem ain't taking no L's
Cause I keep the steel
Nigga trying to bite me Holyfield
100 round drum overkill
Think i'm the NAVY the way I be popping seals
What ya wanna do?
What ya wanna be when ya grow up?
50 shooters when I pull up
Hunnid' hoes on my tour bus
Damn, who the hell is he?
Extendos and choppers whenever we pull up
Gold on me like slick tha ruler
Shout out to my jeweler
Iced out my Franck Muller
Iced out my Franck Muller
My neck is a cooler
My diamonds albino
I'm countin' the riches no Lionel
I'm smoking a pound of that OG
I'm reading the Bible
I'm playing with the rifle
I think i'm a sniper
2 twin choppers like the towers
For this stuffed crust
You gone need bout three lighters
Pocket full of Jackson
Where is Michael?
When you walk in my trap,you see dirty diapers
All I ever wanted was a sack
Every nigga in my gang kept a stack
Fuck up a check
I'm a get it right back
Whether I kick me a door
Or get it back in the TRAP!
I remember niggas sending shots subliminal
Tweeting on twitter so it got political
If I ever see ya it's gone get physical
Texas Lone Ranger danger
No Mystikal
Christian my Louboutins
Giuseppe steppers
I might just go
Maison Margiellas
Like i'm Roc-a-fella
Fly like a propeller
My diamonds they can shine in any weather
Boxing rings on my knuckles Mayweather
Yes this is real fox fur fuck nigga
Covering my mink chinchilla
What do you wanna be when you grow up?
What did you wanna do when you got up?
I hit da lot, cop a audi
When to the kitchen grabbed the spatula
That stick is magical
Beating babies with the pots and pans
Shit is tragical
I'm the ambassador
Pull up in a Lamborghini
It's a Aventador
Independent nigga, riding wit a hunnid' mill
I can get a life sentence
Block hot, 12 on a nigga
Cause they heard I juug'd about a hunnid pigeons
Red on the bottom my Louboutins
At the court side like i'm Jack Nicholson
Still got the pocket rocket
Neva catch me slipping
Master P i'm bout



The bigger the risk the bigger the reward
50 chickens on the highway
Its going to be a hundred more
I just touchdown on the plug I just scored
Hunnid' round in the chopper (Oh Lord)
Connected to the streets without a cord
50 hunnid' bricks up on a boat all aboard
My patna' Givenchy Balenciaga
Coming through ya winter call me Roger
It ain't bout' a dollar then why bother? (huh)
That gold on yo' neck look like copper
You snitching? You must be a crime stopper
I'm selling that white girl call it Mary Poppins
I'm pitching the work like a quarter back option
Double cup filled to the top, pure toxin
I am a leader niggas follow suit
When I go to the church, diamonds on me no suit
This is a family, not just a group
My nigga stick together, we win or we lose
Beatin' the pot and I gave it a bruise
These bitches they ain't shit
They fuck you and your crew
Stomp on you niggas like I am a Q
OG gas bag, it's smelling like puke
The devil fucking wit me he get rebuked
50 floors up nigga what a great view
I just beat the case, cause my lawyer a Jew
I'm sipping on actavis, good on the brew
What a miracle i'm living superior
Niggas can't fuck wit' us period
Niggas be hating saying that we not lyrical
Stand on the stove and i'm whipping the chemical
Finessing the plug and i'm acting delirious
Jumped off the porch cause a nigga was curious
You live and you learn off experience
Nigga do better
Nigga get some benjamins
You ballin' yo fist up, my nigga just listen...
Me and the pot got a very good chemistry
Used to fail chemistry
Now I pull up in a Bentley
Now these niggas they gone envy me


Outro: yea man GD FOLK....
NO SLEEP GANG SHIT...
