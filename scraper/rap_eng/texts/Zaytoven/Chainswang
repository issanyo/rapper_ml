Head, bangin'

[Chorus]

Chainswang, chainswang
Nigga chainswang
Chainswang. free my nigga out that chain gang
Chainswang, bling bling nigga bling bling
Chainswang, chainswang nigga chainswang

[Verse 1]

I'm drinkin' lean, that PRO, that methazine
I'm a pro, she on my team, know what I mean
Shit like Chris, that VVS, Wayerboyz my ring
And the Phone, put diamonds on, hotline bling
I attack, hop on the back, Kawasaki jack
It's all black, like we da' Klan, but it ain't that
It's the best, the well dressed, goonin' on the 'test
Still play, wit' yo drank, gatorade bitch
I brought some hoes to my house and before we got to m√©nag'in
I had to be a good host but bitch I went Miley Cyrus
What's good, they flockin' (?) screwdriver
I might just build her a casa, seen all that wood in her mouth
(sure, sure, sure)

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

And all a young nigga ever wanted was the chain
And all these old bitches want me back for the fame
And nigga I degrade her and she'll think it's okay
Cause she wanna be famous and fuck me off my name
And I shot the club up, on a Tuesday nigga
Got people in my life tryna' use me nigga
I used to put all my trust in you bae, remember?
Now I make a Starscream, fuck her off the transformer, bitch

[Hook]

[Chorus]
