[Intro]
Yeah, see
I'm the motherfucker that had your back
I was there before all this other shit came
Before all the houses and the cars
Before all the bitches and the broads
Before all shootin' for the stars I was there
I'm just tryin' to understand
What made you shit on me like that
And all motherfuckin' people, nigga
That's me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fuck ya!

[Hook]
Dedicated to the nigga who broke my heart (fuck ya!)
She the reason we fell apart
But now it's killa (for this bitch)
Killa (for this bitch)
Killa (for this bitch)
You gon' miss this bitch

[Verse 1]
See, I'm the type of bitch
I know how to do it all
You fuck these hoes
But when she get real I'm the one you call
I wasn't gettin' subpoena
I'm the one in court
And I don't mind
When you was ballin' I was on the court
Fruiticana in Winter
Top-down in December
How much money?
We spendin' them all, I don't remember
Your boys all call me
'Cause ain't no one can calm your temper
Pickin' out which car to drive
Was my only dillema
And with that [?] bitches
And with that comin' snitches
And with that calculin' everything
[?] from the beginning
I got a phone call
Knowin' some bullshit
She said the name was Bridget
I'm like "bitch, who's this?"

[Hook]
Dedicated to the nigga who broke my heart (fuck ya!)
She the reason we fell apart
But now it's killa (for this bitch)

[Verse 2]
See, I had them figure it out
Niggas, they ain't shit
While you lyin' in the bed cryin'
He with the next bitch
