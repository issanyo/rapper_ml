[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
If I pick you up, where you wanna go, tell me
Anywhere you want, I can take you there, let me
Show you 'round my way, baby I'm the man, if they
Tell you it's a lie, tell 'em take the stand, baby
Anywhere you want, baby we can go, let's go
Tell me what you roll, baby we can blow, let's smoke
He say he get dough but we know we don't, his cash low
Might be who I want if you can catch them all baby

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Figure she a trap queen, I let her count the money
She gonna hold me down, so I trust her with the homies
Military, got it, bitch I keep that fallen army
Plug talk Tony, I try every homie
Lamborghini Door, lately with the Rolls, well, well
I got all the J's 'fore they hit the streets
Bitches fall in love, I fall out of love, quickly
Nigga wanna hate, why they wanna hate, mischief

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
If I pick you up, where you wanna go, tell me
Anywhere you want, I can take you there, let me
Show you 'round my way, baby I'm the man, if they
Tell you it's a lie, tell 'em take the stand, baby
Anywhere you want, baby we can go, let's go
Tell me what you roll, baby we can blow, let's smoke
He say he get dough but we know we don't, his cash low
Might be who I want if you can catch 'em all baby

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I give you the world when you wanna go tell me
Screaming fuck the judge, I'd never sneak jail me
I got pounds of loud, when I'm walkin', you can smell me
Do it for the hood so it ain't nothing they could tell me
.40 on my hip, please don't let my .40 fail me
My girl she a trip, she be screaming out "Chanel me"
My girl she a gangster, only fuck with gangsters
We got something in common, we both keep them bangers

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
If I pick you up, where you wanna go, tell me
Anywhere you want, I can take you there, let me
Show you 'round my way, baby I'm the man, if they
Tell you it's a lie, tell 'em take the stand, baby
Anywhere you want, baby we can go, let's go
Tell me what you roll, baby we can blow, let's smoke
He say he get dough but we know we don't, his cash low
Might be who I want if you can catch 'em all baby

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
If I pick you up, where you wanna go, tell me
Anywhere you want, I can take you there, let me
Show you 'round my way, baby I'm the man, if they
Tell you it's a lie, tell 'em take the stand, baby
Anywhere you want, baby we can go, let's go
Tell me what you roll, baby we can blow, let's smoke
He say he get dough but we know we don't, his cash low
Might be who I want if you can catch 'em all baby
