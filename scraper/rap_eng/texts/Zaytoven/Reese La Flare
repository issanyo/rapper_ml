[Verse 1]
Im used to bein around them corner's blvd n edgewood
I skate to texico to get some swishas for the good
I was trappin like a fool and i went to school

That was 2006, when i was back on bullshit
Got the trasher hoodies with the vans

Now my diamonds macorena n my check jumped out the gym
And my life is like a movie with these model's made of film
Im a dog, im a dog
