[Hook: Young Dolph and Peewee Longway]
Heard that nigga snitching couldn't believe it
Everything happens for a reason
Too much of gold dough
I quit fucking with 'em
I don't know why I just felt like I couldn't trust that nigga
Met her at the beach
Took her to the Four Seasons
Fucked her, then I bought the girl a bag for no reason
I couldn't believe it
Come to find out her brother was the plug
So everything happens for a reason

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Met her at the beach
Took her back to the telly
[?] bitch,reminds me of [?]
She said "hold on nigga
I feel you all up in my belly"
I do my dirt [?]
Don't need no motherfucking celly
In other words I'm doing dirty work
I bought the bitch a purse just to see what she really were
Come to find out her big brother got the work
I struck gold, found the new plug
And went and got a spark
A week later now the whole South Memphis hot
New choppers and they all hold a hundred shots
Play with me I tell [?] to a haunted house
I heard you snitching [?] how the fuck you get out

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Her brother was the plug
I'm the motherfucking socket
You [?] that lil' nigga
To keep that pistol ready to pop' it (It's Dolph)
You never had a plug boy, stop it
My traphouse rockin'
My lil' nigga robbin'
I don't [?] and I don't [?]
Death to all snitches
We still mobbin'
Rap money, trap money
I'mma eat regardless
The neighborhood bought the rocks and the watches flawless
Everything happens for a reason
Nigga you tellin' it ain't no secret
I run gangs, so there [?] shit for me to peep in
I get rid of the weakest link
And you're the weakest
