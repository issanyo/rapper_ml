[Hook]
Fuck the bitch she doin' right
Bad boy, rude boy
Heavy money in my pants, boy your money too light
One plus one equals two, yeah you're right
Bitches come through and fuck me like its It’s two of I
Keep it cool boy, you boy, one boy, 2 boy
100 thousand dollar car, I can get 2 for it
Pull up onside of you laughing Ima jerk new boys
I fuck with all the old school rappers, I'm a new school boy

[Verse 1]
I'm smoking dope, you smoking on the fool boy
I'm riding foreign, rims look like 4 lil boys
I’m smoking Os, I smoke out the Ps too boy
I’m sweating like i got a fever, jewelry be the flu boy
You should know, we don't fuck with new boys
I treat these niggas like the bottom of my shoes boy
I want a boat but I bought a coupe boy
And bought a 4, so when I get tired of 2 boy
I switch it over, hop up in my 4 door
I’m going dumb, more money i get bored more
Since I'm the captain of the ship, I tell your ho to board
Ay bitch I'm the score, you better not be boring

[Hook]
Fuck the bitch she doin' right
Bad boy, rude boy
Heavy money in my pants, boy your money too light
One plus one equals two, yeah you're right
Bitches come through and fuck me like its It’s two of I
Keep it cool boy, you boy, one boy, 2 boy
100 thousand dollar car, I can get 2 for it
Pull up inside of your level, I'm a jerk, new boy
I fuck with all the old school rappers, I'm a new school boy

[Verse 2]
She better top me right, she just got off 2 flights tonight
She want the pipe, but I heard that cool bite, I'm cool Ike
What you worryin' bout, Nike just do it right

Remember having fight nights now I'm having food nights

No need for no mansion fights cause i got my own, aight?
