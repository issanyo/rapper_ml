[Hook]
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Fuck the feds, fuck the police, fuck the DA (DA)
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Ex-drug dealer, used to sell a brick a day
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Recovering drug addict, I used to drink a pint a day
(pint a day)
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Recovering drug addict, I used to smoke a pound a day (pound a day)

[Interlude]
It's Gucci
No sleep
Burr burrr burrr
I'm outchea
Zwizzop

[Verse]
When the sun comes out it takes the rain away
But just like Noah it been rainin' the last 40 days
Takin' pain pills, tryna take the pain away
Sold my first 8-ball and bought me my first pair of J's
Momma cussing out these disrespectful ass J's
They knockin' on the door, know I'm just in the 7th grade
I'm mixin' codeine pills and molly in a lemonade
I feel like Price, get so damn high, might just die any day (purple)
For all you junkies that's addicted, please don't get offended
I'm a recovering drug addict and that's not my intention
That OG gas hit my mailbox like a magazine subscription
My doctor in the feds for writing bad prescriptions
I got so drunk I left Priv√© and I crashed a Bentley
I'm a mathematician
I'm too stoned to miss it
I got the best intentions but I made rash decisions
Throwin' cash at bitches
Spend like half a chicken
Before I started rapping I was worth half a ticket
Took your stash to get it
Or spent it so fast it's silly
I drop the top on my Rolls Royce, I ride past the prison
They hate with a passion, I guess that's the new fashion, is it

[Hook]
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Fuck the feds, fuck the police, fuck the DA (DA)
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Ex-drug dealer, used to sell a brick a day (brick a day)
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Recovering drug addict, I used to drink a pint a day

Recovering drug addict, I used to smoke a pound a day (pound a day)


Fuck the feds, fuck the police, fuck the DA (DA)
I can't even sleep, I can't even sleep, I can't even sleep
