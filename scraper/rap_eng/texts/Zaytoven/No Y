[Hook]
You hate when you see me and I think I know why
You wish you could be me and I know I know why
Sold everything from A to Z, a G’ll know why
You hate when you see me and I think I know why
You hate when you see me and I think I know why
You wish you could be me and I know I know why
Sold everything from A to Z, a G’ll know why
You hate when you see me and I think I know why

[Verse 1]
I’m always on my A game, B I know you see why
Given women D on EN, I just F up their spot
A G plot on H bags, I need Js in my spot
Keep Ks and can’t take Ls, we need new Ms like right now
And Os and Ps and do that, I'ma cue you in how
I just want an R type and S class, that’s them drops
It’s two times, you wouldn’t understand till Vs on your chart
It’s Ws on my treasure map cause X marks the spot
Yeah yeah

[Hook]
You hate when you see me and I think I know why
You wish you could be me and I know I know why
Sold everything from A to Z, a G’ll know why
You hate when you see me and I think I know why
You hate when you see me and I think I know why
You wish you could be me and I know I know why
Sold everything from A to Z, a G’ll know why
You hate when you see me and I think I know why
