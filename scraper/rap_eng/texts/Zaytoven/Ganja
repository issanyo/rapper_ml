[Intro]
I told that bitch she ain't coming with me man
She gotta...bitch she ain't sitting around me for more than 3, 4 hours man bitch gotta get away from me ASAP, man you know, Rocky man

[Hook]
I told a bitch she ain't coming with us
She know I got this money with us
She know ain't nothing between us
She won't know shit 'till the Ganja pulled up
Until the Ganja pulled up
Ganja pulled up
Until the Ganja pulled up
Ganja pulled up
Until the Ganja pulled up
Ganja pulled up
Until the Ganja pulled up
Ganja pulled up

[Verse 1]
She see the weed and start to geek
It's a honor to sit by me
Say her boyfriend stopping in the club
I done told her to sit by me
It's a honor to get kicked by me
Honor to get touched by me
Smoke greener than a Christmas tree
She's honored to get fucked by me
Hopped in the whip and she like, "What about me?"
I told the bitch don't worry about me
She said she wanna just love on me
I told the bitch don't care about me
Hate these fuck niggas sneak dissing on me
You ain't my partner fuck your Howdy
Riding in the M6, pull up and fuck your Audi
These bitches be hissing like some lizards
These cats want to bite me I'm no Stuart Little
If I ain't have this cash I'd be miserable
Sosa Wayne bitch I lost my ceilings too

[Hook]
I told a bitch she ain't coming with us
She know I got this money with us
She know ain't nothing between us
She won't know shit 'till the Ganja pulled up
Until the Ganja pulled up
Ganja pulled up
Until the Ganja pulled up
Ganja pulled up
Until the Ganja pulled up
Ganja pulled up
Until the Ganja pulled up
Ganja pulled up

[Verse 2]
I'm smoking dough you smoking the ew
E-40 I'm sipping mud
Pimp C in my pimp cup DJ Screw me up
If you getting money lift your money up
Shooter lift your toolie up
If I see a watch nigga put it, Fake Watch Busta can't put you up
This dope smoke like I'm cooking it
I done put my foot in it
I gotta get the car, 'cuz I put my head in it
If I put my head in it that mean it's a gotta get
I know what jail like, I don't want no sandwiches
I hop on then demolish it
My shoes have 'em polish
My car have 'em wax it, I get that $1,000 shit
I talk it 'cuz I'm walkin' it
My bitch Lara Crofting it
The [?] so damn conceited he like you walkin' bitch

[Hook]
I told a bitch she ain't coming with us
She know I got this money with us
She know ain't nothing between us
She won't know shit 'till the Ganja pulled up
Until the Ganja pulled up
Ganja pulled up
Until the Ganja pulled up
Ganja pulled up
Until the Ganja pulled up
Ganja pulled up
Until the Ganja pulled up
Ganja pulled up
