I am Mr Ballistic
Balling these statistics
Dat Lonzo life i’ll risk it
For a rollie on my wrist lit
I'm dat brick-speare cause i push weight with my words
Rap’s willy shakes, boy, im moving like skrrrrrr
Skrit with the verbiage, boy, my verses berserk
Damn i'm so humble, might lend kendrick some work
Nothing but net when i'm on my dirk
Speakers snap so the young ones turnt
Going in for the cash, don’t care who i hurt
I'mma lyrical luger, Big Uzi Vert
Costanza i can't stand ya, listen up you know
Ann Landers give advice you take my candor
Otherwise I'm breathing Gandora
Watch me Overwhelm your ramparts
And I tear at you with rancor
I'm Big ballin with the bangers
Racks on racks on racks like bankers
Teacher, rapper, sanger, aye
Get lit by my fingers, aye
Big white like i'm da zinger, aye
So don't spit back in anger, aye
BRITspeare to zaytoven aye
Im da future, chosen aye
Bet BET, they knows it, aye?
Ok!
