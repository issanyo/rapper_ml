(Chorus)
Tired of sneaking around (8x)

(Verse 1)
Tired of sneaking out your house (Tired of sneaking out your house)
You gon' keep me around (You gon' keep me around)
Cuz I put it down (You know I put it down, you know I put it down)
You should appreciate what you found
Would you still like me if you dumped him right now?
Would you do the same thing if I went out of town?
You could be royalty, you could get your own crown
But you don't show loyalty, so how does that sound?

(Chorus)
Tired of sneaking around (8x)

(Verse 2)
Tired of peeking over my shoulder, cuz I know his face, but I don't know him
That's a pretty big explanation that you owe him
Pressure like that makes a man crack like Odom
Especially when I hit it from the back, I own it
Don't no man wanna go out like that
If he ever find out he won't bounce right back
You said that he Reggie and my love loud pack
We sexin' then she exit then she texts me in an hour flat

(Chorus)
Tired of sneaking around (8x)
