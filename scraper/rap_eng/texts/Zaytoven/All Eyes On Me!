[Verse 1]
Puerto Rican rockstar got your nigga lookin'
Whole brick, half a brick, whip that, watch me cookin'
Tu en mi, no me conoces
I'm bossin', your baby's givin' me Gucci
Me cago en tu madre, kill them with verses
Back to back, black on black Bentleys like we in hearses
Catchin' plays like I'm Julio, Rolly goin' stupido
All this ass got your main nigga like a groupie hoe
I said "All this ass got your main nigga like a groupie hoe"

[Hook]
All eyes on me
