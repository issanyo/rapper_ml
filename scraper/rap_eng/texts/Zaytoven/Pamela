[Hook: Quavo]
I just took your hoe cause I ain't got no manners
Riding round Atlanta and I'm trapping out a Phantom
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga cooking up Pamela
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga whipping up Pamela (Ay!)
I just took your hoe 'cause I ain't got no manners
Riding round Atlanta and I'm trapping out a Phantom
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga cooking up Pamela
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga whipping up Pamela (Ay!)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
My money growing like a chia pet
Young nigga still trapping off the metro and Nokia
Play with the dough, pizzeria
Takeoff just bought twenty seals
My nigga trapping and camping
We taking the plug off and land in Korea
I'm a OG in the hood they calling me Wizard Quavo Bradley Beal
I've been pushing off the back with no smell
Way before the vacuum seal
Niggas used to having bricks in the bell
Most of you niggas gone tell
Everything that I touch I can sell
I done sold water to a fish and a whale

[Hook]
I just took your hoe 'cause I ain't got no manners
Riding round Atlanta and I'm trapping out a Phantom
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga cooking up Pamela
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga whipping up Pamela (Ay!)
I just took your hoe 'cause I ain't got no manners
Riding round Atlanta and I'm trapping out a Phantom
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga cooking up Pamela
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga whipping up Pamela (Ay!)

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Pamela, Pamela, my arm got stamina
Eat that dab up like a cannibal
July 31st better mark that your calendar
Drinking Act' double cup looking like lavender
Smoking on cookies, good medical cannabis
Black diamond medallion don't call up the ambulance
Kim K Christian Louboutins Pamela Anderson
I got that steel on me still like a mannequin
Once you go come place your order
Then come cross the border
Pamela important
Never extorted
My niggas important
I'm Takeoff Obama 'cause I get escorted
24 carat can't shit on my toilet
Don't hit my phone if you know you can't afford it
What I pour in a twenty I show mortgage
And my pinky ring is looking like a orbit

[Hook]
I just took your hoe 'cause I ain't got no manners
Riding round Atlanta and I'm trapping out a Phantom
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga cooking up Pamela
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga whipping up Pamela (Ay!)
I just took your hoe 'cause I ain't got no manners
Riding round Atlanta and I'm trapping out a Phantom
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga cooking up Pamela
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela (Anderson)
Young nigga whipping up Pamela (Ay!)
