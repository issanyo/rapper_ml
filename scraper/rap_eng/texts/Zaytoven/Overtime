[Intro]
Boz (ouuui), Choppa Gang
S/o to Zay, 1017

[Chorus]
Bout my bidness all the time
Chasin' money all the time
Hittin' licks like all the time
It's time to grind like overtime
All the time, all the time, all the time I overtime(x2)

[Verse 1]
Find me in the trap like 24 a day
Feelin' like a masterchef from cooking all this yey
Just a pinch of soda they call me Baking Bay
I never cut too much, I'm sellin' all my products straight
Ion need to fake it, I'm too real to fake success
Money in the bag, need to clean this money fast
Money in the launder when I smoke it on this gas
Always wake&bake it never smoking on that stress
Got my own teller, I'm on that level
Ask me who I'm banking with, I'm banking with the Devil
Got my own label, I'm on that level
Ask me who I'm banking with, I'm banking with the Devil

[Verse 2]
Got no time to lose, so don't me waste it on my time
You ain't talkin' money don't be callin on my line
Mom ain't got the money, I've got focused on my grind
This is why I'm talkin' money almost all the time

[Chorus](x2)
Bout my bidness all the time
Chasin' money all the time
Hittin licks like all the time
It's time to grind like overtime
All the time, all the time, all the time I overtime[x2]
