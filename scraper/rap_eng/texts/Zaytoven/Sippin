[Hook]
One cup, two cup, add ice
One pint, two sprites, that’s right
I’m sipping nigga, I’m sipping nigga
I’m sipping nigga, I’m sipping

[Verse 1]
Zips on me nigga, like a hard drive
Red on a nigga like the roll tide
My youngins drinking pints like it’s good for em
Imma spill my whole cup swerving in the foreign
Hit to call the plug work and we got straight to Florida
Made a check on white squares but they’re not bricks
Fuck that bitch and pull her hair, that’s how she liked dick
She gone call me with the plot if she fuck a lick
In the trapper boulevard with a dirty stick
Sipping Act and smoking gas, I got filthy piss
Taking trips and making hits [?]
I just want my dogs to eat, fuck the famous shit
My partner took one to the head from the hating shit
We probably saw you on the move where my Haitians at
I can’t wait for shit no more, fuck where my patience at
We drink the red and the yellow till we bounce back

[Hook]
One cup, two cup, add ice
One pint, two sprites, that’s right
I’m sipping nigga, I’m sipping nigga
I’m sipping nigga, I’m sipping
One cup, two cup, add ice
One pint, two sprites, that’s right
I’m sipping nigga, I’m sipping nigga
I’m sipping nigga, I’m sipping
