Suck a scrotum like a lovely girl
While I'm rolling in the money, swerve

Fuck a cheap thrill
If you really studied all your actions, you'd be going off

'Cause Beebo's a man produce some of the hardest though
Just learn ya role when you talk about
The Trini man with the hardest flow
'Cause me eno dawg, it seem like yuh deaf, or maybe retarded tho
