[Intro]
Zaytoven
Yeah
Don't tell me what to do, what to do, what to do
All I do is look up, straight up
Cook up
Yeah
Yeah, oh, take it

[Verse]
What they never handed me
I'm just a young livin' out the fantasies
When life get outta hand, man, they can't handle me
I'm talkin' pure addition, that's my pure addiction
Somethin' out of nothin', we was not magicians
5AM up in the kitchen, doing everythin' except the dishes
Speakin', spammin', splottin', schemin', scammin'
While you took advice, I took advantage, cook up
Back when momma had bills, back when life was heavy as a anvil
The first time I touched a hunnid dollar bill, I had chills
Back when stepbro used to move the pills, I thought it was a [?]
He said, "You can't snitch"
Back when Alisca cheated on me, first time I turned my job into a main bitch
So cold, young with a [?]
Back when granny used to irk the [?] bill
Thinkin' "no, no", I need that [?] the low-low, ridin' low-pro
Thankin' God I had the [?]
Back when momma had the c-sec, I knew I was as special as a t-Rex
Even when they tried to treat me like a reject, take it back

[Chorus]
What they never handed me
I'm just a young livin' out the fantasies
When life get outta hand, man, they can't handle me, take it
What they never handed me
I'm just a young livin' out the fantasies
When life get outta hand, man, they can't handle me
