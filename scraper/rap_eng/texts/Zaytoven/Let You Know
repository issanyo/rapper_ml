Aye, Aye, Aye
Salute to Zay, Salute to Zay
God I got to let you know [x3]
We the new church, church
Pipe up!

[Hook]
God I got to let you know (let you know)
I could never let you go (I could never ever ever)
God I got to let you know
God I got to let you know
I could never let you go
God I got to let you know[x6]

[Verse 1]
Aye, what you tell em' phew
They like what you flexing for (Why you flexing?)
I tell them God you keep on blessing more (He do)
We done came a long way from that testicle (A long way)
Then King Jesus came and told us we the next to blow (King Jesus)
Woah (woah), that's just how it go (Oh, yeah)
Dabbing through the door, I'm a party animal (Party)
We be going up so we're never looking low (Oh, no)
We be in the city (city), just like polo drawers (mkay)

[Bridge]
If you don't know [x3]
Now you know
If you don't know [x3]

[Hook]

Aye (Aye Aye), by the way (by the way)
We be piped up everywhere, everyday (Every single day)
1k making moves through your town
I know G.O.D gone hold it down he be blessing up my rounds (My rounds)
We been lost but now we found
How much y'all want to bet we heaven bound (How much?)
I just taught the devil ain't no [?]
Shout out to my label we no longer underground (A.G.E)
Woo, Woo
