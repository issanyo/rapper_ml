[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Still in the club like an old ass strippa
I'm still in the club like an old ass strippa
Still in the club like an old ass strippa
I'm still in the club like an old ass strippa
East Atlanta nigga drink lean not liquor
East Atlanta nigga drink lean not liquor
East Atlanta young niggas drink lean not liquor
East Atlanta young niggas drink lean not liquor:)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
The truth hurts, so my gun bursts I jump feet first
Call 'Wop you need a mean verse or need some cheap work
They call me Mr. Clean but I want the green first
Got same crazy young niggas no church just murk
Dump 'em in the river and I bet they got a zipper
Or kill 'em with a temper, temper shorter than Shirley Temple
Bullets collapse your lung then I shoot you in the liver
I'm the cat, cut out your tongue now you're dinner for the critters
Things in my business so they layin' on my dick
You pussies couldn't kill me so you snitchin' on a nigga
Itchy trigger finger, itchin' pitchin' on the trigger
Underhand pitchin', yeah I'm pitchin' to the dealer
Wop was a guerilla, nigga helped a guerilla
Gucci verse the monster nigga, hail Godzilla, wow
It's me against the world and whoever ridin' with her
And my shit's still in the club like these old ass strippers

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Still in the club like an old ass strippa
I'm still in the club like an old ass strippa
Still in the club like an old ass strippa
I'm still in the club like an old ass strippa
East Atlanta nigga drink lean not liquor
East Atlanta nigga drink lean not liquor
East Atlanta young niggas drink lean not liquor
East Atlanta young niggas drink lean not liquor

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Still in the club like an old ass stripper
Still in the club throwin' money with my niggas, ay
This outfit cost me some stacks and it was Maybach-Gucci
I don't if he a trapper, rapper, or a groupie
I like my cars roofless, all of my whips coupe-ish
I mean all of my whips stupid
All my bitches thick
They owe me cause I'm lit
Catch in some in somebody club standin' on top of shit
Look at these rocks on my wrist
Still in the club drinkin' lean not liquor, ay
Scrollin' through my DM, nothin' but models and singles
Pull up just to flex on a bitch nigga then pull off
The best advice I can give my lil niggas, don't get caught

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Still in the club like an old ass strippa
I'm still in the club like an old ass strippa
Still in the club like an old ass strippa
I'm still in the club like an old ass strippa
East Atlanta nigga drink lean not liquor
East Atlanta nigga drink lean not liquor
East Atlanta young niggas drink lean not liquor
East Atlanta young niggas drink lean not liquor
