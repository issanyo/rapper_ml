[Verse 1: Chris Travis]
My iPad froze, type of nigga make your heart cold
Rings through the snow bet I'm headed where the pesos
Fuck a damn judge, get a lawyer, make the case close
Used to sip lean, plug had it by the kilo
Ridin' around town and I’m bumping to my old shit
Your new shit sloppy, sound like my old bitch
Drinking water in the club, the bitch thought it was holy
Need my spanish plug, he bring me guacamole
Shout out to my life cause I’m moving up slowly
Yet my music kills like tobacco when you stoking
And I do too so you better not approach me
I like to play with other niggas girlfriends emotions
Hate with my plug, text me, weed sell promotion
Nigga if I want it I’mma buy you'll notice
Until then I’mma keep on smoking
You throw me in the water, I’mma keep on floating
Every time I’m out I feel like somebody watching
Try’na get me, won’t be a fucking option
If you attempt I snatch your souls out your bodies
Leave you where you started and go collect my bargain

[Verse 2: Smug Mang]
Smug Mang flow be hundred up the hummer
Always stay high, I be Smug Mang [?]
With two bad twins, Tia and Tamera
Place your order to the [?], pick up it tomorrow
White horses on my boxers, T’s and pajamas
Smug God, Smug Religion, just be like a llama
Just a little rap, I don’t mean to start no drama
Smug Waterboyz and Zaytiggle by them commas
Dope boy, Air 1 with the fifth comma
[?]
I be killing, smoke and kill from futurama
Disrespect Smug and [?] make [?]
Done blue face rolling diamonds straight from [?]
Every young skin from Sasne want to be a Smugga
Smug God 2 bitches, coming this summer
Smug God 2 bitch it’s dropping this summer
