[ Fleezy : Verse 1 ]
Versace Versace , the money is coming so just sit and watch me 
I had to get on it cause these other dudes did not do it properly 
No barber for months , I been working , so you know my hairs looking knotty 
Ya do it so sloppy , so don't even copy 
I'm tryna own homes that's bigger Rome , But can't do it alone 
My team is here , we tryna be hotter than thanksgiving stoves !
I'm tryna get known , but don't get it twisted , I ain't selling souls 
I ain't selling souls , but jayz and Kanye I'm watching the throne 
I'm watching the throne , shoutout to the 19 , that's my second home 
Ya shorty is on me , yo bro she can not leave a youngin alone 
If this is poppin , believe me homeboy I'm on point like a comb 
Waiting for me to fail ? Wait for max b to come home 
Gotta switch it up , all these lame rappers should just give it up 
Bodied the track , I do not give a " what ? " do it dirty like MTA's 28 bus 
Shoutout to uptown , disrespect and you will get ran down 
Start something , and you will be man down , find you in the woods like you was camping out 

[ Fame : Verse 2 ]
Versace, Versace , I came on this beat and You know I deliver 
You youngins ain't with it . I'm wishing you would And I ain't no timber
Mastering tracks sharp as hell , But I ain't a splinter 
Came in the game to get Your attention but I ain't a ringer 
Da beats I get on I go off , You know I body it . The youngin official 
I'm smooth As silk, but no one could copy it . My team populated 
But don't call us metropolis . I'm popping O.D , but I'm not on a Molly trip 
Clap for the haters , im gettin the paper catch me in black
Like I play for the raiders and Ball like the lakers so
Tell me who greater , Bring death like laser , you
Shock like a taser , make Hits like I'm jeter , you Tripping no visa 
You slipping no kita , Talking bout money then It's nice to meet ya 
Talking bout money , then It's nice to see ya
