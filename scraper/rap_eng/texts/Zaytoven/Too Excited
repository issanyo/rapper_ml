[Intro]
I got a gang of bad bitches and they ready to do
I know these niggas ain't really the truth
Ha ha

[Hook]
I tried not to get too excited I like it
I jumped in that gatti then I pulled out like woo!
I tried not to get too excited I like it
I jumped in that gatti then I pulled out like woo!
I tried not to get too excited I like it
Tried not to get too excited, I tried not to get too excited

[Bridge]
The penthouse is pending
I fuck her like Penny
She treat me like Lennon
I never wear linen
I never wear linen
I'm never gon fit in
Get out of your feelings
I'm back on my business

[Verse 1]
Back in the coupe, when I jumped in the Bentley it's on
I'm treating these bitches like souvenirs
Fucking these bitches and then we move on
I am just drinking my Actavis
I just need kush for my allergies
I am just fucking this bitch wit another bitch
Now she gon try to go lie to me
I'm looking like I hit the lottery
This molly it keep coming out of me
My astronaut is my astrology
For all of you niggas who doubted me
For all of you bitches who doubted me
Put a hundred them things on the chartered jet
You don't like it you can come get your money back
The weed and that drink got my heart attack
I'm showing no mercy, not showing no mercy for niggas like you
Grab the bandana right round on my head and told niggas that I was the truth
Grab that bandana right out of my head and told niggas that Metro got juuged
I don't be frontin' with niggas unless them niggas be thinkin it's cool

[Hook]
I tried not to get too excited I like it
I jumped in that gatti then I pulled out like woo!
I tried not to get too excited I like it
I jumped in that gatti then I pulled out like woo!
I tried not to get too excited I like it
Tried not to get too excited, I tried not to get too excited

[Bridge]
The penthouse is pending
I fuck her like [Penny]
She treat me like Lennon
I never wear linen
I never wear linen
I'm never gon fit in
Get out of your feelings
I'm back on my business

[Verse 2]
Ain't say the word "murder", but niggas gon ride
They call the police on me everyday I'm standing outside
I got a bomb of that *rah rah*
Watch, I'll serve it all night
Watch me struggle for my enemies
They left my nigga Lonzo under a bunch of leaves
I'm just dealing with the pressure of being rich, nigga
Dirty money coming in (Free Band!)
Lord forgive me for my sins
I know I'm balling, the man
I know they'd rather see me broke
When the chain gang bout that blow
Now bitch just want this money
Pussy took me back to coke
And the DA playing dirty
Got my lawyers playing dirty
Got the game playing dirty, ay
Young Metro playing dirty
Yeah, we all playing dirty

[Hook]
I tried not to get too excited I like it
I jumped in that gatti then I pulled out like woo!
I tried not to get too excited I like it
I jumped in that gatti then I pulled out like woo!
I tried not to get too excited I like it
Tried not to get too excited, I tried not to get too excited

[Bridge]
The penthouse is pending
I fuck her like Penny
She treat me like Lennon
I never wear linen
I never wear linen
I'm never gon fit in
Get out of your feelings
I'm back on my business

Back on my shit
