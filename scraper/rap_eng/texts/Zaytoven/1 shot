You only got 1 shot, 1 shot, 1 shot
This could be my only shot
You only got one 1 shot, 1 shot, 1 shot
I gotta take the shot
You only got one 1 shot, 1 shot, 1 shot
Hey, I gotta take the shot

You take a shot at me, you better hit
If I take a shot at you, I ain't gonna miss
Hey, I'm talking swish, yeah, hey
You know you gotta take it, but you know you better make it
No mistaking, hey, yeah

One shot, one shot, you only got one
Shoot your best shot, granny told me that when I was young
Paparazzi taking shots but I won't be posing, ain't no posture
Try the same shot, camera off, poster
Wake up early morning, camera on, it's time to shoot
2k, Christian Louis shot, make sure you shoot my shoe
My home girl got no ass shot, that put her in care
In the game, make that ass shot count, make it last
With 2 mill like for my wrist shot, complement my next shot
Caught me slipping 1, but never again, you gonna get your next shot
Took a shot at law that shit didn't work as if it worked the shot
Took a shot at revenants street, certified my plat, never worth the shot

You only got one 1 shot, 1 shot, 1 shot...

You take a shot at me you better hit
If I take a shot at you, I ain't gonna miss
Hey, I'm talking swish, yeah, hey
You know you gotta take it, but you know you better make it
No mistaking, hey, yeah

When it go home, it could be my only shot
Play with me I'm at your door, play with me you gonna get shot
Hood call me sir Rock, all day long don't take no shot
Pussy niggas want me gone, I hear them talking they taking shots
Got the young niggas with me, all they carry is one missile
Shoot 100% from the field, they shoot it, they don't miss 'em
I know hard to ball, team work, my niggas they get a shot
I throw the alley up, all you got to do is make the shot
Switch to a shot of Perone, kiss my mama, tell my mama on
Pray for me, baby, I'm gone
I'm a take it, I bet I make it, who would have knew take the shot is all I have to do

You only got one 1 shot, 1 shot, 1 shot...

You take a shot at me you better hit
If I take a shot at you, I ain't gonna miss
Hey, I'm talking swish, yeah, hey
You know you gotta take it, but you know you better make it
No mistaking, hey, yeah
