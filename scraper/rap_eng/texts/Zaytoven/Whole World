[Intro: Young Dolph]
Zaytoven
Yeah
[?] what that is, bro
Okay

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
Call my bitch to ask her, can I fuck her home girl?
Fuck her like a gangsta she like when I pull her hair
Wells Fargo Dolph, I got paper everywhere
She gave me that pussy and fucked up my whole world
Count my first milli and it fucked up my whole world
Up my whole world, fucked up my whole world
Prescription medication got me in my own world
She gave me that pussy and fucked up my whole world

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
She fucked me like a stripper cooked for me just like my mama
She freaky like Madonna (what else?) and she 'bout her commas
Get it by the bundle, I'm straight out the jungle
Flexin' all summer, boy you just a runner
Keep that shit one hunned, I got on three hunned
Can't believe I done it, runnin' up these numbers
Bad bitches on my bumper, [?] is for supper
Addicted to the good life but that boy straight out the gutter
Yeah, I barely like her, but I fuck her like I love her
When we have a meeting, that's a rich nigga huddle
Her pussy so good, when we got done it was a puddle
Fuck her til she stutter, mansion with the butler

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
Call my bitch to ask her, can I fuck her home girl?
Fuck her like a gangsta she like when I pull her hair
Wells Fargo Dolph, I got paper everywhere
She gave me that pussy and fucked up my whole world
Count my first milli and it fucked up my whole world
Up my whole world, fucked up my whole world
Prescription medication got me in my own world
She gave me that pussy and fucked up my whole world

[Verse 2: Kash Doll]
Took all his money then passed him to my home girl
Sucked the soul out his dick then made his toes curl
Call me jet pussy 'cause I be flyin' around the world
If I gave him the pussy I fuck up his whole world
C-Count my first milli and it fucked up my whole world
Up my whole world, fucked up my whole world
I don't see these bitches, I be in my own world
Watch how I go up, they throw up, bitch is 'bout to hurl
He say that he love me but them back-shots make you say that
Prove your worth, put hunned K on my chain, nigga pay that
Now give me the bracelet, forty on my anklet
Bouncin' ass on that dick from the back and then he came quick

[Verse 3: Young Dolph & Kash Doll]
Spend a check, spend a check, spend a check
All these rocks 'round my motherfuckin' neck
I hopped out of something' foreign, jumped on the jet
She fucked up my whole life when she gave me some neck
Puss-pussy so tight, he stuck in it, like a hood nigga, get rough with it
Won't cash the habits, baby so sneaky, he tried to nut in it
Niggas so full of shit, change up quick, put no trust in 'em
These niggas be for everybody thats why I don't fuck with them

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
Call my bitch to ask her, can I fuck her home girl?
Fuck her like a gangsta she like when I pull her hair
Wells Fargo Dolph, I got paper everywhere
She gave me that pussy and fucked up my whole world
Count my first milli and it fucked up my whole world
Up my whole world, fucked up my whole world
Prescription medication got me in my own world
She gave me that pussy and fucked up my whole world

[Outro: Young Dolph]
I'm sippin' Hi-Tech, I'm sippin' Hi-Tech,  I'm sippin' Hi-Tech
My side bitch mad at my other side bitch
Heavy artillery, what I ride with
Money and respect, what I'ma die with
Count the first M then went and got some mo' of 'em
New hunneds, old hunneds, I got both of 'em
Fifty in my drum, fifty on my charm
Cold-hearted, I can't give a poor nigga a crumb
