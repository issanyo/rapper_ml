(Chorus)

Summer nights man we couldn't get a break
Won't shit giving to us
Everything we had to take
I've been standing out the way cause a lot of niggas fakes
Steady paying lawyer fees while i'm tryna beat the case
Mom's stressing,I can see her loosing weight
Tryna get this shit straight,move her to a bigger place
Shit changed now a nigga eating stake
Remember days I couldn't eat
Now I got expensive taste (dolla dolla bills)

(Verse 1)
Remember days I couldn't eat,I couldn't sleep
Busting every city you will never know where I'll be
I'm from the streets but i'm on big cali smoking palm trees
With a white bitch in a drop,let her feel the breeze
Remember I fucked that bitch from overseas
But i'm back to the business,got my daughter off her feet
I know niggas out here probably saying they gon get me
Last night when I was asleep I talked to Cap in the dreams (shit go crazy)

(Chorus)

Summer nights man we couldn't get a break
Won't shit giving to us
Everything we had to take
I've been standing out the way cause a lot of niggas fakes
Steady paying lawyer fees while i'm tryna beat the case
Mom's stressing,I can see her loosing weight
Tryna get this shit straight,move her to a bigger place
Shit changed now a nigga eating stake
Remember days I couldn't eat
Now I got expensive taste
