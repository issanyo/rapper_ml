[Intro]
I wanna thank God
For opportunity, success
Wealth and health

[Verse 1]
My daddy name Gucci, he the Gucci Mane
Honestly, he turned me on to the ice game
He fed the fam with 3 tops, that the con game Guwop
Well fuck you, who are you?
You ain't God mane
I fell out with my right-hand man, he tried to top on me
I guess it's clear we ain't homies like I think we homies
I'm at the top and I swear to God, it's really lonely
But I'm not coming down, no stoopin' down, I keep it movin'
These young nigga's got no respect who make music
Broke ass nigga never can get used to it
And the bottom of Sun Valley don't do it like the top do it
Bouldercrest we hear AK's more than church music

[Chorus]
In this car, horse on the car, with the top off it
Topless broads drivin' Gucci charger with no bra
Headshot dead in the bushes with his head off
Dick cut off, throat slit, block knocked off
Decapitated
Decapitated
Decapitated
Decapitated

[Verse 2]
I know Africans that cut off legs
Jamaican's that cut off heads (What's up bumbaclot)
This millionaire still in the feds
You in the county and you can't get outta jail nigga?
Damn, that's so sad
That's so bad
You played out, JJ bad
Mob ties put a head in your bed (horse head)
You touch Guwop and they gon' mummy wrap your head
I got so much overhead, I gave him diamond bricks instead
And I chumm without a charm, diamond chain and watch instead
1017, my grandaddy house and I stay next door to Ned
Cooking dope instead of eggs
Hundred PT's in my fridge

[Chorus]
In this car, horse on the car, with the top off it
Topless broads drivin' Gucci charger with no bra
Headshot dead in the bushes with his head off
Dick cut off, throat slit, block knocked off
Decapitated
Decapitated
Decapitated
Decapitated
