When I walk in this bit' I need bitches that know my name
If you reachin' for my chain I hit you with the chopper, bang
I hit these bitches from the back, I smack her like I'm pootie-tang
Dabbing in Balenciaga make orangutan

She don't know about a nigga, paper keep her out the loop
Fucking bitches by the three or fuck 'em by the deuce
I don't fuck with you niggas, you and 12 in cahoots
Don't eat from these bitches, mama said they put roots
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, never show a nigga where you mama head lay

Bricks and the bails, I'm the candy man
Got a real plug nigga, yeah we have it now
Kept it real with the street now I'm a millionaire
Got bitches in foreigns, they everywhere
Might pull up in the trenches in a (?) Jeep
Smoking on cookie with a brick on the seat

Tryna sell a (?)
(?) out the pot if you know how to spend it
I was in the trap all night working my moves
Said a nigga bout to (?) crack the dog food
Jump straight out I done (?)
Caught my first plug for a couple hundred or two
Went straight to the lot and cashed out the coupe
Spent the other seven on some whooptie-whoops
Show love to the hood like the gangsters do
Nigga I'm used to money, what I'm supposed to do?
