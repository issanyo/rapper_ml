This is Dedicated to all the Gods & the Earths

[Verse 1]
Godbody, godbody one more time godbody godbody//
Godbody, godbody one more time godbody godbody//
Rap must be changin cuz niggas str8 fosse's//
These niggas is fugazi these cats is str8 copy//
My power is divine and they dont even know it//
These niggas can't rhyme and they dont even be flowin//
Born up in Harlem but Clarence adopted us//
Teachin up the youth cuz 10% watchin us//
All gold everythin body em on site// Fuck that im bout to body em in all white//
White chick// White watch//
White whip// Black star//
Sellin out like a white star// Building up on a white block//
White neighbors//
White haters//
Dem white boys will triple K ya//
White lexus// White Xmas// Coco white wit nice breastis//
The east coast Huey P and count all the Panther shit//
30 Gods in my clique and I ain't even rappin yet//
Speakin in lingo Supreme mathematics//
Fuck all these niggas Im ultra magnetic//
Fuck all ya feelings cuz building is natural//
Im tired of rappin the kid is a animal//
Godbody, godbody one more time godbody godbody//
Born in New York spanish girls call me papi//
Can't think of words that rhyme godbody//
Godbody, godbody one more time godbody godbody//
Godbody godbody two more times godbody godbody//
