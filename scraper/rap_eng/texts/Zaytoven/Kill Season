[Hook 2x]
Kill season, kill for no reason
That pussy nigga stupid
He slipping, don't think we see him
We play with keys not talking no piano
So we had to bring them sticks out
He had to bring extra ammo

[Verse 1: RealBosses]
This nigga tripping
This nigga stupid
Sit now smoke this joint
Let's talk about how we gon do it
Moss b just bought a stick but I'm gon be the first to use it
Pull up in a foreign drop that window get to shooting
Heard police sirens but we ain't speeding off we cruising
Keep your corkers steady we gon drive like we ain't do it
Gotta get to droppin no time for making excuses
All my niggas killers and all my niggas they ruthless
You niggas trippinwe bosses we got the swag
Dabbing on these bitches thats what get you niggas mad
Pull up to the club that money comin out the bag
Clutchin on this pistol run up and thats your ass

[Hook 2x]
Kill season, kill for no reason
That pussy nigga stupid
He slipping, don't think we see him
We play with keys not talking no piano
So we had to bring them sticks out
He had to bring extra ammo

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
You ducking map vin chachew
No I ain't your dad but when I see you I map kalew
You dont know who in the car sliding in a Tahoe
I just bought another car, sitting on Forgiatos
All these niggas gotta do is go and pick a mano
Tell me what you tryna do, you can die tommorow
Nigga why you bluffing, jump out go to dumping
I ain't dont say nothing Im just straight up busting
I dont care I catch you with your auntie or your cousin
I dont care I catch you on the front street out in public
Fuck around they gon find your ass they behind the publix
Everyday 24/7 I be clutchin

[Hook 2x]
Kill season, kill for no reason
That pussy nigga stupid
He slipping, don't think we see him
We play with keys not talking no piano
So we had to bring them sticks out
He had to bring extra ammo
