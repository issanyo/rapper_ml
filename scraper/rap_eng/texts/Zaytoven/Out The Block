[Hook]
I keep my pistol on guard if you run up you get shot
Put him in a box give no fuck about no op
My niggas got locks so I’m screamin fuck the cops
All this dope money bitch I got it out the block
Bottles been popped bitch I got it out the block
Don’t you see my watch yeah I got it out the block
Gotta keep my Glock when I’m standing on the block
Everything I got yeah I got it off the block

[Verse 1]
OK bitches by the three and I’m in here with my heat
Drinkin on that lean and I’m not gon hardly sleep
I had a long day running round with GG
I came to the A just to talk about them Ps
Cash on deck you don’t have to send no mas
I got to spend a bus boy go head and fill it up
40 cal with them hollows better fill em up
Lookin at my chain I might have to hit him up
I just got a call that my youngin caught a rap
Same nigga whole hood thought he was a rat
They can’t keep it G no more unless you getting charges
Wonder how he came home he told on everybody

[Hook]
I keep my pistol on guard if you run up you get shot
Put him in a box give no fuck about no op
My niggas got locks so I’m screamin fuck the cops
All this dope money bitch I got it out the block
Bottles been popped bitch I got it out the block
Don’t you see my watch yeah I got it out the block
Gotta keep my Glock when I’m standing on the block
Everything I got yeah I got it off the block

[Verse 2]
Shout out to the few niggas that still keep it real
Them niggas who ain’t snitchin rather sit they ass in jail
The popos can’t be worried that they took no fuckin deal
I got a situation I ain’t got no fuckin deal
Before I was a rapper I had 20 and a flow
This rap shit ain’t too bad I get 20 for a show
Change up on my niggas now my niggas all I know
Boy yo ass a pussy you get chained up for a ho
I been on my bullshit ain’t been feelin like myself
But shit, I don’t feel like no one else
I’mma slam on a nigga I don’t need nobody help
Never will I be a hater I hear that’s bad for your health

[Hook]
I keep my pistol on guard if you run up you get shot
Put him in a box give no fuck about no op
My niggas got locks so I’m screamin fuck the cops
All this dope money bitch I got it out the block
Bottles been popped bitch I got it out the block
Don’t you see my watch yeah I got it out the block
Gotta keep my Glock when I’m standing on the block
Everything I got yeah I got it off the block
