Trap, trap, aye, aye
Trap, trap, aye, aye
Aye, aye, aye, aye

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
Woke up in the morning drinkin' codeine
I just talked with Rich and sold the whole thing
Lookin' at my neck it's like it's snowing
Omelly in the cut, can't stop the blowing
Woke up in the morning drinkin' codeine
I just talked with Rich and sold the whole thing
Lookin' at my neck it's like it's snowing
Omelly in the cut, can't stop the blowing

[Verse 1: Omelly]
Wake up back and I (?)
I'm already drankin' if I crack the seal
Double cup what we sippin' on
You know I'm strapped when I'm in my wheel
Cop behind me I'm scrappin' on
Fuck them rookies you know how I feel
Free my nigga (?)
I'm chasin' this guap tryna get his appeal
I'm servin' that drank and we pour it up
I have fucked bitches in Florida
I have fucked bitches in tour buses
Hold up shorty, let my bro fuck you
I'm (?) park, I'ma double back cause that pussy wet
Got Rich The Kid, Lil Uzi with me and we fly as jets

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
We gon' sip on the syrup
Choppa the crub, Uzi he pull up in Vert
These real diamonds
Pick my bitch and we goin' behind
Your bitch wanna fuck with a rich nigga
She suckin' me up but you kissin' her
I chop in the trench, I got the bricks
Look at my wrist
Lil Uzi he ride with a semi
Flyin' them birds to Omelly
Hit 100 bands juug my pockets happy
I was in Paris but now I'm in Fendi
We rockin' the dope, it come off a boat
The chopper didn't come with a scope
Fuckin' your bitch then she gotta go
Thumbs they hit like Taekwondo

[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]
Woke up in the morning drinkin' codeine

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
My diamonds cold like the winter
Countin' the roll like a Royce
Fucked in life, I had no choice
I bet my voice leave her moist
Petty Cola mixed with this soda
I'm gettin' it straight to the point
Got some niggas that down for murder and they never even gettin' out the joint
That shit is all in the way
I swear it's all in the way
Why is that all in the way
My diamonds all in the way
Money is come and it goes
Whether it's sleet or it's snow
Look at my wrist bitch it glow
Look at my chain it just froze
