[Verse 1: Future]
I bought my friend a benz
[?] friend I touch your bunny
I’ll be gone off in the wind
My friend we like to win
I say keep a guap
Hit the block and get it in
My friend is a gallon of the lean, no pen
They gonna come up with a club
Think I'm on that drinky drink again
I got strong residue, on my finger tips again
I stay with my friend
Get high with my friend
Jump fly with my friend
In the VIP standing on the [?] chair with my friend
Water bottles of Patron, like they running outta my friend
I love stuntin with my friend
Smashing models with my friend
Top models with my friend
See these Gucci's that I’m in?
Zaytoven, thats my friend
