[Pre-Chorus:]
I got a trapp fulla code 87
Now that’s me
Hit the block with them propane packs
Now that’s me
In the club with a hand full a bandz
Now that’s me
Street nigga smokin somethin real loud
So come see

[Chorus:]
I’m smoking that shit while I’m pouring that shit, yea
I’m just smoking that shit while I’m pouring that shit
I’m just smoking that shit while I’m pouring that shit
I said I’m just smoking that shit while I’m pouring that shit

[Verse 1:]
Good shows, lookin Luciano
Mob boss, comin straight from Louisiana
Them crackles wanna see a nigga in a slammer
But I still ride around with tha hamma
My partners kill your partners nigga
Whole click full a straight killas
Heffa move a little different
Kidnappin, extortion, how I feed my children
Wakin up a real nigga
Now that got to be a good feelin
Ridge Crest where I’m comin from
But now I’m out in H town with the don

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I’m smoking that shit while I’m pouring that shit

And you know we in that bitch
Real nigga we silent one hundred

Get your bitch, nigga what

Pull up on the curve, shit screaming
Got so many bitches on my penis
They callin for it, them bitches feamin

Certified real nigga, no in between it
You got me fucked up nigga with all that fake shit
Get money nigga, they on that hate shit

[Verse 3:]
Don Ke, fresh

I’m fresh, the trap on stroll
I’m in control
Keep that strong, blowin out my nose
The wrist froze
Alabama up to the A, it’s everyday
Double cup nigga
Pour the shit up and don’t play
It’s Texas, the screwed up captain Don Ke
Keep a room fulla bad as bitches now that’s me
I’m with Fresh and El Dorado, still runnin this game
Nigga thanks to cocaine I’m flawless with no stains
Nigga turn up,  it’s 713 a city king
Still pullin up in somethin so mean
He too clean

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
