[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm tryna get in her mouth
I'm tryna swing with her friend
I'm wanna give her the D
Then baby girl you never see me again
I'm tryna open her highs
I'm tryna skrrt off and hide
Don't fall in love with no lie
She's tryna fuck and get high
Guess that makes two of us
And I'ma give her the prize

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'ma give her the prize
Give her a slice of the pie
I see the look in her eyes
Used to be cooking up pies
Used to be serving them fiends
I love how she swerve in them jeans
She work my nerves in them jeans
Now I got urge in my jeans
She know that I'm all bout the bag
I keep them bands in the bag
I got a billion in swag
I am the realest and this is a fact
She be the bad and the boujee type
She suck on my dick like a crack pipe
I had to give her the jack knife
She fell in love with this black pipe
She fell in love with this trap life
She fell in love in just one night
Look bitch I don't need a housewife
Look bitch I need you to say no more
Caught that boy slipping we wet him up
Calling us gon' have to pick him up
Draco is on me, no Soulja Boy
I'm on the block with them soldiers boy
Glock on the blocks we gon' hold it boy
If we talking racks then I'm loaded boy
I ain't worried bout you fuck boys
Getting money switching toys
Fucking bitches making noise
All my [?]
Know you niggas unemployed
With a ride you can't afford
I got bitches pussy moist
Leave your bitch with no choice
Flame

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm tryna get in her mouth
I'm tryna swing with her friend
I'm wanna give her the D
Then baby girl you never see me again
I'm tryna open her highs
I'm tryna skrrt off and hide
Don't fall in love with no lie
She's tryna fuck and get high
Guess that makes two of us
And I'ma give her the prize

[Verse 2: Jimmy Rocket]
I'm tryna fuck on your friend
I got some top in the Benz
Then took her to the West End
My new bitch a ten
She get freaked out [?]
Beat that shit up, [?]
She ain't fucking with you, your money small like Ant Man
[?] pussy on a handstand
Throw that pussy on me, knock it out like grand slam
When I'm done fucking make her feed me a ham sandwich
She let me fuck her on cam
She give me head like a ram
Painted her face like a clam
She ate my nut like a [?]
All of that water might drown
And I just hopped in the coup
One button I drop the roof
You got that gun but won't shoot
I know why you mad cause I fucked on your boo
You can have that ho back yeah that pussy too loose
Damn that Lil Jimmy who started you
This pussy pink like Majin Boo
Diamonds they wet with [?]
[?] like Narnia
Hallelujah, pussy so good I'm like hallelujah
After my nut man I call a Uber
You got a gun but you not a shooter
Lil Jimmy

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm tryna get in her mouth
I'm tryna swing with her friend
I'm wanna give her the D
Then baby girl you never see me again
I'm tryna open her highs
I'm tryna skrrt off and hide
Don't fall in love with no lie
She's tryna fuck and get high
Guess that makes two of us
And I'ma give her the prize
