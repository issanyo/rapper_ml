[Hook: Quavo]
I started kicking in doors, just for money
Trap out the bando, just for money (trap out the bando)
Stick em up, stick em up, just for money (stick em up)
Young nigga didn’t understand nothing but money (Give em hell)

[Hook: Quavo]
When I woke up this morning
I told myself I had to get some money
(aye man I had this crazy ass dream last night)
I can not hang with you jabronis
Cause you know that is not making me no money
I had to cut that bitch off, god damn, all she wanted was some money
(you know I hate that gold digging ass bitch)
I can't hang with all my homies cause they handouts
Asking for some money

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I started kicking in doors, just for money
(just for the money)
Trap out the bando (trap), just for money (trap out the bando)
Stick em up, stick em up, just for money (stick em up)
Young nigga didn’t understand nothing but money (no undo)
Now that I'm up these hoes so easy to fuck (smash)
They after my bucks I didn’t by nothing but one pair of chucks (here)
I'm in the jungle (jungle) I'm from the north
Hit em with the chopper (hit em) knock a nigga off
They'll do it for the money cause they know that I’m the boss
My niggas bout it bout it pull up with missiles and sawed off
We got the green like Boston play with the keys like I’m dealing sauce
Smoking on cookie I’m coughing
You think its a body got bricks in a coffin
Heroin black look like coffee (Black)
Talking that shit then we off em
Look at yo bitch look at lil mama stalking she with me now you can stop all the calling
Play with the water like I was a Dolphin
Remixing the dope get a piece of a almond
You want that shit nigga stop stallin'
Free my nigga Offset so he can get back to ballin'

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Niggas be asking for money they thinking its funny, I don’t give them nothing
You niggas ain't bucking and no I ain't fronting
You thinking its sweet banana clip for monkeys
Its 2015 and my double cup muddy
You laughing right now but don’t think shit won’t get ugly
Turn em into bread and peel back his muffin
You finger fuck light but that give him no budget
I’m smoking on cookie the cookie jar musty
Treat the blunt like teddy bears and I stuff it
You turn to a cop when you get guap and cuff it
Bitches police nowadays they gone buss it
Back and again all about Benjamins
I’m a human being forgive me if I sin
I done been broke before I ain’t going back no more
I done came this far to fall off the pedestal
I done took a walk and walk up to Texaco
Talk to Chico finessing him for Regano
You boys so crazy you can not cop a whole one you no friend or foe
The monts in my pocket sloppy joe
Christian Louboutin Spikes on my tippy toes
Break a ball like my name is Chris Jerico
Niggas my shooters have [?]
Chop off the top like I’m Eddie Guerrero
My niggas they ride around selling marshmallows
Nowadays niggas call me marshall lynch the way I got the Seahawks flying from Seattle
Stuck in the atlanta ocean canoe but got no pad to paddle
Stay away from the snakes and you can hear them come by the way that they rattle
