[Intro]
Zaytoven
Yeah
Young Jefe holmes
Welcome to DC baby
Southside, I ain't talkin' about none of that White House shit
Yeah, haha, real DC
Bad bitches in the trenches, me and them savages
Ridin' 'round, Glizzy-ed up
We got them sticks too
Don't get it fucked up, yeah
Hey Zay
Young Jefe holmes, oh

[Chorus]
Soon as I walked in the room you know lil mama had to choose
She know if she get Jefe then she never gonna lose
Remember when you met me we drank 1942
Know you never see Young Jefe drink no fuckin' Grey Goose
I'm nothing like these niggas, girl I'm really that dude
I can't get jiggy with 'em, sorry I'm just too cool
I be with some lil fools and no they don't play by the rules
You better hide your boo before she end up on this cruise

[Verse 1]
I be with some lil fools and no they don't play by the rules
My killers ain't on IG, you might see them on the news
These are Michael Mary jeans, bitch my pockets full of blues
She say he got good genes, girl his cousin fine too, ooh
Used to eat generic brands, now them diamonds Froot Loops
Soon as he got a hundred bands, went and got a new coupe
Tell me what to do when there's nothing else to do
We just got them new glizzys, bitch can't wait to let 'em loose
Every nigga with me geekin', I can't wait to let 'em shoot
Had a bad bitch tweaking, man I think it was the boot
And today is a perfect day to get loot
I might take a trip to MIA with my crew

[Chorus]
Soon as I walked in the room you know lil mama had to choose
She know if she get Jefe then she never gonna lose
Remember when you met me we drank 1942
Know you never see Young Jefe drink no fuckin' Grey Goose
I'm nothing like these niggas, girl I'm really that dude
I can't get jiggy with 'em, sorry I'm just too cool
I be with some lil fools and no they don't play by the rules
You better hide your boo before she end up on this cruise

[Verse 2]
Come on ride the wave baby, come on ride the wave
I'm not one of them niggas who just tryna get laid
I'm tryna get paid, girl I'm tryna make plays
Tryna put you in designer, tryna put you on to game, ayy
Lil bitch she so pretty yeah, and she call me Richy yeah
You fuckin' with a gangster bitch, you know this shit get tricky yeah
Promotors in my city, they ain't even from my city yeah
Tryna book Glizzy, that's a minimum of fifty yeah
Fifty bands, fifty woes, fifty guns, fifty hoes
Aim out front that bitch, she chose
Choppers with me fifty close
I ain't never givin' up, cross a nigga up, D Rose
Put some niggas on they toes
Glizzy Gang is all they know

[Chorus]
Soon as I walked in the room you know lil mama had to choose
She know if she get Jefe then she never gonna lose
Remember when you met me we drank 1942
Know you never see Young Jefe drink no fuckin' Grey Goose
I'm nothing like these niggas, girl I'm really that dude
I can't get jiggy with 'em, sorry I'm just too cool
I be with some lil fools and no they don't play by the rules
You better hide your boo before she end up on this cruise, ooh

[Outro]
