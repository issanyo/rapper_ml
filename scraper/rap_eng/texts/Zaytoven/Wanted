[Hook: Bino Brown]
I got ‘em looking for me like I’m wanted
AR strapped, these niggas don’t want it
I keep the 380, it’s tucked under my garments
I keep it all the time ‘cause niggas try to harm me

[Hook: Bino Brown]
I got ‘em looking for me like I’m wanted
AR strapped, these niggas don’t want it
I keep the 380, it’s tucked under my garments
I keep it all the time ‘cause niggas try to harm me

[Verse 1: Bino Brown]
Bino getting money, these haters they getting mad
Walking in with racks, I’m leaving out with them bags
I be straight stacking, money, I be stashing
I ain’t got no deals, you know I’m straight taxing
Trapping out the loft, I think you niggas soft
I got fifty Thursday, Friday I got ‘em off
You step the wrong way, then I just might smack ya
Bino run the trap and I didn’t even ask ya
I’m still the same nigga that’s posted on the curb
Plug prices cheap, man I had a loss for words
Bino paper chasin’, these hoes get Nathan
They don’t like me but I’m in they conversation

[Hook: Bino Brown]
I got ‘em looking for me like I’m wanted
AR strapped, these niggas don’t want it
I keep the 380, it’s tucked under my garments
I keep it all the time ‘cause niggas try to harm me

[Hook: Bino Brown]
I got ‘em looking for me like I’m wanted
AR strapped, these niggas don’t want it
I keep the 380, it’s tucked under my garments
I keep it all the time ‘cause niggas try to harm me

[Verse 2: Jay Fizzle]
Police looking for me with a warrant
You suckers out here softer than some Charmin
Your bitch she wanna ride in this foreign
But I won’t let her ‘cause her head game is boring
I just ran up a check off touring
Then I went and blew a bag in Nordstrom’s
Got a bad yellow bitch, man she gorgeous
Led me to the plug, so I paid the bitch mortgage
Nigga start bitching ‘cause they see a nigga blessed
You can play games if you want and catch a bullet to your chest
This shit fit in my backwood, this shit the best
Have a nigga upset when I pull up in that ‘Vette
Pullin’ out the lot

[Hook: Bino Brown]
I got ‘em looking for me like I’m wanted
AR strapped, these niggas don’t want it
I keep the 380, it’s tucked under my garments
I keep it all the time ‘cause niggas try to harm me

[Hook: Bino Brown]
I got ‘em looking for me like I’m wanted
AR strapped, these niggas don’t want it
I keep the 380, it’s tucked under my garments
I keep it all the time ‘cause niggas try to harm me

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
All this swag I’m dropping, got these bitches on me
Got more choppers than a motherfucking army
Up a couple M’s but I’m still hungry
Tell them thirsty ass bitches back up off me
Paper, paper, paper, that’s all we chasing
Your favorite model told me text her my location
Every time that pack touch down it’s a celebration
Crack a seal and pour an eight up of my medication
Half a pound of OG in my drawers and you can smell it
Don’t talk too loud, he a buster man, he might tell it
All my partners good niggas but they convicted felons
Break me down a backwood and twist up a whole seven

[Hook: Bino Brown]
I got ‘em looking for me like I’m wanted
AR strapped, these niggas don’t want it
I keep the 380, it’s tucked under my garments
I keep it all the time ‘cause niggas try to harm me

[Hook: Bino Brown]
I got ‘em looking for me like I’m wanted
AR strapped, these niggas don’t want it
I keep the 380, it’s tucked under my garments
I keep it all the time ‘cause niggas try to harm me
