(Chorus/Hook)
Standing in the trenches with the strap out
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
Trap with no strap, you can't trap in my traphouse
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
Standing in the trenches with a strap out
Bales just came, finna work out
Trap with no strap, you can't trap at my traphouse
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
When the pack touchdown, trap boomin
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
Whipping it up out the crack pot
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
Serve you with the hand-chopper chopper when you pull them racks out
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
When the pack touchdown in the traphouse
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out

(Verse 1)
Standing in the trenches with a Glock 40
Showing up crack got good hard
Pack touchdown I cook hard
Lamborghini whip bitch push start
Presidential rollie bitch a retard
Serving aunties and uncles on boulevard
Been running to the crack like a meat mart
Dope on my margiella brick fair
Karate chop a brick like Rick flair
That boy right there look like a lick there
Trap with no strap you can't trap in my traphouse
We serve niggas with dirty sticks
My bitch be more conservative
She might set you up for a lick
In the trenches riding round on the sweet shit
Young nigga laying on ya wig

(Chorus/Hook)
Standing in the trenches with the strap out
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
Trap with no strap, you can't trap in my traphouse
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
Standing in the trenches with a strap out
Bales just came, finna work out
Trap with no strap, you can't trap at my traphouse
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
When the pack touchdown, trap boomin
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
Whipping it up out the crack pot
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
Serve you with the hand-chopper when you pull them racks out
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
When the pack touchdown in the traphouse
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out

(Verse 2 )
Bales just touchdown, jugg em by the ten
Serve em with a Mac 11, on the Mac 10
Birds in the fender been in  the black Benz
Got the mailman bringing in 100 bags of mid
West coast OG gas good dope
Longway on swagger to mother fuckin dope
Dabbin in residue white like the pope
Jacking and juggin in them trenches with the dope
2,5,3,5,7 gram break it down
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
Lil trap can't trap in my traphouse
Serve it through the flap, beat it down  until the work off
12  roll by, cut the lights off
Young nigga clenching on the sawed off
My Young nigga catch you slipping, shoot your blow your balls off
Catch you while you sipping weight till you nod off

(Chorus/Hook)
Standing in the trenches with the strap out
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
Trap with no strap, you can't trap in my traphouse
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
Standing in the trenches with a strap out
Bales just came, finna work out
Trap with no strap, you can't trap at my traphouse
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
When the pack touchdown, trap boomin
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
Whipping it up out the crack pot
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
Serve you with the hand-chopper when you pull them racks out
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
When the pack touchdown in the traphouse
Show a nigga how to beat the pack out
