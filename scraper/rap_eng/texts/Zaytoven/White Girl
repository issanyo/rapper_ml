[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I'm walking round the town with my white girl
End of the day she my night girl
She don't like squares but she loves squares
I got them white girl twins two pairs
I'm walking round the town with my white girl
End of the day she my night girl
She'll fight girls
Yeah she like girls
I'm walking round the town with my white girl

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
In the middle of the summer but I'm cooling with the racks
Drop top Ferrari with no fucking head attached Had to give her 200 cause I pulled out all her tracks
And baby got back but Gucci got stacks
At the end of the day im just a nigga with a sack
Flipping me a pack like a nigga cooking crack and them vogues ? eight Cadillacs and I'm smoking on the thrax like I got cataracts Gucci man a player you know I'm a player girls say I'm a boss and they say that you a square I say shes a toss but you say you wanna pay her you wanna go marry her but I'm running for mayor
