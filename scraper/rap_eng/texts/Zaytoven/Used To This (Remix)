Mexicano, i'm working like i'm mexicano
Thinking bout you baby I got that new designer
Can't overlook me dargie I overcame the struggle
Now them niggas telling me I should remain humble

Pull up in some shit, don't check the tag babe
She did that for me, said "fuck your man babe"
In and out the city with my niggas
We been all about the figures
I might spend a couple bands babe

In and out
I been in and out
Been the illest out
Niggas them, say i'm blowing up
I might believe it now
Popping on a low, they wanna know
Tell me that I don't deserve to ball

Or tell me that you love me
Girl I know you do
I ain't from the west but girl I'm into you
Love to all my paigons girl I know they hating
Say just what you like but darg you have to rate me

Now i'm seeing love, man I ain't used to this
Brodie copped a foreign, we ain't used to this (skrrrr)
Team going way up, I ain't used to this
My team going way up, i'll get used to this

Mexicano, i'm working like i'm mexicano
Thinking bout you baby I got that new designer
Can't overlook me dargie I overcame the struggle
Now them niggas telling me I should remain humble

Pull up in some shit, don't check the tag babe
She did that for me, said "fuck your man babe"
In and out the city with my niggas
We been all about the figures
I might spend a couple bands babe

In and out
I been in and out
Been the illest out
Niggas them, say i'm blowing up
I might believe it now
Popping on a low, they wanna know
Tell me that I don't deserve to ball
