[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
I got a real plug (plug), that never let me down (down)
Always come through when I need it, never been a drought (never)
Told my doubters to count me in, they couldn't count me out (count me out)
They tried to take me down with them, took a different route (different route)
I'm plugged in (in), I'm plugged in (in), I'm plugged in (in), I'm plugged in (in)
I got a real plug (yeah), that never let me down (yeah)
Always come through when I need it, never been a drought

[Verse 1]
Woke up early Sunday, Hustlin all week
Cook a meal up in that studio and let my dogs eat
Got my mind up on my mission, no time for distractions
I told my potna pay your taxes foâ€™ they come get at ya
Plus my bro just made parole yeah, let him go yeah
Did his time up in that hole yeah, then hit the road yeah
In this industry for years, ain't never sold my soul yeah
Gave em' real estate investments instead of buyin' gold yeah
I told em', "Buy a business, get a house, take the money, rinse it out"
They put all that cheese in the trap 'cause they don't want you to get out
And you can hit your jeweler, buy you six chains or
You can start a barbershop, expand to six chains
Do it big, do it for your kids yeah, get a crib
They don't want you free, they want you in the pen til' your end, Boy, that's slavery, don't play with me, I'm on my grind, right
Pay electric bills, ain't chasin' limelight, my mind right, yeah

[Chorus]
I got a real plug (plug), that never let me down (down)
Always come through when I need it, never been a drought (never)
Told my doubters to count me in, they couldn't count me out (count me out)
They tried to take me down with them, took a different route (different route)
I'm plugged in (in), I'm plugged in (in), I'm plugged in (in), I'm plugged in (in)
I got a real plug (plug), that never let me down (let me down)
Always come through when I need it, never been a drought

[Verse 2]
I got no time for no funny fool, ain't 100 fool
Told my sister, "Get yo' money boo, don't let them worry you"
Had to slow down on that Hennessy, don't need dependency
Hard to trust these folks who say they friends, they just pretend to be
I'm on God's time, I gon' feed the block, they don't leave the block
Wanna see me locked, leave me rottin' in a cedar box
Made a lot of money slangin' raps, bring it back
Gave some people jobs and got 'em out the trap, picture that
Thi'sl said he felt bullets comb his naps, let him rap
They don't care, he came from sellin' crack, they tell him he too black
Could be cookin' up that re-rock on the blue flame
Or catch you slippin' when you walkin' outta Blu Flame
Instead, I'm tryin' to put my partners on some new things
They mess around and give they baby momma's new names
The game will get you in the system but it never get you out
My plug come through every time and I ain't never seen a drought, yeah!

[Chorus]
I got a real plug (plug), that never let me down (down)
Always come through when I need it, never been a drought (never)
Told my doubters to count me in, they couldn't count me out (count me out)
They tried to take me down with them, took a different route (different route)
I'm plugged in (in), I'm plugged in (in), I'm plugged in (in), I'm plugged in (in)
I got a real plug (plug), that never let me down (let me down)
Always come through when I need it, never been a drought
