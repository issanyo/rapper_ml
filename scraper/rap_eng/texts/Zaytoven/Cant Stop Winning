Hop up in that coupe the foreign look like spaceship
AP on my wrist and pockets filled with faces
Got a lot of hoes but just one girl replace them
Can’t catch me I’m too fast man I’m going places
Hop on the stage I be so ready when I’m getting paid
Like what can I say the money changed me but I’m stuck in my ways
She asked me to stay I told her I would when I’m done getting paid
But I cannot stay because the money coming in everyday
And im so fresh and so clean
Diamonds on me looking mean
Smoking the gas only green
She always see me on the screen
She used to leave me on seen
Now she suck me no teeth
Then I pass her to the team
Hop up in that coupe the foreign look like spaceship
AP on my wrist and pockets filled with faces
Got a lot of hoes but just one girl replace them
Can’t catch me I’m too fast man I’m going places
Not gonna stop
A young killa just collecting the guap
Got bands in the vault
Flex on em with my Gucci card wallet
Yea I’ve been a boss, and I call the shots
Diamonds all on me rick Ross
I don’t know a loss, I feel I can’t fall
Cuz I be just dripping in sauce
I get 20 for a show
Hop in the coupe now let’s go
Hop in a rari
You in a lambo
Me and my bros just be stacking that dough
Laughing and passing the grass what we trapping I’m feeling fantastic when I’m off the purp
Bad little shorty she wanna get on me cuz I got the pack and more fashion than her
Hop up in that coupe the foreign look like spaceship
AP on my wrist and pockets filled with faces
Got a lot of hoes but just one girl replace them
Can’t catch me I’m too fast man I’m going places
