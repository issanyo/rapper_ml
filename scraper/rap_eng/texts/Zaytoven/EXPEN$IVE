[Chorus]
I'm expensive, I'm expensive
I'm expensive, expensive, expensive
Uh, I'm expensive, diamonds is expensive
This jewelry is expensive, expensive, expensive
Tennis on my necklace, water on my pendant
Icy independent, expensive, expensive
Saweetie is expensive, I'm expensive
I'm expensive, nigga, I'm expensive, expensive

[Verse 1]
Here's another anthem for the queens and for the ratchet hoes
Titanic hanging 'round my neck, I feel just like DiCaprio
Icy like the revenant, my diamonds dance like Amber Rose
Looking at these presidents, my loft look like the Pentagon
Before you come into my crib you better take yo sneakers off
Looking like I sold a brick, the D.A. won't leave me alone
All my weave is virgin, that's why I ain't fucking with you hoes
All my weave is virgin, that's why I ain't fucking with you hoes
I'm expensive, my nigga, never friendly
Keep his side chick Nina in the glovebox of the Bentley
All these bitches envy. How many? Too many
Out in San Jose my ese move that weight comprende

[Pre-Chorus]
Fenty on my face, cocaina on my toes
Ferragamo 'round my waist, fashion nova for the clothes
Forgiattos on the Wraith, oh my god, my roof is gone
Looking like I won the race, all this gold that I got on
Is expensive

[Chorus]
I'm expensive, I'm expensive
I'm expensive, expensive, expensive
Uh, I'm expensive, diamonds is expensive
This jewelry is expensive, expensive, expensive
Tennis on my necklace, water on my pendant
Icy independent, expensive, expensive
Saweetie is expensive, I'm expensive
I'm expensive, nigga, I'm expensive, expensive

[Verse 2]
Pablo, Chapo, Blanco, I'm Saweetie soprano
Today I might hit Fiji, Tahiti tomorrow, uh
Booking all this travel like I'm ducking narcos, uh
Tatted up my passport when tanning in Cabo
Filipino Mona Lisa, I should be in a museum
U-S-C me on them stages, gon' be rocking coliseums
All my exes took an L, because they couldn't carpe diem
Had me but they lost me, I would really hate to be them
I be in my bag, this Chanel hold hella racks
I be in my bag, I don't got no time to chat
I be in my bag, stock is up, just check the stats
I be in my bag, hunneds wrapped in rubber bands

[Pre-Chorus]
Fenty on my face, cocaina on my toes
Ferragamo 'round my waist, fashion nova for the clothes
Forgiattos on the Wraith, oh my god, my roof is gone
Looking like I won the race, all this gold that I got on
Is expensive

[Chorus]
I'm expensive, I'm expensive
I'm expensive, expensive, expensive
I'm expensive, diamonds is expensive
This jewelry is expensive, expensive, expensive
Tennis on my necklace, water on my pendant
Icy independent, expensive, expensive
Saweetie is expensive, I'm expensive
I'm expensive, nigga, I'm expensive, expensive
