[Chorus]
You can't ride on my wave, I'm too wavy
Nigga get up in my way, we gon' slay 'em
I hope y'all got him in y'all prayers
You can't ride on my wave, I'm too wavy
Niggas bitches, we don't treat 'em like it's gravy
Nigga get up in my way, we gon' slay 'em
Y'all better have him in y'all prayers

[Verse 1]
You can't ride on my wave, I'm too groovy
Cold hearted nigga, somethin' like a smoothie
I'm geekin', put a Xanax in her booty
I don't wanna fuck, bitch might got the cooties
And everywhere I go I'm drippin' Florida water
And fuck my teacher 'cause now I'm fuckin' that boy daughter
My homie been high and lately he think I'ma extort him
My young bull ain't got no guidance, he ain't got no order

[Chorus]
You can't ride on my wave, I'm too wavy
Nigga get up in my way, we gon' slay 'em
Y'all better have that nigga in y'all prayers
It's pressure and it's gun smoke in the air
You can't drip how I'm drippin' all this sauce
You gotta have a budget and just know the cost
Nigga get up in my way, knock him off
I don't gotta touch no guns, I'm the boss

[Verse 2]
That mean I'm droppin' a budget on your head
Before sundown, man I want that nigga dead
If you killed him, prove it, bring me back a dread
If you killed him, prove it, bring me back a leg
Ten bands, ten racks, ten stacks
Get five now, get the other five when you get back
This business, this motivational chit-chat
Throw you twenty more if you get that boy's whole squad whacked
You can't ride on my wave, I'm too groovy
I'm rollin', put a Xanax in her booty
I'm rollin' hard, I just fucked a groupie
Nigga get in front my way then I'ma lose it

[Chorus]
You can't ride on my wave, I'm too wavy
Tired of treatin' all these niggas like they gravy
Nigga get in front my wave, we gon' slay 'em
I hope that y'all got that boy in y'all prayers
