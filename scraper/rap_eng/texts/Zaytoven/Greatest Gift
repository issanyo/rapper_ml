Who so ever believed it, they can't be counted as one, and
I've never been perfect, I've done my wrong
And I thank you for your mercy even though I don't deserve it
Even though I may not get my favorite gift (My gift)
Even though I may not get what's on my list (What's on my list)
And there's no other love to spare other than this
You are the greatest, Jesus, you are the greatest
