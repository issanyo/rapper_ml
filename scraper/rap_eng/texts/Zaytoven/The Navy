[Intro]
*Zaytoven*
Ooh-wa-ha-ha-whoa
Beach boy in the sun
Beach boy in the s-, ayy

[Chorus]
They say I'm too wavy, got water like a boat
Me and Zay the navy, I hope you stay afloat
Blunt'll make 'em crazy you better watch your hoe
And ever since I came up I ain't change up on my bros
Beach boy run my whole town, I just kept ten toes down
Heard they wanna be like me, well that shit getting old now
These boys on my old sound, it's that new shit
Talk but they won't do shit, doink Backwoods I'm too lit

[Verse 1]
Look, me and Zay too wavy watch your lady
She drowning in the sauce, better get saved by the navy
Me and Zay too wavy, that's why they hate me
Old girl met my new girl, that's the one that had my baby (Hold up, wait)
I keep the peace like a Bhuddist
A freak in the sheets she a nudist
Let me fuck on the first night, say she don't normally do this
Yeah-a-a-yeah, say she don't normally do this
Say it's wrong, but it feels right
I get her wet like a cruise ship (Ooh)
Water, I might just fuck on your daughter
They the navy gon' salute us
Yeah, the boys wish they knew us (Hold up, wait)
And them girls, they gon' do us
And them songs, they don't move us

[Chorus]
They say I'm too wavy, got water like a boat
Me and Zay the navy, I hope you stay afloat
Blunt'll make 'em crazy you better watch your hoe
And ever since I came up I ain't change up on my bros
Beach boy run my whole town, I just kept ten toes down
Heard they wanna be like me, well that shit getting old now
These boys on my old sound, it's that new shit
Talk but they won't do shit, doink Backwoods I'm too lit
