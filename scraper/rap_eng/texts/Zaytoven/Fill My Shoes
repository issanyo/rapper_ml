(Hook)
[Gucci Mane]
I fuck her one time, then I cut her loose
I just like to win and I don't like to lose
Say the spot getting hot, we gonna have to move
Shaquille O'Neal couldn't fill my shoes
All my ? on this woman I don't like to lose
I approved everything, it ain't nothin' to prove
Fuck a lot of hoes, rock a lot of jewels
Dikembe Mutumbo couldn't fill my shoes

(Verse 1: Gucci Mane)
Got Gucci in the city
And she dance real pretty
Got a big fat ass
And some nice round titties
Wanna fuck her downtown
Call it sex in the city
She gone off ciroc
I should thank P Diddy
She come around the town
Say I'm always on her mind
And I swear I ain't never had a girl so fine
She want it, then I buy it
If I'm lyin then I'm flyin
