[Verse 1]
I'm still learning, blunt still burning
Just copped the Maserati with Versace power steering
They used to have words
But now I got none
Aquaberry diamonds done froze the tip of my damn tongue
Now I can't speak
Vocabulary like a geek
How the fuck I'm 'post to sleep on these Versace powder sheets
I'm just slipping and a sliding
I'm just i-45n
All my shooting guards got TEC-9s in the lining
I could be a lion or a kangaroo
I done got so high
I backflipped over the moon
I can't remember what I did
Aw shit look who it is its the white karate kid
They wanna call me fake
Behind my back
They call my cell phone
And ask for a couple stack
Bitch ass rappers and these bitch ass magazines
How the fuck I ain't on the front of XXL drinking a gallon of codeine
Half a million in jewelry got you coming up short
Now I'm fixsta burn your ass like a damn Newport
Had to take off my school clothes
And change into some shorts
Now I'm fixing to ball like I played 5 sports
I can play lacrosse
I can be the boss
I can lemon pepper wings like uh Rick Ross
Can't take a loss, but I can take a seat
Drop top Rolls-Royce as if I played for the Heat
Versace on my fork
Dunking on you dorks
