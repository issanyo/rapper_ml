[Intro: B.o.B]
Yo, If you are listening into this right now, that means you’ve, that means you have picked up on the transmission
Bobby Ray, bandz
London Jae, bandz
Zayto, bandz
Yah, Bandz
East side want some more
West side want some more
North side want some more
South side want some more

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Everybody ain’t a free thinker
(SHH calm down)
Every doc ain’t got a clean needle
(SHH calm down)
Every chopper ain’t a street sweeper
(SHH calm down)
Whips so foreign it ain’t street legal

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, and I’m passing by, like a UFO, like an astronaut
Saw a news report on channel 5
I done cracked the code with an open mind
They done tapped my phone, tapped my line
Spying on my notes, I can’t type shit down
On televisions they’ve reversed the lenses, now they’re watching you
While you sleep inside in your crib tonight!
Could be the CIA
Or the NSA
Or the DEA
Or the FBI
NWO, better stay awoke or get left behind
Nigga THEY
Who are they?
They the reason that Obama hair done turned grey
Nigga THEY
They the reason Malcolm loaded up the AK
(Goddamn 47)
They be passing laws every time a hurricane happens
Or a plane crashes, or a school shooting
Grey magic, that’s what they practice while you change classes!
Hire shooters, MK Ultra college students
[?] in your spinal fluid, how they do it?

[Interlude: B.o.B]
American health care victims
American death care system
Cancer can be cured in many ways
But chemo will always kill ya
They say Eazy-E had AIDS
But it ain't affect none of them children
Feel like we all feel played
Like someone should solve this riddle
Fuck it, ima go back in

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
To be known is to be a stone
That’s why I am stoned
And I’m never home
My phone be on roam
I get it I’m gone
She say I’m a dog
I give her the what?
I give her that bone
I get in my zone
I look in the sky
We are not alone
Now is it a message or is it a blessing?
Could it be from heaven, or just a projection?
I’m sick of this guessin, this shit get depressin
We should walk up to the presses
We should walk up to the president’s office
Demanding they answer these questions! (BOW BOW)
Fuckin your mom with these backward flows
Ain’t rappin them same old Jurassic flows
Cities and tunnels that’s underground
Pyramids on the ocean floor
Ey, I wonder what NASA knows
I wonder what NASA knows
I wonder if what’s really out there
Is really what NASA shows, Bandz

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Everybody ain’t a free thinker
(SHH calm down) (I know, I know)
Every doc ain’t got a clean needle
(SHH calm down) (I know, I know)
Every chopper ain’t a street sweeper
(SHH calm down) (I know, I know)
Whips so foreign it ain’t street legal

[Outro: B.o.B]
East side want some more
West side want some more
North side want some more
South side want some more
