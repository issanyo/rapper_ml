[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
My whole team winning, poppin' bottles like I'm Diddy
Do it big for my city, draco on me hold a fifty
My watch and chain [?] 'gon run above fifty
Heard them pussies lookin' for me, tell them niggas come and get me
My whole team winning, poppin' bottles like I'm Diddy
Do it big for my city, draco on me hold a fifty
My watch and chain [?] 'gon run above fifty
Heard them pussies lookin' for me, tell them niggas come and get me

[Verse 1]
I keep the draco on me and its swingin' by my kidney (swang)
And we don't shoot no handguns, them drums hold fifty (fifty)
I shoot you ten times, you ain't gon' live, you ain't 50 (no)
My young niggas go bananas, they'll pop your Tropicana (pow)
You gotta keep it on you, its a war-zone in Atlanta (war zone)
And if a nigga try you, boy you gotta set the standard (kill him)
I ain't got no sponsor but a nigga goin' bonkers (go ham)
I took some time off from the trap in the Bahamas (hey)
Boy you will lose your count if you try to count my pocket (my pocket)
I pull up in the 'Rari, they like hot boy how I got hit (I got it)
These niggas pocket watchin', yeah these niggas pocket watchin' (I see you)
Everything preordered, they be gone before I got it (gone)

[Chorus]
My whole team winning, poppin' bottles like I'm Diddy
Do it big for my city, draco on me hold a fifty
My watch and chain [?] 'gon run above fifty
Heard them pussies lookin' for me, tell them niggas come and get me
My whole team winning, poppin' bottles like I'm Diddy
Do it big for my city, draco on me hold a fifty
My watch and chain [?] 'gon run above fifty
Heard them pussies lookin' for me, tell them niggas come and get me

[Verse 2]
These pussy niggas flexin', boy they knowin' they ain't with it (ain't with it)
You can ask your bitch, boy I'm the hottest in the city (hottest in the city)
But you don't want no static, boy I swear I'm not missin' (ain't missin')
I do not fuck with new niggas, I swear that they be snitchin' (hey)
I swear these niggas hatin', but they see just how I am comin'
How the hell you got it when that's another nigga's money
And how the hell you goonin', boy you ain't spray nothin' (nothin')
But you know how I'm rockin' nigga, I ain't sayin' nothin' (shhh)
Pull in your trap, take over your trap
Draw down lil' nigga, take your strap
I live that life, you rap that life
I swear to God I'm straight out the trap
I swear to God I'm straight out the trap
I swear to God I'm straight out the trap
I live that life, you rap that life
I swear to God I'm straight out the trap

[Chorus]
My whole team winning, poppin' bottles like I'm Diddy
Do it big for my city, draco on me hold a fifty
My watch and chain [?] 'gon run above fifty
Heard them pussies lookin' for me, tell them niggas come and get me
My whole team winning, poppin' bottles like I'm Diddy
Do it big for my city, draco on me hold a fifty
My watch and chain [?] 'gon run above fifty
Heard them pussies lookin' for me, tell them niggas come and get me
