ITS LIT x 4 (YA)

[Chorus]
DoSeLit on a white tee
Same color just like me
This rap thing is a hobby
Know we lit like bumble bee
Got the chopper with the black ski
French girl say wewe black girl named tee tee yellow girl call her lingling
Know we came up from nothing now we on to do something
DoSeLit be bumping DoSeLit we bumping
DoSeLit on a whit x3 same color just like me

[Verse1
Dont hit my phone hitcha back
Need a feature ima tax
Get a coupe swerve the lane
Secret service private jet
Mad kuz we up next taking trips back to back
Two pairs shoes cost a rack(1000$)
I bet yo homie is a rat  got real MOB ties
You been living in these lies i can see it in your eyes
You been living in disguised im head up to the skies
I know he hating he a fan DoSeLit got the plan
Ain talking gaup so watcha saying


[Chorus]
DoSeLit on a white tee
Same color just like me
This rap thing is a hobby
Know we lit like bumble bee
Got the chopper with the black ski
French girl say wewe black girl named tee tee yellow girl call her lingling
Know we came up from nothing now we on to do something
DoSeLit be bumping DoSeLit we bumping
DoSeLit on a whit x3 same color just like me

[Verse2]

Paper trail be tracing

Retro 6's black cats


[Chorus]
DoSeLit on a white tee
Same color just like me
This rap thing is a hobby
Know we lit like bumble bee
Got the chopper with the black ski
French girl say wewe black girl named tee tee yellow girl call her lingling
Know we came up from nothing now we on to do something
DoSeLit be bumping DoSeLit we bumping
DoSeLit on a whit x3 same color just like me
