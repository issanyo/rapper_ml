[Intro: MEGO & DB Savv]
Ay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hold up, hold up, hold up, we on the road to riches man, got my nigga DB in the booth man, we ain't got time for all y'all fuck ass niggas man, yeah, uh, yeah

[Hook: MEGO]
I told my mama imma make it on my own
And when I'm rich, I'm on a flight headed to Rome
Why you niggas wanna see me fall that shit wrong
When you capping, I pull out the chrome, at your dome
Niggas wanna talk streets
But niggas don't wanna pay the price, they owe the streets
Niggas don't wanna pay the price, to feature me
Niggas don't have the cash, steady pocket watching me

[Verse 1: MEGO]
20k for a feature
30 thousand just to meet ya
100 thousand to perform
100 thousand on my arm
VVS in my wrist watch
Beat the pot with no arm
Cold Ice on my neck
AP on my wrist
Yeah I'm with the shits
And I ain't stressing bout a bitch
I'm steady hitting them licks
My niggas gone keep the sticks
And if you try to run up, you know they gone hit
And if you try to test it, bullets gone make you ass twitch

[Hook: MEGO]
I told my mama imma make it on my own
And when I'm rich, I'm on a flight headed to Rome
Why you niggas wanna see me fall that shit wrong
When you capping, I pull out the chrome, at your dome
Niggas wanna talk streets
But niggas don't wanna pay the price, they owe the streets
Niggas don't wanna pay the price, to feature me
Niggas don't have the cash, steady pocket watching me

[Verse 2: DB Savv]
All this capping let me hop back on my G Shit
Fucking with the gang, nigga get yo shit split
Imma big dog nigga you a lil pit
Trapping on this corner since I was a lil jit
Just know I can get what you can't get
What's the price, who knows, 30k for doing shows
Banging in the paint, nigga always throwing bows
Getting bricks like Shaq at the free throw
Road 2 Riches, it's on the way
I can fuck yo bitch, any day
For all you bitches wanna see my fall
When I'm at the bottom, I'm still gone ball

[Hook: MEGO]
I told my mama imma make it on my own
And when I'm rich, I'm on a flight headed to Rome
Why you niggas wanna see me fall that shit wrong
When you capping, I pull out the chrome, at your dome
Niggas wanna talk streets
But niggas don't wanna pay the price, they owe the streets
Niggas don't wanna pay the price, to feature me
Niggas don't have the cash, steady pocket watching me
