[Verse 1]
You be breaking all my rules
With a guy like you, you can have me anytime you want to
But now you got me too damn comfortable
Taking shots back knowing clear liquor make me lose control

Now let's make a party in your living room, no one, just me and you
Better get me right now while I'm still available
I'm out my shell, you can leave them lights on, then turn on a freaky song
And you can play it all night long

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you can play it all night long
Oh, You can play it all night long
Tell me what you want to do
I'm right in front of you tonight so
Let's do it all night long

[Chorus]
Face in the pillow
Face in the pillow
Ass up, face down
Got my face in the pillow
My face, my face
Face in the pillow

[Verse 2]
Can you talk nasty to me too
Give me what I want to feel, how hard you really want me too
And nah, I don't really do no kissing, babe
But this drink got me crazy for you

Now you got me naked, I don't give no fucks
Right now I want it rough, it's just too wild and I can't get enough
Crazy positions got my feet up, I'm confident and I'm G'ed up
I'm grabbing the sheets, biting the pillows, oh

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Ad-Lib]
Face in the pillow, yeah
Ass up, face down, ass up, face down
Ass up, face down
Face in the pillow

What you wanna do?
What you wanna do?
Yeah...
