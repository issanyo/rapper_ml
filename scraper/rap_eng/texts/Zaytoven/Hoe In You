Your bitch all on my phone cause she know you lame
All y'all rocking leather suede, y'all all the same
Know I go to [?] get designer frames
And I can't fuck with you cause I can see the ho in you
Oh I can see the ho in you

[Verse 1 - Royce Rizzy]
Got it on my own, they ain't gave me shit
I just signed a deal, they ain't pay me shit
And plus your bankroll slim, I'm just gone call you Shady
And most of these niggas hoes, I swear they act like ladies
Seen you on watch buster, swear that that's a stupid flex
Put that bitch in your hotel and she gonna get the check
Fucking with Pedro, for the low low
You know he gets brick like legos
Red bitch, roll dope though
I call the bitch tomato
I met that bitch, I fucked her in the same day
I lost the work, I got it back the same day
I got banks full, you make her do layaways
Talking bout a stupid house where the whales lay

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
I'm a young rich nigga, rocking my white tee and furs
To keep it real and make a billion, I might be the first
These haters just hating to hate, they just like being heard
But I ain't gonna lie to 'em
Just bought a new watch but I ain't got no time for em
Stacking up all this change, stacking up all this change
So many niggas in the way, can't enjoy the game
So many pounds coming in, neighbors going berserk
So many choppers in my crib, don't make 'em go to work
That's all day, I fuck three the hard way
They fuck with me the long way
Wiz the man, shorty put me dead inside her dinner plans
Damn, ain't no sense in getting sentimental
She was gone soon as they sent the menu

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Royce Rizzy]
[?] owe me money, grab a stupid juug
Flexing like my team boy you wish you could
I know you don't feel me though
Crazy hair like [?]
Ain't sweet cause my shawty on me
At a stoplight, still got a 40 on me
Sheesh, ask about me swear I never gave a fuck
Supreme Leon with the leather Chucks
If you in my presence better have the blunt rolled
Atlanta Hawks game, I'm at the front row
If you pussy, nigga get from round me
Everybody know me in my county
She sick as a cada, she give me the face
I come to my place, her [?] is laced

[Hook]
