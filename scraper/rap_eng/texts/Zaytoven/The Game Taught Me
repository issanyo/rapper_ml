[Intro]
(Zaytoven)

[Chorus]
I'll give you some game if you need some
I'll always be a friend if you need one
My momma taught me how to treat a woman
Even the biggest player still needs a woman
Fresh out the gate when I meet a bitch
I tell her, "Check it out, do you need a pimp?"
My mama taught me how to treat a woman
The game taught me how to treat a bitch

[Verse 1]
I know I probably broke a lotta hearts in my life
Quite a few, one or two I shoulda wifed
But ain't no tears, I ain't cryin' 'bout nothin'
That's the way the game go, that's the way the game comin'
I stay on point when hella shit goes down in the town
No matter what happened, I still stayed down
I stay pimpin' with my tools, that's all I need
Some bad bitches, some good weed
And if you're ever looking for me and you need a friend
Just holla at a pimp if you see me again
I never would stunt on my folks
I slow down and let the gold diggers count my spokes
And nowadays, I ride luxury shit
I'm doing 150 while she sucking my dick
They say "bitch, bitch, bitch" is all I say
But that bitch kept me paid

[Chorus]
I'll give you some game if you need some
I'll always be a friend if you need one
My momma taught me how to treat a woman
Even the biggest player still needs a woman
Fresh out the gate when I meet a bitch
I tell her, "Check it out, do you need a pimp?"
My mama taught me how to treat a woman
The game taught me how to treat a bitch

[Interlude]
You ain't gotta say no more, you ain't gotta say no more
I'm sticking with you, I'm sticking with you
Only wanna be with you, only wanna ride with you
Ride with you, ride with you, yeah

[Verse 2]
You stay talking on the beat, we got another one
If you get a lotta money, give your brother some
Why they always fuckin' with you, Joe?
Get a bitch and get paid like Too $hort
Dedicated to the game, tryna get mine
She wanna choose on me, bitch, get in line
I hustle all night and in the daytime
But if you ain't fine

[Chorus]
I'll give you some game if you need some
I'll always be a friend if you need one
My momma taught me how to treat a woman
Even the biggest player still needs a woman
Fresh out the gate when I meet a bitch
I tell her, "Check it out, do you need a pimp?"
My mama taught me how to treat a woman
The game taught me how to treat a bitch

[Outro]
You ain't gotta say no more, you ain't gotta say no more
I'm sticking with you, I'm sticking with you
Only wanna be with you, only wanna ride with you
Ride with you
