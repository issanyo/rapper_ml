[Intro]
Zaytoven
(OG Parker)
M-m-murda

[Hook]
Trapping all day to make a million
You know that I got 'em in they feelings
This bitch bad as hell, her hair Brazilian
You know that I got 'em in they feelings
I'ma drop the top, take off the ceiling
You know that I got 'em in they feelings
Real dope boy, my niggas winning
You know that I got 'em in they feelings

[Verse 1]
All the hating ain't gon' do nothing for 'em
The Glock 17, I got something for 'em
Out of town with it like I'm fucking touring
And everywhere I go, I got something for 'em
Disrespect the Rollie, gon' bust it down
Half my bank account came from selling pounds
I fucked the baddest bitches, model status bitches
I had some ratchet bitches, you can have them bitches
My OG put the jolly rancher in the Sprite
That Xanny got me sleep, 14 hour flight
County jail, told my cellie I'ma get witcha
A broke hardhead turned rich nigga

[Hook]
Trapping all day to make a million
You know that I got 'em in they feelings
This bitch bad as hell, her hair Brazilian
You know that I got 'em in they feelings
I'ma drop the top, take off the ceiling
You know that I got 'em in they feelings
Real dope boy, my niggas winning
You know that I got 'em in they feelings

[Verse 2]
All this money got a nigga overseas
Get back to the states, spend it on some keys
Coco dropped, promoters want to play
But it's a new year, boy you gotta fucking pay
Solid gold rope like I'm in the 80s
Got some homies from the (?) and some from (?)
Can't forget the 90s cause I'm from the north
So any nigga trip, we can blow the torch
She told me that her last nigga was a nothing
Glass house and all the neighbors see me fucking
Hands on the glass cause she love the view
Fuck the girl last name, she ain't got a clue

[Hook]
Trapping all day to make a million
You know that I got 'em in they feelings
This bitch bad as hell, her hair Brazilian
You know that I got 'em in they feelings
I'ma drop the top, take off the ceiling
You know that I got 'em in they feelings
Real dope boy, my niggas winning
You know that I got 'em in they feelings
