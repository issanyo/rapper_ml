[Intro: Young Scooter]
Zaytoven
Ay nigga, there's a lot of money in the street right now
No motherfuckin' drought

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
I ain't never going broke again
I ain't never going broke again
I jugged, I win
I ain't never going broke again
I ain't never going broke again
I jugged, I win
It take a lot to be a street nigga
It take a lot to be a street nigga
I got a dope boy vision
It take a lot to be a street nigga
It take a lot to be a street nigga
I got a dope boy vision

[Verse 1: ?]
I promise I'll always have my own bond my nigga
CMG shit, got money and guns, my nigga
Ay Zay, ay Scooter, I remember back when
Late night hanging with the scooters
Even before we was back in
I was late night getting it in
Strap tryna dot a pen
Right 'round the time
That cocaine music stop the trend
I came up with CMG, vowed I'll never go broke again
Told YG I respect the fact he did your boy, he wasn't in
Real nigga conversation about loyalty and domination
A plug for my niggas, ain't nothin' but street niggas and my gun [?]
I'll never go broke again, I might go back to the basics
I promise to keep my promise, and all my street niggas say it:

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
I ain't never going broke again
I ain't never going broke again
I jugged, I win
I ain't never going broke again
I ain't never going broke again
I jugged, I win
It take a lot to be a street nigga
It take a lot to be a street nigga
I got a dope boy vision
It take a lot to be a street nigga
It take a lot to be a street nigga
I got a dope boy vision
I ain't never going broke again
I ain't never going broke again
I jugged, I win
I ain't never going broke again
I ain't never going broke again
I jugged, I win
It take a lot to be a street nigga
It take a lot to be a street nigga
I got a dope boy vision
It take a lot to be a street nigga
It take a lot to be a street nigga
I got a dope boy vision
