[Intro: Migos]
Goddamn, man, that ho keep callin my phone, man
All that bullshit, man
All that sideways shit, man

[Pre-Hook: Quavo]
Ho, you too dramatic
Here go a couple of dollars so you quit the nagging
Oh no, no, no, no, I can't
Ho, you too dramatic
Here go a couple of dollars so youâ€¦
Dramatic

[Hook: Quavo]
Here go a couple of dollars so you quit the nagging
Oh no, no, no, no, I can't be yo baby daddy
Yeah, I got that ho weak, now I got that ho weak, so weak, she ratchet
Yeah, I got that ho weak, now I got that ho weak, she too dramatic
Dramatic, dramatic
Yeah, I got that ho weak, now I got that ho weak, she too dramatic
Dramatic, dramatic
Dramatic, dramatic bitch

[Verse 1: Quavo]
She calling my phone, she bitch and she moan
She talk about bitches I'm on
Bitch, just leave me alone, gonna put a block on my phone
She pull up when I'm in her area
Emojis of me in her cellular
Of Quavo in her two-piece
She got a white dress looking like marriage, bro
Ain't gon' lie, she rough, she tough, she might hit you in your stuff
Finesse you out of yo bucks and bring it to us, I fuck with the trust
At the end of the day, she psycho
Walking around with that rifle
Hate to say it, little mama, but you gotta beat it, beat it like the OG Michael
Ho, you too dramatic

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
What the fuck? Goddamn
You think that you're slick, you be the bitch
When they be run in my lobby, up in my V.I.P
Tryna take a million pics
I'm leaning on kickstand
Don't want you, bitch, I want yo friend
Excuse me, you wanna do what?
Lil mama rolling on Molly santan
I turn round look over my shoulder
Lil mama got the camera phone flashing
She went up and asked for a selfie
I told her she too dramatic
Fresh to death like I jumped out a casket
I got the clay, beat the pot like I'm Cassius
Drop in Orlando, I'm selling that magic
She calling my phone, harassing
Ho, you too dramatic

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Offset]
These bitches be tripping, I'm tryna get Benjamins
Talking my head off, she all in her feelings
Asked me for money, but never ain't giving
Wasn't fucking with me before I had a million
I'm chasing them dollars, I don't want no problems
You fucking me and you be fucking my partner
I know what to do, keep the bitch off my collar
Don't fuck her no more, then I cut off the guala
These bitches not loyal, don't trust 'em
Don't cuff 'em, don't love 'em, just fuck 'em
She telling me that she gon' ride, but deep inside I know that she lying
I know she ain't shit, she a dirty ass bitch
She gon' fuck yo whole clique, she gon' run off with bricks
Young, rich nigga, I ain't worried 'bout shit
Dramatic ass ho, you can suck my dick
Ho, you too dramatic

[Hook]
