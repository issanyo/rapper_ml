Came in the game too humble
Fuck these niggas I'm on one
I'll fuck a nigga in the ass on a track
A hundred grand and my rubber
Don't want me here cuz I'm trouble
I'm a tell you this and ain't stutter
You ain't gon' pop nothing or shake nothing if you were a bartender in this club
Bitch I'm gone
I got my goons with me
And they ain't pat a bitch down
I got that tool with me
We just bought a few bottles
Guess here who with me
My boo with me call her Whitney
She's my stool pigeon for other bitches
Get that money bitch

Told her the world ending
She saying I'm lying though
She bought me a Hugo
Guess she buying me time though
You know how I be
All about my grind hoe
Ecko logo yea I'm hard as a rhino
Fuck I look like having broke niggas discussions
Money's my other hoe
She don't need an introduction
Yeah I want all my pesos
Yeah that mean all the duckets
Free throw 10 for 10
Yeah I hit all the buckets
Say the gwap on the line
I'll be there in a second
Feeling just like the Lox

You ain't getting no cash
You ain't got intellect

Ay yo I'm thumbing through the check ayyyy
