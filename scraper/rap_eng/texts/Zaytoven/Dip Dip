[Verse]
I got a pole next to me like a soccer goal
I stay underground like I was a mole
I black out on a beat just like some charcoal
My paper so long that it look like a scroll
Moving super slow while I'm sippin on some lean
Like I used some drano my flow be so clean
I'm out of this world just like planet sheen
My shooters Go retarded just like Mr bean
I'm making this music while I'm making memes
Making so much money think I need more rubberbands
Im murdering these rappers like we playing clash of clans
All of this success and it ain't happen by chance
My money hella long just like it was a lance
My shooters all around me like I'm a president
I am so skinny just like a skeleton
My drugs come directly don't need no middle man
Driving in the lambo boy you know this ain't no ram
I stay near the trap just like tom and jerry
And I got the juice like I was a berry
I might not be handsome but you know I am wealthy
Try me and my choppa go pop like pepsi
Pull up on a hater then I kick kick kick
Like Steven spielburg I got clips clips clips
Gucci on my waist and my hip hip hip
You know my diamonds wet like a ship ship ship
We take away your grandma then we dip dip dup
