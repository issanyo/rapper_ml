You gotta see this shit these bitches do for drugs
You gotta see this shit these bitches do for love
You gotta see this shit these bitches do for chatter
Mane I tell you these bitches do whatever

You gotta see this shit these niggas do for fame
You gotta see this shit they doing in the game
You gotta see this shit these niggas doing for pussy
I see all the bullshit when I'm looking

[Verse 1]
You known them all your life now niggas switching up
You gave him all you have but ain't give enough
You tell your nigga no now he all upset
He forgot about the 1000 times you told him yes
The streets don't love you back, you can't trust your dogs
You can't trust these bitches neither, these hoes so flawed
Lil shawty sent her baby daddy to the Feds
Cause he got a new bitch and another kid
Now he got 2 babies that just they lost they dad
Hoes get in they feelings and start acting bad
This shit happens all the time, that's just how it be
I done seen it all, that shit don't suprise me

[Verse 2]
You gotta see it to believe it
She the devil, had to leave her
I don't need her, I won't keep her
Send her right back to her people
Gotta get back to this money cause these niggas acting funny
Looking at me sideways like they wanna take it from me
It's your cousin, it's your brother, it's your sister, it's your mother
Acting like they got your back but they working undercover
I can see it from a mile away, got me smoking a pound a day
Count 100 thousand that made all my problems go away
Hop in my Phantom, and holla at my driver and tell 'em to take me away
You worship our videos, fuck all your comments cause you won't say shit to my face
You step outta line, when you see me I guarantee you get put right in yo place
She thinkin' she give me some time, she be famous, so I put one right in her face
