[Hook]
The bullshit you keep talking in my ear don’t even register
You little ones outchea playing I'm up like 14 steps ahead of ya
Old school hit the block, sounding like a predator
Bad bitch she eat me up, something like a predator

[Verse 1]
3 types I don’t fuck with street punk snitches and the predator
I got real nigga, fightin cases I"m talmbot Federal
Shout out to Big Mon, he shook back out of federal
Shout out to Lil Fat, he back too I'm tellin ya
What you trying tell me, what he said ain't even register
I'm so used to hate, I get cash, that’s incredible
How these niggas hate? Hold my nuts, that’s incredible
I’m still thanking bout raris and coupes, I’m still thanking bout revenue

[Hook]
The bullshit you keep talking in my ear don’t even register
You little ones outchea playing I'm up like 14 steps ahead of ya
Old school hit the block, kinda like a predator
Bad bitch she eat me up, something like a predator

[Verse 2]
3 type of hoes I fuck with
The ones who got money, the ones who be with it
The ones who want money and love to pretend it
Stretch marks, got a few on her tummy
Had a lil one by a real dummy
I'm whippin out skeet it all on her stomach
Edgewood nigga we stay ready for summer
Ready for winter, whatever we ready
You niggas jealous or something
You niggas jealous or something
You try to love her, I’m fucking with her
You ready to die bout me fucking with her
I just want the paper take a few Xans
I just want the paper, make a few plans
Take a few trips to the Netherlands
All night flights, won’t never land

[Hook]
The bullshit you keep talking in my eardon’t even register
You little ones outchea playing I"m up like 14 steps ahead o ya
Old school hit the block, kinda like a predator
Bad bitch she eat me up, something like a predator
