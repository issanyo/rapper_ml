[Intro]
I'm living life really reckless
Fast lane, nigga, watch where you stepping
Popping pain pills to fight the depression
Back on the [?] I know them niggas telling
I've been geeked up, shoot a nigga with ammo
When you in the streets, you keep a weapon wherever
I keep it on me wherever

[Chorus]
Shoot a nigga you won't see tomorrow
I mix the Percocet with the bars
Have you ever seen a hundred large?
I trap in my Louis V chucks out the burglar bars
Don't come with that fuck shit, get shot in your face card
You know a hundred shots pop out the AR
If you don't live for today, you gon' sleep at the graveyard
In those situations, you won't make it to ER
Pop a nigga you ain't seeing tomorrow
We having sticks, get tossed
Bag fair on me, designer my entourage
I'm in the booth on the X and the Adderall
Couple Rollies, nigga, like a bowling ball
You say you street, but I know you gon' tell it all
I know you gon' tell it all

[Verse 1]
Pussy nigga, he gon' fold under pressure
Play with Hect, I'll put his ass on a stretcher
And I dropped HoodWolf, fans say I'm a devil
Think I won't blow that bitch, send me a test
Heavyweight nigga, I'll kick [?]
Fast lane, nigga, I'm mashing the pedal
Ten-bag play, nigga, meet me on Gresham
25 all the way out for the pressure
I'll pop a nigga wherever
I'll pop a nigga wherever
Pop a nigga you won't see tomorrow
I remember when we would break into cars
Now we pulling up in foreign cars
Pop a nigga you won't see tomorrow
Pop a nigga he won't see tomorrow
I popped that nigga he won't see tomorrow
I'll pop at a nigga he won't see tomorrow
And how I finesse, I'll sleep with the stars
I ran up a hundred, I'm jugging [?] bars
Me and by myself, I don't need none of y'all
Just bought a [?] on the sidewalk
I know these niggas be full of hate
I know these niggas be snake, though
That's why I roll with the Dra-co

[Chorus]
Shoot a nigga you won't see tomorrow
I mix the Percocet with the bars
Have you ever seen a hundred large?
I trap in my Louis V chucks out the burglar bars
Don't come with that fuck shit, get shot in your face card
You know a hundred shots pop out the AR
If you don't live for today, you gon' sleep at the graveyard
In those situations, you won't make it to ER
Pop a nigga you ain't seeing tomorrow
We having sticks, get tossed
Bag fair on me, designer my entourage
I'm in the booth on the X and the Adderall
Couple Rollies, nigga, like a bowling ball
You say you street, but I know you gon' tell it all
I know you gon' tell it all

[Verse 2]
I had your bitch at the trap with the Percocet mixed with the Tylenol
I had to jump out the Porsche and go run up a check 'cause my momma depended on me
I know these niggas be envy
Four pockets full, I'm having plenty
I'll fuck on that bitch before I got a [?]
Gas bags, but we started with midget
Place your order, I'ma stamp it and ship it
Twelve F&Ns with me when I'm at Lenox
Pop a nigga, hit his ass in the
Talking that shit, you ain't with it
Talking that shit, you ain't done it
You don't understand how these niggas run it
I like them blue [?]
Pop a nigga, put him six under
I'll beat the sticks like a drummer
I'll put the stick on his uncle
I'll shoot the stick at your momma
Five spots and they all bunking
Pop a nigga, he ain't see it coming
I'm in the streets and I'm living real reckless (I'm living reckless)
I'm in the streets and I'm living reckless (I'm living reckless)

[Chorus]
Shoot a nigga you won't see tomorrow
I mix the Percocet with the bars
Have you ever seen a hundred large?
I trap in my Louis V chucks out the burglar bars
Don't come with that fuck shit, get shot in your face card
You know a hundred shots pop out the AR
If you don't live for today, you gon' sleep at the graveyard
In those situations, you won't make it to ER
Pop a nigga you ain't seeing tomorrow
We having sticks, get tossed
Bag fair on me, designer my entourage
I'm in the booth on the X and the Adderall
Couple Rollies, nigga, like a bowling ball
You say you street, but I know you gon' tell it all
I know you gon' tell it all
