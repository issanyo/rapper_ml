[Hook: Chief Keef]
I roll up a 14, smoke it
Lying, saying getting money man you bogus
I'm off this drink, smoking dope, I'm so focused
Pop a x and I feel like hocus pocus
Gamble with your life, boy this ain't no poker
I'm laughing at these niggas like the Joker
Pull up flex, what?, yeah, stoned, I'm a roller
Count some checks get some neck from a bitch named Dakota

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I flex yeah get some checks hoe say I make her kitty wet
I got craft and I be havin' it like crabs, yeah that lenny man
I'm the type that piss on all my fucking mini man
My neck looking pissy got these niggas looking shitty man
I'm sipping on this drink let me calm down before I O.D man
Got my best friend but I'm still the fucking Gloly man
Since I hit the top I swear I'm a lonely man
Got a 100 shots for 20, 30, 40 men
Don't bring me Qualitest I don't want that in my tummy man
Future Codeine Crazy bitch I'm Breitling crazy fuck your Rollie man
Riding in that great white slap your ass like Mick Foley man
I walk up in the party and do my Glock .40 dance

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I roll up a 14 and smoke it
Lying, saying you getting money man you bogus
I'm off this drink, smoking dope, I'm so focused
Pop a x and I feel like hocus pocus
Gamble with your life boy this ain't no poker
I'm laughing at these niggas like the Joker
Pull up flex, what?, yeah, stoned, I'm a roller
Count some checks get some neck from a bitch named Dakota

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
It's G-L-O-G-A-N-G, she say you Glo you gotta see me
You want a verse P-A-Y Chief Keef
Your hoe will be glad to meet me
Hold up my car got to pee pee

Pistols sound like a TNT
Pull up on them niggas, beep beep
Let the Glock show them his Wee Wee
I went to go and pick Riri with my other bitch named Tee Tee
In the process met a hoe named Lee Lee, she's pleased to meet me
I'm riding in that ugly mitsu
She gave me top it was a sweet thing
I told her bitch don't try to read the tats on me they're not for reading

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I roll up a 14 and smoke it
Lying, saying you getting money man you bogus
