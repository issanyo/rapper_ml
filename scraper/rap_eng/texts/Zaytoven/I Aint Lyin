[Hook] X2
Man, I'm peepin' out the blinds
I ain't lyin, I ain't lyin
Just got out from doin' time
I ain't lyin, I ain't lyin
Know these niggas droppin' dimes
I ain't lyin, I ain't lyin
Cain't no sucka block my shine
Man I'm heavy with the grind

[Verse 1]
You out your rabbit ass mind
If you think I ain't ballin
Long money bitch
Keep it flippin like dolphins
I'ma get this bread
Till they put me in a coffin
If it's money callin
I answer, no stallin
Niggas hate to see you gettin love when you fallin
But I ain't gon de-scuss that
Where they bucks at?
Errbody wanna join ya team
Never trust that
Muhfuckers green
Cross the team
We gon' bust back
Eenie meenie miney mo
I be stackin plenty dough
Whippin up around the clock
Bitch, shop never closed
By any means... necessaray
Got so many customers
I need a secretaray

[Hook] X2
Man, I'm peepin' out the blinds
I ain't lyin, I ain't lyin
Just got out from doin time
I ain't lyin, I ain't lyin
Know these niggas droppin dimes
I ain't lyin, I ain't lyin
Cain't no sucka block my shine
Man I'm heavy with the grind

[Verse 2]
See niggas change like the seasons
Change for no reasons
Change when it got rough
Change when it easy
Niggas like campaign
Bring your campaign
Pop your 40 Glock
Like a bott-le of Champagne
Nah dog, I ain't lookin in the rear view
20-20 vision, I'm just lookin at the real view
How can niggas feel you
If they don't know the real you
Actin' like somethin that
You know I could get you killed fool
My patience and my temper short
But my money long
Niggas think I got the plug
Hit me on my burner phone
Me and pussy ass niggas do not get along
And broke niggas always ask, can they get a loan?
Bitch, you can get along
(little doggy)
Choppa bullets blow your legs off
You feelin Froggy
Watch me like Netflix
Put you on a paus-y
You must got a death wish
Coughs to my fawty

[Outro]
Man, he can talk to my muhfucking gun, my nigga
Real shit
I ain't lyin', I'll put some bread on a nigga head
Cause man, I know you niggas is racks
You niggas is starvin real niggas
And when real niggas try to finish it
Then y'all wanna go run tell the police
You know how niggas you do
Yeah
Yeah, if I don't kill a nigga...
If you don't kill the nigga
He gon' try to finger you out
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'ma keep this shit real, man
You know, I'ma keep this shit real
