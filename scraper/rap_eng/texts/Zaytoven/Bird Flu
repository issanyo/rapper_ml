I spent a quarter million dollars just to look like this
In the kitchen cookin chickens, tryin to pay my rent
Got a cockeyed Bent', and a bowlegged Benz
Pigeon-toed Aston Martin with the off set rims
I'm not like them, I done outshined him
I done flatlined him, Gucci I'm still here
Gucci don't drink beer, but he does drink Dom
Hundred thousand dollar murder charge I made bond
It's Gucci!
