[Verse 1]
Got my childhood in the 80's that shit was crazy
Thinking just she had a baby, she just a baby
First pack I ever sold, my big brother gave me
30 off a hundred dollars, man he tried to slave me
Shout out to my brother Vic, that nigga raised me
Remember when I seen a brick, it was amazing
First pistol I ever had, you know I stole it
First car I ever bought, you know they stole it
My uncle still smokin dope, but I can't judge them
I probably never get to vote, and ain't that ugly
I might just try a new approach, but that is doubtful
And I ain't gotta buy shooter, I keep a house full

[Hook]
I was wasted last night I swear it was a blur
Can't remember shit, but I know I wore bur
Big super duper bad bitch what I prefer
And you's a pussy ass nigga, that's what I concur
Pull up in my super sport, smokin super purp
Dope jumpin out the gym, I got super work
These niggas super duper hating cause they super lame
Super charger, got the super duper going on, super

[Verse 2]
Different, recognize, stickin out like a porky pine
45 on my waist, I shoot this up like Columbine
Drive by, bah bah, I'mma shoot for all mine
Gucci I'm not hard to find, I come back with my seat reclined
Twirl talk, cook it, chicken pot pot
This might be on bail or some, cause she let me slide by
Wise guy, mob ties, better have your shoes tied
Your girl know you a bitch nigga, she went and got her tubes tied
Room full of camera people, I'mma let you slide
Last nigga tried the stupid shit, that nigga died
The earth it ain't big enough for us so one day gon collide
And I ain't waitin on nobody protect me, I'mma ride

[Hook]
