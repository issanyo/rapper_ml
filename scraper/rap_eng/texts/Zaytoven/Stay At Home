[Intro]
Zaytoven
Big time
A-Town
Double down
Yeah yeah

[Chorus: Usher]
'Til you been driving me crazy, 'til you been driving me crazy
Who you been texting daily, who you been texting daily
You know I don't do fugazi, you know I don't do fugazi
(Mhm, yeah, you know I don't do fugazi)
I hope you ain't lettin' him hit it, I hope you ain't lettin' him hit it
I hope you staying ambitious, I hope you being committed
Perpetrating them feelings, but that ain't the way you get it
(That ain't the way, that ain't the way)

[Verse 1: Usher]
You got too much cash be cautious
Never would admit you were starstruck
Thought about putting you in the Lambo truck
Thought about pulling out the brains, truck
Turn up the vibes in the main coast
So much drip need a raincoat
From Mexico to Tokyo
Hotel suite like a fashion show
Jameson is for the answers
I'll kill a nigga like cancer
Put on more rings than Cassius
Popping champagne out in Paris
Water my team, do better karats
No time to scheme, we livin' lavish
Hard to believe, how much karats
What I been through, you can't imagine
Turn up the juice, walk through the water
Bright berry booze, yeah
Soon as you seen me, started recording
Got something to prove
Saving my tax screenshots
Breaking the rules
You can't be jealous
A whole lot of bitches that hang with the crew

[Bridge: Usher]
Oh-oh-oh
Only if you knew, then you know, and you know
Money fast, money fast, never slow
No need to boast, having a toast, doing the most

[Verse 2: Future]
Wanna ride in the Ghost? (Wanna ride in the Ghost?)
Wanna feel like you're floatin'? (Wanna feel like you're floatin'?)
Phantom look like a boat (Phantom look like a boat)
Five karats my rope (Five karats my rope)
Look like I sell dope (Look like I sell dope)
Put some fur on my coat (Put some fur on my coat)
And them diamonds, they choke (And them diamonds, they choke)
Like I'm playing with they coat (Playing with they coat)
I was playing with they hoes
Some friends some foes
Hunnid M's in my bank account
Had to set some new goals

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
I was dripping the water out
That would leave a bitch cold (That would leave a bitch cold)
Had to call up the fire department
I was burning up dope (Burning up dope)
I was getting my money right
Then I went Pluto (Then I went Pluto)
And it could've been perfect timing
I was already on (I was already on)
Tell me you havenâ€™t been lying
'Cause I don't condone it ('Cause I don't condone)
You got a rock, started to keep your ass at home (Keep your ass at home)

[Chorus: Future]
Tell you been driving me crazy, tell you been driving me crazy
Who you been texting daily, who you been texting daily
You know I don't do fugazi, you know I don't do fugazi
(Neck, wrist, finger, you know I don't do fugazi)
Hope you ain't lettin' him hit it, hope you ain't lettin' him hit it
I hope you staying ambitious, I hope you being committed
Perpetrating them feelings, but that ain't the way you get it
(The way you get it, that ain't the way)

[Post-Chorus: Future & Usher]
I was dripping the water out
That would leave a bitch cold (That would leave a bitch cold)
Had to call up the fire department
I was burning up dope (Burning up dope)
I was getting my money right
Then I went Pluto (Then I went Pluto)
Couldn't have been more perfect timing
I was already on
Tell me you haven't been lying
'Cause I don't condone
You got a rock, starting to keep your ass at home

[Outro: Usher]
Oh, oh
Keep your ass at home
Need to stay at home
Stay at home, yeah
Yeah
