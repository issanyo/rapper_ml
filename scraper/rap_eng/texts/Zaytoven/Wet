Zaytoven

[Chorus]
Pussy
Wet, paint
Wet, Forgee
Offa, Set
Gang, through this bih
Wet
What did I tell ya, what did I tell ya, what did I tell ya, what did I tell ya
Wet
What did I tell ya, what did I tell ya, what did I tell ya
Wet
What did I tell ya, what did I tell ya, what did I tell ya
What did I tell ya, what did I tell ya, what did I tell ya

[Verse 1]
What did I tell ya this bih got some head like a muhfuckin' [?]
Pussy so wet like a nigga been spraying her wit water hose
How did the shit even get like that
Where did the shit even come from
I’ve been a back heater from the back
Sometime it feel like my nose run
When we hit the block yeah the shows on
Like one of your favorite little shows on
I put your favorite lil' hoes on
Told her to put a lil' clothes on
I'm good on that pussy you’re so wrong
My last hoe was goin' through both of 'em
Crazy but she got that wet wet
I play the game like a real vet
I play the game like a redneck
I stack my paper like this long
I stack my paper like this long
Gotta get it up in there who got up in there
He miss a year old then you miss a year old
You shouldn't've tried to be hero
That ain’t even what that bih here for

[Chorus]
Pussy
Wet, paint
Wet, Forgee
Offa, Set
Gang, through this bih
Wet
What did I tell ya, what did I tell ya, what did I tell ya, what did I tell ya
Wet
What did I tell ya, what did I tell ya, what did I tell ya
Wet
What did I tell ya, what did I tell ya, what did I tell ya
What did I tell ya, what did I tell ya, what did I tell ya

[Verse 2]
What did I tell ya fuck the police
Run in there
Tell on that bih
Yeah I'ma savage can’t even tell it
Your bitch in that bih but the ten on my side
And you can’t even tell it
She was sucking me up anyway
I was having such a lovely day
Made a forty off of one play
Made her fall yea one day
Everybody getting up with
Anybody who fuck with
Hit the block nigga wet wet
Me and Tameka
Bih crazy than a mufucka
So we had to leave her

[Chorus]
Pussy
Wet, paint
Wet, Forgee
Offa, Set
Gang, through this bih
Wet
What did I tell ya, what did I tell ya, what did I tell ya, what did I tell ya
Wet
What did I tell ya, what did I tell ya, what did I tell ya
Wet
What did I tell ya, what did I tell ya, what did I tell ya
What did I tell ya, what did I tell ya, what did I tell ya

[Outro]
What did I tell ya now
