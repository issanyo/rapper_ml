[Intro]
Zaytoven
Nigga all we do is count up
Nigga all we do is count up
I'm balling with no deal, nigga

[Chorus]
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (Lets go)
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (Count up)
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (Uh-uh)
I got it out the streets making drug deals (Crack)
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (With no record deal)
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (BMG)
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (Freebandz)
I got it out the streets making drug deals

[Verse 1]
Drug dealing’s all a nigga's ever known
Convicted felon's all my record’s ever shown
A hundred bricks of raw, nigga, I done seen it all
Got the same shit the rappers got I'm always balling
Two hundred extra grams, I whipped it out the water
Real diamonds on my wrists, look like clear water
I just left Florida, out of Florida-Georgia
I get you anything you want, I put that on my daughter
I place any order, just like California
Prices so cheap, niggas think I'm growing it
I bought a whole street, just to say I own it
With no deal I get ten stacks for a show, nigga

[Chorus]
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (Lets go)
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (Count up)
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (Uh-uh)
I got it out the streets making drug deals (Crack)
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (With no record deal)
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (BMG)
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (Freebandz)
I got it out the streets making drug deals

[Verse 2]
I get tax free money, I'm like fuck a deal
Guap say he got a jug up in Knoxville
I put the streets first before this fucking rap
You know I'm still jugging out that dirty trap
I wrap up anything in Saran wrap
That label ain't got no mil, they better fall back
Them remixed bails, I got all that
A house full of square, y'all never saw that
Thats why I'm in the streets and I don’t need no deal
Still walk around the hood but I got plug deals
Thats how I built my lane off of drug deals
I got Freebandz, Scooter balling with no record deal

[Chorus]
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (Lets go)
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (Count up)
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (Uh-uh)
I got it out the streets making drug deals (Crack)
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (With no record deal)
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (BMG)
Young Scooter balling with no record deal (Freebandz)
I got it out the streets making drug deals
