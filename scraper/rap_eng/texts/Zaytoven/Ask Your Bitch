[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
I got 10 grams of strong in the Raw cone
Yo bitch jumped in my car with no drawers on
You still got it cause you got babbage man I'm out going
I'm iced out but I ain't even got it all on
Uncle Tommy keep a back up plan to  fall on
I'm doing shows but still got 5 plugs to call on
My favorite tool was the scale before the microphone
Post up in yo hood with the sack and treat it like its home
Fuck the rap game its full of flodgin' ass niggas
I came from the hood with nothin' but robbin' ass niggas
Most of these niggas lame as fuck, I never had no cake
Yet everyday my birthday that's why we celebrate
This bitch all up in a rich niggas face
Ay nigga come get this bitch and put her in her place
You see this shit around my neck boy I die about it
Used to be fucked up then I got a million, nigga I ain't crying about it

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I just scratched your main bitch off my list nigga
I spent your favorite rapper advance on my wrist nigga
I’m eating steak and drinkin' syrup in Ruth Chris nigga
You wanna know who running shit go ask your bitch nigga

I just scratched your main bitch off my list nigga
I spent your favorite rapper advance on my wrist nigga
I’m eating steak and sippin' syrup in Ruth Chris nigga
You wanna know who running shit go ask your bitch nigga

Verse 2
I just ask your sister what that pussy hit for
I just scratched your main bitch off my list bruh
Got a spot out of Vegas just to have the paper
Got a house out in Bartley Judy to hide the choppa
Glock 96 pounds stashed it in my locker
Went to class and told the teacher I ain't doing shit
If I ain't selling weed, I'm skipping school with a bitch
Guess who baby mama DM me say "you the shit"
I would tell you but I'm always starting shit
This Rollie got them Hammer Time rocks they too legit
I'm all about my paper, I don't indulge in foolishness
Yeah you a career rapper but I really know you a bitch
These rappers mad at me they asking what's the big deal
To get where I'm at, These suckers signed 6 deals
Just got a 60 pack and hit em at your bitch crib
I ain't got no rap enemy, I'm just shittin' on the industry

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I just scratched your main bitch off my list nigga

I just scratched your main bitch off my list nigga
