[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on

[Chorus]
I pray you never leave me (Leave me)
'Cause I could never live without you (Live without you)
I hope that you believe me (I hope, I hope)
When I tell you how much I need you (How much I need you)
By my side, don't leave me (Don't leave me)
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
Don't leave, don't leave
'Cause I remember when you left me
Had me feelin' like my whole life was through (My whole life)

[Verse]
I had my head down when you left me
Couldn't pay my rent, slept in the streets
I'm thinkin', why the fuck would you divorce me?
I know I did you wrong, but you all that I need
We got a lot of issues, please don't leave
Over a hundred M's is where I'm supposed to be
Sell everything I own just to have you back
You ever leave me again, I'll have a heart attack

[Chorus]
I pray you never leave me (Leave me)
'Cause I could never live without you (Live without you)
I hope that you believe me (I hope, I hope)
When I tell you how much I need you (How much I need you)
By my side, don't leave me (Don't leave me)
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
Don't leave, don't leave
'Cause I remember when you left me (Ohh)
Had me feelin' like my whole life was through (My whole life)
