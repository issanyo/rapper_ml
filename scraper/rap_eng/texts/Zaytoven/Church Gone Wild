[Intro: 1k Phew]
Zay' got the bass thumpin'
Feeling like Kirk by the way I'm stompin'
We be goin' up got the whole place jumpin'
Tell the whole world that we up to somethin'
We the new church got the whole world jumpin'
Puttin on for real we ain't got time for frontin'
But I got to let you know...

[Hook: 1k Phew]
Church Gone Wild [x8]
We the new church I'ma say it out loud
Been piped up for a good little while
Steppin' on chairs
Jumpin in crowds
Been piped up for a good little while
Church Gone Wild [x8]
We the new church I'ma say it out loud
Been piped up for a good little while
Steppin' on chairs
Jumpin in crowds
Been piped up for a good little while

[Break: Tonio]
Hold up, wait a minute Phew what you gonna do?

[Verse 1: 1k Phew]
Hey I'ma go and get piped up with the crew
We the new tip but it ain't nothing new
Piped on the east coast and the west coast too
On the west coast too
You be going wild like it ain't no zoo
Pulling off for the man everybody know who
So we gonna have our way
I'm talkin bout today
All day erry day
Everybody go 'cray
Tell the old church that we don't play (no way)
Oh Lord, they caught going off
But they better catch up like Andrew Maynard
I'ma hit them folks with the peace de ali
I'ma hit them folks with the pizza cambodi
I'ma rock it out real low real low
Real low real low
Like I'm playing limbo

[Bridge: 1k Phew]
I bet they won't get turnt[x9]

[Hook: 1k Phew]

[Break: 1k Phew]
Hold up, wait a minute Tonio what you gonna do?

[Verse 2: Tonio]

Feeling like reece friend like friend like woo

[Verse 3: 1k Phew & (Tonio)]
Uh, uh don't you sneeze on me!
Flow so cold don't freeze on me
(1k don't you freeze on me)
(Grandma don't you freeze on me)
Man they need to open the door (they do)
'Cause we are not playing no more (uh huh)
If you coming with us then let's go (let's go)
If you coming with us then let's go (let's go)
Let go let go
