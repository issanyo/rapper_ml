(Hook)
8th grade nigga had braids
Freshman year, a nigga tried the fade
Sophomore year had dreads
Had to grow up and get some bread
Nigga tried be looking for the feds
Fuck nigga, fuck what you said
Bitch, I’m working tryna get some bread
You a little thotty, give me head (I want the top)

(Verse)
Bitch, I’m in this shit, bitch, I’m cashing
Bitch, I got them bands, ain’t no asking
Bitch, give me top, fuck your ass
Louis V, Gucci, know I’m cashing (Louie, Gucci)
Say fuck the glo, that shit your ass
Pull up, pistol packing, we attacking (Aye, aye)
Niggas say they savage, man, keep trappin'
It’ll happen, nigga, no rapping
Pull up on your block, pistol popping
Better have your mans and your shotters
Shoot you in medulla of the tooka
Niggas ain’t on shit, niggas losers
Use the XK or the Ruger
Pull up at your home, we still gonna shoot you
Police can’t save you or your mama
Niggas talking like they ready for drama
Use the Nickel or the Llama
Coming hard like a nigga Osama
Just to find me, need Obama
Just know this glo gangs fucking summer
