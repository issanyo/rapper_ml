[Pre-Hook]
I can’t fuck with you, I’m sorry
Baby, I don’t want to argue
I just want to hit it from the back
Rich nigga all about a check
Bitch want the money, better work for it
Got big faced hundreds, you can twerk for it

[Hook]
Work for it, work for it
Bitch want the money, she can work for it
Rich nigga with a check, got bands on deck
You ain’t getting this money, better work for it
Work for it, work for it
Bitch want the money, she can work for it
Rich nigga with a check, got bands on deck
You ain’t getting this money, better work for it

[Verse 1]
Baby working with the money, she can work for it
Bitch too foreign, no passport
Young nigga got bricks like a backboard
Back of the Maybach, got an escort
Drop it, drop it down low for a rich nigga
Every time I come around she want to take pictures
See that bitch in the club, she a go getter
Pulling up in a Benz with a ho with her
Work for it, got a bitch on the boulevard
Getting wet like a surfboard
Came up from the bottom, got big face hundreds
Bout to steal more, give the ho none
Having, dabbing, capping and trapping
Wrapping the work in a pack
She sucking me off like a vacuum
Fucking your bitch with no Magnum

[Hook]
Work for it, work for it
Bitch want the money, she can work for it
Rich nigga with a check, got bands on deck
You ain’t getting this money, better work for it
Work for it, work for it
Bitch want the money, she can work for it
Rich nigga with a check, got bands on deck
You ain’t getting this money, better work for it

[Verse 2]
Stripping in clubs, she twerking, working
Tryna pay the bills, that’s urgent
I got all blue hundreds, bitch work for it
She’ll turn into a freak behind locked doors
Run with the bricks in the Birkin, nervous
Nigga I’m sipping and serving
22 bricks in my robins, MCM bag gotta call me
You a damn fool, tryna cuff a free ho
Imma take that bitch, no repo
In the track and I’m moving them elbows
Stuck in the trap, no Velcro
You gon stay broke, cooking [?]
Got a Puerto Rican bitch, no visa
And I’m sipping on pink, no Easter
I got way more keys than Alicia

[Hook]
Work for it, work for it
Bitch want the money, she can work for it
Rich nigga with a check, got bands on deck
You ain’t getting this money, better work for it
