Ok I wake up in the morning
With a bitch I don't even know
And it's sunday morning
And church I don't even go
Trying to put down that young jeezy and go
Time to let the people know
I can't count the time
We done hit the convient store
Real shit I had to let that true religion and jeezy go
I've seen too many people in it
I ain't saying leave the store
I'm a leader though
Follow me on twitter ho
Y'all talking bricks
But bitch we just got rid of four
Shit get critical
Even get a little physical
Don't care none about no bitch
Bitch I feel like mystikal
Survive through the difficult
I've been with them different folks
Ain't even made it yet
What the fuck they hating on Cooley for
