Woo! Ay ay your girl trynna leave with me
Woo! Ay ay Zaytoven on the beat
Woo! Ay ay Balenciagas on my feet!

[Verse 1:]
I could really really swipe a snatch up on yo' bitch
Just cause I'm handsome and rich
Balenciagas in a Yeezy 350, my fit
3 bands I already spent
My nigga jiggy spent about 50 bands at the strip
Magic be lit as a bitch
I was really finna chill at the crib and do shit
But I'd rather fuck with your chick
PontiacMadeDDG really the hottest on YouTube
Search me I'm really that dude
I'm been getting views before Drizzy Drake dropped his "Views"
Now I'm cookin in a stu'
Chewing Benihanas when I get hungry for food
I'm in a rich nigga mood
Walk to class in Balencies when I go to school
Freshest nigga at the U!

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
All these niggas waiting for the same thang
Stand in line for the same thang
I don't wait for the same thang
Shoes out of their price range
I don't think about the money
Money made to be spent
When I do spend the money
I'mma spend somebody's rent
Ring ring call my nigga jiggy
Magic city spent a good 50
Only family when It get frizzy
I don't fuck with many cause them boys iffy
Club eleven, four five
Pat me down when I'm outside
Peep the kicks when I'm inside
Smell the rich when I walk by
I don't like to brag
But she love my swag, I ain't doing bad
Maybe it's the cash
Gold diggin' nigga, good riddance ,I
Got a lot of that
Fly to ATL next morning nigga
We gon' spend a rack
We gon' get it back
Spent it on Balencies
Blood shot nigga, all red
They was only 650
I go shopping when the mall dead
I don't like it when it's buzy
That shit can get tricky
New hundred sticky
Pissed a band quickly,Ay
