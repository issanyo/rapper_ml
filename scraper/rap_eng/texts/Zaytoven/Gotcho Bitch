[Intro: Famous Dex]
Yeah, wah?

Thirty three come with my Glock
Thirty three come with my Glock
Gettin this money I swear I won't stop

Polo he writin' the beat, Zaytoven writin' the beat
I fuck your bitch every week, what? yeah
Yeah, uh, yeah, wait

[Verse: Famous Dex & Lil Wop]
Thirty three come with my Glock
I get the money don't stop
I got the dope in my sock
Servin' the [?] who trap on the block
I got your bitch in my spot
She got her hand in the pot
Whippin' that shit 'til it lock
[?], I trap with the pot
This lil boy know he a flop
Draco make his heart stop
I bought the [?] off the lot
Ride with the Glock, yeah we ride with the mop
Bitch it's Dexter and Lil Wop
Fuck on your bitch, she a thot
Out the window with the chop
Hold on Wop, wait
I run up and shoot up your team
I be buzzin' off a bean
My bitch all in magazines
Ball all day, yeah I ball all [?]
Geekin' off the lean, I done fell asleep
Four AM in the trap, nigga gotta eat
Trappin' out my granny house, the judge be goin' brazy
Young slime niggas with them sticks like the navy
He don't want no smoke, yeah I put that on my baby
Roll the window down, pistol poppin' at the vacant
Diamonds on my chain, everybody looking crazy
I'm sippin' lean, pour a six, now I'm lazy
Baby girl slop me in the bathroom 'cause she crazy
Wait, she suck my brozay [?] and went brazy
I got these diamonds on my wrist
Diamonds they look like some piss
Niggas talkin' like some fish
I ain't respond to your diss
Keep my thirty on me and Wop
I saw a nigga's face, make his heart stop

[Interlude: Famous Dex & Lil Wop]
