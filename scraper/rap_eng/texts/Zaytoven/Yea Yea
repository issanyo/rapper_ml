[Verse 1]
He always pulling up with x all on his fingers
He stay rolling papers, but I like swisher sweets
Baby I like what you got and what you doing
I'm tryna see if I can get into it, you're tryna get into it
He said "shut up and lay your body down"
(Cause I know what I'm doing, I know what I'm doing)
It ain't nothing you can tell me now
(I can see right through ya, I can see right through ya)

[Verse 2]
We made love when we was in Jamaica
Flew back to that ace, walking on good Jamaica
Went back to my place, you know I stay in [?]
Gotta change the curtains, everybody looking
You heard me, I was on it, I rode him like a pony
I know just how you want it, don't act like you don't want it
Your cake and eat it too
Yeah you, yeah you know what you do, to me, to me, to me
