[Verse 1: Quavo]
Flexed up riding round like riding round the paper
I just hit a juug for a quarter million dollars
Young nigga juugin' cue the twelve hundred dollars
Now a nigga growed up I'm juugin' million dollar houses
Drinking on Codeine man i got a lean fountain
Young rich nigga building houses on a mountain
Yellow mama bad but i gotta train her early
Do you know how to whip whip and cook a birdy
Call up pedro he send me to fergy
Pull up in the lamb why am I so early
Diamond doing acrobatics I got mathematics
Shawty acting so dramatic quavo cinematic

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Young nigga eighteen but i got a quarter mill
Fucking these bitches and counting the benjamins this is the life that im living
Pull up in Bentley's im dropping the top on my ceiling this how im feeling
Two Puerto Rican hoes a bag full of money i swear to God nigga we winning
A quarter mill juug ain't shit
Got forty bands sitting on my wrist
Pulling up in the lamb with your bitch
You giving her kisses while she sucking my dick
Call up pedro for the lean i need the codeine
Terminator wrist game my wrist a machine
Twenty five bricks gave a free brick to the j's
Neck got so many chains on you mistake me for a slave
Forty diamonds in my [?]
You can give me fifty thousand if you want that brick of yay
