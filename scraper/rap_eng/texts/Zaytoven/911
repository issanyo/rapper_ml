[Hook: Young Dolph]
These bad bitches love a nigga, you know that bout
Got that 911 parked in front of my trap house
Momma said "what the fuck, boy you flippin' out"
Got that 911 sittin' outside the trap house
Welcome to my world where I do this shit they rap bout
Got that 911 parked in front of my trap house
Got that 911 sittin' in front of my trap house
Got that 911 sittin' outside  my trap house

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
I was chillin' in South Memphis, bumping Jeezy trap or die
Gettin' 10 thangs in the weekend I ain't never have to try
Trappin' ain't dead, man these niggas just some pussies
My nigga just caught a quarter million and smoked up all the cookies
Your bitch played in her pussy, claim she on
But nigga I took that and made her bring her best friend too, cause that bitch kept lookin'
Girl you so fine I wanna turn you around from the back and give you a whoopin'
It's back to my trap house, where we don't do no cookies
No bakin' soda, no [?], got plenty P's I sold some pie
Yea bitch I'm the weed man, just bought all the pints from the lean man
Got a couple choppers, lotta sandwich bags
Dolph just parked the drop on the block

[Hook: Young Dolph]

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Foreign parked in the front
A couple of oldschools in the back
All the work gone, so we ain't doin' nothing but fucking bitches in the trap
If I get a hoe to your bitches it's a wrap
Dope boy in my free time I rap
Don't get me confused with none of these rappers
Bitch I'm your baby daddy, baby trapper
Make your hoe your salary in my neighbourhood, three days
Even my neighbour smoke weed, so yeah my neighbour good
Nigga I got my neighbourhood watch, so if you try to get in my spot
Nigga you might just make it not out
[?] sittin' in that vacant house
Don't know what these niggas all believe , but we on that paper route
If it ain't about money I don't wanna hear it
And if that bitch ain't bad, I ain't going near it
