[Intro]
Yeah, huh, Big 14 bitch
Yeah, hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 1]
First off, I can't trust a bitch
Break a bitch down like a mother fuckin' brick (like a brick, yeah)
I can paint a picture with my mother fuckin' wrist
Johnny Dang did my grills, I ain't talkin' with a lisp
It's Big 14, little bitch come take a flick (take a pic, bitch)
Catch yo' bitch suckin', swallowin' my fuckin' dick (on my dick)
Water on my body got a nigga seasick (ha)
Blowin' all this dope, it got me fuckin' seein' shit
Talk down on the gang, you get killed fo' sure though (boom, boom, boom)
Turn your whole gang extinct, bitch, like a dodo
I don't fuck with twelve, I can't get caught up with popo
Or imma do the dash and hit they ass with this .44 (woah, woah, woah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I like to talk that shit, like to talk that shit
Only difference 'bout me is I will walk that shit
Like to talk that shit, like to talk that shit
Only difference 'bout me is imma walk that shit

[Verse 2]
I just copped new Mason Margiela
Known to make it rain so I use my Wraith umbrella
Hangin' with the OGs and some dope sellers
And we in too deep, nothing you can tell us
Draco hit 'em up, fill a nigga up with lead
Shoot a nigga in his head, 'til he dead, 'cause this beam is infrared
Like a teddy bear that talk, try me bitch, bitch I'm Ted
Play with shooters, they gon' do you, I'm a nightmare, yeah
Freddy Krueger, uh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I like to walk that, and I talk that
Man I walk that, and I talk that
(Ay, walk it like I talk it, walk it like I talk it)
Said I walk stacks, and I tote racks, and I tote- (bitch, bitch)

[Chorus]
I like to talk that shit, like to talk that shit
Only difference 'bout me is I will walk that shit
Like to talk that shit, like to talk that shit
Only difference 'bout me is imma walk that shit

Yeah
