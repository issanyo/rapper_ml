(Chorus)
Baby, do you love me?
Always feel like I'm proving something
When it's through, it's usually nothing
Why can't I keep my heart in one piece (2x)
You don't deserve my love (2x)

(Verse 1)
You got caught up in the world and I can't blame you
Should've known you was that type of girl and I can't change you
You be stuck on games like it's Playstation
Even when I hit you with the rounds and the haymakers
She either cocainin' or she waist trainin'
All them likes on the Gram and she ain't famous
If you're talking commitment, that ain't the same language
She stayed gettin' rawed, she stayed dangerous
But she got  a model walk like a runway
Her demeanor way sweeter than a Bundt cake
With a cherry on top like a Sundae
Can I make an honest woman out you one day?
But she stay at Magic City on a Monday
Or you'll catch her at a beach trying to sunbathe
When I thought I had her near me, she in another state
She like a DJ, I'm just trying to get some play

(Chorus)
Baby, do you love me?
Always feel like I'm proving something
When it's through, it's usually nothing
Why can't I keep my heart in one piece (2x)
You don't deserve my love (2x)
