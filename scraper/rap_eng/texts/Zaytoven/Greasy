[Intro]
Shouts out to zone 6
East Atlanta stand up
Shouts out to the homey Coach-K

[Verse 1]
I’m in the ATL & I’m hot as hell with no AC
Got more green than AC, I spend 1-50 on my AP
I’m a asshole, kinda arrogant
An Aquarius, no Aries
Got a 1000 P’s of Asparagus
And it’s just touched from AZ
You fuck niggas don’t know me
Be accurate when you compare me
Got a AR & a AK & I’ll turn yo' ass to swiss cheese
Move smooth like a OG, give it to 'em when I go from A to B
Watching out for APD
Cause the S.W.A.T.S been hot all goddamn week
Flashback, quantum leap
2003 and I’m in my V
Go back '99, puttin' Daytons on my Caprice
Fast forward, present time
Coming down the street in a Bentley
My pistol’s my assistant
I’ll shoot yo' ass from a distance

[Chorus]
Greasy, greasy
Don’t bring no knife to no gun fight because they greasy
Don’t buy no dope in East Atlanta cause that greasy
These niggas thirsty for that check, I swear they greasy
Young niggas greasy, OGs they greasy
West side, east side, north side, south side I swear they greasy
These niggas greasy, these bitches greasy
Young niggas thirsty for the check, I swear they greasy

[Verse 2]
Gucci Mane rock so much jewelry
That the niggas stand in and still feel worried
Better walk the yellow brick road
And ask the Wizard can you get some courage
Buy a brick and it don’t do shit
Don’t quit nigga, don’t get discouraged
Real speak, he keep talkin' shit
All of the niggas in yo clique get tortured
I’m a millionaire but I bought a V
Smoked it all with my bottom bitch
10 golds on my top grill, 10 golds on the bottom bitch
Actin' like you bougie
What you're Hillary Rodham bitch?
With them ol' last red bottoms
She blew a kiss, I didn’t acknowledge it
Think I need me a college chick
Good brain with that knowledge shit
Put her up on money
Switch out the bitch closet quick
Charger with a body kit
Cat suit her body bitch
Got free bricks, I got free weed
So you suck my dick you get benefits

[Chorus]
Greasy, greasy
Don’t bring no knife to no gun fight because they greasy
Don’t buy no dope in East Atlanta cause that greasy
These niggas thirsty for that check, I swear they greasy
Young niggas greasy, OGs they greasy
West side, east side, north side, south side I swear they greasy
These niggas greasy, these bitches greasy
Young niggas thirsty for the check, I swear they greasy
