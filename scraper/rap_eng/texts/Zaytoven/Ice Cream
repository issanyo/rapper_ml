[Pre-Hook]
Get it in, I made plays in every state
Countin' benjamins, I'ma always have that cake
They gon' let me in cause they know the boy get paid
Leave no evidence, too many niggas throwin' shades

[Hook]
Ice cream, ice cream
Made let them bitches melt like
Ice cream, ice cream
I can scoop 'em by myself
Ice cream, ice cream
I'ma put it in her cone
Ice cream, ice cream
Don't know when I'm goin' home

[Verse 1]
Ice in that duffle
Had to turn up for the dollar
Nigga worked that muscle
Most my niggas trap scholars
No I don't trust you
Hit my line and I might holler
Guaranteed I bust her
Once I hit her with that follow
Bitch it K Wavy season
Made a hundred for no reason
I'm in every region
Pulllin' up a chair, I'm eatin'
Shawty I tell my mama
She the reason why I'm breathin'
Ain't no other option
I'ma get it every season

[Hook]
Ice cream, ice cream
Made let them bitches melt like
Ice cream, ice cream
I can scoop 'em by myself
Ice cream, ice cream
I'ma put it in her cone
Ice cream, ice cream
Don't know when I'm goin' home

[Verse 2]
Fuck these niggas
You gon' pay me for my time
I don't trust these niggas
Boy ain't raised up like my kind
I'm so legendary
I ain't claimin' what's not mine
She not ordinary
Cause she gon' do the whole line
You get yours and I get mine
I kill 'em every time
Catchin' flights every time
Make her night every time
High as kites every time
I'm alright every time
It's on sight every time
Fuck her right every time

[Pre-Hook]
Get it in, I made plays in every state
Countin' benjamins, I'ma always have that cake
They gon' let me in cause they know the boy get paid
Leave no evidence, too many niggas throwin' shades

[Hook]
Ice cream, ice cream
Made let them bitches melt like
Ice cream, ice cream
I can scoop 'em by myself
Ice cream, ice cream
I'ma put it in her cone
Ice cream, ice cream
Don't know when I'm goin' home

[Pre-Hook]
Get it in, I made plays in every state
Countin' benjamins, I'ma always have that cake
They gon' let me in cause they know the boy get paid
Leave no evidence, too many niggas throwin' shades

[Bridge]
Ice, ice-ice-ice, ice-ice-ice
Ice cream, ice cream

[Hook]
Ice cream, ice cream
Made let them bitches melt like
Ice cream, ice cream
I can scoop 'em by myself
Ice cream, ice cream
I'ma put it in her cone
Ice cream, ice cream
Don't know when I'm goin' home
