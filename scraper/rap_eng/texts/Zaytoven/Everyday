[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane a bachelor, bitch
So don't get too attached to this
We balling on these haters
And these niggas missing practices
My top, I just subtracted it
The life we live ain't average
Me and trouble smoking Cali bitch
We back to back, no marriages

[Verse 2: Trouble]
And I'm pouring Hen, dog
Balling on a daily basis
Duct Tape and Brick Squad
Put that in these haters faces
They ain't pouring Activis
You niggas can't compare to this
Swerving in each lane
No question I'm smashing shit

[Bridge: Gucci Mane]
It's Big Gucci you ain't got to gas me
I'm a predicate, you ain't got to ask me
I'm on a whole nother level than you other guys
And like Domino's I deliver pies

[Bridge: Trouble]
And I deliver fries, them hollows and extended clips
And I deliver fires i know SooWoo homies who set trip
Leave you wet like my tip, after hoes get off me
All bout that action, no flexing, niggas be blasting for talk

[Hook: Trouble & Gucci Mane]
I get money like everyday
Really ain't got no time to play
Try to take mine you wanna lay
Fuck me what you wanna say
I get money like everyday
I tote bar like everyday
Put that shit in these haters face
I get money like everyday

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I'm drinking on that mean purp
Blades make the street hurt
Make a bitch dance til her feet hurt
Brick squad and Duct Tape increasing the murder rate
Everybody knows that we got cheap work

[Verse 4: Trouble]
And they got cheap purp, kush, mead and the beans
Not mean but you got to knock on the screen first
Then let the door swing, choppers all he seen first
Sosa posted with the beam, knock you out the screen first

[Bridge: Gucci Mane]
Yeah, I tote them racks with me like everyday
I might leave a trail, all this mail playa
Ballin's got my True Religion look like thighpads
And my crew hands on like an iPad

[Bridge: Trouble]
Ready to touch you in every position, like you're unlocking the code
Don't whip up to me too quickly, get to unlocking that do'
Get to cock backin them 4's, He was never seen no mo'
Me, Gucci, Ali, and Sosa was locked ready to blow

[Hook]
