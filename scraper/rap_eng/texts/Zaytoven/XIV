I was raised
By the lords
In the 80s
Saw a lot of things man
It was crazee
But mainly
It was what I fucking learned
Seize the opportunity
You get a fucking turn
Gotta Keep ya mouth shut
And eyes wide
Keep it moving lord
Or you can get cha tongue tied
Cause these guys
You know
They never play it fair
Even tho we grew together
They don't eeeen care
Its like
Every nigga for himself
Can't even ask ya family
For some fucking help
So That's means
Gotta put ya self on
And keep the snakes
From talking on ya cell phone
Never do ya business
On ya email
Flood the block
With ya work
Like retail
Cause What you sell
Gotta make the fiends nod
Up in this hell
Life is s'pose to be hard
So
Go & do
What you got to do
Who can stop this
If They ain't giving us some food
The Food from wic
It'll Make ya pride sick
This brusing 5th
It can Make sure I get
A first class ticket Upstate
Or even worse
Trip On boat
Up a lake
This Verse is for the real
Not the fake
You can have a chance
Just take it
