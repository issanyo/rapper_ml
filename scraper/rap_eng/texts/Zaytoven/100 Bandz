100 bands, run em up
100 bands, run em up
100 bands, run em up
100 bands, run em up
Just can’t start a new rock
Just can’t start a new Guinea
Just can’t start a new top
Finna run the bands on up
100 bands, run em up
100 bands, run em up
100 bands, run em up
100 bands, run em up
Finna run the bands on up
Bitch I’m finna run the bands up
Finna run the bands on up
Bitch I’m finna run the bands up

[Verse 1]
100 bands, run em up
Finna run a relay
100 bands, run em up
She said press replay
So I threw them bands up
Started flying in the air
Got lean everywhere
Got loud in the air
Run em up Zay
Run em up Zay
I see them niggas watching
We gone run em up anyway
Call up the plug
Sell a little drugs
Fucking with some bitches
She say I love me a thug
Run them bands, run them bands, run them bands on up
Everything I drive is a must
Every bitch I fuck is a blush
Nigga you ain’t fucking with us
Private codeine, no [?]
H-Town, nigga what you say
Hundred bands on me, I ain’t playing
