Dollars and sense
Those who bout spent
Saying ours been fixed
Should just throw fits
Since the towels been sent
Living my DRREAMS
At you cowards expense
Fuck your opinion, still on my penis
To whom it concern sincerely yours PS
Broke off they locks
Man I feel like Houdini
Fly rugs underneath me
Like I have a genie
So Gandolfini PLEASE no more photos

Cuz Lord knows
Been planted on top for so long
Got me thinking bout cornrows
R.I.P., sorry

Make folks think I'm Commie
Fucked off a comment

Used to say don't quit your day job
Now we bout to take off
I hope you ain't take off
Cake like a bake off

Can't break at this speed
So I don't plan on stopping
Hoes what I hop in

From gramming to Grammys
