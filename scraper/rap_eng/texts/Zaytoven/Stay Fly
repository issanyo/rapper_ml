"Ball and stay fly", that's the motto that I live by
Pissy jewelry leave your main bitch with the pinkeye
"Ball and stay fly", that's the motto that I live by
Pissy jewelry leave your main bitch with the pinkeye
"Ball and stay fly", "ball and", "ball and stay fly"
Pissy jewelry sick, leave your main bitch with the pinkeye
"Ball and stay fly", "ball and", "ball and stay fly"
Pissy jewelry sick, leave your main bitch with the pinkeye

[Verse 1]
Ball and stay fly, dog, 'cause I'm getting money
Serving the ATL and I'm still counting hundreds
Calamari pasta, chilling with my partners
745 trunk, all got them whoppers
Haters try and stop us, but they can't block us
Shooting free throws like I play for the Rockets
Diamonds in my chain, diamonds falling out my pocket
Nigga talking bricks? Aye! Coming by the boxes
Stack a million dollars, nigga, living for the drought, bitch
Kobe Bryant the ticket 'cause a nigga trying to get it
Who got a new house with eight digits
'72 donk and your bitch really dig it

[Hook]
"Ball and stay fly", that's the motto that I live by
Pissy jewelry leave your main bitch with the pinkeye
"Ball and stay fly", that's the motto that I live by
Pissy jewelry leave your main bitch with the pinkeye

Pissy jewelry sick, leave your main bitch with the pinkeye
"Ball and stay fly", "ball and", "ball and stay fly"
Pissy jewelry sick, leave your main bitch with the pinkeye

[Verse 2]
You see me swagging around this bitch 'cause Juice is the brick man
Got fifty chickens stuffed in the black Dodge Caravan
Coming across the border, niggas trying to order
I ain't even tripping, got a hundred in the water
Or should I say the air, mane? Shit ain't even fair, mane
Stupid high taxing 'cause the Juice don't care, mane
32 inches sitting in the air, mane
Stupid, stupid money, the shit ain't even funny
Keep them rubber bands 'cause it all came in hundreds
Red monkey on my ass, shit cost money
Three racks, one pound? Homie, that's nothing
750iL loaded on Asantis

"Ball and stay fly", that's the motto that I live by
Pissy jewelry leave your main bitch with the pinkeye
"Ball and stay fly", that's the motto that I live by
Pissy jewelry leave your main bitch with the pinkeye
"Ball and stay fly", "ball and", "ball and stay fly"
Pissy jewelry sick, leave your main bitch with the pinkeye

[Verse 3]
Nigga, my chain heavy, you can weigh it on the scale
And I guarantee same pounds as a whale
'08 cross, I'll attract a boutelle
And that piece that was brought by fishscale
Ocean near diamonds, white lights, seashells
European shop, eating oysters and some snails
Stingray shoes, like I could stack each pair
Croc and them linen, what I'm rocking this year
I'm Swagger Right Shawty, so you know I'm balling
'07 Avalanche, every screen falling
Candy paint flicking, flexing on them sixes
Your hoe wanted Juice's dreams, so she got one ticket
