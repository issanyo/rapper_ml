[Hook- Gucci Mane]
What up?
I got so much money, pull up
Barber drop Ferrari yesterday is time to mount up
Count up, think its time to do a cook up
Hook up, you know my money doing push ups
What up?
I got so much money, pull up
Barber drop Ferrari yesterday is time to mount up
Count up, think its time to do a cook up
Hook up, you know my money doing push ups

[Verse 1-Gucci Mane]
Driving real fast of the Ferrari lot
Got the bitch tryna count all the cars we got
On the gas pedal, I don't hardly stop
And stop the show like a bitch in a halter top
No shade, just harder rocks
Purple drink in my soda pop
Police looking for me now, cause they saying Gucci Mane just killed the fucking parking lot
Afterparties in Canada
Drop SPYDER, a tarantula
My money got its own manager
I should walk around with a camera
Make visions move
Sellin inner 2's
Sell bricks while a nigga get interviewed
Don't intrude on my music dude
I got a bitch sucking dick through the inter[?]
I was bred to ball, I was born to die
I'm too drunk to drive and too high to fly
Before you count to 1-2-3, you see that .45
I'm the living truth, I don't never lie
Made the trap jump, made the track cry
Never let a bad bitch pass me by
Don't ask me why, but I'm too live

Hook up, you know my money doing push ups
What up?
I got so much money, pull up
Barber drop Ferrari yesterday is time to mount up
Count up, think its time to do a cook up

[Verse 2-Slim Dunkin]
See the diamonds and jewelry and the bitches hitting swishers
In the Rari, I'm sorry, the coupe push button, Atari
Shrimp and Calamari, pocket full of lettuce
No crouton
Girlfriend tripping, I buy a new one
Gucci needs some new ones, nigga I don't do ones
In the mall shopping like a nigga using coupons
Swag so venom, like your dressed in Docker's Denim
All these cars, think I rent um
100,000, can't tint em
My shooters for certain
Them boys be plotting and lurking
Try all that cursing in person
I have them hearses with verses
I talk and I listen
Yellow diamonds they pissing
I be hitting and dishing
And you be tricking, magician
Dunk!

[Verse 3-V-Nasty]
Its me bitches
Ms. V, bitches
Nasty if you ask me, your brother wanna hit this
I'm where the cash be
I'm bout my business
Come with the chopper, knock his head off the hinges
I'm with that shit, cause I bring that fucking drama
Leave um in the hospital, bitch you're in trauma
What ya hollin'? I'm hotter than Obama?
Cause every time I hit the mic I eat it up, Osama
Got the fucking choppers, baby I rap
Yeah you know I'm aiming at that bitch with the Mac
I gotta get the stacks
Leave her line flat
Aiming at that bitch, red beam at the cap
