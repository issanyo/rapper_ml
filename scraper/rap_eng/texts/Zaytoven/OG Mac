Yea I got the 'sama pack, they like OG Mac back
Take yo shit, don't give it back
Plug my gang, I'll give 'em back
Me and Zay is back to back
Gave them hell, now give 'em crack
Yea I got the 'sama pack, they like OG Mac back

[Verse 1]
They like OG Mac back, I'm like when I ever left
Went into the jewelry store, and left out with the whole shelf
If I ever quit this shit I'll prob call my old chef
Turn back to my old self, 5-5-6-6 2-2-3-3 plus 4-5 I keep on myself
Probably not the hardest but the hardest can get shot to death
I work by my damn self cause niggas talk like build-a-bear
Neck look like a build-a-burr, this shit sound like Guwop
Yea free Guwop, pray he free next year
I remember countin' hunnid thousand way before you guessed it Girls say I'm the real deal next, they just want the dick
Try'na rob Imma spray this tec, you can get the clip
OG Mac, I'm fucking back, and still won't run and 'cross the map
