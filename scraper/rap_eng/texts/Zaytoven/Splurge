[Hook: A$AP Ant]
All I wanna do is splurge, all I wanna do is splurge
Cop a foreign whip, (that whip) all I wanna do is splurge
All I wanna do is splurge, all I wanna do is splurge
Buy my moms what she want, all I wanna do is splurge

[Verse 1: Tootie Ro]
All I wanna do is splurge, might cop a bird
Pull up in a foreign whip nigga, his and hers
Think I might cop me a Rollie, think I might smoke a blunt
Matter fact I'm on probation, so nigga can't do what he want
Think I might go do a show, can't even leave the state (damn!)
Might go cop a pound, I'm in love with sellin' that weight
But you know I keep a 50 clip 'round me
Wipe a nigga ass out no Downy
Pussy nigga don't even come 'round me
I was real as fuck when they found me
I was in a church when they found me
I'mma pull up to the city from the county

[Hook]
All I wanna do is splurge, all I wanna do is splurge
Cop a foreign whip, (that whip) all I wanna do is splurge
All I wanna do is splurge, all I wanna do is splurge
Buy my moms what she want, all I wanna do is splurge


[Verse 2: A$AP Ant]
All this money, add it to my credit card
All the [?] me nigga, no Xanny bars
Walk in the club nigga who the fuck is y'all
Run up on me get clipped, Chris Bosh
I ball like I was Chris Bosh
Niggas straight pussy, Chris Bosh
I'm a young boss lookin' like Rick Ross
I'm a young boss lookin' no Rick Ross
I fuck that hoe, better get lost
All white ass, [?] Jack Frost
Bought my niggas what they want, nigga fuck the cost
All red car, look like lip gloss

[Hook]
All I wanna do is splurge, all I wanna do is splurge
Cop a foreign whip, (that whip) all I wanna do is splurge
All I wanna do is splurge, all I wanna do is splurge
Buy my moms what she want, all I wanna do is splurge
