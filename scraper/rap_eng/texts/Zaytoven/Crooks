[Intro]
Haha, 6
6
Money or the fame can't change me
I'ma still be the same me
I'll let my own mama fuckin' hang me

[Chorus]
Write it in the books, I'm a crook, tell by the look
Got these niggas shook, I'm a vet and you steady rook
Posted on the scene, sippin' lean, that promethazine
Sippin' on codeine, play with Jesus 'fore you play with me
All black tee 'til I see my first hundred G's
I don't need designer 'cause none of that shit ain't makin' me
Seven six twos, nigga know I got that K with me
If I call Kojack, nigga know that boy gon' spray for me, baow

[Verse 1]
Boy I got the game in a headlock
Had to hide in the hole 'cause the feds saw it
Niggas sleepin' on Lil 6 like a bed out
Good connection on your block like it's hotspot
Pull up drop top, pop opps with a big top
We got big Glocks, I might dab, I don't milly rock
I want a hundred bands, nigga sleepy off a hundred xans
Molly look like sand, rock and roll off a fuckin' bag
Zay he on the beat and you know he got that heat for me
Slidin' in the jit, it's a stolo so don't ride with me
Guns cold dope, ridin' with a hundred felonies
Stretch said free my brothers out the fuckin' penitentiary
This is the real rap, most these rap niggas big cap
He actin' like a bitch, just for that get him bitch slapped
Cruisin' down the street in my stolo
It's a Honda Civic man, 2004
Five percent tint, that shit low low
Anybody die, eeny miny mo
All my extras light but my grandma a zoe
And we do voodoo, chop the head off a goat
Trapper of the year, serve the best in some soap
Niggas out here stealin' and rerockin' the flow
Money or the fame, man that shit can't change me
Before I sell my soul, let my own mama hang me

[Chorus]
Write it in the books, I'm a crook, tell by the look
Got these niggas shook, I'm a vet and you steady rook
Posted on the scene, sippin' lean, that promethazine
Sippin' on codeine, play with Jesus 'fore you play with me
All black tee 'til I see my first hundred G's
I don't need designer 'cause none of that shit ain't makin' me
Seven six twos, nigga know I got that K with me
If I call Kojack, nigga know that boy gon' spray for me, baow

[Verse 2]
Now this verse, I'ma hit 'em with some simple shit
Bust a nigga bubble, I was thuggin' on that pimple shit
Hole in his face like the nigga got some dimples bitch
Wanna trap out with Lil 6, you just better not move your pivot jit
'Cause that mean it's a foul on the play
In the stolen car, I don't need a Wraith
Police get behind me, I'ma do the race
Two-twenty on the dash, no catchin' me today
So basically I'm drivin' in the 'ject
DJ Khaled voice, screamin' we the best
Now I'm all up in her mouth like some Crest
Nutted on her face, I just made a mess
Now her mouth look like she ate some powdered donuts
TD be Lil 6, I don't think you know us
You a killer and a shooter then come show us
It's extortion, niggas scary, he ain't show up
Like a balloon in the air we finna blow up
Hop inside this flat with me, you just might throw up
Took the harder way, I ain't need no cuts
Grandma makin' black is how I got it sewed up
You got lil ice and the Sprite, nigga pour up
You a killer, I'm a killer nigga, so what?
I was just in the county eatin' cold cuts
Beat my pistol charge, now a nigga turned up

[Chorus]
Write it in the books, I'm a crook, tell by the look
Got these niggas shook, I'm a vet and you steady rook
Posted on the scene, sippin' lean, that promethazine
Sippin' on codeine, play with Jesus 'fore you play with me
All black tee 'til I see my first hundred G's
I don't need designer 'cause none of that shit ain't makin' me
Seven six twos, nigga know I got that K with me
If I call Kojack, nigga know that boy gon' spray for me, baow
