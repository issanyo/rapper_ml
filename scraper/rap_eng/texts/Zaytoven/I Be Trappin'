I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
I be moving, I be juuging, I be bussing down them birds
I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
I be moving, I be juuging, I be bussing down them birds
I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
I be moving, I be juuging, I be bussing down them birds
I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
I be moving, I be juuging, I be bussing down them birds

[Verse]
Trapping is a must, I be serving all the time
Man, I'm posted on the 'Crest with the bricks, pills, and pounds
Old-school Chevy, twenty inches off the ground
Blowing on this kush and roll it straight up out the pound
32 ENT, dog, we constantly working
'07 Avalanche, same color as Urkel
Flying down 20 and we all smoking purple
Twerking five phones, we'll call them chirp mobiles
Moving units, dog, that's an everyday hobby
Twenty-thousand dollars for the Juice to go shopping
Fifty-karat bracelet, eighty-karat chain
Spending big guap 'cause money ain't a thing
Got me moving, I be juuging, I be bussing niggas' heads
With this A1 recipe, got me all this bread
I'ma stay ten toes and try to duck the Feds
Young Juiceman, bitch, and I ain't never scared

[Hook]
I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
I be moving, I be juuging, I be bussing down them birds
I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
I be moving, I be juuging, I be bussing down them birds
I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
I be moving, I be juuging, I be bussing down them birds
I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
I be moving, I be juuging, I be bussing down them birds

[Verse 2]
Big shit popping, little shit stopping
The track plus my vocals got your head bobbing
Linen suits and Prada is what the Juice rocking
Multicolored diamonds got your bitch eye popping
Chain swing shawty, got your hoe arch-hopping
I need a new car, so on my car lot bopping
Shut down the mall when I go shopping
Hundred thousand nights and sixty of it profit
'Lac same color Candler Road Red Lobster
Eating calamari swordfish with the mobsters
Lending out money like I am a loan shark
Riding in the 645 with the Lowenhart
Chevy Truck Plus, Hummer Truck Plus
745 same color as the bus
There's thirty-six bricks in my dually truck
Rolling up the Barney, counting up bucks

[Hook]
I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
I be moving, I be juuging, I be bussing down them birds
I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
I be moving, I be juuging, I be bussing down them birds
I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
I be moving, I be juuging, I be bussing down them birds
I be trapping, I be trapping, I be working, I be twerking
I be moving, I be juuging, I be bussing down them birds

[Verse 3]
Mountain Dew Monte Carlo sitting on 26's
In the kitchen, dog, and I'm whipping like two chickens
Hustling is a habit, cornbread and cabbage
The brick house times two, dog, I made it happen
Try to jack shit, then the Rugas get to clapping
Country boy, half a brick, so I'm high taxing
Magic City Monday nights, your paper, dog, I'm matching
Glass house jumping like a pissy mattress
Pissy chain, pissy ring, jewelry got a bladder problem
Maserati suicide doors, call that bitch Skywalker
Mexican plug, dog, sending the work across that salty water
Young Juiceman got the gwap running across the border
Five hundred chickens, hell yeah, that's a big order
Big chain, big ring with five top lawyers
Young Juiceman, 32 ENT
Bouldercrest, B.O.U.N.D
