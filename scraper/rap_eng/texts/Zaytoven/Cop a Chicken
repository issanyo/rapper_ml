[Intro]
Ch'yeah
Aye, Young Juice
32 Entertainment, okay
Okay, aye, aye

[Chorus]
Cop a chicken, dog, for the 18
Same number, Peyton Manning for the Colts team
Then I hit your block with that straight drop
Three grams for the 50 will have your block hot
Cop a chicken, dog, for the 18
Same number, Peyton Manning for the Colts team
Then I hit your block with that straight drop
Three grams for the 50 will have your block hot

[Verse 1]
I got a half-a-brick Chevy, million pills Buick
Stacked up chickens, same color as the groupies
Blue colored diamonds, same color as the movies
Rolling up the kushy, don't it taste fruity?
Three gram slabs will keep your trap moving
Doing big numbers like I am shooting a movie
Count big stacks, what I call trap booming
Necklace and bracelet, look like blessed by Rudy
Riding 28's down 20 in a dually
With four bad bitches, chain swinging, how I do it
Peyton Manning numbers got me boosting my endurance
The young traps got my shit steady moving

[Chorus]
Cop a chicken, dog, for the 18
Same number, Peyton Manning for the Colts team
Then I hit your block with that straight drop
Three grams for the 50 will have your block hot
Cop a chicken, dog, for the 18
Same number, Peyton Manning for the Colts team
Then I hit your block with that straight drop
Three grams for the 50 will have your block hot

[Verse 2]
Blue and white Cutlass, same color the Budniks
Glass hour bag, same color as the Hummer
Three bales packed, lock down the whole summer
Fifty bricks a night, got me doing big numbers
Apple Jack Chevy, rubberband the fetty
Trap house NASCAR, call it Andre Petty
Double XL Charger looking like spaghetti
Skally ate its tail and it hopped out my belly
You can't weigh my coke 'cause your scale ain't heavy
You can't wear my chain 'cause your wrist game petty
Take your bitch to Justin's for a shrimp scampi
Stacking up paper, what I call trapping

[Chorus]
Cop a chicken, dog, for the 18
Same number, Peyton Manning for the Colts team
Then I hit your block with that straight drop
Three grams for the 50 will have your block hot
Cop a chicken, dog, for the 18
Same number, Peyton Manning for the Colts team
Then I hit your block with that straight drop
Three grams for the 50 will have your block hot

[Verse 3]
Three grams for 50 would have your block hot
If you ain't doing numbers like that, you need to stop
You still got that woomp, making J's shoot a pop
I'm in the trap with that glass, doing the bunny hop
So when you see my face, you will know it's that one stop shop
Keep booming 'cause this cocaine will never stop
Junior Pablo, yeah, I meet him on the block
A nine and a deuce, I drop it in a Pyrex spot
Doing big numbers and I am the one to blame
Mr. Soda with the fishscale cocaine
Hit it with the wrist so I got a sick game
Young Juiceman, still give out airplanes
Colored yay look like Crayolas, mane
Pasta calamari, living like a mobster, paid
Seven cell phones, got my bitch juuging, mane
Bathing Apes boxed up with them cookies, mane

[Chorus]
Cop a chicken, dog, for the 18
Same number, Peyton Manning for the Colts team
Then I hit your block with that straight drop
Three grams for the 50 will have your block hot
Cop a chicken, dog, for the 18
Same number, Peyton Manning for the Colts team
Then I hit your block with that straight drop
Three grams for the 50 will have your block hot
