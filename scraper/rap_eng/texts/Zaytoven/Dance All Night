Tell all hater to hold my mule because boy when i catch it i'm acting a fool
Feel bad for my teacher when i was in school
But when i turned my life around i opened my eyes and my sight was found
Remixing these scriptures My pastor said I'm a ride with you because I really like your sound
I told him that i got to message it well
I feel like an author with stories to tell
And I'm a keep standing i already fell
Because God is the plug with blessings for sale
Clientele- Turned my haters into clientele
Telling these folks the gates of hell will not prevail
Aiming at demons for telling them tales
In my own lane now I'm making a trail
Feeling like Jonah, I'm straight out that whale
We came a long way just like running from 12
So i can't help but to dance dance dance
I got them angels around me that's why i got wings on my pants pants pants
We are fasho he gone bless us so we thanking God in advance (aye!)

When I think of your goodness and all that he's done for me
I can dance all night (yeah)
I can dance all night (I can dance all night)
I can dance all night (I can dance i can dance)
I can dance [x5]
I can dance all night
Woo (Aye Zay), I think I caught the holyghost (Turnup [x3] aye)
I think I caught the holyghost [x3]

Turnt the church up like a rodeo
Put God on the block like a corner store, Aye
