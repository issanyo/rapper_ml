[Intro: Trey Songz]
(Zaytoven)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Trigga
Hunnid bags
I just out here lookin' for a freak-freak, freak
Freak-freak, freak
Hunnid bags when I'm walkin' out the mall
Hunnid bags when I'm walkin' out the mall, yeah
She said, "Daddy, can you show me how to ball?"
Yeah

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Hunnid bags when I'm walkin' out the mall, yeah
She said, "Daddy, can you show me how to ball?"
She gon' give me gooshy gooshy in my flipflops
Your bitch on my arm like a wristwatch
Four Seasons, one pitstop
Throat leakin' on drip drop
Tell your nig', say aight, pull them panties to the side
To the left, to the right, show you right
That was tight, yeah, I like, do that shit I like
Yeah, I like, do that shit I like

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Tory
And I can make it drippy as you like (Drip, drip)
Got this way of doin' what'chu like (Skrrt)
Pull up outside, yeah, I might
Love it when you suck it, lowkey, like it when you bite
You keep doin' good and I'ma do you in Dubai
Fuck it, got a ticket, have her flyin' through the sky
Dials on my wristwatch, it don't tick tock
Sellin' dope to get it, you gon' need a big block
She ain't top ten, she can get the liplock
But she bad enough to stuff it in the Ziploc
Put it on the side, I didn't notice
Know you got that flower bomb like a lotus
You about that action, yeah, I know
But can you get it from the tip top? Head in my flip flops

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Hunnid bags when I'm walkin' out the mall
She said, "Daddy, can you show me how to ball?"
She gon' give me gooshy gooshy in my flipflops
Your bitch on my arm like a wristwatch
Four Seasons, one pitstop
Throat leakin' on drip drop
Tell your nig', say aight, pull them panties to the side
To the left, to the right, show you right
That was tight, yeah, I like, do that shit I like
Yeah, I like, do that shit I like

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Baby, you the realest one afterall
I know what your body sayin', we don't have to talk
Doorman know your name, he don't have to call
Focus on your brain with no Adderall
I be runnin' through your lane like it's basketball
When I knock your body down, don't you waterfall
Take out the noosebleeds, put you where you 'sposed to be
Girl, you been so far away, I just need you close to me
If my name on her thang, everybody know it's me
I can't even roll in peace, everybody know it's me
Jesus piece, Rosary, I could see heavenly
Get'cha bustin' like heavy artillery
And it's music to my ears, auxillary
Put your legs in the air if you feelin' me

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Hunnid bags when I'm walkin' out the mall
She said, "Daddy, can you show me how to ball?"
She gon' give me gooshy gooshy in my flipflops
Your bitch on my arm like a wristwatch
Four Seasons, one pitstop
Throat leakin' on drip drop
Tell your nig', say aight, pull them panties to the side
To the left, to the right, show you right
That was tight, yeah, I like, do that shit I like
Yeah, I like, do that shit I like
