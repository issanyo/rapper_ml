[Hook]
Moment of silence , light some candles
Bitch I'm ballin' and I got the handles
Smoking so much weed I'm fogging up my windows
I'm riding foreign and they got the handles
Imma handle these niggas out the rental
My car be geeking all I did was touch the handle
Leave it up to me to get this money I'm gon' handle it
I got the ball and I got the handles bitch

[Verse 1]
H.A.N.D.L.E I’m off the B.R.O.W.N B.A.G
Any morning he cannot beat me, and the S
Supercharger versus my M3, yes
I was ready to handle business don't bring problems to the next
And for all the big niggas Imma handle it with Tecs
Squeeze the trigger, hold the handle, we got over on you swindle, come and handle this

[Hook]
Moment of silence, light some candles
Bitch I'm ballin' and I got the handles
Smoking so much weed I'm fogging up my windows
I'm riding foreign and they got the handles
Imma handle these niggas out the rental
My car be geeking all I did was touch the handle
Leave it up to me to get this money I'm gon' handle it
I got the ball and I got the handles bitch

[Verse 2]
Got the ball got the handles got the cars got the weed
Came through flexing she love for me
Glock on me go boom boom boom bitch Bone Thugs be with me
I smoke the best weed bitch the bubbly with me
Ain't no nigga just fucking with me
Came through flexing that's nothing to me
Nigga getting mad that's cuffing to me
This bitch too said she love her some Keef
This bitch too said she love her some me
Then I got mad said she fucking with me
Bitch I´m so baked it's a oven with me
A burger and fries that's McDonalds to me
I'm so glad I brought Rondo with me
I'm so workin' count cash smokin' weed
Then these fuck niggas say they comin' for me
I hope nigga know I got a llama on me
I hope nigga know I got drama on me
Money got your bitch with the doors up now your lucks out cause your bitch she's slobbing on me
She like, "Sosa you nutting on me?"
I'm like couple times too much money on me
Told the bitch she ain't coming with me
You can go anywhere but with me

[Hook]
Moment of silence, light some candles
Bitch I'm ballin' and I got the handles
Smoking so much weed I'm fogging up my windows
I'm riding foreign and they got the handles
Imma handle these niggas out the rental
My car be geeking all I did was touch the handle
Leave it up to me to get this money I'm gon' handle it
I got the ball and I got the handles bitch
