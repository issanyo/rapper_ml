[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-cherries on the top man
B-butterscotch jam
P-put me some nuts in them cups
That's what's up man
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream man

Such a thug boo
I like your truck too
When I get older I'mma come over and fuck you
'Cuz that's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream man man

[Verse]
My ice cream man, my rubber band man
Like to rock a bandana, and, and
He need an antenna
Way they watch him
He cuter than Santana

Ice cream man, make my ice cream quickly
I'mma let it sit, I like my ice cream slippery
Hickory, Dickory, call me Mike Vickory
I'mma bad bitch, woof woof, I'm so thickory
Can I lick your, can I lick your ice cream cone
Do it like E.T. I make that nigga phone home
I really like vanilla, but my favorite color chocolate
Chocolate, chocolate, gargle it and gargle it

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-cherries on the top man
B-butterscotch jam
P-put me some nuts in them cups
That's what's up man
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream man

Such a thug boo
I like your truck too
When I get older I'mma come over and fuck you
'Cuz that's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream man man

[Verse]
My ice cream man, 'cuz I can make him scream
Like a Summer Jam fan. And and he Taliban tan
He fuck with young Nicki, since I came from Band Camp
Ice cream man, make my ice cream quick
They nominate Nick, I like HÃ¤agen-Dazs thick
Just put a lot of nuts, I'mma lick it off the tip
I fuck with real thugs, I'm not a Chippendale chick
Now if you see my man, that's my ice cream man
Cuz I never grow up, I'm just like Peter Pan
Baskin Robins, Turkey Hill, Breyers
That other bitch bologna
So I call her Oscar Meyer

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-cherries on the top man
B-butterscotch jam
P-put me some nuts in them cups
That's what's up man
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream man man

Such a thug boo
I like your truck too
When I get older I'mma come over and fuck you
'Cuz that's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream man
