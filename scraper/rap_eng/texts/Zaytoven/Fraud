[Intro]
Are you high yeah?
Worst way, worst way, worst way
Let's go

[Hook]
Ooh when the sun go down, the stars come out
When the sun go down, the sun go down
Put that pussy on you when the sun go down
Pulled his credit report his credit card came back fraud
V.I.P. in the club the sun is down
Tippin' on em like Mike Jones comin' down
Put that make up on that boy homie the clown
Pulled his credit report his credit card came back fraud

[Verse]
I'm a big dog, baby I'm a boss
All my female dogs I wanna hear you bark
Do you like em from Atlanta, like em from New York?
If he don't smoke Oakland, Cali we with you Too Short
That nigga squarer than a box of Newport Shorts
Close my eyes let down my hair cuz life too short
I'm thick the worst way, call me fine, take me to court
I ball like Zay on Wednesday when he run full court

[Pre-Hook]
You got that D, I want that full court press!
If you wanna see me throw it back, mention this!
I'm a Mac, just like my lipstick!
Gimme them Santana Juelz, no Dipset!

[Hook]
Ooh when the sun go down, the stars come out
When the sun go down, the sun go down
Put that pussy on you when the sun go down
Pulled his credit report his credit card came back fraud
V.I.P. in the club the sun is down
Tippin' on em like Mike Jones comin' down
Put that make up on that boy homie the clown
Pulled his credit report his credit card came back fraud
