[Intro]
I don't know what y'all been told
Shawty Lo back on the map
Whats up, whats happening
Yeah, I'm from the Westside, the best side
Motherfuckers need to stop lyin'

[Hook]
Streetz, understand, understood
Streetz, its a man in every hood
Streetz, yell I wish a nigga would
Streetz, I can teach you how to jug
Streetz

[Verse:1]
Don't look surprised they want the old me
Monkey off my back banana clip that nigga tried me
X pills, lean a lil green and the molly
Niggas stealing swag, there's only one Shawty
Damn, cuz I dunn dunn it all
Ballin like a wizard
Yea they call me John Wall
Bricks in the house
Keep the money in the wall
Good girl, church girl
Imma fuck em all, bitches
You ain't ride foreign, you ain't ride nothin'
In a two seater, me and my weapon
Just us three
Me, Smith & Wesson
Try Shawty Lo, you better count yo blessings

[Hook]

[Verse:2]
The J's lined up
Wrapped around the corner like a B concert, Beyonce
And I don't fuck with brown nigga
All white work
32 5 same color t-shirt
Damn, nobody make a move
Nobody get hurt
Shawty got goons
They'll put you in the dirt
Talk is cheap
Been doing it since birth
Nigga thinking its a game
It's a gift and a curse

[Bridge]
I don't know what y'all been told
Shawty Lo back on the map
Whats up, whats happening
Yeah, I'm from the Westside, the best side
Motherfuckers need to stop lyin'

[Hook]
