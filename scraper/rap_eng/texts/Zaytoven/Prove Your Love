(Chorus)
Everything I did, I did, I did it for us
We have been through so much
Never did I mean you had to prove your love
Not to me, not to anybody

(Verse 1)
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, nor make you cry
You're better off when you're not with me, now you can fly high
One thing fasho might be the issue
Nobody really wanna see me with you
Real late at night they hold a pillow
Wishing they could be the one dreaming with you
Wishing they could be the one eating with you
I knew I could trust you, that eased my mental
I like how you moved, real clean and simple
But we gotta move on, I'ma keep the memory


(Chorus)
Everything I did, I did, I did it for us
We have been through so much
Never did I mean you had to prove your love
Not to me, not to anybody

(Verse 2)
She said prove your love to me, prove your love to me, prove your love
Prove your love to me cuz I do not believe. You know what?
I should up and leave cuz you ain't got my needs. Need you for what?
You ain't nothing to me. Make it up to me when you grow up
This ain't what we want no mo'
My policy stay open do'
To let you go, I'm smoking dope
But I had to let us grow

(Chorus)
Everything I did, I did, I did it for us
We have been through so much
Never did I mean you had to prove your love
Not to me, not to anybody
