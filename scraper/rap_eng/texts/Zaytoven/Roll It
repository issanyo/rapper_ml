[Verse 1]
I keep it 100
We fucked she ain't get 1 hundred
Pulled up like a number 1 stunna
'68 road-runner, runner road
Deuces Forgio'
Four deuce Charger
Two thousand whole
I'mma scrape the bowl
Trying to stretch it to get a whole 'nother whole
Bond money ain't gotta worry about a hole
In another county
On the run bounty hunters trying to hound me
They wish they woulda, coulda, had found me
I'm at Miami nigga at the fountain
With a pretty bitch she tired of counting
Broke ass niggas should be tired of lounging
Flow colder than an Appalachian mountain
In the winter time
I'm a dog came from a very very rare kennel line
You niggas ain't no friend of mine
It was Ferragamo and Marciano
Heavy on the pasta
I'm a dope locker
I'm a street nigga with a baby chopper
Get money motherfucker and my poppa
Be a street nigga hang with the robbers
In Miami getting real cash
These niggas talk it I just have it

[Hook]
Tell 'em to roll it, roll it, roll it
Roll it, roll it, roll it
Roll it, roll it, roll it
Roll it, roll it, roll it
Roll it, roll it, roll it

Drank we pour it, pour it, pour it
Pour it, pour it, pour it
Pour it, pour it, pour it
Pour it, pour it, pour it
Pour it, pour it, pour it

Bitch you know it, know it, know it
Know it, know it, know it
Know it, know it, know it
Know it, know it, know it
Know it, know it, know it

Hit the club throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw it, throw it, throw it
Throw it, throw it, throw it

[Verse 2]

I'm talking 'mills
Never missed a meal
Rims wind-mill
Million-dollar deal
Deal for a 'mill
This shit real
Smoking real kush
Kush vacuum sealed
Pop a whole seal
Cause I love the feel
Yeah its crystal clear
Crystal clear it is
Big gun with me that can kill deer
Tell Tarentino that I can kill Bill
Came in throwing it I'm still here
Rest in peace to my nigga still live
Rims very ill
Offset the whips
Penthouse to live
Live in penthouse
In a bitch's mouth
Stash it in the house
Trying to vent it out, rent it out
Rental cars they tinted out
Get 'em in, get 'em out
Get 'em out, when they in
Fly nigga, baby I need a Benz
Maybe a McLaren
Got these bitches starin'
Told my nigga Zay I'mma buy my Rolly with so much clarity
Bitch I'm getting so much money god damn I ain't even caring
