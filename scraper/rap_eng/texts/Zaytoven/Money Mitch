Yeah, I'm the lover, yeah, do what I want(yeah)
Don't cop from that nigga right there 'cause he is a undie
Yeah 'member they ain't love me, now these girls wanna hug me
Only said that 'cause their boyfriends listenin' but these girls wanna fuck me
Yeah, got the rari, saw the Wraith, run it
Run it, run it, run it, run it, yeah
Now I'm on top of the game I remember I was nothing
If I talk to your girl, man I swear you lucky
Ooh, swim in it, ooh, let me touch it
Turn around girl, let me bust it
Running back, running back, rush it
Yeah, in Atlanta, like I'm TJ Duckett
Dior suit, take the arm and I cuff it
Trust no one for nothing, run up and they bust it
Take xans 'til I stumble, full bars now I punt 'em
Look she brung her friends they wanna tumble
Talk to mines in the huddle
All my niggas some savages
You could leave 'em in the jungle
You could leave 'em in the desert
They some dogs need a muzzle
Baby girl turn around
I do not wanna cuddle
Damn you wet like a puddle
Said you wet like a puddle
And Iâ€™m feeling myself
On a molly and an edible
Now your life is ahead of you
No one is ahead of you

[Verse 2]
Got a white bitch her name Connie
Slide in the lamb like a Johnny

Lil Uzi don't move with no twenties
Funny thing is you really don't move with money
You still move with them tens and them fives
You still move with those nickels and dimes
You took that girl to um meet your mom
