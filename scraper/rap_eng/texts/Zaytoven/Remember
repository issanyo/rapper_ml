Metro Boomin want some more -

[Hook]
Use to pull up on the block and cause some motion
My brother use to push that white just like some lotion
We finally made feel like we just crossed the ocean
Do you remember
Growing up in those streets
I ain't even goin flex I still remember
I ain't even goin flex I still remember

[Verse]
No i'm not flexing
We taking off like a jet
Got cleaned off like a dentist
Been a long day
Made here no sweat
So sweet like kool-aid
Talking to God
Giving help to my family
Sometimes they can't understand it
Why you hating
I climb a mountain[?]
They faking

[Hook]
Pull up with a car motion
My brother use to put it like some lotion
We finally made like we crossed the ocean
I'm telling you that we remember
When we try hard we get tired[?]
I ain't flexing nothing[?]
