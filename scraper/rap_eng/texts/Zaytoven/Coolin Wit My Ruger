[Intro]
Rock and roll with this shit
Niggas know every day I got my pole in this shit, nigga
And he know I got my pole in this shit nigga
Nigga run up on Lil 6, I take his soul in this bitch

[Verse]
Peek-a-boo, pop up like Halloween
She like my sausage, like my Jimmy Dean
And yeah, I be sleep as hell off lean
And yeah, I be sippin' on codeine, ayy
Hell yeah, I'm a Robin Louis fiend, ayy
Hell yeah, I'ma beat it, Billie Jean, ayy
Hell yeah, boy my auntie was a fiend
I'll serve her when it comes to dope or green nigga
Serve my grandma when it comes down to that benji
Niggas bitches, get that money and act stingy
Knock knock, who at the door? oh that Whitney
Who the fuck that is? Paul, he want a fifty?
I'm breakin' in your house through the chimney
My father popped, they think that I got children
Don't want no kids, I'm tryna get a million
He blend in with sticks, that lil boy a chameleon
When I fuck her, got her feet up to the ceiling
And if we fuck, bitch that's a friendly
I'm dippin' and I dab through that water
Just fucked your ho, and I fucked your daughter
I'm a real nigga, first and fourth quarter, ayy
TDB, we some reall ass extorters
Don't want no kids, lil bitch I abort you, ayy
Play with the gang, lil bitch and it's torture nigga, 6
Tie your fingers off, feed you to my piranhas
Trap nigga, I'll trap in my pajamas
Don't get killed tryna come between my commas
Stolen car, all black, it's a Honda
Stolen car, all black, it's a Cat, ayy
Young nigga got them racks racks racks, ayy
When I'm in the booth I be spittin' facts, ayy
Lay a pinky on Lil 6, you get whacked, ayy
Lay a pinky on Lil 6 and you offed
You know the memo boy, I never wanted to talk
Just like trick or treat, pop up at your house
Boy I'm creepin' for it, pop up like a mouse
Boy you know I got them ounces in the pouch
You ain't a plug if you never saw a drought
Feds hit, got them bricks in the couch
Nigga dissin' me, he just want some clout nigga
Big dog, you a small ass poodle
On the block, remember eatin' ramen noodles
I just snatched a chain, now Lil 6 a jeweler
It's hot outside but I'm coolin' with my Ruger

[Chorus]
Coolin' with my Ruger
They know Lil 6 the shooter nigga
Coolin' with my Ruger
They know Lil 6 the shooter nigga
Coolin' with my Ruger
They know Lil 6 the shooter nigga
Coolin' with my Ruger
They know Lil 6 the shooter nigga
