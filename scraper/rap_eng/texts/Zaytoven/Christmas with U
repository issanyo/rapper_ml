[Intro]
Zaytoven
Oh what a joyous time, all the bells are ringin' (Ring ring ring, ring ring ring)
What a wonderful time, all the teens are singin' (sing sing sing, sing sing sing)
Ooh, look at all the bright lights, you see them blingin' (Bling bling bling, bling bling bling)
Ooh, I pray that girl over there is a true meaning

[Chorus]
We can do what you wanna when you come over
Girl, I made up my mind, I don't want no other
This year is all about you, baby (it's all about you, girl)
We can go to your mama's or she can come over
Or we can stay at home, it doesn't matter
But I know I'm spendin' Christmas with you, baby (Yeah yeah, I know)

[Verse 1]
Ooh, what a blessing
Lord, she a blessing (Yeah)
Didn't really know what I was missin' (Yeah)
'Til you had to walk up in lil' mama's kitchen (Yeah)
To add a little spice to the fixings (Yeah)
Mmh, I thought I had everything (Everything)
But apparently I had everything (Everything)
Never had no one to help to fly the plane (Fly the plane)
The one that would be oh so proud to wear the ring
I put it on her (Blessings)
I'm tellin' you, I put this on God (What a blessing)
Never would I disappoint you (She a blessing)
I'ma treat her like the star she is, oh

[Chorus]
We can do what you wanna when you come over
Girl, I made up my mind, I don't want no other
This year is all about you, baby (it's all about you, girl)
We can go to your mama's or she can come over
Or we can stay at home, it doesn't matter
But I know I'm spendin' Christmas with you, baby (Yeah yeah, I know)

[Verse 2]
Put my mama on four ankles (Ankles)
Big bounty for my girl to say thank you (Thank you)
Them two I call my angels (Angels)
Mama a prover so I gotta keep her
'Bout her own bag, I don't have to teach her (Teach her)
She keep four phones if I gotta reach her
Ooh, Christmas Day, she said to me (Yeah yeah)
You ain't never ever gonna be in need (Need)
I'ma do whatever fundamentally (Yeah)
Bless you with every possibility (Oh)
I'll never be your obstacle (Obstacle)
I'm just gon' make you more powerful (Powerful)
Be your real, just like the Bible says

[Chorus]
We can do what you wanna when you come over
Girl, I made up my mind, I don't want no other (I don't want no other)
This year is all about you, baby (it's all about you, girl)
We can go to your mama's or she can come over
Or we can stay at home, it doesn't matter (It doesn't matter)
