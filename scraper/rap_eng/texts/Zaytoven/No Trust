[Intro]
I can't trust a nigga
I can't trust a nigga
I can't trust a nigga
I can't trust a nigga

[Verse 1]
Came up in the trenches with the killers and the dealers
Repping my block like fuck them other niggas
I played outside, this was way before some wifi
Me and Ju rehearsing with the dude in the drive-by
Can't trust these niggas, gotta watch 'em with your side eye
Trust a bitch and end up getting set up by a side guy
The game left me traumatized, I'm sleeping with a chopper
The streets will either turn you to a bitch or a monster
Used to risk my neck, so I froze that bitch
Name any drug, I done sold that shit
Boy just be rapping, you ain't drove that whip
Kids see me in the hood like 'what kinda car is this?'
200 on the dash in my whip nigga
Growing up I just wanted to be a rich nigga
I bet my middle school principal, a pissed nigga
Said I wouldn't be gon' shit but I'm the shit nigga

[Hook]
I can't trust a nigga far as I can throw 'em
I won't sell a nigga shit if I don't know 'em
I can't trust a nigga far as I can throw 'em
The streets mine, they be like 'that nigga Pay going'
I can't trust a nigga, I can't trust a nigga
I can't trust a nigga, I can't trust a nigga
I can't trust a nigga, most ain't living right
And if he loyal, gon' 'head and drop his price

[Verse 2]
I got issues, I got issues
I can't leave the house with out my motherfuckin' pistol
They don't feel you, they don't feel you talking all bossy like nobody know the real you
All that extra shit and people still ignore you
Cause you when in the streets forreal, the streets ain't telling for you
When you got the best, I swear the work is selling for you
Crowns on our wrists, me and my bitch looking royal
Shot out to my niggas, they so motherfucking loyal
Bitch it ain't no secret, Fenkel Ave a nigga soil
That don't mean any for you, just cause he gon' ride for you
One weak link in the streets will destroy you
Cut 'em off, cut 'em off
The biggest neck I knew was once my motherfucking dawg
Come in to my hood with that finesse shit
And you'll end up on your back with your chest hit

[Hook]
I can't trust a nigga far as I can throw 'em
I won't sell a nigga shit if I don't know 'em
I can't trust a nigga far as I can throw 'em
The streets mine, they be like 'that nigga Pay going'
I can't trust a nigga, I can't trust a nigga
I can't trust a nigga, I can't trust a nigga
I can't trust a nigga, most ain't living right
And if he loyal, gon' 'head and drop his price
