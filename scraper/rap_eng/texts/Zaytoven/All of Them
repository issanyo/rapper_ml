[Intro]
(Zaytoven)
Street shit, yeah

[Chorus]
All the pretty bitches love drug dealers (drug dealers)
All the pretty bitches love drug dealers (for real, drug dealers)
Mama told her stay away from them drug dealers (damn, ha, yeah)
But she fell in love with a drug dealer (woo)
All the pretty bitches love drug dealers (drug dealers)
All the ratchet bitches love drug dealers
All the savage bitches love drug dealers (haha, yeah)
All the pretty bitches love drug dealers (ayy, who that?)

[Verse 1]
Pull up in somethin' that go real, real fast (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, zoom)
She got mad when I ask that's a real ass (haha, this ain't real)
It's that real glass, smokin' real gas (yeah, yeah)
Don't pull up at the spot unless you spendin' real cash
Turn the box Chevy to a 911 (switch it up)
Hundred thousand, all 20's in the mattress (dope boy)
A half-a-million, all 100's in the attic (trap, trap)
All I see is money, two stacks for these glasses (don't play with me)
I called my bitch lil' bitch RiRi, she say she a savage (yeah)
Put the dick up in her, have her singin' like she Gladys
My young bitch think she Trina, she swear she the baddest (huh)
A good girl can't wait to give a drug dealer, don't panic, yeah

[Chorus]
All the pretty bitches love drug dealers (drug dealers)
All the pretty bitches love drug dealers (for real, drug dealers)
Mama told her stay away from them drug dealers (damn, ha, yeah)
But she fell in love with a drug dealer (woo)
All the pretty bitches love drug dealers (drug dealers)
All the ratchet bitches love drug dealers
All the savage bitches love drug dealers (haha, yeah)
All the pretty bitches love drug dealers

[Bridge]
I'm just a trap nigga (trap)
My son a trap baby (trap, trap)
I'm just a trap nigga (trap)
My son a trap baby (trap, trap)
I'm just a trap nigga (trap)
My son a trap baby (trap)
My girl my trap bitch (trap)
I mean my trap lady (ayy)

[Verse 2]
Runnin' niggas out the game 'cause they out-dated (watch out)
Now they ain't give it to me, yeah, I had to take it (nah, gimme that)
First I got a sack, then ran up a bag (yeah, woo)
Young niggas run the hood, and we won't give it back (yeah)
Mama told her stay away from them drug dealers (drug dealers)
Mama told her stay away from them drug dealers (drug dealers)
Now she out here hidin' dope and holdin' pistols (haha, damn)
Tryna be just like her best friend and her sister (ha, yeah)

[Chorus]
All the pretty bitches love drug dealers (drug dealers)
All the pretty bitches love drug dealers (for real, drug dealers)
Mama told her stay away from them drug dealers (damn, ha, yeah)
But she fell in love with a drug dealer (woo)
All the pretty bitches love drug dealers (drug dealers)
All the ratchet bitches love drug dealers
All the savage bitches love drug dealers (haha, yeah)
All the pretty bitches love drug dealers (ayy, who that?)
