[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
I talked to big bro today
He said let’s go to Medellin
I got a bad ho that snort Ye'
She like to go to Medellin
Medellin, Medellin
Medellin, Medellin
Medellin, Medellin
Medellin, Medellin

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Rest In Peace to Pablo
I want bricks like Pablo
Glizzy I'm so macho
All about this guapo
We got cocaine, straight from Medellin
Why you gotta trap phone
If it don’t ring
Ring, Ring, Ring, Ring, Ring
Need a whole thing
Tryna kill Glizzy, you gonna need a whole team
Young drug lord, trapping, don’t get bored
Fuck a trap house, got a whole trap store
Blood taught me bricks out the back bar
Oups, thank you, Lord, now I need some more

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
You talking to the man in-between
But really I’m the nigga you need to see
Private plane back to DC
Three hours cost me 5 keys
I’m a distributor like the Medellin
Only white bricks around me
Jugg over 5000 keys
I told you, you ain’t seen the shit I seen
Every time the streets ugly, I take flight
Drop the prices on the bricks, I wish I might
Bad bitch with me just to test the white
Two shooters, cooking bricks will cost your life

[Hook]
