[Chorus 1 Lord Twinkletoes]
Skool skool skool yeah
Lets not go back to skool
Skool is over skool kiss our ass'
We won't come back here ever again
Girl lets leave skool in our past

[Verse 1 Lord Twinkletoes]
Pull up in the coupe everyone respects me
Shout out to all the people who respect me
I know some people don't respect me like the other people do
What would I do without you girl your my biggest supporter
Don't know what I would do without you girl
Sexy girls 'round me all the time got to admit not as cute as you

[Chorus 2 Lord Twinkletoes]
Skool skool skool yeah
Lets not go back to skool
Skool is over skool kiss our ass'
We won't come back here ever again
Girl lets leave skool in our past

[Verse 2 Lord Twinkletoes]
Shout out to Migos I respect them
Shout out to Lil Uzi Vert I respect him
Shout out to The Weeknd I respect him
Shout out to Big Sean I respect him
Shout out to Drake I respect him
Shout out to Travis Scott I respect him
They won't go back to skool like I won't
Keep watchin' me whip up the cash from my pockets
I will still be real and famous, yeah
Skool not real (not real)
Skool not famous (not famous)

[Chorus 3 Lord Twinkletoes]
Skool skool skool yeah
Lets not go back to skool
Skool is over skool kiss our ass'
We won't come back here ever again
Girl lets leave skool in our past

[Outro Lord Twinkletoes]
If I ain't making songs
I will be making my girl happy
One more time
If I ain't making songs
I will be making my girl happy
