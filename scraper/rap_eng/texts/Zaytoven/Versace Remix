Oh my god it's Swolo at the Versace store!

[Verse 1: Jay Swolo]
Versace versace I do it big daily but it's a small hobby
Se acabo my nigga, definitive remix I make you look sloppy
Over 9000, like Andre 3000, I'm telling Ms. Jackson i'm sorry
So fresh and so clean and my team is so mean, got the principal calling me
Grades may be droppin', my skill level rising, so no I ain't parking it
You can't get no money, it ain't even funny, there's no Kevin Hart in this
Only degree that I need is up under her arms, I am stank hoe intolerant
Duck Hunt for these niggas subliminal shots, like a hit dog is hollerin'
Versace versace versace versace
I'm late to the party
I'm paying with pennies to hit up Atlanta
Then rainman at Follies
Shout out to the niggas that's rushin to class, give a fuck if I'm tardy
How am I gifted but don't fuck with Santa for calling me naughty
It's a cold world my nigga reply wit go figure then play some monopoly
All gold in my mouth but it's really one tooth, that's a super hyperbole
From the top to the bottom I'm cleaning up nice, and I don't have no flossary
Red on my neck cuz ya girl looked me up with her sexy lip glossary
Shut up when I'm speaking, fix what you leakin' and hear what I'm sayin
Swolo the waterboy powerin up, like what are you sayin?
Don't miss a shot, at the top quite a lot, where the F are you stayin?
Puttin points on the board damn my points overboard, what the F are you playing?
2k13 still ain't sippin no lean but I feel Himalayin
Flier I'm higher than Lizzie McGuire in Pari parlaying
Hate on me now but I promise one day that you'll probably be switching
11:11 - Audition Day so there's no need for wishing
Versace, versace, versace
PGR, yeah we killin everybody, uh
Don't own a shirt, but I bodied
Versace, Versace, Versace
