[Intro: Jessica Dime]
(Zaytoven)
Yeah, it's Dime Piece
What up, Dolph?
You know I had to kill this shit
For the real Queen of Memphis
Yeah
Yeah
I got a lot of shit I got to say
I thought I should preach to em'
Leggo!

[Verse: Jessica Dime]
Don't give a fuck about opinions
Unless you pay me
A maid bitch
Broke bitches can't stand me
I swear they mama shoulda used a Plan B
Run up, hoe!
Queen of Memphis here
I don't compete
Bitch, my mind stay on paper
Like some fucking ink
These bitches broke as fuck
Too concerned 'bout me
I'm glued on these bitches mind
Like a lace front
Ain't shit changed
I'm the same bitch from day 1
Niggas begging everyday
But stunt on IG
Fake ass niggas
Should be on ya ID
Where that money at?
That's where I be
Killing them
Somebody call an IV
I should beat niggas up
When they try to flex
Screenshot ya bank accounts
And they fucking text
Niggas talk like hoes walk thru
And bitches nervous
Oh, your Man Crush Monday
That's my Throwback Thursday
You either getting tricked on
Or you're tricking off
It ain't tricking if you got it
But you niggas don't
The same ones you helped out
When they went broke
Be the same niggas turning
S'posed to be ya folks
Only God can judge with judges
In court every day
Throwing a book at niggas
Making sure they family ate
And these dumb ass hoes fighting over dick
And why they fighting
It's prolly in another bitch
I been a problem
You bitches hustle backwards
Fuck twitter, bitch
Then hollow tips don't @ you
Home banks [?]
Me and Blac Chyna had them bands in a suitcase
Had to switch ya style up, bitch
Cause mine was taken
Had to stop claiming the crown, bitch
Cause you was faking
Bitches rap they whole life
Still ain't got signed
Deal or no deal
I been a boss
You hoes ain't blind
Bitch
