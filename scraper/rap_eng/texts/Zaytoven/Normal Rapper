[Intro]
Zaytoven
Uh, uh, damn, damn, damn, damn
Rich Shoota shit, nigga, you know what the fuck it is
Rich Shoota, hunnid round goon
What's up Zaytoven
Heroin on a spoon
Uh, I'm dope
What's up Zay

[Chorus]
It come we buss out the wrapper, I'm not no normal rapper
I'm an err' day trapper, owe me money, I kidnap ya
I don't do no steppin', but hell yeah, I'm a Kappa
And yes, I keep my weapon 'case I gotta fuckin' wack 'em
Bricks for the low still tax 'em, white or the santan, don't really matter
Fork in the coke batter, don't grab it, swirlin' the water in the pint its a habit
Me and Ayeek smoke cabbage, just pulled up on two bunny rabbits
Yeah, we finna' fuckin' show these bitches that we savage
She fucked a Rich Shoota now the lil bitch braggin'

[Verse]
I'm pressin' to start this bitch, I don't need no keys
I shoot like Stojakovic, my specialty threes
Used to sell QP's, and I just got a call from QC
And I got a plug on the weed for thirteen
Shot my first gun, I was only thirteen
Two sons on the way, I'ma raise two kings
100 brick play, I'ma make the bells sing
And I move like the mob, badda boom, badda bing
And the only time I move when they talkin' 'bout the cream
Young nigga, got rich off the poppy seed
These niggas know they don't want no damn smoke with me
Hunnid round goon, bitch this shit ain't no joke with me
Two Spanish bitches, they on me they throatin' me
They cousin out Cali, them lil niggas grow for me
One Patek, one Rollie, nigga run it up, now they know me
Red diamonds like they got dinner, ravioli
Got pounds got pieces, thunder on Boli
I ball real hard, not Shaq, not Kobe
I ball like Q Da Fool, bitch, you know its one and only
Real recognize real, you look phony
These niggas rappin' like the goon, they tryna clone me

[Chorus]
It come we buss out the wrapper, I'm not no normal rapper
I'm an err' day trapper, owe me money, I kidnap ya
I don't do no steppin', but hell yeah, I'm a Kappa
And yes, I keep my weapon 'case I gotta fuckin' wack 'em
Bricks for the low still tax 'em, white or the santan, don't really matter
Fork in the coke batter, don't grab it, swirlin' the water in the pint its a habit
Me and Ayeek smoke cabbage, just pulled up on two bunny rabbits
Yeah, we finna' fuckin' show these bitches that we savage
She fucked a Rich Shoota now the lil bitch braggin'

[Outro]
It come we buss out the wrapper, I'm not no normal rapper
I'm an err' day trapper, owe me money, I kidnap ya
