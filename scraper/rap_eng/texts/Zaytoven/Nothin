[Intro]
Motherfuckers always tryna figure out why I don't care about nothin', yeah

[Hook]
Yeah, I came from nothin', I grew up with nothin'
Yeah I'm a hustler, made somethin' out of nothin'
Swear that she a bad bitch but that bitch is nothin'
Heh, yeah, aye
Yeah, I came from nothin', I grew up with nothin'
Swear that she a bad bitch but that bitch is nothin'
Yeah I'm a hustler, made somethin' out of nothin'

[Verse 1]
I ain't never gave a bitch a dime
I ain't never gave a bitch time
All these rappers mad at me cause I ain't signed
And I got more money than they CEO
I judge my bitches by who got the best deep throat
I judge by niggas by who never let they gun show
I came up from across the track where niggas starvin' at
Where niggas cross out they own brother and they heartless at
Some fuck niggas that used to sell my mama crack
I flex on that bitch as I cop them coupes back to back
I've been havin' pussies hatin' on me my whole life
That's why I just pulled off with 400 thou worth of ice

[Hook]
Yeah, I came from nothin', I grew up with nothin'
Yeah I'm a hustler, made somethin' out of nothin'
Swear that she a bad bitch but that bitch is nothin'
Heh, yeah, aye
Yeah, I came from nothin', I grew up with nothin'
Swear that she a bad bitch but that bitch is nothin'
Yeah I'm a hustler, made somethin' out of nothin'

[Verse 2]
Went from trappin' to rappin', they can't believe I made it
I pulled this shit off and didn't sign to a major
Got more money than your whole team that's why you bitches hatin'
I mean that shit when I say I'm a rich crack baby
Send them boys up in your spot and leave it vacant
South Memphis nigga down in Florida with the Haitians
Play with me lil nigga, you know my occupation
That bitch swear she bad but she ain't
Only 10% of my cash in the bank
I'm so focused on the money that I don't blink
They told me don't drink and drive, drive and drink
Ridin' southern they go fast, neck full of bling

[Hook]
Yeah, I came from nothin', I grew up with nothin'
Yeah I'm a hustler, made somethin' out of nothin'
Swear that she a bad bitch but that bitch is nothin'
Heh, yeah, aye
Yeah, I came from nothin', I grew up with nothin'
Swear that she a bad bitch but that bitch is nothin'
Yeah I'm a hustler, made somethin' out of nothin'
