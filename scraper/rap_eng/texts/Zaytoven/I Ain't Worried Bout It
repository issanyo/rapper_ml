[Hook: Young Scooter]
Young Scooter run the streets, I know you heard about it
A lot of niggas hate on me but I ain’t worried about it
I put the packs in every hood, I know you heard about it
I know a lot of niggas snitching, I ain’t worried about it
I ain’t worried about it, I ain’t worried about it
I ain’t worried about it, I ain’t worried about it
I took a loss for two mill but I ain’t worried about it
I ain’t got no record deal but I ain’t worried about it

[Verse 1: Ralo]
Ralo got ammo, how the fuck you run this shit
Look who I’m running with, we put the streets on punishment
We locked it down but we ain’t throw away the keys
I ain’t cripping but we balling overseas
Parking the Bentley next to the penitentiary
Mind your business, my folks need a visit
Fuck a deal, we been drug dealing
Made millions, made all of these niggas get in they feelings
I got that puck and I ain’t talking aids
I don’t stand in line for J's, I got a line of J's
Fuck buying them J's, the J's buy 'em for me
Fuck a 9 to 5, come buy a 9 from me

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Tank caught a 22 but he ain’t worried about it
Guwop got a 3 and a half but he ain’t worried about it
These niggas tryna buy a half but I don’t serve nobody
They say when you in the streets then you can’t trust nobody
But I trust [?] so nigga fuck everybody
Look how they set up stoner Rick but he ain’t worried about it
See when you playing with them bricks you can’t trust anybody
They say I look like a lick but I ain’t worried about it
I get your bitch ass killed and never worry bout you
You broke as hell, I’m filthy rich, and I ain’t worried about you
You say you from the streets, never heard about you
Little pussy ass nigga, I ain’t worried about you
Out here my lingo with everybody, me and [?] ain’t worried about you
