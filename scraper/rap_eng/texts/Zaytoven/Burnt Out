[Intro: Quavo]
Hey you remember that young nigga we seen in the hood
Aha, hell yeah
That nigga burnt out
You remember he came out and told me that shit man

[Hook: Quavo]
You turn a dollar to a million
In a trap I look like a chameleon
I don't give a fuck about no nigga feelings
Got the chopper for the victims
Mumma told me to go kill em'
So I'm in an all black, like I'm John Wick
Open up the trunk, it's a brick and a stick
That's a life sentence, quarter mill on my wrist (damn)
That nigga burnt out
Burnt out
That nigga burnt out
On a highway with hundred pounds
That nigga burnt out
Young nigga trap out his Mumma's house
That nigga burnt out
That nigga burnt out
Burnt out
Damn that nigga burnt out

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Twelve got him in interrogation
But he burnt out he ain't singing
They'll give a young nigga a life sentence
If they ever find a fucking banger
He a young nigga still trapping and banging
Walk around twisting his fingers
But he's still in the kitchen and whipping the pot
Watching the dope look like it Kurt Angles
Hit the pot at every angle
In the kitchen and Iâ€™m cookin' Topanga
I don't really fuck with strangers
Never know he could be singing
If you want a hunnid we can arrange it
No refunds so it changes
You can test the dope with your pinky finger
Now he feeling like a Power Ranger

[Hook: Quavo]
You turn a dollar to a million
In a trap I look like a chameleon
I don't give a fuck about no nigga feelings
Got the chopper for the victims
Mumma told me to go kill em'
So I'm in an all black, like I'm John Wick
Open up the trunk, it's a brick and a stick
That's a life sentence, caught a mill on my wrist (damn)
That nigga burnt out
Burnt out
That nigga burnt out
On a highway with hundred pounds
That nigga burnt out
Young nigga trap out his Mumma's house
That nigga burnt out
That nigga burnt out
Burnt out
Damn that nigga burnt out

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
The nigga walking with a dirty stick
Burnt out he looking sick
Robbing, finessing everything in sight
That nigga Debo cause he's taking shit
Young nigga fifteen and he with the shit
His brother just caught a charge for a brick
He sent the little bitch on a trip
To pick up some shit from the Mexicans
Momma preaching like a reverend
He a rookie wanna be a veteran
All he wanted was a necklace
And his trap game be excellence
He like the boot of the Hannah Montana
Young nigga burnt out like I blew out the candles
No ski-mask got a bag but she said fuck the cameras
Walking with a dirty stick long as an antenna

[Hook: Quavo]
You turn a dollar to a million
In a trap I look like a chameleon
I don't give a fuck about no nigga feelings
Got the chopper for the victims
Mumma told me to go kill em'
So I'm in all black, like I'm John Wick
Open up the trunk, it's a brick and a stick
That's a life sentence, caught a mill on my wrist (damn)
That nigga burnt out
Burnt out
That nigga burnt out
On a highway with hundred pounds
That nigga burnt out
Young nigga trap out his Mumma's house
That nigga burnt out
That nigga burnt out
Burnt out
Damn that nigga burnt out
