Coaliton Cartel
It ain't hard to tell

As the Kings of Corruption

Cool with the Police
We Commit a crime it's Nothin'
Any nigga that say otherwise
Gonna get an old Fashion Ruffin'
And Very Often
Put that nigga in a coffin

The Bitches wanna give us hugs
Them Tricks love the mugs
Smokin' Weed
Is part of the creed
Learned only if you read

Verse 3: Huricaine G
Remember Me
The Bitch Bitch drivin' a royce
After my first album dropped
I copped a mill and forced
My Way into the scene
I had the Green
So I joined the team
Ever since I was a young Senorita
Comin' Up in the game
I had a dream
To be the main
Bitch and run the scene
Have all the cream
Ya'll now what I mean
Whut WHut

Hook: Scratched by DJ Premier

Verse 4: Hedrush Napoleon
Hedrush
Smoke the brush
Only nigga to own a trust
Got caps to bust
So you know I must
Be the illest muthafucka alive
I Thrive
On the blood of Bitch ass niggas
Single Figga Niggas
No Doe Niggas
No Game Niggas
Who think they run game
After I finish with 'em
They turn up dead
Wit a bullet in they brain
I'm the same
Nigga you heard on family ties
Only now i gotta a kill record
And a list of Fucking Lives

Verse 5: Tragedy
Criminal Warfare
The Cartel come equipped
Beware
Here comes a scare
Get a taste first
We'll probably pull out ya hair
Maybe give you a dress to wear
That is the flair
The fuckin' warnin'
Stand Back then
And there won't be no mournin'
But act raw
Try to ball
Remember like the 701 Squad
We Takin' it all+
This is your downfall
So get on ya knees and crawl
Act proud
We'll cut off
Your fuckin' balls
Pin 'em to the walls in
You're muthafuckin' crib
Then we'll start cutin' you up
Limb by Limb
Until you are
A bloody mess on the floor
Hang a sign over your door
Do not enter
This is a Coalition Cartel Score
