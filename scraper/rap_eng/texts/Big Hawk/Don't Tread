[Intro]
In the beginning, we were those kids
That played on the dirt fields
But with determenation
We came from the bottom
And rose to the top
We chased and grabbed
Ahold of our dreams
Now we play on the fields
Where the grass is greens
And we can tell by the
Looks on their face
When they find out what the
Dream is we chased
They hate
But we as a team
Have a phrase we say when
Negativity comes our way
Don't tread on this

[Verse 1]
Game took hold like the roots of a tree
Think soccer ain't a sport?
Then why'd NIKE sign me?
Cause I got on my job
And made the game ferocious
I was born with a drive
I got that from no coaches
Big Hawk and Deuce
Spitting truth in the booth
Stop drop and role
I brings down the roof
Got nothing to lose
And everything to prove
Don't change the mood
Cause we done payed our dues
Best to give way
For the USA
Now we're hot
You might think we're a sun ray
In over your heads
Southside, we fed
This is life and I'm grinding
Until I'm dead
Thanks to DJ Screw
This ain't Friday night lights
But I got the infrared
Yeah and you already know
Beggars on the shoes
Big hulk came through

[Hook]
Everybody out your seat
Bob your head to this
Real recognize real
We was bred for this
The dream is real
Don't tread on this
We live the dream
Don't tread on this
Everybody out your seat
Bob your head to this
Real recognize real
We was bred for this
The dream is real
Don't tread on this
We live the dream
Don't tread on this

[Verse 2]
See I'm a just do it like Nike
Spit it so nicely
When I'm done some ain't gon' like me
I'm a try to say it politely
So I might come across a tad bit feisty
Check my resume and see
What I've done
I'm official like the
Check on my AF1
From the slums
Raised off noth'n but crumbs
I don't want none
And look what I've become
Ahuh ahuh I'm a just keep it real
And my brother's ghetto dreams
Will be fulfilled
And on the field
Deuce gonna show his skills
Wheel to wheel for real
And so I feel
My balls are real
So home boy please
Don't tempt me
Or I'll cross you over like the
Great Clint Dempsey
The rhyme is simple so
Please don't tread on this
This is soccer and rap
With a screwed up twist

[Hook]
Everybody out your seat
Bob your head to this
Real recognize real
We was bred for this
The dream is real
Don't tread on this
We live the dream
Don't tread on this
Everybody out your seat
Bob your head to this
Real recognize real
We was bred for this
The dream is real
Don't tread on this
We live the dream
Don't tread on this

[Verse 3]
Don't wake a sleeping giant
Unless you wanna see him pissed
Though I'm quick with my feet
You ain't seen the fist
It'd be a one hitter quitter
Then class dismissed
Better think twice before you
Try and tread on this
Games hard on the street
Cause with no shoes on their feet
Winning satisfies hunger
They don't need to eat
Yeah we came here to learn
But we're starting to teach
Cause we stood in the shadows
Now you can see
Haters wanna hate
But man I'm feeling great
Thanks to soccer
I'm around more ice
Then a hockey skate
More cash than's in a bank
No need for ya'll to rate
I done cut the yard
And threw the trash away
In the south we got the game on lock
More game than a game cock
In Texas we plead block
Straight close up shop
I'm gettin twisted
Steppin on rough
You think we trippin'?
Check the stats yourself

[Hook]
Everybody out your seat
Bob your head to this
Real recognize real
We was bred for this
The dream is real
Don't tread on this
We live the dream
Don't tread on this
Everybody out your seat
Bob your head to this
Real recognize real
We was bred for this
The dream is real
Don't tread on this
We live the dream
Don't tread on this
