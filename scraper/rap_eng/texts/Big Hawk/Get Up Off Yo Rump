[Chorus: Fat Pat]

You gotta get up off yo rump, if you want to make it
You gotta grind, you gotta pump, you gotta make the change
You gotta get up off yo rump, if you want to make it
You gotta grind, you gotta pump, you gotta make some ends

[Verse 1: Fat Pat]

Gotta get up off my rump, I'm in the game, trying, to make it
It's '89 and this shit just started to jump
Young nigga on the corner all night trying to pump
O.G.'s used to tell me, homie: "Watch your back and keep your pistol strapped tightly on ya."
Because it's cold on these corners and these streets
Player hatin' broke bustas always trying to be
And stayin' on feet, keepin' my pockets tight
And niggas been hatin' way before you lied
Sayin' this, and you know this and that
And who's that fool that try to steal Fat Pat?
Breakin' heads in '97 to squash the chatter
On TV shows kickin' with mad hatter
Straight from the streets where you know it don't stop
1200 MLK Dead End block
Glocks stayin' cocked, like it's supposed to be
And jealousy and envy made 'em foes to me
Regulatin' 'em boys, while you hatin', contemplatin'
Come on wit it, big baby bun waitin'
Leavin' you stranded on an island like Gilligan
Wishin' for the SS Mental puttin' one up in your temple should be simple
Sharpen my game like a pencil, and use the hard times as a learnin' utensil

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Kay K]

I got to get it, get it, ain't got no time to be playin' with it
Peep my scheme, it just take a minute
All my years, all my tears. Givin' this game all I got to give stackin' money on the bill
Every word I speak is real, can't be hypocritin' the game
I be somethin' by chrome mean cause I be doin' these kind of things down in Texas
Where you been? Boy it's a war on these city streets of a dope beats and pens
Ain't no kin on the track, makin' yo weave split back, with this weapon I pack
I'm collectin' 'till had and state facts
There's bound to be some tricks hatin', open your eyes to this dead end three niggas runnin' on a corporation
That's why my stacks, have a nigga broke tryna chase 'em
Better save 'em, don't waste 'em, it ain't guaranteed yo ass can replace 'em
And toe-to-toe, any nigga I'mma face 'em

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Big Hawk]

Aww shit, can't quit, gotta get up off my rump
Bump and grind, gotta get mine 'cause it's a must I hump
I pump, my goal is a constant dream. Devising plots and schemes in order to increase my cream
Go hard, dig deep to achieve my purpose
To get my feet up off the ground and start scratchin' the surface
To alleviate the struggles and to hide the pain
In this white man's world I gotta break these chains
Maintain a level head so that I won't fail
To be of my clientel and aboard these damn jail cells
My mail
