[Intro: Big Hawk]
H.A.dub.K, hater proof
Kyle Lee, Robert Earl Davis
This is for you baby
Know what I’m saying

[Verse 1: Big Hawk]
In the turning lane, six CD change
Trunk full of bang like change then I swang
Smoking Mary Jane as I grip wood grain
It’s kinda hard to explain why I’m so off the chain
Still banging screw, riding candy blue
I don’t gang bang so I ride red too
Ever since 92 I’ve been screwed up
Syrup in my cup and that strawberry crush
Sitting on buck or sitting on grey
D to the A it’s the H.A.dub.K
Still to this day I’m still screw head
Even though screw dead I’m still doing what he said
Repping S.U.C repping P.A.T
Repping Mafio and Gata of patn’ me
What screw did for me, was real as can be
That’s why the whole world must know it’s legacy

[Chorus: ]
I’d rather bang screw while I’m on the block riding through my hood
Grey tape in the deck, while I’m sipping drank and smoking good
I’m talking bout that Pat and that S.U.C coming out my trunk
Or maybe E.S.G while I swang and bang to the ocean of funk

I’d rather bang screeew, yeee, know wha I’m saying
Said, I’d rather bang my screeeew, know wha im sayin x2

[Verse 2: Big Cease]
It gotta be slow down if it gone bang in my ride
I was raised in the tex and I rep it with pride
Grey tape in the deck of the slab at all times
RIP to the legend, true king of the south
Who would of thought back in 92
The whole world dripping candy and jamming Screw
I'm sure he knew it cause he started the movement
Slowing down the music now it’s all eyes on Houston
Pistol trolls sliding all the way slow
While I'm buried over gold, while I'm sipping on a 4
Peep the crops fader, make the beat studder
RIP to H.A.dub.K's brother
That’s the Fat P, haters won’t like me
When they see the DVD with Big Hawk and Kyle Lee
Big Cease I represent hater proof
And I done heard it all before but I’d rather bang screw

[Chorus: ]

[Verse 3: Kyle Lee]
I’ma screw head till I D.I.E
And I got ghetto dreams like P.A.T
Do you remember, creeping in my window
Month of September, riding foreign car in the winter
Throwed then a bitch, as the wood wheel twist
Diamonds on my fist, I’m leaning on a switch
Tipping on 4's, got candy on my doors
Diesel on my chest, banks on my toes
Don’t approach hoes, real players get chose
Classy L Vogues on my wide body loads
June 27th, whose next to plex
I’m a south side player from Screwston, Tex
Sitting sideways with the H.A.dub.K
On the highway blowing blueberry haze
Screw in the deck while I hogg the lane
Slow mo music is all I bang

[Chorus: ]
