She will never ask me, Baby who's that bitch?
She will never ask me, Who you going with?
She will never ask me, When will you be back?
She will never ask me, How did you get that lack?
She will never ask me, Where that money come from?
She will never ask me, Why did you run?
She will never ask me, why you got the pen
Cuz I'll slap her in the mouth and say shut up bitch
