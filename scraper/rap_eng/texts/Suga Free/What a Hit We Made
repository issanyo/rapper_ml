[Verse 1: Beta]
It’s just some more of this cold-blooded, unscuffable pimpin’
Untouchable ism, tougher than denim when I run up in ‘em
All on these broads like a cheap suit
I hack into her brain and crash everything down
(Then what?) Then reboot
Yadamean? I’m the million dollar dream
Cash over a batch, see, that’s a common thing
She’s so vulnerable in the presence of the honorable
My game’s phenomenal, no need for an audible
I’m colder than the Abominable Snowman with a popsicle
Just follow my voice, I can guide you through any obstacle
Anything’s possible when you’re dealing with me
You better believe I’m ahead of my breed by many degrees
My profile is exquisite, for years they tried to prohibit
But kept comin’ up short like a midget
When you’re in the Hall of Game, come and visit my exhibit
And you too be one of few to be schooled, you dig it?

[Verse 2: Suga Free]
Hey, look what the wind blew in, bullshit
I go to sleep to wake up to it every day, I swear
I don’t see how some muthafuckas bear
But they do, and anything you do long enough you gon’ get at it quick
Whether you gotta pimp a hoe or slang hot dogs on a stick
Bake...and…shake…us, I’m gettin’ hoe money in Vegas
It took some time for this, man, see I got two kids and I love ‘em too
So reconsider that player hatin’ ‘cause it’s a few things we can do
And I can count on one hand how many people love me
And I can count on the other hand how many people got love for me
Now, Bud (bud) Weiser (weiser) gin (gin) 'gnac (yak)
I’m not just her pimp, I’m also her quarterback
I’m rollin’, feelin’ like I smoked an ounce
Hittin’ dips in my shit because I like to bounce
She said she never gave head and I knew she lied
Because she sucked my dick like it was apple pie

[Verse 3: Magnificent]
I’m across the nation with the Magnificent globetrotters
And don’t get mad if it happens to be one of your daughters
I’m space age pimpin’ with some ice age game
So from the past to the present, they will know thy name
My chariot’s a Benz and my scepter’s a pimp stick
My game is artistic, for the cheddar I go ballistic
It’s my jones, I need it, I’m in a zone undefeated
So leave me ‘lone or get heated, I’m on a mission to get it
When I get, don’t split it, ‘cause it’s all mine
Not a third, not a quarter but all the time
My linguistics’ll turn her out faster than a match’ll burn out
I’m global like warming, noble and charming
I get farther like NASA, colder than Alaska
Or a polar bear, colder than an Eskimo in underwear
Subzero ism that gets up in ‘em
Through leather or denim, in any weather I send ‘em

[Verse 4: Mac Dre]
Why don’t she? Why won’t she?
One day she gon’ see, she got me lonely
Those are words you’ll never hear from us
You didn’t know it’s pimpin’ over here with us?
Oh, what a hit we made
Never givin’ a bitch a break
Sippin’ on them vintage grapes
Police we quick to shake
Pedal to the metal, never hit the brakes
Smokin’ hella weed, no sticks or shakes
Funk with hella niggas, I instigate
Dumpin’ on niggas, I hit and skate
Fans they picture take, your mans they pimpetrate
I’mma take all the money the hoe make
She gon’ keep it comin’, man, and don’t wait
I don’t fake, I don’t hate when I put my voice on tape
Everybody goes so stupid dumb
Everybody say, ‘Man, he can come’
Like 151 Bacardi Rum, Dre gon’ get the party dumb
Always got bomb for the lung
And when the police come, man, I run
Yolking something, dosing something
Smoking something, Syko, make them hoes sing

(Oh, what a hit we made) (Repeated in background)
