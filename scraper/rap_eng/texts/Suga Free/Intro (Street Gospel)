[Suga Free}
Good Evening
I'm Suga Free
And you,I don't know who the fuck you is
But ima tell you like this
Ain't no tricks living here
Ain't no suckers living here
Ain't no punk ass hoe living here
Cause see baby we about getting pay
And baby we about getting off right way,in a real way
You waste my time,I waste your time
You lie to me,I lie to you
50/50 thang baby
So this is the gospel
Suga Free's gospel
Street Gospel
