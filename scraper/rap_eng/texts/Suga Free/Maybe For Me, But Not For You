(Yeah, its something)
Man, I need to get my pictures, and my grease and my cosmetics cuz

[Chorus: Suga Free]
Now, this is what pimpin is supposed to be
He said "Maybe For You, But Not For Me"
He gotta girlfriend and he loves her so
But I got a prostitute and I love my hoe
Maybe For You, But Not For Me!?
Hoes get paid but bitches fuck for free
Pomona Town is the city I am from
If you a trick a bitch will play you dumb

[Verse 1: Suga Free]
Now yo ass smarter than a motherfucker
You got to suck for what you hanker for
Oh, yo, I lay me down to sleep
I'm living for me but not for you, bitch
You better tell your boyfriend what to do
Cuz I'll slap the taste right out ya mouth
Real playas now what I'm talkin bout
West coast to pimp ot not to pimp (haa haa)
I say whats easy for me is confusing to him
Its like, talking astrophysics to an old wine-o to drunk to listen
Now your ass wondering like a motherfucker
We beat the rap like he beat the sucker
Almighty dollar root of all evil
I gots to have it like everyday people

[Chorus: Suga Free]
Now, this is what pimpin is supposed to be
He said "Maybe For You, But Not For Me"
He gotta girlfriend and he loves her so
But I got a prostitute and I love my hoe
Maybe For You, But Not For Me!?
Hoes get paid but bitches fuck for free
Pomona Town is the city I am from
If you a trick a bitch will play you dumb

[Verse 2: Casino and (Suga Free)]
They couldn't teach me the game the game is in me
Not to mention my hustle philosophies
I know a bomb little hoodie fucking for free
I chewed off her ear now she out fucking for me
Stretch marks and bullet wounds but still a hoe
Tattooed on her tits and he dont live at home
The way we crackin for her but not for you
It could be counting for thots shocks and crew
And once you get her you got her, shes locked to you
It's good game and the shit could do a lot for you
The homies asked me how I get them to do what they do
Well, I don't know I just tell them and they follow suit

(It's me, Casino the G is bossy in tone
But got it crackin until the break of dawn
My nigga Vince wreck a microphone
Pomona meets Norwich Milwaukee its on)

[Casino and a (Homie)]
(Ey ey queso, ay I heard Suga Free and you are homies)
Oh is that right ese
(Yeah homie, we got to get at him dog you know whats up dog. yrah you know what I mean, people say hes cool but you know how it is homie. Ey ey you got to check him out dog you know what I mean, you got to get at him real quick)

[Chorus: Suga Free]
Now, this is what pimpin is supposed to be
He said "Maybe For You, But Not For Me"
He gotta girlfriend and he loves her so
But I got a prostitute and I love my hoe
Maybe For You, But Not For Me!?
Hoes get paid but bitches fuck for free
Pomona Town is the city I am from
If you a trick a bitch will play you dumb


[Verse 3: Suga Free]
Not matter what enjoy the life you live
Stay sucka live cuz thats just way it is
See I prefer to pimp the hoe and her
But looking out for the prosecute to occur
Of the public agreed to take her
I know they wishing my hoe would wash me up
So they could they get back and go to lock me up
They blaming in prostitution in Pomona on me
Saying that I'm lacing daughter to the whole meet
Back in west valley detention center
Driving with no licence my wheels suspended
And they moved all the girls to live with Jeff
Now twin towers and no country is straight up mail
And now they bring the food to you
No more Jim Jones in the jail chow hall food
Still making niggas write to west side for nothing
Paid from they get paid by the state for transport
Now it take me forever to get my mail
But you got to catch the train to hell
They caught you, break soon the wall
Squat and cough now I'm shackled up to ya'll
Maybe For Me But Not For Him
I left my life to pimp and pimp and pimp
Over and over and over again

[Chorus: Suga Free]
Now, this is what pimpin is supposed to be
He said "Maybe For You, But Not For Me"
He gotta girlfriend and he loves her so
But I got a prostitute and I love my hoe
Maybe For You, But Not For Me!?
Hoes get paid but bitches fuck for free
Pomona Town is the city I am from
If you a trick a bitch will play you dumb
