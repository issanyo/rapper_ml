[Intro: Suga Free]
Ouija Board tournament
Mmmm
Well
Ahhh

[Clue Dogg]
Wake up, take the time and think

[Verse 1: Suga Free]
She act in order when we started out
Kept her attention, let her run her mouth
She got to tell me everything in a single breath
Oh yes, I listened like a counselor at my very best
I kept the sex away 'cause that would ruin my whole damn thang
No, I don´t expect you to understand the way I run my game
Been with her a year and I ain´t touched her yet
'Cause I see more in her than you can, man, that´s simple respect
No, I don´t mind if you sleepin' with her later
Just don´t forget to bring her back home to me when you pay her
Now, can you tell me where your woman at? Oh, is she at work?
Gettin' sexually harassed, perhaps. You know your girl a flirt
Man, if you only knew how many lies that she told you a week
You trust her too much, you ready to cut your wrist because her new love
I can laugh so hard at some of the things men do
Put all his eggs in one basket, he in love with you
He said that you belong to him and only him, no other man
'Cause it'll hurt him till he's a suicidal, typical man
Don't set your feelings and your world around a girl like that
'Cause she can give a fuck less about what you feel, Jack
See I don´t go through that, I never will, as long as I live
We so relaxed together, confident, a hoe and her pimp

[Chorus: Clue Dogg]
Game don´t wait for no one
Even a little could be right when control begun
Exactly what is it you want from me, dreams I´m sellin'
Pimpin´ havin' his way
Wake up, take the time and think

[Verse 2: Suga Free]
Now, I don't buy dreams, I sell' em
Go tell your man you need some money, baby, sweat him
'Cause I ain´t to giving bitches money 'cause they cool and shit
She had me looking like a muthafuckin´fool and shit
Probably laughing with her friends about how stupid you are
But you don´t care because she is always in your brand new car
Why you catch the bus to work, man, don´t you look at yourself
Man, love don´t love nobody playa, let me give you some help
At first I though she was your momma, talkin, to you like if you was a kid
Disrespecting your manhood all in front of your friends
Now, that´s what love is? You settin' up yourself for some heartbreak
Man up and stand up, that´s how we do it in our way
I seen her hit you one day too and made you sleep on the couch
Ain´t that a bitch, on top of that didn't you pay for that house?
Oh, that's ok with you? what, she mad?
Oh, you must do this stuff all the time at the pad
Well, let me tell you something, we don´t play that dawg
So get your head up out of the clouds and your mind up out of the fog
Fathers, please take care of your daughters
This Suga Free, man, please

[Chorus: Clue Dogg]
Exactly what is it you want from me, dreams I´m sellin'
Pimpin´ havin' his way
Wake up, take the time and think

[Verse 3: Suga Free]
I feel sorry for her, yes I´m struggling too
But I'mma work all week and give my money to you, for what?
You got a job, don´t you? That ain´t enough?
Tell you what, baby, to me you ain´t all that tough
I ain´t intimidated by your looks and by your stuff
I´m the type that pop my collar and tell your ass to shut up
I ain´t your boyfriend, just call me daddy
I´m puttin' my money in my pocket, don't ask to drive my Caddy
And I´m tellin' you now to watch your tone of voice when you talkin' to me
I won´t respond like he did, nah ah, because my name is Suga Free
And try to hit me like you hit him, and I'mma hit your as back
I´ll make your bold ass think about that
You catch the bus to work
Oh, and tell your coworker friend that he can date you after work
Just give me some ends
And all that complication, lovy dovy, snugglin' up crap
Put you in the couch and think of pimpin ho now

[Chorus: Clue Dogg]
Game don´t wait for no one
Even a little could be right when control begun
Exactly what is it you want from me, dreams I´m sellin'
Pimpin´ havin' his way
Wake up, take the time and think

[Outro Suga Free &  Courtney Jade]
Fuck them square bitches
Ain't nothin' but problems

[Courtney Jade]
Always, always
He's Suga Free
Fly for life
Su-Suga Free
He's fly for life
Excuse me, I beg your pardon, miss

[Suga Free]
Ain´t that a bitch. huh
I love you, I can´t see you with nobody else
I can´t see another man hold you
Pfft, nigga, the fuck outta here with that shit, trick

[Courtney Jade]
Excuse me, I beg your pardon, miss
