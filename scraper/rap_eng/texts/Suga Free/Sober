[Verse 1: Rittz]
The city is glamming
In the spot coming from my gucci lenses
Plus tour busses scoops and benzes
I ain't used to this I came through the trenches
Now my cousin fill up on boots and end em
Said I can't pronounce multiple bank accounts
Now I give all my hommies all my hand me downs
Shit I used to get a hundred bucks a show
Now I get a couple grand to come and stand around
And drink shots of crown but never snitched to real
One too many gotta catch some air
Rooftop parties bars everywhere
But success don't rest out of hair corvair
Big rozay ho's day when I come and show them
This the me I get 'em tipsy freeze
Be going both ways pussy lickers skills that go showcase
Late night bunch of hoes at my doorway

[Hook:]
It's 4 in the morning and the party don't end
Baby come over, baby come over
Our clothes on the ground drinking Crown till we spin
Fuck till we're sober

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Two fucker take a break to take a shot
Restaurant closed so we go in
Have my iphone out making homemade porn
And she screaming oh Lord, like she born again
One of us going down on snorkeling
Walk by my hotel room door and
I'm sure you heard us bone and probably came the moment
And fuck a maid keeping knocking reorienting
She give me oral then I told her you're a 10
Lying cause your really bout an eight and a half
But a head game is the greatest I had
It's a damn shame that I'm singing the last
Bet it was a blast she was making the splash
And I got one more favor to ask
Can I put a little bit cocaine on your ass
I took a sniff and I told the bitch slider this mess

[Hook:]
It's 4 in the morning and the party don't end
Baby come over, baby come over
Our clothes on the ground drinking crown till we spin
Fuck till we're sober

[Verse 3: Suga Free]
I'm feeling like a rabbit coming out of the egg
Feeling like a motherfucker breaking down record my tool
The nerve of this nigga with a flat on glove
Hella body with a bounce this is pimpin ho
Polished, Groomed! shake with a fine grim
And buffed out to a shine that’ll blind a bitch, don’t I walk like I Got I all down to a science bitch
Kinda like domino's pizza
And don't get too comfortable in the morning
Money always feel better than sex to me
The trick if I pick it up and ask for free
Motherfucker flamboyant
When I walked on the snow baby
And the sound of Sade fills the room with jamma bitch which fills my pocket
I like to wiggle wiggle it more I'm a hustler
Walk around pimpin' I don't touch 'em
I thought you knew that pimps don't go to jail
For pimpin', they go for mispimpin'
So don't do that...
And understand God made pimps so a ho can have a man
And a trick won't understand
Suga Free... my man!

[Hook:]
It's 4 in the morning and the party don't end
Baby come over, baby come over
Our clothes on the ground drinking crown till we spin
Fuck till we're sober
