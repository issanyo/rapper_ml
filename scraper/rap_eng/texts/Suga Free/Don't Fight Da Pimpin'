[Verse 1]
Don't get mad when you see me with my prostitute
I see in time it takes a toll on you square ass dudes
I can't believe the power I possess that makes you so mad
If it ain't the pimp music, it's the game I have
You know how stupid you look at me when you hatin, my friend?
I'll prolly have to blast yo ass if I see you again
You on a bus stop pushin that bitch till it came
You say goodbye for 30 minutes cause you gots no game
Who you talkin to like that, don't question me hoe
You the bitch in kindergarten
That got her mouth washed out with soap
Ho I'm a pimp I'm from Pomona I got game I got class
I got sucker-repellent on me homie I'll beat yo ass
I hear you pimpin now, huh?
Well ain't that nice
Ain't never sent a prostitute nowhere a day in your life
And tell your homies I was at a music grinding
With my prostitutes standing right out front
Then tellin me you had two of them punk

[Hook]
Don't, fight the pimpin'
Don't, fight the pimpin'
Don't, fight the pimpin'
Nigga don't, fight the pimpin

[Verse 2]
Her name was bitch
Cause she fucked for free
But not when Suga met her man
Not after fuckin with me
Oh no, cause either you gon be a run-down-the-hill-and-get-some bitch
Or walk-down-the-hill-and-get-em-all hustler
So come on
With ya bad self in high heels on
Some on
Lips, hips, fingertips on the stroll
Come on
Respect the game bitch
You do as you're told
Cause I been pimpin prostitutes since 17 years old
Done seen LP, Central cell, Warren Y, AY, A-Cap, Miller, Cleopatra, Camp Rocky, alpha ball cap graduated from state
And got my game from all the freaks gonna wreck my case
It's my prerogative
Run my game bitch and it's gonna come back
Pimp pimp pimp pimp pimp pimp P-I-M-P positive
Look for the holder knock (knock)
Give her the sugar lock (lock)
Get at the ho, strip the ho
Now I got ho on the cock (cock)

[Hook]
Don't, fight the pimpin'
Don't, fight the pimpin'
Don't, fight the pimpin'
Nigga don't, fight the pimpin

[Verse 3]
Now how fine do I gotta get?
To have a prostitute servin me the way she do
Now how fine do I gotta get?
If I wanna wait 5 years to give you the blues
Now how fine do I gotta get?
If I kick it with her would gettin bang nigga what's my name
Now how fine do I gotta get?
If I jack off with a sock in the sunshine homie
And you see that yellow spot
I'm a full-fledged pimp
I made two hoes faint
But I'mma listen to yo ass say what I can and I can't?
Fuck that! Man this Laneway, straight from the dirt
And I'll beat a bitch ass till she respects my work
Old tired ass nigga don't see she wanna be snatched
And wonder why them bitches leavin with no dap and no snacks
And rather sit here with no cigarettes and no beer
Complainin about how you can't pay yo bills
And the bitch right here

[Hook]
