[Verse 1]
Bitch killa, ain't no love bitch
I got finesse from the best and we don't play that shit
Now if you ain't the shit to you then who are you the shit to?
Be all you can be, do all you can do
Now how you love me when you don't love yourself
Bitches always trying to be somebody else
Fuck your compliments bitch cause I know I'm the shit
From the hair to the nails to the game I spit
You gots nothing coming
And if you disrespect me, ho, bitch you better start running
I control my own destiny, baby, shit, ho
So Get in where fit in, bitch
And if you smell something stanking that's me cause I'm the shit
Now woulda coulda took offence if I took another way
And didn't call her a bitch cause ima see the ho another day
And whisper something pimpish in her ear
Just a lil bit ah ah nigga
And if I tell a bitch to come there the comes
She ain't shit never gone be shit
Don't want shit never had shit and too lazy to go and get shit
Now momma raised your ass thinking she was the shit
You woulden't of been a broke lazy lying throwback bitch
I'ma tell her
I don't buy dreams bitch I sell em

[Chorus]
You don't know what I know (no ya don't, yah)
Bitch I'm so unpimpable (can't break me, unbreakable)
You don't see what I see (uhuh)
I guess its just the pimp in me
If you ain't the shit to yourself you ain't to nobody else

[Verse 2]

Fuck you bitch and the horse you rode in on

I guess its just the pimp in me
If you ain't the shit to yourself you ain't to nobody else

[Verse 3]
Bitch I'm a pimping ass maniac
Spouse-abusing wife beater
Lunatic predator, macaroni mind reader
A good judgement of character, a gentleman a leisure
Fuck her squeeze her, tease her, please her
Backslap her with a dick, slap her with a dick
Slap her with a dick, slap her with a dick
Now put a dick in her ear, a dick in her ear
Put a dick in her ear, a dick in her ear
Now blind the bitch, blind the bitch
Blind the bitch, blind the bitch
Now lie to her ass before she lie to you
Just dont forget to knock her teeth out of her mouth before she do
Now remind me to whoop your ass (when we get home)
Remind! me to whoop your ass (real soon)
Bitch go get me something to beat chu with
I know your crafty but you ain't putting me through shit
Take some money from me bitch suga free ain't shit
Fuck around a week later can't find the bitch
She outta pocket yeh i noticed shit she done to yo ass
Thats why ima knock her ass out right in front of your ass
Im suga free the pimp pomona style bangin on ya cuz
Im the boss of that city what chu thought this was
You got grove on
Fuck around and get stole on
Ride with me or get rolled on
So if you see my hoe actin out of order
I know you won't report her
Thats why im bout to floor her
Go do your nails ur cuticles dead
Let something happen to one hair on my beautiful head

[Chorus]
You don't know what I know (no ya don't, yah)
Bitch I'm so unpimpable (can't break me, unbreakable)
You don't see what I see (uhuh)
I guess it's just the pimp in me
If you ain't the shit to yourself you ain't to nobody else

You dont know what i know (You dont know what i know)
Bitch im so umpimpable (bitch im so umpimpable)
You dont see what i see (you dont see what i see)
I guess its just the pimp in me (i guess its just the pimp in me )
Pimp in me, pimp in me ( pimp in me, pimp in me)
I guess its just the pimp in me
You dont know what i know (You dont know what i know)
Bitch im so umpimpable (bitch im so umpimpable)
You ain't been where ive been (you ain't been where ive been)
Around the world and back again (around the world and back again)
You dont pop your collar mayne (you dont pop your collar mayne)
You dont stack no dollars mayne (you dont stack no dollars mayne)
