Let me tell you a story, Red Riding Hood
She smoked Primo's cause she thought it taste good
Oh y'all wanna see me rank this? Put ons your best game face
And at the same pace we'll see if it's the same taste at the same race
Uh, uh... now tell me who in the house know about the Quik?
(We do!) Yah, I mean really, really?!
Don't try to understand what we do, yah, my lord!
Wait, let me rest a minute...

[Chingy]
Rest for a minute
They don't know about this here Free
I'mma tell 'em like this though

Uh, my hoes up here love the ozone
Black, white, caramel or redbone
It's a fact, I'm the mack like Pretty Ton'
Plus I keep goin', the homie hold on
Slick like Rick, DJ like Quik, Suga free like Free
You niggas can't see me (whoa!)
The only hood you ever saw was on a sweatshirt
This will make your neck jerk 'til ya sweat dirt
I like fo'-fives but still I put in tec work
Got some technology shit that'll make your vest hurt
Puffin' the best pur-ple weed
Stalks fat, no seeds

See the Lion didn't have no courage and the Scarecrow didn't have no brain
And you can't control your dick so that means you ain't got no game
Oh you a pimp now huh? But I'mma go on and let ya slide
Cause you don't know what it's like to live this life and really be fly
Yah, shocked your monkey, hey-hey! Really? My lord!...
I wanna talk but I'm goin' through hell
Got shocked to shit and sued for stankin' and on my way to jail
The almighty dollar, and even though you kickin' me when I'm down
I'm still about my might dollar
Doctors like nurses, and secretaries like lawyers
And housewives love they husband
But you playa haters don't know that hoes like pimps
I'm after ya... So excuse me Ms. Prostitute
And I, I beg your pardon Playa Hater
And sometimes, sometimes, playa haters never um seem to amaze me
I had to see 'em comin' around
I know mysery loves company but that's crazy
So take it from me, your friendly neighborhood playa partner Suga Free
Down... ee-own... ee-yow-ee-own, ee-yow-ee-own, down, down
Want a lovely sunny day, like a lemon yellow sun!...
