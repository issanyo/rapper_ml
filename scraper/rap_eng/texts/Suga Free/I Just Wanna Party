[Hook: YG]
Mama ain't raised no fool
Daddy told me never leave the house without my tool
Grandpa told me never trust a sucka nigga from the street
Grandma said she love me and she always praying for me
But I just wanna party, I don’t wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I’ll beat the fuck out of a nigga, why you bullshittin'?

[Verse 1: YG]
I'm drunk off Hennessy, hope I don't run into my enemies
That dark liquor give you energy
Now I ain't rich, but I'm finna be
Your baby mama's a flip, she wanna hit a G
(Ahhh shit!) I'm back on that bool shit
But she ain't fuckin' and that's bullshit
I can't die, I got too much to live for
I'm getting money, that's what niggas rob and kill for
Fucking with Tenisha and Keisha
But when Keisha see Tenisha she gon' whoop her ass
All my homies gangbangers
They dry their clothes on hangers
All these hoes fuckin', but they don't wanna seem like a ho
So you gotta hit 'em on the low (hit em' on the D-Low!)
West side, get money gang
Socked the mouth for trippin', he lost his watch and earrings

[Hook: YG]
Mama ain't raised no fool
Daddy told me never leave the house without my tool
Grandpa told me never trust a sucka nigga from the street
Grandma said she love me and she always praying for me
But I just wanna party, I don’t wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I’ll beat the fuck out of a nigga, why you bullshittin'?

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Nigga, I'm from Hoover Street, dirty pictures in my cellphone
On 52nd Street I'm well-known
Hoover stomp until the cops come
Silver satan get the job done
Money ain't everything, but still I'm rich
Money ain't everything, I'm still gon' crip
From Figueroa to Harv Side where we sock on lips
We break on jaws, niggas since VCR's, nigga
We hop out cars, nigga
I be groovin' 'til I die, smokin' weed until I'm fried
I could sell a key to God
Pants saggin' with the Glock, I ain't wanna pick the box, uh
All my homies gangbangers
We keep a thumb between our two fingers
We trippin' off the Henny
So don't let me catch you slippin' in the 50's, Ricky

I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I’ll beat the fuck out of a nigga, why you bullshittin'?

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Nigga, I'm from Bounty Hunters, East Side lunatic
Gang bang, slap a bitch, I ain't with the extras
I ain't got a stunt double
You ain't got no hands so they might let the gun touch you
Is you bangin' or you ballin', nigga?
You a fax machine, we can't call it, nigga
Everybody ain't a friend, reason why I keep a fo'
You wanna gamble with your life?
Bet that on the ten or four, nigga!
She bouncing that ass, go 'head, shake it
And if she give me that back, bitch, I'ma break it
Shit, that pussy is overrated, some niggas'll chase it
She acting like she be nuttin', some bitches'll fake it
You fightin' and savin' these hoes, know that you losin'
These bitches the reason why some niggas be snoozin'
YG, dawg, you heard how they left his brains hanging?
Shouldn't have chucked his fingers up if he ain't banging
I'm sayin'...

I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody

[Outro]
But I'll beat the fuck out of a bitch
Why you bullshitting?
