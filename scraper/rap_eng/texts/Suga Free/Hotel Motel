[Intro]
I said hotel, motel, Holiday Inn (Say what?)
I said if you can’t pay the fee, too bad, your ass just can’t come in
I said hotel, motel, Holiday Inn (Say what?)
I said if you can’t pay the fee, too bad, your ass just can’t come in

[Verse 1: Suga Free]
Check, it really please us, don’t it?
Thanks to the almighty pimp god, I’m on my knees praying
With a candle with a picture of me and Jesus on it
I get down, saying, “Fuck the side talk”
(What you want, baby?) Bitch, I want you on the sidewalk
Now you gave me 450 last night, right? OK, now add 250 more
That’s a thou, now get back on the track before I bust you in your mouth
This ain’t no game, bitch; this ain’t funny, nigga
You want some pussy, potna? I want some money, nigga
Suga Free’ll pimp or die, nigga, use what you got
And if you ain’t got what it takes to spark that game and stack that not
Then you can miss me with that trick shit
Muthafucka, you would not believe the money that my bitch get
Now that the pimpin’s been recognized
It’s time to move on and groove on with Madd Nation on the Westside
Tony Lane, Tooly, Tron, Inch, Dog, Clue, and Bubba, Kuulayd
To leave ya, peace, I’m out this muthafucka

[Chorus]
I said hotel, motel, Holiday Inn (Say what?)
I said if you can’t pay the fee, too bad, your ass just can’t come in
I said hotel, motel, Holiday Inn (Say what?)
I said if you can’t pay the fee, too bad, your ass just can’t come in

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
Now, problem one: solved
I jacked it off and served it to the Kleenex, ah
‘Cause bitch, your fiancé loves you a whole lot
And you out there taking dick to the jawbone, the whole shot
Stop, spot up, shot up, then you got up
Dick extracurricular, bitch, you gets a lot of
And that’s why I pay you no attention when we up in the club
I need a drink, bitch, give me a dub
See, we make all you hoes stand up in the middle in the floor
And take off all your clothes, because that’s all you know
And we watch you juggle dicks until it’s time to go
Now don’t talk about it, be about it
Your phone ringin’—that’s a dick, bitch, see about it
If he about it, he’ll spit in your muthafuckin’ face and be out
And Suga Free, Young Quik, and Madd Nation, we out
We at the…

[Chorus]
Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn (Say what?)
I said if you can’t pay the fee, too bad, your ass just can’t come in
I said hotel, motel, Holiday Inn (Say what?)
I said if you can’t pay the fee, too bad, your ass just can’t come in

[Verse 3: Tooly]
She must been born in a leap year, Quik (Why?) because she tweakin’
As I recall, her last case of dick was last weekend
I bet she didn’t know I know her like that, Carmen
A super psychotic, super exotic woman
A young Creole, with a free hole for niggas to get up in
But would she like to make some ends? I’m curious
If I could turn her into a professional dick gobbler
Then I could increase the knot in my pocket

[Verse 4: Tron]
Steppin’ up out the hotel room at the casino
The Reno, ‘bout to break this bitch for what she know
Now, if you walk over to the slot machine
You walk away to the gambling table
You see that breaking ‘cause you able
Walk upstairs, leave the money on the floor
I’ma open up the door, I’m just gon’ get it and go
Young Tron ain’t no simp
I’m hustlin’ hoes, pimpin’ muthafuckas ‘til it’s time to go up at the…

[Chorus]
Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn (Say what?)
I said if you can’t pay the fee, too bad, your ass just can’t come in
I said hotel, motel, Holiday Inn (Say what?)
I said if you can’t pay the fee, too bad, your ass just can’t come in

[Verse 5: Kuulayd]
Now could you tell me why my mind’s gone?
Could you tell me why my mind’s blown?
Is it that the fact that my dick is full grown?
I’m thinking about you, and I be playing with it every day
There’s no way no how you gon’ stay
Oh baby, won’t you think about it
Huh, you wanna play a sex game
You wanna play with my ding-a-ling
Kuulayd ain’t payin’ for the puss’
It ain’t worth going inside your bush, so much smush
Please go away!
See now you done set it off, and give you a whiff of that drink
Stand up, get up, wait a minute, hold me back
She thinks I’m paying for the room
But I don’t need your bush—I’ll go and find another pussy
Don’t believe it when she say “She loves you”, that’s a lie
It’s just another way to keep you buying—girl, stop trying
You lied in the first place—now who’s paying the fee?
You better get to walking, acting like you don’t know

[Chorus]
I said hotel, motel, Holiday Inn (Say what?)
I said if you can’t pay the fee, too bad, your ass just can’t come in
I said hotel, motel, Holiday Inn (Say what?)
I said if you can’t pay the fee, too bad, your ass just can’t come in

I said hotel, motel, Holiday Inn (Say what?)
I said if you can’t pay the fee, too bad, your ass just can’t come in
I said hotel, motel, Holiday Inn (Say what?)
I said if you can’t pay your fee, too bad, your ass just can’t come in

[Outro: Suga Free]
Yeah, Kuulayd, man, look here
Last night, man, I was on some old way out shit, man
I felt like I wasn’t even myself, man, you know what I’m sayin’
This shit just be getting up in a muthafucka, man
And I just handle my business
I just takes care of my business, man, you know
I’m not finna go hungry for no muthafuckin’ body out here
In a real way
