I told ya'll! One two one two...

[Suga Free: Verse 1]
You wanna know why I never went to recess at school everyday?
I was too busy filing my nails and telling my teachers I didn't play
I wanted to shake em up and wake em up sipping out of a paper cup
Bucking em bucking em breaking up
The West the Coast who hating on us?
I'm shaking my dice my dice is hot
My hustling don't quit
Kiss the ivory for me baby
Now blow on them, make a wish
What they hitting for?
Shake shake em shake em
Eleven
I'm to sexy for this tray four six five in the club
In the hood at the park
Out of time, single parent keeping her hustle up
No you can't be mad at that
She in the club she got a job
She want a meal but you a snack
She in her favorite club in hollywood she puts it in the air!
Oh Happy Pimpin!
Suga Free the gangster mac, the happy player
The hot dice clicka clacka,West Coast mac attacker, super soaker packa packa  shake a pocket patter
Able to talk the peeling off of a lemon
Or the string out of her ass
And got more crack than a plumber
And don't nobody want none, cuz one day she threw it into the sky and the season turned to summer

[Chorus]
Shake that ass
Shake that ass
Shake
Shake them dice
Shake them dice
Shake
Shake them haters
Shake them haters
Shake

[Verse 2]
Now I, asked them what they hitting for
Now I, I ain't into playing poker, nah
But I'll shoot the shit up out of some dice
Why U Bullshittin'?
These ain't no skittles or no polla seeds I bet I hit
My baby need some brand new shoes, you know how ballers get
City of Angels Los Angeles we puff puff the best
And I've been with her a year today
And I still ain't gave her no sex
Keep her attention like the southern california burning weather
In pocket and so obedient like a loyal German Shepherd
She don't want nobody too nice
Just grab her like them two dice
And shake her up and throw her to her trick
What's wrong with you Dice?
I put the "I" in pimp you gon respect the tireless P spit
A bossy flossy undeniable clacka clacka body snatcher
Suga Free let me be the brightest lightbulb in your chandelier
Cuz these idiots couldn't send a bitch just to a liquor store to buy my beer
She rolling her eyes cussing him out like he a punk when he a man
Who's the trick? and she know it, who's the suga free fan?
Whos your friend with the thick hair?
Cuz she's so fat wherever she going it takes her two trips to get there

[Chorus]
Shake that ass
Shake that ass
Shake them
Shake them dice
Shake them dice
Shake them
Shake them haters
Shake them haters
Shake them
Shake that ass
Shake that ass
Shake them
Shake them dice
Shake them dice
Shake them
Shake them haters
Shake them haters
Shake them

[Verse 3]
Now I, asked them what they hitting for
I'm about to bust you suckers in your mouth
Especially you "pay for sex" cats
Now baby break yourself
Hurry up so you can go and get that
Foggy windows making me sweat
I'm cracking them cuz I want to make a bet
Clocka clocka
Pay that playa, they ain't done them yet
I gamble but not like you do
You wouldn't sell your body boo
Your Momma didn't raise you like that
I know baby, I'm with you
I voted for Obama
Lets put him in the White house
With Jesse Jackson, Al sharpton
And Snoopy thats from my mouth
(laughter)
Now what they hitting for!?
