[Verse 1 : Suga Free ]
Go with that girl will make your nut up, uh
Sugar free up in the club like what up, uh!
Hair whip, fresh fit, feeling fondle
Free with that name, strike game
It just don’t sound cool
No she don’t want you now
But she gonna want you later man
Bitch I’ma be Katt William’s cool by then
Going hard in the player paint
Wash condition, blow dry, press flat iron
Hands clip, nails dipped, you’re something I wanna sell bitch
Yeah sure you ain’t a groupie, plenty lie on it
Rather get tossed around then miss you 25 hunned
Sugar Free, a way better sucka ducka
Check an out of pocket bitch, mayweather motherfucker
Bitch I don’t know what the fuck you think this is
You looking at it as if you say the bitch is
Now temptation, sayin, whoa shut up
Yeah we gonna scratch you till we get you bitch
And ain’t gonna lie now
Now what that horn do?


[Hook] x 2
I went to the mall got a fix
All these hating ass niggas on my dick
I slide through the trap like this
And I left out the party with a brand new bitch


[Verse 2 : Cousin Fik]
I came out the party hella over
The opposite of sober
New bitch, fresh out the box
Still going up, like a good stock
Dope dick thrown back, for the gwap
You know you wanna give me neck, you a bop
Show me you got intellect, give me top
Cause if not, ho I’m shutting down shop
Bitch!
Sick with it, bitch straight about the fucking V
Fuck with them then you know you gotta fuck with me
Cousin Fik, I ain’t never been a sucker G
Ain’t another nigga ever did time cause of me
Puffing on trees, sipping bubbly
Put her hb if the double tree
Say she wanna poster up all because of me
And in the next morning I’m right back in the streets and I

[Hook] x 2


[Verse 3 : Problem]
Tell her bout the thang with the bop
Had a bitch busting big like a chopper
Prrrr, killing that pussy, call the coppers
Nigga mad cause I had his baby come like a doctor
Moving like a mobster, eating on pasta
Run up on me wrong, you gon dread it like a rasta
By my clock I bite cheese like rat
Molly got my hoes here twisted like that
Diamond Lane gang nigga come get with it
Keep a thick nurse cause I’m so sick with it
Shout out to the water, shout out to the bay
Fuck away with us betta put a k in
C.O.M.P.T.O.N. and that is what I’m repping
Tryina find a brainiac so I can get a lesson
Busting nut then get higher
After that it’s a rap, no flat iron
