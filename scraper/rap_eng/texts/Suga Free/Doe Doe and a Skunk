[Chorus]
Smokin' on that doe doe and a skunk
As I bump with the humps in the trunk
I'm sippin' on that Hennessy because it's all good
As I bounce to a party in the hood
Smokin' on that doe doe and a skunk
As I bump with the humps in the trunk
I'm sippin' on that Hennessy because it's all good
As I bounce to a party in the hood

[Verse 1: Suga Free + Tony Lane]
Slide, slide, slippety slide
Because I heard it was a party jumpin' on the Westside
Ride, glide, sho' you right
So I'ma drink this Hennessy and get my head real tight
Now the rat-tat-tat-tat strapped on my back-back
Not to jack but to crack a playa hater talkin' smack
'Cause the party that I'm headed for is oh so deep
And it's a Tony Lane thang so I'm bound to creep
Now Suga Free don't dance but I might tonight
And my hoes can't go until my money is right
Now I'm about to get ghost after I G up from the feet up
And roll this weed up, let the car heat up
Speed up with the beat up and roll
Baby, hold that steering wheel while I roll this indo
Better known as the magic wand, the bomb, the antidote
The twilight smoke of all smoke
As I swerve by the curb on superb Dayton spokes
Hittin' 16 switches in the 'Lac
While your girl send you to Players Anonymous, I perform like The Mack
I sell a dream to her like a quiet storm
The only reason why baby wear panties is to keep her ankles warm
Now as I tip toe out the Cadillac
I see my homie DJ Quik and Tony Lane with that sticky green thang
Ain’t ever been a inner planetary type of high
That can prevent a playa from gettin' his pie, so let me fly

[Chorus]
Smokin' on that doe doe and a skunk
As I bump with the humps in the trunk
I'm sippin' on that Hennessy because it's all good
As I bounce to a party in the hood
Smokin' on that doe doe and a skunk
As I bump with the humps in the trunk
I'm sippin' on that Hennessy because it's all good
As I bounce to a party in the hood

[Verse 2: Suga Free]
Slurs, as I begin to hit the chronic, I see blurs
I'm paranoid but I still want that herb
Somebody wet me with the 'gnac
'Cause my cotton mouth is back but I'm feelin' superb
I'm in la-la land, and I'm tweaking
I'm in la-la land, but I see these girls freaky
I'm in la-la land, time to start creepin'
One, two, three, I emerge as a G
The chronic got my membrane stuck
I'm Suga Free and I don't give a f...
And my eyes are oh so low
That I can barely focus in on my folks
Sway, it's reserve, as I tip-toe
Slip and slide to the flo' with a hizoe
Really though, here we go, hoes
Every time I look around, I see hoes
So many different freaks to be chose
So what you sayin'? What you sayin'?
Spit that game and bust these hoes
Finna separate a puppy from a dog—how?
Catch a nigga slippin' with this freak and bow wow
The bait was took, her skirt got hooked, her man got shook
'Cause that's the way it's written down in a player's book
To a bitch thinkin' just like glue
Don't let it bounce off me, so it can stick on you
Now if you got a sack of weed say, "Right" (right)
Now hold it up and wave it from side to side
'Cause a party ain't a party if you ain't got weed
With a cloud of contact smoke that I can book breathe
Yeah, now I can feel my heart beat
Hey, Suga Free, come take this weed from me
And something's wrong, I think I'm sprung, off of that twee.. Suga Free
And I feel so high, my mouth is dry
But I wanna fly in the sky and say goodbye as I glide
Sees, as I take a deep breath from that boo-boo AKA the chronic
Not that woo-wop that you got
Separate mine from yours, fool
I want the bomb like every other bud head do
The Surgeon General has just informed you and I
To inhale and exhale, to prevail, now farewell

[Chorus]
Smokin' on that doe doe and a skunk
As I bump with the humps in the trunk
I'm sippin' on that Hennessy because it's all good
As I bounce to a party in the hood
Smokin' on that doe doe and a skunk
As I bump with the humps in the trunk
I'm sippin' on that Hennessy because it's all good
As I bounce to a party in the hood
(I love to fly away)

Smokin' on that doe doe and a skunk
As I bump with the humps in the trunk
I'm sippin' on that Hennessy because it's all good
As I bounce to a party in the hood
Smokin' on that doe doe and a skunk
As I bump with the humps in the trunk
I'm sippin' on that Hennessy because it's all good
As I bounce to a party in the hood
Smokin' on that doe doe and a skunk
As I bump with the humps in the trunk
I'm sippin' on that Hennessy because it's all good
As I bounce to a party in the hood
Smokin' on that doe doe and a skunk
As I bump with the humps in the trunk
I'm sippin' on that Hennessy because it's all good
As I bounce to a party in the hood
Smokin' on that doe doe and a skunk
As I bump with the humps in the trunk
I'm sippin' on that Hennessy because it's all good
As I bounce to a party in the hood
Smokin' on that doe doe and a skunk
As I bump with the humps in the trunk
I'm sippin' on that Hennessy because it's all good
As I bounce to a party in the hood
Smokin on that doe doe and a skunk
