[Intro: Suga Free]
Hey Berner, this Suga Free man. Let me holla at you

[Verse 1: Berner]
Everybody stressing, ain't no question I'm too fresh
And no, I wouldn't test him, yeah, I'm guessing he'll shoot next
Groupies bust it open while I'm thumbing through show checks
I love my ho bitch, she just got me this Rolex
Dipped in this Louie shit, homie you smoke less
I rolled 20 joints to the neck, leave the house with a vest
40 cal in my 'vette, and my deck bay shit
Ima rep, I'm a vet, white stones on my neck
Puerto Rican bitch, pretty as hell
And this weed got the craziest smell
Ain't no way I'mma fail, Or spend another day in the jail
Big fish in the game I'm a whale, 20 packs in the mail
All that Lean got your face all pale
White ghost on my tail, but I'll make bail
If the Feds really trying to fuck me
I'll tell the judge to suck me

[Hook: Berner]
I'm getting dope money, I'm counting blow money
I love the ho money (I love the ho money)
Me and you (me and you) me and you (me and you)
Me and you (me and you) me and you (me and you)
I'm getting dope money, I'm counting blow money
I love the whole money (I love the ho money)
Me and you (me and you) me and you (me and you)
Me and you (me and you) me and you (me and you)

[Verse 2: Berner]
Court in the morning, bought a foreign on Friday
I buy some new Jordan's, pouring Lean on the highway
She calls me the devil, I'm a hell of an asshole
If you ain't about cash, ho, I'll probably flash yo
25 packs sold, today was a good day
I ain't lose no one close to me, now let's pray
God watch over me, while I hustle
Baby, think about our future while I fuck you, let me tell you why I love you
Huh, and dedication's the key
You're in the islands celebrating with me, they're trying tell you to leave
They told you that I sold you a dream
You just love selling pussy for me, fresh dip
New M6 driftin' while this good shit burns
Hold the Kush smoke in, 'til my whole chest hurts
And if the Feds really trying to fuck me
I'll go to trial with dirty money

[Hook: Berner]

[Verse 3(mostly): Suga Free]
Zero game, no charm
I'm always an alien to these Earthlings when they see me with two bitches on both arms
Hair whipped chest curl locks, and all I ever wanted in life
Was a verse from Snoop, a bitch to quit lying, and my picture on the S-curl box
And I'mma get her pimpin', it's like throwin a 2 by 4 up in the air
And turn it into a pimp stick before it hits the ground and hit her with it
And not a physically hit, it's the recognition from the top to the block
To the knock, turn of day Suga Free valentino look at him he's fly isn't it bitch?
And I ain't used to messes I'm telling you man, I ain't used to guessin
Want one of you fools to test us
They just gave my home boy 35 years for dropping a bitch off, the charge: Human Trafficking
And they're gonna cite the bitch they're gonna let that ho out to ho another day
Bitch you feel good, don't you?
But you won't have the luxury of locking me up when you want to
So fuck a bitch, I was watching Family Feud, Steve Harvey said
"Name one thing you do early in the morning," bitch said, "*Bamp* Suck a dick!"
