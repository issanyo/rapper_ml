[Verse: Asami]
I'm so shine
Kagayaki hanatsu towa ni
Diamond ring mitai ni eternally
Burberry de oou privacy
Fantasy yume no dance machine
Pass da Peas

Takanaru mune tsutsumu Yves Saint Laurent
Kanawanu yume naraba miru na mou
You gotta feel me out, yo
Party crowd

Uzukumatta mama naita Monday (Don't cry)
Tachidomatte katamatta Tuesday (Don't cry)
Ushiro bakka mite sugita Wednesday night
Torimodoseru wa stand up
Mukaikaze ni makenaide Thursday (Stand up)

Hi wo tomoshite mune ni if you feel me now
It's the party time right now
Te wo kazashite ten ni if you feel me
Koshi yurashite baby if you feel me
Hi wo tomoshite mune ni if you feel me now

[Rap Verse: Suga Free]
That's all
Baby girl, cuz, he ain't got no game
And I tell every damn square the same damn thang
It kinda make me wonder why you even messin' with dude
To only find out he a trick and sin, love with you
In the beginning, it's cool, you all he think about
But then he stop showin' it, cuz, you need to get that drinkin' out
Put down that sake [{*nigga*}] and tell her you love her
You never take her nowhere, unless she's under the covers
She get tired of a man gettin' it down for free
You don't care about her, you probably need to
Give her to me
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no boyfriend
Girlfriend reality show
I'm talkin' about
The money you makin' and what she's doing it for
I make her comfortable
She feel right
And I don't, want no sex
I'm more comfortable with Asami and her royalty checks
It's alright Asami, baby, want me to come to Japan
And sock ya pimpin' til you bangin' that this pimpin' ain't planned
Hun?

[Chorus]

[Hook: Asami]

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
