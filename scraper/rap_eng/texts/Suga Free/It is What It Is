[Chorus]
It is what it is
(He came from the mountain top!)
Nigga, it is what it is
(Blessed me with game!)
And every day is Christmas
(Oh, Im so glad the pimp God chose me!)
Nigga that's the business
(Suga motherfucking Free)

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I wake up in the morning like ahh
Brush my teeth and look in the mirror and say ahh
Look at the creases in my Khakis and say ahh
And groom me like a superstar bitch like ahh
Feeling like filing my nails like ahh
And trimming my mustache sharp like ahh
Pimp my hands through my finger waves bitch like ahh
Soak my feet in the water getting a pedicure ahh
Not giving you no dick and no like ahh
Taking bubble baths with the bubbles in it like ahh
I have a beautiful home its on the lake bitch ahh
Mirror mirror on the wall am I feeling like ahh?
Slap the DNA up out your mouth bitch like ahh
And do it again and wouldn’t feel shit bitch like ahh
You stay in pocket like you supposed to bitch like ahh
I'm a king I walk on rose petals bitch like ahh

[Chorus]
It is what it is
(He came from the mountain top!)
Nigga, it is what it is
(Blessed me with game!)
And every day is Christmas
(Oh, Im so glad the pimp God chose me!)
Nigga that's the business
(Suga motherfucking Free)

[Verse 2]
California clear sky sunshine like ahh
Mr. Suga Free I’m so fly like ahh
Go to Redondo or Santa Monica ahh
Look at the water and feel the waves like ahh
And give her a rose and take it back like ahh
Then take it back and slap her ass like ahh
Put her out my car if she touch my Radi-ahh
Go to sleep and count sheep that say bahh
And this is not game bitch like ahh

Got a clean ass tray front and back like ahh

Comfortable seats pure plush like ahh
Six tray dippin front and back like ahh
