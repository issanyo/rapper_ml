[Suga Free: Verse 1]
Here I go, still pimpin like a motherfucker
Suga Free the sucker ducker listen to me baby bubba
Time will tell cuz it told ya well
I've been having game in my name since eleven and twelve
She told me all I have to do is just watch her back
And let her shake her money maker for me, homie get back
We like stars to them, but we live next door
She let me call her a bitch cuz she know I know she a hoe

[Chorus]

[Suga Free: Verse 2]
On a van, don't touch my hair little square bitch you need to understand that time is money, not a game in bed
Spending all damn day with you, go get dressed
You looking good in that
Turn around!

[Bridge]
Oooh, ooh, aah, aah
Oooh, ooh, aah, aah
Oooh, ooh, aah, aah
Oooh, ooh, aah, aah

[Suga Free: Verse 3]
Ain't nothing like pimpin if you know what I know
I tell a bitch to have sex with you, get my doe
She might seem dumb, but she ain't dumb
She smart enough to turn a trick
And get the money when she give you some

[Chorus]
Sexy! Get Loose
What you used to getting paid for
Get Loose
If you tired of being a square ya'll
Get Loose
Wave your hands if you don't care ya'll
Get Loose

[Suga Free: Verse 4]
Talking about a gin, gat, bud, beer
Bitch get my money and bring it here
I broke too many hoes for me to turn back now
Ain't finna let my hoes down
Ain't finna turn in my crown
Don't stop fool, who you thought this was?
An old Hollywood prank just to get me some bank?
You look good now!
Turn around
You look good now!
Turn around

[Bridge]
Oooh, ooh, aah, aah
Oooh, ooh, aah, aah
Oooh, ooh, aah, aah
Oooh, ooh, aah, aah

[Big Steele: Verse 5]
I beg your pardon, may I play your garden?
I promise I won't plant a seed, please proceed
You see these? with the with the long snake attached
To the eggs under a fruit with brown on that
With one eye, shoot out candy on contact
A lover not a fighter but trained for combat
Get Loose, fuck 1, fuck 2, fuck 3
Still in the house with a nigga Suga Free

[?: Verse 6]
Lets make it all make sense
Im taking the losses bosses all we move shit
If you can't keep up with traffic get your ass in the slow lane
Police got a habit of cracking niggas with no game
My life is too short to be supporting a broke hoe
So ya'll niggas really dont know

[Suga Free]
Ooh, you looking good now!
Turn around
You look good girl!
Turn around yeah

[Bridge]
Oooh, ooh, aah, aah
Oooh, ooh, aah, aah
Oooh, ooh, aah, aah
Oooh, ooh, aah, aah
