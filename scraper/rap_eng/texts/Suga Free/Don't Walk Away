[Verse One: Suga Free]
Now I done been through a world of shit
And you know
That I'm a pimp, before I break and make a mistake for you hoes
You told your story and I told you mine
But you lied
'Bout to get my pimp on cracking, but we fly
And furthermore I ain't got a dime
But you do
But don't give daddy his paper and watch what I do to you
You took my kindness for a weakness
Nah, nah, for a weakness
Pimp bone connected to my knee bone
Knee bone connect to my free bone
Free bone connect to my pee bone
Gimmie that pussy when he gone
I hurt your mind
I hurt your kind
But a pimp gon' close 'em up like some (ahh) vertical blinds
Bitch you just wanna go fuck somebody
But make sure you scrape that booger off your coat
Before it freeze up and cut somebody
Now that should get ya (that should get ya)
And when you in that line getting that WIC bitch
With that shit you get you can it wit ya

[Hook: James DeBarge + (Suga Free)]
Don't walk away
(Cause what's mine is mine
Uh huh, you come over here when I say something)
Don't walk away
(Now don't look down unless you see money on the ground
Bitch I told ya)
Don't walk away
(No, look at me bitch when I talk to you
Don't turn your back on me!)
Don't walk away
(Sit down! Come here!)

[Verse Two: Suga Free]
Stacking dolla dolla, why you B.S.ing?
Up in the Coupe with the Impala 'pala, why you B.S.ing?
Sometime it make me wanna holla holla "Why you B.S.ing?"
But that's my god and that's my father father why you B.S.ing?
Now, you
Got ta
Believe in you
See, see, I got to act up if I gotta make you believe in you
And I'll crack up making you believe in you
Take a deep breath
You can trip, just breathe, my body, yo' body
Nobody around us but eucalyptus trees
'Cause if ya down, and wanna get you paid
Remember we love surprises
Fuck drugs 'cause there's people out there getting turned out on Kool Aid
La di da di
Ha ha, we want your money not your body, bitch
I get you served like the mack I am
And my money be stanking but people don't give a damn
See, see, I
Asked her for her heart she said, "What for?"
I said, "Pay me."
She took off walking real fast yelling she gave it to the Lord save me!

[Hook (Repeat 2X)]
Don't walk away

[Verse Three: DJ Quik]
Now she be treating niggas so good
'Cause the hoe, she stay ready
Like Suga Free because he said she needs to give me 'bout 20 dubs
Well remember that time I had you coming in that skinny tub?
Now can you feel that?
With all that unnecessary noise you making
So your girlfriends can hear you bitch, you can kill that
'Cause when the ass be smacking
And the money be lacking
You think I'm goin' broke for you
Because of the way that you acting?
I be spending my life getting tipsy and blunted
Driving fast down the 5 getting head cause I want it
Trying to make enough paper so when I retire
I got a pile big enough to set the world on fire
See me cracking at bitch
Making her fetch
My dick around the room 'cause I'm making it stretch
And I defy you to make me stay
'Cause when I'm through with the whooping and getting dressed
You gon' be begging me...

[Hook (Repeat 4X)]
Don't walk away
