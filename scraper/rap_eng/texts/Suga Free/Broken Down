No. No. The name stays on
The name's got my daddy's blood on it
The name stays on. ... got my daddy's blood on it
The name stays on. She can have half of it

[DJ Quik]
I'm a give a hand gesture
The one that I make
When I give my thumb and other three fingers a break
You get the One
No, It's not random, it's not a mistake
You get the One, yeah

[Tweed Cadillac]
Man, ya'll rap cats funny
I'm Fred G. Sanford, y'all big ole dummies
And I ain't about to spit up on your verse
If you can't pull a little somethin' somethin' out your purse
I'm a vet, not a pet
So. Cal Intellect, grants me a much fatter check
So, oh shit! I'm back up in the booth again
This time, no looky-loos gettin' in
Please, see it ain't no reasonin'
You're bland, your pimpin' needs seasonin'
I'm one of the best from the West (Tweed Cadillac, baby!)
My name's still tatted on my ex-wife's chest
And I don't have Jungle Fever
Neither do I need a rapper rapping with me either
Ya best realize who you're dealing with
I'm on some 9-3-point Tweed Cadillac

[Chorus]
I don't understand y'all niggas
And I know y'all don't understand me
But if I have to clown y'all niggas just to light a little fire
Well, I guess that's just what it's gon' have to be
Ya see, I don't comprehend y'all suckas
Opinionated, you're dumb and you're OG
You couldn't keep up with the city so you move out to the desert
And you wanna blame your drama on me
Keep it Broken Down

[Suga Free]
You see the gift
Now find the gab
To each it's reach
If I don't cop, it ain't mine to have
I'm tryin' to be as clean as a Stacy be
But in the back of my mind, I'm like "get the fuck away from me"
Why do you want to try to stress a muthafucka?
If I throw you a P at you, nigga, catch the muthafucka
Here's the dearly, and there's the departed
The only time I like to fuck you is when I'm off that narcotic
You know I'm no good
I get my money in the hood
Tattoo

[Quik]
Oh yeah

[Suga Free]
Hey Quik! Blow a trick out
Ain't it fucked up when a bitch coughs while your fucking and spits your dick out?

[Quik]
Money

[Suga Free]
Give me moreâ€”no, Quik, I'm serious
Ain't that the same nigga that choked a bitch out with a gray unicorn?
Holy fish scale!
You mean to tell me, you'd rather save this bitch than save this whale?
It's mighty skeptical
Quik, man, all these years and you ain't gave me a Pee
Nah, I'm talkin' about the vegetable
And she knows it's me when I'm pullin' up
'Cause my car goes Vroom Vroom
And her daddy's easy to talk to because the whole conversation be Um-hmm
Now buckle down for the backlash
Why they call DJ Quik DJ Quik? ... that fast!

[Chorus]
I don't understand y'all niggas
And I know y'all don't understand me
But if I have to clown y'all niggas just to light a little fire
Well, I guess that's just what it's gon' have to be
Ya see, I don't comprehend y'all suckas
Opinionated, you're dumb and you're OG
You couldn't keep up with the city so you move out to the desert
And you wanna blame your drama on me
Keep it Broken Down

[DJ Quik]
You niggas buyin' meth, I'm buyin' cookware
I'm tired of being a muthafuckin' pall-bearer
I think I'd rather be Geraldo Rivera
And tell the people what's really going on with you squares
How could I lose my identity?
How could we become our own worst enemy?
Even at the park, we don't party whatever
Not familiar because we're barely hardly together
Cyber gangbangers, Internet gimmicks
How did all my fans get replaced with critics?
Went to sleep and woke up in a world full of limits
And being humble is synonomous with being timid
Niggas annoy me, so I frighten them
They stalk and hunt me down, 'til I enlighten them
And then they sex play me, sounding fruity
When you call me bitch ass nigga
Is that a female dog shaped booty?

[Chorus]
I don't understand y'all niggas
And I know y'all don't understand me
But if I have to clown y'all niggas just to light a little fire
Well, I guess that's just what it's gon' have to be
Ya see, I don't comprehend y'all suckas
Opinionated, you're dumb and you're OG
You couldn't keep up with the city so you move out to the desert
And you wanna blame your drama on me
Keep it Broken Down
