[Suga Free: Verse 1]
Now do you really wanna see a pimp pick a beat with a little bitty dayton spoke
Jump inside the glass house heifer what you waiting for? Get in, throw the money on the floor
Hey who them niggas in the caddillac? I don't know
Now game recognize game every way I walk
And if I hit the slub station nigga I don’t talk
I ain't a rap star, nigga I'm a pimp on the street
And you could ask any real nigga that you meet
And they’ll say

[Chorus]
He's Pimpin' and She Hoein'
They going round and round the world ways knowing
Going round and round until the tricks fell down
Took the money out the pocket can I get a sound round

[Cash Flow: Verse 2]
Suga Free Why U Bullshittin'?
Fast lane on the track dropping skits
Got a motherfucker trippin and the whole club bouncing to this
West east coast dirty south and the west coast rock to this
All the suckers better recognize
People better side laneway with ya every night
Wreck a straight trick hollar baack
While the hoes in the club scream "nickle for a dollar sack"

[Chorus]
He's Pimpin' and She Hoein'
They going round and round the world ways knowing
Going round and round until the tricks fell down
Took the money out the pocket can I get a sound round

[Suga Free: Verse 3]
It really stings don’t it? Uhh huh
It ain’t no good if it ain't good enough to put the proper tpimpin on it
Bitch you’s a hoe probably die a hoe what yo momma hating for?
What you tryna play me for?
Baby what you take me for?
There's not a problem that I can't fix, Uhh uhh
Cuz I can fix it pimpin a bitch
And when I hit the hoe stroll
When the cadialllac pumpin smokey robinson drinking some drank
They got my name in they mouths straight snithced
I'm tired of ordinary niggas tryna take all ya’ll bitches
They don't feel shit, why don't you tell yo momma take that tattoo and give it to a real bitch
And tell your momma that she got the wrong taste
Because she got you looking for a sucker in the wrong place
No dick, no dick, no dick......

[Chorus]
He's Pimpin' and She Hoein'
They going round and round the world ways knowing
Going round and round until the tricks fell down
Took the money out the pocket can I get a sound round
