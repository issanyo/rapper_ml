God told me his-self! No one who has informed against me shall prosper! Bitch that mean you! yo evil ass momma!
Her momma, her mommas momma! (haha hold on, let me tell you something)
Forever? Forever-ever!?

[Verse 1: Suga Free]
Bitch, who you trying to act a fool with?
I pack my own bags, got my own bowling ball, and my own pool-stick
I live in Big bear bitch, right in the snout
Like that motherfucker, I know you know!
Come up there and get to trippin!...
You gon' hear that pat-tat-tat-tat-tat and oooh that!
I took them kids, and I raised them up!

[Chorus, Suga Free]
I don't give a fuck about a bitch
Nigga you can have that bitch

[Verse 2: Suga Free]
Yo, yacka packa, stop sign, green light, yellow light, in the tray, dipping down in the morning, over night
I ain't scared of you nigga
You know Black Tone?
The motherfucker turned around and leave me alone
Nigga, I ain't scared when I'm home alone
I got a tech 9 nigga, it go straight to ya dome
From your knee bone, to your ankle bone, to your shoulder bone, to the hell no
Nigga, Suga Free for the rucker
Never hesitating to check her!

[Chorus, Suga Free]
I don't give a fuck about a bitch

God said one day you gon' leave me alone
And bitch you know im parole so I can't go to ya dome

Twin towers is full

Kicking back like that he on the game He on the trigger
Big pimpin
Puntang was plenty, weed, smoke, don't need no more sheeit
She in my house with her friends buckin on me

She said: "No."
I said: "That's why she gon' need you, keep fuckin' with me!"
Gift of "Gab gab gab"

Gleek gleek, Suga Free pivot like an E. Q
Turn her down!

Every motherfuckin' time, I told you not to do it

[Chorus, Suga Free]
I don't give a fuck about a bitch
Nigga you can have that bitch
Ol' nappy head bitch
Bitch, I'm tryna get rich
Nigga I don't care about that bitch
You can have that bitch nigga
Just quit talking about the bitch nigga

[Verse 3: Suga Free]
Bitch I don't need to use you

My momma said: "Dejuan why you talk about women like that?"
I said: "Cuz a bitch took my son from me and didn't bring me back."
So this for you, fuck you, your momma your grandmomma and her momma, and her momma's momma too, shit
So when you get to hell, tell them Suga Free sent you
Bitch, I'm going my own way, and I don't want to be with you
And what don't you do?
Bitch I mean if you have a good dream, bitch I want them too
But you too two-faced to talk about it
Oooh gotta get up and take a walk about it
But I'm fly ya'll
Ain't nothing like a pool-stick to the head, sound it off
Heyyyyahhh

[Chorus, Suga Free]
I don't give a fuck about a bitch
Nigga you can have that bitch
Ol' nappy head bitch
Bitch, I'm tryna get rich
Nigga I don't care about that bitch
You can have that bitch nigga
Just quit talking about the bitch nigga
Fuck that bitch
