Good evening, I'm Suga Free and you
I don't know who the fuck you man
But I'ma tell you like this, ain't no tricks livin' here
Ain't not suckas livin' here, ain't no punk ass hoes livin' here

'Cause you see baby we about to get paid
And baby we about gettin' ours the right way and the real way
You waste my time, I waste your time
You lie to me, I lie to you, fifty fifty thang right
So this is the gospel, Suga Frees gospel, street gospel
