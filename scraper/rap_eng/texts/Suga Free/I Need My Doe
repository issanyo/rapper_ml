I ain't playing with these niggas anymore man... tightest P spitting on the West Coast nigga

[Suga Free: Verse 1]
You motherfuckers need to know I don't need your respect
Not what I pimp or die for
Suga Suga Free Free and I'm one of the best
From Louis-is-is cuz
I mind my wants because I know somebody wants my mind
"Many are called but few are chosen"
Who the fuck, Who the fuck, Who the fuck, Who the fuck, Who the fuck, you talking to
Never talk down on a playa, fuck you too
Playa haters need to go somewhere and get you some game
Because its only on them not in them
You playa haters make me laugh until I cry and get sick
But without Suga Free you wouldn't be shit
You lied to me every little chance that you get
And I don't give a fuck if you don't want to see me with a grip

[Verse 2]
Yo
Now, if I hang around nine broke niggas on the strip
I'll never have nothing to show for
And make a nigga want to stick a needle deep in his veins
Might as well gone and go for it
But I gotta stay strong for my daughters and son
I can hear them say "Daddy be strong for me"
So I keep it cracka lacking like I'm happy when I'm not
Its the tears of a clown, you gone boy
Now I wish a motherfucker would come test me
I would light that ass up like the West was one right in front of me
Now I think her momma didn't hug her when she was a kid
Motherfucker step back cuz Suga Free did
And I don't want to catch a case and break my nails on this hoe
Talking shit cuz I'm Suga Free the pimp you know
I ought to, I ought to, I ought to, haul off and kick your ass
Wait a minute, bitch get your ass up right now and go get my cash
She used to let the little boys look up under her dress
Oh you little hoe you
Now she fucking with a pimp cuz she don't like free sex
Now go get it like daddy told you

[Verse 3]
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute!
Suga Free don't fuck with square bitches, there's a difference
And baby Why U Bullshittin'?
This is pimpin (hee hee)
I check my traps but I never do I let my traps check me
Look baby I got something to prove here
The sizteenth letter made is the capital P
Oooh la la la, baby how do you do dear?
I check a bitch like Donald Trump checked Rosanne
And I'll do it again if I have to
And now you know it ain't in me to show no woman no respect
Before I do I'll beat her ass like the champ and break her neck
And let the bitch get bold and get to woofing in my house
This old pimp I'm gonna turn around and knock her ass out

[Bridge]
YEAH
Put a "P" on that
No one who has informed against me shall prosper
And every time they rise against me they shall fail
You have just witnessed the tightest most prolific spitter on the west coast, yeah nigga
Yeah it wasn't my fault when I was a baby I feel in a box of glitter and I been shining ever since yeah

[Verse 4]
You mothercfuckers better get your money every day
And do it right the first time
And make her stay in pocket pimping so she do what you say
Suga Suga let them know that its church time
She learned to rub her pussy way before she learned to tell a lie
Oh you little slut you
Hahahaha
I like the way that sounds say it again
Oh you little slut you
