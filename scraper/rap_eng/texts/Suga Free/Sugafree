[Verse 1]
Let's make-believe you really like me (Ha)
And lets play you listen to me the first time I tell you something and don't repeat myself twice see?
See I don't have that kind of time to waste
I'd fuck around and be an old as man before I get my taste
I see these niggas yelling at bitches so loud they voice go hoarse
Just for a couple a hundred of dollars?
What an uncomfortable course!
Let's make-believe you ain't so hard headed
And play like you know
Like you ain't dumb
Like you intelligent
My fantasy hoe
Bitch lets pretend nobody telling me you out of pocket and shit lets make-believe i really love you and I need you bitch
See it will be good to see you go to work on time YOURSELF
Won't have to tell you what to do like I do everybody else
Do I really have to remind you about what time I eat?
Or have my towel and my underclothes when I shower baby?
Seem like the Older I get, the more I look for perfection
I'm Suga Free bitch and I ain't scared of rejection

[Chorus]
I'm Suga Free
When the dog's away the cat gon' play
I'll tell you that right now
I'm Suga Free
Pimp can't pimp unless he pimp
And gon' be able to pimp his-self
I'm Suga Free
Keeping our head above water
I'm Suga Free
Making a way when we can

[Verse 2]
Okay lets pretend like I don't worry about you nothing when you turning them tricks
Like when you don't call me and check in with me when I tell you bitch
I ain't gon lie
Sometimes your attitude makes me wanna throw you on the couch, slap yo ass pull your hair and stick my dick in your mouth
Lets pretend yo momma like me and she don't talk that shit
And she believe you when you told her that your step-daddy hit
And he didn't tell you if you told yo momma what happned that he was killing both of ya'll
Yeah, I'm telling you what's happening
Lets pretend like you didn't get molested by your own blood and that your momma didn't beat you and wasn't hooked on drugs
You make people say "how could she stand on the corner like that?"
They just don't know what you went through to make you walk that track
She feel love for a minute, satisfying you trick
But she can be colder whatever cold than cold can get
Stevicious did the beat and Nemo hooked it up
Da-Moo came with the herb and now i'm sugaring it up

[Chorus]
I'm Suga Free
When the dog's away the cat gon' play
I'll tell you that right now
I'm Suga Free
Pimp can't pimp unless he pimp
And gon' be able to pimp his-self
I'm Suga Free
Keeping our head above water
I'm Suga Free
Making a way when we can

[Verse 3]
Now lets play like you really know me
To where you can predict my every move
Like when I smoke choke and go over to the track
Mack and get her to choose
You a good pimp and don't play if she stay
Play, nigga I took my radio out my car cuz it play
Lets act like we don't know the truth
Doing boyfriend girlfriend stuff
Holding hands kicking cans
Fuck some money and stuff
Who cares if you be out of pocket staring niggas and shit?
Leave the house and don't come back until its 10 to 6
You wanna control me like I'm nothing
Can't think for myself
I'm telling you right now bitch
You think I'm somebody else?
Lets make believe I don't care about nothing you do
Say you love me?
Bitch give me some money and I say I love you too
This ain't no relationship where you say in one spot too long
Cuz she a hoe, she gon set the spot if he hot too long
And nigga don't act like that shit don't hurt
When she walk on the track
The old man said "Don't change the locks she'll be back!"

[Chorus]
I'm Suga Free
When the dog's away the cat gon' play
I'll tell you that right now
I'm Suga Free
Pimp can't pimp unless he pimp
And gon' be able to pimp his-self
I'm Suga Free
Keeping our head above water
I'm Suga Free
Making a way when we can
