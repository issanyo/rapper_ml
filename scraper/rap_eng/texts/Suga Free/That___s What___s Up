Better get that money lady…

[Verse 1]
Thank God, it's friday and I’m feeling myself
Like you wouldn't if you was me or something I'm nobody else
So shake that ass like it will pay you rent
You better get that money like its mandatory for this
You think I’m playing? Meet me in the VIP for a chat
I whispered “pimpin” in her ear now she know how to act
Shake that body like you know you wanna shake that body baby
You a freak and you a star
You want this money? take the car
And That's What's Up
I'm Suga Free the Pimp, a king, That's What's Up
Watch how you look at me and what you say
That's What's Up
Suga Suga Free Free big ol’ pimp
Don’t play me like that baby
Better try to control Him, there's plenty of you ladies
Like its “your turn,” “your turn,” “your turn,”
Now arch your back and juggle that
And I don’t even know her
But that's what makes it sexy cause it's spur of the moment
Two wild animals in the dark, in the club, I want it

[Hook]

Run up on me wrong and I'm a Show you What's Up
All these ladies in the club got lust in they eyes
And wanna chiropractor her back and tell her some lies
