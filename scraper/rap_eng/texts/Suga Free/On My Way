[Verse 1]
Okay baby, you sayin' that to say what?
Uhh uhh, that's drama, no nah
You done picked that shit up from yo' momma
Now I ain't
Finna to break no finger nail going "oops" upside yo head
Yeah, I love you baby, but not like that
Yo' love ain't never paid my bills or put no clothes on my back
Wait, "what do you see," said the blind man
Who heard the deaf man say he saw Suga Free just drop the bomb and it went "boo yah"
Then when I am feeling them year 2025 feelings
I move, in a real way
Sometimes I like a nice hot, proper, hairy head full of sweat from sex
On the couch first
And when it starts feeling good, you always stop saying
"Ughhh, my m-m-mouth hurt!" And them chil'run
Baby got kids so bad they'll piss you off to the highest level of pissitivity, running they mouth smelling like urine
Don't hurt the pimpin baby
What we don't know each other any more because instead of a girlfriend I'd rather have a hoe
You won't catch me holding hands, kicking cans, walking a tightrope saying "she loves me, she loves me not" man

[Chorus]
I can be on my way, on my way, on my way babe
(I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help me God)
I can be on my way, on my way, on my way babe
(Because the name of the game is cop and blow)
I can be on my way, on my way, on my way babe
(this time, don't leave nothing so you don't have to come back and get it)
I can be on my way, on my way, on my way babe
(Yeah, I know thats you callin and hangin up. Putting 187 in the pager)

[Verse 2]
Wait, no who the hell you talkin to?
Always crying about what I do and don't do for you
Now thats your problem always bringing up the past
If I wasn't on parole I woulda kicked yo ass
Cuz you lookin for a sucker in the
Wrong place
You don't know it but a playa gets
Lonely
But that don't mean I have to act so
Phoney
Because all you got to offer your
Punanny
Uhh uhh, nah
What you got yo hands in my face for?
Oh, you doin too much
Wronger than two left shoes, but you don't know
And I gotta get (gotta get)
Out your house cuz I be hungry
And all you got is one potato with roots growing out of it
I'm 24 right
But in dog years let me see
For every one human year that's seven years for a dog
Follow me
So seven times twenty four - wait
Seven times four is twenty eight
Carry the two, alright I got the figure
I'm one hundred and sixty eight
And its a shame that we can't do lunch
Cuz you get all riled up until I say
"Baby don't get your panties in a bunch"
And just like jolly rancher candy
The same way I peel of that plastic wrapper
Is the same way I pulled of babies panties

[Chorus]
I can be on my way, on my way, on my way babe
(No, no, give me them keys, you leaving in a cab today baby)
I can be on my way, on my way, on my way babe
(No, no, don't go looking up in that closet, because you don't got nothing up in there)
I can be on my way, on my way, on my way babe
(Yeah don't be calling my Momma house pestering everybody either!)
I can be on my way, on my way, on my way babe
(Uhh, uhh, nah... I see my son when - Don't be poppin up over here!)
I can be on my way, on my way, on my way babe
(Where way? Take of that watch, that necklace, them rings, that belongs to her now)
I can be on my way, on my way, on my way babe
(Oh, and before you go quit blowing up my pager with 911 just to see what I'm doing)
I can be on my way, on my way, on my way babe
I can be on my way, on my way, on my way babe
