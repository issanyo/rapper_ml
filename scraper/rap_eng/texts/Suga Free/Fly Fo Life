Fly for life, this life is mine, willin to die..
Don't cost a dime to stay out of mine, not a dime..
Indica thai, makin me high, you wanna try?

Up up and away, sunshine, blue skies, fly
And I see orange stars, green clovers, and blue diamonds
Feelin nutritious!
Makin love to my, beotches, beat it
You ain't gonna make no puss I done sewed her up
Get my money type pimp player ?? ?? are we? (No) Cool
Now I reside in Pomona
I got some bitches on the corner
My baby momma with em too
Cause I'm a motherfuckin fool (Whassup Suga Free?)
The price of pussy baby
The price of pussy babyyyyyyyy!

[?? - not listed]
?? ?? buddies hangin with you while I'm shakin em
And everything they say has got to do with you not takin em
Just hear me when you work out all your problems with your friends
Cause life is gettin short and see I'm all about my yen
The Westside of Pomona is the city where it's happenin
City of sin, and I miss them days back on Jacqueline
Still it was the state of mind don't think that we be playin
Tres Cinco Siete no cuerte, you know what I'm sayin
The method of detectin niggas all up in yo' game
Can never be done, if you continue to remain
A victim in life, for the fact that love don't love nobody
I shoulda been this numb back in the days of O.G. Chotty(?)
Sayin..

[Unlisted singer]
Oooh, you can run away from a playa but you can't hide

[Suga Free]
No you can't hide from yo'self
Because everywhere you go, there you are

[Unlisted singer]
Oooh, you can run but there's no places left to hide

[Suga Free]
And kiss my pimpin ASS
Cause some of y'all niggas be KILLIN me!
Fly for life, this life is mine, willin to die.. (fly for life)
Don't cost a dime to stay out of mine, not a dime..
(not a got damn dime)
Indica thai, makin me high, you wanna try? (Yeah)

Strange weeds in the garden, bird pickin up seed killed game
Here come a passion mark, jealous playa hat'n lame
And he's slippin like a bad transmission too
Givin bitches his money, now do that sound like you?
They say money don't ?? and it's hard to make
I think about it everytime I bump a bitch to break
You couldn't pay me no money to respect a bitch
Fall in love, get married, and watch her take half my shit
But you a gangsta - yeah you hard as fuck!
A straight killa to your homies but that pussy got you stuck
I got game - somethin you stuck on
I want some money but you wanna get your fuck on, trick
Shoot a nigga cause he from the other side of the street
But scared to let yo' bitch go out, cause yo' game is weak
Now how your money want my honey?
So how your money want my ho?
Cause youse a gangsta, liquor, sucker, fucker
Teaser, pleaser, slap her, tap her
In the back of her, the bed, the flow that's yo' ho
On the couch, in her mouth, check it out, her gut
Her butt, so rough, so tough, mmmmm
Bust a nut get up and pimp or shut the fuck up
Now what you gon' be nigga
Part of the problem or part of the solution?
A paper institution, see the institution upon seducin
Y'all know that nigga that be turf talkin that old ying-yang
Killin me with that buh-bullshit, don't be wantin a damn thang
Now correct me if I'm wrong; I love my money
Myself my weed but anything else can get the fuck on!

Fly for life, this life is mine, willin to die.. (fly for life)
Don't cost a dime to stay out of mine, not a dime..
(not a got damn dime)
Indica thai, makin me high, you wanna try? (Yeah)

I heard a bitch say if you hit a bitch then youse a bitch yourself
I said
"Then call me Dwana bitch and I'll beat that bitch to death playa"
I see you got that nigga pussy-whipped, with that pussy grip
On that pussy trip, starin at your pussy lip
You say you got too much pride to ho
Bitch if push come to shove, you'd be ready to go
Uh-oh, here come push and now go shove in the front and back
Tre' can-dy paint great with goldies on brand new dubs
Ready to kidnap that brain with that game
That I got from Tony Lang(?), Ernest Lang(?) and Jermaine
Black tone's my backbone when ass gone my jawbone will be gone
My knee-bone will be to my ankle bone
Ay Tony Lang(?) you better tell em
Get ready to tell this nigga a joke or somethin
Man cause I'mma overwhelm him
Them jealous niggas don't believe us
So I'mma wreck the microphone and (?) between the Devil and Jesus
And I, tip-toe, to Top Hat Liquor sto'
To buy some drank and zig-zags for this dank - see
The very same winos, beggin for change
Gettin drunk, tellin lies, just the same ol' thang
Now I'm rollin down ?? in the lane, by the curb
Pushin Fosgate Alpine woofers with reverb
My homey Lil' Man, Loco Y, Crazy D
Lil' Shamu from Sin-town, Doo G Greg(?) and O.G. Down Down
As I take you face to face to a place
That takes the place of all place to place, I rest my case

Fly for life, this life is mine, willin to die.. (fly for life)
Don't cost a dime to stay out of mine, not a dime..
(not a got damn dime)
Indica thai, makin me high, you wanna try? (Yeah)
Fly for life, fly for life, fly for life! (Fly for life)
Ahhh..
