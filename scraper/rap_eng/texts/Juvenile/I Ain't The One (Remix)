Girl, you looking for a Hot Boy ha, ghetto rough ha
You wanna see how it is to have me tossin' you up ha
Look, I'm 5' 11", bull legged, skinny, you get it and
Now settle down and let Juvie handle his bidness and
Turn it over, tune it up, let me hit that

You with that nigga, ha
Playin' games, askin' for change
'Round my people sayin' your name
