[Intro: Juvenile]
Them Hot Boys out here, ya heard me?
The B.G., headbussin' Moe, fa sho
Bout to make it happen
Magnolia bout that gafflin'
Valence & Magnolia

[Verse 1: Juvenile]
I'm in the jungle, of niggas that's lookin' for static
Two niggas stuck and jackin' just to support his habit
Them people rollin', so I gotta do what I can
I gotta pound of that sand I picked up from the man
The luxuries I gotta have it, black savage
He's in the streets holdin' up traffic
With the plastic, Desert Eagle .45 automatic
My glass is, filled with J.D. and coca-cola classic
And niggas that playa-hate I got somethin' for yo asses
I'ma act a donkey, boy you best not run up on me
You niggas phony, that's why I did that to your homie
For instance, when the Mac-9 will erase your existence
So distance, yourself from me 'cause my conscience be clickin'
Niggas be paranoid when they see I be dippin'
Sayin', man let me go, he bout to stomp on that trigger
Somebodies wig get split in the middle of the street
I got your brains to show you bitches, stop playin' with me
And ain't no thing I got my Ruger and I ain't' scared to die
Cross that line and I'ma shoot'cha and tell your Mommy bye-bye
Hungry for money, like vampires hungry for blood
Better get to runnin', solja reeboks is in the mud

[Chorus: Turk]
Phase, a blast of foolishness went through his head
With a strap hollerin' "Nigga what you said?"
That iron again is mine right? Snatchin' for a kidnap
People out that project say Juvenile you did that?
That iron again is mine right? Snatchin' for a kidnap
People out that project say Juvenile you did that?
Man, Juvenile you did that...

[Verse 2: Big Moe]
Don't get caught up fools, in the wrong way
'Cause them niggas out that Lio stay totin' them A.K.'s
The baddest trigga happy niggas I ever saw
Calliope niggas play the muthafuckin' game raw
So don't get'cha self in a jam
'Cause these niggas I hang with really don't give a damn
With the quickness, nigga they put them K's to use
Niggas like Wango, Wine, Spig, and my boy Deuce
So any nigga want some drama get strapped
So I can put your bitch ass in my Rest In Peace rap
'Cause dead, yeah, is what'cha gonna be
If you fuck with this nigga from that C-P 3,
So don't be fuckin' with me
'Cause you'll be lookin' down the barrel of a nine double M, homie
And with a nigga like me, holdin' the gat
I'mma pull the fuckin' trigger and bust ya head to the fat
Then watch your brain run down the city drain
And after that, leave the spot 'cause Frank Mignon's comin' to get the remains
So all you gangsta ass niggas tilt your hat
And plus that bullshit y'all niggas out here are tryin' to do?
I fuckin' been there and done that

[Chorus: Turk]
Phase, a blast of foolishness went through his head
With a strap hollerin' "Nigga what you said?"
That iron again is mine right? Snatchin' for a kidnap
People out that project say Big Moe you did that?
That iron again is mine right? Snatchin' for a kidnap
People out that project say Big Moe you did that?

[Verse 3: B.G.]
Don't make me pull my pistol nigga, 'cause fa-shiggidy I'ma use it
This life you strugglin' through you gone lose it
I come through actin' foolish, with semi-automatics
Shit get hectic, blast, or get blasted
I'ma a Baby Gangsta bout drama, bout buckin'
Full of that dustin', you bust, I'm bustin'
You shoot, I shoot
You miss, I hit
Hot Boy representin' that gangsta shit
Stop playin' with the young soldier, believe
You jeopardizin' what's on your shoulder, you shoot at me
Take it to the streets, you ain't bout that action
Packin' two twenty-three's, sweepers knock you off your feet
St. Thomas still got them bags for twenty-five
Before I go on the pride, I'm full of that Worldwide
Goin' for crime I'll spank them, can't swim with the sharks
Through this water, muthafucka I'll spank'em
Get'cha mind right, nigga, fuckin' with me
Think twice I tote iron I'ma a true B.G.,
Fuckin' right, I split hats, and I tote Mac's
I be fuckin' with silver packs, now what you know about that?
Got the all black fit, ready to put in work
But niggas actin' like jerks, I put dicks in the dirt
I run with Juvenile, 'cause he's a gangsta ass nigga
Niggas huntin' like they bout it, but I'll spank that ass nigga
So who wants some beef? Let me show you I don't play
Told ya I'm that type that'll hit'cha block everyday
If you're real, you'll bust back
But if you fake, I got'cha Ma & them in all-black
It's no escape, I did that

[Chorus: Turk]
Phase, a blast of foolishness went through his head
With a strap hollerin' "Nigga what you said?"
That iron again is mine right? Snatchin' for a kidnap
People out that project say B.G. you did that?
That iron again is mine right? Snatchin' for a kidnap
People out that project say B.G. you did that?
Man, Juvenile you did that...
