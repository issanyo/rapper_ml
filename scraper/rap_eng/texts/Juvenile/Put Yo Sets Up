(This how we do)
Aiy ya'll haters thought we weren't comin back wit' a remix huh?
But we did it again, ya, ya heards
So we gon' take this one here ta the dance flo'
We got my homegirl Slanted Eyezz in here
And my self, Redd-iggity, and my dawg, Juvenile-niggity
Aiy Juve show 'em dawg

[Juvenile]
It's time ta buck on 'em nigga on a night ta rain
Everything ain't all gravy, but I can't complain
Fuck the bullshit I wanna get paid fa' real
Not no pennies either I want me a major deal
I mean forty, sixty, eighty mil'
Money like a nigga in the NBA wit' skills, Whoa!
And Zoe gon' blow, then you gon' blow
And you can't buy just one, you gon' wan' mo'
Reppin' that Nolia, claimin' them Soljahs
Come through bustin' wit' Happy and Hola
My niggas gon' feel me if they raisin' they guts
My women gon' feel me if they laid in the cut
Wat'chu holdin' that weed fa' blaze the bitch up
If you runnin' out of liquor, nigga fill up ya cup
It's Redd-iggity, and Juvenile-niggity
And we came here ta get this bitch off the higgity

[*Hook - Juvenile + (Slanted Eyezz)*]
Representin' where you from shouldn't be that hard
Put yo sets in the air, let me see ya'll boys
All my good pussy women, if ya fucks wit' me
It should be that fuckin' hard ta throw it up wit' me (Put, yo, sets, up)
Where ya from muthafucka where ya from
Put yo sets up  (Where ya from)
Where ya from muthafucka where ya from
Put yo sets up in the air (Where ya from)
Where ya from muthafucka where ya from
Put yo sets up (Where ya from)
Now Raise 'em up, Raise 'em up (Where ya from)

It's the city of pretty women, ass shakin' in tight denim
The clubs be thick, pick a chick, bet I can bent 'em
My click, big spendin' in the V.I.P
Our hoes, Get, Frea, - Ky

[Slanted Eyezz]
These niggas cling ta my ass, they see a jazzy bitch

In the cut V.I.P. Eyezz roll in this bitch
Got Juve ta my right, wit' a couple ounce and a splif

[Redd Eyezz]
Now if that pussy good, let me see you bounce ta this shit
We drink Belvy-thuggin'-twistin' and smoke a ounces of cryp
Put yo sets up, like yo hood drownin' and shit

[Slanted Eyezz]
See I'm a good pussy bitch, you can't go wrong wit' me
And if it's a hotter miss, I'm still waitin' ta see

Whether I be talkin' slick, or we under the covers

Wind yo waist ta the beat while I grab on ya butt
Look, it's Redd-iggity and Juvenile-niggity
And we came here ta get this bitch off the higgity
