And you was thinking I would never come back
And I was all the way off of my mack
I bounce back on you boys like that, like that, like that
And now that everything is back on track
Bitch I’ma do it real big like shaq
Cuz you ain’t seen the last scene of my act, my act, my act
Light, camera, action (x3)
Independent is this business ain’t my way of livin’
I got a family to support I ain’t just Hair? Driven
I did a 5 last year now I’m a need a 6
I’m a gangster all my life a Tarentino flick
Ain’t no sugar in water here ain’t no cinnebon
And I can see through a pussy ngas like ______?
I’m on top of the moment that’s where I plan to stay
I move that devil food, used to move that angel cake
I get that money, turn it over _____?
You fuckin wit me I’m waging you with this lavish style
And if you wanna know where I get it from
Camouflage wild magnolia, ya we get it done
And you was thinking I would never come back
And I was all the way off of my mack
I bounce back on you boys like that, like that, like that
And now that everything is back on track
Bitch I’ma do it real big like shaq
Cuz you ain’t seen the last scene of my act, my act, my act
Light, camera, action (x3)
Bitch out of water’s like the re-birth
I’ve been committed let data follow your research
They holla back when a G come through
Ngas left their marks I’ma leave one too
In my I touch chuck? and my Dr. Dre headphones
In my future lookin pretty like a red bone
I hear they talking that it’s over but they dead wrong
I’ll let my borrow money, dead broke day’s gone
Call the cops bout’ to be another murder case
Cuz I be usin my words on em like .38s
I’m Master P’in this, it’s my body, body take
Now that I’m back I gotta get it ain’t nobody safe
And you was thinking I would never come back
And I was all the way off of my mack
I bounce back on you boys like that, like that, like that
And now that everything is back on track
Bitch I’ma do it real big like shaq
Cuz you ain’t seen the last scene of my act, my act, my act
Light, camera, action (x3)
