[Intro: Juvenile]
Suga Slim, Million Dollar spot
Whodie

[Verse 1: Juvenile]
Ask them motherfuckers how the CMB play it
Tanqueray and Alize it, take the llello and weigh it
735's I drive, fits to match
When I pass, bitches ask, "Who the fuck was that?"
Girl that's Juvenile, you don't know he on fire
17-inch momos, black magic on his tires
Crushed out stones, plushed out homes
Cellular phones and concerts in the Superdome
Now I can park my Beamer, and play the Navigator
Sport tailor made outfits with matching alligators
Visa gold, bank account on swole
Got my million dollar destiny under control
Millions a fantasy, Juvenile's reality
Bitch I write my own checks, bitch I pay my own salary
You want business with me
Boss playa ya have to be
I'm a million dollar nigga, these bitches run after me
I got a gold and chrome Beretta
I got a 1997 Mercedes compressor
And I can bet a hundred G's that my pockets won't hurt
Nigga set for life nigga puttin' in work

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
All kinds of cars
Neighborhood superstars
Feared by many and loved by broads

[Verse 2: Baby]
Neighborhood superstar
Ridin' in these pretty cars
Uptown niggas livin' like movie stars
Flyin' to Tennessee, chillin' with Lil Jimmie
And transportin' coke back and forth to my city
Takin' flights, be in Las Vegas over night
Chillin' with Lo Jack
Sippin' on cognac
Goin' to casinos
Gamblin' with the young ninos
Losin' 20 Gs' worth of C-notes
Nigga I sold dope all my life
Turned a hundred Gs into two million over night
I guess cus I'm rich
These hoes say I'm a stuntin' bitch
Thats why I look at all these hoes like the ain't shit
But I'm a star
Bitch you can keep that gar
Give me the money and a brand new car
Livin' in eastover, dealin' big baller parties
Invitin' all the fuckin' female rovers
Ridin' in Lamborghini
Beaches, hoes and bikinis
Me and Fresh tag teamin'
Ridin' in convertible land rovers
Hoes be sweatin' cus of the mouth full of golds
Nigga ballin' out of control

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
All kinds of cars
Neighborhood superstars
Feared by many and loved by broads

[Verse 3: Mannie Fresh]
I come with TVs and VCRs in the cars
And I, pack a big dick down in the draws
I'm a neighborhood pepper boy
Platinum stepera boy
Rolls Royce of my choice, not a rapper boy
Young G, ridin' in a Humvee
Broads tellin' bitches, tellin' hoes, come see
20-inch rims, on Yokahama slims
Check the neck for the diamonds and the gems
Don't nobody got mo ends than me
Don't nobody drive a fuckin' Benz like me
I got a house in Cali, and a ranch in Texas
17 inches on a brand new Lexus
Picture project hoes dancin' on marble floors
Kissin' one nigga from his head to his toes
Who you wanna be like, Mannie or Mike?
How you gone shine, dark or bright
Cus these hoes be wishin' to ride in a '97 Expedition
When I pass I make 'em stop look and listen
For tryin' ta follow, the big body Impala
Don't love 'em, don't need 'em, bitch sorry can't holla

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me what kinda
Nigga got diamonds that'll *bling* blind ya
I'm only 14 I'm a Big Tymer
I'm sittin' on chrome, all week shiner
My 'bauds hang low, crystal on the flo'
I'mma flex, twenty thousand dollar Rolex
I got my name on a street up in every city
And look everywhere I be I got a mirror with me
Look I'm feared by many, loved by broads
I'm living marvelous, I'm a superstar (superstar)

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
All kinds of cars
Neighborhood superstars
Feared by many and loved by broads
