You'll be up the whole night staring in the ice box

Elephants in the room, pretty with plenty goons
Flip the script with direct shots like Beanie Boom

Little Compton ass nigga with the vicious flow

Tell these straight things I'm about, I'm about riches and bitches
I'm about being the sickest, cause niggas know I'm the realest
Suzzie on the beat he knew I was gonna fill it
He knew I was gonna kill it, I whip chamber it with it
He put me against the best of MVP every time
They want these hot rhymes, they're killing in every line
These niggas rap good, but these niggas really lying
We're seeing these cash money, now niggas is big timing
We're fucking with my cash, man you're fucking with your life
I ain't saying I'm a thief, but a nigga fuck your wife
I'm riding like a cock, got these fans screaming outside
Got your bitch screaming, now she wanna fuck a jackpot
I got the gold chains huff back smart pack
Huff hatch smart swag and your bitch love that!
