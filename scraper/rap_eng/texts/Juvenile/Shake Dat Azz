[Verse 2]
Now when the sun goes down in the C.J. Peete,
I'ma hit the door, lookin' for me a H-O-E
The first bitch I see, I step to her quick
I'm tryin' to find a way that I can run up in her shit
Now she don't wanna have no conversation
She sayin' I'm beginning to be an aggravation
Called her boyfriend, he was comin' out the store
He walked up to me and confronted me about the ho
I said "Look here the bitch was standin' so I thought she didn't have a man"
"So let's get that an understanding"
He looked at me crazy, figured he could fake me
I reached in my draws and quickly grabbed the three eighty
Now he's another nigga gone
Lovin' these hoes, you fuck with me and now it's on

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' wrong, with bein' a Juvenile nigga
Ain't nothin' wrong, with bein' a Juvenile nigga
Ain't nothin' wrong, with bein' a Juvenile nigga
Ain't nothin' wrong, with bein' a Juvenile nigga
