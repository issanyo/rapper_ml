[Hook]
Nigga I got corns on my fingers, I'm a shooter
I pull in front your house and no put fire on a scooter
I go for women too, I shoot some holes in your medulas
You feel like you on fire bitch, I put you in a cooler

Let me run it down, if I ain't in the hood
I'm somewhere close around
I'm somewhere close around
I'm somewhere close around
And I don't run and hide
There's too much dope around
There's too much dope around
There's too much dope around

[Verse 1]
I'm the product of the gutter
Me, my mother, and my brother
Shit for me wasn't always butter
Struggled just like all the others
And my hand around my girl
And I hug her like a hobo
Finger fuck her til she bust a nut and turn another color
It's the P without no luggage
I ride Benz as you ride [?]
Bitch just asked me what's my budget
It all depends if you gon' suck it
I got stashes, I don't touch 'em
Niggas mad cause I don't trust 'em
Go on back and started stacking
Wasn't asking them for nothing
I got shovels for you devils
Have you running like the rebels
Over boulders never pebbles
So you niggas never settle
You a joke around the fellas
More like Abbott and Costella
Just like Smokey out in Friday
You like man let's stick together

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
So dirty they need a bath
Don't help me nigga, help the bear
I'm a sinner behind my dinner
Somebody call rev, I need a prayer
Nothing between us two but air
If it was something I wouldn't even care
Rest in peace cause I don't play fair
[?] watch your hair
Then I turn into that nigga that's a thuggish motherfucker
I don't mind ya then I shoot em
Partners, brothers, cousins, mothers
Eh I'm strapped up nigga now act up
You bucked up niggas get fucked up
Better back up before you get clapped up
Nigga talk tough so you get bust up
It's crunch time, fourth quarter, one minute left on the clock
One gun, two clips, I see a few of these niggas that won't pop
A few of these niggas I want shoot
A few of these bitches I don't like
A few of these bitches I want dead
I'm trying to kill them all in one night

[Hook]
