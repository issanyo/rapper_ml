[Chorus: Juvenile]
It's the one nobody likes with bad breath and saggy pants
Might bounce a little bit but see a gangsta don't dance
Hoes say I am mean I never give them a chance
But can't a nigga get a little head in advance
It's the one nobody likes with bad breath and saggy pants
Might bounce a little bit but see a gangsta don't dance
Hoes say I am mean I never give them a chance
But can't a nigga get a little head in advance

[Verse 1: Juvenile]
Maybe not probably don't even feel that way
How can you not what's under my waist is real I say
A yo my fire cracker pop like independence day
Them dick suckers long shoud have been in sentence may
I do a little something I got that cut to tie your thighs up
I'm not asthmatic I'm healthy and I could fuck
That teenage pussy I don't want so zip it up
And no satchatories having in here so catch a cut
Ohh how I love it when half your ass show
And you catch the side view it look like two elbows
And my dick stuck to my leg like velcro
Stop blocking and let them females go
If the hoes keep asking me up I got to stop her
I've been searching for me a lifipeepoper
I'm serious you should wanna fuck with me period
Because I'm a little bit more then just a lyricist

[Chorus: Juvenile]

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
This is to alisha, camren, roshon and don
If you fuck with pimp baby show me your thong
Get your big ass up hoe you know this your song
Big daddy gonna be smashing it till four in the morn
You doing them jeans yeah black you need to stop it
It look like you got a loaf of bread in your pocket
Should have followed you first ma and snatch you first
But when I'm drinking everyboady look like they got worth
I don't need to tell a woman what I'm worth
She gonna show me some affection when I raise my shirt
I ain't never bought a woman where I do my dirt
To a nice confined spot where I can lift that skirt
Hopefully she illegal with the head and all
Probably heard of my background and said I'm a dog
But I ain't about me baby it's about y'all
My fantasy is knocking four of y'all off

[Chorus]

Shake that ass mami
If you trying to get to juvenile pass him
I'm not telling to tell you to put your man in past tense
It is just a little tiny favor that I'm asking

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
Show me that poor shooter any way you throw it I'm gonna do ya
Just let wardy do this manever
All thow I'm from the sewer
I like having relations
I punch a bitch in the head for playing with my patience
I make a local hoe turn hashin had me at the station
They hating saying that I violated my probation
Theres a lot of kinky shit going up in the clubs
We be popping exctasy looking for woman to hug
I promised not to get you caught up in these drugs
Put this gun in your purse mami and roll with a thug
Your girlfriends always saying she ain't like that
Well hold that right there mami I will be right back

[Chorus]

Shake that ass mami
If you trying to get to juvenile pass him
I'm not telling to tell you to put your man in past tense
It is just a little tiny favor that I'm asking
Shake that ass mami
If you trying to get to juvenile pass him
I'm not telling to tell you to put your man in past tense
It is just a little tiny favor that I'm asking
