Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worth while
The precious moments are lost in the tide
You know your in your head it ain't what it seems
Just close your eyes and you can follow your dreams
Listen to your heart when you don't know what to do
Listen to your heart (I did this one for my son) and here it calling you
Listen to your heart hear the voices in your head
Listen to your heart, hear what it says

(Verse 1)
They about to see me up 'Cuffs up in the precinct
The police better be ready to beat me something decent
My furniture put out side before the lease end
They wouldn't mind if i was dead before 'da weekend
I'm Not an actor 'cause I don't know how to pretend
When everyone wants you dead, how 'can you keep friends?
Complaining to people "HOW I"AM GONNA FEED THEM?"
Talkin like they write my raps and i really need them
This is the testament of Ne-No
From pennies to quarters to dollars to C notes
The author of the book onto which he not be re wrote
Food for the thought, something for your ego
Make sure to keep yourself surrounded by the right people
Take advantage of all the things that life teach you
Every dawg gotta say we all equal
Follow your heart and get ready for your sequel

(Chorus)
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worth while
The precious moments are lost in the time
You know in your head that it ain't what it seems

Just close your eyes and you can follow your dreams
Listen to your heart when you don't know what to do
Listen to your heart when you hear it callin you
Listen to your heart hear the voices in your head
Listen to your heart hear what it says

(Verse 2)
You other cats betta wake up and focus
Cause we da only people having funerals if ya notice
And junior I'm Not tryin to put ya on the spot light
Just don't want ya caught in the chillin on the block life
Use an example of yo POPS life
Before you play the game you betta find out what the odds like
You gotta lot of street smarts and need the books to
Study your work and quit worryin what the cooks do
Were my sons at? Were my daughters at?
They got receivers out there we need quarterbacks
In this world everybody plays a part fam
If you confused just follow whats in your heart man

(Chorus)
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worth while
The precious moments are lost in the time
You know in your head that it ain't what it seems
Just close your eyes and you can follow your dreams
Listen to your heart WHOOOOOOOO
Listen to your heart WHOOOOOOOO
Listen to your heart WHOOOOOOOO
