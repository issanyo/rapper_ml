Throw that ass this way
Throw that ass this way
Throw that ass this way
Throw that ass this way

Drop that ass, drop that ass
Drop that, drop that, drop that ass
Drop that ass, drop that ass
Drop that, drop that, drop that ass

Hey, there's a lot of ho's at the party
But you the only one a nigga lookin' at, shawty
Hey, there's a lot of ho's at the party
But you the only one a nigga lookin' at, shawty

Whenever you shake it, you make a player smile
But I wonder if you could drop it hot potato style?
My holiday girl, my little Ms. Christmas
Can you excuse me for thinking with my dipstick?

I'm lovin' on you, you aren't hearin' that from any source
Messin' with you kinda feel like we havin' intercourse
Forget the talk, a nigga put this shit on autocheck
I had a fucked up day but you changin' all of that

I hope you're ready, we're partyin' 'til the next day
Now bend it over here and huddle up for the next play
You play the quarterback, I'ma participate
Hey, what you should be tryin' to do is throw it this a-way

Throw that ass this a-way
Throw that ass this a-way
Throw that ass this a-way
Throw that ass this a-way

Drop that ass, drop that ass
Drop that, drop that, drop that ass
Drop that ass, drop that ass
Drop that, drop that, drop that ass

Hey, there's a lot of ho's at the party
But you the only one a nigga lookin' at, shawty
Hey, there's a lot of ho's at the party
But you the only one a nigga lookin' at, shawty

It only just took me a glance, too
See you back it up like you graduated from dance school
I gotta touch you whenever you make it jiggle fast
And have my fingers all over you like a liver's place

I circle your area, I'm a cartwheel
I want to know how your booty move in them hard heels
You got a nice rack, can I get a boob shot?
I put in work, I got my condoms in my tool box

I see your left cheek beefin' with your right cheek
Hop on my motorbike, ride a nigga like Bike Week
You play the quarterback, I'ma participate
Hey, what you should be tryin' to do is throw it this a-way

Throw that ass this a-way
Throw that ass this a-way
Throw that ass this a-way
Throw that ass this a-way

Drop that ass, drop that ass
Drop that, drop that, drop that ass
Drop that ass, drop that ass
Drop that, drop that, drop that ass

Hey, there's a lot of ho's at the party
But you the only one a nigga lookin' at, shawty
Hey, there's a lot of ho's at the party
But you the only one a nigga lookin' at, shawty

Throw that ass this a-way
Throw that ass this a-way
Throw that ass this a-way
Throw that ass this a-way

Drop that ass, drop that ass
Drop that, drop that, drop that ass
Drop that ass, drop that ass
Drop that, drop that, drop that ass
