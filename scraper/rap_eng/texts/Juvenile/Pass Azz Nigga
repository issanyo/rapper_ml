So listen to your ma and don't get mad trying to serve me
Nowadays niggas be starting a rappin'
Jealous out they're mouth cause they know what I'm stressing

The niggas in my hood ain't nothin' but hustlers
You say you might be down, but we still don't trust ya
We knew his face, we didn't know his name
'Bout to show this motherfucker we true to the game
My boy grabbed a nine and I grabbed a 47
A 37 and grabbed a mack 11
We see these fellas trying creepin' our tape
Put fire on his ass and blew the fucker away
He tried to run, but we caught him on the melia
Had to take him out cause he's a pussy azz nigga
Pussy azz nigga, pussy azz nigga, pussy azz nigga

[Verse 4]
You used to be real, you used to be down
But you turned a bitch when quick left town
You used to be in the clan, and all that cest
But now I heard you even less
Like a nigga like me out from the magnolia
When you like a bitch, and went out like a solja
Every time I see you all in the mess
You got the slugs in your mouth, swear to god, you a pimp
With your shine ass car and nothin' left
Got niggas selling boards and mef's
Pussy azz niggas
