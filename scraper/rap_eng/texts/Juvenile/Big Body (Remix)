What?  What?  What?
Off top, we flossin'...
Down South, off top

Chorus [Beelow]:

Big Bodies, them big bodies what'cha playin' in?
Them Big Bodies, big bodies, what'cha thuggin' in?
Big bodies, them big bodies, what'cha flossin' in?
Big bodies, them big bodies

First Verse [Beelow, Thug Addict, Juvenile]:

[Beelow]
Whoa na, Wootay that's me
Ridin' fly in all types of rides in the big body
I'm layin' it down with my rounds, like my dog B
We flossed out with the ice in the ES-3
The six-hundred got a clip sittin' on chrome, brah
Window tent, leather seats, with the phone, brah
Gimme a pop through the city and it's on, brah
Best believe might take her home and wet her down, brah
We paid hustlas in this game tryin' to make a mil
Have a house on the hill and sit back and chill
Cuz down South them boys they be bout that scrilla
Say we hustlin' in this game to clock seven figures
Reala, what?
Now I'ma run it to my playas in that B.R.C.,
Thugged out, straight flossin' in them big bodies
We paper chasin', slangin' weight cuz all we want is the cheese
Down South takin' over it's off the heezie
I'ma run it through my playas in that B.R.C.,
Thugged out, straight flossin' in them big bodies
We paper chasin', slangin' weight cuz all we want is the cheese
Down South takin' over it's off the heezie

[Thug Addict]
Hunh
I got TWENTY BIG BODY CARS
WITH TWENTY BIG BODY BROADS
TWENTY BIG BODY TRUCKS
TALKIN' BOUT BIG BODY YARDS
Pushin' Lexus GS's, Impala SS's
Navigators, 4runner's
Expeditions and hummers
Got the bounce in my car
Trunk nothin' but raw
I GOT THE BIGFOOT TRUCK WITH THE SHOCKS AND ALL
T.V., C.D., with the DVD
I got EVERYBODY OUT'CHEA WANNA RIDE WITH ME
Skkkkkerrttt, burn rubber on the highway with me
I'm doin' eighty on that ass as I mash the gas
I run over everything on the floor if you don't let me pass
I'ma bulldoze through, like a Gangsta Mac
Say what?
Them boys ridin' big bodies we done did that
Pushin' F-150's, 250's, and doin' it boy, we doin' that
Lookin' like "Who them people in them big ol' truck that think they runnin'
That?"
Them boys ridin' big bodies, how ya luv that?

[Juvenile]
Look what'cha thinkin' bout my nigga when you say what you say?
You must have like let down your guard and shit we breakin' yo head
It ain't nothin' you can say to me that'll make me afraid
I done walked with niggas like you, every one of 'em dead
I done fucked some of the baddest hoes, chocolate and red
Put the dick on the bitch like I just came home from the Feds
Can you picture a nigga holdin' my dick on the cover of Rage?
Number one spot up in the radio for seventy days
Throw a concert in the Superdome and pack it like Ma$e
Ca$h Money put it together so the family pays
We was tied up in the race but now we runnin' away
Niggas ain't gone shut us up we got our guns in they face
And we gone keep these bitches shakin' they ass up in the place
Drank everything we pay for cuz ain't nothin' to waste
All you niggas bout'cha issue I know y'all could relate
I'm tryin' to lace y'all with this game so all of y'all can be straight

Chorus

[Beelow]
I say black navi's, suburban accessories
Leather seats, watch the remix on your four T.V.'s
I'm layin' it down, STILL clownin' when I hit yo streets
Yo baby Momma and yo kid all over my D
Beelow (what's up?) doin' gold and bezzled up
They ride through the park in the big black truck
I'm actin' back like I told ya
And if you don't have a big body then pull over
Twenty-inch shells on them burbans how we roll, brah
My Ballin' clique is actin' donkey on ya, hanh brah?
This big bodies all the time, brah
That's how we shine, brah
I'm on the grind, brah
Flossin' all the time, brah
I turn they heads and they wonder what I'm ridin' in next?
With J.D. and Larell in that bubble-ah Lex
Whoa na, we done did it, ha?
And you don't like it cuz we flossin' big bodies, ha?
Luh-luh-luh-look

Chorus (1/2x)

[Beelow]
Now I'ma run it to my playas in that B.R.C.,
Thugged out, straight flossin' in them big bodies
We paper chasin', slangin' weight cuz all we want is the cheese
Down South takin' over it's off the heezie
I'ma run it to my playas in that B.R.C.,
Thugged out, straight flossin' in them big bodies
We paper chasin', slangin' weight cuz all we want is the cheese
Down South takin' over it's off the heezie
