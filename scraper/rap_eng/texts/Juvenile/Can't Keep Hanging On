[Verse 1: Juvenile]
I'm smoking on that Jamaica
My pistol cocked for my haters
Got opium on the table
Gon hit the block with it later
I'm great and nobody greater
Except for my holy saviour
Don't come to me for no favors
'Cause I don't give up no paper
I swear you niggas a hater
Just like the people that raised you
Despite they say it's your life
But they still don't like your behavior
Because is a ?
Man ain't 'posed to be ?
Nathaniel is of that nature
Be damn if I wear that label
Damn if I let you play doe
Damn if you have your way doe
Damn if I let you win when my family living ain't stable
Damn if I let you take what I hustle hard and I pray for
Damn if I let you damage my chances, get out the way whoa
Can't keep holding on

[Hook]
I just can't keep hanging on
I just can't keep hanging on

[Verse 2: Skip]
I did three, they gave me six and I ain't snitch
I'm tryin' to plug when I get out, bitch I ain't rich
I'm a money making nigga but I ain't Mitch
I got on thousand dollars shoes and I ain't shit
I got a problem with authority, I don't like cops
I'll serve you anywhere, I just don't like shops
My cell phone poppin', I call that pops
I'mma self-made nigga, don't need no props
Don't owe you shit, you ain't give me nothing
'Cause I don't take fronts, your fake ass frontin'
Let me tell you something, I was raised up hustlin'
When a quarter bird cost a nigga like 7g's

[Hook]
I just can't keep hanging on
I just can't keep hanging on

[Verse 3: Lil Cali]
Judge just gave my nigga L
He may never see the streets
In the middle of getting bread
You may run in to some beef
Got them birds flyin' like hawks
And I ball like I'm Dominic
These bitch nigga catching a lil charge
Go to singin' like symphony
Ain't no limits, bitch I ain't P
I see murder, daily I be
In the trap, moving them keys
Tryna make a mill in a week
Straight out the pyrex, right to the projects, I gotta eat
No time to digest, chasing a profit, Pockets obese
I remember I couldn't eat, Lights off, same clothes
Whole world turned cold, Nigga only God knows
Live by the G Code (Never fold)
Whole team stay solid as a rock, Never told
