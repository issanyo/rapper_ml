[Chorus]
Old school, 90's shit, throwback know the shit
Came for a ride bitch, I'll be on that Trojan shit
Old school, pimping shit, you be on that drama shit
Cash money, hot boys, might just be on fire shit

[Verse 1]
In the back, drinks, smoking shit, too many girls in here
To be stuck on you I got this whole city locked this year
Hands in the air everywhere
Lil momma tell me to move, don't be scared
In the back, drinks, smoking shit, too many girls in here
To be stuck on you I got this house sitting locked this year
Hands in the air everywhere
Lil momma tell me to move, don't be scared

[Pre-Chorus]
Two could play the game, two could play the part
To you were the words that I said from my heart
Two way be the street, too late won't come
Cause today is the day that our two become on, I'm on that

[Chorus]
Old school, 90's shit, throwback know the shit
Came for a ride bitch, I'll be on that Trojan shit
Old school, pimping shit, you be on that drama shit
Cash money, hot boys, might just be on fire shit
Old school, 90's shit, throwback know the shit
Came for a ride bitch, I'll be on that Trojan shit
Old school, pimping shit, you be on that drama shit
Cash money, hot boys, might just be on fire shit

[Verse 2]
Shots fired cause you bad, oh no, you can't get mad
You came with that attitude and I came with this grocery bag
Light up the sky and get high
I'm pulling something outchea tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Two could play the game, two could play the part
To you were the words that I said from my heart
Two way be the street, too late won't come
Cause today is the day that our two become on, I'm on that

[Chorus]
Old school, 90's shit, throwback know the shit
Came for a ride bitch, I'll be on that Trojan shit
Old school, pimping shit, you be on that drama shit
Cash money, hot boys, might just be on fire shit
Old school, 90's shit, throwback know the shit
Came for a ride bitch, I'll be on that Trojan shit
Old school, pimping shit, you be on that drama shit
Cash money, hot boys, might just be on fire shit

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
I mean it when I tell it to ya
I'm close in person, ain't no need for me to yell it to ya
I hear you talking, you ain't saying nothing
Well see you can't just put out a fire, let's just spray something
You niggas softer than Vienna, homes
I got the juice, just know my chopper can a hoe
We showing off so turn the cameras on
Me and my niggas in there wilding with bandanas on

[Chorus]
Old school, 90's shit, throwback know the shit
Came for a ride bitch, I'll be on that Trojan shit
Old school, pimping shit, you be on that drama shit
Cash money, hot boys, might just be on fire shit
Old school, 90's shit, throwback know the shit
Came for a ride bitch, I'll be on that Trojan shit
Old school, pimping shit, you be on that drama shit
Cash money, hot boys, might just be on fire shit
