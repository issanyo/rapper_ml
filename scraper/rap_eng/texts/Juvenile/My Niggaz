[Hook: Juvenile + (Future)]
(Lil whodie keep that dog food on him, lil whodie keep that dog food on him)
My niggas, ain't nobody realer than my motherfuckin' niggas
(Lil whodie keep that dog food on him, lil whodie keep that dog food on him))
So fuck all ya'll niggas, I ride, I die for my motherfuckin' niggas
(Lil whodie keep that dog food on him, lil whodie keep that dog food on him))
And we don't really fuck with ya'll
I said we don't really fuck with ya'll
(Lil whodie keep that dog food on him, lil whodie keep that dog food on him))
I said we don't really fuck with ya'll

[Verse 1: Future]
Drop head phante-um, drive a new millenium
Drowsy than a motherfucker, sippin' on Promethazone
Diamonds and Audemars, face Sierra Leone
Call my daddy and that powder, powder in the bathroom
Pyrex in my memory, these pussy niggas envy me
Call in my new Bugatti and I'm makin' history
Pussy niggas lollygag around, I show no sympathy
Hit 'em with that .44 chopper, bullets in my enemy
Pain in my vocal cord, chronic in my visual
Monster,  Beast Mode, 56 Nights was pinnacle
Chinchilla scattered on my floors of my living room
Marble floors in this bitch, I fucking need a centerfold

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
One of my niggas in Dallas he went up there
He was walkin' but he came back in a Beemer that's how ya 'posed to do
When he got back to New Orleans, he went and built him a palace
The best that money could offer cause he was overdue
And then he got him a package and brought it back to the projects
So he could break that bitch down and put all his niggas on
Sellin' cocaine is a talent that he picked up from his parents
And he was after the challenge to be a million strong
He told his homies he had it
When they came over they grabbed it
He told 'em never come back cause it ain't gone be no more
He knew it all was a gamble
That's why I stayed the realest and gave an example to let the people know
