[Verse 1: Juvenile]
You gone take them 5? Or you gon' take them to the trial?
And go get denied?
By that probation and you just got, caught with that fry
That alibi ain't gone work
Ain't it somethin' how them niggas from out that three be doin' that dirt?
Score a quarter from oh-oh, rock it up by four-four
Then you can go in them hallways and smoke that fire all day
Shhhh....be quiet
Tonight is the night that we ride
Thirty camouflage hummers with niggas inside
With choppers, doin', surgery on bodies like head doctors
Be quiet, 'cause they mad tonight, we gon' act a ass tonight
I'ma take a body to that project for a sacrifice
That Calliope got that dope for less
Fuck around that bitch if you want, and get left
Brains hangin' off the steps, people cryin'
Second line, T-shirtin', feet hurtin' from all of that twerkin'

[Chorus: Juvenile]
Calliope thug
3rd Ward Solja
Melphanine thug
3rd Ward Solja
P-S-E thugs
3rd Ward Solja
Wild Magnolia
3rd Ward Solja

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
I'm an optimal smokin', chopper totin'
Bustin' caps wide open
Top of line coatin', Reebok sportin'
Expedition corner spender
Big fine woman bender, put the weight in the blender
Got big bags by rillas
Shiesty like a splinter, and empty out the braids in the center
U.P.T. fader remember
Follow me, follow me
Follow me now bitches we be some Hot Boys...
Run up on the 3 and you will get stopped boy
Follow me now bitches we be some Hot Boys...
Run up on the 3 and you will get stopped boy
Follow me now bitches we be some Hot Boys...
Run up on P-S-E and you will get stopped boy
Follow me now bitches we be some Hot Boys...
Run up on the third and you will get stopped boy
Follow me now bitches we be some Hot Boys...
Run up on the U and you will get stopped boy

[Chorus: Juvenile]
Calliope thug
3rd Ward Solja
Melphanine thug
3rd Ward Solja
P-S-E thugs
3rd Ward Solja
Wild Magnolia
3rd Ward Solja

[Verse 3: Manny Fresh]
I'm from the seventh ward, and I believe in God
I drive seven thirty-five's and I love these broads
I wear Girbaud jeans, and I bought my green
Camouflage over our eyes that's how we do these things
I run with Juvenile, that nigga so wild
Get buck like the fuck I'm glad I use Dial
Now who the fuck I are? I'm a superstar
Ca$h Money rules everything around me bruh

[Verse 4: Magnolia Shorty]
Shop on that Ramp, shop in the Lio and Josephine
Shop in that Nolia, that Valence Street and P-S-E
They got some Hot Boys that represent that U.P.T.,
And where they be, three hundred and fifty degrees
Shop on that Ramp, shop in that Lio and Josephine
Shop in that Nolia, that Valence Street and P-S-E
That got some Hot Boys that represent that U.P.T.,
And where they be, three hundred and fifty degrees

[Chorus: Juvenile]
Calliope thug
3rd Ward Solja
Melphanine thug
3rd Ward Solja
P-S-E thugs
3rd Ward Solja
Wild Magnolia
3rd Ward Solja

[Verse 5]
Gert-Town, Downtown, and Holly Grove can't fuck with the Melph and the Calio
I told ya, I told ya, them boys don't want beef with the Nolia
And I warned ya, and I warned ya
Can't fuck with that 10th ward St. Thomas
And on the V.L., and on the V.L., can't fuck with them boys on V.L
Apple and Eagle so real they come, that's the only real niggas in Carrollton
Gert-Town, Downtown and Holly Grove can't fuck with the Melph and the Calio
I told ya, I told ya, them boys don't want beef with that Nolia
And I warned ya, and I warned ya
Can't fuck with that 10th Ward St. Thomas
3rd Ward ho, Mac and the Melph, Calio
3rd Ward ho, Mac and the Melph, Calio
3rd Ward ho, Mac and the Melph, Calio
3rd Ward ho, Mac and the Melph, Calio

[Outro: Juvenile]
Lights on, mask on creep silent
Lights gone, we done left your block quiet
Lights on, mask on creep silent
Lights gone, we done left your block quiet
