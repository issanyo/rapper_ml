[Verse 1: B.G.]
Is you 'bout what I brang nigga?
Biggety-bang nigga?
Get it through your head before I let it rang nigga
Whoa nigga, you ain't a friend, you a foe
Hoe nigga, I gotta let the pistol go
Show niggas, that I ain't the one to blow on
I told ya nigga with the four four I get it on
I roll with niggas, that tote big chrome
Uptown V.L. off top niggas bustin' domes
Paper chasin', racin', to six figures
The law bitchin', I'm catchin' cases totin' triggers
Smokin' niggas, all theyself Locin' niggas
I'm chokin' off the optimal still ropin' niggas
Scopin' niggas, 'cause I'm the same broke nigga
Snort dope but I still maintain sellin' coke
Spin dressin' holder, blunt smoker
Snort a lil' doper, A.K. toter
I'm a spittin' I'm a solja
Take it off your shoulder
Respect nigga I'm a solja, take it off your shoulder
Uptown clown, gettin' so dirty
Respect my fuckin' mind, gotta get my nose dirty
Playa haters wanna kill me
Juvenile I know you feel me
I'm too smart to let em' steal me
Refuse to let 'em steal me
Nigga fuck ya, I'ma pluck ya
Struck ya, wasn't beware of the headbusters

[Chorus: Manny Fresh]:
Headbusters, wig splitters, one time
Hot Boys committin' that crime
Welcome to the section of the Hot Boys
Look out for the infrared dot boy

[Verse 2: Bullet Proof]
S.K.'s, choppers, that's how we play
Ride all day, give up your spot for much yay
I hear ya got it, shop close, we hit'cha block
Unload the Glock, seventeen, we leavin' ya hot
Bodies drop, no more shop, in this spot
I made it hot bustin' with the Glock non-stop
I'm full of that block, a young G about my cheese
Jackin' for keys, frontin' back to real G's
Tryin' to make my mill, freeze, slip you get killed
The shit's real act a donkey behind a dope house deal
Straight from Uptown, real niggas we in the Wild
Yellow tape style, bound to make the nine growl
Bodies found in the dumpster, by the youngsters
Shouldn't trust a, Uptown head buster

[Chorus: Manny Fresh]:
Headbusters, wig splitters, one time
Hot Boys committin' that crime
Welcome to the section of the Hot Boys
Look out for the infrared dot boy

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
Where the villains be, is where I stand
I'm comin' with that tillery, up in my hand
Showin' you bitches the reason, that I'm the man
I'm stoppin' you hoes from breathin', you understand?
Comin' with that A.K., full of that pure
A cold night in February I had that bitch like New Year
You better watch me 'cause I be comin'
With the drummin', a chopper, or a street sweeper or somethin'
Bitch I'ma represent, my .45 pay the rent
You bitch you, you fuck with me it's a must you get'cha issue
I'ma be standin', in the Magnolia with the cannon
And sure to start damage
Watchin' these niggas, 'cause they donkeys and fools too
Might look like they spooked, but don't let them niggas fool you
Every breath that I breathe would be beef, so I snorted
Then proceeded to make my enemy's life short, bout that
Pistol play, fuck what a nigga say
Two-twenty three's then breathe fire out the hallway
I found myself up in other niggas beef
Know that them T.C. niggas would die for me
We probably be
In an all-black fist full of that bitch
And a stroller suburban on the blitz, tryin' to get rich
If in my way, I'm gone funk ya
Imagine your body deteiorating in a dumpster
What you gone do?  Ain't no runnin' when the Mafia finds ya
I'ma, UPS your death like the Unibomber
I can't sleep, I got so much beef in the game
Every hotel that I change I use an alias name
Me and B.G. on a hunt, full of that pluck
Two niggas with pistols, tryin' to make a come up

[Chorus: Manny Fresh]:
Headbusters, wig splitters, one time
Hot Boys committin' that crime
Welcome to the section of the Hot Boys
Look out for the infrared dot boy
