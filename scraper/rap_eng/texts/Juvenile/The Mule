[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
What?
King of the Ghetto what they call me, 'cause I rule this bitch (rule this bitch)
I'm 'bout business, I don't participate in foolishness (foolishness)
But every now and then somebody want to get the trippin' with me
That's when I get stupid and them gorilla niggas be with me
But I'd rather be running up in something wet and slippery (wet and slipperrrry)
Waiting on a nigga baby mama to come visit me (visit meeee)
They know I'm working with something so they be tryna holla (tryna holla)
They nigga just make 'em moan, they hit me when they tryna holla (tryna holla)
Guess I be digging to deep, they emotions start growing
Got they husband wonderin' who they been fucking four in the morning (four in the morning)
Lil mama cover you track, if ya man find out
And call himself tryna check me I'ma beat his bitch ass
He just mad 'cause he be missing and needing his bitch ass
And he mad 'cause I be rubbing and squeezing his bitch ass
He in love with the chick, she don't even remember his ass
She down for Z-Ro and do anything I ask, 'cause I hit her with the mule

[Chorus: Devin the Dude & Z-Ro]
That's the reason why these broads be trippin'
Don't want me to be with no other women ('cause I hit 'em with the mule)
Goin' too deep when I be diggin' up in 'em
Bumping up against they kidneys when I stick them ('cause I hit 'em with the mule)
That's the reason why these broads be trippin'
Don't want me to be with no other women ('cause I hit 'em with the mule)
Goin' too deep when I be diggin' up in 'em
Bumping up against they kidneys when I stick them ('cause I hit 'em with the mule)

[Verse 2: Devin the Dude]
Valerie is mad at me because I ran up in Kim
Kim got a nigga so Val told him
How I be sneaking with his gal yeah massaging that monkey
Slapping her on the ass while she riding that donkey
And now my name in the mix
But thats what you get putting your thang in a bitch
You got to butt em' up stick 'em ha ha and dip
Flush the rubber yep and get in the car and flip
But hoes always know where your ride at
Or at least where it was they notice the tire tracks now they flat
So I learned to be polite move over please
Grind it up in them an damn near damage their ovaries
Jack that ass up look at a minute
Then urghhh ride up in it
It's a certain way you stroke the hoes
Take her on a vacation Poconos

[Chorus: Devin the Dude & Z-Ro]
That's the reason why these broads be trippin'
Don't want me to be with no other women ('cause I hit 'em with the mule)
Goin' too deep when I be diggin' up in 'em
Bumping up against they kidneys when I stick them ('cause I hit 'em with the mule)
That's the reason why these broads be trippin'
Don't want me to be with no other women ('cause I hit 'em with the mule)
Goin' too deep when I be diggin' up in 'em
Bumping up against they kidneys when I stick them ('cause I hit 'em with the mule)

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
Look I can't help but see her she got that big ol' bumper behind her
When I see her she remind me of my lil mama Mia
I don't want rewind back to my bahama dear
She was out chea this lil nigga got her here
You wanna know bout my neighbor yeah I kinda knew her
She was impress with my whips, I was a connoisseur
Kinda blew her off cause she was playing me tight
Bumping down and let them whitey boys change her life
I hope you ain't beefing
And my past ain't got nothing to do with me hitting that ass
Ma I'm tweaking, I'm from a different world
Where you don't tie a woman down if she want to look around go head and get it girl
Flexxa time to have sexxa
Look how ya got me I don worked up a sweat
Calling my number cause no one do it better
Got you at home at night writing me letters

[Chorus: Devin the Dude & Z-Ro]
That's the reason why these broads be trippin'
Don't want me to be with no other women ('cause I hit 'em with the mule)
Goin' too deep when I be diggin' up in 'em
Bumping up against they kidneys when I stick them ('cause I hit 'em with the mule)
That's the reason why these broads be trippin'
Don't want me to be with no other women ('cause I hit 'em with the mule)
Goin' too deep when I be diggin' up in 'em
Bumping up against they kidneys when I stick them ('cause I hit 'em with the mule)

[Verse 4: Z-Ro]
Pissed off 'cause too many people been in my face
Mean mugging everybody two seconds from catching a case
Plus somebody just hit my car man the shit don't stop
Go thru my phone and choose a victim take it out on the cock (on the cock)
Ma thinking bout gripping ass thats why I hit it swift and fast
I'm a put this log on you you gon' feel it all in your calves
A gangsta so I'm raw with it I know what I'm doing
Thats why she pop up at my residence trying to see what I'm doing
She knocking if the lights on ready to get her fight on
Cause last night she had orgasms all night long
Made her feel like she was married with children
But ain't no Al and Peggy I'm strictly here to do some drilling in your man filling
There would be my hand filling all up in your you know
But you disappointed cause you ain't my numero uno
So you go acting a fool breaking all a players rule
Straight forgot you had dude at home
Cause I hit you with the mule

[Chorus: Devin the Dude & Z-Ro]
That's the reason why these broads be trippin'
Don't want me to be with no other women ('cause I hit 'em with the mule)
Goin' too deep when I be diggin' up in 'em
Bumping up against they kidneys when I stick them ('cause I hit 'em with the mule)
That's the reason why these broads be trippin'
Don't want me to be with no other women ('cause I hit 'em with the mule)
Goin' too deep when I be diggin' up in 'em
Bumping up against they kidneys when I stick them ('cause I hit 'em with the mule)
