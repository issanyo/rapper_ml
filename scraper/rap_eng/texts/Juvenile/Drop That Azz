Roll that ass this away [x4]

Drop that ass

Theres a lot of hoes in this party
But your the only one I'm really look at shawty [x2]

When ever you shake it you make a player smile
Wonderin if you can drop it hot potato style
My holiday girl
My little mrs christmas
Can you excuse me for thinking with my dipstick
Im lovin on you and you an you hearing this from any sorce
Dancing with you kinda feel like we having intercorse
We get to talking we can put this shit on ordercheck
I had a fucked up day but you changing all of that
I hope your ready we partyin till the next day
I bent it over and huddled up for the next play
You play the quarterback and I'm gonna participate
And what you should be tryin to do is throw it this way

It just only took me a glance too
See you back it up like you graduated from dance school
I gotta touch you whenever you make it jiggle fast
And have my fingers all over you like a lil splash
I circle your area I'mma a cart wheel
I wanna know how your booty moves in those hard heels
You gotta nice rack can I get a boob shot
I put in work I got my condoms in my tool box
I see your left cheek even with your right check
Im on my motor bike riding that nigga like bike week
You play the quarterback and I'm gonna participate
And what you should be tryin to do is throw it this way
