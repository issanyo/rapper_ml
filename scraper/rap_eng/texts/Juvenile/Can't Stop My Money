You know how we rolling, my money stand tall, dollar bills ain't folding
Down, I'm top floor bound, this is how it goes down
This is black card music, this is black card, this is black card
This is black card, money I got

Shit I've been known for balling hard y'all be ballet hooping
I'm Chris to bottles, I'm bout the alley
These younger niggas respect me I'm like a daddy to them
These younger bitches won't sex me you know I dare to do them
I am a bad influence, with a black card
These waitresses get excited when I'm passing it to them
Sitting back in that panamera Porsche I win it
I see more pussy in a week then in an abortion clinic
Can I live, the crib is like a high-school
I'm at the â€¦ with the credit call on the high
Round 2, niggas better drink up
What you looking at the register for? Let it ring up

You know how we rolling, my money stand tall, dollar bills ain't folding
Down, I'm top floor bound, this is how it goes down

This is black card music, this is black card, this is black card
This is black card, money I got

We didn't got too hot, yeah wait to who drop
All eyes on us
I'm feeling like 2Pac, who shot, who
Shit, we blowing through the roof top
Back to the front, we want our true spot
Don't turn this into a shoot out
We only move out
Yeah, Katrina couldn't keep the out
But passed 2012, you a 1997
You niggas need to take the new need to own something
Y'all ain't own nothing
But the jewelry, the cars, videos, the clothes and that old money
Yeah how much you got, that's why I won't holler
You got old bucks, I want amero dollars

You know how we rolling, my money stand tall, dollar bills ain't folding
Down, I'm top floor bound, this is how it goes down
This is black card music, this is black card, this is black card
This is black card, money I got
