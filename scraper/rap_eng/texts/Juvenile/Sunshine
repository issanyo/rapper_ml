(Player my sister in a 2001 tinted and rimmed up)
I take care of my baby mommas like we still together
(When my brother get out of jail man I'mma buy him whatever)
Credit in my yellow gold in exchange for white
(Y'all saw me at the Source Awards, wasn't that shit like tight?)
Cartier frames with wood grain on the ear
(V.S.O.P. Hennessy, so save y'all fuckin beers)
A diehard nigga, a 3rd Ward nigga
(7th Ward hardhead ready for war nigga)
A Cash Money clown, tattooed and scarred nigga
(I ain't bitchin up for nar' one of y'all funky ass niggas)
Princess cuts, baguettes and marquises - what that say?

[Lil Wayne]

Oh my God! He's drivin from the passenger's side
Million dollar conversation when I talk I'm shinin

A young cat like me with Bill Clinton figures
I'mma expensive nigga, drive Bentleys nigga

Best type got navigation system nigga
VCR, PlayStation, televisions nigga
You know stuntin is a habit, chrome on the Navi
TV's in that rear headrest to entertain the traffic
They call me the hot man, got the block on lock man
All my cars chopped man, all my trucks drop man
Trunk full of knock man, wrist full of rocks man
Pants full of Glocks man, sunshine spot man

[Hook]
