[Intro: helicopter sound effects]

[Verse 1]
You 'bout dat paper?
You on top?
You handlin' business?
You doin' swell?
Down with yo' niggas to da finish?
Are you willin'?
To hit da streetz up and make a killin'?
Are you a villain?
Pushin' a Bentley makin' millions?
Do you do your time?
Without rattin' on your partners?
Do you kill your beef?
With a pistol or a chopper?
Is you da man?
Do you pay all of your bills?
Did you make a plan?
And won't stop 'till it fulfilled?
Can you handle coke?
Can you handle dope?
Ain't afraid to go?
Even though you know?
Look... lil' Daddy...
Do you take care of yo' kids?
Is it clean in yo' crib?
Can't you stand to eat some ribs?
Ain't it scandalous how we live?
You ball with Cash Money?
Do you like Manny track?
Ain't it shive how I rap?
Puttin' New Orleans on the map!
You brush ya teeth?
You on dem hoes?
You got dem Ree[bok]s on ya feet?
With dem Girbauds?

[Chorus]
Then you a soulja nigga, put up a solja rag
Put up a soljah rag
Put up a soljah rag
Then you a soulja nigga, put up a solja rag
Put up a soljah rag
Put up a soljah rag
Then you a soulja nigga, put up a solja rag
Put up a soljah rag
Put up a soljah rag
Then you a soulja nigga, put up a solja rag
Put up a soljah rag
Put up a soljah rag

[Verse 2]
Now what's happenin' wit' you?
You knockin' dem heads off too?
You do what a playa do?
You fuck in the Rochambeau?
You ain't scared to blast?
When you got dat iron witcha
Do you bust his ass?
You acts a ass?
You got ya ski mask?
And ya solja rag?
Look...
You ready to blow a bag?
Can you hustle like it's legal?
Can you avoid da people?
And hotwire your Regal?
You 'bout dat evil?
Look...
You on some ignorant shit?
When that ho get flip
Now can you punish da bitch?
You like dem Beamers?
You like dem Benz 500s?
You like dem Hummers?
You like dem big fine womens?
You a playa ain't ya?
None of these bitch niggas could fade ya!
The ghetto made ya!
Dope fiends and junkies raised ya!
Do you sleep in suites?
Do you go shopping every week?
When you hit da streetz
You got dem Reeboks on your feet?

[Chorus]
Then you a SOLJA nigga, put up a solja rag!!
Throw up a solja rag
Put up a solja rag
Throw up a solja rag
Put up a solja rag
Throw up a soljah rag
Put up a soljah rag
Put up a soljah rag
Throw up a soljah rag
Then you a soulja nigga, put up a solja rag
Put up a soljah rag
Put up a soljah rag
Then you a soulja nigga, put up a solja rag
Put up a soljah rag
Put up a soljah rag

[Verse 3]
Is you a paper chaser?
You got your block on fire?
Remainin' a G?
Until the moment you expire?
You know what it is?
To make nothin' outta somethin'?
You handle your biz?
And don't be cryin'
And its somethin'
Your niggas is in ya?
You got your girlfriends witcha?
Since you was a kid?
You was a instant wig-splitter?
You twinkle your slug?
You ain't no bitch huh?
You stompin' ya box in the mud?
A Hot Boy microwave oven
Tatooted up, booted up
None of you bitches lovin'
Your windows are tinted?
You got a g and a half and you ready to spend it?
You don't fuck with dem Nike tennis?
You play with Barettaz?
You sleep in the Royal Sonesta?
You won't fuck Vanessa?
You got chopperz up on ya dresser?
You believe in GOD?
But can you handle it when its hard?
And represent your ward?
You be stalkin' the boulevard?

[Chorus]
Put up a solja rag
Throw up a solja rag
Put up a solja rag
Put up a solja rag
Throw up a solja rag
Put up a solja rag
Throw up a solja rag
Put up a solja rag
Throw up a solja rag
Put up a solja rag
Put up a solja rag
Throw up a solja rag
Put up a solja rag
Throw up a solja rag
Put up a solja rag
Throw up a solja rag
Throw up a solja rag
Throw up a solja rag
