(Chorus - AK-SLIM)
I ain't tryna do that shit
Catch me on the block I'm tryna scoop that quick
Find me rollin' with that smooth ass clip
No case it's just a game I'm tryna Move Em Bricks, Bricks
Just tryna Move Em Bricks, Bricks
Just tryna Move Em Quick, Quick
Just tryna Move Em Bricks, Bricks


(AK-SLIM)
VERSE 1:
Too many plans, got the fucking feds out
Searching on the fucking block sending they reps out
Try to snitch nigga? Watch us cut your neck out
No time for scouts we getting paper like the banks out
I'm all about my cash I gotta stack out
Turn a 4 to a 6 and then we send out
More hunnids, then we count em till we pass out
Home girl in the game too she don't like the crack house
Catch you lurking on the spot, we always got a eye out
Let the nine squeeze, it got your brains out
Most niggas only got you when they need something
Talk shit but when they see you they just keep running
Pack that 38, damn I just keep stuntin'
Running with the 4 piece like a OG
Send my nigga Okeyz, heard we posted
And we loaded, no surprise my nigga

(Chorus - AK-SLIM)
I ain't tryna do that shit
Catch me on the block I'm tryna scoop that quick
Find me rollin' with that smooth ass clip
No case it's just a game I'm tryna Move Em Bricks, Bricks
Just tryna Move Em Bricks, Bricks
Just tryna Move Em Quick, Quick
Just tryna Move Em Bricks, Bricks

VERSE 2:
My niggas we ain't that different we the fuckin' same
Just tryna run the game, we don't need to fuck with lames
We don't need to fuck with lames, juicing on this shit, like it's fucking bane
Coolin with your bitch sipping on the champagne
Killin' this beat hard, call us Killer Kane
Get this money, watch me stack it till I buy a plane
We a bunch of crazy niggas 'bout to go insane
Only takes 1 shot to leave you in pain
Snitches getting murked too, we ain't tryna catch no case
These niggas two-faced, that's why no trust our campaign
I lost a lot of bros cause of the fucking game
E.A.G running YYC, we fuckin' slaying

(Chorus - AK-SLIM)
I ain't tryna do that shit
Catch me on the block I'm tryna scoop that quick
Find me rollin' with that smooth ass clip
No case it's just a game I'm tryna Move Em Bricks, Bricks
Just tryna Move Em Bricks, Bricks
Just tryna Move Em Quick, Quick
Just tryna Move Em Bricks, Bricks

VERSE 3:
It's Token
Doing shit, rapping shit, you know we tryna move em bricks
Flipping shit, trapping shit, you know we tryna move em quick
Doing shit, she sipping dick, you know she swallow, she don't spit
N.T.C in YYC, can't trust nobody, not one bit
$umKindaToken in this bitch, and you know that I ain't tripping
No Trust Campaign, some nice champagne, that's the shit I'm sipping
Your bitch be riding while we vibing, whole house ain't no silence
And if you fucking interrupt, then you know we getting violent, say what
