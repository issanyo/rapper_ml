Unless she got that disease no ass at all
For the hood for the club, videos or whatever
I got the old skool the bentley or the porshe carrera
Profilin' with the top off.. whilin'
Lookin' for a dime piece that I can knock off

Up in the spot sippin' on a little sumthin'
Feeling like this joint bout to pop off
Lookin' around tryin' to spot a little sumthin'
Tryin to see what somebody's talkin' bout
And if it's good, I'm gonna let 'em in
Chew a lil' bit of game, all up in my ear
