My rims poking out like a fat ass
Little weight motherfucker, this straight glass
We beating up your block like some 15's
Video started playing on my six screens

This ain't Hollywood, nigga, this is street dreams
Got to holla at the hood making street cream
And you know we like our Benzes and our Cadillacs
We wearing so much bling, we give 'em cataracts

Down South, Dirty Third
3rd Coast, mayn, we got them birds
Get the ring bezeltynes and you heard
Rolling G five hundred in Excurs'

Best play, your position
These boys popping trunks, 'bout to cause a collision
Best make a decision, taking rap to a whole new dimension
24's 'bout to break the suspension, now nigga have dimension

You should ride with us, you should ride with us
You should ride with us, you should ride with us
You should ride with us, you should ride with us
You should ride with us, you should ride with us

Alright, I got the urge to strike, something dead in the ass
I'm in the future, y'all stay in the past, yeah
Nigga was broke holding my shoes
Rat funky as the fuck fools having it too

Same hoes that was talking that shit done turned groupie
I no longer have holes in my shoes, I rock Gucci
I know, you smell the cologne
You wishing that a nigga of my caliber was taking you home

Hate to intervene, while I'm making you moan
When I got a little situation at hand, baby, I'm gone
My alarm is going off, I know I been trailed
I ain't fucking with her though, both crazy as hell

That's the reason I'm posted up, here on Canal
Hoping you could do me and my nigga as well
Call your people up, we need a lot of females
Tell 'em we getting money, like a lottery sale

You should ride with us, you should ride with us
You should ride with us, you should ride with us
You should ride with us, you should ride with us
You should ride with us, you should ride with us

You should ride with us, you should ride with us
You should ride with us, you should ride with us
You should ride with us, you should ride with us
You should ride with us, you should ride with us
