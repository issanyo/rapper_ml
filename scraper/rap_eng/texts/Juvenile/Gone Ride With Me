[Verse 1]
I'm charging six hundred for some big Os
You do business with me, you coming back to get more
My shit is fire, cause it's jumpin' back to twenty-nine
So a nigga shouldn't have no problem bout me gettin' mine
If you come at me with a short I must say shop closed
Motherfuckers try to get smart you gon' get popped ho
I buck with niggas out the Jake like Will and Paco
Have conversations for bitches until they got drove
Picture me gently getting twisted off the indo
Baby, Lil Wayne, B.G., and me committing sins though
Better beware because we bout to spend a bend though
Don't get caught out without the shit cause you will end though
Me and my people got to hustle just to pay the rent
Some of us not in the position that we say we in
Can't have no bill collectors coming through my residence
That's why everyday I be runnin' for the presidents
All that knockin' another nigga, shits irrelevant
You get your head busted for playin' with my intelligence
Yeah

[Chorus]
My nine is gonna die with me
Pick up the supply with me
Be up in the ride with me
Do a homicide with me, who, me
My nine is gonna die with me
Pick up the supply with me
Be up in the ride with me
Do a homicide with me, who, me
My nine is gonna die with me
Pick up the supply with me

[Verse 2]
You making shit more complicated than it should be
You feel your death is comin' soon whodie it could be
Nigga got killed because they never understood me
I know your block is similar to how my hood be
This nigga with all of this playin' gettin' on my nerves
He callin' me up on the phone sayin' he want a bird
I told his daddy that's not how I handle business, man
How I know you not turning state and you be witnessin'?
Doing business with you I'm not even considerin'
How to be in the safe get around that you niggas in
I move too fast, remember patience is a virtue
And keep your eyes open cause niggas gon' observe you
They waiting for the perfect time that they can hurt you
And if they catch you off your basis they gon' serve you
I wonder if my people locked up still remember me
I'm talkin' bout Tulane and Broad, and penitentiaries
All my niggas

[Chorus]
My nine is gonna die with me
Pick up the supply with me
Do a homicide with me
Be up in the ride with me, who, me
My nine is gonna die with me
Pick up the supply with me
Do a homicide with me
Be up in the ride with me, who, me

[Verse 3]
I already got you listening to what I said
You better straighten up, there, soldier 'fore I bust your head
Ho if you got something you better not even show your face
Cause a nigga been doing bad and might explore your place
Look, you know you not about it cause they know you fake
If you want to go to war I know what it take
Come with a team of choppers, not no thirty-eight
And we gon' turn this 211 into a murder case
And me a Russell gon' get dizzy out the Thunderbird
And start a nuclear revolution right up on your curb
Niggas keep fuckin' with me cause they know I'm gettin' large
My truck is sitting on twenties, and I'm hittin' broads
If you get beside yourself, then you got to go
You creepin' on the C-M-B's that's not possible
I hit a fifty out my chopper and I got some more
You say you ready for me whodie I don't really know
No

[Chorus]
My nine is gonna ride with me
My nine is gonna die with me
Be up in the ride with me
Do a homicide with me, who, me
