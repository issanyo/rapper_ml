Verse 1: Lil' Wayne

Its Lil' Wayne (Lil' Wayne) on tha wall brain spilla
Grave filla

Dead bodies drugged out
Throw the slugs out
Love don't live here anymore

Spend ya benz is twenty slow
Get to tha house kick in tha door
You done pissed off my crew
What yall gone do
Look nigga you better put a zip on yo trap
Or you will get trapped
When I creep through tha black in tha black on black
Niggas be stumblin'
And crumblin'
When we come
They get curled up
Tear they world up
When we come
Now Slim and B with me

Turk and Manny with me
The CMB with me

Now I'm hangin' out the window screamin' there I go

And the diamonds bezeled ready I yes this me

(Chorus) 3x

Verse 2: Juvenile

I can't believe this these boys is playin' with me
I'm bout ta freeze this I keep that K with me
A nigga done played it raw thinkin' Ima hit that doe
Gave the boy my lil change and I ain't seen his face no moe
What do you call that there playin' a nigga ha dawg
The nigga thank its gravy but I'm bout ta break his block off
When you see them boys you know I'm bustin' out ta druggin' out
Don't be askin' who that is boy you better get the fuck
Muthafucka could be located nigga could be touched
I'll stab ya ass up
And its up by the cut
I keep my rees(reeboks) strapped on tight
My mac ring all night
People call the police cuz the say they can't sleep right
Them lil muthafuckas be makin' that noise
Them lil muthafuckas be slangin' it boy
Them lil muthafuckas be in them hallways
Them lil muthafuckas be bustin' all day
My first word was God bless me and my crew
My last word was bitch let a nigga through
I observe, the shit that muthafuckas do
You got nerve, what if this shit happen to you
Like the proverb, and it ain't nothin' but that boom
Now you got tha urge, to go and kill a nigga too
But remember this
You started this
So finish this
When you grab yo shit
You betta make sure that he hit

(Chorus) 3x
Verse 3: B.G

Everybody grab yo shit and slide it back
Uptown is goin' down tonite cha bout that
If not go yo bitch ass inside lock the door
To be safe bullets come through if so get on the floor
Me and my niggas got our black on ready ta ride
We head huntin' so somebody's gonna die
Homicide on tha scene three niggas pronounced smoked
The HotBoy$ did that that clique there ain't no joke
We don't carry choppers for decoration nigga
We carryin' ta send niggas on vactions nigga
Takin' me ta play wit that ain't a good solution
I'm dust out cuz I done have a grab mike he tootin'
Shootin' at niggas head tryin' ta knock it off
Its a dirty game so I gotta play it raw
In this warfield nigga you gotta be a killa
Cuz on tha reala

My mind made up ta ride

What I'm after nigga ta bust his ass he gone die
Don't cry nor poppa plead now its too late
Actin' like a bitch how is you gone get duct tape
Tear'em up Juve don't kill'em now we gone wait
Throw acid on his feet skeet gas all in his face
Show'em how it feel ta disrespect a HB
Show'em how we torture in tha UTP
We got no love if ya outside tha clique nigga
You get fucked over like a bitch nigga
We gone play it real nigga do it like tha mob
Cut his tongue out and stamp it mail it to his mom

(Chorus)2x

(B.G.) Niggas in trouble
(Juvenile) Niggas in trouble   (To End)
