I wake up in the morning, get out of my bed
Get your money nigga running through my head
Told my old lady I'ma carry that load
It's all about us it ain't about these hoes
The hood is my home, that's how I got rich
So nigga don't disturb me I'm enjoying my shit
Been running all day I'm about to finish my shift
I'm short a couple hundred I ain't even gonna trip
I'm in these streets like aaaahhhh ha

All good business right chere with no scam, No
I don't need pork but a nigga go ham
Thats what I was told so I already got bread
No you can't feed me cause I already got fed
I'm having my fun, raising my son
You're jealous about that cause you ain't even got one
White chucks, blue and red Jag, no tags
I pull up on the block like the American flag
The dope game dirty, it is what it is
Niggas gettin' mercked the same age as my kids
Whodie dapped me up and told me juvy shit real
Walk a couple inches down the street and got killed
Thanks to nothin even changed my mind
If I die right now probably be my time
I'm in these streets chasing my dreams
Shit, 'cause I could call shots, it don't work without green
I wake up in the morning, get out of my bed
Get your money nigga running through my head
Told my old lady I'ma carry that load
It's all about us it ain't about these hoes
The hood is my home, that's how I got rich
So nigga don't disturb me I'm enjoying my shit
Been running all day I'm about to finish my shift

A nigga walk light when I'm moving outside
I get another violation I'ma catch five
Now I don't starve, I'm going like Favre
And the po state boy want 25 large
And I go hard when they come to my fam
I got twin FNs and the bitches don't jam
I look the motherfucker in his eyes like what
Cause I don't give a fi fo fi fum fuck
Yeah that boy blessed, all the way fresh
My girl thugging wit me, together we turn necks
Back when I was young it wasn't making no sense
Now that I'ma throw the bitch I'm about to go in
Im about to start trends I mean what I speak
I can't have a bad day I gotta have a good week
I done had a good week looking for the right spot
Somewhere nice and comfortable where no one got shot
I wake up in the morning, get out of my bed
Get your money nigga running through my head
Told my old lady I'ma carry that load
It's all about us it ain't about these whose
The hood is my home, that's how I got rich
So nigga don't disturb me I'm enjoying my shit
Been running all day I'm about to finish my shift
