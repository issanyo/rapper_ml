Ay yo we down south posted and we counting our figures
Know how to treat these bitches and how to handle these niggas
Don't paly with us lil daddy becuase we'll have you in stiches

[Verse 1: Juvenile]
I pledge alegiance with the four nickle you niggas know pickle
Cock the pistol point my issue at you and whoadie who with you
Your body ain't nothing but greasle I can see threw the tissue
They gone think you was in gymnastics how this chopper gone flip you
I might have to crash the party if niggas gets me started
Better watch this big Glock forty because this bitch gets retarted
Fuck with me shorty I can teach you how to be flawless
NOPD want to see me up in court with them lawyers
Hating planting them charges take a nigga reguardless
Fuck them and duck them though tell them they suck on a hard dick

I already know what guns can do
I done seen some of the worst niggas get blown in two
