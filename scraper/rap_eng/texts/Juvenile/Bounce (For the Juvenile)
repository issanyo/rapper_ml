[Verse 1: Juvenile]
Brothers don't like Juvenile because the
Brothers don't like U.N.L.V. because the

Magnolia project keep slanging iron
A bunch of Uptown villains who don't mind dying
That Melpomene project keep slanging iron
A bunch of Uptown villains who don't mind dying
That Calliope project keep slanging iron
A bunch of Uptown villains who don't mind dying
That St. Thomas project keep slanging iron
A bunch of front of town villains who don't mind dying
That 13th Ward keep slanging iron
A bunch of Uptown villains who don't mind dying
That 9th Ward posse keep slanging iron
A bunch of Downtown villains who don't mind dying

Now bounce for the Juvenile, bounce for the Juvenile
Bounce trick, bounce, bounce, bounce
I said bounce for the Juvenile, bounce for the Juvenile
Bounce trick, bounce, bounce, bounce

[Verse 2]
Hey diddle diddle with the cat in the middle
Check out the Juvenile while I bust this riddle
Last night I met a freak, that I knew in the club
Felt the friction from her body when I gave her a hug
I let her know up front, I ain't got no ride
But won't you holla at the Juvie when we get outside?
She asked me fast, what we gonna do?
We gonna talk a little walk to the Rochambeau
Now I must admit, this was a sharp dressed chick
But she wasn't that sharp, I couldn't give her the stick
I went to G-ing this freak she couldn't take this stick
She went to moaning and groaning, "Juvenile, please quit"
I said, "TRIIIIIIIICK, stop talkin' that it
And buy Juvenile his outfit
I want a sharp Girbaud shirt, Polo socks
Girbaud shorts and a pair of Reeboks"
All the fellas say, "TRIIIIIIIIIIIICK, stop talkin' that it
And buy Juvenile his outfit
I want a sharp Girbaud shirt, Polo socks
Girbaud shorts and a pair of Reeboks"

All the fellas in the back, do what I told ya

TRIIIIIIIIIIIIICK stop telling that lie
We done hit you from the back for some Popeye's
You got a three piece white, a small, cold drink
Some red beans, a biscuit and small fries
All the fellas say "TRIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK stop telling that lie
We done hit you from the back for some Popeye's
You got a three piece white, a small, cold drink
Some red beans, a biscuit and small fries."
Yes I smoke weed, and that's it, black
So don't give no one, don't give no one no crack
One cigarette and a 40 and snake
And I fire weed spliff would just make my day
When I get high, I be spooked out
Booting up like I got a bunch of golds in my mouth
If you got it on your mind fella, we can go
I'm from the 3, Mac, Melph, and the Calio
