[Intro: Juvenile]
I see you Dame D.O.L.L.A. baby

[Hook: Juvenile]
They show way more love when you history
Pouring shots like liquor filling up the kidneys
They been high up in your ride, know that ten speed
Goin' hard so they never gon' forgive me
That legacy we leaving what we live for
Even when you getting it, you gotta get more
They holla great news, I'm tryna see what it in for
You got a hungry behavior, say that we live for
Say that we live for

[Post-Hook: Juvenile]
When you see me you see greatness
When you see me you see greatness
When you see me you see greatness
When you see me you see greatness

[Verse 1: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
I'm tryin' to touch as much real estate as I can
They know I was a hooper and a hell of a man
He was a hell of a worker, that had a hell of a plan
Plenty people that was sinking that he lift out the sand
Back at home they like, "He made it"
That decorated patience was amazing, looking back at the obstacles that he faced that ain't faze him
Bullets that could have grazed but it didn't, boy he a great one
Forrest Gump, he made it out and came back just to save 'em
Ballin' out in Portland, that Five-O-Three
Ain't talkin' Twitter when I tell you that they follow me
But thanks to my OG, make sure that God know me
Now I sit up, but I chatter like apostrophe
I be on the highway, thinkin' how the grind pay
Baby saying money talk, I lean on what my mom say
Then I let my heart talk, cuss on my compadre
Help them people rise up and make me [?]

[Hook: Juvenile]
They show way more love when you history

That legacy we leaving what we live for
Even when you getting it, you gotta get more
They holla great news, I'm tryna see what it in for
You got a hungry behavior, say that we live for
Say that we live for

[Verse 2: Danny from Sobrante]
They don't let you take off, no
They hatin' on your partner now gotta loaf
I convert that error and that white dope
I confront a sucker with that dust smoke
I daydream dollars and I nightmare prison fool
People who I love, but in doses we always get into it
Been over loving my neighborhood since I been at school
Now I [?], buy [?], buy tennis shoes
[?]
[?] club jackers in that black hawk
If I in a [?]
She love me, the devil go through hell inside my bill
I [?] how negative people I cope with jealousy
I know my horizons is broadened [?] my legacy
Now I got a bag of some of yall that I can't wait to see
Thugging 'till I die [?]
