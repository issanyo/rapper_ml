5th Ward Weebie:
(Chorus)
Girl I know I left you but I'm back for ya
I got your Michael Koors and a couple racks for ya
Girl you know I love you I go hard for ya
I went and got another food stamp card for ya
Girl I know I left you but I'm back for ya
I got your Michael Koors and a couple racks for ya
Call me when you need me girl, I'm there for ya
I got that 20 inch deep weave hair for ya

(Hook)

I told you I was comin’ back with a part 2
I said I was comin’ back with a part 2
I said I was comin’ back with a part 2

(Verse 1) 5th Ward Weebie:
Let me find out you tryin’ to give a nigga head
Let me find out you need the light bill paid
Let me find out you tryin to charge me for sex
Let me find out it’s 99 plus tax
Let me find out you know your booty build room
Let me find out you wear a plus size thong
Let me find out your stomach bigger than mine
Let me find out that’s why they call you Phat Fine
Let me find out you got them roaches in your closet
Let me find out when I come over they be hiding
Let me find out you wearin’ scrubs all in church
Let me find out you telling people you’re a nurse
Let me find out you let them (cheer about how you moan)
Let me find out you in the club getting drunk
Let me find out you wearin’ thousand dollar heels
Let me find out you can’t afford to pay them bills
Let me find out you out here cheatin on your husband
Let me find out your husband messin’ with yo cousin
Let me find out your baby daddy is a liar, wearin’ fresh polo but ain’t got no washer or no dryer
Let me find out your baby daddy is a fraud, he don’t take care of them kids but he run behind a broad
Let me find out he on the gram lookin’ thirsty
Let me find out 3 in the morning he be lurkin’
Let me find out out you gotta morphodite uncle
Let me find out when you was small he used to punk ya
Let me find out he actin holier than god
Let me find out he round here touchin’ lil boys
Let me find out he actin freaky on the weekend but in church on Sunday tellin’ people he a deacon
Let me find out them fools comin for his head
Let me find out they heard he workin for the feds
Let me find out (got ???? out of jail) but his ass came home and made an undercover sale
Let me find out this song ain't made it to rotation
Let me find out that you the only one hatin it

(Verse 2) Snoop Dogg:
Let me find out yo baby mama is a bitch
Let me find out you out early yousa a snitch
Let me find out that you workin ‘with the feds
Let me find out I’ll put a bullet in yo head
Let me find out you got just what I need
Let me find out you got them deals with the weed
Let me find out that you got an ass shot
Let me find out that you wearin’ booty pops
Let me find out that you really is a fraud
Let me find out that you really is a broad
Let me find out that you play hopscotch
Low down go down been around the block
Let me find out that you’re trickin’ at night
Let me find out that yo mama is a dyke
Let me find out that you gotta nigga in my house
Let me find out he be wearin’ yo ass out
Let me find out that he wearin’ my robe
Let me find out we sharin the same hoe
Let me find out that you think you’re so slick
Let me find out and ima get a new bitch

(Chorus)
Girl I still love you and I'm back for ya
I got your Michael Koors and a couple racks for ya
I say Girl I still love you and I'm back for ya
I got your Michael Koors and a couple racks for ya

(Hook)
I said bitch, you know what it do
I told you I was comin’ back with a part 2
I said I was comin’ back with a part 2
I said I was comin’ back with a part 2
