Say Bubba
I'm glad you, gave me the green light
So I can write some shit, for my hood
And talk about the shit I see
Y'knahmsayin? I've been waitin for this chance to do this
And express my motherfuckin self, and still make fun at the shit
Y'all ready to do this?

You might get flipped in the Nolia
You might get water whipped in the Nolia
And niggas is a trip in the Nolia
They be on some shit in the Nolia
Them hoes be twerkin in the Nolia
Police be lurkin in the Nolia
My pockets be hurtin in the Nolia
You gotta be workin in the Nolia
I hit my first bitch in the Nolia
I hit my first lick in the Nolia
I opened up shop in the Nolia

Hemmin them niggas up in the Nolia
Oh yeah we stick together in the Nolia
Down for whatever in the Nolia

You get a trespassin charge when you fuckin with me
Magnolia my home, and it's gon' always be
You get a trespassin charge when you fuckin with me

Came up on nothin in the Nolia
Nigga was hustlin in the Nolia
Junkies was rushin in the Nolia

Damn near lost my life in the Nolia
We play the porch in the Nolia
We hang out in the courts in the Nolia
We be on the flight in the Nolia
We be up all night in the Nolia

Ever since a kid in the Nolia

Some niggas can't be trusted in the Nolia
A nigga got jacked in the Nolia
Got stabbed in the back of the Nolia
