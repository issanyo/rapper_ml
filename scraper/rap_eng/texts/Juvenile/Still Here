[Featuring: Skip & Wacko]
Ain't that terrific? No one let you go and get all the shit that you want
The only thing is specific, Atlantic to Pacific, don't give a rat's ass
Up on the jet skies and led up do the back splash
'Cause you be yelling, you just set the hills
And you're the news in the Jimmy Choo's
That's why these dudes wanna interview
You tell them move, you're for juv' and they can't sit with you
They proud to call you a hoe
But guess what the fucker is far away and not say no
Get a child bullet and the head in bars stuck to a door
I got my hand cuffed so you're like a city cop
Nothing new world, bottle's gray, girl, six o clock
You get the paper from bed when all of these came
You fuck any shit, even when nigga's breath stink
Past, present and future, it's not a sex lane
You ain't denying, but what's so funny, your dress, hey
And we've been riding for a long time, oh yeah
And I'm so proud to say that you're mine
Even though sometimes you drive me crazy
But at the end of the day you're still my baby
You're still here, still right here
A woman know in five seconds if she wants you
You think you're really slipknot, don't you?
You can do it by yourself, why won't you?
And you don't need nobody help, why don't you
Marry yourself
You better get help, my homebro
This I felt from the top shelf, she was winding in it
I just wanted to shine, whad'up, my bedroom
White table cloth, 2012 a loss
Yeah, a life, proud to be boss
Your attitude pisses me off, acting like you've been rich
You're from the hood, you ain't shit
And I've been what you're real got it from the slim, bitches
Pock it some beans, bitches
But ain't hot stocks up and throw words in a pub
Team five cause real fall apart, tell 'em from heart
And we've been riding for a long time, oh yeah
And I'm so proud to say that you're mine
Even though sometimes you drive me crazy
But at the end of the day you're still my baby
You're still here, still right here
Yeah, that's my bullshit, got the shit together
Yeah, in a rough, we're gonna be rich forever
Yeah, she addicted to rich and skinny and chip and pepper
I'm addicted to automotors and limon pepper
Just tell her do it in the back and shawty is whatever
From the big ball and parties to the get togethers
In a drop they deny, there's some different ladder
Devil 07, James Bond, that's some different texture
From the years I heard furr to the red bottoms
She better got my back, I'm just paying hymons
She got charisma and slang, I'm just being honest
And she give me good brains, I don't need no college
Gee five all auto, I don't need pilot
Cruise around the world, no street maleadge
Anything we want then we buy it
And if you can't relate, don't require it
And we've been riding for a long time, oh yeah
And I'm so proud to say that you're mine
Still right here, still here...
