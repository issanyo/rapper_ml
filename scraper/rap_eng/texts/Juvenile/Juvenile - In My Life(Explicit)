Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls
Lil children, dogs and cats
Right now, you are listening to the incredible drum patterns of
DJ Mannie Fresh

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN !

[Chorus (X2)]
Mannie: Ima buy cars, Ima get clothes, Ima rock jewels
Ima fuck hoes, Ima smoke weed
Got alot of drinks, steppin out, gators, coca-cola mink
Juvenile: I Need it in my life, I want it in my life
Come put it in my life, Ima keep it in my life

[Verse 1 (Juvenile)]
It's that nigga Juve, from the magnolia, still loakin
You hoes know what's happenin with me
Bust that pussy open
Loose chest, loose booty
Round down and up
If a gangsta can't touch it, what you bouncin it fo'
Now give me leway, watch how a G play
Watch how my name get caught up in the he and she say
Its UTP day, we with the streets may
They represent us when they hear us at the DJs
Break bread with me, nigga is ya mad with me
Thought we was beefin, your supposed to spend your cash with me
I'm in here last with me, hold me down, give me a whip, give me
A bitch and let her blow me down
I'm so gutter, I'm so slick, i'm so grimey
I promise you something and I betcha don't find me
I'm a eat, purchase, whatever I please
CO, give me the keys, aww please, I need two of these

[Chorus (X1)]

[Verse 2 (Juvenile)]
I'm a be so courageous
And so contagious
Until my fuckin rap sheets gonna recieve mo' pages
Listen to Juve cuz this my year mon' (my year mon')
Invision I'm bout to kick it in here mon' (in here mon')
Don't you see the Soldiers and Bauds when I appear mon' (appear mon')
About being written on my face cuz I know fear mon' (fear mon')
Me and my team got a scheme to go light the block up
Skip, Smoove put in work and wacko poppin the chopper
I Scream the "U" cuz I mean it
The only difference is you be throwing your shit up when you screamin
I Seen it, shit all of the obstacles that I been through
What make you think i'm a be scared of a bitch like you
I'm ya dog, let me get it all consignment
You ain't paid them last people yet
Dog don't even remind me
I gain knowlege, my game polished, and it is obvious
You can't block it, you can't knock it, this is profit

[Chorus (X1)]

[Verse 3 (Juvenile)]
Can I untape the clips and chill ?
Show my nigga its real
Can my people shop in Beverly Hills
I got alot of work I know thats gonna be ahead of me still
But my peace mentality gon' keep me ahead in the field
Pardon me, but I got paper to chase
Now cut thru the talking and bring me straight to the safe
I know where the cameras at and I'm destroying the tape
I'm not leaving no evidence for the forensics to trace
I had a problem on my hand, a few bills I had been payin'
I figured about a lil'bit less than 75 grand
And my dog Rocky, caught a nickel for a pistol
Its serious when the federales comin' to get you
Life is at a standstill, outchere in this damn field
What you say, can get you and ya mans killed
This my last chance to come up, this gotta be it
Juve comin up, the first round' lottery pick

[Chorus (X1)]
