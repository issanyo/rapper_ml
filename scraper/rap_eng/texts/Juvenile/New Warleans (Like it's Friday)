[Intro]
?
Know what I mean? I get it by all means
?
?
It's all on me
This is my city, this is where I'm from
There's a lot of love, New Warleans
Street fame

[Verse 1: Kidd Kidd]
This big gun in my pants go boom
Like a bad smell it'll air out the room
In the morning right before your kids go to school
Who would have knew by lunch time that he’ll be on the news
Reporting live from the city of the blues
Investigators looking for clues, blues
These hard rhymes come from hard times
My pa was doing life, he caught hard time
Somebody died, here come the second line
Time to crack a smile, hold your cries inside
You see the pain in her face through a smirk
Celebratin' with your face on a shirt
You thought Katrina was the worst thing that happened to us?
You thought that FEMA money was enough?
But we gotta get it by all means
Trynna survive in the city of New Orleans

[Hook]
So fuck yesterday, say yes to the day
Because who knows if we gon' see tomorrow anyway
Only lord knows if we gonna die today
So we livin' everyday like it’s Friday, hey
Like it's Friday
We livin' everyday like it’s Friday, hey
Only lord knows if we gon' die today
So we livin' everyday like it’s Friday

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
High grade Adidas, anybody lead us
We left the house of blues and then we took it to Anita's
My niggas got the heaters, say they comin' out to meet us
We headed to together, said they'll prolly try to cheat us
Trippin' off my homie, I’m knowin' that he a rat
He be reachin' out his hand at me, I don’t be reachin' back
Be like, oh since you got money now nigga that’s how you act?
I read the paperwork and, yo homie, I know the facts
I had trouble with the law, but this ain’t the same issue
Now I realize we ain’t cut from the same tissue
I was tryin' to trim my mustache, but the lights went off
Nigga trynna joke about I used to pipe them off
Back in early Magnolia when boys done had flippers
When tourin' in ? was four and a half niggas
The hood is all chains, the spirit is gold in it
None made the same, the feeling was authentic

[Hook]

[Outro]
Little brothers, enjoy y'all life while y'all here man
This shit ain't promised
You know these niggas try like a mu' fucka in N-O man
I can't believe this shit
Little niggas man, just droppin' off the porch man
Just comin' out the womb, 12-13
Grabbin' that iron swingin' at mu fuckas
Pay attention homies
You know I'm not only livin' for me right now, I'm livin' for my kids man
And I suggest you do the same thing
You got a lot to live for homie, pay attention
Hey, Kidd Kidd, I love you for this nigga
Niggas get to hear that real shit, you feel me?
Uptown, downtown, stay connected nigga, I see you
