You need to graduate, you still in the fifth grade
You gotta problem, don't you bring it over this way
I'm be too high to be worried 'bout what a bitch say

Leave me alone when you see me in the night club
I'm in my zone and bitch, I'm high as a light bulb
I get another drink and then another drink

She say she sick of lanes? Well, I tell her take a dose of me

Betcha I get you right, I'm betta than Tylenol

New Orleans is my city, I be putting on
I'm at the top while you at the bottom looking on
Keep looking on and keep looking good
I ain't gon' never change, I'ma keep looking hood

I lay a lotta wood, I get a lotta cash
I lay a lotta juice, kush in the new Jag
I keep a couple hundred grand in the duffel bag
In the safe deposit box got another stash

You know how them uptown niggas get down
Them bricks high, but they still pay the price now
Drinks, pills and purp, I'm feeling right now
