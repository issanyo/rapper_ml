(Juvenile)
I makes the money, I don't let the money make me
Business as good as usual cuz it's a great street
My life is like a see-saw, I had some good times and had some bad times
Nigga was down to his last dime
I slept in a pissy hallway til' my people came and got me
Now a nigga ballin' and none of y'all won't top it
Nigga you muthafuckin' right my 99 you could type
Nigga you muthafuckin' right I'm bout to paint it with stripes
Nigga you muthafuckin' right it's C-M-R for life
Nigga you muthafuckin' right I slit your throat with a knife
What'cha really needs to be doin' is peepin' out my background
Before I stop you from playin', with this blat-blat sound
Nigga what's happenin' with you, what's up with your boys?
Tell them lil' muthafuckas to stop talkin' that noise
Hold tight, hold tight, I'm bout to rape you for your life
Hold tight, hold tight, or you won't make it through the night

Chorus (Bombshell & Baby Capone):

Hold tight, hold tight or you won't make it through the night
You bullshittin', you must don't value your life
Hold tight, hold tight, or you won't make it through the night
You bullshittin', you must don't value you life

(Baby Capone)
Only thought about it once, didn't think a second time
When a nigga came bustin' at me and runnin' with that nine
But then I realized, that I'm the tightest nigga that's on the street
And if I bust back and cause casualties then it'll be sweet
Been in this for four years
And a fifth year approachin', I'm bout to shine
And ain't no nigga up in this city that can tell me bout mine
See you blind bruh, talkin' about these diamonds I'm bout to get
But what I'm bouts to get
Ain't got a DAMNED thing to do with this shit
See I live here, you live there, we all live fair
Talkin' about that Sharp clique, and Ca$h Money
You don't look but you stare
See you done bought you some fight
And you done made it most of the night
So the next thing, you gonna come around here and murder me tonight?

Chorus

(Bombshell)
See me, I'm the type of nigga that's gonna get down for mine
I don't be sayin' too much, I light the spark and you dyin'
I ain't lyin', these old bustas they be spyin' on me
They got they muthafuckin' mind on me, they tryin' to be
The one and only, muthafucka to stop
This here, what I'm doin', I ain't never had shit
So I ain't gone let you ruin
Bombshell on the rise
Look into my eyes
You'z a I know that you know what I'm talkin' bout
Nashville, New Orleans, niggas ridin' clean
And nigga ain't talkin' bout nothin' bitch what the fuck you mean?
Baby Capone tell Brady get them tones
We bringin' it on
My nigga we in a War Zone
My gun is ready to bust
Ain't too many I'm ready to trust
Sharp clique, represent
On your head I leave a nick
Hold tight, 'fore you don't make it through the night
You bullshittin', you must don't value your life

Chorus
