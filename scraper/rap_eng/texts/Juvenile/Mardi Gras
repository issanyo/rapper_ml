Two breeds my daughter
Up town my words up
I'm amped up and I'm chosed up
I stunt too, my car's up
Got plenty hoes, my broad's up
Champagne on my dog's uh
A snot nose I bossed up
I staged rap and my car's up
Bring it back
Two breeds my daughter
Up town my words up
I'm amped up and I'm chosed up
I stunt too, my car's up
Got plenty hoes, my broad's up
Champagne on my dog's uh
A snot nose I bossed up
I staged rap and my car's up
I lose some and I win some
You cock-blocking my income
Don't howl a lot in my ear drum
Cause rules break, I bent some
Seen threats, I meant 'em
No stress no tension
Chest up no flitching
Old dog no pension
I move work at jet speed
This rap shit my pet peeve
I smoke sum of the best weed
Your bitch on my testies
The fan chose their best leads
Won't lock me, won't X me
It's more of y'all and less of me
I bash it don't threat me
Bejamin's in my pockets
Credit card in my wallet
Every day I make a little profit
It's not tricking the hoes if I got it
I bounce back hydraulic
Make noise sole in my body
I keep my hands on my shottie
Run up on you boys

My root's strong like oak trees
I'm sky high like nose bleeds
Now get away from my dough please
Just go please

Bed time, no wonder
If it catch me, that's my shit
They keep a real with no hoe shit
They can't chew that show shit
That's up town, that's down town
That'z Z spank, that's what spank
At seaside, that's what side
It's going on nigga let's drink
Slow it down I can't do
I'm old school like chateaus
I'm cracked up in my plamo
You looking broke in them chair clothes
Your name shot, no game shot
Now what the hell you gonna tell hoes?
You dirty like a motel floor
You need to lotion those elbows

All these women acting like strippers
They want to show me their titties
They like throw me something please mister
Benjamin's in my pockets
