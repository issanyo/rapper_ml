[Intro: Aretha Franklin]
Trey, this is Aretha believe in yo self
Believe in your dreams, don't let no
Body tell you what you can't do
You gonna make it, yeah

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
This song is for my shawty
That's going through it, you gotta know you can do it
And this song is for my homies
Just hold it down 'cause get it from the ground up

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
'Cause I tried suit with a smile, it ain't fit me
And I played the blocked for a while, them people tried to kill me
No matter what you go through
I know one thing is true, keep believing and you'll

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
'Cause when it's feeling like you just can't take it
And no matter what you do, ooh they keep hating
Lift your head up to the sky, tell yourself I
Just gotta make it, I just gotta make it
'Cause when it's feeling like you just can't take it
And no matter what you do, ooh they keep hating
Lift your head up to the sky, tell yourself I
Just gotta make it, I just gotta make it

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Shawty I know you 'bout to have your baby
Before you give up just take a second lady
Look in the mirror, your reflection baby
It's perfection baby, don't neglect it baby
Now homie, I know you been nickling and diming
Can't get enough hours at your job to put your time in
I know them streets looking good and that money looking long
Gon' and get how you live, who am I to say you wrong?

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
'Cause I tried suit with a smile, it ain't fit me
And I played the blocked for a while, them people tried to kill me
No matter what you go through
I know one thing is true, keep believing and you'll

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
'Cause when it's feeling like you just can't take it
And no matter what you do, ooh they keep hating
Lift your head up to the sky, tell yourself I
Just gotta make it, I just gotta make it
'Cause when it's feeling like you just can't take it
And no matter what you do, ooh they keep hating
Lift your head up to the sky, tell yourself I
Just gotta make it, I just gotta make it

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
Man I done slept in the hallways but I didn't cry through
Was advanced for my learning but was all caught in the cycle
What I wore in the daytim iIs what I wore for my night-clothes
Concern about a mil when I should have been shuttin' my eyes closed
Know about the stones, whack old wheels and the pot holes
Wanna call 'em Barry Bus, eatin' good with the nachos
If I ain't got nothin', I got flow, small carryin' a block glow
Just keep on grindin', don't pay atention to these pot holes
And you can make a come up, makin' moves in the Hummer
And you bring the children down to DisneyWorld this summer
I done been to hell and back, that's why I changed my life
Been caught up and convicted for the same thing twice
Mama preachin' to me to get my mindframe right
They found two on my partners' bodies on the same night
If I was with them then I would be on the same plane
I was livin' in this dump so I changed my life

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Looking at you day after day, I know I
Just gotta make it, I just gotta make it
Just to see that smile up on your face, I know I
Just gotta make it, I just gotta make it
Everything I do, I do for you and we
Just gotta make it, we just gotta make it
To the top of the world me and my girl we
Just gotta make it, just gotta make it, just gotta make it

[Outro: Aretha Franklin & Trey Songz]
Just as long as you ain't stepping on nobody
That's the Queen of soul
Tryna get where you going
She paved the way from me
Hang in there, hang tough when you have to
You're gonna make it
Can I make it?
You're gonna make it, yeah
I know, yeah yeah, I'm gonna make it
I know I'm gonna make it 'retha
