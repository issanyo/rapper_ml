You don't really want it with me, hope me fall back
Got a Louie V snuggage at the door, but I'll fall back
Anybody can get it, the sort that you don't care
For the slightest disrespect you gonna be wheat and load at
Fall back, fall back, fall back, fall back
If a nigga disrespect me I'm a beat him all black
Fall back, fall back, fall back, fall back
If a nigga disrespect me I'm a beat him all black
Oh, man, you like the TV, every time you see me
I thought you be keeping gee, but you've been listening to your CD
Trying to be like the Bee Gees, that's why you wanna be eli
I don't see you no 3d, I put your pictures on daily
You got bitch in your blood and I can see how you're acting
You don't wanna be thought, a lot of you niggas riding
I see you showing your mug, but you ain't fin to do nothing
Please, don't give me no problems, you'll probably end on my game
I'm in the streets and you're hiding, I'm the hardest fucker you're caught in
I pull up with that yap and popping their eyes stopping
There's some hating by minute, but losing is not an option
Take a baby away from a mother like an adoption
Treat him like onions and bail peppers that chopped him
You try to leave by the building, I got you blocked in
You know a few people and now you figure your life in
You don't want see me in block, stay off the block, then
You don't really want it with me, hope me fall back
Got a Louie V snuggage at the door, but I'll fall back
Anybody can get it, the sort that you don't care
For the slightest disrespect you gonna be wheat and load at
Fall back, fall back, fall back, fall back
If a nigga disrespect me I'm a beat him all black
Fall back, fall back, fall back, fall back
If a nigga disrespect me I'm a beat him all black
Nigga is the new bitch of yesterday, say what?
'Cause nigga if you be gangsta being hit from the back
Now that you got a clip is this supposed to be it?
Is James Tiger in my flow or is supposed to be that?
Bitch, I got a gangsta disease so don't stay close to me black
I murder people around the nation, I just now that they're back
So if you're seeing me mugging with my four head bulldog
Yeah, that's when I have finances and police is been caught up
I'll be whipe and blood up my Gucci linsday
You don't like the lesbians, that man ain't got no membrane
I wear my pride on my shoulders and my heart on my sleeves
In case I hold you ever see, I'm a part of the streets
Been a man support by nature since I started to breathe
Guns to be, I ain't got to take my talking with me
Fuck your whole block, bitch I'm from the West, so nigga what?
Mixed everything in my body, now pistol what?
You don't really want it with me, hope me fall back
Got a Louie V snuggage at the door, but I'll fall back
Anybody can get it, the sort that you don't care
For the slightest disrespect you gonna be wheat and load at
Fall back, fall back, fall back, fall back
If a nigga disrespect me I'm a beat him all black
Fall back, fall back, fall back, fall back
If a nigga disrespect me I'm a beat him all black
Bet you have those black masks, black boots in night
Wanna be in these four door
Murder game in the band, and there I handle my beat in solo
Yeah, I'm in with the robber davis, torture niggas in slow-mo'
Two two three is be like adenis, your mouth is where the mouse goes
Huss I'm leaving with beefing, you won't leave 'till your blood bleeds
I won't tell them to fall back, I tell them to fall deep
I'm right from them my freaks, they're going from all, hey
The one they fuck with, probably why they're all scared
Niggas know that I ate that one
If I pull a bullet, better get that gun
Drop full of heat, fresh up the fun
Ak set full of shit, done
It don't matter where you're from
My respect can get attached
Asshole, but nice, I'm k
Bitch, I'm a conduct the sun
I got more niggas than a millionaire money
The shit that hits you in July turn it to fall with your body parts
Why you niggas playing to me, searching for a hoit
I'm precastle but home is still, definition of perfect oil
You don't really want it with me, hope me fall back
Got a Louie V snuggage at the door, but I'll fall back
Anybody can get it, the sort that you don't care
For the slightest disrespect you gonna be wheat and load at
Fall back, fall back, fall back, fall back
If a nigga disrespect me I'm a beat him all black
Fall back, fall back, fall back, fall back
If a nigga disrespect me I'm a beat him all black
