[Intro: Nef The Pharaoh]
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Yeah, ah, yeah, yeah, ah, yeah, yeah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharaoh]
G-Eazy took me out the hood and on tour for four months
It's big bruh, made a call and I showed up
Never look back, Life changed, I glowed up
I'm that fly ass lil' nigga in that Escalade truck
I went from borrowing shoes to buying the whole store
I walk in the club iced up, I'm 'bout to show out
[?], well I'mma talk my shit
10 bands [?]
I was eating Ruth Chris with Ruth in two [?]
I'm served like toothpicks, dick with D'usse
Are you tryna be a big time and you ain't need big time?
Are you tryna be at the top when you ain't even been down?
[?] I'm the chosen one with my people around
And I'd die for all my niggas really holding me down
I slay for all my killas really making me proud
I'm here writing you wrong I got my niggas for life

[Hook: Nef The Pharaoh]
For jailhouse niggas, it's bread for life
But I'mma beat the system, I'mma spread some life
Then watch my niggas get bread for life
While my niggas getting bread for life
I'm on, I'mma put you on
Now that I'm on, I'mma put you on
Now that I'm on, I'mma put you on
Now that I'm on, I'mma put you on
(Put your ass on)

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
If the homie on his ass, break bread with 'em
But never let 'em put you in a ring with 'em
Tell 'em what they do to you on [?]
Tell 'em what they do to you on [?] (Oh)
I'mma [?] bailout nigga
On a [?], just tell me where your whereabouts, nigga
[?] banging till you get out's, nigga
Black stack market, I be selling shares out, nigga
I'm on fire, I'm so hot, I'm about to pass out
I'm the only man that bring the Summer in December
You wonder why I carry guns as far as you remember
'Cause I can do a lot but I don't know how to surrender
Hold man
Nigga I ain't selfish, 'cause all my niggas ballers
They was on a [?] first, I turned them into [?]
Was it for the pussy, though, we had the most regardless
Well, ask my ex's about it they gon' say he's talking garbage

[Hook: Nef The Pharaoh]
For jailhouse niggas, it's bread for life
But I'mma beat the system, I'mma spread some life
Then watch my niggas get bread for life
While my niggas getting bread for life
I'm on, I'mma put you on
Now that I'm on, I'mma put you on
Now that I'm on, I'mma put you on
Now that I'm on, I'mma put you on
(Put your ass on)
For jailhouse niggas, it's bread for life
But I'mma beat the system, I'mma spread some life
Then watch my niggas get bread for life
While my niggas getting bread for life
(I'mma put your ass on
I'mma put your ass on
I'mma put your ass on
I'mma put your ass on)
