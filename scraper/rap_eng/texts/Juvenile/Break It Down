(feat. Q Corvette)
[Intro]
Don't stop now get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it
Don't stop now get it get it
Get it get...

[Chorus: Q Corvette]
Look at how she movin, look at how she do it
Pop and know they payin, stayin workin her booty
But shorty's a winner, she ain't no beginner
Just look at the way she make her ass go up
She loves to break it down, break it down (down down down)
(Breakin it down) Break it down, break it down (she breakin it down)
She loves to break it down, break it down (down down down)
(Breakin it down) Break it down, break it down (she breakin it down)

M.J. girl right here "I'm Bad"
Fuck that nigga right there, he fag!
What'chu lookin for girl I'm on
And I ain't gotta tell you shit but I'm grown
Don't stop now, get it get it
Want dick right now HA! Just admit it
As Lord is the witness
When times comes, I'ma give you the business
Left right then jack that juice
All you can say is big daddy is good
I can have you in my steak
You can be a side dish on my plate
And I just ate and I'm still not straight
You could be the judge bitch hear my case!
I ain't talkin 'bout your girl right there
But your girl right there

[Chorus]
[Q Corvette]
She be all on the ground
She be poppin it and splittin like the circus in town
If that's your girl then oh my bad (my bad)
Just tryin to hold that ass (that ass)
It's amazing how she make it go
Rounnnnnnnnd
[Juvenile]
Shawty what you drinkin?
I wanna feel yo' brain, get in yo' thinkin
Later on let's lengthen
And just tell me the #, I don't need no ink pen
Yo' booty talk like reverends
And I just cain't pass my blessing
Everybody in the club's got questions
But ooh girl just keep 'em guessing
And get low my dear
Niggas is broke but not right chea
Not me, you got me wrong
I still got money from the "Bling Bling" song
Yeah! I got old (Ca$h Money)
Fuckin with me'll get you more (Ca$h Money)
I ain't talkin 'bout your girl right there
But your girl right there

[Chorus]
[Outro]
Her ass go round and round
Forward back up and down
And when she back it up
Beep beep she make that truckin sound
Her ass go round and round
Forward back up and down
I ain't talkin 'bout her right there
But her right there (look at how she move it)
