Can't you tell we about to take over the indusrty
And lock this motherfucka up like penitentiary
If u don't know nobody else you don't know C.M.B

With golds on my front teeth, front teeth

Always saggin' never catch me with a suit on

Who give me mean mugs got niggas who down now ride wit me
Hit a block wit Glocks and start a riot wit me
For Turk my nigga-Baby-drive change on your soldeirs
Got niggas all over knock your head of your shoulder
