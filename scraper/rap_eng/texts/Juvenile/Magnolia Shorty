Magnolia Shorty
Magnolia Shorty
Shorty, Shorty
Magnolia Shorty
Shorty, shorty
Magnolia

[Verse 1: Juvenile]
Betrayal, for the decline in drug sales
War over turf here will cause more drama than Waco
That's why I lay low, and try to improvise on all your weak spots
See what the street got
For me, maybe two cheap Glocks
For free, Benjamin Franklin, currency
Which is used to pay bills and insurance to bury me
I'm magna to carta player haters don't bother me
Y'all ought to be, rollin' shipments instead of quarter ki's
It was told to me
Cash Money connect from overseas
Two tons of white ones and maybe
But then they might come so I'ma
Take preparation
Pick out a proper stash location
Fill it with choppers and watch them
Narcotic cases, undercovers investigatin'
Yo' Russ, where the man with the dope?
I'm startin' to get impatient
Two days blew by, our package arrived
Followed by, a call from the boss for me to do a homicide

[Verse 2: Magnolia Shorty & B.G.]
Chillin' in my hood, while you know it's all good
Camouflaged down to the socks with some soldier Reeboks
I got's to play it like that, 'cause I'm a soldier for real
I told you once I'm with a soldier, bitch, you 'bout to get killed
That's the deal for '96, 'cause you know we ain't playin'
Go and run and get it, now, you better throw up your hands
And if you stunt, you know I'll catch you, know what I mean?
Slip on them chucks in the cut, at that C.Y.C
Magnolia soldier, don't you doubt it, I thought you knew we bout it
A bunch of bout it muthafuckas, smoke weed and get, out it
Throw your head up stand tall, and stand big and fuckin' loaded
I'ma represent where I'm from, the home of the soldiers

[Verse 3: B.G.]
B.G. off the top bout drama
And I'ma, duct tape a nigga Mama
Forgot her
Cuz I, be off in the World gat tore
G's I'm bout 4, S.K. clips I unload
I'm floatin' all through that U.P.T.,
Represent V.L. street slangin' heat, you weak
A T-shirt with your face on it
I find out where your set at, I run up on it
Meet us outside, you know that's All On U
They all die ain't no stuntin', do what I gotta do
Game tight when I write, write get a nigga hype
Niggas buckin' through the crowd, startin' a war fight
Pop, pop clear the block
Your Glocks ain't cocked
I make the spot hot, jump out and straight chop
Respect the young nigga, get plum dumb nigga
Shots comin' from drums, nigga who want beef with me?
If you want beef, then brang it
I don't just sang it, gunshots be rangin'
Money and bitches, houses and fly cars
Rottweilers in the yard, also security guards
Big money heavyweight, got ki's and G's
Got cake for days, give it to the B.G.'z
I keep it real this life, a straight muthafuckin' solja
We puttin' tons of coke in the Magnolia

[Outro]
