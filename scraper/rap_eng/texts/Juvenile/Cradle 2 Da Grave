[Hook x2]
We ain't got a worry in our head
Whatever beef we had already dead
We running shit, that's right, that's what I said
And it's official from the cradle to the grave like

[Verse 1]
Apartment, it's coming out of Austin
I'm on my way to home on a private charter from Boston
Niggas already talking, these bitches already stalking
I bigger the jack is coming, I'm balling so I'm a target
I got that 911 if you want it, bring out your coffin
These niggas gon get you twisted and floating like you're a dolphin
And they ain't got no other or better shit on the market
All you niggas selling garbage
Go put that shit in the toilet and flush it
You know why they don't school from you no more cause they don't trust it
You had some loyal customers but now they all disgusted
I pop up out of nowhere with that fire like surprise
When you see me in the club, me and my niggas looking fly like

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I'm out here in the thuggin, don't worry me for nothing
Say you don't believe in God today you gon' believe in something
My niggas in there with me, they buckets twisting to be famous
They searchers at the door but we still in here with them bangers
Security can't control us, can't hold us, they can't contain us
A couple had to quit cause they said this shit was too dangerous
I'm a while dope and I smoke like a Californian
And I don't want your hoe but I fucked her cause I was on it
Dope won't sell itself shit, it don't need no advertisement
They running back and forth I got these bitches exercising
Bought shit from over seas, they say it's 'ganistan
And I got that flavor everybody want, it's [?]
