Verse 1 )
Chilling by my ho house
She told me I smoked too much
Ho, what you watching me for?
Look bitch, go out and do some
Crackhead  trying to sco' some
I just found out he straight feds
Convictions on his whole house
But he got out in 8 days
His mama was a dope fiend
His daddy was a OG
They found him in the dope house, he had too much, he OD’d
They found his little stash box
He told em that was my shit
They showed up at my front door’
I told em that was gossip
Didn't know what they was up to
So I got on my defense
And running to the police
Ain't even in my sequence
I don’t give a fuck though
Cause ya’ll ain't got no case bitch
And ya’ll ain't got no witness
Cause a dead nigga can’t say shit
Just got me some new land
Then I built a new fence
Warning to you white folks
Nigga’s bout to move in
Got my package this morning
Finished it by noon time
I still got my ’02 Benz
I just went and bought that new kind

(Hook)
I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, it’s all good woa)
I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, I’m 100 homie)
I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, it’s all good ho)
I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, it’s how I do it ho)

(Verse 2)
These bills too much to handle
Mama calling ANO
She’s bout to lose her Section 8, police ran in the back door’
Landlord saying move out
Road on took a new route
Plus she gotta come up with  deposit for a new house
I gotta get it ‘fore we all be on the curb
And all I got in this world is my balls and my word
I swear she gotta get hers or you gonna get yours
And I pray I don’t die cause lord knows I’m not insured
Prada Gang, them troops out
Time we let the truth out
They lying through they teeth so much they knocking they own tooth out
Showed up at the court house, I think I need to confess
How I’m killing these bitches, place me under arrest
She want a upgrade, I say first pass this quick test
I gave her A for her ass and a B for her breast
You know she blew that flute huh ?
You gave that ho the boot huh ?
That’s why you got that Buddha
I’m good at what I do hah

(Hook)
I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, it’s all good woa)
I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, I’m 100 homie)
I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, it’s all good ho)
I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, it’s how I do it ho)

(Verse 3)
I was at my car wash when LIL homie rolled up
He said Skip help me, I was in The hold up
What this look like ER ?, my life is like a sea saw
Why you come run, bring all that heat on me for?
Look, here come the police, now I’m fucked with no grease
Whip their guns out, screaming like they want beef
Then lil homie broke out
Fuck it then, I broke too
And the cops came, it turned into a pursuit
I caught up with lil homie
He told me I was tripping
He started to run again
When he did – I clipped him
The police watched the whole thing
We just ran bout 2 blocks
They cuffed us and they searched us
Then they found 2 rocks
Let me guess who this for
Guess for what? It ain't mine
I work at the car wash, I’m doing just quite fine
We gone go check yo spot
Then we gonna lock up
It’s been 15 minutes, my niggas cleaned the shop up

(Hook)
I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, it’s all good woa)
I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, I’m 100 homie)
I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, it’s all good ho)
I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, it’s how I do it ho)
