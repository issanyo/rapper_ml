J-U-V-E, no breed, no other like me
Fans like is he really gonna drop that?
Point of degree, you ain't never gonna top that
He ain't the same but he still got flo'
Guess I gotta flo', just a little bit mo'

It's gonna be a Juvie nation, call this rejuvenation
It's too much of the fake out
Gotta get the real out before they stake out
Put the kids in the safe house
Cake out, pull the champ and the stakes out

I am my dreams, my plans
Lemme in, lemme in, goddamn
Still alone, my shit, lil' nigga, whatchu mean? I quit
If you a Pitbull, I'm Mike Vick
I'll bury your ass right quick

It's early in the morning, y'all sleepin', I'm moanin'
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
It's early in the morning, y'all sleepin', I'm moanin'
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

You don't want none, there won't be none
You stop acting like a bitch you won't be one
You don't want none, there won't be none
You stop acting like a bitch you won't be one

Right now I just wanna say to everyone
That I appreciate the fact that y'all took a little time
Out of your business schedule to go and get the album
And I promise you'll love the sound and the quality of this motherfucker
You understand me, Juve

N-O-L-A, niggas droppin' like flies everyday
Who's next? Can't say
Gotta cover my dough, I can't play
Be smart, you could move more weight
Be sharp, you could lose your face

It's like that when they hate you
Gotta show 'em you're a ape too
Handle business in the night and the day too
A big dog in the hood, how they rate you

A beast like me, I'm G
Real as the Buddha in front of my I.D
MAG 3
Watch me, y'all follow my lead

My hood, my scent
I can't leave, it might be in my debt
Watcha mean leave? Nigga, not yet
I ain't ready, I ain't seen my check

It's early in the morning, y'all sleepin', I'm moanin'
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
It's early in the morning, y'all sleepin', I'm moanin'
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

You don't want none, there won't be none
You stop acting like a bitch you won't be one
You don't want none, there won't be none
You stop acting like a bitch you won't be one
