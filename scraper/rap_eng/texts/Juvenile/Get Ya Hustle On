That's right, it's crunch time now fellas
No time to be cryin for momma now, it's the movement
C'mon

To all my people on them corners I consider as dogs
I wish I could break a package down and send it to y'all
I know ya feelin me behind them penitentiary walls
Put me on the visit list and I'll be in to see y'all
Talk to 'em - your mayor ain't your friend, he's the enemy
Just to get your vote, a saint is what he pretend to be
Fuck him! Ah-listen to me, I got the remedy
Save your money up and find out who got 'em for 10 a ki'
Bubble, if you don't hustle don't use your energy
Cause you gon' be a cellmate or wind up as a memory
Yeah, and I could give a fuck if you kin to me
My life is up and down and side to side like a centipede

[Hook]
Get ya hustle on, nigga get ya hustle on {*4X*}
We take the Pyrex and then we rock with it, roll with it
Take the Pyrex and then we rock with it, roll with it!
We take the Pyrex and then we rock with it, roll with it
Take the Pyrex and then we rock with it, roll with it!

The loamin hard sparkle like glass
Main bitch right behind me lookin sharp in the Jag
Security say you don't know me so I talk to 'em bad
If a nigga want somethin I got somethin for his ass
Choppers - I'm already knowin that it's a G thang
Ever since they tried to drown a nigga on the East Bank
Everybody need a check from FEMA
So he can go and sco' him some co-ca-llina
Get money! And I ain't gotta ball in the Beemer
Man I'm tryin to live, I lost it all in Katrina (damn)
And nobody cares what the police thank
Everybody fuckin with ki's cause it's a street thang

Wodie! You really feelin your folks
Just them crackers behind them desk-es that ain't hearin us though
We starvin! We livin like Haiti without no government
Niggas killin niggas and them bitches is lovin it
Fuck Fox News! I don't listen to y'all ass
Couldn't get a nigga off the roof when the storm passed
Talkin - y'all comfortable right now to your own land
'Til a nigga catch ya down bad, starvin and want cash
Get your mind right, nigga get your money up
You're movin a little somethin, but you ain't done enough
Fo' shizzle - you know the boss gonna want a cut
Yeahhhhhh - or the boss gon' haveta fuck you up

[Hook] - repeat 2X
