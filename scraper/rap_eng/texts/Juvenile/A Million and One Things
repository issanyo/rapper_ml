[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
What
This.. this here's real, nigga
It's real, nigga
Too real
Pay attention even though I'm young, nigga
Look, look
This one here's on tha up, dog
For all my people with bad luck, dog
Strugglin', tryin' ta make a buck, dog
For all tha peeps who ain't with us, dog
For all my niggas in Angola, stay tough, dog
See, this from shorty on tha real
I'm tired of seein' my niggas gettin' killed
They hustlin' for a mil, nigga, hustle for your bills
If ya think ya need help, holla at me, wodie, I'm trill
If I got it ta spend, then I got it to give
But listen, man.. I know ya see the ice glistenin', man
I know it make you wanna go get it bad
But ya gotta think 'fore ya move, partna
'Cause it'll make your ship sink and you will lose, partna
I know you hate ta take it from a young nigga like me
But I betcha can't name one nigga like me
That's why I'm tryin' ta preach, my nigga
And teach, my nigga
If ya don't work ya don't eat, my nigga

[Chorus: Juvenile]
They got a million and one things that you could be doin'
Than hangin' around this motherfucker talkin' to your children
Get off your ass, lil' daddy, and go and get it
It's starin' at ya right in your face, you ain't wit it
They got a million and one things that you could be doin'
Than hangin' around this motherfucker talkin' to your children
Get off your ass, lil' daddy, and go and get it
It's starin' at ya right in your face, you ain't wit it

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
Look at ya, you're fuckin' up and I can tell it too
What is ya smokin'? Everything a nigga sellin' you?!
I know you could do better than that, and deserve more
Ya use to be tight with your game back in '84
All tha hoes use ta jock ya
Niggas use ta knock ya
Stay a big shot, motherfucker couldn't stop ya
Then ya went ta runnin' 'round tha project with them junkies
Holes in your shoes, and your body all funky
Lips all ashy, eyes popped out
Spendin' your children check, takin' food out they mouth
And you get mad with me 'cause I don't wanna give you ten
I don't support your habit, nigga, y'all grown men
I got kids ta feed, I got bills ta pay
I got people comin' askin' for shit everyday
I can't please everybody, but I love my folks
If I give ya everything, baby, I'ma be broke

[Chorus: Juvenile]
They got a million and one things that you could be doin'
Than hangin' around this motherfucker talkin' to your children
Get off your ass, lil' daddy, and go and get it
It's starin' at ya right in your face, you ain't wit it
They got a million and one things that you could be doin'
Than hangin' around this motherfucker talkin' to your children
Get off your ass, lil' daddy, and go and get it
It's starin' at ya right in your face, you ain't wit it

[Verse 3: Turk]
Look... look.. look
Where I stay, times is hard for a lot of my peeps
Some of my rounds doin' bad.. can't even much eat
Every time I pass through, beggin' me for a dollar
Thinkin' I owe them somethin', don't even wanna holla
Nigga who use ta be ballin' ain't ballin' no mo'
I can see they life fadin' away slowly for sure
Niggas who I come up with get me full of that dope
Use ta care about theyself, ain't care no mo'
Niggas want me ta help 'em.. ain't helpin' theyself
You must be out your mind if you ain't helpin' yourself
Ain't no love loss... I just gotta stay my distance
Gotta keep my mind straight.. before I come up missin'
Gotta do my rap thing, and make my paper, mister
Ain't gon' let nobody stop me from gettin' my six figures
Gettin' my shine on, bling-blingin' everyday
If you're not for tha right, stay tha fuck out my way, nigga

[Chorus: Juvenile]
They got a million and one things that you could be doin'
Than hangin' around this motherfucker talkin' to your children
Get off your ass, lil' daddy, and go and get it
It's starin' at ya right in your face, you ain't wit it
They got a million and one things that you could be doin'
Than hangin' around this motherfucker talkin' to your children
Get off your ass, lil' daddy, and go and get it
It's starin' at ya right in your face, you ain't wit it

[Verse 4: B.G.]
Every time I hit tha block, it look like it get worse
Make me wonder if V.L. and Magnolia got a curse
My niggas still my niggas... got love for 'em all
I hate to see that market ride they back and make 'em fall
Somebody tell me, if I didn't have change and I was broke
Would I get tha same attention when I'm in tha next four-door
No, I don't think so, I'll be a equal nigga
On the set, smokin' jo's, beggin' people for scrilla
On the reala... if I could do it, then you could
Lay your hustle down and make your way out the hood
Ain't nobody gon' give no hand-outs, I swear
Ain't nobody gon' pay tha bills in your house, I swear
They don't care, ya gotta stand on your own, my nigga
You ain't no child, look in tha mirror, you're grown, my nigga
Do yourself a favor: leave tha heroin alone, my nigga
And get your hustle on, nigga, get it on, my nigga

[Chorus: Juvenile]
They got a million and one things that you could be doin'
Than hangin' around this motherfucker talkin' to your children
Get off your ass, lil' daddy, and go and get it
It's starin' at ya right in your face, you ain't wit it
They got a million and one things that you could be doin'
Than hangin' around this motherfucker talkin' to your children
Get off your ass, lil' daddy, and go and get it
It's starin' at ya right in your face, you ain't wit it
They got a million and one things that you could be doin'
Than hangin' around this motherfucker talkin' to your children
Get off your ass, lil' daddy, and go and get it
It's starin' at ya right in your face, you ain't wit it
They got a million and one things that you could be doin'
Than hangin' around this motherfucker talkin' to your children
Get off your ass, lil' daddy, and go and get it
It's starin' at ya right in your face, you ain't wit it

[Outro: Juvenile]
Man, you could be out here tryin' ta do somethin', man
I mean every time we come through, man, I do somethin' for my people, man
I give tha little kids a dollar or so, ya know what I'm sayin'
I try ta do things for tha football team
Try ta take care of my people
Try ta show them how ta help theyself
'Cause they got a lot of problems
