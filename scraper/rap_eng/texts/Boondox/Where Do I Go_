Would I be better off laid in a six foot hole
A body rotting eyes closed with no conscious or a soul
Never knowing never feeling with no memories of being
Only ashes laid to ashes never loving never seeing
Just a corpse and of course there'd be no rising of the dead
No apocalypse of zombies and no cracking open heads
With no eating of the brains because I couldn't stand the pain
Pitch black nothin zerod just a head stone and a name

I dont know where I'm gon go but when I get there they gon know
Im wicked and I run the show and I'm wicked and I'm a juggalo
And I'm swingin swingin hatchets while I'm screamin psychopathic
And I'm wicked and I run the show and I'm wicked and I'm a juggalo

Would I be better off in flames and burnin for eternity
And should the evil that I'm doin really be concernin me
And should I bite my tongue and never seen to walk a righteous path
Or will I feel the devils pitchfork stickin in my righteous ass
Wake up to the smells off flesh slowly burnin like a pinner
Listen to the screams of sinners roastin like a chicken dinner
Everyday in hell the temperature would be a fuckin scorcher
And everyday in hell a new experience in human torcher

When I die I dont know where I'm gonna be but I know its a one way ticket
And when I die idk where I wanna be but I know that ill stay wicked

I dont know where I'm gon go but when I get there they gon know
Im wicked and I run the show and I'm wicked and I'm a juggalo
And I'm swingin swingin hatchets while I'm screamin psychopathic
And I'm wicked and I run the show and I'm wicked and I'm a juggalo

Would I be better off with streets of gold a halo angels wings
Floatin like a bodom cloud just chillin while a choir sings
And every single female big ol booty sportin double ds
Quick to take a dick and on command be blowin like a breeze
Never beein broke or feelin sick and liquor on tap
Pac and biggy droppin by to ask me 'where the weed at?'
Call it shangri la or heaven I just hope they listenin
And even though that hell is callin pray for me they let me in

I dont know where I'm gon go but when I get there they gon know
Im wicked and I run the show and I'm wicked and I'm a juggalo
And I'm swingin swingin hatchets while I'm screamin psychopathic
And I'm wicked and I run the show and I'm wicked and I'm a juggalo

And when I die idk where I wanna be but I know that ill stay wicked

I dont know where I'm gon go but when I get there they gon know
Im wicked and I run the show and I'm wicked and I'm a juggalo
And I'm swingin swingin hatchets while I'm screamin psychopathic
And I'm wicked and I run the show and I'm wicked and I'm a juggalo

I'm wicked
