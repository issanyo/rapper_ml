Godforsaken left to rot an orphaned bastard child
Mutated product born of incest left out in the wild
A bloody bastard lies abandoned still tied to the cord
Opens his eyes to see more darkness in an evil world
So much pain filled with hate it shapes his simple mind
Don't know how don't know why no sense of days no sense of time
All he knows is what he sees and that's the beast of fame
Rippin' flesh kill to survive embedded in his fuckin' brain
Raised by the woods provided goods enough for sure survival
No way to read but in his hands he totes a tattered bible
He doesn't have a name but in his soul's just pure conviction
He knows there's more like him and they gon' pay for his affliction

There ain't gon be no sequel
This here is inbred evil
Everybody must die
Everybody must die
Everybody must die

There ain't gon be no sequel
This here is inbred evil
Everybody must die
Everybody must die
Everybody must die

Like canopies all the trees provide the perfect cover
Hikers bikers campers steamed up windows from the youngest lovers
Unaware of the eyes that watch just waitin' patient
Licks his lips and grins excited droolin' heart is fuckin' racing
So many lost on these roads and trails that lead out here
Slaughtered ripped to pieces open stomachs like a baby deer
You see the fear on the faces like they starin' at hell
Flies and maggots feastin' on remains a putrid fuckin' smell
And in the distance yards away another shadow lights
Gutted like a fish up in the hidden shadows covered like
Another crime scene just like a couple hundred others
Naked left to day out in the open wait to be discovered

There ain't gon' be no sequel
This here is inbred evil
Everybody must die
Everybody must die
Everybody must die

There ain't gon' be no sequel
This here is inbred evil
Everybody must die
Everybody must die
Everybody must die

He's alone in the home his family left behind
On the couch his ma and pa are sittin' missin' eyes
Throughout the rooms and halls the story of a broken boy
Bodies line the walls in pairs each one they hold a broken toy
The smell that lingers every corner filled with pure disease
Entrails hung like Christmas lights they decorate the mantelpiece
A blackened gutted in the tub bubbles up like tar
The still remains mixed with brains pickled in a jar
Everywhere you look sickness fills this little shack
Fingers on the table placed as set up for a little snack
This is the product of a broken inbred situation
Proof that man is born evil been that way since our creation

There ain't gon' be no sequel
This here is inbred evil
Everybody must die
Everybody must die
Everybody must die

There ain't gon' be no sequel
This here is inbred evil
Everybody must die
Everybody must die
Everybody must die
