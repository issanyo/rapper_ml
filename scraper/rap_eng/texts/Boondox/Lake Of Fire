I was sitting on the bank looking right in the flames. Heard these demons screaming at me
They keep calling my name. Am I alive? Am I dead? Tell me what's the situation?
Could what I'm staring at become my final destination? I don't know what it is but it's pullin me in
Am I Condemned to this lake for all of my sins? Or
Is it just a trick being played on my mind?
Eyes burned by fire now I'm forever blind

The lake of (FIRE)
Fire on the water don't burn my soul. Fire on the water won't let me go
Fire on the water don't burn my soul. Fire on the water won't let me go
Fire on the water don't burn my soul. Fire on the water won't let me go
Fire on the water don't burn my soul. Fire on the water won't let me go
