[Hook: Violent J]
Now I'm on the run; on the run from it all
I'd rather be shot dead then locked up with the law
I'm running... No place to hide
And I gotta leave my whole world behind me; my dog and my double wide

[Verse 1: Boondox]
You might call me pathetic; you might say that I've lost my mind
Sitting here in the driveway baby and clutching on a forty-five
But you did me so wrong and I can't say I understand
Now I'm about to blow your brains out bitch into the arms of another man
I caught you creeping and now you going to be sleeping
With the worms in the dirt, what the fuck was you thinking?
Do I look like the kind of motherfucker you can cheat on
You looking like a fucking whore I can beat on
But I never touch, never laid a single hand
Nor hair on your head, never touch a single strand
While I sitting here knowing what's about to happen
There going to get me for domestic because the pistol did the slappin'

[Hook: Violent J]
Now I'm on the run; on the run from it all
I'd rather be shot dead then locked up with the law
I'm running... No place to hide
And I gotta leave my whole world behind me; my dog and my double wide

[Verse 2: Boondox]
Standing here in our bedroom, with your body laid on the ground
Two dead motherfuckers looking silly with they blood sprayed all around
And I'm sitting here thinking where the fuck am I going to go
Burn the whole motherfucking trailer to the dirt and it's off to Mexico
Adios motherfuckers see you later
When I kicked in the door of a double wide trailer
And I saw your fucking titties steady bouncing like Hydraulics
And the next door neighbor had you folded like a wallet
And I got to really say I was kind of impressed
The way your heels of your feet was driving into your chest
And I hate to interrupt while he's giving it to you
The last thing you saw was his face in my boot

[Hook: Violent J]
Now I'm on the run; on the run from it all
I'd rather be shot dead then locked up with the law
I'm running... No place to hide
And I gotta leave my whole world behind me; my dog and my double wide

[Bridge: Boondox]
They ain't never gonna catch me, I won't do a lick of time
I'll live on a beach under an umbrella getting blow back sipping wine
And while your laid out burning, looking crispy like some KFC
Do a little soul searching motherfucker cause you never should've fucked with me

[Hook: Violent J]
Now I'm on the run; on the run from it all
I'd rather be shot dead then locked up with the law
I'm running... No place to hide
And I gotta leave my whole world behind me; my dog and my double wide
And I can't take nothing, nothing at all
Gotta leave my bucket, my toaster and my saw
Had a poster of Stone Cold still up on the wall
Had to leave town in a hurry, tell the police I said fuck y'all
