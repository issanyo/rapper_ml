[Verse 1]
I'm the first born child of a seventh born heathen
Had hell on my mind since I first started breathin'
I'm a sick mothafucker with a capital S
They need to call a mary mary because my life's a mess
I'm from the bottom of the barrel
Valley livin white trash in a 100 yard dash
I'm last place third class
I ain't never been shit and my outlook is grim
And my chances of survival are none to slim
I stay straight fucked up off whiskey and water
Fuckin farmers daughter in the back of Toyotas
Poppin so many pills that I piss codeine
My system ain't been clean since the age of 14
Hood rats fat back whiskey lovin' fat cats
Snortin' lines off of titties
Bustin' on they back tat trailer park
Livin' straight screen door junky
The mainstream hate me but the underground love me

[Hook]
Comin from nothin we livin the good life
Stay high just to make it but we goin be alright
Don't worry bout me cause bitch I'm free
And I'm gone
Keep shit wicked keep killin some bitches
Gon' get it how I get it this country fuckin livin

[Verse 2]
Country life try to fuck a skinny dike
Rush to the corner store drunk on a mini bike
That's how I do it never sober when I stay strapped
Shawty on my back and a rugile on my lap
You won't never wanna bring it to a killa from a dirt road
In a full of buckshot, throw off in a dirt hole
Kidnap your girlfriend and bring her to my pokin'
Before the night is over she'll be 'bout a heavy stroking
Just a couple pounds of xanies
Bring the bitches out they painties
I think that's how my pappy first got up wit my granny
Back wood mothafuckers don't give a fuck
Huntin' haters spotlight I'm in a pickup truck
Moonshine steady flowin' and my buzz keep grownin
Keep them rats out hoein while crows keep croakin'
Sit back on my porch and in joy what I'm givin'
Might seem fucked up but this is how I'm livin

[Hook]

[Bridge x9]
Country livin' keepin wicked
When you killin' all these sons of bitches
Never givin' in and they never
Get it because we keep it wicked

[Hook]
