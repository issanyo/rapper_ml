[Hook x2]
See the leaves falling to the ground
See them falling all around
On the cemetary mound

[Verse 1]
Teardrops on my notepad
Dope sick feels so bad
Everything seems so fucked up
I'm about to go mad
My life tried to live right
This night hope will end right
Hell's doors open wide
Inside here's your invite
One breath should I use it?
Life/Death should I choose it?
Legacy, life of me
Hear my voice in this music
Phone calls to a few peeps
No promises to keep
Close my eyes kiss the sky
And Then just go to sleep
So long tried to hold on
So long tried to stay strong
Everything that I know and grow
Now seems long gone
No more hearing "I should try"
No more wishing I would die
Close my eyes, let it go
And leave you with "Goodbye"

[Hook x2]

Everybodies gonna die some day [x2]

[Verse 2]
One love to all those
That got me through the lows
And stood by my side
And they came out to my shows
And gave me a reason
To pick up this hatchet
And run with the family
Scream Psychopathic
I wanna thank you for the time spent
You don't know how much it really meant
To have a family show love to a scrub
Who came up from shit
I hope you know that I give all
You show me how to always stand tall
Brought me from the grip of death
So know that I love yall

[Hook x4]

Everybodies gonna die some day [x2]

[Hook x3]

See the leaves falling to the ground
