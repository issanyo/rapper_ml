*Umm excuse me could you help me out?? Umm I lost the fuckin freeway and I'm tryin to find my way back. I guess I'm just a little bit lost.*

It was late one night in the 404
I was gone off that water chillin on the front porch
I was leaned back laxin and puffin on some swag
When a bitch came up in a tight ass jag
She pulled right in the driveway bumpin clint black
When she stepped out the ride I had to take a step back
She had long blonde hair and a ass that wouldn't quit
Titties fallin all out because the shirt didn't fit
Started walkin up to me then she drops the keys
Kneeled down to pick them up and all I saw was g-string
Pussy lips hangin out and it was the shit
Now I'm sprung on this bitch in a SJ6

Hey lady in my jaguar. How did you get you so much money?
What you doing down here, down there, round here?
Hey lady in the jaguar. Who you tryin to impress?
What you down here, down there, round here?

*Oh my god.. Umm excuse me Umm I'm not from around here and Umm I was wondering if you could hook a bitch up with some of that you know that really good, good, booger sugar?*

It was jumpin down town on a sat night
I was wipin car windows on a corner street light
She was parlay in a monte green jaguar
She locked her doors now what you do that for?
I could see she had a dead fox chillin on her shoulder
Blonde highlighted hair her face a little older
I knocked on her windshield and kissed the glass
I think I prolly scared a dune out her ass
But she peeled my wig back and offered me a ride
Smiled at a juggalo and told me get inside
I'm like hell yeah bitch you old rich freak
I went to get in, She peeled off and ran over my feet

*Oh my god my fuckin cell phone gets no signal, There's fuckin potholes everywhere and I'm just tryin to get me and the jaguar home okay?*

Oh shit who that rollin down the block
Another closet smoker lookin for some rock
And a jag pulled up and the window rolled down
I'm lookin for the infamous Shags The Clown
I tried to say what up but before I had the chance
I seen her camel toes tryin to push through her pants
So I said come here bitch she said what for?
She grabbed me by the pants and opened up the door
She pulled out her titties said she likes kinky stuff
And that if I wanted the neden I had to put on these handcuffs
She cuffed me to the seat Hey Yo What the hell?
She said I'm takin you in for jumpin your bail
