Be where you want to be
When you're doing what you want to do in your mind

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
We come harder than cement
The level that we get is untaintable to fuck with
We from beneath, from where your feet at
Every name end up, we'll call it, like Redman we gon' beat that

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Blood's runnin' from finger fucking
A drunk mother with a Freddy glove
And hoping that I could still fuck her
Fuck it she died, I never loved her inside
I got a problem but I keep it in the Underground

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
That dirty grimy on that other
Haters till death, y'all call us some wicked motherfuckers
The scarecrow, dead man, and the crimson twins
Resurrecting the Underground, so let it all begin

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
We're living just another day in their life
Of sharpening knives, I'm taking some lives
And removing the eyes
That's the only way to survive
When you fuck with the guys
Who could make the demons arise
In the name of the Underground

[Hook]
Still here, still holding it down
Screaming out loud, welcome to the Underground

We on the rise, this shit ain't no surprise
The Underground is killing shit and everybody dies

Just another day in their life
Of sharpening knives, I'm taking some lives
And we repping for the Underground

You know the deal, the Underground is real
If you ain't really feeling it then fuck how you feel

[Verse 5: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Welcome home, it's been way too long
The Underground ain't shit without me in it holmes
I am the dead zombie king, play with dead things
Build another box every time the bell rings
Crypt keeper, mask can make a full time life
Take a bet against the dead and off with your head
And off with your neck, now you're neckless
Don't ever step to me acting like you hard, talking reckless
Dark crown passed down for no one
Go ahead and get your guns, you can't hurt me son
I ain't moving from this spot, stay claimed to this plot
I'mma grow from the ashes like a phoenix back on top
So back on up, out the tomb I resume
It's game on and they label me a hell spawn
Product of nightmares brought to life
Worst fears, fed and in the shadows
See me I'm overhead

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Boondox]
This shit go deeper than my peter in a senorita
The Underground loyal, it just depend on how you treat her
And I don't ever hit it unless I know I'm smashing
If you come weak with it, then son you're never lasting
The scarecrow, my stare glow like high beams
Possess the fam like demons in my dreams
Then I leave my mark, just like hieroglyphics
The code to formula then rearranged into my specifics
The innovator of that down south dark shit
I got to writing scriptures, an underground Charlie Bartlett
And I don't ever want to see the sunlight
Bury me in darkness then I'll show you how it's done right
Lay my body down to sleep under the trees
And please let the word on my headstone read
Welcome to the place where sickness has been
If it ain't wicked we hit skip

[Hook]
