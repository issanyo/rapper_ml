[Verse 1]
Nobody move I got the Six shooter fully loaded
Finger like an automatic, bout to let it fuckin go
And take a bunch of lives, and I ain't leavin till I hit the door
Make a wrong move and watch these shell cases hit tha floor
An outlaw on the open range, and just like Jesse James
I rob these fools for change a Psychopathic Ombre with a price on my melon
For takin money from bitches and sendin' they spirits to heaven
I'm on an all black horse and in an all black cap
My pistol stay bad luck just like an all black cat
And I ain't playin with you motherfuckas, empty out the drawers
Take all the cheddar out the safe and I'll be out the fuckin door

[Hook]
Six shooter on my side, I'mma ride
They ain't never takin me alive, They never takin me alive
This is a life of an outlaw, hustlin, stealin, killin
And They never gonna get caught
Six shooter on my side, I'mma ride
They ain't never takin me alive, They never takin me alive
This is a life of an outlaw, hustlin, stealin, killin
And They never gonna get caught

[Verse 2]
Cold blooded murderer, wanted, fuckin price on my head
So high they had ta file a Chapter 7
See my face on every corner, don't you bring him back alive
Watch the tumbleweed hit tha streets soon as I arrived
Time to hit up the Saloon, shoot tha dude behind the bar
Grabbed a whole thing of Whiskey, then I lit up a cigar
Time for scopin out a hoe I need to get my dick sucked
I been ridin all day and now some hookers gettin fucked
I seen a bitch upon the stage and she was packin huge jugs
Up the stairs by hair then I beat the pussy up
She started screamin like a demon, put tha barrel in her mouth
Shot a load in her face and then I blew her fuckin brains out...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Marshalls on my ass, the lynch mob on to my trail
Just one thing upon they minds and that's for sendin me to hell
In an old pine box with no return stamped on tha top
It's gonna be a shoot em' up son, duck ya head, hear tha shots pop
I can't say nothin for the people I killed
My name carved up in a rock a hole dug in boot hill
This gonna be the fuckin day cause I can feel it in my bones
Twenty men with twenty guns about to send my ass home
Grab tha winchester, and it's on just like a switch
Now they taking many shots and I ain't dying like no bitch
Bullets hit me with precision, they won't get to see me fall
Bustin mutherfucking caps, pick em off screamin "outlaw!"

[Hook]

Six shooter on my side, I'mma ride
They ain't never takin me alive, never gonna get caught [x4]
Never Gonna Get Caught [x2]
Outlaw
