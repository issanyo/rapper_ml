[Verse 1: Boondox]
The fuse is lit and drowned in accelerant
Exposive situation and I am in my element
Fire, brimstone, bring it on, no testament
Everybody duck when the fan hits the excrement
I'm on a highway to Hell with no soul left to sell
The smell of sulfur got a motherfucker straight buzzin'
I'm locked and loaded, Lord I'm out of control
And I know that we are at the end and I'm ready for the second coming
Reconnect with the contact
And check another name off the list like a neurotic Saint Nick
I am the reaper, reaping, creeping up on demons
With an army full of heathens who are ready for the same shit
Apocalypse, it's time to purge
Death is in the air and I got the fucking urge
To bring them all to their knees
This is what they wanted make 'em bleed, motherfucker bleed

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
I will rid the world of all the hatred
By hating harder than anyone did
They keep me from trying to have a great life
They're always having me pulling my [?] away

[Verse 2: Boondox]
I never thought it would've come down to this
But there was never really way that we could ever exist
In a world full of people crushed up under a fist
They wanted puppets but it's time that we resist
I'm feeling evil like Knievel, we will kill so many people
There won't be nobody left to make a sequel
These fucking weasels always praying on a feeble
Kneel is lethal from the needle it's too late to make it peaceful
You always reap what you sow and now it's out of control
Dice are rolled and they all coming up seven
Always spreading the hate and now it's too fucking late
They met the plate, bring it on, this is Armageddon
They want to keep us all in chains
False sense of freedom while leeching on our veins
Always selling us a lie, but we've had enough
Time to die, motherfucker, die

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
I will rid the world of all the hatred
By hating harder than anyone did
They keep me from trying to have a great life
They're always having me pulling my [?] away

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
It's looking like the time is right
To grab an axe and hold it tight
And turn off each and every light
And murder what is shining bright
This is what I'm bringing to the party of destruction
I need no introduction
Let the fire burn inside the circle of pain
And we can all stand in the middle of me one to remain
And you can hold it in a riddle we can solve but all the same
I rather battle like a viking and put you all in the grave

[Verse 4: Jamie Madrox]
Earth rumblin'
They must have summoned a two headed dragon of destruction
To make a promise that'll punish them
With purge tactics open the closed caskets
Our enemies are evil motherfuckers die faster
Push 'em to the foot, and put em in line
They say that we're evil and they despise mine
My kind is killers that roll deep
Like ores from moonlight to sunshine
Destined to blow mine, say it for me one time
I want them all dead, I want them all dead
I want them all dead, I want them all dead
Want them all dead, want them all dead
Want them all dead. I want them all dead

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
I will rid the world of all the hatred
By hating harder than anyone did
They keep me from trying to have a great life
They're always having me pulling my [?] away
