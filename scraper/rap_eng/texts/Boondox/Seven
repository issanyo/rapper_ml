[Child's voice]
A tiskit a taskit
The scarecrows out his casket
Turn out the lights
And lock the doors
Prayin' that he passes

[Boondox]
A vision of the dead and the inbred of the backwoods
Muthafucka born inside a tool shed
Momma never love me
Never paid me no attention
Daddy was a rapist 30 years
Up state Fulton County Prison

And I was raised by my own will
Survivn offa scraps and bones
Bear traps and road kill
Spendin' my days and my nights all alone
And my mind is gone, there somethin' wrong with my dome

They shoulda put me in that tomb
I didn't ask for this life
When they cut me out the womb
With a dull pocket knife
Now I walk with a scythe
And a murderous ability

A corn-fed mothafucka filled with hostility
Cracked out and I'm gone off the moonshine
180 proof wine made from a muskadyin
Out in these corn fields learning all these
Wicked skills swingin' slicin' choppin' dicin'
Country boy born to kill

[hook 2x]
A demon spawn, child of a bastard son
Seven born at seven and the seventh child fathered one
A soul black full of pain
Bodies in the field blood pourin' like rain

[Boondox]
Don't get lost in the woods in
Your black Expedition
On a dark dirt road so suspicious
Just trees and ditches
Headlights flicker and it's
Got you turnin' switches
Now you so damn scared
Bout to shit in your britches
You can't think straight
All you hear is heavy breathin'

Are you eyes deceivin'
Wut it is that you seein'
When I pull up in the 84
Pistol in the floorboard
Blast out your back glass
Got you screamin' "Oh No"
You finna know the reason
And you bout to find out
What it is to suffer with
A rusted blade in your mouth
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Bein' stalked by the scarecrow
Blood line of Malakai

I hear there voices talkin'
They won't leave me alone
Tell me snatch this bitch up by hair
And drag her home
Over my shoulder in the back of a pickup truck
Can't wait to get home hold her
Bleed her then chop her up

[hook 2x]
A demon spawn the child of bastard son
Seven born at seven and the
Seventh child father one
A soul black full of pain
Bodies in the field blood pourin' like rain

[Boondox]
A tiskit a taskit
The scarecrows out his casket
Turn out the lights
And lock the doors
Prayin' that he passes

[Children's Voices 4x]
A tiskit a taskit
The scarecrows out his casket
Turn out the lights
And lock the doors
Prayin' that he passes
