[Intro:]
(Deep voice)
I can hear them screaming through the forest at night

Snakes (x20)

[Verse 1:]
In the belly of the beast a place that's miles away
In a deep Southern Town where the devil comes to pray
A choir sings with their eye's sewn shut
By a stream the children play in water flowin' with blood
The pastor stands on his pulpit while preachin' to hell
On a hilltop church with demons ringin' the bell
They toll twice for the missin' and the recently departed
In the pews the congregation sits a hundred days rotted
Suffering is all around the stench of death in the air
Nobody seems to notice or nobody seems to care
It's just an everyday life in a normal routine
People walkin' right by, but never notice the screams
A backwoods philosophy passed down through the ages
Generation of murder written down in these pages
Of a book, overlooked, and forgotten in history
A place with a secret and surrounded by mystery

[Hook:]
I can hear them screaming through the forest at night
They pray with snakes, and they've poisoned my mind
(x2)

[Verse 2:]
Was it a curse or a sickness that raged in the minds?
Of these sacrileges hillbillies raised with the swine?
No remorse in their souls in their hearts pitch black
Thirsty for the blood high on murder contact
Feastin' on the brains of the ones they call sinners
Cousin Cletus in the kitchen carvin' torsos for dinner
In a barn on a meat hook bodies are hangin'
In the cellar by a chain more bodies are swingin'
And in the fields like a scene from an old parkin' lot
Abandoned for so many years cars left to rot
And buried in the garden in a hole dug deep
All the bones and the belongings all piled in a heap
Ungodly sounds of torture echo through the trees
The screams and suffering still blowin' in the breeze
Not on any map, undiscovered, never surveyed
Secrets of a small town kept locked away

[Hook:]
I can hear them screaming through the forest at night
They pray with snakes, and they've poisoned my mind
(x2)

[Interlude Skit:]
Just about any warm afternoon
You can find the weathered looking white haired man
Wandering the hills searching for poisonous snakes
Not to kill, but to bring back with him for church
He is a serpent handler

[Hook:]
I can hear them screaming through the forest at night
They pray with snakes, and they've poisoned my mind

[Outro:]

They pray with snakes. (x8)

Snakes (x16)
