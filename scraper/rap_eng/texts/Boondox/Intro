Pitch black was a nite a black as could be
Pick it up went bam bam blim blim
Shut up....I said shut up!
The dead lay all around me We all together lay
You goan have ta keep that pretty little mouth quiet
Oh lord...Trouble done started
I said shut up bitch!

If you dont shut up Ill bleed you rite here
I will not forgive you! None of you will be forgiven!! All of you shall feel his wrath!!
Shut up!
The dead lay all around me We all together lay
All of you shall feel his wrath!!
Hush up
