[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
I took her to the carnvial and fed her cotton candy
She was as sweet as can be
Yet everytime we ride the scary ride
She would always sit the closest to me
Like an event of danger I would come and save her
I would be a hero right out of her dreams
But deep inside I'm just as nervous
As she probably is although it's not the way that it seems

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
Hold on to me
Goin' fast my palms are gettin' sweaty
I'm feelin' this terrible cold (hold on to me)
Calm down my heart is beatin' steady
I think I got it under control
You don't call me no more
You don't pick up the phone
I'm only 10 short seconds away
If the timin' is right
If it's day or it's night
Even if you don't have nothing to say

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
Silly was I to ever love that bitch
Cross me once and I'mma cut that witch
Brought it to my level, gave me love and shit
She never gave me any reason
That she wasn't worthy of it
I'm a pretty good judge of character
Had a couple mishaps in my past
That I wouldn't wanna relieve
Relax or relapse it's a 50% chance of happenin
Just like a heart attack (what a horror ride)
Goin' fast as hell we can't be discreet
She don't kiss or tell
She don't talk or speak, she don't say a word
She don't tell me that she love me
That would be absurd
Silly was she to never call me back
She didn't wanna seem desperate
Hell hath no fury like a lunatic was feelin ashamed
And embarrassed cause he knows when he's been rejected

[Verse 3: Boondox]
Smell of Pantene, nicotine in her clean blond hair
And I can't believe this chick said "yes"
Way up on my knees like a 10 speed in a street race
With the nipples that I'm feelin' on her chest
Try to steal a kiss but the bitch start trippin'
Now I'm gettin' pissed cause the bitch start lippin'
Screamin' "take me home" at the top of her lungs
At the car door I can't believe this bitch is dippin'
Pull up right beside her, rolled the window down
But my dick still hard from her rubbin' on the crown
But she can't hear a sound with the cars going by
With a hate in her eye started walkin' towards town
Pretty please pretty baby tell me how to make amends
I got the baby better ready for the glaze on your chin
It's so great for the twins and it's good for your skin
Bitch thanks for the date, please call me again
