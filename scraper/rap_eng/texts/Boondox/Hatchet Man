[Boodox:]
Either swinging off my neck on my chain that wicked blang
Or tatted on my skin when I represent this hatchet man I accomplish anything
I step up to the mic and them stage lights they hit it right
Transform me from the ordinary zero into pimp tight
With nothing in my way but a brighter day I'm making history
With a runnin man up in my plan my name won't be no mystery
Cause I got this shit on lock and you can put that on my hatchet
Just like death and f*cking taxes they gon' always be a psychopathic

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
My hatchet chain swinging in the wind like some old dudes nuts
Look at it wrong, you best be throwin them things up
My hatchet, I sharpen that boy like regularly (best believe)
Your throat will be whistling that's just how the f*ck it's gon' be
Unless you ain't a juggalo or throwing the hatchet up
You might catching up repping old school and new juggalos dub the f*ck
No fine print needed to see what the f*ck is going down
Yeah you, you hold your shit up, we need you just like y'all need us too
(hold them up!)

[Chorus: x2]
We hold em up round here
We hold em up (juggalos), we hold em up round here (yeah), we swing em side to side
We hold out hatchets high
We hold em up (juggalos), we hold em up round here (yeah), we swing em side to side

[The R.O.C.:]
It's the heavy sound a lot of blood, sweat, and tears see this homie get down
Hatchet man stands with los and lettes on it's chest
From all reaches of the planet, no damage to the way I rep
It's like the man had a plan for me as he stands with me
As I saw him on the side of me and as he ran with me
Goddam I'm a fan of he
And every other mutha f*cka repping when I see ready to bare the burden
Like Christ spot light departed in the dead of night
Slice through the misguided barricades with this hot knife
Please keeps with this hatchet right, not a fad
Cause when he comes round, get him pissed homie you better lay down
My spit I hope you like now, I represent the psychopathic sound

[Monoxide:]
What is means to me really don't matter to nobody but me
Really don't like where everybody can see
And everybody can even be everybody but me
Is it the power that we posses that will make a mutha f*cka hate us or less
We wanna act like every other person and shun the rest
That's why the best wear a hatchet man on the middle of they mutha f*ckin chest
Don't temp to ever test unless you wearin a vest I suggest and not a thing less
What I reps my set my heart don't question that or I'll wait in the dark
Waiting for you I'll let the hatchet man spark
Listen up and let the big dog bark
Hatchet in the air from the mutha f*ckin start
For that I'll put a big ass hole in your heart

[Chorus: x2]
We hold em up round here
We hold em up (juggalos), we hold em up round here (yeah), we swing em side to side
We hold out hatchets high
We hold em up (juggalos), we hold em up round here (yeah), we swing em side to side

[DJ Clay:]
This hatchet man swing everyday around my neck, right to left
Let it rep and watch me shine from my feet to me head
It ain't gotta be platinum or white gold as long as it's on my chest
I'll rock a plastic one but it gotta be the little that runs with the ax
And I wish somebody would try to take it from me
Leave the sidewalk bloody, get your mind right homie
And if you didn't know that there's a whole squad of us
Ganged up, mobbed out wearing hatchet man colors

[Violent J:]
If you could hold a hatchet in your hand and run a thousand mile an hour
You would turn into diamond and experience the power
Of belonging to this team, being strong with super gleam
Crawling up from out the dirt like hidden treasures never seen
Fists would fly never seeing eye to eye, some fools would fight me
Now I celebrate with under the moon with 50 thousand like me
And one day I'm a look back and what this hatchet man has done
Laying on my death bed I'll pass it on to my grandson

[Chorus: x2]
We hold em up round here
We hold em up (juggalos), we hold em up round here (yeah), we swing em side to side
We hold out hatchets high
We hold em up (juggalos), we hold em up round here (yeah), we swing em side to side

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
Throw your hatchets up high keep em up in the sky
Love for the fam ain't never gon' die
Representing that juggalo world for life
From the underground and O.J.'s wife
Rep this hatchet man you see I wear around my neck
It's proud affiliation to the people in my set
Homies that I respect been down since day one
One a mission for the planet side by side till it's all gone
We all got love for the one out dubbed by none
The hatchet man still shining brighter than the sun

[Madrox:]
I could tell you what it means cause it brings to life
All my dreams and my fantasies alike
I was just another face in the crowd
With intention to do what ever it took come up and get down
In the underground now my sounds got a meat cleaver
Hanging out the side of my flow and I'm labeled a juggalo
By the heads who know I'm a hero to some and a villain to other
But that's the way the game go never be the same so
My blood won't snake through the veins
Of the other mother f*ckers bumpin that will feel this pain
Now it's more than a charm and a chain
And the lyrics to the song that they learned to sing
Instead a heart every time it beats
Were labeled underneath the streets
And keep it hardcore like concrete
Every time you speak if you ain't down with the hatchet man
You flat out weak

[Chorus: x4]
We hold em up round here
We hold em up (juggalos), we hold em up round here (yeah), we swing em side to side
We hold out hatchets high
We hold em up (juggalos), we hold em up round here (yeah), we swing em side to
