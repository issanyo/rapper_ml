[Verse 1]
Early in the morning still half a fucking asleep
Half a fucking hard and pissing on a toilet seat
Another day for me to not give a shit
Feeling like cliche, just rage for the hypocrite
My girlfriend thinks that I'm a huge scumbag
Looking at me like I use her hair for a cum rag
But I ain't tripping 'cause she's making good case
'Cause everytime I pull out, I'm aiming for her face
My resumate ends in 2005
Around the same time that I last had a sex drive
I mean I still have sex but it ain't driven
A tampon chomping really satisfy a woman
Insecurities, lack of maturity
Every drug ingested mixed with impurity
Got me feeling that I've finally reached the ceiling
Doing something drastic is seeming more appealing

[Hook]
I'm lost and constantly grieving
The darkness is calling me, the voices are screaming
I'm fallin', I'm fallin' out of control
They're callin', they're calling, I can't consult
So I'm letting go

[Verse 2]
Put on the television but my cable's disconnected
Didn't pay the bill guess it should have been expected
Look at my phone but there ain't nobody texting
Check my social media to add to my depression
I'm a fucking joke, at least that's what I'm reading
They might just have a point, feels that's how they'll ever treat me
But I wonder what would happen if I fucking went assassin
Drag them all down for a little satisfaction
The twitter throat slitter, Facebook strangler
Instagram son of Sam, Snapchat mangler
Make them all bleed and post it on my timeline
Viral mental spiral cause I'm out of fucking my mind
A selfie with the victims for my profile pics
Every murder more sick to increase page clicks
A serial killer social media homicide
Committed by a lunatic who's more than qualified

[Hook]
I'm lost and constantly grieving
The darkness is calling me, the voices are screaming
I'm fallin', I'm fallin' out of control
They're callin', they're calling, I can't consult
So I'm letting go

[Outro]
"I've saved my best fun just for you!
Where are you David?
Come hit me!
I know you're under there, where are you?!"
