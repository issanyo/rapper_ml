Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window

[Verse 1]
I'm not afraid of the dark
But I'm afraid of my heart
And I'm afraid that everything is gonna fall apart
Always afraid that things will never get better
I went from writing down rhymes
To typing suicide letters
Diagnosed with paranoia
You can check my prescription
I'm a manic depressive
One of my many conditions
I'm not a prophet though I say it
But I'm seeing a vision
My life, it was beyond it
On a one-way collision
If ignorance is bliss
Then I'm devoid of any sorrows
Cause I don't wanna know the outcome
Of today or tomorrow
I just wanna hide inside my own private Hell
How can I ever get to Heaven
When so many angels fell
I'm just a human being
I'm just only being human
With eternity and judgement
From another always looming
It's a wonder that I made it
With these voices in my head
With all these monsters at my window
Staring at me in my bed

[Hook]
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window

[Verse 2]
If you're a friend to me or kin to me
An enemy or into me
I'm begging on a bended knee
Come and put an end to me
Put me out my misery
Permanently no injury
I'm tired of fighting entities
I'm running out of energy
Feel like a lost boy
Searching for the answers
Just waitin' on tragedy
A heart attack or even cancer
So many monsters hiding
Waiting round the corner for us
If life is like a song
I'm at the verse and searching for the chorus
Maybe I should stop and take a moment
Put it in perspective
Maybe I should take a knife
And take a life and get injected
I just wanna go out
On my own fucking terms
Knowing it was me that put me
In the dirt and with the worms
I think I'll pop another pill
Try to heal the ill
Wash it down with gasoline
Light a match and that's for real
But I'll just probably go to sleep
And try to clear my head
Hiding from these monsters
At my window  underneath my bed

Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window
