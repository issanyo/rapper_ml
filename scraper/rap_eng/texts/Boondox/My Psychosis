[Pre-Chorus: Ian Stone]
I don't wanna spit that stupid shit like you
I'd rather kill you all than do the things you do
So if you didn't notice, then you better know this
All I really know is that it's my psychosis

[Chorus](x4)
My psychosis
(La Da Da Da)

[Verse 1: Damien Quinn]
The leather face of Wisconsin, I bury corpses often
Or fuck em till they harden, then chop em right up
Yup I'm nuts, I'll eat their guts, these sluts are not safe
Razorblade cuts they face through my actions of hate
YES Imma rape em, YES Imma take em
Down to my cellar where I start to mutilate em
Bake em in my oven, man I love the smell of burning flesh
Just as much as I love the look in they eyes when they take their last breath
Death is beautiful, murder is an art
Cut a hole in they chest, exposing their heart
Body parts scattered, all over my house in piles
I'll take the razor blade, and give em a permanent smile
And slice they face open wide like mine
Then I'll drag the blade down their spine
As it pierces they back, my mind starts to snap
I can't help but laugh

[Pre-Chorus: Ian Stone]
I don't wanna spit that stupid shit like you
I'd rather kill you all than do the things you do
So if you didn't notice, then you better know this
All I really know is that it's my psychosis

[Chorus](x4)
My psychosis
(La Da Da Da)

[Verse 2: Ian Stone]
Yo, this town is so hopeless, you're under hypnosis
I'm back from the dead bitch, with a swarm of locusts
So focus, don't you act like my style isn't potent
Oh shit, puffing on a doobie when I wrote this
Notice, I can part the sea like I was Moses
Or rip you limb from limb and dump your body off in oceans
So if you wanna fuck with me, then I'll be posted
Where's my fuckin' money, bitch boy? That's my slogan
I'll drop you like I was Hogan, slice through you like a Shogun
No bisco for you hoes and catch you when you be dozing
Half you players be posing
Hoping we didn't notice, maybe it's my psychosis
Or is that bitch the grossest
Ho that you've ever seen
Why is she on your team
Fuck the whole horrorcore scene
Skanky ass drama queen
There's nothing left of me, but a simple melody
Really need some therapy
Wish I could fall asleep

[Pre-Chorus: Ian Stone]
I don't wanna spit that stupid shit like you
I'd rather kill you all than do the things you do
So if you didn't notice, then you better know this
All I really know is that it's my psychosis

[Chorus](x4)
My psychosis
(La Da Da Da)

[Verse 3: Boondox]
You are now about to witness sickness on another level
Sixes caught the century, blood and piss is mixed in by the Devil
Holy water suffering, this nightmare creeps into my dreams
Screams from burning corpses is the only that darkness brings
Olanzapine's I got em, Ziprasidone I got em
Antipsychotics in my veins, I think my brain is rotting
I hear the voices saying, they like the choice I'm making
Flush your prescriptions down the toilet, you don't need to take em
You ain't the one that's crazy, they've all just lost their way
Pick up the nearest sharpest object, make em all afraid
Nobody listens, pays attention, fuck it, kill em all
Chemical imbalances welcome to the murder ball
A padded cell in hell is where I spend eternity
Unless I purge the whole world then it's a certainty
No more time to think, it's time to get it done
But I gotta see my shrink, it's almost ten to one
