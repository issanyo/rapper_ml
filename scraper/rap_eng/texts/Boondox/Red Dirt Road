[Verse 1]
Pitch black red clay screams echo from the trees
Kudzu covers every living thing
And dead folks seen down by the side of a road
Voodoo chants to the echos and the squak of the crows
Yea, who knows just what you'll find on a midnight ride
If you stoppin' for a piss or if your battery dies
You'll wanna keep on movin', don't stop for a second
There's a thousand lost souls who fuckin' learned that lesson
(red dirt road)

[Bridge]
Somwhere past the old cemetery
There's a place where evil and death live (red dirt road)
The sun never shines and the devil walks by
This place ain't nothin' to mess with (red dirt road)

[Hook]
You'll die all alone where no one knows
So don't ride down that old red dirt road (red dirt road)

[Verse 2]
Blood chills and spills just like a liquid
And there's somethin' in the air that don't seem quite right
A red head dead bride floats by your ride
A staind dress that once was bright white
Baby breathe and steps on your window
While somethin' invisibles scream from a mossed shed
Decapitated spirit fade if you're near it
Then appears in your backseat lookin' for it's lost head

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Suicide sollution tha confussion
Many lost souls are restin' in pieces breezes
Blow through the trees they grab the trigger and squeeze
Then let their spirits join the other deceased it pleases
The demons screamin' needin' more of the same
The necronomicon is burned into this place like a flame
And it's callin' your name, the dirt road leads to hell's gates
Welcome into evil into death it's here, hell waits

[Bridge]

(Red dirt road) 2x
