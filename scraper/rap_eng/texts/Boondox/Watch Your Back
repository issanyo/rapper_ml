[Hook]
Look out, cause I'm on the prowl
Gonna find these motherfuckers
Gonna take them out (Huh!)
Before you know you find the hatchet attacks
And if you ain't one of us, watch your back

[Verse 1: Boondox]
Fire up the grill
It's time to sharpen up the steel
Hold your nose like the shit's
About to get real
I'm about to get a whole lotta
All kinda drastic
Execute your ego
Then throw it in the casket
I'm talkin to these freaks and geeks
Who speak my feat
Up in they beat
Your reap, retreat
And fall asleep
Would heed to lead
The fuckin' deed
That red dot pointed at you
Means that you've been chosen
I'm bout to pull the trigger
Pull it, leave you decomposin'
I'm giving you no sympathy
And I feel no empathy
When the evil enter me
From my chosen prophecy
And it was meant to be
That you was my enemy
And you see your destiny
And you ain't likin' what you see

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Boondox]
I'm outta control
And you out of a soul
And you act like a hoe
And you out in the cold
With no clothes n frozen
Looking like an Ice Pop
Burn your ass with gas
But I'm gonna wait until the price drop
Wait until the price drop
You're comin' up hashed
And I'm coming up behind you
With a baseball bat
And a baseball hat
And I'm swingin' for the fences
Taking your defenses
And I'm charging you expenses
Thinkin' you can hustle me
And not end up a casualty?
Fuckin' with the Scarecrow
Bitch, you're fucked with no Vaseline
Comin up short's like a joke
Youze a wishin
Got caught slippin'
Now your whole crew missin'

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Violent J]
The Buzz Saw, they call me the Buzz Saw
More homicidal than a maniac on drugs, ya'll
Spittin' slugs all day
Bodies in the hallway
Bodies outside
Bitches screamin
"It was all J!"
You come a long way
Listen to what my song say
Raised on a double dead-end
Two wrong-ways
I fuckin' showed up high
Ninja kicked you in the face
You got a blowed up eye
I'll be that clown-y mental case
That'll chase you, catch you
Stu Hart stretch you, let you
Recognize...
This wicked shit in my eyes
Watch your back
Or Imma have to crack it in half
Tear your fuckin' head off
Smack it and laugh
Violent J

[Hook X2]

[Verse 4: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Shaggy Shaggs
From rags to riches
Toe-taggin' scally-wag
Relative bitches
Watch your back
If you're comin' our way
I walk around big in tha Game
See Andre
Slice through your neck
Meat cleaver to butter
Dice your tongue off
Mail it to your Mudder
Cause we heard that shit
And turn the whip
Jumped out and plant a brick
Smack dead in your lip
From BoonDox
Watch your back bitch-boy
