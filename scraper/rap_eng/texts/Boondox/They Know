[Intro: Dj Clay]
SCARECROW

[Verse 1: Boondox]
On my knees havin' feelings of pain
On the ceiling blood sprayed mist
I'm needin some fuckin desperate healing
I close my eyes to see my whole life pass by
Im hurt up on the inside and ain't even gotta ask why
It's like I'm caught up in the pressure, feelin empty
Waking up drenched in sweat, soakin wet
Ain't got nobody with me
I'm all alone and fightin battles with my inner demons
Closet filled with bones  so many secrets and they're talkin to me
Did they see me do it? dump the body in the river
Open up their stomach, drink the blood, and then I eat the liver
Was there a witness to my sickness?
I swear paranoia got me goin crazy, should I confess?
All this murder piling up, stackin at my feet
Got me in them cold sweats I'm drowning in a Krimson Kreek
Now I'm nervous, feelin empty  scitzrophranic
All this passion, skull bashin, got me manic in a fuckin panic

[Hook]
I feel their eyes on me
Somethin watches my every move
If they see what I see, they'd know exactly what I do

[Verse 2: Boondox]
Try and amend yet another crime on my mind
Walk amongst society and try to leave this all behind
But every step I take I feel the pressure growin
People starin at me, shit, all these motherfuckers knowin what I do
By the moonlight while creepin in the dark
Do they know about the jogger in the bushes by the park?
Do they know about the lady in the woods by the highway?
Will I rot in prison cause I gotta do it my way?
I shoulda listened to em cause it all made sense
Burn the bodies, burn my clothes, and burn up all the evidence
But now I'm stressin with a mind full of questions
Scitzrophrania, depression, gotta find a new profession
Feelin weak with all this growin' thin and this agony I'm livin in
A killer from the crops only knowin bout a life of sin
This shit was easy when I didn't make the choices
Killin ain't the same when you're ignoring all the voices

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Boondox]
All these voices in my head, are they the voices from the dead?
I hear them comin down the halls underneath my fuckin bed
Is it their spirits or their bodies that I tried to hide?
They come to tell me that they gon be waitin on the other side
Or is it demons? yeah its demons knockin at my soul
I might be better off if I let em take control

[Hook]
