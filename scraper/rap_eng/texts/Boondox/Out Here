(Verse 1:)
Out here where the sun don't shine
We 'bout that hard corn liquor and that muscadine wine
Out here it's a fight even to survive
You a lucky motherfucker if you make it out alive
Out here all night wolves howl at the moon
Bodies' down floatin' up down by the lagoon
Out here you might get bitch-slapped by a black bear
And drug through the woods by your matted up hair
Out Here

(Chorus:)
(out here)
We have darker nights
(out here)
We like starting fights
(out here)
Know as the weed grows we risin' (2x)
(out here)
Clear roads and passage ways
(out here)
Swamp fields and massive graves
(out here)
Know as the weed grows we risin' (2x)

(Verse 2:)
Out here you might get your throat slit
By a crazy ass hillbilly drunk on a 5th
Out here you might wind up skin to the bone
Butt-naked in the dirt and you're miles from home
Out here don't go walking too deep in the sticks
Some folks got a strange way of gettin' they kicks
Out here they get crazy and dance by the fire
To a demon playing banjo along with Hell's choir
Out Here

(Chorus)

(Verse 3:)
Out here they cookin' 'possum and hog nuts
That's mountain oysters too all ya'll who dont know what's up
Out here they all about that country lifestyle
Shootin' shotguns, getting fucked up, and buck-wild
Out here even children drunk Coronas
That double barrel sure to send that ass into a coma
Out here country folks don't play
Chop your fucking head up and won't hesitate
Out Here

(Chorus)
Know as the weed grows we risin' (8x)
