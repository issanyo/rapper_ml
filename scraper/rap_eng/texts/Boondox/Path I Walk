[Intro]
We walk all alone
Always on our own
We walk all alone
Always on our own

[Verse 1]
I remember when life was a struggle
It ain't all roses now but back then it was double
I remember when
When I ain't have no pot
When you piss on the floor you stay pissed off a lot
I remember when I was searchin' for answers
In the house of a dealer in the arms of a dancer
I remember when I thought I was finished
You been down this road then give me a witness

[Hook]
We walk all alone
Always on our own
Get lost on the way
And sometimes need
To find the way home
But we walk all alone
X2

[Verse 2]
When you walk on your own and you ain't got crystal
The future you sees at the end of a pistol
Lookin for clues that end up in wrong places
So many troubles and so many faces
Got blood on my hands from some crooked decisions
Blood on my heart from some painful divisions
Askin myself if I would take it all back
No I wouldn't this is my path

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I remember when I left you there cryin'
You was down on the floor and looked like you was dyin'
I remember when I seen you out drinkin'
Surrounded by dudes it felt like I was sinkin'
I remember when I pulled the fo-five
The safety was on and so you still alive
I remember when I was in holding stressin'
But lucky as hell cause they ain't find no weapon

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
So now that I'm grown and I'm thinkin' 'bout shit
'Bout the life that I lived and the things I did
All the ones do I hurt
And the ones who where there
All the people that fucked my and made me aware
You got to be strong to stand on your own
You gon' to do some wright and you gon' do some wrong
But when it's all over just lay there and laugh
You're dyin' alone but you stayed on the path

[Hook]
