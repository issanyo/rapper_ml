[Intro]:
That's an offer to die if you ask me
So what if I'm fucked up in the brain
I didn't ask to be this way, that's just how it is

[Hook]:
I'm a little fucked up
That's the way they made me
And that's why they hate me
They can all just die if you ask me why
That's how I'm feeling lately
I don't need no reason to believe in anything
I'm out my mind
The paranoia voices telling me ima be alright

[Verse 1: The R.O.C.]:
Yea
I'm that ghost in the shell, I'm the ghost with the shell
Stay shark I kill like Chappelle, maybe not I
Send them all back to hell, them cats suck energy repel
Hit em with Patronus charms and veil
My lockbox starts no patterns, see
Murderous demand in my
Inner beast fathoms but I keep chains on my matters
Even though my brain paint splatters
I'm screamin dog just quit it
Get that 25 to L that bidness life time wait
That fitness bang bang is the best scene
My reign will never see screens
No blocker just blockades
As a renegade through your whole team
Yea I know I'm so low for life, no squad but a big knife
Pistol low a lil dough
All to lead a country on a long flight
Brain works just a lil different
Body parts I grind em up, serial kill all you mudbloods
Then walk through life with a nice cup of Ciroc so hope not
You see me I offer sips
But just know whats mixed up in my cup's a little fucked up shit yo

[Hook]:
I'm a little fucked up
That's the way they made me
And that's why they hate me
They can all just die if you ask me why
That's how I'm feeling lately
I don't need no reason to believe in anything
I'm out my mind
The paranoia voices telling me ima be alright

[Verse 2: Boondox]:
Some might call me a monster
Cause my thoughts are nefarious
This iniquitous sickness has got me livin vicarious
Through my lyrics like spirits all haunting me like insidious
All my music is hideous to these typical idiots
Who all sit on the sidelines and talk through the grapevines
Continue to take time they constantly hate mine
And wonder why my thinking ain't in line with the mainstream
And wonder why my heathens always stay on the same team
We all fucked up from perception to expiration
We'll cancel your respiration
Without any hesitation
Broken like the homes and bones from adolescence
Stole from trasidone and eatin antidepressants
I gotta confess it
I don't care if it's killing me
Confusion and chaos because I love instability
This is who I am with no apologies given
And death can come and take me now if it don't like the way I'm living

[Hook]:
I'm a little fucked up
That's the way they made me
And that's why they hate me
They can all just die if you ask me why
That's how I'm feeling lately
I don't need no reason to believe in anything
I'm out my mind
The paranoia voices telling me ima be alright

[Verse 3: Mr. Grey]:
Yo Yo
I'm fucked up like the mile high club
Like mama bear tearing you up when you fucking with a cub
Like too much alcohol or overdosing on your favorite drug
A lot not a little and I've finally had enough
This rocky road can be rough
Push me over the edge and get snuffed
No remorse seeking destroy you fucking numbnuts
Hell-bent the demon the devil sent i say kill em all
Gorilla goon got no repent

[Verse 4: ClockworC]:
Hatin or lovin it there's more to dialog on top of raw wylin flying wildin
Crashing smash my screws loose
Then my voodoo fuck your mind
Fuck your lies and vice grip my dreams
Homie believe to bedeep bedeep
That's all folks cause ganja left me
Shit got messy I'm Joe Pesci
They laughin I'm blastin a good fellow with passion
The hood tellin me mashin but I'm mashing the gas
It's a drop bomb my minds on I been firing shots
It's that AK play bang bang
Drink cyanide on the rocks
Got me slurrin this way in the campaign then
But baby nothing gonna stop the clock yea

[Hook]:
I'm a little fucked up
That's the way they made me
And that's why they hate me
They can all just die if you ask me why
That's how I'm feeling lately
I don't need no reason to believe in anything
I'm out my mind
The paranoia voices telling me ima be alright
