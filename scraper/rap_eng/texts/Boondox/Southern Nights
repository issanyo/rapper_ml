Southern nights are sippin on Henny
Southern nights are rolling up that good
Southern nights are hot sticky and muggy
Doublewide tucked in the woods

Southern nights are pitchforks and gravel
Southern nights are shooting cans of beer
Southern nights are chasing them donkies
Bitch why don't you and your girl get over here

The Southern moon exposes killers
The Southern moon is hot like fire
The Southern moon it knows our weakness
Trips you up like chicken wire

Southern nights are warm and sticky
Southern nights are swampy and loud
Southern nights are home to the Skarcrow
Posted up under the moon and proud

Won't you take me back to the dark so pitch black
Most can't see where we at it's where i'm happy

Southern nights are tipped back on SoCo
Southern nights are flippin off the PoPo
Southern nights are cruising in a big block
Foot to the floor quarter miles in a parking lot
Southern nights are hunting chickens with a spotlight
Southern nights are shooting up a stop sign
Southern nights are trolling in the pitch black
Out on the lake with a six pack laid back

The Southern air stings with mosquitoes
The Southern air intoxicating
The Southern air gets hard to breathe though
Shot gun blasts with crazies chasing

Won't you take me back to the dark so pitch black
Most can't see where we at it's where i'm happy
It's where I am one with this land I've become
Take me home take me back it's where I'm happy

Southern nights are going to the dope house
Southern nights are gotta take the short route
Southern nights are chasing that rabbit
Blows to the nose and you know you gotta have it
Southern nights are your bitch giving you skins
Southern nights are your finger in her best friend
Southern nights are getting head on a dirt road
If she ain't down she can walk her ass home

The Southern mud will tap your luck
The Southern mud will trap you shut
The Southern mud will snatch you up
Some say that's why it's red like blood

Southern nights are drunk in the Waffle House
Southern nights are fucked up so we wild and loud
Southern nights are sun up when we get up
Take your ass to sleep cause we gotta do it all again

Won't you take me back to the dark so pitch black
Most can't see where we at it's where i'm happy
It's where I am one with this land I've become
Take me home take me back it's where I'm happy

Knee deep in the swamps far from any others it's where i'm happy
Underneath the trees where the green roof covers it's where I'm happy
Where it gets so dark you don't know if you're still alive it's where I'm Happy
Please let me die under dark southern skies it's where I'm happy
