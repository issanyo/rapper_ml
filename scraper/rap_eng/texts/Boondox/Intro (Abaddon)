[Verse 1]
Lord invisible and omnipotent
Let us gather on this day in reverence
Of the 32nd name (Abaddon) amen
Asmodeus, personification of destruction
Tail of a serpent, mouth of fire and flame
Prince of lust and destroyer of temple be mighty among us
It is he who commands the 72 legions
He whom is irradiating whisper in the blanket of the universe
With but a pinprick of light shall his glory manifest
To blacken out the very sun
That radiates such a disgusting display
Invocation of Solomon, doomsayer of the kingdom
Oracle to the builder, the destructor of the pillars
Be mighty among us
By the golden seal may your presence be felt
May you be potent, may you drain the life of the universe
And manifest thy glory of darkness
Let it be known that if a man
Change but a letter or a word of this ministry
Then the wrath they shall suffer shall be so great
It will be truly incommunicable
With but a modicum of depravity
Can one see the work of the mighty hand of destruction?
Let it be known that if a man denieth the name of destruction
Then he himself will become the one who destroys
With but a modicum of hatred
Can one see the work of the mighty hand of destruction?
We evoke thee, we call thee, we summon thee
And by the word and sign, be mighty among us
