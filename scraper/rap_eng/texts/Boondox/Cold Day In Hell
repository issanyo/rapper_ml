[Chorus]
I sell my soul to the devil for a .45, a black cowboy hat, & a switchblade knife
I might burn like a sinner if they take my life, but it's a cold day in hell before they take my pride
I sell my soul to the devil for a .45, a black cowboy hat, & a switchblade knife
I'ma burn like a sinner when they take my life, but it's a cold day in hell before they take my pride

[Verse 1]
I sold my soul to the devil for this mic in my hand, but I ain't ever gonna sell out
A million dollars for my name to expand
Take ya fans & ya brands, & you can go an get the hell out
We really living in a fucked up time
So many fucked up minds inspire fucked up crimes
& they be quick to sell you out at the drop of a dime
Too many coward motha fuckas livin life with no spine
We in a bind

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
My belly ache from these fake little snakes who come & go as they please just to get what they need
They use are name just to get a little fame
Then it's out like a flame
I wanna make these fuckas bleed
Like some hooker on the street
Sellin pussy just to eat

Take the money & run
I wanna take out my heat
Pull up on em while they sleeping
Put em six feet deep disrespectin psychopathic put a tag on ya feet, go to sleep

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You think that I don't see
Ya better take it on down the road
Ya think that they don't see, but everybody fuckin knows, watch me unload

[Verse 3]
One thing I ain't is a self righteous saint
Too many sins been committed to ever get me acquitted
But it's a fact won't find a knife if ya back cause I put it all on this track, & to this shit I'm committed
& I won't ever leave ya hangin
Always keep that thang swangin like the fuckin dope man I'm always stay slangin
Drivebys on these fake perpetrators stay bangin
I'ma always stay the same while the while the world keeps changing

[Chorus]
