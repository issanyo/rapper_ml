She lies awake for days suffering in misery
No one to hold her close and give her what she really needs

Blood flows like a busted nose
Red fluid drains down and it stains your clothes
No rest no strength ain't been fed in days
Down in the cellar kept you locked away
My one true love and I said I adored you
Walks in the parks so I never ignored you
We held hands in the dark as the band played
Looked you in you eyes told you never to be afraid
I knew it wouldn't last but I wanted you forever
Had to find a way for us to stay together
That's when it happened and the thoughts came clear
A smile on my face as i whispered in your ear
Come walk with me, walk into the night
Sip champagne with me lay beside the candle light
I took her hand and the last word said
I made her mine forever with a blow to the head

She lies awake for days suffering in misery
No one to hold her close and give her what she really needs
I know I want to see here be with her all throught the night
And so I'm waiting for her last goodbye

It was a song walk her over my shoulder
Thinking about the moments and the things tat I told her
Throught the swamp through the fields
Past an old barn I never felt so alive my baby in my arms
I looked down at the ground I saw her blood drip
Had to get her back fast couldn't lose her on the trip
So many things that I needed us to do
I call it love others might call it taboo
But I don't give a fuck her happiness is all I need
Pleasure that she's looking for when I make her bleed
Down on her knees praying for the first injection
Loving is to suffer have her praying for the resurrection
At my doorstep sat her down let us in
Looked in her pretty face wiped the blood from her chin
Over the threshold i swept this girl right off her feet
The time is getting near for this fairytale to be complete

She lies awake for days suffering in misery
No one to hold her close or give her what she really needs
I know I want to see here be with her all throught the night
And so I'm waiting for her last goodbye

Down the stairs around the corner to her new home
Coming to her senses and she's knowing something's going up
Eyes glazed she looked at me as if to say
Tell me what you've done and please make this all go away
But no words no sound from her precious lips
She reached and touched me softly with her broken bloody fingertips
The tears fell and reality was sinking in
In utter shock and disbelief at this unforgiven sin
The smell of death like a reminder echoes through the walls
Knowing that she sits all alone down those darkened halls
I want to hold her touch her lay beside her never leave
But the sadness on her face will never let it ever be
And so she sits and stares just waiting for her final breath
A mix of love and broken heart wishing for her death
And on this night I sit here waiting for the end
When i can walk those darkened halls and be with her again

She lies awake for days in misery
No one to hold her close or give her what she really needs
I know I want to see here be with her all throught the night
And so I'm waiting for her last goodbye
