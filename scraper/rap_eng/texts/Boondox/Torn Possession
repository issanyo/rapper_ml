[Hook]
I can hear heaven calling but I can't find a way
I can feel myself falling but I can't find my way
Angels in my ear tellin me don't 'let go'
But demons in my ear tellin me to let go
Let them fight for my soul and they both want control

[Verse 1]
I'm surrounded by the dark become a stranger to the light
Put all my hopes into the fact that everything will be alright
But as I sit here crippled nervous in a state of shock
Times become my enemy I'm staring at a broken clock
And every hour on the hour some thing strange is taking place
Apparitions on the wall voices and my soul is raped
I can't explain it am I burnin' in that fire pit?
Has the devil come to claim what's his for all the times I needed shit?
I tried sleeping but still I could feel it creepin
Call off the deakon bloods leakin right from the ceiling
I hear the rain fallin tappin on my window sill
Shadows crawling babies crying make it all seem so surreal
And what's that tickin in my head
I know for sure that I ain't dead
If that's the case then why the fuck am I still sittin in my bed
I'm tryna scream but no sounds so I'm reachin for the phone
I need to call some one right now to tell me what's goin on

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Seven days and nights go by and I ain't seen the fuckin sun
Layin here surrounded by a preist som crosses and a nun
Speakin in a foreign language but I seem to understand
Crucifix is burnin flesh right when they placed it in my hand
Holy water feels like torture fallin on my head
Demons whisper in my ear don't worry son you're almost dead
Moms cryin daddies packin pictures flyin on the wall
I can hear my grandma talk in tounges some where down the hall
(backwards talk)
Next thing I noticed I'm wakin up I'm in an empty room
Some what unfamiliar was I sleepin in an empty tomb
And then a light from up above
I heard a voice filled with love
A lady dressed all in while I didn't who she was
And I can't explain the calm
After the shock pain in my arm
All I know is I feel warm and I don't care what's goin on

[Hook]
