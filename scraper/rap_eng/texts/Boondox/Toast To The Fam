(Verse 1)
Im tore up from the mothafukcin' floor up
Golden grain to the brain
Not really given no fuck
A sloppy truck bed
Huggin' ery' damn body
Half a fifth of jack
I'm bout' to get this bitch buck rowdy
A juggalo scarecrow with a big bong
Chuggin' southern comfort in my drawers
Playin' beer pong
Hit the bar for a couple shots of 3 V
Put ya bottle in the air and toast to the family

(Chorus) X2
Everybody c'mon we gon sing a song
I'll grab a bottle you grab a bong, we gon
Get lit til' the sun come up
And imma toast to the fam with a dixie cup (alright)

(Verse 2)
All i know is in this bitch
Lets get it on and poppin'
Y'all molest no regrets
Lets see them panties droppin'
And it don't matter if you smoke or if you drink
If you pour a little water, fire up a little dank
Roll a blunt light it up
And imma pour a glass
You get high and I get drunk
And then i meet yo' ass
Somewhere in the middle somewhere on the other side
From east coast to west everybody gettin' country fried

I'm drunk, you high, come on, we'll fly

Somewhere, down there, down south
And we won't have a damn care

(Chorus) X2
Everybody c'mon we gon sing a song
I'll grab a bottle you grab a bong, we gon
Get lit til' the sun come up
And imma toast to the fam with a dixie cup (alright)

(Verse 3)
I'm home so take me drunk again
You stoned i hope this shit don't ever end
Me shakin' mystery in a cup with somthin' tan gray
(where the fuk'd u put ma car?)
What'd the fuck you say?!
I don't know but this shit is got me all blown
My head is achin' like I'm smokin' on some home grown
I need another shot
And make that shit a fuckin' double
And pass my fam the blunt
I want them fuckers high as hubble
When juggalos up in this bitch
We drink and smoke all night
We gettin' tore down
And swing our fuckin' hatchets high

(Chorus) X2
Everybody c'mon we gon sing a song
I'll grab a bottle you grab a bong, we gon
Get lit til' the sun come up
And imma toast to the fam with a dixie cup (alright)
