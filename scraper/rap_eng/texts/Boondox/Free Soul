[Hook: Boondox & Jamie Madrox]
Let that country air on in
And roll the window down, let's ride my friend
(I got nothing but time that will roll down that windin' Georgia road)
In search of my free soul
Nowhere feel like home
When you grown comfortable to being all alone
(In a world we know, I'm uncapable of letting go)
In search of my free soul

[Verse 1]
I put this on the Bible, press it straight to vinyl
I primal spiral got me hoping for a final idle
Maybe Judah Michael, our gutter covenant
All I know for sure is you can’t trust the government
Whiskey in me seems to keep the demons busy
Always searching keep me living like gypsy
So many miles from Dixie and probably for the best
Constant confrontation kept me beating on my chest, I’m lost
But that won’t keep a man from playing
Like praying for an answer
Will not keep me from paying the cost
I'm putting tears in so many eyes
When he dies, refers to so many lives

[Interlude]
Life is full of too many questions and not enough answers
But sometimes it's the best to just let it all go
Roll the windows down and ride it out

[Verse 2]
This is my confession, another counter blessing
Another misconception hiding answers to my question
Another something for my nothing ass to aggravation
My father taught me, why don’t he fill out the application?
So many sins passed down from every generation
So many lost souls ‘cause he was feeling penetration
But I ain’t putting all the bullshit on him or me
From what they say it was a woman picking from the tree
… Of life, and now we all face the blame
We all play the game or we all face the flames, so why?
Do we even bother trying? Let’s pack up all the lying
Send it all back to Zion

[Verse 3]
Sometimes the only thing that I know
Is a long dirt road is the key to my soul
And I don’t know where the next life goes
But tonight I don’t care, I’m just letting it roll
It’s like I’m always steadily running and I’m sick of the race
My hand on the Bible, damn I’m sick of the chase
I just wanna set the whole wide world on fire
Light this motherfucker up and watch the world get higher
Watch the world retire all the lies and hypocrisy
Before the moment and ignore all the prophecy
If there’s another long road on the other side
Let it wait for me ‘till I’m done with the other ride
