Intoxication, filled with the medications
Sedation powder made from ??
Put me in this fuckin situation
My lungs are cold and feelin like they explodin
I'm loaded, wrote it all down
I'm givin you this invitation
To come and visit me, come into my mind
And sit a minute, join the spirits
To take the time to unwind and you'll find
The DNA ain't fallin far from the tree
Come from a long line of the murderous kind
So don't be fuckin with me
You wanna check the history
Just pull the newspaper clippin's
And find the trailer where it happened
I bet the blood is still drippin
And I'm sippin on Kerosene, and it's just to make me enabled
To let the world know that my family is more than unstable
And I might be the black sheep for the secrets that I'm tellin
More than half my bloodline is layin dead on a felon
And I ain't sellin no lies, my last name is a curse
I'm hopin that I survive yeah, just to finish this verse
I see the hearse

Kerosene, go get the matches
Light this thing and burn the branches
End the pain and suffering
Burn it up and kill my family tree

From way back, I remember my father's expression
When the telephone ring at 3am you didn't have to stop and question
Cause we knew that dark cloud was hangin just like a noose
The only thing on our mind was death and who did he choose
The time my cousin ate a bullet and my other cousin followed

When they sister heard the news, that's when the Drano got swallowed
Seen my first closed-casket just before I could talk
And I almost met the same fate just before I could walk
I lost my aunt to a pistol with her husband on the other end
Nine years old and already noticed a trend
So many friends dead and buried
Many coffins been carried
On a first name basis with too many cemeteries
And I'm weary of my fate, scared for the ??kids, and me??
Cursed like the Von Erichs, somethin like the ??Kennedy's??
Say a prayer for me, if you're down on a knee
And pray to God you ain't branches on my dyin family tree

Kerosene, go get the matches
Light this thing and burn the branches
End the pain and suffering
Burn it up and kill my family tree

Chop, chop, chop it down
When a dead tree fall, does it make a sound
Chop, chop, chop it down
When a dead tree fall, does it make a sound
Chop, chop, chop it down
When a dead tree fall, does it make a sound
Chop, chop, chop it down
When a dead tree fall, does it make a sound

Kerosene, go get the matches
Light this thing and burn the branches
End the pain and suffering
Burn it up and kill my family tree
