This is a cat (meow)
This is a horse (whinny)
A cow says (moo)

I hear them talking to me and the demons stalkin me
Running in between my thoughts and dreams I think they haunting me
Got me sweatin got me stressin wake up in the woods with a Smith and Wesson
Bucked naked countin blessins blood soaked clothes with no confessions
I don't know what it is that's livin in my nightmares
I don't know what it is that's bringin all these night scares
All i knowin is what the f**k I got to lose
When everything I'm dreamin of end up on the evenin news

Chorus:
Boondox:
I'm sleepin only sleepin I'm sleepin only sleepin
I don't wanna sleep I don't wanna dream I don't wanna hear the suffering, I don't wanna hear the screams
Violent J:
I'm only dreamin, I know I'm only dreamin
Boondox:
I don't wanna sleep I don't wanna dream I don't wanna hear the suffering, I don't wanna hear the screams

Last night i dreamt that i was standin by a streetlight
Bloody knuckles bloody nose but was i in a street fight?

That's when i woke up body feeling broke up
Eyes glazed in a haze f**ked up cuz i'm choked up
It's to a point that I don't even want to fall asleep
Every time I close my eyes another victim at my feet
It's getting hard to deal and hard to reckognize the real
Hard to keep my sanity and hard to say just how I feel

Chorus

And I don't want to know why this chick is barely breathing
Begging for her very life scratching clawing kicking screaming
While I just stand there laughing while this bitch's life is passing
Rope around her throat I watch her choke for every breath she gaspin
I watch her face and watch the tears pourin like rain
How'd I end up in this place translated in her fears and pain
So sick my stomach churnin in slow motion while theworld keeps turnin
So sick mind of a vermin knowing that my soul is burning

I dont wanna sleep i can't even close my eyes
I don't wanna dream every night somebody dies
I don't wanna think what's the truth behind these lies?
I don't wanna hear the screams and i don't wanna hear the cries

Chorus
