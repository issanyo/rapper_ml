[Chorus]
Love me tender, love me true
Guess what she's goin do to you
Flesh & steel she'll take your life
All because the love of my life is a knife
Love me tender, love me sweet
Cuts right down to the white meat
Flesh and steel she'll take your life
All because the love of my life is a knife

The only thing up on my mind is how to get this bitch undressed
She like a new toy straight up out the wrapper
Thinkin bout the situation got the butterflies
Im laughin like a hyena and no she ain't shy neither
Everybody that she see will be dyin when they meet her
With a long lean body baby built to perfection
Love lookin at her cause I'm seein my reflection
Bringin out the best of me always sittin next to me
Just thinkin about her in my hands its almost as close as sex to me
She keeps my heart beatin like a high school drum
I can't wait till I get home from work so we can spend some time
She's lying there when I'm pullin back the cover
And its just only me & her but this can't work without another
So its gonna be a late night my bitch is on a mission
Lookin for the next victim about to make this proposition

[Chorus]
Started off the night up at the tops & tails
Bitch be sittin off the deck & so we hoppin rails
Cause my babygirl hot we gotta keep that low profile
And what we bout to do could be considered sick & so vile
Make a straight line up to the VIP
A stripper lady named Mercedes & my girl & me
She started dancin for the money lookin so divine
And when my honey touched her skin it sent a shiver up her spine
Lookin at me kinda crazy soundin slightly bold
Askin why the fuck my touch be so hard & cold
So I'm lookin at her back but didn't open my mouth
Because I knew that it was time to turn this fuckin whore out
Now I'm starin at her titties feelin something like a sinner
Almost didn't even know thats when my bitch just slid up in her
And now its something like a threesome and I'm suckin on her breasts
While my baby got her cummin cause she's fuckin her to death
My girl the best

[Chorus]
[Skit]
