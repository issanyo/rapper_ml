She was new in town
She was a treasure that I found
She liked to swim at night
And she was angel like

Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you?

When she swam under the moonlight

Who the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?
Who the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?

She was angel like

Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you?

When she swam under the moonlight

Who the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?
Who the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?

She grew popular
There was no stop'n her
She started losing sight
And she forgot about

Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you?

Me and her in the river at night

Who the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?
Who the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?

The girl forgot about

Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you?

Me and her in the river at night

Who the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?
Who the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?

She was merciless
Her love was posioness
I had to take her life
And now she's angel like

Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you?

Float'n dead under the moonlight

Who the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?
Who the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?

She's so angel like

Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you?

Her skin all pale and white

Who the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?
Who the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?

The girl is angel like

Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you?

Me and her in the river at night

Who the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?
Who the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?

And everything is alright
And everything is alright
And everything is alright
