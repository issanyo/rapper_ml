Psypher two. What it do? Nigga this Psychopathic shit. Bitch
Now you can fake it like a actress
Living on a mattress
Lying like a motherfuckin' bitch cause you a Baptist
Rollin' in the Honda should've called you Rhonda
Rappin' about your bitches you with niggas in the sauna
Dippin' in your sandals grippin' on they handles
Chewin' on you nigga you be sweeter than some candles
I'm being like I can be
Haters they can't stand me
I tell them bitches they fake then they represent the family
You stinkin like you Stanley swearing you was manly
But now you just some niggas in they mouth like they some candy
If you ain't Psychopathic you can get your ass kicked
Found like a bloody pad bleeding in the basket

[Monoxide]
I like to murder a bunch call them groupies
Record it all my home movies
Afraid of Paul you barely knew me
Better make the call
This motherfucker's coming back for all of y'all
Like a chainsaw buzzin' all wide eyed lookin' like an 8ball junky
Got the rest in the ride if the cops feel lucky
Enough ammo to take out a small country
Head of the dragon
Ricky Steamboat when I used to love me a little channel 50 wrestling
Stop hassling buddy
But it's nothin' get ya nutty and put a couple holes up in your Caddi
There ain't nobody that can do it the way that we've been doin' it
Like a temple you're losin' it to the crew with the underground influence
And it's proven to movin' units
And there's nothin' more you can do it to it
Than just to prove of it

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Jump in the booth grab the mic and I spit
Your psypher on that ass my shit's ridiculous
My middle name is William some hoes call me Willy
Now really don't be silly but it's one place that I really be
Psychopathic holdin' up my hatchet
Perpetrators try but they fail to try to match it
Fallin' short you like a midget with no legs
Reaching for the stars fall then bullshit instead
I guarantee your daddy is hatin' my guts
Put my penis in your sister down to my nuts
And if she wouldn't now she a Juggalette
Just the sound of my voice gets her neden wet
The realm of the wickedness that's where my fans stay
We keep it that way forever and a day
I kill your career just by bustin' one verse
So what you a star I'm a motherfuckin' universe-verse-verse
Yeah. Who next? Bring it

[Boondox]
It's like this run up put my foot in your ass
With this country motherfucker you ain't catchin' no pass
I just blast and ask questions later
And empty both barrels in your Navigator
And call your girl up and tell her see you later
And make that pussy steam up like a baked potata
With hustle in my heart and murder in my blood
My first name dirty and my last name mud
I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
Raised up in the woods but I'm still fuckin' hood
I put the microphone in a rear-naked choke
If you bet against this monster and your ass i'll leave broke
I might step up in the booth and put an end to your world
I might climb up in the sheets and put it deep in your girl
Cause I'm ruthless and it's the only way I do this
Southern Psychopathic up on psypher number two bitch

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I leave suck ass bitches with stitches face down in ditches
Stop running this and recognize it's strictly business
You can't change past up you can't test fate
And still I ride and die with the people that you hate
They only Jim Joyce safe and I'm caviar to play
With the Louisville slugger and I'm quick to smash a face
I relate to the serial killers gangsters and zombies
Diggin' up some dead bodies to make an army
Blasts that spray all over like a 12 gauge
Known to combust into dust then vanish into space
Take shots at close range I'm impervious to pain
Stay dirty unchanged and I still won't feign
With my finger on the trigger then I squeeze that shit
Can't afford a blunt I put the light to it
Check the 40 ounce I said my name's on that bitch
He said his name on that bitch I said my name on that bitch

[Outro - Shaggy 2 Dope]
Psycho-mutherfuckin-pathic in this bitch! Psypher 2 motherfuckers! Don't try to fuck with it. See what you can do. [?]
