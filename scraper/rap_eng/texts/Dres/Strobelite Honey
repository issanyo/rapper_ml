[Verse 1]
I skipped the line, I paid my dime
I hung my coat, and now it's time
To move to the forefront make my rounds
Say peace and give a pound have a drink, get down
I'm on the floor, besides the door
The sound is rich, and I ain't poor
I'm looking for Susie or Wendy or Judy
But look at her (but look at her)
But look at her
(Who me?)
Yes, you sweetie, although it's hard to see thee
I see your silhouette and what I see has got me needy
I need you for a second of your time
But then I reckon that a second is too short let me try
(You're slamming!)
But anyway, I'd like to say
I'm Dres of the Black Sheep givin' you play
Step out in the light, come show off yourself
Yo, I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else

[Chorus]
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
Just don't know "Why?" Hon, I just don't know
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
See something ain't right "Why?" It's the strobe light

[Interlude]
[Mista Lawnge]
Van Damme, Oh man, now you look out
I can not dig it, I can not dig it
No, Black yo, I can not dig it

[Dres, Strobelite Ho]
Listen Hon, I mean aaaaaah
It was nice looking at you, I just have to go
My man is right over there
(Where you going?)
I have to go my - Huh?
I'm on my way Black, I'm on my -
(Don't you have a number or something?)
Listen it's uh, seven six five, four three two one
(Wh-what area code is that?)
One, nine-hundred

[Verse 2]
Listen here dear, step to the rear
Find yourself a seat, buy yourself a beer
Eat some pretzels, go play some videos
Thank you for your time honey but ho I gotta go
I think I lost my coat, and plus I'm double parked
I thought you was my girl, you see I can't see in the dark
Anyway I'm out, out is what I be
I've got to step
(With the viscosity)
When you see a honey by the strobe light
Black I hope you got good sight
For honey that you see, like a Shakespeare soliloquy
May or may not be, all that
In fact, quite wack
With the girl that makes you stop tracks
But neither here nor there fear
Unless, of course, you don't care
Listen baby girl, let me say it slow
I-have-to-go
Not to dis, but let's disperse
Yo, I'll see you later, unless I see you first

[Chorus]
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
Just don't know "Why?" Hon, I just don't know
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
See something ain't right "Why?" It's the strobe light

[Outro]
Can't swing tonight, so ahhhhhhh
Honey take a hike, go fly a kite
And I don't mean to be um impolite
But yo, I'm outta here aight?
