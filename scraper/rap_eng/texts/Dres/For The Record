I guess it was school
That introduced me to the thought of selling candy
Puffin' joints with my mom, sipping on blackberry brandy
Through a bloodshot tint, see the world's a hue of blue
Going through a lifetime, to learn what I already knew

Reevaluating cool, since I'm the one that gives it
Ever struggle at what you speak, I'm the one that lives it
Keep the clip in your possession if you pass me the gun
Cause being broke at 40'd probably give a nigga the runs

And what's worse than every dollar to your name in my pocket
Would be scrollin down the list to find my name on the docket
As the truth still has me yearning
In a world of fiends and vermins
As I feel you'd freely piss on me if I were ever burning

Did I mention my intention of a global intervention?
As what people did for money now what they do for attention
As the malice in my heart is way too much for one tongue
'Til I'd happily keep company of all that's unsung

Be more dangerous and still, I got a black man's soul
It's in the max of my appeal, I play a black man's role
Many shapes, sizes and colors be the blend of my squad
To attain the unattainable forever try hard

And I forever fail God
Less and less of being sure
Rappers don't make sense
They like the word 'holy war', oxymoron I guess
'Til the sheep's old and gray
With fam, while your fans oscillate and blow away

Too many people are program directors
They only play us for the record (x3)
Radio to video, tell me who protects us
They only play us for the record (x3)

Not a fairy tale where dragons take your little girl away
Walking through the fire feeling this in maybe everyday [-??]
In a world, where many won't find me fighting for the same
Pick of any, I got many, even more reason to pray

'Til the sun is shining brightly, why I feel so cold
Looking out a foggy window, why I feel so old
Practice tend to compound, with the circus in town
You ain't troublin' me, keep in company of a pound [-??]

Why do we live in [??] foolery, dictate policy
Not that a weekend slave, could never be as hot as me
Probably, not to be inspiration of correction
A bisection [??] not to follow children, without direction

Your turn if you don't like the place people took it
Stupid; not only do they act it but they look it
Fake fraudulent ones that make a brother wonder
'bout those that hit the lotto actin' like they hit the numbers

So it's dead now, but in my shoes, even more damned
Resurrecting my life as though God kissed my forehead
I likely don't like me, but if it's just me
At my show, I'll appreciate the music, tip the waitress and go

Although I dabble in it all I don't hustle my floss
It be a man's idea, but the time that's yours
So I challenge the boss, as the boss slows the reason ??
I'm forever lovely while they, forever for-season

Too many people are program directors
They only play us for the record (x3)
Radio to video, tell me who protects us
They only play us for the record (x3)
