[Intro]
Yeah, from all of mines to all of yours. For one cause. To all deceased

[Scratches]
"Good die young"
"The good die young son, the good die young"
"Down goes another nigga"
"Good die young"
"Good die young son, the good die young"

[Verse One]
Oh come and take a walk with me
See through my world
The world where your peoples who's your peoples who's your peoples really ain't your peoples
I see mad evil through his eye set
And I bet
If I step wrong I try death
Who's the smooth cool, holdin' mac type of fella?
Hell if I know
Where are you going?
Yo I check ya later
I'm about to be connect with my spliff
Take a whiff
When it hit you in your brain, I'm gonna take a trip
Across town, just a small town, where we all down
Yo, I think I feel protected when I stomp ground
Sounds like something, this way comes
I smell it in the air but all's fair cause my mental's numb
See, I never planned to stay in this world forever
But, just come and make a little bit of loot and step
Anything else is just a small thing
Whatever the ball brings
I'm gonna haul it out at my funeral they all sing
Holla
Pass the dolla
The same bowl of sorrow cause I'ma be alright
See, I'ma be alright
See, I'ma be alright
The city ain't pretty, some say the shitty pity's good
Naw
Cause I can die right now and go to Heaven
Cause that's what the storybooks keep tellin' me
But I can walk with a nick in my hand hold a gun
Tell 'em why son
Cause the good die young

[Chorus] [x2]
Why the good die young?
"The good die young son, the good die young"
"Down goes another nigga"
Why the good die young?
"Good die young"
"Good die young son, the good die young"
"Down goes another nigga"

[Verse Two]
I sit in my room and I think till my nosebleed
These niggas don't know me
Ain't nothin' they can show me
No proof, no evidence
Murder in my presence
Bodies back to the essence
Break it down to dust
Infected up like puss
Struggle for my mental
Muscle, tussle's obsolete
Course on the concrete
My ? man's contagious
Put my pain on pages
As I grow up
Life will make me throw up
Regurgitate
And meditate (on)
Things that I hate
But I still maintain with my brain behind bars
Took off a little ? so rest in peace Martha Stars
And Bernie didn't deserve that
But I heard that
People's on an exposition
Murder type intuition
I only do for my brothers
The hell with others
And now split my forty ounce, let the beer pour
Put my jibbs to the door
He's my motherfuckin' heart
Word to your sons
Rest in peace J
The good die young

[Chorus]

[Scratching]
"It's always the good one's that have to die" -RZA 'Tearz'

[Verse Three]
Oh I get a rush like a lush with Alize for his people
Medieval evil keeps adrenaline pumped when I see you
And I don't have a care in the world
As long as there's pookie, pimpin' plus mad blunts to twirl
The good die young
That's bullshit, ? no one knows when I'm goin'
But you can best believe when I do
Elation and celebration plus blunts for the crew
So rest in peace
? Jackson, we maxin' in a ? and now he's missin' in action
I thought when it happened my brain would defer
Code three
Section one, you live and you learn
So please
Pass on easy star, easy pa
Around the way alley make the doe when your name gone
So when I die bury me face down in the grass
So this whole world can kiss my ass

[Bridge] [x4]
They always told me that the good die young
I never run and pack my gun and if they want it then it's on son

[Chorus]
