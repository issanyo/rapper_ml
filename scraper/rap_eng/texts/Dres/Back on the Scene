[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
Slaughterhouse family, ridin’ like a taxi
And yeah, I’m like Dres, I am like the Black Sheep
I just want a gangsta bitch, R.I.P. Apache
You sound dry, your legs look a lil ashy
You thought what you said was classy
But Slaughterhouse been about bread since Freddie Blassie
Freddie this ain't saying nasty
I’m a rap assassin that's sittin in the Aston
Thats cleaner then the demeanor on Eddie Haskell
Call me the defensive back on the track spit
And the slaughterhouse pigskin and you couldn’t put it past me
We done been through a whole lot in the past
'Cause niggas bash us for bein’ spazzes
Let it be known we’ve never known for bein' average
We prime like the Corleone re-enactment!
When it comes to talent, we the Jacksons
Eat a track we assassins
We mean, we back on the scene

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
You spend twenties on flowers, me? I put dubs on a Rolls
That's why I'm in the club with your hoes
What you lookin' hard for?
Don’t spill escargot on yourself and get slugs on your clothes
We the ones with the flows
Who hit em wit’ the dope lines?
The answer's right under your nose
Whenever hip-hop's falling off the track
We pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
'Til we back on the scene, crispy and clean
Fix me some whiskey and lean
Bitch we the kings
Only time your music is fly is when I
Use your compact disc as a frisbee to fling
I'm a cold young nigga
This your ho? Come, get her
Cause I'm so done wit her
And her whole tongue glitter
With the old cum spitter
Hit her then slide home, home run hitter

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Yaowa
It's a wrap for your team
When I get in that ring I put rap in the feign-ing
I don’t know what's happening-ing
Either I’m getting better or y'all falling off like the sag in my jeans
Relaxin’ I’m clean, immaculate lean
And goin' my two steps, something fat in between
Haters don’t get mad at my dream
Opposites attract
I’m nice and this track is just mean
So I’mma fuck it up, flow Avril Lavigne
Olive button up, Bo Jacksons and green
Fresh fitted cap on the bean
Sorta like a spine on a movie screen
Back on the scene
Back under the lights like a gat with the beam
Back at the register with the plastic machine
Back wearing my gold like Magic, Kareem
Back in them rap magazines
Click!

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Check it
Them rumors you heard about me I refute those
The attributes of hoes don’t affect my attitude at all
Die from what you told
Blood on your new clothes
Cause even the biggest fall, Manute Bol
What they want, two Glocks with ‘em
Be in the box wit’ em
Tryna box wit’ em while they got the ox wit em
Doctor Oz wit em, whole life’s a rehearsal
Cars got the horse power of that Old Spice commercial
Silence when the Vets speakin
I'm jet skiing wit lesbians
You just seein’, wanna just be him
In the casino, spendin' petti-cash
No worries I’m the same as what you met me as
Bitches sayin’ go ahead wit’ your sexy ass
Y’all can have my heart, you can get it out this plexiglass
Here’s a message to the haters
I’ll take money, power and fear, the respect’ll come later
