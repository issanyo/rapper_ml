[Mr Lawnge]
Yo! The Black Sheep has arisen here, oh dear
The cat's out the bag and it's the end of your career
Don't spit it out, let it persevere
I like to see my dick snot disappear
I got inch out the edge, Lawnge Don can't compare
So, ho, come here!
Now some say they get live but the Sugar Dick is live-er
In and out of any situation like MacGuyver
If it's not Boopie's then it's Lady Godiva's
When it comes to hitting ass I'm a striver
I'll use my dick to fight a war so there won't be no survivor
Call me the Nine Point Fiver!
Cause I'm the sugar dick, the Sugar Dick Daddy Mr Lawnge
Of the Black Sheep here to point out what's wrong
With emcees like these popping that bullshit, please!?
Hang it up, black
If it's a God-given talent then take that shit back
Analyse the style, go home and re-write
I know you wanna be down, I know you wanna be like
ME! The Sugar Dick Daddy Lawnge
If you think that you can play me, nah, you're dead wrong
Cause I write lines and wreck minds
Being that I'm the DJ I can flip at any time
I'll diss you on the rhyme, diss you on the cut
Have you on the dick so much there's no room for my nuts
Forget rapping, you nerds are herbs
Just get a job and ride my dick to work
Respect the Lawnge one cause fly shit I mail out
Yo, you got the wrong one if you think I'll sell out
Used to have a ho and I'm damn glad we fell out
I would keep on rapping but it's time to break the hell out

[Dres]
Yo bust it, I be a fly nigga as far as niggas go
I be a choice brother but only a brother would know
Chilling Eskimo as the general rule
If you can't say Dres, you can call me cool
Styles unlimited, you can't get with it
But you can get this if you straddled and it fitted
I wondered and I pondered if your family were Roman
Cause you're snuggly and you're cuddly, play me closely like a Trojan
Ah-ah, it busted, aww shit, don't act dumb
You opened your mouth, black, so yo here I come
It's a catastrophic state but let it begin
If my dick's on your minds then my balls are on your chin
Now here it's kind rough, so kids stay on your toes
If my balls or on your chin then pubic hair is up your nose
If pubic hair is up your nose then I suppose
I'm the nigga that gets and you're the nigga that blows
My style is immeasurable so put away your ruler
Think of the coolest kid you know, Dres is cooler
Smoother, slicker, quicker roll-flicker
Honey came bloody so I hit her in the shitter
Went to a first stone caster cum a master blaster
Tell you cause I know, black, get off the slim faster
I know you wanna emcee and be down with the rest
But stay on the head now cause that's what you do best
Your duck down sound compound no interest
Get down with the flock, motherfucker, invest
In the rhyming you're designing, I can see your shit climbing
To the bottom from the mid where it hid, bad timing?
What do you wanna know, I still gotta go
You're a tic out of tac but I'm busy getting doe
Move over just a bit for the sight taking flight
Still eager as the Beaver and I'm leading with my right
I'll coin one more then step, daggonit
Our dicks are the planet and where are you?
