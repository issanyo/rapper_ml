Looking sleek, I went to check the little one - all's well
Put up the tools and clips,; did a few pulls and dips; needin a
Shower
Smack my baby-girl on the hip. I'm on the move kid, I'll
Catch you bout seven; shit, showered and strapped and now I got
My
Engine revin'. Supereior handling - still got money left from
Gambling with these kids that I met through these southern joints be
Scramblin'. Turbo-boost, driving at exorbitant speeds; I
Proceed to roll a phil cause I can drive with my knees. The way I
Lay it
Down, please, bring new meaning to squeeze - Let my mind
Coast from ki's to dungarees to Gee's Loose ones and tons of fiends
On
The Hip-Hop scene, but what was once a guillotines'
Semi-auto sub machine - I dream elaborate - though it's gettin
Badder it
Doesn't matter yet......livin life as we imagined it

HEY, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE WORLD TODAY /
BROTHERS BE BUSTIN BROTHERS FOR
LESS THAN TIME OF DAY
FOR PAY / I'D LIKE TO CHANGE THE WAY THE
CHILDREN PLAY AND TEACH THE
WORLD A BETTER WAY

Said I was coolin, puffin La; I heard a knock at the door, and when
I
Opened, yo, you couldn't guess what I saw - It was the body
Of this kid in my life I never seen, on the ground, shorty didn't even
Look 16. Must've took it to go cause I ain't even hear the
Sound - Pulled him in from the hall with wifey holdin me down - He
Looked dead at a glance, then his eyes did a dance, and he
Spoke to me while my lady called the ambulance - Told me "Listen
To the
Words when a wise man speaks, many men search the
World and never find what they seek" - On the verge of tears
Looking at
What's left of his chest....My girl came, wiped his head
While I had a towel pressed on his torso - moreso than not he's
Gonna
Die, but I'm tellin him he'll be okay, I gotta lie - It's this
Thing called life so many times we take for granted - I hit the La
Search deep, and try my best to understand it HOOK The final
Minutes, seconds penetrate my days like a knife....To us all the
Promise
Death, I bring the promise of life - In my mind I see the
Time as my eyes see the truth - I see the setting of the sun inside the
Eyes of the youth.....As I travel God's creation hoping still
To see the sight that give meaning to the splendor of a sunrises light -

I disappear in the night to be absorbed in the black - to
Stack up all of the facts, so when I countereact - a full pack - fully
Auto, razor like a laser bear - silent but deadly the theme - you
Might envy the team, for the wealth, loving God is only good for
Your
Health - as for mine - hope to say in time the same for
Yourself - you're nice - I be just as....too live to debate - I rock the
Rugged rhymes that bust ass.....keep food on my plate Just a
Quarter of the calliber a brother contains and I'm not playing a game
-
One Love, and one aim HOOK
