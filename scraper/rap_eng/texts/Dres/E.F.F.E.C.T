[ INTRO: Dres ]
Yeah
A-ha
What?

Yo, check this out
This is how it's done
How you do it?
You can't blow the spot, we already blew it
(Show & A.G.)
And Black Sheep

[ VERSE 1: A.G. ]
I drop facts over tracks that go ratatatat
Fuck the red, white & blue, I'm with the black-black-black
You diss the brother Show, it makes me wonder
You put him to the test and watch the brother molest the SP-1200
Used to rhyme on calls and acapella
Now I'm doin shows forever, but I was always a 'goodfella'
You feel the wrath of the seven and a half
In that ass if you don't pass the microphone quick fast
Brothers been tryin to diss for years
As long as I'm respected by my peers
And get cheers - who the fuck cares?
Yeah, I'm weeded, but I'm undefeated
Niggas is heated because I'm makin a buck, yup, I succeeded
And ain't no time for no ego-trippin
Me and my homies are all for one, one for all, so let's see who's flippin
And I'm still with the brother Show
Whoever said that we broke up, they get the dick, and you can tell it's so
Showbiz & A.G. and Black Sheep
We're in (e.f.f.e.c.t.)

[ Hook ]
You know how it goes (You know how we do it)
You can't blow the spot (cause we already blew it)
You know how we do it (You know how it goes)
It's me or my brother (or me and my bros)
You know how it goes (You know how we do it)
You know how it sounds (when a nigga gets into it)
You know how we do it (You know how it goes)
It's me and my brothers (with the fabulous flows)

[ VERSE 2: Mista Lawnge ]
Now who can it be, you wanna see who's flowin next
]From the Boogie Down B-r-o-n-x
With that nigga D, Showbiz & A.G
My crew is mad deep, don't ever try to sleep or try to play me
You'll never be comp and your head will get stomped in
]From fuckin with the crew that's Boogie Down Bronx rompin
Yo, the Sugar Dick is the man, and
Even The Gap Band made a song about how I'm 'outstandin'
My favorite pasttime is breakin thee
Bitch-ass niggas that apparently mistakin me
For a nigga that's b-u-t-t
But they all end up r.i.p
So nigga, pause, slow down, baby
Back the fuck up, nigga, you must be crazy
The others tried to tell you, but you didn't heed the warning
Now you're gettin fucked up from late night to early morning
You wanna be, but you can't see me
Cause I'm in e.f.f.e.c.t

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 3: Dres ]
"Black Sheep, Black Sheep, where have you been, where?
Black Sheep, everything you do is cashmere"
Yeah, I travel upward, cause I come from Down South
Just when you try to counter, my hook's in your mouth
Baah! You can't stop me, I do what I wanna
I know you wanna, so yo, come on, I
Got skills for dills, give chills to mills
My style of wild is makin piles of dollar bills
So 'fleeex', and it's time to crack necks
Punks fuck around and get a chest full or Gore-Tex
You don't know me - from silicone titties
I keep shit on lock, Aki got keys in cities
I rock it, my style's your money in my pocket
You jock it and play yourself like Pee Wee when you knock it
Off the wall like a hanger, I drop my slang, a
Nigga never figured to be in your shit like a booty banger
Jingle-jigga, nigga, pass the Endo
Cause you fuckin with mees like you stickiin your dick out the window
