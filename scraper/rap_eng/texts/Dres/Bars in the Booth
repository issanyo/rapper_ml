This is Dres
D.R.E.S
Mister You Can Get With This
Black Sheep
It's Bars In The Booth with my dude, DJ Premier
I be the next contestant
As we body the beat
And kill comparisons
We're going to take it back to basics

But you choose it
Liver than most
Don't confuse it with amusement
You're not even close
But you gotta add your 2 cents
Double your gross
Trouble your coast
Contrary to popular
This is how you suppose
But you choose it
Liver than most
Don't confuse it with amusement
You're not even close
But you gotta add your 2 cents
Double your gross
Trouble your coast
Contrary to popular

Yo
Just a glimpse or a glance
In a trance with a trillion heads
Enhanced beats by Preme
With a rhyme by Dres
I spit it greater
The frequent flyer defecator
Tae-bo bozos and tie bows on the equator
A non-relator
I take apart a perpetrator
I love a hater
I hug him now and hurt him later
Like my rhyme came with a dance
And skinny jeannie pants
I ain't got none of that
But if y'all down to take a chance
I be Dres the quiet storm
I stand out in the swarm
And yo, no matter where I am
You know I'm far from the norm
I came to get gone
Get it on and form Tron
I been here, no illusions
The conclusion's far gone
When a king has no bows
You peep the fallacy
And if they're great big stars
I'm a tiny galaxy
Built great, I bloom late
And draw blood like a rose
Put me next to what they do
I'll be starkly juxtaposed
With this rocket in my pocket
Watch me take it out and cock it
Tell me how you're going to stop it
Pussy, I'm the opposite
Rockin it is why you know me
By myself but never lonely hold me
Horses couldn't hold me
With the blicky, shinobi
Locking it on every level
Hello my mello, you're jello
Medal for having no mental masterpieces
See me revel
So sheen, dope fiend
Dreams conceived in Queens
Borough, thorough my flow, nitro glycerine
Glisten and lifting them
I'm rugged by requiem
Unlikely you know somebody like me
Homie, think again
Shrinking them, got them sinking in phlegm
On the break
Think pink, cut the cancer
Saying "poor Tink Tink"
Don't get nosey, it gets noisy
If you're wack, you should avoid me
And my niggas came to fuck you for real
Yo, it's an orgy
Eating Porgy and Bess
I've got finesse like Finesse
It's the molotov D-R-E-S

But you choose it
Liver than most
Don't confuse it with amusement
You're not even close
But you gotta add your 2 cents
Double your gross
Trouble your coast
Contrary to popular
This is how you suppose
But you choose it
Liver than most
Don't confuse it with amusement
You're not even close
But you gotta add your 2 cents
Double your gross
Trouble your coast
Contrary to popular
This is how you suppose
But you choose it
