Do you not love me?
Because I’m short?
Do you not like me?
Because I’m not handsome?

Nobody lo oo oo oves me
Nobody lo oo oo oves me
I need a love, give me a love
Right now, right now

I heard of it till I got sick of it, I’m not good-looking
They said I’m ugly and short, I’ll never meet girls
Whenever I open my mouth, girls start cracking up
But why is it that my friend gets all your attention instead of me?

You know (Hey) I like you a lot (I like you)
Can’t we be (Why) Am I not good enough?
You don’t know what kind of person I am
You know I need love

Do you not love me?
Because I’m short?
Do you not like me?
Because I’m not handsome?

Nobody lo oo oo oves me
Nobody lo oo oo oves me
I need a love, give me a love
Right now, right now

Stop saying all guys are the same
You just haven’t met a good person
I could be good to you, hold my hand
My face may look like this but it has character, hold up

Don’t go (no) I’m not a bad person
I’m sorry (I’m sorry) that I’m not enough
You don’t know what kind of person I am
You know I need love

Do you not love me?
Because I’m short?
Do you not like me?
Because I’m not handsome?

Nobody lo oo oo oves me
Nobody lo oo oo oves me
I need a love, give me a love
Right now, right now

My reflection in the mirror is so pitiful
Everyone falls in love but it’s not so easy

Oh baby tell me why
The look you’re giving me makes me so small
I’m not good-looking and I’ve got nothing
How is a guy like me supposed to live?

Somebody somebody
Somebody anybody love me
Somebody somebody
Somebody anybody

Nobody lo oo oo oves me
Nobody lo oo oo oves me
I need a love, give me a love
Right now, right now

Somebody somebody
Somebody anybody love me
Somebody somebody
Somebody anybody love me
