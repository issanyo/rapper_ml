[Intro:]
You know what I’m saying
That’s how we get the attention
That’s how we grab the attention
Oh, he must be different
Yeah, the f*ck we different, we pimps
You know what I’m saying, ya’ll human

[Verse 1: RJ]
Money over matter but it’s morals over how you feel
Bubbling off the block break a piece and buy me out the deal
Look I’ve been exposed to too much
So I don’t condoning all that fluke shit true shit
If you can’t be used then you useless
OMMIO that’s a million dollar movement
Front a chick and piggy back off her Jouvay
Ah boy, me and your girl be cooling
Rotate the stroke told her share it with her room-mate
Damn right I can take a chick and stretch it out
Like hoes whipping everything left over thats the blow
I used to be quiet, closed mouths dont get fed
And closed legs never spread
Oh that friendship is stogy
You use your discretion
Excuse my aggression but sometimes I just question your motive
While I stretch out this quota
With a mass me my quota
For the rest of my section to notice

[Chorus: RJ]
No excuses
You can’t get a dollar out of here
You broke, useless (useless)
No excuses
You can’t get a dollar out of here
You broke, useless (useless)

[Verse 2: Joe Moses]
JM, huh?
I used to have a bitch named Topanga
That resides in Topanga, what
Said that Bobby Brown get it all on my fingers
Catch a nigga hanging out the sunroof loaded
Tell him play my shit and watch the young hoes quote it
Boy from the fifties with that project allah
CL coupe look red like bad eyes
Pulling up fresh  ball man like tada
Laughing to the bank like haha
I’m still that nigga that’s pulling up
Four deep and four guns
Four young niggas that dont give a f*ck on blood
Four bitches with four dates
And they better bring it all back
Break it four ways
I make em get off they ass crack
Pass last year for a foreigner shit
They’re like where you get it
Off touring and shit
Send a bitch on a trip like I’m warmer than them
Miool dollar nigga I don’t know about them huh

[Chorus: RJ]
No excuses
You can’t get a dollar out of here
You broke, useless (useless)
No excuses
You can’t get a dollar out of here
You broke, useless (useless)


[Verse 3: Choice]
Dressed for the cops, TV on the Glock
In a residential drop
Broke bitch I can’t stop
You spoke and you flop like a fish on land
The hoes chase the choice like a bishop hands
I’m getting rich but still don’t you push it past me
I’ll steal from your granny and blame it on your family (daddy)
I’ll drive it Ma, I won’t let you miss the Melo
Man I still didn't trust her had my little cousin cello
Friends too petty
This shit is looking silly
Instead of making a dollar with you
They gonna spend your pennies
These hoes too friendly, I know your business
And I ain’t got no business knowing
These girl scout cookies this is Samoa
Hold up, boots is worn in lace
Torn states out of place catch fades
Like do Mar and Jordan face
Woo, watch gorgeous face
Spent fifty on a timer you think
I got more to waste bitch

[Chorus: RJ]
No excuses
You can’t get a dollar out of here
You broke, useless (useless)
No excuses
You can’t get a dollar out of here
You broke, useless (useless)
