[Hook]
No way out
You gotta wait it out
Niggas was sleeping on me
But they better know it now
I told them I'm going up
You know when it's going down
And I threw away the key
And tell them there's no way out

[Verse 1]
I'm walking in the bank I need a big amount
Fuck what you niggas think
There's nothing to figure out
I'm sipping that dirty drank
But I need to cut it out
Lot of friends turn to dead weight
So you know a nigga had to cut them out, so I cut them out
I can never tell my momma a lie, even though I did a hundred of times
Told me that she can now follow her dreams
So that's what I'm gunning for ma
Not rich but I'm finna be, so I keep six of my enemies
Then I pour a fifth of the Hennessy, and go *bop bop* on they memory

[Hook]
Yeah 'cause there's no way out, you gotta wait it out
Niggas was sleeping on me, but they better know it now
I told them I'm going up, you know when it's going down
And I threw away the key, and tell them there's no way out
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way, no way out
I'm not with the run around, there's nowhere to run around
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way, no way out
I'm not with the run around, there's nowhere to run around, yeah

[Verse 2]
Links on my plate, lobster with the steak, I can show you how to flip that
Home invader with a couple agents and they only going where the rich at
Niggas coming to their senses, now swinging for the fences
Fuck a favor and a friendship, I need pensions and a pendant (Cuzzi relax)If niggas don't give me a shot, I'm taking a rock and taking their spot
Eye on the prize no waiting it out
When nobody making it out
Not rich but I'm finna be, so I keep six of my enemies
Then I pour a fifth of the Hennessy, and go *bop bop* on they memory

[Hook]
'Cause there's no way out, you gotta wait it out
Niggas was sleeping on me, but they better know it now
I told them I'm going up, you know when it's going down
And I threw away the key, and tell them there's no way out
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way, no way out
I'm not with the run around, there's nowhere to run around
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way, no way out
I'm not with the run around, there's nowhere to run around
