[Intro]
"...the youngest you can remember yourself rapping?" "I started rapping when I was 8. Nah, I just liked to rap, I didn't wanna go play hide and go seek or none of that. So I wanted to rap. I knew it was cool. Girls liked it. You know, I liked it. And obviously it wasn't the wrong idea

[Hook]
Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne
Diamonds on my neck goin' bling bling
Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne
Diamonds on my neck goin' bling bling
Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne
Diamonds on my neck goin' bling bling
Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne
Diamonds on my neck goin' bling bling

[Verse 1]
Steppin' out the mothafuckin' car, they in awe
Hoes takin' off their bras, lookin' like they seen a god
Where the real niggas at? All I see is frauds
I'm a mothafuckin' boss, I ain't ever had a job
I throw it up like there's a flag on the play
Bandana 'round my neck like Wayne back in the day
Leave the gun on the dresser and the cash in the safe
Seem to me like New Jack with the mask on the face
I fuck her for an hour, throw her in the shower
Never been to my city, let her ride my CN Tower
Before I kick her out, shit I give the bitch flowers
Fuck love, mama, I just want the money and the power

[Refrain]
And my chain, Toucan Sam that
Tropical colors, you can't match that, gotta be abstract
You catch my girl's legs open, better smash that
Don't be surprised if she ask where the cash at
Cuzzi

[Hook]
Lil Wayne, Weezy, Lil Wayne, Weezy
Diamonds on my neck goin' bling bling
Lil Wayne, Weezy, Lil Wayne, Weezy
Diamonds on my neck goin' bling bling
Lil Wayne, Weezy, Lil Wayne, Weezy
Diamonds on my neck goin' bling bling
Lil Wayne, Weezy, Lil Wayne, Weezy
Diamonds on my neck goin' bling bling

[Verse 2]
Yeah, murda 101, the hottest nigga under the Sun
I've been killin' y'all careers and I do it for fun
If a nigga want war, go and tell him to come
But y'all keyboard killers, only usin' your thumbs
I left the crib and told my bitch that I'd be back in a second
If the cops come knockin' gon' grab you a weapon
Fake niggas go play, they learn that at 11
Only baddies in my presence, gotta match the aesthetic
30 bitches in my crib and I'm conductin' a train
Let 'em hit the stripper pole and I be makin' it rain
All these hoes say they love me, but they say it in vain
I'm a Masi, you a Civic, nigga, stay in your lane, look

[Refrain]
And my chain, Toucan Sam that
Tropical colors, you can't match that, gotta be abstract
You catch my girl's legs open, better smash that
Don't be surprised if she ask where the cash at
Cuzzi

[Hook]
Lil Wayne, Weezy, Lil Wayne, Weezy
Diamonds on my neck goin' bling bling
Lil Wayne, Weezy, Lil Wayne, Weezy
Diamonds on my neck goin' bling bling
Lil Wayne, Weezy, Lil Wayne, Weezy
Diamonds on my neck goin' bling bling
Lil Wayne, Weezy, Lil Wayne, Weezy
Diamonds on my neck goin' bling bling
Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne
Diamonds on my neck goin' bling bling
Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne
Diamonds on my neck goin' bling bling
Lil Wayne, Weezy, Lil Wayne, Weezy
Diamonds on my neck goin' bling bling
Lil Wayne, Weezy, Lil Wayne, Weezy
Diamonds on my neck goin' bling bling

[Outro]
Lantz, is that you?
