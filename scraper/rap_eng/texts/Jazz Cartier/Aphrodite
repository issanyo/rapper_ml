[verse 1]
I love the water
And I wanna swim with you
Let’s smoke a bowl
And take a hike
Niggas never call me
Like they never call jhené
But why not
Both of us are baes
I’m just tryna do more than just be Boo’d up
I’m Tryna find my soul mate
What’s you’re zodiac
And do you get baked every day

[pre-Chorus]
In my room
Tap tap tap
Tapping tip to getting limp
Boop boop boop
Smoking and singing
Hook hook hook
Were like Poseidon & Apollo

[Chorus]
Let’s go swim naked
And smoke a bowl in the woods
I know a boy like me
Can have you shook
But don’t be scared
You can be safe with a guy like me
We like to do this thing
When you add 20 than
You + 3
This relationship is
Water + love + plants

[rap verse 1]
Trippie Redd tryna be
But I’m more of a creator
Call me Tyler
Expect I like to smoke like snoop
I don’t wanna be smoked like 2-pac
I’m tryna meet Lil Kim
The queen b
She got the mob so deep
I’m just tryna be a chief
That smokes some keef
I’m tryna fuck little Reese
After that my leg finna jetlag
Hey Matt OX
It’s time to fuck this fag

[rap verse 2]
Pack a bowl
With the whole bag
Suck my balls
That sag
I’d be more prettier if I was in drag
But I got a Rainbow Marijuana USA Stars Flag
And this pipe
I’m finna drig drag so right
And after 4 minutes and 20 seconds I’m gonna be so high

[Chorus]
Let’s go swim naked
And smoke a bowl in the woods
I know a boy like me
Can have you shook
But don’t be scared
You can be safe with a guy like me
We like to do this thing
When you add 20 than
You + 3
This relationship is
Water + love + plants

[bridge]
I’m writing this on
Gg#4
I know after this imma snore
My butt off
Yeah
Hit a nigga with a trigga
Touch his dick and see if it gets bigger
Cut a nigga open and sell his liver
I’m an og what’s it to ya
Let’s smoke a j in the winter

[Chorus]
Let’s go swim naked
And smoke a bowl in the woods
I know a boy like me
Can have you shook
But don’t be scared
You can be safe with a guy like me
We like to do this thing
When you add 20 than
You + 3
This relationship is
Water + love + plants
