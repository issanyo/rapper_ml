[Intro]
Yeah
This shit gon' change for the better
Shit gon' change for the better

[Verse 1]
I've been searching for balance, in need of a challenge
I used to sleep in a dungeon, I used to sleep in The Palace
Used to sleep in The Palace, I'm the reason for madness
I'm a vulnerable being I'm too concerned with my status
I used to live up in Houston, still got niggas in Dallas
My first impression was horrid, pardon the voices I panicked
Take a look at what happened, look at all of the damage
I may suffer from malice but please don't call me a savage
I said I'd write you a song, instead I wrote you a ballad
You said you'd paint me a picture but you burnt holes in the canvas
I remember the threats, I remember the talk
I remember the hoes, I remember it all
Niggas brought in figures when I had my back on the wall
Now-a-days they acting like it ain't ever happened at all
I'm with Lantz every night, man that nigga's a beast
See La Fleur ain't shit unless he on a beat
I came back to the city 'gain I sleep at Ronnie's
Had to stay on his couch but nigga I couldn't sleep
First recorded in Scarborough then ended in Markham
With all of the talking at Tona's apartment
We walked to the station, got on the subway
Then hopped in a cab just to mob at the Thompson
Man those were the days
Looking back at the pictures I'm feeling the change
Toshy was good had no scratch on his face
(Quince) in school, he was beasting them grades
But y'all remember when Toshy got bottled at Cobra
Then I got arrested for sleeping at Tona's
I met up with (Derek) and (Quincy) at Ace
Saw the look on they face and they said I'll be straight
Man they said I'll be straight
Funny how shit changed
Wait
See I was searching for balance, disregarded my talent
I had some showers in April, in May we moved in The Palace
Begging bitches to come, in the kitchen, no speakers
Our first party was what, Becka, Tisha and Meesha
But then your boy started poppin', send a text girls be flockin'
Afterparty at our crib, man the neighbours were knocking
We made your summer the best, don't forget, don't forget us
At The Palace 202, 202, where you met us
And then I met Drew in June, made him join the platoon
Niggas thought he was trouble, he had some screws missing loose
Boy he partied, he partied, started losing the shit
But that's my guy 'til I'm gone, it hurt me most when we split
But shit done changed in a year (Yeah)
I've been quiet of it all but you know I had to make it all clear
Yeah
But just know I'm wishing you well
I'm wishing you well
With all the success in the world, and all of the help
Cause you 'gon need some help
Just know that I'll see you in hell
Hate on Jacuzzi for now, but he'll see you in hell
You gon' need the help, see you in hell
So searching for balance, in need of a challenge
Thank you for coming, but this is the end of this album

[Bridge 1]
She said you can't be afraid, the world is your stage
Don't lose your trumpet baby, just play it your way
You can't be afraid, the world is your stage
Don't lose your trumpet baby, just play it your way
Play it your way

[Closing]
Don't count me out but just leave me out of your bullshit (x 4)

[Bridge 2]
I'm wishing you well, I'm wishing you well
For all of my haters, I'll see you in hell
Wishing you well, I'm wishing you well
You gon' need the help, hate on Jacuzzi I'll see you in hell
