[Intro]
Fleurever, Fleurever
"The next Station is Spadina, Spadina Station"

[Verse]
Yeah, man on a mission, hand on the wheel, steerin' my vision
Keepin' my distance, head in the clouds, mindin' my business
I got family that got homies who are locked down by the system
And I'm prayin' for the black girls who went missin' and missed Christmas
Now listen, what would you rather? Doin' it best or doin' it different?
I got sick of the dream, spoke it into existence
Started out with a dollar, finna turn that to a million
Black angel, been through hell and back, now they made me the villain
Oh, what a wonderful feeling
I learned a lot about my early 20s, lookin' back, a nigga wasn't ready
When it came to friends, I had way too many, a lot flaked when the shit got heavy
And a lot of times, I was more focused on dollar signs
I had to put it in overdrive, caught myself caught in so many lies
Argued instead of apologized, I wasn't ready to compromise
Many mistakes were ill-advised, had to cut it out, started cuttin' ties
I must've fucked up a hundred times, blamin' the liquor to justify
Everything that wasn't going right in my broken life
That's Fleurever

[Outro]
"Arriving at Spadina, Spadina Station"
Was it worth it?
