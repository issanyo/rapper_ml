Count on me

[Verse]
Too white for the black chicks
Or maybe y'all scared of the ones I attracted
Back in school they would laugh at my accent
8th grade in Kuwait, my first crush was on Camille Jackson
And at times I was a quiet dude, quick to make a silent move
Girl I know you heard the name, tell me what you tryna prove
Slave to the media, damn I think it's kinda true
Cause I was tryna seal the deal with every single Heidi Klum
I'm never at a party if they don't connect speakers
And I ain't the type of gentleman that won't respect divas
I was goin' through some things, and lookin' for some change
Shit happened 'round the time my nigga Tona met Misha
And now I'm lookin' for my afrocentric
But recently the ones I've met are rather apprehensive
I may have rubbed 'em the wrong way to grab attention
Then I came across Candice and I learned my lesson
Pardon me, but can I make a better first impression?
See we would talk, but by the end I'm runnin' out of questions
For a moment I was smitten, maybe for a second
The kind of face that you would see on top of every Essence, ten
And now I'm thinkin' of a city, or maybe just a beach
I think she's Lisa Turtle, cause girl I feel like Screech
Okay I love the way you dress, love the way you speak
Love the way you are, cause girl you're so at peace
And now the weather's gettin' warmer, but damn, baby you killin' 'em
Goin' out at nights, but damn, where goes the innocence?
I wanna take my time, and learn you like an instrument
I'm tryna get you hot, burn you like a cigarette
She said, "How you tryna fall in love and go back to the States?
You plan on breakin' my heart? Put it back in it's place
And watch the girls that you askin' to date
Shit, we all know that you have what it takes"
And now we're waitin' for the magic
Aladdin, tryna find my Jasmine, Candice
