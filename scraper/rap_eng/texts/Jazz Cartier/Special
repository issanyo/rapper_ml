[Intro: Tory Lanez]
All my guys, I just came with
Bunch of girls on me, it look like I just came in
All my guys, I just came with
Bunch of girls on me, it look like I just came in

[Chorus: Lex Aura]
Girl they look up to you, yeah
Girl they look up to you, yeah yeah
Maybe 'cause you're worth something
And these hoes ain't worth nothing
They look up to you, yeah
These bitches look up to you, yeah
Shawty I think you're special
'Cause you been on my mental

[Verse 1: Lex Aura]
That's why I fuck with you mama
Why you cut me off, I was stuck on you mama
You make me wanna change my ways
Don't you talk down on my name
You better hold it down for me
Fuckin' all day, yeah you had them rounds for me
I was in the hood, saw you out of bounds on me
Had to get my shit together 'cause
Girl you so special to me
Girl you got own one on me
I don't do this usually
Girl you do something to me
Every time I'm not around
I need you to hold it down
Shawty you makin' me proud
So glad you're the one I found, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Lex Aura]
Girl they look up to you, yeah
Girl they look up to you, yeah yeah
Maybe 'cause you're worth something
And these hoes ain't worth nothing
They look up to you, yeah
These bitches look up to you, yeah
Shawty I think you're special
'Cause you been on my mental

[Verse 2: Rexx Life Raj]
Look, you been on my mental, you know my credentials
Playing hard to get, you keep it suspenseful
But I like the chase, make me work for it
That's the type of shit that make it worth more
Long nights on the town to fill a void
Feeling too grown, you're sick of dealing with boys
I get it, ain't nothing better than grown women
The no handout, get it on they own women, uh
Cellphone buzzing, you don't pick it up
We all need a little space and a little love
When you have alone time tell me who you thinking of
Tell me what you thinkin' 'bout
Ventilate, air it out, yeah
You're way beyond the usual
So before you second guess, think you should know

[Chorus: Lex Aura]
Girl they look up to you, yeah
Girl they look up to you, yeah yeah
Maybe 'cause you're worth something
And these hoes ain't worth nothing
They look up to you, yeah
These bitches look up to you, yeah
Shawty I think you're special
'Cause you been on my mental

[Verse 3: Jazz Cartier]
Okay I'm sorry if I kept you waiting
I had to silence all the drama and them allegations
This could've been avoided with a conversation
You see me puttin' on a show for these hoes
Don't be dumb, you know my occupation
If I fuck 'em that don't mean that I love 'em
They wanna follow up on Insta but don't follow instructions
You couldn't wait for me to drop the ball
You see me out, start poppin' off
All your friends talking when they not involved
Fifteen for the Rollie but the budgets on skates
The main reason why I won't date
Pussy and respect, two things I won't chase
If you coming out wait, see this bond won't break
That's why I couldn't get enough of you
And that's the reason why I stuck with you
Way back when I used to take the bus with you
Girl you know I got love for you, stop playin'

[Chorus: Lex Aura]
Girl they look up to you, yeah
Girl they look up to you, yeah yeah
Maybe 'cause you're worth something
And these hoes ain't worth nothing
They look up to you, yeah
These bitches look up to you, yeah
Shawty I think you're special
'Cause you been on my mental

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
All my guys, I just came with
Bunch of girls on me, it look like I just came in
All my guys, I just came with
Bunch of girls on me, it look like I just came in
