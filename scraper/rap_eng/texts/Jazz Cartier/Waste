[Hook]
Why you niggas movin' waste?
Waste, waste, waste, waste, waste
I'm never out of line and I'm never out of place
Place, place, place, place, place
But everywhere I go I see you niggas movin' waste
Waste, waste, waste, waste, waste
You see me gettin' money now you niggas feel the way
Way, way, way, way, way
But everywhere I go I see you niggas movin' waste

[Verse 1]
If there's a problem come and say it to my face
Never in the gym, a skinny nigga movin' weight
Ran out of syrup, all the fiends call me Ace
Now you know a nigga pay
Head was amazin' so I had to call her Grace
She fell in love with me, I said "no I need my space"
I'm lappin' every nigga, every nigga in the race
Woah, I had to catch my pace
Lantz turned it up, you know I got to feel the base
I'm always in the kitchen servin' niggas with the plates
Nowadays I see you niggas movin' waste
I got a question

[Hook]
Why you niggas movin' waste?
Waste, waste, waste, waste, waste
I'm never out of line and I'm never out of place
Place, place, place, place, place
But everywhere I go I see you niggas movin' waste
Waste, waste, waste, waste, waste
You see me gettin' money now you niggas feel the way
Way, way, way, way, way
But everywhere I go I see you niggas movin' waste

[Verse 2]
T your nigga mama but they love me in the states
Cash cow Jacuzzi, man I had to raise the stakes
I need matchin' Rollies, they're for me and all my mates
And my girl's done with Tiffany, it's only Cartier
My chain's playin' hockey and I dangle on the skates
It's me and all my niggas and they down to catch a case
I ain't pickin' up my line, I ain't dealin' with no fakes
And every time I drive by I'm inflatin' all my rates
If you ask me how I'm doin' I'ma say I'm doin' great
She blowin' out my candle while I'm dickin' out her cake
I ain't dealin' with no fix
I got a question nigga

[Hook]
Why you niggas movin' waste?
Waste, waste, waste, waste, waste
I'm never out of line and I'm never out of place
Place, place, place, place, place
But everywhere I go I see you niggas movin' waste
Waste, waste, waste, waste, waste
You see me gettin' money now you niggas feel the way
Way, way, way, way, way
But everywhere I go I see you niggas movin' waste
