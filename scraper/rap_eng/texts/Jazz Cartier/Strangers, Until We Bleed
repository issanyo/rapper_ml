[Verse 1]
Hello?
You the one I write songs for, show's over
May I get an encore? If not, I guess not needed
They sing you can't love til your heart starts bleeding
May I get my worries in? It's likely to create a diversion
I live my life on a rug, no Persian
I'm innocent, I'm these diligent virgins
Meet me in the end zone, fuck love, bein' with me in that friendzone
Say somethin' when your friend's gone
I heard you loved my last song, I heard my hook is your ringtone
Why dwell when you can't weed? Why dream when you can't sleep?
Why talk if you can't speak? Go and learn something new
They say you can't grab what you can't reach, baby

[Sample]

[Verse 2]
Don't be a stranger, baby
You're my Tupanga, baby
I'm skating often ice like I play for the Rangers, baby
Hah, but that's not what's wrong, not tryna make another heartless song
I miss the days when my heart was strong
How could I love when my heart is gone?

[Sample]

[Verse 3]
I'm damn near cryin' now, you got me dying now
See I was on the ground but you, you got me flying now
Hah, and I need you, babe
All I really wanna do is feel you, babe
I know you're hurt but I'll heal you, babe
Pain's me to know that you feel this way
Huh, I can't get over the fact
You over the fact that we over and that
But friends keep saying that I'm over-attached
But I don't wanna say that over a rap, but
You got a friend in me and all you see's resent in me
Hopefully you're depending me and along the road remember me, cuz

[Sample + Jazz Cartier]
Don't be a stranger, baby
Cuz I ain't changing, baby
Don't be a stranger, baby
Cuz I ain't changing, baby
Don't be a stranger, baby
Cuz I ain't changing, baby
Don't be a stranger, stranger
Cuz I ain't changing, changing
