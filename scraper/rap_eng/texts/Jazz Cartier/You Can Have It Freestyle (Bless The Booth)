[Verse 1]
Never got it, pussy wide, had to pay
Nigga I'm a legend in my city, check the accolades
I was in the cab pick, shorty off on adulate
She told me she a fifth year student, tryna’ graduate
Look with these pictures that I convey, I do not conversate
Bitches, they call me Jacuzzi or Cartier
New shit from México, she tell me ándele
Call me her doctor, so I got to operate
Welcome to the Hell recital, I don’t get along with a self-entitled
I moonwalk in a room with Michael
Musket shootin’ afterwards, shove a rifle
I’m more Teagan than Yan in China
That Jaguar be the new Messiah
Went to Hell and back, I even tipped the driver
Got my dick bust by your bitch saliva
I’m the topic of discussion, I know you niggas hatin’
Before you stick your nose in, know the situation
I can’t lie or nothin’, I might die before I’m 25 or somethin’
Hear that fire comin, I got a driver comin’
I got a place small, niggas tryin’ something
[HNNGH!]
From Singapore to Corpus Christi
No free shows, recording milly, don’t attend me
Raped the house, drawers were empty
Cut the check, I cut you slack
Need my Benz, need my stacks
Fuck me over, hunch your back
It’s a foreign, I don’t lack
Fuck you say? Hold that thought, run that back! [HNNGH!]
