[Verse 1]
Look
I been feelin' lonely for some time now
Can I connect with you, maybe have sex with you
A lot been blessing you, can I invest in you
Top flight how I'm protecting you
I'm projecting you might head up my boo thang
I love you like a moon loves to swang
I love you like a phone loves to ring, how a desert loves to rain, how a bird loves to sing, I'm back on that shit
Love you like a trampoline lovin' a backflip
Love you like a [?],love a hip
Love a gun, love a clip
I'm a little more polished now
I'm way more conscious now
I can recognize game from a 100 yards away
Throw that ass like Shay
Love you like blood loves [?], like Tara loves stay
Like Thomas Jefferson use to love upon the slaves
Like, Donald Trump loves the KKK
I love you like confederate flags in the deep South
I love you like white girls love them cornrows and tanned skin and big fake asses that no one has [?]
Maybe they hope that, maybe they know that
We didn't notice
I love you like, like Clark loves Lois
I'm a little more focused than I was back then
Back when, I wrote songs for the PM
Love you like a real man should
I need to take you way more
I need to give you love at the core
I love you like Adam loves Eve
'Cause even thoughshe ate from the tree that's his wife and they ride together
Like, they the [?]
We fly together, yeah

Love like this, like
Love like this like
Love like  {?] loves lightning
Love like Aria loves [?]
Love like a cell of the wind, like a [?] of the wind
Like a nigga loves to sin
I know I ain't shit, you ain't have to tell me
Love you like Tora to his rally
Love kissing on your belly
Love going deep down, down south
Love you like Paul Wall loves a grill in his mouth
Look
Like everybody loves to be a rapper
Like everybody loves to take what trash that they hear while I got up with my bag
Now they mad but I love all y'all, look
Love you like a gold digger loves an All Star
Like a nigga loves a pornstar
Like a nigga loves them sports cars
Driving all slow on the boulevard
Crawl through the hood, I'm a creep
Waist deep like Tyreese
Love making good
Just know imma love you like I always should
Just know imma do....
