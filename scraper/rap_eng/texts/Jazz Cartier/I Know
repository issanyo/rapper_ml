You not one for taking demands (damn, hol' up)
I know that you know that I am the shit (Right?)
I know that you know Jacuzzi legit (Right?)
You know my life is a movie, and

[Verse 2]
This one night me and two tings had a threesome
They were all for it, I'm top five in the six side
Ask anybody they all know it
I never trip, I never slip
I spit game they fall for it
Cuzzi had to raise the bar on 'em
Had to cut the shit like a lawn mower
Never stop crossing my mind
I see potential and baby I look till I'm blind
Leave all you exes behind
Love and no limits, no crossing no lines
(Love and no limits, no crossing no lines)
Promise me you'll never tell me a lie
(Promise me you'll never tell me a lie)
Promise me you'll never tell me goodbye
