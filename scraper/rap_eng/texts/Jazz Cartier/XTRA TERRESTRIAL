[Intro]
Jet life, let me up

[Verse 1]
If we on the team, we ain't sharin' different goals
We came from nothin' and we did it on our own
I appreciate the highs, can't forget about the lows
Young nigga steady comin' out the cold, woah
I need a milli by next year
Don't it feel good when the check clear
I've been on cruise control, you really don't wanna see me and my next gear
On track, he make it louder
No love for you cowards
Why your face so sour?
I've just been takin' my chances
From my dungeon to a mansion
I Diddy bop in the Hamptons
And MMMBop like the Hanson's
Big wolf on campus
Come pop it for the camera
Met a ting from Atlanta
Try to tell me she a dancer
And I keep my bidness in tact
I say a prayer every morning
I keep them demons off my back
She say "Cuzzi please relax"
Go and tell 'em I'm relaxed
And everyday I'm spittin' facts, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm xtra terrestrial
The plug, the professionnal (it's a cold case)
Niggas they be blowin' smoke (oh woo, oh woo)
Fuck it, we gon' let 'em know (let 'em know)
Situation's gettin' sticky
My nigga rollin' with the blicky (my nigga rollin' with the blicky)
Young nigga from the city
It's really hard to miss me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Ay, ay, ay
I got a penny for thought (yeah)
Look at the niggas that came at Jacuzzi, promise you many have lost (lost)
We are not losing this toast (yeah)
I keep my bags in the vault (yeah)
Say you a real nigga but my shit pop, how it never your fault?
Livin' my cause and effect
I'ma go grind for the check
We gon' pull up in the Porsche then we gon' leave in the jet
Then we gon' even the bet, ay
I see you talkin' instead of makin' a record but don't wanna see me obsessed
Momma, tellin' me I need sleep
Tell her "I'm gonna sleep when I'm dead"
Bitches are losing their minds
I take em two at a time
She will not fuck with a swine
The moment I fuck her and leave her, Jacuzzi gon' be on her mind
You want my time you gotta pay
But I ain't payin' you no mind
I've been out of space, out of my mind

[Chorus]
I'm xtra terrestrial
The plug, the professionnal
Niggas they be blowin' smoke (oh woo, oh woo)
Fuck it, we gon' let 'em know (let 'em know)
Situation's gettin' sticky
My nigga rollin' with the blicky (my nigga rollin' with the blicky)
Young nigga from the city
It's really hard to miss me, yeah

I'm xtra terrestrial
The plug, the professionnal
Niggas they be blowin' smoke (oh woo, oh woo)
Fuck it, we gon' let 'em know (let 'em know)
Situation's gettin' sticky
My nigga rollin' with the blicky (my nigga rollin' with the blicky)
Young nigga from the city
It's really hard to miss me, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, pssh
[?]
Cuzzi man, yeah
