[Chorus]
As God as my witness
Money is my new religion
And I put that on all of my niggas
Won't stop 'til we get us a million, I promise
As God as my witness
Money is my new religion
And I put that on all of my niggas
Won't stop 'til we get us a million, I promise

[Post-Chorus]
And I promise
(Riding in that porsche, hide a million from the lord)
Money is my new religion
I put that on all of my niggas
As God as my witness
And I promise
(Riding in that porsche, hide a million from the lord)
Money is my new religion
I put that on all of my niggas
As God as my witness

[Verse 1]
I fill up my sorrows in bottles and drink like I don't want tomorrow
(Don't do that 'Cuzzi, relax)
So many pills in my cabinet but life is the hardest to swallow
(Don't do that 'Cuzzi, relax)
My pockets been hollow, but lately I feel like I just won the lotto
(I just be thumbing through bands)
And my niggas still pitchin' Kane, you would think that they played in Chicago
Finesse and I jug, finesse and I jug
I'm Kanye with shrugs
Hard to be sane on these drugs
I promised I'd quit but I can't get enough
Diamonds on my neck, I'm a diamond in the rough
As I lay on this rug
I'm still connected, I get the low from my plug
Fill my cup up with mud

[Chorus]
As God as my witness
Money is my new religion
And I put that on all of my niggas
Won't stop 'til we get us a million, I promise

As God as my witness
Money is my new religion
And I put that on all of my niggas
Won't stop 'til we get us a million, I promise

[Post-Chorus]
And I promise
(Riding in that porsche, hide a million from the lord)
Money is my new religion
I put that on all of my niggas
As God as my witness

And I promise
(Riding in that porsche, hide a million from the lord)
Money is my new religion
I put that on all of my niggas
As God as my witness

[Verse 2]
Remember them days in Atlanta my mama just copped an Armada
(Don't do that 'Cuzzi, relax)
I was losing my life in Niagra, I figured I die in Nevada
(Don't do that 'Cuzzi, relax)
Burning my money so blasphemous, but listen cause this the cantata
(I just be thumbing through bands)
My dad prolly dead but I swore that he would when he would when he bailed on my mama
Finesse and I jug, finesse and I jug
Rollin hard in this hard club
My bitch so chilli that she won't let me be a scrub
Just to keep it a buck
Throwing my money so much you would think I'm a clutz
In the Benji I trust
All of my bands came in clutch
The moment I step to the judge
And I promise

[Chorus]
As God as my witness
Money is my new religion
And I put that on all of my niggas
Won't stop till we get us a million, I promise

As God as my witness
Money is my new religion
And I put that on all of my niggas
Won't stop till we get us a million, I promise

[Post-Chorus]
And I promise
(Riding in that porsche, hide a million from the lord)
Money is my new religion
I put that on all of my niggas
As God as my witness

And I promise
(Riding in that porsche, hide a million from the lord)
Money is my new religion
I put that on all of my niggas
As God as my witness

[Outro]
(Riding in that porsche, hide a million from the lord)
(Riding in that porsche, hide a million from the lord)
(Riding in that porsche, hide a million from the lord)
