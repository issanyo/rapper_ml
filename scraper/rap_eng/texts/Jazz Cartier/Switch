[Verse 1]
What is the deal?, nigga
Let's keep it real, nigga
I'm under your skin want something to win
How does it feel?, nigga
Everybody tell me I'm the bad guy
When niggas always get up on my bad side
And bitches want to come and take pic of me
Pretty nigga, I ain't never had a bad side
Bad boys nigga im the anchor of the franchise (never take an L)
Always win it by a landslide
Finna go ham for my niggas in the sandlot
Niggas ain't winning long as cuzzi be on lantz side
Yeah right tap out, won't stop til you tap out, won't stop til you pass out
Black out, black out (black out, black out)
Switch

[Hook]
We ain't on the same side
We ain't in the same league
I stay down with my niggas
And i ain't never switched teams
Switch
Nigga all we do is win
But ya'll don't know what that means
Cause ya'll niggas ain't down
Ya'll niggas switched teams
Switch

[Half of the hook repeated slowed]

[Verse 2]
I am no fucking beginner
I am a ignorant nigga
I eat you niggas for dinner
I'm bout to head to the lot
Cop me a bimmer, fuck it throw on the spinners
Pardon my manners, my girl got a body from 'bana
Hand always covered in henna
Shout out to my lawyer for buckin' my charges
Cause i am not built for the slimmer
Red hot, red dot, nigga head shot
All the bread talk, I'm gon' put it to a dead stop
My dreadlocks make the feds stop
My niggas gonna change clothes when the threads pop
GHS nigga, you know that we the best nigga, do i gotta say it twice to you deaf niggas
GHS nigga, you know that we the best nigga, whether, winter time, summer time, we ain't never stress nigga
Cuzzi
