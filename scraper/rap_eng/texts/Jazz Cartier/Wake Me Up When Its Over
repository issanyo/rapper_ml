[Hook]
These nights get colder and colder
Now I'm nowhere near sober
I fell asleep on your shoulder
Just wake me up when its over
These nights get colder and colder
Now I'm nowhere near sober
I fell asleep on your shoulder
Just wake me up when its over

Wake me up when its over
Wake me up when its over
Now I'm nowhere near sober
I fell asleep on your shoulder
Just wake me up when its over
Wake me up when its over
Wake me up when its over
Wake me up when its over

[Verse 1]
Pretty girl with the necklace
Time is money baby, may I have a second
You just wanna be connected
Show up to the club, your name is on the guest list
You've been single for a year
You fall in love every time you look in the mirror
Why every time I turn around you disappear
Where'd you go, let me know

[Hook]
These nights get colder and colder
Now I'm nowhere near sober
I fell asleep on your shoulder
Just wake me up when its over
These nights get colder and colder
Now I'm nowhere near sober
I fell asleep on your shoulder
Just wake me up when its over

Wake me up when its over
Wake me up when its over
Now I'm nowhere near sober
I fell asleep on your shoulder
Just wake me up when its over
Wake me up when its over
Wake me up when its over
Wake me up when its over

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I miss you like I miss my momma
But you be tripping miss me with the drama
You need some water and you need a minute
Ye you told me drive slow, why you catching speeding tickets
I been many places, I've seen many faces
Party amongst the rich, and even with the basics
Shit is crazy, feeling like I'm chasing daily
But when I'm next to you, its when I feel the safest

[Hook]
These nights get colder and colder
Now I'm nowhere near sober
I fell asleep on your shoulder
Just wake me up when its over
These nights get colder and colder
Now I'm nowhere near sober
I fell asleep on your shoulder
Just wake me up when its over

Wake me up when its over
Wake me up when its over
Now I'm nowhere near sober
I fell asleep on your shoulder
Just wake me up when its over
Wake me up when its over
Wake me up when its over
Wake me up when its over

[Bridge]
Wake me up, up, up  (x8)

[Hook]
These nights get colder and colder
Now I'm nowhere near sober
I fell asleep on your shoulder
Just wake me up when its over
These nights get colder and colder
Now I'm nowhere near sober
I fell asleep on your shoulder
Just wake me up when its over

Wake me up when its over
Wake me up when its over
Now I'm nowhere near sober
I fell asleep on your shoulder
Just wake me up when its over
Wake me up when its over
Wake me up when its over
Wake me up when its over
