[Verse]
I am a monster (Cuzzi a monster)
I went from eating McDonalds to eating this Lobster (straight from the bottom)
My bitch is a Telli, that mean that her daddy a mobster
I know that you heard I got shit going up at my concert (I know that you know it man)
At 22 look at all of the shit I accomplished (you couldn't do this man)
I just hit a lick and you know I got Lantz as accomplice (I just had to do it man)
If I'm the track then you know it's getting demolished (know that I beat it man)
Thank god for the music (Thank god for the music), cause I woulda been kicked outta college (see me on CNN)
Fuck all you niggas for breaking this promise (no don't do that Cuzzi relax)
Pay me your dues when you pay me that homage (pay me in benjamins)
Come to my city, I'll show you it's Gotham (know that I show you man)
Lantz tell me get em, you know that I got em

*Gunshot*
