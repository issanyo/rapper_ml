[Intro]
Yeah
Let's kill 'em Krinny
Let's kill 'em Krinny
Let's get it
(L-l-let's go)
X, all the money

[Chorus]
Opp shit, pop shit
They brought guns I brought roses to the mosh pit
I don't fuck with Britney she too toxic
I was off that Whitney, no conscience
Opp shit, pop shit
They brought guns I brought roses to the mosh pit
I don't fuck with Britney she too toxic
I was off that Whitney, no conscience

[Verse 1]
I can't be touched, ring ring, I can't be touched
Sipping lean off BBW's
Might need me some repercussions
Them niggas got too comfy, too many niggas be bluffing
Now they want to say we cousins
Count my green in bundles
Sipping on two White Russians
Hugging the blunt, loving the life
Money and drugs, she want a wonderful night
Ring ring, don't waste my time
Ring ring, like all the time
On God finna lose my mind
Tell that bitch don't waste my time
Said she born up in '96 and all she wanna do is 69

[Chorus]
Opp shit, pop shit
They brought guns I brought roses to the mosh pit
I don't fuck with Britney she too toxic
I was off that Whitney, no conscience
Opp shit, pop shit
They brought guns I brought roses to the mosh pit
I don't fuck with Britney she too toxic
I was off that Whitney, no conscience

[Verse 2]
Run it back when you see (Cuzzi)
Wifey bad and boujee, stacking paper up like loose leaf
Run it back when you see
When the club refuse me
Now they want to fuck Jacuzzi
Too much dank I don't roll petty
I don't roll petty, I keep all my hoes pretty
Too much static, they don't want static
They don't want static, in my Saint Laurent jacket
Had to go, grew up dirty by the stove
Now I line them up and knock 'em down like it be dominos
Domino, domino, it's the effect, money feel it in me gotta know
Slim thick mixed with some Navajo
She my type like a Java code
Cuzzi I just want the guacamole
Common like the cold

[Chorus]
Opp shit, pop shit
They brought guns I brought roses to the mosh pit
I don't fuck with Britney she too toxic
I was off that Whitney, no conscience
Opp shit, pop shit
They brought guns I brought roses to the mosh pit
I don't fuck with Britney she too toxic
I was off that Whitney, no conscience

[Outro]
