[Intro: Larry June]
Goddamn
Good job 1st

[Verse 1: Larry June]
Get your money up and then you go to war (err, err, err)
Tell it like Sons of Anarchy, biker boy (damn, damn, damn)
Wrist on ten, did it again (yeehee, yeehee)
I might never ever smoke a swish again
Bust-bust-bust-bustdown Rollie, spent
Ask my jeweler (racks nigga)
Orange face on it got a nigga dancing stupid
I wonder how it feel to make a million off of music (god)
The most underrated (ayy bitch, hand me that Uzi)
Six bags for the Chanel bag, she be swaggin'
Balenciaga croptop, goin' crazy
Drop-top, two bops, a Mercedes
Bitch stpo, don't play, gotta pay me (yeehee, yeah baby)
Going through the pain, barely see the gain
Hit it when I can, fuck the rap game

[Chorus: Larry June]
Healthy nigga
Fast cars, weed smoke
Bad bitches, yeah I got 'em by the flock
She want a healthy nigga
She want a healthy nigga
Trap, trap nigga
Fast cars, weed smoke
Bad bitches, yeah I got 'em by the flock
She want a healthy nigga
She want a healthy nigga
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy

[Verse 2: Jazz Cartier]
Always on the job, Bentley or the Mas'
First I take my girl to yoga then I take her to the spa
Bitch I'm from Toronto, ain't nobody switchin' sides
Gordon Ramsay in the kitchen when I'm whippin' up a pie
I got two types of hoes, fried chickens and the salads
A stripper and a regular, I gotta keep the blanace
I'm posted up in Bali's with a chick I met from Dallas
She said Cuzzi how come you nothing like all these other rappers?
First off baby I exfoliate
If your Rollie fake I do not associate
Told my agent up the price, don't negotiate
No no no, I'm no masseuse baby, but I do do facials (Jacuzzi)

[Chorus: Larry June]
Healthy nigga
Fast cars, weed smoke
Bad bitches, yeah I got 'em by the flock
She want a healthy nigga
She want a healthy nigga
Trap-trap nigga
Fast cars, weed smoke
Bad bitches, yeah I got 'em by the flock
She want a healthy nigga
She want a healthy nigga
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy

[Verse 3: Larry June]
I just bought another Rollie 'cause I wanted one (goddamn)
They try to rob me (shit), I keep the forty (yes lord)
Lemon squeeze, Glock tucked in my bitch bag
That's a Birkin (ayy), my pockets swollen
I got-I got model hoes (shit), I got normals (goddamn)
Hit it from the back, make a porno (yes lord)
I'm that nigga (real me), I'm that guy (yeehee)
I missed your cup, I was high (sorry sweetie)
I got neck at Benihanas (ayy ayy ayy)
She said she wanna suck it (yeehee), she was honest (good job)
I sent that bitch to Trader Joes for some saké (saké)
She chose up, yeah I got her (yes lord, sock it to me)
Ayy ayy ayy

[Chorus: Larry June]
Healthy nigga
Fast cars, weed smoke
Bad bitches, yeah I got 'em by the flock
She want a healthy nigga
She want a healthy nigga
Trap nigga
Fast cars, weed smoke
Bad bitches, yeah I got 'em by the flock
She want a healthy nigga
She want a healthy nigga
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
