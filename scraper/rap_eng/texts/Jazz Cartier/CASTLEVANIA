[Chorus]
Alien spaceship tryna catch me since they net me but they can't
Shorty get testy, switch like lefty, bob and weave like Cassius Clay
Life so messy, prices hefty, like the pictures that I paint
Outta my way, outta my way
Yeah, you get out of my way
Alien spaceship tryna catch me since they net me but they can't
Shorty get testy, switch like lefty, bob and weave like Cassius Clay
Too many talking, switch that jargon
Tell that bitch get out of my face
Outta my face, outta my face
Yeah, bitch, get out of my face

[Verse]
Creeping with my dogs tonight, creeping through the halls at night
Sky is falling, dodge the light
I'm far from the modest type
Listen to my conscience, feel them crawlin'
Yeah, they often bite
I'm an artist, I've been starvin'
Why they wanna take my plate?
Nail in the coffin, mommy's bawlin'
Try to revive him but they can't
Eyes be twitching, mind your own business
Wrist stay whipping like Jermaine
Money [?] penny pinching
JLF thats on my grave
Diamond [?] look like Usher but I'm diving out of space
Dance with demons, we break even
I wake up and then I pray
Petal garden, don't beg pardons
Fuck with me and meet the gang
Here the snakes, show your face
Here they go, stay away

[Chorus]
Alien spaceship tryna catch me since they net me but they can't
Shorty get testy, switch like lefty, bob and weave like Cassius Clay
Life so messy, prices hefty, like the pictures that I paint
Outta my way, outta my way
Yeah, you get out of my way
Alien spaceship tryna catch me since they net me but they can't
Shorty get testy, switch like lefty, bob and weave like Cassius Clay
Too many talking, switch that jargon
Tell that bitch get out of my face
Outta my face, outta my face
Yeah, bitch, get out of my face
