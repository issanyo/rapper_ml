La Fleur
New City, New Legend
Huh?
Look

[Verse 1]
It feels like I'm back, for the first time (shit)
But I told you I was "slappin' on shit"
Lot of niggas turn they back on me
But now, I'm back homie
No need to tell you that I'm back on my shit
Now I'm searchin' for balance
In need of a challenge
I used to sleep in the dungeon, now I'm the king of the palace
Niggas love it when you start from nothing (they do)
Until I started something (I did)
I think I'm on to something (I am)
Nigga, you all fuckin' jealous
I turned the city in a year, nigga
Who is you? And when did you appear, nigga?
Your bullshit is not poppin' over here, nigga
"Dead hoe, saint", is all that I hear, nigga
Quiet nigga, but I'm wise for my words
I know some niggas want me lyin' in dirt
Fa-fa-fa-fuck you and your feature, I'm denying the verse
Cuz I got, two on the hook, and ones on the verse
You see, the lamest niggas hate us all (but fuck em')
But I'll just make a call
You gon' have to go to church, and pray the Lord to save you all
Catch you slippin', have the blue or white tip you all
And forensics and detectives have to scrape the wall
So we got all your prayers, I came out of the layer
I'm in the dungeon with yo nanny, taught me how to prepare
Hot headed as fuck, but never doubted Isaiah
But thanks to him, I'm the cities most valuable player
Now I got lean in my cup, then I'll mix it with Sprite
I got Lantz on the beat, that shit will shit on your life
And that's word to my mamma, she don't know how I'm livin'
But I'mma show her, I promise, cuz this shit is a given
I ain't gon' test you niggas, cuz I left you niggas
Have the girl and she, she never met you, nigga
They wonder how the street nigga came from pest you nigga
To talk to me, you gon' need more than a step stool, nigga
Cuzzi bitch
