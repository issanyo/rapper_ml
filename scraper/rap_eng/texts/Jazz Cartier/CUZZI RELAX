[Intro]
Welcome, welcome
JLF

[Chorus]
Yuh, yuh
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Cuzzi relax, Cuzzi relax, Cuzzi relax
Bitch I'm relaxed, shit
Woah woah woah woah
Woah, woah, woah
Cuzzi relax, Cuzzi relax, Cuzzi relax
Bitch I'm relaxed

[Verse]
Bitch I'm relaxed
The city is under attack
I was just bridgin' the gap
I have no time to react
We was just adding it up
No, we can never subtract
Niggas don't want me to- uh, wait
Niggas don't want me to *blah*
Carti' was still in the south
Fuck it I'm taking it back
Cuzzi ain't no Uncle Sam
Fuck it man, I'm finna tax
She put that thing in my lap
Ride with that thing in the lap
They try to copy the cat
But they can't do with like Jazz
If we not homies then- uh, wait
Please don't be hitting my jack
If we not homies then- uh, wait
You need to get the fuck back
I come with the heat, Tony [?]
You can not fit on my axis
We can get straight to the action
Don't tell me to chill, I'm relaxin'

[Pre-Chorus]
You need to get on my level
I put my [?] on the pedal
I am a maniac, a rockstar, but we don't bang heavy metal
I [?] her like a [?]
She wanna give me the top
So I just kiss her goodbye
Skrt in that 'rari, go ride

[Chorus]
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Cuzzi relax, Cuzzi, relax
Cuzzi relax, bitch I'm relaxed
Shit
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Cuzzi relax, Cuzzi relax
Cuzzi relax, bitch I'm relaxed
