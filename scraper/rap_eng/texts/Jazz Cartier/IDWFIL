[Intro]
I don't wanna fall in love, no
Better than the rest, they don't even come close

[Verse 1]
Hey, shawty you should come and kick it
Tour out in Europe, yeah you should come and visit
Just give me the day, I can book the ticket
If I take a shot, you know I'm never missin'
Big bands on me, now she wanna be my missus
Whole time I was tryna look for some different
Everytime I turn around I feel like some's missin'
I told you I would do it and I did it (oh)
She don't want no Gucci she want Jacuzzi
Ice, ice, baby Kristi Yamaguchi
People say they know me, they never knew me
I don't wanna fall in love girl this ain't the movies
Got me actin' foolish

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fall in love, no
Better than the rest, they don't even come close
I don't wanna fall in love, no
Better than the rest, they don't even come close

[Verse 2]
And I can't take you for granted
Love they give and take 'til the day yout took advantage, damn it
Now I think you more than I can manage
Damsel, distress, loadin' up the canon, heartbreak
Never thought you'd do this type of damage
Way back when you was still livin' up in Ajax
Yeah I went away but you was happy that I came back
Wanted you to stay true and you remain that
When everything was goin' right, you was goin' left
I'm a dog, throw a bone, then I'm gon' fetch
If you give a man the world then it won't last
So leave your feelings at the doorstep
Catch Carter come on bring the chorus in

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fall in love, no
Better than the rest they don't even come close
I don't wanna fall in love, no
Better than the rest they don't even come close

[Outro]
