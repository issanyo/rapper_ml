[Intro]
Ay, ay
Ay, I can't
I can't, I can't, I can't
Ay, ay

[Chorus]
Which one? (Which?)
Gucci, Louis, which one? (Woo)
Two bad hoes, can't pick none (woo)
Rari, Lambo, switched 'em (what?)
Then I skr (skr)
Pull up on the curb (woo, yeah)
They like, "What's the word?" (Woo, what?)
Always coming first (woo, ay)
I wake up like, "Which one?" (Which one?)
Gucci, Louis, which one? (What?)
Two bad hoes, can't pick one (pick one)
Rari, Lambo, switched 'em (switch, switch, switch)
Then I skr (ah, skr, skr, skr)
Pull up on the curb (ah)
They like, "What's the word?" (woo, ah)
Always coming first (woo, which one?)

[Verse]
Okay, they call me Cuzzi, baby
Hair be lookin' wavy (so crazy)
My girl don't talk, look how she walk
It's like she from the 80's (go, baby)
Last night she pulled up in that Beamer
And left it in the 'Cedes (I see you)
I've been the one, you niggas lazy
Ballin' like McGrady (Cuzzi, relax)
I pull up in the free skill, freak out
No hand out, my nigga, don't reach out (don't)
You got an issue with La Fleur, nigga, speak out (speak)
I'm the big beast in the street now (God damn)
I used to be a little bo peep 'til my daddy got a jeep
I was ridin' on big wheels (big wheels)
Nowadays, I can't sleep, through 7 in a week
Can't say I'm not a big deal (big deal)
My kick back looking like tip drill (ow)
Getting to the money, can't sit still (ow)
Please do not come with excuses
If I can't use 'em, they useless, Cuzzi

[Chorus]
Which one? (Which?)
Gucci, Louis, which one? (Woo)
Two bad hoes, can't pick none (woo)
Rari, Lambo, switched 'em (what?)
Then I skr (skr)
Pull up on the curb (woo, yeah)
They like, "What's the word?" (Woo, what?)
Always coming first (woo, ay)
I wake up like, "Which one?" (Which one?)
Gucci, Louis, which one? (What?)
Two bad hoes, can't pick one (pick one)
Rari, Lambo, switched 'em (switch, switch, switch)
Then I skr (ah, skr, skr, skr)
Pull up on the curb (ah)
They like, "What's the word?" (woo, ah)
Always coming first (woo, which one?)
