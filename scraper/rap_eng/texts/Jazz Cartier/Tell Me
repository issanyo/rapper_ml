[Intro: River Tiber]
Tell me, tell me
You can tell me, you can tell me

[Verse 1: Jazz Cartier]
You need some rest
I need the Advil when I read your texts
We should take a little break or somethin' and just reconnect
You're so passive-aggressive when asking me questions
I miss dancing with you
Make a little dinner with the candles with you
You need a timeout and I been blowing the whistle
So if you come back bring some manners with you
Know what I'm talking about

[Pre-Chorus: Jazz Cartier]
I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm out
(yeah)
You claim that you shy, but you running your mouth
(yeah)
Baby come do what you talking about
(yeah)
The neighbours gon' think you the man of the house
(ow)

[Chorus: River Tiber]
Whatever it's worth girl you can tell me
You can tell me
Don't mean to say a word, but you can tell me
You can tell me
Whatever it's worth girl you can tell me
You can tell me
Don't mean to say a word, but you can tell me
You can tell me

[Verse 2: Jazz Cartier]
This is how I feel
I feel beige
I wrote this song for you
But are we on the same page?
How about we run away
Ride dolphins eat lobsters
Shit, even bathe in champagne
Let's get married in Southern California
I heard it never rains
And life's like an evening in August, I can't complain
I can have em Donna Changs
But I'll be happy with Elaine
Can you see the beauty in a canvas?
Even when it's blank
Pick me up after you're finished and all of my remains

[Pre-Chorus: Jazz Cartier]
I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm out
(yeah)
You claim that you shy, but you running your mouth
(yeah)
Baby come do what you talking about
(yeah)
The neighbours gon' think you the man of the house
(ow)

[Chorus: River Tiber]
Whatever it's worth girl you can tell me
You can tell me
Don't mean to say a word, but you can tell me
You can tell me
Whatever it's worth girl you can tell me
You can tell me
Don't mean to say a word, but you can tell me
You can tell me
Whatever it's worth girl you can tell me
You can tell me
Don't mean to say a word, but you can tell me
You can tell me
Whatever it's worth girl you can tell me
You can tell me
Don't mean to say a word, but you can tell me
You can tell me
