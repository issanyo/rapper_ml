[Verse]
Look
I don't follow suit
My backhand's like Serena when I follow through
I'd end up in a ditch if I followed you
My focus is gettin' rich and taking care of the clique, oh shit
Flowers in a bed, you know where I been
I can name a lot friends that done came and went
And my emotions like "money well spent"
I'm a cold-hearted nigga, I don't ever feel shit (ice cold)
My walls can talk, my phone is tapped
My heart is gold, my lungs are black
My accountant call, my funds intact
I ain't burn no bridge, that bitch collapsed
Off of six stages read the Bible backwards
Get the money out the case and get the title after
No time for certain-title rappers
And when I laps around you niggas, we can cycle after
I ain't even shine the vision on 'em
Had hits and I was sittin' on 'em
I get it daily like the vision on 'em
*Beep* I got it written on me
I got this spot 'cause you was slippin' on it, yeah
And I can never take advice from a broke nigga
I got plenty opportunities to show nigga
It's La Fleur, have you not see the growth nigga?
Wake up in the morning, think about it, then I go get it, oh nigga
No fish around me, I'm not Long John Silver
4th and long and now I gotta strong arm niggas
And my momma need a house in Jamaica
Now how I'm finna get it if I talk on Twitter?
Now you boys don't work with me in the slightest
I just think about it then I write it
I pour gas and ignite it
I got your girls on her knees, if you seen her you would think she's gettin' knighted
I'm tap dancin' upon broken glass
My accounts open over draft
As I stumble out the overpass
They upset, everything I do [wack?]
Tryna stop me at the net I coulda swore my name was Arthur Ashe
Heaven's no destination
I'm playin' fetch with Satan
I got the world in my hands, watch me decorate it
I fell asleep in the trap, woke up, a blunt on my lap
City's still on my back, I got this sinister vision of how I should be livin'
I'm no angel momma, I've made some wrong decisions
That's why I'm stuck inside the stu' to make an honest livin'
My only flaw is women, can't get it robbing, giving, nah
Now this the part where the plot thickens
Headshots 'til I drop niggas
On every track a whole pac' listens
Until it made you got a stock vision
Yeah the name is Cartier but that ain't never mean that I watch niggas
I feel the pressure more than ever now
I keep tellin' myself to settle down
Friends askin' for a favor, they was never 'round
We all know my time is comin', you ain't even gotta want to say the name, nigga
Cuzzi
