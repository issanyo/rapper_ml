[Verse 1]
One with my thoughts
The one with the plot
The one with the shot
When will it stop?
When will it not?
When I'm at the top
I let the cat out the bag
I'm not an admirable man
I am a liar, I am a cheat
I am becoming my dad
I got some blood on the leaves
I got some blood on my hands
All of my money is dirty
I got some blood on my bands
Niggas be boostin' they place
I just been boostin' my stacks
Niggas still lie on they dick
And I used to lie in my raps
Now looking back all of them facts
My style giving birth to you niggas, plants
Look at these niggas, all of them cats, all of 'em Jazz
Old Jacuzi, I'm the one they lovin' to hate
Everybody run they mouth but still they pockets out of shape
All you niggas do is tweet, boy your words don't carry weight
But if you kill me 'fore I do just bring some flowers at my wake
Ya heard?

[Hook]
I told my bitch to hold my weight just in case yeah
I keep my bands up in my safe just in case yeah
Them boys might just run up in my place just in case yeah
So pick the day and choose your fate just in case yeah
I told my bitch to hold my weight just in case yeah
I keep my bands up in my safe just in case yeah
Them boys might just run up in my place just in case yeah
So pick the day and choose your fate just in case yeah

[Verse 2]
It's gon' take an army to get La Fleur
With all of my words I can hit a nerve
I know they want me dead, I just wasn't sure
I pull off in a 'Rari and hit a curb
But the baby the sequel is get the work
My hobby is watchin' my riches burn
Jacuzi can make all them kitties purr
So get out of my way and don't interfere
Holy shit, let's get it poppin'
She call me papi, I call it attraction
I'ma take out for my actions
What niggas don't want no static
I maybe over the top but y'all niggas over dramatic
Paradise or paranoia, I'm only 22 shittin' out classics

[Hook]
I told my bitch to hold my weight just in case yeah
I keep my bands up in my safe just in case yeah
Them boys might just run up in my place just in case yeah
So pick the day and choose your fate just in case yeah
I told my bitch to hold my weight just in case yeah
I keep my bands up in my safe just in case yeah
Them boys might just run up in my place just in case yeah
So pick the day and choose your fate just in case yeah
