[Pre-Hook]
Yeah we've been mixin' too much
All my emotions are numb
Feel like I can't get enough
Nah, if you keep dancin' on me
Girl, we've been mixin' too much
All my emotions are numb
Feel like I can't get enough
Nah, if you keep dancin' on me

[Hook]
Girl, I'll be tempted to touch
Tempted to touch
Feel like I can't get enough
If you keep dancin' on me
Girl, I'll be tempted to touch
Tempted to touch
It's like we alone in this club
If you keep dancin' on me

[Verse 1]
Girl I'll be tempted to touch
I think I just fell in love
It may be you or the drugs
But we need some more in our cups
And so... call me when you're lonely
Yeah, and I leave from the homies
Ooh, ooh, I heard you love it when the light's out
Say the word, baby I can hit the right spot, true
All night I've been ready for you
Your girl told you, "Make a move," they've been tellin' me too
Yeah, you not dealin' with no regular dude
You got niggas lyin' to you, but I'm tellin' the truth

[Refrain]
So... shorty swing my way
Yeah, come be my Ashanti
Hennessy, you can hydrate
You're not dealin' with no lightweight

[Pre-Hook]
Yeah we've been mixin' too much
All my emotions are numb
Feel like I can't get enough
Nah, if you keep dancin' on me
Girl we've been mixin' too much
All my emotions are numb
Feel like I can't get enough
Nah, if you keep dancin' on me

[Hook]
Girl, I'll be tempted to touch
Tempted to touch
Feel like I can't get enough
If you keep dancin' on me
Girl, I'll be tempted to touch
Tempted to touch
It's like we alone in this club
If you keep dancin' on me
Girl, I'll be...

[Verse 2]
Ride it, baby, drive it like you stole it
Lose control, but please don't lose your focus
Findin' love in clubs is always hopeless
Wine your waist and I'll go with the motion
I know you're not materialistic
Come closer, I can't keep my distance
Come over, maybe we can keep it consistent
With your makeup on my shirt, neck covered in lipstick, ooh
We been at it all night, now you in the mood
Really can't wait to see you in the nude
So let me know what you finna do
I'll let you start me... then I'll finish you

[Refrain]
So... shorty swing my way
Yeah, come be my Ashanti
Hennessy, you can hydrate
You're not dealin' with no lightweight

[Pre-Hook]
Yeah we've been mixin' too much
All my emotions are numb
Feel like I can't get enough
Nah, if you keep dancin' on me
Girl, we've been mixin' too much
All my emotions are numb
Feel like I can't get enough
Nah, if you keep dancin' on me

[Hook]
Girl, I'll be tempted to touch
Tempted to touch
Feel like I can't get enough
If you keep dancin' on me
Girl, I'll be tempted to touch
Tempted to touch
It's like we alone in this club
If you keep dancin' on me
Girl, I'll be...
