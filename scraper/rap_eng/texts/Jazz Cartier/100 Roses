[Hook]
100 roses
For the dead
Heard they talking
Where they at?
100 shots
For they head
They don't know me
They don't want it
I'm the man
Now you know it
I'm the man
I'm the coldest

[Verse 1]
Told my mama if I die then put them roses on my casket
If I burn in hell I hope she smoking all my ashes
My city's in the race of whoever make it the fastest
I'm fucking past it, knocking niggas like I'm Cassius
I ain't around, I ain't around
(Where you at?)
I heard they talking down, they talking down
(No they ain't)
You know Jacuzzi got the heat I'm always up to something
But they only talking down cause they ain't up and coming
Niggas talk about they money, boy I never see it
Boy I'm everywhere you're not, I swear I'm never see you
Said you popping in your city, man I don't believe it
But when I come and shut it down, I swear you gonna feel it

[Hook]
100 roses
For the dead
Heard they talking
Where they at?
100 shots
For they head
They don't know me
They don't want it
I'm the man
Now you know it
I'm the man
I'm the coldest

[Verse 2]
Mystery me, mystery me
Dreamed about this shit and then I got it, mission complete
Everybody wanna be the hottest, tryna be me
Laughing when they think they really balling i'm taking the lead
Don't be talking to me bout my product
(Take it and leave)
None of y'all are built for my position
(Take it from me)
Niggas wanna stunt in front of bitches
(But they can't agree)
With Cuzzi in the buildin', I ain't stunting
Then pay me your fee (ah)
I swear to god that I'm heaven sent (ya)
If I die, I'm a legend, this is evidence
They call me JLF, I'm the new JFK
And if I'm going out, I put that on some president
It's Cuzzi bitch

100 roses

Now you know it
I'm the man
I'm the coldest
I'm the man
