[Intro: Ro Ransom]
S, S
Yeah
Go

[Verse 1: Ro Ransom]
In 1OAK lookin' like Aaliyah (woo)
Three Cara Delevingne's and they all tryna FIFA (yeah)
I just got my re-up (skrrt)
Flexin', VIP, mixin' vodka with KeVita
Señorita
I ranked my lifestyle, then got my cheese up (skrrt)
We drop that new shit, yeah, then fuck the streets up (yeah)
She grindin' like she tryna fuck my PVC's up, ease up
I just flooded my stones (yeah)
Ain't no love in my home
(Don't) call the plug on my phone
(Why?) might be thugs on my phone (woo)
Still rock Helmut Lang every day
These hoes love me like I'm Young M.A
New bitch look like Ella-Ay
I just popped a 30, I could fadeaway

[Chorus: Ro Ransom]
Fuck the other side, I'm the prettiest
All my niggas gettin' it
My girl got a Tesla
Best believe we out here whippin' it
Take a model home
Then I fuck her 'til she hideous, yeah
Fuck the other side, I'm the prettiest
All my niggas gettin' it
My girl got a Tesla
Best believe we out here whippin' it
Take a model home
Then I fuck her 'til she hideous

[Verse 2: Jazz Cartier]
You don't know me, get to know me
How you always in the club and you feelin' lonely?
Rubbin' shoulders with the models, smokin' bogies
You into the Adriana's—I need Naomi's
Keep it lowkey (skrrt)
Pour a 4 and smokin' out inside a limousine
Model bitches, they just flew in from the Philippines
They might off a nigga head like a guillotine
Say, "Jacuzzi, you're the prettiest I've ever seen"

[Chorus: Ro Ransom]
Fuck the other side, I'm the prettiest
All my niggas gettin' it
My girl got a Tesla
Best believe we out here whippin' it
Take a model home
Then I fuck her 'til she hideous, yeah
Fuck the other side, I'm the prettiest
All my niggas gettin' it
My girl got a Tesla
Best believe we out here whippin' it
Take a model home
Then I fuck her 'til she hideous

[Bridge: Ro Ransom & Jazz Cartier]
I'm feelin' fever
Fever on the floor
I think I feel a fever
Fever on the floor
Prettiest I've ever seen

[Outro: Kensei Abbot & Jazz Cartier]
The club going up, yeah
The club going up
Prettiest I've ever seen
