[Verse 1]
Feet on the gas
Fuck a cab (ah)
Hit the mall, spend 100 bands (ah)
Leave the mall with 100 bags (ah)
Go home pop 100 tags
You know I'm speeding
Baby, I'm speeding
I got the gas and I'm high as the ceiling
I hear the feds is out, they never see me
I hear the whoop whoop, then I go genie
I'm in that red alert, oh

I'm in  that red alert, oh
Middle finger out the window, any nigga trying to see me
