[Chorus]
See, you wasn't 'bout attraction (no, no, no, no, no)
You were more of a distraction (no, no, no, no, no)
I still had to make it happen (no, no, no, no, no)
But now you got me moving backwards (no, no, no, no, no)
See you wasn't 'bout attraction (no, no, no, no, no)
You were more of a distraction (no, no, no, no, no)
I still had to make it happen (no, no, no, no, no)
But now you got me moving backwards (no, no, no, no, no)

[Verse]
Yeah
I can't get comfortable now
I still feel the ups and the downs
You are my everything, you are my-
Go on for multiple rounds
You was the beat to my drums
And you held it down on the ones
This shit was never amusing
The highest regret I abused it
You've been on the tip of my tongue
I still feel your smoke in my lungs
I was the one with the funds
And you were the one with the fun
Backwoods after long shifts
We ain't airing dirty laundry
Memories that have since faded
Try to find where we went wrong
Where the train stopped, where we get off
If we got off, if you still on
If I'm still here, will you still call?
Am I still needed? Have you moved on?
With a new one or a few ones
Am I too late? Is it past due?
Do you pray for me? If you had to?
If you got married, would you still love me like you once did?
If I asked you, would you say yes?
If it's too much, say less, say less (say less)

[Chorus]
See, you wasn't 'bout attraction (no, no, no, no, no)
You were more of a distraction (no, no, no, no, no)
I still had to make it happen (no, no, no, no, no)
But now you got me moving backwards (no, no, no, no, no)
See, you wasn't 'bout attraction (no, no, no, no, no)
You were more of a distraction (no, no, no, no, no)
I still had to make it happen (no, no, no, no, no)
But now you got me moving backwards (no, no, no, no, no)

[Bridge]
Say yes, say less
Say less, say less, yeah
Say less, ayy
Say less, ayy
