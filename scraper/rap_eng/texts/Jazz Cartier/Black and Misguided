Black and misguided
We so attached to the violence
Black and misguided
We fall asleep to them sirens (sirens)
Black and misguided
I wake up to my mama crying
Black and misguided
Don't listen or we'll start a riot (riot)

[Hook]
Black and misguided, we just so black and misguided
We so attached to the violence
We fell asleep to them sirens (I know)
Black and misguided, we just so black and misguided
We so attached to the violence
We fell asleep to them sirens (I know)

[Post Hook]
God ain't paying my bills, God ain't paying my bills (I know)
So all my niggas gon' kill, all my niggas gon' kill (I know)
God ain't paying my bills, God ain't paying my bills (I know)
So all my niggas gon' kill, all my niggas gon' kill (I know)

[Verse 1]
My daddy's a gangster, my sister a stripper
I know that my nephew gon' grow up a killer
My mama's a soldier, got chips on her shoulder
My cousin a dealer, my uncle a pimp
They aiming to kill us for breaking the system
They crossing us out when they claim to be Christian
Fuck making amends, they making a killin'
I'm sipping and twistin' for niggas in prison
I fuck a religion, you blood or you crippin'
They giving us lies, and feeding the pigeons
I'm painting a picture, they paint us the villain
They stealing the culture, and making a million
So much anger in my heart
One day they gon' fuck with me
All my dogs, they gon' bark
One day they gon' fucking see
Police kill us, and they gon' walk
May all you niggas rest in peace
Place a trail and watch us march
Cause you know that we just

[Verse 2]
Yeah
My daughter's a mama, my son a statistic
My grandmama dieing, that cancer is viscous
I'm stuck on the corner, can't pay her a visit
I'm servin' the fiends, get my auntie addicted
We hittin' the lick, got my bitch on the lookout
Wait for the weekend, and shoot up the cook-out
Been in a rut, running a muck
Why you standin' over there with your foot out?
Call in the casualty
Feelin' like king on that balcony
Babies are born into agony
Niggas will never die happily
What's the American dream?
Sorry to say, it's a fantasy
My demons taught me my reality
So please, do not question my vanity
So much anger in my heart
One day they gon' fuck with me
All my dogs, they gon' bark
One day they gon' fucking see
Police kill us, and they gon' walk
May all you niggas rest in peace
Place a trail and watch us march
Cause you know that we just (I know)
