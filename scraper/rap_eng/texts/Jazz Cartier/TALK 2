[Intro]
L-l-lets go

[Chorus]
I don't want your money I want space (I don't want your money)
Can't nobody put me in my place (can't nobody put me)
I'm not the nigga you should talk to
I'm not the nigga you should talk to
No sequel, you can't get a part two
I break bread with my niggas, break hearts too
I'm not the nigga you should talk to
I'm not the nigga you should talk to

[Verse 1]
Goin' off, got it ringin' the alarm now
Pickin' up at the gate, bring dogs out
Ay, every point gettin' across now (get across now)
I'm at the point, can't take a loss now (I can't take a loss now)
Ay, don't tell nobody, just keep this shit quiet (quiet, quiet)
Yeah, we move in silence, got hitta's on silence (hitta's on silence)
Potato tower gon' play with yo tot
Yeah, straight out the box and 'Cuzzi gon' pop
Tell me what you see when you look inside the mirror?
Is it me? Is it clear?
I need twins you know Tia and Tamara
Got new clients I might pull up in McLaren (skrr, skrr, skrrr)
Roll it up in Rotte'
In the middle of the Summer we was sellin' snow flakes (we was sellin' snow flakes)
Niggas know where I be, I ain't hard to locate (I ain't hard to locate)
I got the juice on OJ, if they talk down it's okay, hey (talk down it's okay)

[Chorus]
I don't want your money I want space (I don't want your money)
Can't nobody put me in my place (can't nobody put me)
I'm not the nigga you should talk to
I'm not the nigga you should talk to
No sequel, you can't get a part two
I break bread with my niggas, break hearts too
I'm not the nigga you should talk to
I'm not the nigga you should talk to

[Verse 2]
I can't make this up, yeah
Kiss me in the kitchen, I'm a wizard with the dishes
I can't fall in love, yeah
Got her fiendin' for Jacuzzi, bitches fillin' up prescriptions
I-I-I don't need receipts, no trace when I ball
(I don't need) no fake friends claimin' day one, I don't recall
Smoke a leaf inside a double R
All that shit was written in the stars (yeah)
Make sure all the numbers are legit (legit)
Goin' 'til I'm white man, make a list
We don't keep the work inside the crib (oh no, no)
We don't do no dirt inside the crib
Talk to me nice or just donâ€™t talk to me
Why must you always make it hard for me?
Everywhere I go you follow me
Always on my shit but you don't follow me

[Chorus]
I don't want your money I want space (I don't want your money)
Can't nobody put me in my place (can't nobody put me)
I'm not the nigga you should talk to
I'm not the nigga you should talk to
No sequel, you can't get a part two
I break bread with my niggas, break hearts too
I'm not the nigga you should talk to
I'm not the nigga you should talk to
