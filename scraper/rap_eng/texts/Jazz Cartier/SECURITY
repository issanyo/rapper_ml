[Chorus]
I gotta get to the bag (I gotta get to the bag)
It's comin' so fast, I pray that it last (momma, I pray that it last)
We comin' in first, you comin' in last (I know you comin' in last)
I walk in the bank and I do my dance
(I gotta, I gotta) I gotta get to the bag

[Verse 1]
I am a phenom (yeah), I am the phenom (yeah)
I am the one with the power, you wanted the power but you are a cleaner (yeah)
Oh, that's your girl? You better watch her, my nigga, 'cause she need a shoulder to lean on
I am the nigga they pree on, niggas be dissin' but I never respond (yeah)
Ain't nobody finna south the vision, dream of a mill in a Honda Civic (yeah)
Stuck in the street, hear my momma trippin' (yeah), now me and my momma sharin' new beginnings (woo)
I wasn't the smartest in class (woo), but I was amazin' at math (yeah)
My ex wanna fuck with me bad, haha

[Chorus]
I gotta get to the bag (I gotta get to the bag)
It's comin' so fast, I pray that it last (momma, I pray that it last)
We comin' in first, you comin' in last (I know you comin' in last)
I walk in the bank and I do my dance
(I gotta, I gotta) I gotta get to the bag (I gotta get to the bag)
It's comin' so fast I pray that it last (pray that it last)
We comin' in first, you comin' in last (I know you comin' in last)
I walk in the bank and I do my dance, damn
(I gotta, I gotta) I gotta get to the bag

[Verse 2]
Please don't say you love me, you don't mean it, lady, slow your roll
Life is just a drug but I seen plenty people lose control
Aye, I don't take nothin' for granted, the money done made me romantic
She say I'm gettin' too fancy, I tell her take off her panties
Isn't it funny how my life is riddled by bitches and money?
They didn't hit me before I was poppin' but now when I jump they gon' listen like Sunny
If she a Mariah, she can call me honey, years in the makin', stop callin' it lucky
If I show up then I'm fresher than Dougie, boy, it's a wrap like a mummy

[Chorus]
I gotta get to the bag (I gotta get to the bag)
It's comin' so fast, I pray that it last (momma, I pray that it last)
We comin' in first, you comin' in last (I know you comin' in last)
I walk in the bank and I do my dance
(I gotta, I gotta) I gotta get to the bag (I gotta get to the bag)
It's comin' so fast I pray that it last (pray that it last)
We comin' in first, you comin' in last (I know you comin' in last)
I walk in the bank and I do my dance, damn
(I gotta, I gotta) I gotta get to the bag
