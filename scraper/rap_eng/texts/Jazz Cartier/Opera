Phantom of the opera
My bitch a prima donna
I'm fucking up these commas
Welcome to the, oh
Phantom of the opera
My bitch a prima donna
I'm fucking up these commas
Welcome to the, oh
Phantom of the opera
Woah, woah, woah
Phantom of the opera

[Post-Hook]
Get it, I got it
I get it now
Get it, I got it
I get it now

[Verse 1]
Oh, momma saw me on the television
I used to tell her it would happen, but she never listened
I send a prayer to my foes, I may as well forgive 'em
I hear the disses, all the disses, but I keep my distance
Oh my, don't call me a friend
How you gonna war with an army of ten?
A price for a feature's an arm and a leg
Eat foods ain't nothing to my dogs in the ends, oh
It's a dead ting, hit the UK for my peng tings
A man like me never beg tings, Cuzzi

[Verse 2]
I'm the new face of the country
Niggas had my names in they mouth so long, so long, I'm immune to assumptions
Labels they hit up my phone like "hello, hello" I'm declining the budget
I'm dipping and dodging, and bucking, and busting
I rose from the ashes, survived the eruption, oh
We put out Marauding, niggas so gossip, I got 'em some coffins
I know that they talkin', but you should go tell 'em, don't step in my garden
But this is the dawn of the dead
So give me the word, and it's off with they heads
