[Intro]
Fleurever
KTOE, Cuzzi, man
This is a KTOE beat
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus]
That booty bouncin' like some 808 (booty, bouncin')
That booty bouncin' like some 808
I remember like it's yesterday (I remember, I remember)
I used to hit it like a fade away (I used to hit, I used to hit)
Said you love me, did you lie?
I used to pull up, did you ride?
I used to pull 'em never slide (never slide, no)
You said you love me, ride or die (ride or die, ooh)
Ride or die, used to-

[Verse 1]
Tell me what you want
You ain't gotta front
Angel in the dark
Aim and hit your mark
She wanna fast forward, I tell her rewind it
Say she wanna give me head, all she need was guidance
Xanny been my change, know your boy's shining
'Rari speedin' hear them sirens, I don't got no license
You came to my door but it's your choice (you)
All the neighbors know my name, lower your voice (shh)
I'm the man not a little boy
I wanna build with you not destroy
Crib lit up like a liquor store
You should see her on a pole

[Chorus]
That booty bouncin' like some 808 (booty, bouncin')
That booty bouncin' like some 808
I remember like it's yesterday (I remember, I remember)
I used to hit it like a fade away (I used to hit, I used to hit)
Said you love me, did you lie?
I used to pull up, did you ride?
I used to pull 'em never slide (never slide, no)
You said you love me, ride or die (ride or die, ooh)
Ride or die, used to-

[Verse 2]
Hey, yeah
She said don't treat me like a ting (please don't)
'Cause she won't visit me if I was in the bin (she will not)
Chasi-chasin' all these bands, I'm in sync
If she hatin' on me prolly 'cause her pussy stink (yeah)
Out of all the niggas in my city organize this
That was for my foes, I don't resort to violence
She was just a side chick , you went and wifed it
I only want her for the night
She my afternoon delight
She cook me breakfast, treat me right
Cartier, I come on time, yeah

[Chorus]
That booty bouncin' like some 808 (booty, bouncin')
That booty bouncin' like some 808
I remember like it's yesterday (I remember, I remember)
I used to hit it like a fade away (I used to hit, I used to hit)
Said you love me, did you lie?
I used to pull up, did you ride?
I used to pull 'em never slide (never slide, no)
You said you love me, ride or die (ride or die, ooh)
Ride or die, used to-

[Outro]
Was it worth it?
