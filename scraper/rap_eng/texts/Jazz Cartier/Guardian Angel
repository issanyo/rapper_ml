[Intro]
Ha ha ha
It's funny ain't it, how life works?
They hate you they love they hate you again, Uh
(I am made in God's image)
You know, God don't like ugly
Ha ha Momma always said that to me
She always said that God loves you Jacuzzi
And I always wondered why?
(I am made in God's image)
They say birds of a feather flock together
But in your case...they don't
You free now, rejoice!
(I am made in God's image)
You gotta take 'em into your world
Cigarette ashes on the bible, late nights
Tell em' so they understand Cuzzi
Tell em' Cuzzi, they need to understand
Where you came from
This anger, Where did it come from?
PARADISE!

[Verse]
My life been a flight with a lot of delays
I prefer blue skies, lately mine have been grey
A little turbulence, but luckily my landing was safe
Couple bodies were laid, on the path that I paved
I was fightin' depression, my spirit may have been broken
These niggas left me to dry, thought Jacuzzi was hopeless
Even with smoke in my mirror, you couldn't fuck with my focus
I had to lay off the drugs, balance out my psychosis
My anxiety tweakin', like feds tapping my phone
I ran away with a dream and didn't plan to come home
I tried to give you a chance, but y'all just brag and you boast
I mean I'm guilty as charged, I'm doing damage controls
Now make sure my throne sterilized, offing all the parasites
Bout to O.D., like I'm Mildred from Fahrenheit
Golden Child, know you know the name, I had to clarify
This is what y'all waited on, welcome y'all to paradise
For real

[Bridge]
God damn
Well ain't dat about a dollar in a bitch
Go ahead, Cuzzi
Glad you got that off yo chest
I always knew your wings were made of plastic
So go ahead and fly
And never come back
It's your time now
You been waiting so long for the motherfucker, fuck you gonna do with it?
I'll wait
And when you reach that castle in the sky
Just make you sure tell them your story
About Marauding In Paradise

[Outro: Mista - Black Molasses]

[Chorus]
Blackberry Molasses
One of the things that never change
You gotta keep pushin' on, the sun don’t rain all the time
There’s gonna be some heartache and pain

[Verse]
Woke up Sunday morning, got a little bad news today
They say my life ain’t worth living, and time is slowly ticking away
Don’t think that I’m goin' crazy, ‘cause thoughts keep runnin’ through my head
I know I gotta be strong, gotta hold on, sometimes I’d rather give up instead
Seems like I’m better off dead

[Chorus]
Blackberry Molasses
One of the things that never change (It'll never change)
You gotta keep pushin' on, the sun don’t rain all the time
There’s gonna be some heartache and pain
