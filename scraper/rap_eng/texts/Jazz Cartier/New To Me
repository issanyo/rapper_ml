[Chorus]
I'm counting my money and putting on all of my jewelry
My coat is chinchilla and rabbit give a fuck about cruelty
I don't got time for you niggas and all of your foolery
When you see me out I'm wilding out man it's all new to me
It's all new to me
And everybody said this time last year I'd be right here
But now it's on
Man it's all new to me, it's all new to me
And everybody saying this time last year I'd be right here
But now it's on man it's all new to me

[Verse 1]
Skate through traffic
Mason Raymond, no chasing pavements
I got 5 chains on, no enslavement my nigga no explaining
I'm doing donuts while getting danish, dont tell my agent
I'm having brunch while discussing these Francis Bacon paintings
Budget problems see shit nobody got, I fucking cop
Its Cartier, no I figured out why broke niggas watch
How you fuck your credit up, all you do is window shop
I'm ballin now, like I'm Busta Rhymes back when he cut his locs
We ain't fucking with your catalogue
And I never buy clothes out of catalogues
Niggas like birds, they can go and get they parrot on
How you skip leg day tryna run a marathon, look
La Fleur with the stone like Eragon
My shit do 360, paragon
Wake up and bathe, up in Dom PÃ©rignon
All I see is signs like M. Night Shyamalan

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I just been back on my business
Wasting no time and I cherish my minutes
I'm treating the game like I'm treating my bitches
You niggas can have em whenever I'm finished
Look in the mirror, my vision exquisite
I sleep with the wicked, and dig em in divots
The one with the bat you ain't hitting my wicket
Ain't nobody go to your shows you only performing for crickets
Its the golden child and I just hatched up out a fucking egg
Gave you niggas time to rest I'm coming for your fucking head
Ain't your mama tell you when you wake up make your fucking bed
I can't fall for pussy cause that money make me cum instead
Shits crazy how you hoes gonna act now
Used to play a nigga in the background
Now I'm getting paid to be the fucking main act now
Pussy used to run now it's falling in my lap now
I plant my seeds in '93
From hide and seek
To knocking teeth
To riding beats
Do not compete
And, any niggas after me from here on out is obsolete, Jacuzzi
