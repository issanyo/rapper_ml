[Intro]
They always forget you until they remember they need some
I got that crack, that's that shit that make all of these fiends run
Take a dab with your finger, I guarantee it make your teeth numb
But just a reminder that you didn't climb the four favors cause you never need one
Every nigga trying to one-up Jazz, I ain't never tripping
I learn from my mistakes, being dolo on vogue, I ain't never slipping
I heard you got a tape coming out, that's cute, I would never listen
A bunch of internet stars can't see, they eyes glued to the television

[Verse 1]
Live and direct, live and direct
Fuck is this shit? Knife at your neck
Please do not move, please do not move
I'm on the track, fuck you expect?
Silent assassin
My demons too violent to manage
I'm driving no license on Rory and Ivan, I guess I'm too crazy to manage (who the fuck are you?)
I am Lafleur, compare me to what
I came to reign, tear niggas up
I'm at the edge of the building, I swear I been losing my mind
Dare me to jump
Dare me to jump
Dare me to jump
Y'all must have thought I was scared of you punks
Tie up his body, meet in the lobby
Watch how you niggas get scared in a drought
Fuck around and see a catfish kidnap
Niggas lookin' all scared like I did that
I'm lookin' back like "yeah boy, I did that"
You keep talkin' and its finna be a mismatch
(don't do that Cuzzi, relax)
Enter my world, pardon my mess
Blow all around, scars on my chest
Money and music insistin' my debt
And if you see them boys, you resist the arrest
Bring the rice out, take my knife out
Get my clap on, and then it's lights out
(I'm gonna fucking jump, I wanna fucking jump, I swear to God. Nah, get it together, get it together. You can't fuck this up, you can't fuck this up. Rarrr!)

*Beat Switch*

I told niggas I pop and they bench slept
I can never be six God, I am the sixth sense
Bearin' more weight than a nigga can bench press
I planted my seeds, now all y'all been stressed
If life's a bitch, than I finger fuck it
You niggas want it with Cuzzi, man I can press the button
I'm the prince of the city, I know the pressures comin'
And there can only be one, and I'm next to nothin'
Shit, how did we come to this?
The same kid who partied on Queen, is now runnin' shit
I'm finna shut shit down, like y'all Guvernment
And if you dappin' me nigga, wear oven mitts
Shit, no more funny business
Your opinion is litter, I'm not fuckin' with it
Y'all hittin' up Lantz, you not fuckin' with him
You hear this beat my nigga? You not fuckin' with him

*Beat Switch*

Don't play us out, that's my brother, and he raised himself
His momma went as a kid
Put himself in his basement until he mastered his shit
Nobody handed him nothing, he never asked them for shit
He ain't ever left the city, never been on a plane
But the moment that this drop, a lot of that shit gon' change
I'd be lyin' if I said that "our shit don't stink"
Play this shit up at my funeral, that shit gon' bang
I got two lil brothers, and a sister that I barely see
Thinkin': if I die, I'mma leave em' with my legacy
My step dad is ten times the man I'll ever be
I put him through some shit, that I probably shouldn't dare repeat
Whoever wanted me dead, failed terribly
This paranoia shit's no joke, I need therapy
You niggas easy to come by, I'm a rarity
I'm on my Jay Z shit, moment of clarity

*Beat Switch*

Told the world that they can't stop me
Watch how I do it, but understand they can't top me (nah nigga)
Watch me get cocky, I'm next at bat, hit it home like big Papi
A man of many suits, I only bare the truth
I'm the General nigga, and I got many troops
And when I walk in the building, you know they all salute
(yeah, shit)
People all spreading rumours instead of spreading love
They not around when you down
Now I'm the kid with the crown
Now I'm the talk of the town
Yeah, I'm in a sick dream
I don't know what this shit means
But by the end of 2016
Niggas gotta pay 20 if they need a 16
