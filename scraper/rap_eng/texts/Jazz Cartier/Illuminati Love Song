[Hook]
She said her name's Illuminati (Pleasure meeting you)
She wants my mind and wants my body (I can't give her two)
One kiss will turn me to a zombie (Girl I'm feeling you)
But I can't let her get it out me (Oh no)
I can't let her get it out me
Tell me, have you ever danced with the devil babe?
Tell me, have you ever danced with the devil babe?
Tell me, have you ever danced with the devil babe?
Tell me, have you ever danced with the devil babe?
She said her name's Illuminati

[Verse 1]
Murder she wrote
Man, she loves taking control
There's something about her that nobody knows
Give her the rope
Wake up with it around your throat
She looks so good in that gold
She looks so good in that coat
She told me she wants my mind
But I cannot give her my soul, no
It's a quarter after midnight
Dancing in the dim light
Shit you're saying feels right
And I heard about your past
I heard it and I laughed
And it takes two to tango
So I offered you my hand

I can't let her get it out me

Tell me, have you ever danced with the devil babe?
Tell me, have you ever danced with the devil babe?
Tell me, have you ever danced with the devil babe?

[Verse 2]
She got an ex named Mason
Now she is free and ain't need no replacement
Ring on her finger, called off engagements
Hot with cold feet, her mind was impatient
She jets off, I gazed in amazement
Blood orange sun my heart holds relation
Poison my veins and subdue the patient
She gets away the story so ancient
Bad habit after bad habit
I try to quit, but I'm bad at it
Her tattoo is like backgammon
If I stay tonight, my whole life will be mad lavish

[Pre-Hook]
Everything you fantasize
You just had to sacrifice
Promise you'll be sanctified

She said her name's Illuminati
She wants my mind and wants my body
One kiss will turn me to a zombie
But I can't let her get it out me
I can't let her get it out me
