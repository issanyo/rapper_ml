[Intro]
I struggle with God so much
Because I can't forgive myself and I don't really want to right now
I can live with it but I can't forgive myself
And sometimes, I don't want to believe in a God that couldn't forgive me
But I do, when I'm sober

[Verse 1]
I've been trying to take control of what I'm doing, but I lost it
Lately, I don't know what I've been doing, have I lost it?
The high is almost over, just relax and keep composure
Add some liquor to your liver, smoke a cigarette for closure
Uh-Huh
Have you ever felt alone in your skin?
Cause y'all wanna feel lonely again
Have you ever felt alone in your skin?
Cause y'all wanna feel lonely again
Cause you know that I've been

[Hook]
In and out of space, In and out of space
Losing all my faith, Losing all my faith
Lost without a trace, Lost without a trace
Bearing all this weight, Bearing all this weight
No I can't feel nothing (Yeah)
Just can't feel nothing (Yeye)
I just wanna feel something (Yeah)
(This is how it's supposed to be)
No I can't feel nothing, ain't no need to take another hit
Cause I can't feel nothing
(This is how it's supposed to be)
(This is how it's supposed to be)

[Verse 2]
Drown in silence, cause I don't like talking much
Follow me into the darkness, shit, we'll get lost and such
You ain't even that high but you still trippin'
It's second nature to a nigga like me, but you made a routine
So baby girl you gotta live with it
Let me ask you this son
Have you ever felt alone in your skin?
Cause y'all wanna feel lonely again
Have you ever felt alone in your skin?
Cause y'all wanna feel lonely again
Cause you know that I've been

[Hook]
In and out of space, In and out of space
Losing all my faith, Losing all my faith
Lost without a trace, Lost without a trace
Bearing all this weight, Bearing all this weight
No I can't feel nothing (Yeah)
Just can't feel nothing (Yeye)
I just wanna feel something (Yeah)
(This is how it's supposed to be)
No I can't feel nothing, ain't no need to take another hit
Cause I can't feel nothing

No I can't feel nothing (Yeah)
Just can't feel nothing (Yeye)
I just wanna feel something (Yeah)
(This is how it's supposed to be)
No I can't feel nothing, ain't no need to take another hit
Cause I can't feel nothing
(This is how it's supposed to be)
(This is how it's supposed to be)
(This is how it's supposed to be)
(This is how it's supposed to be)

You ever feel alone in your skin
You wanna feel lonely again
You talk, but I don't listen
Cause baby I don't feel it
