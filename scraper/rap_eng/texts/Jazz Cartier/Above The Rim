[Hook: Sean Leon]
Imma call the shots
Til I call it quits
Ball above the rim (yeah)
Balling once again (yeah)
Jumpin out the...(wooo)
Jumping out the gym
Jumping out the gym yeah I'm jumping out the gym
Balling once again
Balling with my friends
Bumping in my ends
They love me in the end
Jumping out the.....(wooo)
Jumping out the gym
Jumping out the gym yeah I'm jumping out the gym

[Verse 1: Jazz Cartier]
Look, I'm a great one
I've been on point since day one
I stay on the ball
Back on the wall
If I get hit with a charge then I play dumb (what)
I know the ropes
I take my steps
I break the rules
You break a sweat
You take a shot
And take the tech
I'm like the mob
I pay the refs (pay up)
Don't shoot the messenger
I do not fuck with no replica
I walk and I fuck up the temperature
I move on the court like I'm Federer
All of that talk and I'm burly
I'm killing the game like I'm Curry
Now you on fire
Before you retire, they gotta retire your jersey

[Bridge: Jazz Cartier]
Balling with my chain like I'm Master P in '99
I'm just running game
I am never running out of time
Always on my grind
You just do this shit from time to time
Million dollar baby but they see me as a dollar sign

[Hook: Sean Leon]
Imma call the shots
Til I call it quits
Ball above the rim (yeah)
Balling once again (yeah)
Jumpin out the...(wooo)
Jumping out the gym
Jumping out the gym yeah I'm jumping out the gym
Balling once again
Balling with my friends
Bumping in my ends
They love me in the end
Jumping out the.....(wooo)
Jumping out the gym
Jumping out the gym yeah I'm jumping out the gym

[Verse 2: Sean Leon]
Nah I ain't forget
All the times they held me back and held me down
I'm counting stacks to boost my stats
I hired a staff to help me out
I'm thinking like an athlete, tryna boosts stat sheets, yeah
I got it bumping, acne, you got a problem, @ me, yeah
I've been nice since Corey Joe
Got it popping back East
These are facts
These are facts
These are facts
These are facts
Might just off your head you know
Might just offer rap attacks
Toronto rap All-Stars
All facts, they're all saw it, yeah
As far as the women go, It was a give and go
I run the play like I'm Stockton and my dog was Karl Malone
When I hit the strip, I like to pick and roll (wooo)
When we in the whip, I let my finger roll
Dropped out of Seneca College
Flipping American checks
I got a hundred connects
J for my plug from the West
I got the ball boy
You washed up
I pop up, you starstruck
The Michael B. Jordan of Rap
I'm not a boy, I'm a man
When will you boys understand
Black Sheep Nirvana, my band
I need me a hundred a jam
They need me a hundred on hundred
I need you to run up my money again
Jumping out the gym
And when I'm done with the contact
Labels be maxing the contracts

[Outro: Sean Leon]
Jumping out the gym
Jumping out the gym
Ball above the rim
Balling once again
Yeah
Ball above the...rim
Jumping out the gym
