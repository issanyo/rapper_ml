[Verse 1]
Uhm, she said Jazz, don't lie to me
I know so many guys who've lied to me
I know the game, you don't even got to try with me
So stop playing, you don't got to run lies with me
But I know, you're still living in your past
Promises that's sure to last
One too many one-night stands
But that don't apply with me
Come on, take your time with me
You like to pass judgement on how I live
Talking 'bout all the girls who you think are hoes that you see in my crib
But you're here too, so tell me what that makes you?
If I'm fake, then you're fake, too
But we both know they don't make 'em like me
And you've been tryna make due
You're so melodic, this shit is so platonic
They told you stay away, you heard that from everybody, everybody
I'm gonna lose in time, I'm gonna lose in time
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my mind, I'm gonna lose my mind
Searching for ya!
You believe too much
You've been caught up in the scene too much
Seen the pics from the club, and you sing too much
It's the part of your life where your dreams lose touch
And you don't even know it so have control
It's a part of your life you don't have to show
Seen so many girls, they pass and go
You already know what I'm asking for
What I'm asking for

[Hook: DCF]
I see you standing in line, why you wasting your time?
I just know how it goes, I don't want you to change
I'm racing with time, steady tryna rewind
I just know how it goes, I don't want you to change, you to change
She said I'm always up to something, uh uh
Always up to something
She said I'm always up to something, uh uh

[Verse 2]
Uhm, I'm not perfect, all this stress is not worth it
You want the love that I'm serving
Been drifted away and resurfaced, baby we work it
You know I've been tripping, having people in my business
With these girls who like commitment, but you promised you'll be different
Babe, you just begged for me, I just begged to leave
Can't we just agree? This ain't meant for me!
We should take it slow, sip that Texas tea
I ain't running games, you no referee
What's on your agenda? The ex club you can go and be a member
I won't succumb, and you won't surrender, yous a pretender
Say your goodbyes, I'm gone 'till November
You wasn't keeping me grounded
There ain't no getting around it
You cannot keep me at flow, I'm in a room full of smoke
Reason my vision is clouded, baby
I'm gonna lose in time, I'm gonna lose in time
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my mind, I'm gonna lose my mind
Searching for ya!
What happened to the dreams you've had?
What happened to the means you've had?
Thoughts that you think you had
But now it don't seem too bad
But now I don't need you back
I'm telling you to have control
It's a part of your life you don't have to show
Seen so many girls, they pass and go
You already know what I'm asking for
What I'm asking for
