[verse 1]

Why every weekend the fiends hit me up and they blow down my cellular
Word on the road i’m the man in my city but don’t shoot the messenger
Bitches be flocking Jacuzzi at parties as soon as I step in there
Come to the Palace, but don’t be a stranger your girlfriends a regular
Niggas been hating since back in the day
Please do not think that you bitches is safe
New to my city but don’t let it fool you, you fuck the wrong nigga you will be replaced
Pussy is pussy, no need for the chase
Fuck all you niggas, you niggas is waste
Why do you niggas love riding my wave
Man, its still Get Home Safe ain't no need to explain

[hook]

‘Cause we been on that
Yeah my whole clique been on that
Yeah we been on that
Ya’ll still on that
God damn my cities been on that

(Jacuzzi!)

I don’t give a fuck, my clique deep nigga
And we ain't fucking with you, see you in the street nigga x2

[verse 2]

See the thing with you broke niggas
You always wanna tell me your problems
Shit nigga, I ain't really rich myself but keep it to yourself that ain't really my problem
The only reason niggas love bitches, is cause niggas love drama
Same niggas talking bout they fucking everybody be the same waste niggas who ain't never got condoms
Damn, Jazzy why you get em like that
It ain't nothing to me nigga I just got it like that
Blowing money fast cause I got it like that
Took a hit last week and I got it right back
I just do it, this shits nothing
I think I may have over slept but i’m still stuntin
I put the bullshit to rest, cause i’m 1up’n
I got the city on my back ya’ll ain't on nothin
