[Verse 1]
Where should I start? Where should I start?
The brain, or the heart?
Which ever I chose, don’t cancel em out, cause ill take em apart (yeah)
Now niggas wanna dress like me? (Interesting)
A year ago, yall had waves,  now niggas growing dreads like me? Just like me (woo!)
Start up the verse then I pray for the worst
Then I body the track, cause you boys getting murked
Work, I am Jacuzzi the villian
Hide all the women and children
You boys feelings froggy than ribbit
Ya’ll been the cavity, I am the filling
I’m running this race, hand me my ribbon
(ah, ah, flexin' on em' niggas, ah)

[Verse 2]
I pop me a xanni’ if she got a kid then I hire a nanny
I been in the stu’ getting fatty
I’m just trying to get me a Grammy
My bitch a baddy
And your bitch a cattie
She blinded whenever she see me she know that Im flashy
(flash)
I’m making a trip out to Cali, Jacuzzi got hoes in The Valley
I’m the king of the court, but don’t play me no games, i ain't tryna rally
The money keep coming
She coming, I’m counting
And I’m losing tally
Went from eating them patties in alleys
Now I’m having dinner in Paris

[Outro]
Aiyiyi Aiyiyi
I think about you every night
Aiyiyi Aiyiyi
I think about you every night
I said that I’d write you a song, but I wrote you a ballad
You said that you paint me a picture, but you burning holes in the canvas
I said that I’d write you a song, but I wrote you a ballad
You said that you paint me a picture, but you burning holes in the canvas
I won’t get the life that I wanted
I won’t get the life that I wanted
Cause I fell in love with a women
The Valley
I live in The Valley
Maraud in The Valley
Turning to God in The Valley
I hope I don’t die in The Valley, The Valley
No, no, no, no, don’t go
Winters coming
Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t go
I need you now
Who do you believe in now?
What is your religion now?
Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t go
