Part One: One Day

[Intro]
You know I wanna get out
You know I wanna get out

[Verse 1]
Let me look into your soul, I just want to feel whole
I don't want to hear "no"
I'm so sick of all these hoes, sick of all them rolls
I just wanted you to know
I'm leaving tonight, got a ticket for two
Fuck a bag cause the only thing missing is you
Got a driver that's cool
Escape to an island of flutes
Dance in a field of delilah's so we can watch movies in silence
Stare in your eyes and admire or talk about how we both in love with violence
Broke this thing down to a science
You want my attention, well it's undivided
Whatever you want, you got it
I promise girl, I won't divide it
I love when you come out of pocket
If you want the world, then you got it
(but I told you)

[Pre Hook] (x2)
You know I wanna get out
I'll let you, let you get out

[Hook]
One day you gon' see
One day you gon' see
For now I'll let you stunt on me, I'll let you stunt on me
Yeah, you know
One day you gon' see
One day you gon' see
For now I'll let you stunt on me, I'll let you stunt on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Walking on colorful palettes, walking on colorful palettes (beautiful)
I may have took you for granted, I may have took you for granted (as usual)
I wasn't born in this world, I'm from a whole 'nother planet (from a UFO)
You told me: bury my pride, so we can bury the hatchet
I don't understand it, why you so concerned with your status?
You ain't Serena, stop making a racket
See I was just taking control, you were just taking advantage
You started blaming the world, cause you put your eggs in one basket
Then when your eggs started hatching, you're looking around like "what happened?"
(but I told you)

[Pre Hook] (x2)
You know I wanna get out
I'll let you, let you get out

[Hook] (x2)
One day you gon' see
One day you gon' see
For now I'll let you stunt on me, I'll let you stunt on me
Yeah, you know
One day you gon' see
One day you gon' see
For now I'll let you stunt on me, I'll let you stunt on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro] (x2)
You know I won't forget us
I'll let you, let you get out

Part Two: Feel Away

[Hook]
I know that you feel away
I know that you feel away
You know that I've been away
I know some feelings have changed
I know that you feel away
I know that you feel away
I am no stranger to pain
I hope you catch that bouquet

[Verse 1]
A lot of shit been gettin' crazy on me
A lot of people goin' crazy on me
The time's now, I gotta seize the moment
And everyday, I'm getting closer to my dreams
I gotta take one for the team, so how bad do you really want it?
I'm in a Uber, home takin' the long way
A backwoods gonna put an end to a long day
Like, I'm tryna talk to you
But you always tryna argue
Cuz you read my texts the wrong way
Look, I'm having dinner in the Hamptons
Thinking bout getting a mansion
The table next to me, talkin' bout expansions
I'm just tryna make it happen
Cuz I'm a long way from Kansas, look it all my flaws
Look at all of yours
Girl you played yourself, now you want that pause
Now your boys on tour, but don't hold your applause

[Hook]
I know that you feel away
I know that you feel away
You know that I've been away
I know some feelings have changed
I know that you feel away
I know that you feel away
I am no stranger to pain
I hope you catch that bouquet

[Outro] (x3)
I know, you know
