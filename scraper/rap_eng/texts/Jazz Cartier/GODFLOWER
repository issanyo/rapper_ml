[Intro]
L-l-let’s go

[Verse 1]
La Fleur comin’ from the ground, look at what we found
Now is not the time, nigga, I can’t fuck around, nah
Flowers in my crown, lettin’ off every round
Now they wanna count favours when they used to count me out
Big bodies pullin’ up, now they look me up
What you want from me?
Now you wanna talk to me, want everything and all of me
Demons in my head, they go red, yeah, they hauntin’ me
Bitches in my bed, in my head, yeah, they hauntin’ me, I know
Recognize
I been rollin’ with the punches, Dana White
You in disguise, all your friends tellin’ lies
It’s no surprise, go ahead and switch sides
I pick the dice up, and put my price up
When we out of town, bet they recognize us
My nigga cuckoo with them clippers, get you lined up
It’s petal garden, they don't make nobody like us

[Chorus]
I’m the big dippa
Cartier don’t got no time for no bitch nigga
Pain heavy on the brain, so I sip liquor
When I was broke, used to dream like a rich nigga
Ribs touchin’ from the days I used to miss dinner
Ex beggin’ for me back, but I don’t miss her
If she pop it on the pole, then I’m gon’ tip her
Even when I took a L, I came out the winner
I got better while everybody just-

[Verse 2]
Oh nah, this pockets broke, got fixed (yes)
Cup so dirty, I could never pass a piss (test)
Bad redbone, I’m just tryna get a grips (yes)
Fenty on her lips, bumpin’ Riri in the whip
I could get you anything you want for the right price
The weed help me go to sleep, fuck a night light
I’m the only bad boy they let up in Nice Guy
The moon, baby, I was born into the night life

[Bridge]
I got everything to lose
Molly got me howlin’ to the moon
Take a hit, I bet it change your mood
Never been the type to follow rules
If you love me, then you’ll take it to the tomb
Tool, grind, used to wake up with my account in the minus
Put that on my momma, that shit kept a nigga grindin’
Applyin’ all pressure, make diamonds

[Chorus]
I’m the big dipper
Cartier don’t got no time for no bitch nigga
Pain heavy on the brain, so I sip liquor
When I was broke, used to dream like a rich nigga
Ribs touchin’ from the days I used to miss dinner
Ex beggin’ for me back, but I don’t miss her
If she pop it on the pole, then I’m gon’ tip her
Even when I took a L, I came out the winner
I got better while everybody just got bitter
