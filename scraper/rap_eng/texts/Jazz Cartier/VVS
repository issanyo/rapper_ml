[Intro: Jazz Cartier]
Wow, VVS, diamonds dancin' on my neck
Jazz, KTOE

[Verse 1: Jazz Cartier]
VV, see me, flashy
Money press, no khaki, I can't roll with lacky
Money pop like matadors, see red like Cincinnati
And my hair stay nappy like that boy from Tallahassee, yeah
Shawty always stressin', 10 bands in a nightstand
She so new to the night life, doin' lines in the iPad
Ooh, shit, my bad, ooh shit, my bad
I put a M on my price tag, I drove in [?] like a [?]
She was in love from the moment she see me, but she had her head in the clouds
She knew I was different, I'm not like them niggas, but she couldn't figure me out
Still tryna figure me out, I'm tryna get all my figures
They never noticed when diamonds was missin', but now that I got it, they treatin' me different

[Pre-Chorus: Jazz Cartier]
She turn the stroker on whenever I got the cameras on
Can't get a handle on her, I let her ride on my handle bars
Bare skin in the fur, do anything for La Fleur
Hickies on my neck, VVSs on my chest

[Chorus: KTOE]
Baby, you know you love these, VVS
Diamonds dancin' on my neck
Baby, you know you love these, VVS
Diamonds dancin' on my neck
Baby, you know you love these, VVS
Diamonds dancin' on my neck
Baby, you know you love these, VVS
Diamonds dancin' on my neck
Baby, you know you love 'em

[Verse 2: Jazz Cartier]
Yeah, momma said I gotta keep it humble, Jaguar creepin' through the jungle
No reset, can't undo (woo), look, look, look, what we come to
Off top, let me stop, I need banks like 50 got
I need 50 for the ride, the F50, ride it stock
I harmonize, I keep 'em tough, put it down and heat 'em up
This a body, I beat it up, niggas talk but not speakin' up
And my bitch is a diva, screamin' Ave Maria
And she look like Aaliyah, ridin' foreigns, no Visa

[Pre-Chorus: Jazz Cartier]
She turn the stroker on whenever I got the cameras on
Can't get a handle on her, I let her ride on my handle bars
Bare skin in the fur, do anything for La Fleur
Hickies on my neck, VVSs on my chest

[Chorus: KTOE]
Baby, you know you love these, VVS
Diamonds dancin' on my neck
Baby, you know you love these, VVS
Diamonds dancin' on my neck
Baby, you know you love these, VVS
Diamonds dancin' on my neck
Baby, you know you love these, VVS
Diamonds dancin' on my neck
Baby, you know you love 'em
