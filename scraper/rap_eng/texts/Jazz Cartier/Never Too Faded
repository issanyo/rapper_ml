[Intro]
She said Jacuzzi you wasted
She said Jacuzzi you wasted
She said Jacuzzi you wasted

[Hook]
I'm never too faded
I'm never too faded
Look at my eyes
I'm never too wasted
I'm never too wasted
I'm a disguise
You cannot trace me
You cannot trace me
I'm never too faded, never too faded
I'm never too faded, boy I'm never too faded

[Verse 1]
I'm never too faded
Look at my eyes
I'm high off a molly feel like I'm in Vegas
I gave her that D
Baby, I'm so tenacious
I don't fuck with thotties, I don't fuck with basics
My swagger is flagrant
I walk in the party, I feel like I'm famous
But I'll never be jaded
I know I been quiet, I'm back of hiatus
(Don't do that Cuzzi, relax)
I took off the summer, you fell on your faces
(Don't do that Cuzzi, relax)
A lot of you niggas been testing my patience (Stop it)
Me I don't rate it (Stop it)
My dealer is Haitian (Stop that shit)
Baby fuck a relation, let's get acquainted

[Hook]
I'm never too faded
I'm never too faded
Look at my eyes
I'm never too wasted
I'm never too wasted
I'm a disguise
You cannot trace me
You cannot trace me
I'm never too faded, never too faded
I'm never too faded, boy I'm never too faded

[Verse 2]
I'm never too faded
Look at the sky
When you mention my city, I'm one of the greatest
I know when I say this, lot of niggas gone hate it
I got a prescription, but I ain't a patient
Call my plug on the daily
She forcing the high, I said baby be patient
You go know when it hits you
I Pour up a cup
But you know I don't chase it
Love the red, love the yellows and browns
Girl, my dick isn't racist , I love all kinds of faces
When I pull up to the spot
Gotta keep it on the low
Know the feds is on the watch
They don't wanna see me glow
I'm not new to this, baby
I don't do this shit for show
If you passing and she Haitian then you know if you could roll

[Pre-Hook]
I got my face missing
Pain dripping, Nigga
Lane switching
Quit with all the questions
Cause the answer's easy, niggas know I'm-

[Hook]
I'm never too faded
I'm never too faded
Look at my eyes
I'm never too wasted
I'm never too wasted
I'm a disguise
You cannot trace me
You cannot trace me
I'm never too faded, never too faded
I'm never too faded, boy I'm never too faded

[Bridge]
I'm so in love with the plug
I'm so in love with the plug
Thanking me all of my drug
Thanking me all of my drug
I'm so in love with the plug
I'm so in love with the plug
Thanking me all of my drug
I'm so in love with the plug

[Hook]
I'm never too faded
I'm never too faded
Look at my eyes

I'm never too wasted
I'm a disguise
You cannot trace me
You cannot trace me
I'm never too faded, never too faded
I'm never too faded, boy I'm never too faded
