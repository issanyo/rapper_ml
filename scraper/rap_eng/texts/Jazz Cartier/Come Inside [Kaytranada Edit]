[Chorus: Lou Phelps]
Hey, baby, is you down to ride?
Knocking at your front door let me come inside
Knocking at your front door let me come inside
Can you let a brotha know if you down to ride uh
Hey baby is you down to ride?
Knocking at your front door let me come inside
Knocking at your front door let me come inside
Can you let a brotha know if you down to ride uh, uh

[Verse 1: Lou Phelps]
Had my eyes on you for a minute
Didn't take a chance at love broken hearted
Talk about love baby, use your logic
Wanna I say the truth, fuck it, go 'head up out it
Sitting by my window staring at the moonlight uh
Call my baby up tryna get the mood right uh
Met her at the strip club she was a freelancer
Told her to give me her sign
She was a Cancer
Dancing for them dollars at the damn club
Stripping for these niggas that we wouldn't even dare touch
She knows I ain't tripping over damn thugs
She was that mama bear, I was her damn cub
Cause I was her baby, oh shit she must've done have about eighty
Just a young nigga from Haiti
All these niggas hating on a nigga getting wealthy
Savory like mustard
Baby I want the cake, let me get that custard
I wanna give it to you like American Pie
And if she let me ain't nobody can touch her uh, uh, uh
Shit ain't changed maybe except for the chains
And the diamond rings
Can't forget the fact I bought the new name
I'm the pharmacist baby get this vitamin
Damn!

[Chorus: Lou Phelps]
Hey baby, is you down to ride?
Knocking at your front door, let me come inside
Knocking at your front door, let me come inside
Can you let a brotha know if you down to ride, uh
Hey baby, is you down to ride?
Knocking at your front door, let me come inside
Knocking at your front door, let me come inside
Can you let a brotha know if you down to ride, uh

[Verse 2: Jazz Cartier]
Yeah, I wonder if it's way too much
Tell me if I'm weighing you down
I'm here waiting around
I can always see your face in the crowd
You know I love you can't say it aloud
I wanna wait up for you and wake up to you
Had to make that Clair, like a Huxtable
You re-juxtaposes, it so I fuck with you
And even though it gets sappy I can't get enough of you
So come and take a ride on my jet pack
You never react to little mishaps
And even though we can't look back
Most couldn't catch a break if you threw 'em all kit kats
It's so common
I'm standing on your lawn with this big ass sign like coming
If you stand tall, nigga, fall for the slightest
And trust me you don't wanna fight it
Open it up

[Chorus x2: Lou Phelps]
Hey baby is you down to ride? (yah, oo, yah)
Knocking at your front door let me come inside
Knocking at your front door let me come inside
Can you let a brotha know if you down to ride uh (ay, uh)

[Bridge: Lou Phelps]
Ay, let me move to the left (to the left)
Break it down baby feel yourself uh, uh (feel yourself)
Feeling on your chest get wet uh (get wet, get wet)
Show these bitches I'll shake my dick (oh, shake my dick)
Jingle jangle jangle
Baby let me hit it in different angles (oh what)
Give me that one-two step (yah)
Stop, nah, baby I ain't done yet ( uh, yah, ay)
Let me get another round get down (get down)
Imma give you that champion sound (ay, ay, that sound)
Got me feeling like Rick James uh (wow, Rick James)
Super freak when I'm in your town yeah (when I'm in your town)
Haters I flip the bird uh (go Lou, go Lou)
I got the juice so nigga I ain't scared (go Lou, go Lou)
Keep the sneaks set that's my word (go Lou, go Lou)
Go 'head and pass me some of that fly herb yeah (pass that)

[Outro: Lou Phelps]
Hey baby, is you down to ride?
Knocking at your front door let me come inside
Knocking at your front door let me come inside
Can you let a brotha know if you down to ride, uh
Hey baby, is you down to ride?
Knocking at your front door let me come inside
Knocking at your front door let me come inside
