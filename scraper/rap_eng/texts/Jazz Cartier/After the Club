[Hook] (2x)
Call me after the club
Call me, call me up
I love you when you're drunk
So baby tell me what's up

[Verse 1]
I'm still the king of the palace
Two thousand and fifteen was practice
You niggas ain't even established
That's why she don't fuck with no rappers
She said it's my song, oh girl this my song
Grab a drink and hit the floor soon as that Cuzzi coming on
Got a shorty from NY, got a shorty from Milan
They take their clothes off at the door
Pour some more, we get it on, like what's up

[Hook] (2x)
Call me after the club
Call me, call me up
I love you when you're drunk
So baby tell me what's up

[Verse 2]
Shout out my girls in the valley
Credit cards them they daddies
When I come to your city baby, tell me you 'bout it
She said 'that's my shit'
Oh yeah, that's my shit
She throws her guns up in the air
Now you know that girl is lit
Got a girl in MIA
Got a shorty in L.A
Love the fucking, hate to leave em'
But I do this every day
So what's up

[Hook] (2x)
Call me after the club
Call me, call me up
I love you when you're drunk
So baby tell me what's up
