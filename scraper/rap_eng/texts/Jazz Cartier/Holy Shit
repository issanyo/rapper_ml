Holy shit! Woo!
Holy shit! Woo!
Holy shit! Woo!
Holy shit! Woo!

[Verse 1]
Who they be checking for, dawg
Look at the stats and my repertoire, dawg
One phone call, I'll be at your front door with the whole fucking cast from the Reservoir Dogs
Ughhh, 'Cuzzi the king of the jungle (holy shit!)
I pick up the brick when you fumble
Now who the fuck gonna stop me, new Kamikaze
Whipping in the 'Saki, cocky
Notice you niggas been being defiant
Forgot I'm a giant my nigga, like Jeremy Shockey (woo!)
Your girl is my personal servant (hold my shit!)
But she is not getting no service
'Cuzzi

[Hook]
Holy shit! Woo!
Holy shit! Woo!
Holy shit! Woo!
Holy shit! Woo!

[Verse 2]
The golden child's back in this bitch
Lantz layed the pad and I tackle the shit
All my hoes, they play scrabble and strip
Have them showroom orgies, they can raffle my kids
But dont wear no panties 'round 'Cuzzi (hold my kids!)
My bitch is Italy, she go tell her daddy she fucking a moulie
If I don't make a milli off this rapping shit, I'm hitting licks
It's only me and Lantz so we just do that 50/50 split
All that extra bullshit y'all be talking, y'all can miss me with
My pants forever sag, so all these hoes can see me hold my dick
'Cuzzi bitch

[Hook]
Holy shit! Woo!
Holy shit! Woo!
Holy shit! Woo!
Holy shit! Woo!

[Outro]
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Holy shit!
Holy shit!
Woo!
Holy shit!
Woo!
