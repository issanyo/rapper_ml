[Verse 1]
I never ball in the club
I am the fly on the wall
Duck in the tub
She's never falling in love
I live for the rush, can't have enough
Money, pussy, power, all the above
I just want some head, she wants to fuck
Hands on the wall, don't press your luck
Tell me your lies, fool me with lust
Couldn't settle down with nothing less than a freak
Big booty girls, big booty girls
Your body's a poisonous bliss in the world
I don't shuck and jive, easy on the pearl
Tell me to pretend and I promise that I'll play along
T a nigga down, make you come if you been waiting long
Easy on the stick, crush that pussy while I'm playing on
I felt for your ways, but I promise you won't take this

[Pre-Hook]
Take my breath away, take my breath away
Take my breath away, take my breath away
Lately I've been, tryna take control
Sweat be dripping down your body
While you dancing on the pole

[Hook] (x2)
So don't tell, me the truth, it feels better when you lie
So don't tell, me the truth, it feels better when you lie
So don't tell, me the truth, it feels better when you lie to me
Come lie to me
But don't tell me the truth

[Verse 2]
How you look so good in the summer?
I'm not tryna blow your cover
I'm just tryna get your number
So I can get you in the covers
Touch down and your whole squad done up
I'm just tryna hit it to the sun up
My skin on your skin is like butter
And if that pussy real good, I might stu- stu- stu- stu- stutter
Man, shout out to my girls getting melanin
Would you be interested in telling me your regiment?
After party at my crib, go and tell a friend
I know your type and this really ain't your element
Love sick, girl you looking like my medicine
I'll even let you cum first, what a gentleman
It's JLF, they should be like the president
But I like Jacksons, Gregs and Benjamins
Oh lord

[Pre-Hook]
Take my breath away, take my breath away
Take my breath away, take my breath away
Lately I've been, tryna take control
I'm swiping, checking, I can body
Why you dissing on the phone?

[Hook] (2x)
So don't tell, me the truth, it feels better when you lie
So don't tell, me the truth, it feels better when you lie
So don't tell, me the truth, it feels better when you lie to me
Come lie to me
But don't tell me the truth

[Outro] (2x)
So don't tell, me the truth, it feels better when you lie
So don't tell, me the truth, it feels better when you lie
So don't tell, me the truth, it feels better when you lie to me
Come lie to me
But don't tell me the truth
