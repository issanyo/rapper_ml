[Chorus]
She look up and see the gliss (she look up and see the gliss)
Saw my chain and made a wish (saw my chain and made a wish)
All I wanted was the money (all I wanted was the money)
Who would've thought this made me rich?

[Verse 1]
Who would've thought it made me rich?
All that hate it make me sick
Ever since I was a teen they leave me inside of it
Roll around in stolen whips
Never go against the clip, let me remind 'em
Tryna steal the wave, we gon' drown 'em like Poseidon
Ridin' every winter just to vacate on an island
Careful when the Henny's 'round my niggas, they be wylin'
Just be silent
That's okay, what you sellin' we ain't buyin'
You expired
She give me head on a Ski-Doo (yeah)
She fell in love with my needles
Screamin' out "please, please, let it be"
Like a nigga in the Beatles
Top floor, I don't see you (nah)
Smoke weed, see evil
Ride around all my demons (skrr)

[Chorus]
She look up and see the gliss (she look up and see the gliss)
Saw my chain and made a wish (saw my chain and made a wish)
All I wanted was the money (all I wanted was the money)
Who would've thought this made me rich?
Ay, she look up and see the gliss (she look up and see the gliss)
When I shoot I never miss (swish)
All I wanted was the money (all I wanted was the money)
Who would've thought this made me rich?

[Verse 2]
Always lookin' forward but we gotta reminisce
You can't hang around my gang and you can't buy no membership
Where I go you see the drip
Cuzzi lit, I'm never sleep
She want all the Cartier, one on the neck, one on the wrist (yeah)
No time to be passive
New flame can't pass it
I take, no askin'
Dirty money, no napkins
She just wanna see it all, worldwide no Atlas
Put it on the first class
Came a long way from backstage pass

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
She look up and see the gliss (she look up and see the gliss)
Saw my chain and made a wish (saw my chain and made a wish)
All I wanted was the money (all I wanted was the money)
Who would've thought this made me rich?
Ay, she look up and see the gliss (she look up and see the gliss)
When I shoot I never miss (swish)
All I wanted was the money (all I wanted was the money)

[Outro]
Was it worth it?
