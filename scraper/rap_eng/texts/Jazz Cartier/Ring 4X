[Intro: Ye Ali]
Oh no, no, no, no
Yeah
Some people wanna be
No, no, no
Yeah

[Chorus: Ye Ali & Jazz Cartier]
You know it's all entertainment (yup)
Some people wanna be famous
I just keep it low, and stack this paper (I count it up)
And roll blunts with my baby, yeah
Ring, ring, ring, ring (hit me up)
Baby, I could be your private thing (brrp, brrp)
Show you things you ain't never seen (never seen)
We can keep it 'tween you and me
Ring, ring, ring, ring
(You know me and Ali go way back
You know what I'm saying, that's my brother for life)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ring, ring, ring, ring
(All the ladies will love this one)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Jazz Cartier]
Girl, will you be my Beyonce?
I'm 2 On in this party, I might call up Tinashe
I need Kendall and Kylie, Kendall and Kylie
Next time I head back to Cali let's work it out like pilates
No I don't wanna call you out, I just wanna take you down
Smoking sheesh out by the beach, that's when I burn you out
And I've been so low-low-low, on my dolo-lo-lo
He hit you up, he like is Jazz there, you like no, no, no, no
I got hundred dollar bills for all my girls in Atlanta
I know niggas in the trap who always move with the hammer
You won't catch 'em on Snap, they don't pose for no camera
I fly you out like every August 'cause you love Carabana
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I hear the ring on my phone
I hit it one time, put it down, now she won't leave me alone
I've been working overtime, baby I need me a clone
But I'm the prince of my city, I just need me a throne
Cuzzi baby, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Ye Ali]
You know it's all entertainment (yup)
Some people wanna be famous
I just keep it low, and stack this paper (I count it up)
And roll blunts with my baby, yeah
Ring, ring, ring, ring (hit me up)
Baby, I could be your private thing (brrp, brrp)
Show you things you ain't never seen (never seen)
We can keep it 'tween you and me
Ring, ring, ring, ring
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ring, ring, ring, ring
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Ye Ali]
I got a job for you 'cause you work well
When I hit your phone, don't go to voicemail
Girl I'm in the six, I'm with my nigga Jazz
He got a couple tings and they bad
Baby I just wanna see you naked
Come to the hotel room, you know my reputation
I don't really drink a lot, but you get faded
Ride on my pony, Ginuwine, I'm so anxious
Ride with me, ride with me
I need a girl to shine with me, shine with me
Girl, please don't waste my time baby, my time baby
Got a show in Vietnam baby, they calling me
Then I got a trip to France baby, a trip to France
I don't ever see my friends baby, don't get the chance
I'm in Tokyo right now but I'm back to Cali
I gotta FaceTime with you girl, you are my balance, yeah
You are my balance, you are my balance
I couldn't fuck you when I met you, girl you were a challenge
That's why I got you right here laying all on couch while I'm writing these raps
While you lay on my mattress and fix me a sandwich, I wanna tell all of my friends
That you are the best, and that's how I got you

[Chorus: Ye Ali]
You know it's all entertainment (yup)
Some people wanna be famous
I just keep it low, and stack this paper (I count it up)
And roll blunts with my baby, yeah
Ring, ring, ring, ring (hit me up)
Baby, I could be your private thing (brrp, brrp)
Show you things you ain't never seen (never seen)
We can keep it 'tween you and me
Ring, ring, ring, ring
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ring, ring, ring, ring
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
