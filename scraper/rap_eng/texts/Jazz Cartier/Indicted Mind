[Verse 1: Ken Rebel]
Niggas dick ridin', bitches dick ridin'
The youth is lost, our minds is goin'
Popped a zan now you the man
Different beat but the same song
Different right but the same wrong
Niggas think that they got it figured
Been an outcast, that's why I outlast
And then I out mass all you basic niggas
My work ethics
Would drive you hectic
Pain, tears, and blood lies in every lesson
Seen it before when it occur
Lone wolf, I watched my pack walk out the door
Just when I thought I would fall I rose like Jesus
No roses in my raps, I don't hardly need 'em
No pity parties for this poetry
I work myself so all I owe is me
I don't need niggas but it ain't vica versa
My sin devices will probably hurt ya
Mama told me all I need is God
But my prayers ain't up to par

[Hook]
The darkness in me follows me
Down the street it paints me green
The one on one, yeah that's me
They can't compete, they can never be me
The darkness in me follows me
Down the street it paints me green
The one on one, yeah that's me
They can't compete, they can never be me

[Verse 2: Jazz Cartier]
1993, JAY Z, who as hot as me?
I was countin' money while you boys was playin' hide and seek
Niggas wanna book me for a show? Pay a finder's fee
If you family fuckin' with you then you fooled 'em, we all tryna eat
I ain't fuckin' with no copycats
Got Kenny on the beat so I bodied that
All you new niggas all weirdos
If the cops come around, you the type of nigga tell 'em where the body at
Say the word and I'll test you niggas
I can't fit your ass in my schedule nigga
I'm a fuckin' god and I'll bless you niggas
Then I'll leave your ass where I left you nigga
I see 'em racin' for 'Cuzzi, them fucks don't reach in my pockets
I used to be in the club like them Rough Rider condoms
I was movin' the white outside of backhead and Honda
Shit I might bring back hypnotic for all my dogs in the projects
Jacuzzi

[Hook]
The darkness in me follows me
Down the street it paints me green
The one on one, yeah that's me
They can't compete, they can never be me
The darkness in me follows me
Down the street it paints me green
The one on one, yeah that's me
They can't compete, they can never be me

[Verse 3: Danny Seth]
(The British are coming)
5 racks will make your girlfriend my wifey
Dem franchise boyz, oh I think they like me
I’m a London boy but I ain’t no Paki
And I still run up the checks like Nike
Top 5 underrated sound like me
If you fake then say you don’t like me
If you a snake then please do not bite me
That’s my cum on her face, she not crying
Get the fuck out my face if you lying
Get some blood on your face if you try it
Man I get it why they mad and it’s so sad cause my side chick your main like a lion
Don’t get why they lyin'
Cause they on my belt like Orion
And I blow that loud like a siren
And I got more hoes then a fire
You can’t bar with me
Even on a Xanax man you couldn’t bar with me
Let me tell you something bout this rap shit if you wanna war I got more bars then a pharmacy

[Hook]
The darkness in me follows me
Down the street it paints me green
The one on one, yeah that's me
They can't compete, they can never be me
The darkness in me follows me
Down the street it paints me green
The one on one, yeah that's me
They can't compete, they can never be me
