[Verse 1]

Whatever happened to the lights, cameras
All of that lost action
The fights, makeups
All of that lost passion
I guess it all happens when you growin old
And people recognize that your flow is cold
I wrote that when you were far away
Tell me you love I can do it but it's hard to say
No exits, I'd hate to see you walk away
She wanted Tiffany's but settled down with Cartier
(Sweet Jesus)
See the party don't stop till the Feds come
Had some bumps in the road I regret none
Niggas love talking to the birds
I just give em bread crumbs
You ever seen chandeliers on a jet?
A cigarette and coffee while I'm reading the gazette
Order another crepe, did you want any baguettes?
And I heard you like Prince well I got him on cassette, babe
My bow tie says I'm suited for this
Doing my 'Gangsta Lean' while you listen to Clipse
We can, zone out watch the lunar eclipse
And just, take action. Looking like you fitted for a pageant
Tell me everything that you never could imagine
Reenact dreams girl I was see the passion and catch it
I'm Tryna write the lyrics for your captions
We can sink in my yellow submarine
But you just want the scene
Parties on queen
If I drown would save me?
(Don't answer that)
If I lust could you blame me?

[Hook By Toro Y Moi]

So tell again
Don't let it in
Because I feel weak
Because I feel weak

Your tender mind
It's just like mine
Because I feel weak
Because I feel weak

And if I fall
Into the sea
Don't let me go
Because I feel weak

So tell again
Don't let it in
Because I feel weak
Because I feel weak

Your tender mind
It's just like mine
Because I feel weak
Because I feel weak

And if I fall
Into the sea
Don't let me go
Because I feel weak

[Verse 2]

Yeah, theres something different in you
I wrote this when I was thinking of you
Think of me while you play this
Most played in your playlist
I'm just tryna be your favourite
I'm here waiting
I wanna send you a text, but i don't wanna seem pushy
I don't wanna make it seem like I never seen pussy
Pardon my expression
And you ain't gotta worry bout them other bitches
Cause deep down you know you something bigger
You Annie Hall, and I'm Alvy Singer
If we ever had a problem, I wouldn't ask, 'what's the matter with you?'
I wanna be the one who matters to you
I wanna be the one who's married to you

So instead of the club, lets start a book club
I don't wanna be the reason, for you broken heart
Let's grow together, never grow apart
I'm being vocal, we were distant, she was local

[Verse 3]

Watchu mean I wasn't there when you needed me
That crystal ball is right in front of you its clear to see
Come and talk to me, I'll be Jodeci
I just wanted you to say yes, like you Floetry
Baby, how we argue and fuck
Argue and fuck, always
Argue for a week then have make up sex all day
Everytime I call you you ain't picking up your phone
Seems like you just only need me at the times you feel alone
(Bitch)
Its a sign, its a sign, sign that
Everytime I'm with you how i always want the time back
Going through my phone, texting numbers in my contact
Then you start to hit me why we always get in contact

Get out my face, get out my face
Can we be sane for 40 nights and 40 days
Girl change your ways x2
