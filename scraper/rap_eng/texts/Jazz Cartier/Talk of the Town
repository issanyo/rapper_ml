[Hook]
I am the prince of the city
I am the talk of the town
Nobody else fucking with me
Cause I am not fucking around
I am the prince of the city
I am the talk of the town
Nobody else fucking with me
Cause I am not fucking around
I am the prince of the city
I am the talk of the town
Nobody else fucking with me
Cause I am not fucking around
I am the prince of the city
I am the talk of the town
Nobody else fucking with me
Cause I am not fucking around
I am the prince of the city
I am the talk of the town
Nobody else fucking with me
Cause I am not fucking around

[Verse 1]
They say I sound like this, sound like that
Well all them niggas that I sound like, sound like Jazz
Fell off for a bit, 'til I bounced right back
But I'm that nigga right now, don't that sound right Lantz?
Pray to God this ain't my last record
If it is, there ain't no half stepping (nah)
I heard I lucked out with the M.I.P
But me and Lantz is back, the new M.I.B
Man I'm a downtown legend
Everybody feels threatenedâ€‹
You are not worthy of my presence
Black angel, I ain't going to heaven man
It's fuck paranoia, it's feelin' like armageddon  now
It's time to collect, mine and my rent
Step on my turf, bitch watch your step
Pardon my manners, I haven't slept
The old me just died, ask if I wept
The new me came back, asked where I went
Holes in my roof, I ain't content
Band on my bible, I don't repent
I am the star, this is my event
Damn Jazz and Lantz, back on they shit
Now all them haters back on they dick
Made an agenda, no plans to forget
If you step in my way, then you plan to get hit
I ain't finna spare nobody
I ain't tryna' hear nobody
I just spent  winter in hell and if you couldn't tell, I don't fear nobody
My nigga save the beef
Every time I drop, I see your plays increase
Instead of dissing online, you should be thanking me
(yeah, look)
I could turn that sob story to a horror story
Stay in your lane my nigga, this ain't your territory
The city's on a wave right now
If I was you, I'd be very worried
Everybody in the states compare me to Drake
Cause not many in the city can carry the weight
Y'all got it wrong, dropping two or three songs
Tryna' get a little buzz and get carried away
(nigga, shit, yeah)
I'm in it for the long run
You only in it for the wrong one (yeah)
I'm in it for the long run
And they still talking down bout the talk of the town

[Hook]
I am the prince of the city
I am the talk of the town
Nobody else fucking with me
Cause I am not fucking around
I am the prince of the city
I am the talk of the town
Nobody else fucking with me
Cause I am not fucking around
I am the prince of the city
I am the talk of the town
Nobody else fucking with me
Cause I am not fucking around
I am the prince of the city
I am the talk of the town
Nobody else fucking with me
Cause I am not fucking around
I am the prince of the city
I am the talk of the town
Nobody else fucking with me
Cause I am not fucking around

[Outro: Desk Clerk, Jazz Cartier]
Hi, and welcome to Hotel Paranoia
Where everyone checks in, and no one checks out
How may I help you?
I got a reservation under Cartier
Ah, okay, we've been expecting you!
One second while I contact my manager
Hello, mister Lantz? Mr. Jazz Cartier is here for check in
Hm, okay, thanks
Here you go Mr. Cartier, here are your keys
Thank you
100 roses are waiting for you in room 713
Ah, yes, would you mind doing me a little favor and uh, notify me once my guests arrive please?
They won't be until a little later
Ok
Thank you
Um, where's the elevator?
