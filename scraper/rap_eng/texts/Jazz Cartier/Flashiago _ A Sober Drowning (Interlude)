[Chorus]
Flashy, out of mind, out of sight
The only thing I'm seeing right now are these dollar signs
Flashy, out of mind, out of sight
The only thing I'm seeing right now are these dollar signs
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I feel like an outlaw, without y'all
Young 2Pac, dreadlocks and shit
I done came up, me and all my niggas
And we broke bread, not promises
Put the flow's up, they adopted it
Heard your album drop and niggas auctioned it
I'm Dwayne Johnson and you John Cena
Now who the fuck you think they Rocking with?
I got no limits, on Percy Miller
It's a toast to me, no rehearsal dinner
It's JLF, you can't etch-a-sketch
Not a damn square in my circle nigga
See I love women but I hate dating
Love money but I hate waiting
That's why I'm with your girl on this vacation
From all the days I've been cake chasing

[Chorus]
Flashy, out of mind, out of sight
The only thing I'm seeing right now are these dollar signs
Flashy, out of mind, out of sight
The only thing I'm seeing right now are these dollar signs
Out of mind, Out of mind, Out of sight
The only thing I'm seeing right now are these dollar signs
Out of mind, Out of mind, Out of sight
The only thing I'm seeing right now are these dollar signs
Flashy
(Flashiago, I'm so flashy, they call me Flashiago)

[Verse 2]
Sipping slow, lean done got me throwed
(Cuzzi pick it up)
Word on road the team about to blow
(I guess the jig is up)
I 'Diddy bop' my ass up out the bank
(Cause I got it, got it)
The I pull up to my shows in a tank
(Is you bout it, bout it?)
They ask "thats the style that you going for?"
If I'm going places then it's overboard
I'm an amputee playing piano keys
So you can ask Jeeves if I open doors
She said, "Jazz please!"
Yeah, of course!
Minds on the green, I gotta stay on course
I'm Tiger Woods with this wrist
But I swear to god I won't slip (yes)

[Chorus v2]

Flashiago.. Flashiago..
I'm so flashy, they call me Flashiago..
Flashiago.. Flashiago..
Como te llamo? C'est Flashiago

Flash (x3)

[A Sober Drowning]

(All I need, all I need x2)

Flashiago baby, uh
Man, some days I look at life differently
But I would never wish to be a different me
I ain't into making friends, I'm making history
So just hand me the brush, I'm Carviaggo with the imagery
My leather so soft... So soft that it's killing me
Highschool, they always tried to teach me 'bout civility
Cartier, thrilling ain't no mystery
But when I'm on that Pearl, is the only time I fuck with Tiffany
I ain't got no ex-girl, just some past reminders
That got some chemical imbalance I can't combat with science
And a pity fuck to me is just an act of kindness
The moon is shining, hell is not, but trust the light is blinding
So when I'm drunk off that Henny, my thoughts are scattered
I recollect a little later when my thoughts are gathered
A lot of y'all like to engage in that pompous chatter
Sit around and chatter 'bout shit that don't often matter
I had my young days when I was wreaking havoc
Live fast, die young, but I'm caught in traffic
Hah, Now-a-days I'll start to foster habits
Paint a broken canvas, I'm even quoting Hamlet
I make this shit that I be doing look so effortless nigga
Independent, check the pendant, I don't check for them niggas
I may as well just raise the bar, I got it set for you niggas
Heh, and you can take whatever's left of it nigga
Mama told me fuck the world and never play by the rules
So every track I'm going off like I got something to lose
Niggas flexing on the 'gram like they got something to prove
I throw a bone so y'all could fetch and give you something to do
They got my name up in they mouth to keep they name in the mix
They going out and mad that every DJ playing my shit
The more they talk about Jacuzzi, it ain't making no sense
I told your engineer to die and I just saved you a trip
For real

Flashiago baby, yeah

(Outro x2)
I said in my past life, they called me Cigarette Sam
Every party that I'm at, I got a drink in my hand
Just wake me up when it's over
