[First Verse: Jazz Cartier]
So, pardon me if I act strange
The way that cupid hit me you would think I had back pains
Shes the kind of girl I want sharing my last name
Her first name’s, Ella – I guess she attracts rain
So, we exchange emails
She's pretty rare for a female
I mean, we would collect seashells
No prom queen, but her beauty had detail
And, I love that she smells like cinnamon
I love that her love life’s innocent
On weekdays she would whistle & ‘plain
Saw my passport said she’s never been on a plane
May I…Introduce you as my girlfriend
I’m so confident, she’s my polar opposite
Getting compliments from women on different continents
Baby, I love it when you reach for the sky
But, you light up first week of July
The clouds become home when you frequently fly
So, as we look down on trees
The first flight overseas you’ll be speaking in Thai sayin’

[Bridge: Angus Stone]
She said, hello mister
Pleased to meet ya
I wanna hold her
I wanna kiss her
She smelled of daisies
She smelled of daisies
She drive me crazy
She drive me crazy

[Hook: Angus Stone]

Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane (X2)
Hey, hey

[Second Verse: Jazz Cartier]
She was a sophomore, I was a freshman
I was just average, she was perfection
She would say washroom, I would say restroom
She had the car, but I was giving directions
So alone we play scrabble en route to Seattle
Never used to travel, now she loves the hassle
Asked if I could rap? I think she wants to battle
Come a day I couldn’t have her I’d be happy with her shadow
Rings on her finger, bands on her wrist
At the bar, her best friends a martini with a twist
Her lifestyle? Sick of it
Everything’s sickening
The one to help me look when I was trying to find Elizabeth
Hates weed, reads Archie
The only girl wants to study while her friends go, and parties
A plain Jane, think about you when it rains
I’ll take it with a grain, and meet you on the plane

[Bridge: Angus Stone]
Be my lover
My lady river
Can I take ya
Take ya higher

[Hook]

Gonna hold ya
Gonna kiss ya in my arms
Gonna take ya
Away from harm
(X2)

[Hook]
