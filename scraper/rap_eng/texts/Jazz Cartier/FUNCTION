[Chorus]
Come slide at the function
You and all your girls finna dance all night
Come slide at the function
Don't ask if it's lit, girl you know what it is, no time for assumptions
Baby I'm high on life right now but a nigga need substance yeah
Too much textin', we need to be touchin', slide at the function, ay

[Verse 1]
You know I don't this for anybody
Luckily you just ain't anybody
A beauty like you must got plenty options
Baby is you with the Henny?
Regardless what it is, you know I'm bein' honest (bein' honest)
I've never broken a pinky promise
I don't get caught up in any drama
And you the solution to any problem, yeah
To any problem, that's how you know you a boss (know you a boss)
We can cook up a win from a loss (win from a loss)
And we nothing like Rachel and Ross
Nah, we more like Martin and Gina
Crazy in love like Ced and Lovita
I let you call but it's hard to hear you off the speakers
I'll send you the rest when I see you

[Chorus]
Come slide at the function
You and all your girls finna dance all night
Come slide at the function
Don't ask if it's lit, girl you know what it is, no time for assumptions
Baby I'm high on life right now but a nigga need substance yeah
Too much textin', we need to be touchin', come slide at the function
You and all your girls finna dance all night
Come slide at the function
Don't ask if it's lit, girl you know what it is, no time for assumptions
Baby I'm high on life right now but a nigga need substance yeah
Too much textin', we need to be touchin', come slide at the function

[Verse 2]
Ay, I'm willin' to put in the work
Don't put the car in reverse
You don't gotta show me your worth
You's a diamond in the rough, yeah
I can tell you had enough, ay
All these niggas run the same game
I see you callin' their bluff but you never givin' too much
You ain't impressed by a Gucci bag
You rather just chill and bump Gucci Mane
Call up in sick and watch Pootie Tang
Honestly I'd like to do the same (yeah)
For now I'ma sip on this juice, waitin' for you to come through
Don't wanna hear no excuse, the spot in the hills without you
So I'll wait 'til you make the move

[Bridge: BLK LT$]
As long as you keep me close
I'll be there to find you, I'll be right beside you
You can let your feelings show, I'm not here to judge you
I just wanna love you so baby won't you-

[Chorus]
Come slide at the function
You and all your girls finna dance all night
Come slide at the function
Don't ask if it's lit, girl you know what it is, no time for assumptions
Baby I'm high on life right now but a nigga need substance yeah
Too much textin', we need to be touchin', come slide at the function
You and all your girls finna dance all night
Come slide at the function
Don't ask if it's lit, girl you know what it is, no time for assumptions
Baby I'm high on life right now but a nigga need substance yeah
Too much textin', we need to be touchin', come slide at the function

[Bridge: BLK LT$]
As long as you keep me close
I'll be there to find you, I'll be right beside you
You can let your feelings show, I'm not here to judge you
I just wanna love you so baby won't you-
