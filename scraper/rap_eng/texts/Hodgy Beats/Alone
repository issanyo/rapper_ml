[Verse 1]
I'm never alone; it's me, myself and this misery
Darkness despite the 5/8 glitteries
Plug me in like I'm the new Kinect (360-Xbox)
Yeah, plug me in like I'm the new connect, slanging crack rock
Under the influence, underrated, my booth a sweatshop
Hang towels and tank tops on my Sony C800
Doctor tell me to quit, enzymes rising in my liver
But that's where me and him differ, nigga, I am not a quitter
Half the time, mind's in the shitter, I'm in the clouds, I hear the scriptures
Most of us don't love to be givers, pretty swell listeners, providing for those relying
You can't define who you are, give fine line print refinement
Motives for better timing, my motive's forever rhyming
I open the forum for them, they're waiting for me to chime in
And say what I said, Simon
I'm debating if I should sign in

[Verse 2]
I'm never alone; it's me, myself, and my son
I'm up before the sun for my son, that's my number one priority
Majority of people are minority; underhanded, I understand it
Being taken advantage of ain't the best feeling, is it?
The actions are found through anger, named it concealed imprisonment
I'm trying to implement the simple shit, not hoping for episodes of incidents
Which is prevalent without a settlement
I'm heaven-sent, hell bound, fresher than luxury with lemon scent
And peppermints, leather, tints, rev the 6 Series
Beep the horn and see if she can hear a bitch clearly
Make a bamboo earring, got her name in cursive in the center
A self-centered woman with no room for you to enter on her vagina's agenda
Got my name embedded, permanent henna
I'll forget the times we had, will find another to resemble her


[Bridge]
There's always that somebody
Could you possibly be that somebody, that's-uhh
Watching, learning, scheming, turning tables
There's always somebody, there's always that
Could possibly be that somebody, behind your back
Watching, learning, scheming, turning tables

[Outro]
Y'knamsayin?
Nowadays you just gotta watch your back, baby
I mean, you gotta watch your back like you got two backs
You feel me? Can't be trusting these motherfuckers
They all scheming, man. All they want is your motherfucking paper, your motherfucking talent, whatever you got, man
Don't give up your independence, nigga
And your motherfucking mind and that's all you got, y'nahmean?
Besides your word
