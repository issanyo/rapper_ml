[Intro]
Da-da-da-da
And we shall continue
H
One man band, nigga

[Verse 1]
I guess we have too much history to look past it
I pack this bowl of DMT with Palo Santo ashes
Hard body and hardy mills, man it's hard to be flaccid
With  press-your-own pills
I'm a hippie flippin' nigga on acid
Talk about a bad trip, bad character, Hodgy or Madlibb
Walking with a bad bitch, I'mma maverick
Independent-minded but passive
And aggressive like a catalyst
I run the town like Ben Affleck
Hodgy passionate, rob a Catholic, having sacraments
To give me pounds and an asterisks, slogan, and caption it
Adapting me, being adamant, savage and catching wild halibut like
My eradicate actions are an accident
I need the lump sum to aggregate
I'm not the one you wanna fuckin' aggravate
Rap politics and behind me is my protagonist
Hodgy back for chips, he ain't relaxed one bit
Rap politics and behind me is my protagonist
Hodgy back for chips, I ain't gonna relax one bit
Don't give no shits, nigga

[Hook]
Walk with me on this journey
Walk with me on this journey
Walk with me on this journey
Walk with me on this journey

(A half-dead thing in a stark dead world)

[Verse 2]
No affiliates, all these niggas I'm firing
You can only work for the man him is a dire need
Some food for thought
Risk, I supply the feed, one of a dying breed
Your clique is stomped on by [?]
Misguided fee in its entirety
Wait til the fat lady inquires things and the strings
Puppets make 'em play out their modest scene
You all on a bunch of ecs' that hunch on backs
I read you fakes in 30 seconds from front to back
Nigga run it back, run it back, runnin' laps, gun in straps
One semi-auto sound like a hunnid gats to me
You're Little like Stuart in this city, you're just another rat
Trynna fit in doing jumping jacks
I'm cutting records and bagging 'em like I'm pumping crack

[Hook]
Walk with me on this journey
Walk with me on this journey
Walk with me on this journey
Walk with me on this journey

(A half-dead thing in a stark dead world)
