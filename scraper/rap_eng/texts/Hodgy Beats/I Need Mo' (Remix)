[Intro: Taco]
I see a bitch, I meet a bitch
I tweet a bitch, I fuck a bitch
I leave a bitch
Den I do a Stevie
I don't see a bitch

[Chorus]
One gold ring, two gold rings
Three gold rings, nigga, I need mo'
One gold ring, two gold rings
Three gold rings, nigga, I need mo'
One gold ring, two gold rings
Three gold rings, nigga, I need mo'
One gold ring, two gold rings
Three gold rings, nigga, I need mo'

[Verse 1: Mike G]
Pullin' exotic women about as rarest kicks you seein' me in
Think of ways to kill the game before it even begins
And when bitches show and tell, I stand them up like comedians
You preceding, heads beating, Like you nodding in agreement
Stop tryin' to break us down it could help build your character
Put on my chains and drove my Porsche to vote, Cause I love America
Who you know got a style so loud and rude
But still slow and smooth Like it was chopped and screwed
I know you slept, And sleeping keep you in debt
On the block, You're lucky to see my silhouette
Realize recognition was only once a dire request
We got our props, Now its time to get our checks
OF

[Chorus]
One gold ring, two gold rings
Three gold rings, nigga, I need mo'
One gold ring, two gold rings
Three gold rings, nigga, I need mo'
One gold ring, two gold rings
Three gold rings, nigga, I need mo'
One gold ring, two gold rings
Three gold rings, nigga, I need mo'

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
You can't beat me, nigga, if you tried (Stop bitch)
Your bitch told you could? Nigga, she lied (Dumb hoe)
Don't look surprised 'cause your bitch switch side
This shit right here, nigga, happens all the time
Woke up this morning with a different outlook (Okay)
Thought about the niggas who bitches I took (Snatched)
Wonder why it happen, I just started rappin' (Okay)
Nigga in the Fader, now deny you wanna dap me
Maybe it's the picture frame, pinky ring, my blue stone gold ring
[?] can't match my Medusa chain
My gold nugget watch, yeah, my gold never [?]
[?] goes at the bottom, nigga, one at the top
Bitch

[Chorus]
One gold ring, two gold rings
Three gold rings, nigga, I need mo'
One gold ring, two gold rings
Three gold rings, nigga, I need mo'
One gold ring, two gold rings
Three gold rings, nigga, I need mo'
One gold ring, two gold rings
Three gold rings, nigga, I need mo'

[Verse 3: Hodgy Beats]
Actually, never mind ma
I don't need shit
I just need a bitch with a fat booty
On my Polex
That's my thumb for her bum
Sit on, pop it, watch the Rolex ring
Hold on tight, without her might
Ridin' on my pogo springs
I throw my hand out my window
When a nigga cut me off
Got three rings on one finger, nigga
Don't get fuckin' bossy
Point 'em out and shoot 'em down
Smoke a pack that last a round
Ounces to pounds
I get around, you bounce around
Little nigga
