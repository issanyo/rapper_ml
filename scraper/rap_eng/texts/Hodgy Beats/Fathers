[Intro]
Feel it. And this goes out to uh, all those hard workers. All them hard working daddies out there. I see you nigga. Even the ones that ain't counting for, I'm still counting. And your child's still counting on you, nigga. You go 'head run that. You go 'head run that, feel me

[Hook]
Happy Father's Day (Fathers! Happy Father's Day dad)
Happy Father's Day (I love you) (Fathers!)
Happy Father's Day (You are literally my super hero!) (Fathers!)
Happy Father's Day (Dad I just want to let you know you're the best) (Fathers!)

[Verse 1]
Parenting is a difficult task, a gift that keeps on giving back
For as long as I'm alive, hope these residuals last
Business is focused on a individual's path
Usually I'm rolling weed or sipping the flask
I'm beautifully changing my ways, man my kid is a blast
Lunch-a-montasoury with dad hop in the car seat
Let's go to the studio and listen to jazz
Strings and the brass, a snare and the cup
No matter the cause, I'm here for whatever happens
He's coloring next to me while I'm writing flows rap
My son is timeless born in a timely fashion
I'm happy

[Hook]
Happy Father's Day (Fathers!)
Happy Father's Day (Fathers!)
Happy Father's Day (Fathers!)
Happy Father's Day (Fathers!)

[Verse 2]
I could've left him with his mom to go and be this famous nigga
Instead we got a bond, our relation ain't aimless nigga
I was with her when she gave birth, I named my nigga
Sign my name on the certificate
I read the signs from the heavensthough I was illiterate
Stare at that boy, every second he got more [?], magnificent
You see Hodgy used to be a [?]
An [?] upon himself, illegitimate
I'm submitting the slip of eternal significance
My life I would dedicate it and give to him
Twenty years old trippin' lifted in the wind
When this kid got my genes [?]
No more my altered substances and [?] of gin
I was carrying vices, new life was ready to begin
Sent my prayer to the heavens if they come back then I'll resend
A heartthrob teaching his son to be a gentlemen
Amen

[Hook]
Happy Father's Day (Fathers!) (Can we go to the park)
Happy Father's Day (Fathers!) (I want to get ice cream)
Happy Father's Day (Fathers!)
Happy Father's Day (Fathers!) (Hahahahaha, thanks dad)
