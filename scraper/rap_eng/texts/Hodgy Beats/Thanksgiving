[Intro]
Yeah, yeah smoke
It's H

[Verse 1]
I live every breathe to the fullest
If there's a trigger around me, pull it out
And squeeze it til I'm sweating bullets
How can you blame us, we're craniums in containers
Tasmanian Devil dangerous
My level of anxiousness is [?]
Tell her to bang, tell her to hurry up with her day shift
Good evening, the night is where she come pick up like Bayless
I'm racily pacing for my check waitress
It's free to speak to me, sharing frequencies while I'm faded
Imagine being poked in the eye, looking death in the mirror
Like motherfucker I hear you, a lot of common people fear us
I'm familiar similarities, searching for clarity
It's black and white until you see it transparently
Watching people live life like it's a parody
I puff puff and I don't share the weed
You want nice cause I don't care to be
I yell mean things when people stare at me
And yes, I am aware of these issues
Readily packed [?] off the battle grass and gravel
It's a dirty trail where I've traveled
[?] and false idols
Swearing on the Bible, a bunch of lions and tigers
Taking moments to feel intitled
Take [?] to feel the rifle
Niggas in Paris, I take a moment to see the Eiffel
And take a photo, then take it home and repeat the cycle
We skate with logos and do the shit that we fucking like to
You lames is homos, you Tony Romo
Just beat it, Michael

[Hook] (x2)
I ain't nothing but a nigga
I ain't nothing but a nigga rolling Swishers
I ain't nothing but a nigga rolling Swishers
In the middle of the village
With the Indians and Pilgrims having Thanksgiving

[Verse 2]
I used to be the kid but now I'm switching my role
Was given a sort of [?]
Hands full of fortune cookies, fortune teller was close
Out with another hooker, now she wearing my robe
Saying she'll keep the house warm as I travel the globe
These nosy ass women won't stay out of their nose
Niggas come around the block cause they want to be exposed
Well I expose them to this fist and a fucking broken nose
Say this Golf Wang bitch, don't make me water down your hose
[?] and blowing O's
Rolling dope and throwing shows
We're supposed to be nothing like it's nothing man here it goes
Why you talking on Twitter but in person you tippy toes
And if you ever speak my name in an interview again
I'ma cut you and your friends, throw sticky bombs on your Benz
Since my niggas comedians, they take us all for pretend
Like the [?], don't let it be one of them
Cause I..

[Hook] (x2)
