[Verse 1]
You told me you loved me, but you were unsure
I told you I hated you when you closed the door
The tension in your leg is shakin' the floor
You make the situation sticky like a melted s'more
I yell at you, hittin', I kiss you more
No other girl-girl did me like this before
You wanted me, I wanted simple
But honestly I didn't know what I was gettin' into

[Hook]
Change it up
I'm tired of your lies

[Verse 2]
You yell at me while you're in my ear
I walk away cause it ain't the telephone I hear
It is you, full of it, rodeo style, bullshit
I hear you got another, I wanna bet he ain't a baller
Well homie I'm gonna let you know every time I call her
She gone pick up the phone cause my pockets stand taller
You can keep her how much I'll make you an offer
Back to you girl, how you gone cheat?
Give me like six feet, shit's deep, get feet
You're a child and I got this sign that says outta reach
Say good bye the phantom, glass house on the beach

[Hook]
