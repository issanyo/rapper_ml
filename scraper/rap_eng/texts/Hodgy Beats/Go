[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
A fan'll spot me like a fucking giraffe
I'm schoolin' niggas, cool it nigga, I ain't fucking with class
Countin' cheerios, I ain't talkin' cereal
You pussy niggas venereal, it's that time of the month
I spark in the dark like I'm lighting a blunt
Slide up in a drunk cunt and give her what she don't want
I'm smokin', she's snortin', I'm pimpin' like Jordan
My bitches' assortments,I make 'em important
Yo bitch more like, "Umm, aight"; Nigga, mine is gorgeous
No chicken head, I'm gettin' head while gettin' bread
I live instead to make your life a living dead, get it? Yeah
I'm like a riverbed with a vocab, my technology is programmed
To smoke grams, go ham, this just one of my slow jams
Pull the Dom Perignon and the ace of spades
Get drunk on you bitch mades, lemonade
Bittersweet, I ain't in the hood but I'm in the streets
Just ask my name, bitch

[Hook]
You know my MO, extra'd out ammo
My fingers ticklish like elmo
Maharishi camo, you lil' niggas nano
The first move since the chicano
Quasadilla with the carne asada
Viva Zapatas, I fiend for the ganja
That's me, pack it in the bowl with golden spoons
Put the stems in hot water like you're holdin' shrooms

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Fuck your fuckin' assumptions, I get it bumpin' like acne on a pre-teen
Puffin' mean green 'til my world feel like a green screen
Started off a nightmare, now I fuckin' eat dreams
They be fiendin' for the shit that we bring, we the redeem team
Bars like sing-sing and I'm about to spring clean these scenes
I was born to run, Bruce Springsteen
Son of a bitch and a half, trick, I spaz shit
Nine lives left to react bitch, you catnip
Swag sick, turn a snobby ho into a bagged bitch
Swag like it's crack on deck, the fiends backflip
Lay that wack shit in a casket
Bum ass raps with no point like a cracked wrist
And I've been at it for a year and a half
Fast motion, same lane, gearin' the gas
And I ain't fuckin' with these niggas, all I'm hearin' is trash
I fuck with gettin' paid nigga, all I'm hearin' is cash, bitch

[Hook]
