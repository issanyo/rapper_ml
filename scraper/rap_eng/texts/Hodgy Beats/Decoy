[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]

I'm never fool for fools gold
Most of these niggas tools, I use hoes
Back and forth, I'm an active force
If I was a color I would be blue balls
Full of new goal, more than one
It's OF bitch there's more to come
Coming from a layup, the poor is slums
A Nigga in a house got the poorest gums
I'm still forgotten to be mentioned, but ain't no point of a trio
Cause' the nigga who take the first step slips, I be second
I trip out listening to brand new records, nigga and I'm wreaking
Motha'fuckas' dont want a piece of me, I'm tekkin'
Betta' get the steppin' or I'll hit you with weapon
The weapon will get you steppin' like an anti-depressant, end it all
What it all is a blessing it is, to live a life like mine
I look at my reflection and I see my shine
In my stainless steel protection (Uh huh) (tection')
I kill them all with music, bought this fuckin' Smith and Wesson (Brrrrrooop)

[Hook x2]

Dreams don't go away
Dreams are turned into a nightmare
You gotta' watch yourself
Go and get some eye care
Cause' what do a nigga like I care?
Suggestion ain't shit but an idea
And it's quite clear, that brightened air
We the fruit of flies, it's so ripe a year

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]

I just turned 21, cabernet glass I'm a wine-o
Cool cat with like 9 souls, like origami tie folds
Don't call the hommage, its a live show
I'm a fresh a nigga, ain't jive though
Don't play me for my do-re-mi, or I will go crazy
Insane as my mother when she laid me, 24 with a baby
Single, broke and a lady, till this day that shit still phase me
Cause until' she's in that Mercedes and that house in Venezueles'
I ain't gon' stop
"Fuck you pay me" or you gon' see the today me
I got so many bitches on my dick right now
Left Brain finna' go and cop a whip right now
Here we young and gettin' it in where we fit right now
Playas' be in the game, not on the bench right now
Shoot for the sky like a pop up, through your city we pop up
Open shop up, guap up, and sell out, a lot of stuff, (Bitch!)
And it ain't about money, niggas got responsibilities
Use your gadget utilities, to fulfill the need, feeling me?

[Hook x2]

Dreams don't go away
Dreams are turned into a nightmare
You gotta' watch yourself
Go and get some eye care
Cause' what do a nigga like I care?
Suggestion ain't shit but an idea
And it's quite clear, that brightened air
We the fruit of flies, it's so ripe a year

(Ughh)
