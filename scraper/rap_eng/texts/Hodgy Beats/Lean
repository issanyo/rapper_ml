[Intro: Hodgy Beats]
Oh shit
Yeah, shut up bitch
Bitch, bitch shut up
The fuck up
The fuck you talkin', shut the fuck up
Bitch

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
If I was a dinosaur I would be a Flexasaurus
Since you don't like what the fuck you heard â€“
Fast forward to the chorus
Hodgy Beats, Odd Future, Golf Wang, nigga
But there's more of us
Coroner's out, when I'm killing the gorgeous
Diamond cut like what the fuck is flawless?
Tell the runner to go and get me some gold
Cause I'm bubblin' on you whores
I'm such a mystery, mysterious
More quiet than a hipster Prius
Takin' a trip to Egypt
Niggas claim to be scenic
When I know they ain't seen shit
I see shit, fuckin' seasick
Rain showers is what I predict
My flow is like gymnastics
So, beef flips, patty cake
Smoke a pound of dro, for the algae taste
Say 'What up' to my pinky, say 'Hi' to my index
Fuck all the hoes, one middle finger
Thumb take shots like a Pentax
Bitch, I kill 'em all, you could just write off they death tax
Boxin' niggas out of the mic, punch lines, death-match

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
I invented swag
Fuck what these other niggas talkin' 'bout
Niggas wanna brag 'bout the shit that they lack
But the truth of the fact, it's all word of mouth
Talk a lot of crap, but ain't shit for sure
Bathin' Ape shit that I get for low
I don't pay much and I don't say much
But I still got a swag you should get to know
I flip a show, spend it on apparel
Spanish bitch tell me I look mucho dinero
Then she say she love me and I tell her I don't care ho
I'm in the fast lane with my foot on the pedal
Smash, I'm takin' off
Lot of niggas hate, but I shake 'em off
Put that hash in a bong, it'll make ya cough
And the purp's goin' down like the Lakers lost
Cause we them niggas, yeah
Doper than a 80's, baby
Careful, I might snatch your bitch and turn her to a wavy lady
Scare 'em when I'm taking steps
Sorry, bitch, I paper chase
When I get where I am
I want my demands
With my nuts in my hand
Like 'Fuck you, pay me"

[Outro: L-Boy]
Yeah! Balls in my hands!
Monster cock! Odd Future Wolf Gang!
Kill Them All! Yeaaaaah
