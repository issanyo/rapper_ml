I'm tired of these hoes, I need a real bitch
To handle all the things that I don't wanna deal with
I said I need a real bitch
She buys her own accessories and her heels sick
That's a real bitch
She really wants me alive, but she kills dick
Now that's a real bitch
And I'm a real nigga and we the realest
Fuck real estate, we in the realest state
Counting paper bills behind the bill of gates
Peak out my Left Eye, look at her Chilli face
Could this be TLC, or is it really hate
I need a real bitch, where my bitches at?

[Hook]
Where my bitches at?

[Left Brain]
Yeah, man, a real bitch, she come home
Cook a nice little meal for a nigga, you know I'm saying
A real bitch don't mothafuckin' run her mouth and shit, you know what I mean
Real bitches wash the dishes, you know what I mean
Real bitches help out to pay the bills and shit, you know what I'm saying
Give a nigga a massage when they come home from a long day at work
Some real bitch shit, where my real bitches at?

[Taco]
I need a real bitch who can make french toast and suck dick
She's 5'6" with firm tits
Went to UCLA until she met my dick
You wanted to be a doctor? I bet you did
But if if was a fit then you wouldn't be my bitch
Making steak and bacon, that's your job, you stupid trick
Your daddy's rich, indeed, now please hit your knees
My dick won't suck itself, if it wasn't for my cock, you would have bad health
You crave my junk, kick-box lessons so you won't get pregnant
I pull that bastard out myself, on some real nigga shit
I trap, you suck, and the world fucking spins, swag

[Left Brain]
Riding with my bitch and you know she hella chill
Coachella, front row, baby girl pop a pill
Show me how you feel, bitch keep it real, swag

[Hodgy Beats]
Um, a real bitch, let me see, she gotta have her own swag
Which means she's setting trends for all the bitches out there, I see you
Um, a real bitch, she has to have her own mothafuckin' vehicle
And of course she paying for that motherfucker cause she a real bitch
You know what I'm saying, she handle her own business
A real bitch don't play no games at all, don't say no names
Don't say no pillowtalk up in this motherfucker
Wolf Gang needs real bitches, swag
And a real bitch gotta know how to roll my weed up
