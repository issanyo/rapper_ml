[Intro]
The thing about doors, yeah (What about 'em)
They open, they close (What about 'em)
They open, they close (I'm talkin' bout)
Doors, doors, doors, yeah (Yeah, yeah, what about 'em)
They open, the close (What about 'em)
They pen, they close (Hodgy Beats)
Monsters Inc

[Verse 1]
That's why I'm not really tripping on nothing
I know that  I'm after me, not just after nothing
It's Halloween I ain't sitting in a patch with the pumpkins
I leave my house when I go out, I'm coming back with something
I'm coming back with substance, not a fucking assumption
I'm down to malfunction as long as I'm reaching resumptions
Conjunction conjunction, what is your function?
My angels battling my demons, they kicking and punching
I isolated myself, now I'm all alone
All alone at the table praying before my luncheon
I pray all day and night, I pray before work in my dungeon
I'm praying it's pungent,  I'm crying shaving onions
The caveman in the jungle working on being humble
When I bad trip I fall hard, I ain't slipping or stumble
Niggas worse than uncle [?] and he's my fuckin' uncle
I bake the cookie watch it crumble

[Outro]
I like that beat, I wanna make...
