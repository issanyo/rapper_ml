[Intro]
Remembering the days of you and I, Rest in Peace

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Sometimes I feel like death's coming
Struggling for every breath running
Eye to the scope, the best's the hunting
I'm the fetcher and the chef of my destiny honey
Can't let the fame get the best of my money, paying bills for my fam
Cause paper ain't flowing like it used to when they were youthful, I'm useful
Living for reasons larger than what you're bartering, we still hearted
Cause we were working harder then, I spread my life out on it, Ottoman
"A man's trash, another's gold," said the garbage man
All the hatred goes off the docks from what you're harboring

[Hook: Syd Tha Kid]
They say, "Somewhere between space and time, stray my tears"
Hey, hey, Everything will be alright
Just remember to breath
Remember to breath
Just remember to breath
Remember to breath
Just remember to breath

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Been across the boardwalk, back against the Walmart
Came back from paying loan sharks
I shoot for tranquility with long darts
Shopping carts full of Poptarts, we paid fill-up
Light a J and we blaze Dilla, dank killer
Holidays became a day where I can't feel a thing
And I'm remembering the days of you and I
Me and you were a mission that was suicide
But fuck it, fuck luck, it's do-or-die
So drunk off love, got a D.U.I
That's why I'm getting high like when the seagulls fly
Got the heart of a lion and an eagle's eye
I swear the truth hold true, don't feed me lies
I'd rather freely die than let them beat me tied
So let track play till it's completely dry
Reminiscing the day of me, Irene, and myself

[Hook: Syd Tha Kid]

[Outro]
Remembering the days of you and I, remembering the days of you and I, Rest in Peace
