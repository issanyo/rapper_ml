[Sample x3]
Done it again, done it again, done it again

[Verse 1]
I got a bunch of zippers, i can play Thriller
If I get pulled over they'll assume a dealer
For real a blunt smoke skunker than [?]
How this weed gon' harm and kill ya?
It's softer than a pillow, get familiar
[Sample]
Let your mind spin like a pillar
I feel like godzilla when i'm high on Pot sticker
Tolerance through the ceiling so i smoke a lot
Niggas store it anywhere today, i got some [?] socks nigga
My thought process is roll a spliff, light, and repeat
Smoking those tea trees, with a bird, Tweety
Hot-boxing in my TV
Took a hike at mount Mary Jane and lost my shoes like [?]
I'm completely

[Sample]

[Bridge]
I'm coppin' the weed from the grower
Then we break it down into the grinder
Nigga I'm blunted again. Blunted again. Blunted again
Dog I lost my trees, don't see em nowhere
Losing my mind, somebody help me find her
I gotta be done it again, done it again, done it again

[Verse 2]
Attention span shorter than Kevin Hart
Smoke like I got eleven hearts
Smoke like when the engine starts
Smokin' weed is the dopest part
Smokin' weed is a work of art
I’m rollin' weed into a Noah’s Ark
J so fat it’s ‘bout to fall apart
Shippin’ coastal hit the smoke before my flight departs
TSA smell me second handed like a fart
Then we die and hella weed marry marry me
I pray to see the day when you happily bury me
I’m ole ye faithful you never worry me
You’re the only one I want, girl, let me take a knee
The highest mountain is the place to be
Where ain’t no escaping you
And ain’t no replacing me
You can find me with E
The smoke is chasing me
Where the blunt is facing me
I can only make it weed

[Bridge]
