[Verse 1]
You gotta be present for the moment of momentum
Kill a coward with my lyric, the murder is cobra venom
I'm hurdling further engines, running through an entrance
Such a resemblance in the mirror, I see a blemish
The chemist, I am with dentist, six senses
As of now, life is tennis at Venice, such a breeze I can feel it
Rolling up my sleeves, put a little hash in it
Exceeding cash limits, if you got it ain't a bad image
I play the ball mothafucka, not half a scrimmage
Your gimmicks just mimic cause you do not have an image
I'm sixty seconds past the minute
Cabbage lettuce, cash is fetish and me? I'm grabbing spinach, yeah

[Hook]
Heard about a nigga rapping? Yeah, that's just one of my bitches
I'm selling weed here trapping, that's just one of my bitches
Clientele paying taxes, that's how I'm running my business
Stay the fuck off of my mattress, they sleeping on us niggas

[Verse 2]
Got my own flow
Spend my own dough, drive my own car, fucking grown hoes
Thirty-four old, birdie plural, at my door no cheese DiGiorno
Vulnerable, shoot a porno, losing wardrobe, your body full clothes
When the doors closed, the mask of zoro, has to more though
A comedy, I'm sick I'll probably suffocate from all of them vomiting
Fuck commenting, I'm committing, taking off, rocketing while I'm profit
Pocketing, hommaging, sock 'em bop 'em, king, not fosters out the ring
Boom bada bing, I gotta sing, you should fucking honor me
All these collard greens, dollar greens
Presidents holla scream, prophecies
Roll up and watch the leaves, germinate, regurgitate
First you like it then you love it, third is hate

[Hook]
