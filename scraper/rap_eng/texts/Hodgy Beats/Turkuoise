[Intro: Hodgy]
Grab that Dom Perignon real quick?
Pop that motherfucker and just pour it out
In my glass that is, haha

[Verse: Hodgy]
Said I've been acting different lately, well we could have a conversation about it
And when we have this conversation, we don't have to be raising our voices and debating about it
You say your main focus in this relationship is loving everything that we created around it
I'm on your team, I never switch sides
High five, we ain't a big five, mark the signs like a riptide
You keep a nigga grounded like the pavement and that's what's amazing about you, a motherfucking
Mystery you are, I'm just trying to figure you out
Girl, I ain't chasing to doubt you, and if another
Person come in my face and try and talk and disgrace you
I still can't live without you, girl
We go together like TV dinners and couch food
Food for thought, all this food got her mouth full
Manners and etiquette and some house rules
Tired of being in the house, we hanging out? Cool
Learn a life lesson with you and without school
Girl, you fly and I'm the jet, and that's without fuel
I kick it like some house shoes then get around to
Arousing you cause I'm allowed to, how smooth, uh
I beat it up in the first round, then I knock it out in round two, yeah

[Hook: Hodgy]
Baby, you're an angel
I could tell cause of your halo
(You're, you're my angel)
Look at you from different angles
Cause you were the one that I was made for
(You're, you're my, my, my, my, my, my, my)
And that's real
(Angel)

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
You in love with the idea of being with me
Loving the idea, what we could be
Loving all that you see and you see it in me
Love a relationship when you be in it free
We pull up together, we peeping the scene
If we ain't fucking with it, we weave and then leave
Hold on to your hand, knowing I won't mislead you
I'm overseas, I wanna come over to see you
She my westside story, Santana and Maria
Turn all my gray days to amarilla
Baby got me slowing down the margaritas
She said we blend well like a barista
A-E, I owe you my vows
In front of the choir and the preacher
You're fully loaded, come with all of the features
And I didn't mean to, I just happened to meet you like, yeah

[Hook: Hodgy]
You're, you're my angel
My, my, my
You're, you're my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Angel

[Outro]
"It's true love you know..? And part of that is not having no expectations? No judgement, mm
Just accepting each other as is
No assumptions... I've made too many assumptions and have been very disappointed."
