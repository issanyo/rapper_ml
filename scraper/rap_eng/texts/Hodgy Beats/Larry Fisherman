[Hodgy Beats]
Fuckin' Trippin'
I'm fuckin' trippin'
Yep, Yep
Aye, can you dim the lights?
Smoke!

[Hodgy Beats]
[Verse 1]

Sippin' beer and whiskey getting frisky hopscotch
Words mistaken this place escapin' my tongue like pop rocks
Went to a bar alone, in my lap the Glocks cocked
Looking for a hot bop with a boyfriend that cock blocks (Faggot)
No service in this bitch, Good thing I'm near a hot spot
Time is money, clocks flock, like a cherry I'm on top (Hahaha)
You askin' me rhetoricals, knowing where all my morals go
A stampede bitch you plant the seed, let the florals grow
She give me oral throat, good behavior, being cordial
Time is money hun, its twentys back into my portal
Other words disturb and hurt me absurdly but I'm immortal
Thuggish, ruggish, smoke blunts till sluggish, I'm fuckin' durable
Adorable, the way these samples flip, thanks to fishy man
He don't give us spam, we the a kitchen clan
River sand, in my bibs, I'm itchy man, Finna' hit amoeba
And spent sixtey on Lionel Richie (Yep!)
We all gon' die, I might just bring my baby mama with me (Yep)

[Domo Genesis]
[Verse 2]
See, pussy nigga, what’s your life like? (Huh?)
‘Cause mine’s hype, eyes fixed on the limelight
Should’ve signed twice, wrecked five mics (bitch)
Finna eat like an orgy scene with five dykes
Weed flight, puffin’, have to ask "dog, I’m alive, right?"
A live wire, spit a virus out like Limewire
Break it down so I can climb higher
In his prime, watch him supply fire
Get a grip, I’m going nuts like Money Mike, supply pliers
Ridin' high up in the Pied Piper
Nigga, look at how I’m pissin' on ‘em
Mac throw the alley, I Blake Griffin on 'em
Wolf Gang, dysfunctional family, Eddie Griffin on 'em
"High" hats, moving shit, even got Diddy on 'em
Bitch, I’m a monster
Beat it, never leak it, my seed, I skeet in the Contra
Set cause I bet I wouldn’t play a decent father
They’ll never be a another me, bring seats to my imposters
So haters back that ass up like Juvenile
Get her Suboo while 'bout to do this shit Rasputin style
Niggas didn’t trip, gave room and I’m a nuisance now
What’s beef? I’ll bring a meat cleaver to you stupid cows
Hot headed, need some heat-seakers to shoot him down
Inglewood nigga, just a product of what he grew around
It’s young me, Dom’s gettin’ what he fuckin' needs
Forever blessed, like bad allergies, you just a fuckin' sneeze
My dreams floated in the wind and grabbed some fuckin' breeze
The crap I spit disgusting, so these ratchets on they fuckin' knees
You niggas save the bullshit, I’m a matador
I’m gettin' swiss cheese overseas by the Matterhorn
