[Hook]
The wave, the wave
The wave, the wave
The wave, the wave
Ooh the wave, ooh the wave

[Verse 1]
Lately my powers have been rising higher
Fighting off all the demons below me
And whatever the case may be, a mophie
My batteries on full charge and I'm paying attention closely
I've learned that ball is life and I'm the goalie
My pride is my treasure
My ego is stashed away like a goatee
My pen is pointy, start provoking
Pain's what I harbor mostly
And who I talk to openly, impartially ghostly
My ancestors are keen, conversion of poetry
I'm glad they know me
For the most part mostly
The past, the present, and the future, I'm Jodeci
I'm glad they know me
As I turn the page
Hours turn to days as I grow in age
Existed in my emotion standing before my rage
Burning intensive sage
That's preparation for the next wave

[Hook]
The wave, the wave
The wave, the wave
The wave, the wave
Ooh the wave, ooh the wave

[Bridge]
Can't get away from the waves, they are humongous
Washing away everything in sight
And just as you thought you could run away
The wave will be here today
Brace yourself, here it comes

[Verse 2]
A man could fall but never on all fours like a [?]
A prelude bowing down to Jesus
A community having communion
Sharing crackers and grape juice
A spider's on the pew, kill it
It's H the recluse
On the loose like alcoholics with Grey Goose
I'm Boston made like Babe Ruth
My steel toed nubucks suede too
My future's a mirage
Experiencing deja vu
And out of all of my siblings I'm the voodoo child
Was a voodoo child as a juvenile
Grown up nigga, I'm a mutant now
Throwing flames, spitting butane now
Got the cutest smile
Beauty sleeping [?]
Taking [?] for the next wave as usual
I'm delusional

[Outro]
