[Produced by Knxwledge]

I never dream constantly, onto better things
Living inside my self-consciousness
I walk up to the doorstep, on the mat, and press the bell that rings
Dealing with goals that I'm conquering
Edit segments until it works for me
I never sell myself short, enough for purchasing
Removing the king from his throne, that's how you hurt the king
I look at life and drive thru it like it's Burger King
Death is upon us, [?] this is the murder scene
To the first degree
A freedom writer, there's no purgery
When shit gets ill, it's good for surgery
The light shining through the window, the curtain's clean
Time to get out of momma's house and go serve the fiends
My goals are magnified but it's all still a blur to me
And I'm okay with not having it all figured out
No right or wrong way to live life, that's something to think about
From a shack in Ashanti town to a bigger house
There is gold inside your soul, you gotta dig it out
Search for it, [?] forward
Pain is love nigga, and hurt's torture
A couple tricks up my sleeve, I'm the sorcerer
Of course [?] of the resourceful
He floss inside of Porsche then clutching the turbo

I never dream constantly, onto better things
I wanna fly away, just need my set of wings
Tired of going back and forth like I'm on a swing
A lot of shit buzzing around, I'm the hornet that stings
Born as a prince, more of a king
Engagement life, never wore the ring
Love my life in the numbers, one for three
Money make her come but will she come for me
If I chased her man, she would run from me

I never dream constantly, make realities
Smoking, burning calories
Falling short from an apple tree
My art is golden in gallery
I miss my homies like I'm Master P
I let it burn man, this whole  bag of weed
Crack the seal and pouring out all the drink
And if my album leaks, I'ma just call a freak to *fuck* me til I fall asleep
On the couch she pick me up, drag me across the suite
Ran into my subconscious we ainâ€™t talk for some weeks
It's [?] we meet, finally

Oh, let me hear that (For sho')
