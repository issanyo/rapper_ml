[Intro Hook: Hodgy]
I listened to "Patience" by Guns N Roses
I listened to "Patience" by Guns N Roses
Nothing's forever I forecast then foreclose
An illusion
What I'm seeing all for show
An illusion
What I'm seeing all for show
As I listened to "Patience" by Guns N Roses
I listened to "Patience" by Guns N Roses

[Verse 1: Fard]
My focus is unfocused, ripping and running
Most of these niggas is stunting
Your double cup got you looking washed up
Washed out the waves out
Watch out like Max B
I Mario Luigi, I be on a mushroom
Give me space, give me room
Give me face and outerspace [?]

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
What's the demeaner of your demeaner
Pain in my femur
Stranger reefer
Blowing O's like spots on a cheetah
Girl you a diva, [?], a misunderstood
I [?] two seater [?] speeding like [?]
While I'm listened to "Patience" by Guns N Roses
Pray nobody comes in between us
Adam and Eve [?]
Keep the crystal glass on the coaster
Make sure the [?] toasted
Pour all of it in my cup, I make the most of it
I think what I'm seeing [?] proceed to toast to this

[Outro Hook: Hodgy]
An illusion
What I'm seeing all for show
An illusion
What I'm seeing all for show
I listened to "Patience" by Guns N Roses
I listened to "Patience" by Guns N Roses
