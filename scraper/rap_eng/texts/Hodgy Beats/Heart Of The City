Hodgy Beats!
Just in case you didn't know

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I've been around the world
Like misplaced grocey's, I'm a go back
Those memories are Kodak
Take a snap for the throwback
My snapback is my hat
Track is on a throw back
My city's behind be the highest
Climbing up the fucking rope back
Twisting off the cat, I'mma roll up swishers
Blow that weed like [-], first make a couple wish'es
In 2005 I was putting in 5 to get high
Now we get on [-] just to get fly
How does it feel to be the best, I'm in my way to be next
You bought to push my way through
So money come's with paids due
Mellowhype jersey, felling worthy
Who cut that paid due's, Odd Future reigning terror
Better weigh your rain[-]
Man it's great when you the shit
But when it's turning your thing's get drained in
You running for the chair, you run your job, campaigning
Swear an under oath protecting
Like an umbrella when it's raining
Got America on her toes so much her toe nail's breaking

[Hook:]
Ain't no love, in the heart of the city
Ain't no love, in the heart of time

[Verse 2: Hodgy Betas]
I wanna be the perfect pops to my son
And him look at me like;
Daddy you the greatest, I wanna be just like you
I tell him; Be like me, but with a higher IQ
So he can cut the water cut fat [-]
And cut the water [-]
I bump my head a couple time's
Putting my hammer to the screw
But I fix my situation, what about [-] you
Swallong the simulating nigga's fake
Jealousy begins to generatethe bit of hate
It's [-] the wat it spreads all through the niggas face
Acting like his girlfriend slept with me
Now he got some shit to say
He recieved the tone of def from me, respectfully
Disrespecting me results in weaponry
Check your speed and all your [-]
Before you are left to bleed

[Hook:]
