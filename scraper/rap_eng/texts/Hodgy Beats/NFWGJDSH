[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Keep running your mouth and forget to think
Niggas running out of brink, money fucking shrink
Go in a bar to get a drink and your card extinct
Go in your car to fetch some cream, paper collard inc

Money's good when it's good, a nigga gotta think
Through a foggy hazed mental, eyes bothered pink
I'm young bitch, I ain't tryna worry 'bout my cash
I buy weed - a lil hash to keep in the stash
It's getting greener where the grass up under my ass
I take a drink from the flask cause y'all soft to ask
Strippers tithes on the glass another dollar pass
Either she's with me then make it last or I'm leaving fast
I'm on my dick bitch fuck what you're verbalizing
I'm rolling hemp getting higher to the horizon
See pretty women around the world and all of them smiling
They wanna see just a peek of America's idol

[Hook]
People wanna known how I feel about a lot of shit
But I never give, information to these motherfuckers
Big blunts - rotation, I ain't steady hating on another sucka
I put that on my brother's mother
I put that on my mother's mother
I put that on my cousin's mother
This is for all my mother lovers
Take care of yo family nigga
What material things aren't I bet you they can be nigga
I put that on my brother's mother
I put that on my mother's mother
I put that on my cousin's mother
This is for all you motherfuckers

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I'm wide awake - up, I stay up
Lazy niggas they lay up
I fuck my night and my day up
Smoking high nigga way up
I get chips do my lay ups
Replay some don't delay much
Get my paper p - paper, get get my paper p - paper
Weed in hotel rooms boxing the whole floor
Liquor is gone go and get me some more
Bitches with designer bags in couture
She know that I ain't from here bitch I'm on tour
London to Japan Australia and France
Go places people wish they had the chance
Blunts I face it be shaded like a lamp
Mellowhype stars from that Wolf Gang clan camp

[Hook]
