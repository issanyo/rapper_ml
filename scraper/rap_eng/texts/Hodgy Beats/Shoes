I got all of these tools, I feel like Bob the Builder
Which is I'm about to use
All of these tools
No degree from a college, not a part of your school
Pull up tardy for cool
[?] news
Don't want [?] I'm an artist I do this
On the block, I'm the new kid
Introduced to the bullshit
[?] foolish
Fool around with the coolest
Cooling I'm cooling down
From ice to the [?]
I used to be nice, now I'm a nuisance
Why do I have an account to check all of these swooshes
Check imbalance amounts that don't amount to your two cents
I just [?] and walkthrough it
[?] I'm assuming somebody
[?] I'm truant, not the truest
Hit my hand after I do it
If I walked in someone else's shoes
I'd tie my laces
Try to pace myself while I'm climbing these acres
I make mistakes myself, final my destination
Journey in someone else's shoes
Stop in the park, I'm a blot in the dark
Got a long way to go
Life in a shopping cart
Life in this box of darkness
What kind of shoes are these?
Man I got them from wasteland
Didn't have a belt, put the laces around my waist band
I'm a pretty boy couple scars [?]
Suntan sundried like a raisin
I'm a new muse, museum mutation
MellowHype [?]
[?] blue faces
Dazed and confused say
I'm Grinch on Whoosday
Get it cream like Wu-Tang
[?] today
I got the juice though
Stay up out my Kool Aid
Come get it
I am unpredict, multi-faceted
Chris run with it
Hurdles, 210 tin foil
Custom fit [?] legit
Unplanned unanswered question
Comprehension [?]
I'm above the waist with it
Ankle socks in another man's shoes
A stranger blisters pop cause this ain't my shoe
Lace 'em tight, walking day and night
Through the darkness remaining light
New apartment I paint it white
Jesus said that's what my [?] is like
Welcome him in without [?]
Jesus
Would I take advantage of authority if I wore your cleats Jesus
I surrender to survival
Hand over the Bible
Extendo on the rifle
Christ no Jesus
I'm the flyest
My life ain't the pilot, it's the whole season
Oh Jesus
Hodgy wilding out for no reason
Cleaning, he washed up now and now we don't need him
Said he don't trust us now
Back and forth for the court
[?] backing out
He love his seed, he's about to tuck up now
What's up, his girl grieving, caught him cheating
Demeanor [?]
Cleats hurting my pinky toe
In someone else's shoes
Walking in someone else's shoes
Maybe God, maybe a stranger I never met
Maybe mine
Maybe I'm crazy, I just forget sometimes
