[Chorus: Ldog]
(Details, Details, Details)
Who, what, when, where, how, nigga, why?
(Details, bitch I need the details)
Who, what, when, where, how, nigga, why?
(Bitch, hit me wit’ the details)
Who, what, when, where, how, nigga, why?
(I need the details, I’m all about the details, yeah)
Who, what, when, where, how, nigga, why?
(I need the details, hit me wit’ the details, yeah)

[Verse 1: Hodgy]
Who be that creepin’ while my tea steepin’?
My wife be sleepin’, who she dreaming’ about?
Man I just got me a visa, citizen duality
I battle brutality, got it covered like canopy
Pistol cocked by the vanity, finally reaching sanity
Kill ‘em all for my family, hurt ‘em all for my family
Martin Luther on the balcony
Money stacks a book like The Alchemy
Where they do that at?
What they doin’ a rap? How they movin’ it back?
Hodgy, realize I’m the coolest cat
(Are you tired of proving that?)
I been to real to the fake
Pray I die in my thoughts before I wake
My soul, it take time to wake and bake
Who, what, when, why must I raise the stakes?
That [?] is beefin’ with a toothpick, bringing out my loose lip
The truth is I’m ruthless
Mind gone, time zone

[Chorus: Ldog]
Who, what, when, where, how, nigga, why?
(Details, bitch I need the details)
Who, what, when, where, how, nigga, why?
(Bitch, hit me wit’ the details)
Who, what, when, where, how, nigga, why?
(I need the details, I’m all about the details, yeah)
Who, what, when, where, how, nigga, why?
(I need the details, hit me wit’ the details, yeah)

[Ad Lib: Left Brain]
Aye nigga, tell me who the fuck did that shit, where they at?
That’s all I wanna know, I don’t care, where they at nigga?
Where they at? Yo, Ay yo, g-

[Verse 2: Left Brain]
Where the fuck niggas at? Where the fuck are these guys?
I already know what happened, I don’t wanna know why
Imma pull up on ‘em niggas, imma let shots fly
Imma hit ‘em five times, Imma watch these niggas die

[Interlude: Left Brain & Ldog]
(gunshots)
That’s what the fuck you get nigga for fuckin’ wit’ us nigga!
Bi-! Bi-! Bitch ass nigga! ‘Fuck outta here nigga, let’s go
It’s what you fucking get, you shouldn’t be sayin’ shit nigga
This nigga fucked up

[Verse 3: Ldog]
Let’s go, let’s go
Time to get the fuck up outta here, let’s go
Who these random niggas is? I don’t know
Where they came from
How they got here, I don’t know
All I know is they was talkin’ shit, what happened?
Don’t ask me man, hey, ‘cause I ain’t seen shit
Why you worried about us? Worry ‘bout your click
When it’s time to ball, your whole team on the bench
You niggas sweatin’ off a warm up
By score, here’s the details, you ran the score up
Y’all got two, we lost count, we had too much
So you can call it off, we got way more than enough
Sike dog, we need more, we need it all
What’s the details? Tell me
Aye I’m fixing to creep call, fall through
Steppin’ over niggas like they teed off
If you ain’t talking money bitch
Ain’t a chance imma fixing to fuck wit’ you

[Chorus: Ldog]
(Details, bitch I need the details)
Who, what, when, where, how, nigga, why?
(I need the details, hit me wit’ the details, aye)
Who, what, when, where, how, nigga, why?
(I need the details, I’m all about the details, yeah)
Who, what, when, where, how, nigga, why?
(I need the details, bitch hit me wit’ them details, aye)

[Outro: Ldog]
(Details, bitch I need the details)
(I need the details, hit me wit’ the details, aye)
(I need the details, I’m all about the details, yeah)
(I need the details, bitch hit me wit’ them details, aye)
