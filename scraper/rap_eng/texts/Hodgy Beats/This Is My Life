[Intro]

Is this thing on?
Alright, cool

[Verse 1]

Three years ago, I was a freshman
Coming in the high school with game like a veteran
Knew how to dot my eyes good with letters in
Girls had my name on the left side of their letterman's
And, yeah I had a little fee
What she didn't know was that I had about three
I wouldn't go to them, nigga they come to me
Hodgy Beats was steppin' on those wannabes
Niggas would copy, girls would jock me
They though I was cocky, lil' nigga not even a jocky
Skinny niggas ride, fuck being stocky
The haters I was chalkin', but they wouldn't stop me
But foolin' when I wanted to, foolin' when I wanted to
Doin' what I wanted to, they droolin' when I'm comin' through
When the game fronting that's not gon' stop from doing what I wanna do I do what I wanna do

[Hook]

This is my life, I'm gonna live it right, gonna live it right
This is my past, let you see through it just like glass, just like glass
This is my life, I'm gonna live it right, gonna live it right
This is my past, let you see through it just like glass, this is my life

[Verse 2]

This here Hodgy Q, and he's a rapper
He'll crap right on your lap leave your spot with laughter
Break niggas down on the fact
And when they wanted to act nuts he backed it up
But couldn't keep his tracks up
Remember that day, on that bus? when he cussed him out?
When they thought he roughed it out?
Kids were watching like they were scouts
He's special in my eyes, but niggas had a doubt
His girl told him that until she found out
He had another chick, house and a couch with swagger in the mouth
She went down south
He had a lil' ring around his finger, a girlfriend and a spouse
So he wasn’t committed to a youngful commitment
She wasn’t with it
So he told her to get it
Gone, he ain't wrong
She got left right where she belong
And that's a true story

[Hook]

This is my life, Im gonna live it right, gonna live it right
This is my past, let you see through it just like glass, just like glass
This is my life, Im gonna live it right, gonna live it right
This is my past, let you see through it just like glass, this is my life
