[Hook: Hodgy Beat]
That Wise and LaKid, I've seen my big homies and all the shit that they did
Nigga that Wise and LaKid, Wise and LaKid, Shoot my homie over a discussion; ain't that a bitch?
Nigga that Wise and LaKid, Wise and LaKid, said I've seen my big homies and all the shit that they did
Nigga that  Wise and LaKid,  Wise and LaKid, Shoot my best friend over a plate of ribs,  Wise and LaKid

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
If this the Devil's work, why do I work for myself?
We're both young niggas in training, break off like an ice shell
My big homies explain how we inherit the life of bad health
Hitting clubs, maintaining wages, strip clubs: throw money on stages
We homies, brothers more so nigga, word to my torso
First we hit a lick then count it at grandma's bringing in four loads
Keys don't give accessibility, you're going to need a door code
You can see my mind going, I take off my sombrero
Robbing niggas then we riding through the night like Zorro
It's hot, the feds on patrol; we're the causes of this like Toro
Up my street cred borough, get the D done, cleaning thorough
If we murk somebody, make sure the job is paying plural
Cause my baby-momma pregnant, she's going to need an epidural
That's why I'm losing weight on the block, these fucking rocks spread intramural
Looking at my hands and all this dirt, need a clean shave and a shirt yo
Tucking handguns under Carhartt, front to me you might get hurt, yo

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I didn't find love at home, so I was out with my homies
Would stick him for his bologna, if one'd get caught they don't know me
Take one for the team and hold it, 40 days and nights like he Moses
Get out and back to the motive, we carried the streets on our shoulders
Tombs and RPG explosives, laundering money through the shop
Hoping the government won't notice if dimes are dropped and nines get popped
Hallow tips burn funeral service, mama wondered what he did to deserve this
Only one life in each person, excursions at Earth's surface
Who am I? I'm an animal, biodegraded tangible
Nigga my cleaning's annual, try me and meet my hammer too
In the projects I ran the school, in the projects push and the pull
We're just objects seraned and cooled and placed in a box
Release a G then arrest him, rotation switching the locks
Probation: report to the cops, has a wrist brace like a stopwatch
Rottweilers in front on the lot, just passed this cutthroat like Ox
Watching Jamaica disappoint me, I'm smoking and pouring scotch
