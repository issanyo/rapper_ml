We outta control, it's outta control
We outta control, it's outta control

[Hook: Both]
It's outta control, off the chain we animals
Fangs is out, get that dough
Can't go back, it's outta control

[Verse 1: M.E.D.]
Ease back we on, fly so she on
That shit we on, raw opium
Swag out space like Obi Wan's
Behave this tazer born to stun
(We major) if and with buts
Come to the womb just bring extra blunts
We next to none, get money, count it up
Not from Hawaii still we Maui'd up
(Trust me), flow tough like buffalo tusk
She on bumper like 5 o'clock rush
No such thing as suck, I succeed
Most my friends are dead or parolees
Like Barry White on the low key
Beat tape, writing rhymes with a 40
Navigate with Adobe
On the streets name her weight, you light as a snow pea
Only for real niggas, and shorties
Don't turn it down when you see the police

[Hook]
It's outta control, off the chain we animals
Fangs is out, get that dough
Can't go back, it's outta control
It's outta control, off the chain we animals
Beats that bang, dangerous flows
Ask girls in the front row, they know

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Hodgy Beats I'm off my space shuttle
I touch down to Earth like my team huddles
No troubles we splash in a mud puddle
Hoes suck dick I just say they blow bubbles
Cherry pop at the pit stop
Yeah my shit's hot, gridlock, ask your bitch shop
I'm young not knowing when will the kid stop
Maybe when a golden Rolex is my fucking wristwatch
That's some cliche words and they call me Hip Hop
This ain't Hip Hop bitch, I'm more Kid Rock
Rock and roll, throw rocks with a troll
This game I control, middle finger to patrols
In the wilderness I hinder hits
Niggas talk but can't walk like their shins got splints
No whip but my window tints on my glasses
Catch up molasses I'm outta control, yeah
Wolf Gang

[Hook]
