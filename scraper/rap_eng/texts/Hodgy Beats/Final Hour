[Hook: Hodgy]
Niggas riding waves and riding benches
Niggas riding waves and riding benches
Take the [drugs] out my system, replace 'em with prisms
I'm sick, it's momentous, I'm seeing symptoms
Symptoms pimping records, ain't no sipping
I been smoking hail Mary's, fuck the niches
While these niggas riding waves and riding bitches
Niggas riding waves and riding bitches

[Verse 1: Hodgy]
Find me on my final hour being a bachelor
I'm taking hip-hop in the hand
And my plan is to love and look after her
My duty's to kill, causing havoc massacres
Extra protection man, wrap it up
I'm still alive cause I got that drive to crash and kill all the passengers
Nigga fuck off and walk away afterwards

[Break: Hodgy]
Fresher than that ain't nobody
No, no, no, no
Fresher than that ain't nobody
No, no, no
Fresher than that ain't nobody
No, no, no, no

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
Fuck it bring in the noise
Now we're bringing the noise
I'm singing with the joy while they call in the boys
Can't call on the man so they call on the boy
You can't call your boys they took off and deployed
Unloyal, turmoil, two things I avoid
Two things I destroy (destroy)
I cut that shit out like it sat in my chair, I'm a barber at Floyd's
Cut me out then I'm coming back just like a keloid
I'm observing like I'm the fly on the wall nigga, Pink Floyd

[Break: Hodgy]
Temptation on a highway, on a highway
No hesitation
If there's an issue I could pull up in your driveway
You ain't a starter nigga

[Hook: Hodgy]

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Hodgy, tell them niggas shut up nigga
Big shoe, better put your one up nigga
If you ain't got your one up nigga
It's all good, you better put your gun up nigga
Take that, t-t-t-take that
C-c-cock back and every time we gotta clap back
And we gotta do it like we surfing and we running on an express train
Like we running on that Amtrak
I got so much money
While you niggas buy cars, I just buy up the NASDAQ
Relapse back to and I use the wrong niggas like I really flashback
And then I, I make 'em feel it again, until I heal 'em again it's getting realer again
We got 'em frustrated, till we open the floodgate, that's how I kill 'em again
Hope you niggas reading, the sign's up
Take a look my niggas, open your blinds up
Got a little kush you could grind up
With a new bad bitch and she a one of a kind slut
Rockin' the town
Padlock fucker, I be locking it down
Bad block, fucker I be shuttin' you down
In an ascot nigga you can give me my crown (Give me my shit)
When you got no chance, every time we come, then you must control shit
And we always flatline every thing, you know we on a roll bitch
Little mama got her hand out, let me give you something you could hold quick
Cause you might need help when your girl wanna grab on my whole dick

[Hodgy]
No preparations on the highway
If there's a destination, I'm gon' pull up in your driveway
You ain't a starter nigga

[Hook: Hodgy]

[Verse 4: Hodgy]
We don't fall for temptation (No)
Contemplating hesitation
We call on experiences, wishing for some inspiration
I'm not waiting in line, nigga time to wait in
A promised haven
I'm Franklin in GTA when I'm going instantly insane
I end up busted or wasted
I'd rather be wasted than busted though
She bust it open when she touch her toes
Touch me, I'ma rupture
Electrocute her like a tremolo
I got my spoon in her gumbo bowl
Smoking super bowl at the rose bowl cause I told ya smoke
Your opinion's irrelevant
I am the room, I stepped into the elephant
Money first nigga, the pussy the predicate
Pussy the antonym, you
It's fucking relevant, get this shit, fuck we're celibate
Fuck it then sell it quick
I just be relishing, moving to save you and you the embarrassment
I'm drawing back to the source, my immediate heritage
Who is gonna stop me?
What the main fucking question is

[Outro: Hodgy]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Fuck what they say, way today
I'm on my way, way, way
