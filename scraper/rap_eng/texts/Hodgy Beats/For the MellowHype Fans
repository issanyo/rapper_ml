[Intro: Hodgy]

[Verse 1: Hodgy]
I like to share it with my motherfuckin' niggas
So I smoke [?] with my motherfuckin' niggas
Mary Jane campaign triple [?] smoke it bigger
Roll a cigar, not a Swisher Sweet
Such a hit of leaf
Rolled in a pot of heat, niggas know I got it
Selling [?] profit, smoking on your wallet
Pulling money out a socket tryna test for a deposit
Cloning meds in my closet, niggas know I got it
And it's prescribed by a doctor, niggas know I'm proper
I travel places, globetrotter selling gold Whoppers
To the soul shoppers over salt waters
Money never gobstopper, Mary Jane her father
Bloody in the mirror with the lights out
Study with your [?]
I'm a connect four, my flesh raw
Niggas hope to connect [?] but their set's soft

[Chorus: Hodgy]
First I cop the weed, so much purple brown
Get the papers and the grinder, break the marijuana down
Roll the marijuana perfect, puff and pass the joint around
Nigga pass the joint around, nigga pass the joint around
First I cop the weed, so much purple brown
Get the papers and the grinder, break the marijuana down
Roll the marijuana perfect, puff and pass the joint around
Nigga pass the joint around, nigga pass the joint around

[Post-Chorus: Hodgy]
And I'm rolling up, niggas know I'm smoking
And I'm smoking up, niggas know we're smoking

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
I could survive without liquor
Put some weed in a Swisher
I'ma have to call my motherfuckin' bitch up
Know we got it for the right price
A nigga smoke flight
Merican 77 September 11th
Each [?] defected, infect by piss if it's tested
[?] shelter but me I'm rolling hempsworth
I'm in the air, blimp words
Put the lighter in the center extend verbs
People claim that it's a drug, well I defend herbs
It isn't like drinking liquor, taking hits of sherm
Money green, burner clean, let the Swish burn
My hundreds green, nuggets green, get some [?] turns

[Chorus: Hodgy]
First I cop the weed, so much purple brown
Get the papers and the grinder, break the marijuana down
Roll the marijuana perfect, puff and pass the joint around
Nigga pass the joint around, nigga pass the joint around
First I cop the weed, so much purple brown
Get the papers and the grinder, break the marijuana down
Roll the marijuana perfect, puff and pass the joint around
Nigga pass the joint around, nigga pass the joint around

[Post-Chorus: Hodgy]
And I'm rolling up, niggas know I'm smoking
And I'm smoking up, niggas know we're smoking
And I'm rolling up, niggas know I'm smoking
And I'm smoking up, niggas know we're smoking

[Interlude: Hodgy]
MellowHype bout this bitch nigga
Smoke like a motherfuckin' train nigga
Fuck cancer nigga, I'm smoking
(And I'm rolling up, niggas know I'm smoking)

[Chorus: Hodgy]
First I cop the weed, so much purple brown
Get the papers and the grinder, break the marijuana down
Roll the marijuana perfect, puff and pass the joint around
Nigga pass the joint around, nigga pass the joint around
First I cop the weed, so much purple brown
Get the papers and the grinder, break the marijuana down
Roll the marijuana perfect, puff and pass the joint around
Nigga pass the joint around, nigga pass the joint around

[Outro]
