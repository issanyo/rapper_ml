[Intro]
Call me if you got a problem
You could call me if you got a problem
Call me if you got a problem
You could call me if you got a problem

[Hook]
You could call me if you got a problem
Oh you faithful, oh you grateful
You could call me if you got a problem
What we gon' do, what we gon' do, what we gon' do
We, we, we gon' talk it out, talk it out
(Talk it out, talk it out, talk it out, talk it out)
If you got a problem (Talk it out, yeah)
I'll walk through it with you
I'll go through it with you
We gon' talk it out

[Verse 1]
I heard you're struggling close but such a long yard
When you're bagging groceries at Barnes & Long John's
You're bagging Lucky Charms
Luck ran away, your charm's gone
Self-incrimination, self-hatred
You tell yourself you can't make it
You're deflated, the harm's done
You need patience running away to San Diego karma
Destined for greatness, don't be mistaken
Cause if you miss while you're swinging, somebody else'll take it
Hit it then run the bases on a daily basis
Straight to first base, second, third, home plate it
Just call me when you need some motivation
It's motivating to me, that's my motive ain't it
I got my umbrella God, I know it's close to raining
You see me falling off sometimes when I'm supposed to be training
Supposed to be, when I'm supposed to be training
You see me falling off
I'll call on God and I'll explain it

[Hook]
You could call me if you got a problem
Oh you faithful, oh you grateful
You could call me if you got a problem
What we gon' do, what we gon' do, what we gon' do
We, we, we gon' talk it out, talk it out
(Talk it out, talk it out, talk it out, talk it out)
If you got a problem (Talk it out, yeah)
I'll walk through it with you
I'll go through it with you
We gon' talk it out

[Verse 2]
You just lost your best friend, they just went to heaven
Got caught in a dead end, ran into a dead end
Married to the M-O-B, they ain't show up to your wedding
All that bullshit you said went
Took your hood credit, your chain, and your weapon
You still rocking your bandana, ain't you
You running them streets by yourself, ain't you
You think you invincible cause how niggas raised you
And by the night if they don't catch you, be grateful, they plot to paint you
Your girlfriend's worried bout you, she call you like every thirty minutes
Knowing you doing dirt digging holes and you might be buried in it
Rather be a man than stand your ground and say you served and timid
That's what matters the most
They approach you with the toast and finish
Rest in peace on the streets, it's a rivalry
When I die get high for me, man please don't cry for me
I don't see a future down the street is all that I can see
They pulling up in their whip for revenge, no apologies

[Hook]
You could call me if you got a problem
Oh you faithful, oh you grateful
You could call me if you got a problem
What we gon' do, what we gon' do, what we gon' do
We, we, we gon' talk it out, talk it out
(Talk it out, talk it out, talk it out, talk it out)
If you got a problem (Talk it out, yeah)
I'll walk through it with you
I'll go through it with you
We gon' talk it out
