[Intro]
I'ma kill the whole joint, one hit
Shout out Doms, shout out Vic
All my niggas rock, rock

[Verse]
They say Hodgy, he's a heated gent
Which ever way you cut him, he gon' bleed defensively
All this type of shit, it needs prevention
Maybe it's time for him to reinvent
Is he still making hitters?
The last I heard he had a baby on the way
I ain't heard from the nigga in a while
Every time I see him, he never smiles
I went to one of his shows before he front flipped in the crowd, wow
See Hodgy, he's really compulsive
It's like [?] completed emotion
Out of thin air, it's apparent he's defeated and broken
Trying to compare denar to a slot in the token
Coming from dropping out of college to popping them potions
And then my doctor called me, told me to stop in slow motion
Somebody thought about me drowning in a sea-less ocean
Life, it keep on rolling and I keep on smoking

[hook]
Can we get higher?
(And i'ma light this spliff for everybody that's ever been here for me)
Everybody get higher
(I appreciate each and every single one of y'all for having my back)
I just want to get higher
(You know you held me down through a lot of shit, you know what I'm saying so I'm always gonna have y'all back)
Light an L on fire
(That unconditional love, for you)

This one is for you

[Verse 2]
I react off instinct, never really thought about it
Thank you to those who I boxed it in and then fought it out with
Came through and showed love when I was down they never doubted
They know the road rough ain't got time to change your outfit
Pants, shoes, sneakers, of course
I can't find the other pair, I don't believe it
Sometimes I'm blinded by my anger and I feel no remorse
I bottle up and explode instead of taking it to the source
Full throttle on all you ho niggas I reach to the force
I'm a Sour Patch Kid, you niggas sweet like a s'mores
And I'm yelling on these records til I'm hoarse
You can hear it in my voice, bitch I don't really have a choice
I do this for my people with no voice
For my niggas locked up by the police
They shelfing niggas boxed up, he was a dope boy
Spending life behind bars, there's no hope for him

[Hook]
