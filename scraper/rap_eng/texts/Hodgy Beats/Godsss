[Verse1: Hodgy Beats]

(eh...)

If you are sober now, you should fuckin' roll the loud
I'm just a smoker proud to be, so I smoke a cloud
Its over cast, I'm home at last
Pulled the whip into the drive way, CBDs are not the high way
So I light it on the highway, Mary J likes it my way, usher
I roll the crush inside the stuff, lookin' like Badu
Can't no body be like Hodgy, oh my gosh Higashi Miyagi
In a lex fuck Maserati and a Bugatti (Eeeh!)
I wouldn't buy it if I had it (had it)
Money is a magnet, watch they strait jack it, they ratchet
Dig in your back kits, take your wallet and your chap stick
Left you no cash now your chaps lipped
You fucked around and lost to be the boss in fucking cost nigga (Brroooop)

[Hook]
I don't trust a bitch but Mary Jane x2 (roll up) (Yea!)
They comin' after ya' kids, whips and chains (hold up)
I don't trust a bitch but Mary Jane x3 (roll up) (Yea!)
They comin' after ya' kids, whips and chains (hold up)
I don't trust a bitch but Mary Jane (roll up)

[Verse2: Hodgy Beats]

Mari...juana, smokin', ganja (yeh)
Today and ma√±ana, you can bet your bottom dolla'
You pop collars, I cop flowers strait from the plant
Do the face hunger dance, cause bitch I got the munchies
I ain't rollin' on nothing, simply rolling up something
Smokin' up puffin', blow ya' fuckin' house down
I'm stingy with my nuggets, while in glass jar buckets
You may not fucks with, none of it when I come in town
I let you get a wiff, no piff'
Green relish for the bucks it won't be trade it like, Monta Ellis (Yea'!)
I light it up as they watch
Blow the smoke, I know they smell it
I don't trust none of you bitches, I ain't bein' selfish

[Hook]
I don't trust a bitch but Mary Jane x2 (roll up) (Yea!)
They comin' after ya' kids, whips and chains (hold up)
I don't trust a bitch but Mary Jane (roll up!)
