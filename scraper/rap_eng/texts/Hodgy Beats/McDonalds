[Intro]
I got a brain I gotta think
Blue is purple and purple is pink
I gotta a brain I gotta think
Spilling this ink as I'm off of this drink

[Hodgy Beats]
I'm twisted, uplifted
Grey goose blifted, head dose and finger itchin'
Mind twitchin' eyes flickerin'
I'm on the mission to the counter I'm gettin'
More lickerin, in this system
Tried to pour it in my mouth but I missed it
No hang overs for tomorrow, I don't get sick
But this sick shit, I spit vicious
Ambitious ridiculous audacious
Suspicious malicious nutritious
Your's broken? Nigga fix it
Mine's cracked, lip stick
I'm cracked baking soda mixed with white girl
For the white girl you sniff it
Whiff this and get hit
To the new hot OF the lord Hodgy the new cop
With a Glock, clocked back and pop
Not a slop sprayer so the hater get shot
After while take a shot
Get me loose when I screw off the top, we rolling rock
Drinks on the rock like we on the dock
Cuttin' L's off the knock playing Xbox
While I'm in my socks rocking team blocks
Foxy like a fox, Chinchilla gorilla, this song knocks
I'm the king and  the beats the queen
Left Brain on the scene and countin' up the green
He the principle I'm the dean
There's plenty children between  slow-mo caffeine
