[Intro]
Yeah, it's not my fault this time
I'mma blame it on (You)
This song im making is especially for (You)

[Verse]
Yeah, you make me feel like I'm trash
Like I'm im failing and staying in the back of the class
I thought school was wack being cool was wack
And niggas thought I was cool, how cool is that?
I want you to feel my pain cause I'm out in the rain
But without pain I wasn't gon' gain
My hearts not broken it's more of a sprain
My life ain't a dance like I'm on soul train
My world turned black, inverted cocaine
I can not explain, hopping on the next plane
6:45 in a 745
Seven shorties live and they ready for the ride
We live to survive or we living to die
Smoke 'til we high, we lose then we gone fly
Get up like cheddar and get it together
Get it now or never so you can hold it forever

[Hook]
My Odd Future
I gotta get it right now, I gotta get it right now
My Odd Future
I gotta right these lyrics down, I gotta use this paper right now
My Odd Future
I gotta get it right now, I gotta use this paper right now
My Odd Future
I gotta write these lyrics down, spit it, how this shit sound?
