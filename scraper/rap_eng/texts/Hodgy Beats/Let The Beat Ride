TJ Productions
Take it easy, man
Believe me, man
OF, yeah, no

[Verse 1]
I'm in the 626 passing [?]
Turn me up on the mic and cut down the stereo
So when we ride, the homies get [?]
Drive by material, niggas driving very slow
They can't tell me nothing like Kanye
I ball like Kwame
My arm around another cat's Beyonce
If I'm Jay-Z, she swear to be Beyonce
I listen to my mother, don't care what my aunt say
Can't drive the Hum-v so I'm cruising in the [?]
Parked by Robertson boulevard, Bimmer [?]
Pull a Swisher out my creased cargo
Broke in the pocket, can't feel my lent
Just got a ticket, cops saying take off my tints
Last week they booked me and took fingerprints
It don't matter what note the singer hits
You can't see eye to eye [?] closer [?]

[Hook]
My life is a movie, this is how the story goes
Chocolate on the inside like an uh-oh Oreo
Drama never leave, watch me like the Maury show
Got something on my hip so I don't have to worry, yo
My life is a movie, this is how the story goes
Chocolate on the inside like an uh-oh Oreo
Drama never leave, watch me like the Maury show
Got something on my hip so I don't have to worry, yo

[Verse 2]
If you paint your face, I'm clowning
Girls get down, down, and they drowning
I'm all about my verbs so I'm [?]
[?]
Call me on the phone and get stuck
Girl you out of luck
You ran up on me and got hit with a hockey puck
Supersized, the size of super
My mind is super
I'm on the rise and you
Wasting your time tryna defeat me
I'ma back off and you can call it retreating
Hypebeasting, [?]
They cop my swag and Hodgy Beats love it
Get ready for [?]
I'ma be rocking it and you're not
I'ma be rocking it, get ready for [?]
We too hot and we cannot stop

[Hook]
My life is a movie, this is how the story goes
Chocolate on the inside like an uh-oh Oreo
Drama never leave, watch me like the Maury show
Got something on my hip so I don't have to worry, yo
My life is a movie, this is how the story goes
Chocolate on the inside like an uh-oh Oreo
Drama never leave, watch me like the Maury show
Got something on my hip so I don't have to worry, yo
