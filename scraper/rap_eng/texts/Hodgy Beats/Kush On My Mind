[Verse 1]
You may know it as kush, my niggas call it mush
The cats down south light up that George Bush
It's what they saying when I push
I'm so legit with it, buyers keep it on the hush
Paper, paper, stack it like books
Even Stevie Wonder had to look
I got these other dealers shook because I'm making more money than them
And I ain't even gotta cook
With that baking soda, my nigga, we taking over
Odd Future high, never pissing out the sober
You smell the odor
Got my grandmother looking over her 70 year old shoulder
Hotboxing in the rover
Til the cops look and flash their sirens and tell me to hold up
They smell it in the morning like Folgers
I got kush in folder, yeah she smoking nigga

[Hook]
Kush on my mind, I blow it all the time
Kush on my mind, I blow it all the time
Kush-Kush on my mind, I blow it all the time
Kush-Kush on my mind, I blow it all the
Kush on my mind, I blow it all the time
Kush-Kush on my mind, I blow it all the time
Kush-Kush on my mind, I blow it all the time
Kush-Kush on my mind, I blow it all the time

[Verse 2]
I'm pushing pure green and stupid purple
So gone niggas feeling all goofy like Urkel
The green got you derpy
Got you going in circles as if I threw spiral Nerf ball
Hurt y'all
Sling that half in the Charger and skert off
Never on that dirt dog
That green ain't even work, haw
Purple dragon in a purple wagon
Purple love, purple sex, purple satin
Purple english, green latin
Yes he's slinging plus he's rapping
Odd Future with green people laughing
Inhale once, you gonna be passing, green gassing
I sling to get by, light up we gon fly
Get high, never give, never die

[Hook]
Kush on my mind, I blow it all the time
Kush on my mind, I blow it all the time
Kush-Kush on my mind, I blow it all the time
Kush-Kush on my mind, I blow it all the
Kush on my mind, I blow it all the time
Kush-Kush on my mind, I blow it all the time
Kush-Kush on my mind, I blow it all the time
Kush-Kush on my mind, I blow it all the time
