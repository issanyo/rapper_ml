[Intro: Duckwrth]
Yeah, yeah, yeah[?]
First tech, yeah
Ru on the beat

[Hook: Duckwrth]
Look at the time
Look at the place
Rolling down Hollywood
All I see is space
All I see is stars
All I see is space
I'm gonna need my start bitch
Gimme my space

Look at the time
Look at the place
Rolling down Hollywood
All I see is space
All I see is stars
All I see is space
I'm gonna need my start bitch
Gimme my space

[Verse 1: Duckwrth]
Didn't grow up in a safe hood
Didn't have no good father
Didn't grow up in the same hood
But the story had a same author
Then I heard about the clean water
All I wanted was a clean water
Heard that from Seen Carter
I mean Sean Carter
I mean Godfather
I mean more permanent than a black marker
On a white school board
Or a light skinned girl with the bouncy curls
Get her puss so wet
Bring her bouncy roll and a sponge
(God damn that's wet)
Take a dip up in the river we can really have fun
Backstroke, breath stroke, more with the tongue
Hi-hat flow with a nice snare drum
Say hi-hat flow with a hook on the run

[Hook: Duckwrth]
Look at the time
Look at the place
Rolling down Hollywood
All I see is space
All I see is stars
All I see is space
I'm gonna need my start bitch
Gimme my space

Look at the time
Look at the place
Rolling down Hollywood
All I see is space
All I see is stars
All I see is space
I'm gonna need my start bitch
(Huh) Gimme my space

[Bridge: Hodgy Beats]
Measure Juno
Black planet, black space
(I’m trying to leave the Earth and this world is a rat race)
I’m going to Pluto
(I walk my poodle, ruled the street though[?])
What do we know
Nigga, what do we know (we know, we know, we know)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Sitting in the world like a corn-a-cob
Kernel pop’d
Heartbreak beats, but still born to rob
Pulled through, rose stones when i fornicat’
Pulling up, blowing horns in a foreign drive (yeah)
Dream machine like an orange pop
Pop-up ground hogs, kinda tour’d a lot
Shit all my thoughts in a port-a-pop
Podcast, dreamcast, all a load of God
(Thank Jesus) I got ‘em questioning me like religiously
(Are you questioning me right now)
Is is a game and I’m fetchin’ to killing
I’m killing shit call me da Riddick
How did I do it so easy it doesn’t look cuzzin’ girl holding my milkshake
I trip out on the way to the moon, have a nice trip man
Miss Frizzin’ the field trip

[Hook: Duckwrth]
Look at the time
Look at the place
Rolling down Hollywood
All I see is space
All I see is stars
All I see is space
I'm gonna need my start bitch
Gimme my space (1, 2, 3)

Look at the time
Look at the place
Rolling down Hollywood
All I see is space
All I see is stars
All I see is space
I'm gonna need my start bitch
(Huh) Gimme my space

[Outro]
Yeah, y-y-yeah
