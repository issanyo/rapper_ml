[Intro]

[Verse 1: Tech$ Finesse]
Yo'
Shoutout to that bitch who gave me sloppy top
Bobby Sox
I achieve, been﻿ worshiped more than a higher priest
I'm the closest to a god since his life expired B
Try me and these pliers will meet your entire cheek
Hear these words of wisdom from me who's inspiring
Show no mercy I'm hurting the, surgically committing burglaries perfectly waiting on a god to murder me
No ones fucking with this lyrically trained mercenary
I spit mercury purposely burning shit to a 3rd degree
Call me the Micro-fiend
Making light MCs﻿ overdose off of Lipozenes
The Odd Wolf in the Future spittin' micro beams

[Bridge]
Its Tech$ Finesse Yo
I'm here now
I was gone for three months but I'm here now
I'm back on my grind. (x2)

[Verse 2: Tech$ Finesse]
Through your ears, thoughts way darker than the psycho street
My opponents get treated like a nice cuisine
Slice in 3, then i devour them entirely
Laughing at the irony, while I'm defying the laws of society hanging animals from an iron leash
Haha I get on the mic and the track﻿ explodes, hand grenade
Here Shade is to end your masquerade I make raps baked, homemade I took your girl she came to my house one day
500 characters remaining, most of these raps are shaming, my﻿ ears and eyes flaming, what exactly are they gaining, a masterpiece I am painting, it's almost like a van goh
Yours was made in Japan though, falls apart you should re-plan yo'
Words I can't understand so
You keep your rhymes to a minimal,﻿ kill you with a syllable
Okay I'm not a criminal, no need to get biblical, don't even need to rap it, just created the visual

[Outro: Hodgy Beats]
