[Verse 1]
Uh
She say my stars are in alignment
I told her they'll be aligned once I finished my assignment
My mood changing like the climate
I got rid of the baby mama drama then I went found me a goddess
Standing for what I believe in like Louis Johnson
Howling at the moon chase the horizon
Don't believe in friendships, only fellowships, like I'm Amish
Higashi's a free soul nigga fuck a bondage
I put the nail in the coffin and then I polish
Your words I'll make you swallow it
Hodgy's being awarded like he's capturing the wanted
My demeanor is horror haunted
I seen the hoes get no responses
Sprite on [?] my flow's the correspondent
I pray to god for strength before I make a promise
He didn't reply to me right away
But he relayed that I got this
I've told you zucchini that I will squash it
But I just
Had to introduce them to the Aaahh!!! Real Monsters
They play like they black, faces waving flags, blanca
I'm ready for war, bitch I'm a suicide bomber
In the hummer with the turret
Dying in vain and honor
Kicking flows with Guatemalans in my chakras[?]
I had to double up '07 like entendres
And in the genre, I'm eating like an anaconda
Killing Hutus, you too, Hotel Rwanda
Only mobsters eat lasagna
Bitch [??]
Bringing Miami heat not the the Sauna
I spit the heat like a serrano
Vibrations in my Adams apple and Yolanda[?]
I stop dripping syrup pancake in that Aunt Jemima
I only time out when my time's up
I let it burn marijuana, Mary Jane said no more drama
I'm number 8 the most valuable player Black Mamba

[Verse 2]
Like the sample, I get the last laugh then play the congas
I got the drive of a Zonda
But I'm in the hood, five deep with my niggas
Still tipping the Honda
Bubbling thoughts like when you open a Shasta
Middle finger out the window to the cops and impostors
I'm sick in my head, sick with them words, need to talk to a doctor
Been dreaming imma top them with them choppers
Your children should be fostered, cuz pretty soon they'll be missing a father
Crank the volume, going harder than niggas on they albums
You focused on your TBT I'm focused on the outcome
If X marks the spot I'm thinking Malcolm
I'm flyer than an eagle or a falcon nigga how come
People sleeping on him speaking evil when the doubt him
Turn around pat him on the back and claim that they proud of him
They say the best man would bring the worst out of them
I hit the ground running, they crawl before they walk, then they learn how to run

[Outro]
Never ever in my life would I ever let a motherfucker tell me never, a lie
You know what I'm saying, if you're living at your momma's house and you're like 20-something, it's about time you get out that motherfucker don't you think?
I'm not comparing you to me or nothing, but like, if you're above 30, and you're living with your daddy nigga, you might as well stay there, there's a reason why you're there, motherfucker
