[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I've been drunk before
What are you drinking tonight
That tiki punch to pour
I'm getting my money right
Dirty as Harry as Sprite
Having the time of my life
Not focused on problematic static
Reach for higher heights
Man you loving it
Black arm, black face
She back door, this black dick
I'm macking on the mattress
It's a fact when I go I'm coming back with
More ratchets, more alcohol
More glasses, more [?]
I'm Michael Jordan [?]
Her hopes up, don't doubt me

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
People worry bout what you have im the [?]
(A beast on that shit)
Screwed up children turned out bad as adults
Laugh at assault, my bad that's my fault
(A beast on that shit)
Throw me a little slab and some salt
(A beast on that shit)
The freak of nature smoking sheets of paper, let me rap
(A beast on that shit)
I save the beef for later, I'm under heat I'm layered
The layer you entered into is mine to spare
(A beast on that shit)
Musically inclined, remind me to find a chair
(A beast on that shit)

Beast mode

[Verse 3: Hodgy Beats]
A nigga on beast when he parlay
Beastmode when he parties at the party
Feeling godly with a white girl [?]
Ace of spades, charades, [?]
You making Smirnoff, baby fill it in
Dim the lights, calm it down like a ritalin
I'm thinking bout the next time we gon' chill again
Shorty keep it real [?] as tough as my gorilla skin
I'm over the fire place, taxidermy
[?] til I hit, now it's home run derby
[?] girly
One of a kind like [?] there is no one [?]
Conceal the fire, feel the vibe
If you don't then release the [?]
They sleep in hammicks, [?]
Every day's a given, crazy as sinner
