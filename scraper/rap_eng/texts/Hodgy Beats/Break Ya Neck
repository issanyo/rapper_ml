[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I always get the hatred and it still means nothing
Thats why you're quiet as fuck handcuffing your bitch and mean mugging
Gym class coast license plate from Tennessee
She see me punching in the coast and she wanna come with me
Hung-a-ry like the race I raise, from a place with cooked meals
I'm over junk and sweets she want the Donald Trump beat
Pull up in the front seat
Coupe rum flow lyrically Mutombo
Bitches going in my mothers uhhh gum-bo
Odd Wolf lions at the circus hear a dumbo
Oseo Cardinal flying spark a seamer
Those are the Rust fires naturally happening in the winter
Higashi Miyagi gassing igniting it in the sprinter
Recycle smoke from the second hand passage
I carry weight like stress baggage
I fucking move the package across the Atlas
Drop the money off at the address
Pick your pocket, now you are packaged in the box
Jack shit, nigga
