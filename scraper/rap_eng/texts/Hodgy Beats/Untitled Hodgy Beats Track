[Verse 1]
I swallowed my pride, but it came back up
I fed you a lie, but it came back up
You were sincere to me and
I still claimed innocent, Because I’m ignorant
I played them all, like an instrument
Different producers is who I do my music business with
You say how much you’re doing, there’s no one there to witness it
You pitch a fit, I pitch to hit
Why can’t we forget this shit?
Man, I would do whatever you say
As long as you can move all these damn problems out my way
The weight is gaining on my shoulder like protein weight
No energizer booster, or daily vitamin
More like, gas green like Nitrogen
Beat the track ’till it’s red, blue, and black
Like Spiderman, pull out the fire man. (Damn)
Lines punch like a wire man
My verse expires in 3..2..1

[Hook x 2]
Enjoy, Enjoy, Exhale, Envoy
There’s envy in their voices, so they envoy
I’m walking with a dime
And she fine, and she shinin’, and she mine and no one elses

(Yeah)
