Verse (Ruben):
You remind me of
The kind of love from 96'
Put my lips on the TV screen
She was my favorite wet dream
Now I’m waking up
And I'm thinking of you all the time
Got this pounding in my chest ain't caught feelings quite like this

Pre:
Since I was 16
I would dream
Bout a girl ontop of me
White tee, nothing on underneath
I was 16, nowadays
Girl it’s you that got me crazy
I'm tryna find the words to explain

Chorus:
You got that something about you
You got that Rachel Green
Stuck in that teenage dream
You got that something about you
Wanna get inbetween
Think you know what I mean
My Rachel Green

Verse (Hodgy)
You got me thinking, I don't like to think
About what you like and think
I talk to you, you're sorta like my shrink
Your love is flowing down the drain, I'm like the sink, Sure you're something more than Mandy Moore, Sweet like candy, or my Drew Barrymore
Carry your bags, you carry more class, and it came before the last
Pouring more in your glass
Take a sip Mrs. Mendez-Eva
Be hommie-ballerina, baby mama-mia
She seem to be the one for me
But see that's all she seem to
Left for the sea, a speed of demons, too eager to meet you
Above average, you're classic, no Emma stone
Take you home, and eat you like a
Toblerone, We’re all alone, got you cheesin’ ùlike provolone Unitide, lovers arrive, the hope is gone
And you know what I fuckin' mean
Not another like my Rachel Green, yow
And you know what I fuckin’ mean
Not another like my Rachel Green

Chorus:
You got that something about you
You got that Rachel Green
Stuck in that teenage dream
You got that something about you
Wanna get inbetween
Think you know what I mean
My Rachel Green

Verse (Ruben): You remind me of, summertime in 98'
Took one look and I couldn't wait feeling like Ross on the first date Don't get me wrong
You’re my number one, don't you forget
You look so good that I reminisce, thinkin' bout what Rachel did

Pre:
She had style, got me wild, making all them FRIENDS smile
I'm like how could I get a girl so good?
Now it you, oh my god
I'm just so damn young and lucky, So baby when you touch me, I say…

Chorus:
You got that something about you
You got that Rachel Green
Stuck in that teenage dream
You got that something about you
Wanna get inbetween
Think you know what I mean
My Rachel Green
