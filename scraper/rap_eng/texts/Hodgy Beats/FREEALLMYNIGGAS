[Hook]
And that's how it is when you hustle
You don't want your family to struggle
So you out on the block past nine
There's dangers in the world and you're watchin'
Feds around the corner and they're clockin'
They catch a nigga doin' wrong, he doin' time
But in due time, I promise, man you'll be fine

[Bridge]
Just keep that in mind
My nigga, you'll be fine
We gon' wait until you get out
We gon' party so hard, tequila and lime
Sorry for bein' selfish, I'm just speakin' my mind
Nigga, if they catch a nigga doin' wrong, he doin' time
But in due time

[Verse]
Don't gas me up or I'll fill up, thoughts are screwed up like a Phillips
Doin' my push ups and chin ups, my six pack looks like it split up
Bitch I'm ballin' like a whiffle, wait until my niggas get out
We gon' celebrate, steaks and pork chops, have a pig out
My son's here, my mom's here, it's timeless, this time here
I daydream, no nightmares, on cloud 9, the sky's clear
I miss all my niggas locked up in the penitentiary
I miss your presence, I'm nostalgic with my memory
Document my words, treat it like a documentary
That's what niggas need, is extrasensory
Karma just arrived and I'm bringin' back what is meant for me
That fuckin' bitch, I hope she give it to me gently
If I ever go to jail I'm spittin' bars behind bars
Bars of open wounds, bars of healed up scars from a spar
I'm focused on you gettin' out, my nigga
Pray the judge'll let you out, my nigga, all faith, no doubts is with us

[Hook]
And that's how it is when you hustle
You don't want your family to struggle
So you out on the block past nine
There's dangers in the world and you're watchin'
Feds around the corner and they're clockin'
They catch a nigga doin' wrong, he doin' time
But in due time, I promise, man you'll be fine
