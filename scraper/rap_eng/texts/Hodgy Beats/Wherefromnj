[Intro]
There's a shooting outside nigga

[Verse 1]
Make sure you got your weapon on ya
Stand on ya two feet, if ya fall nigga steppin' on ya
Ain't that a bitch, if so I'm putting dresses on her
Concerned about what her first impression is gonna be
There's snakes that lay in the grass belong to me
I'm pushing syllabuls and [?] bumble bee
I high five myself, them haters living under me
I tape their mouth ear to ear, think what you wanna say humbly
Smoking humble leafs bitch I'm hungry
Took the cheese from the three blind mice
And made a grilled cheese for my son and me
I hold my heart in my palm, going hard when I'm home
Truth projected in song, my demons singing along
My demons singing along what I wrote in my songs
They be telling me I'm right when morally know I'm wrong
Have yet to be, just met my prime, MegaTron Decepticon
I'm in these streets, no need to check my credit line
And you could bet your dimes I'm one of the best to find

[Hook]
I'm in these streets, no need to check my credit line
I'm in these streets, no need to check my credit line
I'm in these streets, no need to check my credit line
I'm in these streets, no need to check my credit line

[Bridge]
Been in these streets nigga
Been in these streets nigga
I done been in these streets, nigga
No need to check my credit line

[Verse 2]
Yeah, knock on wood receive a splinter ayy
Colder than winter days
Stay out of the hood, that's what the winners say
You're stuck in the days, I just entered [?]
Never forfeit my courses, divorcing bullshit resources
Closets full of suits [?] losses
I rather be engolfed with flossing endorsements
I'm out of them trenches walking in marshes, training crossfit
Jesus jogging with me, multiple chains and crosses
I'm wiping off my soul like I stepped in dog shit
Cut my photo out of collages stored in Satan's garages
Water my seed until it blossoms
I'm eatining no sweet per say [?]
Rapping is easier than breather, I'm so proud
Mixing these two track recors with my vocal
Overly profound, better sign me to MoTown
Got a bag full of crystals all I'm missing is my old pal
There you go pal, Hodgy never sold out

[Hook]
I'm in these streets, no need to check my credit line
I'm in these streets, no need to check my credit line
I'm in these streets, no need to check my credit line
I'm in these streets, no need to check my credit line

[Bridge]
Been in these streets nigga
Been in these streets nigga
I done been in these streets, nigga
No need to check my credit line
