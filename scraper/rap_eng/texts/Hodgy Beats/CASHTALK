[Verse 1]
Niggas be screaming out YOLO
When I got your girl on my penis
She strung out on me like a yo-yo
Turn up on that junk food, calypso and Ho-Ho's
Niggas be soulless, I just let my soul go
I put that bitch shit to the side, man it's postponed
Life is a bitch, I watch her with no clothes on
Life man it goes on
I light the L, put it in the ozone
Smoking on that buff cause it's so strong
Reason why I go so hard, bitch I had to go home, go home
They be like Hodgy is that so?
That's so like Raven Samone
I'm my own best friend, Pumbaa and Timon
Black work on my body like a [?]

[Hook]
Never give up my independence
I know I kill every track, I see forensics
[?] if you can't see me it's tinted
Talk shit, you visit the dentist right after
Nigga survival of the fittest
Five AM touchdown and riding with me niggas
We so high, we need five fire extinguishers
Only the coolest down, can't pull us out

[Verse 2]
Said it was a forrest fire, said it was an arsonic
Gasoline on my attire
[?] my life and deal with the hardest shit
I got my seven senses, this shit is marvelous
I see my target, I aim at him with an [?]
I [?] shedding light through all of this darkedness
Tell these mark ass niggas that I'm a nigga with [?]
I figure you calling quits here
Sportmanship, yeah the baller is here
I don't draw on paper often
If there's a line then I'm drawing it here
I come to agreements but don't like yes men up in my ear
I skip to other regions and I be out like I wasn't even there
Ask me where I'm at, I'ma tell you that I'm in there
I got the astetics of balloons that's filled with helium

[Hook]
