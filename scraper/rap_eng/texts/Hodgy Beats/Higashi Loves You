[Hook]
Somebody loves you baby oh oh oh
Somebody loves you baby
(Repeat x3)

[Verse 1]
I feel the beat in my heart, other niggas pump their brains
Give me the dankest strain, I'll hop into my paper plane
Niggas run they mouth, shit I do the same
The only difference is I'm getting it bitches
Cause money, addiction, the addict is unrestricted to the
Life that I'm living, man, the life that I was given
Was purposely handed to me, I swear it was granted to me
I'm rose gold frozen my nigga, you granite to me, uh
That was what I call a fun time punch line
With your bitch in the summer time, and guess what she under mines
Under minded, you have to underline it
Illiterate triple six is what the fucking time is (Golf Wang)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I flow so hard you can't tell if my dick is gonna bust
I'm sick I need that Robituss' and that lobster stroganoff
I'm faded, chauffeured up, smoking up, rolling up another Dutch
Amsterdam where the women are Dutch, freaks that don't talk much
Redheads gimme that bedhead, I told Becky to give me that redneck
And I'm rocking my "NIGGA" hat, like ya nigga bad
And my nigga's strapped, gun shot wit' it
Gun shot wit' it, gun shot wit' it
I'mma be a fucking legend like 2Pac and Biggie
Sending smoke signals to the heavens, tell the lord to come and get me
Or a higher power to arrive in a hour
I gotta smoke this ounce up, put my shades on let's bounce y'all

[Hook]
