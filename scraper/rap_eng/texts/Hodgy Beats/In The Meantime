Fuck with me
We need all in, heed, artists
Be cautious, sleep lost and we
Breathe it for life, we see-sawing
In my dreams I can still hear the streets calling
Trying to think while I'm hitting this weed, free falling
Please excuse all my antics, I'm paranoid and I panic
But manage to be the illest shit on this planet
I lived it just how I planned it, though depression was manic
If you understand it crept in no permission was granted
Young Doms who you get when you mention the ambition
You kids in a man's vision I stay out the man's buisiness
Don't care for your band members and none of your bland lyrics
Fuck your fans spirit, too damn high and we can't hear it
I'm fearless, shit I been on this earth for a while
And ain't no church in the wild, ain't been to church in a while
Fuck these rap niggas they just wanna purchase your style
You live a fake nigga life so it should hurt when you smile
Fuck all the fame and the shine it brings hate to the mind
And I only do so I'm considered great when I die
And even though niggas tend to envy blatant I rise
Patience is fine, tell the world I'm taking my time

Mellowhigh
Just smoke, man

[Hodgy Beats]

I life for whatever inspires me or expires me
Entirely as a whole I require some prior things
Ambition is a blessing, patience is a virtue
Put both of them in a bowl begin to stir, it'll come full circle
No trust for none of you women
You want love I'mma probably hurt you
No love for none of you niggas
Front on me and my words will murk you
Im hurtful, weapons a curse I disperse you my world is black and white
Fuck the color purple my niggas banging that smurf blue
Put you in the dirt's roots, I'm in that cumulonimbus call it the earth's roof
How'd I come up with this I'm fucking sick recording this
While she suck my snuffalupagus, I'm on my bitch
When nigga find another bitch, ain't that a bitch, no its just a bitch
Im in this bitch to win this bitch, now fuck a bitch, I'm oven lit
Yeah hummus dip, put my peter on your señoritas
Who you fucking with, my margaritas in for heaters
Food for thought: eat another sip. Yep

As I smoke my spliff
OF… till the death of me nigga
And we present to you:
Mellowhigh
