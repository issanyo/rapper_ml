[Verse 1]
This ain't appropriate now
Push my hand off your side
There’s no one else around
I just wanna tease your eyes
Maybe we can check these locks
I just wanna go inside
Why's it so dead on a Friday night?
I guess the morning’s here if you wake by five

[Hook]
You send my life
Into somewhere I can’t describe
So many details
What had happened to the time we had?
I thought you said you won't ever
(I know I promised to wait)
Won't ever leave me
What happened to us?
(I really did try)

[Verse 2]
OK, I’ll take you back
Alright, let’s pick up where we started
Don’t think that’s in my head
I’m not a bit cold hearted
Save yourself tonight
Tomorrow I'll get you back
I don't think I have your problem
I don't think I have your problem
I don't think I have a problem
I don't think I mean to fuss
I don't want to bother you
And there is no reason to rush

[Hook]
You send my life
Into somewhere I can’t describe
So many details
What had happened to a time we had
I thought you said you won't ever
Won't ever leave me
What happened to us

[Verse 3: Hodgy Beats]
I'm wearing flip-flops to the beach to put my feet in sand
And I'm bringing sin [?]
Fly, never die, Peter Pan [?]
I can, I can be your man
If you can, cooking pans, no crooked lands [?]
Or you can move it on in with friends
They say relationships make you sick
So why should I even take the risk
Of dating a bitch if she ain't legit
I'm looking for support
Cutting myself short, when the ball's in the court
Sounds begin to distort
Can't hear me when I clarify, until I disappear in skies
Tell me you miss a nigga while he's on tour
Girl I think you are just bored
Go out and go get yours
You're jealous of my success
Confess it, it's coming out your pores
Once you open up and express feelings, now you're closing doors
Mainly when they automatic
What happened to passion?
Hugs and compassion, me rubbing your ass and us laughin
Using no Magnums, love's an assassin
Screwed the caption
I should've wrapped it up before I finished rapping

[Hook: Toro Y Moi]
You send my life, into somewhere
I can’t describe, so many details
[x3]
