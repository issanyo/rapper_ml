[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Ay
I'm cocking the Smith'an', no nonsense forgiven
All these tracks that I'm whipping, man I'm locked in the kitchen
Nose is snotty, they sniffling
Niggas stop with the bitching
I'm too Scotty, I'm pimping
Now you stopping and listen
Man I got this, I'm itching
Fourth quarter, fought them some inches
Do it for my son first, second is the riches
Find a bad bitch that don't act like bad bitches
I smash it once then pass the blunt, now I got mad bitches
Money is the motto you can run my tab, bitches
I'm just testing your judgment like were up in a lab with it
And you fucking failed and up for sale, you're the type to pop off at your fucking mouth, and duck your tail
I'm trying to get money long, grab a old stack, this bundle stale
Coasting a sail on all these paperless trails
You can get your issue nigga, better post a mail
Either love me or go to hell, I keep depression concealed on me
What goes around comes around, a fortune of wheels homie
I'ma buy my momma a whip, Porsche with the heels, homie
I put that on my momma and I put that on my sponsor
You can't put down a beach monster, bow down when you meet your honor
Yeah

[Break]

[Verse 2]
I got this watch my handles then bitch I'm channeled in
Your man's just rambling, talking sweet like a mandarin
I'm gaining wait and fit to win
Roll up the twin and hit the twin
Righteous, but yo we live this and rep it in brims
One of the best doing it this millennium, my blood thick is as skin
No haters in my peripherals, tunnel vision got me squinting
I direct my future like I'm Quintin
I'm stacking M and M's, put them Benjamens
