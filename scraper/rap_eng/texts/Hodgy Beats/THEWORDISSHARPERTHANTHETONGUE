[Intro]
Some people man, they just, they just suck
Fucking being people

[Verse 1]
Sacrifice teach us on how to be patient
All they look for is your opinion and some validation
Just left my moms for breakfast, smelling like family and bacon
My heart beats irrationally, passionately racing
Sipping on a 40 by my waste, 38 special
It's a day and niggas late on the pearly gates schedule
I'm complicated, thoughts concentrated and intellectual
Architects were building inseperable like green and a vegetable
I was wild, they thought I repped demon inside a pentical
Asking what he believe in, he tells him "these genitals"
Grabbing his tentacles [?] dollar fifty [?]
Or responsible but accessible to the [?] backs bendable

[Interlude]
And on the second note, on the second note
Yeah

[Verse 2]
On the second note, you're killing my high
The vibe went from hater get away, fuck I hope that you die
Not in a [?] not alive, I mean inside
[?] this eagle when it cries, no further words implied
Smoke the hottest earth till I'm blue like Poppa Smurf
When you see me, pop a perc
I deal with pain, a lot of hurt
Sleep it off for a hour something, and right to work
Structure it recite a verse
Reignite a birth of who you are
Who are you? where you are, where you are?
I be that sparkle at night included with every star
Expect me to pull up in hoopty or luxury car
Go from having nothing but yourself to having it all
No help, mad at yourself backing into the wall
In order to rise and become a fireball, you gotta fall
You gotta fall, pick up the line if she call

[Verse 3]
I leave a third note
Got you speeds of a turtle
Now you're reaching in cubbard drinking cups of
They say drugs get the best of you
Take over your soul and the rest of you
What's left of you
A little money in the bank with nothing best to do
But watch it drive away and go red and blue
It seems like you let your head to get to you
Like it was ahead of you, slowed you down, and beheaded you
[?] your revenue, your health, your medical
Eternal ghosts roam earth the remains of 'em is residue
My itchy, sweaty palms
Check for your crew, they check for you and all you execute
I'm letting go, free falling without a parachute
