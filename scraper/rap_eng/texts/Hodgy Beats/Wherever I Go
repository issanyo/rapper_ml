[Intro]

So in reality we've got time
Ya dig?

[Verse 1: Pockets]

Who's the hunter when
Its your niggas down-in streets like the number 10?
I need a Big Benz cos theres snakes in the ends
And I'm clocking them
In or out of town my London Eye watching them
Bitches onto the kid like they want me to nut in them
I'll see where it Leads cos I'm in Wolves with a bunch of them
They say what I'm writings enlightening
Stunning them
These are just thoughts from my thunder pen
I'm known to pot the black -
Pool games with the flat -
Out in Leicester
An 8th in my tracks
And blade if i take my creps off
Before you were Luton I was already messed up
My livers pool
Like a liver full of hennessey you would of ridiculed
We Ignore whichever hater try to address us
Like what you on my friend?
You'll get rocked in a way you can't comprehend
Like Stonehenge and die in vein like a syringe
And this weed like the yang to my ying
Your girl smoke
I might assist her like my next of kin
I'm here to leave my prints as a king
From a prince to a king
But I'm more like the grinch
And nothing like Prince
You niggas need to let me live...

Coz wherever I go its the same old
They say its life and suppose its the way it goes...
