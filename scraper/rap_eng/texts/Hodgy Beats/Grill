[Intro: Hodgy Beats]
Keep Smokin'
Keep Smokin'

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Bring something new to the table
And I don't want yams because I had some yesterday
But I can smoke grams blaze one almost everyday
And I don't shake hands and make plans with a featherweight
Wolf Gang Clan sold out when we set a date
Klux Klan burn the stage down let it marinate
Correlate, Circulate, Percolate
A work of fate, it hurts to hate
For me there's no surrogate
Bring the fucking food to the table
And if you get cheese make it provolone or parmesan
Rolling Mary Jane, killers — pain in my other arm
Holding on a dame and her main in my other arm
Such a charm, so it’s on, smoke til it’s gone
Feel withdrawn, These bitches blown
They better call Tyron, about where upon
She’s at and um, sit on a bus stop like she do salons
Or bag a bitch for me like she fucking works at Vons
Uh

[Hook x2]
It's the M, the E, the L
The L, the O, W, H
The Y, the P, the P, the E

It's the M, the E, the L
The L, the O, W, H
The Y, the P, get your money

[Verse 2: Left Brain]
Never been a buster nigga
I ride with them thuggish niggas
Mellowhigh, Loiter Squad
I ride with them ruggish niggas
Never fuck a bitch up in the bucket, she just suck a nigga
81 box chevy
Dirty seats, dirty sprite
Ridin' dirty through the night
Shining like some pearly whites
Lurking for the popo though
Fuck them punks
Exit out the way I'mma hit the Shake Junt
Hey, my nigga G gon' smoke 8 joints
Kill the bottle, full throttle
Bad bitch still fuck with me
I still fuck with y'all
But we ain’t fuck for free
All my wolves we eat feet said we all floss
We boss hogs ain’t all talk
Sawed off y'all small talk
Big noise, big toys
Monster truck, dumpster truck
Fuck the slut in dump and smut
Trash wang, that's what's up (x5)

[Hook x4]
