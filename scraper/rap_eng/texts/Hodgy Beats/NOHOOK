[Intro]
H

[Verse 1]
I'm cocking and smithing, no nonsense forgiven
All these tracks that I'm whipping
Man I'm locked in the kitchen
Nose is snotty, they sniffling
Niggas stop with the bitching
I'm too Scottie, I'm Pippen
Now you stopping to listen
Man I got some itching for a quarter [?] inches
Do it for my son first, second is the riches
Find a bad bitch that don't act like bad bitches
I smash it once then pass the blunt, now I got mad bitches
Money is the motto, you could run my tab bitches
I'm just testing your judgement like we're up in the lab with it
And [?] cell
You the type to pop off at your fucking [?] tell
I'm trying to get money long, grab an O
Stack this bundle still
[?] trail
You can get your issue nigga better post mail
Either love me or go to hell, I keep the pressure conceiled homie
What goes around, comes around fortune and wills homie
I'ma buy my momma a whip, Porsche with them heels, homie
I put that on my momma and I put that on my sponsor
You can't put down a beast monster
Bow down when you meet your honor

[Verse 2]
I got this, watch my handles then
Bitch I'm channeled in
Your man just rambling, talking sweet like a Mandarin
I gained the weight and fit to win
Roll up the twin and hit the twin
Rictious but yo, we live this in red fitted brims
One of the best doing it in this milenium
My blood is thick as skin
No haters in my peripheral, tunnel vision got my squintin
I direct my future like I'm Quentin
Stacking M&M's, put them Benjamins over bitches like [?]
Innocent or not, I'm still a nigga
I toned it down a few notches, ain't tryna blow the system
You out here trying to get you some money, playing the victim
Playing like you rich when you hungry out on a mission
I just play by the code, I hitch em and ditch em
Man I'm just playing my role, I stick to the scripting
Hodgy do what he want without permission, permission
The magician musician, tricking
