[Intro]
I need my support system
I need not to abort wisdom
I need this distorted rhythm

[Verse 1]
What is my destiny lord?
They say, prayer is the recipe lord
I be ready to send these niggas to visit you and they be pressing me lord
I got one goon he do it expertise lord
I keep my son close at all times like he right next to me lord
I gave up on you a while ago, and you still blessing me lord
You never questioned me lord
I feel your energy lord
You showed me how to forgive my family and enemies lord
(I hear the devil talking to me, he depend on me lord)
To spread evil, that's not the remedy lord
And it will never be lord
Pride I push aside and recognise the sensory, lord
I'm a slave to my own thoughts, no penitentiary lord
We all gon' die and lie in the cemetery eventually lord
You know my tendencies won't be the same when I'm 70 lord
I wanna spread positivity like it's leprosy lord
And I thank you for the gift you've given me, that lives in me lord
That's real

[Hook]
I'm thankful for my life
I'm grateful
We all gon' die someday

[Verse 2]
That's how I've been feeling, I'll go when I'm willing
I'm running through the building to get to the ceiling
The devil coming and he killing my focal civilians
Praying for better days, put my hope in god willing
You led me to places, thank you for taking me
I know I come off misunderstood, you haven't mistaken me
I'm already above, whether calm, collected or the crazy me
I don't wanna be a slave lord, the world is bathing in slavery
I empty out my mental to this vacancy
My occupation's make sure my seed is taken care of and he's not hating me
I was delayed for a second but never latent see
Pull up on them blatantly
(It's not, it's all part, it's all part of the process)
I know shit is getting to me
You say you hearing me out
But I don't believe that you hearing me fully
Belief, nigga sneak indiscreet
Between the sheets of life is where the beast sleep
At the table of death is most likely where the beast eats
Over-dosage on the beat 'til the beat no longer beats
Peskitarian fishing at an aquarium
Fishscale that Webster-Merriam
Deceasing bacterium on my back, that's where I carry 'em
I'm letting go

(I remember when i was your age, I wish I would've known what I know now, but this is just the that way life goes, it's meant for us to learn)

Letting go of your promises
Promises lead to consequence, when you commit to something and do the opposite
Sick to your stomach, you're vomiting, a Ramadan
No food for children you're fathering
The possibility of your family surviving this shit is kinda slim
First place, the gold trophy, bitch I gotta win
Seems like that's what my only option is

And for that

[Hook]
I'm thankful for my life
I'm grateful
We all gon' die someday

[Outro]
That's how I've been feeling, I'll go when I'm willing
I'm running through the building to get to the ceiling
The devil coming and he killing my focal civilians
Praying for better days, put my hope in god willing
