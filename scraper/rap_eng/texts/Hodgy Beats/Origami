[Intro]
She want a house in the hills
And some kids that I can't take to Disney
Well tell them kids that I'm busy
Busy putting Swiss armies through the Swiss cheese

[Verse]
Complex and simple man, I'm simplest
Rolling marijuana in cigarettes, no cigarette
Momma told me don't smoke them cigarettes
She said I'm too smart, too smart, I got intellect
I pray to God we don't cross paths and we don't intersect
You're just a bass in the water, I got my fishing net
Call me addicted, conflicted, just don't get too specific
I run the road of Roadrunner, run it like Chris when I'm sprinting
I'm a hard head and a rolling stone, I never listen
Man I'm bout to set the world on fire like a brush fire
That be watching while I'm chiseling
I'm camping I'm chilling (I be chilling my nigga)
Marshmellows and Twizzlers (Twizzlers my nigga)
I hunt for the game, I skin it then grill bitch, this is not [?]
Got a album that bout to come out of the closet my nigga, no feelings
Love women, hate bitches
Not a mysoganist I will massage her then hit her, where
Run it back, this track's so good
She gon' run it back, run this lap so good

[Hook]
I wanted to get married, married to you
I thought you was somebody, you proved that you're nobody
I'm married to myself, solo solo solo-domi
I'ma get the dough and fold it, origami

[Verse 2]
They say Hodgy is mystical, I'm predictable
He too difficult, he'll get physical
Behind the visual
On a different note, call him delisional
Locked behind his own bars, he's a criminal
Kids flow, baby bars, embryo
Karma like the ferris wheel and the merry go
It's goin' round, it's goin' down like a burial
A milk carton kill a nigga for your cereal
I'm a student, I came with my lecture material
Never chase a hoe, chase a hoe Cheerios
Pass furious nigga, fast furious
Abolishing, comglomorous, demolish it
Your confidence, fuck what a comment is
I'm a star, I'm astonishing
I'm a drug like klonopin
I'm the lump in your throat when you swallow it
So far ahead of human, I jog to win
If they break my legs I'll still be opulent
I'm a mystery, you're too obvious
Of course he's a sorcerer, prosperous
And I bet when I leave they gon' follow us
Me, me, and me nigga, all of us

[Hook]
I wanted to get married, married to you
I thought you was somebody, you proved that you're nobody
I'm married to myself, solo solo solo-domi
I'ma get the dough and fold it, origami
