[Intro]
No pain, no pain

[Hook]
They want me to feel no pain
They say I shouldn't feel no pain
They say I shouldn't feel no feelings
I've kept it G, OG since the very beginning
And they say I shouldn't feel it, no pain
That's what you want, you want me to feel no pain
What do I want, I want shit to change yeah
Nigga what do I want, I know that I'ma remain the same
I know that I'ma remain the same

[Verse 1]
I got a knife, I just want my slice
I pray to God, pray to Holy Christ
I pay attention, pay my dues, and pay the price
Pray he forgive me for my sins, I say it twice
I live a double life for my son man I'm going harder
They hate to see a nigga do weller than wells [?]
You can't see me, I disappear [?]
Fighting my way through my journey like I'm a Spartan
They say I'm crazy, well maybe I'm just retarded
I may be crazy but label me cold hearted
[?] tryna find where Noah's Ark is
Blemish to blemish I'ma finish what I started
First get my back off the wall [?] target
Regardless I'm getting to it, I'm off the [?]
I'm internally flawless, nigga never [?]
Word to the most highest, my business, and my goddess

[Verse 2]
I'm never going give up, even on Thanksgiving
Listening to [?]
She gonna open her mailbox and get the picture
They say that life [?] picture
Sippin' on the booth straight out the pitcher
On my collage, you cannot cut me out the picture
Spit on the microphone and everyone that's listening
You going out of business, blow out sale
I'm blowing out my pistons, show and tell
He showing you the witness
I hope you well, the plague and sickness
Is turning these humans into zombies
They prolly dropping with the quickness
Pointing fingers [?]
Rock and roll like Metallic
Chilling with some villains, nigga chillin [?] your spirit
