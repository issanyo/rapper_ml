[Intro]
I Love the keys no Alicia
Marz Productions

[Verse 1]
This is feel good, Excellent to is real good music
All I need is honey I can groove with
All she need is a nigga she can move with
Whisper words in her ear like a Q-Tip
She comprehend when I speak no confusing
I Make her days bright as yellow whens she blue's
I jump in the obstacles of love when you in
I tell you every secret and you grin
And if you put up a fight i'll let you win
Because mami' im gentleman, I can be sentimental when I touch your gentle hands
I won't floss your love im not a rental-man
Skip Six Flags and go straight to Never-land
What's funny is I never felt this
It's automatic like I never help this

[Hook]
You got me Sky High
You got me Sky, You got me High
You got me Sky High
X2

[Verse 2]
Wherever you wanna go, we can go there
Whatever's mine is yours girl, we gone share
If you having a worst day im gone care
Cause you're like a diamond in the sand you're rare
In the streets of L.A., Where true crimes
Two times, and never have to do time
I glow and imma' let you shine
And if they ask how you doing, say fine, cause you fine
Let them ask them how you doing, Say you mine
With my ten cents, never get a new dime
I swear I haven't been realer
Though im less of a lover and more of a killer
I Almost do anything to please you
I Need you, Never not Keisha
(Say Goodbye to April and Shaneequa)
You're Beautiful, Bonita
Im just telling you how I feel inside
Cause I like to hide and make you Seek
Open up your eyes if you 1,2,3
Your Love is like candy cause it's to sweet

[Hook]
