[Intro]
You should let life, life
Have it's wayward
You should let the world
Have nothing, aye

[Chorus 1]
You want to have a heart to heart, nigga?
They told me to play it smart, nigga
I'mma tear it up and rip shit apart, nigga
Hey, I'mma play my part nigga
I'mma go bar for bar, bar for bar, bar for bar, nigga, yeah
You want to have a heart to heart, nigga?
I'mma tear your shit apart, nigga
Bar for bar, nigga

[Verse 1]
It's rare that you would catch me off guard, blindsided
I'm just like Mike, Mike Will, Miley Cyrus
Close my eyelids, feel my iris dilate
Ain't bothered by hate, I'm steppin' to it
We face the fate nigga
Hodgy bout to build a conglomerate nigga
Make sure my business ain't made with no concentrate
All the equities and the artists I conjugate, with myself
Most people come and intoxicate your circle
Suck the life out of your circle, then confiscate your circle
See what they did, man they made you hate your circle
Ya'll some wild niggas, and to them the colour purple
Tappin' in your church shoes to the harmonies
SMH to the slandering Simon these
Shittin' on your knees and swallow all of these OMGs
Where does the road that's golden lead
I hold myself and read I'm a mythology
H, Wizard

[Chorus 2]
If you ain't speaking from your heart, nigga
You can't go bar to bar with a
Real nigga going hard, nigga
What I'm talking I'm living it bar for bar, nigga
Bar for bar, bar for bar, bar for bar, nigga
I'm the king of Agrabah, you Jafar, nigga
French rolls don't play, I roll just my part, nigga
Ready to spark, g-g-going bar for bar, nigga

[Verse 2]
You get your first couple installments
We bout to see how fucking hungry you are (you are)
About how much about this money you are (you are)
This road is so fraudulent when becoming a star
I ride for my niggas
When it's beefing that don't mean running to the car
Unlocking my door, hearing engine roar, pedal to the floor
I thought he had they back man, what he left them for?
They say heaven's on the same level as the devil's door
I keep pressing number 7 on the elevator
Fuck them niggas and they set, that's what you tell a hater
It's cliche to say we going up like escalators
Niggas want a copy us and fucking automate us
I'll just write a solo while they fucking huddle up
If niggas talking just because man I'mma shut em up
It's all a game in their head, I'll let em run amok
Remember the game is over once the buzzer bust
