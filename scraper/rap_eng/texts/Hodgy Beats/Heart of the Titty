(Intro)
HB
Hodgy Beats
Just incase you didn't know

(Verse 1)
I been around the world
Like misplaced groceries
I'mma go back
Those memories are Kodak
Take a snap for the throwback
My snapback is my hat
Shaq is on the throw back
My city behind me
The Hype is climbin'
Up the fuckin brokeback
Jack twistin' off the cap
Alma rollin' swishers
Blunt out weed light candles
Wait first make a couple of wishes
In 2005
I was puttin' up 5 to get high
Now we get on mile-high-club
Mileage up just to get fly
How does it feel to be the best?
I'm realer I'm waitin' to be next
N'd rather push my way through
So money come when pay is due
MellowHype jersey feelin' worthy
Who good at paid dues
Odd Future reignin' terror
Better wear your rain boots
Man it's great when you the shit
When you're the toilet things get drainin'
We're runnin' for the chair
You run your job
You campaignin'
Swearin' under oaths
Protected by the umbrella
Like it's rainin'
Got America on her toes so much
Her toenails breakin'

Uhh

(Hook)
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of time

(Verse 2)
I wanna be the perfect pops to my son
And he'll look at me like
"Daddy you're the greatest
I wanna be just like you"
I tell him
"Be like me
But with a higher IQ"
So he can cut through
All the fat fluids
And water dilute
I butt my head a couple times
Puttin' my hammer to the screw
But I fix my situation
Word of mouth
Down to the truth
Swallow and assimilate
A nigga's fate
Jealousy begins to generate
The bitter hate
It's leprosy the way it spreads
All through the nigga face
Actin like
His girlfriend slept with me
Now he got some shit to say
He'll receive the tallest death from me
Respectfully
Disrespectin' me
Results in weaponry
Check ya speed
And all the extra steez
Before you're left to bleed
All I got is appliances nigga
Do you know what pressure needs?
I'm a fabulous antagonist
Blasphemous rapper talented
The bowel movement
Flatulencin'
Urinary calluses

Ye
Hodgy Beats nigga
That's just an update
Ha Ha Ha Ha
