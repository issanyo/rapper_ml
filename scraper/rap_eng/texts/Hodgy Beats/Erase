[Hodgy Beats: Hook]
Every time I hear your name
Every time I see your face
I no longer wanna feel this pain
I wish it would all erase
Erase, erase, I wish it would all erase
I no longer wanna feel this pain
I wish it would all erase

[Verse 1]
Erase us as if, it was written with a pencil
Erase the memories which are present in my mental
Erase your inbox, the flowers that I sent you
Erase the agreements, our agreements are resentful
Say goodbye I'll see you next life time
Cause you and I freeze now on my life line
Say goodbye since we can't come to get along
Or I'll say goodbye, so long
The Longest Yard is how we prolong
And now I feel like Mama Kush singing so gone
I never meant to bring you any trouble
Dug myself in the hole and laid in it with my shovel
The truth come to surface when you brush off the rubble
So I bite my tongue like I'm strapped with a muzzle
I struggle with my routes like a wide receiver in a huddle
Allergic to the world, world boy in the bubble

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Love beat me up, I wonder if you're sore yet
Fire missiles and bombs at each other like we warheads
Jay said life is but a beach chair
When a female can leave you like Steven McNair
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
She gotta hundred problems with her pistol gun
Stimulate a drop top convertibles, I'm roofless
I feel like Eminem I just might lose it
I'm in the chamber like a bullet of a ratchet
Got my licensed camera but I never watch my actions
Split the pie, divide us up in fractions
Caught you snooping, your heels ain't got traction
No Patron and Grey Goose when I'm love drunk
No Patron and Grey Goose but I was drunk
No return policy, no return sale
The details of a difficult female

[Hook]

Erase out my memories, erase out my memories, burning pictures...
Erase out my memories, go ahead... erase out my memories
I wish it'd all erase, I wish it'd all erase
I wish it'd all erase, like it never ever took place
