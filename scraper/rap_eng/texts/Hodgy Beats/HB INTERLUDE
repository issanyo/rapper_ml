[Intro]
(Swiff D)
Feel it, uh

[Verse 1]
The drugs talk to me
Got my mind autistic and artistic
I don't reason with word of mouth
Only the logistics can be horrific
Around niggas and bitches that don't know you
Try to showboat you without a motor boat to move through currents
Currently currency got me and homies with tourrettes
Aimlessly wordless cursing
Finding the meaning of hurt worth it
If you make it through the storm
Dark clouds and scattered lightening
It's enlightening even though it's frightening
I step to the microphone like it's Tyson's ring
In order to be the king, gotta fight the king, defeat the king
I'm fucking Scar in Lion King, I'm bleeden-ing
If I don't get help now, I'll be gone by the evening
Ain't no really help, but to deal with yourself
If you can't deal with yourself, man you're killing yourself
Man you're killing yourself, can't keep it real with yourself
I'm revealing bad health, pull them steels out your belt

[Hook]
I feel the pressure by the minute
I'm above the world, behind its limits
Moving through lectures and fucking gimmicks
Studying the world and its limits
My child's growing watching me, he gon' mimic
I'm not here repeating cycles, homie make a difference
The world listening, the world and its limits

[Verse 2]
I'm telling ghost stories, Hodgy ghostwrote for me
Acknowledge my blessings, rather you up your hopes for me
Leave notes for me to read from a poet on open seas
Nourishing growth like broken seeds
Cut a record, hope it bleeds
From the throat and groping it breathe
Find me in the cut, smoking and rolling most of the weed
Focused on growing up while I'm up holdin' culture
My seeds, done smoking from me
They say hi when they see me and they don't want me to leave
Well I'm an introvert and if it isn't work then it didn't work
I'm not showing up to your party
Pardon me for my gesture, no I'm not saying sorry
Darling, I'm not with the lectures, I rather play Atari
My demons, they follow me like a shadow and
These bitches all on me because they shallow
A nigga from dirty Jersey, I'm coming straight from the ghettos
Crank the volumes til you heard me loud and clearly
The system rattle

[Hook]
I feel the pressure by the minute
I'm above the world, behind its limits
Moving through lectures and fucking gimmicks
Studying the world and its limits
My child's growing watching me, he gon' mimic
I'm not here repeating cycles, homie make a difference
The world listening, the world and its limits
