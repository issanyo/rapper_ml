[Intro]
Just another day in the life (Hodgy Beats)
Gotta lot-ta gotta lot-ta weed to smoke
Gotta lot-ta gotta lot-ta weed to smoke
Gotta lot-ta gotta lot-ta weed to smoke

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
It's crazy when you have a vision isn't it?
Chef Boyar nigga
Back up in the kitchen with it
Like what a witted fitted
Oh why you actin' timid
These are with lots of lemon or a regal box of tinted
I hold the grahams I'm not talkin' bout the cracker
Ask my grams when you smoke one it'll relax ya
Mary Jane a muscle relaxer
Had enough of these bastards
Blow a half worth like man my calf hurt
You smokin' bad dirt
Where all that stress come from?
Son you look mad worse
Weed will get it off your shoulders
Pin and pad works
Wearin' a fucked up move
Like a plaid skirt
I got this kid up is gave cash a cash shirt
Before I left asked her about the organic OG mask dirt
She was so high my question slipped right passed her
The moral of my story is these good greens
I smoke myself to sleep and have a good dream (dream, dream)

[Hook: Hodgy Beats]
Gotta lot-ta gotta lot-ta weed to smoke
Gotta lot-ta gotta lot-ta
Yeah, oh oh oh
Gotta lot-ta, weed to smoke (to smoke, smoke, smoke, Wolf Gang, smoke)
Smoke, ha ha
Smoke

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I got them grams
I got that hash
I got the keef
It's all up in my bowl
I'm ready to roll (weed) up
And then we gonna' smoke
Nigga we chillin'
Nigga we chillin'
We ain't trippin' on ya'll bitch ass niggas
Fuck ya'll niggas
Suck my dick up
Wolf Gang bitch
Where the fuck my weed at?

I don't really fuck with many producers and shit
