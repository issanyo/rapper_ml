[Intro]
You know I rather a motherfucker shoot me in my face than shoot me in my back so I can look my murderer in the eye before he take my life. You know what I'm saying. Die so I can be born again. Kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me. Yeah

[Verse 1]
Niggas crying over a clout like boo-hoo
I'm shedding tears over instrumentals from U2
You wanna diss me on a record and shake my hand in public
When you see me now that I don't fuck with you too
I put 'em to bed, they slept on me, they snooze lose
They see me acting crazy but they never see a dude bruised
My screw's loose, bitch I'm a motherfucking coo-coo
I brush shit off like coo-coo
Play it cool man you're too cool
I see these grown men whispering telling secrets
You say it to my face, I break your face, better believe it nigga
Throw a bone and wish it don't come back
But wait til the dog fetches it and fuckin' receives it nigga
All that shit you from your ego is shot down like a free throw
Talking like a bunch of tricks, mistreating niggas
Once I turn my back, no point of return, I'm leaving nigga
I be the odd ball, just call it even nigga

[Hook]
Say I wasn't loyal (Say that I wasn't)
Say I wasn't loyal nigga (Say that I wasn't)
Just say I wasn't loyal
Wait til that shit recoils
Say I wasn't loyal, say I wasn't loyal
I'm a hot head, I boil, I boil
I bless them with my prescense, they spoil

[Verse 2]
It's my world, I walk around on my earth
And when I die, I'ma dig my fucking Joe Dirt
Niggas talking sweet,  I squeeze your life out like Gogurt
A black man, black arm, black fist, no shirt
Lucid dreams talk big afterwards
And then I do what I'm talking about, a proverb
I had them drugs in my hand, popping xans, moving slower
You lie in the grass, I'm starting to mower
Running your mouth, you can't stop the fuckin' motor nigga
I'm the same I'm golden, whether high as fuck or sober
I'm hopping off the bandwagon niggas tryna get over
Watch me pull a cat out the hat speaking matter facts like your wardrobe
Chasing golden pots and leprechauns, rainbows picking the four leaf clovers
Shit ain't the same since this fame came
Don't gotta say names, I just play the blame game, nigga

[Hook]
