[Hook]
I say it's really cold, really cold in this world man
And nobody cares
Can't save the children, boys, little girls in this world
Cause it's filled by Wolverines and Bears
I wouldn't wanna be isolated, with no one to share

[Verse 1]
I'm heated, and it's cold outside, freezing
I'm in the 609 chiefing, with one of my peeps takin' vacation
Leavin' jail time and bail money
Or ironic to each, plus the court fees and a good lawyer
Knowing a nigga guilty
Man he was riding filthy
Heard his homie was snitching on em, stealing money on the side
Wired by cops, they stitched it on 'em
The lines he pitched were sure to pick apart the picnic homie
Now I won't see him, i'm feeling distanced
He's sitting in prison homie
I work a different type of work, he work until the pistol bursts
Do dirt but first check for the clerk
Move work put that dead weight in the hearse
Cool nurse, i'm bruising, hurt
And I'm sick to my stomach
Dealing with sticky situations
Consequences coming from me


[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo here I go I do me
Twenty four seven, three sixty five, seven days of the week
They see me shining at they beef
Man that mentality's weak
Man you ain't getting off you feet
When your shots fall too cheap
Probably consumer, childish loser
Make your bed in your sleep
Idle time will kill a niggas mind
I'm responsible for responding, clearly a waste of time
I practice positivity since Trenton arrived pre-history
Not to blame him but he changed me realistically
It's my job to roll clean your jobs to watch me to misery
Bringing a cold storm like a wizard in blizzardry
I'm an adult, you're a kid to me, stuffin' blunts into nicotine
Kickin' back watching my niggas TV show on the TV screen

[Hook]
