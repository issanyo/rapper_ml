Hey, been around, been around
Never left nigga
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Haha yeah, uh

[Hook]
Can't tell me what my future looks like
You can know, you can
Can you tell me what my mirror looks like
You can, I bet you can
Tell me
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Wanna meet up with me and talk about your feelings
Talk about your feelings with me as long as you feel 'em
Feeling everything that you feel before there's no feeling

I got problems and house of cards I shuffle  and I deal 'em
Deal with all of my problems, one by one out of a million
You say you wanna play the villain, huh you wanna play the...
Reading from the script, playing the role [?] chamellion
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm seeing it clearer right in the mirror
Standing before my 'flection
Angels they watch over me, my only protection

[Hook]
