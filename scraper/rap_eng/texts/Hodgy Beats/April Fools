[Intro]
H, B, yeah!

[Verse 1]
Our letters divide as we differ, differ like a high over liquor
Shot glass or bong, which one hit me quicker?
You made me turn before, you should hit the flicker
Unless you want a bumper car fender bender
I know I'm guilty but I'm not from the surrender gender
I was introduced to the world in November - send a
Rose in the mail love written on the petals
Picked out the concrete, in the middle of the ghetto
She make me rage (rage) like I'm listenin' to techno
Had no insurance cause I paid for the gecko
My past made my future, the reason no regretful
But not for her, she the one that made me special
I'm from the bottom, shorty from the middle middle class
Was a pot of gold, had me on the Skittle task
If she want something, she don't forget to ask
Because I put her first, all the other bitches last (yeah)

[Hook]
Girls on my left (left) girls on my right (right)
But there's only one that's spendin' the night
And it's you (it's you) it's you (it's you)
It's you (it's you) it's you (it's you)
Girls on my left (left) girls on my right (right)
But there's only one that's spendin' the night
And it's you (it's you) it's you (it's you)
It's you - GIRL, it's you

[Verse 2]
I can say that I met you on accident, it's the truth B
Caught a stutter in my tone when she introduced me
Your shirt tight, purse white, Gucci
I'm her type, shirt white, sag pants loosely
She got my duck (duck) duck goose see
Out in the pu-blic, girl I'm actin goofy
Popcorn and chips, go with the movie
Kiss you while we in the store, I don't care who sees
Three A's, two B's, two C's
C's stand for credit, and I get extra
She give me more of what the haters get less of
I hop off the tour bus and never a next-up
She stay in the (Lab) with me like (Dexter)
Drive me around, cause she sweet like nectar
I'm complimentin' you, girl it's not a lecture
I'm happy you let the Boogeyman get'cha

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
Don't rush it, it's early, there's crust in your eyes
But surely, I notice, the lust in your eyes
Girlie, I know you had enough of the guys
Start with HB, don't be trustin the lies

[Verse 3]
Do you wanna spend the night? (The night?)
Do you wanna spend the night? (Huh?) And fall in love
Do you wanna spend the night? (The night?)
Do you wanna spend the night? (Night?) And fall in love
Do you wanna spend the night?
Maybe you can even be my wife - just for tonight
Do you wanna spend the night?
Girl you can spend the night, tonight

[Hook]
