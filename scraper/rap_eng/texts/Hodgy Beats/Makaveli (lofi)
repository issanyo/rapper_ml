[Prelude: Unknown]
Jerome! Jerome! Put on that Bobby Womack!
Naw, girl, I wanna go way back. Aww yeah, check this out!

[Verse 0: Hodgy Beats]
And tonight I'mma pay homage
To one of the big homies up in the heavens
Makaveli, haha, this one for you, nigga
Everybody that been in love with a shorty before
Grab your shorty that you've been in love with, even if you don't love her no more

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I remember the days when I was falling for you
Your brother ain't pick up the phone, knew I was calling for you
I was a little badass, skipping off school
Taking class at the courthouse, and almost home schooled
I made my own rules, knew I was bad as fuck
In the morning I'm chasing ass after bowls of Captain Crunch
I'm a little nigga, but I'm a live wire
They say a hot head is known to set shit on fire
Girl, I remember the days I used to sneak inside your house
Crazy over the pussy, yo momma catch us, kick me out
Hating on the situation, but I know she love me
I love what's premature, what like a set of bubblies
Teach yo baby how to roll a swisher
So every time she smoke one she'll think of a nigga
Yo first initial thought about me in forever while
Girl I'm forever wild, but I could always make you smile
Like back in the day

[Hook: Hodgy Beats]
Back in the day, like back in the day
Back in the day, like back in the day
Back in the day, do you remember those days?
Back in the day, back- back in the day
When I was lost for words I'd get 'em back in a day
When yo feelings ran away you got 'em back in a day
I'm actin' like I don't know you, 'cause you be actin so strange
Walkin' down memory lane
Thinkin' back in the, ba- back in the day

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Girl, all we have is our memories
And you should always love a nigga, I'm not your enemy
When I got my first cell phone I used to text you late
When you needed another lung I helped you respirate
Learning life lessons together when problems escalate
I premeditate, then put you first, I'm the predicate
You caught me up with other bitches, just another victim
I'm a dog, nigga, stuck in this corrupted system
Smoking weed and cigarettes
Drinking Hennessy and going off pints of liquor
Girl, when I'm gone I'm coming back 'cause girl I missed ya
Through the long days and long nights, street lights and them cop lights
And getting locked up for the night
When a nigga sitting behind metal bars and writing letters
Getting all the stress off of my shoulders when I'm under pressure
Only person who can keep me from going insane in my brain
Taking a trip right down memory lane
Back in the day

Hook:
Back in the day, like back in the day
Back in the day, like back in the day
Back in the day, do you remember those days?
Back in the day, back- back in the day
When I was lost for words I'd get 'em back in a day
When yo feelings ran away you got 'em back in a day
I'm actin' like I don't know you, 'cause you be actin so strange
Walking down memory lane
Thinking back in the, ba- back in the day
Girl all we have is our memories, girl all we have is our memories
Said all we have is our memories, I just hope that you'll remember me
From back in the day...
