[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Gold chain and some J’s like Nas in Illmatic
I’m so real, I’m something to feel, peel fabric
My folks kill, they hunt every meal, meat cabbage
Lyrically get out my way, protein the beats radish
Roll the weed LB the police smell me
High profile, sweet, bring them hoes to the tele Nah
Bitches fuck your shit up words from DMX in Belly behind you back
Planning your downfall, I thought that was your relly-
Relative, skin of ribs and eat healthy
I belch a bitch and leave her tits on a shelving
I felt a bitch, she let me in, welcoming
Fuck duct tape nigga, I like Velcro-ing
I ain’t the one to be tampered with
I make you shit all in your pants and your pamper, bitch
Niggas quick to sing a hook and make a dance up quick
For you it’s never or never, my camp’s legit

[Interlude]
Wolf Gang! Fuck your crew, nigga! This Wolf Gang, nigga!
Go the fuck home, mutherfucker! Night night, mother fucker!
Smoke up, Left Brain!

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Snow so white, moon so bright
They’re on a playground making canines fight
Ain’t no place for my kids to go

[Verse 2]
The wolves are rowdy and in the parking lot
I don’t mean basketball when I say that they be balling in the park a lot
It’s like the big bad wolf duplicated
If they getting shitted on by critics, it’s cool, they super rated
Life on the huge and playlist, daily’s the fucking basis
Accounting for all the hatred, get off the children’s sacred
I’m international, actual but in fact I go from
The US to the UK to Amsterdam in like two days

[Hook]
Snow so white, moon so bright
They’re on a playground making canines fight
Ain’t no place for my kids to go
