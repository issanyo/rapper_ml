(Yeah)

Odd Future
Fiends notice notice me when I step in the club
I'm VIP so I ain't gotta pay a dub
I see mami shaking it up, shakin her butt
She knew she was hot, You could see it in her strut
I ain't sitting around, but tryin to see what you about
Plus I feel lucky cause the bent' coupes out
Shorty wearing a skirt, Hawaiian style
(?)
Then to the next chick, seen her on the left switch
She the type when I wake up I smell breakfast
Walking up on me by my next mix
Listen up the girl like (?)
Odd Future (?)
Even if you let me I wouldn’t stand it

Pop pop pop pop pop
Pop pop pop pop pop Then make that ass
Drop drop drop drop drop
Drop drop drop drop drop

It’s Odd Future in the shit

Ladies ready to party

Try the best to get it started

Hodgy keep you falling at you looking at the shits

By the grand daddy pup so we can twist
