[Verse: 1]

Don't fuck with me, I'm an alcoholic
Flow sick, need alka-seltzer
I smoke weed and get hyperbolic
Mary, mary, mary like I'm catholic
No drink for a month keep the gin and tonic
I race through life like super sonic
Roll 1 up OG no chronic
Sparked the flame now I'm demonic
From the 609 curse words ebonic
She fucking me my dick she on it
Pretty face, titties, ass, all the components
She gotta be bad to give me atonement
God forgive me, god dam, god darn it
Murder lyrics other than that I'm homeless
Full plate finish what i started
Im out my mind, insane, retarted
