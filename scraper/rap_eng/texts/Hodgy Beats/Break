[Verse 1: Hodgy]

You've come a long way, a long way you gotta go
And if you reach the end of the road, a pot of gold
Some people have no pot to piss, nor pot to hold
And I smoke pot by the oz. my green garden grows
Ashes on my mattress, where's that ashtray shell catcher?
This cloud supreme cal king ain't cheap
You can ask my sheets
When the wolves are on the creep, you can count the sheep
And guess who gotta woody finna hit Bo Peep
I toy with stories from shorties who come escort me
From my limousine, to the demons I see
Who breathe the unliving beings
I'm just a living being, living - being
I'm just a kid that screams that fiends his dreams
They want to critique me negatively but who really cares
This air and land we share, there's no need to compare
Find peace within yourself and
Make peace with everyone else
Pick up your phone and call support
When in need of some help

[Hook]
Womp Womp Womp
Womp Womp Womp

[Outro]
Life is so simple. Life is so precious
Life is everything, Everything to me
Life is so simple. Life is so precious
Life is everything, Everything to me
It sounds like the oceans in here
All the commotion in here
Motion is fear. Open your ears
