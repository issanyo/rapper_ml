[Intro]
You know I do my best to keep it real with myself. Fuck you and your suggestions, you question

[Verse 1]
I'm wiser with my time, it's precious
I'm writing songs all day long, think it's cramped up and [?]
Practice makes perfect so I rehearse what's on my setlist
Don't need diamonds or necklaces, people around me be desperate
That's food for thought so when you eat make sure you digesting it
I use my manners at the table, got etiquette
Red and fish pesciterian, beef is what it never is
[?] aquarium
If I'm staring at him, I'm daring him
Problems are cleared to happen [?] man, I'm wearing 'em
It's conjested like a sneeze when you're sharing germs
Niggas just here to play when Hodgy came here to learn
I look my son in the face told him stay away from freezer burns
Turn around and watch your back and back away from evil firms
Trenton I made a promise to you that I won't be feeble
Scriptures on the notepad, somebody drop the needle

[Hook]
It's a double edge sword, it's a double edge sword
It's a double edge sword, it's a double edge
It's a double edge sword, it's a double edge sword
It's a double edge sword, it's a double edge
Double edge sword, it's a double edge sword
It's a double edge sword, it's a double edge
Double edge sword, double edge sword
Sharper than a tongue

[Verse 2]
There's a ribbon in the sky on cloud nine, I cut it
Dive in the verses head first, I headbutt it
You see a nigga for who he is like he wears nothing
You judging me for my past, call that unfair rubbish
Don't hold me to my mistakes, don't hold don't hold on to your judgement
I do whatever it takes to live beyond above it
I'm coming from the shoulders like I fire muskets
Knowing that life ain't easy, they saying easy does it
Recording at home speaking reaching the streets to public
Service announcements, my turn to keep balance
Through the night I fight my vices, I'm gallant
I'm never impressed with by playing chess or checkers, astounded
By all these fake people that claim to be family, I can't be around it
Put the dogs and pound it, [?] round it
I'm troublesome walking out the double doors
Don't push me bitch, I'm on the edge like a double edge sword

[Bridge]
It's a double edge sword, double edge sword, sword

[Hook]
It's a double edge sword, it's a double edge sword
It's a double edge sword, it's a double edge
It's a double edge sword, it's a double edge sword
It's a double edge sword, it's a double edge
Double edge sword, it's a double edge sword
It's a double edge sword, it's a double edge
Double edge sword, double edge sword
Sharper than a tongue
Sharper than a tongue
Sharper than a tongue
Sharper than a tongue
Sharper than a tongue
Sharper than a tongue
Sharper than a tongue

[Outro]
Watch your mouth
And as I continue, I want you to witness greatness. Sometimes greatness can't hold hand with greatness
