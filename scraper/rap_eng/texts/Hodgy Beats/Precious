[Chorus]
Precious
Precious
Precious
Precious

[Verse 1]
You taking my time with your appointment, tender appointment
Lead me to disappointment
Lead me to a day that ain't consumed with your shit
Rather sit and enjoy this time, this time, this time is

[Chorus]
Precious, hey
This time is precious, c'mon
This time is precious
This time, this time, this-this time, this time is precious
Don't forget, one more time

[Interlude]
Now can one of you gentlemen please tell me, w-what is time worth?
All your money
We can only subtract time and you can't get back time, baby, time is worth
More than money
Have you ever heard a virgin say "I'ma pay you for your time?", you wanna know why 'cause time is worth
More your money
More than money, don't waste your time it's worth
More your money

[Verse 2]
Mad funny like a a blast from the past mummy
I ordered take-away, it didn't come for me
Cross the law and the border for law and order
Never dying is called immortal
Walking through the portal
Swore I'd come back from it
Assumptions sort of borderline adorable, yeah
Time is flash forward

[Verse 3]
You ran from me before, got away, but not this time
Time after time, a thin line
Let brick and pots of gold close the rain form into Cloud 9
Form into Cloud 9
Hey, this time is

[Chorus]
Precious, hey
C'mon, this time is precious
This time, this time, this-this time, this time is precious
This time is precious, hey
Precious
Don't forget, one more time
This time is precious
Precious
This time is precious
