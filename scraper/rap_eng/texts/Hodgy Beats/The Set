[Verse 1]
Momma said never be thirsty in a rain storm
When she handed me a bucket's when I brain strorm
I'm after money not the snatch, like when your chain's gone
I hit the ground, I'm airborne nigga ping-pong
Heart beat thumping on my chest King Kong
Don't keep calm, [?] ching-chong
I'm fucking awesome aka [?]
Them boys are screaming when I'm squeezing machine guns
Ride around with the safety off cause the world ain't safe man I promise
Rather graduate from the streets than be a scholar in college
Got a lot of hoes around my way, I know that I can't trust 'em
Wanna cuddle like a teddy bear with a plastic nose and them buttons
I'm grateful, never greedy never glutton
Turn the beast into me [?] records all of a sudden
I'm breakable, ain't invincible, you can touch it
You hater fools are miniscule I'm thugging motherfucker

[Hook]
Same old project, same old corner
Take me to where I haven't been before
I'm rolling through the set, I'm rolling through the set
Same old hood rats slangin' on the corner
That street life, [?]
I'm rolling through the set, I'm rolling through the set

[Verse 2]
Back up in this ho like I never left
It took a minute, told 'em I be back in a sec
Had to go to war and figure it out then come back [?]
You thirsty for the [?] and bitch [?]
Keep them squares out of circle like [?]
I pay homage in full, cash or check or an AMEX?
I saw you on your street, I should've swept it
Family is all I got, they are who I was blessed with
I got a couple [?]
Take your porage and leave you eggless and breakfast
Rapping for entertainers like my nigga Cedric
[?]
Nigga I'm switching lanes in that Coup de Ville
Banging Snoop and Scoop deville
I see niggas [?]
[?]
I'm too forreal and I'm super ill
Remain the same on [?]

[Hook]
