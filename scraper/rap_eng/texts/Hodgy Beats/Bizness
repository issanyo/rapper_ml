[Intro: Hodgy Beats]
Oh life
So good, so good yeah
What you gon' do this life
What you gon' do, what you gon' do in life
So good, so good
So good

[Hook: Hodgy Beats]
I'ma take care of my business, I'ma take care of my business
Nigga lord as my witness, don't need no other fucking witness
I'ma take care of my business, take care of my business
Take care of my business on these bitch ass nigass
I'ma take care of my business
I'ma play the fucking game just like it's tennis
After the fucking match you gon' bet that I'm gon' win it
I'ma take care, take care, man take care of my business
I'ma take care of my business, the lord as my witness nigga

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Life of the struggle, all I know is trouble
Gripping my peace while tryna put the pieces to the puzzle
Life of a hustler
Motherfuckers rather see me dead
I'm stacking bread, need a prayer
Don't know what's planted inside I these niggas' heads
I waited years to see my momma smile
It's been a while [?] off of niggas heads
Burning corners burning Michellin tires spinnin' rims over potholes
I keep my head up for [?] with snot nose
This rap is fire ready to explode like [?]
Having diamonds and golds means you've accomplished some goals
I'm spitting flames and fire like I'm burning coals
Bitch I will never erode, I'm growing like a mote
Big stick, I'm never coming short, I'm not a chode
If the road got a brick on it, it's a golden road
You know too much, I know nothing
I only know my soul
You striking out for the paparazzi, I'll strike a pose

[Hook: Hodgy Beats]
I'ma take care of my business, I'ma take care of my business
Nigga lord as my witness, don't need no other fucking witness
I'ma take care of my business, take care of my business
Take care of my business on these bitch ass nigass
I'ma take care of my business
I'ma play the fucking game just like it's tennis
After the fucking match you gon' bet that I'm gon' win it
I'ma take care, take care, man take care of my business
I'ma take care of my business, the lord as my witness nigga

[Verse 2: Rarri]
I had to take care of my business
The lord know I'm sinning
But he know I had to get it
Had to make it through the women yeah
I had to whip up up that chicken
I had to put that shit up in the fender
Had to swipe it like it's Tinder yeah
My momma told me if they fear me then they won't get near me
And come the closest nigga to me, he will fucking kill me
The streets ain't never had no heart so I'm inferior
Had to keep that spark in my interior
I know I'm praying to the lord, is he hearing us?
My niggas don't believe in God, believe in Benjamin
That money take you out the ghetto, rock it like a gold medal
To a nickle put that bass into your treble
Lord, lord, lord
Only bitch I'm fucking trusting is Medusa and my nina
Baby girl and she will shoot ya
And if you want it nigga, all my niggas do ya
Only living for that blue'll make you bluer
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Hodgy Beats]
We come from the slums
If you understand where I'm coming from
Then you know where I'm from

[Hook: Hodgy Beats]
I'ma take care of my business, I'ma take care of my business
Nigga lord as my witness, don't need no other fucking witness
I'ma take care of my business, take care of my business
Take care of my business on these bitch ass nigass
I'ma take care of my business
I'ma play the fucking game just like it's tennis
After the fucking match you gon' bet that I'm gon' win it
I'ma take care, take care, man take care of my business
I'ma take care of my business, the lord as my witness nigga
