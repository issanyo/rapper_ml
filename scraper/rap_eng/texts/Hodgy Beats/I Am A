[Intro]
Little something to smoke to
Roll a L, light a L, yeah
HB, LB on the beat

[Verse 1]
I'm alone and I'm throwin' stones
And sticks at a niggas home tryin' to put a bitch in a nigga stone
One of the most sayings said to get a niggas own
I follow that motto, 'til a youngin' hit the lotto
Hit the jackpot like a kid to gelato
Stuntin' in the lobby, Palazzo
What happens stays in Vegas, never spill it, garbanzos
Spittin' hot shit man and it's burnin' my tonsils
Fuckin' bitches in a foreign hotel
Hostile, 'bout to head to a brothel
When you wanna go feels like they can't stop you
How thoughtful, karma comes back when you step to the crossroads
Your whole life you was searchin' for your lost souls
Zombies roam earth, inside of them is hollow
A world where the deep ends shallow
Cold like Capone love Gallo
Surrounded by combination of all kinds of hatred
I don't have the time of day for you to keep me up to date with
Hey bitch, ain't nothin' to play with
Don't say shit rule number one is basic
Headed to Pluto then the moon on my spaceship
I'm doomed to be kaboomed drop your [?] into a playlist
Grateful for salivating Vyron on his greatness
No pressure I'm weightless, uh

[Verse 2]
Burnin' bubblegum and girl scout cookies
I sit aside and let the hot lip [?]
K.O.P, kush over pussy I'm short don't overlook me
Snakes and traps in the grass I had to cut the bushes, plus the bullshit
Mhmm, mhmm, I'm Hodgy Beats, lil' bitch I do it to the fullest
Catch me at 99% and I'm gon' have to bite the bullet
You callin' truces, my will is bruces, I'm a son of a music
Fluently reclusive, the boot is where the noose is
The blueprints draw out my future, no future, dear
Smokin' 'til its food I get
Gotta stack money cause frugal as [?]
Surrounded by my pride, searchin' for a peace of mind
Heard it, knowin' it's goin' be fine
Workin' 'til my hearin' declines
Knowin' what I'm deservin' this time
I swear they every word in my rhymes, nigga
I swear they every word in my rhymes, nigga

[Sample]

[Verse 3]
In this world theres drama, so I'mma plan it loosely
Force myself to retreat, no plans with groupies
All these bitches wanna suck on this cold, organic smoothie
At times I give a fuck and join her for her orgasmic movies
She call my phone like "I am alone" when I ain't alone
Should I pick up, or silence the tone to her
I am the tone, just violent
Never really quite at her home, she's cryin'
Knowin' she'd be better on her own, inside it's
Like mine is cold climate that's why she
Stuck to my side like we're Siamese
Coward in this world, can't [?]
Two tommys for niggas tryin' to two time me
I hate the serve salami pastrami
Sometimes you have to, to see your shows at the back you
[?]
Niggas pressin' charges, so I kick back play bashful
But knowin' I would bash skulls if I had to
I'mma stay in my habits so have your attitude
Ungrateful for this altitude, uh
