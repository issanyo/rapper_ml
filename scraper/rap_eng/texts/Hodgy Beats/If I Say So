[Hook: Hit-Boy]
This shit'll go up if I say so
This shit'll go up if I say so
This shit'll go up if I say so
This shit'll go up if I say so
Ho, wanna play big bank take lil' bank
I got bands on me now
I got bands on me now
I got bands on me now
Ho, wanna play big bank take lil' bank
I got bands on me now
I got bands on me now
I got bands on me now

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Somebody call me a boat
So I can fill it with models after the show
Doin' the most, champagne off of the coast
Pull up the shore and hop in the ghost
Got damn I need rest
I'm gettin' a drainin' amount of requests
I wake up to bitches and bacon and sex
The livin', the legend, the man in the flesh

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
The bands I'm countin' in my hand, I can't fold
Multiple bank accounts for money it can't hold
Yellow canaries in the rose tan gold
My fellowship been about Benjamins, [?]
Applyin' the pressure, a diamond so precious
Tear it down for when it's war time, I roll on your Lexus
If it ain't expensive, I ain't eatin' it for breakfast
It's a recession, I'm braggin' without any questions

[Hook: Hit-Boy]

[Verse 3: Hodgy Beats]
Bein' broke is a mindset that I'm not accustomed to
Get that paper, stack that money's all a young nigga do
I put them hoes to work, get out on the street
Treat it like a meet and greet, make sure you're lookin' sweet
Call it the route to Satan, I'm on the roof countin' statements
Back in the booth it was vacant until I filled it, hoes face it

[Verse 1] + [Hook]
