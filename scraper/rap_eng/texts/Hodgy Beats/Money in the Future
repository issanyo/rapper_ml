Hodgy beats, Beats4Clothes...
Ha...what's good? What's good LA?
What's up dena? yeah... what's up west coast?

[Verse 1]
Uh...what you think about me?
When I bar at the bar you are drinking for free
Damn... what you thinking of me?
Sixteen in the clouds when I sit in the tree
I open up my thoughts like a cabinet
Use the can opener right after I grab it
Where you going to be?
Cause I'm busy and I got a lot going for me
If you got a hot beat nigga, throw it to me
Beats are like weed, I 'ma blow 'em for free
I just roll 'em up in a Swisher
Used to ask my mother don't tell my little sister
She looks up to what I find a disappointment
I can't cut her deep in it, hair louin ointment
Cause that wouldn't cover up the wound
I'm goin' on a trip, I'll be home soon

[Hook]
I gotta have money in the future
I gotta feel success
I gotta have money in the future
Cause right now I'm stressed, right now I'm stressed
I need money in the future
I need money in the future
I need a odd future
I need a odd future

[Verse 2]
Music is my life to be honest
When I speak it's definite, a definite promise
Screw you and the Wall with a big nail
Pirate overseas like Pippy with her pigtails
Stranded on the side of a... Caribbean
Land in water like a damn amphibian
Shout out to Beats4Clothes
Cause they do it for love that's what means the most
I'm Hodgy Beats, I don't mean to boast
But cups in the air for the love to the team I toast
I spas on tracks like I'm mentally bananas
Get a little better every time I change a stanza
Show or tell 'round school odd future campus
We're certified, stamp us
How can we live without the future?
I have nothing else to give without the future...

[Hook]
I gotta have money in the future
I gotta feel success
I gotta have money in the future
Cause right now I'm stressed, right now I'm stressed
I need money in the future
I need money in the future
I need a odd future
I need a odd future

You know I was just thinking
About what really matters in life
You know? haha get at me...
