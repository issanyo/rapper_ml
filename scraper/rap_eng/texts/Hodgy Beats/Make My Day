[Intro]
So I met this chick man
And it was crazy the way I met her
I mean I was feeling down that day
You know what I'm saying, I was right
There in the gutter somewhere
And she had just passed my pathway
And I was just like yo
All she had to do was turn around and smile yo
And that just made my day

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Simple but in love with 'em, dimples and she loving them
Button-up buttoned, ironed well and tucked it in
Teeth yellow whiten 'em hormonal raised vicodin
Many came invite 'em in, crack a smile and likin' 'em
First joke try again bad joke she liked it then
I heard me and you sounded exciting
Talk with your eyes and speak with your tits
Always showing up fresh with a brand new fit
My car smell good, girl that's a brand new whip
I'm not the kind of dude that will hand you chips
Hand full of dick, pull over the whip shift the manual stick
Uh, take you to ecstasy, I get to see what other niggas never
Get to see, I am someone these other niggas sweat to be
Cause you next to me girl you next to me
I know they can't fit they feet in my shoes, its like
They're running fast but they always lose to me

[Hook]
I wanna please you in every way (cause you, cause you)
Cause you make my day
When you say you 'bout to leave I just want you to stay
(cause you, cause you) cause you make my day x2

[Verse 2]
I'm a straight shooter
If I ain't got the car to see your face I scooter
Taking mental photos brain's a Mac computer
Girl scout but dammit she my fine little trooper
All we need is eachother
No C's in her uter-us, take a ride on cupid, bus
Just me and you
Don't bring your girls I reserved seats for 2
Besides think of all the things we can do, we should do
Bring my ? thong and the reefer too
I wanna open up your eyes then open up a lie then I open up
Your thighs and you open up and cry, look up, the dope is in the sky
So we coast up in the ride to commit to suicide
Doors that is, if I can have you no more whores that's it
Erase my contacts and I change my number
Then threw out the heels out the trunk of the hummer

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm rapped at the fact we get personal
So when you yappin I just snap and get personal
Grab your purse that's all I'm sorry it hurt that's all
? and call, I know I ain't as pisces as your are
But you lookin' at the sun and make it shine
Like a blue star I'm turned on by a few stars
Oh and you star and its just who you are
Uno, astronaut, Star Trek, and Pluto my diamond girl big
You can see it through my pupil's
Sweet like fructose I'm sour as a sourhead
Sour red more red than the rose before the flower dead
Never blow off the top we hold out with heads
And take anger by the second to the hour spreads
That's called a relationship, one man loved
Though he passed don't you hate this shit?
And I'm happy cause you by my side
But if you ask me to ride I got nothing to hide

[Hook]
