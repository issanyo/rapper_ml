[Intro]
Long road, destination so far
Let go, let go of all hesitation, put faith in mind
Yes I did
With all that faith you got
Negative thinking got you thinking that your situation going all wrong
Emotion seeping through the pen and I'm grieving through the fog
That's when I come up with the best ideas

[Verse 1]
The fear in your tears
Wipe the mirror till it's a clear smear
There there, here nor there visions aware
Away from despair, visited there, sat in a chair
Adapt in the air, sat in a Ferris Wheel, it feels like wheelchair
Square one square [?]
There's a unfair [?]
Then realize no one's there and no one cares
When you look, no one stares
And no one's there [?]

[Chorus]
We wanna be accepted, we want freedom
Last resort is to fight and if we got it, we'll beat 'em
Defend our kingdom at night and abide it by the evening
Survival of the fittest in the Garden of Eden

[Verse 2]
I got my mind and my heart, I had to split 'em up
They're too close apart
Twisted long roads, send a long [?]
I'm just a lost soul
Playing [?]
World Mario Kart
And the kart goes *zooooom*
And I pull out my heart
And my heart slows down
Asleep making no sound
[?] carry it, cherish it
Your most wanted embarrasment
Hearing this fears in your tears
From the rear of your ear
[?] your fears
[?] repeat at loss that you caught, Randy Moss
Need some floss, the cheap is talk
[?] talks and [?] talks
And you know who else runs their mouth, demons dog
Running wide with a stampede [?]
For real guys, start to realize I need Jesus dog
Martin Luther had a dream that he would free us all

[Chorus]
We wanna be accepted, we want freedom
Last resort is to fight and if we got it, we'll beat 'em
Defend our kingdom at night and abide it by the evening
Survival of the fittest in the Garden of Eden

[Outro]
Long road, destination so far
Let go, let go of all hesitation, put faith in mind
Yes I did
With all that faith you got
Negative [?] your situation got it going all wrong
Emotion seeping through, [?] grieving through the fog
That's  when I come up with the best ideas
