Why must I push limits go hard
Been this way since I dug holes in backyards
From the backyard to the block
From the block to the school of hard knocks and no one answers
I'm the boy that cried wolf, nigga fuck a panther
The devils in a dress tear him out to dance with
I shining before I'm rising across the horizon
Niggas behind me like the man from Verizon
Oh, well connected, swell affected, Hell injected
Ima' go rebel a blessing, sell a rec. And now those sort of scales are tested
Hail domestic and t-t-tell the message
Made mistakes learned from the consequences, running from police hopping fences
Relentless I'm in this, you know this, my motives, exploding eroding your whole team

[Hook]
I rock, I win, I conquer, I soar
This is not the end, be back for more
I rock, I win, I conquer, I soar
This is not the end, not the end
I rock, I win, I conquer, I soar
This is not the end, be back for war
I rock, I win, I conquer, I soar
This is not the end, not the end

Why must I push limits go hard
Nobody will ??? against our lives
Nobody will run for us, ??? turn guys
You're crazy ??? in disguise, and that's a possession of fraud
You gotta know about the law, I ain't fuckin' with the law
That GD sheriff standing next to me, I jet and ski
Something you'll never own to do, I'm hotter than a bowl of soup
I'll turn a dollar into two, ..Mmm.. now what you know about that
Number five on the charts fuck a sound track, aim for the skies hit the ground flat
I'm rubber and you're glue, It'll bounce back
What you say nigga what you say? I'll cut you like a track before my kung fu cake
Show up in all black like my names Bruce Wayne, white bitches in my Lambo giving me brain

[Hook]
I rock, I win, I conquer, I soar
This is not the end, be back for more
I rock, I win, I conquer, I soar
This is not the end, not the end
I rock, I win, I conquer, I soar
This is not the end, be back for war
I rock, I win, I conquer, I soar
This is not the end, not the end
