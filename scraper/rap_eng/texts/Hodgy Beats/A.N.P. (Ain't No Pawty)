You can't call your shit a party if you kick back at your party
Sipping gin for the win
Spill it in your broad's Bacardi
And she freaking cause she naughty
And she freaking cause she naughty

[Verse 1: Mike G]
I've been trying to get to you in any way possible
I just want you to show me how you walk like a model
Your [?] and [?] you could kill 'em all without a voice and
Red lipstick is your weapon of choice, yeah
Do it for a purpose if you work it, don't switch
If you ain't making money, what you twerking for bitch?
Hit the block, nine to five
Work on you ten to six
Just to add you to a list of my accomplishments
We be coming up in ways you couldn't touch
You trying to get on the bus but you can't sit with us
You ain't saying nothing if you ain't paying up
The way that she moving seem to have me stuck
You standing like a manican dipped in glue
I'm on the warped tour too with my selective few
It's a Mike G party, I came to get it started
Like we the [?]
I'm sorry for never calling you

[Verse 2: Mike G]
How you tell something that's on fire to stop smoking
If they ain't paying then I tell'em stop joking
I wear checker boards and [?] when I rhyme
Stepping on flights on tours like crossing the finish line
She ask about my days in LA
All I do is cruise and blaze my mind in a haze
I say if I'm the coldest in the summertime
I could put the streets in a craze like black fridays
See Left Brain beats sound like all white minks
Sitting on plush custom named monogram seats
Surfing down pure platinum paved gold streets
Crowd cheers run deep like you rose from defeat
Make you think you could be whatever you want to be
With hard work, you acquire everything you seek
Don't preach, not first for you step in to speak
I'm Jack Frost and King in one, please believe
