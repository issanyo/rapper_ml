[Intro]
Nigga

[Verse 1]
I never put my armor on, I got a squire
A water pail to put out a devilish fire
Word to Prince, only women I'm 'bout to hire
I'll fire 'em when I overdose or retire
Work to see my kids like I'm Mrs. Doubtfire
I lie when I tell the truth, consider me a liar
Niggas be reaching but they don't be reaching higher
I burn blunts and they be burning out like screeching tires
I'm 25er, call me the bigger homie
Niggas be geeked up, suicidal, and phony
Shout out to Mark Williams from Columbia Sony
If you know my work I feel you know me
If you don't know my work suck my right and left cojone
I'm genuine like Ginuwine bitch ride my pony
2016 I'm Gucci, don't try to clone me
Not "Me, Myself, and Irene", just me and my lonely nigga

[Hook]
Man all these hoes be in a circuit
Passed around like popcorn in a circus
Work it, work it baby, work it, work it
You on your job, fuck it show me how you twerk it, ok
Show me how you do your thing, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm killing it, ripping shit
I tell them not to rip or kill no shit, bitch I'm a hypocrite
Got a 380 by my hip and shit
Man I'm just charging my crystals, I'm on my hippy shit
Like there's a crack in the concrete man I be tripping shit
Taking trips to Australia with a bitch I just hit
A hundred-and-forty acres, two hundred horses
Man she rich as shit
She can have my fucking kid for my citizenship, nigga
Rub my genie lamp wrong, I'm dismissing it
If I take a drink, thirty minutes later I'm belligerent
These bitches playing the victim like they all innocent
They get a hit up, I'm coming up by the increment
My phone blowing up, I don't pick up cause it's long distances
My mind react if you intrude my premises
I don't play a game like a fucking Sega Genesis
I'm a menace, blacked out on Hennessy
(Show me how you do your thing, yeah yeah)

[Hook]
Man all these hoes be in a circuit
Passed around like popcorn in a circus
Work it, work it baby, work it, work it
You on your job, fuck it show me how you twerk it, ok
Oh yeah, yeah yeah
