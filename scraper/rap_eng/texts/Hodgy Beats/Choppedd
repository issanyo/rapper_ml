[Hook]
Can't say I wasn't real with you
Can't say I wasn't real with you
Can't say I wasn't real with you
Can't say I wasn't real, can't say I wasn't real
Can't say I wasn't real with you
Can't say I wasn't real with you
All that shit you had me put up with it
And I still deal with you
Can't say I wasn't real with you
Can't say I wasn't real with you
Can't say I wasn't real
Can't say I wasn't real with you
Can't say I wasn't real with you
Can't say I wasn't real with you
Can't say, can't say that I wasn't real

[Verse]
Sometimes we have problems
Normally we have sex
Fucking you baby, that's a problem
Cause I always want next
Hopped out the bed and flexed on the sweats
It was your birthday and you like it from the sweat
Waking up man, she looking through my texts
Here we go, another argument

I take [?]
Buy you the flyest clothes
This pain inside you try to hide, it shows it shows
You question me from time to time, you [?]
But you [?] things that I did before
That's in the rearview mirror
We're moving fast in the [?]
Kinda strange
Highway control them niggas on the way
Time to get the show on the road, baby ondelay
We got narcotics in the trunk
Pills and all the yay
It's me my girl against the world
Beyonce and Jay

[Bridge]
Love fades away
Love fades away
Love fades away
Love fades away
Love fades away
Love fades away
That's why I tell that shit to stay away
Love fades away
Love fades away
Love fades away
