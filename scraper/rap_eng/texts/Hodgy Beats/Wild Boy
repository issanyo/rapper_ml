[Hook]
I don't skateboard but I spit fire
It's a lit fire, nigga pit fire
Hodgy Beats, his own Empire
And he ain't washed up like a riptide
Big body's sitting outside
No tint so you see me riding inside
Just me and like ten dimes
Hotboxing, getting faded off the incline
You donâ€™t skate to keep it in line
Cause I'm a wild boy
Bitch, I'm a wild boy
Keep it in line cause I'm a wild boy
Bitch, I'm a wild boy
Stay in line, cause I'm a wild boy
Like Emmet I got that wild style, boy
Hodgy Daddy's on the mic, you a child boy

[Verse 1]
I got a lot of people up in my circle
Keep my circle small like the shirts on Urkel
Like a [?] nurse, so I'm smoking purple
And I'm hardly nervous, only when there's turbulence
Think the plane gon' crash, earphones on blast
We leak Black Sabbath up in this class
When I was in high school, I never finished class
I was out getting money, selling nicklebags nigga
5, 15, 20, 25, 30
35, 40, been this fucking early
I was sixteen years old pouring syrup in Shirley
[?] we turn up til we're hurling
Shroom with a girl and we swoon, like she's Sterling
[?] it's white and it's pearly
I'm thinking about fucker her, her mind is dirty
She rolling up drugs [?] we bump this shit in Berkeley

[Bridge]
I got a bunch of niggas with me, ready to raise the crime rate
This .45 ain't mine, I set her up for blind date
I'ma smoke this marijuana til I meet my dying day
Keef on the bottom of the grinder like the [?] of Bombay

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm a live wire, get it paid in full like Mekhi Phifer
[?] these white liars
The day that I die is the day I drive Viper
24 hours of spitters like rhyming cyphers
If rapping was a crime cause they had to indite us
But it's not so I [?] invited
What you got to say, where them haters at?
Buying all this Haterade, I thought I fucking paid you back
Carry my whole city on my shoulders like a piggy back
Laughing to the piggy bank, smoking on a different batch
Mix and match, [?]
[?]
My life is real and I ain't finna act
Come correct if you incorrect
Yeah, Hodgy nigga
