[Intro: Hodgy Beats]
OF...OF...

[Verse: Hodgy Beats]
I-I-I always hop to music like I was hip
The thought a chip in my pocket made a nigga spit
My race was first place, yours was fourth and fifth
I go to the main course if the source legit
They ask me about my crew and where the fuck we from
Women pull my wardrobes and can touch me some
Bitches hound me and surround me, they're all puppies son
I chose my pic for the moon, the night has just begun
Begun, Begun, well Ima' end it tonight
I got a pint of lean, stir it in my remix sprite
Sip slow for the fast lane life
Bury less of what is carried as the meanest hype
Go from dirt ditches to riches, broke figures to fixes
Chewing money like Wrigley's
Can't believe it I'm [?]
Here we come man come get with me the mothafucking drum roll
The world is under Odd Futures feet bottom [?] so

[Outro: Hodgy Beats]
We gonna make it (Yeah)
We gonna make it
Life is a bitch
We're gonna strip that bitch naked (Oh)
We gonna make it
We gonna make it
Life is a bitch
So help me strip that bitch naked

Hat, Shirt, Bra, Jeans
Hat, Shirt, Bra, Jeans
Jeans, Bra, Hat, Shirt
Jeans, Bra, Hat, Shirt
