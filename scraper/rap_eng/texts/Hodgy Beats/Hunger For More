[Hook]
I ain't worried about these cowards
Cause they know that I know this world ain't fucking ours
Oh it's mine, oh it's mine
Oh it's mine, oh it's mine, oh it's mine, mine, mine
I ain't worried about no cowards
Cause they know that I know that we know this world won't fade out
Oh it's mine, oh it's mine, oh it's mine
Yeah oh it's mine, oh it's mine, oh it's mine for the taking

[Verse]
It's in my hands, this shit's in my hands
I'ma spit it, let it spit in my hands
Real shit, no fairy tale like Tinkerbell and Peter Pan
I'm a pirate man, I get anxious when I see the land
I'm nothing but heat that's breezing through the fan
And what you see is confusing, it's just an illusion
I keep on bleeding from cutting these newest jams
Nigga following through is what I do with my plans
Stuntin' on 'em, had to push the fucking button on 'em
Had to heat the oven on 'em, make a muffin on 'em
What Hodgy coming for, ain't gon' need no fucking warning
Sting like a hornet that's swarming, this is just a house warming
I say that I'm tired but never fucking yawning
You tired of rapping because you're fucking boring
I'm up til two in the morning, nigga six in the morning morning
They slept on Hodgy, they still sleeping, I'm hearing 'em snoring

If niggas in the hood don't feel your shit
You illegit, you not legitimate
Most of these niggas born bitches, guess what, they still a bitch
If she ain't [?] heels off from the bills you give
Niggas doing life, three strikes and it's still a hit
Screw you, I got the drive like a phillips bitch
I'm struggling whil they alive I might just kill a bitch
[?] while illiterate
Hodgy need extra port-a-potties man he still the shit
When shit get real, you gon' fucking see who the realest is
You gon' fucking see who the realest is
You not walking what you're talking cause your achilles is
I'm on my [?] like Tarzan in the jungle
If you got a problem, you gon' meet who my gorillas is
Push a nigga to read Phillipeans
I'm son of these niggas, at heart still a kid
Got the emergency pack on me, I stun gun 'em
Hospitalize 'em hearing sirens, man the [?]'s coming
Keep it one hundred, never run from nothing
Run through the night, one night stand I would've done 'em
Hand cuffin' 'em, you honey bun 'em
Difference between us is [?] and onions
When the peace is disturbed, just know that I disrupt it
[?] destructive
[?] disgusting
In between the sheets I love it, I love to fucking fuck it
I love to touch it [?] touch a touchy subject
All above it, I never quit do you know what enough is?
Because I've had it and [?] nail it to the casket
I'm attracted, [?] I'm a magnet
I hold my city down like I'm Diddy, don't puff and pass it
Searching for better days and brighter lights than yellow jackets
I work for this, [?] I'm a motherfuckin' addict
And I do infinite to beyond til the galactic
Smoking on Jasmine, I'm Aladdin in the palace
They are them, we are us, we kill 'em, no challenge

[Hook]
And I ain't worried about these cowards
Cause they know that I know this world ain't fucking ours
Oh it's mine, oh it's mine
Oh it's mine, oh it's mine, oh it's mine, mine, mine

[Outro]
Ain't worried bout nothing
I'm out here, I'm out here nigga
