[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Ask clancy if we're hard to manage
From a huddle to a scramble in an omelete sandwich
Ya man's the damage, for the fuck of it I go on a rampage
I be smoking trees hanging in the fucking branches
Rasta koala, higher than a Prada
I father these animals across the safari
Desert Sahara my cheese so ricotta
Composing m-musical movement - sonota
I'm hotter than lava bitch I need a bottle of oxygen
Water out back of Tacoma
Ask me bout Tyler I give him a comma
Start running game I just pass it to Domo
Genesis, and Left Brain in this bitch
Wolf Gang, nigga fuck a membership
You can ask about Mike G, he'll burn you like a chai tea
That was directed to all the haters bitch im Spike Lee

[Hook]
We don't fuck with nobody
But you, you fuck with errbody
See
We don't fuck with nobody
But you, you fuck with errbody
See
We don't fuck with nobody
But you, you fuck with errbody
See
We don't fuck with nobody
But you, you fuck with errbody
See

[Verse 2: Left Brain]
We don't fuck with ya'll but ya'll fuck with us
Wolf Gang nigga in Odd we trust
Rolling hash rolling kush
Mellowhype bitch nigga hold up

[Verse 3: Hodgy Beats]
I'm bringing the problems
Double entendre, triple the drama
Kill your bitch and your mama
Nigga this is an honor
Left produces like a farmer
I'm the guy in the armor
Armed and ready to harm ya
All these magazines think we fucking want their cover?
Critics and bloggers fuck and swallow and fuck each other
Get out my face screw your questions now ask another
Me and Left are getting bread ho, pass the butter
Corn Popped, game on door locked
Pure crop, smoke up it's a sure drop
I don't play that, flagrant for the playback
You fall back and lay back and stay back you stray rat

[Hook]
