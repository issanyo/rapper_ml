[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Today isn't just any occasion
My button-up's a nigga and the jacket's Caucasian
Oh, Black and white crimes is the justification
Gold tie to separate them from their closest relation
Cause shit, a nigga's actions like acceleration
And if I die before you die, I'll be in Hell awaiting
I'm a sick-minded freak, six minds kinda think
Sitcom-blinded geek found life by hide-and-seek
I climb the steep, a few times a week
The line's with skeet, the blondest streak
Life is a bitch cause she kinda sweet
Then go behind your spinal structure cause she sly and weak
Four bars left and I'm-a lie in the street
Where the crosswalk is met by a 90 degree
Two bars and going before the light turn green
One bar and come and blink to the next scene
Bitch I'm a red camera, scannin' all of you amateurs
Me and my dangerous wolves are running Los Angeles
Dope in the can of this canister, green cannabis
Write Mellowhype on the banister, get my analysis
I like how being anal sits, tell 'em stick to the manuscript
I think with the same hand I writ, breakin' grams down
My word's my bond, like I write with my dick, the night is crypt
Bitch, Mellowhype!

[Bridge]
I illustrate the path that I journey
Can't nobody see me, nor can somebody hurt me
Flow contagious like a herpe at the tip of a Slurpie
Straw that you draw in your effective cause friend

[Hook]
Close your eyes, what do you see?

[Verse 2]
I see nothing sometimes, I see nothing but rhymes
Mental crimes, fulfill the lonely chimes and percussion
Melodies of keys are the remedies of these
The only steeze is the snare blowin' smoke in the air
I see the wear-and-tear emotions fallin' off your weary shoulders
Browsin' the I-don't-care folder seems to be the escape
Determination is the key, you gotta let go of faith
And everyone you gave your faith to so faithful
Ungrateful, they make you, and they make you sad
Hop out of your passenger seat heated, catchin' a cab
The fiasco just opened up a closed scab
Sore feelings, more feelings, your feelings collaborate

[Hook]

Breakfast [Verse 1]

As some rise to a sun rise
In the same clothes from yesterdays
Though the umpire is unsound
My team is a squad who works to make a play
Look for tomorrow today is what I always say
Cuz if tomorrow's today then I'm just a blink away
I find my happiness through all of this rappin' shit
If it wasn't for rappin shit Id be present with gats and bricks
The cat that scratch the itch
My skin is irritated
Eyes low from weed smoke shit I'm clearly shaded
Sailin Jerry Shots bottle tops inebriated
Afraid to look in the mirror to see I really made it
I notice an hour pass
I shatter the hour glass
Matter can overpower mass if it really matters
I live in the moment and not a minute after
Count the page numbers
I write the next chapter

[Hook]

My feet are on the ground
But I'mma touch the sky
First Ima roll this L
Light it
And I'mma get real high
But I'mma seize the moment
And you ask why?
Why
I'mma seize the moment
And not let shit pass me
By

[Verse 2]

Walk into the light
I know its gloomy
Find your own way
Um
Eventually you'll see
Life lessons get told more than a eulogy
Cruelty in a crew-a-tee
Stinging like a poolabee
In a crewatee stinging like a pool of bees
You can't smoke if ain't grew the weed
You ain't shit without some jewlery
I got some homegrown and my gold on like what you do to me?
No gun around me
But I murder brutally
Vertibly, suitably
Ready for battle
In a battlefield use my bats for shields
And a mustang horse ridden saddle
Exsists in a world full of hassle
I gotta graduate so I can flip my
Tassle in life
And look forward to whats next
Until death cross my body and my lungs run out of breath
Its OF

[Hook]
