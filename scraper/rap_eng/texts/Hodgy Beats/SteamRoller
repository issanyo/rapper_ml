[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
My money burn
Synonymous to treatment of the fuzzy herb, I keep it G
In places you wishing you and your niggas be
Salute the gang, bitches cheer loud for the winning team
Bring it home, pull it out, break it down, roll it up
Smell it while we rolling down the street, you niggas know it's us
We got that fire, man you niggas know what's up
King Zag papers, Juan the only nigga rolling blunts
Other than that, you lame niggas is wack
Smoking on a J, while I'm smoking on a track
Cliche shit, stay way way far from basic
Kush cologne, I wear mines no K-Swiss
Damn, all I get is high; and brains
From a long-haired mistress preferred skinning light
Prejudice, marijuana evidence
Pipes, bong, vapes got me blown out my element, element

[Hook: Hodgy]
Every single day I smoke (smoke)
Every single day I smoke (I smoke)
Every single day I smoke
Every single day I smoke
I get high, I get high (Grams of the greenback)
I get high, I get high (Grams of the greenback)
I get high, I get high (Grams of the greenback)
I get high, I get high (Grams of the green sacks)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I grasp my intoxication, digital cinema
Third dimension, I can't move, verb suspension
Putting my lips to the purp, hemp burns is tempting
Bitches in the studio and we copped about a quarter
On the phone with her dad, I'm getting high with his daughter
Euphoria, mouth cotton, percent? A hundred
Many places I go or I have went, I'm blunted
Weed, you got it, I want it, I want it if you got weed
T, T-H, H-H, H-C
Out of no eyes, I'm so high, hashish I can provide
In your life, you gotta pick it up, cause I have no ride
When you arrive, I'll be outside loitering
I hate potheads who front like they don't blaze it
Your body needs Mary Jane, nigga, it craves it
I welcome Mary Jane, she doesn't violate
Inhale, exhale, feel the vibe-er-ate
