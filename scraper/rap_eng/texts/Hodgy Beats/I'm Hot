[Intro]
So epic
It's hard to explain
HB, BamBeeno what up man
Feel it, yeah
Feel it
Beautiful night tonight

[Hook]
I never solid liquid nor gas I'm plasma
Attacking faster than an attack with asthma
I'm hot, It's hard to explain
I'm hot, you know my name
I'm hot, I'm cruising (I'm just cruising)
You're not cause you're losing, snoozing

[Verse 1]
Wake up, wake up
Time 12 noon, not 8 o'clock on the dot
Cappuccino hot
Lock the door to the house double check to be practical
Move like the military strategy tactical
Vogue like the magazine, thinkin' I'm vain
Read a section of possession, why don't you flip the page
Dyslexic breakfast with a cup of cappuccino
I fuck raps serving niggas frappuccinos
Passed the bingo and mastered lingo
Black or pinot HB BamBeeno
Collaborating, collaboration
Immaculation, Hip-Hop saturation
Zap a rating, Evaporating
Two active Asians in the back with Haitians
Blowing Jamaican, I spazz, was my gift
Which should never be taken like the movie Taken
Date raping, rape dating
Sold souls for money with no explanation
Build a foundation, grew a plantation
Patiently waiting, thoughts racingly pacing

[Hook]
I never solid liquid nor gas I'm plasma
Attacking faster than an attack with asthma
I'm hot, It's hard to explain
I'm hot, you know my name
I'm hot, I'm cruising (I'm just cruising)
You're not cause you're losing, snoozing

[Verse 2]
If money grew on trees I'd be stuck in the tree sap
Working pollinate, and covered in beeswax
You got nine lives so I'm petting the kitty
She scratching with attachment I'm forgetting she with me
She's using three words, forgetting she tipsy
She told me she was thirsty tea bagging she dips me
Because I Toyota like [?] Tacoma
Stole it from it's owner left it sleep in a coma
Joyriding through the city like Bart and Homer
Take it to a chop-shop, just locate the molars
Bought a [?] canary sized boulder
Am I wearing gauges, lobes to my shoulders?
Unlimited guide, plans no roll over
Roll over broke more to pay the toll soldier
Beating pass [?]
Patent beats scold ya
I know I'm hot but you're the antonym, colder

[Hook]
I never solid liquid nor gas I'm plasma
Attacking faster than an attack with asthma
I'm hot, It's hard to explain
I'm hot, you know my name
I'm hot, I'm cruising (I'm just cruising)
You're not cause you're losing, snoozing
