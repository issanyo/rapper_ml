[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Mr. Anti-Love, Anti-Social, Anti-Visual, Anti-Vocal
I'm bottled in a bottle like a ship built in it
I dream nightmares through the window and my window is tinted
Memories, I can't diminish, preach to me like a minister
Who is her? Single mom raising a menace
A dog wants to ball, green like tennis
Tossing while I'm sleep cuase my minds out the hemisphere
Weird how we end up here
Christmas without a father for my 19th year
My sisters dad wouldn't bother to pick up he phone and call her
He wasn't there for her, so I had to play the father
That's why I'm close, close to the edge
With a 45 Desert Eagle held to my head
Bread to the knife and my butter's a spread
My songs locked away, threw the key to the shed
My life is going downhill, I'm better off dead
Wolf to the fur and the fur must shed
You know Bopeep got us white old sheep
She like a pimp with a cane and some gold teeth
Stake out with my niggas and wait 'til they go sleep
Hard to keep my eyes wide counting more sheep
Egg head nigga and the key is the hatch
Looking far down the road, it seemed so farfetched

[Hook]
The world is unanimous, time manages
Slip like bananas, split quick, can't handle it?
It's difficult when you're on your own
But be on your shit, mothafucka you grown

[Verse 2]
I'm hungry ass known, I'm lonely all alone
You can’t reach me, because I don’t own a phone
I wish I had a clone and that clone had a pops
There with him watching sports, there with him when he shop
Doing dirt in the streets and his pops find out
He done dug himself a hole which you can't climb out
But the hole his dad puts him in is out of love
So he won't get addicted to the crazy life of drugs
Teach him how to love, he ain't gotta be a thug
It’s okay to show affection and give your mom a hug
Why you acting all hard and shit?
Instead of being who you really truly are and shit
For a nigga gon' reach into his car and shit
On some foreign shit, pull your car in a ditch
More niggas fake, less niggas are real
Some do the talking and the rest will kill

[Hook]
