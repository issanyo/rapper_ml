[Intro:]
HB, Hodgy Beats, Just in case you didn’t know me

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I been around the world, like misplaced groceries imma’ go back
Those memories are Kodak take a snap for the throwback
My snapback is my hat, Shaq is on the throwback
My city behind me the hype is climbing up the fucking Brokeback
Jack twisting off the cap and were rolling swishers
Blow that weed like candles lit, first make a couple of wishes
In 2005 I was putting up five to get high
Now we get on my mile high mileage up just to get fly
How’s it feel to be the best? I’m in line waiting to be next
And have to push my way through some money comes when pays due
Mellowhype jersey feeling worthy will cut at paid dues
Odd future reign of terror better wear your rain boots
Man it’s great when you’re the shit When you’re the toilet things get draining
We’re running from the chair you’re on your job you can paint us
Swearing under oaths protected by the umbrella like it’s raining
Got America on her toes so much her toenails breaking

[Hook: Bobby Bland & Hodgy Beats]
Ain't no love, in the heart of the city
Ain't no love, in the heart of time

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I wanna be the perfect pops to my son and he’ll look at me like
“Daddy you’re the greatest, I wanna be just like you”
I tell him, be like me but with a higher IQ
So he can cut through all the fat fluids and water dilute
I bumped my head a couple times putting my hammer to the screw
But I fixed my situation, word of mouth down to the chew
Swallowing and simulate a niggas fate
Jealousy begins to generate the bitter hate
Its leprosy the way it spreads all through the nigga face
Acting like his girlfriend slept with me, now he got some shit to say
He’ll receive this tone that’s deaf from me respectfully
Disrespecting me results in weaponry
Check your speed and all the extra steez Before you’re left to bleed
All I got is appliances nigga, do you know what pressure needs?
I’m a fabulous antagonist, blasphemous rapper talented
The bowel movement, flatulence and urinary callouses

[Hook: Bobby Bland & Hodgy Beats]

[Outro: Hodgy Beats]
Yeah, Hodgy Beats nigga
Just an update. Haha
