(Kids voice: Yooo, yoo, yoo)

[Verse 1: Hodgy] (x4)
I tell a little homie, this is life
I tell these cute bitches, get right
Light a blunt for everybody, get high
Everything is gonna be alright

[Hook: Hodgy]
I'm lyin' on a landslide
With a bag of California to smoke
An ounce of shrooms for nature walks -
And hide and toss invited some of my folks
The ones that was here before the fame
And blame the world for bringing us so close
Family's, build family trees, grow apple-trees
And that's what matters the most

[Verse 2: Left Brain]
(West side)
My stompin' ground, I'm stompin' round in my black vans
MellowHype on my jersey, tattoos on my black hands
Ridin' up in that Chevrolet, smoke weed, everyday
Rest in peace, to that nigga Nate
You fuck niggas, you can't relate
All my niggas up in this bitch
Reppin' golfwang, you ain't even know it
We smokin' on that Bama-Weed, you ain't even grow it
Bitch im on your mind, tell me how it feel
Bitch im on your mind, tell me how it feel

[Verse 3: Hodgy] (Verse 1 repeated)
I tell a little homie, this is life
I tell these cute bitches, get right
Light a blunt for everybody, get high
Everything is gonna be alright

[Hook: Hodgy]
