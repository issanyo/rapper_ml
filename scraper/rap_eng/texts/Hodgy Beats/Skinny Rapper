[Hook]
Scratch, as I attack the facts
I like fat bags and fat stacks but I’m a skinny rapper
As I attack the facts
I like fat bags and fat stacks but I’m a skinny rapper

[Verse 1]
The opposite direction is the way to commute
My obscure being the long trip to commute
When the teacher take a day off who substitutes
Kids balling up paper in class, paper planes, super glue
Stuck as I’m sitting with a pen no pencil
Permanent utensil, exploding with da' mental
Through the wire goes dental become influential
Hell bound with the music when heaven sent you
Horns with the angel wings, Devil cries while the angels sing
Adjacent must be the way that he angle'n
Crooked, if it fights to get away he book it
Over the stove out on the streets after he cook it
Scent prettier then flowers, grout gritty in the showers
I take every single minute, this is my hour
I’ma show you the power
OF, Vyron, Beats the time is ours

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I on my way down the yellow brick road
My conscience grows, grows, glitter is holds
When I reach my destination she seems to glitter with gold
And I lose my mind, selling my soul
Na-na-naa, she sings la-la-laa, over, over she hits the notes
Take a whiff sniff, sniff take a sniff from the nose, seductive
I bow down and propose to the game, it's my other half now I’m gone

[Hook]
