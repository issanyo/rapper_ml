[Hook]
Don't be waiting around, go get it time is now
Nigga don't be waiting around, go get it time is...
What the time is?
Now, now
Don't be waiting around, go get it time is now
Nigga don't be waiting around, go get it time is...

[Verse 1]
Put your energy into the right direction nigga
You gotta be aamirror when the light's deflected nigga
My lows are super low, balance with highs from heaven nigga
Forgive the old you for you, just don't forget 'em nigga
Don't forget who you discredited
The door is closed, lock the shit so you don't let 'em in
Or in a hoodie stashed under my letterman
Cause the weatherman forcasted that it's bout to be cold outside
Never looking down unless I'm zipping my Northface
Or need my Air Forces tied
And everyday's a struggle like Filipinos in Boracay
A man dies on the day he'll be immortalized
If Red Bull could give us wings
That would be the height of my day
Cause private jets make you pay more to fly
I be talking to myself, I see it eye to eye
I disconnected from them trenches using monkey wrenches
My nigga time is...
And if you're waiting

[Hook]
Don't be waiting around, go get it time is now
Nigga don't be waiting around, go get it time is...
What the time is?
Now, now
Don't be waiting around, go get it time is now
Nigga don't be waiting around, go get it time is...

[Verse 2]
They say business is more reliable
You put your thoughts to lyric
They hearing it, it's undeniable
Through all this bullshit I sit in to crack a smile though
See all these fakes in my vision through a kaleidoscope
I talk to ** on the phone and then I found my hope
Low blows from foes
I [?]
[?] them hoes gon' be exposed
I'm [?] blowing smoke from my nostrils
Everything seems impossible
My nigga you can do anything, man it's possible
Let your ego talk before you let your bones show like a fossil do
Your pride is hiding who you are, inside it man it's blocking you
From stopping through
Your focus is immediate
Enjoy the process, the journey's tedious
Practice turns an amateur into an intermediate
Time is speeding man, I slow down and believe in it
The now

Now, now
And if you're waiting...

[Hook]
Don't be waiting around, go get it time is now
Nigga don't be waiting around, go get it time is...
What the time is?
H-O-D-G-Y
Hodgy!
Don't be waiting around, go get it time is now
Nigga don't be waiting around, go get it time is... now
