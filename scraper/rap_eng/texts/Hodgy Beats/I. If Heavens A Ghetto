[Verse 1]
Used to use you you used to be nothin
Then I fell in love an nothin became something
Talk but they bluffin cheap but cheek stuffin'
Fuck with me cousin overseas stuntin'
Tryna do this on my own
I started from the bottom got a million dollar loan
Invested in my home
I'm livin' in a palace
Serving up these drinks baby put it in my chalice
I'm going for the gold like I was a runner
Shooting for the top never stop like a gunner
Remaining at peace when the world at war
All we need is some weed
To even up the score
Spinning in and out of time
Let loose inside my mind
Those who left behind know nothing but that grind
Giving what your owed and owing what your given
Watch out way behind these niggas kill you for your living
Come complement divine
I'm opulent at mind
Preaching what I see but still the words are hard to find
Chokin' on these flows these hoes love it when I rhyme
And Imma come clean I kill your whole team with a 16
