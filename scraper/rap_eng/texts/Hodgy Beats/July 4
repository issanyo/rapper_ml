[Hook]
I love you and it's simple
I just wanna be with you
We could have us some children
Get married, live so simple
I grow hydroponics on our farm
I'm a psycho
I need some CO2
What is that, nitro?
I go so hard
Fireworks on July the 4th

[Verse 1]
July 4th, what should I lie for
I'm getting high more high
This is July 4th
This is July 4th
This is July 4th barbecue
Cooking knowledge like a Harvard school
I'm all on you
You my Barbie, my darling too
We don’t beat, we just artichoke
We're a pair [?]
Only playing games when we at the carnival
And I burn for you, arsenal
Believe in us, you lose touch when you start to lose
Start [?]
[?] the darkest room
I march in unison, march in tune
Tune into [?]
When I'm thinking of you like a thought bubble
All these other [niggas] are garbage, they all trouble
Trying to hop in our space ship take our shuttle
And I'm not doing that
Hit it before and reruin that
I'm not playing it back and reviewing that
That's a thing in the past nigga Mucinex
Sickness, even with the quickness
Your haters sayin' you relayin' it with a quick fix
And love is a fuckin' drug, sniff this
And now I'm addicted to the dipstick

[Hook]
I love you and it's simple
I just wanna be with you
We could have us some children
Get married, live so simple
I grow hydroponics on our farm
[?]
I need some CO2
What is that, nitro?
I go so hard
Fireworks on July the 4th

[Bridge]
[?]
Yeah
So clear
I feel you when you're not here
So clear
You're not the one that I fear
I trust you
Every word that you mumble
[?] humble

[Verse 2]
Shorty got her own work
Sitting on her throne when she comes from work
[?]
I know her worth
She my wife so I serve
She my wife so I serve
I know her worth
I feed her then drink her up
And then I burp
Realistically living
We gon' have some children and I'ma be granddaddy purp
Aunt Jamima I serve
24/7/11, she my [?]
Gettin' on her nerves, I don’t slide; just swerve
If we get pulled over by the police
She gonna take the rap for me
[?]
She pull her phone out of her purse to send me a emoji
Yeah, that's my homie
Ice cold [?] like emoji
All my brodies know that she's my brodie
[?] lonely
We check for new balance, don't need [?]
Talk is cheap, show me
Run your feet on me
Come from the jungles, I beast on it

[Hook]
I love you and it's simple
I just wanna be with you
We could have us some children
Get married, live so simple
