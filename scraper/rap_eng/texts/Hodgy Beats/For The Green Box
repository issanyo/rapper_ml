The potency is poetry to my floetry
Bitch you know its me
Like go to sleep, I'm wide awake
The prize, the fate, behind my face
Inside my mind I come to find
More than a grind, my weed is prime
My bitches fine, they ass, behind
Equiangular, polygon
I'm one of the best in the league
Other players don't wanna mess up to me
Cause I kill em all professionally
I be beef, you niggas vegetable meat
Right next to my drink, tea, green, mint
What I say is what I mean, pimp
So don't ever claim a g's wimp
I leave you fuckers cheese, Swiss, with a swiss army
Don't fuck around with this army
Niggas organized like a big Tommy
Clip extended to end the friendship
Nigga, karma's endless
I feel bad about the shit that I do
If you were me, you couldn't be mad at all the shit that I do
I'm a shark, I can't swim in the pool
I eat fishes, and there's so many fish in the ocean, I sleep with em
More freaks in the club than Sunset, on a late night
Me, I'm in the bar drunk, feeling like a great white
Big Willy, the kid's silly
I'm worth about a milli
