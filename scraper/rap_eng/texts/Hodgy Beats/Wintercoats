[Intro: Hodgy Beats]
I'd never thought I'd rap on this beat, but *clears throat*
Imma rap on this beat
Yea
Nigga, I'm like a quarterback, on yard one, of the opposing team's side
Imma run for the touchdown

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Different wavelengths and frequencies
Grown men, child delinquencies
What the difference is?
Skeletons in my closet but I'm not secretive
Open the door, they peeking in
Thinking strength make you stronger but what about weaknesses?
Man, I'm finding what my uniqueness is
I been working on my meekness
While cheaters pop up and try to test me, I successfully complete the quiz
The little homies talking cheese whiz
I'm the one that lit their first swisha
It's all good, pain is love man, I hurt with ya
I took the painting off the wall, man it used to be a perfect picture
I guess these niggas fret me, cause when I come around they turn and whisper
A misfit, the word that fits me?  The word enigma
Rampaging on a rant cause I'm igno-
Sologamy is my prophecy, you Kappa Beta Sigma, cliqued up, lost for words got a hiccup
God be on my side, please God I'm praying with the bishop
My issues, they surface.  I prepare to be planned.  I don't plan this shit on purpose, mercifullness to a serpent
Sunny like a pummelo, I'm sands-side, watching the waves as they come and go, they come and go
I'm not the ugly coyote, I run the road
Dip and split on hypocrites, leave no traces, no one is told
I'm gone...

[Bridge: Hodgy Beats]
But I'm forever grateful, forever and ever grateful
Nigga, I'm forever grateful
Forever grateful

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I went back to Trenton not long ago
Took the transit up to Newark and met my pops
'Til I seen him, didn't think I was strong enough
He looked at me and said "My nigga, we all we got"
All that time that we lost not spending together caught up to me that second
If love is lost between you and the love, would not recommend it
I recommend you drop those mixed feelings, you blended
Now Trenton knows his grandfather, our friendship we amended
A full circle, my crazy life.  Not about to cheat death, only enough to pay the price
A triangle, my crazy life.  I wonder cause I'm curious and shit I may be right
A nigga got questions, If I ask them they just might give me the answer in darkness, bringing me the light
I'm in a fight with the fight, I need to beat the fight
With my feet I fight, on my side---Jesus Christ

[Outro: Hodgy Beats]
I'm forever grateful
Nigga, I'm forever grateful
I'm forever grateful
Nigga nigga, I'm forever grateful
Yea yea yea
