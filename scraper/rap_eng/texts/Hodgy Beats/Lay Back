[Intro]
Roll up a L nigga, this some pimp shit
Yeah HB
Haha haha

[Verse 1]
Hop in my two door [?]
Red ruby coated candy
Told me lil homie, we gangstas
First and formost, we family
Amongst the killers and dealers
Skanks and pimps on threewheelers
The [?] skrilla
While you twist the vanilla
Women down for all the niggas
Keep emotions by the liver
Never throw on a act like you playing motion pictures
We survive by any means
They'll televise us as violent
We rather move as a unit, silent
Last resort is violence
The highest [?] is tyrant
Best in the game [?]
Shoot your lights without trying
Blood on your freshest white iron
Went out for some tye-dying without a trace is who I am
Mister run it by him, or you'll get divided

[Hook]
I'm a nigga for life
Can't slap the black off me nigga
Just stack the racks from these triggers
Extended claps for these hitters
I'm a nigga for life
That sterotype has [?]
Gone down the drain, ain't never swim in a river, my nigga
I'm a nigga for life
(Life, life, life, life, life, life)
I'm a nigga for life
(Life, let's get him)

[Verse 2]
Girl I'm a nigga for life
Lost my virgin at fifteen
Got my first felony charge the night of your sweet sixteen
I used to steal clothes at the retail stores and resell them jeans
Freshman in highschool with schemes, me and her had a thing
Holding hands with the baddest [?]
[?] passion
I'm smashing her then I'm dashing
Moms pulled up, her music blasting
Windows rolled up, then we froze up
She pulled my pants up and go nuts
Running in doughnuts
Hop the back gate and hurt my shoulder
[?] promoters
For doing us over, and over, and over, and over
Love's a drug, we hardly sober
So hard to get over
I wear my heart of my shoulders for you
Girl call me, come over

[Hook]

[Outro]
Proud of him
Life, it's life
