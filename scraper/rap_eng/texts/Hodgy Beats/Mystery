[Hook]
Dear diary, what a day it's been
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream
Woke up too late, wasn't where I should've been
For goodness sake, what's happening to me
Write lightly, yours truly, dear diary

[Verse 1]
My Wendy starting to look like Fendis
My swagger's past Benjies but I'm so friendly
"Hodgy what you on the internet looking at Bentleys?"
Sawed-off to go unlawful and the niggas wanna tempt me
The bitches work for me, she's my chef
She give me breakfast, then brush my teeth, Crest
I put all of my eggs in one basket, less with finesse
Now I'm the best, Hodgy Beats on this Johnny Quest
Put your ass to the test if you fucking make a mess
I'm tidy as I'm reciting somethin' new and excitin'
This is my recital on the roof with the rifle
Pull the trigger once, bullet sprays in the fuckin' spiral
I'm sick bitch, awfully viral, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm [?] the game
Not what you lose but what you gain, understand
Turn down the bass in my vocals and crank up the gain
I like my shit gritty, crackhouse with acid titties
Bitches on my dick like a 59.50
I don't care about a diss, muthafucka make a hit
Nigga fuckin' here, [?] watch 'em crank up the volume
I'm bolder than my Blackberry, pop white and black
Cherries after lycal, Wolf Gang swagger nigga
Fuck all people, they watching my show tonight
Tivo-ing to sequel, and they call us equal? Shit
Yeah, this that, this that Hodgy Beats BamBeeno collaboration
Yeah, swag
