[Intro: Sap]
Yeah, and I know you from where?
I don’t know you man

[Verse 1: Sap]
I’m more fly than how fast time pass
Relax out in palm beach while I palm ass
She a bad bitch over there with a wine glass
If anybody smashed I’ll be damned if I’m last
I love hitting big booty bitches
That love to watch Love and Hip-Hop
I love to run in flip flops only rolling with big shots
Car dealerships the only time I shop at big lots
And any time that I start dropping boy you don’t get hot
Hoes know my name well like they birth me
One bitch acting new and never heard me
I’m well hydrated I never was thirsty
A white bitch with a black eye never was Fergie
These niggas beating hoes down like pow
And every time I see it go down I’m like “wow”
And anyways we need a bunch of bottles right now
My ears ringing yo I mean it’s quite loud
But still

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
Hit-Boy turned a little to a lot
Throw it in the grease watch it sizzle in the pot
Dribbling the rocks send a signal to the spot
Get banged for your bucks and a missile at your top
HB run the route, still busting moves like Joe Jackson child
Sub on loud while we puffing on loud
The market dirty, need a clean up on the aisle
Copped the whole thing though, go half or nothing
She gonna go fast like Bo Jackson rushing
BC in the white Benz, pulling up thumping
And we go back like 4 flats on a bucket
Out the sunroof screaming fuck it
Out in public you gotta love it
The days when we was younger was the roughest
Now it’s nothing to hit the mall and go stupid
Plugged in the game and we still got it zoomin

[Verse 3: Mike Zombie]
I can’t say I got attention hyperactive disorder
All the water broke and the doctor diagnosed me with this
My motor mouth is premium this is grade A what I spit
But not the type to gass you up the type to push German whips
It’s only footwear on the couches when you look at my fit
And I ain’t fucking a bottle because those bitches don’t get a tip
Stumbling over like speech impediments over the fifth
Henny straighter than homophobics ain’t no soda with this
Who you know but this that rap like this
You’re two headed monsters I’m a fucking lochness
Four in the morning young ZO was still at it
They can’t get enough of these bars like Xan addicts
Momma always knew I wasn’t normal like Norman
She know my bass come hit these bitches until motels are not bits
Now every time I’m out I see them mouth
And they like “that’s Mike Zombie”
The looking at me while I’m looking at them dead in the face

[Verse 4: Hodgy Beats]
Fuck me and get a slip disc
Who is- this? Hodgy back for busi-ness
Get chips and dip like I’m frying fish sticks
I’m with a- chicken head and she dickin shit
And when I win the bread I know the bitches with this shit
She like expensive hairdos and golden bamboos
She rolled up a fat L and smoked them grams too
I get it back and take a swim like shamoo
I condition my women minus the shampoo
I’m pegging on her leggings while I hold on to her handle
I’m up before the sun up, I’m blowing out a candle
She up like what the fuck is up with records to scramble
That’s what the fuck is up with breakfast I scrambled
She woke up and discovered I left the channel
A block anglo sax and rambo attack
Lambo car jack and catch but the handles attached to me
