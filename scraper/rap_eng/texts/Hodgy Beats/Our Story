[INTRO: Hodgy Beats]
Ayo Matt!
Super Three!
Can you believe this bitch left me man?
Swear to god man, I mean like
She must be crazy or something
I'm Hodgy Beats, heh
It's all good though, like, I ain't trippin' or nothin'
I'm just gonna walk outta her house and do my thing, like

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Stepping into my spaceship
Glass broken in, you could tell where the vase hit
She took my roses
And my proposes
She didn't like the smell, though they were sprayed golden
My heart was way open
I gave token
She played the slots and left it way broken
Somebody need to fix this misfit situation
That I sit in
And I wasn't even pitchin'
I was catchin'
The hatred that miss was optimistically etchin'
I wanted her when she was fat back then
And I still want her
Even if she can't squeeze into Paris Hilton's under-
-wear, maybe you just don't care
Or Hodgy made himself available to be there
What we shared was better than an eclair
While playing I declare, war

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Girl I'm so sore
The way that she left me hit me right in the core of
My heart
I don't know where to start
This is torture like she's tearing my legs apart
From the joint
It's not my fault
So there's no need to point
I need to roll up a joint
And burn while I reminisce on who I called ointment
I swear this is some doint shit

[Outro]
