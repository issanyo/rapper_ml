My nigga Mooxe!

[Intro Hook]
Part of the process
Mistakes are a part of the process
Mistakes are part of the process
And if you want what you need
What you need is just an object
Mistakes are part of the process
(A part of the process)
Mistakes are part of the process, heard me
Mistakes are a part of the process
Mistakes are part of the process

[Verse 1]
I could've went about a lot of things a different fucking way
I should've but I didn't
It's crippling, nigga losing weight
I'm moving at an abusive pace
I'm due to race
When you pit-stopping the ones who help you, you screwed your face
You think I'm wanting to apologize well I'm not like shoes to lace
And what I do tomorrow depends on what's due today
I'm fueling the wrong energy
Misusing hate and love
And I'm moving out on the move in date
Bruising emotions brutally
Cruising and coasting crucially
Boojie boasting, doobie smoking
Cloud from fumes and rooms of haze
Coochie open, I'ma stroke it then I'ma dip out to LA
Sipping lean and counting green
And recording until the room is vacant
When you're caught, inerrant things are never mistaken
Give somebody what they want and it's never mistaken
I just pray my health is well like cartons when you shake it
And once the carton to my mind opens up, you'll have to refrigerate it

[Pre-Hook]
They tell me "oooh, you need to slow down
Slow down, slow down your pace"
They tell me "oooh, you're moving too fast
You need to slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down your pace"

[Hook]
Part of the process
Mistakes are a part of the process
Mistakes are part of the process
And if you want what you need
What you need is just an object
Mistakes are part of the process
(A part of the process)
Mistakes are part of the process, heard me
Mistakes are a part of the process
Mistakes are part of the process

[Verse 2]
No more bad trips, no more episodes
Drugs turn your mind into a vegetables
No more internet thuggish, bugging out in public
Man no more weapon songs
No more random pussy for me
I kicked the pedestal
And chilling with premature bitches I know that'll never grow
X marks the spot to the treasure box in which the treasure holds
From anonymous to Allen I
From the Golf Wang store to Babylon
I got friends in comas from overdosing
I know homeless people with more hope then
Niggas that get punched in the chest
Welcoming them demons with their arms wide open, bogus
They disappear in the gallows of shadows where the ghost is
The plagues dying from AIDS
Magic Johnson hocus pocus
Bought a new wanda for my camera
Take a shot after I focus, them double exposures
I live in a house in the woods
I'm all alone, I'm an ogre
Hiking the marrow mountains, avalanche stumbling over

[Pre-Hook]
They tell me "oooh, you need to slow down
Slow down, slow down your pace"
They tell me "oooh, you're moving too fast
You need to slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down your pace"

[Hook]
Part of the process
Mistakes are a part of the process
Mistakes are part of the process

Mistakes are part of the process
(A part of the process)
Mistakes are part of the process, heard me
Mistakes are a part of the process
Mistakes are part of the process
