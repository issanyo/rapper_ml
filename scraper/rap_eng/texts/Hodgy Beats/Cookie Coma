[Intro]
Okay, okay

[Verse]
Everybody celebrate like it's a holiday
Let me guide the way, no it isn't Father's Day
Or Mother's Day, but the other day
I had a dream I wasn't K, he slang that yay got done away
In the rectum of the hood and I ain't sprung to say
Guns don't protect them for the good, but they fuckin' spray
Afrochines such a bad cold dream
I'm dreamin' it's reality, it struggles and it battles me
They wanna fry me like they battered me
I'm a diamond they can't shatter me
Through casualty I'm actively transparent to a brand clarence
I probably would be deceased if it wasn't for my grandparents
Pop-Pop was a pastor, Grandma the pastor's wife
Slit your writs and swallow knives, bitch it's Super Six for life
I'm too legit for life, I should get a grip and die
Fuckin' take a trip and fly and never come down
I be in my own world, gold teeth and my crown
Bitch I travel 'round the world, like nigga fuck yo' town
Paper plane takin' off soon as it touch yo' ground
Who said the lost boys a never be found
You speakin' down on Odd Future, it's a fuckin' pronoun
Twenty-one in the league ho I'm a fuckin' pro now
You mainstream niggas, slow down, I turn this to a ho down
Wavin' that fo'-fo' round, empty all of those rounds
On some wild wild west shit
Death will probably be my next pick to exit
I'm sick of all these bullshit hoes, I got responsibilities
She feelin' me as I'm fe-feelin' on her tititties
To do infinity, I'm the remedy to a penalty
For once I take this shit genially, generally
I'm takin' shots like Kennedy, like fuck the enemy
Whatever enters me is meant to be, I am what I eat
Brocoli pasta, rotisserie, dark meat
Smoke weed until I feel my heart beat
Drink like a alcholic when clothes fit, from out the closet
The art belongs to whoever draws it, at heart I'm an artist
Who knows his flow is flawless
I got affection for whatever the cause is, who caused it (Let me know, let me know)

[Outro]
Yeah
(Wolf Gang!) That's just me nigga
Alchemist, what's good? (Smoke weed!)
Nigga, Wolf Gang, that's it
Everybody else, kiss my motherfuckin' ass, nigga
