[Intro]
Baby do you understand me now
But sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 1]
I know what time it is, no watch on my wrist
The only time I cockblock's when I piss
Niggas ain't about nothing, I pickpocket the lent
Got a problem with me, my fist will be locking with lips
I'm living for the now, the present I just copped a new gift
It's in a box so I ripped it up
Broke it down like when I plot it and twist
Lemons go with avacodos and chips
I hate bitches and love women, I'm not a misogynist
I hand my hitman my list and it's longer than El Chapo's clips
I rather be on the bench and watch the star players losing the game
The clock is [?], star players losing the game
They too focused watching the bench
First I stretch then I sprint
Coach put me in the game, it's two minutes left bet I win
Shoot its veins out like heroine in a syringe
First I kick it then I binge
First I kick it then I binge, nigga

[Hook]
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 2]
I had to search and find my inner dog
Man I'm signing into rap its like a twitter log
My prior period had ended bitch no menopause
I needed peace in my world like [?] dog
People who do not walk what they talk should get a dog
Death to all
Phonies leave em back there by the resevoir
They say I died I'm digging out of the dirt [?]
