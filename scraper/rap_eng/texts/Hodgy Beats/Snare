[Intro]

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Mama call me lazy, said nothing could motivate me
Her talking would aggravate me til I'm leaving the room
I roll around like a pea in a spoon
When she want me go to school
Folgers news
I'm the cool kid with a 'C' average
Only a G can see past it
Dealing with absence of fathers since past tense
Why he keep getting arrested?
Your reckless and restless
Yo,just let me live, Im a teen or adolescent
Tribulations, life lessons, I go through the grow through
Wisdom isn't given, Its percepted through living
Decisions and commitment is the broccoli and briscuits
A reliable soul, in which i desire the gold
Everyday another struggle, get your money
Fuck the hustle
When you think 'bout give up, you got one life to live up
Take this advice,and use it like protection
Everybody make mistakes
And very few correct them

[Hook: Hodgy & Chloe Clancy)]
They say, nigga,try a little harder
But it didn't work ..
I tried, it didn't work ...
So I made shit work
They told me to try a little harder
But it didn't work ..
So, I made shit work
Now my shit works
Now my shit works

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
Practice makes perfect, but nobody is
Rolling with the oddly kids
I was born a star, like Ozzy's kids
They in my biz, I probably did
I am an economist
I walk the Earth and coexist, someone you didn't know exist
I'm back like I'm here returning
You're in your seat, you're squirming
In my sermon, turbulence from all the turning
I'm just learning as I advance to my next level
Life's is a stripper, I let it dance on my gas petal
Thrash metal,so special with the hash methyl
High mellow,to do a puntos into Gods ghetto
Dirt devil, cleaning lives, demeaning wives
Leaving child's drawerless for drugs
And drawer is, the love is flawless
What's a life beyond stress, who wants it?
Its kinda like mom's gifts
Everyday another struggle
Get your money, fuck the hustle
When you think I'll give up, you got one life to live up

[Hook]

[Verse]
Where is the love at?
I said, where is the love at?
Where the love at?
Show the hatred till it gives kisses and hugs back?
I'm from traps,where niggas don't get out the game
Overrun laps, one way road to see what happens
Ankle caught in cracks
Smile gets, and never facts
Clever acts, now spit a better rap

[Hook]
