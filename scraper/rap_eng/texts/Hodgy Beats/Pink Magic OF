Hodgy Talking
(You Said You Wanna Go?) Where To?. I Mean You Can But I Don't Kno



Hook:

She Said She Wanna Go, She Said She Wanna Leave
I Said I Do To Baby Where You Wanna Be?
She Said With Me, Where Ever I Go
I'm Just What She Need Cause She Kno How I Do!
She Kno I Write Songs, But Only For Her (Her)
She Kno I Stay Down But Will It Occur (Occur)
I Don't Kno, But Baby I Kno That We Can Go!





Verse:

You Pick Me Thinkin I Was Your Best Guy
Gave You The Best Slice From My Best Pie
I Even Let You Shop At Best Buy, ITunes
Won't You Copp My Song, Leave Me Alone
I'm In My Zone
But I Got This Chick On The Other Line Of My Phone
Damn, She All On My Dome Givin Me Dome Emotions Is Shown, Unknown
Come's On The Call And You Pick Up The Phone
I Left My Phone At Home, And You Copped It
Picked It Up And You Dropped It
Then She Said Wazzup, You Said Wazzup
You Said What The!. What The Fuck!
And I Was Just Staring, Tryin Get Home
Racin In My Mclaren, Looking At Arin, Staring
People Don't Kno But They Say It Ain't Fair And I Agree!

Verse:

Yea, I Go To The House, Sit On The Couch
Pick My Shit Off The Couch, She Tried To Kick Me Out My House
Her Ring Fall Off I'm Picking Up The Spouse
Listen To Girl Shit I'm Picking Up My Mouth
Jaw Droppin, She Drop My Jaw
Now I'm Pickin Up Whats Left Up In My Pocket
Wallet, Fell Out She Sat Me On My Ass
I'm Sittin In The Grass, Smoking On The Grass
Chillin With That Ass That Was Yesterday
I Mean We Use To Play
And Now It's Time For Divorce Relationship Decay
I Can Spit That, Break Hearts Like Kitkats
Still Get Back I Meant To Say Tictacs

Verse:

Girl You Kno I Love You, I Kno You Heard The Hook
I Ain't Tryin Read But This One's For The Books
I'm Really Feeling Your Looks But Its Also The Inside
You Wanna Come With Me Because You Wanna Win Right
I'm Giving You Insight, Cause This Don't Sit In Right
Our Love Is In The Dark But Maybe The Lens Light
But This Bout To End Like ???
