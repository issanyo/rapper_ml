(speaking)
Uh! Watch your step! It's no joke out here, watch your rep!

Ain't no joke to provoke a top seed
For those who smoke and they got they own weed
Ain't no walk in the park where I'm from
Dogs that bark, but they talk with they guns
Wasn't no unlocked doors where I stayed
Too much trust in the cops, you got played
I'm that spade in the deck to cut loose
Be that blade in your neck, give respect due
You didn't expect me to get this far
Now they caught the vapors, thought they learned from Bismark
This dark track could eclipse the sunrays
Hit hard raps, we should quit the gun-play
'Cuz ain't no fun to relay the bad news
Our sons and nephews know that cash rules
For it I'll never sell the soul of Ab Rude
A poet of ever'one to tell the sad truth like

(chorus)
The Undi-Sputed, Heavyweight, Rudest
Pa-rum-pa-pom! No jargon, could ever dead, this yard mon! (Yard mon!)
Inside, outside, all sides
Seal the perimeter! I'm a lion of the pride
His tribe, my tribe, your tribe
I put it into ya! Warlords of the Flies

Only 9-1-1's a joke here
Cops don't come till machine gun smoke clears
Show no fear in your heart to get tested
Go nowhere in the dark unprotected
As if I gotta remind you how hectic it is
We all have homies that set-trip
They'll call for medics when the gats unleashed
You'll regret it if you don't make it back in one piece
That's how they do it no resolving the beef
Why Battle Axe Crew stays armed to the teeth
Comin' at you with them tattood physiques
So if you rap weak, better take a back seat
This is a beat that's haunting in sleep
It could bump in your jeep, what they want from the street
You could never be measured as this rude
Meet me up at the session to get schooled by

The Undi-Sputed, Heavyweight, Rudest
Pa-rum-pa-pom! No jargon, could ever dead, this yard mon! (Yard mon!)
Inside, outside, all sides
Seal the perimeter! I'm a lion of the pride
His tribe, my tribe, your tribe
I put it into ya! Warlords of the Flies
