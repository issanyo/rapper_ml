Wake the town and tell the people
About the musical disc coming your way

[Aceyalone-Talking]
Yeah! One-two..one-two
Where you at? Where you going to?
Is you going do about it? Is you going be about it?
Project Blowed! Abstract, Fat Jack, Ace-One
Ladies and gentleman, good people
Yeah, good brothers and sisters on deck
Yeah, check me out

[Verse One: Aceyalone]
Dig this, peep the twist
Hand over fist, hand stand on a cliff
Land stiff expand on the gift
Uplift the masses and pass, me the splif
It's love thang, it's a hate thang[Love], it's a great thang [And hate]
Cali to the state of Maine, it's a world thang
And I'mma soldier, always a war going on it's never over [We are at war!]
I make music
For the people
That try to live a Good Life and keep it peaceful
And be resourceful and keep achieving
Every season we represent the reason
I'm from the Fellowship
I'm from the Project
I tell them all access is the object
It's so beautiful, it's so painful
I do the work and don't forget what I came for

[Hook: Abstract Rude]{Aceyalone}
The saga, continues {Yeah!}
On the road again, the different venues {One-two!}
Who blessed you, was kept true {One-two!}
Finessed you, because we got that soul {Where you at?}
The lonely, the only, {Where you going to?}
MC's of the Project Blowed {What chu going do about?}
{Is you going be about it?} MC's of the Project Blowed...{Project Blow!}

[Verse Two: Abstract Rude]
I'm Scorpion and don't speak with forked tongue
I'm your son of light force endorphin's
From the diaphragm abdomen Rude
With Ace the voice box, top choice rockers

[Aceyalone]
Aceyalone's my name and Abstract is here

[Aceyalone and Abstract Rude]
He's Fat Jack it's like that and that's the way it is

[Abstract Rude]
From old school[Old school] to new school [New school]
Gotta give you that, soul you're used to
Cause I ain't new to the block don't cop an attitude
You can't have everyone glad, some gon' be mad at you
The gossip is heard the Mercury is arising
A profit is earned ghetto enterprising
A moment of truth is hidden in silence
A culprit is crew and nobody is smiling
My rubber is going burn more mileage on the road
That's when you going learn more knowledge on the whole

[Hook]


[Verse Three: Aceyalone]
Like I was once told something by a wise dude
Keep your eyes on the price I advise you
So when you slide through you gotta mean it
So here's something you could ride to the scene in
Independent, rap label
Round table, square business
I got a passport and a Visa
An American dream I want a piece of
I'm a MC, I'm a poet
I do spoken word, I like smoking herb
In all of the day, and all in the night, we all in the fight
So don't be tripping on me

[Hook]

[Verse Four: Abstract Rude]
Everything in me is a heredity plus
The new and improved, the smooth and rough
The rude and nice, don't ruin your life
With a hooligan type
Checking my Yin and Yang, ooh
I'm feeling your pain child
My soul sings the songs of James Brown
No jiggabo, minstrel show rather classic and a inventive flow
That'll enlighten, wake up to take note
It's inviting, have faith and keep hope
Let each quote bless you, finesse you
It's kept true, music is my sweet nephew

[Hook]
