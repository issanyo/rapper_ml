Staring at the truth can be like staring at the sunlight. You get blinded

[Abstract Rude:]
Feel an eclipse
That energy shifts
The wind is so brisk
It'll push a man over the cliff

Beginning with this
The word that was born with the fist
Absorbing the lands and
Flesh torn with the death wish

We ain't gotta get violent to communicate
We ain't gotta see eye to eye to mobilize and motivate

Death before dishonor
Envy or betrayal
Never gon' be stronger than we were
The day that we were all together
Spike the nail in the coffin
'cuz they say you better off and
On the other side when you ain't got no problems

I ain't sayin' heavens gate is callin'
It don't take death to dodge 'em
'Cuz you're alive
You may as well think of a better option

Let's get you rounded with a spiritual base
So you can look in the mirror and be proud of your face
A real image don't know how to be fake
Make it by any means or behind the scenes view of the outtakes

I lived in a time of raising hell
I lived in a time of LL
At Def Jam
I lived in a time
Of champions of rhyme
Like Myka motha' fuckin' 9
And X Clan
I lived in a time of Kool Moe
I lived in a time of Native Tongues
And Hiero
And who could forget the Wu though
And who rep the west?
My crew Project Blowed

A thousand nations
Even our own
Descend upon us

No man is prophet
Not a single break
Or chink in armor

Our wounded and dead
Got fox and vultures feedin' on 'em
Our movement is lead
Protect the culture
Keep it goin'

En garde
For every push
When they come hard
It's shields up
From the arrow barrage
That builds up
From one bar to the next
For every bar you take a text
I got another thought to digest

I Rock Dis Funky Joint
'cuz Funky Town's the livest
And you missin' the point
You digress I guess

But I got something going
With my little KTF
My crew
Is right on the brink
Of being The Dark Knight Rises

A terror in the air
A bearer of bad news
Your era is in jeopardy
So be scared of Ab Rude

Can't get me out your head
My nightmare has you
But you'll never be aware
'cuz to you only cash rules

I lived in a time of raising hell
I lived in a time of LL
At Def Jam
I lived in a time
Of champions of rhyme
Like Myka motha' fuckin' 9
And X Clan
I lived in a time of Kool Moe
I lived in a time of Native Tongues
And Hiero
And who could forget the Wu though
And who rep the west?
