[Verse 1]

All we gotta do is
Record the song and tweak the mix
Compile the album, go down the list
Some hit, some miss, that risk you take
One hit you rich, that dream you make
Your cash advance from master dat
If you have the chance, don't slack on wax
Get radio spins, from shakin' they hands
When you grease their palms, they made you spin
It's so not told, go platinum, gold
Pay back what's owed, whether fast or slow
Be black and bold, just have some soul
Many lack the flow, only half of whole

[Hook]

[Various samples]
I thought I oughta tell you, better yet warn
People not open never caught a sleep?
Yep

[Verse 2]

Hip hop
Hip hop if it were not for you I'd probably
Walk the street, carry Glocks and heat
Be on some ill shit that you would not believe
Maybe a cat thief giving you grief, family beef
Instead I use the inner eye energy and chi
It all seems simplified for you and me
Though we hard core unorthodox mass ministry
Some of my folks is locs, all my dogs get hype
You fo' sho' got jokes, all talk with a mic
You lost your stripes, ghetto pass revoked
Don't let cash get low, can't go back no mo'
In the game there's pain, small fries big names
Some die in vain, it's a cryin' shame

[Hook]
Follow instructions, don't lose the context

All we gotta do is
Collect awards, show respect on tour
Don't neglect the floor, to the top we soar
Dear god it bumps, if you got the humps
Speakers in your trunk, and you blazin' skunk
And you diggin' the vibe, with me and Tribe Unique
Up to the highest peak, public outreach
See what works for you may not work for me
I give them the same feeling of our first LP
You on work release, I move merchandise
Yeah you took that heat, was it worth the price?
Many hurt themselves, helps their record sales
End up next in jail, makin' threats and bail
Be a musical person, you're confusin' your searchin'
You know danger is lurkin', you'll be hurtin' for certain
Many chase the lights, but they game ain't tight
Could have sunk the shot, but they aim wasn't right

[Hook]
