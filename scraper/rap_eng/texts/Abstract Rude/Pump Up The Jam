[Intro: Abstract Rude]
Pump up the jam {x12}

[Verse One: Abstract Rude]
It's a gig they want us to come and do what we did last time
Resin came with it plus Rude had rhymes
Untouchable, y'all be loving the sto'
Back in the day we would've been doing the Ed Sullivan Show
Joking with Johnny Carson and Arsenio
But today we gotta settle for Jay Leno
And I know with this big bam mama jamma
They would've had us playing at the Copa Cabana
Cause we be wrecking for y'all
Like headliners at the festival hall, the Resin Dawg
With the afro
Dizzy yack and we getting back to more of that feel good music
Makes you wanna holler
Get up and dance to it
Nod your head to the beat ha
Abstract the dread is gonna reach ya
While I'm travelling these kilometers, do it

[Hook]
Pump up the jam {x3}
Come on everybody
And pump up the jam
Pump up the jam
Pump up the jam
To the rhythm and pump up the jam
Pump, pump
To the rhythm and pump up the jam
Pump up the jam
Everybody pump up the jam
Pump up the jam
Pump up the jam

[Verse Two: Abstract Rude]
With a little of the big day out
We do it live and you don't know what you talking about
Heads high when we riding by on all coasts
East to west, all peace we toast to cascade
Back in the day we would've done Woodstock
Then American Bandstand with Dick Clark
As if to say we would've had the crowd rocked
Mix some of that big band with hip hop
Cause we be wrecking for y'all
The headliner when we step to the stage, the Resin Dawgs
Abstract Rude gets you back in the mood
They in a groove
When we hit 'em with that feel good music
Makes you wanna holler
Get up and dance to it
Nod your head to the beat ha
Peep through your town to meet and greet ya
And don't worry the tour is gonna reach ya, do it

[Hook]
