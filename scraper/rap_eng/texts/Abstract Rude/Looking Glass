[Intro: MC 900 ft Jesus sample]
Stare and stare, I look across the isles, at the process he wears
Once he was superbad, didn't mind nappy hair

[Verse 1: Abstract Rude]
Can I look through your looking glass
And get a glimpse at what you're seeing
Can I be in you for a day
Play with your insides and your emotions
Must promotion bring a solution
Into your confusion without amusing
My power, you devour
I keep a hawk-eye on the watchtower
What makes your dick grow, what makes your tick sis
I knew an old tick went by the name of Genesis
He be gone now, without a fair trial
He has a new journey called infinity
There is an entity, that is the friend to be
There is an entity, who is my enemy
I wanna side you, I promise I'll be quick
To be the mediator of your inner complex
I be asleep, you have a lot of goals
As for sweaty palms and ever-growing nose

[Refrain]
Now I know that I am not perfection
But I and I agree that you need help, so get it
Fast in your looking glass
If you can last an abstract swang
Now metal man, and me-oh-me-oh-my
You can fly like a birdy in the looking glass and work it

You know, they say that
The eyes, are the gateway to the soul
So be sure to keep your eyes open

[Verse 2]
Can I go inside your looking glass
And get a fill for, what you fillin'
I know we make mistakes, but you're ridiculous
I am a wittiness, to your pathetic ways
They never happy means, for f-fruity means
That makes for moody means, you know what fat means
How come you're backwards, you a watermel
You hadn't gone a trail that's leading straight to hell
That means you have a soul, that means you're hellbound
You supposed to be a man, you just look down
I got fire for your desire
You has fire, if you're a liar
That's how it is, that's how it's thought to be
No generosity, but ill as sodomy

[Refrain]
Now I'm not God and I don't claim to be
But as you see your way of life is foul

So it's very imperative that you don't understand the concept
Hey man, bring back that looking glass
