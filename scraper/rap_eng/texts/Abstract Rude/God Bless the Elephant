The Grouch:
God bless the elephant my family ties
Engulfed in my element insanity dies
Bless the vanity wise, men rise
Devil been damnin' me but I seen lies in verses
Churches beam _ in reflections of my 3 eyes
Slippin' in the darkness chart this _ high
Cause everywhere I'm marchin' the smartists are goin' _
The _ a pick fools dry
Maybe I'm a less a victim the harder I try
Don't barter and battle with demons let's fly
Save your soul see men and _ in for life
Drop that musket, fuck it, break that fear
Let your inner light shine
Make that clear consciousness reappear, which way to steer
We ain't taught to be still can't botch your free will
Just watch us rebuild like populations we killed
Patience has been drilled
My skin feel funny when I lost myself
New money ain't the source of wealth
True dummies sell that tale
Ooo, mummies I can smell the smell
I don't wanna kill myself to live
Me I'd rather will myself to give strength to myself and them (thanks) all
Be a helping hand and a hell of a friend
By the way of my words and the ink of my pen
I stand corrected by my faults and the lessons I've learned
The people I love and the bridges I've burned
It's vivid once livid I give it my heart again, strong warrior
Artisan carvin' in music to marvel in, they starvin' again
So hardened left in the margin to sin
And be praised for it, become slaves to it
_ grave unit and I behave human
Evil loomin, lookin like its doin somethin
Earth human, good's truant
They goin dumb and stupid
Numb and ruthless still bullet proof less
Truth is, it mustn't much matter
Most are gonna steal, cheat and kill to get fatter
Blood splatters and scrub chatter and love laughter
After disaster let's make masters of us
I ask if you trust in your heart
Plus do your part to be just
Sharply up for whatever arises
Cause God will forever provide us

Abstract Rude:
Demonic devices, consciousness risin'
True it was so much easier not to care
Glad I got good people in my square who still care
Come on

The Grouch:
After disaster comes self mastery
Good people sing and dance with me
Look alive be alive we alive lets ride at last be free
You don't gotta act like you dont feel
All y'all know bein' cool ain't real
Cut the bullshit and act like you ain't actin
No need for bein' guarded in here
Fat Jack helped me to make it slap
You better believed that I've learned from that
My turn it to give it up
On delivery of this you might turn a leaf
And return them peace, and love and light
Keep bumpin' it right we dumpin' it like
There's a message in the music, and it's addressed to you

Abstract Rude:
True it's so much, so much
Glad I got good people in my square, who still care
You won't find that
True it's so much easier not to care
Glad I got good people in my square, who still care
Yeah Grouch good people
And you won't find that
Glad I got good people in my square, who still care
And you won't find that everywhere
No you won't find them everywhere
Ones who still care
