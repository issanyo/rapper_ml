I got up this morning to go, go, go
The ground is still wet from the storm
On the surface, it's the same old thing
From my perspective it's change, change, change

I think I just cracked the code
Was rotten, I broke the mold
Higher than ever but, no
Try to see how high I go

Some gon' hate to see you smile
They live to see you down
They talk while we take off
Wheels up, oh, wheels up

That heart that's breaking down
Then love's gon' come back round
Don't let it kick you down
Wheels up, oh, wheels up

Everything looks better up top and above
And decorate it but I hate it enough
I'm wearing these shades when they see me up close
But I'm a fan of my face they love 'em most

I built a house on the clouds
Lookin', lookin' down these halls
I can see the city now
I know where I wanna go

Some gon' hate to see you smile
They live to see you down
They talk while we take off
Wheels up, oh, wheels up

That heart that's breaking down
Then love's gon' come back round
Don't let it kick you down
Wheels up, oh, wheels up

Wheels up, oh, wheels up
Wheels up
Wheels up, oh, wheels up

Don't you let nobody break you down
Be a force for life wherever you go
It's so rock n' roll, so play it with your soul
Keep it moving, never let grass under your feet grow

Some gon' hate to see you smile
They live to see you down
They talk while we take off
Wheels up, oh, wheels up

That heart that's breaking down
Then love's gon' come back round
Don't let it kick you down
Wheels up, oh, wheels up

Some gon' hate to see you smile
They live to see you down
They talk while we take off
Wheels up, oh, wheels up

That heart that's breaking down
Then love's gonna come back round
Don't let it kick you down
Wheels up, oh, wheels up

Nothing keep you down
Oh yeah

I'm takin' off, oh, baby
I am up on the run
I'm takin' off, oh, baby
Closer to the sun
