[Intro/Hook - x2]
From the high degrees to the low degrees
Ice cold, red hot, you can burn the freeze

Fahrenheit, very low
Icicle, hail storm, below zero
Temperature, closed doors, wet conditions are unhealthiest
Weather war, about minus four Celsius
Sky's presence, absence of solar there
Snow's essence, existence of polar bears
Only strong survive in this habitat
Forever off and on, life is a thermostat
Will you melt? Apply with the belt tractor
Still you felt my style's wind chill factor
In a pack of rappers, actual, natural disaster
Raps that go faster than wind speed
Tracks by the masters indeed
The season for freezin and green need
Dog sled stampede by the freezed slave calvary
I relieve those updated, cowardly fools never made it, through the art

[Hook - x2]

Fire logs, oven on
Hot metal, hot wax, brimstone
In a hell hole, sell your soul for the go
Burn rubber, burn blunts, burn coals
For the smell-good, tales from the hood well understood, so
Hot I shook the spot to pop a squad on this block
Pressure cooker pot, to know the time look at her watch
For the boiling point, evaporation and your life stops
You bring the heat they can't believe that (They can't believe that)
They gathered together the flare up, tear up and bring the heat back
Like modern day Nat Turner's with black burners
Everybody gotta heater and we'll burn ya
Just like Kilbey's for loin cloth
Cocktail tusk, not a roof is lit
Hell we don't need no water, burn down the shit
Seems ain't nobody quiet in a riot
My amp is HOT, high voltage in my WATTS
Blowin up the spot, blow up your radio box
See me with the bingin, steamin like an engine
Can't take the heat get out of the kitchen quick bitch

[Hook - x2]

High degrees to the low degrees
Ice cold, red hot, you can burn the freeze
(From the) High degrees to the low degrees
Ice cold, red hot, you can burn the freeze

I burn blunts with my Gz............
