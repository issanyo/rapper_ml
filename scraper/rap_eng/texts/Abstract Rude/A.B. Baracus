[Intro: Abstract Rude sounding like B.A. Baracus]
What fool? Shut up fool

[Hook: Aceyalone (Abstract Rude)]
A.B. Baracus
(I pity the fool who don't bump this)
I pity the fool!
(How many of yout are gonna want this?)
We off the ringer
(It's in the air it smells so pungent)
We got the booya
(Huddle up in a van to come smoke with)
The A-Team!
(I pity the fool who don't bump this)
I pity the fool!
(If you're feeling my crew then pump yo' fist)
Pump your fist up!
(I'm Abstract with my accomplice)
Ace One!
(Huddle up in a van and come roll with)
The A-Team!

[Verse One: Abstract Rude]
A certified family affair of fooling around freely
Phase two of the alpha style freed and Free Willy
We're G's really
God/Gangsta/Griot we are
Covert on a co-op from a Mohawk to dreadlocks
Your simpleton threats have no effects on me and Templeton Peck
We blow you back before we finish the set
I ain't scared I ain't scared
Just because you run your mouth
We ain't running off just because your guns is out
(What fool!)
When in doubt I don't punk out
I bug out like Murdock
And it don't take Sherlock
Elementary dear Watson
It's not rocket science, mic rocking
Every land we go, I ain't getting on crop dusting plane Hannibal
Rap commando
Hand in hand, no "I" in "team"
These other rappers tell you lies, sell you dreams

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Aceyalone]
A.B. Baracus
He's cooler than a cactus
Don't even have to practice and he still got special tactics
They try to track us down and jack us but the fact is
We mack this so well
It's attractive, magnetic
Miraculous, kinetic
Energetic
Poetic
Always ready to set it and don't you ever forget it
Shit yeah
The proof is in the pudding
But just don't be putting yo' fingers all in pudding when you know you shouldn't
Tapioca
This is poker with no jokers
Don't make my folk us, have to put you in a choker
I got the nerve gas
And I'ma serve that ass
When I swerve past I'll give you the bird bath
I can't be dealt with when I'm on this felt tip
I've walk the world and make sure that it's felt...shit
My sensory perceptions...ha
I like to walk the sky, look 'em in the eye, give it my best try
Uh

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Abstract Rude]
[?]
Of all these little wannabe Abbies
Better call all cars when the balls in our court we don't down the fort

[Aceyalone]
No sir
I fathered that there youngin
I daddy'd that child style and brung in that's so heavily among 'em

[Abstract Rude]
[?] the captain
Kirk of work and Spock of logic
Dr. McCoy for B-boys who gotta get a fix
I'm Scottie on the controls
Beam you up, not through the nose
Always want to fuck Uhura
We'll fade anyone in Turok

[Aceyalone]
We overload
At the Project Blowed establishment
And when it's overthrown in the back field, I'm grabbing it
We got the oatmeal sticking to ya bone flow
Behind the smoke shield is Aceyalone yo

[Abstract Rude]
Style, through, 2000 and beyond
It takes so long to amount to be more than a pond
In the game of king and queen
Many in between
If you're shamed you must redeem
Hire the team

[Aceyalone]
A-Team
Errr errr
Super supreme
Tight at the seams always letting off some steam
A.B. Baracus
One of the cats I run with
We keep it moving until it's all said and done with

[Hook]
