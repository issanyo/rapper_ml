[Intro: Abstract Rude, ?]
Damn, it's dark down here, damn
Y, Y, N-Vee
And after the rain came sunshine
Yes, yes - nickname, nickname: Y, Y, N-Vee
Y, Y, N-Vee
Super madness, just cheese

[Part 1: ?, ?]
Why must you envy
Making a lot of enemies
Look at me what do you see?
[?] they come, bitch
[???] switch
[?] by the milli-second
She don't even need a mic
Give me one, I still ain't check it
Knowing Niggers loves this
Want to know the substance
Y to the e to the n, a, n
Things about to crush this
Oh yeah
[?]
Better go, let it go
On the mic I am poetical
My style [?] your style pathetical
Take a deep breath and clear your thoughts
And inhale the words until it's spoken
Before we start [?] bitches ain't choking
Run and tell a friend that the women gotta broke it
Oh yeah, broke in hell
Riotous, ain't this nothing but trouble
Bitch don't slip like you walking in a bottle
Oops, we got to bust your rubble
Should I have a crew that was deeper in cobble
Now you [?] shit
Shit, shit

[Hook: Abstract Rude, ?]
It's all about that Y N-Vee
Don't nobody should have heard fact I'm a gee
Niggers better know if I go hit the streets
Always struggle - Y N is a bad bitch
[?]

[Part 2: ?, ?]
It's all about that super Cali
Not too fragile - Why can't keep on listenings
Especially the dope shit - link and you won't miss it
Just to let you know, we are into that too
Four booty queens coming at you
Blowing up the mainframe
Y N-Vee is not coming with the same swag
Bitches cry up in their summer afraid they can not see us, girl
We can take it to the middle of the states with the mickiest, damn
And if you want more, we can take it to the middle of the dance floor, whore
We are firing gees - Y N-Vee got you in the trance
Hot ass Hip Hop - DJ drops in and you dance
Y N-Vee
Super mad because this shit
Tells you I was the jingler [?] feeling that wigger that kept your deal
And when we attack your field
Row down because we wrote that [?]
Your begging about to get blowed on
But you gained in the backseat
Your mama was hoping you don't mess with a bitch
[?] as I get as a lesbi
And if the bitch Diane with Y N-Vee let it be known that she was our chick, Nigga
Shit, Shit

[Hook: ?, ?]
It's all about that Y N-Vee
Don't nobody should have heard fact I'm a gee
Niggers better know if I go hit the streets
Always struggle - Y N is a bad bitch
