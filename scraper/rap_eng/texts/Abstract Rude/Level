[Verse 1]
Do you want my level?
Yeah, my level
I'm a sucker for your body type
The fire temper matches your mind
Never been one to settle
Settle, wee-ooh
Just show me something profound now
Who wouldn't wanna hold you down?

[Chorus]
I'll never let you go
I found someone
Someone on my level
Level (my level)
A volume in stereo
I found someone
Someone on my level
Level
My level (level)
Level, level, level
My
Level, level, level

[Verse 2]
You're never judgemental, judgemental
You build me up and never tear me down
Put you first and never in the background
Lovin' you is simple (simple)
So simple (so simple)
You my shady spot on sunny days
You're summer to my ocean waves
Been waitin' all my life, waitin' all my life
For you to come along, put harmony to my song
Distracting in the hype, lacking in the hype
Now everything's aligned, we eye to eye

[Chorus]
I'll never let you go
I found someone
Someone on my level
Level (my level)
A volume in stereo
I found someone
Someone on my level
Level
My level (level)
Level, level, level
My
Level, level, level

[Bridge]
I know we don't know everything
About each other
But the rest along the way
I can't wait to discover

[Chorus]
I'll never let you go
I found someone
Someone on my level
Level (my level)
A volume in stereo
I found someone
Someone on my level
Level
My level (level)
Level, level, level
My
Level, level, level
My
Level, level, level
My
Level, level, level
My

[Outro]
You on my, yeah
You on my, yeah
You on my, level
You on my, level
You on my, level
Level
