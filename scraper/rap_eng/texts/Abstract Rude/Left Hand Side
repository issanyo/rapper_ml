[Intro:Abstract Rude]
Straight from the Mood Pieces by ATU
To all my brother and sisters out there
City to City
State to State
Country to Country

Having a universal cypher, yanamsayin
And you all welcome
(you all invited)

[Verse 1: Abstract Rude]
You all invited to the united headquarters
Where people in LA stop through bringing the chaos to order
We're searching for the clues in this scavenger hunt
Go by the rules, after what you want
(We want your mind)
And what we do to pass the time
Is read, study, build, steady sharpening the skill
We are the men of steel
Of real intuition and know how
Any tempo, any style
Tracks by X-factor to contemplate the next chapter
Etched in stone, rare rhythms I condone
(Who is the strongest of them all?!)
Someone who tell himself that he won't fall
We got brothers in the back slappin' bones on the glass table
And others, watching the rap videos on cable
Producers in studios is how it goes
Dancers outside sparrin
We getting far in the way
Heavily weighted LA, Underground

(you're all invited to the united headquarters)

[Hook x2]
Where we at? Come again!?
Hip-hop, it's easy!

[Verse 2]
Hip-hop, on the We-e-e-est Coast
Got ingenuity and really be doing the most
Run off at your mouth if you will, about your city
But you really that regular run of the mill and talking shitty
Say the old statements don't hold water
Water won't stay wet
I only knew Super Nat to be an underwater vet
But ni**as borrow like there's no tomorrow
I'm bout to pull my thoughts back  and release them like a bow and arrow
My eye is on the sparrow
And I know emcees are watching me, but still haven't gotten to me
I got a monopoly, so they ain't got no property
All of this murderism/commercialism is a mockery of the god
What you call keeping it real, I call facade
But i's aight kid, you all invited...to the left...hand..side
Of the tracks with facts

(you're all invited to the united headquarters)

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
The listeners were affected, as soon as they selected
What I suggested, based on the profit of my investments
Now, you connected with the mood piece we produce
At the spot where we kick it, it's a super gang truce
We hang loose and hold tight
Afterlife's put in all nighters and the vibe be so right
We call it the b-boy kingdom, for b-girls and b-boys
And how many want to see them?
(none of them)
'Cause we come to make noise!
(Are you excited!?)

(you're all invited to the united headquarters)
