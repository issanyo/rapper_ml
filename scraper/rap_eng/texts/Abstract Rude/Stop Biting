[Verse 1]
I catch little sleep at night, wake up the next and keep it moving
Context, don't take me out, this raw fusion
Is climaxed, high friction on vestax
And techniques, making my money with less tax
And prestige, as long as I'm cracking my kraft cheese
Calling the cops and I have to leave
I'm either very smart, or incredibly stupid
Ahead of my time, I'm locked in a room with a view of the walls
Iron clap, my rhyme is a firing squad
Watching them fall and grabbing my bowling balls
Holding them all acountable with the mountain of evidence
You're under the table dead presidents
Wouldn't let you walk from the case with a hung jury
A lifetime ban from the mic if you come near me
The upright in odacity and gull
If you feel certain, you'll never get past the steel curtain

[Chorus]
Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
Or we'll be like fighting.... Mike Tyson
Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
You ain't saying nothing, I keep head butting... Mike Tyson
"My style is impeduous
My defense is impregnible
I'ma eat your style, eat your style kid"
Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
Clash of the titans... Mike Tyson

[Verse 2]
Arjures, shoot off arrows like we're gladiator
Even if we get past the piles of knights with armor satire
Hate or die, haters don't you even try
Retreat from your sneak attack leave from us or you won't be back
Or the bishop will chop, will covert diagonals
In a hail of ammo, we'll give you your halo
Stay low in a bunker, resort with the thunder
Or we'll be hotile like german sheppard
And the viking manuever, we're taking Vancouver
To new heights with the viking like, no other producer
With a spiked ball and chain I'm Braveheart, Maximus
With an axe in his hand, slicing up these abstract Pakistans
Never stop, let you not be want again
Me and the Wolverine are the two of the hardest X-Men
Eighteen on the abaracus, hey to you in a happy room
No one comes to the accalade where all the Massmen are made
Clash of the titans in a street for fighting
We meet with the mic and my reach I'm deadly at best
Fuck Elliot Ness I'm a style Al Capone my styles my own
Stop biting... Mike Tyson

[Chorus]
Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
Or we'll be like fighting.... Mike Tyson
Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
You ain't saying nothing, I keep head butting... Mike Tyson
"My style is impeduous
My defence is impregnible
Ima eat your style, eat your style kid"
Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
Clash of the titans... Mike Tyson

[Verse 3]
Know how to pause you to switch your game plan
While you hearing this you change styles
Can't even tell we're listning to the same man
That we heard when we came out, shang-how
You keep biting off this rhyme writing
Style taking them without liscense, now crowd hypen
I'm navy seal on you foot soldiers
It's kill at will till that shit's over
I'm conceptuable, they just over, incomplete if it's lackluster
They bite like a frustrated boxer
I'm coming down like a paratrooper, hard on ya
If you're not I'm moving and shaking, no creature in you bakers
Bled out, too fragile for Shaq and the Lakers
Abstract's the major, minor, eighty-eight keys solo
With frequency, modulation and foot pedals
All out battle till beef settles
It's inticing, scorpion is in rising
All dead wait get shedded, we're downsizing
Independant, definately enterprising
We get offended when you're blating with the senseless biting

[Chorus]
Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
Or we'll be like fighting.... Mike Tyson
Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
You ain't saying nothing, I keep head butting... Mike Tyson
"Everybody always talk about Mike Tyson is biting Holyfield
He bit somebody too man, you know what I'm saying"
Stop biting while I'm rhyme writing
Clash of the titans, Ab and Rob the Viking

[Mad Child]
Stop biting, no doubt
Yo Ab, I'm glad you're getting this off your chest
Cause you and Freestyle Fellowship, Project Blowed
You guys are true originators of styles
And it's a compliment when these kids get inspired by what you did
And continue to do. But it's an insult when they get all gassed up
And forget where they got these styles from in the first place
You know? Battle Axe

[Abstract Rude]
That's right
