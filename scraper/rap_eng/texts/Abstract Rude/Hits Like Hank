And all my homies real smart,  think tank, think tank
I'm 'bout to knock it out the part like Hank
Hearing it's 'bout the heart, raised in the streets
Out of the dark and gettin' faded with my peeps
I rolled three a day, hope I get it to one a month
[?], you won't even want to blunt
And yo, I ain't gonna front, my nigga dutch [?]
He be like "smoke some nigga, and I'll smoke some too!"
Females can't front [?], as long as one got a car they can be where we are
Jaguars, Lexus, Benzos, and [?]
[?], bend over, daddy
Safe sex shall have no regrets, the [?] 'll let her twice and you know the rest, it's from the west!

And all my homies real smart think tank
We got hits out the park like Hank
And all my niggas whole day smoke dank
To all my queens top rank give thanks
And all my homies real smart think tank
We got hits out the part like Hank

You riders are wild, as many cruise inside us, the collective is mass, we ain't wreckin' yo ass, we livin' fast after class, and we knowin' the math, and tryna add to the stash, gettin' bags of cash, dropping off packages, picking up cabbages, our whole rolodex full of numbers and address, my gat's in the mail, my wax is for sale at yo local record store, this is what you paid for, when I came through the door, the whole party followed me, my black Romeos, fat jacks [?], blowin' up sets, signifying the west, taking enough money with us when we buying the best, L.A. to G.A., P.A. to N.Y., mass men keep it true, OG do or die

And all my homies real smart think tank
We got hits out the park like Hank
And all my niggas whole day smoke dank
To all my queens top rank give thanks

You can call me abby, abstract, or ab rude
Just coolin' in the ghetto with tune and I smooth
Mass men nigga got nothing to prove
The way we do this groove will make the units move
I didn't spend my whole budget on a car (no doubt)
We bought a home studio so we could work at the house
Projects, products, I gets our bucks and checks and money orders
They check our bags, say we look funny at the border
That makes me mad, so I flip 'em off like a quarter
No possession of cells, I ain't goin' to jail [?]
In cities, states, and countries [?]
I roll with the crew, give dap when we part
One time won't find jack 'cause we smart
ATU stay true from these parts
Mind, body, soul, trifecta, three parts

And all my homies real smart think tank
We got hits out the park like Hank
And all my niggas whole day smoke dank
To all my queens top rank give thanks
And all my homies real smart think tank
We got hits out the part like Hank
