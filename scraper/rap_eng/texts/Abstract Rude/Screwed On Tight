"Hey we gonna do it like this"

Concentration, use your brain
Keep the rhythm or you'll be off the game
Cause anything can happen on any given night
So you gotta have your head screwed on tight

And we're gonna move like this, I don't like losing shit
But if it's serious, we'll school it, I ain't materialistic
I'm a calculate my odds and attach rate the market
I have to stay involved and keep the faith in god
Every crime in the street, they don't call the cops for them all
It's up to the homies left there to handle it and solve
You sipping alcohol and now you want to brawl
And fighting at the bar, somebody's gonna draw
And they'll wonder what's the cause, you didn't even pause
It was all over a broad, people just started falling
Everybody was mobbing, none of them using caution
Then they heard the shots and boy does this happen often

Concentration, use your brain
Keep the rhythm or you'll be off the game
Cause anything can happen on any given night
So you gotta have your head screwed on tight
Concentration, use your brain
Keep the rhythm or you'll be off the game
Cause anything can happen on any given night
So you gotta have your head screwed on tight

I don't roll like that, sometimes I'm holding back
Because more times than not you'll be running your trap
And if I tripped off you running it, I'd probably stick a gun in it
Don't be out here acting like no son of a bitch
You fit the stereotype
All your homies jump in, you've never had a fair fight
You better hope he's never deep up here
If you leave him alive, he'll be back next year
You think you're hard cause you travel in packs
Do you run up on somebody that is packing a gat
You never knew someone could beat your case
And if they do, I hope I see the look on your face
Because Karma Darkma are their names
Keep them down or son, you'll be off the game
Subject is, just check this
Between your earrings, above your necklace

Concentration, use your brain
Keep the rhythm or you'll be off the game
Cause anything can happen on any given night
So you gotta have your head screwed on tight
Concentration, use your brain
Keep the rhythm or you'll be off the game
Cause anything can happen on any given night
So you gotta have your head screwed on tight
