You know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true we
Keep it true
You know we keep it true - we got to keep it true we got to keep
It true
We got to keep it true - you know what we do you know what
We do
We got to keep it true
Relax your mind w/the music - you know what we do you know what we do
Sit back and vibe w/this true shit

This isn't really what you think it is
That is if you're even thinkin' in the first place
The first place isn't always the winner
And winnin' isn't everything
And this is not a race
I am not a android I am not a mongoloid
I am not annoyed by the void in your brain
This is not a trick son you are not a victim
You are just a man b-boyed out the game
Let me explain
Abstract are you fresh?
Ain't nobody fresher
But it's hard to get around w/out some clown tryin' to test ya
Acey are you dope? Dopest in the world
I give it to the moms and pops I give it to the boys and girls
Oh so you a family man? Aren't we all aren't we all
Yes we are, Trying to make jams man and expand my repertoire

We got to keep it true we got to keep it true - relax your mind w/the music
You know what we do you know what we do - sit back and vibe w/this true shit

Well I be arrangin' thoughts in my brain cell family
[?rapidly?] embarking on incredible creative routes
Understanding me is truth shining like a lie
When I say break wide I mean take trips not just in your ride
In your mind
Cause when you left you're right on time
The sun'll come out tomorrow and it'll set in the west
So I don't sweat the rest
Who wanna inhale stress
Keep it true

You know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true we
Keep it true
You know we keep it true - you know what we do you know what we
Do
We got to keep it true - the W the W the W
We got to keep it true
Relax your mind w/the music - and keep it true and keep it true
Sit back and vibe w/this true shit

The world is full of bullshitters
Liars and triers and quitters
Could-a-beens wanna be's thought-i-was isn't-i-is's
And everybody in your business
Damn
Now what is really your main aim
When you are just a blotch and a stain on the planetary plane
Just another name in the phone book of fame
Bustin' out the seams it seems you haven't gained enough
To be seen in the right scene
Your thoughts they seem so convincing hmmm
But your actions don't follow through
Remember
Never say never because it never comes true
Your thoughts they seem so convincing for instance
You told me that you're a level higher
Liar
Element of desire earth and the wind and the fire
Not
You ain't even halfway hot
Not lukewarm you don't got no form
You (...?...)
All caught up in bein' waterproof
When you shoulda been tryin' to catch up w/the truth
For all intent and purposes your life on earth ain't worth it's weight in
Gold
That's probably why you get blowed
Cause people tell people things and people sell people things
That are useless and irrelevant
And it stifles my intelligence
I stay true

You know we keep it true - and we keep on and keep on and keep on
You know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true

You can mumble jumble if you got somethin' to say
But I doubt it's gonna affect me I row my boat steady
Everready is my battery description
Meaning I'm equipped to take long trips
And my brain cells overload when I get blowed
Gotta bring it down there's a point where the joint stops
Being passed through the fingers of a rhyme (?singers?)
The smoke from my last hit still lingers
Bring us your tired and your weary and your poor
I'm a take you higher while you're hearing metaphors
And similes
Assimilation of new creation
Mind emancipation
Rhymes command the nation
And so on and therefor and such and such
Dust to dust I thrust from the ground
W/no where else to go but up L.A. is where I'm found
Throwin' up sets and blowin' up sets and goin' up Stepney
About to get a heavy track
(?or jimmy in the spot?)
Or plenty of hip hop goin' round three
Heavyweights it's your time so register
Foundate your legacy we serve all them replicas
True style true style?
True style new style

You know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true we keep it true
You know we keep it true - the W and every crew we keep it true
We got to keep it true - from me to you do what you do just keep it
True
We got to keep it true - relax your mind w/the music

Now I'm gonna take my last verse on a good note
You better prepare your footnotes
Hold your wigs tight
Open up the middle
(?center me in the more?)
Words are the foundation action is the building and unity
And the concept to result in logic and the use of logic
Now the object to be neutral partial to a judgement
And the subject's concentration here is the pop quiz
What hip hop is

You know we keep it true - relax your mind w/the music
We got to keep it true - sit back and vibe to this true shit

The wrong thing to do is stop
