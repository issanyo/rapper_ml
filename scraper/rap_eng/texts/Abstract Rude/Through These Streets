[Intro]
This is a song about doing more than just holding on

[Chorus]
Through these streets, all the conscious people
We will take a stand, and do more than just hold on
Through these beats, I will conquer evil
We will stake the land, with a cypher that's so strong

[Verse 1]
Something about this music and the way that we produce it
Something you ain't used to
What could I do to make them beaucoup bucks?
What would I do but stay true to this stuff?
Be the most-wanted with out letting them claim you in the cuffs
It's three hots and a cop, better than what you already got
No, you want to better your life, feeling the most
Willin' the most, death row
As the death toll rise and the ghetto eyes, the weary
Dark skies show no signs of clearing
How could a nigga ease his pain, working at Micky D's?
Gain minimum wage with maximum need, it's struggle indeed
When there's mouth's to feed, no diploma or degree
That qualify you to own the facilities
Some of y'all just maintained
Hopping on and off the money train
But hold your own and pull your weight
And keeping running things

[Chorus]
Through these streets, all the conscious people
We will take a stand, and do more than just hold on
Through these beats, I will conquer evil
We will stake the land, with a cypher that's so strong
Through these streets, all the conscious people
We will take a stand, and do more than just hold on
Through these beats, I will conquer evil
We will stake the land, with a cypher that's so strong

[Verse 2]
In this game, you can't go wrong if you think with instinct
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link
Don't be that rotten apple that got in a battle with a bunch
He did his dance, shit his pants, lost his lunch
No floss to front, two things is so unnecessary
And that big head of yours
Gives a perfect aim to your adversaries (plow)
Over these beats, I channel feeling through vocabulary
I rode through the streets, like it or not, embarrassed
Words powers and parries, the ability to uplift a military
You'll really see the mystery of the libraries
Eyes very open, wise, very old
We learned from the elders one should never sell his soul
Rather keep a strong hold, firm grip control if you get blowed
Knowing to lay back and pay back all money owed

[Chorus]
Through these streets, all the conscious people
We will take a stand, and do more than just hold on
Through these beats, I will conquer evil
We will stake the land, with a cypher that's so strong
Through these streets, all the conscious people
We will take a stand, and do more than just hold on
Through these beats, I will conquer evil
We will stake the land, with a cypher that's so strong

[Outro]
Mass [?]
From a south-central [?]
This here is as deep as the shi-zay gi-zay
(Hold on)
Straight from the point of origin
