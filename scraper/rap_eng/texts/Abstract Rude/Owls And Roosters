[Verse One]
And you can hear the beat banging from far away
And you can see we keep changing with artistry
No matter how many rappers in the game there are today
No serving me cause lyrically you don't want no maylay
We take time with an entree and gourmet
Don't worry and don't hurry me with your "Orale holmes!"
You in the moment, get in on it
It takes you out late night and wakes you in the morning
We party long and past curf'
But still strong enough to wake up, yawn and back to work
We want to build and not destroy
And what's real about having no skill is to not be employed
Let's narrow down to the bone marrow
We care for style there's no tomorrow
You're here for now but your time's borrowed
We talk about it at the round table
The famous underground Versa Label
Got me torn like a tornado
To be scorned it can be prove fatal
On solid rock you remain stable
And have more peace than NATO
Get the cream cheese like bagel
And take a bow when they go "bravo"
"We got the styles" is our motto
Dummy
Promoter better have my money

Riiight
Rudebwoy don't have no money, no show
No herb, no show
No consciousness, no show
Revelation

[Hook]
Out with the owls and up with the rooster
We got the styles to alter the future
Out with the owls and up with the rooster
We got the styles to alter the future
Late night Elephant be on the drum computer
We got the styles to alter the future

[Verse Two]
We got the out with the owls up with the rooster style
Last night a woman loved me Kama Sutra style
Listening to Fat Jack's tape, it was necessary
Music is my sanctuary
When the candle got lit there was ceremony
[?] incense mandatory
When the day broke I woke and gave thanks
Cause life's to love, to live, to learn, now say it ain't
There fits a mold in my think tank
Like a sketch I would later paint
Then manifested at a later date
I heard the song long ago but faint
It came clearer as the change grew nearer
You can feel it's aura all hail furor of sound
Some of the purest ones abound in the L.A. underground
Be alert if you're doing your dirt
Up there beyond the clouds is a camera that works
First Big Brother in the sky, the eye
Kokadoodledoo in the dawn when the rooster howls
And writing rhymes on computer files
Now time didn't listen when we said "slow down"

Music is my sanctuary
Music is my sanctuary
Music is my life
Music is my life
Music is my sanctuary
Music is my sanctuary
Music is my life
Music is my life

[Hook]

[Zulu Butterfly Priest]
Time elapsing like the sand in the hourglass
How fast does this paint take to dry?
It's getting in my third eye
They paint hieroglyphics of the walls of the point of origin [?]
Our music rude
Like Native American shadow warriors
We paint our face preparing for the slaughter
To the human race
Paint
No brush needed
Think
No rush intended
Taint
When cipher comes together
Give thanks in music celebration
