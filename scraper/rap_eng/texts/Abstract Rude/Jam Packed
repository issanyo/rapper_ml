[Moka Only]
The gargoyle get the jam packed
Now it's time for Moka Only Mr. Amtrak
Locomotive rolling through you better stand back
I'll blow my air horn to fools on the damn track
Before I ransack
Horsepower high, multiple unit connection
Dynamic breaking
That's how we do it
Stretch it for miles
Etching smiles on these chairs (?)
And looks of frustration on faces of competitive heads
I'm lead footed, unless I get flooded
I mean weeded, if that's the case I'm bed headed
I get mudded with a cup if it that got sold
MC's can't put it down like Playstation controls
Weigh station overload, heavyweight, and snap the scale
Scorp sting, Moka Only, Ab, Prevail
What to expect but a neck breaking G-force
You get taken off course
Deep water sea horse

Left, left
Right, right
Front, front
Back, back
Top, top
Bottom, bottom
This jam is packed
That's how we got em'

[Abstract Rude]
Abstract get the jam packed
Anthrax scare, snare, kick, boom-bap
Feel the bass and side to side pancake
Damn strait the homie's lowriders can't wait
To bump the tape, CD, and the minidisc
It's going global feel the flows of these adventurous
MC's are the calvary
To challenge me is hideous
To mention me in a negative way is tragedy
Complete with assault and battery
You're just imaginary
And lacking every skill it takes to pack the place
And I'll bury the hatchet if you make me
The mic, to rock it, that's why it's held
I'm bridging the classes gap, lyrical wealth
The stage, to blaze it, that's my purpose on
They gather like a Rome circus act, earth is home

Left, left
Right, right
Front, front
Back, back
Top, top
Bottom, bottom
This jam is packed
That's how we got em'

[Prevail Wonder]
Prevail Wonder keeps the jam packed
I'll play the pumpkin carver
My words will work harder
Streets, stages, studios, and mic honor
Dive bombing gates of Orion
No one is safe from the claws of the Scor-pion
I'm warped on freons
What kind of trip am I on?
100% guaranteed to bleed
The shark tooth beach is the land of the freed
So step, barefoot, and neck to neck
You either walk off the plank or you die on the deck
My chainsaw gang ain't the same thing you come to know
Arches of cartilage are torn by the horns of the buffalo
Plain grazers watch for the eight leggers
My cycles unbridled
My title is the hooded breathtaker
You'll never even feel the pins that pinch you
But when you wake up in the morning
Adreneline is running in you
My aim will claim part of the fluid that runs to your brain
Let's run it again
My aim will drain some of the fluid that runs to your brain
What particles remain?
Blocking octane and you'll die in vein
From mine to the vein, tied to a train track
Pay no sling shot over rimshot
That's what got him shot
Jacked, and that's the game

[Abstract Rude]
Battle Axe get the jam packed
Code Name: Scorpion
There it is there
Be alert and beware
