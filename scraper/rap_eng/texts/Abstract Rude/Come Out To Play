Mass distortion the amps are screaming
Pandemonium in the B-Boy Kingdom
Destroy and sting 'em venemous sharp tip
Feeling his pen strokes
For women and men folk
Ab's recording for bastard orphans
All homes is broken life's in your hands
Don't let the moment stifle your plans
God bless the homeless no one supports them
Puffin' Alaskan or maybe some Oregon
Feel the wrath of Scorpion to your misfortune
Set the torches, my last one scorched 'em
Now they back for more of this natural order
'Stract is sort of addictive on ya
Strong as a prescription for some pure ganja
Code of Honor and secret holdin'
From the oldest shamen to youngest, quote it in

(chorus)
Warriors, come out to play-ee-ay-ee-ay (Where my warriors at? Where my warriors at?)
With swords and shields and guns and knives
With pens and pads turntables mics we're
Warriors, come out to play-ee-ay-ee-ay (Where my warriors at? Where my warriors at?)
With chains and bats brass knuckles pipes
With rhymes I write that can shed some light on this

Mass confusion the spotlight beaming
Trip like illusions in colliseums
My contribution will fry their braincells
Blaze a tight rhyme now it's time to raise hell
We come with the bomb and best cuts
And when the show's over your hair is messed up like
Mass distortion grabbin' the porcelain
Drunk too much gin throw it back up nauseous
Cautious, do not drink too much nightly don't know
When my last day here might be
Rights of passage, life's a math test
Add up your successes and losses clashes
With arch-rivals, we tribal
My whole discography's a Bible
Don't bite your idols
Won't play high-post
But when I sleep it's only one eye closed, niggas

(chorus)
