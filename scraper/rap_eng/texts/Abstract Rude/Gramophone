[Chorus: Myka 9]
When I'm home alone I just listen to my gramophone
Cool
I love the sound of tone, remind me of the one my grandma own
Groove
I'm in a special zone, I put a record on my gramophone
Smooth
And this world has shown me that life like a gramophone
True

[Verse 1: Myka 9]
From an antique shop I stopped by the [?] no phonographic record player
Dropped it off at the spot and I thought to myself that I'm probably gonna use it later
I demanded  job, yeah poppa already know, automatic stacking paper
Got a boss up the top, find a slop for my wealth and I gotta try to do it major
When I found some free time to sit down and recline and get some peace of mind and clear my head
And the sound from rewind going 'round and I found a needle on the 45" instead
It's so amazing how it's playing on this song with not
The conveying but it's saying what to song to me is
That the making is related to all-knowing creator of music, music
The Earth keep spinning, just keep on breaking, you'll soon be winning, don't forget who thank
And when you're feeling frustrated just be happy that you made it this far down the ro-o-oad

[Chorus: Myka 9]
When I'm home alone I just listen to my gramophone
Cool
I love the sound of tone, remind me of the one my grandma own
Groove
I'm in a special zone, I put a record on the gramophone
Smooth
And this world has shown me that life like a gramophone
True

[Verse 2: Abstract Rude]
Oh brother where art thou searching the land?
On the run you got a voice while I heard it's man
That will pay you for your talent if you sing into a can
And if you play the banjo in a jail urban
[?] the audio the way he would bluegrass
Soon this music will enter every citizen's home
With the Edison 1910 gramophone
Still remember the underground railroad
All through the struggles, some old negro spirituals
And hymnals
What was before blues and country? Gospel
Aretha Franklin from a [?] Jackson
Now King Cole best said it
No time like the present for making a record
It's all phonetic, sound transmitted with static
Mix of vibraphones, violins, xylophones
On my gramophone

[Chorus: Myka 9]
When I'm home alone I just listen to my gramophone
Cool
I love the sound of tone, remind me of the one my grandma own Groove
I'm in a special zone, I put a record on my gramophone
Smooth
And this world has shown me that life like a gramophone
True

[Verse 3: Myka 9]
When a man see a lot I got my original automatic groovy neighbor
I'm not lost in the sauce but the talk is the help from mechanically smoothing savor
And I stand in problem, started getting heavy, no more addicts and reckless capers
Using stealth when I'm out to pursue some labor


Since a child I been wild I freestyle for a mile to get the street life off of my head
Out of town at a time when people don't know if I'm alive or dead
So I'm staying for a way for my home up in the land
But we playing in the brain is what my gramophone keep saying
Related to all-knowing creator of music, music
The Earth keep spinning, just keep on breaking, you'll soon be winning, don't forget who thank
And when you're feeling frustrated just be happy that you made it this far down the ro-o-oad

[Chorus: Myka 9]
When I'm home alone I just listen to my gramophone
Cool
I love the sound of tone, remind me of the one my grandma own
Groove
I'm in a special zone, I put a record on the gramophone
Smooth
And this world has shown me that life like a gramophone
