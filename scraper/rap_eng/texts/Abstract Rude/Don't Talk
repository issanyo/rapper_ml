[Intro]

A smooth one, yeah
Come on
You know every now and then life gets a little hectic for me I gotta just
Take a sec, sit back, and rethink my schedule, you know what I mean?

[Verse]

There's too much on your plate
So if you learn anything from your mistakes
Then maybe you should just slow down (slow down)
The world is moving so fast, how could I?
You always finishing last, when you the good guy
Head looks to the sky you can't never let them hold you down
Shoot you down
The future tells me there'll be: consumers, producers
And beggars, can't be, choosers
Users can't be shakers, and movers
Talkers are not doers
To walk the walk is truer
They always talk in rumors
(Hush now)

[Chorus]

Don't talk just peek the music (not a word)
Don't talk just peek the music (don't say nothin)
We've got the new exclusive (hush now)
Something that you folks can groove with

(Yeah that's what I'm talkin 'bout)
(Takin it back to the days [?])
(Groovy, you know what I mean?)
(Let's get everybody movin right now)

[Verse 2]

Let's take a second and chill
Instead of always tryna tear it down let's build
And maybe we could just joke around
Smoke a pound
And go down to the disco lounge
Because, it isn't a crime to have a good time
So you should unwind
Kick back and just relax your mind
And have some wine
Let's enjoy life before we hit flatline
It's best to never settle for less
And no more using cigarettes to cope with the stress
It's overdue for you to put those down
To just slow down
Slow down
Slow down (hush now)

[Chorus]

Don't talk just peek the music (not a word)
Don't talk just peek the music (don't say nothin)
We've got the Macadoshis (hush now)
Something that you folks can groove with

[Verse 3]

Manage your anger better
Don't drink too much liquor
Because it's a bigger picture energy that's dealing whicha
[?] your head up
Won't let you think quicker
Many a night I do regret confrontation with competitors
But, I never said I was innocent of the tendencies of human beings
I gotta deal with who I'm seeing in the
Looking glass
Put in a bad spot I gotta
Still rock and show 'em what I've got
There's not , crowd where I didn't blow up the spot
About a hundred thousand independent to cop
But at the mom and pops
One stops in the chain stores
Top notch in this game of entertainers
It's a shame you gotta dumb down
I wise up
Besides I ain't nothing like ya
Nothing like ya (hush now)

[Chorus]

Don't talk just peek the music (not a word)
Don't talk just peek the music (don't say nothin)
(Hush now)

[Outro]

Just slow down, you know what I'm saying?
Take some time for you
You and your fam
That's what I'm talkin 'bout
