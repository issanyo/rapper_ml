Night Shift

I'll be on the night shift
I won't be home till late, my sweetie
And if I don't make it home by morning, I could be cheating
Man she had me all wrong
I was just working graveyard
I didn't get home till late, my darling
But if I wasn't back at the house by the morn
She acted like a woman scorned
Aggravation, I'm not cheating but I might as well 'cause that's what you're thinking

Hell's no fury like a woman who was treated the wrong way first
Because if I didn't say I love you daily, the relationship got worse
So where's the quality time
Fine wine and dining
We used to have dinners by candlelight
She wants to feel like when we first were dating
To serenade and sing
I used to tell her that you're my Juliet
Your Romeo's a Scorpio
But who am I to sing the stone forever
Just never let you go
Cheating on the night shift

Night shift caught the doctor, the nurse
The naughty nurse caught the priest with the nun
White lies and deceit
What we breathe with our lungs
Spun a web of deceit
Won't believe what we've done
'Till we've done it
One filthy night shift left feeling guilty
Didn't wanna do it but we had to act upon it
Gone and did it, time to hit it
When the original significant other gone undercover come stone cold dead
Nah I'm not cheating, but I might as well 'cause that's what you're thinking
Lost deep in an anonymous crush
Cheating on someone you promised to love
An optimistic fuck but it's hard to live up to it
Promiscuity is hard to dream up
Temptation is a son of a bitch
Why don't you face him or become what he is
Lying to a family and kids
Damn it, screw it, I didn't do it
It wasn't me
Who's sly as a fox and cunning
Me? No, couldn't be
Oh baby, don't break up with me for publicity sake
Oh baby, don't break up 'cause the comments on MySpace
It might take a little foward thinking notion
But you're incapable of forgetting york
You get vindictive spells cast
Because hell hath no fury
Take his cash, his jewellery, his youth and his health
Because all he's done to you has just done to himself
So he deserves to feel the same pain you once felt
Nah, I'm not cheating, but I might as well 'cause that's what you're thinking

I'll be on the night shift
I won't be home till late, my sweetie
And if I don't make it home by morning, I could be cheating
Man she had me all wrong
I was just working graveyard
I didn't get home till late, my darling
But if I wasn't back at the house by the morn
She acted like a woman scorned
Like quit the night shift, cut down working
I'll stop wondering, I'll stop flirting
Aggravation, I'm not cheating but I might as well because that's what you're thinking

I'll be on the night shift
I won't be home till late, my sweetie
And if I don't make it home by morning, I could be cheating
Man she had me all wrong
I was just working graveyard
I didn't get home till late, my darling
But if I wasn't back at the house by the morn
She acted like a woman scorned

Mischief on the night shift
