It's all, it's all becoming to clear to me
There appears to be something that you do not know about
Something about this music
Somn', something about this music

(x2)

Still young but I'm old
Pursuing the truth in goal
Trying to produce from the soul
Backing me is a force, my greatest resource
So when you ride this rhyme you be the rhyme horse
This rhyme is a compass
Designating the direction of your mind as you want this
The dope beats don't cease
Not for player haters
But the appreciators of what we release
Heavyweights will take a stand and show your flow is nice
They'll pass the mic like Montana would throw to Rice
A prime from the mind to the wickedness
They ride on the dance floor like the Nicholas
Brothers, Tribe Unique discovers
Different ways, visually stimulating displays of movement
Groovy groovy slide, watch me do this step
Let's see if you can vibe to how deep does it get

(chorus)

Emcees flowing deep and wide, deep and wide
Cali earthquake impact when me and the beat collide
Smack dab, dropping like a Reggie Miller clutch three
Leaving emcees saying "Fuck me"
Ooh, but don't get vulgar just cause I provoked ya
You're all vultures, our music is the prey
We do this every day
You swoop down in your six-four
Bumping ATU through alpines
But please, time's down, dogs up
The Project Blowedians be the first to battle, that's what you call guts
Caps peeled back by verbal weapon
You hear them tracks, feel back, you heard us flexin'
Manifestation, switch the station
To de-program the robots
The ones who Acey calls Knownots
Tell your whole block cause it's the sure shot

(chorus)
