[chorus]
Do's and don'ts
Will's and won'ts
Basic instinct's going to make you think

[verse 1]
It's what you do not what you did.
Boy, grew up from the kid.
Never knew what it is, was or going to be.
So if you don't live life humbly
You might feel the sting of bumble bee.
You've tried it before but don't front on me
No more.
Because I'm really inside, we never feel this vibe, we never get it right.
We ignore.
But still I try till the day I die to throw away my pride
And be pure.
What I came here for is to relate to your divine force to ?? bring toward
Story tales.
So I hope in jail, you can send me mail.
I'm on tour.

[hook]

[verse 2]
Now who you know who you are,
Everyone you know was a star in somebody's eyes,
Not whom you see from afar.
Too many drinks at the bar got us dying inside.
Trying to find escape, many times a day I just ride away.
When depression sets in I stress my best friends though I'm to blame.
Because I know inside I got a focused mind ability, so I can make
Change.
Now it's no denying me. soldier, i will just hold the line and take
Aim.
With my goals in mind I put in overtime. there's no game to find with no
Pain.

[verse 3]
Now where you're from, where you're at.
Young and don't know how to act.
Yeah, I've done that once, twice, a dozen times
Out late night with a cousin of mine.
At 15 sticking out mob's car
Just to enjoy ride to ??
So dumb and ignorant of consequences,
And didn't get caught. what a bomb adventure.
Karma came with a long detention.
I'm taggin in school and I got suspended.
Guess we never escape punishment.
To all of my old friends, wishing we regained friendship.

[hook]

[verse 4]
Now why I've done what I did?
Why am I doing what I do?
Because I'm mad at the world, my girl and a gang of people.
Dam! we feel angry when no one needs you
Unloved and you out of loot
But it's just paranoia to tell you the truth
Because your friend's still loyal and so are you
You're over the turmoil and born anew
Pan it all out or go impromptu
Can't nobody tell what you're going to do
It's your life. so in this one you live ?? may get you all you get because its
Priceless
That's right. and to the youngest kids you got to learn what is the right path.
Your family's advice
