Welcome, the world is so different
Rebelion's excepeted
From those who ain't with it, unite
But what could we do to change it
It's so big
It starts by how you could change your own life

Make a clean sweep
?
?
Whatever, something
Not just about money

We make ?
In this days, weeks, months, year
Having no fear
And that's what I call hungry
Travel accross country
To promote it
Like a locomotive rollin'
I ain't tired yet

Been on the battlefield
That's what the rap does, ? it
An other session, I accept it
Let's get it on

Similar to rams
We interlock, I penetrate
Seems it can happen to any men, to violate
The violence, we shouldn't tolerate
I get, annihilate all of the petty shit
Be wide awake

The vibrations
We always show respect
And be on the down low
Altough some come for test

Follow me down
A stream of consciousness, large in this
I got the conch, you gotta listen
On every continent there is an other tradition
Never wanna strain in a corrupt prison
Trust the system we don't
To get a fair shake
They say you will, but you probably won't
Follow me down
A stream of consciousness, large in this
I got the conch, you gotta listen
