[Intro - Abstract Rude]
Ugh, ugh, Living Legends
Ugh ugh, Ab Rude
Mass Men, another West Coast connect
From L.A. to the Bay bwoy
We ain't just bout it, y'all hear about it
Ugh ugh, when you hear about it, when you hear about it

And so it was said
People remember the Legends
And as it was read
Masses of men get the message
(And you hear about it)
When you livin in the cities of the Bay
(And you hear about it)
When you livin in the city of L.A
(And you hear about it)
When you livin in the cities of the Bay
(And you hear about it)
When you livin in the city of L.A

And so it was said, and created affirmative
Born rappin, German, they fertilised amino acids
Matter with mass, intricate plot
That or just ask infinite questions in a scientific melting pot
As it was read, when activated a new permanent
Geographic, made it possible to inhabit
Thieves of air, water of blood, livin off the land
Grown from the mud, thoughts of a man
Are the building blocks of pyramid Egyptian
Stone wall inscriptions that told all of myths and mythology
Depictions and prophecy, crucifixion and casualty
Communication by telepathy
Exceptionally gifted, man lifted his mental existence
Went to the distance, geometric inches
Of math, he clinches his nostalgic pass
Underground fossils found in solid rock
Evolution of the mind, look at precision of the tool of the trade
Decisions of a fool never made
The revolution of rhyme is like when man started talkin
Somethin new to hear, ears hawkin by choice
The voice of hip hop, Mother Earth, generation X
I know what I'm sayin so some next, but you gon' hear about it

And so it was said
People remember the Legends
And as it was read
Masses of men get the message
(And you hear about it)
When you livin in the city of the Bay
(And you hear about it)
When you livin in the city of L.A

People remember the Legends
And as it was read
Masses of men get the message
(And you hear about it)
When you livin in the cities of the Bay
(And you hear about it)
When you livin in the city of L.A

[Living Legends]
Now could I join, both sides of a coin forming one whole?
Warning one's soul that this power is too swole
To be reckoned with, effective, give the respect where it's due
I live like I know so expect that I do the true
Test of my talents, living by my word, speech balance
While my actions have em latching on like velcro
Conceited? Hell no, I be, seated in the front row
Of your lecture, I betcha, if you have somethin to learn me
Earn the attention, test my retention, and best my intention
Is to be great, recognise or be late
To the function, gathered in conjunction with my folks
Up and down the coast, we toast, to tightness
Ignite this flame, recite this game back, apply it if I came wack
Deny it or riot, quiet, on full volume
You're all tuned in, when the time's right
Grab the rippy now but you can't hear me, there's no limelight
I gather up my style, bounce flip it, bubble off and rip it
Come equipped and ship it out for you to hear about

Have you heard about the time the man slept, and crept up in cotton?
Visualisin such a mysterious movie of a life
I lived it twice before I entered
Remembered as a superhuman, inventions I invented
The thought of not, I'm bendin the rules I's meanted
Content with the life without politician's decisions
Makin my dimension an unstable form
A habituation, watchin us, you know just waitin
For a chance to get inside, the centre of divine
Principles, it's his to pull yourself, OUT
When you're sunk below your chin, the light - it never ends
No matter where it has begun
A millennium of sights to see before the rays of the sun
I'm knowin how long it shall be glowin
Shall I continue showin y'all
The lighter side from the shadows where they seem to hide
Revitalisin with a rhyme that abides by the soul
That resides behind the focus of my eyes glow
A legendary myth that carries the gift of surprise though

[Ab Rude] And you hear about it, and you hear about it

And so it was said
People remember the Legends
And as it was read
Masses of men get the message
(And you hear about it)
When you livin in the city of the Bay
(And you hear about it)
When you livin in the city of L.A

And so it was said
People remember the Legends
And as it was read
Masses of men get the message
(And you hear about it)
When you livin in the city of the Bay
(And you hear about it)
When you livin in the city of L.A

[Living Legends]
It's the crystal method, see through evidences at hand
Standin across two properties, eye of the perfect detective
Vision's reflective at attention, my invention
Something from a time you have endured, subdued, by ghost in tune
To most they only feel the full moon, they parked outside
In the world we live in, give in to the signal, they sinkin
Depths are driven to drive into a pole, enter your soul
The soul has risen, partake on a mission
Moon Apocalypse, Now they see the picture, ??? pass the mixture
To fix the future, elixir with a suture
Mutations fade to inner ???, the name is Melancholy
Walk with a frown when the fall leaves falling
My answering machine when they're calling, sounds across the washroom
Clean your face for the dirty looks you pass are scrappy
Bury the negativity, for it's affecting me gravity
Physically, Cali, heavenly, let me be

[Outro - Abstract Rude]
And you hear about it
In the cities of the Bay

When you livin in the city of L.A

Masses of men get the message

You livin in the city of the Bay
When you livin in the city of L.A
