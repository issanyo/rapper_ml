[Intro: Abstract Rude]
Thou art infinite, infinite art thou
As we Blast, off
Into infinity then it is ???
Abstract Rude,
Zulu
Yemeni prince

[Verse 1: Abstract Rude]
Blast off into infinity, i stay vivid and you love it
Flips up rearrange up change up my rhythm and you love it
Whose illiterate to this?
Huh? i dunno, well that
I don't care
Strap got yo back
Word, come here
Step, spin, slide, up and around, to the visual
"ooohhh" To the audio sound it's a miracle
Ill spiritual vibe, is alive
Why, this? It'll get much clearer, check it out, check it out
Journey in this hell, when you're trying to learn well
Babylons a jail, that i rebel
Ain't no water for a fire that's already burned
You got to earn what you keep be you need to learn
Give thanks

[Hook: Abstract Rude]
Blast off into infinity, i stay vivid and you love it
Flips up rearrange up change up my rhythm and you love it
Blast off into infinity, i stay vivid and you love it
Flips up rearrange up change up my rhythm and you love it
Blast off, blast off

[Verse 2: Abstract Rude]
Break through by the millions
Way way needed, much easier said than done
Nah man they don't wanna hear that
*zoom zoom* What was that? Its a Zulu flying
A ?? , What will become of the future
Word to the year two thousand
Five hundred and eight years it'll be
Slaves keep on housing,
Don't seem to me like we that free
Poison in the water,
I think Columbus spiked the punch
Poison ain't a bother
See my frustration light the blunt
*woo* feel that, now
When you have lost your true identity
You must throw up, from the blow up
Throw up you're hood, instead of good intentions
Some cats strapped you know about that
Goin to the party with the go-in with a gat
Mmm blast off into infinity
Little villain niggas got energy
Therefore they get locked up in facilities
Breaking and entering, highway robbery
Two eleven, one eighty seven
All products of poverty
Obviously, this happens periodically
It's not me, it's the god in me
Gotta be twist turned jumped, leaned, dipped, split
Come back up and begin to rip, flip
I and I by and by I have become
With a lit fuse blast
Off

[Hook: Abstract Rude] x2

[Outro: Abstract rude]
While you stay here, you know where I'm going
Where are you going? You just hanging around
Into infinity, he hay, all the way live from the 215
Blastin' off with the masked men
Infinity is on, on is infinity
