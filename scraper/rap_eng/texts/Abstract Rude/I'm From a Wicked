[Intro:]
Yeah first of all my name is abstract rude from ATU
And Mass Men putting it straight down
Now fools want to get real open on all these mixtapes out here
You know those underground tapes that get around that ain't really legit
But everyone seems to hear what fools be saying a gang of shit some poppin' off at the lip
Well listen, (takes hit) 'cuz
I done heard a couple, and had something to say to a couple
*im from a wicked* Check it out

[Verse 1]
I'll, pry your head of glory
If you try to diss me abstract, well it's my territory
I'm, fed up with all you folks
Heh, you got jokes, I'm down with Doggs and Loccs
The god appreciates my occupation, I'm staying humble
So I've been blessed by my creation
They wanna know where im from though
Not where you from but where you at
Nevertheless, thoughts not just verses from the abstract
Its, not a quest but, but a long road
Wanna see the west serving you at project blow
You gon bust my west coast shit but I'mma get you with rapping
Anyway you want to play it i'll say it it'll happen, ah ah ah

[Hook]
Im from a wicked x2
The job is to relate through sway of the beat
We from LA and we unique, ah
The God appreciates my occupation
Its real though, so i've been blessed by my creation, ah ah ah
(Who is it!?) Its ab darlin' and tribe unique from 59th street

I'm, from a wicked ,neighborhood where threes madness
Rhyme, was my ticket
Was all so talking masses, ghetto bastard
But a good home training, while i was gaining years i was
Maintaining knowledge and by the time i picked up a mic i was polished
They said i was on some other shit and tried to abolish
But man i can't call it, all i do is my music and get real blowed
And projects and the object is to let the people know
So, merrily, merrily I say un to the Mass
Men has it (What's that) ghetto gats go blast
Off into infinity the energy of this vibe
Day to day struggle, gotta hustle to survive
I'm from a wicked x2
Even though we from the hood, can't be misunderstood, its all good

[Hook]
I'm from a wicked x2
The job is to relate through suede of the beat
We from LA and we unique ah
Through god appreciate my occupation
Its real though, so I've been blessed by my creation, ah ah ah

[Verse 2]
Times, are to wicked
We caught up in this madness, obituary listed
This youngster just got blasted, where we gon' put these caskets
Cemetery full, the prisons very full, the missions very full
Not every one is fed but everywhere is full
3 kids hit the street, one kid goes to school
I was on 4 kids but the one way walk did
That makes me a better person being from a wicked
But why should i be caught up and shot up somewhere addicted
Forget how they depicted, luckily i maintain
One destiny, one love, one pain ah ah ah

[Hook]
Im from a wicked x2
The job is to relate through suede of the beat
We from LA and we unique ah
Through god appreciate my occupation
Its real though, so I've been blessed by my creation, ah ah ah
Its ab darlin' the tribe unique from 59th street

[Outro]
I'm from a wicked x3
God appreciate it, what we create
Masked men, what you know about that x2
Mood pieces, by ATU, yeaaah fool, we out like that
Masked men, mood pieces by atu
Can you guess the mood I'm in now? x3
Its real tho
Yeah check it let these fools know, ya know what I'm sayin'
Fools think just cause they do something in the underground
That it ain't gon' get back to the underground
But I'm telling the underground, *laughs*

I'm from a wicked x3
