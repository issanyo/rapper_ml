[Intro]

[Hook: Luckyiam]x2
Ever wonder why we’re never truly satisfied with life
Under the knife in the microscope hope grows larger
As the day runs marathon length
This is Yo Life
Tell me what you think

[Verse 1: The Grouch]
Everyone came the same no name
To stain the train trail
We bail like bondsmen on em words
Like turds all fun
Spunk speech reach to peak I'm no punk
The crunk I'm all drunk
Sunk like bait you're bite I can't wait
Straight fate friction eviction from this
You're sick, I'm like leverage ahead of this time
Better kids die like eta-piss
I'm like Rederick used to fuse
The unknown in the zone
Foos better get going
I'm knowing who's owing, not me
I got free speech like that's the jackpot
See Yahtzee, don't roll like my whole life seven
Swoll keep peddling, meddling my way
Settling high stay low with the know
Slow with the stroll I'm swoll in the whole with soul
When I roll over flowing the bowl
Knowing the goal I'm whole...
Knowing
I said I'm knowing the goal I'm whole...

[Hook]x1
Ever wonder why we’re never truly satisfied with life
Under the knife in the microscope hope grows larger
As the day runs marathon length
This is Yo Life
Tell me what you think

[Verse 2: Eligh]
In the blink of an eye
You can catch your life passing by
Like traffic on a map
In a wrapper
On the few ways of life
In a cipher of many
Catch a bag full of pennies
Or match a flag to the finish line
How I plan to finish mine?
Man I came to win at this
No one can diminish this is testing my existing
Is an everlasting presence
In the game of life on the central
Medium with a pencil
Etching out my full credentials
Mental packed with an atom bomb
Cause I can have em calm or in a frenzy
That's the way I function
Crunching like my teeth
I believe I can see the future
Feel like a rain drop plummeting
Iridescent nature wasn't built to hate another human being
My rapture
Capturing the purity dubbed when the crow
I bring minds back from the dead
Mission to uphold wisdom
That's the newest
Bringing them from the colder truths
Who is Gandalf? (Ahhhh...)
Legs crossed like a Buddhist
Unarmed when I'm in the standoff
Only when I keep my hands offthe sack
Decorated with math
That you could never contemplate
Less you calculated my beats
Evaporated my beasts
Dilapidated my cleats
You can't walk the path of taken
Man you're life's been forsaken
Taken back to the essence
Legendary accomplishments still
Trying to fill my cup
Trying to fill it up to the heavens
I live by the number seven
Give what I have forever
Never selfish in my learning
Share what I'm earning
But I'm not concerned with your burning
Cause a new leaf I'm turning
I keep living, I keep moving
I keep turning, I keep living, I'm revolving...

[Hook]x1
Ever wonder why we’re never truly satisfied with life
Under the knife in the microscope hope grows larger
As the day runs marathon length
This is Yo Life
Tell me what you think

[Verse 3: Luckyiam]
A blank stare into the wall
Watch his mind start to shift in
Hard to believe that all things
We say, "make em listen"
Believe it though even those
True triple hero's come hard to find
Because they barely swallow pride
No matter what you think
My thoughts sink on surge
Wishing to find others who feel this way
And listen this answer but
Causes chaos in the klutz
So I keep that in mind
When my pen feels to touch a stroke
No lip though my life known its ropes
For beginners to learn as new poets
Take they turn and earn
But life is a bundle of weak
Its free drinks and freeze
With a hell of a beat
You need...

[Verse 4: Aceyalone]
This is yo life tell
Me what you think
What you thought
Tell me what you've been taught
Spin the wheel and
You might just burn for real
Go ahead spin the wheel
You could fight the man of steel
Be all that you can be
Be free even though life costs an arm and a leg on me
I count every minute existing
And I suggest you do the same
Cause life just ain't a game
Momentum is gain it intensifies the pain
But I'm healthy, I'm alive, and I can't complain
I sleep good some nights
Some nights I toss and turn
What happened to all your time
You must have got lots of burns
And you lost your turn
Missed your turn
Now you're heading on a dead end road
What did you learn
Tell me what you think
Then put it on ink
We're on the brink of something new
The missing link

[Hook]x1
Ever wonder why we’re never truly satisfied with life
Under the knife in the microscope hope grows larger
As the day runs marathon length
This is Yo Life
Tell me what you think

[Verse 5: Abstract Rude]
Only pacify when you satisfy
I had the pride of the seven deadly
But my brethren wouldn't let me go astray
So many fall by the way side
Know on any day we could all die
And who's to be the fall guy
For the lost tribe the thoughts
Hired vibes should be locked in archives
The pop is our lives
The bright lights and prize flights
Rep on the line step through the minefield
Break through the time barrier shield
To peel caps back somebody gotta do it
Abstract put the future on the map
Now who could exactly put it down like that
And who could adapt to this many laps around a track
The long winded you felt just long after the song ended
I'mma rap i strongly recommended even through the tinted windows
Or my every now and then limos
They speak on me like they my kin folks
And we been close for years
But that microscope is not welcome around here
Little man difficult, simple man cool
Its typical you might have to fist fight a fool
Gotta crew there and write a few off
Kept what I earned I pay the high cost
This is yo life, are you the boss?
