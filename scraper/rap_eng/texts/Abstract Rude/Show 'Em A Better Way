Show 'em a better way
We got to show em a better way

[Verse One: Abstract Rude]
Show them the poem I wrote
Low and behold it's so dope you get high
Highly anticipated (the vibe we generated)
Wildly imitated
We’ve demonstrated this is what can happen when you’re an innovator
Show em your battling scars
We had our share of facing challenges hard
Acey and Abstract send our regards
To who we dethrone enemies own engagement on the microphone
Same shit we been on for
Them styles are growing wild like weed plants
Even if they are in or out of season
Spit at em at a gold and they be in a black minivan
Get at em them on the low the word they do is freelance
Once again back is the invincible
With a pencil tool and who could have wrote it better?
I hope you never doubt it crowded as they game gets
A decade of underground hits the crowd's favorites

[Hook]
Before they all go astray double A
They getting fooled Ab Rude
We got to show them a better way
Before you loose hope in your folks
Them other crews don’t even come close
Show em a better way
Who better to rep LA?
Who called for the A team?
Show 'em a better way
Show 'em a better way
Show 'em a better way
Show 'em a better way
We gotta show 'em a better way

[Verse Two: Aceyalone]
Shoe you a better way
A better day
Blow 'em forever away never say never say
Say what you need to say, whatever is necessary
Forever is temporary and a bus don’t go there
Its rolled through a detour and the Blow got a show there
We take the honor rode they take the dollar trail
They eat each other in the end it’s like a living Hell
Follow my path but not my footprints
Every man got his own sense of innocence and dominance
I’m convinced
These events will shape the person or make it all worse and
I know they are thirsting they’re hungry and tired
They’re about to burst into flames like a wild fire
Mark my word, spark some herb
Watch out for the curbs
This that and the third
You’ll get what you deserve
Fuck what you heard
We show them a better way

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Abstract Rude]
They buried us we budded like a rose

[Aceyalone]
They gave us nothing so we took control

[Abstract Rude]
They tried to break us but now we are on the breakers

[Aceyalone]
We came from the ashes through movers and shakers

[Abstract Rude]
And our intention is to reach a new dimension

[Aceyalone]
The rap we mention make music an extension

[Abstract Rude]
In this intersection I might just want a red light

[Aceyalone]
Get you spirit and your lyrics in your head tight

[Abstract Rude]
You said it right I never could forget to pray

[Aceyalone]
I’m having no regrets for what I did or didn’t say

[Abstract Rude]
We in LA where everybody is a star

[Aceyalone]
We’ve all enjoy the spoils of war

[Abstract Rude]
We speak the truth to the youth and never keep the door closed

[Aceyalone]
So at the end of the day they always want some more flows

[Abstract Rude]
So let the DJ hit the record with a 7 fader

[Aceyalone]
And make some room for the tune of a heavy weighter

[Hook]
