[Verse 1: Sabac]
Yo, radiation rap, biochemical brutal massacre
Battlestar Galactica speed, I move like Gallagher
[?] cause of the army of millions
[?] they see the killing of civilians by the billions
It's D-day, we return to life, eternal sacrifice
Hold your holy deeds, we're supposedly gon' turn to ice
But memorise the antichrist, the coming of the afterlife
Results an armageddon, cause we still ain't get the answers right
Men and wife, babys and animals move [?]
Down to path of doom (nobody grins on your avenue)
One attitude attack the fool endulging and find
Once it exposed in the islands it'll be exposed to the silence
No one knows why they're dying, the energy is recycled
From enemies to this cycle this keys is mentioned in Bible
The death theory, descending the terror in the [?]
And the world that we once knew we disremember forever

[Hook x2: Necro]
Machines take over the Earth
It's time to fight
Explore the human brain
This is wiped out over night
It's technological war
I'm running, I'm out of breath
Explore the nucleus
There's only one hour left

[Verse 2: Mr. Hyde]
The six-headed beast, slowly crawls from the seeds
Get a modern decease, while sinners fall to their knees
The whole world's at the siege, by plagues, war and disease
Feel the [?]
Shape changers, rape strangers, the Earth's in great danger
Hell's angels of death kidnap Christ from an angel
You sure end has begun, the poison shredding your lungs
Now you can't scream, the damn demon severed your tongue
You left headless unharmed, the Four Horsemen have come
To mutilate the human race (rape and torture for fun)
All the slaughtered turn to zombies, with the hunger they're driven
To find their feast on the flesh of the rest of the living
The money maggots will rise and quickly metamorphosise
To the flies and derive plans of aid out your minds
Now the Devil's clawed hand tightly hold knives and cut
Till the end of the world's here, mankind is fucked

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Goretex]
We bring guns to space like Hubbard, my thoughts are sparking
Massacre body parts, leftovers to bust the marking
Canarsie to Marci with green flash like a mosh shit
Biodegradable, data clean, my tactics are squadron
Raising your flesh, faggot had to face the Koresh
Like Fran Tankerton they gave us parkinsons and ex
No survivors, we left you like H. R. Giger
Hiding the virus like some curtain scientologist pilot
Light you folding for double life, you dogging our semen
Closet is open ([?] like Morgan Freeman)
Transporting ACT's like caught [?] zebras
Billioinaires struggle with blood cells and drug placebos
[?] your raised, dirtiest flesh like [?]
Four dimensional Gore lives then return to Saturn
Cattle mutilation burn like crime circles of Maryl

[Hook x2]
