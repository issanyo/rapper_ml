[Verse 1: Sabac Red]

I have a dream of reaching Heaven
Me and Malcolm, we’re chatting
About impeaching presidents and how my album went platinum
I’m asking to ? out of the struggles inside of me
As a nation will develop and govern our own society
I dream of a time where there’s a cure for AIDS
And no longer will the people be afraid to get laid
Think how great it would be to stop choosing deception
When intelligent minds replace the nuclear weapons
I’m heading for a dream where the weed will be legal
The homeless will have homes and we can keep feeding the people
I need to see every father keep supporting his kids
Where hip hop entertains and remains informative
I dream the price of gasoline won’t rise no more
So that the innocent people don’t have to die for war
Or put an end to oppression, the fights and constant feuding
Have the people united, rewrite the Constitution
I have a dream

[Hook: Cenophia Mitchell]

I have a dream
I want to wake up to a revolution
I have a dream
People will rise up, become wiser
I waana see people uniting after the fighting
I have a dream but I gotta wake up now

[Verse 2: Dash Mihok]

I had a dream that my body, mind, and soul was united
The wrongs are all righted, I know how to be happy but fight it
I dream that I might have a little more control of my ticks
And hold a role in some flicks where I was boning a chick
And I could roll up to the Golden Globes laced in newly stolen clothes
And throw ? statue and a microphone
I have a dream that freestyle circles could be more supportive
And stop the spitting of the ? that we all get bored of
A dream where people see the dream is abundant
I fiend for a hundred but lend it friends that need it, not love it
Uncover the dream where people see a broken heart and go and mend it
Now go and play the part, it ain’t the art of co-dependence
I dream the only time the drama’s when we come up out our mamas
She could promise we’re protected from the bombers
I’mma dream about the day where the fear has been lifted
Shed a tear, grab a beer, and toast to the year of the gifted
I have a dream

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sabac Red]

I have a dream the media will build the minds of the youth
As opposed to holding us down, we’ll keep finding the truth
We won’t fall for what they showing us, no one will be owning us
Move towards Utopia and heal all the phobias
I have a dream all my fans will keep supporting me
Religion won’t be based on man’s organized conformity
It ought to be a time of us gaining our self-identity
Yo I dream for the power, the fame and wealth of the Kennedys
I enter these days with the intention to change
The death penalty and put lethal injections away
Its invention will save the lives of people addicted
Racism will be evicted, we’ll be equal to kick it
It’s a wicked world but we possess the power to change
The poverty, depression unless it is ours to claim
? believe a day to become what it means
I found it only right and fair to share some of these dreams

[Hook]
