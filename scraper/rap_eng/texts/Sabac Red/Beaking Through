[Verse 1]

Yo it feels good to wake up in the morning next to my wife
Give her a hug and a kiss then reflect on my life
The sunshine in California brightens my days
The move's supposed to be short but I've decided to stay
I'm from Brooklyn, my whole family's in New York
Surprise them every other month, it's me at the door
Go see my peoples from the block, you know how it is
Some people changed, some are the same, some are married with kids
And it's great to go home and see my friends do well
Although some still struggle, most fend for themselves
It's nice when you got people who support your goals
There's haters now and then but they won't cross my soul
I'm in control of my life, finally feel free
And there ain't nothing you can tell me that'll make me believe
I'm not supposed to be everything I know I am
If you're not being who you are, start rethinking the plan
Picture the world as a street, you see signs as it goes
It's like your life is a car, keep your eyes on the road
Sometimes you need to shift gears, backtrack and persist
You're the greatest gift you have, now I'm rapping to live

[Chorus x 2]

*Scratching*
Damn it feels good
Living in the world
Nowadays it been good
Feeling satisfaction from the street
I bet the sun'll shine tomorrow cause it feels so good

[Verse 2]

As I sit and write this verse I can't help but to think
How fortunate I am to be able to bring
My music to the world, so honest with these
Not everyone can do it, I feel honoured and pleased
The other day I thought about how when I was a youth
I would think about the future and the things I'd do
And I've actually done them, I choose to believe
I work with kids, tour the world, put out music CD's
Got married, got a house, got the greatest of friends
My mom and sister doing good, I feel creative again
I got a business in the works for 2009
? the brand, the lifestyle of mine
I can't wait to see the day where my child is proud
They got the love I never got from a father who bounced
And respect to my mom who held it down with twins
And all the mothers raising kids when dad bounced again
Being poor growing up we depended on love
With all the fights and hardships, we was meant to give up
But I never did, took my mistakes and grew
Life feels good when you're breaking through

[Chorus x 2]
