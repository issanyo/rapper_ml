[Jamal Joseph:]
I wish I had a revelation
Killing each other with MAC-10's, and
New Jack City schemes, some imprisoned
Doing time with their fathers, daughters
On the corner turning chicks with their mothers, and
Yes, accidents do happen but, not this much
Confusion is running high, and morality is
Running low, and
Genocide spelled with an A is still, genocide...
I wish I had a revelation
Something swift and righteous or song that fires
Bullets of enlightment into
The target of sleeping minds
Cosmic ammunition that glitters like the notes from
Giant coltranes [?] a force that takes us way way up
Above the lies and the madness
Into the plain of a
Love supreme
