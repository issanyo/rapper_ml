[Verse 1: I'll Bill]
Listen to Art Bell, Cookie Puss like Carvel
Bulletproof like Luca age 12 Marvel
Bohemian Grove speaking Elohimian code
Under the table sale of reptilian skulls
Sherm, purple pill, word to Bill, murder guild, burn your face
Burger grill meatloaf head Gucci and cokeheads
A Lopez wannabe, Scarface operated
Another Scarface incarcerated
He said dude, bro, had a jew fro, looked like Tony Kukoc
High glucose and blood sugar drug boogers
Trouble shooters, double Grey Goose
Trey deuce in the bubble goose
Hundred proof, who the fuck are you?
Came through with a Brooklyn face
Jordan started undefeated in this to crooked taste
Blew a whole in the wall and took the safe
Got knocked, got a nose job and blew the case
Then knocked again cause after surgery he looked the same

[Hook:]
Easy to tell, fuck with me and I will see you in Hell
The unfuckwithable, the uncrushable
There ain't no stopping the unstoppable

Easy to tell, fuck with me and I will see you in Hell
The unfuckwithable, the uncrushable
There ain't no stopping the unstoppable

[Verse 2: Sicknature]
They tell him break a leg so he can start off on the wrong foot
And go stomping toward the coffin coughing the wrong hook
Loosen his numerals son of [?]
While the industrial tumors grow
The whole fucking world is a Truman Show
A true to first like I'm fucking smacking your Tonka
They come with war tech, they're smarter than Hannibal Barca
Personality sniper strikes till every bastard is lifeless
The newest fancy gadgets, using tracking devices
They be sniffing your route when you chill on a couch
They planted shit in your house claiming that you dipping your snout
But the law points fingers from the villains it's out
Every third pig is using bricks when building his house
A rough world, nobody's staged and accidents happen global
From the fucking Titanic to the factories in Chernobyl
But you keep standing firm so keep turning it louder
Keep banging your head so your cranium turn into powder
He's uncrushable

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sabac Red]
I do dirt then wash my hands with the water of Satan
Reverse the roles and merge the souls, see the god in it's making
Shaking exorcism mathematics science and pagans awaiting death
While life is lived in the lines of the pavements
Creating off seeds, we all bleed and thirst for blood
Invading beats, chasing dreams facing curse of love
It's kinda bugged when your affection doesn't match your intentions
And attention that you gain is only based on when you're mentioned
Dreading Armageddon I'm forgetting all of the rules
Possessed by pussy greedy drugs and never letting them lose
Cruise ships got surveillance when we vacate with the aliens
And share notes and Ambien the State we're preparing them
Be wary of their lies and deceitful truths
The scary minds are the wise and streets is proof
We move fast and try to last for the rest of the way
Because tomorrow should better than yesterday's today
