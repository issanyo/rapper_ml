[Intro: Q-Unique]
At the end of 2003, an estimated 42 million people worldwide were living with HIV and AIDS. 70% of these people, that's 29.4 million live in South Africa

1975 they created AIDS inside a laboratory!

[Verse 1: Sabac]
I'm preparing a technical experimental chemical event
That will affect your ventricles fluid collected in your testicles
Bloodstream and genitals causing grieving and pain
Leaving you braindead, heathen bleeding squeezing your veins
In these days of [?] power you’ll never suspect the doings
Of another prized scientist to project and ruin
People’s lives with diseases that only affect humans
You can’t find the cure in animal testing or transfusions
Man, I can’t wait, this feeling is great
I can’t believe how much the government is willing to pay
I start killing the gays, Latins, black and white trash
Then the young folk and just hope there won’t be a backlash
I'll laugh last on the paths that minimise population
God forgive me for how quickly people die from my creation
I’m debating whether or not to withhold the only cure
Kill more people than the evils of the World and Holy War

[Interlude: Q-Unique]
An estimated 5 million new HIV infections occured worldwide during 2003, that's 14 thousand infections each and every day
950 thousand US residents are living with HIV and AIDS, 25% are unaware they are infected

1975 they created AIDS inside a laboratory!

[Verse 2: Sabac]
Taught to implement disaster, take something used a lot
Proof I got started with the common use of booster shots
Those who not believe, this disease will damage the completion
Of immune system [?]
See me leak and discharge, got you speaking mish mash
This God's way of teaching demon's not to lean in his arms
Sexual behavior plays a major role in your survival
I will give you what you get when you disrespect The Bible
I'll do anything to kill the fags, niggers and [?]
[???]
Sick for life is the effect
Nothing can find to protect you
There's no stop for what I'm plotting
What I'm pumping might infect you

[Interlude: Q-Unique]
In 2003, approximately 6 thousand non-adults became infected with HIV
Approximately 40 thousand new HIV infections  occured in the United States
Half of those infected people are younger than 25 years old

1975 they created AIDS inside a laboratory!

[Verse 3: Sabac]
I'm leaking lethal sin, people dying out at rapid rate
My tactic straight, my teach is [?] to preserve the master race
Caskets wait to be filled by the patients it kills
Fool you will think you be cured by taking some pills
Affecting the world, even the people you watch on TV
The Liberaces, Freddy Mercuries and Eazy-Es
It's to lead world panic, my antics are so climatic, synthetic CD for [?] dramatic
Man, you can't combat it
Taxes increase, [?] and come with answers
Bring the message, self awareness, but people are dumb and careless
Fail as ones, be infected in the time that least expecting
Neglecting the truth leaves you [?]
Nothing support denial [?] in your brain leave you believing for some reason that this disease is contained
Death toll is far from retro, don't think it won't affect you
Which is peeking, so keep sleeping and then one day come and get you

[Outro: Q-Unique]
As for December 31st, 2002 an estimated 501,669 in the United States had died

1975 they created AIDS inside a laboratory!
