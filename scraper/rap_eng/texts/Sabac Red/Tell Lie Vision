[Intro]
I want the young motherfuckers in here tonight
No matter what your nationality is
Turn the motherfucking TV off for one week
And see if you can survive


[Verse 1]

Click, Click
You've been brought in to the tube
The message gets projected that alters your mood
An infectious deathwish right in front of your face
Glorification of tanks, bombs, guns and grenades
Call of Duty: Black Opses, military control
Not the game but how they engauge you to enroll
Reality shows influence hatin' the boss
Contradicting programs, food challenge, weight loss
Exploitation of blacks, fights posted on the Internet
Binary codes now promote smoking cigarettes
Trick-knowledgy but the knowledge is trick
So you buy bigger things to compromise for your dick
Plastic surgeons, fake tits, strips to racist themes
Sex addiction, cocaine, we host a place for fiends
Sixteen pregnant gang wars, rapists and crime
Lose control, die, LCD raping our minds

[Verse 2]

It's a media brain trap
We became slaves to the screen
Corporations run stations on the station we see
Odd attention into poverty, the threat in economy
The pressure of providing with the message of autonomy
Suicide, murder, drug dealing police
Pill poppers, prostitutes, what's real in the streets
It's the beef, the conflict, the overload of aggression
It's the power struggle leading to the mode of depression
We love the entertainment when the cameras go up
Millionaire aspirations in the bad girls club
Cops 'n' robbers, mobsters, we're stable for days
Can't afford a decent meal but the cable is paid
It's more than Big Brother, this is brain control
Deleted emails are saved on a station in Rome
The Kinect for Xbox scans your body for heat
It sends rays through your brain til your body's diseased

[Outro]
It's called "tell a vision" programming
They tellin' you visions being programmed. You bein' programmed
You watch it on the news, 'It was on CNN, it's true. I seen it on FOX, it's real.' It's BULLSHIT!
