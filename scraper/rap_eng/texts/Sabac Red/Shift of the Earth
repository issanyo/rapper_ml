[Chorus]
A final warning, a shift of the Earth
Global warming, it's gonna get worse
A fast food nation will shatter your soul
The vast population is out of control

[Verse 1]
This ain't some tree hugging bullshit, homie I'm hood
Express my thoughts on a subject like only I could
We didn't learn from war, media and terror
My concerns on .... I could be breathing clever
Look how the seasons change, rainfall and heat
Mudslides, cyclones, [?]
... tornadoes ... volcanoes
