[Chorus]

Yo it’s the ritual, the body, mind, the physical is visible
The spiritual’s invisible
The visual, practice patterns based on vision through the ritual
Unpredictable, you sitting through the ritual

The body, mind, the physical is visible
The spiritual’s invisible
The visual, practice patterns based on vision through the ritual
Unpredictable

[Verse 1]

Escape the afterlife, we in the days of sacred sacrifice
Ceremony rituals conducted by a cast of light
Past heights of Heaven, most are in Hell or alone
I channel ? for the angelical stone
Delve in the zone, my vision ? shadows
I follow the sons of light, existence covet by the pharaohs
Blood on arrows, crossbows, flesh of the wicked
Put to death ? life oppressed or convicted
Possessed by the sickness, message from the wickeds
Conflicted and restricted, America’s a business
Terrorists flipped it, not condoning their actions
But they got us on our toes, now we know what can happen
Imagine if we could prevent every tragic event
Not by war but what we saw from using magic instead
It’s a blast to the head to all lost in the promise
The fast of the dead and a cultured conscious

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

Some say I’m wise beyond my years, I feel I’m years beyond wisdom
I find a ? after all these years I’m not behind prison
Seek dependence and friendships, my amendments are endless
Taking risks has been the gist of how legends remain remembered
Not pretentious, I’m honest, try to defend us I promise
Cause only trust can hold just with these offenders upon us
Too many leaders are speechless, too many cowards in power
A weakness that’ll beat us, smoky clouds in the towers
I speak the loudest and proudest debating hatred and evil
The greatest rage we are equal engage the faces of evil
I take my faith like I ? and die for cause or rebellion
Call it the laws of a felon, it’s more assault that I’m selling
Give me applause when I’m yelling and bleeding, beating my chest
Screaming freedom or death, defeating beasts of the flesh
Only sleep when I rest, wake up to balance the pressure
A talent that can be measured on how much ? oppress us

[Chorus]
