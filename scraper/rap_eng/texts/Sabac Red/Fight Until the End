[Hook]
Dem shoot at us, turn around and deny it
People on the streets are dyin'
We must come together
Fight oppression and pull de pressure
On de system that tries to diss us
Tries to hurt us, and tries to kill us
We don't win, we fight again
We gon' fight until the end, until the end
We fight until we win, until we win

[Verse 1: Sabac]
Unjustified shootings, fatal chokings, severe beatings
Police attack the innocent without fair reason
Precincts are full of cowards abusin' authority
Minorities abuse majority, people livin' in poverty
Priority is them doin' right by the nation
But large parts of it's been human rights violation
Tired of being patient waitin' for internal affairs
To show improvements, the truth is we been burnin' for years
Use your weapons, fight back, kid, that's how the game goes
My boy Kevin got his skull cracked by pigs in plain clothes
They told him there's regrets if he doesn't stay calm
And proceeded to put cigarettes out in his palm
Now he can't think, he can't feel
Sometimes you gotta grab steel, blast, peal
Before they sentence you and serve your last meal
I know fightin' back is easier said than actin'
Let's start movin' forward and stop steppin' backwards

[Hook]
Dem shoot at us, turn around and deny it
People on the streets are dyin'
We must come together
Fight oppression and pull de pressure
On de system that tries to diss us
Tries to hurt us, and tries to kill us
We don't win, we fight again
We gon' fight until the end, until the end
We fight until we win, until we win

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
On the day me and Sabac Red drop dead
Knocked by the feds, or get shot with a Glock in the head
Like the Bloods on the corner, the block'll be red
And like the passion of Christ, there'll be a lot to be said
Fuck a protest in the street with all of my peeps
My soul will never let a crooked cop's family sleep
And you'll never find peace, even in retirement
Like I'ma do to all y'all cops that turned into firemen
I'll keep your children lyin' in a sleepin' hypnosis
Nightmares about drownin' in a ocean of roaches
Molested by dead bodies full of worms and locousts
But the insects are nothin' when the judgement approaches
Call my spirit the coldest, you say that I'm bitter
But I'm sick of cops callin' me a spic and a nigga
And you pigs probably won't get the message I write you
'Cause the industry is racist motherfuckers just like you

[Hook]
Dem shoot at us, turn around and deny it
People on the streets are dyin'
We must come together
Fight oppression and pull de pressure
On de system that tries to diss us
Tries to hurt us, and tries to kill us
We don't win, we fight again
We gon' fight until the end

[Verse 3: Sabac]
Not everyone is built for war when it comes to cops and
Fear plays a part, so I'll inform you of your options
Get the names and badges of cops from the precinct
Show your face in the street so police know you decent
Keep them on their toes, take flicks and videos
Impose injustices, 'cause them clips can be gold
Hold a coalition in your building, a new movement
Raise cash, start a civilian-review unit
Be aware of wrong-doings, inform your whole alliance
Write the senator to put a end to the code of silence
Let's unite, fight back, know our rights, watch the government
Apply better laws, and enforce harsher punishment
For pigs who beat kids for no apparent reason
We acted on the defense while battlin' the precinct
If the system won't respond to your truth and facts
Bear arms, they've been warned, retaliate, and shoot back

[Hook]
Dem shoot at us, turn around and deny it
People on the streets are dyin'
We must come together
Fight oppression and pull de pressure
On de system that tries to diss us
Tries to hurt us, and tries to kill us
We don't win, we fight again
We gon' fight until the end, until the end
We fight until we win, until we win
