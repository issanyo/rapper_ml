[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Had the time of his life, a capitalist with a communist wife
Started to fight and did to cats what God did to Christ
Hardly the type to give garbage advice
He was larger than life
He'd penetrate the roof of your car with a spike
Trained by an insane ex-marine CIA traitor renegade assassin android
Passed deployed piloting black helicopter choppers over Bosnia
Sniffing so much coke nose was fucked up and bled a lot
For all y'all bystanders baggy ass jeans to hide ya banga rangas
Thugged the fuck out hang with bash-in-ya-face-gat-gangsta
The government's these other kids is like the drunken bitch
That sucked a hundred dicks at your party and cried rape
Plus the hooker lies great, sniff another line to get ya mind straight
Pull out the nine and start shooting people
Money ain't the root of evil it be much more than that
America taught me how to kidnap and torture cats

[Chorus: Ill bill]
Exit the stargate, initial perception quickens my heart rate
This dark place planet Earth orbits one star
I've come from afar far away state of mind
Open up your third eye black helicopters in the sky
Exit the stargate, initial perception quickens my heart rate
This dark place planet Earth orbits one star
I've come from afar far away state of mind
Open up your third eye black helicopters in the sky

[Verse 2: Goretex]
I need G's so I can jet easier, my crib's tapped
I suspect Ether, that's why I'm out of touch with the media
Undercovers like Pete Seiger, I couldn't tell neither
Watchin' the projects with a van of speakers
Peepin' how my kids rest, bangin' my wiz for hours
Surveillance tapes pissin' in King's Plaza even got us after hours
Drug parties, golden showers on the poor shiksa
Work for the FBI so anytime I might whisper
My scary team be like barely clean, rockin' Israeli jeans
That's why I mostly heard and rarely seen
Realization soaked in urgency
Can't escape history's pen I be the worst of me

[Chorus: Ill bill]
Exit the stargate, initial perception quickens my heart rate
This dark place planet Earth orbits one star
I've come from afar far away state of mind
Open up your third eye black helicopters in the sky
Exit the stargate, initial perception quickens my heart rate
This dark place planet Earth orbits one star
I've come from afar far away state of mind
Open up your third eye black helicopters in the sky

[Verse 3: Sabac Red]
This cop bring the city hoppa like a rocka with binoculars
Took me and these two rastas and a mobster cat for hostage
Said that we were imposters and inpatient government agent
From another nation and said we had the proper information
About the aliens, vegetarians, devils, and Aryans
These are civilized Barbarians, we'll fuckin' bury them
The Rasta said 'you pussy blood clot' got you shot
I'm like fuck this I'm blowin' up spots cause shit is hot
We know about the plan to fill the projects and contraband
Drop bombs on Brazil so you can kill and conquer land
Your drug trafficking, your new creation for disease
To control the population and in the states and overseas
Put poison in the weed and the milk we feed our seeds
You looked shocked that Sabac could know the plots to all of these
Took his Glock licked a shot when the bastard wasn't lookin'
Threw him out then the mobster flew the chopper back to Brooklyn

[Chorus: Ill bill]
Exit the stargate, initial perception quickens my heart rate
This dark place planet Earth orbits one star
I've come from afar far away state of mind
Open up your third eye black helicopters in the sky
Exit the stargate, initial perception quickens my heart rate
This dark place planet Earth orbits one star
I've come from afar far away state of mind
Open up your third eye black helicopters in the sky
