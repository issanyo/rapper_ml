[Intro: Sabac Red]

Life and death, people come and go, it’s part of our destiny

[Verse 1: Sabac Red]

You ever have someone you care about just leave your life?
Whether sudden or it’s coming and you can’t breathe right
The first time I was ten when I endured that pain
My friend’s dad was shot in front of my face, I saw brains
She was nine, she was crushed, she was mine, I had a crush
Then she moved out of state, her moms abandoned her
I knew this kid in middle school who refused to make friends
Cause his dad was military, they’d be moving again
It’s the passing of a grandparent, mom, or dad
Or a child, take advantage of the times we have
It’s divorce, it’s death, it’s the loss, regrets
But for every loss we find something more to connect
There’s a plan though we don’t always know what it is
Like my friend who got married but wifey couldn’t have kids
Then his mom passed away, we were stunned and torn
Nine months later their son was born

[Hook: Sabac Red/Jordan Battiste]

This is our destiny, what is meant to be will be
It’s out of our hands, part of the plan
Respect time we have, enjoy the show
Because people come and go
And when they go they’re missed
Whether old or kids
It’s the memories we make, it’s that ownership
It’s the unknown fear, it’s the fear we know
When our people come and go

[Verse 2: Slaine]

We’re trapped in a race against time
I guess that some of us are running slower
You never know when the Grim Reaper might be coming over
A boy watch his older brother go become a soldier
Die overseas, now he barely sees his mother sober
His father left her, he don’t know if he should love or loathe her
He wishes pops would just show up with a dozen roses
Him and cousin Joseph jumping on the fucking sofas
Screaming out the window at the city while they’re chugging sodas
Laughing, not fully grasping or grappling with truth
Smoking grass, hanging on the corner tackling their youth
Absentee parents and violence is everywhere
Chaos and loss surround them but their eyes never tear
They share private stock, bitches, Hennessy, fistfights and enemies
They share the same pain, same blood, and same memories
They was everything that was clear but wasn’t said
Till he shows up at the crib and finds his cousin dead

[Hook]
