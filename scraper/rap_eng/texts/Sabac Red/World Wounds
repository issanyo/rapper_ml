*Open up their eyes and see through the lies*

[Verse 1: Sabac Red]
Yo
This world is full of lies and deception
Facilities and correction, the expectations are expecting
Consumption and pain, mind ulterior game
The presumption of fame until you bury your frame
Got a scope on the luger, see hope for the future
The soul will [?] ya like the vocals of Luther
Pursuit of happiness results in a bitter end
Find the ambition grace the face of a kid again
Time for transitioning, face of oblivion
Confined by restrictions based on the dividend
These days we're living in are unbalanced and rushed
Challenging us to become the [?]
We damage your trust, we move among the panic and lust
After things we can't touch bring out the [?]
Addicted, now we search for the fastest of buzz
It's what it was until we are all turned to ashes and dust, what

[Hook]
Swarming unpredictably, we spread terror
[?]
Read between the lines, see what I see
There's a demon in ya hood
Proceed with caution

Swarming unpredictably, we spread terror
[?]
Read between the lines, see what I see
Tighter than the flash from the click

[Verse 2: Trademarc]
All these ulterior motives, I just can't handle
Got us lightning [?] candles
For every little break in trust, freedom's taken from us
We on the cusp of a military stage of the [?] wage
While our presidents act like Hitler with American taste
I'm so caught up in Covert Affairs
Independent media outlets are brought up in fear
So no news is currently fair
We liable to, [?] the hunts, our rivals are hung
By Blackwater militaries privately run, they're riding with guns
It's like a rerun of SS soldiers hunting down jews in the ghettos
But this time it's class warfare in American meadows
With the National Debt, they tax paychecks so we'll never make enough te be a threat
Stars and stripes are more swastikas, bars and pipes, in America's Fourth Reich
I can [?] dictator with his best [?], rounding up more Americans than his [?]


[Hook]
Swarming unpredictably, we spread terror
[?]
Read between the lines, see what I see
There's a demon in ya hood
Proceed with caution

Swarming unpredictably, we spread terror
[?]
Read between the lines, see what I see
Open up their eyes and see through the lies

[Verse 2: I.Sheik]
Motherfuckers plant seeds of corruption, bleed from the fact
That greed lead the world into economic collapse
And Barack ain't immune it steadies part of the act
While the blocks is consumed these devils counting their checks
And the darkness that looms in hearts of [?]
With [?] screams and shouts the flag [?] amounts
Stuff the barrel in their mouth, call 'em out
That's what the AK and [?] barcode is all about
Now my name, [?] congressional ranks
Modern day [?] up in the federal banks
Another sound decision, the States all [?] overcrowding prisons and corporations bought in
Read a secret, communicated tailing the plot
Hopped the train down to Wall Street and emptied the Glock
Now answer me this, what the fuck is conscious rap?
Unless your eyes stay open and your race stay trapped

[Hook]
Swarming unpredictably, we spread terror
[?]
Read between the lines, see what I see
Tighter than the flash from the click

Swarming unpredictably, we spread terror
[?]
Read between the lines, see what I see
Open up their eyes and see through the lies

[Outro: DC The MIDI Alien & I.Sheik]
*Avengers Radio, we still here, calling you on the air what's good?*
*Yo DC what up man? Peace I.Sheik from [?]*
*Yo word up Sheik, Revolution of the Mind, my West Coast Avengers. Ayo what's going down on the left coast man?*
*Yo man shit is crazy as hell out here man. We live here marching out on the streets, trying to bring justice these crooked ass cops. They murdered the homie Oscar Grant, shot the brother in cold blood while he was laying face down on the fucking ground. We was marching south [?], peacefully out on the streets and these fucking riot police started flipping on us man. With [?] and tear gas and the whole [?]. You know we couldn't lay down for that shit so we started firing back. Shit started going crazy man, it's an all-out warfare in broad fucking daylight*
*Yo that's unbelievable to me man. Rest In Peace to Oscar Grant. I can't believe the national media hasn't really covered that more in depth*
*Yeah but you know what though? It ain't nothing but a thing out here on the West Coast man. This is history repeating itself.  This is Watts in '65, this is L.A. in '91, this is Upton in '09. 2010 we doing the shit all over again and when this shit is done we gone round up all the Latino brothers and sisters and roll out to Arizona, ride on those racist fucking rednecks too. This is C.A. where the movement never motherfucking [?]*
*Hey word up Sheik, I got just the track for you man. This next joint is called Riot Gear. It features my man Termanology, Singapore Kane and Big Shug. Big shout out to the homie Dfi. Avengers Radio, hijack radio. Keep it live.*
