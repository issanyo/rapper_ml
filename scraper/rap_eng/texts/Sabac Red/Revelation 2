[Jamal Joseph:]
I wish I had a revelation
Something deep and clear
Wisdom that flows like the Nile through deserts of opression
But our children are dying in the streets
Babies being raped by a glass coffin that vomits a death smoke called crack
People are still starving in Africa despite the records and videos that say how much we care
King Bush the Second is crazier than ever and the next bomb you hear
May be your home, while the wild dressed brothers uptown
Worried about stock market and the bad news downtown
Like it really matters to us
I wish I had a revelation
Something powerful and raw
Strength that burns like fire in a manner that defies all weakness, like
Chaka Zulu's conquest or, [?] victories but our children are dying in the streets
Ravaged by a plague called AIDS
