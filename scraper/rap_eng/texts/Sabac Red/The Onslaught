[Verse 1: Planetary]
My minds racing at the speed of life
My emotions run deep into the sea
You can't breath on mics
Like twenty-thousand leagues under the seas
Hunger, disease, thunder, I.V.'s till I bleed thunder
In a coma till the needles pour Coronas
When I'm equal to the soul or yet evil when I roll up
On my off days, I call phase then we spar in a cage
Fight with words while we brawl on a page
We the craziest, nigga you can call us rap saviors
Pharaohs with a tongue sharp, slicing through your radius
Perfect, precision of a Shanghai knight
Fight battles, scream victory, hang my mic
It's a blessing, holy water splash from a reverend
Blast through your congregation, you're too feminine
Walk into our halls of medicine
When they let us in, you better not sleep
We on the creep, it's done again

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
I'm from the Village of the Damned
With two buckets of blood in my hand
I had money back when Betho was fucking with Cam
I used to use the nine, Taurus, but fuck it, it jammed
I used to be in rhyme wars with the roughest of men
I'm destructive with hands, nice with the shotty
You can meet the coroner, ice on the body
I don't play no more, life is a Hell
Kill the king daddy, knife in the Citadel
You can get it however you want it little crumb
I could leave the microphone bloody, cripple drums
I'm the fucking warlord, blood stained floor
I'm the opposite off pure, drugs, pain, war
I'm the reason why you wake in your sleep
The reason everybody scared to have a race on the beat
They facing defeat, Vinnie P amazing with heat
Knife in they back with they fucking face in the creek
Faggot

[Hook: Sabac Red]
There's something 'bout the way we rock
That got the crowd going wild every time we come and blow the spot
Man, there's something 'bout the way we spit
That got niggas in the streets in they whips tryna play these hits

There's something 'bout the way we rock
That got the crowd in the marsh every time we come and blow the spot
Man, there's something 'bout the way we spit
That got niggas in the hood in they whips tryna play these hits

[Verse 3: Sabac Red]
I speak in world accent, live life without limits
All about action, most y'all about gimmicks
And y'all finished, I can see the mirage
Y'all be acting devilish, but still be speaking to god
I'm reaching the stars, my mind is off to Egypt
Sabac is agnostics, so walk with Jesus
My thoughts are thesis, y'all talk facetious
Bitch motherfuckers rip you all to pieces
You often beasted, we Portericains
Sicilian motherfuckers who will toss you beatings
Unique individuals creeping with criminals
War is so blatant and peace is subliminal
I'm killing you in principal, no ones invincible
Think it through, what the fuck you think guns was meant to do?
I sentence you to a life of torture and pain
Half these bitch motherfuckers don't belong in this game

[Verse 4: King Syze]
Ringing the alarm, swearing that you killing the song
Real murderers killing the foundation your shit was built on
Lets get it on, Syze stand in militant form
My militia is raw, plus I'm lyrically gifted with bars
You pissing me off, the shit you spitting is soft
While you sitting at bars, I'm getting lifted with god
Explain it, tryna be a star, more like you did behind bars
Especially the recipe is an exceptional squad
So my music ain't deep rooted, it's more like deep hearted
So I make a promise of recrohonours, so death rule is upon us
Man, my squad are bombers on the track, harmony style
The army Non Phixion, man we probably wild
The godliest styles, don't think about outing us
We'll turn you into powder puffs, who the fuck is doubting us? The cops locking us, ain't no holding us there
Kings Syze, Sabac, Planetary, Vinnie Paz
What?

There's something 'bout the way we rock

Man, there's something 'bout the way we spit
