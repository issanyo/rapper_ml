[Intro with Uncle Howie and ILL Bill]
What is the most important thing in-in Uncle Howie's life?
Drugs... drugs and music

[Hook x4]
My drug music, therapeutic to the user
Non Phixion - slam dance to it

[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
Y'all Valley of the Dolls, Married To The Mob
Fuck Carrie at the proms sabotage your God with the kronz
Call my dusk wildin, the rap Dennis Hopper, Black Helicopters
Smash the teleprompter, blast in front the Black Sabbath concert
First row hospital nurse blow
Life is good in the hood and when I skis, it snows
Portable hard drugs, auto-shotguns, we got thugs
Get my cock sucked by rock groupies and pop sluts
Weird chicks with big titties and pierced clits
Exotic dancers in love with Bill, the fuck you think?
Catch me at the bar tripping off of drugs and drinks
Bloods and Crips, coke dealers, thugs and pimps
Under the influence of things, I bring the drug music
To shooting you up with dope, beautifully composed narcotics
It's diabolical, you're like a crackhead prostitute
Without the loot, witness the music that's responsible

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2: Sabac Red]
I'm fighting a war inside my mind
The more I've lost, the more I find
The mortified towards the skies, open wide, rain warm
We leave your brain torn, brainstorm, till the pain gone
We gonna unify the streets against the beast, so get your gang on
Hang on for life OD, relevant drugs
Heroin buzz, my team some intelligent thugs
Y'all fear emotion, my crew pack the dance floor
Like dance more, me and my man's whore, slap y'all like handball
It's like a jungle sometimes, we life in gangland
Brooklyn, criminals, thieves, thugs and hoodlums
Cats'll pull they gun out, take over your drug route
Then blow off your legs and feet and order you to run out
I'm in a three piece on the streets like peace peace
But got guns for you cats who wanna see a ceased beef
I don't breathe right, my life don't seem right
I don't sleep nights, and won't till my whole family eats right

[Hook x4]

I cop this Buick with the seats pulled out in the back ways
I keep an ugly pack of villains like killers at craps games
Some are religious fasters, some are hype, some others blasters
Some are dead or in-jail fathers or young bastards
I pump the drug music, abuse beats, I been through it
SP's and MPC's, OZ's and QP's
Coke rocks to M3's, get yours to VP's
Work our way up, we don't give a fuck who gets stuck
Getcha ate up, we saw the world laying the cut
I could a went to college, stayed in bed with drug scholars
Praying for bricks, fancy whips, plants and kicks
Exotic chicks, tongue pierced play with the pussy clits
Like click-click, the paparazzi tripping off six
Ripping off kids, the shorty cat who whips with the clip
Like I'm in Vegas with a trunk of coke
Up in your projects and you never know I'm selling soap, smelling the dope
Hold the pope in Brooklyn, Howie took his wallet plus his laptop
Jumped in the whip, skidded to the nearest crack spot

[Hook x4]
