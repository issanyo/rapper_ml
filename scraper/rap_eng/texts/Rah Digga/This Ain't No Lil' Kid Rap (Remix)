[Intro: Rah Digga] (Redman)
(Yessirrrrr~!)
Ev'rybody grown in here right?! (Rated M for mature bitches)
I'm sayin we got the King and Queen of Brick City up in this piece
(I'm grown as a mu'fucker!!!!)
I be seein y'all talkin shit about people too old to rap (NAH!!!)
Fuck outta here!!! What you mean too old to rap?! (Well let's get it then!)
I'll bust all y'all asses, quit playin with me!
Actin like you don't know! (Let's GO!)

[Verse One: Rah Digga]
SHIT!!!! Comin with that grown folk I ain't tryin to pick a fight
But this ain't a Fisher Price Kidz Bop Nick At Nite
This that Adult Swim rise by the gigabyte
No disrespect but I don't take you for the spittin type
You ain't got no ends in mi casa
I can get smooth Frank Sinatra or spank them in patois
Your girl Rah Rah I do this for a hobby
Whole crowd waitin for my shit, porta-potties
Them bars spill y'all ain't shocked as hell
I tell these retailers y'all better stock the shelves
These hoes be trippin on "Tightropes," not Janelle's
"Make Music with my Mouth" like Biz or Rahzel
Next to me y'all Mattel  I'm Shells and Gazelles
It's News Chopper 12 when I rock the bells
Pass Doctor L commits to ass whoopin
Get the belt on these scabs I catch their ass lookin

[Chorus: Rah Digga]
HUH! This ain't no lil' kid rap here
UH UH! This ain't no lil' kid rap here
SHIEEETTTTT!!! This that grown folks music
Homey think he fresh tell tell that motherfucker deuces
(STUPID) They say I'm what the game been missin
Tell 'em rhymes do matter but they ain't listnenin (THEY AIN'T LISTENIN)
Could spend a whole lifetime fishin
Won't find another better on this write rhyme mission

[Verse Two: Redman]
YO, I hope no kids up in here, I'm exclusive
That's why them hoes +Hawkin+ me like Yusef {*WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF*}
Haters gon' hate, 'cause they chick on the rooster
SHORTY! I think your car seat need a booster
Drug abuser, Bricks, that's where the bass at
Out of town niggas, pay tax A.S.A.P
Verse for your Maybach, pockets on lypo
YEAAAAAAH!!! "This is It" like Michael
Drop E'RRY month like your me-nstrual cycle
I'm wide open sayin, "Rappers, I don't like 'em"
Tyson in his prime, Louis on Vuitton
And you never work like the project intercom
(NOOPE!) And that's why I'm a grown man, boy!
24 inch ashtray and Altoids
NEVER gettin dressed for the Soul Train Awards
I'm out there, next door to Elroy
BEYOTCH~!

[Chorus: Rah Digga]
HUH! This ain't no lil' kid rap here
UH UH! This ain't no lil' kid rap here
SHHHHHH!!!! This that Brick City ish
And we ain't into beef in all that little kiddie ish
They say I'm what the game been missin
Tell 'em rhymes do matter but they ain't listnenin (THEY AIN'T LISTENIN)
Could spend a whole lifetime fishin
Won't find another better on this write rhyme mission

[Bridge: Rah Digga]
They say I'm what the game been missin (I mean, they keep callin me!)
They say I'm what the game been missin (I been chillin)
They say I'm what the game been missin
Rappers sayin they are the best, but they ain't spittin (Bloggin me...)
They say I'm what the game been missin (Textin me...)
They say I'm what the game been missin
They say I'm what the game been missin
Real lyricist eveytime my name is mentioned

[Outro: Rah Digga]
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!!!!!!

[Redman]
Gillahouse, Rah Digga, what's good?!
