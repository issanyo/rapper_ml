[Rah Digga]
Rah Digga, P!nk
Let's go, ladies
Do it

You don't want it baby (tell me why, tell, tell me why)
You don't want it baby (tell me why, tell, tell me why)
You don't want it baby (tell me why, tell, tell me why)
Baby, baby, (tell, tell me why, tell, tell me why)

You don't want it baby (tell me why, tell, tell me why)
You don't want it baby (tell me why, tell, tell me why)
You don't want it baby (tell me why, tell, tell me why)
Baby, baby, (tell, tell me why, tell, tell me why)


[Verse 1 - Rah Digga]
Put it on, what went wrong, something's happening to my brain
Something strange, can't explain since I got up in this game
Think I'm bugging, call me rugged, this before I had my name
People fussing, brand new cousins, 'nough to drive a bitch insane
Tell me why do I sacrifice my family and my friends
Thought the struggle would be over, finding out it just begins
Call me crazy, leave my baby, and be traveling on my way
Round the clock, making stops to make somebody else's day


[Hook - P!nk]
I found myself stressing over ignorant things
I had to realize all the hate that negativity brings
It's like wherever the day takes me now
Can't be that perfect girl, I don't even know how


[Verse 2 - Rah Digga]
Put it on, what went wrong, something's happening around the way
Watching roots and hip hop culture breaking down from day to day
Tell me why, where's the love, all the turbulence and crime
Tryin' to teach my cousins, Frankly, cause we running out of time
The government done found themselves the perfect remedy
Three strikes, give them life, and give the rest immunity
Wanna cry, tell me why, is all these babies in the street
Little girls is barely teens, and they done had more sex than me


[Hook - P!nk]
I found myself stressing over ignorant things
I had to realize all the hate that negativity brings
It's like wherever the day takes me now
Can't be that perfect girl, I don't even know how


[Verse 3 - Rah Digga]
Now now now
Don't even know how I'm supposed to be
Motivated by the love of those close to me
While I'm steady on the west, trying to make my ends
Turning friends to enemies, and enemies to friends
Every lesson I've learned, try my best just to show you
Acting like I owe you and I don't even know you
Before it get better, I see it getting worse
So before the struggle do me
Holla do me first


[Bridge - P!nk]
Look, thank you LaFace, and I feel so out of place
It's like constant confusion, and I always feel like I'm losing
Something telling me to be strong, something's telling me to go on
Sayin' P!nk, come now let's do this song
Rah Dig', and it's going on


[Hook - P!nk]
I found myself stressing over ignorant things
I had to realize all the hate that negativity brings
It's like wherever the day takes me now
Can't be that perfect girl, I don't even know how


[Rah Digga] (x2)
You don't want it baby (tell me why, tell, tell me why)
You don't want it baby (tell me why, tell, tell me why)
You don't want it baby (tell me why, tell, tell me why)
Baby, baby, (tell, tell me why, tell, tell me why)
