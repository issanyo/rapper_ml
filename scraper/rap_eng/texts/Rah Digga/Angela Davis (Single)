(Lyrics in 16 bars)

Intro:

Leader of the resistance
And it's only for the thick skin
Runnin' round in chick-lands circuit with my Bricks-man
When it come to spittin', got that sixth sense

And I don't think they know the difference
And I'm getting at my wit's end
And then that real rap kicked in
And they wonder how it missed them

Verse 1:

I'm Angela Davis, I ain't shaking my buns
I'm yelling power to the people and waving 'em guns
I be pumping dat fist, I ain't running some shit
It ain't too many o' you broads got the stomach for dis!

Y'all worry 'bout your stylist, worry 'bout your talents
Build up your valence, expandin' your palettes
Better find you a balance else that homegoing won't be
As turned up as Howard's

Verse 2:

Ha! Call me Angela Davis
In my all black floating through the Matrix
They like, “Digga, can you save us?”
When did lyricism escape us?

You one of the few that kept it raw through the ages
You ‘bout the culture even more than the papers
And you ain't have to do that fake shit
I love my black features, I ain't tryna get no facelifts

Verse 3:

I'm Angela Davis, no perm
Momma had that straightin’ comb on slow burn
They ‘on't know about ME, but they gon' learn!
They gon' learn!!

How I had the infallible Lauryn Hill lighting roaches on the mic
Told Kim we read' enough, we not doing ladies night
Told Rage we success, we gon' be Nas and Jay
And the duets with Bust’, still his best to this day

Chorus:

I'm Angela Davis, I ain't, y’all say
Couple war scar flaws from my young day
Album ain’t debut number one, two or three
But I showed you how to be an emcee

Call me Angela Davis, I'm steppin' with pride
Y'all condone the coonin’, I ain't lettin' it ride
Y'all so foo-foo, even the who's who
I swear to God they ‘on't make 'em like they used to

I'm Angela Davis!

Outro:

KRS One (Sample):
I freed myself but I'm coming back to free my brothers and sisters
That ain't for everybody
You gotta be ordained
I wouldn’t put that mission on nobody
