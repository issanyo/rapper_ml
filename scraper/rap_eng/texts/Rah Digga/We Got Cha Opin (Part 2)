(Rah-Digga)
I be the worst nightmare To all them mc thugs
Like them 4 little kids And the teacher gettin plugged
I don't give a fuck style Tell me come jiggy
I rock kix and swishees Coppin moet wit 2 counterfeit 50's
What? Dirty girl rhyme spit mucous Speech uncoothe
And raise the roof like Lukas
12 years done rocked through all phases
Watch your peeps scream the bitch was the blazest

[Spliff Starr]
Niggas run they mouth about my click Not smart
I bust your bloodclot Then drop you upon the sidewalk
(Chi-chi-chi-Blow!!!) Hit ya ass wit a vicious blow
You know my style Spliff the foul Through your stereo
Spliff Starr ignorant immigrant I'm gettin it
Money, fast car, fine broads, what I'm hittin it (that's right)
Raw shit I'm spittin it At you and yours
Make you feel the pain nigga Like the dick to your balls
Thug blood fluid Pumpin in the face of my music
Drop the street shit Watch the whole world rock to it
Nigga Squad!!!

[Baby Sham]

[Rampage]

Don't front, my squad got you opin
Hit you with a buck fifty
Here's a token
Ramp is smokin
I'm no joke and
I leave your face broken
This is survival of the fittest
Get wit us
All you critics and bullshitters
My nine goes bang
I'm talkin street slang
I'm reppin Flipmode
Plus I'm doing my thang
On the side
We won't let it ride
Nigga don't hide

[Lord Have Mercy]
Landlord innovator
Switch lanes no indicator
The general, cash generator
Master and saviour
Nigga stay massive in nature
When tooth shatter ya die bone
In the savage cyclone of cops, sirens, and cases
Who read the bible for basics?
When I'm crooked eye with rivals
Horizontal in God's places
Suspicious of all
Now who dat???
Quick on the draw
Lick a paw
For loved ones blood runs cold in the winter wars
Check the criminal thoughts
Villains warp with the invisible force
Know the ledge
Stay focused like photo lens
And spread wings like Cobra heads
Till I'm old and dead

[Busta Rhymes]
Hot shit, toxic
You know we blocks shit
Traffic in the streets system
All in your jeep knocks shit
Julio for no reason back the fifth
And he cocks it
Rock shit, we make niggas mad
And wanna pop shit
Massive and attractive
Niggas is captive
Chemotherapy needed
Lyrics radioactive
When I hit hard
It get my dick hard
In my backyard
Analyze the stars
On how to defeat all odds
In a new zone
I'm on a new phone
Make most of the wackest rapper niggas
Wanna find a new home
Like Rasco jeans
My style flip two-tone
Pass my blue chrome
Here's one of the best of Busta Rhymes own
My debut made you
Wonder who
Shit blazes so much
You wish you could play out
So you could blaze, too
Before I shout you
Or give reason to doubt you
I study shit and re-analyze everything about you
My rhymes on the preserve
Niggas know we deserve
Everything up in your stash and in the reserve
Fuck that!!!
Hook up all my lyrics on the echos and the re-verbs
Never fuck with these herbs
My squad remains superb

(Buckshot)
(Heh) Walkin thru the streets
Undercovers follow us, stress
Muthafuckas on the regular to bust
Trust us
We don't get enough
Nigga wha-what?
Dirty baggy jeans
Black napsack with something for ya gut
Wooly-type skully
Fully strapped, black bulletproof, and match
Quick
Whip up a batch
Of bullets to blow up the map
Shit
Collapse, perhaps doing this in the raps
In the long time, ya trapped
Buck make em react
God verse attack
Let em know the moon is still black
And it's a fact...

Don't front, you know we got cha opin, kid
Don't front, you know we got cha opin, kid
Don't front, you know we got cha opin, kid
Yo stop frontin, ya know we got cha opin
Don't front, you know we got cha opin, yo
Don't front, you know we got cha opin, kid
Don't front, you know we got cha opin, kid
Yo stop frontin, you know we got cha opin

Huh, word life

Mad niggas scopin
