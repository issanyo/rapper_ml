You heard ?
Yeah!
Guts is on the beats
It's crazy outta here
Digga
She's a girl digga digga
Now boom!
[?]
No time -
Let's get your life people

(Verse 1)
Hah! You say you love life
But life don't love you back
That's why is people in their twenties
Have a heart attacks
With no insurance no endurance
There's no cure for that
Problems we're facing
Can't be solved by any bureaucrat
Is more subliminal [yeah!]
That's more criminal [yeah!]
It's more obstacles
That keep you from your pinnacle
Look, kids used to know
That 'I Have A Dream' speech
All the things keen preach
Now they think that they're Big Meech
Yeah, but said it
Director is embedded [?]
The writings on my wall
But I guess we never read it
We're coming outta college
We're already in dead debt
Cash rules state of mind
And the world rammed by credit
It's hard to go to work
Much easier being junks [?]
Rich dad, poor dad
Guess we never read that book
They stopped in their frisking
Hope they let'em off the hook
Jail makes crooks better people
Or makes people better crooks?

(Refrain)
What's wrong with this world
That we're living at?
When I lead them in the streets [?]
They'd be killing them
What happens to my rights as a citizen?
Trust at the system ain't coincidence

(Verse 2)
Yo! If we're crowd gathered wit yo' -
Get lied on the ground
.44 rounds sampling the sound
Black and brown now
Another mother cry -
Who's gonna sing that lullaby?
Songs in [?] life
Even Stevie Wonder why?
Streets with a [?] cry
With another brother died
Spirits, screaming from the other side -
'Who's the next in line?'
