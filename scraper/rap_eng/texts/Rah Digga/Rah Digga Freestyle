(Rah Digga)
Yeah, Rah Digga!
Tony Touch got collabos baby
Flipmode Squad
Imperial!

Brick city in the house! Yeah that's what I'm talkin'
Let a bitch run her mouth! Yeah that's what I'm talkin'
For starters, I'm taking out most of MCs that you deal with
All at one time like little kids on a field trip
What about the others? Their brothers?
Best friends and yes-men? Digga got em covered
How you do that? By sptting rhymes by the mass
Living ghetto-fabulous like my man Rass Kass
World life, get no realler than muslims and silver
B-Girl stance in front the million dollar villa
Rise, bitches gon' rise
Nigga float 'fore you shit capsize
Record in stores
Worldwide tours
Niggas say female rappers either dikes or they're whore
I call them all crazy, bitches rule for sure
When the niggas in their clique ain't around no more

That's right baby, 50 MCs, Rah Digga in your face
Big shout out to Tony Touch baby, back in your face
Third round knockout
Outsidaz up in here
Young Zee, Pace Won, Eminem bout to have shit ill
B-e-g, getting checks from me, baby boy no raps for free
Flipmode is the Squad
9-8, Rah Digga, First and Only Female, I write my own rhymes
Rugged as they come
