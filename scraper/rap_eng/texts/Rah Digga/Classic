Aha, yeah, I know it's only one me*
Many of try
If I want to be the queen of the street
I'm just me, yeah
Classic, got that classic
I only forgot to try

And write the only thought of mine
... just trying to figure it out
It's so easy
Classic, I'm so nut to average
Hook for... from the...
Top gun not one that I'm see... I

Cropped in photoshop, they're not in my telephone
Who want to challenge, I'm on the way to,..

Flow low stop like,..

Let it... it

When the last time you asked why
They got me flow it in, pussy... all in it
Follow in the,.. survive...

Open that classic
Classic, all day classic
I'm dig it, classic
My dues told to...
Shut, shut them down

So classic, even my car it's historic

Telling them suck up their asses
About that bombastic, is digging in, in, pomp in that classic

[Chorus:]
Classic, open that classic
Dig it that classic
