[Intro]
Y'all must be out y'all muthafuckin' minds
It's the nigga in me (x4)
You must've bumped yo muthafuckin' head
It's the nigga in me (x4)
They gon' read it and weep
They wanna wake a sleepin' giant that ain't even asleep
Playin' w/ my 70s, and my PS3
I kept hearin' my name, I said let me see
"The bitch might be a nigga, for reala, she Rah Digga"

[Verse 1]
What the fuck man?
This guy, you barely caught a meal short of fish fry
Think I'm lettin' this fly, Fat Trel can kiss my
Global rap ass, he barely out of D.C
Tried to look him up, he ain't even got a wiki
On his records gettin' cheeky, tryna throw some shee shee
I'm right at the door, like when a dog's gotta pee pee
Some say it's beneath me, I should be the bigger artist
But this what happens when you get a nigga get started
The veterans, I love the referange
I love to talk slick, I love to reprimand
Dudes sayin' my name, I come like candy man
Made Nightmare on E Street, more like Candy land
Have them rhymes you be spittin', sound like Rhythm and Blues
Mel Gibson, what he did to them Jews
This Waka Flocka mixed with Choppa, done forgot what Rah Digga could do
Such a lady and I'm still more nigga than you

"You remind me of Rah Digga
A bitch rappin' like a nigga
Or was it a nigga rappin' like a bitch?!"

[Verse 2]
Y'all invoked that spirit, and them raw ass lyrics
From the only female too raw to compare it
To most of these rap dudes that claim they so street
I don't think I'm that rough, I think niggas too sweet
Soccer mom harder than y'all, man that's pitiful
Now I understand why rap is so ridiculed
Went up on twitter, and I found these jokers
Sits em on my next chapter, sit em down like Oprah
I'm like Yo Gabba Gabba, this no laughin' matter
This grown woman swagger, to you monkey rap bastards
Keep it in your own bracket, don't get too erratic
This Hunger Games shit, I use you for practice
Fuck is you creatin', son, a whole generation
Of some, hey horton, skateboardin', worshippin' satan asses
Bingin' on drugs, somebody get me the gloves
I don't think they need deals man, I think they need hugs
And I was trying to support this young black man
It's too bad you probably lost your only black fan
From now on, keep anointing ointment and ???
Take it any further, and you might catch a backhand

[Outro]
BITCH
See, you don't have to like me
You don't gotta listen to my shit
But you will respect me
Bitch!
