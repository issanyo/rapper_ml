Yeah, Rah Digga.. Flipmode, Outsidaz
Shit tight, down to the coochie
Yeah, check it

(And I) And I say what's tight
Cause a sista write rhymes all day and all night
Dwellin South of the Hudson, New Jerusalem
In seclusion, using fake pseudonyms (I'm true bad)
Mind travels like a skitzo on two tabs
With doo rags hangin from my pockets
(Me) Me, the rap bitch that goes back to pediatrics
Early left rappers like you were straight vexin (So)
So recognize, I make a nigga eyes come alive
Off of five two fives; disguise the camouflage
I shoot a virus out of my spirals with mad priors
For takin mad niggas titles!
Wetter than a resevoir; lurking in the bushes
Striking blows like Chesamar(?) code-name Hasana
Warmer than a bomber, hotter than the region of Ghana
Get loot like that Trump bitch, Ivana

(Chorus)
Now, who be writin rhymes all night
Rah Digga in tha house and plans is tight
(Tight) Peace to the ones that don't bite
Rah Digga in the house and my plans is tight

A black QUEEN, ya best believe my black jeans won't say Paco
I swing to the Vill' for some waffles and some beef falafel
Rap very tight liquor got me DIFFERENT
Dirtier than an overseas shipment of ki's
I write these TIGHT BUTTAS, creme de la GUTTAS
Call me Sheik Digga
Plotting over loops like the eight figures
Baby I'm hard, represent the feminist God
(What?) that gets blunted - watch rhymers runneth, over
See me in the camel Range Rover
(Chop) And I won't stop for Jake
And keep heat by the waist for those that playa hate
(NOW) Show you the way to blow, better than I tell you
Word to my beeper and my cellu-lar (What?) Polo curls
Diggin all the rapper's shit like they go-go girls

(Chorus)
WHO THE TIGHTEST? I rock with laryngitis
Gold's good for Midas, but I want the highest
So don't try me cause I be the bitch (I swear)
I'll leave you twisted like a thug with blonde hair
(Yeah) I blow up the spot like Dennis Scott
Go forward, your chance of defeatin me is morbid
Cuz I get you open like the comin of the Pope
When I group shit tighter than a 3 piece suit
(Peace, peace) Peace to niggas I rhyme wit
My Outsidaz correspondents be more fluid than embalmin
(We pros) I decompose, any rapper to the bone
Down to they X and Y chromosome
So SEE MY NAME tagged in bold or italics (Bow, bitch)
Cuz I'll be the only one salvaged
Number one imported like Beck's
Tighter than three or more heads in a CRX

(Chorus 2X)
Tight, tight, aight?
And the plans is tight
Tight, tight.. TIGHT!
Tight, tight aight?
And the plans is tight
Tight..
(Busta) One, two, three, BO!
