[Hook]
It’s a storm comin’, it’s a, it’s a storm comin’
It’s a storm comin’
It’s a, it’s a storm comin’
What you gon’ do, who can you trust?
When you feel the heat comin’, are you ready to bust?
If we have to, if we have to, feel that heat comin’
If we have to, if we have to, feel that heat comin’
If we have to

[Verse 1]
Dear son, hope you hearing every word in my chronicle
Hope it’s finding you in good health, living honorable
Caught a glimpse of the future and it don’t look bright
You gon be in for one hell of a plight
It’s a war going on outside, no art is safe from
They let you take some, unlike that mason
OG, my straight spit from day one
They tell you switch it up, just keep the faith son
Don’t let em digitize you, epitomize you
He’s just another nigga with a mic, telling lies to
Unsuspecting fans, be a self-respected man
Remember mommy’s tales of PE and ex clan, bam
Fast forward to the present day debacle
They bring you underground when you want to preach the gospel
That 13th apostle, that wasn’t on the roster
Found out that I was a female, and that they couldn’t stop her
Your mama was a soldier, heavy burden on my shoulders
Still be spitting, spitting, spitting if I had to do it over
They forever tried to terminate me
Underrate me, believed they should date me, even tried to percolate me
Now here comes the safety, but none of them could tackle
Occasional snaffle, I wave that magic lasso
Whipping up them bars, niggas craved it like the castle
Feeling the heat coming, start busting if you have to

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I don’t know where to begin, how to tell you how to win
But I do know it’s gon come down to those rhymes in the end
Some pursue other ventures, some lost they step
We done came a long way from the days of salt and pep
They told me shake sells, I took the red pill
I chose to stay street, let culture prevail
I agreed to the weave, [?] the ponytail
Girls nipping and tucking, I said what the hell
I ain’t sign up for that, but to each their own
Said it’s easier to market, easier to clone
Easier to brainwash little kids at home
Easy for them machines to set the tone
Now some say it’s high class, some say it’s hoochie
All up in the mags, free stuff in the two piece
First comes the nip slip, then comes the new leaks
Then comes the sex tape, if I’m lying sue me
I ain’t need nothing but a pen and some loose leaf
Speakers on blast, whipping round in that two seat
Jumping out, bam, show time, just me and the band
Mic checking in my B girl’s stance
Fuck cocaine, fame is a hell of a drug
How far you gon go tryna get that buzz
How many you gon fuck tryna get that plug
In the future are you still gonna get that love?
Ladies!

[Hook]

[Outro – Chuck D]
Thank you Rah Digga
No more silence or violence, just guidance
And let a mother be heard with that true word
No matter how much the powers that be be disturbed
And if it is what it is
Let us define our kids
Make strong daughters, in the ending story of our sons
This from your brother, Chuck D
