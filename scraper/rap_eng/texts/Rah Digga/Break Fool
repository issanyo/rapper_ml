Yeah
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha
Rah Digga, Dirty Harriet, Yall
Ah Shit
Bricks

[Verse 1]
See me on the block with the chromed out drop
Lambskin head to toe bustin out my halter top
'Tight' rippin through tha hood
Blow up the whole spot
With tha system
TV
All Mine
EASY!!

Working the scene on the quest for lime green
Steady puffin on brown just for the time being
Battle raps on cock I get all up in your anus (yea!)
Trying to get a record deal, battling somebody famous

Pounds to my girls as we slide up in the dance bar
Niggas in my grill like they really got a chance
Chicken heads trying to front like they not Digga fans
Say fuck yall!!
Groupies
Do me
TRULY

Shittin on MC's, what I do for a living
Tight takin over spots like my name was Robin Givens
Anybody got a beat, then they better keep it hittin
Retailers put your fit in for the hottest chick spittin

[Hook]
This for my niggas and bitches making moves
In the day you play it cool, by night you break fools
Say flood it, whip it, smoke it, trick it
Flood it, whip it, smoke it, trick it
This for my niggas and bitches makin moves
In the day you play it cool, by night you break fools
Say flood it up (Flood it up)
Whip it up (Whip it up)
Smoke it up (Smoke it up)
Trick it up (Trick it up)

[Verse 2]
VIP area
Certain heads get in
Cats without wristbands steady trying to slip in
Weed on delivery, everybody chip in
Dump it, roll it, spark it, smoke it

Ladies where you at say 'Do you queen!'
Got a crib, got a whip, high heels, and tight jeans
My straight thug bitches rock Tims and tattoos
After one or two drinks be ready to act fool!

Now, this for my real live underground cats
Who be checkin for the rhymes
Not checkin for the track
Take away all the hype and a nigga straight wack
Say fuck that!
Fuck that!
Fuck that!
Fuck that!

My squad hold it down passin bars, passin mics
Make emcees stay at home with water and flashlights
Ya'll motherfuckers crazy tell him 'Get the dick'
Trying to see my clique, ain't even getting past the chick

[Hook]
This for my niggas and bitches makin moves
In the day you play it cool, by night you break fools
Say flood it, whip it, smoke it, trick it
Flood it, whip it, smoke it, trick it
This for my niggas and bitches makin moves
In the day you play it cool, by night you break fools
Say flood it up (Flood it up)
Whip it up (Whip it up)
Smoke it up (Smoke it up)
Trick it up (Trick it up)

[Verse 3]
For those who want to whip it
For those who want to flood it
For those who want to buy it
For those who want to dub it
For those who want the sexy
For those who want the rugged
Say Digga
DIGGA
Hardcore
Love it!

Comin up fast while you're fallin even faster
A blitz on a Jack handling my money matters
For those who want to smoke it
For those who want to trick it
For those who want to hate me
Niggas know where they can stick it

[Hook 2x]
This for my niggas and bitches makin moves
In the day you play it cool, by night you break fools
Say flood it, whip it, smoke it, trick it
Flood it, whip it, smoke it, trick it
This for my niggas and bitches makin moves
In the day you play it cool, by night you break fools
Say flood it up (Flood it up)
Whip it up (Whip it up)
Smoke it up (Smoke it up)
Trick it up (Trick it up)
