Talked about who rips it right
Always keep a crowd goin like a schoolyard fight
Always hold it down lovely when it's time to bulid
Been doin musical chairs like Levert, Sweat, and Gill
Who doubt me niggas on the internet shout me
Playin me close or leave your bitter house stout b
Pullin chips if it's a bet you want
I'll demolish you and your fuckin debutom boy
Talkin bout she rap now y'all niggas is sick
I'll be milky like ways or milky like wick or
Whatever type phrase rappers choose to model
I'll take it right from you then have my peoples rob you

We gon hit you with the heat like you motherfucking Spawn

CHORUS: Rampage and Rah Digga
This is what happens
When you fuck with my clique

Rampage , I'm the biggest thing in life (life)

Gotta stay focused can't lose the drive
Help my moms and my pops quit they nine to five
