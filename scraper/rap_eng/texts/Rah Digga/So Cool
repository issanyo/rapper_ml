(That cool shit)
Call me conductor, I lead the way for ya
Underground vibe, status self-employed
R-A-H aka Harriet Thugman
Carry out the legacy with seed and husband
Now off with the head thangy
Watch flip to a genie
And I be a Mac like Beanie
Out the bottle, I turn thug super model
With rhymes that'll make ya have to settle for Movado
The dirtiest getting all the way live
Steady tappin' my shit, try-na eat while I drive
Speeding to a function to play the little actress
Three hours late and don't even know the address
Madness with the ill sexy flow
And the label spendin' g's not tryin' to let me go
Rockin' on the stage after me, YOU FOOL!
Cause I am so cool

[Carl Thomas](Rah Digga)
Cause she's so cool, yeah oh
Money baby can't you see
(Can't you see, can't you see)
She's so cool
And you can't be as fly as she
(Never be as fly as me)

[Rah Digga]
I aim high beat date in December
A million motherfuckers whose face I don't remember
Next to fall with the b-girl ball
Tight gear little cousins
The store from the mall
Rockin' hardcore to some R&B shit
Kickin' rhymes for the round-the-way heads
That I'm at peace with
Love the ice rock silver as a preference
Taking writer's credit so offer a suggestion
So bust dem heads who ain't real wit it
Who don't want shit in life and can't deal with it
I see you
Frontin' like you on my side
Switch sides thanks for the ride bitch
See me on the cover, (Say what?) strike a pose
Just know after that I'm making off with the clothes
Underground rule for real, so what's the haps?
Take it back like kids who fight in playing caps
Or Jacks 'N' Ball, freestyle off the wall
Tell em don't forget the stones when they make the Digga dome
Do away with styling you ain't even found yet
Blow the mic out and ain't nothing but a sound check
Writing rhymes like you wish you could
Tight breaking em down on behalf of sisterhood
Spittin' every time use my looks as a tool
Cause I am so cool

[Carl Thomas](Rah Digga)
Cause she's so cool
Money baby can't you see
(Can't you see, can't you see)
She's so cool
And you can't be as fly as she
(Never be as fly as me)
Cool
Money baby can't you see
(Can't you see, can't you see)
She's so cool
And you can't be as fly as she
(Never be as fly as me)
She's so, so
You can't be as fly as she, oh
