[Casey Lee]
The B to the L, the A to the Z to the E
Early twenties, girls by the twenties
Rims buy 'em twenty, never gin slide me Henny
Blunts roll in twenties, got my stunts holdin' semis
Blaze in the Bentley; be like Jay, "Come and Get Me"
Straight from Q-U-E percisely 40P

[Rah Digga]
Yo you that brother that I always see on MTV
I ain't cop your album got it off the MP3
But it's hot though take it from another emcee
That's what I'm tryna be

[Casey Lee]
Shorty it's the M-O-N-E-Y
My wrists will leave your eyes B-L-I-N-D
My passion for poetry and parting from poverty
Leaves me in position to mould my own like pottery

[Rah Digga] + (Joy Bryant)
Heh, ain't really sweatin' you brother, we tryna parlay see
(I heard A&R was short for armed robbery)
I heard selling records is like hitting the lottery

[Casey Lee]
All you need is talent shorty, Blaze got plenty
Shorty holla, come on

The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E (*repeat 8X*)

[Casey Lee] + (Joy Bryant)
If you start from my toes to my dome like Gators
Iceburg, Gucci, my head cap is Raiders
CD so hot you gotta play hot potato
And Primo won't even take me out with the fader
Cause my voice is laid with paper, my crib, Jamaica
You know the action, get planes built to go there
(What about your Grammy?)
Got it chillin' at my mother's crib
Right next to the Golden Globe
For actin' like I give a fuck

[Rah Digga]
What you talkin' 'bout? Diamond life, you livin' it
Benji's, Bentley's, your cash flow is infinite

[Casey Lee]
But you know there's more to life than videos
They're different
Cali is where it's at
And that's a wrap, my lip I'm zippin' it

The B, the L, the A, the Z, the E (*repeat 8X*)
