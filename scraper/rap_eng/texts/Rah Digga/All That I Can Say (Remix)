[Mary]
Ooh, ooh

[Rah Digga]
Uh, uh, uh The Rah D-I-G
Here to rap on behalf
All the females headed down the wrong path
Things gonna change when we hit the set
Put an end to the pain and the disrespect
My Flipmode brother gonna switch his pitch
Like we ain't supposed to know when he talking to a chick
Too fly for that to even make that an issue
Take little chicken head baby moms with you

[Mary]
Loving you is what I thought
In my mind was a miracle
But times have changed and you have changed with them too
How foolish of me
To think that you would be
Someone that I can hold on to
Something in my mind
Was warning me all the time
That you were no angel and neither was I
I tried and tried and tried
To bring peace into our lives
But you continued to flip and try to take control of my life and I

1 - [Mary] (Rah Digga)
I don't know
Where we went wrong
All that I can say
He never loved me anyway
(He didn't love you, he didn't love you, come on)

[Mary]
I had been with you
Through everything that you've been through
But it hurts me to my heart that you don't realize
That I've only stayed around, not to cry tears of a clown
But to someday end up being your wife but you lie
Liar, cheater, deceiver and a woman beater
About to give up
Because you want me to sell it short
Boyfriend, little boy
I've been played like a toy
Wondering in your heart
To give someone else a brand new start

Repeat 1 (2x)

[Rah Digga]
How ill is this?
Playing games with my mental
All them other heartbreaker dealers I've done went through
I'm just too fly for that
Now all the ladies say, I'm just too fly for that
And now don't be surprised
Catching you in all kinds of lies
If a honey come flip, start chasing you with knives
You gonna feel the wrath that's word is bond
Cause ain't nothing worse than a ghetto chick scorned

Repeat 1 till end
