(Verse 1: Rah Digga)
We 'gon take this through the roof
See me on the move checkin cats like who's who
Fall through a little spot me and the whole gang
Flirt with a couple cats but I don't say no names
Here we go now, I'm like gypsy chicks
See me cruisin until that my sixties wipped
And we off to the races (Say what?!)
Me and all my aces everywhere we go the same faces
Wave yo' hands, Jersey clan
Drink a little somethin at the MGM Grand
Mami fly, watch your man
Me takin loses I be damn
What's the crew name (Flipmode) off the chain (Big dogs)
And we stay in the flossin game
See me on the front line like G.I. Jane
Old girl get it locked shhh I ain't playin

(Chorus)
Everybody on the floor I tell ya all
And if ya don't do nothin but play the wall
Come on left side (Left side) right side (Right side)
Front to back come on everybody
We 'gon party and bullshit and party and bullshit
And party and bullshit and party and bullshit

(Verse 2: Rah Digga)
I beat that bitch with a bat (Say what?!)
I beat that bitch with a bat (Say what?!)
Get stank I'm a flip to a New York Yank
Love is love ma leave it at that
You see where I'm at movie star like Lucy Liu
Keepin up with me how souped is you?!
Boy state your purpose get on down
Come on work this work this work this (Owww!!!!)
Pullin up to my bumper baby
Body language somethin crazy
Gettin hot in herre this is a party or what
Only been here a minute cats startin it up
Got trees got licks of the yack (Say what?!)
Got trees got licks of the yack (Say what?!)
Come one come all we 'gon have a ball
Bitch mob got seats in the back (Ho!!!!)

(Chorus: Rah Digga)
Everybody on the floor I tell ya all
And if ya don't do nothin but play the wall
Come on left side (Left side) right side (Right side)
Front to back come on everybody
We 'gon party and bullshit and party and bullshit
And party and bullshit and party and bullshit

(Bridge: Rah Digga) + (Just Blaze)
Shake it around shake it, shake it around shake it
Shake it around shake it
(Just Blaze!) Shake it around shake it

(Verse 3: Rah Digga)
It's time for the percolator, Dj's 'gon rock the fader
Come on drop it like a hot potato
Everybody let's percolator (Come on!)
Fellas in the club lookin righteous
With a tight chest I think I might just
Hit 'em with a little Biggie one on one
Talkin 'bout he stops drinkin now that ain't no fun
Yeah I'm on that, a little cognac
In the system watch mami straight throw it back
Come on shake it around bounce it around break it on down
Digga Digga is crazy right now

(Chorus: Rah Digga)
Everybody on the floor I tell ya all
And if ya don't do nothin but play the wall
Come on left side (Left side) right side (Right side)
Front to back come on everybody
We 'gon party and bullshit and party and bullshit
And party and bullshit and party and bullshit

(Outro: Just Blaze) + (Rah Digga)
