Where's my sisters?
Where's my sisters?
This one's for the brothers
The brothers, the brothers
Said I be rappin' for da ladies
What's up ladies?
But this one's for da brothers
The brothers, the brothers
Yeah check it out now

Now I'm the baby in the family
And I got three siblings
Three older brothers and we trying to make a living
So we hustle and we bubble
And we coming up fast
Ain't gon' never be the same
Since mom and pops past
The oldest one, child prodigy no doubt
Every since he was a kid used to ride a bitch out
All grown up now
Nice job, nice clout
Nice wife, nice house, try-na take the right route
Treat sis like a queen brother gave me everything
Any time I got in trouble he could probably pull some strings
Walk daddy's footsteps and career same speed
Made the greatest big brother and a father to his own seed
(Uh-oh) But something happened on the job, he started snappin'
Problems with the wifee, winging out and started cappin'
Tried to turn himself in just to make things right
Ended up taking flight cause he's not the jail type

Now I got a second brother me and this one was closer
Made me a little tom boy like he was supposed to
Tearing up the place blowing weed in my face
Irresponsible to death parents stayed on his case
Probably cause he wanted to be the baby in the family
Drinking with his friends, macking up
Mommy carried me, look half way crook getting crazy on the mic
Wasn't really into rap but the shit sound tight
He used to tell me all the time
Don't wet none sis
By this time next year we gon' be dumb rich
That's when I heard the ill
My physical got killed
Just a couple of weeks after signing a record deal
Now somebody gots to bust and have to get a little tough
And on the block round the clock
Niggas ain't seen nothing
Yeah right
Never seen a brother more determined or eager
Moms and pops couldn't see it
Now we not gonna see it either

Now my last and final brother, kinda something out the norm
Some say part depressed some say part deformed
Record unclean since his early teens
In and out the youth house
Playing all the crime scenes
Early hangin' with fiends smoking all types of things
He used to chase a basketball now he chasing pipe dreams
From the door, shit was wrong undetected too long
Bugged out when he was little
Now he big that was wrong
Little too early had to kick him out the house
He just wanted some attention that's what dad was all about
He used to bust down the door
Moms cry, pops fight
Even family counseling couldn't make this shit right
Word on the street every body wanna do him
]From his so-called boys to all the chickens he was screwin'
Anybody get the chance, who will probably unload?
How much longer sis got before the last brother gone
OH NO!
