[Rah Digga]
Yeah! Rah Digga
Flipmode, Prymary Colorz collabo'
Let's do this
Dark Child wannabe, c'mon!

[Verse: Rah Digga]
If I only knew type of drama and stress
Wouldn't had money stay at my rest
Promise me I would live, went free
You know how that be
Keys to the whips just to make a brother happy
If I only knew, how he be at the clubs kickin' it
Probably wouldn't be in this predicament
Comin' home wee hours, express his sentiment
But baby boy you ain't the only one that get it in

[Chorus - 1: Prymary Colorz]
I'd never do the things he does to you
I'd show you better if you only knew
What I've been searching for is all in you
I know I'm better than your man
If you only knew

[Verse: Marcus Dilley]
I wanna know why you trying to act
Like you've never been hurt
I wanna know why you wanting better
But still choose the worst
I wanna know why you look at me as if you wanna see
If I know all the rights for you
But how you gonna see?

[Prymary Colorz]
If we were together (you and me)
I'd do whatever (wait and see)
And I'd thank you whether
(Whether good or bad, happy or sad)
Cause I know what to do
Please let me show you (please let me)
If you only knew
(What it would be like if you were mine)

[Chorus - 1]

[Verse: Rah Digga]
I found a brother that I always knew
Had it going on crazy, but I tried to stay true
And be a good wifey, play my post tightly
Hoping you would change but it's highly unlikely
Cut the brother loose but that's funny to him
Got a new man wit way more money than him
Wish you well boy, hope you get your game together
Cause I got mine, better late than never, dirty

[Chorus - 2: Prymary Colorz]
I'd never do the things he does to you
I know I'm better than your man
If you only knew

[Verse: Josh Royals]
You oughta' know
I'm the type of guy who puts his lady first
You oughta' know that I understand
And respect a woman's worth
You oughta' know
There's no better love than what would come from me
You should know, I'm the one for you
And I'll be all you need!

[Prymary Colorz]
If we were together (you and me)
I'd do whatever (just wait and see)
And I'd thank you whether
(Whether good or bad, happy or sad)
Cause I know what to do (yes I do)
Please let me show you (let me show you)
If you only knew
(What it would be like if you were mine)

[Chorus - 1] (2x)
