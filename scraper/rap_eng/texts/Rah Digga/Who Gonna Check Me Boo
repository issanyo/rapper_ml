Hey Boo, who gonna check me
Ya thought yo all had the … did you?
Yeah, oh, study fortunate throttle to … so I got the Louie machina so I could smuggle the bottle
About the war, brick city, see the streets respecter
Police on electro, I keeps the extra, the Gucci fleece sweaters, all our reeks …
The same ...bitch now I speak better
More than lace and tracks I … dust it
Nothing less than crack we riding us touch it
Our box cut it, watch the blocks bust it
I got them shit bubbling like shots in your bottom
Little more than a problem, Nostradamo
Never on schedule always good timing
I'm right back on it, I'm right back on it
Ain't even gotta try just suck my ball with
The blink of an eye now the streets are zone us
And do the damn thang till I'm open in shortness, come on
Who's gonna check me boo, not you
Who's gonna check me boo, not you
Who's gonna check me boo, not you
Who's gonna check me boo, not you
Got a whole lot of flack and … you
People still, digga digga, now what's left to prove
Spitting properly, ever since ...and foxy, copy, tip and socky
Shrimp and … I turn the hippie when I hit that sticky
Worse than cake, I transform like whip whinkley
All these chicks geeks and less than 6 weeks
I shot all down like tell the … bitch, shut up bitch
Dipping off chain poses, switch seats, back on the stage, might let that bitch speak
Singin all of their hook like swiss beats, freeze
Who's gonna check me boo, not you
Who's gonna check me boo, not you
Who's gonna check me boo, not you
Who's gonna check me boo, not you
If I was you I wouldn't try no papers, never know what's next your name come up on that paper
Get assassinated, lyrically lacerated, to men this is exasperating
Got a classic waiting, let's go, trimming jay to vay … follow way to the ga
Drive me in the streets watch ...to a …
Thing I'm gonna scorch … you … is replay
Go DJ, and I'ma spit it all, I bring the pain you can't … windows in a raw
An old friend's a … real suspect ya, I ain't sharing no ...I might just … this
Did you expect it to get this … I even spit backwards like the bitch dyslexic
Me address … next hip hop's back …
Last chick try to flex that ass got checked, let's go
Who's gonna check me boo, not you
Who's gonna check me boo, not you
Who's gonna check me boo, not you
Who's gonna check me boo
