This face expression of a baller
Shot calla, gettin down for miles of travelin through these walls
Leavin the green ova bi***es, shady tells a 50 licks
It's sad i had to leave em in critacal conditions
Up in that hoodulum wall club poorin liquor on niggas
It's green fellish for life dere they go hit the lights
Back do it in park,as i bounced up out that cash po'
Call up Joe, Where he at?, he at tha airport
Duckin an runnin frum these po pos they outta control
30 cops chasin a nigga frum the ghetto
Got away clean, ???????????
Tired as hell i put that suit case down

(repeat hook)

Poorin out liquor fo all my soldiers that died
In these ghetto days, bussin bottles and shoot the bi***es

On the souf side where hard heads ride we keep it real
