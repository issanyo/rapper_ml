Callin' all cars, callin' all cars, uh uh, Yung Wun is here
Callin' all cars, callin' all cars, back up, back up, back up ( We gotta problem! )

[Verse 1:]
Time and time again, I try to be on the good foot
But ladies don't be given me good looks
It's hard when you livin' like us
I started the good book
It's just what I see that got me shook
Mean mugs and cold stance take a nigga down
And to make him fail, I'mma take it to you how
Lights out, closed casket, murder warn
Young one come through with the under grudge
And live the life, don't talk about it
Don't make beef, come walk about it
Everybody know my name because I play in the street
Not because I say I'm street, mutha fucker

[Chorus:]
All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty
All my niggas is thirsy, thirsty thirsty
Now I don't give a fuck, if ya'll don't give a fuck
All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty
All my niggas is thirsty
Well I don't give a fuck if ya'll don't give a fuck

[Verse 2:]
Ya'll trying to sound like 'Pac
I dunno why though
Sounded like 'Pac is a position you shouldn't try for
They don't understand why they die for
And tell lies about black folk, and take from they own folk
That type of shit heavy poppin' through the stove
Cause you don't want to show your face
Cause its a known place
And I don't love her face when she take from me man
And I don't give a fuck what you think of me
Cause what you think of me is nothin' but a mere decision
And they shipped my ass off ta prison
If I die than death is a given
And if I live let me enjoy living
That's a wonderful feeling

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3:]
As a kid I had no life for life
Everything I do they say it wasn't right
Doesn't matter huslters scatter
Everyday from 12 in the A-T-L
So love is like the wind blowing cold off the scale
Tell me what's going on
Two wrongs don't make a right
But I know two holes in your dome with take your life
I'm on the precious shorty
They coming after what I treasure
Its time we start renting out yachts
Yung Wun yacht masters ship out blocks
Hold my block why'll I hand out Glocks
Send the niggas over the hill
When they done, go pop somebody for sho

[Chorus: x2]

A town where you at!
