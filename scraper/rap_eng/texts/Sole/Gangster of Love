Rap game Sadaam Hussein meets Lil Wayne meets the third rail, but I come back like cicadas
Never run cause rap is my escapism, been rolling with the pedestrian since I was 15
On some west coast is wack then you gave me fellowship, now I got Myka 9 and Žižek on speed-dial 
Can't say I'm the future I know there ain't one, no hell for old men but memories pass the AK
Pass my sister's sparkling mead, let the weed pass me by
Pass my demo to a rich motherfucker I could use a few mill, without the devil deal
All my dreams are hood internets like the desert of the real is a place you can’t escape unless you’re dead or jail
Or in one of those places 3G can’t reach
I love this shit too much to give a thumbs up to ironic seals that need to be clubbed in the club
Art is war and war is here, we stay holding the line even though the lines are blurry
Cats are worried that my phone is tapped, shit I’d be worried if it wasn't but what the fuck I care?
The real terrorists are the ones we got our eyes on, talk is cheap, real talk is deep
Real recognize real outlined in chalk or speaking through glass
Nowadays real artists resigned to the futility of it all, but I respect that
Ain't no turning back like we just blew four trill on an invasion and we gotta get the money back
I know rap is dead but so is America and in the end love is all we have
Love for not giving a fuck and standing with those with the courage to stand with you, when all other backs are turned
So here's to those drinking on the rocks with 3D glasses, while we just watch the world burn

If the world ends today I don't wanna live on as ones and zeros, and I'll burn to a crisp with no regrets if it ends tomorrow
Don't touch my tomatoes, leave my body to the drones
It will be sad to see my friends go but we always knew we were meant for the mud, soo many torn between prayer and disbelief
I say grow a pair and throw seeds all directions, we were born fucked and doomed
So we got married young, and watched the dust settle on everything around us
Telesthesia, I spit that McKenzie Wark shit, everybody got amnesia says the still dancing corpse
It's easy to forgot what it really means to not live with fear in your heart
It’s hard to forget what music is because of all the things its not, I just wanna kill it till it kills me
And if I can't watch my wings melt and my body crash on the rocks
The ship wrecker's names are only remembered by the sea, shit forgetting core convictions way too easy
In my youth I was a wannabe gangsta, I still wanna be a gangsta, the gangsta of love
The world is my trigger and the trigger has no heart, my brain is bleeding and my toys snitch on me
Listen actually I don’t care if you do or don’t, but don’t confuse me with those who don’t use their illusion to shatter illusions
In this world of mall cops getting out of bed is like inciting a riot with pillow talk
The gangster of love
