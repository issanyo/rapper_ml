血染めの/
赤い糸で結ばれた先進国の陽だまりと /
第三世界のぬかるみ 小洒落たいつもの店先で搾取と /
握手 買い物籠に放り込んだメイドインどこの国？/
の悲劇の焼き増し 前頭葉全土に押されたブランドという烙印/
知らぬ間に末端で加担している惨澹たる貧困のサイクル/
いたいけな子供心を虜にする夢と /
希望に満ちた愛くるしいキャラクターの数々はおたくのお子さんと /
なんら変わらぬ異国の少年少女の悪夢と /
絶望から生産されている 幼き/
命が次々と常闇の実を摘み取り、 か弱き /
指先であくせく縫い付けるあざとい儲け話/
私のスニーカーにも燦然と輝く略奪の証/

A bloodstained red thread of faith
Ties together a sunny spot of an advanced nation
And the sludge of a developing country. Shake hands with exploitation
In front of the usual stylish shops. Goods made in anonymous countries thrown Into baskets
A duplicate of tragedy. Whole frontal lobe branded with a logo
Unknowingly participating at one end of the miserable cycle of poverty
The dream that captures innocent child’s minds
And the many cute characters full of hope are manufactured from
The despair and nightmares of boys and girls from foreign countries
No different from your children
The youth reap the fruit of everlasting darkness
Fragile fingers busily sow on clever get-rich-quick schemes
Even on my sneakers, shines the dazzling proof of plunder

(Sole)
In this interconnected world its foolish to have masters
I know what truth is to fingers scraping in nooses
Reflect the true cost of an item by how much time was stolen
To make the boots you stomp mesopotamia
There is no future in meat shipped frozen across the water
You are what you eat in this age of chemicals
Work ain't work when commitments are endless
Going through the maze eyes burned out can't figure out where the end is
Know your friends, usually the opposite of who it is that you get money from
Know the hard workers by how humanity punishes them
Bosses we suffer them
And why do they hose us while we enable them
To bleed the world dry on its pendulum
To try to work the land like cows till they bleed

Thats why i consider japan part of the west
At the end of the war you got your citizenship
Brother, they bombing me too
Baptized im blinding light
Only radio defies gravity
And god don't know whats in the water
Whats in the air
The ball is out of control
And when demands are finally met
We will make cars out of shopping carts

Oh rust belt fellows who no longer produce i pity you
Managing the isles of walmart
And part time at starbucks
To buy more time on earth
Only working for the "benefits"
Tell me who among us truly benefits from their own labor

Barely me with swollen gums
And itchy trigger finger
I know my enemy
And when i die, let someone in india replace me
At equal cost
Because the caste system is ongoing
Capitol accumulates from mt. Sinai and keeps rolling
Everything we know through filters mocks us
All that escapes the filters is gas station moccasins
Buy us out or sell us in
History it tells us that we can't win
Armed with pitchforks and torches
We fight for the light that'll never touch us

奈落の底で不当に巻き上げられる無邪気な笑顔/
あいつのTシャツにも浮かび上がる地獄絵図のプリント/
雀の涙以下の手当てと引き換えに貢がれていく /
健やかなる明日 腰履きの俺のデニムにも現れた /
聖痕現象 独りでに敗れていくその穴は引き裂かれた /
女神の傷口だ 恵みをもたらすはずの資源が /
戦いの術を調達し、あの子の携帯に埋め込まれた /
争いの欠片。 富を独占する一握りの長者は /
溢れかえる貧者を好んで喰らうという/
毎朝飲んでいるコーヒーも、2/14のチョコレートも /
ことごとく同じこと 彼らの苦しみと我らの楽しみは/
表裏一体 表も裏も等しく、この世の現実/
君と僕の日常のありふれた行動それらひとつ /
ひとつが時代と対峙する信任投票 大義は大悟の元/
鵜呑みにした綺麗ごとを吐き出せ/

[Kaigen - Translation]
Innocent smiles ripped off unjustly in a bottomless pit
Hell’s landscape printed even on that guy’s T-shirt
A healthy tomorrow traded in for less than chicken feed compensation
Stigmata mark my sagging jeans
Self destruction, the holes naturally torn are wounds of a goddess
Recourses, which were supposed to grant a blessing
Brought the skills for warfare and a chip of conflict
Ends up embedded in her cell
Handful of millionaires monopolizing wealth
Choose to feast on an ocean of poverty
The coffee we drink every morning and the chocolate of valentines day
Are all the same. Their suffering and our pleasure are nothing but
Two sides of the same coin. The front and back, equally a reality of this world
Each and every daily and usual action, you and I
Make is a vote of confidence face to face with this age
Out of doubt comes enlightenment
So spit out the sugarcoat that you swallowed
