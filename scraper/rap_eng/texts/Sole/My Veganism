What up to all the prairie dog colonies in the thread some condominiums

Let's do this

I never talk about how I'm a vegan cause I recall how cats used to rub each others nose in it
On some what kind of shoes are those, all I know I prefer a couple dogs than most human beings
Used to pick veins out my chicken legs, till I found out how hotdogs are made
Always treated like a personal choice, but changing your habits does little to defend those that have no voice
Shouts to Charlotte's Web and the pets we kept, R I P to those that died in a cage
Playing god is harder than you think ask anyone who's had a salt water tank
And I don't get how Pro-Lifers wanna save a fetus, but will bash a cow's skull in and milk it till it bleeds
You drink pus and blood in your milk and say that the food that I'm eating is strange
I've been vegetarian for twenty-four years my bones don't break, it ain't your fault your society is sick
You've spawned so many forms of prejudice that you escape blame, someday we'll view all life on earth as the same
Think nothing of eating pigs you wouldn't eat a dog, even if pigs are smarter and feel the same pain
I can't stand PETA videos with cow's squirming hung on conveyor belts

They're supposed to be tools to educate but they make us look insane
I can't watch like I can't view photos of the holocaust not to equivocate
But how is 200 billion deaths a year not a holocaust, especially when half of it goes to waste
The native would do dances to honor the sacrifice, you watch the game

The San Francisco zoo is a depressing place it's so cold, that's why the animals there are sad
Shouts to the Siberian tiger, Tatiana that mauled those dudes after they threw shit at her
Escaped the cage and wondered the grounds for half of an hour, until she found 'em in the caf√©
They ain't laughing in their graves
Everybody loved Jumbo the Elephant, but he was trained with a barbed razor spear
Kept in a cell for most of the day, was so depressed and angry his trainer had to get him drunk to perform
Enough about mankind though, yeah nature's brutal
It's full of booms and busts and droughts
But were supposed to be better than that and our bodies weren't designed to eat meat
'cause our intestines run thirty feet, and our teeth aren't razor sharp
And our claws are fingers evolved for picking fruit and building shit
Not trying to tell anyone how to live, but next time you eat an egg think about a chicken's period
Not trying to be on a soap-box, but picture your dog or your cat in the slaughterhouse
