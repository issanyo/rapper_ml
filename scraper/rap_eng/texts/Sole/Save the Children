[Sole]
Thank God I never made it to Earth, what a happy place
How I long to be depressed, to be a grouch, get away

Yo, yo...

[Verse 1]
Here I stand in the desert sands
There I lay in a dust storm, brain storms
Some day we may form a massive collective mind with no bandages
I kneel down to fantasy of what is real
Thus far the only signs of freshness
I came across upon this quest was nothingness
Posessed to find truth at all costs elementally
I walk a thin line of good and evil, coincidentally
We all believe in god and nature and higher levels
Yet we dwell with devil's machinery in lower levels of raped scenery
It's seemingly endless
Demeaning and mindless, we're friendless and meaningless
Living in darkness walking with candles
And while I'm on the subject of difference is lame
I've noticed the more things change the more things stay the same
To stay in focus
It's hopeless to go against the grain while new to this
Till I'm menopaused and then ejected from the uterus

Chorus
And I've seen so far into the night
And lingered in the land of no light

[Verse 2]
Day two I've left earth and all is alien and foreign
Females are wailing and I'm swimming in a cespool- it's pouring
It ain't dark no more, no more worth the fight
My old candles turn to sunglasses, I can't stand the light
Yet I can't stand the rain- these bodies I live with are numb
And I can't stand the pain- these children I play with are dumb
A figure points a finger and whispers, "leave"
This small porcelain tomb
It will be all I will have achieved
And I refuse to be excrement
Dash to the left to try to and break for my life
A large hand grabs me now, there's no escape
I'm thrown into a whirlpool, spinning until infinity
Grasping for an oxygen breath, but I don't breath that yet
Inhale the H20 and thank life I'm still living breath
Giving death a hell of a run until the movement stops
Bubble to the surface, almost dead ass out
Starving, cold, and alone until I pass out...

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Living ain't all that, I wanna go back to non-existence
The womb was not meant to be a tomb, but once I've gone the distance
Won't sleep to see revenge for my dead sibling, I miss her
I watched my brother be impaled as I held the hand of my sister
Kissed her when she was void
Missed the missile, I'm docile
Amongst dead soil and fossil till I'm deployed
None of it ever happened
As far as I'm concerned I'm barred
Should've died months ago in the condom and this wouldn't have been so hard
Shouldn't of, but it's not that way
I fought that way
I lay until I no longer thought that way
None of this was worth the fight, I should have been disposed
At night time, laying only half of the trash can
Not white trash in a trailer park
Or a dismembered rash lashing utter last sole member of a coat-hanger-tailored art
With no formed identity, blanketed by newspapers
Remedy be levity
Life be the penalty
This body in a mask grow fast- carry out the masquerade
I lay in the cut to hear lies (pawns, peons, and tricks of this trade)
In this eon let me be on and beyond the next decade
There I stayed remain of flux to be another child saved

Chorus
