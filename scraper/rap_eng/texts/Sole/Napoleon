[Verse 1]
Hotter than the border, cooler than the corpse
They call me Young Sole with that suicide voice
I'm a workhorse, rap is my glue
In this ghost-town it's always high noon
Bury my peers, without wasting ammo
And you don't wanna battle, emulate my hustle
I'm the Lawnmower Man fightn' asteroid turf
And I don't mind at all, my blade don't dull
My name rings bells and burns bridges
The industry hates me cuz I'm still eatin'
An amateur chef fucking with rare spices
Ain't had no fast food since I worked at McDonald's
Self made man, nobody gave me shit too
Except my addict father, thanks for the anger issues
Keep your friends close and the hate at bay
Don't be mad at me that bitterness will eat you alive
In middle school I read Animal Farm
And that's the real reason I had to pull out the card
When those words leave my mouth it's like a cold dagger
But this is my blood, and no one else's labor

[Hook]
Like a pig that can walk you are taller than me
But I can run away, or I can butcher you
Like a pig who can talk you say I am a fool
But I can eat you, because you're just a pig

[Verse 2]
I make the music that I wanna make
Doin' this race you gotta break some legs you gotta your dues
Stare in the mirror, deep in them pupils beneath the lens lye the universe
Hundred light-years and sinkin'
On some space shit, some base their music
When all you hear is explosives put down your weapon
Snuggle up to the cold shoulder, cast your vote by the seed
There's a quiet goin' on, don't sleep
My teacher said get a GED pull out my classes
Except my art teacher, said I would be famous
Instead I'm infamous, the underwater MC
The microorganism stayin' alive by thermal vents under the sea
Where light barely reaches, where the preachers are slain
Where curiosity dies cuz the teachers are lame
I've picked my sides, it's a loosing battle
Like my mother's book, it's that path less traveled
No justice for the weak, no president can save us
No dying on our knees, only our dreams can kill us
At age 20 knowing everything it was my style
I was older than that then, I'm younger than that now
