I hope you like my stupid painting
It won't be here next time, you'll burn it
I'm no matisse and never said i could paint
The way things are going..i dunno if i'm gonna finish it
I graduated with passin' colors
Into the world and directly through the other side
Fitting in isn't about what you know
It's what you don't know that makes you a team player
So many ways to freeze but never teached us one.....
