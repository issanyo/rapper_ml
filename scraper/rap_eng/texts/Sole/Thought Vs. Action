[Doseone]
Shh, Shhh
Sheer stimulated advantage grown from a bond
Barely instantaneous, allotted is, precedence left [arm]
A not so subtle rampant founding foster
(fostered) Fostering…

[Slug]
The halters engulfed, think lost worth, impulse
In a cage match with instinct tossed
Regressive, wretched, stopped, re-read the sketches
No rocks off for the restless (restless) restless

[Doseone]
Restless whence we broke a-
Take a cleanly, instruct car, stick and stone nebulous
One caught from flowering interconnectedness
Assure it never happen (again)

[Slug]
In about four seconds the teacher will begin to think
Wedged in between when he take a swing and when he blink
Hard as me try, me never be the man
Cause people keep taking my stand as pacifist that a plan

[Doseone]
The, beyond, any, begin, however, before, it was, or never
Would’ve, been, occurred, ever, been born again
(Slug: What’s done is… what’s done is… done is undone)

[Slug]
Who’s the one that’s gonna die for this? (nobody move)
And who’s the one that’s gonna fry for this? (nobody move)
And who’s the one that’s gonna try to kiss (nobody move)
Life smack dead on her lips, her apocalypse (nobody ends)

[Doseone]
It’s shot tranquil grey order, out so fast

[Slug]
Sacred, communicated each individual emotion

[Doseone]
A car sole crashes the is and nothing left

[Slug]
However traces of hatred found in the fossils and erosion

[Doseone]
He no finish finer that truce

[Slug]
When the lake get lit fire and the flames hit eye level

[Doseone]
Giving the logic a perfect approve

[Slug]
I’ll be scorned, torn by swarm inside asking me “Why settle?”

(He lay down in the tall grass and prepared to wait patiently. Soon the sounds of distant sweet music came to his ears. He looked up in the direction from which they came and saw a small object descending from above. At first it looked like a mere speck, but as it came down, the music became planer and sweeter.)

[Alias & Sole]
Oh how they stifle
Siphon emotion, eye motion
I motion, mostly the disembowelment of vowel movement is best measured by how many books you burn
How many scholarly notions
Cascading through morbid emotions
Window pane evading

[Sole]
Chased by fading echoing, decaying masculids
Master thin candles and incense
Glasses seeping condescending sentence
Afterwards, I find no antidote for petty anecdotes
Swing fist before two lips alone

[Alias]
No hope for those who ponder, wondering
Through cells brought forth by useless electrodes and
Modes of weakness, weakness of the movement erodes
You well to intake endowing measures
The pleasures of performing and executing
Ballads prearranged on ledger form a...

[Sole, Alias]
Catalyst, cataclysm, fallacy, fortitude, medulla
Menacing, medicine, flushing

[Sole]
Spiralling unto the shallow depths of thoughtful mess

[Alias]
Best cast upon the liberated, jaded renaissance man

[Sole]
Man, I once had an idea but it didn’t get me anywhere
Read the art of war when I should have been out fighting
Why is it the mass is unexposed to so-called great thinkers until they die?
And why do they in fear
Of the fighters afraid to leave their insides?

[Alias]
Ah, talking, talking, walking in circles slowly assembling
A faux pas way of thought, (but all thought is faux pas)
Good point brought to the table of man or myth imploring
Bumping up
Demanding the process of leaping before jumping

[Sole]
I say take a leap of faith, besides
Nobody woulda knew the [off] if they
Didn’t pick up a pen and action and act in
Got me more than imagining the soul, lies
Words only count in assholes and elbows

[Alias]
Pose a moving question for eternal value and mental redemption
Inducing actions for future thought processes exemption

[Sole]
I need not thought, for when a father impulses nature
[Bowl] my hands collect dust

[Alias, Sole]
I recollect a loss of lust
