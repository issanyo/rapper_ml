[Verse 1: Sole]
Well its 7:45 oh yeah
We'll see who's the bigger man
Other dead men walking- 4:00p.m., I heard a dead man talking
He said it's inconsequential
Forget it- it's nice
I'll always get into harlots Ville with this knife
Get away- I don't want to buy you a drink
Forget to piss on your pride, little girl
Yeah stepped on your feet
You want to eat that dirty white how what ya looking at
The cap bartender, tender me some sex on the beach
Before I reach out and impediment your speech
Once I get 'em in my reach
Unprecedented impeach
He saw a double crossed dance illuminated by disco lights
Unseen unspoken
In a scene provoking a thought provoking scene
In a smoke scene interrupted by intervening disco lights
Ain't nobody dancing
Ain't no music everybody still
I can only see one man
He looks good enough to kill
So I muscle my way through dustless of imposers
10:30 to 10 feet away 5 fingers surround the object of entrapment
I don't need to see his eyes
I feel his jacket, then his shirt, then his skin, then his kidneys, then out
Then blood ,then blood, then blood
Then neck, then blood, then blood, then blood, chest
Then I see his girl watching over him
Like she is gonna cry his little ass back to life
This is my only way I know
So I must remove the knife
We eye to eye now
Goodbye to his life
Fool, I told you I would get my five dollars back tonight!

[Verse 2: Slug]
Another night (night)
Another dollar (dollar)
Another crowd I've enlisted to make holler (now scream)
Another I really wish this crowd was a little bit larger
Excuse me mister promoter
Could I bother you
For a couple of bottles
Of premiums placed on the stage
For me and my brethren you know beverages
Intoxication balance and leverage
Guessing this is that point where I grab the mic and make my point
Kick my flow make'em say hoooo
Blow the lid off the joint
Ahem: blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
And then they befriended- I love it when this situation happens
This the type of crowd that build self esteem
Come 10:30 is was I finally felt that sting..

(Commotion: Yo yo yo yo (hes got a knife)
Yo what the fucks going on right here
Calm the fuck down calm that shit down (that's blood)
Check check get'em up get off get off)

[Hook: Slug]
I shed another blood
You knew I would
I feel you should
Adapt can't run forever
Trapped death stepped up to
Shed another blood
You knew I would
I feel you should
Adapt can't run forever
Trapped death stepped up to...

[Verse 3: Doseone]
Sorry, just alcohol
Thanks, anyhow- its just been one of those days- alcohol only?
How can you not sell fucking cigarettes at a bar? excuse me
But I wonder where those two wild women are
I've gotten off one minute they're all ears and big eyes
Then they're wandering off
To bark up the next man's tree EXCUSE ME
Thank you Jesus Christ this place is...
Now that's a foxy young lady
If she'd only put some clothes on (excuse) enough
Iâ€™ll stay put and just vend in the meat market hummm hmmm hmmm
Who are these?- that shit's pretty dope
But I can hardly hear his vocals and the bass is too loud
Actually this kid is nasty
Too bad I can't hear the words (excuse me)
Damn like he couldn't have just walked pass- oh and the stare too
See everybody want to show you
How big their and how little they think
I be if it
Is that the chick Jim was trying to get on- she's alright
Man its hot as balls in here; why did I wear this?
(screaming) He's got a knife... is that blood
Oh my God I've never been this
That's blood he's dying, gone

[Verse 4: Alias]
Uh uh- oh my god twisting and turning
What's that sensation of burning
Yearning to witness some spoken words but now I'm learning
But I can't step into the outer limits of my abode without
Kids acting hard staring glaring
Yes I'm in the daring mode
My girl debated me going out at this nocturnal time
She said I should just chill, stay in the house and write a rhyme
I disagreed and ventured out
Totally against all of her wishes
Stated that if I went to this particular venue
I would later be needing stitches
But my manhood in the need to ease my mind has forced me out
To check and see what this up and coming lyricist is all about
Arrived at the show at 9:45 and they're saying these kids are live
Waited in line to pay my fee to take my entrance to this dive
Already performing up on stage
These kids outside smoke deuce
The rhymesayer had the crowd by the balls while up in the dj booth
Final manipulation is complex in the body of its sound
Mesmerized in higher elevated on the shoulder, I feel a pound
My right side and his right side connected accidental
He's staring in my vision
And taking, said something about knocking out dentals
Then strided out slowly
I paid no attention to his words
Cuz pursuing any challenge by forth at this point would be absurd
I saw no familiar face in the sea of goatees and baseball caps
Which is fine with me, cuz this ocean is filled with mindless saps
Just then I heard a scream behind me
There was quite a commotion
I felt something tap my back once
Then repeated in this motions
Oh my god twisting and turning
What's that sensation of burning
Yearning to just witness some spoken word but now I'm learning
I should have listen to my girl when she spoke up and debated
If I had then, my body and soul would not be separated (oh my god)

[Hook: Slug]
