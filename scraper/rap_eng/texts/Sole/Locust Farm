'till extinction
We are man shaped centrifuge collecting ridiculous items processing ridiculous orders
Man shaped mountainsides for joy rides 'till extinction
City the mass grave faces carved on terminals
Domesticated wolves turned rabid roam the outskirts of town
Village turned cynical after water turned glue
Pick up one of the many end of the world hobbies
Trees stretching their arms out to the sun is no proof of god
Welcome to my garden it's dark as day
Every man needs his own tongue to match his dream
Beware all false prophets and symbols of greed
Beware all adventures that require new colors
Every man is a movement but no movement is a man
If all must suffer for one to succeed none shall succeed
As I take off all my gold for good ask not for approval
Just space to create universe after universe
And when the universe ends
The artist as well creates a new universe. if not so be it
I've lived like an atheist while praying under my breath for some saint to save us
But the only saints I see are in paintings
Of artists gone mad and no one saved them
For being future martyrs for millionaire jokes
We create the myths to do the killings with
Washington no longer whispers it gloats
A poem called locust farm
If I could build you and set you off I would cute little grasshoppers
Can you eat buildings?
Can you jump into televisions and eat the living rooms?
Can you eat newspapers and all the bad books?
Can you bring in new monkeys to replace us?
Will you build us better schools and teach us things to make us better people?
I would like to be better
But if you don't think I'm good enough EAT ME!
If you promise not to make anyone rich
I'd make you four foot tall and bullet-proof
'till extinction
