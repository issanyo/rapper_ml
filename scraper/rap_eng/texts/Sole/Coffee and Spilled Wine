[Verse 1: Sole]
Everything around me withers (withers)
Everything around me slithers (slithers)
Everything around me splinters (splinters)
It's simple zero plus zero a thousand times is eventually one
Same with revolutions time eventually won
To be a good sniper you gotta learn to play the angles
When all you got in this life is bleeding gums and sprained ankles
When into the building leaning to the side tired and came out dreaming
Came into the world screaming and ima go out screaming
Whether they greet you with epigrams or greet you with roses
Them crows is with us the only ones that really know us
Whether they make you swallow the key and trek ??? clothless
Watch yourself if you got strong beliefs they won't lighten your load
So be scared when its bored and worn out but that's rare
Only scared when I turn to call for help and I realized that no ones there
But that's life it's in your back and you can't quite feel it till it's too late it's a knife
?When they hand you middle of the little truck made for the lies of arms and drive?
?My mekos walk there trail of dried up by sockets?
It was a childish impulse to live it the way I talk it
But where I'm from how you walk it's how they chalk it
All I've ever been is myself and if that ain't enough then fuck it

[Verse 2: Sole]
Stopped giving advice on tracks for the animals I love and christsake
I wouldn't expect anyone else to live in a pit of snakes and I've
Never been anywhere I couldn't see myself living except Vegas
There I was married there went back to visit our chapel it was buried
That ain't a sign but of the time just of more bodies for the pyre
But not mine my shrine is in the ?pond? i've been lying to say
I ain't learned nothing from throwing caution to the wind
Nobody ever gave me shit but ulcers and nerves worn thin
And that's why they curse the driver the driver curse the wheels
Since 2005 all you could do was survive if you was really real
Even if I survive my main concern would be my mental health
Ready to bring a child into the world and I can barely feed myself
On this side of the road on a cliff I'm having a dream about ?loss?
Wake up shook feeling alone not quite alone
Like a brick fighting a brick but not quite a tank
And for as long as shes been with me I've always been safe
And I've been all around the world and nobody knows me really
Only thing I ever ran from is mediocrity
So what's left? nothing but flaws in the design
And that ain't nothing but coffee stains and spilled wine
