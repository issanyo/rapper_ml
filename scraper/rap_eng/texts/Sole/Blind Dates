(on a perfect morning by Adam's old house
A tagger named sai knows what it's all about
An old blind beggar with a handwritten sign sitting in the in-style further bending his spine
On my way to write I wonder all the time are we not a species or one of a kind
These are the moments frozen in amber written at random and signed by Brandon
Like falling in love in the locked canto ward
Loosely committed but routinely widowed
And wear my wounds like a western wall
Wears broken blinds over an open window
When I say meow, ya'll say meow)

It's always life or death
On a blind date
All we can do
Is wear our lucky shirts
Corporation men
Sleeping on the train
Nervous in the elevators people are the same
A book of baby names put back on the rack
There's nothing but regret
So check out aisle number two
Regrets are like strangers until they hit on you
Cobwebs collect the dust and then they stick to you
Scared
Stiff in the bucket are the dime store robots
Like dead goldfish floating at the top
My grandfather's truck(trailer) in the great grey open pauses outside of a second hand shop
It's divine amnesia and the time lapsed friend
Leaving yet again
The very living end
An open crate missiles about 1 am
Ringing where the new sky meets the old stem
Holes in the sky line the black hole will burn
Cause all the train songs are only four bars returned
And like a missing nine on a neon price
I watch for the power to run out on the moon

Do humans really change like my mother's maiden name?
A divorce or two and it's back again
White kids with tongues like tracing paper
Pairs of baggy pants and brand new walkman
Are still kids like we used to be
And light stained glass
Will shine through

(we're not party people
We're just animated puppets who can even see the screen and now are young faced crutches
We're not party people
We're just animated puppets and despite all these songs
Love is still tugging
Love is still tugging)

We're not party people
We're just lonely on weekends
We're not party people
We're just lonely on birthdays
We're not party people
We're just lonely in big crowds
We're not party people
We're just lonely tonight

I am not zen, I'm calm like a city killer with poison oak waiting patiently by the lake to be saved
Our cutout friends so cutout, so cutout, so cutout
Save yourself
