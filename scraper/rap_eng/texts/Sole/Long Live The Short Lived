[Intro: Ceschi]
Nobody quite understood
Andy Kaufman's finest jokes
Even years after
All the cancer chewed away
Carmen Miranda's
Heart attack on the Durante show
Wasn't noticed until she
Faded the next day
When all our flesh disintegrates
We'll perform for the worms
Although the crowds will be letdowns
At least we'll still perform

[Verse I: Ceschi]
When you rub your eyes too hard and see spots
Those are only angels
Mixed with souls of the faded famous
Still putting on shows inside of a limbo dearly departed
Taken from a life early on
These trifling swan songs
Don't last long
The remains only stay
In an eardrum coffin
Lost in dense fog
It's funny but it's dead wrong
To pluck the gray hairs
Right out of a corpse's beard
And make a mask out of insignificance
Lingering around the stratosphere
So throw your fists up
For the fossilized apostles
Climb all over the graves of giants
To make yourself feel close to Colossal

[Hook: Ceschi] x4
Long live the great short lived
They all lived well

[Verse II: Sole]
I show that wear and tear on my face
And my clothes I wear, they tear
Cause I'm old like where my tears fell
In a cauldron
The elders stoned to death
In World War 1
On french battlefields
The avant-garde always died first
Die depressed, the way its gotta be
Down by booze
Clowned by shallow fools
Bitten by piranhas in shallow pools
I'm on a shadow run
Sippin 'my glass
And for them I'm always tipping my glass
It's half empty
Mostly gas
But its still a drink

[Hook]

[Bridge I:Sole]
Rest in a lost cause
Find no peace in a fresco
Nobody loves you like worms do
Show you the light like holes do
[Bridger I: Ceschi]
So rest in peace with musical pieces
Rotting around the guillotine
All of us remember something significant
But you weren't part of the final equation

[Bridge I: Sole]
[Bridge I: Ceschi]

[Bridge II: Sole]
And that’s dirt
You can't go deep without discovering a body
In cities you can't go deep without discovering a body
You can't go deep [x4]

[Bridge II: Ceschi]
The one man band it broke up
Before the world got choked up
Before anyone noticed, he dissolved into smoke and dust
The one man band it broke up
Before the world got choked up
And the few friends he gathered
Scattered ashes mixed with coke bumps

[Verse III: Sole]
We all know the drive is far
When the tongue weighs a ton
Although they don’t understand me
I carry a speech for when the Grammy's won
Torches don't get passed, they go out
The winner dies of dementia
And artists draw no pension
Its pecking your eyes while you're trying to read
Be the one to murder your faith while you're trying to believe
But don't fret
We all go down but look better in flames
It means nothing if only the tombstones remember our names
Only by pissing in the wind will you know the way its going
And only our fallen comrades know the true definition
(Of revolution)
Only by pissing in the wind will you know the way its going
And only our fallen comrades know the true definition
Of revolution

[Bridge II: Ceschi] x2

[Sole: overlapping Bridge II: Ceschi]
The bigger the giant
The harder it falls
It's simple physics idiots
The bigger the knife
The bigger the scar
