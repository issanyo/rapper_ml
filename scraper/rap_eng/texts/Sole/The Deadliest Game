[Verse 1]

Starcraft II beta tester
PhpBB administrator
ACF2 mainframes
I was on the block fuckin' dudes up at the club
Going home and playing Sim City
Who's more D&D than me?
On some RIFTS shit, some Heroes Unlimited
My comic collection is vast but I still got laid in highschool
No making lovesongs for Princess Leia
I take this as serious as I did my level 80 hunter
Back in the day I'm still a PvPer, got no time for PvEers
Only quest I'm on is to be the best rapper alive
And if I can't be that I'm taking nerd rap back

[Hook] Trapped in a deadly video game, with just one man

[Verse 2]

Quantum physics TED talk subscriber
Harpers index committed to memory
All my arguments are settled on Wikipedia
My mushroom trips are pixelated
Got three laptops, two smartphones
My first psychic experience involved Zelda
Best show of all time: Battlestar Gallactica
I'm the Adama of rap but a plague killed all my crew members
I no longer rap in bumperstickers; I rap in Javascript banners
My dogs wear camoflague; red and blue bandanas
Was disappointed by Hollywood's Aliens Vs. Predator
I'm on strike against the History Channel's UFO documentaries
Same shit for ten years
Give me exopolitics or show me exoplanets
Get me an Amazon.com gift certificate for Christmas
I want to scuba dive and get the feeling I'm no longer on this Earth
How does fermentation work?
Why is my sky black and your sky blue?
I read the CIA psychic spy book put out by Stanford Research International
Lost my mind to miracles of the mind, now I'm a materialist
Give me reality, or give me money, or throw me some gold when you see me in Shathrath city

[Hook] I'm trapped in a deadly video game, with just one man

[Verse 3]

I'm down with Zecharia Sitchin, I find the twelfth planet possible
Obsessed with apocalypse 'cos my Mom was waiting on Atlantis
In my youth, but I was younger then
I'm still ready to be holed up and live out my Malcolm X fantasies
I was the first American to beat Final Fantasy
Three days straight, pissing in Arizona tea bottles
My Mom said exercise
Little did she know, I'd grow up and become:
The Lawnmower man
At age 18 I ran a Real Audio server in my bedroom
Had a radio station, my own call letters
I sleep to TCC lectures, it's what my dreams are based on
Got teary-eyed at the end of Endymion
And everyone is locked in their room, all you can do is hear me out
I read post-modern philosophy to cheer me up
I've read the Rama series, every Hyperion book
And most of Arthur C Clarke's work
I don't play first-person shooters, but that's me
All my dreams look like Mass Effect and Fallout 3
Who else kept mudskippers, coral reefs in my studio
And learned the name of every bug that he's seen
If I was nerd rap I'd talk about the economy
The benefits and downfalls of nanotechnology
And if you've got beef, catch me online, we'll see who's the nerd
And get served, Zerged, and sent back to the 'burbs
