"i tippy-toe across your dream each night
So as not to wake you."

Sole:
Odd mannerisms, strictly cultured
With a compilation contorted jigsaw puzzle
These shoes were made to tip-toe through and leave a mark
This is the starting point for all my future works
Before deep puddle, i was a bead of inspiration
Now i get an iceberg slim human piano slash orchestra
Playing myself for all my favorite enemas
Everything cons, study, and miniscule minds
Take the time to be a better part

"i tippy-toe across your dream each night
So as not to wake you."

Alias:
That voice, that voice is my constant awakening on the hour
Every hour i spring to a 90 degree angle in a cold sweat
Returning to that not so comfortable self-esteem, it's next to nothing
Non-existent security tugs at my soul
And makes me think more about my self-worth
I splash water on my face to try and wash away my disconnections
This infection is killing me slowly
Slip back in my slumber only to hear it once again

"i tippy-toe across your dream each night
So as not to wake you."

Slug:
Awoken to self, chokin' a bad dream
No vaccine but to stare and breathe the air
Vision the pattern to listen to my woes
And i suppose to burst reaction 'til the thirst for answers
Lanterns and lightbulbs, cycles to cover
The odors of lost lovers' aromas
Hang loose like the coma induced
Produce seduction and found my true function

"i tippy-toe across your dream each night
So as not to wake you."

Sole, alias, and slug:
Multiple personalities, a four-headed beast
Caught in between a brief freedom release
As lost as your cause, walking through water and walls
Until we crash and desolve and martyr our flaws

Sole:
It ain't all love, it's confusion and a waste of time

Alias:
It ain't all love, it's confusion and a waste of time

Slug:
It ain't all love, it's confusion and a waste of time

Sole, alias, and slug:
It ain't all love, it's confusion and a waste of time

Sole:
It ain't all time, it's confusion and a waste of love

Alias:
It ain't all waste, it's confusion and some time to love

Slug:
It ain't all confusion, it's love and some time to waste

Dose one:
It ain't all that...it's all of the above...
So...scared into this, and you are
And you wonder from the shores how deep the puddle is. wet...
