Cookie Jar Jaws 2 the sequel, the lawn holes (8x)
Back, like hold back

I never chew with my mouth open, I'm hoping you can read between the lines I borrowed from someone else
Little bit of style stuck in between your incisors, implied supervisory, swallow the knick-knacks you borrowed from the shelf
It's a xeroxing world and everyone should open wide and close their jaws......
I bit biting from biting the biting biters....now pause

[Pedestrian]
It's the incredible melting man, himself, in person;
Godless and bored, apolitical, an unemployed miracle worker
Garbage-eyed oracle, pickpocket preacher, vacuous, disposable, and "absolutely modern"
By the way, I bit this immortality from the age of reproduction
Printed with the proper paperback book binding glue made from Bill Blake's horses of instruction

[Sole]
I invented ground so could break it and throw it in your eyes
By the way NASA bit space from the Aztecs
Who broke the spokes of the reinvented wheel?
Spoke to the followers who spat at the window
Had your chance, roll it down, just pass by casually
I learned to bite from my teachers who were biters

[Doseone]
I got senses and I know how to use 'em
I'm a user and both my parents wore glasses
A house housing it, ignoring the kinks in the mechanical haircut
Seeing as being Adam's been done
Thank god parameciums repeat themselves
Thank god parameciums repeat themselves
I bite like a rat with wings

[Pedestrian]
I'd like the public to know that I'm a poet first and would be assassin second

[Doseone and Alias]
I really like words like through, because there's threw, through, and through

[Sole and Alias]
You know there?s three types of people in the world;
The ones that go to the meetings, the ones that wait outside of the meetings, and the ones that wait for the phone call

[Sole and Doseone]
Hey, what are you doing, what are you doing... that's mine!

[Pedestrian]
Never been a lone gunmen in this open-air mezzanine
Reenacting the murder of Lennon for an audience of victims
Rewriting my song for meadow creek entitled "A Long Walk in the Rain"
I bit it from spring mornings; where's my Greek choir?
"What can you expect?
I bit this birthmark from all over Europe, and I'll be a dead white man one day too

[Doseone]
The thumb tree grew a hand plant from the people seed
And one of the George Washington's did over a hundred and something things with a peanut
Plus bikes are for lemmings and racers
We made it
You heard it first
Why, I practically bit this from golf!

[Alias]
I'm just taking a sample for scientific study
I'll bring it right back when I've drained it for all it's worth my buddy
I'll sing songs, paint pictures, write poems and do a dance and chuckle to myself as I file it under "inspiration"
Oops...I forgot it in my other pants
You didn't really need that did you?
I bit that excuse from this guy I once knew

[Sole]
When I'm angry, bite my tongue- when uninspired bite my nails
Sometimes I talk out loud, mostly I learn to talk when spoken at
And these buildings dare mock me?
For not building with them
But this castle is for them
I'm kinder to the peasants, bite me I look Irish
There is no obvious influence- I bit that from my parents

[All]
We've broken our fingers but never naturally
We've broken our figurines but never the natural law (4x)

Better artist, harder bite (4x)

The better the artist the harder they bite (8x)
