[Verse 1]
Banks are made of marble with a guard at every door
Vaults are voids where credit finds its first form
Credit snake like lines suck zeros to an end
Absent of the human lives by which they were spent
The transfiguration of an ashen Adam Smith
On the crush corn of any market intent
Even the extend song the first line was lifted from
Green banks and turns seven tomes silver sums
Fat will be born by the pull of market force
Our lives flash dimly cross it's marble face
Banks are made of marble with a guard at every door
Me I tend to time vault and mornings

[Hook]
Banks are made of marble with a guard at every door
In the walls there are no silver

[Verse 2]
A gun with a god enthralled to its wake
A one legged veteran parading in place
He lunch breaks outside in an open city square
That a horse cop watches though a stone froze veil
It's only a matter of military time
On an ATM cut into the side of a shopping mall
Ringed by rent-a-cops
It's a ghost town banks own whole living blocks

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
To see the iron meth
In the fainen seem
Or the world bank in the deed in a stem
Hold the great wing span of business hours spent
In a cold palm of a coin
A stampede on death
Thread the silver stands of a low loan interest
And set the sudden rome in the decades rip the flesh
Allienda walslapulmudna while banks iced on the front line of investor confidence
Banks are made of marble with clouds cut and died a god named the door a safe box rots inside
Banks are on the black holes and blooming lines go
To be lost rap with the ash of a god song
Bright blue armys in gas masks gaze a line
This rhyme might be fixed but at least it can't be bought

[Hook]
