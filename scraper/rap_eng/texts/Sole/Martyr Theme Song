[Intro]
Greetings, everyone
I am Sole
You know, Sole and Moodswing9, Live Poets and, uh, the blah blah blah
I'd just like to get a chance to clear my name
You know, I've been dubbed many things, you know
But I'm not a martyr
Some things are worth it
'Nothing is easy' is an overstatement
I'm too young to know it

[Verse 1]
I'm ultimate, permanent, learning 'til terminated
Age insighting visions, major human stage
This religion is my vice, my best friend
My knife, my security quilt (your quilt?) Excessive
Built from adolescence, built to escape
Built and then raised this idol that is picked to fix the gated mantle
Holding it all 'til I burst limestone, primestone
I am home, everywhere my soul scrape
And shakes the air that we breathe
My palms black all the way, I refuse to bloody my knuckles
And bruise my shins on giant steps over little people
Poking out these extremities into my Van Gogh
The complicated siren song'll do my jingle
All of these ideals with which I've grown to strangle
There's a fine line, I walk on the other side
I've only got one reason not to die
So as long as my blood runs the color purple
I am penetrating, choosing sides, allies, and weapons
I only see in black and white, there is no art of war
The beauty of is that scars make me a better man and victories make me weak
Stalemates from pushovers, so don't push me
'Cause I've been there, so let me win again (why?)
'Cause all these victories make me
That's why

[Chorus]
Everything is worth fighting for
Violence never got me anywhere
Free thought doesn't cost that much
Living is the only thing worth anything
Everything is worth fighting for
Violence never got me anywhere
Free thought doesn't cost that much
Living is the only thing worth anything

[Verse 2]
In the second grade, I was passed a note that read nothing is given
And everything was made to be taken
And I was made to learn trials by error, trailing the air
Climbing down from stairs, echoing my 'I won't give up'
Tongue claimed while you can't stop this
I can't go on anymore, it's your false
Sense of nobility
For spitting my blood in your face before my body dies
It's a casting in everything I believe
And I'm a bitter cynic
All truth is personal, I believe in myself, people have fought invention
Built to only slow you down, let you down, and try to be down
So I'm up, armed with two fists, gritted teeth
And an honesty only shared with the dumbest of martyrs finishing beef
I plead my, 'how ya like me now?'
Until I hate myself for being right and acting right
It's my god-stolen right to only live for lies and die for what I believe
Spitting in the face of opposition
Raise the consequences with open arms and closed eyes
Tensing every abdominal muscle, preparing for the inevitable invasion
Damn we're dedicated, and dammit, the devistation
For I understand what it means to hate
That's why I love with a passion that burns bridges

[Chorus]
Everything is worth fighting for
Violence never got me anywhere
Free thought doesn't cost that much
Living is the only thing worth anything
Everything is worth fighting for
Violence never got me anywhere
Free thought doesn't cost that much
Living is the only thing worth anything

[Verse 3]
And I've never met anything worth the beating of alieving
'Til I find myself, I've been here the whole time
Ever since then, I live for so-called friends as respective allies
And soon-to-be enemies
If you're not for, you're against, pro or con
And sidelined is an oxymoron, stupid
I've got a big mouth, a big heart, and a thick head
And I'm not afraid to use 'em

Bridges were made to burn
Idols were made to fall off pedestals
I'm only here temporarily, barely make a mark
It all starts with a stone
Bridges were made to burn
Idols were made to fall off pedestals
I'm only here temporarily, barely make your mark
And it starts with a stone

[Chorus/Outro]
Everything is worth fighting for
I am Sole
Violence never got me anywhere
He is Moodswing9
Free thought doesn't cost that much
Anticon
Living is the only thing worth anything
Everything is worth fighting for
I am Sole
Violence never got me anywhere
He is Moodswing9
Free thought doesn't cost that much
Anticon
Living is the only thing worth anything
