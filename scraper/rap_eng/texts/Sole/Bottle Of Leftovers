Epilogue read I'm not redoing it, I'm overdoing it
The bottle is now cracked and no longer crying
It's not in my nature to make apologies
Anticon finally hired me
No application is necessary, I'm looking for someone to move me

The winding path from Mount Caucus to Mount Olympus has been nothing short of usually amusing
Let the magazines speak the gospel and sing loudly in the right places of worship
You wanna know where I stand?
It's in a cloud over there, and no that's not rain

In the tradition of the broken mold I offer you pieces of my sanity
This is act 3 of my favorite movie
I don't care who can serve me
I don't care to be compared with anybody
We grew up on the same edutainment Public Enemy
Look I can still rhyme. Aren't you proud of me?

Please keep our illegal MP3's off your FTP or I will contact your ISP
Please visit www.anticon.com, the chatroom is funny
Please don't pick arguments with me, I haven't the energy
Shallow threats and knives kill me

Don't say my name unless you wish to spread it
A rap record is only as good as the person or push behind it

Bottle of Humans
Select your poison
The rest has been made easy for you
