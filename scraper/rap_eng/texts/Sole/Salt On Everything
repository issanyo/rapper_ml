Seven thousand day cough...

Seven thousand day cough, my lungs of an old woman
Of a racist race called man, I'm a word machine
Without enough words to be composed or the worms to decompose
My old song body, pretty, for the showing
Party women with painted faces
Only pretty for their lawyers, everything's illegal
'Cause they're pretending to breathe
Better to be sick in the head then sane in the city
Like there's a difference or a reason to stay in the city
Sell the mob to the king, sleep with the dragon
Slay the princess, lay peaceful in the nothingness
Laughing outside, my opinion permeates and lives forever

The way people live to be remembered
Then and only then, see me perfect
More perfect than the sidewalk
More expensive than my shoes
More meaningful than hidden messages
In a quite safe, quiet walk
You forget your personality when they birth
In the after-birth
I still fake it, like I'm naked
If you got the right sunglasses, I wrote this on cough drops
With the secret conveyor belt, in the sidewalk
And the big, laughing, gaping, drooling, lipsticked-up
And dressed like the lighter side of Death
Neon eyes, cold to the touch
And there's salt on (psssh)
Salt on everything
Salt on...salt on everything

Melt me a princess thought like an open wound
To bleed to sleep, to plead to work, to heal no loyalty
To things that don't keep clean
Wither my old tongue or old tone
To the man making all the new shadow puppets
I like your style more worthwhile then rubbish
A big break for bad taste, acting like faith is a face
A dumpster man singing a dumpster song of redemption
Share the broken note, it's the only note
People here got thick skin
To hold the nothing in
There's salt on everything, salt on everything, salt on everything
But I put it on nothing

Lick your merry lips off and hum it
All in a bowling alley
Headaches and hogwash going on in my ears
Dizzy dizzy infected of worry
It's never my body, my friends, my brain, or my fault to be stranded in a utopian wonderland
For three minutes I could sit still and stare at the wall and let it
(die)
This is my favorite mini-series, well-written, under-funded when it all dulls
A never-decaffeinated dream and I love a big bleeding heart song we can all learn
Some days we almost feel alive
And most days we forget to live
For some reason, that's all I can bring myself to say
You-know-what on everything
