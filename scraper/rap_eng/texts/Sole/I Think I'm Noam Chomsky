[Intro: Sole]
Man, you know what?
All you fucking George Mason University Graduates
Fucking valedictorians
Fucking, fucking boyfriends in the Army
Fucking bitter ex-Pats
You're right
You're right

[Hook 1]
Noam Chomsky
I think I'm Noam Chomsky
Dropped out of college
But I think I'm Noam Chomsky
My style is Al-Jazeera
Ya'll cats are CNN to me
Howard Zinn is dead
I must be Noam Chomsky

[Verse 1: Sole]
You're rapping about money
And ex-girlfriends
And who you serving
The ocean is rising
When the world ends
Who you serving?
Who you run with?
And what you running from? (History)
We're going into wars
And dying in the desert for empire
Lord, tell me this is worthless
Like Bob Dylan couldn't stop killing
In Vietnam
But in Afghanistan
Iran helped us overthrow the Taliban
So why we pointing missiles at the Ayatollah?
Bikini Atoll used to be an island
They blew up with nukes
Next day in France
They unveiled the bikini swimsuit
Half-naked empire
The Emperor is half-black
So in Hip-Hop I can only half-criticize
Big surprise: Pentagon announced
We might not leave after all
The Theater of War
I rap the desert of the real
(Baudrillard) covered the first Gulf War
From his hotel room
The war was waged on Saddam
But Vietnam Syndrome
CNN won and now here we are
On the fast-track to world domination
Neo-Liberalism
Ain't nothing humanitarian about "interventions"
You only go where there's natural resources
In the Ivory Coast
French troops are killing for chocolate
Villages burn
And UN fires over civilians
Meanwhile, we're picking sides in civil war
But more died in Syria than Libya
(That's the devil we know)

(Missing a phrase here. Help!)
Ain't nothing but straw huts and sand
Its a sham
Democratic war machine re-marketed
I'm ain't with it
(Think about it
If Bush did it
We'd be protesting
We can't let the UN fast-track it
And be king-makers
We gotta stay out the Middle East)

[Hook 2: Sole]
Noam Chomsky
I think I'm Noam Chomsky
Dropped out of college
Started reading Noam Chomsky
Twitter feed look like I'm ready for war
Vonnegut is dead

[Verse 2: Sole]
Do me a favor
Don't comment on my Facebook
If you disagree
Showing pictures of your abdomen
And Kardashian strippers
I'll take you on a Gaza Strip tour
Where you can get killed for
Being the wrong religion
In the wrong region
So lets get real
For every Israeli citizen that dies
Air strikes kill four people
Living in Palestine
Women and children dying
In the largest prison known to man
You can't call me anti-Semitic
I paid for those guns
And my Jewish friends who read the news
Must be anti-Semitic too
Besides Arabs are considered
Semitic people as well
So the Israeli defense forces
And Apache helicopters
Must be the biggest anti-Semites in the world
We manufacture the consent
The energy companies
Manufacture the bombs
Indirectly Time-Warner sold
Chemical weapons to Saddam
But that's old news
Like Gulf of Tonkin started Vietnam
And the Project for a New American Century
Needed 9-1-1
I'm wanted all over the world
Like US bases
They call me everywhere
But never in America
I'm Noam Chomsky
Apologists for war crimes say my views are communist
You show your ignorance
I'm an anarchist like Noam Chomsky
Vietnam vet
And they killed me in the jungle
Post-traumatic stress ain't covered
So whether you come home
In a box or a straight jacket
America don't love you
Economy's in the pits
Act like you have a choice
Rap like you got a voice
Fight back
Ain't no one gonna save us
Because when Chomsky dies
We're more alone in the wilderness
Surrounded by wolves
Limping towards our own irrelevance
I wrote this song in 20 minutes
It's easy
Bitch, I'm Noam Chomsky

[Hook 3: Sole]
Noam Chomsky
I think I'm Noam Chomsky
Dropped out of college
Started reading Noam Chomsky
My style is Amy Goodman
Ya'll cats are Glenn Beck to me
Howard Zinn is dead
I must be Noam Chomsky
