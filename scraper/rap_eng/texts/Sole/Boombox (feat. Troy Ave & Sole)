[Chorus: Female]
This is old School
Like a boom box
Sample that pete rock
This is old school
Like a boom box
Real life no boondocks
This is old School
Like a boom box
Sample that pete rock
This is old school
Like a boom box
Real life no boondocks

[Verse 1: Justin Hibbert [i]
Ya
Color cut clarity
Shipping diamonds back to Sierra Leone for charity
Blood on my wrist
Friday the 13th
Get with the program
Checks are cut on the 1st and the 15th
See you at the crossroads
My harmony got me a crazy bone
Smoked some weed now you acting old
My percentage is cheddar and wine
808's to 909
Killing these freshman
Columbine
This is torture
Rip it off the hanger
Stick it in your ass
Like ssssss
Thats a Method reference for you strangers
To Wu-Tang
Anime and Afros
This my paradise
Coolio
Topless hoe in a studio
Howard Stern
Turn on the Radio
Egyptian miss, Cleopatra
Silverman, Sarah
How could i be scared of you
When you scared of your mirror

[Chorus: Female]
This is old School
Like a boom box
Sample that pete rock
This is old school
Like a boom box
Real life no boondocks
This is old School
Like a boom box
Sample that pete rock
This is old school
Like a boom box
Real life no boondocks

[Bridge: Female]
Everybodys says they're so new
And i know it ain't true
I heard a million like you
It's better when they keep it old school

[Verse 2: Sole]
My boombox
Still plays fear of a black planet
Until we really live on a black planet
Baptist madness
Cause thats a fact
Cause my bi know gonna bankrupt us
You ain't real
Till you use your trust funds to buy blankets
For folks sleeping on the street
Cause uncle sam fucked us
Interacting with your brands
I mean bands
I mean the world is out of hand
Spinning through space
Till the only thing keeping your alive is
The desire for a selfie
We lived the lie
Not saying no real mc's got day jobs
They say real mc's punch up their girlfriends
Real mc's are in a mass grave
And they don't fall off to debt before their 2nd release
Thats the way of the world
Disposable youth
Thats why its 187 on everything we love
Motherfuckers
Or should i say fucker of the youth
Naw, fuck you
My boombox don't play
It strikes
And it's still on strike

[Chorus: Female]
This is old School
Like a boom box
Sample that pete rock
This is old school
Like a boom box
Real life no boondocks
This is old School
Like a boom box
Sample that pete rock
This is old school
Like a boom box
Real life no boondocks

[Verse 3: Troy Ave]
Count 100k in my tube socks
I move more base than a boombox
Box for the stash in the box porsche
When i say HP i don't mean horse
Harry got the power
Cause i got the powder
Fish scale sow
Seafood towel
Eating clams with my plug
Paid the bills
And i was handed the drugs
(gracia's)
Bueno's notches
A good day coming through for the hopeless
Break coming through
That don't mean that they smoke less
Jay got a coup
Imma get it wit progress
Re coup in the projects
Picking up weight like a Bo-Flex
My body built for this
I'm grinding with now no sex
Money over bitches
Get the bitches
With more Checks
Motherfuckers
