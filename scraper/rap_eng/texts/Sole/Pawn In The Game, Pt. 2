That's the come up
You either get down or you get up

The world is yours, everything they don't take
The skin is real, but the feelings are fake
I can lie myself to a retirement home
We're gods of bacteria 'til we dissolve
If I wake up crying, there's nothing wrong
If I wake up with you standing on my chest
I'll cut myself open and swallow you up
You wouldn't know love, you rent all your drama
And re-enact the happy endings all to yourself
If we walk the same plank and draw the same blanks
In empty space where people grow old
And I find these notes hidden under stones I turn...
This one says, "spawn some seedlings before the end of the world."
Call me back when you're alone
But I can't find the numbers or some space, some room to grow
Hope a room to think positive thoughts with someone else's decisions
Clap for a month like television lights
Changing channels on someone I tolerate
The last safe place out of my arms reach
That's my rich man's death bed where life is a comic book
My doctor's a comedian and tells me I'm dying
Like I don't already know, doc. where's my trophy?
I'm too sober for my own good
Dead to the world, 'cept my family and friends
You had your chance, now, this is what you do with it
Blow me away, blow me away, blow me away, blow me away
To another day, loc
'cause this feeling's getting doper than a motherfucker. that ain't no joke
I'm just a pawn in the game, a pawn in the game, a pawn in the game...
