Yes, sir!
It's on...haaa...

Now, what they do?
You know, it's big Sole, the fucking boss
My music's not for all, or it's all for naught
I bought that bear mace
I don't need a heater
I'll make the listener go pick up a Noam Chomsky Reader
I'm from the state of Maine; my swag is from 1870
And when I hit the West Coast, it's like D-Day
But I ain't from nowhere
Homey's a nomad
In the Rockies is where I'll wage my fucking jihad
And I ain't out to make a fair weather
Fuck a trophy
On the war getting dusty
I'm clever; don't trust me
Unstable; don't cross me
On a good day
You'll think I'm on the run
From the Homeland Security
Ripped so many words that I should learn to speak Sumerian
So when the aliens return to Earth, they'll be sparing him

And when they found me
They knew I wasn't gonna talk
They took my ACLU card
And whipped me real hard
But I don't got a lawyer
Or an agent for touring
I've burned so many bridges
They call me Ghengis Khan
My pen is never wrong
And it's always on me
The truth hurts the weak
So I'm never sorry
And if you saw me in my youth then you will see me now
White devil on the grind forged up in the depths of hell
I was emo before Kanye made a hipster album
And I never stole nothing that I couldn't turn a bomb from
Money's cool; I'm cooler
High road; no interpreter
No food; no problems
No problems; no music
Headache?  The twelve trillion conned
Blame the baby boomers
That's why I'm with the workers
Screaming "Feed us or shoot us!"

Call me what you want; I promise not to call you out
Let 'em run their mouths
Someone buy me a house
You're so played out
One on one
Serve your hate
This land isn't my land
You shouldn't exist, like USA
Best land's always solen
Same with albums, that's my problem
But it ain't nothing but more nails up in the devil's coffin
Push me out to sea; let's see who's really deep
And I know you're really, really shallow
I read your tweets
Some play dumb
Stay dumb stay down
Take your C4 and war planes
Bombing playgrounds
Until then I'll maintain
Channeling my inner demon
You'll catch me up in the kitchen
Steady silk screening
Tour shirts, even posters
Even the brokest among us are hard workers
So what the fuck is a hustler?

Two things worry me about the left.  First, it's more and more legalistic moralization, you know.  It's kind of a pure form of protest against unjustice, then the only thing you can do is legal forums, and so on.  In this sense, many of the ex-leftists are getting depoliticized.  They no longer ask the truly basic questions
