[Sole & Doseone]
Once upon a time
The tortoise and the ocean (the human and the sea)
Spoke and laughed on the day she ate itself
Tides swallow
Mountains drown
All structures
Species cleansed

[Doseone]
Hello my dear wall
As usual, cast enchanting in the sparkling pale dark moonlight
How has skull been treating you?
That's good
Who me?
Pebbles now of course
There's just well, us, we, my kind and I would
I wonder if they shouldn't
If they even deserve to share in continuity
Let alone eating of one in the same cycle

[Sole]
Say, God, I grow wary of watching my face shiver, they shake
Do you remember a child kicking you in the face
Slapping backs swallowing sitting and staring gaping up, sane
And try to bury intense with vocabulary
Yeah, children are animals
Sorry excuse for walking dog
Dog your talking, you're the 90 percent
The bay: you're the two and only too much I know me just like
You're the psyche, you're the cyclones
And we can build new homes in the sea

[Doseone]
You see
You're the mother, and we the animals your children
Who eat animals, which eat of plants, that need of sun
But need of you...
Your life giving weather is an awesome absolute body
It is your place to search fertile sink, settle, start the chain anew
I would only ask this once

[Sole]
Hey hey, I know a way..
Huff and puff, let's build, embark, dismantle this Rome
Foam at the mouth, it's been a long walk since primordial soup
Now they run amok, around, on solid ground
Assuming likenesses of trees
And pouncing, raping, and standing
I'll be smiling on the day they float
Let 'em sink, let 'em end, let 'em...
Make reefs and houseboats out of men

[Chorus - Sole & Doseone]
Once upon a time
The tortoise and the ocean (the human and the sea)
Spoke and laughed on the day she ate itself
Tides swallow
Mountains drown
All structures
Species cleansed

[Sole]
This circle is a breeding ground for the canyon
Pollution in death
(Doseone: I should know)
Too many unnatural sounds
And influential light making you, an inspirational seemed impossible
But I've watched that stay
Hollow lakes and displaced inhabitants like I
Get out of the mean habits of the really loved, you wide scraped sky
And escaped sea
In spite of what they mostly be
Hoping that their God will someday return
Every time the bar rolls I get more upset
Settling, suddenly under breath
Red crumble, rearrange ensemble
With a swift flow, galliant of galliants adapt
Humans and beautiful equivalents (duplicates)

[Doseone]
He's right
Dear mother, mom, what may, even
Grown to the edge of instinctive understanding of
Moreso, unwilling
We choose to learn to sacrifice nothing
And of your other creations chased, take a vigil
We die trying to hide from our dangerous selves
The unclean beast of women, hunt, full inquiry
The strictness of their bowels, the building of caves
And shot the sharp stones to kill better, in fact
They now run wild, they even poison land, aura, land
And you with its extract
Shamefully, apes win the cursed measured, apply and concentrate
Has in turn regressed, oh you've never seen such an evil vision
They even kill of their own kind to pleasure and gain
Please help them
Mean, in the name of fire, let your waves crash, amongst our breaths
Crash, and cure the air

[Chorus - Sole & Doseone]
Once upon a time

[Doseone]
I beg of you though, take me first

[Sole]
Oh please take him first so my last days can be spared
Of his arrogant ways and self-centred smile

[Doseone]
I cannot prove you otherwise, nor do I dare
To face a man, is a terrible terrible thing

[Sole]
Ever see a swimming tortoise?
We all in the same boat sinking, hopeless
'Cept I hope to see you stop existing

[Doseone]
You're so right, that's why I've come to push weak knees within the sand before you

[Sole]
In receded shore lines, life lines and light lines

[Doseone]
To lean dear mother, and plead dear mother
You take dear mother, our lives swarm back

[Chorus - Sole & Doseone]
Once upon a time
The shores and the lakes (the land and the sea)
Met and battled 'til the world became flat
Tides became mountains
And mountains swam
And the abyss rose to meet man (and the sea level rose to meet man)

[Outro - Sole & Doseone (at the same time) ]
And then were all leviathans (and the humans cannot understand)
And were all in such a hurry (and water ran)
And we realize were not as deep as we thought we were (and water drank)
And were all in too deep (and water killed)
And no man is really dry (and water saved)
And words like thirst suddenly lose all meaning (and water engulfed)
And they no longer overlook the sea (and became)
And they understand what it means to sweat (and the human began to understand)
And no one can tell (with its lungs filled and burst with waves)
And everyone is crying more (and laughter on the day she wept)
And no one can tell (and open to take down the fates into her rushing arms)
And the ocean spoke no more (and the sea spoke no more)
