[Sixtoo]
Blank page
Blank space between the space and Timex
Count down to nothing
No pop, no big bang theories of post modernistic expression The new impressions of devils and angels both
I stand silent

[Sole]
I dis-attached from my antennas up
Somehow I lost and missed the point
Hence the resting out on the lowest slight chance we'll make up the broadcast news at eleven
And maybe see some blood inside the city gutters

[Sixtoo]
And through the sewer drains
I feel the discontentment of the universal channel system that hasn't faded to blackness
Not yet
Yet not quite enough comfort to ease the swell vision of sporadic patience
For one moment that's passed

[Sole]
In an unnatural semi-neutral anti national loose cannon
Now swivelling awaiting for the happy heal giveaway
I spent my thanksgiving with a fork in my eyeball

[Sixtoo]
(and stabbed my motivation (?????))

[Sole]
Dying cast
Oh we're crying
It's the end of the night
Lying
I swear it ain't lying
It's the end of the world

[Sixtoo]
Staggered thought
Staggered dream time
As the seconds tick-tock
Staggered rotations corroding

[Bridge] [Sole & Sixtoo]
All aboard to those futuristic jump ships
Stop the idea, jump ship, jump ship
We're landing in the toughened glass body buddy finder
Community based whorehouse, public service reminder

[Sole]
Leave your impression if you're crying to rejoice
If he's to scream loud and (?) could have a broken fucking baby

[Sixtoo]
And the dancing baby blue eyed Jesus statue corrodes Because the Christmas lights have burned out the shells of the condos

[Sole]
And the still standing schoolyards block the smell of the fireworks

[Sixtoo]
And the mistletoe now stinks like a thousand miles of baby ass

[Sole]
And if the baby asks why it's cause she looks cute in the oven

[Sixtoo]
And that same community whorehouse can't provide affordable lovin'
Close bracket, end of idea
No end of the world has passed
Now we're suspended in animated ideas
Lost in travels of a distance not reached

[Sole]
Set up camp in the greatest sweatshop under any omnipotent beast

[Sixtoo]
And at least we'll have a broken Glock party to play with

[Sole]
Hence putting together for the giants
Drink out the thumbprints in silence
Happily snuffed out
Yet easily get slave under an empire of peasants

[Sixtoo]
So we were all left in a state of eternal entropy
And my sources indicate there was no ending of the century

[Hook][Sole & Sixtoo]
As strange as it may seem, nothing fell apart
As strange as it may seem, nothing fell apart
As strange as it may seem, nothing fell apart
As strange as it may seem, nothing fell apart
