[Sole]
One for the money two for no money
My dreams psychedelic nightmares
My team worms and burning bridges
See the light like Copernicus
They want to burn me, like the suns of Copernicus
They got nothing on me
Lyrics is Louis Vuitton belts
My style is straight jackets and suicide bomb belts
No more Tim dogging 'em
Bin Laden, I been rapping
Since the days in blue eyes
Got your head padded
It’s a small world, beware the pot you piss in
May be the one you drink from
The tree you plant today may be
The one you hang from et cetera
Everyday I’m hustling but I ain’t a middle man
Come see me when roc az got more guns than Afghanistan
I started this weird shit, now everybody wants to be normal
This shit rise to the top
That’s why no promo
This ain’t a mix tape
It's an I don’t give a fuck tape
It's high school revenge in a brief case
Who brought the duct tape
