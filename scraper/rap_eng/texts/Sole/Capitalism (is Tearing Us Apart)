I will work harder
I will work smarter
I will work stronger
I will work night and day
I will work better
I will work cheaper
I will work longer
I will work my life away

Hey DJ, play that hope
So motivational
Just gotta bootstrap up
Secret that fate control
Girl, I'm a shooting star
I'll do it on my own
Til I burn out and fall
(Capitalism's tearing us apart)

[Verse 1: Sole]
And I’m alright
I can’t say the same for anyone else
Ever since I was a kid
You taught me how to slit a throat
And make it feel like a kiss
You taught me the value of hard work
By sitting on your ass
While I sweated into french fry vats
Got a ten cent raise couldn’t live off that
Let’s go on a vacation
Hang out and eat hotel food
In a place that's equally destitute
As every other place we ever knew
Til they underwater Madison Avenue
Watch you drown in a Bangkok bungalow
There’s only one way to say I love you
Let me count the ways to say that we are doomed

I have to work late
I'm sorry that the food's gone cold
We'll fight when I get home
(Capitalism's tearing us apart)
Just strangers passing in the dark
Dreams sold to stay afloat
Pulled by the undertow
(Capitalism's tearing us apart)

[Verse 2: Sole]
And I’m not alright
But how can anyone ever be?
We’re all just one innovation away
From being made obsolete
So keep on rocking in your free world
But you don’t even know what that word means
The phrases “free” and “friend” are linked
Its root means “to be free” and “have ties”
A shared power that grows, selfless
Means I’m only free if everyone else is
These are the bootstraps you hang me with
As you watch the world burn
Through the window of a cruise ship
Keep it moving
Over the homeless people sleeping and the refugees fleeing
They might buy you off with a mansion on a prairie
Just don’t ask where the bodies are buried

Climb when you hit the wall
Dance to escape the coals
Grind til you lose your nose
(Capitalism's tearing us apart)
Out here it's doge eat doge
You're either pimp or ho
Throw the weak overboard
(Capitalism's tearing us apart)

Chained up through the phone
They won't leave us alone
Always one more straw
(Capitalism's tearing us apart)
Waiting for change to come
Like a John Mayer singalong
As we feed the machine our hearts
(Capitalism's tearing us apart)

Wave flags and rock the vote
Clap for the puppet show
Don't you dare cross the moat
(Capitalism's tearing us apart)
Eternal war and endless growth
Choking a finite globe
Oh girl where can we go?
(Capitalism's tearing us apart)
