[Sole]
Years ago on a caravan, my cover was blown
Now I roam confused, 'til my home is in the loam
Where the blackhawks hunt
Where I lost my gun, in the cavern of rust
Never on my knees when I'm on my back
Tell you where you could go, if I had the time
And since I don't, I pine the walls
Of piled up pills and, bad advice
And, outstretched arms can't catch the sky
Especially when, meteors they blacken your eyes
And I've been down, most of them roads
And left the bodies and forgot the codes
Nothing is sacred, everything is for sacrament
When nothing is left, pull out a camera then shoot yourself

[Hook]
Nothing's gonna peel the paint, nothing's gonna save your health
This song's about nothing cause nothing's gonna love you back
And nothing's gonna pay your rent... (this song's about n-n-n)
Nothing's waitin on you in the end
Nothing's gonna fix your life
Nothing's what you get when you're hungry

[Sole]
They can't paint me, my skin is a stainless glass
They can't, save up the pennies to pay me back
For the teeth I've lost, tried to out-at a dragon
For the life I've lived, tried to outrun the dragon in me
Pay attention to your feet while you scuffle the landscape
Disturb no flowers, step on no insects
Forget your powers, they useless here
People use to care, now they worship garbage
But these is recycled times we livin in
End of simple things, everything is everything now
Hold a cross to my head, if I had a God
Hold my cards to my deck, if I had a chest
Favorite books are waterlogged, my eyes are heavy
The lines get weightless
Only in space when the world is waking
You know you livin a dream by the was that you chase it

[Hook]
Nothing's gonna peel the paint, nothing's gonna save your health
This song's about nothing cause nothing's gonna love you back
And nothing's gonna pay the rent.. {*echoes*}
Nothing's waitin on you in the end
Nothing's gonna fix your life
Nothing's what you get when you're hungry
Cause nothing gon' bring the hunt
Ain't nothin gon' bring the hunt

[Sole]
They wanna know how I do it, I wanna know why I do it
I got my reasons like I got my demons
Although I play the devil he ain't got nothin on me
But a couple of years, a couple of rocks
Thought it was a puddle then got lost in a raindrop
And I still ain't hit Earth yet
Let me in I'm dry ice, trying to keep warm
I'm in a pattern of ghosts and chains and wolves
And you don't wanna see me bawlin, I mean cryin
I mean, puttin these thoughts into action
We all suffer from a lack of talent, a lack of patience
A lack of feedback when you're howlin in the vacuum
They say everyone's an expert after they go through it
You must be a failure if you're still in it
I say everyone's a failure, after they go through it
You're only a expert while you're still in it

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Nothing's gonna peel the paint, nothing's gonna save your health
This song's about nothing cause nothing's gonna love you back
And nothing's gonna pay your rent...
Nothing's waitin on you in the end
Nothing's gonna fix your life
Nothing's what you get when you're hungry
Cause nothing gon' bring the hunt
Ain't nothin gon' bring the hunt
