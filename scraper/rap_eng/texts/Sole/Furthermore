I'm fascinated with facts
In fact I own a sundry of knowledge to lay my feet on
The universe is my university
I read people by actions and mannerisms
Speaking in body language, thinking in tongues
Spitting game at sitting ducks
Sifting dry humor through stained glass and aqueducts
Oddly enough
I'm building monoliths in each millisecond, lingering on concepts
Fingering the translucent fabric of what I've become
And how I strum the strings they dangle from
Creating webs in this lucid tantrum, tangent
Symbolizing this foolproof play I've staged since the invention of the information age
A modern man built of mics, modems and motherboards
Down by lore, allowing kids like me a reason to press record
Maintaining a pressing issue, although everything I have always known has been depressing
Since thoughts are limited by language, and our speech has been limited by our sight
And since all I known is sound and see is color, everything I understand is compared to everywhere I've fed off
Plan to be a sawed off in the rifle closet I learn in against flickering images of artificial light
Spinning shadows into the absence of all I touch
Leaving imprints upon the populace

I've got further to learn than I've got to say
Furthermore, I'm never taking a step for granted
Nevertheless, I'm at odds with the fact that I'm just one character in a stage
Oddly enough, built to travel to the next page

All these scarlet letters and prying eyes sting better in dim times
Hummed sounds of crumbled paper find a nice comfortable warmth among
Closed lids, supported by the reasons to tear
To flames and burn
I may inhale the knowledge of those who slaved late nights by fake lights and burned wicks
Lives transcribed to parchment now computer screens
I'm a widowmaker of insolence, wisdom and machine
Metal tongue is my extension cord
I'm the silhouette of a Silicon Valley cobra snake reaching for words to taste
Translate tangents, walking the outer limits of language
Un-average, against the grain, so everything I know has been slanted
We sometimes speak not knowing what shall be exposed
I've learned not to gauge intelligence by pieces of paper
Chunks of change, or the age of foes
Insect by the way endeavors, the pressure on the mind, the highs and lows
Well lo and behold, my heart isn't in the right place
I wear it on my sleeve so I can press it to my white face
In this dry I heave every emotion contained in the Pandora's Box entitled "sole" (subtitled)
I extend my arm as an offering to read my palm
Shake my hand this helping hand this unseen hand
Thumbing through the ?, and bindings, and numbings of the pumpkin head's now glowing, and caving in
I am the light, the image that draws your stare
I am the dark, the absolute matter of air
I am positive energy
I am flame engulfing literature
I am sure, I am raising my arm
And lowering my guard my brow
My 21 decades of experience and evolution (It don't stop)
Constantly increasing these soliloquies muted, eavesdropping on the professor
Learning from the professor, becoming the professor
This magnetic earned aggressor
This basic model learned imposter is becoming the professor
Becoming and learning

I've got further to learn than I've got to say
Furthermore, I'm never taking a step for granted
Nevertheless, I'm at odds with the fact that I'm just one character in a stage
Oddly enough, built to travel to the next page
