On my way here, I saw a kite caught
In a power line. I say "caught," but
I like to think "perched," for what it's worth
Sometimes I'm so close to a phrase like
You know
'the blueprint of my soul,'
I just want to let the whole goddamned poem go
Maybe my old friend said it best
"We got struck by lightening
And it stuck in our chests."

"Why do we say we're bored to tears?
What are we mourning?"

In the dead of the day I turned ten
The Dow went black
And brokers fell from the sky
Into geometrical piles of pinstripes

About a month before I turned 24
Cabs with the backseats knocked out
Took bodies to an old Brooks Brothers
They'd converted into a new morgue

I want to live longer than your average Black Panther
I want to watch the gray trickle-paint my beard

I want to pen a novel entitled, 'The Held Sigh,"
I want to quit writing and moved to Arcosanti
And even sink i the same light lines I cut

In soiled suit, somebody's father dives
To catch a quarter rolling on it's side

Got a bum memory but got these raps...

Nah, yall do songs
I'm only snapping my fingers like I forgot something
