Grow strong homeless
Go on numbers, go on home
There's nothing to see except insults thrown at body of works
Felt it before, and during, and after re-occuring
Happening for a reason, I never regret
So I'll never be sorry enough to earn back the respect
I'm a broken record, playing out a broken dream on shitty speakers
Man it sucks to be myself and hurts to bite the lips
It kills to think they say I'm becoming something else
Yet I feel the same
And dirty, and guilty and alone
And needing to acknowledge that I need no approval
Here I am again at square one who am I and who are they?
Consuming all of my time, this ain't hip-hop
But I'm supposed to be a rapper
Why did I make this place?
I'm far away from home and I have no home
Why did I come to this place?
Far away from home and I have no home

So I sleep under papers and talk to myself in public places
I stagger and twitch, and drive a 400 dollar car
I'm taking it on the road again, this time I'm never coming back 'til I'm dead
Pour another keg
Shake my leg it's broken
That's my name run it through the mud I still remain
A beast, a mountain of moss purging all the stagnance
This stage is the saddest place I've ever been
Let this be a lesson
Let us be cheapened
Let's not be the lesser
Let's beat around the bush 'til my brain rots, and apples fall
And everybody indulges and enjoys, and maybe dies of cancer
We all gotta go, it's all gotta go, and I've changed my mind again
I'm not gonna go out like I should
For I'm so humbled, I have no shame, many dignities
An inability to simplify
So throw things, I'll catch them, and hopefully in time you will too
Let me breath for you, you're choked up and afraid to show it
I'm a person, not a poet and it's wack to rhyme poet with show it
But see it's obvious I can't change and I'm not finished
But I live in this space so give that much to me
The freedom to be in a space
A space like my own air
Heir to no one's throne

La la la this song is not a message
Arrogant people make me
Silent people interest me
Why can't anybody leave me in peace?
Why bother?
Brothers, sisters, orphans, and dolphins
No one person is that special, we ride the short bus to oblivion
Living in a commune
It's a small rock we're standing
I wanna understand, I need to lay down
The background moves so fast it's hard to see the faces of my loved ones
But their voices I follow and somehow end back in the same place
'Til everything stops
And nobody's there, and I'm walking down the street mumbling over the sound of my footsteps echoing off;
Looking for a place to lay my feet
But nobody's home

Nobody's home, excuse me sir, nobody's home
