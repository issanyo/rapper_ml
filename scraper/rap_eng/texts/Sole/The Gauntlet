[Verse 1: Sole]
Let me tell you who I am
Let me find out first
I wanna be a new human like born in Greece
Really it ain't happen yet
Cuz the new ones resemble the old ones
I used to rap like what's the meaning of life?
Like a fucking nineteen year old white rapper knows the meaning of life
And if that had a meaning it'd be
You ain't shit but a bundle of nerves held together by gravity
If you live in fear don't speak my name
Had a chance to run with the bulls and you hid with the sheep
You thought you were sane but they killed you anyway you just don't know it yet
I'm dead too but in a different way
Cuz crimes against totality pays are like indie rap tours slay the psyche
Talking 'bout the good ol' days I never had in the industry trenches
All I did was dodge bullets that were more like paper airplanes
I was young but old at the same time
I didn't even have a heart but it still broke mine
When I needed a mentor I had haters
And when I needed help I had pointed fingers

[Hook]
We run the gauntlet
Oh yeah we run the gauntlet
We run the gauntlet
Until we run the gauntlet

[Verse 2: Sole]
Render under the body
What belongs to the bodies
Till the stars in our eyes
Look like shock and awe
When I die I hope every Adam Curtis documentary flash before my eyes
Hope I see zen and my grandma like what up
That'd be my last fantasy
Before I blink into worms
And the things we tell ourselves to deal with death are all lies
But no worse than the ones we tell ourselves to deal with life
In rotation flow with the city feels natural
Yet it's multidimensional chopped up broken flows
Broken windows
Inhale the smoke and windows
They say all raps about the same thing everything
At the same time describes nothing
All around concrete fills the sky
The sky feels like a flood of radio waves
Giving me nightmares I can't remember
Wake up sweating and screaming but I'm still dreaming
I never had friends till we stood against riot cops
And they ask me now who I am? I almost know
But only electric chairs and cameras watching cameras tell our tales
This speeds a lie detector test snitches get stitches
The futures unwritten in black paint
Just cuz that ain't been done don't mean we can't
You in the building
We in the forest
And you should join us

[Hook]
