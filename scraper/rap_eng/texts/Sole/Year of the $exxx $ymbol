June 11th, saturday, we were laughin', 1 year later
It took me 21 years to make this album
But i did 3/4ths of it in the last 2 weeks
Notebooks after phone calls, cars lined up to be extinguished in the office place
Embarcadero is the biggest mauseleum imaginable
This house can't stay clean
Too many superstars on the rug, too many tags on the fog on the mirror
This is it, and i can see them when i see me
Reflection is relative, nothing can be finished by then
These phone bills pile up, forgotten half of the convos anyway
Sole is idol worship, these songs are all different sides of me
I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing
But this is cleansing, a baptism in babylon
A broken bottle of humans where idiosyncrasies are fiestas
It's party time, and i forgot my hip-hop hat
Cut off all the heads quietly naked screaming for attention
Used to wear my ego as a sweater
Now it's the cape that follows me throughout the atmosphere
Keep your eyes to the ground, swallow your pride
Talk to the voices in your head
How did the alarm get 2 hours ahead?
It's been like that for a minute, my hands are dirty
And somehow i manage to separate that from the keyboards and melodies
That swallow up my fantasies
Smoke on these phrasings, i don't wanna be amazing
Just leave me, so i can record album number 6 next month
And always remain inspired

I'd promise the outro but i don't want to spoil the moment
I'd promise the outro but i don't want to spoil it...

I picture chubby deaf girls dancing in a black and white freeze frame
I hear galaxies as communities i shall never see
Oh no, it's those creatures with the big heads and eyes and they're coming for me
I think of pages and lots of light beaming from an unseen source
I'm more like these giants making bouquets
The bullet just entered and she's entering pain
It don't rain, it splatters, that's why my data remains after the pain
Don't blame me if all my songs sound the same
I'm a product of envy and turmoil roller coasting insane
Trying to change the world 5 pages at a time
Calling green lights stops signs, it's all aura laborious
My aura and story is static like clouds are sculptures
Humanity is too much cotton candy
Here's some food for thought indigestion decompose
We compose, here's another patented product for your collection
Language is action packed, come on let's picnic
And nitpick between factions, fact, fiction and mineral
Drink well, the cactus and appearing in the centerfold
Sink fast, the uprise goes on without us
I'm all ears, all here, blind to you and your puppeteer
Everyday is Truman Show
True men show their face and expose flesh
Who made the cut?
My pen is the sax, so the horn blows the grand scheme. relax

I'd promise the outro but i don't have any time
I'd promise the outro but this is only the beginning...

Sole is the protocol, sex symbol, fly on the wall
This a pre-emptive strike, match struck
Awestruck beyond comparison, white collar barbarian
Telling the librarian; these are the papers to bury the sky
It's liquid time, bring in styrofoam cups filling outside of the lines
These are scribbles for an older exhausted pulse
It's the return of the never been there
Give me 5 minutes I'll melt your 12 dollars you stupid coke crackhead cupids
Milking the earth for what it's worth, with my family or single handedly
This hand breaks things, this hand molds things
Son I'm in my own shadow
The mold that breaks the glass
Your ears are my walls and these are mere paragraphs
Follow the architect, sure we're erecting art and texture
Now Sole is only human, enjoy my imperfections
Put a red dot on that, slaughtering articles
Pen and pixeling particles
Here's your entry, posing makes participants feel practiced, so keep them skills dull
I bang symbolism off doldrums and still spare minutes
Check my postcards these are letters from god
I've been practicing this face for centuries
These are acts of pretension
I've been practicing this face for centuries
How you like my grill?
How you like my smile?
I've been practicing this face for centuries and i'll be like this for a minute
