[Verse 1]
Give me a hell of a day -- I deserve it
It feeds my fire
Not the one that was stolen from a greek god
But fire
Built from man and brings on
Oh the fire
Some day that will kill all lawyers
The fire
That burns in every man's death pan
The fire
That destroys what addiction can't kill
It shakes the earth
And causes tsunamis
Good fire fights bad fire
In california fires symbolize this first
When nature waged its little war on us
So we fought back
Not with sticks
Not with stones
Not with poems
Its the reason [?]
In the winter when I'm camping
It keeps me calm
I burn a city down to stay warm

[Hook]
Bridges stay burning

My name was a killer word
Even in ice age
My name was a killer word

[Verse 2]
The first brand was was put on the cattle
The second brand was name
And then it was put on us
My favorite brand is apple
Given from a snake to a girl
And she chose a man
For eternity
Now all he sees is smoke
He doesnt need a watch
He shine now
He's once clothed
But all he needs it a match to be a man
One must escape the [?]
[?]
I'll pass you the the torch
Only if you promise never to get it wet
Then we'll be forced to start the whole thing from scratch
Throw your lighters up
That fire will feed you or kill you
Oh no lighters?
Throw your cellphones up
Make that room glow with that fire that keeps us close
Too close for comfort
Some might say distant
Phones were made for talking are made from the tasks of elephants[?]
Sshhiit
When I was a kid we told stories around the fire
Mark my words that this is the last story told in fire

[Hook]
Bridges stay burning

My name was a killer word
Even in ice age
My name was a killer word
