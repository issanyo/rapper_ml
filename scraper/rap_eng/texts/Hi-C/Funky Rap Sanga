[Verse 1]
It’s me, Hi-C, your funky rap sanga
When it comes to singing songs, oh yes, I got a gang-a
Shit I like to talk, some shit I like to sing
Like “yep, you’re on my dick-dick-ding-a-ling”
Hey baby, maybe you can get it going
With a young nigga that be knowing and growing
‘Cause when I’m in a relationship, I like to go slow and hey
Hey, I take my time when I’m hoeing
And when I walk out the door, it’s like punching a clock
Yo, I don’t sing pop while I’m rocking your cot
So baby, gap your legs wide open
And if you dare, prepare to get stuck by a Trojan
Yep, that’s good stickin’, so baby, get to lickin’
Nah, I ain’t kiddin’ and I ain’t bullshittin’
With a rubber, that’s the only way that I fade
‘Cause fuck that shit, I ain’t about to catch AIDS
If you think moms can hang, nigga, you could bang her
Long as she don’t fuck with Hi-C, the funky rap sanga

[Chorus]
Hey, rap sanga, hey
I’m your funky rap sanga, hey
Hi-C, the rap sanga, hey
I’m your funky rap sanga, hey
Rap sanga, hey
I’m your funky rap sanga, hey
Hi-C, the rap sanga, hey

[Verse 2]
Now I’ma diss the bitches that got one braid
‘Cause those the type of hoes that’s only out to get paid
Niggas, watch your ass and your cash, they’ll take ya
A dulo hoe, the bitch is only out to break ya
I trick a tramp, I’ll fuck her in the guts
And after I’m finished fuckin’, I’ll fuck her ass up
Now, bitch, say what? Put your clothes on
And if you take too long, I bet you’ll catch the damn bus home
Gave her a couple of minutes, said, ‘Fuck it,’ I broke out
It’s 2 o’clock, she’s at the bus stop looking smoked out
The only damn way she’d get picked up
If she come and eat a big fat dick up
I like to fuck it, I never suck it
I stick my balls into her mouth and she’ll love it
I push my dick way up her mouth until it reach her fuckin’ throat
I get to strokin’ and a pokin’ until it’s broke
And if you think aunt can hang, nigga, you bring her
Long as she don’t fuck with Hi-C, the funky rap sanga

[Chorus]
Hey, rap sanga, hey
I’m your funky rap sanga, hey
Hi-C, the rap sanga, hey
Rap sanga, hey
I’m your funky rap sanga, hey
Hi-C, the rap sanga, hey
I’m your funky rap sanga, hey

[Verse 3]
Now, niggas don’t trip, this a bitch cut
‘Cause I’m looking for the hooker with the big butt
So I can bust me a big ol’ great nut
In a little ol’ skinny ass fat slut
Now some girls like to trip ‘cause I’m 17
But I rip it damn good, so what the hell that mean?
I just push all up in ‘em like some ice cream
And while I’m pumpin’, she be hummin’ “Oh, king”
Now some women like to hug, some women like to kiss
Some women like to grind, while others suckin’ dick
See, I’m light-skinned, weigh about 155
I’m short with long hair and I love lickin’ thighs
No, there’s no surprise, and if you wanna cum
Just run up on Hi-C and just get some
If your grandma wanna hang, nigga, you can bring her
Long as she don’t fuck with Hi-C, the funky rap sanga

[Chorus]
Hey, I’m your funky rap sanga, hey
Hi-C, the rap sanga, hey
I’m your funky rap sanga, hey
Rap sanga, hey
I’m your funky rap sanga, hey
Hi-C, the rap sanga, hey
I’m your funky rap sanga, hey

[Outro]
Yeah, shout goes out to my man, Super Fly
My man Tony A. , DJ Quik, 2nd II None
And that crazy nigga AMG, Big Breed
Yeah, we doin’ it, y’all, yeah, yeah
Let me hit a note
