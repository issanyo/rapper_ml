[Intro: Hi-C]
Right about now, I’d like to dedicate this to all of the Compton hoochies, you know
Hi-C’s in the house with 2nd II None
Sing along like this, you know, Compton style
Come down like this, you know
Come here, say…

[Chorus: 2nd II None + (Hi-C)]
Take me to Compton where the hoochies come from (Right)
Take me to Compton where the hoochies come from (Follow me now)
Take me to Compton where the hoochies come from (Yep)
Take me to Compton where the hoochies come from

[Verse 1: Hi-C]
Some smart, some fat, some ugly, some dumb
Take me to Compton where the hoochies come from
‘Cause just the other day, me rolled down the ‘Crans
Me seen a big ass in the biker pants
Me pulled to the side, me have to take me chance
She got a fat monkey, boy, look how she stand
With no time to waste, me push her inside
Come here, say, Hi-C take you on a long, long ride
Me don’t have no money, me can’t go hotel
Me take her to the beach, she said “That’ll be swell”
And ever since the girl got in me car
Me lose me self-control and now me dick is on hard
She said that she loved me, she called me her man
Me cock open her legs, boy, and her ass hit the sand
Me was all up in it, me flow with the swing
The girl made me cum, boy, and guess what me sing

[Chorus: 2nd II None + (Hi-C)]
Take me to Compton where the hoochies come from (Right, right)
Take me to Compton where the hoochies come from

[Verse 2: Hi-C]
‘Cause some smart, some fat, some ugly, some dumb
Just take me to Compton where the hoochies come from
‘Cause when I’m on the mic, I like a fat sensi
And Jah, one love for me a Compton hoochie
Me love Compton (right), me love me hood
‘Cause in me neighborhood, you know bitches look good
Take it from me, boy, a Compton Rasta
Me know one girl, her name is Rasha
Me met the hoochie girl at a rap show
I ran me pimpin’ game and now she’s me hoe
She wanna fuck a rude boy, I just trip
It was me, D, KK, and the rude boy Quik
Me dick was in her mouth, D fucked from behind
K dick wouldn’t get hard, and Quik lost his mind
I wish could find, my nigga AMG
‘Cause he’s missing out on the good pussy
She grabbed me by my balls and start suckin’ me dick
I was cumming in her mouth and I said “bullshit”
I caught cramp in me leg, me eyesight was gone
When she finished with me dick, boy, me sing this song

[Chorus: 2nd II None + (Hi-C)]
Take me to Compton where the hoochies come from (Right, yes)
Take me to Compton where the hoochies come from
(Compton’s in the house, you know, 2nd II None)
Take me to Compton where the hoochies come from
(Hi-C, coming to Compton where the hoochies come from like this, you know)
Take me to Compton where the hoochies come from (Yes)
Take me to Compton where the hoochies come from
(Some fat, some smart)
Take me to Compton where the hoochies come from
(Some dumb, yes)
Take me to Compton where the hoochies come from
Take me to Compton where the hoochies come from

[Outro: Hi-C]
Yes, Hi-C’s on the mic and I’ma tell you like this
You know I’ma run it down to ya, tell you what the women need
Yo, me believe, good huggin’ women need
Me believe, good kissin’ women need
Me believe, good fuckin’ women need
‘Cause your love is not better than my love—repeat again
Come here, say, your love is not better than my love, love
Yes, Hi-C’s in the house
