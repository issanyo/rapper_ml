[Spoken Intro: Hi-C]
Yeah... H-I
It don't stop... y'all niggas must have forgot
Y'all motherfuckers gon' mind me
Yeah, check it out, check it out

[Verse 1: Hi-C]
Now I won't call ya crab if you don't call me slob
Livin' in the West is a full-time job
Niggas be trippin' off of petty shit
Nigga, miss me with that bank and then check yo' grip
You gots to know when to ride, know when to hide
Know when to blast, and try not to die
Niggas be wolfin' that yang and shit
Knowin' they be suckin' up a gang of dick
You need to stop runnin' your mouth, be quiet
You won't throw a rock in a riot
See, we can make shit like this all day
And serve it to yo' ass like some Aliz√©
All I wanna do is be a high roller
Step in my way, I'll eat yo' ass like ebola - virus
Hi' is the name - you knew it
Fuck what ya heard, I gotta do it like I'm used to it

[Chorus: Hi-C + DJ Quik talkbox]
Do it - do it, do it, do it
I gotta do it like I'm used to it
Do it - do it, do it, do it
("I'm a veteran, boy")
Do it - do it, do it, do it
I gotta do it like I'm used to it
Do it - do it, do it, do it
("I'm a veteran, boy")
Do it - do it, do it, do it
I gotta do it like I'm used to it
Do it - do it, do it, do it
("I'm a veteran, boy")

[Verse 2: Hi-C]
Now I don't mean to flag, sag, brag or boast
But I'm the most underrated nigga on this Coast
I'll fall on my knees, throw my hands up to God
Thinkin' to myself "Kumbaya my Lord"
If it don't work this time, I'll quit
I'm right back in the field, slangin' that shit
But life goes on and the Earth rotate
Players still playin' and haters still hate
Don't step in my path, I'll whip ass
And if a nigga talk shit, I'ma do ya bad
You gets the benefit of the doubt
But if you ain't legit, I'ma knock yo' ass out
Back in your mouth with that gangsta shit
Half-head's in the house, nah, we don't quit
Rem and Cashe and Kenny Mack
Lil' V from St. Louis even got my back
Quik, Stray, Inch, Fly, and G-One
Tony Lane in the Trees and a gang of guns
So come on down, be the first to get wet
You don't have to give me shit, I'ma take my respect
Leave a bitter taste in your face like lemon
Stackin' more chips than that nigga Russell Simmons
Y'all don't wanna see me in a rhyme fight
Thank you for comin' out, God bless ya, good night (*explosion*)
Y'all niggas better watch me...

[Chorus: Hi-C + DJ Quik talkbox]
Do it - do it, do it, do it
("I'm a veteran, boy")
Do it - do it, do it, do it
("I'm a veteran, boy")

[Verse 3: Hi-C]
Now let me dig deep in my memory bank
And come up with some shit to make a nightclub stank
Fool, what you think, we was doin' this for free?
Scratch in the bank, videos on TV
Don't hate me 'cause you're mad at the earth
Let the pistols bust, I'll lay yo' ass to the turf
Gargamel bitches, they'll never get this Smurf
A six-million-dollar man is what a nigga worth
Ladies in the house if you're down to win, say
(Nigga, what's up on my end?)
All the ladies in the house if you're down to win, say
(Nigga, what's up on my end?)
All the players in the house thats makin' scratch, say
(Bitch, it ain't goin' down like that)
All my players in the house thats makin' scratch, say
(Bitch, it ain't goin' down like that)
God gave me the talent, so why not use it?
Funk what ya heard, I gotta do it like I'm used to it

[Chorus: Hi-C + DJ Quik talkbox]
Do it - do it, do it, do it
I gotta do it like I'm used to it
Do it - do it, do it, do it
("I'm a veteran, boy")
Do it - do it, do it, do it
I gotta do it like I'm used to it
Do it - do it, do it, do it
("I'm a veteran, boy")
Do it - do it, do it, do it
I gotta do it like I'm used to it
Do it - do it, do it, do it
("I'm a veteran, boy")
Do it - do it, do it, do it
I gotta do it like I'm used to it
Do it - do it, do it, do it
("I'm a veteran, boy")
Yeah, H-I
Do it - do it, do it, do it
It don't stop
("I'm a veteran, boy")
Do it - do it, do it, do it
All y'all non-believin' ass muthafuckas out there
Show them how to do it
Do it - do it, do it, do it
Back up in your face...
("I'm a veteran, boy")
Show them how to do it
Do it - do it, do it, do it
In your mouth, in your cheek...all year, all month, all week
("I'm a veteran, boy")
Show them how to do it
Do it - do it, do it, do it
("I'm a veteran, boy")
Show them how to do it
Do it - do it, do it, do it
("I'm a veteran, boy")

[Outro: DJ Quik talkbox]
Show them how to do it
Do it, do it, you got to do it, do it
You might wanna do it, do it
Show them Compton does it, does it
And Hi-C does it, does it
'Cause Compton's in the house, oh yeah
And we can do it, do it
Like we used to it, do it, do it
Do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Ooh, bop bop ba da, Hi-C, Hi-C, yeah
They can't fade you or the CPT
We be doin' it - oh, we be doin' it
They can't understand, that you are the man
Get your swerve on, gotta get your swerve on
Everybody get your swerve on, everybody get your swerve on
Compton's in the house, Black Tone's in the house
Donzelle's in the house, Vicious in the house
Pee-Wee's in the house, Half-head's in the house
Compton's in the house, Westside in the house
West Coast in the house
And we be doin' it, doin' it, doin' it
Oh yeah, we do it, do it, do it, oh...
