Man, she lookin' for somebody that'll pay her rent
And grab her hair and hit her from the back and call her a bitch
Ol' nice ass nigga gets no respect
But I'll slap her in a minute and break her god damn neck
Things gon' never change huh? Sure the fuck not
I'mma pimp a prostitute because the game don't stop
I bet I'll see a brighter day though... what?
And if she disrespect the pimp she gettin' fucked up
She used to hoola-hoop, deal it with
Now she whip it on a trick so we can stack them chips
Tryin' to argue with a pimp just to see what I'll do
I'm into breakin' fingernails, what you heard was true
I'm tryin' to pimp 'til I just can't pimp no more
And it's nothin' to a pimp to go and get him some more
Cause niggas dress funny, act funny, walk funny, talk funny
Never realizin' that she only want your money, dummy

(Hey hey!) The hustler meets the pimp
And I'mma put it in your mouth like steak and skrimp
Fly high in the sky like a Goodyear blimp
Wear rubbers so I don't go out like Shawn Kemp
Back in the day she double dutch
Now she clutch nuts and double bust
Lookin' for that good, in God we trust
While the homies get high off angel dust
What Coast you bang? The left or the right?
What type of colors you like? The dark or the bright?
It don't matter cause it's on tonight
I wish a motherfucker would try to start a fight
(So whooot!) The homies 'bout thirty deep
And lil' nigga, you won't hit water at the beach
And you can't see the forest for the trees
Cause you fuckin' with some real O.G.'s

It ain't about your coochie baby, uh-uh
You got the wrong idea don't you?, uh-hu
She got to tellin' me her life story, and it's all the same
And after slappin' that bitch she respects my game
She ran away when she was little cause she learned to ho
And got smart cause she don't give it up for free no more
We take a real square bitch and get to turnin' her out
Cause she tired of y'all niggas runnin' off at the mouth
She wanna go places, not the same shit
Y'all tricks speak a real funny language
Act funny when a bitch come around you huh?
But you can have her for a minute if you payin' her right
Don't get mad nigga - this ain't for you
You a trick and you expect the bitch to love you?
Man, I got some bones in my body that you wish you had
And when she talkin' that shit you never beat her ass
