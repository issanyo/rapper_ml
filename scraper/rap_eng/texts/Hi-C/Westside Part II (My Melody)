[Intro: DJ Quik]
Ah (damn)…ah (uh oh)…ah-ah…ah…
Yeah
Can you feel it? If you do, let me slap your ass
Can you feel it, baby? If you do, let me slap your ass
Can you feel it, baby? If you do, let me slap your ass
Can you feel it, baby? And if you do, let me slap your ass

[Chorus: James DeBarge + (TQ)]
(Check out my melody)
I’ve got the look, you’ve got the melody
(Check out my melody)
And the melody is something we share
(That we share, we share)
You’ve got the look, I’ve got the melody
(Check out my melody)
And the melody is something we share
(I’ll take you there, take you there)

[Verse 1: Hi-C]
TQ, Hi-C, and DJ Quik
Got people all over singing, “That’s the shit”
We fall through the club, better check your chick
‘Cause nigga, you don’t know who you fonkin’ wit’
Got homies in the crew with platinum plaques
G’s in the bank that we hide from rats
So hey, no, hoe, don’t mess with that
Yo Q, won’t you tell ‘em where we bumpin’ at

[Verse 2: DJ Quik + (TQ)]
Compton, Carson, L.A., and Watts
Hi-C, TQ, Suga Free, Playa Hamm, it don’t stop
We comin’ up from under the water with thick sacks
With big body Benzes and broads with big backs
So TQ, help ‘em see the fly in me
And what I’ma do is help ‘em see the fly in you
It’s a CPT thang, we gotta pimp, we hate the jealousy
(Just bump my melody) You feel me

[Chorus: James DeBarge + (TQ)]
I’ve got the look, you’ve got the melody
(Check out my melody)
And the melody is something we share
(That we share, we share)
You’ve got the look, I’ve got the melody
(Check out my melody)
And the melody is something we share
(I’ll take you there, take you there)

[Verse 3: TQ]
Ever since I was a young boy (young boy)
Everybody always tripped off the fact that I
The music is my pride and joy (my pride and joy)
It don’t take too many hits to get me high
The other night I had a dream (could it be)
Coulda sworn I saw DJ Quik
With a box full of percussions and shit
Talkin’ ‘bout he going to the studio, wanna go?
Hopped in the Lexo, dark green like Humboldt County weed
Doing verses with Hamm and Suga Free
Wouldn’t it be large singing hooks with James DeBarge
My melody

[Chorus: James DeBarge + (TQ)]
I’ve got the look, you’ve got the melody
(Check out my melody)
And the melody is something we share
(That we share, we share)
You’ve got the look, I’ve got the melody
(Check out my melody)
And the melody is something we share
(I’ll take you there, take you there)

I’ve got the look, you’ve got the melody
(Check out my melody)
And the melody is something we share
(That we share, we share)
You’ve got the look, I’ve got the melody
(Check out my melody)
And the melody is something we share
(I’ll take you there, take you there)

[Verse 4: Playa Hamm]
See, ain’t nothin’ up but the price of advice
And ain’t nothin’ going down if we ain’t getting our slice
Still nothin’ nice if you got the fees
I used a whole clip with this Master P
So tell your girlfriends, first serve, then come
Then they got to send my loved ones with some
And way thicky, so make it way sticky ‘fore you call
And make sure them honeys know we play ball

[Verse 5: Suga Free]
See, said, there’s only two pieces of pussy that you’re gon’ ever get in your life
That’s your first and your last
Dumb nigga, all that shit in between don’t got no meaning—uh uh, now hate that
Now, do I love ya? Sure don’t
I’m that nigga that your mama and ya, and ya hoe want
Ol’ broke ass, no class, trick ass, bitch ass, wanna-be me ass—ooh, this shit is knockin’
Boy, sit down
Nigga, how many licks do you think it take to get in the center of a get down?
How many? Nope
Now go back and sit back down, I’m turning you back into a penny
I’m the genie of a lamp that you will never rub
That you will never touch—better quit playing with me, cuz
To the, E-E, nah, AH AH
My pimpin’ won’t stop until I make a million dollars

[Chorus: James DeBarge + (TQ)]
(Check out my melody)
I’ve got the look, you’ve got the melody
(Check out my melody)
And the melody is something we share
(That we share, we share)
You’ve got the look, I’ve got the melody
(Check out my melody)
And the melody is something we share
(I’ll take you there, take you there)

I’ve got the look, you’ve got the melody
(Check out my melody)
And the melody is something we share
(That we share, we share)
You’ve got the look, I’ve got the melody
(Check out my melody)
And the melody is something we share
(I’ll take you there, take you there)

[Outro: Suga Free]
Now go back and sit back down, I’m turning you back into a penny
Now go back and sit back down, I’m turning you back into a penny
