[Intro: Suga Free]
Oh yeah, once again
Your friendly.. neighbor.. hood.. player.. potna.. Suga Free
Is in this bitch.. bitch (in a real way)
Now I wanna break it down for my nigga DJ Quik
The almighty, funkster
The baddest to ever touch the MPC60
Or 3000 baby, you don't hear me
Clue Dogg, Blac Tone, Hi-C
Droppin' some bomb shit for your ass
As we dip da, tip toe to the 9-7

[Chorus]
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run

[Verse 1: Suga Free]
No, unh-uh, bitch, you done fucked up!
Yeah, I took your phone book and took a long look
At another nigga's name and his neighborhood, straight sucka
But I ain't finna break nann nail on you, hoe, unh-uh, bullshit, G
So that stinky ass slut can call my parole officer and say "he hit me"
And do a violation in Chino West, Mariposa dorm
To realize only reason that bitch wore panties is to keep her ankles warm
I'm, pimpin' and panderin' on the first degree
I'm writin' letters to a bitch that ain't thinkin' 'bout me
But I'm a pimp, mayne, so I'ma sharpen up my tools and bounce back
'Cause that bitch lips so big Chapstick had to invent a spray, so hey, fuck that
And knowin' that player hater ain't got one pimp bone in his body
That's funny, I-I can't-can't wait-wait to-to get-get my-my money
In a real way, hey Mr. Pimp Player Mack Superior
Drivin' that pussy lip pink Cadillac
With some of that jack off nut colored interior
Baby, don't cry, I know he trippin', but you with a winner
Lay on the hood of my Cadillac and hang your soakin' wet panties up on my antenna

[Chorus]
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
Yeah, it's Mr. Quik, tell me, who did you expect?
I'm back with Suga Free, and Hi-C for all respect
'Cause I've been doin' this shit for years and still impressin'
Tryna get whatcha owe me, nothin' more, nothin' less
'Cause in my black Lex, I rolls from county to county
City to city lookin' for the dark honeysuckle brown round titties
And bitches, y'all can't play or take me for a trick
Because I speaks softly, but carries a big ol' dick
And um, I like the bitches that ain't scared to use their hands
I like the bitches that'll get naked in the back of the van
Yeah, see see, I paid ya like I'm major
You bitches steadily gettin' over on them niggas that done paid ya
But then I just fire up my Newport and look at ya stupid
And then shoot you with an arrow like dick 'cause I ain't Cupid
Now go on and tip toe your ass up outta here

[Chorus]
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run

[Verse 3: Hi-C]
I bet ya recognize me, I'm nasty as they come
Mr. H-I-C, tip toe, but don't ya run
'Cause me and my dogs be chillin' in the Tree
DJ Quik, Black Tone, and Suga Free
Now tell me what ya want, baby, what ya need
I slap meat to a freak and make the ho nose bleed
'Cause bitches like you smoke up all the weed
And ain't givin up shit with yo' nappy weed
See a ho like you can shake my spot
Or suck my dick 'til you taste some snot
Naw, it don't stop, we stays on top
And bust like a muthafuckin' fo-fo shot
Fuck what you got, I'ma ride and swerve
Intoxicated, man I hate it when I scrapes the curb
Just slammed the door and the ho tried to work me
God damn ho, don't bitch, you tryna hurt me

[Chorus]
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
