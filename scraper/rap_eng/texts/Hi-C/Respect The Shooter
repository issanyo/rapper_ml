Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Slide, The Clip, And Pull, The Hammer Back
Point Your Gun, Then Homie, Go Handle That
Braaaa Stick Em, Ha Ha Ha Stick Em
Braaaa Stick Em, Ha Ha Ha Stick Em
Put Your Gloves On, Get Your Black Mask
You Niggas Ready? Come On Let's Go Handle That
Braaaa Stick Em, Ha Ha Ha Stick Em
Braaaa Stick Em, Ha Ha Ha Stick Em

[Lil' Murda:]
Stay Outta Site, Outta Mine, Retaliation Is A Must
If He Bleed Like Me, Any Nigga Can Get Touched
Got My Knife On My Belt and The Forty By My Phone Clip
I'm On The Edge, Fuck Around, and Get Your Dome Split
A Long Mission, I Remember Being Homeless
So In The Kitchen With Cause, Them Chickens Was Boneless
Yo Black Gloves, Black Mask, Black Shirt, Black Pants
You Know You Seeing Blood, When You See My Mach-10

[Hi-C:]
I Walked Through The Valley of the Shadow of Death
In All Black With My Gun, I'm The Shadow of Death
Your Just Full of Alotta Raps
Really Don't Be Poppin' Straps
Akay, Yo Peek Hole, Blow Off Your Stock and Cap
All The Real Niggas Voted For Me
Enemies Comming For Me
I Hope It's Complete
I Just Sit Low In My Seat
Blow Dro and The Sweet
Keep 8th On Me, You Would Think Kobe With Me BITCH!

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Slide, The Clip, And Pull, The Hammer Back
Point Your Gun, Then Homie, Go Handle That
Braaaa Stick Em, Ha Ha Ha Stick Em
Braaaa Stick Em, Ha Ha Ha Stick Em
Put Your Gloves On, Get Your Black Mask
You Niggas Ready? Come On Let's Go Handle That
Braaaa Stick Em, Ha Ha Ha Stick Em
Braaaa Stick Em, Ha Ha Ha Stick Em

[50 Cent:]
Robbery, Homicide, Fuck that I'm Down To Ride
Mask On, I Blast Some, Niggas See Em On Channel Nine
Bloods Set, Crips Set, I Trip Through Ya Set Trick
Freaks Flip, Full Clip, I Load, Then Reload Bitch
Gat Jam, God Damn, Hundred Gram, Dope Man
Maybach, Flow Benz, Sun Roof, Open
Spider With Me Loccin', Cali Buds, Smokin'
S & 97, Eastside, Nigga Fo' sure Man

[Lloyd Banks:]
From Southside To Cashville, Cashville To Cali
There's Fuck You Law, The Judge, And The Federallies
In The Black Benz, Black Rims, Ride Around With Mach-10's
Same Nigga From Back When, Get Money, Stacks Spend
Fuck A Bitch, Get The Dough, Fuck A Snitch, He Can Die
On Easter Sunday, I Celebrate, When He Reach The Sky
I'm On That Stupid Shit
Like Fuck A Gun Can Do This Zooly Shit'
There's Room In The Graveyard, You Can Fit'

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Slide, The Clip, And Pull, The Hammer Back
Point Your Gun, Then Homie, Go Handle That
Braaaa Stick Em, Ha Ha Ha Stick Em
Braaaa Stick Em, Ha Ha Ha Stick Em
Put Your Gloves On, Get Your Black Mask
You Niggas Ready? Come On Let's Go Handle That
Braaaa Stick Em, Ha Ha Ha Stick Em
Braaaa Stick Em, Ha Ha Ha Stick Em

[Spider Loc:]
It's Easy To Die In LA, Where I Gangbang
Ever Since The Curl
Played Out
Spider Loc, And It's Me Against The World
It Ain't Easy Being Loc'd Out
A Nigga An Outlaw
And I'm Ballin', Yeah I'm Gettin' Money Without Ya'll
Don't Know About You, But I Got Murders On My Block
I Bomb First, It's Just How We Do It On My Block
With 21 Guns To Shoot
Against Your Squad
My Unit Out To Get This Loot
Against All Odds

[Tony Yayo:]
My Revolvers On My Gucci Belt, Hand On The Metal
No Ski Mask, The Godfather of the Ghetto
I Ran Up In The Weed Spot, I'm Tired of Being Hungry
The Dread Like "Take The Weed and Leave The Money"
The Bananas On The Kays, Got The Hammer and the Gage
Got Your Ass On The Run, Like A Hamster In A Gage
Nigga Make This Shit Easy, Don't Contemplate
Give Me The Chain, The Watch, The Open, and The Safe

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Slide, The Clip, And Pull, The Hammer Back
Point Your Gun, Then Homie, Go Handle That
Braaaa Stick Em, Ha Ha Ha Stick Em
Braaaa Stick Em, Ha Ha Ha Stick Em
Put Your Gloves On, Get Your Black Mask
You Niggas Ready? Come On Let's Go Handle That
Braaaa Stick Em, Ha Ha Ha Stick Em
Braaaa Stick Em, Ha Ha Ha Stick Em
