[Chorus]
I'm just tryna get to know ya
Get a little closer
Baby, post up
Ooh, do you mind?
Do you mind?
Ooh, do you mind?
Do you mind?
We've been right here thinkin' 'bout it all night
Baby, you should be up in my bed
Ooh, do you mind?
Do you mind?
Ooh, do you mind?
Do you mind?

[Verse 1]
Would I be comin' on too strong if I said I want you now?
Would I be comin' on too strong if I said I wanna lay you down?
You can be my queen
Baby, you can wear the crown
First I gotta know if you want me to turn that body out
(I gotta know, baby)
(Oh yeah)
'Cause we don't know how this is gonna go
So baby, just lay back, enjoy the show
We ain't gotta rush when we're makin' love
I'ma take my time on it but you gotta know that
I'ma have you screamin' out
Callin' me daddy
We'll be doing things you can't tell your real daddy
Tell me what you want and I'ma do much more

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna get to know ya
Get a little closer
Baby, post up
Ooh, do you mind?
Do you mind?
Ooh, do you mind?
Do you mind?
We've been right here thinkin' 'bout it all night
Baby, you should be up in my bed
Ooh, do you mind?
Do you mind?
Ooh, do you mind?
Do you mind?

[Verse 2]
You can be my lil' mama not my baby mama
You know I be fuckin' up them commas
Dollars on dollars
Come on, holla at me
But if I do it right you might never leave
Knock that thing out like Ronda Rousey
When I hit it with my stick, never miss like Jet Li
Wanna test me?
We can go right now
Really think you finna fit this all in your mouth?
I can take you down like Chris Brown
Yeah, this is how they do it in my town
So come here once you turn them lights down
You can keep them Jimmy Choos on while I hit that touchdown
Now ain't the time to be actin' coy
You knew what it was when you started messin' with a playboy
You my playboy bunny
Come on and hug me
Wait no
What rhymes with hug me?


[Chorus]
I'm just tryna get to know ya
Get a little closer
Baby, post up
Ooh, do you mind?
Do you mind?
Ooh, do you mind?
Do you mind?
We've been right here thinkin' 'bout it all night
Baby, you should be up in my bed
Ooh, do you mind?
Do you mind?
Ooh, do you mind?
Do you mind?

[Outro]
(Tell me again)
Tell me again, my baby
(How we'll be lovers and friends)
I gotta know, baby
Oh yeah
(Tell me again)
(How we'll be lovers and friends)
Make sure you're right oh before we shoot
