[Intro: Zhavia Ward]
Burn, burn, burn, burn

[Verse 1: Zhavia Ward]
Dark space, Iâ€™m slipping into dangerous ways
Looking for a familiar face
Not too far from home
And it's all, it's all, all too much
When you can't see the shiny under the rust
So you hide away, sheltered from the rain

[Pre-Chorus: Zhavia Ward]
And I've been getting tired of all these patterns
I see it written on the wall
And I've been walking through my own disaster
Thinking it's time to move on

[Chorus: Zhavia Ward]
I don't wanna run from a bullet
Gotta leave my candlelight burning
If it goes out, I would lose it
Gotta let my candlelight burn, burn, burn
I feel something pulling
Gotta leave my candlelight burning
If it goes out, I would lose it
Gotta let my candlelight burn, burn, burn, burn

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Ooh, angel from an angle
Hold on to intangibles
Gripping on a handle
I can't put a finger on it, no, no, no, no
Angel from an angle
So hard to see the halo
Know they love to blame it on me
Burning bridge, I'm hanging on, oh no, no, no

[Pre-Chorus: Zhavia Ward, Jeremih, Both]
And I've been getting tired of all these patterns (Yeah)
I see it written on the wall
And I've been walking through my own disaster
Thinking it's time to move on (Thinking it's time to move on, it's time to move on)

[Chorus: Zhavia Ward & Jeremih]
I don't wanna run from a bullet
Gotta leave my candlelight burning (Oh, oh, oh)
If it goes out, I would lose it (If it goes out)
Gotta let my candlelight burn, burn, burn (Keep on, oh)
I feel something pulling (Oh, oh, oh)
Gotta leave my candlelight burning (Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn)
If it goes out, I would lose it (Don't, no)
Gotta let my candlelight burn, burn, burn, burn (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Zhavia Ward & Jeremih]
(Bullet)
Bullet, babe, oh
(Burning)
(Lose it)
Yeah, yeah
Burn, burn, burn, burn
Yeah
(Bullet)
Yeah, yeah
(Burning)
Yeah
(Lose it)
Mm-hmm
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, let it burn
Burn, burn, burn, burn
