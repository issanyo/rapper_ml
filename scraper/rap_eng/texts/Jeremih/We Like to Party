[Verse 1]
Come here miss fancy
Let me rub on them panties
You say you wanna play, play
C'mon and swing it my way, my way
I know you got gifts girl
Well lemme open your presents
You know who I am
Cause the DJ be playin' my jam

[Chorus]
Lemme hear it now (boom, boom, boom, boom)
Lemme hear it now (boom, boom, boom, boom)
Lemme hear it now (boom, boom, boom, boom)
DJ. Lemme hear it now

We like to Party, party
Party, party
Party, party
Party
(oooh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Got me swiping my Visa
You lookin' like the Mona Lisa (Lisa)
Or is it the Bombay
Let me look at you like a entree (all day)

I got shot by cupid
I know your ex feels stupid
But, to hell what he says (says)
Tell the DJ to hit the replay

[Chorus]
Lemme hear it now (boom, boom, boom, boom)
Lemme hear it now (boom, boom, boom, boom)
Lemme hear it now (boom, boom, boom, boom)
DJ. Lemme hear it now

We like to Party, party
Party, party
Party, party
Party
