[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I came in thirty deep like that
And if you callin' and you see your bitch leave
Lil nigga it's on, like that
Rippin' it, rippin' it, rippin' it, rippin' it
Rippers, like that
Throwin' hunnits and hunnits and hunnits
And make a scene, scene, scene, like that
(PX, watch out)

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Jeremih]
I can't keep a thou' without throwin' it
I can't keep a pound without blowin' it
Can't kick it with these niggas, this ain't soccer stop it
I'm just tryna knock it just like Sock'em Boppers
I got that boom boom, and that boom bap
In the booby trap, they can't trap like that
I got the bands and all the Xans though
All of these Addies I canâ€™t subtract hoes
Who you shockin', who you shockin' like you got the plug?
Why she poppin'? Why she lock it like she from New York?
What she watchin'? Who she watchin'? Is she mine or yours?
23 karat diamonds, this ain't Michael Kors

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I came in thirty deep like that
And if you callin' and you see your bitch leave
Lil nigga it's on, like that
Rippin' it, rippin' it, rippin' it, rippin' it
Rippers, like that
Throwin' hunnits and hunnits and hunnits
And make a scene, scene, scene, like that
(J, aye)

[Verse 2: Jeremih + PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Jeremih might pull up on your ass
Every day your birthday, have birthday sex with you
I ain't tryna text you, girl I'm tryna be sexual
I'm just tryna kick it, and lay back and get flexible
With some chains, tell me which nigga you on, baby
And the ride a white on white, baby
I might pull up and I'mma leave with his slut
Scissorhands, give me my cut
Yeah your man been with the bust
I'm the plug and the price goin' up
And I keep a couple don'ts with my fucks

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I came in thirty deep like that
And if you callin' and you see your bitch leave
Lil nigga it's on, like that
Rippin' it, rippin' it, rippin' it, rippin' it
Rippers, like that
Throwin' hunnits and hunnits and hunnits
And make a scene, scene, scene, like that
(Wayne, watch out)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Like that, I got a hundred bitches on the way
Like that, feel like a hundred chickens on the way
And like that, I got a hundred chickens on the way
That white flag, that's when these hoes surrender on the yay
They like that, you know the plug know me by face, ho
Like that, but he no habla ingles though
Like that, the money train is on the way, ho
Like that, well you can tie me to the railroad
Like that, I got a hundred bitches on display
My bad, I blew a hundred million on mistake
Right back, another hundred comin' on the way
If I trap, we do a hundred corners in a day
Hundred goons on the way
One hundred shots in your face, what you gon' say?
Need a code to the safe
Leavin' a note for bae, she cry every day
I do not show no emotions
So much bass we got distortion
All of my waves in motion, all of my goons important
All of my ladies are gorgeous
Buyin' Mercedes' and Porsches
All of my niggas are warriors
None of my niggas employers
All of my niggas are loyal
Everybody shine like foil
Everything's lookin' alright
Yeah I just talked to my lawyer, it's time to enjoy, yeah
Tune it's time to enjoy, yeah
I had to tell myself on the track cause sometimes I ignore it
Damn
Like dat
Like dat
Like dat
We do a hundred corners every day!

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I came in thirty deep like dat
And if you callin' and you see your bitch leave
Lil nigga it's on, like dat
Rippin' it, rippin' it, rippin' it, rippin' it
Rippers, like that
Throwin' hunnits and hunnits and hunnits
And make a scene, scene, scene, like dat
