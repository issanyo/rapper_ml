[Verse 1: Jeremih]
I don't wanna wait
Your body won’t leave me alone
And I ain't trying to play no games, tonight

Yeah, you know we grown
We both ain't trying to be alone
Show me where you got all that from, tonight

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Wanna go somewhere, babe?
Make you feel like a little vaycay
Girl, you know you wan' be my baby
Now, she say she wan' have my baby

We still lighted with my crew, go
Nothing beating me and you, solo
I just really wanna see your drop top
You just want a G all in your G-spot

[Interlude: Jeremih]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
She go in there, she go in there

Man, shit getting crazy, hazy
With a Blasian bad bitch up in Vegas, bitch amaze me
Shake it, I want you shaking, 'cause it pays you
Shout-out to your momma 'cause she made you

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Damn, I ain't trying to be alone
I ain't tryna go home
I ain't never seen her before tonight

Everything that you do
Honestly, I'm down with for sure
Tell me where you going after, tonight

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Bet you wanna go somewhere, babe
Make you feel like a little vaycay
Girl, you know you wan' be my baby
Now, she say she wan' have my baby

We still lighted with my crew, go
Nothing beating me and you, solo
I just really wanna see your drop top
You just want a G all in your G-spot

[Post-Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
She go in there, she go in there
I give my love, I give my love
She go in there, she go in...

Oh yeah, oh yeah
She coming with, she coming with
Yo, she the one, yeah, she the one, ah

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper & Jeremih]
I don't understand
Why these niggas gotta hate
What's a rat to the cat?
Mongoose to a snake?

You know that they looking for you
You just sit your ass and wait
But don’t do none of that looking
Like your ass on static

Pussy nigga you don’t want smoke
You don’t want smoke
He don’t want smoke
You don’t want smoke

Yellow diamonds shining when I wake up
Bad bitch clowning out in Vegas
Fuck your designer, yeah, we made it
Chi-Town, blow, now we major

You don’t want smoke
You don’t want smoke
He don’t want smoke
Hell no, you don’t want smoke
