[Hook: Jeremih]
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fucking like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do

Don't tell 'em
Don't tell 'em
You ain't even
Don't tell 'em
Don't tell 'em
You ain't even
You ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em
You ain't even
Don't you tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em
You ain't even
You ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em
Don't tell 'em

[Verse 1: JD Styles]
She a dime that they mixed in with the flirting kind
All kinds of company yet hoping she preferring mine
Time to kill baby maybe you and I could murder time
Every time she moves, it remind me of my dirty mind

Shhhh... can you keep a secret boo
Can't hold it down then they ain't no way I'm keeping you
Swagged out hot boy always known to keep it cool
'hind closed doors I'ma show you what the freak could do

Between me and you my swagger on a different level
Game getting gold if the women up for giving medals
See they gon' try to bring you down but never think to settle
Tell them haters keep moving and get to kicking pebbles

Only it's you got me feeling like this
Oh why, why, why, why
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That's right, right, right, right, right

[Hook: Jeremih]

[Verse 2: JD Styles]
Boy bout to kill it, hope you make it to the funeral
Bartender fill the glass i raise it to the beautiful
Swagg off the charts, breaking necks when I'm moving through
(Pause) The way you're staring suggesting that this is new to you

Ha! So listen rookie I'ma veteran
Shorty with that sick body know I got that medicine
Haters getting angry cause I'm everything they never been
I'm all about moves no late talking like ya Letterman

Her body banging and there ain't no way to fight that
Sending lust letters, and I'm betting she gon' write back
Ya lying to ya girls if ya saying you'll be right back
Headed to the crib, we gon' end it with a night cap

Only it's you got me feeling like this
Oh why, why, why, why
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That's right, right, right, right, right

[Hook: Jeremih]
