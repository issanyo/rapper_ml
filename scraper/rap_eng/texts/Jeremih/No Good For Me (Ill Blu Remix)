[Intro: Jeremih & Yungen]
A-A-AAA-ADP
(I swear that your love is no good for me)
Youngboy , ADP

[Verse 1: Yungen]
I see the trouble in her eyes
I don't want no drama , but you feel obliged
Yeah, I know all your lies
Your the low to my highs
You're not one I can show to the guys
Call me the gold-digging swerver
That's not, that's just murder
But I don't wanna bad ting, I want a posh [?]
This is that top corner, David Beckham, curler
They say you go hard
But finesse me, no dog
And you want a new bag I hear you talking bout a goyard
And you ain't got no yard
But I love it even though I know its wrong
And she's a spice when you're coming where I'm from
I feel like I'm incomplete, feel like my hairs blond
The way im singing when I see her in her thong
[Chorus: Jeremih]
Only care about yourself
Give a fuck bout no one else
Getting better on my health
While increasing on my wealth
Only care bout yourself
I swear that your love is no good for me
I swear that your love is no good for me
(You know, You know)
I swear that your love is no good for me
I swear, I swear that your love is no good for me
Only care bout yourself
I swear that your love is no good for me
I swear that your love is no good for me

[Verse 2: Not3s]
Our love's like quiet waters and tsunamis
One day its great, then we fighting
Don't try get your friends involved
Thought I'll leave your homegirl silenced
Quiet and silenced, yeah no one should speak
They're on the outside
While I am knees deep
Into us, but you're into the cost of things
It can't be my money you're bothering

And I swear her love is no good for me
But she sweet serenade like Pusha T
So Christian my Browning
But they cannot see what I can see, ooh girl
You cannot be alone, girl no
You can't stand on your own
You're in need of me, I know that you know

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Only care about yourself
Give a fuck bout no one else
Getting better on my health
While increasing on my wealth
Only care bout yourself
I swear that your love is no good for me
I swear that your love is no good for me
(You know, You know)
I swear that your love is no good for me
I swear, I swear that your love is no good for me
Only care bout yourself
I swear that your love is no good for me
I swear that your love is no good for me
