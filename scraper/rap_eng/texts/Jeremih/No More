[Intro]
Yeah, Shlohmo
Let me know
Yeah, turn it up
Turn it up

[Verse 1]
Well
Emotions known to take away your buzz
I know your name
Tell me what you're really waiting for

[Chorus]
I know you know
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait, no more
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait, no more
No more

The way you live it up and let me rub you down, oh
And I won't let it out
Until you let me know if you love it

[Verse 2]
Just admit it, you got it, baby
Ain't you ready to go?
And you with it, you know it, lady
Tell me, baby, I know

Tell me reason she still here, waiting
And you've felt this before
All I want is you now and later
Go wherever I go

Do whatever I do
Go wherever I go
Go wherever, you know

[Chorus]
I know you know
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait, no more
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait, no more
No more

The way you live it up
And let me rub you down, oh
And I won't let it out
Until you let me know if you love it

[Bridge]
Aye baby
I'ma take it low, I'ma take your body
I'll take it, forever
I'll take it all, I'ma take it all

All this, let me fuck this bitch
Where you want it?
Just come, this is your description

Where we going, baby?
What you waiting for?
You can run away 'til you're gone
