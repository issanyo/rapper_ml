[Intro]
A-A-A
Americanos

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
3AM time to take another xan
She blowin' on me, man I love my fans
100 grand if you want my plane to land
I can show you but you'll never understand

[Chorus: Jeremih]
No, no, you'll never understand
No, no, but you'll never understand
200 grand I just copped another Lamb'
I could show you but you'll never understand

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
She could speak Italian, blame it on the Gucci
Fly her to Japan, just to get the sushi
You know I, had to find a way to spend up all this cash
I need a bag too much paper in my hand
Comma, comma, comma, I been doing numbers
Even my pajamas, Louis, Fendi, Ferragamo
You know I, had to find a way to spend this cash
She cum first and I finish last

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
3AM time to take another xan
She blowin' on me, man I love my fans
100 grand if you want my plane to land
I can show you but you'll never understand

[Chorus: Jeremih]
No, no, you'll never understand
No, no, but you'll never understand
200 grand I just copped another Lamb'
I could show you but you'll never understand

[Verse 2: Smokepurpp]
Thousand dollar shoes
Made me flex on you
Flexin' on my ex, flex up in the coupe (skrr)
Money two times two (two), in my Jimmy Choo's (Choo)
In my brand new true's, got a lotta truth
Suck me, fuck me, suck me like you do
Have you fuck the crew (crew), then I'm done with you
Diamonds on my teeth look like glaciers (glaciers)
Water got me sinking like an anchor

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
3AM time to take another xan
She blowin' on me, man I love my fans
100 grand if you want my plane to land
I can show you but you'll never understand

[Chorus: Jeremih]
No, no, you'll never understand
No, no, but you'll never understand
200 grand I just copped another Lamb'
I could show you but you'll never understand

No, no, you'll never understand
No, no, but you'll never understand
200 grand I just copped another Lamb'
I could show you but you'll never understand
