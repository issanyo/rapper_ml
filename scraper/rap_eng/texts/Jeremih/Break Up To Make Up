[Intro: Jeremih]
Yo why should we break up?
If we keep making up
I mean let's just stay together

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
I know, together we make this relationship
A little harder at least on ourselves
We give and we take from each other some much that
I feel we don't need no one else
We fuss and we fight then the next day
We tight this is crazy girl you need some help
Girl if you...

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
Pull up to my window
Imma take your order
Anything you want girl you know I'll get it for ya
Say you wanna be my baby, you know
I gotta spoil ya
For the rest of my life I'm ready to enjoy us

[Hook: Jeremih]
So why the hell we break up
If we only make up
I ain't gonna stop now I gotta front you the only one
I want girl
So why the hell we break up
If we only make up

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Ah, we woke with the birds and this is soft
That would lead you right into my arms
The perfect equation like m x plus b equals why we are probably apart
The no one on this earth is
Like missed but is worth it someone that
I could do anything for
It seems like your pouring your heart away
But if you...

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
Pull up to my window
Imma take your order
Anything you want girl you know I'll get it for ya
Say you wanna be my baby, you know
I gotta spoil ya
For the rest of my life I'm ready to enjoy us

[Hook: Jeremih]
So why the hell we break up
If we only make up
I ain't gonna stop now I gotta front you the only one
I want girl
So why the hell we break up
If we only make up

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
In the middle of the night I be wondering why
Why you ain't right here
Many days that go by and I ain't gon lie
I need you right here
My baby but after all call me crazy, but your like a drug
Summer kiss daily and we get back in love
Cupid in the sky cause girl you I-I-I love you
And I know sometimes we struggle
You are the piece to the puzzle
Come here take a ride
Someone to...

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
Pull up to my window
Imma take your order
Anything you want girl you know I'll get it for ya
Say you wanna be my baby, you know
I gotta spoil ya
For the rest of my life I'm ready to enjoy us

[Hook: Jeremih]
So why the hell we break up
If we only make up
I ain't gonna stop now I gotta front you the only one
I want girl
So why the hell we break up
If we only make up
