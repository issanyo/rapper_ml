[Intro: Stefflon Don]
Yo, Stefflon Don
Five minus four, one

[Verse 1: Stefflon Don]
Mi ah go kill it, mi papi just say you wit it
Even if you pull up in the Honda Civic, you can get it
Rub up on it

But please don’t make me fall in love then act like you’re retard-ed
Buss like a nine millime-ter
Not a side bitch mi a kee-per
Looking so hot giving fe-ver
Tell 'em [?] di pum pum like beat-er
Can mi have di ting, where di gangwah
Clean, look pretty, speak patwa
Big kitty, boom flick, pon a gangsta
Tun any bloodclaat man [?]

[Chorus 1: Jeremih & Kat DeLuna]
Oh what a night
Got my girl with me, got my girl with me tonight
And tonight we gon' party like it's 1999
Yeah, we gon' bring love back to the club
We gon' bring love, love to the club
Oh what a night
Oh what a night
Oh what a night

[Verse 2: Kat DeLuna]
Everybody knows it, yep, I'm that bitch
I'm the one that you bring home to momma
Now let me tell you one thing real quick
If these girls ain't for you, this chick is loyal
I'll do anything for you, tell me what you want
I'm the one that's gonna ride for a real one, all night, all night

[Chorus 2: Kat DeLuna & Jeremih]
Oh what a night
Got my man with me, got my man with me tonight
And tonight we gon' party like it's 1999
Yeah and we gon' bring love back to the club
And we gon' bring love, love to the club
Oh what a night
(Oh what a night)
Oh what a night
Oh what a night
Oh what a night

[Bridge: Jeremih and Kat DeLuna]
What you doing girl? The plan's on you
But I plan to put my hands on you
Go to Miami, put the tans on you
Take you to the KOD and put some bands on you
Baby watch me while I dance on you
I ain't trippin' what my ex gon' do?
Cause I'm gonna be with a real one all night

[Chorus 3: Jeremih & Kat DeLuna]
Oh what a night
Got my girl with me, got my girl with me tonight
And tonight we gon' party like it's 1999
Yeah, we gon' bring love back to the club
And we gon' bring love, love to the club
Oh what a night
Oh what a night
Oh what a night
Oh what a night
