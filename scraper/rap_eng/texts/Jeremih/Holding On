[Verse 1]
How can one fall all the time
And climb again?
How does one heart feel so lost
To find again?
How can one road
Lead, the way today?
Before givin' it all

[Chorus]
I wish I could
Fly to the top of the mountains
So that I could
See just how far this will go (go, go)
Feels like I'm stuck in the battle
Equipped with no armor
But still standing strong
'Cause to be a survivor, y'all gotta know
How, y'all better know
How to keep holdin' on

[Verse 2]
How does one give all they got (trust)
Receive a half?
How does one live day to day (day)
Forget the past?
I'm all here on my own (if so)
I'ma do this all alone
I can never live and be afraid, yeah

[Chorus]
I wish I could
Fly to the top of the mountains
So that I could
See just how far this will go (go, go)
Feels like I'm stuck in the battle
Equipped with no armor
But still standing strong
'Cause to be a survivor, y'all gotta know
How, y'all better know
How to keep holdin' on

[Bridge]
Against the wind
I'm not givin' in, I once spoke to
A prophet he said don't stop 'til you got it (ooooh)
I'm not feeling fooled
I'm not letting go (no)
They tryna break me down but I'm not fraction, no
For all we know
This rocky road, would it just be the translation to unstoppable
Before the world recall those in
I wish I had win, to pretend and then...

[Chorus]
Then maybe I could
Fly to the top of the mountains
So that I could see
Just how far this will go
Feels like I'm stuck in the battle
Equipped with no armor
But still standing strong
'Cause to be a survivor, y'all gotta know
How, y'all better know
How to keep holdin' on (yeah)
Holdin' on (yeah), holdin' on (yeah), holdin' on

[Outro]
Feels like I'm stuck in the battle
Equipped with no armor
But still standing strong
'Cause to be a survivor, y'all gotta know
How, y'all better know
How to keep holdin'
