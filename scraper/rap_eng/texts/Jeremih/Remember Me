[Verse 1]
Fortunate to know you babe
While I've been busy running these streets
You make sure your home is straight
While I be politicking with the freaks
And I know everything has changed
Everything with you and me
Cause you know where my heart is girl
In our bed where you sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope we make it babe
For rich or poor, we won't be broke
But baby even if a nigga ain't rich

[Chorus]
Remember me like this
Just like this
Remember me like this
Just like this

[Verse 2]
I know my loyalty, you waiting on it
But you've had it since the day you met it
Now I'd lose my way girl if I left you lonely
It's because of who we are, you hear love

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope we make it babe
For rich or poor, we won't be broke
But baby even if your nigga ain't rich

[Chorus]
Just remember me like this
Just like this
Remember me like this
Just like this

[Bridge]
Have me lover
Keep me baby
Think of me forever this way
Hold me closer, keep me safe
Now I told you, love don't change
Love me lover
Keep me baby
Think of me forever this way
Hold me closer, keep me safe
Keep me safe, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope, I hope, I hope I hope, I hope, I hope I hope we make it babe
For rich or poor we won't be broke
But baby even if your nigga ain't rich

[Chorus]
Remember me like this
Just like this
Remember me like this
