(Hook)
Let me down easy
Oh your love for me it's gone
Let me down easy
Since you feel to stay is wrong
I know you don't love me

(Verse 1)
Big nigga mix the Remy with the SoCo
Plus I keep the pussy in a low post
Shawty said she want it in the Phantom
Sorry baby I don't push a Phantom
White girl got a booty like Coco
But nigga gotta get it in a photo
Then I gotta hit her with the cannon
Real strong Bruce Banner
I know you love it when I release the D
Let her see your face when I unleash the beast
So you can make it clap girl at least for me
She ain't even Puerto Rican screaming "Papi, papi!"
Oh, girl hit me up, bud for the high
Love for the love, gon' push me enough
And I'm leanin' like Weezy
Just let me down easy

(Hook)
Let me down easy
Oh your love for me it's gone
Let me down easy
Said you feel just you were wrong
I know you don't love me

(Verse 2)
To hell with all this fasting
This shit here is classic
All the whips, she crashed it
All the checks, she cashed in
But now I'm getting 'bout tired
All of this shit is faker than plastic
Yeah I'm supposed to feel bad for a ho
Nigga, four hoes? Fantastic
Now she going off they say
Now she textin' me lately
Talking about how she can't wait wait
But Jeremih ain't giving no date day
This is wrong call 911
Cause the testimony's mayday
Now for one other minute don't tease me
It don't please me, just let me down easy

(Hook)
Let me down easy
Oh your love for me it's gone
Let me down easy
Said you feel just you were wrong
I know you don't love me
