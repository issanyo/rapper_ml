[Intro]
Doing your body right
It’s everything he don’t like
Girl we be breaking headboards, headboards, headboards
We be breaking headboards, headboards, records
Let your feet touch the sky
Get all of your feelings right
And we be breaking headboards, headboards, headboards
We be breaking headboards, records, legs sore

[Verse 1]
Throw, I play tag with your body
Spin the bottle, have you kiss it
Just Kama Sutra, have you switch it
You woulda thought that we was playing Twister
But I ain’t here to play no games, play no games
What I’m saying is
The neighbors think it’s a fight
It’s best I don’t spend the night

[Chorus]
Girl we be breaking headboards, headboards, headboards
We be breaking headboards, headboards, records
Headboards babe, headboards babe, headboard babe

[Verse 2]
She say what you stand for babe?
Stand for me, stand for me
I'mma kiss you right there
We don’t need no lights here
She know ain’t no "A" in my name
She know my name
She say my name (Jeremih)
We start off fast and end slow
And you know, all I promote
I'ma kiss all of your lips
I'ma start right with your hips
Got your body bustin' off clips
No, he don't do it like this

[Chorus]
Doing your body right
It’s everything he don’t like
Girl we be breaking headboards, headboards, headboards
We be breaking headboards, headboards, records
Let your feet touch the sky
Get all in your feelings right
And we be breaking headboards, headboards, headboards
We be breaking headboards, records, legs sore

[Outro]
Uh, make it a little harder, harder, yes
Mmmm, baby
Mmmm, Mmmm
I can handle it, uh deeper
