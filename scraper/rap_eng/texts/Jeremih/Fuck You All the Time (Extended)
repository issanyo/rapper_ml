[Pre-Hook: Natasha Mosley]
Morning's when I think about you, yeah
I hit you, like "What you saying?"
In the morning's when I wanna fuck you, yeah
I hit you, like "What you..."

Early in the morning's when I think about you, yeah
I hit you, like "What you saying?"
In the morning's when I wanna fuck you, yeah
I hit you, like "What you saying?"

[Hook: Natasha]
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
M.O.E.T
That's the fuck we sip
That's the fuck we drip
My trap house still tip

Facetime when I'm gone
She give me dome from a distance
And she loves to climb on top
Because she loves to walk off limping

Pimps up, hoes down
Legs up or toes down
Why she jock me? 'Cause she's knock-kneed
And we've got trees so Mary, go around

Gotta know, I ate her
She's so sweet, now or later
I want that all the time, all the time
I'll make you all mine

[Pre-Hook: Natasha Mosley]
Early in the morning's when I think about you, yeah
I hit you, like "What you saying?"
In the morning's when I wanna fuck you, yeah
I hit you, like "What you saying?"

[Hook: Natasha]
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Damn, damn, mommy, your sticky-icky-icky
Got a nigga out here, feeling picky-icky-icky
Every time he put it on me, man, leave 'em real trippy
Every time we on it, we keep it fifty-fifty

Don't let the time ticky-icky-icky
While I'm snapping off your bra and biting down your Vickie's
(Head shots) Feeling real tipsy
Getting real freaky and it's getting really frisky

Chanel say no, then she say go
Up and down that pole, she go, go
Fuck me like you hate me, kiss me like you miss me
"Anything I want to", is what she always tells me

[Pre-Hook: Natasha Mosley]
Early in the morning's when I think about you, yeah
I hit you, like "What you saying?" (I could fuck you all the time)
In the morning's when I wanna fuck you, yeah
I hit you, like "What you saying?"

[Hook: Natasha]
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time

I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time

I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time
