[INTRO]
You know, you're like a guardian angel
Sent down from Heaven

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Baby let your hair down, let me set the mood right
Blend in with the stars, underneath the moon light
We can take it far, farther than we've ever gone
(or been)
There must be a magnet
Cuz physical attraction runs through our veins, love-
Making's everlasting
Lights and the cameras. We're never out of action
(nooooo)

[Hook]
Every time we make love
All night, all night, all
When we make love, all night, all night
With you

[Verse 2]
Is it just my 'magination spinnin' through my head?
Sipping champagne, rose petals on the bed
Teach each other lessons over and again like (one, two, three)
Baby when we kiss (feels just like it's Heaven)
When we touch, oh, I just gotta hold you in my arms
Gotta keep you up until it's all done

[Hook]

La la la la love
[X6]

[Breakdown]
I'll give it to you from my heart
Cause you got the kind of love one wishes upon a star
Don't tell me to go, cause I won't stop
Until the morning comes
Rays of sun, yeah

[Reprise of the Hook]
That's when you know we made love
All night, all night, all
Yeah, you know we love to make love
All night, all night, all night
With you

La la la la love
[X6 til fade]
