[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Hey, Ms. Parker (Hello)
Can I shovel your snow? (Can I shovel your snow?)
Let me help you with the groceries (yeah, yeah)
Walk you to the door (Walk you to the door)
Hey there neighbor! (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Can I take out the trash? (Can I take out the trash?)
Where is your hubby? (I know)
When he get back? (When he get back?)

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
When he get back? (When he get back?)
Damn you so bad (Damn you so bad)
That's not your bad (That's not your bad)
That's just my bad (That's just my bad)
I can't help it (No, not myself)
I just need a solid (Took you down back)
Just hit me when your kids go to bed
Let's go somewhere, I'll be slidin down your sled
I just wanna keep warm, I don't wanna hold your hand (huh-huh)
We grown, ain't getting younger, let's live it up in the bed (argh)

[Bridge: Jeremih & Chance The Rapper]

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper & Jeremih]
You know I've been a good boy (good boy)
I know you got good toys
But you want a real boy
Sing it in your good voice

Fuck with me, I got the hookup (hookup, hookup)
Why you still down with that nigga
You gone every time I look up
When I when you, wanna owe you, wanna know you, want a young nigga
My girl since I was little, well, but now I'm bigger
We just got to hurry up before he get close
I don't wanna turn your pretty ass into a widow
