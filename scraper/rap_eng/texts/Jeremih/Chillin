Before we even start
We gonna need a break
The way we been on and on
Oh yeah, you better know
Yeah
See the sun going down
It's kind of late
Yeah
Tell me what you want, what you saw
On the day when you fell in love
Oh

When I'm in the buildin'
Feel like it's the beginnin'
Feel like I made a killin'
Swear I just made a killin'
Gotta keep it real and
Oh, I love this feelin'
You know I be chillin'
You know I be chillin'
Feel like I'm off a pill and
My whip ain't got no ceilin'
There goes another day
Here comes another million
Gotta keep it real and
They ask me how I'm feelin'
My nigga I'm chillin'
My nigga I'm chillin'

Yeah I'm chillin' totally
Vintage girl all over me
She whispered in my ear like
"Boy don't act like you ain't know that's me"
I say "Ay girl you cold to me"
She say "Yeah, I know" to me
I say "Where your head at?
Guess not where it's supposed to be"
So I stripped her down to that lace
Then she said "You are a pole to me"
And up and down she go
Girl you got that bomb that blow to me
That sea foam, sea foam, cocoa leaf
Go light one up and roll one for me
Couple shots of that liq
Forget about what we did
Take a look at the kid
Grown up, got big
Man, ain't shit they can say
When I pull up in this whip
Man, I'm lovin' this, I'm love this shit
Now let me go and just say it
Every time I push start
You never want it to end
I'm a rider (Hey!)
Spy your girl tryna pull an all-nighter (Whoa!)
Real nigga
See all that fake be counterfeit
Man this flow just make me sick
I overheard you got the boot
Cause you know we knockin' it

Before we even start

Here comes another million
Gotta keep it real and
They ask me how I'm feelin'
My nigga I'm chillin'
My nigga I'm chillin'

I be chillin', the feeling is like a brain freeze
I’m vacationin’ and all the places that can't be
Instagraming pictures for all the ppl who can't see
With two middle fingers for all the niggas who ain't me
It's fuck ya'll I'm goin' thru withdrawals
Big pause
Do what I want when I wanna despite the drama
Pocket full of commas, eat breakfast at benihana's
I pulled up in the same car that Ross like
Can't tell you what it cost but it's boss, right?
You never worry about the cost when you floss right
The chick I’m with, she ain’t my chick, but shit it’s alright
She want players I let her have it
I'm rock and rolled on her ass
I think I'm Lenny Kravitz
You think it's good, she think I'm better
She used to average I guess I upgrade her
