[Verse 2: THEY. & Jeremih]
Half you niggas interchangeable
Forget about you in a day or two
I attain what's attainable

Tell y’all, be the truth (Truth)
New car raise the roof
Coppin cars for the troops, just got a crib for mom dukes (Yeah yeah yeah)
Crib cost a ticket (Cost a ticket)
Can't get evicted (Not me)
Singing got me situ-Autograph 'bout twenty thousand titties (Swear)

Put her on a fee, my business ain't cheap, (Nah nah nah)
Made a million dollars, gotta thank the Father
Gave it all for free (Amen)
Put my homie on the up, yeah
Diamonds ridin’ with the cuffs, yeah
Brand new necklace and the new Mercedes (What?)
Now I'm sure you tryna fuck with-

Twenty thousand bitches (Twenty thousand bitches)

Never in my feelings (Never in my feelings)
It's a rich nigga business (It's a rich nigga bidness)
20/20 vision, 20/20 vision

[Interlude]
Whenever people see me now, they go twenty thousand
And I see you must've started with like fifteen and now it be fifty five
So let's see, twenty thousand, three hundred and sixty five and twenty thousand
Man, I'm teaching mathematics

One hundred, gotta keep it one hundred
Gotta keep it one hundred
Gotta keep it one hundred
Gotta keep it one hundred
Gotta keep it one hundred
Gotta keep it one hundred
Gotta keep it one hundred
Gotta keep it one hundred
Gotta keep it one hundred
Gotta keep it one hundred
Gotta keep it one hundred
Gotta keep it one hundred
