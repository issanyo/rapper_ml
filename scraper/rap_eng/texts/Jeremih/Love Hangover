[Verse 1]
I miss, I miss, the more the more
I miss your lips, your kiss
Going down, on my
When we there, we the shit
Man, what happened to this?
This ain't right, this ain't real
I need you, I'm out here
I need you, I'm out here
I need you, I'm out here

[Bridge 1]
Cause I never filled the other side of the bed up
It's still empty just the way you left it, baby
I never wanna drink this pain I feel in my cup
But fantasy without you leaves me thirsty

[Bridge 2]
I miss you, I miss you
The more the more

[Hook]
Baby, oh, darling, girl
I'm so wrapped up in this love hangover
And your love, but so
Do I care? No
I want you back
So come get me off this love hangover

[Bridge 3]
I wake up, wake up, wake up
And think of how maybe it could be much better, baby
I'm still drunk, I'm still drunk, still drunk off your hope
Cause you know we belong together baby
