[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Zaytoven
IGH! What? Why you followin' me?
Where you think...?
Ain't you...? Ugh

[Pre-Hook: Chance The Rapper]
Why the hell you standin' front of me?
I swear you just said you was done with me
You still all tahm 'bout what you gonna be
Need to get some money
I shoulda left you

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I shoulda left you in 2016
I shoulda left you back in 2016
Now I shoulda left you back in 2016
They shoulda left you back in 2016

[Verse 1: Lud Foe]
Niggas been hatin' since 2014
'Cause they ain't wanna see a youngin' on the big screen
This shit ain't been the same since 2015
I lost a lot of people in 2016
The Lord told me they wasn't meant for me
The hoes won't get a red cent from me
If I get locked down would you sin for me?
She ain't go for you but she went for me
Ayy, look what you done done to me
Remember when they used to make fun of me
I pull up like trucks and they run from me
Blue cheese, yeah my pockets where the hundreds be
I ain't met a bitch yet say she done with me
Bitch keep tryna show me her tongue ring
I'm a king so she honor me
I still keep a stick like a pogo
You say you gonna rob me, that's a no-no
I still get them things in for the low-low
Yeah we got more pumps than a GoLo
Long nights in the skreets like a hobo
A nigga diss on me, he a homo
He claim he don't know me, but his ho know
The rap game ain't the same since Lud Foe
Since Lud Foe

[Pre-Hook: Chance The Rapper]
Why the hell you standin' front of me?
I swear you just said you was done with me
You still all tahm 'bout what you gonna be
Need to get some money
I shoulda left you

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I shoulda left you in 2016
I shoulda left you back in 2016
Now I shoulda left you back in 2016
They shoulda left you back in 2016

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Fuck 2016
I'm a boss, I got sauce, now she wanna striptease
Man I made it out the hunnids, I only count blue things
I only drive big wings, all I drive is big wing
Hit the studio with you, got 'bout 20 16s
We gon' leave all the rumors back in 2016
It must suck to be you, got your girls in the Lex, peace
Baby girl say she 20, actin' like she 16
Leave that fake flexin' up in 2016
Don and Blitzen on your baby, slidin' in them Vickies
Got a donkey on you, baby, can't believe it, Ripley's
Merry Christmas, space jammin', swear I got 'bout six rings

[Pre-Hook: Chance The Rapper]
Why the hell you standin' front of me?
G, go somewhere, would you lose my number please?
You still out tahm 'bout what you gonna be
Need to get some money
I shoulda left you

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I shoulda left you in 2016
I shoulda left you back in 2016
Now I shoulda left you back in 2016
They shoulda left you back in 2016

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
You a throwback with your old ass
Talkin' 'bout, "We go back"
You need to go back
To wherever, I don't give a fuck, go 'way
Leave your attitude at the doorway
Leave your ass too at the doorway
I ain't never like your ass no way
I ain't never like your ass, I ain't never like your ass
I ain't never like your ass no way
Why your ass workin' that same old tired ass job?
They ain't fire your ass in '08?
Now I'm 'bout to show your ass
Shoulda walked by your ass
I ain't tryna find your ass no way
Got too many bodies you a throw 'way
Rest in peace to great David Bowie
Please can we get back Prince?
Please can we get back Kim?
Bo Slice, boy I swear that they gave you life
Shoulda left your ass in the pen'
Please can we get back Craig Sager?
Leave your ass at the rim
Three feet, no pressure, no press, no questions
Actually one simple question

[Pre-Hook: Chance The Rapper]
Why the hell you standin' front of me?
I swear you just said you was done with me
You still all tahm 'bout what you gonna be
Need to get some money
I shoulda left you

[Outro: Jeremih]
I shoulda left you
I shoulda left you
I shoulda left you
I shoulda left you
I shoulda left, shoulda left you
I shoulda left you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
