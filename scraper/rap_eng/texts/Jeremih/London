[Verse 1: Jeremih]
You know my eyes up on your face (Face)
My hands up on your waist (Your waist)
I limbo go low-low-low-low
I might get me a taste
That Henny got me feelin' nasty
Go give me ride-ride like a taxi
I seen that ass just walk past
I couldn't let you walk past me (Whoa, no)
Girl let me take this somewhere we're naked
Forget 'bout what we do (Forget 'bout what we do)
Don't wanna wake up
Later tonight and
Not be right next to you (Not be right next you)
What is this feeling I cannot deal with
All I wan' feel is you (All I wan' feel is you)
All I wan' feel is you (All I wan' feel is you)
All I wan' feel is you

Hey, got the brand new coupe, for us you know (For us)
Never do you like the rest'll do (Never)
You got me thinkin' big family
And I wanna make you Mrs. Huxtable (Mrs. Huxtable)
You say you want things your way
Anything at all cause I'm close to you
We at the perfect time and place
What other time is time to play?

[Verse 3: Krept + Konan]
Wine 'pon it, climb 'pon it
Ride 'pon it, spend your whole bloodclart life 'pon it
Dive 'pon it, slide 'pon it
Wait, you broke me cocky now mi need fi put ice 'pon it
Grind 'pon it, fight 'pon it
Survive 'pon it
You can take a bloodclart flight 'pon it
You're tight 'pon it
Your wife 'pon it
Make her scream, "Jesus, Christ" 'pon it
Come for us, just come for us
Dun your talk, I'll dun your dance
Your bumper up, man spun the car
Bumbaclart, 'nuff ganja spark
Girl you're hot like a Sauna-na-na
Come get some banana-na-na-na
All these other girls have to pay homage
Coke bottle shape, I just wanna put my name on it
What you want me fi do?
Soon as you walk in the room
I know dem mad that I'm talking to you
When we're alone and it's me and you
You say your ting dem tight up
So climb on it, come climb up
Whine on it, come whine up
While I'm feeling your thighs up
