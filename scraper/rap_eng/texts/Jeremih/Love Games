[Intro: Jeremih]
Let’s play a game
Whatever start I kiss you right, you kiss me

[Hook: Jeremih and Ashanti]
You kiss me there, I’ll kiss you back
Let’s play a game
You got my front, I got yo back
You kiss me there, I’ll kiss you back
Let’s play a game
I kiss you there, you’ll kiss me back
Let’s play a game
I got yo front, you got…

[Verse 1: Ashanti]
Say you’re gonna kiss me when I kiss you right baby
I ain’t one of them girls that’s scared (I can’t)
And I’mma make you feel like you’ve never felt before
I’mma pull my hair back and give it to you one more

See in life I don’t like to play games
But because it’s you and I, I am here, I’m ready
So give me one hit, two hits, three hits, homerun
Put your hands all over me, said that it’s not funny

[Hook: Jeremih and Ashanti]
You kiss me there, I’ll kiss you back
Let’s play a game
You got my front, I got yo back
You kiss me there, I’ll kiss you back
Let’s play a game
I kiss you there, you’ll kiss me back
Let’s play a game
I got yo front, you got…

You know I’m finna get you back, baby

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
You can be head in charge
I just think…
Maybe we should play them games
Hide and seek
Might spin a little jiving
We can take it low
Yea, I let go off them dollas
If you can take that low
I just got an extra 5 yea, got you throwed up loose
I dare you to drop em
Girl we can skip the truth
Oh when I’m kissin you there while you kissin me back
Red light, green light, just like that
Using my fingers like finger I win
Switchin these positions like a twisted ending girl

[Hook: Jeremih and Ashanti]
You kiss me there, I’ll kiss you back
(You kiss me there, I’ll kiss you back)
Let’s play a game
(Let’s play a game)
You got my front, I got yo back
(You got my front, I got yo back)
You kiss me there, I’ll kiss you back
Let’s play a game
I kiss you there, you’ll kiss me back
Let’s play a game
I got yo front, you got…

You got my front, I got yo back baby
You got my front, I got yo back baby
Ha, the way you arch yo back
The way you lookin back at it man, I swear you ain’t felt it like this
