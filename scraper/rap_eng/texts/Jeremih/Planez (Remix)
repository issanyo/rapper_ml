[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Catch me rollin' through the city
Ridin' with the top off
Man my whip so big when you in it
Fuck around and get lost
Told my bitch let her hair down
What this shit cost?
Tell me baby if you about that life right now
Hope it ain't talk, no

[Refrain: Jeremih]
I can put you in the Mile High Club, what's up?
Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The World Is Yours"
On a blimp

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Tell her be free, baby spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane
Let me guide that, I'm the pilot
Can't nobody see you, 30 thousand feet
On your knees in them Prada's
Make the freaky shit come up out her

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Get high baby roll one, cloud nine, 'bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin' of turbulence get when we turn up
When we land we can roll out, show you something you don't know about
Tonight we be takin' off flight with a camera to show about

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
I got you in the air, your body in the air
How it feel up here?
You can scream as loud as you want, and loud as you can
And ain't nobody gonna hear it
Would you like it better
If we hit the west coast?
Tell me, baby, tell me if you 'bout that life right now
I hope it ain't talk

[Refrain: Jeremih]
I can put you in the Mile High Club, what's up?
Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The World Is Yours"
On a blimp

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Tell her be free, baby spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane
Let me guide that, I'm the pilot
Can't nobody see you, 30 thousand feet
On your knees in them Prada's
Make the freaky shit come up out her

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Get high baby roll one, cloud nine, 'bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin' of turbulence get when we turn up
When we land we can roll out, show you something you don't know about
Tonight we be takin' off flight with a camera to show about

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I got that golden ticket
We should just go and kick it, this the factory
Listen to Kells, order daiquiris
With your bitches, gettin' drunk as fuck
See a bitch I fucked, then get mad at me
Listen to Kels then get back with me
Cause I could fix broken bridges, she could never burn 'em
Yeezy taught her well, he ain't ever gonna learn her
You would be a liar if you said I didn't want her
But candy is so delicious, this shit sweet
I be hitting other bitches like this shit weak
This the worst pussy I had all week
But you got that golden ticket
Fuck the airfare we should have a affair
Life's real unfair to the ones scared
Life really ain't a game when it's one player
That's scary huh, very huh
Like it when I beat the pussy up like Jerry vs Tom
With a bat like Barry Bonds
She said she had too much baggage to carry on
You make me optimistic
We should just go and kick it
You got that golden ticket
We got some golden tickets, IGH!

[Refrain: Jeremih]
I can put you in the Mile High Club, what's up?
Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The World Is Yours"
On a blimp
