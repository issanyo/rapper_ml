[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Oh

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Jeremih]
I love the drank, and I got weed, nigga
Fuck what a nigga think, 'cause it's my body, nigga
I got bitches, got bitches, got bitches, if you need some (need some)
I got niggas, many niggas, if you need it, I'ma leash 'em (oh)

[Post-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Jeremih]
All I do is give (oh)
I just wanna take some time to be alone (oh)
All I wanna do is live
Yeah

[Verse: Jeremih & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Give it up to me and I won't beg you, baby
So many women took advantage, I can't trust this, baby
Trust issues, trust issues, I know
I know, I know
[?] the top, need the top in the row, made her fall right back
If I don't say nothing, nothing, then baby, I'ma want that ass
Baby, is this [?] easy
Baby, best believe me that

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Jeremih]
I love the drank, and I got weed, nigga
Fuck what a nigga think, 'cause it's my body, nigga
I got bitches, got bitches, got bitches, if you need some
I got niggas, many niggas, if they need it, I'ma leash 'em

[Post-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
All I do is give
I just wanna take some time to be alone
All I wanna do is live
Yeah
