[Intro]
Ohhh

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you all on my conscience?
Swear you don't know what you do
Got me thinkin' that I'm just
Maybe, I'm in love with you
Yeah, I heard all that nonsense (yeah, I know)
All them girls be all on you
But I ain't here for no contest, (uh)
When it comes to lovin' you

[Chorus]
All the time, understand
When I hear 'bout your name
I just like how we vibe
We should ride, we should hang
Let's go low like a Lambo
Speed, never brake
Boy, stop playin', up your game
Only me in your lane
('Cause some things)
We don't need to talk about
(All you need)
Is somebody to hold you down
Round the clock, runnin' laps, 'round my mind, night and day
I'm like damn, not complainin', I'm just sayin'

[Bridge]
Hardly ever speakin', it's been weeks, now where the time go?
I've been incognito and I blame it on the time zone
No one likes a shady nigga, shady niggas fall back (fall back)
But I'll give you the benefit of the doubt if you want that (oh)

[Pre-Chorus] (Jeremih & Tinashe)
Yet, why you all on my conscience
(why you on my conscience, baby?)
Swear you don't know what you do
Got me thinkin' that I'm just (baby, uh)
Maybe, I'm in love with you
Yeah, I heard all that nonsense, (yeah, I know)
All them girls be all on you
But I ain't here for no contest
When it comes to loving you

[Chorus]
All the time, understand
When I hear 'bout your name
I just like how we vibe
We should ride, we should hang
Let's go low like a Lambo
Speed, never brake
Boy stop playin', up your game
Only me in your lane
('Cause some things)
We don't need to talk about
(All you need)
Is somebody to hold you down (you down)
Round the clock, runnin' laps, 'round my mind, night and day
I'm like damn, not complainin', I'm just sayin'

[Outro]
You're all I need, you're all I want (you're all I need, you're all I need)
No fantasy, boy, you the one, hmm
Why you on my conscience now?
Why you all on my conscience?
(Your name, I just like how we vibe
We should ride, we should hang, let's go)
No one likes a shady nigga 'cause shady niggas fall back
Maybe, I'm in love with you, yeah
But I ain't here for no contest
When it comes to lovin' you
