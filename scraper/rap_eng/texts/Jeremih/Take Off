[Intro]
They say good things
Don't last forever
I guess they were right

[Verse 1]
Guess I really gotta let it go
Telling myself that this just not for me
Here we go around this merry go
Don't you understand that
One of us just gots to leave
So should I close the door
You take the key
Telling me I've been violent
Wishing I could rewind
How this broken heart
I can't believe
Didn't know how to make this work

[Chorus]
You know I thought I had it all y'all
It seems that I'm wasting time
Even though I've tried
Guess I've done it all wrong
I wish that I
Wish that I could help us
But I gotta take off, off, off
For once in my life
I gotta take off, off, off
It's time for me to break away

[Verse 2]
Baby we should let this curtain close
This is really nothing else that's left to show
It's like everytime you look we're starting over
Baby, we done it too many times before
Can't you see I had enough
All my love, maybe you didn't deserve it
Acting like you're miss perfect
I'm manning up, standing up
Cause I know you ain't been doing me right

[Chorus]
You know I thought I had it all y'all
It seems that I'm wasting time
Even though I've tried
Guess I've done it all wrong
I wish that I
Wish that I could help us
But I gotta take off, off, off
For once in my life
I gotta take off, off, off
It's time for me to break away

[Verse 3]
What am I doing?
Who do I tell?
I was blinded from the truth
That's why I stayed so long
I should blame myself
Girl, we used to be so close
But I gotta get far away
Baby, maybe we can roll
If I get far away

[Chorus]
You know I thought I had it all y'all
It seems that I'm wasting time
Even though I've tried
Guess I've done it all wrong
I wish that I
Wish that I could help us
But I gotta take off, off, off
For once in my life
I gotta take off, off, off
It's time for me to break away
