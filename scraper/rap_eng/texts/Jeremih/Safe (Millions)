[Intro]
Hitmaka

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Ohh, I just jumped on the Masi'
My niggas pulled off in the Wraith
I just popped me a Molly, my nigga, I'm so outta space
Comin' down, comin' down on me, oh no-no-no, that's the best
Comin' 'round, comin' 'round, you know none of these hoes in here safe
Hey, let a real nigga eat a plate
Little mama can't hit a plate
I be on, ain't no debate
Forgiatos smokin' when I skate
Jumped on the Masi',  my niggas rode off in the Wraith
Comin' 'round, comin' 'round, you know none of these hoes in here safe

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
None that these hoes safe
Stepped through the door
They, they all wanna roleplay
I just feel like Phil, gotta' make the play
Gorilla, don't need the BAPE
Probably in my section with your bae
Fuck with real niggas fuck the fake
I been eating on them ramen noodles
Now them niggas eatin' shrimp and steak
All you gotta know is nigga paid
And been movin' state to state to state
Now a nigga coppin' up estates
Super Marriott it don't need no cake
See your ass is a understatement
Talkin' straight shots to the face
All these hoes comin' my way
Tryna run around with my pay
(Running, around)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Ohh, I just jumped on the Masi'
My niggas pulled off in the Wraith
I just popped me a Molly, my nigga, I'm so outta space
Comin' down, comin' down on me, oh no-no-no, that's the best
Comin' 'round, comin' 'round, you know none of these hoes in here safe
Hey, let a real nigga eat a plate
Little mama can't hit a plate
I be on, ain't no debate
Forgiatos smokin' when I skate
Jumped on the Masi',  my niggas rode off in the Wraith
Comin' 'round, comin' 'round, you know none of these hoes in here safe

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Ayy, let a real nigga eat the plate
Let a real nigga buy you skates (yeah)

Ayy, let a real nigga eat the plate
Let a real nigga buy you skates (yeah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Have these cameras fuckin' up my zone, yeah
Pictures fuckin' up my dome, yeah

Can't wait to put it on ya'
Get it hot like Arizona
Feel it all in the aroma
Goin', goin' until the morning
Keep turning up, ain't going home yeah
Gone way too long, yeah

Matter fact, let's get it on
Really got me feeling somethin'
Really got me on a thrill
Really got me on a hill
Really got me on a chill, yah, yah, ohh

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Ohh, I just jumped on the Masi'
My niggas pulled off in the Wraith
I just popped me a Molly, my nigga, I'm so outta space
Comin' down, comin' down on me, oh no-no-no, that's the best
Comin' 'round, comin' 'round, you know none of these hoes in here safe
Hey, let a real nigga eat a plate
Little mama can't hit a plate
I be on, ain't no debate
Forgiatos smokin' when I skate
Jumped on the Masi',  my niggas rode off in the Wraith
Comin' 'round, comin' 'round, you know none of these hoes in here safe

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
