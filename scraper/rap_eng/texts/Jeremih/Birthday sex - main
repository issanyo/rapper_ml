It's your birthday, so I know you want to ride out
Even if we only go to my house
Sip on weezy as we sit upon my couch
Feels good but I know you want to cry out
You say you want passion and I think you found it
Get ready for action, don't be astounded
We switchin' positions, you feel so rounded
Tell me where you want your gift, girl?
Girl you know I, girl you know I, I been feenin'
Wake up in the late night, been dreamin' about your lovin'
Girl you know I, girl you know I
Don't need candles and cake, just need your body to make
Birthday sex, birthday sex, birthday sex, birthday sex
See you sexy and 'em jeans got me on 10
1, 2, 3, ding, I got you pinned
Don't tap out, fight until the end
Ring that bell and we gonna start over again
We ridin' with passion 'cause it's your birthday
Been at it for hours, I know you thirsty
You kiss me so sweetly, taste just like Hershey's
Just tell me how you want you gift, girl
Girl you know I, girl you know I, I been feenin'
Wake up in the late night, been dreamin' about your lovin'
Girl you know I, girl you know I
Don't need candles and cake, just need your body to make
Birthday sex, birthday sex, birthday sex, birthday sex
First, I'm gonna take a dive into the water
Deep until I know I pleased that body, body
Or girl, without a broom I might just sweep you off your feet
And make you wanna tell somebody, body how I do
Or maybe we can float on top my waterbed
You close your eyes as I improv between your legs
We work our way from kitchen stoves and tables
Girl you know I'm only able to please, yeah
Say you wanted flowers on the bed
But you got me and now it's on again
Girl you know I, girl you know I, I been feenin'
Wake up in the late night, been dreamin' about your lovin'
Girl you know I, girl you know I
Don't need candles and cake, just need your body to make
Birthday sex, birthday sex, birthday sex, birthday sex
