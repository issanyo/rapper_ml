[Intro: Cap-1]
Hello?
Yeah, what you on for the night?
Should grab a few of your homegirls and pull up
Let's get active

[Hook: Jeremih]
Baby whatchu doin' for the night? (for the night)
Tryna be your man for the night (for the night)
We could do the things that you like (for the night)
I just want to get you right
Girl tonight
Girl tonight
Girl tonight
Girl tonight
Yeah

Rich!

[Verse 1: Cap-1]
One text turned into drunk sex
Drunk sex turned into a confess
Legs up in the air left her body shakin'
Wake up in the mornin' with her body achin'
I got kisses where you want 'em at?
She told me a she a freak, I hit her from the back
Dig deep til she fall asleep
And wake her back up for a repeat
She said I hit the button like a retweet
And I just holla Bang Bang like Chief Keef
Hit the horn two times, beep beep
Then met her on the corner right on Peachtree
Yeah, that thing wetter than Dasani water
She dance for me I throw money on her
Heard I had a girl, but said she cool wit it
As long as I get in and act a fool in it

[Hook: Jeremih]
Baby whatchu doin' for the night? (for the night)
Tryna be your man for the night (for the night)
We could do the things that you like (for the night)
I just want to get you right
Girl tonight
Girl tonight
Girl tonight
Girl tonight
Yeah

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, 2 Chainz
All the bad bitches want coke
All my car filled up with smoke
I'm ridin' through the city with my driver
Shawty you need a rich nigga beside ya
Open up your thighs more, let me get inside more
Standin' next to me I guess you'll always be my side whore
To-night gon' be the night I sneak in through the side door
Told you I love your hair, what I got to lie for?
Mind over matter she wears mine
Anytime I walk in to the building I skip the line
Anytime I sip on some wine I intertwine
Told her put the dick in her stomach, gut and her spine
I, fresh out the foreign
Take two of these and call me in the mornin'
I'm from Atlanta, I'm up when the lights off
And Cap's from Chicago, all he wear is white sock

[Hook: Jeremih]
Baby whatchu doin' for the night? (for the night)
Tryna be your man for the night (for the night)
We could do the things that you like (for the night)
I just want to get you right
Girl tonight
Girl tonight
Girl tonight
Girl tonight
Yeah

Rich!

[Verse 3: Cap 1]
Baby whatchu doin' for the night?
That dress is fittin' right
Tryna fill my appetite
And you can get it how you like
She said she got a man, boy that nigga square
And I be everywhere, he ain't never there
Get you anything you can ask for
Take you cross the globe, get a passport (And what?)

Verse Simmonds:
Girl I got them joints all rolled up
Shawty got her ass all tooted up
Baby I'm a real nigga true enough
You know I'm cooler than a cooler
All my niggas down to ride
If your man flex it's a homicide
Countin' all them checks, better get it right
Tell me what you want, we gon' get it right

[Hook: Jeremih]
Baby whatchu doin' for the night? (for the night)
Tryna be your man for the night (for the night)
We could do the things that you like (for the night)
I just want to get you right
Girl tonight
Girl tonight
Girl tonight
Girl tonight
Yeah

Rich!
