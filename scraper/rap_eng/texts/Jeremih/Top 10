Hitmaka
Hold Up

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I'm that nigga, Goddamn
All my bitches in the top ten
Y'all let a nigga get bands
I'ma be your worst nightmare
Got rich, got boujee
Penthouse, jacuzzi
Don't wait, she choosin'
Good brain, she stupid
I'm that nigga, Goddamn
All my bitches in the top ten
Y'all let a nigga get bands
I'ma be your worst nightmare
Got rich, got boujee
Penthouse, jacuzzi, yeah
Don't wait, she choosin'
Good brain, she stupid

[Post-Chorus: Trey Songz]
She don't wanna leave now, no way
I just wanna freak down, no strings
She know how to bust down, no hands
Bust it, bust it down on 'em chicks
She don't wanna leave now, no way
She don't wanna leave now, no way
I just wanna freak down, no strings
She know how to bust down, no hands
Bust it, bust it down on 'em chicks

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Told her be herself (Yeah)
I know you a freak (Freak)
You know I'm a beast
Climb on top of me, fly for the week (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Biggin' up myself (Big, big up)
I'm so proud of me
Let you kiss the ring
You need you a king, I need me a queen
We're just somewhere gettin' money (Money)
Count it up, all the blue hunnids (Hunnids)
Wherever I go, she comin' (Comin')
Whenever I stroke, she cumming (Cummin')
Told her bring it right here, I want it (Want it)
Slippery here, no running (Running)
I'ma keep it 10 times Hunnid (1K)
Why these niggas always fronting?

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I'm that nigga, Goddamn
All my bitches in the top ten
Y'all let a nigga get bands
I'ma be your worst nightmare
Got rich, got boujee
Penthouse, jacuzzi
Don't wait, she choosin'
Good brain, she stupid
I'm that nigga, Goddamn
All my bitches in the top ten
Y'all let a nigga get bands
I'ma be your worst nightmare
Got rich, got boujee
Penthouse, jacuzzi, yeah
Don't wait, she choosin'
Good brain, she stupid

[Post-Chorus: Trey Songz & Jeremih]
She don't wanna leave now, no way
(She don't wanna leave now, no way)
I just wanna freak down, no strings
(I just wanna freak down, no strings)
She know how to bust down, no hands
Bust it, bust it down on 'em chicks
She don't wanna leave now, no way
I just wanna freak down, no strings
She know how to bust down, no hands
Bust it, bust it down on 'em chicks

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Pull up, nah, you ain't see this
Country broad, got a head on her
And her lil' pussy's patient
Bring her friend, that's the plan for me
Money on my mind, don't know what you thinkin'
Rollie with the crown, I told them king me
63 with the seats turnin'
OG, Cali' tree burnin'
Old faces, safe is running out of space
High key, I'ma let her know
Flickin' through the bands, I be dominos
Two phones, I've been doin' numbers though
I ain't really been the type to cuff
I was tryna spell it backwards tho'
Might sing on the camel toe
On the camera, she a-nah
Got her speakin' Spanish (Sshh)
Now I understand her
Know she got a nigga
But no, I'm not that nigga
Swear a porno model want the static
I'm like no, no, no sweat
Swear a porno model want the static
I'm like no, no, no sweat

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I'm that nigga, Goddamn
All my bitches in the top ten
Y'all let a nigga get bands
I'ma be your worst nightmare
Got rich, got boujee
Penthouse, jacuzzi
Don't wait, she choosin'
Good brain, she stupid
