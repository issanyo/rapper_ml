[Hook: Jeremih]
Oh hey, there she go
That's the one I've got to know
Such a cutie, right? Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you
How her hair flows when she walk
Like a Love Jones when she talk
Such a cutie, right? Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you

[Verse 1]
It seems like for a while I’ve know ya
Nostalgic moments, feels like magic don't it?
Girl you killin' 'em, my condolence
That's how you on it? Yeeaaah, that’s how you on it
And I'm gonna be with you no matter what it takes
Running with scissors in the traffic, tryna cut straight to the chase
Wanna be there when you wake, when no make up on your face
Not even gloss, before you brush, love your dimples when you blush
It's the simple things in life we take for granted cause we rush
I just wanna gain your trust as well as me giving you mine
What's yo sign? I'm an Aries, I'm a 90's baby, clearly
I'll make sure to make time for you though my schedule may vary
Hold up, hold up, hold up, I just wanna know ya
I heard 'em say that beauty's in the eyes of the beholder
Well girl my vision’s bad so I'm gon' need you to come closer
Closer, now you right here where you 'pose to

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Excuse me Misses, may I spark your interest?
Cause you sure got my attention, I just wanna grant you wishes (Lala)
What you want you get it, I don't call it tricking
Not just cause I got it cause I want to, that makes all the difference
I'm about my business, and ooh girl you the business
We should get together soon so we can do some business
I got some things that I could teach ya, lemme show ya
Is you ready, what's the hold up?
You ain't 'bout no drama, you remind me of my mama
Smelling like flower balm and escada, shut it down and you won't even try ta
You such a boss but carry yourself like a lady
The baddest out ya crew and that is not up for debating
Hold up, hold up, hold up, I know what they say
Every rapper only want that sexual healing Marvin Gaye
Don't believe it girl, I promise I'mma treat you like my treasure
I'm a movement by myself but I know you'll make me better

[Hook]
