[Chorus]
Let's take off the top, go hit the club
Do you know what it feels like to fall in love?
Take off your top, ready to fuck (girl)
Do you know what it feels like to fall in love girl?

[Bridge]
Neither do I
I say we find out, cover your eyes
Well go turn the lights out
I know you want it from the way you like to move, girl
Why you frontin' like you ain't got nothing to lose, girl?
I'm just tryna make a move girl
Get you in the nude girl
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I remember days when
This wouldn't go the same before I was famous
It's true we out here chasing bitches
Now I'm done with that
I came up and now I'm rich
I got sum'n wrong with that
But you different than these women
Got me coming back
Can't let anybody have you
Can't have none of that

[Chorus 2]
Let's take off the top, go hit the club
Do you know what it feels like to fall in love?
Take off your top, ready to fuck (girl)
Do you know what it feels like to fall in love?
Let's take off the top, go hit the club
Do you know what it feels like to fall in love?
Take off your top, ready to fuck (girl)
Do you know what it feels like to fall in love?

[Bridge]
Neither do I
I say we find out, cover your eyes
Well go turn the lights out
I know you want it from the way you like to move, girl
Why you frontin' like you ain't got nothing to lose, girl?
I'm just tryna make a move girl
Get you in the nude girl
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge 2]
Do you ever think about me when I'm not around?
Do you ever think about me when I'm not around?
Do you ever think about me when I'm not around?
Do you ever think about me when I'm not around?

[Chorus 2]
Let's take off the top, go hit the club
Do you know what it feels like to fall in love?
Take off your top, ready to fuck (girl)
Do you know what it feels like to fall in love?
Let's take off the top, go hit the club
Do you know what it feels like to fall in love?
Take off your top, ready to fuck (girl)
Do you know what it feels like to fall in love?
