[Verse 1]
House the first week when I hit ya
You say you're just playing, why your hands down there?
You know how we do it when we get up
Got em all actions, that my man right there
Come for me, I'ma eat, fill me up
I be with my girls like can you pick me up
To take me to your crib so you can pick me up
And I just climb on top, you be like giddy up

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, can't take your touch
I'm feeling your energy
You're more than just a friend to me
Ooh, you know how we party
If you get up, work me round [?]

[Chorus]
You've beent talking 'bout it all day
Now it's time for you to show me
Now look what you done started
You're my homie lover shawty, sh-shawty, sh-shawty
You're my homie lover shawty, sh-shawty, sh-shawty
You're my homie lover shawty
