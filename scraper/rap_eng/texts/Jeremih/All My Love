(Hook)
You say you want my love
You can have it all
Seems like you’re just my type, after all
I know you want a bad girl
Give him all of that
Take his heart, won’t give it back
I know you want all my love
I give you all of that
All of that, all of that, all of that, all of that

(Verse)
Your game hold weight like 18 wheeler
Tank on E come get your fill up
I can’t help she’s salty, cause you’re not with her
You look around but ain’t nothing realer, no
I ain’t here to stop it, so baby boy, don’t stop it
I like it my way, and my hips are just right here

(Pre-Hook)
If you never had it boy
You don’t know, you don’t know, yeah
If you never had it boy
You don’t know, you don’t know, yeah

(Hook)
You say you want my love
You can have it all
Seems like you’re just my type, after all
I know you want a bad girl
Give him all of that
Take his heart, won’t give it back
I know you want all my love
I give you all of that
All of that, all of that, all of that, all of that
