[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'

[Bridge: Buddy]
Hopefully we can go to heaven, I pray
Hopefully we can go to heaven, cause I'm staying
Hopefully we can go to heaven, I pray
Hopefully we can go to heaven, cause I'm staying, I'm staying

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Yeah, I got a dilemma, because it's a Saturday, wish it was Friday
Touch in the morning, confess to the Usher, she say she want my way
I don't want massing, no blessing tonight girl, been sinning for way long
If you gon' get on your knees, there's a problem that I gotta pay for
She know I'm down for anything, when she started popping that
I don't wanna bite that apple girl, cause it ain't no turning back
I don't know how I end up with all that ass up on her, what she did to me?
Tats on her, and it's tempting
Clap it, can I get a witness

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Say she wanna drink, do drugs, have sex tonight
But I got church in the morning, service in the morning
She say she wanna drink, do drugs, have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Girl you told me you had church in the AM (wake up)
Its a war going on so stay in
Homie caught a case, I seen him take 10
And I knew him since the playpen, AMEN
Got church in the morning
I pray for the poor, I wish she was rich
Plus she the preacher's daughter, ate a cornbread a cabbage
Ain't miss a Sunday mornin' [?]
Wishing me and her can go to heaven
Thinking I'm a devil in that Porsche 911
Talking to that pussy I'm just preaching like a reverend
We could only kick it cause we leaving at 11
Aw, why am I feeling god?
I just wanna do this, feed the fam
Shawty, she my angel cause she got me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Preach to 'em

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
She said
She say she wanna drink, do drugs, and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'

[Verse 3: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I'ma tell you flat out
Baby I want in
Maybe we could ride out
Before this song ends
Fuck your friends
I know they wanna fuck me too
Well baby we can fuck your friends
And if they down, baby I'm ready
G strings ain't shit but spaghetti
Smoking weed up like confetti
She said she want a real one
Well baby I'm the truth, yeah
Kinda like a young ass nigga named Jigga, mixed with Nas when he had the chipped tooth
If I rule the world, baby
I'd put in that work, but a nigga still gotta go to church

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight (she said)
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'

[Bridge: Buddy (BJ The Chicago Kid)]
Hopefully we can go to heaven, I pray (I)
Hopefully we can go to heaven, (we can go to heaven) cause I'm staying
Hopefully we can go to heaven, (yeah) I pray (I pray)
Hopefully we can go to heaven, cause I'm staying, I'm staying
