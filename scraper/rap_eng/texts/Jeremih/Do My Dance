(Verse)
Dance, dance, dance, on it
No worries when the lights off
Cause you know I know, oh, yeah
If you get on top, put the pillow tuck on my own, yeah
Get this girl with the window talk, yeah, I’m on it

Cause I whips whips right here
Whips whips right here
Get in shape when you got it
It’s time and time off when I’m in here
Uh-uh, bring them lights off
Spark close right there
Riding around with a bad bitch
Not just right here

(Pre-Hook)
No way, don’t know what you’ve done to me
I’ll be talking today, I’ll be talking tonight
How much time is gonna take
Boy, it’s time to take flight

(Verse)
Hey, I’m back to pay-pay
Nobody gonna make the heat
In need of one to make it, make it hot
So many dollars on me
That railway, that blue dot, yeah, we drank ‘em all, all day

(Hook)
Do my dance on your dick
Uh, you know you love this shit
Do my dance on your dick
Uh, you know you love this shit

I'mma do my dance on your chick
Uh, you know she love the dick
Do my dance on your chick
Uh, you know she love the dick

(Verse: Too $hort)
I pull her dress up on her waist, cause it’s hot
Now it looks like we’re fucking, but we’re not
She just bouncing on my dick like a trampoline
Got her hands in the air like a champion
If I let her keep going she ain’t never gonna stop
I don’t wanna dance, I wanna make that pussy pop
Turn your bitch into some working, make her squirt,
If you knew what she was doing you’d be hurt
This only one night I wanna spend with you, girl
So if I fuck her it’s not the end of the world
She’s wetter than the motherfucking Mississippi River,
You can’t forgive her?! That bitch

(Hook)
Do my dance on your dick
Uh, you know you love this shit
Do my dance on your dick
Uh, you know you love this shit

I'mma do my dance on your chick
Uh, you know she love the dick
Do my dance on your chick
Uh, you know she love the dick
