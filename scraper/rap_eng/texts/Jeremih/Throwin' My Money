[Intro: Jeremih]
She say “pay something, I’ll shake something”
You right – I’ll pay something, now shake something
Then she roll and I throw it (get paid, get paid)
Shake something, shake something…

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Shorty want me to blow my money
I say “baby, blow my mind”
Say she workin’ for a new watch
Baby girl, it’s your time
Damn, she got me throwin’ money
Even callin’ on me from overseas
I feel like Reggie Miller
‘Cause now I’m gettin’ these hoes in threes
Wish I had more time to play
But them vaginas is on the way
Ooh… girl…
Break it down, break it down…
Yeah, I started off with ones
Now I’m throwing these hundreds
(Throwing these hundreds)
The way she’s sliding down that pole
She just thirst for more money

[Hook: R. Kelly]
The way she work it on the pole
Got me throwin’ my money, throwin’ my money
They way she twerk it on the pole
Got me throwin’ my money, throwin’ my money
The way she pop it on the pole
Got me throwin’ my money, throwin’ my money
The way she slide down on the pole
Got me throwin’ my money, throwin’ my money

[Verse 2: R.Kelly]
I ain’t got no plans tonight
Get somewhere, you can help me get my head right
And I love your swag, cause it’s just like mine
Siamese twins me and you, we two of a kind
Strip club is our playground
She playing on her monkey bar
Up and down like a roller coaster
Call that ass a theme park
Way she handle her business
From the sky she make it drop
My money no limit, tonight I’m about to go astronaut
Never ride solo, Mr. Franklin always with me
She’d been around the pole so many times she should be dizzy
Rolex that’s real crime, these niggas exaggerating
Her ass can hold a glass, that’s no exaggeration

[Hook: R. Kelly]

[Verse 3: Twista]
Pop that booty, let me watch it girl
Drop it, I’ll not knock it
Better yet I’mma reach into my pocket girl
Watch it girl she sluggin’
Come over here cause I see what you do
Tippin off the plenty booze
How you be attracted to plenty dudes
With the Jimmy Choo shoes you in
What you doing takes some talent
So I gotta say that I’m enjoying what I witness
My money flow is endless
Lookin’ at her work that pole like gymnast
Climbin’ up to the top
Turn it upside down then open up her legs
Lookin’ sexy all the way to the bottom
I’m throwin’ dollars ’cause it look like she finna hit her head
Now she twerlin’ around it, then do a split right in front of it
Ready to go back up when she look at how thick the money get
She do it caterpillar, ballerina, diamond toes, aerial and vert
Full rockin’ it vertical, so fixed, fan kick
Pro pounds, windmills, stacks, spin in reverse

[Hook]

[Outro: Jeremih]
She say “pay something, I’ll shake something”
You right – I’ll pay something, now shake something
Then she roll and I throw it (get paid, get paid)
Shake something, shake something…
