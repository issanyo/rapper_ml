Big nigga from the big city and we shoot like Saudis
Bad boy mike lowry, ridin in them audis

Every whip no ceiling, fuck all your feelings
Pulled up in a hot coupe, excuse me, a drop coupe
I told Shawty hop in and she blew me like hot soup
Bow down to my gang bitch, these niggas, I bang with
Loyalty, royalty, now we're talking my language
Draped up, caked up, Woke up early and then blazed up
I done heard, I changed up but I grind hard, got my change up
