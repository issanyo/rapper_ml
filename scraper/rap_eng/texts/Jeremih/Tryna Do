[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
Are you comin' through? (Huh?)
Only here two days, I been tellin' you (I been tellin' you)
You been missing me (Yup)
And I'm proud of you (How?)
'Cause you could've gave in, fucked another dude
Tryna keep my word (Promise)
Out of all the girls (Got a bond)
You the one that I hate lying to (Damn)
I can get her time (When?)
When it's time to (Yeah)
She be like, I'ma come find you
(Ayy where the fuck you at, nigga?)
All I can be is me (All)
No time for negative energy (Nope)
Never hold back when you pleasing me (Never)
Fresh off the road, got you feeding me (Mmm)
Lick on the tip, that be teasing me (Ooh)
Fortune teller, how you reading me (Damn)
Do all the shit that I really need (Really)
I'm 'bout to give you the key to me (Guard with your life)
No complaints, wish me well (Well)
You balance me out like the scale (The dope)
What you tryna do? (To me)
'Cause you lookin' in the face of a nigga ain't takin no L's
Roll a blunt or two while I'm thumbin' through
She wanna get away, I'm her go-to
Pull up to the show, meet the whole crew
Glad I chose you (Question)
What you tryna do?

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothin like backseat action (Why you say that?)
It's cliché to fuck in the mansion (Duh)
Lose balance hittin' it when I'm standing (Woah)
Tell me how you wanna be demanding (Tell me)
I'm just tryna know, where you tryna go?
Got her sayin' shit like, "Boy, you just don’t know" (Ooh)
Lookin' like a snack from the corner store
We the perfect match just like ten or four (Whoa)
Wanna keep me? (Huh)
Then don't bring on a ho soon as a nigga walk through the door door (Don't do that)
Got you out in the West Coast
Got booked for a show, keep the room, gotta go-go (That road)
I'm a gangsta but we all need lovin' (Yeah, we all)
Pockets lookin' like a biscuit in the oven (They was big ones)
Is you down to have a threesome with your cousin? (I'm just askin')
Without thinkin' nothin' of it (Hah)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
What you tryna do? Me and you in the coupe
Lovin' you, touchin' you, huggin' you, fuckin' you
What you tryna do? Mm, mm, mm
What you tryna do?
What you tryna do? Me and you in the coupe
Lovin' you, touchin' you, huggin' you, fuckin' you
What you tryna do? Mm, mm, mm
What you tryna do? What you tryna do?
What you tryna do?
