[Chorus:]
Hi to the haters
I'll see you later
Please don't step on the gators
Do me a favor
Just keep hatin' on me... on me

[Verse 1]
Okay now, 5 4 3 3 2 1
We we got plenty... ya'll ya'll got none
You say you say you lookin' for somebody hotter than the sun
You probably probably like Ne-Yo but shawty I'm the one
I, I O U nawl U O me
Ya'll pop champagne... let's pop 3
Tryin' to get my bills up like John Seed
So girl you know I I'm not free

[Breakdown:]
No one ever thought up in the streets that I could hold it down
Talkin' that shit while I bring that heat and now I hold the crown
Even with all this weight on me could'nt bring me down
Go ahead and keep hatin' on me
So I can wave

[Chorus:]
Hi to the haters
I'll see you later
Please don't step on the gators
Do me a favor
Just keep hatin' on me... on me

[Verse 2]
5 4 3 3 2 1
We we takin' over fe fi fo fum
Yo know I know I got your speakers bangin' bangin' out your trunk
This drank that I've been drankin' got me feelin' kinda shhh
I'm tipsy... Ya'll miss me
And they hatin' cause I've been around the world like disney
Really... straight from the Illy
Can't nobody stop me now now now now

[Breakdown:]
No one ever thought up in the streets that I could hold it down
Talkin' that shit while I bring that heat and now I hold the crown
Even with all this weight on me could'ntbring me down
Go ahead and keep hatin' on me
So I can wave

[Chorus:]
Hi to the haters
I'll see you later
Please don't step on the gators
Do me a favor
Just keep hatin' on me... on me

[Verse 3]
Yo that be your girl that's jockin' me
Yo the bass in the drum that's knockin' me
Anywhere you go they watchin' me
Cause I'm fly as a birthday
Flockin' me
You got no property
And I got monopoly
And I can stack it up
While she can back it up
And nobody in the streets is stoppin' me
You see the shoes and the whip
With the chrome on the lip
They Hate
Or maybe it's the glare from lice on kit or the ice on my wrist
They stare
Shit, listen, I ain't get the manager but I don't see why they hate
Can u see why they Hate
I ain't gonna lie, they make you wanna run and tell somebody

[Breakdown:]
No one ever thought up in the streets that I could hold it down
Talkin' that shit while I bring that heat and now I hold the crown
Even with all this weight on me could'nt bring me down
Go ahead and keep hatin' on me
So I can wave

[Chorus:]
Hi to the haters
I'll see you later
Please don't step on the gators
Do me a favor
Just keep hatin' on me... on me

[Outro ]
On me, on me, on me, on me
On me, on me, yeah, oh
