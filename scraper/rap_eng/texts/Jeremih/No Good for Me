[Intro: [?]]
Yeah
ADP [?]

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
We never meet in the middle on anything
You are so selfish
Sick of your bullshit and your foolish ways
Girl that's real nigga symptoms
You never gave him the full course
You only gave him the samples
Girl, you make this hard on yourself
And this is not hard, it's so simple (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Only care about yourself (yeyah)
Give a fuck 'bout no one else (no no)
Gettin' better on my health
While increasin' all my wealth
Only care about yourself
I swear that your love ain't no good for me

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I swear that your love ain't no good for me
You know, you know
I swear that your love ain't no good for me
I swear that your love ain't no good for me
Only care about yourself
I swear that your love ain't no good for me
I swear that your love ain't no good for me (ooh)

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
I got you your condo
Then got you your car, girl, you know I remember that
If it wasn't for me, hoe
You wouldn't have seen or even afforded that
Ghost you in Gucci
And Louis and Loubees and Prada's and all of that
You keep being moody
And lately excuses is all that you giving back
Only care about yourself
Give a fuck about Chanel
Only wants to do yourself
Think you got it by youself
To you from bad to bad and boujee
Took you from Nando's to the jacuzzi
I was your fan, now you're my groupie
Never thought this be how you do me

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Only care about yourself (yeyah)
Give a fuck 'bout no one else (no no)
Gettin' better on my health
While increasin' all my wealth
Only care about yourself
I swear that your love ain't no good for me

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I swear that your love ain't no good for me
I swear that your love ain't no good for me
I swear that your love ain't no good for me
Only care about yourself
I swear that your love ain't no good for me
I swear that your love ain't no good for me

[Verse 3: Ebenezer]
That—That—That—That foreign isn't
Yours you lil bitch
Wipe your mouth, there's a little
Bullshit around your lips
Okay, yeah, I'm that bitter
'Cause I'm the one that put you on when I was that nigga
I tried my best so how the fuck you fuck with that nigga
You turn around, say "I never know how to act, nigga"
Ah—nah—nah—nah—nah—nah—nah
Now you're just another
Number, darling (just another one of these hoes)
When you get fucked over don't bother callin' (don't call my line)
I did right by you, I stood by you
I did things I didn't even like to
You're just way too selfish, yeah yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Only care about yourself (yeyah)
Give a fuck 'bout no one else (no no)
Gettin' better on my health
While increasin' all my wealth
Only care about yourself
I swear that your love ain't no good for me

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I swear that your love ain't no good for me
You know, you know
I swear that your love ain't no good for me
I swear that your love ain't no good for me
Only care about yourself
I swear that your love ain't no good for me
I swear that your love ain't no good for me

[Outro: Jeremih]
