[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Call me papi
That's my mamasito
She like it naughty
Bongo By The Way

[Chorus]
Yeah, she call me papi
That's my mamasito
She does it naughty
Wearing see-through
She want paparazzi
She flashing me tho
I go many party
I want to leave tho
That's why she call me papi
That's my mamasito
She nitty-naughty
She wearin see-through
Yeah, she got the sauce
No necesito
Yeah, she do it my way
Like I'm Carlito

[Verse 1]
Comin' to my crib, Uber or the Lyft?
She just want the sauce, all up in her ribs
I just give 'em love, Cuban with the stick
I just wanna know what them niggas did
I got drivers like a trucker trucker trucker
Won't you do me in my dooli baby?
Move that ass in circles circles circles circles
Swear that ass been hoola-hoopin' baby
Finger lickin', sweet as creme brulee
Puerto Rican mamis, Cuban linkin'
You know, damn well, yeah
Everytime we get bell-bottoms of the bottom baby
All these comma's accumulating
I don't give a fuck if you and you related
Forrest Gump, I'm running game, yeah 2 could play it
Four floors in my crib, elevator

[Chorus]
Yeah, she call me papi
That's my mamasito
She like to get naughy
Be wearing see-through
She like paparazzi
She flashing me tho
That's my mami, mami
She call papasito
Call me papasito
That's my mamasito
Started in the lobby
Ended in the suite though
Yeah, she got the sauce
No necesito
Yeah, she do it my way
Like I'm Carlito

[Verse 2]
Diamonds on my arm, cha, cha, cha
Hennessy then it's back-back-back
Who you think brought the sauce?
I be Sammy Sosa, them Barry Bond-Bond-Bonds
Got the work off the clock-clock-clock
Hit 'em with the Tommy, that's my jock
Shittin' on 'em, uh, ca-ca-ca
All these thirsty bitches, more agua
Throwing bread, biscuits
All my jewels up on Dipset
Kisses got me missing on my baby
No wonder they call it Mistress
Home alone with 2 sisters
We goin' though incest
I work you out, big steps
Up and down your body, bench press

[Chorus]
Yeah, she call me papi
That's my mamasito
She like to get naughy
Be wearing see-through
She like paparazzi
She flashing me tho
That's my mami, mami
She call  papasito
Call me papasito
That's my mamasito
Started in the lobby
Ended in the suite though
Yeah, she got the sauce
No necesito
Yeah, she do it my way
Like I'm Carlito
