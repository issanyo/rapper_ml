I gotta missed call from your bitch
She been plottin on me for a cool minute
She wanna' suck my dick, and I'm cool with it
I like girls in the shower, when it's wet and fresh
On my late-night thirsty, 'cause it was late-night and I was thirsty
Girl, I been to that county girl, I ain't tellin
Handcuff me to the bed, girl it ain't no belly
I keep a stack of hundreds like I keep a secret
If anything you were just exploring, you wasn't cheating
She got my number stored under fake names
Her nigga think she faithful, but she runnin game
YOLO, so take me out these Polos
And we can fuck from Uno to Ocho Only you got me feeling like this
