[Verse 1]
Please don't call my phone right now
'Cause I don't wanna answer
I'm too busy drinking and I'm talking to this dancer
If I pick up I know all you wanna do is argue
I don't, no, I don't
Don't know why you think you got
Me wrapped around your finger?
Maybe it's the cigarettes, the limes and all the liquor?
Girl, I hate to say it if you thought that I would miss you
I don't, no

[Chorus]
I'm not coming home, now
Don't wait up too long, now
Out here on my own, now
I'm not coming home (I'm not coming home)
I'm not coming home, now
Don't tell me to slow down
Order me one more round
'Cause I'm not coming home
I'm not coming home (yeah)
I'm not coming home (yeah)

[Verse 2]
They say that you don't know what you got until it's missin'
Girl, I tried to tell you but you never fuckin' listen
You ain't gettin' nowhere if you always burn your bridges
I don't, no, I don't
Why we even talkin' right now? I don't have the patience
All my friends are with me so I should be gettin' wasted
Who wants to spend all this time on pointless conversations?
I don't, no

[Chorus]
I'm not coming home, now
Don't wait up too long, now
Out here on my own, now
I'm not coming home (I'm not coming home)
I'm not coming home, now
Don't tell me to slow down
Order me one more round
'Cause I'm not coming home
I'm not coming home (yeah)
I'm not coming home (yeah)
I'm not coming home (yeah)
I'm not coming home (yeah)

I'm not coming home, now
Don't wait up too long, now
Out here on my own, now
I'm not coming home (I'm not coming home)
I'm not coming home, now
Don't tell me to slow down
Order me one more round
'Cause I'm not coming home
I'm not coming home
