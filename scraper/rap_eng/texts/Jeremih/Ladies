[Hook:Jeremih]
24 all the time
7 days on my mind
All I think about is (lovely ladies)
So here I go on this floor in this club
Then its on, Man it ain't nothing but (beautiful ladies)
Gotta keep a ten by my side
When I cruise down that Lake Shore Drive
And the night time comes alive
They say you don't know, okay you don't know
Well I guess I do, I guess I do,I guess I do (beautiful ladies)

[Verse 1 : Jeremih]
Okay wassup, I'm wassup first I was stuck
But now I'm in love cause when I pulled up
It was nothing but all (lovely ladies)
That's right them red bones with that gino head
Thick girls with them rhino legs
In their mid twenties
I can't believe overseas
The L-U-V , puerto rics
Japanese, no lebanese uh
Well it really don't matter what they be wearing
They look up in the mirror and they just keep starring
And know they sexy as
You can catch 'em in the club play, Rose
VIP, belly cold, lots of hoes I mean
Yeah that's all I got to I got no eyeballs
Chi town, I got you, but all em
I stay seeking for ones that be needing more
Even more, even yours
Sometimes I just need something closer
That's probably why I got one over

[Verse 2:Twista]
We're arrived there am I kicking it with Jeremih
In the club with a ho there am I
Don't know what to do with them
I'mma get 'em fucked up cause they all suck
Mama need me so fly, I be telling you the truth
Swag through the roof
Red bottoms loose, show 'em what you do
Cause you such a (We do this for the ladies)
When I'm sober but especially
If I go take a shot of my ciroc
I bet you taste like skittles and your body
Looking better than the bittles in the bottom of the pot
Take a ride in my Aston Martin and not the black jag
No need to ask her what she got the bougie for
Cause in the Gucci store I bought her black bags
24 hours I be thinking about her
How I wanna spend some time
I guess I'm making her mine
I wanna bump & grind with that (Lovely Ladies)
Take a cruise down Michigan
While listening to J E R E M I H
With my lady sorry if I can't (no)
And you know they really have her head gone
Cause I know good beauty
I don't know if I should pick a fatty
Or the one that got a lil booty
To the dark, or the light, to the brown
I'mma dash fast
All of them smart and they pass class
Look around the only thing I see is bad ass

[Hook]

[Verse 3:AK]
Hit the city in the maserati
Damn she got a beautiful body
A pretty red bone, legs long
The way you walk, girl you dead gone
Now put this number on your iphone
Here state in the ride on
Sending that beautiful lady to drive on
Slide on while flipping thru the Chi see
She was 5'3 thicker than a motherfucker
Tattoo on her right feet, not likely
She probably a pisces
Black but a little bit feisty
Tear drop on her right cheek for the night creep
Hit the button, let the top drop
Watch the cops spot,top knock
Little for ice spot
I got to hurry baby, chop chop
I think I love her too much
Because I already need a new flock
Then I pull up to the club on Dubs
Its A line for the (ladies)
So many beautiful ladies in the chi
Can you imagine them in one club
I'm in the middle of the flo'
From the back to the front door
I'm surrended by all these, all these
(lovely ladies)
Sometimes I need something closer
Drop her ass like a roaster
Two leave out , one come over
