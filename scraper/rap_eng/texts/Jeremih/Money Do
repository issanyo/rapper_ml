[Hook: Gucci Mane] x2
I don't have an ego, but my money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do
And I don't like to show off, but my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you!

[Verse: Jeremih]
We see you see us, okay, we be
Steppin' in this muthafucka 30 deep
One of us is bound to hit and take yo hoe
You come in here smelling like D&G
I come in here smelling like paper tho'
Come in here smelling like paper tho'
Fresh whip, fit, tapered up
Real niggas only know how to do this shit
Low key, a vice man taking us
High key ass man takin' up
His bank account so high I can't take a look
So we hit up the mall like I'm taking hoes
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/jeremih/-/money-do.html]
Takin' hoes, takin' hoes
Man, I'm destined to ball with this crazy flow
How can I dodge these crazy hoes
Playa of the month, chiller league
But niggas can't see me big, surely
But niggas can't see me big, surely
250 on the dash like skier me
Been been gettin' money like yearly
Clearly you ain't near me
Clearly you ain't near me
Flow sauce, they can't hear me
Till I get 200 more millio'
No Lucci line, and I gots to go

[Hook: Gucci Mane] x2
I don't have an ego, but my money do
And I don't have a big mouth but my money do
And I don't like to show off, but my money do
I got so many zeroes, I could bury you
