(Verse1 Mikey Rocks)
Hey man they all over me
All you alls go to sleep
Lay it down for the freaks

I'm lights out,sober free
Getting wasted totally
Do them strippers show them treats
Oh yeah? uh huh oh yeah?

All over me, all over me, all over me (all on me man)

(Verse)
It's ben gonna pop up, Do me proper
I fuck you 'til you need doctor
I'm a linger shopper,he a teenybopper
Poppin' crystals you wanna do no vodka
I'm young and flashy first and lastly
Shave their heads all thanks to Cassy
Ass shots like she was Nicki
Or is it real these hoes is tricky
Supper trippy, I can't call it they fake ballin'
And they keep playin' they paintballin'
And they fake poppin'
Keep from hoes, and you hate options
I'm doin' falls and I'm buying lean
You walk in Fendi and dont buy a thing
You mad 'til she tryna leave
She curious and she tryin things
She on the roll with that molly
Poppin' one and she wildin
Got no control of her body
Look at what you just started
And I still ain't tryin' man I still ain't tryin
No sweat ,I'm still on time
I ain't never laid her I ain't worn no cape
I don't save them hoes and I ain't lying

(Hook)
All,all,all over me
All,all,all over me
All,all,all over me
All,all,all ov- (on me man)
All,all,all over me
All,all,all over me
All,all,all over me
All over me, all over me, all over me (all on me man)
Hey man they all over me
All these hoes go to sleep
Like the watch, tottally
Get awat to somewhere free
I'm lights out,sober free
Getting wasted totally
Do them strippers show them treats?

(Verse)
Any know my birthday
Body shots she can get the first taste
Drink drink up up your thirsty
You tryin' to go home, not to first base
And I'm tryna stay in VIP let me see your ID
And I see I amaze you
Work it hurt me you heard me
Said they never saw it in the first place
And they say that you should never put a past
Now how about we get to foreplay
And now you can't have my last name
But you can scream my first name
When I flip her from the back
And we roam in the back
So you know I had to kill it in the herse way
Smoking in the purple, LA chill out
Cali fornicate, LA fille
Grabbing on the track like fray on phrase
Riding this motherfucker to the 808
Yeah I ball 'til it to my way
If you already know Jeremih
If you got that bomb go dedinate
You know I'm that guy and if you know that bomb
Then give me some tick ok,ok

(Hook)
All,all,all over me
All,all,all over me
All,all,all over me
All,all,all over me (on me man)
All,all,all over me
All,all,all over me
All,all,all over me
All over me, all over me, (all on me man)
All,all,all over me
All,all,all over me
All,all,all over me
All,all,all over me
Hey man they all over me
All these hoes go to sleep
