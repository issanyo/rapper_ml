Part I
[Intro]
And you already know...who it is
Bongo By The Way

[Verse]
Mami got the besos so loca
That ass fit just like my sofa
Wait, I slide all up in that chocha
Yeah Moet, OJ, that's mimosa
Como te llamas
Swear that ass would fit well in designer
Might share the location to me casa
We gon' get it until ma√±ana
Where you get it from? Is that your mama?
All she wanna do is count the commas
When she bend it over, hey Ms. Parker
She keep coming back, I call her Karma
Get you strokin' all up in your agua
Rock the boat, row row
My new bone, raw hoe
Mix the Henny with the tron
Ice Tea, Coco (oh)
I got horses everywhere
'Rari, Polo
Say she wanna trap, I treat a baddies like a thot (oh)
Breakin' bands, throwin' nuts
Who the man? Heard you're not (oh)
Underdog on top
All my dawgs gon' bark
Five stars, now we gon' put the days in
Countin' paper like I'm flippin' pages
I'ma gucci in my Gucci France
Own my sun if they throwin' shades (oh)
Bruce Wayne, Dark Knight (You know it) (oh)
IPhone flashlight
Let's blow a bag, bagpipe
Heh, yeah that's right
She be doing the most
Ride the dick like she do rodeo
Who the baddest? She the definition
Reeling man, I be goin' fishing (oh)

[Bridge]
Quesos, pesos, cheddar, sheesh!
Turks and, Caicos, high in the, suite!
Blowin' besos, mamis, sheesh
Boricuas y morenas, comin' in, 3's

Part II
[Interlude: Female Voice]
It's cinco de mayo bitch, I'm tryna get pick'd and get dick'd
Retro Future

[Chorus]
Wouldn't tell her to wait up, I will say see you later
I'm not tryna lay up, Late-Late Night I hope you stayed up
Tryna up my come up, moonlight 'till the sun up
Yeah we on the come up, we ain't tryna turn down

[Verse 2]
Calvin Klein, your bras and panty, I'm just tryna see cake
Long tee, PJs, show you're riding with me these days
Coolin' wildin' with my Fulianos, rollin' while rollin' my Forgiatos
Let's go duck and take you Puerto Plata
Even go through customs for you, some gelato
Don Julio, Blanco in my system
How I'm ballin' sweatin out my pores
Tryna swim up in some shores
Got to white girls, we make smores
Benjis, how they come up missing
She just might be a magician
Hope you got your racks up
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them tities

[Chorus]
Wouldn't tell her to wait up, I will say see you later
I'm not tryna lay up, Late-Late Night I hope you stayed up
Tryna up my come up, moonlight 'till the sun up
Yeah we on the come up, we ain't tryna turn down
Wouldn't tell her to wait up, I will say see you later
I'm not tryna lay up, Late-Late Night I hope you stayed up
Tryna up my come up, moonlight 'till the sun up
Yeah we on the come up, we ain't tryna turn down

[Verse 3]
I won't tell a broad what your bitch did, bitch did
Wanna hit it raw, should I risk it, risk it
Pass it to my dawgs like a biscuit, biscuit
Shawty holdin' some, let me frisk it, frisk it
Oh, say it ain't so
Shawty do that on that pole
She got her hands to the floor
Loco how low can she go
Ooooh I seen her from raw, she so cold
She got a man, she say no
She brought her friend and she so-so

[Chorus]
Wouldn't tell her to wait up, I will say see you later
I'm not tryna lay up, Late-Late Night I hope you stayed up
Tryna up my come up, moonlight 'till the sun up
Yeah we on the come up, we ain't tryna turn downWouldn't tell her to wait up, I will say see you later
I'm not tryna lay up, Late-Late Night I hope you stayed up
Tryna up my come up, moonlight 'till the sun up
Yeah we on the come up, we ain't tryna turn down
