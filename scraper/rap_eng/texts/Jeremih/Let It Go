[Intro]
You want to let it go, let it go
You want to let it go, let it go
Let it go, oh

[Verse 1]
Don't wait
No lights flashing like this your stage
Kill 'em in the storm in the call for you
'Til the middle of the night, steady keeping's what we do

Got the shots of Ros√©, yeah, we pass that 'round
On our tour thing in the morning
And I know my baby can't do it like you
'Cause I know everything that you do times two

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, do you like that?
I love the way you hold me down
You know that I'll be right back
Right back long as you hear that sound

And I know my baby don't do it like you
'Cause I know everything that you do times two

Oh yeah, oh you like that?
No, I like that, I love the way you hold me down
You know that I'll be right back
Be right back, as long as you hear that sound

[Post-Chorus]
No, no, no, no
Take away, take away
Take away, take away

Oh no, baby
No, take away, take

[Verse 2]
I know you feel it in your body
I know you feel it in your love
Baby, tell me that you ready
I know you feel it in your love

You know I go...
Like that, oh yeah

[Outro]
Lights out, lights out, baby
Lights off, lights out, babe
Anything's yours
You never felt this before
Never felt this before, no

Lights out, lights out
Lights out
You never felt this before, no
I never felt his before

Tears gone cold
And you washed it away
Just take off your clothes
Oh no, no, no, no, no
No more

Baby, let it go
