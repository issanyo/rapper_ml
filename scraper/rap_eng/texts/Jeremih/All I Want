[Verse: 1]
Girl what you thinking?
With a body like that
Make a nigga like me
Spend a weekend
You can take off work
I'll pay you for your time
I ain't tripping
Beat it from the bed to the kitchen
Big dog, I ain't playing with you kitten
And I got a lot of money for the tipping
She got a lot of booty she gone do it like a stripper
And all that I know is she bad and she know it
She down and she going, oh yeah
Know I got the foreign parked up outside
You should be on the passenger side

[Chorus: 1]
All I want to do (All I want to do)
All I want to do (See you take it to the floor)
All I want to do (All I want to do)
See you drop it down low
Aw yeah

[Verse: 2 - Jeremih]
Plenty girls all in this place
All of that but nothing in here stopping me from looking all up in your face
Grabbing on everybody tell me how did my hands end up right below your waist?
Loving that, loving that, Billie Jean you gone love me back?
Dirty Diana I'll call you back for our own after-party
You ain't gotta worry about nothing no more
We do something or another take it to the back and you can shake it down low
And you can ride it out, ride it out (rodeo), ride it out, ride it out (rodeo)

[Chorus: 2]
All I want to do (All I want to do)
See you take it to the floor
All I want to do (All I want to do)
See you drop it down low
Aw yeah baby

[Bridge]
All I want to do (All I want to do)
See you take it to the floor
All I want to do (All I want to do)
See you drop it down low
Aw yeah

[Coda]
Yeah
Its the society
BBS that is
