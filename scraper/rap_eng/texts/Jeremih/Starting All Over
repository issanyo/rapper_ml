Uh huh uh huh
To feel a new touch, to smell a new scent
To learn a new love, the kiss of new lips
To build a new trust you know that's hard to find with people now a days
Id say that I'm so glad to find a new valentine

[Chorus:]
To start all this all over
Without no vision or way of how it's suppose to be
See back then I was real young but now I'm much older
So I won't make no mistakes
Back then I just couldn't see
I'm thinking that we need a harmony
Uh huh uh huh
So this is the perfect harmony
Uh huh uh huh
For this melody

To see a new face, to hold a new hand
To live a new life, to be a new man
To win a new heart you know that cupids arrows not right all the time
But your smile is like the sun that rise
So girl I won't mind

[Chorus:]
To start all this all over
Without no vision or way of how love suppose to be
See back then I was real young but now I'm much older
And I won't make no mistakes
Back then I just couldn't see
I'm thinking that we need a harmony
Uh huh uh huh
Seem like it's the perfect harmony
Uh huh uh huh
For this melody

I'll gently take your hand
And try this love thing once again
But gotta take our time and share each moment, day and night
Or else it just slips away
Oh slips away
So are you willing

[Chorus:]
To start all this all over
With several vision and ways of how loves suppose to be
See back then I was real young but now I'm much older
And just won't make no mistakes
Back then I just couldn't see
For this here I'm a need a harmony
Uh huh uh huh
You help me make the perfect harmony
Uh huh uh huh
For this melody

To feel a new touch, to smell a new scent
To learn a new love, the kiss of new lips
