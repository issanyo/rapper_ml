[Intro: Chance The Rapper & Jeremih]
Come on we gon' do it (let 'em know)
Come here
You know how we do it
Kick, kick, foot down (uh)
Kick, kick, don't look down (this one's, this one's for you)
Take a step back, come back around
Who taught you how to step?
Go ahead, go ahead

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Know this Christmas, baby
I can't let this song come between friends
If I'm part of your holiday plans
Let's roll down Lake Shore Drive
Let's dance, on down Michigan Ave and hold my hand
Take a red line from 95th to the End
Let it snow, let it snow now
Don't skip the Ãœber, I'ma pick you up
Everywhere I'm going, anywhere witcha
I'm gonna get money till it brinks the truck
Will you be my honey in love, we get stuck
We've been through problems, we've been test enough
Drinks to the sky, we gettin' fucked up
'Tis ain't the season without the one you love

[Hook: Jeremih]
If I'm your Santa, just call me Santa
Slide down your chimney babe
Turn your fireplace off
Who got your hand?
Can I dedicate to this last dance?
When was the last time you got romanced?
Here's a present for you

[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
Come on we gon' do this
Come on we got this
Come on, come on
It goes kick, kick, foot down
Kick, kick, don't look down
Take a step back, turn around
Who taught you how to step?
Who taught you how to step?
Kick, kick, foot down
Same damn thing, don't look down
Take a little break, come back 'round
Who taught you how to step?
Who taught you how to step?

[Hook 2: Jeremih]
If I'm your Santa, just call me Santa
Slide down your chimney babe
Turn your fireplace off

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
(keep it all for Santa baby)
The weather done got me in the spirit
The kids will be up any minute
We gon' put the presents under the tree (we gon' do that)
But 'til then girl, you're all to me
And I can't (can't wait for it)
I can't (can't wait for it)
I can't (can't wait for it)
I can't (can't wait for it)

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]
I said kick, kick, foot down
Do the same thing, don't look down
Take a step back, look around
Who taught you how to step?
Who taught you how to step?
Kick, kick, ugh ugh
Do the same thing, I ain't gotta look down
Nigga slide back, look around
Who taught you how to step?
I taught you how to step
