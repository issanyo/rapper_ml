[Denver Jonez: Unknown]

[Hook: Jeremih] I apologize, I recollect your name!
Oh baby I don’t know your name!
And let me tell you that ‘em heels
Really complement your frame!
Look at your body baby!
Uhuu, ah, and i gotta catch my plane!
Say you miss me and you wishing for some private time
Girl, can we get that way?


[Verse 1:Denver Jonez] Way before my time
Berore making rhymes
Would try to find a quick job just to make a dime
Sometimes it didn't work, cuz talk is cheap
Rode my bike around town in the scorching heat
Then I met this girl, she was really sweet
Pretty eyes, cute face, braces on her teeth
What should I say? Because I'm kinda nervous
A girl this pretty, is definately worth it
Tried to scratch the surface
She's picture perfect
She's really sweet, and I want her to know it
I gotta show it
Don't want to forget her
We'll go any place anytime in any weather
Denver (lol)

[Chorus:Jeremih]
I apologize, I recollect your name!
Oh baby I don’t know your name!
And let me tell you that ‘em heels
Really complement your frame!
Look at your body baby!
Uhuu, ah, and i gotta catch my plane!
Say you miss me and you wishing for some private time
Girl, can we get that way?

[Verse 2:Denver Jonez] She's playing "Hard To Get"
That's a quick fix
Tell her to "come here", give her a quick kiss
Run my fingers through her hair and tell her this: "Damn girl you're bad, you're someone I would miss"
The type of girl to make me cry when I'm sad
The type of girl that makes me feel bad when she's mad
I need some sympathy
Please come get with me
I will make you light up brighter than a Christmas tree
I'm not a G, or pretend to be
So you are doing something right if you get with me
Go hard 100 percent
Never on the bench
You can get with me
Iwill pay your rent
That's enough spent
(LOL) Denver

[Chorus:Jeremih]
I apologize, I recollect your name!
Oh baby I don’t know your name!
And let me tell you that ‘em heels
Really complement your frame!
Look at your body baby!
Uhuu, ah, and i gotta catch my plane!
Say you miss me and you wishing for some private time
Girl, can we get that way?

[Verse 3:Young Mix] Dang, she got me so speechless
Everytime I look at her she got me heavy breathing
I don't believe it
Vividly a genius
The images that she be showing, nobody has seen it
Dang you are so dreamy
Making love easy
Call me anytime I'll be there when you when you need me
I love it baby girl, our interaction
Keep your body rolling cuz you are the main attraction
I cannot imagine
Do it with no practice
We can make a movie and you can be the action
The only thing I'm asking
We play it like it's Madden
Check it, check it baby girl, watch a brother cash it
M.I.X

[Chorus:Jeremih]
I apologize, I recollect your name!
Oh baby I don’t know your name!
And let me tell you that ‘em heels
Really complement your frame!
Look at your body baby!
Uhuu, ah, and i gotta catch my plane!
Say you miss me and you wishing for some private time
Girl, can we get that way?
