[Intro: Jasmine V]
Just stay here with me one night
Just one night

[Verse 1: Problem]
Whaat, don't know if I can but I'll try
You know I love that little look in your eye you gave me
Here's the keys to my coupe, go drive me crazy
Gotta rahhh for them boys if allowing me ain't me
[?] through the jungle, don't try to play me
Cause I'm a diamond lane nigga out the CPT
Remotely controlled by C-A-S-H
Like a lot of cheese on my BLT
Varsity tryna see what that JV taste like

[Verse 2: Jasmine V]
Baby I'm the one to make your day
I'm the one to make your bed
But baby you'll never know it
Way you runnin' round here yeah you never know it
I know you 'bout your bread
But don't you know I'm on your head
Baby look at me
If you never knew you know I'm all you need

[Bridge 1: Jasmine V]
I knew you gotta bank roll
Everyday's a pay day and everything is paid for
I just really wanna see if you can chill and lay low
California saki sippin' while we're eating mangoes
Baby I'm tired, where's the mai tais
Where's the party hands up, you just give me high fives
Like I really want you now but I don't really know why
Hoping everything change when you see me eye to eye

[Hook: Jasmine V]
Just stay here with me one night
Just one night
Please stay here with me one night
Just one night
Stay with me tonight
Baby stick around and we can get it right
Stay with me tonight
Baby stick around and we can get it right

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
Girl tell me where you're headed, headed, headed
(Show me where you goin', if you wanna hide I'll be right with ya)
Tell me is you ready, ready, ready
We can do whatever, especially if you talkin' bout a night with ya)
You know I'mma have it, have it, have it
Anything you need, anything you want
Know it's right with me
Body on your body, come slide with me
You gon' need you more than one night with me

[Bridge 2: Jeremih]
Know I gotta bank roll
Everyday's a pay day and everything is paid for
I just really wanna see if we can chill and lay low
Jamaica we be jamminâ€™ up in Montego
Sunset drivin' while we in a Range Rov'
And we can do whatever all you do is say so
I really want you know and I don't even know why
Hopin' things change when you see me eye to eye

[Hook]
