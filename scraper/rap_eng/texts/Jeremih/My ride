Even if you don't like me
I bet you fall in love with my ride (my ride), my ride (my ride)
Got girls wanna be wifey
Cause they fell in love with my ride (my ride), my ride... ehh

[Verse 1]
Okay I pull up to da club, on them scotty pippin's
You say you got dubz, well I'm thirteen mo inches
These chromed out wheels got yah'll haters out there squintin'
When I hop in that club line, I ain't lookin for no friendships
Got Clyntell pipes, custom tint up on my windows
My air vents sealed, so I never lose no indo
Who's trailing me? my kin-folk, we weavin through the streets
And the flows like the wind, how it be breathing through these beats
And my seats, got my name on it
Yeah I know you ain't on this
Sparkle custom paint on this
On that drop top, frame on this
The grill is exclusive, and the rides all implusive
The only one that's whippin' this is singer slash producer
Say you wanna get drunk, I gotta bar up in my car
I never get bored wit foreign broads up in my car
So when it's master time I'm goin hard up in my car
Touch down a hundred yards up in my car

Even if you don't like me
I bet you fall in love with my ride (my ride), my ride (my ride)
Got girls wanna be wifey
Cause they fell in love with my ride (my ride), my ride... ehh

Is it the chrome up on my wheels, or that base up in my trunk
Chrome up on my wheels, or that base up in my trunk
Is it the chrome up on my wheels, or that base up in my trunk
Base base up in my trunk, base- base up in my trunk

[Verse 2]
Now when I'm cruisin' in my whip, damn right I crank my cd
Got three groupies on deck, and they all beggin to see these
They saw the navigation system and all of my tv's
Said they boyfriends whip was better, hell naw you must be Stevie
You see me, these stunner shades got me seeing 3D
Dope boys know I'm pushin' more crack then Petey
Though my gas tank on E-Z, I'm buyin up more Wee-zy
Please believe me, u chillen wit a Star-r-r
Hop in my Car-r, I hit the after party
What goes down between us, girl I won't tell nobody
Either in my Lac, or in my Maszaradi
Just wait till I pull into the lobby (lobby) lobby

Even if you don't like me

Base base up in my trunk, base- base up in my trunk

[Verse 3]
So if you wanna ride (ride), then baby we can go down town (go down town)
Girl with that pretty face (face), I might just let my windows down (my windows down)
So all my homies can see just who I get to ride with (ride with) ride with
And if you ever lonely then sweet baby girl hit my sidekick-ickk cause...
