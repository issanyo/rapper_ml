[Intro: Jeremih]
Hitmaka
Ooh
Shut up (Hol' up), yeah

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
What kind of nigga do you take me for?
Ooh, is it my fault that I like to stunt 'cause I got this shit on my arm?
And you can't play me
A nigga can't shade me
If it can't fade me
You know this shit ain't me
So you can't blame me
If I act a little different

[Chorus: Jeremih]
These days
Things a little different these days
Feel a little different these days
Same old nigga
Same old nigga
I just move a little different these days
Things a little different these days
I gotta think a little different these days
Same old nigga
No I'm not trippin'
I just move a little different these-

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Day after day go by
Can't nobody change my mind
I got money on my mind, yeah, yeah
'Nother woman tried to bang my line
Told her don't waste your time
Ooh, look a nigga in his face
Damn, he had shit to say (Na, na, na)
Nigga try to take my place
Shit'll get lit today
Shit'll get a little crazy

[Chorus: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $ign]
These days (These days)
Things a little different these days (These days) (Ooh yeah)
Feel a little different these days (These days) (Oh)
Same old nigga
Same old nigga
I just move a little different these days (These days) (Ooh woah)
Things a little different these days (These days)
I gotta think a little different these days (These days)
Same old nigga (Same ol)
No I'm not trippin'
I just move a little different these- (Hold up)

[Outro: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $ign]
What kind of nigga do you take me for?
Ooh, i-i-i-is it my fault that I like to stunt 'cause I got this shit on my arm?
Ooh, look a nigga in his face
Damn, he had shit to say (Na, na, na)
Nigga try to take my place
Shit'll get lit today
Shit'll get a little crazy
These days
