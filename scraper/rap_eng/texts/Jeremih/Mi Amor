[Chorus]
Hola Mi Amor
All I need's some more
Of you
Never been so sure (Yeah, yeah)
Leave me, won't know what to do

[Post-Chorus]
Wouldn't be the same with you not around, I'm not myself
Can't stand around seeing you with someone else
You know you can call for anything, you got my help
I been waiting too long, all alone by myself

[Bridge]
You know when you're in my arms, it feels so much better
All I could say the first day that I met her

[Chorus]
Hola, Mi Amor
All I need's some more
Of you
Never been so sure (Yeah, yeah)
Leave me, won't know what to do

[Post-Chorus]
Wouldn't be the same with you not around, I'm not myself
Can't stand around seeing you with someone else
You know you can call for anything, you got my help
I been waiting too long, all alone by myself

[Verse]
You know your lips made for my lips
I would kiss, wish we can turn time
I know you gotta a sea ful of Chanel
But you on a bigger wave than Moschino
You like to match your hair with your nails
You know what I'd do for you that he won't
Your lifeline on the IV
Who can make the beat to your heart beat?
We need to be together, why you can't see?
How can it be? Look at me, down to one knee

[Bridge]
You know when you're in my arms, it feels so much better
All I could say the first day that I met her

[Chorus]
Hola, Mi Amor
All I need's some more
Of you
Never been so sure (Yeah, yeah)
Leave me, won't know what to do
