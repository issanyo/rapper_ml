(Intro - Maejor)

Sex on my mind thinkin' 'bout
When I get you alone
You already know it's goin' down
When I get you alone
You know what i came here to do
When I get you alone

(Intro - Jeremih)

Get you
Get you
Get you
Alone

(Verse 1 - Senseless)

We're all going to a summer
Party
Living it up
We're only getting started
And we're gonna get drunk
Cos it was all good
While It lasted

And she says she wanna
Carry me
I rejected it
Cos I've just had enough
Of it
Mad beaches, drinks
Sunglasses
Fill my glass up
We're gonna get busted

And now it's getting freaky
Like she feeling all alone
She wanna meet me
Tryna sort this out
But trust me I don't have to moan
And all she wants is
To see F.O.A.M

I bet you didn't see that
Are you mad?
Be truthful
Listen to the facts
Tonight just let it go
I won't fall into that trap
I don't even wanna know

It's the summer of love
Ddark
Live tonight like its
Your last
You gotta stand strong
Sometimes it's not enough
Found another and its
Kicked off true trust

This is it now
Take me home
Outside my house
Don't act drunk
Kept it real from the start
I'll be there when true love
Turns to lust

Now I'm rolling like a rolo
Chasing it down that's a no no
I'll be chasing my dreams
Tryna make it
Don't try and be too social

I'm from the south side
Need to link up
You're from the outside
Lets just drink up
Don't smile up in my face
Cos I know you can't stand me
You should just sit down

(Hook - Maejor)

Sex on my mind thinkin' 'bout
When I get you alone
You already know it's goin' down
When I get you alone
You know what i came here to do
When I get you alone
I'ma give it all to you when I get you

(Verse 2 - Senseless)

We're all going on another
Journey
Tearing it up
We're getting loads of earnings
I've seen things change
Let's just keep it all the same
Don't wanna fade away

Now she wants to keep me
I ain't having none of it
She's getting way too needy
They say you're too young
But I say I love her deeply

Then You end up in the
Deep sea
Keep  things simple
Fuck the way you treat me
Now I'm moving fast
Like Hamilton
Even Since my first beat

I took time out but
I'm back now
Back for good
I'm better than before
So Tonight just let it go
When I get you alone
I won't fall into that trap
I don't even wanna know

(Hook - Maejor)

Tonight I need some entertainment
When i get you alone
Take all them clothes off let's get naked
When I get you alone
Baby let me kiss you somewhere sacred
When I get you alone
I'ma give it all to you when I get you

(Verse 3 - Maejor)

You know it, you know you in trouble, when I get you alone
Thinking 'bout the places I touch you, when I get you alone
And we can turn the cellphones off baby, when I get you alone
Cause everything you need is right here, right here, right here baby

Cause I'm tryna see what's up with tonight
And I love the way your body looks up underneath these lights
So don't say it's wrong, when it feels right
Cause I'm looking at your apple and I wanna take a bite

Sex on my mind thinkin' 'bout
When I get you alone
You already know it's goin' down
When I get you

(Hook - Maejor)

Sex on my mind thinkin' 'bout
When I get you alone
You already know it's goin' down
When I get you alone
You know what i came here to do
When I get you alone
