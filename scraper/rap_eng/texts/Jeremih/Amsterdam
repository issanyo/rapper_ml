[Intro: Female]
Jeremih, Late nights: Europe

[Hook]
Under the redlight, you mean, ain't no stopping here?
She told me that's right
You want all of my attention, no at ease
Told me what you want, I get you on your knees
I got so much work overseas they need the visa
My neck, my wrist, looking flashy like the police
Pull them titties out, swear I was in Ibiza
Taking shots now so I know you aim to please

[Verse 1]
I hit the top floor in the Presidential suite
Looking down on you, yeah all you haters
Told them no more sauce, I'm out of favors
It ain't 'bout the check up, then don't talk to me
Niggas claiming they got hoes, but they pop to me
Your hoe for my hoe, that's not a swap to me
According to my rollie, got no time for it
Since I was young, I had a dime, no dime for her
On her hands and knees is all she down for
(Ayy she with the shits
Backwood after backwood
Greyhound, she be lit
Is it really that good?
Don't make me admit
Chose me, class closed
Then we made a hit)

[Hook]
Under the redlight, you mean, ain't no stopping here?
She told me that's right
You want all of my attention, no at ease
Told me what you want, I get you on your knees
I got so much work overseas they need the visa
My neck, my wrist, looking flashy like the police
Pills and titties, I swear I was in Ibiza
Taking shots now so I know you aim to please

[Verse 2]
She getting checks, I keep the telly
Cancel the membership at Follies
I work her out and give her tips
Do Pilates on the dick
I'm getting dough, I'm getting rolls now
She got some buddies, tell 'em roll out
Money, like clothes is hard to fold now
Back to back, that coca sold out
They not stashing when it's cold now

[Hook]
Under the redlight, you mean, ain't no stopping here?
She told me that's right
You want all of my attention, no at ease
Told me what you want, I get you on your knees
I got so much work overseas they need the visa
My neck, my wrist, looking flashy like the police
Pills and titties, I swear I was in Ibiza
Taking shots now so I know you aim to please
