[Hook: Jeremih]
As the raindrops falling
She starts calling
We just take our time
Every time we get up
Can't forget her
She just blows my mind, oh
Miss Jane, Miss Jane, Miss Jane, Miss Jane
Miss Jane

[Intro: Sir Michael Rocks]
We bad, huh (x4)

[Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
All you gotta do is just call me up and let me know what you wanna do
You say you through with the bullshit, you ain't trynna fool with the same dudes you used to
I'm feelin like you want to get away, but
You wait and debate, you probably wait another day
Aye, don't let the time go to waste babe
You a dime plus eight
And the limelight shining on you
You don't care what they say
They hate and you illuminating while they dim
They just mad that it ain't them
Is it me, is it the weed or my imagination
The roof jumped into the trunk
Told her get in the front, then I asked her to change the station
Other niggas hate, they just mad you taken
But I heard it might rain, maybe we should just stay in

[Hook: Jeremih]

[Intro: Sir Michael Rocks]
So you think you bad (x4)

[Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks]
You lamping, you lounging
Yo ass so astounding
And I'm announcing that I found it
I found ya, surround ya
With everything that I got because
Can't trust the cops gotta watch the fuzz
Can't rush the clock, only stop for love
And we taught to fight everything we don't like
The right thing is just concentrate
Meditate, let's contemplate
You better get a clue, find your place
Where you fit, maybe we split
Maybe we win, and maybe we quit
And we might smoke and we might sip
Get your girl drunk til she might strip
But we take our time so we don't slip

[Hook]
