[Hook: Jeremih]
Let's roll out to Miami and get the money
Baby how that sound?
When I'm feelin' high I'm probably on some light skin
When I’m feelin' low I’m sippin' on some brown
Won’t you come trips to California?
We can get with it, show you how the shit goes down
Know around the world'll get nasty
And I'mma be right there, as long as where it's
That's where the cash be

[Post-Hook: Jeremih]
Cash be
And I'mma be right there, right where my cash be
Yeah yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no
That's where the cash be

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Mula, fetty, you not ready
I'mma get the cheese but the bread was spaghetti
Letti said he can play with them broads
Opportunistic I stay on them hoes
I ain't got time to be hanging with y'all
'Specially when there is no money involved
Joint seem mighty long, red beam on his dome
Point seen, money gone

[Hook: Jeremih]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Robert De Niro, fly as a sparrow
Profit to profit, arrow to pharaoh
El Bueno, hustle like Maino
All money in, no Drano
Can't no-body, get it like I get mines
Smoke papers, Jamaica, I make it, bake it, shake it, or make it
Never had to fake it to make it
Just put the pedal to the metal rock it up to get flakey
I'm living the fast life
Jet after jet and try to keep my cash right
I know you understand the meaning
Hand full of green and while the fans keep fainting
Straight up, no leaning, I'm right where the chips at
Or even in the hood where the crips at
Joint seem mighty long, red beam on his dome
Point seen money gone

[Interlude: Snoop Dogg & Jeremih]
All right now, I need Passion to the stage
I need Destiny, Maliah, Passion
And I'mma be right there, right where my cash be
I need y'all to the stage, let's go
Yeah yeah
I need y'all on the stage, let's go
Work, work, work

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
In a white ghost sipping holy water
Always been the type to get it close to Porter's
After play, Barry Bonds, out the park
I got hits, what you mean? I throw the tarp
At the wall, off the wall, I feel like Mike
I don't miss, niggas talkin' shit
Say I took his bitch, hit that pussy, it took one night
Hitting that hoe quit, it was just aight
Uhh, not at all
I ain't get to see the wall, I cocked 'em all
Fucked it all, fuck the law, fuck you thought
I ain't change, seen my chain looks like the car
Flash man, flashy this and dancing on me
Dirty dancing, dancing like my double cup
Lemonade to niggas that be talking tough
Say you got money, I just double up
Multiply, fuck addition, fuckin bitches all night
Macauley Culkin, rich and riches
This the life, they walk away, it's so delicious
Up in Dubai, sushi, hella bitches
Aw man wrote a check, 2 commas
Please please, tell em' I need two shots by two o' clock
Plus that adds about $2000, two drops
Pull up with my crew sellin out

[Outro: Jeremih]
I need a girl who will do whatever I want
I need a girl who will do whatever I want
