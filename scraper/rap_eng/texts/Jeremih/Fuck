[Intro]
I just wanna fuck-fuck-fuck
I just wanna fuck-fuck-fuck
I just wanna fuck-fuck-fuck
I just wanna fuck

[Chorus: Jeremih & Post Malone]
I ain't here for no conversation
I ain't really tryna talk (yeah) (I just wanna fuck)
Can a nigga be honest, baby? (baby) (I just wanna fuck)
I just came here to fuck (really?)
Shawty, take off them heels and your shirt (I just wanna fuck)
And that skirt and them panties right now (I just wanna fuck)
Baby, step into my room, show me love
And get served like tennis right now
If you wanna come and get served right now
Then you know it's goddamn guaranteed to go down

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I'm going down, you're going down
It's going down for sure
Baby girl, sit down right now
Give you five seconds, one, two, three, four
I'ma turn your ass around, right now
Now you're screaming, "Good Lord"
Got you smoking on the loud, knock you down
Fuck you like you never been before
I could fuck you all the time
Girl, I'm glad you mine

[Chorus: Jeremih & Post Malone]
I ain't here for no conversation
I ain't really tryna talk (yeah) (I just wanna fuck)
Can a nigga be honest, baby? (Baby) (I just wanna fuck)
I just came here to fuck (really?)
Shawty, take off them heels and your shirt (I just wanna fuck)
And that skirt and them panties right now (I just wanna fuck)
Baby, step into my room, show me love
And get served like tennis right now
If you wanna come and get served right now
Then you know it's goddamn guaranteed to go down

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Go down, hell yeah, I'ma say it
Go and show me what you working with
Give a fuck about the man that you rolling with
Think it's 'bout damn time that you done with him
How you get so bad? We all wonderin'
Lil mama look hotter than the summer is
I ain't gon' tell you lies like the other did
Baby girl, I'ma keep it one hundred
Get me on, I'ma, I'ma call you later
And these Saint Laurent's looking alligator
And maybe that's why she want an elevator
Elevate your life, elevate your life and
Girl, you know I wouldn't wanna wife ya
Girl, I wouldn't wanna make you spiteful
Girl, I wouldn't wanna mix your life up
Mix your life up, oh

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Yeah, I was tryna get her to my bed (to my bed)
But we ain't make it out the kitchen (yeah, oh, yeah) (I just wanna fuck)
I was cooking and I burned the bacon (damn) (I just wanna fuck)
Pussy got a nigga slippin' (yeah)
Got your boy going deep: breaststroke, backstroke (I just wanna fuck)
Girl, I'm swimming right now (I just wanna fuck)
Got her singing like me, when she moan
Let's make a song, 'cause we're jamming right now

[Outro: Post Malone]
I could fuck you all the time
Girl, I'm glad you mine, oh
