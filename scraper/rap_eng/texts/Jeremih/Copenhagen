[Intro]
Late night
J'adore tes late nights, Jeremih tu me manques quand tu fais tout Ã§a
XXXXX
Ca me fait quelque chose

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Girl, you know wassup, we ain't talked in a minute
Felt like I'm in love from the first time I seen ya
Know you don't be up, hit you up when I'm lit
You know you the only one that I miss
Baby girl, you the only one that I miss
I don't give a fuck, not a fuck bout no bitches
What I gotta do to show I care for you
You know, you know, you...
You know, you know, you know that I be there for you
There for you, there for you, there for you
There for you, there for you, there for you
There for you, there for you, there for you
There for you, there for you, know that I be there for you

[Verse 1: Sonyae]
Could you be here when I need you here
Say you the truth but you show me lies
All that textin' talkin' "how you feel?"
If you was on there you would make the top
I pull up on you if you had a bad day
Throw that shit back and I call you daddy
Eat me for dinner, I make you breakfast
Do it again, we can call it seconds
Fuck them roses, need 12 kisses
I know I deserve somethin' different
Where is all this time that you had for me?
Swear you only givin' half to me
Say you ready, I don't think you ready
Will you be there for me? Prolly maybe
Though I've been missin' you baby
I just can't wait until the day that
You come
And be (there for me)
Told me he didn't care for me
And you be (here for me)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Girl, you know wassup, we ain't talked in a minute
Felt like I'm in love from the first time I seen ya
Know you don't be up, hit you up when I'm lit
You know you the only one that I miss
Baby girl, you the only one that I miss
I don't give a fuck, not a fuck bout no bitches
What I gotta do to show I care for you
You know, you know, you...
You know, you know, you know that I be there for you
There for you, there for you, there for you
There for you, there for you, there for you
There for you, there for you, there for you
There for you, there for you, know that I be there for you

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
You know I'm from the Chi, you think I'm bullshittin'
Want me love you long time and not for a minute
Let's keep 100 like the south side
Why we always play the rewind
If there was anything wrong
Why it's right when I'm with you
In your water I'm well what you wishin'
You've been my vision whole time, focused
But why it's hard to go hard for this
Don't compare me to your other nigga
Girl, no, I'm not just any nigga
Whether near or farsighted
You'll always have my eyes, your lenses
Player actin' up, get to actin' up
I care to take care of ya
I'll be right there for ya

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Girl, you know wassup, we ain't talked in a minute
Felt like I'm in love from the first time I seen ya
Know you don't be up, hit you up when I'm lit
You know you the only one that I miss
Baby girl, you the only one that I miss
I don't give a fuck, not a fuck bout no bitches
What I gotta do to show I care for you
You know, you know, you...
You know, you know, you know that I be there for you
There for you, there for you, there for you
There for you, there for you, there for you
There for you, there for you, there for you
There for you, there for you, know that I be there for you

[Outro]
