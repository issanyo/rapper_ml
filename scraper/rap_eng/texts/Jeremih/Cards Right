[Intro]
Hitmaka!
Hol' up!
Ohh baby, baby, ohh baby, baby
Ohh baby, baby, ohh ohh ohh

[Verse 1]
Got you waiting outside when you see it's me
Ain't no other thing but a PYT
I'm tryna get you alone in my suite
Ain't nobody gotta know, know bout' me

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep it moving, don't stop
I'ma keep it sipping til the sunrise
Just to remind us what we lonesome
You can have it anytime you want to hold some

[Chorus]
You play your cards right, baby I'll be ready to go (I'm ready to)
You play your cards right, baby I'll be ready to go (yeah)
Now all I need is you all over (now all I need is you all over)
You play your cards right, baby I'll be ready to go

[Verse 2]
Need someone to hold me down as I come up, come up, come up
Later on tonight, play around til the sun up, sun up, sun up

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep it moving, don't stop
I'ma keep it sipping 'til the sunrise
Just to remind us what we lonesome
You can have it anytime you want to hold some

[Chorus]
You play your cards right, baby I'll be ready to go (I'm ready to)
You play your cards right, baby I'll be ready to go (yeah)
Now all I need is you all over (now all I need is you all over)
You play your cards right, baby I'll be ready to go
