[Intro: T.I.]
Ay man
What we put us together, may no man bring it down
Stand up guys are defined as kind
Ay, fuck what you talmbout
What's up with your bitch, nigga?

[Chorus: Jeremih & Young Thug]
Uh, uh oh
You just lost your girl, I just made that my baby (mine, nigga)
Man that bih so bad, I just bought her a 'Cedes (skrt)
She ain't used to that lifestyle yet, that I live (skrt, skrt)
Poppin' bottles late night, wylin', I be trippin' (sheesh, sheesh)
Bet on Vegas Strip, you know I keep my chips (yeah)
Big ol' cups of Hen, we out here gettin' tipsy (yeah, yeah)
I got all my niggas, man she brought some friends (all my niggas)
We gon' make our own damn party up in here (hey)

[Bridge: Young Thug & T.I.]
Up in here (what?)
Lookin' for your bitch, she prolly up in here (yeah, ay)
It ain't no turnin' down, you know we turnin' up in here (turnt, turnt)
Tootsies, I need me a private party up in here(alright)
I just might eat it down up in here (go)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay, she know I'ma give her what she ask for (nigga)
I give a damn 'bout a man, ain't no thing
I'ma put it everywhere, 'cept her asshole
Pockets full of them hunnids and fifties
You can see me when I come to your city
I got nun but some bad bitches with me
Tear it down, just my bag and some ass and titty
I walk up in the club with some care to distribute
Heh, if ya ass get busy
And pimpin' 'n pimpin' is all I know, learnt this shit long ago
Cast her one out, then go get me three stronger hoes
Heh, and as far as the corner goes, I'm solid as the ground that you are standing on
But enough about you, man that bitch standin' next to you ain't got no panties on

[Chorus: Jeremih & Young Thug]
Uh, uh oh
You just lost your girl, I just made that my baby (mine, nigga)
Man that bih so bad, I just bought her a 'Cedes (skrt)
She ain't used to that lifestyle yet, that I live (skrt, skrt)
Poppin' bottles late night, wylin', I be trippin' (sheesh, sheesh)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Fuck a blue Taurus, I hop out a Bentley, hop right in a 'Rari (skrrrt)
Hop on some planes and left L.A. like Horry (bye)
Yessir, I nutted on lil' mama face so she know she can take me tomorrow (ugh, ugh, ugh)
Gator the floor in the 'Rari, no Mauri (ah)
I got a quarter million off of gamblin', another three mill off of tourin' (tell 'em)
Fuck nigga play, I'm goin' Chopper City right off in New Orleans, lil' whoadie
Yeah, I'm shootin' him up, he 'bout to have some cheese on his muhfuckin' head like Wisconsin, (what?) yeah, yeah
Light up his insides just like a pumpkin, lit
Tryna turn nothing to something
Bitch, I'll evolve like a donkey
Bitch, I'm 'bout that money and function
Bitch, I don't know Donald but trunk him (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby, I might think about you like some shit
When I looked at her, she looked a lil' nervous like she did something, my lean spilled like

[Chorus: Jeremih & Young Thug]
Uh, uh oh
You just lost your girl, I just made that my baby (mine, nigga)
Man that bih so bad, I just bought her a 'Cedes (skrt)
She ain't used to that lifestyle yet, that I live (skrt, skrt)
Poppin' bottles late night, wylin', I be trippin' (sheesh, sheesh)

We got plenty bitch (got 'em)
Have our own damn party (woo)
Had a plan, woulda met her (yeah)
Heard her man got fed up (damn)
In the bedroom with her legs up (yup)
If she ain't fuck, it was heads up (what?)
All I know is we could backstab
We up in the Vegas blackjack table like woah (woah)
They say (what?), haters (who?), broke (what?), me (me?)
Stop (stop), I been (what?), on and off the clock (blagh)
