[Chorus: Dreezy]
Yo body on my body, baby
I'm about to catch a body in here, baby
I love the way you grind on me
Said I'm about to catch a body in here, baby
It's going down
I'm about to catch a body
Oh yeah, oh yeah, don't stop it now
I'm about to catch a body

[Verse 1: Dreezy]
Keep it a hunnid, boy I know that you want it
Another round, won't remember in the morning
Got on your shirt, put in that work
Until you clock out
Mike Tyson, boy you know I got that knockout
Take a dive inside this liquor
Got me pulling on your zipper
He wanna hit a lick, I got my legs up like a stick-up
I woke up in my glory
Keep a K with me like Kourtney
Since a shorty I been popping like a forty
End of story baby

[Chorus : Jeremih & Dreezy]
Yo body on my body, baby
I'm about to catch a body in here, baby
I love the way you grind on me
Said I'm about to catch a body in here, baby
Oh yeah, oh yeah, It's going down
I'm about to catch a body
Oh yeah, oh yeah, don't stop it now
I'm about to catch a body

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
You work that thang like a nine to five
Clock in to work and put in overtime
I pull up on you with that thang through your back
And beat it up like ra-ta-ta-ta-tat (lock and load it)
Got a Uzi on your booty know you popping
Clip after clip ain't got no problem with me watching
Time on our side
We got all night
Fuck that tick tocking
Smith and Wesson 'bout to teach yo ass a lesson
Start undressing

[Verse 3: Dreezy]
Ain't going home baby we could go all night (yeah)
Drop all yo hoes, let me show you I'mma rider
Make the neighbors call the cops
Still ain't finna stop
I see these bitches tryna block
Take another shot
Bang Bang, you look good boy
You could be my main thing
Rich sex, I saw your chain slang, I'm on the same thing
Might give in if you don't let up
Im just tryna fuck your bed up
Talking shit gon' get you hit
Boy, don't get wet up, it's a set up
Baby

[Chorus: Jeremih & Dreezy]
Yo body on my body, baby
I'm about to catch a body in here, baby
I love the way you grind on me
Said I'm about to catch a body in here, baby
Oh yeah, oh yeah, It's going down
I'm about to catch a body
Oh yeah oh yeah, don't stop it now
I'm about to catch a body

[Verse 4 : Jeremih]
You me and me on you baby
So tell me what you wanna do baby
Said everything is up to you baby
So it's up to you
This could be your best night
Get you home for the night
And do you just right

[Chorus: Jeremih & Dreezy]
Yo body on my body, baby

This could be your best night

And do you just right (I'm about to catch a body in here, baby)
This could be your best night
Get you home for the night
And do you just right (I'm about to catch a body in here, baby)
