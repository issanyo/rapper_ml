[Verse 1]
Damn she so fine, yeah, yeah
Someone tell her she's all mines, yeah, mines
Playing for keeps, she bob on the beat
I tell her, "No teeth," catch it before it get all on sheets
Hundreds, fiftys, throw each
Deep, deep, she deep, Z-Z-Z, she suck me to sleep
Damn, thought she was a good girl, never knew she had it in her
Thought she was a good girl, never knew she had it in her
All I know is that when I woke up, she was wasn't there
All I know is she was wasn't there

[Chorus]
She must've sucked me to sleep
Bad bitch suck me to sleep
Savage, suck me to sleep
Ain't nobody ever suck me to sleep
Ain't nobody never, suck me to sleep
And it was the slowest, suck me to sleep
Lips was the coldest, suck me to sleep
Had to make a song how she suck me to sleep

[Verse 2]
Tell me why you got me thinkin' 'bout your sister
Now you came over and fucked my head up
Thought I was dreamin' and I never wanted to wake up
Damn, thought she was a good girl, never knew she had it in her
Thought she was a good girl, never knew she had it in her
All I know is that when I woke up, she was wasn't there
All I know is she was wasn't there

[Chorus]
She must've sucked me to sleep
Bad bitch suck me to sleep
Savage, suck me to sleep
Ain't nobody ever suck me to sleep
Ain't nobody never, suck me to sleep
And it was the slowest, suck me to sleep
Lips was the coldest, suck me to sleep
Had to make a song how you suck me to sleep

[Outro]
Damn she so fine, yeah, yeah
Someone tell her she's all mines, yeah, mines
