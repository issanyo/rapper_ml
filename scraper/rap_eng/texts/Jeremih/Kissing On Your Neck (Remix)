[Hook]
I be kissing on your neck, kissing on your neck
Know it got you upset but trust I can fix it
I’m touchin’ on your body, I'mma get you started
I’ve been kissing on your neck, kissing on your neck

[Verse 1]
Fuck what you thought was the remix
If your man fuckin' up you should play this
Pick up your phone, hit me up on the low
I ain't the one to play games with
She a freak, in the streets she a lady
I dressin' you up in the latest
I pick you up in that new 'Cedes
I ride for you cause you my baby
And she don't have to question
If you wanna go home, I ain't stressin', no pressure
No clothes, no phones
Lights out, I'mma turn you on
I'mma break you off, then I'm gone


[Hook]
I be kissing on your neck, kissing on your neck
Know it got you upset but trust I can fix it
I’m touchin’ on your body, I'mma get you started
I’ve been kissing on your neck, kissing on your neck

[Verse 2]
You know I'mma take it slow for ya, quickie
They say just take your pick but I'm picky
You should know, you should hear me
Is you a available? Girl it's easy
You know that pussy worth bout a ticket
I can't even front, I go crazy
Every time you sing, your boy here afflicted
That pussy gettin' impatient
Your body be havin' conversation
You keep that ass in rotation
Might take your ass to crustaceans
Seen that ass from the side
I see it, don't move them shits to the side
I want that all head to mine
Can't help that I know that (?)

[Hook]
I be kissing on your neck, kissing on your neck
I know it got you upset but trust I can fix it
I’m touchin’ on your body

[Verse 3]
Girl don't mean to interrupt but you made me
Your body talkin', it say, come here baby
Up in Barney, I ain't talkin' Macy's
Just let me swim up in it like the Navy
I'm finna run it just like some Asics
One in a million baby, you ain't basic
All the shots got a nigga wasted
Choke off your love every time I taste it
Choke off your love every time I taste it
Girl you know how

[Hook]
I be kissing on your neck, kissing on your neck
Know it got you upset but trust I can fix it
I’m touchin’ on your body, I'mma get you started
I’ve been kissing on your neck, kissing on your neck

[Outro]
You know I love to put my lips on you
(I know baby)
You like foreplay? I like it too
You know I love to put my lips on you
