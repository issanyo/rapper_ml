[Verse: Jeremih]
I say you gotta have it
You know I gotta grab it
Girl, my hands on you now
Stay calm, I had it (? might be wrong)
And we took a look at it
Your body like a weapon, automatic
Girl, eyes on you now
Stay calm, I have it (? might be wrong)
She fresher than recipes
When she walk rest in piece
I can see (?)
(?) she next to me
She whipped the whip (?)
Specially when she talk sexually
(?) for me
(?)
(?)
I'm done with that (?)
...

Confident
Oh is it down there
Right there

Crazy
Turning your confidence to crazy
Ohoh baby
The way you lay down (down)
They gon' call you (?)
Oh yeah confident (?)
They (?)
Baby they can (?) confident
(?) nothing girl (?) baby
Maybe cause it is you're confident
