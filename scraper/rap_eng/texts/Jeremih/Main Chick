[Intro: Chris Brown]
I told her "Fuck that nigga"
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't know your name, but you've heard my name
I know why you came, tryna get that name
But you heard my name
Girl I know you wanna be my main chick
My main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with, I told her "Fuck that nigga"
(I don't know ya)

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
We sitting in the back of the club, table got a rope in the front, I don't know ya
You looking real familiar, I could just be a lil drunk
I don't know your name, it's a God damn shame
I don't know how to explain it for ya
But, girl, I'm just saying if you got a man back home
I don't know him
What, just keep it on the hush, pocket full of trees, don't beat around the bush
Walk on green, I can even hear the putt, K.O shawty when I hit her with a punchline
Get a couple shots when it's crunch time, ducking from my ex like a one time
Throw a sign when you really tryna go, got the car parked right at the door

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't know your name, but you've heard my name
I know why you came, tryna get that name
But you heard my name
Girl I know you wanna be my main chick, my main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with, I told her "Fuck that nigga" (I don't know ya)

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Nah, and you don't know my name, no, just in case you the feds, I don't know ya
I might'a poured you a drink, but don't let it go to your head
I know why you came, tryna be my main chick
Passenger side when I lane switch, top back, two seats only, ain't no room for your friends, I don't know them
We just seizing the moment, up all night, throw a deuce to the morning
Fly motherfucker, everything is imported, don't try to act too important, I know your game
You got a gang of niggas, all over you, but you all over here, on me
Girl, I ain't tryna dog ya, bad bitch only thing I'll call you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't know your name, but you've heard my name
I know why you came, tryna get that name
But you heard my name
Girl I know you wanna be my main chick, my main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with, I told her "Fuck that nigga"

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Baby, why you playing? You heard my name
(Let me see that curvy body) I know why you came
She gon' gimme that brain so we can do our thang, let's do that thang
So what you think'bout me taking you down, yeah?
I can be your man when he's not around, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't know your name, but you've heard my name
I know why you came, tryna get that name
But you heard my name
Girl I know you wanna be my main chick, my main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with, I told her "Fuck that nigga"
(I don't know ya)
