Bring it

Her hips waving the ocean
In ways you wouldn't believe
She swear that she got that potion
Well I hope there's plenty for me
Cause I been searching for somebody to cater, to cater
Cater to all my needs
And you look like your willing to do the favor, the favor

So come with me and let me work that body
Body, body, body AH-OO
You know just how I like it naughty
Naughty, naughty, naughty. Doo-Doo Doo-Doo
Yeah we got plenty of Bacardi
Bacardi, Bacardi, Bacardi and juice and fruit for you
A private at the party
Party, party , party for two
For two

You can get my body
My body all over your body baby
Your body all over my body
You can get my body
My body all over your body baby
All over my body girl

I'm feeling like I should tip ya
The way your grinding the pole
Your hot and fresh out the kitchen
Here's a taste of that pot of gold

And make me feel like I'm a go on vacation
Cooler than summer breezes
Girl get your groove back
Better than in Jamaica

Hope you don't mind if I am behind
Body, body, body, body AH-OO
You know just how I like it naughty
Naughty, naughty, naughty. Doo-Doo Doo-Doo
Yeah we got plenty of Bacardi
Bacardi, Bacardi, Bacardi and juice and fruit for you
A private at the party
Party, party , party for two
For two

You can get my body
My body all over your body baby
Your body all over my body
You can get my body
My body all over your body baby
All over my body girl

I love it when you roll
And still manage to clasp that
Clasp that ass, clasp that
Just keep the candles on
And baby I can wax that, wax that ass, wax that

Body, body, body, body AH-OO
You know just how I like it naughty
Naughty, naughty, naughty. Doo-Doo Doo-Doo
Yeah we got plenty of Bacardi
Bacardi, Bacardi, Bacardi and juice and fruit for you
A private at the party
Party, party , party for two
For two

You can get my body
My body all over your body baby
Your body all over my body
You can get my body
My body all over your body baby
All over my body girl
