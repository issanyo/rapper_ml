[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Bout to send this bitch up
Bout to send this bitch up
Aye, but

[Chorus]
Get down little mama, get down little mama
Get down little mama, get down little mama
You gon' do for him, do it for me?
Would you do it for me? (Would you do it for me?)
Would you do it for me? (Would you do it for me?)
Go 'head get down little mama
Get down little mama, get down little mama
Get down little mama
If you don't do it for him
Would you do it for me? (Would you do it for me?)
Would you do it for me? (Would you do it for me?)
Would you do it for me?

[Verse 1]
Whole club popped out
Section full of freaks
Don't take off your shirt
Know you sweat hard
Baby, baby let me see
Booty on squeeze
Titties on D's
Ain't a nigga tweak
Aye

[Chorus]
Get down little mama, get down little mama
Get down little mama
If you gon' do it for him, would you do it for me?
You better do it for him, you better do it for me

[Verse 2]
I told her bring her friends
Get 'em tipsy, X'll make 'em go hard
Let me knock it out the ball park
Bentley big enough for all y'all
Coach your squad and now they all stars
Aye, so

[Chorus]
Get down little mama, get down little mama
If you gon' do it for him, better do it for me
(Better do it for me)
If you gon' do it for him, better do it for me
(Better do it for me)
Aye, get down little mama, get down little mama
Get down little mama, get down little mama
Know I'm lookin' for a freak
If you gon' do it for him, better do it for me
(Better do it for me) better do it for me
(Better do it for me)
Go ahead, get down little mama, get down little mama
Get down little mama, get down little mama

[Bridge]

[Outro]
Make it swang, like a chain
Make it swang, like a chain
Then let me (clap somethin')
Then let me (clap somethin')
Then let me (clap somethin')
Then let me (clap somethin')
Make it roll, booty swole
Up and down, up the fold
Touch your toes, touch your toes
Up and down, hit the floor
Let me bang, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
Make it swang, like a chain
Make it swang, like a chain
