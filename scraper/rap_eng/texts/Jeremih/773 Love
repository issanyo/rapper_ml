[Verse 1]
Let me be your stimulation
I could be your occupation
Work you like a 9 to 5
Plus put in that over time
Careful with what you do to me
Cause everything I do to you
I hope that you'll do for me
And when the light's low
Pop a bottle of that goose please
Twist off a couple loose leaves
(Seduce me)
Girl welcome to my bed
Come here
You thought it would be easy (sy-sy-sy)

[Hook]
(Ow)
Sexy I should get to know
Been thinking lately girl we can get more physical
Won't you call 773, 779 love, oh
Those pantie drawers is all I need
Falling off of your body
Won't you call 773, 779 love, oh

[Verse 2]
Better now and even later
Let me be your innovator
Feels alright when I'm right with you
They lyin' if you not the truth
Miss co-star, let's proceed
You got that fire, that third degree
Yo, this is how's supposed to be
And when the light's low
Pop bottle with a goose please
Twist off a couple loose sleeves
(Seduce me)
And welcome to my bed
Baby won't you come here
Thought it would be easy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Okay girl I'm not him put it down, down
Okay girl I'm not him put it down, down
Okay girl I'm not him put it down, down
Cause I know in you's a little freak let it out, out

[Hook]
