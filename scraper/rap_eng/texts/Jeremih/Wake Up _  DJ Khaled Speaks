[Intro]
Yo, turn my music up
Up some more, up some more
Up a little more

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
I know it's really been a long night
I know we could have made it on [?]
You know I really know what's going down
Been a while, it's been a while
Tonight we don't need none of your friends
Just Patron and you, I'm in
It's like you really fell asleep
Now it's time we're doing it again
Now it's time we're doing it again
Said we started something that will never end
I was in my zone MJ
Remember when he star 69
Positions change through the time
Candles burn out the lights
Ain't done with you but that nigga done
Touching on her, waking her way to love

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Loving how you look when you lay there for me
Finish what we started, damn you sexy when you naked

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
I got something for ya baby
Turn up one more, baby ain't gonna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up

[Bridge]
She my very best lover
Love me like no other
Her behind the cover
Don't you tell another
She my very best lover
Without a rubber
Yeah she give me that [?]
She don't want another

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Outro]
Momma always told me to be careful in love
And daddy told me "make sure you love them right"
I always had my eyes on this one particular girl
She say she never found a nigga that (made, made, made)
