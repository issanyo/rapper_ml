And we’re about to start crying
Pick up your phone, baby, just call me

Anything to get between us, babe
Wish somebody would’ve seen us, babe
Who knew that you could teach me something new?

[Outro: Jeremih]
Okay, I’m in love… keep turning up
It’s your turn… I’m in love, I’m in love…
Say you do, don’t say nothing
Wish somebody would’ve seen us, babe
A lot of strippers changed, somebody should’ve touched
I love it when you love me, baby
I love it when you love me, baby
When you stroke me, take me right
You know I love that…
When you’re riding with me…
When you’re riding with me…
When you’re riding with me…
I need a lil’ Bo Peep… (let me see it, girl)
I need a lil’ Bo Peep…
I’m down with them freaks…
