[Verse 1: Nico]
Tell me what you feel what you think about when you see me
But if you wanna show i love to find out this evening
I know you been through some very rough times
Now you think you know what every mans like ?
I promise i will never treat you like he did
Yeah I’m young but I’m grown
Let me be the one you call
I swear to God the way you grind gon' keep me home
Wine like ya from an island
Loving your position and timing
Princess i wanna make you mine
So lemme know if I’m waisting time

[Hook: Velous]

You’re A The League Of Your Own

[Verse 2: French Montana]
