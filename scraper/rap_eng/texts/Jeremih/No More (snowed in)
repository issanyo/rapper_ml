[Intro]
Yea, Shlohmo
Eh let me low
Oh yea
Yea, turn it up

[Pre-Hook]
Well
Emotions known to take away your buzz
I know your name
Tell me what youâ€™re really waiting for

[Hook]
I know you know
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait no more
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait no more
No more
The way you live it up and let me rub you down, oh
I won't let it out until you let me know if you love it

[Verse 2]
Just admit that you got it baby
Ain't you ready to go?
And you wit it you know it lady
Tell me baby I know
Tell me reason she still here waitin'
And you've felt this before
All I want is you now and later
Go wherever I go
Go whatever I do
Go wherever I go
Go whatever, you know

[Hook]

[BOOTS: Verse 3]
Are the sights aligned?
Did I aim too high?
Are the stars aligned?
Do I get too high?
Does the water still flow up to your knees
Pom-poms in your hand you could be my main squeeze
I might lie to the stans
I might fly to Japan
I just lost translation, speaking Japanese
Snakes
Crawling up my legs
Space
I keep falling off the ledge
Checks won't cash for my dead-broke ass
I don't got a dime yet, 20 million on blast
I don't rest no more
Don't get stressed no more
You gotta wrap it up every single time
So a mother fucker gotta get a test no more
Skip to your lou my lou
Got nobody that I know, no crew
Got no money that I owe, old news
People act funny when I sing the blues
Your pussy taste like apple juice
Baby that's a juice box
Baby you're a stone fox
Or maybe you're a gold watch
But I rust around the dust you clarify
Shaking in your bones you're terrified
Taking off your clothes how low can we go
Limbo through the door lemme verify
She could never love me like the way that I could love her
Cuz there'll never be another like me never be another
Leave me trust me lust me hush me turn your mind off fuck you, fuck me
It's getting cold tonight
The snow falls out of tune
Sorry shit gets ugly
Things get gnarly
Trapped at all these parties
I'm in disguise
You're in denial
But I'm still on trial
You're on my mind
No more
