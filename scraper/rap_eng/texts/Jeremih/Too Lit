[Hook: Jeremih]
Hey, hey I know it's
Get them dollars [?]
All your exes they ain't know you didn't love you no
Sippin' shots from the gallon take a timezone yeah
Vibes on good, we would just burn summer
And them big bodies so precious
Let your body talk no Lexus
Past 2 am and it's too lit
Damn I just hope it ain't too late

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Woah, for me to be textin'
You know I got a couple questions
What you doing baby girl? And what you dressed in?
And do I need the directions?
You know when I go up I'm more than X
Just flexing, finessing, it's part of the profession
We in the right place girl you 'posed to be here
So don't take it to emotionally when
These hoes tryna say that I don't miss you
The blogs tryna say we ain't official
But I'm already knowing the potential
And what they talking 'bout don't mean nothing when I'm with you babe

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
You know when I'm with you
Better off with us two
You know your heart, I can't lose
Don't know what I would do

[Hook: Jeremih]

Damn I just hope it ain't too late

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Damn I'm just hoping you ain't thinking
What I'm sayin' is only cause I'm drinking
How I'm actin' is only cause your dress tight
You wearing less and that's a test ride
Girl I bend you over the desk and teach
Hit your report card with the D
Depth stroke brush stroke in the deep end
And change clothes, getting dressed up in Neimans
I love how that fit you and I don't need a ref to tell me that we official
You know I can tell when it's issue
Say you need a shot, I've been trying to assist boo

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
You know when I'm with you
Better off with us two
You know your heart, I can't lose
Don't know what I would do

[Outro: Jeremih]
You know when I'm with you
Better off with us two
You know your heart, I can't lose
Don't know what I would do
