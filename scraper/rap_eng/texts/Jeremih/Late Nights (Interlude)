Late night, just another show
Live but you showin' me the under clause
Maybe you twitter like your intuitor
Intuitor, intuitor (toast to)
Late nights with a much of chicks
They ain't gonna think I'll need another sip
Shorty knew it's nothing cuz you pull it up
You pull it up, you pull it up (toast to)
Late nights, spin a couple alts
In this here, fresh gear, just another love
This right here is an open toast to overlord and overdose
Late nights late nights
Late nights late nights
Late nights
Say you got the shit to make him wanna do
Tell me baby, how you have fondue
This isn't how you plan to do real good night
Imma do what you did, sensationalize
And our life when the sky's dark blue
Took the fame by the bubble, over one time soon
Said why don't you grab the twitter, tell the shit we wanna do
Cuz I'm the bad extert where the dreams come true
Will you come and ride with me? fly chief
If I were the nigga startin' stratchin' up on it
Take you down town shoppin', case of her lv, g fly with her
I just wanna, I just wanna stick her pussy, pop it so drama
Hair so smart, booty so dumb
Oh shit, think to the one, think through the night, sing to the night (toast to)
Late night, just another show
Live but you showin' me the under clause
Maybe you twitter like your intuitor
Intuitor, intuitor (toast to)
Late nights with a much of chicks
They ain't gonna think I'll need another sip
Shorty knew it's nothing cuz you pull it up
You pull it up, you pull it up (toast to)
Late nights, spin a couple alts
In this here, fresh gear, just another love
This right here is an open toast to overlord and overdose
Late nights late nights
Late nights late nights
Late nights
I said I'm hood and fresh as el lemar
I look up in the mirror like 'what's up dog?'
Think tonight is gonna be (a good night)
Tell the front desk I'm gonna need a (wake-up call)
Down and pressurize like (wait wait)
You know a nigga startin' to get (what up dog?)
People always askin' me why i(skate skate)
I tell them shot town, my town (what up dog?)
Man, I'm takin' them down like eleven below
You hear them now like you've never before
They're runnin' the town, give me the clown
Cuz either the world or the piff in the blow
Rock with your girls when you go to the mall
Rubbin' the pearls when you go to my show
In and out, just one way to go
If already know then you already (toast to the nights)
Late night, just another show
Live but you showin' me the under clause
Maybe you twitter like your intuitor
Intuitor, intuitor (toast to)
Late nights with a much of chicks
