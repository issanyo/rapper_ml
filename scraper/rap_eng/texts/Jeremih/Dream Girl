[Intro: Christopher Williams sample]
Don't wake me, I’m dreaming

[Verse 1: Nick Cannon]
Tell the bitch now I don't wanna get up
Ain't over my ex yet, never
Still think about her everytime I get her
Paparazzi always asks me why I left her
That's none of your motherfuckin' business
These niggas out here can’t help us
Undercover dream lovers, that been us
Got me smokin' them fumes at Jenna's
Had to tell that young, bitch, shut up
'Cause I'm still thinkin' 'bout Keisha
And she still trippin' off Tina
And I'm tryna turn up in Ibiza
And I ain’t wanna leave for a Lisa
But you gave me so many fuckin' reasons
Got the whole world thinkin' I'm a cheater
Got the whole world thinkin' I'm a cheater

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Oh, woah, I still dream about you, baby
(I still dream about you, baby)
And it's something how you hate me
(and it's something how you hate me)
Pretending I don’t give a fuck lately
(pretending I don't give a fuck)
Who you sleeping on if it ain’t me? (woo)
You're my dream girl (woo)
Don’t wake me up
Don’t wake me, don’t you wake me up
My dream girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Ty Money, (Jeremih) & Quavo]
Aww
Don’t you (don’t you)
Don’t you (don’t you)
Wake me (wake me)
Up (up)
No sleep
No-no sleep
Not at all
Don’t you (don’t you)
Don’t you (don’t you)
Wake me (wake me)
Up (up)
No sleep
No-no sleep
Wake me up

[Verse 2: Ty Money & Nick Cannon]
I don’t know what you scared of (scared of)
You know I make it mo' better (better)
The blues you got me singin' bye bye (bye)
And my dreams are gettin' wetter (wetter)
Cryin' at night in our bedroom (I'm cryin', I'm cryin')
But we used to do it together (we used to do it together)
Bangin' and bangin' them headboards (bangin' them, bangin' them)
And your head was better than Jessica (Jessica)
Had to tell that Young, bitch, shut up (shut up)
'Cause I'm still thinkin' 'bout Keisha
And she still trippin' off Tina
And I’m tryna turn up in Ibiza
And I ain’t wanna leave for a Lisa
But you gave me so many fucking reasons
Got the whole world thinking I'm a cheater
Got the whole world thinking I'm a cheater

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Oh, woah, I still dream about you, baby
(I still dream about you, baby)
And it's something how you hate me
(and it's something how you hate me)
Pretending I don’t give a fuck lately
(pretending I don't give a fuck)
Who you sleeping on if it ain’t me? (woo)
You're my dream girl (woo)
Don’t wake me up
Don’t wake me, don’t you wake me up
My dream girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Ty Money, (Jeremih) & Quavo]
Don’t you (don’t you)
Don’t you (don’t you)
Wake me (wake me)
Up (up)
No sleep
No-no sleep
Not at all
Don’t you (don’t you)
Don’t you (don’t you)
Wake me (wake me)
Up (up)
No sleep
No-no sleep
Wake me up

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Do you find time for me?
Put that on the line for me?
Do you smoke broccoli?
Would you really put your heart in me? (Yeah)
Would you really do your job with me?
She can’t sleep another night lonely (no-no sleep)
She said, "Hold your arms real tight around me" (so tight)
I said, “Fuck what you ever heard about me” ('bout me)
Just take your clothes off now and get in those sheets
I'ma give your ass a wet dream
