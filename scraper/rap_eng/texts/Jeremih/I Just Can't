[Intro]
(I just can’t)

[Verse 1]
I see the blurry, blurry, blurry visions
(I just can’t)
I know it’s tempting, tempting, tempting..
(I just can’t)
With her it seems December 25th err'day
(I just can’t)
Damn, she gifted, gifted, gifted..
I see the blurry, blurry, blurry visions
(I just can’t)
I know it’s tempting, tempting, tempting..
(I just can’t)
With her it seems December 25th err'day
(I just can’t)
Damn, she gifted, gifted, gifted..

[Hook]
I just can’t help when I see her from behind
Ms. P.Y.T. be stuck on my mind
Oh, I bet that fat ass probably ain’t good for my health
And I want that right here for myself
Right na, na, na, na, na
Right na, na, na, na, na
Right na, na, na, na, na
Right na, na, na, na, na
(I just can’t)

[Verse 2]
I ain’t one to clean up dirty, dirty dishes
(Naw)
But I can fix you, fix you
The way you rock and roll your hips
And get to switchin' err'way
It’s my addiction

[Hook]
I just can’t help when I see her from behind
Ms. P.Y.T. be stuck on my mind
Oh, I bet that fat ass probably ain’t good for my health
And I want that right here for myself
Right na, na, na, na, na
Right na, na, na, na, na
Right na, na, na, na, na
Right na, na, na, na, na
(I just can’t)
