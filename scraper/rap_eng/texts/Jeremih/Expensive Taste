[Intro]
Yeah

[Hook: Jeremih]
She say her man a goofy
And now she wanna do me
I'm all about the commas
And you know what I'm talkin' bout
She love the way I'm dancin'
She checkin' out my fashion
Double shots of the Hen tho
She runnin' round in my mansion
Watch out for these gold diggers
That's what my momma told me
Family is closer than friends, I learned that from my OG
These girls can't pull me down cause I'm always gon' eat
Got lobster on my plate, got oysters in my Rollie

[Verse 1: Lil Ceno]
She diggin' my Giuseppe, she love my pelle
My belt my head is Louie, attractin' groupies
These thots can't pull me down, no
Those pants got pounds of dope
OG what I'm smokin', yeah I'm a smoker
She say "why do you do drugs?", I hate bein' sober
I heard your man a broke nigga baby
You need a dope nigga
The mob turnin' up, our Remy burnin' up
If one blue hundreds up
My jewelry glowin' up
I got steak up on my plate
Lobster on some dates
My house look like the taste
I eat with my AK
These boys tryna take me down
Cause I'm the king of town
My pants saggin' now
Cause racks off in 'em now

[Hook: Jeremih]
She say her man a goofy
And now she wanna do me

She runnin' round in my mansion
Watch out for these gold diggers
That's what my momma told me
Family is closer than friends, I learned that from my OG
These girls can't pull me down cause I'm always gon' eat
Got lobster on my plate, got oysters in my Rollie

[Verse 2: Lil Trav]
She askin' why you pop and flex
I told a thot "just give me neck"
My diamonds started switchin' up
It's like they're from a different set
Molly's so amazing, purple in my double cup
I'm switchin' lanes crazy, police steady chasin' us
Rockin' in my Gucci, Louie, Fendi, and my Prada too
Catch us in a Beamer wylin' out like monkeys in a zoo
Got a couple foreign horses out in my garage or two
Niggas smokin' reggie, thought they stopped that shit in '92
Catch me rollin' off a flat, I just might pop a deuce
Pullin' off and peelin' up, I had to stunt on you
Take your wifey and spoil her just to stunt on you
And yeah, you know I recorded just to show the proof

[Hook: Jeremih]
She say her man a groupie
