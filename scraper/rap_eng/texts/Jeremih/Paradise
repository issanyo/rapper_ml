[Verse 1]
Woke up at home off that molly
Bad bitch red bone on my body
Smelling like Patron in mi casa
That was one hell of a party
Wake n bake, then I'm right in it
Don't ask in the morning, I just hit it
Then she gon' skate like she Tony Hawk
And man I'm right back on my sinning

[Chorus]
Oh I knew life would be alright
But who could've known it'd be this good?
Oh and they tell me
It gets better, better, better, better
This is more than life
This is paradise

[Verse 2]
Two Tylenols in a smoothie
Work out and maybe jacuzzi
Thirteen new texts, man they jockin'
That's just more checks in my pocket
My daily been all about that money
Mama ain't ever raise no dummy
Straight out the city where the wind blows
So this one right here for my kinfolk

[Chorus]
Man I knew life would be alright
But who could've known it'd be this good?
Oh and they tell me
It gets better, better, better, better
This is more than life
This is paradise

[Bridge]
So, so, so fuckin' wasted
So, so, so fuckin' high
It's amazing that we made it
We gon' take this past the sky

[Verse 1]
Woke up at home off that molly
Bad bitch red bone on my body
Smelling like Patron in mi casa
That was one hell of a party

[Chorus]
Oh I knew life would be alright
But who could've known it'd be this good?
Oh and they tellin' me
They say it gets better, better, better, better
This is more than life
This is paradise
