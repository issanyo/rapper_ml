Late night, just another show
Bad bitches showin me the under clothes
They Be On twitter like yo you Tore it up, you Tore it up,you Tore it up (toast to)
Late nights with them other chicks
Screamin' that they gon' need another sip
Shorty know it's nothin' cuz we pour it up
We pour it up, We pour it up (toast to)
Late nights, spend a couple O's
This here, fresh gear, just another love
This right here is an open toast to overload and overdose
Late nights late nights
Late nights late nights
Late nights

Say you got the shit to make him wanna do
Tell me baby, have you had fondue
This isn't how you plan to do real good night
I'mma do what you did, times 2
The night life when the sky's dark blue
Champagne bottle poppin' over Wonton soup
Said why donâ€™t you grab your twin, tell her she can come too
Cuz I'm the bed expert where the dreams come true
Won't you come and ride with a nigga? fly chief
If I were the nigga startin' stratchin' up on it
Take you down town shoppin', his and her lv, g fly with her
I just wanna, I just wanna see her pussy, pop it so drama
Hair so smart, booty so dumb
Oh shit, I think you the one, creep through the night, sleep through the sun (toast to)

Late night, just another show
Bad bitches showin me the under clothes
They be on Twitter like 'yo you tore it up'
You tore it up, you tore it up (toast to)
Late nights with them other chicks
Screamin' that they gon' need another sip
Shorty know it's nothin' cuz we pour it up
We pour it up, We pour it up (toast to)
Late nights, spend a couple O's
This here, fresh gear, just another love
This right here is an open toast to overload and overdose
Late nights late nights
Late nights late nights
Late nights

I said now who the freshest of them all
I look up in the mirror like 'what's up dog?'
Thinkin' that it's gonna be (a late night)
Tell the front desk I'm gonna need a (wake-up call)
Down and pressurize like (wait wait)
You know a nigga startin' to get (cut up dog?)
People always askin' me why I (stay stay)
I tell them Chi-town, my town (what up dog?)
Man, I'm takin' them down like eleven below
You hear them now like you've never before
They're runnin' the town, give me the crown
Cuz either the world or the piff in the blow
Rock with your girls when you go to the mall
Rubbin' the pearls when you go to my show
In and out, just one way to go
If already know then you already (toast to the nights)

Late night, just another show
Bad bitches showin me the under clothes
They be on twitter like you tore it up, you tore it up, you tore it up (toast to)
Late nights with them other chicks
Screamin' that they gon' need another sip
Shorty know it's nothin' cuz we pour it up
We pour it up, We pour it up (toast to)

This here, fresh gear, just another love

Late nights late nights
