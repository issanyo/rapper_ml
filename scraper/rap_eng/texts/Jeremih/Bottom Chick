[Chorus: Jeremih]
All she want to do is go shoppin'
Anything she want, I got her
We came a long way from the bottom
Now money ain't a problem with my bottom chick
Stay with my bottom
Stay down with my bottom chick
Keep it real with my bottom, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Derez De'Shon]
Chanel, Gucci, Prada, Dolce Gabanna
Heels with red bottoms whenever she shoppin'
Dressed like a martyr, earrings and watches
Slap on the floor with a nigga, no problem
House to house, she pulled up whenever I called her
Then we moved in the basement at her mama's
Ran up a check and went got us a 'partment
Now we in the mansion tip-toeing on marble
Hey, hey, hey, we a team, play your part
Yeah, sleepin' next to the stars
Half a million dollar cars (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
I swear you can have it all

[Chorus: Jeremih]
All she want to do is go shoppin'
Anything she want, I got her
We came a long way from the bottom
Now money ain't a problem with my bottom chick
Stay with my bottom
Stay down with my bottom chick
Keep it real with my bottom, yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Derez De'Shon]
I got a bitch and she know that
But shawty get the picture like Kodak
Been here since day one, I'm talkin' throwback
Daydreamin', wishin' I can go back
Where shawty said she love me and she show that
That's why every time I get a bag we gon' blow that
I buy a bag, tell her hold that
The least I could do 'cause I owe that
Shawty stayed down like a floormat
Shawty got a key to everywhere a nigga door at
Know all the stash spots and everywhere I keep the dope at
Twelve asking questions and all she say is she don't know nothin'
I held her down, she on the rise just like a culprit

[Chorus: Jeremih]
All she want to do is go shoppin'
Anything she want, I got her
We came a long way from the bottom
Now money ain't a problem with my bottom chick
Stay with my bottom
Stay down with my bottom chick
Keep it real with my bottom, yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
Ain't no roaches but the ones in that ash tray, yeah
I'm throwin' ones when that ass tray, yeah
I know I'm wrong, that's my bad bae, ayy
You been the one everlasting, no no
You was the one since the beginning
I was losing, now a nigga up winning
I was Jordan, you was Pippen
And we rocked the same ring, championship-ing, yeah
We a team, play your part, sleepin' next to the stars
Half a million dollar cars, baby you can have it all

[Chorus: Jeremih]
All she want to do is go shoppin'
Anything she want, I got her
We came a long way from the bottom
Now money ain't a problem with my bottom chick
Stay with my bottom
Stay down with my bottom chick
Keep it real with my bottom, yeah yeah
