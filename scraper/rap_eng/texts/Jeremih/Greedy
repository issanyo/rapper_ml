[Hook: Jeremih]
I don't wanna get greedy
She only calls when she needy
Got bands in the duffle
I count paper, don't read it
Call me Mister Big Shot
I hit then won't stop
Doing big, can't stop
She only calls when she needy

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Let me pick and roll, say you want the play play
Want a fix huh? Slide in your playground
All she know is big business, all I know is gettin' in it
I walk through some doors, just bought the coupe, no ceilings
Nah, I ain't tryna just spend it, but fucked around and threw rain here
All I know is we runnin', Forrest Gump into the money
Told her, "It's bedtime" wrist on wristwatch
She said, "Daddy don't stop" leave the band on my spot
Nope, they talkin' in the street, some are chasin' that Summer breeze
Face on a wall like Mona Lisa, clap that ass, don't need no audience
So cold, leave the Summer [?], hope you ain't on no teasin' teasin'
So fine you ain't gotta sneak her, kick a little then we get to sneakin'

[Hook: Jeremih]
I don't wanna get greedy
She only calls when she needy
Got bands in the duffle
I count paper, don't read it
Call me Mister Big Shot
I hit then won't stop
Doing big, can't stop
She only calls when she needy
I don't wanna get greedy
She only calls when she needy
Got bands in the duffle
I count paper, don't read it
Call me Mister Big Shot
I hit then won't stop
Doing big, can't stop
She only calls when she needy

[Verse 2: Rich the Kid]
She be callin', she fiendin', four in the mornin', she need it
You a fool when you eat it, my flex on her for no reason
I'm in Paris, she freakin', neck cold, wrist freezin'
Waterslide, she leakin', straight to fuckin', ain't speakin'
From the bottom, got this shit out the street, I was hustlin', made a mili a week
Overseas, on a jet for the cheese, fifteen hundred just for my jeans
All she know is big business, flexin' up 'cause I'm winnin'
Copped the foreign a new Bentley, she wanna peel with that [?]
Why they hatin', pull up Lamborghini, model bitches out the magazine
Lil' foreign put on for the team, makin' money, you can't intervene
One hundred, I can never switch up, too foreign, got my trunk in the front
Bad bitch, give her dick and a blunt, too greedy, talkin' 'bout what you want
Rich!

[Hook: Jeremih]
I don't wanna get greedy
She only calls when she needy
Got bands in the duffle
I count paper, don't read it
Call me Mister Big Shot
I hit then won't stop
Doing big, can't stop
She only calls when she needy
I don't wanna get greedy
She only calls when she needy
Got bands in the duffle
I count paper, don't read it
Call me Mister Big Shot
I hit then won't stop
Doing big, can't stop
She only calls when she needy
