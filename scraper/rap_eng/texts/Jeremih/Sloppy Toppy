[Intro]
Yeahh
Ayyyy
Ayyyy

[Verse]
Caught the snitch, I don't need another car
Shots after shot, man, I'm seein' stars
I hop on the stage an' leave off here with broads
I just went to a [?] for a massage
Headin' overseas, it's thirty abroad
Here to fuck shit up now with my posse
What's up in my cup, am I Cosby?
We ain't need no paparazzi
[?] goin' up an' now they flashin', flashin' (ha, yeah)
All I do is hit the bag and cash in, cash in
Cameras always rollin' like I'm with Kardashian
E'ry night a re-run, I'm like "what's happening?"
I stay at the W 'cause I'm a winner
So many breasts an' thighs, look like a chicken dinner

[Chorus]
[?]
E'ry three bitches, nigga, prolly, probably
They call me "Papi, Papi", gettin' sloppy toppy
In the left lane off a Maserati
Speedin' past blue, yeah, wide eyes
[?] y'all nigga, I might
They call me "Papi, Papi", gettin' sloppy toppy
In the left lane off a Maserati
Speedin' past blue, yeah, wide eyes
[?] y'all nigga, I might

[Bridge]
Yeahh
Ayyyy
Ayyyy

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
[?]
E'ry three bitches, nigga, prolly, probably
They call me "Papi, Papi", gettin' sloppy toppy
In the left lane off a Maserati
Speedin' past blue, yeah, wide eyes
[?] y'all nigga, I might
They call me "Papi, Papi", gettin' sloppy toppy
In the left lane off a Maserati
Speedin' past blue, yeah, wide eyes
[?] y'all nigga, I might
