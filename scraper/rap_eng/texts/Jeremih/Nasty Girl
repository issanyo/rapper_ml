Why you always talkin that nasty shit?

You know I be lovin that nasty shit
(she a nasty girl, she a nasty girl)

(Verse)
Uh, I keep bitches that like bitches
I eat bitches like dyke bitches (nasty)
You damn right, vamp life bitches
I take the roof off and on like light switchers
So now I'm down like three bands
I ain't Future but she kept getting free bands
I was on her like a nigga had three hands
Fat ass, bow legged how she stand
I told her come with me and cum me
She said the pussy cost money, she don't come for free
She said put a tax on it
Gratuity fee, I put a stack on it like

(Pre-Hook)
Why you always talkin that nasty shit?

Fat ass n shit, back it on my dick
I love you girl, you love the stick
Go and bend that back, I throw them racks
I'll work on that, work on that

(Verse)
I'm a dog, I don't need molly
Find your girl on her knees probably (my bad)
Pilla seen, she a cold bitch
She the stylest of the bitch of the whole ghet ?????
I'm a freak in the bedroom
She said she need head room
So I bang her head on the head rest (oops)
(then I put that ass on bed rest)
And I ain't scared, I eat the cooch
But, you know, first I gotta meet the coupe
And you know rich bitch speak the truth
That's the last time I speak to you

Fat ass n shit, back it on my dick

Go to work work work work work work work on er (nasty girl, she a nasty girl)
Said I go to work work work work work work work on er (nasty girl, she a nasty girl)

(Verse)
Back it over, ??????
Started off with ones, now the bills bigger
Your friend thirsty, get her a drink
You wyling out, I need a freak
She need a gee, I gave her two of em
Rock in my hand, that's two of us
Don't take no drinks for her to do something

(Gonna do that nasty shit on her)

Lovings what I love to do, that's what I came to do
That's what we gonna do, Thats what we gonna do
We talkin about park the car, hit you on top the car
That's what we gonna do, that's what we gonna do
And if you like that, I'll probably bite that
That's what I'm gonna do, That's what I'm gonna do
Whatever you want to, you bring your friends along
I'l bring my ??? along, I'll bring my ??? along (She a nasty girl, She a nasty girl)
