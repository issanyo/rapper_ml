[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Ride a little time on top
Girl, won't you do the thing your way
You know I got a brand new watch
Rollie, no time ticker
Baby cause it's our time
Ain't nothing wrong with it
When they say you have them funds
All I need is a bad lil bitch
Know what to do with a bag
Told you long time, I been that nigga
Now you gotta pay me in cash

[Hook: Jeremih]
Love that sound baby, love that sound baby
Love that sound baby, love that sound baby
Love that sound baby, love that sound baby
Love that sound baby, love that sound baby

[Verse 2: Sayyi]
I love that sound on the money counter
Stacks on stacks, counting on the counter
Counter on the counter, money on the hour
Lot of dirty money, gotta take a shower
Getting fresher than a dope boy, no powder
Got the tommy in the ghost and I ain't on Power
On the paper every 24, Jack Bauer
I don't fuck with no fakers, I don't know cowards
Yeah, I love that sound on the rubber bands
Bad bitch baguette on the way to France
No I.O.U., need it in advance
Get a snowball in hell, got a better chance
No way a nigga gon' be broke
Got bread on bread, that's doe see doe
My bank account kidnap 6 zero's
That new money, singing C-notes and I

[Hook: Jeremih]
Love that sound baby, love that sound baby
Love that sound baby, love that sound baby
Love that sound baby, love that sound baby
Love that sound baby, love that sound baby

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
Ride a little time on top
Girl, won't you do the thing your way
You know I got a brand new watch
Rollie, no time ticker
Baby cause it's our time
Ain't nothing wrong with it
When they say you have them funds
All I need is a bad lil bitch
Know what to do with a bag
Told you long time, I been that nigga
Now you gotta pay me in cash

[Hook: Jeremih]
Love that sound baby, love that sound baby
Love that sound baby, love that sound baby
Love that sound baby, love that sound baby
Love that sound baby, love that sound baby
