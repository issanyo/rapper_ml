[Intro]
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
(Jadakiss ) aw yeah *laughs*

[Verse One: Jadakiss]
I knew shorty was the one when I sent her O.T with a
Trunk full of dog food
I knew shorty fucked with me
Cause I hit her best friend
And after that we got more cool
Baby girl is a handful
There ain't really too much that she can't do (yeah)
You know me im just doing what a man do
All white on having dinner by the beach with the candles
So classy but so ghetto
It's either her way or nothing dog
She don't settle
Got the wine the bubble bath the rose petals
Thousands miles away from all the cold weather
She even know how to roll dog
She blow hella
She don't sit on her ass cause she a go getta
Therefore I don't mind letting her blow cheddar
And I ain't letting her go dog
I know better
Uh get em

[Verse Two : Nino man ]
I knew shorty was the one
When I had her in the hood doing things that these dudes can't
I knew shorty fucked with me
When she let me get mad seafood with her food stamps (haa)
But my shorty is a lady she ain't out here looking crazy
Likes these birds , I don't do tramps
She tell me all the time i'm the new champ (yup)
This music in my ear she a true amp(fire)
So you gotta peep hints
It's about we ma I don't speak French (woo)
See who riding with me I don't need tints(naa)
Rolled out in the Carter I ain't mean Vince (facts)
Got a place she ain't never seen
Where it's no buildings and got a better breeze
I know GOD blessed you and you ain't never sneezed
Im never on the back im always on the beat

(Jeremih) You heard ?

[Verse Three: Jeremih]
I think about all the time
Think you may need all of mine
Hate to say you know that love is blind
I'm 'bout to see, I'll close my eyes
(Truth is) They can't see you in here though
Most of them need dollar signs to make
Every day your birthday
And every night your Valentine

[Chorus]
If we tried that we could be
Somewhere the climate is warm, long as you around me
I swear that everything will be just fine
I wish that we could take some time
Go anywhere, baby I don’t mind
Grown man, in my suit and tie
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh, yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no we without you and I

[Verse Four: Jeremih]
See my baby know, where my baby go, I go It's no better feeling, you know when I’m next to her for sure Oh how can they hate? Gotta get this off my chest
Oh girl, I think I love you, I swear your shit look best
Friends, they know they hate, they don't get the best
Ah yea, I think I love you, oh baby maybe

[Chorus]
If we tried that we could be
Somewhere the climate is warm, long as you around me
I swear that everything will be just fine
I wish that we could take some time
Go anywhere, baby I don’t mind
Grown man, in my suit and tie
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh, yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no we without you and I
