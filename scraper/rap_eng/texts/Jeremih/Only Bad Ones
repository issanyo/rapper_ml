Girl you know I thought you let it go
I thought you let it go, I thought you let it go
Tell you maybe, I never tell you no
You know the feeling 'cause you give me feelings so
Feelings so, feelings so, medicals
You take me high now when you take me to the low
Where you goin' now? Probably later on
Tryna take er in and talk, 'cause we be somewhere in my home

Bad bitches only
Only bad ones, only bad ones

Yea, who can stop me now? Tell me how
Still N.O.R.E. but it's Papi now
Bad chicks, shoes crocodile
When dudes wanna style we just watch er now

Tequila in the cup and some ice with ya
Bring a couple friends, have a cup of this
And all the ugly ones you diss, you just tell em this

Only bad ones, only bad ones
Bad bitches only

Only bad ones, only bad ones

Girl you know I thought you let it go
I thought you let it go, I thought you let it go
Tell you maybe, I never tell you no

Feelings so, feelings so, medicals
You take me high now when you take me to the low
Where you goin' now? Probably later on
Tryna take er in and talk, 'cause we be somewhere in my home

Bad bitches on

I tell a bad bitch drink Ciroc with me
Tell a bad bitch hit the block with me
Hit the strip club, she gon' rock with me
And if I'm gon' pop shit, she gon' pop with me
She in the crib Instagramin on her favorite mirror
She the team captain, the team no filter
Good body suit, good dude, good shoe
My Tadow video made er twerk to

Only bad ones, only bad ones
Bad bitches only
Only bad ones
Bad bitches only
Only bad ones, only bad ones

Girl you know I thought you let it go
I thought you let it go, I thought you let it go
Tell you maybe, I never tell you no
You know the feeling 'cause you give me feelings so
Feelings so, feelings so, medicals
You take me high now when you take me to the low
Where you goin' now? Probably later on
Tryna take er in and talk, 'cause we be somewhere in my home

You frown and maybe this alright (it's alright)

On ice (on ice)

You see the squad baby, you see what's in your sight

Bad bitches only
Only bad ones, only bad ones
