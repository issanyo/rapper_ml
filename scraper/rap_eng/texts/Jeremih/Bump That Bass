[Verse 1]
Yes, yes, fresh in the flesh
I'm the best dressed and the best sex
I'm the dutch master
I'm jet set till I just sweat and my chest wet
'Cause I gotta flex like fuck master

Run that kush in the air
In a shirt, that casket 'cause the way that I be killing it

Two step with a slight hop to the right spot
'Cause I might holla at a honey
No sweat, ‘cause it might pop 'cause she probably know

All you independent bitch ass bullshit, party girls

Throw your hands to pop, you ain't tryina turn it down
