[Intro: Jeremih]
Yeah

[Hook: Jeremih]
I'd like to take the time to love your body
Rub your body, kiss, and hug your body
Girl say ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh I like
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh I like
So I'm gon take the time to love your body
Rub your body, kiss, and hug your body
Girl say ooh ooh ooh ooh I like
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh I like

[Jeremih]
Baby don't you know, I'm here to get my lesson
Somethin' 'bout your body, girl just gives me direction
How to find that spot
I ain't Young Money, girl, but my bed rock
So won't you let your hair down, let me take a picture
Tell me what's your zodiac, Cancer's my description
Girl and I don't stop
That's right we go from six to nine o'clock
I ain't too proud to beg, yeah
(You're a superstar, girl you are)
It's all up in my head, oh yeah
(Cause baby you and me need some privacy)

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Haha... Luda!
Let me touch your body, like when you be fresh up out the tub and you rub that lotion
Make you get on all fours and put one leg up like your body's doin' three-wheel motion
In the ocean toastin', overdosin', toastin' with the magic potion
Told them that they can't hold or control 'em; no one, I'm a Magnum Trojan
Golden like the wrapper lookin' dapper then I put her on her back and attack her
No time for the chitty chat, just give me ya kitty cat and you'll get it back after
We set the mood right, givin' you a little relaxation
I'mma get your groove right, take your body on a little vacation
We island hoppin, and clubs is rockin', and haters jockin'
Trunk pop lock droppin' and speakers knockin' and bottles poppin'
I could talk all day let me stimulate your mind while I tell you what I like in you
But for now I'mma just sit back, let Jeremih tell you what he'd like to do

[Hook]

[Outro: Jeremih]
Girl say, "I-I-I"
Girl say, "I-I-I"
Girl say, "I-I-I"
Girl say...
