(Intro)
And like that, we gone
Baby, relax, sun 'bout to come up
Ah for real
Who’s that lady?
Ah for real
It’s real

(Hook)
Haven’t you noticed I had my eyes on you, you, you
Girl you know it’s something, something, something
When we got to touching, touching, touching
I’ll be all ma-maybe you should come through, through, through
We could get poppin’, poppin’, poppin’
The neighbors knockin’, knockin’, knockin’

YG:
Girl it’s something ’bout you, you, you, you
Ugh,and you know my flag red
But shawty God damn
Girl I got the blues, blues, blues, blues
And that thing in the back so fat
It’s a couple of things that
I wanna do, do, do, do to you, you, you ugh
Yeah, see I’ma show you baby
‘Cause you can’t notice
And I don’t promise
A promises is made to be broken
But I’m a freak girl I do it with my tongue
And you bang, bang, bang and that’s not with a gun
What that teasing be 'bout?
I put your feet in my mouth
And the bed fucked up
So we sleep on the couch ugh
She say her boyfriend at home and I say so
‘Cause when I say go - you know

(Hook)
Haven’t you noticed I had my eyes on you, you, you
Girl you know it’s something, something, something
When we got to touching, touching, touching
I’ll be all ma-maybe you should come through, through, through
We could get poppin’, poppin’, poppin’
The neighbors knockin’, knockin’, knockin’

E40
She like a man that's hard headed, heart made of granite
Dick game dummy leave her stuck, stranded
The neighbours knockin’ ’cause they hatin’ they can’t stand it
Especially when I get behind her like a ad-lib
She love it when a gangsta act silly
She love to be around my artillery
Captivated by illegal activity
Her attitude ugly but her body is pretty
When we break up to make up she wake up
She look good in the morning without no make-up
Sometimes I lie like Eddie Haskell
So I dive in and put her legs on my clavicle
He used to buy her flowers but I think he forgot
Now she got a G like me hitting her G spot
Suckin' on her titties, I’m original, stop
Bang, bang, bang, Friday, Pops

(Hook)
Haven’t you noticed I had my eyes on you, you, you
Girl you know it’s something, something, something
When we got to touching, touching, touching
I’ll be all ma-maybe you should come through, through, through
We could get poppin’, poppin’, poppin’
The neighbors knockin’, knockin’, knockin’
