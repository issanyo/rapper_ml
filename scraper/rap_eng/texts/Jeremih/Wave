[Intro: Jeremih]
Oh Lord, have mercy, mercy, mercy
Rude gyal like to party, party, party
Dem all of dem sexy, sexy, sexy
Watch them just to follow me, follow me, follow me, hey

[Verse 1: Veronica Vega]
True love is a cruel intention, we do it anyway
Overdose, got a sick intervention, ain't no running away, yeah
A million things I could mention, I might name a few
Make me wanna give it all to the right one, what you doing to me?

[Pre-Chorus: Veronica Vega & Jeremih]
Got me running right back to you
Like I'm chasing shooting stars
Coming right home to ya
Like I never go too far
Baby, on nights like this, for the world I wouldn't miss it, oh
And we dance like the water

[Chorus: Veronica Vega & Jeremih]
'Cause step by step, get lost in your love
Inspired, I'm getting closer to you
Every time, can't get enough
Enjoy the ride, hold on tight
We going mash up and match up
The tide go low, we bring it back up
The tide go low, we bring it back up
The tide go low, we bring it back up
Got me on my wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, ayy
Got me on my wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave
Got me on the wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, ayy
Got me on the wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Dread on the remix
Smoke somethin', eyes red as a phoenix
Go hard, pint it, baby, meant to see me
I make your girl 'bout the wave 'til she seasick
I'll leave her body on some fleek shit, If she lit
I make her leave that boy alone, he anaemic
She left a note next to her thongs, said I keep them
And I'm so wavey, I'm just wondering if she swim
Okay, Tunechi and Veronica
I couldn't say that shit right there loud enough
That shit sound good to me, I'm not gon' front
You look too good to me, I'm tryna', let me stop
Lookin' like a lemon drop, I'm Young Money echelon
I got more pairs than pappadom but you got more ass than never mind
Hidin' from me servin' time, only she like turbo time
You say you got the waves, baby, I'm just tryna surf inside

[Pre-Chorus: Veronica Vega & Jeremih]
Got me running right back to you
Like I'm chasing shooting stars
Coming right home to ya
Like I never go too far
Baby, on nights like this, for the world I wouldn't miss it, oh
And we dance like the water

[Chorus: Veronica Vega & Jeremih]
'Cause step by step, get lost in your love
Inspired, I'm getting closer to you
Every time, can't get enough
Enjoy the ride, hold on tight
We going mash up and match up
The tide go low, we bring it back up
The tide go low, we bring it back up
The tide go low, we bring it back up
Got me on my wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, ayy
Got me on my wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, oh, oh
Got me on the wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, ayy
Got me on the wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, wave, oh, oh

[Outro: Jeremih]

Oh Lord, have mercy, mercy, mercy
