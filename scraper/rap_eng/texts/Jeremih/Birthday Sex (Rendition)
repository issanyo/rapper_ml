[Verse 1]
It's my birthday, so you know you gotta ride out
Even if we only go to my house
Sip mo-eezy as we sit upon my couch
Feels good but I know you want to cry out
You say you want passion and I think you found it
Get ready for action, don't be astounded
We switchin' positions, you feel so rounded
Just tell me where's my gift, girl?

[Hook]
Girl you know I-I-I, girl you know I-I-I, I been fiending
Wake up in the late night, been dreamin' about you lovin'
Girl you know I-I-I, girl you know I-I-I
Don't need candles and cake, just need your body to make
Birthday sex
Birthday sex
It's the best day of the year, girl
Birthday sex
Birthday sex
It feels like, feels like
Lemme hit that G-spot, G-spot

[Verse 2]
See you sexy and 'em jeans got me on ten
One, two, three, ding, I got you pinned
Don't tap out, fight until the end
Ring that bell and we gonna start over again
We gridin' with passion 'cause it's my birthday
Been at it for hours, I know you thirsty
You kiss me so sweetly, taste just like Hershey's
Just lemme have you as my gift, girl

[Hook]
Girl you know I-I-I, girl you know I-I-I, I been fiending
Wake up in the late night, been dreamin' about you lovin'
Girl you know I-I-I, girl you know I-I-I
Don't need candles and cake, just need your body to make
Birthday sex
Birthday sex
It's the best day of the year, girl
Birthday sex
Birthday sex
It feels like, feels like
Lemme hit that G-spot, G-spot

[Verse 3]
First, I'm gonna take a dive into the water
Deep until I know I pleased that body, that body
Or girl, without a broom I might just sweep you off your feet
And make you wanna tell somebody, somebody how I do
Or maybe we can float on top my waterbed (bed)
You close your eyes as I improv between your legs (your legs)
We work our way from kitchen stoves and tables
Girl you know I'm only able to please (oooh yeah)

[Hook]
Girl you know I-I-I, girl you know I-I-I, I been fiending
Wake up in the late night, been dreamin' about you lovin'
Girl you know I-I-I, girl you know I-I-I
Don't need candles and cake, just need your body to make
Birthday sex
Birthday sex
It's the best day of the year, girl
Birthday sex
Birthday sex
It feels like, feels like
Lemme hit that G-spot, G-spot
