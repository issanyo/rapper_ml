[Hook: Jeremih]
Uh girl, I'ma show you what it's made for
Ain't that what you came for?
You ain't gotta say something
I know you want it bad
You get enough, I know you like it rough
So I'ma put my name on your love
Like a TATTOO, oh ah, too, oh ah
Like a TATTOO, oh ah, too, oh ah

[Verse 1: Gillie Da Kid]
Yeah, I ain't got no problems spending no change on it
If she bad enough I'ma tat her up, let me put my name on it
She tells me pull her hair, tell me smack her from the rear
She says she likes it rough, the harder I go it hypes the rush
So you know a nigga pipe the rock
One or two times is not enough
Then it's one to the next
That means another one bites the dust
Buffing out, we on that Pete Ciroc
Soon as we hit the spot we ride that in homie keep the lot
When she on top she loves to scream a lot
She saying Gillie, Gillie, please don't stop
Shawty backing so I had to do it
I texted that ass and she returned, Jackson Hewitt!

[Hook: Jeremih]
Uh girl, I'ma show you what it's made for
Ain't that what you came for?
You ain't gotta say something
I know you want it bad
You get enough, I know you like it rough
So I'ma put my name on your love
Like a TATTOO, oh ah, too, oh ah
Like a TATTOO, oh ah, too, oh ah

[Verse 2: Gillie Da Kid}
Yeah, see you so fine I'ma come a tattoo my name
Not on your skin, see I tattoo your brain
So Gillie's on your mind and I'm talking permanently
(Forever?)
For days and god damn it I love your fragrance
You smell so right your face so pretty
Your jeans so tight, wanna eat tonight
If you with me tonight I'm gonna sour in that lean a night
And I swear you got the nicest hips
Yeah you so sexy when you bite your lips
That thing so wet I swear I might just slip
But I think so tight I named it vice and grips
And all she do is back it up
One get lead to slap it up
Autograph that thing, I leave it tatted up

[Hook: Jeremih]
Uh girl, I'ma show you what it's made for
Ain't that what you came for?
You ain't gotta say something
I know you want it bad
You get enough, I know you like it rough
So I'ma put my name on your love
Like a TATTOO, oh ah, too, oh ah
Like a TATTOO, oh ah, too, oh ah

[Outro: Jeremih]
Baby tell me that it's mine
I wanna hear you say my name
Baby say my name
Lay down, come lay down
You know I'ma tat it up
Every time I tear it up
