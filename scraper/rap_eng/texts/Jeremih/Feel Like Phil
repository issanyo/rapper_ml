[Hook]
I didn't come here for nothing
I need a whole lot of money
Crossing these hoes out to fade away
Putting your bitches on layaway
Niggas they know me from stuntin'
All of my whips is push button
Feeling like Phil when I make the play
I light the streets where you are
I only need to hit it one time
Keep on them red bottom Louboutin's
Play with that pussy on the 101
I light the streets where you are
I got a bad bitch that's 21
I make her do the things she's never done
Feeling like Phil when I make the play
Everything will be a-okay

[Verse 1]
Now I think about it man as long as I keep doing me and you keep doing you
I ain't gotta worry about nobody's paper long as mine's just coming and it's blue
Turn the yacht into Noah's Arch, I'm getting bitches and they come in by the two
Only nigga in here asking questions, see only real question, nigga who is you
I ain't worried 'bout it, now I'm on a roll, I don't hear nobody, tryna be myself
I made it here, it ain't no miracle, copped the new Ghost, I'm invisible
From January to December, flexin on niggas Arm & Hammer
Tell me what I wanted, I can handle, talk about dirty, that's my grammar
Taladega nights, runnin' through the lights, Ricky Bobby, I be cruisin'
I just did a song with 50 Cent, don't give a fuck about a nigga  two cents
Overseas, talkin' guapanese, twisting lids with big bottles, you know it
As long as you know that

[Hook]
I did not come here from nothin'
I need a whole lot of money
Crossing these hoes out to fade away
Putting your bitches on layaway
Niggas they know me from stuntin'
All of my whips is push button
Feeling like Phil when I make the play
I light the streets where you are
I only need to hit one time
Keep on them red bottom Louboutin's
Play with that pussy on the 101
I light the streets where you are
I got a bad bitch that's 21
I make her do the things she's never done
Feeling like Phil when I make the play
Everything will be a-okay
