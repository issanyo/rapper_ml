It's Jeremih, mih, mih, mih, mih
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la

Be my, be my, be my, be my
Be my body operator, don't say what's on your mind
Get loose, get loose, get loose
Even know I'm the one
Seen you like my girls in the toos
They get goose, goose, goose
Loose like, loose like, loose like

I think I found my baby, oh, hey, hey
Tonight we take it, 1 shot, 2 shots, 3 shots, 4
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
Go way down
I love it when you drop down
A romantic bomb
Dollar bills bout to go out a storm
So I lit up the safe, she pick up the pace
The girls getting wild so we drink out the bass
The way you do me got me tempted to taste
Like come here closer, we don't need space

All across the world, we party, eeeheee
All night long, come on
Tonight we take it, 1 shot, 2 shots, 3 shots, 4
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
The moment when you beat me to ground
I need you like I beat up the sound
I wanna meet the woman in my town
I hope that booty not down
Cause you shake it like you moving, like you moving
Like it's jelly
Crush it when you move with your belly
Take off you r clothes, we can do it acapelle
Go to the movie, go to the tellie, yeah
And do what you wanna, toast to the night now
Sleep till the morning, you, me and a mona
Lisa and marijuana
Wanna live the life of the man who knows

I think I found my baby, oh, hey, hey
Bring the beat back!
Tonight we take it, 1 shot, 2 shots, 3 shots, 4
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
Spinking, jeremih
Finally another one baby!
