[Chorus]
Got Givenchy all on my back
I turn a brown bag into a sack
Most of y'all don't know what to do with that
Hit a lick and don't know what to do with that
Your bitch, she know what she doin'
I heard she know what to do with that
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney
Yeah, wearin' Off-White in a coupe black
She know I know what to do with that
Say you don't know what to do with that
Don't know what love got to do with that
Verified bank, blew a check
Show me you know what to do with that

[Verse]
All black lingerie, she took that Off-White off my back
I barely could take off my Balmains, I stacked too many racks
It's not too many left, Juli' blanc on my breath
Backwood asthma on my chest, I'm just too chill to relax
Got the hook like a right, when I hit from the side
Only cash out massage, no, no, work out a knot
I thumb it, thumb it, paper cuttin'
ChaseTheMoney, doin' numbers
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney

[Chorus]
Got Givenchy all on my back
I turn a brown bag into a sack
Most of y'all don't know what to do with that
Hit a lick and don't know what to do with that
Your bitch, she know what she doin'
I heard she know what to do with that
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney
Yeah, wearin' Off-White in a coupe black
She know I know what to do with that
Say you don't know what to do with that
Don't know what love got to do with that
Verified bank, blew a check
Show me you know what to do with that
