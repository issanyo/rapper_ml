[Chorus: Starrah]
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
After blunt after blunt after, hey
Cup after cup, gotta double that up
I've been waitin' on this all day
Nigga pass that shit, yeah

Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
After blunt after blunt after, hey
Cup after cup, gotta double that up
I've been waitin' on this all day
Nigga pass that shit
Nigga pass that shit
Nigga pass that shit, yeah

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
The blunt up, the blunt up, the blunt up, the blunt up today
I called up the Uber but then I pulled out the Range
Grab that shit, yeah
Then grab that bitch
I roll up to pull up, I'm stuntin', I'm stuntin', hey
I smoke up to pull up, I pull up and I'm like, "hey"
That's that nigga
Yeah, yeah that's that nigga

[Chorus: Starrah]
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
After blunt after blunt after, hey
Cup after cup, gotta double that up
I've been waitin' on this all day
Nigga pass that shit, yeah
Nigga pass that shit
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
After blunt after blunt after, hey
Cup after cup, gotta double that up
I've been waitin' on this all day
Nigga pass that shit
Nigga pass that shit
Nigga pass that shit, yeah
Nigga pass that shit

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
What you women talkin' 'bout?
I only wanna get up there
A bad bitch rollin' up some good
Light it up and hand me it
All I wanna do, trouble up
Extendo doubled up
Tired as fuck ain't no more work
Ease my mind, that's where it hurt
Pull up in somethin' that go skrrt
Fishtailin' like we Dirk
Feel like Ray J for the purp
Come and let me hit it first
I'ma pass it if it's some gas
I'ma pull up, might forget to ask
Smokin' Ivory, passin' plenty tabs
Roll the 'Wood up so it can last

[Chorus: Starrah]
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
After blunt after blunt after, hey
Cup after cup, gotta double that up
I've been waitin' on this all day
Nigga pass that shit, yeah
Nigga pass that shit
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
After blunt after blunt after, hey
Cup after cup, gotta double that up
I've been waitin' on this all day
Nigga pass that shit
Nigga pass that shit
Nigga pass that shit, yeah
Nigga pass that shit
