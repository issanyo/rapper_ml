[Intro: Bobby Brackins]
Bobby Brackins (Jeremih)
Hitta 180

[Chorus: Jeremih]
No, no, no offence, your face is so pretty
Baby get with me but turn around (Turn Around)
180 grind on me baby, dance on me crazy
Turn around
Hitta 180, hitta 180
Hitta 180, hitta 1-1, hitta 180 baby

[Verse 1: Bobby Brackins]
Baby how you doing? It's time to have some fun
Meet me at the party, I'll be there before it's done
Probably chilling with my pals, sippin' something good
Blowing on the good, smoking like those backwoods
Your body gotta be smoking if I'ma be poking
Skin real soft without the coco butter lotion
I'm wishing and I'm hoping for you to turn around
We can sip bub, sip clear, burn it down
We can take pictures and make movies
Whisper in your ear, feeling your booty
I need a cutie to go hard and do dirt
Baby turn around, hitta U-turn, 180 baby

[Chorus: Jeremih]
No, no, no offence, your face is so pretty
Baby get with me but turn around (Turn Around)
180 grind on me baby, dance on me crazy
Turn around
Hitta 180, hitta 180
Hitta 180, hitta 1-1, hitta 180 baby

[Verse 2: Bobby Brackins]
Turn around on me, you know how I like it
Might get hard, go hard, I'm excited
Baby come ride it, ride it like a hybrid
Move a little closer, now we're vibin
Pop another bottle it's time for a toast
Yeah I get bread, we can burn no toast
Like a, like a slow roast, keep that thang juicing
I'ma get rich, get just like the jacuzzis
So we could fly away like Lenny Kravitz
Your cake something nice
Wanna bite, wanna grab it
I really wanna have it, hitta 180
Girl turn around cuz that round thang cakey
Keep shaking

[Chorus: Jeremih]
No, no, no offence, your face is so pretty
Baby get with me but turn around (Turn Around)
180 grind on me baby, dance on me crazy
Turn around
Hitta 180, hitta 180
Hitta 180, hitta 1-1, hitta 180 baby

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Yeah I see you baby, tell me what you want
Show me what you thinking, tell me what you don't
Say you looking good, ma got that shit, them others don't
Let me take your [?], welcome to my restaurant
You sexy, oh don't got to prove it
Don't make love to me, make love to my music
Me plus you shorty let's just do the math
I know your 360 but give a player half

[Chorus: Jeremih]
No, no, no offence, your face is so pretty
Baby get with me but turn around (Turn Around)
180 grind on me baby, dance on me crazy
Turn around
Hitta 180, hitta 180
Hitta 180, hitta 1-1, hitta 180 baby

[Outro: Bobby Brackins & Jeremih]

Let me let you take 'em down
Oh

Baby won't you break it down, down, down
