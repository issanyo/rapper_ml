[Intro]
Tonight we have an unbelievable new talent for you ladies and gentlemen and for the folks watching at home
Debuting his new single "You're Mine" that'll have you on your feet in no time at all
Please give a warm welcome to Jeremih!

Do do do do, do do; do do do do, do do (O-o-oh, o-o-oh, o-o-oh, o-o-oh) [x5]
Yeah I see you baby, you looking real good tonight
With your dress on and the [?] songs
It is Christmas Eve and we having a good time!
But you better watch out for that mistletoe I tell you!

[Verse 1]
This the weather I've been longing for
Together we'll be nice and warm
Oh, baby baby just an ounce of time
The memory would last for life

[Hook]
If maybe we get just a little bit closer, ohh
And no one's here to stop us, just a little bit - oh! (Ohh)
Just tell me would you stay:

You're mine, you're mi-i-i-i-i-ine (on this Christmas
You're mine, you're mi-i-i-i-i-ine (underneath the mistletoe)
You're mine, you're mi-i-i-i-i-ine (ohhh)
You're mine, you're mi-i-i-i-i-ine

[Verse 2]
'Tis the season I give you love
Yep, the reason I can give enough
Girl it's like you came under the Christmas tree
Yep, you're such a special gift to me (yeahh)

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Oh! Yeah. Am I asking for too much?
I mean I know it's Christmas and..
It's all about giving baby
Yeah. O-o-oh. (Haha)

Breakdown!
Ooh, ooh, ooh (O-o-oh, o-o-oh, o-o-oh, o-o-oh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
