[Intro-Jeremih]
Freaky, freaky girl breakin' hearts around the world (no lie)
She’s a jet set lover, killer undercover, the devil you can see it in her eyes

[DJ Technikz – talking]
Aight, you know we gotta represent for our T.H.R.A.B’s, right?
You know the Thirsty Hoes Ready and Bop it, then you gotta do it for the flexin' T.H.R.A.B’s too
You know, these hoes really ain’t bougie

[Verse 1-Quez +  Strap da Fool ]
She broke my heart and my bank account
Im deep in a trance and I ain't comin out
Bankroll on me but I'm running out
All that ass in them pants keep comin out
I fucked this ho til I turn her out
I smoke my dro I pass around
Put down that lil reggie but she got good sex
Ya, ya thats what Im talkin about
You see this AP gleamin
Girl I see you cheesin
For some reason
You just keep teasing
You know I want you baby
You know I need you girl
Before I leave this club tonight
Need me a freaky girl
You, you a sight to see
I ain't even gon' lie
You, you gon' ride with me fuck them other guys
You got me hypnotized them lil things you do
And you got them big thighs with that little bitty waist on you

[Chorus — Jeremih]
Freaky, freaky girl breakin' hearts around the world
She’s a jet set lover, killer undercover, the devil you can see it in her eyes
Freaky, freaky girl breakin' hearts around the world (no lie)
She’s a jet set lover, killer undercover, the devil in a dress is her disguise

[Verse 2 — Jeremih]
Brainstorm set up
Bet you won’t forget her
Sw-sw-swear to God lil mama make you wa-wa-want spend it all on a purse and some pu-pu-pumps
Good girl gone bad with that badonk-donk-donk
I never gotta, never got enough-nough-nough
And since I ain’t seen her enough-nough-nough, she want me to beat it up-up-up-up
Shit should be painless, said she wanted to be famous
And she was just cool with entertainers
S-so I gave her that steel, didn’t leave it stainless
Yeah on the real kn-knew she was dangerous

[Chorus — Jeremih]
Freaky, freaky girl breakin' hearts around the world
She’s a jet set lover, killer undercover, the devil you can see it in her eyes
Freaky, freaky girl breakin' hearts around the world (no lie)
She’s a jet set lover, killer undercover, the devil in a dress is her disguise

[Verse 3 — Ali]
Cause she my personal lover, killer undercover
Known to fuck around, so I got's to use a rubber
Nasty motherfucka, loves it when I touch her
Askin' me to hug her, while skeetin' all on my covers
She loves when I fuck her, loves it when I beat it
Loves it when I lick her, she askin' me can I eat it
I’ll never mistreat it, she said that I’m the greatest
We do it all night, she fuck me until I fainted, uhh
She pretty so we do it with the lights on
I love it when she suck me up with ice, though
Yeah, she’s a freaky, freaky girl
I wanna fuck that pussy all around the world (yeah, haha)

[Chorus — Jeremih]
Freaky, freaky girl breakin' hearts around the world
She’s a jet set lover, killer undercover, the devil you can see it in her eyes
Freaky, freaky girl breakin' hearts around the world (no lie)
She’s a jet set lover, killer undercover, the devil in a dress is her disguise

[Bridge — Quez]
She’s a freaky girl, you a freaky girl
Are you that freaky girl that I’ve been needing girl?
You wear a dress as your disguise, don’t look in her eyes
Cause she’ll turn your ass to stone
Ok these freaky, freaky girls all around the world
Baby get down on your knees and give me what I need
And if that is a problem, you can grab your purse and keys
I’m talking freaky, freaky girls all around the world (yeah)
Ok she never say she love me, she always bring a buddy
Her body talking to me and her eyes are screaming fuck me (damn)

[Chorus — Jeremih]
Freaky, freaky girl breakin' hearts around the world
She’s a jet set lover, killer undercover, the devil you can see it in her eyes
Freaky, freaky girl breakin' hearts around the world (no lie)
She’s a jet set lover, killer undercover, the devil in a dress is her disguise
