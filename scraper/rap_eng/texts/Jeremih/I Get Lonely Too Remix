[Jeremih]

Shawty, I just wanna spend some quiet time
And look up at the stars so you won’t forget me
About as pretty as the skyline
On December 31 throwing up confetti
If I started kissing all on your smile
Maybe hit your spot when you wasn’t ready
And somehow end up on my way down
Would you make me stop, tell me would you let me?
This is make or break up, wake up, something on your mind that you’re thinking
Thinking, something’s all mine
Two, Three, Four times, winter so chilling somewhere on the coast line
You know when it’s showtime
When we both hit the feeling and both of our adrenaline’s are rushing
I’ll make sure that its yo time
That we will get the wasting with the sun anticipation
Let’s just face it I can tell it by your faces
Baby, ya break me, lets do it big like Vegas
Can a man get a vow? As I put it down, yea yea

Just like you, yeah, I get lonely too
Just like you, yeah, I get lonely

[Drake]
Baby
I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don’t tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me
To another place where I’ll be
Face to face, just you and me
With no rules, just like you
I get lonely too ooh ooh
Hoo ooh hoh, hoo ooh hoh
Just like you
I get lonely too ooh ooh
Hoo ooh hoh
Just like you
I get lonely

Just like you
I get lonely too

[Drake]
Baby
I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don’t tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me
To another place where I’ll be
Face to face, just you and me
With no rules, just like you
I get lonely too ooh ooh
Hoo ooh hoh
Hoo ooh hoh
Just like you
I get lonely too
