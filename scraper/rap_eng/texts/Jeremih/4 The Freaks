This ones for my freaks
Loving for my freaks
Kissing on my freaks
Kissing on my freaks
I'm riding with my freaks
I'm good with bout two freaks
This ones for my streets
This ones for the freaks
This ones for the freaks
I got one for the peeps
In the middle now i won't stop, whats in between these sheets
I pull on Valet, like this ones for the freaks
This ones for the freaks
This ones for the freaks

Verse 1

We taking all my time, you know i can pace it
Won't you look at my face, i told her to lasik
Tryin' to teach me something, you know I'ma ace it
She said "J, that's a whole blunt" I said "Bitch face it"
She grinning, looking over, and bending it over
I love it when she throw that, she threw it once more for me
I go to the stripper pole and throw all of that paper
The DJ throwing up love, and I'm just throwing up more
My girl go on at 3, she go upside down, round the pole
If anything she don't play, no games, face down, now you know
Throw the money like raining, baby
So girl you know, you know i love you baby
The way you do that thang on me, swear you wanna go crazy for me

(Chorus)

Bridge

Spinning all in her head
Showing all of them legs
That's when she said "I'll take you, I'll take you there, I'll take you there"
Welcome to the bed of red roses, I'll make it wet, I'll make it wet, I'll make it wet
Girl you better not tell me that it's over

(Chorus)
