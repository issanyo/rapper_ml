[Verse 1:Dorrough]
Bitches and niggas be thinkin they know me
They be like, "how is this nigga so famous and stiil be remaining so low key?"
They way they be lookin and watchin and stalkin me i swear they worser than police
I do what i want to do, like it or not im still gonna get respect from the OGs


[Hook]

[Verses 2: Trevyn the Jynx]
Nigga a toaster, a fucking vulture,takin our  lingo, sellin foreclosure
Hes team be sellin them drugs, team is a bunch of fucked up dopeheads
Sooner or later,youre probably will  realize i am the one who is not
Most of these niggas is phony and if you dont know it yet, i am the one who is not
Say what you wanna say,do what you wanna do
Ima do me while i get to these guap
Matter fact soon as i pull out the lot
Ima speed out and go beat up the block
Nigga distorted, i need a lawyer
Lil mama, just let me spoil ya
Niggas always beslicker than that  oil
Way too much paper, i need a folder

(Hook)
