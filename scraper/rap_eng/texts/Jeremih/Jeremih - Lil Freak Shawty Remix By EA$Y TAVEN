Looking for a freak
A geek
And she on fleek
In My sheets mama
All day she a trick
Or a treat
And sweet
Go on eat
Lil freak shawty
Yeahhh

Verse 1

We can take it down
Anyhow, anytime
I’m always ready
Every time is my favorite time
We can do it all night
If you alright
If you do something bad
I will always take the crime
I just wanna
Call you mine
We can finally
Have some private time
Them other boys
Ain't special for you
Them other boys
Weren't mearnt for you

Bridge

Together you & me
We can be loyal
Together you & me
We can be loyal
Them other boys
Weren't mearnt for you
Them other boys
Ain't special for you

Verse 2

I can't stop staring
I can't stop looking
I just wanna touch the body
Wanna put you in my hoody
I think we should make a movie
Then go and watch the movie
I think we should be groovy
Be Grovie

Verse 3

Came from the bottom
Then to the middle class
Now I'm aiming upper class
I was raised in the dust
That was way before the beef
No continental drift
12 pm on my shift
Way back
When I needed lifts
When they where
Lookin down
I was always thinking up
Money got me motivated
I’m so weak for the temptation
I'm always on that work
It's like swimming
In the lake
Around me too many fakes
Around too many cracks
All I pray for
Is a cheque

Outro

Don't bother me
When I'm working
Look at the history
That I’m making
I remember
When I was not popping
And still I’m not popping
I should keep on praying
Keep on sacrificing
Yeah yeah
