[Intro]
Aah, ooouuu, aah

[Chorus]
Aah, ooouuu, aah
Oh give me that, give me that, give me that
Aah, ooouuu, aah
I'm riding like a nympho
Aah, aah, aah
Tonight I'm with all that
Aah, ooouuu, aah

[Verse 1]
Bring your nympho to my spot, promise I give you all I got
Baseball bat, I hit your spot, he don't do that for you why not?
She got a thing for ecstasy, she got that RiRi sex with me (sex with me)
Someone to offer her all night
We just got done, she want more time

[Chorus]
Aah, ooouuu, aah
Oh, give me that, give me that, give me that
Aah, ooouuu, aah
I'm riding like a nympho
Aah, aah, aah
Tonight I'm with all that
Aah, ooouuu, aah

[Verse 2]
Already got a pretty face, but your 'fuck face' better
Know you from the burbs, bust it like you from the ghetto
Do show legs, to the silly red bottoms
Had to put her face down in the pillow, neighbors kept screamin' shut up
We don't date, we just get up
Been strokin' that neck so long feel like a nigga been doin' sit-ups
Blowin' that gas, Backwoods full of fill ups
Time past, you can't keep up with us
All night

[Chorus]
Aah, ooouuu, aah
Oh, give me that, give me that, give me that
Aah, ooouuu, aah
I'm riding like a nympho
Aah, aah, aah
Tonight I'm with all that
Aah, ooouuu, aah
