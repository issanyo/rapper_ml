[Verse 1: Keke Palmer]
I bite my tongue, it never hurt so bad
Keep wanting you to cross that line
I keep trying to get you to react
It never happens every time

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih + Keke Palmer]
Now you're flowing through my veins
There's one thing to cure this pain
I want you inside of me
Can you fill this empty space?

[Chorus: Keke Palmer]
This ain't enough for me
Gotta be honest, I want you to lust for me
And if we're just friends I'd rather be your enemy
So we can do all the things you're holding back from me
So let's be enemies, yeah
I know you keep your friends close
I know you keep your enemies closer, yeah
I know you keep your friends close
I know you keep your enemies closer, yeah

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
I'm gonna change the way you look at me
I'll put desire in your eyes
And I can't wait to see your fantasies
I can make you come alive

[Pre-Chorus: Keke Palmer]
Now you're flowing through my veins
There's one way to cure this pain
I want you inside of me
Can you fill this empty space?

[Chorus: Keke Palmer]
This ain't enough for me
Gotta be honest, I want you to lust for me
And if we're just friends I'd rather be your enemy
So we can do all the things you're holding back from me
So let's be enemies, yeah
I know you keep your friends close
I know you keep your enemies closer, yeah
I know you keep your friends close
I know you keep your enemies closer, yeah

[Bridge: Keke Palmer]
I've been on my worst behavior
I want you to punish me
I bet you that I can take it
All this fake shit just ain't enough for me

[Chorus: Keke Palmer]
Gotta be honest, I want you to lust for me
And if we're just friends I'd rather be your enemy
So we can do all the things you're holding back from me
So let's be enemies, yeah
I know you keep your friends close
I know you keep your enemies closer, yeah
I know you keep your friends close
I know you keep your enemies closer, yeah
