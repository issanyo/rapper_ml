[Chorus]
I know there’s love in my vault
Only thing that I want is someone to want me, yeah
Put your ear to my thoughts
Only thing that I want is someone to hold me, hold me

[Verse 1]
You know my heart’s been defeated
Yeah, it’s beat to the core
Who’ll be there for my healing
When I open that door?
Boy, don’t play with my feelings
Just to fill in a void
Put your love in my safe
Oh, I’ll keep it safe

[Chorus]
I know there’s love in my vault
Only thing that I want is someone to want me, yeah
Put your ear to my thoughts
Only thing that I want is someone to hold me, hold me

[Bridge]
Oh, it get a little lonely sometimes
Sometimes I wish you would slide in on my carpet, baby
Right here in my room
Oh, I wanna make you breakfast in bed, baby—butt naked
Someone to hold me down, oh
Someone to fit the crown
Someone that deserves it
Good life on purpose

[Chorus]
There’s love in my vault
Only thing that I want is someone to hold me, yeah, yeah
Put your ear to my thoughts
Only thing that I want is someone to hold me, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
(…hold me) Do it ‘cause you want to…
(…want me)
(…hold me)
(…want me)
(…hold me)
(…want me)
