[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
It's better when you hug me
When it's snowing down
Ain't no fireplace burning
On this side of town
Don't throw salt on 'em
Angels on the ground
Do a little window shopping
Later on downtown

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
I been saving all year to spend some M's
If you had a twinny twin, I spend again
She love it when I light the tree
It's that time of year
On her Insta taking pics now Michigan
Big wheelin' ferris wheel like Navy Pier
Don't you vibe with a nigga
Get that show you right
Take you round Chicago get that show you right
Hit up Chano get you finished with the 309
I must say that this time around
Feels better with you, yes it's true

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
It's better when you hug me
When it's snowing down
Ain't no fireplace burning
On this side of town
Don't throw salt on 'em
Angels on the ground
Do a little window shopping
Later on downtown

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Ooh Tiny Tim thought you would get a nice Nintendo
Ain't yo momma told you that this year that all the ends low
Ain't yo momma told you bout inviting all your friends though
Ain't yo broke ass uncle busting juggs up out the Venmo
Ain't you tired of staying outside and freezing while the wind blow
Ain't it been some time since you seen Santa with no send off
Chatham ain't get no gifts, shit, Chatham ain't get no wish
So Chano gon' take that list, pssh, we ain't no bitch!
I am thumbing through a check for some kids from the south side
We don't get respect on the black or the brown side
Rats in the school, ain't no class in the pool
We gon' act us a fool 'til we have something too!

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
It's better when you hug me
When it's snowing down
Ain't no fireplace burning
On this side of town
Don't throw salt on 'em
Angels on the ground
Do a little window shopping
Later on downtown

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
