[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Darling just dive right in and follow my lead
I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I wanna give you all this time
But darling just kiss me slow
Love is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus 1]
Baby I'm dancing in the dark
Oh with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it "No you look perfect tonight"

[Verse 2]
Oh I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She's just my dreams I hope that someday I share her hope
I found a love
To carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of their own
We are still kids but we are so in love
Fighting against our lords
I know it'll be alright this time
Darling just throw my end
And my glow will be your man
I've seen my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling you look perfect tonight
Oh

[Chorus 2]
Baby I'm dancing in the dark
Oh with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect tonight
