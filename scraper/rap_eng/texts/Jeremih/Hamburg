[Hook: Jeremih]
Two-piece in a two-seater
Double cup, need a two liter
I'm about to hit twice, yeah
I'ma call that a two-peater
Roll two blunts, two reefers
All I need is about two beepers
Hit me up when you need that

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
I'm about it if you with that
I got that service at the alley
She threw it back, I lost my balance
I work it up, got that work
Mr. Late Nights call me Fallon
Light skin but taste chocolate
Oh you got that Fannie Mae
I just wanna roll, roll up
All I know is 'bout the Lambo that goes (vroom vroom) With the doors up
Had to speak a different language, I said "Bitch shut up" , what I told her
When she saw the ocean view
Man I swear she lost all her Controlla

[Hook]
Two-piece in a two-seater
Double cup, need a two liter
I'm about to hit twice, yeah
I'ma call that a two-peater
Roll two blunts, two reefers
All I need is about two beepers
Hit me up when you need that

[Verse 2: Smif & Wesson]
Yeah, look
All I know is commas, commas
I can fit the burner in my palm-a
Twistin the, twistin the Dalai Lama
(Sheesh)
My bitch wicked, wicked, wicked
Ass and titties cost a ticket
She said she gott that finger lickin'
(Ha, yuh)
I'm talkin' greasy, Church's Chicken
Get her out the Vicky, she a victim
Put that good D all up in her system
I love when she make it wobble
I love when her head go bobble
I feel like I won the lotto

[Hook: Jeremih]
Two-piece in a two-seater
Double cup, need a two liter
I'm about to hit twice, yeah
I'ma call that a two-peater
Roll two blunts, two reefers
All I need is about two beepers
Hit me up when you need that

[Outro: Jeremih]
I'm 'bout 30, 'bout to lead now
I'm about it if you with that
I got that serve it out the alley
She threw it back, I lost my balance
I work it up, got that work
Mr. Late Nights call me Fallon
Light skin but taste chocolate
Oh you got that Fannie Mae
