[Hook: Jeremih & Red Cafe]
Hey girl, let me tell you a little story 'bout this thing called fuckin'
Hey girl, let me tell you a little story 'bout this thing called fuckin'
Lay you on your back
Got your legs in the air like a peace sign
Lay you on your back
Got your legs wide open like a peace sign
We can make it nasty
I know you love to get nasty
I be countin' this money
You can get freaky while I'm rollin' my Cali

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Yeah, I only compare you to your reflection
Let's say this thing we got be on textin'
Any time of day, strip off your lingerie
I'm a real nigga, its a real nigga holiday
I know its juicy as fuck I done heard 'bout you
Turn niggas to stalkers, I done heard 'bout you
Have you bussin' like a chopper, la la la
Used to be mellow when I was off the lala
You taste like a peach, what you told me
And you should get the sweetie pie trophy
If it's sticky I need more than a quickie
Round 1, round 2, I'm strippin' you out them Vickies, ah!

[Hook: Jeremih & Red Cafe]
Hey girl, let me tell you a little story 'bout this thing called fuckin'
Hey girl, let me tell you a little story 'bout this thing called fuckin'
Lay you on your back
Got your legs in the air like a peace sign
Lay you on your back
Got your legs wide open like a peace sign
We can make it nasty
I know you love to get nasty
I be countin' this money
You can get freaky while I'm rollin' my Cali

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Fornication in the fountain blue
4 or 5 of them bitches couldn't amount to you
I could spend it all, then spend a night with you
But I got too much of it, I'm just a flight away
She a baller, we both shopping for the same brands
Bail hard but they all call up 'bout her first name
I'ma change the bitch last name
Don't wanna hear stories about your last lame (nah)
We sippin' syrup in the fast lane
Wide-body Phantom, lower miles than your prom date
I seen a brick in the 9th grade
Swerve up on a bitch and I might say (Maybach Music), ugh

[Hook: Jeremih & Red Cafe]
Hey girl, let me tell you a little story 'bout this thing called fuckin'
Hey girl, let me tell you a little story 'bout this thing called fuckin'
Lay you on your back
Got your legs in the air like a peace sign
Lay you on your back
Got your legs wide open like a peace sign
We can make it nasty
I know you love to get nasty
I be countin' this money
You can get freaky while you rollin' my Cali

[Outro: Jeremih]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey girl, hey girl
Lay you on your back
Got your legs in the air like a peace sign
Lay you on your back
Got your legs wide open like a peace sign
