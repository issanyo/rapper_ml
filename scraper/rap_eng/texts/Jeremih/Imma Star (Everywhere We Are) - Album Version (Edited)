I thought I told yah... I'm a star
You see the ice... You see the cars
Flashy lights... Everywhere we are
Livin like... Like there's no tomorrow

I thought I told yah... I'm a star
You see the ice... You see the cars
Flashy lights... Everywhere we are
Livin like... Like there's no tomorrow

Ooh ooh oohhh

I got money... I don't need a range
I'm a pimp... I don't need a cane
Big bills Charlie... You could keep the change
Now that I got the torch... I'm a keep the flame
I'm a keep my aim... Gotta make the big shots
In my linen suit... Louis V flip flops
Got a bad bitch... Her hair & nails tip top
Jeremih got the game on a slip knot
Just to fold the stacks... I got rubber bands
Consumers only want you to supply demand
So here I am... Check my DNA
Getting money's the only thing on my resum√©

I thought I told yah... I'm a star
You see the ice... You see the cars
Flashy lights... Everywhere we are
Livin life... Like there's no tomorrow

Ooh ooh oohhh

I thought I told yah... I'm a star
You see the ice... You see the cars
Flashy lights... Everywhere we are
Livin like... Like there's no tomorrow
Ooh ooh oohhh

Like the dealer ship, I got boo-coo cars
Penitentiary... I keep boo-coo bars
Flow so hot... Fried in boo-coo lard
Hollywood ground, I got boo-coo stars
Don't need Roger Ebert or the paparazzi
Take more than the red octagon to stop me
I hit hella licks. Man, hella stagin
Hit the weed man... just to get in touch with Mary Jane
You're a Scorpio?... Girl get over here
Ride me all night... Like you kin of Paul Revere
Kissing on my neck... Nibbling on my ear
You say you wanna chill... Go ahead & have a beer

I thought I told yah... I'm a star
You see the ice... You see the cars
Flashy lights... Everywhere we are
Livin like... Like there's no tomorrow

Ooh ooh oohhh

I thought I told yah... I'm a star
You see the ice... You see the cars
Flashy lights... Everywhere we are
Livin like... Like there's no tomorrow

Ooh ooh oohhh

Now if you back it up, shawty I'ma stack it up
If you back it up, shawty I'ma smack it up
I'ma stack it up, but only if you back it up (Oh!)

Ooh, Ay-ay

(Lights) ooh

Everywhere we are (ooh oh ooo)
Everywhere we are (ooh oh ooo)
Flashy Lights, (ooh ooh) lights (ooh) lights, (ooh ooh Oh!)
Everywhere we are (ooh oh ooo)

Oh OoO Okay. Now I be ballin'
I. I. I be. I be ballin'
You can catch me in the air. air
I be Rawlins
When I'm tryna grab some gear. gear...
I be mallin'
In the middle of the club...
With 1 dolla u call its
Either the camera's cliasascaasking
Or the Police Clockinu
Especially at the end of the month
When it's just not an option
Now they got that spotlight on me
Why they put that on me
Now I'm never lonely
'Cause everywhere I go it's...
