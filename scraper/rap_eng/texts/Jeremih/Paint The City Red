[Verse 1]
You fine as hell, I'm handsome too
Got your dress and heels on, I rock my suit
I got the flyest cars, and you be in 'em
You don't date losers, girl, you rollin' with a winner
And we gon' paint the city red tonight
We should paint the city red tonight
Lets paint the city red tonight

[Chorus]
Got the purple whip, it match your lipstick
Hot chick, kisses from my Vixen
Don't you stop, don't you stop mixin'
Devil in a dress, the baddest bitch
We gon' paint the city red tonight
We paint the city red tonight

[Verse 2]
Same 'bout the Nike, or [?]
You want that Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, or how 'bout Louis?
Soon we'll we be runnin' out of stop signs, it ain't no stoppin'
I wanna boom-boom-bang it like a gun, and you my target
My red beam's on you, private party after 2, yea

[Chorus]
Got the purple whip, it match your lipstick
Hot chick, kisses from my Vixen
Don't you stop, don't you stop mixin'
Devil in a dress, the baddest bitch
We gon' paint the city red tonight
We paint the city red tonight
