[Verse 1]
What's the use in buyin' that new coupe
When you ridin' 'round by yourself?
What's the use in buyin' that big crib
When ain't no one 'round to help?
When I show up, I'ma show out
I'ma turn up when you show me that
Baby hold up, won't you hold up
Go crazy, don't hold it back
I like to play crazy sometimes
Forward headed, dreams to the stars
How you stay freaky 'til the sun up?
How you, baby? Stronger

[Chorus]
Actin' up, actin' up
We be actin' up, she be actin' up
I be actin' up when the ash is up
We actin' up, and that's enough
Actin' up, I be actin' up
She be actin' up, commas, we be actin' up
Baby, actin' up, just actin' up
We actin' up, that's enough

[Verse 2]
Got a little bitch from the east side
Got it goin' on on the west
And I'm strong all in my legs
All that weed, body sweat
I'ma treat you so special
All I need to hear is, "Yes"
Know I got you fuckin' with the best side
You ain't gotta keep it on the inside
Girl when your 'bout it
I know it's over
People around and
You be like, "So what?"
All the cameras on you cause you

[Chorus]
Actin' up, she be actin' up
I be actin' up, actin' up
We be actin' us, they be actin' us
Cause we actin' up, that's enough
Ass is up, I be smackin' up
We be smacked enough off that Jack and her
They be actin' us, they be actin' us
We actin' up

Best, do it the best
Baby I'm professional
Girl don't hit me unless
You all on me undressed
Why am I the only one dressed?
Come on, show less
Then we'll have to leave another mess
Wonder why the pussy so wet
Why my sheets always be a mess
Please tell me when we gon' sesh
I'll apply the right amount of pressure
You ain't pulled up on me in a long time
Hope you ain't doin' nothin' else
Know that you be out here actin' so shy
But why you always shake when I caress you?
Don't need no cameras, turn off the lights
With the action, we be

[Chorus]
Actin' up, she be actin' up
I be actin' up, actin' up
We be actin' us, they be actin' us
Cause we actin' up, that's enough
Ass is up, I be smackin' up
We be smacked enough off that Jack and her
They be actin' us, they be actin' us
We actin' up, actin'
