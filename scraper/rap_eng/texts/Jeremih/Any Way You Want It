[Bridge: Jeremih]
I think I think I love it (She get)
Naked when it's nothing
Wake up in the morning
Bet it won't feel like
It's just another morning

[Hook: Jeremih]
Let me make it better
Bet you won't forget it
Take all the money
Any way you want it

[Verse 1: Harvey Stripes]
I can't even lie
My new bitch – my partner in crime
Her lips, eyes, hips, thighs
'Bout as hot as a gasoline fire
Might bend her over like a center-fold
Hugh Hefner magazine style
She collect my dough and I send her home
With twenty stands of them fives
I can't even lie
We're the modern Bonnie & Clyde
Her cocaine colored nine-eleven
Match my Panamera all white
She turnt up, aquafina
With a little molly inside
Ménage a trois with the hottest broads
We should call it quality time
Still money over these bitches
Plenty all in the swishas
I’m percalizing that pussy
Cut it so deep she need stitches
Ball mean, I'm a broad dream for Alexander McQueen
Yeah, even my bitch ball, that's WNBA

[Verse 2: Harvey Stripes]
I can't even lie
I'm the king so crown me tonight
Where the turk and cake goes to Bora Bora
First class wherever we fly
She my main bitch, got a mistress
She don't mind my thing on the side
Vea stones on her pinkie ring
And she ain't even my wife
I can't even lie
Rolling off a pill
She's the Energyzer bunny
Duffelbag girl, got Fendi on her luggage
Keep it all real even though I'm stacking up my money
Need I say more? The estates and the whips is paid for
Why you think she tattooed my name for?
Shine 'ause we grind, no skateboard
Say "fuck 'em other niggas"
She say "fuck 'em other bitches"
Cause she down for a nigga like Michelle Obama
Ride or die bitch, Griselda Blanco
Mickey and Mallory type, connected, family ties
We ride together, die together, yeah can't even lie

[Bridge]
