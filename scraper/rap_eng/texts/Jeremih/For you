(Verse 1)
Dirty cup of H-town take a sip babe
Only you that I'm thinking on a day the day
All my life yeah it's always been fuck you pay me
Diamonds dancing on my wrist like Lisa Raye

Players club now we ballin' how we posed to
Graduated to the rari, kept the old school
I done ran through my bank but girl that's old news
Fucking on the pool table all we broke was rules
Yeah!


(Pre-Chorus)
Her body language no discussion
Way she move like she fucking
Backwoods full of musty
Big pockets you can't touch this
She a bad girl my Rih Rih
I'm a bad boy like Puffy
She the business and I mind my business
Keep my mind on you babe like it's nothing yeah

(Chorus)
I guess I'm for you baby
I'm going to love you lady
Showed you I'm different
Don't you act distant
Forever I'm ready yeah

I got something for you baby
I'm going to love you lady
Showed I'm different
So don't you act distant
Forever I'm ready yeah

(Verse 2)
Knockin' boots up in the truck
Why we always turnin' up?
She had me on that first look
I don't think I'd call this love

Why every time we get up
Doggy style make her call me daddy
This ain't puppy love

Pick a plane we can trip
I got it, it ain't trickin'
Plenty champagne to sip
Diving in lets skinny dip

Know ya down to play some games
Girl ya with it
Kiss it on the plane baby
That's a real trip yeah

(Pre-Chorus)
Her body language no discussion
Way she move like she fucking
Backwoods full of musty
Big pockets you can't touch this
She a bad girl my Rih Rih
I'm a bad boy like Puffy
She the business and I mind my business
Keep my mind on you babe like it's nothing yeah

(Chorus)
I guess I'm for you baby
I'm going to love you lady
Showed you I'm different
Don't you act distant
Forever I'm ready yeah

I got something for you baby
I'm going to love you lady
Showed I'm different
So don't you act distant
Forever I'm ready yeah
