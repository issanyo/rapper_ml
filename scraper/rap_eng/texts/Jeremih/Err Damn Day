[Intro]
Turn up, roll up, burn up
Turn up

[Hook 1]
Still smokin' that la la la –
'Bout to head out to East LA
I hope I don't miss my flight
Got a show out in Saint-Tropez
I be kickin' it in the red light district
Where some hoes speak Français
Shoutout to the thick girls in Houston, Chi-Town, and M.I.A
I be smokin' on that la la la
'Bout to head out to East LA
I hope I don't miss my flight
Got a show out in Saint-Tropez
I be kickin' it in the red light district
Where some hoes speak Français
Shoutout to the thick girls in Houston, Chi-Town, and M.I.A
I be on that la la la, like e'ry damn day
La la la like e'ry damn day x3

[Verse 1]
Aye look, I'm gone off the molly – I'm gone out this world
I'm buyin' all my liquor, and I keep thinkin' 'bout my girl
I'm out in West LA, my bitch from West LA
Yeah she talk all night, but she fuck all day
We on that la la la, we just landed in the Bay
From San Fran to Oakland, they smoke all day
And then we fly down south, to ATL
And M-I-A-yayo, I'm probably with your girl
Then head to NYC, did a show with SOB
Interviews on MTV, yeah it's just me and Travy

[Bridge]
Roll up and pass it, this another classic x4

[Hook 2]
I'm on that la la la – 'bout to head out to East LA
I hope I don't miss my flight, got a show out in Saint-Tropez
I be kickin' it in the red light district where some hoes speak Français
Shoutout to the thick girls in Houston, Chi-Town, and M.I.A
I be on that la la la, like e'ry damn day
La la la like e'ry damn day x3

[Verse 2]
Black boe, black boe though
Three deep, but we came in a four-door
Had to stalk through the hood on the low-low
Stepped out, niggas smellin' like dough-dough
Hit a dice game, rollin' on the floor, ho
First roll, nigga, three pimps, four hoes
Nigga, put your money on the floor
My nigga Three keep the dro rolled
Like err damn day, my weed from West LA
But I got it from MLK
That's Atlanta, ho – I'm from Kamero
Probably catch me at the crib with a centerfold
And I still pop sills if you didn't know
Oh man, I'm a player, God
On the track with my homeboy Jeremih
Heat on with the top down
Man, it's pretty cold in the Chi-Town
This ain't no motherfucking Newport
But we headed to the airport

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3]
Smokin' on that la la, top down, I'm sky high
Diamonds bright when the sun shine
The girl is yours but the pussy's mine
Me and two mamacitas in the back of the truck
Smokin' on keesha while they backin' it up
Been gettin' money, throw a stack in the club
Know a nigga still hood, got a strap in the tuck
My bitch is immaculate, more money, I have to get
200 on the dash, no holdin' back, boy, I'm smashin' it
Got a bitch from the H-Town, big booty, smoked my whole pound
All the dope boys want shorty, I can't even bring her around
If you want to, we can ride away
Get high today and throw some bands away
Got a show tonight in Saint-Tropez
I poured a four and just copped an eighth

[Hook 1]
