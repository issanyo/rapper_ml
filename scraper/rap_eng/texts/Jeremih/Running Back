[Verse 1 : Keith James]
My flight is taking off, 3:45
If there’s a storm girl I’ll make it to you
I’d drive 10 thousand miles
Or fly this plane myself
They’ll be no golden rings, no turtle doves
No reason if I can’t make it to you girl
My heart would break so bad, If you had no one there

[Hook : Keith James]
From the west or the east coast
To my chest in the deep snow
Running back to my baby (I’ll be)
Running back to my baby
The weather man say it's all bad
You can miss me with all that
Running back to my baby (I’ll be)
Running back to my baby
I could just grow wings and fly
Soaring through unfriendly skies
Nothing now I wouldn’t try
Running back to my baby (I’ll be)
Running back to my baby

[Verse 2 : Jeremih]
Tryna rent a car, I'm here in line
Skimming pictures of memories past us by
Got every Christmas baby, can’t let this one die (No, no, no, no)
I’ve got this sicken feeling, I just can’t fight no
Until you're hearing me whispering I’m glad you're mine
I said I'd make it here, no matter rain or shine
And I came running for my baby

[Hook : Keith James & Jeremih]
From the west or the east coast
To my chest in the deep snow
Running back to my baby (I’ll be)
Running back to my baby
Weather man said it's all bad
He can miss me with all that
Running back to my baby (I’ll be)
Running back to my baby
I could just grow wings and fly
Soaring through unfriendly skies
Nothing now I wouldn’t try
Running back to my baby (I’ll be)
Running back to my baby

[Bridge : Keith James]
Oh you know you got me running back here
Running back baby
Oh your lovin' got me running back here
Running back baby
Oh my baby got me running back here
Running back baby
Oh you know you got me running back here

[Hook : Keith James]
From the west or the east coast
To my chest in the deep snow
Running back to my baby (I’ll be)
Running back to my baby
The weather man say it's all bad
You can miss me with all that
Running back to my baby (I’ll be)
Running back to my baby
I could just grow wings and fly
Soaring through unfriendly skies
Nothing now I wouldn’t try
Running back to my baby (I’ll be)
Running back to my baby
