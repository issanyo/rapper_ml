[Intro: PND]
Oooh-hooo-hooo
PX
Yeah
FÃ©rina

[Hook: PND & Jeremih]
Don't say that you love me
If you don't love me
Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't play
I'm in the club one time for you
Time for you
Hit this blow one time for you
Two shots and I tip them two times for you (Two times, three times)
Fears tell, slide in Range Rovers
This for the freaks that's sleeping over

[Verse 1: PND]
All of my rapper friends came with the rapper bitches
I [?] came with them other bitches
[?] sit with the pad and pen
King, king, king, king, boom
Bone in the Mase', boning
All this shade, this bitch a ghost
[?] too rude
Oooh, oooh

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Don't tell me you love me
If you don't love me
Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't play
Don't tell me you love me
If you don't love me
Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't play

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Diamonds in the rollie, I can tell the time in it
I just copped a crib and I ain't spent no time in it
All these hoes be choosin', I'm just mindin' my business
Got to keep it brief, the case is always closed, winnin'
Jesus piece cost 70 and Lord is my witness
35 just for the coat and 5 for my vision
I can't trust these hoes no more than I can trust these niggas
Niggas like hydraulics in the caddie, they be switchin'
3 plus 3, you know my money comin' in 6 digits
Bread on bread, but I ain't got nothin' for a pigeon

[Break]
*whistling*

[Hook: PND & Jeremih]
Don't say, don't play
I'm in the club one time for you
Time for you
Hit this blow one time for you
Two shots and I tip them two times for you (Two times, three times)
Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't play

[Outro: Jeremih]
Don't tell me you love me
If you don't love me
Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't play
