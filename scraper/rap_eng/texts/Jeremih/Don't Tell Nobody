Baby don't tell nobody
Yeah i know what your saying is the truth
Baby don't tell nobody, No
Don't front me off in front of company
You know we could work that out
Maybe we should work that
Maybe we should work that out
You know we could work that
Baby don't tell nobody
Don't front me off in front of company

I just text yo like 30 something times in a row
You ain't gotta lie
Cause its going on 5
And if you ain't in my bed
Then you laying with a ho
So fuck that love shit
I don't feel none of that
Like i'm numd to the pain
Said i'm done with a game
But i'm still here running back
Cause I already know your lingo
You talk to these hoes like you're single
You know you really love pulling fast ones
Cheat, Come home and act dumb
Pussy nigga, pussy nigga
Listen nigga i see's ya
Even when you ain't in sight
I just hold it in like its pitching time
Ive been holding back for a long while
Just hoping soon it'll turn around but
How can i word this
You ain't been perfect
Tell me you working it
Your phone losing service
And now i'm here thinking
Like 'This nigga tweakin"
You sorry, pathetic and far from authentic
You liar , You fronter
You just like these other niggas
As much as i hate you, I still wanna date you
You better just hope i don't

Sick of this keep it on the DL shit
You say you with the bros when you out with a bitch
You say you at the crib when you leaving her place
I pull up to ya crib and you lie to my face
He like 'Baby you my all and all, I was in the bathroom when i missed ya call'
Nah you was in the backseat sweating like a athlete doing everything that you said you wouldn't
But I ain't gonna trip on a weak ass nigga
Ima just find me a nigga much bigger
Ima just do the same shit that you do when i'm not up in the room
Yea baby lets think
Imma text Bryan, Facetime Ryan, Call up Keenan tell em i need him
Niggas ain't loyal, and i knew from the jump when you showed me the ropes
I wouldn't  never have trust for you
You creeping, i'm leaving
You call me,I pick up
I hang up, you text me
Lets link up
Then i just say fuck it then we end up fucking and you start something
I said I was done with
Then it all repeats in the next 2 weeks ill be back on the same i'm done shit
If they only knew that i'd rather be loose
Man i'm tempted nut i ain't gonna......

Oh Ooohhh
When i'm right there the night gets better
Oh ooohh
You must admit we want together
Cause you don't talk that shit when i give you gas money

Good weed good dick
Girl you get it all from me
Plenty secrets of you and your world
Even me and you and your girls
That I would never tell nobody
