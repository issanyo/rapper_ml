[Intro]
Give it to 'em
Give it to 'em
Give it to 'em
Give it to 'em
Give it to 'em
Give it to 'em
Give it to 'em

[Verse 1]
Don't do much talkin', I just chuck 'em with the D
Got 'bout three-four bad-bad bitches in the tub waiting for me
Oh, my favorite so damn cold, her name Elise
Say she got a man but she can't stand that he's a ze-ro
But I'm the man, I'll have her believe
Bet she catch her hands, all-all over me
Gon' roll up a leaf
Take you to the NASA, be careful what you ask for

[Bridge]
I know they want that (Give it to 'em)
Whatever's on tap (Give it to 'em)
I'ma spend a little more change at the bar, tell the DJ to run this back (Give it to 'em)
I give it to 'em, give it to 'em, give it to 'em
Give it to 'em, give it to 'em, give it to 'em
Give it to 'em, give it to 'em, give it to 'em
Give it to 'em, give it to 'em, give it to 'em

[Hook]
Jeremih got the shit that'll make the (Girls go wild, girls go wild)
And you can have it like this when you make your (Girls go wild, girls go wild)
Who would've thought I'd be a hit when I made my (Girls go wild, girls go wild)
And you can talk your shit when you make your (Girls go wild, girls go wild)

[Verse 2]
Fresh up out that chop shop, CLK Mercedes
Why they say your girl be wildin' out when she ain't 'round her baby?
You wonder why? I can get her wetter
She want to be a freak? Why wouldn't I let her?
You know what to do - I, I just do it better
She said she want the D, well, no offense
Man, I swear she make it stop and then go
Swear that thing so swole
Booty sock and boppin' her head, she sweatin' out them clothes
I just want to see her comfortable
But I ain't tryin' to treat her comfort, though
Now she only want to see me off Patron
'Cause her man'll never get her off at home

[Bridge]
I know they want that (Give it to 'em)
Whatever's on tap (Give it to 'em)
I'ma spend a little more change at the bar, tell the DJ to run this back (Give it to 'em)
I give it to 'em, give it to 'em, give it to 'em
Give it to 'em, give it to 'em, give it to 'em
Give it to 'em, give it to 'em, give it to 'em
Give it to 'em, give it to 'em, give it to 'em
