[Intro: Jeremih (Kid Ink)]
I'm trynna leave with somebody (You 'bout it, uh-huh)
I love the way that you move (What you doing, keep going)
I got all these hoes on me (They choosing, aw yeah)
All I want is you (You know how it go!)
Mustard on the beat, ho!

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I'm trynna leave when you wanna
The car outside straight out Daytona
Just take it easy on marijuana
Cuz I'mma need you up, ain't no sleeping 'till the morning girl
We goin' the rounds like Mayweather
Swear you looking like Aaliyah, 4 page letter
And you lookin' at a pot of gold
Runnin' my city like it's cardio, I do
Tell her, bring it back show me that it's working
Drop to your knees like worship
You know how the story goes, hoes be hoes
Don't let 'em make you mad
The minute I'mma take you back
Turn that ass 'round, break your back
Gotta good girl high, I'm breaking bad
Hit corners to the crib like the breaks is bad, oh!

[Hook: Jeremih]
I'm trynna leave with somebody, I love the way that you move
I got all these hoes on me, all I want is you
Go and back it up on me
Can't help everytime you come around, I take you down
Girl we go for rounds
Girl we go, girl we go, girl we go for rounds
G-Girl we go, girl we go, girl we go for rounds

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Let's get it!
I come for rounds when I come around
And I don't fuck around with them fuck arounds
Now bring yo ass around let yo ass round
All these Audemars round, order more rounds
Throw it back, get your shot, throw it back
You throw it at me, I'mma throw it back
Playin' catch, go get it, we playin' fetch (get it girl)
I'm naughty by nature shout out to Treach Yea
Yea, I'm now an OP-P
I got too much dick, I got that OD-D
I got that OG-G
And you know I brought some dough with me (shit)
Even your girls want you to flow with me
And bitches be hating cuz they alone
Talking about but who gonna take me home
But you deserve rounds you deserve rounds
Told the bitches in the way had to swerve around

[Hook: Jeremih]
I'm trynna leave with somebody, I love the way that you move
I got all these hoes on me, all I want is you
Go and back it up on me
Can't help everytime you come around, take it down
Girl we do it for rounds
Girl we do it, girl we do it, girl we do it for rounds
G-Girl we do it, girl we do it, girl we do it for rounds

[Outro: Jeremih]
I'm trynna leave with somebody, I love the way that you move
I got all these hoes on me, all I want is you
Go and back it up on me
Can't help everytime you come around, take it down
Girl we do it for rounds
