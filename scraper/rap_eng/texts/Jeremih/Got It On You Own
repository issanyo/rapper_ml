[Verse 1: Julian]
Now she looking for a friend, now she looking for a lover
Now she talking to her dad, now she fighting with the mother
Now she wanna move away, different back on different colour
Now she wanna do her thang, but she hiding undercover
She got things she'll never say, put her feelings in a cupboard
She's scared of being judged but I'll bail you out forever
Now she's smarter than she knows and she knows she could do better
Now she's talking to herself 'cause no one understands her better

[Pre-Chorus: Julian]
And I know you wanna show 'em, you won't stop
I know you wanna be the one to pull up to the lot
I know you wanna be the one to show 'em what you got
I know you wanna be the one to show 'em that you hot
And I already know

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Girl, you know you got it on your own
Got a hundred in your pocket and a hundred on the floor
Baby, you ain't gotta do this anymore
And you ain't gotta prove nobody, they already know
Girl, you know you got it on your own
Got a hundred in your pocket and a hundred on the floor
Baby, you ain't gotta do this anymore
And you ain't gotta prove nobody, they already know

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Oh you got it, who said you not it
You're about the green , talking Henny
[??] hipnotic, we're making movies
Hit the scene, the box office
It's Abu Dhabi, heat it up
Cooling off, I'm wrist watching, anal baby
Giuseppe walking, only [??] talking
Throw it back, I'll catch you falling
Screaming "Papi [??]", I'm no papi
You give me life, you make me a wife
For the night, I double tap it, you're here for life

[Pre-Chorus: Julian]
I know you wanna show 'em, you won't stop
I know you wanna be the one to pull up to the lot
I know you wanna be the one to show 'em what you got
I know you wanna be the one to show 'em that you hot
And I already know

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Girl, you know you got it on your own
Got a hundred in your pocket and a hundred on the floor
Baby, you ain't gotta do this anymore
And you ain't gotta prove nobody, they already know
Girl, you know you got it on your own
Got a hundred in your pocket and a hundred on the floor
Baby, you ain't gotta do this anymore
And you ain't gotta prove nobody, they already know

[Bridge: Julian]
They already know
I know you wanna show 'em, you won't stop
I know you wanna be the one to pull up to the lot
I know you wanna be the one to show 'em what you got
I know you wanna be the one to show 'em that you hot

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Girl, you know you got it on your own
Got a hundred in your pocket and a hundred on the floor
Baby, you ain't gotta do this anymore
And you ain't gotta prove nobody, they already know
