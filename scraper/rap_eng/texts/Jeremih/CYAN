[Intro: Quentin Miller]
Hey, I like, blue on green
Hey, hey

[Chorus: Quentin Miller]
Blue on green, blue on green, blue on green
I'm in love, drunk in love, Jay and Bey
Pop the trunk wherever it be
Back and front, blue on green, blue on green

Hey, blue on green, blue on green, blue on green (ay)
I'm in love, drunk in love, Jay and Bey (ay)
Pop the trunk wherever it be
Back and front, hey, huh

[Verse 1]
1317 (are you ready?)
That's the team, more like a machine (are you ready?), huh, huh
That's on everything, whoa
That's on everything, we want everything (you know)
We want everything, even them extra things
Found myself away and took advantage of that
Niggas tell their perspective end up bendin' the facts
Hol' up, hol' up, roll up, relax
We do, we do big drugs then quit then relapse (yeah)
Word is he snapped (are you ready?), he do
Ain't it the truth, ain't in the truth, true (are you ready?)
Goin' with any of you (are you ready)
Any of you, any of you's (are you ready?)

[Chorus: Quentin Miller]
Blue on green, blue on green, blue on green
I'm in love, drunk in love, Jay and Bey
Pop the trunk, wherever it may be
Back and front, blue on green, blue on green

Hey, blue on green, blue on green, blue on green
I'm in love, drunk in love, Jay and Bey
Pop the trunk, pop the trunk with me (trunk with me)
Back and front (my dawg), back and front, hey

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Blue on green, blue on green
[?] for Jay and Bey
All I knew was Rosa, Jay and B's
What we on? Fuck you mean?
You ain't [?], still we OG on creatine
Blowin' strong, pass it to [some tings]
Down for shit so shotguns
We do it 'till the team's pockets full of Benjamins
I call 'em B. B. Kings we would be some hot boys
Since they say bling-bling, every hook at throw at 'em (are you ready?)
[?] look green
Big diamonds, blue stream (are you ready?)
[?] is all I see

[Chorus: Quentin Miller]
Blue on green, blue on green, blue on green
I'm in love, drunk in love, Jay and Bey (yeah, yeah)
Pop the trunk, whatever it may be (top off)
Back and front, blue on green, blue on green (are you ready?)

Hey, blue on green, blue on green, blue on green  (are you ready?)
I'm in love, drunk in love, Jay and Bey  (are you ready?)
Pop the trunk, pop the trunk with me (trunk with me)
Back and front (my dawg), back and front, hey

[Outro: Quentin Miller]
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
