[Hook: Jeremih, Kid Ink, & Gorilla Zoe]
Put

Put yo head down

Talkin' bout fresh

Cash up
Let it hit the ground
Cash up, head down
Cash up, head down
Cash up, head down
Talkin' bout fresh
Where they at now

[Post-Hook: Jeremih]
Know I hit the mall today
New Balenciagas, bought em' all today
Then my phone rang
Gotta come away
To get a couple bands and blow it all away

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
I'm puttin'
Cash up, nigga that's us
Money on my mind
See the caption
Champagne campaign in my election
Ball so hard, bout to get ejected
Shades on, hidin' from the limelight
Blind side, lookin' at her back side
Get yo ass left if
You don't act right
I can see them squats got yo ass tight
Uh, just throw it all my way
And you gone get some money for the mall today
I swear niggas thought they was bossin' up
Dog you don't know the alley that you barkin' up
