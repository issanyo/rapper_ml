[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Last night I had two bitches

Something sexy 'bout them pretty keep it hood bitches
They just seem to show me what I'm feeling
Let your body see, I said she freakin' to me

Now everybody see, she is the freak of the week
You got your body speaking to me

[Verse 2: Krept]
Step, step, step to the party like a OG
Party jumping, neighbours can't go sleep
Now the neighbours tryna call the police

Say you a freak, show me how freaky
And she got moves like bad gyal RiRi

Get naughty, get naughty

[Verse 4: Konan]
Say you got a man, you don't seem sure
Showing off your skin, I wanna see more

Have you ever ate McDonald's on a G4?
You got your keys to my beamer, beep beep
