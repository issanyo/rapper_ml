[Intro]
I don't know what you're feeling
I don't know what you're making
Can we talk 'bout believing?
Or did this happen for nothing?
And oh, no
We're so close, oh

I don't know what you're feeling
I don't know what you're making
Can we talk 'bout believing?
Or did this happen for nothing?
And oh, no
We're so close, oh

[Hook]
Hold me closer, keep me safe
Now I told you love don't change
Think of me forever this way
Love me baby
Keep me baby
Hold me baby
Keep me safe, yeah

I know my loyalty you're waiting on
It's because of who we are
You hear love

[Verse 1]
Know your city that you're used to
Know I ain't exactly what you're used to
What you supposed to do?
I don't blame you
What you supposed to do?

Know you're prolly worried
What I am used to
Impatient, impatient
Impatient, I'm waiting

[Hook]
Hold me closer, keep me safe
Now I told you love don't change
Think of me forever this way
Love me baby
Keep me baby
Hold me baby
Keep me safe, yeah

I know my loyalty you're waiting on
It's because of who we are
You hear love

[Pre-Hook]
Now you got me thinking 'bout you
All night
Me and you
Seemed like it would be alright
Long as we can keep it
All night
All night

[Outro]
I don't know what you're feeling
I don't know what you're making
Can we talk 'bout believing?
Or did this happen for nothing?
And oh, no
We're so close, oh

I don't know what you're feeling
I don't know what you're making
Can we talk 'bout believing?
Or did this happen for nothing?
And oh, no
We're so close, oh
