[Intro: Brooke Hogan & (Fabolous)]
You know what today is?
(Of course I know what today is, it's your birthday, I bought you a gift)
What?
(Me, look what I got you)
Oh my god can I have it

[Fabolous]
My shawty called me like you know it's bout to come (come come come)
I said your friend shit let me come get some (some some some)
She said your stupid boy I'm talkin bout my birthday (day day day)
I need some good dick in the worst way (way way way)
Its going down, No hesitation
Its time to eat, pussy reservations
Them chocolate lips got me wanting Hersey kisses
Come blow my candle girl, then make your birthday wishes

[Brooke]
It's my birthday, so you know you want to hide out
Wanna stay inside with you even if its at my house
Sip that southern boy dont spill it on my couch
I feel good but I want you to make me cry out
You know I want action so boy get ready
I want pleasure and passion we building steady
Your so in to giving and so profounded
I'll tell you where to put your gift boy
Boy you know I-I-I, Boy you know I-I-I
I've been screaming caught up in the late night
I'm dreaming about you in me
Boy you know I-I-I, Boy you know I-I-I
I don't need candles and cake
Just need your frosting on me
Birthday sex

Feel the tension pull my shirt over my head
Get on me and now we begin
Boy I won't give up I love the state I'm in
You almost lose it when I back begins to bend
We grinding with passion cuz its my birthday
I want satisfaction so please don't hurt me
You love me so sweetly so please dont hurt me
I'll tell you how I want my gift boy

Boy you know I-I-I, Boy you know I-I-I
I've been screaming caught up in the late night
I'm dreaming about you in me
Boy you know I-I-I, Boy you know I-I-I
I dont need candles and cake
Just need your frosting on me
Birthday sex

Don't stop give it to me
Don't stop give it to me
Don't stop give it to me
Don't stop give it to me

Boy you know I-I-I, Boy you know I-I-I
I've been screaming caught up in the late night
I'm dreaming about you in me
Boy you know I-I-I, Boy you know I-I-I
I dont need candles and cake
