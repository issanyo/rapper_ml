[Intro: French Montana]
Funkmaster Flex night
Funkmaster Flex night
Funkmaster Flex night
Funkmaster Flex night
Funkmaster Flex night
Don't panic, nigga, don't panic (ha)
Don't panic, nigga, don't panic (ha)
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Chorus: French Montana]
Shawty fell in love with a hustler
Man, I took her from a buster
Niggas keep talking like they know something
I slide on your bitch like she on something
Don't panic, don't panic, we just getting started, nigga, don't panic
Real niggas getting cake, watch the fake niggas hate
Don't panic, don't panic, we just getting started, nigga, don't panic
Don't panic, don't panic, we just getting started, nigga, don't panic

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Look, haha, okay, don't panic, I see you poppin' that pussy
I'm tryna lick on the cookie, I'm eatin' through the panties
In and out that booty, ham sandwich
Young, new killer, bitch, your nigga old like BlackPlanet
Strapped up, pistol with the bandanas
Extended clip, gotta hide it from the damn cameras
Man, I'm only smokin' Cali kush
When I'm on the plane, they got your bitch rollin' the blunts, I call it high standards
Chucks with my Locs on
Pretty girls, tell 'em ugly bitches, "Go home"
You know, they comin' for the money and the real niggas
You know, these thirsty ass thots need a meal ticket, ha!

[Chorus: French Montana]
Shawty fell in love with a hustler
Man, I took her from a buster
Niggas keep talking like they know something
I slide on your bitch like she on something
Don't panic, don't panic, we just getting started, nigga, don't panic
Real niggas getting cake, watch the fake niggas hate
Don't panic, don't panic, we just getting started, nigga, don't panic
Don't panic, don't panic, we just getting started, nigga, don't panic

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Talkin' fish scales like a whole salmon
See you fuck niggas from four planets
Just gettin' started, nigga, don't panic
If you a star, I'm a whole planet
Acting like she won't get it
Have her run through the team like Jerome Bettis
You don't want it, don't look for it
Have your bitch on a surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
If you want this money, gotta work for it
Puff puff pass, what you lookin' at?
Bust it wide open, make it nasty

[Chorus: French Montana]
Shawty fell in love with a hustler
Man, I took her from a buster
Niggas keep talking like they know something
I slide on your bitch like she on something
Don't panic, don't panic, we just getting started, nigga, don't panic
Real niggas getting cake, watch the fake niggas hate
Don't panic, don't panic, we just getting started, nigga, don't panic
Don't panic, don't panic, we just getting started, nigga, don't panic

[Bridge: French Montana]
Don't panic, nigga, don't panic
Don't panic, nigga, don't panic

[Chorus: French Montana]
Shawty fell in love with a hustler
Man, I took her from a buster
Niggas keep talking like they know something
I slide on your bitch like she on something
Don't panic, don't panic, we just getting started, nigga, don't panic
Real niggas getting cake, watch the fake niggas hate
Don't panic, don't panic, we just getting started, nigga, don't panic
Don't panic, don't panic, we just getting started, nigga, don't panic
