[Intro]
Yeah, Mustard on the beat ho

[Verse 1: Nelly]
Shawty hit me on the late night
Got a man, got me thinkin', shawty, ainâ€™t right
She say she ain't about the creep life
But all she wanna do is take pipe
I ain't mad at nobody
I just wanna have your body
Now, I can give you the key, girl
Or you can meet me in the lobby
Talkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus: Nelly]
Oh, I'll lay you down and go down
Girl, 'til I reach your ocean
So come and get this dick

[Chorus: Jeremih]
When you need that fix, yeah, that medicine
I know you like it like this
When you get that itch, adrenaline
Heart beatin' outta your chest
(Heart beatin' outta yo chest)
And when that pressure's buildin'
I got what you need, come fuck with me
And when you get that feelin'
I got sexual healin'
Baby
(Talkin' 'bout)
Baby

[Verse 2: Nelly]
Bust it open every time I get up inside
Soakin' wet, turn the bed to a slip 'n' slide
Spread eagle, nigga eatin' like it's suppa time
Shawty knows whose is it, it's all mine
I ain't mad at nobody (no-ooo)
I just wanna have your body
And if you can take it deep
Then let a nigga like me, get at that body girl

[Pre-Chorus: Nelly]
Oh, I'll lay you down and go down
Girl, 'til I reach your ocean
So come and get this dick

[Chorus: Jeremih]
When you need that fix, yeah, that medicine
I know you like it like this
When you get that itch, adrenaline
Heart beatin' outta your chest
(Heart beatin' outta yo chest)
And when that pressure's buildin'
I got what you need, come fuck with me
And when you get that feelin'
I got sexual healin'

[Bridge: Jeremih (Nelly)]
Baby
(Talkin' 'bout)
Baby
(Sweat 'em all out)
Baby
(I can't hold it much longer)
Baby
(I'm gettin' stronger and stronger)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
When you need that fix, yeah, that medicine
I know you like it like this
When you get that itch, adrenaline
Heart beatin' outta your chest
(Heart beatin' outta yo chest)
And when that pressure's buildin'
I got what you need, come fuck with me
And when you get that feelin'
I got sexual healin'
Baby
Baby
