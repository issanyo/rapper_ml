[Intro: Jeremih]
Ohhhhh
If I was your man I would even cook it right
Baby we could fuck all night, baby

[Verse 1: Nick Cannon]
Nah, mama, I ain't shit
Nah, mama, I ain't shit
Told you in 2006
It's been 10 years she's still on my dick, haa
And I love you for that
TMZ, she ain't fuckin' with that
Girl you lookin' gooder than government check
Where the ladies with the good pussy at?
Where the ladies with the good pussy at?
Hat to the back swagged out lookin' like Chilli
All my down hoes still kick it with me
All the hood rats still kick it for me

[Hook: Jeremih & Nick Cannon]
If I was your man I would even cook it right
(Heat it up, heat it up)
We could fuck all night, oh yeah
(Beat it up, beat it up)
If I was your man I would never tell a lie (nah)
No reason to make you cry (nah)

[Interlude: Nick Cannon]
Look I know I fucked up
But I'm just sayin' I'm a man and I could be your ex too

[Verse 2: Nick Cannon]
Nah mama, I ain't shit
Nah mama, I ain't shit
I know I'm looking fly in my whip
But I ain't shit
Nick ain't the type nigga to say I'm sorry
Give her joystick like she playin' Atari
Nick been pimpin' since she playin' with Barbie
The rich nigga with bitches, what the haters call me
The rich nigga with bitches, what the haters call me
The rich nigga with bitches, what the haters call me
Back then she ain't want me now she all up on me
Back then she ain't want me now she all up on me

[Hook: Jeremih & Nick Cannon]
If I was your man I would even cook it right
(Heat it up, heat it up)
We could fuck all night, oh yeah
(Beat it up, beat it up)
If I was your man I would never tell a lie (nah)
No reason to make you cry (nah)
If I was your man I would even cook it right
(Heat it up, heat it up)
We could fuck all night, oh yeah
(Beat it up, beat it up)
If I was your man I would never tell a lie (nah)
No reason to make you cry (nah)
