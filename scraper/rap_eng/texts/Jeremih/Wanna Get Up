She say she wanna get up, and play the game like me
Wanna spend some vital time, try to keep it low key
And wanna get up, so we can stay up all night
She fell in love with my ride
And said that I've been on her mind

She textin me like Jeremih I wanna chill I wanna ride
She love the kid I can't deny, she loved to be so mesmerized
She think of me all the time, wanna share all of mines
Reel me up, hold me down, no need to think so I replied
