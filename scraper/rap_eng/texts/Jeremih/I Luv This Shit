[Intro]
Here we go
Man, I love this shit

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Roll the gas and ignite it
You fly, baby, get higher
On them knees, don't wanna feel no teeth
Just suck it, baby, don't bite it
I came here to one-night it, all these girls are invited
Mulsanne, got two chains, watch all these hoes start a riot
Catch me bendin' around the Chi, smokin' on Keisha
Gettin' drop head from a diva in a two-seater, double-cup, 2 litre
I've been thumbin', I've been workin', I've been stackin' all this money
Got these bad bitches on me like my Rollie take the time
Like the bezel on my wrist, I don't cuff cause there's levels to this shit
And I'm way too young to be wifin' this bitch
You're way too fly to be down there with him
Come to close, girl, you gon' get this dick
And tell me that you want it, girl, hop on it, full speed
I'mma tell you I luv it...

[Bridge]
I luv it, I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I tell you
I luv it, I luv it, I luv it
And I'mma keep smokin' cause I luv it
Fuckin' cause I luv it, fuck her now she luv it
Cause I'm gettin' all this money, I be in and out and on it
Girl, you know I luv it
Fuck me like you own it, girl you know I luv it
I luv it, I luv it, I luv it
I tell you, I luv it

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
She said she just got her some titties
(She said she just got her some titties)
Can't wait till' I come to her city
(Can't wait till' I come to her city)
I smoke 'til I choke and I'm dizzy
The liquor's invading my kidneys
Been chillin' and I feel like killin' you niggas
Bitches been missing me lately
They love it when I talk to em' crazy
Suck a nigga dick, do it with alot of spit
Let it drip, yeah, catch my babies
Ooh, that's my baby - just do it like you care
Girl don't worry bout' your hair's fucked up
Cause I'm pullin' it like this
Your man fucked up, he don't do you like this
Feels so good that a nigga might kiss
If you ask her she gon' tell you like this

[Bridge]
God damn it, she loves it, she loves it
She loves it, she loves it, god damn it
She loves it, she loves it
She loves it, she loves it
So I'mma keep on fucking like I luv this bitch
I'mma keep her bussin', cause she luv this dick
I'mma keep stuntin', cause I luv bein' rich
I'mma keep doin', and I does this shit
God damn it, I luv it

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
She said make luv, just make luv, just make luv to me
Right now, and she want to try some new shit
She said when I kiss it, go and sing to her
Like this: La-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la-la)
Don't need full conversation
All we doin' is lickin', and fuckin', and touchin'
Your booty be speakin' another language (ooh, yeah...)
This real life to his fake shit
Bottles in the air, I'm faded, drinking
I'm so fucked up, now I'm talking my shit
I'm so bossed up, I be talking like Rich
Niggas they know, bitches all on my dick
Baby when we play, put this song on replay
She like "Ooh, that's my shit"
