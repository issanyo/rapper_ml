Young burban kid but I got street credit

Only time I see the pin is when a nigga use his debit

I'm livin by the moment and I don't regret it

Wake up in the morning like damn u chick I slept with

Her man blowin up her phone I know he jealous

But she glad she found out that everythang bigger in Texas

I love clothes and I have a shoe fetish

On beats I'm raw dog like sex that unprotected

I'm from a city where fame is close to impossible

But I plan to run this bitch regardless of its obstacles

Went from nothin to 150 n big ass titties

I'm on that kahled shit my whole teams winning

So become a witness this just the beginning

This my story neverending

Hook Chorous: Jeremih
I apologize I don’t recollect your name
(Oooh, baby I don’t know your name)
But lemme tell you that them heels really compliment your frame
(look at your body baby)
Girl lemme get them ooh aahs then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl how could we get that way?

I'm not gonna lie u always on my mind

As soon as I get into town we gon spend some time

You a down ass bitch a chick like u is hard to find

If money makes you cum then my dicks a dollar sign

I love brain so u better bring some knee pads

I stay between her legs chinese freeze tag

Don't be sad she comin home late

We just kickin it she had to escape

Smoke all day fuck her then stack this cake

My eyes solo gotta a nigga in lone star state

210s finest LXGs luetinant

So these beats will C murder my flow has no limit

Real nigga roll call you know a nigga in it

Ya niggas must be tardy I got perfect attendance
