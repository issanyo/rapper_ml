[Verse 1]
Say she wanna get up
Want a nigga pick you up
I know she wanna fuck
Take you when he ain't look
We ain't gotta go to the club
We can fuck around, make our own club
Bonjour it's all the definition
You deserve all that recognition
Uh, I know you love this position
I'm gon' climb on top you dizzy

[Chorus]
The way you make that tootsie roll
Gon' make me broke
No I ain't wearin' no cape baby
But tonight I'm your hero
Way you make that tootsie roll
Gon' make me broke
Betty Crocker, got the cakes baby
Come serve it up for me though

[Verse 2]
She say she tryna get hit
She know I got all of the hits
They feel like I'm ballin' and shit
I feel like Steph Curry
They say J you just don't miss
I give her that D, no offense
Now I'm at the top of her list
I fuck her then get her hair done
Then I rock climb in that pussy
We be grindin' somethin' like Pusha
Got an ass like your sister
I got love for the fam
Thanksgiving, goin' HAM
She do it for me, not the 'Gram
I slide in like DM
From AM to PM

[Chorus]
The way you make that tootsie roll
Gon' make me broke
No I ain't wearin' no cape baby
But tonight I'm your hero
Tonight I'm your hero
Way you make that tootsie roll
Gon' make me broke
Betty Crocker, got the cakes baby
Come serve it up for me though

[Chorus]
The way you make that tootsie roll
Gon' make me broke
No I ain't wearin' no cape baby
But tonight I'm your hero
Tonight I'm your hero
Way you make that tootsie roll
Gon' make me broke
Betty Crocker, got the cakes baby
Come serve it up for me though
