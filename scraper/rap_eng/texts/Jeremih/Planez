Catch me rollin' through the city
Ridin' with the top off
Man, my whip so big when you in it
Mess around and get lost
Tell my girl to let her hair down, what this shit cost?
Tell me, baby, if you 'bout that life right now, I hope it ain't talk, no

I can put you in the Mile High Club, what's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The World Is Yours" on a blimp?

Tell her be free, baby spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane, let me guide that, I'm the pilot
Can't nobody see you, 30 thousand feet
On your knees in them Prada's, makin' it like I can't be without it

Get high baby roll one, cloud nine 'bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin' the turbulence go when we turn up
When we land we can roll out
Show you somethin' you ain't know about
Tonight we be takin' off flight with a camera to show out

I got you in the air, your body in the air, how it feel up here?
You can scream as loud as you want, loud as you can
And ain't nobody gonna hear
Would you like it better if I hit the west coast?
Tell me, if you 'bout that life right now, I hope it ain't talk, no

I can put you in the Mile High Club, what's up? Let's take a trip
