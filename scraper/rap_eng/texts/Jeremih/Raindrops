Let me get them
Ooh's them Ahh's (x4)
Let me get them
Ohh's them Ahh's (x3)
Then we wake up in the morning we can do it again

Verse 1:
Lights out... you bout to get it
Salute me... I'm your lieutenant
Baby girl you better stop making this here an obstacle
Cause I got the artilery I'll just lock and load
Look at them lips... I gotta kiss'em
You blow kush... come hit the swisher
Cause I'm gonna take you higher then mars and jupiter
Then we'll make love in the clouds and fall right down to the earth

Chorus:
Then we'll make raindrops (ohhh)
Raindrops... fallin on our heads
Raindrops (ohhh)
Raindrops
Let me get them
Ohh's them Ahh's (x4)
Let me get them
Ohh's them Ahh's (x3)
Then we wake up in the morning we can do it again

Verse 2:
Round 2... no hesitation
Cause once I'm up... there's more precipitation
Shorty I can take it slow then I might just hit the gas
It's so wet on this trip I might just slip and crash
You at my show... you feel it's magic
Who said tricks are for kids... that silly rabbit
So I'mma hop right up in it then I'mma climb on out
If I stay in it too long then we'll form a thunder cloud

Chorus:
There just be raindrops (ohhh)
Raindrops... fallin on our heads
Raindrops (ohhh)
Raindrops
Let me get them
Ooh's them Ahh's (x4)
Let me get them
Ooh's them Ahh's (x3)
Then we wake up in the morning we can do it again

Verse 3 (Rapping):
Come on
Is it the attraction could I blame in fact
She remains my heart was living pain free
Since I ain't been back up in the game I've been stackin' up my change relaxin' with my main squeeze
At ease cause she's my heart
So yeah stop beatin' if we's apart
Who you know in the streets spit easy bars
Or who even let you get the keys with the visa card
Just me but only cause you the greatest
And I got more chips then Vegas
Plus I got more whips the Avis
Marianna, Jeremih on the playlist
With them sexy lips to her fragrance
And them curvish hips how could you blame him
A queen go to be crowned
So like I ain't cause you know I'mma hold you down

Chorus:
We make them raindrops (ohhh)
Raindrops... fallin on our heads
Raindrops (ohhh)
Raindrops
Let me get them
Ooh's them Ahh's (x4)
Let me get them
Ooh's them Ahh's (x3)
Then we wake up in the morning we can do it again
