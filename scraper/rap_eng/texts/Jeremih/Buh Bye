Yup, Yup
Can't do it (Can't do it)
She says she love me
Then she loves me not
But she don't hate me, if I kick her out my spot
Cause darling lately seems, we've been growing apart
I don't know how much more I could take this
I feel like saying buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, bye
I feel like saying buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, bye
But when I look in to her eyes, eye, eye, eye, eye, eyes
Just can't do it, do it, do it

[Verse 1:]
Never felt this before
Could it be that we lost the flame
That them true lovers have
How did it all just slip away? (away)
Seems so right at the beginning
Now it seems so close to the ending
Like we just friends, I need to breathe again (ohh yeah)
These feelings I'm feeling, starting to drive my crazy
Just the thought of another man making other plans with my lady
And girl I tried and tried hard so we work this out
But I just don't know right now... 

[Chorus:]
Because at times you say you love me
Then you love me not
But you don't hate me, if I kick you out my spot
Cause darling lately seems, we've been growing apart
I don't know how much more I could take this
I feel like saying buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, bye
I feel like saying buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, bye
But when I look in to your eyes, eye, eye, eye, eye, eyes
Just can't do it, do it, do it

[Verse 2:]
Girl when I see your face
It reminds me of the long nights and the good ol' love we made (ohh yeah)
And now I just can't forget it, mind stuck with it
Don't remember the last time I hit it
Breathe again, I need to breathe again (ohh yeah)
And when I call yah, the voice mail I get (you reached Toya)
And I don't ever want to leave my name and number
Playing these childish games
You wanna freeze again, nah I don't need him again

[Chorus:]
But then you say you love me
Then you love me not
But you don't hate me, if I kick you out my spot
Cause darling lately, seems we've been growing apart
I don't know how much more I could take this
I feel like saying buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, bye
I feel like saying buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, bye
But when I look in to your eyes, eye, eye, eye, eye, eyes
Just can't do it, do it, do it

[Speaks:]
Well then again
I probably can
I don't know how longer I can be with you
I guess it's all on you
With these mix signals and all
It's kind of, kinda hard to tell
You know cause one day... 
You say you love me
Then another ... 
Then you love me not
Damn

[Chorus:]
But you don't hate me, if I kick you out my spot
Cause darling lately, seems we've been growing apart
I don't know how much more I could take this
I feel like saying buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, bye
I feel like saying buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, bye
But when I look in to your eyes, eye, eye, eye, eye, eyes
Just can't do it, do it, do it
