And he say fuck that nigga, he so weak
He can't tell that you a freak
That you ain't looking for love
Just want a real one to beat it up
So any girl
I'm tryna hit it [X3]
I'm tryna hit it [X3]

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
I just want you to myself, I don't want nobody else
I want you here on my lap
I need candy from the store
Know the Kid want some more
I just need a piece of that
You can love it now
You can let it babe
When your talent show, let me help ya baby
I want it on the floor, on the balcony
I'mma need some more, can I eat some more
Don't tell me you plan just talking like that
Close your mouth if you ain't tryna back it
Now if you can back it up , won't you back it up
Round after round, ain't nobody tryna nut

[Hook: TeeFlii]

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Annie I'm tryna hit it, hit it
Introduce you to one of my bitches
Annie have you ever had a threesome?
I know you promise your nigga you'll never cheat on him
But now you here in my bed (Yea yea)
And my hand on the back of your head
Hey yea yea yea
And I'mma let you ride on it, ride on it
I'mma hit from the side of it, side of it
Girl let me see your body
Girl, let a nigga get up inside it

[Hook: TeeFlii & Ty Dolla $ign]
And he say fuck that nigga, he so weak (Oohh)
He can't tell that you a freak, (He can't tell)
That you ain't looking for love (That you ain't looking for love)
Just want a real one to beat it up
So any girl

I'm tryna hit it [X3]

(Beat Plays)
