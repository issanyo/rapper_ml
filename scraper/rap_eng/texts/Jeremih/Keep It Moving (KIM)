[Bridge 1]

Damn. this shit Ras B

[Bridge 2]

(Waitaminute)
Keep it moving (on)
It's my time, I don't need it
(waitaminute)
Keep it moving (on)
Even if it' on my own

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
'Member me, woah
Hennessy, flow
All these zeros
I done seen
Dough turn hella in-da-street to industry hoes
Let me see those
I'm just trynna chill
And make a little money
My nigga D Rose
Now, you ain't seen me ridin' 'round in a minute
But when I'm seen, I got the diamonds on
Hatin' ass niggas at the coffee shop
Got the nerve to tell me that I'm grindin' wrong
Bet his girl would want to come, wanted steak
Penthouse up in Vegas, Mandalay
With an ass like, "My God", give it a praise
If I smack that, Annie May, it'll be OK, just-

[Hook]

[Hook + Bridge 2]

[Verse 2: Marcus French]
Damn, drinkin again
Tokin', not thinkin' again
I can share your heart in bed, love
Next day not speaking again
Gotta keep my wheels, G
Yes ma'am, thats why we in a Benz
Dont be my reason to vent
Slow stroke that ass while the record spins
I pulls up, black cherry wet
I'm here now, and I mean trouble
My checks way more than I thought they would be
Bitch, I been seein' double
I used to ride this old Cavalier
Smoked out on the Dan Ryan with the fan flyin'
Cause the air was broke
I'm good now, but back then I was like-

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Woah...uhuh...okay...
Shutup
Drunk text...she call...
Tell her

(Keep it moving)

Sorry, I hope sh__'ll get
Better
But for me to deal with that right now
...uh..never

[Hook]
