[Intro]
Sometimes...
Sometimes, I need a rush

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I need a rush
Sometimes, I need a hit
I heard that's you that got it
Right now, I need a fix
Devil juice on the right
Candlelight for the dinner
Me and you feel so perfect
Satisfaction and bliss
Undress you for a taste
Scent of you for my nose
Yeah, you got my heart drumming
But, I love the rock and roll

[Hook]
Baby, ooh
So sweet, so sweet
Ooh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Bad times, you're never here
Sometimes, I need a dose
These empty nights are lonely
That's when I need you most
Tell me you'll never leave
This right here, yeah, I wanna stay
Where you revolve around me
Everything's night and day
Baby, take me high
Oh, let's kill the monotony
When we play there, together
That's perfect harmony

[Hook]
Ooh
So sweet, so sweet
Ooh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
