Red bottle poppin', the VIP sold out
Won't you come here
And let me put it on you
I jus' I jus' I just wanna try, try
Sing ya a lil' lullaby
We can move fast, then slowly
Amplify me up but please don't blow me
Baby, baby let me light the fuse, fuse
Won't you let me show you what it do, do

[Chorus]
Maybe we should go
(Somewhere where we could)
Feel the bass
(Somewhere where we could)
Feel the bass

Just a little more, oh
(Somewhere where we could)
Feel the bass
(Somewhere where we could)
Feel the bass

(Verse)
She rep the piece down on her hip
The frame proper
Keep the bass, bass
Tear, tear the whole block up
Woa-a-a tear, tear the whole block up
Maybe I should-- how you make it sound like that?
Got it bumpin' around like that
Who'd of known that you could put it down like that?
Ain't no other honestly
Bang bang as hard as me
New king of this R&B

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Whatchu' gon' do
Cause now I'm probably lookin' at you
When I'm hearing this song
Feel it now, now, now
That's what in for you
I'm nothing but the boom
Breaking this off
Whatchu' gon' do
Cause now I'm probably lookin' at you
When I'm hearing this song
Toast it a-le-le that's what in for you
Ain't nothing but the boom
Breaking this off

[Chorus]
