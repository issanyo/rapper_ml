[Intro: Cassie]
Every time you hear my music

[Verse 1: Cassie]
Feelings I ain't never had before
You got my head turning baby
Feeling I ain't gotta look no more
Cause you're what I've been searching for lately

[Pre-Chorus: Cassie]
So if you're thinking about changing up then boy, you're crazy
Take me to another place and make me your lady
Because I'm ready, damn, boy, I'm ready
To be your one and only girl

[Chorus: Cassie]
You make it hard for me to breathe
Whenever you're around
My heart vibrates every time I sense that you're around
That's the sound of love

[Verse 2: Jeremih & Cassie]
Temperature is rising, baby girl I know you like it
When I see your face baby I get so, so excited
But I don't know what to do (no)
I don't know what to say (say)
Cause you're what I've been searching for lately
So if you're thinking about changing up, then girl, you're crazy
Take me to another place and make me your baby
Cause girl, I'm ready, damn, girl, I'm ready
To be your one and only man

[Chorus: Cassie]
You make it hard for me to breathe
Whenever you're around (whenever you're around)
My heart vibrates every time I sense that you're around
That's the sound of love

[Verse 3: Jeremih & Cassie]
Let me turn it up a bit, lights on, like that
When you've had enough, all we do is kiss
And get right back (right back)
You can take my heart baby, it's yours now
Ain't no need to fight that
I see you're on me
Cause nobody ever made you feel like that
I know you need it, the sound's beating
My heart's waiting, our hearts waiting
Every time we get close, mind, body, soul
If I was the first to say it, baby
Would you feel the same way?

[Chorus: Cassie]
You make it hard for me to breathe
Whenever you're around
My heart vibrates every time I sense that you're around
That's the sound of love

[Outro: Cassie]
That's the sound of my heart
It's beating
It's waiting
Just to be loved
I don't know if I'm ready for love
So I don't think I can love you right now
