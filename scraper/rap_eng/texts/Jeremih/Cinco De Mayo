[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Ohhhhh
Get in something
Get in something (Ey)
[??] be get in something
If we could get in something
We could get in something
If we could get in something
Bongo By The Way
Gettin' something

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Gettin tipsy, if she want it, if she like I lick her up, yeah
I go la la la la la la
Dutty whining on that booty, down to pick her up, aye
And say hi-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Boomerang she move, I throw hunnids, she throw it back, wait
I go ai-ay-ay-ay-ay-ya
Scammin' that bartender, with my debit run it up, yeah
Whole bar I'ma buy-ay-ay-ay-ay-ya

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Sandra, Lisa, freaky in my cabana
In Costa Rica, dirty dancin' Diana
They thirsty-thirsty, party like it's the weekend
They tryna get fucked up, everybody here tweakin' (oh yeah)
We wasted-wasted, play swallow the leader
We smoke that good-good, where everybody look Asian
They rolling, roleplay, actin' up, play her role
Talkin' holy moly, slide all up in that donut
Want me to sign the titties, swear she got them knockers
Dance like CB when I'm up in it, get it on and poppin'
Put it up, pull it back up in it, withdrawin' deposits
Now you know that don't make no sense if it can't make no profits, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Get in something (Won't we just)
Get in something (Mix that up)
[??] be get in something (Throw it all up)
If we could get in something (Now you turnt up)
We could get in something ([??] around)
If we could get in something
Bongo By The Way
Gettin' something

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Gettin tipsy, if she want it, if she like I lick her up, yeah
I go la la la la la la
Dutty whining on that booty, down to pick her up, aye
And say hi-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Boomerang she move, I throw her hunnids, she throw it back, wait
I go ai-ay-ay-ay-ay-ya
Scammin' that bartender, with my debit run it up, yeah
Whole bar I'ma buy-ay-ay-ay-ay-ya

[Verse 2: Sanaa]
How did you know?
Where did you learn that from? I just don't know
I did not expect that, you did that tho
Take this, put some in there, let's play some more

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
For sure
I see you zippin' down my pants
But can you sip it with your friends?
Yeah, I'm the real hair weave killer
But I don't pay to sew-in
Now we gon' all do this again, see
Franklin's got me spendin' Benji's
I'm talkin' presidential yo potential if you got the Monica Lewinsky (Wait a minute)
She ball hard, no assist
And she off with the shits
I didn't know you could exist
I kill that, no innocence
I'm too hard to resist
She sealed it up with a kiss (Sealed it)
Body shots, I don't miss (no, no)
Bong-
Ride me long as a trip

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Gettin tipsy, if she want it, if she like I lick her up, yeah
I go la la la la la la
Dutty whining on that booty, down to pick her up, aye
And say hi-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Boomerang she move, I throw her hunnids, she throw it back, wait
I go ai-ay-ay-ay-ay-ya
Scammin' that bartender, with my debit run it up, yeah
Whole bar I'ma buy-ay-ay-ay-ay-ya

[Post-Chorus: Jeremih]
Get in something (Won't we just)
Get in something (Mix that up)
[??] be get in something (Throw it all up)
If we could get in something (Now you turnt)
We could get in something ([??] around)
If we could get in something
Bongo By The Way
Gettin' something
