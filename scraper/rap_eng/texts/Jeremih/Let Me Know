[Intro]
Alright let's do it

[Hook: Aaliyah]
Baby let me know if you'll let me
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
Baby let me know if you'll let me
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know

[Verse 1: Game]
Where the body cams at when they killed Sandra Bland though?
Where the justice system at when the cops go Rambo?
Black lives matter when we talkin' about Philando
But all lives matter when we talkin' bout Orlando
49 dead bodies, 83 in France though
They say Alton had a gun, we ain't see it in his hands though
We screamin' fuck the police but what about Dallas?
All these murders on the news
Every week it's another one, DJ Khaled
How we gon' respect the badge if you don't protect and serve?
They say life ain't a movie but it's feelin' like The Purge
And this rag in my pocket match the blood in the curb
Hear the shots in the hood but can they feel it in the 'burbs?
Turn on the news, get seduced by the words
And the noose on the black man's neck sounds absurd
Summer 16 look like more than a Drake song
And that's just this year, you forgot about Trayvon?

[Hook]
Baby you'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know

[Verse 2: Game]
Why it take 3 days for Obama to respond?
Cause Minnesota 3 days from the White House lawn
Trump and Hillary both cons
Backstab us like the bullets on in back of LaQuan
This ain't The Game, I come to you as Jayceon
With both of my hands up, don't shoot on my palms
Tamir Rice was just a kid and unarmed
Them cops was Cleveland fans, you just killed the next Lebron
We just need a resolution
When did being detained become a fuckin' execution?
Turn on the news, my stomach turnin' to knots
As the world keep turnin', I'm about to turn into Pac
I'm so determined, I promise to sing a sermon
Every night a mother dreads like Busta in Higher Learnin'
Candles burnin' so we marchin' up the blocks
Moment of silence every time a body drops
When the killin' gon' stop?
If they stop killin' us will we stop killin' cops?

[Hook]
Baby, you'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
Yeah, yeah
Now tell me, can you stand up?
Knowin' everybody can't stand us?
Don't they know that hate is a cancer?
Ask around, nobody got the answers
Now tell me, can you stand up?
Knowin' everybody can't stand us?
Didn't know we was livin' in Orlando
People dyin' with their hands up
Now I hope the whole world
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Uhhh, wake up, wake up, wake up

[Outro: Jeremih]
Let me know
Let me know
Somebody let me know
If we gone wake up, wake up, wake up
