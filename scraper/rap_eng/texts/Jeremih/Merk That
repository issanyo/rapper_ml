[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Met this girl Mercedes, she hotter than Haiti
Devil in disguise, her body go crazy
I'm thinking just maybe, let's mob in the Rolls
By the end of the night girl you'll be touching your toes

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
If it's real, if it's real, if it's real
I'm gon' merk it all tonight, mer-merk it all tonight
If it's real, if it's real, if it's real
I'm gon' merk it all tonight, mer-mer-merk it all tonight

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I'ma merk that, baby I'ma merk that
I'ma merk, baby I'ma merk
I'ma merk, baby I'ma merk

[Verse 2: Christina Milian]
Met this boy named JP, rolled up in a 'cedes
He makes me feel high, been digging him lately
I'm thinking just maybe that we should get ghost
By the end of the night, boy you'll be taking me home

[Pre-Chorus: Christina Milian]
If-if-if it's real, if it's real, if it's real
I'm gon' merk it all tonight, night, merk it all tonight, night
If it's real, if it's real, if it's real
I'm gon' merk it all tonight, merk it all tonight, night

[Chorus: Jeremih + Christina Milian]
I'ma merk that, baby I'ma merk that
I'ma merk that, baby I'ma merk that
I'ma merk that, baby I'ma merk that
