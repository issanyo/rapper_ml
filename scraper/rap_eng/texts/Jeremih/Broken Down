Thought you were my star
Thought you were the moon
But since you come down here
I sit so confused
What more can I do
Too speechless to say
They told me that love would
Never feel this way
See down in my heart
I gave it a hunet and one percent all the time
Thinking that I
Could live out these eh-ep-si-si- isodes
No reruns suppose
But then I lied and we stayed in rewind
And Now I'm broken down
Now I'm broken down
Now I'm broken down
Now I'm broken down
Can't say I was blind
I seen this before
For your full attention
It seems I'm at war
Consistently more

There's no more to prove
This treasure hunts over
I found all the clues
See down in my heart
I gave it a hundred and one percent all the time
Thinking that I
Could live out these eh-ep-si-si- isodes
No reruns suppose
But then I lied this heck is divine
And now I'm broken down
Now I'm broken down, yeah, yeah
Now I'm broken down, yeah
Now I'm broken down, yeah, oh
You make it hard to hold you down, down
But you're still hard to do without, out
How do u live with your mistakes, stakes
But then again
Why do
I stay
Yeah
