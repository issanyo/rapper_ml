[Verse 1]
Lethal weapon, she be pussy poppin'
How she do that with no hands?
Come through, throw her the bands
In the air, like is you 'bout that action with me?
Turn the cameras on then she turn to an actress for me
Learned some new moves? Why don't you come practice on me?
She look back while she movin' it backwards on me
I'ma do you dirty while you dirty dancing on my private parts
She my private dancer
She got more friends that could get to business
I'ma work 'em out and I ain't talking fitness
Yeah she wit' it yeah, on that
Getting into the morning
Henny X on my Cognac
Peach emoji for a contact
Never seen a booty this big
Seen you all the way from Vincennes
Big chain on, Slick Rick
Make her, make her change who she came with
Fuck a GPS, let me get lost in it
Like a doggystyle, I'm a dog in it

She feed me grapes, gives me massages
She be runnin' around in the latest
She got "Woosah" first on her playlist
Georgia peach we far from Atlanta
I just mix champagne with the Fanta
We wake up to crepes and mimosas
On the balcony, yeah I be strokin'
