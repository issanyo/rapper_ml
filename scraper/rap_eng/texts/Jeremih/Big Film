[Chorus: Jeremih]
She lookin' like a big film
She lookin' like a film and let's party
She lookin' like a big film
She lookin' like a film and let's party
She lookin' like a big film
Over five hunnid mil, box office
She lookin' like a big film
She lookin' like a film and let's party

[Verse 1: Bobby Brackins]
I love big films
Sorry, don't got no chill
In an 0-18 or an old school
Boo, thang hot, but I'm so cool
Dead with the fashion, killin' it every castin'
Ebony to so beautiful, she belong up in pageants
Poppin' the pharmaceuticals mama left in the cabinet
Gang, gang, it's a knife, I'm stabbin' it
Big film, and baby, it's been real
Thank you for drippin' on me like a windshield
I love how this shit feel, if tomorrow I get killed
Leave her body here, we're makin' a big film

[Chorus: Jeremih]
She lookin' like a big film
She lookin' like a film and let's party
She lookin' like a big film
She lookin' like a film and let's party
She lookin' like a big film
Over five hunnid mil, box office
She lookin' like a big film
She lookin' like a film and let's party

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, J-Lo, Scar Jo, nympho, round 4
She the lead role, play her part though
With no extra baggage, no cargo
Ugh, ugh, every boss need a real wife
Like Scarface needed Michelle Phife
It won't go bad if it gets trife
From this life, on the next life
Bad bitch, she boujee
She got a temper
If I cheat, she might go join the Avengers
Rather be Iron Man, she could be Pepper
My baby a big film, she stay front and center like

[Chorus: Jeremih]
She lookin' like a big film
She lookin' like a film and let's party
She lookin' like a big film
She lookin' like a film and let's party
She lookin' like a big film
Over five hunnid mil, box office
She lookin' like a big film
She lookin' like a film and let's party

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
She lookin' like a big film
Over five hunnid mil, box office
Throwin' them down, them big deals
We sip enough for her to get nauseous
Niggas like to ride with that steal
You need it when you doin' big business
Universal budget, big deal
Sign the dotted line, you know you gold pendant
Hunnid thousand on the wardrobe
Golden like globe, I love your fashion
Halle Berry, Scarlett Johansson
You look so good and ain't even actin'
And I like to ride on big wheels
Since I was a baby, rollin' with my shawty

[Chorus: Jeremih]
She lookin' like a big film
She lookin' like a film and let's party
She lookin' like a big film
She lookin' like a film and let's party
She lookin' like a big film
Over five hunnid mil, box office
She lookin' like a big film
She lookin' like a film and let's party
She lookin' like a big film
She lookin' like a film and let's party

[Outro: Jeremih]
She lookin' like a big film
She lookin' like a film and let's party
She lookin' like a big film
She lookin' like a big film
She lookin' like a film and let's party
She lookin' like a big film
