[Verse 1]
You see the flashy lights
It's like a movie scene
Them stunna shades got you looking like a beauty queen
Without a throne
American, but international

She got her hair done
Styled in designer jeans
Heels on, and her skin type Maybelline
I can't control
The way you walkin, girl, you got me gone

[Chorus]
When I see her, my mind goes to places
I just can't focus when she's on the stage
It's the way she switches her hips with her body
Just proves she's truly the life of the party now

Look at her
She got it
Shawty knows she's the shit
You can tell by the look in her eyes her eyes her eyes
She's like the devil in disguise

When she's on the runway runway runway
Walkin down the runway runway runway
Sexy down the runway runway runway
Take a picture on the runway runway runway

[Verse 2]
The show is sold out
They say she's popular
When she comes out, everybody's watchin her
She's got the crown
Lookin seductive, but still holds a smile (holds a smile)

She's like an angel
I'd say she's heaven sent
From head to toe, lil mama's visual medicine you should see
This shawty's hotter than the third degree (third degree)

When I see her my mind goes to places
I just can't focus when she's on the stage
It's the way she switches her hips with her body
Just proves she's truly the life of the party now

Look at her she got it, shawty knows she's the shit
You can tell by the look in her eyes, (her eyes)
She's like the devil in disguise
When she's on the runway runway runway
Walkin' down the runway runway runway
Sexy down the runway runway runway
Take a picture on the runway

[Chorus]
Wait a minute
Strike a pose
Take a picture (click)
And girl I gotta know your name
Is it Mary Jane?

[Chorus]
Look at her she got it, shawty knows she's the shit
You can tell by the look in her eyes, (her eyes)
She's like the devil in disguise
When she's on the runway runway runway
Walkin' down the runway runway runway
Sexy down the runway runway runway
Take a picture on the runway runway runway runway
She's on the runway runway runway
Take a picture on the runway runway
Tell by the look at her eyes
