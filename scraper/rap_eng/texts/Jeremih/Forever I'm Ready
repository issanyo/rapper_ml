[Verse 1]
Dirty cup of H-Town, take a sip, baby
Only you that I'm thinkin' on the day-to-day
All my life, yeah, it's always been fuckin' pay me
Diamonds dancin' on my wrist like LisaRaye
Players club, now we ballin' how we supposed to
Graduated to the 'Rari, kept the old school
I done ran through new paper, girl, that's old news
Fuckin' on the pool table, all we broke was rules

[Pre-Chorus]
That body language, no discussion, the way she move like she fuckin'
Backwoods full of musty, deep pockets, you can't touch them
She a bad girl, my RiRi, I'm a bad boy like Puffy
She the business and I mind my business
Keep my mind on you, bae, like it's nothing, oh

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, I guess I'm for you, baby
I want to know you, lady
Told you I'm different, don't you act distant
Forever I'm ready, yeah
Yeah, yeah, I guess I'm for you, baby
I want to know you, lady
Told you I'm different, don't you act distant
Forever I'm ready, yeah

[Verse 2]
And I can boost up in the truck, why we always turnin' up?
She had me on the first look, I don't think I call this love
Why every time we get up
Doggy style, make her call me daddy, this ain't puppy love
We can plan, we can trip, I got it, ain't trickin'
Plenty champagne to sip, diamond in, we skinny dip
Know you down to play some games, girl you it
Fucked her on the plane and made a number one hit

[Pre-Chorus]
That body language, no discussion, the way she move like she fuckin'
Backwoods full of musty, deep pockets, you can't touch them
She a bad girl, my RiRi, I'm a bad boy like Puffy
She the business and I mind my business
Keep my mind on you, bae, like it's nothing, oh

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, I guess I'm for you, baby
I want to know you, lady
Told you I'm different, don't you act distant
Forever I'm ready, yeah
Yeah, yeah, I guess I'm for you, baby
I want to know you, lady
Told you I'm different, don't you act distant
Forever I'm ready, yeah
Yeah, yeah, I guess I'm for you, baby
I want to know you, lady
Told you I'm different, don't you act distant
Forever I'm ready, yeah
Yeah, yeah, I guess I'm for you, baby
I want to know you, lady
Told you I'm different, don't you act distant
Forever I'm ready, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
That body language, no discussion, the way she move like she fuckin'
Backwoods full of musty, deep pockets, you can't touch them
She a bad girl, my RiRi, I'm a bad boy like Puffy
She the business and I mind my business
Keep my mind on you, bae, like it's nothing, oh

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, I guess I'm for you, baby
I want to know you, lady
Told you I'm different, don't you act distant
Forever I'm ready, yeah
Yeah, yeah, I guess I'm for you, baby
I want to know you, lady
Told you I'm different, don't you act distant
Forever I'm ready, yeah
