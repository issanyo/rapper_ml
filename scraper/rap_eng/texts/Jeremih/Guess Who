[Intro: Berner & Jeremih]
Oooh-oooh-oooh
She come around, every time she get a chance
And it’s sad, what she’ll do for a bag, and a couple grams
We in the back room, forget about a dance
Yeah forget about your man, what’s your plan, baby girl come on

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Hey love, would you mind if I changed your plans?
If you don't know, know what to do, guess who can

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Tell me what it ain’t, what it is
Got a 'wood full of good of the californication
Know a nigga see you from the stage
When you clap for me babe, had to give you ovation
Oh no, no regrets, just got me a check, might spend it on you
Oh, it don't matter to me, I'ma get it back by the mornin’
Let you ride it out on the backstreets
Took me all night tryin’ to plant seeds
Plus you wanna slide on them satin sheets
We ain't get a chance to make it there
Backseat drivin', we can pull over
We get lit together, hardly ever sober
We just get high, then I go lower
Say you want what I want babe

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Hey love, would you mind if I changed your plans?
If you don't know, know what to do, guess who can

[Verse 2: Berner]
What you want? This ain’t Dom Perignon
This that 42, I bet the night won’t last long
Your man, he don't know what to do
I’ll have yo, bitin’ on your lips till your shit turn blue (shit turn blue)
We blacked out in Vegas (Vegas), woke up in Paris
She cool, but not the type to bring to your parents
We do shit, that your other man can’t (he can)
Oh that ass so fat, it don't fit in your pants (I see you)
It's true, yeah I got a thing for girls like you
But when you leave, please believe, my other bitch slide through
I like em’ young, rich, nasty, we freakin’ in the backseat
Your best friends harass me girl and when your man sleep
I call like

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Hey love, would you mind if I changed your plans?
If you don't know, know what to do, guess who can
Hey love, would you mind if I changed your plans?
If you don't know, know what to do, guess who can
