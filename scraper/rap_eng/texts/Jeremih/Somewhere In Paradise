[Chorus 1: Jeremih]
I believe that if I fly, prolly end up somewhere in paradise
I believe that if I fly, I'll prolly end up somewhere in paradise

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Chancelor the rapper, Chatham the hood
Santa to children, had to bag up the goods
They say I'm savin' my city, say I'm stayin' for good
They screamin', "Chano for mayor," I'm thinkin' maybe I should
Fucked a few A&R's, told 'em, "Bitch I canâ€™t wife you"
Told your ass since day one, I don't like labels or titles
I'm a rascally rabbit, I know that tricks is for addicts
That need fixes for habits, in love with carrots and cabbage
I'm a savage, established, bad bitch magnet, I'm magic
Your majesty, I'm majestic, I think my message is massive
Think you passive aggressive
I think you passed up your prime
Think you passed up your chance to be Chance
Now pass it to Arab
I should have rhymed it with rhyme
Ain't we been here before?
Ain't my principal told me that I can't rap at that show?
Then I rapped at that show, simple as that
Got a complex from Complex off of the simplest raps
And it goes like...

[Pre-Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Fannin' the fire, hands is up higher
Cannot believe it, damn I'm a rider
Ridin' on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it
God is so awesome, devil's a liar
Take 'em to church, but I need a choir

[Chorus 1: Jeremih]
I believe that if I fly, prolly end up somewhere in paradise
I believe that if I fly, I'll prolly end up somewhere in paradise

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Blow out your speakers, roll some more loud
That's the sound of the reefer, I think my parents is proud
Thank my fans in the bleachers
Think my teachers need features
I think I'm walkin' with Jesus, I knew my feet wouldn't drown
I been close to the edge, I been trippin' and stuff
Somebody slipped me a mickey but I ain't giving a fuck
Really, a milli'? How 'bout six billion more
Or I'm outie like how'd he cut that umbilical cord?
As I smoke herb in this Uber suburban dressed in an Urban Outfitters
Shirt and burgundy pair of Jordans
I asked the acid if words were worth worryin' over
Her explanation seemed agitated
She said let me answer your question
With some questions questionin' yours
Like why the devil can't get you?
And why these labels can't catch you?
And why'd he make you so special, why did he bless you?
Think about it
I woke up this mornin', I woke up this mornin'
Gotta smile when I say that shit, I woke up this mornin'
Go!

[Pre-Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
Fannin' the fire, hands is up higher
Cannot believe it, damn I'm a rider
Ridin' on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it
God is so awesome, devil's a liar
Take 'em to church, but I need a choir

[Chorus 2: R. Kelly]
I believe, I believe, there's somewhere out there for us all
There's a paradise (there is a paradise)
I believe that if I die, I'll see my homies somewhere in paradise
(I'll see 'em somewhere in paradise)

[Pre-Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Fannin' the fire, hands is up higher
Cannot believe it, damn I'm a rider
Ridin' on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it
God is so awesome, devil's a liar
Take 'em to church, but I need a choir

[Outro: Choir]
I believe, I believe, I believe
Somewhere in paradise
I believe, I believe, I believe
Somewhere in paradise
I believe, I believe, I believe
