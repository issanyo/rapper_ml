[Intro: DJ Cheddar]

Tantrum Tha Antagonistik!!!!

World Exklusive!!!!

It's the REMIX!!!!!

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I apologize, I don't recollect your name oh baby I don't know your name
And let me tell you that them heels really complement your frame (look at your body baby)
Girl let me get them oooh, ahhs, then I gotta catch my plane
Say you miss me and you wishing for some private time
Girl, how could we get that way girl, how could we get that way

[Verse 1: Tantrum T-A]
The moment that I saw ya face
You turned on all my Flames
Got me feeling some like Rick James
When he off da Jane Girl yo looks intoxikate
I forgot ya name
So please excuse my French, But "Quel est votre name"
I'm not the  blame, It's that dress up on ya chocolate frame
And them heels you rocking wild
But you got them tamed
And I like the way yo hair caress ya face in dollish ways
I say we need some  private time, I gotta private plane
Won't you come chill wit a REAL nigga, drop them lames
They dont respect ya womanhood they treat ypu all the same
They want you for a night but never call throughout the day
They take you outta state, I'll take you out to the shop in Spain
Sip some Chardonnay and listen to some  Marvin Gaye
And let our thoughts alternate beneath the starry gaze
Yea, and I love the way she call my name
Yea she's a REAL WOMAN, She'll make the hardest break....

[Chorus: Jeremih]

I apologize, I don't recollect your name oh baby I don't know your name
And let me tell you that them heels really complement your frame (look at your body baby)
Girl let me get them oooh, ahhs, then I gotta catch my plane
Say you miss me and you wishing for some private time
Girl, how could we get that way girl, how could we get that way

[Verse 2: Tantrum T-A]
Incense aromas, body oil vials on the fireplace
French vanilla candles lit up near the flower vase
Usually I'm rushing it but I'ma take my time 2day
II'ma make you mine before the night end...Hyphenate
I told her...Come on over...Shania Twain
And wear that Pomegranate body spray by the way
She say, she ain't got nothin to wear just lingerie I say ok
Just come bear (beer)
We'll just hibernate
Kosta Browne, Sonoma Coast Pinot wine to taste
It's goin down she pull me close and wrap her feet around my waist
I rock her like a crowd, She love the way I light the stage
And when we bump n' grind, I love the way she ride the bass
I kiss her lips tt hold her many moans that might escape
And called my DJ told him hold the show I might be late

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I apologize, I don't recollect your name oh baby I don't know your name
And let me tell you that them heels really complement your frame (look at your body baby)
Girl let me get them oooh, ahhs, then I gotta catch my plane
Say you miss me and you wishing for some private time
Girl, how could we get that way girl, how could we get that way
