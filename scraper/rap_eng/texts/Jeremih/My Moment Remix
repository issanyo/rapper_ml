[Intro]

[Hook - Jeremih]
Tired of living day to day like everything is alright
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment

[Verse 1 - Jean-Paulo]

Private jet dreams, Bentley's and jet ski's
When that manifest, that's when I'm set free
Thinking where I'll be this time next week
Probably writing rhymes, spitting on a next beat
Skets see the technique, plan to check me
Trap me, web of lies when they text me
Expect me to fall after they sex me
Reverse the courting process, that's messy
'Specially Spanish links in Barcelona
I ain't her owner fam, I just pass her over
When the laughs are over, and the drink's done
Babe if we fucked, then we won't link up

[Hook: Jeremiah]
Tired of livin' day to day like everything is alright
Livin like theres one thing on my mind
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
You say you got that "off" shit? Hell nah
Next time thats mine
Long as I stay hustling im gon' shine
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment

[Verse 2 - Jean-Paulo]

Coco told me chase the dream, told her ride with me
Getting buzzed off life baby, come get high with me
My fam getting fat cos they getting pie with me
Still gotta appetite, really find that quite nifty
All my bars are truth, won't find a fucking lie in it
I can hack the fast life cos I put my drive in it
Welcome to my master room, oh your wife in it
I push my limits, cos I know the fucking sky isn't
Always by your side init, but she bored
When she's with you she yawns...Eeyore
Dior, Chanel, what she feen for
See me doing well, soon to be more

[Hook: Jeremiah]
Repeat

[Verse 3 - Jean-Paulo]

Plush inside...hard shell
All these chicks want to vibe with my cartel
Walking through my city like I fucking own it
Got a date with destiny, this my fucking moment

[Hook: Jeremiah]
