[Verse 1]
Tell me why can I hate?
If I can give you something better
For you babe
I can't stand there and let you get away
I can't do it
I can't do it, I can't do it
I-I can't do it, I can't do it

[Hook]
Later on (we can get this on and popping)
Rated R (oh baby girl he's nothing)
Been through all the movies
Don't care how you do me
I just want to give you all my love
Tell you how I want it baby
So what I'm crazy
I just wanna be alone
And give it to you, baby
And give it to you, baby

[Verse 2]
I brought my extinguisher
I'll put it out, put it out
Lets get a taste of love
Just call 773, 779
Love, love, love

[Hook]
