[Chorus]
I thought I told ya, Imma star
You see the ice, you see the cars
Flashy lights, everywhere we are
Livin' like, like there's no tomorrow
I thought I told ya, Imma star
You see the ice, you see the cars
Flashy lights, everywhere we are
Livin' like, like there's no tomorrow
Oh oh ohh

[Verse 1]
I got money, I don't need a Range
I'm a pimp, I don't need a cane
Big bills Charlie, you could keep the change
Now that I got the torch, I'm a keep the flame
I'm a keep my aim, gotta make the big shots
In my linen suit, Louis V flip flops
Got a bad bitch, her hair and nails tip top
Jeremih got the game on a slipknot
Just before the stacks, I got rubber bands
Consumers only want you to supply demand
So here I am, check my DNA
Gettin' money is the only thing on my résumé

[Chorus]
I thought I told ya, Imma star
You see the ice, you see the cars
Flashy lights, everywhere we are
Livin' like, like there's no tomorrow
Oh oh ohh
I thought I told ya, Imma star
You see the ice, you see the cars
Flashy lights, everywhere we are
Livin' like, like there's no tomorrow
Oh oh ohh

[Verse 2]
Like the dealer ship, I got beaucoup cars
Penitentiary, I keep beaucoup bars
Flow so hot, fried in beaucoup lard
Hollywood ground, I got beaucoup stars
Don't need Roger Ebert or the paparazzi
Take more than the red out the corner, stop me
I got hella licks, man, hella [?]
Hit the weed man, so I can get in touch with Mary Jane
You're a Scorpio, girl get over here
Grab me all night, like you came to Paul Revere
Kissin' on my neck, nibblin' on my ear
You say you wanna chill, go 'head and have a beer

[Chorus]
I thought I told ya, Imma star
You see the ice, you see the cars
Flashy lights, everywhere we are
Livin' like, like there's no tomorrow
Oh oh ohh
I thought I told ya, Imma star
You see the ice, you see the cars
Flashy lights, everywhere we are
Livin' like, like there's no tomorrow
Oh oh ohh

[Bridge]
Now if you back it up, shawty, I'ma stack it up
If you back it up, shawty, I'ma stack it up
You know I'ma stack it up but only if you back it up
Oh oh, ay, oh oh, ay

[Interlude]
Flashy lights
Oh, lights
Oh, lights
Oh oh ohh
Everywhere we are, oh oh oh
Everywhere we are, oh oh oh
Flashy lights
Oh, lights
Oh, lights
Oh oh ohh
Everywhere we are, oh oh oh
Everywhere we are, oh oh oh

[Verse 3]
Ohh
Okay, now I be ballin', I, I, I be, I be ballin'
You can catch me in the air, air, I'll be rollin'
When I'm tryna grab some gear, gear, I be mallin'
In the middle of the club with 1 dolla, you call it
The either the camera's flickin' or the police clockin'
Especially at the end of the month when it's just not an option
Now they got that spotlight on me
Why they put that on me?
Now I'm never lonely
Cause everywhere I go it's...

[Outro]
Flashy lights
Oh, lights
Oh, lights
Oh oh ohh
Everywhere we are, oh oh oh
Everywhere we are, oh oh oh
Flashy lights
Oh, lights
Oh, lights
Oh oh ohh
Everywhere we are, oh oh oh
Everywhere we are, oh oh oh
