[Intro]
(What thing is that?) Pressure. Changes everything. Some people, you squeeze them, they focus. others fold. You summon your talent at will? Can you deliver on deadline? Can you sleep at night? (When do we talk about money?) Money? hahaha, that’s the easy part

[Verse 1]
Money don’t sleep so I ain’t snoozin’
You ain’t gettin’ money, fuck is you doin’?
Ridin’ round gettin it, maybe I’m crusin’
Your girl choosin’ maybe cause you losing
Plenty eyes on, homie I’m coolin’
I just do it, I don’t know what you doin’
All in the eyes because we all up into it
Got plenty molecules homie all of them usin’
I just wanna touch, shawty get it up
Feeling like Houdini levitating up
In that Lamborghini or that Maserati
Speeding through the traffic baby I just rev it up
Said to Pimp C, faded out  juice
Getting hunnies like Winnie the Pooh
Make her dance is what the Benjamins do
You can call us the Benjamin crew

[Pre-hook]
We gettin’ to the money yeah we gettin’ to it
If you ain’t gettin’ no money, fuck is you doin’?
Like Nike throwing me checks,  well just do it
There’s a million ways to get paid if you ain’t know it

[Hook]
(There’s a million ways)
Get paid, get paid, get paid
Get paid, get paid, get paid (to get)
Get paid, get paid, get paid
Get paid, get paid, get paid
(I know you know there’s a million ways)
Get paid, get paid, get paid
Get paid, get paid, get paid
Get paid, get paid, get paid (to get)
Get paid, get paid, get paid
Get paid, get paid, get paid

[Verse 2]
I wake up every morning, money on my mind
Got to go and get it, can’t reverse the time
No more happy belateds, my bills is overdue
They say they just overrated, and it’s overdue
Yeah I’mma stack this money yeah you gonna give it up
Swear ain’t giving no favors, so I’m just not giving no fucks
If you’re not talking about the entree, no more wasting time in my day
No more games time to get paid, check your wrist, time to get paid
