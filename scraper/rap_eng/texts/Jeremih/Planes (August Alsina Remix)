[Verse 1: August Alsina]
Just touched down on the runway
All white on, no Sunday
Step out wave to the haters
Got 'em saying "I'mma be rich one day"
But right now is our time and we winning
Lemme pause, go back to beginning
Seen a chick so bad with an ass so fat
Before the plane took off, I was in her
Got her in the mile high club, she a member (member)
Can't tell you her name, don't remember ('member)
But she took it to the head like a winner (winner)
Had an airplane meal, that was dinner
Lot on her plate, she was pickin’ out
Begging a nigga to dick her out
Now they ain’t lettin’ her back on the plane
Cause the way she was yellin’ and showin’ out
All in first class with the champagne
Sorry lame niggas but you can’t hang
Shawty say she fucking with the campaign
Tap me on the shoulder for the bang-bang
Bang bang bang, do my damn thang
She love the way I beat it up
Say she want it all but then I try, she staying out (damn)
Wanna know how I do it? Girl, I does this shit
And motherfuck the rumors, we above that shit
I just wanna hit the spot, have you in love and shit
If you cool then we can kick it, if you not dismissed

[Pre-Chorus: August Alsina]
I can put you in the mile high club, what's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The world is yours" on a blimp?

[Chorus: August Alsina]
Get high baby roll one, cloud nine ’bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin’ of the turbulence girl when we turn up
When we land we can roll out, show ya somethin’ you ain’t know about
Tonight we be takin’ off flight with a camera to show out

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Catch me rolling through the city
Riding with the top off
Man my whip so big when you in it
Fuck around and get lost
Told my bitch to let her hair down
What this shit cost?
Tell me baby if ya 'bout that life right now
Hope it ain't talk

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
I can put you in the mile high club, what's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The world is yours" on a blimp?

[Bridge: Jeremeih]
Tell her be free, baby spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane
Let me guide that, I’m the pilot
Can’t nobody see you, 30 thousand feet
On your knees in them Prada’s
Make the freaky shit come up out her

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Get high baby roll one, cloud nine ’bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin’ of the turbulence girl when we turn up
When we land we can roll out, show ya somethin’ you ain’t know about
Tonight we be takin’ off flight with a camera to show out

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
(Cole World, I got it, I got it, I got it, listen)
You need a nigga that’s gon' come over and dig ya out
You need a nigga that you know is not gon' run his mouth
You need a nigga when he done probably gon' put ya out
You need a nigga that’s gon' put it in your mouth
Dick so big it’s like a foot is in yo mouth
And you ain't babysittin’, but my kids all on yo couch
And oh, you nasty, oh oh, you nasty
Both graduated, so fuck keeping it classy
Look, they love me in the Chi like MJ
They love me in the Chi like Oprah
No nigga could block, not even Dikembe
Compared to Cole, boy, you’re softer than a sofa
And so far my new shit’s so fire
Nigga, check my profile
Who ya know make waves in the low tide?
Deebo’ed your bitch, now she both ours
Nigga, lil brown liquor in my liver
Pretty brown thang in my bed
Been a long time since I had to ask for head
So goddamn don’t make me beg
But I will if I need to cause forreal
Girl, I need ya
I could put ya on a flight, we could take off tonight
If you scared of heights, shit I got a pill I could feed you

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
I can put you in the mile high club, what's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The world is yours" on a blimp?
