[Hook: Jeremih]
She takin' her clothes off, I fell right in love with her body
I'mma tip it, God damn I'm addicted I know that she got me
Oh I love it, I love it, the way that you climb back when you move
Ain't nobody in here with that body, nobody but you
Nobody but, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody but, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Nobody)
Ain't nobody in here with that body, nobody but you
Nobody but, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody but, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody
Ain't nobody in here with that body, nobody but you

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
All that there make your life straight
I know you been twerkin' since past eight
Ballin' on the bitch like a fast break
As long as I can see you bounce that ass babe
I, I only wanna roll into the tele
Promise I'mma love you long time
You motivate a nigga like Kelly
We should get to rollin' one time

[Bridge: Jeremih]
DJ playin' her song and then she dance for me
I threw it up, then she threw it down that's how it's supposed to be
Don't let go of my eyes you got 'em on cruise control
Your face, your waist, no breaks
Just take away, take away, take away

[Hook: Jeremih]
She takin' her clothes off, I fell right in love with her body
I'mma tip it, God damn I'm addicted I know that she got me
Oh I love it, I love it, the way that you climb back when you move
Ain't nobody in here with that body, nobody but you
Nobody but, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody but, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Nobody)
Ain't nobody in here with that body, nobody but you
Nobody but, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody but, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody
Ain't nobody in here with that body, nobody but you

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Go and change clothes, it's a new scene
Every time you know you make a movie
Ain't nobody in here on the same
You deserve a star up in the hall of fame
Took a little look at my Rolley
And baby girl said it's your time
Seem like in here your're the one and only
That mean I'mma make it all mine

[Bridge: Jeremih]
DJ playin' her song and then she dance for me
I threw it up, then she threw it down that's how it's supposed to be
Don't let go of my eyes you got 'em on cruise control
Your face, your waist, no breaks
Just take away, take away, take away

[Hook: Jeremih]
She takin' her clothes off, I fell right in love with her body
I'mma tip it, God damn I'm addicted I know that she got me
Oh I love it, I love it, the way that you climb back when you move

Nobody but, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody but, you, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ain't nobody in here with that body, nobody but you
Nobody but, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody but, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody
Ain't nobody in here with that body, nobody but you

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
Your body got me teakin' keep me up all night
We've been drinkin', we've been takin' shots all night
Oh I'm so in to it baby, in to you baby
You know that I need it, and don't want nobody but you

[Hook: Jeremih]
Nobody but, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody but, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Nobody)
Ain't nobody in here with that body, nobody but you
Nobody but, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody but, you, yeah, yeah, yeah
