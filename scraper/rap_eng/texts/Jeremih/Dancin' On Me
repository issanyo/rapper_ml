[Hook – Jeremih]
Where you want to start, [?] been waiting
If it’s wings on that ass, don’t you want to get it
With them hands to the maker [?]
You don’t understand, if you’re fly we’ll take you
Dancing on me
Why you want it, dancing on me
I won’t leave
All I know is you’re right here for me

[Rich The Kid]
In love with a stripper, leaving the trap and I’m bringing the Benji
The bricks in the engine, drink in the kitchen
Cuffing a ho but your bitch come up missing
But fuck all your feelings She dancing on me, cause my chain on Guwop
Nigga so icy
Feels good to be rich in a rari
Came up from the bottom, my pockets so stuffed

[Rich The Kid
She working, I know she deserve it
Red bottoms, she run with the burkin
Remi and Persian
Young nigga I ride in the maybach with curtains
I’m gonna [?] ass, while throwing that cash
And she whipping that Jag
All I know is you right here for me

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Rich The Kid]
Back then I was broke but now that I’m rich
Me and your bitch, we making a flick
(Right here, right now)
Young rich nigga, I’m in love with the trap house
She a fool with it, the way that she climbing that pole
She know that I’m famous bought momma a bentley I finally made it
Hurricane, the kitchen they doing their thang
Pick up my bitch from the border
VVS diamonds, it looks like the water
She done dream  about red bottoms, know she got em
Hundred bands cash in my robbins
All the hoes want a young rich nigga
In the back of the Bentley I’m counting

[Hook]
