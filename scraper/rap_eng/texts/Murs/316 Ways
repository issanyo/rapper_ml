[Verse 1: Murs]
The industry is dead, long live the king
Drop from a headshot, and it didn’t feel a thing
Woke up this morning with the world in my hand
Money in my pocket, fly girl on your man
On the other hand, I could never waste time
I’m a everyday victim of a random hate crime
It’s a scandalous game when you handle in vain
Every amateur and lame wanna slander your name
Fake love, fake hugs, fake thugs, fake blood
They turn around and sell it to the public like they answers
I’m just so appalled
Especially now I got as much dough as y'all
And I ain’t never had to kill nobody, never had to sell coke
Spend it while you can, cause we all go to hell broke
This morning had the world in my hands
So I gave it to the meek but y'all wouldn’t understand

[Hook: Murs]
I got an army of the righteous to defend me
God on our side, so we pray for the enemy
316, 316, 316 ways to kill the industry
Got an army of the righteous to defend me
God on our side, so we pray for the enemy
316, 316, 316 ways to kill the industry

[Verse 2: Murs]
316 ways to kill a hater dead
Thou shall not kill, so I let 'em motivate instead
Two commandments, die and pay taxes
Fight to stay righteous while I’m living in this bracket
Crooks in the castles, profits in the projects
Black man president, still the world’s a hot mess
So God bless everybody trying to do right
Shock G bless me, I’ma do what I like like
Walk on water, swag on holy
Microphone blessed by the based god homie
And Ski cooked up this heater
Rising to the top over all these bottom feeders
I don’t follow, I’m the leader
I write that OG, you could keep the retweeters
So the script’s authentic
Hip-Hop needed love, so I put some God in it

[Hook: Murs]

[Verse 3: Murs]
And I never fired one shot
Ain't no higher power than the one that I got
No napalm necessary
The rap game's now a cemetery
And I'm dancin' on your grave
You was born a free man, but died a industry slave
These 360 deals is craze
They call it 360 cause you trapped in a maze
And I'm amazed by the ignorance
Money made y'all a bunch of million dollar idiots
You still spending money on jewels
I took my money out to Africa to build more schools
And still got enough to take a cruise with my lady friend
Pull up to your spot in a drop-top Mercedes Benz
You see you give then you get back
But I'mma be dead before you lames ever live that

[Hook: Murs]
