[Intro: Luckyiam.PSC]
Ha ha it's going down right now
The proceeds from Grouch's album is going out to charity
Ha ha. Grouch ain't no racer! What? Saver!
Aye peep this right here

[Verse 1: Luckyiam.PSC]:
The light was on upstairs we was unprepared
For the next event but the circumstance left
A cool sense of surprise, eyes widen up
When some speakers with talons raise the mic in the clutch
Right smack in the middle of it all
We continue with a smidgen of patience to deliver
Follow these messages translated aided by a flow
So similar to lettin' yourself go
Freely on the stand still, patience wearing thin, but we wait
So we don't, so we ain't slow rollin' through the gate
As we raise fine art through this origin hip hop
Undoubtedly rising to the top to be fresh
Equals me and my crew
The best way to kick it and forget about the blues of not being on TV
Summon up the skills of comin' up
And summon all thoughts of creativity
Testin' your vicinity

[Verse 2: The Grouch]:
I heard that good things come to those who wait
But I hate laggin' ass dead time like a line with no bait
And I be sittin' at the dock of the Bay fiendin' for mics
Dreamin' of nights where wishes come true
And the bitches come through
Where new Nikes are worn and warm meals are served
Along with any form of MC, who had the bit of nerve
But I observe that's not the case, at every time and place
I ask the future for the answers to the questions that I face
I had a place called contentment but the rent was too high
Got evicted from that shit now I'm bent through the sky
I spy my patience like the enemy (enemy)
It's like a nation that pretends to be down until you turn around
I yearn for sounds of bliss so brisk you can't ignore them
And the more men who listen, the smoother my mission flows
Addiction grows like seeds as my need to achieve feeds me
I'll take a rest after the leave

[Chorus: Luckyiam.PSC]
Freely in the standstill, patience wearing thin, so we wait
But we don't, so we ain't slow rollin' through the gate
As we raise fine art through this origin hip hop
Freely in the standstill, patience wearing thin, so we wait
But we don't, so we ain't slow rollin' through the gate
As we raise fine art through this origin hip hop

[Verse 3: Eligh]
Sending gifts of understanding to those not understood
Except the faggot ass MC's, no interpretation is good
That's how I'm living, that's my understanding unchanged
Or deranged by the city no matter how strange
My gauge is knocking, full speed full throttle
Bust a bottle on the concrete, it's that's long lasting anger
Casting shadows over strangers
In front of Blondie's I slang tapes
Or at least attempt knowing nobodies exempt from being broke
Being a smoker I need loot for support
Getting the boot when I fish
The lake, no permanent residence
So I partake on a search, a bird without a perch
Specifically a crow lost in the hot snow
No nest, no money to invest
Scraping wood chips doused with resin, mostly cess
A little bit less then happy, I keep my penmanship on point
I said what I meant keeping two fingers to the joint

[Verse 4: Sunspot Jonz]
Wake, up, fool! (Now come on here, look look)
Do you wanna buy this shit or not?
I ain't got no time to listen
Do admission for promo?
Oh no, don't make me get live
Half those arrogant DJ's got our shit but don't play it
Leavin' underground and MCs feelin' mad and underrated
I hated givin' a DJ my shit
Boy I know he wanna ride the East coast dick (get off they...!)
That's why I stopped goin' to [?] in Frisco (put your hands back down)
That's why I never kiss no ass to get 'em to bump my single
No, now they be like, 'Y'all is worldwide
Can I be your DJ?' (huh?)
And I think back to when your bitch made ass wouldn't give me no play in the Bay
Until you saw us kickin' it in Rap Pages (oh)
A rocket swingin' outta your bottles in Monte Carlo
You started trying to see we could control our destiny
Well those fools is scared to see
You be frontin' in the bar, ridin' in your partner car
Talkin' bout shit you never gonna do
Thirty-five, broke but cool, walkin' your baby daughter to school, beeotch(and that ain't even your baby)
Gimmie mine
Get out the way (ha ha)

[Chorus: Luckyiam.PSC]
Freely in the standstill, patience wearing thin, so we wait
But we don't, so we ain't slow rollin' through the gate
As we raise fine art through this origin hip hop
Freely in the standstill, patience wearing thin, so we wait
But we don't, so we ain't slow rollin' through the gate
As we raise fine art through this origin hip hop

[Verse 5: Murs]
Now ninety-nine percent of these motherfuckers out now don't know shit about sellin' they own tape
But give these niggas a deal
They bad as Superman without the cape, wait
When the album don't get bought
And the label drop your ass (drop) you find out you wasn't as fly as you thought
Caught ground zero, another hometown hero turned has been
While me and my crew just look at your ass then laugh
Then throw your tape out the window on the freeway
We finish the night countin' our money from sellin' tapes the G way
And that's tax free, now if you ask me
All you signed motherfuckers need to attend underground college
And under me attain the knowledge on how to properly MC
I'm watchin' Rap City, MTV
Waitin' for somebodyto ring the gong
Yeah that video is hella fresh, but it ain't got shit to do with your song
Now not all these crews will ever know the meaning of payin' dues
But claimin' they mastered the lessons
But when they holdin' a drink and a mic in the other hand
Become the meaning of stage presence?
And backstage can't protect you from the rage of this teenage wonder
Make you state your name, rank and serial number
Before I put you under
And add another stripe to the coat
See I snipe to the throat will full metal jacket tactics
Cultivated on the streets of Mid City LA
Where niggas don't play that
You said that on the album you better live it
Or give that shit a rest
I'm tired of you motherfuckers not gettin' put to the test
And I'm not believing' that you sockin' niggas in the face just for breathing
Deceiving' the blind
Throwin' out swine to all these starvin' minds
And you'll find none in which you can compare me
Cause I ain't done shit unless it's Legendary
Bitch

[Chorus: Luckyiam.PSC]
Freely in the standstill, patience wearing thin, so we wait
But we don't, so we ain't slow rollin' through the gate
As we raise fine art through this origin hip hop
Freely in the standstill, patience wearing thin, so we wait
But we don't, so we ain't slow rollin' through the gate
As we raise fine art through this origin hip hop
Freely in the standstill, patience wearing thin, so we wait
But we don't, so we ain't slow rollin' through the gate
As we raise fine art through this origin hip hop
