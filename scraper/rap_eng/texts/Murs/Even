[Hook] [Murs]:
"You acted like"
A bitch with a dick
"You acted like"
A manly ass chick
"You acted"
Like you rolled lickedy split
"I thought I'd take it out on you"

[Murs]:
I'm outta here, outta my mind, I'm Audi five
You outta your league, and definitely outta line
Keep my mouth outta ya name, you out for fame?
Then I'm pushin' you right outta the game
Before you get your whole soul snatched outta your frame
Not out to explain, cause you out-and-out lame
And I better not see you when I go out
Cause I'm leavin' in 'cuffs, I ain't leavin' any doubt
I'm wipin' you out, wipin' you clean
Outta the scene, wipin' the green right outta ya spleen
I'm mean
An outsider, out casted
You don't want war, you will be outlasted"

"You acted so naive"
