[Intro]
So you told me that you didn't want a card, or you didn't want a generic ass card so
I had to write somethin' in a card
But, instead of writin' something in a card  I wrote this

[Verse 1]
I met you on the road at a show in a small town
Who'da thought we'd be at where we are now
Never thought I'd be the type to find romance
Back in the day I was the dude who had no chance
Girls in school used to say no to slow dance
Dream was to find a girl like you so we could hold hands
And now we standin' at the alter
Quite a rocky road just to get to this part, huh?
I'm a Pisces, I went back and forth
You a Sagittarius, connected at the source
I was married and divorced  and you stayed away of course
Now it's ten years later and we're one with the force
Time got lost and we fell off track
You'd try some of this and I'd try some of that
But when love is the law, then the law is attract
Picked up the pieces now we back, back, back
On the scene, crispy and clean
Got a text from my ex, but she can't intervene
She seen the pictures of you on my socials
Then she went through the roof and went postal
But we finally made peace now I'm hopeful
'Cause I ain't got time for the loco
I take that back, 'cause I'm crazy 'bout you
That's why we exchangin' vows and I'm saying "I do"

[Chorus]
Do you take...
To be your lawfully wedded...
To have and to hold...
For better or for worse...
From this day forward...
For richer or for poorer...
'Til death do you part
I do

[Verse 2]
And if I say it's more than physical
Lie like I don't love it when I'm stickin' my dick in you
Just the tip, just the tip
You might make an honest man out a crip
And this is it, this is it
It's about to be the very last time I commit
I'm goin' down with the ship
So if you ever try to leave me you'll be one dead bitch
J-K, J-K, L-O-L
'Cause next time I see your pops, he'll probly tell me "Go to hell"
Oh well, if I should go prematurely
It's just like all them other nights you had me comin' early
See, you laugh at all my jokes and shit
The type of stuff that other folks might deem inappropriate
So we eloped and got hitched
The ceremony was dope, it went like this

[Chorus]
Do you take...
To be your lawfully wedded...
To have and to hold...
For better or for worse...
From this day forward...
For richer or for poorer...
'Til death do you part
I do

[Verse 3]
You put the seed in the hole, and the hole in the ground
The green grass grows and the belly gets round
And I found that the apple's not far from the tree
If we have another son, I hope he looks like me
Hope he has your heart, your style and your smile
And yeah it hit us hard when we lost our first child
Devastating, but it only brought us closer
We stuck together like a team is supposed to
I know them vultures they was talkin' shit, they was hatin'
For us to lie down and quit, yeah they was waitin'
We kept pushin', we expectin' again
And we ain't got time for them so called friends
Us against whomever, up against whatever
Just need that Rev Run, 'cause we tougher than some leather
Fake leather, 'cause you know with both Vegan
But if you ever said these vows, then you understand the meaning

[Chorus]
Do you take...
To be your lawfully wedded...
To have and to hold...
For better or for worse...
From this day forward...
For richer or for poorer...
'Til death do you part
I do

A little piece of me
A little piece of you
Hopin' we can see it through
Hopin' we can see it through
I wrote this one for me and you
A little piece of me
A little piece of you
Hopin' we can see it through
Said I'm hopin' we can see it through
I wrote this one for me and you
A little piece of me
A little piece of you
Hopin' we can see it through
Said I'm hopin' we can see it through
'Cause I wrote this one for me and you
