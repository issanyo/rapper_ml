[Verse 1]
From the moment that I met her, I knew that she'd be mine
We were twins, best friends, perfectly aligned
I loved Carrie Bradshaw, she loved Hennessy
We were two halves of the same energy
She was from NY, I was from LA
She said that she liked me, just not in that way
And that was okay, I win her heart through friendship
But once I had that, there was the distance
I dated 'round the way, she dated local dudes
We had something but neither of us wanted to move
We knew we'd be together, we didn't know when
But long distance love, never thought it would end
The feelings never changed, until the call came
You were engaged, I was in pain
It was such a shame, the timing it just wasn't right
So I say good luck, and then I say goodnight

[Hook]
We back and forth, we in and out
Is this love? What's this about?
We forth and back, we out and in
Is this love? Or we just friends?
(Back and back and forth and forth
Back and back and forth and forth
We move back, we move, forth, we move out, we move in
Now they're playing our song and we dancing again

[Verse 2]
Then there she was, and I forgot
We were in love, she took your spot
Shot through the heart, I never thought I'd feel so good
I was appreciated, I was understood
She was from my hood, we hella hit it off
I had to lose your number, she said we couldn't talk
But I keep tabs on you through mutual friends
Kinda hoping that your engagement would come to an end
And then it did, but I didn't care
You were into me, I just wasn't there
I had a girl, and I couldn't leave her
But she could tell I loved you, so I had to leave her
You and I talked, we made a deal
If this shit ever end, we would be friends still
Deep down, I always knew I'd never be complete until
I knew this thing between you and I was really real

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The first time we made love it was unreal
Let's go get them rings, it was a done deal
Wonder why we wasn't doing this the whole time
We named kids, looked at cribs, the whole nine
We planned the wedding, we told our friends
They said that we were happier than we had ever been
It was exactly like I thought it'd always turn out
A future so bright eventually it burned out
And there it went, down in flames
Too many differences, too much the same
We yell and scream, we cuss and fight
Relationships need balance and we were just too much alike
Now we only talk on funerals and birthdays
Probably should've never got together in the first place
But all the dancing and messing around
Helped me finally realize when it was time to settle down
