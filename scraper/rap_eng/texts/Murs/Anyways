[Verse 1]
Square as a box, I stay in my lane
My daddy left my family, cause of rock-cocaine
Ma's working hard, for us to maintain
If you didn't live it, it's hard to explain
From the outside, it looks insane
Once you touch that hard white, it's hard to make a change
We hoop the cop coups, we slang to have thangs
My homie slang 'caine, I chose the rap game

[Hook]
I coulda made a million flying birds up the interstate
Ice diamond medallion 'bout the size of a dinner plate
If I don't sell it to 'em, they gon' get it anyway
Gon' get it anyway
They gon' get it anyway
I coulda made a million flying birds up the interstate
Ice diamond medallion bout the size of a dinner plate
If I don't sell it to 'em, they gon get it anyway
Gon' get it anyway
They gon get it anyway
Everybody getting paid

[Verse 2]
Daddy ain't home, he selling dope on the corner
His best friend been turned informer
He got them clacks coming from Arizona
To you it's a movie, for him it's just normal
Enormous pounds of white
Child of the night
Counting 50 G's to himself every night
Racks on racks on racks
Hit the strip club, they show him straight to the back
That's the life, that he lives
Whenever in Miami he just live at live
Give it 3 years and he a Rico case
Ain't no telling how many years he gon' face
Coulda been me cause we from the same neighborhood
Every time he offer me some work I just say I'm good
So this rap shit better pan out
Or I'mma be the nigga asking for a handout

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They bring it in on big boats
And arrest us for trafficking like a sick joke
It ain't a option for the rich folk
But for us it's live broke or flip dope
Live broke or flip coke
Live broke or flip dope
Forget hope and flip coke
Forget hope and flip dope

[Hook]

[Outro] (x2)
Anyway, anyway
They gon' get it anyway
Anyway, anyway
They gon' get it anyway
If I don't sell it to 'em, they gon' get it anyway
Gon' get it anyway, everybody getting paid
