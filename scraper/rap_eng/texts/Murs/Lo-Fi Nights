Verse 1:
Woke up and put the hose out
Live gang 5, (?) J couldn't Close out
(?) and no winning
I'm hella sick of pretending
Like I just don't want to end it
If I can finish the pain
Without feeling the shame
I'd take a gun from the range
And put that shit to my brain
And bang (bang)
I grew up on the Bible
But I don't wanna lie bro
I'm feeling so suicidal
All these trials and tribulations
Remember that you're bigger than
The problems that you're facing
So you take 10 paces
Then turn around and shoot
All of your fears in their faces
Execute and assisinate
Low-fi shit unproductive as I procrastinate
Yeah, unplugging and still thuggin'
OG delivering truth to all the youngins

Chorus:
Low-fi night we living low-fi nights
Low-fi night we living low-fi nights
Low-fi night we living low-fi nights
Low-fi night we living low-fi nights
I'm too low-fi for your technology
My mind too wild for your psychology
My God too big for your biology
So I'ma keep on living my life with no apology

Verse 2:
Now once upon a time in the land with no reception
I came across a wire then I made my connection
I got in tune with myself
Baptized underneath the full moon for my health
If wealth is there in spirit
In poverty of the pocket
All I ask is that you pay me attention
And I'ma rock it
Got it got if I need it, if not than i don't need it
Force yourself to fall in love with your future
And then repeat it
The secret keep it simple
Results will be monumental
Most ultimate of warriors
Entering continental
Champion with champions
Place me up in the pantheon
"Only Gods Can Judge Me"
In songs is how I answer them
Scribbling these phrases on pages
And make em dance for them
Play me for your friends
But I'm probably too advanced for them
Ears to the underground
Call it noise cancelling
Pull the plug on the power it's time to channel in

Chorus:
Low-fi night we living low-fi nights
Low-fi night we living low-fi nights
Low-fi night we living low-fi nights
Low-fi night we living low-fi nights
I'm too low-fi for your technology
My mind too wild for your psychology
My God too big for your biology
So I'ma keep on living my life with no apology
