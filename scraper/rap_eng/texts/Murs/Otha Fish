[Verse 1]
It took a second to register up in my brainium
My dome, my head, my skull, my cranium
My eyes have had enough, it was time to do some talkin'
I had to creep through the hound-dogs that were stalkin'
This slimmy caught me peepin', this means she wasn't sleepin'
On who I was, so she crept in like a hawk
In a minute's time, we adjourned to the floor
Ooh! I hit a high note cause of the way that she was walkin
We got into the groove, I didn't bust no, uh, hip-hop moves
I just kept it nice and smooth
Next thing you know, we got together, word, I thought we'd be forever
Didn't have an um-ber-ella, now I'm soaked in stormy weather
Whether two birds of a feather fly or fall it'll be together
Never sympin, and leave your love life limp
There'll be no suicide attempts for this slim-trim kid
Cause you know there's otha fish in the sea, that is, in the sea
In the sea that is

[Hook] (x3)
In the sea
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is

[Verse 2]
I reminisce, try to clear up all the myths
For an imaginary kiss with you again
Not even friends, though I wish that I could mend
Like a tailor and be Olive Oyl's number one sailor
I ams what I am, still I falls like an anvil
She's heavy on the mind sometimes it's more than I can handle
But men aren't supposed to tumble into the den B
Macho, but a honcho like Pancho will give in
Family oriented, but not Oriental
A dame is supposed to claim ya even if you drive a Pinto
A hero is a sandwich, and a Manwich is a meal
A marriage is a paper, are they fakin or for real?
What's the deal dabbers? Will you go tumbling after
Your man and take a stand or will you help him roll faster?
The reason why I ask you is because I'm sick of this
Bitch lickin drip drip from a niggas benefits
He doesn't even suit ya and he's surely not ya size
I'm surprised that you slept on a heart that's worldwide
And when ya open up ya eyes, babe, my mate, I really wish
That ya don't bruise a limb, as ya swim with otha fish in the sea
In the sea that is

[Hook] (x3)
In the sea
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is

[Verse 3]
Now, if there ain't no mountain high enough
Why ain't you climbin' up?
My hand has been extended every since the day I lent it to ya
I thought I knew ya, but I didn't even know ya
Bro, you're stupid, cause ya thought you'd captured Cupid
And you found that love ain't two whiffs of shit
So I resign and quit
It ain't even about the hips, or the lips or the tits or
Even the pussy whip, Elizabeth, this is it
Because I slipped and I tripped into a shoe that didn't fit
And now the next man is stealing my heart away
I'd charge him like a bull, but his pull never fades me
The kid is going crazy, they steppin' with my lady
Their workin' on a baby, I'm pushin' up the daisies, but
Hey diddle diddle, I won't play second fiddle
To no man and stand firm on this
And seal up on the bliss with a big juicy kiss
Just call me Big Gibraltar miss
No, I won't diss, I'm just like all the otha fish in the sea

[Hook] (x3)
In the sea
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
