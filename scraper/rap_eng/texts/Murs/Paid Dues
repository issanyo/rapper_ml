[Intro] [MURS talking]
So yeah man, we them dudes man
You man not see us on the, on the TV with your favorite rapper
You may not, hear us on the radio with the rest of them motherfuckers
But I guarantee you, when you come to your city
We-we some real motherfuckers. And our show is realer than a motherfucker man
We makin' more money and we makin' better music man. Paid Dues motherfucker!

[Verse One] [MURS]
We them dudes still rappin' over samples
Livin' by words, we the real life example
We live the dream, no matter the cost
You still sleepin' on us?
Then it's your loss
I ain't just some second stage openin' act
I open up minds and I make impact
I kicked the door open to the game in fact
I created that lane you in, so kick back fool
I come in peace but I'm from the streets
A certified beast when it comes to beats
Workin' ten times harder than your favorite rapper
Rollin' with them psycho's it's a new chapter
They respect cause I pay my dues
A real hustlin' motherfucker
Ain't afraid to lose
You keep your head up and stay out of the pen
You invest in yourself and you always win

[Hook] [Sick Jacken] [x2]
Paid dues
Yeah man we paid dues
You don't understand the things we been through
Paid dues
Yeah man we paid dues
Standin' on stages and slayin' these fake crews

[Verse Two] [Supernatural]
Pay homage
To the bombest
Telepathic thoughts
On the mic like Nostradamus
Constellations and stars in my bars when I spit
These styles are all real and they not counterfeit
This is a mean sixteen that is pristine
Cleaner than the red paint that's on Christine
Understand
I'm much more now than a man
Do miraculous things when the mics in my hand
I paid dues and got battle scars to show it
Live MC if y'all did not know it
A was born and raised a poet
Hard as they talk
Then I moved to the streets of New York
An Indiana native
And they was convinced
It makes sense
Met up with Grand Master Caz he made me a prince
Yeah, an old Zulu warrior from the past
Super Nat burn that ass to ash

[Hook] [Sick Jacken] [x2]
Paid dues
Yeah man we paid dues
You don't understand the things we been through
Paid dues
Yeah man we paid dues
Standin' on stages and slayin' these fake crews

[Verse Three] [Sick Jacken]
I hit the street with more product the Feds brought in
I'm doin' home invasions now cause the west forgot us
I crack shows and crack skulls
Your act blows
A Living Legend and a Psycho who smash most
I paid dues like the M.A.A.D. Circle
The whiskey's gentleman
The master's purple
The mask is universal
It's +Sick Side+ worldwide if you haven't heard
You're tuned in to Sick Jack, Super Nat and MURS
You won't catch us gettin' pub on the airwaves
Hit the streets, hard boulevard, Kings of L.A
Hip hop is underground and pop gets the airplay
Ask the people what they wanna hear
See what they say
I stay heavy on the grind with mine
Jump on stage, it's the only way my rhyme will shine
The soldiers and gorillas combine it's one time
Audio clips
And spit straight bullets at your fuckin' mind

[Hook] [Sick Jacken] [x2]
Paid dues
Yeah man we paid dues
You don't understand the things we been through
Paid dues
Yeah man we paid dues
Standin' on stages and slayin' these fake crews
