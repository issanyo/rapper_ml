[Verse 1: tabi Bonney]
And I, and I, need to be with you tonight
Tell a broad get with me at the speed of light
Neo-soul flow, Jill-Scott overload
Tour bus, fifty cities, meet me on the road
PYT count max, on overload
Gorgeous girls all around, don't overdose
I need a real girlfriend, baby hope you know
We can make love all night, in slow mo'
You don't even know
Take it back to the hip hop Summer nights
Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte
Put me on the mic
For the love of my heart, you could break-dance in the park
Need a b-girl with a killer arch
Play the lead role in my life, such a killer part
And if we ever grow apart, which is never
Cause' forever we will have hip hop
So let's rock

[Hook]
Hip hop and love
I remember the first time we hooked up
Can't remember the last time we broke up
Hip hop and love
I remember the first time we hooked up
Can't remember the last time we broke up

[Verse 2: Murs]
She the one, to my two-step
Perfect sixteen, that I ain't get to do yet
New J's, no hoody --- just a crew-neck
Then I got with you, when I knew that I was too fresh
She swag me the hell out
Knew Public Enemy ain't ever gonna' sell out
Cause what we got is priceless
Mary J, real love --- Spike couldn't write this
Watching brown sugar with the lights off
Used to sleep over on your nights off
Used to call me your sugar bear
Listening to 2Pac, you would let me pull your hair
Throwing that D'Angelo and slow up
The type of love to make a b-boy grow up
You know the type of love that never stops
So put this ring on your finger, baby girl, and let's rock

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Murs]
Used to listen to the Fugees - The Score
Nowadays we don't talk no more
Before you hooked up with your new thing
We was bumpin' that Wu Tang
Blasting Outkast, and the Roots
Those were our favorite groups
I remember music we would listen to
When I'm reminiscing over you, my god

[Hook]
