(Murs)
Skream skream skream...

Now listen to this might change the way ya think
Like a DUI might change the way ya drink
After listenin to this ya may need to see a shrink
The tune is insane we gon take it to the brink

It all slows down time gets lost
Wether we can follow cause the grinds too soft
I'm all for my own shit dressed like I'm homeless
Style so free can't nobody on this

And this is 8-bit attack shit the speaker doin backflips
This is Murs and Skream and we killin all that wack shit
We murder sonicly
We bully shit bionicly
Holdin shit down it's a devious dichotomy
8-bit primitive your future's so limited
Ya talk about your dreams but with no means-a gettin it
Ya see the difference is
We on that different shit
It's Murs with Skream
Now the whole world can witness it

Nah guess who came through the front door bangin
One leg up on the speaker nuts hangin, danglin
Everybody lookin at him strange and he dont give a fuck
He got his dreadlocks swangin
Fucked up, singin in a whole 'nother language
UK sound with the Yankee twangin
From the land of the smog and gangbangin
This is LA nigga, mother fuck what you claimin

And this is 8-bit baby
And ain't this crazy
It's Murs with Skream
Don't it sound amazing?
Turn it up, put your ear to the sound
This is Murs and Skream
This is how it goes down

And this is 8-bit tune-in (??) make the room spin
Spot the flyest chick in the room and then you move in
This is 8-bit we killin all the fake shit
Its murs and skream mother fuckers come and hate this

Terminology, reverse psychology
Adios science, dub, anthropology
Im the professor applyin that pressure
All praise be cause we children of a lesser
Light storm I move through this life form
Heatin up the rap cause the track here is quick warm
I keep my music loud and my women dark
Smokin fags out lookin for some shit to start

And ain't this crazy it's Murs and Skream
Don't it sound amazing?
Turn it up, put your ear to the sound
It's Murs and Skream
This is how it goes down

And this is 8-bit, tune in
Drink until the room spins
Spot the flyest chick
In the room n then ya move in
This is 8-bit we killin all the fake shit
Its Murs and Skream mother fuckers come n hate this

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 rappers claimin this they year
But they better wait
Or get split like the head off a snake
Skream make this shit that you just can't make
Like a fire I'm spittin that brimstone
Bring all the ladies to the front and leave the men home
I'm in the endzone, hah, and I'm celebratin, yea
American football, ya'll need a translation?

And this is 8-bit baby
And ain't this crazy
It's Murs and Skream
Don't it sound amazing?
Turn it up, put your ear to the sounds
This is Murs and Skream
This is how it goes down

And this is 8-bit, tune in
Drink until the room spins
Spot the flyest chick
On the floor and then ya move in
This is 8-bit we killin all tha fake shit
Murs n Skream mother fuckers come n hate this

This is 8-bit attack shit the speaker doin backflips
This is Murs n Skream and we killin all that wack shit
Murder sonicly
Bully shit bionicly
Holdin this down, a devious dichotomy
8-bit primitive your future's so limited
Ya talk about your dreams but with no means-a gettin it
Ya see the difference is
We on that different shit
It's Murs with Skream now the whole world can witness this
