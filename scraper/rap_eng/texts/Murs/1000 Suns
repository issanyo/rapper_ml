[Verse 1]
What up, my name is Nick, they call me Murs though
Hate to stare but you was lookin' at me first though
So?
I ain't hearin' it
You ain't got a ring, then he probably not that serious
And I'm just curious, if you feel what I feel
Now she lookin' down at the ground so I know it's real
Don't know what to say, she bumped my tray and made my soda spill
You don't gotta mark your territory girl, that's overkill
I was already head over heels from your appeal
Now forget the napkin, I'mma have to show my poet skills
Roses are red, uh
Violets are blue
I've never been in a fight but I'll be violent for you
Tried and I'm true
Why would I be lyin' to you?
Type of dime that caught the eye of every guy in my crew
Diamond for you
Next I'm in a tie and a suit
After I dropped to one knee like I was tyin' my shoe
Sayin' I do

[Hook]
Like a thousand explodin' suns
My heart burns you're the only one
They said the odds were a million to none
That I would finally discover the one
Someone to be my best friend and have fun
Ooh girl, you're makin' my Adrenalin run
I know our journey here's only begun
The job of loving you will never be done

[Verse 2]
Fast forward
Ten years later
Got a couple princesses and a young pro skater
Could've waited but I went for it first night
Got ya fat, badges in the chat, MursHype
I'm the type to see what I wanna go for
When I first got you pregnant, didn't have the dough for it
But I hustled for it, just like Hov did
Now we got 3, but we got enough for 4 kids
I'm just kidding girl, you know I know we done with that
Tried to name all our kids after Thundercats
She wasn't havin' it, we settled on the X-Men
Now everyday is Comic-con with my best friends
Whole house full of weirdos
Plus she let my beard grow
If I haven't told you lately, lady you're my hero
My Spider-Gwen, my Wonder Woman, you're my Captain Marvel
My everything, my yesterday, today and tomorrow

[Hook]
Like a thousand explodin' suns
My heart burns you're the only one
They said the odds were a million to none
That I would finally discover the one
Someone to be my best friend and have fun
Ooh girl, you're makin' my Adrenalin run
I know our journey here's only begun
The job of loving you will never be done

[Bridge]
She loves me, but I love her more
Left the block and fell in love with the girl next door
She loves me, but I love her more
Left the block and fell in love with the girl next door
I said
She loves me, but I love her more
Left the block and fell in love with the girl next door
She loves me, but I love her more
Left the block and fell in love with the girl next door

[Verse 3]
Soon as I get home from tour
She in a robe, naked at the front door
See-through silk with no drawers, from the kitchen to the shower to the bedroom floor
Soon as I finished she was beggin' for more
Been waitin' two months, I was ready for war
And we be goin' at it so hardcore
'Till the kids come knockin' on the bedroom door

[Bridge 2]
She like California sunshine
I wrote a song for her one time
Everyday is like sunshine
I wrote this song for her one time
She like California sunshine
Wrote a song for her one time
Everyday is like sunshine
She say she even like my dope rhymes
