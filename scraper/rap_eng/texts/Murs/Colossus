[Intro]
One time for the D-boys
Two times for the decoys
Three strikes never bring joy
Fourth time built to destroy
One time for the jail cell
Two times for crack sales
Three times for that West L
4-5 rest in peace, nigga free Mel

[Hook]
Hood nigga, hood nigga, I'm Colossus
(a hundred fifty grand in my Nike shoe boxes)
Hood nigga, hood nigga, I'm Colossus
(a hundred fifty grand in my Nike shoe boxes)
Hood nigga, hood nigga, I'm Colossus
(a hundred fifty grand in my Nike shoe boxes)
Hood nigga, hood nigga, I'm Colossus
(a hundred fifty grand in my Nike shoe boxes)

[Verse 1]
I'm 6'4" bench about five hundred
That's how I make the block run exactly how I want it
I stay stuntin' niggas hatin' but it won't stop
They hate to see a big nigga when he on top
Gucci flip-flops, bought 'em for some bops
Couple racks ain't shit but for them that's a lot
They sucking cock for a bottle of Ciroc
Let the homies run through him then it's back to the block
Niggas making drops in my momma mailbox
'Cause I'm serving everything from the pills to the rocks
On the porch in my crocs so I look like a square
The neighbors like to talk shi- do you think that I care?
I'm a fucking millionaire and I do it all cash
Tellin' Uncle Sam he can kiss my ass
They say "it won't last" but I'm almost thirty
And I keep my Jays clean but my money stay dirty

[Hook]
Hood nigga, hood nigga, I'm Colossus
(a hundred fifty grand in my Nike shoe boxes)
Hood nigga, hood nigga, I'm Colossus
(a hundred fifty grand in my Nike shoe boxes)
Hood nigga, hood nigga, I'm Colossus
(a hundred fifty grand in my Nike shoe boxes)
Hood nigga, hood nigga, I'm Colossus
(a hundred fifty grand in my Nike shoe boxes)

[Verse 2]
Bunch of orange boxes filled up with bank rolls
Money bring a lot of jealousy and stank hoes
But when you on you gotta treat it like cologne
It's the smell of success that you just can't clone
Make your fans tap your phone
Make a bitch nigga wanna put one in your dome
Even when I'm home gotta stay with the chrome
If a nigga try to creep I can peep him on my phone
Got cameras on the outside, hammers with me outside
Homies get nervous when they standin' with me outside
I understand I'm a fucking wanted man
Nigga pop me like I said that's a cool hundred grand
Used to be hand and hand, had a five year plan
Selling dope, but it ain't nothin' but a pyramid scam
It's only so long you can sit up at the top
So when I finally get shot, won't nobody be shocked

[Hook]
Hood nigga, hood nigga, I'm Colossus
(a hundred fifty grand in my Nike shoe boxes)
Hood nigga, hood nigga, I'm Colossus
(a hundred fifty grand in my Nike shoe boxes)
Hood nigga, hood nigga, I'm Colossus
(a hundred fifty grand in my Nike shoe boxes)
Hood nigga, hood nigga, I'm Colossus
(a hundred fifty grand in my Nike shoe boxes)
