[Verse 1: Murs]
Up for some fun
On the back of the bus
When I looked into her eyes
They were full up with lust
So we started to fuck
And then she went nuts
Said put your hands around my neck
And call me a slut
Oh what a rush I started to bust
But with my hands around her throat
She wasn't saying too much
Then she started to blush
Then she went blue
Then she went limp
I didn't know what to do

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Hey, let me find out Murs is fucking in the back room
I'm trying to get in here my brother it's past due
The homies in the front spilled jack and cashews
So, I need to slide in and grab back the vacuum
Got, no response, no acknowledgement, no reply
They're either drunk in the bottle or they're really high
It's seeming pretty quiet for a couple getting down
Ayo, Bern maybe you can say something to get em out

[Verse 3: Bernz]
I'm yelling "Fire" in the theatre
Broke glass, and pulled the lever
Everybody rushed the exits, while I sipped a margarita
Stuffed the body in a van, one-seater
And I'm out smoking reefer, for the meet-and-greeter
Cool as can be, we proceeded to ride
While the body started to rot
In the parking lot
This shit's crazy, it's insane
Deranged, no comprende
American horror story, I shot the presidente

[Verse 4: Murs]
Banging on table tops
Rocking our set
But in back of my mind
I don't know what to expect
My dick is still wet
Cuz i fucked her raw
But when I locked up the car
Man I swear that I saw
Naw it couldn't be that
Yeah I swear that she twitched
Now I’m lookin’ in the crowd
Yo is that that bitch
I'm hallucinating now
These two girls is making out
Wait, Are they biting or are they kissing?
Man, fuck it bro, I'm tripping

[Verse 5: Wrekonize]
I think we all might be slipping now
Off of our heads
Not really sure what's going on Shaun of the dead
But the venues all packed and the show is off the meter
Gonna take more than a zombie to make us shut off the speakers
So we rock, rock on trying to not let on that
There's a woman here who may no longer jock your john
As I start to gague why everybody's on the mainline
Bernz screams out to the crowd and stage dives

[Verse 6: Bernz]
Geronimo! Head first onto the crowd
They can't stop me, I'm an animal when music is loud
But what the fuck? Something bit me
These fans are getting shifty
I make them put me down, and see a zombie trying to lift me
Ain't no running, I'm boxed in, I'm fresh out of options
And now I'm a hostage, what the fuck is this garbage?
Momma never told me there'd be nights like these
Zombies tryna turn me into fresh veggies
I aay a quick prayer before I let it fall to the seas
Will we all make it out of these Apocalyptic scenes?

[Verse 7: Murs]
We made it out, but barely bro
The zombies killed Scenario
These motherfuckers chasing us
They hungrier than Terio
Bernz is infected
No idea where Wreck went
I'm about to run to CVS
For Zombie disinfectant
Better yet man
I got a plan to save the world
All of this got started
Because i had to fuck that crazy girl
Gotta find that chick
Bust a nut up in Her raw
Then my sperm will cure the virus
Man my dick is gonna save us all

[Verse 8: Wrekonize]
Man Stop fucking everybody god
You slashing every rabid fan but that don't work at all
Police sirens in the distance and we're separated
I'm yelling loud to figure out who isn't medicated
I'm fighting now to get back to my team this is a terrible dream it's all crazy obscene, I see Bernz and I scream
I tell him we gon need an exit and some antidote
I can't wait to get free and see some Jack and Coke

[Verse 9: Bernz]
Is there a heaven for a rock star?
Or am I the first to walk the Earth without these pass cards?
I'm just a zombie trying to kill the public at large
They tried to stick me in a bunker, turn the lights off
But I escaped, paced the back of the lounge and waited for brain
And by coincidence, the rest of ¡MURSDAY! got in the way
Chomp-chomp motherfucker, now we all undead
We the zombies on 7th and we eating the flesh!
