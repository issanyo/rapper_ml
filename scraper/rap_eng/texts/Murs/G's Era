[Verse One: Jabee]
Hope you noticed, just trying to stay focused
No hocus pocus tricks, just trying to stay potent
Floating in and out, this is how we do it
Money don't make the man and then just face the music
Lace it
Just trying to get this work off the streets
Base it
Trying to get some work I can keep
Face it
Everybody purp' off the streets
Satan got a hold from lukewarm to cold
Said he'd rather hold his pistol than silver and gold
Forever where it sits, better innocent
For never giving it to the Blood and the Crips
I'm safe in any hood, safe on any strip
My generation penetrates the nation with a clip
The grip, the handle, the trigger, the barrel
I grew up and I grew around the gang bang era
Living through that man I can prolly live forever
What's up?

[Hook: Jabee] {x2}
I'm somewhere in between Nas and Eazy-E
I'm somewhere in between Mos Def and Pimp C
I'm somewhere in between L.A. and N.Y.C
No matter where you from just consider me a G

[Verse Two: Murs]
Look, I'm from where the police come before the ambulance
The only come up was sports and moving hand to hand
I wanted blue Dickies moms bought me Hammer pants
My homies Crip walked, I did the Hammer dance
Too Legit though, mentality to get doe
See you with my homies and they ask, "Is you a Crip bro?"
Use to sell drugs, get buzzed with the brothers
But I really wasn't with us all killing one another
So I did the math, totaled all the sums
To me enemies with guns wasn't making no funds
And they wasn't having fun plus they wasn't getting none
And all the fly chicks wasn't messing with them bums
Read a couple books, wrote a couple rhymes
Some went ahead as crooks and did a couple crimes
Now I'm writing letters to my friends doing time
And I could've been them so I guess I'm doing fine
Talking to the little homie saying, "Keep your nose clean."
Chill with them pills, kick back with the codeine
You can't be a kingpin acting like a dope fiend
This street life is short you can blink and miss the whole thing
