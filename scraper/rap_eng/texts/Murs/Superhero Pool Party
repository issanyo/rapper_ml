[Intro: Murs & Bishop]
Bishop can I tell you a story for night night
Yea, okay
What do you want the story to be about
Umm I don't know
Can I tell you about the time papa had a superhero pool party
Yeah
Okay, are you ready?
Yeah
Whos your favorite superhero?
Black Panther and Spiderman
They weren't invited, fuck them

[Verse 1]:
Superman just broke the diving board
Rugrats fighting with the baby from the Dinosaurs
Not the mama, Hook brought the drama
'Cause Rufio and Lost Boys fucking up some commas
Back To The Future, Marty and Doc Brown
Cursing Kanye 'cause he brought the Nike stock down
Soundwave tripping, he ain't nothing but a artifact
People buying vinyl but cassettes ain't coming back
Speaking of comebacks, I just saw Voltron
Rolling with the Thundercats, getting their smoke on
He passed the joint over to DJ Lance Rock
Who had his boombox bumping Welcome to Jamrock
Black Lightning came through with Static Shock
Talking bout they the comic book Biggie and Pac
I said shut the fuck up, where T'Challa and Storm go?
He said they in the bathroom making a porno

[Chorus]
S to the U to the P-E-R
Too many bad guys at the bar
So the H to the E-R-O-E-S
Had to find another place to have a turn-up fest
I said a 3 to the 2 and 2 to the 1
Who said the good guys can't have fun?
1 to the 2 and 2 to the 3
We 'bout to have a superhero pool party

[Verse 2]:
Wonder Woman rolled up with her girl Jean Grey
With some shitty-ass bean dip from Frito-Lay
She-Hulk saved the day with some bomb guacamole
Same color as her skin, with a plate of ravioli
Outta nowhere, Flash came and ate the whole plate
When I went to swing on him, he vanished without a trace
Iron Man pissed, he always been a foody
I said don't be mad, Marvel makes better movies
He was drinking with Starfire, trying to take her shirt off
I had to kick him out because he was being a jerk off
Then I heard a sound I never heard before
Like the whole house now was on the verge of war
Hulk was in the front yard fucking with Thor
Good thing I hired Wolverine to work at the door
I told 'em both to shut the fuck up, come in and have cupcakes
Just one night without fights for fucks sake

[Chorus]
S to the U to the P-E-R
Too many bad guys at the bar
So the H to the E-R-O-E-S
Had to find another place to have a turn-up fest
I said a 3 to the 2 and 2 to the 1
Who said the good guys can't have fun?
1 to the 2 a 2 to the 3
We 'bout to have and superhero pool party

[Verse 3]:
I told Batman no capes in the pool
And Catwoman tried to steal all my Infinity jewels
Look jewels, gems, I really don't give a fuck
Professor X fell out his wheelchair, nobody picked him up
Aquaman asked me if he needed a hand
Popeye was trying to smoke all of his green out a can
Swamp Thing was 'shrooming with the Animal Man
And the Ninja Turtles just robbed the pizza man
Somebody told Shield and they sent Maria Hill
To investigate the Domino's crime
Now Starfire's topless and I can't stop it
But the Titans say she do it all the time
Johnny Blaze told Johnny Storm that he was more litty
I told both niggas that they wasn't fucking with me
Why you think Starfire keep pulling out her titties?
'Cause I got the hottest pool party in the fucking city

[Outro: Murs & Bishop]
Spiderman was the best, because everyone liked him
When I tell him, everybody
But Bishop, Spiderman's not in my story
Yeah?
Yeah, I left him out, 'cause fuck Spiderman
Did Black Panther come?
Fuck Black Panther and Spiderman
