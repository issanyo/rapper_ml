[Verse 1: Himself]
See, staying on top of it all ain't no easy shit
Please believe me when I say these fools will turn on you quick
I've learned to say okay and argue with a motherfucker for shit
I don't have time for yellin' and carrying on
I just sit back and be quiet
With the satisfaction of knowing you were wrong
You see I've grown a whole lot and you have to learn fast
There's a place where a person will stab you in the back
And take everything that you have

[Verse 2: Anacron]
I only spent eleven days at school in the eleventh grade
I never stayed
I was over the fence, learning in several ways
Experiencing experience
And I hold no regrets
Because I roll with the best scores on life's little test
While building bad progress reports in a shade by the tree
You got A's constantly?
Well that ain't bomb to me
Cause there are valedictorians who can't function in society
Or coherently tell me the price of deez (motherfucker deez)

[Verse 3: Murs]
I obtain life lessons, mix messages daily
When I think I understand, the contradictions drive me crazy
I see my mother suffer abuse from multiple men
I seen the same woman get right back up
With the courage to love a man again
From my observations, I can see I know nothing
Except that I'm gonna die and before that comes some sufferin'
But once you except death it helps to ease the sufferin'

[Hook: Himself]
I've learned to love and I've learned to hate
I've learned when to be in a rush and when to wait
I've learned when to disassociated and when to relate
I've learned a whole lot in my life along the way
I've learned when to frown up and when to smile
I've learned when to be humble and when to be wild
I've learned when to be quiet and when to be loud
These are hard life lessons learned since I was a child

[Verse 4: Anacron]
I've learned that learning pays
I've learned in many ways
I've learned that the mind is a terrible thing to waste
I've learned to say what I want to say
I've learned the instruments I play
I've learned to love and not lay
I've learned the error of my ways
And I've learned my lesson
I've learned to become wise
I've learned that gals love to get fucked as much as guys
I've learned that if you play with fire you gonna get burned
I've learned and lived
I've learned and learned

[Verse 5: Murs]
I need some help dude
A phrase we hate sayin'
But it helps you lighten your load and make it through the days
And I know you got your pride
But look
Put it to the side
Let your homies play they part
It never is a burden when they give it from the heart
And when you on your feet you give it back in return
And that's the only way the title +Pal+ can get earned
A lesson that I learned that I'd like to pass on
Cause we all need assistance
Ain't nobody that strong

[Verse 6: Himself]
In life I've realized that people like to lie a lot
To people gettin' upset
I drink and smoke private stock
People playin' both ends against the middle
Tryin' to tie a knot
Jealously and envy are both reasons people die a lot
Stressin' over shit that ain't even worth worrying about
Can't even have a good time when you go out
Life is fucked up, but hell what are you gonna do?
I got to many fuckin' problems to be worrying about 'em too

[Hook: Himself]
I've learned to love and I've learned to hate
I've learned when to be in a rush and when to wait
I've learned when to disassociated and when to relate
I've learned a whole lot in my life along the way
I've learned when to frown up and when to smile
I've learned when to be humble and when to be wild
I've learned when to be quiet and when to be loud
These are hard life lessons I learned since I was a child
