[Intro/Sampled refrain]
West coast cinderella...

[Verse 1]

Now let me tell you 'bout this girl I know
Pretty little something with a heart of gold
Her name was Cindy, she was destined to great things
I'll start the story of when she was 'bout eighteen
She lived in this little house south of Arlington
Right at the bottom of the hill where the harlem's is
Three room
Mates, they gave her hell
Well they was sisters but you really cound't tell, cause
They would yell at her, would clown her
Nothing good to say whenever they around her
They Sat around all day and did nothing
Had two jobs, get pregnant and fucking
Wellfare queens who tought they slick
They tought they had a maid living of the week
They were just so mean, made her work double shifts at the crisp cream
So fed up she wanted to kick and scream
But she helded all in like Listerine
And it burned like so much venom in a mouth
But if she spoke up they probably kick her out
See, they had the same damn daddy, she had the different one
Momma was a victim of the old Hit & Run
Treated them like gold, tretad her like whatever
But Cindy kept hope that things will get better
Prayed every day for a miracle to come
Is amazing how beautiful a spirit had become
She dind't blend in to give in to the wackness
Stayed positive and that made her attractive
And that attracted a man she deserved
Handsome little devil with a heart like hers
He wasn't rich or drivin' a Bentley
It seemed like things were looking up for Cindy
I know you feeling like the world is against you
Hurt so deep you don't wanna continue

[Chorus]

Ain't nothing but a west coast cinderella

You felling low me, no one to deffend you
Hold your head high baby I believe in you


[Verse 2]

The sisters tried to hate, they wanted to date him too
Everytime he come trough they say "Hey boo"
But he never feel bored, he was thick to the game
Never had he seen three chicks so lame
And the mother shows up, ploting and scheming
Been the one resent for a sinfull demons
Sittin he was dreaming about the house and the kids
But her mother came trough and guess what she did
She played sick so she needed a help
And Cindy had no time for a man overselves
So he said "let's take care of her togheter, I'll stay by your side till your mother get better"
But that didn't work no injest wouldn't do
Her mother dind't want her dream to come true
Moma got well and Cindy moved out
So she sent the three sisters over to the house
Her man was gone when the girls came over
They jumped her and putted Cindy in a coma
For three weeks she layed silent in the bed
Her man prayed everyday that she wasn't dead
He sat by side with some books that he read
One day spoke to her and this is what he said
"I know you've been struggling alone forever
But comeback to me and I swear I'll make it better"
With that her eyes opened and then she smiled
Cried a little bit and they prayed for a while
They stop fighting and gave it over to god
Soon her sisters got caught up for wellfare fraud
Her mama Locked up for selling weed on the side
Now there's nothing but love on the house she reside
Putted all behind and they started a new chapter
Now Cinderella lives happly ever after

[Chorus]

Ain't nothing but a west coast cinderella
