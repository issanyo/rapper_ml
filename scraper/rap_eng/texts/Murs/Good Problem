[Verse One: Murs]
I paid too much for my Benz (that's a good problem)
I got a gang of new friends (that's a good problem)
I can't go out to the mall (that's a good problem)
I never sounded like y'all (that's a good problem)

I had a nine with a clip cause I had hood problems
Waited on him to trip so that I could pop him
Fuck the drama, moved on to the next chapter
What I look like, catching cases like your favorite rapper?
Peep George Lopez, I'm working on my Letterman
Rolling solo with a K, call me letter man
The fliest bitches want to wear my letter man
She left you to be with me cause you let her man
I'm living for the moment, forgiving my opponents
Fuck the wait and go and get it if you really want it
Pussy's pose for press but they ain't getting richer
I'm like fuck y'all, pay me, no pictures

[Hook]
No time for cameras we'll use our eyes instead
No time for cameras we'll be done when we're dead
No time for cameras we'll use our eyes instead
I see new flashes of gold

[Verse Two: Tassho Pearce]
Yo my whole life 'bout to change (that's a good problem)
Another day a new plane (that's a good problem)
I can't remember her name (that's a good problem)
Mo' money, mo' problems wish I could solve them

Break down each line, line for line, decode it
Even on a week's notice
What I leak? Dopeness
And now you're girl have these quotes in her mouth
She deep throat it
These rappers got no vision man, they need focus
Now in the streets, I might not have a big buzz
Always ready to settle any dust that I kick up
I might never be as local as Iz was
But when it's said and done, they gon' remember my shit brah
My favorite rapper told me that my shit is fresh
Now I can care less if them haters ain't impressed
Some artists made it from my city then they left
They must have forgot where they came from
I rep it to the death

[Hook]
No time for cameras we'll use our eyes instead
No time for cameras we'll be done when we're dead
No time for cameras we'll use our eyes instead
I see new flashes of gold

[Verse Three: Omega Cix]
This beat is nasty as shit (that's a good problem)
My homie is murdering it (that's a good problem)
And I ain't letting it live (that's a good problem)
So now it's carried by Cix (that's a good problem)

Throw them hands up
Hang 'em high
Crucify
Hammer Time
