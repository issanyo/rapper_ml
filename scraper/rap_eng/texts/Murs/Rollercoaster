[Hook] [x2]:
She's my
Roller coaster so I hold her tight
She says
"Take a ride"
So I
Hop inside

[Verse One] [Murs]:
She said she never did it before
So we did it before
She changed her mind, because she seemed unsure
Pure
Ecstasy I gave her my legacy
Woke up the next mornin', and you know what she said to me?
"We only fuck. You don't really love me
We never make love and that makes me feel ugly
You push and you shove me, you pull my hair
Grab me around the throat then you choke me and stare."
You stare at me like you hate me, so do you?
That look in your eyes seems like I never knew you
Like every other week I receive the same speech
Cause she's feelin' guilty cause she really a freak
So when she's off to work, I'm makin' somethin' to eat
I sneak and put rose petals all over the sheets
Turn on some slow jams and we have simple sex
And the very next night we back to the triple X

[Hook] [x2]:
She's my
Roller coaster so I hold her tight
She says
"Take a ride"
So I
Hop inside

[Bridge]:
She puts her hands in the air
Like she's reachin' for clouds
But she won't sit down, cause she's screamin' so loud

[Verse Two] [2Mex]:
She's so hard to stay away from
My friends always say I'm dumb and that she's dangerous
But I'm so insane I trust my lust for her
Other girls are a lackluster blur
She wack, but I always end up thrustin' her
Against the wall
Fuckin' her should be against the law
The contradictions in her are the contradictions of us all
With that ADHD, I'm like, "Baby it's me
Can I ABC/see you out of that baby tee?"
There's no maybe G, she's fuckin' crazy
And that's the fuckin' trick, that we be fuckin' crazy
I'm losin' it
I'm think she's startin' to phase me
Every time I leave her she looks at me like, "Save me."

[Hook] [x2]:

[Bridge]:
She puts her hands in the air
Like she's reachin' for clouds
But she won't sit down, cause she's screamin' so loud

[Verse Three] [Murs]:
She's got split personalities, she ruined my life
It's like I wifed one chick and got two for the price
I really wanna leave her but I thought about it like
If I wanna break up, then I gotta call her twice

[2Mex]:
She's bi-polar, bi-sexual and buy's me issues of my favorite comics
When my sinks dirty she buys me Comet
Whatever I need, homie, she's on it
A woman like this, is rarely seen like Hailey's Comet
But then she changes up, just like a Coin Star
Tell me we're not goin' far like I don't even know who you are
And this ain't workin' right
When last night she complimented me of how I was workin' it right
Damn Sybil
Always givin' me mixed signals
Do you wanna be single or do you wanna be under my wing
Go away
If you're really going to stay
Stop tellin' me you love me and don't in the same day

[Hook] [x2]:
She's my
Roller coaster so I hold her tight
She says
"Take a ride", so I
