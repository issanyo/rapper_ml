[Intro]
G is for Gentrify

[Verse 1]
Another beautiful day in mid-city LA
They rolled up, we popped him as he walked away
Pro game, man down, now all the neighbors standing round with they cameras out
Red team verse blue team
Been over thirty years it ain't a new thing
Another gun shot, another nigga died
Don't you know we got a lot bigger fish to fry?
Up north they just lynch Willie Sims
How come y'all niggas ain't trying to get them?
Unless somebody come to try and take your rims
You gon' call the homies and pull out the MAC-10s
I don't understand y'all dudes
White people see it on the news and they confused
While you choose to make war in this bitch, they invest, buy land and get rich

[Hook]
They moved out, but we moved in
Like fuck y'all niggas, no new friends
When they move back, we gotta move out
Now it's seven figures for a new house
Walk they dogs with nose in the sky
Tensions build the temperature rise
We ask why the rent is so high
G-E-N-T-R-I-F-Y

[Interlude]
Ay, ay, could you put that camera down?
Y- what you mean it's a free country?
That's an expensive phone, right?
Yeah, it would suck if it got broke

[Verse 2]
Snapchat filters on the homicide
It's entertainment to them when one of us die
Wanted to hit 'em but I saw the big picture
If I hit 'em then I'm just an "angry nigga"
Covered up his phone with my hand
Try to reason with him like a grown man
He didn't get it but he left because he feared me
Couple days later he won't even come near me
At night I saw him way across the street
Walking his dog, when he stopped to take a leak
On the corner with the candles and the flowers
The homie mama she been standing there for hours
Every night she would come down to mourn and cry
She saw the disrespect out the corner of her eye
That's when a homie grabbed him by the neck
I would be a snitch if I said what happened next

[Hook]
They moved out, but we moved in
Like fuck y'all niggas, no new friends
When they move back, we gotta move out
Now it's seven figures for a new house
Walk they dogs with nose in the sky
Tensions build the temperature rise
We ask why the rent is so high
G-E-N-T-R-I-F-Y

[Outro]
Gentrify y'all, till we die y'all
From the West Side to best all y'all
It's gentrify y'all, till we die y'all
From the West Side to best all y'all
It's gentrify y'all, till we die y'all
From the West Side to best all y'all
It's gentrify y'all, till we, till we, till we...
