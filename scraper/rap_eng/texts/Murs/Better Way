[Verse 1]
In 89 they threw me under the water
In the name of the Holy Spirit, Son, and the Father
From this day forward I would always have a partner
Someone to lean on as the times got harder
But as the days got darker
I began to question everything I was a part of
Why the preacher always driving something so nice
And why the leader of the choir ain’t got no wife
So many things that didn’t flow right
The ones who loved the most high always be the lowlifes
So I expanded on my own route
Read The Final Call, saw what Farakah was talking bout
When I first quit pork it made my mother shout
Did miss pepperoni, yo no doubt
But I held strong, I was so devout
A little man trying figure it all out

[Hook]
I pray for love, I pray for peace
I pray for you, I pray for me
I pray for the living, I pray for the deceased
I pray for the people that’s living in the streets
I pray for my friends, pray for my enemies
I pray for free healthcare and clean energy
Cause this my prayer, I say it every day
I pray for patience while we working towards a better way

[Verse 2]
Been around the world, traveled many oceans
I kept a clear heart and my mind open
Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines
One with nature, one with the divine
Find your god, find your peace
Find your truth and your beliefs
Weather you believe in God or the tooth fairy
Bump Brother Ali or watch Tyler Perry
Me, I grew up inside the Baptist church
But I still do yoga because I think it works
I believe in ancient aliens and in Jesus
I believe in helping mother Earth cause she needs us
I believe in understanding and tolerance
I believe in government without the politics
I believe you shouldn’t place your faith in one man
And remember the creator has a master plan

[Hook]
