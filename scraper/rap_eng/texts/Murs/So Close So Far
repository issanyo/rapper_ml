[Verse 1: Murs]
Why would i hold a grudge against you
Or even pretend to I know it hurts your feelings
But its not like i meant to
Why would I offend you your the one that i'm in to
A queen so complex a king so simple
Two different types of affection
Life stay pulling us in different directions
Share the same roof but we losing affection
Saying Wi-Fi but we lacking that connection
We make up and keep it going
Every now and then we gotta reset the modem
Best friends still need to check in
And when i don't ask you about your day that's disrespecting
Truly neglecting playing Destiny 2
And its for you that i was destined
Waiting on tomorrow but tomorrow is today
And when tomorrow comes your already too far away

[Hook: Murs]
Feel so close, still so far apart
Coming real close, it might all fall apart
Cuz love takes work, that's on both of our parts
And when that love works its like a work of art

[Verse 2: Murs]
There she go there she go watch her shine
Its like god made a light that's all mine
I see you everyday but i don't tell you all the time
Sometimes you need distance to distinguish to divine
You kinda need that perspective
Our love is too pure for contrceptives
Remember when i text you that shit
Two week later you was pregnant as shit
Its a trip its been ten years
The same people with the same faults and same fears
But still i bring tears to your eyes
I should know you well enough that i should never make you cry
And sometimes it gets so bad you should know me well enough
That you should never make me mad
Its sad that when we give each other the blues
But as long as we fighting for love we never lose

[Hook: Murs]
Feel so close, still so far apart
Coming real close, it might all fall apart
Cuz love takes work, that's on both of our parts
And when that love works its like a work of art

[Outro]
So close, so far
Sometimes we can get real close to falling apart
Love takes work but when our love works
I just want to be your work of art
So close, so far
Sometimes we can get real close to falling apart
Love takes work but when our love works
I just want to be your work of art
