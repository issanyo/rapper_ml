[Verse 1: Murs]
It's like damn, why it take me so long to see?
That your tramp ass never was good enough for me
No tears in my eyes since I walked through that doorway
For three long years we did things your way
And now it's my turn to find me that good love
Cause you the type of broad nobody else could love
Let's be honest, we just got comfortable
This whole thing between us shouldn'tve lasted but a month or two
So why you all sad? Now it's time for me to cope
You had some flings on the side, I already know
Yeah it hurt, cause I never did you dirty
I did everything I could trynna make this work
So I could walk away from this with a clear conscience
You could miss me with them tears and that nonsense
Wonder I'm acting so nonchalant
Cause I feel nothing for you, I don't even have to front

[Verse 2: Balance]
We started as a fling, grew to a thing
I wanted out, you wanted a ring
I move in, cause you said no
More putting out if you ain't putting in dough
Pull me along, I move slow
Break up to make up, every month or so
Back-and-forth fighting, I stop writing
You stop calling, then you back balling
Eyes blush shot red, we make up, falling
In the same shit we was in before morning
But, you say it's love, I don't think so
So, hard to think when the red low
Everyday problem, ain't no solving
We ain't moving, time keep revolving
This ain't evolving, we need to stop
If love is a weapon then yo ass got shot
