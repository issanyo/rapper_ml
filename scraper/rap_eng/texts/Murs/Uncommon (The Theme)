[Verse 1: Anacron]
I rip clout with the sick shit out my big mouth
Get crowds jumpin' like they was tricked out
Endowed with loud beats, that make your ribs pound
This how I get down with Murs and Him now
Bend down in style without the Guin stout
And digged out gear just to stick my end out
Nigs bout to get rowdy and pout and dish out
Without the clip now we out like click pow

[Verse 2: Himself, Murs and Anacron]
How'd you think we could quit?
Man, we still on that shit
Rapping all day at the house
The only difference now is that we don't have to ditch
The perfect war machine built without a glitch
Or an imperfection, see we're perfectionists
Perfected this shit, climb the underground charts
Netherworlds is a hit, never miss when we swingin'
Together with the Nether, Cuz the real world ain't ready for the shit that we bringin'

[Verse 3: Murs]
I can hit the floor and C-Walk or the half pipe and skate
Now some may say that a young black male can't posses both traits
I know how to load a nine with the edge of my shirt so the prints can't be traced
Varsity badminton, know how to move weight
Crewnshaw's for the summer, Cancun for the break
Split personalities too much for y'all to take
Cuz when I keep it true y'all keep sayin' that I'm fake

[Verse 4: Anacron and Himself]
Ain't you ever heard some fresh rhymes
The def kind, that will stop time
Stop then rewind
Leaving other crews behind with yield signs
With their feelings hurt while our trio feels fine
Lines fall into place
Y'all inthralled by the bass
Peep my mind over beats that put it all in your face
Do a show then disappear without a trace
When you consume this tape you ought to say grace

[Verse 5: Himself]
If you really wanna do this we can do this fam
But don't fuck with NTDub were not your usual men
I scream on the mic with a passion you not accustomed to
All barriers that are set up fool, I'm busting through
With a throttle to the floor, a joint in the hand, and a bottle in the door
Driving crazy over three lanes
I ain't been home in three days
Heading north doing 95 on the Freeway
Flashing my high beams and honking at the truck
Its Murs, Himself and Anacron
We not your common motherfuckaaasss.....

(Break)

Me and two of my cohorts
Back in the days of Hamilton's court yard
Where everybody was trying to act so hard
We was rapping about how dope niggas flows are
It was frequent to our trips to Taco Bell
That gave us the time to learn to rock so well
I swear we freestyle'd everyday for five years straight
Serving fools made us who niggas love to hate
But fuck that I'm a fool who struck back
Eat your ass then ask your friends where the bud at?
Go up in your crib with dirty shoes and leave mud tracks
Will never be disrespected you can cut that

[Verse 6: Murs]
Oh my goodness, could this be the promised land?
Gin and tonic in my hand
Selling chronic to my fans in the form of CDs
Trying to spread love, instead of making enemies

[Verse 7: Anacron]
I hit streets with big beats to make ends meet
And ignore these phony busters that claim to have beef
Marks hating on me to get more rep
Like dominos I bring some nasty shit to your doorstep
And its like that nigga and you better not forget
The Netherworlds is treating fools like ? Springer guests
Booo, slut slut slut
Netherworlds up in the cut
Motherfucker what
