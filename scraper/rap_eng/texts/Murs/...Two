[Verse 1: Anacron]
This shit is sick, nasty, hella ugly, close to grody
I'm only the bony brother to boldly box up your homies
You know me I, wanna fuck Kobe Tai
She so fly
If we meet I hope she like black guys
That got hot creole blood in their veins
And a strain of DNA
To play a role in BMA
Likable dude, Im reciting a few lines
To remind fools in due time
They'll get chewed up and spit out like recyclable food

[Verse 2: Himself]
Every time I leave the crib I get harassed by the cops
Waiting for a richer stop, walking fast up the block
Strolling past women who like to show their ass a lot
Everybody has a glass of something because its hot
It's summer in the city baby t's and short skirts
100 degrees, fools taking off their T-shirts
I'm trying to sell CDs while these fools work
Netherworlds hustling, nigga, 'till it hurts

[Murs]
A mic strung upside down for a left handed genius
Actually, I'm right handed but ? is the cleanest
Netherworlds eclipse the rap game, I know you had to see us
Sweetest shit up out the hive, I know you drones wanna be us
This buzz that we created to make y'all some true believers
Call us three wise men, this album baby Jesus
Please believe us
