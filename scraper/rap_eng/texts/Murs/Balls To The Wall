Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry

[Verse 1: Murs]
Independence? Shit y'all don't know what that means
Man I been serving, slanging tapes since I was only fifteen
All my label on my masters
Industry? Fuck them bastards
You an Emcee? Be a rapper
Destiny, I'm the master
You a slave getting pimped
Hoin' just to pay the rent
Frontin' like you on your own
Rockin' songs that 12 inch
Or maybe even MCA's subsidiaries don't get paid
I mean no cheese with all them logos on your album cover? Please

[Verse 2: Anacron]
Now I got ho's in expensive clothes purchased overseas
Dough and I'm spending those working with my G's
Independent businessman rapping for a fee, Fool
Beats and CD's got us bangin' tax free

[Verse 3: Himself]
And if you ask me Independent artists run the nation
Press albums, no stipulations or regulations
Don't have to worry about changed release dates
Just hit the streets and slang your own fucking tapes

[Verse 4: Anacron]
What? Dude, fuck the Industry because the paychecks are a joke
I'm set with hella options fool I'll never die broke
I'm getting scrilla from the pretty bitches that I poke
And Loc, I make papes at the clubs I promote

[Verse 5: Himself]
And I'll be slanging tapes plus baggies of that green dope
And if you don't want a tape then I'll sell you some weed to smoke
I know how it is when you wanna get high and choke
Either way it goes at the end of the night, I won't be broke

[Hook]
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry

[Verse 6: Himself]
My vote is that everyone who's signed to a major
Hit the top floor and up strap and demand your paper
And if you don't get royalties, you better get 'em guys
Even if they pay you a million bucks you're still getting victimized

[Verse 7: Anacron]
And hypnotized by the corporate leech
Snatched up by your nuts, tied up to a leash
While we reach peaks only seen on dreamscapes
Filling record crates with our intricate speech

[Verse 8: Himself]
See Imma ball till I fall
And fuck the Industry
The only labels you'll see me fucking with are indy
Consumer friendly, where sixteen thou is a good sale
Don't have to go double platinum to do well

[Verse 9: Anacron]
As do we swell up
Fuck what you tell us
Haters be jealous
Cuz they Poor
While I'm big ballin' off of these few new songs
I peep the pay check like
"Hey hey thats a good one"

[Verse 10: Murs]
You claiming independent when your ass is just a fucking joke
Waste your fans money when you buying weed and fucking coke
Buy some new shoes and now your ass is dead fucking broke
Will you ever see a Living Legend goin out like that? Nope
Cuz I'm a hustlin' hustlin', stage crushin', money makin', motherfucker
How you supposed to fight the cops, when yo ass is just a buster
Dissin' white folks and them the only fans you can muster
Less you ?
Get it right
Skip the hate, Get it straight
Cuz we all know that the state is the illest enemy
And imma ball till I fall
Fuck the Industry

[Hook]
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry
Well Imma ball till I fall fuck the Industry

[Scratching sample]
