[Hook: Murs] {x2}
The style is intergalactic
Not for the radio but radioactive
It's for the white and the black kids
The Latin, Asian, Native kids that's playin' this rap shit

[Verse One: Rapsody]
Adverse as them artists that's over the industry
Fucked up deals celebrated with Hennessy
I'm strong with the Force I ain't feelin' your energy
Shady politics, I leave all that to them Kennedys
Blow 'em off, Kenny G, too advanced for you mentally
I've been takin' note of how you hold niggas for centuries
Jedi
Fuck the Dark Side
You fake as enemy
Swear you word is your bond, more like penitentiaries
I ain't fakin' with you fuckers
Came prepared with no rubbers
Saw what it did to Lauryn so I know you don't love her
And to the rest of you suckers, don't support us like Chuckers
Revolutionary, but you show no love to your brothers
I see ya
Disheartening, I pray for you people
Artist verses industry and niggas this is the sequel
Jedi, returning of
For everything that it was
For every artist like us
Salute and show us love

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Murs]
I'm interstellar
You're only intermediate
I dropped that style awhile ago, I don't know what you see in it
I'm into free and shit, being uninhibited
You are from a sector where the Jedi are prohibited
You are just a gimmick kid
I am what authentic is
The proof is in the traces of the blood left in my penmanship
You are Reptar
I am the Death Star
You can flee, I can guarantee that you will not get far
We only travel by Millennium Falcon
It's Murs and Rapsody so you knowin' the outcome
It's like Malcolm meets Angela Davis
Rewriting history to put our names in the pages
