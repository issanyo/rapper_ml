[Verse 1]
Half Mexican and Salvi
The perfect girl from Cali
Met her at a party in Van Nuys in the valley
She said her name was Leti, that's short for Leticia
I said my name is Nick, quite a pleasure to be meetin' ya
Perhaps if you have the time, I wouldn't mind treatin' ya
To dinner and a movie because I really wanna be with ya
She giggled just a little, put her number in my phone
I text a little later to make sure she made it home

[Pre-Hook 1]
Mi corazón te pertenece
I don’t care what your friend say
Estas siempre en mi mente
So I can’t let you get away
Que me traes buena suerte
I need to be with you like everyday
Yo lucho hasta la muerte
Busting shots with my AK

[Hook] (x2)
Oh, mi corazón
Soy la única para tí
Tell me that you're never gonna leave me

[Verse 2]
She was half Salvadorian, the perfect Californian
I picked her up and dropped back off at her door at ten
Now I'm walking back to my car all cool
And I heard a voice say "Who the fuck are you?"
I said "Man, you just seen me drop Leti off"
He balled up his fist acting like he 'bout to set it off
His homie rolled up, looking just like him
And just when I thought I was about to fight them (whoop!)
That's when the cops rolled up
Smelling like some sausage and coffee and donuts
But I'm happy that they saved me because it could of got crazy
That's when Leti texted me saying "I love you baby"

[Pre-Hook 2]
Me vuelves loco
But you act like you don't know though
Estoy obsesionado un poco
I’m always looking at your photos
Esa mirada en tus ojos
Can’t believe that you wore those
Ahora estas en peligro
You better never leave me solo

[Hook] (x2)
Oh, mi corazón
Soy la única para tí
Tell me that you're never gonna leave me

[Bridge]
How could it ever work, she was brown and I was black
Went to her crib and her brothers pulled a strap
She sent me pictures of her ass so fat
Now I'm thinking "damn, I gotta go back"

[Hook] (x2)
Oh, mi corazón
Soy la única para tí
Tell me that you're never gonna leave me
