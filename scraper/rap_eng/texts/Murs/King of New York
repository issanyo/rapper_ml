[intro: Murs][spoken]
The monarch of the metropolis
I sit on a throne made of asphalt and concrete
Grill from the steel
And my breath smell like the J train
Fuck is up?

[Verse 1: Murs]
Three stripes on the crown and a nike swoosh
Megalomaniac and a slight recluse
Let loose with the freak show
The whole city move fast but i speak slow
Doing pull ups at the stop light
Drinkin 40s on the stoop on a hot night
Killed a cracker on the block and I got life
Came back resurrected - hop life
Get money get fame get your name in lights
But make sure I get credit if the game is tight
Right hand to my heart I made a black man president with my art
Started off as a dream
Moved up north put coffee in the cream
Caffeine in the mainline
What the fuck you mean that the city ain't mine

[Hook]
(he's slow fly, he's so fresh)
Huh, yeah. I'm the king of New York nigga
I'm the king of New York, nigga
(he's so fly he's so fresh)
I'm the king of New York
Fuck you mean I'm the king of New York

[Verse 2: Murs]
Fuck Giuliani fuck Bloomberg
The tourists come to see me not you herb
I put the shine in the concrete
I'm the only reason that there's cops on the beat
I'm the rhythm of this whole shit
Nicky Barnes hit the city with a whole brick
Son of Baldwin and Zora Neale
Let me see your 120 show me that it's real
From tk to freebase
My name dominate our whole weight in each state
The new moves I originate
Then turn on the tv and watch them all emulate
I demonstrate moving down the interstate
Then I talk shit cause you caught on a minute late
Arrogant everybody owes me something
Without me you niggas wouldn't own nothing

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Murs]
All a y'all should bow down and suck my dick
What? no homo? fuck that shit
Ain't nobody comin out till I'm ready
Shout out to Zulu and the Rocksteady
I'm so heavy in these streets
I'm the whole reason that yall muthafuckas eat
Styles I create make sure you stay fed
Put me up in Times Square watch them all break bread
Big daddy gave birth to the nation
The gods and the earths Dominicans and Haitians
There's so much culture in these veins
It's no wonder that I've gone insane
But I must maintain
Can't have these lames fucking up the game
It ain't about supreme or your white boy jeans
Without my stamp then it don't mean a thing

[Hook]

Y'all muthafuckas can have wall street and downtown
I've got you muthafuckas surrounded
You gotta either go out thru jersey you gotta go out through the bronx
You gotta go through me to get where you need to go

[Verse 4]
It was a long time ago as I remember
A freezing afternoon back in december
So there seems to be a man standing in the bank lobby
No shoes on his feet like it was his hobby
Kept on walkin
Didn't think twice
Then I turned around sucka standing on ice
His toes was curly sticking in the air
And a smile on his face like he did not care
He goes by the name or Mr. 14th Street
Straight funky cold fresh just like this beat
Haha
