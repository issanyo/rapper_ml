Go [x9]

Chorus: [x9]
Go
On and on

Verse One [MURS]
I grab the mic like my name was on it
And spit the fly game to get the ladies goin'
I'm a superfly southern California MC
Makin' earthquakes shake and shape destiny

[Slug]
I'm like X, Y & Z
I stick by the back door
Let it go free, that's what the track's for
My jobbie job is to rock a party
Taught your mommy to karaoke La Di Da Di

[MURS]
We blowin' up
But the flow is so rough
That the mainstream suckers won't notice us
But so what?
Who gives a damn?
Bout to change the whole world with this mic in my hand

[Slug]
Yeah
Make you stand up
Big and tall
Pitch the ball
And I promise I'mma hit it y'all
And when it falls
I'll be around the bases
My clothes in a suitcase
My phone and some toothpaste

[MURS]
This is my life

[Slug]
I'm runnin' this show

[MURS]
Everybody in the place just loose control!

Chorus

[Slug]
Turn out the lights

[MURS]
So we can see y'all glow

[Slug]
Throw your hands in the air if you know you got soul!

Chorus

[Slug]
And it grows
And it builds
Until it kills from the pills, bills and drum fills
Free wheels
Spins or sit still
Everybody just wanna feel somethin' real

[MURS]
Deep down, we reach down to touch clowns
How to rip it, how to rock it when the beat pounds
Sweet sounds, burnin' right through the speaker
While I'm lookin' for a chick in nice jeans and tight sneakers

[Slug]
We the kings of
Fuckin' your queens up
You can mean mug
I just want the green stuff
Out in Boise
Set the voice free
Up in Omaha
We make 'em all noisy

[MURS]
Out in Utah
Bringin' you the truth y'all
Talkin' Salt Lake all the way to Sioux Falls
And while the fiends on the scene do nothing
We do damage and make it mean something

[Slug]
If you feel this shit

[MURS]
Put a smile on your face

[Slug]
Put your ass on the floor and burn down this place

Chorus

[MURS]
If you're filthy rich

[Slug]
Or your minimum wage

[MURS]
Let me hear you make some noise if you just got paid

Chorus

[MURS]
Now when the cops come
Tell them fools to stop frontin'
This is our world, y'all don't run nothing
Don't reach for your wallet cause you might get shot
Screamin' justice and peace till the casket drops

[Slug]
Huh, We can't stop
Huh, it's not an option
So put your hands up
You are now rockin' with the blessed
So make it messy
About to break the levee cause the party stays ready

[MURS]
Now if rich and famous
Or broke and seductive
MURS & Slug, the wrong crew for you to fuck with
Brainstorm couldn't hold the flow in buckets
My flash flood warnings
Don't press your luck kid

[Slug]
Uh huh, North American characters
When I'm on stage
It's in my nature to embarrass ya
The pair of us
Want to share the rush
Now put two up if you care too much
Now

[MURS]
I love my job

[Slug]
I'm puttin' in work

[MURS]
All the ladies in the crowd let me hear y'all flirt

Chorus

[Slug]
Felt don't stop

[MURS]
Diggin' up the dirt

[Slug]
Peace to anybody who's got a 2Pac shirt

Chorus
