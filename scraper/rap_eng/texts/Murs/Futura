[Verse 1: Himself]
One day
There will be a world without pain
A place where a stranger offers you a dry space out the rain
A place where people of different nationalities hang
Where it doesn't matter who you are as long as you on the same thang
A place where I hit the store and I don't get followed around
Where historical neighborhoods are treated as hollow ground
Where black folks are respected even if they not entertainers
Telling their live stories to strangers
A place where black folks know how to act
We can go to the movies without someone pulling a strap
Smoking glamorous marijuana
Never having to say, "Your honor, it wasn't me
I plead not guilty could you please set me free"
Honestly the future is gonna be something to see
Something to see, Something to see

[Verse 2: Murs ]
On the shores of Mexico
Sippin' tap water slow
Watchin' my kids grow
Speaking in Ebanish while they runnin' to and fro
And for y'all who don't know that's Spanish and Ebonics
If this rap game don't work then I'm growing hydroponic
Five years from now, man I just don't know
I just want to be alive and surrounded by some dough
Maybe own a doughnut shop
That doesn't serve cops
I know I'll still be hip hop
Kicking that graffiti rock
Hangin' out with my crew
Disney Land season pass
With a beautiful wife that don't wanna leave my ass
For reasons unknown
Probably cuz I couldn't keep my snake in its home
Hopefully I'm full blown
Have a Grammy and a throne
I'll buy my own island call it, "the Murs zone"
Legal age sixteen
"Do What The Fuck You Wanna Do" by Devin is the theme
Kicking back playing Tony Hawk tres, on a fat big screen

[Verse 3: Anacron]
On a fat big screen bitch, and it goes like this
Imma be in San Francisco, holding it down
B-boying six hours north of my home town
Composing hits where brisk air hits the sand
Transposing feelings to notation on music stands
Five bars and four spaces
Rewarded me in the places where by creation moves
Instrumental grooves
My wife will lounge close by in the tilt
A strong woman with a job and a fire that never wilts
Mother to the children that look just like me
Creole C's with dreads quietly posted on my knees
I coasted overseas
Gain fame in many regions
A west coast original with pitiful spiritual rituals
A regular on the national spoken word circuit
Me and ? will grab world wide and worked it
My life is simply perfect
Really it's weird its only been ten years
Since them cheers
Greeted Netherworlds on the stage at the forum a couple of years prior to the novus ordo seclorum and that shit was a trip
But since the gangsters was awake
The government was overthrown in a month and seven days
Now under a hazy bay sky
It's all gravy spending Fridays painting
And Sunday nights lazy in a robe and slippers talking to Murs long distance like, "dude I told you Shaq and them fools would lose to the championship to the Pistons, Sike!"
