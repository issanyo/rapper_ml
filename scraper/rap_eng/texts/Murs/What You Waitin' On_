Trayvon Martin
Latasha Harlins
Shot that little girl dead in the supermarket
They don’t give a fuck, they treat us like we’re targets
Kill a black kid, take the plea bargain
They livin' in fear of us so every interaction’s tense
So anything they do to us is self defense
We’re at war with a crooked ass police department
While we waitin' on the murderers to face charges

[Hook - Murs]
They got us waitin' on the government for welfare
Waitin' on a god that don’t fucking care
While we waitin' we won’t ever get a fair share
So what you waitin' on, what you waitin' on
Waitin' on a prophet while the people suffer
Waitin' on the courtrooms to bring us justice
While we waitin' we can take from these motherfuckers
What you waitin' on, what you waitin' on

[Murs]
We waitin' on the middle east to fire first
Waitin' on the north korean missle burst
No disrespect to iggy but she patty hearst
That’s word to god, that’s word to murs
We watchin' world star and youtube
Spending more on tennis shoes than we do on food
Shit is realer than a pimp c interview
While i’m waitin' on the truth to make sense to you

This motherfucker said he’s waitin' on the world to change
Couldn’t date a black girl - kinda strange
Is he a racist or just fucking lame?
Fuck john mayer with a dick full of cocaine
Wait a minute - ain’t that the same?
Hate for hate, makes us all insane
Divide and conquer is the oldest game
Why we waitin' on the president to make change?
