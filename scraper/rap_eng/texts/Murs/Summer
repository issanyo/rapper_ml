[Verse 1]
Six niggas in a G ride
Squadded up, headed to the East side
They try to clown 'cause we from West L.A
Them niggas think we boujie and we just for play
Got a AK
And a .38
Lower-Middle class niggas movin' up the murder rate
The other day they was talkin' real big
Caught me slippin' up the West field with my kid
At the bus stop, with my baby's mom
Tried to keep it cool
Said I didn't want no problems
They took off on me anyway
All I had was my hands and some pepper spray
My lady and my son had to run away
They should've killed me but I lived to fight another day
I know where they stay
I know where they be
Your best friend is your enemy's enemy
We pulled up
Got the drop on 'em
Them bitch niggas went and called the cops on us
We got pulled over 'bout a block away
They snatched the big homie, and took his AK

[Hook]
I can't wait 'till the Summer come
The big homie get another gun
Motherfuckers thought that they wanted some
Now we the niggas that they runnin' from
I can't wait 'till the summer come
The big homie get another gun
Motherfuckers thought that they wanted some
Now we the niggas that they runnin' from

[Verse 2]
Deuce-deuce in the chrome 4-5
These niggas talkin' peace but the beef won't die
You can find me in that chair, put the needle to my arm
'Fore I ever let another man do me harm
'Cause I remember
When they said that they was comin' for us
We kicked back and waited all summer for it
Them niggas had they chance
And now the big homie home, and yep
We got plans
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no Summer vacation
I'm talkin' bout fuckin' off my probation
I ain't talkin' 'bout Disney Land
I'm talkin' eight of us, deep in a mini-van
No volleyball, sun tans or surfboards
Just a bunch of niggas dead from a turf war
That's how my best friend missed his first tour
'Cause we act like our lives ain't worth more

[Hook]
I can't wait 'till the Summer come
The big homie get another gun
Motherfuckers thought that they wanted some
Now we the niggas that they runnin' from
I can't wait 'till the summer come
The big homie get another gun
Motherfuckers thought that they wanted some
Now we the niggas that they runnin' from
