She had them hips like, face like, ass like, dang
Tattoo on her neck said the neighborhood gang
Her man was from the hood they called him "Baby Insane"
Together forever, for years they been doin' they thang
So check it
I'm at the
I'm at the
I'm at the liquor sto'
She started hittin' on me, now I'm in an episode
Of Cheaters of Springer, whatever the drama
I said, "I know you got a man and I ain't fuckin' with the karma."
She said
"I'mma say we did. Even if I know we didn't
And I seen you lookin' at me. I know that you wanna hit it."
I admit it, guilty
You check my fingerprints
And I've been fuckin' with that gangsta bitch like ever since
