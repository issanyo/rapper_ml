[Intro] [Blueprint Speaking]
Yeah. No doubt. Uh huh

[Verse One] [Blueprint]
I'm not here to tell you I'm a thug
I'm not here to brag about the good life
While it's true I've been to many clubs
I can't even tell you what the V.I.P. looks like
But I can tell you what a crook likes
And what they look for at night so you don't get your jewels swiped
Because they look nice
And you look like the shook type
So you look right
Sometimes you gotta think like a criminal
And stay two steps ahead of dudes that might shit on you
You work hard then they get rich from you
Cut 'em off so they're not in a position to
The world is full of pimps and players
To sell you ice cream in all different flavors
From independent labels up to the majors
They like to come at you like they doin' you a favor
A lot of cats front like they soldiers but never held a gun
Much less had to point it
So even if they did see combat
The highest rank would be major disappointment
But never have I dropped the ball
I ran up in a spot, I rocked 'em all
Then all you saw was shock and awe
Cause everything I drop's the bomb

[Hook] [Blueprint] [x2]
They listenin'
They listen to this
They listenin'
They listen to this
They listenin'
They listen to this
They know who we are
They know where we live

[Verse Two] [MURS]
Now let me put you up on game
You and I are not the same
From the bad to the good, my neighborhood is to blame
You were raised by your TV
Sitcom's cheesy
Lucy, Ricky, George & Weezy
Monica, Chandler, Dillon, Brenda
Two parents and a dog who you all love tender
And it's not your fault that I got my ass beat
Fist fights after school, at least once every week
Not the kids in the class, man my moms whooped my ass
So if you popped off at recess your faced got smashed
Cause I harbored all that anger then directed it at strangers
Loved my momma for that shit and for my life I wouldn't change a
Taught me balance and option
Action and consequence
And this is what honesty and truth can do for confidence
But you ain't got no common sense
They babied and pampered you
Thought they were helping but all they did was hamper you
That's why I can't stand you dudes
Cause after all that was handed you
You throw it all away, like drunk bitches for a camera crew

[Hook] [Blueprint] [x2]
They listenin'
They listen to this
They listenin'
They listen to this
They listenin'
They listen to this
They know who we are
They know where we live

[Verse Three] [Manifest]
You talk about chips when you can barely afford a bag of Ruffles
I throw a muzzle on your yap to keep ya trap muffled
This is to my cohorts caught up in the cash clutch
Cause you seen that you need that green stack, get bucks
Then you wanna sit down for what you stand for
And when you don't get in get mad and demand more
I know you know the rules
Life don't owe you anything
You wanna sit back and complain about a shitty scene (heh)
But don't wanna add to the structure
Hard work maybe could've made you next brah
But instead you wanna blame, complain
You need to stay out cause the game has changed
All that talkin' you do young boy pause that
You need to talk to your broad first, get your balls back
Then maybe then
You can elevate
But you play the bitch role nigga, menstruate

They listenin'
They listen to this
