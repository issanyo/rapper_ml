[Verse 1: Murs]
Now this sounds like something that the kids
From the West Coast that jock the East Coast would like
So I guess that means that the kids from West
That jock the East Coast now jock me, psyche
How they all wanna sound like they from Detroit
If you ain't dope, homeboy, then what's the point?
You ain't breaking no ground, you ain't pushing no limits
Tryna shop yo deal off your mixtape image, ha
Fool, I write like Brian Michael Bendis
Impact left on the game: tremendous
No 12 inches, knowing nothing 'bout the game
Spitting freestyles and bob just to get fame
I'm not bitter, just a little nostalgic
‘Cause these MC's surviving '93? I doubt it
The name Murs but your girl call me hers
And I'm out this bitch with PH

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
I'm getting [?]
I wanna go to where the sun rises
In the morning
And say it ain't the same
Where the sun stands
And where I'm going

[Verse 2: Pumpkinhead]
Now this sounds like something that them kids
From the East Coast that sweat the West Coast would like
So I guess that means that them kids from the East
That's what the West now sweat means (right)
Everybody is a hipster—even the thugs now
They rocking technicolor flags—this shit is bugged out
I stay true to who I am and won't change
While metrosexual MC's is F'ing up the game
Y'all lame.  My aim is precise at y’all careers (say something)
I ride through your town like Paul Revere
All adhere to my verse while I'm spitting
My talent's in a box; yours doesn’t fit in
On some Hulk Hogan shit, I ate my vitamins
Deep like Leviathan, creeping through Ireland
Tryna win and get gold nuggets like Iverson
PH and Murs—shut the game down, try again

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
I wanna take you to
Over to where the sun sets
In the evening
Looking for something different
In my life
So I'm leaving, leaving
So ready to go wrong
And I'm leaving
Right now
