[Voice announcer]
You asked for it, you got it
And this is ("FELT") Volume 2
("Murs, Slug is a group, but Felt is the fabric")

[Slug]
Ay Murs, why you always look mad at at life?

[Murs]
First, fuck you for asking, cause you know that ain't right
I just refused to be plastic for these rappers I don't like

[Slug]
Well how do you manage to stay so polite?

[Murs]
Anger management technique, developed out of spite
Rather kill you with kindness than kill you in a fight

[Slug]
So why you wanna punch these other rappers in their face?

[Murs]
Cause they fake as fuck, and a waste of space
Besides, fist not guns, that's a change of pace

[Slug]
So who are you to judge who's true these days?

[Murs]
I been around the block, got a few dues paid
One of the few rappers left that'll do what I say

[Slug]
So is it Def Jux or the Living Legends that you're reppin'?

[Murs]
Man, I'm all about good music, people and progression
I got friends in different sections but the West is where I'm restin

[Slug]
Do you really think race is the reason you ain't sellin'?

[Murs]
What, you trying to piss me off and put a end to this session?
Man, you've heard This Is For - c'mon, next question

[Slug]
Aight, what was it like working with Humpty Hump?

[Murs]
One hell of a artist, but a fucking drunk
Though he did get the video cracking, I won't front

[Slug]
You had a bunch of porn stars there, anything jump?

[Murs]
Yeah, up into my lap for some head just once
And I could've got some pussy, but I was too fucked up

[Slug]
Hahaha, after the first "Felt", did you meet Christina?

[Murs]
No, she never said thanks, my black ass never seen her
That's why I moved on to my Nubian queen, heh

[Slug]
So what's the definition of the "3:16", huh?

[Murs]
It's my birthday, fool: 3-16
Plus the formula for the every rap song that you sing

[Murs]
Hey Slug, why you only make songs about women?

[Slug]
Priorities, man. Nah, I'm kiddin'
I'm trying to build heaven while the world's still spinnin'

[Murs]
How big did you guess it would get in the beginning?

[Slug]
This is still the beginning, still unraveling ribbon
The mission is to travel for as far as the vision

[Murs]
Well how long so you think this success will last?

[Slug]
Man, for all I know, that shit already passed!
It's impossible to answer that question asked

[Murs]
Then why Rhymesayers make a deal with Epitaph?

[Slug]
We didn't, you dumbass! Go read the math
Me and ANT did one record, for beats and laughs

[Murs]
Anyways Sean, whatever happened to Spawn?

[Slug]
Well things felt wrong, so we both had to move on
No love gone, every day holds a new dawn

[Murs]
Business and friendship: where's the line drawn?

[Slug]
Family and friends may get past the front lawn
Business is done by the end of the last song

[Murs]
Is it the caffeine, the nicotine, the milligrams, the tar?

[Slug]
No: it's Selena, it's Christina, it's Serena in my car
It's a thick line between being a genius and a star

[Murs]
Are you rapping, acting, or kittin the guitar?

[Slug]
Man, fuck that shit! I'm just sittin at the bar
Writing these hits about self-inflicted scars

[Murs]
Are you in love with this game, completely and truly?

[Slug]
From the music to the voice to the stage to the groupies
I'm the same as I was back when nobody knew me

[Murs]
Alright, who is Lucy?

[Slug]
She's the extra that gets to play the devil in my movie
She's around Uptown sipping a beer smoothie

[both burst out laughing]

YEAAAAH, HAHHHHH-HAHAHA
(We did it again!) WE DID IT AGAIN!
(TAKE THAT! Hahaha, another album!
Hahaha, THE JOKE'S ON YOU, JACK!!
