[Verse One] [Murs]:
I refuse to let these clowns win at any cost
I'm here to take the crown back and then I'm off
Crown meaning king, every king needs a crown
But I'm here to take it all, not just the underground
The mainstream is full of lames with backpacks
Heads filled up with cocaine and wack raps
Producers sitting in bedrooms with sad tracks
I lost the hair but I'm still on that abstract
I think the unthought, I teach the untaught
I ain't preaching, I'm just getting to the fun part
My girl is dumb smart, you girl is cool to smash
She got a crazy body, but she a stupid ass
I had this air head, she could always get it up
She gave me good brain, because it was dumb luck
I got a wife now, I used to do my fans
But I'm bugging out, back to the music man

[Scratch Hook] {X2}:
"S-K"
"I-B" - Shorty No Mass on De La Soul's "I Be"
"E-A"
"T" - Ice-T
"Z" - Eazy-E 'We Want Eazy'

[Verse Two] [Murs]:
Rap is easy
Career is the hard part
Niggas starting out this year and thing they Mozart
I'm on that positive, get a lot of money quick
Rock-the-ass-gangbanging-backpacking-Crip-shit
Building with the Gods, love from the Bloods
Red, gold, green but I don't smoke bud
Never been a thug, I'm a man before anything
Getting my respect now, but I always been a king
Dodger blue brown on, putting Mid-Town on
Revenge Of The Nerds, D-Boyz getting clowned on
Back to the hood to buy the block, that's the plan
But that's a little later, back to the music man

[Scratch Hook] {X2}:
"S-K"
"I-B" - Shorty No Mass on De La Soul's "I Be"
"E-A"
"T" - Ice-T
"Z" - Eazy-E 'We Want Eazy'

[Verse Three] [Locksmith]:
Yo, highly unlikely to find me begging for people's acceptance so they don't like me
And I ain't looking for labels to over hype me
Despite these slight haters that wanna spite me
And play me out like Phife, I don't have Type B
Diabetes or Sickle Cell my lyrics swell
Piercing through your veins like sugar cane, sniff or smell
This is jail for free thinkers that think free
This is Heaven for silly rappers that mimic me
Remember me like Kato
I.M.G.M.I Ski Beatz and Murs
We run the Earth like NATO
I know you hate it bro
And yeah I sympathize
And I ain't stopping until you motherfuckers recognize

[Scratch Hook] {X2}:
