[Verse One]:
Her name is Yumi
The one they call "Groupie"
Since she's at every single show they're assuming
She gotta be screwing, somebody in the band
But she's into the music, she ain't tripping off a man
The scene was itty bitty, and in this little city
You can't sing along to songs and be pretty
They threw on they skirts, she threw on some pants
They put on they heels, she slipped on some Vans
Her tone was tan, a beautiful blend
Latin/Asian/American with beautiful skin
Honestly she was born to date a lead singer
Never once worried about the trouble he would bring her
She was in love, he was in lust
But we know a starving artist is so hard to trust
He stole her heart, then took it for a spin
Now it seems the world is revolving around him

[Hook] {x2}:
And she's so lost
Forgot which way is up
Down so long it seems like she's stuck
Down for anything that'll change her luck
Once you hit rock bottom man, enough is enough

And she's so lost {echo}

[Verse Two]:
And all she ever needed
Was someone to be believe in
Search so long for something to give it meaning
Only 19 and, for love she was fiending
Gave it all to him
For no good reason
And he was seasoned, so he took advantage
Scumbag, womanizer, fronting like he's manish
A little boy trying to figure it out
Overconfident, a complex littered with doubt
He was someone she never thought of living without
Until she found him with that bitch and his dick in her mouth
Now she wants to castrate him, throw his dick in his mouth
So she threw a few blows, started bitching him out
But he don't understand what she tripping about
Says that he only cheats because she's always flipping out
The road to womanhood, yet this is the route
But for now, a little girl trying to figure it out

[Hook] {x2}:
And she's so lost
Forgot which way is up
Down so long it seems like she's stuck
Down for anything that'll change her luck
Once you hit rock bottom man, enough is enough

And she's so lost {echo}
