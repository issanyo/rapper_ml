[Verse 1]
He's running for his life
The fucked up thing, this happens every other night
They see him comin', they like, "wassup cuz?"
He in his uniform from Target so they sayin' he's a blood
They know he ain't bangin', they do it for entertainment
Let off a couple shots and they all start to chase him
Heart racin', 'round the corner then he trip
That's when he felt the chrome to his head and heard the click

[Pre-hook]
And every day he puts his backpack on
His headphones in and he plays that song
And now he doesn't feel so alone
Walkin' out the door, he pray to God he make it home
And he just want to make it home
A young black man tryna make it on his own
All this crazy that's going on
He's just trying to survive but they saying that he's wrong

[Hook]
So God bless Kanye West
And every other brother of color that's under stress
They wanna make you feel like you are less
Even though you didn't make it, gotta deal with this mess
Hold your head, and always do your best
It's a long race, you gotta pace your steps
And remember that you are blessed
It's because God loves us that he puts us to the test

[Verse 2]
He's running for his life
The fucked up thing is this week it happened twice
This time the eses, bald head and tattoos
Mad 'cause he datin' they cousin and he a black dude
Hopped in they Regal, they chased him down Pico
He tried to hide in the crowd amongst the other people
High off sherm so they don't give a shit
They rolled down the window and emptied the whole clip

[Pre-Hook]
And every day he puts his backpack on
His headphones in and he plays that song
And now he doesn't feel so alone
Walkin' out the door, he pray to God he make it home
And he just want to make it home
A young black man tryna make it on his own
All this crazy that's going on
He's just trying to survive but they saying that he's wrong

[Bridge]
We in the struggle where the strong kill the strong
Bodies dropping in the ghetto all night long
Can't seem to find a way for us all to get along
It's like they the new Marvin Gaye, what's goin' on?

[Hook]
So God bless Kanye West
And every other brother of color that's under stress
They wanna make you feel like you are less
Even though you didn't make it, gotta deal with this mess
Hold your head, and always do your best
It's a long race, you gotta pace your steps
And remember that you are blessed
It's because God loves us that he puts us to the test

[Verse 3]
He's running for his life
The fucked up thing is tonight is the black and white
They rolled up and told him, "freeze, don't run!"
And that might sound easy, but you see he's got a gun
You know he ain't tryna be on no tough shit
But every single night he was tired of gettin' fucked with
He dropped the gun and it let off a shot
So they returned fire as he ran down the block
This is a story with three different plots
In any of the three the hero could've been shot
Who really did the shooting don't matter a whole lot
Either way a young man was gunned down on his block
And now he laying in the hospital
After all these years of dodging so many obstacles
It don't matter if I tell you who's responsible
It sucks that we're living in a world where this is possible
