[Verse One: Murs]
I grew up off of Pico and C. Dale
Little dude having big dreams of a C.L
But since I wasn't trying to see jail
Focused on my music, tried to be the next C.L
Smooth flow still I hustled on the side though
Kept a backpack full of weed wherever I go
It was all about survival
Game change, wear the same color as my rivals
Man my city's so tribal
Everybody bang, biggest gang is the 5-0
And they perpetuate the cycle
Trap us in this cage then they label us the psychos
I'm obsessed with success but still a suspect
Cause I dress how a thug dress
My whole city in unrest
Homicide, drive-by's and beautiful sunsets

Bear Gang
Everyday I.P
H.D
Living life in 1080 P
Sold base sold kicks but never made a beat
Young nigga in Paris screaming "C'est La Vie"
Drop a few bread crumbs on the latest sneaks
Lacosse [?]
Uh, give a fuck what a hater think
Serve a nigga redrum with his plate of beef
Yeah, sandbox how I play the streets
Dwayne Wade when I wave The Heat
Like my nigga Dru Ha with a navy crease
I'm on my way to the money, you on your way to sleep
"You are sleeping"
Goodnight my nigga
From F.C., but the Hollywood life I live it
As far as the flow
Fas' don't know when to stop
And it ain't over till my home at the top
Is you rolling or not?
