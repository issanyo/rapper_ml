[Verse 1: Murs]
Salute the general, mad miss mineral
Bulletproof pro, no flow is identical
Rocking on stage, and I'm holding on my genitals
Grip on the mic like I got eight tentacles
Most of these rappers compose like common criminals
That's why my intellect is so impressive to these imbeciles
I pay dues, I'm positioned at the pinnacle
What you offer is the opposite of original
In circles of real emcees, they never mention you
When it's Rolls Royce that you pay attention to
Me I'm worth millions on a ten speed and tennis shoes
Most influental, talked about in these interviews
I truly inspire individuals
To rise above the bullshit so they can see residuals
Counting years in the game, homie, it's been a few
I stay making music while the business getting attended to

[Hook: Murs]
Visions of a kingdom, focused on freedom
If they don't share my focus, then fuck it, I don't need 'em
Champagne by the liter, no limit on the Visa
Travel around the globe while watching (?)
Youtube seeder playing 'Follow The Leader'
Tough senorita, no scuffs on the Adidas
Dashbox for the heater
I've been prone to pay Peter
We some stone cold killers
Recognize us when you see us

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
Stone cold killer/S-T-A-R
(?) around it, FC with an AR
Boy, if I was you, I would stay far
A hundred in a shoe box, no State Farm
Usually money is the conversation
We ain't even in the same constellation
Not a doctor, and I ain't got no kind of patience
I'm up early, counting their faces
I'm talkind Starbucks, aw shucks
I might spaz out, shop 'till the mall's shut
On behalf of my clientele
I might as well stay draped in YSL
Curtains closed from dodging the paparazzi
Certain holes from sinning, it's not a hobby
Wanted two on the play
He's doing his thang, you do the same
Salute to the game

[Hook]
