[Hook: Rexx Life Raj]
I won't tell nobody, This could stay between us
They say they've seen everything, well they ain't seen us
We gon' fuck around and they will never know-oh
Keep it on the low (Keep it on the low)
Keep it on the low
Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh
We gon' fuck around and they will never know-oh
Keep it on the low
Keep it on the low

[Verse: Murs]
Hey, hey
She said she like my dreads
Dark skin, thick, wearin' bright ass red
Red weave, and red shoe laces
She  must not know I hang around them blue places
My homies bang the C
But still find trouble, wherever it be
But that's not me, I try to keep it lowkey
I ain't never been a G, I just wanna be free but
We affiliated so I never really dated any ladies from the other side of town
Now I know they all hatin', but I'm tired of the waitin
Gotta get it baby girl right now
Montague Piru and a Crip Capulet
Knew that we would start a war but I had no regrets
Madly in love so we had mad sex
But for some strange reason didn't get a last text
Wanna fake her death
A plan so clever
When it all settled down we would run away together
But I never got a text, so when I saw her dead I pulled the trigger on my pistol and I pointed at my head
When she woke up and saw I blew my brains out
She picked up the pistol and she went the same route
Star-crossed lovers shinin' bright in the afterlife
Still holdin' hands when they found us on that tragic night

[Hook: Rexx Life Raj]
I won't tell nobody, This could stay between us
They say they've seen everything, well they ain't seen us
We gon' fuck around and they will never know-oh
Keep it on the low (Keep it on the low-oh)
Keep it on the low
Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh (keep it on the low, keep it on the low)
We gon' fuck around and they will never know-oh
Keep it on the low
Keep it on the low
