[Verse 1: Himself]
Every time I leave the crib you may think I'm pissed off
But I'm just thinking about these tapes and this weed I need to get off
I love rapping
I love it when a fan tells me that I was snapping
This is NT-Dub gang
Fool, ain't shit changed, and it won't
So when I get the fame don't look at me strange
Hanging around the same spots
Seeing the same homeboys
Being harassed by the same cops
When will it stop?

[Verse 2: Murs]
Probably never, but whatever
I'mma have some fun
So won't you do the same and just grab someone
And tell em that you love them while they're here
Because, we're gone
This is like the last song
So play it again, crack a brew and grab your bong
Just like the first time, but now sing along
So come on
Yes you!
In the car with your friends
Netherworlds is the...
I think I said it again

[Verse 3: Anacron]
We're gonna meet Britney Spears
When this album here drops
And I'll take her to the Grammys
Then I'll beat 'em till it pops
Socking, knock some teeth out
I'm down for the gang
I'm old as hell though, so I be trying not to bang
On them thangs
All about making scratch
And having a good time with the homies as I catch
Sun rays and good vibes when I get back to LA
Birthplace of the Netherworlds
Him, Murs and A
Droppin' hits since ninety tre
(all day)

[Outro]
Ha, ha, yeahhh!
Ayo DJ stop that beat for me, stop that beat
Yo, my man said he ain't trying to bang!
He trying to come with that Netherworlds shit
You know what I'm saying?
Yo, that shit I be playing at my joints and motherfuckers shoot the place up
You Know what I'm sayin? Yeahhh
