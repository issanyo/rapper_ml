[Intro]
Next up on Animals Dammit
We explore the sudden emergence of Gorillas on the South West coast of North America
Definitely not native to this region
These creatures are already leaving an indelible mark on the urban landscape
Join us, as we journey deep in the jungle to expose this new phenomenon

[Hook: Beleaf]
Uh
This an animal's planet
I got animals dammit
My gorillas throw gang signs, y'all niggas can't handle it
Why y'all niggas can't handle it?
Why y'all niggas can't handle it?
My gorillas throw gang signs, y'all niggas can't handle it
This an animal's planet
I got animals dammit
My gorillas throw gang signs, y'all niggas can't handle it
Why y'all niggas can't handle it?
Why y'all niggas can't handle it?
My gorillas throw gang signs, y'all niggas can't handle it
Ha!

[Verse 1: Murs]
Deep in the jungles
Off of Nicolette
In front of Dorsey High with a marijuana cigarette
At the marketplace, very African
Sippin' on some liquor that I copped from the Pakistan
Shoelaces, red, gold, green
'Bout to hit up that parade for the Martin Luther King
Niggas at Louisiana Chicken sat trippin'
CK shirts on, Anti-Crippin'
Damn
I'm just try'na move these incense
This situation so intense
Still see the families barbecuein', drill teams in the middle of the street this is how we do it
This was 9-6 and that was the jam still
Back when niggas banged heavy metal like anvil
Droppin' off the cliff on the head of that coyote
Gettin' chased by the blue bird, just like cody
Get it? Forget it
I'm up at autobahn
Walkin' past people sellin' jewelry on they front lawn
Seen this rap nigga I used to have beef with
Walkin' in his tank top like he on some G-Shit
Just got his deal on some Crip wannabe shit
20 years later he was on some MTV shit
Anyways, I'm sidetracked on a tangent
Tryna finish tellin' you this story

[Verse 2: Murs & (Beleaf)]
Saw my homies from my neighborhood comin' up the street
Dressed in all blue from the head to they feet
They didn't see me, but I seen them
I try to dip out that's when I hear the homie Demon he like
"What up Nick, cuz?"
I'm like "Shit, fuck."
These motherfuckers Goddamn
I just don't understand
Gettin' caught up with these niggas wasn't part of the plan
I act like I'm happy to see 'em
I dap 'em up
And in the back of my mind I know they about to act up
"Haaa, what y'all niggas doin' up here?"
(Nothin' cuz, heard some enemies was up here)
(You wanna leave Nick?)
(You got a problem? )
(Guess you only kick it with us when you got a problem)
I just had them tools at my school last week
I told them fools they're trippin', then they came up there mad deep
A friend in need is a friend indeed
So I tried to distract 'em and I offered 'em some weed
It didn't work, they seen them dudes at the chicken spot
All them blood niggas standin' up on the rooftop
Didn't take long before they spotted us
And any other day they would've been done shotted us
Too many people in the street to bear witness
And they all hopped down from the roof with a quickness
I seen one of 'em try to reach in his waist
So Colossus threw a barbecue grill in his face
Sparks flyin' everywhere, people is screamin'
That's when two of 'em tried to hop on Demon
And I seen a fist comin' out of my periphery
And all of the sudden the asphalt got slippery
I got hit
My feet slipped out from under me
Now I'm goin' down, down, down, like a submarine
Knocked out cold in the middle of Crenshaw
A nigga named Grit got credit for the pinfall
I woke up, slightly concussed in handcuffs
Bleedin' from my head, I could barely even stand up
Police askin' me what transpired
When I said I didn't know they was callin' me a liar
A call on they radio said shots fired
So they had to let me go 'cause a priority was hired
They drove off, tires screechin', lights flashin'
Homies pulled up and told me get my ass in
I got to the crib and I got me a ice pack
These niggas wanna smoke right before they go strike back
Now they got jokes, laughin' cause I got knocked out
I'm happy that I'm home, I give a fuck what they talkin' 'bout
On the couch with a concussion, niggas clownin' me but well
It's better than havin' a concussion in the county jail
