[Hook] [Fashawn]:
No justice, it's just us
Heartbreaks and handcuffs
What's going on, yeah what's on, yeah what's going on, yeah what's going on?
The weatherman said it would rain
Still the clear sky remains
King what's going on, yeah what's on, yeah what's going on, yeah what's going on?

[Verse One] [Murs]:
2012, the number
Another summer
Americans keep getting dumber
Billion dollar corporations still going under
Rest of the world still struggling with hunger
So I dream to make a better day
Making music saying things that they would never say
I come from the same hood with no hope
But never use that excuse to slang dope
Never live somebody else's dream
And always hold on to your self esteem
You should never give your vision up
If no one else does, remember I give a fuck
I vote and pay taxes
Still dealing with the police harassment
Through the hard time, we stay laughing
Head above water, from the cradle to the casket

[Hook] [Fashawn]:
No justice, it's just us
Heartbreaks and handcuffs
What's going on, yeah what's on, yeah what's going on, yeah what's going on?
The weatherman said it would rain
Still the clear sky remains
King what's going on, yeah what's on, yeah what's going on, yeah what's going on?

[Murs]:
To all my dreamers on the west coast
All my dreamers on the east coast

[Fashawn]:
We got to find a way
We've got to find a way
Yeah

[Murs]:
To all my dreamers in the mid west
All my dreamers down south

[Fashawn]:
We got to find a way
We've got to find a way
Yeah

[Murs]:
This is for my dreamers all around the world

[Verse Two] [Fashawn]:
Escape the inner
C-I-T-Y if I could
Like Treyvon, probably die in my hood
We not, miseducated, but misunderstood
Tried to show 'em my intentions were good
Damn, what's going on?
People in the inner city is tired
Figured out Lady Liberty lied
We reside where news cameras never arrive
And the people in the government, forever collide
What a mess we've made in the U.S of A
All for a slice of American pie
We've was bred to be ready to die
Ask the president "Why?"
Look him dead in the eye
Tell me how he reply
Dealing with the residue of hope
Damn, I should've registered to vote
Uh huh, east to the left coast
Is trying to stay afloat, we all in the same boat

[Hook] [Fashawn]:
No justice, it's just us
Heartbreaks and handcuffs
Yeah what's going on, yeah what's on, yeah what's going on, yeah what's going on?
The weatherman said it would rain
Still the clear sky remains
King what's going on, yeah what's on, yeah what's going on, yeah what's going on?
