"California soul"

[Verse 1: Murs]
And that's me with a smile
Fist clenched when I stroll
Everyday's top down
Don't know nothin' about the cold
Never been (Snowed in)
Coast stays (Golden)
Bright lights, big city
Bus cost a buck sixty
But watch out for the 60s when they out (Rollin')
Tearin' up every function and I swear it be for nothin'
L.A. niggas goin' out just to get into somethin'
Cowards get tormented
Concrete war scented
California essence to the beat in four minutes
While we fight for no reason, livin' life with no seasons
With them low life heathens
Lips tight, no cheesin'
Cause it's hard on a nigga
Never fall from a trigger so I stay distant from home
I mean I love Cali
But I love it so much I had to leave it alone

[Verse 2: Anacron]
San Fran, L.A., S.D., S.J
Pasad, Fonte, Oak Town and me
Placed in the heart of Killa Cal when I was young
Ain't no debate which state I originate from
Born in NC and now stay in IL
Four fifths of my life, time went quite swell
In C-A-L-I, these days tell my
History cultivated by a golden sun
Holdin' guns pokin' fun at the homeboy
Playin' the dozens of hood rats like toys
Nice boy is quite coy
And knows how to mack
California is the spot where all the hot broads is at
Besides all of that
My state create grade fives
I love to take rides on a peaceful mountainside
Look down and admire the land where fool's bang
And hang late night with heavy R's in their slang
You wouldn't understand though
It's a Cali soul thang
Please believe it

[Verse 3: Himself]
Man look, I'm old school L.A. like Ice-T's perm
Roll through your hood, lookin' for you like Big Worm
Looks like you motherfuckers just ain't learn
I'll mash you too, you just gotta wait your turn
I'm old school L.A. like King Tee's loc's
Old school L.A. like drive-bys and 100 spokes
I'm old school L.A. like 6-4's
Niggas in L.A. don't need Bentley's to get hoes
I'm old school L.A. like crocasacks
Jheri curls and Dodger's caps
Bitches with straps
This is where the sun goes down
Late night, big guns, show down
Shake up the whole town
Tryin' to destroy the only block you hold down
You need to slow down
You don't wanna lose your life over dumb crimes
Avoid the one time
And enjoy your life in the California sunshine
Oh yeah
Believe it
