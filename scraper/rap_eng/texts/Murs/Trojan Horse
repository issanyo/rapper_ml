[Intro]
Someone called Living Legends?
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Here we go...
Yah...
Ya'all know what that sound like

[Verse 1: Murs]
What up tho? West Coast!
Murs!
Crips, Bloods, Es√©s
Living Legends, trece
Stoners and the skaters made it cool to be from LA
Yah, it's no reunions and no comebacks
Everything these new dudes is doin'
Man we done that - fool!
Bangin' on the industry since '96 in the average city
World wide we was grindin', bitch
So insane the most profane
And you ain't got a momma
You don't know my name

[Segue]
Oh, What? Next next Lucky

[Verse 2: Luckyiam.PSC]
Tommy Trojan here
He a soldier. Devotion is approachin' them epic proportions, yup
It's the legends. hey, who's supportin'?
Now let me see them L's and talkin' about what's smokin', but
Puff it out tho
And say whattup tho
Your dudes took a break but they still ain't catching us, yo
Cool story bro, Lucky make the party go
Now check my audio they love me in the barrio, homes

[Segue]
We don't stop
Next up on the mic - Eligh

[Verse 3: Eligh]
This beat is like John Henry, pounding railroad spikes
My name is the famous, the infamous nameless
Game changer with language ranger
Not a stranger to the dark corners of the mind
Fornicate a half a rhyme or the beat of time
Never see the line
Penetrate a fine line between me and you
Mind your P's and Q's
Living Legends, even the groupies speak the truth
Preach to you like no one can
No one man above the Dude, but I am the Crow
Get sh*t on, give it up more than you can too
Admit it, get with it, Eligh's my name
Now give it the credit, we all pay dues
In the Oakland zoo....

[Segue]
Next up to bat .. Scarub

[Verse 4: Scarub]
Time flies, I'm a pilot, all aboard
Systems clear, time traveler, check the mileage
Tour guide and I [? 1:42] a deer
Time is money, spend it wisely
Good investments, more to spare
And time and time it ain't' surprisin'
Legends baby, none compare
But the name on the bill of the cap
Like a baseball team up to bat
Major league, run the scene, heavy hitter, rhyme spitter
But the flow is supreme
Competing with the underground and the mainstream
Yea it's on!
In a minute I'm gonna act
Like a bad habit of a drug addict
New Sound!
[? 1:57] fun game
Yup! Living Legends

[Segue]
Who's up next... Bicasso

[Verse 5: Bicasso]
If you don't do this shit for fun your dumb
Too many people try to be the freshest one
Umm, Swag, I got your rehab, medicate
Medical grade A, got to stay paid, eh!
Yah, with some of this and some of that
I'm with it, to my Legends in the front, where you at?
Go get it! Bic!
B.I. marchin' on the Coliseum
I marked this aisle before the Raiders used to USC
An' screamin' "Free OJ!"

[Segue]
Who's that man in the corner comin' out? The Grouch!

[Verse 6: The Grouch]
For then, now and always, I'll be down
They all say my raps count triple
Grouch, Simple Man, everyday doin' what I gotta
Gotta love what I do, 'cause I wrote it like a fairy tale
It very well grew
Now go tell the others, discover something new
From an old soul bro, so doze, no, you
Open your third see a bird's eye view
Get you higher than the herbs off the words I drew

[Segue]
It's the last one, original Asop

[Verse 7: Asop]
This Asop ain't got no white face
Best call him by his birth name
I was there, in the clear
Watch 'em dance in the first flame
Dare don't care about hearsay
Listen up to what him say
Wise, lies, I ain't lyin'
Invented inventative word play, bitch!
Yup! coming back from a seven year itch
Which is the reason that my style will constantly switch
Game, put that black back in the name, they lame
They sound the same, we invented the underground game

[Segue]
That's why we take the motherfuckers over
It's the man that started this shit, Sunspot

[Verse 8: Sunspot Jonz]
I say my name is Sunspot
Explode all you fucks
Ducks in the range, your head tore off
Best of the best! Legends of it all!
When all my favorite rappers come wack went soft
We do it for the honor, we don't lack no heart
They do it for the comma, just a tax write off
Eh, and now they clone their revenge, it ain't a sheep dance
Record biz off, emcees on now
Defeat? we take 'em all out! Legends! Bitch

[Outro]
Living Legends crew, we back!
Actually, we never left, bitch!
