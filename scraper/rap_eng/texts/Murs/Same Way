[Intro: Murs]
So if they knew better, they would do better
But ain't nobody gonna treat you better
Ay, tell 'em I feel the same way
Yeah, tell 'em I feel the same way
Her, him, your auntie
Look, tell 'em I feel the same way
Yeah, anybody hit you up
Tell 'em I feel the

[Verse 1: Murs]
I got a thing for you baby girl
But I don't seem to fit up in your crazy world
I'm that square peg in a round hole
I know what you're family sayin' on the down low
And all your homegirls highkey hate me though
They still use my login for the HBO
Amazon, Netflix, and some mo' shit
Don't even know why you listen to them broke chicks
And get your sister 'cause she slidin' in my DMs
Sayin' we should meet up at the gym and we should be friends
Yo mama smilin' at me but that don't mean nothin'
'Cause she still invite your ex to every family function

[Chorus: Murs]
I know your friends don't like me
Tell 'em I feel the same way (same way)
I heard your brother wanna fight me
Tell him I feel the same way (I feel the same way)
Your sister say she never date me
Tell her I feel the same way (same way)
Seem like your whole family hate me
Tell 'em I feel the same way

[Verse 2: Murs]
Close your ears to the nonsense
This our channel, we creatin' all the content
And they can leave their comments underneath
But best believe it's problems when I see them in the streets
We must protect our way
Can't nobody say nothin' bad about bae
They can talk crazy but it's just talk
But if I let them phase me it's my fault
I'm secure till you show me why I shouldn't be
I ain't never had a woman be this good to me, oh
But your brother gettin' put to sleep
I can't let him slide, I got too much hood in me

[Chorus: Murs]
I know your friends don't like me
Tell 'em I feel the same way (same way)
I heard your brother wanna fight me
Tell him I feel the same way (I feel the same way)
Your sister say she never date me
Tell her I feel the same way (same way)
Seem like your whole family hate me
Tell 'em I feel the same way

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Funny how people change when you don’t feel the same
Women you used to claim each other, now they in pain
Now they slander your name and your label mates reppin’ Strange
All because you found a new lane, they really hate that you took away that wing
Now we can not keep it cordial
When you treat them with respect, they treat you horrible
When I was given all I gave up it was adorable
Now when I see you, I wouldn’t give the bitch a morsel
Threaten my life on the phone talkin’ that gang spray
How come my homies lookin’ forward to havin’ a bang day?
All this hatin’ when I was young until I became great
Tellin’ you people not to feel me, I feel the same way, fuck y’all

[Chorus: Murs]
I know your friends don't like me
Tell 'em I feel the same way (same way)
I heard your brother wanna fight me
Tell him I feel the same way (I feel the same way)
Your sister say she never date me
Tell her I feel the same way (same way)
Seem like your whole family hate me
Tell 'em I feel the same way
