[Verse 1]
Southern California underground funk assassin
Known to blast the competition, break em up like New Edition
I'm gonna rob you, throb you, rip you with mics
And make you question your commitment like my dicks in your wife
And I'm hitting it right
Now how's that for a visual to make your brain stall
Your old ball and chain now chained to my wall
I'mma reign til I fall, when I do I'll get a stunt double
Like to play it smart so I hump when there's trouble
While you try to go for broke with them punks in your huddle
I play Voldemort and bring the magic to the muggles
Just dove in the struggle, not waiting waist deep
Licking kicks off the snares while you suckas waste beats
Lose your hunger for success once you taste defeat
So I'mma show you how to eat
You gotta let it wet your appetite
Spit it out and rap just tight
Keep a sense of humor and just kick back and laugh at life

[Hook]
It'll drive you crazy if you let it take over
Have you stressed to the point where you can't stay sober
It'll drive you crazy if you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
It'll drive you crazy if you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
It'll drive you crazy if you let it don't forget it
Take control of your life or you just might regret it

[Verse 2]
That's how I got these panic attacks and frantical raps
Thats cold as a chick mixed hispanic with black
But still spit it so hot they'll have to ban it from wax
Or at least press it on that heavy european shit
So you can't want beef when you're a vegan bitch
Props to BLX, I hope y'all see them checks
I'm upping woman from the back like a CRX
And real heads can stop waiting cause we are next
Def J-U-X and Living Legends coming through when I play two sets
Like Shock G and D.U. don't know the half about blowing up
I call you see too
Treat it like an opening act of movie preview
Cause everybody in the house came to watch what we do
Since your rhymes are as fly as a fucking Emu
So even if I only make MTV2
It's better than me stuck in a rut being you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Quit letting your girl run you life and homie be a man
Your lady's not supposed to be your one and only fan
Or your manager, that's a conflict of interest
I expect nothing less from a product of incest
I been fresh since my first song in '92
When I got with 3MG we put it down since high school
So mother fuckers, know, how, I, do
I shove this mic down your throat and start speaking into you
And my mic sounds nice, check one
I can sing in the middle of this verse just for fun
Like, la la la la laaa
I know it's off key but when Oh No's on the beat
He can make something even that vile seem sweet
As revenge on your ex-girlfriend who fucked your best friend
While you were drunk passed out in your den
So while you were downing Hen
She was going down on him

[Hook]
