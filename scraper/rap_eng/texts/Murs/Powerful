[Verse 1: Murs]
(Powerful)
They call me slept on, guess I'm the one they dreaming 'bout
But when they finally woke, it'll be my name that they'll be screaming out
Been walking this path from an early age
Reading books by the Panthers, building up my rage
At age 14, rest soul on ice
Spook Who Sat By The Door, read that joint twice
Ice Cube, Brotha J and Ice T
These are the professors that would set my mind free
Fuck the police to the Easton cop killer
These were my textbooks, sorry it was not thriller
That pop music was filler, no disrespect to Mike
But I was fed up and focused, I was ready to fight
The power
With Flavor Flav and Carl Ridenhour now emerged my energy with Public Enemy for many hours
Towers of Babylon that radiate pollution
Are the same ones we'll be using to stream the revolution

[Chorus: Murs]
Facts is facts and the fact is whack is whack
Nowadays they need to let the rappers rap
Facts is facts and the fact is trap is trap
Whip that work, but just let the rappers rap
Facts is facts, it's a fact that you stackin' racks
Get your money, but just let the rappers rap
Rappers act like rappers but they still singing
Autotune and making music with no meaning

[Verse 2: Murs]
I stand for the flag, and stand for my people
This is not a contradiction, I am not a fan of evil
Most of these rappers is evil as these politicians
Flexing on their own folks who ain't even got a pot to piss in
Still they loving on the bad guy
Try to be the hero, my people tell me to stand by (Stand by)
Cause I don't rap about the coonery
I'm Rogue One, standing like Diego in this lunacy
Ergo, my Earth go Urso, full circle
And we plant seeds amongst the weeds to make the Earth grow
Pollocks sprout as I spout this intelligence
Horrid in my aura, my intent is of intelligence
Radio once meant relevance, now irrelevant
It's all about the playlist, the playing field is levelling
If you got better ideas, then I am Edison
Electrifying and defining true music medicine

[Chorus: Murs]
Facts is facts and the fact is whack is whack
Nowadays they need to let the rappers rap
Facts is facts and the fact is trap is trap
Whip that work, but just let the rappers rap
Facts is facts, it's a fact that you stackin' racks
Get your money, but just let the rappers rap
Rappers act like rappers but they still singing
Autotune and making music with no meaning

[Outro: Propaganda]
We live in this odd paradox right?
This juxtaposition of knowing too much and not enough
I got facts to quote ya, you just don't know when to shut up
When you can't un-understand
Know too much to leave it alone and not enough to trust the process of seeing too much
Art that builds cultures and chants down tyranny's power
And empowers powerless, homie how you gon' change the land with one tenth of your man's fanbase
Facts!
Am I too smart to be that dumb or too dumb to be that smart
Lol, nevermind, I'll just rap
