I did you wrong, I regret each day

[Verse One]
The saying goes, "You never know what you had
Till your well runs dry and you miss it so bad"
Not one for cliches
But on the replay
I did you wrong I regret each day
Can I make it up to you by makin' love to you?
You don't want my mistake to be what breaks us up do you?
Before you answer, just give yourself the chance to
Think about our past and how strong our romance was
Worse than cancer it's killin' me slowly
Never in my life have I been so lonely
And when I think about the pain that you must've felt
I swear to God I wanna kill myself
It won't change what happened, you probably still hate me
Never thought that you would be the one to forsake me
But now you gone, it's just the same old song
You never miss it, never miss it, never miss it till it's gone

[Hook]
My only wish is for you to completely forget me
She said she regrets the day that she met me
The only one to ever truly get me
I swear she took the life outta me when she left me
My only wish is for our love's resurrection
In your absence I appreciate perfection
I would sacrifice myself for your protection
And die for the chance to regain your affection

[Verse Two]
Look, it's kinda complicated when you lovin' a close friend
I feel like I treated her way better than most men
I admit
I cheated a few times
But I thought she'd do her dirt and I'd do mine
I really didn't care who the hell she was fuckin'
I tried to play it cool but she could tell that I was frontin'
Talk to my friends but they can't tell me nothin'
It hurts like hell when you're the cause of you're suffering
Take it like a man, bottle in my hand
Shot after shot until I can barely stand
And you don't understand, that's the only way I sleep
Should've known that these girls I bring home can't compete
I'm just not the man that I used to be
All of a sudden all these girls ain't as cute to me
I would murder all these groupie whores and burn them in effigy
If there was any home you could love what is left of me

[Hook]
