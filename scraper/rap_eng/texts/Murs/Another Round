[Verse 1: Murs]
She called first, then I called back
All the sudden feelings seem to resurface, in fact
I was on Cloud 9, I said "It's about time"
I pulled up just to show you I was serious 'bout mine
You came to the car, and you came in the car
We didn't make it far, 'cause you was making it hard
To keep my hands off you
I wanted to talk too
I hate your ex, but I love the things that he taught you
Better than last time
Wetter than last time
Then went into the house to grab some drinks, it was half-time
Shaking my head, we went straight to the bed
Then started making so much noise, it's like we waking the dead
She said "I never stopped feeling you, thought about killing you
Last time you left, it felt like my heart split in two"
I told her I'd fix her, didn't stop, I just kissed her
Put my head between her legs and showed her how much I missed her

[Hook: Murs]
And here we go for another round
It's like you build me up just to bring me down
When you broke my heart it didn't make a sound
Been through so much, I don't know if I could take it now

[Post-Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It's like I was made to love you (trouble)
Nobody can save me from you
One step closer, and I wanna go there
See you foreign sober, if you don't care
Let's go another round

[Verse 2: Murs]
I had to do it looking at the front door, then I finally had to walk through it
The main source of my joy and pain
They say that love fills the heart, but destroys the brain
Insane, crazy, thinking just maybe you would change your ways, but all you ever did was blame me
Like it's my fault that you had to cheat
Flipped the conversation all 'a sudden, now you mad at me
Three in the morning and you ain't come over yet?
It's like the nice guys always get the most disrespect
Your phone die? You didn't see my text?
See, I already know what you 'bout to say next
"Sex was so amazing that I didn't want to leave a fam"
It takes more than sex if you really wanna keep a man
Quicksand, when I struggle it gets deeper
And before I ever leave her, I would rather meet the reaper, damn

[Hook: Murs]
And here we go for another round
It's like you build me up just to bring me down
When you broke my heart it didn't make a sound
Been through so much, I don't know if I could take it now

[Post-Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It's like I was made to love you (trouble)
Nobody can save me from you
One step closer, and I wanna go there
See you foreign sober, if you don't care
Let's go another round
