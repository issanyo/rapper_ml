[Intro]
Murs: So yo, there's songs about Asian girls and dark skinned white girls, silly girls
Man 1: What about the sisters, bro?
Murs: This one right here is for my Nubian Queens
Man 2: Excuse me, what's a Nubian?
Murs: What?! Bro quite being a racist come on

[Verse 1]
This is out to all the black girls
Tall, skinny and fat girls
"I know I'm all that" girls
"Better watch how you act" girls
This goes out to all the black girls
"Hit me, I hit back'' girls
"I deserve better, that's a fact" girls
The "leave and never look back" girls
The "look good from the back" girls
"Dropping low make it clap" girls
"In the mirror Snapchat" girls
"Uh-uh none of that" girls
"Keep playing and you might get slapped" girls
The black girls who like black girls
"Ass walk passed and you both look back" girls
"Used to run track" girls
"Books in the backpack" girls
"I ain't never seen a trap'' girls
"My daddy taught me better than that'' girls
Black girls make white girls wanna twerk
Black girl was the first girl on Earth
Black girls gotta know they worth
And every black girl gotta know this verse

[Hook]
Black girls like music when they do it
So they gotta put they back into it
Black girls like music, got some pain in 'em
Same pain that you feel when you ain't with 'em
Black girls like music, got some rhythm in 'em
Gotta have a good rap just to get with 'em
Blacks girls like music they can groove to
Have a drink, smoke a blunt and cruise to

[Bridge]
And all the black girls say ''yes!'' (x4)
Get it girl (x2)
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it girl
Get it girl (x2)
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it girl

[Verse 2]
Black girls be like magic in some ways
When they smiling ain't nothing but sun rays
Black girls got weaves and afros
Independent they don't need your cash flow
Black girls in L.A. go to North Ridge
Getting paid, she ain't taking care of your kids
Some black girls like to do yoga now
I go to class just to watch 'em bend over, wow!
Some black girls be half white
But still say they black, is that alright?
Black girls at the Fatburger drive-through
Free fries but they hate to be lied to
If you got a black girl beside you
Please believe you got a "ride or die" boo
Black's not just the color of her skin
But a deeper shade of soul within

[Hook]
Black girls like music when they do it
So they gotta put they back into it
Black girls like music, got some pain in 'em
Same pain that you feel when you ain't with 'em
Black girls like music, got some rhythm in 'em
Gotta have a good rap just to get with 'em
Blacks girls like music they can groove to
Have a drink, smoke a blunt and cruise to

[Bridge]
And all the black girls say ''yes!'' (x4)
Get it girl (x2)
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it girl
Get it girl (x2)
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it girl
