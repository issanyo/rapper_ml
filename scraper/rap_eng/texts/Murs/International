Beijing to Seoul, Beirut to London
A red flag's hoisting to the skies
As if to say our time is coming
As if a sun's begun to rise
And can you hear the children singing
About a future fair for all
They'll live to see that red flag waving
They'll live to see this order fall
The old world dies in sheets of flame
Its banks destroyed, its streets on fire
And even stone is not written in stone
The world is made of our desire
With open eyes, and a sense of mission
We'll realise our dream some day
A universal recognition
Of justice, healthcare, equal pay
And can you hear the world insisting
A single song in every throat
On a new international system
For which they'll never let us vote
The old world dies in sheets of flame
Its banks destroyed, its streets on fire
And even stone is not written in stone
The world is made of our desire!
