[Verse 1: Murs]
Tonight is epic, it’s one of them ones
So much danger and so much fun
And if the cops come they just might pop some
I’m talking bottles not bullets from no shotgun
I’m riding shotgun I ain’t even tryna drive
A riot maker guaranteed to keep the party live
I’m with my whole tribe and you can feel the vibe
We going in, I’m just hoping that we all survive
It’s do or die, tomorrow’s just a dream
The night belongs to us, the whole fucking team
Know what the fuck I mean top of the world shit
On some 2010 screaming "Free Earl bitch!"
Girls in my clique, a fuckin’ freak show
They turnin’ up like it’s Mustard on the beat ho
They like to drink, they like to smoke, they like to fuck too
And if you trying to judge us then it’s fuck you

[Hook x2]
And I don't even know you motherfuckers' name
And I don't really care if you understand
Excuse me in advance if you can't, cause tonight we going in
Like tomorrow's gon' be New Years Day

[Verse 2: Bernz]
In the lab like seven days a week, trying to freak that beat
But not tonight, we going out man, we on work release
We squaded up, we going to start a scene
We young and dumb and we running wild on these city streets
Spirits flowing while smoke is blowing, I know we glowing
Golden child I know we loud, we in our moment
Play my shit or just let me be, man I'm fucking zoning
Matter fact I might buy the bar cause I'm feeling lonely
Everybody need a getaway, from the everyday things man
Let's treat tonight like a holiday and toast to our achievements
One shot for the fact we made it, two shots make sure we faded
One more for the pretty young lady, man turn it up cause we celebrating
Next level shit man I'm Mario, think I saved the princess
I ain't even rich but I feel success is stranger than fiction
So I'm kicking up my sneaks and starting new traditions
We ain't even hit our peak but I feel vertigo kick in

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
Came to, room full of the same crew
A place where we pay dues and try to make them raise roof
I need a break, I need some life, scenery can change to
Just give me the gun or the checkered flag and bet I pass into plain view
Moving now, wind whispers in my ear for whiskey
Shots zing and miss me but she's still feeling frisky
You lady luck, I came to fuck and think that you should bare my child
We'll do some drugs, make some love, laugh a bit and share a smile
(Off riding the blackbird wings)
I'm seeing the ground below and sealing the (adverse rings)
There's nothing that can keep me riding higher than I feel right now
My mind just keeps on rising when the southern sun lights down
So we can

[Outro]
[Bernz]
Turn up the potency, make it go all night
[Murs]
Don’t nothin’ worry me, it’s gonna be alright
[Wrekonize]
I carry currency, to pay the car price
[All]
But for now let it go and let's get high with these low lifes

[Hook]
