[Verse 1: Murs]
They didn't care if I lived or died
I didn't smoke weed so I could feel the high
I smoked so I didn't have to feel the low
A weird nigga that started writing the illest flows
Then I started fucking killer hoes
LYG, triple five, started selling clothes
Thought I was on for a minute though
Untill I peeped how them other niggas didn't grow
Strung out fucking dirty bitches, pitiful
Never me, I had to come up with a different flow
Exposing expanding ways of getting dough
Had to do it like it had never been did before
(?) originality is critical
A long way since my days as a criminal
And now your boy owns the biggest show
Showing these young niggas how to make a business grow

[Hook: Fashawn]
Do it like it's never been done
No second guessing, I'm the one
Second to none
Far from over, I swear it's just begun
Begun, begun

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
I could have kept sellin purp, had the worst career
No more snatching purses, I persevere
Yeah, from the bottom to the top
Sipping Vodka on the block to eating lobster on the yacht
Like it or not, but I came from the gutter
Betty Crocker on the block, boy is butter
Product of that child protective
Expecting to live wild and reckless
From the foulest section
Complex crack (?) effective
Sound of the 40 cal. is definite
Yeah, avoiding the trap to the track
Graduated without the gown or the cap
Had to go OT, keep the town on the map
Shut it down from the front, the crowd to the back
I do it like you never could do it in the school of
Hard knock, you forever a student, nigga

[Hook]
