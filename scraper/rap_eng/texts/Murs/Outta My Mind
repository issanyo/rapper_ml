[Hook]
I know I'm out of my mind- I've lost my mind
Or just ahead of my time- the brain is insane
I know I'm out of my mind-I might lose control
Or just ahead of my time- the mind tricks the body, the body thinks the mind's great

[Verse 1: Evidence]
Rocking it first was hell without Rakaa
I pop off in spots, they're screaming - " do clockwork!"
I'm Dilated but fuck off -I'm not doing it;
Before weatherman dropped, they thought I might have ruined it
Elusive... I just deny roomers...
Smile and give punchlines with dry humor, (hahaha)
See what the future brings...
In '03 I got on MTV. (remember that?)
Time is bug- that's the message I'm sending them,(you know?)
Signed with Slug and survived beef with Eminem
I mention different events in my sentences-
It's dangerous to reminisce or remember it
And still it's Evidence, check one-two, one-two
Less punches and spit what I've been through
I stay here got booed but kept rapping
The same year got sued Kurt Matlin (...fucking asshole)

[Verse 2: Murs]
Look, I know where I come from and know who I've started with
But trying to split the check eight-ways that's the hardest shit
And ain't starving- shit! I had to get my own
So ain't trying to hear that bullshit you own
Like you love my brothers, my crew more than I do
Anytime I make change I gotta run it by you
(furious inhalant), I wish I would give a fuck
I was broke in the hood on porch in some chucks
The first one saying Mid-city on these records
And made the world respect it
Cloverdale 13 hundred block moving
Sunshine, rhyme, bitches- that's how we do it
And what'you doing, man, you shoveling snow?
Through the coke up your nose, you in love with the blow? (oops!)
Think I'm dissing my own crew?
But I love the Living Legends I was talking about you
