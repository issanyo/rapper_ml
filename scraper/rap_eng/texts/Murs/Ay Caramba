[Intro]
So this, this is a true story
Not, Not a true story
And all, all whose fault
[?]
My DJ, DJ Meeks ( Fuckin' DJ Meeks )
Jose Juaqim, my tour manager
It's their fuckin' fault too
(Jim the Cleaner)
Motherfuckers ( Straight up )

[Verse 1]
5'9" in a skintight dress
Standin' by the bar lookin' unimpressed
Walked up, asked her how she liked the set
Looked me up and down and she just said "Meh"
Shock, shock, shock, shock
Then I looked at her, said "You're not that hot"
Of course that's what got her
We fucked all night and watched Harry Potter (Whoo!)
Ironically, the pussy was magic
Had a girl at home but I had to have it
I flew her out to all of the markets
June, July, and all of August
'Bout to cut her off right before I got caught up
Then late one night at home she called up
Said that she was 'bout to have my kid
Talkin' 'bout her period late, guess what I did?

[Bridge]
The phone on mute
Ay Caramba
Tried to regroup
Ay Caramba
Something, something, something
Ay Caramba
I don't give a fuck, man
Ay Caramba
Ay Caramba
What does this even mean?
Ay Caramba
(Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)
Ay Caramba
Ay Caramba

[Hook]
This shit's so crazy
This bitch 'bout to have my baby
Hopin' she don't tell me lady
'Cause she already think I'm shady
Knew she was trouble when I got her number
Fucked her raw dog for the whole damn summer
Can I keep both? That's what I wonder
Oh my God, nigga, Ay Caramba

[Verse 2]
Chamber of secrets
When she told me she was 'bout to name it and keep it
It's our baby but it's her life
So if she wanna keep it, then it's alright
Now I'm knowin' there's no way to prevent
My girlfriend throwin' me out on the cement
It ain't the first time that she caught me creepin'
But this time I done jumped off the deep end
Ok, shit, maybe this might fly
Hopin' they'll try to be sisterwives
Like my man Bill Paxton and Big Love
Do a reality show and get big pub
When ma find out, she gon' beat my ass
'Cause word get around in the street so fast
I should've pulled out and put my dick in her mouth
Now I got nine months to try and figure it out

[Bridge]
Ay Caramba
Man..
Ay Caramba
Oh, shit..
Ay Caramba
Where the fuck I'm 'bout to live?
Ay Caramba
Oh God..
Ay Caramba
She about to have a kid
Ay Caramba
Should've just..
Jose man!
(Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)
Ay Caramba
Ay Caramba

[Hook]
This shit's so crazy
This bitch 'bout to have my baby
Hopin' she don't tell me lady
'Cause she already think I'm shady
Knew she was trouble when I got her number
Fucked her raw dog for the whole damn summer
Can I keep both? That's what I wonder
Oh my God, nigga, Ay Caramba

[Outro]
(This the song you play when you know you fucked up)
(This the song you play when you know that your luck suck)
(This the song you play when you know you fucked up)
(This the song you play when you know that your luck suck)
(This the song you play when you know you fucked up)
(This the song you play when you know that your luck suck)
Ay Caramba
