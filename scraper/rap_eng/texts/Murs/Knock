Verse 1 (Hopie):
I’m on another level cool
Devil duelin’ on my trouble
But the bass keep em heavy
I’m forever rockin’ steady, I
Better drop em baby since The Dame, Hopie’s name
Settin’ every tongue a-waggin’
That’s what I’d imagine
That’s what I expected when I first hit the deck
When the verse I first let leak seeped into your eardrums
How can I express what I sincerely understood as truth?
Ma-f*ckers never fear the lady till I hit the booth
Seal destinies, in truth I knew I had a calling
That’s why no one tested me or saw this as appalling
Style in the inevitable is never viable
Ms [?], I’m coming to take attention spans
It never a matter of fact can do, ooh
Did I hit em a little too hard?
Collectin’ my [?] like ah god
I’m blastin’ my lyrics like sawed-offs
Made for y’all too different to stomach, five foot, one hundred
F*ck it, 6fingers, Hopie Spitter coming, you love it

Refrain:
(catch me in the trunk)
(catch, catch me in the trunk)
(catch, catch me in the trunk)
(where the speakers knock)

(catch me in the trunk)
(catch, catch me in the trunk)
(catch, catch me in the trunk)
(where the speakers knock)

Verse 2 (MURS):
Ooh, you hear that sh*t?
I hear it too
Yo, who they slappin’? Is it me or you?
That Diamond Dame, or The Legends crew
Either way it go, fool I thought you knew
The remix, in the trunk with Hopie
No disrespect to my Navajo homies
Shoutout to all my [?] livin’ on the res
I’m in the Bay, Blood, wearin’ no red
I used to go Fed, now they go HAM
Baggy jeans and skinny jeans, switchin’ up the program
No room in my pockets, keep my knot in my sock
I used to sell tapes on hate like f*ck the cops
In the parking lots, let the speakers knock
[?] off of Crenshaw, yeah that was the spot
They was bustin’ shots, but the chicks was hot
Four channel amp blowin’ 900 watts yeah

Refrain:
(catch me in the trunk)
(catch, catch me in the trunk)
(catch, catch me in the trunk)
(where the speakers knock)

(catch me in the trunk)
(catch, catch me in the trunk)
(catch, catch me in the trunk)
(where the speakers knock)

Verse 3 (Hopie):
So post ‘cause I’m supposed to be the illest
Chillin’ at my post atop the tippy of the summit
Bump it, slumpin’, I’m Hopie, have you heard?
Too busy for the suckers so I duck and flip the bird
Word, swerve, out the way, never scared, past the gates
Master way I came ‘cause none have last a game
Or virtuose, too verbose, toast, I’m comin’ in
Sizin’ up the victims for the kill, I hope you listenin’
Here’s a play-by-play so take some notes, I’m feelin’ dissident
Sayin’ that I shine is under mine and I’m straight glistenin’
Missin’ in the game a chick who ain’ts for what the sex of you
Let’s review the weaponry, 6fingers is a menace and
Hopie raps are venomous and that’s a checklist
And the rest is just what happens when you add the best ingredients
Really it’s a miracle if we ever could really stop
Nod your head in weak compliance
I am Hopie and I (knock)

(knock)
