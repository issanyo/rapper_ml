[Intro] [MURS Talking]
Yeah, on the serious tip
Christina Ricci why don't you come home girl? I'm tired of the games
I'm ready to make the necessary changes
Whatever it's gonna take to keep you home

[Verse One]
I remember tenth grade when I first started to jones
The first Addam's Family, before you were well known
I was down from the start, we were around the same age
Addam's Family Values was the very next stage
Gold Diggers now and then
Before the magazines
Before the late 90's when you started "Wowin'" men
After Casper I was hooked
With The Ice Storm and Pecker it was my heart that you took
The Opposite Of Sex put me over the top
Buffalo '66, girl you really need to stop
And sadly enough I can't count the blockbusters that followed
So F whoever did you makeup on the set of Sleepy Hollow
Alright I'm not a stalker, I just know what's right for me
And I know I might just be what you're young life is missin'
One night spent with me, out huggin' and kissin'
Talkin' til the sunrise, F them Hollywood guys
Cause they all fake and phony
What you need is a friend/lover/homie
Come to a Legends show and afterward get to know me
But if not, I see you on the street, we meet each other
I'ma introduce myself and ask you, "Do you date brothers?"
If you say you don't, I won't hang my head in shame
I mean at least I tried and if not then I'm to blame
But please stop the games
And come back home put an end to our pain

[Hook] [x6]
Come back home
Christina

[Verse Two]
Have you ever like someone who didn't like you
Or worse, they never knew you existed?
Every time you saw 'em, your stomach did flips
Your insides twisted
Building courage double fisted
Waitin' for that big chance to ask 'em on a date but you missed it
F! Procrastinating cause you're scared of rejection
But if you never take that chance you'll never gain their affection
Collectin' all them letters but you're too scared to send 'em
Hella nervous when they're around
Cause you're scared that you'll offend them
Look, just be yourself
If people don't like you after being yourself...
FUCK EM
Fuck 'em up against the wall with handcuffs on
And crazy glue on their lips
Look, don't trip about what other people think about you
If it was really meant to be then your dream will come true
If not then...
FUCK EM
We both now it's their loss
They missed out on good head and their salad gettin' tossed
What? Wait wait wait
I don't know about the last part, but you know what I mean
There's other fish in the sea
Even if they're on the far side of your stream, ahh
Fuck you love sick motherfuckers, I'm gettin' back to Christina
