Now heres this story about this fool I knew from back in the day His name was Mike, he used to kick raps around the way I used to see this nigga everyday up at the school I mean dude was cool type of fool who always said what he meant You could peep him at lunch Freestylin by the bench Now he lived in the hood some called the Danger Zone so he was no stranger to own ways of gettin a legal scratch But for some Strage reason he wasn't living like that We used to kick back smoke a sack Every now and then but usually he was in the house with his pen Writing raps that all the homies said was fat To match that he got he gots his beats From this nigga named Toan One day Mike said to Toan "Lets hook up a demo man That shit could be on" Or thats what they thought shit didn't pop Right away they got caught slippin And Mike really started trippin After a couple months he droped out of school Now we all day kickin it getting high Smokin blunts even quit his part time J.O.B Tooked the money that he saved Put that shit up on the P And now he's flippin zits Man you know the whole skit On how his ass gon quit After he's stacked enough chips But out the blue he got this call >From this A&R talking bout it's time to sign The first thing that runned threw Mikes mind Is that I won't have to grind So when he got the contract He didn't give it back ignored the print That was fine Flashed 50g's in his face And said "All you have to do Is sign on the line to get it" But Toan wasn't with it Thats when the group split But Mike didn't trip he knew he could get beats From the kids he was on the label with So he took the money did some normal rapper's shit bought his ass a new ride Tried to buy his moms a home But when she said I ain't gonna move up out the hood He paid off all her loans and hit the studio Every single day of the week And made the beat hella tight songs And after a couple a months The album was finished so he gave the masterd To the label so they could handle the bissness

[verse 2]Now when the single dropped It really start to pop His shit hit the charts at the top You could see his video all day on The Box And when he hit the spot All the bitches would jock Same ones back in high school that didn't wanna speak Now they step into Mike tellin him he's a freak But he didn't get the big head And start to tweak he stayed down to earth And kicked it with his homies Every single day on the Turf So when the album released He thought his check might increase But he didn't see the loot Every time he called the label They gave him the same song and dance About his advance having to be recouped And on the day of his second video shoot They told he had been let go It seemed the president thought Rap artist wernt bringing in enough dough You know not enough capital So they dropped the whole Department of Black Music Now most of them artist didn't go on to do shit When back to 9 to 5's punchin clocks Acceptin weekly checks But Mike had a plan after a while He knew he was getting fuck By these record Exec's Now it was time to put the plan in effect Next day at the building he goes in Disguised as the dude from Fed X Takes the elevator all the way To the top floor no sooner then he steps Out the door the secutary askin "Who the package is for" He said "Im here to see uh Mr.Goldstien" She said "Right now he can't be seen" So he tryed t walk past her and ignore it Then she grabed his shirt like "Nah I could sign for it" So he gave her the clip board Then acted like he was pullin a pen Out of his uniform But a rag full of chloriform Then placed over her face The bitch was knocked out slid her fat ass Under the desk just incase no time to waste He went into the Big Man's office As soon as Goldstien seen Mike face He knew something was going on So he reached for the phone Just as Mike expected So he healed up the end of the cord To show him that that shit was dissconected He connected with a knife to his wind pipe Now he couldn't scream for his life He said none of this had to happend If you would've treated your artists right Trying to pimp my peoples art Never giving us a equal part But I was peepin your plan from the start It was never to see us be young black and rich Yal wanted to be the only muthafucker's Stacking chips that fool looked like he was honna have himself a heart attack and shit But Mike stepped back and stabbed him in the heart with the pen he signed his contract with, ain't that a bitch
