[Verse 1]
This here's a jam for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell em
Get shot down cause ya over-zealous
Play hard to get females get jealous
Okay smarty, go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standing on the wall like it was Poindexter
Next day's function, high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone-cold munchin'
Music comes on people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walking, guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove
So come on fat ass and just bust a move

Just bust a move

[Verse 2]
You're on a mission and your wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fly girls just ugly faces
From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself, with a celibate rope
New movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the nine you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin' in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says "Hello
Come sit next to me you fly fellow"
You run over there without a second to lose
You do want it too? Hey, bust a move

[Hook]
You want it, you got it
You want it, baby you got it (Just bust a move)
You want it, you got it
You want it, baby you got it
Yeah

[Verse 3]
In the city, ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, "No way"
Girls are fakin', goodness sakin'
They want a man who brings home the bacon
You got no money, you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are
Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Lookin' for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on the beach perpetrating a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man
So on the beach you're strollin', real high rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove
You better go to the bitch and bust a move

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Break it down for me fellas

[Verse 4]
Your best friend Harry, has a brother Larry
In five minutes from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can
Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man
You say, "neat-o", check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
First you start thinkin' then you start blinking
A bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
Now your dick is feelin' hard cause the girl is stacked
Reception's jumpin' faces pumpin'
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wanna dance to a different groove
Now you know what the FUCK to do

[Hook]
