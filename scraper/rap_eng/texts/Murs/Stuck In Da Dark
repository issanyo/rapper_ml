[Chorus]
I try hard to do the right shit
But I'm stuck in da dark with no light switch
Now I hold my suspended license
And I'm constantly goin through crisis
So maybe I could remain silent
But I ain't got no reason to hide it
And the only way I know to fight this
Is to stay on the road of the righteous

[Verse 1]
Time's goin by, I'm gettin older but
I'm feeling like I'm still 19 and broke as fuck
In my early twenties, still ain't worth a penny
Head full of weed smoke, surp, and henny
I spend my time gettin faded can't stop it
If I clean my act up there's no way you can stop me but
I still gotta feed the demons that inside my mind
Stuck in da dark feeling like my eyes are blind
I try to cut the corners and it never worked
So I take it as a lesson but...

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I almost 30 years old...yet
I wake up every mornin in the cold...sweat
It use to be visions of my own...death
But now I'm seein secrets that my soul's...kept
But uh, dream deferred what scene do I prefer
When I'm sleepin next to you, I'm dreamin bout her
And now I sleep with her, it's you that I dream about
I can't decide which one of you I wanna be without
I'm a pieces I'm indecisive
Stuck in da dark trying to find this light switch
So self righteous myself I fight with
So I seem stuck in this cycle like this
If I could only see what lies ahead
Then I might find sleep when I'm lying in my bed...

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let's drown ourselves in empathy
Cuz that's the way it has to be
I don't care what you've bled for me
I'd rather have my Hennessey
So maybe I could remain silent...
