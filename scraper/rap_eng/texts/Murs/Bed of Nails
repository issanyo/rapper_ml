[Intro: Bernz]
And it goes (Heyyyyyy, ohhhhhhh)
Yeah! (Ohhhhhhh, heyyyyyy) (x3)
Yeah! (Ohhhhhhh)

[Verse 1: Bernz]
Hydro, pyro
Always early for my late arrivals
Rely on me to be unreliable
Can ride with me if you killing your idols
See, I'm blooming late
While all my homies got 401k's
And they been tryin' to get that cake
While I been tryin' to get my plates
I'm 'bout to go raise the stakes whether they ready or not
Guess I'm last to know cause I travel a lot
Cause I'm over the block
Looking in like an astronaut
And I'm still trying to get it, monkey on my back, sweatin'
Got a studio above what they bettin'
And to me the whole thing is poetic
Cause I could lose everything in a second, I'm in heaven

[Hook: Bernz]
(Heyyyyyy)
Yeah! (Ohhhhhhh, heyyyyyy)
And it feel like a bed of nails (Heyyyyyy)
Yeah! (Ohhhhhhh, heyyyyyy)
This whole thing is a bed of nails (Heyyyyyy)
Yeah! (Ohhhhhhh, heyyyyyy)
And it feel like a bed of nails (Heyyyyyy)
Yeah! (Ohhhhhhh, heyyyyyy)
Waking up on a bed of nails

[Verse 2: Murs]
Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure on a nigga
The whole world trying to stress a young nigga
Got my grey hairs coming in, look
I don't care, came up with some crooks
Meadow-brooke, Cloverdale, yeah midtown!
But the silent nigga ready for the get-down
The sun don't shine where we come from
Matter of fact, the sun is what we run from
Whole life like I had to fight
Future always been black as night
It's too light, I don't know how to feel
Just to be happy, gotta pop a pill
Doc had me on prescription shit
I popped one and I flipped some shit
Pimp C told me not to do drugs
Take the pain straight up like a true thug
Type of shit that'll make you feel alive, don't it?
Survive on it, thrive on it, why don't it?
Hurt me the same way that it hurt you
I just keep it all in like a curfew
Till I spit straight heat like I'm Kershaw
Got a bitch putting pins in a Murs doll
I heard that these dick sucking critics that'll hurt ya'll
They built you up, but they waiting on your worst fall

[Hook: Bernz]
(Heyyyyyy)
Yeah! (Ohhhhhhh, heyyyyyy)
And it feel like a bed of nails (Heyyyyyy)
Yeah! (Ohhhhhhh, heyyyyyy)
This whole thing is a bed of nails (Heyyyyyy)
Yeah! (Ohhhhhhh, heyyyyyy)
And it feel like a bed of nails (Heyyyyyy)
Yeah! (Ohhhhhhh, heyyyyyy)
Waking up on a bed of nails
