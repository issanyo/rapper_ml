I'll be, I'll be, I'll be dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin', dancin' on your grave
I'll be
Get Busy, Get Busy
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin', dancin', dancin' on your grave

[Hook]:
These streets are watchin'
Got my eye on you
And what you do
These streets are watchin'
Got my eye on you
And what you do

[Verse One] [Apathy]:
I'm like Sam from Cheers
Chillin' at your funeral
(Dancin' on your grave)
Get it? So beautiful
Kiss my ass motherfucker I'm a heathen
I'm the reason why you're seizurin' and speakin' like a demon
In the coldest darkest region of the planet I be sleepin'
Like a beast in hibernation, I'm just waitin' for a reason
To awaken in the season where it's freezin' I be feastin'
On the flesh of lesser beings, force feeding meat to vegan

[Xzibit]:
Underestimation been one of my best barometers
Animation, you amateurs, drinkin' straight out the bottle
I don't haggle or hassle, you fuckin' assholes asked for it
Merciless, miraculous, immaculate, fast forward
Get it how you think you got it
Did it while you thought about it
Tucked it when you shoulda shot it
That ain't how you speak about it
You actin' like you catchin' bodies with that chalk around 'em
My satisfaction comes from not givin' a fuck about 'em

[Hook]:
These streets are watchin'
Got my eye on you
And what you do
These streets are watchin'
Got my eye on you
And what you do

[Verse Two] [Paul Wall]:
Aye, I'm strapped up like a parachute
They watchin' yo ass, hurry up and give me the loot
For the underdog, waitin' for the levee breech
Chop 'em like an onion, in a bathtub full of bleach
I'll do the south side and body rock your tombstone
Drown your dog in a pool and make a bong with his bones
You little clones are sweeter than a cinnamon scone
You should have never fucked with the kid from Acre's Home

[Ryu]:
On your grave I'm gonna Fred Astaire
Dancin' on your face, yeah
I'mma fuck your kids up
I should run a daycare
Teach 'em how to slang H
How to beat a rape case
The champagne's less filling then the fame but it tastes great
That's why I spill it on these bitches when I hit the stage
No disrespect it's just how my gang celebrates
Dues paid, Paid Dues, Ace Of Spade, Grey Goose
AK's and cocaine, peace dudes, hang loose

[Hook]:
These streets are watchin'
Got my eye on you
And what you do

Get Busy, Get Busy
I'll be dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin', dancin' on your grave
I'll be
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin', dancin', dancin'

[Verse Three] [Murs]:
I'll be dancin' on your grave
Moonwalkin' on your mausoleum
Got the crypt keeper, Crip walkin', man you gotta see him
I'm outta here, man your boy's so major
These haters have heat, but I'm fuckin' with these lasers
Act out a favor now your face is a crater
Real hood nigga dressin' like a pro skater
I'm O.G., I got money to burn
I'm yellin' G.B.C. and hit my dougie on your urn

[Scoop DeVille]:
Scoop De, V.I. double L. E
To the rap game I'm like Arthur Fonzarelli
Blacked out lights through the club like Belly
Real recognize real, you ain't gotta tell me
You smell me?
Huffle puff a chronic sack
What the fuck is wrong with that?
Be afraid, take it to your grave bitch, promise that
Dancin' on that shit
I be campin' on your trip
Keep a phantom on my neck
And a mansion on my wrist

[Hook]:
These streets are watchin'
Got my eye on you
And what you do
These streets are watchin'
Got my eye on you
And what you do

I'll be dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin', dancin' on your grave
I'll be dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin', dancin', dancin' on your grave
