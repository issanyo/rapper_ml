[Verse 1: Murs]
I wanted her to grow up to be my soccer mom
The white girl that I shoulda' took to prom
Her blonde hair was just like sun-rays
She took me far from the block with the gun play
On Sundays she would make me vegan food
And lots of other shit I'd probably never be into
When we traveled I would be the only black person
Except the gay best friend, he was half Persian

[Hook: Murs:]
And she truly was the apple of my eye
Never wanted her to ever leave my sight
Miss America, American as apple pie
My first white girl, her first black guy
Pure love sent from the most high
Racist bullshit came from both sides
My homies used to say she wasn't that fly
My first white girl her first black guy

[Verse 2: Murs]
We used to go to fancy dinners with the folks
It would feel like a episode of Different Strokes
She smelled like a dog when her hair was wet
She said my hair felt like a chia pet
She couldn't take much direct sunlight
Sunburn, no sex, not a fun night
Newsflash white girls have ass too
And for some of you sisters that's bad news

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Murs]
I would yell and she'd never say a word back
She used the word cock, I never heard that
We would get drunk off a ton of liquor
I'd say you white bitch and she'd cum quicker
She told me, don't believe the white lies
My dick was no bigger than a white guys
She looked like Topanga from Boy Meets World
Her first black guy, my first white girl

[Hook]
