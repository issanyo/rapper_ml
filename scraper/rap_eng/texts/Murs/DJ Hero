[Verse 1: Murs & Lou Gramm of Foreigner]
Standing in the rain, freezing cold and soaking wet
Came to hear his favorite DJ play a set
Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show
And all he wanted was to be front row
Heard the roar of the crowd, and he closed his eyes
Dreaming what it'd be like to be inside
Put his ear to the wall, and the crowd went crazy
Then the beat dropped, the beat was amazing
He heard one guitar, just blew him away
And he never heard a record be scratched that way
He got his cash, and the very next day
Bought a beat up turntable in a secondhand store
He couldn't scratch, couldn't mix, couldn't do none of them tricks
But what he did know for sure was this
That one turntable, felt good in his hands
He put his headphones on and came up with a plan
Keep cutting and scratching and he'd be the man
With the treble up high and the bass way down low
Stars in his eyes, dreamed about the big shows
Started at the bottom, only one way to go

[Chorus: Murs & Lou Gramm of Foreigner]
So he started rocking
Ain't never gonna stop
Got to keep on rocking
Someday he's gonna make it to the top
And be a DJ hero (got stars in his eyes)
He's a DJ hero
Started at the bottom, only one way to go
DJ hero (stars in his eyes)
DJ hero (stars in his eyes), he'll come alive tonight

[Verse 2: Murs & Lou Gramm of Foreigner]
In a town without a name, on the road doing sold out shows
Now he's the man and the whole world knows
Spotted a kid in the crowd with stars in his eyes
He thought to himself "I'ma blow his mind
With a cut and a scratch"
He kept the crowd moving and the dance floor packed
He never looked back, now he's living the dream
Had one turntable, made the whole world scream

[Scratch section: Lou Gramm of Foreigner]
Rocking, rocking, rocking
Rocking

[Chorus: Murs & Lou Gramm of Foreigner]
Now he needs to keep on rocking
He just can't stop
Got to keep on rocking
Someday he's gonna make it to the top
And be a DJ hero (got stars in his eyes)
He's a DJ hero
Had one turntable, made the whole world scream
DJ hero (stars in his eyes)
DJ hero (stars in his eyes), come alive tonight

[Scratch/Guitar Solo: Murs & Lou Gramm of Foreigner]
Go
Just go

[Chorus: Lou Gramm of Foreigner]
He's gonna keep on rocking
Ain't never gonna stop
Got to keep on rocking
Someday he's gonna make it to the top
And be a DJ hero (eyes)
DJ hero (stars)
DJ hero (stars) he's got stars in his eyes
Stars in his eyes
Come alive tonight
