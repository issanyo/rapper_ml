[Hook]
Fool's gold
Digging for soul
Cause I lost my own
And I can't get home
See I'm blinded by gold
That fool's gold
Is out of control
That fool's gold
Oh, oh, oh

[Murs]
Foolâ€™s Gold Fe S2
I wrote this rhyme inside a test tube

[Wrekonize]
And checked through the list of stones and step stools
To climb up the ladder and batter the best crews

[Bernz]
I never gave a fuck always lit the fuse
And I customized all the shit I used
Prostitutes wait for that dude
Now won't hesitate when the stakes high noon

[Murs]
Tombstone, Holliday Doc
Fuck all these rappers with the diamonds in their watch
Hot, hot, hot, shit on beats
Throw my headphones on and rock some Mobb Deep

[Wrekonize]
The quiet storm will creep and break down the breach
Get 'em out of the darkness, pull 'em out of their seats
I think we got a little soul in the streets
But I keep on digging to the middle of the beef, singing

[Hook]

[Bernz]
New kid on the 145
Living outta bottle with a genie on my side

[Wrekonize]
And a bunch of graffiti on my ride
A beanie on my mind and the need to be alive

[Murs]
Thank God I survived, last night was a close call
35 in the ride and I dozed off
Woke up in the lost and found
Fell deep in some pussy and I almost drowned

[Bernz]
Bad influence that's how I been to it
Blinded by the gold so I been through it
Now I gotta little leeway on freeways
Zen Buddhist approach to these DJ's

[Wrekonize]
See they don't understand how we relay
It's all about the he say she say, replay
Bring it all back down for the goals
Hope I never have to sell my soul and it goes

[Hook]
