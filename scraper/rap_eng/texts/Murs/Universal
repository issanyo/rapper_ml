[Intro]
Get 'em up y'all, get 'em up y'all
This one's for all y'all, hands high y'all
Get 'em up y'all, get 'em up y'all
This one's for all y'all, hands high y'all come on

[Verse 1]
Soul smashing through the boombox
Shook the world, every ghetto up rocks (up rocks)
Rebel art fist raised and head bobbing
Beat boxing on Beach Street to beach knocking
Planet rocking
Rock, rock rock, rock on
Artform for the poor, hungry, broken and strong
A song of the voiceless, who'll forever be heard
Over beat breaks on every landscape that's word

I'm saying though, I was just in Shibuya
Seen this kid with an L.A. Symph shirt and some Pumas
Yeah man, way out in Japan
They be rocking Nike dunks, skateboards in their hand man
Rap made an impact all over the world
Enabled me to make these stacks and [?] to these girls
But I also drop pearls, jewels, and gems
Cause it's more than just guns, women, pools and rims

[Chorus]
Universal, taking this around the world
Universal, from the nerds to the valley girls
Universal, from the corn fields to the barber shops
And gritty city streets and the 'Bama boondocks
Universal, taking this all over the globe
Universal, to places that you don't even know
Universal, London, Japan and Amsterdam
It's taking over the world it wasn't even planned

[Verse 2]
Yeah, from ghettos to suburbs
East west to worldwide
New York ghetto China
Puerto Rico [?]
Japanese ichi ni, every country mic check
And through the internet man, we all straight connect (straight connect)
The one's who love the culture, don't abuse, show respect
Thirty years of evolution and it ain't finished yet (no)
Cause the freedom of expression is the soul of hip hop
It speaks every language so it's never gonna stop

They say nothing is sacred and nothing is pure (yep)
That point is taken as the rake in manure
Money with the message of money and self hate
It seems so sacrilegious to even resuscitate it
Definition of music as the voice of a people
Cause right about now it's advertising the illegal as elite
And the feat is just to catch up
Get shot a hundred times and put a platinum plaque up

[Chorus]
Universal, taking this around the world
Universal, from the nerds to the valley girls
Universal, from the corn fields to the barber shops
And gritty city streets and the 'Bama boondocks
Universal, taking this all over the globe
Universal, to places that you don't even know
Universal, London, Japan and Amsterdam
It's taking over the world it wasn't even planned

Some say they used to love her, but do it like a single mother
A phase in your colors [?] the sound of the summer
[?] Timbaland, Tommy, [?] and Kango
Influenced the world thanks to Arsenio

From a, L.A. Symphony to De La Soul
Whether it's, C'est la Vie or Say No Go
We play the role of global earlobe patrol
Unload on different continents and reap the motherload
From audiences in Rome where the peeps like to dance
And the clubs in Long Beach where they crease their pants
We see [?]
Healthy competition is good as long as they clap their hands

The genius of music, the joy it brings
A child's innocent smile, their hopes and dreams
A better tomorrow, a better today
Little [?] say "What's up" when you're on your way

[Chorus]
Universal, taking this around the world
Universal, from the nerds to the valley girls
Universal, from the corn fields to the barber shops
And gritty city streets and the 'Bama boondocks
Universal, taking this all over the globe
Universal, to places that you don't even know
Universal, London, Japan and Amsterdam
It's taking over the world it wasn't even planned
