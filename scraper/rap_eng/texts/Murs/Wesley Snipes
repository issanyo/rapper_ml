Trap, trap, they say they gettin paid, yo
But if they trapped, that means they stuck, that means they can't go
Overseas where they claim to spend that bankroll
Claimin they some real D-boys but they ain't so
STOP lyin! Nope, we not buyin
That hardcore image when you soft as Kobe Bryant
Put a shirt on, and stop frontin with yo' wack-ass
Can't nobody read them tattoos on yo' black ass

[Chorus]
GETCHO MONEY, GETCHO PAPER
GETCHO MUTHAFUCKIN GRIND ON MY NIGGAAAAAA!! - And stop hatin
GETCHO MONEY, GETCHO PAPER
GETCHO MUTHAFUCKIN GRIND ON MY NIGGAAAAAA!! - And stop hatin
GETCHO MONEY, GETCHO PAPER
GETCHO MUTHAFUCKIN GRIND ON MY NIGGAAAAAA!! - And stop hatin
GETCHO MONEY, GETCHO PAPER
GETCHO MUTHAFUCKIN GRIND ON MY NIGGAAAAAA!! - But pay your taxes

These white hipster niggas, they really think you're cute
Blonde grils with no ass wearin daisy dukes
Your whole fanbase got V-necks and tongs on
Thought it be nice, if you could remix "The Thong Song"
And all these blogs that would dare to call it classic
Must be runnin downstairs wearin clogs on acid
Straight trippin, nope you ain't Crippin
Why I gotta be a Blood when you ain't never live it, nigga

[Chorus]

They got Wesley Snipes, they got James Brown
Even try to get Ms. Hill, they ain't playin 'round!
Just because you paid don't mean that they won't take you down
These motherfuckers love the green, but they hate the brown
Hell, they even truied to get Willie Nel'
Government hate anybody tryna think for themselves
You can pay 'em now, or you can pay the bail
So I pay it and I pray I don't end up in jail
You get your money but you best to invest it right
Free Wesley Snipes (Free Wesley Snipes)
