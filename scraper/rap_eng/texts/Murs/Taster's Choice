"Waitin' for the days" - Funkdoobiest 'Dedicated'

[Verse One] [MURS]
Me, I'm waitin' for the taste of some Naked Juice
Had beef with beef so we made a truce
Cut it all lose back in '93
Now, I don't eat them and they don't eat me
Stopped eatin' pork because of P.E
Haven't had ham since I heard Chuck D
Still I've waitin' for the taste of a fried Spam sandwich
Breakfast and lunch just so moms could manage
God damn it
I miss pepperoni pizza
But I started readin' books by ?Ema Misa?
Quit eatin' chicken but it didn't get cheaper
Eatin' right is expensive
You better not sleep cause
Health and wealth go hand in hand
At first my family didn't understand
Now my mom is a vegetarian
So is my brother
But I still got love for all of y'all meat lovers

[Hook 1] [MURS]
"Waitin' for the days"
Of a blunt with hash
"Waitin' for the days"
Of some greener grass
"Waitin' for the days"
A delicious bass
"Waitin' for the days"
I'm just talkin' out my ass

[Hook 2] [Sunspot Jonz]
"Waitin' for the days"
Of the drinks we toast
"Waitin' for the days"
Of the night to show
"Waitin' for the days"
Of the the life that grows
"Waitin' for the days"
Of her lips, let's go

"Waitin' for the days" [x4]

[Verse Two] [Sunspot Jonz]
Yo, I'm waiting for the days of that hip hop music
Fuck the radio
All you bump is bullshit
I'm bumpin' KMD to the +Peach Fuzz+ love
Damn we full of vibes so it's time to huddle up
So black with my ? some will root to a tree
People think they know but it's never what it seems
Arata come back
Damn my brother where you at?
Japan, there's no weed so the bammer is like crack
To a person coming here
Smoking Cali chronic
I was 14 tryin' to get up on it
Girls hate girls I ain't gonna front no mo'
She didn't like baby from the moment through the do'
I'm waiting for the taste of some cool and calm
No weapons in Iraq so why we drop the bomb?
And my homie had to die over gas price high
If I earn your heart than your soul is my pride
When you waltz eye to eye
Hands to the sky
Waitin' for the taste of Naomi's apple pie
Goodbye
Alright
No lie

[Luckyiam.PSC]
I'm waitin' on the taste of them big bucks
I mean, you know it's lifetime for your boy Luck
Cause I remember strugglin' right now
With no wonder when we hollered double bike style
They want a taste

[Hook 3] [Luckyiam.PSC]
"Waitin' for the days"
Of all the things we invented
"Waitin' for the days"
Of how our style is recommended
"Waitin' for the days"
Of how we ripped down them shows
"Waitin' for the days"
Of how we pull all the hoes
"Waitin' for the days"
Of how we do it all day
"Waitin' for the days"
Of how we made it in the Bay
"Waitin' for the days"
While y'all always fall off
"Waitin' for the days"
Your crew will always be soft

[Verse Three] [Luckyiam.PSC]:
I'm waitin' for the taste of being celibate
Naw, I'm lyin', I just say that for the fuck of it
I pocketed my ego
When it rocketed to where they couldn't fuck with me
It sat outside of pocket
I had to face reality
And actually I'm better now
Better off I get it off
I'mma let it out
Watch me shout
It's something that I crave
I'll never be a slave
And behave for no reason but to please him and her
Get it blurred, your perception of our thoughts is disturbed
Our thoughts is disturbed
