[Produced By Curtiss King]

[Verse One]
She got a Fat Booty
It's Black On Both Sides
She posting pics on Instagram with them open thighs
You know I don't mind
The eye candy
I'm from west L.A
She from south Miami
No and he's fucked around and her account deleted
Shout out to Hollywood Ho and the crew, Treated
I don't play for pussy
But yeah I fucking eat it
Now she cooking breakfast in my sweats
Undefeated
Private parking
There ain't no walk of shame
Got that guard at the gate, there ain't no stalker games
And if she don't got brains
Then she don't got game
She's sucking dick for bottle service that's so fucking lame

[Hook] {x2}
I've 'bout mo' Taylor Swift than Beyonce
Don't need no meat on my entree
I guarantee what my rhymes say
Mos definitely that's Dante
Mos Def my nigga that's Dante
Mos definitely that's Dante
Mos Def my nigga
Mos definitely
Mos Def my nigga that's Dante

[Verse Two]
She got a Fat Booty
I'm so ecstatic
She got that New World Water, what's the Mathematics?
True Magic
She newly tatted
Plus she keep a head wrap
Erykah Badu status
Conscious flow
Fuck you obnoxious hoes
I want a chick with some knowledge and some perfect toes
That mani/pedi game gotta be righteous
Cross fit put a fat ass on white chick
Do them squats girl
And rap
Zero carbs, paleo she ain't got no fat
A strong woman?
That's The New Danger
Real niggas love her
Bitch niggas gotta hate her

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
She got a Fat Booty
It's black and tan
Coming straight outta Brazil, now I'm a Travellin' Man
Selfies in the mirror, looking healthy from the rear
She the type that got me on a flight twice a year
I say "Brigada."
She say "De nada."
Portuguese and Spanish, "[?], hold my enchilada."
I wish Cube fucked J.Lo in Anaconda
So my black mamba could hit Sofia Vergara
Colombiana
Zoe Saldana
Watching 8thstreetlatinas, that's my favorite genre
But love my Black Star, she the X rated kind
Brown Skin Lady, if you ask her she won't say she mind

[Hook]

I want my people to be
To be, to be
I want my black people to be
To be, to be
I want my people to be
To be, to be
I want my people to be
To be, to be free

My umi says {x6}
Shine your swag on the world
Shine your swag for the world to see

Ohh yeah yeah
