[Hook - Big Brooklyn Red]
I let the beast out the box
I can't chain it, chain it, no
I can't hold him back
I can't put him down

[Wrekonize]
Break, I been holding on
To a soul down low like a loaded gun
I'mma take a step closer from
The soft spoken one that I've slow become

[Bernz]
Snakes, and the new fugazis
Why they gotta provoke me, try and tame me?
Fate and the blocks that made me
Won't let me go down like these ladies

[Murs]
Hate, it’s all around me
The evil’s closing in and it tried to drown me
Wait, I let God surround me
The devil had me down but I’m glad he found me

[Wrekonize]
Shake, everything I was
And every little bit of me you see I love

[Bernz]
I'mma make a move on the spot
Running up the plot, coming up outta the box

[Hook x2]

[Wrekonize]
Here comes the rattling, here comes the pain
Here comes the handling, don't fear the rain
Cause it was bound to change
Couldn't hold it all in so I broke the chain

[Bernz]
These boys are shattering these barricades
B-boys are traveling to outer space
We had to make our own lane
Drive without headlights, turn a road unpaved

[Murs]
In comes the chattering into my brain
It doesn’t matter they call me insane
What they think it’s a game
Going full beast mode for the money and fame

[Wrekonize]
Get up I'm battering, in such a way

[Bernz]
The Tin cups and damning em, fix up your fangs

[Murs]
Take a bite out the game
New rules new aim and a gang called Strange

[Hook x2]
