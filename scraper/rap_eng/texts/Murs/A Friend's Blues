[Intro]

[Verse 1: Murs]
Now when you're young, death can make you aware of your mortality
At times we feel invincible, lose sight of reality
Until it takes a loved one, residing in our circle
It'll hurt you cause you miss 'em
Once were close, down you're distant
And it hurts just to know that they could go at any instant
Gotta love 'em by the minute, now you realize this
It's sad it takes a loss to appreciate the gifts
So celebrate the occasion, just breathing is amazin'
To see the sun rise and set, at a days end
A chance to fix mistakes that we regret makin'
Find joy in the simple things, no time for complainin'
The sun will shine, it can't always be rainin'
I know it hurts deep, but you must maintain it
I seen it in my homeboys Terry and Tom
They've lost so many, yet they keep so strong
To lose a parent or a sibling and have the will to keep living
Takes so much strength, so I admire y'all
And one day hope to find out, what is (bias?) y'all
And I'm still mad, askin' why it happens at all
Some say that God takes them, and they lean on mythology
But I choose to believe that its divine lottery
I can't believe God's lookin' down, waitin' to slaughter me
I can't live in fear, and I can't live here
Forever, so I treasure every moment

[Hook: Murs]
And it's friendship, that I value the most
That kinship, the ones we hold close
And dear, and fear the most of losin'
But keep chewin'
The memories brewin', cause life keeps movin'on

And it's friendship, that I value the most
That kinship, the ones we hold close
And dear, and fear the most of losin'
But keep chewin'
The memories brewin', cause life keeps movin'on

[Verse 2: Murs]
We came together like family, like it was our first death
Unexpected, so quick, so sudden, the worst yet
Didn't get to know the girl, 'til years after her first breath
Still we loved her like a sister, as a depth of first steps
Got the call out of town, so alone I first wept
Deep pain, from the same place, is where this verse crept
Never slept in that bed again
The memory was too tragic, looked up and screamed goodbye
Knew you wouldn't be present at the wake, in your casket
Now you're askin' things change since you left, not really
We still playin' games, BSin', actin' silly
See she don't talk to her and, she don't like me and
Will we work things out, thats not likely
I mean where will we start
Do we mend friendships, or let things fall apart
Will we still be in touch, honestly I don't know
But you're in my heart forever

[Hook: Murs]
It's friendship, that I value the most
That kinship, the ones we hold close
And dear, and fear the most of losin'
But keep chewin'
The memories brewin', cause life keeps movin'on

And it's friendship, that I value the most
That kinship, the ones we hold close
And dear, and fear the most of losin'
But keep chewin'
The memories brewin', cause life keeps movin'on

And it's friendship, that I value the most
That kinship, the ones we hold close
And dear, and fear the most of losin'
But keep chewin'
Pour out a little brew and blow a blunt while your cruisin'
For friends that you're choosin', gotta love 'em 'fore you lose 'em
Stand strong when you do it, tough times, live through 'em
Don't give into 'em, stay goal pursuin' and
Doin' what your doin' cause life keeps movin' on
