[Verse 1]
The legend says that his name brings fame
To any soul willing to pay the price of the game
Risk so much to gain so little
The devil always plays both fins against the fiddle
He's been around for years, deceiving, receiving
As soon as you think you're getting even, he's leaving
Greed and lust are the tools that he uses
Manipulating men in any way that he chooses
The law of run, is no fun
They only teach the shortcut where he comes from
You cash out quick and hopefully leave a cute corpse
No consequence to a life cut short
Life after death, it belongs to him
The end is never sweet and what you reap is grim
They say you can't cheat death and you can't cheat him
The end is never sweet when the reaper's in

[Hook]
We live fast, we die young
We buy coke, and tote guns
Why walk, when you can run
Since we all gotta die then why not have fun
We live fast, we die young
We buy coke, and tote guns
Why walk, when you can run
(Run, run, run, run)

[Verse 2]
The cars, the cash, the chicks, the weed
Name anything you want and he's got what you need
The "M" is for materialistic, he brings mass amounts of money to the misfits
Mortal men trying to match his greed
But they wind up dead because they don't take heed
He misleads them, he misguides them
His passion is power and it won't be denied him
He was in love once, if you could call it that
Took what he wanted and he never did call her back
But then again he was fucking with the goddess
Hell hath fury but a fire burns the hottest
A goddess, scorned, vengeance now born
Beware of her wrath the wise men once warned
Mortals play pawn while the gods keep score
They says alls fair when true love is at war

[Hook]
We live fast, we die young
We buy coke, and tote guns
Why walk, when you can run
Since we all gotta die then why not have fun
We live fast, we die young
We buy coke, and tote guns
Why walk, when you can run
(Run, run, run, run)

[Outro]
(Run, run, run, run, run, run)
