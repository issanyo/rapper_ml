"I know" [x13]

[Verse One] [MURS]
Now I know I don't love you like you love me
But I like what we got and I would hate if it got ugly
Other than that (What?)
I really don't know shit
Except I like my warm hugs from a real cold bitch
Not cold as in ice or cold as in demeanor
But cold as in you gotta look twice when you see her
Agree to stuff you wouldn't agree ta
In your right mind
Greet her and whenever you meet her, a little light shines
Pipe line dreamin' on a California sunset
Walkin' hand in hand, all we missin' is that one step
But commitment is forbidden
For a travel ridden rhyme writer, I'm hopin' that in hindsight (What?)
I didn't overlook the one
So I'm goin' overboard hopin' that we overcome
If it's over and it's done, overall it was fun
But I'm over thinkin' now so I hope the hook will come

[Hook] [MURS]
And I (I know)
The God in me (I know)
The God in you (I know)
Is, hard to see (I)
All the wrong we do but
(Know) Time will tell and
(I Know) Lies will fell if
(I Know) I prevail
(Know) I owe it all to myself

[Bridge]
Now all you ever really know is that you don't know shit
And the more you don't know, the closer that you get
The closer that you come, the further that it seems
And you tripin' because you're just a thought's distance from your dreams

[Verse Two] [MURS]
The God in me
The God in you
Is, hard to see, all the wrong we do
The strong are few, but the weak so numerous
We steady losin' people to this evil that's consumin' us
Trust in the creator
And the beauty in yourself
Try to see it in your neighbor
I'm a Raider of a lost star
Header for your pop chart
Simple twist of fate away from workin' at your Wal-Mart
Thanksgiving everyday that I'm livin'
The life, the dream
Of what seems to be division
The goal, the game plan
On the whole, I'm a changed man
Had to gain control, a lost soul in a strange land
I found discipline
I found Nick again
A sound system, and a, crowd listenin'
A fish to water it, rip and slaughter it
And those that didn't witness are gonna wish that they saw the shit but

[Hook] [MURS]
And I (I know)
The God in me (I know)
The God in you (I know)
Is, hard to see (I)
All the wrong we do but
(Know) Time will tell and
(I Know) Lies will fell if
(I Know) I prevail
(Know) I owe it all to myself
