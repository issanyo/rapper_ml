Locks, braids, twists, dreads
Everybody askin' me what's on my head
All in ma bizness, worse than the feds
Lemme do me and get this bread
No matter what's said
I know my hair fly
Everybody stare when they walk by
Dreadlocks fallin all ova me
I'm pullin mo' freaks then jodasee
They stop what they doin just to notice me
The center of attention like I'm pose'd to be
Don't be made cause ya fade played out
Even A.I. wanna take his braids out (look at em)
Let it lock up
Throw ya block up
It's all peace
So put ya Glock up
It's big murs and rick rock
Everybody watch when I fall through tha spot

Dredlocks falling all over me
I got dredlocks falling all over me
I got dredlocks falling all over me
I got dredlocks falling all over me (and if you got em, then you gotta swing em side to side)
I got dredlocks falling all over me
I got dredlocks falling all over me
I got dredlocks falling all over me
I got dredlocks falling all over me
I got dredlocks falling all over me (and if you got em, then you gotta swing em side to side)
I got...

Now people try to tell me that I'm being rebellious
My hair too wild, and I'm over zealous
But Bob Marley had em, he doper than Elvis
NFL players got em under they helmets
Celebratin in tha endzone
Some people say they give you powers like Zeus
You say they ugly, but cha girl say they handsome
Ask ma man Pacman Jones in Atlanta
College graduates goin' down to the Bammas
You could speak proper or that country grammer (rite thur)
You could have none or you can have just one
But everybody know dreads have mo fun
Mac Dre had em
Ya boy sway got em
You could separate
Or twist em down to the bottom
Or let em go crazy; like I got mine
Some people got a hundred, I got about nine

Jesus Christ had...
Bob Marley had...
It may be a style, but it's not a fad
It's my heritage, it's the way that I wear it is
Jus like ma Great, Great Grandparents did
They used to tell us kids
That it was Shameful
How you tell a Lion not to let his Mane grow
Asians, Jamicans, even the Anglos
All Gettin Irie and lettin it Tangle
They it's strange so you won't except it
Groups And Culture, You will respect it
Pick up a book, learn about Selassie
You ain't Gotta Smoke weed to read Marcus Garvey
It's Rastafari
And we ain't all high
Jus tryna uplift
Fore' we all die
It's nothin to hide
You wear em with pride
And if you got em, then you gotta swing side to side. C'mon

(Man it's not a hairstyle man, it's a movement man, it's about havin fun, bein rightous, peace and love, And I don't care what anybody else say, real real talk!)

(and if you got em, then you gotta swing em side to side)...
