[Verse 1: Murs]
Fly like a condor, fly like a eagle
Fly in an 85' candy painted Regal
Fly like a dove, I come from up above
I'm rappin' on the mic and you can call me Murs Love
I run this house, I'm dumbin' out
I can make your girl come keep my tongue in my mouth (whoa)
I'm that cold with it, 23 below with it, snow ball effect I suggest that ya'll roll with it
It's gettin' bigger man, it's a movement, it's called the President I'ma show you how to do it (watch)
You put your tie on, get your fly on, she say D.J. he play my song
Long time comin', but I been runnin', hands underground like Harriet Tubman
Never been thuggin' ya'll niggas buggin', there's too many fine ass women in this club cause

[Hook: Murs]
(I'm lookin' fly) Oooh, I'm 'bout to spread my wings
(I'm lookin' fly) Oooh, I'm 'bout to spread my wings

I'm lookin' fly, lookin', lookin', lookin' (fly, fly, fly, fly)
Lookin' fly

[Verse 2: Murs]
Like zero gravity, laid back everything flow to me naturally
Yep like that girl you tried to mac to I applied my G-force and she flew right past you
Didn't think that she would do that
Now you hatin' on me at the bar askin' "who that?"
Rock star my hair out of control, you just another rapper dude playin' a roll
I'm eclectic, eccentric, thrift store expensive
You just one dimension you ain't this extensive
Limited. Your world is this big, you ain't left your block since you were a little kid
You wanna see the world your girl wanna live
I Grabbed her hand lead her to the floor and we gigged
Spread my wings like Andr√© Hicks
Getting play on both coasts like the L.A. Knicks

[Hook: Murs]
(I'm lookin' fly) Oooh, I'm 'bout to spread my wings
(I'm lookin' fly) Oooh, I'm 'bout to spread my wings
(I'm lookin' fly) Oooh, I'm 'bout to spread my wings
(I'm lookin' fly) Ooh I'm lookin'... yeah
(I'm lookin' fly) Yeah I'm 'bout to spread my wings
(I'm lookin' fly) Yeah I'm 'bout to spread my wings
(I'm lookin' fly) Watch a nigga spread my wings
I'm lookin' fly, lookin', lookin', lookin' (fly, fly, fly, fly)
Lookin' fly

[Verse 3: Murs]
Fly like Delta
Fly like Continental
Known to take flight on a fly instrumental
Fly super fly I leap over skyscrapers
Write fly rhymes on sheets of fly paper
Peter Pan fly you never seen a man fly think happy thoughts while you just fly stand by
I flew all around the world but you can't be a fly dude with out a fly girl Cmon'
{Ya'll really need to step ya'll female game up. Forget your diamonds}
My Brazilian she worth a few million
Beauty and brains might let her have my children
Walked in the building treated like a villain
Cause my light skin cute thing from Crenshaw killed 'em
I shut it down man please
You ain't never seen a Asian girl with natural D's {Look at her}
See my Philippino, my Pinay, my mahal My Manila on the dance floor havin' a ball

[Hook: Murs]
(I'm lookin' fly) Oooh, I'm 'bout to spread my wings
(I'm lookin' fly) Oooh, I'm 'bout to spread my wings
(I'm lookin' fly) Oooh, I'm 'bout to spread my wings
(I'm lookin' fly) Ooh I'm lookin'... yeah
(I'm lookin' fly) Yeah I'm 'bout to spread my wings
(I'm lookin' fly) Yeah I'm 'bout to spread my wings
(I'm lookin' fly) Watch a nigga spread my wings
I'm lookin' fly, lookin', lookin', lookin' (fly, fly, fly, fly)
Lookin' fly
