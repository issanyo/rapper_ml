[Verse 1: Murs]
This sound like summertime, sound like a picnic
Bloods and crips at the park just kicking it
You ain't from my city if you never heard of 'key the rock'
You ain't from my city if you never heard of Cedar Block
Havin' birthday parties up at Kenneth, huh
It's all about the kids so we all get along
Chillin' with your red or blue fitted on
Even though it's a powder keg that we sittin' on
Oh, it's a fight? Then everybody fighting
We all jumpin' in even if we don't like it
If you from the block then you got his back
If that's how you rock then holla back
And don't nobody want no problems, Jack
A game of dominoes, and a lot of yak
Been a minute since the riots and all of that
Nine deuce truce, about time that we brought it back

[Hook: Kam]
(Niggas showin' up, from this gang and that gang
Nobody set-trippin', 'cause it's a black thang
Niggas showin' up, from this gang and that gang
Nobody set-trippin', 'cause it's a black thang
Blue and red everywhere, look how strong we are)

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
Sound like Grizzly city in the summer, don't it?
Whip out the 5 point 0, swing another donut
You ain't from my city if you never heard of 'First Street'
You ain't from my city if you never heard of 'Chris' Meat'
Fool, birthdays up in Homespark
Khaki's with overblown starch
Throw 'em from the shoulders with the little homie
Show' em he ain't gotta let his chrome spark
Back in 9-2
Every young nigga I knew, bang red or blue
Every young killer I knew had a bulletproof
But why at the barbecue we had to let it loose?
Huh, really? I'm not interested in the drama
Wait a sec, just spotted my next baby mama
I'mma, marinate with this 40 ounce
Later I be layin' up in shorty house, fool

[Hook: Kam]
(Niggas showin' up, from this gang and that gang
Nobody set-trippin', 'cause it's a black thang
Niggas showin' up, from this gang and that gang
Nobody set-trippin', 'cause it's a black thang
Blue and red everywhere, look how strong we are)

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
Okay, where was I, now we at the crib
Finally got me alone, body outta this world
Lil mama was gone, blame Malibu beach
For a sentiment tone, I had to get me a taste
But it really couldn't wait, uh
She had dubble D's, no waist
Georgia peach with a California face
It's like I escape when I'm inside her
Ayo, Murs, she remind me of a Impala

[Verse 4: Murs]
Hold the one that just came out the bathroom, huh
The fly one with the tattoo on the thigh
Light skin girl, turned her red in the sun
(?) on with her hair in a bun
You see the babygirl on the vaseline
Those Asian dudes got me thinking nasty things
We two-stepping to the sunset
Been at it all day, but we ain't done yet

[Hook: Kam]
