[Verse 1: Anacron]
I love it when I do a show and there's a black crowd
I love when fools act out and start to rap loud in a wack style
My rhymes are so fresh you can hear the pages flipping in the background (I don't give a fuck)
I am that proud
A mack bound, nose up, head in a fat cloud (thats how I love it)
I ain't coming back down
On the ground I walk around loving the natural high
I love it when people point and say, "that's a cool guy"
I love watching ? have his apple moon pie
And females with a fat ass and huge thighs
Not to exclude the slimmy's cuz you can give me some skinny cooch
I love that too
It's all stunning to me
When y'all running to see L U B
Im called one and a G
I'm all hung in the jeans
And uh, I show love and lovely

[Verse 2: Anacron]
I love women, I love women
I love sinning, but then and again I repent (never regret)
When the past passes and the last glasses of soda have become passed gasses
I love when fools I know like to make dumb ass asses of themselves
I tell a fool to go rub himself before rubbing me wrong
Got you loving these songs
These beats up and be bomp
Get your Dub and G on
Me I'm hugging Fees on GP
Scheming for one minute in the club and be gone
I love a different type of atmosphere
Anacron, blue coat, locs and cashmere
And dress slacks
I love telling rappers to get back
I don't wear hip hop I'm a HepCat with a rep that
Ain't based on what I wear
But on the fact that I love to serve that nigga over there
Then snuff the turd like, "I love you cuz you ain't shit
And I'd love to give you this free CD cuz I know you'll hate it"
