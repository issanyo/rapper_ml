[Intro]
What up though
It's Murs, 9th Wonder
Murs 3:16, the 9th Edition
Shhhhhhh, shut your fat mouth, and listen

[Verse 1]
Anticipation got the deck stacked against me since the outset
9th got 'em fiending for an instrumental version of an album that ain't out yet
But now it's my outlet, and it feels so good
To them punk fans, when I'm still so hood
So hood it's ridiculous, still iniculous
That means 3 times doper than your favorite MC riding round with a chauffeur
These niggas need Jesus, fuck it, niggas need Oprah
All this killing and this pimping and these foul ways of living
See, everyone's forgetting that the struggle's not over
I got sober, then got drunk again
Got my boy from Carolina, picked up the pen
Threw my nuts on the finish line, I come to win
While you nuttin' to lose, I'll shake you out your shoes
With ease, with moves parallel to those and other three
Couldn't wait for George to make the new Star Wars scene
So I made my own episode 3:16
To answer all the rumors that been shooting through your group:
Yes 9th really does make these beats on Fruity Loops
But what does that matter? this is more than music
By buying this disc you have bought into a movement
Not a revolutionary, nothing but the truth I carry
Change if you wanna change, that karma is for you to carry
All I'm trying to do is lighten your load
So in between I'm getting faded, some of y'all getting blowed
But I couldn't fall off and lose sight of my goals
So I got sober, got drunk again
Murs 3:16, let the fun begin
