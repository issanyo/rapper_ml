I’ve seen good men turn bad, and bad men do good
Rich men with nothing and poor man with gold
Nothing surprises me no mo'
I seen players get played out and fast girls go slow
Things I thought priceless, get bought or get sold
Nothing surprises me no more

[Verse 1: Murs]
When we first met she was just a kid
She was in love with everything I did
Used to come through drink 40's at the crib
Asked her to fuck the homie and of course she did
We would slide through the city in my Benz
Acting like we was just friends
After all that time we would spend
I would hate to see her with other men
I would get a little jealous I would hit her on the celly
We would smash all night listenin to R. Kelly
Could have locked it down but I just wasn't ready
She was too young whatn't nothing you could tell me
Had to let her go to know what I had
Type the shit to make a real good girl go bad
When I look back bro I get so mad
I seen a ho become the housewife I wish I had

[Verse 2: Murs]
''Put me on ''Paid Dues'' Big Homie!
One Shot, let the whole world know me!''
So humble when he first approached me
So I looked out like I should I'm an OG
Put him on, put them on
Nowadays niggas can't pick up phones
Hurts my heart, I ain't mad tho'
I'm glad they got on and increased their cash flow
I ain't shamed, I ain't bashful
I could drop names, I could be that asshole
After all you'd think they'd be thankful
But hoes ain't loyal and niggas ain't grateful
I ain't hateful, way too blessed
Still getting mine so I ain't stressed
It's documented in the streets and they put it in the press
That I played a big part on why it's poppin' on the West
God bless
