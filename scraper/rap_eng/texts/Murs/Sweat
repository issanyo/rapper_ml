[Hook: Sunspot Jonz]
Now I see
These days
Love unbound
Can't escape

[Verse One: Sunspot Jonz]
You gotta sweat it out, let it out
Move it out, do it out
Break it out, head it out
Do it slow, what you know?
What you show on the M-I, N to the D
You ain't fucking with me
Like my ex-girlfriend
[?] psychologies with [?] degrees of funk
Peace to the underground crunk
Where we rock it down, r-r-rock it down
R-r-rock it down,r-r-rock it down
Oakland to LA
I'm straight in the California sun rays
Holidays on written sonics
[?]
Tryna change the world, think
If you feel the drama, think
If you love yourself, think
If you want to make a difference make a different outlook
You wanna be crook, still the days that it took
To get your family where they have
Shit to hail, shit to scale, shit to handrail
Ran up on my tail
Life is too short
Every time I'm on a plane
I think I'm not gonna make it
But I can't let [?] make it
My pride, shit no lie, until the day I die
It's a family affair like Sly

[Hook: Sunspot Jonz]
Now I see
These days
Love unbound
Can't escape

[Verse Two: Luckyiam.PSC]
Since the mercury rose
The crowds explode
And the loaded heat rows
To the day it pours
Rain stores, rainstorms, figure out the riddle
I move in good clothes and choose to stash the piddle
With the monitor I monitor the venue or some
Partake in indo, while others innuendo
A window, a new beginning
I'm winning, not five precent
I'm bending  my will power pretending living and giving my all
Attracting women again and again, the legends
Effortless evidence, isn't it how it should be?
Come on people, could we?
Have a little moment of your precious time
Swear that I'll unearth it in the afterlife

[Hook: Sunspot Jonz]
Now I see
These days
Love unbound
Can't escape
Now I see
These days
Love unbound
Can't escape
(Yeah we gonna slow it down)

[Verse Three: The Grouch]
I'mma let these toxins out
Because there ain't no way I can get high off of hotbox and doubt
Fear and negativity
Living inside me is an art
I don't gotta kick start
Like a water drip mark I make imprints in time
And it's on your mind with the simplest rhymes
I'm digging a ditch to bury treasure in
Measure it up over my last efforts all for self pleasuring
Who's up for bettering  the planet with a slick outlook on situations
So familiar like damn it I feel ya
Sweat drips down the brow
I'm accomplished now
I'm not swamped it's a challenge to make it happen
You need a balance to feel my rapping
Killer adapting skill
Never the yap and thrill of filling the space
I'm still in place of living for the love
Giving what I got and sweating out the bud

[Hook: Sunspot Jonz]
Now I see
These days
Love unbound
Can't escape
Now I see
These days
Love unbound
Can't escape

[Verse Four: Murs]
It's like "yes sir"
Murs is fresh as Fred Segal
With the mic spread eagle so you know I had to bless her
Money shot
Luckyiam
To stand with The Grouch on a track made by Sunspot
Making Magic
Wreaking havoc on the live stage
With the DNA when 18 was my age
Three years away from legal, three years away from evil
Raise the ignorance level and I might have to see you
But I think now
You let your mind drift
I think straight shots
More valuable than gold
Cuervo
I downed it with my family surrounded
Don't feel I'm being punished just cause I'm underground
In five years of restriction
My tears and affliction
Like fear with my diction
Stand clear of the friction
Don't need no static
(No no)
Cause when you fall off and lose it we still gon' have it
