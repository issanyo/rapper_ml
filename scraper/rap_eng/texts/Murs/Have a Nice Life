[Verse 1]
God is great, and I'm grateful
I could never be so hateful
I got some cute kids and a woman who is faithful
Food up on my table, my bank account is stable
Royalty check, Strange Music is the label
Music on point, so now your boy is able
To be broadcast on your satellite and cable
''Radio friendly,'' the phrase used to offend me
But now I'm getting spins cause I knew I had it in me
Industry on envy, my foes wanna friend me
Money saying spend me, the homie saying give me
And I would still be rapping if I never made a penny
Believe it when I say it when I say it make it real
If I could do it all over I would still take the deal
For that type of opportunity a lot of kids would kill
But I would never murder, I would much rather yield
I don't wanna rule the realm
I just wanna ride the storm and let God take the helm
Tell my sons to be better than their old man was
And pray to get to do the things an old man does
I don't wanna hide my gray, I don't wanna dye my hair
Cause a lot of my homies died before they got there
I carry on the legacy, our only goal to set us free
And drop another classic after 30 years of pregnancy
Classic is creation, all creation is a classic
Especially when the track is tuned in to the master
The master being love and love being light
And everyone's got opinions, we all love being right
And we love what we learn, making wrong turns in life
I earn what I earn, I ain't concerned with the hype
Fight with a open heart, love with a open mind
You gotta trust that you know when to start and where to draw the line
And when it's your time, make peace with it
Never worry bout the perfect life, let the priest live it
Give it time, let it work itself out
Meditate on the better things, never dwell in self-doubt
Sitting here waiting on you
Because if love brought us up, what's hatin' gonna do?
So you should hate a few and try to love many more
And always let karma settle any score

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Give me war, I give you peace
We give the most to those who need the least
You didn't speak up when they held me down
So you should keep your mouth shut while I hold the crown
And if you helped me down when I was down trotting
You'll always be around, you'll never be forgotten
I put the fame last and I made God first
Cause that's how my brother said relationships should work
Working overtime cause I'm hoping over time
That my work will respected and the world will know that I'm
The California kid that went and did the impossible
The coast crowned me king cause I conquered every obstacle

[Outro]
