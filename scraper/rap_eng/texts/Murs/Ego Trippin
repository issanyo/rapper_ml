[Chorus: Shake Deville]
Yo, we got the full metal jacket rap, take over your area
Amateurs, get back in the house, you know you scared of the
Official rhyme killing spree, the chemistry will bury ya
And we get props from Los Angeles to Bulgaria
Full metal jacket rap, take over your area
Amateurs, get back in the house, you know you scared of the
Official rhyme killing spree, the chemistry will bury ya
And we get props from Los Angeles to Bulgaria

[Verse 1: Murs]
Shh... I got something to show you
It's about how to bust since nobody told you
I see you stumble and you mumble over tracks without enunciating
Rhyming like a run on sentence without no punctuation
And I'm a comma, pause
Show you how to do this, period
Capital R.I.P. this something serious
No funnies and no moneys, I wasn't paid to spit this
Did this out of love and respect, for the Chemist
You know Murs is a hymnist
Now open up your books to Psalm 3:16
And start uplifting His great name (Yes!)
Like money, hate fame
My advice to all you up and coming artists in the game
Get out while you ahead fool, go to med school
Use that tool to save the world, you don't wanna go on tour
And have to play with these girls, or, maybe you do
But say that your crew is mine, that's a room full of six's
And only one dime, split that eight ways
That's a cent and some pay pennies
Put down that mic motherfucker and just play with me
Flagrantly flirting with philosophy and phrases
Far from a fake, I [?] from the fameless
Aimless, ordinary, raps without vocabulary
Long live Murs and death to all his adversaries

[Chorus: Shake Deville]
Yo, we got the full metal jacket rap, take over your area
Amateurs, get back in the house, you know you scared of the
Official rhyme killing spree, the chemistry will bury ya
And we get props from Los Angeles to Bulgaria
Full metal jacket rap, take over your area
Amateurs, get back in the house, you know you scared of the
Official rhyme killing spree, the chemistry will bury ya
And we get props from Los Angeles to Bulgaria

[Verse 2: Soup the Chemist]
My penmanship is like an acid trip
How many tight verses do I have to kick
Before you cats understand I'm a serious arranger
My goal is to take over that CD Changer
The bangers got you feeling like it's a sin to
Take me out and put another artist in
My place, your taste is what I consider
Before I step into this booth and deliver
A rhythm and connection that'll have you put your arms up
Like you know the answer to the question
That's always the intention, study old cuts for clues
Soup homeboy never followed the rules
Fighting to get mine like Palestinians and Jews
[?] unless they're expressed on a check
That's the kinda respect I'm trying to collect
The state of hip-hop got me all upset
My career would be over if it wasn't for the net
I serve and protect just like the law
Diss my style and get socked in the jaw
Dirty like a joke on a bathroom stall

[Chorus: Shake Deville]
Yo, we got the full metal jacket rap, take over your area
Amateurs, get back in the house, you know you scared of the
Official rhyme killing spree, the chemistry will bury ya
And we get props from Los Angeles to Bulgaria
Full metal jacket rap, take over your area
Amateurs, get back in the house, you know you scared of the
Official rhyme killing spree, the chemistry will bury ya
And we get props from Los Angeles to Bulgaria
