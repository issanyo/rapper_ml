[Verse 1: Cynic]
These lames they all trick n ride
With them I don't really vibe
I rather study character
Then drink & try to socialize
My pockets is alright
I got my own fucking high
Got my own bitches too
So homie keep passing me by
It's never personal, I'm telling you why
Cuz I been around the world
And everywhere is the same lie
I been around the world, not everywhere is the same high
If the homies smash your girl
Guaranteed she's gonna tell you bye
These broads love me, cuz I gave 'em the knowledge
I teach 'em things
In a couple months, they gonna learn in college
Explain, create your stories
While she slurping & vibing
We talking religion, science, astrology
Big bang theory, while she moaning & swallowing
She knows I'm from the streets, so she thinks I'm astonishing
I love life, I live it with no limits
When it's all said & done, will they be there when I finish
(when I finish, when I finish)

[Hook]
Yo, I gave you earth lessons, I came to you as a blessing
If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool
You hit like drugs, sexy mothafucka
So we can never be a couple hun
Yo, I gave you earth lessons, I came to you as a blessing
If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool
You hit like drugs, sexy mothafucka
Fuck love, all I got for ho's is hard dick and bubble gum

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
Yo, I lay back in the cut like..
The world is mine, and all I need is one mic
One bottle and one broad, I Just might
I still like to live the single life some nights
Only problem, bitches come back when its done right
Tell 'em what they wanna hear
Verbal skill is dumb nice
Spit in her mouth while digging her out
Dick in the trout
The broads dig it, cuz I'm big in the south
Empty promises, no games
I just can't be honest
It's fuck love
Groupie Puss thrown at the artists (damn)
What am I to do?
When she make it hard
Just one thing to do, stick it in her orifice
I make 'em feel like I love 'em for just a bit
And always lose, when we start to play just the tip
Had good times and got busted a grip
It's your fault cuz you trusted the dick
You're mind fucked bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Murs]
I bet I'll fuck that bitch
Even though she looking at me, like I ain't shit
Look I got more confidence then I got hair
What chu think you a dime bitch? pft I don't care
You can stand over there, thinking you too good
We drinking Hennessy, so you think that we too hood
Like we just some thugs, who ain't about shit
But before you start to judge, let break down your outfit
50 dollar shoes with your 50 dollar dress on
Homemade manicure, nothing but some press-ons
Smelling like the perfume on sale at Sephora
40 Dollar bag but you paid more for it
These Forever 21 broads, ain't about nothin'
That's why they ass will be forever looking for husband
You see 'em mind fuck 'em
Break down their self-esteem
Then build em back up and have playing for your team

[Hook]
