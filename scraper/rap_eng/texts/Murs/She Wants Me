[Verse 1: Bicasso and Luckyiam]

[Bicasso]
Now this a lil doozie
Bout my life the movie
How my wife she knew me
But not like the girls on tour
I make music and see this how it change

[Luckyiam]
But if you wasn't ready
I been there before
I seen her from afar
But im untouchable
Brushed on my arm
Make uncomfortable
I'm kinda like a player
Yep I admit that
Maybe it could work

[Bicasso]
But you don't really want that
It's like magic
You can have it
Three in one night
Then they call it a hat trick

[Luckyiam]
Well I'm Wayne Gretsky
But way too sexy
If I sees drunk
Then she get's naked

[Bicasso]
Damn that's cold
Fine young titter
With her momma at the show
And she wasn't that old

[Luckyiam]
Ooooold
Somebody better hit that
Get that
Get back
Baby we don't need that

[Hook 1: Sunspot]

She wants me
Shocked me
Show me what's happenin

Always ready for action
She wants me
Shocked me
Show me what's happenin

Always ready for action

[Verse 2: MURS and The Grouch]

[MURS]
I got a restraining order on my ex-girlfriend
We had a fight
She pulled the knife
I'm at the precinct again

[The Grouch]
Murs, man, I told you bout the groupies
And homie
That's why I tied the knot
I don't really know why you drive a hooptie
You can have a new benz off the lot

[MURS]
But but the D's on this bitch
She pulled the squeeze on my dick
Grouch, my girlfriend's got a girlfriend
I ain't leaving this chick

[The Grouch]
Well if you keep the girl at somethin
Despite all the dysfunction
She wanna ride the night
Right by your side
So give her what she's wantin

[Hook 2: Sunspot]

Damn near out of my mind
She's got me spending chips on crazy shit

[(girl)]
He got me goin crazy
Damn near out of my mind
He got me spending chips on crazy shit

[Scarub]
If you're lookin for the one, man, she ain't it
She got that look on her face
Like she be smokin that shiiiit
Well if you're lookin for some fun
She's the one to be with

[Eligh]
I agree
I can see her from the stage in a minute

[Scarub]
Met her on myspace
Led her to my place
Fed her my taste
She wasn't a shy date

[Eligh]
Brown hair with a fly face
She stood about 5'8
Too tall for my case
But fuck that, why wait?

[Scarub]
She smelt like butter
Stretched like rubber
Talked real gutter
A freak like no other

[Eligh]
So hot undercover
Not for your mother
Touch her with a 10-foot poll
Don't love her

[Scarub]
She good for the takin
But don't get caught up

[Eligh]
Cause she'll break you
Then make sure you're never brought up

[Scarub]
Yeah i'd hit it
I'd quit it
We come
Tough love

[Eligh]

So what?

Nappy dug out thugged out crown

[Aesop]

Singin songs out loud
Let me know when you bout to feel that wow
How do we make it to my crib somehow
