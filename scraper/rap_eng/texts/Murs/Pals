[Himself: Spoken]
Yeah, Uh, another Netherworlds hit
This is Himself along with Anacron and Murs
What you know about your true homeboys
See friends help you move, and real friends help you move bodies

[Verse 1: Himself]
Your homeboy will come kick it even though you broke
He'll come through with something to do more than just smoke
Laugh at your jokes, cuz your both in the same shit
Don't have to take five minutes to explain it
Your homeboys are them people that you hang with
Your homeboys are them niggas that you bang with
Your homeboys got your back when you got problems
And your real homeboys will try to help you solve 'em
True homeboys yeah they show patience
They'll help you beat a fools ass in the train station
Ready to stand up against what you facin'
And you got love even though your homeboys be fakin'

[Verse 2: Murs]
Now when you're down for somebody you don't raise when there's trouble
Street beef with the police, you stay down through the struggle
Only down for a few when it comes to me
Cuz most niggas won't even watch your back while you pee
And thats a damn shame
But now I realize the world to some people means different things
Now the way that I was raised, it means through and through
So if your homie ain't down with them fools over there then you get right behind him and scream, "fuck y'all too"
Even if you like the school you got his back just because
And thats what the Netherworlds call homie love
And thats what we call, uh, homie love

(Sample)
Down with a nigga damn near before a nigga was rhyming
My closest homeboy
Down with a nigga damn near before a nigga was rhyming
My closest homeboy
Down with a nigga damn near before a nigga was rhyming
My closest homeboy
Down with a nigga damn near before a nigga was rhyming
My closest homeboy

[Verse 3: Anacron]
What's up M? What's up Murs? What's up Jess? What's up Cop?
Eastside, Krystal, Jedi, Perf, Pro and Pops
Do you got some real niggas?
Well that all depends, on the definition that you use to classify friends
I'm picky with who is selected into my exclusive and elite circle of friends
Every fool I meet ain't going to be the homie
But a gang of marks claim to know me
Only on that shit when they need a name to drop
Those the same motherfuckers that talk shit and spread gossip
Smile like, "whats up"  After the friendships in a coffin
I've seen some niggas do some shit that you would not believe
Like hating on there boy to get a trick up they sleeve
Or a bitch on their arm
That ain't cool at all
So I don't fuck with fools like ?
Dude your homies come first not ass and cash
Them niggas you can hug and be like, "fuck the past"
Them niggas that will blast in the name of retaliation
Them niggas that will last when you break up chains of relations
The family you don't have to share blood with
I'll take my boys to eat before I'm taking out a bitch
And I'd gladly take out their enemies
Theses G'd entities run together in the breeze
Freeze the bullshit and seize the opportunity to appreciate the eight or nine dudes thats true to me

My closest homeboy
Down with a nigga damn near before a nigga was rhyming
