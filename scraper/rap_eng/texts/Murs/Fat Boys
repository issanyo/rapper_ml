[Verse: Anacron]
Fuck what you going through, knowing you
You out there getting jealous cuz my shit is swollen fool
Holding dudes and dudettes captive
Fool deff captions, this vandal gets active
Reactions happen when the hats from a track start cracking
The wood block pops and I rock parts rap bend in two factions
Fresh and better than the rest
Fact is behind the ears most of y'all are wetter than the stretch pants on a trick slit
Embedded in your chest is my response to your request for a battle, vista prints
Your homie hollering peace god can get bend
Cuz I'm one half B-boy and gangster fifty percent
Ill take the time out to serve a B-boy or a graff writer
But ill start punching when marsh mouths are moving but ain't running
Cuz I'm sick of niggas rapping, gums flapping, carrying on
Everybody and they mom got a song thats the bomb
Up, in, here
Yall, suck, its clear
That motherfuckas ain't on sump this year
You gonna bump and steer
When Netherworlds is in the ride
Slashed around in bucketseats with the tweeders up high
I got one reply when guys ask me to rap on the streets
Get the fuck away from me fat fool I make beats

[Hook: Anacron]
Fat boy beats
Fat boy rhymes
Up in the club bust a fat boy time
Fat boys eat like whales in the pond
Fat boys like me strap gats for the crime

[Verse: Murs]
Murs
A fat boy verse, although, long winded
Catch me rhyming in the booth long after my song's ended
I'm giving my fans more like they needed they lines pended
I'm currently grind spending with never a bronze finish
I'm living beyond minutes
Sixty I'm gone with it
Stealing the show, with a hot wired mic
So if it's not sounding hype, then it's not wired right
Before they find the evidence, you know I'm out on a flight
So I can do it again
My crew in the wind
In a room full of groupies asking, "Who want to sin?"
Off the brew and the gin
Don't care who I offend
Cause speaking too much truth got me losing my friends
So I put it in my songs and do it through pens
Combine with beats that make you nod like taking two to the chin
Come up short once before but never losing again
Cause Netherworlds is taking over, me and two of my friends
Bitch

[Hook: Murs]
Fat boy beats
Fat boy rhymes
All up in the club having fat boy times
Fat boy beats
Fat boy rhymes
Buttercup, powder puff, committing fat boy crimes

[Verse: Himself]
Every time I'm on the mic I'm guaranteed to keep the club hoppin'
Like sixfo's with the nose in air and the ass droppin'
And while you passed out from the drinkin' and pill poppin'
I'll be on stage with a fresh Heineken still rockin'
There's always that guy talking about "trying me"
Mad cuz his girl was up front, eyeing me
It ain't my fault that your bitch is a groupie
But you don't have to worry cuz I'm not recruiting
Then there's always them bitches at the back of the bar
Talking loud over your set like they the star
Then there's these groupies don't care who you are
If you rap get the dough, get the pussy, use their car
Then there's the fools down front hatin'
They say I ain't use enough metaphors in what I'm sayin'
Then there's these with their hat cocked, act rough
Saying I don't talk about gats enough
Shut your mouth
Know your role
Netherworlds is in control
Not your average rapper
Talk shit and get stole
But if you listen, it could be good for your soul
Netherworlds is spinnin out of control, grab hold

[Hook: Himself]
Fat boy beats
Fat boy rhymes
All up in the club havin fat boy times
Drinking fat boy Coronas with fat boy limes
Smoking fat boy dimes havin a fat boy time
