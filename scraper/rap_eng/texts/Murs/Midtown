[Verse 1: Murs]
Before Que went away for that bank shit
Before the hipsters moved in on that fake shit
I'm from Midtown without the gang politics
Jefferson to Pico, I represent for all of it
Mexicans and niggas know, I been letting niggas know
Screaming Cloverdale before I let the fuckin trigger go
But I let the trigger go, fuck being a criminal
Still rolling with some shiesty, hustlin' individuals
Bend the law till it almost break
Man y'all always 10 deep, nigga y'all so fake
That's why I don't bring the homies to alot of my shows
Can't be responsible when they start to throwin' blows
Can't stop real niggas from doing what they gotta do
My homies like to trip, talk shit, and wear alot of blue
Nowadays everybody on some different shit
Got the head up out the hood, the future's unlimited

[Bridge: John Givez]
It's on Pico everyday
Where OG stroll memory lane
Y'all niggas try to never just go
When the feets right up at your door

[Chorus: John Givez]
My nigga I'm from midtown
I'm from midtown
Homie I'm from midtown where they love to get down
Homie I'm from midtown
My nigga I'm from midtown
Homie, I'm from midtown where they love to get down
Homie, I'm from midtown, get down

[Verse 2: Murs]
Before Nipsey bought World on Wheels
Back when the little homes on the block had no chill (what up?)
I'm from midtown, roots in that asphalt
One of many roses push they way through them cracks y'all
That's what Pac said, yeah that's what Pac said
Piercing police tried to kill me, I am not dead
Before the grace of God, there go I
That means I could've been any of the homies that died
Guided by the most high, I am so far from worthless
I survive, I am present with a purpose
If only to make you nervous
And challenge status quo, I have done my service
Ay man, ay man, ay man, ay man
When I tell you where I'm from, what you gotta say then
I suggest that you respect my pride
Anything less, the whole set gon' ride

[Bridge: John Givez]
It's on Pico everyday
Where OG stroll memory lane
Y'all niggas try to never just go
When the feets right up at your door

[Chorus: John Givez]
I'm from midtown
Homie I'm from midtown where they love to get down
Homie I'm from midtown
My nigga I'm from midtown
Homie I'm from midtown where they love to get down
Homie I'm from midtown, get down

[Outro: Murs]
Hey look, man I know, that this beat is gangster as fuck
But I'm not, and I never have been
I'm all about peace and love and unity
And this song is about my dream and how
My whole career I just wanted everyone to get along
Man I know everybody from midtown from somewhere different
We don't all get along
But if we don't get it together you all
They about take this whole shit right out from under us
So yall don't gotta fuck with them niggas over there
But don't fuck with them niggas over there
You know what I'm saying?
It's about being at peace with yourself
And once you're at peace with yourself
Then you can be at peace with everybody else
And that doesn't mean we gotta shake hands and hang out and shit
But we gotta stop killing each other
I'm from midtown!
