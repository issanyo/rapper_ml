[Intro]
So, I don't know
Its like, you ever wish you had any amnesia, amnesia?
You know like you could forget whoever it was that ruined it for everyone else?
That one person, if you could just forget them, like you would have a happier life?
Huh, Remember

[Hook]
I keep forgetting to remember to forget
All the lies, and all the bullshit
All the reasons that we had to call it quits
Pieces to our puzzle that never seem to fit
Started out fast and ended so quick
For weeks on end I was so sick
So the next time I start to reminisce
Remind me to remember to forget

[Verse 1: Murs]
Last night I sat down to cry, over you
Then I stopped and asked myself "Why? Over you?"
Then snapped out of it and got on with my day cause
My life been a lot better since the break up
You was only bringing me down
It was nothing but drama when I bring you around
All that attitude, so disrespectful
When I was with you my life was so stressful
Every little thing turned into an argument
We yelling till we don't even remember what started it
I wanted no part of it, I had to move on
Packed my bags headed straight to Tucson
And with you gone, now there's room for
Laughin', smilin' things I need to do more
Lets think about what we could've been
After all you put me through, I'll never be with you again

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Murs]
I quit you, you can't quit me
I was the one that set you free
Oh I see, you got somebody new
Do they know that you can never be true?
That they would never get to know the real you?
'Bout all the scandalous things you like to do?
Do they know you still call me and text me
Run back to me whenever things get messy?
I suggest we continue on our separate path
And quit telling me I'm the best you ever had
I knew that then, I know that now
But once you upgrade you can't go back down

[Hook]

[X3]
Remind me, remind me, remind me
Someone remind me

Remind me, remind me, remind me
Somebody remind me

[Hook]
