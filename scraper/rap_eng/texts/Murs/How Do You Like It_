[Intro: (Sampled)]
More, More, More, how do you like it?

[Verse 1: Himself]
I like my cars fast, women hot and jewelry big
I like my clothes just as loud as my music is
I like to say, "fuck it"
I like my friends thuggish
I like my beats bumpin'
I like my women ruggish
The type of woman to say, "fuck you"
Type of girl don't trust a motherfucker but you
Half the time she don't even trust you
But will be the first one to stand up if a fool rush you
We like to get blown and ride out
Hit the front of the club and slide out
Spend it all by the end of the night, pockets inside out
Time to do what you like, until we head back to the hide out
(You ready to go?)
For the grand finale, ever since the first day we met you had to have me
And since then I've been wanting you badly
And we no longer have to fight it
Just tell me how you like it

(Refrain)
(More, More, More, how do you like it?How do you like it?)
Do you like it when I do it like that?
(More, More, More, how do you like it?How do you like it?)
Do you like it when I hit it from the back?
(More, More, More, how do you like it?How do you like it?)
Do you like it when I touch it like that?
(More, More, More, how do you like it? How do you like it?)

[Verse 2: Himself]
I like my nights long
When I drink, I like it strong (rum straight)
Everybody like a thong, if it disappears right (look at her)
I love it when you shake it all night
Strip for me privately, thats what I like (shit stop playing girl)
I like it how your hips groove
On a secret garden rendezvous
Just me and you, girl
You know I like the way your lips move
When they whisper the things they do
That gets me deeper into you
Uh, I like it how you push back
Ask me to push your hood back and I understood that
(I can do that)
I like it when you reach up and grab onto me
I like it when your freaky side is shown to me
Tonight? shit, just tell me how you like it
You, you don't have to fight it
You can whisper in my ear what gets you excited
All you have to do is tell me how you like it

(Refrain)

[Verse 3 :Himself]
See, we like our cars big, we like our women fast
We like to walk slow, we like the greenest grass
We like classic chevy's, we like our pinky rings heavy
Always on that mission to get our money steady
We like our women sexy, 'specially if they do it right
We stay up all day and all crush all night
Even when it ain't we like to say everything is alright, even if we not
We like losing ourselves in music so we love it when the beat Knock
We like talking shit to the beat cop, that likes talking shit to us every time we stop
We like laughing off to under covers looking for the weed spot We like sending em off (yeah,yeah, its that way)
We like getting money at any cost
But most of us will never be rich
Better enjoy life how it is while you still got one to live

(Refrain)

[Verse 4: Himself]
We like buying shit, trying to get gratitude
We like women with a little bit of attitude
We like the beats twangin' riding up the avenue
All of us hangin' out the windows as we travel through
Fix the beats first cuz thats our choice
Just equalize the shit so we can hear the voice
We act like we ain't go no sense
Pull them dents, get a paint job before you by them rims
But we like frontin'
Huntin' stunts and big bluntin'
Slumber beneath the wheel till we can't see the street
Trying to reach 1-15 with a B in the hand and your woman with a drink in the passenger seat
Switching lanes so fast bit down the teat
But its all good cuz she's turned on by speed
Touch me softly as we drive, she turned on by me
I like it when she makes that fire burn inside of me
Shit, all you gotta do is tell me how you like it
You, you don't have to fight it
You can whisper in my ear what gets you excited
All you have to do is tell me how you like it
