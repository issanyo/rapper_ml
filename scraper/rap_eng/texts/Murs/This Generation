[Verse 1 - Fashawn]
I came out the gate, 1988
Pops was out to skate
Momma said she was late
Still Even with his absence I had to adjust
With the madness grew up
A little quicker than your average
Cause limitations I ain't had none
A young black kid
Brainwashed by rap and rock
VCRs, I had the Magnavox
Back in high school, we had the campus locked
Non grad, didn't have to drop out but
We needed something to believe in
When we were living for the weekend
Teacher said we wouldn't be shit
Not bad for some heathens

[Hook]
Thanks for the lack of faith
In judging what I do
This generation
Ain't nothing I can say
What can I tell to you
This generation

[Verse 2: MURS & Fashawn]
They say we ain't playing with a full deck
They let us down, why they upset
[Fashawn]
Nothing but the naked truth, I feel undressed
21 gun salute for young vets
[MURS]
Rodney King did what he had to
Now these white girls get to date black dudes
[Fashawn]
Shorty's into rosaries and rap feuds
Young niggas with snapbacks and tattoos
[MURS]
We fast food, sell a lot of kush
If you rap dude, getting hella push
[Fashawn]
Missed the Reagan era, but we got Bush
Talking 'bout the same spot that Barack took
[MURS]
My generation on some other shit
Getting faded while we waiting on the mothership
[Fashawn]
And not dependent on the government
To teach this generation how to love again

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We used to read guns and ammo
Crack cocaine left the hood in shambles
On the streets of Lynwood
Gang bang insane, the gang was in hood
Piru, crip
Don't ever let your Jheri curl drip
When the winters don't end
When the homie's big brother just shot his best friend
Hit him right through the chest
At the school, at the crib, playing Russian roulette
And you wonder why we do what we do for the set
Any given moment homie, you could be next
It's what we do for respect
Cause this generation got a noose on its neck
We let it all hang out
Society wouldn't let us in so we banged out
