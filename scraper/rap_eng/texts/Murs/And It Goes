[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Yeah, the ambition of a young nigga
The transition of a drug dealer
Under surveillance, always somebody watching
Stop clocking my moose, you leave me no option
Unmask this lames, look 'em dead in their eyes
I reckon you recognize I'm forever fly
Something gotta give, cause I'm dying inside
I don't know how to live, I pray to the sky
I'm seeking a blessing, I'm seeking direction
I'm lost in the reefer, knee deep in depression
And your problems are meager, not even an issue
Everyday is a dilemma, I'm in need of a pistol
Loyalty is my demise, feel a G 'till I die
Take this shit to the grave, and it ain't my homocide
Look at what I became, who the fuck is the blame?
Fell out of love for fame, I'm just stuck in the game

[Hook]
And it goes, and it goes, and it goes
And it goes, and it goes, and it goes
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
And it goes, and it goes, and it goes
And it goes, and it goes, and it goes
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

[Verse 2: Murs]
We on Peak Boulevard, just a little north
Gloverdale, we out there everyday up on that porch
Haze smoking back and forth, pay in and out of court
Me I was just rapping having dreams of a super sport
'96 Chevy, shit started getting heavy
First they pop off, then we pop off, but I just wasn't ready
So hold that banger so I had to make a change of pace
Still in danger cause the other side they know my face
Detention hard to swallow, feel like I'm getting followed
Only nigga from the block with that white Eldorado
Paranoid as fuck, feeling like they out to get me
.45 in the truck, my God, God is with me
I'm riding down the city, intentions for the worst
Cause I be damned if I slip up and let them get me first
I do my dirt all by my lonely, not from any hood
I pop the truck, I cock it back, we about to see what's really good

[Hook]
