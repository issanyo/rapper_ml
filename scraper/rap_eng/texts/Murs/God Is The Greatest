Verse 1:
805's and skate highs
Praise to the most high
Hater's hate in high key
So I say in low-fi
Low-fi, meaning that i'm dirty like Blowfly
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my God, look at these frauds
Claiming that they goons
And that they do it for the squad
Fingers on triggers that never go bang
Gang gang gang gang
Gang gang gang gang
Faking like they felons
But they do it for the fame
Ain't no Crips in Calabasas where they tell you that they hang
Say from a hood but got no turf to claim
Liar liar, watch they pants burst into flames
Aiming at the stars, false prophets and celebreties
Chop em all down with my murderous melodies
Say they run the city but they know they can't fade us
Really with the bullshit, but I stayed prayed up

Chorus:
Dear Lord
(I can't be faded)
Please deliver from me from
(Y'all Niggas hating)
All who would wish me ill
(Fuck y'all I made it)
You are my sword and shield
(God is the greatest)
Dear Lord
(I can't be faded)
Please deliver from me from
(Y'all Niggas hating)
All who would wish me ill
(Fuck y'all I made it)
You are my sword and shield
(God is the greatest)

Verse 2:
Shhhhh, careful cuz the feds watch
Crazy when my meds stop
Mind racing like Satan's got me in a head lock
Meet me in that moment and I might
Lick off your head top
Dreadlocks, Dreadlocks, Dreadlocks, Dreadlocks
Dreadlocks falling down
Can't nobody calm me down
Used to be hype shit
Lit is what they call it now
Conscious was underground
Guess we had a turn around
Burn it down, burn it down, burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down Babylon
Running is decathalon
Paying never show they work
So I know the math is wrong
Faith without that shit
Ape shit, bat shit
Champion champion, y'all talking practice
Pastor is a catfish
A bullshitting baptist
Riding in his Bently, a banger with a back fist
Backsliding slackness, tyrannical tactics
Pray over the body then I fade em into blackness

Chorus:
Dear Lord
(I can't be faded)
Please deliver from me from
(Y'all Niggas hating)
All who would wish me ill
(Fuck y'all I made it)
You are my sword and shield
(God is the greatest)
Dear Lord
(I can't be faded)
Please deliver from me from
(Y'all Noggas hating)
All who would wish me ill
(Fuck y'all I made it)
You are my sword and shield
(God is the greatest)

Verse 3:


Chorus:
Dear Lord
Please deliver from me from
All who would wish me ill
You are my sword and shield
Dear Lord
Please deliver from me from
All who would wish me ill
You are my sword and shield
