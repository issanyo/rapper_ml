[Verse 1: Underbosses]
Underboss, take a trip to where you can't see
And control the scenes with the puppet strings invisible
I seen dreams shattering the shars
Laid a trick that could part where the hearts are all edibals
I press hard, fall into the trap doors
Really wasn't asking for more than exceptance
In the presence of exception over collective human beings
Being talented is simply not enough, you gotta mean it
Since I want this, it feels like it chose me
I owe it to myself to keep pressing on (pressing on)
Stressing on the piddle why the riddle was constructed
Down the hustle like a '79
And you was dancin' up on good times (good times)
A pocket full of good rhymes
To help you through the hard moments of your life (your life)

[Hook]
It's just the way that I write (write)
After all whats most important if its something I like (I like)
It's just the way that we write (write)
After all whats most important if its something we like (we like)
It's just the way that we write (write)
After all whats most important if its something we like (we like)
It's just the way that we write (write)
After all whats most important if it's something you like (you like)
It's just the way that we write (write)
After all it's most important

[Verse 2: Murs]
Man I love hip hop some say I take it too serious
But rappers being fake always makes me so furious, mysteriously mad
They say I need a shrink but I think I'mma stick to my pen and my pad
My only therapist - my life and I'm sharing it with ya'll
Hoping they can stop you from tearing down them walls cos I'm going through it too
Expose it in our tracks and I'm showing it to you
So we can break it down and benefit, analyse the blemishes
Skip the cigarettes cos that nicoteens a stimulate
It don't calm you down
And alcohols a lion
At the bottom of the bottles where your problems always found
If I'm sober then I'm down in a slump, batting zero
Melencholy mother fucker not too happy or too cheerful
Sessions of depression got me stressing something awful
My family and friends and that smile said its soulful
But it really don't help, the enemies in the mirror
And I can't face myself, I pray for help
But these drugs ain't working, I just don't know shit
Thats the only thing thats certain
Feel like I'm about to die when my chest starts hurtin'
And I'm thinking that its hurtin'
Cause the Zanics they prescribe don't help control my vibe
I'mma live hip hop 'til the day that I die
Cause making good music's all that keeps me alive uh
