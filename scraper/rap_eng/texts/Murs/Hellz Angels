[Whispered]
Back in black

Intro [MURS]
What up fool? Aye, you know I'm over here
You write, you writin' like Scarub over here, takin' hella light years. Ha ha

Chorus: [x2]
[Sunspot Jonz] It's like a one two shot
[MURS] Underground hip hop
[Sunspot Jonz] Blaze up, feel it pop
[MURS] Living Legends don't stop like aaaayyyyyeee

Verse One [MURS]
I'm in the body shop about twelve o'clock
Middle of the day, I was feelin' kinda hot
Throw out a couple tips while I sit and watch
Then I got some lap dances, $40 a pop

[Sunspot Jonz]
Yeah, I'm doin' body shots
Seein' what this hottie got
Tequila on my brain now you see another body drop
Sunspot baby
Never gonna stop
MURS you look broke as hell from the bottom to the top

[MURS]
At the bottom where we used to eat cheese food spread
Now I'm makin' cheese gettin' taxed by the Feds
Ahead (A head) of the game in this body of rap
Fuck around with Sunspot and you might get slapped

[Sunspot]
That goes on and on and on and on
All up in your body til the walls are worn
It's like sandpaper
Naw, it's like paper chaser
Til they get a sack like a motherfuckin' Oakland Raider

Chorus

Verse Two [MURS]
Takin' out the head of a Report group
Tell 'em Nick will have to go I'm the new recruit
Yeah, I"m talkin' bout the O.C
On a Thursday night, where your ass gon' be?
I'm gonna have my body sittin' on my couch
Next to the hot body of my future spouse
I'm addicted to the drama
Runnin' all through my body, no sign of a comma
Huuuuuh
Yeah
Still I pause for a breath
Tell your home girl to pick up the drawers if she left
On the floor by my bed that I peeled off her body
Can't help, I'm in love with the feel of her body
Them hips, them lips
On the real she a hottie
If she ever want to hook up or chill
Tell her to call me
And we can hang tough like Summer and Seth
Just got to hook me up with what's under that dress, yes

Chorus

Verse Three [Sunspot Jonz]
That's right big bank take little bank
That's a one two punch comin' from a top rank
To the evil saint
Bloody like it body paint
Mad as Mike Tyson when the alimony gettin' paid
Mad as O.J
Mad as his bitches maine
Mad as gettin' cash, shit is too expensive man
Mad as Jennifer when Angelina fuckin' Brad
She should have body blowed, red carpet, Oscar, damn
You got to let it go
Blastin' all hysterical
Let a motherfucker know
Let a motherfucker know
I'm an animal
Predator to radio
Jocks gettin' knocked off
Any other corny ho
Not givin' love straight to my crew
We changed the whole game and we even changed you
Up, down, all around in your body
It's just a body high
Right enhanced by Barcardi
I got you fake ass rappers all shook
I don't care who you are
From the Feds, get your ass whooped
And take your groupie
Naked but my CD
Invasion Of The Body Snatchers when I'm in your cit-y

That's right [x25]

"I do this for a living!"

Chorus
