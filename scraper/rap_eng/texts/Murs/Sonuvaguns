[Verse: Himself]
I step into the club with the same shit I've been rocking all day
Laughing at the hoes lying about being on the list and watching them all pay
My homie tried to holler but she didn't stop for him
Didn't know we were performing and he could have got them in
Hit the bar before the show
I'm trying to get scummy
Strobe light honeys
In the light they be looking funny
I ain't no dummy
The first thing I say is I ain't got no money
Can you buy me a drink on the rocks?
I like it when the ice cubes go clink
Yeah, okay, wonderful, hey look, I don't care what you think
You're gonna drive me crazy, I'm already on the brink
Plus its been five minutes and you ain't bought that drink
With the krimp in her hair and light in her eyes
You could see she didn't get a lot of guys, and I sympathies
But I'm trying to get drunk before I get on stage
And I'll give her a shoutout while I'm up there just to make her day

[Hook: Murs]
We just some loveable, hugable, fuckable son of a guns
Looking for some loveable, hugable, fuckable ones
We just some loveable, hugable, fuckable son of a guns
Looking for some loveable, hugable, fuckable ones
We just some loveable, hugable, fuckable son of a guns
Looking for some loveable, hugable, fuckable ones
We just some loveable, hugable, fuckable son of a guns
Looking for some loveable, hugable, fuckable ones

[Verse: Murs]
I strolled into the place with ? on the rocks
Looking for a ? with some nice ?
I'm off the block, I'm off the chain, I'm out my mind
Stagger to the bar when I'm feeling just fine
Didn't have to wait in line, cuz my names on the list
This girl asked me where I'm from, I said "a satellite bitch
I'm just that fly"
She just rolled her eyes
And then she grabbed my hand
And led me to the dance
So I stepped to the floor with my Circa's and I worked her
She let me grab her waist
Put her fingers in her panties, pulled it out gave me a taste
I knew she was a freak, no time to waste
We quickly left the place
From my ralpha to the casa
Thats where I beat it up like she was talking hella masa
Said thank you for the time, dropped her off playing 18 with a bullet
Thats how we do it, graffiti rock, don't bullshit

[Verse: Anacron]
It's a party up in here
With Netherworlds with plenty bros and pretty hoes (work that leather girl)
Liquor lays the foundation for creating love stories
That end in heartbreak, you be Bess I'll be Porgy
We finna have an orgy
If my woman calls, Imma stall, cuz I don't want her to smell no bitches on my balls
The rap sayers, breakers, players ball, Damn ya'll it's hot as hell
Yeah my niggas out of jail, so we all about to bail
Niggas smoking pot as well, getting fucked up
I got two video glamor hoes that's stuck up
Light skinned with curly hair cradled under each arm
"Damn Cron them hoes is the bomb"
Yeah what can i say, whats up Dub-L?
"You want a beer?"
No, I'm sober as always, dank and drank don't permeate my body's hallways
"I'm finna mash out"
I got a nut I gotta be busting soon
So imma leave you with this track thats just in tune
