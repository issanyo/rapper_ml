[Intro: Murs]
What up though?
This is Murs
Shout out to Guts
Shout out to Cody Chesnutt
Peace and love

[Verse 1: Murs]
Three- sixteen- one- nine- seven- eight
The day a angel was cast right outta heavens gate
Into this world full of sane and hate
Into the arms of a woman with an insufficient mate
Mom suffered through the first half of her life
With a few different men, it was all mad trife
That made me angry, so I would fight
Light-weight frame with a  knuckle game nice
Now I'm tryna save every woman I meet
Cause I couldn't stop the woman I love from being beat
Can't learn to be a man now, running the streets
Hard to teach yourself hate, in the fear of police
So I got into my music found love and peace
Some knowledge of myself in a set of beliefs
These days I'm making millions paying taxes doing good
But to you, I'm just another black kid from the hood

[Hook: Cody Chesnutt]
I don't wanna be
That kind of disappointment
That kind of destruction
That kind of heartless
I just wanna be
A light that could bring
A cold heart to life, so I

[Bridge 1: Cody Chesnutt & Murs]
Peace brother Murs
This track has been finding the spirit
It's my prayer that, all the universe could hear
And brother Cody I pray
This track here be a blessing to all who hear it
And all who chose to receive it
In the name of the creator, amen

[Bridge 2: Cody Chesnutt]
Murs, Murs the question I'm dealing with
Give it to you like I'm feeling it
Touching a art of the streets
With all the possibilities

[Verse 2: Murs]
And if you listen real close than I pray that you change
A quote once told me some of these people are strange
For maintain, stay in your lane
Be a victor not a victim if you gotta play the game
Know your aim, remain focused
Don't be too concerned with who's the richest or the brokest
Take notice, true others are the spirit
The keys of the kingdom will be carried by the fearless
I hope you hear this, material possessions
Are cool for you to have till they become obsessions
Once the things you have, have a hold on you
You're nothing more than a slave being told what to do

[Hook: Cody Chesnutt]
I don't wanna be
That kind of disappointment
That kind of destruction
That kind of heartless
I just wanna be
A light that could bring
A cold heart to life, so I

[Outro: Murs]
And I like to thank Guts
For making a dream come true
Working with the honorable Cody Chesnutt
Peace and love
