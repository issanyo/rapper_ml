[Intro]
I wanna say this about Murs too
I think he's a superhero because he's doing something that hasn't been done either, you know?
I know when I came up and started doing the music
Maybe I didn't have the courage that Murs had to say, "You know what, this isn't right"
You know, uh, kids and family making the right decisions
The way he that he does his music he's telling you the artist truth

[Verse]
Close the door and give us a moment
I'd like to scrub the floor with all of my opponents
Tell it how it is take it how you want it
Sound a little different in that radio rap don't it?
'Cause this is what it sound like
When real motherfuckers get around mics
21 Savage with the rhyme
You started out on YouTube, dabbin' for the vine
Slow-mo dancin' on that pop shit
Like Coco better beware of that drop kick
That Vocal will make the air wave toxic
Spittin' so local man these suckers can't stop it
Since before local, then I hop in the cock pit
In Kamizaze, that's how you suppose to hit the block bitch
Modern day, ghetto profit
How could I not be?
I was raised on that Pac shit
Like a Go-pro, yeah homie watch this
Used to be local now I'm dancin' on top bitch
20 years deep, hoe grab your galoshes
Since Project Blowed I've been so obnoxious
We were screamin' on them whack niggas
Can't you see I'm excresing demons, get back nigga
I ain't been right in a long time
Shout out to Mitchy Slick and the Wrongkind
From Dago to the Bay niggas know me
Used to be Greyhound bound now I'm OG
One call will get a rap nigga lit up
Call to golden state y'all need to fuck with us
Killas, hustlers, pimps, weirdos
Call 'em criminals but those is my heroes
When Eazy-E signed Will.i.Am
You want a picture of that moment? Nigga, here I am
When Cypress Hill made Killa Man
I had just started writin' in, I was still a fan
Made my first my song at Mike Caren house
Back when my mama used to worry 'bout my whereabouts
Catch a grown nigga in a cypher I would air 'em out
Curfews and college what I did not care about
I was off on my own
Captain of my own ship tryin' be grown
For a Captain to save a hoe and it was on
Before he had the formula I started making songs
Going on 2 minutes and I'm still flowing
This nigga, oh gosh, got the horns blowing
And it sounds so triumpant
I came up in the 90's I ain't never for that punk shit
Four 15's in the trunk shit
Get the function jumpin', bumpin' enough for the funk bitch
Or should I say "bitch"?
'Cause Todd Shaw taught us all how to get rich
And Snoop Dogg is a real Crip
The truest Piru I met was my nigga Quick
Who me? I'm only Nick
But I'm 'bout to rap my ass off on this shit
I'm from West L.A, Mid City y'all
But the culture came from New York City, dawg
Made me a superhero in so many ways
Now I'm flying all around the world and I'm gettin' paid
And any day know this shit could end
All you got is your faith, and your family, and your friends
Let us begin
Peace
