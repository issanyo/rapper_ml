Omar
Uno
You sound so beautiful

Okay, I'm driving a(lone)
Not a care in the (world)
Got my music up (loud)
And I'm staring at (girls)
And I'm off in my (zone)
I ain't feeling no (stress)
I'm ignoring your (calls)
Just send me a (text)
Roll down the win(dow)
Let the wind blow my (dreads)
I'm as real as they (come)
I'm a straight thorough(bred)
And I'm driving so (slow)
I got nowhere to (go)
Cash in my back pocket, I'm sittin on dough! (Yeah)
Swag is (official)
I is who I (am)
I don't need yo (opinion)
I know I'm the (man)
I'm a champ like (Ali)
And a king like (T.I.)
Yeah, the time match my jeans, 501 like Levi
Tires got (air)
And my tank is on (F)
I might ride till they (faint)
Got to interstate (left)
And I'm plottin' a (?)
Einstein couldn't figure
Starin' at the world through my rearview mirror, I'm

(Ridin' all by myself) Just thinkin'
(Rindin' all by myself) Just coolin'

I stop at green lights
I go at red lights
I flow in black tees
I smile wit' all whites
I'm makin big moves
I'm cool as igloos
I'm strong as ten dudes
I'm sharp as ginsu
(Yeah) That's me drivin'
(Naw) No shofer
(Yeah) I'm lookin' at ya
(Yeah) You made me swerve
(Yeah) The sun shinin'
(Yeah) The sky's blue
(Yeah) I've been grindin'
(Naw) That's nothin' new
(Yeah) I rap alot, music stay around me
Got bars everywhere, just like burger street
And oh yeah, Marv told me go head switch the style up
If they hate then let em hate and watch the money pile up
My natural high is ridin by myself
And I'm always strapped, cause I rock my seatbelt
I got this, I ain't need no help
It's always all good when I'm ridin', by myself

(Ridin' all by myself) Just thinkin'

(Murs)
Yeah
Just left the interstate, a couple minutes late
Light skin chick I'm suppose to meet for a dinner date
But look she can wait, I'm feelin' me time
Police roll by, I threw the peace sign
I'm feelin' that good, no worries bro
The light turn green, I don't hurry though
Just got the car washed, I'm feelin' top notch
Mind simmerin' with schemes like a crock pot
And I speed up, my mind slows down
I'm hittin' every light, feelin' like I own the town
I need a (???), feel like I'm on parade
Feel like I'm stittin' on them things and you on roller blades
It's just a prius though, (???)
My dashboard light up, like a spaceship
Back to the future, without the flux capacitor
I'm in my own zone, I ain't pickin' up no passangers

(Ridin' all by myself) Just thinkin'
(Rindin' all by myself) Just coolin'
(Ridin' all by myself) Just thinkin'
(Rindin' all by myself) Just coolin'
(Ridin' all by myself) Just thinkin'

Don't ask for a ride when I'm ridin' by myself (Why?)
Cause I'll pass you by when I'm ridin' by myself (uh)
Caus I'm clearin' my mind when I'm ridin' by myself
I'm havin' me-time when I'm ridin' by myself (Hey!)
