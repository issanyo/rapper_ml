[Verse 1: Murs]
What if I could ice down all of my tears
Would my face be covered in diamonds from ear to ear?
Would real niggas respect me then?
Will some of these white girls wanna be more than my friend?
If I could take all of my tears and cry them into a chain
I wonder how many million more followers I'd gain
I bet my socials would be super lit
It wouldn't even matter what type of vocals that I have to spit
I could turn all this salty water that fell from my eyes into some diamond karats
Then when I cry in public I could finally do so without having someone tell me I should feel embarrassed
'Cause I'm not and I cried a whole lot
When I filed a divorce and when the homie got shot
And not one time did I laugh at Tyrese's tears
'Cause when I was separated from my son I cried every day for almost a year
And at near the end of that year span I was filled with joy
'Cause my new fiance and I were expecting a baby boy
But after 40 weeks he was born without a heartbeat
Still we chose to march forward instead of retreat

[Chorus: Murs]
I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it seemed impossible to take the next step
I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it felt like God had his foot on my chest
I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it felt like I couldn't take another breath
I put one foot in front of the next
'Cause life is just a battle in the shadow of death

[Verse 2: Murs]
We bury Pooh, and the very same day
They called us said they wanna take my baby away
I beat the case but I didn't beat the odds
I got so many questions when I finally meet God
"Like why you make it so hard? Why you even let me try?
Why my marriage couldn't work? Why you let my baby die?"
I apologize or not, you about to hear a lot
This is not really music, it's me dealing with my thoughts
It was breathe trauma (huh), breathe trauma (huh), breathe trauma (huh), breathe
It's hard to kill the drama when the trauma won't leave
So if karma does exist I find it hard to believe
'Cause if you reap what you sow, I didn't sow these seeds
I need a Grammy for the damage, platinum plaque as a bandage
A couple healthy kids before I start to understand it
But because the fans demand it and the label said I should
I put it all into these songs and the hopes its understood

[Chorus: Murs]
I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it seemed impossible to take the next step
I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it felt like God had his foot on my chest
I put one foot in front of the next
Even when it felt like I couldn't take another breath
I put one foot in front of the next
'Cause life is just a battle in the shadow of death

[Outro: Robots&Balloons]
I've been crawling up the side of a mountain
Problems, they got me falling back down
Know this, all the flames I'll put em down
And know I'ma climb out
I've been crawling up the side of a mountain
Problems, they got me falling back down
Know this, all the flames ill put em down
And know I'ma climb out
