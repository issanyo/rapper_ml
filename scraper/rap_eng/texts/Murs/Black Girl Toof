[Verse 1: Murs]
Product of a unplanned parenthood
Most folks said the you was damaged goods
Wouldn't change a damn thing if I could
If I could share in your pain, I would
Pops was a G', he ran the whole strip
He was smoked out by nineteen eighty six
Then he fucked around and went to the pen
That's when your momma got a boyfriend
He'd be standing by your bed whenever you woke up
She said you were the reason that they broke up
She kept bringing home all these lame dudes
When it didn't work out she would blame you
Divorced the next guy since he was a cheater
Your pops got out, he never came to see you
Every man that you love always seems to leave you
So you don't think that I'mma to stick around either

If I could turn back the clock
I'd get your pops to stop smoking rocks

[Hook: Murs]
And maybe then I'd have a shot
Since your past got your future on lock
I know you been through a lot
I wish I could make the pain stop
I wish you love the man that you got
Instead you love the man that I'm not

[Verse 2: Murs]
Your first boyfriend was a piece of shit
Took you three years for you to leave the prick
Finally caught him cheating, so you had to split
He tried to keep in touch, you wasn't having it
We was best friends all the way through high school
'til I finally figured out you was the right move
I stepped up when he stepped down
You wanted something different for the next round
I was underground; a weirdo [?]
But I knew how to treat a woman with respect
I showed you the meaning of true passion
I gave you your first orgasm
He would get on top and just pound on you
He never even went down on you
Well I kiss you head to foot
Busting stupid dope moves, and I had you hooked

I wish I could turn back the clock
Teach your ex to find your g-spot

[Hook]
