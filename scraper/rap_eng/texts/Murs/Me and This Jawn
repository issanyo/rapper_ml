[Hook]
Me and this Jawn gotta thing goin' on
So many years it's been goin' so strong
Never did I think that we would make it this long
But it feels so right that it can't be wrong
Now we all grown, made a house to a home
Still get that feelin' when I call you on the phone
All we been through, I can't leave you alone
Said, it feels so right that it can't be wrong

[Verse 1]
I met you on valentine's through a pal of mine
I knew he liked you but he was outta line
I was nerdy actin', yeah, I was dirty mackin'
Said my piece then waited on your reaction
You said yes, I guess out of pity
Had me hella happy, I was skip around my city
She really likes me, I call right away
You waited 50 hours, I counted night and day
Once we talked I knew you were different
I had my work cut out for me from the beginning
I played Luther, all types of lullabies
I wrote you crazy poetry, competing with them other guys
I made you mix tapes, I wanted the exclusive
Playin' hard to get, so elusive
It wasn't love at first sight but I made you love me
Know you couldn't be happier that you gave it to me

All we been through, I can't leave you alone

[Verse 2]
I must have my females crossed
Cause if you ain't the one then, baby, I'm lost
Picked you up and cut the other girls off
Now it's me and you against the world at any cost
I said I must have my females crossed
Cause if you ain't the one then, baby, I'm lost
Picked you up and cut the other girls off
Now it's me and you against the world at any cost
I walked on the wild side for ya
The boys on the block used to chase you round the corna
Claimin' some gang, I didn't care which
They was just mad, you wasn't they chick
We had a lotta, we had a few fights
But it was all done at the end of every night
We hit the boardwalk under the pier
Underneath full moons I would whisper in your ear
You're my sweetheart, girl, you're my everything
Worked two jobs just to get you this wedding ring
I haven't gave it to ya, I'm tryin' to save till ya
Least expect it and make it something major for ya
You're the best thing to happen in my life
Now it's time for you to get it crackin' as my wife
Beauty and brains, the package so right
Plus it don't hurt, you give me action every night
