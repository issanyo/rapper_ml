[Chorus] [Sharp Skills] (Murs):
(Aye Skills)
What up?
(I got somethin' to say
Radio needs somethin' to play
Weeeeell
Give 'em a demo and a pillow and limo
Then maybe we'll be on our way
Ayo Murs
(What up?)
I got somethin' to say
Radio needs somethin' to play
(Weeeeell
Give 'em a demo and a pillow and limo
Then maybe we'll be on our way)

[Murs]:
Now I've been dope since Nancy Regan was against it
Ever since then I never lowered my defenses
My offense is senseless
I'm stupid fresh
How'd I get this dope? Only you can guess
Well um...
Yeah, I'm blessed a lil' somethin'
But talent's only 10% of what it takes to run this
It takes sacrifice, determination, discipline
But what it all mean if nobody's listenin'?
Radio...
Suckas never play me
On the mic, they say I'm crazy
Cause I don't walk around with my Glock out
You can have a full clip and still get knocked out
So I block out the games on a rebound
'Bout to be a change in everything you see now
A revolution
To what you hear
An invisible solution to make myself clear

[Chorus] [Sharp Skills] (Murs):
(Aye Skills)
What up?
(I got somethin' to say
Radio need somethin' to play
Weeeeell
Give 'em a demo and a pillow and limo
Then maybe we'll be on our way
Ayo Murs
(What up?)
I got somethin' to say
Radio need somethin' to play
(Weeeeell
Give 'em a demo and a pillow and limo
Then maybe we'll be on our way)
