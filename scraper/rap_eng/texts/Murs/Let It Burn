[Verse 1]
I'm a super soula
Stayin' present 'till the movie over
If I could do it all over I would do it sober
Maybe not
Maybe so
Ate a couple shrooms never made it to the blow
But I sold a lot of dro
Started with some stress then invested in the grow
Need money, see money
Built a music empire with a little weed money
Kirby that's my main man
Started out of Stockton California with the same plan
God married he a changed man
Lotta new friends but I still got the same fans
They say damn that's amazing bro
Flip the blood money now the currency is crypto
Shout out to equipto
Fuck Ann Lee let my nigga run frisko

[Hook]
Fuck the paper
Fuck the paper
Let it burn
You make mistake after mistake and then you learn
That the money don't make the world turn
And I put that on my Momma they ain't takin' what I earned
Fuck the paper
Fuck the paper
Let it burn
You make mistake after mistake and then you learn
Let it burn
That the money don't make the world turn
And I put that on my life they ain't takin' what I earned

So tell the government to suck my dick
Counted votes but they don't mean shit
I hope this motherfucker get his throat slit
Hit a pain in my heart when i wrote this shit
So tell the government to suck my dick
Counted votes but they don't mean shit
I hope this motherfucker get his throat slit
Had tears in my eyes when I wrote this shit

[Verse 2]
I'm a super soldier
Keep it moving 'til the movement's over
Keep a toolie for the rollers that's what Huey showed us
It all used to be legal
That's until we started packin' they was scared of my people
(Power to the people)
Well armed and well trained
The power of a bullet
The power of your brain
(Let it bang)
Educated street music vibes
There really ain't no difference between you and I
They separate us by skin color
So we don't unite and get to fightin' with Big Brother
The all seeing eye
Glued to our phones now we all seein' lies
I say it's time we all rise
We about to change the world soon as this generation dies
So let the truth set you free
Then set fire to the system 'cause it wasn't meant to be

[Hook]
Fuck the paper
Fuck the paper
Let it burn
You make mistake after mistake and then you learn
That the money don't make the world turn
And I put that on my Momma they ain't takin' what I earned
Fuck the paper
Fuck the paper
Let it burn
You make mistake after mistake and then you learn
Let it burn
That the money don't make the world turn
And I put that on my life they ain't takin' what I earned

So tell the government to suck my dick
Counting votes but they don't mean shit
I hope this motherfucker get his throat slit
Hit a pain in my heart when i wrote this shit
So tell the government to suck my dick
Counting votes but they don't mean shit
I hope this motherfucker get his throat slit
Had tears in my eyes when I wrote this shit
