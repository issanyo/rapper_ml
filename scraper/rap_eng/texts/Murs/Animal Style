[Verse 1]
Fresh out of high school, glad cause he hated it
Everybody in the senior class'll call him gay but it
It never bothered him, his name Johnathan
Best friend Julie, she was cool, she went to prom with him
The principal said prom was no place for a queer couple
If he showed up with a boy then it'd be real trouble
Empty threats, but what really got to him
Is that his boyfriend didn't wanna go to prom with him
Boyfriend Roderick, kept the secret closeted
Scared to come out into this world of zero tolerance
Kinda popular, played a lot of politics
Johnathan was book smart, just received a scholarship
Off to college, wanted Roderick to follow him
He see him in the halls but Rod would never acknowledge him
Away from school though, he was so affectionate
John had a good thing, no use in upsetting it
Besides in college everything would be different
Everyone is educated, no one would be tripping, huh
He had it all figured out
Plus his parents were excited just to get him out the house
So they bought him a ticket, even bought one for Roderick
Said to leave the end of summer, they would pay for all of it
So excited on his way to work at In-N-Out
End of his shift, he drove straight up to Roderick's house
He hopped out, saw him with his crew
He walked right up, he was ready to share the news
It had been a few days, he forgot how much he missed him
So excited that he moved in and kissed him
Roderick dissed him, threw him to the floor
He said, "you faggot! What'd you have to do that for?"
Looked at his homies, "You know I'm not gay"
They just shook their heads, turned and walked away
("Fuck. Fuck's wrong with you?")
Now he's screaming at Johnathan, what the hell was wrong with him
John said, "Okay, it's over? Let's be honest then
They never knew the real you, they not your real friends"
He drove away and vowed to never speak to him again
It had been a few weeks
Before John left for college, he thought that they should speak
Scared to do it, for fear of rejection
But either way, he knew the world would never accept him

[Interlude]
(Dear America, when you tell gay Americans that they can't serve their country openly or marry the person that they love, you're telling that to kids too.)

[Verse 2]
Roderick was seventeen, in and out of jail since ten
Never knew his father or spent time with any other men
He started running in them circles with the hustlers
Gangbanging, dope slanging, had some loyal customers
Locked him up at a very young age
Found religion and it ended all his criminal ways
He also found his first boyfriend when he was locked up
Came home conflicted so he really didn't talk much
Felt beginnings of a double life
The chaplain back in juve used to tell him that it wasn't right
His bond with God was so strong
That was until he met John
And it felt so perfect
But suffering eternal damnation, was it worth it?
He still had to see him
It had been two years, he knew that he could never leave him

So he lived in fear of God's wrath
The preacher said God loves us all except fags
And that made him so mad he started packing his bags
Said he'd run away with John until it went all bad

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
The big incident
John slipped in front of his friends and started kissing him
Now everything was different
He shut him out, never thought about forgiving him
Until he got that text
John wanted to meet up the day after next
They met at In-N-Out, on his dinner break
But he was so mad that he couldn't look him in the face
Soon as he spoke, they both started crying
Said he missed him so much, he felt like he was dying
John said, "I can't describe how much I missed you"
That's when Roderick pulled his pistol
He shot him right between the eyes
Then turned it on hisself cause he refused to live a lie
Suicide was against his beliefs
But knew it was the only way they'd ever find peace
