[Verse 1: Murs]
It's War and Peace, it's more than beef
Must uphold the call you swore to keep
It's life and death, it's blood and sweat
We fight for love and respect
It's man to man it's hand to hand
You make your fist, You take your stand
Prepare to throw down whenever it go down
Under pressure don't fold man hold your ground

[Prehook: Murs]
You got your pride and I got mine
It's all out war when you cross that line yeah

[Verse 2: Murs]
I'm from L.A. I grew up fightin'
After school no rules clash of the Titans
Writin' from experience is most of what you hearin' is flat-out bullshit these niggas ain't serious
Ain't never seen no parts of a fight
That's why they ain't got no heart in what they write
I walk wit' my head up, and down to go head up
If you can't walk the talk, then homeboy shutup
I'm fed up wit' these rappers gone wild
Cockin' back guns in mixtape, freestyles
You was a real man you would fight wit' your hands
Not hide behind security lyin' to your fans
I'm sizin' you up, anger risin' up
Let the first punch kill the butterflies in my gut
These guys is punks , y'all wisin' up
Fist tight starin' in your eyes like "what"

[Hook: Murs]
I stare without caring when I walk through the door
You see it in my eyes I been there before
I got my stories, I know you got yours
These are our scars, this is our war
I stare without caring while you looking at the floor
You see it in my eyes I been there before
I got my stories I know you got yours
These are our scars, this is our war
You got your pride and I got mine
It's all out war when you cross that line yeah

[Verse 3: Murs]
Knuckle up, get down where you mad at
Flat disrespect, I ain't gon' have that
No jaw jackin', I'm all action
I represent the real that's a real small faction
Down to scrap N' really know what's happenin'
Been bitten, been scratched, hit with helmets and bats
Had dudes try to jump me
Dudes try to stab me
Dudes who kept swingin' while security grabbed me
Trust me, I ain't for the trash talk
Jump up both feet stomp your brain in the asphalt
True stories I been through the gory
Blood everywhere more foo's comin' for me
You take your lumps, you wanna live the life
Adrenaline rush'll get you higher than a kite
Outside lookin' in don't know what it's like
You wanna make friends , you don't really wanna fight

[Hook: Murs]
I stare without caring when I walk through the door
You see it in my eyes I been there before
I got my stories, I know you got yours
These are our scars, this is our war
I stare without caring while you looking at the floor
You see it in my eyes I been there before
I got my stories I know you got yours
These are our scars, this is our war
You got your pride and I got mine
It's all out war when you cross that line yeah

[Break: Murs] Aye bruh imma keep it real for a second hold up

[Verse 4: Murs]
Too old for this shit, I'm almost 30
I might throw out my back, get my clothes dirty
Too much time on the grind for me to fail
To get into some beef, wind up in jail
Isaiah you had a good run
It's time to hang it up, man these pussys got guns
No more fair fights, no more fightin' for sport
Pick the wrong night N' get your life cut short
No honor, no respect for life
It's a issue when these bitches put pistols in fist fights
Cowards claim calibers, red beam silencers
All because they can't compete wit' real challengers
No gangs we don't hide behind colors
A real man shouldn't have to hide behind another
Take a loss like a man that's what bosses do
Cause you ain't a real boss till you lost a few

[Hook: Murs]
I stare without caring when I walk through the door
You see it in my eyes I been there before
I got my stories, I know you got yours
These are our scars, this is our war
I stare without caring while you looking at the floor
You see it in my eyes I been there before
I got my stories I know you got yours
These are our scars, this is our war
You got your pride and I got mine
It's all out war when you cross that line yeah

[Verse 5: Murs]
There's a code, it's rules and regulations
Passed down through time, and through the generations
Honor, discipline that's a warriors aim
The game has changed but the rules are the same
You never fight a man who doesn't wanna fight
Never fight other women unless it's blood and your wife
No knives no weapons unless he's bigger than you
If he a bully go bully then, split him in two
Your man lose pick em up take him home
Never fight another man's fight when he's wrong
Take these rules home, make em your own
For these are the steps towards taking the throne
