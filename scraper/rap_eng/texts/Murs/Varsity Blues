What up though?
Welcome to Varsity Blues
My personal therapy EP for colored boys

[Verse 1]
It's when you start to get a gut
And you don't go out as much
You and your own homeboys barely even stay in touch
You be doin' too much
You tryin' to build a career
Got a one bedroom and a fridge full of beer
You smokin' cigarettes like it's goin' outta style
Used to be strugglin now you gettin' dough in piles
On the real you haven't been truely happy in awhile
Yo mind ain't right cause you got issues on file
That you been building since a child and still haven't dealt with
Thanks to Hennessy and chronic you haven't felt shit
But once you sober up it's like your brain is blowin' up
You get headaches and can't sleep
You nervous for no reason
When everything is quiet you can hear ya heart beatin'
Start poundin' hella fast and you feel like you tweekin'
I'm speakin' to y'all who know what it's like
And might have to be on medication for the rest of ya life

[Hook]
It's for them varsity blues
To all of my dudes
Who hustle hard and never learnt the meaning of lose
It's for them varsity blues
To my backpackin' crews
Who hustle hard and never learnt the meaning of lose
It's for them varsity blues
To my rips and taboos(?)
Who hustle hard and never learnt the meaning of lose
It's for the varsity blues
To all of y'all who pay dues
Still hustle hard and never learnt the meaning of lose

[Verse 2]
It's when you been with the same girl for over a year
Knowing deep in your heart that marriage is ya greatest fear
How you supposed to settle down with all these ladies out here?
So many different types: Black, Latin, and White
Now ya girl might be tight, but she's not the only one
And this is your life and you got only one
To live, so live it up
Or do you give it up?
That's why I'm singin' the blues for y'all who know what's up
If your girl cheats on you, she's a whore, she's a slut
But if you do the same thing, you just bein' a man
Now we can truely understand what our fathers went through
I know you cheated on your girl and it's botherin' you
But she'll never find out cause she was out with the crew
And she can't be hurt by what she never knew
But deep down inside you wanna tell her the truth
But if you do, she might leave so what should you do?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's varsity blues cause I landed in
Most every hood activity and rap Mid City
To retire from these streets that for years attempted killin' me
My hood and dead homies will forever live in me
Keepin' me inspired through the drama life's giving me
I willingly sacrifice my life on these beats
So when I play it back I kill the demons in my sleep
Or at least to understand why I am the way I am
Mean-spirited and angry and I don't give a damn
Mad at the world, that's why I never had a girl
Incapable of lovin' anyone who could betray me
She made out with my best friend, it sorta drove me crazy
Along with the store that I opened down in AZ
And at the same time I blew the engine on my Cadillac
Cost me seven Gs so you know that set me back
Which eqauls varsity blues and panic attacks

[Hook]
