[Verse 1: Beleaf]
I swear y'all don't know about the west
You don't know nothing 'bout ridin' up the 5
View on the left
God gave us front row view to the sunset
Everybody think it's paradise
But we lost some real ones on the left
So what you know about the west
I swear y'all don't know about the west side
Nor'Cal So'Cal go ahead and rep
I feel like we the realest ones left
Let me tell you 'bout left

[Hook: John Givez]
Left coast, left coast
West side up high
Left coast, left coast
West side up high
Left coast, left coast
West side up high
Left coast, left coast
Throw your west side up high

[Verse 2: Ruslan]
I'll admit it, it's not perfect
Nah I take that back cause what I'm learning
You get what you pay for that's on purpose
So the cost of living is so worth it
Yeah the cost of living is so worth it
So I don't wanna hear any complaining from any person
That has not lived here cause that's an inaccurate version
And clear, I swear you ain't know about my town
Thinking it's another city by the ocean coast
And not a whole lot that be ever going down
(down, down)
As we coming up slow
On a ghost highway, only right to give a ode
Indescribable to tell you what I'm feeling in my soul
It's Cali
It's a California California California state of mind
It don't matter what you saying, what you selling
There's no way that you can ever really take my
Allegiance from the city with the view
You see us we the leaders
Of this era in this area, come meet us
And comedians be talking but no way they can defeat us
God made me for the west ever since I was a fetus
On the left

[Hook: John Givez]
Left coast, left coast
West side up high
Left coast, left coast
West side up high
Left coast, left coast
West side up high
Left coast, left coast
Throw your west side up high

[Verse 3: Murs]
Me I'm from the middle of the city of the angels
Dealing with these demons on the daily had to lay low
God's grace gave my face this halo
Tangled with them devils just a west side rebel
Trying to make the next level take it far from the ghetto
W up but my pants sag low
All the homies bang crip, never had a rag though
What I want a rag fo'? When I get the mad dough
A thick girlfriend with a new Rav-4
That was a dream was a junkie as a teen
Hip hop thing see I was a true fiend
But the scene was all G Rap, hoochies and weed sacks
My city so much mo' y'all gon see that
No strap but I was bustin' off of Crenshaw
Raw raps dodging all of them pit falls
Had the beats with the homie smoking indo
Tour bus with my name on the window
Did a little dirt, could have been a little worse
Couple homies got popped and that could have been Murs but
That's the grace I was speaking on
That makes me feel the wrong
Crowds wanna sing my song loud
When the beat is on now
That they see I'm on proud
That I be from home
Left

[Hook: John Givez]
Left coast, left coast
West side up high
Left coast, left coast
West side up high
Left coast, left coast
West side up high
Left coast, left coast
Throw your west side up high
