[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Yo, planetary rhythm, music expertise
We talkin' knowledge in the field, abilities increase
SirDZL, we don't mind it, I'm in debt with text
Tinted with a color pallet that will challenge the pest
Reverbial advantage, examine it
The beat's far for the freedom to dismantle it
But negative, it's irregular, we study the stare
Looked out upon a series that was hard to impair
Heir to the throne, perish the bones
The snare gets the tone to where this should go
The backbeat never taking a backseat
Verbal athletes have to eat at the track meet
That's me, DZL dude, seeping through the groove
The blood through the band aid, the mandate
The endorsement, the jazzy contortion
Sourced from the chord, the drum, me and more fun
For the listener, which is the mission of
These spokesmen of funk, flow gets ya pumped
Juiced, now your battery get used
Never misuse the vibe, the irresistible
I know Tre got to watch for I
The Antarctic Ocean ain't as cold as his vibe

[Verse 2: SlimKid3]
Yeah, I gets live
I dips and I dive, leave the past behind
While all I did was survive, I'm like "Why?"
Was the question, looking for the answer
Now I'm DYI, shit, I know who I am son
Take it to the hole, no control, get a [?]
Take what I deserve without the help of a handgun
A true man that provides for his fam'
One way or another got this world in my hands son
Some don't see it and they can't understand
But dwellin' in the problem's not a part of the plan
Tarot cards on the table, showin' me the way so
I'ma get the ends, pound, euro and the peso
Dollar all day yo, eliminate the fake, oh
Burn down the old format, black [?]
Cause it's prime time and anything less is a crime
What we posses is the design to bring you back
Back into groove on, why get your move on?
Middle school doin' thangs, keepin' the move strong
[?] on the [?], [?] call it the bouillon
My food for the soul'll get too young to get it

[Verse 3: Murs]
[?] monster, competition conquered
Grew up on Eazy-E and watching Cookie Monster
Eating chocolate chips with a whole lot of Crips
Got a mamma named [?] Colorado call her quick
Kung-fu grip on my Lady [?] action figures
Schoolyard bully, eat ya apple, then I smack ya sister
Boxing at the sheriff station, [?] youth
Always down to scrap with a gap, chipped tooth
Shout out to Booth (Yeah!) wherever he at
Used to rep with Lucky.PSC and [?]
Brother from a mystic planet, going on another journey
Hanging with the heartbreak, stopping and I hit my [?]
Ah, the young [?] say they love him, no
That was after school in the back by the bungalow
Trying to get under those [?] cause I go
Oops, I mean I wanna come, forget where yo' brother from
Nice with my hands, Golden Globes, I'm another one
Rappin' in Japan and I watch a lot of anime
What's love got to do? Going as Annie Mae
Bullocks where my mamma work, if you remember that
Meat me at Jacob's in your LA demo cap
[?] though, purple with some white and gold
Watching Chrunchyroll and [?]
I guess I told ya that I like to write
But yeah, I guess it's obvious I also like to fight
All you gotta do is give the homie a chance
I'm guaranteed to show you the hands
