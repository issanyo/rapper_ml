[Verse 1: Murs]
Pals
Eight years in the making
Taking life's stress and strife, recycled
And now a soundtrack for your life
The price?
Forget what you payed for this disc
I mean, what's a couple bucks for some art that's priceless
You might just of made, your best investment ever
So sit back, enjoy and profit off this musical endeavor
That was made for you to treasure
(You can see us?)
We're now a part of your life
And all mine was the pleasure

[Verse 2: Anacron]
Fuck you and all your homeboys
Five guys, zero talent at Taco Bell, trying to write rhymes
NT-Dub G, empty jugs be
Spewing bullshit with no substance and it bugs me
I get ugly on the mic and hoes still jock
Drippin' off the dredlock gangster on knock
Fools want to hear Cron rock
That's just one of those things
Thats a part of life, alright now stop dozing

[Verse 3: Himself]
Every time I leave the crib I got people hawking me
Niggas and bitches they all talking shit and stalking me
Asking me, "whats taking so long to drop another tape?"
Patience is a virtue, all you have to do is wait
Just because I rap don't mean I have loot
I only got two pairs of shoes and one pair of winter boots
I'm hustling just like you
And just like you I'm struggling my fucking way through life too
