[Verse 1]
Makes you
It makes you want to kill
It makes it hard to breathe
Just to much to deal, with
Go ahead and slit your wrists
Open up a vein til the pain don't exist
If this is all it takes to bring you to deaths door
Then what the fuck were you ever given breath for
Why waste energy on someone unworthy
Why even think about gettin' your hands dirty
So many members of the murder club
Live with regret, wish they never heard of love
Crimes of passion, mindless action
Makes you want to go grab a nine and blast 'em, huh
Hope you don't mind me askin'
What is of the game from this type of reaction
What type of satisfaction, do you hope to obtain
When you can't change what happened

[Hook]
Nothing hurts worse than a broken heart
Another love lost, life torn apart
Feeling like you should have known from the start
What was once light has become dark
Started off sweet with a bitter end
Now how you sit and think about is revenge
Gone insane can't contain yourself
Til the other half knows all the pain you felt

[Verse 2]
Never thought it would happen to me
So I never stopped to think what my reaction would be
It just seems so matter of fact
First they hurt you and then you hurt them back
But an eye for an eye leaves the world blind
A heart for a heart makes us unkind
Creates a world of the walking dead
Void of joy and purpose left to march ahead
Mindless zombies out for blood
The definition of death, life without love
How far will you go when push comes to shove
Why are you fighting for a feeling that never was
Hate for love becomes a love of hate
True vengeance knows not an expiration date
Become consumed by the hate you give
And soon you're the one left with a life unlived

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Put a piece of steel right through the chest
Show 'em that you really meant to the death
Sounds harsh what did you expect
When someone shows you no regard and such disrespect
Matters of the heart aren't to trifle with
So it's not your fault you're on some psycho shit
You can't choose who you love or the life you get
But you can choose to move on and be alright with it
When things aren't working out as you planned
And it's so unfair that you don't understand
How she can leave you for another man
Or how he ended up with her, makes you wonder, damn
Did they ever love you in the first place
Unrecorded love that's the worst fate
So you stay up late plannin' and plottin'
To make sure your pain is never forgotten

[Hook]
