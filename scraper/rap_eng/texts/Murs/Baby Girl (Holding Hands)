Look I’m the man with the plan
So baby girl won’t you hold my hand
Baby girl won’t you hold my hand
Baby girl won’t you hold my hand
Say girl Look, I’m the man with the plan
So baby girl won’t you hold my hand
Huh yo Baby girl won’t you hold my hand
Baby girl won’t you hold my hand
Aye, c’mon

[Verse 1]
I walked in with my pimp game strong
Baby girl, you know it’s been too long
You know I miss you much, them thick lips and that big ole butt
Your boyfriend, look he know he in trouble
He ain’t nothing but my new stunt double
And I’m the man you deserve
You know these squares can’t handle your curves
I only fucked up once, you know you love me, why did you wanna front
And I won’t see her no more, she’s just a chick that I met on tour
Now you playing hard to get like you did back when we first met
You know the truth when it’s told right
So baby girl grab my hand and just hold it tight

[Verse 2]
I was in grade three, she was a grade above
An older woman, it was crazy love
Didn’t know about the birds and the bees
I had just learned my ABC’s
Up behind her at the bus stop
Rubbing on her booty with my Batman lunch box
She was my date to the sock hop
I knew my time tables, plus I knew how to pop-lock
And it wasn’t a hard call
I bought her candy plus I beat her at dodgeball
Spray some TCB, overalls, one strap, I was BBD
Now I’m walking to her place
Binaca in my pocket, case I got up to first base
Picked her up at four and I went (holding hands)
