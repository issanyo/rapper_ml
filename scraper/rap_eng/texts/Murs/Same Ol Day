[Hook: Eric Biddines & Wrekonize]
Back against the wall ain't got no place to go
Feeling real good on a hood day, ya you know
Same 'ol thing with a brand new attitude
But when the sun don't shine at least you got the moon

[Verse 1: Murs]
We traded Kent for a catcher battin' 225
And a pitcher with an ERA that's way too high
Fuck my life, fuck my life, it's first world problems
I toss the K-Cup in the Keurig, I ain't worried bout 'em
It's hard not to get caught up
We must remember what the good book taught us
He never gives you more than you can handle
Absorb the bullshit and put it through the proper channel
Drop back and punt, that's what my mother say
Met me a new chick the other day
She was kinda cute in an ugly way
Feelin' hella good on an ugly day

[Verse 2: Eric Biddines]
Turn on the television, and I ain't even faded
I think my liver full of liquor I ain't even drank
I'm on some other shit, I made another plate
If you was me you probably wouldn't made it here today
My mama told me I was quiet in that belly cryin'
My daddy left before the skin on the chicken fried
We in the kitchen with the 'frigerator open wide
Ain't got no milk for drinkin', coffee black if I should cry
They wanna tell ya that I told ya
For me to preach I need ta show ya
I'm in a room full of roaches
Sometimes I'm scared to turn the lights on

[Hook: Eric Biddines & Wrekonize]
Back against the wall ain't got no place to go

[Verse 3: Bernz]
I don't know where my next check's gon come from
But I ain't unemployed, I'm just pursuing other outcomes
Like tweaking on this bass drum, and tweaking off this aged rum
Collecting all my thoughts instead of collecting some pay stubs
Time capsules for my generation's heroes and villains
Stories told while the trees are burning, campfires in us
What make us stronger are mistakes that should've already killed us
I find out holiest of people sometimes are the sinners
But I ain't gon' point fingers or name names
Cause everybody take a stumble in the jungle with snakes
So blaze your trail baby, you'll get paid
And don't worry what they say cause at the end of the day...

[Verse 4: Wrekonize]
It's just another who smothers all that you dreamed of
What do they know of this little humble to-be love
I'm running numbers and crunching up all my meal stubs
Just tryna get a second helping of the real stuff
This is perspective, sunny side of directive
But when the clouds get dark, my lady gets ultra protective
I got your back, you got mine, don't worry if they drop dime
Cause if we need to rock climb, I'll lift you, no stop signs
What're we supposed to do when we get pushed in the mud And stepped on?
And other things that boil our blood, we've kept on
No rock bottom stopping my flood, this is the last dam we got and I'm not planning to budge because...
