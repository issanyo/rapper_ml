[MURS speaking]
Say it the same way? Ha

[Verse One]
She was only 5'2" and she loved to argue
Girl had a mouth on her
Till it went south on her
Then I had to bounce on her
Yep, clean house on her
Now she's cussin' and she's screamin' standin' out on the corner
But I love her and I miss her
It was hard to dismiss her
When I know in three days I'm gonna get back with her
Damn

[MURS speaking]
That was the wrong verse. Hold up. Hold up. Aiight
It ain't about her. It's about this

I'm talkin' sunshine, blue skies
Dress lookin' too fly
Look good, feel good
How good? Real good
Health, wealth, knowledge of yourself
Your best friend being there when you need some help
Shelter, clothing, your car when it's rollin'
Thankful for the little things, that just keep growin'
Holdin' onto memories
Forgivin' all your enemies
Lettin' go of hate so you don't waste energy
Assemblies
Field trips
Remember that realness
Usin' inner strength
To you triumph over illness
Honesty, loyalty
Somebody that will spoil me
Love my dirty drawers and treat me like royalty
Checks
Respect
Posse in effect
MURS & 9th Wonder it's like B.F.F

A five hour flight
Touchin' down on the runway
Livin' out desire
Clothes fresh out the dryer
Seein' my name when they handin' out fliers
Shows when they sold out
Girls when they hold out
Girls when they give it up
Money, when I get a cut
Walkin' in the crib see your new born sittin' up
One life, one love, c'mon y'all, live it up

[Sample]
When you love it
So glad darlin' baby
