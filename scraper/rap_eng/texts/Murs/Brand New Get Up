[Hook]
Get out of your body
Get out of your cup
Get out your apartment
Get out and get up
Get out of tomorrow
Get up out the cut
Get up out the darkness
Get out and get up
You need to get up!

[Verse 1: Murs]
Get up, get out, cut that bullshit out
Word to Cee-Lo for the Green, I’ll put a motherfuckin’ hit out
Bullet in the Billboard charts, 'bout to kill the game
Load up the mic and make your favorite rapper feel the pain
B-b-b bustin’ at ‘em, it’s like we bussin’ atoms
About to blow the fuck up until we touchin' Saturn
And n-n-nothin’ matters, this life is just a dream
Why you just sittin’ there? Get up and touch the screen

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Top down music up, speeding down the interstate
Just so I could feel alive, just to feel my heart race
See I'm on my own shit, play me at your own risk
Broke outta my comfort zone and now I'm feeling focused
Running the DOW with a pack of wolves that are wild
And they hungry for somethin' new while you're sleeping I hear 'em howling
And what you give 'em? Bitch I'm in my feelings
I'm trying show you all was good but you just don't hear us

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
Get up and move like this may just be your last of chances
(Go, Go) I been taking all kinds of stances
This buildings cold as ice and prone to avalanches
I need you all to move through sexual advances
(Aww shit) I dig the way she dances
She could teach college classes on how to shake your asses (Twerk)
And if you unaware we making moves
You better just go request the juice and get it up to

[Hook]

[Outro]
She's bringing cupcakes? God damn, chocolate. God damn sauce. (I'm not eating any.) Yes you are. Yeah, I'm eating hers, what the fuck. You can't just deny what's coming to you, and throw it away. What the fuck kind of shit is that? I married your ass, I get your god damn cupcake. You don't just fuckin' bring it and send it back to the store and shit. If we were a government cheese line and you couldn't eat cheese, I would still eat your cheese (Hashtag)
