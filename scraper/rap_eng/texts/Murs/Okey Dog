[Intro]
Once upon a time there was a one man gang
Who never ran from anyone or sold cocaine
OGs in the city all knew his name
So here's a little story about the gang that he claimed

[Verse 1]
The hardest nigga I know, he from Okey Dog Crip
When he get up out the pen better hope he don't trip
Teriyaki or pastrami, he was always in some beef
A legend to this day, they talk about him in the streets
It's not a real hood, it's something that he made up
To piss gang-bangers off cause he never gave a fuck
He wore white Pro Wings, with pink and green strings
And dare anybody on the shore to say a thing
Seen him knock a lot of dudes out with one swing
By his side he always kept the baddest bitch you ever seen
Made his first million by the age of seventeen
Running credit card scams, never touched a triple beam
He was the king, everybody tried to trip on him
They would get confused when he Okey Dog Crip on 'em
Most of the time they would just start laughing
But they all got knocked out quick just for asking...

[Hook]
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?" (what?)
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?" (what?)
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?"
"Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none" (yep)
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?" (whoop)
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?" (whoop, whoop)
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?" (whoop)
"Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none"

[Verse 2]
The hardest nigga I know, he from Okey Dog Crip
Once knocked a nigga out, and he broke his own fist like this
In L.A you get hit up every day
The homie had to come up with something different to say
He like "no matter what I say they gon' always want to fight
I'd rather get in to it over something that I like
And the one thing I love in this world above all
Is the Teriyaki burger that they make at Okey Dog"
All he needed was a cause that he could get behind
He was always down to squab cause he won every time
Ever since we was little he could fight very well
Seen him whoop a grown man and we was only 12
Kept to himself unless they bothered him first
But like I was saying at the top of this verse
He busted up his hand on a bitch nigga's head
All because he walked up to my homeboy and said...

[Hook]
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?" (what?)
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?" (what?)
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?"
"Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none" (yep)
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?" (whoop)
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?" (whoop, whoop)
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?" (whoop)
"Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none"

[Verse 3]
The hardest nigga I know, he from Okey Dog Crip
He pulled out a chopper, told me "Focus in on this
This can make a man brave, this could make a man a slave
And once you pull it out ain't too many standing in your way
Trigger in your hand, you gotta understand
A lot of men use arms cause they ain't got hands
The shooter is respected much less than the gladiator
If you kill a nigga then his homies gon' get at you later
You square up, win some, lose some
I need to save the day like John Witherspoon, son"
Homie's almost out after 8 to 10 years
But I'mma say something that he might hate to hear
Look, now that I'm a grown man
Thirty something years and I'm out here tryna throw hands
It's green light for me to blast a motherfucker
So you better think twice before you ask a motherfucker

[Hook]
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?" (what?)
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?" (what?)
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?"
"Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none" (yep)
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?" (whoop)
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?" (whoop, whoop)
"Where you from, homie?
Where you, where you from?" (whoop)
"Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none"
