Fuck it

[Hook: Nina Katsuya]
So many names, so many faces
I could have had everything a different way but fuck it
And if I stay, bad habits would remain
Stuck in the same play so fuck it
What am I suppose to do?
What am I suppose to do?
What am I suppose to do?

[Verse 1: Breezy Lovejoy]
Yeah
It's hard to understand
I've been through so many phases and different lands
Sometimes I wonder if I'm on the right path
Or if I made a blunder, and missed my chance
Momma said I gotta pray and fast
But my old head told me it was simple mathematics
And god ain't gonna give me more than what I can stand
So as long as I'm standing, I got a chance to put my brand on this planet
Can't go out like my pops did
Drinking liquor till his liver got spots in it
It's like I only knew him for a hot minute
But every time we talk, it was long in it
The ghost from his past still haunts him
I could tell by the responses that I got from him
And on his last days, he left a message singing a song
But when I finally tried to call, he was gone

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
(Fuck it man)
I'd seen the places that they'd never seen
The view is different when you're sitting on a mezzanine
You see the bigger picture wave ya on a couple blocks
Look through the negatives then you figure out what to crop
Can't escape Babylon, I gotta tatted arm
But now I'm on that digital while you moving that analog
You sitting, you praying while the enemy's praying on you
You must be tripping thinking god has a magic wand
Brah, Korean Jesus ain't got time for your shit
He on the other line with a million other kids
You seeing the good life, through Instagram flicks
The filters we've applied as blood, tears and sweat
I ain't your competition nor am I your enemy
You shouldn't be feeling jealousy looking at my twitter feed
While I'm on this killing spree, it's killing me, you ain't
We were homies till you chose to play it safe

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Murs]
The only thing I never could do was lose for you
The way it's turning out I wish I could choose for you
This life truly is sink or swim
Hey, you can fuck around and drown trying to think for them
You don't begin a journey ending in the same place
You make some distant to the finish, it's the human race
You running on the clock, they're gunning for your spot
So much pain in your past that you don't wanna stop
I was dead broke, depressed, and on prescription drugs
Headed towards a tier in the county with the Crips and Bloods
Slanging texts in front of different clubs
Until my name started getting buzzed
And when you hear the buzz, it's time to take flight
I hit the road and all the haters saw was brake lights
So when you tell me that I've changed it's a compliment
How could I not when I done rocked on every continent

[Hook]
