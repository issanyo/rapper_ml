[Verse 1: Murs]
Our father, how great thou art
Your divine spirits help create my art
My biological was not around
Last name: 3:16, an underground
King of kings, lord of lords, my only savior
Hip-hop saved my life, I'm highly favored
God bless the b-boys
DJ's and the writers, shout out to Trouble T Roy
Pete Rock another prophet
Used the music like Moses to move, you can't stop it
It's God music, you can't deny it
My hand grabbed the mic and man, I sanctified it
You can't deny the divinity
Make you feel the power of life in your vicinity
Changed my life, I know that it changed yours
He gave us heaven but the streets is what you aim for
Need to use a flick of the wrist to aim higher
Spit to keep it lit, but keep us burning in the same fire
That's eternal like the shame is
Praise to the creator, whatever you say his name is

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
More spiritual than religious, I pray God forgive us
Try to live life the best I can but know I'm still a sinner
Ask my Auntie Del advice about this fellowshipment
I ain't baptized and I grew up a Jehovah's witness
In my heart I don't believe he'll shun you for different religions
If a heart good then we try to follow his wishes
Whether you're Muslim, Baptist, Mormon, whatever the difference
A lot of good people decipher the Bible quite different
Who's to say who's right or wrong, believing's prolific
Commandments the only thing that we probably agree with
I knew it's wrong to kill a life on occasion that Jesus
Died for our sins and I know atheists still don't believe it
I still pray regardless of the fact there good people
And because you don't believe in God, you still don't mess with evil
I pray everyday ask forgiveness for myself and others
And for good health for myself and family, I love you
I pray for ones I don't know yet and I never meet
I pray my heart's kind in my actions and my speech
I pray for patience, for listen way more than I speak
I pray for love, forgive me God, I know it's wrong, I'm weak
And lastly I pray for lives that you didn't choose to keep
We all ain't perfect but we trying at the very least
Every saint got a past and every sinner got a future
And I can't judge nobody I'm just passing thoughts to you

[Verse 3: Propaganda]
Listen I ain't never walked on water, I'm not at all a know-it-all
Just know enough to know that no one alone will keep you warm
There's things I can't explain like death and pain
And why suffering in rain seem to be the greatest teacher
And it seems to sneak up on you, eyes get swole up
Explosive as Hiroshima, my hoping your focus hold up
And that logic get faulty
Cold boulder stone for more shoulders, salty
And the stuff we can't touch seems to be much more real like
How we all connected and sing along to love songs
I believe these are Elohim's fingerprints
The sky above you is screaming "I love you"
There were times I felt hip-hop was God's gift just for me
Can't verify it, but sho' can't deny it
Colors and textures, I see beauty in scars
I have shaped my existence on his persistence
Knowable, relatable, God our Father, not a judgemental tyrant
Writing "guilty" on our eyelids
Scribbling eternity on black hearts and bars
While ancient Mayan astronomers could map the stars
Homie I don't claim to have the answers to your pain
I believe the Son of Man was slain to say we the same
A third day raising whether or not ya'll praise him
I just give you these songs to say you're loved and belong
Our Father
