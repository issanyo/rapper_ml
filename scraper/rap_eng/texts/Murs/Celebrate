Chorus:
Celebrations to steal life
Reminiscing to feel right
Remember what it would feel like
Sometimes it's better than real life
So we celebrate the memories
You can't replace the energy
Everything how it was meant to me
Conduct your dreams like symphonies

Verse 1:
I got a red line BMX
Saved up 6 months for them to see me flex
My boys on my block gave me my respect
But what I really hope is that it would lead to sex
Bad brown babe name of Deeana
Had the keys to the boys hearts, played them like pianas
Or pianos, hotter than a Roman candle
With her sheer sun dresses and her open toe sandles
Queen of the school in her P.E. shorts
Life goal is making out by the hand ball courts
Then one day she found out I sold pot
She said, slide your girl a J and I'll show you what I got
I said, Not like that, what I want is your heart
But we can smoke a dime bag if you meet me at the park
And when I found out she can roll her own weed
I was in love, so in love, brother yes indeed

Chorus:
Celebrations to steal life
Reminiscing to feel right
Remember what it would feel like
Sometimes it's better than real life
So we celebrate the memories
You can't replace the energy
Everything how it was meant to me
Conduct your dreams like symphonies

Verse 2:
We used to skate the court house in West L.A
Weekends, holidays, almost every day
I could, I was from the hood, but make that trip
2 hours back and forth, that was my favourite shit
No crips, no bloods, and no fake thugs
Just a bunch of skater kids, smoking on great bud
I sold drugs, but had plug on the music too
2 style (?) mixtapes, we laced the whole crew
A black dude, with some Jewish kids, bumping who
Snoop, Pharcyde, De La, just to name a few
I had a 'Fro, pro-Black like Spike Lee
But they got me back in to Ad-Roc and Mike D
MCA, rest in peace, ayo Mario C
He was a motherfucking beast
Bumping Ill Communication, sitting in my room
The So What You Want video made me take Shrooms

Chorus:
Celebrations to steal life
Reminiscing to feel right
Remember what it would feel like
Sometimes it's better than real life
So we celebrate the memories
You can't replace the energy
Everything how it was meant to me
Conduct your dreams like symphonies
