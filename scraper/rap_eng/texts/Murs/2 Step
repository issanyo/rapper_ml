At a time once upon it was MURS and pigeon john
Finally headed to studio to make this new song
J Beits was on production so of course it be the bomb
But they were kidnapped by two exotic women wearing thongs
Full figured with a switch they was sweet as liqourich
Of the red not the black but look back to my tale
They took their two favorite underground mcs to the 'tel
And what happen next I gave my word no to tell

I met her at the Bicycle Club last night
Yelling the card dealer trying to make a fight
I was in my Chucks and Dickies looking tight
I asked if we can talk and she said.......?
Treated her like a boulevard looked both ways before crossing
Just to make sure what this was costing (ching)
Cause I've been hurt before
And she looks innocent enough to settle the score come here

Chorus:
Now when you see me talking to a lady - step away
Little bitty girls like nitty (?) - step away
When your conversation's getting crazy - step away
You don't know no Hawthorne City - step away
When the alchol starts to fade me - step away
She's coke up but looks so pretty - step away
When you smell the opposite of daises - step away
Step away....

Like boom i'm in my Lamborgini
Pink just to make fools think
Put your hands up all my buddies buck buck
Little shimmy shams at my show to bring luck
To all my San Diego nickles in the place
Tatted up sleeve work sharks and it's free steak
Like lunch I'm having brunch with all you can eat punch
And MURS acting a fool

Wildin out about the place I slapped somebody in face
So we started slam dancing at a furious pace
Ah shhh mosh pit spread all around the club
Giving clothes-lines and hugs to the people that I love
Even slapped the bartender in his grill with a mug
Got drug out by security in the end
In the alley up against the wall they all had me hemmed
I called to my friend grand master PJ
He came through with some karate
To make them no neck muscle head geeks step away

Chorus

When you see me talking to a lady - step away
Little bitty girls like nitty - step away
When your conversation's getting crazy - step away
You don't know no Hawthorne City - step away
When this alcohol starts to fade me - step away
She's drunk but she looks so pretty - step away
When your breathe smells the opposite of daises - step away
Step away

I'm not very young I used to always be sprung
On very chicks of them I wrote and sung
But know I'm fine and I'm a dime piece
Walk like a whale sit calm and increase like

Boom we took off in my Caddillac
Zoom headed to Hollywood to hit the
Room my mind is like a flower in
Bloom you make an a** of you and me when you
Assume me and John will take your chicks because
We are extremely well groomed
