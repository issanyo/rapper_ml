[Verse 1: Murs]
Jogging through the junkyard, kicking the can
Never would I think I had the world in my hand
17 times, circumnavigate the globe
A traveler’s tradition, my religion is the road
Broke the mold, explored all the options
The quickest way to curate the cash, so I clocked in
On the job, no training wheels
Told my mama I'mma make it cause I say I will
Til the wheels fall off
Yes yes, y’all, 'till the beat it don’t stop
Between a rock and a hard place
Came up out the ghetto with my boys, no Scarface
But is my mind playing tricks?
If the world is really mine how I ain’t got shit?
Still they stop and they frisk
But it’s never gonna change till we stop and resist

[Hook: MNDR]
Listen, listen, if you want it up
Till the sun is up, then you’re one of us
So listen, listen, and start letting go
If we’ve had enough, we don’t give a fuck
No more control, no no more
No more control, no no more
(Control, control, control, control)

[Verse 2: Murs]
Welcome to the world of drug dealers
Comic books, white girls, and real niggas
Skateboards, bandannas, and malt liquor
Japanese cartoons and straight killers
They tell us get out the ghetto and get rich
But when you really a rebel you don’t fit
We all tryna find our niche
Got to grab it by the throat and make the world your bitch
It’s the American way
Plug into the drive and let the narrative play
We obsessed with nothing but the best shit
Do it on your own or be a drone with a death wish
Defy definition, repress repetition
Get money, get high, get sex, the addiction
The depression, the stress, the affliction
Get ready, get set, go, we on a mission

[Hook]
Listen, listen, if you want it up
Till the sun is up, then you’re one of us
So listen, listen, and start letting go
If we’ve had enough, we don’t give a fuck
No more control, no no more
No more control, no no more
(Control, control, control, control)

[Verse 3: Murs]
They had a rally for police brutality up at the park
But when we killing ourselves don’t nobody want to march
We got to start to take a look in the mirror
If we don’t respect ourselves then they always gone fear us
If black lives matter then black lives matter
And the color of the killer shouldn’t even be a factor
Most of these rappers ain’t equipped to lead
Cause most of these rappers illiterate, can’t read
This is educated street music for the educated street movement
It’s fucked up what the police is doing
But motherfucker look what we doing

[Hook]
Listen, listen, if you want it up
Till the sun is up, then you’re one of us
So listen, listen, and start letting go
If we’ve had enough, we don’t give a fuck
No more control, no no more
No more control, no no more
(Control, control, control, control)
