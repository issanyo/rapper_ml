[Verse 1:Murs]
I'm in a black band I got a black girl
But I don't make music for the black world
I'm a black man, black as midnight, blacker than Flava Flav and [?] in a fist fight
I get black balled when black rappers come around
I'm too black for the motherfucking underground
The white fans barely tolerate my black ass
If I embrace them, I catch a backlash
From the black fans
It's so crazy yo, I sold out if I'm on the black radio
But fuck them and fuck that shit
Y'all can all open up your white teeth and eat a black dick

[Hook: Murs]
To the white black boys (black and white)
To the black white girls (black and white)
Lets fight back with this noise (tonight's the night)
And attack this world (tonight's the night)
For the black white boys (black and white)
And the white black girls(black and white)
Fight back with this noise(tonight's the night)
And attack this world(tonight's the night)

[Verse 2: Murs]
They say that rocks white
They say I walk white
They say a lot of shit
They even say I talk white
Cause I like to say like, stoked, and dude
I was wearing tight jeans way before that shit was cool
I like The Cure, I like the Depeche Mode
I love Big Pun and of course I respect Hov
I'm a walking contradiction
Cause I don't speak Ebonics or some contrived fiction
I speak in sentences, I am literate
Sorry i don't fit a category for you idiots
I am just me, you should adjust you
And if you can't understand that fuck you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Murs]
Does this shit sound black?
Does this shit sound white?
Can it just be sound?
Can that be alright?
You should listen with your heart
You shouldn't listen with your eyes
Never listen with your ears
Because the heart never lies
It's soul music, what color is your soul
I bleached mine and I painted it gold
Hold me to nothing more than being human
Exact same color as the dreams I'm pursuing
Assuming you and I are consuming the same bullshit and the same fast food
Then we are all doomed
The end is coming soon
The government will throw all our bodies in the same tomb

[Outro]
