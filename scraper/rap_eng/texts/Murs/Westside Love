[Verse One]:
Real cute, spending loot, Fairfax
5'2, baby blue Air Max
Hair pulled back, nails did up
I said, "Call me anytime you wanna get..huh"
Up north got a chick from Humbolt
White girl, dreadlocks with the good smoke
Got caught, went to jail trying to sell dope
Police asked me if I knew her I said, "Hell no"
Had a lawyer broad, she kept me out of trouble
Cute face, brief case with a nice bubble
Seattle girl, get to snuggle with on rainy days
Had to leave, hadn't seen the sun in 80 days
So I made my way up to Van City
Sweated at the boarder, but the girls are so damn pretty
Really
There's beauty everywhere you go
But I found my love in the 5-2-O

[Hook]:
And you could be my west side love
Together we gone show them how the west side does
Back when we was popping that's the best I was
Come on and let's show them about the west side cuz, uh
You could be my west side love
Together we gone show them how the west side does
Back when we was popping that's the best I was
Come on and let's show them about the west side blood

[Verse Two]:
One chick from Oakland, she down for business
The other one from Frisco, they always set tripping
She like the 9er's the other like the Raiders
It's all about the Dodgers so I told them both "Later"
In the 5-O-3, they always go nuts
I had this crazy broad put voodoo on my donuts
At El Cholo, I met this chicana chick
Short hair, named Bianca she was kinda thick
Couldn't deal with the brown and black politicking
She cut me off before her homeboys started tripping
I got a gangster chick, she's from the projects
Always wear a bandanna anytime we have sex
Punched my ex in the face and through up a gang sign
Some of y'all think I'm playing but I ain't lying
We broke up, she got back with her baby dad
But I still got love for her crazy ass

[Hook]:
And you could be my west side love
Together we gone show them how the west side does
Back when we was popping that's the best I was
Come on and let's show them about the west side cuz, uh
You could be my west side love
Together we gone show them how the west side does
Back when we was popping that's the best I was
Come on and let's show them about the west side blood

[Verse Three]:
East coast, west side Manhattan
Upscale, her fingernails platinum
Sex In The City, drinking cosmos and everything
Smoking cigarettes going hard for her wedding ring
Any size and shape around the world
Bonita Applebums or Around The Way girls
I love you all
You're so damn attractive
And if you need them I got crazy prophylactics

[Outro] [Murs speaking]:
Ha ha. I want to show love to-to-to really all the ladies (all of y'all) around the world, know what I'm saying (I love you)? Especially all up and down the west coast (west side). Out to 8-0-8 to far west coast all the Hawaiian, beautiful women (what up?). You know, fuck it. All the-all the beautiful girls everywhere (all of y'all. Every single one of y'all). If you're not from the west side (don't worry about it), don't worry, you know what I'm saying? Let one of the west coast niggas swag you the fuck out. We'll converse you baby. To all the esse homies, all the Blood homies, all the Crip homies. And once again, for all of y'all not from the west side, don't trip. Esse, esse, means 'friend' (It just means 'friend'. That's all). Ski Beatz (yeah). Old Weird Harold on the keys. And fuck D-Rich (ha ha). I'm out
