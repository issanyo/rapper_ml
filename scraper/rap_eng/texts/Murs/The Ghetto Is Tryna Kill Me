[Verse 1: Murs]
Shiiiit, (swag, swag)
Rock on, rock on
Take that cocaine mix it with the baking soda
On the west coast they would say you cooking yola
Hold up, wait that's a different swag
I'm on some full pound shit
You on that nickle bag
Dime bag Darryl
Rest in peace bro
Shout out to Danny D
Coolin' on the east coast
Hardcore hip hop with some punk in it
Criss cross, bee bop put some monk in it

[Hook: Murs]
Swag, swag, swag

[Verse 2: Murs]
Rock on ,swag
Swag on Thelonious
Artists one dimensional will always be the loneliest
Need to change up
Need some evolution
And this ain't enough
Need some restitution
A black president just ain't enough homie
Four hundred years of oppression
That's tough homie
40 acres and a mule
I need my Spike joint
So if you gonna act a fool than make the right point

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Murs]
Rock on, point
Points on your album bitch
They make a million way before you make a thousand trick
I'm independent militant and I'm making money
Im like the panthers but a fortune 500 company
Revolution going strong since the 70s
So if you ain't gettin' money than you better be
Id rather be swaggin on my heavy metal shit
Then to be you and wind up dead in the ghetto, bitch

[Outro]
