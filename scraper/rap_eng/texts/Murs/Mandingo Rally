[Verse 1: Murs]
Black righteous space, I might catch a case
I be higher than a spaceship, but as soon as the bass hits
I become an escapist, back to the basics
Hip hop basics and a project basement
How you seen god if you never free base kid?
Meditation, transcendental, my band is the band that bans instrumentals
Yoga, yogi, cigar stogies, pigs raid the crib and they try to fold me
Tibet, Nepal, Masonic Halls, project hallways, taj mahal
Dichotomy, diatribes comedy
Ain't shit funny bout dying in poverty
Honestly, follow me, greeks stole astrology
Then they went crazy and crash the economy
Fuck the Odyssey and economic policy
Economic sanctions sanctioned sodomy.

[Hook]
I am cosmic, I am constant, I am conscious
I am tainted, toxic, and I love to talk shit

[Verse 2]
It's fucked up you depend on me
New Nike Airs and Nintendo Wii
Yeezy, Weezy, Jeezy, Breezy
Fuck me, I wanna kill my TV
Niggas in Paris, niggas of the day make a nigga embarrass
Where was the science, righteous, rasta, rebellion, defiance
Relying on crack babies, to make a difference, now ain't that crazy
Praise be with a g that raise me, cause all this bullshit today don't phase me
Whole rap ain't respectable, and corn ain't a vegetable
What you did is regrettable, and just because you black
Don't make it acceptable
Incredible ignorance, endangers the innocent
All for the benjamins, manipulating minds for the monetary benefit

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
All blacks ain't brothers, just cause we the same color
Still a punk motherfucker, live like a man or die like a sucker
Never stutter, stand by your word, respect the game or else get served
And you got some nerves, just another nerd that was raised in the burbs
Race traitor, call me a hater, sell out your people for profit and paper
Ain't nothing sacred, living in the state of supreme self hatred
We're doing it to ourselves, without the white man's help
In and out the jail, how the fuck you raise a son inside of a cell
We're doing it to ourselves, without the white men's help
In and out the jail, how the fuck you raise a son inside of a cell?

[Outro]
Get the fuck off your cell phone
