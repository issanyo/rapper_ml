[Intro]
Uh hi, everyone
My name is Murs, and uh
Yeah, I've had a rough couple years
But uh, you know
I guess I was depressed
I don't feel depressed anymore
Uh, you know I'm just at this point where I'm not too high
And I'm not too low, I'm just here
And that's okay
And there's a word for that
It's called 'melancholy'
Yeah

[Verse 1]
They say that happiness is a choice
Well, I guess they get to choose
Put all them so-called friends with they fake ass grins
Ain't never been in my shoes
Had my back up against the wall
'Bout to jump up off the edge
Just paid for a shrink but she made me think
That the problem's all in my head
So with that said, I went solo
On my own tryna face my fears
So I stopped popping pills, and it all got real
So I started writing this right here
And it took me years to get to this point
Where I don't wanna die every day
You can't put it in your mind to be down all the time
'cause the sun go shine anyway

[Chorus]
I been walking down this road, eyes closed
Reaching for a future that I cannot hold
Blindfold, eyes closed
Reaching for a future that I cannot hold
And it takes a toll on my soul
Said it takes a toll on my soul
Walking down this road, eyes closed
Reaching for a future that I cannot hold
Don't mean to make you feel bad
Because you think that I'm sad
No need for you to feel sorry
Bro, I'm just melancholy
Don't mean to make you feel bad
Because you think that I'm sad
No need for you to feel sorry
Bro, I'm just melancholy

[Verse 2]
Now I heard they call me crazy, I just act like I can't hear
But they ain't had it this rough or even lost as much
As I did in just one year
Have you ever had the feeling like you don't wanna die
But like, wait, still not wanna be here
That fog roll in and them days get dark
And it start getting hard for you to see clear
I know that pain too well, I swear I been through hell
If I don't smile, oh well, just worry 'bout yourself
I tell 'em leave me 'lone, I'm just in my zone
But some people can't take the hint
When my life so strange, I been through so much change
Why would I need yo' two cents?
But everybody got they ideas
On how to make my pain go away
But opinions is just like a SoundCloud page
Everybody got one these days
So you can kill the interrogation
'Cause you only wasting your time
If you mind your business then I mind mine
And everything gon' be just fine

[Chorus]
I been walking down this road, eyes closed
Reaching for a future that I cannot hold
Blindfold, eyes closed
Reaching for a future that I cannot hold
And it takes a toll on my soul
Said it takes a toll on my soul
Walking down this road, eyes closed
Reaching for a future that I cannot hold
Don't mean to make you feel bad
Because you think that I'm sad
No need for you to feel sorry
Bro, I'm just melancholy
Don't mean to make you feel bad
Because you think that I'm sad
No need for you to feel sorry
Bro, I'm just melancholy
