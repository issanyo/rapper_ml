[Hook]:
I'm bummed
Again, I always seem to find myself feeling like we're old friends
Ooooh
Now I'm numb
I've succumbed
To the ruder attitudes of bums
All the chaps who flap their little gums to get me bummed

[Verse One]:
What's up poor friend, it looks like it's me and you again
Sucking on this cigarette while I'm sipping on this Hen
It's been a minute since we kicked it
I admit it's not always the best conditions that I get a chance to kick it with ya
But here we are, sitting in my car
Down on our luck, looking up at the stars
The good times seem so far away
The last time I felt happy? Man, it's really hard to say
Listening to chumps got me down in the dumps
I'm guessing that what they want is to have me in a slump
Tried to get over the hump but couldn't carry the load
Fell flat on my face at the fork in the road
Under so much pressure it was easy to fold
All my funny style friends left me out in the cold
See I was told
That hard times travel fast
So it didn't take long for them to bite me in the ass

[Bridge]:
You shuffle with your left
Shuffle with your right
Shuffle with your left
Shuffle with your right
Shuffle with your left
Shuffle with your right
Shuffle with your left
Shuffle with your right

[Hook]:
I'm bummed
Again, I always seem to find myself feeling like we're old friend
Ooooh
Now I'm numb
I've succumbed
To the ruder attitudes of bums
All the chaps who flap their little gums to get me bummed

[Verse Two]:
I got my elbows on my knees
I'm in a deep freeze
Them ice cold blues got me lost out at sea
Trapped in my feelings now the floor is my ceiling
Locked in a spin cycle but my friends think I'm chilling
A spin doctor
I pop pills then vodka
Concoct a cocktail to get me through this soap opera
I'm on the top then my life's on the rocks
It's like it's my own cyclone, when will it stop?
Drop to my knees and I plead for the better days
Had lots of dreams but it seems I've been led astray
Dismay and doubt, which way is out?
Struggling with doubt as I scream and I shout for help
But it falls on deaf ears
It seems like the blues are getting all of my best years
Tears fall on hard times it don't make 'em soft
I twist up a two step hoping I can shuck 'em off

[Bridge]:
You shuffle with your left
Shuffle with your right
Shuffle with your left
Shuffle with your right
Shuffle with your left
Shuffle with your right
Shuffle with your left
Shuffle with your right

[Hook]:
I'm bummed
Again, I always seem to find myself feeling like we're old friend
Ooooh
Now I'm numb
I've succumbed
To the ruder attitudes of bums
All the chaps who flap their little gums to get me bummed
