[Intro]
It's not the end
It's the beginning
The law surrounds you
The court tries you
The jail engulfs you
But...
It's not the end
It's the beginning!
Darkness conceals your saving soul

[Verse One: The Grouch]
Really I'm gonna make you see
Silly, I'm gonna break through the
Wall, set up the storm
I track 'em all
In step with the future
Used to misconceptions just erected
Any way I know
Many say I flow but others want to hate
When they can't relate
And I can't debate opinions
But I've been in and out of my zone
Sometimes thinning out with my tone
But for the most part I'm consistent, distant
Tweakers want to speak upon an issue
Try and diss you
Cause they're on somebody else's dick
Who probably can't get with you
I mean, probably can't get with me
I mean, probably can't get shit we
Already have attained
It takes some talent, takes some game to make it valid
Make a name, see if change is the range
Of perspectives on what's fresh and what's left
Over

[Verse Two: Sunspot Jonz]
Inching right past the competition
Belief that I ambition to be great, equals mission
Statements, complacement, no reason for your dissin'
We sell tapes to {???} and other folks who listen
With me upon the base, new reality is given
Always flipping my objective in this life that I'm livin'
Legends: tremendous, plus Seven
That's my nickname in the Bettis
I'm a Bus like Jerome with the microphone's position
On like the first wave of cable: SELECT
P.N.C. means you want someone who's able
Competent, confident, optimist, lyricist, prominent
Juggernaut of low-key music that you ain't jockin' yet
But we'll respect, and get it back
If you project the simple fact
Odysseys and policies, when I construct to keep my rap
Up to par, strip the bar, rhythmic with inflation
Style the way I speak, and I stray away from fiction

[Verse Three: Aesop Fables]
You done lost your mind
And find a ??RZA kind fate??
Much more annoying than blue balls on a ??? date
Just can't wait to deflate ya'll airheads' flow
The black group (??)
Most potent arsenic to rid the world of rodents
That dared tread against our zone of defense
Of that which sickens the stomach of hip hop consumption
Legends: yeah we know, from rippin' you weak clones at functions
Fulfilling dreams at shows, with flows that's saying something
Catch that glimpse of intense pressure
Can't measure your talent on a balance beam
Your team: sure to gram
These Legends: sure to slam
Like Denny's having your fans counting their pennies
Towards this classic collaboration
To have the outsiders constantly hatin'
Solitude, barkin' with no bite
You can't swallow food
Fool, there's a difference between a battle and suicide
You're running from your shadow but there is nowhere to hide
I'd suggest test some skills before replacements come to kill
The weak style you feel that's all mushy inside
I'm not your ordinary guy
I'm the hero, the Superfriend
Known for reading you weak-ass clones (like TAROT CARDS!)

[Sung: Choral]
Revenge is a virtue
You stood up like you should
Standing up strong
Like we all wish we could
You're a shining symbol
A shining symbol
A shining symbol
Of black pride!

[Verse Four: Eligh]
Hot summer nights under my room light
I write everlasting poems
Like U.S. gunfights for oil on foreign soil
Zones boil
It ain't right like tin foil in the microwave
Spoil our children's day
Before it begins, wade
We live in sin to get paid
Like a skin wampsack, I want my money back
Like a tax rebate, or last night
Westin through the gates
Wag the dog, through the fog, see the running hogs
I feel like Phineas Fogg holding a gun with a deadly one
If you can't come close to me
You need to be buying the tape like you supposed to be
Poetry, showing he who blessed the mic
Show some light, and life he see
That's a dope MC
Be at eight-key{???} right over realities
Speak of duality
Your identity is your soul
From ancient stories told
Never to be a slave or sold
We must break the mold
Do you know your role?
Oh you know? Oh, oh-oh-oh, hah
[Nowhere to go
Cornered in the world of lost souls
Nowhere to go
Cornered in the world of lost souls]
Now the feeble tend to weep steeples
About the glorious past
Attempt to conduct a symphony
Of phony ghost stories stuck in the last
Scene of a fiend
Broken glass, a lit bottle of kerosene
I spit on models, embarrassing
Search and search and try to remove
Recognition from a team
Living Legendary entities
Just for the sake of small rhyme
Breaking the mold with small minds
The largest joke of all time
Let's call it the {watch it} in control
Flow over with beats of a lion
Dress these dreads up, flying heads back
With a simple taste, a ripple in time
What could explode
"X" marks the spot in spark mode
We crock the pot in the lung {tapper}
In the dark, we start the night-mode
Psychos with twisted light bulbs
Get sucked up in the cyclone
Drownded in the tide of a microphone
Eligh knows the right road

[Verse Five: Murs]
Explore the possibilities
Limitless, a seamless fit
Us in dreads, rhymes dispense Pez
Completely flipped my head
This one slipped out
Ripped out a sheet of brain tissue
You see, rhyme's a main issue
Just likely enhancing this
Might be your chance to dance
Or song and tune
Me and Miss Lopez, center floor, Conga Room
On the fumes of my dreams, I run this race
Murs guaranteed to blow your mind like a gun-in-face
And once in place I'm not budging
Just like a mom who opens the door
On two kissing cousins
Now that's a state of shock
Hate to rock beats with no soul
We remix the old
Reissued on Polygram
Put the Legends on the shelf
We stand out like holograms
A Symbol, Shining
Redefining what you thought of your local rap scene
For the poison in the music, we became the vaccine
