03-16, a G was born
All the doctors gathered 'round to see me perform
When I was four, had my first fight
It's like this Blood and this Crip shit was my birthright
Chipped my tooth playing ball in the front yard
Shopping cart to the grill hit me hella hard
Pop Warner, my first porno
Ninja Turtles came out, no DiGiorno
Late 80's, no Nintendo
Had a little loot but not as much as my friends, so…
Divorce court, back in the hood with no child support
Guns pulled, knives pulled, fools tried to jump me
Now I tell stories bout it all around the country
Swear to tell the whole truth as I'm living my life selling soul from the booth
And if the proof is in the pudding
Then I'm living proof you should do what you shouldn't

[Tom Cruz]
Once again, yo, it's on again
Yeah, it's on again
Tell your mom and friends that it's on
Cause you was wrong again
You was wrong, my friend
Cause it's on again, I'm a don
Once again, it's my life!
Just my life!

[Fat Tony]
I'm a fetus (whoa), damn I can't believe this (wow)
Came from the nuts, straight out my daddy penis
If women are from Venus, and niggas are from Mars
That's probably why my parents fought hard
Yellin' all night, workin' all day
That to me was the American way
But now they growin' old and goin' gray, and all they wanna say is
"Baby, you my baby, let's just stay together every day"
When the bad hits, the bad hits
But statistically, you'll eventually get in some good shit
I had a job but was still living like a damn slob
A jerk boss, my living costs were a real prob
He loved to play golf, wouldn't let me take a day off
Wanted to break jaws, but he'd probably call the dang laws
So I took like forty shifts and never showed up for that shit
And now I'm living with his bitch while he trims the premises
When the bad hits, it's some sad shit
The last laugh… now that's what I call bliss

[Tom Cruz]
Once again, yo, it's on again
Yeah, it's on again
Tell your mom and friends that it's on
Cause you was wrong again
You was wrong, my friend
Cause it's on again, I'm a don
Once again, it's my life!
Just my life!
