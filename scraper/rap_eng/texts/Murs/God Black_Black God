[Verse 1]
They waving guns in South Central, same on the southside
I gotta be a real nigga, just to stand outside
I'm on the corner with my main man T Smith
The streets done changed since they legalized the green shit
Need a new hustle now, gotta get up under now
Flip a franchises, nigga need about a hundred thou'
Do it like Nipsey did, but I'm not a 60 crip
Up on Slauson Ave, I'm supporting black businesses
Gotta be black-owned, money is the backbone
Gotta stick together like Terrace and his saxophone
Hoodsters, hoovers, trays and the deucers
Let's all get together man and make some maneuvers
Homie's got grandkids on some grown-man shit
Cream of the crop, we the kings of the planet
Used to be slaves, now look at what we made
We some leaders but we leading these people to the grave

[Chorus]
God Black/Black God, they don't understand
We come from black, return to black, that's the motherland
The universe expands and then we start again
To free the mind of every man, that's the fucking plan

[Verse 2]
I'm the great debater, both sides of the equator
See the truth, be the light, use it like a lightsaber
Dark skin, Darth Vader and I'm sorta like SEGA
They don't make 'em like me no more, there's none greater
Broadcast Dreamcast, me and 9th, we blast
12-gauge shottie, why you still shooting bean bags?
Think fast, we don't slack when we attack
Move like a Japanese cat in all black
Rooftop to rooftop, hip-hop to new rock
Now they selling T-shirts and 2 socks with 2Pac
Too hot to handle and we, too cold to hold
Send a couple nudes then I set some new goals
I'm tryna get her home, get it on, never sit alone
Freak these tales man, you know the type of shit I'm on
Badman, mad fans coming out the badland
Drop hands, now I'm getting head like a CAT-scan

[Chorus]
God Black/Black God, they don't understand
We come from black, return to black, that's the motherland
The universe expands and then we start again
To free the mind of every man, that's the fucking plan

[Verse 3]
I'm a midtown champion, Picco to Jefferson
I'm a 9th grader on a 9th beat, it's not a fresher man
I'm the secret weapon man, hoodie when I'm stepping in
A nigga been eating, I'm the one who put the pepper in
Behind home plate, had to dodge a game, [?]
Sipping on Coronas with a big booty Mexican
Fuck what you suggesting man, definition heaven in
Assuming that my name is on the list and they let me in
Angels and demons, all need a place to be in
Something like Raiders fans in the Oakland Colosseum
See I'm like a deity. Settle from the plea of these
If you wanna see me get some glasses like DMC's
Telescope, tell us quit, all of y'all irrelevant
Super-artificial, ain't never been intelligent
Heaven-sent but hellbend on keeping shit Godbody
West, where the East, fuck with a nigga, I hardbody
