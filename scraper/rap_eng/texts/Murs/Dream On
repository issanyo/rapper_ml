[Intro:Murs]
If you ain't dreamin', what you doing?

[Verse 1: Murs]
I dreamt of this day ever since I was a small child
And when it finally came the sky was filled with rain clouds
But when she came out, it all cleared up
That's when his boy became a man and put his fears up
I teared up as we started to say our vows
No more "me", it's all about "us" now
And the children we bring into this union
Never thought I'd live to see my dreams come true, man

[Verse 2: Dee-1]
Look, all I know is marriage, pops and moms did it
Grandparents did it, both stayed committed
At least I think so, but I can't go a day without dreaming
Of seeing myself married to Hip-Hop without a queen
And I refuse to be that old, lonely dude at home watching porn
Forty plus lurkin' around the college dorms
And uh, speaking of kids, I got a kid on the way
Nah I'm kidding but I dream to have 2 one day
Yeah

[Hook]
What's a dream without a dreamchaser chasin' it
And what's a fear if you have no fear of facin' it
It's not a dream once reality replaces it
So dream on, dream on
What's a dream without a dreamchaser chasin' it
And what's a fear if you have no fear of facin' it
It's not a dream once reality replaces it
So dream on, dream on

[Verse 3: Murs]
I've never been that dude that was dreamin' about the limelight
I just wanted to have fun and keep my rhymes tight
And then the fame came, now I'm a big name
I opened up my heart, and started spittin' game
So influential, helping you reach your potential
I hit the booth and touch truth to the instrumental
But really, what does it all mean
If you can't help others to fulfill their dreams

[Verse 4: Dee-1]
New Orleans is moated murder and mardi gra
Ima' show em'
Through the verses I'm flowin' through the seas that I'm sowing
Showin', provin' and doublin' to excel is just the beginning
Picture me rockin' stadiums, going platinum we winnin'
I lead an army of solders and beautiful, brilliant women
To dream as big as I do and expose the people pretending
Ha, they ain't real man
They're just real lost
It's hard times but these cowards still soft

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Dee-1]
Look, I dream I please God everyday that I'm alive
I dream that even when I'm gone my music never dies
I hate when I backslide, I pray I change that
My dreams and God's purpose
I hope they're on the same track
And I remember way back in '06
With that gun on my head, man I thought I was dead
Speaking of dead, a man's not alive just because he's breathin'
No purpose equals no freedom
Rise up

[Verse 6: Murs]
I had a dream that God looked like me
Clarence, 13 exit I was G-O-D
Can I admit, that kinda went to my head
But really who is God if he can't bring back the dead
With that said, in my dreams we live forever
No divisions of religion because we all in this together
Wake up, cause death is closer than it seems
And too many of us die before we try to live our dreams
