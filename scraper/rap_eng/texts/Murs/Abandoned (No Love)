[Hook: Anacron]
There ain't no love here no more
Just me between a glass ceiling and a lead floor
In front of a plastic door marked nevermore
There ain't no love here no more
Just me between a glass ceiling and a lead floor
In front of a plastic door marked nevermore
There ain't no love here no more

[Verse: Anacron]
Y'all niggas ain't cool
I ain't got no love for Y'all two-faced, backstabbing ass fools
We used to be straight
Shit was all great
Until you punk motherfuckers chose to show your true colors
Frontin' on a nigga cuz you wanted my ho
Even though I was the reason you was making some dough
Doin' shows and slangin' tapes in the go
Fuckin' fine freaks and gorgeous groupies
I was the focal for the little fame you came
Riding on my coattails, claimin' my name
When I went through hard times and shit wasn't crackin'
You gumps turned coat like reversible jackets
No where to be found
No hugs, no pounds
What a way to find out your crew of niggas wasn't down
Imma a clown when I see you
And that's on the dub
Cuz no nuts niggas get no love

[Verse: Himself]
Every time we talked we had to shout
You never understood what the fuck I was talking about
Wasn't no healing
We all go feelings
Having beef but we still was chillin'
Talking shit, talking loud
Both too proud to back down
Pull our pants up and our hat down
Like we was going into war
Cool for a second then start arguing some more
Trying to trap me by the door
I couldn't take it no more
The weed was no use
I became a recluse to get my mind tight, my nerves lose
I heard beat, I got along with no sleep
I only get about 20 hours a week
And its colder in the heat
I keep my toes to the street
And be careful of the bitterness that grows in me
Thats what was told to me
By the elders and it was gold to me
And the said never let love let go of me

[Hook]

[Verse: Anacron]
You abandoned me
Understanded these
Things I was going through
Holding you seemed to bring
A false sense of security to life lived unclear
Then from here you, disappear
It was fear that made me depend on another earth bound being
For worked out inner peace
In the end, after the laughter seized
I released you and became depend on me

[Verse: Himself]
Please don't go
Don't leave home
You know how much I hate it when you walk on
Don't worry I won't be gone long
Ida hit the world for my face to be shown
Let my name be known
There's some shit you gotta learn on your own
But love never came back she left me alone
Now I got my feelings alone
Until love decides to come back home

[Verse: Murs]
She asked me was I lonely cuz I stay on the road
I said, "no I'm not lonely, I'm just alone"
But thats the way it's been since I abandoned home
Family abandoned me, I was sleeping where I could
Thinking "why can't they see, I just wanna be me"
Do what comes natural
It wasn't like I wanted to
More like I had to flow, perform tracks at open mic's
They wanted a degree, I wanted my rhymes tight
In hindsight, I wouldn't change a thing
Having no one to depend on is strange but it brings
A sense of self and inner strength you just can't imagine
The trick not to focus on them hard times you having
But the lessons being taught
A knowledge and experience that can't be bought
In this world you all you got
And that's you and only you
You may acquire a companion
Some friends that call you crew
But you leave this plane solo
Complete within oneself
Once you master that you won't need nobody else
But it helps
I'd be a fool to say it didn't
And when they leave this earth before you
The impact hard hitting
And I do mean hard
I mean I felt it so deep it had me questioning god
Like why'd you take her from us?
Whats this really all about?
Do you really have a plan?
Looking up at him screaming
Screaming

[Hook]
