Its getting cold so im wearing winter socks fur in the closet
Ironic you see me with the fox

Im preying for it
Father lord i never follow the broke
They call me daddy and try to trap me i make em abort (adlive:uh huh)
Whats a young nigga to do

Maxwell sample:
I should be crying but I just can't let it show
I should be hoping but I can't stop i can't stop
All the things we should've said that I never said
All the things we should've done but we never did
