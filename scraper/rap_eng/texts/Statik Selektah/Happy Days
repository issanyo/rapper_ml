[Adlib - Mac Miller]
Finally got a reason to be happy, you feel me?

[Verse 1 - Mac Miller]
I never thought that I'd be doing what it is I'm doing now
Girls calling me, trying to follow me all the way to my house
In a city, then I'm out the next day
Still a young grasshopper, kick it with my sensei
Soldiers want to school me on the game, smoking and telling tales
"You can fabricate the truth, but being real never fails."
So I put my life on wax, as-is
Like right now I'm just kicking it up in Stat's crib
I'm kind of living the dream, and I enjoy it
Happiness is great when you're used to disappointment
Now I'm good, big smile and a loud heart
Everything kosher like Kyle off of South Park
Overnight success could be gone by the morning
That's why I'm on my grind, putting time in, recording
Stacking paper, trying to save me up a fortune
And go and cop a hundred pairs of old school Jordans

[Hook - Shawn Stockman]
When the rain fell from the sky
And the dark clouds made it hard to see the light
I still managed to survive
Now happy days are finally here and now I can, now I can smile

[Verse 2 - Termanology]
I rocked thirty countries in a two-year span
Damn, mama's little man rocking Japan!
Got the Source Unsigned Hype, showed the whole hood
And that was 2K5, damn time flies
Man it feel good to see people up on it
Coming to your shows and worshiping your performance
Running to the stores and purchasing your recordings
Remember your goal is platinum and gold
It's good to see Mac blow up, the kid's nasty
Statik on his way to the top, that's if you ask me
I've got a good reason to smile, I'm getting cash beyond
Whatever I thought I would make off a song
If I get a lot of money I'm leaving it to my daughters
It's a lot of fake people around me, but I ignore them
And I think about all of my enemies all the time
But fuck it, I'll let it slide, I'm just happy to be alive

[Hook]

[Bridge - Shawn Stockman]
When people turned their backs on me, played me, tried to throw me away
(Now I can smile)
Now they wonder how I'm still in the world, eating good and getting paid
(Now I can smile)
Cuz I know my children will never feel hunger pangs
When I wanted to give up, I found a new purpose, and now it's a new day
Cuz I'm so happy!

[Verse 3 - Bun B]
Look at my life and where your boy came from
The land of the trill, that's where I got my game from
Where you gotta be strong to survive
And if you're not built right, they gonna be gone with your life
Everything can change for you in the blink of an eyeball
Today they're your homies, but tomorrow they'll try y'all
You'll be the king on the throne, laughing at the pawn
And in a flash, it'll be your crown he's putting on
But I took the advice that the O.G.s bestowed
It didn't take long before your boy got throwed
Now I'm an O.G. and I'm doing the same
For the Terms and the Macs and the Stats of the game
Looking at my past days, and where I'm at now
I learned the skinny, now your boy's living fat now
I'm standing at the top of the pile
And all I can do is smile
Happy days

[Hook]
