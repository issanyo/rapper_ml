Hey yo Statik I’m feelin’ good!
Feel real good right now, you know?
I mean I ain’t expecting day’s to change overnight but
It just feel good, you know I woke up this morn’
I look at the newspaper I saw the new president
You know, him and his family, they look just like mine

[Verse 1: Torae]
I said the first time as a charm, the first time around
When I first recorded this song, guess I wasn’t wrong
Cause on November 4th, 2008
The first African-American president of United-States
Was elected, yes the campaign was hectic
Lost some good people on the way that’s expected
Gained a few million by the day that we stepped in
Grandpa and the victory speech was elected
Yes here’s our chance, y’all heard the man
So we roll to the polls thinking change—Yes we can!
Started as an organizer, with the senate of
Then he set his sights even higher to finish up
Nah we ain’t finished bruh!
But right here’s the beginning of straightening
The last eight they given us
And it’s just surreal cause for the first time in my life
Ain’t a mountain that I can’t climb
It was proven in that moment, that I’m destined to shine

[Verse 2: Jon Hope]
On the day of November 4th, 2004
Blissful, the 44th president was adorned
It’s the first black, half white
The world will react like
One voice, one troop
The future of a pastime
As I proceed, my eyes were glued to the tube
To vision closely
Most these critics would hate, the naysayers
Who’d say a couple of things about running with Bill Ayers
A red-ripe acorn, allegations were dead wrong
And I won’t even speak on my king
Cause that’s the next song
He inspires to get higher for mankind
Electorally the votes were won by a landslide
And that should be a sign of relief
Cause I can be anything that my mind could achieve
It’s the black, white, yellow and brown, it’s so logical
Cause Obama showed me anything is possible
We thank you Obama

[Verse 3: Sha Stimuli]
I hate to say it but I told you so
They wouldn’t give us reparations, I don’t praise the separation
But they saw the segregation, so we change the legislation
Put the rest to hating life
When Lincoln freed the slaves, I guess Barack’s up at the nation
But the underdog is sometimes the favourite
I relate (uh-huh), saw people at the polls wiping tears off they face (true)
I saw strippers on the poles that night celebrating
Taking lingerie off but couldn’t take a day off damn
She said “now I can tell my seeds
They don’t gotta rap or dance like me
They can be president it feels like a dream”
I threw her fifty dollars said “I know what you mean”
She asked if I needed change (uh-huh)
It’s kinda funny cause I said “we all need change
But keep the money I don’t know if one person can do it
Let me reverse that I’m stupid cause I change
With one verse from my music
I’m hurt and confused cause I don’t want to cry and grab a tissue
I want race not to be an issue! I almost wanted McCain to win
So we can riot, shoot our pistols, but I keep that feeling quiet
Deep inside I am officially hype, and I’m reminded why I picked up a mic
I didn’t wanna be a nigga for life but I loved NWA
I am not just a rapper when I babble ‘bout my travels I got something to say
November 4th it was one of those days
We recognize Martin Luther King’s dream was alive
Talk to me (Free at last! Free at last! Make all the money, we are free at last!)
