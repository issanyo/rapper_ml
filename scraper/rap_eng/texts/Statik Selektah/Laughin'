You ready?
100 Proof
Statik Selektah
Souls of Mischief
We started from the bottom, now we on top
Eh, from the bottom to the top, showoff
We laugh, we laugh
We started from the bottom

[Verse 1]
[Opio]
Let me ask you something
Do you feel as good as I do?
Would you be as fly if you knew what I knew?
I know a couple of yous “like I do too”
So for tonight you like my new crew

[Tajai]
You hoes be nice I might buy you a few
I’m cold, just like the vice down at Miami do
In a fly linen suit hide behind my limits
Laughing and bugging, dashing and loving

[Phesto]
Happy-go-lucky, ‘em rippers go dummy
Manifest OD and have to throw money
On the 16, running with a sixth team
I’m a hunter on the gunner M16

[A-Plus]
Ratatatata swiss cheese
On the come up for the summer
Banging a kitty, every city they miss me
Individually, get that million
I pristine, I mean the dollar bill yo

[Hook]
We coming from the bottom
You see that? We see that
To us it’s not a problem
Now we like: ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
We laugh, we laugh
You started from the bottom, now we on top
And we the ones who taught him
You see that? I see that
To us it’s not a problem
Now we like: ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
We laugh, we laugh
We started from the bottom, now we on top

[Verse 2]
[Opio]
I guess I gotta introduce you to the family
My advice is be the truest that you can be
Do you understand me? My crew is like a stampede
Do the damn thing I’m fluent with my hands/feet

[A-Plus]
Passing the zig-zag and twisting a fatty
In fact the big bag is half what we have see
I’m running when we smoke a lot
Got the open purple like
The north, the dot’s hot boxin’ in the parking lot

[Phesto]
Grew up off the caffeine, grew up off the granny strength
Shredded by the high school with a candy fool
With Statik at it, my dude got stat sheet
Man we run shit, polish your drag queens

[Tajai]
And you can not catch me
Fast as we mashing
Laugh by the land speed, champ’s left standing
Precision handling, look at that chassis
Master’s at crafting, classic and classy

[Hook]
We coming from the bottom
You see that? We see that
To us it’s not a problem
Now we like: ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
We laugh, we laugh
You started from the bottom, now we on top
And we the ones who taught him
You see that? I see that
To us it’s not a problem
Now we like: ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
We laugh, we laugh
We started from the bottom, now we on top

[Verse 3]
[A-Plus]
Opio’s funky, the loneliest monkey
And I be a like when I’m rolling amongst thieves
I don’t trust ‘em, they only know one thing: corruption
Just a mark baby it’s nothing

[Phesto]
Gut word bound off the cufflink
Cut deep on the cut laid with indelible ink
Me and my relatives a hell of a team you think?
Finesse in a delicate pink, intelligently man

[Tajai]
You tell ‘em, ain’t to be the fellas
As we develop machines and [? ?]
I’ve been top down, top bound, it ain’t no stop now
Show didn’t prove it, mould it or moved it

[Opio]
Roll something and smoked it
I know what to do with
Sippin’, smokin’ cigarettes up and uppin’ on some cool shit
Souls of Mischief on a mission ever lasting
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
We laugh!

[Hook]
We coming from the bottom
You see that? We see that
To us it’s not a problem
Now we like: ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
We laugh, we laugh
You started from the bottom, now we on top
And we the ones who taught him
You see that? I see that
To us it’s not a problem
Now we like: ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
We laugh, we laugh
We started from the bottom, now we on top
