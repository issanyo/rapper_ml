[Intro: Westside Gunn]
Statik Selektah
Ayo, fuck these niggas, Lord
Ayo, I don't give a fuck about none of these niggas

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, I'm nothing less than impeccable
Hanging out the car, [?] king, I let the Desert go
My VLONE, Ricky Kilos
Coaching my shooters like Rick Pitino, neck lit up like Reno (grr)
Seven days, ten bodies, that's a slow week
I don't wanna talk unless it's whole keys
Over scales I prayed, weighing a flake
Bought three phones this year, nigga, I'm straight
Courtside, Timberlake's on, across from Drake
Still a new nigga but I'm one of the greats
I motivate niggas who's starter was please get off 'em, I did
Jackboys' eyes all on my wrist
I'd rather catch a body than you taking my shit (boom boom boom boom boom)
Factual, live from the murder capital, king of an actual
Don't give a fuck, nigga, my time, they vaginal
This for my day one niggas eating mackerel
This for my niggas getting mail everyday
My niggas still dropping bodies, still heavy with yay
My main niggas been down, been fucked up since
So I'ma get up on this Statik and talk all of my shit

[Chorus: Scratches]
I'm out to get it, it's a stick up
All these motherfuckers been patiently waiting
I'm out to get it, Westside been had it locked, bitch
I'm out to get it, you feel something sweet, go get your heat and your peeps
If I embody bars on the street
Nigga, Westside

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, Flygod classic, Glock on me blast it
Last nigga that tried to rob me, turned to ashes
Black Waverunners, got the straps on the suede jumpers
Pina colada i8, the yay pumper
Audemar, Lord, fuck the time, my wrist a nigga house
Why [?] had to kill 'em, I had to figure out
I guess jealousy prevails
That's why I keep my third eye open on the scale
Why the nigga chain so big? Your neck frail
Used to lay up on the couch, reading wifey mail
I can tell, the hate getting stronger and stronger
You used to fuck with me, now my bread getting longer
Tryna compare me to the niggas I birthed
They only sell the vinyls, nigga, check out my worth
Be you, I'd rather jump off a bridge first
Carry a man? I'd rather carry my kids first

[Chorus: Scratches]
I'm out to get it, it's a stick up
All these motherfuckers been patiently waiting
I'm out to get it, Westside been had it locked, bitch
I'm out to get it, you feel something sweet, go get your heat and your peeps
If I embody bars on the street
Nigga, Westside

[Outro: Scratches]
Nigga, Westside
