[Intro: Orijin]

Good evening ladies and gentlemen
Glad you could join us

[Verse 1: Orijin]

I wanna hear classic beats played by master DJs
After they chopped it and screwed it
Who needs popular music
I’m clueless how rappers went from having radical visions to dumbing it down
So masses could listen
Trapped in a system of capitalism
But I wanna see things change rebels soldiers fighting against the king’s reign
Bring game strong like a bench press
Underground sounds stay down in the trenches
Pound with a clenched fist
Ready to burst they ellipse for the dirt they spit
Quick break out the first aid kit
Uneducated like some first grade kids
And yet they teaching the masses nonsensical content
The speakers are blasting
I’m frequently asking why we buying into it
Instead of tryna improve it or deny its influence
See poetry’s an art of arts
So why we ditching it with garbage bars
And either if I guard my ears I guard my heart

[Hook: Statik Selektah]

The thrill is gone
This stuff is pathetic
Please forget it
Your style is played out
The thrill is gone
Prepare for this rap killin’
Ri-Ri-Ri Right?
The thrill is gone
Let it go
Your style is played out
The thrill is gone
Ri-Ri-Ri Right?
Prepare for this rap killin’
Right?

[Verse 2: Orijin]

The thrill is gone the souls devoured
By the business
But we witness in a slowly generation like its solar powered
But for now we in the darkest and the coldest hour
Popular messages are subjected to control our cowards
And corporate owners
Some real sore personas
Prioritizing profit making tryna score a bonus
They just hungry for some dollars to stack
Label artists represented by the dots on the graph
If you fail to meet your quota you get tossed in the back
It’s problem a lot of artists got blocking their path
The infuse the pop and the rap
For optimum cash
Otherwise you at the bottom looking on for the glass
I’ve got a confident grasp for the role of an artiste
To spit wisdom to listeners in hopes that it’ll spark heat
In dark streets
Where despair is what they fail upon
When rappers force feeding it
It’s clear that the thrill is gone

[Hook: Statik Selektah]

The thrill is gone
This stuff is pathetic
Please forget it
Your style is played out
The thrill is gone
Prepare for this rap killin’
Ri-Ri-Ri Right?
The thrill is gone
Let it go
Your style is played out
The thrill is gone
Ri-Ri-Ri Right?
Prepare for this rap killin’
Right?


[Outro: Orijin]

That passion that real artistry
Emcees. singers, writers where you at
Share your gift
Breath life into this industry y’all
Let’s bring this music back to its purest form
Back to its orijin
