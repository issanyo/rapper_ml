[Intro: Anthony Fantano]
(Crowd repeatedly shouting: We don't wanna hear - no - no more Statik Kxng!)
Hip-hop has been around for decades...and you're saying that because I don't like a handful of albums that have come out in the past few years, I hate the entire genre? C'mon, son

[Interlude: KXNG Crooked & Statik Selektah]
Guess who's back
The KXNG!
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back

[Verse 1: KXNG Crooked]
Turned on the TV, the whole world fucked up
Turned the radio on, these party rappers turnt up
I wanna hear real shit, keep it fucking G
They scared to say trill shit, leave it up to me
I heard about your drug dealing and all your turf wars
But never about Dylann Roof walkin' through them church doors
Leaving 9 on the church floor
These new slaves scared to make waves I'm rapping on a surfboard
Kill him and I'll still kill Zimmerman
Then scratch him off the list like *scratch* (Ladies and gentlemen)
Kxng Crook, yeah it's him again, you know my sentiments
I don't give a fuck, that's why I signed to Eminem
Die slow, I hope your funeral is speedy
When your brains paint the wall like some beautiful graffiti
And if the cops come I'mma show 'em why they didn't make the last shotgun
When them bigots got one

[Hook]
I say some real shit cause I can
Aw, aw man, I just lost a fan
Aw, aw man, I just lost a fan
Aw, aw man, I just lost a fan

[Verse 2: KXNG Crooked]
And I don't give a damn
I know snakes gon' leave me when I'm in the jam
I know the cops wanna put me in a can
Free slave labor for a rich business man, yeah
We know about the industrial complex
Send your troops to scoop the new recruits from the projects
They'll be tearin' down my block next
Rebuild and raise the rent, so it's out of the reach of my mom's checks
She homeless and they don't give a fuck
Gentrification, they laughin' getting rich as Trump
Try to fight illegally and we be in a rut
Cause Lady Justice is a whore, yeah that bitch a slut
We screamin' we need help, she don't hear a sound
We pray for some hope, it ain't nowhere around
Dr. King taught peace, caught a pair of rounds
Molotov cocktail, yeah let's tear it down

[Hook]
I say some real shit cause I can
Aw, aw man, I just lost a fan
Aw, aw man, I just lost a fan
Aw, aw man, I just lost a fan

[Outro: KXNG Crooked]
Fuck 'em
