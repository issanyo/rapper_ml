Sunday was a fun day I spent with you
And although I feel the sky is fallin 'cause of you
Sunday was a fun day I spent with you
And although I feel the sky is fallin 'cause of you

Hip hop is everything I mean
Hip hop can be takes of soul music
Takes jazz music, takes blues music
And combines it into a new art form
And at the end of the day I'm just a fan
A fan of what?
Of music

What I'm saying you rappin or whatever
It just feels like you know
It's that soul just and that's , that's what matters
Before lyrics, I'm saying before lyrics and concept
The melody is just what comes out
Naturally like

Sunday was a fun day I spent with you
And although I feel the sky is fallin 'cause of you
Sunday was a fun day I spent with you
And although I feel the sky is fallin 'cause of you

Sunday was a fun day I spent with you
And although I feel the sky is fallin 'cause of you
Sunday was a fun day I spent with you
And although I feel the sky is fallin 'cause of you
