[Verse 1]
This landing's only temporary
We've connected alone
Departed back in February
But now we're closer to home

[Pre Hook]
Are we almost there? Yes I think we are
Time zones change but we know just who we are
Oh oh oh oh
It's time to go

[Verse 2]
Hey mom, I'm on the road again
Just wanna tell you that I love you like I always did
I'm sorry for late texts and all the calls I missed
It's hard to pay attention when all of my focus is
Gone - Just like my flight is
I'm trying to reach a level tall as Jordan's height is
Despite it, took all of your advice and started writing
Like that time you said there's always silver linings
Every plus has a minus, subtract then I times it
Remember all the times that you and dad fought?
It makes me cry quick
And dad I love you too - I've almost landed
When I touch down you know that I'mma get in touch with you
Just stay over, before I take off from this layover
It's like, yo, just stay over, before I take off from this layover

[Pre Hook]

[Post Hook]
How long? How long? Not long at all
How long? How long? Not long at all

[Jared's parents voicemail]
Hey Jar it's me just calling to see how everything is
Hope you're doing well, love you bye

Hey Jar it's me, uh, I haven't heard from you and just wondering if you got there, ok?
So call me let me know you're there ok? I love you
