[Chorus: Jared Evan]
So turn your light on whenever the light's gone
Now that the night's gone just leave me the light on
Just leave the light on we'll do it all night long
Until it goes away

[Verse 1: Jared Evan]
Just save the light for when I get home
I know it's hard to wait but it's worth it
So we can make it shine when the light's down
Don't turn the light off 'cause it's perfect
And you don't have to lose the sun
You can spend the day and night
If everything is feeling good
We can burn it oh so bright

[Verse 2: Jared Evan]
Ye we grind hard when we get it on

We be sweating she don't stop so the switch is on
Let's make the night long so we can make this life long
Cause when I come home I say she always sees the lights on

[Chorus: Jared Evan]
So turn your light on whenever the light's gone
Now that the night's gone just leave me the light on
Just leave the light on we'll do it all night long
'Til it goes away

[Verse 3: Termanology]
She got her a night gown ready to lay down
But she still hoping I come through and lay it down
So I pull up in the drop with my ice on
She like a nosey cop always got the lights on
And I'm the one she like when the night's long
'Cause I give a good conversation and the pipe's strong
Make the night light take when I'm hills click
I know your man hurts you I can make you heal quick
You feel this? this is real dick
Stronger than a steel brick , super long real thick
She love it when I hit her with my jewelry on
We can make a movie on my new phone Louie Vuitton
Love it I'ma leave it and whip it's hit and quit
Sometimes I stay for the night but that's a hit and miss
Bugging when I turn off my phone, with an ice grill
But when I show up she ain't worried about the light bill

[Chorus: Jared Evan] x2
So turn your light on whenever the light's gone
Now that the night's gone just leave me the light on
Just leave the light on we'll do it all night long
'Til it goes away
