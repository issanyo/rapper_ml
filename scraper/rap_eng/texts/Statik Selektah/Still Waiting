[Sample]:
Am I up all alone?
I'm still hear waiting

[Verse One]:
Ayo
I'm still waitin' for Mrs. Right to hit my life
I'm still waitin' for piff and white to flip tonight
I'm still waitin' to work with Doc Dre and Kanye
I'm still waitin' for my day
I'm still waitin' to parlay with hella loot
I'm still waitin' till my moms livin' better too
Cause my life's still raw
I'm 20 somethin' years old and I'm still poor
Dawg, I'm still waitin' for my props
Cause they be hatin' on my me in my hood nonstop
(Nonstop)
I'm still waitin' to go pop
That was just a joke but picture me on top
(On top)
I'm still waitin' for the cheddar
The 2012 Benz with plush leather
I'm still waitin' for a hit record
I know it's not far but I'm tryin' to be a star
So I guess I gotta rap sub par
Cause they ain't feelin' you when your bars are like Ra-
Kim, Jadakiss, M.O.P, and Nas
They'd rather have you rap about the girls and the cars
So I guess I should go and get a job
Baggin' up groceries or workin' at the mall
Or maybe I should go and just rob
All these big willie cats comin' out the bar
I'm still waitin' for justice in America
To many cats locked in custody for barely crumbs
And my life wasn't really fun
Growin' up with no lunch meat in my sandwich son
Grippin' on my gun handles son
Listen to Jay, listen to Roots, listen to Em and Pun
And the rest of the cats that inspire my raps
Still waitin' on the trap to buy me a 'Lac
Still waitin' for me and Stat to make a mill
Fuck it, let's make a bill
The music we make is Ill
-Matic
Cop a bottle and just break the seal
Let a little pour for our peoples who ain't here
Still waitin' for my crown and my chair
Martin Luther King here
Malcolm X and J-Dilla
In my dreams
Your boy all up in Heaven
Chillin' with Bernie Mack and I ain't tryin' to come back
