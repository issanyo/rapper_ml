[Termanology:]

The mayor chilling at the bar taking shots with us
Spanish food, red rice, fried octopus
Feds taking pictures watching through binoculars
Bunch of automatic weapons with the cop killers
The governor in the mix with the pawns
With that stripper Yvonne and that Christian Louboutin
I got everything on me, I’m talking any amount:

[All you need. . .]

Yup yup, I got it, been
Hooked on chronic since hooked on phonics
I’m a new breed, grown from a new seed
Hydroponic robotic demonic super MC
Supercalifragilistic piff
Alphabet boys with warrants to take prints
Damn. I wish I had a spaceship
Even the Lord told me:

[All you need. . .]

Is to raise up out of here
The streets only gonna give you grays or a lotta years
Me? I’m starting to show my age when I volunteer
To cut somebody off, the team getting smaller every year
Yeah. Sipping bottles in the mirror
Tears down my cheek, wish I could bottle every tear
Wish I could stop my mama’s tears, like “Mom, here”:

[All you need. . .]

I’m watching videos on Worldstar
Rappers making it rain while half of the world starve
Me, I’m just stripping these rhymes, writing these real bars
Still up in the hood; when I’m not, sometimes I feel odd
Who said your album sound real hard?
WWW dot FAILBLOG
Dot com that’s right
Try giving up the mic, that’s

[All you need. . .]

I can’t take it any more
There’s no big tiggers in the basement anymore
There’s no more skills whole place spitting bars
Just a juvie and a cause. Damn
No more creativity
The ability to raise the bar lyrically
Comparing me, mentally, I’m a top ten MC:

[Right now. . .]
