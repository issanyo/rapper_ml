"How far must you go to gain respect, ummm" - A Tribe Called Quest 'Show Business'

[Verse One]:
Before the internet intervened and the sales we expected to see overseas
And the states and the regions we locked in a previous time
We believe you can shine and exceed if you rhyme with a team
And a rhyme and a beat that was fly on the scene you was liable to see
And account full of G's that amount to the cheese
You could count on the streets in a drought with them keys
And they spit with a passion, a mission of rappin' was gettin' it lastin'
No Cris' in the glass and no spittin' a rachet, a fistful of cash
And now it's in a casket, I miss it, what happened?
It's cold but it changed to a whole 'nother lane where the pros are the lames
And the songs are the same and the labels are wack
Cause we make all the tracks and they cake off of that
I wish we could go back

[Verse Two]:
This record here might never get play
(Why?)
Cause they won't make cheddar that way
(Ahh)
Radio ain't stretchin' my way
(Nah)
Shit man it's prolly better that way
(Ha)
So what about the club?
What about the club?
They don't play the shit real hood cats love
They ain't tryin' to see the east coast come back
Now they snap and lean and do all-a-dat
So what's hip hop?
I don't know man
I guess it's whatever the DJ's program
Who in charge of that? Not the DJ
He play whatever the list say he play
So what you sayin' is that he ain't a DJ
He's just doin' his job, that what he say
Well I ain't mad at that, he just tryin' to get his bread
I guess Nas was right, yo Hip Hops Dead

[Verse Three]:
Yeah, wax turn into MP3s now
Youtube is the MTV now
Internet is the new magazines now
Everybody wanna be an MC's now
Robots is the new DJ's now
Ain't nobody playin' what they wanna play now
Everybody up on Myspace now
Tryin' to lay their game down
Tryin' to get a name now
