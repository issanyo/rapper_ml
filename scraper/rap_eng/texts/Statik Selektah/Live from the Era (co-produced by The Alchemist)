I got one lit and she say she with it
I grab the dutch and I split it
Legs open, nigga I hit it
Damn right, the bitch won't forget it
Wake up in the morning that bitch deaded
But you shameless
Rolling joints with your hoes trying fuck someone that's famous
But we know how the game is
Don't hate me I'm just a nigga that's playing
Don't mean to bring up old shit home girl but I'm just saying
You love the fast life
Got all that weed, got all that white
Got all that purp, got all that Sprite make you feel like
Someone important or somethin', bills past due
You here frontin' but she Louised up girl you stuntin'
She fresh to death cause we showing up
On my dick cause we blowing up
They notice us, same hoes that showing up
Get my ?jack and? then blow it up
Used to get rejected when I texted
Now these hoes is counting what I'm projected
Number one in the draft, counting cash, going hard
Fuck a cab bitch, I got you on a Metro card

"And would you please welcome to our stage"

It's like bitches get addicted to this dick
Too many ladies trying to have the baby off of this kid
I'm not kidding, tell by the way ya'll wrap it up
Sometimes fact is fuck it, the notes until the glasses bust
While you acting tough you like a fucked up shellfish
Hard on the outside but you soft in the skeleton
Somebody gonna have to help him from the spanking, the belts thin
By then, I'll crack another nut, by the time the elephant
My L stem, my doobie's thick, yeah
She got a nice square but her bootie ain't shit
We exchange looks I already took
80 kush to honor roll when she showed me what she learned from books
Look, I don't play around with people's children
I could sell these niggas blanks
How they tell me they don't feel 'em?
Feel me? You supposed to
You must think you fly in that coach booth don't you?
Then come and let me coach you
Fuck old dude, he's old news, old in the shoes
And I'm old enough so tell me how old is you?
She said, "Old enough to know the rules"
After we screwed then we through, come here, let me show and prove

Trying to find the twelve jewels of life
Champagne nice, shots on moi, an eye sore I seen in plain sight
I'm too literal, cloud highest bidder
Waging wars in your area, we breaking sound barriers
Light bearer, how I'm supposed to feel on a million
Sacred geometry coming from the first millennium
For the millionth time I'm on the road to fame
How I'm supposed to be tame?
A black boy days of chronicles of 'caine
The old man's pain from a fast life of gain
One shot desert eagle man, I'm shooting for dreams
I got to make it my reality, better yet my salary
Them haters' response is "How sad are we?"
Thank you, thank you, far too kind

"Please welcome to our stage"

Can't describe the accuracy that I pack with me
Leave these half-MCs feeling like after I rhyme they stuck with half of me
Release the facts release with fast relief
These cats can't scratch the canal-deep lines
That make these word pronunciations flow like average seas
The average seeds could never see how to paddle me
Cause once I demonstrate the way to regulate, levels raise demographically
Gradually aim to graduate before my first grand estates
Cause once you eating steaks, iy seems like snakes gonna want to wrap a plate
So they know it's the steaks on my plates for being one favored
It's simple when you progress with the steps of an elevator
Then I elevate your mind state so when you state yours
Even a day tour could not keep up with how my state talk

"And will you please welcome to our stage"

The wild fuck 'em, duck 'em, never love 'em, I bust a nut for fun then
Now they frontin', say they stuntin' but never all for nothing
Like shorty why you bluffing? My heart cold when I rush in
So don't be making assumptions, I take pride in my crushing
Some chicks saying they want me, they show it when they taunt me
But if she hot as hell, I know they gone demote me
Never catching me slippin', I slip in between her thighs
And looking from a distance I bet you gone see me shine
They said if it wasn't for rapping you won't be here bragging
Fuck your feelings, they should happen, I been here forever macking
Disposing mad chicks, I grab their asses
Pass it to the Pro with the assets, just get yo' ass in

"And will you please welcome to our stage"

They represent, I gotta gift my rap presents, what's not to get?
It was reset but in this style, allow my head, I represent
Won't understand what the method is, remember this
Alexis sexting, sexing using estrogen
So let's listen, don't need a loss
Throwing that meat, don't catch a fit
The price I pay for your attention used for sublime messages
A sticky situation, you and I could make a mess of jizz
Then cha-ching, throw it around and we on the brink so
This magnum on me got me feeling like it's army
The sticky got me feeling clingy to a wallet, I'm thinking stop
I stuck up a Brinks truck, call my bank corrupt
Tell 'em they foul for trying to file for bankruptcy
Until they handcuff me, this music can't be released
It was a crime, they can't be freed
Killing it, this track's deceased
Rappers don't have to be in order to clash with beef
Not being greedy or need when they ask for the piece
Nah mean?
