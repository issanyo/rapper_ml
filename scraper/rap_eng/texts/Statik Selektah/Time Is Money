[Hook:]
Eyo, It's my time to get it Sonny
Reminiscing on times that we was hungry
But this time is for the money
Yeah, cause you know that time is money right?
Yeah, cause you know that time is money right?

[Verse 1:]
The long-awaited on a path, not at all related
To the one that I walk by, that my momma hated
When I had a son incarcerated
Didn't see me become another statistic cause my father skated beyond elated
She can see how far I made it, behind bars not a world of the bars created
Bring it to life the the [?] that I contemplated
Taking my spot, can nobody confiscate it
Now who's the best [?], I'll let y'all debate it
But mention my name, won't none of y'all negate it
Until my crib is enormous and my yard is gated
I keep them food for thought, hoping y'all had ate it
I [?] with Big Nas and Jay
Call it what you want I preserve the Cocho while y'all degraded
I'd be dead for my son, and my daughter naked
But life has two options, you start with taking and Im'ma take it

[Hook:]

[Break:]
Time is money, I ain't wasting either
I ain't running around try'na chase these diva's
Might get a little face from [?] when they face eyes skied up

[Verse 2:]
I'm off try'na make my G's
Ain't no time for me to place my feet up
You  know my little sis need some plates to eat up
Go ahead and blaze your weed up
And inhale strong until it takes you to that place need to be
Come on this ride while I lace this beat up
Give you nothing but truth ain't no fake to feed ya
MC's I see through that fake demeanor
Couldn't walk in my shoes, couldn't lace my sneakers
Easy flow, unbelievable we needin' dough
Ain't nobody making peace and I
Got a good look at these facial features
Soon it's gon be one of the greats you see at the top of this
