[Intro: Saigon]
I wrote all them raps cause I was in jail with nothing to do, my nigga.  Now that I got things to do, writing raps is like last of my priority list.  Statik, Yardfather.  This is the difference between me and them

[Verse 1: Saigon]
Check
New New Gitty is back in full effect
We the kind that don't throw gang signs or claim sets
We one of the few left that ain't riding the west
Ain't dick sucking the south
You still'll get punched in ya mouth
You ever fuck around, luck buck 'em down (buck 'em down)
I like the way that sound, luck buck 'em down (buck 'em down)
I'm bucking the fuck out of this duck knuckle now
I uppercut the sucker, the fucker gon' touch the ground
Since two thou, I came with another style
My shit was "sharp-then" just like brother Al
But I was never rocking a perm
If I was, anything I try to teach, the people not gonna learn
I could try to take the popular term
Rap about a bunch of bullshit that's not really not my concern
Or I could do some old dumb shit that come with a melody
Nigga, I know the game, what the fuck is you telling me?
I love this hip hop shit, nigga, you smelling me?
How else could a nigga get rich with two felonies

[[Hook: Sample]
I know you really wanna know who's
Comin' through, leaving bloodstains and residues
Got to pay your dues, baby, you know the rules
Who's that, yuuuuuu
I know you really wanna know who's
Comin' through, leaving bloodstains and residues
Got to pay your dues, baby, you know the rules
Who's that, yuuuuuu

[Verse 2: Saigon]
Statik, these flows of niggas is wack man
Y'all niggas flows is dookie
I flip styles like one of them old Suzuki's and Sho Kosugi
Burnin' whoever closest to me and verbalize meat that ya'll eat
Laying back on the concrete
Rip open your chest and rhyme to ya heartbeat
Niggas can't resist to put the bond first
If I am what I eat, then I guess that I'm every wack lyricist on earth
Born worse, couldn't really explain in a song verse
Ask the families of the people I put in that long hearse
'09, we flipping this into some other different shit
Real niggas, come get your certificates if you interested
First off, we gon' build this Abandoned Nation censorship
Prison don't even mention it
If you ain't experience it, this is some serious shit
Go 'head, think of playing this
See what you saying when it's a puddle of blood you laying in
You kidding me?  I'm literally the epitome of verbal validity
Look, nigga, see what life did to me
Turned me colder than my older raps, colder than polar caps
Cold as the common cold, perhaps, without no look back
I used to cook crack, they took that
I learned to jux cats,  where the Brook at?
We got this shit locked, put that back
And new Giddy is back in full effect
Fuck around you, gon' get my hands wrapped around ya neck
Respect to all the kids that's still trapped in the 'jects, I'ma rep
Watch how much of this cash I'ma collect
Yep!
