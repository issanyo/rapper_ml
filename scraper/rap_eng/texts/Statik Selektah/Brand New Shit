[Intro:]
Uh, its aight man, yeah
We can do that smooth shit every now and then, Statik, its good, playboy, yeah
I'm on this Jameson right now, double shots straight up
Let me tell you about this chick though

[Hook:]
She wants diamonds and furs
Rollies, his and hers
Gator Hermes thirty thousand on a purse
Twirl around the world with her problems in reverse
Cause she put her old life in a hearse
And baby on some brand new shit
All she want is brand new shit
I take her on a brand new trip
I gave her all this brand new dick
Baby on some brand new shit
All she want is brand new shit
I take her on a brand new trip
I gave her all this brand new dick

[Verse 1:]
Cause baby on some brand new shit
She see the big pic
For drama she ain't got the time
She got a new contract in life
And just like where you sign
She focus on the bottom line
I was sitting in my coupe, Hollywood sunset sunny day
When she happened to come my way
Pretty face, skinny waist, bubble ass, I'm just saying grade A
Spoke to her right away, we hit it off but I really couldn't stay
I say
Ay, I'm on my way to the Beverly Center
But I'd like to invite you to seventy dinners, uh
Conversation sharp, she's smarter than a Jeopardy winner
And got the spirit of a true boss, heavenly in her
I peeled off thinking fuck, she's so thick its a shame
Maybe I should pull a Joe Budden and put this chick in the game
But shit got different the more I start to pick in her brain
Sapiosexual, down to stick my dick in her brain
Found out she grew up in the projects
Niggas around the complex
Treated her as an object, for hot sex, was odd next
Then she said don't take that out of context
Sweetie, those little boys don't even know the concept of mind sex
Besides, it ain't birds eye, its third eye view
That let me see the light inside you, they never tried to
Now every day, she think about Crook
And like these rappers fashion, she got a new outlook

[Hook:]
She wants diamonds and furs
Rollies, his and hers
Gator Hermes, thirty thousand on a purse
Twirl around the world with her problems in reverse
Cause she put her old life in a hearse
And baby on some brand new shit
All she want is brand new shit
I take her on a brand new trip
I gave her all this brand new dick
Baby on some brand new shit
All she want is brand new shit
I take her on a brand new trip
I gave her all this brand new dick
