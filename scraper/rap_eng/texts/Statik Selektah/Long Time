[Intro]
(Another)
Shit got me creeping ‘round the block, yeah

[Hook]
From the bar to the penthouse, shit done changed
I’m a pro, I ain’t playing in no pick up games
You want your paper and I want mine on time
It’s funny, I’ve only been doing this shit since ‘09
That’s not a long time (another, another)
That’s not a long time
That’s not a long time

[Verse 1]
It starts off being for the love then it changes
Shaking hands with strangers, hopping in and out of Rangers
Arrangements with spa treatments in the Caymans
Soufflé served fresh out the oven, look amazing
Addiction to the finer things in life
No more Sizzler, no more Golden Corral
Even though Body loves that shit, it’s beneath us
Gum under my sneakers
I just came off tour, bought my mom a new knee
It’s a new day, motherfucker meet the new me
I’m so ahead of the game I’m playing 3K in a Kufi
You still acting like a groupie

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Roll out of bed to cold marble floors in the summer
I need my bank account like a German phone number
Call Klaus, I want the Porsche loaded
Shit look like it’s doing aerobics, all white like Maury Povich
I wasn’t given this, I chose this
I’m eating well so I’m looking bloated
I’m on the plane, but I could have floated, uh
You know I’m golden, just like the hair on Hulk Hogan
The pure oil makes me cough like when the doctor checks my nuts for cancer
Hop in a Lancer like a dancer, I’m the answer
The many different questions Russian scientists don’t even know
I guess that you ain’t need to know

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yo, I’mma smoke what I wanna smoke
Drink what I wanna drink
Buttnaked in the Cherokee
You know I’m high ‘til they bury me
I’m staying high ‘til they bury me
Yo, I’mma smoke what I wanna smoke
Drink what I wanna drink
Buttnaked in the Cherokee
I’m staying high ‘til they bury me
Too high to die ‘til they bury me
(It's not a long time)
(Another, another)
(It's not a long time)
(It's not a long time)
(It's not a long time)
(Another, another)
