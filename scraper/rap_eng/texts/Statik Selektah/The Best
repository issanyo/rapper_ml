[Verse One] [Statik Selektah]:
The best
And that's word to my momma
2010 ain't no more drama
Word to Obama, a new day dawnin'
I wake up to make beats every mornin'
Head bangin' from last night
Still got jet lag from that last flight
Still got bloody knuckles from that last fight
And we the best in the world, that's right

[Reks]:
ShowOff
We most official, win it when we pen it
We tendin' to kill 'em with it
The lyric will spill if ain't best in the world
Never timid, never shy
Seventh hour with the best of my
Iller lyrics why try
Contestin', been a minute, I'm in it to win it
I'm a be lieutenant
My spittin' are realer image
Y'all lie, y'all die
Y'all cry faggotty, Raggedy Ann rappers be lackin'
In the back of seats tryin' to steer
Horror here, time to fear
Kali, JFK, Termanology, R.E.K.S. beyond y'all
Blah blah, Statik is a don y'all
Hangover like an encore y'all don't want war
Y'all bitch, y'all snitch, y'all just
Rob jars take pennies
My niggas, can we just make dope shit
So sick, like Manny
Homie on the juice, Corey in the booth
Family
Pass the deuce deuce and the Henny
And can we

[Termanology]:
Well I'm Termanology I got bitches galore
You might have a lot of bitches but I got much more
With my super duper group comin' out this year
ShowOff motherfuckers, cold knockin' the boots
Reks, JFK, Term, Kali and all of us
You don't wanna spar with us
Lyrically you get swallowed up
Give them ? and rock, come spit a bar with us
Punk we spit phenomenal, uh meet us at the top

[JFK]:
From Stick 2 The Script to Spell My Name Right
Yeah, we that same clique, come too game tight
We sacrifice your head, to spit classic shit
Keepin' the show live, until the casket dips
We worldwide
Around the world in a day
Continue to flood the streets
Take over the airwaves
It's Politics As Usual, Hangover is here
Who you know is six albums deep in the last three years?

[Kali]:
Too many cups of Henny
Not enough weed
Too many fuckin' pennies
But not enough G's
To many late nights, bright lights, Cali trees
Too many rappers, not enough MCs
Too many actors in the place but I'm established
So we just keep our distance
Like a bad marriage
There's no comparison cause they average
This is magic, way beyond classic
Do you cause we gon' keep doin' us
Nobody can ruin us, tell 'em stop pursin' us
They'll never catch us, we're way beyond pass gone
They jottin' down all the lyrics from my last song
Put your hands up
I know I make it hard to breathe
We tear the club down I know we make it hard to leave

Cause we the best in the world
