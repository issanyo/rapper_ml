Chorus
Are we almost there yet yeah, are we almost there yet?
Are we almost there yet oh oh oh oh, Are we almost there yet oh, are we almost there yet?
Are we almost there yet oh oh oh oh

Verse 1
I've been trying to live out all my dreams, when will they come to life oh
They seem so vivid when I go to sleep, when I wake up they call on me, oh yeah yeah yea
Said I been traveling far, but I'll make it there,
I been there from the start, life ain't always fair.
I'll never fear the road down, if I could make it here I'll make it anywhere.

Chorus
Are we almost there yet yeah, are we almost there yet?
Are we almost there yet oh oh oh oh, Are we almost there yet oh, are we almost there yet?
Are we almost there yet oh oh oh oh

Verse 2
Yo, life's a kaleidoscope chopped with a lot of hope I sit and rhyme when I think about my obstacles
Hey mom look at me now the kid is on the rise and he's making you proud,
I got a half a million dollars at the age of twenty two, I thought my life was set, I guess it wasn't true
But now I'm twenty three trying to make it back to school but I never graduated so they calling me a fool,
Yeah I'm turning bronze to a lot of gold, I'm feeling like Lebron when he got a gold
Statik play the record so they hear what I say, I'm from New York but I'm headed west no Kanye
With a back pack if my fans talk then I chat back and I bogart like the rat pack
No I won't stop till I'm that cat, I'm no one they could compare yet, but I still ask myself are we almost there yet?

Chorus (x2)
Are we almost there yet yeah, are we almost there yet?
Are we almost there yet oh oh oh oh, Are we almost there yet oh, are we almost there yet?
Are we almost there yet oh oh oh oh

Are we almost there yet yeah, are we almost there yet?
Are we almost there yet oh oh oh oh, Are we almost there yet oh, are we almost there yet?
Are we almost there yet oh oh oh oh
