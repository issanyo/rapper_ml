[Intro] [Sample of Dave Chappelle]:
"I’m one of those people that are so smart that I’m uncomfortable in this world. And I’m scared to live. I’m not scared to live, but its scary out here, God Damn. I know how flimsy this shit is, I can see through the...it's not good. Shit is real."

"Pray for me, I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully" - Jay-Z 'D'Evils'

[Verse One]:
Check
I'm writin' this with ether in the lungs
A burner is still pointed at the brain
Cause these rappers still killin' the game
Holy Moses and Jesus, upon my knees I plead to you again
Send 'em all to Lucifer's flames
Sorry momma, but fuck Obama
I ain't really seein' no change
The hope is gone focus on the pain
Of Guru gone
Read the letter, fuck your letter, Solar is to blame
I hope somebody pop your shit with hollow tips
Sorry, it's too obvious that nigga is a counterfeit
Think of classic, Keith Elam, nothing you do count for shit
Bitch made, please swallow a switch blade
Dig grave, take a dive and Reks I'm back ridin'
All the talk of Waka Flaka pop up and I'm still hatin' his name
Gucci this, Pras that, why rap?
Won't bring back the revolution, Chuck D's evolution
Fuck these niggas, nigga Biggie Small's king
Y'all can't fit the crown, put it down
I'mma put it down for the underground
Cause the sound still reign
I am Kane, Kool G, line up these lames so we
Can aim Uzi but now when we blow they skulls, Tarantino movie
Doogie or Dougie, your dance ugly Jerk
These tight jeans should've come with skirts
Or matchin' purse
Fuckin' verse after verse
Make it rain, see my chain, see my whip, see my bitch
Middle finger, eat a dick
Till these niggas sing my shit
I'mma take aim at all I'm your dawg for that real shit mayne
For that skill for trill for that ill
Fuck with me, fuck with Gibbs, fuck with Pill
Wanna kill Limbaugh and Kill Bill
Ayo the South, y'all killin' rap still
So's the east and the west, north lost in this mess
For the 'Pac in my chest next time until
I'll be the Drama like Gangsta Grillz
Chill with the tough talk still
Hip hop's aging
I'm at it's side
Tryin' to aid through the ride
