[Intro] [Statik Selektah talking]:
The year was '82. Lawrence Massachusetts. Same year as the Air Force Ones. Wild Style. Michael Jackson's Thriller. It was a good year. You know, seeing that we grew up off that Gang Starr, Pete Rock & CL Smooth, Kool G Rap and Polo. I think hip hop needs a new duo. Ayo Term, you ready?

[Verse] [Termanology]:
Ayo, it's Term and Statik
Collapsin' radio speaker sets
We lacin' these reefer heads with lyrics and beats to sniff
It's Guru and Preme and 'em
CL, Pete and 'em
In the future, the truth is we took our steez from them
A little mixture, extreme lyrics and bangin' beats
