[Intro]
Oh you lit

[Hook]
Never could be too lit
Never could be too rich
My bitch never could be too thick (yeah)
Never could be too
Never could be too lit (aye)
Never could be too rich
My bitch never could be too thick

[Verse 1]
I know my angels got my back, but it's demons all in front of me
A halo for a hat, I wear the crown always underneath
The king to a God, tryna guard all this energy
That's why I stay strapped - in my dungarees
Looking at the past, thinking everything is done to me
Moving so fast I can't let the future run from me
One foot upon the gas, the other foot up in my enemy's ass
I'm just tryna make my legacy last, it's everlasting
You never passing a nigga's passion
They on their last stretch like they're elastic
I'm Mr. Fantastic, everything I drop, another classic
They only mad cause I got it mastered
Anything that I imagined, I made it happen
Turn the pen into a wand and I make magic
I'm good with the words but I'm better at the actions
I'm putting in the work, man I'm never relaxing my nigga

[Hook]
Never could be too lit
Never could be too rich
My bitch never could be too thick
Never could be too
Never could be too lit (aye)
Never could be too rich
My bitch never could be too thick

[Verse 2]
And you don't understand my angle
Getting tangled in, all kind of stars, it's spangled
Feeling like I'm dangling over a edge
Playing tango with the Devil trying not to break a leg
I'm just tryna break bread with my brother man
Rather see us niggas dead, you don't understand
Middle fingers to the feds and the government
I'm taking shots to the head like Osama Bin
Iâ€™m wilin' man, they rather see me talking 'bout my wallet and
How I got the girls going crazy at the colleges
She give me good brain and I might just pay her scholarship
Pussy intuition, baby get up on this knowledge and swallow it
I penetrate deep like a hollow tip
You can ride the mic baby girl we can politic
The money, man I'm piling it
I'm profound at this
Never I profile with it, my whole style legit

[Hook]
Never could be too lit
Never could be too rich
My bitch never could be too thick, (yeah)
Never could be too
Never could be too lit (yeah)
Never could be too rich (aye)
My bitch never could be too thick (yeah)

[Interlude]
That's right, yeah that's right, that's right (yeah)
Never could be too lit
Tell America to suck my dick
Never could be too [?]
Never could be too

[Verse 3]
Who want spar with the demi-god, demi-god
Feeling like I'm Thor for the denims on, special clothes
Talk and got attached to the emerald
A vessel of a force, to be with you in the epilogue
It's another episode, written from the upper echelon
Hidden in another rapper lungs, should I carry on tradition
As a Barry Bond division
Through the windows of my soul, ain't no medical prescription
I'm on a mission, keep an eye out for opposition
Niggas tryna sneak him, that's for his rap position
But they better off just quitting
Got bars like they guards hitting in San Quentin
And I'm sicker than the judges with the sentencing
I sense tension
Viewers discretion, will be advised anytime that he arrive
They caught the vibe way before I step inside
I walk with the light, see the spark in my eyes

[Elis Regina]
Sentindo o frio em minha alma
Te convidei...

[Hook]
Never could be too lit
Never could be too rich
My bitch never could be too thick
Never could be too
Never could be too lit (aye)
Never could be too rich
My bitch never gonna be too thick
