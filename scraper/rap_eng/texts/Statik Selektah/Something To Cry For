[Verse 1: Boldy James]
Remember my first case, was facing a 3 to 9
Was thinking at worst case scenario plead the five
My second and third case, was looking at 25
I should’ve played first base cause I can’t let niggas slide
To second and third base, who switch it and pick a side
Cause niggas done turned stayed as a witness and testified
Showed up in my court dates and couldn’t look me in my eyes
Was in for a short stay, but I was stuck in the bank
Got caught in the wrong place, they wouldn’t give me a bomb
Was sick with a long face cause now I’m looking at time
Fighting an old case sitting in cell 9
With no clocks on the wall, you couldn’t even tell time
Watching hours pass in an infinite hour glass
Through my bulletproof window pane visit from moms, cut to the chase
But before my mother sat I caught a lucky break

Tell him to fix his face before

[Hook: Boldy James]
I give you something to cry for, the joke’s on you, jack
We not laughing with you, we laughing at you
I guess I’m one of them oddballs that slipped right through the cracks
By the skin of my teeth, accidental
And then I took down your high score and put my name on the map
With a half a brick and a pack of Skittles
Getting this money to die for, the joke’s on you, jack
We not laughing with you, we laughing at you
I give you something to cry for
I give you something to cry for
I give you something to cry for

[Verse 2: Boldy James]
I got one in the slide for her
Them niggas caught in their feelings, the fuck is you crying for?
Them niggas you see me with is niggas I ride for
Over this concrete and shit niggas done died for
To my peoples in the pen being in time portals
It’s either you do the bid or you let the time warp you
Or get the fuck out the street cause this shit is not for you
It’s death before dishonesty cause niggas is not loyal
Especially in the D where bodies get rot spoiled
And get put six feet deep under the top soil
Where niggas’ll cop from you then put their Glocks on you
And then in the same breath quick to call the cops on you
My hood is a lava lamp if they get to drop on you
They throw you the total opposite of a house warming
Surprise, nigga
Let this 40. Cal on my waist, wipe the smile of your face
