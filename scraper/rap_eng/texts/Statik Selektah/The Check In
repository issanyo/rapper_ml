[Intro: Jay Lonzo & Slick Rick]
Statik Selektah
We good?
As we go a little something like-
Yeah
Some-some-something like
Can you turn the beat up a little bit?
Go a little something like-
As we go a little something-
Go a little something like-
Some-something like this
Uh

[Verse 1]
They say I'm quiet, I just died the lies
I ain't shout out to myself, I just be private with pride
I see this [?] wait no, that's just the [?]
Competition seepin' through the system, I'm the culprit, right?
Figures, but figures always figure themselves
Until they makin' figures sneakin' figures into hotels
The greatest far from grace
Fire on you [?]
To have the greatest fall from grace you gotta be a great first, huh
Open the minds with one line at a time
I thought it'd happen overnight, forgot we frozen in time
They hate my generation, I hate them callin' me a throwback
Started in 2012, ran with the belt like I'm Novak
I'm still the youngest, still the dopest, and they know that
I think that's why my rhythm's good, I'm working on my toe tap
They tried to tell me I was working with this window
That 16 was the limit and after that, chances dim low
That 17 was pushin' it, now my career in limbo
I never answer back this question, where they got this info?
I put out 17 and had my father on the intro
So people in my DM's jackin' all the album lingo
I like it, I'm elevatin' still, but they say since I'm 18
It's over, pack up my bags, let go of fake dreams
Envy is real, envy is real, envy is real
Bring up a bacon, egg, and cheese to tell Envy the deal
Yeah

[Chorus: Slick Rick (Sampled)]
Go a little something-
Go a little something like-
As we go a little something-
Something like this
As we go a little something-
Go a little something like-
As we go a little something-
Something like this

[Verse 2]
I'm checkin' in, that's what we do where I'm from
Shout out the number one supporters 'cause they knew where I'm from
And all this [?] foreign language, sure that's new where I'm from
And I see people lose they life for wearing blue where I'm from, huh
It's been a while, I guess that's always the case
I need reminders why I'm here, I'm always lost in the race
Now I've been watching Jason Whitlock, now I'm lost in the race
And talking down will get you mourned so now I'm lost in this space
I love the competition
And people say that, but I know it
Since the competition normally is people that was closest to you
I wish 'em luck though, they gon' need it for me
And I don't trust nobody word unless I see it to be
I'm seeing everybody rap now, and everyone's a witness to it
Social media made a monster and there's a business to it
The corporate gangsters used to try to kill our minds
Then, they realized over time, give us money as the riches to it
The videos used to be about the love
Showing people that we unified, they said, "If it has bitches in it"
And if you battle addiction then they gon' blast that
Slam it in the camera, they laughin', they thinkin', "This'll do it"
They like, "We stupid, we been thinkin' too much. All this time we tried to kill 'em, we should watch him, let these niggas do it"
It ain't just them, we gotta [?]
We hear our homie makin' music and we ampin' his pen, for what?
He sound like every other rookie, you should tell him that
When SoundCloud on the dope, but now I'm sellin' that
And better yet, this ain't even me reachin' my peak
This is just a sneak peek, warmin' up the heat seek
'Cause I see the weak speak and the people retweet
So it's time to clear my notepad and let this heat speak, uh
Some people need this, I'd be selfish if I kept it in
So I just give 'em what they want and then I rest again
My timin' couldn't be better, I'm 'bout to hit the road
My time is here, this is feathers, I'm in a different mode
Y'all thought the album was enough for this year
But the day that I dropped the album, I was writin' this here
You see, I'm falling back, kickin' it with Statik then I go off
I don't even speak, I just show out and show off
Yeah
I just show out and show out and show off

[Outro: Jay Lonzo & Slick Rick]
Go a little something-
Go a little something like-
New York City
As we go a little something-
Brooklyn
Something like this
The 718, step up in the buildin'
As we go a little something-
Go a little something like-
As we go a little something-
Something like this
