[Intro: Smoke DZA]
You're gifted with the power
Turn water into wine
Too long
Get a hundred thousand dollar dimes
You get the point
Statik Selektah

[Chorus: Smoke DZA]
How many puffs does it take to turn a joint into a roach clip?
How many pulls does it take to see the bottom of a whole zip?
How many puffs does it take to turn a joint into a roach clip?
How many L’s does it take to see the bottom of a bag?

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Set a nigga out, I need that potency that flow with me
That OMG, that where the fuck you get that shit from?
Dawg, I need that O-O.G. , not potpourri, come smoke with me
Get fourth degree burns on your motherfucking lungs
She asking 'bout a million questions, got curbed last round
[?]
Blowing loud every time I'm in the club
Niggas running down asking for a dub
Sipping some Avian, low as [?]
[?] and my clothes smell like cheeba
Reefer wrapping raw, seek the benefits for sure
Got this quarter piece by law, my feet'll never touch the floor
Kushed God, they like you on something
Yeah, big clouds like the storm's coming
Too chinky-eyed for me to see
I tryna match up with the boy, you end up fucking up your re-up

[Chorus: Smoke DZA]
How many puffs does it take to turn a joint into a roach clip?
How many pulls does it take to see the bottom of a whole zip?
How many puffs does it take to turn a joint into a roach clip?
How many L’s does it take to see the bottom of a bag?

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]
She ask me do I love her, I said girl you must be tripping
You ain't Mary Jane, I love her more than anything
Only bitch that bad enough for me to buy a wedding ring
Only bitch that had me pussy whipped and that's on everything
Only girl that held me down when I wasn't working much
Bad enough to hang my jersey up
And can I get an amen, word up
She don't know how bad I need her, [?] Roddy's murderous
Jack boys, [?] boys, and burglars
Slick side crazy shit, forever my lady
It's always fuck you, pay me, when you born in the 80's
She always in my corner, met her right on the corner
I even spent my last dime tryna cop another quarter
A pro with the reefer, smoke a nigga to a coma
My homie tried to warn me, be careful 'cause she will harm ya
Her shit was so good she made a nigga double back
Then a couple years later she made my lungs collapse, damn

[Chorus: Smoke DZA]
How many puffs does it take to turn a joint into a roach clip?
How many pulls does it take to see the bottom of a whole zip?
How many puffs does it take to turn a joint into a roach clip?
How many L’s does it take to see the bottom of a bag?

[Verse 3: Trademark da Skydiver]
Yeah, O.G. smoking O.G., smelling like an oz
Pump that gas low key, all the potheads know me
Drop the ticket if you find something bigger than a QP
Certified loud pack, [?] strong, Bruce Lee
My young hoe smoke the pressure till her eyes look Chinese
My cougar like to smoke it out the hookah, she might OD
My main bitch been on her Mary Jane shit since '03
And I ain't been the same since I smoke my first lb
SV only smoke the best trees
In a session with me you better bring your best weed
Uh, I'm on hydro like a jet ski, my nigga
[?] like E.T. with moon rocks in my swisher
Sour D on a beach with my hippy bitch and
Light is flicking like they taking paparazzi pictures
All they wanna know is how many puffs does it take
To reach the bottom of the L, I can't remember

[Chorus: Smoke DZA]
How many puffs does it take to turn a joint into a roach clip?
How many pulls does it take to see the bottom of a whole zip?
How many puffs does it take to turn a joint into a roach clip?
How many L’s does it take to see the bottom of a bag?

[Outro]
