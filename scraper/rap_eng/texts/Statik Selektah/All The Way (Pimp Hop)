[Hook: CharlieRED]
If you gon' go, darling, go all the way
I wanna see
Listen, baby
If you gon' go, darling, go all the way
I just wanna see, baby

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Step right in, come on down see you's a bad girl
And I'mma put you on your knees then your back girl
I burn you out, I flip you out, I turn you out
And show you 'bout some freaky shit that you ain't never knew about
Yes sir, you know I heard all about you
I'm here to re-route you, need to see what that mouth do
Virgin-a-listic, imperialistic
I got a t-shirt full of your lipstick
Go down, boo, go ahead and kiss it
I'm about to explode don't you miss it
A whole mouth full, don't be scared and don't be bashful
One more question that I must ask you
Do you like or love it when I smash you?
Bring your girlfriends cause you have to
Now go away and get it, now bring it right back, boo
Go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wais P]
Platform Persians, Panamera swervin'
See a fly bitch, had a Porsche, U-turnin'
Dropping off, picking off, baby, get my digits up
Buy her a Birkin now maybe you can visit her
About to finish her, you fucking free her
I pick her up, switch her to a Benz from a Kia
And I don't need her, I put money before divas
That's how I'm rocking fur, somebody run tell PETA
Who cares? New Airs, Louie loafs for the public
What I rap about I really got, look and judge it
I'm like the Jim Morrison without the chorus in
Type of cat to drink til I black, wake up and pour again
It's war again, Benz 550's what we touring in
If you gon' go then hit the [pole?] and pour it in
It ain't a chore again, it should be natural
Factual, it's like if your money slow, I slap you, ho

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ransom]
I'm pimping without the limp, what's the pasta without the shrimp?
What's the chopper without the inf, never pop up without my mink
It's waist lift, most y'all niggas is straight simps
And I don't deal with change unless it's gon' make sense
I'm finessing this grey Bent and I ain't gotta drive it
A million in wardrobe and I ain't got a closet
And we flying private, first class even
Thirst cash season, first class heathens
I'm a violent pimp, I slap til my palm hurt
All you see is some blood, a track and a Converse
A long hearse if you skimming of the top
I'm big pimping like Hov with women on the yacht
Ten linen on the [?], rims spinning on the drop
A hundred on the band, hand spinning on the watch
Clam dinners on the spot, Castellano
Mano e mano, take ten paces, let off a hollow

[Hook]
