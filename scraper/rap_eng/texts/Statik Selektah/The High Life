[Hook - Kali]
I know what you been waitin' for, that new shit
You ain't gotta wait no more
I put it down doesn't matter what place I go
I'm smokin' good shit
I'm drinkin' Exodo
I just wanna live the high life
If I don't smoke before I take off
I don't fly right, uh
I'm just tryna get my mind right
So fall back
I'm just tryna live my life

[Verse 1 - Kali]
My vision's blurry, but don't worry I can see you clear
On my way to NYC I'll bring you back a souvenir
Sneaker head, everyday I wear a different pair
Flows like water, I should walk around with fishing gear
I'm showin' off, show money, we just blow it off
On the road to success haters wanna throw me off
But I ain't fuckin' wit' 'em, I don't know where they be at
Dirty ass chlamydia bitches just wanna get me clapped
Fuckin' rap music turn me to a monster
Jumpin' into mosh pits about to Freddie Foxxx ya
Punch you in yo face if yo ain't comin' at me proper
Smokin' like a rasta, bangin' like a shotta
Chain hangin' low, breath smellin' like vodka
Tommy gun flow, lifestyle of a mobster
Offer, they say I'm outta my mind
Call me 'Daylight Savings' I'm ahead of my time
I said

[Hook - Kali]
I know what you been waitin' for, that new shit
You ain't gotta wait no more
I put it down doesn't matter what place I go
I'm smokin' good shit

If I don't smoke before I take off
I don't fly right, uh
I'm just tryna get my mind right
So fall back
I'm just tryna live my life

[Verse 2 - GameBoi]
Consider this my formal introduction
I'm roamin' tusslin' for the mind body spirit
To get my soul to function
I'm so disgustin' yo girl is blushin'
She said she in a rush for me to blow her muffin
I'm chillin' slowly puffin'
A zig zag of a letter Z
Alphabetically, I'm John Lennon on the track
I just "Let it Be"
Especially never getting too sentimentally
Fifteen years young, got thirty years ahead of me
Tryna get that warranty, ya know my sound'll blow your decks
And holdin' techs, my lyrics'll (shoot you) B-B-B-B-Boba Fett
Youngest spitta of Michigan who can flow the best
Everything happens for a reason livin' with no regrets
If you tryna follow my trail, you gots to get yo weight up
And you can't borrow my scale, yeah
Me and Webby on the gold like green lights
From steep heights, me and Statik out, no three strikes

[Hook - Kali]
I know what you been waitin' for, that new shit
You ain't gotta wait no more
I put it down doesn't matter what place I go
I'm smokin' good shit
I'm drinkin' Exodo
I just wanna live the high life
If I don't smoke before I take off
I don't fly right, uh
I'm just tryna get my mind right
So fall back
I'm just tryna live my life

[Verse 3 - Chris Webby]
It's the rap head honcho, Philly to Toronto
Sharper than a blade that was made by Hattori Hanzo
Theremin couldn't hurt him 'cus my flowin' is phenomenal
Webby half animal leave 'em up in the hospital
Achievin' the impossible, flowin' colder than popsicles
But heat it up in the booth until the climate is tropical
Einstein intelligence, Webster is always smart with words
I got some screws loose, need a better carpenter
Electrify 'em with a Raichu shock
Me and Statik in the fast lane, fly through blocks
Lose a battle is one thing that I do not
I could kill 'em with less words than a haiku got
White man can't jump, so I'm climbin' to the top
This is real Hip Hop fuck a diamonds and your watch
Spit flames 'til the point that you'll perspire on the spot
Honestly there's no denyin' that it's hot muthafucka
