Oh babe (Statik Selektah) Oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah
(Dj Scratches)
Ladies and gentlemen, and now to the stage
Live from New York, here we go

[Verse 1]
You could take, all of your shit and just pack up what you brought
Cause there ain't room anymore, I can't keep your baggage for sure, (you)
You could fake, you're not in love but we both know that you are
But you won't stay for long, cause I can't keep your baggage no more, oh oh oh

[Chorus]
You claim that you don't know
But there's no doubt about it
You never leave home without it oh oh no

You're better off on your own
Ain't no way around it, it's not the way we found it oh oh no

[Verse 2]
You could be, as bitter as you want
About how things are
I told you straight from the start, I can't keep your baggage for sure
Uh, yeah
Can't believe, that I would actually
Give you what you want oh oh
Cause there ain't room anymore, I can't keep your baggage no more oh oh oh

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Michael Christmas]
(Laughs)
She high fashioned, low maintenance, no patience, hate waiting
Stay in Vegas, hate to bake shit, love debatin she be praying
Call me Satan, love to stay in (Booo)
Told me get your shit out, then she called her cousin damn I think she put a hit out
Wish I had a team, I could probably sell the bitch out
Thinking I be dreaming get behind her then I pinch (Ouh)
Said girl what happened? They be kicking flavor in your ear Craig Mackin
Too many games like back to back and
Sitting in my underpants that's the captain
Morgan endorsing, Love Michael Kors, don't believe in divorcing, hate doing chores
Think I'm Blake Griffin say I'm dunking all the whores
I say why you crazy, who done fucked up all your doors?
Said you call on top row, tell em he could come get your shit
And then I called up your phone, just to tell you I miss you
