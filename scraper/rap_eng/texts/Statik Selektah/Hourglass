''HOURGLASS''




CHORUS-

Days is like sand trickling through my hands
Only through the mind can we expand
Life is a hourglass plumetting fast
What your life about
Getting this cash

-------------------

While y'all leave paper trails, i and federals
Catch moet chills hot wit the glizzy and digi scale
Far from fairytale just bands for bail
Back on the strip bussing liqs, before grams go stale
Shouts to chicks happy wit some dick
Some money for hair and nails
How else would we maneuver through mail
Switching rentals playing 12 like vinyl
Dark caesar manicure you know how i do
Jeep no roof Palm angel track suit
Had streeks jackin before ever rapping
Trapped in the final stage
If i'm Wrong don't judge
Just knowledge me the page
Mar got the whole city now caught in the daze
On the deegan switching lanes
One in the  head till i'm dead eyes blood shot red
With restless schemes
Until currency flow like H2O through ravines

---------------


CHORUS-

Days is like sand trickling through my hands
Only through the mind can we expand
Life is a hourglass plumetting fast
What your life about
Getting this cash

Verse two


I made yen off yang
Some cash off bang
She want a ring
But the streets dun already took my name
Making mar five star
Valet out front q-50 tented up
Playing herbo sour burning up
Optics sanguine seat recline mind traveling
Faster then rumors around the vatican
I be mackin with options
Uptown baddys blowing hookah smoke
At cha broke boys gossip
Breaking plates playing the field
Emerald eyes on richard milles
From baggys to air seals
Suzuki two wheels
Pop a rosey when i feel
Blacks told me in 2014
We ain't signing no deals
Era of independence
VVs'S dirty dancing like micheal jackson
Make ya gang tuck they shit in
Silent love im shouting
From newark to bear mountain chea

CHORUS-

Days is like sand trickling through my hands
Only through the mind can we expand
Life is a hourglass plumetting fast
What your life about
Getting this cash
