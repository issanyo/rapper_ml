[Intro: Goddy Boi & Jet 2]
(Goddy Boi)
Turn me up
(Jet 2)
I got you
(Goddy Boi)
Yeah, Goddy, Jet 2
(Jet 2)
We in the car recording this by the way

[Hook: Goddy Boi]
I seen mami from a distance
And she had me in amaze
She had me in a maze and she had me in amazement
I seen mami from a distance
And she had me in amazement
Her long hair and booty had a nigga in a amazement

[Verse 1: Goddy Boi]
I said her name is Asia
Got her phone number, but she fuckin' with a pager
And I seen her homegirl, her name is Deja
Man she had ass all up in them pants
I didn't even know which one to choose
But I didn't wanna be rude, so I'll take you
Not Asia or Deja, the girl listening to this song
I wanna get you in your bra and your fuckin' thong
I seen mami and I got her name
Took her to the crib, man and I got her aim
And I was wearing skinny jeans like Cold Flamez
Next I beat the pussy, made it cum and came
And Goddy make it rain literally
I make it rain on her collar like a mutha fuckin' chain
She was screaming auto-tune like T-Pain
Man I'm so on fire, you can call me propane
Yeah, and I sucked her like fangs
Man she taste good like lemon pepper wings
And I beat the pussy up and made it just pop
Made the pussy fly something like Wing Stop

[Hook: Jet 2]
I seen mami from a distance
And she had me in amaze
I seen mami from a distance, she had me in amazement
I seen mami from a distance
And she had me in amazement
I seen mami from a distance, she had me in amazement

[Verse 2: Jet 2]
And shawty was about the most b-e-a-utiful
Girl, kinda what a niggie make the music for
5'6", nice lips bright skin with
The kind of sex appeal to make a nigga sin quick
Lord, forgive a niggie emotions
But I'm trying to get her up in my video phone
Ice her whole body out and eat it like Cold Stones
Hit her with the speed stick and make her pussy roll on
Gone. Bye baby, so long
I connect it in her tummy make it feel like four phones
Steroid workout, cause the sex is so strong
Make her have a little baby Jet 2, no clone
And I'm fresher than cool-mint
Eat the pussy out, clean it with a tooth pick
She got me feeling real intact
And my tongue game sharper than a thumbtack
Her shit dumb fat, make me feel dumb trapped
Inside it when I slide in like a gun strap
I mean a gun clip. Click clack
And if she let me see the clit then I'mma lick that
Yum, bubble gum, baby I'm kidding though
Ain't trying to be disrespectful, you're just so irresistible
You lookin' like you fell up out of heaven, what a miracle
I'm saying you can make Soulja Boy feel lyrical
