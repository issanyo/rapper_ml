[Intro: KXNG Crooked]
Yeah
Yo shoutouts to my nigga Chris Wills on Twitter (what up?)
My man ordered multiple copies of Statik KXNG and that was a statement, you know
We appreciate that shit

[Hook: KXNG Crooked]
Ha cha cha cha cha, that’s my long nose
Keep it on the low, a secret under my clothes
But I don’t want no problems, no no, no no
I got my mind on my dough, and maybe a couple hoes
Aye

[Verse: KXNG Crooked]
A cha cha cha cha
Long nose 44, ha ha ha ha ha
Raging bull Taurus placing paid in full forward
While I’m rocking my gold chain like la da da da da
This that February 12th flow, it’s good for your health though
I don’t see my haters, them niggas must be in stealth mode
Statik on the eastside, Crooked on the Westside
You know it’s the best vibe, it’s time to let the shell snow
Selektah make the speakers crack, homie, we on the sneak attack
I need a track like this to inspire me to bring the Weeklies back
Necrophiliac, fuck your dead career
This graffiti rap, when I sketch, you hear pictures I bet your ears won’t forget for years
Competition man, don’t make me laugh
I just slay ‘em like Gabrielle Union slays Stacey Dash crazy ass
I never hate on rappers making cash
But even though their advance is hefty, they be trash (garbage)
This for my niggas who slaying that Jane Fonda
You run off on the plug, we come creep in that plain Honda
‘Cause this avenger shoots well kinda lke Iguodala
Mixed with that nigga T’Challa from Wakanda
I promise I’ma bang llamas, outline you in white chalk
Boy, it’s like the Hollywood Walk of Fame
I can leave you famous on that sidewalk
Yeah, everybody’s gon’ know your name
Leave me alone, a nigga just want his own now
I freestyle on IG like fuck putting a song out
PS, if your GPS
Got you travelling towards me with your BS
Nigga you went the wrong route, that’s when you gassed up and got to stop
Thinking that I walk in your spot and I only brought a Glock
.44 Magnum in public, the nose is so long
When I tuck it, it got me walking like Oswald Cobblepot
Ha cha cha cha cha, you ain’t fucking with the icon
Told you I strike quick as a python
When the mic’s on, I make the competition fade to black
Like David Blatt had to do in lieu of Tyronn
My god

[Hook]

[Outro: KXNG Crooked]
Ha cha cha cha cha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha, yeah
February 12th
Statik KXNG will be in stores
Go get that, man
Let’s get the motherfucking pre-orders jumping, yeah
If you fuck with real hip-hop
And I hate the terminology “real hip-hop”
But if you fuck with that raw shit
February 12th
Word
Ayo Aktive, let’s get the fuck out of here, man
Let’s get the fuck out of here Aktive, hold up
When that long nose is tucked
Remember, you got to say ha cha cha cha cha
