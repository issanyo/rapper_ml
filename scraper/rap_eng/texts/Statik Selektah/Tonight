[Intro]
Is this what it is?

[Verse One: Slaine]
This is supposed to be love
I’m falling, losing my strength, you wasn’t holding me up
I’m feeling ice in my veins, this life has frozen me fuck
I had this mic and this pain, my fight it rose me up
Rose me above, I’ve risen this high, I refuse to give in or die
You abandoned me, you living a lie
You acted like you fucking loved me, you were willing to ride
I thought that loyalty was the light that was filling my sky
That was tough to accept mostly cause I didn’t know why
I went to war with everything, they tried to kill him inside
But something snapped, if I gotta be a villain that’s fine
I’m unbeatable I told you for the millionth time
I’ve been in hundreds of fights, probably lost a bunch
But I never ran from one once, never walked from a punch
Don’t say hello when we pass, we don’t talk on the phone
You might see me in the future but I’m not coming home tonight

[Hook: Cyrus Deshield]
What don’t kill me only makes me stronger
All this emptiness inside feeds my hunger
So tonight tonight it’s on it’s on
Tonight tonight I won’t fade away
Tonight tonight it’s on it’s on
Tonight tonight I won’t fade away

[Verse Two: Slaine]
This jealousy is hard to accept now that I’ve made it
I’ve been betrayed and hated, it’s the monster I created
If I believe in something best believe I’m gonna say the shit
When I die what I stood for I gotta lay with it
Ain’t nobody making me or breaking me you cocksuckers only mistaking me
Awaken me from complacency and now I’m pacing impatiently
Holding my rage inside my ribcage, stay the fuck away from me
I ain’t scared of the next life, I’m prepared when it gets trife
Destroyed by my own dad, I was left by my ex-wife
Watched dozens of young friends meeting their deaths right
I was there when my aunt ODed on those steps like
I put her on my shoulder, jumped into a cab
When she came to she punched and kicked me, she was mad
I guess my whole life misunderstood, I’ve been so sad
The only thing I have is this pencil and this pad tonight

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Slaine]
So tonight I’m back where I belong, I’m back where I’m from
I’ve got my back and my front and here back with my gun
I’m back walking through this fire and the gutter my son
I’ve accepted my calling Lord, I know what I’ve become
My skin’s thicker, my pen’s sicker, my mind’s made up
I’ve been a poet and binge drinker from the 9th grade up
I’ve witnessed some things beyond vicious bitches with wings
I’m the fallen angel, the chosen, written scriptures of kings
I’m the everyman, the legend, they bestowed me with that
And hated me for it but nowadays they hold me to that
To the music I’m a slave till I go to my grave
I’m the freedom fighter, the writer in a cold-blooded haze tonight

[Hook]
