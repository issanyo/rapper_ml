For the people.. For the people..
For the people.. Who the fuck you think we making this for?
For the people.. For the people..
For the people.. Who the fuck you think we making this for?

[Verse 1: Just Juice]
I said we made this for the people who plotting to reach a dream
Taught to scheme for the profit and often that means the cream
Cropping the greed, cream of the crop, copping the C.R.E.A.M
Opting to rein supreme, popping scotch up in the limousine
After the cash that any budget wouldn't budge it
Foes sludge, I'm fluid, my only threat's my hubris
Juice been fit to make it, now haters having tantrums?
After the crown and some, crowds chanting my anthems
First track, they're throwing their hands up for the album
Rapping rhythm for income, lavish living's the outcome
How come I'm ousting them, still they tryna denounce him?
Opposition splitting in the middle like they Malcolm
Coming up out of Massachussetts
Masses of music from my crew is coming through the sweep the masses like a broomstick
Ros√© in the chalice, foreign babes in the palace
That's one day, for now it's pen-to-pad until my fingers callous

For the people.. For the people..
For the people.. Who the fuck you think we making this for?
For the people.. For the people..
For the people.. Who the fuck you think we making this for?

[Verse 2: Just Juice]
I said I made this for the people who chasing the fat stacks
Paper will never make me, I'll make it and pay it back
After I lay a track, the immaculate Statik backing it
Packed to the max with the action fanatics will label classic
Platinum plaque-ing, my stats meaner than average
Lyrical since a day old, miracles' been my payroll
Nevertheless, the best with the pen is attacking centerfold
Maxing at the top of your ladder and any pedestal
Who the fuck you think we making this for?
I'm coming, gunning for the day we make a break in the mold
Aching to blow like A. Pacino, play the game, casino
Toking (token) like quarter rolls, and dimes attracted, Magneto
My people, know, to me, they come before the Green like Cee Lo
Me and my people equal from the prequel to the sequel
Bigalow is the name, Just Juice is the alter-ego
Aiming to be the greatest, I'm making this for the people

For the people.. For the people..
For the people.. Who the fuck you think we making this for?
For the people.. For the people..
For the people.. Who the fuck you think we making this for?
