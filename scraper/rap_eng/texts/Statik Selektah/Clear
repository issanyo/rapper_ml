[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh, cold bottles, hot nights
Long stories, short flights
My turf be your territory, everybody got a price
Indecent proposal, the money to have people at your disposal
Bitch wake up to a nose full and sneak out on old dude
He been on to her moves but he play it cool
Knowing better than to trust a bitch
Even though she was with him
Back when he began hustling, had her tugging greyhound
Bussing all types of other shit
Know how that old game, loop a younger bitch
Same thing, lose a younger bitch
Speed kills and them newer cats is mad quick
Survival of the fittest, niggas need to join a gym
Rhymes lightweight homie, been lifting
International audio dope distributing
Five star restaurant with my house shoes on
Light the joint of a don, stay out my way from here on

[Hook x2: Curren$y]
Real nigga, let me make it as clear as my windows
If it ain't about no paper we can't deal with ya'
If you hating we can find some ways to deal with ya'

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
You're a thug but you be around the stars, mad nervous
You ain't got enough bars, bad service
No reception
You claim to be real, that's your perception
It ain't all skill, it's all perfection
I'm the best and, let me make that as clear as my windows
Deeper than rap, niggas know I handle my business
'Fore the trial even start, I handle the witness
Either way, niggas gon' get it
From sunshine 'til the storm hit it
I'm out here, hands on with it
I don't love the money, I just get along with it
Turn soft white into hard dough
Bad bitch on a jet watching Argo
That's what it call for, we can all go
I'm just making it clear so that you all know
Nigga
