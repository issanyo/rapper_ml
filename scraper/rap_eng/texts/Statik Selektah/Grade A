[Intro]

9th wonder on the beat
'ology
Who you know nicer than term?

[Verse 1]

Don't call me Term bitch
Call me the Tokyo traveler
Ring rattler
Microphone fiend, spleen splatterer
Queen Challenger, automatic with three silencers
These talents and this weed is high caliber
Then i shoot 'em down, down
Bang bang
Said i put 'em in the ground, ground
Far as we concerned, we gon' put 'em with the worms or
Make your baby mama sniff the ashes out your urn
Let the whole team smash, pass and take turns
Let the whole thing blast, no flashing that's for her, I'm
Sick with the word play, nice with the blah blah
Since i used to move bricks of baby powder
Back on the scene like i'm reading a script
Driving through my block slow like my seed in a whip
What's the meaning of this rap shit? The meaning is this:
Money, hoes, cash, clothes, good weed and a fifth, you know?

[Hook]

Who you know nicer than term- Termanology?
Who you know nicer than term- Termanology?

[Verse 2]

Yo, what's today's mathematics?
Show them the automatic
Get your heart splattered on park av
In front of the cameras
Leave 'em coughing up blood
And his pockets like rabbit ears
Give me a stick that i can live on for a half a year
Give me a chick that loves to fuck, suck and swallow
A fifth filled up with hallows and hennessey by the bottle
Got the whole world sitting right dead on my shoulders
I'm opening up doors like a gentleman s'pose to
The whole team shining and we rep for the culture
Different city, different club, looking fresh on a poster
Really I get love where you never should go to
Without that moose killer on deck in a holster
Got the champagne spilling all over these hoes
Moving white in that wet, call it rain in the snow
Try not to get me upset, I'll aim at your skull
And put your brains on the floor where your laces should go
Bang

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

I'm the reason hip-hop sound hot this year
Sound anything like Term? Then sign right here
Only difference is, y'all can't duplicate what's original
When y'all lack the chemicals in the brain, that's physical
You can't change it, it's genetically habitual
It's a ritual for me to expose the bitch in you
Every syllable's pivotal, audio or visual
Ken is in the coup cause the cardio is killing him
It's easier than stage ID lifted than weeded up
The media think they know you cause of your wikipedia
Typical, don't make me hook off of you for principle
Fingerprints is stuck together for more than medicinal
Man, i keep it G till the day that i die
I'm 730 like the last day in July
Listen, you want beef i'll put the K in your eye
Term and 9th, we're the reason rap's staying alive
You know?
