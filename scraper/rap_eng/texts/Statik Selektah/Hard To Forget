[Hook]:
Its hard to forget you, but
Hard to forget you, but, goodbye

[Verse One]:
Remember me? I was the one you used to call
When you needed a pound or you needed a ball
Man I had it all, it used to be fun
When you took it off the bag, put it on your gum
I used to put it on the bag, sell it to the slums
Made a lot of ones, drama it will come
Got me in some trouble, man I stuck around
Cause you was the best friend that I had in town
Had a lot of friends, where are they now?
Roaches when the lights went out, look how they bounce
Shit was extra real, made a lot of loot
Lot of fake soldiers, lot of phoney troops
When the law came in, how they ran away
Put a big black cloud on my rainy day
I know its hard to neglect ya and disrespect ya but
I had to forget you

[Hook]:
It's hard to forget you, but
Hard to forget you, but, goodbye
It's hard to forget you, but
Hard to forget you, but, goodbye

[Verse Two]:
My loyalty it seems its destroying me
Friends getting me into shit, my blood boiling
Open up the newspaper look at my face
Another chase, another high profile case
If I fronted you a packing and you never paid me back just know
I aint forget it, but you just deaded your credit
Not a chicken wing, not a French fry, not a piece of gum
Not even a pull of a mid grey reefer blunt
Sorry for being blunt but I can't stand a snake
Just another hand to shake
Ike Turner, Annie Mae
This betrayal to me is getting way old
All them favors y'all ask, and I ain't never say no
And I ain't tryna act like I'm sitting here with a halo
But I ain't never snaked nobody over no pesos
What goes around comes around and around again
Tell her friend, never piss in the wind

[Hook]:
It's hard to forget you, but
Hard to forget you, but, goodbye
It's hard to forget you, but
Hard to forget you, but, goodbye

[Verse Three]:
We was once two brothers of the same kind
Quick to holler at a shawty with the same line
Who would know you would get my man state time?
Don't even try to explain homie, I hate lies
Thought we was blood brothers, boys to the graves
Now I see you on the streets and I don't even wave
Cant believe you sent my little brother to the cage
And to think I used to let you chill upon the stage
Times change but it's sad when your friends do
And plans somehow don't come out how you meant to
Cause he your friend he supposed to drive a Benz too
But now he resent you, cause he struggling when the rents due
Life changes in a flash so I never get gassed
I keep it real with my friends from the past
And a lot of cats out there, I wanna call your name out
But out of respect, I choose to forget

[Hook]:
It's hard to forget you, but
Hard to forget you, but, goodbye
It's hard to forget you, but
Hard to forget you, but, goodbye
