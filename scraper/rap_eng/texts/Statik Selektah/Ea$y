[Intro]
That's why I'm easy
(What's going on people?)
I'm easy
(Hopefully everything is fantastic in your life
(That's why I'm easy)
And if it's not, this right here's the remedy
(That's why I'm easy like Sunday morning)
This shit right here's the motive of nearly everybody
Easy money, fix your agenda, open your schedule for this right here!

(I want to be high, so high)
So high!
(I want to be free to know the things I do are right)
Show off! You can't spell destroy without the S.T
True indeed!
Come on!

[Verse]
This is the money and we about to set it off like
This is the result of feeling hopeless, living reckless
And you pouring all of them emotions on your records
I was so focused just to get this
That I even broke up with my exes
I hope they can respect this
They loving how I spit that
But I've got a gift to rap
You couldn't gift wrap
You wonder how'd I get that?
The good Lord blessed me with the talent to present you
I've got to use it to its full potential
And if I don't do that
I'm doing Him a disservice
This is my calling, you corny rappers get nervous

They say it's time for me to come in the game
Leave the hammers alone, your voices is one and the same homie
You spit slugs that'll murder these rappers
The words in these raps verbally capture
The vivid image of the hood, let it reflect
The guns, drugs, money, all the murders and detects
We bring in the real because rap addicts are bored
I show off naturally, I pour Statik a Port
Salute my brother Term and my S.T
Score show off homie, this is the dynasty
Primetime, no time, to chill you're in
Times you're trying to feed two children
I need some dollars quick
These lyrics and melodies need to bring a scholarship
For Lyric and Melody
My baby boy and girl
Just know daddy adore you, and every time I'm gone know that it is for you
I'm chasing my dream that I'ma instill in you as well
They tell you that you can't do it?
You send them to hell
You brush them off, and you keep it moving
Through God anything is possible, just keep pursuing
And if ever you fall, just keep getting up
Because the only failure
Is giving up
Love is love

[Outro]
That's why I'm easy
Easy like Sunday morning
I want to be free to know the things I do are right
I want to be free, so high
I want to be free to know the things I do are right
I want to be free
