[Reks-Verse 1]
I wanna travel the world
Lace my wife with the diamonds and pearls
My mom with a crib
So she can live in peace she deserves
Give my son Zeke everything I missed as a youth
So every time I get in the booth
I rap with a focus
Rats and the roaches
No more of that
More like plaques and awards
It’s the new prognosis
Ride or die ? always said you the dopest
And I know this so I’m aiming at the game like coaches
Pain had us hopeless
No more living broke like as hobos
We building like Legos the logos
Show-o-double ff (showoff)
Reppin’ M-A-double S (Mass) like a Malolm X out of jail photo
By any means necessary
Green’s the itinerary
Lawtown scene and the dream’s to be rich, you ready?
Well live it up, fill the cup, make a toast
All my niggas know that victory’s close
Held your head if ya…

[Hook]
Big dreamers, we all seem to be big dreamers
Wanted it all, oh we wanted it all
Cause, we big dreamers
When me and my homies were small we kept our eyes on the mall
Big dreamin’ til my rims spin
And my swag right
Cause my gear fresh
And mom’s got a crib of her own
Shit I’m grown, so I’m gonna keep big dreamin’ I got gots to get it

[Termanology Verse 2]
It’s all-scientific
Mystic, you know the earth and the stars
Don’t hesitate to say heard of the law
We the boys from the north
When Krumb put me on, I was under 21 with a gun in my palm
But that was way back
Wishin I had a starter jacket
In the part of Bradford Street where the crack heads were on the corner clappin’
Before the I-Tunes, I was high-noon
With my Ice-Cube tape bangin’ at the loudest vol-ume
Had to defend mine, without seeing Fed-time
Member when I told my momma, I ‘ma make it big time
That’s when I made up my mind, I was big dreamer
Aim for the sky, label guys gonna feed us
Caviar and such, now we on the bus
Perion and cuffs?
Cali in the dutch
We on a world tour
I’m so proud of myself, I seen the big picture
IMAX theatre, ology, I was a big dreamer

[Hook]

[Krumbsnatcha-Verse 3]
The million dollar man, call him K-Dibiase
OT the ice man, a rap’s Liberace
Frost bit, three hundred thou for some car shit
Still underground, get the hoodies for the mosh pit
That’s just a dream now, but it’s like a part of me
Escape mental poverty, now its like monopoly
On my mind constantly
Out for the property
? Money and vision is missing properly
And I’m a work til the good lord bury me
Give back to charity, manifest prosperity
And nothing change when there’s money to burn
Just be stunnas with the young gunnas Reks and Term
It started from a dream on the corner just rapping
But now we hard to find like Osama Bin Laden
Dreams now materialized, ain’t no surprise
From the bottom to the top, seen the family rise

[Hook]
