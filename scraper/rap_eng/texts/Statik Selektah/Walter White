(Verse 1)

For you fanatic rap addicts this is crack in the flesh
I spit that, blue magic, yeah I package it fresh
I’m not impressed, overrated rappers average at best
The flow is, so erratic like it's manic depressed
Yo Statik Selekt
Give my vocals some dramatic effect
While I eulogize this beat
So tragic it's death
Head back from whence that you came
Cause once I’m in my pocket like lint and loose change
I kick like Liu Kang
They still wan' diminish him
Hit ‘em with that fatal blow
Screen flash “Finish Him!’
This ain’t a game boy, since my age of innocence
I’ve been having 16’s bit, no Sega Genesis
Evade the premises, evacuate the area
Barrier the fences, want some war? The more the merrier
I’m a pistol, you a derringer, a pitbull, you a terrier
I spit it, cause hysteria, then spread it like malaria

(Hook)

Can’t forget Bobby
Rep NY no lie…
…On Rockaway
Don’t Stop
Bobby
Rep NY no lie…
…On Rockaway
Don’t stop
Rep NY no lie…
…On Rockaway
Don’t Stop

(Verse 2)

*Cough Cough* Man This White Boy Sick
Hottest Cracka on the street since White Boy Rick
All I hear is, “White Boy That and White Boy This”
Best thing since White bread
Get off this White Boy’s Dick!
Never sniff hard White, but I smoke White Widow
White rappers come at me? Make their wife a White Widow
In a stretch White Limo drinking White Russians
With a ditsy blonde, dumb as dirt, busty, White Bimbo
I just wanna be the White Black Thought or the White Nas
All the hate is White Noise cause it’s White Lies
Still I’m furious, like them 5 guys who made "White Lines"
Shit, half these cats don’t even write rhymes!
I rep the boardwalk, I’m the White Chalky White
I’ll be Jesse Pinkman, Statik you be Walter White
So put the money in the White Bag
Before you’re under White Sheets with a White Tag
Wave the White Flag!

Rep NY no lie…
…On Rockaway
Don’t stop
Rep NY no lie…
