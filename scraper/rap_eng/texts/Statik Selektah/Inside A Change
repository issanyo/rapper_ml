[Intro:]
We need to avoid people who are toxic. Meaning that in every relationship between two people, people could either be toxic or nourishing to one an other. That's not say the same person will always be toxic or nourishing in every relationship, but the combination of two people in a relationship will always have toxic or nourishing qualities. And the important part, here's the test: chill with somebody. Chop it up, smoke, drink, whatever your demon is it don't matter what the fuck it is but the end of that time. You got to ask yourself a very important question. Do you feel tired or do you feel energized. Cause if you're tired, then you've been poisoned. If you got energy then you've been nourished. You are the company that you keep man. You know what, fuck your fake ass lifestyle. You look ok, your energy's tired son
