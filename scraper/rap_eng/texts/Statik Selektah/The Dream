[Sample]:
I had a dream last night but now I'm okay
I dreamt the world was gone and my momma's really old, old
I saw the screens go back as I blew my ship away
Is there no one who'll bring me my home?

[Verse One] [Termanology]:
Yeah, yeah
Reks was right
All them drunken nights, I played myself
When I could have saved myself the trouble
A million bucks, spent on that venomous stuff
That make you act dumb and throw up your guts
Fight your friends, cheat on your girl
Roll up a blunt
In front of the police station and puff
I don't give a fuck
And that's my mentality
When I'm on that stuff
That's my reality
The poison turn grown men to boys and
Wake up avoiding the voices from bad choices
Stuck in your head
I don't want to hear it instead
I crack another bottle, I'mma take this to the head
Crack another dutch, I'mma take this to the head
Pop another pill, I'mma take these till I'm dead
And tomorrow I'mma do it again
Drunk by myself, fuck all my friends
That's how I'm feeling

[Verse Two] [Reks]:
We killing ourselves
Term was right, it's either Heaven or Hell
Plenty late nights, wifey asleep
Make my bed with the devil, ain't right
I place my, blame on others, they like
"You're too foul for us to stay tight"
And they might, be on to something
I ain't shit
Born for nothing, momma could have did the stomach suction
Abortion
Think about the successes I caused them
Telling them to take a sip of poison
Couple hits, get lost then forget the problems
Cause all them stresses going bye bye when we get high
In 1982 I was a tender age
Oblivious to enemies and getting laid
Sending me to early grave
I don't give a fuck
And that's my mentality
Pencil fallacies until reality's for salary
Gradually, waking from this dream and it seems
I'm about to fade, slipping into last days
That's how I'm feeling
