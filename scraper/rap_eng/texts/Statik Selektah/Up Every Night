[Hook]:
I'm up every night losing sleep
Every midnight, every night
I'm up every night losing sleep
Every midnight, every night

[Verse One]:
I ain't worried 'bout you girl I'm tryin' to party
You could going do your thing don't even call me
I ain't fienda lose no sleep I'm on the creep
And when I'm done with my freak she gon' need new sheets
See me?
I'm a one to one, bitch better understand
You know I'm feeling myself when I be in the jam
Swag on the hundred gram bag like a hundred grams
And thats just my hemp stash, where's the hash?
If I keg stand will I forget tomorrow?
See it on Facebook and drown myself in my sorrows
See me?
I get drunk and I don't give a fuck
I'll be acting like I do, but I do this shit every month
I've be sippin', drinking, smoking, puffing up on a dutch
Some would call me a lush
Me? I would call it a rush
I got a lot of homies that's trapped up in the clutch
Really I think they nuts, cause me? I live it up

[Hook]:
I'm up every night losing sleep
Every midnight, every night
I'm up every night losing sleep
Every midnight, every night

[Verse Two]:
After party my crib is going down
Make yourself a drink there's plenty going around
Fresh from the club I ordered a couple rounds
So this people passing out and throw up on the ground
And I bagged honey with the heels
Swag on a hundred mill
We can chill and do anything that you feel
Cause I'm just a regular guy, chilling and getting high
Breath smelling like Patron with the bloodshot eyes
And mommy, you so fly you should be a stewardess
I could tell you ain't new at this, smoking and puffing buddah shit
Grey Goose with a little bit of O.J
Have 'em in the room and ready to role play
Panties flying off, she ready to try it all
This is what you call, having a ball
And when I wake up I'll be missing everything
And guess what? Next week we gon' do it again

[Hook]:
I'm up every night losing sleep
Every midnight, every night
I'm up every night losing sleep
Every midnight, every night

Bass drop!

It's driving me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get her out of my head
Kiss her, diss her
I'll take her friend instead

[Hook]:
I'm up every night losing sleep
Every midnight, every night
I'm up every night losing sleep
Every midnight, every night
