[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
It's nighttime
I can't sleep, my droog's begging me to fight crime
Plus he got a source that dropped a dime
So I'm tracking his ways
Like a cold six-pack of brews you know we cracking the case

[Verse 2: Wiki]
I'm on it
He want it
And my wallet got a piece of paper say
The address he stay
Tip-toe up the stairs
Of where he lived
Kicked in the crib
Looked like he dipped
Hand on my chin
This dude gotta pay for the shit that he did
So I'm racking my brain, heard he got a chick that live
All the way uptown so we hop right back on the train

[Verse 3: Your Old Droog]
In the last car
Headed somewhere past [?]
Stop is 207, where Dominicans roam
Got us on the A late night holding a chrome
Not going home till we pop one in his dome
Type of disrespect, can't go to police
Besides that it would violate the code of the streets
Playing vigilante and detective (but what he do?)
I'mma let my partner give you some perspective

[Verse 4: Wiki]
Heard the creep slashed homie's sister in the cheek
[?] with a piece
That ain't the half
He be taking cash
From the mans been collecting them cans
It's a brainless motherfucker
You couldn't tame this motherfucker
Yeah I blame this motherfucker
Drain this motherfucker
He crossed the line
All this talk and we had to find him all this time

[Verse 5: Your Old Droog]
Tunnel sounding like ghost screams
Lights flicker - on duty but with no blue suits
Nightstick, handcuffs, a corny badge just to make us feel tough
This your dogs, take a bite out of crime like McGruff
Stuff we seen is too much for Lisa Evers
My man fell out after eating his burrito breakfast
Once a goon tried to go in his pockets with no preface
On some Charles Bronson shit, he must got a death wish
My man stepped to him like "what you doin'?"
'Fore he heard the rest, pulled out popped 2 in his chest
Doors opened and we had to run out (yo!)
Wik' looked and me and said...
Gotta get this scum 'fore the sun comes out
125th looking real drab
We hopped in a cab
'Noid as hell, hoping we don't get nabbed
Ready for arrest evasion
Around 3:05 we arrived at our destination

[Verse 6: Wiki]
Walk in the building, elevator to the 4th floor
Wonder what we in store for
Knock, knock - I got my ear to the door (shhhhh)
No shit, I'm hearing the whore
She screaming
He's either beating this chick up or heeming
Kick in the door, run in the room, but we ain't see him
Just this bitch scheming
I said "bitch if you don't tell us where the fuck he is we ain't leaving"
I'm losing patience, been chasing this creep all evening
Wait - heard someone breathing
Turn my head and he creeping
Right out the front door, but he clocked that we peeped him
So we running now, we jumping down
Three flights of steps tryna get to this fucking clown
All night he got hunted down
But once we got outside you could tell more of them was coming 'round

[Verse 7: Your Old Droog]
And in a second it'd be flooded with neighbors
Seen habibi throwing out yesterday's papers
Couple more of the commuters was on route
But Wiki had the blicky - you know my son was gon' shoot
Firing bullets like Kirk Warner
The jerk turned the corner
Pulled some Marshall Faulk shit and did a spin
Ran after him then
That's when my man dropped his gat
And it ricocheted caught me in the shin

[Verse 8: Wiki]
Kept chasing even though Droog got a limp
I woulda stopped but I almost got this dude in my grip
Tackled the bastard
Put him on [?]
Droog caught back up, tell him what he gon' get

[Verse 9: Your Old Droog, Wiki]
Gon' get this machete
You get me?
Situation 'bout to turn deadly (it's real)
Feel like he just ran a 5k
Got him in his yard
Overlooked by the West Side Highway
Backed him down in the driveway
Looking like the New York version of Friday
Decapitated the prick
Since I can't squeeze
Stuck his head on a lamp
Then we breeze
The vigilantes
