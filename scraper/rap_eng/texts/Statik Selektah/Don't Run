[Hook 1: Joyner Lucas]
My mama told me don't run
Don't run-run away, away, away, away, away, away
Momma don't told me don't run, don't run, don't

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
I see with my eyes
Recognize it's my time
Take a drink to Mai Tais
Find a way, that's my lie
Celebrate in my prime
Get away I'ma leave you
Take a break I need to
Hold on wait, I need you
Zz ma, I'm dreaming though
Who got the keys to the Beamer though?
Who got the keys to the older one?
I know Khaled ain't the only one
Tryna play golf with the older sluts
Just a young nigga tryna get a hole in one
Sick of being broke not owning much
And all I wanna do is have Oprah's son
I see with my eyes
Recognize it's my time
Reminisce, yeah time flies
I'm a prince, uh Cyhi
Dream big, yeah, fly high
Get away I'ma leave you
Take a break I need to
Baby wait, I need you

[Pre-Hook: Joyner Lucas]
Black on black whip, my black on black bitch
Got black on black kids and shit
Black on black crime
Black on black violence
Black on black witnesses
And it's my project and you can't stop 'less
You just say I did the shit that I did
And if I die, then I bring back God
And just get all my benefits

[Hook 2: Joyner Lucas]
Ma-ma-ma told me don't run
Run away, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ma-ma-ma told me don't run
Don't run, run away, away, away, away, away, away
Momma don't told me don't run, don't run, don't run

[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
All I wanna do is give high fives
With all the pretty women in the white tights
And tell all of my enemies bye bye
You can never imitate a nigga, why try
I'm a truth, I ain't never tell a white lie
I used to push drugs in the nighttime
Tryna hit the plug on the Wifi
Wondering how many are wishing that I died
Back before I had a buzz nigga
I was nothing but a drug dealer
Ain't nobody show me love nigga
Never knew who I was
God damn I was looking for a buzz bigger
Than anyone on a Hot 100
So broke I ain't got one hundred
You a real, no you not 100
I ain't never had a lot though
But I work with what I got though
Any nigga that was ever hating
I just say I see you at the top door
Don't nobody know who you are
Yeah you just another John Doe
Just another day of old news
Just another PS2 console

[Pre-Hook: Joyner Lucas]
Black on black whip, my black on black bitch
Got black on black kids and shit
Black on black crime
Black on black violence
Black on black witnesses
And it's my project and you can't stop 'less
You just say I did the shit that I did
And if I die then I bring back God
And just get all my benefits

[Hook 1: Joyner Lucas]
Ma-ma-ma told me don't run
Don't run-run away, away, away, away, away, away
Momma told me don't run, don't run, don't run

[Verse 3: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, yeah
Never will I ever tell a motherfucking bold face lie
But I might just hop up in a Bronco and make OJ drive
Dammit, I've been nothing but a fuck up for my whole damn life
Momma told me never run away and now I still can't hide, yeah, yeah
Ain't nobody ever give me nothing, everything I got a nigga got it on his own
Ain't too much that you can tell a nigga I already know
Listen, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it however you want
Been around the way a little
Honestly, I'd rather be alone
Yeah, that'll be-that'll be the day I leave
Why you gotta act needy, you don't really hope things change
Why you gotta be so greedy, you just want the whole damn thing
No can do nigga, no can-no can say
Big fuck you to your whole damn-whole damn face
Look, I told my niggas be patient, it's only a matter of time 'fore we winning
They never want us to shine
They been praying we failing way from the beginning
I told my girl that I love her but truth is I'm young and I'm gonna keep sinning
How the hell I'm gonna be faithful when trapped with these beautiful women
I wanna fuck all of them-all of them
Never will I ever try to make you stay the whole damn time
Never will I ever tell a motherfucking bold face lie
Dammit, I've been nothing but a fuck up for my whole damn life
Momma told me never run away and now I still can't hide
Still can't hide, yeah

[Hook 1: Joyner Lucas]
Ma-ma-ma told me don't run
Don't run-run away away away away away away
Momma told me don't run, don't run, don't run
Ma-ma-ma told me don't run
Don't run-run away away away away away away
Momma told me don't run, don't run, don't run
