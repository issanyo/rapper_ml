[Hook: Styles P]
If you're under 21, you shouldn't listen to this

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Black folks, crack smoke
Big head scientist, island of Patmos
Fake tears and snakes here
Question my thug cause I ain't shoot a nigga in 8 years
Sets superior imperious rex sket interior airing ya nearing ya death inferior
Listen, it's so thuggish to sniff 'caine
Make me cold-blooded, motherfucker, I'm Rick James
Hell of a drug, Sean Price, hell of a thug
Hang with Sheen, I got elephant blood
Listen to me, y'all better not listen to me
Fuck around and catch a case, trying to be like P
Listen, a ring on you brother, I'm harming you daily
Clown, Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey
P, now download this on a disk
If you're under 21, you shouldn't listen to this
Bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Phew, just made the cut baby
Let me light this motherfucking weed I'm smoking
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
For real
Light the crack pipe so I know it's real

Whoa, young Bill Murray
I'm 21, but I feel 30
A little birdy out in Jersey said my raps were too wordy
Told his bitch to suck my dick and do a curtsy, dirty, slurpy
I smell earthy, puttin' curry on my turkey
I'm Blade 3, you're more Blades of Fury
Blonde dykes love me for my Klondike tummy
Getting all types of money, I'm with Sean Price, dummy, P
Polite stuntin' at a nice white luncheon
Met your wife, pipe plumbing, led to all night humping
Oh no, the end of your life coming
We the tribe, don't make me Phife something
My bitch from Beirut, she get loose
110 proof, call me Zeus, pussy tighter than a wet suit
Jesus Christ, he so nice
