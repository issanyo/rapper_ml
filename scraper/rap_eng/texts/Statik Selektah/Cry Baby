[Verse 1]

It's easy to stay dumb, hard to gain knowledge
Easy to sell dope, and hard to go to college
Easy to buy guns, crack, smack and chronic
The only think we ain't hooked on in the hood is phonics
It's hard to see what my mom be going through
And with these words I'm flowing through, man I'm hoping to
Change her situation, make her so enthused
And if you could do the same so would you, I know it's true
I want to make it to the top spot way from where the blocks hot
Where cops spot ya drop top you copped at the chop shop
And they're banging at your door without a knock knock
Hot shots get clocked for their watch and then pop-popped
And Glocks are bought even though they shouldn't
This ain't football but you can still catch a bullet
A lot of people don't get to live before they're buried
But don't worry I'll be home in a hurry

But I tell her..

[Hook 2x]

Don't cry baby
Just look up to the sky baby
Close your eyes baby
And imagine you can fly, we gon' fly

[Verse 2]

They look down on Roc city with pity, it's odd
They say its good here, yeah but it's clearly fa√ßade
But we're committing a fraud so seal your fear with a lock
You'll need divine intervention in the city of god
See how I perceive it, you gotta just dream and believe it
Keep with the scheming and all that's left's to achieve it
See it's nothing to find young guns dancing with the devil
They're puppets in the game, you'll see the hands of Gippetto
Bluntly, you'll get smoked on a cancerous level
Come to Roc city stone cold or get hammered to pebbles
Momma told me "Hold your ground and stay steadfast
"Cuz it's a dog-eat-dog and runner up is just dead last
"And watch your friends, they may have insane intentions
"The world's dangerous like a bus to Main and Clinton"
I said "I know it sounds crazy but have you looked up to the sky lately?"

[Hook]

Verse 3:
You know my flow be killin
Stab the beat and let it start drippin'
Tin-Man like I had my heart hidden
Found out I had it from start to finish
It took a leap of faith, but I was scared of heights
It was a point where I was low and fearing life
Now I dare anyone to declare a fight
Cuz my bro taught me I ain't have to die to reach paradise
I'm showing you these pictures and these words are what I paint it through
They want you to waste away just to do away with you
I wanna be a legend so that these words sustain the truth
That's what I aim to do
Look: I wanna make a millie. Not a million dollars
But a million real eyes realize the real lies in
The world and how we view it - what to change and how to do it
Water changes mountains that my my flow is fluid

[Hook]
