[Intro: Sample]
Get away, while you can

[Verse 1: Joe Scudda]
Champagne wishes and Caviar dreams
That life is a thing that my people never seen
Hands never clean, dirt under fingernails
Feeling like a donkey while the boss playing pin the tail
Happens all the time when you out there on the grind
I know people with degrees in them unemployment lines
Fuck catching breaks, they try'na catch a check
Pay the light bill, pray they needs getting met
Put them on they sweat, say them on they fret
By the coming weeks, dress all ain't that
And what do you expect, it really ain't surprising
With the lack of jobs and the gas keeps rising
I don't wanna regret a day, that I didn't take a chance to make it a better day
Had to figure out a better way
There's some people like me on they job, trying to get away

[Hook: Colin Munroe]
(We come, we live, we go)
You know it's only a lifetime
You better find something to say because
(We come, we live, we go)
And until you see your last day
It's moment to moment
Take a moment to get away

[Verse 2:]
I see my momma working hard for the fam'
But it hurts me as a man, I can get her out a jam
I try to take the little money that I make
Break a little bread, go and lend a hand
As I reflect, on what I just said
My dad two months in on a hospital bed
My eyes bloodshot red
If I gotta watch him go, then I'm better off dead
Cause I ain't tryna see it, I wish you could believe it
Would be better forever, cause help I really need it
And I ain't too conceded, to ask you for a hand
Cause I know as a man with a boost Imma reach it
Stand on my own, spread my wings
Soaring through the clouds, getting out dreams, doing my thing
Make my folks proud, cause I love to see 'em smile when we living like kings
Yeah we gotta get away

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
You can't understand or phathom
How tough it is for me to pen this
I tried to smile, but for some while
It's been hard cause my pain is endless
I search my soul, try to to reflect
Live straight, don't worry bout the angles
I thought I was done with this record
But my pops went to rest with the angles
So I had to relive his death
Sitting by his bed, watching his last breath
And I can still hear mom screaming
"Lord please", with her hand on her chest
And everybody in the room crying
Hardest shit I ever seen no lying
So pops, you gone live through me
And I'mma make you proud or I'mma die trying
I'm gonna get away

[Hook:]
