[Hook: Apathy]
Cause when the mic’s off and when the beat stops
I’m only human homie, it’s only Hip Hop
And when the show’s over and when the curtains drop
I’m just a person man, it’s only Hip Hop

(It’s okay, it’s alright, let me live my life)
"Now I’m in the limelight ’cause I rhyme tight"
It’s only hip hop
(Run away, alright, I’m gonna live my life)
"Now I’m in the limelight ’cause I rhyme tight"
It’s only hip hop

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I never thought when I was younger anybody’d know
A single word of my raps and memorize my flow
Now I’m mesmerized when they show up at my shows
And wanna pose for photos rocking Apathy clothes
They asking me about Vinnie and our religious belief
They asking me about Kamachi, if we had real beef
What I think about Kanye, if I really hate him
And then proceed to repeat me my freestyle verbatim
I love my fans and wouldn’t trade em but somebody gotta train them
Momma need to raise em how to act around MCs
I was a fan but always respect boundaries
You’d never catch me asking Method Man about his seeds
Love is love, love is real, love is great
But when it isn’t reciprocated it could become hate
Frustrated cause I never responded to you on Twitter
Maybe I just didn’t see it, don’t be getting all bitter, listen

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Apathy]
And when the songs were done and when the beats were over
I gave a pound and kept it moving, never sweated Hova
Fans analyze our rhymes, artwork, and posters
And treat Mike Shinoda like he’s Deepak Chopra
I’m real appreciative but please act like you’re supposed to
I hate suckers like Hex Murda hates Oprah
It’s cool if you say your favourite rapper’s Apathy
But don’t be getting all overzealous and faggoty
They asking me about Celph and if he got all them guns
Asking me about my personal life and my funds
Joking with me like they known me for years
You’re just a little too comfortable homie, we’re no peers
Don’t greet me by my government name just cause you bought my album, you wouldn't walk up on Snoop Dogg and call him Calvin
Listen man, it’s a real simple rule
Keep cool, don’t be coming out your mouth like a fool, you know?

[Hook]

[Ad-Lib]
I'd like to thank my brother Statik Selektah
For placin' me with this beat
I'd also like to thank my real fans who support and show love
Without gettin' outta place, oversteppin' boundaries
Be a man, motherfucker
Yeah
Apathy
Demigodz
Pharaoh Clique
Forever, motherfucker
Yeah
