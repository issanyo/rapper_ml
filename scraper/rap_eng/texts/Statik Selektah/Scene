(Sample) Never let me go

(No oh, oh no)

[Hook]
Back on the scene, back on the scene is the incredible
Back on the scene, back on the scene is the incredible
Back on the scene, they want you back on the scene

[Verse 1]
Hot and cold you don't know
These types of games that you play
The tickets have sold
Go back in line and just wait
You can't get nothing from me
You come around and there's always something
This isn't make believe
They'll take your heart out as long as you stay

[Hook]
Back on the scene, they want you back on the scene
Back on the scene, they want you back on the scene oh

(Dj scratches)

[Verse 2]
Yo yo, uh
They on some hot and cold then hopping on my dick shit
Ridiculous, dumb and dumber motherfuckers rapping Lloyd Christmas
And if you go the distance, they'll hold you till infinity they got Souls Of Mischief
My vernacular is out of your league, I'll fucking punish your capital, shatter your dreams
No they never saw a singer that's rapping this mean, they kind of embarrassed I'm back on the scene
And all these other MC's singing is vomit, thinking they're a star but I'm a comet
And I'm just being honest, and I don't care if I'm alone
I'm back on the scene to destroy the microphone

[Hook]
Back on the scene, they want you back on the scene
Back on the scene, they want you back on the scene

Back on the scene is the incredible, back on the scene is the incredible (No no, oh no)

Open up your heart, pour the evil out you
