[Featuring: Reks, Joe Scudda and JFK]
[Sample:]
Didn't want to do it
Didn't want to break your heart
Didn't want to do it
Didn't want to break it from the very start

[Chorus: Reks]
Drunken night I
Wish I never played myself I
Didn't wake up so fucked up that I could actually touch the sky

[Verse 1: Reks]
Many drunken nights I
Woke up so fucked up I touched the Heaven gates as I elevate
Think about my hellish state
And it ain't me and the E, it's Hennessy
Me and Statik be, sippin' on somethin' til we gone
'Til I'm on, I will be, Dom not Perignon
But poems I'm heavy on, I see the dead and gone
In my songs, they are me, we are one
Play myself some, times too many, one mind on Remy
Mar'-tin cause, so much drama for me
Can't we all just get along?
Anyone feel me?
Problems and where they come from, please tell me
To my moms I am sorry, so sorry that I cause you pain
J.F.K., I know you know what I'm sayin'
I'm flowin' again, by wakin' up so fucked up until I touch the sky
On them drunken nights

[Chorus: Reks]
Drunken night I
Wish I never played myself I
Didn't wake up so fucked up that I could actually touch the sky

[Verse 2: Joe Scudda]
Uh, many drunken nights I
Woke up empty liquor bottles around me
Beside a strange bitch, 'cause that's where they found me
I don't even know her name but no reason to explain
'Cause the stupid shit I did, I'm a problably do again
And, you can bet you bottom buck on it
Take a swig of the beer, here from the tables with the cups on it
Lord knows I be sinnin'
But when I"m drunk, everbody knows I be grinnin'
Sorry if I'm offendin', people thumpin' them Bibles
Cause I'm libel, to do anything they say ain't tribal
So relax and fall back
Early morning smokes, now I"m happy as hell, I found an old pack
Inhale, exhale, think about last nights details
But they hard to recall
Guess the alcohol, got my head bangin'
And me sayin'

[Chorus: Reks]
Drunken night I
Wish I never played myself I
Didn't wake up so fucked up that I could actually touch the sky
