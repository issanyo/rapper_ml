[Intro]
Yeah, yo, one-two, one-two
Yeah, this take

[Verse]
Yo, suicide, it's a suicide, entertainin' that bullshit
Rap is a religion, watch me step up to the pulpit
Bless 'em with the truth I spit
These Devils tryin' to Dylann Roof my shit
I got seeds for the babies, don't ever try to play me
Like so-called DJ's, but me I call 'em JD's
A lot of you niggas be spinnin' and I be So-So Def
When tryin' to cater to the youngin's, shit can go so left
I let the world listen, track sells soon as you hear me
Connect like Bluetooth, don't try to compare me
My lines, fuck with ya mind when they spoken
Rappers I look up to, Trojan
Pause, I'm killin' y'all pussies with a cause
My shit knock, I'm guessin' that's the reason they adore
Uh, I pour liquor, more slicker in my drunken takes
All pure, no flaws like the sunken place
I hear a lot of tunes, see a lot of coons
That shit played out, you ain't heard the news?
Y'all do it for jewelry and tennis shoes
I love Beyonc√©, but I hate jigga boos
The game different, most solo acts is wack
Even the crews weak like "Damn!"
We went from Dipsets to dipshits
And young niggas aimin' at the lens like they tryin' to kill the cam
Yo, I told God he can work through me
World say what's up to the new me
Their vibe so moody 'cause last year shit was so boujee
But since I'm in my bag, she wanna pursue me
Who me? I'm humbly the cockiest
Comin' up, took the right steps on some Rocky shit
Original, lot of y'all guys on some copy shit
But nah, only one I, La Di Da Di shit
La Di Da Di, we work not party
'Til at the top, you all seein' I, Illuminati
Tested hardly, anticipated highly
How can I lose if the city got me? Yeah

[Outro]
No need to front now, niggas know the stro
Don't stop- don't- don't stop
No need to front now, niggas know the stro
Don't stop- don't- don't stop
No need to front now, niggas know the stro
Don't stop- don't- know- don't- know- don't stop, get it, get it
No need to front now, niggas know the stro
Don't stop- don't- don't stop, get it, get it
