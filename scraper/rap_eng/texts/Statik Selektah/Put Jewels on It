Move on it
Put jewels on it
Who want it
Move on it
Put jewels on it
Who want it
I don't fuck a- fuck a- fuck around dunny

[Verse One: Wais P]
Drag my big toe in my crocodile's low
Top phoenix, top notch pimp
I've reached my zenith
Bitch, you got to pay to touch the penis
I've seen it
Getting guap
At the same time, getting even
These bitches been thievin'
Having dudes pay for evenings
You ain't paying for her sex
You're paying for her leavin'
Ya'll dreamin' buying stock schemin'
Better than steamin' outta Bloomingdale's stealin'
Versace
Credit card jams, baby watch me
Ponzi scams
Raping investors, making full monty
And she'll body a nigga for the full bounty
Doing time and never snitched when she's in the county
That's why I only keep real hoes around me
And real joes
No moissanites to crown me
And real niggas like Roc Marciano
This record right here 'bout to make slight Bono
Or maybe Tommy Mottalo
Hustlers lotto
Let's both pool our chips and cop the Apollo
Or cop the Garden and make the starting five
All gangsters
You've gotta lose to stay alive

Move on it

Put jewels on it
Who want it
Move on it
Put jewels on it

I don't fuck a- fuck a- fuck around dunny

[Verse Two: Roc Marciano]
Eat and pop tags
Scotch in the glass
We the top brass
Got mad tats like a triad
The diamond flash like a dime bag
That will freeze your eyelash
If you can grind and buy why finance
The Cayenne, I call her Diane
Nas ride a diaphragm
You're fighting like Richard Pryor's hands
Clients crowd her with quiet grams
Just trying bare requires prayer, inside my lair
Is a science fair
I fuck vagina on a giant bear
Try to snare
I was guided here to stand the solitaires
Spotted on the project stairs
This pair cook Pyrex squares
D-Squares who don't be shares
Keep them cheap beers
Treat your feet fair
Speak clear inside of fair air
Cassingle yeah
Sleek with the gear like Indian hair, yeah
Fuck boy
