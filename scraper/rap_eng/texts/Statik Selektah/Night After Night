[R&B sample]
"Night after night, the same old story"
"Day after day, the same old thing"

[Intro: Slaine]
This shit is all funny (take this back to 1999)
Shit is fucked up right now (take it back to '96 style)
I made it~! I made it in this game
(Yo let's take it back to '91 style!)
But I'm still hungry for more
(Yo fuck it man let's take it back to '89...)
I ain't get what I'm supposed to get yet

[Slaine]
I came in this game with integrity and a provocative promise
Stepped in the booth with my youth sipping vodka and orange
Juice I sip it, it beat beefs and rocking performance
Mind in a cloudy haze and my shotgun's enormous
I'm mopping the floor with you dudes with legs that couldn't run fast
In the hood where guns blast, heroin is king
It never meant a thing; I ain't gettin young fast, I'm getting older
Now I got a colder, smile than I ever had
Doggy I'm a hater I'm forever mad
You live in never never land and got a head that I can sever fast
Shout out to Ill Bill, Cypress Hill, and Everlast
D.M.S. we ride the storm until the weather pass
My fists, forever fast with combinations
An abomination even when I'm calm and patient sleeping like a trauma patient
You claim king homey you live in your momma's basement
I'm a Knight at the Round Table chilling with God and Satan

[Hook: scratched]
(Night after night) "Night after night, the same old story"
(The same shit) "Day after day, the same old thing"

[Slaine]
These are the words of a manifesto - and I'm the author of it
The razor blades spit to leave a slit across your stomach
The wisdom and change are trapped inside my torture summit
They fall asleep in the tub and leave the faucet running
Am I a visionary prophet cause I saw shit coming?
A reflection in the glass with the crosses hung and
I'm a young and dumb and full of cum but I could pull a gun
For no other reason, show you where the bullets from
I spent many nights getting bent with Henny right
Writing rhymes staying in my lane that shit is plenty white
Come on I came up, I'm making it happen
But I'm takin back, whoever thought I'd make this shit rapping?
But I'm here

[Hook]

[Slaine]
Going for the gusto my brothers, I fuck it up for my nuccas
Throw dice with my right hand just a couple bucks from a hundred
See him paint the picture vivid like he must have been from it
I ain't never gave a fuck or adjusted to none it
Holding bottles in the air drinking substances from it
I been through the dark, I know what it was to become it
I plummet, fall fall into the madness
My habits got me on the knees, crawling to the sadness
My ladder's, got broken steps mad at what matters
And mad at the mirror, I leave the shit battered and shattered
I've had it with addicts, I've had it I'm erratic erratic
Peace to Statik and every junkie who lives in a shack...
Peace

[Hook]

[Outro]
PEACE!!!
