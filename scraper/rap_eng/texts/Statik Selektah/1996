[Verse 1]
We smoking and drinking
Me and Statik couple of friends of ours
Scotty, B, O, Easy, Mo and Termanology
The seminar's gotta be hip-hop
I read it in the stars like astronomy, zip locks
But I'm on parole, I can't piss hot
Cause that'll get the kid locked
We talkin bout these rappers
That sold the niggers who shit flop
My shit hot but I never really got a chance to shine
Turn back the hands of time
You can see my plan to grind
I speak to people who struggle
Those are the fans are mine
I tell'em life is a movie
That niggers can't rewind
They love the fact that I spit
With such a ferociousness
Static was the best one
Recording all of my vocal shit
You know the script was freezing
When they was cold as shit
When the time stayed with a runny nose
Cause my coke was my ripped
And niggers know that still
Said I was poor as hell
That's I rap and search vision
Cause I got more to tell
Could it been a offer?
I pull a surprise winner
Instead I hit the block
I was starving to find dinner
Young niggers love the light
Cause in dark you gonna find sinners
On a bed just run in the park
Like I'm Scott Brinner
Cause I'm in a state of mind of a crime committer
You shine and glitter
Talkin greezy behind yo Twitter
I'm on the front lunge of a war
That you can't imagine
Serious shit no jokes
Far from a nigga laughin
We sit back and reminisce
When the game wasn't about silly percentages
I think we should take it back to the genesis
I know all my real niggers remember this
