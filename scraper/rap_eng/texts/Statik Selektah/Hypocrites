[Verse One]:
Ayo rappers in the industry are some of the worst
But I listen to Illmatic before I write any verse
It hurts to hear these rappers say they used to sling crack
But I couldn't leave my house without an ounce in my back
Pack, going to school, lookin' out for my grades
But now I'm droppin' out of college cause I feel like a slave
To this game that we call life, workin' hard to be rich
Workin' two jobs just to say the workin' man was a bitch
And you material objects only make you inferior
But I copped a 325 will leather interior
Here we go again
I'm holdin' hands with my girl
When I used to say that marriage is the last thing in the world
For me, you see we all believe in He
But He's the one we curse when our knees get weak
We're all hypocrites
Shit I ain't one of a kind
And I might hate the industry but I can't wait to get signed

[Hook]:
We're all hypocrites
Rap is the worst
When I came in second, always came in at first
Never held a gat
Got mad guns in my crib
Smoke hurtin' my lungs
Never puffed as a kid
Never in jail
$100,000 in bail
Straight A's
Every single class that I fail
Sick of nothin'
Tired of livin' in fear
All this hypocritical shit that you spit in my ear

[Verse Two]:
I say one thing
And then I do the other
Like play my girl, blame my pops cause he played my mother
I know they want it
I don't need the chronic or the gin and tonic
To show that I'm honest, Hooked On Dom not Phonics
Bunch of hip hop hypocrites
That don't even give a shit about their credibility
My guess is that they're illiterate
There's gotta be at least ten in the game
Ten of the same motherfuckers, I ain't sayin' no names
Studio gangsta
Inside the booth you'll shank me
Outside you thank me, the shit gets me angry
Listen B
Dissin' me is riskin' your life explicitly
Your style is synonymous with all your inconsistencies
So next time you write, just write to write
Write to fight, everything that's wrong in your life
Just make it right
Don't just make it happen
I'm a hypocrite but not when it comes to rappin'
One

[Hook]:
Hypocrites
Rap is the worst
When I came in second, always came in at first
Never held a gat
Got mad guns in my crib
Smoke hurtin' my lungs
Never puffed as a kid
Never in jail
$100,000 in bail
Straight A's
Every single class that I fail
Sick of nothin'
Tired of livin' in fear
All this hypocritical shit that you spit in my ear
