Verse 1: Guilty Simpson [24 Bars]
I used to dream about it
Then I woke up went and got it
My warm heart rotted
Gotta get something' for my pockets
And I dare a mother fucker try and stop it, I'm petty boy
Steppin' on my toes, we'll forever war
Until it's agreed, we settled score
For better or, for best fam
I won't accept less than
The corner got me in a press jam
They wanna hold a ring like the best man
But still I'm the king of the best land
Overseein', rollin' green overseas in the snowy season
You don't believe go and see I'm the only reason
Some go and see 'em screaming' in the front row, all gung ho
Far stretch from the slums tho.. my city is a gun show (blaw)
So what should I do, besides strap up two?
In the window of the birds eye view
Like a falcon, nah, more like Malcom with the same outcome
Fate is something that we can't outrun
So I'm holding' my ground, till your soldiers get down
But they better come correct, cause I'm holding' some rounds
I'm the city, my heart beats 'mo--to-the-town'

Chorus 1: DJ Statik Selektah (Cuts) [8 Bars]
I'm the city
Walk the walk with me
I'm the city
Talk the talk with me
I'm the city
Walk the walk with me
I'm the city
Talk the talk with me
I'm the city
Talk the city with me

Verse 2: Guilty Simpson [16 Bars]
When I finally catch a certain rapper
I'm a punch him in his face till my hand breaks
Or his jaw and his cheek bones shatter
Whatever comes first, on site, no handshakes
Don't let the music, confuse it, I'm ruthless
The problem became the solution
But don't act stupid, I'm still under construction
I can still relapse and get crews hit (bap bap bap)
Like that, the new me didn't write that
He leaves and comes right back
You riden' out, get your white snatched
Mina mina, but I lobby to bring ice back
The current level easily I'm twice that
Cause I write real life raps that's colder that an ice pack
Stomp a rapper till my Nike's crack (concrete)
No pity, so come get me

Verse 3: Boldy James [24 Bars]
What's a King to a God, but a dream to a nod
I'm the real thing, yo you a facade
I used to run a peal ring, fuckin' with the mob
In front of my buildin, tuckin' in my charm
Cause it drew to much attention, not because of gettin' robbed
But with the intention of Kings pushin' my Pawns
This is Chess not Checkers
So make your next move your best one
Or catch your last breath trying catch it
Catchin' up to God quick, with the quickness
So don't get no bright ideas ni**a, cause we hit them (lights out)
You f----n' dim wit, imbecile, nincompoop, past nimb wit
I got a very short wit, and a long stick, get flipped
And little do they know, we don't miss sh*t
Sh*t, might catch your body, ain't nobody exempt
Anybody can get it (anybody)
You take somethin' from me and lay your hand on me, you get hit
When I'm looking through the scope from a distance (long range)
Home of the Pistons (Detroit)
Only ni**a goin' the distance
While these ni**as pu**ies in black pantyhose and some fish nets, it's concrete

Chorus 2: DJ Statik Selektah (Cuts) [8 Bars]
I'm the city
Walk the walk with me
I'm the city
Talk the talk with me
I'm the city
Walk the walk with me
I'm the city
Talk the talk with me
I'm the city
Talk the city with me

Outro Cuts: [8 bars]
In the conditions of the city (Common)
I'm the city (Guilty Simpson)
