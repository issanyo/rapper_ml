[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Uh, we book niggas for shows
Take all they money and jewelry
Put good dick in these hoes
Butt naked, leave 'em exposed
My bitches, I line 'em up
Sex texts, naked pics, have 'em thinking she down to fuck

That's my MO, at the M-O-T-E-L
With a hot plate of some hard bitch, I bet these sells
Quicker than Jordans on a Saturday, psycho like Donny Hathaway
I just want to make dough and fuck bitches like I'm a Latter-Day
Saint, but I ain't, bitch I'm one of Satan's descendents
Fathering niggas flows, I should claim 'em like they're dependents
Taxin' niggas on wax cause they get in rap just to act
Trappin' and packing gats, I was rapping after the fact
Arrest court date, hard times, heart break
Grind 'til the last crumb, selling dubs soft shake
And the cluckers can't wait
Is you working today or not Fred
An open shop and a close mouth'll keep your mouth fed

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs] x2
Lord giveth, Lord taketh away
Make a dollar, fuck tomorrow, we gon' take it today
I guess I'm in to take your shit, that's what it take to get paid
You a gangster, do your thing and take your shit to the grave, nigga

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Uh, we book niggas for clubs
They say they don't need security, claiming they really thugs
I'm legit, so I could give two shits if you really was
Plus I'm plugged with some fools that'll put your dick in the mud

Have a rapper do a walk through, let the nigga walk out
Pistols on the promoter, don't trip us or we're gonna chalk out
Show a nigga some show money
Bitches take off that shiny shit
Man it's so dry out here, niggas cutting they dope with vitamins
Acetone, hard to leave that crack alone
Government got heroin addicts strung out on this methodone
New dope, new wave, four P's, OxyContin OP's
Can't break it down or shoot it, I think you gotta snort these
Plenty niggas OD, not just on drugs
But I'm chasing money fuck it, so the fo' wait for fo G's
And it was some bullshit, but I had to get it in
Took it back from his ass gon' re-up and sell that shit again...Gibbs
