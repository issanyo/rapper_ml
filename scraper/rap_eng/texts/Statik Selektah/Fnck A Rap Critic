F--- A Rap Critic:

[Intro]:

[Verse 1: Jay Storm]

F--- a rap critic, I'm rap's gift, in the crack kitchen
Over hot stoves, I drop flows, like you trap chicken
Watch 'em gamble in 'em chicken fights, youngin you ain't livin right
How many youngins gotta die, before you know that pistols strike, blah
Get your money keep your team straight
Regardless of the fuckery just stay out of a fiends way
Cause you don't care about his life right
Well he don't care about his shit neither
The shit deeper, than anything that you speak of
Maliciously Pusha Ton till they realize that we Re'd up, yup
Who the fuck these niggas think they are, huh
Spittin bars that are off the wall
Black and white, black and white, it's blacker than white
You try to separate the colors, then how do you write
You try to separate the colors then how do you type
But if we separate 'em maybe then, we'll uncovers the lie's, huh?

[Hook]:

[Verse 2: Sho-Biz]

Hello Brooklyn, I swear to God that you made me
Speaking so vivid you can hear this in HD
Hit the Bronx a couple years, College Ave almost raised me
But Crown Heights needed a baby so I came right back, ha
In the same place that I started at
Where I used to rock Overalls and Starter caps
Now I’m grey brim New Riches and hard denim
Army dressed in YF tee’s, going to war with them
The newest coups, I swear that my niggas all in ‘em
They taking shots I swear I don’t even spar with ‘em
By any means my niggas is finna shine
Feeling like Malcolm peeking behind them blinds
Ready to kill any nigga trying to touch what’s mine
Young, black and militant take a look inside this mind
We ain’t never scared, Google me I swear to God that we everywhere
The jungle that you blog about, we live in, bitch we tenants here, yeah
