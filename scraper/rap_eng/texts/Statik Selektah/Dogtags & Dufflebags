Dog tags Duffle Bags,  canteen, Jim Beam
Big Red chewing gum, red pack, nicotine
Magazines laying 'round, if they empty, fill them up
7 mags, 30 rounds, battle load, militant
Bible in my breast pocket, rifle in my hand
Distant sound of helicopters fighting in the land
Hellfire, rocket fire, everything is blowing
Tank tracks, hummer tires, everything is rollin'
2-40, M-4, everything we holding
Frag out, flash bang, everything we throwing
Casualties of war, lost a couple brothers fighting for some reasons maybe questionable everything is golden though
Lock n loaded, feeling like it's overload. Pull me down
Bullets flying like a rodeo without the bull and clown
I done seen a hundred rockets hit the ground
Dirt landing in my drivers seat, 50 caliber spitting rounds... blaaaooww!

Chorus

DogTags Dufflebags, Pornstars, centerfolds
City boy turned country boi, with that can of skoal
DVD players with the bootleg dvds
CD players bump boot camp (boot camp click) in the CVC
Back home people watch the war from a TV screen
Talking shit like they know, none of yall are seeing me
Yall don't know what freedom be
This is how I really feel
Talking like a rebel but you never seen a battlefield
Never had to grab the steel
Never felt the rattle reel
Never delt with shattered steal
Never had to wagon wheel, chill
That was militant talk
Full sprints til it burns so our citizens walk
Shin splints from the ruck sack weight and Teflon plates on my back
And bad back I slept on tanks, man
The little things that I appreciate
Let this bump til the mutha phukin speakers break

CHORUS

DogTags Dufflebags around my neck, on my back
Represent where you from everyday never slack
Candles burn for that loss, uniform camoflague
Pearl Jam, Aerosmith, flag in my dad's garage
Short days long nights, short stay, long fight
North Star when I'm lost, been to war all my life
War is necessary though
Til that cemetery stones placed above my body and I reach the Lord in heavens throne
Patriot in stereo
Listen, between you and i?
Hoping that this talk isn't rap suicide
From the desert to the streets, I'm a bad muh fucka
Yall call me a sheep, well Baaaa muh fucka
Ignorance is bliss, I'm not saying that yall wrong but I'm saying that I'm strong, took a stand muh fucka
I'm never scared muh fucka
It's just a song so, there muh fucka

Chorus
