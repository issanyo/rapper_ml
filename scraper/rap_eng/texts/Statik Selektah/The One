[Intro]
(This is not for the radio!)
Yo, you gotta turn you volume all the way up on this one
(This is for the people!)
You are now listening to the sounds of the one
Reks. Statik Selektah
This gon' get a lot of people offended
As if I give a fuck

[Verse One]
I am not a racist, but I do not believe in equality
Nigga, spic, honky, follow me
Now that I got your attention, bitch you can swallow me
I can give a fuck if you get offended, I gotta speak
Nigga this, nigga that, first learn a nigga's facts
This entire country been built on black people's backs
This entire country been built on black people's backs
This entire country been built on black people's backs
I am not homophobic, but I do not believe in you faggots
Stay in the closet, Catholic priest maggot
Elton John habits, raised with Bert and Ernie in bathtubs
Scrubbing each other's backs, that's ass-backwards
Parents teaching they kids like R. Kelly and Jackson
Bitches flaunting bellies cause tight shirts' the fashion
Where the fuck is the guidance, the education, the passion?
Where the fuck is the guidance, the education, the passion?
I am not a gangsta, but I do not believe that you pop shells
Cook coke, bag hoes, got mil's
What have we learned from all the rappers who got killed?
All of this commotion in rap, most of it's not real
Ain't even been on the block as much as you on the block
But we be off the block moment that we had a deal
Said we be off the block moment that we had a deal
Said we be off the block (ONE! ONE! ONE! ONE!)
I am no politician and I do not believe in our government
'Bout Saddam or where Osama went
We know where the soldiers are, still we keep pouring on
Pouring more dead bodies on the dead bodies
And instead of hearing sorry we get four more years
Of the Bush family killing, ignoring our tears
When Diddy said, "vote or die", Jada asked the question "why?"
We sat and watched our brothers fall like Ray Charles did
I am not a rapist, still I believe you can be touched
Get held down and then get crushed
Robbery expert, believe this a stick-up
Murder the opposition, diverging the competition
The middle finger still up, fuck the world
Life's a bitch, I feel cause my bottles half empty
I have not the energy for enemies and such
Half this industry washed up, the other half suck
I am not the unsigned hype, I'm the unsigned five mics
I'm two knocks, look dice, these are the right price
People, I breathe light
The ressurection of two Bigs, one Pac, one Christ
I am not the devil
I'm speaking from beneath his level tryin' to reach the sunshine like Icarus
Flow still ridiculous, whole click is syndacite
Spit sentences infinite, to the death
Who am I? Who am I?
I'm the one
