{Verse 1}
Used to live in iller conditions
With little food in the kitchen
My single mother was workin'
Im in my Room spittin' writtens
Outside the crib people crippin'
Gun grippin', smokin & trippin'
With children seeing them illin'
The future wasn't so vivid
I left and hung with the homies
He had a pistol he showed me
He borrowed it from his Poppa
I thought my Poppa ain't know me
Cause he was out of the picture meanwhile
I'm thinking forget ya, I'm headed back to the crib
To perfect my art an get richer
OG's knew I rapped and they call me that little nigga
I stayed away from the rock but my favorite rapper was Jigga
The baddest kid in the school every week I'm gettin' suspended
I made a promise to Momma that I would start actin' different
And if I did get studio time to record my lyrics
That's when I started to listen
My homies said I went missin'
Forget the streets I'm on beats it's cool but I'm tryna leave
Get some green in my family tree and I'm here but
I honestly..

{Chorus}
Didn't know
Didn't know I'd get this green
The chicks that used to scream
Got me up in they dreams
I didn't know
Didn't know I'd come out clean
The only time the homies see me
Is on TV screens
I didn't know....(if you don't know)
I didn't know....(if you don't know)
I didn't know....(if you don't know, now you know, nigga)

{Verse 2}
I'm back stage at most shows
I fit sharp like cholos
Got free clothes by the boatloads
I keep it blunt, don't smoke though
Got more O's and more bros
When I was broke I didn't know
Chicks round, they strip down
For per diem but I let em know
[?] be getting my loot, Mama proud
Young'n made something out of self, much rent down
Called my phone but I'm busy doing shows out of town
Tackle tracks and I act, yo I think I'm Jim Brown
From the ground to the crown, can't complain
Every day the team find a new wifey, who knew we'd marry Janes?
Barbarella status, super women that's into action
A well known poet flashin when the cameras snappin
My gift always been rapping so next Christmas
We got checks, and we got checks all on the wishlist
Couldn't predict this, from hangin with the wrong audience
To running the show, I'm finally livin but in the beginning
I didn't know

{Chorus}
