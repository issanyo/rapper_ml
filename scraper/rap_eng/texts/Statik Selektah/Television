(Chorus)
There's nothing you could do that will change my mind
Once we hit play we can't press rewind
When you're in my television
When you're in my television oh oh

(Verse)
Treat me like a record store
Listen when you come inside
You might wanna hit record
Cause everything we do is live

(Verse)
Ain't no standard definition
My quality's high
We don't need no electrician
Our energy's high

(Pre-chorus)

If there is a rainstorm
My satellite
Could always be your guide

(Chorus)
There's nothing you could do that will change my mind
Once we hit play we can't press rewind
When you're in my television
When you're in my television

(Verse : Wais P)
We didn't have to go whip it with your molly
We poppin' molly snipping whitney acting so crazy
And everything hazey, stumbling mumbling
Something about I can't feel my face and mouth
It's my world, my pimpin, my television
Programming casting hoes with every huge wagons
My pants sagging but my shoes so clean
My team blue flagging but my only color's green
Cut shooting rep my team looking like a fence
Go barbwire think I lost my fire
To the MDMA they bout to send me away
Jenice jogging , clean popping, drinking vodka all day
Feeling like its cold veins in my veins
If what you say makes sense, why am I insane
Come get high with your maine
Higher than paper planes making rains our swag's never the same

(Chorus)
There's nothing you could do that will change my mind
Once we hit play we can't press rewind
When you're in my television
When you're in my television

(Verse)
Just watch what you never been
When you step aside the screen you can see what you never been
I be rappin like a veteran
Ain't nobody seen a fig like this in the televish
And I'm in hell in scripts
Rocking diamonds on D's on my sleeves 'cause it's elegant
Being a lady getting hella pen
And when I'm finished swimming in it making them sentences irrelevant

(Pre-Chorus)
If there is a rainstorm
My satellite
Could always be your guide

(Chorus)
There's nothing you could do that will change my mind
Once we hit play we can't press rewind
When you're in my television
When you're in my television
