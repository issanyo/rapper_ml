[Hook]
The streets show me love
Cause I come from the mud
Yeah I come from the slums where them niggas selling drugs
And them niggas toting guns
Yeah I done been through everything
You gotta cherish everything
The streets show me everything
Yeah they show me love
Cause I come from the mud
Yeah I come from the slums where them niggas selling drugs
And them niggas toting guns
Yeah I done been through everything
You gotta cherish everything
The streets show me everything
Everything, everything

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I come from the hood
Everybody's a shooter and the street is filled with blood
Got some niggas screaming "blood," some niggas screaming "cuz"
They caught up in the game, [?] decisions by the judge
This is everyday so we walk around with a grudge
But I'ma tell you this, I ain't never give a fuck
All we know is how to hustle, ducking undercovers and
We know we ain't shit but our momma's still love us, yeah
I come from the mud, graduated from the gutta
So I celebrated cause I made it from the gutta
But the streets still buzzing
You could hate it or love it, I'ma rep it
I know what it is cause I'm from it so
You ain't gotta wait til a nigga dead and gone
Just to show the homie love, you could show me now
Follow me, I'ma show you how to hold it down

[Hook]
The streets show me love
Cause I come from the mud
Yeah I come from the slums where them niggas selling drugs
And them niggas toting guns
Yeah I done been through everything
You gotta cherish everything
The streets show me everything
Yeah they show me love
Cause I come from the mud
Yeah I come from the slums where them niggas selling drugs
And them niggas toting guns
Yeah I done been through everything
You gotta cherish everything
The streets show me everything
Everything, everything

[Verse 2]
They got my back against the wall
[?] 52 blocks
These niggas treat you like a bitch [?] a few shots
Trying to make a dollar, narcotics stashed in my tube socks
Stopped and frisked got me [?]
Try to be a family man, get married and [?] but damn
They done hit the [?] with like fifty shots
And these youngins tryna get what we got
We talked to 'em but they try to do it big while they listen to Pac
Corner violence
Dropped out of junior high to roam projects
Hustling for loud, Gucci belts, and foam posits
Mommy's smoked out, daddy's gone, shit's real
Don't know the last time he had a home cooked meal
Rocking bandanas claiming colors, he a threat now
Claiming respect now, holding the set down
Lil Fame, Statik Selekt now, come on!

[Hook]
The streets show me love
Cause I come from the mud
Yeah I come from the slums where them niggas selling drugs
And them niggas toting guns
Yeah I done been through everything
You gotta cherish everything
The streets show me everything
Yeah they show me love
Cause I come from the mud
Yeah I come from the slums where them niggas selling drugs
And them niggas toting guns
Yeah I done been through everything
You gotta cherish everything
The streets show me everything
Everything, everything
