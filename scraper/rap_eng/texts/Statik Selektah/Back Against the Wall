(*Sample plays in the background throughout the song*)

[Intro - Royce Da 5'9" - talking] (Sample)
Yeah, aiyyo Statik, my family
You know how sometimes you just feel like ya
Like your back is against the wall
You might go through a particular situation or something
(Sitting here waiting for tomorrow)
It ain't gotta be jail
It could be, what you goin through in your life
Like the industry or some bullshit
So I think you need to put together
The right type of motherfuckers
You could put the realest niggas you could think of on this record
And just kick real shit, know what I'm talkin 'bout?
Royce Da 5'9"

[Verse 1 - Royce Da 5'9"]
They try to have your man slavin, back to the pavement, ass to the floor
Thinkin of raps as spit through the cracks in the door
Learnin how to accept losses
Writin to the sound at night of the depths walkin
To the rhythm of keys jinglin, cells openin
Inmates hopin that he thinks his bail rollin in
When it's over, it's back to totin
That's for sure as, back to clappin that fo' fo' again
Popos know it's him and they know it's 'Mega too
So we roll around the city like we just as dead as you
Bet if you, threaten us nigga, then the threat is you
You know that they say restin in heaven betters you
Therefore I can +Make Him Better+ like Ne-Yo
Tell him I said and tell 'em don't be tellin my PO
Statik Selek' and Cormega, Nickel
That is the lesson, Showoff Records, that is official

[Hook - Sample]
Back against the wall
Back against the wall (back against the wall)
Back against the wall
(Keep your head up)
Back against the wall (back against the wall)

[Cormega talking over Hook]
Uh, uh, yeah, yo

[Verse 2 - Cormega]
I adapt to all, whether real or fake
When my back against the wall, I make the building shake
Like G Fresh and Ron Love, can you relate?
The flow is cocaine raw, I can't feel my face
Niggas think shit's sweet 'til I give 'em a taste
Of de-feat, even Kings fear a lyrical ace
Don't make requests if we ain't friends, give me my space
You throwin stones? Kick rocks, ready y'all ain't
On my level, I'm one of the thoroughest to ever spit
With +Fire and Desire+ like Rick James, (I'm 'Mega bitch)
Don't ever shit where you sleep or you'll smell a stint
A lot of people sittin in cells from carelessness
Ruin lives and neutralize the tenements
I've been in this shit since B.I.G. was Chris
And Reaganomics enslaved the projects
Niggas had to deal to live
(Deal to live), ya heard me?

[Hook]
