[Intro, sung]
Cause I want you babe
You're always on my mind
Never change
You're always by my side
All I see, is a life of you and me
But you, can't stop fucking with me
Can't stop fucking with me
But you can't stop fucking with me oh oh oh oh
You can't stop fucking with me

[Verse 1: Dessy Hinds]
I met her cruising down on Franklin
While trying to be frank and stack up my Franklins
Like frankly we could skip straight to the Hamptons
No prior asking if my priors happen in a place of Aspen
No matter where we go, I'm sure you'll need that case of Asprin
And time is spaced with fashion we can a medicate and consolidate
Cause at this rate the paper's more popping before the condom breaks
Plus I ain't never met a dollar that never did like me
So every transaction is my action to piece my Pisces
Like wifey, ain't nothing but that presidential roley
Racks and a pack of proseats for when I feel so unholy
You hold me (I hold you) you break me (I smoke you)
Cause ain't no chick could catch up when the Heinz squeezes on soul food

[Hook, sung]
I'll make sure you stay, so you won't leave me again
I lie and pray, forgive me I have sinned
And I would trade, everything I wish for you
Can't stop fucking with me
Can't stop fucking with me
But you can't stop fucking with me oh oh oh oh
You can't stop fucking with me

[Verse 2: Nyck Caution]
I swear to God I swore I'd never need her
Back when I was young my eyes was on that clever diva
My father told me it's important
But don't lose yourself plotting on that extra feature
You ain't sick until you catch that fever
See it was back when I was 17
Trying to find my calling in life
I seen her down the block and shorty started calling me like
"Come and kick it Nyck, we could blow the night away
We could spend time together, life could change right away"
Stop the talking lady, I know you fucking with me
And I ain't fucking with you cause you'll leave me fucking empty
But something always brings me back to the roots
Flashback to your vice grip, you still priceless, priceless

Priceless priceless, priceless (Jared Evan)
