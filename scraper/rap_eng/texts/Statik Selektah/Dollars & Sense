[Intro]
I wanted to propose to you last year
I prepared for this day

[Hook]
Dollars and sense this is it I got
Dollars and sense, dollars and sense
A fugitive with 2 attempts
This is it (ransom)
Dollars and sense this is it I got
Dollars and sense this is it I got
Dollars and sense this is it I got

[Verse 1]
I got no choice but to shed a tear
I ain't seen my baby daughter in several years
You know I'm scared she probably figured I'm leaving here
My baby mama told me she don't even care
You know my fan, she calling another man dad
And now I'm home I got this shit in a dead bag
These niggas mad, don't really give a fuck
I'm on the streets till the jig is up
Until they put my wrist in cuffs
I'm big but I ain't big enough
Yeah I lived but I ain't lived enough
Fuck hat I did I ain't did enough
Fuck what I gave I ain't given up
Stuck in this cage I ain't giving up
Niggas run, niggas thought I was dirt spitting
Cause I was selling drugs gun ripping
I ain't done tripping, I'm back on my bullshit
Them niggas never understood shit
Stay on my hood shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I fell in minus, the third strike I earned stripes
On the block when I serve white the curb life
So go home to your concerned wife
This is where the theme shoot up and burn pipes
Lets learn life I take you on a hell of a trip
We on a strip where niggas hustle and smoke dip
It's so sick yo stomach could do a whole flip
I sold clips to only niggas who roll snitch
So don't trip, Statik gave me this soundtrack
These dark nights describing nigga who found crack
I'm predator to this fake niggas who sound wack
These baby boys will be found dead around back
And that's that, I'm a legend with no name
They told me I'd be a fellon with no fame
But fuck it, I'm here and I ain't going back
Imma die a thug long as you knowing that
This is it, this is it, this is it
This is it, this is it, this is it
