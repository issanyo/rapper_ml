[Verse 1]
Surrounded by all types of stupid things yeah
The only choice there is to make
Might be dumb but it's ok
We're already wasted

[Pre-Hook]
It's unknown
What we may find
So let's get blown
And we'll stay high
And I don't know who set the tone
But like they say, when in Rome

[Hook]
In Rome
(When in Rome)
In Rome oh oh oh
In Rome
(When in Rome)
In Rome oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
We're passing by
So many different scenes
The only road that we should take
Is the one we find in dreams
We've already chased it

[Pre-Hook]
It's unknown
What we may find
So let's get blown
And we'll stay high
And I don't know who set the tone
But like they say, when in Rome

[Hook}


[Verse 3]
Marvelous rap shit nobody could tap in
James Bond mission think that you could be actress
Hallucinating imagery, now everything's plastic
Never took acid what's the Chances of that shit
Intricate, magnificent ill twisted
Ballistic, exquisite yet still lifted
We're out here on a plane that is unexplained
Auto pilot as we float upon this cloud of rain
Just like m e t h o d said what is exactly is a panty raider?
My mind's vapor a skyscraper headed to a land unknown
And all I need besides my crown is my fucking throne
And where my cape is so high not even superman could fake this
We up in spaceships traveling insane
And when we get back nothing is the same

[Hook]
