Verse 1:

My nigga John had obsessed over Benz and McLarens/
Said he would work hard for any car that was foreign/
His little brother Stan needed money for college/
And to his knowledge, he'd see it back in some years and that's how he saw it/
But damn, his little bro in debt for the tuition/
And John needed the grand from Stan but it was missing/
He's gotta get that Convertible Porsche from the dealership/
Cause the deals too good pass and he won't deal with it/
Stan came home for Thanksgiving/
For his mother, avoiding the calls from his brother/
Now they sitting down. across from each other/
While tension rises, Stan sweating from his eyelids/
The kids asking John to pass the butter and the maple/
But he couldn't, he snapped and he flipped over the table/
Everyone panicked, the dogs running in place/
Then John stared at tan and put a gun to his face, he said/

(Hook)

This a motherfucking Stick Up, this motherfucking..
Where my money at Stan? Give me that shit!
I want 100 thou in the motherfucking pocket/
Yeah, Ayo

Verse 2:

Quarter to 9 and I'm hungry for the Pepper Jack/
Stole the cheddar from the rats just to sell it back/
Roaming the streets in the back of the alley ways/
Trynna make a deal but today I'm finna kill/
Got a 22 on my hip with some black gloves and a black mask in a bag full of new clothes/
Swept behind a motherfucker for the cash, told em give me all you've got, I want the watch and the blue coat/
