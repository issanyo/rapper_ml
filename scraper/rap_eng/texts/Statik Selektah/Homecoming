[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm feelin' like I'm destined with the lessons
Spit soon as my effervesence hits
My cash is lessenin' and my gift got me second guessin' it
The struggles do bubble hard through the boiling point
Blowin' steam off for that green
Anoint me with musically lucid dreams that I understand
My mom got another man in her life now
And I finally met the woman that I'm thinkin' I can wife
I want my livin' life, with contradictions, contracts missin'
Feelin' so alive at time to times it's like a nigga hardly livin'
Build infinite school in intuition
But that financial aid be my financial aid to pay my touring expenses
Just on a temporary temper when this kicks in
Into high gear start flowing like liquid and stick shifting
Rhymes that's dripping with mystic misfits
Won't be the only thing that's gettin' sickenin'
When they'll be praisin' the flow like holy water at Christening
Sometimes the vision is crystal clear as well as carat glistenin'
It's just the list of feelings
And sometimes this is what I'm feelin' like

[Bridge]
I'm sayin' thank you everyday for when I didn't see the way
And thank you everyday for just a little "I got paid"
You made my talent shine and reign on the days on the days it rained
Gave me the confidence enough to be with a crew for the game

[Hook]
And for that it's on for life (it's on)
It's on for life (it's on)
It's on for life, me and my niggas on for life (it's on)
It's on for life (it's on)
It's on for life (it's on)
It's on for life, me and my niggas on for life (it's on)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I'm feelin' like I'm on top of the world in just a heartbeat
The way the start weeks becomes too heavy without the light I'm getting from the dark leaf
Practicin' art of no sleep for weeks completely
Chase bank account more like a broke account that's why they chasin' me freely
Think I got it but we ain't make it yet
Cause we from BK where your life is owed to break a debt
And niggas out to break your set
No vacay 'til it's time to vacate with plates on the spaceous Lex
And only if the good book had us sayin' to get laced with checks
Then I be laced with checks from when my first Nikes was laced with checks
And God just had me strugglin' to make it as the greatest emcee
Medic can't defend me without a pen to surrender me
Ain't happenin' long as I'm rappin' in my heart so passionate

[Bridge]
I'm sayin' thank you everyday for when I didn't see the way
And thank you everyday for just a little "I got paid"
You made my talent shine and rain on the days on the days it rained
Gave me the confidence enough to be with a crew for the game

[Hook]
And for that it's on for life (it's on)
It's on for life (it's on)
It's on for life, me and my niggas on for life (it's on)
It's on for life (it's on)
It's on for life (it's on)
It's on for life, me and my niggas on for life (it's on)

[Outro: Dessy Hinds & Joey Bada$$]
I said my crew got my back
My poetry deep
I said my crew got my back
My poetry deep
My poetry deep it never fail
