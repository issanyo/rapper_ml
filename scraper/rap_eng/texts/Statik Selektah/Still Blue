[Intro]
(Turntable scratches)
Thank you very much how's everybody?
Yeah, thank you, thank you appreciate it, (Statik Selektah) appreciate it

Born writer for all of the born writers

[Hook]
It's like novocane, one hit you feel no pain, know now
Back with no refrain, these blues have yet to stain, slow down

[Verse 1: Jared Evan]
Me and Statik some assassins in black we back to kill you
Still Blue. Check the contrast, we got the ill hue
Desaturate the image, put a filter over that shit
The wack shit we back in the kitchen cooking them classics...Bastard
Take a little pop, mix it with hip hop that's what I call boombastic
Fantastic, terrific, you missed it? If you're late it's ok
Just stop look and listen
They thought I'd be wrap by the time I was 24
But now I'm 24, spitting another 24
And the acclaim that I've received, yo there's plenty more
The type of drive most musicians couldn't even afford
So put this album in your tapedeck and let it bang
Once you do you'll be hooked yo, bangarang
I hope it's just enough to thrill you
We leave our mark, that's why we call it still blue

[Hook]
