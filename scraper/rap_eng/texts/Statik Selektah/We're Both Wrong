[Verse 1: Saigon]
How could we have respect for you?
Look what we subjected to
Supposed to serve and protect
You acting all unprofessional
Restraining a man is not grabbing him by his testicles
Sucker getting a gun and a badge and get disrespectful
I'll tell you why this shit is so stressful
'cause we been going through it since we came to America
On a vessel
Pick up a social studies book every time that they mention us
They was even enslaving us, trading us or was lynching us
So what's the big difference?
Whether it's a rope or a scope, the objective is to go out and hit niggas
Speaking this from the heart
I been doing the knowledge
We're seeing that slavery was never truly abolished
They making uzis with dollars they can use for the colleges
What is this?
This is the movement of tricknologists
The only thing we're doing wrong is not fighting back
You ain't got the light to rap but you know what's right and exact, jack

[Hook: Saigon]
How the hell am I wrong?
When your people been doing my people wrong for so long
Now all we got is the hope and the focus to hold on
Y'all been killing us for so long, it can't go on
How we both wrong?

[Verse 2: Termanology]
If they shoot at us, they probably get awarded
If we shoot at them, they popping us when they spot us
It's harder to live life, more conscious and like marauders
And focus on the problem of who could fix it in office
Then picking up a bottle, a bitch, and a couple garcia's
And heading to the crib, to kick it and get some knowledge
Do we want knowledge? And bread for our toddlers?
Saved in accounts or more belts and wallets
And me I'm part of the problem, purchasing gucci products
Before, I put away that money for my daughters collage
And still a great father but times are getting harder
No money for private school, I guess should go harder
Tryna lock in in stability, cuz of my family history
All of them died broke, so I'm tryna be the remedy
Our ghetto kids never inherit no stocks and bonds
That's something to think about
When you putting them Jordan's on

[Hook: Saigon & Termanology]
How the hell am I wrong?
When your people been doing my people wrong for so long
Now all we got is the hope and the focus to hold on
Y'all been killing us for so long, it can't go on
How we both wrong?, damn
