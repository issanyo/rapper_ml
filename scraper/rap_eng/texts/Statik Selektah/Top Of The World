[Verse One] [Gameboi]:
Put me in the game coach
I guarantee that I'm the better person
Want a piece of my mind? here's a second serving
Now-a-days shits weaker and less raw
Check it up, tie up your sneakers and let's ball
The audacity of the dopest dude
Y'all so confused like Waka Flaka up in the voting booth
My sights set all up on them caps and gowns
But still them G's give me daps and pounds
You better ask around
Bet I am the prince, you best to mind your manners
It's on like Donkey Kong, jumping barrels and climbing ladders
I push the button, think my thumb won't slip?
Thinking you big when you little, y'all some jumbo shrimp
Trying to get this, I need only leverage to sever
And seeing someone do it like me is second to never
But still I'm blowing out 16 Candles, John Cusack
I'm international but ain't forget where my roots at

[Hook]:
We on top of the world
Top of the world
We on top of the world
Top of the world

[Verse Two] [Jon Connor]:
What up big dogg, I'm the shit, smell me?
I'll rub your nose in it
Shark in the water, you barely sticking your toes in it
Picture me balling like I took the trophy and posed with it
Determination was the key, look how I opened doors with it
I never stressed, I felt success was always predetermined
Plus I was cold with the flow, felt like a fever burning
I took my lumps and just got up cause there's a need for learning
Some people bump they head once and think they need a surgeon
You want the fast track to fame you missing half the lesson
Them hard times on the grind turn out to be a blessing
Equipped with knowledge, then ain't no need for second guessing
You know the answer before they even ask the question
I never gave it up, barely gave a fuck when hate was on the plate
I just ate it up
They sleeping on you, it's your job to wake them up
Some people stumble and they can't get up
If the shoe was on the other foot would you lace 'em up?
What

[Hook]:
We on top of the world
Top of the world
We on top of the world
Top of the world

[Verse Three] [XV]:
I be state to state like Forest Gump running it for no reason
People following the movement to have something to believe in
See some of y'all niggas hot, but you'll fall before a winner
And I just spring back with something for every season
And my girl got something for every event
But Manolo Blahnik's and condoms all that we needed
Can't tell where my hotel key is, I don't need it
I'll sit in the Chevy dreaming, teachers thinking "Look where he is"
Used to give me F's cause I was next to where the G's is
Alphabet boys, raided my O.G. crib
Now they call me X cause I'm after that W
Upgraded from Double Tree and moved up to that W
From ashy to classy
Bank account knows your name
No wonder I got bad bitches noticing
Now I be cutting like ribbons on grand openings
And skate like a roller rink cause I'mma be on top of the world
