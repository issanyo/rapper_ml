[Verse 1]
I don't mind those who hate on my styles
Plan b, keep you from floating down the Nile
Little bit of lipo, no rhinestones
Cryinh ho, hit hard as diamonds
What do I know? If we all under rainbows, forget bout them zygotes

Jericho and I been breaking these gates
Starving but I've been lifting these plates
No election today but him and his certificate's a debate
Stay where that Ebola stay
Dropping these 808s, so we can all connect these lines
Welcome to heartbreak, I mean, we could all do the time

7 billi, we all could keep it trilly
We all good people, so why we keep assuming?
Let's all take a stand, we all could be winning
Not making any scenes, but that's your decision
