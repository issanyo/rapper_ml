It's one life to live, so live it the best you can
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can

[Verse 1]
Late night grinding, all four seasons
Life is like a party, but I'm working on the weekends
Show you what my dream is
For the whole world to see what we did
Then do it over, remix
Haters all around me like, why we can't be friends
Cause I'm trynna get the win and y'all playing defense
Young freshman, MVP, with a model name liquor when the shots are free
You know me, ain't living life by the cause
Just trynna get what's in store
Before the world don't love me no more
And I cycle, aim on my rifle as the nights go
Blunt with the right smoke, my mind wrote the limit is the sky yo
So I take it everywhere I roam
Philly, New York or Rome, don't know when I'll be home
Age 21, balling and can see those men
Damn, they wanna see us dead

[Hook: Sample]
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can

[Verse 2]
Yo, don't never change, stay the real you
Know how a nigga do in this world
Cause the game is too political
It's cool cause I'm stickin to the same plan
With a whole lot of stacks fuck it I make it rain man
I live my whole life average to blow like magic
Now it's hoes to selektah, the scratches by static
Putting chicks in the cab, rollin sticky with hash
People asking me to get on track, but I laugh
Cause they ain't keepin the essence of understanding
Rollin cohebas with the Son of Sam and
The evil what I be made in
I heard a few shots, coming from convertible tops
Some homies got away, my brother got popped
What a life we live, tip box get guap
Stay fresh my nigga, we gone make it to the top
Smoke trees, get green, fuck a hater talking bout
Hoes down, g's up, waiting for my spot
Be yourself, stay g say fuck the cops
And we ain't smoking if it ain't about the ziplock
So no matter how much these niggas change
I'll always keep it real homie, stay up in your lane

[Hook: Sample]

[Verse 3]
Hey yo, I only got one way to get it
A million ways to spend it
Talk about the hard knock life that I'm living
And I'm chilling, until Statik give me the cue to go
I'm as real as they come, you acting a movie role
Melo hot, see me walking down these ghettos blocks
Sworn to be a king and shit, like Coretto Scott
Nice, try to make it in this life
Cause I bust a lot of moves, so I pray I do it right
Life on tour, I'm just waiting for the mic
These hoes in my hand, they just waiting for the pipe
Right, money get up, the hoes get down
North philly nigga, had to take it out of town
And now I'm in the game, feeling so confident
Your girlfriend on me, yeah that's a robbery
So call the cops, 911, and I be grinding, 9 to 11
With 9 pairs of 11s
