[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, it's Dirty
47 shit, baby
Statik Selektah
Shoutout my nigga, Statik

[Chorus]
No light in the night sky, moon flicker
I flick a star out in space with my middle finger
No matter how big star is ‘cause some bigger
I’m on fire, nigga, I'm on fire, nigga

[Verse 1]
I said it's so sad we live in a world that got us all programmed
I pledge allegiance to no flag
The morticians patiently waiting, ’cause we already got our toes tagged
The rent is getting higher, as well as my hands up: Don't shoot!
Our lands with no roots
Future generations pineal glands with no truth, plans with no moves
They brag with no proof
She wanna be my main squeeze, but got no juice, shorty got no juice
The truth hurts and that's the satisfaction
This is what I need and I ain't even asking
One: I need cash and every pocketful
Two: Blast that PRO ERA 47 loud as possible
Three: That's between you and me and then the .45
Is if you wanna go against the most live, uh

[Refrain]
Heavy thinker, heavy drinker
Yeah, light bearer, no light liquor

[Chorus]
No light in the night sky, moon flicker
I flick a star out in space with my middle finger
No matter how big star is ‘cause some bigger
I'm on fire, nigga, I'm on fire, nigga
No light in the night sky, moon flicker
I flick a star out in space with my middle finger
No matter how big star is ‘cause some bigger
I'm on fire, nigga, I’m on fire, nigga

[Verse 2]
I said, police always wanna search me
Ever since a nigga was like 13 rolling down 13th
Like I’m not a earthling
Nothing can extinguish the fire in me burning, that's why I’m burning
Hot steam, raging against the machine
But it's deeper than music
Trump, I don't think it's amusing
That because of my skin and my race you assume that I’m using
And it landed me in a paddy wagon
Cruising for bruises
Dear school, what ever happened to teaching the students?
It's like these days the kids know way more that you did
Get with the times
Social media got you hypnotized
It done corrupted your mind
We used to be full of gold
Now we full of coal, n***a

[Bridge]
They got you goalless, soulless
They got you goalless, soulless
Ain't nothing nice, n***a
They got you goalless, soulless
Ain't nothing nice
Ain't nothing nice, n***a
Yeah, it's Dirty

[Chorus]
No light in the night sky move flicker
I flick a star out in space with my middle finger
No matter how big stars is the sun bigger
I'm on fire n***a, I'm on fire n***a
No light in the night sky move flicker
I flick a star out in space with my middle finger
No matter how big stars is the sun bigger
I'm on fire

[Verse]
And the man in the mirror finally replied
And said look: you surrounded by winners
But it's just I n***a, it's just I
(yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
No light in the night sky move flicker
I flick a star out in space with my middle finger
No matter how big stars is the sun bigger
I'm on fire n***a, I'm on fire

Heavy thinker, heavy drinker (yeah)
Light bearer no light liquor (nah)
Heavy thinker, heavy drinker (yeah)
Light bearer no light liquor
