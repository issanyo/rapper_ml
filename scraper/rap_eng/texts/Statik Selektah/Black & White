[Hook: Jared Evan]
It’s like
It’s like she don’t even care
She sees me in black and white
Why does she give me that stare
She sees me in black and white

[Verse 1: Jared Evan]
I walk around in this box that she always puts me in
Visions blurred disarray she can’t hear , see or smell
I’m appalled so appalled at the way she looks at me
Why the dirty eye everything she ever did to me

[Hook: Jared Evan]
But she’s color blind
And she never sees my kind
I say she’s color blind
Says she never seen my kind
It’s like
It’s like she don’t even care
She sees me in black and white
Why does she give me that stare
She sees me in black and white

[Verse: Joey BADA$$]
It’s funny how no green bring more blues
And how no pain no gain is so true
But if it wasn’t for some teddy and some betty white
All those plenty nights my machete knife had me delly sliced
To the heart to the torso she cut me like Zorro
Showed no love through fuck like pornos
But according to horoscopes long terms I was too postal
But I feel cupid slipped up with misuse of the crossbow
Cause I swear you perfect I walk a thousand miles
And purchase expensive purses ’cause I swear you fucking worth it
Sometimes I call from private on purpose with no purpose
Just to hear you breathe ’cause I’m too nervous to speak
Your presence is the present and I wish I could be
Present like every fucking day with a present
Swear I be fucking stressing trying to drown a fish for this bitch
Just to get her impression

[Chorus: Jared Evan]
But she’s color blind
And she never sees my kind
I say she’s color blind
Says she never seen my kind
It’s like
It’s like she don’t even care
She sees me in black and white
Why does she give me that stare
She sees me in black and white

[Outro: Jared Evan]
Because we’re all
We’re all in black and white
I said we’re all
We’re all in black and white
Because we’re all
We’re all in black and white tonight
Because we’re all
We’re all in black and white
