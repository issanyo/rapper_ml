[Hook]
I’m coming back to you
I’m coming back to you
I’m coming back to you
God willing, I’m coming back to you

[Verse 1: Rakaa]
Passport, atlas, memories in the stamps
Seat melts to a mattress, visas when we land
Caravans all access, seeing what we can
Foreign hands, foreign cameras hanging out of black vans
We’re gone, live where the bottom of the L
Links the middle of the A from the middle of LA
Riddle wrapped in enigma, the puzzle, who wanna play?
The pressure on, a hair trigger away, away
Surfing through jetstreams, swimming through information
Cannot find the bankers or the politics in nations
Higher than medication, exercise the meditation
I see it’s really all depending on what you have faith in
Killer instinct, savior complex
They here to save the world, but who want test?
Keep it live every second, the time given
Might live with regrets, but I bet I won’t die with them

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Evidence]
Uh, so check it out, this the voice of a thousand shows
Nice to meet you, where you seated? I could see it though
Without a doubt this the only life I’ve ever known
I spit that shit in return, I watch the liars glow
Stand up, we turn it up, just a little more
Superwomen flying in and out of everywhere I go
Different face, same drama, withdrawal
I ain’t leaving 'til I find my high and my setting is low
I’mma cut out the additives
The women I attract, majority weren’t graduates
These are the cards dealt, change the outcome
I ain’t tryna change clothes, I rearranged my game though
Be about some shit, that ain’t me to back [?]
Dilated, day one, we worked the angles
I’m coming back, not ‘til bread is in the basket
Travel with my carry-on, marijuana plastic
