[Verse 1]
What you talkin' 'bout?
Girl, I'm talkin' 'bout you what you talkin' 'bout?
I go figure, put a smile on you, gold fish ya
And baby, you the snack that smiles back
Make a nigga freestyle rap
She make me feel like a heater in the winter
She put a spell on me, Akeelah is the winner
Bee, but I only see you and M-E. S-E-K-S-E-E
See, girl you're so sexy
The last thing about you on my mind be the sex, see?
SÃ­. Make you say yes in spanish
Put rocks on your neck, looking like you're dressed in planets
You the best I never had
You make the sun shine just in case the weather bad
Send smiley face text just in case you're ever sad
And hopefully, one day we can learn to forget the past
Miss Be-a-utiful. Out of every chick that I dig, I love you the most

[Hook: Sample]
Talkin' 'bout you, yo I took you out

[Verse 2]
And baby, you are what this song and this hook about
See, them other niggies preaching money over bitches
But when cupid is the homie, then loving money is senseless
Especially when you already get it then get tired of it
What's the point with no one to spend it with?
I ain't perfect so if anything I'm mentioning
Changes in the future, let me know, baby I'm listening
I'm all ears like Disney AM and if
My pride's too much to say it, I just hope that you remember this
Girl, I love you like Christmas
Your presence is so evidently gifted
John Legend, get lifted
You get me so high I don't need to smoke or sip shit
Girl, you got me feeling like Dr. Lipschitz
If the Pickles can't do it, gotta call the Finsters
Girl your vibe is so instant
I could watch the game later rather replay you instead
She make me feel like the summer breeze
So hot, I think I'mma need me a ton of these
When the winter is coldest, you warm me just like a toaster
You're tasty just like a hostess with honey straight from a bumble bee
And I love my Cheerios, 'cause she's like a healthy heart in a cereal

[Hook: Sample]

[Verse 3]
Even if you had an album, I'll never put you out
Baby you sweet like sugar-betes
And I swear you're the perfect dees-
Wait, straight too hot for T.V
Put your heart in my iPod on repeat
'Cause, baby it's a sweet beat
So tell Bruno, Popeye needs his sweet pea
I swear you're sweet like sweet tea
And me and you is perfect, I'm sure like the sea breeze
I see like the sea shore
And we can cut, but I will never take a detour
Unless it's a you with me tour
Chill at Ikea's while you're picking out decor
I guess it's you and me forever more
And even twenty-twelve couldn't reset the score
I figure there will be several more
I'm only five six, but with you I'm feeling seven four
'Cause my love for you is never short
And my heart will kill them niggies in every sport
I swear we're ballin', we'll tear the court
In half, now it's impossible just to get divorce
I just hope  I marry you
And if I do, then you probably gon' have to carry two

[Hook: Sample]

[Verse 4]
And every time I get home, I'mma cook you out
But that's as far as the future sees
Or the future knows
But I do know that you are such a beauty
And I'm just a beast without you
You're my everything, I'm talkin' 'bout you
