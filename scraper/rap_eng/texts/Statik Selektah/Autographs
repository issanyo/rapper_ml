"Limos, arenas and TV shows
Autograph pictures and classy hoes"

[Verse One]
I scribe my life on border lines before the rhymes
I thought of dime chasin', mind racin'
Off the fine wine agent inauguration
Of a poet
Laureate, my story yet
To meet the apex they say Reks the whole east best
They say that s-t-a-t-i-k
The greatest of the DJs
Producer brother truest in the beautifulest decay
And we say, we took it from the ghettos to arenas
Found our heaven in between us
Seamless scene of dreamers
The team in position, powerful autograph and taking pics
Groupies front row turn to Marriott making flicks
Amazing this in making a matrix is bound to wake to this
The patience is a virtue, burst through the waiting list
Graveshifting it just to make difference
Just to make the distance in us and them significant
From Paris in my cinnamon's lavish living the benefits
Sincerely all keep it one and all on the trips with us

[Verse Two]:
I'm doing rhymes now, bye bye to crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
Doing arenas in Athena and I know you seen us
At every festival, fans put us on pedestals
Packing metal's forgettable when you've mastered a better flow
Of income, and then some, now here come the effin' hoes
I went from ashy to classy
Shorty asked me to sign her double D's overseas
To add these foreigners that we're performing for to our conglomerate
We prominent we jammin' it, profits from the rhyming shit
Shorty it's an honor to be on the dick of someone so notorious
We worshiped as a don of spit
Pondered if I chose another route, bowed out
Took the safer role punch a clock instead of blazing shows
Doubt for the the nonbelievers all I believe is from the ghetto
To the arena, sky's the limit for the big dreamers
Word up

[Verse Three]:
And we our hometown royalty
All you see is the red carpet for the progress
God bless to y'all who stuck with us through the process
Of course it's not all flawless
Evil forces want to see us falter
Separate as we divorce ya
And I don't fault ya
Father forgive him for not feeling the roster
The rawest since Rawkus before it lost its luster
I feel like Busta Leading The New, feeding them food
Even through the meaningless Stat and Reks is meaningful
Breezing through cities the allure and it's all a blur
All occur cause we keep it true, say they seeing you
What's been missing as we sitting on a dynasty
Rap minus me at negative one, honestly
Rap minus Stat, just wack each track crack
East coast can kick you're feet up, cause we back
Straight, No Chaser make those papers for those acres
Build your bucks to break up, let's cake up
Wake up
