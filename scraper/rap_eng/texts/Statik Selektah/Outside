(Sample)
Don't like it on the outside, gotta get on the inside
Won't you let me into your world?
It's cold outside (Jared Evan)

[Verse 1] (Ransom)
Yeah, people say that we in a cold world
I rebuttal and tell em I made her toes curl
Cause she ain't like most girls
She spinning on a slow twirl, understand it?
I play with all my pussies underhanded, that's how I plan it
Wet as Atlantis, splashing paint up on the canvas
I masterpiece and then I vanish, I keep them famished
Give you a taste of what a man is, she go bananas
She bout to flood in front of camera, so call Japan up

[Pre-Hook] (Jared Evan)
Now I'm waiting outside in the cold
There's no point in us trying to love
We could conquer the world if you come
Let's just put it aside till we're numb

[Hook]
Let me see what you got
We could be where we want
You're gonna let me take it from you
I'm traveling to ease my state on mind
Let's finish what's undone

Won't you let me into your world?
It's cold outside so maybe you could
Let me into your world
You got what's mine so maybe you should

[Verse 2] (Ransom)
I been known to be last man standing
Sipping yack while I'm screaming out fuck the world
Let me enter your Grand Canyon
I'm like Viagra, make the water falls like Niagra
My swagger's like a sharp dagger make the sharks scatter
She more flattered when I'm playing with her ozone
Cause me and Jared got that slow tone, flow grown
Vietnam vets will feel the stress up in they broke bones
No matter what the world goes on, hold on

[Hook]
