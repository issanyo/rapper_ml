[Verse 1: Issa Gold]
Everybody want a revolution
With no execution their attempt is fruitless
Tainted souls their necks wrapped in nooses
Steady acting foolish fucking tracks are stupid
I put on for them sacred souls
And on my breaking point my nigga breaking joint
Because the government they only disappoint
With Sarge Ayu unite us like a joint
Holy ligaments mighty filaments
Spitting difference so the world can listen
Souls I'm lifting from the songs I've written
From the dark they drifting now they heart's not missing
Rap is exactly what they talking about
We fucking chalk them out then we walk it out
Its nothing
Geppetto leg on this string they play like puppets
I never hang with the same and fake like Muppets
Back on the road nigga packing these shows
I was dark in the past but the past made me grow
Now my sanity glow with my patented flows
And they draggin' my soul but my heart made me whole
Leading off a new revolution
Pick your poison either way you lose it
Beastcoast we the chosen shooters
Which side you on you better get to choosing
Word to the Flatbush Zombies I Palm Trees
Then I calmly go spastic on these dark beats
To your posse they comfy when I rock me
When I talk heat bring fire to my lord dreams
Golden souls is free can't cross me nigga had no pot to pee
Now I pee green, spittin' holy prophecy the skies in the scene
World democracy lying through they teeth
Fuck the game they all walk the same I pave my own lane
? through the sun rays, sipping Bombay, flow can't be tamed
My nigga pardon me
Kemetic tactics to spread the message
Keep me blessed as I sit through lessons
Guarded hearts, no Smith n' Wesson, just fire souls
Who the fuck they testin? (Heh)

Who the fuck they testin? (x3)

[Verse 2: Ak]
They don't really care about us
It's a big old fight, that's how we end up in the cuffs
Steady witness the light like Phoenix rising from the dust
Everything got a price you got to do it for the love motherfucker
Medicated lungs to the elevated young
To a better state, innovate the future yet to come
Ain't no future in the slums cause we used to shooting guns
So I chose to hit the masses  with the music from the sun
Im a dream chaser leave your faith in manger
You gotta leave money behind stay in your lane bro
Steady, big timin' and puffin potent strains up
Open up your mind fuck being famous
Fuck getting paid if you ain't got no brain
No heart, no goal, no soul, no name
Kick hard flows then the promo came
? fade away with a j i’m a stone cold king
But theres so much to obtain
Like a kid's first steps I crept up in the game
Watch a nigga progress finesse and bring change
With an Indigo second test or get slain
Middle finger to the Feds screaming motherfuck the cops
Young Ak like young Pac same vision different plot
Puff pot till lungs drop, sip elixir 'til I'm knocked
I'm noxious why you dreaming cause I'm sitting at the top bitch
How you gon stop this third eye conscious
Like Itachi make one move and hit the concrete
Y'all raise fools I raise armies
Sacred jewels keep me from harm me scar free
Pay my dues to the beyond me
Serpents lurking like a (?)
Spot me burning like I'm Marley
Hoped the ring and started bombing
Crown the king now call me Kami, darling!
Know my principles no spliffs to roll
You're invisible, it's that simple fool
Whole team rolling crop, that’s literal
When this shit drop, push me to my pinnacle
Living legend ain’t a limit homie I ain’t gone yet
Spreading knowledge through the rhythm and my karma is the check
When the sky falls down it’s time to reflect
Was your life worth living were you god in the flesh?

[Hook 2]
Who the fuck they testin? (x6)
