Different day, same shit

I'll run away from this bitch and never come back if I could" - 50 Cent

[Sha Stimuli]:
Check this out, look
Every 24 is just another chore waking up
Haters wanna war, dodging dummy whores breaking up
Wish I wasn't poor, hope for something more, pray for us
All the stuff I saw, plus endured made me tough
My boy lost his sight chasing cheese
He caught a bullet in his eye, said it really helped him see
Cause the sun doesn't shine, so he finds inner peace
In his dreams and he's out of the dark when he's asleep
Huh
While I'm complaining that
I'm looking at the same shit everyday, I saw him and I took it back
I be chilling in the hood with cats
Wishing that I could offer more than being good at rap
How do you stray from what you're made for or meant to do?
Change starts with a "C" but it begins with you/U
We either staying with our mommas or we waiting for Obama
I don't know what to do
It's the same shit man
