[Verse 1 - Mac Miller]
I got a big bottle of Henny that's gonna get me drunk
I see a couple sluts, they probably gettin fucked
I don't mean to be rude, I like to joke a lot
I keep a butt naked bitch chillin rollin pot
Cause she know I like to party that way
We celebrating like it's my last day
Got a date in life - why you mad, hey?
I do my thing, keep spittin like a bad taste
My competitors can never put an end to me
Even they highly recommend it, I might as well
Be a friend to you
Couple stacks for the night, we gon' spend it up
Dude tryna get it in - he pretend he us!
But you not and never will be homie
In 10 years, my people gonna still be homies
That's the way I like to live life
He knew my name but didn't know the kid was this nice

Groupie love
It's lots of fun
I'm doing my thing, I'm feeling that groupie love

[Verse 2 - Mac Miller]
It's on, shorty says get her home
This feeling I ain't with her, don't wanna be left alone
I fall asleep, she looking all through my phone
Finding all these hoes from all over the globe
That's my business: you could mind your own
I got some money to make, I think it's time to go
You know the deal and the way that you make me feel
Put it down baby girl, keep it real
Traveling I tend to be
Haters probably envy me
Shit I don't pay em no mind: let it be
If you say waddup it's all love
In the club, find a bitch and get my balls rubbed
See, my dudes ain't what you call "thugs"
The future what you call us
That's why we get the whole place going nuts
I'm in the back just relaxing with my drummer
