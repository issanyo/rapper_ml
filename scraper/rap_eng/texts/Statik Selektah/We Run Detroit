[Verse]
Nigga, they call me El Presidente, top brash
Nigga 'cause I spaz, plus I got cash
Plus I pop tags, I got the cops mad
'Cause I'm sick and the Glock got the hot flash
You ain't go no arms, then how can you try to reach me
Being I'm the bomb, I'm probably out of your reach then
Seeing I'm the song that y'all will probably repeat when
Me and microphones is rocking the kind to beast it
My and my cajones can drop and try to keep shit
Locked in the streets with bitches that trying to key shit
Nickel been a beast since niggas was popping peace shit
Wearing polka-dots and rocking Islamic pieces
Why should I compete then? We're living to die
Compare me to a disease, who's sicker than I?
I can tell if he new to the league or if he a star
I developed the unit in G's like 50 and Sha

[Hook]
M.I.C
We run Detroit
Royce 5'9"
I run Detroit
