"Let's start it like this son" - Raekwon 'The Saga Begins'

[Verse One]:
It ain't a secret we the kings of the street shit
Baby blue B fitted in my V6
Statik hit me, told me, "Term you wanna see chips?"
Like a casino man, tell me where to be, shit
You know I'm up in the mix
Pull a Suge move, make you drink a bucket of piss
I stole that line from Joey Crack cause I thought that flow as phat
What happened to rap? I'm confused, someone bring it back
Yo Statik give me a scratch
I'm on fire and you lit up the match
These other cats, man they really no match
I'm Em, you Dre, I'm Guru you Preme
We Billy ?then Slap?
Another legendary two man team
And that's my prediction either way I'm still livin' my dream
I do what I want and say what I like
So all you pussycats stop dressin' in tights

[Verse Two]:
I walk on water and don't get wet
I stroll through a shootout slow and won't get hit
I'm amazing
The immaculate conception
Passin' out drunk, still drivin' while I'm textin'
I know you relate
Used to cut coke on a plate
Cop it up then I sold it in weight
Shout out to Freeway and Jay
Nottz and Asher
Banner and 9th for doin' it right
Them boys from the Banner City
Term and Stat ditty
Got snowed in and made a whole album to get mo' fans
Feelin' like Conan
Poundin' on him till I got swoll' hands
I gave all a chance now they over fam

[Verse Three]:
I came in the game in the underground
So if I remain in the underground
Then I don't care about the younger crowd
Older crowd I'mma do what I want and put it out
