No One Else (Statik Selektah)
No One Else
No One Else, but you, that's giving me

[Verse]
There's nothing like having people support you
You know cause I literally saw, going from the big leagues
And then I had to start over back again
And something that no one else is controlling
Or telling you, you should do this, or you should do that
You know what I mean instead it's just like
I'm doing what's coming from my soul
You know what I mean, I just feel like there's no one else
There's no one other than those people that put you on that platform, It's, it's, that's all it is man and at the end of the day like
That's who I do it for and I know it sounds you know cliche
But things are cliche for a reason because they're true, you know So, I just feel like there's no one else you know?

No One Else (Statik Selektah)
No One Else
No One Else, but you, that's giving me
