"Coming From Queens" *scratching*

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]

Yo
Light the leaf, lay sugar sweet
Inhale the mystic
The three shells by the toilet
I'm futuristic
I'm so ridiculous, my mental sickness-
Women, love a light skinned brown with lots of thickness
A Queen's thing, no shoes in the tatami room
Legs crossed sipping hot sake
Big drugs like a sushi roll
She see the cops, throw the drug up in a poopy hole
Plus she steered the coupe
Eyes shining like diamonds
Smiling like new veneers
Fuck her once, left a souvenir
Plus she take it through the rear door
I watched her change
Now she balling, got a clear floor
Halibut seared off
I'm not impressed though
Cigar full of pesto
Smoking rings, linen from Ernesto
Straight from Queens where it's wise to wear a vest, bro
We blowing up in the world, i'll never let go

[Hook]

"Coming From Queens" *scratching*
It's a Queen's Thing (3x)

[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]

The streets know how I get down
I bang these weaponry
So think "before I let go"
Like Frankie Beverly
Yeah, I creep with your wife, kid
Her brain be heavenly
Dribble on my balls so crazy
Her game need a referee
Come and run to me and complain
Lean my press and squeeze
I hit your frame
Till you're shit stained and wet with pee
I'm a loose shooter
The color of the coupe puter
Stewardess on the dick on a plane to Aruba
Introduced her to the mile high club and scooped her
Told the bitch that I'm the QU Larry Hoover
I run things in the sewers
With flames from the Rugers
Keep heat like saunas
Crimes for the drama
With body armor up under Louis Vuitton farmers
Still trapped in the 80's, Dapper Dan crazy
Tan Mercedes, whip it past the traffic jam, baby
Hundred grand wrapped in rubber bands
Niggas straight cheese
It's me

[Hook]
