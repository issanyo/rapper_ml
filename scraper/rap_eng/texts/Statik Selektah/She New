[Verse: Amar Chong]
Have mercy, I'm sorry to the woman that birthed me
You illest thing to ever walk on the earth see
I could be that nigga, kinda seem like you searchin'
But honestly I ain't the kinda nigga that's perfect
I'm into verses, instrumentals in hearses
And verde, I'm even gettin' lifted on Thursday
I'll be gettin' fried when a nigga is 30
And when we 30 we could kick it and shit
Right now I'm tryna get to a brick
Been dope for a moment, now it's time to give it a kick
I started channelling, with the flick of the wrist
Young nigga gettin' all Q-Tip in this shit
It makes sense, since low end I been flowin' through the rhythms and the paths, but do the math
"Beats Rhymes and Life" didn't drop till 96...
Our "Love Movement" gotta give it a sec
Cupids arrows gettin' hit with a tech, I know the stress
Difference is a nigga writing his life and smokin' sess
With visions of a different life, and no regrets
Where the niggas always covered in ice and cold begets
I'm tryna smoke an L through the night, on a Jet
Could you imagine that? I knew it'd make you laugh
And honestly, that's probably the main reason logically to even fathom after that
Shit matter fact
You're the reason that I know that I'ma get it
I used see the future, and you were kinda in it
And we were kinda chillin', prolly plottin' on some children
I started killin', little Marlen major feelings
A major in the writtens', without a major
A nigga took it to another degree
Name another nigga fuckin' with me, and if he fuckin' bet that nigga still ain't fuckin' with me
You know it's true
Since high school we were somethin' to see, and I ain't even know ya name
I know the pain though
The sky cries we lay with wide eyes and fall asleep upon the rainbow
I know your brain yo
Or maybe all of my assumptions are just fables
Or maybe what I'm really wanting is a raincoat
While it was fallin', it had yet to fall upon you that we shoulda just got lost inside the drain
And she said she knew
She knew
She told me she understood what I have to do
She wanted me to live, till it's time for I do
So she said she knew...
It's okay, I found someone new
