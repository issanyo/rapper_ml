(Scratches)
Ya ya ya-ya, you know the rules to the game (Statik Selektah)
Ya ya ya-ya, you know the rules to the game
Ya ya ya-ya, you know the rules to the game
Ya, you know, ya, you know, ya-ya, ya, you know the rules to the game

[Verse 1: Just Juice]
It could of been economics, though the topic been ebonics
Since I learned to talk, Big L and Pac, my source of knowledge
A force, I'm on it, won't flop, but the shots I'm calling
Captain up in this cockpit, soaring so check the mileage
I'mma ride forever, but my bitch's checking finished
Destined to livin' lavish, and never to set the limit
I'm passion driven, and passing you while you wishing for nice things
That glisten, never sacrifice your vision
My mission to keep it solid got me topping fedda
Fit for Double XL, but I'm set to excell et cetera
Never latest letterman, said I'm great as the veterans
My plethora of rhetorics they persuaded America
To let 'em  enter the game for the sake of betterment
Reel 'em in with hooks  and lines to sink, and settle then
I'm never chilling, till opposition diminished
Opposition at the finish, y'all still at the line of scrimmage

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Just Juice]
You know I'm passionate, craft this quicker than Cassius
Sonny, listen when I'm rapping, I'm spitting like I was rabid
Action in the back of the Acura was  immaculate
She tried to give me lip, I hit her with ejaculate
We sippin' sax and whippin' the ass in-out the sax fit
I'll understand the game, I have to live it lavish
All you want's a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch?!
Don't last to think the last of me turn to ashes
Hands green as yo cabbage, fiesting and never fasting
Living in my means, believe I'm past the average
Back to the matter, it's thinner, my pockets fatter
Cream filled to the seems, like cake and it made me batter
Vernacular, so spectacular, deeper than Excalibur
Featured on any caliber, that of a craft master
After the math, if you shady, you get subtracted
Statik Selektah magic and lace the track with it afterwards
