[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Sheek Louch, yo
Routine shit, wake up, fuck, hit a blunt
Go outside with my pack, see what these niggas want
D Eagle, whip is barely street legal
0 to 60, knocking my nigga Sigel
Hip hop fanatic, your shit pathetic
I'm De La, I'm Kane, I'm Ultramagnetic
Old school and new school, all of y'all can get it
Liquor hangovers, weed medication
New York City, L.O.X federation
Any jail cell, our music is meditation
You don't want my niggas to act up
Cause we ain't moving when I say them boys packing up
I talk shit, but everything I'm backing up
Big money, every day I'm racking up
You can blame us for the hard shit
D Block, box cutters in the yard shit

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Female dogs plus ignorant individuals
Equal bitch niggas, their existence is criminal
I divide fuckboys in half, then live
Multiplied by the fucks that I don't give
You don't possess the grammar to step to Pharoahe's parameter
Trying to take a piece of the pie, or a slice of the ratio
Of a circle circumference to its diameter
Police scan a scrambler, damage your man with a blammer
Feeding Canada, land of the chicks, now get off my dick
Your whole squad's petty, sounds like shit
Whole squad get it down like this, work with me though
The Queens strangler, the rap mangler, danger
The rapper who raps like he should have been born in Jerusalem inside of a manger
Four finger ring rock at the kango
With the headbanger thing hanging out of his pocket, he's not playing
Your topics are not banging

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Nobody rhymes iller than Crooked, I'm Godzilla packing a big gun
This is capital punishment like a cop killer listening to Big Pun
I've got the plug on every drug like auxiliary for the street income
Truly, no lie, my crew be multi
Excuse me, but I'm usually the dude that the foolies don't try
Usually the shooter when the uzi roll by, with the goonies
I put more G's on your neck than a Gucci bow tie nigga
This is what happens when Statik Selektah
Get a rap from Hannibal Lecter, the cannibal predator
How to Kill a Rapper: I'm the manual's editor
Have to respect him, chew him, shit him out a mechanical rectum
Yeah, still getting cash till I pass
Trapped in this industry full of fags and high-class
Hoes, that wanna sit on my lap for a band
Cause they heard I'm moving weight like a gastric bypass
I'mma be fresh as hell if the feds watching
I'mma be getting the best noggin
From a freshly dressed bitch at the edge of my bed with her head bobbing, gobbling
Treating her cheaper than lunch in Red Robin
I'm out-flowing you niggas with quotes, knowing you niggas is jokes, ha
If I really go in, you niggas'll croak
Up shit creek, I'm just throwing you niggas a boat
Rocking dookie chain, showing you niggas the ropes, Crooked
I can keep going
(Blame the, blame the Crooked letter I), the streets know it
