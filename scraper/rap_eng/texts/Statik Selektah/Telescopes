(Hook: J-Alta)
So much shady shit for that green
So I pray we make it, my dream
As I look in the eyes of my chick, I mean
If I ever be king then you gon be queen

(Verse 1: J-Alta)
All the shit we been through, I'm just glad it's been you
Like all the highs and the lows that we been to
Hoping I'm the only one here when I'm in you
Cause if you gone, then who else am I gonna vent to
If I share you my story then I'm gonna share you my glory
Ain't no bond, no connection, nah these other hoes bore me
Plus I'm out here under the impression that you for me
Just fear of the day that you put someone else before me
Lawwwd, if it's already happening
Then let me know, and I'll go get to packing then
Yea but if it's you, this your theme song
Do ya lil walk, lil laugh, get ya lean on
College girl shit, go to class with ya sneaks on
Still dudes looking asking how you got them jeans on
It's funny how they judge cover
Thinking you ain't any deeper than going deep under covers
But they gotta get  close, to see what you see
They gon need telescopes, word, hear me out

(Hook)

(Verse 2: J-Alta)
They don't feel what you feel, they don't see what you see
They don't think how you think, they don't know who you be
All they do is assume, since they don't really know ya
Try to fixate your character it ain't even fair to ya
So you misunderstood, maybe that's why I care for ya
Cause I relate, never had no one there for ya
And you thought you could trust some, but they would lie too
And you thought you could love some, but they wouldn't prize you
Uh, so just know that I got you
If it's you against the world that makes two of us
Ride or die shit, tell me who is true as us
That's why my biggest fear is us ever losing us
And I don't open up often
Due to past mistakes, I make every move with a little caution
Yea, but you with you, I got faith
From bullshit reality, you my escape
Picturing us chilling in the estates
The only thing real in a world of fake
You give me hope, to see what I see
They gon need telescopes, word, hear me out

(Hook)

(Verse 3: J-Alta)
And you don’t feel the scene, you rather just chill
You rather just build on something that could be real
You rather dive in a mind, to see how they just feel
That’s why these hating ass hoes always tryna grill
Oh Yea they tried to tell me, friends saying this and that
But I’m like y’all clueless to be dissing that
Cause me? I done seen all of this and that
That other side they don’t know, you just keep it on the low
Got the Brains beauty yo she got the combination
Freak cause she telling you to go deep with conversations
Shallow ones are scared cause she gives intimidation
Not to mention head amazing, call it mental stimulation damn
Oh my, and that ass so fine
With that intricate design they don’t understand ya mind
I can see you on the grind, dammit you on the grind
It ain’t real, you don’t want it, cause you can’t be wasting time
Word up, uh, she a CEO and nurse
She handling business she leaving other hoes hurt
And I know that you a pro, to see where you going
They gone need Telescopees, shit that’s just real

(Hook)
