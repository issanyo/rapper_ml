[Verse 1: Termanology]
I got suicidal visions of women, I smoke a enemas
Full of venom.  I got ten tenants in ten tenements
Slanging to all the residents. Cocaine intelligence
My snow-bunny bitch sell e-hits for Mexicans
Connecting with the best of the best, and cooking meth
In the bubble bath with two dime chicks and they possessed
I put every finger in your bitch pussy with my rings on
And she don’t give a fuck, she swallow nut and drink cum
Pull up to your house with my hazard lights on, they flashing bright
Hop out with a mask with Armani [slice] and a metal pipe
Throw a little dash of this white inside the Alize
Mix it with some molly and guess I’m top on the interstate
Ventilate the car I’m driving and keeping the doors ajar
Forces are on the floor in case they force us to go to war
Say another word, I’ll run up, ring your doorbell
And lick off like them dirty cops did it to Sean Bell

[Verse 2: Slaine]
I can’t find the words I want to say when I’m trying to right
Having flashbacks of Jack Daniel’s and the china white
Memories of Hennessey. Enemies I find to fight
A dime to light a 40 bag, a shorty who vagina tight
My story, I rewind it ‘cause it serves as a reminder, right?
Or evils that corrupt you ‘fore they cut you in the prime of life
Kind of like that first hit. Left me feeling dynamite
My whip was sharp as shit and you can slip with the katana knife
Behind the mic I’m like a possessed demon, obsessed scheming
This festering pestilence is exiting my chest screaming
The man who stare in his ship is like a hexed heathen
Bent on revenge and he ain’t leaving ‘till he gets even
So now I’m back with the reasons still with a fast temper
The king of everything else, yeah I’m the last emperor
Escaped the grasp of the grim reaper this past winter
But I’m still looking for the next wall to crash into
