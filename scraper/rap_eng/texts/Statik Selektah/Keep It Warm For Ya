[​​Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]

Slammin' man I thought that was heffer was your woah bitch
When you first went to the fed I was that nigga she would smoke with 
And it didn't take long, nigga just left home and she out here on some hoe shit 
Top off the douval, now get started on this dope dick
Took a flight to ATL and I beat that down
Bet you can tell that I was in yo pussy while you laid there rock hard in a cell
Went to catch a flight then sucked me up in this hotel 
Call your freaky friends lets have an orgy I'ma snort some yay
Couldn't overlook it letting you know I was in that pussy

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]

Lil freak bitch, I can't pretend, she got a need then again I was just digging' around she call me a special friend 
Her name Bridgett, late nights we used to kick it, went from freakin' on the weekend and now she missin visits 
You in there eating jack mack and I'm treating her like Kat Stacks smutting her, doggin' her, iPhone record'n her 
Pop wild Rosay bottles, sauce, pourin' up, fuck and take a quick nap with her
Fix me Mac n cheese you know I'm a fat nigga
Heard you got a wind that she fuckin' with a rap nigga--that's me 
You actin' like you own that girl 
DZA a.k.a the reason why your phone calls curve 

[​​Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]

Slammin' man I met yo bitch when I was backstage
On tour with creep gave her this dick now she want my last name
The type of bitch that'll share her chips, I keep that ass trained
She flip the bill while I just lay back on my stash mane
Secret flights and trips to Maui
Pulled them tits out in the Audi
3 G's on lawyer fees gave me commissary in the county
Said she don't let you beat that pussy, stay clean like a whistle
If we get pulled over right now, the bitch gon' take the pistol
Never knew love like this, can't quite see how you love this bitch
She must got perfect pussy, Simple Simon on some sucker shit
She come straight through and bust it bitch
She set that thing out and I took it
She out here lonely and I can't overlook it, I'm in that pussy

[Verse 4: Chace Infinite]

Baby yo' pussy perfect ain't no better way to word it
Make a nigga wanna record it for the world to observe it
So I fuck you like I own it
Bet I keep that pussy squirtin' 
Bet you' ass wake up with shaky legs and feel that in the mornin'
Baby yo' pussy perfect ain't no better way to word it
Make a nigga wanna record it for the world to observe it
So I fuck you like I own it
Bet I keep that pussy squirtin' 
Bet yo' ass wake up with shaky legs and feel that in the mornin'
