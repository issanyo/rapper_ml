[Intro]
All praise is due to God almighty who I honor, worship, and love
The architect of the universe, the creator of all things that exist
God, I need your forgiveness God
Please God forgive me
Not for what I've done, but for what I'm about to do

[Verse 1]
Nothing to eat, pacing the floor
Can't even sleep, sit on the edge of my bed
I'm thinking out loud, tomorrow's got to be better
(Got to be better)
But everything stayed the same
I know who can make it change (Who?)
Me and my P89
Me and my, me and my P89, when Bonnie and Clyde
Are riding together, don't piss them off
Unless you wanna risk it all
Rubbing on her clit 'till my bitch get off
We about to paint another picture of the future soon as the pistol draw
Like a crystal ball, saw it in a vision like click, click, nah, nah
I ain't changing my mind it's time
Fuck that shit I'm starving, fuck that shit I'm hungry in the middle of the hood
I don't give a fuck about a sergeant
I don't give a fuck about a police department
Look at my apartment, a rat took a shit on my carpet
Look out my window, tell me what you see
So many bodies dropping around the clock it's alarming
Armed and dangerous, y'all cops come and harass me if you wanna
This ain't the day for me to be frisked on a corner
I'm a go Christopher Dorner
Death manifesto, let's go psycho, ski mask, rifle
Duct tape, and I got knife that'll slice your life hoe
Give me the weight before the knife go lipo
Wipe your ass off the face of this earth nigga

[Hook]
Cause I ain't got shit out here, facts
That'll make a good nigga go bad
No money, no future, no hope, no nothing man
That'll make a good nigga go bad
Friends? Last nigga I fucked with stabbed me in the back homie
That'll make a good nigga go bad
Job? Look at me, they don't hire niggas who look like me
That'll make a good nigga go bad

[Verse 2]
I'm going bad
Cause a nigga got problems man
That'll make an honest man
Pull out the llamas to go to the promise land
Living in a garbage can
Sick of the drama that come with having no money in my pocket and wallet man
So I've got a Glock in hand
Do I.. got a.. plan?
What the fuck are all you fuck niggas talking about
See that drug dealer down the block?
I'm gonna walk in his house
Tie the nigga up put a sock in his mouth
Then I'll drag him in the bathroom and lock him in that bitch while I'm taking everything that I want in this house
If he lied about the stash then I'm popping him now
Can't believe I'm in a robbery now
Child of God and this should not be allowed
I'm blaming myself, I'm ashamed of myself
I ain't walking around cocky and proud
I ain't walking around with my head up
Cause a nigga got fed up and went and got my bread up
Nigga truth be told, I'm waiting on a setup
Cause everybody know a bitch named karma
And when she come around you better wear your body armor
So what's my faith? I ain't gonna wait on a date
I'm a go hard in the paint with a brand new layup
Young niggas see me in a brand new whip
Now they look at me like steak on a plate

[Hook]
Cause they ain't got shit out here man, no role models, no nothing
That'll make a good nigga go bad
They ain't even got no mentors, who the fuck they gonna look up to? Nobody
That'll make a good nigga go bad
Look around man, everybody gang banging, peer pressure's a bitch
That'll make a good nigga go bad
You ever went three days without eating shit? I'm talking about without eating nothing man
That'll make a good nigga go bad

[Outro]
Since you ate something
