Welcome to Liberty City
The Chase Is On
Catch up, uh

[Verse 1]
Live out of Broker
Time for the close up
But I don’t do warnings
I surprise, like a hold up
Some through warning
I arrive when it slows up
On the stand still
I’m disguised like a poster
They don’t want no such
No pause no cut, No walk on it
It’s the same when it’s opened up
As it was when it was saraned
Too raw to ignore
So I done turned listeners to sands
Given up a hand is the obvi
Aimin’ for AQ
But feelin’ that’s behind me
Meaning that I’m probably
Attractin’ the hate
They’d rather see me in Alderney State
But I’m straight
I take all latin and turned it to all this
And these mothafuckas barely arms length
And I’m all in
So tell ‘em you can count mine
The chase on, I’m about mine
Let’s get it goin’

[Hook]
The chase is on, the chase is on
They chasin’ each other, while I’m chasin’ ones
They chasin’ each other, while I’m chasin’ ones
I get mine before the chase is done, see the chase is on
The chase is on, the chase is on
They chasin’ each other, while I’m chasin’ ones
They chasin’ each other, while I’m chasin’ ones
I get mine before the chase is done, see the chase is on

[Verse 2]
I’m too accustomed to livin’ in my customs
On Touchy Tuesdays
They begged me to touch one
The city is mine and if its not
You couldn’t pay anybody to believe different
Ah, dead real
But still I’m, in it for the Liberty
The blinder’s on
So it’s harder to get to me
You don’t got to signal me
Homie I am cool
Heavy in the trunk
Comin’ Beat 102
When I keeps on the move
No dwindling down
Picture me surrenderin’ now and then delete it
Walk in my shoes
Let’s see if you fit ‘em
Too addicted to chicken palm and drusillas
I’m too much of a star
When I’m in Star Junction
For me to ever wanna go give up this
So, therefore add me to the lead
In the chase, and whatever I need
I’mma take it (you know)

[Hook]
