[Hook: Kendra Foster]
I ain't wasting even a moment
I don't have the time
I ain't wasting even a moment
I don't have the time
I ain't wasting even a moment
I don't have the time
I ain't wasting even a moment
I don't have the time

[Verse 1: Termanology]
Ain't got no time to be, hangin' with y'all now
Built me a label up, can't watch it fall down
Somehow I made it up, up out this small town
Cousin slangin' ron now, never will he calm down
And I ain't tryna judge, I could be right with son
Probably would still be in if I ain't have that time to flush
This story real, not a thing made up
I'm still tryna calm my nerves with a drink, straight up
And I got punch line flows, I got turn up raps
But this album is all jewels, hope you burn these tracks
And if you riding thru the city wit ya burner on lap
I hope this make you think twice, before you murder a cat
Cuz if you sitting in a cell, you won't have nothing but time
To think about how you fucked up and now you losing ya mind
Your reputation and your pride, was a
Show for the audience
Cherish the time you got cuz once you gone there ain't no more of it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Termanology]
Too many hand outs, not enough stand outs
Come in everyday like, help me and my man's out
Too many unloyal, chicks make my blood boil
Knew that was my man and still you went and fucked with him
And I don't rock with people that act brand new
Shake my hand look me in my eye like a man fool
Your handshake ain't matching ya brow
Call me old fashioned but I can't dap you up now
You a character, wow and you actually foul
But I'ma let it go homie we can pass it around
Cuz it's nuff fish in the sea
Spliffs and Hennessy
And I could find another her but she can't find another me
And I'm the type of friend that you won't replace
Treated you like family but still you didn't know ya place
Thought you would've been around forever didn't know you fake
Fuck up out my face, watch me win
Bitch I'm Golden State
