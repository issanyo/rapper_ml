[Chorus]:
"Life is short"
So I'm gettin' money
"Life is short"
Make rainy days sunny
"Life is short"
I'm fillin' duffle bags up
"So I waste it"
"True love"
"Life is short"
So I'm gettin' cheese
"Life is short"
Reppin' that S.T
"Life is short"
I'm feelin' kinda fucked up
"To see me through"

[Verse One]:
[Checkmark]: Money stacked the long way
[Termanology]: Sapphire bombay
[C]: Gin and tonic flow then Geronimo
[T]: All day
[C]: 12 pack of Coors, no Ace Of Spades
[T]: Everyday like the Puerto Rican Day parade
[C]: I got a Eva Mendez
[T]: I got Penelope Cruz
[C]: I got a closet 50 suite
[T]: We can do what it do
[C]: Shawty gettin' mad cause I said I'm leavin' at two
But I ain't gettin' paid to lay down and neither are you
[T]: I'm on tour overseas but I be with the crew
[C]: On the block with gorillas like the street is a zoo
[T]: Got Haze in the jar
[C]: Ridin' round strapped
[T]: Like it came with the car
[C]: Hahahhaha, check out this bizarre
[T]: Scene outta town we get
[C]: Reckless at the bar
[T]: Throwin' green like it's counterfeit
[C]: I'm down to get it now
[T]: No matter the cost
[C]: Let life take it's course homie
[T]: Life is short

[Chorus]:
"Life is short"
So we gettin' money
"Life is short"
Turn rainy days sunny
"Life is short"
We fillin' duffle bags up
"So I waste it"
"True love"
"Life is short"
So I'm gettin' cream
"Life is short"
Duffel Bag Team
"Life is short"
I'm feelin' kinda fucked up
"To see me through"

[Verse Two]:
[T]: Life's short
[C]: But it's the longest thing we'll ever do
[T]: Time is money
[C]: So I'ma spend it with the crew
[T]: I'ma spend it like a Jew
[C]: What you mean? You ain't spendin' it?
[T]: Nah, I'ma be gettin' it
[C]: Rentin' it for benefits? Sounds intricate
[T]: Nah, livin' it up, Cloudy Bay in the cup, Jason Bay for the Bucs
[C]: In the spaceship, fuckin' gettin' face till I bust
[T]: Like what
"To see me through"
[T]: Stainless steel don't rust
[C]: Never in a rush when you fly
[T]: Got the pilots waitin' on us
[C]: Never on the cuff
[T]: I cop it straight up
[C]: Just Throw It In The Bag like Fab
[T]: That's what's up
[C]: I could iron out
[T]: Can't iron my clothes
[C]: Got the iron on the waist
[T]: Einstein when I flow
[C]: I shine
[T]: I glow
[C]: Got a dime on the stroll for sho'
"To see me through"

[Chorus]:
"Life is short"
So we gettin' money
"Life is short"
Turn rainy days sunny
"Life is short"
Stuffin' duffle bags up
"So I waste it"
"True love"
"Life is short"
So I'm gettin' green
"Life is short"
Stop hatin' on my team
"Life is short"
We doin' our thing
"To see me through"
