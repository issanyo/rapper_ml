Introduction (Reks)

Yea, Thats good static, man
You gotta slow that shit down for a second, man
They gotta listen to the words, man

Verse 1 (Reks)

Check
I eat any instrumental
But my sons can’t eat beats, So do I feed the seed or the mental
SUV or the rental. Good job or the lottery
Rental in the hood or beach property

Nothing stopping me, but the man in the mirror staring solemnly
Like the whole world got it out for me
Sorry for thyself like, wealth well will never be a part of me
I give in every artery, but arteries don't clock-in

Arteries just clock-out, grim reaper knocking
The devil won’t get knocked-out, all this cock blocking
I think of Pac and how when, he died in his prime
Like damn, what we need most is time

We dribble or we rush for the first down
Scribble in the verse now
Rhyme the track to remember how it ends, hurt sound
The Earth round, some thought it was flat, will I get credit
When them kids look back
Can I win some?


Chorus (Nas - Book of Rhymes Sample)

I get upset cause I just wanna be treated the way you are
Like a star
Since music's expressions of life
Damn I wish I took more time to write
(Reks "filling my notebook")

(repeat - Once)


Verse 2 (Reks)

Yea, Yea, Check, Yo
Each day that go by
I think about my
Homies in the sky, gotta ask God why
Why you let the love die, why the hate crimes rise

That makes moms eyes water, eyes on the prise
Sized tend apon the concrete
Walking on the lines, with street signs, me crying
Peddlers time settling beef

I'm minding the sheets, rhyming the beats
Trying to reach, for magazines, not the ones for the heat
I'm talking XXL cover expel, brother real educated
Kings spitter, still a street dweller

Do you
Seek hell or heavens halo's?
Hello to demons or the angels
Love I seek, I'm so thankful

Cause god grant you life, to live to the fullest
The devil pull us through gutters, slums killing for colour
Bullets cover the young, slums lost to mothers
Who suffers bodies below, souls rose above us


Chorus (Nas - Book of Rhymes Sample)

I get upset cause I just wanna be treated the way you are
Like a star
Since music's expressions of life
Damn I wish I took more time to write
(Reks "filling my notebook")

(repeat - Once)


Verse 3 (Reks)

We are who we are, we fall, we crawl through it
Gazing at the stars from a far judas
Plotting demise on my rise, my eyes scour the skies
Look for heaven in accumulous clouds beside

My enemies friends can be shady
Fuck a club getting wavy, Shit, I got a baby
My baby's now a toddler, crazy
Holler when I touch down, maybe

24/7 on 'air waves' baby
To follow, be all I can be, motto
Cause i know the trap of the beast, So I avoid
Rap over beats, paranoid like, I should just be employed

A job might do me well
Hobby's no good for bills
Rapping my hobby, Bobby Marley
Had a vision to spread love, I try to rise above
I hate it though, that my niggers can’t make it too

Chorus (Nas - Book of Rhymes Sample)

I get upset cause I just wanna be treated the way you are
Like a star
Since music's expressions of life
Damn I wish I took more time to write
(Reks "filling my notebook")
