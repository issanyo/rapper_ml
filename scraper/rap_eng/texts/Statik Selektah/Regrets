Cherish every single year with you
Kids will understand outta hands, their issue
I care for them, share moments of truth with them
Take them overseas with me I be in the booth with them.
Problem of legacy, any touch a hair on them
Reks going Columbine, postal, fair warning
Give them the facts, so in life they not blindsided
In my raps, see daddy a bit misguided
Forgive me from the gut, from the inside spit
Never left a friend in need, let them bleed or get slighted
The pen aside, its my people that i try to guide
If anything I write, hit a nerve, no apologizing
Crossed every T, dotted every I
On Ps and Qs from my crew steady ride any time
Day and night, 7 a week, 365
Original G, underground certified

Celebrate the life we live
Looking back won't take it back for shit
If I had it all to do over
Give it everything I got, one more shot, no regrets

Give a kiss to my mother, tell my boys I love em
And some brain from a groupie damme touring in London
