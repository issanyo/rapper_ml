[Verse 1: Termanology]
It's swagology, stay pitching like Roy Halladay
Consolidate my money and drugs to pass poverty
The smooth criminal, no mic, move pivotal
Alchemist, Stat on the beat, two generals
I make a lot of cash in a week, move minerals
Never take rappers too deep or too literal
'Cause they be faking with funny imaginations
And conversations, Illuminatis and Masons
The shit I make excite federal agents
Dominicans dealing with dope deportations
The gram chopper, little ice with my cran vodka
Japan shopper, tan copper, I'm the man partner
I fuck with OGs that's corrupted
Looking to fuck shit up bad when they buck shit
Disgusted when I hear ya'll rhyme
And feeling like Pun in his prime

[Verse 2: Reks]
Pull your knuckle back 'til you say uncle to that
No killer but no niggas who hit you with the borat
Not talking Kazakhstan, God I can't stand
Any motherfucker not in my clan
Michael Black san heart
Blast darts that tear apart your ligaments
Termanology, venomous sentences
Infamous sin, Satan, my sentiments been raping the penmanship
Bin Laden your noggin, my slang hit your brain
Like suicide bombing, nothing we doing common
Nothing to like when my brothers write
Not once, twice but three times official
John Doe flow will hit you like rocket sub missles
Motherfucker what's the issue, shut up and rap
Matter of fact just shut your yap
I hate any rapper not on this track
You all suck, you all fuck
A-hole pussyhole vagina rhyming hoes
Closed curtain triple homicide murders what's up

[Verse 3: Willie the Kid]
Pick a time piece, meticulous delicious dinners
Dim the lights, pour some liquor
Bitches lick it off each other
Coffee color furniture from Ralph Lifshitz
Lift your chain like a jewel heist, my heightened senses
Sense danger and since when you niggas dangerous
A shot of Jameson, payments came in envelopes
Vamanos, volleyball bitches naked, body paint
I came to party like Bobby Brown
Never brown nose a vile temper
Nino Brown with the crack vial
And it was G Money vision but then he turned fiend
I dream filthy, I'm from that crowd, my stash crowded
Certain shit I can't allow it, now bow before me
The .40 cal like a moist towelette, disposable
Your Apple tablet in the toilet, I'm disrespectful
Expecting nothing from niggas dependencies foolish
Prepare to burden who you cool with
Bearskin rugs, I wear rugbies and fuck redbones
On red carpet, rug burns and red wine finding parking
I'm at the loft but it's soft like a fresh croissant
Simply my ensemble is something awesome
It's Willie
