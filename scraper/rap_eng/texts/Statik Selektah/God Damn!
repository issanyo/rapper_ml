[Verse One] [Reks]:
In Between The Lines
Powerful rhymes I pen 'em
Then I send 'em to S.T.A.T.I.K. for the Internet leak
I speak sentiments for niggas in the tenements
Those who can't catch na-na-na-na-na
Roadrunner flows, some are feelin' it
Heatin' up your ligaments
A lyricist, more than a little bit, I'm ill-
Literate, illiterate son of a bitch, spit
Considered inconsiderate
Hit you with the one two fist
Or bob and weave, hit 'em with the brrrrrr
Stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em
Props don't give him, cause him rock different
Y'all race neck and neck, Reks in the distance
Far away
I spit further
In between lines commit murder
Third degree burn, verse will relearn, since nursery earn
As I turn foes into urns
Turn enemies to caskets
You don't need to ask if I'm gassed, I'm a showoff, bastards
I go off as if
I'm light switch, nice with a mic stick
Class is in session for rappers
In Between Lines I'm Cassius
Up on the ropes, leave gashes
Stitches
Y'all hit like bitches
Nail marks and scratches
I'll bury asses under canvas
This ain't Kansas
Dorothy, don't walk with me for the answers
My brain, heart, courage here
And I only tell motherfuckers to quit 'cause I care
Nah, I'm lyin' - cause I can
Cause I am
Better between the parallels
Me and Gargamels and you Smurfs better scram
This is In Between The Lines man
God Damn!

[Verse Two] [Freddie Gibbs]:
God Damn!
In the whip with 250 grams
Rollin' with my dude and his wife, she need to get a man
Cause he's sweating like a two dollar hoe in a church pew
Gotta keep my cool 'fore the car gets stopped and searched through
I talked my way to a speeding ticket, got back to dippin'
Left the officer in awe 'cause my English was so efficient
License and my registration legit
We in the van with yams, far as he know we on a family trip
So don't confuse it, I'm fusin' the truth with music
Caught the charges, the battle scars, bumps and bruises
So regardless if I ain't never pumped no units
I ain't never punked out and never lived no illusion
Never fabricate, my fan base just won't allow it
You gravitate to straight fakes, fags, and cowards
A nigga threw me off my game, I highly doubt it
That's like tryin' to throw a rock to the top of the Sears Tower
I'm Backwoods, they Zig Zag
Rappers is riffraff
Niggas be talkin' shit, we shut 'em up with a shit bag
Don't take my city for a joke
I'll lay a nigga on his motherfuckin' back
And get right back to the smoke
Cause Freddie Gibbs claim mo' doe, you dozin' off
Like Tiger Woods played more hoes than holes of golf
It could offend him dependin' how he perceive my rhymes
You'd see the vision if you could read between the lines
I'm on the grind
