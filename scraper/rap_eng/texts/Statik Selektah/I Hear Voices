[Intro]
The world is full of doubters
They don't believe, he's coming again
Statik Selektah

[Hook 1: Statik Selektah (KXNG Crooked)]
Like we always do it this time
I came to shine, I came for mine
This is Slaughterhouse showing off and it's PRhyme
I came to shine, I came for mine
This is Slaughterhouse *scratch fade*
It's Crooked, uh
Statik Selektah, uh
(I hear voices saying that's KXNG Crooked, uh)
East to West coast, uh
(I hear voices saying that's KXNG Crooked)

[Verse 1: KXNG Crooked]
(Here we go!)
Uh, haters saying I'm getting shady money
Now they whisper 'bout how the fuck to take it from me, uh
I keep the craziest pistol, bullets come at you like patriot missiles
I'm Tom Brady money homie
But on the real though, a nigga be trying to chill though
These pussies still acting dildo, digging they own hole
I'd rather slide in a place
With a chick who got a murder case between her thighs
And her waist, an ass you can kill fo' (oh)
That's just my fare fax chick
Hit her on some bare back shit on an air mattress
And my air maxes and gold chain, cold thing
It ain't no love mang
This a fuck affair, that's it baby
Back to my comp, I kill 'em they push up daffodils
My homies in traffic and asking if I'm rapping still
Before I had a deal
I was boxed up in that coupe, like a happy meal
Trying to touch a half a mil
Rest in peace, Half-A-Mil
This shit is so real, to me
You niggas ain't ill, to me
Unless you mention, Pac, Nas,  L and Em, to me
Or Big or Juicy shout out Mtume, man
I wrote down my goals cause I got to reach 'em (yeah)
Then I wrote down 20 different ways that I could achieve 'em (let's go)
And after I did that everything just became clearer
Grab the sharpie marker and wrote, "I'm Unstoppable" on my mirror
You hear me?

[Pre-Hook: KXNG Crooked]
Uh, uh, uh
I hear voices saying, that's KXNG Crooked, uh
(You hear me?)
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, I hear voices saying

[Hook 2: Statik Selektah]
Like we always do it this time
I came to shine, I came for mine
This is Slaughterhouse showing off and its PRhyme (yeah)
I came to shine, I came for mine
This is Slaughterhouse *scratch fade*
It's Crooked, uh

[Verse 2: KXNG Crooked]
Uh, this is really a love story
Cause on the low
Most of my haters got love for me
They know I stay with the guns
Peter and the son Corey
Plus I hang around intelligent hoodlums like a young Nore
But back to my haters
How could they ever disregard
Me doing it this large
I took it from bridge cards
EBT snap, to blowing cigars
Smoke off the balconies in Maui
Y'all got it out for me
But undoubtedly know that shits hard
But still you wanna disrespect, okay
Still I'm gon get the check
Put it in a safe house, this do-rag music with the cape out
I rap over your head and plus I'm on you niggas necks (yes)
Yes lord scratch the Bentley off my vision board
Law of attraction, I simply cut out a picture for it
Then I parked the Arnage, right in my garage
I'm winning against all odds

[Hook 2: Statik Selektah]
Like we always do it this time
I came to shine, I came for mine
This is Slaughterhouse showing off and its PRhyme
I came to shine, I came for mine
This is Slaughterhouse *scratch fade*
It's Crooked, uh, uh

[Outro]
Uh, I hear voices saying that's KXNG Crooked, uh, uh
Uh, uh, I hear voices saying that's KXNG Crooked, uh
(Crooked, uh *fades out*)
