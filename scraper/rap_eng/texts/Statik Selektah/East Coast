[Hook 1]
Fuck who you be or what the fuck
East coast coast
East East coast, East East coast
Squeeze toast, leave most
East coast coast
East East coast, East East coast
Fuck that, yea who dat?
East coast coast
East East coast, East East coast
Squeeze toast, leave most
East coast coast
East east coast, East East coast

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
Yo when Snoop and them was kicking buildings down by your fucking house
Most of y'all was fucking quiet like a church mouse
They had New York New York, We had L.A. L.A
We had the army fatigues, you had the negligee
Ay, you see I rep for my city kid
And even Biggie said he love what my niggas did
Just in case you wanna go and check the record
It wasn't Mobb Deep, that was CNN's record
But them Mob niggas came with us, Trag spit flame with us
Nas said he had our back, then he put our name against us
Yea, It was an East coast victory
It’s not a mystery, this East coast history
We drink champ, drink lager on the beer tip
Now they dressing funny, they on some queer shit
Yea, I’m on some "I don’t even care" shit
Just stay away from me, fuck the weird shit

[Hook 2]
East coast coast
East East coast, East East coast
Squeeze toast, leave most
East coast coast
East East coast, East East coast
Fuck that, bring 'em out
East coast coast
East East coast, East East coast
Squeeze toast, leave most
East coast coast
East east coast, East East coast
Fuck that, bring 'em out

[Verse 2: Lil' Fame]
I’ll take you back to the Source Awards
Suge Knight said come to Death Row, that was way back when
I sit and think about it and wondered how this shit would have went
If me and Bill would’ve went back then
Well fuck that, I’m like the East coast Eazy E
Nigga, the flow is on PCP
You'll get pistol whipped and stripped for your shirt
Your footage on ?? DVD, World Star and VladTV
Fuck that!
A lot of killers in rap over the years though
We ain’t worried about them, they all weirdos
Mic booth gorillas, we don't hear those
Frank Ocean ass niggas, they're all queers, though
Yall ain't fuckin with the kid, Fizz Royal
Half Caribbean kid gone wild
And this is East coast, East coast
Squeeze toast, leave most
In the blood they’re laying in, fuckin with Fame and them
