[Intro: Kid Vishis]
Yeah
Vishis
We're edged in stone
The prince is here
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Kid Vishis]
They call me Kid Vishis
They call me Kid Vishis
They call me Kid Vishis
They call me Kid
The one who made you say "sick 'em"
Made you say "sick 'em"
Made you say "sick 'em"
Made you say
Rock City's prince

We make the rules of rap, so we get paper back
This is royalty, bitch, we're the aristocrats
I'm the prince in fact, we make it count with stacks
Them CDs like crack, give you a dose of that

[Hook: Sample]
"Down, down like a stone"
"Down, down like a stone"

[Kid Vishis]
Nigga
Nah, nigga, we ain't going nowhere
We're edged in stone

[Verse 1: Kid Vishis]
We make the rules of rap, so we get paper back
This is royalty, bitch, we the aristocrats
I'm the prince in fact, we make it count with stacks
Them CDs like crack, get you a dose of that
This is verbal smack, they should sell this in packs
I'm the ultimate connect, I reach the burbs and traps
Vish is the coolest cat, we take the cheese from rats
Call them snitches, take their bitches and don't give them back
Like a thief in the night, I'm in and then out of sight
I move my pen like I'm fighting and I'm trying to K.O. the mic
I spit that yayo, my writing will get you high as a kite
Make you rewind it back twice, admit this nigga is nice
I swing this right, you gon' drop, I will win
You seen that last fight that I was in, friend, aiight then
I'm on some Big L shit, I roll the big L thick
Weed green as the paper that hold the dead presidents
Nigga

[Hook]

[Kid Vishis]
Nah, nigga, we ain't going nowhere
We're edged in stone

[Verse 2: Kid Vishis]
We make the rules of rap, so we get paper back
This is royalty, bitch, we the aristocrats
I'm the prince in fact, we make it count with stacks
Them CDs like crack, get you a dose of that
This is audio dope for all of the artists to smoke
Far from the hardest, I know, still pull the cannon and blow
I rip your heart out your soul and grab my balls like I'm bowling
Never fall, never fold, it's always bros over hoes
My girl's a rockstar, I hate hoes
She's from the hood and she sing better than Keyshia Cole
You can look for sure, no touching from head to toe
You act like you don't know and I will beat you like you stole
Still aiming for global, skills better than local
'Til the wheels is low pro, sitting ill on a Rover
I get a deal, it's over, I'm spitting quotable flows at you
5'9" the king but the young prince is focused too
Nigga

[Hook]

[Kid Vishis]
The motherfucking prince is in the building

[Verse 3: Kid Vishis]
I'm cosigned by 5'9", I know I'm a dope rhymer
So Im'ma just grind, I wrote lines, you quote mines
I make hooks, you take hooks, we could punch it nigga, we can stomp a nigga
But if it's really that serious, we gon' hunt the nigga if I'm furious
So back up real quick 'fore Vishis go off like a
Light switch then dark hits, I black out when I spit
To give you one reminder
I will put a rapper under the ground so far you'll have to find his mic in China
I'll beat you with my fire, I'm the messiah of rhyming
Fuck your tires and your diamonds, I got the eye of the tiger
Just that haters don't like us but they never come to fight us
Before you ask for war, just know you're clashing with the titans
I spaz with I'm writing, four five make him fright and cock back
Release lightning, take that like a burglar
Vishis I'll murder ya, bullets flip your furniture
Feds trying to question me, I say "I never heard of ya"
Loser

[Hook repeats to fading]
