[Sample]:
When we argue
I'd win at any cost
But sometimes I can't help but wonder
If I've won or if I've lost

[Verse One]:
.45 in my hand like an O.G
It's Statik like a '94 Easy Moe Bee
'82 on the track puffin' O.G
Killa killa, my dudes is fo' rilla
"Uh"
Gorilla
"Uh"
Mo' scrilla
"Uh"
Jay-Z to the young O.G. uh
"Uh"
Mathematically I'm more reality
Than a stripper life, silly to make a salary
And I love havin' a popular girl
That's awkward and thorough, she's my mommy on top of the world
It's a triz-a-thon
Lawtown in this bitch
My dudes is gutta gutta we chop it tryin' to get rich
"Uh"
It's the pyramids, dinosaurs, Ice Age
Night K's fight gangs, turn to night flames
Night vision night life, got the nice aim
My Nike Air's the only time that my flight change
Pussy

[Scratch Chorus]:
"1982 the album comin' soon bitch"

[Verse Two]:
It's the Motown version cut down the cursin'
You tend to like the music mo' when you meet me in person
I'll scoop a virgin, drive by the building saying Virgin
Close the curtains this murder so perfect it's a burden
Snatch a purse and return it for most of the insurance
It's endurance insurance, cash reinsurance
So unique we shoppin' at a boutique
I'm so deep that we marchin' up in the street
Hella heat, never falter, defeat
The rawest breed, economy is filled with poverty
Chop a key, pop a key, out for the profit G
1982 they play us in the lottery
So rock poppin', rock choppin', block rockin'
My stock poppin', Xerox stock and chart toppin'
Ology, easy, S.T. crew
ShowOff, ShowOff, 1982

[Scratch Chorus]:
"1982 the album comin' soon bitch"
