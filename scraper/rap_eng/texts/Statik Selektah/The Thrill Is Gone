[Verse 1: Styles P]
I mean you get ya check, I can't knock that
But it's a culture, you can't forget about that

Too many vultures in it (too many)
I think Nas said Hip Hop Is Dead cause he couldn't see the culture in it
Too many funny clothes (too much), too many Auto-Tunes (haha)
Too many gangsters, when they made the Auto Goon (when they made those)
Listen boy you should play your role
Like rap don't need a brand new De La Soul
Pay homage to any MC who paved our road
Or the big Mercedes Benz boy won't get drove
I say that cause, I be where the monsters at
I'm like God damn, they even screwed up conscious rap (God dammit)
I think rap need a new P.E. to +Fight The Power+ and be free (Fight The Power)
And try to bring the light like GE (GE)
I think we deaf, dumb and we blind and for the ten hundredth time
Who give a damn about our swag and our grind? (who give a damn?)
Why don't you rhyme about a thought that you had on your mind
You an MC, let me see, how you really design, ya know?

[Hook:]
"The thrill is gone"
"The shit is pathetic"
"Please forget it"
"Your style is played out"
"The thrill is gone"
"Prepare for this rap killin"
"Ri-Ri-Right?"
"The thrill is gone"
("Let it, let it go")
"Your style is played out"
"The thrill is gone"
"Right?"
"Right?"

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Oh yeah, the thrill is gone
It's been long gone

At once, I'm positive and negative
I'm hyper and I'm calm as a sedative (ah)
The artist, the executive
At once, the son and the father, the comedy and the drama
The fun and the karma, the shame and the honor
The skin under the armor, the bullet that pierce the flesh
The love of life, the fear of death
How it flash before your eyes, when a knife is near your chest
We the best, we the worst, the club or the church
The soap or the dirt, the murder, the birth
At once (yeah), the idol worship sittin in the seaport (uh)
Waitin for a war that ain't ever gon' be fought (no)
The correspondents coverin' this attack on free thought (oh)
Kwe and Styles P we got it covered like three fourths
Time to wake up, Teddy P. said it best when he was in the Blue Notes
I'm the extension of my memories
Hip-hop is in my heart, I keep it closer than my enemies
I bet you they remember me, word

[Hook 2:]
"Right?"
"The thrill is gone"
"The shit is pathetic"
"Please forget it"
"Your style is played out"
"The thrill is gone"
"Prepare for this rap killin"
"Ri-Ri-Right?"
"The thrill is gone"
("Let it go, go, let it go")
"Your style is played out"
"The thrill is gone"
"Ri-Ri-Right?"
"Prepare for this rap killin"
"Right?"

[Verse 3: Styles P]
I think all you need's a beat and a hook (that all)
I need entertainment now, light a blunt and go and read me a book
Why don't you make a dance song? That'll get you a look
BET, MTV, that'll get ya some push
Give it a month or two homie, you'll be hittin the roof
The hip hop heads mad but I'm spittin the truth (it's the truth)
It's the computer age now, better get with the youth (gotta get with 'em)
Don't nobody give a damn of what you spit in the booth
Better make your ringtone, keep your bling on
Sing anything and try to get your sing on
Me I'm just laughin, rollin, rollin
While I'm rollin in a Caddy that's golden
No I ain't a pimp or guerrilla pimp (uh uh)
I'm just a poet that all the killers with
For spittin that realer shit (realer shit)
If we were y'all MC's, most of y'all illegit
