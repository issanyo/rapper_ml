[Verse 1: Termanology]
Thinking 'bout my mistakes
Bought a Jesus piece, diamonds poking out of his face
Should have bought a big safe
Life is just a big race, don't make it a big waste
Trying to chick-chase, but its $600 to sip Ace
She got a thick waste, then your loyalty is misplaced
You chose a fatty over your family, get your shit straight
Talking how you spit great but look in your kid's face
He wants a big cake, but you're worried about your mix tape
A generation confused, skipped paying their dues
Want to be in the shoes of a rapper with jewels
Worry about your kid's school, not your YouTube views
Instagram watching fools, but won't check out the news
The only thing I ever lost and couldn't find was time
So I hate wasting it, especially on some basic shit
Gotta admit, I love a party that's lit and a body that's thick
But sometimes I'd rather sit and...

[Chorus: Scratch x2]
"Take time...
We Should take...
We should take time...
We should take time and think"

[Verse 2: Cane]
Think about it, I linger, then ink it out
While I'm sinking into the bottle, I figured I'd drink it out
They tickle me pink with doubt, I supply a sink in a drought
Gotta bring about change, ain't no time to sit and pout
Them bigots out in a position of power
Grew out a concrete rose, and they're kicking the flower
The bigger the coward, the system get prouder
Give them ammunition, and innocent citizen gets devoured
And due to my skin, I've been given a voucher
And I'm a sinner more than him, but they into the outer
Another name we're singing about but
No Lebron James game, chalk another king with the powder
God he cowers, bodies tower by the hour
Tough to hear, swelling on your ear, cauliflower
Highly doubted that they'll ever understand
When devils make rebels make a plan, take a stand
And the media take a cam, paint it the way that they can
To make it a negative brand, breaking us down to bring in the ends
We're making them win when they see they can buy us
Don't let them guide us through the fires, through their lens they're bias
Now we're OD-ing off of preconceiving notions
Even vegans beefing on us, we perceive it, they control us
I blow this shit down, get higher than falsetto
What I nose grows, so I can't let them be my Geppetto
N-O

[Chorus]
