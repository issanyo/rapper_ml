[Verse One] [Reks]:
Reks favorite pastime
Summertime, barbeque
Roast the pig, killin' 'em
Zip lock, it's a rap, Zimmerman
Focus is, feel the past, Zig Zag mental and
No space to drive, still he I-95
With the liquors and the Eminem cut
To get me thinkin' Psycho
Talkin' baby on the balcony, Michael
My flows the retro
1982, Magic verse the Doctor
Verse, dropped a classic
Herse all your ashes
Either way, heaters spray to bury your asses
Stan to Marshal Mathers
I'm a rich, bitch this Reks, Term and Statik
Nigga With An Attitude, as if
Bastard child, wasn't enough
Now my fuckin' wife leaving me
Trying to have my cake and fuck a couple more repeatedly
I'm criminal, cop killin'
If any of 'em get an itchy trigger feelin'
Mumia, I Abu the pork in 'em

[Verse Two] [Termanology]:
It's
Reks and Ology
Fuckin' these beats sodomy
Solemnly swear, I'mma be slaughtering beats horribly
I'm like a machine
Stomping rappers for they cream
Shattering your mic dream
Slap you out your tight jeans
Me and Reks be rashin'
We some mic fiends
'82 I was born, rhymin' since '93
It's 2012, a bunch of diamond rings later
I'm on an elevator climbing through Saturn's rings
It's 2Pacalypse Now, I'mma firing at jakes
Hopefully I'mma hit him in the head and he fires late
I'm advising fake rappers I annihilate
To run and jet, hide your face, 'fore your body find a lake
The officer visiting, physically disfigurin'
Serial killer mimicin', pillagin' through villages
I'm leaving Nike swishes on your face dummy
Cause you fake dunny and we take money money!
