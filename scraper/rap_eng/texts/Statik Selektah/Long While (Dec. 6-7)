[Verse 1]
It's been a long while, maybe a couple years
She said she loved his dreds, he never cut his hair
He bought her gummy bears, often a pack of Skittles
They're just a couple I felt that I really had to spit for
Got hooked around the Mayweather and Hatton fight
And now they're thinking 'bout spending time in the afterlife
Night after night, fight after fight
And still y'all stayed together since December 6th or 7th
Who cares? Two years is a blessing
And it's Christmas when two of God's children are present
Get it? Christmas and presents
And I bet he still gets chills from her presence
Thrills from a steady relationship is incentive
Never to look past the beauty that is in essence
Couple of adolescents on they way to adulthood
It's all good, love is a beautiful investment
And these days, my a year is so impressive
And y'all did two of those and make a month look like a minute
In a minute, y'all probably gon' break to tears when you notice
That you've spent enough time to buy a year full of seconds
Brush 'em off if they jealous
'Cause the love is in the air and they can smell it
Don't look to the other side
'Cause if the shrubs are knee high when they water the grass
Your grass is greener and your flowers are taller than that
And it all takes teamwork
The only time that Cougar and DDP work
Better together than further apart
I-L-Y, three letters that say words to the heart
Better take it and run with it
'Cause y'all got the type of love another one couldn't
Y'all got the type of bond that bring a two and one with it
The type of ish that many tried and only some could get
But some get it then spoil it and only come to regret
But this is different, I can feel your persistencies
And strong love consist of see, consistencies
You gotta keep at it consistently
The fonder the heart grows the more efficiently
The heart works beating at an efficient speed
And the arteries catch it like a tardy sweep
Pardon me, high school sweetheart-ery
And I'mma give you all of me
That's what she said, then that's what he said
And then me said "take it and run with it
'Cause one wouldn't wanna spoil this one, would it?"

[Verse 2]
You finally found something good that
Would hold you down when them others wouldn't
And one couldn't do unto y'all what y'all could and
Therefore, one shouldn't be able to
And I'm pretty sure you've been through so much
That you probably really came to the point that
Y'all done scored so many times
It'll suck for the referee to have to take the points back
You should never have to point back
Rap faster by the minute to the point that
Y'all got to rewind this just so you could see where my point at
But that's besides the point and that ain't really important
I'm just saying if you cut, let her heart be your Neosporin
Jazmine Sullivan and Wale, you could take a whole world tour in
The fantasy ride of love, bruh it'll never be boring
Let her heart be your storage, take your heart and store it
In her heart, then start it like a car then park it
In her heart again, might as well ride to the end
'Cause it's been a while since
Y'all met each other and might as well not let it go
'Cause what is life without love? Boring
So open up your hardened hearts and let love pour in
I feel emotions building up according
To no dial tone, y'all connect like chord-less
And Superman got his sidekick, sir
It's unbelievable- T-Mobile with perfect service
Why switch when you got the nicest
Mastercard, I'm sure her credit's so priceless
I wish I had something like this
But y'all two give me hope I might find it
If love is blind, then blind it
'Cause blinded eyes could always read between the lines
So sign your name on the dotted line that I am sure you two may find quick
No forged signatures and no fine print
And y'all go together perfectly
Britt and V got a verse from me
Happy anniversary

[Outro: Sample]
I never thought I'd really see you
I'd really see you again
I'd go crazy
