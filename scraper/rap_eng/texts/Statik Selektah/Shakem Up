[Verse 1: B-Real]
Life is all a dream, I used to read High Times Magazine
Rolling joints with Sen Dog up in the limousine
Platinum plaques up on the wall
Every day burn a sack, hey Statik you recall?
Had the stash box in case we got popped
Hitting on a kush joint, green thumb private stock
Stay back or I'm breaking out the gat and I'm [?] with the clap to match
Remember rapping Statik when niggas would let you have it
The skill was crafting bar blasting like an automatic
The days are over [?]
When the game wasn't sold but told, they broke the mold
Rhymes spoke like all caps in the  caption
Thugs scheming, thinking time for some action
Maybe time for some traction, when it's done
Shakem up bitch, I'm about to roll another one

[Hook: B-Real]
Shakem up, shakem up, shakem up
Shakem up, shakem up, wakem up
Shakem up, shakem up
Shakem up, shakem up, wakem up
Shakem up, shakem up, shakem up
Shakem up, shakem up, wakem up
Shakem up, shakem up
Shakem up, shakem up, wakem up

[Verse 2: Everlast]
Once upon a time not long ago
When shawties sipped 40's and puff the hydro
Sometimes I rhyme quick, sometimes I rhyme slow
Ducking 5-0, I'm stealth, I fly low
False flag, black op killers, psychopath cop
Whitey ain't stopped since Wrath of Cane dropped
Make the pain stop, pay the rain maker
All star player, slayer, rhyme sayer
Raining in blood spawned from the mud
God hates you all, here comes another flood
Here comes the next plague
Here comes another omen
Slay the false prophet killed by the Roman
Barbaric like Conan, international zoning
Bio-mechanically stem cell cloning
Supreme tyrannical, you serve the throne
Surgically separate me from the bone

[Hook: B-Real]
Shakem up, shakem up, shakem up
Shakem up, shakem up, wakem up
Shakem up, shakem up
Shakem up, shakem up, wakem up
Shakem up, shakem up, shakem up
Shakem up, shakem up, wakem up
Shakem up, shakem up
Shakem up, shakem up, wakem up
