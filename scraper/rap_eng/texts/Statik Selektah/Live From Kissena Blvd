(Hook)
Ayo I represents Queens
Yea, you already know, come on
You know what time it is
Ayo I represents Queens
Please, let em know
Ayo I represents Queens
Bam bam yea yea uh
Statik
Yo I represents Queens, I prop scenes up
Yea

(Verse 1 - Action Bronson)
Yea the cops set me up, tried to play Action
Good thing I’m like Peyton with the play action
Gold wagon need a diaper cause I’m shitting on em
No lying, engine like a retarded lion
Very special, twist pussy like pretzel
The driver named Fletcher
Sit in the back of the Cadillac stretcher
Maroon dash, air bloom when the platoon blast
Blue grass in the Jag playing jazz
Beige rider glove on my hand
Damn call me Bam Bam Baklava
Sell ten out the minivan like a soccer mom
Back flip out the eight
Doctor Octagon, Aqua Huaraches on
Put the fork in the pasta with the Shiitakes on it
Ain’t a dime, get a move without Papi on it
Green paper, motherfuckers left sloppy for it
Come on, come on

(Hook)

(Verse 2 - Action Bronson)
Throw the left hook, knock a horse out
World came from across town, I put the fork down
Through the knapkin and the dessert disgusted
Lick the mustard, kiss my cousin
Motherfuck you know I do my thing, it’s nothing
Suede patches on the elbow of the jacket
Fodd saver bags for the green crack
Toast to Sesame seeds on the sea bass
Candy skywalker Adidas
Sitting courtside heat jazz
Please, my bitch squeeze at 45 degrees
While I shift the V with Mystique
Kiss on your cheek, go to sleep
I roll the leaf up uh, cut through the block with Queen Latifa
A hundred grand wrapped in a flag of Trinidad
I been a dad, smoke dope, got the same taste as a lemon head
I wanna meet the bitch that invented head
Korean meats laid on a lettuce bed, roll up

(Hook)
