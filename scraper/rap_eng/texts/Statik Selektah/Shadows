[Verse 1: AckurateThaWise]
Paralyzed by predicaments
Of being different
Living like I'm innocent
Doubt within the benefit
Wonder can I finish this
Cold evaluations of my life and what they represent
Kinda twisted when you gifted but you still a victim
Kinda smart but your art is viewed as a dictum
Humiliation is a downfall
The climax of 2nd chances to lost cause
Lyrical surgery, I'm building up this potency
Hopefully I can separate that dark from what I'm pose to be
So you know it's me
Openly a true emcee
Violent by design, but every line is like my eulogy
I pray to God for relief
As I toss and I turn, through these sheets I find peace
So I hold my ground while pick and rolling mixed emotions
Fully focused so I'm hoping you hearing this mental motion

[Verse 2: AckurateThaWise]
They say that life is a vapor
If you practice what you preach then you making the flavor
Can it grow, can it flow, can it make you some acres/
Can it graduate from minor to experience majors
Just a thought that I think while I'm spitting
Hash tagging what's important, while I throw you this mention
Listen, I just envision life right while I'm in position
Black thoughts of what I'm feeling from these split decisions
Inspiration gets lost
While I'm taking off
Crossed by the dark heart
Parts of a bad start
Marks that you can't chart
Pieces of adversity
Certainly, flowing to a portion of my courtesy
Pain comes in any weather
Every cut runs deep, for the better, for the pleasure
So I dance with this pen hand in hand
It's like I'm juggling my fate so these people can understand

[Verse 3: AckurateThaWise]
I'm something more when I'm rapping
Show my passion in every fashion
I'm grasping a tactic while making magic
I spit with mental faction
Lyrical black assassin with fraction of every action
Believing they flabbergasted
On the road that was never traveled me and my shadow
I jot ideas hoping they get unraveled/ write a battle, a story of simple glory
A spiritual inventory
When life that you living is mandatory
You feel it, the mental motion of notions
Within my oceans
I'm focused within commotion
But potent whenever spoken too
Calibrated by ink
Y'all ain't hearing me speak, only hearing me think
