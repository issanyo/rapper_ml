"Listen boy you should play your role" - Styles P 'The Thrill Is Gone'

[Verse One] [Termanology]:
Play your role god, before your face gets stole on
Too many rappers is soft and try to play hard
I hate a rapper that plays an actor
You on the stage trying to capture a crowd that's laughin' at ya
If you real we gon' know that you real
You ain't gotta say it
For entertainment, homie that's real language
Fakes attract fakes, but real recognize real
Rockin' that big chain only gon' get you killed
You weed carriers, gotta know your barriers
Ain't nobody gon' respect you if you talentless
And all you slutty hoes, givin' brothers dome
At every show, it ain't long before your name's known
To be an MC, you really gotta MC
Cause real MC's ain't feelin' all you Lil' Bs
Not the rapper, I mean all you little bitches
This shit is vicious
Cats need to play they role

[Verse Two] [Reks]:
This nigga a crook but he wanna be a rapper
That nigga a rapper, wanna be a crook
Shook nigga swear he thuggin', yeah he buggin'
Listen boy you should play your role, stop frontin'
Gon' pop tryin' to get that buzz and get that dozen plaques labeled platinum
Reks is click clackin' 'em
Half of 'em
Got a bunch of yes men gassin' 'em
Adolph style
And your style to shadow him
Copy cat, copy rap crazes
Poppy act majors but livin' minor them, designer shades is
Askewin' your vision
True isn't in 'em
Vocabulary
Don't have to worry about a Jew you spittin'
Simpleton writtens
I pitch them
Knuckle ball bars with the squad
'82 and I'm truly yours
Hor d'oeuvre, Hor d'oeuvre niggas serve appetite fed
Don't pack pounds nigga
Jenny Craig
