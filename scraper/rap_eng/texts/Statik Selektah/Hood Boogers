[Intro: Your Old Droog]
Check check 1, 2
Listen up 1, 2
Check me out, check me out, yo

[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
From 42nd Street Shuttle to the last stop like Shuttlesworth
Huddle I serve, just might cuddle your Earth
To pass it off to the goonies, sliding off from the hood to the boonies
Leaving rug burns on your boo's knees
Dust bunny, send her home with a stoge and bus money
Chickens, they don't get nothing from me
Only donate to a foundation for cleft lips
And this one chick I nicknamed her coochie Death Grip
Shawty used a loanshark out in Ozone Park
Her mouth was a Woodhaven
I’m slaving, catch me on tour, I’m OT, B
You at OTB, losing your life savings, spending a G
Real calm, I ain't gotta spazz
I stay cool, calm and collected, a lot of cash
If you dumb to come test
I get you buck 50'd by a dyke that look like Mannie Fresh

[Instrumental hook: 8 measures: Chauncy Sherod  yeah's ow's]

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
Vacay in St. Maartens and Arubas
And I still do this for my hood boogers
Who don't know what an Uber is
After Denali, pull up in a sixth series in Cali
Show off like a series finale
Used to take the train home, every day was the warriors
Now I ain't gotta say what my story is
I'm with a Laureates, name went from ringing no bells
Now it's like Nobel's, with dynamite
Shut up, I'm tryna write
It's just like beating on desks in lunch period
Schemes, I got a myriad, the game I'm 'bout to marry it
Still witty, might have been lacking in terms of visibility
But was no doubting his ability
Now that you can see me, you still can't see me
Being rappers is like being girls, they tryna G me
My first show I shoulda put on a mask
Still killed them either way, kept my foot on the gas

[Outro 1: Chauncy Sherod]
I had to learn my own way
Step by step and day by day, ow
I had to learn my own way
Step by step and day by day, ow
No, no, oh
What I'm tryna say dear darling
If you gotta find your own way outta here
There's a lot of hustlers
Lot of pimps
And we just tryna find our way through it baby
Yeah, oh
I had to learn my own way
Step by step and day by day, ow
I had to learn my own way
Step by step and day by day, ow

[Outro 2: Your Old Droog]
It's easy not to be considered a hood booger
Just don't fuck dudes in the same circle, ma, c'mon
Aw, man, your lucky 7's more like a lucky 70 bodies
