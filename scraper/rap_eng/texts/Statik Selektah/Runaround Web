[Intro]
Here's my story, it's sad but true
Yeah right, You see I love women, but I can't pick just one
And like, I'm sure I'll settle down one day
But I'm young, right? I'm just tryn to have a good time
Living in the moment and whatnot, you can call me a dog
But everybody else calls me Chris Webby, hehe nahmean?

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
It's seems like every week I get some girlie's number in my phone
Bring her home, make her scream, make her yell, make her moan
I'm a dog always lookin' for somewhere to put a bone
On my Entourage shit, bitches lookin' like Sloane
I'm an animal, off the chain, I had to cut loose
And judging on how you're dressed, you're tryin to fuck boo
You'll never hear me utterin' about I love you
I just really want to see them panties drop into your Ugg boots
It ain't my fault, your girlfriend sweats me
She'll be gettin' back to you, right after she's left me
And I ain't puttin' rose petals on your bed sheets
Romance ain't my thing, you should've known that when you met me
Am what I am, and I'll be it to my death
Got a thing for brunettes, with tats, and big breasts
So if you at the plate don't worry, who's on deck
Hate the game, not the player, Ma
And then she make me say

[Hook]
Woah oh.. (repeat)

[Verse 2; Chris Webby]
You see my life’s good, where it ought to be
All I gotta do is spit game and slaughter beats
And I know you’ll probably tell your whole sorority
Just don’t expect my phone to answer when you’re callin' me
I’m a son of a gun, check the paternity test
Always chuggin' on a 40 and burnin' the best
Unzipperin' your jeans while you kiss on my neck
Oh you’re a good girl? psh, then it’s on to the next
I like a bad chick, just give her the chance
While I try to figure out how you fit in those pants
Cause I’m partial to any exotic biddie
Lookin' like Mila Kunis in Forgettin' Sarah Marshall
On the road every night, it’s unique
Saw you right across the party and I like what I see
Oh you’re daddy’s little girl? well tonight you a freak
She grab my hand and brought me right upstairs
And then she make me say

[Hook]
