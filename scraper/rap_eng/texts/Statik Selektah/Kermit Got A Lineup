Yeah man, all the homeboys eat butt
If you don't eat butt, then you ain't with us

Too many hoes
So many hoes
Imma' bout to go broke

[Verse 1: Gunther The Traplord]

Young Gunther chillin' in the house
Sittin' on the couch( The Sofa Brah')
I just saw a little mouse
Bout' to throw him out
Listening to Based God
My guns like COD Mods
Mummy in the kitchen
Busy doing weight lifting
(RING RING) The phone rang
It's the homie Rh3al N1qqa and his ho Sam
