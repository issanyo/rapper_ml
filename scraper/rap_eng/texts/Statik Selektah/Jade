[Verse 1]
You ever dealt with a street nigga that took money?
Smell like weed and breathe liquor? Let’s walk honey
Yea I’ve been known to squeeze triggers, I’m more gully
So you should never believe niggas that talk funny
All these bitches adore Sunny
A Bronx tale, Torel hicks Fidel chips
I’m real slick, she never could take a real dick
She still thick, waist thin in the Jada Pinkett, I’m Will Smith
Still in all she minds nigga
‘Cause an ass like that is hard to find nigga
Let me remind, nigga she ain’t goin nowhere
Til it rains in hell, sleech and snow’s dead
It’s so clear, bitches know how it goes here
It’s no tears cuz I ain’t into the cryin games
Am I the same? You damn right, I’m Brian King
Rather be livin in hell for me to die in shame
There ain’t no time for pain

[Verse 2]
Mama talkin monogamy – that ain’t a part of me
But honestly I’m used to these bad bitches menaging me
Photography did like pictures, two nice missus
I write scriptures, you feel it deep like a lobotomy
It’s gotta be just like Christmas, it’s gift givin
With 6 women and slick linen
My sick vision, your bitch grinning
It’s poetry, a freak a bitch just like Jodecy
Remember they didn’t notice me
But now they know it’s me, nobody’s cold as me
At the top of the game it’s where I’m pposed to be
Shawty stylin like she was bowlegged
Told me let me get that money before the hoes get it

[Verse 3]
Angela Basett, got my hands on her asset
So now I’m lafin, her thighs shakin, she vibratin
Get in-between her, legs of Serena
Bad for Sabrina getting head from a Tina... Turner
Used to clean the bullets in my burner
Remember when I used to fuck a bitch you never heard of
But now I’m into actresses, me and Long got her doing tricks up on my mattresses
Accurate, I don’t even care about you square bitches
Dwayne Wade, mad Gav, know I’m here bitches
I’m here bitches
Yea that’s right, get it on and crack it
Robin Thicke, bitches pussies where it’s pull the pad in, let’s make it happen
