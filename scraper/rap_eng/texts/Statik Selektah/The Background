It's alright if I can't stay
Cause you're always on my mind
It's alright if I can't stay
Cause you're always on my mind

[Verse 1]
You're all I know
You're what I call my home
And even though we've fought
We'll never grow a part

[Pre-Hook]
I know if I'm misguided
I'll come right back to you
No one stands for my shit, unless of course it's you

[Hook]
It's alright if I can't stay
Cause you're always on my mind
It's alright if I can't stay
Cause you're always on my mind

[Verse 2]
She used to give me Great Neck
Until I started making paychecks
But now I'm high above the clouds, yet I still think about you on this red eye to LAX yeah that's what she is now
And though I'm gone, I can't help but to think I've missed out
Remember when we were kids now?
The noise we made, it never seemed to be this loud
I'm just trying to make you happy
And we ain't finished no matter where I've been rapping
I've been boroughed underground with these queens on an island just so I can get my stats in what the fuck you think I'm here for? This is something I wasn't even prepared for started over now I'm back in rare form, was just hoping that we could share more

[Pre-Hook]
I know if I'm misguided
I'll come right back to you
No one stands for my shit, unless of course it's you
