Love Is A Feeling That I Love
Love So Much You Never Can't Get Enough
Love Can Be Easy and It Could Get Rough
But No Matter What Happens You Gotta Stay Tough
No Need To Talk
I Been There Done That
Talked Some Girls Yeah Their Ass Was Phat
We Used To Laugh, Talk, Make Jokes, and Chat
And That's That
I Went Through Heartbreaks Yeah My Heart Was Healing
But This Girl Hit My Line Then My Heart Was Beating
Shoulda Known This Hoe Was a Fuckin Demon
Dropped Her Ass, Came Back For The Wrong Reason
Maybe It's That Time Of Season When She Leaving
Tried To Stop My Shine But I Keep On Beamin
She Gave Me Attitudes Yeah I Kept Receivin
Maybe Love... Is Only a Feeling

Verse 2
You Love Them, You Love Him,  You Love Her
You Love So Much You Love When Love Hurts
You Love So Much You Love When Love Cries
Acting So Real But Really You Telling Lies
Never Knew Lies Could Come Personified
In This Love Game You Get Disqualified
I Even Knew How You Like Your Chicken, Fried
Go To Micky Ds, Get Some Fries On The Side
Yup,  I'm Just Tryna Be Real
Y'all Bitches Is Fake So Tell Me What's Real
Yeah...  That's a Tough Ass Question
You Muthafuckas So Fake You Lie At Yo Reflection
I Still Go To Sleep And I Have Sweet Dreams
After I'm Done Getting Serious Like Peek Freens
After I'm Done Cleaning Up The Semen
I Say "Love,  Is Only a Feeling"
