[Intro]
East coast, west coast, fiends overdose
(What goes around come around)
Get the cream with my team then I'm ghost

[Verse 1: B. Real]
Lazy days, crazy haze in my head
And I'm smoking 'til my eyes get red
Thinking about the J's we smoked on the corner as a kid
Playing hit-and-hold, loser takes a hit of the gold
Getting twisted if you missed it as a youth
Blame yourself for your condition, a reflection from the booth
Staying higher than the galaxy far away
Put your fuckin' card away
My nuggets got you lifted, put your jar away
I got the sweetest sour D with some OG
Mix it with some cookies, yeah, the doctor got the remedy
Ayo Statik, I'mma wrap it with some shine papers
Thickest fuckin' joint, they might mistake it for a skyscraper
Exhale, you can smell the smoke, got that tasty shit
You tookie motherfuckers better start off taking baby hits
When I’m on tour keep your hand off my girl
Because you’ll get it from the fuckin’ highest man in the world

[Hook]
East coast, west coast, fiends overdose
Get the cream with my team then I'm ghost

[Verse 2: JFK]
They tell me to black out like nobody’s there
Truth or dare you telling, I can smell it in the air
Easy on the clutch, homie, when you in first gear
Verse clear, open your ears and face your worst fears
Tears rolling down your cheek
Can’t speak trying to keep a chance streak against deep
They Snapchatting, backpacking too many fashions
Kidnapping our passion, tell me what happened
The game distorted, my vocals clean
I’m trying to rise above and be a little different than the local scene
If I had one wish I swear it would be this
Grow old, tell stories and reminisce
I would start over like a Nova on that shoulder
Topped up with the big, old boulders
Let me run until I’m older
See my son until my run was over
Some soldiers and domino darts
Horse playing domino shots
Phenomenal clocks, tell me what we got
Between a rock and hard place, a hard face
A race against time like a car chase, no brakes, second takes
Weapons in your face, know your role, know your place

[Hook] (x4)
