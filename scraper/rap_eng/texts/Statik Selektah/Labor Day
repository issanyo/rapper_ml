[Action Bronson]:
Queens legend, dippin' in a green legend
Bless the mic, more holier than three reverends
You talkin' shit like three rectums
The clique stay connected, my dick stay protected
Dirty bitches, fishy like the squeegee market

[Chase Infinite]:
Chief marksmen
Snipin' at you movin' targets
God's archer
Shootin' at you dark forces
Corporate endorsement
The awkward and awesome
Rebel to the cause
Protecting Allah's fortress

[Wais P]:
Chase said Porsches
Buyin' Van Gogh portraits
Trainin' horses, get it? Trainin' whore's
Pimp shit, clap you like applauses
Boat ride flow make you nauseous
Wais P, retire rappers, Randy Moss shit

[Termanology]:
I'm Jesus Christ in white Forces
My wife gorgeous like Rosario Dawson
I school rappers
I could teach you a couple courses
It's Ology, got eight finger
They all frost bite

[Scram Jones]:
My old rhymes, I just tossed it
I'm talkin' mad dog shit
I'm winnin' but I lost it
Trip over my cordless
I'm drippin' like a faucet
Scram Jones, gettin' dibs
Labor Day, everyday like a bitch with seven kids
I'm cold, get a fridge
I know the snowman, Freddie Gibbs
I'm in the mud like heavy pigs

[Push! Montana]:
I'm gettin' rich but I got nightmares of lockin' in state greens
Spit with B.I.G. and slap box 'Pac in my daydreams
Say I gotta give it up for tryin' to be a legend black
This is that Lil' Wayne, zebra print leggin' rap
This that gap, push your fruit cup melon back
Get a four pack, break 'em down and compressing that

[Freddie Gibbs]:
Jack 'em for a hundred pounds of stress I know he's stressin' that
I throw a couple bows and I go OT with the rest of that
Robber of the year, should put my mask up on the mantle piece
Set some niggas up out in L.A. with some Atlanta freaks
For pussy, power and paper niggas be squeezin' pistols
Just get your doe and get out cause nigga we out to get you
