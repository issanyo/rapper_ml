[Hook]
I’mma give you old school from a new school head
Man, I told you, who gon’ be that dude up next?
Going global, doing what you don’t expect
Who the one? Baby, take a guess, yes, that’s…
I got what you need, I got what you need, need
I got what you need, I got what you need, need

[Verse 1]
I’m heavenly blessed, she said "let’s get heavenly wet"
But I’m too dedicated to melodies, they sending me checks
Music a remedy when my memory be getting stressed
Amateurs got my name in they mouth, yeah, they definitely obsessed
Chilling with Statik Selekt up in the lab making hits
They mad at the fact that these rappers acid like a catheter is
Got co-signs from Cam’Ron, Bow Wow and 50 Cent
Mac Miller, Kweli, and I ain’t even famous yet
But still I remain a threat, and yes I am coming for yours
They ducking for cover like everytime that I run in the door
Need to lock myself and go through every cupboard and drawer
They say I’m ‘bout to pop like this youngin’ had grease in his pores
I see that they fiending for more with every single track I drop
It could be my worst song, but they still say “that track is hot”
I hope you get paralyzed if you ever hate on the movement
There’s not a single kid my age that could do what I’m doing
There’s not a single kid in [?] that could do what I’m doing
They claim they better than me but they rap out [?]
Yeah, you can Twitter talk and pick apart this shit that I’m pursuing
But until you prove it, you losing, you just looking stupid
I swear to God, man, hold up
See I can rap good, but I’m able to murder a hook
And I’m straight from the pits of hell, even a sermon is shook
They say I’m about to get green like I’m giving Kermit the look
And I’mma be here permanently, yeah, I’m ‘bout to erupt
Counting my luck and blessings, down to bust only sessions
Every vocal hot enough to leave [?] melting
Gonna split down the trail mix, I do this every day
No, I ain’t on the guest list, but I’m probably on the stage
Chris Miles, Chris Miles, Chris Miles (Chris Miles)

[Outro]
And if you haven’t heard, my name is Chris Miles
I’m from New York myself
I just wanna thank my man Statik Selektah for having me on this project
Yeah, go
