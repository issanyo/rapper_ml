[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Showoff (Showoff) vs. Everybody

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
This is NY versus whoever, and my verse is said
I'll make shorty remember why I'm first
We've been big forever, Biggie Smalls, Big Pun, Big L
Big ass coat with the feathers inside, shirts with the lumber print
Construction timbs in the summer, take a couple sips
Remove your fronts when that blunt is lit
I come from this, young and dipped
Stumbling through the tunnel hit
Flex spinning while out, niggas get cut and shit
It's nothing, it's New York, you gotta monitor your upper-lip
Or niggas'll hook you the monitors, them rubber grips
Fifths habits sounding like a fourth on October sixth
I roll up three numbers, cut the bank, then throw another lick
My arm's strong, take you on top of the tink
Dubbin' that Armstrong, and [?] where have we gone wrong
We used to let our nuts hang, now my pants fit like Long Johns
Them [?] have plenty of legroom
I had the heat near my caps, like Lebron-bron
Push your hairline back, drama gave me a hard on
Shoot at your feet, had you dancing like Diddy before the Sean John
Put on for my city and lead this song on

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
The epitome of greatness
Stay stiff and my niggas bout to make shift
Patience, fill the rhythms and the cadence
Got no time for hate statements
They try to keep the beast caged in, that's why we raging
Sitting on some heat that could probably melt a glacier
Fireman couldn't woke 'm out in this places
You know the element been wondering where the hell I been
Try to put the fire out, that came back devilish
Feeling like a mouse in the house full of elephants
Niggas run they mouth, but they never dis eloquent
I'm high definit-ely, see you with your bitch, but she represent me
She wanna kick it with the beast coast president
Pocket full of white excellence
Said she try'na jiggy with a couple black menaces
[?] got bars and a got a lock in these sentences
All these bitches jailbreak, keep your guard for hell's sake
Open up your cellgate, cellblock 3-I
See Joe, like G.I. commander and chief
Don't ask me why I be high
More buzzin', more honeys than a beehive
