[Verse 1]
Dope Bitch Slangin
Cadillac swanging
New music banging
I'm hot as the august nights
I would do whats right
We don't give a fuck Where you from
So give 2 fucks of where i'm From
(Slipping and I'm Slidin)
Big pimpin ride ,Gold Range Rover
Luck of the Irish Four leaf clover
Doing many shows the tour is over
From Dallas,Miami,Atlanta and Dover
I am Legend nigga ,Got into the Hall of fame
Where every motherfucker got its name
If you didn't make well, you the one to blame
And don't come over here feeling all shame
You caught me Slippin' and Slidin'
Low rider, i am dirty riding
Get a bad bitch good with the dick riding
Karate chop on your ass ,street fighting
Me and Paul wall are busy Sittin' sideways
I relax on the Sundays
Go back to work on a Monday
I'm gonna do a show on the eastern bay
Please always address me as Mr. K
Free me nigga Tay, do the race like Tay
Shooters with me I keep the AK
Nine year old kid ,I don't care for Lil Tay
My brothers and cousins need a biscuit
Think you can risk it ,bitch I might risk it
You know what your lips get
I'm charged up fuck the bullshit
My enemy, I might dis it
I'm on to the next shit
I ain't trippin on these hoes
Fresher than brand new clothes
I got to do all these shows
And what do they know
They don't know Kamau Jones
