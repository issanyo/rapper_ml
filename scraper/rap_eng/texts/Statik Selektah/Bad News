[Hook]
Baby, baby, I got the blues
Every time you come around said it's bad news
Baby, baby said I can't choose
Every time you come around said it's bad news
Bad news

[Verse 1]
The devil never wanna let go
She always want a riot when I get home
I knew it wasn't something I should try
Now all I do is run and hide
Bitch wanna kill my vibe like that rap song
Only difference when she stops she leave the track on
I knew it wasn't something I should try
Cause everything you do is such a crime

[Hook]
Baby, baby, I got the blues
Every time you come around said it's bad news
Baby, baby said I can't choose
Every time you come around said it's bad news
Bad news

[Verse 2]
When she step in, yo the fight's on
We be sexing even with the lights on
Then we look into each other's eyes
That's when I really start to wonder why
Now she naked tryna get close
But I don't think that I should get close
And I don't need to tell you why
Cause everything you do is such a crime

[Hook]
Baby, baby, I got the blues
Every time you come around said it's bad news
Baby, baby said I can't choose
Every time you come around said it's bad news
Bad news

[Verse 3]
You and I, could never share a last name
We not a good match, more like a bad flame
And it's a damn shame, the fact that we be arguing
And making up fucking each other making it harder when
All we need is peace, can we decrease the beef
Is there a reason while you see me like a evil beast
Equal people see eye to eye when they reach defeat
But you and go back and forth like the music on MTV

[Hook]
Baby, baby, I got the blues
Every time you come around said it's bad news
Baby, baby said I can't choose
Every time you come around said it's bad news
Bad news
