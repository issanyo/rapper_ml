[Verse 1: Josh Rogo]

Everytime I spit some shit
I just feel superior
You should feel inferior, got brand new interior
In the whip, take a sip then we headed to the crib
Make sure my mom ain't home just in case I wanna hit
My presence is a present bitch
Yeah thats word to kanye
Suiting up for my city you should call me Gagne
Beats is on my entree, rappers are the appetizers
Try and get my lyrics through your head like some advertisers
Songs gone' be repeat, like I was down in LA
Trying to be the rookie of the year like Elway
I ain't hidin who I am baby I'm a rapper now, eyes on the prize ain't no way that I'm backin down
They ain't staying relevant, we working like some mexicans
First love? rap game, now we like some veterans
To all these weak rappers trying to say that they are better than
Them, them, and them, My pen like Malkin
You flyer than penguin, I'm looking like a falcon, browsin find us on the web like spidey
We gon' take it to the top its rogo, oz and mikey
