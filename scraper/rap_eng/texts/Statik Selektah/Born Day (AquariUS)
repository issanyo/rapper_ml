[Hook]
I woke up early on my born day, I'm 20, it's a blessing
Yo, 20 is a blessing
I woke up early on my born day, I'm 20, it's a blessing [2x]
Check it out, 20 is a blessing

[Verse 1]
What a nigga to do, nothing to lose
The whole world to gain, coming of age
Mama cut loose my chain, now I'm walking these streets like a gladiator
Mama shoulda kept me cuffed me up to the radiator
Fuck is that bullshit on the radio?
Tell that nigga Ebro, "Please play that flavor"
And I don't really ask for favors, and toot my own horn
And I just really got to say the state of hip-hop ain't been the same since
They brainwashed youths to think we came from a slave ship
Hopped out of the spaceship, decoded the languages and realized
They tryna keep us trapped in the anguish
Flooding the airwaves with all of the same shit
Forgetting what's ancient, they tell us we ain't shit
The only means of getting by is killing our own, left in the tomb
Or even worse, putting it in a song to sing along
And I'm a Hot Nigga, cause where was OG Bobby Johnson
To tell young Shmurda that he has some better options
Don't wanna blame the streets that adopted him, or the doctrine
That got his mind, so boxed up in and I don't judge
But there's no one to blame but us, and that's the truth, but
It's always swept under the rug, and deep down we all wanna be loved
But they got us so blind, we don't wanna be us
And growing up in the slums, the shit is tough, I ain't bulletproof
But full of truth, so shoot 'em up till he deceased
And lined right back on the streets
I hope left enough gold for you to get back on your feet, peace

[Hook:] (x2)
I woke up early on my born day
I'm 20, it's a blessing [2x]
I woke up early on my born day
Im 20, it's a blessing, yo
I woke up early on my born day, uh yea
I woke up early on my born day, yea, check

[Verse 2]
The riches under my soul is full of shit
Kinda like the gist of everything from most of ya lips
You see the cash on the otherside's greener
But nowadays I feel like I walk with a nina
Cause the streets got meaner
Preachers got mad nice and my cousin just passed like
You just swerve in any matter, seconds, minutes, and hours
No time to question the power
Cause any blink could demolish a current
Is it your saga? So I'm honored to be here today
The world is ours, we should celebrate in every way
Spread the knowledge to the youth and tell them when we lay
Six feet, I'm six feet
Standing on my own two, and my own shoulders
It's that deep, shifting to max p's, will I put my ego right
Into the back seat, flowing out my veins
Running tracks like an athlete it's insane
Apex rap-thletics, leave 'em gassed off the aesthetics, yeah

Outro/[Hook]:
