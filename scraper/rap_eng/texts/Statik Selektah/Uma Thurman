[Chorus]
They say if looks could kill, then she might as well be locked in a cage, ooh ooh
And everything she wants she steals, but she will not take my heart away ooh ooh, oh

[Verse 1: Jared Evan]
Criminal, cold as ice, breaking hearts, paralyzed
She's a killer with the black axe
Said she's gunning with the pound for some fat stacks
Ammunition like a navy, monastery, all her samurai's crazy
She lost her soul a long long time ago oh oh oh
I've been searching baby, so you could never call me shady, will you ever be my woman?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Jared Evan]
On the run, through the night
Killing em, it's homicide
She's a villain with the best sex
Uma Thurman she's a killer in a black dress
Now she's looking for her baby
Chopping heads all her weapons are crazy
She ran away a long long time ago oh oh oh
I've been searching baby
So you could never call me shady
Will you ever be my woman?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil Fame of M.O.P.]
It's no alter nor priest, I still kiss the bride
B urn an L before you diss my pride (CONG CONG!)
My guns doofy like Shaq in a Buick (CONG CONG!)
Ya'll think it's just rap in the music
Dirty like a stripper's ass and toes
After shaking her ass for cash in a club then came home
Dirty like a weed farmer who blends weed
Half step and get your ass stampede
Jump out the old El Dorado
Gun man standing around your body like the kid on the Pablo
Escobar we rep shit hard, Brooklyn's behind me
I keep my bride right beside me (CLACK CLACK!)

[Chorus]
