[Intro]
Static fill out the heaven
Fuck around, lay around
Shit done happen to the best

[Verse 1]
You are now witnessing a metamorphosis
Of a narcissist with a bizarre sickness
There's more action on power packing sins
In the Hudson sock is where it starts and ends
We thought narcs who was running in the packs would end
Hop into backyards while the dogs barked at him
In a losing situation thinking I could win
In the long one as my lungs get oxygen
Into my toxic skins spinning, boxes gin grinning
We slug up at rock the tenth inning
I'm â€˜noxious been penning
These spirits that were clear to me
Only here to be a prick I'm six spiritually
Tick tick ticking time bomb when it explodes
Slick Rick shit that I'm on with the next hoe
Ten for the generation new to the old
The fire on my ass the past is brutally cold

[Chorus]
Please allow me to reintroduce myself
Cause I been gone for the longest
All those nights that I spent as a young man dead
I was going for the Tony's
We would live and we die we drink to get high
And that's all that was promised
And it all goes by in the blink of an eye
Yeah it all goes by in a blink

[Verse 2]
Hit the booth like I only got one chance
Rhyming like my laife depended on it
I ain't tryna lose one fan
I'm killing em you open the gun jam
You know I'm a pun fan
I put a rock killers got dumb hands
Hey I'm taking shots with the models and the dots
Off the vodka and the scotch I'm impossible to stop
Hit the gobblers with the Molly and they rob you on the spot
Wave the shotty where you pissing on the potty let it pop
Get it popping in the blink of an eye
Cause you love giving top to that Fetty Wap
But I'm ready to dock
I hope my enemies fire inside the venomous fire
I catcha  shell from 12 gauge shelling and done
I sacrifice virgins I like murders behind sermons
It's my turn and I'm nice right with precise wording
I'm nice verbally nigga Nas apply perfectly
Pull punches and plays no faking the high [?]

[Chorus]
Please allow me to reintroduce myself
Cause I been gone for the longest
All those nights that I spent as a young man dead
I was going for the Tony's
We would live and we die we drink to get high
And that's all that was promised
And it all goes by in the blink of an eye
Yeah it all goes by in a blink

[Verse 3]
Life's fickle mistress finding time's a pimp
Tampas's fugit trick must endure pain to exist
Cause after that the clock stop ticking
Put in the friend rice with General Tso chicken
Storing all these big mugs written on the to go box
You can meet defeat like no socks
Death too incur and the rest is a blur
The apple mill lines wanna get the pussies to burn
Carpe diem getting paid with the PayPal
Get taken like Liam, we get them
James Brown hopping on the helluva show
Dumb line these niggas dirts up Marilyn Monroe
And every song documents my lifespan
Boy is your lifespan decks a your lifestyle
In the future poets and boeings are selling greatness
When you see a shooting star that's me winking at you haters

[Chorus]
Please allow me to reintroduce myself
Cause I been gone for the longest
All those nights that I spent as a young man dead
I was going for the Tony's
We would live and we die we drink to get high
And that's all that was promised
And it all goes by in the blink of an eye
Yeah it all goes by in a blink

[Chorus]
Please allow me to reintroduce myself
Cause I been gone for the longest
All those nights that I spent as a young man dead
I was going for the Tony's
We would live and we die we drink to get high
And that's all that was promised
And it all goes by in the blink of an eye
Yeah it all goes by in a blink

[Outro]
Fuck around lay around
Shit done happen to the best
