[Intro]
Let me stay with you
'Til the morning wakes the night
Just one more night with you
To help me see the light

[Chorus]
How can it be so wrong
When it feels
How can it be so wrong
When it feels

[Verse 1: Jet 2]
Spends all his time trying to be creative
'Cause he was told he would never get her unless he made it
In the city of bright lights
You ain't the right type
Why you rap, you ain't a gangsta, nigga
They will never buy that shit
Which is all he hears from the heart of his peers
While they thinking that he do it 'cause he scared of harder careers
But he ain't
Just living with the fear
That the reality of living without the dreams he love could be real
And I feel yo' pain overall in total
Now he's so unsocial in a world so social
Living for a lady he's waiting to get the chance
To take her and show her his heart
But doesn't take the time to know her
Same story, different song, slipped in the spotlight
Sweating behind the mic, 'cause the light's hot like
Hot ice
And he's just trying to pay the price to show out
While every odd is against him like a blowout
Partners look at him different
In action, he went missing
The closer he's getting to success, the farther it's feeling
Option is to love them through the passion he's been given
So they feel the love through the path that he's living

[Chorus]
(No recognition)

[Verse 2: Jet 2]
Spends all her time working towards her dreams
And she's so optimistic 'cause things ain't what they seem
Grew up slept on, but became a beautiful Queen
So it seems every nigga wants her that she sees
But she cool with the attention, it's part of her aspirations
Which is part of the career, also part of the dream
One day is all she hears from the heart of her peers
And they can't help but admire her every time they see her
But who really understands
She's searching for a man
But they just seem to break her heart
That's a subtle part of her fears
And I feel yo' pain overall in total
Now she's so social in a world so social
Living day to day, all she could really do is pray
That everything works her way
So she's walking by faith
Not sight. And suddenly her path is so bright
She's finally recognized by the star she idolizes
Lost boy gives her his heart and she finds it
Everything fell in place, now it's feeling so surprising
She's so surprised
Who would've thought that by following instinct
All her dreams would arrive
And she's so tough, she was bred to survive
You can see it on the inside from the outside
And there ain't no limit to anything you put your mind
If they tell you it's the sky
Just ask 'em how high, then fly

[Bridge]
And this is no recognition
And this is no recognition
And this is no recognition

[Chorus]
How can it be so wrong
When it feels
How can it be so wrong
When it feels so right
