[Hook: Scratches]
This is the life I choose
And my heart done froze

[Verse 1: Slaine]
When I was grown up, you told me that my family was raw
That my daddy was a sicko, mommy's sanity is off
I tried screaming out for help, she couldn't hear me on the porch
You slammed my head on the sidewalk, teary-eyed I forced
Myself off the ground, acting like it ain't a big deal
Dragging my [?] you ripped the ties off my big-wheel
I was only five and you were older, how's that kid feel?
Learned about some people in this world and what is real
But the years passed, all you kids failed
The hide wasn't there for you when you pig squealed
We moved out our childhoods and we became men
You're the same now, you were the same then
Just the other day I seen you drinking at the bar
Talking shit about your friends while they wasn't there
And you halfway kiss my ass, cause you thinking I'm a star
To make a sideways remind, but I doesn't care
See in [?] is where I guess the leaderships acquired
I built this life with my own steel and I treated it with fire
I can take my wins and losses, but believe that I'm a fighter
I'm a lion - you're a rat, you're a mosquito I'm a spider
So I suppose that I can trust and say it's hard for me to tolerate this shit
But it's just the way you are
So I suppose that I can trust and say it's hard for me to tolerate this shit
But it's just the way you are

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Termanology]
Uh
You a maggot, you a bitch
You a pussy, you a coward
And you beat up your girl the only time you get violent
Seen me on the block when I was a little younger
And you was a little taller, so you was a little stronger
So you tried to rob my chain, put me out my wallet
Till I got a little older and my gun got bullock
Now I'm on a TV screen, chillin' and I'm ballin'
While you locked up everybody fuckin' your baby momma
What a life, 3-6-0, they call it karma
You shot up my momma's house but I was prayin' for your momma
I was raised right, my momma always showed me love
You was the cat in the back of the class that tortured bugs
Fuck the court, no love for the judge or the DA
Ya let the predators go and lock me for some weak yayo
I'm on my IPhone 6 while you're on your pre-paid flip phone
You should kill yourself, here's the pistol
