[Intro: DJ Statik Selektah]
Live and direct from New York City, my name is Statik Selektah, the show-off
This ain't no awards show but we 'bout to win with this cypher
Pro Era, CJ Fly where you at?

[Verse 1: CJ Fly]
Pro Era 47
Go get that Thee Way Eye See It
The shit is out, yeah
Kill 'em Pro's?
Kill 'em? (yeah!)

Ain't never meet
Someone iller than some meat with salmonella
We go in with the flow like salmon in the river
Made so many hits, no Catch 22
Gotta drive to get the cake you old bats better batter up too
We got the mitts to beat you
Go ahead or go long
It's me who ya' killin'
I'm always feeling her up
Love letting me hold the cups, shit get frisky
Up for grabs like ooooo I hear the liquid cat's fishy
We'll just wait till this dogs finish his swimming
Catch it when we catch it threw it at me, a conflict in the kitchen
Palms of fingers itching
Figured out if I'm killing 'em then that's gon make me richer
This money ain't a joke I won't play dumb so I won't get it
A instrumental tempo strings to make it come to spin it
The truth I bent it, the rules I bend it
Taking selfies with fans, we 'pendent
Steal your girl, my crew some fucking bandits
Could you imagine in a year all that my fucking band did?
Fly

[Verse 2: Dessy Hinds]
Yo, if you want it bring your army I'm sure they can't arm me
Send your best to harm me
Lyrical skill with more power than calibres spitting calmly
Revolving promptly 'round Godly spirits
Breaking false seeing mirrors
Spearing one's not on top like the Pyramids sharp appearances
Niggas is fearing the exterior to the interior
Only in fear of the child cause ya'll style's are so inferior
Sick like malaria, and my food for thought rap bacteria
These motherfuckers is suckers screaming but we ain't hearing em
Tearing layers from natures creator
Ain't no debaters exchanging more modulators from vocal style obligators
Hashing brown for that rolling paper
Might just spray the vapor for these rapping respirators I leave on a respirator
Originator for flaming the record like a filet in the oven
Lay these tracks down like a filet in the oven
360 bubbling while ya brain busting
Shit could never add up when my brain summons ya'll rap niggas to the Era chamber dungeon
Whooooooooo!!

[Verse 3: Nyck Caution]
Aye, aye, aye, check, check
When I die I'm prolly lit, I blame the ounce though
Well that's cool, 'cos every body bag got a zip
It's Nyck bitch don't doubt it
I'm lost until I found myself a route in my allowance, pounds upon you cowards
I'm a competitor, no, I'm a come predator
Run through by your spot until you never spot it anymore
Never followed anymore, Twitter swallowed everyone
Really man, you think you gets it popping on that cyber war?
Profit is the object, we never style anymore
Not a child anymore, I'm wild you ain't ready for the fouls I'm exploiting
Vials full of poison that I'm leaking
Better vaccinate your child 'fore I reach him
Pledge to this flag, we don't know no allegiance
Dog eat dog, life's a fucking bitch with no leashes
Everything is repetition for the last month
I got offers, stayed cautious, still Caution
Got offers, stayed cautious, still Caution

[Verse 4: T'nah Apex]
Yes we can, can I kick it? (Yes you can)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can)
And I'm gone, yeah
I don't wanna be the one to hurt your day
But you can't runaway, gonna see what was said at the lat
Solely tuck on bag, for the head, still mercy, not gon' lack
Power lez, how I lack?
Call for the feds but it's not going to add
2 plates 2 place mats
A hard and a light mass
All the mathematics balanced
A love, hey do a Lee
Man it’s what’s to do with me
Never skip the set to let my spirit free...
Think that's gonna stop me?
Fireball of energy so let them come gas me

[Verse 5: A La $ole]
It's Corleone, $wank Rock, Corleone, check
Go get that 'Thee Way I See It', that's the way I see it
Gotta' low sport charm, I Jordan so calm
I'm known to rock a Swank, they call me A la Juwon
With a postmortem flow, gotta' porsche motor flow'
This sour got horsepower, we zoomin' through ya' zone
She got me screwed up, said I'm a tool for nuttin'
She a sex machine fiend with a malfunction
Actin' out, frontin, said a nigga' stuntin'
But I could a dump a new regulation like it's nuttin'
I does it, mean I done did it, crushed it and killed it
We pending out higher suppliers give me pot to skill it
You a small fry, short but walk high
We looking down at you nigga's with a hawk's eye
Dragon niggas out the track when I talk fire
The photo style, turn and roast ya'll
Uh, we livin' your dream and we up in ya region, my nigga's be tryin' to reach ya'
The reason nigga's will never be iller because my niggas are the best
Better get your feet wet
You're swimmin' around when nigga's be creepin'
Dangerously, don't play in the sea, it's plain to see
We take it so you die of thirst, you in a vacant seat
I'm too real, bringing truth to your make believe
We too sick, it's a dozen of us shitting nouns
You should of known that a dime would have hold you down
I faced half an ounce, but never see me stress
I'm old - Oh fuck you nigga's

[Verse 6: Dyemond Lewis]
Ok I really like that
It's the super slackers
The slutty slackers
The slutty slackers slackers it's the slutty sluggy slackers yo
It's the slackers the slutty
Ladi dadi Slacks like to party hard
Hardly ever sober, rolled a fresh pack of Marley's
God golly g, golly g
I am bitch respect it
I get up in her ovaries when I ejected
My words contraceptive
Contact my dealer
Contact detect microphone when I feel her
Uh! A little threaten
My swank is my weapon
I walk with it, verbally assault with it
I spit like Poseidon these flows you get lost in it
Raw

[Verse 7: Swank Master Raw]
Which motherfucker tried to steal my flow?
Eenie meenie miney mo?
Step in, bust a swank through the front do'
Surprise! kicking niggas out the window
Who want protest the real Don Gorgan, push it
Pushin' herb from Kingston out to Brooklyn
Where niggas get tooken
I see you shivering
Check the flavor Swank Master is delivering
Lyrical simile to stimulate your mind
Hypnotize all you people when I hop on to the mic
In fact we do this for boom bap rap
To just keep y'all niggas in check though
To just keep y'all niggas in check though
To just keep y'all niggas in check though
To just keep y'all niggas in check though

[Verse 8: Dirty Sanchez]
Dirty want his money right now
And his credit
I deserve my respect for this shit that I imbedded
I am better than them niggas who pretended that they them niggas
Who be lying to them niggas who be buying they shit (woo!)
Fuck the government that's word to my brother man
From the 5th Flo'
You won't get fed if your mouth is closed
That's something he told me
The 47 Og's running it low key
Ha! I'm still Dirty and I'm still 7:30
My vision is still blurry so picture perfect ain't really certain
Blind bitch baby, does the cover match them curtains?
Still couldn't block my shine
Chakras divrine
33rd degree
Fresh 47 embroidery
Pro Era property, no loitering
Can't say my whole team's eating yet
But I'm cooking up a mess
Where syringes were pressed: dirty kitchen
I'm spillin' all my kids on her dress, Started living what I'm thinking
Decider, we next stop
Stop and then frisk
Slaughtering pigs anybody can get it
We shooting stars, now make a wish
I'm rocking skins like the skins we rocking
Powerpuff smoking on that blossom
We're running the game and this shit is exhausting
But we don't give a fuck cause this shit is awesome
47

[Verse 9: J.A.B]
Sitting in my coffin, still contemplating jumping
Steez told me how to function now we got them niggas bumping
Please say something so we can't them start dumping
Nah , we got them shooter but we rather be penman movers
Moving by the pound
Not a sound when we come around
Why? Cause we move in silence
All my niggas holding down
47 for the crown
But y'all already know, the Pro's suppose to blow
Swank on overlord for you poser Joes
Jocking flows, someone send these sucker niggas out the do'
Please let them know they can't have nothing of what we coming for
Edited etiquette, excellent at this rapping shit
Percs' and hallucinogen got me thinking where to begin
The weed transcends to a darker place where kings live
Let knowledge to the Og's when a legend tell their stories
Got damn what it seem
Feel like it's a dream
Fuck reality my nigga we make it what it seems
Waddup!

[Verse 10: Kirk Knight]
I'm from a place where you'll catch a Pelé
If you bust a slug, it's no love, cops, robbers and thugs
And the ultimatum is what the altar made them when you is young
'Cuz them Crips and Bloods made ya bust guns like, "Dog"
Hold the heat down, my conduction on the street is but a small world
Gotta' eat now, live and direct
God in the flesh, all I see is dollar signs and they in vests
Black man hope, black, hold your chest
She said nothing lasts forever, keep coming back 'hun
Give me hot propulsion to 150 Suns
The image of my mind bring the masterpieces
Make hot feces, I like my plate how I feast it
My theory is is E.M.V.(?), word to my J
My achilles is  livin' in the world where MC's is
Mass affected, Poseidon of rap
I can see it all happened with the raps I spawned
Should of sinned but I guess ya'll walk, give me a glass for the mazel tov
Give me a glass for that mazel tov
And one balled too hard, such a star
The energy I give off I run conEd

[Verse 11: Joey Bada$$]
Guess who's back again
I'm known to make a fucker lose oxygen
Get sparked off in toxic drops of gin
Wait, stop, drop it in, roll over
Is what I told her, don’t play games, I can’t console her
Hand it over to the God like a controller
We overload her, she froze up, it was over
The Pros expose her, her ex propose her
They be like, "You ain't that hot", I know
But they still knock my door asking 'bout Jay Hova
My witness, label me, not the Cohen
I got the sickness, hit this, get fixed with the quickness, right
Another J, J blow like dynamite
The other day, I was poor, dine I might
Had nothing but a empty appetite
Now I live a crazy emcee rapper life
Big tings ah gwan, top shotta
Kill 'em every show, rank's up like Shabba
Mr. Lover flow, hot off the top like lava though
I'm too hot, still skilling the pot
Turn bass metals into gold
They ain't think alchemy before I go
Yummy, let me wrap up my meat then explode
Who am I? The fiery Pro
