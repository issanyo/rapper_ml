"Get your two step cause this record of the year"

[Verse One] [Jakk Frost]:
Now you can call me Jakk Frost, Jakk Freezy or Jakk Money
I've been nice since the days of Steady B and Tat Money
I’m half King Kong half Godzilla
They call me half MC, half drug dealer
Half Prince Purple Rain, half Mike Thriller
Half verse killer, half mic killer
I got that Terminator flow, half man half machine
My arsenal is half hand guns, half machine
My team move like half Seals, half Marines
My drug stash Irish, half white, half green
But I’m trying to stay away from my block ways
But nigga I’m a gun, I’m half Megatron, half Shockwave
AK his face while he's locked in a stockade
High speed chase, bout to bust through the blockade
Sell it to him raw, that's what I call a block aid
30 shot clip for the ass, now that's a Glock aid

[Verse Two] [Freeway]:
North Philly maniac
Rep Philly faithfully
Child of the ghetto, man these wicked streets raised me
On top of that, look at what these wicked streets made of me
I'm in all black got my strap on safety
Burners will blast if you try to replace me
I'm in the hood ducking Cagney and Lacey
I'm on the road trying to find me a Stacey
Dash, swoop her up and take her back where my place be
But she never ever relax where the safe be
She climaxed then she's skating
Me, Frost, Tek, we practice cause and effect
Cause we effect every track Statik is making
It's crazy how your favorite girl is my play thing
She's all mouth but never say things
You dugged her out, get her all kinds of jewelry
But when it comes to me she doesn't get a ring
Nah

[Verse Three] [Tek]:
I pull up in a Shelby
With the young G
First foot out, you see the LV
2G, like the Gucci buckle
Gangster and a gentleman, I rap and I hustle
Plus, I love the block I grew up on
Walk down the same block I drove the Porsche on
Black and yellow diamond no Steeler fan
I live Jet life, move Giant grams
See the wrist, got a B and a wing on it
Every track that I touch, do my thing on it
Plus, little nigga with a complex
Better take me serious like a bomb threat
Yeah, I'm the one that you love to hate
Nigga With an Attitude, N.W.A
In other words that you can understand
Plain and simple I'm a bad bad man
