[Intro:]
Bump, bump
Uh
It's Mellow Music
Lets go

[Chorus:]
Drivin' all through the city
Just to ease my mind (ease my mind)
Yeah
Music blast, windows down
Gives me peace of mind (peace of mind)
Drivin' all through the city
Just to ease my mind (ease my mind)
Music blast, windows down
Gives me piece of mind (peace of mind)

[Verse :]

Drivin' all through the city
About a smooth 45 with my brother beside me
And we 're shooting the breeze
Going through life with no manners
Tryna' make it all click
Like Adam Sandler
I'm a maniac
Dropping 30 tunes in a few months
"I must be loony" he says..
And you're skatin' on em' easy
Like you're Kristi Yamaguchi
Told him "all im tryna' do is just do me"
Ya dig
The pressure's in my brain, tryna' hold on loosely
So hard, finding something that suits me
Tryna' cop some new things, cop a few chains
Big body benz that take up two lanes
Gotta Level up, kicking game like Liu Kang
Break the monotony ,the same routine
Ya feel me right?
Peace of mind, i'm feeling right
Back to reality I took the red pill tonight

[Chorus:]
Drivin' all through the city
Just to ease my mind (ease my mind)
Yeah
Music blast, windows down
Gives me peace of mind (peace of mind)
Drivin' all through the city
Just to ease my mind (ease my mind)
Music blast, windows down
Gives me piece of mind (peace of mind)


[Verse:]
Back then who'da thought?
We'd be living like this
Sky's really the limit
Got me feeling like Chris, Wallace
B-I-G said it best
I'm in the sidelines
But Billy G. got next
Got it locked B, cause my shit be the tightest
I Keep writing, till' my hand get arthritis
Got the game locked in a figure 4
Been real since the day they cut my umbilical chord
And i'm quick with the force
And i'm hip with the whores
Yeah, freaks come and go
I lay it down girl of course
But y'all stressin' me out
I gotta ease my mind
Thats the reason why i'm taking this ride
Listen
Running shit, no Asics
Going back to the basics
This ride got me thinking 'bout changing places
Mindset's changing
Ain't not telling where i'ma go
Feeling like i outgrew shit a long time ago
Take a leap, and i'm yelling geronimo
That leap of faith gets you where you wanna go
KG in finals, baby anything's possible
I'm a beast, i'm exotic
I belong somewhere tropical
But i'm
