[Intro:]
Statik Selektah (Statik Selektah)
We build, we build, we build
Welcome to "Boss-Town"
Statik, Let's go
"B" vs everybody

[Verse 1: Termanology]
M-A double dollar verse everyone to this fetti, come
I'm sailin' the streets of the [?] with this heavy gun in my belly, softly
I rep for the hood so hard I swear they need a statue of me
And I be to these murder Mass. streets in holy matrimony

[Verse 2: Reks]
Mass. is capital versus any who show the balls
To get decapitated, ? faggot faded, then most of ya’ll made it
Labeled the greatest, rated the wolf alone
An upper echelon King, underground wearin' the crown

[Verse 3: Ea$y Money]
Ea$y true to this music, you new niggas clueless
We stickin' to the same script, we just new and improve it
Show off, do it for real, ya'll do it to do it
My crew full of shooters, hit you wit them Rugers, shootin' em through you's

[Verse 4: JFK]
Entitlement, Uh… tell me what that title mean?
Claim you're the champ but can't set a screen
Warm it, I bomb it, I come and I find in my mind
Like a fire that be it, I book it, I like it, the time of the life
Yeah, we killin' everyday

[Hook: Masspile Miles]
Listen (Statik)
If they want it they can come and get that (Statik)
Swear I love my city; I just want a little (Statik)
They see me, they salute me, and they ain't ready for the (Statik)
The "B" vs everybody

[Verse 5: Smoke Bulga]
‘Cause in my city I'mma die legendary, I'm Makaveli
I'm ridin' in a Chevy wit a dezi loaded wit bullets from my brotha belly
The bombs went off at the marathon
But the city's All's ask Big Papi (haha), that's verse everybody, ah

[Verse 6: Chilla Jones]
I stomp a nigga' glass jar screamin' mazel tov
And I keep the fire bottled up like a molotov (Boston)
I got us ya'll, ‘cause niggas remind me of
New Years Eve in Times Square, how they dropped the ball

[Verse 7: Dutch Rebelle]
Yo, Been around the greezy types, fuck a busta nigga
Tryin' to moisturize my paint, ‘cause his chick be like a lusta nigga
Buy the Timbs and Geisha buns, grams stuck in the garter
Go harder than sons and fathers, like Sparta's my armor, martyr

[Verse 8: Millyz]
Yo, this life time fuck me up like Aaliyah movie
Sellin' fishscales, swimmin' in a sea of groupies
Local rapper mad, that's ‘cause he a groupie
'Bout to rape the rap game, I don't need a roofie

Listen
[Hook: Masspike Miles]

[Verse 9: Slaine]
Anything is possible and every thought is like a loaded weapon
Every emotion's a bullet spittin' with no direction
Sip from the chalice, gold in my nurse and a throat infection
Fist full of malice, holdin' the knowledge my road is destined
It's a slippery slope, rope-a-dope and then cold deception
It used to strip me of hope, now I know the lesson
Black gloves, black mask, go and get the shotty
It's me and you, but now it's us against everybody

[Verse 10: Sammy Adams]
In the city, they never love you unless you payin' your dues
I should finish my thank you letters and these IOU’s
From broke vans to buses, percussion that leaves concussions
Boston's boy, I don't need an introduction… Sammy

[Verse 11: Esoteric]
Some will stand, some will kneel, some will sample Clyde Stubblefield
Lookin' for that rugged funky drummer feel, now what the deal?
My tongue's a weapon and my lungs are steel
E-S, ya'll my fictional cats, I give you somethin’ real

[Verse 12: Edo G]
If ya settle it's to bury sons, say ya Hail Mary, done
We on the heavy run, it's Boston versus everyone
Other cities don't deserve the respect, industry must of padded ya check
Boston, [?]-town, Edo G and Statik Selekt

[Hook: Masspike Miles]
