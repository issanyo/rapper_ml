[Intro]
(You know the deal)
Yo
(Liberty City)
(Termanology)
Yo, yo
(Statik Selektah)
(Watch out, no doubt)
(Here in Liberty City)
Yo, ayo

[Verse 1]
My Liberty City people is gettin' busy
Pull a glizzy on yo wizzy and rip around the marital
Some next shit, put a hole in yo' exes
My text is the X, is your stress through your chest, and I
I smoke a kid on Broker Bridge and poke his ribs
My men creep down Lend Street with ten heats
So don't sleep, my crew killas are Drusillas
With two millas, millimeters, and gorillas
I'll threw you up with a cup of ass-whoop, so act tough
Get snuffed, get fucked, get bucked
Who wanna rumble my pistol and leave you humble
Rip a copper out the cruiser and riders went through the jungle
I'm a killer, monster, gorilla
Blonker, you Tonka truck, suck a duck, that's down under
The ground when the pound leave you Katrina drowned
That astounded by my murderous plots I founded
In the city

[Hook]
(Watch out, no doubt)
(People gettin' killed)
(You know the deal)
(Here in Liberty City)
(Word up)
(Watch out, no doubt)
(People gettin' killed)
(You know the deal)
(Here in Liberty City)

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I hit hundreds in my gun inside of my other hand
Holdin' a gun in it, runnin' and duckin' front of government
While I'm on the coke, I rob me a stop, loco
With my toaster oven, Broker, you get close to the card
I rode with my squad, it's open his jaws, I cope with the alls
Treatment for killin' the cops and wife nieces
Pieces and pieces of peoples and feces
Police is the beast, never seen some releases
Police try to get me, but I duck in front of they ride
I capitalize on Capitol Hills, natural vibes, passin' with lies
I rationalize my psychopathical guys of mine's, layin' mines and bowties
I shoot you, a bazookas, twos, and dirty shooters
I'm movin' cooch and deflect the po' cruises
The ruggedest boost, I move and guns shoot ya
1982, the album comin' soon, bitch

[Hook]
(Watch out, no doubt)
(People gettin' killed)
(You know the deal)
(Here in Liberty City)
(Watch out, no doubt)
(People gettin' killed)
(You know the deal)
