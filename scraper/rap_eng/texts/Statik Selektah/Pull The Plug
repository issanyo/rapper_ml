Cool, cause I don't get upset
Cool, cause I don't get upset
Cool, cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Picture this: I scare every nemesis off the premises
My business is to killing these tracks and leaving no witnesses
I'm old school, I still know the codes for my Sega Genesis
I stay on my job now the bitches giving me benefits
My rhymes been official, that's why I've been official
Don't send shots at the kid, y'all better send a missile
I'm fearless, class by myself - you can say I'm peerless
I'm my only competition, so I stay away from mirrors
See my reflection's that infection there ain't no cure for
You will endure more
I spit that crack like it's in pure form
You see me buzzin' I'm in full swarm
I hear you loud and clear but it's like you talking bullshit on a bullhorn
They got hate in their heart, I'ma take them apart
These bloodsuckers, I be yelling "Fuck 'em," they get wood and stakes through the heart
I draw my own conclusion, y'all be tracing the art
Born in the jungle, know how to embrace when I'm faced with a snake or a shark
Best in the world I'ma give myself all the credit
They wanted a murder verse, I'm the weapon Statik selected nigga

[Verse 2: JFK]
This is back to the lab, pushing packs in the cabs
Scars to scab, life'll throw you blows and hard jabs
Bar tabs, dash don't smash cause life moves fast
If you ask me, only if you ask
Leave you blind, gathering time, shatter your mind
In between time, Chapter nine, they cheer to my rhymes
Stay after mines, it ain't fair, let the paint smear
Glossy paper sticking bombing out and saying "clear"
See my face clear on Shirley Ave in a dirty cat
Out on Houston Street, with a dirty rap
I keep my strong arm steady and if it's the end of the world
I'm Jon Connor standing by the levy, it gets heavy
One little, two little, three little goons
Four little, five little, six bullet wounds
I don't take shorts, only showers and shits
I sit with a court, making hours and hits
It's a race against time, show up power to pimp
We run this shit, that's all, that's it
