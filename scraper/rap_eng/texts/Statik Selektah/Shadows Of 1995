"One love to Doo Wop and the Bounce Squad. '95 do your thing" - Guru

[Verse One]:
First things first
Before I do what I do
I gotta say fuck B.E.T. for shittin' on Guru
And nah it ain't the topic, but it's only right
Cause he's from the same town as the creators of this project
Butcha hit me up and said, "It's logic
Look kid, Statik instrumentals. Rappers on top of it."
Not involving the dude that inspired this
Is like making a tune about consciousness and not including Talib
I was like, "Mos Def. It's Common Sense cause most kids
Ain't got a sense of what of '95 Live meant
If I was a producer, I'd be Buckwild, Clark Kent
Not enough credit but regardless I'm content
Cause some get it
Cats cherish it, still to this day recite the lyrics back effortless
The realest relate
First tape to be compared to an earthquake
Broke ground
If I was around in the 50's
I'd probably sign to Motown

[Scratch Chorus]:

[Verse Two]:
Listen
Braves beat the Indians
9ers beat the Chargers
Rockets beat the Magic
OJ beat the charges
New Jersey Drive
Braveheart watchin'
Oklahoma bombin'
Million Man Marching
Blacks and Hispanics had love for our president
Selina got murdered by her fan club president
Cocaine got Darryl Straws suspended
Jordan came out of retirement
Tyson out the penitent
Howard Stern, Sony Playstation, Yahoo
All made their debut
And Los Angeles Rams
Made a move out to St. Lou
And Pamela An'
Married dude from the Motley Crew
No Swine Flu, just the Ebola
No T-Mobile, just Motorola
Jack phones, Biggie and Hov
Brought it back home
On the radio without payola that's a fact homes
