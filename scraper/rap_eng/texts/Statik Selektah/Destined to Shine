[Intro]
Waiting for my moment
Waiting for my moment, I was destined to shine
Waiting for my moment I was destined to shine
Shine

[Verse 1]
Feeling the pain I went through just make me want it
I would've had a studio but I just can't afford it
Days rapping on the answering machine tape recorder
Searching for change for the jukebox saving quarters
I fell in love with the game at a young age
Thinking that I might be as good as Jay one day
I'm looking past all the attempts to ruin my perception
I would ask 'em what I did, but who am I to question
I'm still standing in the booth, I knew that I was destined
Shout out to Destined though, this my destiny
Measure the spoon for greatness, gotta put me in the recipe
You best believe my efforts be effortless but the best of me
Is what you're gettin' every single time that you get to me
Usually settled, but heard a miracle's near and see
I'm working music medical, words are lyrical therapy
So here it be, I never mute it, my music is therapeutic
I do this for the teachers and the tutors
The parents and the students
From geekiest to the coolest
To the girls that be the rudest
This is all y'all music
Sick flow, cough cough cough, hall flu shit
Now you need a hall pass
I'm as off the wall as NFL Street when you throw an off the wall pass
And it look like I'm playing in large pads
Jet 2 blast off, now I need a launch pad
Waiting on the moments that my flow will probably launch
And I can prove the judges and perception killers wrong
And even out the odds and get my back up off the wall, damn
And you can tell that I go through a lot
But I just hear 'em tell me, "Jet 2, I told you to stop."
But quitting's hard when you're halfway on the road to the top
And they just hope you would drop
Bumpin' India. Arie feelin' cool like
How can I live one day without music
Really can't sing, but I'mma try until I learn it though
I'mma make sure in every way that you heard my soul
'Cause I can hide behind the smiles, but I'm hurtin' though
I'm hot-headed, winter coat, spittin' furnace flow
Tryin' to stack a bunch of cake, but I ain't tryin' to burn the dough
I ain't tryin' to burn it though
'Cause I ain't learned to cook, but ain't nobody perfect though
I guess the audience is first to know
I never open up to anything until the verse is closed
Meaning that you'll never see me open up in person
Unless I close my guard down and spoke a couple verses
But the verses that I speak are never spoken up in person
I'm kind of dealing with a holy war, a couple curses
But I'm destined to be victorious when I emerge 'em
I never quit, I guess I'm just a heaven of a person
I slip a few, but get an extra seven from the first one
But they don't understand me though
They just wanna see him break, they just get mad he don't
Sad the only thing that they remember from this man is quotes
That's all he got, so stopping, just understand he won't
To make a long story short, I'm just
(Waiting for my moment, I was destined to shine)
I'm just
I'm just (waiting for my moment, I was destined to shine)
