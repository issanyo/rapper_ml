[Verse One] [Joe Scudda]:
You a rookie
I'm a veteran
Can figure anybody I ain't better than
If raps was sports I'd be an All American
You know, four year letter man
I rap circles around you
Dudes on one leg, call me rap's pelican
If you ain't know, every summer I jam fam
And I ain't never seen the meadowlands
So go catch up, rewind that
When I'm that, you'll need a map to find that
I'd like to wish you luck (why?)
Cause I was there an hour ago and you thirty minutes behind that
I'm so ahead of my time
Did it ten years ago before I said it in rhymes
You can bet it'll be fine, go and bend your mind
This shit so dope I'm gettin' federal time
Uh

[Scratch Chorus]:
"Man, I'm high off life, fuck it I'm wasted
It ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it
It ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded" - Jay-Z 'Allure'

[Verse Two] [Truth North]:
Uh, slow down pump your breaks
This shit's here somethin' you might not want to face
A pill so bitter you might not want a taste
Quick draw if you want, some of y'all should trace
It don't really matter you still could get erased
Tryin' to step by the money make a jam type case
I'mma go getter
Crushed, let y'all chase
15 minutes early still 20 minutes late
Pssst, great
Me and Scudda hit 'em with the bass
Make a nigga suck blow like a birthday cake
You might not finish the race but I'm first place
Eat dust like a motherfuckin' intake
Whatever you make fam I'm gon' take
Till you can't take it no more and you call for a break
Pop ya
Tape you up after I box ya
Put a ribbon on, send ya ass off real proper like

[Scratch Chorus]:
"Man, I'm high off life, fuck it I'm wasted
It ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it
It ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded"

[Verse Three] [Diz Gibron]:
Gibron, they say I'm good money homie, get a look at me
Higher learning style, go and book bag me
Good happy, I'm livin' the way I hope for
Word of mouth doin' more than a promotion tour
Goin' raw, no head but I'm fully blown
Stay hidden my nigga, I get my hoodie on
Took me a long time
All fine, when I get to the finish line, bet it's all mine
All time great, said and done that
Leak joints free, make a million off a comeback
I come from the dope game, I know fame
Now I make my own lane, know the name, propane
Slow gain, long term earner
Big buzz, tall money but he short height, long burner
Equation is all murder, assume that
When I move forward, niggas know they gotta move back

"Man, I'm high off life, fuck it I'm jaded"
