[Verse 1]
Yo, listen
I'm top tier, your torn up top when the top tear
Tat his eye from the animal akh, I box bears
Got those quotes to Glock pop folks
Two times in the head and laugh
That's the knock knock joke
Shots fly, I nail ya
One eye open scoping, the Popeye the sailor, listen
Used to get hungry off of distress plate
Used to get money off of cassette tape
The best eight made great, the Godfather large armor
Logical, I'm on point chronological
I don't rock boots with spikes nigga
Don't watch Roots with white niggas
Bullets [?] when the eight's spittin'
Blow the shit out of proportion, erasin' racism
A degree from my declaration
But saying Sean P say the P with the exclamation
Motherfucker
