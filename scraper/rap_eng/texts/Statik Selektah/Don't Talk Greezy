[Hook: Statik Selektah (x2)]

Should thank the lord that you blew up, softy
And don't talk greezy, you grew up off me
Don't don't talk greezy, you grew up off me
Don't don't talk greezy, you grew up off me

[Verse 1: Slaine]
Through the years I've been grown, I've been known as a molotov grown
Firestarter with the power of a holocaust poem
A pencil full of history and bought off loan
On this path that I roam, pull him halfway home
My tone is laced with wisdom, my dome against the system
I've shown, I have risen, my rhythm couldn't be blown
I'm hard as stone, hottest known to be part of the throne
Kingdom, father, beyond, money, powder and porn
I was born in the chaos, amongst the stupid things
Never took a day off, the one's a future king
People full of jealousy, envy, pursuit for rings and gold
That's how the angels wings are sold, and clipped off
Span off nips, pussy lips licked and clips licked off
Secrets untold man, you both pushed up, your bitch tipped off
People are just off, that's why I'm paranoid and pissed off

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Slaine]
I plan to get back to the place where I'm from
No matter how much I give, they still hate the outcome
Like I'm walking around the block with some dirty sneakers on
And a beat up Taurus, plates hanging with the speakers blown
You would think I'm a nobody, the way they look away
It's like they had a opportunity that I took away, instead
It's the other way around, I am laying ground for them
I'm just trying to do the best I can, ahem
Look I spit fire, so no-one else can torch me
Still the same cat that i was back on the porch, see
Now things have changed a little bit up in my story
Them crabs down the corner, they don't wanna see my glory
Plus I feel the Devil's fire burning, trying to scorch me
Wifey was my best friend, but she divorced me
I don't wanna do this to you now, but you forced me
Spit at the Devil and Jesus Christ can't cross me

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Slaine]
My competition's killers, so guarded, cold-hearted guerrillas
No honest bogart in my spot, mind's not for stealers and thieves
I feel thats the least that I can do to protect it, I stand for what I stand for
And that shit is hectic, I ran across the planet with this
I was real, they was fake, that's why the amateurs missed
Thats why I feel you when the producers and your managers pissed
Thats why y'all philly and your bandanas don't fit, shit
Look at you dissing me in a club that's half-full
On a show you're opening up for, for a cat that you don't know
I've been around the world, to places you won't go
Whilst your story and your songs don't belong, they don't flow
You misguided little boys, you don't believe me true
Fuck my neighbourhood and my girl, she can leave me too
I'll always be this dude, I'm done paying my dues
You talking about the shooter whilst I'm spraying my jewels, oooo
