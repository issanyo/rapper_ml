Statik Selektah

Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness
Standing in the spotlight without no doubt
We gonna do a song that you never heard before
I wanna get into it man you know, moving doing it you know
Can I count it off? 1 2 3

Verse 1

In my heart, where I go there's a place where one knows there's an ancient soul oh oh
It's in the air, like a ghost and there's spirits everywhere said it's freezing cold oh oh oh

Chorus

All I try is to strike a chord
Tell me what's a genre even for?
If everyone is looking for the same thing oh
All we need is rhythm on our brain yeah yeah

Verse 2

The new rock roll, the blue eyed soul, been doing this since 5 like the new iphone
You take some Stevie and Nas and mix it up in a pot and what the hell do you get? You got a hell of a flow
My innervision sees everything that it knows, think for yourself because I got a Rubbersoul
It's not A Man's World but the funk's in control

Verse 1

Chorus

All I try is to strike a chord
Tell me what's a genre even for?
Not everything I'm hearing sounds the same oh oh
Cause I can make it different with my slang oh oh

La la la
La la la la oh oh
La la la oh oh
La la la la la oh oh

(That was kind of dope, let me double that)
