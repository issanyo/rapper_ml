[Intro]
So fresh
Ah man this is my joint (same as I ever been)
When I put this joint on, every time I wake up (same as I ever been)
Whatever I went through the day before or the night before (same as I ever been)
Just like wash away, you know?
It's a new day man

[Verse 1]
This the greatest city in the world
Ain't nothing easy, people is greasy as Jerry curls
Man your favorite rapper not a leader, got coke but it's not a litre
We eats the scraps like bottom feeders
Like crabs in a barrel
The road apparel get you into a battle
"Pow" then bullet go through your head like the rockstar fame
My life is like a rockstar game
The block got flames
You jump out of the pot into the fire
When we speakin' on a higher plane
Deeper than leviathan
And it's sweeter than a violin
The music sweep you off your feet
While the system tries to keep you in the street
Even cops walk the beat, crooks face the music
Sound like the block is the perfect place to do it
Be up all night until the break of dawn
It's like I'm born again when I hear my favorite song

[Hook] x2
So fresh
Same I ever been
So fresh
When I hear my favorite song

[Verse 2]
Some folks give 'em less than good
Whole life right there they never left the hood
This city got nothin' for 'em
Out of sight, out of mind so they just ignore 'em
They sit back and they twist it backwards
Nothing guaranteed except death and taxes
That's why they get so high
Stand in one spot watch life go by
The hands on the clock go slower than the van on the block
Every plan is a scam or a plot
Every man got his hand in the pot but nobody got a pot to piss in
The preacher preaching, they don't stop and listen
Hard living, cars driven at a high speed pace in a high speed chase
You can read between the lines in my face
I was up all night long listenin' to my favorite song

[Hook]
