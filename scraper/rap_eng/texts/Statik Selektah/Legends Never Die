[Prelude: Easy Money]
Ever since the day I got on
They told me I would never make it this long
Now years after the day that I'm gone
They'll be playing my songs
And my name will live on
When everybody thought that I was insane
I stood tall after all of the pain
So let the good Lord call on my name
Cause I done let my mark on the game

[Hook: Easy MoneyST (Xzibit)]
We never die (yeahh, never die!)
We just live on (live on, live on)
We never die (yeahh, never die!)
We just live on

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
Yeah I'm a cowboy steppin clear
With a pistol pointblank behind your right ear
Yeah because fear is not a option
Say my name three times, I appear with a shotgun
Now what you motherfuckers want from me?
I'm from the gutter, I'm medicated by drug money
Take everything, there ain't nothing else
You can take from me
Never break from you niggers
Swinging until my hands bloody
Time flies dreams die people lose faith
Tryna hide behind a lie with a straight face
Buzz kill, boots on the ground cause I'm straight lace
Fuck love, never needed love in the first place

[Hook: Easy MoneyST (Xzibit)]
We never die (yeahh, never die!)
We just live on (live on, live on)
We never die (yeahh, never die!)
We just live on

[Verse 2: B-Real]
So many doubted so little time
So many haters coming to mind
Later for waste cause moments to bind
Because I would never look back
And regretted this fuckin life
Around I do it for the ones who supported the dream
And making every second of their life as a part of my team
It take the heart of a lion
The crown of a king
Bring up a throne and you keep the frame in mind
But you still singing my songs
Still serial kill the bullshit, spit up the thrills
And if you will, you're not the killer
For real I be dealin
The run of the mill, with no skill, top Billy the dun
That's why I reply legends never die

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
Yeah I was born to live forever
I am legend gather my thoughts
And line'em up together
Feel like pullin' my own Beretta put it to my head
Better days ahead
Left for dead with my daily bread
Yeah I'll cause a slaughter in your tabernacle
I stole your castle and guillotined your queen
Los Angeles to the rotten apple
I'm playing tackle
Get it, the crush's cold like
Going to war with the Russians
Starving like my ribs and my stomach is touching
I'm filthy as a pig
Always drinkin' and fuckin
It's just my destiny till the death of me
To be stand and deliver
Confessions of an unapologetic serial killer

[Hook]
