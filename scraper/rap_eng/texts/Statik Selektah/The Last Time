[Intro]
You're telling yourself, for such a long time
Now you're ready, for the change
You're telling yourself, for such a long time
Yes you're ready, to make a change (it's time)

[Hook]
I drove home drunk, but it's the last time
I drove home drunk, last time (it's time)
I drove home drunk, but it's the last time
I drove home drunk

[Verse 1]
I drove home drunk, but it's the last time
Swear I almost died, I mean flatline
Swerving in n' out of lines
Jesus grabbed the wheel cuz I was almost blind
I just want to make it home now
I'm a king, time to sit up in my throne now
Not a cell or a hole now
I got a family I'm a hold down (down)
So it's different this go round
Quit risking my life to make my folks proud
Remember when everybody was so down
Run around the city with rounds in case it go down (down)
Well we getting too old now
Gotta give these kids jewels, so they can grow now
All the liquor and smoke we gotta tone down
Before we get tore down, watch how it go down (it's time)

[Hook]
I drove home drunk, but it's the last time
I drove home drunk, last time (it's time)
I drove home drunk, but it's the last time
I drove home drunk

[Verse 2]
Drunk by myself bottle under the seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
In the mirror, I see cop lights they getting clearer
With visions of police, sending me up the river
It's bitter sweet, all them records that I did
I can't get back that time with my kid
When she was young I would lay her in the crib
But now I ain't never ever in the crib
I'm too gone, when I'm here and when I'm not here
I'm out of town, alone my mind's not clear
How can I fix it? When all I wanna do is grab a biscuit
And let six spit, I won't miss shit
Doc telling me chill, it's for ya own good
Drugs, liquor, fucking raw, no good
But I'm sick of facing the judge
I'm sick of faking this love
I'm sick of taking these drugs

[Hook]
I drove home drunk, but it's the last time
I drove home drunk, last time (it's time)
I drove home drunk, but it's the last time
I drove home drunk
