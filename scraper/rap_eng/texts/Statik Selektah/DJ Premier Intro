What up class?
Ready to take that test?
I know you ain't ready, but you better get ready
Royce Da 5'9", the artist
DJ Premier, your host, what up?
On the mix, Statik Selektah
And this is The Bar Exam
Now let me explain the shit you
When you pass the bar, you know on society and shit
That means you are one step closer to being licensed to practice law, alright?
Now, in this case, we gon' flip it on the hip-hop side of things
In our world, the bar exam means this:
We set the laws and we are licensed to give you an exam on how to motherfucking maintain skills
My nigga Royce is about to show y'all how to do that, you know?
Word up, I repeat, this is the bar exam
Album coming soon
Street Hop
Executively produced by yours truly
We ain't gon' repeat it, just remember
And oh yeah
Lot of y'all rap niggas is really talking tough these days
But when it comes to your skills level
It's on some Mickey Mouse shit for real
Step your shit up motherfuckers
That Mickey Mouse shit got to go
You know it
Therefore, you will never pass the bar exam
