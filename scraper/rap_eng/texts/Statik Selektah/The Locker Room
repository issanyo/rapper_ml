[Verse 1: Dave East]
Coming from the bottom floor
Now we in the Prada Store
Couple bands on me homie
Soul probably got some more
Real niggas love me unconditional, ain't gotta talk
Even got the driver blowing sour, we ain't gotta walk
Started as a lookout, then I got my own work
Accountable as paper after school, that was my homework
Text wasn't going through, I don't think this phone work
Now I got my own shirt, I really did my own dirt
Same niggas hating, same niggas want a picture now
Freaky always on my mind, it's hard to put the liquor down
Loose spots for raw, 2Pac Shakur, I get around
Snapbacks, no more fitted now, I brought some hitters round
To silence the whispers and the side talk
Really from the streets, my first cousin is the sidewalk
I stopped hearing gossip the minute the pilots fly off
Stay in your lane, you missed your exit, you shoulda got off
I just want a Audemars, cuban and a foreign car
Say I've got them black bottles, they thinking we own the bar
I was out grindin, you was playstation, Tony Hawk
No cab fare, could only walk through this lonely dark Harlem
This for Carver, Jeff Wilson, AK's
11, 99, Johnson Taft, they make cake
Blowing exotic in the tropics in a linnen shirt
Harlem till I'm in the dirt, leave these niggas feelings hurt

[Hook: Dave East]
It's hard to leave the crib without the hammer, they'll rock ya
Got kicked out of school, he had the hammer in his locker
I'm from the streets, never won a Grammy or an Oscar
Keep a good lawyer just in case they try'na knock ya
It's hard to leave the crib without the hammer, they'll rock ya
Got kicked out of school, he had the hammer in his locker
I'm from the streets, never won a Grammy or an Oscar
Keep a good lawyer just in case they try'na knock ya

[Verse 2: Dave East]
They say I'm cool, like a move, like a groove, like a gangster
We blow pounds my niggas hold me down like an anchor
Downtown shopping, me and gudda on some high fashion
[?] still ride past us, they swing but they not Cassius
Green we got faster the dream from not having
I see success but this VVS will stop traffic
Shaking box from palace, I just got a call from Statik
It's Lucky 7, my bitch undressed and chiroq splashing
But I'm a Henny sipper, talk fly skinny nigga
Crumb to a loaf, you can see we're stacking pennies, getcha
I seen thug on my plug, got the block bumping
We ain't got shit to talk about, unless you cop something
Collecting change like a meter
Derek Jeter, dump the baggies food save it in the freezer
That Benz like a woman, that Mercedes I just need her
First frag and probably get a reaction from Peter

It's hard to leave the crib without the hammer, they'll rock ya

I'm from the streets, never won a Grammy or an Oscar
Keep a good lawyer just in case they try'na knock ya
It's hard to leave the crib without the hammer, they'll rock ya
Got kicked out of school, he had the hammer in his locker
I'm from the streets, never won a Grammy or an Oscar
Keep a good lawyer just in case they try'na knock ya
