[Intro: DJ Premier]
Yo Royce, the gloves is on?
Don't play around with these motherfuckers
It's time to

[Refrain: Royce Da 5'9" & Statik Selektah & DJ Premier]
(It's the Bar Exam!)
Hit 'em
Hit 'em
Hit 'em
Go!

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Five-nine stand back, he about to blow
Snatch your ho, let her go she about to blow
That .44 that he's holdin' is about to blow
I thought I told you motherfuckers it's over, brrrrrp
Stick up, I got the gats out grindin'
Give me any kinda Preme track I rap out rhymin'
And brrrrp! Switch up, turnaround and rap bout diamonds
Tell the underground I'm shinin', I'll be back I promise
What you lookin' at dog? Your boy is fire
The more time goes by, his nose gets higher
Plus he been pushin' that raw, he knows what he wants
To fuck a Pussycat Doll before he retires
It's all about black and white, it's like a piano
The white and black cards you dealt, life is a gamble
You might rap hard today, like you an animal
Then suddenly, tomorrow, you gay, like The Sopranos
I done seen it all, lyrical niggas who dumb it
Down, for y'all niggas to sing along and still do nothin'
You simple like the ABC's, is y'all countin'?
You like a caption at the bottom, with the ball bouncin'

[Chorus: Royce da 5'9"]
Five-nine, stand back, he about to blow
Snatch your ho, let her go, she about to blow
That fo' fo' that he holdin' is about to blow
Preme, tell 'em who it is just so that they know

[Refrain: Royce Da 5'9" & DJ Premier]
(Royce, five-nine) Hit 'em
(Just a young nigga caught in the mix) Hit 'em
(It's rugged and underground) Hit 'em
(You can't run no game) Go!

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Five-nine, crystal clear, pistol in here
You disappear and soon as I shoot it if you appear
You see it clear if I appear to be clutchin' a shottie
The butt on the gun is bigger than Buffy The Bodys
I go upside your head with it and fuck up the party
Oooh, I make your ass loose those couple Bacardis
The 40 long came along with a couple of bodies
I know a couple Corrleones, a couple of Gottis
My story long nigga, I stay deep in the drama
I get my Maury on nigga and sleep with ya momma
I done did wifes, did dimes, did niggas in when they tripped
Cause they found out the kids mines
Blew the tec off, drew the column up on who the best
Put himself, Nas, Jay on it and moved the rest off
I'm a gangsta as well as a star, put 'em together
And you catch me pickin' up where Guru left off

[Chorus: Royce da 5'9"]
Five-nine, stand back, he about to blow
Snatch your ho, let her go, she about to blow
That fo' fo' that he holdin' is about to blow
Preme, tell 'em who it is just so that they know

[Refrain: Royce Da 5'9" & DJ Premier]
(Royce, five-nine) Hit 'em
(Just a young nigga caught in the mix) Hit 'em
(It's rugged and underground) Hit 'em
(You can't run no game) Go!

[Outro: Royce da 5'9"]
I know I said
"I wanna fuck a Pussycat Doll before I retire"
What I mean was
I wanna fuck one
Before the song goes off
