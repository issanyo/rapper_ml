[Intro]
Ah man, Statik. I don’t think these motherfuckers realize what’s about to go down right now. It’s classic shit. I’m the barbarian and I specialize in torture, pain and suffering, agony. I was an outcast but we winning, we ain’t never losing

[Verse 1]
If the god said it, it's barbaric, fuck if Minaj said it
She never has to admit it and give my bars credit
I’m going out on a limb and sayin' they prosthetic
I eat these rappers alive and call it a small fetish
Never sympathetic even when they spit pathetic
I’m prophetic, I make 'em wish that they never said it
(Huh, make 'em wish they never said it) make 'em regret it
I shake up your spirit when creatin' these lyrics
From out the shackles and tabernacles I stab and tackle
Any crab or jackal that’s laughin' at you, I smack and grab 'em
Like I’m John Cena, there ain’t a Don cleaner
Heavy shoes to fill, I’m breakin' the concrete up
The biggest nigga in the yard again
And the streets we starving in
I leave a couple up in your cardigan
I’m born again, sippin' Patrone and gin
You’d never stand a chance in the ring that I’m sparring in

[Hook]
Allow me to reintroduce myself
I got them scars in my tissue, all my bars is official
Allow me to reintroduce myself
I spit the pain and glory, let me explain my story, yeah
Allow me to reintroduce myself
I’m still from the same discipline where niggas [?]
Allow me to reintroduce myself, my niggas
Homie, I fuckin' live it

[Verse 2]
I am mythological, prodigal son of a diabolical
Volatile and methodical, biological obstacle
Pathological chronicles of this fuckin phenomenal
Astronomical, powerful, why was they ever doubtin' you?
Nigga if I was you I would bow to the god
Up in prison, my vision I would scour the yard
Lookin' for prey, what can I say?
I got these fiends all droolin' when I’m cookin' this yay
There’s not a nigga that’s better than I’m a veteran
Severin heads, my brotherin threads is leather and dreads
I’mma peasent with led, but a king with a gun
Slingin' for fun, ain’t no room in my kingdom to come
Barbarian bars, leavin' caesarean scars
All these wack ass albums they comparing to ours
Statik and Ran, im just a savage with grams
We hit the block hard soon as we establish a plan

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
King Leonidas, I’m bias whenever I would ride it
Recite it and cause a riot, I’m tired of all these liars
I’m often startin' fires and makin' these frauds retire
Hopin they all expire, I’m what these broads admire
An outcast, rebel without a cause nigga
I ain’t a faggot so I ain’t gotta say pause nigga
It’s truly yours nigga, one of the greatest
We in the class by ourselves, give a fuck if you played us
Winning gold like the Lakers, I’m exposin' these haters
To the wrath of a giant, blastin' the iron
No niggas faster than I am, holding a razor
Cold as a glaciar, niggas tragically dyin'
Give you status for trying, I’m as bad as the mayans
Predict the future, medusa, it’s the clash of the titans
Statik and Ran, automatics and grands
We hit the block hard soon as we establish a plan

[Hook]
