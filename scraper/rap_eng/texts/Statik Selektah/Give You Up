[Hook: Papa-Bear]

Well I ain't neva gonna give you up
No, I ain't neva gonna give you up
Well I ain't neva gonna give you up
No, I ain't neva gonna give you up
I ain't neva gonna give you up
I ain't neva gonna give you up
Well I ain't neva gonna give you up
No, I ain't neva gonna give you up

[Verse 1: Papa-Bear]

I could never give you up, you're my baby
Lately, I've realized I need you greatly
Without you, life is fucking crazy
Everybody thinks I'm lazy
Stop being so naive and get a real job please
Why don't you see who's hiring?
Cause I just don't give a fuck about that
I love rap, so all y'all can kiss my white ass
I'm taking my own path
Don't be mad, be glad
And always remember
Nothing lasts, nothing lasts forever
Please baby, please remember

[Hook: Papa-Bear]

Well I ain't neva gonna give you up
No, I ain't neva gonna give you up
Well I ain't neva gonna give you up
No, I ain't neva gonna give you up
I ain't neva gonna give you up
I ain't neva gonna give you up
Well I ain't neva gonna give you up
No, I ain't neva gonna give you up
