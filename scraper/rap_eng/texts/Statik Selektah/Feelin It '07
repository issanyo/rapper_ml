[Intro: Royce Da 5'9" & Statik Selektah]
Yeah
Some real motherfucking bossy shit right here, my nigga
It's the Bar Exam
I'm so bossy
M.I.C., nigga
What up, Miko
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Mecca]
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the la
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Nigga, the Benz is tinted, I'm watching Menace in it
It's so fucking roomy, you can play tennis in it
Ten times out of ten times a ten is in it
Riding with me, if y'all start it up, then I'm finishing it
I stay focused, keep that paper in motion
I keep a long-legged ho on a stroll on 8th and Ocean
Me and her got secrets between us no one knows
It will start snowing in Miami if she blow her nose
I got the hoes, my nigga, they call me Sloppy Joe
Foursomes, fivesomes, y'all party, we rock n' roll
Nigga, your fate will hit you when you aware and you
In the presidential suite that looks like a tornado went through
Two bitches laying with ya, bitches on top of bitches
On the floor, looking like they're sleeping after playing Twister
I'm pissing on the condom floating on the toilet water
Thinking to myself, "damn, do I really want a daughter?"

[Chorus: Mecca]
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the la
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

[Interlude: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, my nigga
My nigga, Kino, you said you wanted bossy
So here you have it, bossy
Whoo Kid, you got to go "pow" to this one

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Louie slippers, Prada shoes, the new edition
For my new mistress, the Gucci with the groovy zippers
The Lord is truly with us
I got the Caviar shits, the Fila farts, I got the Louie hiccups
I'm a sprayaholic, what ever way to call it
Pistol of the singles, strippers treat me like I'm made of wallet
But I don't be trickin with them, you can find me sittin with them
Sippin with them, shortly after that, you see me dippin with them
(I'm feeling it) Be the answer
I be on the road looking just like Usher, it just be me and dancers
Til the wheels are rolling, nigga we riding
You ain't gon' see them hoes on stage but they still performing
How you feel in the morning, before these hoes brush their teeth
They like to suck dick without giving a warning
They just met but they don't mind each other
Both of these hoes' breath gotta smell like pussy and condom rubbers (Don't kiss em!)

[Chorus: Mecca]
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the la
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the la
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

[Outro: Royce Da 5'9" & Mecca]
Pure game
M.I.C. Records
Yeah
This motherfucking mixtape
Finding the humor, the humor inside of violence
So it's like, it's really about versatility
I chose this motherfucking beat cause I just ain't feeling a lot of y'all niggas' beats and shit
It's a new era for me, a lot of this shit is new for me
You know what I'm saying, but this is the reason why I feel like I'm the best rapper in the world
Cause I can do what every other nigga can do
Can't none of y'all motherfuckers do what I can do
That's my word, that's pure game
I can go from MCing
To laying back and kicking game
I can write stories
Y'all motherfuckers catch up, man
'06
Yeah
Shout out to my nigga, Preem
L in the sky
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moet
