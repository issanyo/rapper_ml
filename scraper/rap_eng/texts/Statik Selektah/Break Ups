[Verse 1: Reks]
I came to build with you, paint a real picture
I dont gas you up, I keep it real with you
I dont walk around town with the six figures
Whisper in your ear what I'd buy you to get with you
I ain't never been the life of the party
Yet you always plant the seeds so you could call me
And I probably dont deserve you
Worthy of a world view
Travel cross oceans but he's still gon' hurt you
Im'a be your shoulder soldier ride or die
I'm the kind of guy counting my blessings cause I'm destined to catch ya eye
You gonna love me when you wake up and he ain't by your side
Say bye bye to the falsified realities
So many beautiful women become casualties
Let me be your healer, glady
You could have me to use and abuse
Push me grab me all you gotta do is ask me, and I'll be there

[Hook: C Sharp]
I don't wanna wait too long
For you to return back home
Feelings is much too strong
If you don't love me
Please let me know
So I can walk out that door
No break up to make ups no more
If you dont love me

[Verse 2: Reks]
My best regards to the love lost sentiments to women whove been cut off
Walked on, treated like a hit it quit it rap song
This ain't one of them rap songs
This a love poem to romance gone...wrong
When trust is long gone ill be ya ear
Listen here record careful you forever and more
He left you beefin with the landlord
And ya little man need a man for the answers
He just wanna fuck you
Give em lip he flex his muscles
Neighbors said they heard a tussle
Come here ma cause he ain't 'pose to touch you
He's supposed to love you treat you right
I can't knock his hustle
Wrote this song for the wrong thats been done to ladies in the humvee
Cause you livin comfee
Till he bored with you and throw you upon streets
Song speaks to the ones who seek one true love

[Hook: C Sharp]

[Verse 3: Reks]
Never wore the finer clothes drove expensive cars
I was into study halls tryna study broads
Women from venus, men are from mars
So I thought that we would meet up in the stars
Cheek she gave him, muah
I was gettin geeked thinkin she was gon show the bra
Till she told me we should pause
Get to know each other before we really get involved
But I was tryna get up in them draws
Introduced to blue balls dog
The truth was love her puppies was lovely
But now im tryna chat before you touch me
Rap you wanna fuck me no more with the break ups make ups
No time to waste love you dont love me
Please let me know so I can pack bags hit the road
Walk out that door fasho
Kid games for the kiddies im a grown man
Only plan to kick game if you with me

[Hook: C Sharp]
