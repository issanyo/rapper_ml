[Verse 1: Slaine]
I thought that I could never trust you
Never mind love you, lust you
Get a brush everytime I fuck you
Try to figure what a clever mind is up to
You trying to figure me out
Leave no evidence, just clues
Cuss you in the morning
Whisper at you when it's us two
Get drunk and high together
We fuck other sluts too
You crazy as I am and you think I'm a heroic guy
The way I live my life
How I handled what was going by
Fascinated to you but you get it, you don't judge me
I love you for that but I was hoping you don't love me
Me and you was beautiful
The world think that we're ugly
For years I've been trying
To clean the dirt that they drug me through
Still love my ex-wife she loves me too
But we can't coexist and that's the ugly truth
And I think she has a cold heart
She thinks I'm disgusting see
Fix the so and so garbage
This is how it all started
This is going to be hard to hold onto 'less you trusted me
See I love my son and I ain't fucking up my custody
I know what love is
And trust me baby it's a luxury
I grew up rough
I should be in a ditch so no one fucks with me
Thanks to bitches I got a few bucks in this tux with me
These eyes been around too long
I had enough to see
You've got a sad soul
I've got a torn heart
I'm a rebel and a villain baby
You're a porn star
Where do we go from here?
I don't think it's clear
Come close to me, talk to me while I drink this beer

[Hook: Slaine]
This our moment
So every single minute we spend
Trying to hold on to it
We may never get it again
This is our moment
This is our moment
And I don't want to stop but I can't save it
It's not killing me
So every single second we spend
Trying to hold on to it
'Cause I guess it lets me pretend
This is our moment
This is our moment
And I don't want to stop but I can't save it
It's not killing me

[Verse 2]
You left my chest breathless
Restless as the best sex is
But cracked my code and stole my phone
And checked the text message
Doing x and x is shooting out for mine
My ex gets it
We screaming throats until I'm closer to my next exit
You're intrusive, I'm abusive when it gets hectic
We break up, we make up and then we accept it
Are we a mess yes it's harder 'til we less hectic
We always crash and burn
And then we start up with our best effort
But when you came into my world I was so cold and lonely
I share my deepest darkest shit I never told the homies
Everything will be alright
As long as you keep holding on me
I'm with any business that you needed
When you called upon me
And you did everything and anything to make me feel
That I could pick myself back up
And if not you would take the wheel
Where do we go from here?
Don't think we'll ever know
Don't let me slip away
Don't want to let it go
