[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
One time, what's the word
What's the word, what's the word
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo yo
Turn me up on the headphones
Two times, twist the herb
Twist the herb, twist the herb
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
If looks could kill I let the swank drill like a deadly weapon
I drop bombs on an enemy at any second, uh
Look at me wrong I turn you to tombstone
Lock you in the crosshairs and you gone then I throw my deuce up
Sip sangritas with your señorita, like me gusta
See what that early morning cock will do up to your rooster
I bet my cockiness will boost her confidence
Then  you gon' wonder where your highness went

[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & BJ The Chicago Kid]
I bet she get low for a nigga like me
She get low for a nigga like me
Bet she get low for a nigga like me
Low for a nigga like me

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
So we burn the Mary Jane till the third degree
Some niggas biting flows yo, that's burglary
Same niggas acting like they never heard of me
A fuck nigga could get clocked, yo that's word to me

[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & BJ The Chicago Kid]
He get blown for a nigga like me
Get his head exposed for a nigga like me
Put him on the floor for a nigga like me

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Yo, my mind boggles when time toggles
In the ocean of stars it's hard to find goggles, we twisted up
So we put it in the air, don't let the J's start unravelling
We getting blown like a javelin
She throw it back like she time traveling
Rocked the boat so well, she jumped out and started paddling
I'm screaming "Land, ho!" 'bout to hit for sure
I motorboat it slow then I ripped the flow
I'm pretty sure, like nice beaches that
Even at my weakest I still leave 'em speechless
How you like those peaches? Find me rotting the apple
'Bout to bump so plump, 'bout to lock in the grapple
Feeling like the highest man about to tackle
Facts like the tat under the cap of the Snapple
Cats get decapitated for acting a fool
Blacks get their ass sprayed just for making a move

[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & BJ The Chicago Kid]
We get high and say "Fuck the police"
That’s why we get high and say "Fuck the police"
That’s why we get high and say "Fuck the police"
Yo

[Verse 4: Joey Bada$$]
Cause every time I make a move they be sweating me
They want another black man in penitentiary
It's even hard for that man standing next to me
Cause he could catch a bullet that was really meant for me
It's like every step bring me close to destiny
And every breath I get closer to the death of me
I'm just tryna carry out my own legacy
But the place I call home ain't letting me

[Hook: Joey Bada$$]
Cause you can't get by if you don't respect an OG
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG

[Verse 5: Joey Bada$$]
Cause every corner I turn a nigga testing me
And every morning I mourn just for the less of me
Sometimes I ask the Lord why he be blessing me
And not my brothers whose souls now rest in peace

[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & BJ The Chicago Kid]
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
Hope for a nigga like me
Just pray there's hope for a nigga like me

[Verse 6: Joey Bada$$]
I'm something like the chairman of the board, ranting
I feel invincible like McMannon
One of the last original emcees that's left standing on the planet
Strike like a meteor, do remedial damage, damn it
Cats can't stand it, get they ass handed and branded
By the lyrical New York City bandit
True Warrior like Rembrandt
Yo some cats claim they fly but really been landed
I really can't stand it, let me take a seat
This where Rosa Parks her bum now make some room for me
PE in your beeper, hun you can read it and weep
My old hoes call me now, leave a message after the beep
I don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak
I don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak
I just wanna be, girl, I just wanna be
I just wanna be free

[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & BJ The Chicago Kid]
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
Hope for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me, for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me, for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me, for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me, for a nigga like me
Compton to Bed-Stuy
Hope for a nigga like me
Hope for a nigga like me
Hope for a nigga like me
