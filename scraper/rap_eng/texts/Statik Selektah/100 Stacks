[Intro: JFK]
Yea
A 1-2 a 1-2
Here we go
Check it out

[Verse 1: JFK]
It was a crime to rhyme, so funny to some rappers
Spittin, tryna collect that bill, money and sums
Revolving a gun, them problems come
Call the party, someone's son
Damn you guys were both so young
Where I'm from you catch the whole case
Autopsy photos in your cell, seen his whole face
No you ain't got no day all because life's probay
Under one now, tryna catch that cold case
Shit got real, now you feelin goofy
In the club hanging with Puki, listen Dooky
Life is spooky, that molly turn to cooky
Think you're Bruce Lee, find yourself and lose teeth, what's beef
Here today, gone today where I play
Yea that song play Amazing Grace, yea that's what I call a long day
Hey we go this, I pursue it
Get down with ODB, become an opportunist, word to the truest

[Verse 2: Krondon of Strong Arm Steady]
Yea, first you owe me now you don't know me
Yea, fallacy, yea the fake and phony
For a 6 kill a Joe, a nigga joke on it
Word to DZA, yea my Harlem crowning
Yes, the daddy mac macaroni
On the Macintosh, medium lady matrimony
Funked on me, watch the world, I hose on it
And reflect on life lessons my granny told me
Totally toughed out, supposed to be on it
In the precinct yelling, telling the whole story
Yea, raiders of the lost ark found glory
In the open territory to teleport me
Hah, taking notes to the testimony
Seein' Tony tote Tony Black California
Homie seen me, deed me and I see it counts
Have been withdrawn, nigga don't leave me out
