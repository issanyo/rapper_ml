[Verse 1]
Yeah,wrestle with addiction
Triple H in his prime clinically imbalanced just the way I'm designed
2015 I've popped xans and wasted my time
Hit the strip club wasted faded outta my mind
I've fall asleep with the lights on at 05:00 in the morning
And the TV blaring xan is the only thing I was hearing and it's so apparent because it's wearing on my older parents
