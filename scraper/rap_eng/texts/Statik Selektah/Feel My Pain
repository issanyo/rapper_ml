[Intro]
Let's get it poppin', salute me
I'm comin' through, everybody's a target
Feel me...

[Verse 1]
This ain't just rap, it's about connects
Y'all crabs could trap talk, this is about respect
I'm a mixture of Mutulu and Malcolm X
Young Rick the Ruler, my mouth's a mess
My lil' homie home he on house arrest
Try to tell homie be grown, this is about success
The streets been sewn, we seen a thousand deaths
So many nuts bust I barely get aroused from sex
Try to do Lears at the clear, lounge on decks
Amongst those who couldn't care what's around my neck
Tinted specs BBM'n or sendin' a text, linen fresh
Either we sinnin' or blendin' in with Execs
Nigga I'm blessed, puff blunts with B.I.G. in the flesh
Due to Nas in '95 with the bridge address
Live what I rep, I'm real no identity theft, my will
It's like a prisoner appealin' the stretch, it's ill
Recreation, my reputation
Could bring together the gangs from separation
So, no dough, no explanations, blow!
Get lows, my expectations glow, OG, G-O-D
And I don't know near nigga that could Deebo me

[Chorus: scratches by Statik Selektah]
"The way I put them words together"
"They want something new
So let's get reacquainted"
"Time to re-up gotta recycle the flow"
"You talking like this was a thing of the past"
"Switch hustles been killing 'em ever since
Hey you tell the truth dawg, it only makes sense"

[Verse 2]
Reminisce, venomous, this is limitless
Started from The Genesis
Schooled on what business is
Touch down scrimmages, targetin' your Nemesis
Barkin' at your innocence, findin' that you're friends ain't shit
Let me finish it, few niggas benefit
New niggas tend to send a cent to the penetent
Cam style, I know now what killer meant
No resemblance, movin' off my inner strength
Superb penmanship, heard that my pen was sick
Never impotent, wonder where my niggas went
Die hard is still the point even when I'm bent
Fly cars, Louie scarfs, everything is meant
Two-ten new in charge I'ma bring suspense
White Ice Blue shupar y'all ain't seen me since
The young God, took a charge for 'em two attempts
In my defense, I'm due to vent

[Chorus: scratches by Statik Selektah]
"The way I put them words together"
"They want something new
So let's get reacquainted"
"Time to re-up gotta recycle the flow"
"You talking like this was a thing of the past"
"Switch hustles been killing 'em ever since
Hey you tell the truth dawg, it only makes sense"

[Verse 3]
Rap convo, blackin' over congos
Glass condo, relaxed in the dawn mode
Both arms fold, feet up on the console
Fuckin' bomb holds skeetin' on your cornrows
My boy Alonzo beat another homo
Let the Dom flow, try and get LeBron's dough
Head honcho high with a Milan glow
How them horns blow make a nigga mambo
White Bronco, address beef pronto
Breast meat combo, don't be a John Doe
Still calm though, OG at the trial when they hit Busy Bee in '03
Low key, live wire, flow be
5th gear mode, it could rip earlobes
Sip Ros', think quick on my tiptoes
Life's a Bitch and the chick chose

[Chorus: scratches by Statik Selektah]
"The way I put them words together"
"They want something new
So let's get reacquainted"
"Time to re-up gotta recycle the flow"
"You talking like this was a thing of the past"
"Switch hustles been killing 'em ever since
Hey you tell the truth dawg, it only makes sense"
