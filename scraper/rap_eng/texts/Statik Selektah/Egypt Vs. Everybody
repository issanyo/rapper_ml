(Intro)

Egypt Vs. Everybody

(Verse 1: NA BILL)

Yeah, HAH!
Gotta show what’s reclusive, implosive
With these metamorphosis, impostures with post-fortunes
From rappin’, makin’ it big
But I'm bringin’ you the raw fruit, no juice in this shit
That forces you to enhance your craft
But Egypt is hand in hand
The best quality although we have inequalities
So welcome to Egypt where every day’s a Ramadan
Cause we hungry for success
Striving to be the best
We are the real rap gods reincarnated from the graves
So if this rap game is a race
Then all you rappers are like joints
Me and my crew:
We'll be smoking and puff puff passing ya
We're makin’ it big same as NAMG
We're expanding now
Can't you see the stretch marks, I am
Afraid of heights, still wanna be at the top
Call it fucking the game missionary until the day my album drops
With my lifted vision I'm tryna make this land a better place
Portion by portion in partition
But they don't acknowledge my contribution
Saying it's diluted
And it's taken way longer for the fact a white rap kid like me
Is grasping, firing rhyming shots
My symphony of rhymes dropped with similes full of sympathy
On these rappers against us
With Arab League killing all these bitches with my verbal AK
Hanging with Sphinx, Kay and KD
And NAMG in the building it’s us
Egypt’s upcoming roster that’s who we be
Our history is proven to last
That’s what we’re doing right now, ha

(Verse 2: Mandou)

Tryna leave my mark on this planet before I vanish
I won’t kill your favorite rapper
But I promise I’ll leave him damaged
I know my mind is crazy, that’s something I cannot manage
And I know my thoughts are scary
It’s very normal to panic
I got some bars to show the world I’m a menace
I’m a wreckage and I’ll wreck it I see it and go and get it
I’m a legend
In this record, my nigga I’m gonna prove it
I’ma go slim shady on you motherfuckers, I’ma lose it
I need new haters; the old ones are liking me
Cause all of my dreams are turning into reality
See me chillin’ with the wolves homie fuck your dawgs
I’ma kill’em all; call it animal brutality
I don’t spit fire my spit is really acidic
So you better get to steppin’ when you see me in the civic
I’m comin straight out of Egypt
Well Cairo to be specific
Critics hatin’ on my lyrics
I know it’s too horrific
Yo it’s Egypt Vs. Everybody I’ll show you wassup
All we do is shit on rappers, we don’t give a fuck
So do you wanna ride or die
La la la la la la la laaa

(Verse 3: O-Kay)

I am the one and only
One of a kind
And the shit I spit
Is from the top of my mind
And the thing I’ve written
Is a hell of a rhyme
And the myth I bring
Is the best of the time
I walk through the dark in search for the light yeah
Try to recognize the wrong from the right yeah
I gon’ rise, capitalize, realize the real lies
No compromise even if it takes many tries
I ain’t afraid of my enemy pleasantly I’ll stand here
Breathlessly, my knees shaking violently
And I know if it’s meant to be
I gon’ die
And if it’s not
I gon’ rise

(Chorus)
You can get it if you want to
You and your whole crew
Never say what you won’t do
This is Egypt Vs. Everybody

(Verse 4: Sphinx A.K)

Simple and basic, I break the beat and rape it
Arabia is underrated on that first place shit
I gold medal rebel revolutionary, Islamic
The simple phrase dazes and raises a panic frantic
The age of the addict radical
Mathematical
Savage, manage to ravage, cause havoc
I damage language, vernacular, spectacular
Accurate hashashin’ shit
Blast and spit
Take the stash and dip, dash real quick
Laugh and grab my dick Haha
Hit a spliff of hash to it
Red leb ask for it
Put you on ya ass and shit, pass that shit
Flow’s on a acid trip
Mastered it, off the top rockin’ it
Reckless, from Cairo to Texas
Tyrannosaurus Rex with sand nikkas on the next shit
Dialect perfected, hip-hop resurrection
Middle East direction
Haters get the phruck off my erection
It’s a movement homie, Arab League till the end

(Verse 5: LKD)

Ayo it's Egypt!
Caught up in the storm and we're sea sick
Poverty's the norm for the hordes of the cheated
The lords and the leeches
Abhor it in speeches
But given their true form, they adore it in secret
That's a weakness
But let me switch to addressing this
Poor in our schools but are rich in our heritage!
In the midst of vanity-political apathy
We could rise like a salary, a chivalrous cavalry!
And pick up callously the thunder bolt in the stomach
Of future Buddha
Discover the new Bermuda with courage
Have to flourish in the ruins of a Lucifer's dungeon
Abusive destruction of music and elusive corruption
Using deduction concluded
Simply my dear Watson
Your assumptions aren't assuming enough
So fear Gotham
Cause it’s Egypt Vs. All, we ball with a dead heart
If it’s Egypt Vs. y’all, we'll give you a head start!

(Verse 6: Aly a.k.a Alistotle)

Huh, if I had to rhyme a line emphasizing my prime time
I’m bringin the bloodline of rappers in limelight
So scrutinize
As you witness the business, the rappers up in this horrendous, uplifting
I know; contradicting
For vengeance I do this
I fuck your appendix, my tongue ain’t pretentious
I stack influences, I rap I invent this flow
As dope as benzes
Go ask around it’s dangerous
Effin’ ridiculous how I’m reppin’ the city
Take pride in my upbringing
Step on the scene
And I’m treated like I’m nothing
Disbelieved in like a prophet
Best believe I rap non-profit
Best believe your bat I’m robbin’
Cause I have a thing for ugly
And I’m superman of rapping
Represent ‘til the death of me
The last breath in me
Till I have one lung, and I use that supsersonic speed
Racin through mazes a case of amazement I rap in the basement
The cupboard, the stairs and my head is a matrix
I’d die for my zion
We the gatekeepers
We have that locomotion, we say
Egypt is the motive
Picture us perfect, on stages and rich
And having oral sex with history
Cause we going down in this bitch, NAMG

(Chorus)
You can get it if you want to
You and your whole crew
Never say what you won’t do
This is Egypt Vs. Everybody

(Outro)
This is Egypt Vs. Everybody, yeah
Oh this is Egypt Vs. Everybody
Cause this is Egypt, yeah
Oh this is Egypt, yeah
Oh this is Egypt Vs. Everybody yeah
