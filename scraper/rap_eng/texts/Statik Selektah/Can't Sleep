[Verse 1: Havoc]
1-2, 1-2
Same shit, different toilet
Niggas hungry, believe me we ain't nothing to toy with
That real shit is on my mind like embroidery
So what friends? Ain't nothing without the loyalty
Bitch and a half seeing your homey fold
Shit is sad but you gotta let some homies go
Before they drag you, middle of the ocean no life vest
Them niggas not on my level, that shit is life-threat
Talking sideways, fuck you alluding to?
Not looking for no conformation, give a fuck what you would do
Hater-proof, hate me it'll ricochet
So how you wanna die, million of 'em, pick a way
Shit is realer more than ever, what you thought it was
Forcing 'em to do the dirt, you know we putting on the gloves
Gloves come out then the guns come out
Another quick jux, come on son, we out (come on)

[Hook]
Gave you niggas way too many passes
If I get knocked I pray to god this be my last bid
Niggas forced sometimes to tell me that I can't eat
All good make it where these niggas can't sleep
X2

[Verse 2]
Niggas pay attention when their livelihood threatened
Cause niggas ain't playing, send you back to the essence
Count your blessings if we ain't run up on you yet
Most likely we just waiting for the right connect
So fuck a piece, I need the lion's share
You see the roach's circle in the air that means I was there
Nothing but bodies in the wake of our presence
Conditioned to the code in our early adolescence
I'm the voice of the forgotten, somebody had to rep it
Soldiers on deck, ya'll niggas off message
Any weapon fired against me would never pop
In a nigga crib like the special ops
Your bitch out here giving up the box
And the keys, we ain't even have to pick a lock
You dolo in the crib, got word it's official
Why the fuck you think she even picked a fight with you?

[Hook]
