[Hook]
Harlem Blues
Harlem gettin money long time no cash
Harlem gettin money long time no cash
New nigga shinin might grind yo ass
Harlem gettin money long time no cash

[Verse 1 - Smoke DZA]
Classic DZA classic fit rubby tight nigga
Big dooby and some Henny white liquor
Nice niggas still exist in the East
Know us familiar rappers
But these niggas couldn't see me with welding glasses
Hit statika want bars I'll give you Attica
Hope you niggas got yo rhymes up
All stars down to the cats and the minors
Shin shizin in the airs of the world
Fuckin they minds up
Do I think I'm the shit? Hah you bet
Bet against DZA, be in more debt than the US
Foolish peons jumpin out the window like nutso
Playin theyself like Leon
Keep it cool nigga freon
Still on the bullshit I be on
Til a player hater be gone
Imma floss on you niggas
It's not Smoke, it's Kush God to you nigga
Pay homage to the realest

[Hook]
Harlem gettin money long time no cash
New nigga shinin might grind yo ass
Harlem gettin money long time no cash
New nigga shinin might grind yo ass

[Verse 2 - Smoke DZA]
I'm on my bucket shit
RL endorsements on my bucket list
Two "L"s up no Cool J
That's how I feel my life's ill
Played back it's like a highlight reel
I'm sayin gainin a life is how the high life feel
I'm sayin blood suckers tryna ride my wave
You payin? Money talks had the gold frank or hatchet on you
Polo sport P-Wing patch on you
Harlem slang dyou heard
I does dis
Everlastin doob lit for Hud 6
Ray Ray too killin Wu
Real right Harlem nights
Certified official it's only right I keep it real
Who the am I to fuck tradition up it's only right I keep it a buck
I'm from the home of the innovators
You niggas soap swaggin imitate us
Harlem

Harlem Blues
Harlem gettin money long time no cash
New nigga shinin might grind yo ass
Harlem gettin money long time no cash
New nigga shinin might grind yo ass
