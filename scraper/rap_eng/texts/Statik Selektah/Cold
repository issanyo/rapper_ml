[Hook: Jared Evan]
Because she's so cold
Because she's so cold, oh
Because she's so cold
In this cold cold weather

[Verse 1: Wais P]
Full length mink chinchilla collars
The game so cold cause we chasing our dollars
It's even colder, when there's diamonds on your shoulders
But Guess make is for guests, VS makers protect
All the bullshit I know I did you wrong
And I made you so cold, bitch, listen to this song
Roses used to move you, dinner use to groove you
Now you're so cold, only smile when you choose to
Ice bucket love refrigerator romance
You caught me smashing 2 hoes now I got no chance
You're so cold, so frigid, answer me I'm saying you
Ain't forgiving and I'm screaming "I'm pimpin"
Sipping hot tea, love bitches that's not me
Burberry scarf tied over, the fly rover
I think I damaged her, I use to manage her
It didn't work out no it's over and my hearts colder

[Hook: Jared Evan]
Cold, cold
Because she's so cold
Because she's so cold, oh
Because she's so cold

[Bridge: Jared Evan]
If the sun don't melt the snow
I guess you'll never know
What it takes to love, oh
If the sun don't melt the snow
I guess you'll never know
What it takes to love, me

[Verse 2: Wais P]
I'm addicted to it, shots of clear fluid
When it comes to these bitches baby I'm the truest
She ain't ready for it, listen to the chorus
Showing her off, her status like the average tourist
She's sophisticated, tell my momma I made it
I got a bitch that's so cold when I smoke she hate it
She ain't into jewels, she into property
She's a classy bitch but ghetto when on top of me
She be wilding out, 40 ounce, dialing out
Talking in tongues told me fuck her while I load my gun
Necklace very heavy, wrist watch blue berry
Let's put our business on the table baby you scary
Nothing but square feet, mafia rules
Square niggas can't get near me without permission
Need a pass to kill a pimp and that's the code
I'm pass the blow, fast to go hard on a hoe when she acting cold

[Hook: Jared Evan]
Cold, cold
Because she's so cold
Because she's so cold, oh
Because she's so cold
In this cold cold weather
