[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I am, I am
The man of the hour, I am
The man, you a coward, I am
Fresh out the shower, I am

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Uh, fresh dressed
Neat-pressed, naw
If I fall off, I get up and wipe myself off
I used to go to sleep cuddling a AR
Just the trials and tribulations
This the files I don't wanna open
They don't wanna see ya at the banquet
They don't wanna see you niggas make it
They don't wanna see that trophy, huh
I welcome yours with open arms
I give that lady a throat massage
I put your house in my fourth garage
Perpendicular ignorant cross with articulate
Southside, using Ben Franklin for benefits
Dirk Diggler with intent, like [?]
Kush for a supplement
I'm the reason Balenciaga had a waiting list
Please don't make me sign you up for the faking list

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I am, I am
The man of the hour, I am
The man, you a coward, I am
Fresh out the shower, I am
(I am) I am
The man of the hour, I am
The man, you a coward, I am
The man of the hour, I am

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
High as fuck off the joint that I just rolled
Riding round in a cloud of that kush smoke
Put my generation on the good dope
Now we all getting high as D'Angelo notes
Getting paid with each quote
Perfecting my game with each stroke
Tryna eat good and gain weight
Lame niggas wanna provoke us
Coincidentally I ain't broke
Into fashion but the weed is the only thing that choke us
I'm in my bag, God told me anything I want I could have
Anytime I want, I can brag
I be grinding, I don't relax
And real niggas gon' respect that
Nigga my passport full and I got jet lag
Homie, I am

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I am, I am
The man of the hour, I am
The man, you a coward, I am
Fresh out the shower, I am
(I am) I am
The man of the hour, I am
The man, you a coward, I am
The man of the hour, I am
(I am) (the man of the hour)
(I am) (the man of the hour)
(I am) (the man of the hour)
(I am) (the man of the hour)
