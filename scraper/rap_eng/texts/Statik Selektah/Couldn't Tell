[Hook: Black Thought]
I couldn't tell at first, when we fell in love
But I should have left alone like well enough
Trying to buy a dream, she was selling drugs
See thatâ€™s the irony like the smell of blood
Of our relationship, or whatever the hell it was
Keeps stinging, but I never let it kill the buzz
And first it hasn't hit you, then it does
I made the DJ promise to never play this record again because

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Before cellular phones were educated
And captured actual photographs that never faded
A DJ got a request to play the favorite record on the radio of his ex
But never played it and
Though the lady was vexed and devastated
She took a yoga lesson and stretched and meditated
And then created a curse that's dedicated to the most hating bitch ass nigga she ever dated
Tore through an entire library, one book at a time
Looking for rhymes, inspiration, some opening line
A marketing plan like having a Coke and a smile
Her heart in her hand, though passion had broken it down
She placed brick by brick like the China Wall
Cueing up the theater lights, before the monologue
Cancel the reservation at the Gansevoort
We got to start fucking with the condom more

[Hook: Black Thought]
I couldn't tell at first, when we fell in love
But I should have left alone like well enough
Trying to buy a dream, she was selling drugs
See that's the irony like the smell of blood
Of our relationship, or whatever the hell it was
Kept stinging, but I never let it kill the buzz
And first it hasn't hit you, then it does
I made the DJ promise to never play this record again because

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Picture the 80's Ethos on the east coast
Police, coke, weed smoke, government cheese toast
That's when I graduated out of the freak show
To grow up on the corner where the killers and creeps go to speak low, you know still waters is deep bro
The streets know somebody get a shot, it's free throw
If anybody hear gun shots, then it's beef though
Finito, everybody rolling with heat, 'sho
Side effects of the Zoloft, the guns go off
In the Dumbo Loft, for the amount jumbo caused
Before the prologue, oxygen and the lungs go lost
They said they never seen another head slump so hard
Or seen the people breaking out like the mumps so hard
Or ever seen a heart physically jump so far
At the service they never heard a song sung so hard
Till it was on the radio, the number one Showoff was playing
