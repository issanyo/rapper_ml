[Verse 1]
This a, link with legends, gone get you a beverage
Waitin on me to fail, get ya severance, or refund
Better shit every time lil homie this ain't no rerun
Head down thru trenches working until it's we won
I'm never out I'm always in my zone why you don't see em
But believe me the code is carpe diem
Cause each and everyday a nigga gotta to seize em
Chop game with OG's I call them convos Caesar
Gotta know a thing or two you'll end up rolled like pita
Cops deliver the news like cold pizza
Knock, knock, there's been a murder
Nobody seen nobody heard nun
We're on the verge of, self destruction
When the Pres gives instructions of hate
With no reluctance, no conscious, no substance
Can't watch the news cause that's troublin
So we make our own, I'm in my own world
So gone, so gone
At it with legends like statik, nigga, oh lord

[Chorus]
To tell you the truth not many real ones left
And all the legends held it down til they last breath
So I, Link With Legends, link With Legends
That's why I, link With Legends, link With Legends
Taught me not to slip and keep my right hand from my left
Do this shit big and do it til the death
So I, Link With Legends, link with legends
That's why I, link with legends, link with legends

[Verse 2]
I wish Pac was a love so I could chat with em
I wish B.I.G was alive so I could rap with em
Bring em both to puns crib just to mac with em
Talk about these green backs and get that with em
Old hunnids, young nigga wantin old money
Grandkids, kids will get to know money
Interfere and them wolves is at ya throat dunny
Where I'm from we need some bless up
Nas told me his Tec was on his dresser
And Hov fired shots when they put him under pressure
Abruptly make the exit cause they catch you, they gone keep you
Or crucify your presence, belittle you to the people
That's why when PAC died i woulda cried if I understood
That we was losing legends nurtured by, thru, and for the hood
That coulda taught us what was happening wasn't good
Just get the monies what a young nigga should
It's Understood
And when you eat ya people eat make sure ya people good

[Chorus]
To tell you the truth not many real ones left
And all the legends held it down til they last breath
So I, Link With Legends, link With Legends
That's why I, link With Legends, link With Legends
Taught me not to slip and keep my right hand from my left
Do this shit big and do it til the death
So I, Link With Legends, link with legends
That's why I, link with legends, link with legends

[Verse 3]
Pull up to ya city turn that bitch into a hotspot
So when I touch down I get connected like the wifi
Play me cross the tidal sounding crispy off the hifi
Don't speak much might of thought I was the side guy
Kuulin in the cut I go the hardest when I'm not tryin
You warmin up the bench I'm on the court homie start fivin
I kick game like I'm john Stockton
Scorin buckets and I'm not stoppin
And if the lane jammed I got my brothers with me waitin for the lob in
Run DMC thru queens wit the people got problems
Fabolous moves thru Brooklyn see homie we could solve em
Workin out L.I. like rakim if we gotta
Against all odds, mindframe of a shotta
Head all bad, I been sippin out the bottle
Foot on gas, like all I know is the throttle
Second is last and if you lose they forgot you
