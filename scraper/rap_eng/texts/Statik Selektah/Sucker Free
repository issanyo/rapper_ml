[Intro]
I got Statik's Jordans
Yeah, Lucky 7 huh, yeah

[Verse 1: JFK]
I'ma keep it me and keep the camera close
Six months, back in the unit, that nurse look like Amber Rose
Tight clothes and tight sweats, nice sweats
Life is kinda crazy, you never know what you might get
[?] me and Statik connect
Yeah, show off, show off, fucking with the right vet
(JFK) Working on my Kennedy tan
I'm a little smarter, boy, know of my enemies plan
Understand Lucky 7, Lucky Star
Some would say, "Hey, you don't know how lucky you are!"
Life is short, but I follow no matter where you go
There you are, there you are

[Hook]
Got to be, got to be be sucker free, sucker free
Got to be, sucker free, sucker free
Got to be, sucker free, free, free

[Verse 2]
I'm stressed, feeling blessed at the same time
It's a test that I pass, so I'm dying like the rest
Hit the gas [?]
But on the finish line what I call home
Sitting all alone
I'm not a video gamer
No deaths in the hanger
I'm like Revis, I'm a game changer
Stranger don't speak
Too many rhymes, too many geeks
I love hip-hop but this bitch don't love me
Hanging with humps and chumps, through bumps and downs
Haven't check her once, I'll call you a
See you next Tuesday, Thursday is her day
Fuck what a herb say
Truth, I speak beyond wordplay

[Hook]
Got to be, got to be be sucker free, sucker free
Got to be, sucker free, sucker free
Got to be, sucker free, free, free

[Bridge: D-Stroy]
What up humans?
This is not Hannibal Barbarus
This is destroy
Special Ed students call me D-Story
We here, hijacking this Lucky 7 album
Now we gonna play a special joint

[Verse 4: D-Stroy]
Up in the early rise and shine off my behind
Woke up like it's breakfast tea time
Shawty made omelettes, bacon bomb shit
I was late so I raced out of her mom's crib
Omelette dripping, olive juice sipping
In school, now my stomach starts tripping
Bubbling, it was all troubling
Girl I had a croissant so now that she's coming in
Fuck, damn, but she's don't know what I'm facing
I cut school and hit the train station
Lucky that the train came
Fuck I'm trying to maintain
Sweating in my clothes
Insane in the membrane
My best shot stayed at the next stop
I could find the best spot and just drop
Drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
It's all clear so I'm finding myself a spot
Did by the garbage, pants unbuckling
Didn't realize I was going on another man
Damn, he had the right to spaz
Homeless man chased as I wiped my ass

[Hook 2: D-Stroy]
I got to, I got to, I got to go (x3)
Hey, you just don't know man, you just don't know

[Verse 5: D-Stroy]
Before the club we grubbed on some waffles
After the club with a car full of falafel
Out the city on the center of the bridge
I swear I felt the bricks straight pressing on my ribs
Traffic's bad, backseat dash
Dropped my pants, held on a plastic bag
My boy driving, he straight gagged and gagged
People in traffic would just pass and laugh

[Pre-Hook x2: D-Stroy]
Yeah, I had to poop in there
Smelling mad funky, I'ma do this here
He's like "Yo, you stupid weird"
I'm tired of the bag, here's a souvenir

[Hook 2: D-Stroy]
I got to, I got to, I got to go (x3)
Hey, you just don't know man, you just don't know

[Verse 6: D-Stroy]
I never did it in my school cause the bathroom's busted
Walk around a fool without a toilet to be trusted
I think that girl that walked by crop dusted
See, that's some fool that I just can't fuck with
Once upon a time I hooked up on a new date
We at our crib eating chocolate souffle
Out of nowhere she argue with her roommate
She tell me to leave like it's getting to late
What? It had me all curious
I just got there, why so furious?
She said that this bastard bitch played a prank and shit
And mixed it with laxative

[Hook 2: D-Stroy]
I got to, I got to, I got to go (x3)
Something ain't right with this whole night
Go, Go, Go, Go, Go, Go
And I did behind a tree
I'm bout to go off the balcony
