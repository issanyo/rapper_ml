[Verse 1]
I know you can see the
Bucket of opportunity when it's raining
Dehydrated be givin' me dedication
I take at look at your bottle and then I look at my bottle
The only difference in mine is yours name brand
Any water to waste and I feel a pain
My crystal frame put me in situation to gain (sike)
It miss alot like driving behind a 14 wheeler in pouring rain
You understand what im sayin', right?
Beside the letter I am the coefficient
And ninety-seven percent of the water ain't good for drinking
We switched water way before in the beginning
Without a label attached
You probably won't know the difference (uh)
A chance close clockwise as soon as caps turn
Reverse cam lookin' forward to moving backwards
Your possibilities isn't from different fountains
They just puttin' a price tag on it and switch it outfits
Now it's awkward your agua tryna be the exact
It took a liter of my hope for me to react
You actin' like you gotta put the ingredients back
You think a flower give a fuck if it's Fiji or tap?
And people always assuming on everything
Believin' the animals will live longer with Poland Spring
Opportunities may dress different
But mine's ain't worth less
You wanna dehydrate work less

[Hook]
The Lord never put our lives in the same order
Never two of the same sides on the same quarter
I'm surefooted in my life ain't no damn sorta
And besides I don't need your name brand water

The Lord never put our lives in the same order
Never two of the same sides on the same quarter
I'm surefooted in my life ain't no damn sorta
And besides I don't need your name brand water

[Verse 2]
Look this world got me
Down to a couple ounces tryna preorder
Them new J's was about 10 gallons of water
The landlord gettin' plain sick of me
Cause my checks been goin' down the drain literally
Was sacrificing a shower
I get paid about a half a bottle an hour
That's not enough
Even when it's ninety degrees
Man that's hot enough
Caught you here cracking a voice
No Donald Duck, bottled up
I take a stroll with my last 50 milliliters
And seen a young kid ballin up in his ripped Adidas
Dehydrated in his form when he made 10 shots in a row
Gave him the water
You wanna hear the reason
And he was so damn thankful
The shoes all tangled
So i took my 2's off ankle
Knowing they won't fit
But you can trade them for gallons right now
So you can be hydrated to practice
Years passed and young boy drafted
I knew that it was in him he was so damn captive
Speaking on beliefs I know how you [? 2:20]
And he wore my shoes on his first career game
That's a real thang
Asked how I'm living and I say i'm living well
If you need a drink, knowin' I'm a living well
To those I give drinks to will never thirst
Yea, Bible said it first so I'm tryna be a [? 2:33]

The Lord never put our lives in the same order
Never two of the same sides on the same quarter
I'm surefooted in my life ain't no damn sorta
And besides I don't need your name brand water

The Lord never put our lives in the same order
Never two of the same sides on the same quarter
I'm surefooted in my life ain't no damn sorta
And besides I don't need your name brand water

[Verse 3]
Look, your opportunity no greater than mine
A total different environment i got my design
You only give one life it's up to you to decide
You diluting with water, die looting of mine
The steel that stood still reaching boiling points
A self esteem to the cloud that annoyed of the voice
Evaporating the air but really what do you care
And either way you compare I'm still seeing it clear
And yea, your opportunity no greater in worth
And sacrificing my own and people dying of thirst
You only get one life it's up to you to determine
You either closing or open, looking at it you turning
This still with good will why you frozen in ice?
And stinginess with your bottle, you ain't holding it right
My water eternal life, I swear I got it from Christ
It's handed over light you can't give it a price, it's light

[Hook]
The Lord never put our lives in the same order
Never two of the same sides on the same quarter
I'm surefooted in my life ain't no damn sorta
And besides I don't need your name brand water

The Lord never put our lives in the same order
Never two of the same sides on the same quarter
I'm surefooted in my life ain't no damn sorta
And besides I don't need your name brand water
