[Intro]
Life is resigned
Feel that shit baby
You drive me so crazy

[Hook]
Sometimes I just wanna be alone
Wanna talk to myself
When I'm at home

[Verse 1]
Just had to pay like 60 stacks in taxes
All this money I make, no thanks to federal bastards
Tell me why they take a piece of my assets?
Does Bill Gates have these same fees? Please I need the answers
Cause I think somebody taking advantage behind the camera
Watching, hoping I end up like Hammer or in the slammer
Tiny faults in my grammar, using anything to slander me
Looking at the calendar, can't wait to put an end to me
Bury my entities, hating only wastes your energy
Fuck negativity, I got love for all my enemies
Most are mini-me's, what they mean to me, minimal
My closet like a mini-mall and I'm expecting many more
The new millennials and the Indigos arrive
So it's about time for a changing in the tide
Let's put the drama aside and read between the lies
I'm in America screaming, "Who will survive?"
If only you could see through my eyes and perception
What it means to have this complexion
What it means to have these connections, to the most high
How it feels to have your two brothers in the sky
Sometimes I wanna cry, sometimes I wonder why
Sometimes I question God, can you blame me?
The sun ain't been shining here lately
And I swear it ain't the same cause

[Hook]
Everyday I think about you
Before I go to sleep, I pray I dream about you
Everyday I think about you
Before I go to sleep, I pray I dream about you
Sometimes I just wanna be alone, be alone

[Verse 2]
My creator had a master plan
Back when I was just an average man
Life was a snowball, an avalanche
I heard a inner voice say I still had a chance
So I found my self trapped in a no man's land
I felt a little tapped, smoked the whole damn gram
I took that to the face, now I'm on my way
It's on sight, only he been on my mind all day
Step up the plate when it's a fork in the road
Each spoonful of knowledge is a fortunate load
That's food for thought, a little salt in the cone
On the pineal, life is bitter sweet, but so perennial
We gotta move on from the ignorance and find resilience
Move in coherence, change appearance from the villain
Penicillin whenever this pen is spilling
They can't see what's really written, but they can feel my brilliance
They don't feel me though, they don't feel me
I swear they gon' know

[Hook]
Everyday I think about you
Before I go to sleep, I pray I dream about you
Everyday I think about you
Before I go to sleep, I pray I dream about you
Sometimes I just wanna be alone, wanna be alone
Wanna be alone
Sometimes I just wanna be alone, wanna be alone
