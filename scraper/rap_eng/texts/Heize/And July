English Translation

[Verse 1: HEIZE & DEΔN]
Did someone put drugs in it?
Yeah (I said it’s true)
In your normal voice
(I said it’s true)
I drink cold water
I drink bitter coffee
But it’s so sweet, why?
(I said it’s) killin me softly

[Verse 2: HEIZE]
From A to Z
All of your past
I know everything
So why am I being like this?

I can’t even say anything
I’m about to explode
It’s too late to say
That I’m saying this out of heat (what)
So I’m only lingering around you

[Chorus: HEIZE & DEΔN]
I can give you the world
If only you come to me
I can give you the world
Just say it
I’ll do anything for you yeah

(Ay yah ay, yeah ay yeah ay)

From the long spring
To the summer that just came
Thinking bout
You baby Yeah

[Verse 3: DEΔN]
A night hotter
Than the July sun
Like all weekends
It’ll probably coo down
But today, it’ll be different
All the emotions I pushed back
I’ll tell you today
I hope We’ll be ok

I pushed back the UMF tickets
That I’ve been waiting for
And I’m on my way to see you baby

I put on some perfume
I put on my expensive Jordans
Then I get a call from you
“I don’t think I can go out today”

[Chorus: DEΔN]
I can give you the world
If only you come to me
I can give you the world
Just say it
I’ll do anything for you yeah

From the long spring
To the summer that just came
Thinking bout
You baby Yeah

[Verse 4: DEΔN]
Among the coming and going people
I’m all alone
The fleeting night is comforting
(BUT) if it’s not today, I don’t think I can
So I’m pressing your phone number

If I hesitate more
I might see another girl next to you
So I’ll be careful
And I’ll tell you as if it’s not my story

[Verse 5: HEIZE & DEΔN]
I was denying it, saying I don’t know
Then two seasons have passed us
Even in this moment, I miss you
I need to be sure
Now stop

If I say it in May
I might seem impatient
If it’s next June
It’s obvious you’ll be busy

So I came this far
I know I’m not just a friend anymore
You already know
So what I’m saying is

[Outro: HEIZE & DEΔN]
You’re fine
I’m fine
And July

Oh the reason is enough BABY

You’re fine
I’m fine
And July oh (you know?)

“It’s better if I’m a guy”
