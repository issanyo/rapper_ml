[Intro: Emmy Mack]
(Been here for you
Listen to your heart)

[Verse 1: Kerser]
In a space of my own I spent days on the phone
Trying to make this shit happen, felt dazed and alone
Always blazing the cone, still king of this Oz rap
Next decade, tell ‘em chill, cos I got that
Quarter past four wine glass with some high notch
Bottles worth, more than what Sonya Mann’s fly watch
Someone questioned me the other day
They asked me was it worth it with all of the fuckin fame?
I had to think about it, still I don’t know
But if I didn’t rap I’d still be that one broke
But the fuckin fame, oh, man, the fuckin fame
Enough to make me want to hide and never make return to game
But it’s a life that I asked for, what to say
That wanna do shit and I just smashed the ottlebay
Thinking fuck rap, I’d rather live normal
Than that fucking cash sending me immortal

[Hook: Emmy Mack & Kerser]
Listen to your heart, when it’s tough we’ll get through
Listen to your heart, I’ve always been here for you
You know that I’m here, know that I’m there, I be there for you
Without a doubt, that’s my promise and I swear
Listen to your heart…

[Verse 2: Kerser]
I watch rappers come and I watch rappers go
But they all crawling back cos they realise it’s my show
And the label that we running, they be chasing for that dotted line
But you gotta be special if you thinking Scott'll sign
I’m writing this, penthouse on the balcony
Put myself in your shoes, I’m thinking how can he
Rise up, run shit like a true bosh
Shooters in my crew, so I’m set if they do cross
Pray every day, so I ain’t see my world messed
Holding shit down, but I stress when my girl’s stressed
All my crew stressed and we gotta move yes
Take our competition, we don’t beef on no computers
We keep it real, if you see me in the new whip
It means I got another park next to my other two
Nothing rented straight invested, I’m the smart one
Cash for life, got it pumping through my heart

[Hook: Emmy Mack & Kerser]
Listen to your heart, when it’s tough we’ll get through
Listen to your heart, I’ve always been here for you
You know that I’m here, know that I’m there, I be there for you
Without a doubt, that’s my promise and I swear
Listen to your heart, (got it pumping my heart)

[Verse 3: Kerser]
Man, this all spins me out, how I make it out C-Town
They call me king and get the crown
Got these haters facing down
And I’m howdy, pacing round, fuckin stage to stage
Doing show to show, switching flow to flow
And oh you know, I top charts without radio
And that include ARIA’s, don’t you say it so?
DVD’s, CD’s, number one
And when this drops, guaranteed number one
Have to brag, put these haters in their place
Rub it in a doubter’s face like I told you mate, I’m great
And what’s the Kers to do, oh god, it’s hurting you
I’ve got tricks up my sleeve, I could burst with news
Element of surprise, see your eyes and you cry
Cos you watched me from the fucking start and knew I had the drive
And that’s shit you need (shit you need)

[Hook: Emmy Mack & Kerser]
Listen to your heart, when it’s tough we’ll get through
Listen to your heart, I’ve always been here for you
You know that I’m here, know that I’m there, I be there for you
Without a doubt, that’s my promise and I swear
Listen to your heart
