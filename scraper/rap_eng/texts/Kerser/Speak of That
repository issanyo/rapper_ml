Pulled up in a nice car
New jeans new shoes lookin' nice huh?
Write raps on my iPhone
Got your bitch in the front she wants to drive home
I came quite a long way
I get paid cause the people that my song play
Touch down from a plane trip
Skinny cunt weigh heaps cause my name big
Ice cubes with the OJ
Codeine pop everything is okay
Haters trying to bring my name down
Won't happen cause they cannot match the fame now
And my earlobes glow nice
Tattoos home-job but they so right
Short hair with the three lines
My style yeah I'm rocking them on each side
Used to be a poor cunt
Wrote raps got paid now it's all love
I'm the come up never come down
Yeah you tell me who's looking like a bum now
Begging for a rap out
Rocky IV I'm 'bout to lay the smack down
Cleaner than a brand new
Do more for a brand than a brand do
G-shock that my wristwatch
Look down my time and they pissed off
Hat rest on the eyebrows
Street swag too hot better lie down
Out of hell like meatloaf
Green bag green smoke with the green notes
Loyal to my roots though
Came back to the hood with a true flow
Ride beats like a corvette
Hit stage make you wanna finish your set
Kerser inked on the jawline
Name so heavy that I kind of got a sore spine
Skill I'm the real though
Hurt cunts like a knife on a dildo
Take a stab and you lose quick
Real talk I ain't  even gotta do shit
Thick notes with a white stain
Cocaine marked up, stop the migraine
Got a joint in my smoke pack
Speak of that yo I think I'm gonna smoke that
Got bars that are too dope
Spit these and they leave you with a bruised throat
AB to the AK
Two 2's with a 5 what you say mate
You're girl wink her eye bah
I reply with a 'hi' and a 'bye slut'
Too good with the rap shit
One flick start a fire like a matchstick
Style what it is now
Told them stand up now they won't sit down
Fans know the G-O
Kers rap and he's simply in the beast mode
Hate me it's all good
I got a fuck load of fans for you it's awkward
My shit straight shines
Let it sink in
It might take time
Now I'm rocking big shows
Sell 'em out fucking oath watch me spit flows
So clean sick yes sir
Raps my bitch you wish I never met her
Fuck her and I get paid
You pay to fuck
So press play
Ride just behind the bass bitch
Earphones hurt head like a facelift
Cause I speak too toxic
Put your track next to this you ain't got shit
Kick flows like a psycho
That's magic from hitting notes on my phone
