[Verse 1]
I told 'em two drinks here, I'ma sit and just think
And tell you bout me coming up while I'm sipping my drink
Well, it started with Boobz, sixteen, smokin' freestyle
You're probably wonderin' why he's not on tour, meanwhile
There's a lot behind the story, let me break it down
Boobz didn't want the fame or he'd be tourin' with me now
He told me "Scott, fucking make them bucks"
And now to every cunt, he's never asked to take em but
He got me into this shit so it prove he legit
Remember showing Rates my first track like "what do ya think?"
He gave me confidence and told me "fuck, you got it, you're sick"
Around this time me and Boobz were popping a mix of pills
To knock us out and we were young as a kid
Breaking into portables for a few hours sleep
When the hottie broke down, what a way we would live
Before the brakes didn't work, almost fucking collid and died

[Hook]
What a way that we came up and no one
Could see us takin' over rap but we owe one
To every fan that's supportin' our shit
To every fan that ever followed, let me walk you through this
What a way that we came up and no one
Could see us takin' over rap but we owe one
To every fan that's supportin' our shit
To every fan that ever followed, let me walk you through this

[Verse 2]
I started rappin' with Newt, he was reppin' up Minto
We called ourselves Jinxed Wings, we had a bit of a trio
Rates was killing the rhymes, we knew shit was gonna get big
And Jay was rapping at the start, man he had the fresh shit
I wonder if God has got some sort of a prob
I remember those bars, you inspired me a lot
Newt stayed graffin', Boobz started chillin'
Kers, Rates and Jay, we were ready for the killin'
Broke as fuck but I hustled for my high mate
Round the time we were pushing shit on Myspace
Mixtape out, digger paid for the shit
It was eighteen tracks of the craziest shit
For it's time anyway, kill the mic any day
Sippin' lean, thinkin' bout my past, pop a annyxay
Nebulizer was the first chart climber
Hit the drugs hard at that time, man that's a reminder

[Hook]
What a way that we came up and no one
Could see us takin' over rap but we owe one
To every fan that's supportin' our shit
To every fan that ever followed, let me walk you through this
What a way that we came up and no one
Could see us takin' over rap but we owe one
To every fan that's supportin' our shit
To every fan that ever followed, let me walk you through this

[Verse 3]
From there the highest viewed YouTube rapper in Aus
We would sit around, just Jay, Aaron and Scott
They was getting a buzz, the shit was getting like shit hot
Going on tour, not knowing we got ripped off
Then I changed my management, had another crack at it
And sold out every state and topped the charts now we back stackin' it
It happened so fast, but fuck it was ten years
I've got those fucking rhymes that can make grown men tear

[Hook]
What a way that we came up and no one
Could see us takin' over rap but we owe one
To every fan that's supportin' our shit
To every fan that ever followed, let me walk you through this
What a way that we came up and no one
Could see us takin' over rap but we owe one
To every fan that's supportin' our shit
To every fan that ever followed, let me walk you through this
