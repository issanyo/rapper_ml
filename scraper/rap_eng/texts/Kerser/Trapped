[Verse 1: Fortay]
Hard to guess where to my brain, harness the stress
Can't make moves and not be a target I guess
Can't start to break through without leaches and fakes
Hatin' you for what you do trynna eat off ya plate
Started West sparkin' esh, well then a artist I guess
Porn stars couldn't fuckin' come harder than F
There's no waitin', so I gotta drop tracks hurry
Lackin' patience, like I'm doctor Conrad Murray
These rappers hate it, comin' with their backward statements
But I'm seeing these actors fakin'
Been the truth and captivatin'
For so long, through the stage of progression
No one paying for my songs but they payin' attention
Don't blame me if I mention that knowledge ain't free
Teachin' shit you won't learn in a college degree
They wanna follow me please, do you listen to the raps?
I don't do this cause I can, I do this cause I'm trapped

[Hook: Fortay]
It's a trap, stress got me goin' insane
Find me trapped, cause all I know is the game
Trapped, tryna figure friends from the foes
So I'm trapped, more than you ever will know
Trapped, stuck on a mission to ball
Trapped, gotta fuckn' give it my all
Find me trapped, escapin' through the rhymin' of words
So I'm trapped, like my life in the verse

[Verse 2: Kerser]
Life got me trippin', feelin' stuck in a trap
It's like I found my one escape and that is bustin' a rap
Got some boys in a cell and they ain't doin' too well
They facin' half their life so far until they movin', I dwell
On the days where a charge would just sink like a light beer
Now I need permission just to visit for five years
Life in the trap, yeah they call it a ghetto
And that's every where from Mac all the way to Rosemeadows
C-Town represent 'till the day that I die
Is it wrong I wanna leave and stay away here for life?
But then I seem like a change, nah he ain't the same
So I can't get away from the streets and the gangs
I'm with Fort in the West, spit raw to the death
We don't play no Aussie Hip-Hop, brick wall leave 'em fenced
And we on to the next one, life in the trap
Sick as Ivan Milat, fuckin' knife in ya back, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Defiant]
Yo I'm trapped in Syn City doin' fucked up things
Man I'm still cheatin' life for the pleasure it brings
So bad to the point I'm not even feelin' guilty
They consider me the scum of the earth, for livin' filthy
Some bitches get their hearts broke, fuckin' with death
Get drunk, jump in bed over somethin' I said
All my friends know I'm a low life, perverted and real
This is it I put it down, fuck the commercial appeal
And fuck the world, you know it's all the drama
We pray and still suffer, it's like the Lord doesn't want us
Grew up with nothing more, than a mother's support
No respect for the law, Babylon's corruptin' our thoughts
So bad that some kids might even slash their wrists
Tryna figure out life, we need some answers quick
A cocktail of drugs, alcohol and cancer sticks
Hip-hop pornographic material and gangsta shit
Got you, fantasizing and playing the role
Yeah it's all fun and games until one of us lay in a hole
Goin' to hell, who's real, time only will tell
I need out, my and myself, fuck everyone else
