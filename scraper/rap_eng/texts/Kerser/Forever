Forever in my mind, only you
The pieces in my life, go away with you
Forever in my mind, only you
The pieces in my life, run away with you
Forever in my...

[Verse 1]
They all the same they just lame with their bullshit
It's kinda sad cause you trust 'em but they drool shit
Enough to make me wanna fucking turn my mic off
And go back to being poor at 16 and never write songs
Cause back then I ain't have all these eyes judging
I was hanging on the street, getting searched for nothing
And they spin out cause I'm on a track like "Fuck 'em"
Like I will forget my past and what they did? Nah ain't like none of 'em
Fuck the 5-0, I'm lighting hydro
You can tell me about the bisso but what I know
Cause on the street there ain't none of this industry
Until I brang it to the industry like this is me
Respect me for that, it's all I really ask for
And we be getting raided by a fucking task force
For years now they went and locked my mates up
My money clean but they still won't go away fuck!

[Hook]
Forever in my mind, only you
The pieces in my life, go away with you
Forever in my mind, only you
The pieces in my life, run away with you
Forever in my...

[Verse 2]
Nothing changed but my attitude man
Make cash when I had a new plan
Kids looking up to me, what the fuck am I meant to say?
Its not as hard as it was for me
They shut the door but I kicked it in, I come for more
They knock you down you won't get help
Rise to the top tell 'em fuck yourself
Cause they gonna hate you when you poor as shit
They look, they laugh, ignore your shit
And you gonna feel down you'll wanna quit
But you gotta fucking fight if you want the shit
And you're at the top its not as sick as you pictured it what's wrong with This
Why people turn my mates have changed
Why you thinking shit would stay the same
Stupid man I'm trying to guide the next Kerser
But Imma tryna hide from all the shit that comes with rap
Back on the street with a baggy dacked
Cause the fame ain't sunk in yet (the fame ain't sunk in yet)
In a brand new car I think the fame has fucked my head
But gotta keep control and run this shit
100k another 100 flip
Ever doubt me you can suck my dick
I ain't even know what a budget is
Fuck the scene, have your hip-hop
Skitsing out you got me pissed off
Ain't no love my heart is switched off
Got my back well fuck I guess not

The pieces in my life, go away with you
