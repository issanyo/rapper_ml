[Chorus]

[verse 1]

Bunch of robots in a race they dont know where they going tho
Doing what they told, brain washed like they knowing so
Thats why im fucked up living how my mates live
I hope that 9 to 5 make you feel like you made it
Then coppers do and the government can die slow
Hi no im happy sitting back watching time go
Its what it is and what it is i can see through
What you do cause what you do is what we do
Not today man im feeling the stress
As i try block it out and not deal with the mess
You ever popped this pop that, dropped this what lad
Open up my eyes and realize ive been shot back
People think i make this up and i dont do shit
Look into these eyes and tell me i ain't being true bitch
From the heart from the dome im just being real
Ripped apart bone to bone i can barely feel

[Chorus]

[verse 2]

I'm not like the majority i'm kinda way different
Starting with the fact that im kinda way gifted
I reckon you back stab, these memories flash back
The end of the track smash, defending the lads that
Ain't got a dollar or a cent to get a feed or the kids who ain't got shit and sneak and sleep under sea saws
Keep your head up brother kersers here and understands
I understand if theres never been another plan
Fuck the robots why you caring what they thinking bro
Why you even stop to pay attention to a freaking clone
Plan to escape i got my hand in the gate
Pick the padlock, pop now the mans on his way
I can't handle it wait, why you gotta go for?
The old man who see me now he probably go to war
This ain't right i take flight with a pipe without a sedative
I guarantee that its a late night

[Chorus]

[verse 3]

Everywhere i go its always kerser what the up bro
People ask me this but i dont think they give a fuck tho
Tablet with a  lift so the codeine's the gift
I pop shit like this and it ain't cause im sick, nah
Its to get so high that i can't spit a word out
Pop one through the chorus i will hope i get the third out
Brain gone, eyes straining to move
I hade a plan now i lost what im aiming to do
I stay making the move i could break you in two
Dont be hatin' its true, its what greatness would do
I bought a mix quick/[?]  with the shit that i spit
Along with what im on and im addicted to this
Now resistant and shit thats got my wrist in the hand cuffs
Paddy wagon swerving i ain't trying to stand, uh
Living life by the rodes on my note pad
You know its fucking real if kers the man that just wrote that

[Chorus]
