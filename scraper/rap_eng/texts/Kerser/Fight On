[Verse 1]
Fuck it, where do I start?
Do I make a remark about my life in the dark?
And all the shit they don't know, like I'm a fucking addict
Tragic that it worked out this way, had it happened any other way, I would've spat it
But I'm just laying around
Vision blurry, I'm not happy, 'nother pill, if not
They carry me to hospitals and have feeling like a fucking junkie
But they ain't been through what I've been through, how the fuck they judge me?
Plus I'm only on the downers, is what I tell myself
Like, the highs was any lower, I should belt myself
And all this time I've been working with rap
I don't talk to many people cos they circles of rats, fuck
Lose my mind when I think into shit
And every pill that I pop, memories sink and dismiss
Whats the difference I spit like there's a gun to my head
Leave my life in the booth feels like a struggle for breath

[Hook:]
Gotta fight on ain't no way to beat me
Feel like I'm locked away somebody gotta free me
I'm just looking out the ocean as the waves break
And back at me and Boobz were eating off the same plate
We had a dream you told me man you gotta chase that
In Australia you know I came and saved rap
To where I was then to where I am now
It's a miracle 'cause rapping like my pen pal

[Verse 2:]
Keep yourself together, will the fans ever dismember?
I fluke around my clever no one's snooping through what better
That's my confidence boost after popping a few
At least I'm honest to you but fuck a promise I'm through what?
Is that letting them down?
After six albums in they can't question the crown
And it's crazy that I'm still at the front
I was popping a hundred and eighty six Xanax a month
And that was six a day now I'm currently confused
Come on, take it back tell me what was the wrong move
People ask me if I've beaten it yet
Cause I've had heaps of fucking help is there a reason to stress?
Trying to get my teenage years like they never left
But they gone fucking Scott get it through your head
Maybe I ain't ready for the world just yet
Gotta take a pill to handle all the success

[Hook:]
Gotta fight on ain't no way to beat me
Feel like I'm locked away somebody gotta free me
I'm just looking out the ocean as the waves break
And back at me and Boobz were eating off the same plate
We had a dream you told me man you gotta chase that
In Australia you know I came and saved rap
To where I was then to where I am now
It's a miracle 'cause rapping like my pen pal

[Verse 3:]
So I'm hitting the road and a brave face for the stage
And no one's taking my place they never hate to my face
I could've fell into bits but I'm too strong for this shit
I got a long list ticking off all of what I can get
Ain't been wrong yet shit I give you my life
And social medias a joke it's how you live in your mind
But me I'm in the real world still repping C-Town
Even though I moved and I'm living by the beach now
To my girl, Jesus Christ, how I thank you
You watched me fall, you were there, you never break, you
Helped me up when my legs fucking gave way
You was holding me in hospital the same day
I cave ways for these rappers do they understand?
It's obvious I'm rocking gold they rocking rubber bands
I'ma fight through everything I've come against
I'm a winner, thought you knew it, don't you come and test

[Hook:]
Gotta fight on ain't no way to beat me
Feel like I'm locked away somebody gotta free me
I'm just looking out the ocean as the waves break
And back at me and Boobz were eating off the same plate
We had a dream you told me man you gotta chase that
In Australia you know I came and saved rap
To where I was then to where I am now
It's a miracle 'cause rapping like my pen pal
