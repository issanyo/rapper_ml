[Intro]
Man
The amount of people that have come into my life then left
Came back, left again
Talked shit, tried to come back again
Tried to use me for money
Tried taking advantage of my kindness
Tried switching sides
Tried tellin' me they'd always be down for me
But the people talk down to me
I just wanna say there's no hard feelings
Only 'cause I won
Check

[Verse 1]
Had to guts a couple cunts off, it wasn't nothing personal
It felt like I left my brain at a terminal
Sometimes I gotta get away from the spotlight
It feels like your freedom gone and you hold tight
And you just pushing for the final result
Like me when No Rest dropped I felt I'm finally on top
You got to fight through the dark days, they looking even darker
You focus on the now, you gotta focus on the after
That's the thing I learned, think I contradict myself
I'm so lost in this game, I could shoot myself
I've got to got to get my head clear, it's feeling fogged up
We was trippin' when I made it, yeah it shocked us
Even though I put the plan into process
Every rapper seen me winnin' yeah, it's progress
I make moves every year that are top notch
In case you're wondering why I got the top spot

[Hook]
In it for the long haul, ain't a way to turn back
If I got it then it's proof that I earned that
Trying to find a place stress don't exist at
Where my mind can turn off and just kick back
It ain't found yet, I'm lookin' on the bright side
The time goes quick, I'm watchin' it fly by
But on me and I'm here until the end, yeah
Check the history, Kers set the trend, yeah
My first step I was chasin' up history
My second step I was learnin' how to get get cream
My third step, had it mastered, it was easy
My fourth step, at the top is where you see me
My fifth step was my best step, "Next Step"
My sixth step was the sickest shit yeah
Step seven you are listening in
I guess it's step eight where I see you again

[Verse 2]
Overcome everything to get where I'm at
Will the next generation be reminded of that?
Or will I be another rapper on a broken record?
That's impossible because I went and broke the records
And the blueprint, they all start to use shit
Which is cool, just remember who was doin' it
I set the path first you ain't got to ask nerds
I'ma be me, probably be my last words
Feel the beat, feel the flow, got the flavour
I fell in love with this before I made it major
And you can ask anyone who knew me back then
I was sayin' I'ma make it with the rappin'
Had the passion, the force of a tidal wave
So fuckin' oath, I deserve to have the shine today
Is it worth it? I'ma let you judge though
Most days, your answer endin' with a fuck no

[Hook]
In it for the long haul, ain't a way to turn back
If I got it then it's proof that I earned that
Trying to find a place stress don't exist at
Where my mind can turn off and just kick back
It ain't found yet, I'm lookin' on the bright side
The time goes quick, I'm watchin' it fly by
But on me and I'm here until the end, yeah
Check the history, Kers set the trend, yeah
My first step I was chasin' up history
My second step I was learnin' how to get cream
My third step, had it mastered, it was easy
My fourth step, at the top is where you see me
My fifth step was my best step, "Next Step"
My sixth step was the sickest shit yeah
Step seven you are listening in
I guess it's step eight where I see you again

[Outro]
Overcome everything to get where i'm at
I fell in love with this before I made it major
And the blueprint they all start to use, shit
Just remember who was doing it
