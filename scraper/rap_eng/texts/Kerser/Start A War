[Verse 1: Kerser]
Look at my name, Look at my fame
Came a long way had my foot in the drain
Look I’m the same, you’ll get pushed in your face
If you try to snap a photo when I’m looking away
Cooking your brain I’m not paying for this
Making big coin off covers off an iPhone bitch
That’s more than you, and your album too
Stop bragging like your earning off music dude
It’s a shame when they lose ‘cause I always win
Everyone says take over, hold it in
I’ve heard them all say it ten times before
They can’t get near me man they make me bored
I hate ‘em all, I’m just stating facts
You getting lap to lap like a racing track
You can hate some more, I’m the holy sound
Blessed by God, let me hold it down
Amen

[Hook:]
Pick it up now we the kings of this
Ripping up town when we hit the gigs
Spitting that sound, they addicted quick
What they gonna do? They can’t quit the shit
Throw ‘em all in, now they want some more
If I go quiet then they start a war
They want our sound ‘cause we save them all
Back to the boredom, getting payed galore

[Verse 2:]
Look at my chain, Look at me main
Don’t stare too long, you’ll get hooked with a blade
They my boys and they paranoid
And they don’t trust you, you don’t have a choice
So don’t stand too close if you’re arking up
You’re a dog check the tree you’re barking up
Back by the best, ABK for life
Plus I got some close friends that are out on bikes
Enough of that, now back to rap
And fuck Drake too, I’m going back to back
Topping charts is just what I do
Radio still hating, try to block the crew
On top of yous we rock it through
To any of my gigs, What you popping dude?
Kerser one, it’s album six
Still ghetto, with a pounding stitch

[Hook:]
Pick it up now we the kings of this
Ripping up town when we hit the gigs
Spitting that sound, they addicted quick
What they gonna do? They can’t quit the shit
Throw ‘em all in, now they want some more
If I go quiet then they start a war
They want our sound ‘cause we save them all
Back to the boredom, getting payed galore

[Bridge:]
ABK
We run this
Stay away
We done shit

[Hook:]
Pick it up now we the kings of this
Ripping up town when we hit the gigs
Spitting that sound, they addicted quick
What they gonna do? They can’t quit the shit
Throw ‘em all in, now they want some more
If I go quiet then they start a war
They want our sound ‘cause we save them all
Back to the boredom, getting payed galore
