Ah fuck
You got a camera again!

[Verse 1: Kerser]
Fucks happening
Yeah it's been a minute
Dick inside the box
I think I left my semen in it
Aye lad
It's that time of the year
On stage, new watch and the shiniest ears
I'm rocking Melbourne first
This time around
In the CBD, just drivin' 'round
When I hit that stage in Melbourne man
There ain't many that compete with Melbourne fans
They pumped as fuck, they jumping up
They know the king, gon' fuck shit up
V.I.P in the V.I.C
Melbourne go hard, I might D.I.E
It's the Kers, I could make a nun pop her dress
If I put it in her bum, am I holy blessed ?
Next up is Sydney man
My hometown shit, I got the sickest plan
You should spit it loud, while I'm spitting it proud
Rates and Jay on stage throwing pingas to the crowd
Uh, hold up, we might get banned
That big jet plane, just might not land
Before we crash more, please let me end my joint
King Kong shit, swinging off centrepoint
So dope I'm the colder, open the whole bar
While I'm kicking back having coke with that cola
Then I'm off from Syd to Bris
Big signs when I land like the sickest is, here
Ask shit
The Q.L.D, gonna go so nuts from the new LP
And I bet mother fucking, ready steady raise the roof bruh
Fucking am I dreaming ? Cause I'm beaming in a new car
In a new state, with a few mates, on stage in Bris, with the new pay
Punchline, fuck that ima rack one
Can't afford my album, go to stores and fucking dack one
That ain't the end yet, I got some great shit
I got some bitches throwing bras on the stage, shit
I'm up here with Rates and Jay, and state to state, it's still A.B.K
Uh
Bring me back down to earth, they said I'm lost, fucked up and I'm down in Perth, shit
Where to go, cause I'm late to the show, in Perth, swear mums it's the craziest bro and I left my mind there, like a couple of times
If you find it let me know, what the fuck can I rhyme
Now I'm in Fremantle, west of Aus
Where the pills are popped and the energy hot
Party from the sun up, party when the sun down
Then I'm meeting Adelaide with another comedown
But it's all good, cause the bud here
When I land, have the dealer with the truck here
Screaming "fuck yeah", this the life brah
So smooth, so fresh, looking nice huh
See me live bruh, it's the best shit
Throwing ice at the crowd, going hectic
Cunts getting cut up in the moshpit
Only joking get your tickets from Oz Tix
They blame me, saying I'm a bad guy
I'm just looking for some head, like a magpie
More dates on the way, hitting Tas to
Don't ask why, I'm just feeling like I have to
Newcastle love the king
When I hit that stage with a hundred spliff's
And just throw to the crowd, when they get kicked out
Then I rock it in the street, that's how they knew we getting down
Say you gonna shoot, you aim for me
I gotta a pound underground, in da A.C.T
I'll share mother fucker, I'll pass it around
As I leave, drive by's on the Parliament House, huh
King dropped, and it topped the charts
But it happens every year, we told em from the start
Get your tix now, you can call it promo
I should have a dollar sign as my logo
King dropped and they saying it's the best yet, cop your tickets, see ya there, DEADSET !

I'm feeling on the of the world again
And yo Nebs, we've done it again
Go cop that album King
See why it went number 1
And so, you know the go
I'll see ya's at the show
It's time to party
Kerser, Nebs - we out
