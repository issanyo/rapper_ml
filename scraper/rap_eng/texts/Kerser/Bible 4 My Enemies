[Intro:]
Kerser
I'm just chilling in the studio with Nebs
You know turch
Never know you down like this, Look

[Verse:]
ABK heard that clique
Even coppers getting stomped squashed at the gigs
I've learned a lot in the last past five years
I can get your brain shot grab your mum wipe tears
'Cause when you make it to a certain success
You got the boys in the street who want to come with you, yes
So in order for that, that's how they're paying me back
To fuck you up on any circumstances, play with me lad
This ain't a gangster act, not by any means
This the bible for my enemies
I'll leave a legacy behind they can blame me
The first Oz rap to bring the street to the mainstream
And I ain't main stream, but it's strange see
As many people sussing that seem to play me
Ninth wonder of the world, you can lock it in
Read the bible, even close it says I'm gonna win
Says I gotta win, you a ought to been
I'm a fresh motherfucking rocking solid bling
You won't understand if you ain't come up like I did
That's why we laughing when these young-in's fucking biting this
I'll have a stub nose put to your grub nose
Plan the shit perfect even coppers thinking "fuck knows?"
My boys crazy and they wiling out
If you diss me man I hope that they don't find you out
You'll be six feet under that's a final round
And I don't give a fuck if you want vinyl sound
'Cause we group up and we learned in a violent town
No disrespect but this shit ain't the 90s now
This a whole new era I'm the king of it all
You gotta move with the times or get evicted and walk
We gonna bully all these rappers cos they softer than a waterbed
Said you wanted war instead, man you should've thought ahead
Street shit, backed by the best
X on your chest, hacked to your death
Kers, Rates, ABK and a bunch o' 'nother cunts
225 signing out, didn't think we running up what's up?

[Outro:]
[?] 225
[?] ... sickest cunt out there
If they spit a diss to Kers [?], fuck 'em
[?] maximum security jail
And what?
Cunt we hate these fuck wits
Bitches 225
All the way
