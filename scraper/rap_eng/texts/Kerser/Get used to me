[Hook:]
I ain't going nowhere, I ain't ever leaving
Get used to me, I'm the host for this evening
Hoe stop your screaming, I can see your beaming
See me in real life, got you thinking that your dreaming
I ain't going nowhere, I ain't ever leaving
Get used to me, I'm the host for this evening
Hoe stop your screaming, I can see your beaming
See me in real life, got you thinking that your dreaming

[Verse 1:]
I'm getting tired man, they're biting all my shit truth
They punch them self, they even try get my chipped tooth
I'm the man to fresh for a fist fight
I thrown em up but I'd rather see a clip fly
The sick guy, I'm back at again
Took your girl by the hand cos she said I'm the man
Rappers be aware now your under attack
If you're riding shot gun you got one in the back
I got April in the front, I told her this the plan
The boys are gonna fight film the shit from Instagram
I don't give a fuck, damn, she don't give a fuck neither
Soulmate status shit, let 'em catch a breather
I'm the cunt that got rich from this rap shit
I'm that cunt looking fresh always matching
ABK got ammunition and they lunatics
Don't get your self hurt over rapping stupid shit

[Hook:]
I ain't going nowhere, I ain't ever leaving
Get used to me, I'm the host for this evening
Hoe stop your screaming, I can see your beaming
See me in real life, got you thinking that your dreaming
I ain't going nowhere, I ain't ever leaving
Get used to me, I'm the host for this evening
Hoe stop your screaming, I can see your beaming
See me in real life, got you thinking that your dreaming

[Verse 2:]
Kers one, new swag when my stock up
Fucking oath, they play my music in the lock up
Cos they relate and know the system is fucked
Same mindset as me wanna shiv up the jugs
Now, who said i went pop? Are you fucking serious?
It's a pop, pop, bang if she on her period
Fuck a pop star I'm a rapper with an attitude
Sky dive with a grenade and a parachute
How many victims did i take out this time?
If you could read the thought going through this mind
Woke up with a blunt that was half lit
Took a puff getting sucked on my hard dick
I'm the Kerser one you never forget
I'm the Kerser one forever respect
I made history lad and that's true, fact
The music scene wasn't ready that's to bad

[Hook:]
I ain't going nowhere, I ain't ever leaving
Get used to me, I'm the host for this evening
Hoe stop your screaming, I can see your beaming
See me in real life, got you thinking that your dreaming
I ain't going nowhere, I ain't ever leaving
Get used to me, I'm the host for this evening
Hoe stop your screaming, I can see your beaming
See me in real life, got you thinking that your dreaming

[Verse 3:]
You witness me blow up see me pick my flow up
And I'm still celebrating, finally got my dough up
Driving in my city, got a luxury car
I ain't ever backing down, I give a fuck who you are
And I got a group of mates, I give my life to them
The same cunts that will pop you and do five to ten
For me, facts what I'm spitting out rap who the sickest proud
Used to love the rap, gotta say its kinda different now
It's hard out here 'til i made my tracks pop
I'm down to take photos but I fear a snap shot
On my head that's a fear that I live with
The past year the kids got guns and dig shivs

[Hook:]
I ain't going nowhere, I ain't ever leaving
Get used to me, I'm the host for this evening
Hoe stop your screaming, I can see your beaming
See me in real life, got you thinking that your dreaming
I ain't going nowhere, I ain't ever leaving
Get used to me, I'm the host for this evening
Hoe stop your screaming, I can see your beaming
See me in real life, got you thinking that your dreaming
