[Intro: Nebs & Kerser]
This better be a fuckin’ good party
Got a good party, yeah
Yeah, brah
Oi, is that a fuckin’ whistle man?
What the fuck are you doin’ that for?
Shit, ‘cause I love it, bruz
Sweet
Oi, where’d you get those fuckin’ shorts, brah?

[Verse 1: Kerser & Nebs]
Yeah, zinc on my face, I’m in tennis shorts
Why you wearing jeans Nebs? Get in yours
You told me this party was a place to be
But there’s forty-four trannies and they’re chasin’ me
Yeah, wait and see, I got fluoro sticks
You know this, there’s a few grown chicks
Ah, man, hands in the air
Look right there, covered in hair
[?] got me shakin’ my hips
Wrong place, wrong time and I’m takin’ a shit
How hot am I? I’ll rock tonight
But it looks like someone squashed a pie
And I’m back in my shorts and her tits dancefloor
Yellin’ at [?] “Why you wear pants for?”
Nebs, come on, I know we’re superstars
But that whistle ‘round your neck looks stupid brah

[Chorus]
You know we party like this
You know we do it like that
And when we do it like this
We know you bitches like that
You know we party like this
You know we do it like that
That’s why we’re talking like shit
We know you bitches like that

[Verse 2: Nebs & Kerser]
Why do you think I blow this whistle?
(Why?) Them gronks can smoke my whistle
Hey Kerser, thanks for the tennis shorts
Now I’m ‘bout to get some sex for sure
Nah, I’m just playing, didn’t come here to get a root
Nebs, what you doin’ in the kitchen? Making fresh soup
Then I lace it with gear
Feed it to these bitches, Satan is here
Who’s who? Party wearin’ a headband
Have you seen that chick? Now the hooks like Redman
No, if she don’t try my soup, she’s a dead man
I make that shit fresh from the can
I put a daybreak drug
In your drink but I drunk it myself
You were pretty hot, I was meant to fuck you
But now I’m fuckin’ myself

[Chorus]
You know we party like this
You know we do it like that
And when we do it like this
We know you bitches like that
You know we party like this
You know we do it like that
That’s why we’re talking like shit
We know you bitches like that

[Outro: Kerser & Nebs]
Oi Nebs, where’s the DJ bruz?
Out the back, lad
Oi, there’s too many metro aggots in here
Skinny jeans and V-necks and shit
Gronks
Yeah, well, we gotta change the atmosphere a bit
Tell me about it brah
Yeah, you got that beat? Esyay
Yeah, give it to the cunt
Let’s do it
Excuse me DJ
Could you chuck this beat on for us, brah?
