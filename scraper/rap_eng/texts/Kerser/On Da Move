[Verse 1]
Never forget who the king of the shit
I can make your eyes hurt with a flick of my wrist
Swag out proper it's ridiculous shit
Cricket bat to your head, yeah, I hit it for six
None sicker than this, I write rhymes over any style
Reppin' ABK fuckin' oath, it's been a while
My lyrical skill has got 'em fearin', I'm ill
Drinkin' beer and I chill after eatin' a pill
Woah, so ill with it, put me in the quarantine
Rap a circle 'round rappers, we all got a dream
Got out my weapon pokin' out my fuckin' Gucci shirt
Never lackin', I got enemies, I'm too alert
You should see when I pull up in my Range Rove
It's my second one, I treat 'em like a paved road
Type of cunt you never see them in the same clothes
Ten racks on the footy, what's the pain bro?

[Hook]
On the move, on the grind, it's the Kers one
Sippin' drink, gettin' high with a burnt blunt
They pray for my downfall, I just laugh but
I could have your chat bitch in a bath tub
I ain't one to have my eyes on a truck load
Kickin' back, gettin' sued as I puff 'dro
It's the Kers, I'm just livin' out my big dream
It all started in the South-West of Sydney

[Verse 2]
I sweat swag and I smell like a new note
I wrote this with a joint on a new boat
I'm so sick, it's to the point that I'm too dope
I came in the rap game as a new hope
A fresh cunt with a style that is all mine
Tat a king's name, mine's on my jaw line
A trendsetter with a vendetta then get a
Drug addict on the benz and you get better
I explain myself, my album documentaries
No matter what, I'ma never be a memory
Only when they lay me down in the cemetery
And, even then, my ghost will be your fuckin' enemy
It's the Kers, I just racked one up
The line was longer than the plate, I still racked it bruz
Then walk around fucked up, you won't see me 'til a week later
Kerser one, I'm your fuckin' girl's screen saver

[Hook]
On the move, on the grind, it's the Kers one
Sippin' drink, gettin' high with a burnt blunt
They pray for my downfall, I just laugh but
I could have your chat bitch in a bath tub
I ain't one to have my eyes on a truck load
Kickin' back, gettin' sued as I puff drogue
It's the Kers, I'm just livin' out my big dream
It all started in the South-West of Sydney
