[Intro]
Ch-yea
Kerser
Nuh nu-nuh

[Verse 1]
I need to piss and your mouth is my target
I'm deadset I dunno why you're laughing
I'm with your girl and she like to call me perfect
She offended cos her pussy smell like burned fish
I told the slut move along I'm a king bitch
Man she dreaming if she ever getting this dick
I offend a lot of people yeah I know that
That's half the reason why I fucking want the flow lads
Settle down slut shut your fucking mouth up
'Fore I get the scissors out and join your pussy with your butt huh
What the fucks up come and try censor me
You're about as relevant as fucking channel V
They say I take shots that can burn bridges
I been the same since 'Kerser is the Sickest'
Never gave a fuck and I speak for my fanbase
Putting ex pills in your grandmother's pancakes

[Hook]
They can't handle Kerser
They get scared my words are
Making their kids murder
Woah my laugh it burns ya
Take a sec to realise
You see me in real life
Keyboard heroes know this
They are scared to throw fists

[Verse 2]
Cruisin' with a fucking ride on lawnmower
At your front door with a fucking horn blower
Why they all talk then they can't say shit?
You as gay as a Triple J playlist
I'm-a drop C4 on the stairway
If they ever think of giving me some airplay
Rather have my dick stuck in an exhaust pipe
Than hear a bunch of faggots talking like some blonde dykes
I'm the Aussie rapper that be raising the bar
The proof is in the pudding check my place and my car
Skill is right in front of ya, aiming for ya jugular
Take your adam's apple out then I start to jungle bruh
I'm-a double up everything I make cuz
I'm at the point where I enjoy it at the bank bruz
And you can talk all your shit about ABK
But when you do it can you please make it face to face?

[Hook]
They can't handle Kerser
They get scared my words are
Making their kids murder
Woah my laugh it burns ya
Take a sec to realise
You see me in real life
Keyboard heroes know this
They are scared to throw fists

[Verse 3]
I'm-a break it down only way I know how
I'm on your roof yelling fucking are you home now?
Take your roof tiles out as I slide in
You were scared but your missus had a slight grin
I'm like man I be running the game
These other cunts ain't shit they just running my name
I got a gun and a blade I'm out the front of you place
I'm like come inside then they end up running away

[Hook]
They can't handle Kerser
They get scared my words are
Making their kids murder
Woah my laugh it burns ya
Take a sec to realise
You see me in real life
Keyboard heroes know this
They are scared to throw fists
