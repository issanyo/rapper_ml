Fantastic- Kerser

[Verse 1]
Started off run away from a cop car
Now they consider me a rock star
I mean rap star someone gotta gat brah
Kill another rapper then kill a racker
Red hot when I drop my stuff
Hit 16 coppas tryin to lock me up
They won’t leave me alon imma cruise the ocean
Used to be broke till I mixed my potion
I rap with the look the skill and all
Sometimes my brain wants to kill it all
I had a case meet the cops
No cops wanna watch what i do
How i move while I’m with my crew
Tell em when you got money you got shit to do
Said she wanna fuck I’d rather piss on you
I got my respect you check on that
You lucky us cunts even let you rap
My bars made a Russ you learn from us
Biting Nebulizer you nervous fuck
So imma lift this shit to another bar
And don’t pop ya Nebs best ill fuck ya scar
Ya face and ya neck and ya arms attached
Ya racing to get ya little army lab
Then gone get got red hot hit gun shot
Writing out truth and it only got one plot
Fuck off with the future essence
And it’s weird, cause we steal the presents
What am I? I’m a fucking king
You a queen then suck it in
Dress good always looking fresh
Sex looks for me, I don’t look for sex
I’m a god imma king I run this shit
You couldn’t rate me with a number bitch, King!

[Hook]
Always high off my gut almost half asleep
I ain't ever give a fuck come and ask for me
Puffing joints sipping lean eating xaney’s too
Fucking oink you a pig fuck you attitude
We still run this rap shit
My crew kill you that's it
Never feeling better than I’m feeling it’s fantastic
We still run this rap shit
My crew kill you that's it
Never feeling better than I’m feeling it’s fantastic
Imma star imma king imma type of god
In the spa with your bitch and she ride the cock
Puffing joints sipping lean eating xaney’s too
Fucking oink you a pig fuck your attitude

[Verse 2]
Had enough of the talk owe you all that
Send my boys take ya shit where ya score at
I ain't wanna be nothing like the rest
And I don’t chill with nothing but the best
It’s so simple ABK
Run hip hop now till I age away
And once i age away I'll make major pay
Off other new rappers cause I pave the way
My crew are raw, abuse the law, I’m using more
(Mad drugs today)
The future lord, I’m moving more, more unit store
(That’s fucking pay)
I set the path, I let you laugh, Came extra hard
(Now they love me)
I read my bars, now weapon scars, I’m esh and barred
(Now they love me)
Turn a hater to a fan in a matter of seconds
Turn a hater to a hoe with a couple of weapons
Imma beast bow down yo praise the king
Back and forth yo graze your knee
Ain't no one done what me and Nebs did
Fans prove that cause they collect it
Always street kicking in the mansion
I’m posting pics of your bitch like Hanson, King!

[Hook]
Always high off my gut almost half asleep
I ain't ever give a fuck come and ask for me
Puffing joints sipping lean eating xaney’s too
Fucking oink you a pig fuck you attitude
We still run this rap shit
My crew kill you that's it
Never feeling better than I’m feeling it’s fantastic
We still run this rap shit
My crew kill you that's it
Never feeling better than I’m feeling it’s fantastic
Imma star imma king imma type of god
In the spa with your bitch and she ride the cock
Puffing joints sipping lean eating xaney’s too
Fucking oink you a pig fuck your attitude
