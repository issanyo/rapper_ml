(Kerser)
Back up on my shit
Bitch I never fucking left
Now they say I'm up for death
Aim for head or hit the chest
Now listen if they find me
Dead i guarantee they do clone
See me rest in peace
With the sickest on my tombstone

(Jay dee)
I'm also killing shit these days
When it comes to rap
I'm loving that so many
People seem to pump my tracks
I'm travelling through oz
Bringing out the truest sound
It's true without a doubt
To keep on at it with that music proud

(Kerser)
Cruise around C-town
I got the window down
I'm making sure they see me
So they know me I got it figured out
We rock a show now your girl got her pants wet
She in the front hands up screaming DEADSET!

(Jay dee)
You never met no other rappers doing shit like us
I'm loving that I got the chance to spit and rip this up
Spitin' bout some fricken cunts who love to light the billy's up
I'm finding crap to write new rap while livin' chillin' sitting drunk

(Kerser)
Sickest cunt like I need to fucking say it more
Said it every song 'til they cry what? ain't it raw?

(Jay dee)
This is a major flaw other rappers hating more
Acting crazy why the hating just cuz I said rape a whore

(Kerser)

Then them all put together I would play it but you bore us

(Jay dee)
You fucking oath they do
People fucking know it's true
We tour 'round the country
Go on tell us about the shows use do?

(Kerser)
If only you can pack out shows
I guess you'd own it too
I'm racking off the sub
Before I hit the stage you know me dude

(Jay dee)
You'd rather fuck the haters yeah we do it for our fan
And mates we land in states to burn the place
With 225 and chant the name

(Kerser)
I got my seat back
Rolling through the gold coast
Jaydee riding shotgun keep him busy as he rolls notes

(Jay dee)
I sit and light a smoke
Turn and then I find a note
Grab the pipe light it up
I can't believe you're driving bro

(Kerser)
Fuck I don't know
I'm just seeing what the night brings
A couple lines a couple joints
A few more other nice things
I might swim back to Sydney
'Til the tides in
Wait I'm slipping off the track
Just bring them fucking lines here

(Jay dee)
UF never ever found a day where we begin to fade
We stayed around
Pen and pages down till we reach our fate
If we say we told you so
It's because we told you so
Don't you fuckin' act like we did not
When I just told you so

(Kerser)
You older blokes pissed off
Cos I accomplished more
You only seen with me if
You come around to fucking mop my floor

(Jay dee)
So stop the talk you know we made it
Yes we know you fuckin' hate it

(Kerser)
Let me cut you off right there
And tell these cunts that I'm the GREATEST!

(Jay dee)
And I'm the messiest and report the heavy shit
But every bit of effort spent of land me standing
Wrecking this

(Kerser)

We're hennessy your harsh goon
You go and spit your shit til you choke

(Kerser)
You cunts are just prostey clowns
Like hanging up in bathrooms
My pen to paper magic illustrated
Like a cartoon

(Jay dee)
We shinning like a star dude
Funny cuz I'm looking down
My energy will hit the ground
Then bounce right up and hook your mouth

(Kerser)
I couldn't drown with a block on my foot
I'm that warm good feeling like a cock in a moot?
Wait.....

(Jay dee)
Jaydee the upper commer staying true
This ain't a phase disc
My names due to now get recognized
Just call that paid jews
The mic and me belong never will just tear apart
Same goes with my crew that's why I got it branded on my arm
Never meant not any harm to anything or anyone
All I do is pour the truth and make sure that I air my heart

(Kerser)

Its Kers one the one cunt that makes skinny look good
So when you see me in your town drunk come and give a pound up
