I use to play 2Pac when I blazed up weed
Shit changed that year when I laced a beat
I'm that south west kid, Just the same as the others
I think that's why the relate cos I came from the slums
Now maybe man I don't know I'm just doing what I love cus
Rappers that like bitch stab your back when you get funds up
Strap the Nike's up
Strap the Nike's up
At school I stayed stoned
Trying to keep my eyelids wide and up
Now I'm on stage and can not get the fucking shut
Use to ride my bike to the dealers so they hit me up
Shit changed, Menchanged my name, amungsted kings
