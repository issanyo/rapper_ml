[Verse 1]
I found the note you left, I think that it’s a weak way
To say your feelings, you were lying to me each day
You even told me you would stick no matter what went
But I took you for granted, now I lost it
I keep my head up, I’ma show you what you’re missin’ girl
I’ma make you wanna go and find a different world
The jealous type but I don’t care if we ain’t nothin’ right
I’ma flip if you in photos with another guy
You a snake and I got wounded with the venom, no
All my groupie tellin’ me I gotta let it go
But it ain’t easy when I’ve wasted years of my life
You said you need me, now you play it as a white lie
Why I try with the effort and all that
When you ain’t send a lazy message or call back
I fall flat ‘cause I’m sittin’ alone
And I want revenge ‘cause you told me that it won’t end

[Hook]
So you did leave? You couldn’t help me?
So long, you’re gone, I couldn’t tell the
Other half of my brain that it won’t work
Try to hide I’m in pain, but I’m so hurt
So you did leave? You couldn’t help me?
So long, you’re gone, I couldn’t tell the
Other half of my brain that it won’t work
Try to hide I’m in pain, but I’m so hurt

[Verse 2]
Stressed out, I ain’t hidin’ the fact
It took a bottle of the black to be writin’ this rap
So I lightin’ the lads, like “I ain’t carin’ no more”
You took it all and I fall as I wait for the call
Now I could call you up but I ain’t gonna do that
I’m missing, need you here, yeah, I’m sayin’ I need you back
True fact, the morning you left
Had me feelin’ like I lost a soul or mournin’ a death
Now all that is left got me surrounded by sluts
‘Cause it’s nothin’ without you, name the housin’ wouldn’t touch it
So I’m sleepin’ on the lounge at my mate’s place
I can take you back, I’m sure that we can go and make space
Don’t say late ‘cause I haven’t slept in eight days
When I close my eyes, I can only see my babe’s face
Start chokin’ yep, I’m heartbroken
I’d pay to see your smile, hear your laugh I’m hopin’

[Hook]
So you did leave? You couldn’t help me?
So long, you’re gone, I couldn’t tell the

So you did leave? You couldn’t help me?
So long, you’re gone, I couldn’t tell the
Other half of my brain that it won’t work

[Bridge]
I’m blamin’ you for what I’m goin’ through and only you
Would know the reason why I’m sittin’ here with only two
Dollars to my name, here we go again
Starin’ at an empty bottle, barely stay insane
I’m blamin’ you for what I’m goin’ through and only you
Would know the reason why I’m sittin’ here with only two
Dollars to my name, here we go again
Starin’ at an empty bottle, barely stay insane
