[Hook: Sample & Kerser]
Hello, we on another level (what-what you smoking?)
Smokin' hydro
You know me man, I smoke that good weed and
Go and get a feed, come back and smoke weed again

[Verse 1: Kerser]
Choppin' up weed, I'm in the mood
My eyes stay closed, can barely move
Scissors, bowl, lighter, weed
All I need on a night like these
Morning man, same thing
All of them claymen
All of them waiting
Quarter, yep, blazing
Sit around, got a bud that's fat
Suckin' on a billy 'til my lungs collapse
Got up at ten, went to bed at six
Got up again, gotta get a stick
See to me twenty bucks, that's a gram
Chopped up, eyes red, smashed again
Hydro sticky orange hairs
I love my weed, man I'm choppin' plants
Stop it man, I got this easy
Never see me without my CP
Weed be the food that feed me
Feeds my things the things ain't eating
More shit, light the bong
Good for my brain, I might be wrong
Right, it's on, I picked a win
I'll hit you clean, no mix with spin

[Verse 2: Kerser]
I met you when I was twelve
"Here, try this." Might as well
Thanks Rates, he introduced us
Ever since then, I need to use this
Never fight you by my side
I'll light tonight, it's fine all right
When I'm on other drugs, I think of you
Can't go one day without missin' you
See me and you and you and me
Who's to see what you do to me
I kick or scream when you're out of reach
Stay home, smoke cones like I'm bound to be
Smokin' and I'm never stoppin'
Stoppin'? Nah, can't be bothered
Choppin' up, my lungs be rottin'
Coughin', keep on choppin' choppin'
Stress free, yeah I'll be
I think of you, do you think of me?
You're good in cookies, good in paper
Good in bongs, I could never hate ya
I need you now, I'm glad I have ya
Please try to get along with my asthma
Either way, you're here to stay
I'll light you up 'til I pass away

[Bridge: Sample]
Look in my eyes, I get so high every night
Every day of my life
Look in my eyes, I get so high every night
Every day of my life
