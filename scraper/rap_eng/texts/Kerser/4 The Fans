[Verse 1:]
I can save your life; shit won’t even take no time
Walked through hell to get here, now I’m meant to fucking make it rhyme
I had the ground pulled from under me so come with me
Said I was the sickest, somehow still I kept humble, geez!
I seen what you seen, maybe seen a little more
I been there hungry, empty stomach, living fucking poor
I’ve seen them fights on the street, domestic shit too
One stage was crazy the whole hood was dacking shivs, truth
I've seen them guns drawn for fun, add a DS
That's fun chasing funds, they was street fresh
Now they in a cell, I watched it fall apart
Talk to Sero's mum, it hurts to hear her when she pours her heart
Plus my own mum, she ain't wanna hear my shit
She's best to block it out if I was her I'd break to bits
What to do? I'm just trying to save my fans now
So it's fuck the world, drinking liquor with my pants down

[Hook:]
This for you, now you, you the fans now
This for all the fans who feeling like they need a new route
You can do it if I did it, find a better place
You can turn your future, wiping out your yesterdays
This for her, this for him, this for your life
I'm paying back my fans, so I'm a gonna give 'em more rhymes
No matter what they say...fuck impossible
Make it possible, remove the IM, that's the obstacle

[Verse 2:]
When I heard nightmare I didn't sleep for nights; swear
Me and Rates the same so put us in a psych, yeah
Is that the answer? Is it? Lock down the whole crew?
Half in prison, half in rehab, half in doll ques
I guess I fluked it then, why I sitting at the top?
You decide, 'cause these cunts won't ever bring me props
Jealousy will probably overrule the whole world
I'm with my fans, we just chilling in our own world
I've got my crew too, the ones that made it through the struggle
Mind you, those who didn't make it, I'm still here just know I love you
I should be idolised, I'm proof that the gutter grows
If you do it properly, turn that gutter to a fucking rose
I don't fucking know, I'm eating Xanny tabs
'Cause anxiety has got me feeling like I have attacks
But you don't care for me, I know where to play my part
I won't get lost, I've did it, proven that I'm way too smart

[Hook:]
This for you, now you, you the fans now
This for all the fans who feeling like they need a new route
You can do it if I did it, find a better place
You can turn your future, wiping out your yesterdays
This for her, this for him, this for your life
I'm paying back my fans, so I'm a gonna give 'em more rhymes
No matter what they say...fuck impossible
Make it possible, remove the IM, that's the obstacle

[Verse 3:]
And I still spin out. Is this a dream or something?
Nebs my brother and I thank him 'cause he's seen something
When they was doubting me, Nebs was like fuck that
He's like "We got this, man. I see we gonna run rap"
And look what fucking happened. I thank you mad fam
I thank Sarm for giving patience, shout outs to That's Them
And my best mate Boobz I owe my life to
If I never met him never would have picked up mics, phew!
That was high school, and they were high still
He said I'm the best in Oz, and he's right still
Shouts to Rates one; fuck, he knew this day would come
And his day is coming from the streets I guess we fucking won
Shouts to Jay Dee, he on top of shit
His music hitting hard, I can't see 'em stopping him
Oh yeah, and April forget them broke days
I told you that I love you, plus I made 'em go away

[Hook:]
This for you, now you, you the fans now
This for all the fans who feeling like they need a new route
You can do it if I did it, find a better place
You can turn your future, wiping out your yesterdays
This for her, this for him, this for your life
I'm paying back my fans, so I'm a gonna give 'em more rhymes
No matter what they say...fuck impossible
Make it possible, remove the IM, that's the obstacle
