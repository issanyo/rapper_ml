[Verse 1: Fortay]
Come smoke with me number four
Blowing them trees like a thunderstorm
Got Os, got Ps, got 'em fucking all
You know where I be want buds just call
Deliver to your door in about an hour
Fort's selling more plants than Flower Power
If I run late while I'm dropping those
Get the fuck out my face, I ain't Dominos
Different strains hit the brain put the tip to flame
Blowing that shit get clear the game
Never choked like a bitch with her throat on dick
Smoking cones, no spin 'cause that shit be leek
Cunts know from a sniff once I zip the bag
Smoking that shit you wish you had
Wouldn't touch a toke of the crud you smoke
Wouldn't get me high, just get me mad
Getting more drugs than a quarter mile
Shit smells like chron you call tell I'm on
Can't sell drugs 4 eva
Might be true but you can sell the bong
Hit, hit, hit, no pass the shit
If you broke and want a cone, go ask the tick
Chopping up with an O or half a stick
Lighting weed, let an ice fiend blow a glass dick

[Verse 2: Kerser]
Kers on the mic, yeah, I'm high as fuck
True, who said part four? I thought part two
Never mind, I'm smashed as shit
Chopping up bud with an axe legit
With my hands slip and it hits some prick
And it left him split, I just sparked a spliff, huh
Didn't mean that's an accident
Did you get that shit? That's an axe and dent
In the side of your head, get me rhyming again
Every time you see me, my eyes are red
Hitting them trees AM to PM
They say Kers should run for PM
Okay, let's get back to dabs
Paranoid 'cause the cops throw taxi cabs
I don't know, I'm hitting cones like back to back
Can you help? I'm flipping out like an acrobat
Scott's an A, what's a strain?
Call it what you want, I call it off your face
Rocking up with that bud, bud
Sipping off that mud, mud
Fuck the lame flow, I know you don't want trouble son
Chopping up weed and I chew it with my bubblegum
There's another one, shit I'm kind of fucked up
Sparking up weed with your bitch in a spa bath

[Verse 3: Redbak]
(Have another cone cunt) Fuck yeah, why not?
It's four-twenty on my watch
And pass the eyedrops, cause this hydro got
Them beaming red, looking like Cyclops
Love the ganja, but I'm no rasta
Five AM, eating pasta
Can't break out of the spell I'm under
When I do I go pack another
Take a hit, that's the shit
Too much spin, that's sacrilege
I'm at your crib, I'll attack your fridge
Looking mad ripped but I'm not at the gym
We punch cones that'll punch you back
I was flat on the floor like "What the fuck was that?"
And I'm pretty sure that my right lungs collapsed
If mum finds my stash, I'll have a heart attack
I'm so high bro, off the hydro
That my iPhone is on flight mode
If I have none, I turn psycho
Grab a knife and go
'Cause blazing the weed is a daily routine
Every day of the week, understand what I mean
Not from a lab Mary Jane came from a seed
Seed she's so fresh and so green (green)

[Verse 4: Jay UF]
Come smoke with me, you know it's me
Well now I call two when bring over weed
The JD with coke when I'm smoking up
You know that I've grown up with my own little buzz but
Never change when I'm on this mic
Teenage in and out I've enjoyed my high
I know that I say I'll quit but yeah not tonight
So quick thumb screw that shit nice and tight
After that paranoia sets in
Holding my heart like it's caving my chest in
It's messing with my head, never learn lessons
The question is will I ever quit seshing?
Nah, simple answer to that
Couldn't care if cannabis plans to react with Xanax
I'm prepared in my chair and relaxed
So I couldn't give a damn about a panic attack
Let me hit my spliff tonight
Watch conspiracy theories all night
Fuck TV, I'm on the YouTube
And if you smoke too then you probably do to
Shit, this weed man, it's fucking my head dude
Hiding from aliens up in my bedroom
Sure I love weed, yeah I'll never regret you
But I hate the voices "we're coming to get you!"
