[Hook]
I had it all
And then I look in your eyes and I watch it all
Crash over, again
And oh
I take a look at the tears that I shed and now I know
I'll never change again (uh)

[Verse 1: Kerser]
Rolled a blunt, now I'm starin' at the thick smoke
Say I didn't work hard, is that a sick joke?
I've lost everything from rap but never quit though
The hardest working rapper ask Jay or my big bro
You think this shit just fuckin' fell in my lap?
Too many sleepless nights had me bring hell into rap
I will never be the same, guess they right, yeah, I changed
But everything is strange in this fuckin' rap game
Rappers pissed off 'cause they can't get a pay cheque
They need to blame someone, so I'm gettin' the blame yep'
Reporter's on my back yeah they waitin' on a slip up
Live TV still came off like a sick cunt
Nothing on a mic that I struggle to do
My fans are watching me grow up so they lovin' me too
Man it's been a crazy ride, my life is like a fuckin' movie bro
I'm still poppin' with Nebs in the studio, shit

[Hook]
I had it all
And then I look in your eyes and I watch it all
Crash over, again
And oh
I take a look at the tears that I shed and now I know
I'll never change again

[Verse 2: Kerser]
Try a listenin' session, I bet you're kicking your head in
'Cause you just realised I'm the best at it, the shit that you spreadin'
The stress free day ain't a part of my life
But if the stress ever stop then it's harder to write
So it's a lose win scenario, make life a party bro
Every single day, it's like my life is gettin' harder though
And the music with the stress, yeah, it brings plenty
I know a lot for a person in their mid twenties
I met a cunt who had a shiv in his dacks
A flash-back, thank fuck I ain't living like that
Don't consider me a preacher i'm just giving you the real world
The hardest thing you have to do in life is find a real girl
Speak the truth, loyal mates are a handful
Fake friends are only there when you got your hands full
If people talking and they giving you hate
Make sure you make your dream true and rub your shit in their face
It's what I done

[Hook]
I had it all
And then I look in your eyes and I watch it all
Crash over, again
And oh
I take a look at the tears that I shed and now I know
I'll never change again

[Verse 3: Kerser]
Never gonna stop with the shit that I do
I seen one to many fake friends dissin' me too
Shit you haven't seen, I'm busy, yeah, I barely get a day off
You got my back all night its like I'm trying till my day stop
I ain't chase props I get it when I spray plots
On how to run this hip-hop till my motherfuckin' grave spot
It's filled up with beers and purple sprite bottles
Now who the fuck said Kerser is a role-model?
All day, I hear these rumours fly
But when you're at the top they try make your movement die
Even rappers actin' nice saying my raps are phat
And the jealousy hits I got 'em stabbin' my back
But it's part of the game, got no heart, you are lame
Sometimes I wanna rewind and just start it again
I'm at the top and it's burning 'em, brah
Hall of fame motherfucker, yeah, Kerser's a star!
We out

[Hook:]
I had it all
And then I look in your eyes and I watch it all, crash over, again
And oh
I take a look at the tears that I shed and now I know
I'll never change again
