[Hook: John Andrews]
Stuck inside myself again
Covered up in the bruises from my youth
And I don’t wanna face the fact
That I’m off track and won’t make it back
Say it’s never safe to crash
But don’t be sad when it fades to black

[Verse 1: Kerser]
I don’t want to face the facts, I’m moving forward racing back
To pick up what was facing back, and turn it round to make the cash
They say I influence the kids in ways that I can’t understand
I’m meant to be a role model, that’s one thing I can’t comprehend
You mean to tell me where I’m from, that they thought I would make it man
The industry can’t take me, I can tell the way they shake my hand
But they don’t know my story, how I meant to paint a picture?
When it’s written with my pen and that to them is just a distant hem
We came up from the bottom and the bottom of my bottles empty
Wonder if we gotem ain’t no stoppin cause the top is scary
They start acting different and my brain is in a crazy place
But in the spotlight they tell you to hide it, it’s amazing aye?
That someone’s finally speakin out, it happens to be Kerser too
Everything I’m going through, I put em in my words to you
Good or bad or right or wrong? If I think it, I write a song
To scared for mental checkups cause they tell me that my mind is gone

Stuck inside myself again

And I don’t wanna face the fact
That I’m off track and won’t make it back

But don’t be sad when it fades to black

[Verse 2: Kerser]
Waking up a zombie you’re to kind to blame it on me
Ain’t my fault that I am not be one to turn it down, get off me
I don’t need a bunch of parents blaming me cos their kids are swearing
Like they never hear the shit at school but blaming me’s the answer
I’m the cancer if you asking, but wait let’s stop and just ask the kids
Cause I be saving lives and they decide to look right past all this
Hundred emails weekly, here’s one that will never leave me
Single mother writes to management it’s desperate that she meets me
Cause the son he had a habit from when he was age of 14
In and out of rehab but my music’s only thing that taught him
That there’s other ways around it, so he left the rehab clean and all
Kerser through the earphones, got a job, he even sweepin floors
One night he is out with mates he copped a sucker punch and died and she just wants to thank me cause I gave him 4 more years of life
Crazy cause I’m messed up in my own head, yeah you so surprised
Poppin what I can cause I can’t handle this, I’m going [?]

[Verse 3: Kerser]
Ok I make a U-turn yeah, it’s time to pull my head in
And hope to jump in bead and get earphones and just forget it
Forget about the drama, life’s to short just fix it upper
When you get home, you know nudda
You can handle this your brothers
Wait along onside a road and I ain’t got my lights on neither
Need my window wipers on cause I can barely see the mirror
Almost home I guess this place is really where I get away
But before I leave I just got one more thing I wanna say

[Hook: John Andrews]
