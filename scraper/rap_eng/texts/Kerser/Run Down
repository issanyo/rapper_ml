[Verse 1]
This game is cut throat, lame as fuck though
Say they got your back, but they hatin', uh oh
Why we even shocked man?
Soon as I made it the face say god damn
They were spewin' and I knew it
What you doin'? Did you do it?
Why they copyin' my moves bro?
And this and that the same time, whats the rules yo
[?] Nah shit that's the cold game, relevant Kers never be a old name
And all the little bitches wanna come and suck your dick, it's like you never did exist shit
What's the difference, bitches sendin' pictures, bitches start bitchin' over bitches, did I hit this?
So I roll on fuck [?] platform, why you think half these rappers even have floor
They can have more, do what the Kers done, if i'm giving you advice then its word up
Listen up hear the way you got to do things, only roll with the crew you came through with
Ignore haters, get to the big biz, buy a house, get property, but with this, comes fake friends or even you closest, hate your doing while they turn before you notice

[Hook]
I'm giving you the run down
Tell you what the life like
Case you're thinking that you ever grabbing my mic
It's night night, on the flight flight, why's my back sore? 'Cause they stabbin' with the knife like
Never meant what they said, they hate you bro
Hate your new house, jewels, and your new car
They pretend cause' they wanna be friends
This the life I can't explain 'til I want it to end, yeah

[Verse 2]
[?] getting into drugs man this shit is a trap
Hold you back 'til you snap, and you struggle to rap
Or even struggle to write words, hit with a tight verse
If they racking up, make sure you watch them try first
Plus rappers are snakes, they don't like you
Don't let them in your ear they just hype you
When people turn, man they goin' wipe you
If i could go back they wouldn't be on my tune
And my moves were made out of nothing
I'd be down with the street had it pumpin
But that there brings trouble in it's own right, lucky i got moves that would shoot never know right
Plus i keep my blade tucked, cause' i'm paranoid, I ain't getting jumped by ten cunts I'm [?] boy
Media and websites shat on my name, cause' i was reppin a gang, and I just couldn't be tamed
They had me on the TV defending rap
And fuck Aussie rap, they won't defend you back
If you're taking advice, then take it from me
The Kerser same cunt that was selling tapes on the street
Never kissed ass, never sucked up to labels
Never bowed down, never fuck you I'm able to stand at the top and look what I fought through
Kers made it yeah, who would've thought true

[Hook]
I'm giving you the run down
Tell you what the life like
Case you're thinking that you ever grabbing my mic
It's night night, on the flight flight, why's my back sore? 'Cause they stabbin' with the knife like
Never meant what they said, they hate you bro
Hate your new house, jewels, and your new car
They pretend cause' they wanna be friends
This the life I can't explain 'til I want it to end, yeah
I'm giving you the run down
Tell you what the life like
Case you're thinking that you ever grabbing my mic
It's night night, on the flight flight, why's my back sore? 'Cause they stabbin' with the knife like
Never meant what they said, they hate you bro
Hate your new house, jewels, and your new car
They pretend cause' they wanna be friends
This the life I can't explain 'til I want it to end, yeah

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm giving you the run down
What it takes to actually live this life
Gonna come across some fake friends
But to think it was all fun and games

[Hook]
I'm giving you the run down
Tell you what the life like
Case you're thinking that you ever grabbing my mic
It's night night, on the flight flight, why's my back sore? 'Cause they stabbin' with the knife like

Hate your new house, jewels, and your new car
They pretend cause' they wanna be friends
This the life I can't explain 'til I want it to end, yeah
