[Hook: Rachel Pearl]
I love you, I want you, I need you oh
I'm high when I touch you don't leave me no
Without you it's lonely and freezing cold
Everybody tells me to leave you alone
It's a catastrophe, you're so bad for me
You have to leave, but come back to me
It's a catastrophe, you're so bad for me
You have to leave, you have to leave

[Verse 1: Kerser]
I try my best I needed you
You were standing there like I need you too
We're so lost and I'm stressin' out
You need me there but the next of towns is
Where I'm at cos I can't get my head round
The last look you gave me before you put your head down
Your friends say I'm bad for you
Tell them mind your own business haven't you
Picked up that I'm lost and I'm freakin' out
Cos my life so crazy me without
You is like something I cannot picture
Speakin' of picture think I just ripped the
Last one on the wall of us two
Doesn't change the fact that I love you
I'm a mess and I can't decide
Then I pick the phone up and I hear you like..

[Hook: Rachel Pearl]
I love you, I want you, I need you oh
I'm high when I touch you don't leave me no
Without you it's lonely and freezing cold
Everybody tells me to leave you alone
It's a catastrophe, you're so bad for me
You have to leave, but come back to me
It's a catastrophe, you're so bad for me
You have to leave, you have to leave

[Verse 2: Kerser]
You scream at me, I'm screamin back
That I'm seeing black right as I snap shit
Why you leave then come back so quick?
What you need is here and you know this
Other night you swung a punch
At me and it hit and I had to laugh ha
Why you mad? What I do? What a heartbreak
Holdin on your chest like your heartache
You don't know what to do with your life now
What's next? Are we gonna turn the lights out?
Say yes, then you're hard to find
You've been there like half my life
It's okay, I guess you're right
But you ain't gonna leave for the rest of the night
This the end then I'm asking for one more
Night with you then you're at the front door like..

[Hook: Rachel Pearl]
I love you, I want you, I need you oh
I'm high when I touch you don't leave me no
Without you it's lonely and freezing cold
Everybody tells me to leave you alone
It's a catastrophe, you're so bad for me
You have to leave, but come back to me
It's a catastrophe, you're so bad for me
You have to leave, you have to leave

[Verse 3: Kerser]
Stuck in a maze going back and forth
Then you hear me wiff why you rappin' for?
What you expect, that I leave it all?
Do I have to remind you It feeds us all?
Tearing us apart don't make me choose
I know you too well, you hate to lose
Every time I call you're by my side
You try ring me like 99
Times and I don't pick up and its crazy
Dunno what to do just lost it maybe
Find a way to make this work
Say you love Scott but you hate the Kers
What to do? Don't know just air thoughts
If I leave then I'm headin' to the airport
Overseas and I bet you hate
Gettin' on the plane and you're at the gate like..

[Hook: Rachel Pearl]
I love you, I want you, I need you oh
I'm high when I touch you don't leave me no
Without you it's lonely and freezing cold
Everybody tells me to leave you alone
It's a catastrophe, you're so bad for me
You have to leave, but come back to me
It's a catastrophe, you're so bad for me
You have to leave, you have to leave
