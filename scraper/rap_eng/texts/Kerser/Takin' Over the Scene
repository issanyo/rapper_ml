[Intro: Kerser & Jay UF]
This one is to all of those other rappers
Who like to diss us but hide when we find them
You're not rappers, you're faggots
What happening Jay-Dee? Fuck all again, mate
Kerser and Jay UF
All right, now fucking listen

[Verse 1: Kerser]
Fuck these rappers man they homos and gays
I may as well quit rapping and work on Home and Away
I mean, why the fuck you cunts biting my shit?
And why these pussy fuckin' rappers always higher than this?
And don't think I forgot about that Tracy Grimshaw
Who's got the shits at life because her tits and dick's small
And listen, if you listen to Allday
There's not one exception, you fuckers are all gay
And people ask me when you gonna diss 6
My reply I don't wanna hurt a big bitch
Its Kers one you know Sydney is my home mark
All these rappers drop nuts like 60 in a go-kart
You hearing rumours and they probably true
If they include me being a fuckin' problem to you
And my dick's so big that they think I got three legs
Hardest choice in life is who I make bleed next

[Hook: Kerser]
We told these cunts that they are wack
And we will take over the scene
And now they hate and sook
And act like they don't even notice
We are at the top it hurts their pride
We laugh, they hide and try to diss
But, when we find 'em, they cry
So tell me, why do they do this shit?

[Verse 2: Jay UF]
Let me hit my spliff tonight
(Jay you've said that two times) I'm shit all right
I still write all the time, can't be fucked to work
I'm still a joke, I'm still a bum, but find that life could be worse
I mean I record for free, I score for free
I have a lot of goals in life, I hope they all for free
But talk on beats, I'm awful, I want more for free
So, if you got some free shit, send it all to me
I'm like the mate you got, the free tracks are for sesh
Promise shit I can't keep that's why I'm stuck in the debt
I ain't a normal bloke, no, I'm just fucked in the head
The type to be nice to your nan and get under her dress
I just say some shit to fucking stir up the pot
Like hit a diss to fuckin' Kers while I spit it with Scott
So everybody, give it up when I'm up in your hood
It's Jay-Dee, the one cunt who makes chubby look good
What?

[Hook: Kerser]
We told these cunts that they are wack
And we will take over the scene
And now they hate and sook
And act like they don't even notice
We are at the top it hurts their pride
We laugh, they hide and try to diss
But, when we find 'em, they cry
So tell me, why do they do this shit?

[Verse 3: Kerser & Jay]
You fucken chad pussies got smelly vaginas
And they pissing off Jay like the end of reminders
Fuck don't bring that up bro, I got in shit
Plus it wasn't my fault, it was they drugs that I did
We were cutting it sick and we took over the scene
Plus not at one second were we sober or clean
Now I'm over the beam, but I'm puffing a joint man
Okay, you got a point Jay, but you had a point then
Fuck off cunt I had five points that day
Crystal in my pocket like Matt thought he had aye
Wait, did I just do a diss? Subliminal shit?
I think I just did, fuck it bro, we pissed in his beer
Shit yeah, we did, we might get banned from the festival
Let's scrap this whole track bro this wasn't professional
Fuck that shit, Kers, we ain't here to make friends
We're here to do what we started and we're here till the end

[Hook: Kerser]
We told these cunts that they are wack
And we will take over the scene
And now they hate and sook
And act like they don't even notice
We are at the top it hurts their pride
We laugh, they hide and try to diss
But, when we find 'em, they cry
So tell me, why do they do this shit?
