[Verse 1]
They whack, they just copying Kers
With a sloppier verse, I hit the top with earth
Then I drop you it hurts, fuck you playing for cunt?
I'll leave you all tied up, laid out in my trunk
Straight out you a punk pussy bitch with a whack flow
Couldn't offer ten fuckin' mills for collab no!
Wouldn't do it 'cause your raps make my ears bleed
You should call your album Nobody Should Hear Me
Warn the public what you're giving to them
I;d rather listen to me take a fuckin' shit in a can
You're fuckin' kidding me man, just give up with the rap
All my fans call me king and I live up to that
I get a fuckin' A+ if the rap was a test
Dissing the Kers, well that's an appen offence
Then you found somewhere tied up to a tree
As I hit my fuckin' horn drive off lighten weed
I'm like

[Hook]
They should just quit (they should just quit)
It makes me sick (it makes me sick)
They on the dick (they on the dick)
Then try to diss (then try to diss)
How does this work? (how does this work?)
I must be first (I must be first)
If you hate Kers (if you hate Kers)
You're a fucking nerd (you're a nerd)

[Verse 2]
Don't really care about no ARIA
When I get up for my speech I'ma laugh at ya
I swear to god I'ma yell out ABK for life
And if one person boos, man they're losing they life
I gotta move it all right, I'm fucking chasing a dream
Came a long way, used to chase for a beam
Don't you say that I'm mean though, I couldn't give a rat's are
Cunts talk shit, yeah, only when they smash glass
Fucker fiends, they get jealous of Kers
Look how far a cunt come, I come up from the dirt
You run up, you get hurt, you, him, him and her
I ain't prejudice bitch
Cop a beatin' from Kers! Damn
First slams like a beat in your sub does
Charging people money if they wanna touch us
I don't know, did my ego grow man
Bill my doctor for a time at the program

[Hook]
They should just quit (they should just quit)
It makes me sick (it makes me sick)
They on the dick (they on the dick)
Then try to diss (then try to diss)
How does this work? (how does this work?)
I must be first (I must be first)
If you hate Kers (if you hate Kers)
You're a fucking nerd (you're a nerd)

[Verse 3]
Off my guts on a regular basis
Popping pills cause I look like a face lift has just occured
Now they think I'm using Botox I said "it's just the Kers"
She offered me a blow job, what the fuck with the sluts today?
I'm here, there, atm but she passed away
Half way through like "what the fuck should I do?"
Left her laying there dead as I done up my shoes
I'm a nice guy right, I don't need your approval
Sent the nudes around on the same day as the funeral
I'm beautiful, fuck what a cunt think
I take drugs cause it helps me to unthink
About the fucking future with strays he's strapped
He'll shoot ya
ABK 225 that's the crew brah
Got the whole rap game held in a manoeuvre

[Hook]
They should just quit (they should just quit)
It makes me sick (it makes me sick)
They on the dick (they on the dick)
Then try to diss (then try to diss)
How does this work? (how does this work?)
I must be first (I must be first)
If you hate Kers (if you hate Kers)
You're a fucking nerd (you're a nerd)
