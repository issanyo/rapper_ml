[Verse 1: Kerser]
In the club new clothes that I wear once
After this guaranteed that their teared up
With a bloodstain high from the monday
All the way till monday
Reload on sunday
With the shades on to hide my eyes
I write rap mother fucker
Its my 9-5
And my 5-9 is like lines and lines
Until my mind is like your gonna die tonight
Get my car and I key shove it in my ear
Dig a bit coke thats been there for like a year
And i snort that shit
While your bad bitch hits her knees
On the spot and gets my ball-bag licked
Its the name of the game with the fame its insane
Defined on the beat so its crazy again
See me in the club in the V.I.P with fortay sydney till I d-i-e

[Hook: Kerser]
Whatcha gonna do you gon ride to this
Light spliffs, might just jump up till ya mind is
Fucked up ain't a worry inside
Everybody out for some trouble tonight
Whatcha gonna do you gon ride to this
Light spliffs, might just jump up till ya mind is
Fucked up ain't a worry inside
Everybody out for some trouble tonight

[Verse 2: Fortay]
All night club packed and I'm fucked up
I can't trunk so I untuck bout to run a muck
Tough luck dont talk but just suck
Pump loads in a slut like a dump truck
If sex is a race till the cunt squirts
I can be behind you and still cum first
Chill its just words pill and a blunt burnt
And i be feeling like (???)
Suck me off bitch
Dexy's next and im bending them necks
We got our ABC's but remember the f's
Straight in no lube only saying to sluts
Cuz there ain't no games no playing with cunts
In the club so I ain't real? what the fuck?
Just came to slang pills and cop a suck
No happy hardcore cunt none of that dance shit
Before you diss me fuck your mum in advance bitch

Get fucked up, get drunk, get popped up
Get fucked cunt, just suck you dumb fuck
Gotta make more than the day before
Breaking the law is what the fuck you came here for
Get fucked up, get drunk, get popped up
Get fucked cunt, get punched you dumb fucks
Kerser and fortay thought you get it
When the shit goes down, whatcha gonna do?

[Hook: Kerser]

Sounds so new cause its never been done
And we're two of sydneys best who's better than us?
No cunt, hoes hang from the end of my nuts
Your bitch will be lucky if im letting her suck
I want the answers here, I want the dancers here
I want her on her knees before I stamp her ear
And ill drag her through the crowd like what the fuck
And you stop, you look like drop the mutt
More cock for ya slut, put a cock in a cunt
Sex shops couldn't be more cocky than us
So I leave that there for the crew to have
Dont lie you slut you're use to that
Few jabs in the ring no titled fight
High as a kite hoes like a bro
And I meet em from the streets
But its nothing to talk about
You cunts bout as tough as a muff in a whore house
