[Verse 1: Kerser]
Sparked spliff in the back of a spaceship
I'm used to it, I'm a star, this is greatness
Let me ride, what you gonna say? You hate this?
Then you see me in real life and don't say shit
Enough of basic, let me hit 'em where it hurts
Shiv 'em with the verse and Kers will sink 'em make their liver burst
I deliver words crazy 'til they're in a hearse
Still alive they didn't die but I prefer to injure first
Then hit 'em with the headshot
I wanna see the legs drop
My rapping is a weapon it's like acid in your head and it
Attacks you in a second know what happened do you reckon
I'm the king of the game now, fuck your opinion
It doesn't count 'cause you're losin' and we're winnin'
I'm cruisin' with a vision that is movin' on a mission
And you're trippin' just to listen, always knew me as the sickest true?

[Hook: Kerser]
Put 'em there, you can line 'em up
We can tell that they're biting us
We don't care 'cause we're high enough
So we light it up, come get high with us
Put 'em there, you can line 'em up
We can tell that they're biting us
We don't care 'cause we're high enough
So we light it up, come get high with us

[Verse 2: Rates]
I never cared if they were taking offence, Rates
I made sure it ain't a name you forget, wait
I ain't finished, stack 'em up on my plate
I stumble the rappers afraid put 'em back in their place, ashamed
I had to keep it up, thinking back when I said
"Always loved this heaps, I never rap for a trend"
I was using the pens as a drum, smashing my test
I got some talent and skills, I couldn't graff with my friends
I was too busy dropping styles that I could run with
Every time we drop a track, these rappers couldn't fuck with
I'm standin' proud and they fallin' down with one hit
I've been around with every noun down
When the drum hits, clown on the fuckwits, I take over
What we original innovators, we take what we want
You can face what we got, see you're long gone
We the brothers we backing you know the bond's strong

[Hook: Kerser]
Put 'em there, you can line 'em up
We can tell that they're biting us
We don't care 'cause we're high enough
So we light it up, come get high with us
Put 'em there, you can line 'em up
We can tell that they're biting us
We don't care 'cause we're high enough
So we light it up, come get high with us

[Bridge: Rates]
Come on now you feel the vibe with us and I know
We put our heart in time and time for the show
This is real, it will die with us and we go
So put ‘em there, you can line ‘em up and they know
Come on now you feel the vibe with us and I know
We put our heart in time and time for the show
This is real, it will die with us and we go
So put ‘em there, you can line ‘em up and they know

[Hook: Kerser]
Put 'em there, you can line 'em up
We can tell that they're biting us
We don't care 'cause we're high enough
So we light it up, come get high with us
Put 'em there, you can line 'em up
We can tell that they're biting us
We don't care 'cause we're high enough
So we light it up, come get high with us
