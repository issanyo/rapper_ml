[Intro]
The Nebulizer

[Verse 1]
I walked in, kicked the door like "where the fuck the safe at?"
Since I hit fifteen, one rule, make cash
And I can rap, it goes hand in hand
Before I drop an album, music banging [?] the man
I'm only being real, no gimmick needed
Drop it and these kids'll eat it
Got these veterans pissed off
I mean because they can't get near it
So you fear it and the jealousy will turn to hate
Shit, I've had my best mates go and turn away
People on my back, the CD needs release dates
While I've got mates in prison and they waiting on release dates
For pete's sake, nah, fuck's sake, you must hate
Put the whole scene in a body bag, suffocate
You fuckin' fake and all you rappers are wack
I blow a cone in your face and cause an asthma attack
Now, how dramatic is that? That I can actually rap
And have the backing of lads, packing gats in their dacks

[Hook]
I'm taking over and there's nothing you can do now
I'm on my way, I'd rather fuckin' tell her move out
Don't need radio, the streets are my connection
Any second, watch me wreck 'em, now the labels need protection
Watch me get 'em

[Verse 2]
I'm getting off my head, no time for hooks, I got a lot to say
Wait, I call every rapper out, they don't want it, ay
What a pity, in my city getting greedy with a fiddy
And a iddy biddy chitty chatty atta piggy
The new king, need a crown for my head
You panadol rappers, on my fucking allergies spread
A bit paranoid, now you see the kid with an axe
And, if I drop that shit, I've got a shiv in my dacks
But I ain't a fucking dog, you wanna swing em? Then I got you lad
But they don't want to do it 'cause they heard that Rates has got my back
How you gonna run this marathon with no shoes?
My life is kind of like my battles, yeah, cos I don't lose
You think I joking brother, next up for assassination
Rap amazing, smack your face with acid spray and catch a K
I looking through this microscope, you think it's kind of dope
What you mean? We've tried to leave that out I'll fucking tie the rope

[Hook]
I'm taking over and there's nothing you can do now
I'm on my way, I'd rather fuckin' tell her move out
Don't need radio, the streets are my connection
Any second, watch me wreck 'em, now the labels need protection
Watch me get 'em
I'm taking over and there's nothing you can do now
I'm on my way, I'd rather fuckin' tell her move out
Don't need radio, the streets are my connection
Any second, watch me wreck 'em, now the labels need protection
Watch me get 'em
So watch me get 'em
So watch me get 'em
