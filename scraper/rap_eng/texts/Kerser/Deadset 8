[Intro: Caleb Followill & Kerser]
I've been roaming around, always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places
I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you and all you know
And how you speak
Countless lovers under cover
Of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Fuck, you got a camera again?
Deadset, yo
(Someone like you)

[Verse: Kerser]
Fuck's happenin'? Yeah, it's been a minute
Drinkin' bleach, what you mean you're meant to clean with it?
I'm killin' cunts like the pingers of Defcon
I turn into a coma if my shit ever slept on
Got my Sportsbet lookin' like a bank account
What I'm on, shit, I ain't 'bout to say it loud
Dank beats, same streets got the playlist
Delete it all, name it Kers if you play this
This the part where I start gettin' selfish
Eighth deadset man, I do it 'cause I sell ticks
Melbourne first and I think I gotta drive
'Cause the shit that I'm takin' is too [?] to fly with
VRC, yeah, the Kers is back
In the CBD with the purple dacked
They love the Kers 'cause I'm never known to tone down
Hit that stage and it's feelin' like a hometown
Oh now, in Melbs, off my head bruz
She head bang, let's see what her head does
Next up, it's a party bruh
I wipe my arse with the invite for the ARIAs, huh
Syndey, yeah, my home is next
Still get good reception if my phone was dead, yeah
This the vibe that we live, we in Sydney
I rep [?] everyone [?]
Got a bitch here, lookin' like she Britney
You know three, you should leave him here with hickeys
Come along, I'ma be at The Metro
Won't be the first time I killed a metro
Thanks Syd, gotta jet to the next day
Fuck a wave man, I set the whole template
Adelaide, what the fuck is up?
You know I'm 'bout to say that I love your bud, ayy
Fuck me, I'ma be in a paywag
If I'm getting caught with what's in my saddybag
ADL, that's the city of churches
Change that shit to your city is Kerser's
Jump around bitch, I wanna see you got tits
Forgot to say, get your tickets now from Oztix
Ayy, Perth, yeah, the man is back
With a venue change, you demanded that
So I'm in Perth city, yeah, the cunts are back
On stage, got 'em feelin' like Hunter's back (Rest in peace)
Shout out to the SBX
P-city, Kers one, yeah, I get respect
West side of Oz in a pink hummer
Said a name but we just call her dick sucker
Got a bitch here lookin' like Jennifer
Lopez, and know too I'm gettin' head off her
It's Deadset, yeah, a different kind
This is Deadset eight, can you picture nine?
Got some bills that I bring to Tas
The only place that I've seen six fingers at, ha
That's a joke, don't be stupid lad
I love Tas cunt, I got a crew in Tas
Lock it in, eighteenth of May
Got the whole crowd screamin' ABK
Still the same crew wylin' out
Still rep ABK, how you like me now?
Still twenty-two-five to the day I die
Still Kers, same cunt, every day I'm high
Still blow weed, still drop my bars
Still make Bitcoin, still top the charts
I'm the line at the end, I'm the bolts and nuts
Now I'm headin' off to Bris 'cause it's off its guts
What can I say? Man, I'm lovin' Bris
Came on her face, guess I dumped my kids
Eaton Hill, shit, I said that right
I said that all wrong back in number five
Bris city, sick city, yeah, the shit litty
Can't wait to be back, poppin' six biccies
After Bris man, I'm up to Cairns
Ask anyone I meet but I love my fans
Backstage, red eyes with a blunt lit
Any state, any town, man I run shit
But this place like paradise
And my fans like a cold, they can sacrifice
Effortless tremendous chains hang from Benzas
Maintain my meds and they sway my message
Get tickets, Lifestyle is the next step
If you mix that with a bit of No Rest
You knew what it was when I blew up, true cunt
Made a lot of money 'cause my tunes are too tough
Breakin' all the records and I moved up, crews past
Through me in the middle like I tuned up two sluts
Really ain't a fresher MC than the Kerser
Put you in the ER, follow by murder
Wait a minute, gotta flip the shit
Work it out for yourself, man I'm sick with this
From Mel to Tas and Perth and back
And Adelaide, I'm a Sydney lad, fact
Real rap, sliced up in the flavour
Year later, had my weed in a paper
Smooth flow, don't be trippin', think I'm lazy
Untouchable, they try to recreate me
Lifestyle guarantee is the best yet
I'ma see you at the shows, Deadset
