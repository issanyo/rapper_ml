[Verse 1]
Told her Told her, Give her what
I don't got no patience I ain't no D.O.C (D.O.C.)
Threw her back up in the air there wasn’t no seat (wasn't no seat)
Why my section starting to look like KOD (KOD)
Man I heard that was your bitch, why she on me? (why she on me)
We takin' shots now after shots, now shootin' threes (swish, swish, swish)
Start-up button, I push it ain’t no key (no)
I say baby, you say that pussy is for free
Can your pussy do it for my Gs? (my niggas)
I know shawty buy the dope that's a key (that's a key)
I hit her up with the pipe, she OD (she OD)
Brim low, Gucci Shades
Michael Jack, shawty bad yeah that's me
Eyes red off the Canada flag
I got way more hoes than your daddy has
Pull up on a valet, front door the Bent
Way you move that don’t make no sense

[Hook]
She checkin bags like she bout to trip it
Shake that ass for a couple digits
Make a nigga wanna hit or miss it
Showin' out got everybody attention
She checkin bags like she bout to trip it
Shake that ass for a couple digits
Make a nigga wanna hit or miss it
Showin' out got everybody attention

[Verse 2]
Titties jumping while that ass be clapping for me
She go stupid with the head she gimme dummy
She a magician always could point out a trick
We in the bathroom and she always with the shits
On my Welvin, Who ain't got no bitches?
Somebody scratch my fingers they be itchin
No limits, just limited edition
I ain't tryna wife, I'm tryna mistress
Yeah Yeah
This a jungle theres plenty hoes
You know I gotta wear camouflage
Got 'bout three hoes on the microphone, I tell 'em "harmonize"
Everyday I gotta get it, gotta take care of the squad
Made up like my lesbians all out in Lebanon

[Hook]
She checkin bags like she bout to trip it
Shake that ass for a couple digits
Make a nigga wanna hit or miss it
Showin’ out got everybody attention
She checkin bags like she bout to trip it
Shake that ass for a couple digits
Make a nigga wanna hit or miss it
Showin' out got everybody attention

[Verse 3]
Aye man I swear these hoes in here for everybody
She in my ear like JD afterparty
What she do to the dick off the molly
Pourin' up, knuck and buck with everybody
Had her screaming louder in my Maserati
Neck and wrist on Slick Rick La Di Da Di
I'mma leave with his bitch probably probably
Swear I went and bought the ship Harakari
Know these niggas out here carbon copy
