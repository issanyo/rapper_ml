[Verse: 1]
I fuckin' been here before
I got the pigs at the door
I'm pumping 2Pac Shakur
And to the dogs I don't talk
But cunts are sussing me out
They tell me prove what I bought
I tell em check the fucking charts
They accuse me of more
I need these cunts off my back
I just wanna get high
But it feels like they gon' follow till the day that I die
Get the fuck from the front, cunt
I smell like success I fuckin' hip hop while its dry
Yeah I'm smelling the sex
I'm feeling the stress yet I'm still feeling the edge
My eyes are red blood shot and I built my defense
I'm getting chased by these models
While you be paying at brothels
But I'm only lighting hoes if they came with a bottle
I'm the man of the  moment
Man my moment is potent
I'm exploding I wrote it
That means its only the dopest
You know that...

[Hook]
I don't need another chance to prove myself
I  put the street shit on the map
Yea we did it ourselves
We get high, we get high
And I'm aiming for the stars
I was broke as fuck
Now I'm getting that money still smokin' up
We get high, we get high

[Verse 2]
I start ironing your face
So we can get some shit straight
I've been fucking killing rap since I dropped my mixtape
I'm going hard with the rap, if I gave half of it back
I'd still be running Aussie hip hop still I'm laughing at Jacks
That's why they all listen, from the kids in the commission
To the people running businesses, I got Australia spinning
Watch me ball hard, imma show it all of
With my middle finger up, like look at what you don't got
I'm rockin' city to city I'm rockin' flight to flight
I ain't like none of these rappers probably fight tonight
Yea I got it like that, I swear I'm living life laugh too
I'm driving round the city and my car got a glass roof
Rose up from the gutter a bit of bread and some butter
But I never need nada did this shit on my oda
Need to say it anymore let me jump up the crime rate
Buy and sell guns I'm just wasting my time mate

[Hook]
I don't need another chance to prove myself
I  put the street shit on the map
Yea we did it ourselves
We get high, we get high
And I'm aiming for the stars
I was broke as fuck
Now I'm getting that money still smokin' up
We get high, we get high
