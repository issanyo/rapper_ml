[Intro: Foo Fighters (sampled) & Kerser]
I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you
Were you born to resist or be abused?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Oh fuck, you got a camera again?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Feels like I’ve said that before

[Verse: Kerser]
Fuck's happening? Yeah, it’s been a minute
They surprised I’m alive 'cause I’ve been the sickest
Bitches dance, get your hands in the air now
Shave your pussy, I’m just saying let your hair down
They all ask for a photo, what?
Put grenades on you phone, that’s a photobomb
Getting under your skin, yeah you rap like a homo
Probably get offended if I told you to vote no
I’m the reason why your bitch is late
It’s Deadset seven, can you picture eight?
I’m a different guy, make you hit subscribe
Then delete every video I think you like
Let me tell you 'bout the tour I'ma get you in the hot shit
Hit pause here and get your tickets now from Oztix
Spin it right round, we start in Tas
Snort half the rack and beat a heart attack, back
On stage, I’m fightin' on
In Tassie on the cloud, but I’m twice as strong
They love me here and I’m rapping it fat
Hit stage so hard ain’t a gap in the MAB
Tour starts there on the tenth of March
Tripping out on stage can’t forget my bars
Tas know the G-O, know the beast flow
Gonna fall asleep right where the weed grows
Next up: fuck yes, it’s Vic
Melbourne crowd some hectic shit
Touch down off a plane, drive round in a rental
Copper chasing that but I ran out of petrol
Back to the venue, Kers on the menu
I ain’t even sneeze but they all say “bless you”
No stress, I'm like a local there
They call me King Kers, they know I’m the man
I’m at the casino spending the green notes
M-E-L-B-OURNE let me breathe bro
Oz ARIA, number one
It’s in the charts, they were like "fuck another one"
What else do you expect from Kers?
Twenty-third of the third when I land in Perth
Jumpin’ off a plane and I’m off my head
Tripping out like I got a fuckin' wonky leg
Can’t fuck with Kers, I’m loving Perth
People can’t say a lot without a hundred words
But it’s all good bro I’m the fuckin' man
If I write you a rap, it’s a hundred grand
Anyway yo, Perth is sick
Good all around like a perfect tit
Now I’m hitting my hometown, bringing my own crown
Wear it on stage like Sydney got the throne now
Ah fuck the crowd is nuts
And my ears kinda hurt 'cause they’re loud as fuck
Feel so high, I could fly away
Put my dish in the box like a microwave
Oh shit yeah Kers is back
And you can’t get rid of me I’m like a herpie rash
Sydney’s on April sixth
On stage with sunnies cause I’m baked as shit
You know how Kerser do
Yeah I’m rich but I still take a purse from you
And the tour got me fucked up, let me chill
Got you seeing double like a eccy pill
Gonna get in trouble 'cause I mentioned drugs
Got the game on fire, check the temperature
Sydney going crazy, let's fuck it up
Got the spliffs in the air now jump you cunt
We run a muck, from the day to night
And we don’t need a plane to be stayin' high
Speaking of bud, Adelaide is next
Out of everyone bud, Adelaide the best
So we blaze a sesh there and celebrate
Every step that I take man, I elevate
Ate a mushroom now I got a belly ache
Did I mention I was high on the telly mate?
When they sat me there right next to a ho
Some feminist bloke name Jessica Rowe
Fuck her off, Adelaide was sick
I mean I think it was, I can’t remember it
Now the Q-L-D still high as fuck
Run a competition, see who got the tightest cunt
Fuck waiting for me at Eaton Hills
I was there two years ago, I’m peaking still
Thanks Bris, now I’m up to Cairns
Had to add a show yeah, 'cause I never been there
Fuck man their King has arrived
They said I love myself, is that a big surprise?
I didn’t think so, Cairn’s know what’s up
I could hit an alley-oop if you throw me bud
In Cairns with a can, you can tell that I’m high right
Cutting off your hands and I ask for a high five
Oh yes, you know we high
So if you in Cairns get to know me right
King Kers with a capital K
Racking up lines at the back of the stage
Better stop there, they’ll cancel gigs
Are you off your head, don’t answer this
I’m a beast when I flow and I set the trends
Get the whole country saying "Deadset" again
Too swag and I’m sitting in a sports car
I could turn a good girl into a pornstar
Have her going off tracks like a D-rail
Film the shit, I could send it to your email
Heard you hate me, time it as you hold breath
I just got new diamonds in my Rolex
I'ma get you stamped like an X pill
When Kers on the mic, man it gets real
Sydney representing till my death yep
I don’t know but I’m pretty sure I met death
Might have been 'cause I haven’t even slept yet
Everyone tellin' me I gotta get rest
This is it, gonna go, don’t you stress, yes
Just get ready with a sesh, till your head's wrecked
"Engraved In The Game" is the best yet
I'ma see you at the shows, Deadset
