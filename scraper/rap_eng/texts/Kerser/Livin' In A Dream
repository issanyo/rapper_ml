[Verse 1:]
Got what I need by rolling weed
I'm a bag of bud, you're a bowl of seeds
On a plane now looking down on clouds
Where all the people that doubt me now?
Haters come and turn to fans
Why some fans hate? Don't understand
That when you're high and at the top
And come from nothing you have to plot
You have to brag cause they all laugh
And you're on stage and living large
Hope that paints a picture bruh
You still hating? Couldn't give a fuck
Positive vibes, on the beach
With my girl and we outta reach
Haters dead, ain't allowed to speak
I made it too where we happened to be?
Phew...
Thought I was lost for a bit right there
Lucky I stuck to this shit god damn
Me and my girl got outta there
Rolling up that good shit
Mixing up that good mix
Money in the bank I'm good bitch
I can see the future it looks sick

[Hook:]
Pile up that green
Notes thick and mean
Living in a dream
Came true cause I'm me
Still smoking weed on a plane counting cash
Ain't no time to hate on no one, let me just go get smashed
I'm rolling with my brothers
We all come up from nothing
Paradise we laughing
Gold on the neck never tuck it
I made it, I made it
Sitting here all faded
Never be outdated
I'm gonna let the fake hate it

[Verse 2:]
I'm gonna make you chill cunts
It's kinda like a pill does
I got the gift, you feel buzzed
We smoking on them real buds
I fell asleep on my plane ride
Woke up, gotta stay high
Then I gotta hit that stage right
I'm blinded by the stage lights
What a life to live huh?
Ups and downs but I need a
Bit of space, a breather
I don't wanna leave the game either
I live for rap, no giving back
What I work so hard for picture that
Started with nothing but a broken pen
But I made the pen the focus again
Through all the shit, all the drugs
All the hate, all the love
They call us up, better warn the cunts
That I'm staying up the top till' I'm bored as fuck
Ch-yea...
And we out around, every single state the crowd is out
I got the gift, it's all the Kers
ABK we rose from the dirt

[Hook:]
Pile up that green
Notes thick and mean
Living in a dream
Came true cause I'm me
Still smoking weed on a plane counting cash
Ain't no time to hate on no one, let me just go get smashed
I'm rolling with my brothers
We all come up from nothing
Paradise we laughing
Gold on the neck never tuck it
I made it, I made it
Sitting here all faded
Never be outdated
I'm gonna let the fake hate it
