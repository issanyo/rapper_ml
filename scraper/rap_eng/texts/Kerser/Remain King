[Intro]
Oi Dave
I just took four pills
Someone left 'em here
And I don't know what they were
My head's spinning
And the whole room's moving
I'm just gonna spit my verse
Look

[Verse 1]
My next interview, I'ma pull down my pants
Live on air like "fuck the world, I'm doing a dance"
And I'm not from Adelaide so I don't say "chance"
I'm a south-west Syd kid chopping plants
It's the way that I am, it's probably wrong to a few
But my music's for my fans, it's not offered to you
I'ma bust out verses perfect and I'm earning
Big fucking stacks, got these other rappers burning
You faggots never talk your shit to my face
It's always in the studio or you type on your page
But even that's coming to a stop, shit this is crazy
Probably 'cause they know I get 'em killed with your lady
"What up baby?" winking her eye
I tell my killer "send a photo of her drinking some dye"
Yeah, bleach her insides and put the mic up her arse
Twenty pills popped before I'm even writing my bars bitch

[Hook]
They see me shine, they see me win
It hurts their pride, I laugh inside
And they still whine 'cause I'm the kind to remain King
I run this scene
They see me shine, they see me win
It hurts their pride, I laugh inside
And they still whine 'cause I'm the kind to remain King
I run this scene

[Verse 2]
I got my roof rolled back, looking at the sky
You've got the who sold crack fucking looking eyes
What you know about flowing with rap
And earning so much you flip out when you owing em tax? (fuck)
'Cause my tax bill bigger than your yearly wage
I'm the lad still sipping on the clearest day
I'm the hash pill pimping like I'm here to stay
I'm the rash, got you itching 'cause you feel my pain
I make your head explode with just one of my rhymes
I'm like Andrew Johns on drugs in my prime
I'm like Mike eighteen round one when Pac died
To say I've got an attitude, you ain't even seen my dark side
Kers one, I ain't ever had to lay low
But you's did once Shoey fucking came home
We stay real with the crew till the end
Fuck your peace 'cause here we've got unity man and

[Hook]
They see me shine, they see me win
It hurts their pride, I laugh inside
And they still whine 'cause I'm the kind to remain King
I run this scene
They see me shine, they see me win
It hurts their pride, I laugh inside
And they still whine 'cause I'm the kind to remain King
I run this scene

[Verse 3]
Triple popping pills while they still in a saddy bag
I couldn't wait, if you ask I just had to lad
It's the way I am, yeah I'm on a detox
I'm getting tested, who wants to wee swap?
'Cause my piss filled with LSD
And I've never ever, ever, ever, ever been clean
They say the Kers gets repetitive
Well I like to blame that on the sedatives
Yeah I said it kid, don't fucking do drugs
Next minute biting belts as you shoot up
What the fuck? You ain't even listen lad
Now I've gotta write a whole new mission pat
To get cunts clean, throw jabs like Mundine
Holding knives in both hands, wanna make a cunt bleed
O plus G's, I'm sipping lean
I don't need a Nebs beat to be spitting mean, yep

[Hook]
They see me shine, they see me win
It hurts their pride, I laugh inside
And they still whine 'cause I'm the kind to remain King
I run this scene
They see me shine, they see me win
It hurts their pride, I laugh inside
And they still whine 'cause I'm the kind to remain King
I run this scene
