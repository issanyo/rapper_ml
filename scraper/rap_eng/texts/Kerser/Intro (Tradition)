[Spoken: Rick Regan]
One man
One Kerser
One king
The one record labels hate
Banned from radio stations
The sickest cunt to ever step in front of a microphone
Campbelltown to beaches
Train stations to range rovers
Casios to Rolexes
Six albums in six years
The only rapper dropping nothing but hits
Ladies and gentlemen, prepare your ears
Because they're about to be blown off your fucking heads
You're now tuning into the sickest
