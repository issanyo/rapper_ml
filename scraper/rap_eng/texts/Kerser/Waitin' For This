[Verse 1:]
I'm a C-Town boy, that never changed kid
Always rep for the hood, I'ma save this
Moved to the beach, came back the same week
Hopped out a range rover with a blazed spliff
Insane sick, the Kers, the cunt that rose up
The same rapper killing crews, man they froze up
Album six, so ridiculous
They call me wack, then copy Kers, they some hypocrites
Listen this, it's the shit you've been waiting on
I got a crew that'll kill you, come and take it gronk
God changed Oz rap, now he's gonna stop that
Making money, drop tracks, why they copy Scott? mad!
I take it as a compliment
Cos you wanna be me, fuck, you make it obvious
And my fans know, they can see right through it, bitch
Okay, that's off my chest, now watch me as I ruin this

[Hook:]
Won't stop, won't quit, put the trust here
Not scared to get popped, shived cause its fuck fear
Whole life, I've been waiting for this
I mean, I die for this shit so come and ride for the king
Won't stop, won't quit, put the trust here
Not scared to get popped, shived cause its fuck fear
Whole life, I've been waiting for this
I mean, I die for this shit so come and ride for the king

[Verse 2:]
Grabbing and dabbing a bitch's head like a rabbit
Yeah, I got a bad habit, my rap attacking you faggots
And, no, it has to to tragic, get me back up on my Kers shit
So sick that they want to bring the nurse in
Every album that I drop, hitting number one
They're used to it by now like, yeah, another one
Still, fuck the radio, do it on my own mate
Blowing stations up with a bomb that is homemade
Okay, is that a terrorist threat?
And has the media decided what they're calling it yet?
I never gave a fuck and man I'm still the same way
I did my first clip in a fucking lane way
Now I'm at the top, money my priority
Never let it in the way of my loyalty
You get excited when you knowing that the Kers arrive
It's going to be the same way til the Kerser dies

[Hook:]
Won't stop, won't quit, put the trust here
Not scared to get popped, shived cause its fuck fear
Whole life, I've been waiting for this
I mean, I die for this shit so come and write for the king
Won't stop, won't quit, put the trust here
Not scared to get popped, shived cause its fuck fear
Whole life, I've been waiting for this
I mean, I die for this shit so come and write for the king

[Verse 3:]
Ain't it better that you heard on this Oz map
I don't make hip hop, I make boss rap
Attitude's dark, cunt staying the same
I've been here a long time, I'm just playing the game
Give me awards, fucking give me applause
Now lay on floor and get the money out your drawers
It's the stick up shit, I'm the sickest kid
Should've listened in, I'm the friggen king

[Hook:]
Won't stop, won't quit, put the trust here
Not scared to get popped, shived cause its fuck fear
Whole life, I've been waiting for this
I mean, I die for this shit so come and write for the king
Won't stop, won't quit, put the trust here
Not scared to get popped, shived cause its fuck fear
Whole life, I've been waiting for this
I mean, I die for this shit so come and write for the king
