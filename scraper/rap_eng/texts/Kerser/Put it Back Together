I've watched my life go and crumble
Then I put it back together
Swear to god I almost left but
Now I'll make this last forever
I just finished reading letters
From my boys that doing stretchers
I wrote back and sent my love I told them
Life can be a mess it's kind of hard
To move along and act like they ain't missing nothing
These the cards that we were given
Gotta turn this into something
So I

Blazed up wrote a rap just to help cope
Feeling buckled in the middle like a belt bro
Time flys move quick gotta keep up
Never in life will I touch another sweet puff
Cause these drugs are the devil in disguise
The music is the drug I need to get me through my life
Sounding corny tell me what will be the outcome
I still smoke weed, pop pills but I out done
Other shit so I threw it away
Woke up one morning, I won't do it today
And so I did and every day the picture kinda getting better
Cause I'm holding on my cheddar gotta double this forever
Life in the public
Said a lot of dumb shit
Done a lot of dumb shit but every time I tongue flip
It's magic and I'm saving lives
Two bad days means that I saved you twice

So hold on keep your head up
Stay staunch don't you fall and crumble
That's what they want fuck them all, don't let them try and burst your bubble
Light that weed and pour that drink and tell me what you gotta go for
This your life you just a you and don't you listen to a known whore
Break your heart and now you thinking, fuck it man this isn't worth it
You don't need it you just want it, move along and it be perfect

I ain't preaching what to do I ain't a hypocrite
Just gotta let you know in time you gonna flip the script
And fuck up like fuck fuck you fucked up
You dumb cunt don't tou-touch the glass glass
I've watched it ruin lives, turn the strong into the weak
Don't you touch that ice, have a bong and go to sleep
I felt the need to tell you you ain't really need to store it
Kids will hear their parents turn and blame me

Never said for you to touch it
I just told you I was messed up
And my raps are what my life is
So I had to go and fess up
Once again I talked my mind
And that is one thing they can't handle
Made mistakes but I bounce back
And now I'm here to light the candle
Make your own path don't you follow
Only you know who you is kid

People ask me what the rapper that I like to pump
I say myself because I do and I don't hide it nah
Sometimes this rapping feels like this the only shit for me
Then other days I hate it man it's got me spinning heaps
My flows sicker and you so so bitter, I'm a go go getter
You a no show let me...
Say another word I'm the truth with this
Move quick pass out like a roofie mix
Who is this now I'm covered in teeth marks
Everyone wanna bite me in these bars
Speak up you got something to say
Block your ears from my rap you get fucked in the face
Nothing remains and nothing is fake

You can judge me, I don't give a fuck cause I am being myself
You are fake and you don't know me so you cannot fuck with my words
Try to warn them I'm not playing I am taking over this shit
They ain't listen then it happened now they tripping bird I love it
Tell them I will never leave and then tell my fans that I love them
Tell them buy this, tell them buy that
Tell them I'm high and I'm laughing
I am gonna end this now cause I'm too stoned to continue
Too stoned to continue, too stoned to continue
