Hold the tears back nows the time for you to get away end of day
We all know that you be in that better place
Member you was 12 me and boobs would get our drink on
You was in the garage asking us if we could spit songs
I think on
I think even further back
And even not so long ago you flipped when you heard the track
That I pressed record but still it ain't about Scott
Just wanted to let you know that man I swear to god it meant alot
We rep st Andrews you was there and you was down too
Now its fucked up coz now they say its where they found you its not even right
That some gronk with a knife wouldn't drop it and fight now its cost you your life nah
Keep your head up up in heavens where you now live
Want to let you know we sent your fam some flowers your presence had effect on everyone remembers you
So I sip my drink your still on earth we just pretend its true

Bullshit dramas
They say its over two cans
Someone pulled a knife they tried to be a big man
It ain't the same but so many feel ya pain
Written down in sentence man
I dont know what to say
You said you played my shit atleast like fifteen times a day
I swear to god when you said that I got goosebumps and walked away
I wasn't being rude I hope you never thought I was
You know I wasn't lad
I was shocked and had to walk it off
They tell me you was even scribblin' down your own rhymes
I heard ya dad found out about ya different phone lines
Its fucked up it not fair is god there
With much love
We got there
Its not rare
Lad he took you coz he picked you out of who you are
As much as people miss ya man he musta needed ya
You was younger but I had the chance to meet ya man
Light my spliffs hit my drink untill we ever meet again

Ain't spitten no hard rhymes
Night time your star shines
It ain't eazy but I guess its a hard life
Wish you knew the impact
That you really did have
Your up there looking down feet up now sit back
This that
Dedication that is write for you
Kick back relax for you to listen to your boys keep telling me that you looked up to my rhymes and honestly it shouldn't but it really fucks with my mind
So the least I can do
Is release this for you
And play it so fucking loud that the speakers will blew
As I reach for a brew
And now im speaking to you
I'll state the obvious
You really leaving to soon
Your killers will get karma
Yip twice as harder
Tod Burrows jr named after ya father
From the west to east they may respect and speak
Dedication real rhymes lad rest in peace
