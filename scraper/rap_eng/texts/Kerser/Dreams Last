I want to go to a place where dreams will last forever
Dreams will last forever more
I want to go to a place where dreams will last forever
Dreams will last forever more

[Verse 1: Kerser]
Massive blunt rolled, I'm about to light it up
Just let me be the highest one
I don't listen to no wack shit
She in bikinis doin' backflips
In the presence of a king, high
They get excited shit it's hard for them to think right
I'm on my live life, jet ski with the fridge type
Matching Gucci shit I ain't never leaving this life
Style anyways
Swag I'm running million leaps and bounds from an alley way
Where I started or that bridge that crossed the M-5
That's Campbelltown learn about it I'm the test, I
Proved it could be done with every thing up in your way
If you can't respect that, man come on, you're stuck in hate
They tried to drag my name through the mud, it didn't work
I was warned that's what they do when you be sitting first, it's Kers

I want to go to a place where dreams will last forever
Dreams will last forever more
I want to go to a place where dreams will last forever
Dreams will last forever more

[Verse 2: Kerser]
I broke records, are they ever going to bring that up?
Sitting with like fifty cunts
I don't even know you
Who let you in my showroom?
The purple mixed and
Now I'm on a mission, lay down competition
Effortless, I'm winning, ain't care 'bout what they thinking
My jewellery has 'em blinking, I'm living in a weekend
Which proves I'm winning and I'm living how I'm supposed to
Joints are different when you light 'em down the coast, true
It's my rap dream, that shit be my energiser
I'm still spending money I made off The Nebulizer
What the point in dreaming when your dream is your life?
Still paranoid, if you search my jeans, you'll find a knife
But we staying positive
I'm party and I knock some shit
I still got that side in me that I have with my three lines
That battle shit will die in me, it's Kers you want to be like
You're jealous hurt, they want me dead in the dirt
Let me chill for a second, who said second? I'm first
It's Kers

I want to go to a place where dreams will last forever
Dreams will last forever more (I'm making dreams last)
I want to go to a place where dreams will last forever (That 225 shit)
Dreams will last forever more
I want to go to a place where dreams will last forever
Dreams will last forever more
I want to go to a place where dreams will last forever
Dreams will last forever more
Dreams will last forever more
