[Hook: Nat M]
Lay it all out on the table
For everybody else to see
Some may think that I'm not able
To achieve one of my dreams
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them

[Verse 1: Kerser]
Lets go back to '09 when my tape dropped
The industry blocked me out, they always hated Scott
But it's okay cos I'm a fighter, dropped another one
A year later out the gutter down the drain son
And all the albums with Nebs, we had 'em scratchin' their heads
Topping ARIA charts over and over again;
Now they hitting my phone, wanting the latest of news
Had me losing my mind, I was kinda confused
'Cause they labelled me a criminal
They heard about a drive-by and tried to paint a visual
But, way before that, I was spitting raw rap
Walking round Cambelltown hoping we could score that;
Reminds me of all them freezing cold nights
Running mucks getting chased by them bright lights;
Now I hit the stage you said I'd never make it
I'm a superstar, let me rub it in your faces!

[Hook: Nat M]
Lay it all out on the table
For everybody else to see
Some may think that I'm not able
To achieve one of my dreams
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them

[Verse 2: Kerser]
Let's go back to like now when this shit drop
They tried to say i wouldn't make it in the hip-hop
Yeah I was there too
Everyone doubtin' me
Other than the crew and everyone surrounding me;
I came from nothing but a dream in the bedroom
To headlining shows, making money, and yes you
Can do it to, no matter what your situation
You're thinking 'how?', Shit!
Let me be your inspiration
I had the chattiest clothes, I had em tapping my phone
I had the raps in my dome, I did collapse at a show
'Cause I had too many drugs, then they labelled us thugs
But every website couldn't stop writing 'bout us
The team at the top, we are the cream of the crop
You got a dream you don't stop
And every tear that I've dropped, man I've done it for my fans
If you ever feel down you just gotta stop and...

[Hook: Nat M]
Lay it all out on the table
For everybody else to see
Some may think that I'm not able
To achieve one of my dreams
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them
I'ma keep chasing them

[Outro: Kerser & Nat M]
'Til I make it
I kept telling myself
'Til I make it
I kept telling myself
'Til I make it
I kept telling myself
You can't quit, you gotta stack up the wealth
'Til I make it
I kept telling myself
'Til I make it
I kept telling myself
'Til I make it
I kept telling myself
You can't quit, you gotta stack up the wealth
