[Chorus]
I'm not scared of your stolen power
See right through you any hour
You'll be taking it slow
Feeding my flame
Shuffling the cards of your game
And just in time
In the right place
Suddenly I will play my ace

[Verse 1]
A fucking mess man [?]
I wanna see your head slam
I threaten with weapons
They say they hold my blessing
In a shitty rap scene, fucking rappers do my head in
Think they on my level but they Facebook on a webcam
I wear my gold wherever, you might catch me in an ally
If you say you gonna get me, god have mercy on your balley[?]
Ri-ridiculous, so sick of this, predicted it that I ripped the shit
The critics hit, try rip to bits the difference is that I live for this
They criticize how I live my life but I come from the bottom
Got rich, you cried
Why oh why did I hate so much deny and deny now they ain't my stuff[?]
I'll take you to my old style that'll leave you in a hole stole[?]
You realized that the whole world these rappers took my whole style
Never been mad just move along, I made it clear that I'm moving on
Till I die make abusive songs, my main victory I proved em' wrong
Just go hard till album 10
Blame xanex or the valium
Cause at the top it's kinda strange
ABK till my dying day

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I chase the dreams and I make sure that they all come true
That's why they hate cause they can't make theirs real
Yeah they got 1 too
Fuckin' skitzin lately attitude been stuck on fuck you
If you think that's gonna change, you fucking sucked the nuts too
Blacklisted from Triple J, they didn't think I'd get by
But I topped like every chart, my names now in the headlines
What you think about Kers or Scott? Fuck school too
I was burning pot, bad advise fucking turn me off
Here's some more never work a job
What you take me for a piece of shit?
Till I saved your kid he was feening this
I helped when harm, I'll leave a twist
My last enemy had bleeding lips
That stopped the talking, why you stalking?
Kerser round you see me balling
My boys strapped with itchy fingers
Talking stops when it hits your winders
Fucken crazy ain't it, don't care if you rate it, hate it
Since I came into the game, the most hated is what I stay with
No one ever cop the hate first like the Kers man
And fuckin' spin out, half you haters turn to Kerser fans, facts

[Chorus]
