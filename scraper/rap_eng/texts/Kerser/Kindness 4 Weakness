Don’t mistake my kindness for weakness
We won’t settle on your level when we’re driven to the edge
Don’t mistake my kindness for weakness
We won’t peddle to the devil in the middle of the stress

[Verse 1: Kerser]
Now-now, I’ma try and break this down the best I can, I never meant
To come across in any certain way but I do represent
The street, that’s why you met me and you thought ‘cause I was friendly
That you seen some kind of weakness, I’ll be damned, now try befriend me
But you gotta keep in mind, I’m from the streets and things are different here
You run your mouth where I grew up, you gonna cop a lifting, yeah
So, I don’t see why, when it comes to music, things are different here
They try to mould me into something, I’ma shoot and disappear
Loyalty, survival, mainstream never had the street’s voice
I’ll hit the stage at ARIA’s and tell ‘em suck a dee-oi
I don’t think there’s ever been an artist with this point of view
So watch with who you’re labeling before we come and point at you, you’re dead

We are nice guys but we try not to finish last
Come and test us then we warn you won’t be the last
We are nice guys but we try not to finish last
Come and test us then we warn you won’t be the last

[Verse 2: Kerser]
E-e-every day I am feeling the stress
Paving the way, call it building I guess
Never get time to myself and I think that I
Need to go find a way out of this mess
Moving alone on a journey and quest
Stressed out this breath 'cause it's hurting my chest
Sitting on money is burning me, yes
Spend what I've got, I am certainly fresh
People do talk and they heard of me, yes
Don't want to pass, I am burning the test
Talk about money, try earning it and
Impossible, so go searching for bread
Try not to follow, be hurting your head
If you go down, you won't surface again
Once you go under, you chunder, I wonder
If bundles of money could serve me to death
Try to be nice, but I'm earning 'em man
They gotta know that I earned where I am
People go out, he would turn for a gram
After the gram, they return for a grand
What do you do when you're permanently banned?
Industry won't ever work with you man
Find your own way, then go work with a fan
Hi, what's your name? You can worship the man, Kers one
