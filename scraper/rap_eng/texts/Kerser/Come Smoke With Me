[Intro: Fortay]
Come smoke with me
Come smoke with me, ay

[Verse 1: Fortay]
Pass the bong, pass the juice in the bar
And watch a cunt punch on like a blue at the pub
See these dumb fucks wrong, they can't do what I does
Smoking blunts fucking longer than Cuban cigars, who hah
Want to puff with the best? Then come smoke with me
Nothing but the esh in the sesh, the way its supposed to be
Something like the best in the west, but it ain't locally
Grown esh, blown by F, known for potency
Blowing when there's no spinning like Shane Warne
I'm smoking 'til I'm finished, and beginning to blaze more
Won't diminish, going with it, I stay in form
Up in the clouds getting lifted, I raise a storm
Bitch, my day long, so take schlong to your mouth
Like you're blazing bong, suck the babies from
My nutsack, I blow loads and clutch stacks
Known 'round my postcode for just that

[Verse 2: Kerser]
Good weed, bag packed with the fat stack
I'm spending this today and I am looking for that mad
Bud with the smells that can linger for days
If I was sitting on a pound, still won't give you a blaze
Greedy motherfucker when it comes to that green shit
Hundred dollar note as the paper, and weed lit
I made the weed anthem for the country to blaze to
What Fort? Who you call when you looking the way, ooh
I ain't even mention that I'm off of my guts
And I'm high from the morning to when I'm rocking the clubs
Its the Kers, with the Fortay, weed? That's for ureshay
Two of Sydney's best, got it fresh, rep the raw way
That's why you're hanging for the shit that we drop
These fuckers always watching me, someone give 'em a clock
I'm signing out with a fuck you, get fucked and thank you
We just made another fucking hit for you to blaze to

[Verse 3: Redbak]
I'm still chopping up plants, like Edward Scissorhands
And I bet you could picture that, with that Instagram
I'm amazing, my gift and [?], and all of my wits intact
After years of punching cones, bigger than witches hats
And its a fact, I write my best lyrics when I'm smashed
Then go over them like, "Fuck yeah, this is mad!"
And I still don't know who went through my hidden stash
Did I have one to begin with? Is what has me tripping bad
Fucking memory loss, I should eventually stop
But will I ever? And forever? Potentially not
Red pops out of the blue, when someone's mentioning pot
Hey boys, pack us a cone, are you sharing or what?
Honest to God, I got so much resin in my lungs
That sniffer dogs start to bark, when I'm walking past
I swear that if I ever decided to donate blood
The patient receiving it, would get an instant buzz
With some heavy waiters, wave middle finger to any haters
See us blazing j's, maybe grape flavoured blunt papers
I'm feeling weightless, in orbit, floating inside of a spaceship
That's the death tape, bitch, dock it as part of your playlist

[Outro: Kerser]
Kerser, Fortay, Redbak
South West Sydney, West Sydney
Some shit for you to blaze to
We out
