[Intro:]
No way, I'm way too high up
Yeah more beat brother
(Kerser)

[Verse 1:]
Put it up, eyes red 'cause I smoke bud
You don't even want to ask what's in the foam cup
I'm in my zone brah, that bass bang a bitch's breast
I got the weed and it's hydro, sticky-icky yes
In a big bag, separate from the glad wrap
Tablets in the bag, dacked, I'm guaranteed to have that
Daily basis, crazy ain't it? Rep my crew lad
I start to spit, I ain't say shit and rappers move back
This is king shit, why the fuck you question that
The time has come I think you bout to learn a lesson bad
I'm on the pedestal you are the faggots on your knees
I feel invincible you other maggots stopping me

[Hook:]
No way, I'm way too high up
Okay, let 'em hang, they ain't like us
So blazed won't say that I lied but
That's the reason why you fuckers couldn't find us

[Verse 2:]
So fucking fresh when I put shit down
Sit down with a sick sound, gotta spit now
Every time I write man, this shit's insane
When I'm sticking blades to your bitch's face
They ain't never find another one like me
Fast speed then my mind bleed wonder why I like weed
Hide the fact that I'm crazy, slightly
Sorry, did I mention that I like light weed?
So smooth, fresh, clean like "so what?"
You so useless, pipe with no rock
High you know Scott, fine, just don't stop
Hi, yes, you know what? I'm fried and so lost
But when it comes to rapping baby, Kerser be on top of it
Like a Molotov they try to burn what's at the top of it
But picture where the clock'll sit 'cause me, I'm like the opposite
I'm what's inside the bottle bitch, so light, up watch the bottle fizz

[Hook:]
No way, I'm way too high up
Okay, let 'em hang, they ain't like us
So blazed won't say that I lied but
That's the reason why you fuckers couldn't find us

[Verse 3:]
I'm picking it up with the sickest sound
In the district now what I spitting foul
Never see what I do live on the beat
'Cause I fight for the street and my mind on repeat
Got the street shit, dacked that, could've fucking grabbed that
Rat slapped pack in the bag that you stashed lad
Ripped off, yeah, you got fucked up bad
Now my nun chucks crack till your funds are slack
Outcome of the situation street life
No freezer needed, on the block, they like to heat ice
Yes I am, heaps nice, Aussie rapping's in my hand
I drown this shit like fuck you all, you think that I won't sink it man
Got a different plan, I'm way, way, way in front
I might your girl, I'm like stay, stay, stay you cunt
She had a glit, she nice, she looked at me like "no Scott"
Within thirty seconds, Lowies gave me blowjobs

[Hook:]
No way, I'm way too high up
Okay, let 'em hang, they ain't like us
So blazed won't say that I lied but
That's the reason why you fuckers couldn't find us

[Outro:]
In case you were wondering why you couldn't find us
'Cause you're out there
Your Lowies are following us
She's smoking my cock like an ice pipe
Shes a bad thing
She don't even need to light the rock
Got her make up her nails
Had a shower
You other faggots to, why you following
You just watch what I do
Hold on to your Lowie
She following us
