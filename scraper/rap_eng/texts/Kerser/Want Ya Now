I've got a place
We can go get comfortable
'Cause I want you now, I want you now
I want you now-ow-ow-ow-ow
I've got a place
Better tell me you'll go
'Cause I want you now, I want you now
I want you now-ow-ow-ow-ow

[Verse 1: Kerser]
Said she want him now, there was truth in that
But she didn't know his money was from movin' packs
She was shocked when she'd first seen him shoot a gat
But it turned her on too, she a loony, fact
Well, they was headed to a spot on the block where
If the light's off, you don't go and knock there
And the light's off but he don't give a fuck
He rock it in there because he ticked 'em up
He want his money back, she ask him what he doin'
He said "Nuttin' baby, just let me do it"
He opens car door, she kind of sussin' out
He says "If you hear shots, better duck down
You stay in the car, I'ma rock the lot"
He kicks down the door, he starts poppin' shots
What the fuck? She in shock like "how?"
But her next fuckin' words were still "I want you now"
Wow

[Hook: Alicia Renee]
I've got a place
We can go get comfortable
'Cause I want you now, I want you now
I want you now-ow-ow-ow-ow
I've got a place
Better tell me you'll go
'Cause I want you now, I want you now
I want you now-ow-ow-ow-ow

[Verse 2: Kerser]
My mate X got his heart broke tryin' to trust a bad bitch
She set him up, got him robbed and ain't been back since
They was way different, he was more the stoner type
She the more wild, puff a pipe and go out at night
X was in love, he really loved her to bits
I tried to tell him on the sly "you can't be trustin' the bitch"
I think he thought I was a hater, so I just left it
I told him "man, fuck her off, you livin' desperate"
Other mates ringing like she hittin' him up
I'm sayin' "X, what the fuck you think she doing in clubs?"
Fuck, he didn't listen though, then she set him up
Got him robbed, fought him back, he got shivved up
Seen a face in the car as they drove off
He leakin' blood on the floor and it won't stop
"I tried tellin' you brah, she a bad slut"
But, with these words, she had him all rapped up

[Hook: Alicia Renee]
I've got a place
We can go get comfortable
'Cause I want you now, I want you now
I want you now-ow-ow-ow-ow
I've got a place
Better tell me you'll go
'Cause I want you now, I want you now
I want you now-ow-ow-ow-ow

[Bridge: Alicia Renee]
Me and you, in our room
We can do anything
Me and you, all alone
We can do everything
Me and you, in our room
We can do anything
Me and you, all alone
We can do anything

[Verse 3: Kerser]
Gave the last words of a bitch that I knew
She'd always play Kers "who you listenin' to?"
She had a weird way of showin' that she want me around
She play dumb, lay stoned and just roll on the ground
I see through it though, I see what you're doin' ho
You're like a bad drug, tryna get me ruined, no
I ain't fall for it but I'm feelin' bad now
They read a suicide note in her bag, found
Next to her body, what, she killin' herself?
I s'pose all the hard drugs and the pills didn't help
Fuck, she was hangin' from the roof, playin' Kerser
Was it my fault? Was it all my words
Was she a mess that just couldn't be helped?
And why want to fuck me and not nobody else?
Who knows? Don't wanna know what the note said
Then I heard, this exactly what the note read:

[Hook: Alicia Renee]
I've got a place
We can go get comfortable
'Cause I want you now, I want you now
I want you now-ow-ow-ow-ow
I've got a place
Better tell me you'll go
'Cause I want you now, I want you now
I want you now-ow-ow-ow-ow
