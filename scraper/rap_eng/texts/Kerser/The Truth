[Intro]
Yeah, awh shit!
King Kerser
I'm with Nebs once again
And um, I think it's time to kick it off yeah?

[Verse 1]
Warn them I'm a problem, they ain't wanna mess with that
I jump on the cunts skull, you just wrestle rap
Believe Kers, I'm the man of this new shit
Don't send me no beats unless Nebs has produced it
It's stupid but we killing these cunts
I'm a different type of high, like putting pills in a blunt
I told 'em "once I kill the game, Ima give it a rest"
I'd rather say "Fuck 'em all" then ever sit on the fence
But that's the attitude I've gots and the attitude I carry on
Sadie bag in my luggage that I carry-on
Flight to flight, ain't no city I can't touch
Everytime my drop album, it's raising the bar up
Higher and higher, you admire my rhyming
You will never find the same, if you do they are biting
Bitches saying Nebs bangers got 'em rocking their bed
If that's the case then Kers lyrics be the cock to your head - ya ganga

[Chorus] x2
Ain't nobody really gonna care about 'em in the end
And they gonna fall and stumble, I'll be laughing off my fucking head
And you can all be taking 'bout the bullshit they be feeding you
But come back when you realise that they lying and you need the truth

[Verse 2]
ABK, that the team - we a hurricane
See me at your sister party with your brothers chained
King Kers making capital K's
Put a junior to their name if they're rapping this way (Let's go)
Kerser been the greatest, got the haters even hating
Haters not sure if they rate us, or they hate us cos their fucking ladies
Wanna fucking fuck us, fuckin' that's a lot of fucking fucking
Wonder if they cumming, if they coming I've got something they've been waiting for
My daughter, kick back like a set trap
And leave your brain on the wall, I told 'em to get back
That's what I told my lawyer, anyway it was their strap
Fingerprint that shit, my hands were not there lad
It's easy with the rapping, play it out in my head
But I will get you knocked if you out off a threat
About a brother I roll with or anything else
That will threaten what I do will let it settle itself - The King

[Chorus] x2
Ain't nobody really gonna care about 'em in the end
And they gonna fall and stumble, I'll be laughing off my fucking head
And you can all be taking 'bout the bullshit they be feeding you
But come back when you realise that they lying and you need the truth

[Verse 3]
I give my life away, you say I hide away
You say I said I never said I said I mightin' make it
Through the fame and the problems with my brain
Mixing Xannies with Cocaine
Thinking everything's ok
I gotta kinda different outlook
I'm doing this for proud crooks
There's some things you wouldn't touch on
With holding anger, got you feeling like a punch on
'Member when they said I wouldn't be nothing
And the cops would see the crew and the dogs would just cuff 'em
With me too off course, spitting in a piggy wagon
Didn't really give a fuck, I was spitting at 'em
The industry wouldn't really see my point of view
If I send a maniac with a gat and point at you
We raised different, my brain lifted
Insane, twisted, then the games shifted

[Chorus] x2
Ain't nobody really gonna care about 'em in the end
And they gonna fall and stumble, I'll be laughing off my fucking head
And you can all be taking 'bout the bullshit they be feeding you
But come back when you realise that they lying and you need the truth

[Outro]
The truth, the truth is right here
In a scene surrounded by bullshit
We remain at the top, stay real
And that's why we stand out
You're over there doing your thing
And we're thinking you're a suss cunt
We're laughing at ya
King!
Yo Nebs - we done it again!
Fucking morons, fucking idiots
