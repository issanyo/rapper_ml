[Verse 1: Fortay & Kerser]
Started bummy, dirty, maxis jumpin' fuckin' taxis
Just to bust the studios, couple grams in a saddy
Was a dream, rappin', what I seen, had no option B
On the street, doin' what I had to 'cause I gotta eat
No need to stop the beat, what, have they forgotten me?
The skinny cunt they used to laugh at, need my pockets deep
But I was scrapin' up, never knew 'bout makin' bucks
Sippin' on a drink, no ride then I would take the bus
Blazin' pipe, gettin' drunk, highest spitin' flows
Didn't know as kids, went from [?] to headin' shows
Sellin' sticks to sellin' this, losin' faith and havin' hope
Of stackin' dough instead of sacks of smoke. Now we on the road
In the state, I've turned this shit into a business, mate
Gettin' paid while critics say "better this than flippin' Wayne"
Different place, every weekend, peakin' off my face
Caught up in the music, better that than by the coppers, ayy
Top the charts, I did my thing, I'm back up in the booth
[?] second album track [?]
Set the sound for the scene, we had the streets buzzin'
Seems enough from puffin' weed with stars "is this a dream or something?"

[Hook: Kerser]
It's been too long, we were runnin' to the big dream
And when we found it, it was nothin' like we did think
Friends turn, rappers act, this the slimy game
And when we leave, guarantee they never find the same
It's been too long, we were runnin' to the big dream
And when we found it, it was nothin' like we did think
Friends turn, rappers act, this the slimy game
And when we leave, guarantee they never find the same

[Verse 2: Kerser & Fortay]
'Cause I'm sittin' at the top, they think the view is great
I started makin' money then started losin' mates
A few snakes along the way, spot the true from fake
Gave this everything we got and still refuse to break
I went from battlin' to up in Channel Ten
From takin' mug shots to havin' cameramen
From bustin' shots to doin' shoots upon the movie set
Through the stress, rep the west, on my feet, can't lose a step
The fucking truest yet, what, you cunts forgot?
We done a lot and we still be sittin' at the top
Rap scene was a dream, seein' drama come from cash and [?]
While fiends smokin' meth, it ain't all it's cracked out to be
Sounds easy but it's tougher than you'll ever know
They love it when you're broke but hate you gettin' dough
Started hungry, bummy, no money, could've been a junkie
But I beat the obstacles and never found broke bein' funny
Went from spittin' those, tryna flip my [?] money
To out doin' shows, tourin' the whole country
Seen too many come and go, I never thought I'd earn a grand
Rappin' made it happen, never victims to our circumstance

[Hook: Kerser]
It's been too long, we were runnin' to the big dream
And when we did, it was nothin' like we did think
Friends turn, rappers act, this the slimy game
And when we leave, guarantee they never find the same
It's been too long, we were runnin' to the big dream
And when we did, it was nothin' like we did think
Friends turn, rappers act, this the slimy game
And when we leave, guarantee they never find the same
It's been too long, we were runnin' to the big dream
Friends turn, rappers act, this the slimy game
It's been too long, we were runnin' to the big dream
Friends turn, rappers act, this the slimy game
It's been too long, we was headin' to the big dream
And when we found it, it was nothin' like we did think
Friends turn, rappers act, this the slimy game
And when we leave, guarantee they never find the same
It's been too long, we was headin' to the big dream
And when we found it, it was nothin' like we did think
Friends turn, rappers act, this the slimy game
And when we leave, guarantee they never find the same
