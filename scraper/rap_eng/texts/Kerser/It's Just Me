[Intro:]
It's just me, it's just me, it's Kerser
(Sounds like there's heaps of u cunts)

[Verse 1:]
Think you know the Kers, you don't know shit though
We looking out completely different looking windows
Understand why you hate me dude, if i was you and you was Me I'd probably hate me too
Getting paid, ain't it mad, I'ma chill with the stash
Spend cash drop an album watch the cash come back
Its that easy plus I'm hitting the road heaps
I'm getting paid even more 'cause I don't sleep
So take a photo here cheers call it Kers proud
'Im getting high 'cause I'm about to buy my first house
Rest in peace and hater suck a fat dick
I'm just starting by the end ill show you mad rich
South west oh yes from the underground
Fuck the rap so long I think I'm coming out
So give me space I got shit to do
First thing I'm gonna do is put a hit on you

[Hook:]
See me with a smile high living my life
Tell em I said goodbye tell em die-die
They fucked up when they got me paid
Ain't my fault I ain't make em drop the name, aye
See me with a smile high living my life
Tell em I said goodbye tell em die-die
They fucked up when they got me paid
Ain't my fault I ain't make em drop the name, aye

[Verse 2:]
I wanna see these rappers fucking stomp to bits
While little kids even join, throwing rocks and sticks, shit
You fucking buying what they saying like they so high
But they've been sheltered there whole time they wouldn't know life
Come in the mind of a real cunt
Compared to them i got a pair of fucking steel nuts
Step up, who's fucking tonight
I'm confident if you had that you might have something in life
But you don't so you stay in front of keyboards
Hit caps when your angry that's heaps raw
We ever catch you faggots out on the street
And you don't say what you type then you'll probably be
In the back of a boot tied up with an apple core in your mouth
And where saying that you have to talk
Your mum will I'm like speak up quick
But you can't 'cause the core plus your deep in a ditch, bitch

[Hook:]
See me with a smile high living my life
Tell em I said goodbye tell em die-die
They fucked up when they got me paid
Ain't my fault I ain't make em drop the name, aye
See me with a smile high living my life
Tell em I said goodbye tell em die-die
They fucked up when they got me paid
Ain't my fault I ain't make em drop the name, aye

[Verse 3:]
Get me back up, back up on the raw shit
I fuck the rap none stop I got a sore dick
But its worth it 'cause I'm only getting more rich
So bring the music I'ma rest it on my balls bitch
Rappers talk shit I like to talk facts
You hit the ground then you treat it like my door mat
Fucking rappers these days got no skill
In a battle there's not one I won't kill
Uh yeah they hating that
When I talk it up but they never say it back
Tell your fucking whole crew that I'm calling them wack cunts
If they call me wack ask 'em why I'm so cashed up
Uh, they fucking went quiet
They can't explain why so many people buy it
Dumb cunt fucking use your head
If you were good, they fucking would've bought you instead, shit

[Hook:]
See me with a smile high living my life
Tell em I said goodbye tell em die-die
They fucked up when they got me paid
Ain't my fault I ain't make em drop the name, aye
See me with a smile high living my life
Tell em I said goodbye tell em die-die
They fucked up when they got me paid
Ain't my fault I ain't make em drop the name, aye
