How we fucking got here yeah they see it as a miracle
They tried to stop the movement
But my hands stayed on the steering wheel
I’m too strong and the message that my raps sing
Can stop your mate from suicide
And hold your world from collpasing
Good mates can turn against you on the fucking streets
Specially once you get shine for rhyming over fucking beats
Most the scenes are just fake others are a bunch of geeks
Controlled by what their told to do
On strings like they some puppet shit

Then you come to me you found a breathe of fresh air
In a fresh pair bunch of haters tryna get square
They can get got probably gonna get shot
If they make it personal and say they gonna get Scott
Got stabbed for acting hard over a blood size
From then in life I realized there’s no point in being up tight
We was young then think we just hit puberty
If you think I’m dumb you blaming me I blame the truancy
So what a true emcee talking bout the rainbows
How they writing really dope they softer then some play dough

That’s why I watch you rap till my crew is a laughing stock
You think this shit is fake I fucking beg your pardon gronk
What happenede to the love I guess is slowly changed to hate
While i made it out the rut now, it’s time to grab my mates
Will we live to see a better day I suppose you never know
My worst mistake was letting people know that I be getting dough
I just had to brag cause I fucking proved them wrong
You feel the goose bumps rising you ain't never heard a truer song
You want a piece of pudding but i sat in the cake
You see real when you look at me like the stats on my face
And then everyones sketching over metal detectors
Got em dacked its my show so they let em in get ya

Back to the facts that we living it raw
Middle fingers to the haters this the beggining of more
More raps more shows more tracks more dough
More cash more flows more has more smoke
I’m sticking to the music you just me do my thing
If its win or loose you fucking had to knew I win
Now I’m moving in to grounds I said id never touch
They ask me how to make I just say its effort bruhz
There’s something real about me seperates me from the others
Half our shows on stage I swear to god we spot the under covers
I throw my finger up then pump unwritten letter
Kinda crazy every song that I be getting better
The new albums coming so so phat
Picture that shit if this was just a promo track its kerse one
