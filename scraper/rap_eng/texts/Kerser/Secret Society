[Intro]
Yeah
Let me take you to my past for a second
Look

[Verse 1]
I thought everything was sweet, it was only nine o’clock
In the morning got a warning, copped a caution from a cop
Walking down the street with a spliff in the lip
Ridiculous copped the fine for the littlest bit
Like a tenner, I'm away, I keep walking dare I say
I popped a annyxay and ate a massive plate of anyways
So it's half past nine now I’m copping a call
On my phone from a mate and I’m not even sure
Who it is, 'cause I’m smashed I'ma sit have a chat
This that, sick lad gotta jet hit me back
I move along I heard the dealer got done
By like four different cunts with a kill on the run
Now I’m thinking okay so I can’t get blazed
And I ain't got a cent, now I’m in a desperate way
This all before the fame so I’m boarding a train
Bomb the floor with the paint, had a brawl copped a blade
Got away, okay with a scar on my cheek
'Cause every day in the past so I’m beginning to creep
Around your house or the shop and I’m robbing the place
I ain't wanna be a bum so I gotta get paid
Life of a struggler, drugs couldn’t hustle nah
I'll get a batch then it's gone without a customer
The shit shit changed once I hit the booth
Let me tell ya now days so sick it's true

[Interlude 1]
So what, After that the shit changed man
Fuck bro.. you ain't heard fucking hell let me
Tell you about it.. ready?

[Verse 2]
I woke up about half past nine
I had a rather big night, felt like half of it right
But these days every hand i shake they giving me
E’s, Coke, Weed and base
So everything new 'cause I’m getting the pay right
News shoes, clothes, car heard from the grape vine
I'm on the verge of illuminisation, wait forget that I was told not to say shit
Couple grand blown in the pokie machine
I didn’t even get to play it I was smoking the green
They went to kick me out and seen the “Kers” on my face
They pat me back, gave me double started turning away
And also these days bitches hanging to fuck
There's like fifty million of em fucking praying for nuts
Are these bitches dumb they ain't heard about my girl?
They can go find a wanna be 'cause I’m loyal
Getting big money almost every day
YouTube on its own got me staring at pay
Not including merch, shows, CDs or iTunes
Spending money quick come see how I do

[Interlude 2]
So what's with all this talk of the secret society?
Woah, woah, what? Shut the fuck up man, what the fuck's that shit?

[Verse 3]
I woke up now about seven o’clock
Nice and early in a suit, 'cause of the message I got
Two fellas one was [?] and the other was [?]
Kinda weird 'cause I ain't ever heard of them and dem
And then they talk a lot of business in the shit that I got
I thought fuck it man I’ll meet em go and give it a shot
Met em at the place, the shit was place a palace
They flew another three business peeps out of Dallas
Got to talking and I ain't saying to much
But I can say for now I'll be caking in bucks
Sign the paper then I leave, like they owning me now
I know you probably thinking but they owning you how?
I can’t say to much when I’m writing this rhyme
'Cause this verse right here put my life on the line
But you can come to my house illuminate in the sunshine
How many heads can I fly with a punch line?
Made a little deal I can get my mates
So I mention a bit about to Nebs and Rates
Nebs was like what the fuck man I heard of that shit
Rates agreed fucking oath go and work with it quick
So they on the verge of joining, wait I ain't really mean that
Ratesy got a beamer lined up you should see lad
Nebs cut me there I think i did screw up
Bruz you told everybody way to much cut
