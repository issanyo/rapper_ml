Love is a battlefield

[Verse 1]
This is the final straw, yeah, he's high for sure
He's gone to buy some more, stay up from night to dawn
And they always fight, they at it all the time
But, this time, something's changing, yeah it's different tonight
She sick of living her life, she plans to get up and run away
With her kids and just live in another state
They struggle now just to feed 'cause they're poor
Where the kids playing raw, he's leaving needles on floor
He's raging bad like "don't look at me bitch"
You go cook for the kids or cop a hook to the chin
And it wouldn't be the first, he's always smacking her up
They were deeply in love, but now he's smacking it up
His vain first priority then the kids probably
She knows this shit is going to be a hard move but honestly
She's got to go he needs his drugs and he has to steal
Escape it all 'cause his love is a battlefield

[Verse 2]
First night without a dime in her purse
They have nowhere to go, she has to find a reserve
But she feels better with her kids by her side
And the known fact you'll never injure her right
Well, she feels freedom but she's hungry at the same time
Stress is on her mind, her kids are sickened, all night they cry
It ain't right 'cause back home he wakes up
Loads his shotty, wants revenge so he scrapes up
Enough dollars to be catching a bus
To the first place they ever met but he must
Hold it all together or he ending it forever
Never see his kid and never find connection any better
But they're long gone it was the same reserve
Her sister rang her up and said you're staying with her
So he's back roaming on the search for his next hit
He's been through the best shit is mind state is hectic

[Verse 3]
She's living life, it's been a week and the kids' laughter
Happy at last not like a back at the start
But he's got tracks on his arms still tracking them down
He don't want to make it right he wants to smack her on down
Put a gat in her mouth like what look what you've done
He's sipping on bottles of rum over what has become
But he needs a hit to escape all his brain's thoughts
It only been four hours and he's hit like more than eight wroughts
Cashed up, pays a visit to his dealer
Pays his tick and gets some more it can't get any realer
She's long gone he's in love with a ghost
Might be dead to him so he doubles his dose
Eyes roll back, can't talk can't move
See her face move then his kids too
Out cold heart stops head falls
Love is a battlefield and that's what he's dead for
