[Verse 1:]
This is Scott, Kers, let me have the verse
You always hog the spotlight, you forgot that I grab the words
You ain't really that cunt, thinking that you mad fuck
You still the same chap smoking cones, you wouldn't have lunch
But oh the fame, how it's playing with your brain
You're rhyming single syllables and everything is lame
What happened to the passion in the rapping in your actions
Lately make me think your crazy lazy, thinking like your knacked
And it's sad you, bombed yourself with tattoos
Think you're in a bad crew, look at you, you sad move
Let me have my life back, I stab myself like die rap
Kerser on your face, the ink got placed, we'll never dry that
Right there was a scream for help
And every track you drop, you saying that you're being yourself
You're a fucking liar addict, pop a pill you isn't magic
Kind of tragic, your obsession being fresh
You're just a maggot
I don't want your fucking car, your fucking shoes, the fucking whole lot
Let me take my brain and have my life back as the old Scott
You're a fucking fame whore, run away in pain or
Go and jump on stage raw, have another eight more
Of them Xannies your anxiety's pathetic
And your writing ain't a message, 'cause you're finding you'll regret it
But it's our sercet and it's burning you admit it
You fucking junkie pull your head in, call yourself the sickest dickhead

[Interlude:]
Ha ha ha
It's Kerser, the sickest
Ahh, I think Scott's tripping out a bit
I'll break it down, this is the truth

[Verse 2:]
It's Kers one, the fucking miracle from birth
And Scottie getting angry 'cause he's fearing all the work
Think about it Scott, you could barely hold a job
And I made the rapping happen, now you're feeling like you're lost
You fucking took a backseat, I went and rang the baller
State to state, I'm working late of course I'm going to score drugs
Without the Kers, you'd still be in the fucking gutter
Bludging off your mother, even taking money from your younger brother
You hate the arrogance, it took you as a shock too
Don't let these people, try to tell you that I'm not you
I represent the struggle, you're the drug you couldn't hustle
I'm your only fucking talent, shit I hate to burst your bubble
Imagine life without me, you wouldn't have a house g
I threw the g in there to match that single syllable ouchie
Come an took it over now, you fucking schizophrenic
Remember when you made a prayer to God about me that's pathetic
And fucking oath I pop pills, I roll blunts, I got bills
But they all pay 'cause Kerser took control so what is Scott still?
The one to make it better, you're a fucking joke admit it
Kerser one I'm signing out ill end with the sickest dickhead

[Chorus:]
So which one am I? Should I choose to end it all?
Call a mate? I mean ain't that what all your friends are for?
I'm fucking so lost, I don't know what's what
Day by day, I live for Kers, I'm feeling like now Scott's lost
But this is Scott right or just scared of the spotlight
Living like he's living, every day I'm feeling Scott hides
But that's it i mean its sure to hurt
Kind of making sense why they fucking call you Kers, reverse
