[Intro]
Let me explain something
Kerser
Kerser
Kerser is sick!

[Verse 1:]
What it is, it's the man of the moment
And any other moment that they claiming I own it
Kerser flavour, yeah I sprinkle on top
They hanging like a junkie needs a hit, I'll sprinkle a lot
So good with rap, no looking back
Shit there beef gets wrapped like cooked kebabs
I'ma light this spliff, you can ride this dick
I get the flu, people hang around to try and get sick
It ain't likely kid, I was born with this
This is bad for your brain, there's your warning bitch
As I pour a mix and chop fourteen sticks
That's a half oz here like my family mix, ya dig?
If not, fuck off, you must stop
I'll take you to the top, fucking oath so you can jump off
No more games, shit you know me by now
And if ya haven't heard ya best to know I'm owning the town, bitch

[Hook:]
Put 'em up, raise 'em up, we gon' get high
Yes I demand that I'm the best I
Will never stop 'till they murder me, shit
You should have fucking knew it bitch, Kerser is sick
Put 'em up, raise 'em up, we gon' get high
Yes I demand that I'm the best I
Will never stop 'till they murder me, shit
You should have fucking knew it bitch, Kerser is sick

[Verse 2]
I walked in, kicked the door like "hold up, nah wait wait"
I used that last time, let me set it straight mate
The sickest is back, ridiculous rap
Hold the fingers like that and hurt your missus's flaps
They asking 'bout me, where's he going, is he singed, no
You giving me a contract and you think I'm gonna sign, no
I did it myself, I wanna keep it that way
Pile up the ashcay and waste it on a mad day
The way I'm living man they pay me to bounce
While my fans sing my shit, they gotta say it out loud
You can find me at the club, rubber band around the notes
Who said I never made shit? I gotta jam it down their throats
Certainly the sickest, got me hurting all you bitches
Then they turn on me for instance cause I'm burning all their lyrics
Hit me back, come and see me on my death bed
With a zombie bitch getting head, dead set

[Hook:]
Put 'em up, raise 'em up, we gon' get high
Yes I demand that I'm the best I
Will never stop 'till they murder me, shit
You should have fucking knew it bitch, Kerser is sick
Put 'em up, raise 'em up, we gon' get high
Yes I demand that I'm the best I
Will never stop 'till they murder me, shit
You should have fucking knew it bitch, Kerser is sick

[Verse 3:]
Come and cruise with me and you will see lad
I'm the man and that's why I don't listen to their feedback
Hear that, feedback, lyrics here, read that
You's all make me sick, gonna make me bring my feed back
Come close, you can witness a man, talk tough
Now you're here, you got shit in your pants
I'm the freshest motherfucker that you've seen for days
Now I'm paid, eshay, now the green is blazed
Dark red eyes, yeah that's normal for me
And the rest of the boys, ain't it awful to see?
Do you think we give a fuck, you know the answer to that
I'm so sick motherfucker yeah the cancer is rap
I live fast probably die young, celebrate my life cunts
Make sure when they bury me they puttin' in some nice buds
Rise up and fight for a better way
Always off my guts and I can not remember yesterday

[Hook:]
Put 'em up, raise 'em up, we gon' get high
Yes I demand that I'm the best I
Will never stop 'till they murder me, shit
You should have fucking knew it bitch, Kerser is sick

[Outro:]
Now, Kerser, we gon' get high, fucking killed it again Nebs
You already know what it is, Kerser is sick
Sickest, Sickest (Kerser ain't no joke)
Ain't gon' tell these motherfuckers again, man
Kerser is sick!
Ain't gon' tell these motherfuckers again, man
Kerser is sick!
Blast your face and kick your teeth in
Remember that?
I told you man! I told you!
K-K-K-K-Kerser is sick!
No but you wouldn't listen
Why? You stupid fuck, look at you now
