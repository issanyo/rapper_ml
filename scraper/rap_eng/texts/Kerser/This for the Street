[Verse 1:]
Kers one I ain't down with the rap scene
I just proved I’m a motherfucking cash machine
Did everything I said I’d do plus more
One call could have your bitch at my front door
Last album at the scene like no shit
And add a world to my bank, I’ma go get
Everything I can and I’ll bring the crew too
A bunch of crazy cunts, now tell me who to shoot, woo
We have fun with all the dead set shit, bitch
Don’t get it twisted you could end up dead quick
I came a long way, you should see the new whip
And my house, you’d probably want to move in
Aus rap got it locked, I’m the main man
Six years at the top and I’ve stayed there
You cunts using rocks like a caveman
Your bitch want me on her body like a spray tan

[Hook:]
This for the street, for the ways that you made me
This for gang members that they called crazy
This the bomb, this the shit that you wait on
This is Kers, guarantee I always stay strong
This for the street, for the ways that you made me
This for gang members that they called crazy
This the bomb, this the shit that you wait on
This is Kers, guarantee I always stay strong

[Verse 2:]
Rocking gold in the club I’m performing in
Want the check before I even start walking in
No one else hustle rap like the Kers do
Got my foot in, getting money was the first move
I admitted I was broke when I was, bruz
But now I’m cashed so of course I hold my wads up
Get a load of me, I’m a fucking superstar
And rappers hate because no one knows who you are
Rolling deep in my range and the crew ready
No cameras here ‘cause they wanted and they do the damage
King Kers, ABK, what you know about
If you sent your demo, sorry bro I throw ‘em out
I’m a beast when it come to the rap shit
No talking heads or tails, come and watch some cash flip
The lads sick in the booth and It’s crazy
Shout out to C-Town, I loved how you raised me

[Hook:]
This for the street, for the ways that you made me
This for gang members that they called crazy
This the bomb, this the shit that you wait on
This is Kers, guarantee I always stay strong
This for the street, for the ways that you made me
This for gang members that they called crazy
This the bomb, this the shit that you wait on
This is Kers, guarantee I always stay strong

[Verse 3:]
Know the Kers, I’m the man with this
Send you home from my gig in the ambulance
Or in some bandages, ‘cause I can’t stand your shit
And it hurts your pride, ‘cause you’re a fan of this
And I dismantle shit with the candle tip
And try to make the shit sharp and hit your man with this
ABK, bitch, so you’ve heard of us
The realest rapper 'round, yeah we serve it up, cunt

[Hook:]
This for the street, for the ways that you made me
This for gang members that they called crazy
This the bomb, this the shit that you wait on
This is Kers, guarantee I always stay strong
This for the street, for the ways that you made me
This for gang members that they called crazy
This the bomb, this the shit that you wait on
This is Kers, guarantee I always stay strong
