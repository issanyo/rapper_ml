[Hook:]
We are on some shit and I don’t know if I can move right now
Looking for another rhyme, I know I’m lost in music how?
Did this happen? Wasn’t meant to make it, but I fucking did
And I had no help so that makes you much more in love with this

[Verse 1:]
Dropping all these bombs bitch
Ask around 'cause I'm on this
Summer time my hot bitch
Wonder why you ain’t got this
Crowd jump around in the mosh pit
All bitches wanna lock lips
Town come out wanna watch this
Key to the city, I’m the locksmith
Claim to have it all, you ain’t got shit
You want what I got, but it’s Scott’s cheers
Crew got it all with the top kids
Rocking all the hot shit
Catch a glimpse at my watch, tick
Gucci hood, you can wash this
Left the hood cause I got rich
Still go back, cause I’m not bitch
In the ghetto with, Walsh shit
Purple drink we are off tits
Ain’t no one gonna stop this
Chosen one, I am god’s gift
Got famous then I got scripts
Who to blame me or doctors?
Depend what way the plot twist
Catch me out in a hot whip
Kers with a little bit of Scott mix
Crawling ‘round cause I pop trips
Aliens they were not sick
And my engineer's like what shit
Never mind I’m on this
Shit they call the chronic
Plus the pills I popped it
Here’s a hook, let's stop quick

[Hook:]
We are on some shit and I don’t know if i can move right now
Looking for another rhyme, I know I’m lost in music how?
Did this happen? Wasn’t meant to make it, but I fucking did
And I had no help so that makes you much more in love with this

[Verse 2:]
Rocking ‘round in new stuff
ABK’s the crew bruz
Roll with a couple shooters
Rather beat you down your crews fucked
Do the same shit every two months
Now you thinking shit this too much
Cause your legs are broken bruised up
And you’re walking 'round with two crutch, shit
Let’s leave it there, that’s too suss
Ain’t too many that can move us
I’m just giving you the truth bruz
Don’t wanna listen I got two nuts
On your girl cause I couldn’t give two fucks
If she died right now I’d boo slut
Jump in a car and cruise brah
Then send you a letter “you a loser”
Catch me out in a new car
Driving right past your Uber
Yelling out the window “you’re too smart”
Now fucking better duck cause we shoot cars
Couldn’t give a fuck if they move brah
Other rappers look like food fuck
What I meant to do? Make food of ya?
And end your career with a few bars
Speaking of that, I popped two bars
I’m always looking for a new buzz
Whether I don’t or do drugs
The answer is um move cunt
Every album I move up
Saying that you rich, you got two bucks?
Feeling kinda sick, gonna spew up
End the verse here cos I'm too fucked

[Hook:]
We are on some shit and I don’t know if i can move right now

[Outro:]
In love with this, rugged shit
Tell the radio to suck a dick
Heard of the Kers? Yeah I know you have
Eyes so red I’m a stoner lad
Top of the game, you know the name
You hate so much, and know your pain
Good smile on my face like everyday
225 repping ABK
