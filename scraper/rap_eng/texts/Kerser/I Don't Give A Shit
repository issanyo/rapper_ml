[Chorus]
I don’t give a shit what you do on a track
Kerser and Sarm make you move right back
I don’t give a fuck if you think you’re the best
What we’re spittin' caving in your whole chest
I don’t give a shit what you do on a track
Kerser and Sarm make you move right back
I don’t give a fuck if you think you’re the best
What we’re spitting caving in your whole chest

[Verse 1: Sarm]
Oi bruz, better move better shut up
What I spit here will make your team suffer
Screamin’ out he’s a nut-nut-nutter
Call me Jamie Oliver FUCK FUCK FUCKER
I get naked, your girlfriends love a
Chef shit, cook it up lets shucka
Hungry as hell, after my tucka
Steppin to me? You’ll be mute like plucka
Get ready for Kerser and Sarm
Emerge from a bar, straight merkin the young
Get hurt in the bum, 'cause you’re thirsty for cum
To me it only exists like SERS IN A RUN
See that, never cause a commotion
Like a black bear, forced in the ocean
I’m a tag rare, forced in the moment
You’re a black kwair, snorting the lotion
You get kicked, hit, thrown aside
When we spit shit, stonerfied
Get ripped bitch, open wide
For a quick kid, motorbike
Don’t ever try step to the best
You’ll get left in a mess, like feds in a dress
Faggots! We’ll leave you stressed and depressed
Kerser and Sarm the best mess to ingest

[Chorus]
I don’t give a shit what you do on a track
Kerser and Sarm make you move right back
I don’t give a fuck if you think you’re the best
What we’re spitting caving in your whole chest
I don’t give a shit what you do on a track
Kerser and Sarm make you move right back
I don’t give a fuck if you think you’re the best
What we’re spitting caving in your whole chest

[Verse 2: Kerser]
I don’t give a shit what you do on a track
'Cause you’re doing an act while you’re doing it lad
It seems so sad and lame to me that I wait eight hours patiently
Settin up a bomb right under the deck, then you hit the stage
No set
Cunts in your back bro equals your front row
Only got one row, now they’re all fucked bro
Fucked up and they’re leaving with earns
Leaving the Earth, how evil is Kers?
Half these cunts never been on the street
But they speak like they be on the beat with the heat
Why you wanna talk about shit that you never done?
Say you pulling triggers but you couldn't even get a gun
Get 'em son, yeah, you emptied a full clip?
No you didn’t. Never have, don’t bullshit
Kers one, you can mark my words
I’ll make you fucking listen when I start a verse
Your shit's whack, its piss weak to me
I could probably get you killed for a 50 a week
And I listen to the, shit that you say
I can tell that you tryna be fifty today
But Kers and Sarm, yeah Sarm and Kers
Time to shine


[Chorus]
I don’t give a shit what you do on a track
Kerser and Sarm make you move right back
I don’t give a fuck if you think you’re the best
What we’re spitting caving in your whole chest
I don’t give a shit what you do on a track
Kerser and Sarm make you move right back
I don’t give a fuck if you think you’re the best
What we’re spitting caving in your whole ch-
I don’t give a shit what you do on a track
Kerser and Sarm make you move right back
I don’t give a fuck if you think you’re the best
What we’re spitting caving in your whole chest
I don’t give a shit what you do on a track
Kerser and Sarm make you move right back
I don’t give a fuck if you think you’re the best
What we’re spitting caving in your whole ch-
