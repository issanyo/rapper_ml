Yeah

[Verse 1]
Be the one to say it but they left it to me
Like ain't no one gonna speak up on the edge of your seat
And you wanna see me fail, see me fall, throw it all
But I spit so legit, under skin I make 'em crawl
Like I never knew right from wrong; fighting on
Headspace, they tell me keep on writing songs
I picked a vibe like a move wonder why it can move
Try to hide from the truth my eyes looking bruised
Cos I'm so smashed, triple what I wrote lad
Sitting 'round a bowl, big buds watching smoke grab anything in sight
I'm your medicine you died
Kerser only thing that make you ever feel alive
They look at me like "Man you at the top, there's no stress"
I'm just cheering that my boys are on there home stretch
Always stayed loyal you can check on that
I respect the fucking crew, they respect me back
Dissing's gonna have you all depressed and bashed
And I won't give you fame I won't mention that
Loyal cunts on my team they will delete you from the scene
Ain't gonna dwell further cause you know what I mean
Rates got these rappers fucking shittin' their pants
They should thank me I tell Rates to give 'em a chance
I tell the crew "Just chill" and I'm only being real
They don't like most you rappers, they wanna make your blood spill
That's competitive mix with how we grow up
That's why my attitude's never giving no fucks
Rappers actin' different when in front of the mics
Kinda like fucking haters when they starting to type
Repeat what you rapped about 'Now you got no beef'
They drop their nuts and cry and you thinking 'They so street'
Everyday thoughts I'm just airing them out
You made me arrogant, here you can stare at the ground
The 225 has split out left divers
Bitch out you find the sick sound I might just
Drop another album to restore your fate
Like I didn't pay my dues when you saw me wait
Waiting' 'round the same time as the highest man
It set something off like I had the tightest plan
Execute perfect, top charts I worked it, pop stars got murdered, drop bars like Kerser
I made a blueprint, the greediest shit that Kers does
I designed it, so it's only gonna work once
Laughing in your face now I'm one of a kind
You backstabbed me, get a real one in your spine
Attitude's troublesome, same as my brothers damn
Crawl into your mind and take our brain to another land
We out here, this is real as it gets
What you think we gonna fold if we dealing with threats?
FUCK THAT!
