[Verse 1:]
There's only one Kerser ever ever will be,
Rap sick with a style so clean that its filthy
None of them can kill me, riding in the ill beast
Whopped on its arse thought you said you couldn't steal these
But we crucify a beat with the same plates
Spinning out the bitches as we pull up to a mate's place
What you know about the streets and the ram raids
Lads are getting hungry for the money, need the damn pay
Me? I'm a rapper though one of you make dough
Run with crew ayo, everything's OK though
Sick with it brah, you can't deny I'm mad fresh
I'm Colgate with Tic Tac, you running with that bad breath
Couldn't match my style, I'm too over the top
They download your shit, for me they go to the shops
I'm so confident, 'cause I got ears too
I can hear myself rap I know I'm the fucking shit true

[Hook:]
Stand up, come and mark your place
Never fall down, never find a darker space
If they here for the night let 'em ride for free
Get the pipes lit, let 'em come and ride with me
Stand up, come and mark your place
Never fall down, never find a darker space
If they here for the night let 'em ride for free
Get the pipes lit, let 'em come and ride with me

[Verse 2:]
Haters talk but they never be a real threat
Real debt, go and get a loan and get me killed yep
Heard it all before, you just a dumb fuck
You wouldn't pull the trigger, why the fuck you got a gun tucked?
All bark, no bite, me bark, go bite
Fellas do it for me, I ain't even have to go right
Real rap Sydney, the South West kid be
Lifting shit, upper level when I spit, see
Another ten sides of me that you probably gon' try to be
But you couldn't get high as me so why you even fight with me?
Never made sense, never get a HSC
'Cause I'm patiently, wait for pay and
Tell me how a man, who couldn't make grade ten
Lives off the words, tell me why I need a grade then
Fucking A, now fucking B-K
Get 'em up high, let em know we the team ay

[Hook:]
Stand up, come and mark your place
Never fall down, never find a darker space
If they here for the night let 'em ride for free
Get the pipes lit, let 'em come and ride with me
Stand up, come and mark your place
Never fall down, never find a darker space
If they here for the night let 'em ride for free
Get the pipes lit, let 'em come and ride with me

[Bridge:]
Don't talk just know your roll
So Kers but I still gotta owe my soul
If you in for the life come and sign away
Need some time away, I need to hibernate, damn
Don't talk just know your roll
So Kers but I still gotta owe my soul
If you in for the life come and sign away
Need some time away, I need to hibernate, damn

[Hook:]
Stand up, come and mark your place
Never fall down, never find a darker space
If they here for the night let 'em ride for free
Get the pipes lit, let 'em come and ride with me
Stand up, come and mark your place
Never fall down, never find a darker space
If they here for the night let 'em ride for free
Get the pipes lit, let 'em come and ride with me
