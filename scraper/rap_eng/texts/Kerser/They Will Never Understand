[Intro:]
Yeah, just gonna let it all out on this one
Its not all fun and games
This is peoples lives
This is my life

[Verse 1:]
See me happy man? Thats a fake smile
I got a lot on my plate this might take a while
Take a seat turn your brain off and listen up
And maybe by the end you'll know why I don't give a fuck
We was living in hell, I thought of killing myself
Got boys sitting in cells, I try to spit cause it helps
Plus my dads sick my life is getting drastic
And magazines had to hide to ask me "What's this lad shit?"
I give a fuck about a trend or an adlay
I only dress like this just to show you I have pay
Cause I ain't used to that I used to be a putrid chat
And ain't no way will you ever find me moving back
I'm proving facts that I'm nice on the beat
I like to take away the lives of people ice on the street
Cause I've seen it ruin lives, breaking families to bits
And don't you call that shit soft, come and handle how we live kid

[Hook:]
Its all out and its going around
Its the only reason why I put the bottle down
They will never understand, I'm the way that I am
Until they do I guess Im gonna have to say it again
I try, fly by, but my mind is side swiped
At night night, I fight fight and bye bye
I try hard but I can't escape
I'm so real, too real, nah I can't be fake

[Verse 2:]
That addiction is yours, dont inflict it on others
Your mistake now are you listening fucker
I ain't need to see the whole crew fucked up
This shit be spreading like a plague and people see but shut up
You need to speak about the evil you see
But no one wanna do that fuck it leave it to me
My older brother in rehab I should be by his side
But I ain't got the guts, he's stronger I will do it in time
Hah, do it in time, thats all I ever tell myself
Cause if I put it off that means today I can just do myself
And doin me that ain't something that you wanna be
Without the rhymes I'm nothing just a loser now I gotta see
The truth hurts, so this album took the life of me
I'm just me it's fucked its nothing I even try and be
When I say I'm real dont think that Im talking tough
I mean that I'm real and I am just a fuck up

[Hook:]
Its all out and its going around
Its the only reason why I put the bottle down
They will never understand, Im the way that I am
Until they do I guess I'm gonna have to say it again
I try, fly by, but my mind is side swiped
At night night, I fight fight and bye bye
I try hard but I can't escape
I'm so real, too real, nah I can't be fake

[Verse 3:]
At the moment its the truth I'mma speak it
Tell the truth Im too scared to release it
That kinda contradicts my other tracks I do know
Call me a liar I ain't know what to do bro
Never happy deep down I'm fucked up
Bud puffed, drugs tucked, left side, lung crushed
Thats enough to make me quit right there
You would think so but to quit I swear
I would have to change my life and get the fuck away
Tomorrow ain't exciting man its just another fucking day
I'm skin and bones, Im a motherfucking wreck shit
I meant to let 'em know that I will never tread quick
Cause I'm scared I ain't feeling like I'm better yet
I'm walking slow and its getting worse with every step
I run away and meet the front of a train
The side covered in stains, Im high and nothing remains, nah

[Hook:]
Its all out and its going around
Its the only reason why I put the bottle down
They will never understand, Im the way that I am
Until they do I guess I'm gonna have to say it again
I try, fly by, but my mind is side swiped
At night night, I fight fight and bye bye
I try hard but I can't escape
I'm so real, too real, nah I can't be fake

[Outro:]
Yeah, and I find it ironic
That the higher I get
The lower I'm digging myself in a hole
Its funny that
Yeah come outside aye
But as soon as, as soon as fucking Australian Idol
Fuck me dead, Australian Idol cunt
