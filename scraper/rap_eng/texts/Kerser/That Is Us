[Intro: Kerser & Jay UF]
It's Kerser
I'm with Jay UF
Jay! What?
What's happenin'? I guess you're gonna say "fuck all" again, uh?
Can we just hurry up and do the song? What?
Let's just get the song done mate, come on
I'll go first then. All right, go for it
Yo, Jay's a fuckwit, check, look

[Verse 1]
I'm an OG, probably 'bout to OD
Said it 'round o-three, bet they're gonna clone me
I wasn't wrong, but a bunch that wanna be me
Wanna Be Kers, that should be your next CD
I came up in the game 'round the time when
You wouldn't jump on the internet fightin'
I got a call off a whore. Who? Grimshaw
Nah, another bitch, cracked out a thin whore
Fuck that Jay, I wouldn't hit with your dick
I fuck it back ahead so I face it like a swordfish
Where does all of this sick shit come from?
Kerser would, he did, I mention I got one on
Fresh cunt, I'm lookin' better with age
And I don't write raps, I machete the page
None ahead of me mate and it's weird 'cause I live dreams
Hurry up Jay, I don't wanna hear your sixteens

[Hook: Kerser]
Still runnin' this game in the fast lane
Wavin' at every cunt that we pass mate
Still killin' every show that is us, ayy
Never gonna stop till we delivering our last tape
Still runnin' this game in the fast lane
Wavin' at every cunt that we pass mate
Still killin' every show that is us, ayy
Never gonna stop till we delivering our last tape

[Verse 2: Jay UF]
Crack another drink man, fuck, is this my kind?
I'm takin' over shit like it's a feature on my song
Time's gone like a terrorist with a nice bomb
Blowin' up the scene, not in a way that you guys want
If I was wrong and never made it with my songs
Iâ€™ll make a go fund me so I can still light bongs
Cry night long, whinging, where has my life gone?
Wait a minute Jay, that's what you do when you write songs
Ha, fuckin' ha, yeah, I'm funny like I'm Scott
He looks like Kate Moss if she puffed on the ice lots
There goes the record deal, fuck it, it's my loss
Time to call Cento and I fill up my [?]
Hate rap anyway, it's time to admit it
Fuck, I'll only ever listen if my rhymin' is in it
So, fuck album number two, nah, I'm finally finished
Nah, I'm joking, I'ma spit it just to prine you critics, cunts

[Hook: Kerser]
Still runnin' this game in the fast lane
Wavin' at every cunt that we pass mate
Still killin' every show that is us, ayy
Never gonna stop till we delivering our last tape
Still runnin' this game in the fast lane
Wavin' at every cunt that we pass mate
Still killin' every show that is us, ayy
Never gonna stop till we delivering our last tape

[Verse 3: Jay UF & Kerser]
Hey Kers, I'm thinking fuck a third verse
Let me spit it then! They don't wanna hear the Kers verse
Shut up Jay, you ridiculous cunt
They know Kerser is the sickest, they ain't heard it enough
They ain't heard it enough? Now let's talk about me
The fact that I be credible with the words that I speak
Well, you're a turd and a geek for even turnin' on me
Jay, where's your last album? People burn it for free
Shit, Kers taking shots like you did in our last song
Hope he takes a different kind of shot and his heart stops
Gotta move along cunt, give up, you're past gone
Waitin' on my pay, where you gettin' these cars from?
Shut the fuck up, where you tryin' to get to?
Because I'm number one, what, does it upset you?
We don't really get along, we just dissin' on tracks
Nah, I'm kidding, next album cunt, your shit is just wack

[Hook: Kerser]
Still runnin' this game in the fast lane
Wavin' at every cunt that we pass mate
Still killin' every show that is us, ayy
Never gonna stop till we delivering our last tape
Still runnin' this game in the fast lane
Wavin' at every cunt that we pass mate
Still killin' every show that is us, ayy
Never gonna stop till we delivering our last tape
