[Intro:]
Yeah, it was nice knowing yous all
You won't be seeing me no more
Yo, I'm gone

[Verse 1:]
Outta reach and I feel like I'm gone now
I never had a clue about the right or wrong route
I fucked up but I found the success
How the fuck I do that and still be down in a mess
I'm into skitzing when I'm outta drugs, the evil inside
I'm knowing why the fuck my misses couldn't be by my side
I tuck a knife on my dacks, no one knows that it's there
Sometimes I rub it on my leg so that I know and I swear
This the paranoid street life I'm stuck in the old route
You faggots still had the hide to say that I sold out
Just cause these people know me doesn't mean that I've changed
It means that I done something different and they knowing the name
Sometimes I really wanna get away and never come back
And just run away for good and turn my back on the rap
Then I'm back on the track, and ain't nobody got an answer
They said I was the sickest 'cause the rapping is my cancer

[Hook:]
I'm not knowing who to trust and I'm walking
I turn my back on my life it's important
That you never see me smile again
I throw away the pen again I'm guessing this is the end, I'm gone
I'm not knowing who to trust and I'm walking
I turn my back on my life it's important
That you never see me smile again
I throw away the pen again I'm guessing this is the end, I'm gone

[Verse 2:]
See I gave my life to rap and it gave some cash back
Can I leave it, that's that, cause my mind is a smashed lab
Experiment that went wrong they wanna know my best song
I'm so fucking known but still feel like that I get slept on
Life is like I stepped on a landmine and leapt wrong
Then rolled into another one and now my fucking legs gone
Why they crazy viewing it, I summed it up real
I wish I had some kinda button that would help how I feel
They would never give me props cause I'm repping the street
You don't know what I've popped just to get me to sleep
It's like a never ending cycle, and it's feeling kinda vital
Now they treat me like an idol but I'm cruising with a rifle
And it's pointing at my head as I'm staring down the barrel
Fuck a one minute round, man this is what a battle
And I thank you that your listening but yo I gotta jet quick
About to lose my mind, I guess my life has got too hectic

[Hook:]
I'm not knowing who to trust and I'm walking
I turn my back on my life it's important
That you never see me smile again
I throw away the pen again I'm guessing this is the end, I'm gone
I'm not knowing who to trust and I'm walking
I turn my back on my life it's important
That you never see me smile again
I throw away the pen again I'm guessing this is the end, I'm gone

[Bridge:]
Tell me will you be there when I really need you I'm
Feeling like I need a break, but feeling like you need me I
Never felt this way but I
Think this is my good-bye
Good-night, good-bye, good-life, good-bye
Tell me will you be there when I really need you I'm
Feeling like I need a break, but feeling like you need me I
Never felt this way but I
Think this is my good-bye
Good-night, good-bye, good-life, good-bye

[Hook:]
I'm not knowing who to trust and I'm walking
I turn my back on my life it's important
That you never see me smile again
I throw away the pen again I'm guessing this is the end, I'm gone
I'm not knowing who to trust and I'm walking
I turn my back on my life it's important
That you never see me smile again
I throw away the pen again I'm guessing this is the end, I'm gone

[Outro:]
Good-bye, good-bye
Make sure I get them visits man (Thanks for your support)
Put some money on the jail account (Amazing man)
You won't see Kerser no more (Fuck I don't want letters, I want to actually see you)
I've had it with this shit, I surrender
I'm going
We out, for good this time
Fuck it
And I feel like I'm gone, now
