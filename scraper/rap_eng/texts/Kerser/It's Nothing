[Hook]
Lightin' weed in the hood that I grew up in
Like fuck it man it's nothin'
Fuck all who I trust man
People ask me do I trust them

[Verse]
I can't be fucked see you know me a long time now
I've never stopped to lie down
Racking up a line now
Back stage in a state that I don't know
I do it for the promo, and the fame with the money but you know so
Walk with head phones listen to my own shit
This place I grew up in feeling like my home kid
Empty her
And so many empty purse
Got me walkin' round drunk
Look for trouble it's bizzer
But I guess that's what my day brings, sitting at the bridge I use to fuckin' day dream
The world turns and I'm getting kinda dizzy now
Deep breath and I'm sitting down
Purple in my cup now
Dark purple sit my arse down
So fresh, so smooth I don't need to lie
Oh yes she moves she don't wonder why
I'm the man right now that it explains itself
Started poor now it's feeling like I'm trained for wealth
Need space so my mind is on a mission now
So fast, so far what I'm thinkin' bout, and I never had no time for your shit
I think, that's why they all mad
They don't like that I win
Success is in the air tonight
You pour yourself, your pouring mine you get your wealth, I'm getting mine
Your everything is extra fine
Your running out like extra time
I never meant to mess your mind
But it's kinda how the story goes
If my brains stayed the same till the story goes
Bring it all back with the way to act
And they talk that smack in aren't hearing that
Bring it all back for the street to have
You can have that crown I don't need it back
What I've learnt for this tickin time
Hustle world bruz gotta have that business mind
I'm heading out to the unknown
I'm cruising you can watch me go

[Hook]
Lightin' weed in the hood that I grew up in
Like fuck it man it's nothin'
Fuck all who I trust man
People ask me do I trust them

[Hook]
Lightin' weed in the hood that I grew up in
Like fuck it man it's nothin'
Fuck all who I trust man
People ask me do I trust them
