[Verse 1: Kerser & Fortay]
This is for the kid, lost with nowhere to go
The kid that knows that there’s hope when his parents don’t
Understand, staring at the smoke, dreaming big
Or the kid trying to make it out from where he lives
The kid that hits the books and studies for his A+
The kid living like a crook that only takes drugs
To escape, 'cause he’s lost, and never found trust
All he cared, working hard, from the ground up
Or the girl waking up to face the world alone
For the single mum trying to build a happy home
With no man trying to feed the kids on the dole
Or the girl that needs a hit, dancing on the pole
Or the man, who breaks a sweat, but he stays in debt
The alcoholic at the pub always placing bets
The man facing stress, going through a breakup
Wants to give up, but he can’t, gotta make bucks

[Hook: Kerser]
Different shoes but we headed to the same place
This life we in, contradicting to the human race
Different places, different faces, but the same themes
The highs and lows, gonna face the things what will they be
Different people, different faces all across the globe
It ain't all about the dough, it’s bout what you know
Different shoes but we headed to the same place
This life we in, contradicting to the human race

[Verse 2: Kerser & Fortay]
The lost soul, out of clutch in the mental home
The inmate who doesn’t know when he’s comin’ home
The kid punching cones, thinking that the shit is cool
And not knowing what he’s missing when he’s skipping school
Or the kid just spawned knowing what’s ahead
In this life while another person faces death
For one it’s both, for the other, it’s his worst day
Or the gut working nine to five to earn pay
This is life same day different time frame
Play it right win or lose this is life’s game
Just the way it is, you must adapt to the stress and strain
Never give in to it all when it tests your brain
We all the same different shoes on the same track
The path of life we walking on, we can’t change that
Make the most of what you got, see you can hit the heights
Or you can hit the lows, it’s up to you on how you live your life

[Hook: Kerser]
Different shoes but we headed to the same place
This life we in, contradicting to the human race
Different places, different faces, but the same themes
The highs and lows, gonna face the things what will they be
Different people, different faces all across the globe
It ain't all about the dough, it’s bout what you know
Different shoes but we headed to the same place
This life we in, contradicting to the human race

[Verse 3: Kerser & Fortay]
Never knew I’d give advice at times I needed it
Why’d I start another habit when I need to quit
Seen some lows seen some highs, what be comin’ next?
Ain't I livin’ in the past the more I think ahead?
Wide awake, still got a dream been through nightmares
And you will fall if you think that life fair
Back in the day, scrapin’ for a stick to get a hit
Now we makin’ hits for the kids scraping for a stick
Now we on the stage doing music
That we make for you, I seeing all the stages
In our life that we made It through
Never give up no matter how hard the circumstance
First you must believe, find a dream, then you work your plan
No matter if the odds against, with common sense, look at me
Started as some kids from public housing, broke and hooked with weed
Made the most of what we got, you gotta do the same too
Stay true, and even though we ain't always in the same shoes

[Hook: Kerser]
Different shoes but we headed to the same place
This life we in, contradicting to the human race
Different places, different faces, but the same themes
The highs and lows, gonna face the things what will they be
Different people, different faces all across the globe
It ain't all about the dough, it’s bout what you know
Different shoes but we headed to the same place
This life we in, contradicting to the human race
