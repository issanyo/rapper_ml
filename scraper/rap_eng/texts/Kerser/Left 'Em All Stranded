It's Kerser walkin' up in the LMG
Saddy bag rap call it LSD
The new king of aus rap if you like it or not,
Got the rap, got the hook, and the style is hot, what
Step on stage straight away screamin' fuck you
Forgettin' my own shit I'mma blame the mushrooms.
I'm so out of it lookin' like I'm not awake,
Still bang a hit, make your putrid body shake
On another place 'nother level outta space
They still tryna' work out where they found my face
You should travel with me, you can live the life
Work it out yourself I don't like to give advice
Still I sacrifice everything to chase this
I chase money and ya honey wants to chase this
I just write the same shit and ya brain trip
My rap tippin' trucks and it make a train flip
Other rappers sayin' home is where the heart is
But we from the South West ain't that the hardest?
Don't you say I sold out that some fake shit
I kept it real smelt cash then I claimed it
I'm arrogant cause you made me this way
I went and made history now I'm pavin' the way
For other street artists to get dollars and that
But for now it's my time and I'm hoggin' it lad
I met a fan and he had tears in his eyes
He said no I fuckin' don't I am clearly just high?
I got big things planned bruz trust the cunt
They talk so much shit but never front with one
So, that says enough about the state of the scene
Plus the photos of my mates I got they in the greens
I choppin' up sly on the flight again
So it's ready to be lit as the flight would land, man
Came a long way from hangin' in an alley way
Left on Tuesday wasn't back 'til Saturday
Call it happy days flyin' to the next show
Future god of this shit someone let 'em know
They already know, they just block it out
If I battle yo' someone start a body count
These motherfuckers here do the Kers
And think I'm only capable to write a stupid verse
Then they hear some real shit and it hits 'em hard
They got too much pride to call it sick, I laugh
I'm the realest out the lot, cut promotion off
Too many fish in the sea you in the ocean, lost
So with it motherfucker I'm settin' the standard
But in the process I fuckin' left 'em all stranded
Lost in a world I could be shootin' dope
But I'm just sittin' high in a Gucci coat
Miracle watch a cunt make a dream true
Saved your life when you thinkin' you could dream too
LMG hit me up come and lay a verse
I said to me all I gotta do is say a word
I'm so confident, here's an example
Within a month I'll be the highest viewed on this channel
Ah, here he goes again talkin' on his cocky shit
But they still all listen when I wanna spit
Sit on the back you can watch the Kers kill shit
Force some rappers to retire and they will quit!
Still miss the people that I fell outta touch with
Even if they at home thinkin' I'm a fuckwit
This is what I call me crawling in your fucking brain
Rearrange your cells and make you stab your lovely mothers veins
Calling me a swag rapper, what the fuck's a swag rapper?
Stay street, dirty rap call it bad grammar
One hit you fall apart like a bad hammer
One hit you fall apart that's some bad hammer
You fuckin' mess I'm on top of my shit
Two twos with a five we a popular clique
Got the new album comin' that's three from three
You been workin' on your EP shit for years
My team we the best shit, that's a fact
I say this shit to ya face I won't stab ya back
We out
