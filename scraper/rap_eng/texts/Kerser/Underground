[Verse 1]
I ain't expect that
They told me get back
What you struggle for makes sense why I get cash
And life change just like people do
You see the pain in my eyes when I speak to you
Funny how your best friend can turn into your enemy
I coulda got lost in the trap if I let it be
Copper chase, hit the legs, watch the night go
Tell the lookout "if you spot 'em, yell out 5-0"
Livin' in the moment, you see it as a bliss but
Dirty coppers only swung when they got my wrist cuffed
I'm from a different cloth, if it's Kers it isn't Scott
Life threw me obstacles but never did I think to stop
My dream man it came true, stayed in the same crew
When you get pay and you brag people hate you
Just for now I'm out cold on my last hope
People lost rackin' lines with their last smoke

[Hook]
Please never leave if you leave I'll break
Meet my mate, I guess drugs are my 5-8
So lost and I can't be found
I'm underground with a hundred pound
Please never leave if you leave I'll break
Meet my mate, I guess drugs are my 5-8
So lost and I can't be found
I'm underground where the drugs are found

[Verse 2]
And how I escape well I sit and blaze
You won't never hear the truth from the things they say
I'll take your brain for a walk, and you must not hate
You see hungry kids where the fuckin' gunshots lay
You see dealers, see knives, with no regard for lives
And these rappers rapping 'bout how the rainbows is nice shit
I don't expect them to understand, but to open up your eyes and maybe come and stand and try
Visualise life on the street, we got heart
And label your raps as whack it's not art
Exaggerate what? I ain't exaggerate shit
If you knew what I mean, you knew I had to make it
Had to pack out shows, gave the street a voice
Used to dack our drugs when I meet the boys
Our only escape, when we roamin' the streets
My lifeline was rapping, hope you know what I mean
And please

[Hook x4]
Please never leave if you leave I'll break
Meet my mate, I guess drugs are my 5-8
So lost and I can't be found
I'm underground with a hundred pound
Please never leave if you leave I'll break
Meet my mate, I guess drugs are my 5-8
So lost and I can't be found
I'm underground where the drugs are found
