On your face speak of face yo I'm hearing they hate that
Whole else you know could get their fucking name as a face tatt?
They ask me why I do it like ya up myself

You get me buried in a cemetery scary
If you do it then I'm daring
Take my wallet what I'm wearing
Take it all we can brawl
You can flatten me squashed dead
Reality will have it it ain't happening cock head
Kers around the street with the criminal straight crooks
You in your room you're buying clothes you typing on Facebook
You want the fucking raps who the man to check

I'm telling veterans that Kerser one demands respect
That's why I'm walking into clubs to the V.I.P
You rope it off I want the drugs and everything for free
Now I think I got em mad

With a bag and It's wrapped
Glad fact it's dacked
Back to back champion

To cash it in cash it in

So if I want to do you then your twats is bruised
But I got a girl so I don't need a groupie bitch

The music industry ain't ready for a kid from the slums
I'm like the fuck you to music fucking dick up the bum
Don't compare me to no one cause there's no one like me
I mean in real life and I mean when I flow on a beat
