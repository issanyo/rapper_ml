(Baby [?])
(Listen to your heart)
(Listen to your heart)

In a space of my own
I spent days on the phone
Tryin’ to make this s*** happen
Felt dazed and alone
Always blazin’ the cones
Still king of this Oz rap

Next decade, tell ‘em chill
‘Cause I got that
Quarter past 4
Wine glass with some high notch
Bottle’s worth more
Than what’s on your man’s fire watch
(Fire watch, fire watch)

Someone questioned me the other day
They asked me was it worth it
With all of the f*****’ fame
I had to think about,
Still I don’t know
But if I didn’t rap
I’d still be that one broke

But the f*****’ fame,
Oh man, the f*****’ fame
Enough to make me wanna hide
And never make returns again
But it’s the life that I asked for
What to say
That [?] s***
And I just smashed the auto bay

Think to f*** rap
I’d rather live normal
Then the f*****’ cash
Send a mere mortal

Listen to your heart
When it’s tough, we’ll get through
Listen to your heart
I’ve always been here for you

You know that I’m here,
Know that I’m there
I’ll be there for you
Without a doubt,
That’s my promise and I swear

Listen to your heart
(Heart, heart, heart, heart... )

I watch rappers come
And I watch rappers go
But they all crawlin’ back,
‘Cause they realize that’s my show
And the label that we runnin’
They be chasin’ for that dotted line
But ya gotta be special
With your think and [?] sign

I’m writin’ this,
Penthouse on the balcony
Put myself in your shoes,
I’m thinkin’ how can he
Rise up, run s***
Like a true boss
Shooters in my crew,
So I’m set if they do cross

Pray every day
So I ain’t seen my world messed
Holdin’ s*** down,
But I stress when my girl’s stressed
Or my crew’s stressed
Then we gotta move, yes
Take our competition
With our beef on your computers

We keep it real
If you see me in a new whip
It means I’ve got another
Parked next to my other two
Nothin’ rented, straight invested
I’m a smart one
Cash for life
Got it pumpin’ through my heart

Listen to your heart
When it’s tough,
We’ll get through
Listen to your heart
I’ve always been here for you
(Been here for you)

You know that I’m here,
Know that I’m there
I’ll be there for you
Without a doubt,
That’s my promise and I swear

Listen to your heart
(Got it pumpin’ through my heart)

Man, this all spin me out
How I make it, Aussie town
They call me king
And give the crown
Got these haters facin’ down
And I’m out here pacin’ ‘round
F*****’ stage to stage
Doin’ show to show
Switchin’ flow to flow

And, oh, you know
I top charts without radio
And that include arias,
Don’t ya say it so?
DVDs, CDs
Number one
And when this drops,
Guaranteed number one

Have to brag,
Put these haters in they place
Rub in the doubters’ face
Like I told you,
Made ‘em gray (Gray)

And what’s the cursed to do?
Oh, God, it’s hurtin’ you
I got tricks up my sleeve
I could burst with news
Element of surprise
See your eyes and you cry
‘Cause you watched me from the f*****’ start
And knew I had the drive (Drive, drive)

And that’s the s*** ya need
(S*** ya need, s*** ya need, need, need)

Listen to your heart
When it’s tough,
We’ll get through
Listen to your heart
I’ve always been here for you
(Been here for you)

You know that I’m here,
Know that I’m there
I’ll be there for you
Without a doubt,
That’s my promise and I swear

Listen to your heart
(Listen to your heart)
(Got it pumpin’ through my heart)
