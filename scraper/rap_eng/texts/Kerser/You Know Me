[Verse 1]
I don't know who you are, I'm a Youtube star
If the views payed cash, I'd have two new cars
See I'm just having fun but the cash will come
When I quit being lazy, get it happening
Man the LP's coming but we took our time
Got the recipe, flavour and we cooked it right
Now you wittiness sickness mixed with fitness
When it comes to rap, if you break it, I'll fix it
Ballistic, sadistic, check the statistics
I could say kill yourself, your kids would have the wrist slit
Fuck that, what I need you to do
Light the base with the weed, when you breath it in "ooh"
Best feeling like the feeling that my rap gives
When I have kids, they'll be running the rap biz
Twenty years from now, your kids knowing the name
My kids will have your kids going insane

[Hook]
You know me
And if you don't know you better ask someone
You know me
Put the drugs in the saddy and you pass me some
You know me
And if you don't know you better ask someone
You know me
Put the drugs in the saddy and you pass me some

[Verse 2]
On stage, got a beer for a mic
Crowd be yelling out "we ain't hearing you right"
Whoops my bad, yep that be my bag
I get high lad, high like times that
Buy five times nine, buy five times nine
Now you seeing what be going through my mind
Write rhymes, my sky dive at night time
Jumping of a Jetstar told you that a fly guys
High ride at the same time nice guy
What they call me if I'm sniffing on a white line
Drive by with a fly by might try
Put the fly by card in the wifi
Internet laptop what to say next
Did it make sense? Don't care 'cause I'm great yes
They stress cause they struggling to catch me
Indian cabbies got my pumping in the taxis

[Hook]
You know me
And if you don't know you better ask someone
You know me
Put the drugs in the saddy and you pass me some
You know me
And if you don't know you better ask someone
You know me
Put the drugs in the saddy and you pass me some

[Verse 3]
Kay cuz we can blame drugs, ayy bruz
Got a dollar for a rapper with a taped up
Nokia but I'm hoping it works
Get a phone call: "Hello, is this kers"
I can't hear now I gotta hang up
Smoking on my profit so I can't even slang drugs
Shit's fucked up still see a happy side
People see my music and they knowing that the raps alive
It's alive and you knowing that it's all good
I shut you out, something like a door would
Your hood full of mansions and rich cunts
My hood full of cancer and sick drugs
Sick sluts in a sick truck shit bruh
Should I even mention that they ganged her got her wrists cuffed
Hick ups but I still got a sick pass
Gotta call it a quits 'cause I'm bout to have a fit, fuck

[Hook]
You know me
And if you don't know you better ask someone
You know me
Put the drugs in the saddy and you pass me some
You know me
And if you don't know you better ask someone
You know me
Put the drugs in the saddy and you pass me some

[Outro/Skit]
Hello, you've reached Kerser
I'm unavailable to get to your call at the moment
If you leave your name and number, I'll get back to you
Hello, Kerser brother, it's me
You never answer your calls
You no good with your phone
Uh, you told me taxi [?]
