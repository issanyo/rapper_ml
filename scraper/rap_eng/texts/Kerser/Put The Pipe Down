[Hook: Kerser & Rates]
Last night I swear I put the pipe down
Put the pipe down, put the, put put the pipe down
Woke up and filled it with a rock now
With a rock now, with a, with with a rock now
Popped pills, it's real, we needing help now
Needing help now, needing, need needing help now
All alone, I've got to sit myself down
Sit my self down, sit my, sit sit myself down

[Verse 1: Rates]
My thoughts changing up, wait today I waited up
You light the pipe, ignite a rhyme and think you write creative stuff
But deep inside you try to hide anxiety that makes you nuts
Are we chasing fate, or fate will wait to make its way to us
Escaping when we're taking drugs, crave it like you crave for junk
Make you grab a safe and do a break so you can blaze it up
I've witnessed bitches scratch their wrists, itching till they're making cuts
Crazy cunts are dacking people, bashing their own babies mums
Is this the shit that's gonna rip, if that's the case I gave it up
Giving this admission its the hardest thing, I'm waking up
Are you gonna wait we both the same, same in the way that we go insane
Craving the taste of the base that we chase and I pray for the day that it goes away
I know complaining won't do shit and yeah its up to us
At least I'm honest, I ain't hiding most you cunts are suss
So stand here and watch me smash this fucking glass pipe
Hassle and a hazard and I swear this is my last time

[Hook: Kerser & Rates]
Last night I swear I put the pipe down
Put the pipe down, put the, put put the pipe down
Woke up and filled it with a rock now
With a rock now, with a, with with a rock now
Popped pills, it's real, we needing help now
Needing help now, needing, need needing help now
All alone, I've got to sit myself down
Sit my self down, sit my, sit sit myself down

[Verse 2: Kerser]
Where'd I go wrong, what I just seen man I need a medic
Get a feeling, energetic, when I'm walking past the chemist
Is this the end is it cause I am ready take my soul
I'm already ready high, so tell me what you waiting for
Rates just rocked up with the leanie and the vallies too
I join him with the Xannies, perfect mix like fucking alley oop
Something tells me, ask him if he needs help man my brain flips
How I'm gonna ask him that, I mean I'm on the same shit
Worst state of my life that I have ever been, I won't lie
How can I be fucked up, but career wise man I'm so high
I'm zoning out and I got nowhere to run
Ain't gonna get a second chance and now I'm roaming with rum
I fight through what I'm going through, but what I'm going through if only two
Tablets did the trick, I'd be in heaven but that only do
Equivalent to half a cone I need a fucking sheet now
Just woke up to pop the pills I need another sleep wow

[Hook: Kerser & Rates]
Last night I swear I put the pipe down
Put the pipe down, put the, put put the pipe down
Woke up and filled it with a rock now
With a rock now, with a, with with a rock now
Popped pills, it's real, we needing help now
Needing help now, needing, need needing help now
All alone, I've got to sit myself down
Sit my self down, sit my, sit sit myself down
