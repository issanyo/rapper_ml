[Intro]
Yeah
It's Kerser
Fifth album in five years
It's album number five
I'm still high
With your girlfriend

[Verse 1]
This the shit they waiting for, put earphones in it shakes your jaw
What the fuck you take me for? I'm only here to break the law
Kerser is the sickest, yes, it's said again, he did it
Poppin' medicine, you kiddin', got adrenaline, I'm in it
I'm in the zone, I give you shivers you know
I got ridiculous flows, is there a limit or not?
'Cause I can switch it up at any second, blame it on the Xannies
Yep, and act like I forgot and come back like "are yous ready yet?"
Fuck me dead, he never stops with this, it's arrogance
I bought your CD and used the cover when I had a shit
I give a fuck about a rapper I enroll with
I got a batch I'm 'bout to feed 'em up another cold dish
You heard about me from the last four albums
They back alive well I'm comin' back to drown 'em
Your worst fear, it's the Kerser one
Ten years ago I would've grabbed your fucking purse and run
Fuck

[Hook]
Kers one, I'm the only rap you need, man
Heard the last who called me whack end up bleeding
ABK, that's the crew of this rap shit
Enemies end up dead if they attack this
Kers one, I'm the only king you need, brah
Heard my albums like bullets to your knees, huh
ABK, that's the crew of this rap shit
Enemies end up dead if they attack this

[Verse 2]
This the shit they hate me for, I'm gonna make 'em hate me 'cause
I steal these rappers fans 'cause they hear me and they just rate me more
It ain't my fault that I keep topping these charts
But I'ma brag about it, fuckin' Kerser's popular brah
What the fuck? The flow I'm spitting keeps on switching and you listen
'Cause my mission is your ears to grab and take a fucking shit in
I know that's how it feels to haters see you laters
I made it, I prayed it, then played it and slayed it
The greatest, shit that's a fucking long reach
But if we talking in Oz you know it's on me
The king of this, the fucking history maker
Hall of fame when I say the "see you later"
Fuck the scene, I always knew it was fake
I had a dream it came real then it blew em away
And hating on me only made me get big
You should've kept your thoughts to yourself 'cause baby I'm rich

[Hook]
Kers one, I'm the only rap you need, man
Heard the last who called me whack end up bleeding
ABK, that's the crew of this rap shit
Enemies end up dead if they attack this
Kers one, I'm the only king you need, brah
Heard my albums like bullets to your knees huh
ABK, that's the crew of this rap shit
Enemies end up dead if they attack this

[Bridge]
I am still the same Kers, from the start I made the
Choice to go and lay verses and made you hate worse
Never ever cared though, you faker then a scarecrow
Smoking in my chair bro, I should be the mayor yo
I am just the best lad, creatively address that
Wanna hear your neck snap, bullets and you get that
If you go and spread that to the fucking feds that
Means you gonna get smashed, not breathing in a wet bag

[Hook]
Kers one, I'm the only rap you need, man
Heard the last who called me whack end up bleeding
ABK, that's the crew of this rap shit
Enemies end up dead if they attack this
Kers one, I'm the only king you need, brah
Heard my albums like bullets to your knees huh
ABK, that's the crew of this rap shit
Enemies end up dead if they attack this
