[Verse: 1]
I try to tell them that I’m one of a kind
But this worlds fucked up and kept a brother in a line
They covered me with fines back in my broke days
When would hit the bridge so we could oke-smay
No jokes made they laughed at me at the start
Then I got a bit of money and it’s broken their heart
The governments fucked up, they never cared about us
A single mother on the bus charging double on her pass
The rich ignore, but me I won’t ignore that
Probably cause I been there and I made it out the poor patch
Community would wise up, shit I’m the voice for that
If you a real man stand up, ain’t no choice in that
Seen it all, my crew we were the broke cunts
That’s why we spun out when the Kerser got his notes up
The cobra clutch, I’m not stuck in the way
I’m just living my life the day something’s gotta change

[Hook]
Ain’t nobody get my mission, making them aware
That people out here everywhere they hungry, ain’t got anywhere
To stay, it’s okay, cause we brainwashed it’s normal
I’m tryna wake them up, I’ve seen people living awful
But they ain’t gonna care it don’t effect them in the slightest way
They can lick their cheques and ignore then go hide away
What we gonna do, when nobody ain’t doing shit?
And they wonder why there’s people turning into lunatics

[Verse: 2]
And all I hear on the news is some bullshit
A bunch of lies written just to keep the fools tricked
You ever been on a train in the South West?
You know for when the cunts were pulling out yeah
I ain’t even gotta say it cause the real know
The government plans, spin them in a wheel bro
They want the broke broke, they want the rich rich
That’s why they hate when I made it out the ditch bitch
Now I gotta be the voice cause the spotlight
Is on me it ain’t nothin' making Scott hide
I think we need another voice for the underhand
And I can do it off a dollar made a hundred grand
Off that hundred made another couple hundred too
Couple hundred K, piss ‘em off they see me move
The town house to big house, did it with my spits how
We ever gonna change? You’re listening to a king now

[Hook]
Ain’t nobody get my mission, making them aware
That people out here everywhere they hungry, ain’t got anywhere
To stay, it’s okay, cause we brainwashed it’s normal
I’m tryna wake them up, I’ve seen people living awful
But they ain’t gonna care it don’t effect them in the slightest way
They can lick their cheques and ignore then go hide away
What we gonna do, when nobody ain’t doing shit?
And they wonder why there’s people turning into lunatics

[Verse: 3]
I never been a preacher and I ain’t need a teacher
I just find it funny you used to treat me like a creature
Like “nah mate, you ain’t fitting in the dress code”
That felt pretty shit when I was in my best clothes
Always broke, stuck just how they wanted us
I made it flip, now the government want me bust
No way, I’m too strong and I’m smart too
I could start a war and rally up a harsh crew
But end of day the media gonna twist the shit
Make me look like liar or a hypocrite
So I’m here for my fans, hope they understand
That I’m here so it’s possible for other plans
Kers 1 I’m going down in the history books
I rewrote Aussie rap check the history, look
I ain’t even gonna say what the Kers done
They join the puzzle after every single verse cunt

[Hook]
Ain’t nobody get my mission, making them aware
That people out here everywhere they hungry, ain’t got anywhere
To stay, it’s okay, cause we brainwashed it’s normal
I’m tryna wake them up, I’ve seen people living awful
But they ain’t gonna care it don’t effect them in the slightest way
They can lick their cheques and ignore then go hide away
What we gonna do, when nobody ain’t doing shit?
And they wonder why there’s people turning into lunatics
