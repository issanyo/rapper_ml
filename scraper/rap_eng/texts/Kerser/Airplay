[Verse 1]
ABK Records, everybody wanna sign a deal
To impress me, you gotta rack a line of pills
You gotta have some big tits, wearin' nine-inch heels
And show us how the pussy work, fuck your rhyming skills
I’m walking in to Centrelink like "remember me?"
I’m rich now, I got a house you can rent for free
I’m only here from when you cut my fuckin' payments
Back in two-thousand-and-eight and I ain’t say shit
Well this my payback, petrol on the front desk
Lit it up, thank you all, then I fuckin' left
They see my getaway, I think it was an Audi
It could’ve been a Range Rover, I don’t know he’s out here
What kind of car was it? Man this shit is marvelous
I just popped like fifty pills and I was meant to halve the shit
Fuck your bitch with a satty full of x pills
Now slit the bag so she trippin', I’m a mess still

[Hook]
Bitches get your tits out, put your fuckin' hands up
All my real song just time for us to stand up
I made this for the radio, I hope I get the airplay
Cunt, clitoris, fuck, I wasn’t meant to swear mate
Bitches get your tits out, put your fuckin' hands up
All my real song just time for us to stand up
I made this for the radio, I hope I get the airplay
Cunt, clitoris, fuck, I wasn’t meant to swear mate

[Verse 2]
So I was down the beach right, sittin’ on my beach towel
I heard a bitch scream, it sounded like a big "ah"
I though "hmm, Kerser to the rescue?"
I let the bitch drown, I had to use the restroom
No wonder parents ain’t let the kids listen up
Hey kids, sniff glue and you can say "cunt"
Don’t listen to the teachers, don’t even stay in school
But if we talkin’ 'bout my daughter, we got different rules
She a princess and I have double standards
Okay my aim's done, I pissed off all the parents
What about the other night, I was eatin' mushrooms
I tripped the fuck out and hit my missus with a dust broom
Mamma, God, I’m sorry babe, I don’t know what was happening
I know I promised you, I wouldn’t say it in a rap again
But I did as I wheelie on a push bike
I don’t even know these rappers' names or what they look like

[Hook]
Bitches get your tits out, put your fuckin' hands up
All my real song just time for us to stand up
I made this for the radio, I hope I get the airplay
Cunt, clitoris, fuck, I wasn’t meant to swear mate
Bitches get your tits out, put your fuckin' hands up
All my real song just time for us to stand up
I made this for the radio, I hope I get the airplay
Cunt, clitoris, fuck, I wasn’t meant to swear mate

[Verse 3]
This the part where I’m gettin’ on my sad stuff
And have a sook like "my life isn’t adding up"
Here’s a tablet bruh, look into the camera
Now take a photo, you’re lookin’ like an amateur
Shut the fuck up, my rappin’ like a nail bomb
I'ma drop it all off at a nail salon
Bitches runnin’ now, you could say I nailed ‘em
And I wonder why the public keep hatin’ man

[Hook]
Bitches get your tits out, put your fuckin' hands up
All my real song just time for us to stand up
I made this for the radio, I hope I get the airplay
Cunt, clitoris, fuck, I wasn’t meant to swear mate
Bitches get your tits out, put your fuckin' hands up
All my real song just time for us to stand up
I made this for the radio, I hope I get the airplay
Cunt, clitoris, fuck, I wasn’t meant to swear mate
