[Verse 1]
Life's a road that you follow til its closed off
Pick a turn make a break before the roads blocked
Many follow they dont really pick their own paths
Me I'm different see they welcome me with closed arms
I just shrug 'em off, tell 'em they can have it back
It changes everything, let me tell you tragic facts
Mates treat you different, swear to god they think your changing
In your brain you stay the same and now you can't put up with fame
And once that paranoia settles in, your barely going public
Just to leave your fucking suburb need to rally up an army I mean
Hold my head high, now I got them red eyes
State to state forget about a decent sleep or bed time
I'm on my girls nerves, always on the fucking move
She thinks I changed I tell her girl you gotta trust me too
Otherwise, right in front of her eyes
She's gonna watch me fall apart got people judging my life
But fuck em

[Hook]
Tears come streaming down your face
When you leave something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

[Verse 2]
It's funny back in class, teachers said I'm hopeless
They said they seen potential but I lack the focus
Funny twist, I was dreaming of this
I hope they see me now compare our fucking payments and shit
Man I swear in the back of my mind, I knew it'd happen in time
And now its actually mine, so
Does that mean what I seen was another sign?
Or am I crazy and I'm searching for another rhyme
Its like there's two of me, rapping what it do to me
All I've done was keep it real, and now you see the truth in me
I ain't never mean to glorify drugs
I just told you bout my road and now the story's blown up
But I'mma ride it out, fucking oath I'm riding proud
We can go together all you gotta do is find the sound
I'm not depressed, nah that wouldn't be the right word
In the studio I leave my mark and the mic's burn

[Hook]
Tears come streaming down your face
When you leave something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

[Verse 3]
Am I ever on your mind? Do you listen when I rhyme?
So far up, never missing a design
Cause I'm the blueprint, time yeah it moves quick
Try and fit my shoes kid, rumours never true shit
Jesus had his haters, haters let me know I made it
Crazy crazy I invade it, maybe ABK be blazing
Blazing up a green batch, me I got the weed dacked
Trying to be a man about it, shit I gotta fiend cash
I ain't used to it, that's probably why I spend it quick
Rappin' is my life I put that shit on everything
I look you in the eye if you admit that this is mine
They like to backstab like a shiv hitting my spine
I just pull it out, sharpen it and throw it back
Bullseye, hit the marker, got a flow that's fat
You could stop the beat I need to know its sinking in
My life is crazy god reminds me that I wished for this

[Hook]
Tears come streaming down your face
When you leave something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?
