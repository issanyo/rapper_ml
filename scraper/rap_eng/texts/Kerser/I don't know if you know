[Intro:]
It's Kerser
Yo

[Verse 1:]
They got me buzzin', Album 5 sounds like dynamite
And when it drops another million rappers bite it right?
I'm used to it by now, fuck I've been through everything
A new producer by my side, is this what's meant to be?
Now they questioning but i ain't gonna answer shit
Major labels wanna talk - what's a man to think?
I threw my fucking program off to get my album done
And now my doctor's asking how I'm fucking living ahhh
I don't know what to tell him music runs my life
I don't got the time to be here every Monday night
And, if I have a break with music, fans are on my back
But I don't blame 'em, it's the Kers, you need a lot of that
I'm just staring out the view of my new car
It's almost like I've hit the point where I've come too far
Only do it cause the fans need me right now
So how the fuck can I not give them my life - how?

[Hook:]
Do this for my damn crew, do this for my fans too
I don't know if you know, I ain't stopped from Down The Drain ooh
See my world change, money made my world strange
Money makes the world go round, but money's on the world's pay
Do this for my damn crew, do this for my fans too
I don't know if you know, I ain't stopped from Down The Drain ooh
See my world change, money made my world strange
Money makes the world go round, but money's on the world's pay

[Verse 2:]
Sometimes I think if I was broke then I would be okay
'Cause I've been on both sides of that and seen the people change
Like when you broke ain't no-one gonna hit you phone up
But when you're cashed up you won't wanna own a phone bruh
Learn from Kers I'm the king to hustle music
I got rich from this shit YOU fucking do it
Instead of hating cos your CD's don't sell at all
You should be inspired made a win no help at all
It's what the Kers did all from fucking words writ
Top the charts had the industry like "Fucking word? Shit!"
And then these labels chasing for another signature
The future's looking even brighter I'm a winner bruh
And I'ma bring the whole crew to the end of this
ABK 225 - Don't forget that shit
If the fans are feeling fucked, who they run to?
They come to Kers I can save their life with one tune

[Hook:]
Do this for my damn crew, do this for my fans too
I don't know if you know, I ain't stopped from Down The Drain ooh
See my world change, money made my world strange
Money makes the world go round, but money's on the world's pay
Do this for my damn crew, do this for my fans too
I don't know if you know, I ain't stopped from Down The Drain ooh
See my world change, money made my world strange
Money makes the world go round, but money's on the world's pay

[Verse 3:]
Calm before the storm, wait till this album drops
I'll have a hater skitzing out like they outta pot
I'll have these rappers copying like "How'd he do that shit?"
They either gonna bite, hate or admit it's sick
I hit a goal in the states with some new beats
A long shot but they hit me back like do this
And i ain't gonna drop their name till this shit drops
If you knew behind the scenes you would just agree with Scot
I'm over stressing what the public fucking thinks of me
As long as I am on the rise I'm making history
Probably take a couple years to realise what I've done
I changed the sound of rap in Aus since i got my buzz
And rappers hating I'll leave 'em on the floor again
Don't they realise that I'm opening the door for them
They can lay back, man you's are washed up
Can dreams come true? Shit look at Scott cunt

[Hook:]
Do this for my damn crew, do this for my fans too
I don't know if you know, I ain't stopped from Down The Drain ooh
See my world change, money made my world strange
Money makes the world go round, but money's on the world's pay
Do this for my damn crew, do this for my fans too
I don't know if you know, I ain't stopped from Down The Drain ooh
See my world change, money made my world strange
Money makes the world go round, but money's on the world's pay
