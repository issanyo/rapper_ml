[Intro]
Yeah
It's Kerser
Fuck's happenin'? (nothing man, just pretty stoned)
Pack the billy
Roll a spliff
Crack the drink

[Verse]
I've been around, I seen the streets, I seen a lot of shit
I seen my old enemies, the cunts are on my dick
The world changed I ain't just better on mics
If we comparing me and you, I'm just better at life
I got time for my friends, fam and my fucking fans man
Cutting both your arms off, asking you to do a handstand
I'm the man damn blood spot I'm van dan in the dam bam pass you house it goes bam bam
Try me man I'm higher than the highest higher man
I'm higher then the highest of the highest highest I'll stand
Understand I stacking notes with a rubber band
Is enough to turn the K-e-r-s to an ugly man
You ain't wanna meet me when I'm freakin', peakin', tweakin'
'Bout to sneak into your parents house a lesson I'ma teach em
You ask around you ask em now I ain't afraid you bitches
Kerser is the sickest Ker-Ker-Kerser is the sickest
Who the man, I'm the man and they know this
If they say they didn't they just act like they ain't notice
Bro quick they on the edge of their seat
They can't handle when the Kerser comes to rep on the beat
I'm at the end of your street 'cause you pretendin' to be
A bad cunt 'cause you went and sold a tenner of weed?
At the center is me, I'm the electricity
What you need it when you have it, maggot come try testing me
I'm the L-M-N-O-P, I'm the A-B-C to D
I'm the E-F to the G, scrap that, I'm A to Z
I'm everything you know and need the haters probably blowin' me
The freshest with the poetry the flow with beat, you know it's me
I'm the supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
You stupid faggots battle me, you know I be the dopest
You motherfuckers go and talk about it, be the closest
You'll never find the same until one day, they try to clone this

[Outro]
