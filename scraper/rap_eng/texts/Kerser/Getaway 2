You know we can get away
Yeah its Kerser, Fortay bang bang, check

[kerser]
Im still trying to get my head around this fucking life
Hit the top spot and they still wonder why
I just want to get high, mix my lean up
Write my raps on my phone I can't see the screen bruz
Cause' I'm fucked up, call it double vision
Look into my eyes you can see the trouble in them
Hit the heights and said i'd never ever get there
Killed the competition, they don't have a chance to get square
Thats why i'm confident rollin through the back streets
Topping charts every fucking album, try attack me
It will crush your career like a [?]
Put these rappers next to us nah they aren't cool
Do it for the raw lad, trying to flip a four pack
So who can get a start in life and get up from the four cash
Can change people but never change the kers though
I'll be 45 blinged out with the fur coat

[Fortay]
Startin off as the underdog people love ya
Next you get a bit bigger then they saying fuck ya
What you reckon cause i'm making songs I lost connection
Duckin heat In these fucking streets got me sweating
I got more a fucking wrist then I did before
From the ground up not trying to hit the floor
Built this shit from living poor to doing okay
And though the game from [?] to the cocaine
So my names a little known, fuck the fame but
Still the same cunt, blazing up gotta make a buck
Streets I held needed help and the dreams of wealth
Got me 'bout to see yourself and what I do to feed myself
Half the shit they want to know I can't tell them bout
Start them, get some dough say they you selling out
New year same shit I better move again
And if I made it out then what the fuck they doing here

[Fortay]
Step inside my shoes see if you can last a day
Journey through my path see if you don't fucking break
Fucking let a cunt hate they never live my life
Don't need to explain what I fucking did and why
Living on my own time, on my own race
See there be a thin line between love and hate
Gotta play the game but it's never by the rules
Before you judge a cunt step inside my fucking shoes

[Kerser]
Another late night, followed by an early flight
Rock the show see the fans screaming, don't go white
It's What they all say, giving rap my all mate
Just lit a spliff now i'm sparking it with fortay
Heart stone cold, feeling like i've grown old
Braggin on my tracks cause the fact that I own gold
If you were me though I guarantee you'd brag too
Talk behind my back that is something that a fag do
