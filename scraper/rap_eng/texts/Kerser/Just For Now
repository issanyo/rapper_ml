[Verse 1:]
I throw my hood on man I block it out
Swear the worlds gone crazy I gotta shout
At the top of my voice but I feel alone
Stepping on a plane to go kill a show
They said I'd never do it but I'm doing it true
And the biggest risk take is I do it for you
Haters get mad cause they see me shine
No attention to you, this here is mine
I fear the life that'll come when this stops
Rockstar shit cocaine in ziplocks
Wish not make moves and rise
Didn't work first time and im doin it twice
Hot headed, carve on the sentence
Marvellous efforts, half of them left this
But im here and im standing tall
They can all get fucked im demandin more
Party time and your free to come
Bitch to guy ratio is 3 to 1
We can get down we can do it right?
My gift can make you fly
Lift up, we ain't here for long
Gotta do this shit before we gone
Once your gone shit you ain't never come back
We just want this life, but im way too smashed
And I may just crash and fall from high
But I made it back im forced to write
Whats on my mind, nothin else
Two in your face go fuck yourself
There it is I ain't leave it too soon
Do what you do but with who and you knew
It can't be done like I can do
I hit ya hard write life for you

[Hook:]
Time to party
We ain't stoppin till the sun is rising
Options never running hiding
Them problems equals rums and lines
And anything that you gonn' do
I promise we gonn' do it better
Only live this life out once
And we gonn' make it last forever
Time to party
We ain't stoppin till the sun is rising
Options never running hiding
Them problems equals rums and lines
And anything that you gonn' do
I promise we gonn' do it better
Only live this life out once
And we gonn' make it last forever

[Verse 2:]
Make your mind up kerser gotta go
Another day we on the road
Never meant to ride through life
On a 9 to 5 need brighter lights
And I made that clear, I made them hear
Then I made them cheer
Came back with a name thats raised packs
No that means at the scene just laid back
Took it all and im takin more
Im the one that takes you to that place for sure
We can leave now are you ready or not
Gotta go before the energy stops
And when it does then whose to blame
Left or right you can choose your fate
I'mma leave ill be back in time
And I won't remember shit, yeah thats a lie
