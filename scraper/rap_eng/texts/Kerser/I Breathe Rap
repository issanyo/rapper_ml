[Verse 1]
Can you feel that? I call this real rap
The medicine for any kid who don't know where his meals at
Probably ask him five years why you deal lad
Flick his paper, grab the satty bag as he seals that
Cold world I'ma do my best to warm you up
Streets are crazy on the daily, better warn a cunt
Not political political so distant
To where I grew up you probably heard about the district
Call it different, heated like a summers day
My rays burn, make a hater fuckin' run away
Till my dying day, I'ma stay high mate
Running down a highway, find me in a driveway
Bottle of the Jack Black, who you trying to rap at?
I'ma try get my head straight but I back track
Every time I think I'ma try not to sink
Drive to the brink, high lightin' a spliff wish
Shit changed but in ways it stayed the same
To this day play the game, try to maintain but the fame
Does my fuckin' head in I ain't used to it yet
Yeah, I used to respect, you knew what I said
But these days I'm not sure if you relate
If you knew my fate true you'd be a mate
Anyone would 'cause I'm destined for greatness
Talking about Oz, I'm the best, I can say this

[Hook]
I live this life, this is my time
This is my mic right in the bright light
Everyday I breathe rap, feedback, I don't need that
Driving with my seat back, puffing on a weed patch
Don't tell me how to live
When there's a thousand kids, high vibed to the sound of this
I drop this here and they feeling free
Feel free till I die, I bet they feeling me

[Verse 2]
This is fucked man I'm tensing it up
Can't believe I'm halfway through and I ain't mentioned a drug
Does that mean I'm cleaning up? Is my life on a new road?
Soon as I turn the mic on it's like you know
And you know I'm your voice in fucking many ways
That's why you listen getting blazed on your wedding day
Your girl she's a fan too she know I'm the real deal
Walking down the street spinning out cos I feel ill
Sick of all these people acting nice cos I spit rhymes
Can't I sit back getting high and just live life?
Not the fans cos the fans are my whole life
I mean the people being nice expecting I'm a goldmine
They ain't gonna get shit but a fuck you
Too many people needing favours I ain't up too
Let me get away imma do my best to relax
As long as when I go they remember these facts

[Hook]
I live this life, this is my time
This is my mic right in the bright light
Everyday I breathe rap, feedback, I don't need that
Driving with my seat back, puffing on a weed patch
Don't tell me how to live
When there's a thousand kids, high vibed to the sound of this
I drop this here and they feeling free
Feel free till I die, I bet they feeling me

[Outro]
Another world getting cold, I'ma bring the heat
Hoping I am still here, will you even miss me?
Real rap, straight facts and that's that
The king talks, you're not allowed to backchat
Another world getting cold, I'ma bring the heat
Hoping I am still here, will you even miss me?
Real rap, straight facts and that's that
The king talks, you're not allowed to backchat
