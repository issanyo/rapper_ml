[Intro: Kerser]
Yeah, Kerser
Fuck what you think
Remix

[Verse 1: Kerser]
Life I'm livin' man it's crazy and I'm spinnin' out
Kerser made it man you've got that shit to think about
Sticky weed on my fingers and they stuck together
Ladies meet me once I swear to God they're in love forever
I'm something special, something crazy, I'm the the fuckin' thrill
What you need and I done this without a fuckin' deal
Who you know that got a sicker flow lad
See me with a notepad thinkin' "how he wrote that?"
So good and I keep getting better, shit
"When you gonna stop?" When they ever find a better kid
Not happenin' the Kers is here
And the next ten of these are fuckin' Kerser's years
So put your hands up high and light the weed
And ignore all the rappers that are biting me, yeah

[Pre-Hook: Empire of the Sun (Sample), Kerser]
Walking on a dream
Livin' in a dream so what's the difference?
How can I explain?
On so many drugs I'm always lifted
Talking to myself
Talkin' to myself in my head again
Will I see again?
Will I, will I ever learn?
We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Haha, yeah
Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it
Let it roll, check
On and on and on we are calling out, out again
Oi I'ma do something here
Never looking down I'm just in awe of what's...
Yeah here, watch

[Hook: Kerser, Empire of the Sun (Sample)]
High high, I'm always high
Is it real now?
High high, I'm always high
High high, I'm always high
When two people become one?
High high high high always high
High high, I'm always high
Is it real now?
High high, I'm always high
High high, I'm always high
When two people become one?
High high high high always high

[Verse 2: Kerser]
Come and join me pour the drink
Couple years ago too poor to think, now
I got a stack of notes and I'm spendin' crazy
They're all mine, I ain't lendin' baby
Went from a train to a car to a car to a plane
No Rest For The Sickest, gotta do it again
But i don't complain 'cause I love the shit
Have to pack small cones 'cause my lungs are ripped, shit
Keep moving, never gonna fall off
Haters man they love me, they just got a sore spot
Cause me yeah, I'm living the dream
Underground King, always spittin' it mean
Signed off once cause The Kerser hit
What this a pop song? but I burnt it yeah
No joke, dope smoke and I won't choke
Listen when I rap nothing better than my flow? No

[Pre-Hook: Empire of the Sun (Sample), Kerser]
We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Aha, yeah
Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it
Alright
I'm gonna drop that shit again
On and on and on we are calling out, out again
Remember that high shit?
Never looking down I'm just in awe of what's in front of me
Yeah, 'cause I'm

[Hook: Kerser, Empire of the Sun (Sample)]
High high, I'm always high
Is it real now?
High high, I'm always high
High high, I'm always high
When two people become one?
High high high high always high
High high, I'm always high
Is it real now?
High high, I'm always high
High high, I'm always high
When two people become one?
High high high high always high
Is it real now?

[Outro: Kerser, Empire of the Sun (Sample)]
Yeah
Fuck what you think man
When two people become one?
I'm just havin' fun with this shit
I can feel now
Everything I'm droppin's hot
Two people become one
Ha!
For the thrill
Catch me I'm falling down
Might not have nothing to do with the subject
But watch out for No Rest For The Sickest
Catch me I'm falling down
The sickest CD to come out this year
We out
Don't stop; just keep going on
Haha, Kerser
I'm your shoulder, lean upon
So come on deliver from inside
All we got is tonight that is right till first light
Is it real now?
When two people become one?
I can feel it
