[Hook]
Ti-ti-time ticks and it's going quite quick
But li-li-li-life is exactly how I write this
Ti-ti-time ticks and it's going quite quick
But li-li-li-life is exactly how I write this

[Verse 1]
Couple of stacks on clothes a week
Even though I get clothes for free
Thinking about my aim in life
Aiming high to the rainy sky
Started with nothing, watch it grow
Voice if the street, better lock and go
Do it for the ones you look down on, and put a frown on
But you out and you found a
Solid gem, call it diamond 'cause it's shining
And if I went from a siren to an island I'd be violent
But I'm out here chasing dreams, I ain't got no time to stop
A darker night just means brighter days around the block
Never stop you, chase your dream
Take it from me, you can make it clean
Idolised from state to state
Life on the line, it's make or break
Young Timmy got stabbed for an iPhone 4
Why someone take a life for an iPhone for?
Listen up now before it gets too late
All your problems escalate but you stand stall you're standing straight
Keep your head clear you got a plan to make
Move along live your life. Didn't sink in? Listen twice
'Cause I was lost and I was down but I changed my life
Hear from me, there's a way you gotta make it right

[Hook]
Ti-ti-time ticks and it's going quite quick
But li-li-li-life is exactly how I write this
Ti-ti-time ticks and it's going quite quick
But li-li-li-life is exactly how I write this

[Verse 2]
Find my goals, execute
Live life, accept the truth
Ain't no ever telling if you coming or you staying
Or you waiting or you playing on a message move
You gotta pave a way, don't you follow no one's path
Make your way, let them follow you
You ain't leaving last, gotta move
No one else can help you now if you can't help yourself
I've overcome what I won't become
But I won't be dumb and I won't be numb
Wait, I gotta be numb to ignore your feelings
So spiteful, but I've kept it real man
Hit this here, then hit the ceiling
Victory, I enjoy this feeling
Just stop, hope for the best
Hope you hear this and hope you're obsessed
Hope you don't leave, don't say that you left
Hope you're coming back and staying till your death
Is life a rollercoaster?

Ti-ti-time ticks and it's going quite quick
But li-li-li-life is exactly how I write this
Ti-ti-time ticks and it's going quite quick
But li-li-li-life is exactly how I write this
