[Intro]
Yeah
This one's for my brothers
Stracey and Shoey
Yeah, check it out

[Verse]
I woke up, punched a cone, it was eight AM
I heard some voices hit the window, I ain't playing man
Seen the coppers driven drawn, out the front and back lawn
Thinking "fuck it man, I'm gone" they screaming, lay down on the floor
I ask em "What I do?" "Where's the warrant?" "What you here for?"
They give me papers, told me that they searching, I ain't need your
Asking where the gun, from the stick up that you done
Thinking stick up eat a dick up, then they say they got my bruz
And they saying phones are tapped, I ain't needing to hear that
They put me in the cuffs, a couple knees up in my back
I say they got their story twisted, feeling like I'm in a hole
And Stracey tripping too because he fresh out and he on parol
I'm sitting at the station, in the bubble, here comes trouble
'Cause I'm next to Stracey with the Xanny, single popped a double
He looks me in the eye, no comment and we smile
And he tells me "Kerser man I'm going to be locked up for a while"
So it breaks my heart the interview, deny it all I know the go
I'm worried 'bout my brother but he marches on, he knows the flow
They ain't find shit at my house so my charges man they nothing
Big they pinning you for everything and I can't do a fucking thing
You keep your head up brother yeah that battle that's tomorrow
And we think I'm gonna miss it and he blame himself but god no
I'm a grown man brother, you ain't drag me into nothing
To this day he writes me letters saying that he feels he stuffed it
Reassure him quickly cuzzy no way will that be the case
I pleaded guilty to the charges, no way will i beat the case
Now back to when they got us and we thinking of the pitties
'Magine if I left them out the back , they probably would have shit it
And they said i can't leave Sydney, fuck that next day battle 60
Me and Ratesy we said fuck it travelled down there just to rip it
But I had you on my mind, I was stressed out over court
Payed my lawyer round four Gâ€™s just so that I could walk
They give another warning tell me this will be my last strike
I left the court to celebrate and then picked up a glass pipe
They thinking while I'm smoking this
The reason why we broke and I ain't wanna see another rock
My eyes, I keep them open
And I'm losing all my focus brother, when the fuck we turn to shit?
My bruz in prison cells and not enough to let him burn the bridge
I heard about the Shoey, I'ma try and go and see him too
But no one got his new number, I fucking hope i see him soon
I miss my fucking brothers we stay loyal to the end
That's the ABK the 225 we here until the death
I miss my fucking brothers we stay loyal to the end
That's the ABK the 225 we here until the death

[Hook]
March on, when everything falls down
Ain't no way around it, less we gonna pull the walls down
They took my brothers
The crew has just not been the same
I'm hoping if I speak today it means we gonna reach our fate
Life ain't fair, that's the cards on the street
Life ain't fair so its harder to be
A better human being but I'm trying, trying
A better human being but I'm dying dying
March on, when everything falls down
Ain't no way around it, less we gonna pull the walls down
They took my brothers
The crew has just not been the same
I'm hoping if i speak today it means we gonna reach our fate
Life ain't fair, that's the cards on the street
Life ain't fair so it's harder to be
A better human being but I'm trying, trying
A better human being but I'm dying dying
