[Intro:]
Aye yo Nebs
I think this is that flavour that's gonna
Look, (it's like) look, look

[Verse: 1]
I'm feeling smoother than ever
I'm rocking Gucci with feathers
Should see me move man I'm clever
I got the movement in cheddar
I take a 2 add some letters
Another 2 5 together
That means the crew is forever
You never knew of it better
Spitter or rapper
Just stop the chitter and chatter
Flow live a shiv in the bladder
Kicked in the fucking' door
Like I ain't even heard of Aussie Rap
Now other rappers scratch their heads
Like "Jesus Christ, what was that?"
He ain't say a barbeque or even mention politics
He did say that he wants us dead
Our baby mums can swallow dicks
It worked for him like fuckin' hell
His selling out his shows and shit
He ain't got no showman-ship
Cos he ain't gonna show men shit!
I hang around the type of cunts that stay hypin' up
They don't wanna fight for cash, they just wanna fight for blood
Do you like or love the reason why I rise above?
I'll slap your little sister down until she gets me - lighten up!

[Hook x2:]
Punchline, yeah they waitin' on that
It took me 10 damn years to create where I'm at
So if you even have a thought of ya takin' it lad
Expects a fucking avalanche to be breaking your back

[Verse: 2]
I'm crushing pills, use your pussy as a pill press
Then put a pussy on the pill, once the pill's pressed
I'm the ill yes
I'm the sickness
I'm the rapper keeping Aus alive, rappers still stressed
My price rised over a couple of months
3 massive tour, I can't even 'member the cunts
I got some boys that are loyal, they all got my back
So if you ever pop at me they gonna pop you back
Back, back, then back again
Until ya slap, trap, hacked
Then you wrapped in bin
I'm a Rap King
Half the age of what you call Rap Kings
They never want beef, they just call it a 'rap thing'
When Nebs was in jail, he was doing his stretch
I was working on the rhymes for the future I guess...

It's now x5

[Hook x2:]

[Verse: 3]
There's no effort in the shit that you do
It's quite obvious, that's why they don't listen to you!
I'm the Kers, controversial, drinking the purple
ABK, that the circle
Hater's getting murked
If I'm out of the club
I'm surrounded by cunts
So much pussy tryna touch me but I'm outta ya slut!
No times for the games, I'm strange in my brain
"04 on the train to the city again
Run a muck, back then, you could hear me flow
I've been out thinking that was almost 10 years ago!
I started from the streets, so that you know that it's real
And back then, ain't nobody gonna throw me a deal
So I got my hustle on, with the skill it was obvious
That I be running rap and I'm standing at the top of it!
There's the cocky shit
You wanted the young Kers
I could kill a motherfuckers life, in 1 verse!

[Hook x2:]

[Outro:]
What up Nebs
225 ABK
Top of this shit
Another NEBS production
You can't get beats like this
