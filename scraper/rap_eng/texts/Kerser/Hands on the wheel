[Verse 1: Kerser]
Hands on the wheel, but they barely not/
Shit even Kers is scared of Scott/
Rolling up weed shot gun, you drive/
Just popped an E, it's no wonder why/
You staring at me, so i'm staring back/
Midnight, dark scene, only wearing black/
Walking the streets I walked at 16/
Yelling "ABK, I'm back, did you miss me?"/
Sydney, go west of that/
Have a look around, its where the best is at/
Cunts gets killed for a twenty dollar bill/
Gun shots ring loud, everybody getting killed/
I'm just tryna stay real and stack the cash up/
Live, life fast like that's the mad stuff/
Back up, Kerser and Fortay/
Duck tape your mouth, you were told not to talk mate/

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fortay]
Who running this what? Public Syd blocks/
From West Syd, where cunts get shot/
Watch on the wrist goes fucking tic toc/
And your bitch will be lucky, if she sucking this cock/
New scams, moving grams/
Taking cones to the head, like I'm Gucci Mane/
Few plans to exp-and, and get the cash/
I ain't about to go out and mention that/
Any given time, I'll be with a pound/
These cunts don't rap, just queef out the mouth/
Love brings energy, hate brings drive/
Fuck all my enemies, making what's mine/
In her anal, interracial/
No beautician, but I gave the bitch a facial/
Kers and the Fort, Holdin' it down/
Hand on the wheel as I roll around/

[Verse 3]

{​Kerser}​
Got bars like brah I'm an animal/
Eating other rappers, shit 'em out like a cannibal/
New clothes, new bling makes me shine lad/
The style everybody bite and I designed that/
I stay way ahead, riding in a new car/
Hit the corner watch rims spin never lose [?]/
It's the Kers, mashed like potato/
Eyes red, off guts, do what i say hoe/
{​Fortay}​
Move when I say so, boozing the yayo/
Got me fucked up, what I do for the pay bro/
Dropping off drugs, as I cruise to a stage show/
Cock in a slut, nuts blued, then I change clothes/
Pound a smoke, while I'm counting notes/
Best pick up line, just shout 'em coke/
Take a lick, stuck thick dick, down her throat/
2 of West Syd's best, just how it goes/
Yeah
