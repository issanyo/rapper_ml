[Intro]
Oi, I'll show you a magic trick, ready?
Where the fuck did that go, cunt?

[Verse 1]
Nobody's touchin' my drink tonight
If I haven't had a drink, better pinch me twice
That shit ain't right and I take it serious
Quarter past nine AM, I'm here for this
Nice drink with a tablet too
I'm forgettin' all the shit that I have to do
Now I’m walkin' down the street with a hatchet too
And an axe and a shiv in the backpack, ooh
Smooth as but my eyes are bloodshot
Can't it be 'cause I'm high as fuck, what?
Drunk too, fuck you and your punk crew
Talkin' on my bottle like “man, I fuckin' love you”
Saw the gronk lad, I’m havin' some fun
No money, walk in, then I grab it and run
Other rappers go and make a song for the piss
I'm in a bad mood, I see you, you're coppin' a shiv

[Hook]
Abracadabra, got a magic trick (yeah)
Touch my drink and I'll slap you bitch (ha)
Touch my drink and I'll stab you quick (come on)
It's a bad habit and I have to admit
Abracadabra, got a magic trick (yeah)
Touch my drink and I'll slap you bitch (ha)
Touch my drink and I'll stab you quick (come on)
It's a bad habit and I have to admit (let's go)

[Verse 2]
Jumped up, poured a mix
Got a homeless fuck [?] shit
I forgot a little bit but I snort a stick
Beat a chat fuck with his own walkin' stick
I could have a bitch drink like a Vodka Cruiser
(Why?) 'Cause of the vodka loser
This ain't a track for you to go party to
It's a track for me to drink more [?] to
Knock at me door, I bet it's me friends
(Who's that? It's me) You got a Jim Beam ten?
I'll lock the fuckin' door unless you do
"Are you fuckin' serious?" Yes, it's true
(Come here [?]) Nah, I can't hear you
Gonna lock the door, come back with a beer dude
Greedy cunt but what? I'm addicted
One dirty habit that I'm never gonna get bitch

[Hook]
Abracadabra, got a magic trick (yeah)
Touch my drink and I'll slap you bitch (ha)
Touch my drink and I'll stab you quick (come on)
It's a bad habit and I have to admit
Abracadabra, got a magic trick (yeah)
Touch my drink and I'll slap you bitch (ha)
Touch my drink and I'll stab you quick (come on)
It's a bad habit and I have to admit (let's go)

[Verse 3]
People hate me when I get pissed
That's okay 'cause they gonna get shived
I'm a nice guy, I'm a nice g—
No I'm not, okay, that's a white lie
I settle down because I'm losing control
I gotta behave man, gotta do what I'm told
Gotta be a good man, gotta move when I’m told
But then I went and seen the fuckin' cue for the doll
What the fuck this shit? Now I pull out a knife
Grab the Centrelink bitch and I put it in twice
Everybody's screamin' "Don't stab her, no!"
So I grab that bitch and I stab her throat
Walk back to the desk, normal as fuck
Here's my form, two fortnights, yep, that's a month
Leave the scene now cunt, I'm needin' a drink
I guess we all know where I'll be in a week

[Hook]
Abracadabra, got a magic trick (yeah)
Touch my drink and I'll slap you bitch (ha)
Touch my drink and I'll stab you quick (come on)
It's a bad habit and I have to admit
Abracadabra, got a magic trick (yeah)
Touch my drink and I'll slap you bitch (ha)
Touch my drink and I'll stab you quick (come on)
It's a bad habit and I have to admit (let's go)
Abracadabra, got a magic trick (yeah)
Touch my drink and I'll slap you bitch (yeah)
Touch my drink and I'll stab you quick (yeah)
It's a bad habit and I have to admit (let's go)
Abracadabra, got a magic trick (yeah)
Touch my drink and I'll slap you bitch (ha)
Touch my drink and I'll stab you quick
It's a bad habit and I have to admit (ha)

[Outro]
Yeah
After all that shit
I went and gave me form to Cheryl
Put it through
So my pay goes in tomorrow
And um, you might not see me for a bit
'Cause I’m on a holiday
Fuck yous, ha!
