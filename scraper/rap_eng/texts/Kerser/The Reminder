[Verse 1:]
Blunt jam packed rolled by a bad bitch
She celebrating that I made it, I'ma have this
I slept way past the time that I intended
It's my day job lad, just rhyme in every sentence
From emphasine to codeine in a boost cup
Sipping on it fast, while I tell you not to do drugs
Lean back relax and yet I light this
She said she's not a slut but you should see the bitch with my dick
I'm her god, I'm her world, I'm her sunshine
She a bitch, she a girl, she ain't touch my
Money or my wallet or my phone don't call me on it
Now that's me just being honest plus your friend thinks I'ma chop her
If I didn't rap, would you still be in your panties now?
I play you "Do The Kers" but you gotta pull them panties down
Fucking slut, yeah you're making this too easy
Believe me, I'm leaving, now please enjoy your evening, goodbye

[Hook:]
You didn't learn, nah you're needing a reminder
I ain't love you once, I told you this while I'm inside you
While I'm inside you
While I'm inside you
You're just a ho, I ain't ever here to help you
Grab your shit and go 'cause I really want to belt you
Really want to belt you
Really want to belt you

[Verse 2:]
Ring my phone back, what you do that for?
Hung up straight away, 'cause she went and called me beautiful
She got the wrong idea, I ain't here to hug and kiss
I came to sip your booze and if there's time okay you suck my dick
It ain't a fucking trick, it's honest and it's down to life
I hate your name, but you fucking love the sound of mine
Kerser with a K, yeah you love it, it's insane
If they call me Scott today, she be walking other ways
That's why I treat 'em all like shit, if they fiending for my dick
No respect for a ho, groupie clear the way and split
We ain't gonna be a couple, go find your dream man
And when your with him, tell him that I already been there
I know it don't seem fair, you thinking I'm mean yeah
Well how about we change the subject go and just clean there
I'ma leave you with a fucking bruise
A reminder, like you know who you've been fucking true?

[Hook:]
You didn't learn, nah you're needing a reminder
I ain't love you once, I told you this while I'm inside you
While I'm inside you
While I'm inside you
You're just a ho, I ain't ever here to help you
Grab your shit and go 'cause I really want to belt you
Really want to belt you
Really want to belt you

[Outro:]
Yeah, and that's just being honest
So you can fucking hate me for it
But the bottom line
If you didn't see me on that stage
Or on that video clip
You wouldn't be following me everywhere chasing dick
That's why I treat you like shit
Slut
Ha ha ha, Kerser
