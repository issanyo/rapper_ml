I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
Bet this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope
Won't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the frontlines with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 1]
I'm the last hope, do it cause I can't cope
Fuckin' weird obsession gonna leave me with my heart broke
Plus last night there's three cars at my house
Dont know what they planning sittin with the lights out
Im inside, with a weapon by the front door
I could start a war and get em killed now with one call
I can't be fucked though, drama at another plan
And for all I know these people parked could be a bunch of fans
Does my fucking head in, give me fucking space
Explain it to my girl, yo we gotta get another place
Take a big breath, thats for certain
This your dream Scott, now was it worth it?
Im stressed out I got an album to make
I got a tour to do, now the hours won't wait
And I swear to god I pictured it so different if I made it
You think I really give a fuck if people there are hatin?
Bruzz

[Verse 2]
Call it what you will, rumours fly round
All these stories make me laugh as I fly down
Im a target for these people damage my name
He's a crack-head flippin' out with a fried brain
Haha, you gotta be kiddin
If the rock was my addiction would I be in this position?
I didn't think so, I'm success
I do it properly but I struggle with the fucking stress
I ain't touched a pipe in a fucking long time
Never will again, go and listen to some songs of mine
You think you know me right, the flow is tightened
Overnight, they think happend Jesus Christ this rappin' took like half my life
So take a seat back, let me roll this big spliff
On a beach with a cup of something mixed shit
Feelin' faded as, and maybe thats what makes me rap
The way I do I'm living off the fact that people play my tracks man
