[Intro]
You know I'm not an arrogant cunt but you know I run this shit ayy
(Oh yeah fucking oath)
Hey
Yeah this is Scott, sickest cunt out there
Ha ha, you dig?

[Verse 1]
Tell 'em Nebs, I ain't fucking round when in this booth
End careers if the beef is worth it you can choose
Ain't a rapper in this country done what I done
And no one helped me at the start and look how far that I've come
Cheap imitations, imitating on the greatness
That I'm making makes me switch it up on beats that Nebs is baking
They needed me to save the scene, so tell em that the saviours here
I never had to act a part a street cunt, think I made it clear
Plus my brain is not the same when the fame come
It's like the only way to get away from it is take drugs
Still I'm the greatest here, tell ya man to fall back
The raw rap in store that is selling more than raw crack
Undeniable, my rhyming skill and the swaggers hot
Plus my shit be popping they just angry 'cause you faggots not
Your missus' hands in her pants when she hears the voice
The only reason bed time comes and you think that you got her moist!

[Hook]
Running and I'm never stopping, gotta go and chase the dream
As long as I'm here breathing there is nothing they can take from me
One of a kind, yeah I'm one of a kind
And I'm never gonna stop, can't run out of time
Running and I'm never stopping gotta go and chase the dream
As long as I'm here breathing there is nothing they can take from me
One of a kind, yeah I'm one of a kind
And I'm never gonna stop, can't run out of time

[Verse 2]
Leave 'em all for dead 'cause I'm way too far ahead
When this drops check the ARIA charts, I'm there again
So confident on top of it, you rapping like the opposite
But somehow you try bite my style gronk it's just so obvious
Got back up by an army, 'cause disasters like tsunamis
Why you rapping 'bout your barbies? We make money, why we laughing?
Look at all this gold I got, rapping like it's all I got
My rapping is attacking all the acting, got the balls or not?
Didn't think so man, they watch and copy
If you gonna do that shit, try do it not as sloppy
Don't think it was a fluke, I made it man and it's pure skill
In the booth about to pop another fucking bluer pill
So who the man this year? I'm the fucking man this year
Kers one I'm the man for the next ten
Then you witness history, you looking back like thank fuck
Before our time the only reason why you gonna hate us?

[Hook]
Running and I'm never stopping gotta go and chase the dream
As long as I'm here breathing there is nothing they can take from me
One of a kind, yeah I'm one of a kind
And I'm never gonna stop, can't run out of time
Running and I'm never stopping gotta go and chase the dream
As long as I'm here breathing there is nothing they can take from me
One of a kind, yeah I'm one of a kind
And I'm never gonna stop, can't run out of time

[Verse 3]
Aussie rappers suck my dick, pull down the zip politely
This ain't a fucking trick, this rapping shit is just for my team
Tell 'em all to give it up sincerely from the sickest cunt
The same mind set as 2Pac when he wrote his shit to "Hit Em Up"
Fuck 'em all ABK UF
That's all that's left, marked for death, if they even half a step
I mean it man we ready, chop ya body to confetti
Energetic, you're pathetic, like me trying to past a medic
Cool man I rule, make 'em drool, I'm the shit son
Making 50K off a track, tell me which one
You decide you should probably suicide
If you got the choice to ride and you ain't choosing my side
You try ya best to keep up in a chokehold that's a sleeper
Make you hit the legs like when I used to hear the fucking beeper
Wit a bunch of shit dacked, trying to make some quick cash
Nowadays I sit back and make it when I spit tracks!

[Hook]
Running and I'm never stopping gotta go and chase the dream
As long as I'm here breathing there is nothing they can take from me
One of a kind, yeah I'm one of a kind
And I'm never gonna stop, can't run out of time
Running and I'm never stopping gotta go and chase the dream
As long as I'm here breathing there is nothing they can take from me
One of a kind, yeah I'm one of a kind
And I'm never gonna stop, can't run out of time

[Outro]
Yeah
This is Kerser
Government name, Scott
Sickest Cunt Out There
And I can quite comfortably say
We're running Aussie rap
This is it now, this is all that's left
Kerser, Nebs, S C O T
It's time to harden the fuck up
We found a solid jam (laughing)
Check them charts brah, we gonna bully all you motherfuckers
Me and nebs floating to the top yeah fuck
Yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo!
