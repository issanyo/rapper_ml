[Verse 1]
You didn’t have ‘em back, that was all a lie
I don’t trust no one, I'ma walk with my
Head held high everywhere I go
That’s the Kerser yo, he’s got a murderous flow
Have you heard of him bro? I don’t give a fuck
Got enough fans now, I can live it up
And you ever thought me to be one to care
I have the judge suck me off in her underwear
Came from the bottom and they copying, amazing
Same when we got ‘em and we stopped ‘em engraving
I don’t know what to with y’all
I don’t listen to the rap, I get stupid bored
Super lord, I’m a king, in fact
If I end your career, we can’t bring it back
So I’m being quite lenient, please say thank you
'Cause I got pride and my pride will break you
Ever heard of a Kers attack?
When his enemies end up in hearses act
I ain’t say too much, they call me king
If they need it sick then they call me in
That’s verse catch-up, I’m the man with this
And I speak so sick, it’s cancerous
If I ask some shit, you answer it
I’m a boss stay real, expand the shit
Came a long way, man I always say that
Gotta say that 'cause that’s a straight fact
Where I go on a land that knows me?
Everywhere I go, it’s a picture homie
Man you’re the shit, you’re the sickest bro
We pumpin’ your shit all the time and I know near
Every word to you latest, oh yeah, thanks
I appreciate it but I gotta go get high

[Hook]
I just got to get high
High when I wake up, high when I sleep
High every day that I’m able to breathe
I just got to get high
High when it’s midday, high when it’s night
High every day, it’s a part of my life
I just got to get high
High when I wake up, high when I sleep
High every day that I’m able to breathe
I just got to get high
High when it’s midday, high when it’s night
High every day, it’s a part of my life

[Verse 2]
What you wanna hear? An untouchable flow?
Every time I hit the mic, I’m in a confortable zone
Still puffin the 'dro, been around a while
The passion that I spit brings your frown to smiles
Seen a bit of shit, never tried to remember
Half of the shit 'cause my mind in a blender
Guess that’s the reason we all got a temper
ABK never known to surrender
I ain’t mentioning that, you don’t need to know
Put water on the seed and the weed will grow
But the seed was me and I blew up so mean
Didn’t use water, it had to be codeine
Oh me, am I off me head?
I didn’t right that shit, that’s what the doctor said
What I meant to do, just lie to you?
No way fuck me, I'm high as too
Lets get back on the track where the rappin’ is fat
And I’m smashing it lad since back of the cab
That single drive from Ingleburn
Stingy cunt wouldn’t risk a earn
I mean risk a loss, he’d make his pay
No discounts for ABK
I see fuck, man I miss the days
What you miss about them getting pissed again?
All the shitty trains, that we used to jump
I don’t know it’s weird, I just miss the stuff
And I’ve had enough of this shit right here
Chinese whispers in my left right ear
If I left right here would you show me love?
Got my middle finger up saying go get fucked
Oh the cunt, just let me fly
If you didn’t fuckin' know, I just wanna get high

[Hook]
I just got to get high
High when I wake up, high when I sleep
High every day that I’m able to breathe
I just got to get high
High when it’s midday, high when it’s night
High every day, it’s a part of my life
I just got to get high
High when I wake up, high when I sleep
High every day that I’m able to breathe
I just got to get high
High when it’s midday, high when it’s night
High every day, it’s a part of my life
I just got to get high
I just got to get high
