[Intro:]
Made for the shit, sluts turn to set
Told 'em what the force, Sarm, Kerser, Nebs
Made for the shit, sluts turn to set
Told 'em what the force, Sarm, Kerser, Nebs
Made for the shit, sluts turn to set
Told 'em what the force, Sarm, Kerser, Nebs
Made for the shit, sluts turn to set
Told 'em what the force, Sarm, Kerser, Nebs

[Verse 1: Kerser]
Back to basics, straight amazing, ask me bout the game I'm playing
Dreading what I've done to locks, you thinking bout it, ain't Jamaican
Kerser been the sickest probably why I'm earning digits
And they looking at your shit like rather burn it cause your bitches
Swagger like I've never seen I'm here to hurt and burn a bitch
Your shit get no views like Hustle Hard without a Kerser vid (True)
Everybody dribble and they kidding ain't it whack son?
Leave 'em injured whinging cause they toy just like a cap gun (Get it?)
No you ain't a rapper 'cause you've been inside a booth before
I bust my arse to get here and you try and make a movement more
Meaningful than mine, but that's impossible I'm made for this
And you be on my dick, pretty much just like your lady is
If I never said it then you faggots can not call it sick
Download your shit illegally, now that's what I call rawting shit
'Cause it's shit ('cause it's shit) and I'm sick
I am what is real, and you is just pretending bitch

[Interlude 1: Nebs]
It's like the more hardcore they get
It's like the shitter they rap
Bruz tone it down brah, you're not that hard
Yo, learn how to rhyme

[Verse 2: Nebs]
Fuck the antibiotics, just fill the van with narcotics
I'm the man with the chronic beats, they slam when I'm on it
Haters panties get knotted, they can't handle me rocking
Whack comments are dropping on the net I am watching
'Cause they know I'm is better, that's why Nebs a problem
'Cause they know if I see 'em, pick up a weapon and clock 'em
They looking threatened I rob 'em, give up your credit and wallet
Bend over bitch, and take the Hennessy bottle
Your not forgetting me gronkers, you had bad memories from it
That are so fucking bad, you go to therapy from it
N-E-B's honest, no fuck it N-E-B's on it
Watch me come and skull this fucking medicine bottle
I'm getting energy from it, and bruz I'm ready to vomit
I'm fucking hanging for Xannies and then I'm ready to pop 'em
My fucking head is just throbbing, my dick is red as a rocket
And your chick's already naked and she's ready to cop it, uh

[Interlude 2: Sarm]
Yeah, all these cunts are fucking fucked
They're all fucked

[Verse 3: Sarm]
Welcome, you found someone in his fucking prime
Ain't nothing to fuck with like, Wu Tang back in '95
Please excuse me guys, the shit I spit is stupid fine
Too refined, call me the priest, cause I be super fly
That was my movie line, pack your shit its moving time
If that's your chick she super fine
She sucked my dick around 2:05
Shout outs, 225
ABK, the whole crew's live
I'm on that news you high
Mess with my vibe, you'll lose at night
Yeah I'm the shit, you're just poo disguised
I do a line that's super sized
You can't rap, you're spooning guys
See it's too easy, I could do this blind
We ain't the same, I'm a ten, you're a junior nine
When I spit I'm schooling guys, it's a party schoolies time
When you spit I snooze all night
Mismatch if you choose to fight
Quit dancing your tutu's tight
You're a fake, not a new I
You just can't do this right
We'd fuck, you lose at life

[Hook:]
It's Sarm, Kerser and Nebs
We run this shit you just shit in your bed
Sick in the head, I'm sick of your head
If you's were a bitch I'd spit on your set
Fuck the whole scene it's piss in a set
Fuck your whole team it's a bitch in a dress
I'm sick and depressed that I spit with the best
'Cause they're shit and they think that they're equally fresh

[Verse 4: Kerser]
This is what they calling me, you rapping but its awkwardly
Exactly what, I was doing back around 04 or 3
So don't you try to step, yo I ain't say I'm a vet
'Cause most these veterans are faggot I'm a step ahead of them
Let 'em get at them, guarantee I'll take the head of them
Breaking both their legs and then, asking if they get it in
K-E-R-S, I put em in the ER
Nah you couldn't do it, don't you try it, its for me brah

[Verse 5: Nebs]
Mr. N-E-B, the motherfucker come and crack your lips
It's like you don't have a dick, and your raps are whack as shit
Think your fucking Rambo and your clips, fucking acting bitch
Remind me of a compact disc, pl-pl-pl-plastic shit
You are fucking hopeless as, obviously smoking shabs
And you're fucking broke as, smoking blokes for cash
Mr. Big Gun you think are the king son
But all you are to me is a busted red ring bum

[Verse 6: Sarm]
Yes, did you not hear what I said before?
Like binge thinkers, motherfucker I just rep the raw
Get out my booth, you can't rap, you just press record
Your vids suck, give it up bruz, less is more
See what your stressing for, I ain't here to lecture y'all
Someone I'm electrical, not top 10 I'm the best of all
Fuck you and your festival, no one here's impressed at all
Got a verse in Kerser's album, that equals sex for sure

[Hook:]
It's Sarm, Kerser and Nebs
We run this shit you just shit in your bed
Sick in the head, I'm sick of your head
If you's were a bitch I'd spit on your set
Fuck the whole scene it's piss
Fuck your whole team it's a bitch in a dress
I'm sick and depressed that I spit with the best
'Cause they're shit and they think that they're equally fresh
It's Sarm, Kerser and Nebs
We run this shit, you just shit in the bed
We run this shit, you just shit in the bed
Run-run this shit, you just shit in the bed
We run this shit, you just shit in the bed
Run-run this shit, you just shit in the bed
We run this shit, you just shit in the bed
Run-run this shit, you just shit in the bed
