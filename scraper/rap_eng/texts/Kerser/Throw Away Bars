I can touch your heart you just be prepared
Purer real swear to god you can see it there
If I missed and I didn't make the rap shit
Il be in a flat making 20s of a chat stick
And that's sick I ain't a sucker right
Prepare me back when I was repping hustlehard
Dropping bars in a car park dead broke
About to make it gunster new it from the get-go
I maybe wrong tho you would have to ask him
Every second track I write I put my heart in
I hit the road hard anything to spread my name
At least 9years of rap till I was getting paid
Note to other rappers put that work in
Be patient work hard that's what Kers did
These new comers think they gonna make it any set
So they rush forgetting that there's plenty seconds left
Plus they bittin me but that shit I brush it off
My first track I told the world to go and suck a cock
But that's my attitude I thankyou for your gratitude
Baby you just stop and let me show you how rap I do
So fresh so smooth let me catch your eyeball
Yeah They hate but why did I catch your eye for?
Ima maniac a genetic freak
You see the proof of this any time I get a beat
Picture 5 cunts driving with a shotgun
Chasing cash they hate cause they ain't got none
That's reality, thanks to rap tho
I got a nice way of living with the cash flow
I keep my soul kinda high in the right way
For now on aus rap is in my name
Im gonna fly away any minute hibernate
Take my soul to paradise something that my mind creates
I could die today never be alive again
Hustle from my grave before I leave I would never sign my name
Fuck the rap scene I make my own path
Cold world and the water here froze us
Was that a metaphor for you to go and work it out
Keep rewinding everytime I swear its perfect bra
I would never be the same im dealing with a heap of fame
And I don't need the radio to break your fucking speakers m8
And I preaching hate Im preaching that I reach the day
I could say Ive reached the day of my existence hey
Till that happens ild be chasing this rap shit
That's all you get for now cause im chasing the cash bitch!
