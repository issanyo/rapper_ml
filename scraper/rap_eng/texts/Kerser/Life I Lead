[Verse 1: Kerser]
Never gave a fuck but I think that it's clear
They pushed the industry away I brang the industry here
How many cunts have I proved wrong?
The same cunts that moved on
And hung the boots up 'cause they knew we were too strong
Fucking doubting us, that shit is ridiculous
If rapping was a bitch my fucking dick is stuck the clit
But what a long road we've built and what we've overcome
All these sold out shows we fucking shed our bled
Literally around 2012
Or maybe '13 I dunno it's a bit of a twirl
Suffocated by the industry we broke through the wall
And now I'm here to fucking celebrate we owning it all
They couldn't keep us down I guess the team is too strong
ABK for the record yeah the team at the top
The bottom shit we been there ain't no way we're going back
Motivation be the reason monies fucking flowing lad
Rates in the clinic, I'm in there on the visit
Trying to hide the fact that I'm tripping and I'm spinning
Yeah we really lived it, that shit is the difference
That's why we are here to catch us one and place us second
Never

[Hook 1: The Big Hustle]
Started out blacklisted
'Cause the industry, dissing me, wishing we never existed
To the point they missed it
Never thought that we could do this
Ain't a movement of a YouTube clip
And the radio don't give two shits
'Cause they can't handle [or] our true fists
Why would the ARIA's like me?
When they've never lived the things I've seen?
They discuss the type of life I will
'Cause the only difference is that I'm real

[Verse 2: Rates]
I put the work in writing music I ain't falling off
In fact I'm rising to the top you see me walking strong
Anybody who doubted me guess you all were wrong
All along we've had this certain energy in all our songs
To this day when I finish writing I'm calling Scott
Spitting him my lyrics vibing laughing it's an awesome job
The stress of trying to make it and having nothing for ages
Look at ringing my daughter like daddy's gonna be famous
It's a contradiction chasing a dream
When it's the same reason daddy's going away for a week
I guess I'm able to see different when away from the streets
But I'm still Rates I've still got this rage and it's deep
I'll take a blade to your cheek cut you 'cause you're frail or weak
Me and Kerser still make tracks every day of the week
We always kept it real hear it in the way that we speak
We hope to give em hope you fucking hate then it's beef (agh)
Fuck that you know but now I'm one to reminisce
Looking back and looking forward like they'll remember this
I've been up in the clouds we've been stuck in the ground
We've been trampled in mud these blood brothers are proud

[Hook 2: The Big Hustle]
Why would the ARIA's like me?
