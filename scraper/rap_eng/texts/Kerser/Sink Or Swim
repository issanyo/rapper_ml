[Intro]
Yeah
Smoking upto this

[Verse 1]
They were in school I was selling mix-tapes
Broke as fuck life was a mystery
Hit the bucks now they start dissing me
Let's take it back to the rest of Sydney
Eighteen livin' a dream
Around about the time that I met my queen
I struggle for this weighing more than them
On a train seventeen recording then
Tracks on the wet blew up like a monster
Made history because I made new genre
Over the addict but the kill went all
With the chady of shoes that I ever could've walk
But I didn't give a fuck because the dream was there
Thirty of us yeah the team was there
Let me take a sec I got event
Let me show you why they calling me a fucking vet
Got the best flow that you ever could've heard
The time the trip because I wasn't the nerd
Go back to the start you calling me chat
Now they hit me up for money like a balling lad
You weren't at the start on strictly day one
ABK was the shit we came from
Stick to a few comments I'm liking her
Comon wake up you are dealing with kers
Can't affect I'm the blazing type
Type write type lines insanely right
I might try fight these lines to slight
The heart my life these lines are bright
Travel around the king in town
When you rap talk they gonna try bring you down
But my head held high I'm the beast for sure
25k minimum bitches what and I'm


[Hook]
Came so far we made it bruz
Grow so high it's dangerouz
Time goes by it's saving us
Started with nothing now making us
Fresh shit blokes are staying around
Something turned to haters now
ABK came two to win
Got two options sink or swim

[Verse 2]
Round two never knew I have done this far
2008 they were laughing bruh
Why stunts so hard throw my shit off
Only with the crew when it's time to lift off
Drift off on some nice on the mic that
I'm writtin' on my life that might be and write
I'm out look to life look upto me
I look upto blue skies while I'm puffin trees
Who the fuck are we? Do you want company?
When only one in three can get trust for me
Don't make sense in the end for cunts
We used to scrape up change that's adventurous
And walk around chat cunts that meant for us
Get drunk on a train than catch a bus
But I broke that mould it was so so cold
And it won't go fold take a photo hold
Imma get you up-to date
In-case you missed out how I got here mate
Blacklisted from radio labels kept on saying no
Till I got this show my shit sell crazy
Still selling out that everybody ever make me
Still fucking bottom I'm saying it
