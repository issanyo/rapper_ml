[Intro]
So, um
I suppose this is my thank you
Look

[Verse 1]
I got that special something, I take your pain away
It feels like you been walkin' on a plank of razorblades
I know that feelin' bruh 'cause I been there too
You keep that head up, turn the shit up till they turn on you
My mate rang from lockup, told me that he's doin' fine
Last he heard for all he knows, he could be doin' nine
What the fuck I meant to say? Yeah, I'm doin' right?
And don't you ask me one more time why he was doin' crime
I got an email from a fan, he said I saved his life
But somehow mentioned I'm the reason why he blazed the pipe
So how I save him if I made him in the first place?
I wonder every day if I will make my birthday
I'm trying to save my fans, I'm walking through this fucking life
I'm trying to bring that something, they be missing something nice
You can fucking cry, just let that pain away
If you're my fan, I'll bring that sun to you on them rainy days

[Chorus]
This my thank you, thankin' you for your support
You're the reason why I made it so I owe you all
You're the reason why I wake up, I keep writin' verses
You saved me so I'm just hopin' it goes vice-versa
This my thank you, thankin' you for your support
You're the reason why I made it so I owe you all
You're the reason why I wake up, I keep writin' verses
You saved me so I'm just hopin' it goes vice-versa

[Verse 2]
To tell the truth, to go in public, need a couple tabs
Anxiety, I'm a wreck, it's gettin' fuckin' bad
I met a fan and he had tears in his eyes
He told me that my music saved him and it's clearin' his mind
And how the fuck you think I felt when he told me that I'm heaps real
For staying clean? behind the scenes, I just popped like three pills
But if I didn't pop em then we wouldn't have met
I mean I cannot go in public without poppin' them, damn
So while I ask if you being a fan
Be fan but don't look up to me, I'm fucked in the head
But you're the same so you relate and if you not then it's okay
'Cause you can tell that it's not fake, without music, I would break
Without the fans, I don't have music, so I owe you my life
I give you everything I got 'cause you know what I'm like
And it's weird, these days my mates hear my life on the tracks
So they don't bother ringing up 'cause my life in the rap trapped!

[Chorus]
This my thank you, thankin' you for your support
You're the reason why I made it so I owe you all
You're the reason why I wake up, I keep writin' verses
You saved me so I'm just hopin' it goes vice-versa
This my thank you, thankin' you for your support
You're the reason why I made it so I owe you all
You're the reason why I wake up, I keep writin' verses
You saved me so I'm just hopin' it goes vice-versa

[Verse 3]
My fans are my whole life so it kinda feels fuckin' wrong
That so many people see where I be coming from
I'll keep giving you facts on my life
Your parents hate me but I made your kid stop smashin' the pipe
I'm from the streets where my boys carry guns to get funds up
Now they in a cell, was it karma or their luck up?
Haters, shut the fuck up, you ain't live the life of mine
Until you have then you talkin', otherwise it's quite time
And people talk, man they gotta talk a lot of shit
They watch a change like the fame's what you wanted shit
Jealousy is everywhere, I'm comin' across
But if they hating, it's because I got something they want, gronks
Want stop me I'm on my way to the top
Plus I'm bringing my whole crew so it's weighin' a lot
I'm a chill, saved my fans from the trap that they're in
Kerser sayin' thank you that I actually mean, dream

[Chorus]
This my thank you, thankin' you for your support
You're the reason why I made it so I owe you all
You're the reason why I wake up, I keep writin' verses
You saved me so I'm just hopin' it goes vice-versa
This my thank you, thankin' you for your support
You're the reason why I made it so I owe you all
You're the reason why I wake up, I keep writin' verses
You saved me so I'm just hopin' it goes vice-versa
