King Kers big bizz

Got the same cold
I'm so dope that It'll
Make a fucker choke up
Kinda like me
When we got no Drugs
The flows nuts
And dope as he wrote bruz
I'm on the same shit
That had Whitney doped up
That's a joke
Why you gotta be a bum cunt
Even i worked out
That you gotta get your funds up
So buy my shit
I go with the flow
They tryna keep up
It ain't happening bro
I'm sending drugs in the mail
That've been through a blender
To no address
For the fuck of it
Return to the sender
Eating shrooms in a room
That is closing in
With my first mixtape
On the clothing bin
I'm the day 1 Kers
I'm the special meal
And not gonna give a fuck
About no record deal
Probably my Pri-ority
Will be if I
Got to eat 50 Pingas in a night
I might die, honestly
But i'm outta the boom
I spit from way outside
You get a louder view
I mean louder sound
I need powder now
I've been down and out
She been round and round
But she heading back my way
I'm talking 'bout this rap shit
You don't enjoy the sound
You can gobble up a fat dick

[Verse 2]
Look
I got big plan
Big plans like a big plant
Growing at you mothers house
Chop it when the shit flares
My brain's gone
It really is lost
No reward for the shit
I won't cover the cost
You gotta love my I'm boss
I let none of them cross
Even reach where I'm at
It's no wonder your lost
See me running from cops
With the bud from the cops
I got a way of tripping out
When the running is stopped
I'm on the way of some tablets
Turning into magic
Turning into tragic
I'm back it's fantastic
Kers 1 brah
Really the king
Every street in the Aus
Is fucking feeling this shit
And we gone ride till the end
We make them beep us
You say you gonna take a shot
Fucking leap up
A true king
Always setting the bar
And you so so lost
You get left where you are
King Kers
I waste a bar
Poppin' pills
I'm wasted brah
This easy, breezy
They cheesy
We make hits
It's all ours
And we greedy
Smoke a sesh
Get depressed
Let me lift you up
Nightmare Kerser 1
Got the pistol tucked
I'm out running marks
On another land
Gonna need some pills
So someone call my Brother man
