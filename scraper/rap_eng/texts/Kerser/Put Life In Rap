[Verse 1]
Take it back guess theres certain shit you cannot
I thought some people had my back but they ran off
Hope you get the message that I'm sending across
Thought i knew where I was heading but I ended up lost
In the maze of the rap game its kinda like the crack game
Backstage chilling and somebody seen a strap, man
Why me why they worry what the Kers do
My rapping help so much that if I ever stop it hurts you
You won't admit that, you'll get you own chin tat
Saying that you'll shoot but didn't know the shotty kicks back
My phones tapped hope they listening close
Cos if I'm ever planning shit I won't admit it on phones
I never answer private numbers till my boys do the stretch
Keep my money on the books cos I am loyal to death
Still made it in the country had no radio yet
But I'll probably be the reason for the radio's death
Deadset

[Hook]
I don't wanna be the one
To break down and fall I'm reaching up
But I work so hard put life in rap
That equals cash and jealousy and knives in backs
And I just don't know if raps the same
Filled with fake gronks I never wanna rap again
I tried to say this shit yeah I did my best
No matter what real raps living in my flesh

[Verse 2]
Is it wrong I get a buzz when I show off my shit?
Pulling up in my car like you know what it is
Years ago they'd laugh, I was poor like dead broke
Then I got paid won't forget what they said, no
Driving in the fast lane, thinking bout my past man
Almost got trapped seeing life through the glass aye
Now I'm clean but I still smoke weed
Pop pills sometimes and still sip my lean
Used to get my ink by a cunt on the nod
And if we wanted more tats we would buy em a shot
Grow up round the block that a normal thing
You live a sheltered fucking life and ignore the shit
If you seen what I seen then likely you might be
Hearing what I'm saying do it day and do it nightly
We lived a different life mine did a 180
And my price is going up saying hi and pay me
Baby

[Hook]
I don't wanna be the one
To break down and fall I'm reaching up
But I work so hard put life in rap
That equals cash and jealousy and knifes in backs
And I just don't know if raps the same
Filled with fake gronks I never wanna rap again
I tried to say this shit yeah I did my best
No matter what real raps living in my flesh

[Verse 3]
This is me, this the truth its real
Got the rap, got the look and the street appeal
You meet fuckers like me hardly every in life
Since I dropped my first shit
I've been deadin' the mic
You should look into my eyes
See the truth the realness they feel this
I ain't gotta reveal shit
Its getting hard to stay real for all the fans
Cos the coppers listen to, they wanna shut down my plan
Tell the unders to fuck off I'm getting bundles I love us
And I ain't ever gonna stop from getting money I love it
So if I come in adumage that means I wasn't 100% in what
I told my missus so I'm not gonna fuck it
I've spent a lot my money on shit I got it I'm honestly sick
And its even better cos I know what the poverty is
So let me vibe out smoke a joint and lie down
Thinking bout my life wow is this really mine now?

[Hook]
I don't wanna be the one
To break down and fall I'm reaching up
But I work so hard put life in rap
That equals cash and jealousy and knifes in backs
And I just don't know if raps the same
Filled with fake gronks I never wanna rap again
I tried to say this shit yeah I did my best
No matter what real raps living in my flesh
