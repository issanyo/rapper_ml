[Verse 1]
Room shakes and I’m walking around
Can't even tell, am I talking talking out loud?
You mix that mushroom with that eccy
Mix that rum soon with that Pepsi
Mix that, uh, you come, you met me
Bitch had fuck, you tried to impress me
But I walk to the V.I.P
Free grog roped off feeling B.I.G
Nebs' beats worth more then your whole life
And, with my voice, they double in price
From poor to rich, I’m raw as shit
One flick of the finger and my balls get licked
Then it's party time, come and party right
Lines so bigger than Charlie mind
Big fat lines like the ones I write
This that rhyme that will fuck em, why?!

[Pre-Hook]
All night long, tell em all night long
I'ma get so fucked, you don’t know what on
I'ma stand for this, this the anthem bitch
Your bitch over there, look who she's dance-dance-dancing with

[Hook]
Put 'em up in the air, get em up now
Fuck a slut right there, hit her up now
Anywhere, don’t care, fuck the club up
With my crew, motherfucker what the fuck's up?
Put 'em up in the air, get em up now
Fuck a slut right there, hit her up now
Anywhere, don’t care, fuck the club up
With my crew, motherfucker what the fuck's up?

[Verse 2]
Mushy moo, Mushy moo, woo woo
What was that? I dunno what I do
Am I there? Are you there? Who that?
Mushrooms, a few lad
Eccys new batch
Sick cunt, true fact
I live the way you wish for
That's probably why you diss or
No fan base, man you're piss poor
My fans took over this shore
I can rhyme this no effort
Still top the charts, the freshest
Come on now say this saint's real
I’ll get you killed be grateful
I seen those streets I made it
Me on these beats create it

[Pre-Hook]
All night long, tell em all night long
I'ma get so fucked, you don’t know what on
I'ma stand for this, this the anthem bitch
Your bitch over there, look who she's dance-dance-dancing with

[Hook]
Put 'em up in the air, get em up now
Fuck a slut right there, hit her up now
Anywhere, don’t care, fuck the club up
With my crew, motherfucker what the fuck's up?
Put 'em up in the air, get em up now
Fuck a slut right there, hit her up now
Anywhere, don’t care, fuck the club up
With my crew, motherfucker what the fuck's up?

[Verse 3]
Verse three, yeah they heard of me
Murder beats and be I'ma swerve with lean tonight
Me no way man I’m needing a lift
Some dumb fuck heard and they hand me a lift
I’m like what the fuck better top that up
With the ecstasy, got me bopping cuz
Now I rack that line and I smack that spine
'Til that slut can’t walk, shit that's fucked I’m
Leaving this place I ain't needing a date
In court no way so I’m leaving okay
They're like "Don’t leave Kers man, we need you here"
I think I need to calm down with a weed and beer
No way I said, all night okecay
Not okay, talk in slang like okecay
Still don’t get pig latin, okay
Fucking dumb cunts, scream it, cocaine!

[Pre-Hook]
All night long, tell em all night long
I'ma get so fucked, you don’t know what on
I'ma stand for this, this the anthem bitch
Your bitch over there, look who she's dance-dance-dancing with

[Hook]
Put 'em up in the air, get em up now
Fuck a slut right there, hit her up now
Anywhere, don’t care, fuck the club up
With my crew, motherfucker what the fuck's up?
Put 'em up in the air, get em up now
Fuck a slut right there, hit her up now
Anywhere, don’t care, fuck the club up
With my crew, motherfucker what the fuck's up?
