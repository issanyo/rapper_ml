[Intro]
Yeah
This is motivational music
I mean I want you to get here too
Check

[Verse 1]
Okay, now I made it, I wonder if I trust you
Driving from the beach blowing weed out the sunroof
Got ‘em trippin’ out like they eatin’ on mushrooms
That’s the impact of my rhymes, it’s a rush true
I make you hair stand and a shiver on your spine too
Gift of the gab, yeah I got that times two
I knew I use the law of attraction
With a lot of talent mixed, man of course it would happen
On my way to the bank where my card would bounce
To walkin' into that shit to get a large amount
You can ask around, I never stop with the rap
There’s the answer if you wonder why I got it like that
I really live for the shit, don’t you try and compare
Another rapper to Kers, I got a style too rare
So when you see me keep the energy, don’t care if you’re an enemy
There’s no way in this life that you will ever see the end of me

[Hook]
I hustled it the right way, on another flight mate
Heading to my state to rock a show with my five-eights
This is it, this the shit that I made true
Blood, sweat and tears first to do it hope you grateful
I hustled it the right way, on another flight mate
Heading to my state to rock a show with my five-eights
This is it, this the shit that I made true
Blood, sweat and tears first to do it hope you grateful

[Verse 2]
My albums are treasures that I’m happy you found
Through all my career, I been what’s happening now
From the back of the crowd, to the front of the shit
I spilled my life on the stage, I got you loving the kid
It’s like I can’t do wrong, I move onto the next move
Got a couple shooters that are waiting on my text, true
I let loose, but these memories flash back
Of Tooheys new Winnies filled up in my backpack
Running from the five-O, hearin’ them smash lads
Screaming at the dogs “who you trying catch fag?”
They’re smashing their cars, we had a war of the cunts
Thank fuck I fought the case, the judge tore it all up
Pieces of my life, man I’m givin' you that real
Coincidence this the night the riots in Mac Fields
Started so they gave up and headed to Mac
We was in [?] sixteen, probably toking on crack, it’s whack

[Hook]
I hustled it the right way, on another flight mate
Heading to my state to rock a show with my five-eights
This is it, this the shit that I made true
Blood, sweat and tears first to do it hope you grateful
I hustled it the right way, on another flight mate
Heading to my state to rock a show with my five-eights
This is it, this the shit that I made true
Blood, sweat and tears first to do it hope you grateful

[Verse 3]
Let’s get deeper in the track, take you deeper in the rap
Pop a sleeper, have a nap, wake up dreaming in the back
Of my own whip, but who the fuck driving the shit?
They said not me 'cause I’d be colliding like…
Fuck it though I’m ready, everything I do phenomenal
I got ‘em all waitin' on my next shit to drop just to drop in stores
Let’s get back to what you’re here for
You only here 'cause you fuckin' wanna hear more
Paranoid yeah, here we go a-fucking-gain
Time to sit me down and tell me something’s different with my brain
I won’t listen, they insane, try and switch that on my plate
While I’m sittin' with my mate and he’s flickin’ on a blade, shit
Nothing changed but my house and a paycheck
And my car and my jewels and I’m famous
In my brain, I’m the same, I’m a blessed one
After Kers, we won’t never see a next up
We the first from the street to hit the major stage
Since a kid, I’ve been reppin' with the ABK
You take a fall you getting up, that’s what a man do
I’m the Kers, the one the industry can’t handle
Everyone biting, just remember the original
The three lines on the side that was rippin’ you
You can’t blow up off your own shit and it hurts brah
But don’t deny it if you’re influenced by Kerser

[Hook]
I hustled it the right way, on another flight mate
Heading to my state to rock a show with my five-eights
This is it, this the shit that I made true
Blood, sweat and tears first to do it hope you grateful
I hustled it the right way, on another flight mate
Heading to my state to rock a show with my five-eights
This is it, this the shit that I made true
Blood, sweat and tears first to do it hope you grateful
I hustled it the right way, on another flight mate
Heading to my state to rock a show with my five-eights
Blood, sweat and tears
