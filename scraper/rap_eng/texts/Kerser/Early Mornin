[Verse 1]
They talking about skill, let me drop it on the head
They talking about pills, let me pop em till im dead
I'm the curse of the shit that means words that i writ, now take you back in time to my earliest shit
When i drop my mixtape yeah they try to ignore
When they cop the shit it's great now they try to applause
I ain't here for you to dick ride, cos I spit the sick rhymes
See my in my clique light up getting rich
I won't stop till I'm claiming it all
I've be warned its gonna hurt, will I remain in this form?
Stand in the depths not a chance of it yet not yet man or ever imma dance till the death
I'm the man with the shit but im loosing my brain
10 years strong only the truest remain
Oh you need a couple facts? Check the charts when my shit drops!
I'm doing this for us, thats a trust - FUCK HIP-HOP!

[Hook] x2
Cos I'm up till the early morning
Writing these rhymes same day I record them
Need a brake that's what they keep telling me
Still the same Kers looking for a felony

[Verse 2]
You say I changed like way to much
I haven't changed once so wait you cunt
I mean I got a lot fresher when I got a fucking cash flow
That's no joke, blow smoke watch the ash, though
This is my whip yeah I bought it out-right
They used to say I was broke yeah now try!
Mother fucker I can hustle my shit
Snowy mountains if I cum on your tits
Let me get into the shit no-one do it like me
That's why you so damn attached it's the truth when I speak
An you watch me rise up, climb up and ride up
Thanking my fans every track I'm your life brah
Cos I'm here I ain't ever going no where
But if they get me killing me back man you better swear
I ain't scared I'm prepared for the future
So many haters, lets see if they shoot brah

[Hook] x2
Cos I'm up till the early morning
Writing these rhymes same day I record them
Need a brake that's what they keep telling me
Still the same Kers looking for a felony

[Verse 3]
We ain't ever gonna leave, we ain't leaving
This is spare time crush your chest you breathing
I ain't wanna hear all the shit they talk 'bout
Room full of rappers? Then fuck it man I'm walking out
I ain't wanna hear about your next CD
Unless I'm riding with you, otherwise leave me
I'm in my own zone standing on the top of shit
Once a month for 4 years I've been dropping hits
That includes albums every year too
Fuck a hater I can see shit with a clear view
An they told me chill why you always angry man
Cos you hated now you back here as a fucking fan
What am I meant to do welcome you back
You doubted at first I should belt you for that
Only joking man a fan is a fucking fan
Support me I got you I'm the fucking man (im the fucking man x4)

[Hook] x4
Cos I'm up till the early morning
Writing these rhymes same day I record them
Need a brake that's what they keep telling me
Still the same Kers looking for a felony
