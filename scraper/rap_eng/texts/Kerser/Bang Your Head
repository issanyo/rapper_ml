[Intro: Kerser]
Yeah
Sarm, Nebs
Kerser
That's Them

[Verse 1: Sarm]
Yeah, it's Sarm, Kerser and Nebs
We run this shit you just shit in your bed
Sick in the head? I'm sick of your head
If you's were a bitch, I'd spit on your set
Fuck the whole scene it's missing a set
Fuck your whole team it's a bitch in a dress
I'm sick and depressed that I spit with the best
'Cause they're shit and they think that they're equally fresh
Now, could you sit in your meds
'Cause I'm jumping on beats with the speakers all messed
Speak like a creature of death
You talk shit 'cause [?] breath
Fuck you learners [?] the test
Me, straight serving [?]
Yes, always serving the west
Know who it is? Sarm, Kerser and Nebs

[Hook:]
Break-break your necks-necks
We run this shit, we're the best-best
Who do know that can test-test
Sarm one, Kerser and Nebs-Nebs?
Bang-bang your heads-heads
We run this shit, we're the best-best
Who do know that can test-test
Sarm one, Kerser and Nebs-Nebs?

[Verse 2: Kerser]
Chainsaw revving, I ain't putting it down
Come one, talk that shit with a foot in your mouth
Look at the ground, don't look at my eye
When you're going to talk shit, you get hooked with [?]
Never talk back, we run this shit
And you's turn bitch after one big hit
Come see bitch witness with sick
You can see a few self, we spit and hit
The heights that they dream of, biting my team
Always got a copy 'cause you finding we keep on
A higher level shit that we do
And the level that we on is different to you
Punch you in the face, I'm [?]
Can't fuck around, cunts burn your chest
Made for the shit, sluts turn to set
Told 'em what the force, Sarm, Kerser and Nebs

[Hook:]
Break-break your necks-necks
We run this shit, we're the best-best
Who do know that can test-test
Sarm one, Kerser and Nebs-Nebs?
Bang-bang your heads-heads
We run this shit, we're the best-best
Who do know that can test-test
Sarm one, Kerser and Nebs-Nebs?

[Verse 3: Nebs]
