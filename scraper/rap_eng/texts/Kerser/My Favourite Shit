[Verse 1]
Uh
Im ridin’ through Sydney
Im with ma crew
And we keep hearing stories
What they gon’ do (Huh?)

What they gon’ do
But people be talking a whole lotta shit
And I'm waiting on them
To go make a there move (come on then)
Make a there move (fucken wanker)
Make a there move
I play with these bitches its easy to see
That they jealous
And they want to be what I am (kerser)
Be what I am (sickest)
Be what I am
They cannot keep up with the skill that im droppin’
If they think they are
Let’s see if they can (dreamin)
See if they can (let’s watch it)
See if they can
You twitchin’ and turnin’
And think that you earnin’
Until we rock up man
You gon’ look at this cash (stacks)
Look at this cash (look)
Look at this cash
They comin’ to get me
I'm calling their bluff
Cause if they fuck around
Then they would’ve got bashed (ewhh)
Would’ve got bashed (ewhh)
Would’ve got bashed
My boys a got guns
And mah boys a got knives
And they’ll take you alive
I'm not saying it twice (shh)
Saying it twice (haha)
Saying it twice
I'm comin’ to get ‘em
I wonder what’s hurt them
But they keep on cryin’
Like can’t you be nice? (ouhh)
Can’t you be nice? (come on man)
Can’t you be nice?

[Hook (x2)]
Smokin’ green, Makin’ money, That’s my favourite shit (favourite shit)
What you mean, Take it from me, That’s some crazy shit (crazy shit)
We livin’ different lives, You ain't about what we about
What we about, make money, sippin purple then I'm leanin’ out

[Verse 2: Kerser]
I'm sippin on purple
I'm smokin’ a spliff
And I'm wearin’ all Gucci
Like look at me now (fresh)
Look at me now (so fuckin' fresh)
Look at me now
You talkin’ all this
And you talkin’ all that
But I tend to think that’s only cause you can rap (come on)
Cause you can rap (be truthful)
Cause you can rap
I mean what I say
And I say what I mean
So if you’re steppin’ up
You got rocks in your head (dipshit)
Rocks in your head (dropkick)
Rocks in your head
I'm willin’ to bet
That these rappers are soft
And if we threaten them
They’ll be off to the feds (dog)
Off to the feds (staunch)
Off to the feds
I'm rollin’ around
In my city so greedy
With bitches that flickin’ and lickin’ they tit (slut)
Lickin’ they tit (lowie)
Lickin’ they tit
Another betrayel
And we cuttin’ your head off
No time for these snakes
And no time for these bitches (nuh)
No time for these bitches (fuck off)
No time for these bitches
Money to make
And I'm makin’ the cash
I fall back with the rap
Cause I'm taken it back (it’s mine)
Taken it back (later)
Taken it back

[Hook (x2)]
Smokin’ green, Makin’ money, That’s my favourite shit (favourite shit)
What you mean, Take it from me, That’s some crazy shit (crazy shit)
We livin’ different lives, You ain't about what we about
What we about, make money, sippin purple then I'm leanin’ out
