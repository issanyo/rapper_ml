[Intro: Nebs & Kerser]
Thanks bruz
Yo, um
All right, if you're on LSD, you need to get the fuck out
'Cause we're gonna spin you the fuck out
You in the V-neck – fuck out!
Get the fuck out! Right in your face cunt
Ayo Kerser

[Verse 1: Kerser]
I'll fuck a fake in the face with the face of a fake
Then I'm takin' away what they claim in this haze
Kerser one, you know the name, I got you readin' riches
Why I'm feedin' pimples, eatin' meat and missiles
Shut your mouth, I got it ready, you can say I've nearly cooked rap
We up in Campbelltown so just be careful who you look at
Puffin' the chronic, ain't it fuckin' ironic?
I see a muffin, I'm on it, I got her up on the bonnet

[Verse 2: Nebs]
You cop a punch to the stomach, cough up your lunch and your vomit
Honest rappers shit the gear like there's a gun and I cocked it
I make ‘em leave you proper lone and start becomin' a Gothic
Now they're on some emo shit, no more Muph & Plutonic
I straight piss in your pocket, you need to summon the prophet
You need to run to Mohammed, you claim you're tough and you rob it
But you're the one that’s just dobbing, there's a bit of a problem
You're like thirty years of age and you get fucked up the covet

[Verse 3: Kerser]
I’m the lad that they talkin' 'bout in good ways and bad ways
Look mate, it's mad ayy, I took 'way your sad face
Battle rap shit, yeah I’m dyin' to be goin' at
Promotors say it’s hard to find me an opponent, but
Ain’t this cunt sayin' that they raisin’ the bar?
Call 'em out, duck and weave, I be suckin' the weed
My attitude stays mate, they ain’t nothin' to me
Yeah, I’m somethin' to see like I’m one off the beat

[Verse 4: Nebs]
And then you run to police because you runnin' from me
Put the noose around your neck lad and jump from the tree
If hoes are constipated like a junkie on the gear
When it comes to lovin' man, you love it in the rear
If you want a real show, I’m just a phone call away
Right, we set 'em up on stage and I blow you all away
It's like I’m throwin' a grenade at the stage when I play
You knew the shit was hectic when I wrote it on the page, uh

[Outro: Nebs & Kerser]
Yeah, warn 'em 'bout the soup
Um, there's some soup in the kitchen
Um, if it makes you feel drowsy or anything like that
Don't drive a motor vehicle or operate any machinery
And then fuck the clowns with the skinny jeans
And now shit their pants and they're gone
Oh, yeah, another warning
I put some Valium in the punch
And fuck it, I'm just gon' say it
If anyone's got that mature porn, seventy plus shit
[?] to it
We out
Bitches
