[Verse 1: Kerser]
Here's a new fact, I make your fuckin' crew collapse
They gon' call it true rap 'cause it's over boom bap
Well, why you do that? They say I gotta thirsty mind
I gotta slow down reason for the purple sprite
Any style, it's been proven I kill
Your bitch want to do to me what I do to a pill, I'm ill
Plus only fans see where the fuck I'm coming from
Moving units, major labels, thinking something's wrong
Yes yes, it is true, I get hated, but I get paid a lot
Just must mean I made it gronk, the raw rap that can split 'em in half
If music was a slut, I got my fucking dick in her arse
Plus I'm hitting it fast, no hands in the driver seat
No breaks, pop pills as I'm lighting the weed
Fresh shirt rockin' with the hat to match
I'm getting head racking lines in a taxi cab, and that's a wrap

[Hook: Kerser]
Let me hit my spliff tonight
Eyes half closed red, screaming this the life
Stand out from the pack with a different mind
Serving up the rap, you can get in line
Let me hit my spliff tonight
Eyes half closed red, screaming this the life
Stand out from the pack with a different mind
Serving up the rap, you can get in line

[Verse 2: Jay UF]
Let me hit my spliff tonight
Then hit the mic and bring on back a different kind of fucking shit you like
The next in line to progress, mess your frickin' mind
Yes, you guessed it right, I'm next to climb while I spit the freshest I've
Ever spat before, sure you can try ignore the signs
But truth be told I'm walking right towards a life I ought to find
I slaughter rhymes whenever aiming at my target
'Cause I'm sort of like a sword when I can't wait to rip apart shit
Hated by so many fools, they listen and they like me
Turnin' crazy like some cannibals just wishin' they could bite me
But uh-uh, I made a flow and they should know the go now
This ain't a race, but way too late for me to fucking slow down
I came to make the best and take my fate and I ain't giving up
It's Jay UF, and, yes, I changed my name and I don't give a fuck
It's all the same, same face, abnormal brain. It's simple bruz
The only Jay you today with Ratesy and the sickest cunt

[Hook: Kerser]
Let me hit my spliff tonight
Eyes half closed red, screaming this the life
Stand out from the pack with a different mind
Serving up the rap, you can get in line
Let me hit my spliff tonight
Eyes half closed red, screaming this the life
Stand out from the pack with a different mind
Serving up the rap, you can get in line

[Verse 3: Kerser]
Enemies appear 'cause I'm sitting at the top spot
People everywhere are thinking why I haven't got shot
I'm making music if I'm not on the road then
I chase the dream I'm making sure that it won't end
At a mate's place off my face
Talking bout the days, thinking how a lot has changed
But I gotta keep moving 'cause you only get one shot
Fingers in the air, tell 'em all they can fuck off
Crazy world, Imma paint the picture perfect
Words so explicit that I burn your eye's surface
It's so easy, smash 'em all 'cause they lame kid
We stand out 'cause everybody do the same shit
So real in a scene that's fake
Take away can't rest no sleep today
I am the truth in a dream and they telling me it's real life
I made my world change, I can't explain what that feels like

[Hook: Kerser]
Let me hit my spliff tonight
Eyes half closed red, screaming this the life
Stand out from the pack with a different mind
Serving up the rap, you can get in line
Let me hit my spliff tonight
Eyes half closed red, screaming this the life
Stand out from the pack with a different mind
Serving up the rap, you can get in line
