[Verse 1]
Kick it off now, got the outro
One shout-out to the cunts who doubt bro
Proved 'em wrong but still they hate
Couldn't have done better, I'm real they fake
And I heard 'em ask if I beef with cunts
No beef, I'm just too far in front
If that cause beef then so be it
Stop asking if I'm sober yet
I'm over it, go ten for ten
Seen the closest mates turn greedy man
And that's enough when I cut you off
Then they all call back like "I love you Scott"
I've seen two sides, if I quit the rap
Pretty sure you wouldn't be ringin' back
Everyone around me wantin' something
What you do for me? You do fuckin' nothing
Shout to the crew though, always on the move bro
One main rule I'll never ever lose yo
Gotta say my rap, my life
Everything I've sacrificed
Everything I have, I tried
Non stop work, rap has my life
But I'll stay here, for my fans, for my fam and for my friends
Until the end I'll be the Kers
Always here to feed a verse
Feels like that like every day
Covered everything, what's left to say?
I just wanna be like left alone
Can't end up in a mental home
Been chasing my dreams for half my life
Now I'm waiting for the part where I die

[Hook]
This the way it goes, be patient, let me break it down
Done a couple things I'm never gonna say out loud
Thank you all the crew that got my back
They knew from my first rap there's no stopping that
This the way it goes, be patient, let me break it down
Done a couple things I'm never gonna say out loud
Thank you all the crew that got my back
They knew from my first rap there's no stopping that

[Verse 2]
Steppin' up shit every time I drop
That's the main reason they kind to Scott
And I'm kinda lost but I find a way
Thinkin' "I'm ahead should I hide away?"
I'm gonna lose patience, time me lad
I don't even wanna write another rhyme with that
I want a clear mind, it's all I want
But everyone's dramas fall on Scott
And I'm sitting in the back like what is what?
Thinking should I just call it off?
But I came so far, too far to quit
I'll write another rhyme and ask you this
If you were me, what would you do?
Would you get personal when they write a review?
Piss on these rappers that doubted you?
Would you get a clear mind from a clouded view?
I'm losing my mind, when I rhyme I don't choose a side
Ready to make career suicide
Dunno what to do, I'll cruise all right
Shout to the fans, you pull me through
Shout to the haters, I'm hurting you
Ain't no tellin' what Kerser do
Last thing that you wanted was me verse you
But I'm lucky as fuck, I got my girl
And she makes sure that Scott's her world
And that shit there, that helps me heaps
More than any other one helping me
Walk a tightrope, don't slip and fall
And with hip hop I give my all
Album five, I'm signin' out
Until next time, all right, we out

[Hook]
This the way it goes, be patient, let me break it down
Done a couple things I'm never gonna say out loud
Thank you all the crew that got my back
They knew from my first rap there's no stopping that
This the way it goes, be patient, let me break it down
Done a couple things I'm never gonna say out loud
Thank you all the crew that got my back
They knew from my first rap there's no stopping that
