[Hook]
We have gone away
I think these times'll be replaced
I am never past
I'll make this last until I break

[Verse 1]
Rainy days ain't a challenge for me no more
I ain't know most these rappers, they just don't talk
I broke records, made money thenthey treat me funny
Weird cycle, keep it movin', they can't teach me nothin'
City range train stretched out of C-Town
Jigged school and get lost in the weed clouds
Then hit the shops, we was dackin' D12 then
Now the most racked album in this whole land
Is the Kers, ain't that trippy as fuck?
I can't blame the kids now when I was rippin' the stuff
Bro, I'm the one they said would never, ever make it
And I did, that's why I rub it in their faces
Dropped the greatest catalogue the scene has seen
I don't know how I made it, I'm just bein' me
I'm a weapon, ain't need no one by my fuckin' side
That's just a bonus, I'm a hustler, I fuckin' grind

[Hook]
We have gone away
I think these times'll be replaced
I am never past
I'll make this last until I break

[Post-Hook]
It's different went I roll through, it's different when the Kers here
I take away your pain, I got a way for you to burn tears
Still on top till the day that I quit
And even then, they won't stop, they'll keep playin' my shit

[Verse 2]
Thursday nights at MacArthur Square
Around when I was sixteen, that's the spot, it was there
Before they done it all up, cunts was runnin' amok
No social media but these are all times of the past
I'm bringin' memories, I'm makin' sure that they live on
Give you shivers if you lived it, it's your best song
Copper chases, yellin' "run, run, run"
I had a target on my back, I found it fun, fun, fun
Now I'm livin' so different, paid from a rap tune
You don't need to respect it man, you have to
Reppin' ABK, Jesus, even back then
From the era, makin' flowies out of black pens
That's the writers, now let me shout the hustlers
The ones who had the whole town as their customers
You'd see your mate gettin' on at the same time
This when crews was stabbin' cunts on the train line

[Hook]
We have gone away
I think these times'll be replaced
I am never past
I'll make this last until I break

[Post-Hook]
It's different went I roll through, it's different when the Kers here
I take away your pain, I got a way for you to burn tears
Still on top till the day that I quit
And even then, they won't stop, they'll keep playin' my shit
