[Intro]
Yeah, this is Kerser, now um
You're about to learn the new dance craze that's taking the world by storm
And all the bitches are doing it
Everywhere you go and it's called the Kers

[Verse 1]
So you know what I do in a verse
This is different, I'ma teach you how you're doing the Kers
You got your left foot in you got your left foot out
You got the right hand up you got the right hand down
Ya take a little step forward then you're doing the twirl
That's for the fellas now please, we get to the girls
You get your hands on your hips then shaking your tits
You shake that arse, shake your tits til your breaking your ribs
You gotta, stand straight, readjust you clothes
Take a step to the left then you touch your toes
It's the Kers, do the Kers, doing it club to club
And the gutter motherfuckers do it pub to pub
I'ma crack the speakers and attack the feature
If you motherfuckers even try the Macarena
It's the new shit, exclusive, the moves that work
All my fellas and my bitches come and do the Kers

[Hook]
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Till it hurts bitch; till it, till it hurts bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Till it hurts bitch; till it, till it hurts bitch

[Verse 2]
This is easy, dance shit, chuck it back
I dance at gigs, no need for me to fucking rap
Front to back, yeah they doing the Kers
I got the fellas bopping round, the bitches losing their skirts
I got the guards at the door and they asking for more
When Kerser's in the fucking club it's never hard to score
So if they laugh at ya'll just stop and do the Kers bitch
Play this song fifty million times until you learn it
It's the new thing; you stand aside you're missing out
You really wanna be the lost cunt asking 'what's this about'?
I didn't think so, grab another drink ho
Place your thumb and your index on your big toe
I'm charging lessons if you struggle to learn
Sorry love, you're a fat slut, a bubble to burst
You don't want trouble with Kers
We getting down with the movement
Now we can do it, uh come on, move it

[Hook]
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Till it hurts bitch; till it, till it hurts bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Till it hurts bitch; till it, till it hurts bitch

[Verse 3]
I got pensioners busting, doing Kers on the bus
They can't help it man they have to 'cause it hurts but they must
Be down with the new phase, nothing you can do mate
Ice Fein's busting out the Kers for like two days
Straight no sleep, a slayer with no peak
If you don't believe it's taking off you better go see
I'm on a stage and I'm doing the Kers lad
I'm in a rage so I'm doing a purse snatch
That's irrelevant; I know I gotta get on track
Yeah girl, on your knees then you bend your back
Send em back if they asking where the Kers at
Complete strangers like "damn I wanna learn that"
It's real simple; I'm like Timberlake and Usher
Well if they didn't sing and they weren't no cocksuckers
Blockbuster, I'm something you can't miss
So do the Kers while you're shaking that arse bitch

[Hook]
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Till it hurts bitch; till it, till it hurts bitch
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Till it hurts bitch; till it, till it hurts bitch

[Outro]
Yeah, so um, all the ladies that can't dance
Don't sweat it, you can still come see me and do the Kers
Do the Kers bitch; do the, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Do the Kers bitch, do the Kers bitch
Till it hurts bitch; till it, till it hurts bitch
