Didn't we just drop an album nebs?

Another album drop put that where the classics at
How many times we gotta prove we got that magic rap
Caught up in the money, everybody turnin' on me
I thought everybody proud 'til everybody want it from me
It's a funny thing I tell ya', I seen everybody dirty
Favour after favour never nothin' in return and
It ain't even like I'm askin' im just waitin' on a thank you
Your sussin' out my money, that ain't somethin' that a mate do
I bet it breaks you, I'm stackin' up I'm holdin' bricks
I learnt my lesson keep it separate never told 'em shit
Still ridin' with my girl, got her decked out in that louis too
Cause she was there when i was poor, look where we're movin' to
Water out the back, feel like swimmin' til i drown lads
6 bedroom house and I started in a town house
I got it down lad, i make my dreams come true
You stabbed my back, now you wishin' you could come too
Visit to see Sero but they had him on a box visit
He touched the glass and told me dont you ever stop wit it
He said "fuck 'em all" kinda like he read my thoughts
I could say a million things that we've both said before
He rang me up the other day, dialing me
He cracked a joke, the first time he's smiled in weeks
He knows i miss him on the truest we speech
Plus now the crew is getting pumped up for Shue's release

I'm waking up stressed, shit you talk about a workload
Holdin' on my money, ain't no way you see me turn broke
Cause I been there, I ain't goin' back now
This new life, equal stress, i don't back down
Fightin' thru life, i feel stuck in a dump
I miss Rates, we ain't spoke in a couple of months
And I'm movin' on, I'm watchin' all this time fly
Thinkin' is my mind right, livin' in the lime-light
Remainin' on my feet, thru all the fuckin' hatin
Now them haters, when they see me man they tell me that i made it
I can't help but to make my life all public
The fans seem to get it because they tell me that they love it
They breathe it, they need this
They need another way but I'm feelin' at my wits' man i swear i need a break
We top the charts, have me poppin' pills, whats apart
Where the happiness come cause i got the cash and lost my heart
Realest on the mic here, need me then I'm right here
I'm washin' down prespcriptions but I'm mixin' it with light beer
I gotta find a way cause lately i've been stressful
But through it all, I am still the most successful
How's it work? Shit I'm losing my brain
But I keep getting bigger so the movement remains
I've reached a million to date and tried to move it away
Cause black skies cover me 'til a human is grey
I got a lot up on my plate now, considered as an icon
But then I'm told I'm here and i live my life wrong
This could be the realest shit that i ever wrote
This could be the realest thing that i ever quote
I got a couple enemies, they want me in a cemetery
They can knock me off but they can not stop my legacy
I keep movin' thru the depths of the flames
I put my life on the line so you remember my name
When I leave Aussie rap, thats a day off the map
Thats the way of my rap, no one sprayed it like that
Who's around? Cause I'm feelin' on my own now
You missed my buddy but i guess the phone got thrown out
Years ago you see me on a street with a beer can
Walkin' with the headphones dreamin' to be here man
And now I'm here man, no i don't fear them
Now i got a clear head, thought you're gonna be there
But you not nah, but you not nah
In a hot car, screamin' what? what you got huh?
I'm a live on the charts with the top ah
So sick that they needa call the docta
But you not nah, but you not nah
In a hot car, screamin' what? what you got huh?
I'm a live on the charts with the top ah
So sick that they needa call the docta
