Slip down, don't you fall you a soldier
That's me talking to myself in the cold ah'
Around the time I was going through some rough shit
Seventeen, skinny wreck on some fuck shit
Hated life, felt the upper-class looked down, then I joined the upper-class how I'm meant to look now
Still the same cunt fresh with the foul mouth
Certified been making haters fuckin' bow down
Ask about me I carry this game before I married this game and boy hasn't it changed
I use to rap in the rain, when I was smashed off my face
Pulled back with my mates, were they happier days shit
I don't know, we was only trying to have fun
We was living in the town you had to back up
What you said on these C-town Streets
Inspiration for the real ones when I move to beach, just reach


When we all go out its the same way, heard your man got shot in the lane way
Where you first met, now you thinking' kers next, holdin' on your bottle like there's nothing on this earth left
Get your head up man, they don't know the real you
That's why some hate and some they kinda feel you
I don't care, I'm looking for a quiet one
Wonder why I got a spliff, yeah I light it up


Crusing on the high way, on pills - five mate
Looking for a driveway, I just wanna drive away
I never look back unless it's on the good times
But that shit's hard when you stuck with the crooks mind


It took time, but I rose to the top
I left Obese records and they closed up their shop
But I'm a fuckin' hustle-er, I'm ABK till I go
Don't compare me to a rapper, in a lane of my own
And the scene still hate, well ain't that a shock
I think they mad cuz they flop and can't get their shit in shops
I played the game right, why you gotta hate on that
A real rapper from the bottom that has made some cash
Gotta right to have an ego, you fuckin' right
A couple nights celebrating thinkin' what have I
Overcome as I'm sittin' on the beach front
Damn I came a long way for a street cunt
Why curse that I made it in the rhyme game?
Cause I versed everything that came my way
Now the one you called chat is a made man
Take my boys on tour, best feelings when I pay them man


When we all go out its the same way, heard your man got shot in the lane way

That's why some hate and some they kinda feel you
I don't care, I'm looking for a quiet one
Wonder why I got a spliff, yeah I light it up


This for the fans that demand a knott
I'm the man alright, I use to stand and grind
In the rain with the mixtape, no one want to buy aye?
When on ebay, it went for 3k the other day
Shouts to T, sellin tapes with me, that was back in the day ain't it crazy to see that I'm sitting at the top we were sitting we would plot, and I gave the crew my word that I'm never going soft


I'm blacklisted everywhere, shutting me out
Will they ever change their mind with a gun in their mouth
That's a couple of stacks that I'm likely to drop, lets get back to the rap, it's my life, it's my job
It's my everything man, it can't get out of my head
It's like it's stuck in there forever with whatever I said
Unwritten letter, Can't rest but it's just for now
They will never understand, guess it's just me wow
