[Verse 1]
Pen-pen-pen-pen-pen to paper, instigator, time to get my write on
A sentence later, hit and make the heights to be an icon
An ego on me, yeah, it's true, I'm not here to deny that
You fuckers are not writers 'cause you went and mentioned iMax
So many fakers 'round and they try so hard for acceptance
Depends on who they know, then sometimes, people make exceptions
I fuckin' hate youse all, we live in Sydney southern street, like
No cokeheads for the law, these kids are dackin' stashin' free knives
Kids are gettin' robbed from everything from hats to shoes to jeans
So tell me why the fuck I'd even care about the music scene
These home invasions getting crazy, half the world on separate wheels
And what, I'm meant to sit here, fuckin' worry 'bout a record deal?
Nah, not today, I live it now, I'm livin' for the moment, true
You rot away or sit it down, I'm shittin' right all over you
So pull up, pull back, I ain't wanna hear what you been [?]
Your raps are never servin' purpose other than some scribblin'

[Hook]
Sydney city, yeah, we got that style that you need
Sty-sty-style that you need, style-style that you need
S-S-S-Sydney city, yeah, we got that style that you need
Yeah, they r-r-really need it, nah, they really need it

Yeah, they r-r-really need it, nah, they really need it

[Verse 2]
It isn't what you think it is and, no, I'm just sayin' that
'Cause all these other fuckin' rappers, they just sound the same as
The other and the other man, they all up on that wack shit
One uppercut, backflip, spit on 'em and that's it
You witnessin' perfection, raw and rough around the edges
Never suffered from rejection as I rap to my reflection
Of my bottle 'cause it's empty still be searchin' for the Henny
But I'd rather crack a wine right out the cask than not have any
You can call it what you want to, not like I be really carin' brah
Rather take the winnings of someone I be respectin', nah
Take that back, the feedback I receive, I barely touch on
I listen to my songs and that's enough for me to march on
Well, what you sayin'? What I'm sayin' is I be the shit, kid
Even if the disc skipped, you realise it's the sick shit
Takeover the disc trip, no limit to what this bitch
[?] I don't like your fucking kick shit

[Hook]
Sydney city, yeah, we got that style that you need
