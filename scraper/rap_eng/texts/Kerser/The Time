[Intro:]
It's dedicated to cunts who said I wouldn't make shit
Like this
I'm in another world
Fuck
Yeah
Yo, what up Nebs?
Kerser

[Verse 1:]
What I just take? Yeah my brain gone
I'm in the club, kind of obvious, my shades on
This is how I make reality a fake dream
Nothing can be as bad as it may seem
Lot of mates carry scars, they're the hood's marks
Treat my life like a joke, it's a good laugh
In the city of the state that I don't know
3 A.M. still get stopped for them photos
Adaption is a fraction of my mind and its reaction
Satisfaction come from passion, what is lacking Scott is smashing
The whole fucking scene, piss test unclean
Test twice just means get high trust me
I'm the man to keep it real to the death
That's why the scene hates me, 'cause they feeling the threat
Crush a pill with a card, mix it in with the coke
Snort the line, rock the show, that's the life, what you know

[Hook:]
It's the life, it's the mic, it's the time, this is mine
And I'm gonna rap this out and be the one to shine
It's the lights, it's the night, it's the lines, it's my mind
I'm living life so fast, I don't know if I'm living right
It's the life, it's the mic, it's the time, this is mine
And I'm gonna rap this out and be the one to shine
It's the lights, it's the night, it's the lines, it's my mind
I'm living life so fast, I don't know if I'm living right

[Verse 2:]
I'm in space bitch, I'm in another world
You can get here, you just gotta toke another swirl
The city lights, it's so distant to me
I'm from the streets and I hear it's a district to see
The South West, home of drive byes, shot dead, high five
Come and visit here, you won't find us in our right mind
Got a big dream I'm missing the tunnel
Making sure I don't forget I got it inked in my knuckles
It's the life, stone cold, might go buy myself some gold
Only time I've ever had it when I stole it, and it's sold
Long gone, probably broke in your house once
That's in the past so I'm keeping my mouth shut
Live gutter, fucking oath didn't chose it
Where do you think I'd be now if there wasn't music?
Or better yet if I didn't have a fan base
You're lucky that you noticed 'cause this could have been a damn waste

[Hook:]
It's the life, it's the mic, it's the time, this is mine
And I'm gonna rap this out and be the one to shine
It's the lights, it's the night, it's the lines, it's my mind
I'm living life so fast, I don't know if I'm living right
It's the life, it's the mic, it's the time, this is mine
And I'm gonna rap this out and be the one to shine
It's the lights, it's the night, it's the lines, it's my mind
I'm living life so fast, I don't know if I'm living right

[Verse 3:]
I ain't home much, but when I am though
I lock myself in my room and try and lay low
Throw a beat, rip it up, smoking weed, sipping cups
Everybody saying that I have to go and live it up
Give a fuck, bout a hater I'ma catch you later, mate
I got a plane I gotta board I'm landing and I get the paper
Not fair right, well yeah try it, compare rhymes
Mine rare tight, I swear I'm the man
I won't quit, no not yet, I'm on a roll
Came so far in this game, got them rotten souls
And new kicks I move quick the tune is
Set when I do this, met with producers
Lot of them are clueless, Nebs got to do this
Now we in the studio, killing with round two it's
Definitely a classic when we killing the booth
Xanax, cough medicine, I'm spilling the truth

[Hook:]
It's the life, it's the mic, it's the time, this is mine
And I'm gonna rap this out and be the one to shine
It's the lights, it's the night, it's the lines, it's my mind
I'm living life so fast, I don't know if I'm living right
It's the life, it's the mic, it's the time, this is mine
And I'm gonna rap this out and be the one to shine
It's the lights, it's the night, it's the lines, it's my mind
I'm living life so fast, I don't know if I'm living right

[Outro:]
Yeah, so am I living right?
Feeling like a fucking miracle man
I come from nothing, no food, no money
To having big dinners
Every days like my birthday
Fuck, in another world here
When did this all happen?
Fucking oath I'm loving it though
ABK, I'm never stopping
I'm not stopping now
There's no rest for the sickest
Fuck it, I'm gonna go straight through
Yo keep that rolling
Can you pass my paper bruz?
Nah to the right
Under that, yeah
Alright yo
