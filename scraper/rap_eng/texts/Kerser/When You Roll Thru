They said I went soft, who you fucking kiddin'?
Pump me block to block, they got their wheels spinnin'
Low ride, straight bump when it goes past
So high blaze up in a known club
Invest, I got a big plan
I'll bring the future up, resting on my wing span
Give you details maybe on a later date
In five years i'm signing rappers up to ABK
I know the secret, i'm a cocky prick
Drop my second album fucking oath it got me rich
I'll make you known, I'll make you a star
But in the meantime this is mine watch me aim for the stars
I'll be paid till the day that I die
Quality with quantity, so i'm making it mine
I got so much power, style so sour
Take my jewelry off before a shower, take a hour
Plus i'm kinda paranoid so the boys that I roll with
Will carry on with beef and feed you up the fucking whole dish
I'm only ever hated when its on the internet
I see 'em up in person and they shake my hand and give respect
That's then way of the game
Some would say it was lame, I don't blame them not me
I was created to be the fucking greatest I mean
If they hatin' on me they gonna hate what they see
If they wait for a year but they probably won't do that
Execution in a noose to any hater, true fact
That means you actually dead
Kinda scary knowin' I could put a stack on ya head bitch
And you hate me for that
No matter what mutha fucka gotta rate me for rap
No taking it back, rhyme make me a stack
I'm sayin' you whack, try hate me for that
Still I roll through and I'm so smooth
Watch me get em, thought I told these cunts I don't loose
Slow it down for a dumb fuck simple
Cheeky smile and ya slut loves dimples
You know my name if it hasn't been saved
Its kinda easy mutha fucka read the tatt on my face
I'm so confident, rappin' i'm on top of it
My CD ya coppin' it, you see me you stopin' there
You take a big breath, you're overwhelmed now
Rappin' is a jail and you sittin' in my cell now
Life on the line when i'm writing a rhyme
While i'm shining so bright and my timin' is nice
This is what I do, nah its not for you
I'll leave ya toe tagged if we battle, wanna loose?
Silly question wasn't it? You name ya top five
I'm mad cause i'm not in it
That's a joke think I really fuckin' care brah
I'm at the top now you know its true and you like yeah nah
Yeah hah, I fuckin' know i'm too fresh
I'll stay above ya head like you frozen in a suplex
So take a flick, witness the sickness
I met ya bitch once and she's givin' up her digits
I'll leave it at that
I could hit the fuckin' charts if I breath on a track, cunt

All ya needin' is the Kers when you roll through
I told em all before, they tried so hard ignore who?
Kerser, save that name till I next up
Takin' over didn't think they wanna step up
All you needin' is the Kers when you roll through
I told em all before, they tried so hard ignore who?
Kerser, save the name till I next up
Takin' over didn't think they wanna step up
