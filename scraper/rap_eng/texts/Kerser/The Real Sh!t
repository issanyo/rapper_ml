[Verse 1: Kerser]
Our pay, got it sitting in a satty bag
Me and Nebs spending big, yeah we happy lad
What you know about working on an album?
Watch it sell, pop pills counting thousands?
Put a bit aside for the boys on the inside
Play the music over phones so they hear us spit rhymes
I went from Nautica to Gucci
You rap fake 'cause you saw it in a movie
We rap life straight street when we represent
You ain't seen what we seen you ain't getting it
They used to laugh 'cause the brands was the no names
Now I rock gold and designer got no shame
Toe tag body bag any competition
Say you're rooting bitches, but your fucking cock is missing
ABK that's the crew, that's the lifeline
You hear a click click followed with a bye bye

[Hook: Kerser]
Kers and Nebs taking over the rap biz
You hear our catalogue and you're thinking, "yeah, that's sick"
Yeah, that's sick, that's street, that's the real shit
Yeah, that's speech, that beat, yeah, I feel it
Kers and Nebs taking over the rap biz
You hear our catalogue and you're thinking, "yeah, that's sick"
Yeah, that's sick, that's street, that's the real shit
Yeah, that's speech, that beat, yeah, I feel it

[Verse 2: Nebs]
Kers and Nebs kicking back on the lean
Stacking the green, slanging crack to fiends smashing the scene, uh
No need for me to say who the winner is
We made too much cash from these tracks, it's ridiculous
I'm looking at these other rappers trying not to laugh
Popping Xannies in the studio I'm high as fuck!
Your missus heard my sexy voice on "The Nebulizer"
Now she's begging me and texting me to get inside her
Coked up, I party keen on the party scene
Even fucking Charlie Sheen said he can't compete
When it comes to beats, N-E-B is hard to beat
Slurping on a cup of lean till my face is army green
This is the real shit, I'm ill wit I kill this
You've been doing it for years and you're still shit
I made this beat and I hit the jackpot
Nebs leaving all you rappers looking like wack gronks!

[Verse 3: Kerser]
I gotta fetish, yeah a fetish for the ashcay
I blew up, now a bunch of fucking lads hate
I think they mad 'cause I brag about pay
An they still pissed off on the back of the train
I'm in the club with my crew, yeah we're easy to find
Aussie rap needs balls, yeah leave it to I
Never ever hold a grudge 'cause we handle it quick
I'm on stage, your missus trying to put her hand on my dick
Yeah, this time around, I'll be claiming I'm king
I keep it raw proper Australian, you dig?
Fresh cunt, drip swag on your new rugs
Hypocrite when I tell you not to do drugs
If I'm out then you're likely to see
My fucking eyes out my head and I'm grinding my teeth
Kers and Nebs, KNR call it what you will
And when Nebs mixed this I was popping pills, for real!
