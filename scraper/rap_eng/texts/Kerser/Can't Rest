[Verse 1:]
Me and Rates found a magnum .44
It was my dad's we was asking him what that's for
He said he had some enemies and we were too young
He said mum had left him, he can't tell us too much
We went back home to mums now we broke as
She always crying, she depressed I
Need to go back and work out what the fuck was up
It's been buried, block it out now we fucked on drugs
And mum can't work out why cops cuffing us
Slapped Rates in the face cause he puffed and buzzed
And my dad used to ring when he was drunk as fuck
I hear him fighting with mum, I think he loves her but
I'm only ten years old now I hug my little brother
Love my mother and my father but there's gotta be another
Way for us, I watched it fall apart
I'm eleven years old with a broken heart
It's kinda funny 'cause the shit that teared my family apart
Is the same reason why my girl's leaving, gotta laugh
Life that I know, live in pain, gotta go
Cause my brain doesn't know why I play in the zone
On the streets doing breaks where my fate would lay
Felt so locked in, couldn't break away
Don't feel the same today, 'cause rap saved my life
And when Rates hears this, will he play it twice?
Or are the memories too much? Remember it true bruz
Come along the road, don't forget what I do 'cause
You're doing it too, make moves and march on
Take my life now this could be my last song, I'm gone

[Verse 2:]
Life just ticks, I might just quit
In a life like this, is my life just shit?
I got a feeling that for me it's kinda on its way
I had to tell you why I'm here I'm being honest aye
I picture gun blasts, two cunts, one mask
My thin blood marks walls, fuck I must laugh
That's a dream that I had on my birthday
Just luck that I fit it in with word play
Now if that happens I am right I was a genius
If it doesn't I am paranoid I mean this
There's my life hate I'm used to it
Last ten years mate got me moving quick
And I fight with my girl like a movie flick
'Cause she listening to rumours by a groupie bitch
I can't take this shit, I'ma break to bits
I got my taste of fame and it tastes like shit
Everyone talk shit and they taking shots
They don't know who I am but they breaking Scott
Is there anyone there that could make it stop
I don't need no hoe trying to take it off
I just need my road when I'm taking off
And I hit that stage while I'm blazing pot
This the life of a rock star stuck in the past
That's the 2-2-5 yeah I'm chucking it up
Need space today, I need to take my brain
Reconstruct that shit before it's sprayed away today
Yeah, let it roll, yeah

[Verse 3:]
Tell me do you hear this, write a review
They say I can't rap deep what you like me to do?
You wanna hear about a blade tucked since I hit seventeen
Paranoid, fucked up, like I think they getting me
You wanna hear about smoking till your chest claps
Or sixteen, doing breaks I need to get that
Or bills piling up on top of the fridge
Mum yelling at the paper, how she gonna pay this
How we got a place to live but its slipping quick
She has to split, need my own place I'm spinning out shit
But I moved out young, turned boy to man
I got my dad pride now, come and join the clan
Now I don't give a fuck and I'm ready for war
I'll take your head from your neck leave your head at your door
Fuck everyone dissing, you don't know what I am
I'm a motherfucking soldier and I'm going at them
That's why I'm selling CDs on the verge of greatness
Once this drops I'll be referred to as the greatest
So sit back, there's no reason to hate
And if you still hate me now, best believe that you're fake aye

[Outro:]
No way will I end it now
I gotta take these thoughts and send em out
I am lost so lost but I need a buzz
'Cause it helps me knowing fans need me cuz
No way will I end it now
I gotta take these thoughts and send em out
I am lost so lost but I need a buzz
'Cause it helps me knowing fans need me cuz
