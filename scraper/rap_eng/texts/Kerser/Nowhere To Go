[Intro: Sample]
Are you alone?
No one's out here
Are you alone?
No one's out here

[Verse 1]
Same day, started as the last one
Nothin' changed, kind of hoping it's a fast one
Now my mates man, I hardly ever see 'em
I know they feel I changed but I'm feelin' like I'm dreamin'
Now when we drink up, we reminisce and laugh
I'm feelin' bad, I'm out it but they still stuck in the raw
Weighin' drugs on a scale just to pay bills
Plus the boys doing time, how do they feel
No matter what, I am stuck in the gutter
Money can't change shit, it's my brain motherfucker
If I had enough bills, I'd get all the crew fed
But I gotta feed the fam and remember you said
You had my back, well I'm needing the support
Try and move but I crash, plus I'm fiendin' just to talk
Nobody want to listen so I'm walking these dead streets
Feeling like the only thing that knows is a Nebs beat
What the fuck you thinking, 'cause I got fans now
That I don't need your help? Fuck, I'm putting the pen down
Wait I can't do that, 'cause that's the shit right
This the medicine that's going to save a kid's life
But I talk about drugs, so now I'm no good
Show your parents what the fuck around your own hood
Then maybe just maybe you'll fucking understand why
And hate me but rate me and the exact same time, 'cause I

[Hook]
Feel alone like there's nowhere to go
I try to find a home but I'm back on the road
Another mate rang but I missed the call
So you can use your fuckin' brain but you ain't thinkin' at all
And yeah, I feel alone like there's nowhere to go
I try to find a home but I'm back on the road
Another mate rang but I missed the call
So you can use your fuckin' brain but you ain't thinkin' at all

[Verse 2]
I could be drug fucked, that would make sense
You try to hold the weight I'm holding, it would break legs
Cones that I've packed, every tab that I've popped
On the phone to my dad, but he don't know that I'm lost
'Cause I play it all good, no one needs to know shit
Don't know if I should, don't know why I wrote this
Feeling so confused, why the fans showin' love?
Why I'm writing shit like this, does it mean I'm growing up?
If that's the fucking case, I'd rather feelin' like a kid again
When we was running mucks I probably had them people listenin'
Nowadays, it's not the same, or tell me is this what the fame
Is doing to my brain? I've gone insane, I need a doctor mate
I got a lot at stake, I gotta stop it ayy
They tell me drop the pills, I end up fuckin' popping eight
I got my girl and thank fuck for that
I love her, need her 'cause I'm losin' all my trust in rap
Plus she found my fucking stash and she flushed it down the toilet
Next day, I went and scored, don't talk about it, I avoid it
Where to go? What to do? 'Cause I'm lost, what?
Now these haters gonna use it as a soft spot
But what's not to say that you is not the same
Somehow I'm in my right mind but I lost my brain
That's my heart, sittin' served up on the paper
I fucked up and saved nothin' for later

[Hook]
Feel alone like there's nowhere to go

Another mate rang but I missed the call
So you can use your fuckin' brain but you ain't thinkin' at all
And yeah, I feel alone like there's nowhere to go
