[Intro: Kerser]
Yeah
Kerser
The sickest
[?]
Fuck
Hide your girlfriend
Charlie Sheen and this shit
Champion, the best and the great
The greatest, the god, the machine, the king, the murderer
The bomb smoker, the prince, the purse snatcher
The master, royalty too
You can’t fuck with me now

[Verse 1: Kerser]
Understand what I’m doin’ right now
Got it down in your town with a sound that is ground
Breakin’, takin’ any situation
Make men hate and then drown anticipation
I’ve arrived; what, you didn’t know so?
Here, take a photo, use it as a logo
Don’t go runnin’ ‘round actin’ homo
Diss me in a track then you must need the promo
I’m the cocaine, market me
In Oz hip-hop, I’m the fuckin’ Charlie Sheen
Got these heads pissed off ‘cause I’m passin’ by
Dot on the top ‘cause the half of I
Think about it, use your brain
If I’m one of a kind, then who’s the same
I know who you know, they like me better
Get me fucked up yeah, write whatever
You never met a motherfucker right like me
I’ll pay fifty grand for a signed ID
Might be the fact that I’m so sick
Might leave you smacked chaps and [?]

[Hook: Anthony “Rats” McCarthy]
There’s no fuckin’ with me now
There’s no fuckin’ with me now
There’s no fuckin’ with me now
There’s no fuckin’ with me now

[Verse 2: Kerser]
You wouldn’t have a clue what I do in the booth
What I do is the truth, what I do, bulletproof
Can’t be touched, I won’t laugh at cunts
Tryin’ to do what I do but they half of us
Nah, wait, not even, I hate your team
And I’m a major prophet, you break it even
Rackin’ up a line in a penthouse bitch
In a spa with a wine then I get found sick
I’m the sickest [?] vicious
Rolled into one, yeah, this what the shit is
Rip this every time that I bust
When I’m rhymin’, I must [?] cunt
Snap you in the face with the back of my hair
Then I slap you in the front then the back again
I used to have it clean now there’s drugs in the way
And I’m fucked in the brain but I bust it insane
Every time I write, yep, fuckin’ heaps more
Kill it on the beat, Nebs on the keyboard
Saddy packed and the Xannies stashed
With a rack of gas and my hatchet dacked

[Hook: Anthony “Rats” McCarthy]
There’s no fuckin’ with me now
There’s no fuckin’ with me now
There’s no fuckin’ with me now
There’s no fuckin’ with me now

[Verse 3: Kerser]
Heard they done it, yeah, they done it and they did wrong
Tried to fuck around, I’m sittin’ with a lit bong
Seen a lot of other rappers try to fuck with
What I do, what I do and it’s done, sick
I love myself and let the haters hate
‘Cause today, the haters hate and they fade away
ABK, that’s the team that I play for
Scribble down the rhymes that I write on the A4
Piece of paper, here’s the hater
Jealous motherfucker, yeah, see you later
Grabbed the kid by the neck and said “Listen”
Then he started pissin’ before I could spit man
Heard it lad and it’s probably true
What I got to do just to pop a few
[?] tablets, never really had shit
Now I want it all, stuck your face on your backflip
That’s it, yeah, I’m the man, mate
Don’t believe me, pay a visit to my fan base
Damn straight, we can leave it at that
In the limousine lad, with me in the back

[Hook: Anthony “Rats” McCarthy]
There’s no fuckin’ with me now
There’s no fuckin’ with me now
There’s no fuckin’ with me now
There’s no fuckin’ with me now
