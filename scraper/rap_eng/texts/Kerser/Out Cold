Out cold they found me dribbling asleep
And I don't mean no talking I don't dribble when I speak
Prescription med's, alcohol, saddies sitting next to the bowl
Sweating even though I'm cold the stress don't let it take its toll
When did this happen when I let myself turn into shit
When I was younger man I swear I didn't wish for this
My dream was raping god if you make this happen god I will get off everything and you won't ever see me slacking nah
Then it happened now I can't live up to my own word
I feel like I betrayed you cause you went and made this work
And I ain't crazy I know you just went to set my road
I pray that happened if I didn't pray I'd be unknown
Fucking nutter fucking drugs are gone and tripped me out
You thinking that will I be thinking you should sit on down
My life's a task and its got me thinking fuck it
A Pipe is passed then im probably gunna puff it
Honesty ain't that what they all be begging for
Then your honest half them ain't be your fan no more
But fuck it let em know people doubt me anyway
Wonder why to get to sleep i gotta pop a any-zay
That's pig latin I ain't here to hide no shit
I meant xanax if you didn't catch me slightly flip
I march on though head be doing mad twirls
The spinning cycle got me feeling like I had 12
More then I did already tripped
Empty bottles fucking oaf' I already sipped
No matter what I do you sitting there to judge my shit
That's why every song I'm telling them to suck my dick
It's 2am and I'm sitting here the light is off
Tell myself to clean the act
But knowing that i might not stop
I'll be fine im the kers I gotta be strong
Coz nothin ever happened if im gonna be Scott

[Hook Repeat 2x]

It's all good but I
Can't talk now
Move forward but I
Fall back down
My maze wavy
I try to make it through
Like what's it gunna' do im only gunna' take a few

I can't stop yeah we gon' ride this out
And they gonna find me with these pages writing with me lying down
But don't wake me up I'm living life inside a dream
Well is this is better I don't know I guess its time to see
You couldn't in-lighten me but now im gettin' high for free
So quitin looking shitty like I gotta live my life and breathe
Be a better man try and make a better plan
Feeling like a kid but im reaching my mid 20's damn
If you could understand maybe you would feel the same
And being truthful fuck I just went and destroyed my name
You love it real though broke it down real slow
Really real and I just feel only the real would know
I feel like going you are welcome to come join me
Chose to rap on stage because no-one was gonna employ me
Just a big winge' nah its from the heart cuz'
Proud of my shit till the day comes that my heart jumps
I missed a beat I ain't talking instrumental
Worst part about it is its totally preventable
Only gotta get a few only god has ever knew
I wright my life and there is not one thing pretend its true
