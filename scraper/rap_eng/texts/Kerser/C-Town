[Intro]
You tired again cunt?
*Kerser and Nebs muttering*
Ayo look, I'm gonna say some shit yeah?

[Verse 1]
A bad bitch tryna catch me with an eye wink
I tell her "Fuck off, go and pour my drink"
King Kers, Nebs One at the fresh shit
Your dream girl treating us like she desperate
And she ain't even wanna speak to you
So we throw her to the crew like sweet [?]
She away, eshay
Everything is esh-fray
My mission is to get paid
Blew a stack at the mall for the fuck of it
Out of everything I brought I only wore half of it
Got 'em jealous, Aussie Hip-Hop has a new face
That's why my posters hanging in your girlies room mate
What's a pawn to a king?
Bitches use my film clips for a porno, it's sick
I'm still flipping cash, Nebs still on the payroll
He gets his cash then he looks at me like 'HEY YO!"

[Chorus]
Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town
I come through with a pound in the C-Town
Sipping lean at the spot is where I be found
Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town
I come through with a pound in the C-Town
I got my weed with a bottle look at me now

[Verse 2]
In the studio with Nebs and we sipping on some rich shit
Bitches screaming at the door for some real dick
Money on our mind, Gucci on the shirt
Do the Kers bitch, do it, do it 'til it hurts
Why you angry at your sales, you can't move nah?
My whole crew move units, that's the truth brah
Took my missus to the snow for a month
Came back, new pay fans are loading me up
It's all the same, I'm a hustler I came from the streets
The same ones that play this saying "Fuck the police"
In the hood, drive through in my new car
See the boys, call the shots, then I cruise brah
I'm a Rap God, no Shady tho
More drugs, more liquor, more crazy bro
Next promoter that is shifty with the bread swap
I'm leave it at this *click* headshot

[Chorus]
Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town
I come through with a pound in the C-Town
Sipping lean at the spot is where I be found
Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town
I come through with a pound in the C-Town
I got my weed with a bottle with a mean sound

[Bridge]
*Kers and Nebs muttering*

[Chorus]
Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town
I come through with a pound in the C-Town
Sipping lean at the spot is where I be found
Bitches wanna get down in the C-Town
They know we don't fuck around in the C-Town
I come through with a pound in the C-Town
I got my weed with a bottle with a mean sound
