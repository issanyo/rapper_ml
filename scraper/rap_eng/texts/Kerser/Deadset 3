Don't compare me to another fucking pop star
Come party with the king of the rap
Drunk cunt hit stage as I'm swinging an axe yeah

A bunch of bad bitches trying to get up with me
This is my city repping it hard
Everyone look shocked when I step in the club
But its
Sydney and these cunts are nuts, hit stage with j and we puffing blunts
You know I'll be back at a later date
In a helicopter yelling ABK
You think I'm joking motherfucker ill be violent throwing up pills as I'm yelling at the pilot
Take me to Melbourne i'ma hit the stage fresh
Bass bang probably gonna fucking break necks
Jump on stage hit it raw no safe sex
They go crazy when they see my fucking face yes
Catch me at the hifi probably gonna sky dive
Hope they don't write another page about drive-by
Next bruz Brisbane is up ask them I'm known as the sickest cunt
And the thing about briz is that they love this kid
By the looks of the crowd the drugs are sick
Last track I reversed it yes, but after Briz' this time fucking Perth is next
As soon as I touched down, weed lit puffed clouds
Five star balcony thinking fuck how
Did I get here Perth goes so hard
Kers one king swagged an you know brahh'

Ima hit the stage with flowers wait a couple of hours, back stage looking at the mirror through the powder
