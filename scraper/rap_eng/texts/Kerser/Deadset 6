[Intro: Gavin Rossdale]
It must be your skin I'm sinking in
It must be for real 'cause now I can feel
And I didn't mind
It's not my kind
It's not my time to wonder why
Everything's gone white
And everything's grey
Now you're here now you're away
I don't want this
Remember that
I'll never forget where you're at
(Oh fuck, you got a camera again?)

[Verse]
Fuck's happening? Yeah it's been a minute
Topping ARIA charts, I don't need to win it
Jump up fresh cunt you be missing me
Kers one still saying fuck the industry
Rocking up to my gigs with a pitch-fork
On the stage yelling "Where's Tracy Grimshaw?"
Same Kers who had the youth in a frenzy
And send every cunt crazy in their twenties
Once again cunt, I'm hitting the road
Get your missus on stage and put my dick in her throat
There's the lines that they rip and shred up
It's deadset six can you picture seven?
Here we go kick it off in Melbourne
They love me there, I'm the kid they yelling
From the crowd and their eyes are wide
Then their looking at mine, mine are twice the size (shit)
V.I.C I love the cunts
First week of March got a bunch of buds
Drop to the airport and I'm rollin' spliffs
Cunts see me, they're like holy shit
Then I'm up to the Q.L.D
I'm a sick cunt true, well you tell me
Bris they are hoping for me
They want a feature like their something on a pokie machine
Another year with the Brissy vibe
Throwing eccys to the crowd to get ya missus high
That's right girls, you're getting frisky right
And don't blame me if the bitches die (shit)
March seventeenth and I'm back to home
Talkin' in code 'cause they tapped my phone
Sydney city I'm a fucking king
It's ABK still, the cunts to win
Next day, gotta head down to Tas too
In a boat on the wharf 'cause the rack's too
Sensitive for the sniffer dogs
So we going over waves and we sniff the lot (shit)
Rockin' up to the shows in a mac truck
Titties [?] from the skinnies to the fat sluts
And we back to Fowlers man
Crash a plane into the place like their towers damn
Hopped out, not a scratch, I'm okay dude
If you're givin' me spliff, better make two
Adelaide, yeah, you know what's next
I'm gonna talk about your drugs, buds, weed and sesh yes
That's right, from the east to west
And I ain't gonna lie, your weed's still the best, yes
I walk around like I'm in a maze
With my chainsaw on so they clear the way, ayy
Chop the arm of a cunt in a front row
Hangin' off the other arm of a dumb ho
Now they try to cut my tour down to one show
Never mind, off to Perth, last time bro
Step on stage and I'm drunk with my shades on
No triple J 'cause I never play a gay song
Jump out to the crowd, they won't let go
Can you blame them? It's the Kers, I'm the best bro
Perth city always show me love
Search Perth titties with my boner tucked
Security scared 'cause I own the club
Then I'm yellin' to the crowd, fuckin' show me drugs
Never ever change, always stay the same
Came a long way, never changed from fame
Ten years ago, on a train with Rates
Now, I'm rack fucked up, on a stage with Jay
Fuck backstage, playing the harmonica
I'm a fat cunt next to The Veronicas
Throw a bitch by the head to the moshpit
Wait, once again, go get ya tickets now from Oztix
We're ahead now let me get back on the right track
I'm so fresh, the word fresh won't deny that
I'm the man and this is where your prize at
Diss myself, I'm the only one that fights back
Still the king, still cruising bro
Till I bruise a nose and fuckin' Ruby Rose
Probably get sued when I drop this shit
And tell the judge "Fuck you, you can suck my dick"
Gotta be my best bet, leaving you on death rest
Turn you to a red head, wait, another death threat?
Can't be 'cause I'm headin' to the next set
I'ma see you at the gigs, deadset

[Outro]
Ch-yeah  (Get ya tickets now from Oztix)
I guess I'll see ya there (Get ya tickets now from Oztix)
We gon' party (Get ya tickets now from Oztix)
Life's good
Yeah (Get ya tickets now from Oztix)
