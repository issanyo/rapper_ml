[Verse]
I’m the man look they calling me a vet, wow
Time flew shit the scene is a mess now
I remember they were hating when I made it big
Now they all begging me to come and save the shit
Funny how time almost change everything
Mini Kers clones everywhere, who let 'em in?
Wasn’t me, ask anyone that knows Kers
Who the man you call when you need a dope verse?
Gonna be a sad day when I leave the scene
I ticked all my goals off, I don’t need to dream
I’m getting over rap, I’m just being honest now
I’ve done enough to call it quits, I'ma stop it now
Wait a minute, gotta tour that I gotta do
Sold out Kers shows, this is nothing new
Who the fuck are you? I don’t know your raps bro
But I can tell you where you picked up that flow
And I can tell you where you got the whole swag from
I’m riding down the highway got a bag of
Fat buds, yeah I’m lighting up the good smoke
I don’t share, you hit this and you would choke
Where we end up, man I came a long way
Never weak 'cause we did this shit the strong way
Just triggered off a memory, I’m clogged up
I miss my mates, they miss life but they locked up
Sounds common these days till you lose count
I’m sick of people saying, “god, look at you now”
I had this dream forever and you never showed an interest
Maybe back then you should’ve asked me to invest
That’s why I’m arrogant, plus I’m mad cocky too
Everything I said I’d do, I go and fuckin' do
We the clique, I’m the king with the two fives
Other two in front of that you the new guys
Listen up I write beats, my flows too nice
Who writes lyrics like I do?
I’m way ahead of you like you never pay your dues
I went and made my moves right, that’s why I am too high
Always let my crew shine, I’m lappin’ rappers two times
They braggin’ ‘bout all the shit that I’d done before
Put the stacks next to Kers, they ain’t done it all
My swag brang money and my money brang swag
That’s the kinda shit that made the whole scene mad
The Kers Oner, sitting on your nerves fucker
Play this in the winter, so hot probably turn summer
Earn butter, I just spread it on my bread now
King Kers, I ain’t never been a let down
I could drip swag, right into a zip bag
Make it airtight then sniff that for impact
A kid back with a style that they duplicate
Ever say I’m falling from the top? You must be stupid mate
It’s all the same in the game so I switch lanes
I’ve been droppin’ hot shit since my mixtapes
I’ve been holding shit down, can’t deny that
You’d kill yourself if you try to be this fly lad
They put my tracks on the pedestal to pick at it
Yet they wonder why my hunger's gone, I’m sick of it
Told the crew at the start, I'ma run this
Now they like, “shit, look at what the cunt did”
Always had my back there so I appreciate
The headline so I’ll always leave the venue late
‘Member Gunsta came to mine for the film clip
Wish I listened to him then and that’s real shit
But it’s all good, I turned into a superstar
This rap game strange, watch how you moving brah
My heart's cold, I find it hard to trust cunts
I learned my lesson in the end we all fuck up
Fuck the scene bitch, I ain’t do a rapper tag
I’m so dope, they should put me in a satty bag
Light it up I set trends they can copy that
But they see it here first, yeah they're watchin’ that
Queue that came up, grew in front on cameras
Spending nights in studios, man they gon’ remember us
First up that was me, man I hustle hard
Who else could get rich off their fuckin' bars?
It’s the Kers man, I’m only known to kid fact
I ain’t here to compete, that’s a mismatch
Check the work rate, I ain’t had a break yet
Non stop work, probably why I made it
We gone ride this one till the wave break
I never took a loss, never need to safe face
Same lane, you ain’t even in the same race
Their rapping ‘bout shit that ain’t ever even take place
The K-E-R-S man I’m too sick, true shit
They watching how I do this
Watching all the movements, I’m making it look too cinch'
Swag floating in the air as I walk past
She got a wet puss, I’m giving you the forecast
Woke up, hit a joint then lay back down
'Cause my buds are the size of a hash brown
Oh yeah, too smooth, bring the Kers back
Squash the world in my hand, now the Earth flat
Hooked up worldwide, I might travel soon
Check me out this is how a real rapper do
So fresh but we’ll never be on So Fresh
Engraved In The Game, that is something you should go get
Don’t stress, you can catch me on the rebound
From the start bitch I been yelling "C-Town"
I'ma cut it here, shit, turn the mic off
Smashed the beat hard, man they calling this a write off, Kers
