Verse 1:
Picken up my pen then I’m putten it down
Gotta thousand kids tryna copy my sound
They can’t do what I do, I’m one of a kind
Wiv a middle finger up coz im fucken ya mind
Back to the board coz I'm rappen it raw
And I happen to saw what they acten no more
Ima separate me and you, a level above
From where you at now I'm like a devil on drugs
Peddalin drugs in a kettle and jug
My music be a drug that’ll get you buzzed
Sunglass cover eye coz im fucken high
Never seen skill I reveal coz im jumpen I
Will never stop to the day that I die
I’m given you the shit to maintain and survive
Blame me im high like day to day
Now the coppers tryna lock down ABK
I fade away to a distant day and pray for change I can’t live this way
On the edge now I think need codeine
Wiv a flow so mean make ya bro OD
Oh please gotta stop what I do
Now I’m poppin a few, need an option or two
To open up quick coz it tock tock tick
And it tick tick tock now I twist this top
Then I’m getting high and drunk again
Wiv a buncha friends till it fucken ends
My mind crazy write rhymes daily
Rack me up I need 9 lines baby
I’ma do what I do Im in love with this
I need a hunger fix I gotta hundred tricks
You comin or not on my way to the top
No waitin to stop, so blatantly hot

Hook:
Out my way, I’m on my way are you not gonna ride?
I told em Weeo we can do this and I promise I
Will never leave you, if you down for me I’m down for you
You give me time and Imma tell you what I’m out to do
Out my way, I’m on my way are you not gonna ride?
I told em Weeo we can do this and I promise I
Will never leave you, if you down for me I’m down for you
You give me time and Imma tell you what I’m out to do

Verse 2:
Never be the same once they know I came
One foot in the door here we go again
Flow insane wiv a growing pain
I know I say what I know is great
Raw style what to say I’m a sick cunt
They ain't gonna sign me man I gotta switch up
This sucks never turn on a fan
I’ll make what I make till its burnin ya hand
At a single touch I bring the muck
We can meet anytime man I’m quick to punch
A muthafucka haten out on what I do
Don’t hate just admit that it’s not for you
Popped a few got me trippen out bad
With the scene in a bag drown, drown its sad
Think I give a fuck? No way ok
What I do is a move that’ll never go away
I slow it down cause efforts something that I’m lackin in
Hope you didn’t take that serious – I’m back again
Back with a pact and a guarantee
That if ya hang around now you’ll have to see
What I do to a beat and I do it with ease
Since 16 been on the move in the street
Movin to eat mo-move when I speak
Ya never seen what I seen so I’m doomed when I peak
And the fact is I ain’t even at my peak
A young cunt that’ll come and attack a beat
So ya have to see I am actually
Formin into greatness gradually
Ya comin with me are you here to stay
If not leave now I’ll reach my fate

Hook:
Out my way, I’m on my way are you not gonna ride?
I told em Weeo we can do this and I promise I
Will never leave you, if you down for me I’m down for you
You give me time and Imma tell you what I’m out to do
Out my way, I’m on my way are you not gonna ride?
I told em Weeo we can do this and I promise I
Will never leave you, if you down for me I’m down for you
You give me time and Imma tell you what I’m out to do
