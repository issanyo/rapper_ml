I see these bright lights
These people hunt for cash
I can’t adapt, how you sell your soul for hundred stacks?
My life is worth more, my pride is Kers raw
I’m in the city bout to start a fucking turf war
Cos I’m so proud, my bottle watch it go down
I ain't seen no King, so I'm gonna make my own crown
I coped a call, Stracy's sitting in a prison cell
I'm spinning out, like where's my boys, cos Shoei's in as well
Is this the life we chose? Something for the nicest clothes
Sit back with the ice and doe, watch my brothers fight for hope
Fuck rhyming, if it does than it's a bonus
I say what's on my mind, and if it rhymes I didn't notice!
Hairs up on your arms stand, realness in my palm man
I hold the Earth then curl it round, no wonder people can't stand!
Safe promises, I made the snakes obvious
Sometimes I don't know who to trust, even my mates I gotta to give
Up on paranoia, burnt too many bridges
Just realised it rhymes - Kerser is the sickest!
Fuck rhyming, if it does than it's a bonus
What happened to that line man, my brain is gone it's hopeless
But I still be the realised
That's why they feel this, from the deals that the real missed
That's the bad thing bout grabbing the mic
The best rapper that you find probably hasn't been signed
And it'll stay that way, but me I'm gonna make that change
You weighing up those [?] you be getting fed, I'm gonna take your plate
Yeah you lads cry, strong - I've got my Dads pride
Never giving up. You holding beef it turns to mash pie
I think I'm built different, you can see the skill in it
I did this shit myself, I never ever got a mill ticket
Since the 'Highest Man', shit I've been the highest man
Promoters call my manager, you best to be supplying grams
Where I go from here? Confused, not knowing what to do
Got no other option to, make a change - I'm opted to
You can dislike, shit ice, spit fire
Imagine what I'd be, if kid never hit pipes
I sware on something you won't witness again
You won't experience I vibe like what I've writ with my pen
Because I'm sicker than them - this is the finishing slam
Fucking ill, you know the deal because I did it again - UH!
