[Hook: John Andrew]
I'm feeling the pressure, there's nowhere to go
Nobody knows that I'm 'bout to explode
And it's all in my head
Somebody help me, I feel all alone
Nobody knows that I'm losing control
And it's all in my head, in my head

[Verse 1: Kerser]
All in my head, paranoid
Drop a couple pills and I'm mad annoyed
Can't believe I got myself bad destroyed
Trying to beat life, I don't have a choice
Sitting up late every night I try fly by
Wonder why but I can't deny
I'm kinda lost and it's fucked, I'm famous
But it's what I wanted and I'm not just saying it
Go back and take a listen when I started this
All I ever wanted was a part in this
Then I went past every other artist
Then I got a habit and it's fucked 'cause now I feel like a target
Everyday I wake up I feel like my heart ache
Dunno what to do I just wanna restart it
Never would of rapped if I knew this was the outcome
Goin' in public feels like I'm having anxiety attacks
And I try to relax nut, I'm hiding the facts
That there's a knife in my dacks
Paranoid yeah, at the worst of times
I spill my whole life when Kerser rhymes
And when Scott raps he falls apart
I make real rap, don't call it art
They may feel that I'm torn apart
If it's all in my head then I'ma follow my heart

[Hook: John Andrew]
I'm feeling the pressure, there's nowhere to go
Nobody knows that I'm 'bout to explode
And it's all in my head
Somebody help me, I feel all alone
Nobody knows that I'm losing control
And it's all in my head, in my head

[Verse 2: Kerser]
All in my head and I need to escape
Feeling locked in, need keys to the gate
I don't ever wanna go back to the old me
Think before you say it what a smart man told me
I never did though always on my shit bro
Dropping hot rhymes and my mind is Skitzo
Shit no, am I losing track?
When I used to roam the street, I got used to that
Not used to fame, it fucked my head
I blame the fame when I'm dumping meds
'Cause it's fucked me up and I know the facts
You can write that down and you can quote me lad
Somebody help 'cause I feel alone
Even at home don't feel at home
Bout to explode on the verge of this
Music weighing up all the perks of this
Is it worth the shit? Well, the cash is nice
But I work so hard for the lavish life
Everyone got to say at the end of the day
That you breaking my trust is the end of the day
Don't mention my name in a negative tone
'Cause I'm paranoid probably get ya dead from my phone
On the way home and the pressure hits
Pop another pill now I'm swept to bits

[Hook: John Andrew]
I'm feeling the pressure, there's nowhere to go
Nobody knows that I'm 'bout to explode
And it's all in my head
Somebody help me, I feel all alone
Nobody knows that I'm losing control
And it's all in my head, in my head

[Bridge: Kerser]
I cannot move no more
I cannot move no more
Why am I on the floor?
Why am I on the floor?
I cannot move no more
I cannot move no more
Why am I on the floor?
Why am I on the floor?

[Hook: John Andrew]
I'm feeling the pressure, there's nowhere to go
Nobody knows that I'm 'bout to explode
And it's all in my head
Somebody help me, I feel all alone
Nobody knows that I'm losing control
And it's all in my head, in my head
