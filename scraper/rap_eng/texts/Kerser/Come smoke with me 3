[Verse 1: Fortay]
12 years old with $20 bucks
Hit the weed spot
Like i'm tryna get me some
By 13 been burning green
Got done cops
When they found an ounce in my lunch box
In high school
I was high as school
Just a little young cunt
Acting like it's cool
Soon as i figured a stick could sell
Knew I'd never work a day
Or be in a cell
How many cunt you know
Sold weed with Snoop?
Rolled blunts with the best
Since I've been in the youth
Cut more hoes than an angry pimp
Punching cones, taking more hits
Then a heavy weight champ
Get the hang man
Fucking with Fort
It's a blaze there
Got more hairs than a monkey's nuts
That one puff stuff that'll fuck you up
Once i lit the esh
I'll be clowning hoes
No interenet
But you can down my load
Light a spliff get high as shit
Its 420 no matter what time it is
Blazing once
It's fucking pointless
Holding 2
Call me double jointed
Loving theses drinks
Without buying me CD's
Feel like sense
Yet i'm driving a green pea

[Verse 2: Kerser]
Come smoke with me
Number 3
Just in time
Got 100 trees
Touch, rewind when it comes to me
Reply every line
While you're puffin' Weed
Since number 1
Not a lot has changed
More pay, more tax
But the chronic stayed
Can't be defeated
Hard to agree with
Walking into clubs
No one asking who he is
They already know
Kers got the flow done
Cutting more grass
Than if i had the mower out
Said i quit yeah fuck i tried
Still clean Ah fuck i lied
Who the fuck cares
Me and Rates
Choppin' weed in a blender
By year 8
Forget to wash it out
Smash on a milk crate
Wonder why mum got high of her milkshake
Sorry mum
That was Me and Abs
Wish you didn't flush
All the Weed you grabbed
I'm an adult now
And i'm earning big
And i know that fact be burning pigs
So i'm smoking Weed
Everywhere i go
Hydro in the air of the studio
Only one rule if you smoke with me
I'm Kers motherfucker
I smoke for free!

[Hook: Fortay & Kerser x2]

(Fortay) Def and Fort
(Kerser) Rates and Kers
(Fortay) We're Sydney's Finest
(Kerser) When we lay a verse
(Fortay) Love blowing Weed
(Kerser) Cunts know the steed
(Fortay) It's the anthem now
(Kerser) Come smoke with me

[Verser 3: Rates]
Have a little blaze
Wait pennin' the page
Creative when I write
You can't better then strain
Is it messing my brain?
I say no way
Looking out at both ways
Thinking i'll be better for change
I blaze up with a spliff
And my morning starts
Getting the vibe
As I'm walking past
The same place
Where i first got stoned in class
We'd go down in the tunnels
And we'd smoke it up
The local bud in my lungs
When it comes to the crunch punch
Cones with a little bit of spinnin'
Just a bit
Thinking I could quit
But I'm spinnin' up a little bit
Smashed off my head
Just to listen to the mix
I'm in love now
With this strength
Increasing my blood up to my brain
Deep in my lungs
Puffin' away
Sit here so stoned
To watch the time
Fade Aye
Rates One got a flow
And i know this
Smokin' odd strains
That are making me choke
Blazed up
When I'm sitting in the zone
And they ringing my phone
Nah I'm gonna let it go
Let a bruz chill
Cause I'm living in my head
This world is my own
So you're living in my text
When I'm in the zone
And i'm feeling the effect
Started when a kid
Probably hit it till I'm dead yeah

[Verse 4: Defiant]
I wanna get high right now
Lookin' in my stash
Seems I've run out
Anxiety be on the climb right now
And i don't wanna chase nobody
With a knife right now
Swear to God I don't wanna go crazy
Heard the streets kinda dry right now
All these cunts selling nothing but the Asian
And my tolerance is pretty high right now
20 past 4 bouncing off the walls
While you're filled
Probably smoke up and ounce or more
But I only can afford
About a Qaurt
Call up my dealer
Like we have to talk
Meet you at the spot
Grab the cash I'm off
Better watch them Drug vans
Setting up shop
If i'm tested
Then fuck that
Don't reckon i'll pass
See my dealer can't deliver
So I gotta drive past
I walk into the place and It's crazy
About to lose my fucking mind right now (Yeah)
Take a puff
From the joint that we blazing
So much weed
Think I'm 'bout cry right now
I know you're chopping up plants
Like Red when you play this
I hope you're getting real high right now
Yeah come smoke part 3
I know you glad that we made this
Got Mary Jane on my mind right now
