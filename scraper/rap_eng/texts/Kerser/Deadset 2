[Intro]

Fucks happening?
Yeah it's been a minute
What a year I ain’t even fucking near the finish
Work hard I took over the rap scene
I told them suck me off now they're crying with bad knees
You know the name I’m the topic of discussion
Cause they talk about me daily maybe diss me man it's nothing
I got the buzz and they bouncing back
I hit stage so high like an ounce of rack
Went up my nose stream oh he blazed and it's so green
Won't see me OD cause I don’t breathe
The home team so I got the support
I'ma plug my shit, I swear I've said that before, ha
This time it's reverse for Kerser
Let's spin that shit around yeah Perth is first ah
West Aus with the fresh cop red hot
Yes Scott have a blaze of the esh what
Them cunts trust party hard
Probably see me in your suburb going bar to bar
Then aye he fell raising hell
The next week motherfucker I’m in A.D.L
The home of the best bud yes I confess bruz
No one got the sticky like the Adelaide fresh bruz
So get the mic let me rip tonight
To a lesbian's, pussy I’m the kryptonite
Work it out turn it down you is dumb 'cause I won't quit
Heading back to Sydney cause they got me feeling homesick
Sydney, the sickest is back
They say I’m stuck up cunt like a dick in flaps lads
Bullshit I’m down to earth
I got love for my fans and they down with Kers
So what the fuck they gonna do the day come and the hell turns
Seven days later Kerser baby down in Melbourne
This place is my home from home
Swear the fans down here go cone for cone
So hold up I'm not too far away
I’m the daddy of this shit, and this is father's day, aye
Brisbane, don’t think I've forgotten
I’m hanging to come see you wait until the dates locked in
Will be soon make some room for the Bris lads
They look at you and laugh if you sipping on a six pack
Need a case, need a keg and a straw to
Why you need a straw?
I can't tell you what that’s for dude
Newcastle they hanging for me
But I'm hanging just as much man I’m anxious to see
If you still love me like you used to do
It's Kerser, of course you do lad it's true
And I can't wait to come back can’t stop to run lad
Guarantee you see me with a trophy like I won that
Tas too got 'em fiending it hurts ya
Facebook.com slash the Kerser
Kers one yeah I'm back on my hot shit
Thought I better add get your tickets now from Moshtix
I’m in paradise, via satellite
Set the satellite on fire they can't see me having lines
I was told tone it down for the radio
No, fuck you I don’t care if you play me bro
I'ma be me and you can be you
Ay, Kerser fans fuck yes I'll see ya soon
No Rest For The Sickest, guaranteed best yet
Cop that shit when it drops Deadset
