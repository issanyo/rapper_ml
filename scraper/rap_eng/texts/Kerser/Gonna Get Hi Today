[Intro: Anthony "Rats" McCarthy]
I get that feeling, like every day
I'm just trying to escape but it ain't easy, it ain't easy, yeah
So I'm gonna get higher and I'm gonna get higher
'Cause it ain't easy, it ain't easy, yeah
Baby, baby, I know (baby, I know)
Baby I gotta go (I gotta go)
'Cause you don't fiend like I do (you don't fiend like I do)
Tell me what can I do?
(Gotta get my drink on) Gotta get my drink on
(But I don't wanna bring you down) Don't wanna bring you down
I really gotta have it girl to ease my mind
('Cause I'm not gonna be here for long) I'm not gonna be here for long
I get that feeling, like every day
I'm just trying to escape but it ain't easy, it ain't easy, yeah
So I'm gonna get higher an I'm gonna get higher
Cause it ain't easy, it ain't easy, yeah

[Verse 1: Kerser]
Only god knows why I choose to do what I do
It's like I'm never level headed killing, killing the mood
Or better yet, I'm meant to fill in the truth
It's all I do, I write the truth and I spill it to you
I pop a pill in the booth, I really need to get my head straight
Memories are blank, like why I didn't make tenth grade
I'm getting high and drunk, I'm climbing up and might'n jump
That depends on if you gonna promise that you'll buy me drugs
I enjoy it when they block out the stress
And, for the alcohol, I sip it 'cause it blocks out the rest
I've got no oxygen left, and they screaming at me "wake up"
Ambos at my house, they ask my mates "well, did he take drugs?"
That should draw the line, fuck that, I snort the line
Have I lost my mind? It's safe enough to say it's borderline
I think I'm giving it up-nut, I'm snipping a bud-cunt
While sniffing the dust up, I'm living life fucked up

[Hook: Anthony "Rats" McCarthy]
Gonna get high today
Feeling all my troubles go away
Gonna get high today
Feeling all my troubles go away
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high

[Verse 2: Kerser]
I lost the track of days, like "what's the date?" I'm off my face
I'm wondering if what I say can make a kid go pop today
I gotta say, please don't look up to me, it's nothing nice
My fucking eyes look like they've been in scuffle fights and pumbled twice
But that's the lack of sleep that happens when I'm having E's
Fuck getting scattered, I call Nebs like "let me smash a beat"
While drinking liquor with a Xanny tab, the only way
I'm ever slowing down is if the motor breaks with open flames
I'm broke again and yesterday I had a big wad
Spent it all on drugs and then I bought some kicks, bitch what
A million reasons why I'm off my head, don't question why
I'm wondering if I should even tell them why I'm getting high
The life I'm living got me tripping, sipping, got no chaser
Got no way to ever make it out of getting off my face, I
Take another one, yep, and then break another one's neck
And take the hundreds and jet and waste the money on...yep

[Hook: Anthony "Rats" McCarthy]
Gonna get high today
Feeling all my troubles go away
Gonna get high today
Feeling all my troubles go away
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high

[Verse 3: Kerser]
I show my face, they know their place, I'm riding 'round with gallons
Of that manufactured slapped and battered rapping hazard magic
But, call it medicine, I'm getting off my head again
I'm mentioning, if they gon' fuck my brain, well, then I'm getting 'em
What the fuck? You think I'm sober? I don't ever think that's
Taken place. I made mistakes like lacing cakes with eights of base
So give me more of anything to give my head a buzz
The deadly drugs; I'm getting up with anything they pressing up
Stamp the pill, enhance the deal 'cause I ain't leaving gronk
Reach is long, I punch you in the face and fucking breach my bond
Tell me, I ain't living how I'm spitting, got the proof
I'm watching you, I turn you into something they call (chopped and screwed)
The lot of you are biters, biting out on what I do
I'm getting drunk and high to try and help the stress I gotta move
But that ain't working so I'm back up on my drug shit
A shot of scotch, a shot of vodka, then I got the bud-lit

[Hook: Anthony "Rats" McCarthy]
Gonna get high today
Feeling all my troubles go away
Gonna get high today
Feeling all my troubles go away
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high
H-I, I get high
