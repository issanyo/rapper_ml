Jay Dee, Rates
Oi, what’s up Boobz?
Fuck all mate
South-West

[Verse 1: Rates]
How it started out was kind of hard, we had to craft it out
We walk toward this pub, what we’re after isn’t harder now
There’s no one rhymin’ better ‘cause the writin’s clever
When [?] we strive together, makin’ music, feel the vibe forever
Yes, true, we’re livin’ this, give the skill a lyricist
Spittin’ shit that’s infinitely driven by its viciousness
Vision this, a crew of brothers that’ll stand and say
That they’re listenin’ to what we’ve written and they care today
I hate to break it and the shit’ll change your [?] forever
So I’m makin’ music for my brothers when I’m changin’ and I
Never regret anything or ever replannin’ my life
Spend every dollar I’ve ever earned when inventin’ my rhymes
I’m here and not backin’ down, it’s clear that we’re gonna stay
I’m provin’ we’ve got the ability and Kerser’s on his way
Stand in a place, tear it to shreds in the blaze
The hair stands on the back of your neck, we’re airin’ the rage

[Verse 2: Jay Dee]
In a rap journey, livin’ fine, not turnin’ around
Jay Dee’s bound to work in verse and complete just murder sounds
If you haven’t heard me before, well sure, you’ve heard me now
Keen to record, enjoy it every time I air this out
The things I cared about is pretty much nothin’
Until this something come along and I loved it
Understand, discussin’ subjects, you’re on the mic, makes my life feel kind of like
It’s lighter on the other side, that’s why I find I try to write
Fuck it, tonight, UF’s vibe will make you vibe until
Describin’ me, [?] ever describin’ you
Life’s a bitch and then you die but while I’m livin’ stay alive
Today, what I am in this frame of mind I’m fuckin’ aimin’ high
No I’m not changin’ I am patiently waitin’ to say
What I say on the mic, this ain’t a game, this is my way of life
South-West ready to wreck with the best [?]
To just hit you in your head until you’re there and spray a rhyme

[Chorus: Kerser]
You’re fuckin’ right, this is South-West life
You never knew it till we did it, now we’re out to shine
Now, when we hit it in a minute, you are bound to find
That we’re the sickest spittin’ lyrics, now you’re out of time
‘Cause this it the South-West, the South-West, South-West
The South-West, the South-West, South-West
The South-West, the South-West, South-West
If you fuck around with us, you must be out your mind

[Verse 3: Boobz]
Check mate, I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout a chess game
Now you need an x-ray ‘cause you got a chest pain
I’m the best name, I’m fuckin’ fresh mate
They knew that when they see me in the flesh [?]
I’m in the next [?] gonna make your neck [?]
Like you’re wearin’ x blades, runnin’ on the wet sleigh
No test [?] all you layin’ in your bed grave
Get paid, eshay, I’m leavin’ on a jet plane
Inject pain, eject flames, I get cane
You get canes and yet slave the death plague
Your friends; fake like ten mates that bench weights
I met mates that [?] me out, now my best mate
My drinks taste exactly like a meth pay
You know the boys just like the fuckin’ Nebs bass
They call me Boobz but I ain’t a fuckin’ breast plate
Now it’s your move buddy, stuck ‘cause it’s checkmate

[Verse 4: Kerser]
I travel ‘round where I go, you see me wreckin’ the show
I’m just lettin’ ‘em know I got the hectickest flow
I’ma take tracks and break ‘em, make stacks, amazin’
Eight bags of haze and blaze ‘em on a train, man
Sydney, they be knowin’ the name, they know I flow insane
Only say what I be thinkin’ so you know I quote my pay
I’m down with [?] the search is down with drug pushers
Learners get murdered, it’s Kerser
The truth come, we move up, you knew us
My new bars, that crew’s past, you’re losers
I’m too much for you bruz, you knew but
My two bucks says “you suck, your crew’s fucked”
You know the South-West fuckin’ lads have got the realest vibe
Call my rap [?] and you are guaranteed to feel the night
Takin’ over, breakin’ over, playlist and a beer
Make you know that [?] flow is rippin’ shit at ear

[Chorus: Kerser]
You’re fuckin’ right, this is South-West life
You never knew it till we did it, now we’re out to shine
Now, when we hit it in a minute, you are bound to find
That we’re the sickest spittin’ lyrics, now you’re out of time
‘Cause this it the South-West, the South-West, South-West
The South-West, the South-West, South-West
The South-West, the South-West, South-West
If you fuck around with us, you must be out your mind
You’re fuckin’ right, this is South-West life
You never knew it till we did it, now we’re out to shine
Now, when we hit it in a minute, you are bound to find
That we’re the sickest spittin’ lyrics, now you’re out of time
‘Cause this it the South-West, the South-West, South-West
The South-West, the South-West, South-West
The South-West, the South-West, South-West
If you fuck around with us, you must be out your mind
