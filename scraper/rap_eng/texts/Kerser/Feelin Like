[Intro]
Ay yo NEBS
I'm glad we saved this one for last brother
Yo
Look

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wanna get a shot gun, close range
Ending it all fuck I hope there ain't no pain
Then my families fucked and all messed up
Is this depression or the lesson that the drugs fuck?
I've been hitting shit since I hit 13
Whatever we could get pop a roofie if its dirt cheap
Then I made it in rap ain't that your dream bro?
When you picture it its nothing what it seems though
Constant threats so I'm buying guns
With the shit I spend on that I should supply my mum
A new car or somethin' I threw stacks at Rates
We both the same so that went to waste
I got a massive house and a luxury car
My girl screaming at me I don't know who you are
No excuse but the fame and the drug mix
With the cash turned me into to a fuck wit
I'm sorry

[Hook]
I don't wanna live my life no more
I ain't wanna be a victim of the shoot out wall
I ain't wanna be known as a tripped out lost cunt
Got my freedom but it's feeling like I'm locked up
I don't wanna live my life no more
I ain't wanna be a victim of the shoot out wall
I ain't wanna be known as a tripped out lost cunt
Got my freedom but it's feeling like I'm locked up

[Verse 2]
I got what I want, why the fuck I feel this?
It ain't Kers if I ain't spit the real shit
I've seen the bitter shit that's why I give you bad stares
I try and block but the memories are trapped there
Got money coming trust me that ain't bring happiness
Tell that Pharrell that fuckin' song is a batch of shit
Growing up kids were searching through a clothing bin
I see 'em lately and they say waddup they don't don't whinge
I'm just gonna fuckin' spill my heart
Hate me or love me I've been real from the start
What you know about a mate almost comatose?
I need you here and I'm worried you will overdose
Cos you the back bone to this shit you're gonna need help
Who am I to talk? I'm sleeping with a seat belt
As a pillow in the passenger seat
Fell asleep halfway through I was having a feed
I need help

[Hook]
I don't wanna live my life no more
I ain't wanna be a victim of the shoot out wall
I ain't wanna be known as a tripped out lost cunt
Got my freedom but it's feeling like I'm locked up
I don't wanna live my life no more
I ain't wanna be a victim of the shoot out wall
I ain't wanna be known as a tripped out lost cunt
Got my freedom but it's feeling like I'm locked up

[Verse 3]
I hadn't seen a mate for a couple of months
I seen him and it hurt he was fucking it up
And it broke my heart more cos his bro was on the pipe too
The same kid that looked up to us at high school
I said I wanna chat and fix the prob
One ear out the other can I speak to God?
If you listenin' help in some way or form
It's like holding aerials on planes in storms
Someone's gettin' struck every bodies running mucks
Ice will make your best friend wanna fuck you up
The tabs I've popped probably killing my liver
Pain stops sprite so my body don't shiver
I need guidance I ain't gonna hide shit
I hope what I'm saying don't lead to violence
I had enough of that coppers tryna lock me up
Fuck 'em Imma make my music and pop my drugs

[Hook]
I don't wanna live my life no more
I ain't wanna be a victim of the shoot out wall
I ain't wanna be known as a tripped out lost cunt
Got my freedom but it's feeling like I'm locked up
I don't wanna live my life no more
I ain't wanna be a victim of the shoot out wall
I ain't wanna be known as a tripped out lost cunt
Got my freedom but it's feeling like I'm locked up

[Outro]
And whatever I said in this track
It isn't meant to bring you down
You need to find the positive in it
We as a society need help
This is just what I see
Imma march on
Stand tall
Kerser
We out
