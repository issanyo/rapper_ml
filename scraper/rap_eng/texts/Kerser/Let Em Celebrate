[Hook: Anthony “Rats” McCarthy]
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em celebrate
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em celebrate
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em celebrate
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em cele-celebrate

[Verse 1: Kerser]
I’ve made it through, I can’t believe I’ve got a style now
I can’t believe I’ve got a fuckin’ phone that dials out
I can’t believe I’m on a plane across the country
I celebrate the fact that people dreamin’ just to touch me
See me as a teen, fuck, live life as a cheap cunt
I open up my eyes, I’m surprised, is this a dream? Nah
I’m lovin’ the fan love, I struggle to stand up
My sunnies on, on every drug, you motherfuckers can touch
Growin’ up, no repeat, every meal, we reheat
Mum did her best but never seen what we see
Dirty coppers hate that I ain’t been in a cell
Livin’ life like a Saturday, I’ve been through the hell
If you knew me back then, then it’s all from the heart
If you only know me know, then we off to a start
Cigar with a wine glass, come on baby, find us
Let us fuckin’ celebrate, trip out like my mind does

[Pre-Hook: Anthony “Rats” McCarthy]
I live my life like a Saturday
I pour my drink up and celebrate
All my bad days have gone away
So let me hear my people say

[Hook: Anthony “Rats” McCarthy]
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em celebrate
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em celebrate
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em celebrate
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em cele-celebrate

[Post-Hook: Anthony “Rats” McCarthy]
Let me hear them, let me hear them, let me hear them say
Let 'em cele-cele-cele-celebrate
Let me hear them, let me hear them, let me hear them say

[Interlude: Nebs]
Yeah
Yo, wait a minute
I’m…

[Verse 2: Nebs]
Feelin’ magnificent, kickin’ back, sippin’ drink
This is that different shit lad, listen in
I’ve got the Jim Beam, nicotine and I’m feelin’ mean
Straight celebratin’ ‘cause I made it out the prison greens
I’m on the winnin’ team, forget that shit I’ve seen
Now they check my beats ‘cause they’re tighter than your skinny jeans
Every day, I celebrate in every way, forget the pain
I set it straight, I’m here to win, fuck second place
N-E-B's smiling, put my drink up in the air
You bitches, you can whinge about the shit that isn’t fair
Bruz, I’m lookin’ at the finish line, their vision is impaired
And I’m gifted with these lyrics and the shit I spit is rare
I’m sayin' good morning, livin’ life like a Saturday
If you treat me right, I might greet you with a happy face
If you try and lie, try and stitch, that’s the faggot way
N-E-B’s the type of guy to write a rhyme, kick back and say

[Pre-Hook: Anthony “Rats” McCarthy]
I live my life like a Saturday
I put my drink up and celebrate
All my bad days have gone away
So let me hear my people say

[Hook: Anthony “Rats” McCarthy]
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em celebrate
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em celebrate
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em celebrate
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em cele-celebrate

[Post-Hook: Anthony “Rats” McCarthy]
Let me hear them, let me hear them, let me hear them say
Let me hear them, let 'em cele-cele-celebrate
Let me hear them, let me hear them, let me hear them say
Let me hear them, let 'em cele-cele-celebrate

[Interlude: Kerser]
Got the bottle popped
Yeah, cigar lit
Celebrate
Right

[Verse 3: Kerser]
Came a long way, never thought I would
Never thought I could but I fought, it’s good
We made it through, now we laughin’ at ‘em
Got half a gallon of the harshest Fallon
[?] that’s the only loss
Livin’ my life, I’m the only boss
Drinkin’ a [?] thinkin’ this is life
Now I look back like “shit this is nice”
Hundred buck notes in a hundred stack
Ideas: give that to my mum and dad
That’s my aim, yeah, I raise the bar
As I race this car to displace these stars
Sixteen, yeah, with my backpack strapped
Told them all back then that I rapped that phat
Tat, tat, tat, on the door again
When the mornin’ ends and I crawl in bed
And I thought I said I fought the best
Life had to offer when it tore my chest
Got a good girl who I love and need
And I love to see, this love’s for free
Celebrate, yeah, happy as fuck
And I’m wrappin’ it up with an actual punch
Liquor in the mix, now I’m set to ride
From my left to right, I got extra high
Next in line so fix me up
With a mixed in bud in a sipped [?] cup
[?] when I bust this shit
Hatin’ on me, you can suck this dick
Must admit, times still get tough
But I got a strong mind so I will step up
Party time with a master mind
Hook so dope that you cast a line

[Pre-Hook: Anthony “Rats” McCarthy]
I live my life like a Saturday
I put my drink up and celebrate
All my bad days have gone away
So let me hear my people say

[Hook: Anthony “Rats” McCarthy]
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em celebrate
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em celebrate
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em celebrate
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em cele-celebrate

[Outro: Anthony “Rats” McCarthy]
Let me hear them, let me hear them, let me hear them say
Let me hear them, let 'em cele-cele-celebrate
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em celebrate
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em celebrate
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em celebrate
Let ‘em celebrate, let ‘em cele-celebrate
