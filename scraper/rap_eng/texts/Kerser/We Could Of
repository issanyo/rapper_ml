Say I’m selling out?
Well let me see
Only thing that’s selling out is my CD
And not a sell out like I’m selling out for more
I mean sell out like it’s selling out of stores
I am pure, wasn’t made by the man
Mother fucker ask around I was made by the fans
And I just woke up with a spliff to roll
Make ‘em cry to my shit
Cause I hit the soul
And I ain't like any Aussie rapper that you heard
I come from nothing, blood and sweat till I made it work
And I’m so so proud, should I be of myself?
They used to laugh and act better now they needing my help
But I fly so high and it’s just begun
Work hard, it pays off I should have trust my mum
Now I’m in the position where I can’t be stopped
So confident with haters now I laugh them off
They are suckers, I’m the man
And they be knowing that it’s true
And if they say they don’t know
Well then you knowing that they knew
See all my fans are crazy so I guess we all the same
Cause my music’s like a drug and now it’s damaging your brain
Look into my eyes can you see the pain
See the bags under them, that’s no sleep for days
But I can’t feel alone cause the fans relate
Plus I just hit the stage and I can’t stand straight
Wait, wait, you know that I’ve got this
Rip apart my brain just to find you a top bit
Ask my boys “Are you happy with life?”
They say yes, but in the streets you gotta carry a knife
If you shake your head well get the fuck aware
You ain't been out here, you wouldn’t understand
You in your nice mansion yea you’ve lost your shit
That’s why kids around here come and rob your shit
You never gave a helping hand so what the fuck you expect
But now I got the money coming Ima take all I can get
Ima take it till I’m dead
Get my family fed
And everyone that’s near me, get them standing again
Tell me who can get you in the vibe
To feel so high you ain't even need a pipe
That’s why addicts use this when they can’t get on
It’s like a free hit here gotta pass the bong
Yea pass it round, I’m the master now
I will never ever stop, see me passin out
Then I wake back up, still all about rap
It’s on my mind all the time like I’m stuck in a trap
What the fuck is a fact
When I give you my life
Without the rap probably be another victim to ice
Why you listening right?You see the shit in my eyes
I give my fans everything
Never think to disguise
So I’m poppin codeine so fresh so clean
Skinny mother fucker still be making hoes scream
Tell me who can wait, nah not again
If I could swap weed smoke for oxygen
It’d be done, we be walking round smashed as fuck
Doing interviews on phones while I’m hackin bud
I ain't acting bruz
This is what you get
Ain't denying shit
I am off my head
