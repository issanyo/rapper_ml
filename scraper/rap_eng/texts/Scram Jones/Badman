[Hook]
No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
No one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be faded
To telling only lies

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E]
You see they dissed me in that resource room, a special ed classic
Now I make special bread, special bastard
Taught to believe I couldn't achieve, and wasn't smart enough
Couldn't be a lawyer, but a carpenter
What they installed in my head, I feel braindead
Said I should just work with my hands because my brain dead
Said "Mr. Santiago, you could never be a doctor
You could never be a judge, you don't even speak proper
Probably gonna be a boxer, athlete or something like"
Disability, my A.D.D. was something like
Thoughts in a straitjacket, brain's in a wheelchair
Feeling like I'm handicapped, still feel I'm still there
Break it down for you niggas through the syllables
Paint a picture for you motherfuckers through the visual
While some niggas, wind up dead in hospitables
Little niggas grow up fast to hard criminals

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Somehow, we supposed to make it out this bitch
Either coke or hoops, and my jump shot ain't shit
I'm no athlete, but I can make the cocaine flip
On the back street, got smokers running in like a track meet
Stress'll take a young nigga and give him a old face
Or stress'll take a dumb nigga and give him a new case
Foolish pride, before I beg, I tighten my lace
Get that thing out the dresser, put you niggas under pressure like
You pay me or pay the funeral home
Nigga, what you expected?
Get mine or get nekkid
I bang out like an old Western
Stickups and killings to fix the leaks in my ceilings
Cause being broke at 30 giving niggas the chills
And when you broke your kids hungry and they eating no frills
Before I turn in my cards and fold
Man, I'm gon play that bad guy role
Nigga, that's all I know

[Hook]
