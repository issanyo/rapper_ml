I don't want to sound mad, though
I don't want to sound mad
I feel marvelous
Dirty Money

Tell that bitch with the crown to run it like Chris Brown
She run three rounds I'mma need a hundred thou
Like Chinatown bitches better bow down
Oh you ain't know? Bet you bitches know now
Fuck I gotta done to let them know that I'm the one
Way I ride the drum they salute me in the slum
In the six hun, the color of bubblegum
I'm with my nigga Spits and my nigga Bun'Crum
Yes I'm the one, I'm the motherfuckin' one
Hold more weight than the late Big Pun
Bitches talk slick but they ain't saying none
Mad 'cause I'm bad, two sticks in my bun

Yes sir, look what I've done!
They r-run run when I come
Bun stickity bun, let me tell you where I'm from
Queens, lil' Mama, go buy us some nice pumps
