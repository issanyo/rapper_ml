[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Crooked I]
Guess who's back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Hoes recognize, niggas do too

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Guess who's back and I'm working on the clock - say bro
It's crooked I, got 'em jerking on the block - they know
The coupe Prego, convertible the top - aiyoo
Your goons lay low, I murder with a Glock - fatal
I'd rather fuck with some bitches
But these haters love drama, guess it comes with the riches
And all my thugs with the business
In the club wit'cha misses
Love the hugs and the kisses
My rap money in my right hand (get 'em)
My trap money in my left hand (get 'em)
You can get married to crime, I'll be the best man
I'm in and out of the game
Proud of the power that came
You cowards out of your brain
Uhh, Scram Jones is bringing the speaker crack out
Stop the beat, Long Beach! Bring it back now

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Crooked I]
Guess who's back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Guess who's back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Hoes recognize, niggas do too


[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Yeah, hoes recognize, niggas do too - really
A few - milli; the boy hustle too silly
And new giddy, some real dudes move with me
Goon city, Bad Boy, new Diddy
Rrah! Rrrah! What the bloodclaat?
I wanna see that ass popping when the drums drop
Rrrah! Rrah! Keep your guns cocked
My Cali niggas smoking kush 'till they lungs stop
Illegal money in my right hand (get 'em)
But legal money in my left hand (get 'em)
Look at the ice on my hype man
That's C.O.B., we at the check stand
And tell the fans eat a dick
My grind is sick with it
I'm just trying to be legit
I'm a rider, I'm the kind you need to get
I'm the guy to lead the ship
I'm just trying to be the shit

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Crooked I]
Guess who's back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Guess who's back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Hoes recognize, niggas do too

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Guess who's back in the motherfucking house illin'
A wild villain, fresh to death, my style killin'
Drought fillin', new Ferrari without ceilin'
Your souse willin', my dick's in her mouth chillin'
You're now fucking with the braveheart
When you hear pow pow, that's my trademark
I gotta get it for my homies in the graveyard
I hear 'em yelling ''Crook, you better hit the game hard''
Label money in my right hand (get 'em)
Under-the-table money in my left hand (get 'em)
Build a small fortune with my grind man
But Rubin and Simmons was smarter cause they built Def Jam
Inspire me to take bigger steps
Fans rather see me shoot guns on the internet
Rappers beefing in public, where's the intellect?
Talking 'bout killing each other, why you ain't did it yet?

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Crooked I]
Guess who's back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Guess who's back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Guess who's back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Guess who's back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
