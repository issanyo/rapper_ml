Who, you?
You ain't cool
Hell nah
You?

[Verse 1]
You ride around in the Benz with the shiny rims
The same one on the bedroom wall of little Jamal
He wanna be just like you, he want the motorcycle
The rifle, the culture cipher you guzzle
The wives that you juggle
Yeah, he hear about the pies that you smuggle
Yet all he see is the glamor
Give a damn about the lives that you trouble
Get ready for little you
You creating a fool
He even heard that you be fucking with wolves
But still think you so
Cool

You need to be taking shorty to school
You ain't cool
You's a motherfucking fool
You need to be dropping shorty some jewels
You ain't cool

[Verse 2]
You in the studio rapping how you gon make it rain
You need to ask the man in the mirror to make a change
You rocking red and soo wooing like you relate to gangs
You ain't banging, you be hanging down at the Laker game
These rap niggas the definition of tough herbs
When they rhyming they turn to hustlers, quick to bust birds
See em in they video wilding, spitting cuss words
Director yell cut, turn back to a bitch with a dust nerve
It'd be easy to make this sucka take his chain off
Just to prove to him we ain't cut from the same cloth
You the white man's mule, just a popular fool
Supposed to be using hip hop as a tool
You ain't cool

You play the game but you don't play by the rules
That ain't cool
Man, you's a motherfucking fool
The ghetto's on fire, you adding the fuel
That ain't cool
Nah
Check

[Verse 3]
You on the television bragging bout your better living
How you the wife of a baller and you get recognition
You know being independent's a much better decision
You groupies the reason niggas lose respect for the women
And all these reality shows that expose
These women for who they are, and make em look like hoes
A shame what a bitch'll do for some views
For sleeping with dudes
You think you win but as a people we lose
That ain't cool

Can't have my daughters looking up to a flooz
That ain't cool
You's a motherfucking fool
Put your value in some red bottom shoes
That ain't cool

Check, check it out
Yes
Saigon
Yeah yeah, good guy gang
We here to stay
Scram Jones, Saigon, we back
Kicking reality rap
Nahmsayin it ain't ever gon stop, good guy gang
Ha ha, S to the
