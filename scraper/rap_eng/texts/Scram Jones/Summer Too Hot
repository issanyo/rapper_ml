[Intro: Samuel L. Jackson]
Doing the yin and the yang, the hip and the hop
The stupid fresh thing, the flippity-flop
I have today's forecast for you - hot

[Hook x6: Kanye West]
Man, the summer too hot, you can feel it in the street

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Summertime chrome nine, gotta watch my back
Weathers warm, liquor in him, don't know how to act
Kush burnin', bottles poppin', homie that's a fact
Top down, we don't know you, homie, getting jacked
Crime rate going up, police can't take it
Weaves sweatin' out, these bitches out here gettin' naked
Parkin' lot turned to clubs until somebody barks
Now they bustin' slugs, that's what weather does
Ha - and they rattin' on whoever
(3rd floor right now, you'll find 'em there together)
It's hotter in a cell, C.O.s know him well
Zimmerman, time will tell it's hotter down in Hell

[Hook x6]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
You ain't gotta do much, they gon' feel it if it's real
You can feel it in the street, they can feel it in the jails
Need the gas mask on when you put it on the scale
Latex gloves so it don't get under your nails
Got the top off, now you got the doors off too
Let your titties out baby, take your drawers off too
Do a background check, I'ma boss all through
Anything you prolly heard about the God is all true
I got one or two spots, but this summer's too hot
For me to be sitting around worry 'bout what you got
Rather be on a upper deck of a new yacht
Getting blacker than I already am
Don't gotta try to be that nigga cause I'm already him
Wipe smirk off, you got the fan in the window dryin' your work off
Something's gon' happen, you can feel it in the heat
Man, the summer too hot you can feel it in the street

[Hook x6]

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Summer's too hot, you can feel it in the streets
Wearing high-top Nike's socks, knew I was elite
Almost had twins, I could feel it in the skeet
Playing the Isley Brothers in between the sheets
On the paper chase, I've been up about a week
When it come to getting money, nigga, I don't even sleep
All I need it two sheets, nigga, I don't need a leaf
Throw a pound on the table, tell all my niggas to chief
L-O-X shit is the best shit
Money by the entrance, money by the exit
And I'm always on that next shit
Uninvited nigga on the V.I.P. guest list

[Hook]
