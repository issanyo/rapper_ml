Immortal Technique

Born of apocalypse, the birth of the beast
Released on the ghetto like it was the curse of the streets
The reversal of peace, murder in the first will increase
Snake police state, globally...holding my peeps
The rise of the Fourth Reich and corporate classism
The evolution of institutional fascism
Cuz honest people die for they country and they religion
While the most corrupt orchestrate the world that we live in
You see the future was a promise, the man is prophecy
That shit is a product of the action behind philosophy
The end of the world is the end of the Age of Pisces
The Book of the Dead was re-read as gen-ISIS
The standard of apocalypse broken and cut open
Disease ridden man-made murder its soft spoken
Cloaking the globe, blood soaking is written in code
Stockpile nuclear weapons, the weight that we sold...
