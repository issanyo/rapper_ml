KILLA!
Lemme write a note, my cats the type to tote (tote)
They love me but my connect, HA he'll slice ya throat  (I swear)
He'll tie a rope, throw you off his nicest boat
Made him $30 mill when $30 a gram was the price of coke
Think my life a joke? (joke?), I been indicted folks
Do I like it? Nope I'm under a microscope
A paid lawyer and word to mother it's nice to know
I been told I got a psychic slash sniper flow  (that's dangerous!)
I'm the shit, shit I should rock a diaper yo
No homo though, a few things I'd like to know (what?)
Like who the best, who the worst, who the greatest is?
Who needs some work in the hood, what's the latest and...
We rock foreign cars, spaceship modern taste
"Trailer load", lot of thanks, "Shabba Ranks"
Ed Moffa gang, don't forget the Kuffa Gang
Who got the bluest chain, two coupes moving lanes?
... IT'S THE SET BABAAAAY! Disrespect...
We pull tecs, live... IN THE FLESH BABAAAAY!
Beefing you want it, get deep and I done it
Imma smack you with a c-note since you keep a hunned
Ha Ha... Blood Debiase, skully, beef and brocolli's
Only manero you know that could compete with papi
That's Jaffe, yeah Jaffe Joe
Y'all "Sloppy Joe", 10 4 copy ho!

Y'ALL CAN'T LIVE HIS LIFE... Y'ALL CANT LIIIIIIIIIIIVE HIS LIIIIFE!
Y'ALL CAN'T LIVE HIS LIFE... Y'ALL CANT LIIIIIIIIIIIVE HIS LIIIIFE!
Y'ALL CAN'T LIVE HIS LIFE... Y'ALL CANT LIIIIIIIIIIIVE HIS LIIIIFE!
Y'ALL CAN'T LIVE HIS LIFE... Y'ALL CANT LIIIIIIIIIIIVE HIS LIIIIFE!

[Cam'Ron: Verse 2]
I'm in the Zoo every night B
Come through in the white tee, icey
But watch wifey... "oooh I Think She Like Me"
I own liquor, fast money can't come finer
Me and Jim sold more Sizzurp (Syrup) than Aunt Jemima!
Get what we want, Albuquerque to V-Mont
Chi-town, Ohio, back to East Treemont
Diddy bop in Frinks, cop a army jacket
Back to the crib... get my army ratchet (ready for war!)
Mac milly clips, black act silly dick
Hat clapped, cat face looking like a Philly split
Control the baddest bitties, "Strokers" to "Magic City"
I'll stroke her, poke her, provoke her, grab her titties
Get crucially crucial, hit the "Pool Palace"
"112", "Visions", see my dude Alice
D.I.P, V.I.P, where we post up
Girls Going Wild, shiiit put them ropes up!
Don't act boo believe me I'll smack you
Now nice girls come on and let the trap through
My ice varies, canaries in the raw
I got niggas shook, hands scary when they form
And... "I Be, I Be, I Be On That Kryptonite"
Mami mami her lips are white, ooh she sucking dick tonight
Now hit the crew off Drama, Duke Da God
She want the head like Dahmer, mama stupid hard

[HOOK]
Y'ALL CAN'T LIVE HIS LIFE... Y'ALL CANT LIIIIIIIIIIIVE HIS LIIIIFE!
Y'ALL CAN'T LIVE HIS LIFE... Y'ALL CANT LIIIIIIIIIIIVE HIS LIIIIFE!
Y'ALL CAN'T LIVE HIS LIFE... Y'ALL CANT LIIIIIIIIIIIVE HIS LIIIIFE!
Y'ALL CAN'T LIVE HIS LIFE... Y'ALL CANT LIIIIIIIIIIIVE HIS LIIIIFE!
