[Verse 1: Styles P]
The small talk is irrelevant, gonna kill an elephant
Niggas look fly and their bitches look elegant
Let the birds fly like a pelican from NY up to Maryland
Be more careful, them little niggas will ear you
Tattoo tears over here, if you dare to, yeah
Wax out the trippy, wax off the other shit
Max with the hippies, mac out the window
If niggas will act iffy, M's off the piffy
Shit is getting sticky like Jiffy
Hood gon' cry, if they hit me
I'm a real ass nigga, get with me
Cushion to grind and my look is designed
And my dope is raw like it got cooked in China
Always on some other shit, even the hating niggas is loving it

[Hook 2x]
Even the hating niggas is loving it (Even the haters love it!)
Even the hating niggas is loving it (Bullshit too!)
Even the hating niggas is loving it (Word!)
Fuck all the ho ass niggas and fuck the government

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Haters still loving it, but I don't give a fuck if they didn't
I'm black loving it, poppin' off of some other shit
Hand on the tommy, couple of shooters behind me
They trying to take the black man out like Mitt Romney
Me and P, add Kiss too and it's 3D (L-O-X!)
IMAX movie, shine on our watchers is dookey
They love my style, alligator band on a hublot
True Religions on, Louis kicks, all on a big toe (You see me?)
You don't think I've seen a million dollars? I did though
Christopher Wallace money, every night is a big show
Hit the gym, back looking fucking for Indo
Dundun, bitch been on my dick from the get-go

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: Styles P]
It's crack or gat for the dollars
Ride around town in a black Impala
Niggas can act wild or show a bitch a mile script
Same ass guns to send an actor to valor
Sort of like the car that gave me no hope
I'm real rugged yet smoother than the bean old soap
I mean body wash, upon the shore is where his body was
It wasn't me, I was smoking weed with his bodyguard
I'm not feeling you, probably made a plan on killing
You ain't rap, nigga I'm willing to, I'm a mile boss
All day, part of it for departing, I'm like John fold tape
Where P goes is liquid, connect seeds solid though
Any sign of the feds, motherfucking bombing those
Whole court on the streets before I do 24 years
Being broke is the only thing money fears

[Hook 2x]
