[Verse:]
Angry man speaking Spanish
Diablo B
Diablo B
Get low with the swords
Samurai shit
My shit
Acoustic
Acostic
Punch him in his face if he botch it
While he clock ostrich
Toxic
Boxes
Ship him to the tropics
Diablo B
This ain’t twitter don’t follow me
I have you clowns face down like a robbery
Bust in a Rilla’ once split that wid weed
Smoke pounds, ounces every hourly
Diablo B
Might as well call me Nacho Libre Guapo
Friend name Guapo
And he keep top-o
Eat mad pussy so it’s rich call em taco
Used to fuck wid her get me hard like a rocko
Diablo B
Whoo
So you can catch me at the winery
I’m a boss nigga
Ain’t near a nigga signing me
Otra vino
Benz with the seat recliner
Tank top draws and socks that’s all designer
Diablo B

[Sample
A punch to the face
But you cannot do it
Because it is in the bible not to wrestle your neighbour]

[Verse 2:]
Uhh yow
Destruction is with the true religion
G Star button up
You pillow talking to hoes
See you niggas, cuddle up
You get drunk just to talk shit
I get drunk but it’s ball shit
Flow like a faucet
Diablo B
Rolex, kush, [?] and amnesia
You smoked with an afro, left with a ceasar
He came wid his wife but he left with a skeezer
Smoked with a white girl, he call her the new Viva
Diablo B
I see now everybody’s sniffing coke a lot
They hit wax everybody wanna choke a lot
I’ve been smoking buds since the shit came in chocolat
Since bamboo and Philly blunts too
Diablo B
I [?] down with the street shit
I’m an ol’ G, it ain’t a secret
In Chicago get my pizza with the deep dish
When you see this
Yell this
Diablo B

[Movie Sample:]
So you’ve never?
Me? No, c’mon
Don’t be crazy
Listen I know the wrestlers get all the fancy ladies
And the clothes, and the fancy creams and lotions
But my life is good!
Really good!
I get to wake up every morning, at 5AM, and make some soup!
It's the best
I love it!
I get to lay in a bed, all by myself, all of my life!
That's fantastic!
Now Go
Go away!
Read some books! (echoes)
