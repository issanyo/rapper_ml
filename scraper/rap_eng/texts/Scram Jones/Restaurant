[Intro: Raekwon]
Fig Newtons is murder, right?
Them shits is good
Some strawberry milk, I'm good

[Hook 1]
I see you every morning, outside the restaurant
The music plays so nonchalant

[Verse 1]
You's a dead nigga
Why'd ya lie to me, everything I own, I gave it to you, word
You tried to get me, saw all your hating
You Once Upon A Time In America'd me
Now jump inside the garbage truck, B
And I been thinking, plus bagging these cakes
You dry and stink and lost all connection, you weakling
Pussy ass coward, rat face nigga
Snake in the grass, I would've gave my last dollar to blast you
What's up, nigga?
Future cadet, how much pussy you get?
You lost all that right now, you look dead
And I been chilling, counting money, living humble
You live one spot now, hungry starving, broke, still arguing, dissing [?]
I told you nigga, you can't stop my glow, my motto is arsonist
Guns is nothing, blunts we puffin'
Throw a bunch of dots on your head
Wipe that smile off, fuck you, yo
And I...

[Hook]
I see you every morning, outside the restaurant

[Verse 2]
In juniors we would bag bitches
Pull us, a little Nikes
I knew a bitch that spit your tuna--we was tight
Yeah we robbed niggas together
Trade chains, this the same thing
Yeah I pawned off my ring finger for four sweaters
I felt like a surfer, flying uptown
Bringing Cubans up: don't bring your man, he a worker
I stayed pollying for hours, drug talk
This is a thug's walk, you skipped out the door for flowers
Said I trust, should've threw my gun up and bust you
Everything I earned, I should've burned, I fucks with you
Wasn't loyal like oil, big coil
Crazy connected with a string I mad ringers who'd kill for you
But now you target, take my a little pig wet Audemars and time yourself fast, you started, boo

This niggas' a fucking girl
Bitch ass nigga

[Hook 1]
