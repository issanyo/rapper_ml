[Intro]
(I should be your girl)
(Your girl, your girl)

[Verse 1]
See, I used to be so shy
Sit at home and fantasize (I should be your girl)
But I ain't wastin' no more time
'Cause I've got to make you mine

[Chorus]
I'm gonna make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm gonna put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm gonna show you clearly, I can rock your world
You're gonna know for sure
That I should be your girl

[Verse 2]
(Your girl, your girl)
See, I used to be afraid
But now baby, I can't wait (I should be your girl)
I just got to have your love
And enough's enough's enough

[Chorus]
I'm gonna make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm gonna put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm gonna show you clearly, I can rock your world
You're gonna know for sure
That I should be your girl
Baby, I should be your girl

[Bridge]
(Your girl, your girl)
(I should be your girl)
(Your girl, your girl)
Baby
(Your girl, your girl)
(I should be your girl)
I'm gonna be your girl

[Chorus]
I'm gonna make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm gonna put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm gonna show you clearly, I can rock your world
You're gonna know for sure
That I should be your girl
