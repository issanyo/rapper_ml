(Verse 1)
What's really good, homie? Be gracious, my nigga it's nothin
Gizzardheads cluckin', every other day niggas is buckin'
It's Baby G, tryin to put my coat and put me on to somethin'
Heard the Word of Mouf, niggas on the other side stuntin'
Said you gettin' rich, left the hood style switched up
You wealthy, they wanna get you stitched up and sticked up
He said you know I'm ridin' wit you, cuz I don't give a fuck
I'm thinkin to myself, why these savages wanna force hand
I ain't got time for this shit, plus I'm a grown man
I fell back, 745 gray I
He must of read my mind, when he looked me dead in my eye
And said: 'send the wolves at 'em, see if niggas really wanna die'
I know your style, you's an O-G, and you don't stress that
The Only thing they know, where yo baby mom's rest at

(Verse 2)
Yo, yo, yo
We now up in a building, I'm stuck, really not knowin'
That's when shorty turned his gun on me, then he started blowin'
I started leakin, hearin niggas comin down the stairs speakin
Barely movin, fadin in and out, but I'm still breathin
Old ladies peakin out the windows callin precincts
This little nigga set me up, contemplatin' the reasons
Snake thug, funny how I showed this nigga love
Made my way out, I jumped in my V, covered in blood
Felt my neck, ?? must of caught me in a scuffle
I'm losin blood rapidly, I know I'm in trouble
My vision blurry as I drive, gotta make it out the 'Bridge
Know too much about these niggas, they can't let me live
But fuck it, I'm not dyin, back rounds, I hear sirens
That's when I black out, ran the curb and hit the hydren

(Verse 3)
In my eyesight, seein' white lights, my life flashes
Funny, how these niggas tried to murder my ass
They set me up, like we never did dirt in the past
And ICU, sign myself out the hospital fast
Handle my handle, my man's pull up, guns in his stash
Loaded weapons on the Grand Central, hit the hood in 60 seconds
Fuck, niggas slept on the God, like I was never reppin'
Make a right, 40th Ave., that's when I smile and laugh
Load my techs three quarters down, that's when the guns blast
Black glove, black mask, rappidly buckin
Love is love, niggas guns blowin, homie its nothin
Got these cowards hoppin over fences, runnin and duckin
Four pound, have them chokin on blood, huggin the ground
When my niggas grabbed both arms and turned him around
Looked him in his eyes, cocked back and finally laced him
Coward ass, I'm a lay em fast, send him to Satan

(Outro)
Oh oh oh oh...here we go..
AK-47, the very best days
When you absolutely, positively gotta kill every motherfucker in the room
Accept no substitute
