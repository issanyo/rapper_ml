[Intro]
Hold it now… Hit it!

[Verse: Rhymefest]
Let’s start with the main course, of course
Medium steak with some nice red sauce
Italian bread, the house salad, what’s tossed
Pour the Cabernet, mhm, I’m the boss
Got big dreams so I like nice things
Bought a golf course, now I drive on the green
Bought a Lear jet, and now I ride on the wing
Flying through the air like, “Money ain’t a thang!”
Light the cigar, fireplace by the bar
The models at the airport? Send ‘em the cars
Get a couple pills and send ‘em to Mars
Don’t ask me how I’m living, ‘cause yo, I’m living large
I don’t yell, don’t raise my voice
I just talk low and drink top choice
Ride around the hood with all my boys
Got the neighbors yelling, “Turn down that noise!”
