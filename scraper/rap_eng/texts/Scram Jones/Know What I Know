I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean
Know what I mean

I was told to always stand straight, give a firm handshake
Don’t sign a thing, until you get someone to translate
Don’t be in the kitchen, If you know the heat you can’t take
Don’t depend on living, eating off another mans plate
Wake up smell the coffee, get your own pancakes, get your own fan base, get your own damn place
See to many cats, get caught up in the rap race
Turn a good look, into a bad break
Life moves at a fast pace, they say a miss is as good as a mile, meaning number two is the same as last place
And you don’t get to press backspace, just because the grass is greener doesn’t mean it doesn’t have mass stakes
Food for thought'll leave a bad taste, and when the beef is getting cooked you may not know your life is at stake
I’m trying to see food in the clambake, while these dudes jumped out the window and get cut when the glass breaks

I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean
Know what I mean

They say the best things in life come to those who wait, but if you wait to long it may be to late
They say the best things in life are free, but my .. bill is telling me I owe a G
They say money is the rule to all evil, I guess that really means the we are all evil people
They say we are all created equal, but my great-grandmother couldn’t vote cause she was female
The say you gotta role with the punches, probably that’s the reason why I roll all these dutchess
They say you shoulda hold on the grudges, you should be a rolling rock but don’t roll with the luggage
They say you should turn negatives to positive, if something sounds to good to be true then it probably is
Do what you do is your prerogative, all I’m trying to do is let you know what the logic is

I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean
