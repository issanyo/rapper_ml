[VERSE - 1]
I prove it – Rock it like a crew ship –
Lock me in the cage and ima hit you with new shit –
Fully equipped with rounds - shots down your throat -
Appeared on this planet like a ninja in a cloud of smoke –
Bitch –
You can't fuck with the Cali kid –
New west new hiphop im on dat cali shit –
Im in Venice - Bong rips at the cliniks –
Bad bitches and pimping go like cocain in the kitchen –
While you wishin - Im getting twisted with centerfolds and bad bitches -
Ask the misses - I tell her bag’em for me – My girl gotta girlfriend –
Only kuz she horny – If you ain't bout yo business all you other bitches bore me –
Break down a pound and hit the block in the morning –
Chopping the beat - Releasing the heat - Make you fade like Alonzo Mourning –
My name reach glory – While you ho niggas swagger jack –
My money in the duffle - Got my paper on flap jack –
Nine in my lap - With the tommy right up under that –
You can test the kid and hear’em roar like a thunder cat –
Hand on the rock - Hold it tight like a running back –
And all you non believers put your genre’s in my death trap-
