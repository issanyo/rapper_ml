This the story of Osama
Allahu akbar in Uganda
Niggas put me on to the drama
Now sit back, it's on with the data
A boy from Saudi Arabia who had it made
But he hated the... fortune, glamour, the fame, the game
An Oxford graduate, he rather see the sun when it rain
He studied economics, Islamic, drink tonic, hate chronic
Didn't hate America, he hated the Congress
Old daddy died when he was ten
These are powerful men
Who had paper, slinging oil and men
Wealthy, religious, and educated?
Ay yo this made lots of bread
Family been straight since cavemen
Three wives at 17
Now it gets better, his team
Yeah it's time to form the mujahideen
War hero legend for the Muslims, by any means
Reminds me of Farrakhan, Malcolm, and King
Play boss who had driving for show
His plans was well written
So the kid slid to Sudan
Had a couple vans some land
Few good religious brothers did all his prayers with him
Giving him grams
It was Afghanistan, he had training camp, smash
Jumping out of mid sized Toyotas with hash in 'em
Fly turbans, Suburbans, sandals on, swervin'
Jumping off of camels, eating turkey and lamb
Blood brothers, holy warriors, the others wore covers
Fuck buying jewelry, let's explore, bring the luggage
They shot to Tora Bora with no order
300 degrees out one glass a water, for four of us
Drink brother, these are them Crusaders
Who slide through the Mid East
To Hamburg, back to the border
Then some beef pop off, now it's war
A global terror in your area, U.S. calling they dogs
Bush with his regime against mujahideen
Suicide bombers vs the Marines
Al Qaeda would scheme
Nerve gas, anthrax thrown on the scene
Taliban coming martyrly
