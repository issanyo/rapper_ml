"12 years ago yeah...and all the fun"

[Scratching]
"Time for looking back" - Nas 'One Love'

[Verse One]
Little man facing the world, ice cream truck, soft cone, make it a swirl
BB gun kid chasing a squirrel, rather should've been chasing a girl
But you know it was "12 years ago"
Spitballs hitting my teacher
Little league, 1st base kid swing for the bleachers
Web hat, no fitted, velcro on my sneakers
Skipping school by faking my fevers, it was "12 years ago"
And I was just 12 years old
Stained up clothes, winter time stay with colds
Stuffy nose, summertime, spray the hose
Never thought that I'd be spitting these crazy flows
"12 years ago"
Alone on the Earth, throwing a Nerf
Raindrops soaking the turf
Getting booty back then? Nah dawg, got only to first
12 years right after my birth
It was "12 years ago"
And it was time to get bread
Little dude up in middle school with lines in my head
Butts up off the wall you was bound to get pegged
Trying to get ahead but I'm going back instead
"12 years ago"
When it was all so innocent
Had my first kiss, my first fight
Took my first hit of my first spliff but it ain't burn right
I used to roam the streets on a dirt bike
"12 years ago"
Blasting my music, Scram was a nuisance
Went from box juices to brew in my lap
40's and deuces, young buck losing his gap
Sometimes I wish that I could take it all back
"12 years ago"
Just to get a home cooked meal
Didn't need a deal, tackle football, meet at the field
When the Jets had Freeman McNeil, keeping it real
Now a days it's all seeming surreal
It was "12 years ago"

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
I saw the Twin Towers on a school trip
Never thought it's turn to nothing but a news clip
When I played stickball with a broomstick
Loose script gotta take a cool trip
"12 years ago"
And pull a page out from yesterday
Didn't need an Escalade
At my mom's rest I stay
Now I got this bullshit Rent-A-Pay
Still immature so let's just say that it's
"12 years ago"
And I'm eating Capt'n Crunch
Hawaiian Punch, Crunch & Munch, bags of lunch
Reebok Pumps, Dominqiue tomahawk dunks
Legend Of Zelda? At it for months
It was "12 years ago"
And I was trying to beat the last board
Sitting in a class bored, staring at the black board
Black top, still trying to touch the backboard
Now I gotta fast forward to camcord
"12 years ago"
So we can go back to the future
When I used to go to school on the back of a scooter
Back when none of my classes even had a computer
Mr. Belvedere was down with Bob Uecker
It was "12 years ago"
And I was going through growing pains
Getting in trouble with no one to blame
Wishing I was older
Huh, it's funny how things change
Finally grew up but still I feel the same as
"12 years ago"
Time flies and lightning's fast
12 years from right now will probably come in a flash
That's why every moment breathing you gotta make last
Dedicated to those that passed
Who were living "12 years ago"
