[Verse 1]
Alarm went off I gotta bounce in an hour
Got out of bed and I jumped in the shower
I brush my teeth starting ironing my shirt
Threw on my new suit now it's time to work
No time for breakfast, (You're not eating again?)
Sorry love I got a meeting at 10
Kiss my wife, good bye my kids and hug them
Told them I'll be back and daddy loved them
Pain in my heart as I drove off slow
I didn't know why but I had to go
Jump to west side and I start to speed in
Even though deep inside though I shouldn't be leaving
Didn't know why then didn't know the reason
Probably cause I wished I was still home sleeping
Now I'm thick in this traffic all I hear is beeping
I still got some work to do before my meeting
Found a garage get my car with the keys in
Told them I'll be back early in the evening
Cross the street look down at the time
This one I got a chill going down the spine
Whatever was should it had to wait
It was only 8:30 but it still was late
The work that I had to do take me more than an hour
Still haven't even gotten to the North Tower
Got to the lobby the elevator door
Had to travel all the way up to the 98 floor
On the elevator ride talking to my man Russ
Said after the meeting we should go and get lunch
I said no doubt than I felt real dizzy
I just shake it off I was too busy
Sat in the office the clock was ticking
8:37 now soon the plot would thicken
Open up my suitcase looking file by file
I had to finish up some work knowing it would take a while
Going through my notes and I started losing focus
The picture on my desk was all that I could notice
Family trip that's when my head started spacing
Wondering when will I get my next vacation

[Verse 2]
The whole building shook, thought it must be a bomb
I ran out the office is to see what was wrong
Everybody start to panic the smoke is getting strong
Couldn't gone downstairs the crowd was running up
Telling me to move 'cause the flames coming up
The smoke was getting thicker and I really couldn't see
Everything was getting darker I was left with just me
I ran in my office I picked up the phone
Punched in my home number couldn't get a dial tone
I could see the smoke I could taste the gas
Couldn't keep the window closed had to break the glass
Started gasping out I was passing out
That's when I saw all people straight hanging out
Thinking of myself this all had to be fake
So I closed my eyes hoping soon id be awake (please God!)
But when I opened them I was in the same place
Now I'm stuck by myself staring death in the face
Feel it in my heart it was almost over
Heat coming from the door sure the flames were closer
I crawled through the smoke and I found my picture
Held it in my arms when I heard whisper
(I love you!) That's what I blacked out
All the smoke I inhaled finally made me pass out
When I woke up I could a sworn I was floating
Thought it was a dream but my eyes was still open
Couldn't' see much everything was looking bright
Didn't feel any pain I was moving to the light
Just when I thought that my life was gone
I was in the hospital but I knew mom's arms
