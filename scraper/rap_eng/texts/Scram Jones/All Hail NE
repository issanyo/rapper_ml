All hail NE
All hail NE
All hail NE

[Verse 1: Swigga (AKA L-Swift), Anthony Cruz (AKA A-Butta), and Agu Obiakor (AKA Mr. Voodoo)]
[Swigga (AKA L-Swift)]
Uh, as I
Look up in the sky, see the Elements symbol, I’ll run
Fast ‘cause the fans are terribly fickle.  This that
Fork-in-the-road flow, but we met in the middle.  That’s why
Stones control drones and American missiles
[Anthony Cruz (AKA A-Butta)]
I got
A pump, rock steez, have sex with a pistol
And I’ll piss on a bitch if head is an issue.  I have
Several issues—you are now listening to a maniac
Trippy as Juicy J.  Voo, what you say to that?
[Agu Obiakor (AKA Mr. Voodoo)]
I’ma play
The back [?]
Turn beyond dawn, in sync with the Sun and Moon.  My gun
Entombs like New York streets give manholes, turn it
Instantly black like the last ep’ of The Sopranos
[Swigga (AKA L-Swift)]
[?] Anna Nicole anecdote
[Anthony Cruz (AKA A-Butta)]
Fight a Natural Element quote?  Might stab ‘em in the throat
[Agu Obiakor (AKA Mr. Voodoo)]
And on that note, for all emcees, it’s
The dead man’s quote to all hail NE

[Hook: All with Scratches by Scram Jones]
All hail NE
All hail NE
All hail NE
All hail NE

[Verse 2: Anthony Cruz (AKA A-Butta), Agu Obiakor (AKA Mr. Voodoo), and Swigga (AKA L-Swift)]
[Anthony Cruz (AKA A-Butta)]
They want us
Buried underground—no worries.  We virtually gave ‘em
A decade lost.  Now we’re back and scurrying around
Uvulas, YouTubers, I know you heard the sound
How it finished when thirteen year-olds are worshipping us now?
[Agu Obiakor (AKA Mr. Voodoo)]
Like evils in exile worshipping a cow
Flows established like Commandments on Moses tablets
We like it.  The gods writing rhymes are strikes of lightnings.  On
The mic, it’s frightening.  It’s the wrath of the titans
[Swigga (AKA L-Swift)]
I got
My NRA license—my 2nd Amendment testing men
Reverend-slash-scientist, blessing with different Elements
My president is black, my penis is on a pedestal
Bitches love my pickle—I hit ‘em with different vegetables
[Anthony Cruz (AKA A-Butta)]
Leave a Gemini Aquarius.  My Natural Element
Triple-headed king [?] or label me “His Eminence”
[Agu Obiakor (AKA Mr. Voodoo)]
The nemesis?  We castrate like feminists.  Inhalants
[?], impaling emcees.  All hail NE

[Hook: All with Scratches by Scram Jones]
All hail NE
All hail NE
All hail NE
All hail NE

[Verse 3: Anthony Cruz (AKA A-Butta), Agu Obiakor (AKA Mr. Voodoo), and Swigga (AKA L-Swift)]
[Anthony Cruz (AKA A-Butta)]
As we walk through
The fire and brimstone
[Agu Obiakor (AKA Mr. Voodoo)]
They wired for info
[Swigga (AKA L-Swift)]
I light up Swiggarillo
[Agu Obiakor (AKA Mr. Voodoo)]
They like when we switch flows
[Swigga (AKA L-Swift)]
Triple entendre, Oliver North Contra
[Agu Obiakor (AKA Mr. Voodoo)]
Flows criminal mantra, and each hit the drums like
Rastas blowing their ganja
[Anthony Cruz (AKA A-Butta)]
Demonic as [?]
Bohemian Grove got a cult following, a secret
They keep on the low
[Swigga (AKA L-Swift)]
But they all confess to us.  I feel like a
Priest in a robe—dímelo
[Agu Obiakor (AKA Mr. Voodoo)]
No need—they know
‘Cause they hail us as patrons.  They be jealous as Satan
Overzealous as pagans.  Amen
[Anthony Cruz (AKA A-Butta)]
Say it again
[Agu Obiakor (AKA Mr. Voodoo)]
Amen
[Anthony Cruz (AKA A-Butta)]
It’s ritualistic
[Swigga (AKA L-Swift)]
From an infinite distance
[Agu Obiakor (AKA Mr. Voodoo)]
Envision our spirits
All hail NE

[Hook: All with Scratches by Scram Jones]
All hail NE
All hail NE
All hail NE
All hail NE
