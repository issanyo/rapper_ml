[Verse]:
You little monkey hat nigga you better have some respect
Or you gon' wake up hung over lookin' at death
I'm Rocky in this bitch, the last fights the best
Rappers don't battle no mo' they just Youtube to death
I wasn't ever homophobic till recently
Got me yellin' "pause: when you say that you feelin' me
Uhh
I want my money back, here's my stub
Y'all confuse the internet buzz for love
I'm suppose to be high, music was my drug
But it got cut so many times it ain't worth a dub
Now I gotta get high on my own supply
Scram cook up the track, let's touch the sky
"Up up to the sky"
Souls is empty [Censor] told me that everybody's against me
I said, "What about you?" he just smirked
I guess why on El Che' we still ain't work
Family and friends, we had good relations
Till it turned to Bill Murray, Lost In Translation
That's why I don't subscribe to the gossip column
They misquote you, cut throat you and that's a problem
And y'all wanna get close to my big brother
Tryin' to get a Brand New look for the summer
What you gon' do when he change his number?
And you gotta call me up like, "It's off. You got another?"
