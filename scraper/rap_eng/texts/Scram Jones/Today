[Hook]
Today
The words don't mean enough for us to say
For us to say
Today
To steal the moment that we gave away
We gave away
Today

[Verse]
Homeless man on the train asking for some money
He was looking grungy, said that he was hungry hadn't eaten (today)
Said he fought for all our rights and served our country
Came back home, his life got ugly caused nobody seemed to care (today)
It's like the honor and respect is now irrelevant
You could have neither, still become the president, it's evident (today)
We don't gotta follow, we can represent
No one promised tomorrow, can't be hesitant just do it (today)
Cause the future's unknown
We miss what's right in front of us cause we all glued to our phone (today)
Weed is legal, you could get stoned
Don't need a deal, you could get known off of YouTube alone (today)
They could make your food with a clone
They could shoot up your home, using a drone, this is known (today)
I put my views in my poem
Before the funeral home, I thank God for waking up

Today
The words don't mean enough for us to say
For us to say
Today
To steal the moment that we gave away
We gave away
Today

[Verse]
The Army and the Navy still trying to recruit troops
Everything is Bluetooth, rappers selling fruit juice (today)
Can't trust all these news groups, can't trust all the blue suits
The cops that got their screws loose, they'll kill ya (today)
Everything recorded, make it look important
Make it look distorted, how they caught it, yeah that's how they on it (today)
Still somebody's dad just got deported
A child just got aborted cause their ma couldn't afford it (today)
Somebody fighting for their life
Somebody sitting in a dark cell wishing someone write (today)
Kids don't gotta write, they type
They judge life on likes, and like to mumble on mics (today)
Technology is changing our psychology plus our economy
Still somebody just won the lottery (today)
More people changing their philosophy
Living more consciously, you wanna make a change it gotta be

Today
The words don't mean enough for us to say
For us to say
Today
To steal the moment that we gave away
We gave away
Gave it away

What does it all mean?
And when crisis hits, we don't turn against each other
No, we listen to each other
We lean on each other
Because we are always stronger together
