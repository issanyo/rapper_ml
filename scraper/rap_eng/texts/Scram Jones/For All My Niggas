[Intro: Styles P]
Scram! Ayy

[Verse 1: Styles P & Dave East]
Tony Soprano juice, hit 'em, played the block and shot up the canvas too
Reppin’ for my niggas gone, that's what Phantoms do
Get you dead at 25, yeah, that's what cannons do
All my niggas animals, got them hood-rats in them cheetah prints
I ain’t even fuckin' her, she just get that heater in
Thinkin' 'bout the Aston Martin, I can play Anita in
Couple niggas doin' life, I ain't gon' see again
Couple niggas owe money, somebody gotta bleed again
Styles don't even write his shit, I pray that I don’t see the pen (I pray)
Sellin’ crack out the same crib that we was sleepin' in (Same crib)
Dead broke, robbed the DJ ’fore he get the speakers in (C'mere)
Chain like Dasani, my pistol match the Armani
Tryna stay cool like Ghandi, my schemes be ponzi
Same nigga had Christina Milian in Haji's
Cook you niggas over a grill, this shit Hibachi

[Chorus: Styles P & Dave East]
For all of the homies that been locked up (Locked up)
For all of the work that been chopped up (Chopped up)
Cop you designer and stay shopped up (Shopped up)
Luxury V, stay dropped up (Dropped up)
For all of the homies that been locked up (Locked up)
For all of the work that been chopped up (Chopped up)
Cop you designer and stay shopped up (Shopped up)
Luxury V, we stay dropped up (Dropped up)

[Verse 2: Styles P & Dave East]
Couple homies goin' to jail
Me and East at Philippe’s if we say we going to chow
I let the shit ring, my nigga throw in the towel
Throw weed in the pipe before I'm goin' to town
I'm not wise enough, have never known an L
But I'm smart enough to stay low, always go on the prowl
This some grimy shit, I'm never going to trial
Shoot it out with the law, you know I'm goin' in Style
You've been broke for a minute, ain't got no dough in a while
No soda but I seen fiends leave with coke and a smile
Philippe's closed, fuck it, I make 'em open up TAO
In love with the 'Rari but honestly the Rover my style (Range)
Violatin', think it's funny, watch how I go end your smile
Lost a lot of homies so my momma just hope that I smile
Purple tops, get familiar, I seen that coke in a vial
If I was holdin' before, you know I'm holdin' it now

[Chorus: Styles P & Dave East]
For all of the homies that been locked up (Locked up)
For all of the work that been chopped up (Chopped up)
Cop you designer and stay shopped up (Shopped up)
Luxury V, stay dropped up (Dropped up)
For all of the homies that been locked up (Locked up)
For all of the work that been chopped up (Chopped up)
Cop you designer and stay shopped up (Shopped up)
Luxury V, we stay dropped up (Dropped up)

[Verse 3: Dave East & Styles P]
If you don't like me, you don't like me, it's more than enough shots for ya
Smack a nigga, he gon' post it or call the cops on you
You don't know paranoid 'til somebody got the drop on ya
Case don't get dismissed, I know some niggas that shot lawyers
And the DA too, come to the credit, ask the plug, I was preapproved
Real niggas see the mood
Got the strap, say you gon' clap, gotta see it through
Live by my word, that's my word, how G are you?

[Chorus: Styles P & Dave East]
For all of the homies that been locked up (Locked up)
For all of the work that been chopped up (Chopped up)
Cop you designer and stay shopped up (Shopped up)
Luxury V, stay dropped up (Dropped up)
For all of the homies that been locked up (Locked up)
For all of the work that been chopped up (Chopped up)
Cop you designer and stay shopped up (Shopped up)
Luxury V, we stay dropped up (Dropped up)
