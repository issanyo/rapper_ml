[Chorus]
I don't want to open my eyes
Sometimes it's like I'm living a dream
Roll it up let's all get high
Sometimes that's all that you need
Baby I don't have the time
But show me love while I'm on the grind
I got a lot of shit on my mind
So I don't want to hear it

[Verse 1]
The bullshit, I just can't go near it
All the hating ain't good for your spirit
But we still sipping spirits you shouldn't judge from appearance
Whoaa, Ive been going so hard
I really need a milli for the squad
I pray to God we make it through when times are hard
Baby we can go up
We can go all the way up

[Chorus]
I don't want to open my eyes
Sometimes it's like I'm living a dream
Roll it up let's all get high
Sometimes that's all that you need
Baby I don't have the time
But show me love while I'm on the grind
I got a lot of shit on my mind
So I don't want to hear it

[Verse 2]
All the late nights, that I came home
Work sucks, I know
That's why I'm on the road
Shooting all these videos
Getting everything I'm owed
Need a million just to throw
Who would of known?
I'm trying to travel the globe
Shorty took me home
Put me in the blindfold

[Chorus]
I don't want to open my eyes
Sometimes it's like I'm living a dream
Roll it up let's all get high
Sometimes that's all that you need
Baby I don't have the time
But show me love while I'm on the grind
I got a lot of shit on my mind
So I don't want to hear it
