A time for us, some day there'll be a new world
A world of shining hope for you and me

[Chorus]
*scratching* I'm back!
*scratching* Did you forget about me?
(x4)

[Verse 1]
What's happening, I'm back off the wagon, smashing this rapping thing
Rappers think they're dapper, it's sad, the badness they're babbling
Chatting about packing Gatlings and battling, I'll batter them
My adjectives are like daggers and javelins that stab your skin
Not challenging, maggots are blagging, fraggles are haggling
Back with a classic to snatch your status off these Plasticine
I've dabbled in, madness, how I've handled it is baffling
I'm trapped in sin and damaged within, but still I have to win
Aiming to break the pavements and take it straight to the majors
Make all of my favourites famous, I pray that today it changes
I patiently pave the way for a day that we make the papers
The haters are staying haters, they're fakers, they're blatant traitors
Thought satan's chasing my status, I'll break away from the matrix
They laid us to waste of phrases and slaving for slave-made trainers
And blaze us, complacent Pagans who strained to escape the Masons
Who gave us the AIDS and plagues and not blaming my brainless patrons

[Chorus]
*scratching* I'm back!
*scratching* Did you forget about me?
(x4)

[Verse 2]
Put on my Air Max, and walk around a day in my shoes
Look at the bare facts, and talk about paying my dues
You realise every bar that I'm saying is true
Phone in to cuss, any DJ that ain't playing my tunes
In a drought, consider me the Guinness Stout
No I'm not the biggest or baddest, I'm just the illest out
His bars might sound good when he spits them out
But would it mean something if you were looking at it, written down?
I can't front, like the way I'm living is perfect
Can't look at the cards you got, saying you didn't deserve it
Selling poison to people, that isn't my purpose
Knowledge of self, that's the flipping gift that I'm cursed with
People's Army, all my guys organise properly
Feds wanna commit, borderline sodomy
Bring coppers in choppers, you all can try stopping me
Every tune's a chapter in my autobiography

[Chorus]
*scratching* I'm back!
*scratching* Did you forget about me?
(x4)
