Lyrics from snippet

[Intro]
Blueface, baby
Got it from Mike Crook
Mmm-mmm
Yeah, aight
I'm in this bitch with that gang

[Chorus]
I'm in this bitch with that gang
Big MAC, fatter than Curtis Payne
No D'wayan, but I bring Major Payne
Benz truck, take up both of the lanes
I'm in this bitch with that gang
Big MAC, fatter than Curtis Payne
No D'wayan, but I bring Major Payne
Benz truck, take up both of the lanes

[Verse 1]
Benz truck, I'm in both of the lanes (Both of the lanes)
Kilograms on my tray (On my tray)
Empty the clip so I don't even gotta aim (Don't gotta aim)
30 shots in this bitch, like I'm gang
30 Crips in the club, they're gang (They're mob)
I'm from the mob
How could I slip if I stay with a mop?
Bring the beef to your house like delivery
I was off-beat so I changed my delivery (Delivery)
I used to sell cocaine, whiter than Hillary (Whiter than Hillary)
I need a bitch to listen my chillin'

[Chorus]
I'm in this bitch with that gang
Big MAC, fatter than Curtis Payne
No D'wayan, but I bring Major Payne
Benz truck, take up both of the lanes
I'm in this bitch with that gang
Big MAC, fatter than Curtis Payne
No D'wayan, but I bring Major Payne
Benz truck, take up both of the lanes

[Verse 2]
I'm in this bitch with the gang
No D'wayan, this Glock do major pain
Big MAC on me, go brrang-dang-bang-bang
(MAC on me, go brrang-dang-bang-bang)
All these chains hurt my neck like a slave
Keep a cannon on me, like I am knave
Hit your block and light that bitch up like a Bic
She be a freak, 'cause she grinding on two dicks (Two dicks)
Pull up in a coupe, no photo, no pic (No pic)
I'm an asshole, I'm a shithead

[Chorus]
I'm in this bitch with that gang
Big MAC, fatter than Curtis Payne
No D'wayan, but I bring Major Payne
Benz truck, take up both of the lanes
I'm in this bitch with that gang
Big MAC, fatter than Curtis Payne
No D'wayan, but I bring Major Payne
Benz truck, take up both of the lanes
