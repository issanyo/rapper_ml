[Chorus: Shawn Eff]
Lil Bitch
I just hit my step
Quad step then I slide to the left

Everybody on one
Hit a nigga and his bitch, and one
I just hit my step (my step)

Quad step then I slide to the left
I just hit my step
I just hit my step
I just hit my step

[Verse 1: Mike Sherm]
Today i'm stepping out
Y'all want no cheese, all you niggas chasing clout
Put your money where your mouth at
Got a couple hunnid thou' in my three bank accounts
Bitch
Let me take it on one
Been a boy out, looked up to no one
She ain't got no ass, she goin' have to blow some
Then I cut her off quick like the bitch throw some
Hit my step when she seen that check
She go stupid when she give that neck
What I made today, could've went and bought a Lex
Couple niggas dozing, the circle got X'd
Slide to the left
Your bitch in my DM
Fucked his head up when I fucked on his BM
Slide to the left
Your bitch in my DM
Fucked his head up when I fucked on his BM
