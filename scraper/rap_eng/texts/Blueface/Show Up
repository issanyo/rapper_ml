[Chorus: Blueface]
It ain't goin' 'til I go up ('Til I go up)
It ain't no show until I show up ('Til I show up)
Can't hit my pour until I'm poured up (Poured up)
Goofy nigga, ain't no smoke until I'm smoked up (Ain't no smoke 'til I'm smoked up)
It ain't goin' 'til I go up ('Til I go up)
It ain't no show until I show up ('Til I show up)

Goofy nigga, ain't no smoke until I'm smoked up (Ain't no smoke 'til I'm smoked up)

[Verse 1: Blueface]
Damn, I just fucked the hook off (I just fucked 'em)
I gotta say it again, it ain't goin' until I go up ('Til I go up)
It ain't no show until I show up ('Til I show up)
Bitch, I'm that nigga on the scene (Yeah aight)
Blueface, baby, yeah aight
The flyest you ever seen (Flyest you ever seen)
Bitch, I put gold faces in my earrings (Bop)
I'm really him, put gold in my mouth just to match the fuckin' bling (Bling)
I got pornstar dick (Yeah aight), bet you feel it in your spleen (Your spleen)
I don't mean to be mean, don't chase me, bitch (Chase a bag)
Chase your motherfuckin' dream
I spit all gasoline (Gasoline)
You niggas poppin' 87, dummy (87)
This Benz only take supreme (Stupid)
Stop playin', I eat pussy with my grill in (Yeah aight)
What the fuck a nigga mean? (Yeah aight)
Yeah aight, yeah aight, yeah aight, look

[Chorus: Blueface]
It ain't goin' 'til I go up ('Til I go up)
It ain't no show until I show up ('Til I show up)
Can't hit my pour until I'm poured up (Poured up)
Goofy nigga, ain't no smoke until I'm smoked up (Ain't no smoke 'til I'm smoked up)
It ain't goin' 'til I go up ('Til I go up)
It ain't no show until I show up ('Til I show up)
Can't hit my pour until I'm poured up (Poured up)
Goofy nigga, ain't no smoke until I'm smoked up (Ain't no smoke 'til I'm smoked up)

[Verse 2: Joey Franko]
I don't care if your man here, baby, fuck him (Fuck him)
This the VIP section, we throwin' money in here (On God)
Ten freaks tryna get geeked, I came with Big Gleesh (Ugh)
DG, I am from Harlem like I am Dave East (Ooh)
Dumbass, this tool regular (Regular)
Ratchet in person, on the 'Gram you actin' like you better (You a thot)
Young Joey Frank, act an ass, he don't know better (Joey Frank)
Cheddar in the freezer just so I can keep my cheese fresher (Ooh)
Got dick, for the not-bring-it-to-the-table bitches (Yeah)
Free loadin', that's a no-go, that's for them lame niggas
M. Jackson, gold just like these gloves so you know I'm glistenin' (Shinin')
Chain gold on my neck, lookin' like it's pissin' (Like piss)
She say, "Why the attitude?" I'm an asshole (Asshole)
Your nigga party was borin' before I took over (This nigga wack)
Look, and I ain't come by myself, bitch (What?)
I came with Dirt Mob, bitch
I'm good for your health, they be playin' (Dirt Mob)

[Chorus: Blueface]
It ain't goin' 'til I go up ('Til I go up)
It ain't no show until I show up ('Til I show up)
Can't hit my pour until I'm poured up (Poured up)
Goofy nigga, ain't no smoke until I'm smoked up (Ain't no smoke 'til I'm smoked up)
(Onii made this shit)
It ain't goin' 'til I go up ('Til I go up)
It ain't no show until I show up ('Til I show up)
Can't hit my pour until I'm poured up (Poured up)
Goofy nigga, ain't no smoke until I'm smoked up (Ain't no smoke 'til I'm smoked up)
