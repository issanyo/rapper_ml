[Verse: Blueface]
Blueface baby, Yea Aight
Poppin' hot shit if you want me come and get me
Play with my respect and it get grimy
Anybody can get touched all it takes is perfect timing

I had to pull up with that rocket, nice in person but on the gram
He trynna' pop it, stop it
Before I pull up and really sock lips
No reply to a nigga that’s talkin’ non-sense
Can't pull up til’ you make that deposit (fuck a nigga mean?)
Make That deposit (ooh)

[Verse 2: Almighty Suspect]
Ridin' round town finna' trip with this blower
Rock in my sock trynna' serve me a smoker
I just seen the J's if I slip then it's over
Bitch I'm famous I need me a chauffeur, nigga!
Tell her put it in my pocket
Big blue strips and they tucked by my rocket
Bleedin' every scene they keep tellin' me to stop it
Niggas really hate me, tell em' come pop me, over!
Talk strips what I told her, bitch bring bands if she dont
Then it's over, nigga!
And Me and blueface fucked em'
Any nigga trip grab blower, imma bust em' !
