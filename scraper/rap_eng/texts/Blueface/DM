[Intro: Blueface]
Blueface, baby
Yeah, aight
I can crack any bitch with a DM
Bop

[Chorus: Blueface]
I can crack any bitch with a DM (With a DM)
Ain’t got a dime, let a bitch hold semen (Hold this)
Chimichanga for a nigga want some beefin' (Want some beefin')
Five bands, and that's just for the weekend (For the weekend)
I can crack any bitch with a DM (With a DM)
Ain’t got a dime, let a bitch hold semen (Hold this)
Chimichanga for a nigga want some beefin' (Want some beefin')
Five bands, and that's just for the weekend (For the weekend)

[Verse 1: Blueface]
Five bands, and that's just for the weekend (For the weekend)
Kansas City in my blunt when I'm chiefin' (Bitch, chiefin')
I don't go off the beat, bitch, I off it (Fuck them)
I'm a asshole, I get paid just to talk shit (Talk to 'em)
Blowing bands, regular day at the office (Ooh)
30 in my 40, bet it make a nigga dance (Bop)
30 my 40, turn a hater to a fan (Bleed it)
Couple bands, two dicks in my hands (Two dicks)
40 Glock, nose long as a burrito
Start every song like I'm finna sing with the Beatles (Blueface, baby)
I'm what the game has been missing
I can say the same thing and still sound different (Yeah, aight)
You been rapping, I just do this for the weekend (For the weekend)
You still tryna crack a bitch in my DMs (In my DMs)
I do 5 bands just for the weekend
That was just for the weekend!

[Chorus: Blueface]
I can crack any bitch with a DM (With a DM)
Ain’t got a dime, let a bitch hold semen (Hold this)
Chimichanga for a nigga want some beefin' (Want some beefin')
Five bands, and that's just for the weekend (For the weekend)
I can crack any bitch with a DM (With a DM)
Ain’t got a dime, let a bitch hold semen (Hold this)
Chimichanga for a nigga want some beefin' (Want some beefin')
Five bands, and that's just for the weekend (For the weekend)

[Verse 2: YBN Almighty Jay]
Got your Instagram crush in my DM (In my DM)
J-John Cena, dumb bitch, you can't see him, ooh (Bitch!)
Blue face, hundreds in my pocket, ooh (Pocket)
Blueface, baby, with the rocket, ooh (With the rocket)
I'm shopping with the plug, fuck the socket (Fuck a socket)
I'm rich as fuck, I don't need college, ooh (Need college)
Tucked it in L.A. with some real killers (Yeah)
All I really hang around is real niggas (Yeah)
I can crack any bitch with a DM (With a DM)
Beam reflect off his head like it's 3M (Pew pew)
My brother still sit by the same stove (Same stove)
You wake up every morning to the same hoe (To the same hoe)
Gave that bitch whiplash, like the Jango (Skrt, skrt)
Blueface pull up, flexin' with a bank roll (Blaow!)
I'm in Venice beach with all my chains on
Made it rain in the club, that's a rain storm, ooh (Gang!)

[Chorus: Blueface]
I can crack any bitch with a DM (With a DM)
Ain’t got a dime, let a bitch hold semen (Hold this)
Chimichanga for a nigga want some beefin' (Want some beefin')
Five bands, and that's just for the weekend (For the weekend)
I can crack any bitch with a DM (With a DM)
Ain’t got a dime, let a bitch hold semen (Hold this)
Chimichanga for a nigga want some beefin' (Want some beefin')
Five bands, and that's just for the weekend (For the weekend)
