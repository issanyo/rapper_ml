[Intro]
FBeat producin' all the heat

[Verse 1: JamesTooCold]
Ayy, we really trippin'
Pull up on his block and I hope we missin' the children
I just fuck 'em and duck 'em, on my granny, don't deal with feelings
Better stick to the squabble 'cause you niggas ain't with no killing
Stop cappin', nigga
We was punkin', packin', and jackin' niggas
Move with all that yappin', full metal jackets for actin' niggas
Forties in my dashes, I catch 'em lackin', I blast a nigga
Tryna ride this wave, on gang, I'm quick to splash a nigga
Big poles, ayy, and we got big MAC's
Knick-knacks, that fake ass front you, come get your shit back
Good cooks, nigga, she on that riff-raff
Gang in here like a kickback and we all click clack like quick math, ayy
It's .40 plus a thirty, lil' birdie, heard you be singin' so I won't show no mercy
Do him dirty, hoes then spotty, we turned him to a jersey
I ain't worried, niggas be really jokes like Charlie Murphy
Rick James, bitch, better have the TooCold
I go crazy, bitch, I'm tryna dodge the group homes
He a snitch, he not the homie, I know you told
On my mom, on my pops, I'll never fold, never blow
Boy you sober, you don't want no smoke, niggas broke
Pop out, you niggas gettin' poked, niggas slow
I be trickin' and finessin' hoes, gettin' dough
Fuck your bitch but we ain't cuffin' those, nigga

[Chorus: JamesTooCold]
Slide back down that block, leave no witness (Leave no witness)
Fuck with keys but this Glock got extensions (Got extensions)
Bite an apple, yeah I mack on his bitches (On these bitches)
Big blowers, I ain't ridin' with no snitch, nigga (Ain't no snitch, nigga)
Slide back down that block, leave no witness (Leave no witness)
Fuck with keys but this Glock got extensions (Got extensions)
Bite an apple, yeah I mack on his bitches
Big blowers, I ain't ridin' with no snitch, nigga, bitch nigga

[Verse 2: Blueface]
Blueface, baby, yeah aight
Reach for this chain, bet this Glock change his mind (On the set)
Big apple mackin', with the action (Big mackin')
Pistol packin', get hit with a stick like I'm playin' Madden
Knock the waves off his cap, I ain't doin' no cappin' (No cappin')
Too paid, big forty knock off a nigga toupée (off a toupée)
Glock with a dick for niggas thinkin' they big bold (Oh, yeah aight)
James in the cut, bounce out with the TooCold (With the TooCold)
Big Glock, get to barkin' like a blue nose (Boom boom boom)
I'm not a stripper but I always gotta keep a pole (Big poles)
Give a bitch a jacket just to do her too cold (So cold)
They gave me twenty-five hundred just to get up close (Bop)
Cutthroat, your pockets empty, we can't kick it if your legs broke (Bleed 'em)
Keep the pussy, baby, I just want the throat (Ooh), yeah
Keep the pussy, baby, I just want the throat

[Outro: Blueface]
What he say?
Your pockets empty, how we gon' kick it if your legs broke?
On the dead locs (Bop, yeah aight)
FBeat producin' all the heat
