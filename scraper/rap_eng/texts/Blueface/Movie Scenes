[Intro]
Too Raw
Blueface, baby
Yeah, aight
Ooh, clip full of movie scenes, ooh
It's a clip full of movie scenes

[Chorus]
Ooh, it’s a clip full of movie scenes
Used to dream of living, I had to wake up and live the dream
Drop that opening act, bitch, I'm a headliner
Let a nigga trip, push his shit back like a head-liner
Ooh, it's a clip full of movie scenes
Used to dream of living, I had to wake up and live the dream
Drop that opening act, bitch, I’m a headliner
Let a nigga trip, push his shit back like a head-liner, ooh

[Verse]
Damn, I bounce out the flyest
Pieced up, bop bop, bitch, I'm really fuckin' 'em
I beat the pussy like it stole somethin' (I just fucked 'em)
I need a Victoria's Secret that like to fuck and not say nothin' (Shh)
My name hold weight, baby (Blueface, baby)
I just wanna eat better tonight (EBT)
Pussy always better when the bitch on Section 8 (Section 8)
Eat the pussy like some Frosted Flakes (Stretch marks)
I love a tiger body, the pussy be great (Great)
Fuck the beat, I really had to gas up (Gas up)
Clip full of movie scenes, shoot his ass up (Shoot his ass up)
Ooh, damn, it’s really goin’ up, showin' up
Blowin’ weed at Chevron, bitch, I'm really blowin' up
Damn, bitch, I been a savage before 21 (Bop)
I been the man, bitch, you just gettin' hip (Bleed ’em)
Stop playin' with me bitch, yeah aight
I been had Benzes before this shit was cool to get, bop

[Chorus]
Ooh, it's a clip full of movie scenes
Used to dream of living, I had to wake up and live the dream
Drop that opening act, bitch, I'm a headliner
Let a nigga trip, push his shit back like a head-liner
Ooh, it's a clip full of movie scenes
Used to dream of living, I had to wake up and live the dream
Drop that opening act, bitch, I'm a headliner
Let a nigga trip, push his shit back like a head-liner, ooh
