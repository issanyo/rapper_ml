[Intro]
Blueface baby (Mop)
This is an Ace production
Yeah, aight (Bleed 'em)
Mr. "Only Call a Bitch When I Need Her," yeah

[Chorus]
Fuck a boyfriend, lil’ baby, choose a player (Blueface, baby)
Got her lost in the sauce, kickin' flavor (Too much flavor)
Mr. "Only Call a Bitch When I Need Her" (Over)
Grammies on my neck, froze like a freezer (Eugh)
Fuck a boyfriend, lil' baby, choose a player (Blueface, baby)
Got her lost in the sauce, kickin’ flavor (Too much flavor)
Mr. "Only Call a Bitch When I Need Her" (Over)
Grammies on my neck, froze like a freezer (Eugh)

[Verse]
Mr. "Only Call a Bitch When I Need Her" (Blueface, baby)
Fuck a boyfriend, lil' baby, choose a player (I'm a player)
Got her lost in the sauce, kickin' flavor (All this sauce)
Once this mack can get her, can't nobody save her (You can't save her)
I ain't talking app, but lil' baby, let’s Facetime (I need Facetime)
Only when it’s face, you can keep your damn time (Keep that damn time)
Call her when I'm horny like the bitch a hotline (Hotline)
All I got for you is hard dick and hot lines (Hot lines)
Call me mistress, send the bitch straight to voice mail (Straight to voicemail)
Time is money, so you better make it worth it (Over)
Money, money, all I want is the cheese (Ooh)
Pulled up so cold, I gave the bitch the chillys (Eugh)
I’m just too player, lil' baby, hate the game (Hate the game)
Keep that love and affection, give me brain (Brrang-dang-dang)
Boyfriend always hating on a nigga mackin'
I let this MAC go brrang-dang-dang-dang (Brrang-dang-dang-dang)
Help a nigga fall back like November (Like November)
I need a lil' baby that’s ugly with the shits (Whatever)
Dick the bitch open like she a condiment (Nasty)
Get what I want out the bitch then I dip (Then I dip)

[Chorus]
Fuck a boyfriend, lil' baby, choose a player (Blueface, baby)
Got her lost in the sauce, kickin' flavor (Too much flavor)
Mr. "Only Call a Bitch When I Need Her" (Over)
Grammies on my neck, froze like a freezer (Eugh)
Fuck a boyfriend, lil' baby, choose a player (Blueface, baby)
Got her lost in the sauce, kickin' flavor (Too much flavor)
Mr. "Only Call a Bitch When I Need Her" (Over)
Grammies on my neck, froze like a freezer (Eugh)
