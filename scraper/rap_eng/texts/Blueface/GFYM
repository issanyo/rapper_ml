[Intro: Trendd]
Bitches off the Instagram, I'm tryna get near you
But bitch, your service weak as fuck, I can't even hear you
Hello? Can't even hear you
Hello?
Get it from your mom
Get it from your mom

[Chorus: Trendd & Blueface]
Chuckin' up the deuces 'cause bitch, I'm the one
Rap game changed, niggas toss like a drug
Tryna get my nut then poof, bitch, I'm gone
You's a little cute bitch, you must get it from your mom
Get it from your mom (She must've got it from her mama)
Shake that ass, lil' baby, yeah aight
Get it from your mom
Shake that ass, lil' baby, baby, baby

[Verse 1: Trendd]
The set's too active so I brought my gun
Y'all claim blood or cuz but that's my blood cousin
Bitch, why you playin' like you don't want this lovin'?
Big Trendd, baby, hot like an oven
Bitch, where your mama?
If you can't take the dick, what that mean?
That you ain't been- fuck it, I'm too close to cummin'
Lil' bitch throw it back, fat ass like we stunt the way she stuntin'
Backflip, bitch hit the splits and then land on that dick
I'm tryna see some ballerina shit
And I see two lil' babies in the back right there
Look like they on some Venus and Serena shit
Backflip, bitch hit the splits and then land on that dick
I'm tryna see some ballerina shit
And I see two lil' babies in the back right there
Look like they on some Venus and Serena shit, I'm tryna hit

[Chorus: Trendd & Blueface]
Chuckin' up the deuces 'cause bitch, I'm the one
Rap game changed, niggas toss like a drug
Tryna get my nut then poof, bitch, I'm gone
You's a little cute bitch, you must get it from your mom
Get it from your mom (She must've got it from her mama)
Shake that ass, lil' baby, yeah aight
Get it from your mom
Shake that ass, lil' baby, baby, baby

[Verse 2: Blueface]
Blueface, baby (Yeah aight), yeah aight
Shake that ass, shake that ass (Pop it)
Toot that shit up
I bang the set whenever I'm bangin' a bitch
So you know I had to throw it up
She must've got it from her mama 'cause she goin' up
Touchin' her toes like some laundry, I gotta fold it up, throw it up
Bitch give me neck 'til she throwin' up
She got the message, I ain't even call her back
Tell these young bitches talkin', bitch
Where your mama at? I give her good dick
Like I owed her that, blowin' her back
I could do a bitch cold and still get the bitch back
Flip that, switch that, miss that, now the bitch big mad
Give her that dope dick, yankin' her weave, givin' her whiplash
This bitch a fiend, pop up like a pill then she relapse
Yeah aight, I don't fuckin' know, let me hear that

[Chorus: Trendd & Blueface]
Chuckin' up the deuces 'cause bitch, I'm the one
Rap game changed, niggas toss like a drug
Tryna get my nut then poof, bitch, I'm gone
You's a little cute bitch, you must get it from your mom
Get it from your mom (She must've got it from her mama)
Shake that ass, lil' baby, yeah aight
Get it from your mom
Shake that ass, lil' baby, baby, baby
Chuckin' up the deuces 'cause bitch, I'm the one
Rap game changed, niggas toss like a drug
Tryna get my nut then poof, bitch, I'm gone
You's a little cute bitch, you must get it from your mom
Get it from your mom (She must've got it from her mama)
Yeah aight
Get it from your mom
Shake that ass, lil' baby, baby, baby

[Outro: Trendd]
Bitches off the Instagram, I'm tryna get near you
