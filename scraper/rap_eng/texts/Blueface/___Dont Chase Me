[Intro]
Blueface, baby
Yeah, aight
Bitch chase me, I'm a man
Don't chase me, baby, chase the henny
Up it, up it
Up it
Holiday

[Chorus]
What's the deal, lil' baby?
Change if I want, you can't change me
Chase the liquor, don't chase me
Never let a bitch break me
What's the deal, lil' baby?
Change if I want, you can't change me
Chase the liquor, don't chase me
Never let a bitch break me

[Verse 1]
Chase a bag, bitch don't chase me
Bitch I'm in the stu', bitch do you
'Cause I'ma do me, love don't take me
Do what I want, you can't make me
First it come love, then come crazy
Then I fall back, push mail and all that
Let's not play these games, it could be so simple
Just stay in your lane, and don't always complain
Let's roll up some weed, pour up some drank
Help numb the pain

[Chorus]
What's the deal, lil' baby?
Change if I want, you can't change me
Chase the liquor, don't chase me
Never let a bitch break me
What's the deal, lil' baby?
Change if I want, you can't change me
Chase the liquor, don't chase me
Never let a bitch break me

[Verse 2]
I'm bouncing out the Benz
Baby, bring some friends
Let's just go up, she wanna make love
I just wanna fuck, don't need to confuse it
You the one I'm lovin' she just the one I'm using
Have me no relations, 'cause I get tired of runnin'
And you get tired of chasin'

[Chorus]
What's the deal, lil' baby?
Change if I want, you can't change me
Chase the liquor, don't chase me
Never let a bitch break me
