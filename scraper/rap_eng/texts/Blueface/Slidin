Catch him slipin like he walkin on ice
My niggas don't play fair, we ain't nice
Catch his ass slipin we ain't tryin to fight
We wanna take a niggas life, ain't no cameras in sight
Niggas is pussy gotta be kidding (Gotta be kidding)
You talking licks you know I'm with it (You know I'm with it)
The nigga got killed don't know who did it (Know who did it)
The nigga got killed don't know who did it (Know who did it)
