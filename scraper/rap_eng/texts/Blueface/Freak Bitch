[Intro]
Blueface, baby
Yeah
(Aight), aight (Aight)
(Aight), aight
(I need a freak bitch)
I need a freak bitch
I need a freak bitch
I need a freak bitch

[Chorus]
I need a freak bitch that don't give a fuck (On the set)
Bangin' the set while I'm beatin' up her guts (On the set)
I like fuckin', I ain't into no lovin' (On the set)
It's two dicks in my pants for a nigga that's trippin' (On the set)
I need a freak bitch that don't give a fuck (On the set)
Bangin' the set while I'm beatin' up her guts (On the set)
I like fuckin', I ain't into no lovin' (On the set)
It's two dicks in my pants for a nigga that's trippin' (On the set)

[Verse]
It's two dicks in my pants for a bitch
And a nigga that want me to fuck off his life (Fuck him)
Bitch, I'm the flyest, I fuck niggas' wives (Bop)
I'm a five-star recruit with the dick (Bleed 'em)
It's always a nigga's BM comin' through like I'm workin' with WIC (Big dick, baby)
Just call me the baby mama blammer (Blammer)
BlueFace, baby, yeah aight, she pull up like some diapers (Bop)
Hate a bitch that talk too much, bitch, I ain't ask no questions (Bleed 'em)
So what's up with all these answers? (All these answers)
Gave it to her good, now she wanna hold me down like an anchor (Stupid)
Hit her with a pump fake
Turn around, pull off like I'm Kobe with the Lakers
If she don't wanna fuck, shit, I ain't gon' make her (Make her)
Bitch I'm too fly to be tryna convince a bitch (Yeah aight)
Baby I'm a blessing (I'm a blessing)
What the fuck I look like stressin'? (I ain't stressin')
Any bitch ain't let me fuck, I had to boss up
Just to teach that bitch a lesson
I get a bitch without workin' a muscle (Without workin' a muscle)
Why these niggas steady flexin'?

[Chorus]
I need a freak bitch that don't give a fuck (On the set)
Bangin' the set while I'm beatin' up her guts (On the set)
I like fuckin', I ain't into no lovin' (On the set)
It's two dicks in my pants for a nigga that's trippin' (On the set)
I need a freak bitch that don't give a fuck (On the set)
Bangin' the set while I'm beatin' up her guts (On the set)
I like fuckin', I ain't into no lovin' (On the set)
It's two dicks in my pants for a nigga that's trippin' (On the set)
