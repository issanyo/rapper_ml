[Intro: Trendd]
Trendd
You see me, baby
'Cause I'm poppin'

[Chorus: Trendd]
I told lil' baby give it up 'cause I'm poppin'
I'm tryna open up your door like a locksmith
Bust it open for a player, baby, drop it
Throw your hood up if you really poppin'
I told lil' baby give it up 'cause I'm poppin'
I'm tryna open up your door like a locksmith
Bust it open for a player, baby, drop it
Throw your hood up if you really mobbin'

[Verse 1: Trendd]
I'm all up in this bitch faded, what's the deal, son?
My phone ring, then it better be a meal run
I can't 'cause a young nigga tryna feel somethin'
And if a nigga cross the line I'm tryna kill somethin'
Everybody fuck with me, I'm a real one
Play your cards right, I might deal one
If the money on the table, I'ma fuck and run
I was robbin' niggas, now I'm on the fuckin' run
Got robbed before, before I had a fuckin' gun
Now I wish a nigga would, I'm a fuckin' don
Baby wanna turn around, yeah we turnin' up
Where these niggas at when I was still comin' up?

[Chorus: Trendd]
I told lil' baby give it up 'cause I'm poppin'
I'm tryna open up your door like a locksmith
Bust it open for a player, baby, drop it
Throw your hood up if you really poppin'
I told lil' baby give it up 'cause I'm poppin'
I'm tryna open up your door like a locksmith
Bust it open for a player, baby, drop it
Throw your hood up if you really mobbin'

[Outro: Trendd]
If you really mobbin'
'Cause a nigga poppin'
If you really mobbin'
