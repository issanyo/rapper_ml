[Intro]
Got it from Mike Crook

[Chorus]
Stop cappin' (Stop cappin'), I'm really popping (Popping)
How can I slip if I'm the one doing the mopping?
No forensics, no witness, no ballistics (No ballistics)
No attachments, but this Glock got extensions
Stop the cappin' (Stop the cappin'), I'm really popping (Popping)
How can I slip if I'm the one doing the mopping?
No forensics, no witness, no ballistics (No ballistics)
No attachments, but this Glock got extensions

[Verse 1]
Shoot a movie in this bitch with extended clips (Extended clips)
Baby feel guilty when I knock down the handstand
Glock with a dick for a Jehovah if he witnessed it (No witnesses)
It's not about how you start, it's 'bout how you finish it
Shots to the face, no chaser (No chaser)
Fuck a fade, I'm only giving out tasers (Yeah)
Woke up early just to slide on you later (See you later)
I always keep a hard pole for a hater (Mop)
Two dicks, I'm with the full-fledged bullshit (With the bullshit)
It don't make sense, I can't pass through detention
I always stayed out, 'cause I was too high to fit in
No pot to piss in, now my gold really pissing
Blueface bust-down, Aquafina on my pinky (On my pinky)
Grown-ass man, baby, I ain't got no dependence (No dependence)
No forensics, no witness, no ballistics (No ballistics)
No attachments, but this Glock got extensions

[Chorus]
Stop cappin' (Stop cappin'), I'm really popping (Popping)
How can I slip if I'm the one doing the mopping?
No forensics, no witness, no ballistics (No ballistics)
No attachments, but this Glock got extensions
Stop the cappin' (Stop the cappin'), I'm really popping (Popping)
How can I slip if I'm the one doing the mopping?
No forensics, no witness, no ballistics (No ballistics)
No attachments, but this Glock got extensions

[Verse 2]
Stop cappin', I'm really popping
Pull up on your block with a stick and get to mopping
I'm literally talking in this bitch and it's still knocking
(This is knocking) She gon' pop it 'cause I'm popping
30 and a 40, feel like I'm squeezing a lemon (Lemon)
Bruce Lee wearing kicks fly, now this started kicking (Kicking)
Pop up, least expected like a mention (Like a mention)
Niggas want beef 'til I bring it to they attention
It's all fun and games 'til I pull up to your block trippin' (30)
Curry in the clip but I'm shooting like Scottie Pippen
Hot sauce, no drive-by, bounced out and walked up
Taped off, stop the capping, you niggas all talk

[Chorus]
Stop cappin' (Stop cappin'), I'm really popping (Popping)
How can I slip if I'm the one doing the mopping?
No forensics, no witness, no ballistics (No ballistics)
No attachments, but this Glock got extensions
Stop the cappin' (Stop the cappin'), I'm really popping (Popping)
How can I slip if I'm the one doing the mopping?
No forensics, no witness, no ballistics (No ballistics)
No attachments, but this Glock got extensions
