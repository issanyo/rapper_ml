[Intro: Blueface]
FBeat producin' all the heat
Ooh
Blueface, baby
Damn
Yeah aight
Yeah (I'm finna blow her back)

[Chorus: Blueface]
Ooh, damn, I'm finna blow her back
That must be jelly, 'cause jam don't shake like that
Her ass look like two midgets in a sleeping bag
She threw it back so you know I had to double back
Ooh, damn, I'm finna blow her back
That must be jelly, 'cause jam don't shake like that
Her ass look like two midgets in a sleeping bag
She threw it back so you know I had to double back

[Verse 1: Blueface]
Ooh, damn, she really throwin' ass
Make me bust fast
All that clappin', bitch I'm trained to bust back
I'm runnin' through the pussy like I'm a running back
Sweatin' the bitch weave out like the bitch been runnin' laps
Fuck roleplayin', see the ass, I don't know how to act
I tell the bitch to bend it over like a taco
Put my meat in her cheese, bitch I'm still not yours
Do a bitch cold and still give the bitch a poncho (Yeah aight)
I ain't text her back but she still got the message (She still got it)
Any bitch said I couldn't have it was dyslexic
I fucked my new bitch at the W just to flex on my exes
She workin' for the nut, matter fact she finna clock in for the next shift
I got a bad bitch named Alexis
She ride the dick the best, like a fuckin' Lexus
She really throwin' ass, showin' ass
Ooh, damn baby, I'm finna blow her back

[Chorus: Blueface]
Ooh, damn, I'm finna blow her back
That must be jelly, 'cause jam don't shake like that
Her ass look like two midgets in a sleeping bag
She threw it back so you know I had to double back
Ooh, damn, I'm finna blow her back
That must be jelly, 'cause jam don't shake like that
Her ass look like two midgets in a sleeping bag
She threw it back so you know I had to double back

[Verse 2: 1Take Jay]
I'm like a nigga on the scene, these hoes can't walk past me
You actin' real bougie but your elbows ashy
No kids, they know I like a bitch that call me daddy
But bye-bye, we can't fuck if you ain't got a fatty
Pay for pussy, yeah, I wish a bitch would tax me
Niggas hatin', yeah, I wish a nigga would at me
They said I look like Kevin Hart, that's why I'm always laughin'
DM your main bitch and tell that bitch she can have me
Fire head, run that, the pussy weak, punt that
Thick bitches, love that, been there, done that
I cheat but she come back, you mad, you a dumbass
No athlete, that good dick gon' make a bitch run laps
Blow a bitch back out, fuck her 'til she tap out
She go to sleep, blackout, I leave, I don't pass out
I'm broke, why your hand out? No J's, I don't camp out
She told me she was hungry so I pulled the food stamps out, bitch

[Chorus: Blueface]
Ooh, damn, I'm finna blow her back
That must be jelly, 'cause jam don't shake like that
Her ass look like two midgets in a sleeping bag
She threw it back so you know I had to double back
Ooh, damn, I'm finna blow her back
That must be jelly, 'cause jam don't shake like that
Her ass look like two midgets in a sleeping bag
She threw it back so you know I had to double back
