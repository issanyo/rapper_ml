[Intro]
Fuck a ho, I need dough
Kick a do', where's the dough?
Poured a fo', leave the sto'
Then I go, then I go
Fuck a ho, I need dough
Kick her doe, where's the dough?
Poured a fo', bleed the stove
Then I go, then I go

[Verse 1]
Niggas say they with the bullshits
'Til they meet a nigga who really with the bullshits
Now they scared to ride, then they scared to slide
Whatever for the dough, I never go broke
I ever go broke then I'm kickin' do'
Money or a ho? You'd probably chose a ho
You niggas weirdos, we could never relate
I'm fucking on the bitch, you taking her on dates
You're getting paid to hate, I'm just in a foreign
Slidin' with a foreign, tell her when to go
And the bitch goin'
Early bird catch the worm and you niggas snorin'
Man, you niggas sleepin'
I just popped a perc, got a nigga geekin'
You niggas really tweakin', you niggas not pimpin'
(Purchase your tracks today)
Nigga stop it, you niggas always poppin' it

[Chorus]
Fuck a ho, I need dough
Kick a do' where's the dough?
Poured a fo', leave the sto'
Then I go, then I go
Fuck a ho, I need dough
Kick a do', where's the dough?
Poured a fo', leave the sto'
Then I go, then I go

[Verse 2]
I'm in traffic (Skrrt-skrrt)
I believe in things, niggas really cappin'
Bitch, I'm really mackin'
These niggas really actin'
180 for the ball
Bitch, I'm really trappin'
Made these niggas boof
Nigga, I'm the truth
Crashing foreign coupes
Catching too many cases
I just killed the booth
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Man down)

[Hook]
Fuck a ho, I need dough
Kick her doe, where's the dough?
Poured a fo', bleed the stove
Then I go, then I go
Fuck a ho, I need dough
Kick her doe, where's the dough?
Poured a fo', bleed the stove
Then I go, then I go
