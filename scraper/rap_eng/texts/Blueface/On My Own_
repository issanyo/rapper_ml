[Chorus]
I'm in the zone, can't come to the phone
I did it on my own, I don't need no shooter
I'm in traffic with bazooka (I'm in traffic with bazooka)
Put a bullet to his scalp like bazooka
I'm in the zone, can't come to the phone
I did it on my own, I don't need no shooter
I'm in traffic with bazooka (I'm in traffic with bazooka)
Put a bullet to his scalp like bazooka

[Verse 1]
Put a bullet to his scalp like bazooka
Up the MAC, make this bitch sing like Luther
My Glock hate niggas, like the Ku Klux
I keep two things, so I can get two fucks
I'm in the zone, can't come to the phone
I got it on my own, I grind, not stay alone
This beat I get on, hoe
We can't fuck if you ain't got no O
All like a movie, baby, just play your part
You thought you'd push a Benz, now my bitch push a Start
Put the beef in the oven, just push to start
Keep the 40, fatter than Paul Blart
Catch a nigga slipping and I'm sliding like I'm at the park

[Chorus]
I'm in the zone, can't come to the phone
I did it on my own, I don't need no shooter
I'm in traffic with bazooka (I'm in traffic with bazooka)
Put a bullet to his scalp like bazooka
I'm in the zone, can't come to the phone
I did it on my own, I don't need no shooter
I'm in traffic with bazooka (I'm in traffic with bazooka)
Put a bullet to his scalp like bazooka

[Verse 2]
I won't let you niggas trick me out my spot
Oxycontin, baby, so I gotta keep some crack
I don't need no shooter, jave it, don't let the look fool ya
40 lifestyle leader, that is alright, do ya
Bullet to his scalp like bazooka
30 a clip instead of 30 trooper (30 in my clip)
One shot, clear out a parking lot
They don't bite, niggas is barkin' loud
I will never change (I will never change), I remain the same
But we are not the same
I got everything to lose, you got everything to gain
We do it for the fame, I did it for the game

[Chorus]
I'm in the zone, can't come to the phone
I did it on my own, I don't need no shooter
I'm in traffic with bazooka (I'm in traffic with bazooka)
Put a bullet to his scalp like bazooka
I'm in the zone, can't come to the phone
I did it on my own, I don't need no shooter
I'm in traffic with bazooka (I'm in traffic with bazooka)
Put a bullet to his scalp like bazooka
