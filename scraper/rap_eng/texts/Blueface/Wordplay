[Intro: Blueface]
Blueface Baby!
(Stop the sauce bittin')
Yeah, aight
(I'm really frostbitin')

[Chorus: Blueface]
Bitch, this only took one take
Six piece, wordplay, punchline
Stand a nigga up like a motherfuckin' date (Like a date)
I can give you the recipe, bet you the sauce still don't taste the same way (Stop the sauce bitin')
Bitch, this only took one take
Six piece, wordplay, punchline
Stand a nigga up like a motherfuckin' date (Like a date)
I can give you the recipe, bet you the sauce still don't taste the same way (Stop the sauce bitin')

[Verse 1: Blueface]
What's up with all this sauce bitin'?
Six piece, eighteen carats, bitch, I'm really frostbitin'
You niggas killin' me, what's up with all this net typin'?
How I'm supposed to respect a nigga that's on the net trippin'?
I really get to it the lip and the dash
Life is a bitch, it's not about how quick you can get it up, but how long you can last
Bitch, you hear that lisp
It's been regular, too many carats for a kiss
I'm a Crip, so if I pull it up she blue thick
"Blueface baby", that's all it took, now she choosin'
Bop! Bitch, I'm the bleeder, I'm something like Lebron when I pull up wit' that buzzer beater (Bop!)

[Chorus: Blueface & JamesTooCold]
Bitch, this only took one take
Six piece, wordplay, punchline
Stand a nigga up like a motherfuckin' date (Like a date)
I can give you the recipe, bet you the sauce still don't taste the same way (Stop the sauce bitin')
Bitch, this only took one take
Six piece, wordplay, punchline
Stand a nigga up like a motherfuckin' date (Like a date)
I can give you the recipe, bet you the sauce still don't taste the same way (Stop the sauce bitin')

[Verse 2: JamesTooCold]
Ayy, man, what's up with all this sauce bitin'?
Niggas ain't fightin', this .40 do him triflin'
It's fourty rounds in his head and the niggas that's right beside him
Oh boy, you broke, so where Franklin at? I guess he hidin'
And he got glue on his feet, bitch, you ain't ever slidin'
Ayy, damn, I hope the boys don't see this ratchet pokin'
And leave yo' house wit' a jacket 'cause I be fashion soakin'
Now he jokin', talk on the net, seen him but now he frozen
Birthday party, pass me the stick, I'm finna bust him open
Blueface, slow down the Benz, I'm tryna catch him slippin'
Big extensions, doo-doo-doo, that nigga steady trippin'
Blake Griffin, you ain't no shooter, bitch, I'm a foolie wit' it
Tryna bite this sauce, you can't do it if you ain't got no chicken

[Chorus: Blueface]
Bitch, this only took one take
Six piece, wordplay, punchline
Stand a nigga up like a motherfuckin' date (Like a date)
I can give you the recipe, bet you the sauce still don't taste the same way (Stop the sauce bitin', yeah, aight)
Bitch, this only took one take
Six piece, wordplay, punchline
Stand a nigga up like a motherfuckin' date (Like a date)
I can give you the recipe, bet you the sauce still don't taste the same way (Stop the sauce bitin')
