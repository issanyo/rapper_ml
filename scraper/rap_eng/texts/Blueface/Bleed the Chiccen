[intro]
Blueface, baby
Yeah, aight
Aight, Hmm

[Chorus]
Hm, bitch, make me bust fast
Ass fat
All that clappin', I'm trained to bust back (On the set)
Hm, nigga, say it’s beef
Leave him with ketchup and taco shells, where’s the meat?
(Where’s the beef?)
Hm, bitch, You see me pieced up
I need the whole thing, lil' nigga, I don’t want a piece of it
Hm, nigga, I chase money
Bitch, you lookin' at the boss, the manager, and the employee (Blueface, Baby)
Hm, bitch, make me bust fast
Ass fat
All that clappin', I'm trained to bust back (On the set)
Hm, nigga, say it’s beef
Leave him with ketchup and taco shells, where’s the meat?
(Where's the beef?)
Hm, bitch, you see me pieced up
I need the whole thing, lil' nigga, I don’t want a piece of it
Hm, nigga, I chase money
Bitch, you lookin' at the boss, the manager, and the employee (Blueface, Baby)

[Verse 1]
You ain't thinkin' 'bout no money, what the fuck is you thinkin'
She love how I start the song like I'm finna start singin'
(Blueface, baby)
Bitch, this ain’t no R&B
Blueface started actin' an ass talkin' 'bout how I mistreat (Stupid)
Dummy, avenue to the avenues (Shcoop!)
Long wood ave, cuz, where is your avenue?
On the gang, me and you are not the same
Your neck hurt from broke, stressin'
My neck hurt from these damn chains (Bling, blaw)
Ooh, damn, pieces on pieces
Pullin' up with foot long clips hidden under the seats, bitch (Over)
I ain't no pimp, I'm a mother-fuckin' crip (Shcoop!)
Play with my respect and it’s time to fuckin' trip (On the trip)
Ooh, damn, he may be up to mackin'
This ain't for show-and-tell, it's time to get shit crackin'
(Boom-boom-boom)
Bitch, you used to deny a niggas calls
See Blueface bussin' now you beggin', drop them pant drawers
Thank you, no thank you, now I'm not interested
All these bitches want a nigga, all I want is the dividends (aight)
Damn, I have a bitch that can’t listen
Don't chase me, bitch, chase the fuckin' chicken
(Chase the chicken)
Ooh, damn, bitch, I'm the truest
If Blueface can't, can't nobody fuckin' do it (Aight)
Stupid bitch, I'm the bleeder
Improvin' while this niggas tryna prove who really streeter
(Dumbass)

[Chorus]
Hm, bitch, make me bust fast
Ass fat
All that clappin', I'm trained to bust back (On the set)
Hm, nigga, say it’s beef
Leave him with ketchup and taco shells, where’s the meat?
(Where’s the beef?)
Hm, bitch, You see me pieced up
I need the whole thing, lil' nigga, I don’t want a piece of it
Hm, nigga, I chase money
Bitch, you lookin' at the boss, the manager, and the employee (Blueface, Baby)
Hm, bitch, make me bust fast
Ass fat
All that clappin', I'm trained to bust back (On the set)
Hm, nigga, say it’s beef
Leave him with ketchup and taco shells, where’s the meat?
(Where's the beef?)
Hm, bitch, you see me pieced up
I need the whole thing, lil' nigga, I don’t want a piece of it
Hm, nigga, I chase money
Bitch, you lookin' at the boss, the manager, and the employee (Blueface, Baby)
