You ain't gon' fall in love, baby, let's be serious
You don't never check, why you think you curious?
Pillow with the life though, this just for the night, though
Then I'm back to the door, show no love
Love will get you smoke
Let's fuck with no relations
No arguments and complaining
No late night waitin'
No complications

[Chorus: Blueface]
Pull up, L.A., park the Benz
I'm with my gang and bring her friends
Let's make a movie, never ends
I don't want no relations
I just want one night
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah

Pull up, L.A., park the Benz
I'm with my gang and bring her friends
Let's make a movie, never ends
I don't want no relations
I just want one night
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Joey Franko]
You see these bands? Baby girl tryna fuck the kid
She wanna love, but I don't trust, she can't get these trips
And that's on deck, she not the one, just her fucking dip
Pull up in that Benz, looking cold, I give you the chins
Like Spike Lee, let's go make a film
I got Locs, so girl, bring some freaks
Roll up Wood, or some cooks, I'm pouring lean
Take cash, the label, that is the team

[Chorus: Blueface]
Pull up, L.A., park the Benz
I'm with my gang and bring her friends
Let's make a movie, never ends
I don't want no relations
I just want one night
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Pull up, L.A., park the Benz
I'm with my gang and bring her friends
Let's make a movie, never ends
I don't want no relations
I just want one night
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
