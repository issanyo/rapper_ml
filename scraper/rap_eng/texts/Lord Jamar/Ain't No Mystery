[Lord Jamar]
Well can you tell me where to find that Mystery God
I don't see him, so you know the shit is kinda hard
I searched and searched, but still there's no sign
It's gotta be a trick for the deaf dumb and blind
Now would you set up home, and wait for a Mystery God
To bring Food, Clothing, and Shelter?
Emphatically no!
Mathematically that just don't go
See me and my people been lost for over 400 years
And done tried this Mystery God
And all we got was hard times
Hunger and nakedness, from the snake that hissed
Beaten and killed by the ones
Who say, "Look to the sky for your piece of the pie"
And didn't want to tell you that God's within self
Bloodsuckers of the poor wanna keep your wealth
Keep you a slave, so you don't misbehave
You never know the truth til you're dead in your grave
That's when you wanna come back, but there ain't no haps
Traps, caught you like a good strong buck, now you're fucked!
But my Third Eye helps me see
That the Black Man's God and yo it ain't no mystery

[Sadat X]
Who is the Mystery God, have you seen him?
You can keep searchin for a trillion years
Keep spreadin dates but he never appears
Crazy delusions of a big white man
Sittin on the throne, magic wand in his hand..
"You go to heaven! Dude, you go to hell!"
Churches think this mystery seems to sell
Join the 10%, duty to sell the eighty-five
You got part of your salary when this old God arrives
I'll be gone, jetti, I nix comedy spook
John ? is foul, but he still know the truth
Organized crime, drop you off in America
Land of the brave, watch the man from the cave
Used to kneel to the cross for the war with the rappers
Used to think it great, to rest ? in plates
Used to pray on my knees to the Mystery for G's
But instead of gettin G's all I got was free cheese
And bad advice, a tie around my neck
Shoot on my collar, to cut off my breath
But now all that's over, reality rules
Deal strictly with the gospel of the ? schools
Preacher preacher you could never be my teacher
Dealin lies and deceit for some brothers from the street
Know that the Black Man is God (the Black Man's God)
There is no mystery

[Lord Jamar]
First soul, black like coal
The Original One, with the power of the sun
Allah's God, always has been always will be
Never could be, a fuckin mystery
But you pray for Jehovah to come
That'll be the day when you leave the slum
Until that time, you just keep eatin swine
Drinkin cheap wine on the welfare line

[Sadat X]
Who's the clown, that didn't paint Jesus brown?
Everybody knows the man was original
When the jam is over I'mma go and take my vegetable
Check buy a tech let loose in the Vatican
Courts writin lies, record company is mad again
They say "Sadat X is racist"
Because I love the black faces
So put your bible in the attic cause I didn't come for static
The True and Living G-O-D
It ain't no mystery
