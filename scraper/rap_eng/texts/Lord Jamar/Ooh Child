[Chorus 2x: Aisha Mike]
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh child, thing's get brighter

[Sadat X]
Yeah, now why they so worried about going to Mars
When there's a million black seeds in Africa who starve?
Mad people over here keep losing they jobs
Half the hood in the ground, and the rest behind bars
We want the money, the ice, the crib and the cars
Yo, the sky's the limit, so reach for the stars
But be careful of the choices you make, watch the snakes
Know who keep it real and who keep it real fake
And if you ever fall, you find out who's your friend
You got to brush the dirt off then you get back up again
Uh, and then you get back up
And when you back up on your game, watch them pop back up
Now with friends like that, nigga, who needs enemies?
Me grab the mic and spit bullshit? Nigga, please
I ain't trying to shovel bullshit through your system
I'm only trying to drop some jewels, I hope you listen, so

[Chorus 2x: Aisha Mike (Grand Puba)]
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
(When you caught up in the struggle and you just trying to get it right)
Ooh child, thing's get brighter
(Bust ya ass everyday cuz you wanna live a better life)
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
(If you focused)
Ooh child, thing's get brighter
(Stay on your grind, it's not hopeless)

[Lord Jamar]
Aiyo, why you looking so sad, it's not that bad
Things could be worse, you could have a toe-tag
So wipe away your tears, and just be glad you're here
You had worse things in life that you had to bare
A soft spot in my heart, so I had to care
I couldn't stand by, watch a grown man cry
So I offer my condolence, and told him
To stand on his feet and walk to his destiny
I'm never gonna let these muthafuckas get the best of me
Addressing me, put up a fight or, put up your life
Put up or shut up, when you put up a price
I'm not a gambling man, so I put up the dice
I like control in the odds and, holding the cards
They brought drugs to the hood and they got sold to the Gods
But still through it all, we refuse to submit
And that's why we choose to spit real shit, like

[Chorus]

[Grand Puba]
Time stand still on a day that's slow
Bills piled up on the living room floor
Hard to work it out when it's only just me
Even with the glasses, feel like I can't see
Some days on my budget, I can't even cop trees
They trying to break the God, and bring you down to my knees
Combined with these is the fact that my daughter's far away
That's why I speak to her daily so I know that she's ok
But don't pity on your boy, cuz I be aight
But everything come to light, and everyday'll be bright
And ya mind and your body is solved
And the problems won't seem to harm in your mental
And A.S.P.'s in your residential, that's the cause
Of celebrating, where the babies could grow
And you ain't gotta lock your doors, told to
Elimination of wars, where the diseases of the world is just a bygone

[Chorus]

[Aisha Mike]
Some day, we'll put it together and we'll get it all done
Some day, your head is much wider
Some day, we'll walk in the wings of a beautiful sun
Some day, then the rays is much brighter

[Chorus]
