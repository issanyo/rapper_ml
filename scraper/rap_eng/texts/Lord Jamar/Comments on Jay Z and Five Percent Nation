Seemed like there was a lot of uproar over Jay Z wearing a Five Percent Nation chain

[Lord Jamar]
Hmm

[Vlad]
How long have you been a Five Percenter?

[Lord Jamar]
Ah... I want say, y'know, around 30 years

[Vlad]
Are you aware that Jay Z's a Five Percenter?

[Lord Jamar]
Uh, no I am not

[Vlad]
So you have no idea whether it's just a chain or whether he's actually a part of the Five Percent Nation?

[Lord Jamar]
I have no idea... I mean, there's been little hints, you understand what I'm saying? I've heard him for a while now, dropping little things in his music. Saying little, giving slight acknowledgements to the Gods, and uh shit even to us. Y'know? "Only God can judge me so I'm gone. Either love me or leave me alone." Y'know what I mean? And especially on the last album, on that Holy Grail, y'know he got a song called Heaven where he's shouting out the Gods basically, "Arm Leg Leg Arm Head this is God body". But as far as actually coming out and proclaiming that he's God, and coming amongst the Gods, and building with the Gods, and making knowledge born, making understanding understood, he has not done that. That's something that if he is interested in obtaining knowledge of self or if he has been studying unbeknownst to us, that's something that we'd like to know, y'know? Because we love to welcome him in, and make sure that what he's learning, he's learning correctly. But usually someone who's not in the Five Percent Nation doesn't wear our flag. Y'know what I mean? That's something that's usually reserved for people within the Nation. The Nation of Gods and Earths. So, y'know, I'm not upset with him. It's not like I'm upset that he's wearing it. I think it's actually, it's helping to raise awareness about us

Listen, I seen 'Melo with a similar chain. The first time I saw it I thought it was 'Melo's chain. Now I know that Jay Z is into the sports management and all of that right now. So my initial thing when I first saw him wearing it was almost like "Oh he trying to get at 'Melo right now". Y'know what I mean he trying to get 'Melo down with that Roc Nation sports shit and he's letting him know like "I fucks with you. I fucks with the Gods, I know about the Gods." Or maybe that was 'Melo's and 'Melo's his homeboy and he was like "Let me rock that chain", I don't know

See it's all the mystery surrounding it. See within the Five Percent Nation we make knowledge born, we make knowledge known, y'know what I mean? And we make understanding understood so that you have a crystal clear picture in your mind what's going on. The mysterious nature of not knowing exactly why he's wearing it and what the significance is to him is... it's not in line with how we usually do things

[Vlad]
Y'know when you look at the backlash over Jay Z wearing that Five Percent chain was that, y'know, one of the ideas of the Five Percent Nation in the media is that the Five Percent feels that white people are Devils. According to you, are white people Devils?

[Lord Jamar]
Yep. (Laughs) But now with that being said, white people come from the black man and the original Devil, the strongest Devil, is the black devil. So are white people Devils by themselves? No. They come from a stronger version of the Devil, which was the original black man. And when we speak of God and Devil, we are not speaking in the same terms that you would think of a God and Devil, how you've been traditionally taught as far as within religion. We redefine what God and Devil is, and what it means to us, and it's not anything spooky, it's a frame of mind, basically. And even white and black, is not necessarily a skin color it's a frame of mind. So is the white man the Devil? Yes he is. But do I mean just the caucasian skinned person? No, the white man of mind, the white mind, the one that goes against nature, the one that murders and rapes and steals, the unrighteous mind, is the Devil. And that can be within all different skin colors of people. But yes, the white man is the Devil
