[Intro: (Sampled vocals)]
(In the street, on the, on the, corner, in the street)
(In the street, on the corner")

[Hook: Lord Jamar (sampled vocals)]
They got crack they got guns (On the corner)
I seen niggas die young (In the street)
They got, females for sale (On the corner)
Mad niggas in jail, for running wild (In the street)

[Verse 1: Lord Jamar (Sampled vocals)]
Yo, I attended UCLA, now how that grab you?
The University of the Corner of Lincoln Avenue
Where no sleep is lost when they think of stabbing you
Leave you in the playground laying face down
And I'm not DeAndre, this is not HBO
This is real life, and it's real trife
Sometimes it's too much to fathom
Coroner come through, they just bag 'em and tag 'em
Just the other day, I was copping weed (on the corner)
Man, I seen a nigga get shot, he was laying out (in the street)
The blood started to leak from his head
He was dead, I was just standing feet away
You never know if today's gon' be the day
That you get killed, blood get spilt
All over the pavement, be careful 'cause

[Hook: Lord Jamar (sampled vocals)]
They got crack they got guns (On the corner)
I seen niggas die young (In the street)
They got, females for sale (On the corner)
Mad niggas in jail, for running wild (In the street)

[Verse 2: Lord Jamar]
Yo, she used to be a dime piece, back in '82
She was the shit, then she got strung out on the shit
Now her beauty's drained, from the cocaine
Her once delicate speech is now profane
Remnants of her formal self, catch a trick's eye
She suck anonymous dick and then gets high
She on the block 'til the wee hours
And I wouldn't fuck with her even if she took three showers
With eight AIDS tests, she's a straight mess
She look older than she is, cause she stays  stressed
The whole hood know her, we ambivalent
A mixed up girl, who lost her innocence
What's really sad is that she's not the only one
Her life is bad, but she's not the only one
There's plenty more, the streets got plenty whores
Pimp profit, bank corners on twenty fours

[Hook: Lord Jamar (sampled vocals)]
They got crack they got guns (On the corner)
I seen niggas die young (In the street)
They got, females for sale (On the corner)
Mad niggas in jail, for running wild (In the street)

[Verse 3: Grand Puba]
Yeah, now a new born baby from the hospital
Headed to the hood to face them obstacles
Of the gangsters, killing, fiends and drug dealings
Those who get caught, get pinched and start squealing
The have nots, stuck in the hood, that stays hot
Like crabs in the barrel trying to make it to the top
With petty ass beef, gat handles with the Glock
When innocent kids wind up getting shot
Where murder is a trend, selling drugs is a hobby
And moms and grandmoms scared to walk through the lobby
Where young men, don't get a chance to be men
Locked up or shot down, all they was taught was sin
Where young girls walk around the hood with no clothes
Thinking it's alright from watching them videos
This shit is by design, programmed your mind
With a savage way of thinking, leaving you dumb, deaf & blind, so

They got crack they got guns (On the corner)
I seen niggas die young (In the street)
They got, females for sale (On the corner)
Mad niggas in jail, for running wild (In the street)
