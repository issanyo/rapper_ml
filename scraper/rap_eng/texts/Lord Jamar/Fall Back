Verse 1

Ayo fall back
You ain't all that
Your money small
I got tall stacks
You made a call
You better call back
Right on your face
Your gonna fall flat
Stressing me with a chick
What you call that
Need to hop off my dick and my ball sack
Cuz I spaz out quick I will brawl cats
Anything goes
Even baseball bats
My whole team rocks yankee baseball hats
We will lay you out clean floormats
Now im back on the scene where the whores at
Im about to spend green they adore that
Grey goose roz√© we can pour that
The way we play you couldn't afford that
Every club im like where the back door at
Then I slide to the crib with a four pack

Hook

Fall back
When you see me at the bar and I'm trying to get a drink
Why you leaning on me
Fall back
When I'm chillen in the club got my bottles on E in the VIP
Fall back
Cause she dancin on me I'm trying to get it in she's coming home with me
Fall back
Cuz your man acting crazy and he's about to get slapped if he's stunting on me
Fall back
Fall back little sucker fall back
Fall back little sucker fall back
Fall back little sucker fall back
Fall back little sucker fall back

Verse 2

Move bitch get out the way
You need to fall back and get out my face
I'm on the dancefloor need to get out my space
Got my hands on her waist making plains for her face
Might spend a couple grand in the place
Your the type to catch a couple cans of the mace
It's king primo
I bag chicks thats thick
And stack more chips than a casino
We standing on the couch with the pino
Later I'm landing in her mouth with my penis
She's from mars, I'm from venus
Up in the bars I'm the cleanest
We the stars with the fans in arenas
We got the cars and the fans wanna meet us
That's why security is telling you to back up
Too many chicks on my dick I need back up

Bridge

To all my thugs in the club with the bottles of bub
Gotta grenade following showing too much love
Tell her fall back, fall back, tell her fall back, fall back

To all my ladies in the place with style and grace
Got a hounding motherfucker all up in your face
Tell him fall back, fall back, tell him fall back, fall back

Verse 3

Fall back like you just got pushed
Or smoked a whole pund of kush
Your old girl just might get smushed
I never beat around the bush
I get straight to it
Yes I just do it
I'm looking at that ass
I like the way she move it
Girl you know that you all that
Get your walls cracked and tell your man
