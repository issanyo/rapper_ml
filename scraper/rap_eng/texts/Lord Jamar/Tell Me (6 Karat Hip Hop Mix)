[Verse 1: Amel Larrieux]
I've been doing my own thing
Love has always had a way of having bad timing
But to my great surprise, ever since I looked in your eyes
I had one question for you

[Chorus 1: Amel Larrieux]
Tell me if you want me to give you all my time
Wanna make it good for you 'cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true, you're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to

[Verse 2: Amel Larrieux]
If you've thought I'd sleep on this
Boy, you're wrong cause all I dream about is our first kiss
And you're the first one to make me feel like this
And this is one opportunity that I can't miss, no, no
Boy, you wanna know the deal
You are wondering if the words I'm saying are for real
'Cause you got more appeal than any man in this whole world
And baby, I got to know how you feel, yeah

[Chorus 1: Amel Larrieux]
Tell me if you want me to give you all my time
Wanna make it good for you 'cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true, you're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to

[Verse 3: Sadat X]
All right, then, it's on, I want your two cents of greatest
Let's make love or war to the floor
Mind over matter makes your whole style phatter
I'm a put you on instead of wishing that I had her

[Verse 4: Lord Jamar]
Let's make a move, I'm not leery
About your groove theory
Show them proof you wanna get near me
Lord Jamar of the dealie
Painting pictures clearly
And me and you multiplying clearly fortifying
Love that I'm supplying

[Chorus 2 (until fade): Amel Larrieux]
Tell me if you want me to
I wanna make it good for you
I promise, girl, that I'll be true
So tell me if you want me to
Tell me if you want me to
I wanna make it good for you
I promise, girl, that I'll be true
So tell me if you want me to
