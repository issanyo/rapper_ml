[Intro]
"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh"
"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh"

[Chorus]
You tried to do me, you tried to do me (Tried to do me, God)
You tried to do me, but I am not the one
(But see baby, I am not the one, baby)
You tried to do me, you tried to do me (You tried to do me)
You tried to do me, but I am not the one
(Yeah, yo, check this out)

[Verse 1: Grand Puba Maxwell]
Why you wanna live so foul?
You know, sweatin', one for some, is not my style
I'm the type to wine and dine and the candlelight
Cause just one night could be just so right
Your first riff is that I'm never home
And you're, sick and tired of bein' alone
But baby, I got work to do
And ain't no-one gonna stop me from bein' Pu'
I buy you rings and things and all that good stuff
But you still beefin' that that is not enough
Let's sit down and discuss it
Baby bust it (Hey, hey)
You check my beeper when I'm still sleepin'
When I get out of cars, you're out your window peepin'
I think the best thing for you and me
Is just to play like John Lennon and let it be
You tried to do me

[Chorus]
You tried to do me, you tried to do me (Yeah, but you see baby)
You tried to do me, but I am not the one (I am not the one)
You tried to do me, you tried to do me (You tried to do me, yeah)
You tried to do me, but I am not the one (Ay, bust it)

[Verse 2: Grand Puba Maxwell]
I would sing the song called, "Just Be My Lady"
But you're the type of girl who likes to act real shady
And rain on the brain like a hurricane
Throw rhythm on a dame, 'cause I know the game
You see, I'm just a rapper and nothing's free so...
"Why are you watchin' me?"
Well honey, can I get some privacy?
You say "cool," then you try to flip
But you forgot to put the Gucci bag upon your hip
You knew me, you blew me, others would pursue me
The question that I ask is why you, tryin' to do me?
Make like a ship and just float on (float on)
I'm not the type of brother that you can just gig on
I know the time honey, there it is plain to see
You're tryin' to do me

[Hook]
You tried to do me, you tried to do me (You tried to do me)
(Yeah, but you see baby) You tried to do me, but I am not the one
(I am not the one)
You tried to do me, you tried to do me (I ain't havin' it)
You tried to do me, but I am not the one (Yeah)

[Interlude]
"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh"
"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh"
Now see, baby
I don't know why you tryin' to flip and all of that
Cause I'm out here tryin' to do my thing and get these papes in today's society
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm tryin' to make things a little better
But if you wanna make matters worse, let me say this first
There's no need for you to try to do me

[Chorus]
You tried to do me, you tried to do me (You tried to do me, honey)
(You tried to do me, babe) You tried to do me, but I am not the one
(But you see, I am not the one)
You tried to do me, you tried to do me (You tried to do me)
(Yeah) You tried to do me, but I am not the one
(And now check it, I'ma end it like this)

[Verse 3: Grand Puba Maxwell]
Good times come, honey, good times go
I think this is somethin' that you really oughta know
The name of the game is to maintain
Cause when you lose someone you love, then you feel pain
It's up to you to decide if the love was worth losin'
To me you're not the everyday, Tina, Tammy, Susan
Why can't you, understand?
Instead of tryin' to run the flim-flam on the Grand
Baby, do whatever is clever
Cause we can make this last forever and ever (Make it last forever, oh yeah)
With joys, there's pain
But don't you worry about the Puba Maxwell, cause I can stand the rain
Shoo-be-doo, this is what you oughta do
Think of all the things that I just told you
Remember all the times when I used to hold you and say
We can last through eternity
But don't ever try to do me

[Outro]
"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh"
"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh"
"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh"
"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh"
