[Intro: Lord Jamar]
Yo motherfucker, I don't rhyme like you (what?)
You'se a pig eating nigga, I don't swine like you
Yo hold up... let me run that back again
In case these niggas didn't hear, check it

[Lord Jamar]
Yo motherfucker, I don't rhyme like you (no)
You'se a pig eating nigga, I don't swing like you
You wanna rhyme about jewelry, tom foolery
Now how the fuck is you schooling me?
You ain't got shit to say
You got the same shit to say, that your man said yesterday
Let me guess, your rims are twenty plus, ain't it
Cause in your pants, you got three inches
It's like penises, can give a fuck if I'm not seeming friendly
Insecure, all your pimps and whores, are you
Gods or Earths, I always kick the hardest verse
Let me show you how the smartest work
Y'all niggas keep rashing the subject
You under bashely, feeding that track to the public
You all wanna be the same living
I don't blame Jigga, but you wanna be him
You wanna be Puff, you wanna be Baby and Slim
You wanna be Suge Knight, no one crazy as him
Wanna claim 'thug life' with 30 days in the pen
Let's get right, time for Lord J to give

[Hook: Lord Jamar]
Yo, let's advance the game
How many times can we rhyme about cars and chains
How many bricks can a nigga really sell
How many times can a nigga really go to jail
How many murders can you do on one album
Put 'em together, must've did about a thousand
I'm just saying let's change it up
If not, nigga, hang it up

[Lord Jamar]
A-yo, call me a hater, that's just what I expect
Defense mechanism put in effect
Say what you will, but still you know I'm right and exact
All I'm saying can we tighten the slack
Can you be a little original in writing your raps
You should all give residuals to Kool G. Rap
We done set up the game with the booby traps
Y'all some acting ass niggas with your movie raps
You all sound alike, like you all found the mic
The same day, rhyme the same way
Somebody change the rules to the game play
I thought the aim was to do your own thing
I'm just saying what some niggas is scared to
Or maybe lyrically unprepared to
Either way, I'm making Knowledge Born
Stop sucking these niggas, like a dick you was slobbing on

[Hook]

[Hook 2X: Lord Jamar]
Yo, be original (what) your shit is sloppy (that's right)
Get off the dick, you motherfucking carbon copy

[Lord Jamar]
You and your precious stones, without 'em you just flesh and bone
Some topics should be left alone
I'm not here to fucking sweat your chrome
You came here to fucking set the tone, nigga
I ain't mad that you got what you got
But you sing about the shit, a whole motherfucking lot
Do me a favor, keep it to yourself
Give me information that can help, put the bullshit on your shelf

[Hook]
