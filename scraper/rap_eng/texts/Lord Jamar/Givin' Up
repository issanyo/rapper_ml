Givin' up... is hard to do (3x)
When youuuuuuu, givin' up someone

[Lord Jamar]
Yo, maybe I should rhyme about guns and crack
Then I might sell like tons of stacks
Sometimes I tell myself, fuck the truth
"But it's just no use"
Shit, I can rhyme about bitches and cars
I even tried switching my bars
I said righteous rap is dead to make an excuse, but
"No I can't break loose"
Sometimes I think about leaving again
Already accomplished in leaving a name
Maybe I should just go out with a bang
"But it's just no use"
I can't do it, my love for black people's too strong
Rhymed with a purpose for too long
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to refuse
"No I can't break loose"

When youuuuuuu, givin' up someone

[Lord Jamar]
They tried to offer me platinum and diamonds
Anything to make me stop rhyming
They went through great lengths to try to seduce
"But it's just no use"
Cause I, can't be bought, I can't be sold
I'm understanding God, I can't be old
Some people just can't be told
"No I can't break loose"
Somebody gotta be the voice of reason
Especially when it's killing season
We trying to close the wound, the blood is perfused
"But it's just no use"
Penitentiary steel, we got centuries
At bedtime, doing fed time
I'mma have to get my sentence reduced
"No I can't break loose"
