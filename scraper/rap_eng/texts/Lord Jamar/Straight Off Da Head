Record after record, yeaaah, rhyme after rhyme check it

[Sadat X]
In the studio, on the first try
On the verse high only birds fly
You get out the pack like that y'all
Straight off da head (what?), let niggas know I use to wear the pro
Get three strikes yo, I used to have to court awarder
But now I got a daughter and she gotta grow
And I let her know that that ain't the way to go
My name is X, yo I'm like a puzzle when I get released
Just like I had my muzzle off, check it out yo

You don't stop (and you don't quit) and you don't stop
(We're makin hit after hit after hit y'all) Ya don't stop

[Lord Jamar]

Straight down on Flatbush Ave
Some of the streets in Brooklyn'll make you laugh
Names like Myrtle and Willoughby
Things like Scurmerhorn and Classun
And funny names like that but still they got the gats rollin

With the one blade, ever since the first grade

And watch em how they did things and I learned it well
