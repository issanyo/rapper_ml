[Chorus: Nina Simone's "Here Comes the Sun"]
Here comes the sun, little darling
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
Here comes the sun, little darling
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right

[Verse 1]
Well, here come the sun, here come the one
It's Lord Jamar, a new day has begun
Just look at me shine as I rise in the east
I welcome you with the universal greeting of peace!
Don't look directly at me, my light is too intense
And it covers the spectrum, that why brothers respect it
I bring life to the planet, I make sight in advantage
I do damage but without me you could never manage
Now here comes the sun, the moon and the stars
You could feel my heat, no matter where you are
I sizzle the street, the leather in your car
Hotter than the Middle East (where?) candle hot
And everything revolve around me
Look at the Earth, she revolve around me
But she keep the boundaries
'Cause one wrong turn and she might get sunburn

[Chorus: Nina Simone's "Here Comes the Sun"]
Here comes the sun, little darling
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
Here comes the sun, little darling
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right

[Verse 2]

[Chorus: Nina Simone's "Here Comes the Sun"]
Here comes the sun, little darling
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
Here comes the sun, little darling
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right

[Verse 3]
I keep my Earth ninety three million miles away
But she still feel my warm when I'm touching here face, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
I keep my Earth ninety three million miles away
But she still feel my warm when I'm touching here face, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right

[Chorus: Nina Simone's "Here Comes the Sun"]
Here comes the sun, little darling
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
Here comes the sun, little darling
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
