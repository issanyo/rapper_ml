[Lord Jamar]
First up it's the knots up, what's up
To the niggas from the projects
Prospect Park in Brooklyn, I'm lookin at another crime scene
Committed by the brothers on this rhyme team
Just freestylin' in a cipher, might take the life of MCs
If you're wack we got the right to seize
Ease back like Ultra, know your culture
Motherfuckers don't know so they won't grow
Lord Jamar show and prove the rules I kick
Makin niggas move, no matter how smooth it get
Or how rigid, niggas still get it
I kill wicked motherfuckers with the rhymes that I structures
In my third eye, know you heard I
Study math like a mathmatician
See half of y'all wishin you could sound like the GODs from the town
Of the Rule, you ain't got the urge, bust it down Serge

[Serge]
You know I smoke it like the flame to the tip of that bud we just twisted
From another dimension, did I mention
That funky, that's the only way we know how to get
Niggas' rhymes be limited like a partial scholarship
But my style's so heavy it make me lean when I drop
Leave you spinnin like the washin machine before it stop
Going all out, have to seal these motherfuckers fate
On a mission from Cleveland, ridin it from outta state
So ready yourself because it's on full scale
I hooks up with Jamar to bail down to New Rochelle
Now Rule, that's where we scheme and we plot
On the late night, blunted in the basement with Sadat
And we discussin your demise, know it's gonna come
Sure as the sun's gonna rise, send me the drum
And Serge is buckin off a shot from the mental with insight
Air tight, while we're working from cradle to gravesite

[Maestro Manny]
I feel lick a shot pum pum, push up on the one
All bang bang and no run
Original Flatbush style, control the jam
Like BEEP Han Solo man
Yes-a, Mr.Intellect-And-Sex in the flesh
I'm rougher than the hair on your girl's chest
Maestro Manny one verse, time come in
My mic ??? stop when they go for it
You don't concern me, your style can't burn me
You's about as hardcore as Big Bird, Bert and Ernie
My steelo fat like your girlfriend, pregnant with twins
After Thanksgiving then they're eatin pork skins
I don't give a fuck about your section, just watch your murder flexin
Step correct to the brother with the dark complexion
6' 1-2 even, cocked diesel
Conceited, hair is curly, ain't no fuckin up like ???
SEE!!!!

*Interlude*

[Snagglepuss]
When the corrupt stuff on my mind starts to erupt
Even the hard niggas will be yellin "That's enough"
But what about my style, ooh child, I switch em up
Rearrange em up, in other words I change em up
Snagglepuss, I make a nigga fall like the season
So exit stage left cos you ain't on my level even
You wanna battle? Here's what happened to the last kid
His wife became a widow and his kids became bastards
In the rap profession, I'm not the one for testin'
I'm the first to let'cha know I fight dirty like mud wrestling
So bring all the flunkies you roll with
So when I set it on you they can all be like "Oh shit!"
You want more so here we go, peep how my rap flow
I'll have your ass sneaking out the backdoor
This is some trouble you don't wanna get your ass in
So watch your step and don't come out'cha mouth in the wrong fashion

[Sadat X]
Feel the wind blow through your hair
My aim is square on your backbone
You're home alone and your mom work the double shift
Just enough time for me to hit that off
"Bounce on a nigga" said my man Wop
Peace to the squad, One-Eighth, Fo' and Teepee, check it
I'm the type of nigga that'll walk down the street
On some casual shit, even my kid could flip
Hear me on the wop tape BAM!! HIT EM
Hear me with the rhythm, yo you better go get em, check it
Anticipation, you're waiting and waiting
Peace to Courtland Ave., Teepee wheelnose in
Satan, the early bird, aiyo that's my word
My man Joon with the herb to the moon
Eh Shawn Black, nigga, where ya at?
No type of daydreamer or a nigga with emphysema
This is X and I'm straight from the Rule
