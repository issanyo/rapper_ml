[Hook]

We ain't trying to hear shit but what? (Cash money)
The whole world operating off of (Cash money)
To all my niggas with a whole lot of (Cash money)
Watch yo' back money

[Verse 1]

You couldn't never understand how my mind tick
I'm on some old school crime shit
When niggas sold two's to keep the dimes lit
Ain't no rules when these iron shots are stoned dun

This heat burn through your flesh, straight to the bones
I reach for the buddha cess and zone
I probably have a future of stress, stay depressed and be alone
But as far as the present time its on

I represent mine til I return to the essence and I'm dead and gone
Put me on the corner, watch me catch a quick case of cream fever
If you be popping shit my niggas won't believe ya
Probably punch you in the face and take ya wallet when we see ya

But son it gets deeper
I'm running with a click that's being hunted by the grim reaper
To all my peoples in the man keeper
Let your situation be a teacher
Ain't nothing like a education

When I was locked down I learned about patience and dedication
And not to say shit, unless you need a motherfucking face lift
And as a youth I was a outcast
Running around with pellet guns playing war but now it's all about cash

[Hook (version 2)]

I'm caught up, caught up in a mix of shit
And I ain't trying to hear shit son my crew got cash to get
Blast you with the pistol
If I have to, in my mind its all about cash in the fistful
I'm caught up in a mix of shit
And I ain't trying to hear shit son my crew got cash to get
Splash you with the pistol
If I have to, in my mind its all about cash in the fistful

[Verse 2]

Up late night and upset, and fed up
Niggas coming up, wet, I'm dead up
Fuck trying to your head up
And when it go down, word bond we gotta get up
Too many locked down upstate, son its a set up

My life has sped up, many years I'm straight up
Plenty beers for who ain't here and those who ate up
Test and get sprayed up in the club
We couldn't run it so we take the blade up in the booth
Since we couldn't shoot

We heat it up, losing the shirt, showing the bare chest
I'm blessed, puffin the skunk make me care less
The best that you can do is duck my fucking crew
If the slugs don't get you, lord J'll jig you

Actin artificial you'll get burnt by the pistol
Before its done, even my guns'll turn to missiles
Don't have to blow the whistle on you
Cause everybody knows you gotta watch yo self around borderline pyschos

Who know my people gotta hold a mint
Or they ain't worth a cent
How can you represent, if you can't pay the rent
And leave a dent in my life time, I'm caught up in trife crime
In fights you never know what you might find

We stand firm meanwhile cause niggas that seem wild
Be bucking blanks, if they were men they wouldn't fuck with pranks
I leave them niggas alone and stay home
Until it cool down as they remember how my tool sound

[Hook]

We ain't trying to hear shit but what? (Cash money)
We whole world operating off of (Cash money)
To all my niggas with a whole lot of (Cash money)
Watch yo' back money (yeah yeah)

[Interlude]

Yeah, we up on what we dealing with
We ain't no criminals
We got the right to have gats
As long as the army, navy, air force, marines got gats
We gon' hold heat, knamsayin?
Cause our army gotta represent for us
Word up
Aiyyo, Maintain (Yeah)
Set that shit son

[Verse 3: Maintain]

Forever keeping my shit cocked for drama
Stainless steel, shit is for real
The way these rats is known to squeal, making sour deals
Thugs up in the mix to these drugs, caught up in the humble
Bricks and paper by the bundle how the Bronx rumble

??? devils get deaded, never regret it, only known to set it
Still in existence obviously you jetted
Speak the desert, I see the pyramid and eagle
Back of the dollar bill, ill deceitful, we consider lethal

God falling, niggas be pouring, guzzling alcoholics
Two drinks, too many's like whitey infiltrating your fortress
Shit is on, we 'bout to form, best prepare for the storm
Ya'll funny niggas quick to ring the alarm

Bomb fell, now a nation is gel
We had to dwell for four hundred or more
The Lord had the righteous living poor
Resurrecting the true and living back the power
Devils getting devoured, niggas heard the god holla
