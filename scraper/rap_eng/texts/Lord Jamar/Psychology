[Intro]
I was born, in a dump
My mama died and my daddy got drunk
He left me, to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road
I grew up in a rusty shack
All I owned was hangin on my back
And Lord knows, how I loathe
This place called Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road, you're dirty and you're filthy
Tobacco Road, gonna get me some dynamite and a crane
I'm gonna blow it up, Lord knows gonna start all over again

My mind is the place where I make my plans
The world is the place where I take my stand
The beauty of life is mine today
They cannot take my mind away

[Verse 1: M-1]
Fuck what you heard, I'm from Africa
This ain't no act it's mathematical
Past the black radical
I choose the M-1 because it's practical
Nothin was changed, we ain't protected
No names, it's all factual
They push the wrong buttons, count down to detonate
Brooklyn blown away and the world will have to speculate
This is what we learn in the streets, fuck a degree
Believe in none of what you hear and half of what you see

[Verse 2: stic.man]
It's like watching your own father smoke crack
I have nightmares on shit like that
No way in hell I'll ever get like that
I seen a lot of shit in twenty-two years
It's like a tour of duty
My life is booby-trapped, it's hard to see the beauty
When your heart is turning ice cold
Cold like your hands exposed to blistering winds
My mother keep her eyes closed, she say she prayin
I listen close to what she sayin
When she speak of Jesus I ignore it
But when it's practical I'm all for it
You got to think like a soldier
I'm training myself to snatch pistols out of holsters
Discipline keep the mind focused
This whole world is a corn field son
Look out for flying locusts

[Chorus]
Don't let 'em get in your head, they try to probe you
Figure your thoughts so they can try and control you
And through you, control your whole crew
It's psychology boy, now what the fuck that make you wanna do?
Don't let 'em get in your head, they try to probe you
Figure your thoughts so they can try and control you
And through you, control your whole crew
It's psychology boy, now what the fuck that make you wanna do?

[Verse 3: M-1]
You can't walk the streets with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
And if you know the time, give me a sign
Tell me where we draw the line, I got your back if you got mine
My enemy's enemy is my man, one dreadlock is stronger than one strand
While the crackers got the upper hand my comrades stands
On lands stolen
Every tooth a golden opportunity, who holding my community
Hostage? 10% ransom
Costing us time we lost and some
This is how the plan runs, thinking with a fugitive brain
What we do to live is insane
Hold in the weed, healing my membranes, just like crack
You know it all boils down to the dollars-and-cents of it
Niggas commence to get rents to sentenced to serve terms
Jumping the fence, the black germ is loose
When will they learn?
Psychology

[Verse 4: stic.man]
We piss on walls and smoke reefa in the halls
No respect for their laws
I cut your face with a kitchen knife
In gladiator times, man against machinery
The tree bark fatigues help me blend in with the scenery boy
Life is a series of serious choices
Theories is formed from experience, never mysterious forces
Various courses of life can lead to failure
Too much of anything is a trap
My mind snap
Guerilla warfare for two grand
They say karate means 'empty hands'
So then it's perfect for the poor man...
They say karate means 'empty hands'
So then it's perfect for the poor man

[Chorus]
Don't let 'em get in your head, they try to probe you
Figure your thoughts so they can try and control you
And through you, control your whole crew
It's psychology boy, now what the fuck that make you wanna do?
Don't let 'em get in your head, they try to probe you
Figure your thoughts so they can try and control you
And through you, control your whole crew
It's psychology boy, now what the fuck that make you wanna do?

[Bridge]
Organize
We won't survive
If we don't realize
We are sure to die
Psychology

[Outro 1: M-1]
When you think of us think of pyramids and pistols
And glimmering gold teeth that shine like crystals
The mind is like a jewel son
Only a fool wouldn't grasp it
Wisdom is a tool, you get blasted
When you think of us think of pyramids and pistols
And glimmering gold teeth that shine like crystals
The mind is like a jewel son
Only a fool wouldn't grasp it
Wisdom is a tool, you get blasted

[Outro 2]
Free your mind, and the rest will follow
Seize the time, no one is promised tomorrow
Free your mind, and the rest will follow
Seize the time, no one is promised tomorrow
Free your mind, and the rest will follow
Seize the time, no one is promised tomorrow
