Yours truly, far from booty, Starang Wondah (*Clapping*), AKA Gunn Clappa Numba One (I love that guy, man), so it’s only right I be fhe first voice that you hear bringing you on this new B.C.C. expedition.  Duck Down staff is in the motherfucking house (*Clapping*), bringing you this Nocturnal LP (I love those guys).  Nocturnal!  Which means to live life at nighttime.  Daytime’s used to plot schemes for the night prowl, baby (*Clapping*).  In other words, we see through the bullshit niggas be trying to do.  So for this portion of the album, we bring forth Da Rockness Monstah (*Clapping*), you know what I’m saying?  (Bringing forth Heltah Skeltah) Boo-yaa!

[Verse 1: Rock]
You asked for it.  Who want beef?  Well, here’s war
For this, I’ll pack twin automatic four-fours
Fuck what you heard, don’t even speak ‘bout my fleet
Many pop shit but bitch when dem see me
Rock out of the realms of dark in Bucktown, me
And Ruck, we don’t give a “Wiggy” what now (“Wiggy” what now)
I wonder if heads are ready or are they butter? (They ain’t ready, son)
Ain’t near one of y’all bitch niggas tough —you could
Get your “Clan’s, Posse’s, Click’s,” bring the static, G
We starts mad Ruckus and Rock domes while we at it, G
My “Soldiers Gone Psycho,” let the madness begin-ah (Let it begin)
Enter “The Square” if you dare bring a friend.  We’ll
Snipe ya, we see in the dark like an owl, so
We “Prowl,” “Undastand” the plan is “Operation Lockdown” (“Operation Lockdown”)
Sean Price’ll slice that punk shit you repping, G
Drugs, jewels, and Versace, niggas need “Therapy”
Enter the “Grate Unknown,” Nocturnal adventures of
Sparsky and Dutch, the power forward and the center (However)
Needless to mention, this means war, so with the help of my
Twin shark and Boot Camp, I declare Heltah Skeltah

[Hook 2: Starang Wondah and Heltah Skeltah] (x4)
We be the
W.W. B.C.C., world-
-wide, worldwide Boot Camp Click till we D.O.-
-A.  We continue, smashing crews, ringing
More bells than mock raceways on avenues
