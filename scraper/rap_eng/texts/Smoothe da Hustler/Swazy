[Ice-T]
You know Smooth man, no matter..
No matter how much I love a bitch, man
I could be with a bitch and I really want to marry her, man

[Smooth] Uhha.. what?!

[Ice-T]
And it's something that goes on in my head I can't explain it

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]
Once I bust a nut I'm out
All the real niggas know what I'm talking about
We might take you out to dinner buy you shit, it's crazy
But once I bust a nut I'm Swazy

[Verse One: Smoothe Da Hustler]
I'm on a one O'clock booty call; this girl is a freak
Lights out, drop those drawers, pull back those sheets
But hold up, stand up and throw your head to your feet
And you can bite up on the pillow if I'm in too deep
Bad shots, always sad, I never cuddle in bed
I only cuddle your neck while you're giving me head
And that's all, and I told you, we can fly and the ball
But I'm wrong, we can do it up and buy out the mall
But I'm gone, I'm on the next bus, next club
Next slut, next fuck, fucking the next one, next up
Legs up, how many girls I done hit up and ran?
I'm like smooth I'm already trying to fuck your friends
Then I'm...

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Sometimes my dick gets hard as a pole
Fucked so many bitches, think my dick went gold
I love the stripping bitches, dancing bitches, fat butt whores
I love the high heeled bitches with them sexy toes
If you're really hot, I might buy you some clothes
Fat enough ass, you'll get to ride on my rolls
Good enough head, might get you some gold
But once I bust off; Daddy is back on the road
Cause once I hit the drawers, I start noticing flaws
Didn't realize your gut was that big or that wig
I'm back in the same club I met you slut
Bitches just demanding me, hard dick insanity
I really loved you up until I fucked you
Uhh.. once I skied, it's kinda like a track meet
How fast can I get some fresh pussy on my dick?
A different type whore, a different color bitch

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Three: Deuce Fever]
I got go to put my pants on
She said where are you going handsome?
Trying to hold a nigga for ransom
After all the shit I bought and then some
Smiling with her mouth full of cum, another one dumb dumb
Got to go, got another whore, waiting for me in the lobby, yo
And plus, she got body too
She is beautiful, toes done to the cuticle
Hold up Ma, you know, what I'll do to you? "BITCH!!"
Chew you out, beat it up, put it your butt
Blindfold you, hand cuffed, then mind mold you
It's all gravy, baby, When I roll through
Bag your whole crew, we can Menage-a-trois it up
While your girl licking my butt
Rubbing my gut, playing with my nuts
Love your shape, wanna squeeze and hold you
Bitch, what I told you?

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Four: Trigger Tha Gambler]
I got this thing for titties and long hair, bitches with curves
But I kick them to the curbs, if they get on my nerves
I swerve to the right, hit the lock, hit the block
Think I'm feeling that hard, to stop playing?
Cause I.. beg them, bag them, beat them in the head
Later, they beat me and beg to meet me in the bed
Damn!! I'm such a good talker
I'm like fuck her cause I could fuck her
But then I threw her dick suck offer
Now homegirl flipping, in her own world tripping
She falls for anything, old girls slipping
I told her roll with her homegirl, both girls dipping
Now me, her and her homegirls switching
So homegirls listen

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]
