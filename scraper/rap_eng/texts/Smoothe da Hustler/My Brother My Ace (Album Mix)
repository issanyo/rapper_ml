[Producer(s): D.R. Period]

[Hook: Smoothe Da Hustler and Trigger Tha Gambler]
You're my brother, right?  No doubt.  You’re getting down?  No doubt
Word?  Word to mother, Smoothe, I’m going all out
You're my brother, right?  No doubt.  You’re getting down?  No doubt
Word?  Word to mother, Trig, I’m going all out

[Verse 1: Smoothe Da Hustler and Trigger Tha Gambler]
What’d you
Think, nigga?  You're my blood, my motherfucking heart
We was doing it back-to-back from the start
It started from back-to-back, gat-to-gat.  Now it's
Track-to-track, so welcome.  All you herbs get done up
Run up with your gun up, all niggas get hung up
Jack, set position.  Black suitcase, black
Fatigue, strapped gun holster ready to
Toast ya and roast ya, leave you clapped, drop
Emcees like heart collapse so dead that while I drop
Degrees and show you motherfuckers where our heads’ at
We’re soft?  Who said that?  Cl-clack.  Underground anthem pledge rap
Fuck with Saratoga, get your head cracked
“Broken Language,” brother force some other force
Trigger Tha Gambler.  I’m my brother's keeper—that’s why I ain’t no double-cross
Fake, fronting faggots soft like fabric.  I got gadgets
My craft cause static.  Pussy niggas get dramatic
Dramatic, your nigga's pussy static cause craft.  My gadgets
Got a fabric like soft faggots.  Fronting fake if you’re backwards
Any crews that refuse rules and regulations
Get reincarnated in twos on sets.  Niggas, I’ll move with threats
Threats I’ll move with, bruise shit, mentally confuse
And lose shit.  Shit lose the confused.  Mentally, shit bruise
A crew slick.  Paralyzation cripple paramedics
I'll scheme on hospital checks—the drug money diabetic

[Hook: Smoothe Da Hustler and Trigger Tha Gambler]
You're my brother, right?  No doubt.  You’re getting down?  No doubt
Word?  Word to mother, Smoothe, I’m going all out
You're my brother, right?  No doubt.  You’re getting down?  No doubt
Word?  Word to mother, Trig, I’m going all out

[Verse 2: Smoothe Da Hustler and Trigger Tha Gambler]
God gave
Me a gift.  I’m giving him one back—that's a black
Bag with a ribbon sealed tight with a tag
A one-way shipment with no sight.  I’m giving
Spiritual dead flights, so, niggas, get your head right
And I was blessed with sinister schemes, managed to dream
Scientific chemist of drug mixed this for the team
The lacer place to place a eraser.  Trigger
Embrace a chaser, downtown courtroom judge-facer
For reporters, I caught her, brought her to the lab.  I told her
I knew a order to slaughter from borders across water
The gun way ‘cause, one day, it's all war.  Until then
Friday and Saturday’ll be my daughter's and my son day
T-S-R-M-I-O-G-O-
G-T-E-H-R-E.  Smoothe Da Hustler
Trigger, nigga.  It's the nigga Trig and Smoothe Da Hustler
Customer-serving drug smuggler smuggling drugs, serving customer
DR Period.  Period DR.  We are.  Are we?
No doubt.  Doubt no.  Y’all see, nigga.  Nigga see y’all

[Hook: Smoothe Da Hustler and Trigger Tha Gambler]
You're my brother, right?  No doubt.  You’re getting down?  No doubt
Word?  Word to mother, Smoothe, I’m going all out
You're my brother, right?  No doubt.  You’re getting down?  No doubt
Word?  Word to mother, Trig, I’m going all out
