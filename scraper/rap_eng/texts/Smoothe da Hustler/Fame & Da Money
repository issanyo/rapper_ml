[Verse 1: Da Punishers]

[Verse 2: Smoothe Da Hustler]

[Verse 3: Storm]
Now that I am dead, I preferred the bullet in my head
Or slit wrists, for now, I can get the job done nice and quick
It's messy when the blood spills, give one blast to the head
I have your brains oozing like spaghetti
Ahaahaa, you're messing with a black or parasite
Covered in blood joining forces is now where I'm at
I heard stories of bright lights and angels
People screaming, I see the disguise of a demon coming
I'm running to jump a hook in second
A net neck deep where my ankles they seem to meet
So you couldn't beat your case you took the easy way
Out suicide now you're chilling in hell by the fireplace
Walking head open on the horror Headless Horseman vent
By the way, I like the utensil around your neck
It's wet from blood, it's a suicide
From the root of all evil, you sold your soul, now you're my, oh, mine
That's what you did, welcome to hell, now it's too late
So come on in and don't forget to close hells gates!
