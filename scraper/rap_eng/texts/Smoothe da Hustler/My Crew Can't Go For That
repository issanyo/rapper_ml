[Hook: D.V. Alias Khrist]
My crew can't go for that, no-o
Uh huh, no can do
Now my crew can't go for that
Can't go for that, can't go for that
No can do!

[Verse 1: D.V. Alias Khrist and Trigger Tha Gambler]
[D.V. Alias Khrist]
Do you wanna take a ride through the hood?
The ruckus clique serious, up to no good
Can't go for no progress—it leads to stress
Mess when we step—you get your neck snapped
When a flow reacts on a next-level track
We heard your footsteps in a city where the sun don't shine
Rain affliction, laugh forever when it's the race upon the 9
Ruckus, so plan your mind and organize
[Trigger Tha Gambler]
I sit back in my bed.  Watch Bill and Ted
Make sure my days is excellent before my eyes get red
The professor teachin' rappers without the lecture
My texture move forty yards like rave tracks without the measure (measure)
My crew come better.  Better come with crews that's beef setters
Settin' beef, I'm known for bein' that rhyme deader you can't defeat (uhh)
Somethin' that was made to never die
I'm here for a reason—that's why God trust in I

[Hook: D.V. Alias Khrist] (x2)
My crew can't go for that, no-o
Uh huh, no can do
Now my crew can't go for that
Can't go for that, can't go for that
No can do!

[Verse 2: Smoothe Da Hustler and D.V. Alias Khrist]
[Smoothe Da Hustler]
If nobody told you, I'mma show you
Checkmate your king, overthrow you
You crown me king like checkers
Jump and blow you way out—stay out
My nights out'll put ya day out
I'm losin' it, confusin' it.  Next-level mentality to add on
Don't take away reality—I'm usin' it
But most don't agree with these tactics
They'll find MCs in the middle of four wars on they knees cause I freaked it backwards
Backwards how I freak it.  Peep it
My sanity helps me live it and speak it frequent
Slowly, I can capture criminal raptures
The master blowin' MC's with minimal batches of rappers
[D.V. Alias Khrist]
What be this malfunction?  Function
Cause the funk be hard to jump just like the junction
Clique policies
Don't y'all make slaves—get broken when they step up to these
Ya best to take heed

[Hook: D.V. Alias Khrist] (x2)
My crew can't go for that, no-o
Uh huh, no can do
Now my crew can't go for that
Can't go for that, can't go for that
No can do!

[Verse 3: Trigger Tha Gambler, D.V. Alias Khrist, and Smoothe Da Hustler]
[Trigger Tha Gambler]
With all love, due to the fact I jump funk on tracks
Get down for stacks.  My crew can't go for that
And to be exact, my gamblin' staff stay with a Mac
The pimp on wack 'head for attack, can't find no mat
[D.V. Alias Khrist]
Melody be in me, I see
Jump funking, funking we jumping, killing styles instantly
Die by the hitman for hire
Settin' wack crews on fire
Bow down to your lyrical, musical sire
DR P extraordinaire
Kick snares in your ear until your Jams be Def.  Who's left?
Cardiac arrest my chest like DTs to our raps, man
[Smoothe Da Hustler]
To bring it all to a close, close it all
Put that raw style in the game, froze it off
So it all'll boil down to this
Basically, facin' me, you're mistakingly ludicrous
I ain't new to this!

[Hook: D.V. Alias Khrist] (x3)
My crew can't go for that, no-o
Uh huh, no can do
Now my crew can't go for that
Can't go for that, can't go for that
No can do!
