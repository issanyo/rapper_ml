[Intro: Nine]
Man this world we live in
There's two to ways do everything
The right way and the wrong way
Thens there's the short way and the long way
But I'ma do my thing the Darc Mass way
I'm either gonna make it or I'ma take it

[Chorus: Smoothe Da Hustler]
I got to make something or I got to take something
Even if it comes down to hustling and pumping
I'ma do whatever to avoid the stormy weather
Got my act together either make or take

[Verse 1: Nine]
In the land of the free and the home of the brave
I still feel like a slave, my heart is dark like the bat cave
Don't cry, dry your eye
We all gon' die, but I'm gon' die fly
In the race the great paper chase
Money's the only thing that I'ma let you throw in my face
Corrupt political officials, speak the issues
And diss you, like used toilet tissue, I'ma miss you
When you fall into the flames it's the same games
With new names, and new gains
Same pains, and bloodstains propaganda
I want to smoke trees in a Havana, wearing a bandanna
At the Copacabana, swear to God I split a nigga like a banana
Over currencies or property ain't no stoppin' me
I'm building a monopoly now copy me
Each one teach one lessons of making and taking
Erasing, faking, and snaking, serious like a Jamaican
And I bring home the bacon daily, really
I never fake it, I got to make it, like it's sacred
Fuck around and I'ma take it

[Chorus: Smoothe Da Hustler] (x2)
I got to make something or I got to take something
Even if it comes down to hustling and pumping
I'ma do whatever to avoid the stormy weather
Got my act together either make or take

[Verse 2: Nine]
My hand raps around dollar bills sends chills
Down my spine like cheap wine, so I gotta get mine
All the time I rewind back to the days
When I realized sometimes crime pays
There's six million ways to die but only one to live
I need enough money to spend enough money to give
Cause I love my peeps and my peeps love me
And I refuse to see them living in poverty
I gotta be on point, I anoint myself savior with new flavor
Like Craig with my third eye I cried
Shed tears in the mind for being blind
Only thing left for me now is crime or rhyme

[Chorus: Smoothe Da Hustler] (x2)
I got to make something or I got to take something
Even if it comes down to hustling and pumping
I'ma do whatever to avoid the stormy weather
Got my act together either make or take

[Verse 3: Nine]
I refuse to lose similar to Chuck
Never bite the hand that feed you
Never bite the hand that buck, POW!
Now what! stuck in a maze with only one way out
Figure it out that's what life's about
Trail after trail, tribulation after tribulation
I want a black nation cause I'm sick of the plantation
No more picking cotton have you forgotten
We the kings and queens of this earth
Now roam in the rotten apple
Drinking Snapple, trying to get a little capital
Spend it like I'm crazy that's what rap will do
You got to maintain make sense out of what's insane
And stay on top of your game
Don't blame nobody but yourself for your lack of wealth
Times get hard get sneaky like a stealth
Make or take is the thesis
I want pieces of the pie gotta do or die

[Chorus: Smoothe Da Hustler] (x2)
I got to make something or I got to take something
Even if it comes down to hustling and pumping
I'ma do whatever to avoid the stormy weather
Got my act together either make or take
