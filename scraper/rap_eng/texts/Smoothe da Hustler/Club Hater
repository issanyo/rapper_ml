"I am an officer of the law, and uh by all rights I could uh.."
"Fuck off"
"You should watch your mouth little girl"
"AHHHHH"

[Hook]
We like to welcome you all to club hater
Where hustlers, bitches, and thugs they all hate ya
When players floss, they false and toss paper
Where your people are fake, and they might snake ya
We like to welcome you all to club hater
But we ain’t sweating it, our moves are major
Let’s get this party poppin’, let’s get them titties shaking
Make sure the shit we sayin’ keep the city hatin’

[Verse One: Diabolic]
Yeah, yeah, club hater, where thugs hate ya if you touch paper
Where y’all are bound to get stuck like we duct taped ya
Where cats who tuck razors are much safer
While I recline and find a dime to fuck later
Models clock watching the bottles you got poppin’
You not knockin’ to hustle bitch so stop plottin’
Start knob slobbing and get me off like John Cochran
‘Til some hater gets his jaw rawked for cock blockin’
It’s not stoppin’, sip 80 proof Grey Goose
‘Till I fall out like a baby tooth came loose
It may be true, we’ll take loops from crooks who kill ya
Real recognize real and you don’t look familiar
Takin’ shots of liquor, some vodka mixture
Late night, when snakes bite, and plot to hit ya
You got the picture, in the cut smoking a L
Ladies free all night, doors open at 12

[Chorus]
[Verse Two: Smoothe Da Hustler]
You’re the shit if you’re there, dipped in the ware, it’s tension here
Sniff the air, smell a stench in the gear
Bitch in your ear, her fist in your rear
Adjusting your vision to witness a slip in your gear and disappear
We bury men, hitting more licks than lesbians
Sleep, we give you more nightmares than Freddy
The shiest talkers, life talkers who strike offers
After the club, we home, run hoes, we night hawkers
We ice flossers, and dice tossers, we like corners
We club hop with drug blocks they ride for us
What you buggin’ for coming in the door, front and huggin’ the wall
Beefin’, why you think I carry the oven for?
Reaching to half bake one of y’all, some of y’all want it raw
You carry the battle, I’m tuggin’ the war
Come aboard, I’m comfy, try not bugging me
Guy’s died ugly for eye fucking me, he was cockeye ?

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Smoothe Da Hustler]
Look there ain’t no dress code, expect hoes to be dressed in less clothes
Hate growing like escrow
Heck no, you can’t get my John Hancock
I’m in the john, hand on my cock in a fan’s twat
Hustler’s creep, scheming on something to eat
‘Cause a customer leave with some hustler up the street
The flame from the snub laid him dead under the sheets
So the name of the club changes every couple of weeks

[Diabolic]
Trouble and beef, will scuffle ’til my knuckles are beat
I won’t stop ’til I knock out a bunch of your teeth
Surrounded by cut-throats, drowned in the Dutch smoke
Burning haze ’til every clown in the club choke
The top recruit, in hot pursuit if you’ve got the loot
With some prostitute in the bathroom knockin’ boots
Ready for war, cock and shoot, the same soldiers
Diabolic and Smoothe Da Hustler, the game’s over

[Hook]
