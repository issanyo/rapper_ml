[Snow]
It was a lonely, long, and grimey night
I go to see my girl, my Madonna
I've been so lonely, I've been thinkin' 'bout you

[Latoya & Miranda]
It never fails, no matter what I do
I find myself locked up in thoughts of you
Over your kiss, I reminisce by sweet sunlight
And it's your titanic touch, that takes my mind at night
'Cause when I'm with you love is so real it's like sweet pain
Just the thought of you takes away the rain
There's nothing I'd rather do than keep you on my mind
Days are short enough, so I don't waste my time
Locked up in you, your love is true, what am I to do?
Wanna make this real, 'bout how I feel, boy what's the deal?
Your love is so real, you got me, you got me

[Chorus]

[Snow]
Hey, way-yo-yeah
Think about you all the time you go away
Hey, know what you say
Spend a little time with me
Get freaky, be your fantasy
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride

[Smoothe]
Whoever wanna tangle better be ready to hang
I don't tie knots, why not? that ain't my thing (foo')
Catch me blazin' up in my whip, catchin' attitudes
When my flight's delayed, I flip, then I'm raisin' up
Pop the cork and, rearrange and stop your walkin'
The solo type with tigher game than dolomite
I got ya hopin' I stay around, I don't play around
When I rise, I lay it down, bless it and leave
I don't hang around, I'm too rude to be forgotten
You're feelin me right, boo?
That's what you get for stopin'

[Chorus]

[Latoya & Miranda]
In the middle of the night or broad daylight
Won't put up a fight
I'll just relax and let my thoughts take flight
While your honey rides control my world
Boy, my mind 24-7
What can I do?
You know you've got that butter love
I'm thinkin' of, baby you stay on my mind
I'm so 'bout you
Oh, I'm captivated, I can't maintain it
I just don't know what to do

[Chorus]
