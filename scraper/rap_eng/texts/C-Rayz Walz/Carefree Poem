[Intro: C-Rayz Walz]
Ayyo, I was writing this shit the other.  Right?  Y’all don’t even know what this shit...  Don’t fucking talk...

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
Does life breathe an elixir over blessing and the bothered at once
Whether you the [?] that makes the band or get punked.  What?
I held it down.  A lot of dumb shit to put up with
The topic is: Fuck That.  Matter of fact, fuck this
These ladies be off-the-chain, hook hinges in frame
We’re crazy.  Lost in lane, I’ll be the boss
Take blame.  Dead buzzards marked your soul as you worked
That pole.  Forget birth, earth.  You need self-worth
Control (Damn).  I was fucking those bitches, looking for more riches
Couldn’t tell them my face when my whole bank account was in stitches
Rolling an L in the crib, I start collecting the kid
Neglecting what is, I start reflecting again
Should I trust in friends who lust in sin?
Then send freakish gusts of wind that’ll scuff your Timbs?
Knock boost like the doors of the haunted house
Who knows what followed you out—like
What about that dude you think drugged you?  Stop by
For a drink.  Fifteen hours later, you’re just about to come to
You better prepare ‘cause what you asked for is
Dangerous like riding through Iraq with American passports
Breathe
