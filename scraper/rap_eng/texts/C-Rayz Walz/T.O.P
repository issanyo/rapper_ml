[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
Tropical topics and typos
Typical techniques transform, turn style to tightropes
In these terrible trials, truth is testament
The truth is these sound as tragedy’s testament
Tip-top shape like a truck in this tough city
A tug of war where your teeth’s tracking a tough titty
Train with talismans, triple threat tournaments
Tales of terror.  Tongues turn to tissue for talking shit
Train track tunnels the trail of Team Tortoise
Time out!  I’m taking a tag on the Taurus
Tricky tactics televised, but who the terrorist?
Trapped in my shell traveling like a terrapin

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
The other people, they oppose pigs
Stay on point.  They own pyramids
They only pioneers—that original posse
The Ovary Patrol taking over parties

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
Orphans of Odin, anonymous orchestra
Ovations from ogres in October
They say cajun’s out of order.  Options I offer:
Ownership of my octagon beams to signal orca
To come out the water.  Splashing, I’m open
Obviously soaking my opponent’s clothing
I originate with the drums for the okra
Brothers’ll owe ya—until you push the orchids, son, it’s over

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
The other people, they oppose pigs
Stay on point.  They own pyramids
They only pioneers—that original posse
The Ovary Patrol taking over parties

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
We pop shit, pop clips, pop crisp
Finger-pop your bitch to a pop hit
You prop-less, paranoid prophets
Press pockets, pyramids and projects
Potholes, paraphernalia, and product
It’s peculiar.  Poor people get picked
Pitbulls, penny gums, and piss in the elevator
Pray to get out this.  Perpetrators are the people
Police is pigs (Stop pouting!), the problems persist
The population doesn’t politic
You listen to demon crackers, probably a pile of shit
Caught between pistols and puberty
So pigs get popped like running backs in my community

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
The other people, they oppose pigs
Stay on point.  They own pyramids
They only pioneers—that original posse
The Ovary Patrol taking over parties
