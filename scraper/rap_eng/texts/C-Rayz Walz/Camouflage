[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
From 41 shots, we Dodge like Neons
Still smelling foul from the bullshit we be on
More than word—you heard the actions of speech
I seen a lot of things change like blacks with money
Cats say they pack heat but the boiler's broken
It's easy to be iced out when your mind's frozen
The proof is absolute truth.  We call it raw
It rains and most still go chasing waterfalls
Excited by the night life and the trife streets
I recall the pictures of Elijah staring at me
Now we hustle with the grim reaper in gym sneakers
Phlegm speakers.  When it comes to reefer, it's deeper
(We was young flowers!) surrounded by weeds
Camouflage feelings blend in with the trees
Before “Degrees,” I studied with the fiends in the park
And the fire from the crack pipe made the day dark
And it's still art!

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
You want wealth?  Search for self.  Find what you looking for
I got a Boogie Down mind with a Brooklyn jaw
My Queen’s life through your eyes—my sneakers is your size
To speak it through the rhyme sound better equalized
Burnt down buildings, pyramids, project piss
It's like life revolves around cliques, clips, and spliff
Chicks in whips.  Here's a tip: hollow ones'll split ya zipper
And the triggers get you stuck on the Island like Skipper
And the Gilligans'll kill again.  Blank spots?  Fill 'em in
Tank tops?  Metal men.  Train stops?  Adrenaline
Rush hour, change seats, the pain seeps
Run straight through every town like Main Street!
My brain keep the days of high-top fades, Gazelle shades
And MCs getting live on stage
Gym star, bar scars—act like you doing time
See through the fine lines ‘cause the mind's design as camouflage

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
Bulletproof gun-brellas for the rain in the TEC
Rubber-grip nines will test, split ya vest, kiss ya chest
For the hell of it, I live where life is irrelevant
Dead friends stay in my head like elephant.  Memory
(Necessary by any means!)  This too shall pass
Chalk outlines your body like a sick art class
Crack is eighteen years old.  So young but treacherous
The destruction of the hood is effortless—the error is
Mad kids be like “Yo.  Why she had me?”
“Ayyo, who daddy is?”  “This my other baby daddy”
What a fucking shame.  I'm drunk in the rain, ducking the pain
My soldiers sling.  I meditate with a migraine
You want my chain?  I hope you know white crane
Or get flamed left in a puddle of money.  Maintain
I want change—tired of drugs and rats, thugs and gats
There's still love for you, black—hip hop and rap
It's camouflage

Camouflage.  (C-Rayz Walz).  Stronghold on the prowl.  Camouflage.  Black Panther on the prowl.  Camouflage.  Big god on the boards.  (You don’t see it).  “Days easy”—say it proud.  Yo, camouflage.  Hearing it in the lounge.  (You don’t see it).  It’s going down.  It’s camouflage
