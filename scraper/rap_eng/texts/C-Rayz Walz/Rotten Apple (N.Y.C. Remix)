L.I.F.E. Long & Bunty Beats ft. C-Rayz Walz - “Rotten Apple (N.Y.C. Remix)”
[Emcee(s): L.I.F.E. Long and C-Rayz Walz]
[Producer(s): Bunty Beats]
[Scratches: Bunty Beats]

[Verse 1: L.I.F.E. Long]
Fresh out the Hudson, it’s the Queens and Bronx brethren
Residing out in Brooknam, we got cousins out in Shaolin
In a circle from Strong Island, Decepticons combining
Lo-Lives up in the Polo Mansion wiling, Gazelles and
Kangols [?] styling.  Feel the strength
Of the city.  Ayyo, we’re more than just an island

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
(C-Rayz) True to class (BX) ‘cause the truth is multiplying
Do the math on the path in blood diamonds, turn-
Turnstyles (Trash), Chuck-Chuckers, bubblegoose
Loosies, crackheads, boxcutters, hustle-proof
[?] spot hot, poppy got butter
Pot brothers with baby mothers
Brothers snitching, (Muah) Kiss my ass
Jada still spit heroine lines
Sniff N.Y.C. veteran rhymes
Stronghold sign up in the sky, see?

"I'm coming straight out the N.Y.C." - Sample from Big L - "M.V.P."
“And you say” - Sample from [?] - “[?]”
[C-Rayz Walz and L.I.F.E. Long]
And you say, “New York City”
[Samples with Scratches by Bunty Beats]
“And clown rappers I'm bound to slay" - Sample from Big L - "M.V.P."
"See how I kill it with my New York spit" - Sample from Busta Rhymes on Busta Rhymes ft. Swizz Beatz - "New York Shit"

[Verse 3: L.I.F.E. Long]
New York, New York notorious for dreams seen
Camouflage regime on the paper chase (Money) for the money (Money)
(Green) Sever your thoughts, get caught with the infrared
Beams—bloodspots on foreheads from the red dots
Aiming, marking my position from the Rotten Apple’s
Heart: Jamaica, Queens.  Rock out my socks, feel
The vibe transmitted from speakers out parks, or hear the
BX (The BX.  Kool Herc first sparked)
The flame spread, burning up the Five Boroughs
Q-U, Brooknam, Shaolin, L.I., L.E.-
-S. to Y-O.  The streets of New York scored by Kool G
Rap & DJ Polo.  Watch your back from sheisty po-po
Stop-and-frisking pigs in blue wearing badges
Quick to cap a couple of cabbages.  Murals cover
Walls of those slain by savages.  Graffiti, wild starving
Artists using trains as canvas from [?] to Barclay

[Verse 4: C-Rayz Walz]
That’s word, L.I.F.E.  Walz got a shifty tongue
Quick to turn a sixteen to a sixty-one
“Area 51.  Get your guns, get your
Money up.  Life ain’t over—this ain’t fun”
This is Pun, Biggie, and Pac headquarters
[?] Big L [?] on the block.  I brought
Queens to the Bronx, gave ‘em Harlem cock.  The
Brooklyn bulge is a hot Glock crotch pop
Shaolin on the rocks.  "Booyaka, booyaka
Booyaka, booyaka.”  That’s a Flatbush shot
On British Knights, I’m uptown, rushing a mic
With Stan Smiths, handcuffing your ice
“Camouflage” slacks, Black Panther the tracks
My Technique’s Immortal—how Revolutionary is that?
‘Til the end, I speak about the phlegm I be
I’m a worm, still grimy, still slimy
