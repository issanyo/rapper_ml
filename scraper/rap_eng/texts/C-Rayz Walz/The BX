[Intro: Sample Quote from [?]]
[?]
Why don’t I trust my partner, Ray?
[?]
Why?  In this business, you can never trust anybody.  Everybody in this business is a criminal.  How are you gonna trust someone?

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
Yo, y’all ain’t ready for combat.  Where’s The Bronx at?
Right next to Brooklyn and Manhattan—check the train map
Fuck a setback.  I waited my life to rep that
What y’all first spit, son?  The abyss where I’m from
People kill for money—the streets is running red
Thinking you can stop a dummy makes you a tissue head
Blocks just long enough to make cops lose a Rockport
My brain in a lobby, thinking heavily of brick rock porch
Ricochets bomb battles with bullets and pop tops off
Cork New York from Newports to new thoughts
Go back in time like book bag chimes
And see my dominant dialogue on the D line
And you won’t see Shyne this year like Puffy
So you come through my Camp Product Roughly
Surrounded by Porto Rocs and plotting jabs
Guns start cocking back—you could get runs in your stocking caps
Still rocking crack since ‘83
The Boogie—ooh—yes, y’all, (Ooh ooh) in the place to be
Off the bridge, the home of The Pinstripe
To house my pen strikes, the first spot to bend mics
A Cedar Park night will begin like, “One, two”
To leave your skin tight—chumps couldn’t come through
Nothing personal.  Just The BX dress rehearsal
25 to life is like curfew
To keep it right in hindsight, it’s about flows
But that BX bullshit, we on it like Gauchos

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
I figure that getting beat up for yelling, “River rat”
Wouldn’t happen if you was living in the area, black
Too many touch mics, repping The Bronx like, “Sike!”
Street life’s hype—you could get sniped for nice stripes
Nothing to it.  They’ll just do it.  No remorse
The foolish run wild like fluid through the living corpse
If you lost hard rocks of salt, the herbs would murder you
Push your top back like brain rack convertibles
We pop shotties, sip Scotch at block parties
BDP or not, feel La Rock like Scott, see?
B-boys dance at the jux at 2:40
A twenty sack with two dime shorties (Yeah)
I rhyme naughty—by nature, I’m treacherous
The hectic shit is I’ll make you feel it by sketching it
Little kids hustle and scuffle like scarred veterans
Rob you off the muscle for your car Edison
Hand skills sick—some needed palm medicine
[Evil laughs who ate a wall left?] no evidence
Never sleep on the power of a question
Or the force of the answer when you ask me where I’m repping
You don’t get the point?  My Puerto Ricans will start stabbing you
Close to tracks like rats on Park Avenue
Skullies, du-rags, [?], fatigues
You know the steez—give me those or taste some of these
I’m Cardiño Reyes—the whole hood love me
Plus I’m God—I don’t like ugly.  What, B?

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
Once in a blue like the carnival.  The death rates alarming who?
Rest in peace to the most honorable
Doug Ice, Dollar Bill Phil, True too and [?]
BO, Big Pun.  Come on, too many friends
My spirit lifts like Jessica Smith as I sit
In a cloud, taking a piss on this stupid shit
My flashbacks will cripple y’all like dangerous car accidents
Amongst Wiffle ball practicing
I’m Larry Davis released out the beast, on the streets
Armed with the pen and too much sheets of loose leaf
Beef what?  Creep up, you’ll catch the right hook
And get beat up.  And have teeth lunch
Police rush the floor with a petrol force
The smart thugs ran quick like Metro North
Riverdale, Kingsbridge, Fordham Road, Tremont
Morrisania mind haven by the weed spot
The hub where everybody use or sell drugs
Mix or dub, life or death, icepicks or slugs
It seems so small.  Now that I’m old, I prove
I’m too big to do laps in Crotona Pool
And a school like ‘58 was dope like ‘85
Years before baby Islams had the baby 9s
So I rep this like Dave Winfield ‘til my skin peels
‘Cause I’m an ash pump or a plump maggot meal
From the Boys’ Club to the [Brooklyn?], yo
I’m from The Bronx.  Don’t stare, but keep looking, yo
