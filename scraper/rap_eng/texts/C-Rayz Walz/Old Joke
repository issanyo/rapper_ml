[Intro: C-Rayz Walz]
Hahaha.  (What’d you say?).  I’m the old joke

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
I’m the old joke.  Became rich because I was so broke
Watched the young seeds turn into old folk
I died almost, but we all came so close
Now laugh at the old joke

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
I used to rock windbreakers—now it’s fat leathers
I got money now (So?)—I’m still a ass-bettor
Everything I wanted, I stole like a lowlife
Rocked crowds of ten-thousand with no mic
I don’t live in the project.  No writ, no lights
So don’t step on that cigarette, aight?
The old joke.  Warm toast—the gat’s in the couch
Crib so small, you walk in and fall back out
Like wack MCs, always wanna be nice
Dumb like going to the sixth floor pressing three twice
Knock your patch off—my rap like Lee’s and get your teeth cracked
Believe me, Mikey wouldn’t even eat that
Ain’t your momma gritty?  Who pops corns with 9 millies?
Mighty fine, [?] snuff, break his time
I’ll choke you and ask, “Did I do that?” like Urkel
With three legs, walking in a circle

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
I’m the old joke.  Became rich because I was so broke
Watched the young seeds turn into old folk
I died almost, but we all came so close
Now laugh at the old joke

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
Twelve eggs at a tennis match playing the dozens
You ain’t hard-boiled—your weak shell could be crushed in
(And we dissed you).  “Everybody’s tough now.”  Look into this dumb fact
A fun snack will lead to a gun clap
While I get love like Barney, my haze is purple
Your moms is my dog—I Walker like Herschel
You see, son, when the quarter back was a refund
Everyone bit moves from Rerun
Hot peas in butter.  Police seize motherfuckers in covers
But I’m hip to the game like the ruckus, suckers
My pops is a old man with a wooden leg and a kickstand
(Laugh) Laugh—that’s that shit, fams
Rappers had the gall, but that’s not all
I’ll make a shoot a dead rocket, play casketball
(Yo, speak English!).  My words is a math test
And your chick sticks ice in the drawers to keep the crabs fresh

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
I’m the old joke.  Became rich because I was so broke
Watched the young seeds turn into old folk
I died almost, but we all came so close
Now laugh at the old joke

[Bridge: C-Rayz Walz with DJ JS-1 Scratches]
I’m the old joke

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
Timeless definers wisest, livest
Mine of highness to realize an idea of brightness
And react with the impact of life’s excitement
To make you laugh while I’m seriously frightened
Taking time to show respect to punchlines
The lunchroom tables, the blocks at summertime
Brothers cried.  Some got punched in the eye
Some was like “Fuck that.  You got it,” and paid it no mind
Back in days, kids that can’t snap
They probably the same motherfuckers on stage now that can’t rap
And I can’t like it’s OK ‘cause it’s not
True school like “Me and you, three o’clock.”  Watch!
All you could front, smoke, or pop 9 shots
Used to hump joke and climb rocks
So I stopped to gaze at a page of forgotten days
Last one to cop my album is a fried, rotten egg

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
I’m the old joke.  Became rich because I was so broke
Watched the young seeds turn into old folk
I died almost, but we all came so close
Now laugh at the old joke

[Bridge: C-Rayz Walz with DJ JS-1 Scratches]
I’m the old joke

[Outro: C-Rayz Walz]
Probably got a sling durag.  Hahaha.  Corduroy bra.  Laugh at that
