[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
By the light of the silvery, you'll be dead like chivalry
If you don't watch your back while making that delivery
Cause the cat with the fiddle got a band of thieves
And if he run up in your spot, you should plan to leave
Yo, the cow got jumped and stabbed in the udder
Lost two quarts of milk and they grabbed the butter
They bagged it up and brought it all to me that night
And the little dog laugh just to see that sight
He was amused by the fact that these dudes paying dues
But if you don't follow my rules you gonna lose
The dish and the spoon got till the end of June
To pay me what they owe me or they gonna meet they doom
Who am I
I be the man in the moon and when I walk in
Everybody stand in the room
Got dough? Be careful when you pull some out
Cause it gets wild and dangerous when the wolves come out YUP

[Verse 2: MC Paul Barman]
NOPE tearful child's a stranger's kid, full moon's out
Snout in air, shoutin' despair, 'Big Whack' mushroom cloud
Deep impact crater now keep you intact
In fact, stabler later I said. peep how
Moon's a person, new to family, anomaly to universe
You grew up first
Who knows why La Luna works
It's equilibrium, unique will will be done
Four people, still be one with plant and tree
Family built it tilt to the sun
Hole up! know what, get in the Torus
For a field trip, real quick, mom and son both heal rips
Roll up to the Metaphorist
Doughnut picnic set before us
Felix, orb is ellipse
Glowin, shinin', setting behind old pine
Wet wing dryin' from a rosevine clothes line
Let's seek a lost tree-mosque kiosk hollow
Go climb! I'll follow

[Verse 3: Del the Funkee Homosapien]
Showtime at the Apollo
In 1969, to Buzz, I was the model
Dry and cold yet you studied my surface
But it's worthless
My atmosphere is not the same as Earth's is
First get it right
I'm not a star, I'm a satellite
Ain't no atmosphere, you wouldn't last a night
Ain't no rappers here, you got sacrificed
And you can't hide cause it's dark in the day time
Two hundred thirty-eight thousand nine hundred
Miles from Earth so you can just try to come get
Me from the lunar perigee
But the apogee is gonna be more than a few laps from me
The axis be
Approximately twenty seven
Days and about eight hours so start steppin'
No matter where you go, I'mma face you
I got you on my clock, you can't escape foo'
I'm the moon
La Luna
Glowing, shining
La Luna
Glowing, shining

[Verse 4: C-Rayz Walz]
Maan (Dutch for Moon)

Maan you're Full of it
You can't make me do shit
I control my emotions
Where The Wild Things Live
Centrifugal forces
I take what you give
You shape when I shift
This is how it happens
When I'm out
My whereabouts are near and far
Cats act funny till I B Sirius
Like a Dogon Star
A nightlight for the jungle where it's pumas riftin'
Look at my clock non stop rock, lunarticken
In the LapTop of Luxury...smash an outtaspace bar
Turn the slugs to Silver Dollar pancakes, I ate ya'll
You would probably think of me as something slashin'
Running through the woods with a name like Sebastian
The orb is just a nightlight for the bats and the owls
Who shine like nickel plated gats, clapped in the crowds
If I don't flood your pad now
I'll get you player
When it's dark out
I'll still shine
28 Days Later
I coincide with the tides and the currents
So in the middle of the harvest, it's no surprise I flourish
Used to live in the Earth
Till the mad scientist burst
But that's a small thing to bling for the giants who cursed
Some even accuse me of moonlighting as the sandman
I felt the Earth pull thru/ for a one NightStand
That's when I realized it was June
And I lay naked, howling at.......

[Singing]
The bright moon is the shepherdess

[Sample]
The Ancients clearly believed that the moon was a gate for soul. They viewed the moon as the home for the dead. (?)
