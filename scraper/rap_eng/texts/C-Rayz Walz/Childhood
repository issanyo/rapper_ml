[Verse 1: Kosha Dillz]
I was a real hothead out the twin-sized bed
Mom woke me up.  Melted cheese, egg on Jewish challah bread
Sixth grade, getting paid into duels proper
Hustled five crackers at my middle school locker
Piggybank grow fat like Diddy bankroll
[?] and jaws that can’t blow
Self done changed.  Fascinated by the game, I bugged out
They raised twenty-five cent prices for my video games
Mortal Kombat.  Time for no contract
Back to the Future—no one told McFly, but where my moms at?
[?], face shining
Drug-addicted, no label would sign me
We grew up three sons.  I was the youngest
Most talented, dumbest, stuffed my face
With garlic peanut hummus.  The hardest lesson learned
While my varsity sports team that never succeeded

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz and (Kosha Dillz)]
My rhymes ain’t good?  My rhymes misunderstood?
(Pardon me again, dog), ‘cause that’s my childhood
(We grew up playing, running bases)
Ten years later, I was on the streets, running with baseheads
My rhymes ain’t good?  My rhymes misunderstood?
(Pardon me again, dog), ‘cause that’s my childhood
(Always kept my mouth shut), thought I was about bucks
(My pops put the house up).  He said:

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
Scruff-faced for life, enveloped cheap talk out the side of his mouth
Due to the [science, god pressed it?] but had the appetite for extra cheese
No justice.  Just iced and freezing
Solidifying steeze at thirty-two degrees
Past twenty-five and black?  You a funny guy
And rap will get you clapped like crack money stacks
High in the lab.  How can you relate to, uh, soon as this drop, yo
I will stop eating tuna fish and tacos, waffles and falafels
Is there more in store in the floors and storage?
Serial numbers all scratched off the porridge
Super-Bowl-smashed your helmet after good hits
I’m a ghetto lighter.  If I’m losing you, I’ll show you hood flicks
I could be raking the dough, but I’m leaving where it falls
My concentration’s on flow and that’s war, that’s raw
Black pain stain my face, drape like tatted tears.  I
Rough the beat up in revenge of my battle here to see justice

[Hook (Overlapped with Matisyahu Adlibs): C-Rayz Walz and (Kosha Dillz)]

[Verse 3: Matisyahu]
Used to be me in my room with no DJ, eh
Just a PA and a pair of JBL speakers
In the attic of my parents’ house.  Not a mouse was heard
1 PM in the afternoon, trying to
Suck some resin from the pipe before pops gets home
Put my lips to the mic when the king got
His power from a ground amplifier, no
Earplugs and I’d beatbox in the shower for song
We reverberation, just trying to make it back from a long vacation
Still trying to find my way home, but, all along, I knew
I was never alone.  No, you’re never alone
Smoking all that weed’ll make a man-a jump sound, stereo
We used to mix our Frosted Flakes with Cheerios
LSD, Ecstasy, slice through reality
Only seventeen, trying to find my queen
I never developed a center, so my heart’s empty
Sleeping in the rain just to feel something
Young bucks never think that they’ll damage their brain
I was roaming through your world, looking for some milk and honey
And still am.  Some think that life is just funny and some
Just stare at the Sun ‘til they can’t see me
I’ll stick to my guns and do what we’ve always done
Whether burned in the oven or lost at sea completely

Yeah.  C-Rayz, Kosher Dillz, Matisyahu.  [?]
