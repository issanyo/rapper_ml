VERSE 1
STR8 TAKING MINE
NOTHIN ON THE LO WHEN I VIC
MY MINDS A PATCHWORK QUILT W/ A GLOW & A GLITCH
& I'LL SHOW YOU THE REAL
CUZ YALL GOOD WITH THE FAKE
I AM WHO YALL AIN'T KNOW THE GAME WOULD CREATE
WHILE YOU TAKIN THE PISS ON THE WHOLE PRESENTATION AS PROOF
I GOT A MERMAID PLAYING THE FLUTE
BLASTIN A BEAT
POPPIN A BOTTLE
BOSS BOUNCE ON A BITCH
I WANNA BUBBLE
BUY A HOUSE ON A CLIFF
THIS IS IT
I'M ANNOUNCING MY ROSTER
A BUNCH OF TUFF PLAYERS WITH STRENGTHWHO HAD ENOUGH OF THE BENCH IN THE PARK
I GET PENSIVE LIKE A PIT
THEN BARKS IS THE BYTES & IT'S ON
MY DOGS GO TO ALL HEAVEN IN LIFE WRITING A SONG
SO MY TREE IS A LEAVE AND I SEW WHAT IT SEEMS
& I SEE-SAW AS MORE THAN A MOVIE I LIKE
THAT'S RIGHT
LIFE'S UP AND DOWN IN MY EYES
MORE LIKE HELLO!
MY CD'S A GOOD BYE
AND THAT'S.......

(HOOK)
HIP-HOP
I PUT MY SOUL IN THIS SHIT
HEADED FOR THE TOP
LET IT POP
HOLDIN THE 5TH
STOP LIVING
KEEP BEING A SNITCH
TELL ON YASELF
SOON THERE'LL BE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PUT YOU IN CELLS
THEN YOU A COULD BE A RINGTONE
SHINE WHEN I RHYME
SHOW YOU HOW TO BLING HOMES
DIVINE IN THE MIND
ROYAL BLOODLINE
LISTEN TO THE KINGS PEOM
LONE LION I ROAM
THE UNIVERSE IS MY PRIDE

VERSE 2
I TRY TO STUFF IT ALL INTO A VERSE LIKE DUFFLE
THE HUSTLE, THE STRUGGLE
THE SOUND MUFFLE WHEN HATERS TELL ME I LOVE YOU
IT'S ILL LIKE REASONS TO VISIT HOSPITALS STILL
THE UNSTOPPABLE WILL TO MOVE OBSTACLES BUILD MY CHARACHTER TILL
DEFEAT AINT A OPTION IN THE OPTICAL DEAL
SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?
THE VICTORY'S REAL
I'M ME WHEN I'M PLAYING
BE GENTLE WITH THAT
THAT'S A REAL FUKIN BAT
YOU TAKE A SWING AT THE KID
YOU BETTER BRING A HIT BACK
YOU WANNA HAVE A CRACK AT IT
I KNOW CRACK ADDICTS WHO RAP
CRAFTMATIC HABITS CLAP YOU TO NAPS
SNATCHED ICE OFF THE BLOCK
ROCKED BIDS & DROPPED RAPPS
ON THE ROAD TO THE RICHES
POPPED RATCHETS AND RIPPED PROFALACS
ALMOST EARTHED A KID THROWING A FIT
CAUGHT THAT?
ON TAPE I'M A MENACE TO SOCIETY CLIP
BROUGHT BACK
MY SUN WATCHIN SOUTH PARK
WHILE I'M STEAMIN A SPLIFF
SPEAKIN THE TRUTH WHILE I'M PLEADING THE 5TH
OR AM I JUST
