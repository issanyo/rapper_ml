[Chorus]:
The art of energy starts the chemistry
Soon as the dark sparks I light up the dark vicinity
And I'm down to get it started till they finish me
The art of energy sparks the symmetry
In tune with the charged parts
I guarantee dark sharks will mimic me
Down to get it started till they finish me
The art of energy walks to the imagery
The chemistry starts, sharp in the dark
And the vision speaks sparks
Down to get it started till they finish me

[Verse One]:
Manic maniac
Mic mechanic makin' marches with a musical message on Myspace
I'm a Monster
I've been spazzin', back flash the Last Dragon action
When you love hip hop, it just happens
It's no accident
I stay sharp in the cut like what!
I put an axe in it
My dialogue's black
Change your perception like accident
Your act's rented
You paid to come out, rap for a minute
Get gassed and go back in it
A spark of symmetry starts the chemistry charts
Darts flood vicinity part, my imagery's smart
So I Pop off
Like today, low Ravi
And pop up, like, "Surprise everybody!"
It ain't about musical buyers on some lame shit
It'll crack before them vain motherfucker you came with
The grey vision
To prove my point, escape livin'
And y'all love the men who hate women
Listen

[Chorus]:
The art of energy starts the chemistry
Soon as the dark sparks I light up the dark vicinity
And I'm down to get it started till they finish me
The art of energy sparks the symmetry
In tune with the charged parts
I guarantee dark sharks will mimic me
Down to get it started till they finish me
The art of energy walks to the imagery
The chemistry starts, sharp in the dark
And the vision speaks sparks
Down to get it started till they finish me

[Verse Two]:
Mentally I pack chips and make Pentium's weak
Plenty of streets bump Jeeps with Millennia beats
Y'all ain't ready for the bird and the reppin' god
I got cake now off my food stamp repertoire
Repetroooooois
Yeah, without menage e
The beast don't speak, he spits and leaves lava
Ahhhh
And the wonders we share, wholeness appear
And I'm still hot, in my coldest year
I connect with the raw people
The core people
I'll be here when there are no more people
Low income housin', certainly section 8
Sons get killed, mercury is in retrograde
The Revelation of Genesis, the good is the bad
If you love life, death won't make you sad
On the low
I'm so close to the most higher
You a poster
I'm supposed to inspire the flier

[Chorus]:
The art of energy starts the chemistry
Soon as the dark sparks I light up the dark vicinity
And I'm down to get it started till they finish me
The art of energy sparks the symmetry
In tune with the charged parts
I guarantee dark sharks will mimic me
Down to get it started till they finish me
The art of energy marks the imagery
The chemistry starts, sharp in the dark
And the vision speaks sparks
Down to get it started till they finish me

[Verse Three]:
I ain't a hustler homie
I'm a struggler Joey
Plus I'm champ like Brody
If you camp you know me
Ultraviolet, mega hype and heightened
Hyphened them myself, we connect when divided
Mighty psyche get checks, cash 'em later
As for trees, I blew grass like Hugh Masekela
The streets is cruddy
Filled with crocodiles
Cops will cop a smile
Cock Glocks and pop a child
I used to be the kid
That would pop my gun off
Now I'm the man, I stopped those plans to drop my son off
The pain claps, what goes around is sent back
My syntax, starts to Wild Rumpus like Sendak
Nature boy, high off the world
Don't say "peace" to me, if you lie to your girl
Voice your choice
Victor or victim
My man went crazy, got mad I ain't go there with him
Damn
That's the power of the mind dawg?
Fam
That's my strength you better find yours
Ali ?, cross the bridge and burnin' it
Practice make perfect, perfect practice makes permanent
Get my groove on
Rip you like a coupon
A lot MC's look good
To poop on!

[Chorus]:
The art of energy starts the chemistry
Soon as the dark sparks I light up the dark vicinity
And I'm down to get it started till they finish me
The art of energy sparks the symmetry
In tune with the charged parts
I guarantee dark sharks will mimic me
Down to get it started till they finish me
The art of energy marks the imagery
The chemistry starts, sharp in the dark
And the vision speaks sparks
Down to get it started till they finish me
