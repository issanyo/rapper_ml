[Intro: C-Rayz Walz]
Yeah!   (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
I got flavor like Adobo.  You ain't know though?
My rap go back like Quack Dilly Oso
Señorita, señorita.  Teacher!
What you gon' teach us except to be weaker?
You go bo-bo?  I go BO-BO-BO!
BO-BO!  Like Jamaicans at a gun show
Where you from, loc?  Acting tough like gun ho
Pull the gun like bums now—come out your clothes, yo
What you think the flow is fo’?
So you can fall when I throw blows
C-Rayz.  You ain't know I'm a pro?
My style’s rough canvas, arithemetic
Flipping the script.  Now your chick want a sip of the tip
Tell her, “Chill.  I'm celibate, kid”
Remember my name like the elephants did
Shake the place 'til I break your face
Or you can catch a DDT like Jake “The Snake”
Come on!

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz and (Natural K.A.W.S.)]
If you love it, say, “Yeah!”  (Yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
If you need it, say, “Yeah!”  (Yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
If you got it, say, “Yeah!”  (Yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
If you want it, say, “Yeah!”  (Yeah!)

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
Live from New York like Saturday Night
In the bing with a mic.  I bling when I write—yeah!
In a battle, better come equipped
No L's—I win by landslides and forfeits (Okay)
Got the "California Love" like Pac
Malik on a track?  I can't be stopped
I was once told by a wise MC
“Think before you spit on the M-I-C”
Repping NYC 'til I D-I-E
You can't S-double-E-E-E M-C
Getting "Spellbound" like K-Solo
'Bout to go loco from breaking backs like bolo
I know you say, “He got the ill flow, though”
As I Jam with my Jimmy like the Wolves in Minnesoto
Looking good in the photo, but make this clear
When I spit, throw your hands in the air and

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz and (Natural K.A.W.S.)]
If you love it, say, “Yeah!”  (Yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
If you need it, say, “Yeah!”  (Yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
If you got it, say, “Yeah!”  (Yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
If you want it, say, “Yeah!”  (Yeah!)

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
Uh, I write lines hype like fight time—killing it!
Plug this beat in your lifeline—f-feeling it?
Stain your brain with the flame—sp-spilling, kid
Bump this junk in your trunk—four-wheeling it
Rock like stones and bricks and pebbles
Hot like chrome that spit the devil
Chase the bass, fix the levels
Case the place, Vick your bezels
Free incoming like Nextel
I see men dumbing but sex sells
Life is ill and trifling—still, I fight for meals
In this lifetime, rhyme for real
Signed and sealed.  Time to peel
Yo son, I shined before I signed the deal (What?)
Make this clear.  I’mma take this year
Don't just stand there.  Throw your hands in the air and

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz and (Natural K.A.W.S.)]
If you love it, say, “Yeah!”  (Yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
If you need it, say, “Yeah!”  (Yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
If you got it, say, “Yeah!”  (Yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
If you want it, say, “Yeah!”  (Yeah!)

[Bridge: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
You wanna see daddy be a clown when he come around?
Be a clown now.  Bow, blao, blao, blao!

[Outro: C-Rayz Walz]
Yeah!  Oh.  Aight, I’ll give it to you.  Yo, what year is this?  Malik Allah.  Shoutouts to the Breastmilk Fam.  The secret weapon.  (If you love it, say, “Yeah!”).  Malik on the track.  (If you need it, say, “Yeah!”).  Yeaaaah!  (If you got it, say, “Yeah!”).  Yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  C-Rayz, C-Rayz, C-Rayz.  (If you want it, say, “Yeah!”).  Malik
