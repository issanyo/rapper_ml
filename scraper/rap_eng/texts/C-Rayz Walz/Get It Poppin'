[Intro: C-Rayz Walz with DJ JS-1 Scratches]
Hip hop.  Dub-L

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz with DJ JS-1 Scratches]
Hip hopping (Come on), show stopping (Come on), body rocking
Ayyo, let’s get it popping (Come on)
Flow’s rocking (Come on).  It’s no option
Get up off the wall.  Come on.  Start popping

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
My whole doctrine is my show popping
With my foes watching, holding my Johnny Cochran
(Yo, you know what?).  Hell no.  I never met him
Your dogs don’t bite—they bark but let me pet ‘em
Now let me wet ‘em with the flow, correct that “Ayyo”
Connect that fatal blow that make the crowd say “Ho!”
Screaming for gardening tools, rake in the dough
With the whole world watching my back like J Lo
I’m real like the rent you paying and since you staying
I’mma kill it with the instrumental playing
Ghetto fab on the D Train with yellow pad
Jotting down lines hard to catch like yellow cabs
Mellow mad, hyperactively sad, bipolar
High solar energy—ask my dad
Hard rocks front knowing they was pebbles once
Blasting guns at garbage cans—they be popping, jump

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz with DJ JS-1 Scratches]
Hip hopping (Come on), show stopping (Come on), body rocking
Ayyo, let’s get it popping (Come on)
Flow’s rocking (Come on).  It’s no option
Get up off the wall.  Come on.  Start popping
Hip hopping (Come on), show stopping (Come on), body rocking
Ayyo, let’s get it popping (Come on)
Flow’s rocking (Come on).  It’s no option
Get up off the wall.  Come on.  Start walking

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
Yo, hit me on a three-way before ShowTime
MCs hung out to dry get clotheslined
I got guns on fire—I’m a hot shot
Wrap my fist in tissue, bust ya snotbox
I’m a quiet, shy kid who incites riot
Took my styles to fat farm and went on a diet
Don’t be scared.  Be very afraid
Before I chop your face off with a rusty, ruckus blade
Bubble like hippo snot.  On point like rhino horns
Dropping hot wax (“Get slapped!”)—the vinyl’s warm
I jam sick like Shaq with the flu
What would you do?  Get blazed or start a barbecue?
I’m a patient kid that don’t use big words
Consider me a waiter, player—you will get served
If I holler at you, I’ll get arrested for my vocals
And you probably think I write rhymes, don’t you?

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz with DJ JS-1 Scratches]
Hip hopping (Come on), show stopping (Come on), body rocking
Ayyo, let’s get it popping (Come on)
Flow’s rocking (Come on).  It’s no option
Get up off the wall.  Come on.  Start walking
Hip hopping (Come on), show stopping (Come on), body rocking
Ayyo, let’s get it popping (Come on)
Flow’s rocking (Come on).  It’s no option
Get up off the wall.  Come on.  Start bopping

[Bridge: C-Rayz Walz with DJ JS-1 Scratches]
Hip hopping.  Get hip hopping (Come on)
Hip hopping.  Get it popping (Come on)

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
I’m Tai Chi, Tae Bo, Tae Kwon Do
Thai stick, chocolate, on some lit hydro
My style’s mad cow—beef, you dead, man
Screaming on you (Sissies) like X Clan
Y’all deserve a eye scuff for trash talk (Go ‘head)
Push you wig with you face smashed in the dashboard
And it’s asphalt—y’all bitch made cats don’t drop shit!
Like Somalians with oxygen in they stomach
When I defecate, go investigate my shit
And see the corns I ate last time I spit
Rip jims in blue star format.  You hot?
(No you not).  I’ll turn your grill into a North Face doormat
Let’s get it popping!  It’s on and I ain’t stopping
I’m here to fuck the game up like Dennis Rodman
And I’m the “Old Joke,” but this is serious
(See, clown).  Let’s get up.  I’ll catch you on the rebound (Blao)

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz with DJ JS-1 Scratches]
Hip hopping (Come on), show stopping (Come on), body rocking
Ayyo, let’s get it popping (Come on)
Flow’s rocking (Come on).  It’s no option
Get up off the wall.  Come on.  Start walking
Hip hopping (Come on), show stopping (Come on), body rocking
Ayyo, let’s get it popping (Come on)
Flow’s rocking (Come on).  It’s no option
Get up off the wall.  Come on.  Start popping

[Outro: C-Rayz Walz with DJ JS-1 Scratches]
Hip hopping (Get it popping).  JS-1
Hip hopping (Get it popping).  C-Rayz Walz
Hip hopping (Get it popping).  Dub-L (Come on, come on)
Get it popping (Start dropping).  Stronghold
Get it popping
Popping
Hip hopping
