[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
The greenhouse effect, melanin, soil weapons
Canaanite space cadet tryna intercept the interpret
Scientific realms of my in-depth intellect
[?], Tibet, Maya, Inca, Aztec
Niggas is set tryna cut me up like Osiris
Look into my iris, infect me with the Dehli virus
Spiritual sinus clog your third one—third eye
Escape the apocalypse in the surburban
You grew used to the conversations of Lucifer
Evil [?], whisperers, and inducers
Lyrics make lungs collapse.  Use tongues for gats
Where I’m coming to, there’s no coming back
The final serve—my flow strikes your vital nerve
I speak wisdom, tidal-wave my words
You say, “Word?”  Well that ain’t what you heard
Sin time!  Divine witch’s brew’s been stirred
I’m adjacent to Satan in the basement
Chaos and confrontation, deep concentration
Reverse the abomination with domination
Creativity and patience (Patience, patience)
Since gases, I heard a verse from the pastors
Devils infiltrate the pastures, trick the masses
Fucking bastard!  My energy is classic
Essence never captured, rhythm in the rapture
Get your soul fractured ‘cause I mastered
Hot science, the laws of violence
Patience was the rock David used for Goliath
It’s like [?] with the 9-iron

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
The foul flagrant, blatant—blast Satans
From the school of mysteries I graduated
Edjumicated—my higher sense activated
I use [?] power from dead bones in Ghana
Stuck in the dungeon where my soul was plunged in
Travel through the Middle Passage—little bastard
Platinum, palladium grays under the stadium
Where they made baseballs with skulls and baby skin
Chaos in the cosmos—I’m a Vulcan
Grab your shoulder blade (Aaah)—leave your body soaking
Peace to my old dad, whose spirit is a nomad
Had me so sad, I resurrected him through vocab
I date back to when I had a favorite placemat
My face all fat, but I’m still saying grace, black
You walk like a Muslim, talk like a Muslim
But you evil, living in Shayṭān’s bosom
I see your energy—brown aura
I read the Qur’an, turn around and read the Torah
Within the Bible, there is the word of God
But I’ll murder y’all when it’s time for Jihad
As I meditate, revelate, I see flames
Deep impact—cities crushed by tidal waves
In the Bronx, I’m over your head like 4 trains
Dealing with my submental like the [?]
More to gain than there is to lose, so I choose
Right over wrong.  Disagreeable vehicles just deceiving you
I’m agreeable, unbelievable, achieving supreme status
My gats smack the [?], shots pop your apparatus
Something magical—it don’t seem right
‘Cause your third eye of green light lack keen sight
Accurate perception—pathetic.  I pop wires
[?], tongue swords, fire tire
My desire mash out mediocre with hell fire
