[Scratch Chorus]:
"Rap, hip hop, underground, mainstream"
"Non Stop Krooks, motherfucker take a look"
"These rappers ain't real they just doin' impressions"
"Commercial rap, hate it with a passion"

[C-Rayz Walz]:
Stuck in the cross hairs like Christ, disturbin' The Force
Havin' 9-11 thoughts while I'm swervin' a Porsche
But I'm a black Johnny Walker, put this on your ride
If you mainstream, I hope you gotta piss on the side
For the doers who white label whiskey rhymes
And think of dope hits quick like Whitney's mind
Just be fine
These morons swiftly sign the risky line and recoup until they 69
You can be in a group or solo gig
And you still come up short like Frodo kids
What's beef?
It's when speech release a clip from the hammer
When I spit you hear a beat rip, click on the banner
Slick with the barrel apparel, if I spit on aim
The flow's water travel, I can't get on planes
Apartment 3F to death, like I'm lookin' for steel
Get your Orange "Juice" Jones wig splitted and peeled
And if you relate to the drama
Dick, we all need a plate of some scama
Kids, debate and politic with piranhas
Six, slow mo slugs watch homo thugs on the ave track
Arrested by the beast for sellin' ass crack
Screamin' thug then squeezin' tampons
I'm so hard I have sex with my pants on
Radio play stay flagrant but ain't this foul?
They gave KRS head and drank Kris style/Cristal, wow
I seen you players, you haters, you fakers and rapers
I use razors as faders, laser face your shape up
Cause all you wanted was a plate to eat
And all they wanted was your tape and your face as a place to skeet
For slave ship niggas that walk to school
Carry guns for my sons that taught ?
Don't get your jaw wired up, tiger cub
The rhymes you write on lily pads get smashed by fire trucks
