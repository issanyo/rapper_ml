[Verse 1: RodStarz]
I promised I would rap like a superstar rap
Spit like a monster, put myself on the map
First rap in English, then rap in Spanish
Que lo que tu dice, boy, I cause damage
International worldwide, resistance in my lyrics
Walkin down these Mean Streets, to the House of Spirits
Yo represento lo que canto en mi canciones
Amor, justicia, hip-hop revoluciones
Listen here, we done preachin' to the choir
We stayed on the block, took the neighborhood higher
I guess I just listen to the little voice speakin'
The one that said, "Never deny what you seekin'"
That made me a believer, que todo es possible
Mi flow como la lucha, siempre sigue
They call it ADD when you wildin' and don't listen
They make think you crazy if you question they system

[Hook: G1]
Call me crazy
'Cause I look different than you
Spark fear out the corner of yo' peripheral?
Call me crazy, like I'm the violent one
Livin' in the empire that was born out the gun
Now that's crazy
What I'm supposed to do?
When they shut the stores down and there ain't no food?
Now that's crazy
Like I'm the violent one
Livin' in the empire that was born out the gun

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
Crazy is as crazy does
Attack the industry wit a chainsaw for a crazy buzz
What's crazy is $2.50 for a fare
Tryna get iced out, but its snow everywhere (yeah!)
A cold world we livin' in, ol' girl, pimpin kin
I'm general Tso, minus the boneless chicken
And the soulless victims, homeless conditions
Why fight my brother, when I can beat the system?
I write 16's in 16 minutes (Impossible!)
That's what it is, but I know what it isn't
Crazy, the words Garvey spoke
The same slang as Malcolm, man, it's too many quotes
The wolf, lickin' the blade, thinkin' its kool-aid
Bloodthirsty, turnin' ourselves into slaves
Whats crazy is you in a gang, but won't do a god-damned thang
When the police bang on the corners
We learn how to hang with no more nooses
Just mad trees, the same old thang
What's crazy's how they control our brain
With these demonic songs, that that radio play
You a revolutionary? Yeah, it's all good
But they don't know you in the hood
What's good? That's crazy!
And I don't got no time to look it
Crazy!
My straight jacket on crooked
Now that's crazy!

[Hook: G1]
Call me crazy
'Cause I look different than you
Spark fear out the corner of yo' peripheral?
Call me crazy, like I'm the violent one
Livin' in the empire that was born out the gun
Now that's crazy
What I'm supposed to do?
When they shut the stores down and there ain't no food?
Now that's crazy
Like I'm the violent one
Livin' in the empire that was born out the gun

[Verse 3: G1]
Like I lost my marbles, like all I wanna do is criticize and argue
Like my screws loose, 'cause I say what I want to
Shit, say what I got to, es por eso que canto
Queremos un cambio, en eso andamos
Yo creo caminos, no creo en obstaculos
You say I'm loco and need a doctor
I say, "lets be realistic and do the the impossible"
Check it out, I'm on a higher plane
Some say it ain't sane, I say it's okay
Let yo' mind sway, ride the wave
Better that than on land and stuck in one place
They want you sedated, drugged, and medicated
More paper in the pockets of the drug fabricators
All indicators show our society's sick
Diseased by greed; that's the diagnosis

[Hook: G1]
Now that's crazy
'Cause I look different than you?
Spark fear out the corner of yo' peripheral?
Call me crazy, like I'm the violent one
Livin' in the empire that was born out the gun
Now that's crazy
What I'm supposed to do?
When they shut the stores down and there ain't no food?
Now that's crazy
Like I'm the violent one
Livin' in the empire that was born out the gun

[Outro]
You people are crazy!
