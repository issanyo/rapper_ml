Jon Doe ft. C-Rayz Walz - “These Bills”
[Emcee(s): C-Rayz Walz]
[Producer(s): Jon Doe]

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
I asked my moms if I could write this bomb while my son lay
When I finished this song, it was Sunday
Urban hippie, my breath smell like hummus
Nobody want to give.  They just want from us
In the hood, it’s all good, but it get better
‘Cause I think it’s bad when brothers die for mad cheddar
Mice trapped together.  Rats pack whatever
Cats snap, they’re clever.  Dogs scrap forever
This is Roots, the part Alex Haley forgets
We come home to roost with Chicken George and grits
With the rhyme and Kunta Kinte, we black weapons
Confined to the plantation, we half-stepping
When I flip, they try to write these tight verses
I’ll spit and forget to be a nice person
Amongst ill brothers where colors integrate
At a toxic state, a fingerpaint wasting space
My rebuttal will smash your shuttle
With brass knuckles in a scuffle, I must trust who? (Chorus)

[Hook 1: C-Rayz Walz]
Fuck these motherfucking bills
Somebody’s about to get killed
I’m hungry.  Feels like I’m starving for a deal
And all I really want is a meal
Fuck these motherfucking bills
Somebody’s about to get killed
I’m hungry.  Feels like I’m starving for a deal

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
Yo, as nice as used to be with freestyle
Meanwhile, I’m five minutes away from the penile
And these styles is life, and these trials are strife
With each mile I hike, man, my feet get tired.  Don’t make
Me come through banging this and wake your block
To get in the place to be, you had to break a lock
Tapeless, in the void alone, weightless
Stranded on Earth with a poem—take this!
Still holding the chrome and I trust in the mic
Even if we lose the fight, right? (Blao!)

[Hook 1: C-Rayz Walz]
Fuck these motherfucking bills
Somebody’s about to get killed
I’m hungry.  Feels like I’m starving for a deal
And all I really want is a meal
Fuck these motherfucking bills
Somebody’s about to get killed
I’m hungry.  Feels like I’m starving for a deal

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
I’m a free throw shooter speaking more Buddha
To let his name be praised on a page of computers
Retribution in the form of an advance in exchange
For a song and a dance.  (Huh) Go figure
Before I spark the Ark, walk the legacy, start
Then we could all duke it out like Cherokee Park
Hit the canvas.  An artist looking for answers
Painted words dance like ancestor pandas with scanners
Trials and trivia smile and quiz
You know how it is in the music biz
Hold heat, roll deep, speak missiles, talk shit
[?] eat tissues
A code of law to my soldiers, this is my ode to y’all
General over drawers, khakis, and overalls
Keep your ear to the street and persevere (Yeah!)
Keep your mind to the goods ‘cause the worst is here
Apocalyptic storm begin the end normally
If there’s more to be (Sure), we all shall see

[Hook 1: C-Rayz Walz]
Fuck these motherfucking bills
Somebody’s about to get killed
I’m hungry.  Feels like I’m starving for a deal
And all I really want is a meal
Fuck these motherfucking bills
Somebody’s about to get killed
I’m hungry.  Feels like I’m starving for a deal

[Hook 2: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
All y’all get is mathematics this year
I swear.  Even if a tear fall from my ear
In attempts to hear wisdom I’m spitting
From the start of me ‘til the death of my next beginning

[Outro: C-Rayz Walz]
Jon Doe, C-Rayz Walz.  Face in the cut.  In a check-cashing place.  These bills.  Get killed.  Fight, right? (Blao!)
