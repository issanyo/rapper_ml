(Malcolm X Intro)

THEY KILLED THE PANTHERS WITH THE DOPE
THEY KILLED THE HOOD WITH THE CRACK
NOW THEY MURDERIN THESE YOUNG BROTHERS W/ RAP
ACTUAL FACT
And it's Unbelieveable Scrap/
That you not here/
Even tho you Heard me Loud & Clear/
It's Weird
How we used to know the Science of Precious Metal & Stone
Now we stuck in The Ghetto w/ Chrome
THE GOLDEN LEGACY
We not Slaves
We're just a long way from our Home
And you must learn
Becuz we forgot what we know
Well
See The Light at The End of The Tunnel
And how it glows
That's ya stop
They study our Energy and make comical Shows
SO KEEP REPPIN THE SONG
WHEN YOU WEATHER THE STORM
SUCCESSFUL AGAINST ME
NO WEAPON THAT'S FORMED
THE SESSIONS ARE LONG
THE NIGHTS ARE SHORTER THEN THE FUN LIKE
SAVINGS DAY SUN LIGHT
ATTEMPTS TO HOLD TIME LIKE YA TONGUE STRIKE?
THE GREAT HYPE
SHOWING NO FEAR W/ STAGE FRIGHT
BACK TO LIFE
BUT TIME GOES NOWHERE
WE'VE ALWAYS STAYED BRIGHT!

HOOK
THE GOLDEN LEGACY
WE USED TO BE KINGS AND QUEENS
NOW WE DYING FOR MATERIAL THINGS
CHAINS & RINGS
A NEVER GET YOU THAT FAR
IF YOU WANNA FIND GOD
DIG DEEP INTO YASELF!
THE GOLDEN LEGACY
WE USED TO BE KINGS AND QUEENS
NOW WE DYING FOR MATERIAL THINGS
CHAINS & RINGS

VERSE 2
DON'T SHOW ME YOUR TOUGH
I ALREADY KNOW WHO YOU BE
SHOW ME YOURE AN INTELLIGENT ASSET TO THE COMMUNITY
RAISE A CHILD
TRADE A SMILE FOR YA TRIAL AND THINK HOW OUR ANCESTORS HAD TO PAY DUES AND WALK MILES
BUILD A POOL
LEAD A SCHOOL
FEED A FOOL
TEACH A TOOL
KEEP IN TUNE
SPEAK AND DO
REACH THE TOMB
SHOW & PROVE
DROP A JEWEL ON THE YOUTH AND LET EM KNOW
"THEY WANNA LOCK YOU UP, THROW AWAY THE KEY......AND NEVER LET YOU GO"
THE PETALS SO OLD ON A FLOWER UNATTENDED
WHO CONTINUES TO GROW
THRU A GOLDEN LEGACY REMEMBERED
THEY ONLY COME IN WHEN YOU INVITE EM TO BITE
BUT EVERYTHING IN THE DARK MUST COME TO THE LIGHT
RIGHT?
LIKE WE TRIED TO BE RIGHT
SO WE TRIED TO BE WHITE
MISSED THE FOREST FOR THE TREES
EVEN DIED IN EXCHANGE OF A LIFE OF HORROR & FRIGHT
SO TOMORROW'S TONIGHT
AND TODAY IS YESTERDAY MANIFESTED THRU SIGHT!

HOOK
THE GOLDEN LEGACY
WE USED TO BE KINGS AND QUEENS
NOW WE DYING
FOR MATERIAL THINGS
CHAINS & RINGS
A NEVER GET YOU THAT FAR
IF YOU WANNA FIND GOD
DIG DEEP INTO YASELF!

VERSE 3
WE WAS ROCKIN BEEPERS AND SNEAKERS
OGS SLEPT WITH THE HEAT CUZ
IT'S A COLD WORLD
AND BODY SNATCHERS'LL CREEP UP
WHEN YOU DISCOVER
THE SCIENCE OF THE COVENANT
& SECRET DOCUMENTS IN RUSSIA THAT LEFT SCIENTIST HUNTED
THE MAN WHO MADE CLOCKS
IS THE SAME COLOR AS CHUKKAS
THAT BLACK JOINTS
NAH THE BROWN ONES BROTHER
NOW WE ARROGANT SAVAGES DRUNKEN W/ GLEE
FIGHTING LIKE VIKINGS
FOR A TREASURE THAT'S BURIED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
IF I SAY WE GOTTE BE FREE
IT'S GOTTA BE TRUE
& THE MOST LOGICAL PROOF
IS PROBABLY ME
WE HANG IN CORNERSTORES
WE USED TO HAVE THE CORNER STONE CREATION
ON TRAINS AGAINST TRACKS
LIKE JOHN HENRY BANGIN
I'M SAYING
MY HAIR'S WOOLY
MY BACK IS STRONG
MY FEET LIKE COAL
MY SKIN IS BROWN
MY PARENTS WERE SLAVES
MY NAME'S RAGE IN CONTROL
TO IMAGINE THE HEIGHT OF YOUR PRIME
DELVE INTO THE BACK OF YOUR MIND
AND BRING TO THE FOREFRONT WHAT WAS LEFT BEHIND IN

HOOK
THE GOLDEN LEGACY
WE USED TO BE KINGS AND QUEENS
NOW WE DYING FOR MATERIAL THINGS
CHAINS & RINGS
A NEVER GET YOU THAT FAR PAW
IF YOU WANNA FIND GOD
DIG DEEP INTO YASELF!

WE'VE COME A LONG WAY
BUT WE STILL NOT HOME
NOT UNTIL WE SNATCH THE CROWNS
AND RECLAIM THE THRONES
NOT A DEAD ONE
BUT THIS IS ONE FOR THE DEAD
CUZ WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE
I DONE WHAT I SAID
