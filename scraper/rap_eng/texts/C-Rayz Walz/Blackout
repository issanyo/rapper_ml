[Emcee(s): C-Rayz Walz and 4th Pyramid]
[Producer(s): MYK DEFY]

[Intro: 4th Pyramid and C-Rayz Walz]
4th Pyramid: You sell that picture illegally, I’m suing you.  What’s wrong with you?
C-Rayz Walz: Triple bypass. Put it on my tab, America!

[Hook: 4th Pyramid and C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
We're black and we wanna be white
We're black and we wanna be white
We're black and we wanna be white
All night, all right, all hype

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
I'm black, wanna be white.  For the first time in life, I wanna
Be right.  I know this is wrong.  I’m getting accused, they
Frisk me at night.  I know what it is.  Give me the light.  If I was
Blanco, I'd be invisible to pig's sight.  I'm
Black, wanna be white, well-dressed, speaking polite, self-
-stressed, living a lie.  Well, I guess this is life.  All the
Dues I’ve paid, I wanna be “dude” in the shade, rocking
Hard like I was raised in the rave.  Rayz got the vo-
-cab that made most mad when I spoke like graff.  Is it
Bad I think, drink, joke, and smoke like dad?  Peak at
Trees.  These bad seeds hang on corners
Raised by murderers and mourners (Yeah).  I’ma be the
Shit at the meeting, statistically speaking, playing golf on the
Weekend with Ralph Lauren, Christopher, and Keenan.  When the
Ivory Wayans/weighings, the scales brake.  Who can deny me
Payment?  Well, alright.  I'm all-white—I finally make it

[Hook: 4th Pyramid and C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
We're white but we wanna be black
We're white but we wanna be black
We're white but we wanna be black
Fight back, like this, like that

[Verse 2: 4th Pyramid]
I’m white, wanna be black.  A daunting task that’s haunting me
Gats, drunk.  Started to laugh.  My com-
-plex is like, “Pardon my dad.”  I’ll respect you.  You
Started the fad.  I got no problems with that, but
How would you feel if you lived in the village and were
Told all your ancestors did was steal, kill, and pillage?
I know not of my past.  One
Grown out of gods, anonymous tags
Burden bestowed, I want to escape.  I don't
Have it made ‘cause of my skin—it's just not the case
Family don't understand artistic views, feel like
“Damn it!  Why I have to live with fools?”  I did
Me.  Fuck what I did in school.  To live
Free feels like forbidden fruit.  I'm
Shackled, need my gene pool, but it's all scattered
Call Devil ‘cause I need food.  It don't matter

[Hook: 4th Pyramid and C-Rayz Walz]
We're black and we wanna be white
We're black and we wanna be white
We're black and we wanna be white
All night, all right, all hype
We're white but we wanna be black
We're white but we wanna be black
We're white but we wanna be black
Fight back, like this, like that

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
If you
Black with a degree and you work and got a happy fa-
-mily, they say you wanna be white.  If you
White, rebel, smoke weed, listen to rap, and live
Free, they say you wanna be black.  There's nothing in
Between, so this medium means you double excel
On Smallville and dinner is beans.  There's two
Classes: the rich and the poor.  Everybody else
Run wild in the halls! (Look, man)

[Verse 4: 4th Pyramid]
I envy long-standing tradition
Tension starts from what you do to me through dissing (Stop it)
The past is done and was never my ambition (Nope)
And now I will plan for that tin can to piss in
‘Cause some of my people poverty-stricken
Sleeping in the same spot that they probably shit in (Come on)
Kill you (Kill you) in Alaska for some gold
Still viewed as master of the globe

[Hook: 4th Pyramid and C-Rayz Walz]
We're black and we wanna be white
We're black and we wanna be white
We're black and we wanna be white
All night, all right, all hype
