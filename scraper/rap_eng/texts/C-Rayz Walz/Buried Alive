[Verse 1]
My mental capacity is far above the norm
Spitting that verbal venom like a women scorned
Akila da Hun and DJ Tom Select
They don't want you to hear ‘cause the words pose a threat
I bring vision to the blind, hearing to the deaf
Awakening the sleep to all the lies that they give
Metaphysical, that's the stuff that I be learning
Mind blowing, psychic yearning, gaining knowledge that's the purpose
No doubt you are rocking with the best
Rebels for the cause, the new hip hop resistance
This is worldwide, from Germany to ATL
In a sea full of sharks but good always prevails
I came giving you what you what so you would want what I have
They knock me but can't stop me, my talent they wish they had
Jewel dropper, mic rocker, lyrical monster
Exposing demons in the flesh, call’ em imposters
Success is no surprise, I'm just that sick
A legend full of wisdom like David and Goliath
Bringing glad tithings like the prophets of past
I serve a higher power that's why that's why them demons be mad

[Hook]
Surviving the storms, surviving the rain
Like ants through trials the strength to withstand
No matter the weather, we adapt to the change
We never conform we just create our own lanes

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
?

[Verse 3]
Yo I'm amazed at the amount of ignorance nowadays
Where the fools and the lames are all that ever get played
They all claim to eat I'll ain't none as good as me
Demolition Diva I’m a master MC
Akila da Hun reaping havoc like the reaper
With A M on my chest ‘cause I’m a super MC
Flow is ridiculous, food for thought I be giving them
My rhymes are therapeutic for your mental and your physical
Hip hop is dying overrun by losers
They ask me how I feel I reply … to it
Too many fake rappers not enough real MCs
They all sound the same ain't no originality
Real from the start I always spit from the heart
Collab with DJ Tom Select and now I'm a star
Dinner for your mind with each and every single bar
I can broaden your perspective you just tell me how far

[Hook]
Surviving the storms, surviving the rain
Like ants through trials the strength to withstand
No matter the weather, we adapt to the change
We never conform we just create our own lanes
