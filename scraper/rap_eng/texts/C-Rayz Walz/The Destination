Angle Verse:
The destination, minutes of a mental staycation, hateful nation
Unravel your station with these travel agents
Gavel rapping having faces in your place’s basement
Your castle’s cracking; foundation’s shaking to make a statement
Life no longer vacant, I’m talking kicks and bass and 808s
Regularly Angle and C-Rayz lace
Just a taste of culinary haste, savagely lambasted canaries
Having leaven tequila wasted
With a punchline zinger I can staple a singer, it’s no fair
Ain’t nobody crying, ain’t nobody worried, I can take you, but you don’t want to go there
Definitive Bedtime Stories vividly getting gory, cynic who’s snoring
I’ll marionette you to cut your eyelids off for me
It’s a journey, but maybe with no finale
Wisdom is learning to take in the lookout view of the valley
And being humble enough, to know when you done stumbled the bluff
Uncut, ‘til your version of the pearly gates shut
Hook (C-Rayz Walz & Angle):
I’m in the place where it starts, trace elements to the park past dark
Got gassed up, and misplaced your art
These is trife bars, uh uh, not nice bars
Like “fuck your mother”, “I wanna fight” bars
All day, all day and at the end of the night
It is what it is and it’ll be alright
If I’m willing to live with it, then it’s worth dying for
It comes back ‘cause I’m sending it off

C-Rayz Walz Verse
Hook Repeat
Verse 3:
Creators ask me what style I might could
I’m saying make it good, whether it’s for the ladies or straight hood
I’ll club one for the clubbin’. I’ll love one for the muffins
Pinata one for stuffins ‘cause I’m always into something
Soul clapping, what I’m into, every time I put my pen to
The sword and good lord you’re out of body, well I meant to send you
Violence I don’t condone, but I’m at home on a microphone
Where vocal tones will stab your brain with nose bone
Witch with this wizard getting her funky emotions licked
She’ll wake up back in Kansas like some ruby slippers clicked
With a calendar montage and a rewinding clock (Planet Rock on your block)
I line drop ‘cause the history is all we got
Hook 3 (C-Rayz Walz & Angle):
Disposable, the unchosen few
You, boooo, you a ways from the start
I’m in the place where it starts, trace elements to the park past dark
Got gassed up, and misplaced your art
These is trife bars, uh uh, not nice bars
Like “fuck your mother”, “I wanna fight” bars
All day, all day and at the end of the night
It is what it is and it’ll be alright
	The Destination
