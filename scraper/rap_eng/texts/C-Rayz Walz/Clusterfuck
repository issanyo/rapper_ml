Tell ya boy to play xkwisit and c rayz walz/
Then after that get off the d.j.'s balls/
They dropping CDs straight to the stalls and d day falls/
When they release a dookie album
With green day flaws/
In the presence of living legends I grip a spliff in the session like smith and wessons when gettin weapons on misconceptions/
Then bustin off in six directions without gettin questioned,/
I'm the prescription when beats bump/
Like a sick infection/
Beefin over wall posts n get it poppin for tweeting/
They not competing on the blocks that I beast in/
(Nah Uh!)
Where every summer seems getting shots in season/
No logical reason, The heathens in the hospital bleeding/
(He Stopped Breathing)
So run n tell the cops at the precinct/
I've been nice with the hands since odds and evens/
I'm not from the p-jects but my block's got some respect/
Hear ya shit, Stop it and eject, block it and reject/
