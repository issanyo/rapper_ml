[Intro: Pudge]
Haha ahahaha.  C-Rayz, unfortunately [?].  Everybody say:

[Hook: Pudge]
I don’t really be
Feeling how and what it is you’re
Saying and the messages
Relaying.  Once again, everybody say:
We don’t really, really be
Feeling how and what it is you’re
Saying and all the messages
Relaying.  Second part of the hook, it’s like:
Music a fi take over.  You know
People a fi take over.  And, yes
Love it a fi take over.  You know
Before we gon’ get take over

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
Just like them
Crazy ladies in the garden.  That’s right
I’m talking to the seeds ‘cause they’re starving.  There’s light
We need water.  I beg you pardon, get right
‘Cause this left side’ll disorder their squadron

Eighty thousand dollars for a chain—you sick
(Bwoy!) It only costs ten G’s for a barber shop
Where you can you employ your clique.  That’s just
Sheisty.  That’s selfishness
Look at the community.  The rhymes you spit make
Shorty want gun, make girl want dick-
-tionary, but she can’t find no work.  Just
Hurry.  You’re the income—find those words.  Your mind’s
Blurry.  You are defined as herb.  This is
Worry.  You’re getting on my nerves.  I’m not
Ready, known to give up these songs.  I’m too
Strong ‘cause the music moved me along.  I got
Music pumping through my veins.  Music
I use it to bring confusion on the train, and when the
Red light stops confusion, the doors
Open.  Lean off the walls/Walz ‘cause I’m moving.  I’ve got...
