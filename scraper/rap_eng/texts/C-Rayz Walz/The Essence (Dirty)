[Hook 1: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
For those that said I couldn't do it
I'm here to show and prove it!

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
I'm Gandhi with a bulletproof vest (What?)
Malcolm X kickin' a freestyle.  What you expect? (That's fresh)
You ain't expect Martin Luther King with a gat
Leavin' a church yelling "Go back!"
What up, [?]?  You know how it go, fams
Large wingspan like the son of Rodan
Stuck between Godzilla and Bunzilla (Huh?)
Fingerhut and fingerpaint—what?
Jabba the Hutt going corrupt
You ain't ready for the twin-double cypher uppercuts—plus
I'm off-the-bean-curd rap
You ain't ready for the hypodermic ginseng mat

[Hook 2: C-Rayz Walz]
In the club, it's over the bub
In the car, it's over the dub
In the street, it's beef over the slugs
Watch out for the cheeba—it's under the rug
And it still bugs.  And I'm still wired
And there's still electrical fire for desire
And there's still truth for the liar
And it's still C-Rayz with my name on the flier

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
For those that said I couldn't do it
I had to show and prove I was in tune with the music
Jay-Z stole my Blueprint for the single
He got a copy from Kinkos
Drillin' and killin' it.  Persephone
Caught between Mills and Stephanie and Persephone
Either way, I'm still trapped in Hades
I never been Slim but my attitude stay Shady
And this is beyond the records
You gotta check it—there's more behind the methods
There's some blackin' out
Tat skin—right arm with the ham and that's about
You better watch out—overskilled, underplayed
Chicks I deal with slam like Sonya Blade
Y'all ain't ready for the ill metaphors
Have y'all little niggas screamin', "No, Gandolf!"

[Hook 2: C-Rayz Walz]
In the club, it's over the bub
In the car, it's over the dub
In the street, it's beef over the slugs
Watch out for the cheeba—it's under the rug
And it still bugs.  And I'm still wired
And there's still electrical fire for desire
And there's still truth for the liar
And it's still C-Rayz with my name on the flier

[Hook 1: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
For those that said I couldn't do it
I'm here to show and prove

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
Beat bangin' ya.  This is Castlevania
I rap over your head like drats in Arabia
Get ya mind right (Right) or your brain left (Left)
This is excited life and plain death
Extravaganza, vocal bonanza
Vocal burner murderer—beef in the stanza
Mazda 626s and crucifixes ('86)
Blind, patient—ready for religion
Lady on the train lookin' at me idle (Oh, hello)
Judgmental but she still holding a Bible
I burst out into a wild freestyle
Told the conductor "Calm down"
It's a urgency to kill those that's fake
'Fore I flip, may you press the emergency brake
The next stop will come after the door's closin'
No leanin' on the Walz while I'm posin'

[Hook 2: C-Rayz Walz]
In the club, it's over the bub
In the car, it's over the dub
In the street, it's beef over the slugs
Watch out for the cheeba—it's under the rug
And it still bugs.  And I'm still wired
And there's still electrical fire for desire
And there's still truth for the liar
And it's still C-Rayz with my name on the flier

[Outro: C-Rayz Walz]
Still Chief Rayz.  I'm here to show and prove it!  Still Chief Rayz.  It's The Essence.  Raw.  I'm here
