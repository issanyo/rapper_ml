I'm at War w/ My Uncle like Richard Wright in Native Sun
Trying to Figure where this hatred's from
It's Crazy (
Metro card shuffles is strange
Beggin for Change but Conditions Remain
5 Borough thoro
International Vocal in Sync
We walk the Plank & Live on The Brink
We in The Melting Pot
And The Block is Hot
You Better go to Egypt if you wanna sling Rock
Land of the Fees
Home of The Paid
Skeletons in The Closet
And the Bed you Made is a Grave
Brooklyn Babylon
A Rumble in The Bronx we Bomb
Cuz it's Tanks in The Streets Like Heat in Nam
Nuclear Winter
Tropical Storm
A Cold World But The Snow ain't form yet/ Come On!
Keep Going!
The Next Stop we Off/
In Hard Times you Cannot be Soft
Emergency Brake!!!

HOOK
MY ANGRY UNCLE
WANTS ME DEAD
CUZ I AINT GIVE HIM ALL MY BREAD
AND WE KNOW
WHEN THINGS COST A ARM AND A LEG
THAT'S WHEN YOU GOTTA USE YO HEAD
STOCKS & JONES
POP ROCKS, GLOCKS & PEOMS
SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT
BUT THIS MONEY IS OLD
THIS IS THE SAME LAND
THAT THEY USED TO HANG ME
Hmmmmm
NOW I KNOW WHY MY UNCLE'S ANGRY

VERSE 2
And that's right (that's right)
I'm on that beezerbungee
Cuz the seeds are hungry
And the D's are Coming
For that FEMA Money
So When the Trees are Nuggy
Snakes Shake They Ass
That's when the Grass needs cutting
And all they stack is Flouride on The Rack
Don't Brush
Ya Brain on Zap
Don't Trust
That Drano Tap
It's Not Water
It's a Slaughter
Out of Order
That's a Natural Fact
And when it's going your way
Like the MTA
You'll need a Full Tank of Gas for ya Empty Faith!
When The People's Petro
The Revolutions Retro
Then The Devil puts the Metal to ya Face Like Destro!
Global Warming
This is Red Dawn
Potholes in My Lawn Sun
Come On!
Keep Going!
The Best Cots up North
In Hard Times you Cannot be Soft
Emergency Brake!!!

I'm from a Block where you can still get Beat up in Broad Day
And nobody won't say nothing
Where The Cops Stare
Cuz it's Rocks & Glocks Here
Yeah
But tell me who gon Spray Something
So The Street impress you
Till somebody press you
And wet you
Cuz of how you Dressed
Oooohhhh
It's No Mercy
We Drunk but so thirsty
The Toughest Punks you know
Rehearsing
Coppin New Shit
But ya Kids is Dirty
Food Stamps
Foamcores, Crew Flicks & Jersey's
Urban Legend
For All dogs who go to Heaven
Well I wonder where the Hell's my Bredren Reppin?
Not Tax Return/
You Go Back to the Essence/
Old Facts we Learn/
You Soul Clap for The Blessings
Keep Growing
Cuz when you stop we Gone
In Hard Times you cannot be Soft
Emergency Brake!!!
