Had to be me
Not a clone or a digibot
Sun cycled weather patterns
Premrock the equinox
It had to be me
Down by ...
A thin line between art and war, the ...
And the crowds that perform on the battlefield
...
But still ready for cheers
Where everyone knows your name
And the only thing that's consistently constant was the change

Play the game off the hinges and frames
Mcloud in the crowd
What now? Only one will remain
Transcending the blame
Cause if there's one in the same
The energy never leaves, it just freezes the frame

...
My sneeze is the flame
And when I'm sick in my way, every beat is amazed
And when I sing to myself, I find my sense in a cell
When I dwell
Living like a beast in a cage

Had to be me
Within the beat, reppin the street, blessin his speech
(Y'all know me)
Had to be me
That was born after thirty-six weeks
(Pleased to meet me)
Had to be me
In the stands with the fans drop the heat
(Y'all know me)
Had to be me
Twenty five eight always on my grind no sleep
(We be reppin this shit since day one)

So on a low, I'm most deep when I raise
The level of the cut (What?)
Cause it's peace bein raised
Unless it's beat bein braised
And I'm chief in the haze
...

I can see why most of yall are callin Khan, I hope the folks are callin on
I got the mind and focus of Travolta in phenomenon
I even up the odds between the commoners and comodans
My teeth are fucked so we don't need a closeup of the monologue
I'm as live as a .., shit I could dive in the lava
Naked is naked but, say that's my kinda sauna
You rhyme like a ..., but got the...
Just cause your on a dick don't mean you got the mind of a rider
See, now my feet are restin on the neck of the skeptics
Testin my ethics to adhere to the acceptable methods
Yeah, I want hugs and kisses
I want somethin vicious
.. question get.. except what they're left with
I'm not a reasonable god
I'll crush the peas in your pod
While they pleadin I'm like "Please, I ain't squeezin that hard!"
If you find a silver lining then you've seen a mirage
Cause what goes around tokes you out and leaves you to rot

Had to be me
Within the beat, reppin the street, blessin his speech
(Y'all know me)
Had to be me
That was born after thirty-six weeks
(Pleased to meet me)
Had to be me
In the stands with the fans drop the heat
(Y'all know me)
Had to be me
Twenty five eight always on my grind no sleep
(We be reppin this shit since day one)

Had to be prem, that crem de la crem
That's bent off that crem demend and Jim blended whisky bender again
Prone to offend these gender bendin women and men
Tryin to contend their prepubescent phlegm
Can't react oppression never developed the gems
My pen is unrelentin fight attempts to do a dental expense
My shine with make the eye on the pyramid blink
Vaginas flow the same I think your period sink
That hand in the ink, I'm doctorin the flows
Why you posturing? It shows your not a flow nobody cares what you think
My spit game is razor blade, tailor made for 808s
I double the appraisal of a label once they say my name
The trouble I will save you
Just rearrange the names son stage
Cause we don't rap the same, go get a facial son is acting vain
Pre-packaged plastic wrappin actors not attractin fame
Screamin at your dame tryin to rearrange her mattress sprains
PremRock will acclimate accelerate and activate
Grabbin dollars off the backboard then hand him back his change
Saying ... and my reaction "Eh, that's a shame"
Reality distorted you hallucinatin accolades
..., son we don't need that
These bad .. thug talkin suited ...
...
Elbow the free-throw
...
Stand around like pizza dough
Different town, freak the show
Already off runnin once I hit it like I'm...
Had to be that blown speaker, preacher keep the even flow
I'm approaching every stage like 'Listen, yall don't even know"
