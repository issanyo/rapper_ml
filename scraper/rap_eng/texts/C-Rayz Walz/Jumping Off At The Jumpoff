Don't wanna wind it up hey hey (hey hey)

When I'm in the club I come here to party
Up rock the body, drink so Bacardi
When the tough ones is up jump, I spot 'em
"Like they want problems, you want 'em you got 'em" - Method Man 'Sub Crazy'

[Verse One] [C-Rayz Walz]:
I'm tryin' to shake it up
Y'all wanna get me stirred
It's all good girl, Lucifer
I'm not the value
You wanna secretly want me?
I can tell by your underarm
(Keepin' it funky)
Juvenile delinquents
You'll know where they drink when
See the god blingin', now they wanna bring it
I'm leavin' on the next plane
After greens, I'll be back again
When I'm in the club I come here to party
Up rock the body, drink so Bacardi
When the tough ones is up jump, I spot 'em
"Like they want problems, you want 'em you got 'em"

[Hook]:
Don't wanna wind it up hey hey (hey hey)
Don't wanna shake it up, shook it up, hey hey (hey hey)

[Verse Two] [C-Rayz Walz]:
Made for woman, strong enough for a man
I don't wanna slam dance with him, that ain't the plan
Messin' with the nerd you'll be tongue kissin' the curb
American History X, word
I'm a P.T.P.er
Dick Vitale
Vidal Saloon
Lead out, blast rooms
In the back, cats like "Where's your bear hat?"
Red Stripe to the dome
Beer cap
Savage cats get their wigs pushed to the cabbage patch
Thinkin' I'm Cringer, I'm really Battle Cat
16 bars
32 drinks

What you want beef with a monster?
I'm here for mimosa sponsors
"Like they want problems, you want 'em you got 'em"

When I'm in the club I come here to party
Up rock the body, drink so Bacardi
When the tough ones up jump, I spot 'em
"If you want problems, you want 'em you got 'em"
When I'm in the club I come to get high
Up from the jungle, make like a good guy
When the tough ones up jump I spot 'em
"Like they want problems, you want 'em you got 'em"

[Hook]:
Don't wanna wind it up hey hey (hey hey)
Don't wanna shake it up, shook it up, hey hey (hey hey)
