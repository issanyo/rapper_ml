To all the single mothers, (Keep a strong mind, stay focused)
Even though daddy ain't here, (We know you love us)
That's why I dedicate this song to you
Brighter days are coming.  (We'll give the world to you)
To all the single mothers, (Keep a strong mind, stay focused)
Even though daddy ain't here, (We know you love us)
That's why I dedicate this song to you
Brighter days are coming.  (We’re gonna give the world to you)

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
It takes a strong mother to make a child special
You ain't sneeze, but indeed, ma, God bless you
It's trife—life stress could test your vessel
You made from the best stuff on Earth like breast milk
Deep in your shell, you need cheese like manicotti
Without a male hottie groping all over your body
Pamper yourself with oils and bubble baths
Let Calgon take you away from the troubled path
You ain't got a man?  Do the math with the man in you
Love yourself, instead of these male animals
It's true.  Stop looking, you'll receive what you need
Pay the bills and build—you got seeds to feed
Blessed is the mother when the man leave her
So take a breather.  You ain't a hoe, bitch, or a skeezer
You Queen Nefertiti and Zinga and Sheeba
So keep a strong mind and stay focused ‘cause we need ya

To all the single mothers, (Keep a strong mind, stay focused)
Even though daddy ain't here, (We know you love us)

Brighter days are coming.  (We’re gonna give the world to you)

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
Caught between, school, job, babysitter
Thinking 'bout your baby father like, "That crazy..."
Wait, it's a small world.  It belongs to the kids
What goes around comes around—pretend he's doing a bid
Have love in your heart, keep food in the fridge
Fruits and vegetables—health is wealth—eat to live
Whether you Muslim, Jewish, Buddha, or Christian
This for every woman standing solo in the kitchen
Over hot pots cooking and the kids won't listen
Nobody holding you down and you feel like flipping
We know life ain't easy when you alone working hard
But it's worth it—you got the perfect job
Teaching the babies.  Motherhood's a mystery force
Force your positive thoughts to change history's course
Of course you think he ain't doing nothing for you
Not true, boo.  He gave the world to you

To all the single mothers, (Keep a strong mind, stay focused)

Brighter days are coming.  (We’re gonna give the world to you)

[Bridge 1: Beba, C-Rayz Walz, Fatimah, Imani, Krystal, Rachelle, and Shani]
Mama loves us when no one cares
Thinking of us, mom was always there
Papa's maybe mama's baby
Protect and raise me.  The world is crazy

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
For all the long hours and the sleepless nights
Your strong power and the needless fights
You a trooper to make it this far
Yo, it's 10 o’clock and you know where your children are
Sh-sheets on the bed, roof over your head
Sh-shoes on the feet, s-seasonal threads
Congratulation on the nation you saving
Kids make it ‘cause of your hard work and dedication
For your love, discipline, and sacrifice
You won't have no beef in the afterlife
It'll be a great ending (Yup) thanks to a good start (Aw man)
Life's a movie and guess who missed the good part?

To all the single mothers, (Keep a strong mind, stay focused)
