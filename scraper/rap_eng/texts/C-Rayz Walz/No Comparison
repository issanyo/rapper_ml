[Verse One] [C-Rayz Walz]:
No comparison to craft, compassion slash connection
No chronological creation calculates conception
I cop a shit on stage
In the name of Cochran
For those that wanna judge me for what I'm droppin'
It's so embarrassin', no comparison, nothin' like you
Despite Jews your punchlines are older than Ice Cube
And they killed your cousin
I'm real, you frontin'
You got Boyz N The Hood, but they won't do nothin'
Hey
Is there a problem here?
Yeah, I'm strapped you know me
You an MC Eiht and they clapped your homie
The difference between me and you?
I'm fact you phoney
Banana in your tailpipe bitch, Axel Foley
I keeps it movin'
Like U-Haul drive
You repeat stupid, so you hog tied
Talk about King Of New York smokin' Camels and black sandals
Must've been that big apple juice and Jack Daniels
It's no comparison

[Scratch Chorus]:

"Don't compare me to you, you ain't this" - Malice 'What Happened To That Boy'
