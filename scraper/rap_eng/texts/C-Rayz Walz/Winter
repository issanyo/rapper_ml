I'LL SIT WHERE JACK FROST OLD CADILLAC HOLD PROPS
FIREPICKED TO SPIT FOR NEW CHIPS OFF THE OLD BLOCK
SITTIN ON THE DOCK OF THE SPRAY
ROCKIN A SHELLCASE
STOPPAGE IN MY HELL STATE
WINTER SOLSTICE PACE
MY LOWEST POINTS SLOW SPACE
AND UNDERSTAND SPEED
LIKE IF THE GLOVE DON'T FIT
AQUIT THE FREAZY FREAKY
A TAD BIT TORENTIAL
TUNDRAS TAME THE ASTHMA
THEN MY LOSES INCREASE
DUE TO THE WIN-CHILL FACTOR
THE PEN SPILL CRACKED THE ICE AND KILLED SKATERS
THE COLD STEEL WAS IF YOU WANTED SOMETHIN ILL LATER
EXTRA CHAMBERS FOR CHALLENGERS WITHOUT A WARM SCARF
BLIZZARDS BANG THUNDER CATS
BETTER WARN SNARF
IT'S BRICK OUTSIDE
SO WE BUILDING ON THE AIR
DROPPING JEWELED MOLECULES
FLOW H20 SQUARED

HOOK
This is Hell Frozen Over
Try'na stay Sober
In a Barren Wasteland w/ no Coat on my Shoulders
Trees w/ no Leaves
Grey Skies Diseased
Coughin up Dough Just to Pay for The Heat
Noone ever "Bless You"
Less they catch when you Sneeze
Cabins on The Beach filled w/ Habits that they Need
Passion in The Pattern Gather Data from my Speech
Make ya Teeth Chatter like no Jacket in The East
