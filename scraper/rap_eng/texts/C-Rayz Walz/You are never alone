And frankly there is nothing so unusual about being a Jewish cowboy

Cowboy
I'm a cowboy
On a trail to nowhere all i have is a horse
Even he who could lead if he broke free of this
Curse
All i got memories they aren't even mine
In the drag when wails till the song has gone away

At night i look to the stars
Will they say kaddish for me
At night i look to the stars
Will they say kaddish for me

Cowboy
I'm a cowboy

As i ride just a road the journey of my life
Through the world with no love
I stop and wonder why
As i come to a town and lay my saddle down
Then i turn want some peace
But theres nowhere to be found

Ride like a tumbleweed, rollin' free
At night i look to the stars
Thats when i heard someone scream to me
You are on your own
At night i look to the stars
Will they say kaddish for me

This is straight from the horses mouth
We are buried treasure
Rag of bones traveled on graveled
Car battled on drugged for ever ever

This is straight from the horses mouth
We are buried treasure
Rag of bones traveled on gravel
Car battled on drugged for ever ever

Bounty on ma head spurs on your feet
We are out-of-towners the county
Gives us grief
On iron horses we gallop at light speed
New sheriff from town
I still think of description
Till they stressing me doing like ashtrays
What they clever maintain
Cos am chosen like hieroglyphic inscriptions
To be decoded by those who ain't frozen

Cowboy
I'm a cowboy

Now theres no tomorrow
Only yesterday
To live in the past
Is to ride your life away

I can flee in ma bones
I will die all alone
Back down to the ground
Of the siege brush wait for me

Ride like a tumbleweed, rollin' free
At night i look to the stars
Thats when i heard someone scream to me
You are on your own
At night i look to the stars
Will they say kaddish for me

Cowboy
You are never alone
I'm a cowboy
You Are Never Alone
