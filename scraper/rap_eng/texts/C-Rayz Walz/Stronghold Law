[Intro: Female Speaker and L.I.F.E. Long]
[Female Speaker]
Yo, check out the website: breezevahflowin.com
[L.I.F.E. Long]
Mr. Lawson.  Haha.  DJ [?].  Haha.  Shoutout to Wiz.  Stronghold.  Haha.  Yo.  Setting it off like... yo.  Just like, yo

[Verse 1: L.I.F.E. Long]
Challenges made amongst those for speaking out of turn
Silence.  Shushing you.  You my child—your mom knows my sperm
On some other.  Don’t screw up your face
With lips twisted like a sour lemon taste
Stay in your place.  Mine is always the same at top
Stronghold.  Making our way up from the bottom
The masses, I got ‘em off my swings, sock ‘em and knock them
Now you’re waking hazed, dazed
[More?] slipped after my mental was cocked back, then I released vocal sprays
This is a bloodbath.  Caused by my word splash.  Publishing all that
My joint ain’t going out unless you got the seed sack.  The royalties?  I need that
Keeping warm in cold temperatures, styling well in a North Face shell
See me out of state, conjuring up papes, slinging them CDs and tapes
My spitting missile should be OC.  I drop two L’s on cats’ steez

[Verse 2: Breez Evahflowin’]
Now catch Breez, the back shatterer, brain cell matter splatterer
From-out-the-dreams character and North America’s
Most fierce predator.  Bad review?  Nose-pierce your editor
With six foot syllabies and metaphors
I go plat, my head’ll soar straight through the ozone
My dogs be wiling even after smacks on the nosebone
Nuclear nose cone blowing up your ho’s phone
The post-phone, your booty call chewing the balls
I want it all like, “Allow me to be.”  Niggas suck.  Be discreet
When you speak and keep that bullshit off the streets
Broke a beast more potent than the pulpit and priest
With your nose on my toes, nigga, you smelling defeat/the feet
Stand on your block, puff an L on your streets, polly with me
So if we possibly leap, I’ll have the stats on how probably sweet you is
Papi beats his kids, son
Blowing up your cypher like when motherfucking pigs come

[Verse 3: Poison Pen]
Yo, Poison Pen, Stronghold 3.  Cross me
See bloodshed like I [move through the bush?] and Bruise with Brody
Cross seas, y’all pay me what ya owe me
Word to my stylers who said, “[?], Jabroni”
Mr. Lawson, DJ [?] get it on and make their name for this
I knew we’ve been there before
Faxes and emails, answer machines and cellphones
[The Polo?] nice, nigga.  I told y’all
“We rhyme into a sea shell, throw it in the ocean
That’s how we get our overseas hip hop devotion”
[Word, them shooters?] approaching
We second, third, fourth, and fifth that emotion
Saw us on other vision or the flow now.  Stronghold it down
Put my dick in your mouth until the swelling go down
Lékan smoke the heroin in the Ablerex
Leave y’all [south?] fucking hepatics impaled on a bayonet

[Verse 4: Stelf Index]
Technic, we blast like nickel-plated death
Technically driving baseline, breeze bassline
Perforated-edge MC—we rip easy
Pierce eardrums, insert diamond dum dums
Check and blast dead
Result: lady with lockjaw, no head
Sign of the times.  Out my mind
‘Cause I stay on yours—mental impression, verbal expression
Lessons in your wife’s seeing eye before a tape ejection
Put “Yes” on your ego
You’re light in the eyes like anal probe
Flow travel—foreign oasis
And ain’t find shit
Same story, different [?]
I wreck shit—totally expected
EA Sports, BGM by B FM
No BM.  Just empty A in ATM
Cash machine broke, split even with eight friends
Comprehend many claim rich—that’s pretend
Impeached president—honey drip, ladies and gentlemen
Hypnotize box like, “Let’s do it again”
C-Rayz Walz, Breez, L.I.F.E., Poison Pen
Index make five.  Stronghold, perfect ten
Stronghold Five make perfect ten
Hold this shit, “Biyaitch!”

[Verse 5: C-Rayz Walz]
Oh, what luck.  You duck into uppercut, you dumb fuck
On the brain, I’m off the chain like deformed nunchucks
Stronghold chop pods with a harvest blade
You pussies get slayed when I open up my coat like Morris Day
Which part we say?  “Keep running”
Like I’m racing my nose, erasing my foes gunning, stunning
Obeying the Lawson/law, son, mister
I’ll kiss your sister.  Blow the spot like Firecracker Twister
DJ [?] got weird movie snacks
Lungs collapse, turn black from mic booby trap
Explosive DAT, corrosive blacks
We got the underground shook like Jax, Mortal Kombat
Impact leaves cats hunchback
[Dumb back?] stacks.  You need to make me scream
Now I put the .45 to your chest like AC Green
I don’t have a computer—my thoughts is the laptop
I got Kodak fingers, killing crowds in snapshots
Stronghold “Hok2” in your eye with that
DJ Lawson, DJ [?], coast to coastal
Borders.  Vocals approach you
Stronghold

[Outro: C-Rayz Walz and Female Speaker]
[C-Rayz Walz]
Stronghold
[Female Speaker]
Heads are recording this when you hear this noise
