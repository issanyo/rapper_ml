[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
Thinking long range like radar brains for airplanes
My thoughts is sharp—with my art, I tear frames (You fear flames)
I walk through hell and maintain
Flashback to the pain like memory lane (Left stains)
But nothing too deep to explain
I exchange like Armani, politicin' this Jumanji
I thank Gandhi, calmly… huffing the brown, humpin' around like Bobby
Spitting something in these Bronx lobbies
Suede be Wally.  Using my words to catch bodies
Blaze the party like the magazine last paid.  Presently
Cutting a hole in the future with the past
Splash players, get you dazed like hash and haze
C-Rayz in the maze of any beat [I blaze?]
Bullets ricochet, modern day slaves get grazed
The time you save’ll be your own space in the grave
I skip the line ‘cause chances is slim these days
Like food when the stringyheads lived in the cage
Get red, I’ll part your Black Sea like half-moon fades
Running game like a Sony PlayStation with legs
My personal plague presented perfectly in a phase
Spreads like Dijonnaise and y’all heroes get slayed
Rampage with the poisonous phrase
I’ll break a Arm, Leg, a Leg, Arm, and Head on stage

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
All I’m given is thanks and praise
When its war, I’m spitting shanks and flames, grenades, tanks, and rage
My brigade invades those who can’t see past the daze
Get ‘em stuck where they at [?] I stash my [?]
Splash to the top of my brain
Providence pain while I raid the airwaves
Everglade re-reflect the rays, cheers like I stepped on stage at Live Aid
Like your brain on crack, this is my flame on track
I’m Bomb Jack.  Actual fact, knowledge my stats
Old school raps, contact with hemophiliac
The cypher’s a wild hurricane blasting gats
I’m a slim cat, but my production’s fat
Who put the Plain on Pat?  Well, y’all got [the Prozac?]
You feel impact.  But I ain’t gotta aim no gat
I’m hip hop—manifesting myself through rap
My personal plague presented perfectly in a phase
Spreads like Dijonnaise and y’all heroes get slayed
Rampage with the poisonous rays
I’ll break a arm, leg, a leg, arm, and head on stage

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
Make decisions.  Earthquakes when we flipping
I’ll go to hell if I put the clip in.  Then my brain start dipping
‘Cause it’s fire where I’m living
Lane-switching, pain-sicken, plain wisdom, crane kickin'
They face spitting.  Focus on the fact and the fiction
Playing my position—get in where I fit in
I writing good now—past tense: good writtens
Teeth-shattering shit when bitten
Yo, we from the dead, risen.  Cooking hot shit in Hell’s Kitchen
Bisque is in the oven, but I smell kittens
Jail-splitting conditions expose your inside visions
Some who go to prison start living
Stay sinning, endure harsh conditions (“Nah’mean?”)
But if you to start to listen and embark the mission
You’ll see centuries way past the ending (“Nah’mean?”)
Thinking long range, maintain and keep winning (“Gotta maintain”)
