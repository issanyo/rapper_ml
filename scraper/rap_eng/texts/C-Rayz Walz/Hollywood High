[Intro:]
*Laughing*
It's all about it...
????
????
And she came to my crib
I asked her to come in
And I introduced her to...

[Hook:]
Volume X
Weed and sex
Mollies coke, Percocets
Mushroom, pills, hotels next
Bath salt in the Jacuzzi, shorty wanna have sex

Nick Nolte
Eddie Murphy
Darryl Strawberry
John Candy
Clinton split bills
Whitney got paid
Charlie Sheen still winnin' the day

[Bridge 1:]
What the fuck is this man? I can't see! JESUS!

[Verse 1: Nutso]
I'm a beast though, kilos of perico, mixed with the ???
Looking out her peep-hole, shotty in my hand
I don't understand
My peoples fucked up, I'm about to shoot my man!
I'm p-noid as fuck, I'm hallucinating
Watchin' pornos bitch, I love masturbating
Cummin' on her face, the bitch fell asleep
She been awake for 2 days, the bitch O.D
Shoutouts to the addicts, fuck a rehab
I love doing drugs, follow me let's relapse
Re-Up killed the block, had a good flow
Even undercover Feds got hooked on the dope
Nutso the pusha man, slash alcoholic
Bar fights, breaking ice, central booking toilet
Crack game wack, my pockets is fat
I love drug money, watch my blood niggas stack

[Hook]

[Bridge 2:]
I'm itchin' so bad, MY GOD!

[Verse 2: C-Ray Walz]
????
????
I'ma wild boy, straight street Steve-O
Case the place, for that Rob Base cake
Lil Kim shit, I CAN'T FEEL MY FACE
Never a dry spell, I stay wet
My block got real rats, rocks, and gats
Drunk off pussy, stuck in a cave
Cut like Michael Myers, OH BEHAVE!

[Verse 3: AG da Coroner]
Lindsay Lohan was sniffin' that good shit
Amy Winehouse ?????
The '86 Mets inhaled the whole bird
Heath Ledger died nigga that's my word
A-Rod cheated and shot them big 'roids
Bobby got hooked and sold the kids toys
Pookie got clean but went back to the rocks
Would've still been alive if he ain't fuck with the cops
Tony killed Manolo, that nigga was skied up
Snoop killed his verse and rolled the weed up
Ari Gold flipped and chewed a whole 'shroom
There's some strippers O.D'd in their dressing room

[Hook]

[Outro: Nutso]
I'ma beast though, I'ma I'ma beast though
I'ma beast though, I'ma I'ma beast though
I'ma beast though, I'ma I'ma beast though
I'ma beast though, I'ma I'ma beast though
