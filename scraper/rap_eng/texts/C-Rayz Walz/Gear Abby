[Verse 1]
I'm Unlimited—my style's Ecko
I got a Stronghold on my threads and can't let go
Yo Laron.  You know why I'm fresh, yo
Of course you do, but here's my letter
You'll get jumped by fifteen spirits—I'm Triple 5 Soul
It all started when my man L said, "Yo!
I like your energy.  I know you got an ill flow
Just call me up next time you got a show."
Shout out to T, Nick, Mac, Red, O
Camilla, Chris, and the rest of the staff I know
I design like Kevin Long, create flavor
I'm a Goonie on a mission, a truth sayer
I stack arms.  My bullshit stay on the Phat Farm
My snorkel collar up like the hip hop Fonz
I'm a Lion King living in a Scar city
But I'll still score cause I play for varsity
I swear my head's nappy like my gear truly
Wack emcees wanna sue me, take Walz to Judge Judy
Stronghold—you know how we do: no delay
I stand out in the crowd like [styles of an EJ?]
Mass Appeal in my briefcase, rocking each state
I take out music then hike to Crystal Lake
I'm like Chaka Zulu drinking a big brew
Please no beat biting and that means your crew
So when I look good, you look good too
And the way I rock the crowd, I make 'em wanna rock you
I must show respect where respect is due
Gear Abby and that means you

[Outro]
Gear Abby, thank you (x3)
"Yo Walz, that shit looks hot!"
Thank you
