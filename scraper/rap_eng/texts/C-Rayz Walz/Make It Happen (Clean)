[Intro: C-Rayz Walz]
Ha.  Now come on.  Now come on.  Now let’s do it

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
Do it right (Right).  Left to right (Right)
Keep it hype (Hype) all night (Night)
Make it happen (Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Live your life)
Make it happen (Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Live your life)

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
Don’t talk about it—be it.  Get it if you see it
Whether drunk or sober or immensely weeded, believe this
From the floor to the door, go for yours—don’t be retreating
Meaning, “Get the fuck up!”  Even if you take a beating
For the life I’m leading, I could get a felony, cuz
I don’t like Bills like Hilary or Bellamy
Switched like Medina in Philly with a cheesesteak
My rollerblades cost one dollar—I’m a cheapskate
Make it happen, captain.  This is Musical Chairs
The beat stop, son, and now your spot ain’t there
Your plan failed.  What’s worse?  You failed your plan
All you did was talk about it to the next man and
I hustle, get big muscles without going to jail
Get success.  Nobody loves you when you fail
You want to get felt?  Become braille, balance the scales
Life’s a track.  Spark the action, be the third rail

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
Do it right (Right).  Left to right (Right)
Keep it hype (Hype) all night (Night)
Make it happen (Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Live your life)
Make it happen (Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Live your life)

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
I’m always at the right club at the right time
Knowing the right promoters (Go left), skip the right line
A quick pat-down.  Now I’m right inside
And if Pat’s down, I’m right on stage, ripping the rhyme
Throw your hands in the sky, make cloud disappear
Whether your Timbs are scuffed or there’s blings in your ear
Uh.  Live the day and you could make this your year
‘Cause the time is now, the place is here
In the 4th Pyramid was the party—(Bam!)—here it is
Explosive like science experiments
From the back, shorty’s bags packed like groceries
Get them beads of sweat around my neck like rosaries
You ain’t a thug.  You bugged off the drug’s reaction
Acting like you’ll get to clapping to make it happen
Just smack, lay back like slashing in the rain
Don’t say jack unless it’s their music—you passing the pain

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
Do it right (Right).  Left to right (Right)
Keep it hype (Hype) all night (Night)
Make it happen (Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Live your life)
Make it happen (Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Live your life)

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
I’m the starving artist formerly known as
The brother on the block you would have to loan some cash
I made it happen on the river of life
Moving rapid, born ripping the mic
From the old school—I always skipped class
To plant seeds in the Earth while I played on her grass
It takes one to dance, two to tango
I like fruit.  Honey fresh, look like mango
Life is funny, but I’m dead-serious when I laugh
Underground lines like Jersey that stay on path
You can’t make it happen if you sit on your ass
Life is full of traffic—get past it, don’t crash
Grab the steering wheel or I’ll beat your ass
What you doing now, man?  Forget about your past
Make it happen today ‘cause it might be your last
You see what I’m doing now—you don’t have to ask

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
Do it right (Right).  Left to right (Right)
Keep it hype (Hype) all night (Night)
Make it happen (Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Live your life)
Make it happen (Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Live your life)

[Outro: C-Rayz Walz]
Yeah, yeah.  (Living life).  Uh.  I feel that.  (Make it happen).  Live your life.  Make it happen.  (Live your life).  Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Yeah.  Uh huh.  Do it.  Uh huh.  Yeah.  Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Make it happen.  Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Do it.  Right, left—go ahead.  Make it happen
