[Intro: Money Carson and (C-Rayz Walz)]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Money Man, C-Rayz, Yak, and the Green.  (They have arrived) Straight off the Lincoln Tunnel.  (The fame) Live and in the flesh (Give me your wallet).  Pause that.  Uh, yeah (Yo, yo, yo, Rhyming Hood)

[Verse 1: Money Carson and C-Rayz Walz]
[Money Carson]
My inner thoughts like
Constant, one of the best, bullseye
Type of archer—partner, one to your chest
Money puffing the Lucy.  I’m into loot, see
Camelot canned in tree ash and taxes
Rob from the rich, style feeding my team
[C-Rayz Walz]
I seen God from the cliff while breathing the green
In the rainforest, I train hardest.  Untame artist
Fire-breathing madman with a plan to flame markets
As I stick up scripts, this is a Stone Hedge mage
Constructing the category of chaos on page
[Money Carson]
I jumpstart the rage.  Therefore, whatever you’re here for
We could flare force for the God and state
Up the NY, test mine
[C-Rayz Walz]
I’ll scar your face
Guard your plate, lacerate garden snakes
Scalping your wig.  Rotten Apple out the mouth of the pig
Plot and tackle.  Yeah, you know what it is
Rhyming Hood

[Hook: Money Carson and C-Rayz Walz]
[Money Carson]
We’re
Pursuing jewels, woke the wolves
In a hood where you get forced to fall, we
Rise up
[C-Rayz Walz]
‘Cause sleep is the cousin of stupid
Put your life on a track and loop it.  Rhyming Hoods
[Money Carson]
We’re
Pursuing jewels, woke the wolves
In a hood where you get forced to fall, we
Rise up
[C-Rayz Walz]
‘Cause sleep is the cousin of stupid
Put your life on a track and loop it

[Verse 2: Gino Green and Kon Yak]
[Gino Green]
Yo
I’m taxing four hundred off of your brick.  This is mili-
-tary black shot, extortioner shit.  I’ll take you for thirty
Thou and a brown bag.  While we’re talking, you’re six
Our six larceners.  Bitches aren’t tricks.  Organize and
Navigate numerous licks.  Hoes, barbeques, and
Buffets and the bricks.  I’ll stick dice games and wrap the prize
Money for young mothers all week, flash the semi
For the chain with the heaviest drip (Kill, drip)
[Kon Yak]
The boy ready with a clip of them arrows
Fitted Timbs and black tees, circle apparel
It’s really nothing.  Yak bad to the marrow
I’m a steady jewel dropper.  Keep your eyes on the barrel
And J-Zone here to bring the paper home
[?] like the Lakers zone
Flow is splendid.  Whip, yeah, I rimmed it
But still in the jungle with more green intended

[Hook: Money Carson and C-Rayz Walz]
[Money Carson]
We’re
Pursuing jewels, woke the wolves
In a hood where you get forced to fall, we

[Verse 3: Money Carson, Kon Yak, Gino Green, and C-Rayz Walz]
[Money Carson]
I’ll rep
Hostile, live life running the ash
The kid spot you.  Gossip, one in the head
Nowadays, women run to the Feds and I’ma come deep
In it for the money alone like J-Lo be
[Kon Yak]
Tap Yak two-way—page can’t fold me
Rats had AKs like they [?]
That cat want to act and now he’s sorry
Dog, that’s the end of the story (True story)
[Gino Green]
I touch
Athletes and rappers when it come to Saint Nick
And kick back with trap money.  Hoes get at they pimp
No chorus, paying for it quick.  I got Wayne Perry
Listen if you getting it kid (This is it)
[C-Rayz Walz]
Phlegm from the dungeon, automatic static from attics
Cats [?] when I [?] apart shells, magic
This is hell’s fabric, the spell graphic.  We sell
Caskets.  Don’t make us snatch your baskets, faggots

[Hook: Money Carson and C-Rayz Walz]
[Money Carson]
We’re
Pursuing jewels, woke the wolves
In a hood where you get forced to fall, we
Rise up
