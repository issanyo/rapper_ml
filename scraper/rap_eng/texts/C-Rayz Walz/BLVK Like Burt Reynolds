(Sample)
"All my massive, gotta get with it."

(Sample)
"I don't want n***az sounding like me, on no album."

Listen to the rhyme, listen to the beat..It's cool
I had to fight cause I brought hummus to school
I was vegetarian, then in 2000 shit became cool
I'm like what the fuck they can't stop me
I had to fuck people up to eat my broccoli
Now everybody wants a motherfucking salad
The bullet or the ballad
I'm like Malcom X on the step it's a mini me
Vs. the person who spit bars at Kennedy
Allah symmetry transition to Jesus Christ
Biggie or Pac? It don't matter, he's just nice
It's the season I motivate with light
It's the reason why you hear me on the mic so hype
With my blonde thing.. Cause I do the mic something dirty
You heard me, like Don King

(CHORUS)
I want a mustache damn it!Like Burt Reynolds
Like Burt Reynolds, Like Burt Reynolds..

I must splash canvas, your bus pass ran it
On a concourse stuck like fuck mass transit
I buck blast answers, what black antlers?
Man vs. Wild, I'll eat a muskrat sandwich
When I'm online don't be a fucking bass scammin'
Fuck that blam him, crush that salmon
Pardon my french or my rough ruck manners
"********?" What? That's just bad Spanish
Tweet, tweet my beat skeet on your songs
I be street in the sheets with your moms.. real talk!
I'm being funny, but yo it's like money: I come and I go
The root of all evil, I know
My He Man'd get "****?" to smoke
One shot pops tequila and quote
Fire hut stop dropping and roll, my spit give me props like Ramone
How am I gonna go pop holmes? Pop was never home!

(CHORUS)
I want a mustache damn it!Like Burt Reynolds
Like Burt Reynolds, Like Burt Reynolds..

(Sample)
" I put two hands together like twelve o'clock"

(Sample)
" We rock for ourselves, we don't need no fans
But if you're in the place to be, let me see your hands"
