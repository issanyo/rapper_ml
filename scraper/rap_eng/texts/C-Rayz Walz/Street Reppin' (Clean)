[Verse 1: Vordul Mega]
From hard
Times, write lines for ones we lost
Songs stressed, full of kids with pagers and gold
Crosses, living without a pot to piss in
Coming out of cribs to live in obstacles of hard decisions
Tired of hoping and wishing.  Witness
Brothers make a living pushing cokes out the kitchen
Though we suffered watching each other
In and out of institutions, losing our shahada
While girls complaining they dudes ain’t copping
‘Em Prada, me and mine skate dramas
Puffing L’s late nights with hunger
In front of Mama Fry, munching on chicken
And peach cobblers.  Times when I was in and out
Of dungeons for dolos.  No fears of getting
Robbed even though we know anything could
Happen.  My folks telling me I need to make
Changes like, “It’s best to sticks to the rapping”
So I’m over here, snapping my fingers
To keep to beats.  Flowing over instrumental
Tracks and still got love for streets

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz and Vordul Mega]
Who wanna
Jump quick?  Yo, how high?  How
High?  Do or die?  Who am I?
Brothers is doing ‘em.  Who is him?
We Mega, street repping.  Who wanna
Jump quick?  Yo, how high?  How
High?  Do or die?  Who am I?
Brothers is doing ‘em.  Who is him?
We, we Mega, street repping

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
Ready to pump CDs.  Not for the
Ice—just to keep produce up in the freezer
Fire it up in the clubs.  People keep
Filling their cups like they’re drinking for Jesus (How high?)
Be fly ‘til I turn to a bird, same
Way these thoughts turn into word (Justice).  I’m just
Nice, roll with brothers that’s just ice, hungry
For a week, deep, eating smushed rice.  Mind straight
Pull strings violent, pimp you without Ben-Ari
A Puerto Rican Muslim, I’ve been aquí.  You could
Take it as left wig or right hair/here.  Never fight
Fair, fresh like a new pair... got you
Study discipline at the master’s pace (Yo, who wanna)
(Jump quick?).  Drops of water’ll slash your face
The Trinity of street humor and spiritual fact
Politically charged statements with rhythm on wax

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz and Vordul Mega]
Who wanna
Jump quick?  Yo, how high?  How
High?  Do or die?  Who am I?
Brothers is doing ‘em.  Who is him?
We Mega, street repping.  Who wanna
Jump quick?  Yo, how high?  How
High?  Do or die?  Who am I?
Brothers is doing ‘em.  Who is him?
We, we Mega, street repping

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz and Vordul Mega]
[C-Rayz Walz]
Caught up in the cultivation, cold sensation of cul-
-tured patience, coping to coach a nation of mad souls
In the Year of the Beast, I’m ten-deep in the street, repping
Holding my head like a weapon concealed—I’m a mad soul
New York needs a coat this winter.  Cold-hearted pigs
Get bacon trying to poke my ninjas.  Po-lices is
Trifest in crisis.  We writing the slaughter, sort of
Sicker than mixing liquor with Vitamin Water
Horror at your fetus.  Holler back if you a genius
Ayatollah sees the truth ‘cause they believe us.  In the crowd
With heaters, remove the shroud.  The vow-keeper
Switch styles.  Fouls astound seekers.  Prowl
Profound teachers, I was eager.  I mean, I...
[Vordul Mega]
I learned a lot coming out of burning blocks
Time to turn the clock forward to better ways
Of getting paid.  Days when everything seemed
[?].  Got to change ‘cause the grains
Of sands accumulating quickly at the bottom
And the pain is getting out of hands.  Now I
Gotta stand on my two and pay dues

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz and Vordul Mega]
Who wanna
Jump quick?  Yo, how high?  How
High?  Do or die?  Who am I?
Brothers is doing ‘em.  Who is him?
We Mega, street repping.  Who wanna
Jump quick?  Yo, how high?  How
High?  Do or die?  Who am I?
Brothers is doing ‘em.  Who is him?
We, we Mega, street repping
