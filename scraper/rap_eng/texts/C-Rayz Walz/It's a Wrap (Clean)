C-Rayz Walz - “It’s a Wrap”
[Emcee(s): C-Rayz Walz]
[Producer(s): Ishi and Onedread]

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
It's a wrap when I attack, crash the door
It's a wrap.  This track ready to splash Billboard
It's a fact: I'm what y'all was waiting for
I'm plat', but still hardcore
It's a wrap.  If you’re wack, don't spit no more
It's a wrap.  My hot tracks’ll bring it to y'all
Come on, scream ‘til your throat is sore
Get off the wall, rush the dance floor

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
I'm the urban legend in true form with a goose on
Hottest artist alive.  No jive, you lukewarm
Talk like walk—with a suit on.  Stalk like
Hawks—my thoughts swoop and move on.  Glide like
Clyde, crazy like Ali's nemesis.  Ecko
Tight, write—my pen proves Unlimited.  Plot
Like my penmanship hit the curb—flip the words like
Aikido.  I got this in a wrap like fajita
Make my voice span, Pan like Peter
In el barrio, spitting bars like, "¡Mira!"
Split your cap like baseball pitchers.  I'm sick
Of rap!  In fact, I hate y'all niggas
'88 hip hop like, "Kill a ‘Sucker M.C.’"
When he fake like a Pulitzer me, it's a wrap.  Lines
Like these smash your embassy hard.  If it's
A game, I'm snatching your memory card

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
It's a wrap when I attack, crash the door
It's a wrap.  This track ready to splash Billboard
It's a fact: I'm what y'all was waiting for
I'm plat', but still hardcore
It's a wrap.  If you’re wack, don't spit no more
It's a wrap.  My hot tracks’ll bring it to y'all
Come on, scream ‘til your throat is sore
Get off the wall, rush the dance floor

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
When it's a wrap, y'all cats get buried alive
For years like the careers of the Jackson 5
The Sun Cycle spits heat like gun rifles
You ain't ready to score like a young Michael
My rebuttal to your waste of space is a NASA
Shuttle fate.  Me and the stars correlate
Where only the core relate.  In other words
I'm the asteroid belt to your waste/waist of space
When I rock the house like avalanches in your crib
And write/right hook like boxers aiming for rib
There’s a war going on—I'm training the kids
Like Markie, I stay connected to my Biz
KRS rep the Bronx, Shane still repping The Bridge
Kane's still the god.  Like Rakim, my lesson to give:
C-Rayz, the brand new weapon it is.  Fact:
I'm "Paid in Full.”  You “Half-Steppin'” again

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
This is
Miami Vice rap—diamond bunion.  Jacking
Your face, making you cry—praise the onion
Sixteen bars should get you drunk thirty-two times
Then you find I double up when I write rhymes
I might battle, then war like White Shadows
In the "Eye of the Tiger,” who want to fight Drago?
On Rocky roads, I hike gravel.  The Sun Cycle
Mic unravels and light travels.  Life is
The Playoffs—anything can happen but
You’re sure to lose your spot if you’re slacking, cuz
You lose all your profit from copping jewels.  So
Stuck-up, your shit could be used for rocket fuel.  I got
Talent, but that's apparent.  The way I give
Birth to hits, I should be a parent
I'll kill you at the end of the game like, "Good try
But you are the weakest link. Goodbye!"

It's a wrap.  My hot tracks’ll bring it to y'all
Come on, scream ‘til your throat is sore
Get off the wall, rush the dance floor
