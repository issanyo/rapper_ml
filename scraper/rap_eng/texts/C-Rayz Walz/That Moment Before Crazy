[Vast Aire]
Oh, oh you ain't, you ain't know you was gonna see me?
Shit, I'm the Sun Ra of this shit

[Hook: Sharkey & Vast Aire]
You gotta go
Hide out, whatever keep low
(Look at them dudes, they some scaredy cats)
You gotta run
Get back to momma's gun, whoah
(Don't just stand there; you better point that)

[C-Rayz Walz]
When my blood boils, I gotta watch the pot
Thinking inside the box
Monkey see, monkey do
Barrel and pop
Bannana brain baboon lives
Bamboo shoes, barbed wire barricades
In the belly of the beast
We'll hold the booth
Nose twitch, hair stand up
Teeth grit, and what?
You in a cage with lions
Tigers, dragons, and panthers
A vibrant wave
We're riding Poseidon's trident
Incites the wizardess
Blowing the whistle
Off the man who was kettle
Sensible bliss
The violent ventriloquist
Ventricle raw
If I vick your jaw
Then my fist is paws
All this because
You wanna see animals manifest
When I rest on planet stress
Instead of clapping the toes
I keep gravity close, so

[Hook]

[Vast Aire]
Alright
Give me the key to the city
I get 'em good
I got a gold nameplate
That says "I wish you would,"
You should turn around
Matter fact
You should change your nouns
How's your ego look?
It's so underground
Right-handed I'm on the mound
In rap life, I'm ten feet
And a thousand pounds
You shouldn't clash the sound
I'll drop a bucket of raps
That will make you drown
That's why I never gave a pound
If I gotta chase you
I'll let loose the hounds
You won't have no worries
When you're underground
I'm a Buddhist
You can have nirvana now

[Hook]

[Hook 2: Sharkey]
In this house of cards
You're gonna breathe too hard, bring it down

[Vast Aire]
Don't you ever in your life
Test the gods
I will huff and puff
On your house of cards
You think this is a game?
It's more like the moment
Before "Cuckoo" is your name
You gotta go
Hide out, whatever dude
You can't breathe so hard
At this altitude

[C-Rayz Walz]
You know we spaz out and go Citizen Kane
You Dorothy and Lois Lane in a hurricane
Sharkey, Walz, & Vast
We in the machine
You should get them car keys
Out them denims and speed, cause

[Hook 1 & Hook 2]
