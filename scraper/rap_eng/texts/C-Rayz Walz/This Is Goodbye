[Hook: Sample from [?]] (x2)
So long, farewell
This is goodbye

[Interlude (Overlapped with Hook): C-Rayz Walz]
Adios.  See ya.  [?].  Peace.  Hey, hey, hey (Come on)

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
There’s no looking back.  You shook off the Brooklyn Ac’
I know what to do this summer: jux and dash
Just to dub over thug soldier mats
Metaphors have changed to gats and the music could slay the wack
Should you waste battery juice with picture-frame plots
Oscar the Grouch or shit-stain straps
Black is funky.  For a Will Tell track, I’m a junkie
Smack lava flames out the game
Make tigers jump through fire loops on gold chains
We ain’t do it on purpose.  The purpose: we do it
Is to troop through Brooklyn more stupid
It’s over!

[Hook: Sample from [?] and (C-Rayz Walz)]
So long, farewell
This is goodbye (Aaah!)

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
This is the end of days like no work for slaves
Everybody in the house and master in the grave
My tech O.B.S., Nikon with a Krylon
Guzzle a python and spit venom
Trife form like swift, ninja clothesline sidearm
Family relied on ‘til I’m gone
[?] a guy.  Then ask the pastor why
I’mma go to hell when I say, “Goodbye”

[Hook: Sample from [?] and (C-Rayz Walz)]
So long, farewell (Hehehe.  Adios)
This is goodbye (See ya.  Yeah.  Yo)

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
You get dazed when injure stage
Find the adjectives LP in a ninja blade magazine
Tragic scene, rapper fiends
Get you gassed up like gasoline
Simplistic, kill with intrinsic schemes
Plan A: this might be B/BB
Like ammo for airguns, you hear son?
Odds are evens—ain’t no fair ones
Beat kicks tears your eardrums
The bells that you hear are your own dizziness
See, we get busiest
You run like Kizzy, bitch
Now run quick.  It’s over—quit

[Hook: Sample from [?] and (C-Rayz Walz)]
So long, farewell (Adios)
This is goodbye (See ya)
So long, farewell
This is goodbye ([?].  [?].  Yo)

[Verse 4: C-Rayz Walz]
You cats is pitiful
Dogs barks’ll get at crews.  My whole squad’ll spit at you
This is the end.  Kiss the 9
Your [aims?] go, “Boom boom,” tracks collide
The end of days as I begin to blaze
We got big goals but we’ll send the strays
Let ‘em graze you.  Shook like pocketbooks
Got snatched.  After that, I’ll praise you
We raise the roof and drop the sky
Use halos to dot the eyes
We dropped the lines—you sniff ‘em up
The compilation will tell you what (What?!?)

[Hook: Sample from [?] and (C-Rayz Walz)]
So long, farewell (C-Rayz Walz.  Adios)
This is goodbye (Will Tell Compilation Part 2.  Keep your body close)
So long, farewell (Redemption of the Brooklyn Ac’)
This is goodbye (Practice, stupid.  Trooping through Brooklyn)
