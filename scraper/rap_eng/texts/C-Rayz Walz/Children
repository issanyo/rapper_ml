I Self Lord and Master
After the Rapture/
I feel like the Roc in a scene from FASTER/
In the House of the Lord/
Bout to Blast the Pastor/
They Killed Thy Brother/
What?
Passin a Basket/
My Hood is Which Crafted/
Every Scene is a Dry Spell/
But what do I know/
Well who Askin?
Shots Fired!/
Man Down/
It's Boys up/
Adults fear the Future/
So They Avoid us!
My Slang Bang w/ a Gang cuz My Family's Rough But/
I gotta be Hard cuz I've evolved from Tough Luck
This is Obviously Odd/
Getting Even is so much of a False Reality
I Seen Jesus & Got Drunk
& That's Just a 40 to the Head
Of the Kings English
& That's when Shorty Said.....

"IF THIS IS THE HIGH LIFE/
THEN I'M A DIE ON A FLY NOTE/
CUZ EVERYTHING I READ ONLY SEEN WHAT THE EYES QUOTE/"

VERSE 2
I'm not Mad My Old Dad got Popped in his Wig/
But That is why I'm adopting the Kids/
Where I live/
I'm Father Sky
& Remember the Time
When my kids was yo kids & Ya kids was mine/

If I Did some shit/ Ya Moms would beat my Behind/
Now Behind these Lines it's just Beats & Rhymes/
Or
Is it a Blizzard/ That just visits ya mind/
What you on Hop/
Dope Dog Food or Swine/
Sewage in The Music/
Who's Chewing The Lines/
The Same Kids doing the Crimes
But you on ya Grind Right?
Sell Out/
It's No Receipt
What You Call Success is The Children's Defeat!
My Slang Bang w/ a Gang cuz My Family's Stuck but/
I gotta be Hard cuz I've evolved from Tough Luck
This is Obviously Odd/
Getting Even is so much of a False Reality
I Seen Jesus & Got Drunk
& That's Just a 40 to the Head
Of the Kings English
& That's when Shorty Said

"IF THIS IS THE HIGH LIFE/
THEN I'M A DIE ON A FLY NOTE/
CUZ EVERYTHING I READ ONLY SEEN WHAT THE EYES QUOTE/"

I Learned From You
TO HAVE SEX AS A FAD
I Learned From You
TO LET MY PANTS SAG
I Learned From You
THAT GOD WAS CASH
I Learned From You
TO PUT MYSELF LAST
I Learned From You
HOW TO REPEAT THE PAST
WHAT TYPE OF LESSON IS THAT
MOM & DAD?
I Learned From You
THAT VIDEO GAMES IS COOL & LIFE IS JOKE W/ NO GOLDEN RULES
I DID WHAT YOU DID
WHAT YOU SAID CONFUSED
NOW I'M STUCK IN THIS COLD WORLD W/ TOOLS

"IF THIS IS THE HIGH LIFE/
THEN I'M A DIE ON A FLY NOTE/
CUZ EVERYTHING I READ ONLY SEEN WHAT THE EYES QUOTE/"

I need a Safe Space
While I Carry The Torch
W/ Equality
Outstanding Effort
Service to our Family & Friends
& Community
Staying In Tune w/ Within
Inspiration
Motivation of Deeds
Preparation, Activism
Commitment To Me
Teamwork
So Who Cares what I know
Cuz Everything I seen only read what the eyes quote
