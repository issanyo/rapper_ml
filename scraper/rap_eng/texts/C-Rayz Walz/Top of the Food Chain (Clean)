“Poison” - [?]
[Poison Pen]
Yo.  Yeah.  It’s like this.  Yo.  Check, check, yo.  Poison Pen.  Stronghold 3.  Yeah.  “Top of the Food Chain.”  It’s like this.  Yo.  Yo

[Verse 1: Poison Pen]
Poison Pen for you ballers and bammers
Walked up in the spot.  Metal detectors went bananas (Stronghold!)
It’s Bronx swinging—give me dap ‘til my palm stinging
Grab your bitch and make a porn feature
Come out your mouth?  That’s a nice shirt to bleed on
We only use your wax to fucking roll trees on (Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!)
You’re wack.  Your block and your street
Niggas so pussy, they don’t speak—they queef.  When we run shit
We Stronghold shit.  I need a chain I can jump rope with
And Bed Stuy got ‘em
Word, I’m like Zeus without the eye problem
Suge Knight without the bald spot
[?] landmarks is chicken spots
Even little tots got they eyes on your necklace
My life is this flick—y’all are extras
I dealt with more blocks than Tetris
We perfectionists
And wouldn’t have it any other way (Keep talking lip)
I’ll bend your knee the other way.  Niggas talking ‘bout schemes?
They never been to the out.  Fuck with me
Our comb break the skin on your scalp
Been in this too long to ask for help—I’m dolo
Can somebody tell these homos that they lost they mojo?
I’m like the jailhouse photo
With your fam, showing tats in the rap room
Cherish that for life
That’s what I put on my mic (Yeah!)

[Hook: Poison Pen]
Guzzling Easy Jesus while they squeezing ninas
You better?  Then please defeat us
Ladies just tease and squeeze us—they pleased to meet us
Top of the food chain and still chewing bottom feeders
My tongue mutilate modern English.  I’m from the sideway heaters
Always comment on your silent beepers
It ain’t no joke.  Baby, the bed is broke
Just holla out my window if you tryin’ to reach us

[Verse 2: Poison Pen and C-Rayz Walz]
[Poison Pen]
Sorry, I can’t help being rowdy
Walk up in the kitchen, nearly bump errybody
Sway to the left, flip a little.  Yo, my G’s too advanced
Children started flocking ‘cause they thought he was in dance
[?], son.  You know who we are
We might just try to play Saluchi with your car
[C-Rayz Walz]
Yeah, god.  We next to the bar like CEOs
And if you scheme, my team is sure to get you hit like free throws
You know how we go.  Patient at what we do
Hating on your PlayStation 2, yelling “[?]”
In the hood like most phones—off the hook
Out of order where a token equals six quarter waters
We push units.  What you move could get you petty life
In the game where niggas lose weight like Kelly Price
Strongholding.  "Shine" on every song chosen
“Hectic” when we roll through like avalanches
My snowmen cold ‘til it’s lights out
Or we like Eskimos with no house keys—iced out
[Poison Pen]
We don’t battle—we mic joust
Y’all dickheads don’t live in houses—y’all live a lifestyle
We tight, foul like uncle in your mom’s titty sauce
Seeing me’s one thing.  How you getting through war?  You getting fried
You get [rap?]—means I’m blacking your pretty eyes
[Pen’s fienders?].  You small bitch, I run up in your [?] ingenious

[Hook: Poison Pen]
Guzzling Easy Jesus while they squeezing ninas
You better?  Please defeat us
Ladies just tease and squeeze us—they pleased to meet us
Top of the food chain and still chewing bottom feeders
My tongue mutilate modern English.  I’m from the sideway heaters
Always comment on your silent beepers
It ain’t no joke.  Baby, the bed is broke
Just holla out my window if you tryin’ to reach us

Stronghold 5.  Check out the young kid.  “Top of the Food Chain.”  Strongholding.  Emvees [?].  And they rock like that.  Fakts One on the track.  Yeah
