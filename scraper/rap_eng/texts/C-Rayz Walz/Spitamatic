[Verse 1: Vordul Mega]
Blow trees on spots with no d's
Know these cops are so hungry to let the government
Gross g's off us in penitentiaries
Frustrated the only way to bust is mentally
From ghettos and meddle
Stay bopping the instrumental
The cops is cock blockin in front of spots
We off top switching the pedals
Aliens get sick in the middle
Got caught in it
With a little bit of the 'ism
In the city of villains
Spastic crouching tigers and hidden dragons
Niggas'll go spitamatic we flow spitamatic
For the head piece to get attracted
Burning red leaves to the cabbage
Learning dead ? niggas acting
We gonna get rapping
Till the streets cease the madness
Listening to the beat clapping and be happy stay so nappy
Poems that have to hold the gat piece
Just to get through
Feel like we gotta spit missiles
Just to get you to feel it in the physical
Reciprocate lyrical in fashions
Just to bash in your cranial cabinet
Metaphors
When words become hands to open doors
Open doors

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
Street journal
Put heat to your kernal and pop it
Everybody looking for profit
Im looking like a prophet
When the beats is pulsating
Most gracious
Niggas I roll with so satan
No playstation and no game
Thats the cereal ? scratched off no name
Plain killers stand by the freezer
With crews and dudes who scrooge like ebenezer
Pop bruise make you a believer
In vice we speed life hold dice roll with sativa
Wild style killer with dirt in the caesar
? face with metallica to roll the fever
We make you a believer
Where we from fights for ice by the freezer

[Hook]
Spitamatics
Mic addicts
With drug habits
Life tragic
They mind find you in a casket
You trying to grind
They trying to lock you like a savage
Haze with the hashes
Its all mathmatic
(x2)

[Verse 3: Vordul Mega]
Spitamatics from the high lands of manhatten
Get it pappen
Ninjas in the mix
Leave faces like "what happened?"
The night creatures
Either so streets clappin'
Noblemen on beats watching and just laughing
Gotta eat
The monsters reaction to the heat
To much on my girl crib hard to breathe
And can't sleep feeling addicted to cold streets
But must stay away
Harassed everyday by the fucking police
So we move disorderly with pants hanging off our asses
Spitting acid
Ever since we was young matches
Never listening to what moms asked us
We rather be on the street
Quest for skunk sessions
That cave pump niggas chest in
So how you restin'

[Verse 4: C-Rayz Walz]
Ring around the rosy be deciever
Gotta get your rolly face holding open for holy chiba
Pop shots pop locks scream heater cry wolf
Whisper phoenix
Digest readers
Death in the rear view I hear few
True thoughts closer
In any hood
Like a newport poster
If I tell you again I told you once
And thats word to the chinamen who sold ?front
Without you and ari latifa?
Bout to set it off
On the reaper to buy sneakers
Sit by the speakers and write this
Make the ? deeper
Roll it up start again
Check my beeper
'matic spitting the verbs
Showing the culture
Im done flipping the bird Im throwing the vulture
Random thoughts
Find their home in dome
Stoned is the way of the poem

Spitamatic
