[Intro: C-Rayz Walz]
Word.  On some one, two, three

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
Where there's a will there's a way.  No?
Where there's Will, there's Jada
I kiss, then piss in the face of a hater
Congratulate us at afterparties in heaven
Thank God my intro was peace to the 7's
Let's go!

[Hook: Natacha Elossaint]
Battle me so you can see (So you can see)
How I blast flows (Blast flows) so easily (So easily)
Battle me so you can see (So you can see)
How I blast flows (I blast flows) so easily (So easy for me)

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
I'm the foul author of styles out of order
I got skills—I could drown you with a cup of water
So don't waste my time with stupid questions like, "Ayyo, you rhyme?"
You don't need to hear my verse—you got enough on your mind
You work for who?!?  So?!?  I don't wanna get signed
My shadow's chasin' me—basically, I'm ahead of my time
I'm tryna get this green out the heat like spinach rolls
So don't make me put six in your Kenneth Cole
"Yo Walz, they hollerin' at you!"  In a minute, yo!
I'm tryna score points with the right hooks like Riddick Bowe
Battle me, don't challenge me with them simple styles
I'll have your crew sayin', "WHO!" like some Temple Owls
I'm like John Stockton—I don't even have to score
I just make the game better by bein' out there on the floor
So when you ice grill me, instead of breakin' your jaw
I think Fireballs in your face like a young Drew Barrymore
Come on!

[Hook: Natacha Elossaint]
Battle me so you can see (So you can see)
How I blast flows (Blast flows) so easily (So easily)
Battle me so you can see (So you can see)
How I blast flows (I blast flows) so easily (So easy for me)

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
Verses like these be bullets that speed and rush
While you the type to audition for "Eden's Crush"
I have a group, but they was like, "He's enough"
Okay.  I see the truth—y'all don't believe in us?
I'll be the proof.  Real emcees succeed and plus
I'm comin' through ya hood, bumpin' goods in the G's truck
You squeeze and bust?  Well, you probably poppin' a bump
I hope you catch Bucks like Milwaukee—what?!?
Too much players in the game make it hard to believe
When I got the ball, yo, follow me like a 3-man weave
Might go out to Tahoe—the Regime was Green
And I cut the iron off—y'all thought I lost some steam
You soft!  I'm not the type to force my dream
Of course I floss V.I.P. without no cream
Yo I got more lines than double dutch tournaments in Harlem
And if I ain't on your roster, your label got problems
Battle me!

[Hook: Natacha Elossaint]
Battle me so you can see (So you can see)
How I blast flows (Blast flows) so easily (So easily)
Battle me so you can see (So you can see)
How I blast flows (I blast flows) so easily (So easy for me)

[Verse 4: C-Rayz Walz]
Never been to México but got ki's from médico
Deep sea flow—peep my notes with periscopes
Police think I pump perico—that's for petty folk
Who don't know the science of the walk with the blade in his throat
Still strugglin', but I'm bubblin' to make it clearer
I ain't seein' myself in a house of mirrors
Times is good, but your moms is still in the hood
Stay on my tip and get splinters in ya lip from bitin' the wood
I'm not Santa's helper—I'm not rappin for free
Next time you step to C, I'm clappin' ya feet
Psycho visions—I hear voices.  Listen (Stop calling me!)
I feel like the Geico Lizard
Ayyo I'm spittin for real—gotta love that, kid
"Ayyo, C-Rayz Walz!"  Man, I love that kid
If you're fly, the sky flyin'—for real
I'm one of those things you could die tryin'
Buck if you battle me

[Hook: Natacha Elossaint]
Battle me so you can see (So you can see)
How I blast flows (Blast flows) so easily (So easily)
Battle me so you can see (So you can see)
How I blast flows (I blast flows) so easily (So easy for me)

[Outro: Natacha Elossaint]
So easy for me
So easy for me
It's so easy for me
People always tryna step, sayin' they are the best
But watch me break them down—that, they must confess
It's so easy for me
Oh ohh ohh
It's so easy for me
Oh ohh ohh ohh
