[Intro]
[Sample from ?]
“Now some people are saying that I’m crazy”
[C-Rayz Walz]
DJs and MCs.  Coming up next, the one and only incredible, yin and yang king.  Yo.  Grab the [rope?]

[Hook 1: C-Rayz Walz]
I’m in the house, y’all (Say what?)
I’m in the house, y’all (Say what?)
Yin and yang, C-Rayz—we in the house, y’all
I’m in the house, y’all (Say what?)
I’m in the house, y’all (Say what?)
This what the Sun Cycle be about, y’all (Say what?)

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
But I’m C-Rayz Walz from New York state (State)
My ancient style is what I proclamate (-mate)
When I demonstrate (-strate), it can’t be fake (Fake)
‘Cause I got sharp swords for the snakes
I kill the mic (Mic) and live the jam (Jam)
Give birth to word (Word) if you overstand (-stand)
Waive hands, change plans when you see my fam (Fam)
Stronghold, guest clan—on the mic, I am

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
Heed the word, unsee the herb
Find justice when the brother occured
Out the darkness with cups of light
Heaven and hell, day to the night
Travel the beats beyond
Time-warp souls to the Pantheon
Fight the demons, unchain the brain
See Jack run, complain to Jane
Rock fables, fables and joke
Not knowing you work for ghosts
The gulliest at the williest
In actuality, you’re just the silliest
Iceman coming—froze the stage
Unseen hand that turn the page
Who’s the author?  The rest of the Earth
Killah Priest says, “The last shall be first”
Soul-dead brothers’ points of view:
“Things Fall Apart”—check your roots
From niggas to gods I am
A [?]—the spirit of a man
The Last Poets have to build
Like great Scott-Heron with Gils
Uhuru, People Army for days
Your brother’s in the mist, bumrushing the stage
Test the Rayz—C-Walz for days
Behold the pale horse—grab the reigns
[?] papers make me look like Christ
[?] truth of life

[Bridge 1: C-Rayz Walz]
Vainglorious with the mic in the headlock and your neck on pop
This is that raw, certified yin and yang, Sun Cycle hip hop
Baller, player with the [?] missing, hitting the point like a obelisk in your third eye vision
This is protected by the Red, the Black, and the Green with the [?]
Sissy

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
I spin in space with mysterious swiftness
Make you clap ‘til your hands and wrists spit
Jump around, huff the paint, jump around, [?] [cords?]
Jump aroun, [?] head, jump around, spring foot
Hot in the kitchen—things cook and play hooky
You in the pot with peppers and yams
Getting gooey like chaos and jams
Playing banjos, pianos, and drums
I’mma get on my roaches and all my sons
You crumb.  Bang the truck with the click-clack
Clicky, clickable clack, back smack
Cats is wack, writing they rap, [?] on they track
Then they act as Casper
Crash the new truck in the rainstorm
Change form, change mine, change time, change crime
Change line, change soul.  Getting hot and old
Rhyme doubling, bubbling when I write shit
Hopping hip, hip to hop
Bruise your clique, bathe to techno, bathe to funk
Metro spectro gripping the mic
Rhyme-sniping the sound
I’m C-Rayz Walz—big shot on the east coast
I’m C-Rayz Walz—big shot on the east coast
I’m C-Rayz Walz—big shot on the east coast
I’m C-Rayz Walz—big shot on the east coast

[Verse 4: C-Rayz Walz]
Last week, I was on a four train, so these two kids [?]
Sound check and beats in my Walkman
Almost walked past and I stopped in my tracks
They looked like they could rap—they was twins, in fact
I’m reality, so I recognize real
Then I pulled out my pen to give my math to these cats
My BK fam is [?] and Sunz of Manly
Yes, I’m the God, y’all, and I’m seen and heard mostly
Taking Devil’s head for a trophy
Now I could yell, “Stronghold and O.B.S.”
My name’s C-Rayz—I was born to blaze
I came to drop [Cs?] that was too heavy to hold
[Or in school?], I learned [different?] from the spirit of soul
In my view, just remind your crew
I’m in the house like Jerome
I knew Prodigy since the age of fourteen
I could call H-A-V-O-C and get a beat
Connect with the Mobb or get your whole clique shot
Moe Greene got the [?]
I’m from the Bronx, y’all—it’s a wild west war

[Verse 5: C-Rayz Walz]
When I [grim?] grip the mic, everyone see the God
Get busy on the path ‘cause the math be potent
Scoping, seeing everything so clear
I return peace with “Degrees” right here
In my hood, it gets foul—the knives go “Blao!”
From the BX down to the Mecca
I stay tight and hold my head light—the protector
Yo, a sick village—zombies walk around
With they head in a knot [?] as the masters
Putting gas in tanks or buying from pastors
Coming from the subway, spitting on steps
Working all day with no time to rest
Players don’t like me.  Players won’t fight me
‘Cause I’ll violate your whole damn crew like Chris Lighty

[Bridge 2: C-Rayz Walz]
‘Bout to take a Stronghold.  [?].  [?].  Hot shit.  Check it out

[Verse 6: C-Rayz Walz]
Come into the screen, but they say, “No cinema”
All you cats is full of shit—you’ll need a enema
Tryna keep low on the low like senators
85 was [?], but they ain’t no friend of us
Ayyo, Stronghold clique is slick, will injure ya
Make the spot hot like Glocks in winter fuzz
My queen spit math—devils wanna censor her
The good look good, but I ain’t even enter her
Oh shit!  C-Rayz Walz writing [?]
You ain’t gotta ask—you’ll be right in my wrath
Fighting the wack, combat [coupons for free snacks?]
React like hammers just tapped the kneecap
On some new shit like [Nas in projects?]
So much material—I don’t know what to drop next
Nasty like [hot bets?] and [then the?] sex
[?] like royalty checks

[Bridge 3: C-Rayz Walz]
[?].  All People’s Army crew.  Uhuru
Me say, “Stronghold, you ruling hip hop”
Me dead prez say, “You ruling hip hop”
[?] saying, “Ya running hip hop”
With yin and yang, I now—we run it nonstop

[Verse 7: C-Rayz Walz]
From the [dub?] to the [master mix?], question marks to asterisk
Español to Arabic—all the cultures ask for it
Mathematics splashing kids—introducing nourishment
Me and Plain Pat stack facts for you savages
Capture this: propagating truth of your inhabitance
Sharper than the dagger, spit [?] at your arrogance
Reflect it when I send out [?] my route through synthesis
Earth is where I represent from [?] to the [?]
Say so never hesitant.  Where’s Stronghold?  (Yo!)
Know what?  ‘Bout to put it down until you throw up
Light the fuse and blow up.  Wack MCs, don’t show up
‘Cause even if you’d kick your illest rhymes, I’d still say, “So what?”

[Bridge 4: Frogg (from Eminem's "Just Don’t Give a Fuck")]
Woah, uh, get your hands in the air and get to clappin' 'em.  And like, back and forth, because, uh, this is what you thought it wasn't.  It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen.  I be the F-R-O-the-double-G.  And check out my man—he goes by the name of um, er

[Verse 8: C-Rayz Walz]
I’m in Haiti.  Buffed out like Lee Haney
I been crazy—psychologists gotta pay me
Labeled “loco,” smoking Chanel Coco
Fuck a written rhyme—I’ll freestyle acapoco
You must’ve drunk [?] and ate flames
In attempt to blaze yourself ‘cause in my range, you’ll get slain
Beats bang—the mute button say, “Word up”
I’ll kill you and get you framed for your own murder
I do what I want—don’t give a fuck about no props, bitch
Taking a piss after I stick my dick in your pocket
I have manners—it’s just that I’m shameless
Ayyo, fuck a shoutout—you know what my name is

[Hook 2: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
Hi!  My name is.  What?  My name is.  Who?  My name is “chka-chka”: C-Ray-Z
Hi!  My name is.  Huh?  My name is.  What?  My name is “chka-chka”: C-Ray-Z

[Bridge 5: C-Rayz Walz]
Excuse me!  Can I be allowed to make you laugh?  For one second?

[Verse 9: C-Rayz Walz]
I light spliffs without using a lighter (No, don’t)
So you wanna fight a tiger?  And battle Stronghold to Hydra? (No, no, no!)
I’m fucking wack, but don’t believe me—I’m a liar
‘Bout to rock the cypher like pebbles in a tire (What?)
My brain’s numb from staying outside like [slain?] tongue (Word)
I keep cutting your veins ‘til I find the main one (Ow!)
And Plain Pat said, “C-Rayz, you got talent”
I know—I’m getting revenge for my dead parent
I want the finer things in life like your house and your wife (Gimme)
Plus some straps.  Slice my sandwich with the OJ knife
I had a vampire bitch I gashed to cum in sunlight
The only cat ill enough to bring pencils to a gunfight
Getting leg, getting head while midgets in the Pentagon
Under the sprinkler system, juggling smoke bombs
Spit love out, punish my gats ‘til I let a slug route
Beware—you been illing with the best that bug out

[Verse 10: C-Rayz Walz]
Think I should rhyme about ice.  Can’t tell?
I want the hot shit minus the smell
The reason I rap is ‘cause the anger’s inside of me
I used to curse my moms out in her diary
I’m belligerent—well here’s where the difference is:
You passive and only act tough through penmanship
This kid’s militant—the [?] comes with killer shit
And I don’t start jobs I won’t finish, bitch
“Fuck the cops”—you heard what stic.man said
I threw a Molotov cocktail in the [precinct in flames?] (Word)
Shot in the head—yeah, some of my peeps got caught (Too much)
Too much heat in the street?  So a Glock got bought
And your gun shots ricochet when I spray
I heard one hit some wack MC on stage
Repping much more than the NYC
Shit, we in the Sun Cycle—the Rayz is C
Besides, you cats act so funny
And I don’t sweat no hottie (No hottie)
Your gun? (No gun).  I might torture some
And I’ll probably eat the pencil just to spite my tongue

[Bridge 6: C-Rayz Walz]
Sun Cycle MC
(All aboard!)
I’ll bark at y’all now, eat y’all niggas later
Y’all ain’t really players—where the fuck’s y’all gators?

[Verse 11: C-Rayz Walz]
If I see where my [?] with your eyes by the clip
With your eyebrows looking slick, so you know you getting bit
Got a crumb.  I wanna taste the whole plate
Got live in the state—this took time to create
What you see is what you never gonna get—my skill
So if I never get a deal, I’mma still be real
If I ever grab the microphone and I sound wack
Just believe I’m smoking dust, sniffing coke and crack
But I’mma hit you with your [birth?] so you don’t forget
If you ever play yourself, I’mma punch your shit
Then they gave me paper and they gave me cash
Plain Pat’s got my back when I needed to ask
Everybody knows that I’m nice to a beat
But when I’m hungry, who the fuck wanna help me eat?
