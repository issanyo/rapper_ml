[Intro: C-Rayz Walz]
Blowout.  Stronghold 5, Cardiño Reyes.  You still walking the surface.  Watch this.  True confessions

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
I can’t lie and I can’t complain
I’m the brother that make you head in the left lane of a airplane
And if I’m broke, I might snatch your bike chain
Then my head becomes a pool table and I rack my brain
I was there when Abel’s brother killed him—I’m co-Cain/cocaine
Uplifting Down syndrome, supporting Rogaine
I don’t give a fuck.  I don’t care, dukes
Plus I’m going bald—I’m not trying to hair/hear you
When I was broke, I was dope and borrowing
Went to my mom’s house, stole soy sauce and margarine
When the condom broke, I still stuck my dick in
Too much precum—I caught myself slipping
Get at me, dawg.  I’m taking flicks with Cool Joe
True confessions: I stole laptops from pseudo
Stole from the system when I got false beatings
Been fighting injustice since I was breastfeeding
When my mother abused me, I raped her pocketbook
Snatched all the paper, never stopped to look
If it was her last, she was the first to know
I just took it.  Later on, she would take it personal
When you say, “Freestyle,” I reply, “What about it?”
‘Cause I come off the top like hats that don’t match my outfit
When I flow, I glow, change the whole scenario
Emcees look stupid like Rakim in a Master P video
Peace to the seven, brethren.  I was born in Heaven
Married to the game—Uncle Ben threw rice at the wedding
Like a used condom, you really shouldn’t fuck with me
Advice from Daffy and Howard: Duck quickly
Before this, we was cool.  Right now, I hate you
So like Drago in Rocky IV, “I must break you”
Your face is stupid—why you looking at me smart?
A bad ending.  I must have got off to a good start
The only shit you’ll drop is in your pants, buddy
But you forgot your Pampers, your Luvs, and your Huggies
You’d rather walk through Brooklyn with a sign on your shirt
That says, “Bug me.  I don’t give a fuck.  Everyone’s butt”
