[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
I keep it moving like frog legs before the Cajun recipe
I hope I die on the mic so everyone can inherit me
I don’t spit on bars.  I drool on lava rocks
And keep my essays elevated like Guatemala potheads
In real life, there’s a time when the drama stops
And the teardrops goes plop like llama snot
Caught between Timberlands and travel fox
Past and present, from club nights to block fights
Adolescence to a grown man with worries and bills
I’m like a smart shopper looking for a deal
And all I find is bargains—a hungry artist never starving
Putting cyphers on squeeze like Charmin
I drink water when the money’s low, race my runny nose
And think stronger, longer to help these dummies grow
I don’t give a fuck like a celibate mind state
If you don’t see what I’m saying, consider this a blind date

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
Mood swings.  Emotional days in the park
Mood swings.  The light is but a shade of the dark
Mood swings.  Emotional days in the park
Mood swings.  The light is but a shade of the dark
Mood swings.  Emotional days in the park
Mood swings.  The light is but a shade of the dark
Mood swings.  Emotional days in the park
Mood swings.  Mood swings

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
If you ready to die for something, you better live it
I never dropped a album—The Prelude was a snippet
Beat a midget to death with my short end of the stick
Life is hectic and stressful—you must fight this
Mood swings.  Emotional days in the park
The light is but a shade of what stays in the dark
I used to blaze trees.  Now I cherish the bark
Plant the seeds deep, speak and inherit the art
I got roots in this, stealing spinach out the register
Travel light years—my peers is interstellar
Now get your groove back.  Life’s a beach with broken glass
Where your boots at?  Pitching fast?  I’ll get a hit and roof that
I see the swerve in your curve made of bourb to be slurred
We preserved eternally on the street curb—word
Forever I bless.  Sometimes, I get stressed and furious
Constipated like George—this shit got me Curious

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
Mood swings.  Emotional days in the park
Mood swings.  The light is but a shade of the dark
Mood swings.  Emotional days in the park
Mood swings.  The light is but a shade of the dark
Mood swings.  Emotional days in the park
Mood swings.  The light is but a shade of the dark
Mood swings.  Emotional days in the park
Mood swings.  Mood swings

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
Battery tested.  When sound checked, it was fully charged
Do not eat the remix.  Overstand the wooly gods
Spreading views.  Intuition is the weapon used
Seeing myself as the winner, I never lose
I throw claps back at you and receive what I give
Reading letters my pops wrote that he never did
Truly fact, my life booby-trapped like the groovy cats
I could die and be back before the credit reenact the intro
Youngest in charge, living large, pushing the Pinto
Evidence coincides—this ain’t coincidental
I got new headphones.  Lines busy, brain off the hook
A sight for sore eyes—when you go for self, it’s a strained look
My hindsight turned to ketchup and served burgers
Death whispered life in my ears—I heard, “Birth murder”
Like a sword and a shield, I hold the rhyme and the pen
Sometimes I lose it.  On the mic, I find it again
My throat goes hoarse, of course.  I might need some hay
Remember my name.  You’ll be screaming it someday
In the mist of lead showers beyond gun spray
Life as a traffic cop, nothing goes one way
On to Peter Pan listening to Pirate Radio
Full-moon clocks.  Lunatics going crazy, yo
Rhyming on a train, I became one with the track
Used to stay in my shell like slugs in a gat
I forced to react from a powerful impact
From the essence.  With blessings, I will be sent back

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
Mood swings.  Emotional days in the park
Mood swings.  The light is but a shade of the dark
Mood swings.  Emotional days in the park
Mood swings.  The light is but a shade of the dark
Mood swings.  Mood swings
