[Hook] [C-Rayz Walz]:
My real killers put family first
Work hard and the family eats
No beef cause the family pray
When I'm down call my family up
I still kick it where my family stay
A lot of strangers got my family's face
Nowadays cause my family's made
History, and a lot of mistakes
JFK 2 LAX
Never take a rest when I rep
The family crest

[Verse One] [Swave Sevah]:
I'd like to use this time to take off my hat to
One of hip hop's most influential rap groups
Premier and the Guru
Showed you The Meaning Of The Name
Flip The Script, with no Shame In they Game

[C-Rayz Walz]:
Retribution of the funk The Execution Of A Chump
Zonin'
As I Read My S-A
Don't front

[Swave Sevah]:
2 Deep, face the Moment Of Truth
Bangin' beats, speak Knowledge and heat
Every time he go in the booth

[C-Rayz Walz]:
Stay Tuned, gotchu
Blowin' Up The Spot
Suckas Need Bodyguards
Next time I throw the darts
Darker, denser
Prominent and pensive
The hip hop playbook we wrote, we livin' it
To amaze hundreds of fans
Rite Where U Stand
Bumpin' the jam, raise your hands
Cause I'm The motherfuckin' Man

[Swave Sevah]:
It's all in the Game Plan
Daily Operation
Makin' good music?
A daily occupation

[Hook] [C-Rayz Walz]:
My real killers put family first
Work hard and the family eats
No beef cause the family pray
When I'm down call my family up

History, and a lot of mistakes
JFK 2 LAX
Never take a rest when I rep
The family crest

[Verse Two] [Swave Sevah]:
Put In Work
Let the whole world Know My Steez
Speak Ya Clout
Never go against the Code Of The Streets
Keep your family close
Betrayal is irreversible
B.I. Vs. Friendship
Niggas will Take It Personal

[C-Rayz Walz]:
Hard To Earn so the G.od U.niversal
R.uler U.niversal, burn holes through
Mostly with the vocals
I meant The Voice
And what this meant
I'll take legendary over instant hit

[Swave Sevah]:
I make niggas Put Up Or Shut Up when they Step In The Arena
Kill will the Skills, send Militias to clean up

[C-Rayz Walz]:
Mixin' the beat up
Skillin' it with deep cuts
Plus makin' the chorus
Premier is a genius
Riot Akt rap to scratch
Plus the replay
Cause of y'all, I never wanted a broad, just a DJ

[Swave Sevah]:
To
Go for the gusto
Collect mo' figures
Started Just To Get A Rep
Now The Rep Grows Bigger

[Hook] [C-Rayz Walz]:
My real killers put family first

[Verse Three] [Swave Sevah]:
Yo, the illest brothers
Honorable mention
Former intellect, Beyond Comprehension

[C-Rayz Walz]:
Defied convention
Career longevity
Hardcore composer
Conscious Be Free
Featured G.Dep before Diddy
Fresh
Helped me move from The Ex Girl To The Next Girl with no pity
Yes, the whole city
Out for Mass Appeal
So gritty
Made us wanna rhyme with no deal
The Sun Rised In The East cause son shined on the beats
Three tracks for Jay-Z
You think he primed on his peak?
Keep it real
Other producers compete in they sleep
To beat the producer of their dreams
That you can still see on the street
When the Ac come back I'll relax
Or relapse on some, "stick up kids is out to tax"
The Positivity is so addicting
Even now
Do you motherfuckers know what DWYCK means?
