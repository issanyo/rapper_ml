[Chorus] [C-Rayz Walz]:
I'm talkin' 'bout the city
She got rotten milk in her titty
But her nipples look good and if I really could
I would bag me the State of Liberty

[Verse One] [C-Rayz Walz]:
Fright night like Dwight Gooden I'm dope
Shop a Strawberry, raw ready, pinstripe folks
With Bernhard Goetz kids, you lovin' that left hit
We're not underground, we the crack in the crevice
Subway performers, donations accepted
Probation detected
Slow patient infected
80's crazy, Larry Davis baby
Live from the meadow lands, harpoons Haiti
Slugs blastin'
Mad drug trafficin'
Spanish mami's with the booties of Africans
True pinstriper, trap hanger for lifer
Clap bangers we hyper
Rap halos and ciphers
The iron horse galaxy, we stay ridin'
No gold, the streets is paved in trident
Bubble goose your orbit, can't go pop here
Rest in peace Coney Island, life is not fair
A small world of hip hop the scene is huge
We got power from the streetlight, then blew the fuse
Where the worm is
You never forget once you've been
New York in the house, how much is the rent?

[Verse Two] [Karniege]:
Karniege is chillin'
Mos def I'm New York like Frank Sinatra
Soul in the hole, control hip hopera
It started here, then became popular
All over the world, New York is poppin' up
Home of the rotten apple, cops will cap you
Not like a fitted; pistol or body bag you
Fast slang talkers? That's New York shit
Robbed in the mornin'? That's a New York vic
Song bang awesome? That's a New York hit
Mommy body gorgeous? That's New York chicks
Ride the iron horse, visit our boroughs
We still dispute about who the most thorough
Tourists take pics, amaze how we livin'
9/11 scenery, we won't forget it
Skyline, parkways, tunnels, bridges
Keeps us grindin', New York get busy

[Verse Three] [Vast Aire]:
I'm lookin' at cats like, "Who do you think you are?"
I'm a New York star
Mighty Jo, watch the flow
You be a nation of gods, it's possible
B.K.N.Y., to uptown niggas
To the downtown thugs with the ill figures
Shawty in the park with the ill figure
(Yo Vast that's my niece)
Go figure
I'm about to smash
Then I gotta hustle and stand on the corner and count my cash
It's a New York thing
A New York swing
I was born in Mt. Vernon, a New York king
I started, rhymin' in Queens
I spit a light beam to wreck the scene
We them New York kids that don't grin
Cause every year we want the Knicks to win

[Verse Four] [Access Immortal]:
I love the Yanks, I ain't never been a New York Mets fan
Livin' in Gotham City but the world ain't Batman
Seem like everybody reppin' here got rap plans
? master fitted or headband
? when I was hustlin' my life story
I grew up on the block, seekin' the mic glory
Sittin' in class, folks barely did a thing for me
Couldn't stop the fact I'm always leakin' from my brain stormin'
New York days are more than New York nights
Tourists always fascinated off of Time Square lights
I know hustlers in Brooklyn that'll cook up white
Drink the bottles, gettin' blunted in the project flights
On the real, most ghettos that I know is a coffin
And murders, many happen in my city too often
This ain't a place an enemy would want to get lost man
The Hudson is a river that you'll likely get tossed in

[Chorus] [C-Rayz Walz]:
We're talkin' 'bout the city
She got rotten milk in her titty
But her nipples look good and if I really could
I would bag me the State of Liberty
We're talkin' 'bout the city
She got rotten milk in her titty
But her nipples look good and if I really could
I would bag me the State of Liberty

[Verse Five] [Poison Pen]:
New York denizen
New York tenement
New York citizen
New York militant
New York sentences
New York fitted man
New York nemesis
New York sentences
Albee Square Mall is gone
Moment of silence
Kenmore Theater of violence
Get popped on while you get your popcorn
On the ave, my favorite number spot gone
? Hospital, metropolitan and church
The new New York don't work
I'mma form my team, you call us a gang
Run us through the system again and again
Caught the BX, criminal court bitch
Trade Gameboys at Coliseum
See if these fronts fit
Game room ?
Pass my pool stick
Call my chick Apollo, she walk with a two fifth

[Chorus] [C-Rayz Walz]:
Don't talk 'bout the city
She got rotten milk in her titty
But her nipples look good and if I really could
I would bag me the State of Liberty
Don't talk 'bout the city
She got rotten milk in her titty
But her nipples look good and if I really could
I would bag me the State of Liberty
