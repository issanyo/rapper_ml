The proof was in the pudding neighborhood called her Jello
My man thought she was thorough - poor fellow!
She fucked more niggas than legal aid in each borough
Favorite color yellow; cheesy racked tendency profound mellow
The role of a serene sister, I miss her
Undercover gossip put her world in a twister
The setting is a sinister slum where sex ain't sacred
By thirteen she was pro-active and naked
Had a gift to give but she would tend a path not taken
Twenty years old she wishes she was in The Matrix
Years passed mad relationships ain't last
Her esteem was the small amount of sand in her hourglass
I told her she was beautiful she felt the opposite
Had the pieces to the puzzle couldn't find a proper fit
Each time we spoke she said, 'Something gotta give
I'm glad I ain't got a kid cause I don't even want to live!'

Mommy, my sister, her, she
Grandma, auntie, my daughter, my niece
My cousin, my wife, another part of me
Is where it all started see
But now we got chicken, slut, whores, tricks
Skins, ass, pussy, bitch
Hooker, hoodrat, that shit sounds sick!
Yigga-yigga-yo watch your lip!

"Get out my mind!" she tells herself time after time
Ignorin words spoke by the most high divine
In her own eyes she was less than prime
So sublime her smile upside down would decorate her lip line
Words note this cry for help by a wise man
Real short attention span, you know man
Parties in her head leave her eyes jam
Tears ran down cheek lane hell she would keep flings
Gave it up for fake things, street gangs, and cheap chains
Slept on the beasts who fiend for sweet dames
Take her stride with guys but yo they was lame
Hijacked a seat on my mental plane
She wanted dedication but kept finding debt bills
No skill, and life ills helped her to strip
She would diet, crying, but didn't notice
Pretty flowers get devoured, now know this
It's like Lauren (flippin in the ghetto on a dirty mattress)
Dreams of being nurse, a school teacher, or an actress
Surrounded by self hate happiness pursued by the sadness
She committed suicide on the Sabbath
Young queen lost she was no longer a girl
Killed by lack of understanding in an ignorant world
She played the roll, but yo her supporting cast
Was every man that lied to her just to get in the ass

[In a whisper]
Mommy, my sister, her, she
Grandma, auntie, my daughter, my niece
My cousin, my wife, another part of me
Is where it all started see
But now we got chicken, slut, whores tricks
Skins, ass, pussy, bitch
Hooker, hoodrat, that shit sounds sick!
Yigga-yigga-yo watch your lip!
