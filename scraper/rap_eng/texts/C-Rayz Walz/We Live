[Intro: C-Rayz Walz]
Ste-Lo.  C-Rayz

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
(We live) where your close friends die
And they say that a man ain't supposed to cry
(We live) amongst the stress and struggle
And we know that the beast don't love you!
(We live) next door to rats and gats
And the cats is in the back selling crack
(We live) where there's no God in the sky
But we live ‘cause we can't die!

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
We live where Heavy Metal ain't a rock magazine (Nah, for real)
But you'll get shot down with Glock magazines (I feel)
When we do good, we did wrong
Dougie got murdered in the hood but he still lives on
We play ball in the snow with our bubblegoose warm
Trying to clap boards with our church shoes on
We live where the ambulance take too long
When your ass is on the line like you dressed in thongs
(Be strong!)—the same thing I told my mother
With blood on her shoulder as she was holding my brother
(We live) where du-rags stay under the hat
And you don't want waves, but the bandana gotta match
Cause some still rock gold where everybody went plat'
Looking at the ground like "Yo!  What's up with that?!?"
We live where some people fight fair
Everybody got a pair of Nike Airs and police is right there

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
(We live) where your close friends die
And they say that a man ain't supposed to cry
(We live) amongst the stress and struggle
And we know that the beast don't love you!
(We live) next door to rats and gats
And the cats is in the back selling crack
(We live) where there's no God in the sky
But we live ‘cause we can't die!

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
We live,where I could be the next man out
And shit is really Ludacris now like Def Jam South
Just let, let me know what's your fantasy
Mine is to live 'til 50 with a family
Can it all be so simple then?  The instrumental ends
On stage, I kill it with a stenciled pen
It's not strange how the whole thing went down
It's a shame everybody want a bling chain now
(We live) where the young ones is bigger than me
It used to be P-A-L and Little League
That's dead now.  Nobody wanna play on the block
Everybody want rims and a big-faced knot
It's not a game.  I don't coach—I watch
From the sidelines.  Players be missing they shots!
And I still clap ‘cause I know how it is
"Time out!"  We be trying to score where we live

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
(We live) where your close friends die
And they say that a man ain't supposed to cry
(We live) amongst the stress and struggle
And we know that the beast don't love you!
(We live) next door to rats and gats
And the cats is in the back selling crack
(We live) where there's no God in the sky
But we live ‘cause we can't die!

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
We live where a 40 and a blunt is breakfast
And police swerve to serve and disrespect us
Churches gassed up, Chinese foods induce asthma
Roaches run fast.  The rats run faster
This feeling got a few cracks.  The corner's flooded
Tell me who want it.  We wake up from bad dreams blunted
Basketball games feel like heaven
I married the streets—Uncle Ben threw rice at the wedding
Classic like a slap box festival
Or when cats come home from doing five live federal
Surrounded by cheese like Domino.  Copy cool
Mommy got a gat—papi too
Next to the liquor store, next to the church
Cause of the verse, I'm in the Vibe, next on the verse
Cause of the dirt in my past, I'm still grimy
Still living, moving forward with death behind me

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
(We live) where your close friends die
And they say that a man ain't supposed to cry
(We live) amongst the stress and struggle
And we know that the beast don't love you!
(We live) next door to rats and gats
And the cats is in the back selling crack
(We live) where there's no God in the sky
But we live ‘cause we can't die!
