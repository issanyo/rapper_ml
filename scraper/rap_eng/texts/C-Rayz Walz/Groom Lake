[Intro:]
Other alien visitors meeting secretly
With military or government officials
But what about today
I think I last seen him in Area 51
With JS, JS-1
(deep laughter)
Yeah
I last seen him in Area 51
J,J,J,J,J, JS-1

[Verse 1:]
Moon patrol section 5
One lunatic
You know what time it is
The population likes you to freak
Lost in a sea of information
They got us square
X-files exhibit
The Outer Limits we living in
Flow like solid gold
[?] garlic clothes
The said the bridge was open
How could they [?] more patrols
Bloodsuckers who roam in this modern machine
Phase of
Physical drones
And flesh digital chromes
Don’t even watch the [?]
The sneakers is chosen
Chemotherapy
Streets be packed with hemoglobins
And they rock the omen
The foot is still closing
And hip hop stolen
Locked in the Vatican
Take Rolexes
While they was time traveling
My divine pattern is that of an Elven priest
So the big thing
Really is a small thing to me
So silly (echo)

[Chorus:]
Out of place
Space and time
These clones and clowns
They really down for their background
All the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
Last seen in Area 51
Out of place
Space and time
I can see not even a satellite
All the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
Last seen in Area 51

[Verse 2:]
Boombox
Stereo rocks
Prize out the cereal box
This serial is a real live
Mysterial plot
It’s the return of the spit
The spliffs, gripping the fifth
Level in the pentagon
Miss the paradigm shift
Brussel sprout abortion
Muscle spot i’m forcing
Copping your taste buds
Face give your face suds
The cash yard tentacles
The black barn angles
The white robe dismantled
Nice big virgin
Whirly black birds
Full of turds
While I’m on to fuller clips
Like word
Sound power
Devour
Nightline symmetry
Hymns never get seen
Who wears the pants seemingly
Who cares
It bears [?]
Those show love
Like Cupid butt
Chivalry
New glitter
For my old glove
Glimmery
Long as the days of chivalry
Sometimes I want to walk the hall
With finger long legs
Swords and silver rings
Bling
Drop a bomb on my alarm clock
Rap like a saint in the boondocks
While you suckers go plat
I’ll get paid with moon rocks
The only true drop to umbrella
When the tune stops abruptly
JS-1
