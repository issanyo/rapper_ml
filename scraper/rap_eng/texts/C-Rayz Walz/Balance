[Intro: Sample from [?]]
[?]
You force me to use God’s skills against you

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
Brothers will ice pick you for a food stamp booklet
I walk a straight path, smile crooked
Fiends in the Alley like Bookman
The good times seem so gone when you stand over caskets looking
Out of boredom, I taught myself to make bombs
I learned that hot lead keeps the snakes calm
In the killing fields, I’m strapped with the 23rd Psalm
Alert when the trees blazed like the Viet Cong
Dirty street signs make me want to release 9s
And flash middle fingers instead of peace signs (Please, please)
Keep a swan at a distance—the beef closing
“Dressed in all black like The Omen” - Lil' Kim on Puff Daddy's "It's All About the Benjamins (Remix).”  Head swollen
The results: dice rolling, running wild, mouth foaming
Controlling this land slowly, clips on and still showing
The fear, son?  Might get the point from a spear gun
My Jackets is Full Metal—you wanna wear one?
Mind state in a place (Come on) where the great dare come (Come on)
My mind state in a place (Come on) where the great dare come (Come on)

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
I tote L’s, polly on life and death
I can’t be alright/all right (Why?)—there would be no left
Deal equal—bring new life and kill people
You gotta be good when it’s evil
Make liars believe you ‘til blind people see through
Deaf heads heed you, gun tongue speak truth
I tote L’s, polly on life and death
I can’t be alright/all right (Why?)—there would be no left
Deal equal—bring new life and kill people
You gotta be good when it’s evil

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
The cypher’s ill—go hold your seat on a Ferris wheel (Watch out)
Balance the scale.  The other day, I did something ill for real
Ate pork then drank spring water distilled
Things switched up—bubblegum feet stand still
I’m the last piece of love in your heart
The anger dark from the start
Big-puzzle rap—I’m just playing my part
I write light to escape the dark, but it’s still here
I don’t give a fuck, but I still care
Greedy ones share riches, stairs become stitches
Depicting vision—I’m getting better at the sick shit
Some say I got the illest, most nasty flow
But I’m the sun—you don’t have to gas me, yo
I ship kis/keys, mail Swizz Beatz a Casio
Get serious, in fact, like Jim Carrey jokes
Do the knowledge, inspect my truth—I’m sincere
The shadow of the circle is a square
So I don’t care if your brain is pierced with purple hair
I’m from the essence.  Be easy or you’ll get sent there

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
I tote L’s, polly on life and death
I can’t be alright/all right (Why?)—there would be no left
Deal equal—bring new life and kill people
You gotta be good when it’s evil
Make liars believe you ‘til blind people see through
Deaf heads heed you, gun tongue speak truth
I tote L’s, polly on life and death
I can’t be alright/all right (Why?)—there would be no left
Deal equal—bring new life and kill people
You gotta be good when it’s evil

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
King in the ring on some diamond shit.  Rhyming quick, I switch directions
Some lust, self-combust—just read expression
Major league, make it hard to breath, bloody your fatigues
Study your sneeze and think how I’ll bless you—“Degrees”
In the morning, I choke L’s, then brush my teeth
Fuck fighting—most heads get snuffed with heat
The killing fields.  Unconceal plots for real
Blocks is hot like the average cop shot plot
In junior high, my people brought guns to school
Fuck the rules—the mentality was “Buck the blues!”
And don’t get suspending blowing smoke, burning incense
Some got married to a life sentence—no repentance
The murder incidents is endless, death is business
The best defense is the fences.  No coincidences
Bastards classic like Vlasic Pickles
Bad habits get you blasted with massive missiles
If cash is the issue, in the grave, stash it with you (Take you)
Under that stone with your first, middle, and last initial

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
I tote L’s, polly on life and death
I can’t be alright/all right (Why?)—there would be no left
Deal equal—bring new life and kill people
You gotta be good when it’s evil
Make liars believe you ‘til blind people see through
Deaf heads heed you, gun tongue speak truth
I tote L’s, polly on life and death
I can’t be alright/all right (Why?)—there would be no left
Deal equal—bring new life and kill people
You gotta be good when it’s evil
