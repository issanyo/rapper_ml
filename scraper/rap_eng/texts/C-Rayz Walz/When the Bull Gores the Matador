Let 'em clap...that'll do it
Turn up the bass...whatever...clap, clap, clap
C-Rayz. That's the ticket! That's it!
MJEX, Messiah J, The Expert (four eyes)
Put on a performance

This is for the little fish sick of taking big fish crap (no more)
This is for the lunch money victims leaving bullys on their back
This is for employees putting miserable employers on the rack (no more)
For the tortoise who passes the hare on last lap
When the bull gores the matador everyone's hands clap

Gather around round listen up now hop to
This is a tale from your average stockroom
Where sweat drips to a hideous pop tune
And the long shot slog under a big boss boom
It happened one hot June down at the local supermarket
Where immigrants and schoolkids were horrored to the hardship
People need Danny, Danny's their main character
An honest Chinaman on a minimum wage salary
He behaved mannerly, smiled at all the shop folk (Hi!)
Whistled while he worked and he worked with his mouth open
Dreamt of a top post, obeyed every rule
But the manager dismissed him as another Asian fool
It's the same old true story, its sad but true
Big boss man picking on the non-national
Wanted his contract pulled but couldn't find a misdemeanor
So he stitched him up on a charge of sticky fingers
Fired over missing money Danny said listen buddy
I know the system and that's unfair dismissal dummy
He cooled his fists of fury kept his head hold high
And made a landmark for every last small fry
All rise, All rise in the Labour Court room
Where justice prevailed and Danny made a fortune
Go tell a friend tell the boo-boy of the hour
Down this corridor of power you can play this war too

This is for the little fish sick of taking big fish crap
Let your hands clap let your hands clap
This is for the lunch money victims leaving bullys on their back
Let your hands clap let your hands clap
This is for employees putting miserable employers on the rack
Let your hands clap let your hands clap
For the tortoise who passes the hare on last lap
When the bull gores the matador everyone's hands clap

[C-Rayz Walz]
I'm on a stage more like a cage or a box
A plagiarous plot to drop old shit and go pop
Stop! That's not the herd I'm from
A public death spectacle, murder for fun?
The crowd cheers I feel hatred and their evil stares
In the Colosseum colossal screams fog the air
Watch for Veronica I smell she's there
My point's a peek-at-door and so I gotta prepare
Tragedy's confused today the winners lose
The running of the bull I move without shoes
Love lies in lust my blood in the dust
That don't stop the beef the meek shall rise up
Now it's red curtains with no time to stand back
Turn your fingers to triggers and let your hands clap
And that's what I call a round of applause
It's gorgeous when the bull gorges the matador

[Hook]
This is for the little fish sick of taking big fish crap
Let your hands clap let your hands clap
This is for the lunch money victims leaving bullys on their back
Let your hands clap let your hands clap
This is for employees putting miserable employers on the rack
Let your hands clap let your hands clap
For the tortoise who passes the hare on last lap
When the bull gores the matador everyone's hands clap

Clap hands,(yeah yeah) oh yeah clap hands (clap on)
(clap clap clap clap clap clap clap)

Now there's an unspoken word it's an unwritten rule
The condition for young ones is gettin' plundered in school
Once in a month of Sundays under a blue moon
Young kittens grow whiskers and underdogs drool
Hooper Humperdinck proves to be the life of every party
Mister small fry takes a whole frickin' army
Remember Goliath the guy who tapped out or what not
Puffin' out his chest as Dave practised his pot shots
Misfits and odd pots come on struggle with me
That big little Sasquatch need to come with me
Up flippin' the food chains a cool flame
For anyone with blue vains under jock-straps tough titties
Listen fall guys giant slayers rally round
Barbequeueing the form up is the best justice in town
I put my heating bill down Santa's little number
Fucking leave the bill cause it's about to go down

Let your hands clap let your hands clap
For the tortoise who passes the hare on last lap
When the bull gores the matador everyone's hands clap
