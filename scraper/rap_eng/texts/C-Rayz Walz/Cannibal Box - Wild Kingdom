[Hook 1: C-Rayz Walz]
Hey, kids.  Wanna hear something bugged?
When the knife’s in your back, the slugs under the rug
In this wild kingdom, watch the animals rock
A mechanical plot in a cannibal box

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
My troops think fast like mongoose math in class
With king cobras, other large snakes in the grass
With the speed of a lightning flash
Army ants move past to splash your grasshopper stash
Get mad, think long range like giraffe brain playing in grain
Terrain lion mane wisdom drips his pain (Pain)
Fireflies spit, some suicide-sick monkeys flip
But hold strong like gorilla grips of clips
Shells in the cylinder, kid.  The beast will release sooner or later
In this room of perpetrators like [Sooner to?] Gators
Predators should watch out for player haters
Who have imaginary lines like equators
Electric eel peels with slicker moves
And bounce quick like kangaroos after they kick it with you
Thirteen arrows snatched from the eagle’s grasp
Used by the Sagittarius to strike the fatal blast

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
A swollen force from a Trojan Horse
A past Odyssey, modestly, was a stolen course
None of your men are raw like lab rats chased by the Minotaur
(You’ll die!) in a minute or more
Your flight’s fable—like Pegasus, you don’t soar
Frogs bounce off logs, move door to door
Lizards with Glocks slide off to plot
You could see the phoenix rise when the block is hot
Watch your step—you in danger shoes
In the belly of the beast, it’s sad but the anger soothes
Crackheads are vultures who kill what’s dead
Most thieves stuck up—they stuck down instead
Blood runs red like baboons striped to face you
Falcons fled, search for eggs from aerial angles
“I hate you” is law when the meat’s raw
But this is what you waited all year for like bear snores

[Hook 2: Samples with Scratches]
“Animals.  Animals.  Ani-animals” - [?]
“Animals.  Animals with speakers on” - [?]
“Animal rap.  Animal rap” - [?]
“The animals are cannibals to do you in” - [?]

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
The cats and dogs should form a large group
‘Cause they both got beef with Old MacDonald
Mr. Eagle stay bald.  Razor-sharp claws in his contract
His chick irie, made you itch off contact
A bug’s life: dragonflies is thug type
Mosquitos sniff through long needles—illegal drug pipes
Killer bees spark lighters, flyers get liver
Aspire to be wiser and, in Nas, see the spider
Goats gruff, wolfpacks rock sheep skin, stay creeping
The Earth was square—tortoise raced hares off the deep end
The old owl peeped the cypher all weekend
In our crew but he knows “Whooo” and creeping
King of the jungle when I come through, screaming, “One, two”
Like Noah, other animals flow up the mumble
The jackal’s laugh made the pigs show up
The math made Jack’s beanstalk grow up

[Verse 4: C-Rayz Walz]
Like gnats, your riffraff is irrelevant
My big splash is the bath with six elephants
I trained with Amanda in search of the golden panda
Elements stood tall like bamboo trees
On lakes, I meditate and breathe through a reed
Intakes oxygen through a mountainous vapor sneeze
Tag my name in Japanese on Chinese newspaper
Tale of a humpback whale who does flavors
We take out music with samurai swords
Dragons transform to Honda Accords
Five-finger energy clench like this
C-Rayz Walz, my animalistic kit
Dialogue dispense through divine evidence
But... ROAR!  What type of style is this?
Lion fist, poisonous scorpion piss
Dropped the elephant shit right in front your donkey bitch
Now trip on this like snail dick and flip sick
Big scripts thick like llama spit
Hyenas laugh at your ass and blast silver
And if you ever come back, we’ll kill ya!
