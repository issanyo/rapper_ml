[Sample]:
I'm gonna do it for ya

[Chorus] [C-Rayz Walz]:
Hip hop foundation
Known for gettin' that
I'm from uptown, the Boogie
Where rap was invented at
"I'm gonna do it for ya"
"I do my thing, I'm from the Boogie Down Bronx" - Fat Joe
Hip hop foundation

"I'm gonna do it for ya"
"I'm not from New York I'm from The Bronx"

[Verse One] [C-Rayz Walz]:
I do my thing
I put a fat lace through my string
Aerosol lord, cardboard king
Bling in the bing
Register my team my "Ching!"
In your mental bank I make the pencil shank
And carve my name in the walls of fame
Fuck a trap
I Rock Steady like freeze
Emergency breaks on trains can not stop me
Cold Crush a party to a boombox beat
Two fathers
One sun/son cycle to blaze
Pin strike send the bike on the mic I Hell Raise
I am P.A.L. with Coronas in Crotona Park
Tremont
Big Pun hang on my block
A ghost with me
Walz, Mr. Magic off top
Live from Webster Ave
Larry Davis toss shots
I'm from the borough
You should keep talkin' about
We love attention
Keep my major deek in your mouth

[Verse Two] [A.G.]:
Born in the Bronx
Home of the Cold Crush
And the Hercaloids, heavens to Mercatroids
My Planet Rock from abandoned blocks
Where you gotta keep your eyes on the cops
Our world begins when the camera stops
My older brother used to spray the cans a lot
I used to rap
Locked in
While Mr. Magic, KRS-1 and Scott La Rock
I rapped off Dotted Rock, that's how I got it hot
Put the X on my chest like a logo
So when you see me in the street and you wanna act like you don't know
{gun clicks}
No no
Now-a-days they be runnin' to the po-po
Rap dudes is so-so
And I rep for the X so let Kurtis Blow know
We should wet 'em up like so
