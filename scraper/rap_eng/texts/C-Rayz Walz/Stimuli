JOHN ROBINSON:
He keeps it Ital because its vital/
Can fall victim to the wicked system cycle
Meditate blow steam
Medicate blow green
No pollution of the mind god, Go Green!
Build a team of A-Alikes around the Global
And go back to the Scienz and all the lesson we told you!
I'm hopeful, I spoke to so many in this time
Of course we paint pictures wit these Rhymes
So vivid wit designs
So Optimistic in his Prime
Realistic, kickin ballistics forever Shine!
Immortal what we saw true, the catalogs the offering
Watch when we fall Thru!/
We bringing all new!/
And then we'll take it back to move forward/
I'm ready to live my life like the Chorus!/
I been Living but the Science is Elevation
It's JR, Walz & Life
The Awakening
STIMULI!
