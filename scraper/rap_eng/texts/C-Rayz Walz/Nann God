[Intro]
[MINdDitect]
Word is bond.  I’m tryna talk to the God, C-Rayz.  He over there, smelling like frankincense and myrrh.  I’m saying, “Shorty is shining.”
[C-Rayz Walz]
Yeah?  So you saying I always nice, right?  Yo.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
You don't know Nann God that live the truth like me
Show and prove like me, cook vegetables, eat fruit like me
And you don't know Nann God that elevate they flow
While others strive for dough, I live my culture and say so
Yo, you don't know Nann God that don’t act like a slave
Plus, my degrees ain’t trained—I bring sunshine with the rain
And you don't know Nann God that’ll understand your jewels
Without pride or ridicule.  Take trips in the mind and visit you
You don't know Nann God with energy like C
Rayz Walz make a slave get free and live your true identity
‘Cause you don't know Nann God.  Earth, earth
Yo, you don't know Nann God.  Yo, yo, yo
Yo, you don't know Nann God that preserve theyself like me
And you don't know Nann God that got more [?] than I do, queen
And you don't know Nann God.  I don’t care what name they wear
Use black soap to wash my hair, choose rap coats to rock all year
And I don't know Nann Queen that bless the king like you
Question everything like you.  Shorty, guess what?  I like you
And I rock the mic like you.  For life, I got to fight like you
Use true light to see right through all them things them devils do
‘Cause they don't know Nann God.  Earth, earth
Yo, they don't know Nann God

[Bridge]
[MINdDitect]
You saying I’m water, son.  You know’m saying?
[C-Rayz Walz]
What, what?  Yo, you don't know Nann God
[MINdDitect]
Don’t mistake me for someone that don’t got knowledge of self.  You know’m saying?
[C-Rayz Walz]
Yeah.  Aight, I hear that
[MINdDitect]
Nah, do you hear me for real?
[C-Rayz Walz]
Do the knowledge.  That’s peace

[Verse 2: MINdDitect]
‘Cause you don't know Nann Queen who’s head wrap ain’t a trend
Crush the walls of ignorance, got more going on than just the rent
Nah, you don't know Nann Queen who can cook the tofu like me
Clean your system out with green tea.  Don’t memorize, live 120
Now you don't know Nann Queen who cherish truth like me
And you don't know Nann Queen who can only deal in equality
Nah, you don't know Nann Queen who can make the universe split
Rip the mic and straight rip that shit, flood you out with every time I spit
Nah, you don't know Nann Queen who loves the Gods like I do
Feeds off high energy foods, meditate to keep us in tune
Nah, you don't know Nann Queen who love to build all the time
One whose thoughts is clearer than mine—shine so bright, I give sight to the blind
Nah, you don't know Nann Queen, God.  See?
‘Cause you don't know Nann Queen, God.  See what’m saying?

[Bridge 2]
[C-Rayz Walz]
Nope.  Oh.  So if you the queen, we got to be a queen and king together, understand?  We no Nann, make this universe expand.  Hold hands for the whole universe
[MINdDitect]
You know’m saying?  I’m saying I’m shining, you shining.  Why don’t we just shine together?
[C-Rayz Walz]
[I don’t get the?] queen here
[MINdDitect]
I’m saying.  You see the [?]

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
You don't know Nann that admit when they don’t know
Clean the house, cook, wash the clothes, make the bed and mop the floor
You don't know Nann who [?] reflections of Allah
Drinking water at the bar, returning home like Jafar
You don't know Nann that be looking good like me
My spirit is beauty.  And that’s truly what you see
Who say, “Peace,” and mean it like me
Rayz receive equally
Wear fatigues, drink green tea
Ditect MINd.  Earth, you don't know Nann
Yo, you don't know Nann
