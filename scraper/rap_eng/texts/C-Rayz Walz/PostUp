[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
Yo, we post up and build in front of the kids
Pay them bills for real ‘cause we gotta live
The rest of the chorus will come when I write it
So for now, just pretend you psychic (Psychic)
Yo, we post up and show skills in front of the kids
Pay them bills for real ‘cause we gotta live
My life is real—you can feel when I’m writing
So if you living, you better act like it

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
Yo, I can’t stand y’all—I should make y’all sit down
I’m an asshole?  Well let me drop this shit now
I’ll kill you—my mouth is a gun.  Click, blao, blao
On some Kool Moe Dee—“How You Like Me Now?”
I spaz out, pull math out and equate
Elevate—my conversation educates
Levitate my stats every time I rap
I’m hip hop, listening to R&B with slack
Smoking a Bob Marley with anthrax in my backpack
Well-rounded like perfect paws and circle cats
It’ll hurt you, black, like “Did I do that?”
The Urkel rap—my Family Matters, in fact
I cypher sounds with Funk and Flex on clowns
Get your hands out your pocket.  Calm down!
Everyone’s rushing.  I slow it up and be different
That’s how iMac like computers without pimping

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
Yo, we post up and build in front of the kids
Pay them bills for real ‘cause we gotta live
The rest of the chorus will come when I write it
So for now, just pretend you’re psychic
Yo, we post up, show skills in front of the kids
Pay them bills for real ‘cause we gotta live
My life is real—you can feel when I’m writing
So if you living, you better act like it (Act like it)

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
I’m the black market artist—you don’t wanna start this
I rock PlayStation 2 with a SEGA cartridge
The next level of the game (Yeah).  Life’s for real
A smart shopper—that’s how I got my deal (You wanna know?)
Some go plat’.  Others run for steeling/stealing
My tracks is hot—hotter than a devil when it’s chilling (Hot)
You better get a front pass, make the fun last
I got stupid money (What?).  I mean dumb cash
Roll with the force, of course, or get trampled
That girl you kissed lips may contain a sperm sample
It ain’t no party—where the tail you can pin the donkey on?
But you’ll get the point later like a junky’s arm
I told kids, “You can get Tricked or Charms”
Bomb con the arm or just set it off to get on
Incite me to see it before it happens
So if I incite the riot, will that lead to clapping?

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
Yo, we post up and build in front of the kids
Pay them bills for real ‘cause we gotta live
The rest of the chorus will come when I write it
So for now, just pretend you psychic
Yo, we post up, show skills in front of the kids
Pay them bills for real ‘cause we gotta live
My life is real—you can feel when I’m writing
So if you living, you better act like it

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
I’m all over the net like a clumsy insect
I’ve been a vet, been Stronghold, been a wreck
Been baking.  Then seen Ben Franklins
I been seen it, but I’m patient so I been waiting
And police Bengay/been gay without the ointment
Benefitting from crime—Bushwick to Boynton
I bench press my borough, rep my set
Bitch warrant got the most benevolent stress
And beloved, not to be on no bullshit
If you don’t smoke the whole L, you get a full clip (Blat, blat)
I spit funky—you can words, town herbs
I’m dope enough to get you bent like the bell curve
I pay fifty dollars for milk, bread, and cereal (Damn)
Holler if you with me now, say, “I feel you!  I feel you!”
Post up like cereal on top of the fridge
Some of this is over your head, kids

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]
Ayyo, we post up and build in front of the kids
Pay them bills for real ‘cause we gotta live
The rest of the chorus will come when I write it
So for now, just pretend you psychic
Yo, we post up and show skills in front of the kids
Pay them bills for real ‘cause we gotta live
My life is real—you can feel when I’m writing
So if you living, you better act like it

[Outro: C-Rayz Walz]
Yo, we post up.  Right in front of the kids.  We post up, reveal in front of the kids.  Living?  You better act like it.  Stronghold.  Whose style is the sickest?  SH5, Cardiño Reyes.  Splatting you.   Discovering time.  Jeepers.  Cream them cats.  Zoinks!  Hahaha
