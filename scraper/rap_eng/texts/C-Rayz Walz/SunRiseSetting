[Hook: Sample from Exuma's "Mama Loi, Papa Loi"]
The sun is shining in the night
Zombies walking in the broad daylight
The sun is shining in the night
Zombies walking in the broad daylight
The sun is shining in the night
Zombies walking in the broad daylight
Zombie, he done lost his soul
Zombie, he don't ever get old

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
I could survive anywhere, any state of mind
Any institution by any design
Not down with any crime, but at any given time
Anything less than Walz is uncivilized
Getting bread like pumpernickel.  Pumping nickels
In beef, put four to five and pump the nickel
Played the hate, glad I made it.  My datings triple
Y’all might walk the talk, but my language cripples
I’m feeling myself—don’t open the door ‘til I’m finished
To the grates in your face, my script bump and blemish
Broccoli clumps and spinach.  No beef!
Iced out like your freezer’s missing—no heat
Go ahead and stick me—I need a hit of that dope shit
I’m quiet.  When I riot, I’m ferocious
Watch for vultures, flying locusts, hocus pocus
$2000 a cut like a pair of loafers.  The Sun Cycle!

The sun is shining in the night
Zombies walking in the broad daylight
Zombie, he done lost his soul
Zombie, he don't ever get old
