[Intro: C-Rayz Walz, ([?]), and Voicemail Skit]
[C-Rayz Walz and ([?])]
Life’s ill.  Sometimes, like my kid.  (I think there needs to be a lot).  Mega in the studio.  It is.  Word up, y’all.  Trudeau.  (I can feel it)
[Voicemail Skit: Female Speaker]
Hi, daddy.  [On the way back?] [?].  Now it’s been like a fucking hour.  OK.  That’s all.  Call me back

[Hook: Beba, LJ, Luminisah, and Rashida and (C-Rayz Walz)]
I don’t know what you looking for
But I just stepped in the door
C-Ray-Z (Yeah, ma.  I’m here now)
C-Ray-Z (Yeah, sis.  I’m here now)

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
(I wanna) stop seeing you fags when I’m reading these mags
(I wanna) slip in your house, sit on the couch with the beam on the mat
(I wanna) invite you tuna flakes to my kumite
Then ride on ‘em and slide on ‘em with Puma skates
(I wanna) get brain like vain in the sex chronicles
(I wanna) spit flame like Kane and Nas at the barbeque
(I wanna) smash crews to particles, newsflash to articles
And honor you with hip hop that becomes a part of you
(I wanna) break down harmonics with sonic scream phoenixes
(I wanna) do it ‘til I’m done/dun like my sons from Queensbridge
(I wanna) flow, slashing crowds with classic sounds
So we don’t firetrucks to help these cats get down
(I wanna), via cancer of a answer, kill dickheads with prostates
(I wanna) shine and burn like [subwoof?] mixed with phosphate
(I wanna) get dough from a covenant to overthrow the government
Like, “Ba da ba ba ba”

[Hook: Beba, LJ, Luminisah, and Rashida and (C-Rayz Walz)] (x2)
I don’t know what you looking for
But I just stepped in the door
C-Ray-Z (Yeah, ma.  I’m here now)
C-Ray-Z (Yeah, sis.  I’m here now)

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
(I wanna) hear a RBG record with street heat going plat-plat
(I wanna) bang like MTA workers that be on track-track
(I wanna) free Mumia, but I need neon gats
To put the beast on track, clap back.  But beyond that
(I wanna) check my man into a rehab ‘cause his flow is so fluid
(I wanna) start talking to Joe—right now, I’m about to go do it
(I wanna) have peoples with conversations I ain’t say nothing to
(I wanna) sell corner on the crack—in fact, what you wanna do?
(I wanna) MJ, Naomi, Teresa, Caprice
LJ, Kim, Luminisa chromiest peeps
(I wanna) stop saying, “Aw, man,” and say, “All women
Need to be respected.”  When connecting, man, that’s what I’m doing
(I wanna) see ladies shake memories while these males analyze
(I wanna) see sisters Shogun/show gun like female samurai
(I wanna) tell you if you thought we was nuns, nah, we just listen to God
And you’re pissing him off with all your false renditions of the Lord
Come on!

[Hook: Beba, LJ, Luminisah, and Rashida and (C-Rayz Walz)] (x2)
I don’t know what you looking for
But I just stepped in the door
C-Ray-Z (Yeah, ma.  I’m here now)
C-Ray-Z (Yeah, sis.  I’m here now)

[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]
(I wanna) carry a Glock, but I don’t wanna go pop (Pop)
(I wanna) squash the beef with them creeps in the donut shop (Stop!)
(I wanna) live forever through my music like Biggie and Pac
Get cheddar quickly like 50 without the history shots
(I wanna) have fun making music ‘cause this ain’t my job
(I wanna) show I’m on my Jove ‘cause life is hard
(I wanna) say, “Independence the way,” so what’s really the deal?
And that’s gangsta ‘cause, yo, Ellie was ill
(I wanna) acknowledge my two ‘cause the truth is one (One)
(I wanna) show the style is deadly/dead Lee like Bruce’s son (Bruce’s son)
(I wanna) get props for booking, never stop the juxing
Let you taste my flavor if you ever thought The Rock was cooking (The Rock was cooking)
(I wanna) politick like Al Sharpton—my track record is fat
(I wanna) lie hits on the market, my competitors’ laps
(I wanna) big house with a fireplace, driveway and I’m good (What?)
Now let me stop fronting ‘cause I ain’t really nothing but hood (Nothing but hood)

[Hook: Beba, LJ, Luminisah, and Rashida and (C-Rayz Walz)] (x2)
I don’t know what you looking for
But I just stepped in the door
C-Ray-Z (Yeah, ma.  I’m here now)
C-Ray-Z (Yeah, sis.  I’m here now)

[Outro: C-Rayz Walz, ([?]), and Voicemail Skit]
[C-Rayz Walz and ([?])]
Trudeau.  (Hahaha).  [Joseph?].  (Stop)
[Voicemail Skit: Male Speaker]
C-Rayz, what’s up?  What’s the deal?  You hanging?  It’s all right over here.  [?] every day [?] in what is known as the truth.  Similar to light, this is crazy like kids.  Yeah
