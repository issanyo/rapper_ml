[Verse 1: Big Mike Terror, Breez Evahflowin', C-Rayz Walz, L.I.F.E. Long, and Stelf Index]
[Breez Evahflowin’]
Yo, the high joker of no higher defense
We walk the tightrope of a barb wire fence
You renege.  Give me five books
‘Fore the Stronghold hit you with fifty-five hooks
[Stelf Index]
Lines you sink drown in the mid-sky
Drop Jack-Jack-Nine, a full deck to the chin
Bumble Bee stack, Deuces Wild in anything
Buy up game like PS2 Pikachu orangutan
[C-Rayz Walz]
Duck in the hole like Vietnam vets going for board
With a pen in my hand, grenade in my vocal chords
Us against them.  You know the name and the protocol
You approached the bridge hoping to fall before we brawl
You crazy late.  I’ll slap your baby face
After seven with a pack of Crazy Eights
[L.I.F.E. Long]
Build and destruct of a fallen card castle
On top, crushing cards sharp like anvils
Throw clubs but us Aces and Kings cancel
Scheming on Queens while whole teams get trampled
Stomped over while Panther freak with the sample
We slice domes and then leave the remains on top of the mantle
[Big Mike Terror]
(Rowdy flow!) Here we go.  We ‘a rep
(Tally ho!) Write y’all bitches a check
Pull your Bicycle.  Now you’re short a full deck
Calling me still ‘cause your partner got set
A ten of spades make us.  All these big cats flex
Smack the card table or I’m snapping your neck
[L.I.F.E. Long]
Tipsy while playing Gin Rummy, pulling squads’ cards
Skip, then make you draw four.  We bombard
Hit you with a reverse, watch blood disperse
Now your color’s red.  New hand—I’m dealing first
We wild cards kicking your ass with judo
I’m holding.  Last man standing, winning, yelling “Uno!”
[C-Rayz Walz]
Gritty trash.  You know math like Pitty Pat
We round-robin, foul mobbing, stealing the stack
Confinement Solitaire—straitjacket-ripping
Thunder hitting.  You struck pidgeons is underbitten
Talking to my partners like Charles “X” Xavier scanning
Touch the mic.  A Chinese cut your wrist and throw your hand in
[Stelf Index]
I declare War, split you then shuffle
Stronghold dealt you eight.  Brick Fist crack knuckles
[Breez Evahflowin’]
Holding the cards in a five-finger huddle
There must have been a Super Bowl Shuffle.  Big Game hand
To smack the taste and crack your crate
Like Kung Fu Joe and the Jack of Spades
Jacking for Black Panther beats
Pick a card and give it the part, rip the Heart of Fours
Spit the art of war.  King of all carnivores
Throw your hip up.  It’s a stick-up
[?]
[C-Rayz Walz]
Going to hit you, my version of the tidal recital
We rush Clubs full of Heart against my Diamond rivals
Cutting Spades with percussion blades. Discussion’s played
Talking corpse, you stay, then get punched in your bluffing face
[Stelf Index]
Concentrate, choose twos and touch it
Lost memory, want a pair of mammories—fuck it
She wrapped the box around this
But ended up in the next man’s hand—a card trick
[Big Mike Terror]
Niggas Go Fish, Queens play Hearts, and big wigs
Make these rappers draw four from now to Christmas
[L.I.F.E. Long]
Ace of Spades cutting sixes, nines, and tens
The God drops in as falling Sevens from heaven
[Big Mike Terror]
The card captor hold the Ace in the struggle
Playing ghetto rules, dropping multiples and doubles
Blackjacks catch ten years, then FreeCell
Three-Card Monte or games with three shells

[Verse 2: Poison Pen and Wiz]
[Wiz]
Bet your life I’ma walk with your chips, come to your house
Twist your wife, buy a dog for your kids
You fucking with Wiz.  Game face on
The game changed, holmes.  I’ll raise you fifty
[Poison Pen]
I got three Kings and two Aces with me
Twenty Gs up, I’ma play to sixty
[Wiz]
Dog, take it easy.  Lay low ‘til the place get busy
So we can take their money below.  It’s easy, believe me
[Poison Pen]
Believe me, ain’t no love, nigga, on my part
My deck’s missing thirteen cards, all of them hearts
Don’t wear yours on your sleeve.  Better know when to toss in
It’s like playing Spades and bidding blind portions
[Wiz]
Life’s a gamble.  We got mock decks
[Poison Pen]
Extra cards
[Wiz]
You feel there’s a problem?
[Poison Pen]
My niggas deal strictly from the bottle
[Wiz]
Slam my brick fist down
[Poison Pen]
Yeah.  We’ll break your table in half
[All]
Play 52 Pick Up with that!
