[Intro (Overlapped with Hook Adlibs): C-Rayz Walz]
Spin around.  The reverse project theory.  Oxymoron.  [?].  [?].  Nagasaki Blaze.  C-Rayz Walz.  Plain Pat.  Double 9.  The same thing to splash you all with.  New soup, cooking it up

[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
My style’s [?] like, “Who’s Jerry love and [?]?”
Guns?  I carry some.  Hoes?  You married ‘em
Cops’ Glocks is hot.  My whole block got dumdums
With a 41-shot mentality.  Fucking with me
You’d rather go to court and get blunted
Join a covenant, do ten hits for five-hundred
You thought life is so sweet and simple
Now you in jail with holes in your cheeks like dimples
You know the real.  I’m nice enough to get ten deals
Trife enough to write, cook glass, and smash your windshield
On some Bronx shit, a “Hok” spit like [?]
Jedi-mind-trick your clique like [?]
Rap cats get smacked with gats—I instill fear
Y’all make no moves like ski teams in wheelchairs
Put you in cornfields with crows to scare some
I stab tracks—Plain Pat swear I got a spear tongue

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
Verbal spit gigantically stomp your gerbil myth
Murderous be the mode of the herbalist
C-Rayz Walz hip hop, lyrical material
A bonus to your mental

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
I fight the beast.  Earth cheers and eggs me on
My feet tired and I’m headstrong—the perfect balance
Maintain, making movements against the malice
Attracting a-alikes using my power as a magnet
Save Wonderland for Alice—hands on the chalice
Caressing my palm, calloused from smacking white mountains
To make the rocks come tumbling down with a thunderous sound, you need practice
I drink chamomile and rose hips
Make imbeciles walk tightropes with they toes clipped
Cut your hands off, make you juggle balloons
Rebuttal buffoons, use civilization for heirlooms
C-Rayz hit you in your mouth.  Your tongue blisters
Turn your bigger brother to your young sister (What?)
I’ve been underground so long, my favorite food is rubble
Drown myself just to see if I could bubble
Drink a drop of water and spit out a puddle
Brave enough to look hate in the face and say, “I love you”
Wild like a caveman—don’t make me club you
Like S.O.B., [?] speed or the tunnel

[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)
Verbal spit gigantically stomp your gerbil myth
Murderous be the mode of the herbalist
C-Rayz Walz hip hop, lyrical material
A bonus to your mental
