[Verse 1 – C-Rayz Walz]
{yawning}
That was the realest yawn
Step up, make a move, I'll kill your illest spawn
And still it's on (it's on) ‘cause life is chess
I am the king, the queen moves like Elliott Ness
And you don't want potholes in your chest from a lawn dart
In N.Y., kids shoot for nothin' like John Starks
And I'm off the bench ‘cause the cops is coming
You're a smart kid from the hood—yeah, my block is dumbin'
Damn, if looks could kill
My ice grill would pay for dinner while my punchlines foot the bill

[Verse 2 – Vast Aire]
They say great minds think alike.  Hands that ticker
The truth is… Fools seldom differ
Think fast ‘cause somebody's thinkin' quicker
I figure I be that whiskey in ya liver

[Verse 3 – C-Rayz Walz]
A thin line between Hell and where the hell's that?
The streets eat cats like the beast from Melmack
In time, you'll see your reflection in the face of the watch
And your counterclockwise direction of pacin' the block
Thunderbird, Night Train flame, wonder through herb
Ah, wonderful world, it's a wonderful word
This is elevator music on acid trip
Break the cycle—we don't do pop or classic hits
The bastard spits so good, the 'burbs know we so hood
Chop it up, put you in the forest—you should go wood
The verse is ugly, the hoods look ill
So I'm a retard that hits streets hard like Bushwick Bill

[Verse 4 – Vast Aire]
When you learn how to walk on water and spit fire
They say that's pretend.  Stupid
You wanna play with death?
Forget the whales, you better save your breath

[Verse 5 – C-Rayz Walz]
Once upon a time, second beyond the space in the outer
Thundershower, son radiate grace
Over the counter at C-Rayz underscore
On your mark, they set to go and end the race with war
Monkey see, forget how monkeys do
When they hang with gorillas and become one of the crew
With bandanas and boots they turn to cobras—it's bananas but true
They money see and see money as truth
Those eye dollar trees bleed coinless fruit
You got the gall to score, but you don't got the balls to shoot

[Verse 6 – Vast Aire]
When the deads walk in, we'll see who's liver
Ordered a Bloody Mary, woke up with a screwdriver
The final calls sounds, elephant guns, clown the hungry
You can't pin Armageddon on the tail of a donkey
