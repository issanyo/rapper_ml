[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
For life (money is the key)

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Livin' in LA where everything goes
I would rather have my cash 'cause friends become foes

[Verse 1: Ganjah K]
That's why my number one priority is my denero
I'm not a nigga without no brain like the scarecrow
I'm thinkin' wisely, lookin' behind me
For the sucka punch of some nigga that try to surprise me
You can't deny me nothing in this lifetime
As long as I keep my game tight and keep writing rhymes
I put in my work full time, it's forever gon' pop
Cause only the sun and the moon is my time clock
Can get crazier than Murdoch, but prefer not
To blow my fuse unless I'ma do's a murder
You got to give a player space
Cause even players shoot when they in a hot pursuit paper chase
I love the ladies, plus I love my people, black
But all I know for a motherfucking fact

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Livin' in LA where everything goes
I would rather have my cash 'cause friends become foes
Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Livin' in LA where everything goes
I would rather have my cash 'cause friends become foes

[Verse 2: Ganjah K]
Now, even if I had them superhero powers
A nigga still gotta make them Shapiro dollars
But first thang, you got to obtain game to maintain
Everytime I flip my set my ends come back like a boomerang
First Brigade is what I claim, yeah we entertain
But they scared to put a bullet in your brain, it's a strain
Doing illegal to become legal
Livin' do or die but keepin' your eye on own people
Cause everybody livin' low but don't know
If a nigga get hungry how far he will go
Or what he would do, will he get you from behind?
Just to make it through his hard times
Two shots to the back of the head
Ask the nigga why he did it and all the fool's said

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Livin' in LA where everything goes
I would rather have my cash 'cause friends become foes
Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Livin' in LA where everything goes
I would rather have my cash 'cause friends become foes

[Verse 3: Ganjah K]
Cause to me it's about damn persevering
Can't be like all the other on the sideline cheering
No pompoms, but I keep the bomb-bomb
That shit that'll make you quit before you're coughing up a lung
Keepin' up with my income as I master game
And advise all the peoples around me, to do the same
Cause if you're livin' for women and laughs, you won't have
Just all the time crying about what you don't have
That's why my every move is calculated
Don't trip, or get your whole life amputated
I'm designated to be on top
And gon' keep puttin' it down until this rollercoaster stop

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Livin' in LA where everything goes
I would rather have my cash 'cause friends become foes
Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Livin' in LA where everything goes
I would rather have my cash 'cause friends become foes
Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Livin' in LA where everything goes
I would rather have my cash 'cause friends become foes

[Outro: Ganjah K]
Puttin' it down with my niggas from the Pound
D-A-Z (DPG)
My nigga Snoop Dogg (for life)
(DPG)
Yeah, the homie Supafly (for life)
Sayin' what's up to the First Brigade?
Mark the Murderah (and you know that)
The homeboy Napalm (the bomb)
From the Westside (for life)
