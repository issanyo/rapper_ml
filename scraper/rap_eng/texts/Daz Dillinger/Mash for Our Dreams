Verse 1: [Storm]
They say I'm goin' out off my mind
Complete the potion, homicidal blindness
Gotta buck with a mission to violence
To please the silence
Hear the whispers of my fo'-five
Disturbed from struggles
The thuggest in us, it can never bound us
Who can I trust, don't give a fuck
I'm out to get the juice and take the bucks
Hit 'em up, with the (?) why they murder us
But when the tear drops, and the few you bleedin'
So and let go
And feel
Fuck the famous, all about the game and the deal
Cause it is me (?superextraflibberous dixtoted?) when my finger hits
The shit in every move I make
Legit with every cooler break
Concentration never broke and not a single word spoken
Until I greet 'em smokin', leave 'em chokin'
That's some wide open
Dear diary
Forgive me Father I'm a don breed
Check me with Hail-Mary's
And pray that I won't crush my seed
Crush my bloody sequency
Consume me with Hennesey
Cause I'mma do this to death
Until my final breath, leave me

Chorus "1": [Daz Dillinger]
Who the fuck can stop me when I mash for our dreams
Me, Noble, Daz and Storm, mamash for our dreams
Al my gangbang niggas better mash for our dreams
Who the fuck can stop me when I mamash for our dreams
Haha, all my niggas in jail mash for our dreams
All my essays, y'all we mash for our dreams
Who the fuck can stop me when I mash for my dreams
Mash for your dreams, nigga mash for your dreams

Verse 2: [Storm]
Ah, Hell
Another killer see from the firm g's
Mission to be the baddest Outlaw from the baby rattle
Looking in the shadows, mind over matter
Conditions to splatter
Enemies comin' for me in battle
I raise my hand and Outlaw
No one before has took the torch
Now motherfuckers gonna feel my wrath in war
I got some itchy finger trippin' niggers ready for war (OUTLAWZ)
We even in the score, checking out your ranks and boats
Come back and feel the force
Reckon Outlawz, like we're yours
Are you a friend or fo'
Empty your mind reveal the truth mo'
On the mash for glory, never control
Forfill my prophet's final story
Get an eye for me, ride for me
Make 'em sorry and recognize who'll die for me
It ain't over till you breathin' in me
As a blblast for the dreams

Chorus "2": [Daz Dillinger]
Mamamamamamamamash for our dreams
Haha, mamash, mash, mash, mash for our dreams
Yeah
All my niggas they better mash for our dreams
Don't stop, don't quit better (mamash, mash, mash) mash for our dream
All my niggas in jail mash for our dreams (Mamamash for our dreams)
All my niggas who died mash for our dreams (Mamamash for our dreams)

Verse 3: [Young Noble]
Mash for our dreams
Peep the scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kinda cloudy, smoked out with no cavi
Won't work, it's over here nigga (Over here nigga)
Make sure when you diss a motherfucker make it clear nigga
They sent me on O-U-T-LAW you
Style is straight garbage
Spittin' that nonsense
Rap packing on contact
Instantly, rhyme for rhyme
Who wanna scrimmage me
Thicker tempt then me
You're just a saggy as a Wallabee
And obviously I'm stiff and strict with it
Bitches ride dick and say: "Got a nigga sick with it"
Stick to the real shit
Flow slower than (?)
Vicinity mixed, if he can't
It only didn't rain clear
Jock the VN for Joe Clair
Original done clock with no fear
Shout out to be the eye
Put on necks yo by Idi Amin
For green, niggas shaking, it ain't never seen my whole team
Secret to war, Outlawz rush the floor
Kill the Kadafi, thug in peace
You get caught slippin', get blood in the streets (More 4x)
Even if you're packin' yours
Lost souls perform fo'-fo's
Y-O-U-N-G, N-O-B-L-E
Mash for new streets
Slugger, eat MC's like meatloaves (Ssssshhhhhttttt)
For that they wanna blast and put a fast one in ya
Knowin' I puff, then walk around with Pac' acid in me
Get just as dirty as birth
Or maybe ever worse son
Stressed like niggas but no checks on the first
Mob dude told me it was gonna be days like this
The dude never told me how to get paid like this
I mash for my dreams

Chorus "3": [Daz Dillinger]
Who can stop me when I mash for our dreams
(Mamash, mash, mash, mash for our dreams)
All my new niggas alive better mash for our dreams
All my Outlaw niggas better mash for our dreams
(Mamamamamamamamash for our Dreams)
And all my gangbang niggas better mash for our dreams
(Mamash, mash, mash, mash for our dreams)
Haha, Who can stop us when we mash for our dreams
Death Row brought us some life, mash for our dreams
Everywhere we go we mash on, mamamash for our dreams
Who the fuck can stop me when I'll be (When I'll be)
(Mamamash for our dreams, mamamash for our dreams)
Haha, Daz Dillinger mash for our dreams
Miss Storm yo we mash for our dreams
(Mamash, mash, mash, mash for our dreams)
Young Noble yo we mash for our dreams
Mash for our dreams, Mash for our dreams

Outro: [Daz Dillinger]
Yeah, who the fuck can stop us (Mash for our dreams)
Death Row in your ass (Mash for our dreams)
And every time you see us (Mamamash for our dreams)
Give us respect
