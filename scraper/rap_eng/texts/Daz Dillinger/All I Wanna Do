Yeah, oooh
I been in some situations
Where I could have done you wrong
But I made up in my mind
Want to keep what we have strong

Got a man that puts up with me
And I hated it when I lie
About things that don't even matter
And I don't know the reason why

[Chorus: ]
You're on my mind, (mmm) all the time (time)
Up the things that we used to do
When you and me back when we
And I'm lost without your love
And all I want to do is share my love with you (share my love)
And all I want to do is prove my love to you (prove it, to you)

So that we are still together
Know I took you through some pain
Even though I didn't notice
I want to make it up to you
Give me one more chance to show you
What I really want to do
Baby, baby

[Chorus: ]
You know that I only want you
To bring back the sunshine into my life
I can't decide the things that you do to me
This is what I want to do

[Chorus: ]
