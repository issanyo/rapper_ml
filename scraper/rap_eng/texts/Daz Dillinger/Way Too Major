[Daz]
Ready?
Yeah... we back
Daz Dillinger in the game
Death Row, in the house
Lettin y'all know, we ain't went nowhere, we right here
In effect, c'mon

Ahh yeah, watch out, get ready for war
We the Gang and we bang knockin down your door
What's the secrets of war I can't take no more
Within minutes we get in it comin for you and yours
With these automatic toys throughout the world make noise
Dippin in low-lows, and jumpin out of fo'-do's
Catchin, many and any with the fo'-fo'
Blastin and mashin, outcastin many for Death Row
Rest in peace to my homeboys who ain't alive
Now the mission is for us to conquer and ride
The worst California we droppin somethin on ya
Ain't no warnin sign, like cha-pow, you a goner
For the simple fact we get Gang Related
We have the papers and you suckers hate it
What you gon do when we get loose and act a fool
Break the rules on you and dust you off with the tools

[Hook: Tray Deee]
Yeah, you know I ain't nuttin but a gangsta
Only with the swoll rolls and the paper
Once I get the big bank, gotta shake her
Cause I'm tryin to get way too major
(repeat 2X)
*singing* And you know we really like to get down
With the Gangsta Boogie
(repeat 2X)

[Dat Nigga Daz]
I penetrate, send it straight to your middle brain
Three times dope similar to my nickname
A big Caine, ain't nuttin changed now I'm solo
My gangsta ass track with the Gang is my logo
Ridin with the top down, off lockdown
Time for me to knock down fool's whole compound
Like the World Trade Center
The world made thinner when I'm pullin' on my pearl grey trigger
Figure when I enter I intend to rule this
This industry fin to see I'm nuttin to fool wit
Like Jack Nicholson, I smack fickle men
And pack somethin in my penalty
Will well then they see the type of serve that I put down
In a moment's notice my opponents get took down
A crook down for my crown with clout
Representin Death Row when I was down and out
It don't stop

[Hook]

[Daz Dillinger]
I came in the game with the aim to maim
The gangbang murder main slang is strange
My first idea when I stare up in the mirror
Is how Daz Dillinger gon creep up on the scrilla
And if I don't plot then I'll probably not
Get my issue, so I gotta figure how to twist you
Hit you hard like a gauge shot
Watchin fools laid out when the bloodshot sprayed out
I shoot my way out these punks for rent
So duck when the slugs hit your trunks, you're finished
I'm comin out runnin out so shake the scene
Break the green I'll scream out the gangsta theme
Do or die! Ain't no lie, that's the way I eat
Watch me scope out and choke out the prayout beat
GIve me six in the chamber fuck twelve in the box
Let the gravedigger be the one shovelin rocks, it don't stop

[Hook]

[Daz]
This how we live, ballin on y'all
Fancy cars and houes
*singing 1X again*
Yeah, and you know we got this, so don't trip, ha ha
Yeah, and you know that
Yeah, real smoove
Straight up, we got get down
Gangsta, and we major
And we doin, watch out
*singing 2X again*
Death Row, Daz Dillinger
