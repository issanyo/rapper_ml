(*talking*)
Yeah, Daz Dilinger, E.S.G., Slim Thug
Doing it up real big, ha-ha
What's going down my nigga

[E.S.G.]
Let me see you holla-holla, if you love the summer time
Hit the detail shop, get your drop top shine
Ain't no subways here, it's thugs down here
20 inch dubs, what we love down here
The best part of year, bout the end of May
Now the best thing to see, MLK on Sunday
Candy spray on gray, playing Playstation 2
Looking good when I come through, I smell barbecue
E.S.G. true-true, pop roof purple Sprite
Sin in the Benz, rims circle at the light
Cardier filled with ice, got a cooler full of comas
Say playboy, you know the blades are the old ones
AME's, on the SUV's
DVD's, with the five T.V.'s
Maaan, off the showroom flo'
I love the thug life, boy you already know

[Hook: Mike Wilson]
I wanna ride with you, Southside
That sticky green I'm looking clean, let's ride
I wanna floss with you, Northside
From H-Town to L.A

[Daz]
See ain't no feeling like it's feeling, when you balling and you chilling
Stacking chips by the minute, see the hoes straight grinning
Hit the 59, puffing a pound
Hit the 6-10, now I'm in the wind again
Hit up E.S.G. and Slim Thug, prolly smoke rims up
So fresh and so clean, I hit couple my friends up
Now a G at St. Claire what's up Sin (heey)
The sticky Mary do way, everyday all day
I'm so serious about it no doubt it, if you a G straight shout it
Put your pistols in the air, and be about it
This way and that way, sideways on the highway
Motherfucker, I do it my way
You see what you see, is just what you get
E.S.G. and Slim Thug and Daz, dropping gangsta shit

[Hook]

[Slim Thug]
The sunshine got me tan, while I head to the sand
Top down music playing, wood grain in my hand
It's summer time, so I feel like I gotta shine
Candy do's glass 4's, with the fifth reclined
Popping trunks on swang, is how we clown in that Tex
From my wrist to neck, I'm invisible sets
Nothing less, Slim Thug the flow pro rapper
As I head to the Kappa, 4 swangas and adapters
(turning heads while we crawl, up and down the C-Wall)
From now on my mind set, to just ball ball ball
I hit the mall like whatever, what I want I get
I never run out of cheddar, cause my stash too thick
From H-Town to L.A., L.A. to V.A
Represent where you're staying, let me see how you play
Now make way for the city, that love to po' up
Cause H-Town and Boss Hogg, is about to blow up

[Hook]

See what you see, is just what you get
It's just that Thug and Daz, dropping gangsta shit

(*talking*)
Biatch yeah, E.S.G., Slim Thug, Daz Dillinger
Running the South, the North, the West, the East yeah
Put your hands up, all my bitches put your hands up
Real gangstas put your hands up, yeah
