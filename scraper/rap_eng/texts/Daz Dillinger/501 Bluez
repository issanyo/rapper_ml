[Intro]
Yeah, when I get out
I want you to give me some 5-0-1 blues
A fresh white T-shirt
Some motherfucking black chucks
And a motherfucking golf hat
Yeah, I'm touching down nigga
And when I get out, it's on nigga
Yeah

[Hook]
Some nigga's switch in the game
But i'm never gone change
I'm a keep it gangster till the death of me
You know my name
I can never turn my back on the streets that made me
I'm a young nigga to a triple O.G
Ain't never met a nigga that can walk in my shoes
I stay creased up in my 5-0-1 blues

[Verse 1] Daz
Nigga
I'm creased out
I'm starch heavy
I'm G'd up
Bouncing about the Chevy
Grey 5-0-1's, black chucks I'm the one
Easier say they come, nigga
Easy say they none
Walk the street with no worry
Another gang story
How to trample the weak
Nigga, how the strong glory
5's them the black on black Levi's
And hella smoke, nigga
As I blow it in your skeez-eye
Keep it original
Me and my nigga Koka' house shoes
Romeo nigga old school loafers
Tote' that thing in my back pocket
That's what I'm saggin'
Easy for me to whip it out and start blasting
Laughing at you suckers
Cause you don't know how to dress
Never the less, nigga
My nigga's bumping fresh
We flexing, no motherfucking questions
5-0-1 blues when a nigga steppin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2] Kokane
Blue hanky in the left side of my pocket
44 mag in the back
When a nigga cock' it
Now take that tight shit off
Some of y'all don't get it
Nigga's walking round with their legs looking anorexic
Then you turn around, got the never to act so hard
Nigga's in them skinny jeans is looking like some retards
I'm in my 5-0-1's, baddest nigga on the scene
Keep it loose fit, gotta let my nuts swing
I'm creased out
I stay fly
I stay high sagging in my Levi's
That nigga Koke' and Daz
It's all original
But some of these nigga's talk
Be looking like they wear rainbows
You's a silly hoe, hella colour full
But I keep the pep's on the bottom of my romeo's
When I hit club
Gank attire when I bust
Take the tight jeans off
That don't represent the west, like euhh

[Hook]

[Outro]
Nigga, everyday all day nigga
Fresh out, looking fresh than a motherfucker
That nigga daz, kokane all day everyday, uhh
5-0-1's nothing less nothing more
Khaki's will do
But 5-0-1's
Keeping em' blue, black, grey
You know
All the fresh shit, biatch
