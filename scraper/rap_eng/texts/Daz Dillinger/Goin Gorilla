Yea
I like it when you bitches get gorilla
Oh man
I woke up early this morning, with a bed full of bitches
You know the night before I had em goin gorilla
Had this little vanilla, you know she rollin it nigga
You know she wanted to sprout, so go blaze up a switcher
She had the urge to try, super found some liquor
I told er nasty, she knew I wanted my dick up
So she introduced me to her best friend’s sister
I said how ya doin, my name Daz Dillie
And started takin straight shots, to get her fucked up quicker
So I knew from the jump in I be jumpin up in her
I was beatin it up, face down, ass up
Because that’s the way the real nigga like to fuck
So I took er bout that pussy, started rockin the crowd
Row full of bad bitches, they all goin wild
They already know I’mma style, goin all for that loud
Light em up guaranteed, I be knockin er down
I got er goin gorillas, goin gorillas
Goin goin gorillas, goin goin gorillas
Goin gorillas, goin gorillas
Goin goin gorillas, goin goin gorillas
Goin gorillas, goin gorillas
Goin goin gorillas, goin goin gorillas
Goin gorillas, goin gorillas
Goin goin gorillas, goin goin gorillas
She got a mouth full of smoke, blow it in the street
They say I’m epic by the way I flow, killa beta it
Got 2 Glocks talk shit, nigga let it spit
Ain’t no strength into the street, I’m bout this G shit
Catch me coming out, first round drop it
With my big guns buy myself a motherfuckin mansion
Yea I’m shittin on these niggas who be talkin
Ridin like a AK, leave em in the coffin
Let the devil off from off that gnarly green dolphin
Like the Olsen twins, proceed my block with caution
Yea we off them green god
That we lowride
It’s how we do it motherfucker on this side
Like the green thug, my status is my mind state
I bought a big booty bitch up on my birthday
All you gotta do is buzz me in when you see my face
I ain’t worried bout the word, that’s why a nigga hit at they
Ride here to lick and taste, vibe to the shit I say
I got em got em goin goin crazy like a ape, you get there
Goin gorillas, goin gorillas
Goin goin gorillas, goin goin gorillas
Goin gorillas, goin gorillas
Goin goin gorillas, goin goin gorillas

Goin goin gorillas, goin goin gorillas

Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Say what? A bad bitch on the loose nigga
