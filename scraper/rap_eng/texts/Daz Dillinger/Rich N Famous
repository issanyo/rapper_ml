[Hook: Daz Dillinger]
Lifestyle of the rich n famous
Some die with a name, some die nameless
I gotta get it while I'm here
Can't get it when I die
So as long as I'm breathing I'm gonna ride, nigga (X2)

[Verse 1: Daz Dillinger]
It's been a long time coming
I'm still doing my shit
On the road doing shows coming back with a grip
Ain't shit gonna stop me from tryna get the money
Everyday I'm tryna eat, it's all work no sleep nigga
Riding through life all alone and no [taxes?]
I'm a vet on the set, I don't fuck with no amatuers
Gotta keep it how you live, and that's just how it is
In the land of the lost, I'm the first to take off
All rules still apply in the life we live
When it comes to the money you can die for a bitch
See I stay on my shit, I'm never trusting a bitch
Tryna set a nigga up and after rat a nigga up, in this life

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
I played and win in this game called life, homie
I'm Daz Dillinger nigga, YES the one and only
I've been about this life since day one
And I never walk the streets without a fucking gun
Never knowing when that day gon be coming
So when that day comes I'm going down gunning
I'm never running, I'm first nigga on the frontline
Code of the streets, is never drop a dime
I'mma ride till I can't ride no mo'
In the blaze of glory, I'm the front page story
I go hard in the [ping?] when it comes down to it
Don't think a nigga won't when I will do it

[Hook X2]

[Verse 3: Daz Dillinger]
It's time to ride on my enemies
Even riding on the ones that's fake friends to me
As I take a hit of the blunt, I'm in deep thought
Cold-blooded type of nigga, I got no heart
My mind state tryna raise up the crime rate
It's time to separate the real from the real fake
I've shaken up the city like a earthquake
Even after shots tearing down your fucking block
If you don't stand for something you gon' fall for anythang
Gang recognize gang, nigga better bang
Gang recognize gang, nigga better bang
If you don't stand for something you gon' fall for anythang
