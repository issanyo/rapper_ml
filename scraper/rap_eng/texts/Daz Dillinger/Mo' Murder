[Chorus: Daz]
Mo' murder, mo' murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder, mo' murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder, mo' murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder, mo' murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder murder

[Verse 1: Daz]
The price of dying is cheap, nowadays it's like
We kill you a hundred million different ways
The scene yesterday, I was pushing a coupe, on the celly with Snoop
Bring out the guns, nigga, call the troops
It's how my niggas do it for loot, we pack them cannons
And we down to shoot, 21 gun salute
In the hood it's like Beirut
In a route to recruit them little soldiers by the age of two
You a muthafuckin' gangsta, show them why
You blast me, I blast you, fuck you gotta decide
24 hours later somebody mom done died
That's the way we do shit when you're born to ride
It's mo' murder, mo' murder, it's a homicide
It's 2009 and young niggas survive
Don't keep a quarter ounce, nigga, 'cause I gotta stay high
You ask me a question, I don't know why

[Chorus: Daz]
Mo' murder, mo' murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder, mo' murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder, mo' murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder, mo' murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder murder

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
I got a Brinks on my mind, plus I got a plan to go get it
I'm with my niggas, we with it
It's just the end of the world, marks, mask up, mayne
Nigga load up e'ry muh'fuckin' thang
Seeing clearly, my eyes keen and sharp
Impervious eagle vision, beam and hawk
Got about three homies me with the beam and caulk
Let's begin, first team, scheme and walk
Inside, before I even make a sound
And come out and start laying muthafuckas down
I think what I used to think before I learned how to shoot
Keep your eyes on the prize, nigga, do what you do
We roll through the streets with shit that crack vaults
More murder, more money, we shootin' for money
If you try to take it from me, you'll see about 80 from me
On niggas' heels, busta niggas tryna take from me

[Chorus: Daz]
Mo' murder, mo' murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder, mo' murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder, mo' murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder, mo' murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder murder

[Verse 3]
[Daz]
It's a blessing to be living to see another day
Jacked up around the way, he got blown away
You take a chance past 12 o'clock, shootin' up the party
This one nigga I heard inhaled the shot
Siren, the police surrounded his body
But he still got shot at Bebe's party
Now he loading up the G-unit in, barrel spin
And all the witness could say that they saw a black Benz

[Kurupt]
Nigga, you'll never be able to stop this frontline pushin'
Paragraphs of pure poison power in the bushes
All by pure nature, villain, famine
Scandalous Los Angeles scoundrel
Dismantle the heat and re-assemble it, quick and fast
Show you two times then put it to your face and blast
The homies all around with metal and contraband
Stickin' to the muthafuckin' plan, settle and watch this van
Mo' murder

[Chorus: Daz]
Mo' murder, mo' murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder, mo' murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder, mo' murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder, mo' murder, mo' murder murder
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder murder
