Is this what you want?
Is this what you need?
I got what you want
I got what you need
This what I got, you're fuckin' with me
When we fuck, laugh, shop and eat

[Daz Dillinger]
All we do is fuck, laugh (ha ha!) Shop and eat
Do your major thang girl, I see you out on the street
I'll meet up with ya later, same thing as before
You're talkin' shit, poppin' a bottle and puffin' the dro
The type of nigga you need, I'm it
And you're the type of the woman I need, so thick
Strict with the convo, let me illustrate
Don't hurry up girl, don't make no mistake
Come back, lay it down, get it all over
We'll fuck, laugh, shop and eat (I told ya!)
68 I owe ya one, show ya how it's done
I'm Diggy fuckin' Daz and you know I want some
Jeans fittin' tight, it's just my type
We do it all day, we do it all night
It's D-A-Z in the place to be
And I got what you want, you got what I need

[Daz Dillinger]
I see you lookin' at me out the corner of your eye
Do it look like I got money, cause baby girl you're fly
Big shrimp, big steak (woo!) big lobster
Anything besides that, I got ya
With a whole lot of this and a whole lot of that
I'll have your pussy swoll up and have you on your back
I need the new Air Force's, brand-new Porsche
Eight bedroom house with the marble floors and
If you dick 'em good you get treated good, that's my remedy
I laugh at these hoes who try to get with me
I keep it cool, cause I'm no fool
I spit words like the mac, I'm from the old school
With diamonds on my finger, pinky ring so sick
Maserati, I need that to come with the whole kit
I need that, my main bitch spoil me
She been down for years, I call the shit loyalty

[Redman]
I hop out the Cadillac, Red what's up
A nigga like me better handcuff her
Cause I don't play homie, I got swagger
Out of line, I got the iron right by the bladder
Tough guy, nah, say I'm on fire
I don't love them hoes, you tryin' to wife 'em
Old people say "Redman, I don't like him"
Weed same color as a Minnesota Viking
Yeah nigga, I swear nigga
The real hip-hop's about to air nigga
I'm hood down, you Hollywood Square nigga
You wanna learn then pull up a chair nigga
I'm too hot for TV, back again
When I'm in your hood, nigga what's happenin'?
When I roll through pass the gin
Cause I already got the juice, who the fuck is you?
