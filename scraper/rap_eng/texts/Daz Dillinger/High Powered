[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yo, yo, what's up?
Yo, man, give me some of that old, gangsta-ass shit, you know what I'm saying?
Some shit I can just kick back and smoke a fat-ass joint to, you know what I'm saying?
Hell yeah, know what I'm talking about?
I like that old gangsta shit
Cause you know it's a lot of niggas out there
Woofing all that bullshit talking 'bout they got this and got that
Talking louder than a motherfucker but ain't saying shit
You know what I'm saying?
