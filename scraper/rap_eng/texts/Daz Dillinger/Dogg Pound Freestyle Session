[Kurupt]
There's a lot of people out there that be talking all that
But I could kick a fat fat type of known rap
See, when you talk all that, you know I like to show up
Niggas think they cocaine, knowing that they blow up
Peep where I come from, so you know it's on
Because I brought these nuts, cause I'm all above the law
So when you see me stepping, understand I like to flow
The Pound, Dr. Dre, we equal Death Row

[Daz]
Now you know about me
The D to the A to the Z
S-N-double O-P, D-R-E
That nigga, um, Doctor Dre
So we say like every day
Now it's that P-O-U-N-D, uh

[Kurupt]
Kurupt is the name that they call me
I flow and I flow with the Snoop Doggy Dogg
As a nigga make bigger waves, I start flexing
When niggas start stepping
Grip with my Tec and Snoop, kick it

[Daz]
If you're wicked, wicked I kick it
Slick and not with them condo hoes coochie, won't you lick it

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
It's like this
I don't eat them hoes cause I'm just so smooth..
Break the beat up for me..

Motherfucking Dr. Dre's on the piano
Snoop Doggy Dogg is on the vocals and I swing like soprano, ano
And gano -- oh my god like Obano
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg, he's on the mic, you understand it, yo
When I be growing, I be flowing with the gangsta shit
I don't be flowing with that punk-ass punk shit
I go for riz-eals, the reals is what I kick
And when I step into the house, I'm gonna hit you with the gangsta..fat hit
It just don't quit, like I told you
So let me have the microphone so I can slowly fold you
I told you, mold you, scold you like some water that's hot
Heat it, beat it, Snoop Dogg, you can't defeat it, delete it
I'm so smooth I don't have to dis you on the camera or the TV screen
I'm funky like some collard greens
I told you peoples, my sequels, they don't be bumping
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg, I'm down with D-R-E, see he's from Compton
And I'm from the L the O the N the G
The B the E the A the C the H an'
And Cali is the state an'
Don't be waitin'
Cause I'm not hatin'
I'm just on the microphone and I ain't perpetratin'
