[Intro: Kurupt & (Daz)]
My nigga Daz (My nigga Kurupt, what's up, mayne?)
Man, DPG, Dogg Pound in the buliding, yeah
You know it's about time that we came and hit y'all with some of that original G shit
Sup Snoop? I love you, cuz (Dogg Pound)

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
I'm so happy to see, the DPG, back in stride again
We finna ride again, dippin' and slidin' in
Chocolate Thai and Henn, Daz and Kurupt finna fly again
Monster mash, smashin' squads and packs
Straps and 'Lacs, half ounce and quarter pound sacks
Stacks and stacks, multitudes of nickels and Macs
Gangstas and macks, hoods
Bloods and Crips, Mexican Mafia, Latin Kings, Vice Lords, Disciples
Dogg Pound rock the gangsta revival
Ride with us, last night I was tweakin'
I was lit, trippin', mind on chip
On my right side, I had my 9 on chip
I was barely speaking and I saw this fly Puerto Rican
So pretty, so high saditty
Made a nigga smile and I ain't smiled in a while

[Chorus]
I wasn't even thinking about time
I wasn't even thinking 'bout my 9
All I wanna do is DPG
And keep it like that and hit donuts in the streets
I wasn't even thinking about time
I wasn't even thinking 'bout my 9
All I wanna do is DPG
And keep it like that and hit donuts in the streets

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
I'm in the '66 Impala, keep a pistol, don't bother
Keep a page full of dollars, all my niggas gotta holla
Pressure busts pipes, now the time is right
See, we might get gangsta by the end of the night
A pearly blue Chevy chromed out, sitting on dubs
I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta so show me some love
Bitch, you might catch a slug, get slumped and dumped on
I ain't stopping for gas, nigga, ride or get rode on
See, I've been waiting for this
Me and my nigga hooking back up with that gangsta shit
Hold this and bust with all your might, it's on tonight
Niggas they play and play fight now
(Dippin' up and down, bounce)

[Chorus]
I wasn't even thinking about time
I wasn't even thinking 'bout my 9
All I wanna do is DPG
And keep it like that and hit donuts in the streets
I wasn't even thinking about time
I wasn't even thinking 'bout my 9
All I wanna do is DPG
And keep it like that and hit donuts in the streets

[Verse 3]
[Daz]
I'm in a fresh sky blue, Corvette, Lamborghini, door set, strapped to the bone
33 like Tony Dorsett, you heard of Daz
Nigga, I'm first to run up, nigga, and first to blast
I'm throwing yardage like McNabb, hit hard when I jab
Muthafucka, well, that's just too bad

[Kurupt]
Me and the homie, we top dollar
Daz just got a droptop Impala
What a lovely California day
And next week we going to the A
Pentagon precision, the homie's swervin'
Nate just got a bomb Excursion
Warren G rollin' in a bomb Yukon
Kurupt and Dat Nigga Daz sick with squad two times
Snoop, and anybody that got a problem
Tell it to the nina while the spinners revolving, then I saw you

[Chorus]
I wasn't even thinking about time
I wasn't even thinking 'bout my 9
All I wanna do is DPG
And keep it like that and hit donuts in the streets
I wasn't even thinking about time
I wasn't even thinking 'bout my 9
All I wanna do is DPG
And keep it like that and hit donuts in the streets

[Outro: Kurupt & (Daz)]
Man (yeah), you know how you be rollin' (uh-huh)
You be rollin' with the homies, right? (Dogg Pound out)
And then you see that one piece (little bad bitch), man
And you ain't thinking about nothing else
But keeping it hood, being G'd up
Bangin' on bustas and crackin' that bitch
(Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, Kurupt)
Dogg Pound Gangstaz, back in effect
Yeah, we had problems
We've been through ups and downs
We've been all over the world
Opposite sides but we back to ride, yeah (DPG)

[Chorus]
I wasn't even thinking about time
I wasn't even thinking 'bout my 9
All I wanna do is DPG
And keep it like that and hit donuts in the streets
I wasn't even thinking about time
I wasn't even thinking 'bout my 9
All I wanna do is DPG
And keep it like that and hit donuts in the streets
