Soopafly: [Daz] (talking)

[Hey Soopafly I got a beat for ya]
Let me hear it
[ Check it out, you like that?]
Yeah, I like that
Now that's what the fuck I'm talkin' bout [ha]
[What you call it?]
I call that gangsta shit, nigga
Muthafucka I call it, What you call it?
Check it out

[Soopafly]
Awwww watch out
Who the man that stand 18 lockout
Thousand watts of power
Enough to take your whole block out
KABOOM the perfect cannibal
Hit you with some incredible
Ammunition to blast you when I let it go
I situate your whole state of thought
Leave with the feeling of being caught
If whether you like it or not
I bust and hush
Niggas crush, niggas don't say shit
Direct 'em all and check
[Who the hell are you?]
I'm super-fly-why? I stay high
Way high, mashin' on these niggas
'Til the day I die
Keep your heat and vest
Keep it on cocked
I built like blocks
Ballin' like you rockin' my jock
Will never slow the flow
Shit, never while I deliver the war
That you can't fuck wit'
You'll be actin' the nut
Approach the mic like 'whut up?'
Rock the crowd, havin' all the ho's with they butt up
Now you know the Top Gun
With the tops stop, run the flop
Keep bustin' 'til they all drop

Chorus:
Now if you down with this shit say Hell Ya [ Hell Ya!]
If you down with Soopafly say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
If you down to make a crip say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
If you down with smokin' shit say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
If you like to get high say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
If you like to get rich say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
If you like to fuck a bitch say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]

Hell Ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What U yellin'? [Hell Ya]

[Soopafly]
I take none, niggas fuck around
So I break one, hoochies so hard
Make you say [ Woo Woo!]
To rape one, eight ton, lyrical style
Never fake 'em like I'm from Puerto Rico
And Cuba to Jamaica
You be always asking for money
But never make none
Hot one, these niggas got me
Bustin' like a shotgun [ Bla!]
Top one drop you to the ground
Maneuver around, stop show
Who that nigga hangin' from a top row
I know the game is difficult
But the same muthafuckaz who reign
Ain't never ashamed to bring the pain
Cuz I'm gangsta
Niggas to all my niggas cuz I'm anxious
Waitin' for the bang and devastation
Check it out, I break a nigga down
To find a new route
If you doubt the ways
I can snatch yo' ass
With a nigga game and ride it, let me tap yo' ass
Now who is you
Soopafly [That nigga]
Like I'm Daz

Chorus:
Now if you down with this shit say Hell Ya [ Hell Ya!]
If you down with Soopafly say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
If you down to make a crip say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
If you down with smokin' shit say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
If you like to get high say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
If you like to get rich say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
If you like to fuck a bitch say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say Hell Ya
C'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And all my niggas yellin' Hell Ya!

[Tray Deee]
I be down for it all for the cause
Breakin' niggas jaws
Have 'em sippin' soup through straws
Raw Doggz, stompin' muthafuckaz in bras
Seen it all from the pen, back to juvenile hall
Takin' off, callin' doggz
Outlaw with stripes, Niggas run for they gun
When I stomp the night
I'm obsessed by the Tec's
Have money and sex
Old respect, check my rep
Cuz I'm one of the best
Wanna label me a threat
Cuz I invade they game, tip Tha Pound, made the game
Now they praise my name
And it's where it's on, ain't no rules for hoods
Gotta tussle in the struggle
So remove the strips [Yeah yeah]
Mind as blank, from the drink and the deck I'm on
Knockin' ho's from the way I gte my gangsta on
East Long Beach, 2-1 Street, we keep it crackin'
Hell Ya, Soopafly, Now that's what's happenin'

Chorus:
[Soopafly]
If ya down with Tray-Deee say Hell Ya [ Hell Ya]
If ya down with makin' G'z say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
If you ride for your block say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
Bringin' shit that don't stop say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
If you like to get high say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
If you like to get rich say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
If you like to fuck a bitch say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]

C'mon say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
Say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
Check it say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
Muthafucka say Hell Ya [Hell Ya]
