[Intro: Kurupt + Daz]
We bringing to life Dogg Pound Gangstas
Me and Dat Nigga Daz—what’s up, Daz?
What’s up, Kurupt, man?
We back doin’ it up again, man, you know’m’sayin’?
Big Snoop Dogg ride the train
Soopafly, Nate Dogg, let’s ride, homie

[Chorus: Kurupt]
Life without the Pound is turned upside down
Had to take a look around and take two steps out
My body just to take a look at what I’m in now
What I been through, what I been around

[Verse 1: Daz Dillinger + Kurupt]
We unfadeable, back up on a mission where we left off
Taking more losses, you’ll be lying in the coffin
Flossin’ the heaters, shiny two-seater
You know me and my homie stay G’d up, from the feet up
Me and my nigga Daz, the Glock and the mask
Cock it and blast, cock and popped in the stash, look

[Bridge: Soopafly]
Now we on this brand new 2006 shit
The movement: Dogg Pound Gangsta reunion
Daz, Kurupt; Kurupt and Daz
Back on the block, from corners to aves
Stay ready to smash

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger + Kurupt]
The Doggs are B-A-C-C, strapped, leave ya shell-shocked
From handheld Glock—who else could get popped?
Lay ya flat, vicious when I attack—brraatt!
From my 9 millimeter rat-a-tat-tat
Never serious, and I’m seriously ridin’
Chippin’ is gonna take a fat pushin’ and slidin’
That boy sharp, floatin’ like an arc in the wind
Dillinger and Young Gotti in this bitch again

[Bridge: Soopafly + Kurupt]
Gangstas, G’s, yeah, we thugs on the rise
Dogg Pound Gangstas ‘til the day that we die
We make it happen, keep it crackin’, money stackin’
Make a pact and just ridin’ through the streets on D’s, the DP’s
Gangstas, G’s, yeah, we thugs on the rise
Dogg Pound Gangstas ‘til the day that we die
We make it happen, keep it crackin’, money stackin’
Make a pact and just ridin’ through the streets on D’s, the DP’s

[Verse 3: Daz Dillinger]
I keep it crackin’, keep it jumpin’, never slippin’ ‘cause I’m dumpin’
If you funny-acting, nigga, yeah, we might get up to somethin’
Get beat down, rolled up, stomped out with Chuck
Dogg Pound, homie, all up in the cut
A terror, the mayhem is tragedy, cuh
Blue mask, blue gloves, I’m a G-G-G-G thug, nigga

[Bridge: Soopafly]
Take a ride on this West Coast gangbang expedition
Worldwide on a gangsta mission
Daz, Kurupt; Kurupt and Daz, back on that ass
First that buck, first to get smashed

[Verse 4: Kurupt]
I got an ounce of some bomb, rollin’ through Vietnam
Got some hash in the stash, orange and chocolate Thai
That 2005 orange and chocolate Thai
That shit that put elephants to sleep on the side
I got a Caprice, me and Soopafly Priest
D-A-Z, Big Snoop, Nate, Rage, and Warren G
Taking trips to Thailand, all sorts of islands
Doing movies, bitches in jacuzzis
All hood

[Outro: Kurupt + Daz]
Dogg Pound Gangstas
Yeah, we in the muthafuckin’ house right about now
Daz and Kurupt, Dogg Pound Gangstas
Put your muthafuckin’ hands in the air
Swerve from left to right, right to left
Is y’all muthafuckas ready?
Let’s get busy in this muthafucka
Dogg Pound (Dogg Pound)
Dogg Pound (Dogg Pound Gangstaz)
Dogg Pound (Dogg Pound)
Dogg Pound (Dogg Pound Gangstas)
