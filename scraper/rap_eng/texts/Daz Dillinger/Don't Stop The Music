[Verse 1: Daz Dillinger]
Yo, my music is a form of expression when I’m writin’, the melody’s the rhythm that Diggy Daz be providen’
The definition of music according to the culture, social contacts and I’m the [?]
When I die, my music will live on forever, this the gift that I give you the treasure’
The quality of the sound is important when I’m grooving, the speaker kicking out the bass nigga when it’s boomin’
Stereo, mono, in the club [?], it’s about the music nigga everywhere that I go
If it wasn’t for the [?] and the claps, these dope raps I’ll never think to do like that
Turn the power up, cause we can hear you full blast, if ya love the music, and if ya fuckin’ with Daz, pump up the volume nigga, bang bangin’ on ten, it’s when I’m in the mall nigga when it all begins, so

[Hook: Daz Dillinger and Yabrough & Peoples]
Don’t keep stoppin’ don’t keep stoppin’ stop the music. (x2)

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
Hey, the DJ played it back to back, I love the way he mixes, I love the way that he scratch
Got the party with their hands up and this shit getting loud, this is how we survive, from the lows and the high
Look at baby on the dance floor so energetic, the music is a drug and I’m about to inject it
The harmony, the soundwaves only you can feel it through your soul your feet, yeah, that be the realist
Just because it’s 2 O’clock, don’t mean that we have to stop, just when its 5am I'm a freak up and fuck your friend
Because she dance like she fuckin’ like she wanna have a baby, the music captivated got her mind going crazy, that’s where the party’s at, tell the DJ to bring it back, like that

[Hook: Daz Dillinger and Yabrough & Peoples]
Don’t keep stoppin’, don’t keep stoppin’, stop the music.(x2)

I just wanna rock you all night long (x2)
I can tell, you wanna boogie (just walk to this)
I can tell, you wanna boogie (just walk to this)
I can tell, you wanna boogie (homie C walk to this)
I can tell, you wanna boogie (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Daz Dillinger]
I can tell she wanna get it back in, look at her tolerance
Burnin’ up the dance floor you the hottest bitch. The way that you move you turn me on, I wanna ride that pussy til the brake of dawn
She play me in her iPad and iPod constantly, she a D.A.Z fan obviously
Check out my catalogue, pick what you want, givin’ you that G shit just to rattle ya trunk
Or put me in your headphones and play it (BOOM) got that IDK music nigga just for you
The DJ makes the mother fuckin’ party, keep us boogieing, freak somebody
Without the music the world would be fucked, with bass and treble, coming out the cut
I’m Daz, so step up on they ass, give you mother fuckers a  blast from the past

[Hook: Daz Dillinger and Yabrough & Peoples]
Don’t  keep stoppin’, don’t keep stoppin’, stop the music.(x3)

{Verse 4: Daz Dillinger]
Yeah, that nigga Daz, I ain't gone never stop nigga, I'm a keep going nigga, til the end of time nigga, my music last for ever nigga, timeless bitch
Let me let you know a little something like this, what time is it

[Hook: Daz Dillinger and Yabrough & Peoples]
Just because it’s 2 O’clock, don’t mean that we have to stop (x5)
