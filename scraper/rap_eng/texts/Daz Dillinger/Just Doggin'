[Kurupt]
It's just another day in the hood for Kurupt, yeah, that's me
Got scooped by Snoop in a black Cherokee
Daz in the back, Warren G. in the front
Nice sack of chronic with some gin in a cup
Back up, I stack up ends
Tha Pound and The Row is my only friends
If you talk shit, I hit you hard as I can
You talk shit once but never again

[Daz]
Well, I'm back with the bubonic chronic sack for that ass
So all my doggs back to back blaze the zags
To the fuller feeling, a feeling you never could feel
Where your mind is calm, and your body is chill
As I mob with Tha Pound and my nigga Nate Dogg
Not flaggin', but saggin', we're havin' a ball
Yes, all y'all motherfuckers wanna cee like doggs
Wanna be like doggs, but can't compare to doggs

[Kurupt]
It's like one to the two, two to the three
K to the U-R-U-P-T
In effect, I steps with a Tec in the back
Ain't no hood got no love, so I packs a strap, and...

[Nate Dogg]
I once knew a nigga named Dr. Dre
He was a baller from the muthafuckin' CPT (A baller from the CPT)
He hooked up with some niggas from the LBC
And now they fuckin' up the whole rap industry

[Daz]
Well, uh, check it out, and peep game on the one
They call Dat Nigga Daz, an OG from Tha Pound
Straight puttin' it down for the Eastside (Right)
But this is just a dub sack of dope sold to your ass to get smoked
Now, you can't see my muthafuckin' homie from the CPT
And you can't see my muthafuckin' doggs from the LBC

[Kurupt]
Check this flow, boo-boo ain't the word to describe me (Nigga)
Remember, I murder niggas as a hobby
Bodies get battered for fuckin with the best
Y'all jump with the Tec and tear his whole fuckin' chest off
Do I give a fuck? (Hell naw) I'm a loc nigga
(Who you tryin' to provoke, nigga?) Step and get smoked, nigga
Strap in the back, I'm rollin' and I'm bumpin'
Niggas talk shit, I roll by and start dumpin'
Uh, who play the role like the G's?
Punk ass little fuckin' mark niggas, please
Murder in the first degree
I step with a Tec, burst and flee
You'll find none worst than me
See, motherfuckers murdered and mangled, strangled
On bitches like a bangle
Take it from a whole different angle
Bitches, I'm never simpin', you'll see me pimpin', I slip the clip in
Bust a cap, watch them fall flat on they back
Like this and like that from an automatic strap
So, retire the Tec, nuff respect
I gets wreck with a Glock and it just don't stop
I check every nigga known that's tryin' to check me
I wreck microphone, verbally respect me
I'm off to the store to get me a 4-O, so I'm headed out the door

[Daz]
Now as I roll with Kurupt and my cousin Eastwood
On a mission up to no good
We don't love you bitch
After we finish diggin'
Tha Pound's about that dollar and takin' no shit
From no busta ass niggas, really doe, shit
Trick, recognize game when it slaps your face
Shit, you see it ain't no thizzang to take you to the next stizzage
One-time can't trizzace, now buy a pump 12-gauge
You've been sleeping on the Daz for a long time
Waitin' for the nigga to come bust a dope rhyme
So, uh, motherfuckers throw your hands in the air
And get your proper groove on like you don't care

[Kurupt + Daz]
But see, I don't love them hoes, I look above them hoes
Keep my mind on my money, that's just how my money flows
And so...
Hoe, I thought you knew, so now you know, biatch

Dogg Pound's in the house, you're good to go, Just Doggin'
