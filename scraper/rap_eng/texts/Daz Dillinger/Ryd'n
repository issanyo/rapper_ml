Yeah, mob through the city, paint looking like candy
Headed to my bad bitch, that pussy come in handy
Throw that bitch some dick, got that bitch running from me
Head back to the trap, lick some shit that really slap
All we do is smoke strong, neighbors know what’s going on
Can’t stay in one spot, too long, cause other shit be going on
Flip this how it is, in my hood, ride with a G
This how it is in my hood, ride with a breeze
Ridin, ridin, ridin, wheels spinning on the traffic while I’m banging my beat
I be ridin, ridin, ridin, nigga all through the hood with a bag and I push far away
Take night, I be ridin, ridin, ridin
Hating but I’m doing what you wishing you can be like me
Niggas see me just all through the hood, all through the hood
All through the hood, all through the hood
Nigga I’m all in the hood, that nigga ball in the hood
When it’s a problem in the streets nigga you know it ain’t good
Hit a nigga with some games, still stay in my lane
Hit a nigga with that thing, that’s just part how we bang
24 still shinning, just got it washed and waxed
Daz on the macs, 93 airmax
Bitches love it when a niggao n that big boy status
Just tryina beat that pussy up on that big boy mattress
The city wildest … east side, lb
When its time to get money y’all niggas call me
I want my hands in everything, yeah I get greedy
I’m back on that mind state, the streets yelling feed me
Eat your ass alive if you really can’t survive
Shit can get live, have you on the news at 5
A report from a reporter saying another nigga died
Hard through the city in the hood as a bomb
Ridin, ridin, ridin, wheels spinning on the traffic while I’m banging my beat
I be ridin, ridin, ridin, nigga all through the hood with a bag and I push far away
Take night, I be ridin, ridin, ridin
Hating but I’m doing what you wishing you can be like me
Niggas see me just all through the hood, all through the hood
All through the hood, all through the hood
Stay in the hood, cause I was raised in the hood
Don’t say you looking for a nigga, yeah I’m right up in the hood
Ain’t never hard to find me, I’m on 21 in logan
Smokin on that potion, yeah I’m spitting the dopest
Switch lane, my engine is so clean
You might have ask, my shit is so mean
I swear to god you think you just flew down
It’s when I hope on that motherfucker, I’m feeling jet lag
A couple niggas riding hood want that charlie sheen
I get it all up quick, they buy the whole thing
Look, survival is the main thing, and them dulo niggas want wide hood gang bang
Done heard it all, done seen it all
Done seen a nigga hit the top and make that fast fall
See I’m just showing you that hood life
And what my hood really like when I’m
Ridin, ridin, ridin, wheels spinning on the traffic while I’m banging my beat
I be ridin, ridin, ridin, nigga all through the hood with a bag and I push far away
Take night, I be ridin, ridin, ridin
Hating but I’m doing what you wishing you can be like me
Niggas see me just all through the hood, all through the hood
All through the hood, all through the hood
