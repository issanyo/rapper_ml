[Verse 1 - Game]
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party when I'm spittin' to Pac
The paint fall off your Miss King when I'm spittin' the Glock
Before I was sixteen I was liftin' a drop
Spittin' on cops, pitchin' the rock
Like Charlie Ward before the New York Knicks
Now you can catch me in Brooklyn with Fab on a New York bitch
While you old niggas in rehab
And if I can't be a hip hop legend I'll just die in a ski mask

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
When a gangsta like me ride it be suede in it, be shade tinted
Tires got the rims that Spree made in it
One of the prettiest hoes be laid in it
Blowin' the kid faster than prepaid minutes
I'm guessin' these haters don't know I keep the Wes in the ators
Fully loaded with the vest penetrators
But if they want it, y'all can get it
You love the way the coaster coast chiefs did it
