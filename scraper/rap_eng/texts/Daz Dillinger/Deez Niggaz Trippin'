[Daz Dillinger]
Who say they want some? Kill 'em up just for fun
Columbian neck tie, we string 'em up from the tongue
No speakin' when grown folks is talkin'..
And that's when that chrome start barkin'
Heavenly Father prepare me for the slaughter
Which they do not know to leave 'em stiff in the coffin
Often times I never leave home without it
Back up nigga cause my space gettin' crowded (move!)
Give me some elbow room
Dana Dane, chrome shoes, as my beat go boom
('86 Cadillac rock the bitches shoes)
You shouted and pouted but your point still wasn't really shit
You'll get beat down when you jump up quick, punk bitch
Dat Nigga Daz is on your ass, causin' confusion at last
I'm out for the cash flow
Grab a hold of yourself, I spit rhymes
Click nines, and I sho' 'nuff rip spines
Leave my imagination up on your mind
Causin' destruction every time

[Chorus: Soopafly] - X 2
Don't fuck with me, I got shit on my mind
Deez niggas trippin', so I let off my nine
And I bust a whole round, better get on the ground
Deez niggas trippin', *POW! POW!* - the sound

[Daz Dillinger]
Wake up another day, make it drop
To broke niggas and crooked cops
How many chickens do it take to get full?
With no strings attached me and my peeps got pulled
I stay laced, turn up the bass some more if I could
Watchin' them diamonds grip the wood
I aughts to go roll up a Optimo
I knock at your door, nigga just get on the floor (get down!)
I duct tape you and your hoe
You know what I came here for - all your coke or yayo
I'll sail the seven seas, be lovin' every ki
You ready for me?  My pen locations got every team
Especially when it's formatted, rocked up, or flatted
You now I got the bomb for these addicts, it's so tragic
I'll sack it on a triple beam if a blue beam
Erasin' niggas just off your team
We chasin' the green, might need ice, indeed
Releasin' pressure, catchin' niggas, releasin' off steam
Can't nobody compare, who dares to fight fair
Puttin' niggas in Intensive Care
Plus the knowledge we share is fatal
Cause once I tell you, I gots to kill you
Unable to rebuild you, my face is unfamiliar
Deadly as crystal crack, how should I react
With intentions to keep on mashin', strap for strap

[Chorus: Soopafly] - X 2
Don't fuck with me, I got shit on my mind
Deez niggas trippin', so I let off my nine
And I bust a whole round, better get on the ground
Deez niggas trippin', *POW! POW!* - the sound

[Daz Dillinger]
Do up G's, will make me clutch it indeed
Shootin' wicked than Kobe Bryant on the line for 3 (swish!)
It ain't the same no more
We pack steel and ammo, and niggas gettin' blammo
It's nature... notice my behavior
It's gettin' tense, when I'm toe down and bent
I get to thinkin' "how the fuck can I get rich?"
I dig into my pocket, all my money's spent
And so I grab my strap and leave my residence
And how can I make some dead presidents?
I made a trade in the kitchen
Mixed some vitamins with my chickens
They never knew it, they can never tell the difference
I double up and flip 'em
I got the bomb shit for the streets
It's that motherfuckin' nigga D-A-Z
D.P.G. for L-I-F-E
Keepin' it gangsta 'til I D-I-E


[Chorus: Soopafly] - X 2
Don't fuck with me, I got shit on my mind
Deez niggas trippin', so I let off my nine
And I bust a whole round, better get on the ground
Deez niggas trippin', *POW! POW!* - the sound

*POW!* - the sound
*POW!* - the sound
