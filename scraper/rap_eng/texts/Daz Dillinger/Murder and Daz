[Intro: C-Murder (Daz Dillinger)]
(Yeah, what's happenin?)
Whassup Daz nigga?
(Whassup C-Murder?)
Shit, I think we got problems
(What?)
Ya know?
(Fuck that.)
Nigga call back Sean let's do that shit like this
(How we doin it just like this.)
Okay
(Ya know what I'm sayin?)
Let's ride on em
(Buck all yall.)
Ya heard?

[Daz Dillinger]
Aww yeah (aww yeah), it's bout that time to get into some gangsta shit
A second no doubt nigga before we bang you quick
The gang and No Limit, we about to trip
Slangin these thangs as a youngster
Grew up with killers and drug niggas, big cowards and busters
Seen it all from a mile away, but it's all on straight
With automatic with static nigga cause we don't play
C-Murder rap up and pat up and rap up, out to get him nigga what up
With enough lead to make these niggas shut the fuck up
Boom boom as me and my niggas come through with attitude
Actin rude, slappin and jackin these fools
Rollin down the block as the system knock
Truck beatin deep as a motherfucker, fuck the cops
I bust on niggas with nerve, pull up on niggas on the curb
Swerve and yell out nigga you ain't heard
Bout as dollar birds, loaded high of herb
Sean duck, what the fuck, niggas are rollin it up
My heart is cold as ice, day and night
Strapped with shit you can't fuck with, so you better get white
See gotta gun it off, got up and stumbled, fell and fall
??? and spin niggas with my motherfuckin doggs
Cause when you fuck with us you done fucked with the real
So we don't fuck with sucka niggas, busta niggas that squeal

[Hook: Daz Dillinger]
Yellin hey (hey), yo (yo), hey (hey), yo (yo)
Why niggas wanna try to fuck with this man
You knowin how we do, how we do man
Yellin hey (hey), yo (yo), hey (hey), yo (yo)
Why niggas wanna try to fuck with this man
You knowin how we do it, we don't play play

[C-Murder]
In God I trust, for them gats I bust
And fuck the world cause a gangsta bitch, I never trust
Now who's to blame for the motherfucking rain pouring down on my head
I guess it was the life I led
Cause society done made me into a villan
And I'm willing to execute another killing
Cause I dwell with them cut throats and alcoholics
And been a member ever since I could remember
Relieve stress with the sex and masturbation
And ride for No Limit with no motherfucking hesitation
Cause I'm a TRU nigga (TRU nigga), a real nigga (real nigga)
A go getta (a go getta), and wig splitter
With my nigga daz, quick to blast and whoop your ass
And fuck a mask, leavin niggas up in a body bag
And L.T., lace the weed and run the motherfucking beat
Cause Murder and Daz run the motherfucking streets

[Hook]

[Outro: Woman]
Daz, they took all my money, they took my jewelry
They took everything
I don't know what I'm a do
I'm broke

[C-Murder]
Ya know what Daz, send that hoe over here
Come here bitch
Come here, come here, come here!
Don't touch my motherfucking money
Hoe don't ever come on this motherfucking spot
