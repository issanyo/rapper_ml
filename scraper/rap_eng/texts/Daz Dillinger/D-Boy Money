Cali love, Daz Dillinger
I’m wild on the beat, boy, come and get you
Some green in my lungs, we go heavy on the kush
VIP, waiters non-stop with the killer’s shot
Real wounded, long skirts, tight pants, what a view
Tired of my old bitch, might just get me something new
One night with a pimp, no strings
Bitch of my dreams and a big cabaline

And she all in my pocket trying to see if I’m rich

If nigga got a problem, chop ‘em, busting on their ass
Got mind on my money, money on my mind
