[Intro]
All the Jim boes in the house, I love you and all my people is here
I'm doing a damn thing I'mma say bow wow wow yupy yo yupy yey
Who let all the damn turkeys out

[Hook]
There's no way I can express the way that I feel
All I notice that it's all that is for real
All I wanna say inside of you is the truth
Just to let you know forever we'll miss you
Down never forgot  we miss you
Down never forgot we miss you

[Verse 1]
My uncle Jimbo Ring Vanity Junior
Ever since I was a kid I always knew
My momma's oldest brother now you in
Heaven with your father and yo mother
Miss mainly sayn tuny tuny come with me
Then you walk into heavenly gates heaven is the city
I enjoy the bad and good times I share with ya
Never had it but all this is on just like my sister's
I love y'all yeah you know Diggy said it
Look through the garden of heaven with my aunt Deborah
I miss my uncle so much, I neva forget sneaking in yo house
Scared waking you up all the way up to
Dancing across the stage and everything that you say
Act like look like memories moments friends smiles flashbacks
Clear since I was a child uncle Jumbo

[Hook]
There's no way I can express the way that I feel
All I notice that it's all that is for real
All I wanna say inside of you is the truth
Just to let you know forever we'll miss you
Down never forgot we miss you
Down never forgot we miss you

[Verse 2]
Hmm, my eldest uncle OG like Tookie
Wake up in the night like hi my little Pokie
Nah nah-nah nah my lil tutu
Make yo people smile and laugh is what you used to
Dancing across the stage with Daz and Kurupt Joe Cool
Superfly and the homegirl Rage now turn the page
You gone and now I'm missing you
Banging on persons a lot lo' in the dressing rooms
Boomed and groomed dipped in whip
One thing about my uncle Jumbo, he talk plenty shit
Hennessey oh e a pack of Winchester
Every line, every sentence you really made a difference
Mississippi to L.A. working the soft gate
Family landscape remember miss Johnson
That mom with sugar free I miss you like a mathafucker
Joe Bob rest in peace

[Hook]
There's no way I can express the way that I feel
All I notice that it's all that is for real
All I wanna say inside of you is the truth
Just to let you know forever we'll miss you
