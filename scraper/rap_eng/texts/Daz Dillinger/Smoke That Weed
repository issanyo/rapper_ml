[Daz Dillinger]
Right about now
It's time to get into my zone (what zone is that)
Dillinger and friends, we got a big smokeout jumpin out
We got pounds upon pounds

[singers - in background]
Smoke that, smoke that, smoke that
Smoke that, weeeeed
You know we smoke that, smoke that, smoke that
You know we smoke that, weeeeed

[repeat in background]
I say we smoke that, smoke that
I say we smoke that weeeeed
I say we smoke that, smoke that
I say we smoke that weeeeed

Hustlin, grindin, it's a natural cause for me y'knahmsayin
I breathe it, I live it, that's what I do y'knahmsayin
All the way out here in Seattle

Dillinger and friends, smokin up, all the motherfuckin Swishers

Goin to get the big brack, the big box, of Swishers
Y'all know what it is mayne!
I'm chillin I'm smokin, that's what we do
It's goin around like a choo choo train
It's movin and doin the same thang
448 grams, you count it up, a pound
Smoke it on down, y'know
27 grams, but you can put it over like 28 29
It wouldn't matter
