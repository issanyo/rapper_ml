Yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, gangsta shit
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, gangsta shit
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah, *BOOM* wit dat gangsta shit

Yeah yeah yeah, what what, I take a slice to tha gut
I cut thru at least two coats
Spit you like Harold Nevitt from the Blue Notes
Smokin' on my blunts and my Newports
??? you ain't ready
Now if I am the Princeton at the mall drop slow
Watch yo' ass
DPG set to mash
Mission crush I'm first opponents'll stay plush
Get rushed quick when I inject illegal substance
What's this, off brand nigga you get chopped up
Tossed and turned, nigga burn you learn
That these suckers is get'n wound up like ultra perm
Spine crack thru yo back now that's yo concern
Wit that 9 in my pocket and at least a Grand
You can't break territory, you can't stop the man
And order cup, beware the bite last shark it's the
Chef cookin' up yo death match pipe this up
Heavyweighted, keep baited, so you bite this up
Sockin nigga til he did it right tight this much game
Exchange leave em all ashamed
Who can stop the pain
Who can stop the reign
Fuck a mundane, you look around it's Da Pound
What ya found hundred of bodies all over the ground
From the touch, I squeezed it bring it into a clutch
Yo mouth shut, slap thru a tension
I peacepipe this for intervention
No class, you get suspicion
C-clap, tightin' that tension and not to mention
I'm a Dogg Pound gangsta
Check it out, I'm a Dogg Pound gangsta
Now all my niggas sayin
