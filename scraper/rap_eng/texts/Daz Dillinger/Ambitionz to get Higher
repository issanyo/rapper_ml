WaddupTho

(Hook)
I can't deny it imma get Higher
You don't wanna smoke wit me
Got 50 Blunts in the Backseat
Like the Strain Imma straight OG

(Verse)
My Ambitonz to get Higher
Higher than the Mayans
Don't fuck wit the Sons
Cause Teller Lit ya squad up
These little motherfuckers all they do is make me tired
Tired of my culture that they Killin in the process
What happened to the barz man why these niggas Singin
Think it's funny like its Kenen blastin all these teks I'm bringin
And I'm fiendin for the millions that they said they gon bring
But fake niggas in my circle say they love me then they leave me
Better Duck nigga don't give a fuck nigga
Thug Life on my Stomach so wassup nigga
Fuck the Cops that keep on Killin on us nigga
Fuck the rules that you try to put on us nigga
So wassup nigga ready to pull triggers
I'm out like I'm ghost in a suit nigga
Respect your fuckin jaw like my name mista
Lost Son till the end for you fuck niggas

RIP to my nigga tho Happy Birthday to my nigga tho
