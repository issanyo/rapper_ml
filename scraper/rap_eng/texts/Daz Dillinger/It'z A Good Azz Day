[Daz Dillinger]
Whip out the Chevy, ride up Crenshaw on a Sunday afternoon
We '6-4 bounce and live it up and let's cruise
My music bumpin', let the top down
Let the world see who it is, Daz and Kurupt (from Tha Pound)
We C-Walkin', G talkin', everybody everywhere
Good to see ya here homie, good to see ya there
The price of livin's fair, pour out some liquor
And this is how we do it, just me and my nigga
You know my steez, I do it at ease
Bitches nibble on my dick like a rat does cheese
Swift out when I come through bouncin'
Drinkin' Olde English straight out the fountain
Ain't no mountain I can't climb
It's just my flow and my rhyme, time will prevail nigga with time
I keep it energized, power on up
I'm cuttin' it up to mix it down, nigga we fuckin' it up

[Chorus] - X 2
It's a good ass day
I'm playin' with '6-4s and '6-treys
Yeah it's on and crackin' baby
Gotta keep it rockin' the hood way
Yeah, it's a good ass day

[Kurupt]
Just a little bit of heaven in ya, bangin' Devin
Rollin' down the streets like...
Smokin' that weed, feelin' fine
Got me a 40 and fat ass dime
Back in the days it was like Vietnam
Nowadays it seems like everybody's bitter
Make a nigga turn into Gotti Adolf Hitler
What you about, you can tell your boy
I'm the real McCoy, I ride like alloy
Look nigga, it's just a California thang
It's the way we are, it's just the way we bang
Ever since Snoop dropped "G Thang"
The party's been poppin' in the G wing
This is how it cracks in the G college
Where all that ya learn is the G knowledge
That motherfuckin' D.P.G.C. knowledge

[Chorus] - X 2
It's a good ass day
I'm playin' with '6-4s and '6-treys
Yeah it's on and crackin' baby
Gotta keep it rockin' the hood way
Yeah, it's a good ass day

[Daz Dillinger]
West Coast, West Coast, yeah I said the West Coast
Who got that gangsta shit and who got the best smoke
Yes so for sure, how to really explain it, it's simple
I'll crush the nickle, have ya suckin' a pickle
All I need is one gun, it'll do the job fine
I'll watch yo' back and you watch mine
Bring them toys out, we hoppin' all over the world
This for my homeboys and all my homegirls

[Kurupt]
Ya know, this is just temporary
I can't help to think about Morgan and Mary
McKenzie, Trent and Cam
All I'ma do is just ride and ram
Expand past islands, Japan
And just come up with my own island and land
Been past the moon, Mars ain't far
I've been around the greatest entertainers and stars
A youth uncouped without a shred of proof, low-key

[Chorus] - X 2
It's a good ass day
I'm playin' with '6-4s and '6-treys
Yeah it's on and crackin' baby
Gotta keep it rockin' the hood way
Yeah, it's a good ass day
