[Daz Dillinger]
What the fuck y'all police stoppin me fo
Cuz I'm black and I'm young
Nigga pushin crack and packin a gun
The mothafuckin police want to swap me constantly
25 to life is what the judge wanna offer me
And put me down and beat me down on the street
With that badge you ain't shit fuck a C-O-P
Uh
Young nigga got it bad cuz I'm brown
Wanna complain about my loud ass sounds
Wanna give me a ticket
But you know what you can stick it
You crooked, you bitch ass, you punk ass biggot
Fuck the police
That's what a nigga yellin out
When I'm up in them cells when I'm chilled out
Fuck justice
Fuck peace
Everywhere I go all my niggas yellin out

[Chorus - 4x]
Fuck the police
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Fuck the police

Fuck the police!
