[Kurupt]
Beitch, it's the Gangstaz!

Where dem bitchez at? where da homiez at?

[Verse I - Daz]
Cruzin' down the block
And my system bangin' out about a million watts
All these suckers wanna stare and jock
And hear my shit subbin' down the block
I'ma tell you what I got and my shit be thumpin'
5 10s in the back we bumpin'
Chrome deez on an ice machine and god damn my shit be thumpin'
Boom boom thats just my amps
E-q'z with the alpine deck
Y'all niggas can't really fuck wit this
All my homeboys know who got the shit
See the girls like bass when it's in they face
And when they love it cut it feels so great
When I pull up homegirl I got the gate
All my homeboys luv that bass

[Kurupt]
All I want is my gold deez
Talkin on my phones and a Armani's
OG DP GC's kurupt and D-A-Z
64 dippin' down the streets
Switches or not as long as-it got beats
All my homeboyz on the cut like we dont give a fuck
What the fuck? what bounce my homeboys rounded
DPG surrounded you know how gangstaz roll
G'ing in full control hittin' up in mo' control
Dipping on all gold
Why the fuck you wanna play wit a gangta man

Chorus - Daz (Kurupt)
My system bumpin' down the street

[Verse II - Daz]

Wit the fresh ass D'zwit the killer weed
And my shit lookin' hell'a clean
You can hear me around the corner music bangin'
Because I like it loud
Wanna buy dippin' high wit the homeboyz
Me and my niggas be shakin' the crowd
50 amps and 30 woofers and my shit be pushing power
Cruzing not givin' a fuck rollin' about 3 miles an hour
Im the shit at the car shows
I'll be flossin wit all the hoes
Old school cadillac cutless then 64's

[Verse III - The Mactress]
See me and my girls will buy a lexus jeep
Rollin 6 deep till you hear the beat
Bumpin' loud move twice lets move the crowd
Gettin' rowdy rowdy wit my bumpin sounds
No doubt get a price and my system tight
Y'all niggas ain't the only one wit Karl Kani
Got bumpin' beats stepped of on your chest
Showing all y'all niggas that I bump the best
See we be wilding pro-filing sipping crystal

So all you fellas don't doubt it
