[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now we was once two brutha’s of the same kind
Quick to approach a ghetto cutie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still roll
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a jheri curl never quite learn
Drinking 90 proof on the roof trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the till, sayin' how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope games
I just got the phone call, heard you got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque, No time for females
I’m losing touch with my homie he’s a changed man
He hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I say I’m living large, all you see is the struggle
When I say I’m still thugging, all you see is the trouble
Congratulation on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and everybody miss ya
I know we grew apart, you probably don’t remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never did get with her
And I can see us after school, we’d BOMB
On the first playa hatas with the wrong set on
Now the whole things changed, ‘cause we don’t even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain’t even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same young brutha that
When it’s time for war go toe to toe we’ll watch a brutha’s back
I can’t even lie, 'cause I ain't laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, but go ahead
'Cause I ain’t mad at cha
(Hmm, I ain’t mad at cha))

[Hook: Danny Boy]
I ain't, mad, at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't, mad, at cha

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin', that we wasn’t
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I’m gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' 'n' grindin' wasn’t nothin' on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind me back, to a place was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we seperated, you told me you’d wait
Don’t give nobody my lovin' while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I’ll return but I gotta fight the fate’s arrived
Don’t shed a tear, 'cause Mama I ain’t happy here
I’m through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin' max, I’m knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', “Hell, I know one day I’ll be back”
But as soon as I touch down
I told my girl I’ll be there, so prepare, to get loved down
My homies wanna kick it, but I’m just laughin' at cha
Y'all play too many games, but I ain’t mad at cha

[Hook: Danny Boy]
I ain't, mad, at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't, mad, at cha

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Father forgive us for livin' while all my homies stuck in prison
Barely breathin' believin' that the world is a prism
It's like a ghetto we can never leave
A broken rose givin' bloom through the cracks of the concrete
So many other things for us to see
Things to be, our history so full of tragedy and misery
To all my homies never made it home
The dead peers I shed tattooed tears for, when I'm alone
Picture us inside a ghetto heaven, a place to rest
Findin' peace through this land of stress
In my chest I feel pain come in sudden storms
Life full of rain in this game watch for lead thorns
Our unborn never got to grow, never got to see what's next
In this world full of countless threats
I beg God, to make a way for our ghetto kids to breathe
Show us sign, make us all believe
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

[Hook: Danny Boy]
I ain't, mad, at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't, mad, at cha
I ain't, mad, at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't, mad, at cha
