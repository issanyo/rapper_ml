[Intro: Daz Dillinger)
I get rap money
Another day another dollar (Another day another dollar)
I get rap money (Rap money)
Another day another dollar
I get rap money

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Take a dance with the devil if you will
Hit the booth to lay my vocals with a seven of some kill
Still addicted to the reefer, been a chiefer since a teen though
Started serving sacks of stress, weed through my screen door
Went to banging them boulders through my burglar bars
Knowing every fiend that I serve, I could get served with a charge
People set me up, tried to rob me in my cousin garage
Even your family will fuck you, fuck love, its just a facade
I need some rap money, pimping my pen, getting paid, bitch
Paper in my pocket before I jump on the stage, bitch
Let them labels know that a piece of change ain't gonna change him
Cuz' way before I gave you this Gary thing I was slanging, banging
Eastside niggas gotta eat
Got caught up on 65, it's been dry for about a week
Pray to the heavenly father, now I lay me down to sleep
I promise I'ma take my hands up out the streets if I could only get some rap money

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
Ya rather do this shit than that shit
Don't get it fucked up that's just some rap shit
Ya rather do this than that shit
Don't get it fucked up that's just some rap shit

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
Started smoking Chronic out with Doctor Dre
Youngest out the group, wishing and hoping to get paid
Starving on two bags of weed with seven niggas
Created Doggystyle, the youngest up out to live the Dogg Pound
Still hungry, poured us some dog food, alleged
Don't try to tell me dreams don't come true
Formatted the plan, the motherfucking man
Rap money in my hand, mo' G's and mo' gram
Hooked up with Pac, all eyes on me
Just call me that nigga Daz or the D-A-Z
Twenty years later I'm here just like I never left
Rock the motherfucking stage, every night I collect
Worldwide respect, keep it independent
Distribute and press my own CDs, ya little nigga
Sixty days later this how a nigga spend it
Rap money, hundred thousand sold, nigga meal ticket
Love rap money

[Hook]
