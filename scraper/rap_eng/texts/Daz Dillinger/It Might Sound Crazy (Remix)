[Intro: Daz]
You in love? Haha, check it out, baby
I'm about having my buisness, clocking my dollars and moving on
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, it's the remix baby
Haha, Too Short, Daz Dillinger and Battlecat
Making it happen like that, you know what I'm saying, baby?

[Verse 1: Daz Dillinger]
Woke up one bright morning, took a glimpse at the clock
Feelin' like the man as I shake the spot
Freaked the girl named Tamika, made my bass thump deeper
My girl huntin' me down, paged me all up on my beeper
As I continued to adjust the amps and bust the speaker
My girl paged again, and again, and again
As I'm chilling with her mother's best friend
Askin' 'bout my kids, say they gettin' big
As we moan and dig
Fucked another - she was kinda thick but kinda slim
Freaky little thang named Kim
Askin' when we gon' engage in bomb sex again
I'm askin' her "when you gon' get buckwild again?"
I mean she took me to her house
Worked Daz straight, turned me out
Wanna know the freaky thangs that you talk about
I really wanna make it rough, make it soft, no doubt
If you wanna get it on, we can turn it out
You in love

[Chorus]
I said it might sound crazy but she's in love
I said it might sound crazy but she's in love

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
Told Miss Harris it was too late to stop and too late to quit
I was lovin' that {pussy} while she was lovin' this {dick}
I was all up in her while she was yellin' don't quit
I was beating the meat down, while we was deep in the [?]
She said - "Let's have a freaky, freaky, freaky type experience
That's very diff-er-ent, that's so magnificent"
She had a bad bad friend named Spearmint
Thought she was the gum the way the baby hummed
Let's get freaky tonight, let's get it on
Let's get live tonight, ya know
Baby gave a show, true indeed, the way she did her thang
I knew she was a pro, I knew she was a pro
I had a young tender that I'll always remember
Named Dana, needed something just to tame her
Every two months, I'd telephone her ringer when she all alone
To come over at night when her man ain't home

[Chorus]
I said it might sound crazy but she's in love
I said it might sound crazy but she's in love

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
I can't trust you baby, I need a woman like Tracy
Got a good job, when she walks in the place, she -
Gets respect with them big-ass hips
She ain't no first date gobble, with some big ass lips
I'm picking winners, never get the wrong ones
Check me right now, I got a pocket full of phone numbers
She said "You wanna be a player all yo' life?
You'll never get a woman you can call your wife"
You see, Tracy got it going on, see her tryna get wit' me
Her sister got my beeper number, keeps on hittin' me
Think we did it twice long time ago
But now I like Tracy and she won't let go
I know some of these suckas might think it's scary
Will it come back on him if he gets married
I never would dwell on what I did in the past
'Cause if I put it down, I'mma make it last
And get the cash, why you always talking that love stuff
No, it ain't happ'nin', yo know what's up
Actin' like Michelle when I told her I missed her
She said I love you right after I kissed her
That's an everyday scenario - now here you go
Tryna be good to me, I can't feel it though
The last one I had, made her damp the pitch
I tried to turn her way out, she couldn't handle it
You big freak! You big freak!

[Chorus]
I said it might sound crazy but she's in love
I said it might sound crazy but she's in love

[Outro: Too $hort]
