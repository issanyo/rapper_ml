Giving it up for all my niggas, both sides

Lowlife, check it out
I had to give y'all some gangsta shit to ride to
So get high than a mothafucka and drift em
To a world of violence, of money and scandalous bitches and niggas
That street life, that many is afraid to let you listen to
Why do we bang? Why do we bang for a living, we just don't know
Violence has been going on for a minute, but oh yeah
We on one, and if you feel me, peep me out
Peep out my shit and remember
That our motto is revenge, retaliation and get back
Yeah, put it down, put it down, just murderers, just murderers
If you don't he'll murder you, if you don't he'll murder you
Murder, murder
Daz Dillinger, Kurupt Young Gotti, we put it down like that
Check it out, biatch, biatch
Do you hear me, do you feel me
Biatch, hahah, yeah, Daz Dillinger
Retaliation, revenge and get back
