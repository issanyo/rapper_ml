[Intro]
Yeah look. It's Kurupt. Young Gotti. You know life's a bitch. And then you die nigga. Don't ask why nigga. Mom is pride nigga. Live your life nigga
Look, look

[Chorus][x2]
Living in world put against these beneath us that was born to die. Got to make a mistake in just respect and muth fuckas get high
Die, die, die - if we try, try, try. Mommas cry, cry, cry - as time flies, flies, flies. Heeey. (repeat)

[Verse 1]
Give me little bit of that cash and I'll be alright my nig. (My nig) Give me a little bit of that hash just chip me off a big, big, big. I'm out to get a grip. Make it happen fast and quick. Give up and down the strip. The homies on this pimping shit
Riding around LA to A and riding round back, back. You got a lot say, say. Then say that shit in my face
My woofers got a lot of base, base. And I don't even drive nigga. I kick back and enjoy my liquor
Sip and enjoy the ride nigga. See all that I want in my life is just a cool momma that's right
And just a gansta paradise inside my gansta paradise you'll find hoes, hoes, ballers on
Sitting on fours. Pimping these hoes. Monte Carlo does, clothes, Gucci penny loaves, loaves
Gansta than a mutha fucka like a G suppose. But if you get the trip and spit the ship to shift in each and everybody part existing throw this nigga up in the system. See me lift him, see me lift him...

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 2]
My homeboy just got shot. I almost lost my spot. I keep on trying to make it. I give it all I got. Who am I am to trust
It's not enough. I am trying to get all I can get up out this bitch and it's just singing off a thug. They rape my cuz
They got my shit, my bitch, my grip, my twist fucked up. Just brought a brand new SS siting on some D's
Just me (inaudible2:32) Snoop, Preas, Nate, Warren G, Soldy Mack pushing front to back. Let's ride big and little tribe
Look at this bitch on the ride. Nigga whats cracking tonight
Yeah a little something just to let you know about the squad. Ride role. Full control
Hoimies all up in pimp mode. Ganstafied this is just the beginning. My time to stop and then ending
It might feel like a couple of seconds. It might last about a minute. Look ain't tripping off of none of you niggas
Acting hard. Acting like a God. Imma bomb first than disperse. I;m the worse mutha fuka DPGC. Look....

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
Can fly and start and singing. You better earn your wings nigga. So you can fly and start singing, singing
That's cool I ain't tripping. Got my bitch up on my side. All my ganstas to the left. All my D boys to the right, right
Everything up in the middle there need to be some bitches. Cause if its not bitched we need to mop them niggas
This a BG boy affair. She ain't got on underwear. Who gives a fuck and who cares? Nigga we don't fuck around with you squares
Nigga

[Chorus][x2]
