[Intro: Kurupt]
Dogg Pound Gangstaz, yeah
Something I wanna do to you, D-A-Z wanna do to you, yeah

[Chorus: Kurupt + (Crystal)]
If you get money, mama, say it (ooh ooh)
All about your paper, getting paid, say it (ooh ooh), yeah
You got your thong on, baby? (ooh ooh)
And if you don't wear no panties, say it (ooh ooh)
Now if you got the bomb (yeah, I got the bomb)
If you got your own job (yeah, I got my own job), yeah
If you got it, let me feel it (ooh ooh)
Now shake it from the floor to the ceiling, say it (ooh ooh)

[Verse 1]
[Daz Dillinger]
Uh, this for them girls who like to say (ooh ooh)
Coming through in the blue coupe drop to scoop two, I'm so true
Being fly and so flashy
I don't know why, so don't ask me
The club is jam packed, hoochies front to back
Yo, it's 1 A.M. and it's about to crack
I mean that like the squads on a black card
I'll buy out you and you and the whole bar, then we gone
Yo, I'm having a blast, it's Kurupt and Daz
Back on a mission, yo, homie, because we born to mash

[Kurupt]
I'm just an average Joe, with a savage low low
Keep all my business on the low low, just so you know though
I'm aware, this is just a private affair
But that's cool, baby, that's the only reason I'm here
Wha'cha doin' with yourself? (What'cha doin' with yourself?)
Now let me see you do it with yourself (see you do it with yourself), yeah
I bet that I could get you high as a jet
What you think? My name Gotti, I'm Black Sphinx
This for you, now show these niggas how you do
Let me hear it one time (ooh ooh)
You get your hustle on, mama? (ooh ooh)
You sick of all the bullshit and drama? I thought so

[Chorus: Kurupt + (Crystal)]
If you get money, mama, say it (ooh ooh)
All about your paper, getting paid, say it (ooh ooh), yeah
You got your thong on, baby? (ooh ooh)
And if you don't wear no panties, say it (ooh ooh)
Now if you got the bomb (yeah, I got the bomb)
If you got your own job (yeah, I got my own job), yeah
If you got it, let me feel it (ooh ooh)
Now shake it from the floor to the ceiling, say it (ooh ooh)

[Verse 2]
[Daz Dillinger]
I'm feeling good with some drank, I got the goodness of the dank
I'm clownin', homeboy, we're back, you think we ain't?
I'm blowin' tons of smoke, I'm walking on clouds
It's the DPG and my cousin, Bigg Bow Wow

[Kurupt]
Excuse me, just let me intervene, a second of time
My name's Kurupt, what up? Naw, pleasure's all mine
All we here to do is get the G party in effect
Can you dig it? Well, listen, me and Daz on the left

[Daz Dillinger]
Now, wave your hands side to side if you're down with us
All the gangstas get your gats and prepare to bust
See, can't nobody do it better than us
So, get with the program or shut the fuck up

[Kurupt]
Choppin' up a little game, we had the spot poppin'
Had the party jumpin', in the party panty droppin'
Show me somethin', girl, it's like Girls Gone Wild
I let 'em be as wild as they wanna be, and now
Snoop and Nate got the ladies on the tables dancing
T-shirt and her panties on, titties and asses
I'm like, 'Damn, girl, what's the plan, girl?'
I get it, I understand, girl, you need a man, girl

[Chorus: Kurupt + (Crystal)]
If you get money, mama, say it (ooh ooh)
All about your paper, getting paid, say it (ooh ooh), yeah
You got your thong on, baby? (ooh ooh)
And if you don't wear no panties, say it (ooh ooh)
Now if you got the bomb (yeah, I got the bomb)
If you got your own job (yeah, I got my own job), yeah
If you got it, let me feel it (ooh ooh)
Now shake it from the floor to the ceiling, say it (ooh ooh)

[Outro: Crystal]
Ooh ooh...ooh ooh...
Ooh ooh...ooh ooh...
Ooh ooh...ooh ooh...
