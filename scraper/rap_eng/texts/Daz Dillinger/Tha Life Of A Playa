[Verse 1]
Oh shit, I hit it from the back doggy style
Baby was wild, pussy was foul
Oh shit, I'm wearing it out, diggin' her out
Show her what this dick is about (Say what?)
My three way does it, suckin' it out
And ain't nothin' like these girls down south
Bobby to the ground work that, fuck her the tongue
Workin' and showin' a nigga that I ain't havin' none
She love it rough, yeah, beatin' it up
I love the way she suck my dick, she eatin' it up
With cream and peaches, in room 112
Daddy your love around (Suck it), yeah bitch I can tell
Grip it tight, lick it all damn night
Fuck a nigga swale, fuck a nigga right
I'm high as a kite, I feel the [?]
Feelin' the feelin' that I can never assume to feel it
Spreadin it who ridin' the pussy, I'm straight killin' it
In the 64, bitch wieldin' it
Ride 'til the wheels fell off, I said it all
She give it to me free but you [?]

[Chorus]
This is the life of a motherfuckin' playa
Everywhere I go I got hoes upon my dick
This is the life of a motherfuckin' playa
Everywhere I go nigga I got hoes upon my dick
