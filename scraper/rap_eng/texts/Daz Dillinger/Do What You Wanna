[Intro: Kurupt]
Dogg Pound Gangstaz

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Daz and Kurupt. Kurupt and Daz
Addictive, methamphetamines in glass
The real McCoys, shit to turn niggas turquoise
Coming through this muthafucka dippin', smoking purple
Let me give y’all a little quick example
Of how muthafuckas get split and trampled
Runnin' through this muthafucka too G'd up
Baby Hump, Dash, Young Gotti Kurupt
What that DPG like?
I see you like what we like
DP like T-Lee like
That’s a six, muthafucka, I'm on the dice
We ride like, we roll like
Cockin' the 4 like, it's DP for life
Just a glance around the corner, all California
I'ma show you niggas how to do what you wanna

[Chorus: Kurupt & (Daz)]
I'ma show you niggas how to do what you wanna
(Dippin' through the streets on gold Daytonas)
I'ma show you niggas how to do what you wanna
(And this is for my niggas out in California)
I’ma show you niggas how to do what you wanna
(You know about us, we got the bomb)
I’ma show you niggas how to do what you wanna
('Cause I’ma show you niggas how to do what you want)

[Verse 2: Daz]
You know I'ma, I'ma, I'ma I’ma do what I wanna
Get up on your ass when we roll up on the corner
All up in my business like fool got a job
Yeah, we jack and rob, yeah, we do this like the mob
Stomp your ass out like 1, 2
Then we do what the fuck we gon' do
Beat a nigga ass 'til he can't take no more
This'll crank the floor, man, you already know
I gets liver than live, get stupid than stupid
To the music, the bass, shit, you know I'ma lose it
Diggy Daz won't abuse it but damn I'll try
Said I wouldn't act a fool but damn I lied
It's criznackin', anybody actin', I'm flippin' on 'em
Bounce, some move slow and some move fast on 'em
I'm bangin, swangin', Dogg Pound Gangstaz
Nigga, that's what I'm claimin', and that's where I'm aiming, cuz

[Chorus: Kurupt & (Daz)]
I'ma show you niggas how to do what you wanna
(Dippin' through the streets on gold Daytonas)
I'ma show you niggas how to do what you wanna
(And this is for my niggas out in California)
I'ma show you niggas how to do what you wanna
(You know about us, we got the bomb)
I'ma show you niggas how to do what you wanna
('Cause I'ma show you niggas how to do what you want)

[Verse 3]
[Kurupt]
Bangin' on these bustas, I'm G'd up
DP'd up, creased up
Impalas, it's Gotti
Life of the party, dippin' and ridin'
I've S Mack with a bitch on the side and a bitch on his lap
LT in the back
I don't give a fuck about what you talkin' 'bout
Yeah, I got the nickel, do you want it, nigga?

[Daz]
Hahaha, get 'em, hahaha, get 'em
Get up on they ass, me and niggas start to stick 'em
Make some fast, stitch him, man, get it all over
Take him on a ride on a hella rollercoaster
Gun in my holster, back on a mission
Pay attention, stop and listen for them niggas who dissin'
Stop, pause, think, then you will know
How them niggas get dissed and how G'd out the flow

[Chorus: Kurupt & (Daz)]
I'ma show you niggas how to do what you wanna
(Dippin' through the streets on gold Daytonas)
I'ma show you niggas how to do what you wanna
(And this is for my niggas out in California)
I'ma show you niggas how to do what you wanna
(You know about us, we got the bomb)
I'ma show you niggas how to do what you wanna
('Cause I'ma show you niggas how to do what you want)
