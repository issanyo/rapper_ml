Greetings loved ones
Whattup Niggas and Niggettes
West-Coast gangsta shit, you dig?

Dub C, Daz Dilli
Yeah, East side, West side
Y'all, know what it is

[Daz Dillinger]
Yeah! Pushing figures, prepare for the gangbang, throw it up
From khaki chucks, Daz and Dub
Yeah they know it's us
Get with it, I get ran over like a locomotive
Smoking explosives igniting, nigga it's time to blow it
Back up, back up to the essence of this G-Shit
West-coast gangsta shit - what I represent
D-D-D-DUB and Daz bringing that feeling to ya
Roll it up motherfucka, you know we had to do it
Pants saggin, grabbing, and clutching the flag
And i'm automatic, sporadic, a bulls-eye
Let 'em have it!
With a deadly combination, they asking how could'ya?
With the Long Beach mobs, the neighborhood hustlas
Murderous tactics, i'm mad cause I get it cracking
Wreck 'em, wreck 'em up, and whack 'em
Fuck 'em up and smack 'em!
Who got a problem with the homie, get at me!
I keep the big homie cock strapped on the back seat (B-b-brlaaa)

[Snoop Dogg]
Twah, twah stomp down, here we go
This is the only way that we know
Gangbang, slang came, pop lowriders
Policies, wallabies, solo pop collars
Swing out, hang out, way-aah
Cripshit, we never ever play ya, pay ya
Stay Out The Way! I get mine, all day, everyday - understand me?

[WC]
A family, pushing through the door to break through
With some shit the average nigga can relate to
Ladies! Throw ya kids up shaking, making goods
Niggas throw ya city up, represent your hood
It's been a minute since niggas undid it
But that nigga Daz and Dub
Show 'em how to hit it
'Till Dr. Dre drops imma stay tuned
But now I gotta let you know L.A.'s in the room
Rhyme with that LBC, we deep, no set trip, but a niggas feet with a skeet
Kick the chucks in the ass, fall like Cleese
Drop gwack down, put the hog in the streets
Never leave without a heat, who got beef
Call Master Pookie, a big boat, I ain't hard to reach
All you got to do is holla
I'm near bottom, with my pants down, feeding you kid's momma

[Snoop Dogg]
Twah, twah stomp down, here we go
This is the only way that we know
Gangbang, slang came, pop lowriders
Policies, wallabies, solo pop collars
Swing out, hang out, way-aah
Cripshit, we never ever play ya, pay ya
Stay Out The Way! I get mine, all day, everyday - understand me?

[Daz Dillinger]
Me and my nigga do the dance
To this with a handshot
Call, get it command and it's blam blam blam
Here I am!
That nigga Daz and the shady one (Sup)
WC, yo shit we the crazy ones
Damn, niggas acting like they hard, but they not
Untouchable to touch with the Glock (B-b-brlaaa)
Eastsider, Westsider setting shit on fire
We the best niggas to represent for the ride

[WC]
Yeah! Brla-brl-brl-brl-brl-brl-brl
Fuck 'em, buck 'em, leave 'em
I'm on the block, drinking it with my Desert Eagle
Hat cut, black top, rag drop
Makin' it hot, you fuckin' with them kind of niggas, letting the gat pop
Forever in the game, spit flame, ain't shit changed
DPG, Lench Mob, Big Swang
The larger the clip, the harder the hit
Nigga Daz and Dub, y'all started some shit

[Snoop Dogg]
Twah, twah stomp down, here we go
This is the only thing that we know
Gangbang, slang came, pop lowriders
Policies, wallabies, solo pop collars
Swing out, hang out, way-aah
Cripshit, we never ever play ya, pay ya
Stay Out The Way! I get mine, all day, everyday - understand me?
