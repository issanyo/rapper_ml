Ya know this is So So Daz
I'm tired of niggas talkin' shit like, "Daz this, Daz that"
Daz' Dat Nigga so you niggas better back back
Or get clapped, I ain't trippin', got the clip in
Smokin' bomb while I'm whippin' and you know I'm steady crippin'
Steady grippin' on that Nina trigger finger
In between ya if I stroke ya then them hollows come and steam ya
And motherfuckers know I'm still who I was
If I ain't changed for the crackers why change for the thugs?
I'm ridin' chrome, 24's, 25, 26's
Smokin' while we hollerin' at some bitches
We gettin' twisted with the law on my back
With a white Desert Eagle in the floor of the 'Llac
I charge niggas whatever to do a song now
Why wouldn't I homie, I'm from the Dogg Pound
And I ain't gotta wave the four around
'Cause on anybodys street, cats know it's a dogg town
One gun is all that I need to put you to rest
Pump, pump put two slugs dead in your chest
One gun is all that I need, all, all that I need
All that I need to put you to rest
One gun is all that I need to put you to rest
Pump, pump put two slugs dead in your chest
One gun is all that I need, all, all that I need
All that I need to put you to rest
Now when you see me and I'm fresh off the plane
With a pack of the Hait' in my hand
And I'm just bout to blaze it up, nigga I don't give a fuck
Prince of the West, blue star on my Chucks
Yeah, I'm still hittin' and dippin'
Fill tip in the clip and we ain't never been cool
And I ain't friends with your crew, I don't care who you know
Motherfucker, I'm against what you do
It ain't a bone in your body that I won't break
Stone that I won't take, mash your face until your dome ache
I'm in the ring still standin'
The peoples champ, I'm what they demandin'
We take the win, all you take is the LBC
We don't play that bitch nigga stay back
Or get your bitch ass laid back
By this Dogg Pound Gangsta, simple and plain black
One gun is all that I need to put you to rest
Pump, pump put two slugs dead in your chest
One gun is all that I need, all, all that I need
All that I need to put you to rest
One gun is all that I need to put you to rest
Pump, pump put two slugs dead in your chest
One gun is all that I need, all, all that I need
All that I need to put you to rest
One gun is all that I need to put you to rest
Pump, pump put two slugs dead in your chest
One gun is all that I need, all, all that I need
All that I need to put you to rest
One gun is all that I need to put you to rest
Pump, pump put two slugs dead in your chest
One gun is all that I need, all, all that I need
All that I need to put you to rest
