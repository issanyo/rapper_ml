[Chorus:]
All I see is signs, all I see is dollar signs [x3]
Money on my mind, money, money on my mind
All I see is signs, all I see is dollar signs [x3]
Money on my mind, money, money on my mind

[Verse 1:]
All I see is dollar signs, bitch I'm on the grind
In my truck I've got that columbine, don't try to take mine
Got your baby momma on my dick, I'm not even tryin
Last five years bought three houses, bitch, I'm not even signed
Club Godzilla, bitch, I got the juice, whip ain't got no roof
Folks was in the truck and sit obtuse, my whip is the truth
Run up on my shit I shoot, bitch don't lose your life
Keep your pistol, fuck a fight cause niggas out here jack every night
All I see is dollar signs, I don't need no visine
My eyes green, if you broke get from by me
If you ain't help me get it don't tell me how to spend it
Fucking loser, I've been gettin paper since the [?]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
This ain't what you want unless you got that mega-bucks my nig
I been doin shows, stay on the road, I'm on the tour, you dig
Smokin' [?] and all I see is dollar signs
Broke niggas make me sick, get off your dick and get up on your grind
Iâ€™ve been off the rocka poppin, I've been on my job moggin
Queen of Memphis in this bitch, ain't there a ho gon stop it, watch it
If it ain't a benefit for me I cannot fuck wit ya
Legend in this game, you know what I'm sayin', I ain't got time for the
Bullshit, bitch this the billionaire girls club
And there's a whole lotta rich niggas know whassup
They say I'm actin funny, and I ain't fuckin wit em
Nah, I'm gettin' to the money and you be bullshitin

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Money on my motherfuckin mind, gotta stack it up
Niggas wanna get it like they livin [?]
Keep that loot [?], no bullshit, can't blow for that
If this about a nigga you know we got that rat attack
Louie bag, pants sag, money weigh a nigga down
That nigga Daz from the motherfuckin Dog Pound
[?] benjamin, look at the Benz this nigga in
I'm a motherfuckin hustler, all I do is get it in
All we gotta do is make one phone call
We love and live big and never live small
With two pounds of Kush you know I light it up
Two-million in cash nigga, [?]

[Chorus]
