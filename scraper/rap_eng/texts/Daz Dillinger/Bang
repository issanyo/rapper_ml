[Intro: Kurupt]
G shit...

[Hook : Game & (Tha Dogg Pound)]
(You got them funny ass colors on, take it off)
If you in the club with ice on, we takin' off
(I thought you was a gangsta nigga, you better shake it off)
(What?)
(Sh-Sh-Shake it off, or get banged on)

[Verse 1 : The Game, (Daz) & "Kurupt"]
Gettin' my bang on, red strings on
Luis Vuitton kicks, Luis Vuitton frames on
Luis Vuitton belt holding the fo'-five
You know who I am bitch, I'm Mr. Westside
(This West West or nothin' - get your pistols, get your flag)
(Gangstas we love to sag, we cock it back and blast)
(Like booyaka-booyaka, we lay the party down)
(G-G-Game, Dogg Pound)
Everybody get down
"Look nigga... I nurture and breed"
"I ain't never gave a fuck about a bitches needs"
"And bitch niggas try to invade our town"
"I'mma lay 'em down, spray the 'K and get out"
Say goodbye to the '6-4, hello to the '6-trey
He ain't never seen hydraulics, look at his bitch face
Up, down - now watch my shit scrape
Daz call Snoop, I'mma Crip Walk to get Dre
And Blood Bounce back, heat on the track
Dribble rock like Wade and bounce like Shaq
Throw a O in the pot and watch it bounce right back
Like that (like that?) like that

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : The Game, (Daz) & "Kurupt"]
(We street connected, respected, I gets pathetic)
(When I did it I must've meant it, so nigga go and rep it)
(Lil' homies around her constantly on smash mode)
(Lil' niggas with pistols that blowin' out your asshole)
(Bang how we give it, the culture that we live in)
(Fresh out the hospital or fresh out the prison)
(Real niggas for life, the roots of the G tree
N.W.A., Dr. D-R-E)
We not S-T-A-R's, we don't put stars in our shoes
Bitch we put the whole car on the shoes
You don't wanna see my car on the news
I'll "Set It Off" like Queen Latifah, red beam on the nina
"Bang out, chipping in traffic, dipping the classic"
"Dipping to classics, whooping that ass"
"It's hood niggas ready to get it, your bitch can get it"
"Cause I know she'll suck a dick in less than a minute"
"Cuz, I'mma have to show him where the house at"
"Two milli Macs, semi-automatic situational attack"
"In the back with a sack, Cadillac all black"
"Like this and like that"
"Bang, broken like glass and plastic"
"Bang out on him with the mask and plastic"
"We got access to massive plastiques"
"Purchased last week, D.P.G.C"
"Bang"

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : The Game & (Kurupt)]
Here come them outta town niggas, what up Blood?
(What up cuz? They don't even know what 2Pac first album was)
Should I tell 'em Blood? (Nah, fuck 'em loc)
Me and Kurupt three-wheelin' on the hundred spokes
(Dash, brake, bounce and scrape)
Run up on the '6-4, see the AK's
(Bang) like Eazy, (Bang) like Dre
(Bang) like Snoop, (Bang) in L.A
(Bang) like Crips and Bloods
From now on, wear a Bathing Ape hoodie get stripped in the club
Like a bitch in the club, watch him strip in the club
You like ice creams? Get a banana split in the club
No jewelry, you can't wear shit in the club
And that go for every nigga and bitch in the club
So you better take it off 'fore you get in the club
Game and Dogg Pound along side sittin' on dubs
Remember that

[Hook]
