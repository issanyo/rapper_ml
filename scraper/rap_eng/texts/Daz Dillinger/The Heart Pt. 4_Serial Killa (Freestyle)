[Verse 1]
The greatest rapper with no page in the chapters
I pray to God that my flow's raised in the rafters
No break for you bastards, huh
You O'Shea as an actor
Sadly, it ain't no future playing your daddy
I sold yay' to my pastor and move 'caine in the alley
I strolled dangerous pastures, who's claiming to add me?
Don't tell a lie 'bout me
And I won't tell the truth 'bout you
The truth is, no man can silence me, I don't answer to nobody
No Birdman, no Jay-Z, no Yo Gotti
No drug dealer, no big homie, I'm so cocky
No thug's realer, whole clip on me, you won't stop me
Care less, don't mean that I'm careless
I fear less from a nigga who claiming they fearless
So hear this
I ain't got no pulse, I'm a clear wrist
So tears drip every time I speak and the snare hits (nigga)
Don't tell a lie 'bout me
And I won't tell the truth 'bout you
Let me roll up my damn sleeves
Stampede, cause you never could measure a man's greed
Man please, I can come to the hood when I damn please
Same nigga say you can't come back cause he can't leave
Why you wanna see Ran bleed?
I'm a legend, you should worship the air that this man breathe
All night, niggas be screaming it's on sight
But too blind to see that I'm the one giving 'em all life
All hype, got no war stripes
I poured more than Henny for niggas who lost life
Y'all niggas involved, right?
It ain't hard to give
They using our music to brainwash our kids
You can't live to starve, but can't starve to live
Burn bridges with niggas cause they can't guard the bridge
Thank God for this, don't got a script to copy
Say what I wanna say with no politics to stop me
Not a clip could drop me, not a bitch could block me
Not them critics riding somebody else dick can watch me
Watch me, don't tell a lie 'bout me
And I won't tell the truth 'bout you

(What's my muh'fucking name?)

[Verse 2]
I'm like Nas writing his first verse for "Illmatic"
Jay as a drug lord, and Em as pill addict
The devil is still at it
Had to write this to check if I still had it
Come mess with a real savage
The essence of real havoc, greatest rapper
Niggas claim to show you love, then they hate you after
Pay to clap ya, step like you Beta capa
Play the master, I ain't a actor
I'm aiming at ya with the vision of Deadshot, Squad is Suicide
My bars are do or die
Can't starve if you alive
Bang bang, pain gon' come
Let off about 50 in a 100 round drum
When the sun is down, run
Another clown done, blame Pop Dukes had his son around guns
I don't front around none
Suicide, it's a suicide
Drive-bys in a two door ride
Nigga do or die, who gon' live, nigga: you or I?
It's no fence, nigga, choose your side
Don't wanna lose your lives
I'm in the game, nigga you courtside
I spit the flame, nigga, truth or lie?
I'm your new tour guide
Through the streets where these niggas don't play games
I told y'all to feel my pain, what's my muh'fucking name?
