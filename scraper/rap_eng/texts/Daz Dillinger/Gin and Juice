With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kinda hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky ass shit every single day
I got bitches in the living room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' 'til six in the mornin'
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice (laid back)
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice (laid back)
With my mind on my money
And my money on my band

Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you ho's, I'm out the do' and I'll be

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice (laid back)
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice (beyotch!)
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
