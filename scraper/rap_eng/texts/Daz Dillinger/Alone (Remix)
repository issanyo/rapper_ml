Girl where is our child
Sent him to your mother's
For a while
All my friends are gone
You know I sent them home
Girl I live for you
So I don't give a fuck about the news
So please turn off the TV
And if you give a damn about me
I wanna hear you moan

Let's be alone
I wanna hear you moan
Let's be alone
So (that) we can get it on
Let's be alone
I wanna hear you moan
Let's be alone

Better than you and me
Better than a damn movie
Our love is so much fun
Let's do some freaky shit
And then I'll make you cum
What compares to us
I love we have so much trust
Tell me can you see
I was made for you and you for me
I wanna hear you moan

Let's be alone
I wanna hear you moan
Let's be alone
So we can get it on
Let's be alone
(And you know) I wanna hear you moan
Let's be alone

Come and see me baby
I'll be the nigga on the side
As long as you let me keep take you
For the long ride
...
And she said
That's the way the love goes
No, no, I don't think so
...
'Cause she would notice me
If I'd enrolled with Jodeci
Beep, beep, there goes my favourite
Now she won't not come on home with me

No baby
I swear ...
...
So we can do this
Yeah, all night long

Hey speacial lady, unplug the phone
Lady unplug that phone
'Cause no one is home, girl we're alone
There's no one around
Hey speacial lady, let's get it on
We can get it on
You know what's going on, if you wanna moan
Tell me, I wanna hear you moan

Let's be alone
I wanna hear you moan (baby)
Let's be alone
So we can get it on
Let's be alone
I wanna hear you moan (all night long baby)
Let's be alone
I wanna hear you moan
Let's be alone
I wanna hear you moan
Let's be alone
So we can get it on
Let's be alone
I wanna hear you moan
Let's be alone
