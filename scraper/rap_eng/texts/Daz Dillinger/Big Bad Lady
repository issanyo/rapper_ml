[Intro: Kevin Vernado & 2Pac]
Rage...Rage...Rage...
Rage...Rage
Rockin' rough and tough with them afro puffs
Rage...Rage
The baddest lyricist born

[Verse 1: The Lady of Rage]
I bust on leathers, leave 'em frying in a griddle
In the middle like Monie
You're phony 'cause your style's bologna
But I rock with no filler, ain't a girl MC iller
Puttin' rappers on ice, then lock the bodies in a chiller
The way I fucks it up, I upchuck nasty style like throw-up
Blow up, then go nuts, like a lady Ninja killa
I'll drill deep beneath the surface
It's the Rage, front page, I heat up like a furnace
My steelo gots bulk
Check the gamma rays from the She-Hulk
Stomping through your territory
New rap female category winner
And your style gets played out like The Spinners
Not a soprano, or alto, the Rage is a tenor
My voice is just right
I bust hypodermics to your inner minds eye
Makin' you hip-hop junkies wanna fly
Like eagles, my style sharp as cathedral steeples
Showin' and improving even a lady can be diesel
So uh, breaka, breaka, you best keep on truckin', unh unh
And roll on with that chicken shit you're cluckin'
You're stuck in stupid you doofis
I'm rhymin' so hard, I'm knockin' out your toofis
Or teefis, believe this shit
You Butthead, you'll get played out like Beavis
Receive it, it's yours, lyrical murderer still rockin' on

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Rock on, rock on
The Lady of Rage, lyrical murderer
The baddest lyricist born

[Verse 2: The Lady of Rage]
Now I'm a explosive vocalist, make you readjust your focus
No hocus-pocus, no bogus, I'm the dopest
Lyrically the loc'est, it's all copacetic
I see through your synthetics with my telekinetics
I mean my telepathics, from this mouth of madness
Flow's one of the baddest in existence
My existence is prevalent, hesitant not, you'll get dropped
I'm rhymin' so hard I see it knocking out snot
'Cause I slam like collisions on your vision of me
Is you can't touch it, not even a smidgen of me
You're pigeon shit to me, so drop it
(Damn... hit this shit, Rage)
I take a puff then I blow up like Moby
Runnin' lyrics quicker than Toby
What's my name? Yeah, you know me
Rage, lyrical murderer, what's my name?
Yeah, it's Rage, lyrical murderer, yeah, you know me
So if you wanna see me, turn on your headlights
I'll make you run red lights, tryna catch it
Slam into the Rage you'll end up wreckage
Towed away, blowed away, cut down, mowed away
Curled up like Ola Ray
So let me straighten it out 'cause I'm a thriller
Muthafuckin' MC cold killer
When I cock back, you better drop dat, yo, hop back
I rock dat 'til dawn, yes, I still rock on

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Rock on, rock on
The Lady of Rage, lyrical murderer
The baddest lyricist born
Rock on, rock on
The Lady of Rage, lyrical murderer
The baddest lyricist born

[Verse 3: The Lady of Rage]
Now when it comes to the hippest in hip-hop
I make the lips drop, knees knock, buckle and shake
Now who select the wrong move?
Get dusted, busted
Wack MC's who can't cut the mustard
I stick it to you like voodoo
So who do you think you're foolin'?
Not Rick, but rulin', ha
You couldn't hang with a noose
Your goose will get cooked
Look up in the sky
It's fly Robin fly, givin' whatever suits you
Got the size 8 Timberland, to boot cha
Oops upside your head
Ayo, I'm seein' red like a bull
Baby, I got to pull of an ox
Redd Foxx couldn't out-fox me, because I'm Foxy Like Brown, unh, break it down now
From the end to the start, lyrical murderer
Pumps fear in, hearts I'm tearin', parts to pieces
Like Reese's, I freaks it, speak it in tongues
Put you on like Bonita Applebum
You can't see me, you're blind to the fact I'm all that
Swingin' on the wack, strikin' 'em out like bats
Hats off, blast off, watch me rock it
Sock it to ya, whatever it takes to do ya
Done, top gun
It's The Lady of Rage still rated number one, muthafucka!
