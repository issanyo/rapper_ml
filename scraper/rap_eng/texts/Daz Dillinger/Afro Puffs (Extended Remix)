[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Damn, look what the wind blew in
From the depths of the sea
It's the S-N-double O-motherfucking P
In the place to be
And this time I came with the homegirl R-A-G-E
So let me begin
To slowly start to flow but let me grab my cup of gin
Then look, the crook, it's me
Who be the D-O-double to the G
I fly through the sky like a dove once again
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg -- can I blend, men?
Then send more than you need
Can I have some bags so I can roll up the weed?
I take a glance, in other words a chance
I spot myself up on the dance floor taking a dance
I got a bitch on my dick, some niggas talking shit
But ain't no need for me to call my clique
Cause DPGC be the clique that the D-O-double G belongs to
I wrote a song to the track that's provided by my nigga Dr. Dre
Now slowly start to slide into a trance, move around
And get hooked, lady, by the sounds of the Pound
We got the hits that just don't stop and they don't quit
Cause once again, Snoop Dogg is 'bout to drop some shit, bitch
I can't stop, I pop
Never flip, I flop
Snoop Dogg got the shit that don't stop
Rock on with your bad self
It's The Lady of Rage at the top of the shelf
So push the button, run, because
Snoop Dogg is on the mic and I'm a dope motherfucker
Yeah, you best ask somebody
About the man with the la di da di
I got the shit that makes your body shake
It's time for you to stop, pause, and awake
Open up your eyes and stay composed
It's one nine nine four -- I still don't love hoes
I treat them the same -- it's like the boom bam
It's Snoop Dogg, I'm on the mic; can I slam?
Yes you can, and you just don't stop
C'mon, say what, and you just don't stop
Uh, yeah, and you just don't quit
Hey yo Rage, could you please drop some gangsta shit

[Hook: The Lady of Rage and Snoop Dogg]
I rock rough and stuff with my Afro puffs
[Rock on with your bad self]

[Verse 2: The Lady of Rage]
I rock on with my bad self cause it's a must
It's The Lady of Rage still kicking up dust so, uh
Let me loosen up my bra strap and umm
Let me boost you with my raw rap
Cause I'mma break it down to the nitty gritty one time
When it comes to the lyrics, I gets busy with mine
Busy as a beaver, you best believe-a
This grand diva's running shit with the speed of a cheetah
Lyrical murderer
I'm serving em like two scoops of chocolate
Check out how I rock it
I'm the one that's throwing bolos
You better roll a Rolo
To find out I'm the number one solo
The capital R-A -- now kick it to the G-E
I'm bringing things to light but you still can't see me
I flow like a monthly, you can't cramp my style
For those that try to punk me, here's a Pamprin, child
No need to say mo', check the flow
Rage in effect once mo', so now you know

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now I'm hitting MC's like Hadouken
Ain't no doubt about it, I'm the undisputed
So what you want to do is back on up
I'll tap that butt, wax the cuts, pass the bucks
So put your money on the bread winner
I kick lyrics so dope that the brothers call 'em head spinners
I got the tongue that is outdone anyone
From the rising to the setting of the sun
Or the moon, I consume the room with doom
When I hear the kick of a 808 bass...boom
Boom, bam, Goddamn!
I'm hitting so hard you could say it's a grand slam, dunk
Punks get broken off for chunk when they feel the funk
Of the rhythm (fresh) that I give 'em
Let it hit 'em, split 'em, did it -- now I'm rid of 'em, yeah
I put that on my unborn kids
Rage in effect so you know how it is

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Now ever since my debut, I've continued to lay you
Flat on your back from the raps that I spat, spit
Oh shit, I'm the shit
You can't get with the Rage, then tough titty
I pity the fool that gets
With the lyrical murderer cause my shit is rude
You wanna get with the wickedness?
With that big-bodied girl that's kicking it
Ripping it apart like Jason
You'll be chasing a dream like Freddy
Are you ready for the cream de la creme?
I'm steam pressuring those who ain't measuring up
I keep competitors stuck
In the muck with they butt up
What, you want to nut up like cashew?
Don't you know that I will mash you?
For real, that's the deal, I'm straight out of Farmville, VA
[Snoop: So what you gotta say?]

[Hook]

I am the roughest, roughest, roughest [Snoop: Say what? Say what?]
I am the toughest, toughest, toughest

Get with the uhh, roughest, roughest
Get with the uhh, toughest, toughest
Get with the uhh, roughest, roughest
Get with the uhh, toughest, toughest
Get with the uhh, wickedness, roughest
I am the uhh, wickedness

[Outro - Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Yeah, one-nine-nine-fo'
The indo blow and the grass grow
Snoop Doggy Dogg still don't love a ho
But you gotta give credit when credit is due
Women back down and bow down
To my motherfucking homegirl The Lady of Rage
She rocks rough and stuff with the Afro Puffs
Handcuffed as she busts
And trick biatch, she's guaranteed to tear shit up
You know what I'm saying?
