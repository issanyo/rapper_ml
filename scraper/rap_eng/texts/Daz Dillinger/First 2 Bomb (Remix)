[Intro: Daz]
Yeah... knockin' niggas the fuck out
Y'all niggas know how we do
Yeah nigga, you know how we do when we ride up on your bitch ass

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Tell me baby, what's your frequency
You see I'm makin' proposals that's full of verbal indecency when ya meetin' me
Flash light I'm buzzed, wasn't right like drugs
Got 3 strikes, you got these last night's for thugs
Holdin' my position my competition is never ready
Ripped like a machete, my alias Makaveli
So what they tell me through the grapevine
Niggas ain't tryin' to see me paid, they rather take mine
Retaliation takes time
Create rhymes, that so ferocious that the bass line
Went for my vocals every time a nigga say it rhyme
Spendin' and bustin' you thought you was but you wasn't, prepared
Niggas is scared, I'm eternally thuggin'
Like Kamikazes on a suicide mission I'm spittin'
Multiple gunshots, burnin' turnin' rappers to victims
I kick 'em all day, and our motto was make 'em all pay
You think you rough enough? Nigga you crawl away

[Chorus: 2Pac & Daz]
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Come be my enemy killa, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Come be my enemy killa, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride

[Verse 2: Daz]
That's when the slaughter begin, that's when I murdered your friend
On the news of ten , your homie got then
You crazy ass thinking its back runnin', runnin'
Runnin' the streets again, with AKs and Mac-10s
[?], livin' America wanted
This on escape from the heaters [?]
You and your homie is gone, when we ride up on you
And we ride like a roller, all dog to talk
5 double o B-E-N-Z DAG
DPG showin' the place to be
Wow this [?] will split the fella in flat
Leavin' suckers stuckin'
Gang bang bang
I'm from the mad ass dogg pound
Always down for the dolo
Nigga you know we ghetto fo fo
Niggas screamin' a "oh no"
Showing proof on nigga we cuttin' your throat motherfucker

[Chorus: 2Pac & Daz]
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Come be my enemy killa, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Come be my enemy killa, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
First to bomb, quick to unload
Expose, my foes, for being bitches
Keepin' niggas suspicious, 2 Glocks
Is filled with ammo
My army fatigues ready for battle
Lyrical commando, let's get it on
Tell me nigga, how much you can handle
Bangin' on wax, I turn the track into a Roman Candle (boom)
My intention specifically, thugged out, no sympathy
Pictures of closed caskets, soon as Daz's get with me
I'm first to bomb, first is the calm, then the panic
Soon as my niggas break, we earthquake the whole planet
Adversaries can't understand it
The way my niggas strategize
Don't nobody die unless we planned it
Life long committed, I write songs and spit it
No matter how hard mothafuckas try they can't get it
It's West Coast, Westside, Outlawz 'til we die, Thug Life
Mothafuckas on the ride and we--

[Chorus: 2Pac & Daz]
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Come be my enemy killa, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Come be my enemy killa, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride

[Verse 4: Daz]
I come from battle rap, nigga imagine that
For every nigga that you got I got for the match
Nigga you better give it up nigga or die for its spot
The cash and jewelry get my avenges kinda blind
My vision ain't blurry, told mama don't worry
Now I got the streets strapped, the stripes in glory
If I live to tell a story about the gangstas and thugs
The homies [?] that drug through the mud
And you dog your own rate [?]
Weed, money, alcohol, with AKs
Sprayed flap for your dope and you're not
Come beating then you bow for the niggas get shot, motherfucker

[Chorus: 2Pac & Daz]
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Come be my enemy killa, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Come be my enemy killa, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride

Yeah, y'all bitches can be
Knocking all y'all [?] off your heads, yeah
Fuck [?], it's the [?]
Fuck that, yeah, we'll live with that
