[Intro: 2Pac]
One love to my homeboys, death to my enemies
Bad boy killaz, Outlaw muthafuckin' Immortalz
You know what time it is
When we ride (when we ride)
Thug niggas 'til the day we die

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Tell me baby, what's your frequency?
You see I'm makin' proposals that's full of verbal indecency when ya meetin' me
Flash light I'm buzzed, was writing like drugs
Got three strikes, you got these last nights for thugs
Holdin' my position, my competition is never ready
Ripped like a machete, my alias Makaveli
So what they tell me through the grapevine
Niggas ain't tryin' to see me paid, they rather take mine
Retaliation takes time
Create rhymes that so ferocious that the bass line
Went for my vocals every time a nigga say his rhyme
Spendin' and bustin' you thought it up, but you wasn't prepared
Niggas get scared, I'm eternally thuggin'
Like kamikazes on a suicide mission, I'm spittin' multiple gunshots
Burnin' turnin' rappers to victims
I kick 'em all day
And my motto, make Biggie Smalls pay
I make it ruff enough, you and Puffy crawl away

[Hook: 2Pac]
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Outlaw Immortal my nigga, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Outlaw Immortal my nigga, when I see you eye to eye

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
First to bomb, quick to unload
Expose my foes for being bitches
Keepin' niggas suspicious
2 Glocks is full of ammo
My army fatigues ready for battle, lyrical commando
Lets get it on
Tell me nigga, how much you can handle
Bangin' on wax, I turn this track into a roman candle (boom)
My intention's specifically, thugged out no sympathy
Pictures of closed caskets, soon as Daz's get wit' me
I'm first to bomb, first there's the calm then the panic
Soon as my niggas break, we earthquake the whole planet
Adversaries can't understand it
The way my niggas strategize
Don't nobody die unless we planned it
Life long committed, I write songs to spit it
No matter how hard muthafuckaz try, they can't get it
It's Death Row
Westside, outlaws 'til we die, thug life
Muthafuckaz on the ride and we

[Hook: 2Pac]
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Call me my enemy killer, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Outlaw Immortal my nigga, when I see you eye to eye

[Verse 3: Napoleon]
Nigga, I've been straight feudin' for years
Ain't nuthin' nice right here
I get the poundin' from the drum, that's how I overcome fear
Give me your soul out ya life, hand it to me like I'm Christ
I look at death to be nice, I wanna try it some nights
And I swear to God, I get medieval on your bastard catch wreck
Mama told you to knock me out, but you ain't knock shit yet
You wanna bet, I make the bitch come straight outta you
Claimin' you mobbin' deep, with your pity ass crew
Don't let me tell you what some real ass niggas would do
If you a soldier, ask ya homie could it be me and you
Head up first, I'll kill your work, I got you lost so you hurt
A flurry combination then I leave your dick in tha dirt

[Verse 4: Kadafi]
Nigga, I leave you shell shocked
From project streets to cell blocks
Glock 45 with the tail cocked
Makin' jacks by no means
Pocket full of crack and money stacks in my jeans
Wildin' on ya street high off codeine's (codeine's)
I want it all, fuck the talk
I, ask some questions after I open fire on your sector
On the fuckin' walk by

[Verse 5: E.D.I Amin]
Uh
Now how many niggas really think they can oppose
The Immortal Outlawz, you niggas is hoes but already seen it though Malc
Alias Amin comma E.D.I, drama is needy
So you gettin' stole on by, a hungry pointin' wantin' B.G
Dumpin', but takin' it out first at every function
Nigga, we funkin' at the stow we blows
Is hittin' yo jaw and now you hittin' the flo'
Obvious you didn't know what we known fo'
Nigga we
