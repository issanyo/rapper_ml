[Verse 1]
You little niggas better get back or get your lineup pushed back 
Stay strapped like a dike or a kid riding shit up at six flags wonder years I enjoyed that
This man stays equipped with some venomous shit 
Thinking of how I keep creating classical hits
Im the same dick who bussed in your bitch like a gat filled with numerous leave you feeling blue like lilo and stitch
No respect for you niggas trying to copy my slang got a shorty from the islands thats a foreign exchange
Your boy been sick ever since I copped the flu games ironic well touché
If a rapper ain't Wayne or Drake they gone be 2 Chainz so Ima take my talents and upgrade from loose change 
Im on my grind like Lupe one kick push knock off a nigga tupe
Niggas hate cause Im that great something like the five lakes I run shit up in every state 
Send a nigga to the pearly gates in a flat bed chevorlee R.I.P
Metaphorically speaking y'all in lyrical debt all y'all niggas owe me until y'all pay me respect 
He holding a nine he holding a reck only difference in mine is that Im holding my set 
U.G.C on deck should be the first amendment that grinch colored kush really got me tripping 
Please don't pre-judge me off of what Im sipping income with no job moms swear Im pippin no scottie 
Spanish chick waiting on me in the lobby fuck you green bean niggas cause we smoking on that broccoli 
You niggas so sweet no chicken teriyaki never learned to ice skate but my wrist on hockey 

[Hook]
Stars are all in line, baby you can be mine just like diamonds the way we shine your a work of art
Flawless at your best better than the rest put my hands across my chest your a work of art
These words I convey are a work of art these half ass rappers get ripped Go back to start go find where you left your heart
These words I convey are a work of art these half ass rappers get ripped Go back to start go find where you left your heart for false remarks get ghost by the flames I toss

[Verse 2]
Im the modern day black poet insquiscally heroic lyrical darts filled with led poison 
Step back before I buss one at your soldiers fuck it POP POP POP POP nigga I warned him
You got a problem my nigga then we can solve it on my boss shit for real step in my office
If you want a war my real niggas be swarming you think its a problem just wait until we start touring
We living your whole lifestyle is just boring Im so fly like the doors on Porsches Or just maybe red bull should endorse no S on my chest I prefer a Polo horse Won't see eye to eye its like we on a different course you got stuck on the bench should've played a different sport
No points No assists my nigga get off the court you couldn't even hang your bitch told me your short
