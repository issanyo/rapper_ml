16 switches Spitta
Curren$y the Hot Spitta
Huh

[Hook]
New Orleans, some call it the Big Easy
Everything in New Orleans ain't always what it seem
Yah you might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I been there all my life and I'll forever hold it down
I'm gon' listen up for my people
On y'all I could never turn my back
Hell naw homie I'm too deep in it
And Imma represent it for as long as I'm living

[Verse]
Game time in the land where niggas will be your best friend
Fuck around and then be a killer at the same time
If you be where I be
Then you know I ain't lying
G recognize G
You better respect my mind
If not then I'm left with no choice
Then to call all my dogs that attack when they hear my voice
Might see me and Weezy chiefing in a Rolls Royce
Armed with a bossy bitch who's jazzier than Jazzy Joyce
Wait let me lace it up
Breakfast in a Delaware
Punch when I'm waking up
My last girl left, caught herself breaking up
See me on the T.V. now she trying to make it up
I ain't got no space for her
Maybe the money is changing me a little bit
'Cause if you see it in the mall then I don't even wear that shit
Make them haters sick, the doctor's got to take care of it
I know they fly so I don't mind if she stare at my kicks
"Bitch I'm made" that's all I got to say
That's why these niggas bugging, 'cause this girl trying to wave
"Bitch I'm made" that's all I got to say
Can't see you niggas 'cause your ho's in my way

[Hook]
