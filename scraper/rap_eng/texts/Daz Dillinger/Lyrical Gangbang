[Intro]
This should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential area

[Verse 1: The Lady of Rage]
Now I'ma kick up dust, as I begin to bust
On the wick-wack, fucked up suckers you can't trust
When I kick up, I lick up, your face get smacked up
When I rack up, so all you mothafuckas just pack up
Or get slapped with the swiftness
If you think you're swift with the gift, Merry Christmas
Now stuff that in your stockin'
I'm knockin' 'em out the box and
Knockin' 'em out their socks and, cause Robin is rockin'
Breakin' 'em down to the slab
Takin' 'em down on their ass
Now what you wanna do, ya wanna battle, uh?
Send you up shit creek without a motherfucking paddle
Rattle that brain, I'm not that same ol' plain Jane
Roll on you like a boulder, you're nothin' more than a grain
Or a pebble, take it from the real rap rebel
Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to that other level
You think you got pull? Then pull it, uh!
I got the trigger so I figure you'll bite the bullet
Then bite the dust and wipe the fuss
Do what I must, and what I must is bust
A bubble, or two some trouble, for you
So skip to my Luger, Lady of Rage is comin' through

[Interlude: King Tee + B-Real]
Some cool shit
Some cool shit
Boo-yaa! Spittin' out buckshots

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
I fears no one, I makes 'em cool off like a polar cap
Lynchin', as a hit, misses the roll of dice
Pushin' packs to make a profit
Diggy dope duck on the topic so stop and gimme my props, kid
I'm livin' large like a fat bitch
So get back, bitch, I'm hard to bogart, for the faggots
This young black kid, a mercenary, merciless
Murderin' millions of niggas so who's first to diss
They say I'm bad so you'll find none worse than this
Chewing motherfuckers up like a Hershey Kiss
Put to sleep, loving the lyrics I leave in the minds of each
Rough when flex, too complex, wrecks your mental piece
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half niggas
You're quick to talk shit, I whoop your ass nigga
Then watch me blast, nigga, cause I'm the last nigga
You wanna fuck wit', so up your cash, nigga
I make 'em stagger, I'm scandalous as Jimmy Swaggart
I'm a good tracker, scopin' your girl then watch me tag her
Pulling steel like a stunt
Shown like an ID card, nigga, no needs to front, so
Here to torment I put track on crack
And I'm strapped with a semi-tone mili-ten Mac
Yo, I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, chief
Deadly as Jason on Friday the 13th

[Interlude: B-Real]
A to the motherfuckin' K

[Verse 3: RBX]
Back in the days, niggas they use to scrap
But now in ninety two, niggas they pull their strap
Cause umm, police them come wicked and them shoot
Niggas, so niggas retaliate and start to loot, execute
Boot stompin'
Black soldier, here to teach and mold ya
The innovator, dominater, narrarator
R-B to the mothafuckin' X, flex wicked
Styley Lee, bump and be found and do bleed by a
Maniac, with a gat
See nowadays niggas is like that
I pull my trigger back, the bullets go
Bo-bo-bo! Now I'm on Death Row
Fuck it, niggas goin' wild
Every night they shoot, it's like Beirut
Maybe you should get a Kevlar vest for your chest
Anytime steppin' through my hood
But that'll do you no good
One slug to your face, don't hate
You're gettin' smoked like wood
Nasty nigga bloody pumps face flat
On the concrete, here comes the white sheet
Mr. Coroner, caught with some yellow tape
But the murderers escape
Audi like 5 G's
Lyrical Gangbang but it's just a G thang
