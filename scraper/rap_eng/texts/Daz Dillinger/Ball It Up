Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
I ball it up and throw it down
I miss blow up money, it don’t matter
Guiness book of World Records
Show how that pussy eat is definitely fatter
Acrobatic like Abby, going kill that girl of matter
And when she done twirking I got something to tell her
Some to show her, some to give her, special delivery
Face down, ass up, put her on her misery
With an ass like that you know her mama must be up and trying
She said she is, you see her jewel at the blue flame
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
I pull up, I jump out, I ball up, I throw it at them
I was having your pussy good, your gold, your pussy platinum
She 21, come give me some, I like them smart, I like them dumb
Girl, you’re the one, girl, you’re the one, girl, you’re the one, girl, you’re the one
Could be a dollar, could be five, could be a hundred, girl, you survive
You look so good, you look so hot
You look so good, girl, you look so fly
The DJ’s spinning and you’re spinning on a pole
All I wanna see is that pussy hole
Into the night you know what it is, you know how to fuck this story, go
A sexy freak when she starts to move
She sex mechaninc, you know she got the right tool
Ain’t no rule to dollar bills, crispy as she got a chip
Doing what I gotta do, poc, poc, take a pill
The low pack’s too strong, gonna smoke all night long
Do it how you wanna do it, ain’t nothing go really wrong
You know the song, you know the song
Come over here, take off that thong
You know the song, you know the song
Come over here, take off that thong
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
Ball it up and throw it down
