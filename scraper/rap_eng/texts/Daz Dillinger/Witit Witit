Been with it for the junk, going hard on a nigga, cut the trunk
Lay low when the bullets fly
Putting down the window while I’m getting hela high
Don’t try to play me, don’t try me
Late night, lights out, going crazy
You know the bitches love a nigga way
Laying here nigga, what you wait?
What you’re waiting for? Niggers start to talk about it
Could that be in that the ship you mean to ship ‘em out
Nigga take the other round, for nigga try to shit, you bust the nigga out
You know what I’m about, know what it is
Call a nigga dance out, cannot handle biz’
Never been friends, always been folks
Your girl like my lady, your bitch is my main hoe
DPGV star, grow up in the city, started off I came off
Nigga couldn’t hand with us
So nigga that’s all, you bust the rest
I’m thinking G all the time
Say you bust a nigga sitting high on a sad line
I can’t recognize game or mind
Talking shit so I bust in line like
You know I’m witit witit, I’m witit witit
Still what you’re mad now on?
I’m getting it done, I’m witit, witit
Everyday the town we go, I’m witit, witit
You know I’m witit, witit, you know I’m witit, witit
That’s what your girlfriend know, I’m witit, witit
That’s what your boyfriend know, I’m witit, witit
I’m from whatever that goes, I’m witit, witit
Nigga, step the game up
Put your lanes while I got that damn tough
And a bad big nigga’s down
Them niggers running down, niggers looking like crayon
Get with it, I can love the high
Mind of a killer, that’s big time
What my spaceship jumped in
Throw it over here, yeah, nigga, that’s nothing
So we’re worried about
Hit your black cock and I’m wearing you out
Got a blunt in my mouth, hard times and I’m blowing it off
Real life, real lesson, pack the money fucking thing, no stressing
Pitbulls in my frontyard, real niggers, real money, yeah, we hit hard
Dark PPG in this, catch you niggers checked off for my hind list
Damn, back one hand on them, put them things down, imma bang bang on ‘em
The life of the legend, real scream nigga, yeah, nigga sad
Bitches all love me, niggers all hate me
Fuck you, nigga, pay me
You know I’m witit witit, I’m witit witit
Still what you’re mad now on?
I’m getting it done, I’m witit, witit
Everyday the town we go, I’m witit, witit
You know I’m witit, witit, you know I’m witit, witit
