[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Got me up against the fence, back against the wall
Get to actin' like a fool if ain't no justice for the Dogg
Got to take it out on all y'all
Better read the papers all my homies goin' crazy
Baby only God can save us
Got my... mind on currency, hurried, see I ain't worried
It's a gangsta party, so Bad Boy gettin' buried
Snoop Dogg why they fantasize? (Fantasize)
When we ride it's a must adverseries die, every time...

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm so smooth about my paper, check it, this how it's done
I'm servin' many on the platter Snoop Dogg Corleone (Corleone, Corleone)
Now do you know what that mean?
The Teflon Don to this hip-hop game, super supreme
It's like what happened can happen
But will it stop? That won't happen!
I'm feelin' good about the mission for jackin'
Ayo 'Pac... (Can you feel me?)
Why these fools... (Tryin' to kill me?)
It's so hard to stay focused on my eyes and prize
But if I don't, then Dogg won't survive (Survive)

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
We ballin' in my opinion, eternal it's wild-wheel spinnin'
Once implemented it's represented for five minutes
Two of the livest, wanted dead or alive, we riders
Ban us because we inquired and watch the G's Rides
Two of America's Most, straight out the West Coast (West Coast!)
Bow down fool, this is Death Row (For life!)
Been waitin' way too long, fresh out the pen, now it's on
C'mon Snoop Dogg, time to bone

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
Ain't nothin' changed, stay down to hang or slang or bang with a rhyme
Me and the homie 'Pac trippin', Death Row on ours
Strong survivor, Eastsider, DPG
Still creep and crawl through the hood, always involved in the streets
It's Doggy Dogg homie, did you forget who I was?
The Bigg Homie to you, there it is and there it was

[Refrain: 2Pac]

[Verse 5: 2Pac]
Ain't no love for a real G
Straight cowards, all you playa haters kill me
Throw up your hands if you feel me
We gettin' dollars, homie, holla if you hear me
This one time for my comrades doin' bad locked down
Fresh out, busta, time to bounce, drop down
Can you visualize perfection?
'Cause every rider in my set labeled a vet, best in his profession
Don't hold your breath, sleep with Smith & Wesson
Steady study your lessons and keep the crowd guessin'
