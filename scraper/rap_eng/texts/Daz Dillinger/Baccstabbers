[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
What's up, what's up
Where you at nigga, on my way nigga
Nigga, nigga
Yeah, what's goin' on
They don't know about that new shit huh
Where you at, up bitch if ya let me

[Mark Morrison]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Daz Dillinger]
Out of the clear, blue sky makin' it happen
Also shit we stackin'
Crushin' and bustin' upon all these backstabbers
I seen em' in traffic, it's Daz Dillinger
He ain't familiar with us
How I getsdown and gets up
Scopin' out the scene, forever makin' green
Stabbed in the back, plot and scheme
Me, Tray, and Mark get busy
After dark rippin' in my park
From the end to the start
So tell me homeboy what it is
I thought we was down to the end
My next of kin tryin' to blast me to the end
What it is I thought that we was down till the end
What it is, backstabbers

[Mark Morrison]
Said ya was my brother, brother
But you ain't no brother, brother
Turnin' ya back on me
And it turns to jealousy
Said she was my sister, sister
But you ain't no sister, sister
Treatin' a mack this way
Dodgin' me all day
I thought you was my back (Yes I did)
Cause we all still black (So true)
And no matter what you do (No, no, no)
I could always count on you (Oh)

[Daz Dillinger]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Hook: Daz Dillinger (Mark Morrison)]
(Backstabbers) Who's supposed to be ya friend (Backstabbers)
The one that be down to the end (Backstabbers)
Soon they stab you in the back (Backstabbers)
What I'm supposed to do, stab em' back (Backstabbers)
Who's supposed to be ya friend (Backstabbers)
The one that be down to the end (Backstabbers)
Soon they stab you in the back (Backstabbers)
What I'm supposed to do, stab em' back (Backstabbers)

[Mark Morrison]
Girl he ain't my brother
How is he my brother
Turnin' backs on me
And it turns to your envy
Swearin' she my sister
But how is she my sister
Servin' suits on me
Negative plublicity, listen
I thought she was my back (Yes I did)
Cause we all still black (So true)
And no matter what you do (No, no, no)
I could always count on you
Brother can't you see
That he usin' you against me
And no matter what they say
Mack Daddy's here to stay

[Hook]

Backstabbers, like a flagrant foul with no damn sound
How dare you try to stop big pimpin' slow
When the life of the flavor is my ho
Layin' between the lines lyrically
Inclined to come off divine
Every mack in time, against all that

[Mark Morrison]
I thought you was my brother
Cause we all still black
And no matter what you do
I could always count on you
Sister can't you see
They're plottin' you against me
And no matter what they do
My love will come to you (Tray Deee)

[Tray Deee]
When I return like the mack then I cause disaster (Yeah)
Bangin' on these wack, back stabbin' bastards (What)
Perhaps it's a lack of true macks that's rappin' (Uh)
While people don't be knowin' what's exactly happenin'
But try to play me, Tray Dee will clashin'
Cause I brand these Magnums and blast the fastest
Don't ask if I'm massive to grab my stashes
I last in the past puttin' plans in caskets
Daz and the Mack in the back be flashin'
And havin' it lavish with smashin' classics
Act like mack life ain't no joke
Burnin' youth hang in Cali where the pistols smoke (What)

[Mark Morrison (Daz)]
Backstabbers...backstabbers (What ya say now) Backstabbers
(What ya say now) backstabbers (What ya say now) Backstabbers
(What ya say, what ya say) backstabbers

[Hook to fade]
