[Intro: Pat Stay]
Uh, yeah
Pat Stay, sucka!

[Sample: Snoop Dogg]
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
(*scratching*)
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
(*scratching*)
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?

[Verse 1: Pat Stay]
Uh, yeah, you know, Mr. "Sucka Free"
It's been a while
Y'all wondering what's up with me?
Ain't nothing sweet, but I stayed positive
And thanked God 'cause life is a gift, but it ain't promised
So, I learn to appreciate life
I'm lucky to be alive, and thankful I'm able to sleep good at night
That sounds soft, huh?  It's like I'm trying to preach to you, right?
See, y'all people are blind, I'm just speaking my mind
Look, I don't go to church, but I believe in God
He's helped me through some real shit that's too personal to speak upon
See, us people only learn from stuff that we do wrong
Or when someone dies, and it hurts for us to see them gone
And then you try to cover your tracks
With stuff that you've done in the past
But you can't take none of it back
So, live life like it's your last day
'Cause sometimes just being alive's a reason to celebrate

[Chorus: Brandy Callahan + Snoop Dogg]
Not trying to say I lived perfectly
But I'm saying I do believe
That through ups and downs, don't help around
They keep trying to kick me down, but I have the answer
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
They can say what they want 'bout me (I don't care what they say about me)
I know who I'm destined to be
One day, they'll see (they're gonna see it)
They'll wish they could be
On the other side, and they'll wish they knew the answer
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?

[Verse 2: Pat Stay]
Couple friends passed, mad homies locked up
Just lost the love of my life, got my heart crushed
Everything spinning in circles, I feel lost, but
I changed my perspective on life, through God's trust
And all the things I used to be fascinated with
Now just make me sick, but the boys haven't changed a bit
Look, I'm still down, homie! I ain't acting like a bitch!
But I'm a grown man now: I just had to make a switch
I'm legit!  And trust me, it feels good!
Never been a thug, but I'm a legend in the hood
I seen my life flash in front of my eyes dozens of times
Type of shit that makes these average Joes run for they lives
So, you gotta make a decision
Change the way that you're livin' and pave the way for your children, or face your days out in prison
I ain't trippin'
Get in where you fit in, play your position
But I promise one day you'll be wishin' you had a listen

[Chorus: Brandy Callahan + Snoop Dogg]
Not trying to say I lived perfectly (not trying to say I'm perfect)
But I'm saying I do believe
That through ups and downs, don't help around
They keep trying to kick me down, but I have the answer
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
They can say what they want 'bout me (I don't care what they say about me)
I know who I'm destined to be (I know who I am)
One day, they'll see
They'll wish they could be
On the other side, and they'll wish they knew the answer
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?

[Verse 3: Pat Stay]
See, y'all don't expect this from me
Thought jail's where I was destined to be
In the pen, sentenced for catching a breach
But instead, my pen sentence is sending direct messages to kids who I look at, and see a reflection of me
'Cause God's given me the blessing to teach
This new generation's too hard-headed to reach
'Less you been in the same position, kids just ain't gonna listen
Like, "Who is you to be lecturing me?"
Look, I been there, done that, got mad respect in the streets
But fuck that!  Look, you don't wanna end up like me
'Cause every night I stress, wishing I'd have went for my dream
And became the star I never knew I had potential to be
I wasted so many years, drank so many beers
To overcome fears, just so it wouldn't show I was scared
I'm on my knees, God, please, console me through prayers
Just show me you're there, 'cause you're my only real homie that cares!
I'm going crazy!

[Chorus: Brandy Callahan + Snoop Dogg]
Not trying to say I lived perfectly (not trying to say I'm perfect)
But I'm saying I do believe (but I believe in you, Lord)
That through ups and downs, don't help around (they don't wanna help me, they're trying to push me around, yeah)
They keep trying to kick me down, but I have the answer
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
They can say what they want 'bout me (I don't care what they say about me)
I know who I'm destined to be (I know who I am)
One day, they'll see (they're gonna see it)
They'll wish they could be
On the other side, and they'll wish they knew the answer
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
(*scratching*)
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
(*scratching*)
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
