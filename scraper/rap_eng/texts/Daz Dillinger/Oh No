[Intro: Daz Dillinger]
Oh no! Murder, murder, murder...
Busting at these niggas who claim to be hard
Murder, murder, murder...

[Verse 1: Daz Dillinger]
Come and blast and Dat Nigga Daz will act rude
Coming through, murdering fools who claim to be hard
Pulling your motherfucker's hoe cards
Me, we're going back for you to say that
Prepare for battle, let the 9 rattle with pay back
Knowing where you motherfuckers rest and hang at
I'm in Long Beach, where the gangbangers hang at
Don't want no static, don't panic, we're packing cannons
Ain't asking for shit, nigga, cause we're blasting
See, we're The Gang, kicking dust to maintain
Bang on niggas for a living, busting on police and opponents
Be on 'em just for twelve figures
Money, dope, cars and bitches, to get me richer

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
Oh no, niggas just wanna get killed tonight
Tripping on you, the way I feel tonight
Niggas better pack you guns
Oh no, niggas just wanna get killed tonight
Tripping on you, the way I feel tonight
Niggas better pack you guns

[Verse 2: J-Money]
Glocks are popping off like turbo
Step into my circle, my word is out to serve yo shit
Money bust;s, is lyrically in motion
About to whip up a potion,, the East Side coastin'
I'm the one they love to hate with a passion
I packs a blue steel, filled with skilled raps, blastin
MC's get dealt with, my microphone's my third partner
Heat seeking like a missile when I drop ya
Style is proper, my execution-style of rapping
I'm packing a rap firing squad what's happening?
My mind is going deep, like Money mystical and all
You couldn't see me with a crystal ball, y'all
It's critical, I'm thinking of a masterplan
Come up out  your shit man, I'm broke, feeling critical conditions
Listen, Money's on a dirt mission
Creeping through the night, beanie tight, Armageddon

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
Oh no, niggas just wanna get killed tonight
Tripping on you, the way I feel tonight
Niggas better pack you guns
Oh no, niggas just wanna get killed tonight
Tripping on you, the way I feel tonight
Niggas better pack you guns

[Verse 3: Daz Dillinger]
Watch out, here I come
Battling motherfuckers till the break of dawn
Homeboy, ring the alarm
It's D-A to the Z, dropping the formula
And every nigga that I know in Californ-i-a
Dat Nigga Daz will come out and play
Busting on niggas with an AK
So any given day you want some
Come and get some, you don't want none
Why do we bang?
Why do we bang for a living? We just don't know
Now it's time to serve y'all bitch ass niggas on an open platter
Yeah, haha
Oh, what nigga, you don't think i'll lay your ass down?

[Verse 4: Tray Deee]
You see, I take the ultimatum, disregard the outcome
I'm hard to outrun, and won't be outdone
I hate fake, can't take away motherfuckers
I come up from the slums and I run, motherfuckers
No other than The Gang, is to slang and prosper
And bang as mobsters, while claming Oscars
While most niggas boast they control they coast
They be old and broke, cause they've been known to choke
Like Malone, be gone when the playoffs come
But I'ma stay off one, liable to spray off some
Ammunition, I handle missions one on one
Niggas, come on, come and get they gumbo done
I'm the Cannibal, the Hannibal Lector of rap
A nigga steps up wack, and gets a setup-tax
We're The Gang, and we're mash and blast to maintain
We done came in the game and things aim to change

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
Oh no, niggas just wanna get killed tonight
Tripping on you, the way I feel tonight
Niggas better pack you guns
Oh no, niggas just wanna get killed tonight
Tripping on you, the way I feel tonight
Niggas better pack you guns

[Outro: Daz Dillinger]
Oh no...
