[Verse 1: Kurupt]
All up in the shadows with Calicos and the 4
Dippin' in my low-low, I’m a muthafuckin' fool
G stands for Gangsta, first and foremost
Posted with pistols, holding my post
MC dippin' not giving a fuck
Kurupt slide, Daz roll, I’m shotgun in the ride
Like, "Nigga, did you see that muthafucka over there?"
The first muthafucka with his hood in the air
Round up the homies in the park
12-double-O afternoon, check the homie's heart, shit's about to spark
Thunderdome poppin' off
When you check a nigga's heart they start droppin' off
I'm a gangsta, a gangsta, a bitch is a bitch
Change up and switch, fuck around and then snitch
Walk, gangstas just walkin'
Talkin’ that gangsta talk with that gangsta walk
Count the homies off by the tens and rows of fives
If we call can get the fuck in, we ride
That’s how the gangstas move, I'm a G, I’m a fool
I'ma dip, I'ma trip if you want me to
I'ma ride, I’ma slide with the gangsta glide
I'm a gangsta, nigga, I'm a gangsta, nigga

[Chorus: Kurupt & Daz]
When you see me in street, best believe I got heat
I'm a gangsta, nigga; I'm a gangsta, nigga
On the grind, living life in the fast lane, muthafucka
I'm a gangsta, nigga; I'm a gangsta, nigga
Making money ain't a thing for a muthafuckin' gangsta, nigga
I'm a gangsta, nigga; I'm a gangsta, nigga
'Cause when you see me in the street, best believe I got heat
I'm a gangsta, nigga; we some gangsta niggas

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
You thought you had a grip? Well, we did too
That's why me and the homies decided to come through
Whip out the pistol, snatch off his head real quick
Bitch nigga, where the fuck did you stash the grip?
On some gangsta shit, 'cause gangstas make the world go 'round
Whip out the 4-pound, dump 'cause he's moving around
I bet he'll never move again
The next time a muthafucka say "Stay down on the ground"
I bet he won't make a sound
This is G-land, nigga, Thailand, nigga
Lullaby high, do or die land, nigga
Gangstas like 'fuck a bitch', hit the streets, hit a switch
Me and D-A-Z like 'Bitch, pay me'
That's how gangstas move, I'm a G, I'm a fool
I'ma dip, I'ma trip if you want me to
I'ma ride, I'ma slide with that gangsta glide
I'm a gangsta, nigga; I'm a gangsta, nigga

[Chorus: Kurupt & Daz]
When you see me in street, best believe I got heat
I'm a gangsta, nigga; I'm a gangsta, nigga
On the grind, living life in the fast lane, muthafucka
I'm a gangsta, nigga; I'm a gangsta, nigga
Making money ain't a thing for a muthafuckin' gangsta, nigga
I'm a gangsta, nigga; I'm a gangsta, nigga
'Cause when you see me in the street, best believe I got heat
I'm a gangsta, nigga; I'm a gangsta, nigga

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Have you ever once looked back, looked into the mirror
Saw yourself falling flat like "Where the fuck am I at?"
I'm sick of this shit, I'ma put it all on the line
Before Daz start slappin' bitches out they mind
Like "Bitch, you wanna get slapped out ya mind?"
Bitches, I'ma tell you one more time
See, we can do anything, pull any hoe
Do anything you wanna do, don't ya know?
Kurupt and Daz, Daz and Kurupt lick it up
I'ma Aqua Boogie with a bitch walking up and down the strip
Not giving a fuck, bitch, Daz droppin' gangsta shit
It's 9, let's high, the hoes need a 10
This is G-land, nigga, Thailand, nigga
Lullaby high, do or die land, nigga
Gangstas like 'fuck a bitch', hit the streets, smash a snitch
Me and D-A-Z G, 'Bitch, pay me'
That's how gangstas move, I'm a G, I'm a fool
I'ma dip, I'ma trip if you want me to
I'ma ride, I'ma slide with that gangsta glide
I'm a gangsta, nigga; I'm a gangsta, nigga

[Chorus: Kurupt & Daz]
When you see me in street, best believe I got heat
I'm a gangsta, nigga; I'm a gangsta, nigga
On the grind, living life in the fast lane, muthafucka
I'm a gangsta, nigga; I'm a gangsta, nigga
See me, it ain't a thing for a muthafuckin' gangsta, nigga
Daz a gangsta, nigga; Daz a gangsta, nigga
'Cause when you see me in the street, best believe I got heat
I'm a gangsta, nigga; I'm a gangsta, nigga; I'm a gangsta, nigga

[Outro: Kurupt & Daz]
What about you? What about her?
What about him? What about him?
I'm a gangsta, nigga
What about you? What about her?
What about him? What about him?
You got your shit?
Come on, let's go out and touch these niggas again, muthafuckas
