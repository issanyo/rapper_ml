[Intro: Daz]
Feels good, don't it?
Yeah
All my people in the hood
It's for you all

[Verse 1: Daz]
They say what's up homie? What's goin' down? We ain't see you in a minute
Doing for self, keep it independent
I'm back with new piece of dope rap
I clutched that loot in my hand, the grand I had to touch that
Clutched the ooze, I'm comin' with bad news
Hit [?] to expects, so I had two
Now it's sold up, money fold up swoled up
My dreams is about to blow up
You know my name, my hood, my game
I showed up with Jay-Z, you changed the game
Swinging my chain, when I perform lovin' the stage
And the fans loved the era we make
[?] I keep it up at the high of my peak
I keep it gangsta for the thug street
They two up and grew up on this Dogg Pound shit
With that appreciation I just can't quit
You know

[Chorus: & Daz]
Y'all can say (Y'all can say what y'all want)
What y'all want
'Cause I ain't gon' leave (I ain't gon' leave these streets)
Leave these streets (okay everyday)
'Cause I got love in (I got love)
In these streets (all over in these streets)
And I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gon' stop for you, nobody)

[Verse 2]
If it wasn't for the Lord, I'll be dead or in prison
Many day set prayin' that the Lord I'm still livin'
The other day my little homie ask me" Daz, how does it feel
To be one of the realest niggas that keep it real"
I said to myself that we all need help
We play the cards that was dealt and that just how I felt
I don't hang with suckers, punk motherfuckers
Mark ass bastards, who starting that bullshit
I go [?] blessed to have wealth
Every morning that I wake up, thank the Lord for my health
The rest of my Dogg fam the [?]
Roam in and zone in the streets, niggas are you feelin' it?
[?], I carry a Four Five heat
The cliff steep, pay attention and peep
Keep lookin' and you'll find what you look for
The decision is yours oh, you know

[Chorus: & Daz]
Y'all can say (Y'all can still say)
What y'all want (what the fuck y'all want)
'Cause I ain't gon' leave (I ain't gon' leave these motherfuckin' streets)
Leave these streets (You know I mean?)
'Cause I got love (I got love fool)
In these streets (In these streets)
And I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gon' stop fool, you know I mean? Hey!)

[Verse 3: Daz]
I got love for these streets, and these blocks I grew up on
Teachin' me right from wrong, my pops set my minds
I search for all enough to find a new time
To bust rhymes, nigga instead of doing crime
The time is now, and here's the chance to take it
I take it and make it
My motive "fuck what they say, keep it crackin'"
Never said I wouldn't, always said that I would
Never said that I couldn't, always said that I could
You'll be actin' Hollywood, I act Hollyhood
Homie tell me it's all good
Yeah, I'm on top of the world, with niggas with perms
And we gettin' heff from your girl haha

[Chorus: & Daz]
Y'all can say (Y'all can still say)
What y'all want (what the fuck y'all want)
'Cause I ain't gon' leave (I ain't gon' leave shit)
Leave these streets (Can't leave these streets)
'Cause I got love (I got love)
In these streets (Yeah in the streets)
And I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gon' stop for nomotherfuckin'body)

[Chorus]
Y'all can say
What y'all want (What y'all want)
'Cause I ain't gon' leave (I ain't gon' leave)
Leave these streets (Can't leave these streets)

'Cause I got love
In these streets
And I ain't gon' stop

[Collision: Daz]

All my real [?] niggas just die for these streets
Throw your hand up, c'mon, bounce with me
All my real [?] niggas just die for these streets, c'mon
Throw your hand up, c'mon, bounce with me
