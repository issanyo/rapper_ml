[Hook 1:Shambased]
Oh baby
I'd like
To show you my city
Maybe we'll get tipsy
Won't you come on with me
Won't you come on with me
Yes, friends can come too
Just tell them to come through
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

[Verse 1: Knowledge]
They say the blacker the berry baby
The sweeter the juice
So when our worlds collide, let it be the living proof
Sometimes I paint a vivid image of a young G in the cut
Trynna flex for all these women
Ayo baby wassup?
Heard you flew from outta town, need a night on the town?
I know some spots where we can kick it
If you dig it
Then let's whip it
But I gotta admit
I'm kinda sketch about ya
Why you so quiet girl
Come on let's socialize
And let me touch up on them thighs
And bring you close to see them eyes
Dr.Funkenstein with the rhymes
For a dime
The suns settin'
And I think it's just another blessin'
Havin' you out tonight
Dark skin
Wassup then?
What you trynna get into?
No blues clues
Whenever I works with you
Bear witness, now I got you in my scope

(Pac)
I taking off my coat
Clearing my throat

[Hook 2: Shambased]
Oh baby, I'd like to
Show you my city
Maybe we'll get tipsy
Won't you come on with me
Yes, your friends can come too
Tell em to just come through
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

[Verse 2: Knowledge]
Baby you telling me different things
I'm picking up different signals
From different signs
Maybe I'm blind to what you really want
Cause what I really want is in them denim jeans
Or so it seems, baby girl
Once I had a dream like Dr.King
Except it was only me and you
Like
Under the full moon
The sky a purplish blue
Like we was crippin' the night
Baby, I'm Superman
And you are my Kryptonite
Imma fight, like knight
Cause want you
Ain't no playing involved
Lemme call, to come and scoop you
Up from ya palace my princess
Witness this passion that I'm inflictin'
Keep the woes flippin'
Double dippin' in ya body
Like I'm off the diving board
To let you go
Is somethin' that I just cannot afford
So lemme know wassup
My ride about to pull
And I got my mind made up
So

[Hook 3: Shambased]
Oh baby, I'd like to
To show you my city
Maybe we'll get tipsy
Won't you come on with me
Won't you come on with me
Yes, your friends can come too
Just tell em to come through
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up
