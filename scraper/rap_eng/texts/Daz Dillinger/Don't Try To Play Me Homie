Yeah, youknowhatI'msayin'. Motherfuckders in the world tryin' to play niggas out these days. Can't fuck around and play no niggas out. These days, niggas is smarter'n a motherfucker, man. We gotta make cash. Only thing that's ruling this motherfucker right now, this strap, this weed, and this money I got in my pocket. Finna go get mo' money. youknowhatI'msayin'. Ha, fuck 'em

I hear some niggas comin' 'round
Talkin' 'bout what the fuck they can do
But the only thing I do is
Realizin' in my crew
Fuck these snitches
Fuck these bitches
Ain't worth the jail time, bro
You know these streets is a motherfuckin' joke
And that's the way it goes
Playa playa got caught up
Brought up the wrong way
But he say the white man
Fucked me up and got me acting that way
You know the homey who be
Ballin' with the squad (squad)
Little Y.G. tryin' t'practice acting hard
Talkin' 'bout money, talkin' 'bout bitches
Talkin' 'bout fancy cars and all that shit
Cocaine a pound of weed
And bitches sucking on his dick
He used to win it to live that way
Ever since them Chronic days
The big homeboy C-style put him on
Nineteenth Street got him on his way
It was cool 'cause he was finally one of us
Someone we can trust later on
Someone we couldn't trust
Niggas got greedy, seen us clockin' dough
In this rap game threaten to snitch
If he wasn't rich in a matter of days
Should we kill him or let him starve? (kill him)
Make him get real broke (kill him)
Hell, naw, this nigga gotta die right here
We ain't no joke (hell yeah, nigga)

8:30 in this evenin', I cop the sack gettin' me set
Get some Orange getting me on my mind state just at rest
Cruise the neighborhood proudly, and I'm throwin' up my set
Dogg Pound Gangsta homeboy and don't you forget
I crack a forty of that Eight fuck St. Ides I love the taste
And my system bumpin' down the street with nothin' but bass
And the homeboys flossin', we tossin' up the scene
Lookin' clean as fuck, makin' green
Mashing as a motherfuckin' team
It seems the homies notice me, who I am
Goddamn tires hoppin', pullin' up pop on the jam
Niggas started hoping, showin' stereo on three chromes
And the situation just went so fast
Daz Dilinger kickin' ass
Steadily movin', making cash
Later on, I bounce to the club
Me and my cousin Rico Snoop
Tai cousin Supafly, Big Style, E and Hershey, too
Cruisin' up ? like fools don't understand my thing
Come around here, homeboy, and you won't see daylight ever again
Come tow me, bitch, come get me rich
You know my way my game we spit

Told ya what, told ya twice
Told ya why, told ya somethin'
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party bumpin'
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party bumpin' [Snoop over last line]
Dumpin' on niggas after the club
