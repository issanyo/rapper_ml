[Verse 1: Bugzy Malone]
Give this mad black man a CAT scan
And watch the world marvel at the sight of his divine mind;
Nigga this is primetime rhymin'
I like to treat the game like it's COD
I tote these accurate verses, and they burst like a FAMAS
Me and my conglomerates
Steady droppin' dimes and gems
Pennies for the thoughts
Gettin' jotted with a diamond pen
Eat up all you rhymers
Hungry niggas in the struggle, but that's only for a season;
My team finna bubble, sendin' chills down spines like, "Who changed up the climate?"
Leave a rookie pussy bleedin'
Like a torn up hymen
Yeah
Tell 'em who the culprit is
Nah, we ain't anonymous:
CB, we be, CT's finest
My blue blood is cold, nigga fuck your coast
I'll scrape all these weak cats like some burnt up toast
Give me all my dividends, i want money to blow
Run the jewels mother fucker, what you need those for?
These Bristol kids is ignorant, spendin' cash on blow
Fuckin' idiots, thats on you
But when you do a bump, bump my shit
And when you do a line, recite mine;
I go hand in hand with coke cause I'm dope
Throw froze speedballs at retards
I keep on tellin' y'all I'm frigid
I guess you dont get it
Bitch, I been a menace since Denis was just an infant
Bug a villain with an infinite stash of wicked rhythms, nigga

[Verse 2: Ryan Jones]
Uh
Ridin' around with the underground, niggas lie around
Yo, look who's chillin'?
Nigga, I ain't been nothin' different
Same nigga with ambition to be livin' with the Hiltons
20-13, the team been doing things; it was business
All on a mission with commitment
OOH
Kill 'em, cause I'm chillin' so vigor, with a gold digger
Thinkin' i'mma be a globe drifter
Rock-this-fu-ckin-house...
Cold Blooded; get wild
Peace sign in the air, tell 'em if we care;
Good vibes is the style over here
So, they label me an influence to the clueless and ruined
Ryan Jones be the name
Passin' like students
Cold Blooded logo on a global trip
On a pogo stick to the top
Takin' over; Mojo Jojo shit
Bugsy Malone just phoned home; now we gold
860 is you ain't know
So i'mma a mogul in the making
Braces on my face, and I'm still gettin' play
I been matin' with some females on the way
I been single for a day
I been sinnin' by the minute;
Definition of a penny out to get it
I'm the urge runnin' to be worth somethin'
Walk around like I'm Earth's coming
20-14, CB got the work coming

[Verse 3: jg.]
Ayo
Mr. Benjamin Button back to
Reverse time through the rapture
Still flying on Kybalion to capture
Transformative energy
Mutating mental capacity of the centerpiece
Of what is meant to be
Yo
I find self advocation within knowledge
Of one's individuality throughout the silence
That's why I leave the imagination to sort that
And let the ink paint you pictures like Rorschach;
At the end the margin, between consciousness
Sometimes I slip up off of the page
Into abolishment of realism
And steer in it a bit darker
I'm lost;
Goin' off right at the snap of the marker
I get into the ring
Not where the hand in the altar sits
But where I battle with the human in the mirror's alternate;
Myself
And through this life, most people who still quote-unquote "alive," have already died;
LET THAT MARINATE
Mentally and physically
The fact I'm here today's the reason that I'm still on the mission to find clarity
Felt like God had stopped hearin me
Figured the faith lied here in me
And discovered a Cold Blooded synchronization
From the womb 'til the tomb
Rhymin' and truth
Lowkey, I'm Earl Manigault developing in time
Til' then
I'm just waitin' to find the Elements of I
Stay + my nigga

[Verse 4: Julian Rose]
My rap shit is too legit to quit
I can go hit for hit, which means spit for spit
You like Kim K, your purpose does not exist
All you do is suck dick of these niggas that are rich
But I'm good
Truly I stay blessed
With the talent I've been given there's never a contest
Stretch and you will reach
Listen I might teach, reminisce Eric B., Rakim and simple beats
I been elite since cleats and All-State
Been a while since I thought life was all great
Life with no art is stop with no start
Play with no park
What's light with no dark?
Check this
I'mma wreck this reckless
Bringing back hip-hop without the gold necklace
Years ahead of me, you better respect it
CB representative recently re-elected
Did I forget to mention?
Since I was in detention
I been on tracks venting for your comprehension
Furthermore, look at what I've got in store
I could probably write a book of all the shit I can't ignore
I could probably write a book of all the shit I can't afford
Look at what I put together
Look at where I was before, uh
Shy to confident
So dominant
Youngin' competent, living the fullest
Motherfuck the consequence
And that's common sense

[Verse 5: RoSean]
Uh
Under rate me, you niggas still under rate me?
That shit is crazy, I've seen LeBron in me lately
I've seen
Mr. Smooth, "Take your bitch to prom with me" lately
I mean
The game is mine
Click a button, watch us in HD
I'm a motherfucking monster; check me if you want to
Step back, Off glass, or all cash; Bitch I'm ballin'
And you ain't givin' ass
So where your friend at? Quit the stallin'
Man, I get up in that pussy
I swear I'm reconstructing organs
And I don't give a fuck about opinions and shit
That's probably cause I view you niggas as minions and shit
You niggas cuffin' girls who took a million of dicks
And I don't got to be the shooter, I'll pay my mans, and you hit
Now
Let's address a couple rumors while I'm soundin' off;
I do get way too high, like I live on Mars
I don't fuck with fuck niggas, man it's like a clause
And everything I touch is perfect
Nigga I don't like no flaws
I'm perfect
Y'all niggas is losers, I'm here
Chasin' these dreams that can get ended by shooters
I'm talkin' extenders on rugers;
Niggas pretendin' to be what they not
And everybody ran they mouth to the cops
And everybody on the block 'til they not on the block
And everybody wanna get shot 'til they really get shot, but I'm
Just chillin'
Rollin' my weed
These niggas is on my dick like they bitches be
And I'm just chillin'
Chillin' chillin'
Ch-chillin' chillin'
I'm just chillin'
Chillin' chillin'
Cold Blooded bitch

[Verse 6: CBx1]
Yo, yo
I told you I'm that nigga, and y'all thought that I was kiddin'?
Rollin' in the Dodge with bitches that def' be wit' it
When I'm not in CT, I feel like I'm missin' minutes with my brothers
A.k.a the Cold Blooded fuckin' senate
In my dreams, back then, there was all of these glitches
Now I see me backstage, finger poppin' these bitches
While I'm on the road to glory, tryna chase these riches
Got distracted from these women, cause all they want are my dig-its
Niggas
Better respect the clique
Tearin' up your city, witness me not givin' shits
I'mma be a legend
Breathing legend as I spit
When they hear the name Malique, whole cypher right on this dick
Uh, yo
See there's really nothin' new
Niggas killin' niggas, and crackers killin' 'em too
My boy's people witnessed a nigga killin' for shoes;
All I'm tryna' say is I don't want my name on the news
Cause that shit is really killin'
But I'm livin', livin', livin'
In the Empire State
Where niggas cookin' in the kitchen
Cause this college life is crazy, I'm goin' slower when I'm sippin'
But I'm always on my grind, and hittin' what these niggas pitchin'
Cause I overcome adversity
Crackers callin' me nigga
But they stand in accolade when this nigga reaches 6 figures
So, I'm yellin' to the top, to please get off my Snicker
I'm a Cold Blooded nigga, got bitches bouncin' like Tigger

[Verse 7: Daz]
I be the illest protagonist
So watch who you rappin' with
Spittin' crack, and you niggas barely be baggin it'
I ain't havin' it with that inadequate faggot shit
My nigga, I'm top shelf like two cups in a kitchen cabinet
Cold Blooded advocate, lyrical activist
School of hard knock graduate, burn 'em like acetate
I'm on my 2Pac, Killuminati shit
Hit your bitch with the tsunami dick
Make her holla' quick, that's what it is nigga
I don't give a fuck, like a Jonas Brother's purity ring
On the finger of a pornstar filming a Brazzers scene
Eatin' collard greens
Poppin' ketamine
Laced with poppy seeds, all in the back of their grandfather's SUV
Nigga
I'm gon' get it even if my life depended on it
Flow stupid, retarded
I'mma grind, and that's regardless
Of what you say
I want to rise to be a legend
Like Dr. Dre
A couple grams in my backwoods to keep me refined
I said this game is a bitch
So I'mma fuck it from behind, and you know that I'mma wish it well
And if I die, I'll be the flyest nigga in hell
I take the purple kush, and then I inhale
Exhale, I will prevail
Dictatin' this shit like my name is Fidel
Castro, yeah
I said my Cold Blooded niggas, yeah we out here
Y'all should chill the fuck out, cause nigga this is our year
Yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 8: Tequila Yuen]
I'm over 9000, go check Vegeta's scouter
My carbon footprint shrunk ever since me & your bitch started sharing showers
I'm only kinda sober, rap game Jaffe Joffer
Chillin in your barbershop, bitch clean up all these flowers
Polly wanna cracker, hottie wanna cock
The shit & the urine like a "Johnny on the Spot"
Tequila motherfucker, licking shotties off your broad
In the school, bumping "Lotus & The Jondy" on the quad
The bass kicks in like a hit of the glass dick
This shit is a classic like strep's going around school
3rd eye open, I don't fuck with Chiaotzu's
You little clown dudes are headed for self destruction
I'm watching DBZ smoking DMT just to get a buzz
Y'all need to create some better drugs
I channel Heisenberg, writing words, never sus
The God-Body's potent, my nigga, I'm selling blood
I'm awesome, you missed me with the bullshit
You're a terrible marksman, I'll rock your skull as a chain like Dhalsim
Leave a nigga stretched out so insane
Well known for the art in these parts like Corey Pane
Been doing this since mom used to sprinkle my tongue with cayenne pepper
We on the grind like we ride for Zephyr
You light as feathers, suck a dick for 2 zip 1 4
Cold Blooded motherfucker, til it's done for
