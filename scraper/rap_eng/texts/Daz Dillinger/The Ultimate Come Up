Yeah, what's up nigga?
Turn it down nigga, what's going on over there, nigga?
Damn, that looks like the homeboy (what?)
That nigga's grabbing!
Oh shit, there's probably some crazy shit going down in the hood
Fuck what these niggas are doing, get that thing man!
What's up nigga? That's my spot, I'm taking over the spot
*gunshot* Lay down nigga, Watch out!
I'mma tie these niggas up, Bad A$$ on the ride nigga, that's right
Funny ass niggas, yeah, uh huh. Bitch ass niggas

Daz:
I see my niggas on the corner to the 25 deep
All hustlers, all killers, all raised in the street
Make sure my heat is in my stash spot
Gotta watch for my homies and feening for my stacks of rocks
Watch out for these shells and undercovers (why?)
They're out to get a motherfucker
Stop this gangbanging and cocaine, it's some motherfuckers
Niggas run up if you want two and watch you get floored
Get my pistol because I just can't take no more
I get the gun and then get to running, just like bitches
Bail out before the cops come, I can't go to prison
Still dealing and wheeling, on the curb I smoke earth
Hitting California, nigga, cause you heard the word
It's going down, enemy alert so get your weapon
Blast three people, step and gunning for more and keep on bailing (say
What?)

Get down, get in, get up
Get your money it's the ultimate come up (that's right)
It's slanging and banging upon my corner
Fuck around with this and you might be a goner (yeah)

Get down, get in, get up
Get your money it's the ultimate come up (that's right)
It's slanging and banging upon my corner
Try to sell your dope and you might be a goner

Bad A$$:
I don't fuck with no beats that don't bump, so sounds echo
Let you stand in my shoes, I loose, so I don't let go
Check yo bitch, not the pimp, niggas gained and slipped
Way below the smarts and just free slaves if you'se a mark
Might be mad, but nigga, just be hate
And let the heaven send riders ride, because it's the end
Beg forgiveness for all your sins, and hope he lets us in
Until then, live your life to fullest man, get your issues
Snatch money, catch money, attach the money
Keep 'em with your fishes, riches
Laying up with bitches holds a nigga back
Greedy assholes only wanna hold a nigga's stack
You'll fall, sure, bounce back, hit a jack, get a sack
Told the corner I used to work on "I'm back"
For you can slang out your sack, and get away and feel right
Black and white, crack down them sirens and lights...

Daz:
But all night we get down, get in, get up
Get your money it's the ultimate come up
It's slanging and banging upon my corner
Fuck around with this and you might be a goner, nigga

Get down, get in, get up
Get your money it's the ultimate come up
It's slanging and banging upon my corner
Wear the wrong type of colors and you might be a goner, nigga

MC Eiht:
Get in where I fit in, like Too $hort
Dip in, in a (???) Six Black Supersport
Automatic nines I took, Colombian neck tie
Whatever's the death threat, it's still do or die
Don't ask why, sipping on (???)
For Christie, you catching the blues like Misty
Me and my nigga Daz for the cash to any degree
Chase to, not the molester, the one who gets the cheese
Got it coming from oversees
Blunt your whole neighborhood, so nigga please
Better be nervous cause my finger's ready to squeeze, and that's no joke
Gang of cash in my stash, with bitches to poke
No one can do it better (no one can do it better), haha
Your chest is getting wetter (your chest is getting wetter)
I be the piper, run all the reps out of town
The spot's taking over, click click, nice to know ya (for sure)

Daz:
We get down, get in, get up
Get your money, nigga, the ultimate come up (yeah)
It's slanging and banging upon my corner
Fuck around with this and you might be a goner, nigga

Get down, get in, get up
Get your money, nigga, the ultimate come up (yeah)
It's slanging and banging upon my corner (right)
Fuck around with this and you might be a goner, nigga

Daz, Bad A$$, MC Eiht:
Chop it up nigga, yeah
Straight from the motherfucking streets of the ghetto (West Side)
If you're out there selling your shit (yeah), stand up
Get your rifle nigga, get your money nigga
Get your money nigga, lay low, lay low
Lay low nigga (that's right)
I gives a fuck, I don't give a fuck, let's ride
Yeah (West Side), I don't give a fuck
Yeah, we don't give a fuck
My nigga Daz in the house, Eiht in the house, yeah
