[Intro]

Yea, touchdown on this suckas man
From all angles of the game and let these fools know
We ridin, we mobbing, we hogging, we dogging, we flossing and balling

My best of friends try to mash me and do me again
What it iz, I thought we was down to end

My best of friends try to mash me and do me again
What it iz, I thought we was down to end

[Verse 1]
Forever coping cash, be on the mash with my business
Honest ticking yall niggas, niggas cross me got me acting shity
Real niggas is all that I keep
Keep watching the street making it happen with the rap and the beat
This the game and we bang on other gangs
That Don't play when we claim, so we knocks them out the frame
What a shame it is, can't be levels, can't be friends
Homies be acting funny we am swerve and an grin
But ain't no thang do you in
Grew up as an kid giving all I can give with one life to live
But with the Sean John give me con
From growing off of murder of mother fuckers, Bounty it's on
You know what time it is, drooping these rhymes again
Anyway it goes you niggas can't see my flow

[Chorus]
What it iz, I thought we was down to end
My best of friends try to mash me and do me again
What it iz, I thought we was down to end

What it iz, I thought we was down to end
My best of friends try to mash me and do me again
What it iz, I thought we was down to end

[Post-Chorus]
Why does niggas want to act funny with the money
We used to be down back in the day
Why does niggas want to act funny with the money

[Verse 2]
Roll up an blunt
Pulling and punching giving it up for nothing
Only in it for something if it ain't cheese fucking, Roll up biz a bucket
I keep niggas coming, so watch out before your punk ass get knocked out
Stuff one right back up in your mouth
Waking up early, im down so what you cha talking about
Im Daz Dillinger but im still dat nigga daz
Only in it just to get it just bust an niggas ass
Only demonstration, fuck conversation with us
Only conversation when we kick up dust
Its an must that I diss you niggas back again
Plus on your video talking all that smack

[Chorus]

My best of friends try to mash me and do me again
What it iz, I thought we was down to end

My best of friends try to mash me and do me again
What it iz, I thought we was down to end

[Verse 3]
Now my last verse
Showing up an few women
Im coming up and get bombed rushed
For running up Long Beach
Have you forgot where you from
Eastside of Long Beach represent 21
Blowing smoke in your face
Roll up an joint or bong
To set let your mother fucking ass to get out an song
Its strong to be weak, Watch out when I creep
And I land in yo ass to knock you out your feet
That pimp shit to impress me or faze me
All I fuck different yall and yall don't pay me
Simple as I can say I can say Fuck Yall
This is from all of my doggs so Fuck Yall

[Chorus]

My best of friends try to mash me and do me again
What it iz, I thought we was down to end

My best of friends try to mash me and do me again
What it iz, I thought we was down to end

[Post-Chorus]
Why does niggas want to act funny with the money
We used to be down back in the day
Why does niggas want to act funny with the money
We used to be down back in the day
