I’m shaking up the Lamborgini
Player never lose, but I always win
Put a couple stacks on it
Throw that money away like I don’t fucking own it
Keep her on that big stick
That’s the weed of my little kid
Niggers acting funny, but I’m knowing that they won’t trip
Don’t need no security, but my golden’s right in front of me
Pata-bang, who was that? Dance from the gold bounce
Chopper busting niggers pocking bullets fire, niggers down
Police take this all about, win that body, lay on the ground
Like told you niggers we don’t play that shit, we turn it up and down
Talking about a nigga, what you be about it?
You know you see a better nigga, you know we about a mask to the game play
Real fucking main name, you know I get that real fluid and you know how a nigga do it
I’m shutting down and came to get it
Yeah, I’m shutting down and came to get it
Again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again
I hear you little niggers talking
Early morning, late at night, girl, I’m sparkling
You know I do it for the fucking kill
And when I’m doing it, nigga, you know I keep it real
Live from the street, is the street news
Is the legendary nigga, yeah, I pay you
Strike your name out, yeah, how you niggers want it?
You fuck sucker ass nigga ain’t about nothing
Has some soldiers for you, go to war, go to war
‘cause me and my nigga we’re kicking on your front door
Hard in the motherfucking game, real G6
Bounce the ass, but the motherfucking niggers can’t kill me
When I’m rolling, yeah, I’m low kick
Well known in the city and they notice me
Keep a chopper on the back seat, seat
Automatically, I take it back, I fuck the street
I’m shutting down and came to get it
Yeah, I’m shutting down and came to get it
Again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again
Motherfucker, a real boy that grew up in the hood
Everyday you know we got it real good
All black, question on that black man
You know all that is, nigga, ‘cause it’s like that
Motherfucker, ain’t no speaker shit past me
Last of the other the three of the praise
Go hard on everything I do, keep it true, keep it blue
Nigga, running about you
DPGC for ella, ella, FI
DAZ, that’s me, don’t test me
Past on the rap, what you nigga fall down
Down, down, down, down, nigga, this is my town
Fast car, down, nigga, down, up up in the city
Sex, sex, showing motherfuckers here no pity
Second name up, better make your game up
If a nigga gangbang down, but you fucking clown
I’m shutting down and came to get it
Yeah, I’m shutting down and came to get it
Again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again
