Psssh, I didn't realize we'd be cashin in
Makin dollars, makin shit pop around here

Where my block? My everyday is a crime
A nine to five, slangin bucks, nine millimeters
Three-eighties and gauges and Glocks

And I watch the clock (hah!) watchin anybody and any
For every fuckin dime, every penny, what a pity
I'll be livin the city, livin greedy, lookin for (??)
Wit a spirit that'll jealous the belly, then now
Two wanted killers slang crack, shit
Smokin boodah's off that brown orange boodah
Stabbin motherfuckers in the back, I ain't afraid to do ya
Roll wit niggas, that's the same, or roll wit a gang
Roll up in a school and bang - bang!
And hang out, to sellin (?) struck out
Fiends, who's worries kept green, or stick the merry, dream
That could make 'em run and get the pistols, the shit
This ain't a damn thing funny (fool!)
Niggas around my block, start actin so crummy
When Atlanta dawgs reach that G status, just to have it
And anything that'll (?) out my jock just to have us
Hoppin down the steps, where my homeboys chill
Sippin hundred, had a bomb smoke that's real
I hate see the homies pass by, they creep inside
Lettin niggas know that this the C-SIIDE! (yeah)
