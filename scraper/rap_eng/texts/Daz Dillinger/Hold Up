What they tell me I’ll be dealing on these streets like a felon
Money stacked to the wall, gotta get it, get it, y’all
Blowing smoke in the air, counting money in my chair
Cutting checks for these bitches, ‘cause my pimping bring me bitches
Hold up, what the fuck
See, I don’t really give a fuck about your cut
My money stacked to the ceiling
You think about me, you think a million
Head out my name, homegirl, these trunks right here will stump you
I’m pissed on wipping motherfuckers, no time for discussions
I mind on my squriller, number one dealer
Catch me on my hood on some real shit, nigga
Hold up, what the fuck
See, I don’t really give a fuck about your cut
My money stacked to the ceiling
You think about me, you think a million
You see me in that Limbo, I’m bumping, cruising Bristol
Maseratti in the back, put my niggers in my hizo
He headed to the shizzles, pocket full of pesos
Lights, camera, action, ready, here we dizzle
Hold up, what the fuck
See, I don’t really give a fuck about your cut
My money stacked to the ceiling
You think about me, you think a million
Get your ass beat, nigga, when you’re talking that a lot
See you add a bat legal bitch, you asking me of that
Say you’re back in red, nigga, locked up, shot a dead rat
Now you’re fucked up on the side walk, this way you’ve been hooked up
Hold up, what the fuck
See, I don’t really give a fuck about your cut
My money stacked to the ceiling
You think about me, you think a billion
You know it’s all no sex
Nigga, take it high, give it
This money to be made, and you niggers bullshit
Now what they knew about my hundreds?
A bitch that stay blinded, a bitch, you stay strapped on and always done for the riding
Hold up, what the fuck
See, I don’t really give a fuck about your cut
My money stacked to the ceiling
You think about me, you think a billion
What they tell me I’ll be dealing on these streets like a felon
Money stacked to the wall, gotta get it, get it, y’all
Blowing smoke in the air, counting money in my chair
Cutting checks for these bitches, ‘cause my pimping bring me bitches
Hold up, what the fuck
See, I don’t really give a fuck about your cut
My money stacked to the ceiling
You think about me, you think a million
They see me balling, cracking down, it’s on the every day basis
I step up in the club and it’s about lot of cases
It’s the real nigga shit, you can feel it in my presence
And hear it a moment a bad bitch is pull out a car
Hold up, what the fuck
See, I don’t really give a fuck about your cut
My money stacked to the ceiling
You think about me, you think a billion
She got my DPGS ride up to the day that I expire
Say bitch, you’re a liar, put your pants on fire
Put it in the air, another sip to get me higher
Stop being scared, your bitch come try out
Hold up, what the fuck
See, I don’t really give a fuck about your cut
My money stacked to the ceiling
You think about me, you think a billion
I wear a thousand on my feet, two hundred on my wrist
I give these boys a kiss and tell ‘em you’re dismissed
Unless they push and prox they got a big, big, stick
They got money in the back, nigga, what you got?
Hold up, what the fuck
See, I don’t really give a fuck about your cut
My money stacked to the ceiling
You think about me, you think millions
This stone pound gangster
I’m silent like a movie
Cool cunt collective, every now I lose it
Told my hoes fuck em, no time for discussion
I’m all about my paper, I leave em in the dust
Hold up, what the fuck
See, I don’t really give a fuck about your cut
My money stacked to the ceiling
You think about me, you think a billion
What they tell me I’ll be dealing on these streets like a felon
Money stacked to the wall, gotta get it, get it, y’all
Blowing smoke in the air, counting money in my chair
Cutting checks for these bitches, ‘cause my pimping bring me bitches
Hold up, what the fuck
See, I don’t really give a fuck about your cut
My money stacked to the ceiling
You think about me, you think millions
