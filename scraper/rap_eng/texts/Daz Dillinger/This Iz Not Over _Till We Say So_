[Intro]
Throughout the city the gunfire lit up the street
We ride for revenge honor and respect
Death to all y'all homeboys
Catching niggas slipping, peeling there motherfucking caps back
Yeah, the game, that's how we do it
Everyday all day, straight riding
Fuck all y'all homeboys
(yo yo yo what's up)

[Verse 1]
I'm back, banging on niggas after trying to murder me
Caught in the middle of greed, witness to trickery
Now I'm here, ready to die, remember me
On a hunt for you bastards to put you out your misery
Made a more ? they die with bullet holes
44 explode that's when the story was told
My heart is as cold as the tundra
Automatic weapons warring like thunder
My final destiny is to put ya under
Come on warring whenever, me die, nigga never
Through the storm and the weather my dogs a go-getter
Polish da chrome barretta catching you punk niggas
That's the element of surprise you niggas won't regret us
Like shooting birds with pellets, let the streets reveal it
Do or die motherfuckers trying to kill it
Yes you can, and ever since we won't have no peace
Till one of us rest in peace, alive or deceased
It's your choice, your move, show and prove yo hand
Get it off yo chest let me know that you's a man
Get your pistols and niggas cuz it's about to get shitty
No remorse, no pity, you hear it all through the city

[Chorus]
Trickery and scandalous bitches
Niggas, that I fucked with
Wasn't no good from the jump
So now what we gon' do
We gon' ride
We gon' destroy, build, come anew
You know how we do
It's not over, 'til we say so
Nigga!

[Verse 2]
Word on the street is that you better have some heat
By your side
Caught your homie slippin', did he survive?
One to the head left him dead off the words that he said
Could have been avoided if he would have drove off instead
Nigga shot at my crib where my momma and kids live
No doubt, now it's time to take some more of you out
Scan the block with an inferred dot, just for a victim
There he go, there he was, there he go let's get him
My motto is no remorse and that you'll never surrender none
Only rely on your self and your gun
Biage, as I get high and look at the stars
Wish and wish and pray to God for our downfall
'Cause then it's back to the same thang, of this life I lead
Bitches, money, and niggas, and weed
Bust a left on one O feral with a double pump barrel
Be careful, cause these streets could sometimes leave ya narrow
With the faith of Moses, and the power of Pharoe
With the bullets hotter than fire and as swift as an arrow
Death becomes your every wish you try to blast me and miss
Now me and my dogs commence to get in your shit
You say the lord is your shepherd and you shall not walk
It's time to gaffle up these niggas stick 'em dead in the trunk
Behold the last words spoken by a dead man
It seems to realize niggas 'll never understand

[Chorus]
Trickery and scandalous bitches
Niggas, that I fucked with
Wasn't no good from the jump
So now what we gon' do
We gon' ride
We gon' destroy, build, come anew
You know how we do
It's not over, 'til we say so
Nigga!

[Outro]
Yeah, it's not over
When I die my children will grow, and smoke your ass
Starting our history book, Gangstaology
Throughout the streets we shall survive and live
