[Chorus: Soopafly + (Daz)]
My name is Soopafly (Pimp nigga)
And I don't give a fuck about no bitches out to get us
How the hell that sound?
(D-A-Z) Pimp nigga
(And I don't give a shit about nothin' but my grip)
And where you from? (Dogg Pound)
Yeah that's right
(And if a bitch can't swim then she bound to drown)

[Soopafly]
It's Soopa-doop in the coupe, game tight, regroup
Everybody want a piece of it but can't touch the least of it
I walk around pimp struttin' like the chief of shit
Gettin' rich but it ain't from no bitch
Now this heffer told me she had a bone to pick
I gave her just what she wanted, whipped out my dick
Said if you break it off make a wish, give it a kiss
Soopafly one funky nigga you can't miss
I crept off with a bad somethin', dick wantin', ass jumpin'
Pumpin' game, bullshittin', but it's all hittin'
I told him you can't give up the cat and get a kitten
It's just the game spittin'
I feel ashamed gettin' - ass so quick and fast, it hurts
Oh you wanna kick it?, question number one: do you work?
Wanna know why all the hoes call me Soopafly
Cause if my dick was a blunt bitch ya all be high

[Chorus: Soopafly + (Daz)]
Now later with the questions bitch, it's Soopafly (Pimp nigga)
And I don't give a fuck about no bitches out to get us
How the hell that sound?
(D-A-Z) Pimp nigga
(And I don't give a shit about nothin' but my grip)
And where you from? (Dogg Pound)
We some pimpin' ass niggas
(And we don't give a fuck about no bitches out to get us)
Now how the hell that sound?
We some rich ass niggas
(And we don't give a shit) About nothin' but our grip

[Daz Dillinger]
Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Soopafly
Feelin' good, gettin' bitches, gettin' high
See ain't no feelin' like this feelin' when you're ballin' and you're chillin'
In it just to win it, stackin' chips by the minute (ha ha, ha ha)
You know how my program flow
(Eenie, Meenie, Minie, Moe - man fuck these hoes)
I told you once, baby girl have no fear
Soopafly and Daz will hit you to Remy, coke, and beer
Steer to the left, met a rat named Michelle
Body of a goddess, face from hell
Laid in the cut, girls grabbin' ass and shakin' they rump
Baby did what she feel and did what she want
The party was in motion, drinkin' my act right potion
Ladies is posted, fellas on the wall
For all - my niggas and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
Because if you fuck, and if he fuck - we all finna fuck in here
It's goin' down 'til we drop
Every woman around don't stop, do what you be doin'
And every woman in the town, I'll break it down
You know how you want it, do that shit
Keep on what you doin', come baby, do that shit
I admit, you're hell of a... et cetera, et cetera
The more that dick you be blowin' the more you gets better
Whether or not you're dumb or blind
That motherfuckin' ass is mine, don't stop

[Chorus: Soopafly + (Daz)]

[Outro: Soopafly talking]
And that's for real, you know what I'm sayin'?
I don't give a fuck if you didn't have a house
If you was on the street... (bitch!)
Damnit, you ain't gettin' a penny from me
God damn, I swear, man...
I couldn't even be more serious than I am boy
I can't pay a ho shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
Did that ho help me play the keyboard?  (Fuck nah!)
Did that ho help me make this beat?     (Fuck nah!)
Did that ho help me write this rhyme?   (FUCK nah!)
No she didn't, therefore that equals zero, cero
Say it in French, Spanish, Russian - it all equals nothin'
That's what you get: nothin'  (nothin')
So remember my name Soopafly, remember nothin'
Cause that's what you're gettin' bitch  (nothin'!)
Nothin', I can't even say, nothin'
Shit... oh yeah, but this dick
Now that's for free  (beotch, beotch)
I don't know, sometimes I'll make a ho pay for that
I don't know, shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
This shit so great, like Tony the Tiger or some kinda shit  (GRRREAT!)
But it's all good, it's just some pimp shit
Me and my nigga Daz, you know what I'm sayin'
We just continue to put it down
Givin' a fuck about a bitch, and givin' a shit about a ho
(That's what I'm sayin')  It's like that
Keep it goin' baby  (gobble my nuts!)...
