[Verse I: Daz]
Turn up the bass break out the Vegas break out the cigars
I'm lettin all be known so you know who I are
That M-I double G-D-Ato the Z is the shit
I'm a gangsta and I'm only for the presidents
This is for you and yours I'm in the house fo' sho'
I say "Fuck it" you ready for the motherfuckin war
The D-O Double O-G don't even try to say (say what)
When you come up to speak don't even lie to me
You like to exaggerate dreamin of mansion
Make up the gang of shit that aggravates to hate me
So when you trippin and tryin to see (buck buck)
Or you be one of them niggas dead in the streets
Cause what I say is what I do that but only if they new that
They be dead wrong they can't do that style that I'm doin (what's that)
They might ruin (oh shit) paddle em down to the bass and start doin
Y'all all rain deep if anything heat seeing what that nigga wanna be
Everybody know its down (say what) on a serious tip
Punk you can get a smack from this nigga I ain't no joke

[Verse II: Luni Coleone]
You niggas betta get low its war time motherfucker
Its Luni Coleone I smash motherfucker
The life of a Westside rich nigga so leave that
Wake up with a can in my hand where the weed at?
These fake ass G's gettin tired of me
Cause I check em with no hesitation stay far from me
It's me and loud rude ohh I feel so evil
Drunk in the mo-mo sweatin hard off the E pill
Give me the mic nigga I'll show you how to rock shit
Shootin yo lights out like Houston Rockets
Diggidy Daz wuz up cause whats the dealy yo
Got shit locked from yo city to Sacramento
