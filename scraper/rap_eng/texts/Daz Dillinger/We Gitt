[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
We get high, we get drunk
We get loaded, we fucked up
We get high, we got blunts
We got money, we fucked up
We get high, we get drunk
We get loaded, we fucked up
We get high, we got blunts
We got money, we fucked up

[Verse 1]
[Kurupt]
Look, a couple words to describe myself
A pint of Henn I prescribe myself
Hit up the weed doc, run up in the weed spot
Hit up the weed doc, run up in the weed spot
Get me some purple haze in a jar and that aftershock
Get some purple haze in a jar and that aftershock
Cyanide hash, getting money with Daz
Sitting at the house counting mattresses full cash
Getting high

[Daz Dillinger]
I'm blowing big smoke, chillin’ with my kinfolk
6-6 Impala, nigga, ridin' on them 100 spokes
Windows up, AC off
You got weed, nigga? Uh, can it make me cough?
We smoking ounce for ounce, and pound for pound
You put it in my face and we gon' smoke it down
808 sub in your speaker, rollin’ heatseekers
Getting high, no lie, new colors be tweakin', C, C, C, C
I smoke and smoke, my homie Kurupt drank
He got bottles, nigga, see, I got the dank
Put 'em together, got a hella combination, we Tha Dogg Pound G's
(Daz and Kurupt, nigga, smoking and drinking)

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
We get high, we get drunk
We get loaded, we fucked up
We get high, we got blunts
We got money, we fucked up
We get high, we get drunk
We get loaded, we fucked up
We get high, we got blunts
We got money, we fucked up

[Verse 2]
[Kurupt]
Situated, finally made it, I got my game together
Not sedated or great it made it, the Pound forever
You wanna smoke with me? You wanna smoke with Diggy?
Daz rollerskating, smash you on the Hyp, the Henny
Damn, two hits and pass, that's that Amsterdam
Me and Daz roll and pass off that Amsterdam
We got it locked, we hit the spot off that Amsterdam
We getting all the money we can get off hash and grams
Getting money

[Daz Dillinger]
Get money, getting paid (getting paid)
You know Diggy do it a million different ways
I smoke ounces, in the Dirty
That purple kush, man,  it make your eyes blurry
You know the party don't start 'til I walk through the door
I got that indo, we got that kush and purple
We smoking Swishers, cigarillos, pounds big as a pillow
Here we go again, my nigga, roll up the window
We smoking blunt after blunt, going cup after cup
Kurupt, you know what? (Let's get fucked up)
Roll the windows down, smoke rushing out of the car
By the way we smoking, security know who we are, muthafucka

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
We get high, we get drunk
We get loaded, we fucked up
We get high, we got blunts
We got money, we fucked up
We get high, we get drunk
We get loaded, we fucked up
We get high, we got blunts
We got money, we fucked up

[Verse 3]
[Kurupt]
We stay smoking (smoking), drinking (drinking)
Making all the money we could make, nigga
We stay rollin’ (rollin’), ridin', slidin’
Dippin' through the speaker way we wanna dip, nigga
What the fuck? Who the fuck, wanna fuck, around with us?
Muthafucka on the smash, indo and hash
We'll whoop your ass, that quick and that fast
Kurupt and Daz, muthafucka

[Daz Dillinger]
Burning rubber in a 2006 B-E-N-Z, muthafucka, there's no other
Break it in with some smoke of the bomb
Hit the sunroof and I ain’t coming back 'til the break of dawn
I'm shining sun, walking on Cloud 9
I'm feeling good and everything is feeling real fine
Light or dark, all I do is spark up that shit
Tthat thing on your heart, they say 'Diggy don't quit'

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
We get high, we get drunk
We get loaded, we fucked up
We get high, we got blunts
We got money, we fucked up
We get high, we get drunk
We get loaded, we fucked up
We get high, we got blunts
We got money, we fucked up
