[Chorus: Men-Nefer]
'Cause I love it when you, I love it when you...
I love it when you, I love it when you
I love it when you, I love it when you...
I love it when you
I love it when you, I love it when you
I love it when you roll it up with the DPG

[Verse 1]
[Kurupt]
Every G got somebody on the side
That they spend their extra time with, get high and goodbye
She keep it G to  a T too
She love to bang with DPG too
That's why I'm fucking with you, little mama
Plus, I think your coochie squeeze tighter than an anaconda
She said she love me 'cause I'm funny
And like the fact the bitch got her own money

[Daz Dillinger]
Yeah, I seen her at the club chillin' with her homies
She got game, I got game, I'm no dummy
She insecure, I like 'em mature
See, I don't fall in love when I'm out on a tour
See, I give it just a little, she be itching for more
Plus she knows what a player really got in store
Big ballin', shot callin', big mall and all of y'all
And y'all keep runnin' off

[Chorus: Men-Nefer]
'Cause I love it when you say my name
I love it when you play them games
I love it when you make me work harder
I love it when you hold me, I love it when you tease me
I love it when you keep it real gangsta
I love it when you still be real with your woman
I love it when you hold me, I love it when you tease me
I love it when you roll it up with the DPG

[Verse 2]
[Kurupt]
I keeps it rollin' when I'm ridin' down the streets in my 64
Peepin' the ladies, ridin' on Vogues
Rollin' down the street to swoop Snoop
He got some bitches outside, got 'em washing his coupe
Phone ringing, it's the girl that I just met
Talking 'bout how she can't wait to see me again
So I'ma make sure I see her again
Again, I love the fact she got her own money to spend

[Daz Dillinger]
In a 500 SL Benz coupe she in
For the coochie, some spend, but we can be friends
Don't catch me now, baby girl, catch me later
In a mink or some alligators for all you haters
Draped from her wrist to her neck
I say that to remind y'all I'm one of the best, I'm so fresh
To the beat y'all, you know a high freq y'all
After the sun goes down, you know I'll see y'all

[Chorus: Men-Nefer]
'Cause I love it when you say my name
I love it when you play them games
I love it when you make me work harder
I love it when you hold me, I love it when you tease me
I love it when you keep it real gangsta
I love it when you still be real with your woman
I love it when you hold me, I love it when you tease me
I love it when you roll it up with the DPG

[Verse 3]
[Daz Dillinger]
Cruising the 101, catch us out in the sun, chillin' or having fun
Baby packing my fun, yeah, we number one
Blowing, big drank, swinging coupes and all that
You know, baby, a you know a nigga can't fall back

[Kurupt]
Tell me your sign, what's on your mind
You gonna tell me how I'm s'posed to feel inside
You got some game for me? I got some game for you
A thang or two to show you places I'ma take you to

[Daz]
Yeah, she know she fine and cute, she on the grind for loot
Baby she down to shoot, she get it real and speak the truth
Baby sweet as a fruit, I give it just to you
So what's a player 'posed to do?

[Kurupt]
I'm asking you, look...
DPGC, we just keep rolling down the coulevard
G'd as we wanna be, clean as a '63
Chevy on them gold thangs, candy painted Dayna Danes
Ain't a thang, watch us bang
Let me tell you how to get it

[Chorus: Men-Nefer]
'Cause I love it when you say my name
I love it when you play them games
I love it when you make me work harder
I love it when you hold me, I love it when you tease me
I love it when you keep it real gangsta
I love it when you still be real with your woman
I love it when you hold me, I love it when you tease me
I love it when you roll it up with the DPG

[Outro: Men-Nefer]
Dillinger and Young Gotti, Dogg Pound, DPGC
Yeah, oh oh, I love, I love, I love, yeah yeah yeah
Love it when you tease me, tease me, yeah yeah
