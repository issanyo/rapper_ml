Yeah, this 'bout that one man
You know tha one
The one you been through most shit with
One you don't fuck around, who came back home to

She was down with me way before
For what I've been through the mostly that I can't let go
She know just what to say to get a rise outta me
She know just what to say to get the lies outta me

She's the one, it's so hard for me to leave her
The one, I really feel like I need her
The one, ain't nobody else like she
And she lovin' nigga just for me, I'm talkin' about the one

She was my lover, my best friend, just like the homie
The only one in the world I could say that truly know me
Anythin' I desire my boost, she made it happin'
The back bone of my gangsterism that keep me balanced

With the paper at the game, broken up with some name
No matter what she would treat me the same
But I was wrong, I started to singin' another song
But she was weak minded, so grinded our love was gone

Fusin' and fightin'
Every morning 'til the break of dawn
Materialistic bullshit
That's what this is based on

All night she love me when I eat it up
We kick real hard and if a nigga don't beat it up
I'm down for you, you down for me like Bonny and Clyde
She showed the gangsterism when it's time to rock

She yellin' who gotcha back?
Nigga who gotcha back?
Just weather like little mama
She gangsta and I like that

She was down with me way before
For what I've been through the mostly that I can't let go
She know just what to say to get a rise outta me
She know just what to say to get the lies outta me

She's the one, it's so hard for me to leave her
The one, I really feel like I need her
The one, ain't nobody else like she
And she lovin' nigga just for me, I'm talkin' about the one

She's just as wild as she get, callin' the police
Threaten to take away my kids
That scammed the shit, that won't keep none of us stable
Our character mind is like the devil and angel

Our attitude is messed up, me and the motherly
The ghetto relationships that you go through as lovers
The wrong choice to begin with
Slam it on usin' profanities, tryin' get me locked up quick

Pushin' and shove in', fightin' and fusin'
Well, we made up like that, with a lotta kissin' and fuckin'
She forgave me, I forgave you, it's back like we were
Now I understand the meanin' of her

She was down with me way before
For what I've been through the mostly that I can't let go
She know just what to say to get a rise outta me
She know just what to say to get the lies outta me

She's the one, it's so hard for me to leave her
The one, I really feel like I need her
The one, ain't nobody else like she
And she lovin' nigga just for me, I'm talkin' about the one

T L to the L B C
Rappin' for the hood, real B I G
Every city we go we see the same old hoes
You're already slow, I got the one at home

Ridin', lovin' and would've smoke we eat good
Gotta be the one from the same hood
You know, hey, you know I can't let it go
Gotta be the one

She was down with me way before
For what I've been through the mostly that I can't let go
She know just what to say to get a rise outta me
She know just what to say to get the lies outta me

She's the one, it's so hard for me to leave her
The one, I really feel like I need her
The one and ain't nobody else like she
And she lovin' nigga just for me, I'm talkin' about the one

She was down with me way before
For what I've been through the mostly that I can't let go
She know just what to say to get a rise outta me
She know just what to say to get the lies outta me

She's the one, it's so hard for me to leave her
The one, I really feel like I need her
The one and ain't nobody else like she
And she lovin' nigga just for me, I'm talkin' about the one
