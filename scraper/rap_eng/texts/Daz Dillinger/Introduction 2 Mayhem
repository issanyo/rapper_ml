Now here's somethin' for the DJ's, keep it pumpin'
Real niggas from the street, throw up your heat
Pass it around to that down bitch that you fuck with
Stuck with it, hoo-ra, Soopa's the hoopla
In your hoopty, fly Gucci apparell
If niggas get you hot, get your flare on
He's a busta, nigga must of not seen the black pistol Glocks
You's a Columbian shuttle astronaut
Fuckin' with the "blast-a-lot" kid
I'ma shoot, pass the rock - SWISH
Niggas, throw up your fists like afro pick's
Up in this bitch, I'ma make you move
Grab my shit, layin' everything down
Stick up bitch, I hate ya, choose
I'm a real - Don, mackin' every way
I play, but then again I don't
I won't come up short, I'm tall
Look and then he ball
I'm Shag, I'll wax these fuckers and I'm back
C'mon, my squad thick like Redbones
What you doin' 'round here nigga?, I said gone
Get - the fuck out, back yo' ass up
Bitches - step up, back yo' ass up
The club rockin', I'm stalkin', chicken hawkin'
I pimp often, shit talk, grab my Glock and I'm straight
Hot like fire - propane
The way I touch and rush, you must have crushed ya
Just a cold saying - "no game, no fame"
Niggas mad, I flow dope like cocaine rivers
Fuck Santa Clause 'cause the hoe ain't in us
Label, check, pump, from pro's to beginner's
Dogghouse fuck your mouth
Half these niggas can show most of these hoes what suckin's about

[Chorus]
P-O-U-N-D
Niggas talk shit but ain't fuckin' with me
Soopa-fly, D-A-Z
Back in yo' ass, it's still D.P.G
C-R-I-P now
2003, we are the Pound
And then we shot that big ass gun
Take yo' shit, now you best ta run

[Daz Dillinger]
You know what we do when we step on tour
Kick a hole in the speaker, kick shit off on tour
I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta, all to the wanksta's
Bank ya, get you face to face
I ain't to intervene, me and my guillotine
Hang you by the string or the thorn, you've been warned
Get up and throw your hands up, stand up for the cause
No flaws, bangin' all y'all niggas on the cross
Crucified, do or die
You and your homie, it's you and I
Watch out for this homicide
Bitch - I'll leave you in a ditch
You and your fuckin' posse nigga - you ain't shit
I'll come in quick, I'll sink your battleship
Shoot 'em up, do 'em up, and then we outey bitch
Can I rock the M-I-C?
Or the phone, I'm prone, I'm know to get it on, HO!
I'm theatrical, your bitch is mack-able
I'll snatch your hoe, you know I got to battle more
It's time to build up my momentum
To society I'm a menace, I'm out on a mission
Your hoes we deep fishin'
We dishin' out the terror and mayhem
Pistol whip you and your man
I can't stand no pussy, soft, bitch ass nigga
You hang with me, nigga your pullin' some triggers
On yo' ass for the ten figures
Blow your back out to your liver and make you quiver, nigga
