[Daz]
Now as I'm rollin' with my niggas through the neighborhood
I don't like to dream about gettin' paid and feelin' good
I don't like to brag or boast, this West Coast to the utmost
(Daz and Kurupt kush'd out, blowin' on the best smoke)
Dippin' in the Magnum, Dat Nigga Daz smashin'
It's pimpin' on mine bitch, ain't no need for askin'
Tick-tock ya don't stop - I aim for the bullshit, ya don't quit
Top dolla, rollin' in my '6-6 Impala
Gangsta than a motherfucker, if you with it then holla
You wanna bang out? - we can do that too
You got a problem with me, I got a problem with you
You wanna solve 'em with me, nigga let's keep it all true
Or I'll bomb on you nigga, make it do what it do
I got my (?) on nice, ice cream blue
Got the iceciccles drippin' nigga, this what it do

[Hook]
You wanna roll with me, then let's roll
You wanna take a stroll with me, then let's stroll
You wanna crack a ho with me, then let's go
We can take her to the car, we can take her to the mo'
You wanna get high with me, let's get high
You wanna get inside with me, then let's ride
I got a AK-47 and a automatic nine
My mind's on my money and my money's on my mind

[Kurupt]
Daz, it's time to roll
Once we get the money then we in control
You know I keep it G from head to soul
I step up in the spot, each pocket's on bulge
I'm a gangsta to the fullest, D's and Vogues
Bitches keep on askin' Daz if J.D.'s at home
We got winners like Alicia Keys and in Vogue
This a Dogg Pound Gangsta affair in here nigga
I'm bout to have the spot engulfed in smoke
Talk a lot with no heart, finna get mopped into a part
I'm G'd, fly and flashy - I come in the party starts
I'm so sharp, bout to meet Daz at King Park
What it is fool?...
Have the baddest bitches skinny-dip in pools
It is what it is, it do what it do
Now don't talk to me if I don't talk to you
(Bitch!) Now this what you could do

[Hook]
You wanna roll with me, then let's roll
You wanna take a stroll with me, then let's stroll
You wanna crack a ho with me, then let's go
We can take her to the car, we can take her to the mo'
You wanna get high with me, let's get high
You wanna get inside with me, then let's ride
I got a AK-47 and a automatic nine
My mind's on my money and my money's on my mind

[Daz] (Kurupt)
You know we do it how we do it cause we doin' what we want
(Always keep it G'd and keep it G'd up in the streets)
We got that sticky-icky-icky nigga, won't you blaze a blunt
(And we smokin' in the back and we smokin' in the front)
Now throw your motherfuckin' sets in the air (Yeah, yeah)
Throw your motherfuckin' sets in the air (Yeah, yeah)

[Kurupt]
We keep it D.P.G.'d up, rollin' weed up
Kickin' back with both our feet up

[Daz]
And when we meet up you'll get beat as if you tried to cheat us
We them D.P.G.C. niggas in the flesh and you can't see us, see us

[Kurupt]
Six-deuce Chevro' motherfuckin 'lets nigga

[Daz]
So don't resist and let it go my nigga, don't fight that
(We don't love you hoes!) Bitch and it's like that

[Hook]
You wanna roll with me, then let's roll
You wanna take a stroll with me, then let's stroll
You wanna crack a ho with me, then let's go
We can take her to the car, we can take her to the mo'

You wanna get inside with me, then let's ride
I got a AK-47 and an automatic nine
My mind's on my money and my money's on my mind
