[ntro: Kurupt]
Yeah, uhh, uhh
Everybody grab their eggnog and Hennessy
Hahaha
(Merry Christmas)
(I wish I had love)
This goes out to all my homeboys out there locked down
(I wish I had love)
(I wish I had love)

[Verse 1]
Throughout my life as a child
My mama covered me with blessings
Thanking God over nothing
Bringin' love and the presents
But who cares about us homeless people?
God do (God do)
Don't be stingy, give a little 'cause He love you (He love you)
It's been a long time coming could say, for this day
Fulfilling dreams is the kid
For the Christmas that I never enjoyed a year
Spread love to my homeboys locked down in the pen
Spread love to my homies that passed that I won't see again
Enemies are friends, it's Christmas time let us join hands
Every woman, every man, across every land
What's the solution for your 9-7 resolution?
Is it love or hate, time's running out on the youth

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
I'm in the middle, in the rapture, in the mixture
Clear as daylight, it's painted clearer than a picture
I get my focus like a lens
I start visionin' all my friends, mansions and ends
Now when I was eighteen, it would seem
Thoughts of a teen wouldn't prevail but, I'm thinkin', oh well
That's life and I'm a be a G (that's right)
But for what I see the war's closer to me
Wanted to be what I be, have what I have
Write what I write with my pen and my pad
Ain't nobody want to take what I make (That's on me)
And don't nobody make what I make (That's on me)
.38 covered with the chrome plate (That's on me)
Realize, open your eyes, who's the real homies now?

[Chorus: Daz]
I wish I had love
I wish I had love
Growing up all alone, I wish I had love
Every Christmas without a gift, I wish I had love
I give love to all my homies, wish they had love
Every day upon on the block, I wish I had love
I wish I had love
I wish I had love
(Say what, say what)

[Verse 3: Daz]
Now as I lay myself to sleep at night
I pray the Lord my soul to keep so I can try to do right
There's no one else that I can turn to
I'm asking a favor, oh, just this once
Oh, Jesus Christ, Lord I'm asking you
Please help me out cause this my last days
Cause if I die today I'm going to hell and I'd lead the way
That I want to live my life, see
I'm having a few simple problems
And good one who could help me
I've done a lot of crazy things in my day
Being Mr. Scrooge on Christmas
Out there really trying to get paid
Now I know that was the wrong move
Please forgive me for my sins
And that's what I'm asking you
I read the bible to keep the tune of what you say
But this the first time in nineteen years that I ever prayed
To be straight up and be serious
I believe in you, God
My mom says you work miracles

[Verse 4: Kurupt]
I came from a small city called Philly
My cousin Brian just passed
The homie Kel-L just passed
Time's movin' too fast
I wonder will I last
Glory in the world with less drugs and cash
And I'm caught up
But this ain't the way I was brought up
Now I have doubts, what's that all about?
Now we smoke weed, now we get high
And I don't have answers when my momma asks why
(Why, why, why?)
Why do I do what I do when I
Feel kind of low and I'm on top of the sky
I'm my own enemy
With no energy to try
I stopped along the middle of the trail
Waiting to inhale and exhale instead of waiting to excel
Now, when I was eighteen
It would seem
Thoughts of a teen wouldn't prevail
But, I'm thinking, oh well


[Vamp: Daz]
I wish I had love
All the needy kids alive, wish they had love
All the kids with disease, wish they had love
To all the bums on my corner, wish they had love
To the whole worldwide, I wish we had love
Wish I had love
Wish I had love
And this goes out to the world, both sides
Death Row wants to say, "Merry Christmas"
And we out
('Tis the season to be jolly)
Dogg Pound Gangstas
Suge Knight, thanks for givin' Dogg Pound love
Death Row, thanks for givin' Dogg Pound love
Kurupt and Daz, Snoop Dogg, we be givin' love
Every day on the corner we be givin' love
All my homies in the corner we be giving love
Giving it up to all my homies , wish I had love
Every day and every night, I wish I had love
Thank God for shedding light on my life
I guess I have love
Christmas time
It's time for chillin', you know what I mean
Not killin'
So let's make it to see '98
And to all my homeboys in the pen (all the homies)
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
And we out
And we see you when you get out
