[Chorus]
It's gonna be a gangsta summer (Gangsta), and the gangsta live
That's when the gangsta shit drop summer get
(Summer-summer-summer time)
Gangsta summer, gangsta summer

[Verse 1]
I come through scrapin' the ground, shakin' the rout in the crowd
Gettin' wild, click click kapow out the cloud
Smoking and choking hard, for the beast Axilone
Dogg Pound gangstas, with the cowards gone
Eastsidaz, true indeed riders
When I'm all up on it, I'm on it just like a [?]
In Daz no one higher
I roll [?] spose wide lookin' sick when I will out
Get some drank and fuck some hoes and get billed out
You motherfuckers will love it when dig it ill out
I hit the city get gangsta now we all out
Myself lookin' for circle just coped his bird out
Hop in the Chevy motherfucka and I skirt out
You know it's DPGC for LA FV
Fuck with me and be R-I-P
Fuck with me and fuck with Five
And you get burned for lessons
For hard head motherfuckers who don't learn

[Chorus]
It's gonna be a gangsta summer (Gangsta), and the gangsta live
That's when the gangsta shit drop for summer it get
If you don't know, now you know homeboys will know
(Summer-summer-summer time)
You're just a gangsta summer, say what?
It's gonna be a gangsta summer (Gangsta), and the gangsta live
That's when the gangsta shit drop for summer it get
For those who don't know, now you know motherfuckers
(Summer-summer-summer time, summer time)
Gangsta summer, what? Gangsta summer

[Bridge]
We're just another sole day
Gangsta gangsta ville [?]
Take the [?]
I love that gangsta summer

[Chorus]
Gangsta summer (Gangsta), and the gangsta live
That's when the gangsta shit drop for summer it get
If you don't know, now you know homeboys will know
(Summer-summer-summer time)
You're just a gangsta summer, say what?
It's gonna be a gangsta summer (Gangsta), and the gangsta live
That's when the gangsta shit drop for summer it get
You know!
(Summer-summer-summer time, summer time)
Gangsta summer, gangsta summer

[Verse 2]
Gangsta bang to the boogie when I boogie bang
I boogie do my dance and gangsta boogie
With the gun in my hand
I take it back to '88, ridin' cuttin' the cake
2000 came make no mistakes
Sometimes like year in take and take in year
Livin' our gangsta shit, it just the life that I live
Puff and pass
Blast and runnin' from a gang task, the ski mask are gettin' gash
How did the cut is Diggy Daz

[Chorus]
Gangsta summer (Gangsta), and the gangsta live
That's when the gangsta shit drop for summer it get
If you don't know, now you know homeboys will know
(Summer-summer-summer time)
You're just a gangsta summer, say what?
It's gonna be a gangsta summer (Gangsta), and the gangsta live
That's when the gangsta shit drop for summer it get
If you don't know, now you know, you'll know that, that's a no, it's just
(Summer-summer-summer time, summer time)
Gangsta summer, say what?, gangsta summer

[Outro]
Yeah y'all know what time it is motherfucka
And it's on right now, right now
(In California), yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
The homie down
Yeah, ohh
(Cali cowboys), yeah
(Cali cowboys in California, yeah)
