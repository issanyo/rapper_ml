[Chorus: Daz & (Men-Nefer)]
(You remind me) You remind me of somebody I know
Somebody that I met on the low (oh yeah)
You remind me of somebody I know (oh yeah)
Somebody that I met on the low
(You remind me) You remind me of somebody I know
Somebody that I met on the low (oh yeah)
You remind me of somebody I know (oh yeah)
Somebody that I met on the low

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Is it the DP khakis all on crease? (Dogg Pound)
My candy painted hood Caprice?
Oh, you wanna set sail and ride
You're interested in the things I like?
Oh, you wanna see what I'm like
You look familiar, I think I remember
Back in September or was it November
She likes the way I"m G'd
And I like the fact that she likes the way I"m G'd
I'm like, 'baby, that's all I could be'
You know it's cool, baby, it's nothin', it's just me
She started rubbing my neck
(Is it going down, Kurupt?) Is fucking next?
Nah, I'm just joking, mama
I'ma bounce around, be soaking all your time up
She looked at me, she grinned, and then she said...

[Chorus: Daz & (Men-Nefer)]
(You remind me) You remind me of somebody I know
Somebody that I met on the low (oh yeah)
You remind me of somebody I know (oh yeah)
Somebody that I met on the low
(You remind me) You remind me of somebody I know
Somebody that I met on the low (oh yeah)
You remind me of somebody I know (oh yeah)
Somebody that I met on the low

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
I seen her before, white on white Diadoras
Looking gangsta, looking good, shooting dice on the floor
Eye to eye like she already knew
So you know I reminisce back to '92
I was young in the game, I was young into bangin'
I met her at a party where we swingin' and swayin' (ho, ho)
I toss some game at her
You married or single, divorced, it don't matter
I kick my conversation about my life and occupation
It ain't 'bout wasting no time when it comes to mine
I kick my illustration when I slow and wine and dine her
The freaky thing that you do kinda remind me
Intimate secrets, you'll fantasize (fantasize)
And now they get revealed, now you'll realize (you'll realize)
And baby girl I see it in your eyes
That heaven ain't hard to find

[Chorus: Daz & (Men-Nefer)]
(You remind me) You remind me of somebody I know
Somebody that I met on the low (oh yeah)
You remind me of somebody I know (oh yeah)
Somebody that I met on the low
(You remind me) You remind me of somebody I know
Somebody that I met on the low (oh yeah)
You remind me of somebody I know (oh yeah)
Somebody that I met on the low

[Verse 3]
[Daz]
You know I'm back up in your drawers, baby girl, that you're grown
And by the way you're looking I can't leave you alone
Perfume, cologne make us both wanna bone
You got your own crib now that your mama ain't home
You turn the lights off, I get you right, and let me feel if it's tight
Yeah, you're just my type, you do it all night
What's your name and your number and I start to wonder
Should I call you back tonight

[Kurupt]
Give me your name and your number and we can meet on the under
And I'll show you what I got on my mind
See, everything's bomb, I'm just one from the squad
But I'm still one of a kind, I got the world in my palm
I was at the spot posted where I buy my Cortez
This girl on the right looked at me and said, 'What's crackin', Kurupt?'
I told her I'm just posted
Then the one on the left took a step and told me, look...

[Chorus: Daz & (Men-Nefer)]
(You remind me) You remind me of somebody I know
Somebody that I met on the low (oh yeah)
You remind me of somebody I know (oh yeah)
Somebody that I met on the low
(You remind me) You remind me of somebody I know
Somebody that I met on the low (oh yeah)
You remind me of somebody I know (oh yeah)
Somebody that I met on the low

[Refrain: Daz]
You re-mind me...you re-mind me
You re-mind me...you re-mind me

[Outro over refrain: Daz]
Yeah, you remind me of my first one, you know'm'sayin'
You know, like when I first did it to a girl, you know
You remind me of Alicia Keys, you know, looking real good, girl
You keep doing your thing, I'ma do mine
I'll see you on the rebound, holla at'cha boy
