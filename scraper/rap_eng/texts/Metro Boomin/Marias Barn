[Hook]
No head over heels, just head over them hills
Where we reside might feel like teflon on your skin
Hennessy and pills, that Texas drank, we feel
Drowsy baby darling, I ain't got no time for problems
I'm busy being caught up between these quarter ounces of coca
Take em upper echelon, take 'em Satans spawn
In the hills, hills, hills ,hills far from Maria's barn

[Verse 1 ]
Busy being caught up between this quarter ounces of coca
Every dime per dollar, for prima donnas up in college
Grind for kilos, liable for trios, even when she re-up
Page her healer, refill her, another cinderella
Flocking a different color feather
All these tables, crowded with ice and vulcanos
Naked bodies to purchase coke and stuff her nose via primos
But as the devil she attract the righteous
Her act to interact and serve their vices
Atleast the white the she order
Birthed the life she wanted
Who knew? Fiends that life supportive
No more reckless scenes of demons haunting on her
As she vouches on the couches
In the house of pain for quarters
And her train of thought is distorted
Her 25 to life has been ordered

[Hook]
No head over heels, just head over them hills
Where we reside might feel like teflon on your skin
Hennessy and pills, that Texas drank, we feel
Drowsy baby darling, I ain't got no time for problems
Im busy being caught up between these quarter ounces of coca
Take em upper echelon, take em Satans spawn
In the hills, hills, hills, hills far from Maria's barn
(You know how to move,baby get me in that mood
Notch it up a bit, the strobes reveal what God forbid
Let me burn out pages, while you do your curtain raiser)
