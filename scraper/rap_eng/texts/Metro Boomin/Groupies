And my lil' one get head from a groupie
I dug all in that pussy, I got her
Once I pour in that Molly, I got her
Got my neck and wrist on the Phantom
We don't take them on dates, we just fuck 'em!
I appreciate the way you fuck me
We could never tell the fuckin' public
Pussy good enough to make me love you

But she gon' come fuck me whenever, whenever I want her
Take me a Xan and I levitate
I'll have her cummin' 'bout every day
Suckin' this dick on me every day
