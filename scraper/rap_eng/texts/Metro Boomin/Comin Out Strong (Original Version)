[Intro: Future]
How you pour that Sprite though?
If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, "Boy I think the money's startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, "Watch what they do for the ones"
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man, you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh yeah

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong

[Verse 2: Future]
I might end up with your ho if I take one
Nowdays if they don't have a story, they gon' make one
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one
I done end up on the blogs with the wrong one
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones
'Cause nowdays if they don't got it they'll make one
The times I get frustrated, I don't take one
I feel a hit comin', so I went and made one, oh yeah
They know my type of speed, they can't get no zs on me
They know they gotta be, I'm the shit, can't fall asleep on me
Dom PÃ©rignon, shake it up and spray it
We ain't nothin' but some champs and thoroughbreds
This cash flowin' 'till infinity
I been buyin' out the stores, living luxury
I can't forget about the swag champ, OGD
It ain't no competition, I got my mission secured
I gotta make 'em feel it, all the pain I endured

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong

[Verse 3: Future]
Pluto don't dance, but I make moves
We fucked around, now a nigga gotta shame you
Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too
Told me, "Boy I think the money startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
Ain't stopped by the rendered red lights in the Range coupe
I might shoot off in a Benz, and a Lamb too
I sent a few niggas frowning when I came through
Jealousy and greed, that's what it done came to
I got my proceeds, must've been an angel
I got a Cuban kilo on my fingers
I trapped my whole hood out, turned myself to a star
I'm on point now like I still duck from the law
They gettin' mad at us 'cause my niggas won't fall off
My niggas Cash keep the Actavis with him by the bar
I know they see me out in Aspen, they said it was luck
Be honest to me

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong

[Outro]
If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
