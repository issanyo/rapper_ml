[Hook]
Young Szuto why you shitting on haters
You used to be quiet hang with skaters

And now you snapping beats like a gator
Your music is the art and you the painter

Killing all these beets like a farmer (farmer, farmer, farmer)
These bars are so sick need a doctor (*cough *cough)

I type my own shit so I'm the author (I do)
I'm representing Zurci ain't no slaughter (naw)

[Verse]
Gotta go ham like my name is Seuss
I am the leader and you is caboose

I am so wild so don't let me loose
Feeling like chance cause I got the juice

Running through shit like sponsored Nike
You is so lame and I said that kindly

When Szuto's here your day turns brightly
Always so lit like my name is Mikey

Hating my ass like the ass of Kylie
Thinking it's fake cause the ass ain't widely

When I start rapping it sounds so wisely
Fuck all the haters cause the girls do like me

Finna slow down so I can breathe
I won't stop rapping even if you leave

I don't need you cause I got the team
Was that your breath or did she queef
