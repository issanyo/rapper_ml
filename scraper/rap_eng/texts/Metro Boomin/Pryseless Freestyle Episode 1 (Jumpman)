[Hook]
I'm jumping on that Jumpman Jumpman instrumental
I gat some doubts to clear, I got some scores to settle
'Bout to make these rappers bring it at a higher level
'Bout to save the hip-hop game, men I should get a medal

[Verse 1]
I need a car
I bet the Pryse Tag will raise the bar
I bet the Pryse Tag will raise alarm
I bet the Pryse Tag will birth a star
That wise men contemplate in awe
You say you want more I hope you're sure
'Cos me and my team don't pass the ball
And ain't nothing average at all
Go check the snaps, you know I'm up to something
If I ever stop the flow again, my stomach's popping
If I ever think I hear a shot, my gun is cocking
So choose your words wisely before I scrabble something

[Verse 2]
Every morning (w)rap bitches for breakfast
Red light booty, niggas see it, they brake fast
Nowadays them don dey know say I dope, men I don cast
The fans don dey blow me, my fire dey full blast
Shout out to that foolish blogger, I know you thought you were smarter
You strung some words together, for a few seconds you mattered
You said I was the worst, well clearly you could not be wronger
But I guess you're sorta right, my sister,  ain't nobody badder
I hope I'm right. I'm just assuming you're a bitch
I didn't come here to get in fights. I'll just as soon be getting rich
The revolution will be televised
Tell your loved ones to take a seat
And resistance is ill-advised
I don't want no civilians hit
