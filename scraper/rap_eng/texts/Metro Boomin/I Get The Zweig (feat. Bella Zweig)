[Intro: Lil Zweig]
Hah, it's Zweig
It's Jaguar (skrrt)
Wassup, hoo (skrrt)

[Chorus: Lil Zweig]
You get the Zweig and fumble it
I get the Zweig and flip it and tumble it (yeah)
Straight out the house, 80 bucks cash (cash)
And the house came with a Zweig in it (yeah)
Lil boy a thot, and he runs fast (thot)
And he won’t hang out with Zweig (yeah)
Pull up to the house, runnin’ too fast (yeah)
Droppin' the phone in the stash (yah)
In Italy, got two foreign Zweigs from Sicily (ooh, brr, ayy)
Hang with Josh when it's cold (drop top)
But you feel the heat (skrrt, yah, ayy)
Be real with me, you guys ain’t friends (whoa)
Just be real with me (ayy)
Eat it up like it's a Zweig (whoa, eat it up)
They say the Zweig on fleek (yep)

[Verse 1: Lil Zweig]
Map of Josh house on me (Map)
Ice on his neck, baby, chill with Zweeg (ice)
Them others that flex in the back don't say nothin'
Them Zweigs will kill for me
Hangouts I count 'em asleep, on fleek
100k spent to hangout and eat (eat)
Bitch, Zweig owns dogs, eat his treat (hrr)
Hop out the jaguar and leap (leap)
I sneak in the house like a Phantom
My Zweig, he walk around like Kris Jenner (Kris Jenner)
I like to break and then enter
Then run from the gun like a game of temple (whew)
It's simple, I play with Zweig mental
Josh said he saw me on Jimmy Kimmel(Josh)
Uruguay, 'cause I'm a Zweiggy symbol
Walkin' with the Zweigs, Cause I’m crippled (‘tism)
Go to the Zweigs then I tip her (tip her)
80 bucks for me to take pictures (80)
Josh claims that he didn’t kiss her (brr)
Double my cup, pour a triple (Water)
Zweig on my body, just kidding ya (jk)
I'm not your average or typical (I'm not your)
Look at my Zweig, and it's critical (look at Josh)
Shoot the ball, raisin’ the temperature (wet)
I get that Zweig on the regular (Zweig)
I got a Zweig on my cellular (brr)
Backin' up, Zweigin' up vegetables (Zweig)
Zweigin’ up cheesecakes, it's 20 bucks (cookies)
Joshy, Zweiggy, et cetera (Josh)
AP Human Geo, it's federal (maps)
I take off, landin' on Zweigula
As of now 20 hangouts on my schedule (Zweig)

[Chorus: Lil Zweig]
You get the Zweig and fumble it
I get the Zweig and flip it and tumble it (yeah)
Straight out the house, 80 bucks cash (cash)
And the house came with a Zweig in it (yeah)
Lil boy a thot, and he runs fast (thot)
And he ain’t gon hang out with Zweig (yeah)
Pull up to the house, runnin’ too fast (yeah)
Droppin' the phone in the stash (yah)

[Verse 2: Bella Zweig]
Yo what’s up it’s Bella Z
Representing the greatest family
My brother Josh is a G
I put on the song and I rap to the beat
I won't even come out the Jaguar for free
I pay a bitch to drive for me
Will Kohley couldn't even co-sign for me
I do what I want, 'cause I'm signed to ABP
I get the, I get the, I get the Zweig
They get the Zweig Zweig, have to cut it in half
Stop the comparin', y'all makin' me laugh
Hop in the jag, Drop the phone in the stash
Convertible Jag, convertible top
My jump got a vertical, look at me hop
Cop a Jaguar, Straight out the lot
Came out of Italy and went straight to the top
Take it easy, Zweiggy , middle of winter, I'm freezin', Zweiggy
Don't leave me, Zweiggy
Just buy me a Jaguar and please me, Zweiggy
I'm fascinated, me and Josh are luckily related
Congratulations, the school was so good that I graduated
Will had to hate it
I don't fuck with them Kohleys, they plastic, Zweiggy
A rapper, Zweiggy, I rap but I own all my masters, Zweiggy
It's tragic, Zweiggy , I pull up and cop a new Jaguar, Zweiggy
A savage, Zweiggy
I’m killin' these bitches, closed casket, baby

[Chorus: Lil Zweig]
You get the Zweig and fumble it
I get the Zweig and flip it and tumble it (yeah)
Straight out the house, 80 bucks cash (cash)
And the house came with a Zweig in it (yeah)
Lil boy a thot, and he runs fast (thot)
And he ain’t gon hang out with Zweig (yeah)
