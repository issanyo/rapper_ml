[Intro: PeeWee]
Pour him up Shawty make his ass go to sleep

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway & Young Thug]
He just ran into finessers, we don't juug
He just ran into finessers we don't juug
Ain't got time for that
Just ran into finessers we don't juug
Give it up
Just ran into finessers we don't juug
Give it up buddy
He just ran into finessers we don't juug
Ooh, ooh
I'ma finesse
I'ma finesse (let's get it)
I'ma finesse
Let me finesse (stay in that car)
Let me finesse (I'm on the way)
I'ma finesse
Can I finesse, (I'm otw) can I finesse
Let me finesse, I'm gon' finesse, I'm gon' finesse
I'm gon finesse 'em

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway & Young Thug]
Play with the weapon like I'm a veteran
I'll take your necklace I'll leave you neckless
Finessin' & flexin' you know that my profession
Look like a nigga that judge
I walk in Giuseppe
I'm drippin' I'm sweatin' I gave you lil niggas the fluid
Little Engine you wish that you could
Stunt you niggas like Sug'
All of my neighbors are hood
This not your neck of the woods

[Verse 2: Bricc Baby Shitro & Young Thug]
Two fingers Ferragamo hood
Another dot came with the juug
He say he want a hundred
I finessed his ass I ain't tryna' Juug
(Do what you wanna do)
I'ma buy a brick
Remix the brick
Fill it back up with Tylenol
Finessin' and flexin' got me spoiled
That's not Act that off
My plug keepin' [?] like karate
Say he got bricks of the molly
Finesse him like whoa kemosabe
Then I wrapped his ass up like a Masi

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway & Young Thug]
He just ran into finessers we don't juug
He just ran into finessers we don't juug
Ain't got time for that
Just ran into finessers we don't juug
Give it up
Just ran into finessers we don't juug
Give it up buddy
He just ran into finessers we don't juug
Ooh, ooh
I'ma finesse
I'ma finesse (let's get it)
I'ma finesse
Let me Finesse (stay in that car)
Let me Finesse (I'm on the way)
I'ma Finesse
Can I finesse, (I'm otw) can I finesse
Let me finesse, I'm gon' finesse, I'm gon' finesse
I'm gon finesse 'em

[Verse 3: Bricc Baby Shitro, Young Thug, & Peewee Longway]
Young nigga tryna jugg on me
I stung his ass just like a bumble bee
Left him on Bleveland where Thugger be
Fuckin' with crips leave you deceased
I punch at yo mouth if you [?] me
Young Thug and bone no harmony
I let them young boys piranha
Got your bitch make her say hondale
Still servin' every drop from A-Z
Papi whatever you callin' me
And you ain't get nun but them dummy b's
Actavis mixed with the Qualitest (Remix)
Take me a trip to the vault with it
Slam dunkin' just like [?]
He thought I had guala got hit with that choppa
Young Thugga and ? want all of it
[?]
Top shottas is back
Take the what lef' the what
Finesse and I Juug and I double right back
My Jugg house big as the dome
My neighbors like Moses Malone
Finessin' these bitches not home
Thugger don't pay back, no loans

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway & Young Thug]
He just ran into finessers we don't juug
He just ran into finessers we don't juug
Ain't got time for that
Just ran into finessers we don't juug
Give it up
Just ran into finessers we don't juug
Give it up buddy
He just ran into finessers we don't juug
Ooh, ooh
I'ma finesse
I'ma finesse (let's get it)
I'ma finesse
Let me Finesse (stay in that car)
Let me Finesse (I'm on the way)
I'ma Finesse
Can I finesse, (I'm otw) can I finesse
Let me finesse, I'm gon' finesse, I'm gon' finesse
I'm gon' finesse 'em
