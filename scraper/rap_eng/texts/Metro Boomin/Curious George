[Intro: Jose Guapo]
Yeah
Pablo Juan, what up, nigga?
Young Guapo, Young Guapo

[Chorus: Jose Guapo & Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Drinking syrup, words slur
Diamonds burr, burr, burr
Winter time, cop a fur
Geeking off mollies, Xans, and the Percs
Draped down in Italian
Nigga, that shit come from Italy
Nigga show your bitch a bankroll
And I bet she'll remember me
They like, "Who is that right there?"
They like, "Where you get that pair?"
They like, "How much is them?"
They like my diamonds African
Check out the Rollie from Switzerland
And I got herds you get chickens in
They like, "Them bitches be switching hands"
They like, "He be with blue M&M"

[Verse 1: Jose Guapo]
Sipping DJ Screw, Big Hawk, Pimp C
Don't look down, look around, I miss OGD
If you a pussy, we know that you got hoe tendencies
Million Dollar Kidd wearing shit from overseas
Mason Margiela's got the ostrich on it
These bitches digging me, they say they like my posture
We're loaded with choppers for all of our problems
I fuck all these bitches and they [?]
I'm high as a bitch and I'm finna get higher
I'm on that muddy
I don't do the show money dance, I just lean walk
I don't do the bullshit, baby, I just cash talk
I don't go back and forth, baby, I just cash out
In a foreign, doing 200, I'm finna smash out

[Chorus: Jose Guapo & Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Drinking syrup, words slur
Diamonds burr, burr, burr
Winter time, cop a fur
Geeking off mollies, Xans, and the Percs
Draped down in Italian
Nigga, that shit come from Italy
Nigga show your bitch a bankroll
And I bet she'll remember me
They like, "Who is that right there?"
They like, "Where you get that pair?"
They like, "How much is them?"
They like my diamonds African
Check out the Rollie from Switzerland
And I got herds you get chickens in
They like, "Them bitches be switching hands"
They like, "He be with blue M&M"

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
They like, "He got boot like Timberland"
They like, "Saw the boots and I send them in"
Lieutenant, I got them surrendering
They like, "Call me soon as you get them in"
Give me one minute, you middleman
They like, "'Cause he rhyming the Ritalin"
I really be wrapping and shipping them
I remix it like DJ Keem and them
I'm really like B.I.G. in "Notorious"
I really pour lean with Victorious
I really wrap more birds than choruses
I really drop tickets when you preorder it
Givenchy step on the brick, illiterate
Babies, they come out retarded
Really just fucking with my nigga Guapo, I really ain't even a artist
These niggas, they really just Curious... George
Run it back with the Eagles, LeSean McCoy
Justin Bieber, I got bricks of the boy
When I'm the chef, they eat full course
I'm Michael Jordan when I walk on the court
Got bars on bars on bars
But I really have so much more
Ooh, damn

[Chorus: Jose Guapo & Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Drinking syrup, words slur
Diamonds burr, burr, burr
Winter time, cop a fur
Geeking off mollies, Xans, and the Percs
Draped down in Italian
Nigga, that shit come from Italy
Nigga show your bitch a bankroll
And I bet she'll remember me
They like, "Who is that right there?"
They like, "Where you get that pair?"
They like, "How much is them?"
They like my diamonds African
Check out the Rollie from Switzerland
And I got herds you get chickens in
They like, "Them bitches be switching hands"
They like, "He be with blue M&M"
