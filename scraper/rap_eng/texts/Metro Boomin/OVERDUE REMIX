[Verse 1]
Metro Boomin with the flame
I been feeling like La Flame
My tears is mixing with the rain
I'm overdue, more or less the same
I'm sippin' on that crazy shit
Wait, what is this? Never thought of it
There's lots of it, too much of me
But I'm off the drank 'til I can't see
I'm losing it, that's on me
I'm doing it, that's on me
I'm pulling up with the strap on me
I got a masters in No Capotry (on my mama)
Bitch, I'm picking it up
I'm popping, no dropping, I can't get enough
Find me in the kitchen just whipping it up
I can't take no more, where's my double cup
I'm a Superstar like it's Culture
And I'm coming home like the Vulture
I'm front seat like a Chauffeur
But my mind is gone like a short bus (aye! ooh)

[Bridge]
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Hey!

[Verse 2]
Ok, I overdid myself, I've overdone myself
I took it off the-took it off the shelf
I think I'll kill myself, the time will tell
I overthink myself, I overdid myself
I've overdone myself
My gang kills, my aim thrills
My shots blow like a windmill
Fuck all the green, only blue bills
I'm in the zone like it's Green Hill
No justice like Man of Steel
Too many bodies, that's a multi-meal
My joy is fake, but my pain is real
Keep ya heart safe, some kill
I got Glocks, MACs, and AKs
I'm on the run like Tay K
They don't care about me like MJ
No more fake shit, that's a overlay
You think it's better now like B&B
Shoot the block up like it's TMZ
Watch The Throne like Ye and Jay-Z
I'm a demon, on God, like ZEZE (woo!)

[Verse 3]
Ok, I overdid myself, I've overdone myself
I took it off the-took it off the shelf
I think I'll kill myself, the time will tell
I overthink myself, I overdid myself
I've overdone myself
Too much ice on like a glacier
I'm drowning like a polar bear
My throat is dry like Ginger Ale
Not overdue, I oversell
Pour it up, this shit the worst
Wish I had friends that called me first
I'm signed to the streets like Lil Durk
The night young, someone getting murked
I'm 21 Savage with no heart
I'm walking around with a shopping cart
I'm dirty and broken and all scarred
I'm not ready like All-Star
Pick it up, rip it up, fisticuffs, blaow
There's no one up to stop me now
Flip it up, whip it up, sick of us, how?
No capes, only crowns
