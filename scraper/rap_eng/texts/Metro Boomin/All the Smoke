Elly gettin dough
Yo bitch give me throat
She gone let me fcuk
Call it pick & roll
C3 that's my woe
Yo main bitch a ho
If he fake on me
AK make him hit them folks
All my niggas go
All my niggas ZoeÂ 
Not your average joe
All you niggas hoes
I be out here gettin cash rain sleet or snow
Till I catch a cold
Cuz I am the goat
I get money all day like a fcukin toll
All these niggas hate on me cuz these niggas broke
The same niggas get to runnin when we up them poles
The streets fcuk wit SMG cuz we give em hope
Pull up in a coupe
Pull up & I shoot
Bullets skoo do skoo
Bullets doo do doo
I go by elly bitch
Who tf are you
You are not my manz
Nigga i don't fcuk wit u

[Chorus]
Racks on my clothes
Racks on my clothes
All you niggas broke
All you niggas broke
All you niggas hoes
All you niggas hoes
I want all the smoke
I want all the smoke
D R A C O
D R A C O
Empty the whole clip no time to reload
Think you staining me must be sniffing coke
He just mad that I ran off wit his dough

Elly in the booth..
Elly I'm the truth
Came up off finessing..
All I see is coupes
Chop the top off..
I don't see no roof
Bougie and she bad..
That's my little boo
Drape her in designer..
My shorty so cool
Wetter than sink..
Wetter than a pool
Bitch I am a dog..
All you hear is roof
D O double g..
I ain't talkin snoop
Money on my mind..
All I see is loot
I got tunnel vision..
All I see is blue
Oy that's my shooter..
All he know is shoot
Bullets do do doo..

[Chorus]
