[Intro: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
It's Auto Juan in the building
Let's go
You know what I'm saying?
My niggas right there, man
All my niggas, man, let us through
Yeah, nigga, let us through, nigga
Let's go

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
All the plugs bossed up, getting money we ain't worried 'bout nothing
All the plugs bossed up, getting money, drinking that Hitech and Tussin
All the plugs bossed up, all the plugs got the pack coming
All the plugs getting money, all the plugs got the trap bunking
Everybody 'round me get money, everybody getting money
Everybody 'round me get money, everybody getting money
Everybody 'round me get money, everybody getting money
Everybody 'round me get money, young nigga, go get money
[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Everybody 'round me got a pack, young niggas sell you an onion
Everybody 'round me tote a strap, young nigga come out busting
Don't play with them niggas, ain't no discussion
She can't [?] with the cranberry crust in it
Have it your way like it's Burger King
Quarter Pounder, McDonald's, I'm loving it
MONY POWR RSPT, we got our own government
Pineapple Sunkist, I'm 'bout to pour up in it
Every time they see a young nigga, they say, "Who is that?"
So I had to throw on a ten
All my niggas know they straight, we got benefits
Fuck these niggas, I got many men
I know these niggas don't wanna see me win
Me and [?] pull up in a [?] Benz
A lot of money, spending twenties
And we thumb through the Benjamins
I'm listening to New Edition, smoking cookies
My window like shark fins
I go back to the hood with glasses on
Proper etiquette, I'm Clark Kent
All my niggas 'bout go getting money
And ain't none of my niggas stopping

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
All the plugs bossed up, getting money we ain't worried 'bout nothing
All the plugs bossed up, getting money, drinking that Hitech and Tussin
All the plugs bossed up, all the plugs got the pack coming
All the plugs getting money, all the plugs got the trap bunking
Everybody 'round me get money, everybody getting money
Everybody 'round me get money, everybody getting money
Everybody 'round me get money, everybody getting money
Everybody 'round me get money, young nigga, go get money

[Verse 2: Johnny Cinco]
Fresh out of Uno, I'm bossed up
My crowd from Houston, I [?]
But nigga thought he had crossed us
What's a loss to a boss?
Get it back anyway
Get to the pack, I'ma sit on that pack 'cause the product gon' go
Mama showed me I could worry 'bout no hoe
Sitting in the trap is if it's all I know
Pablo and me, we gon' walk through the door
Pop out the [?] to carry the dope
[?] I ain't seen that before
All I know: everything, everything
My pinky ring like a wedding ring
This for my whole [?] with the [?]
Front wheel [?] better [?]
I ran [?] like a [?]

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
All the plugs bossed up, getting money we ain't worried 'bout nothing
All the plugs bossed up, getting money, drinking that Hitech and Tussin
All the plugs bossed up, all the plugs got the pack coming
All the plugs getting money, all the plugs got the trap bunking
Everybody 'round me get money, everybody getting money
Everybody 'round me get money, everybody getting money
Everybody 'round me get money, everybody getting money
Everybody 'round me get money, young nigga, go get money
