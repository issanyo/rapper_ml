[Hook]
I got the cash in my pocket right now and it's folded up, ain't got no wallet
I order Ace of Spades cause when I pour up I drink out the bottle
Cash on delivery, keepin' a pole on me if it's a problem
Bitch, don't spit on me, if you gone hit on me you gotta swallow

[Verse 1]
You already know the niggas that roll with me ain't nothing but robbers
You already seeing this ice that I got on, it's looking like water
'Cause already knowing this Audemar cost me like two quarters
Already knowing we jumpin on the plane, we gettin' the charter
You already knowin' I gotta get paid, so send my deposit
I seen the smoke, it was rising
Burn down the house, I was vibing
Come through the hood, I was sliding
A nigga be dead if he try me
Got a beautiful chick sitting beside me
I came from the creek, it was violent
Police in the street tryna find me
You put me on charts and I climb 'em
I was ducking them narcs, I was grinding
Now I jump 'cross the stage like I'm flying
I go harder and harder with timing
I'm just filling the void, I can't hide it
I'm just taking the poison and I know it
I got way too much money to show it

[Hook]
I got the cash in my pocket right now and it's folded up, ain't got no wallet
I order Ace of Spades cause when I pour up I drink out the bottle
Cash on delivery, keepin' a pole on me if it's a problem
Bitch, don't spit on me, if you gon' hit on me you gotta swallow

[Verse 2]
Bitch if I hit on you you gotta worship me like I'm your father
My bitch know every time we go out shopping I spend over a quarter
Big pole, sippin' and whippin' the gold, you know how I'm vibing
Sitting low, high in the back, when I pull up the Maybach be gliding
You see how I came with that Dolce, I pulled up on low, my diamonds gon' cloudy
This big gasoline when I roll up
Them V12 machine when I roll up
Pineapple pink when I roll up
Just try not to faint when I roll up
Step in the paint like I 'post up
Hopped off the train and I growed up
I was catchin' the MARTA and growed up
When I pull out garage, the door's up
I pull out a four door and chauffeur
The Lambo a topic [?]
Stop all the faking and posers
I'm the only one slangin' that raw dust
Your homies playin' with that raw 'tuss
We spend our own money, it's all us

[Hook]
I got the cash in my pocket right now and it's folded up, ain't got no wallet

Bitch, don't spit on me, if you gon hit on me you gotta swallow
I got the cash in my pocket right now and it's folded up, ain't got no wallet
I order Ace of Spades cause when I pour up I drink out the bottle
Cash on delivery, keepin' a pole on me if it's a problem
Bitch, don't spit on me, if you gon hit on me you gotta swallow
