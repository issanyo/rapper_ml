[Intro: BlitzedOffLeah]
Forgive me if they're way too loud
Forgive me if I don't come down
Lately I been up, no fair
Tryna separate what's real

[Bridge: BlitzedOffLeah]
Got no time for fuck shit, drowning in my cup
My ex is steady talking, that nigga know what's up
Life's a bitch, but I never know, I'm always sleep
Pussy so wet, he drink it up like Aquafina

[Chorus: Leah]
I do this shit everyday, give a fuck 'bout what you say
I just sit back and roll papers, I know these bitches gon' hate
I do this shit everyday, give a fuck 'bout what you say
I just sit back and roll papers, I know these bitches gon' hate

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
(Tell 'em, Juan)
I know that these niggas really be some haters
Most of these bitches want fatals
Cut a whip it's with the lightsaber
Like I'm Darth Vader
And I get up and go get the papers
Shawty go chasing the side decorated
Yeah, touching more cheese than a grater
Expensive extension, I be rocking the latest
Stuffing both my pockets, look like potatos
Drinking tootsie, Activis to the lakers
The cost of eating like like elequators
Breakdown gelato, rolling in the papers
I beat it like Mohamed Ali, the greatest
Designer drip, I can be dressed in the latest
Pull up on you in the brand new Mercedes
Niggas going broke, they play like they crazy
Kitchen man wiping, no more baby

[Chorus: Leah]
I do this shit everyday, give a fuck 'bout what you say
I just sit back and roll papers, I know these bitches gon' hate
I do this shit everyday, give a fuck 'bout what you say
I just sit back and roll papers, I know these bitches gon' hate

[Verse 2: Leah]
Excuse me if my heart's too cold
But niggas got my trust real low
I'm really feeling what you talking about
Really feeling what you talking about
Disgusting, a mess, I don't keep 'em around
Disgusting, a mess, I don't keep 'em around

[Bridge: BlitzedOffLeah]
Got no time for fuck shit, drowning in my cup
My ex is steady talking, that nigga know what's up
Life's a bitch, but I never know, I'm always sleep
Pussy so wet, he drink it up like Aquafina

[Chorus: Leah]
I do this shit everyday, give a fuck 'bout what you say
I just sit back and roll papers, I know these bitches gon' hate
I do this shit everyday, give a fuck 'bout what you say
I just sit back and roll papers, I know these bitches gon' hate
