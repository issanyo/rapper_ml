[Taylor J]
Takeoverrrrrrrr
I said I’d chill, I wasn’t gon do it
I said I’d chill, I wasn’t gon lose it
But this slow ass pill
Gon do some big things to me
No stain on steel, the chrome shine when its shootin
Poppin pain pills, cuz I don’t like these niggas
I’m a reindeer, I’ll have my niggas on your roof
I’m a drug deal, cuz I don’t like that feeling
When the money ain’t there, what’s a nigga s’pposed to do
I’ve got a hell of a plan for my niggas, nigga
Take some to make some, shake some
My OGs is my killers
Nigga I ain't worried bout nobody takin nothing
Nigga bring too much, then he suspect
I don’t think too much, could give a fuck less
A couple teams ago I had a cutlass
Now I need a paper tag, put it on my spaceship
If I make enough money nigga can’t say shit
If I get enough hundreds, never have change shit
Nigga really started from the bottom of the basement
I remember nights, cold nights, couldn’t take it
Now its buck head skies, blowing on Jamaica
Nigga that’s Taylor, friends turn to haters
Money turn to more money, flip it like a razor
Nigga play with my money Imma see you later nigga

[Hook – Taylor J]
I keep tellin these niggas I wasn’t gon do it
When I’m by myself, I’m chillin, I’m coolin
I keep tellin these niggas I wasn’t gon lose it
They keep playin, quit playin, I ain't playin my nigga
Damn, peer pressure
These niggas I wasn’t gon do it
Damn, peer pressure
When I’m by myself, I’m chillin, I’m coolin
Damn, peer pressure
I keep tellin these niggas I wasn’t gon lose it
Damn, peer pressure
They keep playin, quit playin, I ain't playin my nigga
