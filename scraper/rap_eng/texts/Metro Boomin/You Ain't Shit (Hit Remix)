[Intro Verse]
Why you say Ethan so raw, You don't gotta tell me twice
Don't guard me i'll make you fall, Its your turn to roll the dice
Ever since i was a kid, I wanted to live the life
Your dreams i've already did, Run up on me you going to afterlife

[Hook]
You ain't shit, your squad ain't shit
Elian hit stick, moving these bricks
You ain't shit, your squad ain't shit
Elian hit stick, moving these bricks

[Verse 1]
Run up on me, with my team, everything we have you dream
Staying with my gang
Johnny Dang, you wear sketchers you lame
Cruisin' down the road in a foreign
She didn't wanna smash she so borin'
While I make money y'all snorin, gonna make it rain like its pourin'
Auto-Tune on sound so good, sign with Gooniewrld if i could
Tryna get momma a jag on the hood
Focused on school yeah I know I should
I don't got money so they laughing
Wait till my diamonds start dancing, blind yo ass so you can't see
Took some pills so relaxing, imma try make baby girl happy
Cause she the one that will roll with me, runnin' outta gas almost on E
Me and my dawgs gon stack money

[Hook]
You ain't shit, your squad ain't shit
Elian hit stick, moving these bricks
You ain't shit, your squad ain't shit
Elian hit stick, moving these bricks
You ain't shit, your squad ain't shit
Elian hit stick, moving these bricks
You ain't shit, your squad ain't shit
Elian hit stick, moving these bricks

[Outro Verse]
Do it again, do it again, Everyone screaming please Ethan
Now y'all acting like yall my friends, she took nudes and then hit send
Please please leave me alone, before we get guns and run in yo home
You said I was broke you ask for a loan
Oh CKE please pick up the phone

[Hook]
You ain't shit, your squad ain't shit
Elian hit stick, moving these bricks
You ain't shit, your squad ain't shit
Elian hit stick, moving these bricks
You ain't shit, your squad ain't shit
Elian hit stick, moving these bricks
You ain't shit, your squad ain't shit
Elian hit stick, moving these bricks

[Outro]
If you have problem with me don't be fake, so much cash that you gotta use a rake
Her daddy was a baker so you know she got some cake
Diamonds so wet I swear it look like a lake
