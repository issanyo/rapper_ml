[Intro]
In 'Raris all the time
Cause I just wanna shine
And be a young nigga getting cake

[Hook x2]
It ain't my fault she calls me all the time
When I be on the grind and all these niggas want to hate
She ask why I'm in Raris all the time, cause I just want to shine
And be a young nigga getting cake

[Verse 1]
I'm on a roll, just so you know
Bitch I'm from the O, I can never sell my soul
I'm just on a money roll, 'till there's no more
But I can't never go, I just got to see that dough
I be grinding from sun high, to sun low
Chillin' with my bros making music, smoking dope
We be touring fucking hoes bitch we them Glory Boyz
It's me and Fredo and you know we got bank rolls
Pull up, kill the parking lot in foreign drops
I'ma cop a four door Porsche and I'm dropping the top
Show no love for a thot, her eyes locked on my watch
Guaranteed to get this gwop bitch, I can't drop from the top

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Call up Dro, man I need some dope
I need a bank roll; a bank roll that can't fold
You know I'ma smoke this dope 'till there's no more
Call up the dopeand tell 'em we need some more
Now lets hit the studio, it's me and Tadoe
And you now we got them hoes, got them hoes, box of rainbows
We be in the trap a lot, fucking foreign thots
I got a foreign watch and I got a foreign car
It ain't my fault this money on my line and she call me all the time
She say she don't wanna wait
She ask why I ignore her all the time
Cause I be on the grind I gotta get this cake for Kay Kay

[Hook (x2)]
