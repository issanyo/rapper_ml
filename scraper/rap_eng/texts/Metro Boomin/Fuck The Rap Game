[Intro]
*This beat is so so Metro*

[Hook]
Fuck the rap game, fuck the rap game
Fuck the rap game, fuck the rap game
All these rappers know they pussies anyway
All these rappers know they pussies anyway
Fuck the rap game, fuck the rap game
Fuck the rap game, fuck the rap game
Whether I rap or not nigga we gon' be straight
Whether I rap or not nigga we gon' be straight

[Verse]
I think I started kickin' shit the year '06
Since my heart so cold I had to ice my neck and wrist
You know I ran my check up and fucked every bitch
Real homie what it do? You know I still ain't worried 'bout shit
Purple bale down a hundred pound we got them truck load nigga
Ridin' around smokin' on Keisha
Got the F&N tucked in the console nigga
Got a lotta bands, yea we got them bands
Brrrr wanna hear a drumroll nigga
You know my niggas don give a damn
Do you want me to unload nigga
Po' up, po' up, po' up, po' up, po' up
All I drink's dirty
Old ass rapper, I think this nigga forty (Bussin'!)
Straight drop right out the pot I'm talkin' 36 (Gambino!)
I keep shooters 'round me foo, Rollie worth a brick!
I'm in Houston with 2 hoes, lookin' elegant (She bad!)
Guap-Obama in my city I'm the president (No lie!)
All these rappers goin' broke, man they full of shit (Broke)
Just hit a lick if he ain't on foreign shit (M&M's nigga!)
Million dollar kitchen I'm bout' to Forbes list (M&M's nigga!)
I shitted on my teachers in Rolls Royces
Chico end up dope in Porsches
These niggas wifin' hoes, I'm just divorcin'
If you ain't worth a mill you ain't important
And these new Giuseppe's cost your mortgage
Fuck these niggas thought? Guapo been a boss
Fuck the rap game, servin' out a loft

[Hook]
Fuck the rap game, fuck the rap game
Fuck the rap game, fuck the rap game
All these rappers know they pussies anyway
All these rappers know they pussies anyway
Fuck the rap game, fuck the rap game
Fuck the rap game, fuck the rap game
Whether I rap or not nigga we gon' be straight
Whether I rap or not nigga we gon' be straight
