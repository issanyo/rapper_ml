[Pre-Chorus]
Used to wear my shoes and look out for the dirt
Now I beat my Jordans, don't care what they worth
Don't think about it, pay my bills right on the 1st
I never thought I'd spend a thousand on a shirt

[Chorus]
This that cash talk, this that cash talk
YCFU, you cannot finagle us
Me and Metro back-to-back in Rover trucks
I want attention  so I got the orange one
This that cash talk, this that cash talk
Put a bag up, you get outlined in chalk
I just spent like forty on my watch
I'm lookin' down, I'm sittin' at the top

[Verse 1]
I used to drive Corollas with a stash box
Used to sell them dimes, I hated pausin' Xbox
Remember when I had to wrestle for the box
Now I told that bitch to suck it like Iâ€™m x-pac
Feel like I deserve Rovers, Bentleys, spurs
Thousand dollar shirts, lots of pills and syrup
What you thought? These shooters gonna serve
Brown boy from the dirt, don't get on my nerves
Fast cars like NASCAR, trap star to black cars, straps on
Don't act hard, 'bouta hit the road
I can't pick which car I'm gonna drive
I been up so many nights, I just hope that I survive

[Pre-Chorus]
Used to wear my shoes and look out for the dirt
Now I beat my Jordans, don't care what they worth
Don't think about it, pay my bills right on the 1st
I never thought I'd spend a thousand on a shirt

[Chorus]
This that cash talk, this that cash talk
YCFU, you cannot finagle us
Me and Metro back-to-back in Rover trucks
I want attention so I got the orange one
This that cash talk, this that cash talk
Pull up, I bet you get outlined in chalk
I just spent like forty on my watch
I'm lookin' down, I'm sittin' at the top

[Verse 2]
This that cash talk, this that cash talk
If you ain't talkin' money, I don't wanna talk
Two-thousand on my feet, I do the money-walk
You diss me, somethin' comin' for your head-top
I can't trust that girl, so I won't do no long-talk
I just want the head, I don't wanna make the bed rock
I fucked that bitch and I still kept my pants on
These rappers act like bitches, need some tampons
Write my shit and make my beats, everything hands-on
I'm the wrong one to put your hands on
I spent eight-hunnid to keep my pants on
Cameras watchin' me, I'm the wrong one to dance on

[Pre-Chorus]
Used to wear my shoes and look out for the dirt
Now I beat my Jordans, don't care what they worth
Don't think about it, pay my bills right on the 1st
I never thought I'd spend a thousand on a shirt

[Chorus]
This that cash talk, this that cash talk
YCFU, you cannot finagle us
Me and Metro back-to-back in Rover trucks
I want attention so I got the orange one
This that cash talk, this that cash talk
Pull up, I bet you get outlined in chalk
I just spent like forty on my watch
I'm lookin' down, I'm sittin' at the top
