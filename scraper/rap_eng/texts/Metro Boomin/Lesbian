[Chorus: Gunna]
I fell in love with a lesbian (Yeah)
Came to knock on your door, baby, let me in (Let me in)
I should've learned my lesson then (Lesson then)
I didn't wanna keep goin', I was hesitant (Didn't wanna keep goin')
I tried to ignore the evidence (Ignore it)
But I'm gon' trust myself, ain't no better than (No better than)
Bought the Rollie two tone like the President (The President)
And it ain't been no back and forth ever since

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Yeah, took the bitch on a trip, now she feelin' me (She feelin' me)
Exotic frame, a Filipin' (Frame)
No crease and no stain, no fresh and clean (No stain, fresh)
Ice out the chain with hella V's (Hella V's)
Rock the water like rain on a G-Star V (Wet, water)
I might stock up and go like I'm Mr. T (What?)
I wan' ride the new Rolls or that Bentley B (That Bentley B)
Yeah we gon' cop some Chanel, the double C (That double C)
I done bought her a bag, got her lovin' me (Yeah)
I'ma pop, I'ma flex like I'm Double D (Flex, wet)
I'ma hop on the jet, hit another city ('Nother city)
I got fans and got fans who gon' pay for me (They gon' pay for me)
I need my shit now, I can't wait a week (Can't wait a week)
I fuck on that kitty, she take it deep (She take it deep)

[Chorus: Gunna]

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I killed the boy with no evidence
I paid my dues with like every cent (Slatt slatt slatt)
And since I'm fresh as a peppermint
Rich as they come, ain't no better man (Slatt slatt slatt)
I'm rockin' gold like a treasure chest (Slatt slatt slatt)
I'm rockin' gold like I'm leprechaun (I'm rockin' gold)
I got a stick with a magazine
Young nigga fly as a pelican (Slatt slatt slatt)
I treat my boys like they one of one
I treat these hoes like they one of one (Hoes)
I smoked your dawg and you owe him one (I smoked your dog)
I smell like dope when I woke up (I smell like dope)
I made a play at Katana
Man I had nothin' but gold with some bubblegum (Bubblegum)
I got a chain, that's another sun
And I just bought another, another one (Woo)
Shorty eatin' crepes, take me way in London
Bangin' hats in Dior like I'm Farrakhan (Farrakhan)
None of my hoes don't wear Fear of God
I was just runnin' sprints and some marathons (Marathons)
Pinstripe pants make me bigger (Make me bigger)
Take an X pill, didn't kill me (Didn't kill me)
Bought the dope, turned into a dealer (To a dealer)
Throw away all the Margielas (Uh uh uh)
Sped up, didn't take up, never let up (Let up)
I done ran them M's up, the letter (Letter)
Everything sprung, got it ghetto, uh
Ridin' with a bitch and my cutter (Erk)
'Bout to dress a bitch up and then cuddle (Erk)
'Bout to feed you my pistol with diamonds (Yeah)
'Bout to pull up on you hoes with my brothers
