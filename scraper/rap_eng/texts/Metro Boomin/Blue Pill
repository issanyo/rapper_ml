[Intro: Travis Scott]
Ouu-ouu-ouu-ouuu-ouu-ouu-ah
I've been gettin' drunk as fuck
At night, can't sleep
Multiplying toes on me
Out here, yeah, okay, alright, all on me
Metro Boomin' want some more, nigga

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
We go up (straight up) in the valley (in the valley)
Where they spend mills, on the manors (on them manors)
Please, hurry up (hurry up) with my valet (with my valet)
Ain't got no time, no time, no time
No time, no time, no time, no time
Pop 'em all (pop 'em all)
You know what up (you know what up)
Call me up (call me up), when it's over (when it's over)
In the hills (in the hills), we get hi-iii-i-igh (we get high)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
That's why I'm floatin' off that blue pill, blue drank (blue drank)
It got me like I-I-I-I-I (straight up)
I'm a rockstar rollin', Shabba, I got ranks (I got ranks)
I've been rollin', rollin', I can't stop, I can't (woo)
I'm rollin' off that blue pill, blue drank (blue drank)
It got me like I-I-I-I-I (ouu-ouu-ouu)
I've been rollin', rollin', I can't stop, I can't (ouuu-ouu)
I'm a rollin' rockstar, Shabba, I got ranks (ouu-ah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
I slipped four Xans', you ain't notice
Thatâ€™s why you ghosts; hocus pocus
Take a trip out wild west
No alcohol, lean or soda
Can't last one night with the best
I'm goin' on six hangovers
Cuzzo still whippin' that 'Yota
He gettin' close to that Rover, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Refrain: Travis Scott]
Oh, why-why-why? Why-why-why?
La Flame, he got that fi-ya-ya

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
That's why I'm floatin' off that blue pill, blue drank (blue drank)
It got me like I-I-I-I-I (straight up)
I'm a rockstar rollin', Shabba, I got ranks (I got ranks)
I've been rollin', rollin', I can't stop, I can't (woo)
I'm rollin' off that blue pill, blue drank (blue drank)
It got me like I-I-I-I-I (ouu-ouu-ouu)
I've been rollin', rollin', I can't stop, I can't (ouuu-ouu)
I'm a rollin' rockstar, Shabba, I got ranks (ouu-ah)

[Refrain: Travis Scott]
Oh, why-why-why? Why-why-why?
La Flame, he got that fi-ya-ya, ya dig?

[Outro: Travis Scott]
Oooo-oooo-oooh, aaah
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
Yeah, ya-ya-yaah, ya-ya-yaah
Wah-wah-woah, wah-wah-woah
Yeah-ah, blue pill, blue drank, ouu, ouu
