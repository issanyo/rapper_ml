[Intro]
Trouble, it's 'Blo
Roll the movie, nigga
Commercials over with, nigga
You know how we coming, nigga
Real shit, nigga
Bullshit stops here, nigga
Pablo Juan, nigga, Hoodrich (I need two, nigga, huh?)
(Uno, dos, yeah)
(Oooh)

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
My shirt, belt, pants, and my shoes, exotic
My watch, ring, chain, VS1 diamonds
All these hoes wanna wife me like I'm Frankie Lymon
I was trapping in my white tee, yup, I'm grinding
Go and get the Lamb, nigga, fuck it, I need two
I'm on a bitch and her friends, nigga fuck it, I need two
I got that pistol and that chopper, nigga, fuck it, I need two
Percs and Xannys, I need two
Pour the lean, drop the deuce

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I'm in the Christian Lou's, nigga, that's a thousand for each shoe
First pistol was a Derringer, it only shot two
Givenchy Floral, got the highs and the low tops, too
I'm a rapper with a W, they know I used to rob, too
I pull up, shooting shit up, then my niggas shooting shit
Sold my first chain, was flexing, said "fuck it", went and bought two
Came through with the killers, doing one-two
I got too much sauce, she wanna fuck, but her friend, too
Drinking the Act, it cost two
Addicted to juice, poured up a deuce
Designer down from my head to my shoes
Two foreigns, one chopped off the roof
Two choppers when I ride in the coupe
Too many blunts and I still get them ran through
Strip club, that's a band or two
Trap Zoo, we got too many animals

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
My shirt, belt, pants, and my shoes, exotic
My watch, ring, chain, VS1 diamonds
All these hoes wanna wife me like I'm Frankie Lymon
I was trapping in my white tee, yup, I'm grinding
Go and get the Lamb, nigga, fuck it, I need two
I'm on a bitch and her friends, nigga fuck it, I need two
I got that pistol and that chopper, nigga, fuck it, I need two
Percs and Xannys, I need two
Pour the lean, drop the deuce

[Verse 2: DrugRixh Hect]
I was thugging out in school, all the bitches wanna fuck me
I got a bomb next day and I said fuck them teachers
Got too many hoes and too many leeches
Reclining seats when I ride in the Bentley
Check the mailbox when I walk in Givenchy
F&H on me, this bitch got extensions
I robbed too many hoes, I fucked too many bitches
I got too many sticks, I got too much extensions
I done spent too much, I lost too many niggas
I remember when I had a shootout with niggas
I done been into too many shootouts with niggas
I done wiped the whole crew out of niggas
I'll wipe your whole crew out here, nigga
Everything on me is Designer, nigga
I got too much sauce, a nigga too flashy
Too many dead niggas, too many rags
Don't let the rap fool you, I'll still spank a nigga's ass
Designer on my bag when I smoke too many bags
Ride in a foreign with a paper tag
My shirt, belt, jeans, I Designered that
Two trap sticks, two hundred rounds

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
My shirt, belt, pants, and my shoes, exotic
My watch, ring, chain, VS1 diamonds
All these hoes wanna wife me like I'm Frankie Lymon
I was trapping in my white tee, yup, I'm grinding
Go and get the Lamb, nigga, fuck it, I need two
I'm on a bitch and her friends, nigga fuck it, I need two
I got that pistol and that chopper, nigga, fuck it, I need two
Percs and Xannys, I need two
Pour the lean, drop the deuce

[Outro: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Chanels in Jeffery's, I need them, too
Red bottoms, red and the black, got them, too
My shoes cost a two
My hoe know what to do
My hoe get money, too
My hoe might shoot them, too
I ain't got on two chains, but I got on chains, too
Two, yeah
Two, nigga
Fuck you, nigga
And you, nigga
Fuck you too, nigga
