[Bridge]
We popping bottles in the club, she just pour a lil mo'
Sipping lean in my section, I just pour up a fo'
We throw them racks in the air, watch 'em fall to the flo'
Put some hunnids on her ass and she showing 'em off, she go

[Hook]
Up and down, she go up and down
Up and down, she go up and down
Like a beaver, oh, yee-haw
I got yo' bitch all on my dick, like a seesaw
Seesaw, seesaw
I got yo' bitch all on my dick, like a seesaw
Like a beaver, oh, yee-haw
I got yo' bitch all on my dick, like a seesaw

[Verse 1]
We popping bottles in this club, we just poured a lil mo'
I'm sipping lean in my section, I just poured up a fo'
We be kidnapping these bitches
Probably on the road to riches
Fucking right, we want the digits
Stack that money up, we get it again
Get it again, yeah, oh
Throw a lil, got some chicken
Then she threw back that lil chicken
Like a two piece, get a biscuit
I put it right on the scale, ay
Give her that dick, it take her

[Hook]
Up and down, she go up and down
Up and down, she go up and down
Like a beaver, oh, yee-haw
I got yo' bitch all on my dick, like a seesaw
Like a beaver, yeah, yee-haw
I got yo' bitch all on my dick, like a seesaw

[Verse 2]
Bitch, we the hot sauce

She say she want that rock star dick
Fuck Kings of D Roy
I pull up, we show
Then we throw ones on your hoe
We geeking so hard in the back of this club
So we throwing the most
Racing bitches in these 'Raris
If you Bobby, we retarded
Like a sign, I'm so New Orleans
Fuck that "Jumpman," we been ballin'

Bitch, you act like we in Portland
All that beef shit ain't important

[Hook]
Up and down, she go up and down
Up and down, she go up and down
Like a beaver, oh, yee-haw
I got yo' bitch all on my dick, like a seesaw
Seesaw, seesaw
I got yo' bitch all on my dick, like a seesaw
Like a beaver, yeah, yee-haw
I got yo' bitch all on my dick, like a seesaw

[Bridge]
Popping bottles in the club, she just pour a lil mo'
Sipping lean in my section, I just pour up a fo'
We throw them racks in the air, watch 'em fall to the flo'
Put some hunnids on her ass and she showing 'em off, she go

[Hook]
