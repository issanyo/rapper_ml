[Verse 1: Famous Dex & Dice SoHo]
Young nigga get to the guala
Benjamin’s all in my pocket
I’m popping two pills, I can’t stop it
I’m taking off just like a rocket
I’m coolin’ LA, me and Dice-O
We fuck on two bitches then we iso
She want me to stay, tell her leggo
I got to get bricks and my pesos
Back then I ain’t have no guala
Now all these bitches wanna holla
She want to go shoppin’, baby girl stop it
I can’t buy you no Prada
Tell her work like Rihanna, oohSteppin’ in Balenciaga, ooh
I know she just want me for my juice
Drop a deuce and now I’m on snooze
And then I pull up in a Bentley coupe
Fuck the top, had to drop the roof
Smoking dope, bitch I feel like Snoop
Catch an opp then you know I’ma shoot
But I pull up in srt8
I had to go pour me an eight
I fucked your little bitch, you was late
And then I bust up in her face
