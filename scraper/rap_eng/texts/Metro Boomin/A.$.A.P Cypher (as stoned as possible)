[Intro]
Reefä: Yo yo yo
Do you wanna set it off g?

Chief Wiggin': Yeah I'll start the cypher off nigga
Let's start it off
Yo, yo
Yo yo
This is the cypher
40 second bars nigga

Reefä: Yo

[Verse 1: Chief Wiggin']
I walk in the streets of fuckin' HP
Best MC, I'm gifted lyrically
Cos I can feel this magically
And I still got the fuckin' flow
I'm gonna pull a hoe
While they suck on my toes
My mind is kinda twisted
I'm kinda fuckin' gifted
And everybody knows I do this the fuckin' quickest
With the fuckin' flow
I don't give a fuck, cos you know the go
Now I got the best hydro
Puffing on the chronicle
Cos I'm at the pinnacle
I guess it's kinda cynical
Cos you're typical
So shut the fuck up before you get an uppercut
So let's pass this off to Shereef with the 3fa
Nigga

[Verse 2: Reefä]
Yo
It's fuckin' Reefä, nigga
It's fuckin' Reefä, nigga
It's fuckin' Reefä, nigga
Don't make me pull the fuckin' trigger
Cos you know
I come through with the fresh flows, yo
And I always do it with my fuckin' bros
And you know
We just kill the fuckin' lyrics
You fuckin' hear it
Yeah, I'm fuckin' high like the ceiling
You feel it, I'm killin' these bars, like Jaws
Oh shit, he's crawling in the mother fuckin' water
See his fin comin' out
That nigga will bite you, uh
Nigga it's the mother fuckin' cypher
With the viper
And to mother fuckin' D, ah
Comin' through with the fresh rhymes with me, oh
Yeah, it's just 1-2-3, now check it
(1-2-3, now check it)

[Verse 3: $koop]
You see
Y'all committin' lyrically travesty
I can't believe you have the audacity
To doubt the capacity
Of a nigga like me
You should bow down, I am your majesty
I traverse in the land like a
Surveyor, the rhyme slayer, ill mind
Elevator, they call me the Darth Vader
There is no one greater
My flow smarter
Delicious main courses, not a fuckin' starter
Hood nigga never dressin' your daughter
I got silk pants, and silk shirts
Dope rappers, I get all the fuckin' perps
I see perspiration, nigga
More like masturbation, they hesitatin'
When I come to the fuckin' spot you just drop
(When I come to the fuckin' spot you just drop)
