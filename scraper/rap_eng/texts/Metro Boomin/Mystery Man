[Intro Poem: Gnarly Nate]
The loneliest of nights
Yet I'm not alone
The darkness is alive
Yet has no soul
Are my thoughts running wild?
Are they who to blame?
Is all this even real?
Or is my mind playing games?
Whatever the case...
I must overcome it
If this is my end
Then fear I must stomach
Whatever the outcome
I cannot cower now
If this is my maker
Together, we go down!

[Bridge: Forrest Slump]
I just want to pilot spaceships
See if Mystery Man chase it
See if Mystery Man chase it
Let that muthafucka chase it
I want me my own spaceship
See if Mystery Man chase it
Let that muthafucka chase it
I'll see you in hell!

[hook: Forrest Slump]
Mystery Man
He's standing over me
Making it impossible to sleep
He's here right now
He's also in my dreams
His hands they're cold
They've got a hold of me
Now I can't breathe
He's got a hold on me
Now I can't see
Refusing to believe
He's here right now
He's also in my dreams
Mystery Man
He's taking over me

[Verse 1: Forrest Slump]
It's faceless
Can't distinguish it's gender
I keep seeing the figures
No 'I don't want to remember
Hands cold as December
When it touch
Go numb
Sleep paralysis son
Got no way to run
Left his mark in reality
Proud to be
Alive and well
Not victim to a fatality
Gravity
The only thing holding me down
At this point man
Join hands with the muthafucka next to you
Coo coo
Niggas think I'm crazy
Won't retaliate
Unless a muthafucka make me
Save me from all these rotten minds
I've got a lot in mind
Been staying above water level
Letting father the time
Be the one to tell
Won't be the one to fail
And everything that I would see
It turned to what I'd feel
That's when shit get real
Shit, it's fight or flight
I won't rest until this evil dies
Or meets I, it's maker
Oh, this shadow's getting out of control
No you won't see me cry
Still got hope
No you won't run my life
I feel bold tonight
I feel bold
Eye to eye
Toe to toe
