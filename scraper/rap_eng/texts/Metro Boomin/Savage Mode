[Intro]
If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gonna shoot you

[Verse 1]
Spent 1000 dollars just to sip (just to sip muddy)
Park that motherfucker in the VIP (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
I got that motherfucker on my hip (chh, chh)
I'ma squeeze (baow), I'ma squeeze (baow)
We ain't really with all that internet shit (21)
We ain't really with that pretending and shit (21)
Come and get your bitch, she actin' friendly and shit
When I get inside that pussy, I be killin' that shit (killin', killin')

[Chorus]
I'm in savage mode (woah), I'm in savage mode (woah)
I'm in savage mode (woah), I'm in savage mode

Pew-pew (pew-pew), bet yo' ass don't stare (21)
Red bottoms, yeah (red)

[Verse 3]
All that backstabbin' turned me to a savage (savage)
All that fuckin' krabbin' turned me to a savage (it did)
Racks inside the mattress turned me to a savage (racks, racks)
I turned to a savage, bitch, I gotta have it (I gotta have it)
Fell asleep in science, I love mathematics (countin' cash)
Bitch, I like to add, bitch, I like subtractin' (that countin' cash)
That chopper flip a nigga like he acrobatic (pop, pop, pop)
He don't want no smoke, he don't want no static (want no static)
I'm in savage mode, shit can get tragic (yah)
I might toe tag him, I might body bag him (woah, woah)
These bitches gettin' old, I already had 'em ('ready had 'em)
She wanna live lavish, she don't meet my standards (21, 21)

[Chorus]
I'm in savage mode (woah), I'm in savage mode (woah)
I'm in savage mode (woah), I'm in savage mode
I'm a savage on these hoes (savage), savage on these hoes (woah)
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes (woah)
I'm in savage mode (21), I'm in savage mode (savage)
I'm in savage mode (savage), I'm in savage mode
I'm a savage on these hoes (21), savage on these hoes (21)
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes

[Outro]
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
