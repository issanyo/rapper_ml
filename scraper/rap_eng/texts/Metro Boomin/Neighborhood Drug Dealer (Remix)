[Verse 1: Future]
Roll a pound of weed tomorrow
Coochie city, where the carpet?
Sellin' yay inside the grocery store
Miley Cyrus, my portfolio
My style's outta here, Ebola
They runnin' outta bakin' soda
Wrap a bricks inside some foil
Them Franklin niggas sellin' oil
Mexicano bought me some new punani
Fuck that bitch, I'm on some new punani
Flip a chicken, but some new punani
Got the kitchen smellin' like punani
Bought a Bugatti with your re-up
Bought a new watch with your re-up
Bought a new chain with your re-up
Fuck you lil pussys that have re-up
Sellin' and fib that re-up
I keep that dog with me nigga
I charge 90 a brick for a nigga
I got that food on my face
I get your hit on my face
I make her sit on your face
While I go dig in your safe
I got to war for a cake
I take your trial like an ape
I whip a key and a lake
I put your bitch in some bape (Whip!)

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Uh, I'm your neighborhood drug dealer
Its your neighborhood drug dealer
Uh, its your neighborhood drug dealer
I'm your neighborhood drug dealer
Neighborhood drug dealer
Its your neighborhood drug dealer
One, two, what it be?

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Bet you hear my pipes rev when I tip the scale
Rich forever, still a muscle and it never fails
You a house nigga so they let you get the mail
We in the back whippin' egg whites and crackin' shells
Robin jeans for my team, pocket for the sale
Pussy niggas gossip pray you die from gonorrhea
Al Capone where I'm from that Benzo bullet proof
Neighborhood dope boy you can get it too
Fuck them pussy niggas catch they ass at Smoothie Kings
Hundred missed calls after that new toolie rings
Skip South Beach bitch bring it to the ridge
For that change, put that thing right up to your ribs

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Uh, I'm your neighborhood drug dealer
Its your neighborhood drug dealer
Uh, its your neighborhood drug dealer
I'm your neighborhood drug dealer
Neighborhood drug dealer
Its your neighborhood drug dealer
One, two, what it be?

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Chevy SS, she heard I bump fire
Got row houses up and down through Pembroke Pines
Say the streets talk, I say its bout time
Bal Harbor on my mama been about mine
Still pay my child support, in all trap money
All 5's and 10's, can't touch my rap money
She won't fuck with me, I'm hatin', yeah her pussy stank
Meet your amigo mama then you crack the piggie bank
Dope boy dream, never lose it all
Montgomery Alabama know we love the send 'em soft
Baton Rouge's a Actavis and act a fool
Neighborhood dope boy you should hit me too


[Hook: Rick Ross]
Uh, I'm your neighborhood drug dealer
Its your neighborhood drug dealer
Uh, its your neighborhood drug dealer
I'm your neighborhood drug dealer
Neighborhood drug dealer
Its your neighborhood drug dealer
