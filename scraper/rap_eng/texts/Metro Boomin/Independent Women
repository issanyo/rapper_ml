Verse one - Ge

She works like a slave

I'm still painting my way
No canvas, no brushes

No questions, no answers

Its probably gonna break
The blunts is coming
I can't feel my face
I'm so high can't remember my name
I'm so high can't remember my name
I'm so high can't remember my name
If I die I'll still remain
I'm so fly I ride in a cave
I'm so fly I ride in a cave
If she lie ima cum in her face
She so fly we met her in space
She told me she's inlove with Drake
(Haa, haa)
I told her if she cum ima cum to
