[Verse 1]
It's time to boot up on them petty bitches
Fuck them hoes who out here on the come-up petty living
I can't stop booting up, I don't know my limit
Really in the game, why you niggas in a scrimmage
Had to break away from niggas, got a different vision
I just sold like forty bags all on different women
Niggas steady stealing swag, and they know they timid
I been flexing with that cash, talking real spinach
Niggas watching what I had but I'm still spending
Took a gram and a half, now the room spinning
Spent a quarter and a half on that mall pending
She came like a fool with a million pending
Pray to God every day and I'm still sinning
Took a trip to L.A, I can't stop sinning
I can't rock that Bape if it ain't vintage
True, if your money late I need that shit with interest
Most these niggas fake and I been stacking digits
And if we fall off we gon' sell that midget
Took a hospital trip and I'm still sipping
I'm stuck all in my ways, you gotta live with it

[Hook]
I'm on that sand, man
Sandman, I'm on that sand, man

Sandman, I'm on that sand, man
That sand, man
Sandman, I'm on that sand, man

Sandman, I'm on that sand, man
That molly santan
I'm on that molly santan
I'm on that molly santan
I'm on that molly santan
I'm on that molly santan

[Verse 2]
You lil niggas think you ill ain't never a nigga iller
Still riding round with the choppa screaming free Skrilla
And my young niggas stay finessing, that's that free skrilla
Bet that chopper make you stutter, that's a hundred round spitter
And I might just hit the bitch even though she ain't my type
I been dabbing like a fool, nigga that's a molly night
I'm a certified savage, dick all in her overbite
Kick that bitch and put her out, yeah she here not overnight
I just had a band fight, hit that ho with a stack-o
I just poured a whole pint in my purple Bape camo
On my dirt gang shit, hit your bitch in the bando
And I'm lit like a bitch and I ain't talking 'bout no candle
Yeah my young niggas be lit, ho we came with plenty ammo
And these pussy niggas watching swear to God I need a channel
I swear these niggas make me sick, boy you never lived that life
I don't wanna hear shit, keep your old school advice
And your bitch gon' suck a dick for some Jordans and some rice
I been balling like a bitch, I forgot the extra price
I said I'm rolling like a bitch, I swear this molly got me right
Give a damn how they feel, give a fuck what they like
