[Intro - Almighty U-Sorcerer]
Welcome to the good bit, motherfucker. (Metro Boomin' want some more, nigga!)

[Hook - Almighty U-Sorcerer]
Leather and latex, fucked her on the tape deck
If I can't get a paycheck, then it don't make sense
Broke hoes, take a rain check, y'all get a trainwreck
Y'all must be brain dead if you think this unsafe sex

[Verse 1 - Gamemast15r]
You all small fry motherfuckers, I could grill bigger
When I’m around, ain’t no sunshine like Bill Withers
The mind of the Unabomber with a hand full of pills
With the disproportionate violence of Hamburger Hill
I feel no love, fuck romance, peel those slugs
All I feel is sex, drugs, and kill those thugs
Leather and latex, I don’t know whether to stay next
After it’s done, you’ll know whether or not I play sex
Place bets on whether or not I can last too long
She got my dick wet, she got the ass for a thong
She tied me down, did a backflip, and split on my dick
What the fuck, she got me digging her ditch
That’s what I get for tryin' to stick in the clit
Put a bandana in my mouth and yell “Start listenin' bitch”
She filthy, try to swallow whole my willy
Quoteth Ice-T, “That Bitch Tried To Kill Me”

[Verse 2 - ThaHipHopHead]
This ain’t no Romeo, and Juliet, this is more like Kim
Why the fuck I take you back every week, just so you go back to him?
So childish, how you toy with my emotions, I’m about to explode
In my house, clothing strewn across the floor, in bed arousing my foe
Open the bedroom door, she tries to hide his head in the sheets
Two shots, now who’s got his fool top all over the sheets
The cheater screams, still got seven in my steel
Drop the chrome, hop over, and grab her with these
Hands, same hands I used to treat you with so gently
I let you drive the Bentley, we were both high, and friendly
But you drove me to this frenzy, fuck, now I feel so empty
This is what happens when you keep tempting me
…Shit, her skin is staying an amethyst color
Her brother Steve isn’t going to like this when it’s discovered
Bind her, tie her up, stuff her in the upper cupboard
Drive off, a shot to ease my mind, my direction southern

[Verse 3 - Almighty U-Sorcerer]
The following statements are a sequence
I'm creeping with this girl, but she only want the penis
With my regiment, specimen, it's no scheduling
New testament, resident of the excellence
When I sleep with a girl, I don't let my sperm go to waste
She say "Choke me", then she gon' be choking like Golden State
Need a cute broad, not one of them local honies
Not one of them social media, no social studies
I need a girl that always come to an agreement
And cheers just as much as I do when I get achievements
So I finally met the girl of my dreams in the cafeteria
Been going out for a month, she give head, no bacteria
First time in the bedroom and she giving good top
Before, had her screaming like a crowd at Woodstock
She say "Choke me", I choked the fuck outta that redbone
First time getting head and putting bitches on a headstone

[Verse 4 - KUZGUN]
Fuck niggas flashing fo-fo’s and fo-do’s all in their fucking photos
Don’t fucking know why they can’t afford a plan for their phones, though
Y'all niggas yapping sound like an average nigga’s old hoe
Sammy stopped doing drugs, and started doing so-so
I can’t keep a ‘ship together, so I bought me my own boat
My shit so big, I fuck around, make Yachty look like a row boat
Re-Up Gang sellin’ that Rita, fam, so niggas had that poppy, no Reina, damn
In my own class, made a classic, so I never liked my teacher, man
Niggas talkin' Northside gangs, we got shooters in North Korea, damn
Runnin' this, I am a leader, damn, new chick got four D cups, man, like she was a liter, man
I’m a dog, running this shit made me feel like a Greyhound
I couldn’t ride or die for anything, so I chose to switch my lane now
Lyrics hot, May weather, so they trynna put me in the box, Mayweather, TMT
Either that or box me out and put me on TMZ
Bitches ain’t fuck with me ‘cause there wasn’t shit they could see in me
Now the money too tall, ain’t no motherfucking seeing me
