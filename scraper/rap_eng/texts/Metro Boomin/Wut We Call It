[Hook: Future]
You drinking on lean, we call it that wafa house
Your car go one fifty we call it spaceship
You drunk that door two time, we call it water whip
You rolling up kush, we call it that gasoline
Wut we call it, that's wut we call it
That’s wut we call it, that's wut we call it, turn up
You rocking, get diamonds we call it satellite
You shoot it no chopper, we call it 'bout that life

[Verse 1: Test]
Look look, bad yellow bitch call the foreign
Import the body over water, talking Caribbean
That’s the transfer, yeah that's what we call ignore
Get it transferred, and then put some money on it
Call the play, call the bitch, call the shots, call me rich
And somebody calling my phone, blacking numbers
Who the fuck is this?
Everything so spacious, everybody so anxious
Cut your, cut your bitch no band-aid
Sip serve no pancakes, I'm just showing up for my fan base
If the cause, cause one fifty
Tell shawty to let here mami, you gonna get that in a jiffy, hey

Diamonds on my neck, comas in my check
This water nigga call it, when that lean got me fallin'
Future tell em

[Verse 2: Test]
Bang-bang for that little pistol
Brrack for that big chopper
Chris pause in that ambulance, that order up, that helicopter
Free band, free band, nigga got mess all in they face
Ain’t no costumes, no mascarade, nigga give it up, you getting got today
Money all in your top, we invade your block
Parade at your spot, let the drums go, look look
It’s gas all in my blunt, lean all in my cup
I'm in the foreign car and I’m wasted
This shit you're driving so basic
Hold up bitch, I'm talking, let me finish my convo
My bitch tell you I'm bossing, that’s why I call her my ho
Eating good, that's appetite, jury on that satellite
Big car that spaceship, bitch molly in it and I'll taste it

[Verse 3: Mexico Rann]
Two yappas on me AKA them sticks
Half a the square on me AKA a split
Louie slipper rocking bear flipping ass nigga
Foreign coupe swerving with them missiles
Mouth full of crystals, screaming fuck the system
Room full of bud, a cup full of mud
Clientele calling it's time to re em up
Sold them ten squares without an ounce to cup
Lean with the molly AKA the monster cup
While I'm standing over the stove, fucking up the bowl
1-25, 212-24, that's an insta hundred grams damn near a four
