[Intro: Paycheck & EC]
Ayy
On the beat

[Verse 1: Paycheck]
I'm boutta run into this game and I'll pound it
Around it
After I'm done I'll leave, leave people astounded
Yes I may be white
But I’m rappin
You lackin
I’ll compress you up and store you away
Like I'm packin
Remixing trap beats like Zero
But see though
See ho
I ain’t robotic like 3-P-O
My word play is fantastic, your song’s drastic
Your chances of a hit are weaker than elastic
Heard the first verse and I said “oh thats it?”
On my last tape I maxed it then I faxed it
To your mother and she said “this fantastic”
Put that ish on iTunes, the government taxed it
Ay, yo
Back up on the track
30k streams in a month, (oh thats a rack)
White and 14, (oh dang thats a wrap)
Gimme 6 months and you know I’m boutta lap
All these mumble rappers
Cause they know I'm boutta clap
Gimme a fresh beat
Man I guarrentee I'll snap
On a rap, rhyme sticky
Man it's kinda like some sap
And I’m headed to the top
No limit, no cap

[Sample: EC & Jay Shifler]
Quick get out of the water, you need a lifeguard!
Wait, this isn't the beach, this is a bathtub!
(Lifeguard!)
(Bathtub!)

[Verse 4: Paycheck & EC]
Finish up a nice track
Then I’ll bring it right back
Add a little hook
You know it’ll be nice, fact
I'm reppin from the Empire State
Paycheck holdin down homeplate
We just made a quick hit
And you know that it’s lit
Never try to cross us with that
Ric Flair Drip
(Go whoo!)
