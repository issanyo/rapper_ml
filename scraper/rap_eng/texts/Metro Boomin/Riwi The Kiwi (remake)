"Lil grov, hvem snakker jeg med?"
"Det er Broke tennisklasker, skal ikke cooke opp en liten remake eller?"
"Ahh, den var jo ganske trash forrige gang da"
"Bro, den har 550 avspillinger på soundcloud, tenk så mange avspillinger denne kommer til å få da"
"Jaa, ok da"
Deilig, jeg caller opp Metro boomin nå"

Fyfaen as, sommeren 1965, det var tider det
Chiller på stranda med en kald isbjørn

As i stroll to the bank
I drink some giant purple drank (lean)
Going to a vault , and i meet a skinny skank (hoe)
She leaps on past and croaks at me, i say to her «whats wrong?» (skrra)
The skank she grunts ning nong
And hops along her way

As i stroll on down the street
Brand new Jordans on my feet (Michael)
Going to my house, about to beat my meat (dick)
My penis won't go hard today
I say to it whats wrong? (whats wrong)
The dick it squeals ning nong
And scurries on its way

As i stroll down the path
2+2 is 4 quick math (Big Shaq)
Going to a class, this school can lick my ass (butthole)
The Teacher looks at me, i say to him whats wrong? (whats wrong)
The teacher bleats ning nong
And hurries on his way

As i stroll down the lane
I meet a rapper, gucci mane (scucci)
Going to a party, can i come he asks so nice (nah ni**a)
I shake my head and neighs at him, he say to me whats wrong? (what up)
You know i snort ning nong
And trots along my way

As i stroll on down the track
I meet a shawty, she a snack (muesli)
Going to my house, u know we bout to crack (cold one)
I pop a cold open it won't go somethings wrong (won't open)
Dont be daft you nutty ning nong
The cold one fades away

As i drive thru the hood
I kill a nibba like i should (kill)
Going for a drive-by, in my e class Benz (shiit)
Seeing all these bitches thru this thick ass lens (glasses)
Musadas gang pulling up, we cannot be friends
Fuck u up with uzi with the money i spend (grra)

Fyfaen, Natasha Bedingfield er milf as
Throwback 2004, unwritten
Yayeet!
