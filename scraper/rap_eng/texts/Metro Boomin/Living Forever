BOZ:

Fuck all these haters
They hating on great now they mad that I made it myself
I'm over these haters
Fuck all these friends
They smile to my face
Hoping I fall down till the end
I'm over these friends
Fuck all these bitches
They speak about love but they are gone when things are bad
I'm over these bitches

I'm bout my bands
I'm bout my mula
I'm bout my money, I keep it 100, I come with the ruler

My money forever
Living forever
Forever and ever
Shelther you better
No matter the weather

Living forever
Ever and ever
I cannot die
Only get better
Fucking her better but I never settle
Money on my mind, forever young, living forever

MICU PRINZZ:

They speak on the boy like he got it
Yeah cus he got it foreal
Lil baby drip like a faucet cus I be fucking her still
She know how I feel
Ask bout the ex I ain't texting her back, pop me a pill
If I do it, she do it, no question about it
Keep all that drama concealed

I been tryna get around stacking my cheddar
Blow dank by the Oz, got hoes in different area codes
Yeah she tryna go down but I'm fed up
Talk that talk, gang gon' peel you off, yeah that's how it goes

BOZ:

Living forever
Ever and ever
I cannot die
Only get better
Fucking her better but I never settle
Money on my mind, forever young, living forever
