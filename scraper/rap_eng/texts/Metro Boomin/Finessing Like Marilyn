[Hook]
If you can't handle my worst then you don't deserve my best
In a league of my own I ain't nothing like the rest
A gem, something like a needle in a haystack
Hold a nigga down from the Honda to the Maybach
But then I realized that niggas be lyin'
So I threw in the towelthen I stop tryin'
No more back and forth arguing, fighting, and addressing
I got in my bag then I started finessing (finessing, I'm finessing)

[Verse 1]
Like Marilyn Monroe
With a smile I can pimp a nigga straight out his dough
Bitch head to my toes I be dripping like a faucet
He said that he love me Arkham Asylum he lost it (haha)
Honey, I really don't love nothing, but my diamonds and my bands
This nigga in my hair bitch he be hanging by them strands
Its that pretty fem boy with that bogie vernacular
They be copying my style they be sucking me dracular
Tip toeing to beat any haters obsolete
Cause they can't deny the fact that I'm the coldest in the streets
Real anti bitch I be mobbing on my lonely
Hating hoes wanna be me (ha)
Bitch if only (stop it)
I'm really killing shit and it's only the beginning
Spotify front page niggas know that I'm winning
Everywhere that I go I be fashion show ready
I'm my own best friend bitch Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Got them black coffin nails cause I kill these bitches dead
Ain't no rice and cabbages call it greens and cornbread
I'm the only one for the part ain't no more auditions
Finessing like Marilyn is really the only mission

Love? N-N-Never experienced that emotion
The money is the only thing that got my whole devotion
Play these niggas like a tambourine
Pull up in a limousine
Snatch hoes when I hit the scene
It ain't no way to intervene
Not Jason Voorhees, but they know that I'm a killer
Serve a look and leave them shook in that fur chinchilla
Finesse like Marilyn reel in men like a fisher
Steal that nigga heart and break him down like a swisher
If the roles were reversed and a nigga tried to play me
Honey know for a fact that bitch it would never phase me
I applaud that ass for trying, but this heart is made of diamonds
You can't stop the kid from shining
I be kick back no reclining

To even get my attention you gotta be lucky
A nigga really focused on that cheese bitch no Chuck.E
If I rap about it baby know that I own it
Tryna copy my style broke bitch you gotta loan me
Hopped on this instrumental
Bars fucking with you mental
Wrecked the nigga hope he got some incidental
Oh he was yours I gave him back just like a rental
I'm a big dog bitch you can't keep me in the kennel
No Marilyn Wanns, but I'm a menace to society
I keep these niggas around just for the variety
Finesse it like I'm Marilyn Monroe
Emptied his pockets, broke his heart and now he calling me a hoe

[Hook]
If you can't handle my worst then you don't deserve my best
In a league of my own I ain't nothing like the rest
A gem, something like a needle in a haystack
Hold a nigga down from the Honda to the Maybach
But then I realized that niggas be lyin' so I threw in the towel
Then I stop tryin'
No more back and forth arguing, fighting, and addressing
I got in my bag then I started finessing (finessing, I'm finessing)
