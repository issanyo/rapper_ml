[Intro]
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Verse 1]
They tell me, "Don't forget where you came from"
I regret what I came from
In my old hood moving like I got a vest on me
I'ma keep on winning, you should place your bets on me
I could open up a bakery, baguettes on me
Walking through the mall, I got a check on me
Designer look the best on me
I got lots of pressure, lotsa stress on me
Independent, I got people that depend on me
Knew you was a fake, you can't pretend on me
What I used to spend on you, I spend on me
Somehow all these problems keep on landing on me
I went on a mission with a bad bitch
3AM, I'm getting Backwoods like I'm average
All this money turned me to a savage
My life was better when I didn't have shit

[Chorus]
Do you know how it feel to feel alone?
Bought myself a house, still feel like I ain't home
Driving by myself, ain't got nowhere to go
I just took two 30s, now I'm in my zone
Are you really here for me? I don't know
Are you really here for me? I don't know
Are you really here for me? I don't know
Are you really here for me? I don't know

[Verse 2]
Me and Metro Boomin' want some more, yah
All this money made me bored, yah
But there's lots of drugs to explore, yah
I'm a boss, yeah, I could employ ya
Couldn't buy one, now I got four, yah
Used to pray feds don't kick down the door, yah
Running back the sack the trap feel like a sport, yah
Yeah I'm famous but I miss my life before, yah
Finally got some money, can't go to the store
I lose every girl I love when I'm on tour
My mama calling me and I ignore
Running from my problems 'til my feet get sore

[Chorus]
Do you know how it feel to feel alone?
Bought myself a house, still feel like I ain't home
Driving by myself, ain't got nowhere to go
I just took two 30s, now I'm in my zone
Are you really here for me? I don't know
Are you really here for me? I don't know
Are you really here for me? I don't know
Are you really here for me? I don't know

[Verse 3]
I got what you need, you feeling lonely?
I need, I need you to hold me
I hope you mean everything that you told me
I'll try to come back to you, girl, I'm sorry
If you miss me just call me
You try to diss me 'cause you salty
Did this on my own, it's all me
I just wish that you would call me

[Outro]
Call me
I just wish that you would call me up
Wish that you would call me
I just wish that you would call me up
Wish that you would call me
I just wish that you would call me up
Wish that you would call me
I just wish that you would call me up
Me up
Just wish that you would call me up
Me up, me up
I just wish that you would call me up
(Me up, me up)
I just wish that you would call me up
Me up
