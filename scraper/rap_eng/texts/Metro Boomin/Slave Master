[Intro]
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro

[Hook]
Just bought a new whip, nigga, like I'm a slave master
I pour up two zips nigga I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
Just bought a new whip, nigga, I got my a slave master
I pour up two zips nigga I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better

[Verse 1]
Brooklyn ridin' with us, got my jeweler ridin' with me
Watch us drift off this good dodie
I can't provoke all these killas won't go though
Puttin' it in twelve o'clock, smash up the script
Bitch put some ash in your bitch, she a rip
She came unfaithful off pill for real
Do it for niggas who here, do it for niggas who gone
Do it for Double he gone, do it for Double he gone
Do it the way that we want, do it the way that we want
Do it the way that you want
Stayin' true to this culture
Don't get caught tryna be a vulture
Put a pinky ring on my pinky finger
Got some VVS's on my middle finger
Fuck you pussy niggas, all you niggas get the middle finger
I'm just keepin' it triller, G

[Hook]
Just bought a new whip, nigga, like I'm a slave master
I pour two zips nigga I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
Just bought a new whip, nigga, like a slave master
I pour two zips nigga I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better

[Verse 2]
Got a bale on ya, tryna smoke one
Got a clean watch with no diamonds in it
Got a fish spot with that Molly in it
Got a two door coupe, four choppas in it
With a pound of Mary, I'm busy
I'm drinkin' the codeine, I feel it, I'm rollin' the dope when I feel it
I fuck with your ho, she can get it
I stack up some chickens and get it
Gon' sell a bill in the trap
We gon' put your hood on the map
Show all them bitches you care, show all them bitches you real
I see how they watch and they imitate me
This gold AP got 'em fascinated
Ain't no fabrication, I'm on medication
Cough syrup, I'm infatuated
Got your old girl she infatuated
Call her right now if you need me
I'mma try to be there if you need me
Try my best to be there if you need me
I'm keepin' my word on everythin'
Put some Aquafina on another ring
I disguise pain when I make it rain
When I hit the club and I make it rain
When I pulled up, you know how I came

[Hook]
Just bought a new whip, nigga, like I'm a slave master
I pour two zips nigga I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better

[Outro]
Brooklyn ridin' with us, got my jeweler ridin' with me
Do it for Double he gone, do it for Double he gone
Long live A$AP Yams, long live A$AP Yams
Long live A$AP Yams, I'm on that codeine right now
Long live A$AP Yams, long live A$AP Yams
Long live A$AP Yams, I'm on that codeine right now
