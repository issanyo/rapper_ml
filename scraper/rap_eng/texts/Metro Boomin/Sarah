Sarah, you know you was my favorite girl
I still think about you girl
I wonder where you are in this world

I'm saying, Sarah, you know you was my favorite girl
I always think about you girl
I wonder where you are in this world

Oh, Sarah, you know I think about you girl
I'm waiting on my favorite girl
I wonder where you are in the world

Seems like, every time, I can't even sleep at night
Your face always haunting mine
Wonder if I'm doing right, I'm wondering

Sarah, where are you now
I should've stayed down
You know I love you now

I'm saying, Sarah, you know you was my favorite girl
I still think about you girl
I wonder where you are in this world

I'm saying, Sarah, you know you was my favorite girl
I always wonder bout you girl
I wonder where you are in this world

See, Sarah, things ain't been the same lately
Like I been putting on lately
Like why you call my phone lately

You acting so, strange, saying you don't know my name
Knowing you know I had game
I told you girl I was on my way

So, Sarah, you know you was my favorite girl
I always wonder bout you girl
I wonder where you are in this world

So, Sarah, you know you was my favorite girl
I always think about you girl
I wonder where you are in this world

Oh, Sarah, you know you was my favorite girl
I always think about you girl
I wonder where you are in this world
