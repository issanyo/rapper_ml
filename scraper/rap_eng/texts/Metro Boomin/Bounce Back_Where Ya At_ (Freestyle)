Chorus x 2
Last night smoked an L but today I wrote raps
Man, I don't sell drugs
But my shit is all crack
Knew my shit was real all the kids be like facts


Verse 1
So you can call me shallow call me asshole
I don't really give a fuck though
Where the cash flow
And you know I got her number
That's the math yo
And I do this in my sleep though
This my nap flow

Wake up wake up wake up wake up
God told me get my cake up
You a lame nigga ain't ya
Still getting fucking tape up's
Talking bout you a day one
And everything you do is A1
You the type to be running your mouth talking shit till I come to your house like say what?
Oh that's what I thought though
Make you lean back Scott storch flow
Give her Keith sweat I want her
She get the seats wet I'll endorse her
And I exercise for endorphins
I stomp your face like I'm marching
Hut 1 hut 2 bitch
I'm the one not you prick
How you let that big tall Spanish nigga smack you
Who?
My dick

Chorus x 2

So last night smoked an L but today I wrote raps
Man I don't sell drugs
But my shit is all crack
Knew my shit was real all the kids be like facts

Verse 2:

I woke up in beast mode
Pockets getting fatter then your chichos
Just in case I don't make it this my
Jaheim flow
Crooked smile at least I brush my fucking teeth though
Toma toma toma toma  
Chug chug  my semen sopa
My hair looking like a mopa (Mapo)
Big bolas maricona
They sleeping on me like a coma
My flow tighter than a goma
And I spit sicker than some vomito
I look and laugh like ju funny bro
I had your girl in a 3 star hotel and put it all in her tummy ohhh
I wasn't supposed to say that
I'm supposed to act like we go way back
I'm the type of nigga to be in the back of the diner yelling out waitress!

Skit:
Where the fuck is my food? (waitress crying)
Get your like together boo boo

Verse 3

Hold up hold up
I fucked a bitch named April
Caught anxiety for no reason  
So I cut her off the next day
She reminded me of tax season
Now it's March and May after February
I'm killing beats where the cemetery?
6 feet yeah that's very scary
I skeet skeet then it's sianora
I'm berry berry sorry that's your daughter
She was screaming duro duro duro


Where your ass was at when I was spitting for the hell of it?
Where your ass what at when I had planet fitness membership?
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the  basement?
Where your ass was at when I was singing on some Trey shit?
(Yeup)
Cause I needed help see undergrad winter classes ain't gon pay themselves
Where your ass was at when I was stressing over Tiffany?
Where your ass was at when I my ass had an epiphany?
Writing in the pad and noticed no one is sick as me (uh)
And that's for sure
