Please don't paint these pictures
I've been in the gym, I've been liftin' money
Metro flippin' money

Got my bitch a lil' codeine, she rock new Celine
Made my dawg a millionaire, what the fuck you mean?
My lil brudda robbed a [?], what the fuck you mean?
Drinkin' lean and poppin' tabs, what the fuck you mean?
Numero uno when I land what the fuck you mean?
Usually I be sippin' purple, I'm on pineapple red
All my family call me Pluto, don't you never forget
Don't be fabricated like I ain't play with the Pyrex
All my family call me Pluto, don't you never forget
Got my bitch [?] ...
