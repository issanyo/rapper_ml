(Chorus)
Keep a roll like it's sushi
Puerto Ricans and Cubans
We in the 'vette making movies
I turned your bitch to a groupie
It ain't my fault that she choosin'
I drop the top and went cruisin'
I drop that bitch like a hooptie
We smokin' shit, turn you stupid
And now we gone, these bitches call my phone
Ain't got the time to deal with her
What you think we playin' cards?
Can't do nuthin' but be real witchu
You fucking with a star
Me and Metro in the building
Bitch you know who we are
Bitch you know who we are

(Verse 1)
Put weed in the Swisher
Fill the whole room with smoke
Big shoutout to your sister she shoved the dick down her throat
So many drugs in my system the kid just might overdose
They feel my presence like Christmas the microphone filled with snow
Bitch I'm the man now
Spit so much heat I need a camo (I do)
So focused that I need a camera (Zoom in)
So many hoes they call me Santa, ha!
It's Zach, baby

(Bridge)
Patiently waitin' to make it
Not to say killers are patient
Easy to tell that they hatin'
Just from the looks on they faces
So many nights in the studio
Blowin' smoke with the Haitians
And this shit levels increasing
I swear my heart steady raising
Just...

(Chorus)
Keep a roll like it's sushi
Puerto Ricans and Cubans
We in the 'vette making movies
I turned your bitch to a groupie
It ain't my fault that she choosin'
I drop the top and went cruisin'
I drop that bitch like a hooptie
We smokin' shit, turn you stupid
And now we gone, these bitches call my phone
Ain't got the time to deal with her
What you think we playin' cards?
Can't do nuttin' but be real witchu
You fucking with a star
Me and Metro in the building
Bitch you know who we are

(Verse 2)
I-I-I took her straight to the top
And left footprints on the moon
I took your bitch to the mall
And they escorted her through
I swear all I do is ball
I turned the mic to a hoop
Can't let no groupie or hater
Come nowhere near me and my groove
Cause I'm the man now
I'm bout to blow in a minute
I see they hands out
But there no more fucks to be given
I need a time bomb
Cuz these folks they know I'm a menace
I smash your hoe, hid my millions
All in her mouth we all did this alone
I had a vision it started back home
And now we here flip that switch and we on
No time for love leave your feelings at home
No turning back cause bitch I'm too far gone

(Chorus)
Keep a roll like it's sushi
Puerto Ricans and Cubans
We in the 'vette making movies
I turned your bitch to a groupie
It ain't my fault that she choosin'
I drop the top and went cruisin'
I drop that bih like a hooptie
We smokin' shit, turn you stupid
And now we gone, these bitches call my phone
Ain't got the time to deal with her
What you think we playin' cards?
Can't do nuttin' but be real witchu
You fucking with a star
Me and Metro in the building
Bitch you know who we are
Bitch you know who we are

(Ooh yeah x6)
