[Intro]
Listen here, Chico
Lesson number one: Never go against the fam

[Hook]
These niggas will destroy you, they ain't loyal
You get money now they acting like they for you
But I don't trust 'em, I say fuck 'em
You not my cuz, you not my brother
That's why I show no love to these snitches
Show no love to these hoes
I ain't tripping off them niggas I know how this game goes
I do by myself, I don't need your help
I do by myself, I only trust myself

[Verse 1]
Look, they say that they be chopping them keys
Shit, I just do not believe
I'm still on the block with my weed
I get you shot up for free
I roll with them dealers and killers
All of my niggas gorillas
Play and they might go bananas
Pull on your block with them hammers
Know that the city can't stand us
They say that we too much handle
The way that we riding them choppers, all the young niggas be thinking we shottas
Fuck niggas know that it's on me
I just might shoot up the police
It's real in the field, kill or be killed
I might as well blow 'fore they smoke me

[Hook]
These niggas from the struggle, they ain't loyal
You get money now they acting like they for you
But I don't trust 'em, I say fuck 'em
You not my cuz, you not my brother
That's why I show no love to these snitches
Show no love to these hoes
I ain't tripping off them niggas, I know how this game goes
I do by myself, I don't need your help
I do by myself, I only trust myself

[Verse 2]
I do not fuck with these niggas
Can't show no love to these niggas
Can't put no trust in these bitches as soon as she leave and I'm fucking her sister
You wanna cuddle and kiss her
I'm just gon' fuck her and ditch her
You not might Gucci that bitch
Kick that hoe out of your whip
Niggas gon' say that they you bro
Niggas gon' they say that they love you
Then when you need 'em the most
These niggas turn into ghosts
Better not go to no jail
They ain't gonna send you no mail
They ain't got shit for you loyal
They ain't got shit on your bail

[Hook]
These niggas from the struggle, they ain't loyal
You get money now they acting like they for you
But I don't trust 'em, I say fuck 'em
You not my cuz, you not my brother
That's why I show no love to these snitches
Show no love to these hoes
I ain't tripping off them niggas, I know how this game goes
I do by myself, I don't need your help
I do by myself, I only trust myself

[Outro]
Hey I don't trust no one of you fucking cockroaches, no new friend
Tell that bitch she can beat it like Michael Jackson
Dig what I'm saying?
They will destroy you
In the streets is every man for himself, man, remember that man
Everybody tryna find a way
