Intro:
(Young Thug)
Racks on top yo' head and then I'm through wit it
Thugger, ey, thugger thug
Shitro, YSL

Chorus:
(Young Thug)
I drop them bands on top of yo' head
And then I'm thru' wit it!
Shitro ran'd up so many racks
I think he Jewish-rich!
I'm not no rat
But I came straight up out that sewer shit
Viper trucks and amazing (?)
Little kids say
"you a chick" (you)
I thank my gang from the east coast
Up to the west coast

(Bricc Baby Shitro)
We don't mail in them packs
We just traffic bricks from the Leer

(Young Thug)
Yes, Thugger I'm more crazy than {name}

(Bricc Baby Shitro)
VVS' like water, glaciers
Chain like chandelier!

Verse 1:
(Young Thug)
Tony Tiger, my life's fire
Made millions off cypher
She a girl and I might spice her
Cut it, yea I dice her

(Bricc Baby Shitro)
Tell her to bring her best friend
And I'ma have her dyking
If I'm leaning like kickstand
I'ma one-night her

(Young Thug)
Chillin' on boat like I'm Gilligan
I'm not talking lake but
I am a fisherman
I got a habit with siblings
I fuck all their mother, their sister
Their cousin and..

(Bricc Baby Shitro)
I got your whole life
In a duffel bag
I'm Jewish-rich
In a bucket hat
We put in the bricks of Leers
My backyard
Came with a helipad

(Young Thug)
Get away from my thing
I got a bomb again
You sh-should've known
A nigga come and go
Remove your panties, ho
Before you whip the blow
No animal
Got donkey on a camel toe


Chorus:
(Young Thug)
I drop them bands on top of yo' head
And then I'm thru' wit it
Shitro ran'd up so many racks
I think he Jewish-rich!
I'm not no rat
But I came straight up out that sewer shit
Viper trucks and amazing (?)
Little kids say
"you a chick" (you)
I thank my gang from the east coast
Up to the west coast

(Bricc Baby Shitro)
We don't mail in them packs
We just traffic bricks from the Leer

(Young Thug)
Yes, Thugger I'm more crazy than {name}

(Bricc Baby Shitro)
VVS' like water, glaciers
Chain like chandelier!

Verse 2:
(Bricc Baby Shitro)
I drop a couple bands
Then I'm thru' wit it!
Them tiny loafs
So start some
I'm gon' act a fool wit it
(Ole!)

(Young Thug)
Young Shitty
Let that lil' nigga
Come to me
I swear that I want him
Make him play headbutt
With bullets

(Bricc Baby Shitro)
Woo
He gon' die
Soon as I pull it!
Rudolph-top semis
All of my niggas
Talk fullies!

(Young Thug)
We catch him down back
Then we slide him
We hommie, double-back
And hide him
You turn your back on me
I'll spine you
You pussies are pussy, vaginas

(Bricc Baby Shitro)
Trap 'em up
No Benihana's
I ride with
A gang of Piranhas
Thirty-round clip
In the llama
You owe me
I pop at your mama

(Young Thug)
I'm ready to run Mississipi
The killers and hippies
Are with me
Your slime in the 60's was shitty
One month with us
You have no kidneys

Chorus:
(Young Thug)
I drop them bands on top of yo' head
And then I'm thru' wit it!
Shitro ran'd up so many racks
I think he Jewish-rich!
I'm not no rat
But I came straight up out that sewer shit
Viper trucks and amazing (?)
Little kids say
"you a chick" (you)
I thank my gang from the east coast
Up to the west coast

(Bricc Baby Shitro)
