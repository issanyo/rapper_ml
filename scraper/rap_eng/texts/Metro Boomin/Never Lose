(Southside!)
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga!)

[Chorus:]
Tell me, choose, them or you?
That was something I would never do
I'm just someone new, it's something new
Me and Metro will never lose
You fuck niggas way too comfortable
You pussy niggas way too comfortable
You lame hoes way too comfortable
When the change post to get comfortable [?]
Tell me, choose, them or you?
That was something I would never do
I'm just someone new, it's something new
Me and Southside will never lose
You fuck niggas way too comfortable
You pussy niggas way too comfortable
You lame hoes way too comfortable
When the change post to get comfortable [?]

[Verse 1:]
I know my rights
We have the right to remain silent
Money, drugs, nigga, gang violence
OGs made us pay homage
Pussy niggas ain't want no problem
Dirty dollars got us foreign cars
Nigga, low mileage
You don't wanna need a cosigner
We the one that carry the cash out
We the one that brought the racks out
200 in the stash house
500 at the last house
(200 on the dash now)
Milked the game, I'm a cash cow
Pourin fours til I pass out
I take the green like Notre Dame
Cut up the dope with lidocaine
Young nigga that know the game
Made my heart numb, novacaine
Novacaine, novacaine, and I ain't never change
Never change, stay down, always stayed the same
Even when all the paper came
Because a chain [?]
We never got comfortable

[Chorus:]
Tell me, choose, them or you?
That was something I would never do
I'm just someone new, it's something new
Me and Metro will never lose
You fuck niggas way too comfortable
You pussy niggas way too comfortable
You lame hoes way too comfortable
When the change post to get comfortable [?]
Tell me, choose, them or you?
That was something I would never do
I'm just someone new, it's something new
Me and Southside will never lose
You fuck niggas way too comfortable
You pussy niggas way too comfortable
You lame hoes way too comfortable
When the change post to get comfortable [?]

[Verse 2:]
Pillow talkin, talkin down, all smiles when I come around
I'mma hit em with a TEC (prrrrrr), cause all these niggas foul
Even worse then these bitches now
Pointed fingers turn to trigger fingers
Aw man, y'all some funny niggas
Aw damn, y'all some funny niggas
You thought we was local
I knew you was local
Go tell em we global
And never got comfortable
Back then we ain't have a choice
Back then we ain't have a voice
Now we the ones that they listen to
Every move is a bigger move
Tell me choose, them or you?
I made it up in my mind
I had to swallow my pride
I look you right in the eyes
That was something I would never do
Change crews or betray you
Same team, nigga, win or lose
And we never got comfortable

[Hook:]
Tell me, choose, them or you?
That was something I would never do
I'm just someone new, it's something new
Me and Metro will never lose
You fuck niggas way too comfortable
You pussy niggas way too comfortable
You lame hoes way too comfortable
When the change post to get comfortable [?]
Tell me, choose, them or you?
That was something I would never do
I'm just someone new, it's something new
Me and Southside will never lose
You fuck niggas way too comfortable
You pussy niggas way too comfortable
You lame hoes way too comfortable
When the change post to get comfortable [?]
