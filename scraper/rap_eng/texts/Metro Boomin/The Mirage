[Intro - Alan Abelew, Marlon Wayans, Nikko Bunkin & Young Thug]
Very interesting, uh, I see your hobbies are drinking, smoking weed, and all types of ill shit. Yeah. Uh, do you drive an automobile? With or without the boop? It doesn't matter, well congratulations, you got yourself a job

Nikko Bunkin in the trap

Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Verse 1]
Bitch catch me up inside the new mirage
How 'bout that another cause
Making beats in my garage
Man I flourish from my sales
Money stacking to the top
You'll never understand
Yeah, your job is giving top

[Pre-Chorus]
This beat is la familia
I'm vibin' with the views
If I wasn't up here rapping then you'd think this really views
But it ain't, real news
Inspired by the muse
Yeah I'm playing like a child
Metro Boomin on the dial (yeah)

[Chorus 1]
Don't make me bring you back to the hood
No exaggeration
These are blessings from the hood
I just don't understand
All the methods that you could
Were your plans to always lie and to act like you were good? (Wait)

[Verse 2]
This here deception, it calls for only two
Two can play your games and never have a clue
But I'm not like every other ordinary normal guy
You can't play your games around me only thing I ask is why (Hi)
Yeah know that I don't fuck with all of that
I can't even say I fuck with you
You act like such a hood rat
You've changed your whole appearance
I can't even recognize you
I can't even get my clearance
Or even walk beside you

[Pre-Chorus]
This beat is la familia
I'm vibin' with the views
If I wasn't up here rapping then you'd think this really views
But it ain't, real news
Inspired by the muse
Yeah I'm playing like a child, on the dial (Man)
This beat is la familia
I'm vibin' with the views
If I wasn't up here rapping then you'd think this really views
But it ain't, real news
Inspired by the muse
Yeah I'm playing like a child
Metro Boomin on the dial (Man)

[Chorus 2]
Don't make me seal your fate like I could
Don't make me seal your fate all for good
No exaggeration
I could end it all for good
I could end that stupid pain
That I'm feeling every day (Woah)

[Outro]
Bitch catch me up inside my new garage
In the mirage
Hidden in the back of the mirage
My studio's behind the new mirage (Yeah)
(To whom it may concern for my message)
Yeah, get my message
To the mirage
Bitch catch me up inside the new mirage (Woah)
