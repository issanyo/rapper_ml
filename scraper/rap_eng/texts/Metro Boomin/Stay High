[Hook]
The pain from the bros that I lost
Turned me into a fuckin' boss
Bumpin 6 tryna turn it to a 9
Work touch back every time
That work touch, we stretch it every time
Fuck that shit, we need every dime
Free my niggas doing fed time
Said free my niggas doing fed time
No checkers, this is chess nigga
In this shit gotta use your mind
In this shit gotta stay alive
In this shit til the day I die
Poured a 5 in my 20 oz
Call this shit a 25
Seen so much in my life
Every day gotta stay high

[Verse 1]
Circle smaller than crumb
Seen so many switch sides
Niggas try beefin with us
Guaranteed he gon' die
We just tryna live it up
We ain't worried bout you other guys
We just tryna live it up
We ain't worried bout you other guys
Nigga want beef with us, better believe it come with fries
When I say “...it come with fries” that means it’s homicide
Homicide, niggas gon die, pull up do a drive by
We’ll hop out, let that hammer fry
Ion give a fuck if it’s daytime!

[Break]
I’m just a young nigga sellin pies (x3)
In this shit tryna get by
I’m just a young nigga sellin pies (x3)
In this shit, in this shit tryna get by

[Verse 2]
Finessing turned to a hobby
Finesse my plug with the robbery
Servin' fiends in the lobby
Servin' fiends wit my llama
They don’t know nuthin bout me
Pussy niggas tried to doubt me
Bet yo bitch hop in when I pull up in that ‘Rarri
In the trap turning the white whippin up a new Bugatti
Nigga hand out but where were they when I was starvin'?
Shit crazy...
I’m bout to go retarded

[Hook]
The pain from the bros that I lost
Turned me into a fuckin' boss
Bumpin 6 tryna turn it to a 9
Work touch back every time
That work touch, we stretch it every time
Fuck that shit, we need every dime
Free my niggas doing fed time
Said free my niggas doing fed time
No checkers, this is chess nigga
In this shit gotta use your mind
In this shit gotta stay alive
In this shit til the day I die
Poured a 5 in my 20 oz
Call this shit a 25
Seen so much in my life
Every day gotta stay high
