I just leveled up and got my paper straight
Movin thru the shadows mystic wizard in some bathing ape
Great
I got paid today
Runnin shit
I stay in shape
Xanax and the Molly hit the blunt and then i fade away
Galactic captain I'm rappin and makin Magic happen
Dramatic fashion wrapping cabbage you can check my status
Hit the gas I'm feeling like the black Aladdin
Cashin out they super broke we laughin at em

Annunaki blood I can't not trust you niggas
Fake it till you make it y'all ain't fuckin wit Us
Feasting on these beats for breakfast lunch  and dinner
That's why I wake up every mornin hit a hundred sit ups

Can't sweat my fresh
God damn saint James got checks on deck
Gotta go get it can't rest can't rest
Till I'm ridin thru my city in a SLS
Yes
Can't clip my wings
Elevatin when im wit my team
Burnin cash man i live my dreams
Chillin with the angels like this my scene

Speed of light I'm cruisin thru the atmosphere
Kundalini risin to the sky i brought the dragon here
Floatin thru the Ether makin sure that every path is clear
Trustin in myself and makin music so my dad can hear

But he dead tho
So i ressurect him with this rare flow
If you talk to demons be careful
Cuz they trickin' niggas like a scarecrows
Yikes!
We cold as ice
Im turnin heads like a poltergeist
Own the mic man you know he nice
Im On vacation
Gotta show each night

Jumpman stuntman i dont do no michael jordans
Jumpman stuntman u can keep your michaels kors's
Jumpman stuntman i dont need polo horses

They stagin riots just so they can gentrify!

California dreamin burnin sour grapes
All we smoke is loud you can hear it from
A mile away
Thought that i was done till i hit em with the power play
Flow so pyroclastic freestyle for like an hour straight


Fuck the propoganda i control myself
Investin and finessin tryna grow my wealth
Full speed ahead i never slow my step
2047 they'll be no one left
