[Intro]
Metro in this muthafucka nigga
I don't need no autotune for this, ya heard me
Freeband gang
(The coolest DJ in the world)

[Verse 1]
Stress all in a nigga shoulders, feel it in my backbone
Trials and tribulations taking the pain with an advil
Rich gang la familia, last night was mad real
Texts in my phone playing jealousy and hatred, misery loves company
But I'm going on vacation, put the herb on rotation, you bite the hand that feed you
You can take a nigga heart but you can't the mind
I got the braincells of a billionaire, I wake up and fly anywhere, fly nigga anywhere
It's Klein-Davis, I'm fucking up club sofas
With my [?] bustin roaches with ashes on ashes
Spaceships and stars, I see snakes in the yard but I can deal with 'em
These bitches eat pussy better than me, I choke her while I fuck her, can't nobody do it like me
(Yeah she know dat)
Callin' this hoe my girl had to be on Molly and E
What the fuck I was on man? I'm tripping off that good codeine and kush
Fuckin' up [?] Imma' keep it on pushing cause it ain't fuckin' up my limits
Turn my weakness into strength, now forever scripting
Let a hoe ride first class put your shit in the bentley, man what's goin' on?
Put my codeine on swishers
Fuck it I love it, I taste it
It's so strange, but it make the pain go away, (DJ ESCO), it make the pain go away
When you frustrated cause you been a good nigga, when you was a crook nigga tryna' play it by the book nigga
And got played by a crook, nigga, it ain't easy at it look nigga
But God got his eyes on me
Like Whitney on the track
I will always love you for having me recognize the reality of karma
Future Hendrix

[Outro]
You runnin' low on drank nigga
Right now you in a movie
