[Intro]
Ya knooww...
I went all the way to Canada
But had to come back because Somebody told me their might be a round two in the election
So all i gotta say is
If they cheated boy we need a round 2
Hey!

[Chorus]
Rain drop,(drip) drop top(drop top)
Trump got the dub and my heart stopped (dub)
Russia tried to help thats a plot plot(plot)
Cooking up votes in a foreign spot (spot)
He went from business to presendential(hey)
Trump tower, white house now residential(white)
Call up the russians theyll come and get you (gang)
Politics tripping this is an issue(hey)
My president bad and bougee (bad)
Cooking up votes with vlad putin (bloaw)
The Donald is savage ruthless (craazy)(hey!)
If he cheated we need a round two x2(rrahh)

[Verse 2]
Pour up for straight justice, politics, can't trust it
Introduce ya to a party democratic, republican
Broke it all down, bout da money, why they acting funny
Don't vote too fast, I might shoot ya (huh?)
Super bad and boujee (super)
Why can’t we all be just neutral (love)
Stead of fighting becoming secluded (alone)
They told me im living in wonderland, call me Nwosu in a movie
Told me can’t happen I'm stupid (can’t happen)
Laughed and I told I'm cupid (funny)
Change on my mind it’s a movement (change)
Uniting people through this type of music
I pull up, I pull up, I pull up, I hop out with all of the love they just mop up (skrrt)
I’m cooking, I’m cooking, I’m whipping, I’m whipping
Won’t stop, till da badies get locked up (lock up)
I told em relax, I come with no violence, no need to call all the cops up, (chill)
These people they lie, and they slick, and busting for money man getting caught up
Ya that way, swaying the votes like Beyoncé
Ya that way, Can’t even vote cause my birthplace
Ya that way, young man just trying to make headway
Ya that way, won't stop till I get the whole world say
