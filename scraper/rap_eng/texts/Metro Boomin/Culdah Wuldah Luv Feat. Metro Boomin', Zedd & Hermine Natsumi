We don’t need a conversation
I’m not here to try to change your mind
Keep my hoodie, you can take it
I’m just - dropping by to see if you’re alright
Heard you found yourself a new friend
I’m not jealous, he’s just not your type
Did you mean what you were saying
Don’t have to answer, I’m just saying

I know we’ve been here before
Maybe a couple of times
But I was stupid for what I did
For making you cry
Took you for granted, what else
I only thought of myself
I got everything I got, except you

I go crazy just thinking bout ya
Shuldah culdah wuldah luv
On the daily just wondering what
I shuldah culdah wuldah done
Cause you stood by me through whatever
And I culdah treated you better
I go crazy just thinking bout ya
My shuldah culdah wuldah luv


Ohhh, ohhh
My shuldah culdah wuldah luv
Ohhh, ohhh

I like it better when you talk less
Got some nerve for you to show up here
Tryna get all up in my head
Boy I thought I made it crystal clear, if ya
Really miss me, who’s that new chick
Tell me how that’s supposed to make me feel
How’d this get so complicated
I didn’t mean what I was saying

You know I hate to admit
I can’t get you off my mind
But you were stupid for what I did
One too many times
Took me for granted, what else
You only thought of yourself
And I hate I can’t get over you

I go crazy just thinking bout ya
Shuldah culdah wuldah luv
On the daily just wondering what
I shuldah culdah wuldah done
Cause you stood by me through whatever
And I coulda treated you better

Me and here were stupid tight
Said I luv you once or twice
Around 12 - rang the bell
And we had a Mayweather fight
Started bout a week ago
Tears and crying on the phone
Said she heard about me talking to some other chick named so and so
Truth is that’s a lie
I am faithful in relationships
Shorty’s like my high school hallway
Cause she’s walked through quite a bit
If I really luv her like no other gotta let her know
Put a shuldah culdah wuldah on the record cause I go
