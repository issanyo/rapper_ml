Wavy K they like to label me as a musician
Show the culture that I really respect the tradition
Some love to see that I got some ambition
Others hate to see that I'm not stuck in prison
Third eye wide but sometimes it needs a rest and
That's when I switch it up to a tunnel vision
My debut mixtape was way more than an audition
Zen even said "homie you killed the competition" (x2)

[Verse]
First things first I really do miss my brother
I recognize he's above me looking over my shoulder
Everyday guiding me as I grow older
I'm taking steps forward like I'm a foot soldier
Twenty Seventeen I'm making my contention as a lyricist
Up there with Brady and Shady nobody else is nearing this
But if you beef with me I'ma even the score equally
Think you can compete with me
I'll shatter your dreams frequently

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse]
Yo please release my homie OG Bobby Brav
He's got my six man just like he always has
The youngest OG used to continuously bump my shit
Whenever I saw him he constantly gave me rips
Told Highzen in the near future I'ma march into the madness
What a time to be alive since these women are the baddest
What a time to be alive since I got to flex with Joey Badass
With ease I rip trees if there's a problem that's the solution
My main Mary Jane there's no other substitution
The highest strains got me one of the brightest brains
I'm feelin' like I'm the industry's Cy Young
Cause I'ma always go the distance and won't ever die young
Stay Wavy

[Hook] (x1)
