[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Okay, you know I’m with it, yeah
On every mission you know we ain’t missin', yeah
And you know we havin' ammunition, know my finger itchin'
Know I keep that pistol on me like it’s a tradition
I swear we barely had a pot to piss in, we were barely livin'
We were tryna get it, anybody get it
Yeah, now we havin' a whole lot of ammunition, yeah
Now we havin' a whole lot of hammers with me, yeah

[Verse 1: YFN Trae Pound]
Okay, that Draco with that drum will leave a nigga numb, huh
Hundred rounds get it done, all kinds of guns, huh
Like a pawn shop, thought I was with Jay the way my trunk rocked up
Big cuzz, cook it up, he say it’s all locked up
All heavy artillery, very high up at the embassy
The paralyzed feelin' me
Who is he? Pound the fliest nigga in town
Play ‘round with me at 12, by 3 he was found
Two, two, three take a tree down, we smoke a tree down
Let your bitch catch my kids, yeah, that’s a rebound
Caught her on the rebound

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Might smoke a pound with Pound
A hundred rounds outta town
Like fifty thou' for my crown
I told him, boy, better not play son
Get your face done
All black, looking like Akon
With more than eight guns
Said these bullets bigger than Faizon
Livin' wet as a pond
Pull out that problem, give 'em somethin' to hate on
My nigga 'bout to beat the trial, yeah, they gon' hate on 'em
And if I want you dead, I get my boys to lay on 'em
Where I come from, niggas got a lot of hunger
If you got it, they gon' want you
So you gotta keep it on you

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Okay, you know I’m with it, yeah
On every mission you know we ain’t missin', yeah
And you know we havin' ammunition, know my finger itchin'
Know I keep that pistol on me like it’s a tradition
I swear we barely had a pot to piss in, we were barely livin'
We were tryna get it, anybody get it
Yeah, now we havin' a whole lot of ammunition, yeah
Now we havin' a whole lot of hammers with me, yeah

[Verse 3: YFN Lucci & YFN Trae Pound]
Drum, Draco holdin' a drum, nigga, we got plenty drums
Two, two, three got drums, nigga
We pull up with drums, where you from, nigga?
Yeah, if you ain’t from 'round here, you better not come, nigga, yeah
Balmain with them shines in 'em, know we ridin' with 'em
Probably never ride rental, only if we slidin' in ‘em, yeah
We got so many Glocks, three fifty-seven blocks
Three fifty-seven pops and everybody drops
You already know what’s happenin', hoe
Pull up with like twenty MACS like we robbed the Apple Store
Fill a nigga up with the pump like we in Amoco
Rapper of the year, slayin' trapper of the year, I get that pack, it disappear
Uh, see this the fastest one right here
And I don’t like to front, but yeah, my engine in the rear
If I get mentioned, then you killed
Big fence around the crib, I got your pension in my ear
Keep your distance, I don’t feel ya
Ayy, Pound got that AR and that R8
Know I’m in that i8 with that 308, don’t violate
Broad day, shootout broad day, we can go all day
I go to sleep, wake up the same way

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Okay, you know I’m with it, yeah
On every mission you know we ain’t missin', yeah
And you know we havin' ammunition, know my finger itchin'
Know I keep that pistol on me like it’s a tradition
I swear we barely had a pot to piss in, we were barely livin'
We were tryna get it, anybody get it
Yeah, now we havin' a whole lot of ammunition, yeah
Now we havin' a whole lot of hammers with me, yeah

[Outro: YFN Lucci]
Drum, Draco holdin' a drum, nigga, we got plenty drums
Two, two, three got drums, nigga
We pull up with drums, where you from, nigga?
We pull up with drums, where you from, nigga?
