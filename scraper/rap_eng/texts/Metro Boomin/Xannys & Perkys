[Hook: K08]
King of this shit who gon stop me outta here
Learned from the best that's me by the way
I don't give a fuck what a Meek got to say
I'm the man working out my 6th ring by the way
Niggas acting tuff that's a flag on the play
30 like curry what I average a day
I can take yo bitch scoop her up like yeah
Bougie women only no cash no play
Saw her in the lounge so I took that score
Great drive to the rim now we rushin out the door
She ain't never fucked with rockstar before
Took her home dicked her down now she my bitch of course
She know what she want what she need is for certain
She tweaking her knees never hurt fuck the
Curtain
She told me skeet off on her titties on purpose
Off xannys & perkys I see that they working

[Verse 1: K08]
You got what you wanted it's too much to handle
Slide to ya crib then pull off in a rental
I'm in my own lane it's right in the middle
Laugh to the bank niggas thought I was mental
You stupid for thinking we both sentimental
I thought that would change as soon as I met you
But back to this game that niggas invented
We try to get settled & then it's forget it
Fuck up these checks if I want it I get it
Price does not matter I'm willing to spend it
I like what I see then I willingly get it
My girl fly too she got her own percentage
She stack up on her own
She don't need a nigga debit
Make my first M Ima turn tht shit to credit
I am independence shit what can I say
How u ask me for a feature but u ain't tryna pay
What you fuck niggas on
Make one call & you fuck niggas gone
Have my lil sister get u fucked niggas lined
That's a great way to get a fuck nigga drawn
Check mate bitch all you fuck niggas Pawns
Whoodie that's the lango got it written on my arm
Pistol on my east all my niggas on the west
If you coming near my side u should prolly wear a vest
Got my girl face south but her ass up north
My whole team going up like the cash up North
& we ain't looking back til the cash on Storch
If you ain't fucking wit me then ya ass off course
Fuck boys tight cuz I'm living my life
My bitch bad & her body set nice
She a flirt flirt flirt grabbed my piece like twice
Need the work work work got it for the best price

[Bridge x2: K08]
Thats outta sight man that's outta mind
Got hate for u niggas I don't gotta lie
Got love for ya bitches but ya outta time
Double cup poing up then I mix the line
