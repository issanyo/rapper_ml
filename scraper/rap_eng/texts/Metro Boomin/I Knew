& I ain't never been the one to start to fall down
But when you dig yourself a hole you got to crawl out
Picture me living like a peasant in a small house
To waking up in mansions because the night before we balled out
& yeah, can't be scared of this shit at all
You try fighting with the devil & waking up with some scares
Bitch I might have lost the battle
But never could lose the war
Bitch I need a little space if y'all want me to be a star

I do
Did everything I said that I would do
I knew
One day I'd be on top just like the roof
Without you
God told me that he blessed me from the start
Now Im sleep with foreign women, hearing voices in my car

You are quiet I speed major
I remember the day , nigga place a wage
Get folded off but it plays you
Ive been on the streets since Ive been rocking pages
I want it all
You keep it here
And if you dont you might wanna leave
Lets make it clear
Lift your smile
I got to show a story
And I didnt hit the goal

Bitch I might have lost the battle
But never lose the war
Bitch I need a little space if you want me to be a star

Id do for everything I said that I would do
I knew
One day Ill be on charge its true
You told me that you blessed me from the start
Now Im sleeping and Im hearing voices in my car

Bitch Im staking it like Im a telephone
I be so damn high I'm starting to think I need some feathers on
I said I be so damn fly I'm starting to think I need to carry home
Can't get these bitches off me starting to think I'm made of pheromones
Cant get rid of me
Im here to stay until they send me home

Bitch I might have lost the battle
But never lose the war
Bitch I need a little space if you want me to be a star

Id do for everything I said that I would do
I knew
One day Ill be on charge its true
You told me that you blessed me from the start
Now Im sleeping and Im hearing voices in my car
Cause I knew
Cause I knew
Cause I knew
Cause I knew
Cause I knew
Yes I knew
I knew
I knew
