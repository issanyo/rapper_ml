[Intro: Young Thug]
Young Scooter, yeah
Young Jeffery, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?
I get it, I dig it, yeah
Let's get it

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'ma keep some bands on me, yeah dawg (yeah, dawg)
I'm just tryna get my bread on (bread on)
I'm with Mally Mall and we got plenty homes (Mally Mall)
Ballin' with my team, I don't ball hog, hey, hey
Cash on your friend if she cock block, ayy, ayy
Ballin' with my friends, Margiela
Niggas servin' ki's, daily
Run it up, stop callin'
Run up you some bands, nigga stop callin'
I just wrapped some birds, nigga stop the callin'
Servin' out the van at that corner store
Catch me whippin' up the bands, money callin'

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Run it up, run it up, run it up
It'll go up and down like push ups
Ten thou' in each pot
That's 40 thou' to cook up (whip)
I got Falcons and Hawks
All my birds remixed up (remix)
Chris Tucker, money talks
Play with me, get hit up (count up)
All my diamonds lit up (woo!)
Eliantte, woo (water)
I just bought a helicopter, yacht and a coupe
It ain't got no roof (nah)
I do what bosses do (check)
I got on special made Jordans, five thousand a shoe (jugg!)
I'ma keep them bands like a drummer, dawg (jugg!)
Gave the plug to my niggas, I don't ball hog (hog)
Yeah I got a lot of haters, but fuck all y'all (fuck 'em)
Onyx, Magic and Follie's, done fucked all y'all (Scooter!)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'ma keep some bands on me, yeah dawg (yeah, dawg)
I'm just tryna get my bread on (bread on)
I'm with Mally Mall and we got plenty homes (Mally Mall)
Ballin' with my team, I don't ball hog, hey, hey
Cash on your friend if she cock block, ayy, ayy
Ballin' with my friends, Margiela
Niggas servin' ki's, daily
Run it up, stop callin'
Run up you some bands, nigga stop callin'
I just wrapped some birds, nigga stop the callin'
Servin' out the van at that corner store
Catch me whippin' up the bands, money callin'

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
The cook up, the cook up, the cook up
The cook up, the cook up, the cook
The cook up, the cook up, the cook up
The cook up, the cook up, the cook up, the cook
The cook up, the cook up, the cook up
The cook up, the cook up, the cook up
You take you a pot, and you take you some folks
They cook up, they cook up, they cook up
Who cook it the best? (Slatt, slatt)
Who do it, may flush? (Do it, may flush)
Who give away the crust?
Whose diamonds is flooded?
There go 12, flush (flush)
Escape out the sheriff bus (woo)
Young nigga gettin' rich, that's a must
No deodorant

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'ma keep some bands on me, yeah dawg (yeah, dawg)
I'm just tryna get my bread on (bread on)
I'm with Mally Mall and we got plenty homes (Mally Mall)
Ballin' with my team, I don't ball hog, hey, hey
Cash on your friend if she cock block, ayy, ayy
Ballin' with my friends, Margiela
Niggas servin' ki's, daily
