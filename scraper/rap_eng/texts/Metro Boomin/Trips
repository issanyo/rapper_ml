[Intro]
Let them kill me
Why live in a world where
The people can be named
With the word "hypocrisy"

This world is full of things
As absurd as wars provoked
By differences of religions or presidents
Who don't even know speak

People talk about expression freedom
But probably someone
Will punish you for
Expressing yourself freely

Everyone laugh at you
Every day
No one takes you seriously
Their bullshit surpasses you

Those persons, who have money
Get more money
But those who lack money
Have more problems and expenses

Yeah, this is our world

[Verse 1]
I be tripping, and finding troubles in my way
Rolling up swishers and playing with K
A bit psychedelic, it doesn't make sense
Bobber, purple dripping, dropping in my hand

Oh, doom, dex on my dew
Yeah, go into my room
Yeah, fuck into my room
Yeah, dance on the Moon

Killer pick up that Glock
And go shot the cops
They haven't got mind
You haven't got gun

[Hook]
I be dancing with the nightmares in my trips
Go roll up all this backwoods in my tree
Smoke up this backwoods, it's all I need
Need the feed, light that Bic
[x2]

[Verse 2]
Yeah

Coordinate
Once she let
She be late
She doesn't like the day

I was like
The reckless
Rest In peace
For ages

Waiting, beeing patient
Never basics, lazy, stressing
Taking naps finessing
Shout out to my dresser

Dexter, better find me awaking
Prob I'm making wake and baking
Tryna figure, tryna make it
Gotta get it on my braking

Akinator, guessing what I'm saying
When I 'm talking bout' the selling
Rental automatic, I be planning
Dexing, popping xannies

[Hook]
I be dancing with the nightmares in my trips
Go roll up all this backwoods in my tree
Smoke up this backwoods, it's all I need
Need the feed, light that Bic
[x2]

[Verse 3]
No, no, no
No, you cannot blame me
No, no, no
No, you cannot blame me

Bad hoe
Feeling like Kardashian
Know no Kanye
But she's dating

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's tripping on me faded
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hope I can leave you rather

Yeah

[Hook]
I be dancing with the nightmares in my trips
Go roll up all this backwoods in my tree
Smoke up this backwoods, it's all I need
Need the feed, light that Bic
[x2]
