[Verse 1]
Now first of all where I'm supposed to start
When I first met you man another nigga had your heart
But, I'ma player so you know a playa played his part
Smooth talkin', conversation took a nigga broad
I'm on the road doin' shows, seem like we fell apart
She think a nigga fuckin' groupies, I'm just grindin' hard
Your family said we wouldn't last, but we beat the odds
Bonnie and Clyde, she was with a nigga stealin' cars
These streets so dirty, I just want someone who really there
Can't fake love, I just want someone who really care
Be loyal to me, want somebody I ain't gotta share
Open your eyes, baby girl, real niggas rare
All my dog ways, had to put 'em in a kennel
I'm a savage to these niggas, but to her I'm gentle
I'm a savage to these niggas, but to her I'm gentle
I'm just sippin' on this mud, you was on my mental

[Hook]
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air

[Verse 2]
I can feel it in the air, I'ma grab her by her hair
I'ma fuck her like a bear, I'ma fuck her like a bear
Red bottoms on her, yeah
Buy her Gucci, Fendi, yeah
She too stiff on niggas, yeah
She gon' make these niggas stare
I'ma fuck her with no condom
I'ma let her meet my momma
I'ma take her out that Honda
I'ma put her in the foreign
Spoiled, she ain't got no patience
She gon' have these bitches hatin'
Got them diamonds on me skatin'
Got them diamonds on her skatin'
Everywhere we go we clean
She want me to quit that lean
Baby, I can't quit that lean
Put a ring around codeine
Everywhere we go we clean
She want me to quit that lean
Baby, I can't quit that lean
Put a ring around codeine

[Hook]
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air
