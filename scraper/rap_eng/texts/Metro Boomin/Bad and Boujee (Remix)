[Verse: Dre The Weirdo]
Weirdo (x5)
My bars so cold like Sub Zero
F.O.D. getting dinero
Fuck saving hoes, not a hero
Watch my back Slim, let me reload
At yo direction, we gonna blow
Then the squad leave, just like vama nos!
My bitches be bad and boujee
Two bitches in my jacuzzi
Let's get naked, shoot a movie
Curry clip, shoot you like movies
Woah (x2)
Just took a fuck nigga hoe
Squad with me, always on go
Try me put you in death row
Easy shot like a free throw
(Pah! Pah! Pah! Pah!)
Easy shot like a free throw
(Pah! Pah! Pah!)
Mars walking, outer space
F.O.D. we in the place
Boomin, Metro with the bass
Smoke gas with my nigga Nate
Sick with my flows
Sick of these dumb hoes
Do I love you? Hell no
Fuck you one night let you go
Pass you off to the bro
Kwam from Jersey, he say yo
What we serving? Yayo
Oh hehe... yeah you know
Back to the basics
We count benji faces
We sprint, you be pacing
Why the hell's you hating
Don't be mad, just get it
Stack it up, don't spend it
On some rims, I spend it
Good mouth game so splendid
Hold up...
Who that is out the door?
Oh shit
12 out the door!
12 out the door!
Woo (x2)
That was such a close call
Dream team yeah we ball
Got this crack, serve it all
What (x6)
Bitch you not even that bad
Hustle, getting to the bag
We gang but we don't need a flag
Ooh (x2)
All this sauce drip on yo bitch
She gone fuck me and the clique
On worldstar she get famous so quick
Need cash go out and go hit a lick
On the hip, yeah I keep me a stick
From a quarter wow to a brick
Whole team taking trips
Travel fast, UFO
Bad and boujee, that's fasho
Come with me, let's ride fasho
Are you down? She down fasho

[Verse: Slim Count]
OG (x5)
Call me a cab, instead a Uber
Called up my plug and my jeweler
I gas up and shine at the same time
Young nigga flex like Aruba
Fucking your bitch, she so clueless
You get out of line, that's your medulla
Dominican bitch overseas
Stacking up racks, I got cheese
Jump from the stage, to the crowd
Now I'm living like a dream (F.O.D.!)
It's dripping so let's make it rain
Your bitch got educated brain
Niggas don't understand the struggle
I swear to God it be that pain
All black Hummer, ruthless aggression
Danny Glover, Lethal Weapon
Janoris Jenkins, catching them plays
Intercepting all them motherfucking chickens
Read that lil nigga a book, aye
Call that shit Charles Dickens
I just stick to the g-code
Fucking your bitch, she on Henny
John Wick, one gun shot to the head
Now he a dead man
Now he a headless dead man
Tryna gas for some (?)
Trap full of that pack
We don't negotiate with rats
Call me Ray Allen with the three
Tell them Slim Count got next
