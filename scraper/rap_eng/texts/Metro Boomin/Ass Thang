[Intro]
Yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Metro, Metro, Metro, Metro, Metro, Metro
If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1]
I don't play, I need my cake
Colder than a winter day
Bitch, I keep a dirty K (21, 21, 21, 21)
Shawty got a fat ass
Say she like the way I swag
Might just buy the bitch a bag (Bag, bag, bag, bag)
Yellow Xan', taste a [?] (What?)
Smokin' on a pound of gas
Pussy nigga make me laugh (Hah), laugh (Hah, hah, hah)
Bitch, I like to get that cash
Do you like to get that cash?
Lil' bitch, then we can get some cash (Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt)
I ran my money up
An' I ain't talkin' no more (Talkin' no more)
Pull up on your block
An' he ain't talkin' no more (Pussy ass)
I hit it from the back
Then climb on top of your ho (21, 21)
I got real money
No Monopoly, ho (Ya dig?)

[Chorus]
Yee ain't talkin' 'bout a bitch-ass thing (ass thang)
Yee ain't shot a bitch-ass thing (Pussy ass nigga)
Yee ain't got a bitch-ass thing (21, 21, 21)
I just bought my bitch a Mustang (Skrt, skrt, skrt)
I just bought myself a Musang (A Musang)
You say you gettin' money, who can't? (Who can't do that shit?)
You say that you got shooters, they can't aim (They can't shoot that shit)
I spent your life savings on a chain (21, 21, 21)

[Verse 2]
21 gang, bitch
You know what I claim, bitch
You know I got stain, bitch
You know that we bang, bitch
Bitch, bitch, lil' biddy bitch
I spent that shit on my wrist
I spent that shit on my clique
Runnin' up racks
Bitch, I got dope on my wrist
Cookin' up dope in the kitchen
Cookin' up dope like it's fish
Bitch, you know it smell like fish
Bitch, you know I got the grits
Who wanna boot up?
(Boot up, boot up, boot up, boot up, boot up)
Shooter, shooter, shooter
I got shooters on deck (yeah)
Pull up on your block an' leave you pussy-niggas whacked
Bitch, I keep extendo, thirty rounds in my TEC
You say that you got shooters, but ain't nobody there

[Chorus]
Yee ain't talkin' 'bout a bitch-ass thing (ass thang)
Yee ain't shot a bitch-ass thing (Pussy ass nigga)
Yee ain't got a bitch-ass thing (21, 21, 21)
I just bought my bitch a Mustang (Skrt, skrt, skrt)
I just bought myself a Musang (A Musang)
You say you gettin' money, who can't? (Who can't do that shit?)
You say that you got shooters, they can't aim (They can't shoot that shit)
I spent your life savings on a chain (21, 21, 21)
