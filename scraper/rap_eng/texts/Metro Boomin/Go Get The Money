[Intro: Young Dolph]
It’s like every day I wake up
I got one thing and one thing only on my mind
Go get the money nigga

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
I just stuffed 3 grams of killer in my swisher
Then dipped that motherfucker in a pint of Act
Your bitch mad at me ‘cause I never call her back
Y’all can keep chasin’ them hoes, I’ma keep chasing that sack
Still at the trap selling onions
The fuck is you doing nigga? Go get some money
Just sent 60 P’s out of town
I’m with two foreign sexy Mexican girls and I got them rolling up out the pound
Yeah I’m all about my Benjamins
What’s poppin’? What’s crackin’? 300 thou’ in all jackets
On the floor in my trap house, bought a Benz just to trap out
Crazy ass niggas follow me from my show
He jumped out at the light with them straps out
My fingers itching, I’m money hungry
100 rounds in my tommy gun
Only thing that we like to do is sell dope and shoot pistols, where I'm from

[Hook: Young Dolph & 2 Chainz]
Ain’t none’ to talk about my nigga, just go get the money
Ain’t none’ to talk about my nigga, just go get the money
Ain’t none’ to talk about my nigga, just go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, ay, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money, go get the money nigga

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Go get the moola
Bust your medula
Trap out the Uber
Shoutout my jeweler
Shoutout my shooter
Sellin’ the Hooters (chicken)
Make it exclusive
Belt came with that Medusa
Pockets on Rasputia
Pinky ring might seduce ya
Me and Big bought our first OZ together
Plug just said I can come and get whatever
When she start choosing I be I can hit her
My nina ross like to sing and my chopper spit acapellas
Just a young man with too many vices
Riding around, serving pounds with suspended license
They saying money talk, you must got bad advice
Just to make a sack I had to make a sacrifice

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Ain’t none’ to talk about my nigga, just go get the money
Ain’t none’ to talk about my nigga, just go get the money
Ain’t none’ to talk about my nigga, just go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, ay, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money
Go get the money, go get the money, go get the money nigga
