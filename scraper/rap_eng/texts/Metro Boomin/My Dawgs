[Intro: Don Cannon & (SL Jones)]
You know the motto: rich niggas ride out (I'll ride for my homies, I'll die for my homies)
[?] niggas fly out, ain't no game (I'll ride for my homies, I'll die for my homies)
You broke niggas continue to walk it out (I'll die for my homies)

[Verse 1: SL Jones]
Rose bottles, gold bottles
Taste like rose gold every time I take a swap
Ciroq [?]
Marshmallow kush, taste like lucky charms
Bowling ball, playing with the flex in it
Bringing jiggy back just like Puff and Ma$e did it
Pok√©mon, yellow Pikachu-chu
If you're a Wolf Street nigga, holla woo woo
If I had one wish I'd wish for more wishes
They ain't gon give it to you cause you gotta go and get it
Poppin champagne to drink the pain away
Pour out some liquor for my dawgs laying in the ground

[Pre-Hook:  Don Cannon & (SL Jones)]
Free the homies at! Free [?]! Kids get doing [?]  (I'll ride for my homies, I'll die for my homies)
Big C, hold your head! Red, I see you homie, what's up? (I'll ride for my homies, I'll die for my homies, I'll die for my homies)

[Hook: SL Jones]
Man I miss all my dawgs, hitting licks with my dawgs
Taking trips with my dawgs, I'm with this shits for my dawgs
Man I miss all my dawgs, empty clips for my dawgs
Flip the script for my dawgs, I'm with this shits for my dawgs
For my dawgs, for my dawgs
For my dawgs, for my dawgs
For my dawgs, for my dawgs
For my dawgs, I'm with this shits for my dawgs
For my dawgs, for my dawgs
For my dawgs, for my dawgs
For my dawgs, for my dawgs
I'm with this shits for my dawgs

[Verse 2: SL Jones]
I've been acting bad and [?]
[?]
If I don't know you ain't no happening
Jonesy watching for those jackers cause I know they wanna take my
Four time grinding, no break time
Keep it 40 [?] I ain't on my waistline
I don't want no problems I just wanna stay alive
This ride or die shit ain't no hobby it's a way of life

[Pre-Hook:  Don Cannon & (SL Jones)]
Kids get all my made niggas (I'll ride for my homies, I'll die for my homies)
Shout to Freddy G! Errol Westbrook, what's up? We do this for you, hold your head! (I'll ride for my homies, I'll die for my homies, I'll die for my homies)

[Hook]

[Pre-Hook:  Don Cannon & (SL Jones)]
Salute to all my fallen soldiers (I'll ride for my homies, I'll die for my homies)
All my homies in the federal penitentiary, everybody in the county jail, we do this for y'all! (I'll ride for my homies, I'll die for my homies, I'll die for my homies)

[Hook: SL Jones]
Man I miss all my dawgs, hitting licks with my dawgs
Taking trips with my dawgs, I'm with this shits for my dawgs
Man I miss all my dawgs, empty clips for my dawgs
Flip the script for my dawgs, I'm with this shits for my dawgs
