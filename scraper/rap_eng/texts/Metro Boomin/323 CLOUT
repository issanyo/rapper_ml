(chorus)
I just need a mili
I just need a mili (mili)
Im just in a benz
Shawty got no friends

Erybody know klay skii the best

(verse)
I just need a mili
Shawty actin silly
Sayin that she want me
Skii dont think its funny
I just need a honey
Who dont need the money (neeed the money)
Hop on da clout like a fuckin bunnie
All my niggas vultures for  my fuckin culture
I just need a shordy who gon hold it down
Bringin all the clout to the fuckin town
Yeah i got the crown to my city now
Yeah i need a hunnid on my bill now

I just need a mili
I just need a mili (mili)
Im just in a benz
Shawty got no friends
Dont reach my ends
Hit you with a lens
Then i get the checks
Everybody know im next
