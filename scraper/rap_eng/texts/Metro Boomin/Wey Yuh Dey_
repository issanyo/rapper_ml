[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Wey yuh dey?
Look...

[Verse]
You play a beat, it's simple
Like u add water to Jell-O, dawg
Hard spitter, chill fellow, dawg
Yeah, you know I keep it mellow dawg
Met a girl who was Japanese
She showed her kitty, said, "Hello dog"
But I had to say hell no dawg
No strings attached like cello's dawg

But she trying to say how she thinks we should take it further
How when as we meet you want to show me your furry burger?
We didn't even talk much, most shit you kinda murmured
U into nets cause you's a trap, and I can't be your server

Triple entendre
Nigga a monster
Lives in my mind
But I'm not a host
Just a vivid cool Rasta
Takes from my heart and in return
It acts as lyrical sponsor
Told my ex I'm my own ray of life, u need a man to...

Make you feel happy
She said she would slap me
Next time she sees me, her hands all over my face
Like a teen with acne
L-O-L if u think I'm taking that, girl you crack, oui
That's why you date a bitter man dawg, that's word to Rakhee

Clean forget who Paxx be
Man on the way to where cash be
Doing shows at Kaiso Blues, mixing soca and jazz. We...
Doing just what's lacking
We the damn kings
And damn queens, that's word to DeZii
Rest In Peace, that's word to Neszy
Equal rights: that's word to lezzies, gay men and trans, dawg
That doe apply to rap, with some of y'all I just can't dawg
Tell me when you ever see a god try run par with an ant dawg?
Say I don't support but when we throw shows, where ya at dawg?

Where were you?
To support your fellow peers
Where were you?
When nobody used to care
Where were you?
Probably hatin from your chair
Where are you?
Right now you're probably still there
Uh

Never come to my shows, never see your ass in an open mic
Yet you want me do songs with you, and act like everything kosher right?
Ya don't work to get better but I'm supposed to be open? Like...
Frig that, I'z get bread cause I not on that loafer life
I smoke from pipes and papers also
I'z the bomb, like the day ISIS make the mall close
OD, Saint and  CYNX like Aldo, they's give me hope
Gonna do an all Trini show
Make banks like that Billy bloke
"In" is what i really go
I want cheese, put a lot at stake, no Philly though
I feel like what Missy wrote:
My skill I work it, can't stand the rain - it's shitty yo
Dropped Taxes on their bitch ass
With Rome dey on the video
Bout millions
You really broke

Where yo ass was at when I was puffin on the dank?
Where yo ass was at when it come to making bank?
Where yo ass was at when I was being a beast like Hank?
Where yo ass was at when I was getting head from mancs?
That's a reds...


[Outro]
Hahaha
Yeah
Eh?
Wey yuh dey?
Wey yuh dey?
And I don't play
Bands bands
