[Verse]
My grandma was sleepin'
I was in the kitchen tryna whip up the *beep*
I ain't with the nose candy
But my bitch jeepin', sniffin' the seat
Stackin' that to the O to the K, straight poppin' E
I am a user and I am a seller, bitch I am a beast
Just prepared for the whole town, my block gonna eat
You pull up, car pimpin now?
Buy my straight cash, bitch, you got a lease
Every blue hundred I've been on since I made Uzi
Was actually four hundred (four hundred)
My pockets is big, just like a Hummer H3
I mean an H1, fuck is you broke, your cake down?
Hundred thousand, what you say, son
My money older than Raekwon
Might light up the block like Akon
My bitch old she grew up on SEGA
If I'm in New York, I'm trappin', I'm trappin', I'm trappin' Straight out the bodega
Talkin' shit I might just fade ya, I am blacker than a raider
Woman, I work on it later, she got the work in her anus
No comprende, she speakin' Spanish
She love a nigga cause I'm famous

[Hook]
My trap game so serious, my trap game so serious
My trap game so serious, my trap game so serious
My trap game so serious, my trap game so serious
My trap game so serious, my trap game so serious
Motorola, it be goin' *beep*
Motorola, it be goin' *beep* *beep*
Motorola, it be goin' *beep*
Motorola, it be goin' *beep* *beep* (work, work!)
Motorola, it be goin' *beep*
Motorola, it be goin' *beep* *beep*
