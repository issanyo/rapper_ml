Shut the fuck up hoe I dont really need you

This ain't fan love dont wanna meet you
Drop 3k on myself no I won’t treat you
Shut the fuck up hoe I dont really need you
I got gucci goggles on but I dont see you
This ain't fan love dont wanna meet you
Drop 3k on myself no I won’t treat you

Verse: Famous Dex
I don’t do the xans

This stupid bitch all on me all on my dick
She try something still upping my stick
Her sister all on me I ain't take no pics yea

Verse: Yungpow

Ima keep counting these racks all day

Ima keep making this money bitch trick or treat
You know I got the heat on everyday
Wake up make money get paid
Lead the wave like what simon say
Lead the wave like what Simon say
