I understand, I understand, I understand
I understand, I understand, I understand
I understand, I understand, I understand
That hunnid racks, that cuban links, the kilograms
I understand, I understand, I understand
I understand, I understand, I understand
I understand, I understand, I understand
I understand, I understand, I understand
That hunnid racks, that cuban links, the kilograms

[Verse]
I understand that lil uzi might crack a deal
I understand how that shit right here 'bout to feel
They askin' me on the streets am I gettin' meals
I said I don't care, as long as I survive for my next meal
And I be gettin' all this paper, I'm doin' well
I understand that next year, I'll be XXL
I understand that I be juggin' on the block (I'm juugin' my nigga)
But lil uzi gotta watch out for the 12
And I don't fuck with no fuck niggas, they be snitchin'
I give you Glock if you got problems, don't start bitchin'
I hit you up like in your shit, nigga not with it
And this Glock tend to knock you off your pelvis
Young nigga but I'm heavy like a OG
Ya your bitch wan' suck my dick, but she ain't even know me
Talkin' shit I put a hole in you like slowly
Hit you with 8 or 24 if you think you Kobe

[Hook]
I understand, I understand, I understand
I understand, I understand, I understand
I understand, I understand, I understand
That hunnid racks, that cuban links, the kilograms
