[Intro]
If young metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

[Kevin Hart]
Oh it done came to this
All good things come to an end
You hear me ladies
This good thing has officially come to an end
Now imma tell you the one thing that you got
You got a variation of a bunch of sounds that we can't really
We can't really break down
I'm just as confused as you are about some of them but the bottom line is we made good music today
Skeet skeet
Brr brr
Chchdee chchdee
Thats just a couple that I got
From listening to some of the stuff
I will tell you this man
This return is official
And when I say I'm back, you better believe it you hear me
A.K.A. Mr. Music A.K.A. Mr. God damn rap attack
A.K.A. conquer all unless I wanna be conquered tall
This has been an amazing experience guys
