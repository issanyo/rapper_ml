[Verse 1]
Aye, look
I'm infested with
Somethin' like expertness
Like some kind of specialist
And they guessed that I was joking about being the best in this
And this ain’t even the dream, this is just the journey to it
I’m gone rise above the greats and then thank you all when I do it
Man I feel like Cardi, because I make them money moves
And they wanna laugh at me, but I think they funny too
Man I stay countin money, boy it ain't nothin new
I got stake on my plate, when they rock with lunchables
And I only trust a few, them my brothers, them my crew
We gone come up, and no we ain’t ever heard about you
Can’t compete with the big dawg’s stay in your lane
You ain’t worthy of our time man that’s all I’m sayin
Lil week link boy, we stay in it strong tho
And you fade out in a few months like Pokémon go
And we still high up, gone be up there long tho
Ain’t nobody gonna know your name, call you John Doe yuh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hate because they know they wish they could be me
Straight jealousy what they think when they see me
They rock with my boys, nah they must be dreaming
You never gone be where I’m going believe me
I kill a metro beat, I commit that crime
Cops must love me, because I don’t gotta serve time
Instead I’m in that car serving monster rhymes
Run up on me, get dropped, quicker than you can drop a dime
Or you get straight layed out on a track
When I hop on the mic and spit them facts
Got you going crazy, don’t know how to act
Don’t you put me in that mode of attack
Aye here’s a fun fact
I swear you don’t want that
(Are you gone take my girl?)
Man I’ve already done that
She on my side now boy don’t think she gone run back
She on my side now boy you what she don’t want back yuh

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
At the jeweler busting AP's
Nah not lately
Been pulling ladies
Their boyfriends hate me
But they can’t fade me
So nobody gotta save me
They know anything that I do, I do greatly
I go straight boss
Diamonds, Jack Frost
I hand out L’s, take this loss
If I want it, I get it, don’t matter the cost
I’m the streets, cuz you just might get wrecked if you cross
I’m a bar spittin maniac dropping crazy tracks, it’s amazing that my haters ‘bout to see me making racks
I got rhymes so bomb you would think I’m a terrorist
Skinny boy, but I’ll still have you embarrassed
Last thing you want is to try and mess with me
I’m the G.O.A.T. not now but wait and see
Cuz one day I’ll be, I stay on my ascension
But if you don’t like me, why you pay attention?
(Ask yourself that)
