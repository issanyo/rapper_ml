[Verse 1] (Breydawg)
Big bills in my bank account so better come correct
I'll pull out another hundred, really what did you expect?
And them air pods, ain't got them yet, but they will be coming back soon
And whoever jacked me, better hope I never find you
Flex hard on these haters they ain't nothing
Stay talking behind the screen, scared to be confronting
Scared to jack me straight up, cause they know that they'll get chased down
Don't got enough inside there pants to look at my face now
Sneaky little coward, but I still be chillin
Still finding the beats that I still be killin
Still be in the studio, wrecking the mic
Still be with your girl, cuz now I'm what she likes
Yo

[Hook 2x] (Breydawg)
I got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Billions of them blessings and that's why y'all keep giving hate
Finna be the greatest duo coming out the biggest state
So watch how you speaking when you talking 'bout the real greats

[Verse 2] (BryanAA)
Rhymes be coming straight from the mind
This is our time
I'ma use it while I can
Me and Brey gone come up in the game
All these haters ran
But we still didn't give a damn
Tx where we livin
Mad respect, our religion
Compound don't play around
We be schooling all these clowns
If you mess with B, you mess with me, and I'll knock you out
Ice all on our neck, and you know it like to bling
Y'all haters trynna see us sink
But it's not gonna happen
We found our talent yeah that's rappin
I be swangin in every lane
But we still be getting paid
All you haters lame
Me, B, and J be doing the same old thing
Just a different day, but we still be killin it
That's just how we play

[Hook 2x] (Breydawg)
I got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Billions of them blessings and that's why y'all keep giving hate
Finna be the greatest duo coming out the biggest state
So watch how you speaking when you talking 'bout the real greats
