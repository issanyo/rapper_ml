Yeah yeah yeah, HA

(Hook)
Mask off, fuck it mask on
Mask on, fuck it mask off
Mask off, fuck it mask on
Mask on, fuck it mask off

(Verse 1)
I don't fuck with them masks
Tear'em off in halves
Absurdist rap, like I look at life and laugh
Wearing mixed shoes, getting mixed reviews
Embracing it, cause I ain't one to pick and choose
Mask off, fuck it get the flows on
I'm on hold, I been feeling like I'm so gone
Mask on, when I be on some kissin ass shit
Mask off, when I be on some kickin ass shit
Sugarcoating it; no one's gonna give me shit
The reasons I do this is for the fuck of it
The music is free, and I ain't makin loads off it
So blow my load if you see me getting rich off it
On second thought, blow my load anyway
Mask on? mask off I'ma cum on your face
It's all over you, lookin up I'm over you
Think it's over? Let me give an overview
I'm over you
All I offer is the truth
It's got me loose, for me to win you've got to lose
Mask off, mask on
Now let me get an action
Hide behind it think it's safe to call it all an act then
Look me in the eye and tell me I ain't into rappin
Blind me from the way and ask me then to call you captain
My last years I was hiding even tho you see me
My last tears I was listening to Tracy Chapman
Mask on mask off mask on mask off mask off mask off mask off

(Verse 2)
So what's the point?
I'm hard enough for you to fuck?
Don't trip bitch I'm high enough for you to jump
I'm slacking off, might think of jumping just to save you
But then we'd both be dead, I try I won't amaze you
I'll save my debut
The name remains like "at last man"
Look around you all you see is my hashtag
Mask on, mask off
Think of saving your face, cut the act, lose the mask, leave it all without a trace
Switch the flows
I'm tired of war
Mask on mask off mask on mask off

(Verse 3)
HA
I ain't finished
Fill up my bars like I replenish
A Cairo cynic
For the record, I am Guinness
I think of all the ways I can escape the game of life but I been slayin shit ever since murder was the case
I'm off the leash, a decent human being at least
I got my piece of peace of mind cause I ain't never been at ease
I got my God, I got my faith ain't messing with religion
God sent me a message said that I'm forgiven
I got my girl on top of the world and we holding hands
Getting ready for the future thank you in advance
I got my bars, I got my punches and my punching bag
I got the swag in abundance and I'm talking back
Talking black like my clothes like I'm Kobe Bryant
Talkin white like my soul like I'm Conan O'brien
I thought I'm flippin all the pages but I write small
Embracing life for what it is, now my mask's off
