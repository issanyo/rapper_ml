[Hook: Project Pat]
Hard work pays off
Get one if you sellin' salt
Started with a half and worked my way up to a 9 piece

Hard work pays off
Get one if you sellin' salt
Started with a half and worked my way up to a 9 piece

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
I got bombs out to the bando
K's in the bushes, strapped like Rambo
Light your ass up like a candle
Any robber we gonna handle
Selling drugs in my sandles
Grab a gram, dream of a lambo
Niggas wanna stiff me on some major work, now body's stick like a Mentos
Project Peisenburg, I'm out here getting money dog, Breaking Bad
I'm just tryna break a bitches back and break the niggas back
Flipping crack
20's and them 50's yeah I'm snatching that
Get one .30 [?] extendo, you be catchin' that
Sippin' Tussin, triggers bussin'
Money always my discussion
You in the house, bitch cuddling
I'm in the street straight hustlin'
Them baking soda make it come and [?]
But hustlers [?] in a day then a week
Long as the clientelle is there, the plug is feeding you
You got the flower to make the bread, the hood is needing you

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
Icy like a Eskimo
Louis pouch filled with dough
A Russian rifle with a clip twisted like a bow
Plenty foe, hustlin' bows
Stacking up, plenty dough
Like Papa Jon, need extra cheese on my pizza bro
So many niggas comin' through like a Walmart
Neighborhood used to be good now its all hot
Junkies looking for that white, looking for that brown
I got a connect on the brown south side of town
You stacked the money and you catchin' bitches like a cone
My dick a trick your gal, jaws I release the load
I ain't no pretty boy but I make them hundreds fold
And keep it California smoke, tryna blow
