(Intro)
I don't wanna remember last year shit
I don't wanna remember (xeno)
Fuck where you been......
Shilling

(Hook)
Where the fuck you been, when I needed you the most?
Where the fuck you been, when I got trapped?
Where the fuck you been, when bitches wouldn't feed me?
Where the fuck you been, only friend was the silence?

(Verse 1)
Where the fuck you been, when the fire was burning?
Where the fuck you been, had no where to run?
Where the fuck you been, you came and ignored?
Where the fuck you been, had no where to go?
Where the fuck you been, when I needed you the most?
Where the fuck you been, when I got trapped?
Where the fuck you been, when bitches wouldn't feed me?
Where the fuck you been, only friend was the silence?
Where the fuck you been, when niggas ask me join pirates?
Man, that shit was making millions though it wasn't legal
Where the fuck you been, when the dog had a better life?
Now you heard me on the radio, tryna come show me love
My mamma didn't raise no fool, I know all the things I been through
Had to walk 90km with no whip
Where the fuck you been, when I was stuck in the grocery?
Had to pull the gun with no skill, learn t from Sylvester Stallone, Rambo series

(Hook 2)
I done all I could just to survive
Fourty four hundred was the figure on my shoulder
Only God saved me April 12
There was a reason I got survived

(Verse 2)
Where the fuck you been, when I had to pretend?
Where the fuck you been, when I had no space to write?
Where the fuck you been, when niggas try take chance?
Where the fuck you been, when Uzi was my pillow?
Had to work all day long, guard the night by myself
Where the fuck you been, when I was a bachelor?
Bitch I have been thirsty so long for that pussy
I'mma do round after round, like a nigga doing press up
Man, I had bitches who were on the mood
I had bitches who were honest and sexy
Where the fuck you been, bitches kept asking where, when to fuck?
Where the fuck you been, when I had no drink?
Red bull was the only drink on my disposal
Fuck where you been, I'm Shilling, Young Shilling (super)
Fourty four hundred was the figure on my shoulder

(Hook)
Where the fuck you been, when I needed you the most?
Where the fuck you been, when I got trapped?
Where the fuck you been, when bitches wouldn't feed me?
Where the fuck you been, only friend was the silence?

(Verse 3)
There was a reason I got survived
There was a reason I got survived
There are reasons for drinking
There are reasons for drugs
There are reasons for vacay
I believe keeping it one hundred
I really never gave up life
H.O.P.E was my only nightmare

(Hook)
Where the fuck you been, when I needed you the most?
Where the fuck you been, when I got trapped?
Where the fuck you been, when bitches wouldn't feed me?
Where the fuck you been, only friend was the silence?

I done all I could to survive
Had to pull the gun with no skill
Learn t from Sylvester Stallone, rambo series
Fourty four hundred was the figure on my shoulder
