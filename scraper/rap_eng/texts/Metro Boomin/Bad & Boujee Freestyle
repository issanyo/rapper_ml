[Hook: Renz Young]
Rain drop
Drop top
Fuck all you niggas you not hot
You can not tell me you not opp
Putting in work I can not stop
I came from nothing to something
Your main bitch I'm cutting
Then pass to my cousin
Don't press none my buttons
Or hear that percussion
You can speak to the tone that's the end of discussion for real

[Hook: D. Bridge]
You niggas mad we moving
Cooking up dope wit this music
These niggas is trash, useless
We not worried about how they moving
My bitch is Bad and boujee
Look like she straight outta movie
Real hair, real titties, real booty
If she ain't giving neck she gone lose me

[Verse: Renz Young]
Yea, I been dropping records back to back to back
Been ballin balling check the stats I'm back on that
I keep the roof flipping guess that's a achrobat
My nigga I can't play around wit em
Out in Minnesota left the town with it
Trynna run the city hope the crown fittin'
Bitches know I'm balling leave the mound with em
Took a month off now I'm back at it
Tried to sleep on me now I'm back spazzing
Heard you fell off how did that happen
Cuz you bad rapping don't be mad at it
All that beef shit we just laugh at it
When the pound on us we ain't hash tagging
Momma told better get the bag rapping
Cuz it's too late when the past happen, for real
Don't call me conscious
Boy just call me monstrous
Shawty head game like she got a doctorate
All these new 20's they just got adopted
I been doin' numbers now they got a problem
I been low key like I got asylum
Stop that online nigga pocket watching
I stayed patient then got it popping
Now all of my bitches is bad a bouje
I don't got time for a goofy
Stop telling em what you got planned
Cuz that shit don't matter till you do it
My bitches is bad and bouje
Better act right for I lose it
Gotta watch out for the shooters
But I always watch out for the judas

[Verse: D. Bridge]
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
I just come back from Atlanta
Wait, I was just out in LA
Wow, Bridge be all over the planet
Damn, Word on the street is I'm paid
Uh, Word on the street is I'm made
What? Need some repellent, you buggin
Nigga we came from nothing
But then we just made it to something
Shawty in here looking supa bad
I told her my name Mcloving
Niggas in here looking supa mad
From the way that my name be buzzin'
The streets say I'm cooking like the old D
Shawty keep on looking like she know me
Unit full of g's like it's 03
Sipping OE
Middle finger to the police
Hoe please, hold these nuts
While I roll trees up, hold up
Don't tease us or
When I throw funds for fun
Ones after ones
You won't get none
Oh Jesus
Gotta plug with no outlet
Jug thru the city all the way to the outlets
Just for a outfit
Pleasant prairie
Living legendary
I hope heaven hear me
When this song drop
That's a long shot
Since we underground
Starting think we was born in the wrong spot
In the MIL Ima staple
I'm ALIVE and I'm well so I'm grateful
On my way to New York for a day yo
Son scorching hot
Unorthodox, like drake wit a Draco
Chasing these pesos

[Outro: D. Bridge]
Man, I'm out this bitch
