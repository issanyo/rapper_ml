[Intro]
I’m trapped in my psyche
Right me
I've got to run now but I’m tripping nightly
Might be
Getting unsightly
I’ve noticed that shit doesn’t frighten me
I can be right inbetween a viper and Mike Tyson fight in the ring
Bite me
Unlikely I might feel a thing
Why am I still lighting this thing?

[Chorus]
I won't lie no more
This shit isn’t getting me high no more

[Bridge]
But this guy I’ve been calling
His supply has been falling
Since he met me I’ve been appalling
I buy like I’m balling
Light five while I’m rolling
A sixth and I’m rolling on nine in the morning like

[Verse 1]
I don’t wanna lie no more
But this shit isn’t getting me high
But I’m a definitely try
Until I get it, it’s my destiny, no question please don’t press the rewind
I’m on that ecstasy
Wine, I hid the rest of the weed
For me and then convinced my friends they left it behind
I got specialer needs
I’ve been up consecutively
Since I got these remedies so these bars aren't technically
But heck they be mine
I'm looking at how they beckon to me I
Just can’t resist 'em
I planned to nix em from my system
Damn it, now I manage with them
Only got a gram, four pills and a tab
More still in the bag
Homie I bet you I could stand to mix 'em
A Xan, I nicked one
Take a shot, take another, Wu-Tang the spliff and bake a rock
Fuck it
I'm buying it whether it’s fake or not

[Chorus]
How did I fly so low?
This shit isn’t getting me high no more
I should try let go
But I forgot what it’s like and so

[Bridge]
This guy I’ve been calling
His supply keep on falling
Since he met me I’ve been appalling
I buy like I’m balling
I might be a problem
I shouldn’t be cheefing so often
But I’ll die from withdrawal if I leave
Although I’m crawling I’m free
See my mind keeps on wanting
To try seek the calling
I’m all in
That’s why this guy I’ve been calling's
Supply keep on falling
Since he met me I’ve been appalling
I buy like I’m balling
I might be a problem
But I’ll die from withdrawal if I leave
But my mind keeps on wanting
To try seek the calling
I’m swallowing all of the E
But I feel like the sky keep on falling on me!

[Bridge 2]
I feel like the sky keep on falling on me
Oh yeah
Oh the sky keep on falling on me
Falling on me
Me, me
Sky falling, falling

[Verse 2]
I’m walking on air, swimming in smoke
Women and coke
They diminishing like Eminem flows
Imminent stroke? My dick
I’m outliving the most
Listen I know I’m sick
And I’m shivering
Hope for the dope deliverance my liver is broke
I’m considering finishing some more liquor to cope with it
Nope this isn't a joke
I’m still coaxed to trip even though I’m already on the floor
"Supposed to quit"
But I say the same thing over again
No wonder all my records are broken
“I say no wonder all my records are broken”
Tell 'em how I’m setting in motion
My plan to try regretting the potent
Digressing and correcting my irreparable focus
Before I turn into a vegetable on drips
Next second I’m toking
Taking a tab overdosing
I get stressing and grow itches when my regiment's altered
So I never falter
The high is the prize I cry I know that
I can still land it even though I’m standing on the sky
Demanding why?
Oh and is “that guy I’ve been calling” ever gonna fucking reply?
It’s been like 3 hours amına koyayim what?
Is he sleeping?
It’s like half past two
Why can’t he get his ugly fat ass moving?
I need a re-up if he fucking doesn’t hit me with a fat ass doobie
There’ll be a sea of trouble coming for him man that’s truly a bitch
Truth of it is
I’m just stupid as shit
And I wouldn’t feel it but I could do with a hit
“Fuck what else is there to say"
I guess that I'm going through with this shit 'cause I won't

[Chorus]
Hide no more
I got some good shit inside my drawer
And I’ll buy for sure
But this shit ain’t getting me high no more

[Outro]
Yeah yeah
But I feel like the sky keep on falling on me
Yeah yeah
And I feel like the sky keep on falling on me
But I feel like the sky keep on falling me
Falling on me, me
'Cause I feel like the sky keep on falling on me
Help me
