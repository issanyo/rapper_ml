[Intro]
Freebandz Sunny in this motherfucker
Original Black Migo gang
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro

[Pre-Hook]
Don't make me go and get the Wraith
I'm tryna dodge another case
Order Ace of Spades by the case
Tell 'em shoot the nigga in his face
I keep a pack of wolves by the safe
I rob the bank, I'm goin' on a chase
I hear the styrofoam, they goin' crazy
I got my chains on, they like lasers
And you gon' make me go and get the carbine
And I was tacky back when I was starvin'
And I ain't lookin' back with these fortunes
I'm pickin' up hella endorsements
My chain is yellow on yellow
My bitch, she's yellow on yellow
In the kitchen remixin' this yola
They ran out of red, I'm drinkin' on yellow

[Hook]
Tell me you came with the 'fetti
Tell me you came with some 'fetti
Tell me you came with some 'fetti
Tell me you came with the 'fetti
Tell me you came with the 'fetti
Tell me you came with some 'fetti
Tell me you came with the 'fetti
Tell me you came with some 'fetti

[Verse 1]
'Fetti, 'fetti, 'fetti, 'fetti
Reincarnated Makaveli
Audemars Piguet a presi (presi)
Presidential with a bezzy (bezzy)
And I'm sharper than a machete
I done made it, now I'm greedy
Takin' the codeine, it's red
I shake it up in a Tahiti
200 somethin' sittin' on the dash
The Bentley Spur makin' 'em crash
Sippin' codeine, rollin' grass
I don't agree what you're doin'
I don't agree who you're screwin'
I fucked around, opened a traphouse in Europe
I fucked around, throwed away all of my problems
They ran out of singles, I'm throwin' up hundreds

[Pre-Hook]
Don't make me go and get the Wraith
I'm tryna dodge another case
Order Ace of Spades by the case
Tell 'em shoot the nigga in his face
I keep a pack of wolves by the safe
I rob the bank, I'm goin' on a chase
I hear the styrofoam, they goin' crazy
I got my chains on, they like lasers
And you gon' make me go and get the carbine
And I was tacky back when I was starvin'
And I ain't lookin' back with these fortunes
I'm pickin' up hella endorsements
My chain is yellow on yellow
My bitch, she's yellow on yellow
In the kitchen remixin' this yola
They ran out of red, I'm drinkin' on yellow

[Hook]
Tell me you came with the 'fetti
Tell me you came with some 'fetti
Tell me you came with some 'fetti
Tell me you came with the 'fetti
Tell me you came with the 'fetti
Tell me you came with some 'fetti
Tell me you came with the 'fetti
Tell me you came with some 'fetti

[Verse 2]
Tell me you came with the wax
Man, I'm about flippin' some stacks
Man, I'm about flippin' some racks
I had to flip me some racks
You can treasure and honor this
I'm the one breakin' my promises
I started losin' my conscience
We creepin' like Jeepers Creepers
That codeine is sleepy, sleepy
That codeine, it got us so sleepy
I'm plannin' on savin' my soul
Ain't fuckin' 'round savin' no hoes
I burn up a zip, that's a' O
You can smell all this weed on my clothes

[Pre-Hook]
Don't make me go and get the Wraith
