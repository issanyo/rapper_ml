[Chorus - Word Play]
That bitch, thot thot, sucking this dick like a blow pop
Her body look good in a crop top, all in her walls like knock-knock
Everything on her designer, I ain't seen no bitch that's finer
Ass coming out of the bottom, her idol is prolly Rihanna
That bitch is bad and boujee, all of her friends is some groupies
Her thick ass in a two-piece, me and my niggas get two each
That bitch is bad and boujee, all of her friends is some groupies
Her thick ass in a two-piece, me and my niggas get two each

[Verse 1 - Tazz]
Cooking up dope on the stove top, whip it, let it rock up
Y'all niggas not like us, we hustle, we savage
Bad bitch never average, hopping on the dick like bokers to
Switching hoes like flows, hit the booth, they like, "there he goes!"
Killing beats should charge me for murder
Look how I hurt 'em, all black like Bruce Wayne
Staying in my own lane, list come through with chump change
But I stay collect, smoking tree not gonna stress, haaa!
My dog said come through with a zip
Said, "bet", what I'm 'spose to do, be broke like you? Hell naw
Imma shine like Gates' grill, fuck how a hater feel
I'm gon head and chase a mill, put my niggas on for real
Smoking on that GG nigga got me high as hell
Chasing paper nigga fuck a nigga county jail
What you gon do when I run up on you fool?
Nothing, my team winning nigga fuck you!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Word Play]
Yeah yeah yeah! Nah, Word Play gon spaz on this shit
All the blue hundreds but I ain't no crip
I work at Five Guy's you know burgers and shit
I graduate soon I'm be happy as shit
Money gon flow like waterfalls bitch
Yo friends are ugly like Lilo & Stitch
Throwing that ass and I like how she pitch
I roll up, I roll up, I roll up, I roll up, I'm like a Fruit Roll-Up
Always stay high, and I'm up in her pie, and her boyfriend he gotta just hold up
Go to Health Services, faking a cough, so Word Play can gon and just pour up
She bad and she boujee, she light like the sun, I'll have her come back like a coda
That pressure it got me snoring, this a Honda yeah it's foreign
I'm creezed up y'all look boring, and this one chick she look foreign
And she high jump for Georgia (State), bruh she bad as a motha
Ass poking out like a Tonka, gimme a chance I'll go bonkers
My face is up in her knockers, my kids all over her counter
Her lipstick all over my collar, gimme 2 days imma I'll call her
This creez and this dick is what got her, la har√© cansada
Boy I'm so hot I could solder, OU my alma of mater's (OU!)

[Chorus]
