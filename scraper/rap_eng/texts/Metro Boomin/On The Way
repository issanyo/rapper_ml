[Intro]
We on the way! Just know (x3)
When the streets get dry, we on the way
It's on the way, it's on the way, it's on the way
They trying to stay, they trying to stay, they trying to stay
Don't be late (Taylor Gang what's up?)
(Metro boomin want some more nigga) D Kelly!
Cannon, Cannon, Cannon

[Hook]
I smoke by the pound and I roll to the face (Hey!)
I go out of town and take it on a plane (Shit! Oh!)
They know that I got it, it's all that I said
That pack on the way, that pack on the way (Go, go!)
Man, that pack on the way, that pack on the way (Killem, killem, oh!)
That pack on the way, man that pack on the way (Damn!)
They know that I got it, it's all that I said (Go, go!)
That pack on the way, that pack on the way

[Verse 1]
Said you been smoking a blunt, that was back in the day (Way back!)
I had it, I got it, I roll it then smoke to the face (Yoo!)
I make sure I smoke in the bed cause I smoke every day (Yeah nigga, every day! Ayee!)
I hopped in my ride and I head to another new place (Another one!)
I get on the plane then I'm rocking an animal (Alright get this shit nigga)
Seen the price of my jeans and it ain't understandable (Whoa! Shit)
I rap what you thinking and I'm smoking, I'm drinking
Niggas is sinking, all you little niggas need beatings
So I told 'em, a joint i'ma roll it
Her ass i'ma hold it, and mind i'ma mould it (Mould!)
I came and got chosen, Her man didn't notice
And I be like hold up, don't go no where (Noo!)
Trying to get a photo (Noo!), thats a no-no
