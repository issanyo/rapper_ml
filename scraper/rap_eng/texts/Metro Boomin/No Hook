[Verse 1: Melo]
She ran her mouth so she is deleted
Don’t fuck with these niggas they salty like seasoning
Ran to the bag cuz I got my reasons
My life a 1 seater so u is not seated
Don't fuck with these niggas so no I’m not greatin
The world is so stupid so what is the meanin
I know that I’m woke but I’m constantly dreamin
Them bullets like lava them bitches stay heated
Aye.   Ima real ass nigga foreal
Keep on grinding till they offer a deal
I’m money chasin till I touch ima mill
Aye.  In these streets, any nigga get killed
Standing tall like my nigga Shaquille
I’m standing tall like that nigga O’Neil
Please don’t play me ..cuz I am not stupid
Kick off yo top so..now it is roofless
My nigga shoot arrows he kinda like Cupid
No reloading guns them bitches keep shootin
From the chi were them niggas be zooted
Them hunnids fake who the fuck are u foolin

[Verse 2; Nolimit Draco]
Play with me and it’s off with your cap
Don't tell no lies cuz it’s Ik that’s it cap
Navigation bitch I’m way off the map
Money be calling I pick up and listen
Run up the money my only ambition
Montana calling I decline the phone (hello)
Don't wanna talk to so leave alone
Got me crazy and is how with yo dome
I keep it one hunnid you know I don’t lie
When my uncle died all I did was cry
Told my bae don’t tell them lies
Nbg till the day I die
Got figure out why these niggas hating
Pray to god cuz I need some blessings
Fuck it all I'm tired of stressing
You want me gone but you steady complaining
Like Melo said tryna chase up a mill
Fuck that bitch I know she ain’t real
We ain’t shaking hands I don’t want a deal
Uh Draco
