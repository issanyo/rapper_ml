[Verse 1: Jose Guapo]
You ever dreamed about something, then woke up and went and got it?
From a old-school Chevy to a foreign big body
Nigga, look at my closet
That's a whole lot of thousands
We don't look at no prices
Niggas never be counting
I don't need no accountant, I count this shit by myself
I'ma keep on drinking lean, but I know it's bad for my health
I Moschino my belt
I'ma up on my wealth
And if she let in that pussy, I'ma go Michael Phelps
We just some young wild niggas from the projects
And you can Google me, bitch, I'm worth a big check

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
Money, cars, clothes, hoes
Money, cars, clothes, jewelry
Money, cars, clothes, hoes
Money, cars, clothes, jewelry
(I want it all, I want it all)
I want all the jewelry (I want it all, all, all)
I want all the hoes (I want it all, I want it all)
I want all the clothes (I want it all, all, all)
I want all the cars (I want it all, I want it all)
I want all the money (I want it all, all, all)
I want everything, I want everything

[Verse 2: Blac Youngsta]
Gang, gang, gang
Half a million in my [?]
Gang, bang, bang, bang
Get out of line and I'm pulling shit, man
Me and my niggas rep the same gang
Haters, they'll lay up under you
Used to be broke, I got my money up
If you niggas fall, help your homie up
I got my MAC-11, I got my Tommy tucked
(Fuck nigga, little nigga, little nigga)
No, these niggas, they don't want no war with us
(Little bitch, little bitch)
They don't want no war with us (fuck nigga)
Yeah, I'm 'bout to feel on her tits
I'm 'bout to give her some dick
I'ma just put her away
I'ma just put that little bitch in my grandmomma's crib
Got racks in my attic, yeah
They know I'm a savage, yeah
Did so many bad things, I might not go to Heaven, yeah

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
Money, cars, clothes, hoes
Money, cars, clothes, jewelry
Money, cars, clothes, hoes
Money, cars, clothes, jewelry
(I want it all, I want it all)
I want all the jewelry (I want it all, all, all)
I want all the hoes (I want it all, I want it all)
I want all the clothes (I want it all, all, all)
I want all the cars (I want it all, I want it all)
I want all the money (I want it all, all, all)
I want everything, I want everything

[Verse 3: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Two bitches, five bitches, ten bitches, need all the bitches
Five-car garage
Five cars with a V12 engine, all different
I'm in DC, rocking old-school Scottie Pippen's
Young nigga came from the trenches
Look at me now, momma, I done did it
Got a personal stylist, everything fitted
We ran up the digits, we ran up the money
Hood, but I dress like I come from another country
Saint Laurent cheetah, it's a jungle
Money, cars, clothes, I want it
Catch a cold, I might catch pneumonia
I want your bitch, she can't pick up 'til the morning
I want it all, I want it all, they [?]
MONY POWR RSPT, I'm Tony
Nigga playing about my money
Have the young niggas pull up on you

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
Money, cars, clothes, hoes
Money, cars, clothes, jewelry
Money, cars, clothes, hoes
Money, cars, clothes, jewelry
(I want it all, I want it all)
I want all the jewelry (I want it all, all, all)
I want all the hoes (I want it all, I want it all)
I want all the clothes (I want it all, all, all)
I want all the cars (I want it all, I want it all)
I want all the money (I want it all, all, all)
I want everything, I want everything
