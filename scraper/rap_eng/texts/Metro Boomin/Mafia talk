[Hook]
Say she want pills Imma feed it to her
Pass it to ya friends let's keep it going
She say I'm that nigga, I'm already knowin'
Pistol on my waist, he ain't see it showin'
Savage Squad nigga, but I stay Glo'n (Pint of red I stay pourin')
Had to borrow that bitch cause she ain't yours
It's a thousand on your head, I paid for it

[Verse 1]
Real life boss nigga, I really ain't gotta say much
Disrespect me one time, I swear to God you gettin' touched
Real niggas that'll kill for me, I ain't really got to do much
Real street nigga came from the bottom, I ain't really got to prove nothing
I dare a nigga try to play me, I'll turn up like I ain't gotta lose nothin'
I dare a nigga try to play me, put his ass on the news or something
All my niggas getting to the guap, like this ain't really nothing new to us
We don't fuck with you fuck niggas, cause all you niggas so fu to us
Hate fucking on one bitch like damn I need me like two of them
Plug front me a hundred bricks, like damn what Imma gon' to do with them
Take them bitches to the trap, why fuck with them get right through with them
These rap niggas be super clown that's why I don't even fool with them!
Where you from in your own hood they don't even respect you
You's a goofy ass nigga, you's a clown ass nigga
In the streets never did nothing special
I'm a real street nigga, I'm a real trap nigga
Started selling crack when I was eleven
Run off with the work, I ain't gotta run off my plug he give me extra
Extra guap, extra cheese. Everything come in extra
Extra guns, extra weed. Nigga I got them weapons
Run up on Fredo then you leave up in a stretcher
Have my Mexicans chop your hands off just to show your ass a lesson
Real trap nigga. I can show you how the move work
Real street nigga. I can show you how that two work
Real trap nigga. Nigga better do your homework
Real street nigga. Go and do your research

[Hook]
Say she want pills Imma feed it to her

Pistol on my waist, he ain't see it showin'
Savage Squad nigga, but I stay Glo'n (Pint of red I stay pourin')
Savage Squad nigga, but I stay Glo'n
Savage Squad nigga, but I stay Glo'n
