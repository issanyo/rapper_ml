[Intro]

*clears throat*
Mic check... Aight, we good then... Run it

[Verse 1]

I’mma live for this shit, I’mma die for this shit
I’mma ride for this shit, but never lie for no bitch, nah

This is what I got, it’s Fly or Die, no sabotage, or espionage
Fuck the governmental spies, they just lying in disguise
See the fire in their eyes, Mask Off; I’mma make ‘em drop like flies

Just like Slim said... When I shoot, I drop a OPP like Scottie Pippen
I am making paper so you haters should quit bitchin’
Hoes already ask for money but I haven’t stick my dick in yet
Ice is dripping off my neck but I ain’t even gettin’ wet

To the mountain top, it’s what I’m plotting to get to
I’mma surpass all you trappers, but ain’t got nothing against you

I’m just better, it’s a fucking fact, take my mask off out in class
Load the clip to the .45 and then I bust it back
Get the fuck up off my back, I rep the U.S. flag
Clip is holding 15 rounds and you bet I’ll make it blast
I’m marksman on the trigger, ‘bout snatch your dog tag
Then I put it on my neck and pop brass ‘til you ain’t intact

[Exit]

Yeah, word to the Military… Risking their lives every single day
Just for our freedom… God Bless your souls
This is Dev the Follower… For those who didn’t know
