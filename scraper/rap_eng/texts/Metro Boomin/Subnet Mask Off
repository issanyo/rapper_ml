[Chorus]
Internet, hack the internet
Internet, hack the internet
Re-percent, gotta re-percent
Place a bet, always hook events
Mask on, subnet mask off
Mask on, subnet mask off
Internet, hack the internet
Place a bet, always hook events

[Verse 1]
CIDR blocks, broadcast is the game
Blasting packets to my enemies' domains
Router bottom, headers that I spoof
It's no surprise I got supplies I got the troops (D.G.)
Data centers, feel my layer deuce
OSI, where I data link the juice
Id Software got em Quake-ing in their boots
Teredo batting on the mobiles call me Bruce
Bruce Wayne, on that blockchain
From the air, go, go on the plane!
WAF off, thats a liability
SQLi with a customized utility

[Chorus]
Internet, hack the internet
Internet, hack the internet
Re-percent, gotta re-percent
Place a bet, always hook events
Mask on, subnet mask off
Mask on, subnet mask off
Internet, hack the internet
Place a bet, always hook events

[Verse 2]
Four core Intel, I smash anything
Pages change, fill the heap with strings
Oh Lord praise him be (spam God)
Hacker team, online status green
My machine, GeForce on extreme
Phish the net, contact mail your friends a
Href from Sagan - filters that I'm breaking
Phaser printers, Teslin in the center
RFIDs I'm cloning - spread like Melanoma
Pop a Soma, sniff a line of K
Spammers fate gotta beat the limit rates
Ain't away, I don't set away
Still awake, Discord chat I flake
Switch I break, bake exception cake
They gang, they gang, we gang
But we are not the same

[Chorus]
Internet, hack the internet
Internet, hack the internet
Re-percent, gotta re-percent
Place a bet, always hook events
Mask on, subnet mask off
Mask on, subnet mask off
Internet, hack the internet
Place a bet, always hook events
