[Hook]
Swag all over my body all on my shoes
Aayy, eh, eh
Killin', I'm killin' these niggas, I'm breaking that news
Aayy, ayyy
Swag all over my body all on my shoes
You know Metro higher than a mountain where my dew
Ay, I got swag all on my motherfucking shoes
You know I got swag all on my motherfucking shoes

[Verse 1]
Bumbaclot pass me the rock
Ayyy, thug life like Pac
Ayyy, 32 rounds in that Glock
Bumbaclots, state trooper tried to catch a nigga with the Glock
Tell 'em mind they business bitch I'm tryna run a shop
Pussy nigga going loose lips so I bought a mop
Anytime they come down at me I get to first like I had to stop
Take me a trip to Colorado to smoke moon rocks
No way, no way
No way, she can't leave me
You can't leave me
She's not from Georgia but she a peach

[Hook]
Swag all over my body all on my shoes
Aayy, eh, eh
Killin', I'm killin' these niggas, I'm breaking that news
Aayy, ayyy
Swag all over my body all on my shoes
You know Metro higher than a mountain where my dew
Ay, I got swag all on my motherfucking shoes
You know I got swag all on my motherfucking shoes

[Verse 2]
I'm swagging from head to toe buzzin'
I got so much weed in my blunt I could make a fucking mullet
You lil' niggas are fake actors we just call ya puppets
I don't move unless it's about money, I jump like ribbit
Rabbit, rabbit, bitch I'm jumping like ribbit
And I'm twice as green, ya dig?
I got hella kids, ya dig?
And they roll my weed, ya dig?
Aayy, ya dig?
Ya dig?
Do ya dig?

[Hook]
Swag all over my body all on my shoes
Aayy, eh, eh
Killin', I'm killin' these niggas, I'm breaking that news
Aayy, ayyy
Swag all over my body all on my shoes
You know Metro higher than a mountain where my dew
Ay, I got swag all on my motherfucking shoes
You know I got swag all on my motherfucking shoes
