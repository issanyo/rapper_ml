[Intro: Momo]
Xanny Xanny
Whoo!

[Hook x4: Momo]
Xanny Xanny, call me Xanta Claus
Xanny, Oxy, or the Adderall

[Verse 1: Momo]
These bitches they mix it with alcohol
Shoot a nigga with a cannon ball
All of my niggas is animals
Eating these rappers like cannibals
Matter of fact, eat me some cannabis
Edible nigga, no passing this
Pedestal nigga, no passing this
Trapping, no check, and no cashing it
Finessing the plug, cut the middleman
The Vyvanse, the Addie, go bag up the Ritalin
You start up the beef and we finish it
Got a bad bitch and her skin tone is that cinnamon
Is that cinnamon, the skin tone is that cinnamon
And she giving me intellect
Young nigga, young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga
Young nigga don't test me
I chill with your bitch and she licking my testes
Your bitch she get messy
Kicking her out like I'm Messi
You know that I'm balling, You know that I'm balling
Go call me the Espy's

[Hook x3: Momo]
Xanny Xanny, call me Xanta Claus
Xanny, Oxy, or the Adderall

[Verse 2: AWEI$]
Chasing money, it's nothing to me
Sorry mama if the cops should book me
For I work, you know they overlook me
Now I saw these bitches and they trying to book me
At the top and I'm looking down
All you niggas looking like some clowns
507, we don't play around
Some of my niggas, put you in the ground
Xannies, Oxies, and the Addies too
Might pop one, I might pop a few
Every night, cooling with my crew
Turning up cuz it's what we do
ZOOTBOYS we going global
On the beat, I'm going loco
Snake niggas, you know that's a no no
Fully auto, we don't do revolvers
Real niggas from the get go
Shot flying better get low
Or them Glock nines give you halos
Them Glock nines give you halos

[Hook x3: Momo]
Xanny Xanny, call me Xanta Claus
Xanny, Oxy, or the Adderall

[Outro: AWEI$ (Momo)]
I got the sack, I got the sack (Xannies) Whoo!
I got the sack, I got the sack (Xannies) Whoo!
