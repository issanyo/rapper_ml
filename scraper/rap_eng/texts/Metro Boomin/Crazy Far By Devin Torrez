[Chorus]
Won't stop until
Mama in her favorite car
You better watch me
Imma be a rockstar
Baby pullin' strings
Do I look like a guitar?
All I know's with God
Imma get crazy far...

[Verse 1]
Boy, I love Sabrina
I don't know why
Maybe it's just because
You better get ready to applause
I give more
Than Mr. Claus
My lyrics are so killer
They belong in a funeral
All I say is thieves
Give me back my dream journal (Ye, yee, yeee)

[Chorus]
Won't stop until
Mama in her favorite car
You better watch me
Imma be a rockstar
Baby pullin' strings
Do I look like a guitar?
All I know's with God
Imma get crazy far...

[Verse 2]
Devin ain't here
He's so late
They say with me
I'm so crazy
I'm gonna be
A legend one day
Boy, you already know
I don't play (ay, ayy, ayyy)

[Chorus]
Won't stop until
Mama in her favorite car
You better watch me
Imma be a rockstar
Baby pullin strings
Do I look like a guitar?
All I know's with God
That's all I NEEEED
