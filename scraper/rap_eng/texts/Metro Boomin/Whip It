[Verse 1: French Montana]
On that blue dot got me movin' lazy
All about that action, all my dogs wavy
Whippin' it left, dip in the knife
Whippin' it right, I'm sippin' on ice
I'm smokin' all night
Give her the pipe, playin' with life
Win it or lose
Runnin' the light, hundred a night
We jump in a cruise
We came out the bottom
We drank out the bottle
We makin' the moves
You know we got it, why would you doubt it?
We never gone lose
