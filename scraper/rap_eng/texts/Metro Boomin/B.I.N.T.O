Me I'm not the one that you wanna come get involved with
Me I'm not the one that you wanna come get involved with!
I'm more the type that you wanna just dip out the club with
Bitch I'm not the one, bitch I'm not the one, bitch I'm not the one

[NOVA]
Not the one for you, not the one for me, no love for no one
Still you gon blow my phone up
I increase your blood flow don't I?
She with me, she probably deep throat, that's my stress reliever
Her body smoking like this reefer, I hit that all weekend (Puff puff pass yeah)
I slay that pussy, then repeat it, I won't cleanse your demons
Girl, best believe it, ain't no secret, you should keep it moving
Please, you should know better, cause love ain't for free
You deserve better, not me, not me

[Hook]
Me I'm not the one that you wanna come get involved with
Me I'm not the one that you wanna come get involved with!
I'm more the type that you wanna just dip out the club with
Bitch I'm not the one, bitch I'm not the one, bitch I'm not the one

[CAMILO]
Girls seeking romance, But boys just want the no pants
Bitch this ain't a slow dance, Show me how a hoe dance
They ask me will I ever love, I tellem bitch no chance
Cause bitch I'm not the one, bitch I'm not the one
BITCH IM NOT THE ONE
Bitch I'm not the one, Bitch I'm not the one
I belong to none, I'm just bout the fun
Wealthy season we killing it, Being careless, we diligent
Whole city be feeling it, Wealthy season stay killing it
Getting tired of dreaming it, eager to start living it
New sound I'm bringing it, All these hoes stay singing it
All these hoes stay singing it, My generation go ignorant
With my kin going ignorant
Let's get into it, not intimate

[Hook]
Me I'm not the one that you wanna come get involved with
Me I'm not the one that you wanna come get involved with!
I'm more the type that you wanna just dip out the club with
Bitch I'm not the one, bitch I'm not the one, bitch I'm not the one
