[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Yo what's poppin nigga it's Lil Boat in this motherfucker
I'm really counting got that shit straight off the boat
I was born on a boat motherfucker I came up on a boat
30,000 dollars on my neck
50,000 you know what I'm saying on my wrist
Niggas know how I'm coming, niggas know how I'm flexing

[Hook: Lil HBK]
Don't flex
Don't flex
Stingray, fast car, Corvette
30K it's only diamonds on my neck
I don't even want the sex just want the neck

[Verse 1: Lil HBK]
I just want the neck
I just want a check, and that's on the set
I just want yo bitch
Posted on my dick, money to the left
Pull up on the scene

In the fucking pussy, like a nigga Jeff
