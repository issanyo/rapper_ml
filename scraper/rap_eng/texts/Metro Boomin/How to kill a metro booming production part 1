(intro, 36 Molly Pillz)

How am i feeling ?
I don't know man

Shot out everybody
Who showed me love one day

I don’t know what to say to these niggas
They all tryna rap but they're wack should be a king to these niggas
Took  pen found  ink in heart spray ink on these niggas
And we will celebrate for sure  ! yeah we gon drink on these niggas
Confidence never ever shrink on these niggas

(hook, 36 Molly Pillz)

Got to get it now
Got to get it now
If i see you in my way
Man u got to get it blow
Never worry bout a girl
Man i worry  bout my friends
Man i worry bout my family
Same blood in our veins

And i’m rollin on that road
Where u cannot fall
I be knowing that i’m cold
So i pray the lord
I be knowing dat i’m cold
So i’m sprayin skrrtt
A few wins in the row
So i thank the Lord

( Verse 1, 36 Molly Pillz)

Used to rap to escape the life i was fuckin living in
Now i rap to conquer the life i be fuckin living in
And i was so mad at Mayane i thought that she was playing games
Realise  was telling me so kindly  she didn’t feel the same
And i’m so sorry for the way i reacted it’s a shame
Wasn’t real thought that was cool to be acting
Like it’s a play
And i don’t ask for forgiveness
If u do God would  forgive me
And i need to be punish for that
For the way that i did it
I got to change be a better man
But i’m rich and got a pretty face
So it’s harder damn i swear it man
Plus might be richer in the coming days (singing)

As u can see i talk shit now
I’m never humble
I don’t sit down
I never crumble
Even with dat John Terry tackle man i never stumble
Shot out Bridge he paved the way
And now i'm not even trusting my uncles
And sometimes i admit   i’m that close from loosing my mind
Then i think about how i’m the realest nigga ever to ride

Think about how my momma raised me
My hood niggas man dey might erase you

Shot out my niggas man dey give me the strength dat i need
Shot out my niggas  they be the definition of who i be
These women got me confused i don’t know i what dey want
«these women got me confused      do not know anymore

(hook)

Got to get it now
Got to get it now
If i see you in my way
Man u got to get it blow
Never worry bout a girl
Man i worry  bout my friends
Man i worry bout my family
Same blood in our veins

And i’m rollin on that road
Where u cannot fall
I be knowing that i’m cold
So i pray the lord
I be knowing dat i’m cold
So i’m sprayin skrrtt
A few wins in the row
So i thank the Lord

(Verse 2, Ace Will)

People talking bout me i don't give a fuck
U can bite my bone i don't need no luck
They just tryna to put me down, cuz they know i got the crown
Man i know you like that sound yeah

Man i be honest yeah i fucked your bitch
Now she's all in my DM's, she want to suck a dick
And i never called her back, i just hit her from the back
Me and my family counting stacks, we ain't never going back

Only fuckin with the real x2
Only fuckin with the day ones yeah X2

Only fuckin with the real x2
Only fuck with the day ones yeah X2
