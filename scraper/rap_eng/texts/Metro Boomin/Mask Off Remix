That girl she druggin she wildin
Feelin alone secluded no island
Say she grown
Making moves she can't live with
World on her shoulders
Mask on to deal with it
Smile on her face so you can't see her pain
The wounds cut deep
So the scars can't erase
The tears fall down her face
But they hard to trace
Make no mistake livin in a world with hate
Just her reflection like a mirror
Showin the world a demonstra tion
She just need to love herself but it's hard to do
Lookin for that love in someone else
It's hard to face the truth
But it's starin right into her eyes
No surprise
Take the mask off she'd realize
The sacrifice ain't worth it
Gotta live ya life
And you ain't livin right
If your truth ain't but a lie
