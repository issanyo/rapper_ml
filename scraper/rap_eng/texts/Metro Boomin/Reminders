[Intro: Forrest Slump]
Oh no, please don't mind us
Ain't no way we'll rise up
I don't need reminders
I don't need reminders
Wanna be a rider
Take yo seat behind us
Nigga make yo mind up...

[Verse 1: Gnarly Nate]
Yeah! yeah! yeah!
I'm back bitch!
With a vengeance
Oh yes, it's sweet as
The pussy of my preference
Pac wasn't kidding about it
Lemme tell ya
Where ever the fuck niggas at
We'll be elsewhere
Legends in the making
We The Worse Generation
It's The Golden Age of Piracy
Reincarnated
If I want it, bitch I'll have it!
It is all for the taking
Yes that includes your life
Our weapons never on safety
Never gave a fuck about me
Why start now?
Funny how my life picked up
Once I dropped out
Got a taste of some freedom
Now I'm bout to chow down
We bout to chow dowwwn
Fucking clowns!
Bitch

[Hook: Forrest Slump]
Oh no, please don't mind us
Ain't no way we'll rise up
I don't need reminders
I don't need reminders
Wanna be a rider
Take yo seat behind us
Nigga make yo mind up
I don't need reminders
How these niggas quick to change
Wasn't with me through the pain
You a buncha liars
I don't need reminders
Lately shit ain't been the same
All this world has done is drain
Everything inside us
I don't need reminders

[Verse 2: L$Drew]
I grew up a screw up
I grew up a screw up
I grew up a screw up
I grew up a screw up
Me and them are not the same
My brain learn to block the pain
For my crew I'll take the blame
Take a bullet! take a life!
All my niggas down for life
Know some niggas shoulda died
Probably will if I'm high
PEW! PEW!
Watch em fly
Let em bleed til he dry
Betcha nobody cried
Only the real survive
Mom, I ain't living right
No need to feel
I'm off a pill
And I just might kill tonight...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Forrest Slump]
Oh shit!
I've been needing this beat
Lately all this bullshit
Ain't been speaking to me
Change my lifestyle up
Straight deleting the beef
Like a nigga went vegan
It reek when we chiefin'
On my way to the money
Ain't no pussy intervening
On my young OG shit
Weed and Olde English
My life consist of blood
Semen and demons
Forrest Slump ain't
Never been for the squeamish
I know you living a lie
I think we living to die
If you want a piece of the pie
Give me a reason to ride
Ah shit!
Here we go with the nonsense
It be embarrassing now
To say we conscious
Niggas tainted the name
And now we monstrous
Come on let it out
What's on your conscience?...
My whole life's in shambles
Listen to a real nigga ramble
Took a hold of that pot by the handle
If they run off in the spot, we goin rambo!

AH YEAH!
