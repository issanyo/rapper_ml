[Bridge] Merkules
3D glasses with tunnel vision, I'm something different
I live my life from the one condition, that's fuck the system
It's like I'm tired of doin' tones of bricks, so I'm jugging liquor
See me out there in public, and now they wanna picture

[Verse] Merkules
Okay, that's fine with me, I rely on the irony
Labels still tryna sign with me, honestly I'm still out of reach
'Cause where I'm from I run the scene in it's entirety
While 'ya all still in the bleachers with your popcorn tryna find a seat
This rap shit will make you feel like you the hierarchy
But little did you know that I been dealin' with anxiety
I call my parents up so I can hear 'em say they proud of me
'Ya all think I'm livin' lavish, man, it's same as it's cut out to be
I'm playin', now we order plates of steak when we go out to eat I'm somewhere in Belize, smokin' weed on the balcony
We gettin' money, makin' fans know it's all good
We upgraded from old carpet to hardwood
It's Merk

[Chorus] 2x Stevie Ross
I've been stressin', I've been runnin' out of patience
Drink tequila every night, don't need no chaser
We on the road, doin' shows, collecting paper
Started out local, now it's major

[Bridge] Stevie Ross
All black diamonds in my bracelet
I just wanna be my inner paline
I'mma get rich and I can taste it
So easy trynna tell what I can't be
Tunnel Vision on these haters
Tunnel Vision on these haters
Tunnel Vision on these haters
Tunnel Vision on these haters

[Verse 2] Merkules
Deluring these fuckin' rappers, I'm burnin' a couple backwoods
Determined, I'm movin' forward, the swervin' ain't goin' backwards
I'm the punch line general, you see me in salute, the renegade, drinkin' lemonade, they see I got the juice..
I see 'em hatin', I'm watchin' through my binoculars, it's groundhog day, when you winnin', and then they start poppin' up
I called to bluff 'cause I'm strapped up like an armored truck, you get distracted, they cut you, just like a barber drunk
They want beef then I roast 'em, it's like an Arby's lunch, 'y'all drinkin' coolers like losers inside the party bus
It makes me wonder, if you know what it's like, to have to struggle every month, I couldn't focus at night, nah
Collecting paper, it escalates to your friends are haters, I'm lookin' down on these pussies, I took the elevator
I ain't with the fuck shit, I'm used to it, I see it, now these people talkin' shit are actin' cool cause it's convenient
Nah

[Bridge] Merkules
Yah
Stompdown Killaz 4 life
Twenty seventeen
Yah

[Chorus] 2x Stevie Ross
I've been stressin', I've been runnin' out of patience
Drink tequila every night, don't need no chaser
On the road, doin' shows, collecting paper
Started out local, now it's major

[Bridge] Stevie Ross
All black diamonds in my bracelet
I just wanna be my inner paline
I'mma get rich and I can taste it
So easy trynna tell what I can't be
Tunnel Vision on these haters
Tunnel Vision on these haters
Tunnel Vision on these haters
Tunnel Vision on these haters
