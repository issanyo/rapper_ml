[Intro:]
I tell em we'll be on top

[Verse 1:]
You must be the D
Got you all up in yo feelin's
Every time I go you be on my line
Tryna get it at me
Fuckin' you, you tweet it
Bitch, when I roll ova, roll me one
Grab my keys, hit my blunt
Spin that ass so you know I'm gone

[Hook:]
It's back to the streets
Chasin' that money, money
The almighty dolla
Pussy so good that she know
That them nigga gon' holla
Head go so crazy
I swear that the bitch is a scholar
But it's still money ova bitches
AAAAh, MOB
Still money ova bitches, nigga
MOB

[Verse 2:]
If you hit the street, then the money come
Sippin' that mighty water
My bitch, she picture perfect
Mona Lisa, She thick like she come from Florida
I got Mercedes, mind of Forgie

Baby mommas want me
API imported, back to back, no portions
Baby, you so gorgeous, help me build a fortune
Shoes is 1500, bet you can't afford it
Money ova bitches, money ova bitch ass niggas
No time fo' yo feelin's
My coupe ain't got time fo' no ceilin's
I'm in the kitchen like a chemist
Cookin' up them dinners
We want...
... Money, the dolla sign
She send that shit, need me
She wanna meet me
Maybe later on this evenin'
But right now we just steady leanin'

[Hook:]
It's back to the streets
Chasin' that money, money
The almighty dolla
Pussy so good that she know
That them nigga gon' holla
Head go so crazy
I swear that the bitch is a scholar
But it's still money ova bitches
AAAAh, MOB
Still money ova bitches, nigga
MOB
