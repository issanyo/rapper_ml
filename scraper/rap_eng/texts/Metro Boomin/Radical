Tiger stripe, Alexander Wang and Balenci
Off white nigga I just came in that Fendi
Purp type bitches, I just came like I'm Jimi
Out of sight, all this fucking brain on my agendi
Matte white mid, got it wrapped around a rover
Out my mind nigga, I'm so gone off that soda
Fuck the soda rover, I just poured up a 4 up
Yellow yellow mojo, I got mojo, I got yellow
Better not have no panties on the next time you see me
Hydroplaning, grab the tooly, futuristic treatment
Fuck the fame nigga I'm walking around with that semi
Fuck the plane nigga I'm bungee jumping out so freely
