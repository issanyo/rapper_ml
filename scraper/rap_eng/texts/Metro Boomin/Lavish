[Chorus]
I see eyes, in the hills
Need a cabinet, filled with pills
Need a house, filled with hoes
With the floors, made of gold
Need a safe, filled with guns
I need women, more than one
Need a Wraith, just to crash it
I'm tryna live lavish

[Verse 1]
I'm tryna live lavish
Live like every day my last, shit
She say she love my old tape
This is way better than my last shit
Get rich overnight, I can't exaggerate
I can't wait to move my momma in a better place
I took my women to L.A. to Californicate
We damn near arguin' every time that she go away
Plus these hoes wanna fuck on me
But I won't let em' fuck on me
I know these bitches be scandalous, I can't handle it
So I let my woman handle it, she gon' vandle it

[Chorus]
I see eyes, in the hills
Need a cabinet, filled with pills
Need a house, filled with hoes
With the floors, made of gold
Need a safe, filled with guns
I need women, more than one
Need a wraith, just to crash it
I'm tryna live lavish

[Bridge]
Every day, I'm slappin'
Keep a liquor bottle in my lap
And I keep a drug sack in my bag
Trap house in my bag

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I see eyes, in the hills
Need a cabinet, filled with pills
Need a house, filled with hoes
With the floors, made of gold
Need a safe, filled with guns
I need women, more than one
Need a wraith, just to crash it
I'm tryna live lavish (Ye)
