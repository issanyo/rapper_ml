[Intro: Joey Bada$$]:
All Amerikkkan Bada$$ man, April 7, right?
April 7, 2017, that's in like three weeks man
I'm bout to blast off with them

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]:
Blast off, blast off
Oh it's that... This beat is so hard bruh!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay
Finally, got a piece of the profit
Wine and cheese, in the seat by the cockpit
I ain't mean for yo' bitch to be watchin
Eying me, she kept eying me
Everyday, we just making deep profits
Money long, I'm gonna need some deep pockets
Hands are to the ceiling, when I'm in the building
How you make a living, hm?
Lately never chillin'
Mind is on a million things I gotta do
Ladies want me, when there's no time for chillin'
No time for you
I been on a different type of time
I live like the rest, a different type of grind
I'm on South Beach like Tony Montan'
Feelin' like the whole water's mine, and I
Sit back let yo mouth run
No man knows when this time gon' come
Every action think about the outcome
Cause they never outrun no bullet from a gun
Don't ask Malcolm, that's how come
That's any real nigga really bout some
When you in the field, nigga don't play dumb
Better keep your eyes peeled, and the rear view [?]
