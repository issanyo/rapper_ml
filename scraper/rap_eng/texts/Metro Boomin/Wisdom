[Chorus]
Can't be out here just giving all this wisdom
If niggas don't seem to believe my mission
Can't see myself sitting inside no prison
No need for money I got tunnel vision
All I see is me keep on getting richer
That's when I got that 20/20 vision
If niggas don't seem to believe my mission
Can't be out here giving 'em all my wisdom

[Verse]
Young niggas better stay the fuck from out of my way
Both of us could draw the first shot, it be like the tiebreak
Ask my BMW dealer, we like them high rate
I like straight skeezers who like Dave East, PNB Rock, and Wale
Though this ain't no movie I got Jason V
I got Michael Myers right on my waist
But that won't stop her from doming tonight's Mayor on Elm Street
At my house and my new V right out in my driveway, huh
Remember I'm the best big vocabulary in the stretch six
I don't stress, I'm rich, I'm Ashy Larry in the flesh, bitch
You haters busters, you Dave & Buster's, I'm David Justice
Translation: I'm making Halle Berry my next pitch
I ain't one of them you just could mess with, the Devil naked
Up under that blue dress, that's like my death wish
Rape her, contract an infection, if you scary
Take you back to the essence, obituaries are actual confessions
Today's lesson: we living in a great rap depression
To make a record takes more than just to stay black and reckless
Do you have anything to say? That's impressive
Do I listen to you at dinner and playback at breakfast?
Hmm, do you know what a classic is?
Do you know the name of the place where your pastor is?
Don't you know the rap game is based on sacrilege
Man, I'm being petty
Don't you know that war's an ancient acronym that stands for "We Ain't Ready"?
And while I'm combing the town I could travel blocks
First place that it all went down was Fraggle Rock, now it's the gavel drop
Before I had them hammer handles I had them handles
Coulda been in the NBA 'stead of rapping had I had them hops
9-8, I got stung by a dragonfly, draggin' a mop
So nowadays, I stay sharp as daggers while I'm stabbing the drop
I keep a Mini Cooper that always follows behind me
I call it Tavis Smiley, that's 'cause it's black and small
I hate your cigarettes, I hate the smell of Black and Milds
You hate me that's crazy I hate to tell you we at the top
I ain't heard a decent bar in months, bruh
I'm tired of hearing 'bout your stinking cars and all your dumb trucks
How you be with stars and how your gun bust
I'm here to rain on all you deer, young bucks, high and drunk fucks
Won't feel a thing we gon' make this shit quick and painless
Lifestyle of the rich and gainless
Right now you standing in the same place every day with a different payment
Existing in rented space
If niggas ain't gonna innovate then the game gon' renovate
Okay, you got it, great go for a K
Them thangs on the interstate
That's cool, but I choose to not leave the booth till I see pain on the interface
When we pass, our possessions ain't gon' reach the masses
Fuck yo' Audemar, your Patek Philippe, and your glasses
Bitch

[Chorus]
Can't be out here just giving all this wisdom
If niggas don't seem to believe my mission
Can't see myself sitting inside no prison
No need for money I got tunnel vision
All I see is me keep on getting richer
That's when I got that 20/20 vision
If niggas don't seem to believe my mission
Can't be out here giving 'em all my wisdom
