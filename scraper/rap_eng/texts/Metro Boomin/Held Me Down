[Intro]
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been running from my problems
I've been running from you
Girl, all this money, all these things don't feel the same without you
I can't trust these others girls, I got a feeling 'bout you
Even though I'm doing well, I lose my touch without you
I hate to hurt you, cameras showing everything that I do
Piece of shit, I got a side bitch and I lie to her too
My mama asking 'bout you, and I'm finna lie to her too
I blew up and got lost in the sauce, and changed up on you

[Chorus]
But when nobody else was around
She always held me down
She always held me down
She always held me down
Way before I found my sound
She kept my feet on the ground
She always held me down
She always held me down

[Verse 1]
I've been living life on the road
Feeling lonely, heart is turning cold
I be covered up in sold out clothes
Feeling empty, doing sold out shows
Use the drugs to cover up my emotions (abusing drugs)
Every time you see me, I'm either rolling or smoking (I'm rollin' up)
Everybody love me now, only you make me feel important
When we settle down, everything you buy gon' be imported
All of your friends, they told you, "Don't fuck with a artist"
When I tell you what my body count is, that gon hit you the hardest

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been running from my problems
I've been running from you
Girl, all this money, all these things don't feel the same without you
I can't trust these others girls, I got a feeling 'bout you
Even though I'm doing well, I lose my touch without you
I hate to hurt you, cameras showing everything that I do
Piece of shit, I got a side bitch and I lie to her too
My mama asking 'bout you, and I'm finna lie to her too
I blew up and got lost in a sauce, and changed up on you

[Chorus]
But when nobody else was around
She always held me down
She always held me down
She always held me down
Way before I found my sound
She kept my feet on the ground
She always held me down
She always held me down

[Verse 2]
Whenever they took my music for a joke
Whenever I ever had my back against the ropes
When I was down nand out with no hope
She was always down from the get-go
She was always down, stayed ten toes
Lost my girl, found a thousand hoes
She a good girl, don't work on a pole
If I need it, she would stash my pole
She paid for all the dinners when I was broke
If I needed, she would hide my dope
Girl, I know you still wearing my clothes
I know you think about me when you're alone
I know you think about texting my phone
I wish you would give in and just let go
I'm happy I found out you was at my show
You're more than my girl
You're part of my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been running from my problems
I've been running from you
Girl, all this money, all these things don't feel the same without you
I can't trust these others girls, I got a feeling 'bout you
Even though I'm doing well, I lose my touch without you
I hate to hurt you, cameras showing everything that I do
Piece of shit, I got a side bitch and I lie to her too
My mama asking 'bout you, and I'm finna lie to her too

I blew up and got lost in a sauce, and changed up on you

[Chorus]
But when nobody else was around
She always held me down
She always held me down
She always held me down
Way before I found my sound
She kept my feet on the ground
She always held me down
She always held me down
