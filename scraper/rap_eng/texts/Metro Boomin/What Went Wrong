[Hook: K9]
When I step up to the plate they know whats up
Home run hitters, knock em out the park
Now they start quitting when they hear the bark
Green shells bouta knock him off his cart

[Verse 1: K9]
Ring bells when I step up in the ring
I thought I told your ass, last song I'll be the king
I bet this song make a nigga change his mind
What went wrong when they asked me for a rhyme?
Written in stone when they catch me at the grave
A nigga this cold shouldn't ever leave the cage
She asked to hit the blunt, don't know where her mouths been
It all went wrong when I picked up a pen
Now the hits banging cause I figured out the flow
Only thing next is I'm trying to get a boat
Cross seven seas on a dream giving hope
Jeans full of cream when I hit her with a quote
Float so high I could sleep on the cloud
Tell that hoe "bye" when she starts to run her mouth
Top dog flow like a nigga got the cheats
You could be the GOAT, every lion needs to eat

[Hook]
