[Verse: Big K.R.I.T.]
There I go again, there I go again trying to take it work
Everything I say, everything I say I put it on a shirt
Maaaaaaaaan
If I keep this ima get everything I want
Keep doing what I’m doing
Cuz im doing what these other niggas don’t
Ugh
Shit was crazy been crazy
I’m just trying to mix the flow with the flava
Keep it louder than cable, ugh
Whippin till Oprah my neighbor
If you ain’t scoring all the points
Or winning in the finals them labels will trade ya
If a nigga can't respect the stats and you balling out the trap them niggas is haters, ugh
Ain’t no reason just to flash tho
Wood grain on the dashboard
I been shittin’ on these non believers
Money made me an asshole
Walking round the bank asking all the bank tellers
"Why so serious?"
They only know me by my government nowadays and they way too curious
How he getting money money? ugh
He deposit like its nothing, ugh
I’m the last dragon breathing, ugh
Def Jam kept me in the dungeon, ugh
Now I’m on the dough
On the grind
Of the boy
Break it down
Mirror mirror mirror on the wall
Who the coldest MC around?
Creeping crawling bumping sounds
Got more TV than a lounge
Bottle service white and brown
So much drank that I can drown
Stand on the back of these couches
Shout out to DJ they shout us
The love us with more than them vouchers
Its crazy the industry doubt us
So I’m picking up the pieces
President starch and the creases
Make it where they gotta see me
Pay me just to come to meetings
Ain’t nothing change, ain’t nothing changes, ain’t nothing changed at all
I’m still multi till the sun die and I’m doing this for my dawg
Krizzle

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
They holla krizzle, krizzle, krizzle, krizzle
Like that there
They holla krizzle, krizzle, krizzle, krizzle
One time now
They holla krizzle, krizzle, krizzle, krizzle
Ugh
12 for 12
I’m 12 for 12
I’m 12 for 12
Krizzle, krizzle, krizzle, krizzle
Ugh
They holla krizzle, krizzle, krizzle, krizzle
Ugh
They holla krizzle, krizzle, krizzle, krizzle
Let's go
