YNGDMND - El Chapo Drip (Ric Flair Drip Remix)

[Intro]
This shit ain’t about El Chapo...
I’m smokin green so she rollin’ me them backwoods...
King Lil G, what up
I’m reppin monterrey

[YNGDMND]
Who the king of the coke? That’ll be El Chapo
Who’s puttin 50 or more? Might be El Chapo
Ak47’s, Walkie talkies on our hands
Desert eagle on a side, fuck around and you will die

Didn’t really want to do this cause i’ll come up with dope rhymes
Homie i’m ‘bout that real
Yeah, i’m really bout my grind
Ak47’s, Diamond Rolex watch it shine
Yeah, you can spread the word i rhyme
I’m barely 21, hope I really get co-signed
I’m a hot nigga that nigga beatin’ up time
Bodybaggin every beat
I’m the one who run it deep
Though its funny how i’m rappin’ and trappin while y’all asleep
I like me thick ass bitches with digits pass me ya’ll snapchats
If you gon show me then show me what you about?
Fill my DMs up with them pics
And get this dick
Shout out to rappers with grammar
I’m doing mine (Bang!)
Fuckin with that lead homeboy you gon end up dyin’
Don’t believe in me
I just told you, I wasn’t lyin’
Cocaine like Alaska
Though this weed from East L.A
Bout to watch this blow
Cause you know this gon be fire

[Outro]
King Lil G, bro you really bout that fire

But its nothin’ like a sucio party, aye
It ain’t nothin’ like a sucio party

Haha
