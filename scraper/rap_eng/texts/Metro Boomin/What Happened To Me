[Verse 1]
Same old shit, ain't a damn thing changed
Colombia was a hit, salute Ross and Birdman
And Gucci, but I got more bricks, nigga
Plus I oversee, every brick in zone six, nigga
I can get the way I'm at and go overseas and get 'em
I make all kind of juugs, I'm a real quick flipper
Why should I do straight business when the world full of snitches
Other rappers misguide you, but I'm out here, nigga
And rap shit flop the streets, you goin' right back in 'em
That's why I never love the block, I keep it real my nigga
You can't sell dope forever, but you can If you're smart
Most niggas too greedy, couldn't play their part

[Hook]
My school teacher wanna know what happened to me
My grand mom wanna know what happened to me
My baby momma wanna know what happened to me
My life ain't been the same since I touched these streets

[Bridge]
I can't come home, I gotta keep grindin', keep hustlin', juug!
They banked up, take them bricks, they on the way

[Verse 2]
I've sold all these drugs, all my momma keep stressin'
She listen to the music, say I'm finessin' and flexin'
Ask me why I buy this Rolex and high-priced necklace
She don't understand this life, I'm delieverin' a message
Damn momma, you don't know the streets dependin' on me
My grandma cryin' every day, she worry 'bout me
Some niggas shot up the house, but they be dead within a week
I heard Young Scooter rap, but they don't know streets
I don't walk in every club, I do nothing for free
Keep them shooters with me, I know these niggas plottin' on me
Finesse king, I see through robbery
Rap about so much dope, they try to charge me

[Hook]

[Outro]
Real street nigga, ain't no flowers in me, Black Migo Gang, we count up checks
Juug! Juug!
