[Intro]
(808 Mafia)
Check, check, check, che- oh I got it
Metro Boomin want some more nigga

[Verse 1]
All my niggas some junkies, they keep that bread on 'em dawg
Yo lil ho is a monkey, she got a head on her, dawg
Caught a flight outta London, I can't see nothin' but stars
It don't fuck with my conscience I serve my auntie that raw
Fell asleep at the gamblin' house with that heater right on me
And I got me some stripes like I keep Adidas on me
And I don't believe hype, all my soda get spiked
I shake the Codeine and Sprite cause that's just the way of life

[Hook]
I'm a monster on these hoes, I'mma monster
I can't be scared of none you niggas, ya'll some snitches
I got some girls that claim they straight but now they kissin'
These bitches kissin', tryna get my dick a hickey
I'm a monster on these hoes, I'mma monster
I can't be scared of none you niggas, ya'll some snitches
I got some girls that claim they straight but now they kissin'
These bitches switchin', tryna get my dick a hickey
And I say fuck all the rules, I'd rather fuck your baby momma
And I say bring all your tools cause I'm ready for that drama
And I know I'm a young gunner ain't worried about karma
And I'm just livin' my life and I'mma get me some money

[Verse 2]
I'm young Freddy Krueger, I promote prostitution
These niggas come up snoozin' cause they ladies out here choosin'
I know your dog hoes back in style
These hoesâ€™ll smash on one of your niggas and be very proud
Wow
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I'm gone pull up on these hoes
Young nigga trappin out the ghost
Choppin' like Kung Fu
Used to wanna fuck 2 now I wanna fuck the crew
Got bad bitches in the rear
Me and young Metro trappin out lear
Some fresh new gear made a bitch disappear
Some fresh pack of mollies make the bitch go to work
Some lean in the kush make the pussy squirt
I'mma fuck her throat when she get home from church
Some real good head, make a nigga call back
Chasin' that cheese, you ain't nothin' but a rat
Free band gang, nigga pull up on a flex
Bitch got knocked up, then she got whacked
I'm talkin bout murkin' that pussy like blaat!

[Hook]
I'm a monster on these hoes, I'mma monster
I can't be scared of none you niggas, ya'll some snitches
I got some girls that claim they straight but now they kissin'
These bitches kissin', tryna get my dick a hickey
I'm a monster on these hoes, I'mma monster
I can't be scared of none you niggas, ya'll some snitches
I got some girls that claim they straight but now they kissin'
These bitches switchin', tryna get my dick a hickey
And I say fuck all the rules, I'd rather fuck your baby momma
And I say bring all your tools cause I'm ready for that drama
And I know I'm a young gunner ain't worried about karma
And I'm just livin' my life and I'mma get me some money

[Outro]
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I'm gon' pull up on these hoes
Young nigga trapping out the ghost
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I'm gon' pull up on these hoes
Young nigga trapping out the ghost
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
