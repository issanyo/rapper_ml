[Hook]
Pourin' up in traffic in that foreign
I don't want ya bitch man she boring
All white coke like it's snowing
Yeah I'm in my glory, see me glo'n
Brand new chopper and it's handsome
Hollow tip bullets got him dancin'
Came a long way from a kitchen
Now a nigga sleepin' in a mansion

[Verse 1]
Came a long way from gang banging on the block
Robbin' niggas with that Tommy on dummy
Now I got a couple trap houses, couple pent houses
Couple AKs, lotta bitches, lotta of money
A couple face shots make 'em fall back
Two Nines strapped they ready for combat
Finessed you out your bricks so don't call back
You ready for a war and shit I'm with that)
I don't want your bitch man she too basic
Yea, I'm gettin' money like I'm Caucasian
See I don't fuck with niggas, man, they too fugazy
Savage Squad Records man, we too crazy

[Verse 2]
Woke up feelin like superman
30k up in my pocket, gun up in my hand
Coke so white that it need a tan
Coke so white it's with the Ku Klux Klan
Owe me money, you don't pay off wit ya head
"I'll kill 'em for ya Fredo!"  that's what my shooters said
"Glah! Glah! Glah! Glah!"
That's what my Rugers said
Kill a nigga then go laugh about it, then I pop a Xan'
Pull up smokin' kush, sippin' on this fuckin' high tech
Posted up with the gang on this fuckin' squad shit
Fredo trap ain't doin' numbers man I call that nonsense
Rerockin' remixin' just to get a profit
Squad
