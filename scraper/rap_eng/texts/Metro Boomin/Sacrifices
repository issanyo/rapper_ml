[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh
(Metro Boomin want some more nigga)

[Verse 1]
Blue hundreds all on the mattress
We gon' role play like a actress
Money's a mess on the table
Eyes on that essex and cable
Wanna ride you like a wave
Baby I'm feeling your wave
You could get this anyway
I don't think it's just a phase
Count up that money we sexing in
Count up that money we sexing in
Count up that money we sexing in
Count up that money we sexing in
We spending quality time now
I'm taking issues aside now
I'm gon' run back on your mind now
I'll make you mine, make you mine

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not my M.O to fall in love
But fucking around with me is dangerous
The lines are blurry now, this isn't lust
But you like it (but you like it)
And I like it (and I like it)

[Chorus]
Never known you had it so bad
Never knew I'd do you so right
Never felt this feeling so fast
Never knew it was worth the sacrifice
Never known you had it so bad
Never knew I'd do you so right
Never felt this feeling so fast
Never knew it was worth the sacrifice

[Verse 2]
Second round, can you last tonight?
Spin me round and leave it inside
E-E-Extra loud, every time we play
Watch me dance around all over your face
I'm, yeah, I'ma ride shotgun with you
I took a shot with just you
He gon' pull up in the Chevy
He gon' blow up like a levy
We gon' lay up like a headboard
Do all the shit that you ask for

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not my M.O, to fall in love
But fucking around with me is dangerous
The lines are blurry now, this isn't lust
But you like it (but you like it)
And I like it (and I like it)
(Sacrifices)

[Chorus]
Never known you'd had it so bad
Never knew I'd do you so right
Never felt this feeling so fast
Never knew it was worth the sacrifice
Never known you'd had it so bad
Never knew I'd do you so right
Never felt this feeling so fast
Never knew it was worth the sacrifice

[Breakdown]
Sacrifices
Sac-sacrifices

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna touch you if you let me keep you up
I'm gon' show you what it's like to be loved
I'm gon' treat you just the way that you deserve
I'm gonna touch you just the way that you deserve
I'm gon' take you where you've never been before
I'm gon' hold ya like you outta be held
I'm gonna kiss you, pin you up against the wall
I'm gonna give you some place warm to lay your head, ohh

[Outro]
I will not be ignored
