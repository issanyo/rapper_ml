Aye i'm geeked up off the lean
Got the goons with me and they mean
Shoot a nigga if he ever try me
You can't stop me, from collecting my green
All y'all actors like charlie sheen
Eat the booty like some roast beef
I'm perfect no one can roast me
Boy don't lie to me
Put a bullet in your knees
Stick it in her butt like some keys
Hermes belt cost a couple G's
I'm just tryna get my cheese
When i die imma be on Tee's
RIP to my niggas, y'all finally free
Steal everything you have i'm a thief
Imma pirate but i never sailed out to sea
Im the captain now, Somali
Turn my hood into call of duty
Im the realest and the truest their will ever be
Imma ride for my niggas till the very end of me
You said you gon do somethin nigga we gon see
May the lord have mercy for all my enemies
