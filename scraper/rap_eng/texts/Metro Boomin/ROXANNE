[Verse 1: Father]
I can't begin man, but come fuck with the boy, what you want what you need?
Lets get to this money, enjoy while there's only one mouth to feed
Red like it's on me, yeah highway soo many pretty young thotties
I can't be your man, but fuck with your boy and this dick from the room to the lobby
Call me poppy, give me sloppy
Mix the xan with the roxi
My mama told me to slow down
Just see how far the rabbit hole goes down
Don't ask me why your hoe chose down
