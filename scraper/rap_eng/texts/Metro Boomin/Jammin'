Yeah
I do it for the sport
For the sport
Haha

Uh
Jammin', jammin’, jammin' like Bob Marley's cousin
Pop yo bitches stomach while you fucking cuddling
You scream that she got a bun up in the oven
Now that bun is toast in case you fucking wondering, wooh
Then I hit your temple damn your brain disgusting wooh
I’m just killing tracks you know this shit ain't nothing new
Got handouts for all my people that be in a pinch
Say you ain't jealous but bitch you greener than the Grinch
Jammin', jammin', jammin' like Bob Marley's cousin
You'd think I’m Jamaican when I get to puffin’
Got the munchies, pussy in my fucking lunch tin
Throw the residue up in the fucking dustbin, wooh
Look inside the dustbin you see fucking nothing, wooh
Jammin', jammin’, jammin' like Bob Marley's cousin, wooh
Jammin', jammin’, jammin' meet me in the section, wooh
I just hit the gas station got me protection, wooh
Jammin', jammin', jammin', jammin', jammin', jammin'
Shit I'm whipping yellow but this shit ain't custard
Don't be touching, please bitch don't be touching
This shit right here will get your fucking granny buzzing
She sent me a text saying that she's late
Fuck it man it's time to make my great escape
No boo, no boo, no boo, no boo, no boo, no boo
She said not that "late" and she'll be home by 8
Told her it ain't funny when she fucks with me
I ain't having kids because that shit ain't free
Except for my dad I guess he got away
But that shit a story for another day

Jammin', jammin', jammin' like Bob Marley's cousin
Jammin', jammin', jammin' like Bob Marley's cousin
Jammin', jammin', jammin' like Bob Marley's cousin
Pop yo bitches stomach while you fucking cuddling
