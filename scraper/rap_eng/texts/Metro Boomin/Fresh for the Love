Turn a Bent to a Block
For the love of the money, for the love nigga (hold up, hold up)
For the love of the money, for the love nigga (hold up, hold up)

For the love of the money, for the love (hold up, hold up)

[Verse 1: Future]
I'ma pull up on you now with a hundred pack of diamonds
And a two mini shot with my nigga BB simon[?]
I'm in camouflage denim with them stars on my shoulders
I got Lawyers watching Lawyers, I got Killers watching Killers
I'm in Rick James Leather with them bad ass bitches
I got bitches on bitches and in that new leather
I was rocking new Versace when them niggas was in Tru's
I was selling dope finessing way back in High School
We will pull up again, free my nigga Big Rube
Put the Molly in the lean, I got sauce I got juice
Rich gang nigga rocking two thousand dollar shoes
I'ma Free Band nigga, so a nigga never lose
