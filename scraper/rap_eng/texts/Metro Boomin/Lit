Haha
Roll up my weed as soon as the day start
Get me a pound and I break it apart
Kush on my clothes, smell the green in my car
Ain't coming close, you smell me from afar
Time after time, I keep smoking that herb
Joint after joint, I must be on the verge
Of overdosing, I be on that loud
Speeding me up, while I'm slowing you down
I just got back from an overseas trip
Smoking with Ty, he got me high as shit
Cause we keep nothing but good in our J
Repping our gang and we mob everyday
Break down an ounce, put it right on tray
Ain't saving nothing, we smoke everything
Light up a joint, let it stink up the place
Or hit the bong, load the smoke in your face

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Imma get money, nigga, Imma get money
I'm a real nigga so Imma keep it real
And I love getting high
(love getting high)
And I love getting high
(love getting high)
Imma get money, nigga, Imma get money
I'm a real nigga so Imma keep it real
And I love getting high
(love getting high)
And I love getting high
(love getting high)


Break it down and roll another one
I could get anything I want
I told her "You should bring a friend for the crew"(friend for the crew)
Hear 'em talk but they ain't want it though
I'm in the Hall of Fame of smoke
Cause everybody that I'm with, get high too
(get high too)
Only rolling in a Wiz Khalifa paper(Khalifa paper )
Owtt Gang G Pen, smell the vapor(smell the vapor)
Take it to the head before I walk up to the plane
I'll probably get so fucking high
Won't even know my fucking name
You got to be a pro, if you wanna get this blow
Never inhale, teach you how to hit this smoke
And I'm never running out of it
(running out of it)
Kush smoke, got a lot of it
(got a lot of it)
Smoke like we hit the lottery
(hit the lottery)
Seen Snoop, he was proud of me
(he was proud of me)
Won't go broke cause I never spend
(never spend)
If them hoes don't smoke, don't let 'em in
(don't let 'em in)
Imma get money, nigga, Imma get money
I'm a real nigga so Imma keep it real
And I love getting high
(love getting high)
And I love getting high
(love getting high)
Imma get money, nigga, Imma get money
I'm a real nigga so Imma keep it real
