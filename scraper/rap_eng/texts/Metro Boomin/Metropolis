I'm gully oh golly (x3)

[Verse]
Why they wanna go and that love huh?
Cuz I was sittin and I was chillin with that love huh?
They never like it when you sittin on the other side
They wanna pull you down like anchor when you on the rise
Don't ever be surprised
Some niggas just don't know
Yea they could be the guys
Some niggas just don't grow
Try to give em water
And all they want is liquor
Try to get em better
All they really get is sicker
You niggas do not get it
Ima help you understand
You wanna rise, hot air
Cut a sandbag
Have that fire in the hole
Gotta stand back
Whip ya wrist up
Work it like mad
Like asylum shit
Everyday livin
Yea we Wildin bitch
I'm styling shit
I'm 2 years ahead
If we all goin down then that's two years a head
So it's motherfuck the Feds
Cuz this bread too important
You whores is for the taking right
Holup None of y'all is taken right
Fuck them niggas
I ain't tryna take ya life
Man fuck them them niggas
Yea I'm tryna take ya wife

[Hook]
I'm gully oh golly
I live in metropolis
Ain't it so obvious (x3)
Ain't it so obvious (x3)
