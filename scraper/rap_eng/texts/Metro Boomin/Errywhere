Nigga I be everywhere
You ain’t never there
Every time I look up see the same bitches everywhere
Can’t wait to get this money, I’m gon’ take my niggas everywhere
Take them pistols everywhere, I got hitters everywhere
I got bitches everywhere, take them bitches everywhere
Every time I look up see the same bitches everywhere
Bitch I come from DC, ask about us, we ain’t scary here
Take them pistols everywhere, I got hitters everywhere

[Verse 1]
I’m on top of the mountains and I’m screaming fuck the world
My bitch so bad she look just like a powerpuff girl
1942, come and take shots ‘til you hurl
I wake up like “who you?”, I got some missed calls from my girl
Chain lighting up the room like I’m a damn electrician
I got some little buddies tryna see wassup witcha
And one thing that I learned is that ya never trust niggas
And if I have a daughter she can’t fuck with fuck niggas
They be like “ay Glizzy, why you still ain’t mainstream?”
I’m loyal to my niggas, bitch we got that same dream
Underground king, rest in peace to Pimp C
Bitch I am a boss, can’t let a nigga pimp me

[Hook]
Nigga I be everywhere
You ain’t never there
Every time I look up see the same bitches everywhere
Can’t wait to get this money, I’m gon’ take my niggas everywhere
Take them pistols everywhere, I got hitters everywhere
I got bitches everywhere, take them bitches everywhere
Every time I look up see the same bitches everywhere
Bitch I come from DC, ask about us, we ain’t scary here
Take them pistols everywhere, I got hitters everywhere

[Verse 2]
I’m in the back of the back, I’m moving through Hollywood
Remember way back in the slums like Bollywood
I take an L and get that shit right back, that’s on my hood
Me and all my niggas got straps, I wish you would
Two racks for my boss bitches, better not get it scuffed
Bitch you know I’m up, when you see me say wassup
I keep ‘em in a tuck, you should see my runner up
All my bitches bad and all my bitches got a butt
Come on with bands here, nigga we ain’t playin’ fair
I was really on the block, boy you couldn’t stand there
Came up with a plan yeah, turned up with my mans yeah
Watch how I go ham if they just give me a chance yeah

[Hook]
Nigga I be everywhere
You ain’t never there
Every time I look up see the same bitches everywhere
Can’t wait to get this money, I’m gon’ take my niggas everywhere
Take them pistols everywhere, I got hitters everywhere
I got bitches everywhere, take them bitches everywhere
Every time I look up see the same bitches everywhere
Bitch I come from DC, ask about us, we ain’t scary here
