Verse one

I'll be Boomin on these hoes
All you nigga's gotta go
I'll be fuckin all your hoes
Got her standing on her toes
Look how that ass go
She be striking a pose
She be wiping her nose
I'm with Amber she needs a Rose
In the meantime let's make a toast

For all the nigga's that's hating
Nigga's that's faking
Thinking I won't make it
Well this is our time
We gonna shine

I'm Martin Luther King
Coz I had a dream I'm gonna win
Putting the game 6 feet
No knees
Only  when I pray
Get paid

6 hoes laying in my bed
Why you mad?
They all tryna give me head
I be that pretty Mxtherfvcker
Always swagged out
Pretty Mxtherfvcker
Always maxed out
Pretty Mxtherfvcker
Never pass out
Come here honey
I know you  want the money
Money
Honey
You just a bunny
I want the money

Why you gassing dawg?
Why you gassing dawg?

Why you gassing dawg?

I'll be Boomin on these hoes
I'll be Boomin on these hoes
Boomin on these hoes
I'll be Boomin on these hoes

Sexy with no clothes
Boomin on these hoes
Sliding down that pole
I'm in love with them hoes
It's never time to go
12 till 12 she's doing it like a ghost

 
Fuckin and suckin' it
Fuckin and suckin' it
Fuckin and suckin' it

Fuckin and suckin' it
Fuckin and suckin' it
Fuckin and suckin' it

I'll be boomin on the hoes
Fuckin and suckin' it
Fuckin and suckin' and Boomin
Fuckin and suckin' suckin'
Fuckin and suckin'
These nigga's
These nigga's
Be suckin and fuckin em b*tches
Fuckin' and suckin' em b*tches
This is for You Nigga
