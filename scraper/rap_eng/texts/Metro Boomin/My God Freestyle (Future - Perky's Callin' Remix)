Verse 1

Hard work ’til I flatline
Throw the Rollie, that’s passtime
Cam newton, my fans loose
Couple ladies, they dab fine
My raps for the people spirit, talk loud like Farrakhan
99, ain’t 100 yet, gotta go hard for that stat line
Need play cheddar no Mayweather
Rolls Royce w/ the gray leather
Pedigree been risin’ lately
Tripled up that 8th letter
Yo girl all on my jock now
Switched up ‘cause I taste better
Play Hostess, on the ride over
Role switch (rolls swiss), I hate lettuce
Keanu with the flips
I swear I’m not no crip
But that water color my mind frame
Picasso wit’ the prints
Them haters show they canines
I feel like Michael Vick
One commandment, shall
Not give a fuck, my bible lit

Oh my god (3x)

Verse 2

I just got off a vacation
Women poppin’, my brain racin’
I been lookin’ for a queen lately
Ain’t found her yet, i remain patient
Couple things more important tho
Crash Bandicoot Playstation
Gettin’ paid for my words homie
Rushin’ at me, no play fakin’
Triple option, s/o to college
Mind got a lotta mileage
Move audio dope ’til
I need a Brinks truck to transport my wallet
Ooh, fly as fuck no pilot
Ooh, jumper wet no Wallace
Ooh, they tryna abolish rhymers
Resorted to violence, you
Know listenin’ pays
Been dominatin’ this life so my Christian is Greyed
I’m tryna surf in that crowd ‘fore my vision decays
Nah I ain’t cooking’ that white up but my wrist entertains
Ancestors rippin’ the chains
And i am the gift of the slave
Flyin’ I lift off the page
Thoughts on visual planes
Spectrum effective, my lessons
Borne from obsession, confess this
Mission accomplished when I see
God in my section I need it
Break holy bread, I’ll eat it
Servin’ my ego, I feed it rappers
Y’all ain’t gon’ see me after
I ascend to the throne, no do not let ‘em in
Run that Monopoly, my ambition don’t never end
Cipher wit’ Jesus, he said my flow low-key heaven-sent

This the motherfuckin’ anthem
Lord
