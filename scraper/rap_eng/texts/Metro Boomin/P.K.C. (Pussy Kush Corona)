[Hook: Ryder Luna Luchini] x2

All these liquors bottles
All these local models
All these IG models
All these bitches on us

I been on this brown
Pussy kush corona
Pussy kush corona
Pussy kush corona

[Verse 1: Ryder Luna Luchini]

Run in his pockets I'm grimey
No I'm not thug but sliming
Gimme the power fuck diamonds
These bitches they like how I'm rhyming
These niggas they bite how I'm rhyming
I'm tweaking I'm living my life
I'm young and I'm getting it right
Put xans in my canister sprite

I handle my shit like a Hindu
You know what I'm tryna get into
I handle my shit like I'm meant to
Fuck on some thotties then pass 'em like takis
She going down under, no blimey
You know where to find me
My city so villainous nigga
I chill with some villainous niggas
Don't dabble or deal with you niggas
You know where to find me

I'm real with these niggas
I keep it Pharell with these niggas
Lil bitch ho I'm grinding
I'm dumping them clips like an iMax
I'm fucking your bitch til she climax
My side chick she come from an island
She whip it like pyrex
And she got that booty like pirates
The kush got me seeing in high res
Can't look at no reggie I'm blinded

Pockets got c-notes I'm sanging
Bands her dance Usher Ramon
Fuck Lassie
Let her drown
Ain't no bitch that I'm saving (thats Luna)


Thats legit
I will rep my city and you know thats a given
Nashville where the riders ride and there ain't no civilians
Fuck the world up juug a nigga then we strip em, Brazilian
And I'm gon get this shit just like I said how imma get it

You wasn't aware?
Nigga thats cool I don't care
Don't wonder how I got in here
My time is now the appointment is clear
I came to kill it for bants and some cheers
And thats real...
...And thats real
