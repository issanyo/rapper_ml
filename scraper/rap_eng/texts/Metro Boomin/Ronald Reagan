[Intro: Matt Nolan]
Young Rich Republicans
You know, we never really had no old conservatism
We got a whole lotta new conservatism though
(If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot ya)
Hey!

[Chorus: Matt Nolan]
Rain drop, drop top
New Republican in the White House
Riddin' this country of the pot, pot, pot
"Just Say No" is our Republican thought
Lyndon B. Johnson created stagflation
Democrats were a bad representation
Call up Reagan he'll come and help you
I got reforms that are long overdue
My name is Ronald Reagan
I'm a Christian, not a pagan
My reforms are savage, ruthless
Reaganomics with tax cuts too
My name is Ronald Reagan
I'm a Christian, not a pagan
My reforms are savage, ruthless
Reaganomics with tax cuts too

[Verse 1: Matt Nolan]
Ronald, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!
Drug raids on drug raids
My girl Nancy on D.A.R.E
I'm floatin' all up on some air
To save you all with a prayer
God is my judge, fair
Time to be aware
Just follow me I swear
You all need me to come rescue you
All these bad things are not helping you
Don't stop or the devil keep jumping you
Give the children something to look to
Ayy, I do the most
Yeah, pull up, exposed
Yeah, start to beware
Of drugs with a program called D.A.R.E
Ron the ruler, it's cooler
No days off, Ferris Bueller
All this constitutional
Effect will be indisputable
Return to family values
Suck them back like a vacuum
Raising a family is harder
When the stacks of money are shorter
Tax cuts on tax cuts
Got more dough on more dough
Your money making your bank grow
Parenting costs will go low
You can all shop at Costco
Because with better financials
Families become more stable
All great change in our country
Begins at the dinner table (Ah)

[Chorus: Drew Nolan]
Rain drop, drop top
New Republican in the White House
Riddin' this country of the pot, pot, pot
"Just Say No" is our Republican thought

Call up Reagan he'll come and help you
I got reforms that are long overdue
My name is Ronald Reagan
I'm a Christian, not a pagan
My reforms are savage, ruthless
Reaganomics with tax cuts too
My name is Ronald Reagan
I'm a Christian, not a pagan
My reforms are savage, ruthless
Reaganomics with tax cuts too

[Verse 2: Drew Nolan]
'84 I'm re-elected, nobody objected
Look at the electoral map and you know I meet the quota
Landslide victory, won every state except Minnesota
Why I won is no mystery
The biggest win in our history
I'm always making new reforms
The biggest part of my platforms
Still be cooking up new reforms
Call me Reagan Ratatouille
Done this before, not a newbie
You shouldn't be smokin' those doobies
Reaganomics, I'm the coolest
I run the U.S.A. like Bob Cousy
I pull up, I pull up, I pull up
I set a good standard for all Eastern Europe
I'm workin', I'm workin', I'm workin'
Our financial success not 'cause of good luck
A new plan for defense
I told them put missiles in space, Star Wars, call me Vader
These missiles will blow up commies
And they launchin' from outer space, Space Invaders
Uh, yeah, dat way, reforms avoided a doomsday
Yeah, dat way, trickle down money the new way
Yeah, dat way, rich and poor get a good payday
Yeah, dat way, big tax cuts get us more money
Hey!

[Verse 3: Matt O'Brien]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Commies be bad to the bone
Wait, they goin' broke
I swear to God they'll need a loan
Yeah, USSR
They do what we don't extol
Ending d√©tente is our goal
So we can exert more control
Ooh, ooh, picked to take over from Carter
To make pressure on Soviets harder
Tellin' terror that we do not barter
Wait, what about Flight 847?
We needed to save from oppression
To counter Hezbollah aggression
Yeah, reducing our arms with Mikhail
Preservin' our country is vital
Now democracy used by our rivals
'Cause we spreadin' it like it's viral
Tear down this wall, yeah
End the Cold War in a minute
Confident that we gon' win it
'Cause with freedom we're committed
Ayy, my name is Ronald Reagan
Tough leader since I came in
From acting to active campaignin'
All-American, Gipper, I'm famous
Cristiano was named after greatness
No president more courageous
From Eureka, I made a pangaea of freedom
I realized I knew that I'd make it
Yeah!
