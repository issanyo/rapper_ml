Claim to fuck shit up just like ISIS, the nicest
Sick like I got every type of itis, I might just
Run into your city for the night just to light shit
Up and burn it down, I'm on some hype shit just like this
Who you think you are, you can't spar with a broken sword
I go forth and I open doors, get on tours and remain the source
Of all this talking on the internet
Cause bitch I been a threat
Here across the globe they inspired by all my interlect
The illest vet
Doing this for 10 years, I'm 20 now
Moving to the west when I turn 21 to run it down
They can't tell me nothing bout nothing, I run this fucking sound
I don't think I sound like nobody so bitch I wonder how
My name gets fucked up so much, it's like a roll call
Coming to your city to settle shit with my roll dawg
All you rappers act cos I swear that shit is so flawed
Was speaking to my boss through the wire but I ain't hold on
So rest in peace dude
I mean, it's dressed as D2
They never let you lead to
But I have yet to see you
Damn, cos all know is when it's my time then I'm finna to go
Living my life without getting too low, I been doing it all but not doing the most
Yeah, ride my wave and get cap-sized
Showing up in all black-ties
New age rap it all acts-wise
But ain't nobody fucking with me so that's fine
On my Ric Flair shit, I go (woo) on a bitch
I don't see nobody else making moves like I did
Just like Pablo when he's picking all the moves with the bricks
I just do the music, I let you make the flip
Oh god, how are ya'll still fucking here though?
All these new rappers are weirdos
Yeah, you can pull a gun on me
It's the person that's behind that'll fear though

[Yeah I was gon' stop it right here but I got one more though, fuck it]

Umm
Now I can break through
I murder the music, getting the views, and not to mistake you
I let it confuse, then outta me too so now I'ma make moves
I'm getting them tunes, whatever you do's, I never will make room
Cos I'm coming and chopping them up
Killing them now and then propping them up
I got em looking like Izzy Dapata, getting them gains but not of them because
I am not a human, it's clearly because it's skill is godly
Go prepare your posse to stop it, you'd have to cause a homi-
