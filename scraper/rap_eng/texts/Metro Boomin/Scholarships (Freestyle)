[Chorus: Baseman]
I'm in a fast car with a bitch right beside me
Something under my seat I pray to God they don't try me
I fell in love with this money
I fell in love with the Roley
Bitches keep calling my phone
I said fuck all of these hoes (lard)

[Verse 1]
You know we stay 'bout it not into frontin'
If I didn't get him my niggas got him
Plug came from Russia we copped the Russian
Plug came from Russia we copped the Russian
Came here to vibe I don't want no beef
Niggas act up we disturb the peace
Hatin' on me you can suck a dick
Dishin' out sweets you can Pick n Mix
Talking 'bout colours, then mine's blue
Shoot at your whip we don't like you
Half of these bitches they love me
The other half they just tried to
My women stay fleeky I fuck with Barbies
She call me up when she wanna party
I give her the D when she's feeling naughty
But I'd rather starve I don't eat the narny

[Chorus: Baseman]
I'm in a fast car with a bitch right beside me
Something under my seat I pray to God they don't try me
I fell in love with this money
I fell in love with the Roley
Bitches keep calling my phone
I said fuck all of these hoes (lard)

[Verse 2]
I'm somewhere I wanna be
All of my niggas we in the streets
I'm where I wanna be
All of my niggas we in the streets
Lately I'm suffering, weed and codeine be my medicine
I'm waving out of control
Half of these rappers aren't levelling
Feds coming to my house, hotty laying on my couch
I just put it in her mouth
'Cos really, I don't care 'bout these hoes
Really I swear I shared all my hoes
I tell her bend it over touch her toes
I don't play truth or dare with these hoes
I won't shed a tear for these hoes
They never wanted me when I was low
Tell 'em next year I'm coming the game
My niggas we ain't changed, we ain't changed (no)

[Chorus: Baseman]
I'm in a fast car with a bitch right beside me
Something under my seat I pray to God they don't try me
I fell in love with this money
I fell in love with the Roley
Bitches keep calling my phone
I said fuck all of these hoes (lard)
