[Intro: Young Thug]
Metro Boomin' want some more nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
Metro Boomin said he got me, yeah
All these rappers try to copy, yeah
Stick to ice, don't play no hockey, yeah
My strap is black and hot like coffee, yeah
I'm goin' fast, you can't stop me, yeah
Heard your album, break weed on a copy, yeah
I used to want her, now she sloppy, yeah
Compare 'em to me, they can't top me, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'ma put the money up for broski's bail, yeah
I just spent $200 on my nails, yeah
You wasn't there and now I'm outta here, yeah
You call my phone, I ignore and I don't care, yeah
You say you goin' broke and I don't care
Got 10 Gucci shoes, I flex on you and buy another pair
When I had no hope you wasn't there
So when you ask for help, no I don't care

[Verse 1]
You say you can't pay your bills, no I don't care
I'ma go and spend your rent on underwear
I'm in Saks Fifth, used to shop at Sears
I've been poppin' pills and poppin' seals
I removed the fakes and shit got real
My shooter got tech fleece on
He don't train, but he trained to kill
Remember when Cash hit me up on the phone, I was broke as hell
'Member when I used to wake up, I ain't wanna check the mail
I know some bitches whorin' but I won't kiss and tell
The same bitches that put Body in a cell
All we knew is rob and steal and sell
I'm eatin' cajun salmon, used to eat Taco Bell

[Pre-Chorus]
Metro Boomin said he got me, yeah
All these rappers try to copy, yeah
Stick to ice, don't play no hockey, yeah
My strap is black and hot like coffee, yeah
I'm goin' fast, you can't stop me, yeah
Heard your album, break weed on a copy, yeah
I used to want her, now she sloppy, yeah
Compare 'em to me, they can't top me, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'ma put the money up for broski's bail, yeah
I just spent $200 on my nails, yeah
You wasn't there and now I'm outta here, yeah
You call my phone, I ignore and I don't care, yeah
You say you goin' broke and I don't care
Got 10 Gucci shoes, I flex on you and buy another pair
When I had no hope you wasn't there
So when you ask for help, no I don't care

[Verse 2]
You ain't drinkin' real Act, I can tell by the smell
Your girl just text me, said she hope I've been doin' well
They was cold, but now when they see me all these bitches melt
I'm a wizard, my dick game got her under a spell
I pop some molly, I just might go and shoot at myself
Frost just passed it to me, I put it under my belt
Still hide the work behind my hats on top of the shelf
Used to hide from my mom smokin' blunts in the back of the house
Why would I give you a half? I'll take it myself
You be the type to pop pills and go sit on the couch
I heard that your man is a rat and your OG's a mouse
You think I fucked on your bitch, I just nutted in her mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
Metro Boomin said he got me, yeah
All these rappers try to copy, yeah
Stick to ice, don't play no hockey, yeah
My strap is black and hot like coffee, yeah
I'm goin' fast, you can't stop me, yeah
Heard your album, break weed on a copy, yeah
I used to want her, now she sloppy, yeah
Compare 'em to me, they can't top me, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'ma put the money up for broski's bail, yeah
I just spent $200 on my nails, yeah
You wasn't there and now I'm outta here, yeah
You call my phone, I ignore and I don't care, yeah
You say you goin' broke and I don't care
Got 10 Gucci shoes, I flex on you and buy another pair
When I had no hope you wasn't there
So when you ask for help, no I don't care
