Verse 1;Jaisenzz
Keep on thinking of the time that you lost
Recording after my album just dropped
I mean what else could you have taught
After all of the things I bought
Remixing too many songs
Realizing that I'm not wrong
Learned that when there's not a MJ there is a Lebron
Think about it until next time there is no bond
I was listening to Khaled when woke up in the morning
In his pool there is probably need for more storage
I ain't like Migos after they say a line they say another thing
All of those times I don't care I feel they really think
Probably bumped there heads on the side of a mink

Hook
Said I was coming back you didn't listen
I was in the hospital while you were dissing
I keep hearing that bomb that keeps ticking
You underestimate me you will be thinking
Why did I do this I should have been lip syncing
It's easier to do that when nobody is singing
Now until next time
You will never find mine
Calvin Harris and DJ Khaled going through the Slide
The one song I knew from Migos was Fight Night
Now until next time
You will never find mine
Calvin Harris and DJ Khaled going through the Slide
The one song I knew from Migos was Fight Night

Verse 2;JZZ
Metro saying that there is No Complaints
Offset and Drake were in the studio about to faint
EarDrumers backwards taught us the word Swang
And now I'm wondering who do I thank
See you look you be throwing all of these disses
About some simple little kisses
Hey she did it because he the one person she misses
Now I need you listen
You are as strong as a kitten
Not talking about Pok√©mon Litten
Migos you would think they would be chillin
But they get jealous I be making a million
I'm going a little off topic
Who the hell you been watching
You are as weird as a goblin
After what I've seen who should I be stoppin
This song going through mainstream
Drake shooting out the Champagne beam
Boy the Migos actually think they better than me
I thought Thug said a lot of y'all you should be feeling
Instead of robbing and stealing
I saw you in jail I was teasing
I saw you diss me for some weird things
I was wondering really?

Verse 3
I actually don't lip sync
You are as tall as Yao Ming
But you ain't as sharp as my bling
Thinking of Busta Rhymes
It's been a long year and I'm still paying dimes
Told ZoneMaker it looked like he wanted to cry
3 verses like the ending of family
I told y'all I drive in a Camry
Lately you have been inpatient for the taste of lime
I told you the next song was going to be Until Next Time

Hook
Said I was coming back you didn't listen
I was in the hospital while you were dissing
I keep hearing that bomb that keeps ticking
You underestimate me you will be thinking
Why did I do this I should have been lip syncing
It's easier to do that when nobody is singing
Now until next time
You will never find mine
Calvin Harris and DJ Khaled going through the Slide
The one song I knew from Migos was Fight Night
Now until next time you will never find mine
Calvin Harris and DJ Khaled going through the Slide
The one song I knew from Migos was Fight Night
