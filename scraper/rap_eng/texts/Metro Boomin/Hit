[Intro]
Live shit
It's OLN
You already know niggas can't fuck with the gang
Gang shit
They ain't ready for this shit man
It's bye fucking season
Buy some fucking drugs or fucking bye
Fucking fuck the gang or bye

[Hook: MK]
Sleeping in cars, now we living in some condos
A ten on his neck, call nine on me no rondo
We cutting your grass, but we ain't mowing no lawn tho
Two guns on our waist, but you can't call us James Bondo
We run up a cheque, we flex and finesse
You broke you a pess, two bands worth the rest
Got a glizzy no tec, got a vest still get wet
Going live on your set, it's OLN fuck the rest

[Verse 1: Smiley]
I used to sleep in dirty traps, now i got a condo
I even sleep good now, my dawg had three condos
I cannot slip now, i have two rondos
I was in 11 division, and they were playing rondo
They were playing 9 on me, they wanted me to snitch
Their asking about cancer
Their asking about pezze
Their asking about nice
I don't know those guys
I was telling them lies
They wanted the guys
My plug so lowkey, changes his number every week
Like if you ain't got money, then we cannot speak
MK so live, he lets niggas leak
Like where these niggas, their playing hide-n-go seek

[Verse 2: Ryda]
Your bitch yeah she know i'm the man
Getting in and out the six with my man
Tryna find a way out the land
With my pockets filled up with a band
Couple guys spent out with my fan
So we can be done breaking up the gram
Tryna make it any way i can
Me and MK kick in doors for the band
Heard you got it we coming in fast
Gon' be lacking get slapped for the band
See the forty put you in the trash
Make you dance cause you scared to get slapped
Yeah, make you dance cause you scared to get slapped, yeah

[Verse 3: Homie]
They didn't listen to me, i did it all by myself
Never had my hand out, this nigga never needed help
Diamonds dancing Michael Jackson
I've been trapping no relaxing
Trapping 'til we in a mansion
Nine on me no dancing
Please do not lack
We do not allow shit we attack
Going OT and back, spent a couple months in the trap
Twenty eight moved in a day, they ain't trapping they some lames
Them niggas broke they don't save, hunneds all up in my face
