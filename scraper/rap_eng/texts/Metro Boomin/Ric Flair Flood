See him out talking 'bout my only hit a fluke
Acting like he never ever seen the morning news
Bringing nothing to the table, really get a booth, get the boot
Smoke a lot of loud, lot of weed, catch a case
Got it for the smell, I can't afford to hesitate

Like finna take a L, got ya feelings on a plate, fake
Put my mind on it then I put some fire on it
