[Hook]
Pistol in my coup, can't fit in my shoe
Money in garage, can't fit in my room
Ten hoes in my bed, can't fit in my pool
Niggas in my crib, can't fit in my zoo
You ain't shooting pistols, I can't rock with you
Money on my mental, I can't talk to you
I'm Glo Gang, I can't talk for you
I'm my own man, I can't walk for you

[Verse]
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
Lotta choppers for this war, nigga
Lotta vans for the drive-by, nigga
Make my gun sing a song;
You'll get chorus, nigga
Eight shots, comin' for ya, nigga
Don't stand here, move forward, nigga
Some of my guns just got deported, nigga
But I know he gon' get it
Like a phone, we fuck with pictures
Told the police;
Don't make me call my lawer, nigga
I told homie, don't make me drop my .40, nigga
I Glo-up up, bitch I'm in my Glory, nigga
And if you see me, you know I ain't worried, nigga

[Hook]
Pistol in my coup, can't fit in my shoe
Money in garage, can't fit in my room
Ten hoes in my bed, can't fit in my pool
Niggas in my crib, can't fit in my zoo
You ain't shooting pistols, I can't rock with you
Money on my mental, I can't talk to you
I'm Glo Gang, I can't talk for you
I'm my own man, I can't walk for you
