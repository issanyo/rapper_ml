My girl pull up with an attitude
She ain't really mad.... She just got an attitude
Sht cute, so you know I gotta put her in a better mood
When we burn out like candles
Forget the Malibu & the goose
She be in the kitchen really cooking, in the morning
With the eggs & the jelly with the cream cheese, bagels
Good lord, she a queen... Say my Thank You'd
What you going on about babe?
Oh, you wana be a model?
Oh, you wana run a bakery?
Oh, you could see yourself acting?
Well go ahead, Cest La Vie
Yeah, that's life
Don't let nobody hate
Ima be the last one
I know what it ain't
You know what it is
What it was when you met me
You know I gotta be an artist... Etsy
Sht, anyways... First off, boom... We get these headshots right
Then you get up with an agent
That'll rep for the talent that you got for the pages
Look, now you got a resume...
Now you got a way to get ya foot up in the door
Get a loan with a bank, then levitate
Ima start scouting locations...
For ya Cupcake Shake Bakery
That sht sound good as hell
That name is copyrighted as of now
Soon as you hear it, know where its held
Now back to it. Back to you
Let's get this building permit
Few racks down to get that owned
Let them confirm it
