[Hook: Yo Gotti]
I just threw a Fed out of Magic
I just had a hoe sign for a package
Quarter mil in the mattress
That's a 30 hanging out that ratchet
I just fucked your re-up off at Onyx
A 30, that ain't nothing, I'm being honest
Trap jumping like it's Sonic
And I'm in the Phantom cause I own it

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I've been in the trap house all night
Got me counting money all morning
Niggas rest up and I'm yawnin'
I may fall asleep in this foreign
She jumped in this Phantom with no drawers on
Baby daddy wanna put them paws on me
But he a sucker and he know it
He fuck around and tried to put the laws on me
I've been getting money for a long time
Bitch, I'm on these pills, this the wrong time (xans)
I just threw a ten out in Folley's
I just gave two stripper bitches Molly
In the condo, in the condo
Units in the kitchen, choppers at the front door
54th floor, looking down at the city
Rich nigga, fucked your bitch on a ticket, let's get it

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
I just threw a Fed out of Magic

Trap jumping like it's Sonic
And I'm in the Phantom cause I own it

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I got a lot of money, ask them lil' heads
But if you was a threat, you would have been dead
But I be with the shits, you niggas been scared
Don't come to me with all that he said she said
I just bought the [?] with no stones in it
I like all my houses with no phones in it
I like all my bitches to have problems
So I can be the one to solve them (I am)
Fuck your nigga, baby, yeah fuck him
Once you get right, we gonna pull up on him
Show him what he missing, then we laugh at him
Treat him like a stripper, throw a bag at him
Yeah, pick them dollars up, pick them dollars up
You ain't got no money, but a million followers
Heard them pussy niggas talking like they shot at us
On the low, niggas always trying to holler at us (they do)

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
And it got curtains, and it got curtains
Told baby girl put that 40 in her purse
It's a Chanel bag, and you know they ain't gonna search you
You ever say a word about my business, I'mma hurt you, bitch
