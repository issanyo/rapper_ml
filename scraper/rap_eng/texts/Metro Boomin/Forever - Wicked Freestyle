[Intro: Forever]
Yeah, Yeah
Forever, Forever, lamarina


[Hook: Forever}
Wicked, Wicked I'm addicted all I do is cash out
Wicked, Wicked I'm addicted all I do is cash out
I'mma stack up till the summer then I'mma blow these racks out


[Verse 1: Forever]

Mack daddy Mike Jackson on the dance floor
Billy Jean I know these hoes ain't really loyal
Wicked tune got speakers burning like it's coil
I rap around heat the crowd up tenfoil
I'm switching lanes, switching lanes no driver
Now these fugazees bite my style Mike Tyson
I drive foreign fly foreign call it horizon
Dabbin through these checks grinding till I see three hyphens
Young nigga from ontario in the 6-1, 3
Southside nigga lion hearted I'm a Titan
Circle small I only ride wit real breadrans
2016 what a time to be alive, yea
Diamonds drippin wicked hotter than the suns heat
I grind till my whole fam & my team eat
I grind till my whole fam & my team eat
Said it twice incase you missed it on the repeat
Back to back like I'm Jordan on the repeat
Back to back to back like I'm on a three-peat
Primetime primetiming on these rookies
If you ain't talking money you gotta go I'm sorry
Haters hate but all that is to me is comedy
All these haters now be turnin' to some fans of me
Walkin down the street with that Khaled key, (''DJ khaled: Don't ever play yourself'')
Never knew that my struggle would turn to energy


[Hook: Forever]
Wicked, Wicked I'm addicted all I do is cash out
Wicked, Wicked I'm addicted all I do is cash out
I'mma stack up untill the summer then I'mma blow these racks out


[Verse 2/Bridge: Forever]
These Fugazees they hating
I swear man these haters they hating
I get it I get it I get it it's a hate it or love it but remember it's yourself that your playing
Young nigga I'm just aiming the riches
Young nigga I be living so dangerous
I risk it I risk it I risk it I risk it you only live once so I'm glad that I do it


[Outro: Forever]
Wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Lamarina, forever
