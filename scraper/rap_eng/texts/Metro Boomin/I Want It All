[Verse 1: Jose Guapo]
You ever dreamed about something then woke up and went got it?
From an old school Chevy to a foreign big body
Nigga look at my closet, that's a whole lotta tags
We don't look at no prices, niggas never be counting
I don't need no accountant, I count this shit by myself
I'ma keep on drinking lean but I know it's bad for my health
I'ma skeet on my belt, I'ma up on my wealth
And when she let me in that pussy I'ma go Michael Phelps
We just some young wild niggas from the projects
And you can google me, bitch I'm worth a big check

Gang, gang, gang, gang
Half a million in my furniture
Gang, gang, bang, bang, bang
Get out of line and I point at ya
Me and my niggas rep the same gang
Haters still live under ya
Used to be broke, I got my money up
If your niggas fall, help your homie up
I got a Mac-11, Mac in my tummy tucked

Ain't want no war with us

Got racks in my attic yeah
