[Intro: Yung Rudd]
Rudder
We ain't got no old ganja
We got a whole lot of new ganja though
Ha

[Chorus: Yung Rudd]
Hear the real scene
Trinbago - nobody near we
All of we gyal them, they real sweet
If I GT, then it's real beat
Took rap from nothing to something bredda
That's why we stay hotter than the weather
Allyuh men wack and I'm friggin fed up
Do not care 'bout nothing but the cheddar

We gyal them bess nuh stush
Whether from 'Moorings or bush
My bredrins is savage pushers
They does give me the colly & kush
We gyal them bess nuh stush
Whether from 'Moorings or bush
My bredrins is savage pushers
They does give me the colly & kush

[Verse 1: Yung Rudd]
Young Paxx
Woo woo woo woo woo!
Hits upon hits
I get lit up on spliffs
And then go write a song with my crew
I take your gyal away from you
Dan, I'z a dog... ROOF
She swallow all JUICE
You niggas all TOOTS
I've been trying to up my swag dawg
Singing more on the lowkey
Got a wifey in the bag dawg
And she pretty, no Maloney
Allyuh bestie does be Stag dawg
Friendsing up beers like Mowgli
This is why we are not croneys
'Cause you are the shit emoji
Futurist mind, so I go be bess when I old
Like Rowley wife
Trini rappers live that Murray life
You're acting like hoes, you love the vice
Surrounded by allyuh? I must be blight
'Cause you lame, Trini rap money tight
Men want to know how I win:
I stay wiser 'cause of the bud he light
Woo! Get it? AH!
Set it off
Shelling bars
Men take swipes like debit cards
But I bring heat like menopause
Woo
Again there them bars, yeah
Even more so than the avenue
All Trinis love me like callaloo
That's why I needles and manners you
And get the jammets too


[Chorus: Yung Rudd]


[Verse 2: Yung Rudd]
Beat the rest like plenty pan
'Cause they wotless... Kes the Band
Introduce me to your gyal as wifey
When she very bad
Tell she go and work out, belly bang
She take plenty man
Mine like village, nuh Mush
Yeah, she bess nuh stush
All of my niggas is pushers
Cannabis green and it lush
I give up the meat, I on the plants
Call me Paxx Baba Ganoush
Smoke the tree I get the munchies
I could rope gyal in, like Bunji
Watch Rudder pull down she undies
Say she wa' spread it out like it's sunscreen
You're supposed to know
That the coldest flow
Talking polar snow
Is supposed to go
To the bro who rolls
And smokes the dope
On the coast with toes
Inna the water just soaking no
Other MC spitting as gross the GOAT is me
That's really real, I follow the code
No Overdose
WOO!
Looked in the mirror saw the
TRUTH
The illest nigga spitting in the
BOOTH
Dan your gyal be like a toddler
TOOTH
When it going and drop out, yeah she
LOOSE


[Chorus: Yung Rudd]


[Verse 3: Inzey]
Ya ya
It's Inzey & Rudd again
Running the island like Gilligan
Making a killing kids
Alien like Krillin kids...
We ball with your wishes nigga
Yeah we on God Level
Y'all can't touch me 'cause I got levels
You see these watches man I got bezels
Man I owed the bank and then it got settled
So I'm balling nigga talking falsetto
Got the flow from the faucet up
Illest nigga even the far sit up
Man they know my team, it's like they Arsenal
They see the cars and then the doors sit up
All my bitches be tossing up
Your shoes, they don't even cost enough
Awesome's us
Ha
Inzey


[Chorus: Yung Rudd]
