[Intro]
When you come back in here, we gon' be like, ayy!
Trust me, bitch, trust me

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Hypnotize me with that motion
Girl, you might even provoke me
To spend, spend all I've got
I can get it back real quick
Give you an experience
Like you've never had before
Dream catch you in your thought, yeah
How'd you get so fine? (Ayy)
I can make you go night, night
I can make you go night, night
You be down for whatever
When I pour it up, I don't measure (Hey)
Say you love me five-ever
Our love was sudden
Make this bitch jump like a step team
See my diamonds, can you say, "Wet dream"?
First, let me close the bamboo blinds
She don't say my name but she gotta scream it

[Refrain: Swae Lee]
Dancin' in the strobe lights
With your eyes on me
I don't need to know your sign
Do you see somethin' you like?

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I know what you're into
I know what you're into
I know what you're into

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Hey, yeah!
I can't take your call, I need face time
Rode the metro, took the bassline
Took all the good stuff, now it ain't mine (Hey)
You've been gone for forever
How much I miss your love, I can't measure (No)
Know you got another special
But just for this night, go up a level (Hey)
When we pop outside, let you take lead (Lead)
She just treat the dick like a jetski (Skeet, skeet)
I was posted up like a set piece (Piece)
Where you get these from? I can't take these (Down, yeah)
I'm the one, number one
I've done finally found my home between the moon and the sun
Every time we come around, just know it move and it run
Man it's crazy, all my youngins gotta move with a gun
Drop it down, drop it down, way you do it
Know you come from out of town
I've been stuck off in my ways, I've been workin' on it
On some on my own time, don't be waitin' on me
I've been zoned out in the days, it's an air burst
I've been livin' through a maze on my Fred Durst
Get that shit from out my way, make the mess worse
To the A.M., I make my rounds
Not a peep, don't hear a sound
Now you know if you ain't know it, now you know

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Travis Scott]
Wonder what you're into
I know what you're into
I know what you're into
Into, I know what you're into
I know what you're into
I know what you're into
Into, I know what you're into
I know what you're into
I know what you're into (Hey)

[Refrain: Swae Lee]
Dancin' in the strobe lights
With your eyes on me
I don't need to know your sign
Do you see somethin' you like?

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I know what you're into
I know what you're into
I know what you're into
