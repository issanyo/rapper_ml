Lyrics From Snippet

[Chorus: Rich The Kid & Gucci Mane]
...
They ain't fuckin' with Rich and the Wop (what)
Told her I want the tippity-top (huh)
For the summer I'm coppin' the drop (skrr)
Gettin' to the check, can't stop (yeah)
Too much drip, please don't slip, bitch, I'm ballin' (ballin', bitch, I'm ballin')
I might count another milli in the mornin' (milli, cookie)

[Verse: Gucci Mane]
Huh, so many wardrobes, I don't wear the same clothes
...

[Chorus: Rich The Kid & Gucci Mane]
...
They ain't fuckin' with Rich and the Wop (what)
Told her I want the tippity-top (huh)
For the summer I'm coppin' the drop (skrr)
Gettin' to the check, can't stop (yeah)
Too much drip, please don't slip, bitch, I'm ballin' (ballin', bitch, I'm ballin')
I might count another milli in the mornin' (milli, cookie)
