[Intro: Zombii]
You know, young rich creepas
You know so we never really had no old diamonds
We got a whole lotta new diamonds tho, hah
(If Young Mojang don't trust you I'm gon' mine ya)
Hey!

[Chorus: Zombii]
Mine stop, get crop (sand drop)
Eatin more gapples than a porkchop (gapples)
Slayin on your witch she a ugly (girl)
Smeltin’ up gold with a furnace (smelt)
We came from nothin' to dimons creepa (hey)
