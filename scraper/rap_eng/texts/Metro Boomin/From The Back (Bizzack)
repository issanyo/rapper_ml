[Hook]
I hit your ho straight from the bizzack
Young Thugger Thugger came at your neck
Guapo my nigga, he get rinnacks
Fuck niggas stealin' swag, boy, bring back
Booling in the lobby with cousin Buzz
I'm a young pimp, where the fuck is my mug?
Plus I'm redder than the hollywood rug
Every time I roll up it's granny's buds

[Verse 1]
Thugger, Thugger, tatted like fuckin' vatos
These fuck niggas county done craze them tacos
I got weight if you in need of colossal
MPA done came with us, cop 'em
He tried to front me all them bricks and bills
If I had spots, I would've been in jail
I don't look like Lil Jon, but I'll scream and yell
I drop them bands on, I'ma design her specs
I catch your girl and she have the finest sex
She a stoner, she cut her molly with her X
She was like "what I gotta to fuck your dawg?" I'm like "fetch"

[Hook]
I hit your ho straight from the bizzack
Young Thugger Thugger came at your neck
Guapo my nigga, he get rinnacks
Fuck niggas stealin' swag, boy, bring back
Boolin' in the lobby with cousin Buzz
I'm a young pimp, where the fuck is my mug?
Plus I'm redder than the hollywood rug
Every time I roll up it's granny's buds

[Verse 2]
She wanna meet me at that water
She want Young Thug to take that water
You know I'ma take the water
You know I'ma drank the water
Now you can't catch me in no magazine
But I'm ridin' round with the prom queen
Young Thug crooked, he need alignment
I hide that dick, she gon' go and find it
I had a couple play lined up for her
Ain't talkin' cars, but I bought her Tom Ford
She say "how I look?" and I replied "gorgeous"
If I weren't rappin' I'd be locked up for forgery

[Hook]
