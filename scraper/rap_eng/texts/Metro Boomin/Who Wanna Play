[Chorus:] (x2)
Hunnid band jewel, now who wanna play
Fifty shots in the K, now who wanna play
We could take it outside if you wanna play
Got some niggas down to die, now who wanna play
Who wanna play, who wanna play, who wanna play
Who wanna play, who wanna play, who wanna play

[Verse 1:]
You wanna play, then let the games begin
Fuck it, I just had to catch a case again
2 clips together and they duck taped
Knock the ice off a nigga cupcake
Look so long I could use it as a pave way
Way you workin' with them hunnid rounds
You don't need a thang

[Chrous:] (x2)
