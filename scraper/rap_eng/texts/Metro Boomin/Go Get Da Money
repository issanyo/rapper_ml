Young Guapo will slaughter your daughter
All the bitches wanna spoil her but
They know they cannot afford her
They say I been on the scale
You want them packs and the bales

We cop the pack when it fills
Go put some more ice on my ears
Then add some ice on my wrist

And cutta a tutta a cutta a tutta a cutta tatta yeah

They treating me like i'm a star
Just like to high as a star

Shit when you get money you loose all your [?]
I go on sprint to wreak an go shoot
Stop telling us a lie and tell us the truth

Put money in the machine I'm counting the cheddar
More money I get it's just making me better
More money you get it's just making you fake
Sipping that purp, that yella that lick
Get us a load and we have enough paper
