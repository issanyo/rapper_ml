[Intro]
You know, This just some real nigga shit, a real nigga story
You know what I'm saying?

[Hook]
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in the new 'rarri
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billy Jean

[Verse 1: Syko Solja]
I had a bitch hit my phone say she rolling up some weed
Another on the way that say she pouring up some lean
I hope they come together like a muh' fucking seem
Said I hope they cum together like they fucking in a scene
Ima muh' fucking G, you niggas never thought about it
You tryna' be like me? You niggas just some carbon copies
You say you in the streets? Word mane, with your heart?
You wouldn't touch a key, if your first name was Mozart
Yeah, so pussy nigga stop lying
The only time you on a site is pussy nigga dot com
You pussy niggas not sly, so stop with all that hate sport
Or the next time I'm with Wayne bored, I'll knock you out with his skateboard, hanh!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Future]
Whipping up a cake, just to go and snatch a spider
Young nigga play with keys, like a type writer
Al Capone, John Gotti was a nigga idol
I was never snitching, I can put it on the Bible
In a 4 door beamer, driving with a rifle
Nigga where you at, nigga we go pull up on ya
Young Bitch looking like Janet in the 80's
We was grinding up from a tube and a baby
Got the girl dripping wet like a jerry curl
Got a styrofoam cup and its full of syrup
Send it over from New Mexico & Let me Work
I can get 36 for a clean shirt

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Pop a lot of pain pills
'Bout to put rims on my skateboard wheels
Yeah, beat that pussy up like Emmett Till
Yeah
2 cellphones ringing at the same time
That's your ho, call her from 2 different phones
Tell that bitch we need to fuck alone
See you fuck her wrong, & I fuck her long
I got a love/hate relationship with Molly
I rather pop a ollie, & my dick is a Trolley
Boy I bury you like Halle, & these hoes say I'm blind
Cause I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump & grind
& I just received a package, them other niggas taxing
Man my pockets so fat, I'm starting to feel contractions
And my cousin went to jail for some chickens
& he already home man that nigga must be snitching
Cut him off like Karate

[Hook]
