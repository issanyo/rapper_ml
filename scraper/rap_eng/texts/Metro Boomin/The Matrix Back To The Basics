[Verse 2: Future]
Soon as I jumped off the porch I was in it
I had to get me a Porsche without no limit
Sell dope for polo sports stop by in Benzes
You got a lick on the first without attention
This dirty society made me a menace
These young niggas riding on ya they so relentless
I conquer any and everything that I wanted
You see That Chopper on my lap its Fully Loaded
Ain't trying to hurt ya I'll merc ya I'm playing defense
These pussy niggas they trying to give me a reason
You can't be talking to niggas turned co-defendants
We ain't gone stop we on top and we gone keep winning
