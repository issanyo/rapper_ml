[Chorus]
Do a hundred all the way to the bank
I'm taking hundreds out the bank
Just bought a new car, I'ma change the paint
Big body Mulsanne, switching lanes
Two stacks just for the frame
I spent a fifty on my chain
I put the picture in the frame
I'ma roll up in the rain

[Verse 1]
Now we back to back Mulsannes
Get rolled up for that new Chanel
Walk in Neimans, I need new smells
And I'm stackin' these whips, I need new L's
Every day a different girl, I ain't got no chill
It's a fast car but it got big wheels
You shouldn't be getting up off them pills
I'm smoking gas, I'm off the tip, tip
We got more guns than T.I.P (T.I)
I walk in the club, I'm gettin' strips
At [?], waiting on ribs
Niggas ain't eatin', I see they ribs

[Chorus]
Do a hundred all the way to the bank
I'm taking hundreds out the bank
Just bought a new car, I'ma change the paint
Big body Mulsanne, switching lanes
Two stacks just for the frame
I spent a fifty on my chain
I put the picture in the frame
I'ma roll up in the rain

[Verse 2]
My heart filled with cold pain
I'm smoking on propane
We push them foreigns back-back in the lanes
The whole gang got different chains
Pussy niggas is some stains
I'm sippin' on purple rain
I drop the top up in the rain
You niggas can't feel my pain
Lose my niggas for life, lose everything
We want the fortune, fuck the fame
Ran off with a hundred, must be insane
Man your bitch at the exchange

[Chorus]
Do a hundred all the way to the bank
I'm taking hundreds out the bank
Just bought a new car, I'ma change the paint
Big body Mulsanne, switching lanes
Two stacks just for the frame
I spent a fifty on my chain
I put the picture in the frame
I'ma roll up in the rain
