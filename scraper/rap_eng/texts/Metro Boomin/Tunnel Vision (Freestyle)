[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
I said I'm tryna practice being content
I take a pen and a pad, I meditate and I vent
I blow the smoke in the air
For my niggas who
No longer here
A lot of blood sweat, tears
Shed over the years
Was only a kid, when I started doing it big
With mama I lived
Bought the profit back to the crib
The man of the house
Now I'm thinking 'bout movin' out
Or should I cop the property and move my family south?
Fuck it, I'mma do both
And still keep the crib in Brooklyn
Just so I could post and politic it with the Pros
Kick it with some hoes, with they nipples exposed
Keep the pistol to me close
When I'm looking for the foes
Stay away from windows, is what we was told
Unless it's opportunities, just to open up some mo'
I opened a lot of doors for niggas
Five years strong and
Still got about, twenty more for niggas
Pro Era Ranger, Mighty Morphin Nigga
Keep one in the chamber
When it's time to off a nigga
Don't need a hammer to put a nail in the coffin nigga
Gimme the mic
I kill this shit often nigga
I'm the best out
You already lost my nigga
I got my chest out
City on my torso nigga
I don't even gotta speak or further talk my nigga
It's just a throwaway verse that I tossed you niggas
