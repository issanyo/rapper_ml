[Hook]
I'm like oh lord, oh lord
I got bitches wanna fuck me now, oh lord
I got niggas say they love me now, oh lord
I got all this fucking money now, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord

[Verse 1: Young Social]
I guess I'm back fucking my groupies
Living like Waka, salute me or shoot me
Pull a Future dropping five or six tapes, three albums
And I might make a movie
I ain't never really been a trap nigga
But heartbreak turned me into a trap nigga
Heartbreak inspired this rap nigga
Same Lil Seezy with a little bit of crack nigga
I flex and I stunt
Switch up my ways I might really do blunts
Fisting a bitch I call that uppercunt
And that's word to Bo Burnham, repeating some stuff
And nigga fuck dead broke, cause we dead rich
And these bullets flying till you dead bitch
I livestream drive-by's on Twitch

[Hook]
I'm like oh lord, oh lord
I got bitches wanna fuck me now, oh lord
I got niggas say they love me now, oh lord
I got all this fucking money now, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord

[Verse 2: Young Social]
Ain't gonna lie but I think I'm the man
Ain't gonna lie I been popping the Xan'
I got lean in a can, I'm so faded I can't even stand
And I'm keeping this shit too real nigga
Rocking fly shit Tommy Hilfiger
Pouring Cristal that's OG liquor
Quarter-brick, half a brick, whole brick
Your bitch throating my whole dick
Light a nigga up with a full clip
And the traphouse jumping like Jordan
Leave a nigga life in shambles
They squad can't even hold a candle
Got bad white bitches in my castle
She pop Xanax in her asshole
Driveby sound like doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Young Metro don't trust you, we shoot at you
Just like education, we schooling you
Just like first of April, we fooling you
And I ball, at the mall, never hear my conscience call
Fuck her in the bathroom stall, super smash her
Fuck and brawl

[Hook]
I'm like oh lord, oh lord
I got bitches wanna fuck me now, oh lord
I got niggas say they love me now, oh lord
I got all this fucking money now, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord

[Verse 3: Korndawg]
Since a young nigga had big dreams
Since a young nigga had big dreams
My best friend always told me to chase green
I feel like Jordan cause a nigga got on six rings
Damn I sip on the lean cause I gotta cough
A nigga so fresh and so fly a nigga get the drip from my walk
It's Korndawg and Young Social nigga
We super saiyan song my nigga
I'm a beast my nigga, you weak my nigga You stink my nigga, you smell like feet my nigga
Quarter brick half a brick whole brick
Your bitch throated the whole squad dicks
Your bitch wanna ride in my foreign
Hell nah, that bitch is dirty
Got the party jumping like Jordan
I got bitches but that not important
Can't drive cause I don't got a license
But your bitch ride me like a biker
Korndawg is so fucking lit
Bitches they love me they want the dick
Look at the red Rollie all on my wrist
Look at the red Rollie all on my bitch
Look at the flick of the wrist, whoa
Chilling in the cut with my hoes
Fuck 'em then pass 'em to my bros
We cannot fuck with none of you hoes

[Hook]
I'm like oh lord, oh lord
I got bitches wanna fuck me now, oh lord
I got niggas say they love me now, oh lord
I got all this fucking money now, oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord

[Outro: Orion Prophet]
