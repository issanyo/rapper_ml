**Verse 1**
Had a lot of fails
Now I got the power so I had to tip the scales
Hammer in the nails
Haters wanna see me in jail
Jewelry on my body chain mail

Had to switch pace
While you run in place
Diamonds in the face
We gone beat the case cos
We don't leave a trace
Got my own bad bitch, so I don't gotta chase
And she love to put on all that leather and the lace

Little did I know she'd wanna stab me
Gave her all I could just to make her happy
Sending naked pictures trying to attract me
I need music and the drugs to distract me

**Chorus**
I been in the dark seeing demons
I ain't got a heart I been scheming
Left pocket full of dead people
I've been hanging with the dead people

I've been hanging with the dead people
All I know by now is dead people
I done fell in love with dead people
Yeah I just fell in love with dead people

**Verse 2**
Now I ain't gotta talk if I don't really need to
Yeezy on my feet and that's a fucking v2
I got plenty more women, don't need you
Now I run my city, got the key too

I tried to keep it civil
See the haters how they double and they triple
If you wanna make a wave, make a ripple
Now we got a tsunami for the nipple

Ultralight beam
Tittypack the wave bitch coming for your team
You know what I mean
I'mma stay patient, I'm only 17

**Chorus**
I been in the dark seeing demons
I ain't got a heart I been scheming
Left pocket full of dead people
I've been hanging with the dead

Yeah, Yeah I've been hanging with the dead
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah I ain't playing bout my dead
Ooh, all I know is all these deads
I just fell in love with dead people
