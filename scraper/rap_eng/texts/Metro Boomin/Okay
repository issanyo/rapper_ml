[Verse 1 Lord Twinkletoes]
Falling off and on again like a roller coaster
Going to get back up and try again like a roller coaster
Ain't going to give up like a looser
I'm going to get a platinum award one day like a winner
If I never get a platinum award I'm going to give up singing
I want you girl to know If I die tomorrow I want you to find someone else because

[Chorus 1 Space Pickle]
Its okay girl I never want to see you cry
I need your attention now
I feel the people watching us
But Its okay
Its okay when we're together
Don't think about the boys

[Verse 2 Lord Twinkletoes]
Its okay girl we could dance everyday
If you die tomorrow I want you to know I love you
We could dance like its the last night of our life
Keep on dancing to the music
Its not the end of the world
We could show off
I want you girl to know If I die tomorrow I want you to find someone else because

[Chorus 2 Space Pickle]
Its okay girl I want you to be happy
I need your attention now
I feel the people watching us
But Its okay
Its okay when we're together
Don't think about the boys

[Verse 3 Space Pickle (Lord Twinkletoes)]
It is okay
When you speak to another boy
I don't really care you can do what you want
It is okay
(I want you girl to know If I die tomorrow I want you to find someone else because)

[Chorus 3 Space Pickle]
Its okay girl I don't want you to be lonely
I need your attention now
I feel the people watching us
But Its okay
Its okay when we're together
Don't think about the boys
