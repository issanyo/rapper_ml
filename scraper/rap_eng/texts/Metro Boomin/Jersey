[Hook]
First I got hip to that Shady
And then fell in love with that Yeezy
And then I heard these other niggas
And thought man this shit was too easy
I'm Stephen, I'm Stephen, I'm Stephen
Ready take the game like I'm Curry
I'm D.E.A.D. representing
Like a nigga wearing jerseys
Like a nigga wearing jerseys
Like a nigga wearing jerseys
Making this tape drove me crazy
But I swear to god it's so worth it
Even though it's for free man, no purchase
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin
You do what you want when you poppin', yeah
You do what you want when you poppin'
You do what you want when you cop it
You do what you want when you got it, yeah
You do what you want when you poppin'
You do what you want when you cop it

[Verse 1]
I ain't even done with this tape
And a nigga still plotting on his next one
Cause you know a nigga always ready to go
Cause I gotta keep this shit I'm on a roll, yeah
Mmm, my clique man we the best guys
Got more rappers than Bed-Stuy
Got mad bitches at bedside
We electrifying like Best Buy
Ya'll two-faced like Jek & Hyde
I put bars together like peptide
Laying these verses down
Like I told them bitches it's bedtime, oh

[Verse 2]
I got 30 chains on my neck and 30k on my wrist
And I still need that jacket, cause my flow is cold as shit
I got so many bands, I can't even hold the shit
And my tape is so sick, yeah this that Ebola shit
You got wings on your plate, I got wings on my jet
Give me 16 bars and nigga I'mma kill it, that's a bet
I be balling on these hoes like Reggie Miller, that's bet
I just went to the club, and I balled like Hasselbeck
And my nigga don't forget that this shit V.E.N.D
Gotta put on for The Groove, that's that 21613
Gotta put on for my state, yeah my nigga that's MD
And I think I'm in a Groove cause I'm from that Groove City
