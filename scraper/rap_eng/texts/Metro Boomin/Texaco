[Intro: YOMI]
Aye what up Metro Metro?
Hey

[Chorus: YOMI]
You see me doing my thang
This shit don't change
Hating on me ain't gonna solve a damn thing
They loving the lingo
They down with the Lang
They fuck with a nigga
Right straight off the face
I ain't rushing perfection
I stick to my pace
I don't fuck with these niggas
I stick to myself
I ain't chasing these bitches
Ain't chasing no liquor
I'm chasing my chances
You could be my victim

[Verse 1: YOMI]
Dropping more niggas them Columbine
Hitting your bitch just like Gangnam style
It will be alright in due time
Just roll the dice I'm tryna get to Dubai
And Abu Dabi escape all the choppers choppers cause they
Knocking niggas down like Pakistan
No boxing got 100 rounds
Can't be stagnant got 100 sounds
Ain't no telling what a nigga like me a do
I like my blunt real fat I like my cup full
I like my girl real thick I like to drive coupes
I let her drive real fast just like she should do
Ebliarmy call me Yomi for short
I’mma smoke this whole cig
I ain't bussing you shorts
South side nigga finesse you on your porch
Look at your sacks your grams just came up short just in case we come face to face nigga Anticipate I'll even catch the case
You can't be mad at me
At the end of the day
I'm tryna get the money some way

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lucki Eck$]
Let these bitches know, and all these niggas know
Too I’m clutch all through the gold
Brand Marshall go-to
I work with you on phonin’ fo’
But look you pop too much
I said, boy I’m pure perfection
I be passin’ what that rush
I been on my shit, I’m back again
Just a few more birds bitch
Bossy rockin’ shows now, still be forgetting words and shit
Went to MIA tried Alapier, coulda went M.I.A
Met this bitch, I love her
Forgot her name and fucking face
My whole set need bar-for-bar
Battling on Xan’ shit
Attitude remind me of late-90s McMahon shit
My whole set need bar-for-bar
Battling on Xan’ shit
Attitude remind me of late-90s McMahon shit
