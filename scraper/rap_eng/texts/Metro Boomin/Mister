[Intro]
Mister (x3)
Hey Mister
Mister (x3)

[Hook: Young Thug]
I don't give no fuck about you
Just make sure you ball me mister
Hundred thousand dancers in my house
Just make sure you ball me mister
I live my life just like a mister
I fuck these hoes just like a mister
I treat your bitch like they no mister
I live my life just like a mister

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Thugga Thugga throw a hundred bands off in a day
Thugga Thugga throw a hundred bands on anybody
Fuck niggas know we got them bodies
Fuck nigga slimin' is a habit
Throw them bands rack-cakes turn to flipper
Thugga goin' crazy shootin' missiles
(Blahh blahh) Man down, stand down
Wassup, young round, you slime? Hands down!
I cash out so fast and I head straight to any town
Young Thugger, Young Thugger got Migos with 40 pounds
I told my young vato he shoot up, you goin' down
Mister, Mister, Mister, Mister, lay it down

[Hook: Young Thug]
I don't give no fuck about you
Just make sure you ball me mister
Hundred thousand dancers in my house
Just make sure you ball me mister
I live my life just like a mister
I fuck these hoes just like a mister
I treat your bitch like they no mister
I live my life just like a mister


[Verse 2: Wavy Wallace]
All the hoes they know my name, but you gotta call me mister
I'm workin' ho right on my Insta, [?] got work off Insta
Thugger droppin' bombs, and I'm letting off the missile
Thugger baby don't miss 'em, probably fuck a friend of her sister
Young nigga you better listen, my money claimed by my position
So many claim that they ball, when they ain’t even Scottie Pippen
They name my bank roll “David Blaine”, ‘cause my shit a magician
This shit just start doin’ tricks, [?] how it just start flippin’
Yeah I might spend my money on my bitch, but that don’t mean that I’m shrinkin’
And it’s something I’m sipping Moet, but that don’t mean that I’m trippin’
A lot of my woes is Blood, the rest of my niggas is Crip
They gives no fuck about your position, so make sure you call me mister

[Hook: Young Thug]
I don't give no fuck about you
Just make sure you ball me mister
Hundred thousand dancers in my house
Just make sure you ball me mister
I live my life just like a mister
I fuck these hoes just like a mister
I treat your bitch like they no mister
I live my life just like a mister
