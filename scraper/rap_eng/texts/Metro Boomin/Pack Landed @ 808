[Intro]
Wake up early sippin this shit (Ok, Ok)
For real...
For real, for real
(Come on!)

[Chorus]
Aye, okay okay okay okay
The plug called, said the pack landed at 8:08
Pour a pint, drink the pain away away away
I can't fuck no dusty bitch no way, no way, no way
Reagan Era, selling base like its '88
Diamonds red like they rain, they rain, they rain, they rain
Since I got famous all my friends they changed, they changed, they changed
And I can't never fuck with them niggas never again

[Verse 1]
Sell a bitch a dream, just like I sell cocaine
I'm a pimp Magic Juan in his younger days
Try to rob, you get killed, that's the price you pay
Benihana, yum yum sauce, chicken shrimp and steak
Hi Tech and Sprite, damn I love the taste
Murder one on that pussy like a open case
A thousand ones, I just throwed away, away, away
Spend that shit up and let's get it back today, today
All my niggas got dreads like we in Haiti
If I fuck that bitch you best believe she pay me
You got the coodest bitch, I think you might have rabies
Percocets got me itchin' like it's scabies
Diamonds on water, bring the jetskis
Instagram countin' money made them hate me
Bitch I'm savage just like 21
Posted in that trap house with like twenty guns

[Chorus]
Aye, okay okay okay okay
The plug called, said the pack landed at 8:08
Pour a pint, drink the pain away away away
I can't fuck no dusty bitch no way, no way, no way
Reagan Era, selling base like its '88
Diamonds red like they rain, they rain, they rain, they rain
Since I got famous all my friends they changed, they changed, they changed
And I can't never fuck with them niggas never again

[Verse 2]
Sold a brick, hit the jeweler, flooded out the bracelet
Christian Loub, Jimmy Choos, Gucci shoes, my lady
Philip Lim, Japanese, I don't do no basic
B cups, ass shots, gave that bitch a face lift
I can build a bitch like a old school
Put a hoe on the track like she Pro Tools
Try me is what you won't do
Make sure I don't trust you
That Nephy finna rob you
All my trap houses they got burglar bars
I'm richer than a bitch I got like 30 cars
I got like 30 broads
Made a laid back in the Wraith, and gazed up at the stars
Diamonds in my watch look like crack rocks
Ballin' on these niggas bring the black top
Burnin' kush like its Woodstock
AK47 with the wood stop

[Chorus]
Aye, okay okay okay okay
The plug called, said the pack landed at 8:08
Pour a pint, drink the pain away away away
I can't fuck no dusty bitch no way, no way, no way
Reagan Era, selling base like its '88
Diamonds red like they rain, they rain, they rain, they rain
Since I got famous all my friends they changed, they changed, they changed
And I can't never fuck with them niggas never again
