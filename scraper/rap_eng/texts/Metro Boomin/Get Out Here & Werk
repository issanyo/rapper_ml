[Hook]
Nigga stuntin' for 'em bandz, betta get up there and werk
Niggas wanna be the man, betta get up there and werk
If you don't comprehend, betta get up there and werk
Still standin' on the porch, betta get up there and werk
Look, all this ballin' got a nigga starvin' for more of that cash
But it ain't no problem, I swear that we gon' run it all
Stay out here, we count it up!

[Verse 1]
Aye, look, started from no hand outs
Box' Chevy land out
You the type who ran off
We the type to stand off
Started from nothin' and made our way up through it
Niggas hate, swear to God, what's yo issue?
My nigga sold in choppas, poppin' the pistols
Green light on niggas, all it take is a whistle
Came a long way off a 30 or a 100 pack
Call me righ, no Cunningham
Quarterback a play, guarantee you make a quarterback
If I don't give this to you the next day when you order back
Nigga, fuck with the money, fuck around and get missing
Fuck up the actions and give me a session and back to the kitchen
In the kitchen, water, whipping the fuck of the parlay
My chick do the dishes, my bitch get to missin' when I tell her listen
We grind out the money, get it from the trenches
Starvin' for the bandz, nigga betta werk
Throwin' money in the air, bitch stand up on the chair
She a-show me how to twerk

[Hook]
Nigga stuntin' for 'em bandz, betta get up there and werk
Niggas wanna be the man, betta get up there and werk
If you don't comprehend, betta get up there and werk
Still standin' on the porch, betta get up there and werk
Look, all this ballin' got a nigga starvin' for more of that cash
But it ain't no problem, I swear that we gon' run it all
Stay out here, we count it up!

[Verse 2]
Aye, deuce on the deucy
One shot, I got a screw face
Throw case, I gotta wear a suit
I left my lawyer with a suitcase
Coming off the top like toupe
Every song is a movie (movie)
Niggas takin' all that fucking molly
Turning into fuckin' pookies (damn)
I used to pay the Jay to change the (oh)
I used to pay the Jays for all my (ah)
I used to get mine off of Gobey row
Got my first grill off of 10-4
Rollin' on niggas like give and go
You niggas ain't ready for anymore
And if money would grow on trees
The tree that I got would become a sycamore
I pull in the parkin' lot creepin' low
I might jump 'er off at the liquor store
She might try to ride on my tag number
What you think I got a watcher fo'?
What you think I got my mental from?
What you think I got credentials from?
What you think I got potential from?
Shit, I'm smokin' this loud as an Intercom

[Hook]
Nigga stuntin' for 'em bandz, betta get up there and werk
Niggas wanna be the man, betta get up there and werk
If you don't comprehend, betta get up there and werk
Still standin' on the porch, betta get up there and werk

But it ain't no problem, I swear that we gon' run it all
Stay out here, we count it up!
