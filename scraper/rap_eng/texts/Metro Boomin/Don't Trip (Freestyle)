[Verse]
Smoking mid up in my nigga's whip
Everclear straight, 100 proof, I'll take a sip
Hella fucked up but nigga I don't trip
Hella fucked up but nigga I don't trip
Turning up, nigga I ain't new to this
We got them drugs but we gon hit a lick
Run up in your house, where the muthafucking dope at bitch
Leggo, leggo, leggo, we sprinting can't catch us bitch
Word Play y'all know that he don't give no fucks
Bullets got aim nigga this ain't no Andrew Luck
These Last Kings hats costed some bills like the Mighty Ducks
Your bitch is digging my swag so I'm 'bout to fuck
Vagina, currency, and narcotics
That's what I'm 'bout, and nigga fuck the opps
North Side rider nigga I ain't gon ever stop
North Side Saint Louis nigga I ain't gon ever stop
We can fight bruh I ain't gon run like HJK
Hit you with the left then right, you gon get slain
I'll rock your ass 'cause I'm fast and furious okay
Get away with murder like I'm young OJ
I'm thinking 'bout moving to Canada but I know they gon still be watching me
I roll with my nigga I'm gon be like Hot Spitta and get my currency
I'm thinking 'bout moving to Italy 'cause they got big bitches all 'round the sea
Having a bitch hitting falsettos like The Dream, you know me
KON turn up spot, bitch come and slide through hoe
And smoke this cabbage up it's good for your soul
Stay turning up from Thursday to Sunday
Verbs on the jungle gym, that's Word Play, gone!
