[Intro]
Pulled up like Fed Ex
Double R headrest
Money power respect
Tryna make that bread stretch

[Verse 1]
Valet park the Spider at the stadium
Really got the cars them boys say they in
Level 6 armored the Mercedes Benz
Feeling like Ox in this bitch smoking big lobster claws
Butter sauce but of course
Brought myself up, became a boss on no days off
Sycamore Style, my Wallabee Clarks
Marble cake catching plays from my loft
I made a million just to make this phone call
Homie please, adapt to your surroundings
You surrounded my some G's
They know you pussy they been observing the way you breathe
They might tighten you up a little bit before you leave
The rats get cracked when the python squeeze
It's animal kingdom in these streets
You gotta be a man and a beast
Gotta keep one eye open when you sleep
Might have to kill something just to eat

[Chorus]
Pulled up like Fed Ex
Double R headrest
Money power respect
Tryna make that bread stretch
Pulled up like Fed Ex
Double R headrest
Been killing 'em like a drive by
Is y'all dead yet?
Pulled up like Fed Ex, yea
Pulled up like Fed Ex

[Verse 2]
Camouflage Rolls Royce don
Umbrellas in the lead shower things get torn apart
Every bar I write another war I start
As my wishlist becomes a list of things I've bought
No regrets for the necks I stepped on none of that was wrong
Because all of this is all I want
How could you blame me when the hustle made me
Money crazy stacking daily
Only way to be, so says me
Audio dope, check it for the [?]
And then you pay me risk taking got that money raining
Baby, you played yourself thinking you could ever play me
Waiting for my downfall it's gon' be a long night
I'm too high to land homie this gon' be a long flight
Money run, we get it done before the sun lights
Plan executed to the letter
More money then you seen in your life ever, ever

[Chorus]
Pulled up like Fed Ex
Double R headrest
Money power respect
Tryna make that bread stretch
Pulled up like Fed Ex
Double R headrest
Been killing 'em like a drive by
Is y'all dead yet?
Pulled up like Fed Ex, yea
Pulled up like Fed Ex
