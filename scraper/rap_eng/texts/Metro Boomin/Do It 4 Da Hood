[Intro: PeeWee Longway]
Young Nigga Do it 4 Da Hood
Metro a Fool

[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
Jumped off the porch bombs in the woods
Young Nigga Do It 4 Da Hood
Get it out the mud how a Young Nigga get it
OG Gas Bag how a Nigga Juug
When the plug get to ya' with the choppers
Young Nigga dreaded like Rastas
Menace to Society like O-Dog
Young Nigga Do it 4 Da Hood

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Jumpin' off the porch with a big bomb in my nuts
Fuck 12 tryna run the check up
Teacher told me I was next up
Young Nigga do it 4 Da Hood
The way a young nigga slangin’ them drugs
(Move that dope) Brick fair in all my pockets
Bringing’ all the young niggas up to the socket
Streets on lock, Do it for the hood nigga
You a blood or a crop throw it up lil nigga
2 singles in a throw em up hood
Double wrist rollie my neck of the woods
Switcharoo bitches on top of the hood
Heard they wanna be bosses live real good
Runnin’ round the lobby my bachelor bad
Bands in pants like a Maxi-pad
Always blood on the money pussy nigga
African Diamonds keep bugging’ these bitches
Pull up in the drop like Double R switch
Falesha Falesha you thot chasin
I Dream of Jeanie my bitches are hot
Got it out the mud so I trap out the Yacht
Plottin’ on my spot we gon knock off your top
Menace to Society like O-Dog
Young Nigga shooting’ them choppers
Longway Bitch

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Taylorband band camp going for the headshot
Hair-kari nigga at the red-light
Young nigga Do It 4 Da Hood
Take that fuck nigga borrowing me some fed lights
Young Niggas in the Hood
I don’t give a fuck about pussy niggas
20 bands on his head get his mind right
Young Thug niggas in the hood slime life
SK Chopper with knifes, you contradicting your life (knew you would do it)
Young niggas bite like piranhas, they don’t give a fuck bout they life
More stupid that crocodile hunters, more wicked than poltergeist
Fuckin these bitches with double rubbers
Ain’t none of these bitches lady-like
Diddy boppin bitch my money right
I got a wrist game show you how to get it right
Trappin’ these bricks off a mini bike
1008 grams thats a Trapper Life
I just lost count at the money machine
Got a million in my bag 250 in my pocket
Thats why I came in with the pocket rocket
If you don’t like it then don’t try it
