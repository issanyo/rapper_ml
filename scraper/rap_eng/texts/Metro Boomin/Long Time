[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I've been on my motherfuckin' grind
For a very, very, long-long time
Yeah, so I deserve to ball like Kobe
For a very, very, long-long time
Yeah, got a bad oriental girl
She said she love me, love me, long-long time
Yeah, and I don't fuck with no new niggas
We've been homies for a long-long time

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, I've been fuckin' on your bitch for two hours
That's a long-long time
Uh, I made her come in two minutes
That's a very, very, short-short time
For our first time
My bitch keep callin', told her it's the wrong time
On the west side we say blood not slime
All my niggas with me, Taylor Gang or die
I just came to bag a bad little bitch
I'm with some bloods, pirus, and some crips
Took your bitch and fucked her in a foreign whip
She sucked my dick for a new outfit (Weezy)

[Verse 2: Quavo]
You cuffin' that ho for a long time
No, no, can't be wifin' that bitch
I took her, only hit her one time
(Smash, smash, smash, smash)
Free my niggas doin' long time
Free my niggas doin' long time
I keep the plug on my phone line (brrrr)
I put the dope in her panties
Pipe it up, that's a new habit
Dabbin' is a way of fashion
Pull up on 'em like Aladin
I got a strap in my jacket
She fuckin' me, she gon' keep braggin'
Million dollars in the mansion
I wake up, she cookin' me breakfast
I get the pack, adios
Shoutout to my migos in the barrio
Eni-meney-miney-mo
Which one of you niggas wanna play a ghost
I pull out the Lamb, pull up in the Ghost
30k for the Migos to host
Ice on my neck and I ice out my foes
Long time goin' down that road
