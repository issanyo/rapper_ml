[Intro]
On me, look at all this money on me

[Hook]
Look at all this money on me
Look at that designer on me
The bad bitches waitin' on me
That's why them niggas hatin' on me
Look at all this money on me
Look at that designer on me
The bad bitches waitin' on me
That's why them niggas hatin' on me

[Verse 1]
Them was waitin' on them niggas, I was fucked up
I stayed down long enough and got my bag up
I spent a profit, boy, I'm still put my bag up
200 on the dash, I'm tryna tear the dash up
That new Wraith with the stars is comin', I'm gonna get one
Paid cash for it, you know I spend that brick money
Hang round bosses, a nigga love to get money
Flexin' on the 'gram, you showin' your bitch with money
Nigga, you a hoe, boy
Actin' just like old boy
Pull up in that new toy
Lookin' like a dope boy
Like a dope boy?
Young nigga, I'm for real
Ballin' with no deal
Spend a whole half a mill

[Hook]
Look at all this money on me
Look at that designer on me
The bad bitches waitin' on me
That's why them niggas hatin' on me
Look at all this money on me
Look at that designer on me
The bad bitches waitin' on me
That's why them niggas hatin' on me

[Verse 2]
Young nigga got the cash flow
So much money, man, I could fight the tax foes
And all my niggas 100
Swear to God, nigga never took nothin' from me
Young nigga got the base soda
Hit a lick and went and got all my niggas Dracos
So you don't want no beef
They'll pull up on your side, leave you with a slow leak
They gon' have homicide, toe tag on your feet
First 48, the case closed
All my niggas 100 and they won't fold
That mean the story goin' untold

[Hook]
Look at all this money on me
Look at that designer on me
The bad bitches waitin' on me
That's why them niggas hatin' on me
Look at all this money on me
Look at that designer on me
The bad bitches waitin' on me
That's why them niggas hatin' on me
