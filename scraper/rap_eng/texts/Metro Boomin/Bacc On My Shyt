[Intro:]
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus:]
I’m back on my shit [x9]
Rolling back on my wrist
Shorty back with the shit
Schooling back with the hips
Ok I’m back on my shit
I’m back on my shit [x3]
Ok

[Verse 1:]
Get all black on this shit
I got black in this bitch
Ya’ll no stay in this shit
I spent rags on these kicks
I got rags from your bitch keep them straps on my hips
Please don't trip you get flipped
I got high when i sip
Two grams and backwards when i hit
Gotta know how to act with this shit
The’ll pull a cap for this shit
Nigga pussy we call the monkeys got bananas for them
GDs, Crips, & Bloods got bandanas with them
If you trippin in a club ain't no handling them this ain't no amature shit
Around no camera and shit catch me dancing and shit
I was always out with them killing
See i was the man with them kids while i’m laying with your bitch

[Chorus] [x9]

The were asking for it
Amma keep it black with this shit

Woo woo she on that pole i need glasses for this
It's on for your thong clap your ass for this shit
Work your back to this shit

Then go get all you can get
Go home stack it then flip
Ok you back in this bitch

Flood the bank with this shit

Put your ass into gear
Put your back and put your back

Singing rapping and shit pussy

[Chorus]
