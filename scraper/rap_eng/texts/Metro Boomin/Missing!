[Hook]
I get the pack and go missin'
I might just shoot at your children
Watch how you talk and we listen
Look at the diamonds they glisten

[Verse]
Maison Margiela my wrist
Maison Margiela my bitch
I'mma just flip me a brick
Keep me a bag on my wrist
I did it all for the family
All of these fuckers can't stand me
Bitch, I'm shinin' like harry
I just got head in the bentley
All of my niggas got tools
We shitin, I shit on your crew
I might just masion the shoe
I might just masion your boo
The Fendi don't cost me a check
I did it all for respect
My shooter, they aim at your neck
They bust at lil bro in a day
The Fendi don't cost me a check
I did it all for respect
My shooter, they aim at your neck
They bust at lil bro in a day
I got stripes like Adidas
Bitch, I'm hot, I defeat it
I might just sing like a Beatle
I put that 8 in the liter
I get it, still get it I go
Fendi the snip f the shoe
They copy they wanna be you
I fuck on this bitch and the crew
(?) I be shootin like tony
I be the boss, you a phony
Sorry sir, we are no homies
Sorry sir, we are no homies
(?)
All of these goes they blow me
All of these niggas they clone me
They all me, they all me

[Hook]
I get the pack and go missin'
I might just shoot at your children
Watch how you talk and we listen
Look at the diamonds they glisten
I get the pack and go missin'
I get the pack and go missin'
I get the pack and go missin'
I get the pack and go missin'
