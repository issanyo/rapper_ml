[Hook: MPA Wicced & Young Thug]
Air that shit out, air that shit out
Don't  make me come over there
Air that shit out, air that shit out
Air that shit out, air that shit out
Air that shit out, air that shit out
You not what you talk about
I have killers at your house
You know YSL en route
Make ‘em pull up and hop out
Air that shit out, air that shit out
Air that shit out, air that shit out

[Verse 1 - Young Thug]
People pull up in the Bentley and hop out
And air your ass out and say sorry to children
Squeezin on innocent bystanders
That’s what they get for just chillin'
First you was dissin', now that boy missin'
Pillow talkin' to these bitches
But when he see me he quiet like detention
Pussy niggas I see right through 'em
Shoot him in his pat like Ewing
F&N meet a nigga fluid
Now the little nigga can’t urine
Hating on a nigga, I can’t do it
Meanwhile he hating, YSL getting yay, screaming aye
What you doin'?
I'mma treat him like Section 8 put his ass in his place
I'mma look a nigga in the face, make him turn Christian like Ma$e
Only say one word and it’s “Aye”
Then I'm gon' rearrange his face
Hit him with 3 like Reggie Miller
He not bout that Percy Miller
When I catch your ho I dick her

[Hook]
Air that shit out, air that shit out
Don't  make me come over there
Air that shit out, air that shit out
Air that shit out, air that shit out
Air that shit out, air that shit out
You not what you talk about
I have killers at your house
You know YSL en route
Make ‘em pull up and hop out
Air that shit out, air that shit out
Air that shit out, air that shit out

[Verse 2 - MPA Wicced]
Air that shit out! Air that shit out!
What the fuck you gon do when you see Wicced en route?
I got a choppa bigger than Lil Bow Wow
Just like Nick with the Cannon I be Wild'N Out
Van full of killers, ski masks, with them gold in their mouths
Kick the door down shoot the first nigga laying on the couch
Send Thugga Thugga in that bitch "Go strip down the house"
(Aye Thugga, Clear 'em out)
Found ten bricks, quarter million laying in the couch
Love when the beef in the air bring them chopsticks out
Kickin that gangsta boy you know that what you ain't bout
Killers on top of your roof peepin you out
Im from the same area as Ace Boogie shots to ya face!

[Hook]
Air that shit out, air that shit out
Don't  make me come over there
Air that shit out, air that shit out
Air that shit out, air that shit out
Air that shit out, air that shit out
You not what you talk about
I have killers at your house
You know YSL en route
Make ‘em pull up and hop out
Air that shit out, air that shit out
Air that shit out, air that shit out
