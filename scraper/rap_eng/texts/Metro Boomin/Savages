(Crack, crack, crack)

[Hook: CrackTheSafe]
It's CrackTheSafe, I'm on some savage shit
Put your money in my bag and then I'm vanishing
Put your money in my bag and then I'm vanishing
I'm from a different planet didn't plan this shit
I'm from a different planet didn't plan this shit
If you didn't understand then understand this shit
If you didn't understand then understand this shit
I still don't give a damn, I'ma damage it

[Verse 1: CrackTheSafe]
They ain't got a bandage for the damages
So how the hell they gonna manage when I handle shit?
They said a 38 is what I'm brandishin
Somebody said I shot somebody but I haven't yet
I'm going savage with my savages
It's looking like I'm shipping baggage flipping packages
It's looking like you tripping acid as i rap this shit
I got your ass believing in magic now you imagine it
I'm going savage with my savages
You prolly find me on a path that's filled with pathogens
I'm searching for a passage through these passages
I'm swerving through the traffic with passengers as I'm passing shit
I'm puffing lavish and I'm ashing it
Bitch I feel like Cassius and I'm smashing it
I swear my competition got me laughing, man..
And I ain't even boasting or bragging  about what's happening
These rappers be sounding like Cat in the Hat, tatted all up going RATATATAT
Claiming they're high and they're saying they're flying first class but we know that they sat in the back
As a matter of fact, It's a matter of time before the music we make take them back to the past
It don't matter right now, what matters right now is the "Hibidee bibidee-badabadah"
Snoop said it best, these rappers are wack
Now they scatter the map tossing trash on a track
Watch them fall off in a couple of years
For a couple of years, I've been stashing my cash
In a couple of years, I'll be packing my bags...
Trip to the top and I'm not coming back
Words are my weapon it's rapid attack
I'ma send them to heaven, I kill them with crack
(Crack, crack, crack)

[Hook: CrackTheSafe]
It's CrackTheSafe, I'm on some savage shit
Put your money in my bag and then I'm vanishing
Put your money in my bag and then I'm vanishing
I'm from a different planet didn't plan this shit
I'm from a different planet didn't plan this shit
If you didn't understand then understand this shit
If you didn't understand then understand this shit
I still don't give a damn, i'ma damage it
