(In love with yourself)

[Verse]
Checking your reflection is what really turns you on
And you're loving every minute thinking everyone has gone
You just roll your eyes and you fantasize
Think you're number one

[Chorus]
So in love with yourself
How could you love somebody else?
So in love with yourself
How could you love somebody else?

[Verse 2]
Always out at every party so the pain don't show
Talking too much, laughing too loud so that everybody knows
But the joke's on you (the joke's on you)
And you're such a fool (you're such a fool)
That's the way it goes

[Chorus]
So in love with yourself
How could you love somebody else?
So in love with yourself
How could you love somebody else?
(In love with yourself)
So in love with yourself
(In love with yourself)

[Bridge]
Checking your reflection is what really turns you on
And you're loving every minute thinking everyone has gone
You just roll your eyes and you fantasize
Think you're number one

[Chorus]
So in love with yourself
How could you love somebody else?
So in love with yourself
How could you love somebody else?
(In love with yourself)
So in love with yourself
(In love with yourself)
So in love with yourself

The joke's on you, you're such a fool
