[Chorus:] Anthony Daquon
Eternally, I’ll love you from the bottom of me
Unconditionally
But I probably should leave because all of me
Don’t want you, no more

I’ll go away, far away
But you’ll still be my trophy

[Verse 1:] Henrī
You’re my greatest trophy, you’re made of gold
You wanna buy my heart well it’s sold to you, I swear
That I told tell lies baby, beauty got me foaming at the mouth like rabies

I wish I had the time to fix all my mistakes, the faults in my design
And I know it will take more than a verse or a rhyme
But I’m trying to make miracles, make stars come align?
I think that you was unaware how much I cared about your love
Cause you was busy, telling lies I couldn't bare
And having trust in the relationship was kinda rare
Because the same heart that you loved me with, you tried to share
With other men, girl you lied to me you said they don’t compare
And drinking, oh all that drinking

I know you drink to take the pain away
So I stay to build the confidence in you to make the change, but you’re deranged
Mental asylum baby you crazy, insane
You let this love die you should be ashamed
But maybe I coulda helped, maybe I’m to blame

But if it wasn’t for all that, huh
Every morning would be a good morning, waking up to you
Saying good morning, to that pretty face, with those pretty eyes
Got me hypnotized, watch the sunrise thinking
This can’t get any better
I hope this feeling last forever, I hope it never rains, on a sunny weather

[Chorus]
