[Hook: Zuse]
I don't talk, pussy nigga, better pipe down
If I want it, I'mma take it, nigga, right now
You be flexin' round this bitch like this ain't my town
Run up in yo' crib, yo' bitch all in a night gown
Mayday! Man down! Mayday! Man down!
You be flexin' round this bitch like this ain't my town
Run up in yo' crib, ya in ya night gown

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
First off, I'mma fuck up your head like a tumor
Let my dog chase yo' ass down like a puma
I had to show that I'm looney, now they tuned to us
So many rollies, I'm like "Which?", no broom in us
I know these pussy muhfuckas wanna see me dead
I know my eye not bleeding but all I ever see is red
I got them demons 'round my back, I just nickname 'em pets
That pussy water, I'm a dolphin like a fuckin' egg
Run, run, these niggas in trouble, lil' nigga
Zuse'll get 'em, he shootin' like pride, no nickels
Hundred bands, hundred bands, pull up at your spot
For a hundred bands, shoot a hundred shots
Beat the nigga bad till he got a hundred knots
Only thing I wanna know "What's the deal?", no Scott

[Hook]
I don't talk, pussy nigga, better pipe down
If I want it, I'mma take it, nigga, right now
You be flexin' round this bitch like this ain't my town
Run up in yo' crib, yo' bitch all in a night gown
Mayday! Man down! Mayday! Man down!
You be flexin' round this bitch like this ain't my town
Run up in yo' crib, ya in ya night gown


[Verse 2: Zuse]
Mayday, man down, Kingston nigga run ya damn town
Oh, Thugga, we gon' kill them niggas, hands down
Stand down or get shot where ya stand now
Don't get caught like a bitch with your pants down
I don't give a fuck and I don't really give a damn now
Life got stopped like a truck gettin' fanned down
Thugga, what we got? Cash money, got the bands now
MAC-10 fry y'all niggas like a hash brown
Every nigga touch the damn ground
No, you can't hide, pussy nigga, get dragged out
"Mayday!" That's y'all when you land down

[Hook]
I don't talk, pussy nigga, better pipe down
If I want it, I'mma take it, nigga, right now
You be flexin' round this bitch like this ain't my town
Run up in yo' crib, yo' bitch all in a night gown
Mayday! Man down! Mayday! Man down!
You be flexin' round this bitch like this ain't my town
Run up in yo' crib, ya in ya night gown
