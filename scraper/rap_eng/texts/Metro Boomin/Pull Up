[Intro]
Shoot, shoot, brrr
Haha, yeah, yeah
Metro Loaded, Loaded Boomin

[Chorus]
You say you gon' pull up, you ain't gon' shoot, shoot, shoot
Do the dash in that coupe, coupe, coupe (coupe)
My dawgs pull up we out the roof, roof, roof (roof, roof)
Fuck with Loaded, that's a fluke, fluke, fluke (brrt, brrt)
Balenciaga on my shoe, shoe, shoe (shoe, shoe)
I spend rackades, I spend loot, loot, loot (racks)
Next year at Met Gala in a two-piece suit (Dior)
Rockin' brrr, I'm rockin' Gu-Gu-Gu (Gu, Gu)

Goodness gracious (goodness gracious)
The whip is spacious (skrrt, skrrt)
My bitch caucasian
Give that ho a facial (git, git)
A human glacier (wow)
They makin' sad faces (wow)
I'm with a bad ghetto bitch and her name Lil Asia (Lil Asia)
My hobby so contagious (money)
Stackin' dead faces (woah)
My brother beatin' cases (beatin' cases)
My buddy switch locations (woo)

New spot, I relocated (I relocated)
Don't do no pump, no fakin'

[Chorus]
You say you gon' pull up, you ain't gon' shoot, shoot, shoot
Do the dash in that coupe, coupe, coupe (coupe)
My dawgs pull up we out the roof, roof, roof (roof, roof)
Fuck with Loaded, that's a fluke, fluke, fluke (brrt, brrt)

[Verse 2]
Loso Loaded
Holy moly (holy moly)
They can't control me (they can't control me)
Ball like Ginobili (I'm ballin')
My bankroll ain't foldin' (two step)
Big boy Tonka (big boy Tonka)
He talkin' cash, trunk him (gimme that)
I'm out that jungle (out that jungle)
Now I'm talkin' hundreds (Loaded)
We sip codeine (codeine)
We don't sip no green
The bases loaded (bases loaded)
Diamonds bling bling bling (bling bling bling)
Pull up, murder (skrrt, skrrt)
Hold up, kill that sing
Amir is loaded
Pockets ching ching ching
I put the hashtag on the titties
I put the hashtag on a fitted
I got the cash jumpin' like a frog
I seen the bankroll do the [?]
I'm with Young Metro and he's loaded
I got the trap house and they rollin'
Nigga, tried to start up some commotion
[?] Givenchy tag in the ocean

[Chorus]
You say you gon' pull up, you ain't gon' shoot, shoot, shoot
Do the dash in that coupe, coupe, coupe (coupe)
My dawgs pull up we out the roof, roof, roof (roof, roof)
Fuck with Loaded, that's a fluke, fluke, fluke (brrt, brrt)
Balenciaga on my shoe, shoe, shoe (shoe, shoe)
I spend rackades, I spend loot, loot, loot (racks)
