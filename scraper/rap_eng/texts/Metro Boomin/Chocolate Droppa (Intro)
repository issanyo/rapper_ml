"If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you..."

[Intro: Kevin Hart]
Ha ha!
You recognize the voice, bitch!
And that's with a capital "Z."
Yeah. You know what it is
And it's funny when I leave everybody try to go and take over, man
I'm talking to you, Drake. I'm talking to you, Hov. I'm talking to you, 'Ye. I'm talking to you, Tip. I'm talking to you, Nelly. I'm talking to you, 2 Chainz. I'm talking to you, Macklemore
I'm talking to every motherfuckin' rapper that's ever touched a microphone
You fucked up when you started rapping, nigga!
Ha haaaa!
I'm about to spit this fire!
Somebody better check this microphone 'cause I'm about to burn this bitch!
And I ain't talking about with my breath, hoe
Uh, let's get it, let's get it, let's get it, uh, let's get it
That's that bounce - that's what I wanted right there
Here I come, watch this...

[Verse]
Yo, 34 slims, that's my size, yeah, that's my size
I'm a petite nigga, on the rise, on the rise
I'm, no, no fear in me, uh, no fear in me
Got nothing but keys, in my wifey
I'm talking 'bout real keys, open up any door
I ain't talking 'bout drugs, that'd put you on the bottom floor
I'm a real nigga, real shit
Talk to you, I'm a real bitch

[Outro]
Hey, wait, what? Shit! Did I call myself a bitch, Metro?
Did I just call myself a bitch?
Can we back that up?
'cause if I call myself a bitch... You gotta delete that!
I didn't want it to go there!
Fuck it, let's ride it out
We gon' figure it out, 'cause you can get it in the edit
Let's get it
Y'all asked for it, you got it
Question of the day is... What now?
