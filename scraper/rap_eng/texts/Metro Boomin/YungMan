[Verse 1]
Fuck an introduction, just make sure you play this. Fucking up my lungs, but I'll still fucking say shit. MCM from yo bitch, got them notifications enabled. Mood just like an Indie, but I sound amazing
Cop some extra butter, that's just how I dip it. Fucked her in the kitchen, bitch don't touch my dishes. Always with a bitch, I feel like Daniel Gibson, woah. Hit my homie Rollie, need my wrist to glisten
Fucked up my last Gucci, so I bought another pair. Squad right here, and they gone hunt the block just like a bear. Fucked up at the opera, now I'm so exhausted. I won't make the move until you send a posit, wow. Pay 30 for a walk thru if I'm preaching, wow. Can you just imagine what I make this season? Ow
I can't trust these bitches, I got my reasons. I just want the green like I'm a fucking vegan. I can spot a hater from across the room. Mary wanted Henny, that's what she consume. Told that hoe I might just let her touch the tip. Aye. Minutes later, my dick smell like her perfume

[Verse 2]
We gone get it started, man they out here tripping. Knowing I'm the realest, know that I'm gone kill it. Shot my hitta mane we had to pay a visit. Hit em with the track, I scream who finna get it? Diamonds steady dancing, moonwalk on my wrist. You not getting money, bitch you don't exist. Took my hoe to McDonald's, told her order up. The ratchet bitches, all they get is tender crisp. At Burger King, bitch I'm a king, let's make that crank. Got shit under pillow, 'case you tryna play. No I ain't no killer, but this shit'll spray. Plug in with the plug, boy they  love them drugs. You is lame in school, boy you not a thug. Bought my bitch some Roshes, you bought yo' bitch Uggs. Boy you fucking broke, ain't got no change for doves. The other day was my first time feeling strong B. All we need is mics bruh, let's fucking party. Smoke blow out the window. Smoking outdoor endo. Yeah
