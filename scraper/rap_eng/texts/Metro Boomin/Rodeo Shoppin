(Intro)
Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh

You hear me knocking?
Smell me?

It's me the dawg
Where you at?

(Chorus)
I'm on Rodeo shoppin', Balenziaga coppin'
Nigga what's poppin? What's inside your pockets?
Just left Melrose, with 'bout 12 hoes
Bricks in elbows, and three cellphones
Flights to Bal Harbour,  Got Chanel on order
Diamonds clearer than water
Name a nigga sharper
Next it's Sunset, Blow a dumb check
It's almost sunset, and I ain't done yet

(Verse 1)
We don't shop at Lennox, cross the street at Fifths
Rockstar my jeans, Balmain with the zips
Balmain with the pleats, Balmains with the rips
?, Can't buy at Greenbriar
Balenciaga arenas, got a rich nigga demeanor
Neck Aquafina, I'm talkin' hurricane Katrina
Yea I do this shit often, pull'n up at Slauson
Coming home flossin, Margiela walkin
Iced out my bezel, just to wave it in your face
$100 plates, that's expensive taste
Me and Ben Frank, on a dinner date
Takin shoppin sprees like I'm Ricki Lake

(Chorus)
I'm on Rodeo shoppin', Balenciaga coppin'
Nigga what's poppin? What's inside your pockets?
Just left Melrose, with 'bout 12 hoes
Bricks in elbows, and three cellphones
Flights to Bal Harbour,  Got Chanel on order
Diamonds clearer than water
Name a nigga sharper
Next it's Sunset, Blow a dumb check
It's almost sunset, and I ain't done yet

(Verse 2)
Off white my jacket, the one with the patches
All my shit classy, this some rich nigga fashion
Gold Rolly chain, my bitch in Vera Wang
Gold Rolly ring but it ain't from Johnny Dang
G-Star denim got a 45 in em
Cashmere sweater I'm flexing all winter
I just left Jeffries and blowed a bunch of fetti
Louis with spike not no damn Giuseppe
They know me by name
I should be on the wall of fame
Every time I hit Louis, I'm sippin champagne
Flash these ?,Just to be a dick
Just copped them Rick Owens and forgot my Stan Smith's

(Chorus)
I'm on Rodeo shoppin', Balenciaga coppin'
Nigga what's poppin? What's inside your pockets?
Just left Melrose, with 'bout 12 hoes
Bricks in elbows, and three cellphones
Flights to Bal Harbour,  Got Chanel on order
Diamonds clearer than water
Name a nigga sharper
Next it's Sunset, Blow a dumb check
It's almost sunset, and I ain't done yet
