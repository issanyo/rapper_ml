[Intro]
Uh, yeah

[Chorus]
Wendy's been holdin' it down for like a minute now
Mickey *Bleep* was tryna to beef, it's time to finish now
The team can handle any problem, that's all principal
You get it now, chicken shack, you actin' really wild
Quiet that down, Wendy's leave them all without a sound
This ain't no cakewalk, we run the town for many miles
This ain't no cakewalk, we run the town for many miles

[Verse 1]
Now, what's more childish than Twitter beef?
Especially when you know you really can't compete
They should rethink whatever is in that recipe
And everything I serve and kick it more than special teams
I'm Socrates 'cause all your ideas just come from me
They love Wendy's 'cause everything is so quality
Can't be no king, yo burgers ain't the finest thing
I can't believe you peasants have the audacity
You took a L the day you thought to come after me
"So what's the beef?" they threaten and now I really see
They threaten and now I really see, hah
They threaten and now I really see

[Chorus]
Wendy's been holdin' it down for like a minute now
Mickey *Bleep* was tryna to beef, it's time to finish now
The team can handle any problem, that's all principal
You get it now, chicken shack, you actin' really wild
Quiet that down, Wendy's leave them all without a sound
This ain't no cakewalk, we run the town for many miles, yeah
This ain't no cakewalk, we run the town for many miles

[Verse 2]
Now, um, the jig is up
You wanna beef with me? Then really, you pressed your luck
The problem is you didn't recognize I give no clucks
So wrap it up, turn these chickens to rubber ducks
And BK, don't think that you got away
You copied my old menu and put it out on replay
They bring it back like rebates, fresh food on your dinner plate
You killin' me smalls, okay? Uh, I'ma say it again
Don't play with me, it ain't safe, can't always have it yo way
So give it up like today and we won't have this again

[Chorus]
Wendy's been holdin' it down for like a minute now
Mickey *Bleep*, you need to stop it, boy, you finished now
The team can handle any problem, that's all principal
You get it now, chicken shack, you actin' really wild
Quiet that down, Wendy's leave them all without a sound
This ain't no cakewalk, we run the town for many miles, yeah, hah
This ain't no cakewalk, we run the town for many miles
