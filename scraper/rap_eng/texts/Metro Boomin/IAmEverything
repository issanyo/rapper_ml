Packin da mac

Back in da lack

Leavin da lack

Leanin my back, lean back

I seep thru the crack

Speakin my mind. I beez in da trap

Bees on my head, dey think it’s trap

Trapped ina trapezoid, attackin or stackin ah trance on da tracks

Slippin and spinnin, I trip of ah flat

I don’t do drugs, but hang around crack

You don’t do drugs, you bangin on wax

Waxing and taxin, ah matter of fact

Fuck u do mean, I’m goin off facts

Just tell me slow down if I’m goin to fast

Faster den most, ima balance
Been malice to niggas who won’t

Wake up da masses u niggas ain’t woke

Some niggas blood and some niggas folk

Some niggas real and some niggas told

Niggas get hot and think dey cold

Cold like my soul

I been sold my soul

My father won’t dea, my mother don’t care

Just me and brothers dat thuggin alone

Dey seen what I seen, da places I go

Da faces I show, to throw people off in case dey get close

I am ya god so give me ah toast

I am da lord I hung on the cross

I am the boss

Don’t suck my dick if you don’t suck my balls

Don’t cross me over, you can’t take loss

Attraction is law

Subtractin is key

Remove all da snakes, if it’s not what it seems

Include all ya thoughts if it’s makin relief

Creating beliefs

Dictatin the beefs, or fixatin ah meme

Cuz u know how it be, I’m controlling all things

Holdin all things in my hands, I’m supreme

Rockin supreme, bitch I said pepperoni not no supreme

Suck my ring, nodda skin will go green


Worship me, I am the person you dream

I am the everything all in one thing

I am the channeler changing the screen

Breakin the scene, from the music I bring

U influenced by me, but don’t wanna weak

You fuckin wit me den u gonna look weak

Look and I peek, goin down widows peak

I’m back at the creek, at da swamp where I sleep

I feel like shrek havin donkies wit me

Dey give me respect from the honkies wit me

I’m honking my horn, so the junkies can creep

And stop runnin in streets while I’m drivin and vibin

To something of me

You nothing to me, heard nothing of me

Ima ghost, I’m everything, stuck in deceit

The person dat tried me, stuck in deceit

Til I took out his life bein stuck ah tree

Lynchin, and pimpin
Dey lovin da scheme

Rhymin ah scheme
Time




Gimme my key, key to success
Gimme my key, and don’t gimme no sex

I only want neck
Bitches be stinkin, repeatin myself and ain’t washing up yet

Swallow my kids
And don’t lean for ya kiss

I’ll kill anybody dats word to my kids
You is my kids

God of this earth, with da devil within
God of this earth that’s the devil u bitch

God of the living and god of the dead

Anubis the name of the god of the dead

I’m funny as shit so you gotta be dead

It can’t be no love it just gotta be head

I’m sorry my shorty, to call it ah end

But u rather be suckin and fuckin, tellin niggas u love em, disgustin U kno I’m not dem

So suffer in silence and I hope u die quick no mercy for u

Cuz u tried to be slick
I am ya god Ik all ya tricks

I am the chemicals all in one cig
I am the intervals all ya head
I am the spirits dats under your bed
Dats why u feel scared, dats why u see red

And can’t sleep but instead u trapped in ya mind dats da place I intend

You don’t have the help
You don’t have ah friend

You loss in ya mess
Your thought is regret

But I won’t forget
You tried to finesse


U thought I forgave but fuck what I said
I’m never ah slave

I’m god in da flesh
Blasphemy bitch ,I’m dark, I’m possessed

Happily bitch, you can stop to exist
