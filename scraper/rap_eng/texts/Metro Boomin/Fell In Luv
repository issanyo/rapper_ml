[Hook: Future]
Young nigga he love bangin' that choppa
He don't love his ho, he love his choppa
Young nigga ain't slippin', keep that choppa
Young nigga love money, love that choppa
I fell in love wit' a choppa
Fell in love wit' a choppa
I fell in love wit' a choppa
Fell in love wit' a choppa

[Verse 1: Doe Boy]
Young'ns pullin' up and get to dumpin' nigga
Hoppin' out that foreign bitch I'm bussin' wit' 'em
He's a sweet nigga, I let that 30 kiss 'em
Can't run outta bullets, he brought them 100s wit' 'em
Not a fuck-nigga, but I'm wit' that fuck-shit
Give no fuck 'bout you or none of them niggas you run wit'
Young run shit, young dump Glocks
Mean-muggin' shoot yo' face call it mugshots
Young nigga be hidin' all them bushes, money brought you power so I took it
Love my choppa so I rob niggas
Turn down for what before you die nigga

[Verse 2: Mexico Rann]
Shit dead, I'm totin' boy, I'll bring down a helicopter
50k on my watches, 50k on my collar bone, 100k on diamonds
Know I got at least 50 rounds on me (Mexico imitates a choppa)
Boy this thing sound lovely
Send a yoppa to my head, been a whole 'nother story
I'm sleepin' wit' my stick, in the bed wit' my shit
At my trap spot, they loaded down, I at least got one stick
Got a flashlight, got the red beam, got a knife on this bitch
The way I work this yoppa, you'd think the military trained me
And if I let this thang rip, ain't nothin' gon' save ya
We choppin' all the trees, goin' through houses, even goin' through cars
Lil' broad [?] cause I'm ridin' wit' the 'K
Bitch get out my car!
