[Hook: 41 Savage]
Westley Unseld shooting and he’s flossing (flossing)
Cooking up the defense yeah he’s saucing (41 41)
Tried to guard Wes and it cost him (cost him)
Westley put his ankles in a coffin (on god)
Young Westley, man this shit so easy (woah)
Jumping so high that he’s talking to Jesus (yeah)
Westley Unseld yeah he’s wet all season (splash)
Blood so cold that it’s way below freezing (41)

[Verse 1: 41 Savage]
Got a lot of range like a private jet
35 feet and he’s still a threat
Got a triple double and dropped 45
And he did it all without breaking sweat (41)
Slicing through the defense like a samurai (slice)
Posterizing people it’s a homicide (yeah)
Plus young Westley Unseld always dropping dimes (dimes)
You can’t guard Wes please stop telling lies (41)
Westley Unseld yeah he did it all
Blocking every shot like a brick wall
Yeah he’s a center but he’s not tall
1988 he was in the hall
He’s so wet that he can never dry again (splash)
Jordan is the goat? better try again (uh huh)
Nah its not LeBron, are you high again? (what)
All the sports media telling lies again (41 41)
50% career from three, no one’s wetter (woah)
Young Westley is the goat, no one’s better
