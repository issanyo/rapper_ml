[Hook: D. Marogani] Look at that green, look at that green
Look at that green, nothing for free
Go and get the money, nigga get like me
These hoes don't love me, they love the green
(x2)

[Verse 1: D. Marogani] Bread winner, a nigga don't how to lose
Let that shit simmer, mountains we about to move
For every single penny, hold niggas accountable
Bass vibrating in the club, we pushing powder tubes
Cartel affiliated, all black like in the Matrix
New car smell everyday shit, move coke like it's still the eighties
Now a star, moved to A list, done with night, move to day shift
Game is mine, for the taking, certified, he don't fake it
Niggas know, niggas know, I don't feed a rat
Triggers blow, get exposed, nigga feast on that
Light that coke, baking soda, 'til the beaker crack
Nigga, even Stevie Wonder could see the math
Trap squad like a funeral procession
Cadillacs to lambos, studio connections
What I'm doing next, ain't even a question
I'm counting checks, you could count your blessings

[Hook: D. Marogani] Look at that green, look at that green
Look at that green, nothing for free
Go and get the money, nigga get like me
These hoes don't love me, they love the green

[Verse 2: D. Marogani] Rolling stone, making money worldwide
Bitches I don't understand, on the wood, termites
See the green, they eyes turn serpentine
Stacks got 'em all hooked, at first sight
Could make a castle out this dough
From stuffing under mattresses and broke
Use to take the ratchet and unload
Now got hitters who could put you in a casket for the low
With all this skrill, a nigga still keep it real
When I go, for my blood, I'm leaving mils
I'ma teach them niggas how to reach a deal
If they run up on you, make 'em disappear, bleach the wheel
No days off, no slacking
Police paid off, wiping records like a napkin
Specialty in trapping, streets welcome me, a captain
The celery I'm stacking, forever be lasting

[Hook: D. Marogani] Look at that green, look at that green
Look at that green, nothing for free
Go and get the money, nigga get like me
These hoes don't love me, they love the green
