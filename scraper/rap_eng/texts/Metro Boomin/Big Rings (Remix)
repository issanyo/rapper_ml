[Verse 1: Futuristic]
Yo, two rings I'm the MVP
I'm Steph Curry, all I ever do is swish my threes
My shows look like I've been livin' in DC
A whole lotta people listen when I give my speech
Like Mister King, my fit lookin' crispy clean
Smoke green now my eyes glazed, Krispy Kreme
Turn a booth into ash when I spit this heat
Your Dre Beats might melt from these MP3s, sheesh
Who would have thunk it that I would go out in public
And spit something that's disgustin' and everybody would bumb it
A nerdy dude now I'm stuntin' like Breezy I'm 'bout to run it
And these band girls all tryna blow me like a trumpet
Independent, you a puppet, the flow is like double Dutch
If you try to jump it, I promise that you gon' get hurt
Give 'em the pads, every track they be runnin' it back
And I ain't talkin' 'bout a football game, this on the turf like surf
This a free collab, my team will spaz on anything I bring in the lab
I been meanin' to ask, why are you still rappin'?
You should bag it up, you suck, you so trash
Call Devvon like, "Homie, what you want?"
What song you wanna kill today?
My flow cold but I still can't chill today
I got bills to pay
And all my haters made me feel this way
I need rings, Super Bowl size
I need a fine dime with some super cold thighs
You say you the truth, that's a Super Bowl lie
I flex on a nigga like a super swole guy
You comin' at the squad and you super gon' die
I make it look easy and I super don't try
It's funny, everybody always lookin' up to me
But I've always been a super short guy, bye

[Verse 2: Devvon Terrell]
We need some really big rings cause we royal
We kings, ain't no Presley but snipin' these beats like I'm Wesley
So please don't just test me or else you gon' let me
Hit you, you, you, you, you, you, you and your bestie
I am your father, lyin', why bother?
Kickin' you off of my cliff like Mufasa
Mufasa, Mufasa, I don't post like comments
I think they comin' for my head, roger
Enemies close and my friends are much closer
Heatin' me up and I pop like a toaster
So many things that a nigga can show you
If you were a cold then I guess I'm Ebola
Sick of these haters like what are they feedin' ya
I am the truth and you are Wikipedia
We are the bosses so they won't be needin' ya
Throw you up like futuristic beleimia
I feel like Tony Montana
Do what I want like Rihanna
I need some big rings
The shit that we makin' will make 'em complain like your honor
