(Verse 1)
I go from lookin’ through the balance sheet
To lookin’ through my thoughts for self-evaluation
I know the ins and outs, I been about those financial statements
I’ve got to prosper like proper doctors, I have the patience
That CPA in the money makin’, what a lovely fragrance
I smell like cash, I sound like cash, but cash is worthless
You’d need an audit to see inside of me, they scratch the service
You’re lookin’ at the kid that used to be nervous
But now it’s at your service for the summer, runnin’ this camp like Tony Perkis
Hold up, what you about that man wit the necktie, in NY?
And it’s funny that I’m Upstate in the state, but I’m reachin’ up high tryna start my own empire
Alright…
Half of me wanna be humble about the whole talent and skill
But then I got some devil tellin’ me I should be confident when I wreak havoc and kill
But half of me follow that budget, dough, that budget be whisperin’ that I should chill
It all began as a hobby, other half lobbyin’ like “just add to the bill.”
Ay, I aim for the head, yah
Ay, you heard what I said, yah
Ay, I’m leavin’ ‘em dead, yah (in the livin’ room?)
Ay, my budget in red, yah
Mr. Richard taught cash is king
Then I got a king’s crown with a matchin’ ring
Then I realized that I’m sittin’ in my prime
And I never did worry ‘bout packaging
Now it sounds fresh even when I’m babbling
I’m like a babbling brook with the adlibbing
Man, even my background vocals are inviting
Like, “ Ay, stay and have a drink.”
Haha
My soul is ink, horcrux - loose leaf
Generic to those who look, and I’m Tha Character for those who see
I’m out this world like blast off, I’m accountin’ for it like cash lost
Generic puts that mask on, but Tha Character takes that mask off, like…

(Interlude)
Hello, sir. It’s nice to meet you. My name’s Eric Armitage
I understand you have some job openings for a staff accountants
Whattup, it's Generic Tha Character
I’m a motherfuckin’ menace with the microphone, haha

(Verse 2)
The unwrapper, the blunt packer, the dutch master
The one that will smoke you, lap ya, then say I’m the come backer
What an unbelievable vehicle when I rip it
They told me my sickness was just untreatable at the clinic
So I’m livin’ like it’s last day, smelling like Cash Clay
When I come across, cross my fuckin’ heart like axe spray
Percussion rushin’ through my veins soon as that track play
I’m drag racin’ every path taken, in a McLaren F1
Bad marriage, meet a milf, nah, you don’t wanna step, son
They don’t really wanna see me come wreck ‘em
They know that I might be on the spectrum
They know that I got a way with the words
Blazin’ the verse, yeah the gift came wit a curse
Slangin’ the nouns, I ain’t playin’ around
I lean wit it, man I’m Lil’ Wayne wit the syrups
You don’t know how the brain works, gon’ visit yo’ brain first
They’ll brain storm while I pray for ‘em while I pop champagne corks
Celebrate me
I don’t gang bang, I don’t slang caine, I don’t aim high, I lay low
I just aim’ fo’ my Halo, that same goal since day one (Amen)
Better get yo umbrella for when that reign come, I came from
That bedroom, that bedroom was the Weapon X facility
Now look at this (ability)
I cook and it’s (blue meth)
I get in the booth and (kill a beat)
Yeah, this be what I (do best)
(I will) suplex ya whole crew next with these duplex whatchamacallits
I’ll Iguodala yo’ oblongata, I gotta hippopotamus vocabulary
Turn Bad and Boujee to Ben & Jerry’s, I’m Mad Hatter vs. adversaries
I wouldn’t be shocked if all my friends were absolutely imaginary
