[Hook]
She swear she love me, that bitch that money hungry
How could I [?] with all this money on me
I see it then I go back if I want it
Came up from nothing that's why I'm money hungry
Money hungry (x8)
All these niggas ya see with me, money hungry
I told my bitch I don't wanna eat, I'm money hungry

[Verse 1]
She swear she love me, but that bitch that money hungry
Selling p's of broccoli, got me all this macaroni
Keep my Glock concealed so please don't try to run up on me
And you know that I would die for mine like Tony Montana
[?]
Money hungry ass nothing, bitches I can't stand them
A whole fresh batch of OG, I just land them
Put 200 bands in the trap, I'm tryna get that phantom
On the road doing shows, still getting it in
Money hungry, that's why this coupe what I'm seeing in
3 houses I'm living in
Stash house no chilling in
All my niggas family that's on everything, fuck a friend

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All these niggas you see with me, they money hungry
If I fuck with her better believe she money hungry
Walk up with it, on my mind early this morning
Money hungry (x4)
Woke up feeling just like Nino Brown
Grabbed a bottle of champagne then I sprayed her down
Almost made her drown
Fucked her good, then we layed around
Money hungry like the boys in shelters, we don't want no problems
They ask me where all the money come from
I said I can show you how to get it if you want some
She loves me, she loves me not
I came up selling pot
I spoiled my bitch til she rot
So she swear she love me a lot

[Hook]
