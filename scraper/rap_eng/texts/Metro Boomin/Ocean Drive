[Intro]
21, yeah
Real street nigga
21
Know what I'm sayin'?
Young nigga done been through some shit man
Now a young nigga on top man
But I still got that Glock man
Still let that motherfucker pop man
21

[Verse 1]
See Savage he be with them apes
Play with this shit, you get ate
Bitch I be covered in Bape
Bitch I be covered in Bape
You know I keep me a K
You know I keep me a Draco
Wrap a nigga like an eggroll
Big bullets leave a big hole
I was raised by the G code
Don't bend, nigga don't fold
My uncle taught me how to scrape the bowl
And my auntie still smokin' blow
Came from nothin', nigga we was poor
Eviction notices all on the door
Take out trash for some school clothes
I'm the one that the streets choose

[Hook]
Now I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
Got my own money, pussy nigga I did not sign
Say Young Savage name in a song, it's some shots fired
I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine

[Verse 2]
I can't leave the house without my Glock nine
I can't go nowhere without my Glock nine
I'm sippin' codeine all on Ocean Drive
Poppin' percocets on Rodeo Drive
Baby roll the window up and let's get high
You ain't no real nigga if you testify
I don't have to question where my niggas ride
If you gotta question, they ain't on your side
Plenty late nights I made my mama cry
Shootouts in apartments made my mama cry
Seen my niggas in a hearse, I Stevie Wonder-ed why
Retaliation, let 'em spark like it's the Fourth July

[Hook]
Now I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
Got my own money, pussy nigga I did not sign
Say Young Savage name in a song, it's some shots fired
I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
