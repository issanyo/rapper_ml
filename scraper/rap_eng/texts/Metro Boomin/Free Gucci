[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah (Yeah!)
Metro
(Swirling cup of ice)
Yeah, Yeah, yeah
Metro Boomin want some more nigga
Hey, hey, hey

[Hook: Young Thug]
Everything Gucci, everything Gucci
Everything Gucci, bitch I'm good
Bitch I'm Blood, bitch I'm good
Bitch I'm hood
Everything Gucci, everything Gucci
Everything Gucci, everything Gucci
Bitch I'm good, bitch I'm Blood
Bitch I'm Blood, bitch I'm Blood

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Everything is Gucci, everything is Gucci
Every time I had a strap I swear I used it
Diamonds wet like her coochi
Plenty fightin' like hadoken
Bitch [?] up in the house tonight
If you don't want it left, get it right
Put another two steps with the bright
All my bitches like me, they be boolin', no dyke
Twin Turbo, made Thugga Thugga lap a nigga twice
You got 50 whole bands, got damn, want a rapper for the night
Harry Potter with a broom
Drinkin' on lean, eatin' shrooms
Ridin' 'round with Ma, no Pum'
Thugger boost, a nigga car go "zoom"
Fast mothafucka, pull up in the coupe, blowin' hash, mothafucka
50 thousand dollar dogtag, mothafucka
I wanna fuck your cat, no jag, mothafucka

[Hook: Young Thug]
Everything Gucci, everything Gucci
Everything Gucci, bitch I'm good
Bitch I'm Blood, bitch I'm good
Bitch I'm hood
Everything Gucci, everything Gucci
Everything Gucci, everything Gucci
Bitch I'm good, bitch I'm Blood
Bitch I'm Blood, bitch I'm Blood

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Blood in, blood out
Pull up, drop top Viper
Cuz in, cuz' out
Blue suit followed by a sniper
It don't matter what you bang, real niggas got stains
Phantom hoggin' two lanes, dang, dang, bang, bang
Chief Keef is my nigga, Lil Durk, my nigga
Three hundred thousand in my pocket
Got damn I got some with 'em, diamonds all in my chain
They ain't come from Johnny Dang
I might rob Johnny Dang
That's how slimin' maintains
Metro Boomin, Metro Thuggin
Nigga might get to sluggin' if he muggin'
Nigga might buy a Rollie just to flood it
Nigga got two cups and they're muddy
Drop your bitch off and fuck on her buddy
Pull it out her mouth and put it in her butt
Young bitch clean, it ain't come out muddy

[Hook: Young Thug]
Everything Gucci, everything Gucci
Everything Gucci, bitch I'm good
Bitch I'm Blood, bitch I'm good
Bitch I'm hood
Everything Gucci, everything Gucci
Everything Gucci, everything Gucci
Bitch I'm good, bitch I'm Blood
Bitch I'm Blood, bitch I'm Blood
Everything Gucci, everything Gucci
Everything Gucci, bitch I'm good
Bitch I'm Blood, bitch I'm good
Bitch I'm hood
Everything Gucci, everything Gucci
Everything Gucci, everything Gucci
Bitch I'm good, bitch I'm Blood
Bitch I'm Blood, bitch I'm Blood
