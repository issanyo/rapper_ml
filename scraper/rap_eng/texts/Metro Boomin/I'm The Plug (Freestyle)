[Verse]

This ain't neck and neck bitch I'm Chris Bosh
D Money wet em up like a car wash
Niggas lame say they dunking on the game, I just checked the basket and the shit said “Osh Kosh”
Why these niggas got opinions?
When we talk bars you ain't mentioned
Every line I'm spittin wicked
Pray to the lord I'm forgiven
Spit acid
No tab on my tongue nigga
Try to diss me then you dumb nigga
She on the trombone and I beat that like a bass drum
Stuntin like she a virgin? Well today she gonna take one
We too deep, we in all black, and I dare a nigga to say something
She bounce on the dino like a pogo
Up down, up down like a yoyo
Say they cold but they sweet call em froyo
For the bars, y'all jones like lolo
Young nigga ask your girlfriend she know
If you snitch catch stitches, no Lilo
Hot like a big nigga in a peacoat
Minions, y'all know where be though
Going crazy till I got my own Vevo
Do it for the city like I'm D Rose
Y'all Shaq, I'm Nash with the free throws
Faith game strong like I'm Tebow
Too real, I'll never break g code
I'll come for that ass like Nemo
Call 911, no Reno
Get the memo? Be like me more, damn

The city sell paraphernalia
Don't trust him he look like a squealer
You niggas is chasing them racks
Trying to get my family a billion
How much I been through you don't wanna know
Trying to count big bills, no Buffalo
Writing all this fire got my hand hot
Going out like a lame? No I cannot
Killing young men of my kind
Then y'all niggas wonder why I hate cops
Fuck nigga, no I don't feel ya
I'm fly as Amelia
It really ain't no thing, I got Dylaan B in this thing
You need a knife in your back and a bullet to the chest
And no pulse to feel my pain yeah yeah
That shit the truth
Manslaughter when I'm in the booth
I ain't trying to kick it, ain't trying to hang
Niggas fuck around try to tie my noose
Yeah yeah I got the juice yeah yeah I got the sauce
I win bitch ain't shit never dead locked
Everything I spit accurate head shot
Niggas dying on a Sunday when the lead pop
Take you out the picture, my niggas will crop it
Bitch I spit fiya, propane in my veins
All these rappers my children like Erica Kane
R.I.P SK
My loud man a ese
I do not beg not even your pardon
Got the Tommy on me, my heart Cole
Now tell me where the fuck is Martin
Let's get it

[Outro]

Ahh ahh
Thought I was done uh
My city said I'm the one uh
I body rappers for fun uh
If you the shit, I'm runs
