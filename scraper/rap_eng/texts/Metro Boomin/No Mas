[Verse 1: Don Wong]

Looking at my skin yellow as some yolk now
Copping all these watches all I rock is gold now
Popping thirty perks, watch me put in work baby (30!)
Wake up, bake up, cake up, she got make up on my shirt now

Boutta go down Walter White when I'm cooking (Cook it!)
Call me young Chillz out all night when I'm fucking
Busting, ducking all the cops when I'm running up your spot
Stop, drop it like its hot like I'm cooking in the pot, ooh

Xans make her sleep, put her deep in a coma
Thinking 'bout the pink when I'm drinking all the soda
Tell me why bitches try and get my wifi
Sipping on gin when I pull up in the driveway (Pull up!)

Making all this money wrinkle like its old now
Washing, rinsing all these singles like they growing mold now
First I copped a dell, then I bought a Mac (Mac!)
I said hello Adele, then she said it back!

[Verse 2: Geechi Jack$on]

Got this money quick, Baby line it up for me
I was cruising, I was heading all the way to downtown
I Just had some bitches and they know why I'm rocking
I just bought a couple pounds and the police tryna cop it now

All the way down to Cali, All the way down to Church
All my bitches put in work now! Ay!
Ay! Send me down to Guatemala bitch I pop a Dolla
Ay! And I don't even know what got in me

Ay! And I ain't one to fuck with 'pologies
Ay! Bitches, they all want a part of me
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ayyyyy! Ayyyyy! Uhhhhh!

First I copped all of the checks, then I cop all the dope with the money I stole
Ay call it embezzle, my watch got a bezel its ice! Thats the life that I know, yup!
I don't know where to go baby
I don't got a choice no more, no more



[Outro: Don Wong]
