Zay ~ No Sleep On The Block

Freestyle ~
It's funny I be peeping
Friends switch up like the season
No tlc yea I'm creepin
No tlc yea I'm creepin
I hold on that llama
Bullets bite like pariahs
Wash ya mouth no orthodontist
Run up a check super sonic
Deadeye to the back
Take em to zach attacks
Give em the boon running back
I know say you don't care
I know say it's unfair

Eennie Minnie mo
Catch em by his toe
Then I let him go
Warning shot first just to let him know
Magic wit big bro
An his name is glo
Ion got no friends
All I got is foes
Hash slinging slasher
Then I just might bag you
Treat you doll then I just might drag ya
We aiming for you head
Flipping like a penny



You got two sets of teeth
I ain't even joking
Pass it to my cuzzo
Then he get to poking
Go to your barber and ask for a taper
Run up to your house then I might fade ya
My goons and killers they pop out at dark
Don't ever try to diss me on 30 Glocks
Have lil tony come wit a mop
Like a new Camaros we knocking off tops
You don't know where we from
It got hot on this block
Heat on me feel like lud foe
Knock ya mama wig off wit this pole
X's over O'S No Tick Tak Toes
37 playing for ODU
Shoot him in his face til he turn blue
Heard you a rat an u talk to the Feds
Took da k out Kayla an aim fo the head
Imma get broski to flip you
And Kayla goin miss you
The bullets don't miss you
They spot on like missiles
Attention no soldiers
Poker face on me
Ion budge like a boulder
You body laid out like you doing yoga
Ya hair don't look right in the Braids& taper
You told me don't diss u
U asking for favor
You talk to more girls while you wit Kayla

We up in the street
We all on the block and
You know it's no sleep
