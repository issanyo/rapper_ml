[Intro]
Let's do it
Yeah
A hundred racks a show nigga

[Chorus]
A hundred racks in the duffel, it's time to count it up
I'm in your city just for one night, bitch I'm just tryna fuck
Put your ass on the block list after I catch my nut
Fake ass gangster made a diss song, I bet your tongue get cut
Just like a car from the Flintstones, bitch you broke as fuck
Everywhere I go the gang with me, hundred racks, no change in it
Got my aim from the range with me, thirteen with stain in it
Bentayga with no brains in it, all my hoes get the same treatment

[Verse 1]
Bitch you broke and boujee, your nigga sad and losing
I got a new Kel-Tec but I might use the Uzi
Sipping on Hi-Tech, we don't do the deuces
A hundred K each show, tell me who is losing
I got a new freak ho, she tryna do the booty
I got the pink molly in, yes I still get booted
That nigga missed all his shots, tell me who is shooting
Three stripes on my clothes bitch, yeah it's Gucci
Tom Ford lense on, I can see you chosing
She put you in the friendzone, now you looking stupid
Can't fall in love with no freak ho, bitch my name ain't Cupid
A hundred guns from the pawn shop, I can't wait to use it

[Chorus]
A hundred racks in the duffel, it's time to count it up
I'm in your city just for one night, bitch I'm just tryna fuck
Put your ass on the block list after I catch my nut
Fake ass gangster made a diss song, I bet your tongue get cut
Just like a car from the Flintstones, bitch you broke as fuck
Everywhere I go the gang with me, hundred racks, no change in it
Got my aim from the range with me, thirteen with stain in it
Bentayga with no brains in it, all my hoes get the same treatment

[Verse 2]
Dressed in Gucci, Fendi, bitch stay out my business
Last nigga tried me, I ain't leave no witness
This a real trap house, I don't take no pennies
I get a hundred pounds in like I'm LA Fitness
This a real boss plate, I don't eat at Denny's
Dope selling real good and it's finger licking
Twenty racks to my shooter, yeah, trappin' out an Uber
Fuck your gang, I rep Bermuda
Pull up wrong I just might shoot you
Big Backwoods, I don't smoke no hookahs
She ain't got no walls, I look right through her
I made her suck it up, 'til her jaws lock
After this first nut bitch you goin' on call block

[Chorus]
A hundred racks in the duffel, it's time to count it up
I'm in your city just for one night, bitch I'm just tryna fuck
Put your ass on the block list after I catch my nut
Fake ass gangster made a diss song, I bet your tongue get cut
Just like a car from the Flintstones, bitch you broke as fuck
Everywhere I go the gang with me, hundred racks, no change in it
Got my aim from the range with me, thirteen with stain in it
Bentayga with no brains in it, all my hoes get the same treatment
