[Intro]
Girl, you know what I’m saying
This beat is so, so Metro
Whatever I ask you to do, she gonna know it
Real ride or die
I’m stunning

[Hook: 1]
She fuck with me, she don’t fuck with you
She take them charges for me, if I tell her too
She fuck, she fuck, she fuck, she fuck with me
She fuck, she fuck, I know she fuck with me

[Verse 1]
Real nigga since day one
Real nigga over here, baby
A real nigga going straight South
A real nigga don't drink beer, baby
Real nigga gonna make money
Real nigga never feel that
Real nigga, I don't know you
I ain’t seen shit, and I don’t hear nothing
Pardon that and I meant that
Swerve on them in the Bentley
I see the girl coming, tell her, get back
But the 45 knock your shit back
Mid match on the perpetrator
Big gats it's a murder scene
I got another gun in my left hand
I bet a deaf man, he done heard of me
911 It's a emergency
You’re scared nigga, I’m killing these niggas
Broke in the game like a burglary
Like surgery, I’m splitting these niggas, wig up
Get rich homies, all the broke niggas gonna fear us
She done fell in love with a real nigga

[Hook: 2]
She fuck with me, she don’t fuck with you
She take them charges for me, if I tell her too
She fuck, she fuck, she fuck, she fuck with me (I know she do!)
She fuck, she fuck, she fuck, I know she fuck with me
Real niggas over here, baby
Real niggas over here
Real niggas over here, baby
Real niggas over here
Real niggas over here, baby
Real niggas over here
Real niggas over here, baby
Ain’t nothing but them niggas, over here, baby!

[Verse 2]
Rich Homie my clique, baby
So real niggas over here
A broke nigga ain’t shit, baby
So I’m trying to get over here
A hundred thousand I spent
Baby, on wardrobe this year (I did)
Real niggas are related to me
Real niggas know how I feel
And real niggas know how I live
You can ask Nard or lightpoe made a million and ain't got a deal
That features and a lot of show
I’m at the table, trying to get a mil
I already got one, but I need more
Like Ceelo, I need green
But I'm still gon be an outcast
Got a bottom grill so I talk cash
Money shit, nigga
Broke ass nigga I walk past
Yeen shit nigga
35 hoes make em call the cops
Even though that homie a rich nigga
And I got them Ms
She talk too much she told her friends

[Hook: 2]
She fuck with me, she don’t fuck with you
She take them charges for me, if I tell her too
She fuck, she fuck, she fuck, she fuck with me (I know she do!)
She fuck, she fuck, she fuck, I know she fuck with me
Real niggas over here, baby
Real niggas over here
Real niggas over here, baby
Real niggas over here
Real niggas over here, baby
Real niggas over here
Real niggas over here, baby
Ain’t nothing but them niggas, over here, baby!
