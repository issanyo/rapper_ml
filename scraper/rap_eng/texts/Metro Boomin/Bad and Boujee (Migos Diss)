[Intro: Future]
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Hook]
Raindrop, drop top
Flow is as smooth as a foxtrot
Suave on the track, what you thought, thot (thot)?
We came from striking to hitting figures
Boy I'm so hungry, I killed they snickers
Call up the clique and they rolling quicker
Laying this verse and I'm growing bigger
My clique is proud and boujee
Cooking up dope while they drooling
I stay on the job, ain't no fooling
I don't sleep, so I'm on to round two
My clique is proud and boujee
Cooking up dope while they drooling
I stay on the job, ain't no fooling
I don't sleep, so I'm on to round two

[Verse: Suave]
Suave! Whoo! whoo! whoo! whoo! whoo!
Who is that kid on the come up, you know what? It sound like he aiming at you!
I took the flow right from you, lay down your dog (pyoom!)
Taking the pound from you, taking your wings, shouldn't have flew
Wishing these rappers would come for me
Why it take three of y'all to make some cheese
Swear when y'all rap, y'all just blowing trees
Ain't no real lyrics, just quit it please
Enemigos got dinero, but really ain't getting Jack like a sparrow
If I'm a pirate, I'ma profit and make a hundred mil off your market
I got it, I got it, I got it, they want me to drop it like Trump in the office
But I'm into placing my orders and order a quarter of gorders to your quarters
I'm hot and I'm spicy, don't try me
I might have to run you out like you wifey
Service trash, like your Wi-Fi
Need to keep watch since you icy
Yeah, that way, I'm from the South, yeah that way
Yeah, that way, I used to trap out my closet
Yeah, that way, I do not comprehend naysay
Yeah, that way, these little boys can't say nothing, aye!

[Hook]
Raindrop, drop top
Flow is as smooth as a foxtrot
Suave on the track, what you thought, thot (thot)?
We came from striking to hitting figures
Boy I'm so hungry, I killed they snickers
Call up the clique and they rolling quicker
Laying this verse and I'm growing bigger
My clique is proud and boujee
Cooking up dope while they drooling
I stay on the job, ain't no fooling
I don't sleep, so I'm on to round two
My clique is proud and boujee
Cooking up dope while they drooling
I stay on the job, ain't no fooling
I don't sleep, so I'm on to round two
