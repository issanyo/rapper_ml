[Intro]
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up
Turn up, (Squad), turn up, (Squad)

[Hook]
They like "Damn Sosa, where you fit that cash at?"
Throwin' all this cash up, bitch, you can have that
Don't try and grab that, this pistol I'mma blast that
I heard you got a hard head, shootin' where your ass at
I get that cash back, it's just like it's elastic
I'm a rich nigga, no pops, you a broke bastard
On Instagram, I make niggas imagine
How they be like Chief Sosa, "Where he get that cash at?"

[Verse 1
I smoke dope, Tadoe on molly water
Watch got my wrist going like, I be whipping yola
Bitch I'm Almighty Sosa
Stand up to 3 double O and you gon' get slumped over
Boy you ain't no blower
You's a bitch nigga an boy you ain't no Soulja
Boy you ain't cashing, I took a hundred thousand dollars and I dragged it
On Instagram I make niggas imagine
"Where you get that watch at?", that bitch so dramatic
Cuz I be on my cash shit
Probably that's the reason why them bitch act so dramatic
Cuz you ain't gettin'g cash bitch
You need to go and get some money, and make it a habit
