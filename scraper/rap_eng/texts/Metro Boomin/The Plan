(Chorus:Yamine)
Oop. yeah the plan
Yup yeah the plan
Yes that’s the plan
Nope that’s the plan
Yeah it’s the plan
Gosh it’s the plan
Yes I got a plan
And it’s the plan (repeat)

(Verse 1: Yamine)
Yes, the plan
And the fans
No more money
It's in the trash can
When you broke
You bleed in advance
When you smoke
You float up in that van
I've been sipping and dripping
Then mixing that Sprite
Half pint of lean with  purple just right
Fucking with me you niggas gone see light
I don't come in the day, I travel at night
Yamine equals codeine
And BJ equals no freeze
I've been in and out of the A
But in Indiana they don't like the Hayes
Look at her Glaze
Look at the phrase
No more money matching with that phase
Body shifting, I'm just shitting
Fucking bitches, giving snitches stitches
I don't give a damn tattle tale and get into them ditches
While my niggas beat you down, I'm counting my digits

(Chorus: Yamine)
Oop. yeah the plan
Yup yeah the plan
Yes that’s the plan
Nope that’s the plan
Yeah it’s the plan
Gosh it’s the plan
Yes I got a plan
And it’s the plan (repeat)

(Verse 2: Yamine)
Yeah that’s the plan
98 Lakers, I’m a fan
These bitches call me a man
Gu-damn I am the man
Yamine got them bandz
I’m stupid rich and got the friends
Mess with me you get these hands
I don’t care about the fans
Fuck with me we’ll strike you down
I have the paper on the table and then map it out
I catch them snitches
And give them stitches
After I’m done with them I’d take they bitches
If you do it again I’ll put you in the ditches
I’m cooking in the kitchen
Watch me whip it and do the the dishes
I don’t care I’m just fishing
The pussy is waiting and getting tickets
You know that I am in AT&T and I don’t fuck with crickets
The service is so damn bad I call those niggas suspicious
This rap song is a rap song
I don’t care if I sing long
I know I’m at the studio
I got the plan mapped out at my home
Watch that girl get boned
She ain’t got no phone
She says “if you ain’t talking bout money then please leave me alone”

(Chorus: Yamine)
Oop. yeah the plan
Yup yeah the plan
Yes that’s the plan
Nope that’s the plan
Yeah it’s the plan
Gosh it’s the plan
Yes I got a plan
And it’s the plan (repeat)
