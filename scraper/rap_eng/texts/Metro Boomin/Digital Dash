I came from nothing still nothing
Send me a Snapchat or something
Whole life be bumping
The way that I kill em it's nothing
Man all of these joints I be tucking
I Told em I'll kill em all summer
We almost done with the summer
But I'm still killing the summer
To imma carry that until the fall
I don't fuck with them at all
I just smoke then swisher sweats
Parm said nothings fucking free
I supply my buyers
Srk
You can hear the tires
Just got that line up
Round booties I admire
All of these niggas is trash
Hand on the wheel and then hand on her ass
Redder the light maybe skip in her pants
She wearing my shirt and ain't giving it back
Pour out a lot if we talking bout hats
I'm killing this shit man
You shouldn't even asked
Hair nappy I'm Hebrew
Gold medal like eagles
He smoke like he snoop
Slept on the flow tho too
Blanket I'm cold tho too
My name in they mouth like a tooth
Man say it bout Jaden tho too
Say it bout bino tho too
High in the basement the booth
How bout you worry bout you
I don't do hooks like at all
The distance from ceiling the floor
Rolling them papers that's Raws
Nakamur ya Jaw
Glossy ass digital dash
Side panel that's cash
Sawbuck that's gas
Kings in between my past
That's what my momma them told me
That's what my dad them said
So I can't work for the man
Too used to not giving a damn
Yeezys ain't been nothing nice
Loaded no rolls no dice
Whiskey that's poured on ice
Nigga control the mic
Mike like the year I was born
Nigga I'm harder than porn
I only eating my corn
With mayonnaise and Chile
They loving the word play
I'm rolling to Thursday
Like truckers on Wednesday
She crazy like Lindsay
This flamb√© s amazing
Flow is so changing
Like rooms at Macy's
Or Chicago tastings
But taste is a sense that they lack
Cause donald controlling the map
If we building a wall
Hows it help at all
All we gotta do is ball
Circulate the money aye
Increase the middle class
Decrease they bougee asses
Help the money last
I can go on days with this
My uncle done changed the whip
Used to have stars on the roof
Now the interior blue
Naw the interiors white
Blue cause it's lit the light
Or purple don't worry the shit is nice
They should put me on funk I'll flex
Nigga i want the check
I don't take disrespect
And I got bars on deck
I'm venomous I rattle
Why they smoking weed in Seattle
If older women are cougars
Do that make fat women like cattle?
Is it wrong if a six year old takes a gym
And I initiate a battle?
If their friends are there to see
Do I crush bout Two or three
There ain't nothing wrong with me
These niggas disturbing me
This hotter than mercury
Dressed in all white like totally
Over me
I came and I destroyed this beat
So whenever you hear this ish
You only go think of me
I wonder what my kids will see
When they finally google me
I hope it ain't bad
My material ain't dad
Shit ain't even boyfriend
Where is your voice man
Were looking at apple orchards
While drinking angry orchard
I want you to know yourself
Intrests and limits
I want them to expand their wealth
Increasing your living
I want you to go on Vacay
Man fuck what they say
They don't contribute anyway
Chief keef say bang bang
Sometimes u gotta switch lanes
So
So switch mane
