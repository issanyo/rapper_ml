[Verse 1]
Girl you doing it again (we always fighting)
Why you going through my phone (What is you finding)
Tell me what is in your head (What is you hiding)
If you don't tell me and why we gon' last for long (long)
(We always fighting)
Why you doing this to me (You are so childish)
Caught me backing on the wall (we're in a sacrate)
Telling me you wanna leave and that you blame me (no, no, no, no)
(We always fighting)
How could you blame me (This always happens)
When you never talk to me (You always hiding)
And now you wanna leave and let you blame me

[Chorus]
When you're the only one that makes my world go around
When you're the only one that makes my world go around
When you're the only one that makes my world go around
When you're the only one that makes my world go around
When you're the only one that makes my world go around
When you're the only one that makes my world go around
When you're the only one that makes my world go around
When you're the only one that makes my world go around

[Verse]
Girl you're doing it again (we always fighting)

Why are you doing this to me (You are so childish)
Caught me backing on the wall (we're in a sacrate)

[Chorus]
When you're the only one that makes my world go around
When you're the only one that makes my world go around

When you're the only one that makes my world go around
When you're the only one that makes my world go around

[Bridge]
One that makes my world go
One that makes my world go
No oh oh oh, no oh oh oh
No oh oh oh, no oh oh oh
No oh oh oh, no oh oh oh
No oh oh oh, no oh oh oh
No oh oh oh, no oh oh oh
No oh oh oh, no oh oh oh

[Outro]
When you're the only one that makes my world go around
When you're the only one that makes my world go around
When you're the only one that makes my world go around
When you're the only one that makes my world go around
