(CHORUS)
Thought i wanted love but i don't know no more
Thought she loved me but i don’t know no more
Watching her leave, walking out that door
Yeah
Thought i wanted love but i don't know no more
Thought she loved me but i don't know no more
Watching her leave, walking out that door

(VERSE)
After all the time i gave you, you left without a trace
I guess that’s what i get for giving all my faith
To a stupid lil' whore, just another dumb mistake
I've been knocking door to door, tryna find what i misplaced
I've been wasting all my love
It's a shame i sealed
Now i'm taking these drugs
To numb the pain i feel
My heart is guarded up
Like the navy seals
I think my time is coming up
I popped eighteen pills
Yeah
Rather be dead
Then to deal with this pain in my chest
Pray to God this my final breath
Oh God, is it over yet?

(CHORUS)
Thought i wanted love but i don't know no more
Thought she loved me but i don't know no more
Watching her leave, walking out that door
Yeah
Thought i wanted love but i don’t know no more
Thought she loved me but i don’t know no more
Watching her leave, walking out that door

(VERSE 2)
I'm not the one to burn bridges
But you burned it to dust
I’m not the one to trust bitches
That's the lesson I've learned
Threw my heart into the ditches
And you left it to rot
Threw my heart into a casket
Sent it off in a hearse
Yeah
I pop pills til' it don’t hurt no more
I take drugs but they don't work no more
I hate love, but i don't know for sure

(CHORUS)
Thought i wanted love but i don't know no more
Thought she loved me but i don't know no more
Watching her leave, walking out that door
Yeah
Thought i wanted love but i don't know no more
Thought she loved me but i don't know no more
Watching her leave, walking out that door
