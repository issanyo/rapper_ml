Niggas really minuscule
I been really in the school
In to schooling niggas
That interrupt in my interlude
You say you be rapping but you been
Singing a dinner tune
In a loop that’ll really get you splashing, gasping, asking
In the pool with no inner tube
I’m an exotic, project, I belong in a zoo
Onyx tonic, nodding off gin and juice
Chronic, phonics, got me hot 10 to 2
Not a body, nobody can fuck with you
When you been, through what I been though
I’m giving you, knowledge, knocking noggins, nauseous nonsense not the problem
Fuck your nine to five, get out the house and solve it
You are now involved in
Something defunct, but fuck it, it’s still evolving
It’s a lot of niggas out here fronting and frauding
Doesn’t matter to me ima dead em regardless
I’m the veteran artist, ima get it the farthest
If I leave my baby, I’ll be back in the morning
Ima do my thing, give a fuck what you call me
Have a check if you call me, gotta get the Ferrari
Gotta get the Grammy, give a fuck bout a party
Shout to that nigga Arty, you should really support me
I’m a loyal subordinate, Jesus is born again
All my in my bag, I’m backing out the driveway
Back to back, I’m blacking out the tri state
Pack the strap, I’m blasting at your mind, hey
I don’t give a fuck about your neck chain
This is Bentely a.k.a The next wave
Excellence looks best in dark colors
They won’t stop till they kill all of us
Reparations paid to all brothers
They won’t stop till they kill all of us

Who the fuck they gon compare me to?
Come this way, I just might bury you
They don’t wanna the revenue
All my niggas need a better view
She been saying it’s a secret thang
Who the fuck we gon tell it to?
I want a part in like everything
This is a side of Chris you never knew
