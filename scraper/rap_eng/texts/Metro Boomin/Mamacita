[Intro: Travis Scott]
Mamacita, cita, cita
Mamacita, cita, cita

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
This the last days to the rodeo, last night
Had me down in the back, comatose, don't think
Sun shades and a pill gon' help
Once I'm gone, can't tame myself (myself, myself)
Mamacita, cita, cita
You know I really need yah, need yah, need yah right now
She get freaky when the light's down
The shit's crack, no way niggas could pipe down
With the head first, got her straight out of the night gown
Nothin' like the light-skinned mamacitas in H-Town
They got them pornstar big booties
Let me film it, then shoot it
3-D money, no illusion
Depending if I'm feelin' bougie
Might hit your line, bitch

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan & Travis Scott]
Had to cut my phone off, bitch got it vibratin' on me like a beeper
Boy, I'm in Colorado, smokin' California reefer
Hey, the bitch so bad, caught a ticket cause I really wanna meet her
And I ain't kin to Wayne but that's my mamacita
Mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
Mamacita, cita, cita
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
Mamacita, cita, cita
That my, that my, mamacita, that my, that my mamacita, that my

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Mothafuckin girl
I love her, I'mma give her the world
Aye, fuck her, I wanna fuck her mother
I just might give her my little girl
No, no, I won't let go, bro, bad ho
She look the best with a fro, natural nat-nat on go
Damn, Quan, turn on the stove, whip it 'til I have a stroke
I do not fuck with America, I get it straight off the boat
Oh, damn, the kush it never make me choke
Slow down, I'm speedin' and I got a trunk full of wham
Damn, 25 thousand on an old school Cam
SS me, these bitches wan' molest me
Damn, they'll sex me, she a lesbian
She want chicken like sesame
And she tryin' to undress me, test me
Give her hotel keys like Cassidy, you dig?

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan & Travis Scott]
Had to cut my phone off, bitch got it vibratin' on me like a beeper (Brrr)
Boy, I'm in Colorado, smokin' California reefer
Hey, the bitch so bad, caught a ticket cause I really wanna meet her (really wanna meet her, wanna meet her)
And I ain't kin to Wayne but that's my mamacita (mamacita, mamacita)
Mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
Mamacita, cita, cita
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
Mamacita, cita, cita
That my, that my, mamacita, that my, that my mamacita, that my

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
Bad little college ho that I got on the east skirts of Decatur
Best believe that she cover Rich Homie Quan like a blazer
I smoke a lot of weed, keep my music turned up, fuck my neighbors
I fuck a nigga bitch and turn her like a table
Ayy, I’m still practicin' so you know I’m gettin' greater (swear to god)
Ayy, still wearin' long socks and shorts like Fabo
He was hatin' at first, now he tryna make the payroll
Got a stupid bitch who do whatever I say so
Money on your head like a Jesus piece (what?)
Blunt, now I'm higher than Khalifa be
Bad bitch lookin' like a Filipina (damn)
Ohh, you're killin' me, ohh, remember me
You, finna be, deceased if you keep callin' me
Therefore I

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan & Travis Scott]
Had to cut my phone off, bitch got it vibratin' on me like a beeper
Boy I'm in Colorado, smokin' California reefer
Hey, the bitch so bad, caught a ticket cause I really wanna meet her
And I ain't kin to Wayne but that's my mamacita
Mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
Mamacita, cita, cita
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
Mamacita, cita, cita
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
