[Verse 1: SD]
Lately I've been feeling like the President, what's got into me?
Focus on this money, basic shit, astrology
Too much shit don't bother
But too much, it just fuck with me
Damn baby honestly, girl you could be more promising
She can't get back, she a freak
Standing tall, know how I get
She want that all night dick
I get them loose knots quick
Don't fall, move still until you get [?]
Just that mood I get
Girl ain't really too much nothing multiply like this
Feeling a little funny, don't you snooze might trip
Ball hog, watch me tip

[Bridge x2]
Feeling a little funny yea

[Verse 2: SD]
Lets get back to the sense
Boss made, you can't forget I made myself get rich
They say I'm smooth, I admit
Cause I be chilling and counting bucks, I'm on my [?] shit
I used to feel hood sick, until them dollars piled up and made my whole world clear
Feeling a little froggy, don't fall or trip
Cause it was easy enough to clap em, when you fall don't trip
