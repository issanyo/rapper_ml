[Intro]
Aye
This some real la familia shit ya nah mean
We pass that shit
Yeah we pass the bullshit
Money on top of money nigga, the conversation
Everything's dollar signs
Extravagant lifestyle

[Hook]
I got bad bitches, bitch so bad
She harder than a dime
Finna drop the deuce in fo
Try to scratch a hard nine
If you trying to find these shoes
They gonn be hard for you to find
Rocking presidential rollies, it ain't hard to tell time
I had my ups, I had my downs
In my lifetime, committing crimes
I'm chasing paper everyday
And it ain't hard to see I grind
I'm turning up, I'm turning up
It's gonna be hard to turn me down
I'm a motherfuckin star and it ain't hard for me to shine (straight up)

[Verse 1]
Papi got dem packs he bout to turn up with dem bands
Catch some diamonds in your face, if you look over he ain't glance
100 racks in all hundreds, tryna stuff em in my pants
I'mma make a movie on you, any time I get a chance
She gonn smash the crew and I don't have to give her no advance
Just to be in Future presence, she do everything I'm sayin
She love the kid, I swear this girl my biggest fan
I does it big, I take the gwap and make a fan (let's turn up)
I'm in your city with them real niggas whipping work up
I'm gnarly and I'da call me a wave, surfer
I'm solar system high, you know I'm faded, off purple
My shoe game killin these niggas, murder

[Hook]
I got bad bitches, bitch so bad
She harder than a dime
Finna drop the deuce in fo
Try to scratch a hard nine
If you trying to find these shoes
They gonn be hard for you to find
Rocking presidential rollies, it ain't hard to tell time
I had my ups, I had my downs
In my lifetime, committing crimes
I'm chasing paper everyday
And it ain't hard to see I grind
I'm turning up, I'm turning up
It's gonna be hard to turn me down
I'm a motherfuckin star and it ain't hard for me to shine (straight up)

[Verse 2]
They say I'm screwed up, and I've been leanin all weekend
With yo girlfriend, loving the crew, The Weeknd
The new Giuseppe's, I had to purchase by the bundle
Them presidential Benz's, you can tell I'm doing numbers
They jocked a nigga style and they had turned me to a monster
I was swaggign to the max, I had to turn it to some commas
It fucked wit me a second, got it right back out the jungle
I'm eatin five-star dinners, living like my nigga Stunna
Get some cash nigga, get some fetti get some lumber
Make it rain money, make it hurricane, thunder
Running to the check, while the check steady coming
I ain't gotta flex, cause I'm really getting money

[Hook]
I got bad bitches, bitch so bad
She harder than a dime
Finna drop the deuce in fo
Try to scratch a hard nine
If you trying to find these shoes
They gonn be hard for you to find
Rocking presidential rollies, it ain't hard to tell time
I had my ups, I had my downs
In my lifetime, committing crimes
I'm chasing paper everyday
And it ain't hard to see I grind
I'm turning up, I'm turning up
It's gonna be hard to turn me down
I'm a motherfuckin star and it ain't hard for me to shine (straight up)
