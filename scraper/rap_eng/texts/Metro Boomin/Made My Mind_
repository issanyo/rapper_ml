[Snippet]
These fuckboys jealous, so jealous, they wanna kill me
Feel like 2Pac when I'm riding through the west-side of my city
That bitch look like a snake, I don't want her near me
'Member back when that bitch didn't wanna hear me
I've been geekin', I've been smokin', I've been pourin' up
I've been poppin' pills, drinkin', I've been throwin' up
I'm so focused ...
