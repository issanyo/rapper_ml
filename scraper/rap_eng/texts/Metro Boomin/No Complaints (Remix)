[Intro]
Yea
Crvddyteam Shit

Blue Benjis on 250 man

[Verse]
Ain’t no complaints, I can’t complain
Racks in the
Racks in the safe
Russian cream in my lap I smoke gas everyday
Man I laugh to the bank and these niggas goin hate
I can’t trip over that. You get hit over that
Niggas goin talk cause they bitches at
I heard all the chatter I never been licked
My niggas gorillas. Bananas they clip
I ride in the coupe as a passenger (Skrrt)
My diamonds, they foreign, from Africa
Your bitch in my crib acting passionate
And we smoking zips of the cannibas
She loud as a bitch like an ambulance
She ride that dick like it’s magical
She couldn’t ride in the Acura
I ain’t even fuck cause her ass wasn’t fat enough

Yea

Shooting shit up like a pair of dice
Living life, nigga this paradise
These niggas be rats
Mickey and Minnie
A pair of mice
Parasites
Sacrifice

It don’t get better than this (Nope)
I’m living better than them (Yup)
I spin a Benz with some twins
Man I only count Ms with no dividend
If it don’t add up then shit gotta end
Patek on my wrist , I just got frost bite
Steak on my plate , I lost my appetite

I’m living well and I’m counting blessings
I couldn’t tell that a nigga keep spending
My pockets too deep. I Ain’t touching my checkings
I’m putting the pressure , they sweating
These niggas is sad and pathetic
These bitches is wack and depressing

Please do not count on no wedding
I learned my lesson
Let me make a confession
I want the dollars and y’all do the flexing
Y’all can impress them
At the end of the day who going press me
Red bottoms, I’m stepping, I’m making messes
When y’all gonna catch up? My nigga
Aye
Tommy. My Hilifigure
I want six figures
I doubled that
I didn’t figure or picture that this could go happen
Disciple of God I knew it could happen
I look to the right and I’m dabbin
Look to the left I keep stacking
Bitches throw ass then I’m catching

Pussy , Money , Weed
I’m living. I look to God for forgiveness (yea)
Pussy , Money , Weed
I’m living. I look to God for forgiveness (yea)
