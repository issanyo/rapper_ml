[Hook x2]
I'm peepin' through your window
Took out all your kinfolk
Now I'm fucking coming
To put you in a body bag

[Verse 1]
Young Metro didn't trust you, hell I shouldn't have either
Skip straight into the shooting, better pray I don't see you
Fuck a desert, but I'mma make you fly like an eagle
Splatter your brain stem, die like seagull
I'm coming through you're lobby
Two guards get shot simultaneously and nobody can stop me
Bodies fall as they pulling out Uzis to shoot me
The only shooting gonna be done is through the cameras like a movie
Kicking through like I'm Bruce Lee, giving you fuckers loose knees
They see me kill, they see me kill
They got snipers aiming right to the windowsill
So when I come up the elevator
I'm going to hell sooner or later
But I'm not stopping until I get my target
My battle experience has made hardened
I dive down the hallway, the shot missed
I make another break and then the shot hit
I'm not bleeding but the man down the hall
Federal badge and all, just came back from the mall
Oh shit, friendly fire; I make my way up the staircase
Sneaking up to the 45th floor, I see a man's face
They cooking bass when they see me peepin' through
Motherfuckers will run when they seeing you
So I pull out my pistol, shots through the window nine times
The lab explodes, kills a couple, air in the poison cyanide
Hit another container and now the shit is going through the house
Put on a gas mask, find another guy, put a gun into his mouth
Bullet exits the chamber, passes through the back
And into the bathroom where another fed blew his sack
Feds cooking drugs? Oh shit the irony
The same crooked motherfuckers try to bring everyone down besides me
I break down the door and out right to the outside
I see the slimy motherfucker, I wanna shoot out his eyes
And just when he turn around, I look around and see
Twelve cold motherfuckers with pistols and carbines

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Ain't no turning back
My soul is turning black
I'm a cold motherfucker
And it's time to face my wrath

[Verse 2]
They tried to graze with macs, but I ain't dying
I'mma kill all of these mothafuckas, I ain't lying
I dove to the left with no single breath
I shot two of them in the chest like a punch from Five finger death
I put another one inside a guy who fell off of the railing
Into the pool his body twitching and his lungs are failing
Now I ran out of bullets but I dodge a couple more
I search a dead body and I found a forty four
Only got three shots in the cylinder, gotta make it count
So I hit a propane tank, and there was a large amount
One guy fell off the roof and splattered on cars below
Caused a traffic jam all night, I'm out for revenge, only takes a scar to know
The other two shots go for another guy but it missed
I threw it at him, hit his nose, and he got really pissed
He came close to see if he could get one in my face
But I grabbed him and then stabbed him and put him in his place
Now I got a shotty, and a couple of dead fucking bodies
I got eight more people and my aim is kinda spotty
So I inch closer and dive to the other side
Then I heard mother's cries, a bullet wound through my brother's eyes
"Fuck no" I yelled and I ran straight out, looking like Commando
Every single bullet missed, made me feel like Marlon Brando
I put all of the shots in about three other guards
There's still five more, they trying to rip me apart
The sniper came in, he shot but he missed
He hit someone else, in the head and in the wrist
So that's four more people, including the traitor
At this point I'm like Jason, he better run like the Pacers
I run back inside, bullets hitting the door
Knocked it across the room, glass shards all over the house
Looked in the closet, looked like a hunting rifle
Now the hunter became the hunted, cause I'm gonna snipe you
I hit him in the arm and it took it all off
Now he sitting there and bleeding cause he just took a loss
Now there's three more, one come in the room
Throw the gun at him, grab his pistol and then boom
The traitor and his last guard running right up to the top
Shot the guard right in his back, I smiled as he dropped
Climbed up quickly, shot the snitch right in both hands
I walked closer, told him what he did was low man
I hope he made peace with god, if not he better patch it up
Paramedics won't save you, when I'm done you will not last enough

[Outro: Kane, Sounds, (Cops), Reporter]
Goodbye
Gunshot
Sounds of the traitor's body hitting the pavement
(Freeze motherfucker
I don't think he's freezing
Oh shit is that a gun?!!)
Plethora of gun shots
Body hits the ground
(I think we got him)
Earlier this morning the cops shot Kane, a man not only to have been suspected in racketeering, drug distribution, gambling, and other crimes; was also arrested and sent to prison for the robbery of a Bank of America earlier this year, as well as breaking out of the prison. The suspect entered the victim's apartment and was suspected by police to have killed over twenty bodyguards of the man, who was also suspected to be a police informant. He was shot by police officers in an apparent suicide by cop and is now being sent to the hospital, although there is a strong chance he won't make it. In other news: Nas Escobar, another crime lord, has passed away peacefully this evening, his legacy is survived by his daughter and two ex-wives. That is all for news right now, back to Madison for the weather...
