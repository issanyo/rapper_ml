[Verse]
This one for them niggas that be out here tryna cheat you
Get yo' ass back, dog, nah I ain't tryna feed you
Where yo ass was at, when I had one foot in the grave
Where yo ass was at, they held the heater to my face
Where yo ass was at, when I got held up at the club
Where yo ass was at, when all these hoes ain’t show me love
I’m just tryna make this money, nigga, do it my way
Now I got these haters out here sitting in my driveway
Niggas switching up, but then they do it on the low
Tryna give you dap, and then he tryna fuck your hoe
Then they reminiscing and they trying to remind
I don't give a fuck, these fake ass friends ain’t hard to find
You around, when I share slices of this cake
Where yo ass was at, cause now you looking twice as fake
Where the cash is at, my niggas that is where I’m going
Port is where its at, and you can see my city glowing
Man I grew up in the hollow
Where yo ass was at, when all these people didn’t follow
Where yo ass was at, when niggas tried let the gun off
I ain’t tryna fuck with you my nigga, man, I’m done off
Ever since I cut off from you niggas now I’m greedy
Old bitch want some pockets now, why the fuck you leave me?
If you want some love, then back then you should have stayed
Get yo ass back bitch, hands up off my plate
Where yo ass was at when my city turned against me
Where yo ass was at when the circle tried to bench me
Where yo ass was at all this weight up on my shoulders
Where yo ass was at when my life was like a coaster
But fuck it, I don’t need no help
Cause nigga all it takes, a single waist to hold the belt
Where yo ass was at, when I was rapping as a young one
Now the city’s hottest, you like where this nigga come from?
