[Hook: Gucci Mane]
It's time to get paid, time to get it in
Call you when they come in, time to get it in
Once you in, ain't no gettin' out, blood in
Cleanin', gassin', leanin'
It's time to get paid, time to get it in
Call you when they come in, time to get it in
Once you in, ain't no gettin' out, blood in
Cleanin', gassin', leanin'


[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci in this bitch, I'm goin' in
At least a fifty on me ten times out the ten
Street nigga ballin' like an athlete when it's in
Got them new Jordans on and I'm not even playing
On Glenwood got that trap on that dead end
Burglar barred door, lock and the chain
This shit so crazy, you can't even trust yo friends
Yo girl fuckin' yo right hand man, you in the pen
These ho's tryna know what kind of car you in
Designer batch, you wanna keep her with a friend
I have been married, she divorced me in the end
Dividends, even I keep 'em, but it's what it spends

[Hook]
It's time to get paid, time to get it in
Call you when they come in, time to get it in
Once you in, ain't no gettin' out, blood in
Cleanin', gassin', leanin'
It's time to get paid, time to get it in
Call you when they come in, time to get it in
Once you in, ain't no gettin' out, blood in
Cleanin', gassin', leanin'


[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
If ye ask me what I be jiggin', it may be Blue Benji
OG gangbang, walk up in the spot
Purge a nigga, don't flinch, 4-48 on the beach
My uncle done dimmer the tilter
I got the formula, like a professor
Hit it with the 'beat it, beat it, beat it'
Ain't BG anybody get it
Blood in with the dirty stick
When I stick it in, you gon' feel it
Word to my uncle Willy
Stockin' chickens in the Philly
This the reason why a nigga did it
Loaded bank, tattered instant cheat it
Got a cheaper ticket in the ceiling
Killin' it, cough for an instant
Guwop doin' time for swervin' his Bentley
Servin' Bobby Brown and Whitney
Double cohlene in my keith
People still trippin', hangin' in the kitchen
Fuckin' on lebete bitch, Longway, bitch

[Hook]
It's time to get paid, time to get it in
Call you when they come in, time to get it in
Once you in, ain't no gettin' out, blood in
Cleanin', gassin', leanin'
It's time to get paid, time to get it in
Call you when they come in, time to get it in
Once you in, ain't no gettin' out, blood in
Cleanin', gassin', leanin'
