[Part I: Ok]

Trav tell 'em what it is

[Chorus: Travis Scott & ScHoolboy Q]
Okay, okay, okay

Four ways, now it's time to pay
Need my money now, not tomorrow, need that shit today
Okay, okay, okay, okay

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q & Travis Scott]
Bottom bitch say ho!
Know you on top when the top get floored
Crib where the cop won't go
Rollie on bling bling, neck on ice
Tell a bitch get right, make a nigga miss that flight
Can a nigga hit that twice
Should have never let us niggas in
Got my first M 2012
Now a hundred K in the mail
Free another homie on bail
Money low her pussy gon' sell
Tryna tell me money ain't shit
When you tried to tell me water won't whip
When you tried to say this quarter won't flip
Since Snoop who the other rich crip
How Groovy get the Pringle man chip
Walk on with a twenty yard clip
Walk on while a real nigga limp
Black nigga green grass no golf
So on turn the satellite off from the set
Feel like I died on that cross hang on

[Chorus: Travis Scott & ScHoolboy Q]
Okay, okay, okay
Already know it's gon' be alright
Way we going up we might be all night
Okay, okay
Now we gon' blow like the wind
Should have never let us niggas in
Okay, okay, okay
Should have never let them niggas in
Should have never, should have never let them niggas in
Should have never let them niggas in
Sh-sh-should have never let us niggas in
Should have never let us niggas in
Sh-sh-should have never let us niggas in
Okay, okay

Alright, alright, alright
Balling down the corner
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Take the long way home
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Jacques was born April 30 aye
Doctor said he won't be home in thirty days
He gon' be alright, alright, alright, alright
Momma said her son gon' be a gift
Momma said her son gon' be the shit
He gon' be alright, alright, alright, alright

Will it be alright, alright, alright, alright?
Feel like I'mma need me a sip
Feel like I'mma need me a bitch
Make me feel alright, alright, alright, alright

[Outro: SZA & Travis Scott]
There's blood on your face
Uhh, salt on your skin
Your battle is done for now
Alright, alright, alright
Now I wanna, wanna blow these trees alright
Hit another lick and we gon' be alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Now we got this breeze, we gon' be alright
Hundred all we need, we gon' be alright
Alright, alright, alright
Completely available to you
Scrape a little off the top
Come, make your pudding pop
Alright all night
