[Intro: Gak]

Free bdp, free gak, free everybody man fuck this shit man fuck it

[Verse 1: Gak]

I'm out here gettin hoes but I'm nothing to a scholar
I might be gettin bands but I can't afford to get some college
I'm funny but I'm awkward
Got a side chick and baby mama
I'm monster
It's often, I'm off with
The chick you came in with
Give two shits
A rude bitch
Gets no dick, I'm stupid
I'm so slick, that's one k
Not 2 k's
I'm ballin, it's 2k
Cops caught be with 2 k's
That's kilo's
A hero
I'm zero
If you add about a hunnid
It's nothing
I'm out here cougar hunting
Something of a something
I'm bluffing, too real
Stunting, on two wheels
Crip walking, blood nation
The fuck am I sayin
You hatin
You looking something like a rapist
It's Gucci it's prada
No flip flops that's nada
It's akwa it's wahta
Hoes be calling me Big Poppa
When it comes to this rapping, I'm MVP
Cuz I got Jersey on my back like I'm playing for the team
Permanent word smith
Pass me a virgin
I am not allergic
She in the cut
I'm licking her butt
Not licking her but
I am giving her bud
I am the plug
Love it or not
I am a God
Do not look down cuz I am above
Hunnids of doves
We in the dub
Ballin like Munga
Fuck spittin fire I spit that thunder
Gak in this shit
Back in this shit
I'm ill and I'm spazzing
Unlike these lames I don't need a grill to go platinum
How could they fathom
The whitest kid rappin
The only one killing, any one after
Only logical answer
Man he must be cheatin, this is not fair
How's he so good, how'd he get there
I made the recipe
Nobody next to me
I do not cheat, I been accused
Where dey at now, I'm buying shoes
Lambo's and bitches and plenty of jewels
My opponents don't prosper, they cannot move
This rap game on lock, dub in control
I live it, I love it, so fuck it let's go

[Verse 2: BDP]

OI GAK YOU FAGGOT CUUUUUNT

[Verse 3: Leanzus]

I eat the ho ass then count me some cash
We doing it fast
We do it like flash
Got sum crazy ass whites that'll kill you on sight
It's like an ar 16 when i spit a 16
My boys will kill anything from 6 ta 16
My girl a dick fiend
I bring the fixing
Gak do the mixing i do the spitting
Run up on ya grams while she knitting
Or ya wife on the toilet shitting
Since birth we been sinning
But look at the scoreboard still winning
It's halftime gotta have mine
Wine and dine bitch give einestine
Run up on ya rob ya cryme time
Got cash gotta incline mine
We fuck fine dimes this the high times

[Verse 4: Unfk]

Bullets speedin, no Cudi, aye
Speedin bullet to the money, aye
I'm on the race still runnin, aye
You niggas hiding, I'm hunting, aye
Hunt with the pistol, nigga let's do it
Hide and hunt that's the new game
If you wanna play it, you don't wanna play it
Man I get the gun and I get to sprayin
These niggas talkin my bitches wavin at me
Hey, supportin me all the time
You already know that they on my team
Aye
(breath)
That bitch got a pussy that shit is a fountain but she must be racist that shit say colored people only and you know i ate it i ate it
I had to go get it by day and by day
They waiting and waiting on the day that I fall off
That's never gone happen
I gotta get back to the rapping
Making these classics
Making you niggas suffer from all of this savage shit
That I be droppin you niggas can't handle it
No you can't handle it
50 50 times for you niggas that's halftime
For you little dumb niggas I on't even know
If you get it
Gun gone get ya, get ya
Blast, split, shoot open
Into halftime
Body, you know how I get it
Drop top, remy, henny
On me, na drinking, remy, sippin remy aye

You niggas must be dreamin
Thinking that you with me yet
Heh, you crazy !!
I'm making these classics daily
These niggas they know that they hate me
These bitches they waiting on me
Let's get it !!

[Verse 5: Lucky]

I thank God everyday that I'm alive
Cuz I'd be dead or be in jail, testify
For the environments I grew up in, I seen the truth
I seen a lie nigga which one nigga fuck you
You cannot question my religion
Cause I am the boss
But I ain't no ricky, but I ain't no ross
But I ain't that truth
But I ain't like Beanie
But I ain't that ghost
You couldn't even see me
Bruh !!
That double entendre
Check it out
Check it out like Will.I.Am boy check it out
Question my ethnicity
You gone break up like a cop back 50 g's
I cop back, niggas stay for, they twist out
They twist forward, get knocked out by a petty mouth
Biggest shit, been biggest licks
I don't lick up, you link up nigga bitch shit
That biggie shit keep that A-20
Keep that A block but I know I keep goons with me
But I keep it calm and I keep it thug man
This is half time all them other niggas keep it thug
I mean keep it cool, nigga keep it wise
But keep the man, testify man stay alive
Cuz u know they killin black men out here
The fuck then is a half man nigga stay out here
WHOO !!
