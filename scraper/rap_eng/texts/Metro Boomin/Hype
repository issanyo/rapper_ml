Hype fuck the hype I want the money now got the pipe I had to gun em down might just hit em with 100 rounds
I talking bout hype niggas will for it
Wack your face off the board hug your mom the pay for your mourge
I talking bout hype look how they did Bankroll Fresh
Left My City in Disbelief Now they doing Interview and shit
*Strreeeeet*
I Talking Bout Hype I ain't with the sneak dissin
I ain't with the tongue wrestling
I ain't with the new beefing
I back out the basement feeling courageous now we be jumping on stages
I Do it for molly I did it for Molly I really don't care bout the fame shit
You play round with us and then you be dust and now a body
On the pavement
I Did for cash you did it for followers nigga you know its a deference
Understand that I come in the this bitch im the hype and you know I give em this deliverance you play round wit us I put the period on the Just like a Sentence
Im talkin bout hype undertand that im on it
Fu shit fake shit  Green Vision Can't condone it "We Blinded"
