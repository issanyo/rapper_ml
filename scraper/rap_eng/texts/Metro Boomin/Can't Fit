[Intro: Young Thug]
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Hook]
Pistol in my coupe, can't fit in my shoe
Money in the garage, can't fit in my room
Ten hoes in my bed, can't fit in my pool
Niggas in my crib, can't fit in my zoo
You ain't shootin' pistols, I can't rock with you
Money on my mental, I can't talk to you
I'm Glo Gang, I can't talk for you
I'm my own man, I can't walk for you

[Verse]
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
Lot of choppas for this war, nigga
Lot of vents 'fore I drop bars, nigga
Make my gun sing a song, you'll get chorus, nigga
8 shots comin' for you, nigga
Don't stand here, move forward, nigga
Some of my guns just got deported, nigga
But I know he gon' get it, like the phone we forward pictures
Tote that police, don't make me call my lawyer, nigga
I told homie, "Don't make me drop my 40, nigga"
I Glo'd up, uh, bitch, I'm in my Glory, nigga
And if you see me, you know I ain't worried, nigga

[Hook]
Pistol in my coupe, can't fit in my shoe
Money in the garage, can't fit in my room
Ten hoes in my bed, can't fit in my pool
Niggas in my crib, can't fit in my zoo
You ain't shootin' pistols, I can't rock with you
Money on my mental, I can't talk to you
I'm Glo Gang, I can't talk for you
I'm my own man, I can't walk for you
