Police be knockin' on young nigga's doors, knowin' nigga's off abroad
Back in the 6th grade, they think that they got me, they thought that they figured it out
They tried to take niggas on whole 'nother route, worded this shit is about
Money, mo' money, mo' money and greed, money, mo' money and greed
They didn't want us to succeed
Most of the, most of the, most of the shit that we did, we can't talk about never again, never again
Livin' this life in that sin, yeah
