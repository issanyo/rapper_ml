Yeah, baby! 1738! (Laugh)

Where you gonna be when the trumpet sound?
Where you gonna be when He finally come down?
Where you gonna be when the hourglass run out?
When the darkness gone and the Son finally come out
Where you gonna be, man, I'm tryna bring ya'll with me
Let me get some gray shades, man, now I'm fifty
Where you gonna be when he comes for his people?
Where you gonna be? Will you regret that evil?
Where you gonna be? Will be where the saints is?
When it's too late to sing "Rock Of Ages"
I think ya'll done forgot who the rage is
Wish you hadn't have ridiculed the pages
Got the one on me so I know who my friend is
When I was down, face down in the trenches
Everybody told me I wouldn't be strong
Now, I'm looking; I'm the only one lifting
Where you gonna be for the first resurrection?
Where you gonna be for your chance at perfection?
Where you gonna be when you see amazing grace?
Where you gonna be when He call you by name?
All these demons out here, but they can't come near me
Fear of God in them so I know that they fear, G
Got a lot to learn like Pre-school
I know where I'mma be and I'mma be cool
Where is you now? Is you helping build Zion?
Pretend Christ is Saturn, yeah go ahead and keep your eye on
Bygones will be bygones but, my gosh, don't die wrong
I thank that you died, Son. My cross, my God, this my song
