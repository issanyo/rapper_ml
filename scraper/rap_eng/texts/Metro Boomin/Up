[Intro: Future]
If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus]
Remember feeling broke as fuck
But now I'm pulling up in Rover trucks
(I'm pulling up in Rover Trucks now)
Remember these bitches ain't wanna fuck
Now she give me head outside of Toys R Us
(These bitches suck and fuck me now)
When you see me look, don't touch
All my shooters ballin' playing for the bucks
(shoot em up for money now)
Keep your circle small, be careful who you trust
They gon' love you when you down, not when you up

[Verse 1]
They gon' leave you when you down, not when you up
Fuck these hoes, without my bros, who can I trust?
Who else gon' help me in the jam when I get stuck? (Nobody, nobody)
Who else gon' ride out for me when my time is up?
Feel like myself again when I be on the drugs
I'm in LA, I took a yellow pill I hope it fuck me up
I'm not playin', I don't feel tired, I think the addies adding up
See the X's and the O's, and now she wanna kiss and hug
All this codeine got me stuck, but the molly get me up
My mamma call me up, but I can't pick it up
Cause my whole left side ain't movin'
I don't sell drugs but I abuse 'em
From the Rex but now I'm movin'

[Chorus]
Remember feeling broke as fuck
But now I'm pulling up in Rover trucks
(I'm pulling up in Rover Trucks now)
Remember these bitches ain't wanna fuck
Now she give me head outside of Toys R Us
(These bitches suck and fuck me now)
When you see me look, don't touch
All my shooters ballin' playing for the bucks
(They shooting all for money now)
Keep your circle small, be careful who you trust
They gon' love you when you down, not when you up

[Verse 2]
I'ma put these hoes on blast now
Cash found me, I got cash now
Watch your mouth, I pay the money
You get slapped out
Fucking hoes, I turn down shows I ice my Roley now
She didn't wanna fuck me then, but she can't fuck me now
These hoes get naked for me when I'm playin' my songs
Now my neck feel naked when I don't got chains on
Fuck all the people that ever tried to do me wrong
Now when they see me pull up, they the ones I'm shitting on
Getting high living the low life, with your wife
My gun got jammed, I couldn't bust a whole night
I fell asleep drinking lean, now I need some more ice
And yea I'm getting money, your boyfriend is a poor guy

[Chorus]
Remember feeling broke as fuck
But now I'm pulling up in Rover trucks
(I'm pulling up in Rover Trucks now)
Remember these bitches ain't wanna fuck
Now she give me head outside of Toys R Us
(These bitches suck and fuck me now)
When you see me look, don't touch
All my shooters ballin' playing for the bucks
(They shooting all for money now)
Keep your circle small, be careful who you trust
They gon' love you when you down, not when you up
If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

[Outro]
When you see me look, don't touch
All my shooters ballin', playing for the bucks
(They shooting all for money now)
Keep your circle small, be careful who you trust
They gon' love you when you down, not when you up
