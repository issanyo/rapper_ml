[Verse 1]
The fucking pimp hoe, N.E
Why?
'Cause [?] me and my family only thing I give a fuck about
The fucking pimp hoe, N.E
Why?
'Cause [?] me and my family only thing I give a fuck about
Starting to get needy, hit her head sideways
So I have to kick her out
Trap queen knows her way around the house
[?]
She's dirty [?]
Naked when she water whip, oh my god I need some help
Money all around I fuck around I fucking drop myself
Percocets and molly on Cloud 9, 'm trying to calm down?

[Verse 2]
Where the drugs at? I need them
I don't evens care what kind
Smoke a lot of weed, drink a lot of liquor
And I pop a lot of pills to ease my mind
I roll [?] about 6 millions dimes
Writing down rhymes
Fifteen in a day
Everyday exceed my brain
Smoiked out on a daily basis

When I drink nowadays I can barely taste it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Niggas rolling hard
Steady popping xanny bars
Stay sipping 'cause we're double up

Off the molly
Suck me at a party
I call her sloppy

I call her slutty
I take her to the get so naughty
