[Verse]

I be i be in the lab and i be stuntin'
If you know me , im a rapper i ain't bluffin
I'm just here to chase this money
It ain't nothin fool
I'm so cool
Don't even need to take my ass to school
I'm just smokin on that herb
While chillin with my crew
Everyday im puttin work in
You call me a tool
Im just chasin' the dough
You know that i bake it too
Get around my sick thoughts
Because i can make em groove
Get down, you know i get down
Get down, you know i get down
Jumpman jumpman jumpman
Must be up to somethin'
All you hatin' bitches
You do not know nothin'
I hear 'em dissin but it don't do nothin'
Im in the studio everyday
You suckas be bluffin'
