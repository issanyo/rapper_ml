Warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior, warrior, I'm a warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior, warrior
Motherfuckin' warrior
If a nigga think he better than me with the heater
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he please 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he tease 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he eat 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him

[Verse 1]
Pull up on bitches and ride 'em on top of the rentals
Lookin' like, "What did you say?"
Thugger bend them bitches straight over just like a center
Fuck 'em with the F&N
She like to take molly, she pop a capsule with the Thug
If I fall in love like Danny Glover
You bitches know I'm not ballin', these bitches know I'm not touchin'
They want to plead to Thug and then nip it in the bud
This announcement should be publical
I want to come from Uranus
I'm livin' my life mechanical, she leave white stains on my jeans
I'm a red bull, I need wings
She let Metro get between
He bling, she fiend, she Billie no Jean
She wing, she mad, she try cause a scene
Pull up in a panorama
Let her read my lips, I wanna hit it from the bi-nack
Illest nigga livin', watch me turn up on a partner
Now I know they comin' bi-nack
Hit ya from the fri-nont, bi-nack, si-nide, on top fli-nat
Young Thugger be a kind motherfucker
Hit you in the Maybach closed curtains

[Hook]
Warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior, warrior, I'm a warrior, warrior

Motherfuckin' warrior
If a nigga think he better than me with the heater
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he please 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he tease 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he eat 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him

[Verse 2]
Warrior
My rings is the solar, my diamonds are shiny
They base with Napoleon
My dick's what they holdin'
They need to let go, before it stretch like Fruit Roll-Ups
They're strippers I know this
And all they ass fat, they fuck up my focus
No, I didn't call up my bro, no call up my whoadie
They pull up unnoticed
(Come running with slime, Nickolodeon )
I check in and check out the club
Baby I don't have time for no more
You can have that back
I just had it the trap spot for sure
I swear I just saw my brother get a fuckin' life sentence
And I know my momma still in pain
That's why I'mma kill him when I catch him in the village
Fuck nigga done changed up the game
You supposed to held a nigga down for the chain
You supposed to held a nigga down for the Range
That's why I'm chillin' and things
I'm tryna maintain, my brain wanna go insane

[Hook]
Warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior, warrior, I'm a warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior, warrior

If a nigga think he better than me with the heater
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he please 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he tease 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he eat 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
