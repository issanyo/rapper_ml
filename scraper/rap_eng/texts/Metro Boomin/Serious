[Hook: Trinidad James]
My niggas in this party they might kill you, kill you
These bitches in this party look familiar, familiar
Your bitch up in the party, oh I feel you, feel you
She bust it like a stripper man I'm serious, serious

[Bridge: Trinidad James + Curtis Williams]
I'm serious (hey, hey)
Serious (look)
I'm serious (uh)
Serious (look)

[Verse 1: Curtis Williams]
I said neighboorhood on my back
Pocket full of that cash
Bounce out with your lady
She 'bout to let me smash
You broke man, I just laughed
I'm facing this, no past
Grade good, no class
I'm blowing money too fast
My pockets straight, I can't help but spend it
White girl and some rare women
We don't tuck chains if I get a weapon
I'm stunting hoe, and ain't nothing tinted
Can't no nigga do like me
I said that and I meant it
Hippy life, I live it
My mind all on these Grinches
Said these niggas influenced
By my team and my movement
I'm riding low and I'm cruising
They tryna see what I'm doing
Uh, you can't stop a nigga
This one for my city
And if you rolling up some gas
Come and smoke it with me

[Bridge: Trinidad James]
I'm serious
Serious
I'm serious
Serious

[Hook: Trinidad James]
My niggas in this party they might kill you, kill you
These bitches in this party look familiar, familiar
Your bitch up in the party, oh I feel you, feel you
She bust it like a stripper man I'm serious, serious

[Bridge: Trinidad James]
I'm serious (too goddamn clean, nigga)
Serious (you seen that motherfucking [?] nigga with them wings on that motherfucking jammer [?], bitch?)
I'm serious
Serious (made you feel so tight boy nigga)

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
Hah, hah, man, fuck the police!
Man, fuck the police!
I say nah nigga, I ain't killing
My niggas jumpy like Blake Griffin
Take your bitch like "hey baby"
I'll pimp but she straight missing
All dick and no cash
Pussy on my mustache
Feeling like a French man
"Comment allez-vous?"
That's what I tell a bitch when she's through
I hope the bitch ain't your boo
And if it is, "nigga oops!"
Young hoe does swoop
All I know is violence
These lame niggas is silence
These young hoes be wylin'
You feeling good, then try it
That pussy good, I might buy it
I hope it's two for the five
These new hoes gon' ride
Got James on her side, bitch!

[Bridge: Trinidad James]
I'm serious
Serious
I'm serious
Serious

[Hook: Trinidad James]
My niggas in this party they might kill you, kill you
These bitches in this party look familiar, familiar
Your bitch up in the party, oh I feel you, feel you
She bust it like a stripper man I'm serious, serious

[Outro: Trinidad James + Curtis Williams]
Bounce out with your lady
She 'bout to let me smash
Smash, smash, smash
She 'bout to let me smash
That pussy good, I might buy it
I hope it's two for the five
These young hoes be wylin'
These new hoes gon' ride
Can't no nigga do like me
I said that and I meant it
Take your bitch like "hey baby"
I'll pimp but she straight missing
You can't stop a nigga
This one for my city
And if you rolling up some gas
Come and smoke it with me
