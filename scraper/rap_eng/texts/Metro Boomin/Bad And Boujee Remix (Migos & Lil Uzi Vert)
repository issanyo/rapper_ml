[Intro]
Raindrop (drip), drop top (drop top)
Smokin' on cookie in the hotbox (cookie)
Fuckin' on your bitch, she a thot, thot (thot)
Cookin' up dope in the crockpot (pot)
(Catch me outside, how 'bout that?)
We came from nothin' to somethin', nigga (hey)
I don't trust nobody, grip the trigger (nobody)
Call up the gang and they come and get ya (gang)
Cry me a river, give you a tissue (hey)
My bitch is bad and boujee (bad)
Cookin' up dope with a Uzi (blaow)
My niggas is savage, ruthless (savage)
(Stompdown Killaz, motherfucker)
We got 30's and 100 rounds too (grrah)
My bitch is bad and boujee (bad)
Cookin' up dope with a Uzi (dope)
My niggas is savage, ruthless (hey)
(New album coming soon)
We got 30's and 100 rounds too (glah)

[Verse]
Nahh, I ain't cookin' dope in a crack pot but I might split them down the middle like a pom-pom, dawgie I'm the don one, prolly wearin' Sean John, drive by and shoot you in your whip
That's a hot bar
All these rappers always flexin' on a 'gram til I show up at their show with a weapon in my hands and I'm lettin' it go blam
Leave 'em right there where they stand, parked the hearse out side, tell the reverend in advance
Hey, I'm the motherfuckin' man now, I don't get on stage for at least three grands now, yeah
There are for the handouts, see me on your TV like the dude sellin' sham while
I ain't fuckin' with like half of these rappers 'cause I've been bringing back to music the shit actually matter and I'm on top
If you lookin' for me, go grab a ladder
You think you hard but you rappers sound like Hannah Montana
I got a habit for smashing melons and emptying the seeds
I take a look around and see nobody in my league, capish
I don't give about a thot-thot, put a gun in your mouth and pop like Pop Rocks
I'm about to piss the whole damn world off, fuck around and find me your homes like Sherlock (Sherlock)
Shirt off in your fridge with a Smirnoff, drink it all and I gotta go 'cause your girl call
In a whip and it's prolly got it heavy, got a bottle full of henny, eating wobbles down at Dannies
Fat boy, little caesar hot and ready.. I used to smoke blunts while my mama made spaghetti
That's not a man that can get in my spot
I'm 'bout to battle a beast and he down the king of the dot
They say I'm sick, and I'm gettin' the cough, you can listen and nod, I'm still pissin' dem off, heeeyy

[Chorus]
Raindrop (drip), drop top (drop top)
Smokin' on cookie in the hotbox (cookie)
Fuckin' on your bitch, she a thot, thot (thot)
Cookin' up dope in the crockpot (pot)
We came from nothin' to somethin', nigga (hey)
I don't trust nobody, grip the trigger (nobody)
Call up the gang and they come and get ya (gang)
Cry me a river, give you a tissue (hey)
My bitch is bad and boujee (bad)
Cookin' up dope with a Uzi (blaow)
My niggas is savage, ruthless (savage)
We got 30's and 100 rounds too (grrah)
My bitch is bad and boujee (bad)
Cookin' up dope with a Uzi (dope)
My niggas is savage, ruthless (hey)
We got 30's and 100 rounds too (glah)

[Verse 2]
Why everybody gotta hate on the kid?
Smoke an aid to the face that's the way that I live, so don't make no mistake, put the blade to your ribs 'cause I started from the bottom..
Dawg, I came from the sticks, suck on my dick I've been coming to kill 'em, I'm eatin' suckers for dinner, somebody please pass the mustard
You ain't rappin', you just mumblin', motherfucker, but still ain't sellin' records, so I can't tell what's worse? (What's worse?)
Ha, word.. I really is the shit now, everytime you go to the bathroom I bet you sit down, fuck around with us you get the message like a pin pale
Catch me out in Washington poppin' bottles with Denzel, I've been broke eating instant noodles, one call and we show up like a lift from Mumbai, whole squad go hard like long-distant and we stay on point like tits in hooters
Yeah, the kid too slick like Rick the Ruler and the weed so green like Flick&Polgars, and y'all butter soft as sippin' koolers, I'm a dog off the leash I ain't gettin' neutered, naahh
No, I ain't got a thirty or a hundred round but I'm Terry Fox on the beat, I could run a mile
Vampire, I come out when the sun go down, hoes used to hate
I noticed that they love me now (Love me now)
That's right I'm the new dude solved it, If they got beef you can tell 'em fruits rolled up
Why you always gotta rap about food still, so fucked up, I took the red and the blue pill, in the speedo sippin' san pellegrino, chillin' in the sand with a tan like a Guido then I'm the mountains goin' H.A.M. on a ski slope
In the Vegas ass-naked, now I'm banned from casinos

[Chorus]
Raindrop (drip), drop top (drop top)
Smokin' on cookie in the hotbox (cookie)
Fuckin' on your bitch, she a thot, thot (thot)
Cookin' up dope in the crockpot (pot)
We came from nothin' to somethin', nigga (hey)
I don't trust nobody, grip the trigger (nobody)
Call up the gang and they come and get ya (gang)
Cry me a river, give you a tissue (hey)
My bitch is bad and boujee (bad)
Cookin' up dope with a Uzi (blaow)
My niggas is savage, ruthless (savage)
We got 30's and 100 rounds too (grrah)
My bitch is bad and boujee (bad)
Cookin' up dope with a Uzi (dope)
My niggas is savage, ruthless (hey)
We got 30's and 100 rounds too (glah)
