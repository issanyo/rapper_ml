Straight Juice
Armaan the brothers are all fucking fake
We all know it, stop bein a slippery snake
Sorry bout breakin your prada frames…
Sungbeen pushed me, we were just playin a game
We all know that those fancy cars ain't yours
So drop to the floor and get on all of your fours
Sorry bro don’t wanna make you pout
But why do you pretend like you workout?
Walkin round the weight room like you a boss
Sorry brown boy had to hit you with the cross

Chorus
Sorry brown boy, youve been exposed
The path to bein a doctor? Yeah that’s been closed
You can take over the Singh family buisness
Driving dat yellow car, God is your witness
Oh wait your brown ass ain't even celebrate Christmas

Ricky Lo
Come on bro just look at it from our angle
Your dumbass dont know the opposite of a triangle
We see you man, peekin at drews paper
Shit bro those eyes got you lookin like an ass raper
Soccer game 12 o clock sharp with the fam?
Thats bullshit bro like the answers on your exam
Beggin me everyday to buy you some food?
Looks like that taxi fair just ain't enough dude

Chorus
Sorry brown boy, youve been exposed
The path to bein a doctor? Yeah that’s been closed
You can take over the Singh family buisness
Driving dat yellow car, God is your witness
Oh wait your brown ass ain't even celebrate Christmas

Lil Toad
Yo what up. Its Lil toad
I play ball at lunch with my IHMS bros
Might wanna check on your red dotted grandma
Cus i gave her that D, and jizzed on her face
So sit down skinny boy and let me put you in your place
I see you over there you lanky ass bitch
You so gay you need a butthole stitch

Chorus
Sorry brown boy, youve been exposed
The path to bein a doctor? Yeah that’s been closed
You can take over the Singh family buisness
Driving dat yellow car, God is your witness
Oh wait your brown ass ain't even celebrate Christmas
