[Intro]
If young metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1]
Louis V on, I got on VLONE
I just bought a new chain, that bitch three-tone
I'm in Designer, red bottoms spiked up like pinecones
Spike the pineapple, double cup styrofoam
I got the AP and the Rollie switching time zones
You could turn off all the lights, I put them diamonds on
We the Big Tymers, nigga, we get our shine on
My trap house like a pop-up, the line long

[Chorus]
I do this shit
I do this shit
I do this shit
I do this shit
I do this shit
I do this shit
I do this shit
I do this shit
I do this shit

[Verse 2]
Left wrist a Rollie, VS diamonds all white
Putting Hitech in the Fanta, only mix the Act with Sprite
Kick that bitch up out the spot if she ain't acting right
Cookie, Percs, and lean, nigga, I'm up there with the satellites
Hood nigga shooting dice, I'm just fucking, that's your wife
I've been turning bitches into dice, skinny jeans fit me tight
Smoking cookie, fucking on a bitch with a pretty pussy
Been the same real one, nigga, I ain't never, ever been a pussy
I got dope on my Rollie, you would think a nigga was still cooking
Diamonds so wet, damn, I think it got your bitch gushing
Got your bitch looking, got on red bottoms like I'm a Christian
With them bricks in, I'ma fuck up the kitchen
Put the dick in her and I make her kiss
Put on the AP when I go to Michigan
Rocking the VLONE, long as you can't get it
"How you do three-tone?" Mind your business
Hundred round, hundred niggas pull up with it
'Bout to go put me some tint on the Bentley
Bought Gucci and Prada, or Louis and Fendi
I'm wet like a pool, I'm fresh like some lettuce
Designer head to toe, I just went and spent me a ten at Lenox

[Chorus]
I do this shit
I do this shit
I do this shit
I do this shit
I do this shit
I do this shit
I do this shit
I do this shit
I do this shit
