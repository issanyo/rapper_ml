[Hook: Monty]
For a small fee, I could put the drop in
Don't be mad at me ‘cause you not poppin'
I do what I please, you ain't got a option
I see couple G's every time I clock in
For a small fee, I could put the drop in
Don't be mad at me ‘cause you not poppin'
I do what I please, you ain't got a option
I see couple G's every time I clock in

[Verse 1: Monty]
You see Monty Zoo, that nigga on some fly shit
I hear niggas talking but they ain't got shit
How you hit the mall up and you ain't cop shit?
Got my city on lock, you gon' need a locksmith
Bitch I'm seventeen and you niggas not it
I keep a Glock clip and I like to pop shit
Niggas hating on me ‘cause a nigga got rich
One phone call, I'll hold a nigga hostage
I got where I'm at ‘cause I put the time in
Seventeen shots turn you to a omelette
Shorty shake it for me every time she log in
I kill a parking lot every time I drive in
Remy Boy, Zoo Gang, I'm a zoo god
Just to get my Benz you gon' need a few jobs
Zoovy Zoo and Monty Zoo, I say that two times
Zoovy Zoo and Monty Zoo, I say that two times

[Hook: Monty]
For a small fee, I could put the drop in
Don't be mad at me ‘cause you not poppin'
I do what I please, you ain't got a option
I see couple G's every time I clock in
For a small fee, I could put the drop in
Don't be mad at me ‘cause you not poppin'
I do what I please, you ain't got a option
I see couple G's every time I clock in

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Monty Zoo, I told these niggas that you next up
Ay, anybody want war better vest up
Ay, I'm a zoo god, I just run the checks up
A hundred thou on me, all times, put your bets up
Bitch you must be trippin' or indifferent, bitch I'm Zoovy Zoo
Zoo Gang niggas winnin', codependence in the latest coupes
Used to have to listen, I'm the boss so now I make the rules
Swear that boy consistent, [?], penetrate the zoo
I got hella bitches, dumb and [?], I don't have to choose
Tryna come for my brother, kill his brother and his sister too
Hold his mom for hostage till he pop up, then I let off too
Monty Zoo, I told you that I got us, bitch we run the zoo, gang

[Interlude: Fetty Wap]
Squad!
The fuck these niggas talking 'bout, man?
Monty Zoo up next, nigga
And I got a check for any nigga that think he ain't, bruh
Run your bands up, nigga

[Hook: Monty]
For a small fee, I could put the drop in
Don't be mad at me ‘cause you not poppin'
I do what I please, you ain't got a option
I see couple G's every time I clock in
