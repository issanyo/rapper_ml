3 exotic broads and I got 'em soakin' panties
Told 'em they were certified, welcome to the xanny family
Wow, wow (welcome to the family baby)
Wow, wow
3 exotic broads and I got 'em soakin' panties
Told 'em they were certified, welcome to the xanny family
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 1]
3 exotic broads and I got 'em actin' jiggy
Got 'em suckin', takin' bars, now they screamin' team litty
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, team litty
I'm just tryna slide on lil shawty hit the side though
You get penalized, you come around, It ain't enough dough
Keep a bag of xannies if you tryna join the family
Got the sauce on me and it's off-white tanny
Puerto rican freakin' oh she sneakin', I done ordered up
She was goin' in the spur like a party bus
Pardon me, before I take a greed I never brag or boast
She ain't speak no inglo, but I know she like to tweak that coke

[Verse 2]
Promethazine/codeine this shit champagne for us
The sauce look so clean like some angel dust
We workin' ever day, it ain't the same for us
You comin' to the crib, bring a gang of tuss
I dip it in the blunt, I'm tryna smoke the mud
I loaded up my gun, I'm tryna smoke the plug
When I get to wavin' this hammer I'm gonna soak ya up
I got trophies, I got Dolce, got a way bigger bus
I get loaded to the ceiling, gotta roll me some bud
I'mma dab inside that bag, but I don't play with my nose
Got some oxycont, some roxy, 'bout to play with these hoes
Got these bitches drunk and sloppy, ready to come out they clothes too
