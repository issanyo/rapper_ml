[Intro]
DrugRixh
See, I done been to some locations where the nigga couldn't go
I'll take a fine boujee bitch and hit that hoe on the floor, ha
Yeah, I'll hit that hoe on the floor, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Real street nigga, never been a hoe
Word around town, Hect done got them bags for the low
I had to switch up my location, I don't trap there no more
I take a fine actress bitch and hit that hoe on the floor
And you ain't built like us, nigga, so I know you a hoe
This shit for us, anything I'm standing for, I'm dying 'bout it
I keep a hundred-plus rounds every time I'm fucking sliding
My Backwood stuffed crust, I'm just trying to ease on my mind

[Verse 1]
It ain't a day go by that I don't miss my cousin
I used to sleep on pallets with you, now you're floating above me
I keep that thing tucked for real, no, I ain't going for nothing
And I'll never fold, nigga, 'cause I ain't saying nothing
I'll put that pistol on your buddy, make him shit and vomit
I trapped on [?] behind the [?] when I was a youngin'
I trapped at every apartments on the [?], nigga, I was chasing money
My GD partner on Sentry Drive moving bags for me

[Chorus]
Real street nigga, never been a hoe
Word around town, Hect done got them bags for the low
I had to switch up my location, I don't trap there no more
I take a fine actress bitch and hit that hoe on the floor
And you ain't built like us, nigga, so I know you a hoe
This shit for us, anything I'm standing for, I'm dying 'bout it
I keep a hundred-plus rounds every time I'm fucking sliding
My Backwood stuffed crust, I'm just trying to ease on my mind

[Verse 2]
If you ain't with this shit, then nigga, you against it
Pull up, hit that shit up, have y'all niggas jumping fences
And I ain't sliding fishbowl, everything tinted
"I thought you was the man? You fell off" Well, that's bad business
I pulled up to the dugout spot, I still got bags in it
K got a tip, so a hundred rounds in it
I'll pull up at your bitch house, she smoked the bag with me
We pushed dope a hundred deep, one hundred rags with me

[Chorus]
Real street nigga, never been a hoe
Word around town, Hect done got them bags for the low
I had to switch up my location, I don't trap there no more
I take a fine actress bitch and hit that hoe on the floor
And you ain't built like us, nigga, so I know you a hoe
This shit for us, anything I'm standing for, I'm dying 'bout it
I keep a hundred-plus rounds every time I'm fucking sliding
My Backwood stuffed crust, I'm just trying to ease on my mind
