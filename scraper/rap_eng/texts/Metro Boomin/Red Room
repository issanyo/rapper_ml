[Intro]
Woo

[Chorus]
I'm a maniac go crazy for the cash (Hey, crazy)
Green Lamborghini, paper tags (Skrrt)
Ridin’ through the city, 30 mags (Brrt, bow)
Niggas snitchin', they the police with no badge (Woo, woo, woo)
How I grew up, my momma was my dad (Momma, huh)
So when I blew up I put her in a pad (Mansion)
I like to throw up when I think about the crash (Ugh, ugh)
Not playin', when I hit the tree I smell the gas (Hey, hey)
Lookin’ at the sky, think about my past (Sky)
When I used to kick a door, shoot you for the cash (Boot, boot, boot)
Everybody hit the floor 'fore you make me mad (Floor)
Devil had a nigga soul livin' too fast
Prayin' to the Lord, my soul to keep (Keep)
Controllin' me (Me), take a hold of me (Hold)
Bitches ain't shit, got exposed by heat ('Sposed)
So naive, cold in the streets (Streets)

[Verse 1]
Sleep on my feet (Feet)
Money turn homies to zombies, they eat (Zombies)
Miss my grandma, she was humble and sweet (Grandma)
I don't speak, let the check talk for me (Check, woo)
I can’t sleep ’less the Tec in my reach (Tec)
Hit the dope, make me choke, make me wheeze (Choke, woo)
Sip the dope, help the pain at ease (Hey)
Tryna get the money 'fore it clean, it was dirty (Dirty)
Playin’ football, hide the fire in my gutter (Ha)
Gettin' locked up, runnin' round in a circle (Circle)
Brother caught fifteen like he did a murder (Murder)
Now my whole family hurtin' (Hurtin’)
Tryna see the light but we couldn't pull the curtain (Curtain, curtain, curtain)
Night time lurkin' (Night, night), momma said the streetlights 'bout to stop workin' (Light, light, light)
Lookin' at my momma in her eyes (Momma)
Lookin' at me like a new person (New person)
She tellin' me I need to slow down (Slow down)
The pain don't go away with the percy (Slow down)
That was when the rap weren't working (Weren't working)
Living in the trap it's a search (Trap search)
See my grandma in a hearse (Grandma)
And Pistol P gone in the casket
Shot's fired nigga blasting (Brrt)
Cops, they arrive start smashing (Woop, woop)
Opps we shoot shots like the Mavericks (Opps)
Vaults put the cash up and we stash it (Stash)
You flop, we doing numbers can't imagine (Hey)
Money tunnel when the roof panoramic (Skrrt)
Count the bottles 'til my hand start crampin' (Cramp)
I come with the drip I need a napkin (Hey)

[Chorus]
I'm a maniac go crazy for the cash (Hey, crazy)
Green Lamborghini, paper tags (Skrrt)
Ridin' through the city, 30 mags (Brrt, bow)
Niggas snitchin', they the police with no badge (Woo, woo, woo)
How I grew up, my momma was my dad (Momma, huh)
So when I blew up I put her in a pad (Mansion)
I like to throw up when I think about the crash (Ugh, ugh)
Not playin', when I hit the tree I smell the gas (Hey, hey)
Lookin' at the sky, think about my past (Sky)
When I used to kick a door, shoot you for the cash (Boot, boot, boot)
Everybody hit the floor 'fore you make me mad (Floor)
Devil had a nigga soul livin' too fast

Controllin' me (Me), take a hold of me (Hold)
Bitches ain't shit, got exposed by heat ('Sposed)
So naive, cold in the streets (Streets)

[Verse 2]
I been crossed out by my own brother (Woo, woo)
Ain't no rules in the street don't trust 'em
Ran it up and I had to go buss it
Police 'bout to kick the door now we gotta flush it
Ridin' on the back streets thinkin' 'bout my brother
Prayin' that he come home to his loving mother
Can't believe it that I got it all out the gutter
Facetime 'round three, Mike in a puddle
How am I 'posed to take it? (How?)
Niggas dying around the same time I had a baby (Hoo)
Here go the operator (Operator)
Let the gang know Pistol ain't 'gon make it (He ain't 'gon make it)
Now my mind going brazy (Brazy)
Got me feeling like I was the cause of the hatred (I'm the cause of it)
Golden revolver with the laser (Boop)
They done killed my nigga start a war bring the nation (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
I got a boss situation (Boss)
Military basis when we travel 'cross the nation (Military)
Double up the cup with maple (Woo)
Abomination on your paper I got acres
Black man when you walking and you labeled
Beat the odds they don't wanna see you greater
Eat you alive like a lion or a 'gator
Momma's crying cause the police shot they babies
They crooked the motherland they done took it (Crooked)
They take us and lock us up and throw the buckle (Take us)
Started rapping then I shook it (Shook it)
I hate the fame everybody keep on looking (Fame)
We done sold out Brooklyn (Sold out)
Man I miss my Grandma cookin' (Grandma)
Treat me like a don 'cause I'm gifted (Like a don)
I'm a run the money up gotta go and get it (Hey)

[Chorus]
I'm a maniac go crazy for the cash (Hey, crazy)
Green Lamborghini, paper tags (Skrrt)
Ridin' through the city, 30 mags (Brrt, bow)
Niggas snitchin', they the police with no badge (Woo, woo, woo)
How I grew up, my momma was my dad (Momma, huh)
So when I blew up I put her in a pad (Mansion)
I like to throw up when I think about the crash (Ugh, ugh)
Not playin', when I hit the tree I smell the gas (Hey, hey)
Lookin' at the sky, think about my past (Sky)
