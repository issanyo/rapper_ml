I told my self I need some money (m-o-n-e-y)
Before I went to sleep said I was hungry (then what)
Than I woke up and got some money (Rack, Rack racks!)
These niggas talk but they won't harm me
I woke up and got some
Racks, Stacks, I need all the cash
Spent 200 for 200 on the dash
Bitch say she want a cat so I bought a jag
Pull up curb side flexing on they ass

[Verse 1: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
Pourin' the drank, then I'm gon' fire up the dank
Cookin' fish tails no fish tanks
We robbin' the bank, don't give a fuck what you think
Walkin' around with a bank
Neighbors complain
Give her them racks she gone faint
There is no limits like tanks
Bitch I can't hear what you sayin'
100 grand stuffed in my pants
100 grand spent in Japan
100 grand stuffed in my pants
Gotta nigga feeling like the man
100 grand make a nigga oohh damn
100 grand 100 grand damn 100 bands
100 grand blowing like whore fan
100 grand stuffed in a Sudan, keep that
Ooo
Catch a nigga bitch in jail free that

You lookin' for them guys, hoe? Best know we that

[Verse 2]
The Forgies gone spin
I got two gorgeous lil twins
Sitting in the back of the Benz
I pray for my sins
Swear i won't do it again
I living my life like a black ken
Got races lil friends
Now I got tats on my shen
My shoes are mason margins
No ones with me jins
I only talk to my friends
Cuz he 5 50 like benz
You ain't gang banging u ain't doing none nigga
You ain't talkin' money you ain't talkin' sense nigga
Got five houses n they ain't even for rent nigga
I know throwing big bucks at these cent niggas
I woke up and money on me today
Before I go to sleep best believe a young nigga gon' pray
