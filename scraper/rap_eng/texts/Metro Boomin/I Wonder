[Hook]
I wonder, aye
How much can a young nigga make?
I wonder, aye
Will there be a day where that I don't wait?
I wonder, aye
Who this bitch gon say she love today?
I wonder, aye
Will I have to use these guns today?

[Verse 1: SD]
I wonder
Will I get some cake today?
Will I make it to the top and gets my peoples all straight?
I wonder
Will I smoke my life away?
Will I wake up in a mansion and have no worries in my way?
Don't be dull boy
Cause I got essays 'round my way
I wonder if this gun shoot, who gon end up late?
But it's okay
Cause we got ammo for the race
I hope you tie yo lace boy, shit ain't safe
I wonder
This bitch might just fly away
She bugging me too much to wanna stay
I wonder
Will I be rich today?
Or will I have to sit around and wait?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: SD]
I wonder
Will this one day be my day?
Will I take over the world, can I hold my own weight?
I wonder
Shit, am I here to stay?
Or if you try to rob will you meet your death day? [a better place]
Don't trust these hoes, they trynna say
My money too important, had to use my alternate
But I'm okay
I'm feeling good by the way
Sometimes I get the feels, that's when I smoke one to the face
I'm living great
I can't worry 'bout today
I wonder in what country will I spend my life away?
I wonder
Will my pockets grow today?
Shit, how much can a young nigga make?
