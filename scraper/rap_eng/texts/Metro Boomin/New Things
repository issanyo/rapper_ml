[Intro: JAY THE GREAT]
It's Jay

Yeah

[Verse 1: JAY THE GREAT]
My mind is on another planet yeah it could be Saturn
And if I never wrote these bars I would have never had it
Yeah this rap attack flow sharp enough to stab them
And if I really want the money then I gotta grab it

If I gotta go on this mad flow
Boy don't play you already know
Half these rappers they a circus show

Yeah

And if my money ain't in washing cars
Then I guess it must be spitting bars
'Cause I'm in the studio grinding hard

Yeah

[Hook: JAY THE GREAT] x2
Flexin' on some new things
YOUNGTHRILL we some new kids

[Bridge: JAY THE GREAT]
If we thrillin' we about to get it (get it)
If it's payday then we 'bout to spend it
Yeah our clothes, man we never lending
It's the beginning we ain't never ending

Yeah my ride is up in A Town
My group was born in K Town
If you can't stay up, stay down
If you can't stand, then lay down
I can make you queen bae
But I can't make you queen shae
If you want a holiday then listen to what Imma say

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: MKL]
Sickest with the illest beat you try to comprehend
Vacatin' for a while, but I returned to rap again
Never lose my focus on any hoes or fake friends
Do not be the sheep 'cause I'm a lion
Plotting in it's den

You sent all these men to try and get me
Homies thought I'm trippin', but I think it's funny
Bedsheets coated with the blood
Brain splattered on the money
Murderer by blood, you could me the black Ted Bundy

Feelin' empty, when I kick it real alone
Or smokin' a fat J, rapping lyrics of the dome
Or getting constant head, while the hoe screams and moans
Or try to contemplate on my life, 'cause you know I'm grown

Screw your tone
Molesting chiggas on a daily with this demon flow
Shooting and polluting while this other week I rolled
Mary Jane into some paper, puffing gettin' stoned
Mind slowly crippling while I relax smokin' O's

[Bridge: JAY THE GREAT]
My level meditation
No hating no medication
We wearing hype clothes, Bapin' yeah no education
We dropping ten songs, bring your girl let's have a sing along
If you want a girlfriend tip, never tell that her she's wrong

[Verse 3: MATTAE]
We getting high on music we have a mic instead of a fuckin' bong
K Town reppin' hard I gotta show them fakers my other tongue
You already know boy, Seoul City is where I'm representin'
Yeah I got
Bape on, money slippin' out my pocket I be flexin' all day

I ain't letting no fake bitch take my spot
Following the footsteps of Microdot
And I gotta get my way to the top man y'all already know it
I'll be going hard 'till the day that I die
We YOUNGTHRILL we ride or die
Like Bonnie and Clyde

You already know it

[Hook] x2
