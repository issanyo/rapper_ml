[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
But my pockets is pregnant
I got a message from Texas
VVS is on flexin', 'cause it go by 90 SS's
Got a ferarri selection
And I eat money for breakfast
I shoot 2 different addresses
But one in different direction
And every section I'm a turn it to a smoke section
Pay me let me catch you before the hoes get you
I ain't no drug dealer baby I'm a dope stretcher
A million dollar play came through in a text message
I walk in my foes looking for the best exit
You never seen a million dollars but you just met it
You sending me the voice mail are you hard headed
Oh you ain't gotta call me, call the paramedics

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Got a team of real niggas that's my hit squad
Ye I'm the refull of mad bitch but I fuck with the Brick Squad
Flip the 10 pack I sprung the prophet on my wrist
This that East Atlanta slash south Memphis shit
My mouth piece cold and my swag sick
And you know my recipe slick
Straight out the trap but I never ever touch the brick
The same way I never ever trust a bitch
I ring before my ball, worst 6 digits every time they call
I ain't even got to fuck her when she see me I make her cum
Mary Jane and some strong ain't gonna laugh like I'm sprung
Smoking out the pee hole and this hundred rack trunk
