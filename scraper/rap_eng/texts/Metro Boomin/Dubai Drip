Dubai drip on my Dubai shit
In-mashallah marshmallows on my wrist
Buggati on the strip

Lil Pump take your lip like asthmatics
Snow bunny see the hole fuck a jack rabbit
Pat paddick paddick playing Patek addict
Hair long afro Kaepernick
Billie Jean, the kid mine can't, call it
If I take another shot I'll be alcoholic
Sick tonic

Secret shit that'll end all this
But that's off topic
Your old shit can't top it
Your new shit, washer
Too many diamonds on can't mosh pit
None of my diamonds treated
Diamonds all anemic

Oops I mean this shit crazy

What you know about a milli on the schedule?
Everyday I flex it's hard to keep my schedule flexible

[Verse 2]

Hardcore T-raw ain't nothing edited
Money on the seesaw both sides levitate

All this cake it's time to celebrate
Tel em' wait (Hold up)

All I do is work you can check my resume

[Refrain]
Okay I get so busy yeah
Hoes get so dizzy yeah
Tried to let her go
But the hoe like a frisbee uh
What you know about a milli on the schedule?
Everyday I flex it's hard to keep my schedule flexible
