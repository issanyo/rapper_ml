I want to dedicate this chant to my people locked down livin life in the yard
(KEEP IT GANGSTA)
Keep a shank boofed up in their tape just in case a thug wanna play hard
(KEEP IT GANGSTA)
All this ice-grillin talk bout you King of New York, now you wanna call a guard
(THAT AIN'T GANGSTA)
But it's too late when the guard show up, cause your body's going straight to the morgue
(YOU SAY KEEP IT GANGSTA)

I wanna dedicate this jam to the ladies holding spots when they fellows locked down
(KEEP IT GANGSTA)
Keep a Glock in they pocket blowin shots till they pray I'm in town
(KEEP IT GANGSTA)
And to the snitch that ratted on rich - the streets got you 16 rounds
(THAT AIN'T GANGSTA)
But theres only one place for a gully rat, six feet under the ground
(YOU SAY KEEP IT GANGSTA)

[Big Jack] (Butch Cassidy)
Ah, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
Yo, stop with the posin
Y'all ain't really holdin
I'm about to open, a chapter of the Omen
Casket, closin, bodies, frozen
I've, been chosen, y'all forsaken
Ante up, so the chains get taken
Flash backs of the rock season in the making
Ain't no more MC'n, ice is just gleamin
And you wonder why you got robbed, cause your life had no meaning, fake gangstas
(YOU SAY KEEP IT GANGSTA)

[Hook: Wyclef] (Butch Cassidy)

(...GANGSTER)
Nobody, nobody, nobody
(YOU SAY KEEP IT GANGSTA)

[Sharissa] (Butch Cassidy)
Now what would you do if Henchman's came for you? (GANGSTA)
9 out of 10 times you would flee your crew (GANGSTA)
So before you lie and say you running these streets (YOU SAY KEEP IT GANGSTA)
You better watch out cause they have heat (GANGSTA)
Now what would you do if Big Jack came for you? (GANGSTA)
