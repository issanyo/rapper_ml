[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Isaac Reese]
It's going down tonight
I'll do your body right
If you have the time
It's going down tonight
It's going down tonight
I'll do your body right
If you have the time
It's going down tonight

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
You must be a special lady, I know
'Cause everywhere we go
You always bring attention to me
You gotta be a special lady, fo' sho'
I know, I love the way you makin me tweek (Ooooh baby)
Love the outfit you're wearin', that's dope
Just as sure as chronic makes me choke
Girl I never ever want you to leave (Heeehay lady)
Would you like to go and see a movie? Let's go
I hope we can make another movie tonight (Ooooh baby)
First we'll get in the jacuzzi, no clothes
I know, in a minute I'll be lickin' you dry (Heeeeey)
The next scene is really amazing, no joke
You prone, girl it's on

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Isaac Reese]
It's going down tonight
I'll do your body right
If you have the time
It's going down tonight (I said it's going down tonight)
It's going down tonight
I'll do your body right
If you have the time
It's going down tonight

[Verse 2: Isaac Reese]
The love I'm tryin' to give
Is better than a one night stand
They say you're a hell of a woman
Well I can be a hell of a man
The way you stole my heart
I'd even cook you breakfast in bed
And you don't have to move a muscle
Just lay back and relax, chill

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Isaac Reese]
It's going down tonight
I'll do your body right
If you have the time
It's going down tonight
It's going down tonight
I'll do your body right
If you have the time
It's going down tonight

[Verse 3: Danny "Butch" Means]
It seems like only yesterday
I first met you
Grey skies turned blue
I wish I knew
Why do you always hesitate?
What did I do?
All I wanna do is be with you
Baby can it go down

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Isaac Reese]
It's going down tonight
I'll do your body right
If you have the time
It's going down tonight
It's going down tonight
I'll do your body right
If you have the time
It's going down tonight
