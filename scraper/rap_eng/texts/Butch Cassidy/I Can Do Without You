[Chorus:]
I can do without you all right
I can do without you better
I can do without you allright
I can do without you

[Verse 2:]
Stop sweating me over little things you know what Im trying to do
I'm only trying to make it better for me and the family
And you If I sit Around the house  all day then Im a sorry ass punk
Im a failure I flunked damned if I do damned if I don't therefore I must proceed
Get my Money up to speed where theres working a nine to five producing an rapping and selling weed
Fellas I  want you to be straight up have you ever took your broad somewhere
And she cut up get to accuse you to looking at the next bitches butt
Knowing she a slut when my mouth’s on her then what then
And eighteen wheeler truck see relationships go wrong and its a fact
Over insecurities and communication gaps but I ain't gonna lie not only women but us hustlers
Get a little jealous accuse our bros of licking at other brother guess thats just nature
But I can deal with ignorant shit baby like getting all in my face and talking crazy BITCH

[Chorus:]
I can do without you alright (without you ) all right
I can do without you (without you ) better
I can do without you (without you  ) all right
I can do without you (without you )

[Verse 2:]
Uhh its bad enough I'm out here funking with the other side w
Why you be thinking I be wanting you to drive in case they pull up on the side
Imma bust them with my  banger stop em in they tracks turn they right into a pasta string
Far as the homies I don't need no dead weight with no goals in they life
They try to get no cake. theres a lotta  phony people out there
Yes they are instead of pulling me to the side like a real one
And having a side bar, you rather say shit about me that you won't say in my face
And If you say it in my face you gon make me catch a case
Thats why I drink wine and smoke herb cuz it relaxes me
I got a temper problem send a sucker to  the mortuary
Far from a fairy this hustle stick to the script b some of these guys got bitch weights but they suspect yea
Its a different world now they doing anything
A lot of these sposed to be called gangstas get in jail and sing
But I remain silent like potato salad what
Is it if I go to the pen imma marry my broad on the strength of conjugal business
Speaking of my broad let me get back on the top if we gon be together
Then we gon be together but all that extra shit stop it cuz bitch

[Chorus:]
I can do without you (without you ) all right
I can do without you (without you ) boy 2:42
I can do without you (without you) girl o yea
I can do without you (without you )

[Bridge:]
Shes always in my hair (in my hair )
I turn around and she’s right there ( she right there )
She says that shes the one for me
(She say that she the one ) I just respond with baby please ( baby please )
I can do without you ( without you )

[Chorus:]
Bitch
I can do without you (without you ) all right
I can do without you (without you) better
I can do without you (without you ) allright
I can do without you (without you)
