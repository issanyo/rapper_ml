[Intro: 2Pac]
Picture me rollin' (rollin', rollin', rollin')

Yeah, clear enough for ya? (that right)
(Hahahahaha) Yeah
(Hehe) Why niggas look mad (that right)
Y'all supposed to be happy, I'm free!
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail, hahah!
Hoe bustaz

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Picture me rollin' in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance
That's what somebody be tellin'
Know there's dope bein' sold, but I ain't the one sellin'
Don't want to be another number
I got a fuckin' gang of weed to keep from goin' under
The Federales wanna see me dead
Niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by my bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shootin' at your crib
Mama, I'm still thuggin', the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just schemin' on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossin' a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beatin'
And my hands is swollen
Thinkin' of the G's I'll be holdin', picture me rollin'

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
When I'm rollin' you will know it's me
Trust me, I'm cruising down the block in my Fleet
Rollin' with two bros, down for the dulos
This is how us gangstas roll
Picture me rollin' (Picture me rollin')
When I'm rollin', they be hating on me
Hiding in the cut contemplating on me
Wanting my ride, wanting my dough
Test and I'll blast fa sho
Forever I'm rollin'

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
I'm just tired of all the games, people coming in packs
Just looking for a reason to try to jack
I got my hand on the squeezer, Young Ebenezer
I got rashes to spread, Leukemia, Emphysema
Out the barrel of the .44, I'm on fire like a fever
I'm a gangsta, my woman is a diva
A brand new S-Class on the low we dippin' past
Niggas mad at me, yeah, they hating gladly
But all I want you to do is just watch me
As I'm rolling by, dippin', getting high
Me and Soopafly super-duper fly getting super high
Ready for a ride, won't you get inside
Brand new twisters on the feet with the beat
Just bumping down the street with nothing but weed
It's just a bomb ass day (day), but niggas still upset
I don't know why, but mama just forgive me
If I have to blow this thing out and then send semis up the steps
I don't want to leave you alone, but see, it's me or him
All I'm trying to say is it's either me or him
Me, I'm trying to do what I do without seeing the pen
Just rollin' (rollin', rollin')

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
When I'm rollin' you will know it's me
Trust me, I'm cruising down the block in my Fleet
Rollin' with two bros, down for the dulos
This is how us gangstas roll
Picture me rollin' (Picture me rollin')
When I'm rollin', they be hating on me
Hiding in the cut contemplating on me
Wanting my ride, wanting my dough
Test and I'll blast fa sho
Forever I'm rollin'

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
When I'm rollin' you will know it's me
Trust me, I'm cruising down the block in my Fleet
Rollin' with two bros, down for the dulos
This is how us gangstas roll
Picture me rollin' (Picture me rollin')
When I'm rollin', they be hating on me
Hiding in the cut contemplating on me
Wanting my ride, wanting my dough
Test and I'll blast fa sho
Forever I'm rollin'
