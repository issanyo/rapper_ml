(Butch Cassidy talking)

[Warren G]
Take notes young locs, I advise y'all to slow down
Glocks, K's, and Eagles trying to put a murder down
Watching fools servin' clowns
With your eyes on the prize, hitting switches
And getting bitches with plenty riches
And if you bang homie, do that
But when your ass gets slapped with that 25, handle that
And all you see is the glamor and gold
Don't know the other side of the game is where it's scandalous and cold
Your destiny is in your hands, you got control
Wasting time with your life until your ass is old
Trying to be bold, a hog and a pimp
Eighteen years old, HIV and a limp

[Hook: Butch Cassidy]
Careful of what you ask for
Sometimes you just should let go
Get what you need and not want
Some folks believe and some don't
These are the ones that don't last
Hard head makes a soft ass
But it was something that I had to have
I just had to have

[WC]
Whats crackin' youngsta
Little OG sick with it
Bangin loose Dickies sagging, house shoe kicking it
Blaze with me, nigga let me swing with you
Hop in the cut dog, and spit this game to ya
I see them niggas have got you tatted and caught in a pattern
Of clutching a Glock, and banging on niggas at the bus stop
Putting in work, in your Pro Club white shirt
Doing dirt trying to gain stripes for the turf
But loc, what up, shit I knew your brother
Used to bang with him, when you was a little motherfucker
Until they amputated both of my legs, circled the block
Caught your brother slippin' and filled him with lead
The retaliation was swift, furious, and just know this hood shit is serious
And for the sake of his memories, see about your paper
And remember locs, success is the best revenge on these haters, nigga

[Hook]

[WC]
Murder, murder, murder

[Warren G]
I don't wanna die
I'm trying to live, trying to survive
Murder, murder, murder

[WC]
I don't wanna die
I'm trying to live, trying to survive
Niggas have got the game twisted
Yet if these busters pump 'em up
And distort their vision, fool listen
Life is like a crap shot
You can either hit the jackpot
Stack a knot and get your cap shot

[Warren G]
Live you life homie, do that
But don't get pumped up to dump and get cracked
And moms put a block on the phone
You's a hard motherfucker, now you all alone

[WC]
All alone in the streets it was on
But keep the leather for penitentiary friends gone
Your on your own

[Warren G]
And to the youth, I spit to you
They call me G Dub and I spit the truth

[Hook]
