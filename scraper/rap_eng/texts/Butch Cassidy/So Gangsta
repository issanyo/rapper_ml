[Verse 1]

On my block, I handle my G business every day
I hustle, on the streets I do it the old fashioned way
I roll out, with some girls that's from the hood
They love me that's understood
And we burn trees that's so good, damn, we, should
Daily, I stay G'd up with my khakis and my Con
Verse, then I pick up my true dogs and bend the curb
That's gangsta, gotta grab a fresh pro club
Now I'm fitted up like a thug
And my Chrysler on two dubs, plus, G'd, up
I keep it gangsta fo' sho', because it's all that I know
The only way that I roll, the only way that I'll flow I'm so

[Hook]

So gangsta, I'm so, so gangsta
So gangsta, so gangsta, we are, I'm sooooooo
So gangsta, so gangsta, so gangsta
So gangsta, so gangsta, bye far

[Verse 2]

LBC, That's what I represent that's where I was born and raised
213, Pay homage to them my dogs they paved the way
Pass the torch, It was beautiful what they've done
Now it's stop get off G funk, but it's my time get it done
I, love, one, you gangsta
They all know, my flow, makes time do's I kill a doe
Wankster, Never sold, let it go, fall up, I got to you know
Oooowwww much of the intellect so severe
Street, Baby come near, let 'em all know that I'm here
No, more, these

[Hook]

So gangsta, I'm so, so gangsta
So gangsta, so gangsta, we are, I'm sooooooo
So gangsta, so gangsta, so gangsta
So gangsta, so gangsta, bye far

[Verse 3]

Think of me when you think of G's
I make the type of music that you wanna get deep with
Its like a gangsta party all life long
Now committed to the streets and get you layman's on
I keep it gangsta fo' sho', because it's all that I know
The only way that I roll, the only way that I'll flow I'm so

[Hook X2]

So gangsta, I'm so, so gangsta
So gangsta, so gangsta, we are, I'm sooooooo
So gangsta, so gangsta, so gangsta
So gangsta, so gangsta, bye far
