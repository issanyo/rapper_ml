[Verse 1: Crooked I]
L-O-N-G, B-E-A-C-H
Tomato juice coupe, and the engine's V8
Warren G and Snoop paved the way for me to create
Like R.I.P Nate, nigga I just wanna be great
I don't even see hate, I'm like the Dali Lama
But I got the 40 cal if you're wantin' some Cali drama
On my mama, I'd rather be chillin' on the beach front
With a bad bisexual bitch that like to eat cunt
You ain't nothin' like a boss, you a street punk
It's C.O.B slash G-Funk
And Crooked got plenty grind, turn pennies, dimes and nickels
To a hundred, if a hater don't see him when he shine then he blind
Gimme mine and run it, to the finish line
I got the semi 9 any time you want it, Cali
Best hurry, more money, less worry
It's Golden State, I stay on point like Steph Curry

[Hook: Butch Cassidy]
California sunshine, [?]
[?] out here on the West side
No place I'd rather be
White tees and khakis is all I see
Real G's, you know, street flow
Set trippin' out here, take caution when you do a show
It's just the Cali way
This the every day life, this side don't change

[Verse 2: Warren G]
The streets got love from 2-1
To wherever the fuck you from, turn it up, let your speakers bump
What's up? Cali, what's up? Cali
I came a long way from servin' 'em in the alley
From Wallabee's to Stacy's
We used to gangbang in the '80's, now we rollin' Mercedes
It's crazy, Long Beach is the city that raised me
213, killas that made me
Flip a switch, hit the hydraulic drum, make that shit jump
Hit it once, hit it twice, make that shit jump
[?] through the hood by they self, niggas get jumped
If you don't watch yourself, you might get slumped
We got the old school ride with the chromed out inside
Lowrider bikes is slim but the rims wide
26 inches, gator seats
Turn ladies to freaks, get 'em all we in their seats, Cali

[Hook: Butch Cassidy]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
I'm on my Californ-i-a shit, grindin'
Paint drippin' down Atlantic Avenue, spaceship glidin'
My city don't make suckas, no, chrome face thumper
I got home base covered, ain't shit slidin'
I pull it out and nobody moves
My niggas been bangin' since the era of them jheri curls and karate shoes
I dropped out of school, still I prolly would prolly do
Slingin' Oxycontins before you were plottin' molly moves
Yeah, baby girl I'm your best look
From the home of the best kush
Nigga, shoppin' carts, nigga, baby strollers
I don't care, I'm down for whatever the fuck the West push
Haters hate, let their mouths move
Don't make me show up to the Grammy's this year in a pair of house shoes
Bang your favorite entertainment while I'm lowridin'
Ass jacked up, nose divin'
It's Cali, nigga
