[Nate Dogg:]
I Don't know about tomorrow
Who can say what it brings
I do know that it's Christmas (know that it's Christmas)
And I can remember the joy that Christmas brings
[Butch Cassidy:]
What better day to spend with your family
Bring your present we'll trade
Little children around me
Since we're gathered here together won't you help me sing (help me sing!)

[Chorus:]
Fa la la la la la laaaa fa lalalalaaaa
Fa la la la la la laaaa fa lalalalaaaa (oooohewooo)
Fa la la la la la laaaa fa lalalalaaaa (noooow)
Be Thankful for the gifts your receive (yeeaaaah)
[Butch Cassidy:]
Blessed are those who receive
All of their Christmas dreams
I can't complain
And I'm hoping that's the way it remains
[Nate Dogg:]
(all the pain) all of the pains life brings
Sometimes we need to sing
'Till the day we finally leave
Together if you sing along, the pain will ease! (ease the pain)

[Chorus:]
Fa la la la la la laaaa fa lalalalaaaa (today)
Fa la la la la la laaaa fa lalalalaaaa (oooohewooo)
Fa la la la la la laaaa fa lalalalaaaa (noooow)
Be Thankful for the gifts your receive (yeeaaaah)

[bridge: Nate Dogg]
Be Thankfuuuuul (everyday of your lives)
Be Thankfuuuuul (give thanks)

Be Thankful for the gifts you receive! (yeeeaaahhh)
[Nate Dogg:]
This morning I woke up with a reason to (falalalalala) sing (reason)
This morning I woke up, to an ugly (falalalalala) Christmas Tree (come on)
This morning I woke up, (falalalalala) no presents were there for me
But This morning I woke up and could breeeeeeath!! (need to learn to thank him don't we)

[bridge (over first Chorus): Nate Dogg]
Be Thankfuuuuul (I don't feel the pain no more)
