[Verse 1]

Come on baby, my girl might call, so there ain't no time to stall
I'm kinda nervous, took my phone out of service so I won't receive a call
I'm on the edge, better yet i'm on the ledge, and to my girl I made  a pledge
Now it's broken, there ain't no time for joking
Girl, we jump right off to bed
I'm lookin funny? This time I want the honey lets start off with a kiss
You don't like it? You feel you wanna hike it?
Then girl you are dismissed!
But, you're still here baby girl, come here and please don't ever fear
Come closer, pour out Mimosa
The Situation is Severe!

[Hook]
I want
You Girl
I want
You Girl

[Verse 2]
I took a chance, so girl I can advance
To the place I wanna be
No need to worry, but yes i'm in a hurry
So girl can we proceed?
You understand, pretty sure you have a man
If you don't it fits my plan
(Girl it fits my plan!)
To keep you mine, even though you can't shine
It will all work out in time!
We havin' fun, yes it's just begun
And we're so far from done
I want it all, when I call, and man we'll have a ball
(I'll let you ride)
I'll let you ride if you let me come outside
Baby girl can't be denied
(Girl can't be denied)
I'm okay as long as I get away with this dime piece by my side

[Hook]
I want
You Girl (I, I, I, I)
I want
You Girl

[Bridge (2x)]
Oooooh
Oooh Oooh
Oooooh
Oooh Oooh

Ain't no girl like the girl I got
If i'm caught, I might get shot
Put it all on the line for you
Cuz no one knows all the things you do
Short time in the day cuz I, (cuz I)
Go home to my lady at night (at night)
You may feel how I deal just ain't right
Don't even worry it's mine!
