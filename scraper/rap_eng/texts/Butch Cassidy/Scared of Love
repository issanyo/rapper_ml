[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I'm just a man
I'm just a man
I'm just a man
I'm just a man scared of love

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
When they asked me
Why I don't like love
Or why I don't have a lady
Maybe its because I know
As soon as I tell her
How I feel about her
As soon as I act like
I love her she's gone

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I'm just a man (scared of love)
I'm just a man (is why I don't have a lady)
I'm just a man
I'm just a man in love

[Verse 2: Butch Cassidy]
I really was so into you
But you don't know what I'm going through
You say you really care for me
But in love there's no guarantee
So, I think I outta take my time
'Cause love ain't no friend of mine you see
Don't let me get you too confused
You're the friend I don't want to lose
If I made a choice it's you I choose
But my heart's a tad bit through
So, I try to get you off my mind
But a remedy I cannot find for you

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I'm just a man (scared of love)
I'm just a man (is why I don't have a lady)
I'm just a man
I'm just a man in love

[Verse 3: Butch Cassidy & Nate Dogg]
I'm never gonna try to find
Another I'm just out for mine
I left so many far behind
But traces they'll never find
No, I can cover all my tracks (all my tracks)
Won't be nothing gettin' back to you
Now don't think that I'm being rude
Because I won't commit to you
And other women want to screw
What's a player supposed to do
So, I'll be slippin' on my hat
I won't be bringin nothing back to you

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I'm just a man (scared of love)
I'm just a man (that's why I don't have a lady)
I'm just a man
I'm just a man in love
I'm just a man (scared of love)
I'm just a man (that's why I don't have a lady)
I'm just a man
I'm just a man in love
