[Verse 1: Mystikal]
Oh bitch I'm country as cowboy boots
I debut beating boy band groups
Nigga let me know what the fuck y'all wanna do
Either keep up or you can't (can't)
Mildew or barbecue, crack or do your thang, dang
I ain't come here for no dumb shit
You tell me which one is the hardest nigga
Lyrics or the drum kick
And when it's finished over and done with
I'ma smoke a blunt and knock the pussy off of some bitch
I ain't no speedy, you say I beat it too much
I ain't gone eat it, you ain't gone drown me, and I pound it enough
See me leaving with a big butt woman
With me, walking funny, pussy up in her stomach
Sittin' in the front cause T.V.'s running
Peanut-butter leather seat, with Big Truck on it
I must've kidnapped her, the nigga man-hunting
Cause I heard him hollering, "Hold on baby I'm coming!!!"

[Hook: Butch Cassidy]
We hushed those who never thought we would get this far
(Baby, I'm comin')
(I'm coming baby!)
But bitch I told you (Tarantula)
So do what you're supposed to (Tarantula)
Give me brains, stop looking strange, bitch, shit changed
It's just like I told you (Tarantula)
Came up like I'm supposed to (Tarantula)

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
And I'm known as the Black Prince of the South
So wop-bop-a-loo-bop, bitch watch out
I make your momma shake her tail feather
Don't tell your daddy that I'm here, because you know I make him feel threatened
Go get your sexy dress to turn me on
While he down there quoting Betty Wright, "I know you not gon' sing that song!!!"
I hit the chart and never move off
Or homie cool off
Before your nose looks like Rudolph's
I give it to him and this bitch can't handle it
Old ugly, jealous, mother-fucker, this shit jammin'
Ridiculous amounts of raw uncut talent
On top of bass, strings, kicks, and piano
They callin' me big bucks, no whammies
This year I'm screaming, "Jive Records, Big Truck," got dammit
Heads up, tighten up, a nigga move
Ranked CEO/Rapper/Fool

[Hook: Butch Cassidy]

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
I'm fixin' to blow up like the jaws of Dizzy Gillespie
Heavens to Betsy
Julio Iglesias couldn't out rock me, Speedy Gonzales couldn't come catch me
Grammy-nominated, especially
The Soul Train Award winner, call me Black Elvis Presley
You probably can't keep up with what you've seen me on
Either 106 & Park, Queen Latifah, Chris Rock, or Jenny Jones
I knock down buildings, and chop down trees
I kick so fucking hard they say, "You Japanese?"
I'm up in the millions because of what I invent
Look at you, over there with your seat belt light on approaching y'all initial decent
A.k.a The Tarantula
Hot rhymes coming from a canister
They keeping my fans for something to brag on
These peoples in here ain't leaving until I finish my fucking last song
Bitch, walk like a Barbarian
Tall, dark and cut, I keep them fucking hoes starin'

[Hook: Butch Cassidy]
