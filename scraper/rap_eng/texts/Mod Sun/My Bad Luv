[Intro]
My bad, bad, bad, bad love
My bad, bad, bad, bad love
I might, I might
I might..

[Verse 1]
I might be on some fuck shit sometimes
Get caught up in that bullshit sometimes
Fuck around and tell a lie to you sometimes
Sometimes, I might, I might
I might pull up on you, droptop, yeah I
Call that mayo with the hot sauce inside
Hit that switch and I go skrrrt on you every time

[Chorus]
Sometimes I might, I might, oh girl
Don't mess with me, I'm full of bad luck
Ain't ever gonna give you what you want
I'm only gonna fuck you up
My bad, bad, bad, bad love
My bad, bad love
My bad, bad, bad, bad love
My bad, bad love
My bad, bad, bad, bad love
My bad, bad, bad, bad love

[Verse 2]
I might, I might
I might be on some selfish shit sometimes
With my new girl, hit my old bitch all the time
Delete the text, I swear to God my girl a spy
Sometimes, I might, I might
Pushin' horses, feel like Polo when I'm riding' by
These ain't horses, this that rare shit you can't buy
Hit that... and I go skrrrt on you every time
Sometimes I might, I might, oh girl

[Chorus]
Sometimes I might, I might, oh girl
Don't mess with me, I'm full of bad luck
Ain't ever gonna give you what you want
I'm only gonna fuck you up
G-give you what you want
G-give you what you want
G-give you what you want
G-give you want you want
You are my bad, bad, bad, bad love
My bad, bad love
My bad, bad, bad, bad love
My bad, bad love
My bad, bad, bad, bad love
My bad, bad, bad, bad love

[Outro]
My bad, bad, bad, bad love
My bad, bad, bad, bad love
My bad, bad, bad, bad love
My bad, bad, bad, bad love
My apologies, I'm sorry, babe
