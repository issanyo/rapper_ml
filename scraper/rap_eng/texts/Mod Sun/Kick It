[Mod Sun]
Mod Sun, All I need is a minute
Everything I talk about, you know that I live it
Everything I thought about, you know I'm 'bout to get it
My style is terrific, don't gotta get specific
We teaching lessons 'bout days of no stressing
This that real feel good anti-depressant
Sounding like the future but I'm living in the present
Everything a miracle, I'm lookin' like a blessing
Mentality to reality
I kept my eyes on the dreams not the salary
And I won't quit until my art up in a gallery
And now there ain't no other place that I would rather be
I'm sayin, I stay myself I ain't never gotta change up
So hold me down on my way up, Mod Sun

[Goody Grace]
Bass up, this is how we kick it
Let it all out, Let the drummer get wicked
Hands up, let the music vibe
Free up your thoughts and let it all slide

We never gonna stress until the end of our days
So hands up, let the music vibe
Free up your thoughts and let it all slide
And let the drummer get wicked
Cause this is how we kick it

[KR]
This is how we kick it
This is how we kick it
Probably fuck a bitch, but I'd never give her my digits
Live my own life and I never follow specifics
Eating all these rappers, when I'm full, you do the dishes
I'm ridin' all the time
With my bros, with my woes, with my hoes
I get two of those, and you get none of those
Never frontin' though
Never on my shit, I do my own thing
Papa used to ride the caddy with the pinky ring
And mama always kept it fly with designer things
Hey-Oh
You don't know where my brain go, with all these bad songs
I'mma find my way-ay, ay-ay-ay, though
I'mma find my way though


[Goody Grace]
Bass up, this is how we kick it
Let it all out, Let the drummer get wicked
Hands up, let the music vibe
Free up your thoughts and let it all slide

We never gonna stress until the end of our days
So hands up, let the music vibe
Free up your thoughts and let it all slide

Free up your thoughts and let it all slide
