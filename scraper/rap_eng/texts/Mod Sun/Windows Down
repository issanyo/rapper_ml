(Verse 1)
Sun always shinin inside my head so, let’s go!
Yeah you control that shit my dude incase you, didn’t know!
The weather never affect my mood or the way I roll
They sayin “live fast die fun”, i’m sayin “never die & burn slow!”

Ch-CH-Chillin on the ocean like a breeze
Catch me in flip flops & tank top even when my city freeze
I’m talkin surfin when the snow fall
Better yet theres none at all
So roll ya windows down
And play it pl-play it loud!

(Chorus)
It’s stormin’ we still got our windows down. (x3)
There ain't nothin fuckin’ with my mood my dude, so be cool

(Verse 2)
I’m mad tropical
Off topic yet topical
My chi sits closer
To the equator than the Galapagos
Ii's like I basically
Made the smile audible
And a successful business-minded
Hippy-type probable
A real animal
Past far-out & radical
Have visions of the top
So I keep inside my optical
Swoop an Optimo
Fill it up with that medical
Than hop on a lowrider bicycle
And watch them fuckin’ pedals go!

(Chorus)
It’s stormin’ we still got our windows down. (x3)
There ain't nothin fuckin’ with my mood my dude, so be cool

(Verse 3 by Shwayze)
Yo this may sound stupid
But I feel like a buddhist
Accept for me I found peace
In the beat & the booty
Somethin like a movie
Picture-esque truly
Blondes wanna do me
Cause they think my song’s groovy
Got the system down & the windows up
I said it backwards cause i’m fucked up!
Well baby tell me do you really wanna hook up?
