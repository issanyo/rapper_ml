[Chorus]
She don't always sing this song, but
She just wanna dance, dance
She don't always sing this song, but
She just wanna dance, dance
She don't know the name of the song, but
She just wanna dance
She don't know the name of the song, but
She just wanna dance, dance

[Verse 1]
She ain't like them other girls who dance to every song, no
She ain't like them other girls who always sing along, no
She that type of girl, nobody like that girl
Type of girl to take over the motherfucking world
And she had long nights, she had early mornings
It goes on and on, yeah, she got her own story
She got her own things, big goals and gold rings
She got (What?) that Kate Moss in Supreme tee type of thing
I'm asking name, sign, age, type
What you tryna do tonight?
I got everything you like
Tryna smoke, I got the light
Got me thinking double time
Jump up in the ride, got her by my side
Good vibes when we driving, you one of a kind
I put that shit on my life

[Chorus]
She don't always sing this song, but
She just wanna dance, dance
She don't always sing this song, but
She just wanna dance, dance
She don't know the name of the song, but
She just wanna dance
She don't know the name of the song, but
She just wanna dance, dance

[Verse 2]
She ain't like them other girls that go out to the club, no
She ain't like them other girls in the bathroom doing drugs, no
No, she that type of girl, might just wife that girl... Hold up
I mean, real shit, what, I really like this girl
God damn, how she do it like a movie
When she move it, playing cool, she see through it
What a sight, what a night
Fuck all them, just be mine
I'm in love with your vibe, ah yeah
I put that shit on my life

[Chorus]
She don't always sing this song, but
She just wanna dance, dance
She don't always sing this song, but
She just wanna dance, dance
She don't know the name of the song, but
She just wanna dance
She don't know the name of the song, but
She just wanna dance, dance
