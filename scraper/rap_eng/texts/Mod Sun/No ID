[Verse 1: Hi-Rez]
You ever dance with the devil in the middle of the winter
My [?] in December, happy nieces [?] memory
Up and coming the enemy, taking over by entities
I don't think that they carefully throwin' up from the Hennessy
And bars, i'll jump in front of a car at the height of my career just to die, fuck a start
Know one thing in this life is hard, but it is
The industry took my chick, it took all my inner peace and took all of my innocence
And maybe already paranoid and made me fucking arrogant
It's self-conscious [?] imma get hella lit
I need to learn to channel my anger, social anxiety
Everyone got an eye on me, everyone relying on me
I don't think i'll ever find love, and imma die lonely
Look up to the sky homie, plain god staring back
Music pushing away all my loved ones, how unfair is that? If happiness is really a thing, then show me where its at

[Chorus]
I got a good side, but lately evil previals
And fuck I look like, bitch not a personal fail
And run my hood right, ain't no person working hard as me
Under agent, bitch they never caughted me
(No ID, Bitch I got no ID, Bitch I got no ID, Bitch I got no ID)

[Verse 2: MOD SUN]
Nah no, MOD SUN, ay ay
Have you walked with a smile and with each and every mile that walk through every day, like a man not a child
And all my own style stay wild while the rest toned down just to fit the profile
When i got into the peak, gotta peak at what I didn't wanna be
And sneak back into the valley and the place that they can see
All the visions i'm giving, do what i'm wishing
I changed my position, i'm positive living
Now everybody want a piece, of a masterpeice
Rolling to a different beat, and different strategy
Manage [?]
So why you mad at me?
Off the top, guillotine, everything I said, I mean
Rez and me, No ID, bleeding out poetry, doing this solo but no we ain't lonely
Every night what I lack, i'm gonna take it home with me
[?] be preaching my words so holily, it's MOD SUN

[Chorus]
I got a good side, but lately evil previals
And fuck I look like, bitch not a personal fail
And run my hood right, ain't no person working hard as me
Under agent, bitch they never caughted me
(No ID, Bitch I got no ID, Bitch I got no ID, Bitch I got no ID)

[Verse 3: Hi-Rez]
I gave my soul to this fuckin' music industry, no turning back
Lost the only girl that I loved for fifteen fuckin' stacks
Doing the fuckin' running man, ain't nobody understand, once an artist falls off there ain't a chance of coming back
I think i'm going wild, I feel like I lost a child, feel like a daughter [?]
Forgot what its like to smile and actually fucking mean it
I wanna wake up from this nightmare, i'm sick of living my dreams
This life is not what it seems, matter fact, it's the opposite, you think bitches, money and drugs is just the awesomest
All these wack rappers do stupid shit, and you follow with them
Sick of this fuckin' world, I can't wait for the apocalypse
Wanna be Lady Gaga rich
I shoulda' been anonymous when making fuckin' music so ain't nobody would bother me
I'm owing everybody a fuckin' [?] apology, for being so distant and cold-hearted, i'm being honest

[Chorus]
I got a good side, but lately evil previals
And fuck I look like, bitch not a personal fail
And run my hood right, ain't no person working hard as me
Under agent, bitch they never caughted me
(No ID, Bitch I got no ID, Bitch I got no ID, Bitch I got no ID)
