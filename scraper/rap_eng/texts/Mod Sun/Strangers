She said 'normally I don't get in bed with strangers'
I said 'but girl, you just saw me upon that stage'and
I'm coming back to your city, just be patient
Run with it and come up to it where my base it

On her comforter, I'm contemplating whether or not to get up so faded
Hair down on her back is braided, staring at the scraps she made
Caught her like an ulcer, head it for the out view, with the facts I gave her
Gained her trust in a day, not a bad exchange for the facts I rated
She get tied up, she wants, she bouncing off the wall
She wired like a generation, off of adderall
But that's how I'm functioning at 4AM and the company
Is standing in the illuminated door framing with a tie for me
So divine, give her room to burn
She can take it all she wants but she gotta wait her turn
I'll be gone early in the morning, will she ever learn?
Probably not, she probably won't
I straight attack this shit like I want it
Get inside every crack in the corner
Already ran two laps is a bonus
Where she's from and where she's going
I don't need that information, just a little smile and a good vibration
That temptation, reputation, my eyes in a thousand, rejoicing
I want a cosmic silver lining, only look once, it was another fine day
Bring her to the show, at the CD signing
Girl, they came to me, you don't see me trying
Twelve rounds on the table, don't see me buying

She said 'normally I don't get in bed with strangers'
I said 'but girl, you just saw me upon that stage'and
I'm coming back to your city, just be patient
Run with it and come up to it where my base it


If you see me in your city say 'what's up, my hippie?' MOD SUN
If you see me in your city say 'what's up, my hippie?'
Every day a new city, every night a new town
If you tell em bout the hippie, then you're about to get down
Cause we're drinking by the case then we're puffing by the pound
Cause you got to get lost if you tryna get found
So, what's up my stranger? I can treat you like you're in danger
I'm tryna chill with you later, so here's the number to my pager
She was feeling me and my flavour, let her be free, don't gotta cage her
She knows I ain't tryna date her so I took control like invader and
This for the freshman living like a senior
I see it, those features like beaches, what a creature, gotta meet you
Gotta please you, just gotta, gotta, uh
I knew I had her but I still hit her with the stare
Only took two time I could spare, I'm so obviously rare
Now we're off to have an affair, forget the truth, we're choosing dare
Sunny and Reves came up in here, so we gonna put one in the air
Cause in the AM we back on the road again
And when we come back I know that she'll be waiting and be patient

She said 'normally I don't get in bed with strangers'
I said 'but girl, you just saw me upon that stage'and
I'm coming back to your city, just be patient
Run with it and come up to it where my base it


She said 'normally I don't get in bed with strangers'
I said 'but girl, you just saw me upon those stages'
I'm coming back to your city, just be patient
Run with it and come up to it where my base it

I could, I could, yeah, yeah
