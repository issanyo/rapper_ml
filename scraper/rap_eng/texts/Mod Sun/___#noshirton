[Chorus]
No shirt on, head hanging out the window
Feeling myself, baby, you know how the shit go
Now I'm getting so high, riding like she so low
No shirt on, head hanging out the window

[Verse 1]
I got tats on my chest, gotta let that shit show
Yes I am happy to be here, that's just how I feel
I got enough energy for this whole damn world
I can change the color of your mood ring just like, woah
I got, I got, I got a lot of plans to change a lot
I got some thoughts about the way they making us, and so
Goddamn dangerous, become an activist
I might save us all, in Mod we trust

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma buy a hippy bus, fill that thing up with some kush
Spread love not lust, so
I'm goin' to woodstock or bust
There's only one way to roll with us

[Chorus]
No shirt on, head hanging out the window
Feel myself, baby, you know how the shit go
Now I'm getting so high, riding like she so low
No shirt on, head hanging out the window
No shirt on, head hanging out the window
Feeling myself, baby, you know how the shit go
Now I'm getting so high, riding like she so low
No shirt on, head hanging out the window

[Bridge]
No shirt on, head hanging out the window
Hair blowing in the wind, blonde as a bimbo
Always got a smile, that's a permanent dimple
Why you make so hot look so simple?

[Verse 2]
When you gonna get the hint though?
You could be the one to solve all your issues
Who give a fuck if they diss you?
But y'all misuse tissues, you see
I only cry tears of joy
I got some mouths to feed, some friends to employ
It's starting to annoy me
Every time I hear somebody in my ear bringing bad vibes near

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma buy a hippy bus, fill that thing up with some kush
Spread love not lust, so
I'm goin' to woodstock or bust
There's only one way to roll with us

[Chorus]
No shirt on, head hanging out the window
Feeling myself, baby, you know how the shit go
Now I'm getting so high, riding like she so low
No shirt on, head hanging out the window
No shirt on, head hanging out the window
Feeling myself, baby, you know how the shit go
Now I'm getting so high, riding like she so low
No shirt on, head hanging out the window
