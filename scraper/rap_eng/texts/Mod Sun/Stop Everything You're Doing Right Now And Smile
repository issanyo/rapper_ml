Verse 1: [MOD SUN]                                                                                 Back at it with another one
You had me at "I listen to Mod Sun"
And this shit right here though
Will let you know how we roll
I don't care who you be knowing
Or what you created
What school you attended
And how you were graded
Yeah who you grew up with
Or who you just dated
And what you agree with
Or what you debated
You cherished or hated
Different or related
You sober or faded, ya all that
I'm saying is, STOP and SMILE

Chorus: [MOD SUN & Cisco Adler]
Stop everything you're doing right now and smile
Stop everything you're doing right now and smile
Stop everything you're doing right now and smile
Stop everything you're doing right now and smile

Verse 2: [MOD SUN]
See we know that we could be on it
But you know that we got to be honest
Been known to keep every promise and
Its compliments or no comments
I'm a soldier, soldier, there's no limit
Ya I told ya, told ya, I'm so driven
Movin like a Porsche up n down the course
Live with no remorse, I'm the source
Give them mi amore, j'adore
For really kid I be like no other
But at the core we all the same my brotha
So I won't be satisfied until we all
Poppin and I make music in
The key of fuckin awesome!
Now I really do love the way you talk
But everybody stop when the music drop
And SMILE

Chorus: [MOD SUN & Cisco Adler]
Stop everything you're doing right now and smile
Stop everything you're doing right now and smile
Stop everything you're doing right now and smile
Stop everything you're doing right now and smile

Hands up if you could only see right now
Hands up that you got all you need right now and smile
Stop everything you're doing right now and smile
Stop everything you're doing right now and smile

Verse 3: [MOD SUN]
You must have us confused this ain't
A teenage wasteland at all
Cause when I look in front of me
This is what I see, leaders in all a yall
We didn't search for it, it came to us
Have faith in me, in Mod we trust
We on the cusp of lust & positive like
A plus, got a special touch and we never in a rush
I think I'm Andy Warhol, Mark Twain
Martin Luther King, & Alexander McQueen
Maya Angelou, Michelangelo
David Ruffin, Salvador Dali
Freebird screamin drink the kool-aid its
A new day, but hold up wait
And SMILE

Chorus: [MOD SUN & Cisco Adler]
Stop everything you're doing right now and smile
Stop everything you're doing right now and smile
Stop everything you're doing right now and smile
Stop everything you're doing right now and smile

Hands up if you could only see right now
Hands up that you got all you need right now
And Smile
