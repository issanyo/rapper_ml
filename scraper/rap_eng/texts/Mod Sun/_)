[Verse 1: Lil Phag]
It don't really matter if you're drunk or if you're sober
If you pull up in a Maserati or a fucking Toyota
Forget all your problems, we your family for the night
If you tryna let it go, baby this is your night

[Chorus: Lil Phag]
Cause we all getting lit together
Smiles on our face together
You a fucking star baby, I should call the space center
Smile on your face baby, you a fucking star
If you partying with friends or you alone in your car
Put a smile on your face baby, you a fucking star
If you partying with friends or you alone in your car

[Verse 2: Dr. Woke]
Everywhere that I go, I'm spreading posi vibes
When I pull up in the Bimmer I'm so happy I'm alive
It's a blessing when I wake up and go to bed at night
I'm so grateful for my time here, I feel like I can fly

[Chorus: Lil Phag]
We all getting lit together
Smiles on our face together
You a fucking star baby, I should call the space center
Smile on your face baby, you a fucking star
If you partying with friends or you alone in your car
Put a smile on your face baby, you a fucking star
If you partying with friends or you alone in your car

[Verse 3: MOD SUN]
This the night that you've been waiting on for so long
It feels like forever since you had a favorite song
We wrote this for you so right now if riding or driving solo
With your crew on the low though
Smile for the photo
I get [?] never complicating anything around, nothing can phase me
Feel amazing in a new Mercedes [?]
I remember when the world was so dark
Back then days got so hard
Some days I wish [?] now look where we are

[Chorus: Lil Phag]
We all getting lit together
Smiles on our face together
You a fucking star baby, I should call the space center
Smile on your face baby, you a fucking star
If you partying with friends or you alone in your car
Put a smile on your face baby, you a fucking star
If you partying with friends or you alone in your car
Put a smile on your face baby, you a fucking star
If you partying with friends or you alone in your car
Put a smile on your face baby, you a fucking star
If you partying with friends or you alone in your car
