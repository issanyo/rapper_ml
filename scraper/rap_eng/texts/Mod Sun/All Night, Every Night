[Verse 1: MOD SUN]
Ladies and gentlemen we do this all night
Every night
We takin no days off
My name is Mod Sun

We're drinkin heavy, getting wasted
Till we pass out, you passed it my way
And then I blacked out
So next rounds on me until I max out
Cause right now my bank account the last thing that I care about
Yeah time movin' real slow
Got this place smellin' like a Cypress Hill show
Rolled in feelin' like â€”
Meetin' everyone inside but the dress code
Yeah I'm wide awake even though I got my eyes low
I drove us here, but take my keys I ain't gonna drive home
Tryin to take shots but they won't let me no more
But anymore alcohol I think I might hit the floor
Spend my drink and then I'm really did though
You bummed out you're just right out the front door
You said you party to I don't know how to act right
I laughed and said this is all every night

Real ..to be cut in any..
That's right, whatever you..
That night, take a shot, take a..feel good
Yeah I thought she would
So fly cause from the sky you see everything

Chorus:
I'm all night, every night singing
All night, every night singing
All night, this..everything
All night, every night singing
All night, every night singing
All night, just ..everything

Feeling trippy in the city flash full of whisky
Fully fucked up, far past the point of being tipsy
So burnt off this stick it's got me filling crispy
Yeah, my life is so sick, it's got me feeling icky
Cannon ball into a champagne pool
Dive head first into a keg full of brew
Barely remember but I swear it's true
Party like I'm the fifth member of motley crew
This Sour D just got me higher than the ozone
Is 3 am and I ain't ready to go back home
Drunk dialing everybody in my cell phone
You think imma change when I'm well known? HELL NO
And somehow I ended up in a taxi
And all most threw up in the back seat
Dude said you partied too hard, you alright?
I laughed and said this is all night every night
