Yeah
My favorite shirt is my skin
My favorite shirt is my skin
Pretty on the outside and within
Pretty on the outside and within (pretty--pretty on the outside and within)
My favorite shirt is my skin, I'm in love with myself
Every time I look into the mirror (woo!), I melt
My favorite shirt is my skin
My favorite shirt is my skin

[Verse: MOD SUN]
My favorite shirt is my skin, I'm in love with myself
Every flaw is really beauty owned by nobody else
The world will be a better place if this how everyone felt
So until we see that day, I'm here to offer some help
My favorite shirt is my skin, I'm in love with myself
Feelin' sexy ain't determined by the size of your belt
And you look good in that makeup, but I like all natural
I think everyone is beautiful

[Hook: Mod Sun]
My favorite shirt is my skin
My favorite shirt is my skin
Pretty on the outside and within
Pretty on the outside and within (pretty--pretty on the outside and within)
My favorite shirt is my skin, I'm in love with myself
Every time I look into the mirror (woo!), I melt
My favorite shirt is my skin
My favorite shirt is my skin

[Outro]
I think everyone is--is beautiful
Pretty on the outside--and within
I'm in love with myself--one is beautiful
I'm in love with myself
I'm in love with myself
I'm in love with myself
I think everyone is--is beautiful
