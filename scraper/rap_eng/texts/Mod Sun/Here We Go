(Verse 1)
Next in line always working till the sun up
My second try cause the first wasn't in budget
Mix a hippy hopper with a never flip and flopping
Gone steal the show when rip and rocking like we picking pockets
Couple city hoppers, in the land of Knicks and Dodgers
No no no it isn't stopping, got some pretty women jocking
Here we go, never awkward always on my Bobby Barker
Better make proper offer for my handwork or I'm walking
When I started had vision
Yeah been hard like math and physics
Never worried passion pitted
Don't need fame nah have them minutes
Sitting back laugh at living
Never gone or back in business
Homies make my my videos
Reason why I'm camera friendly
Man I'd sign if the price was right
But no way id ever sing if the price meant life
It'd be nice but nice don't mean I'm liking life
So if it not what it seems Imma likely flight

(Hook Adam Case)
Take a shot, take a chance at doing what I love
Without all the romance yeah I'm saying that I'm ready
Here we go, thats what Im saying here we go
Saying that I'm ready Here we go, oh baby here we go

(Verse 2 - Modsun)
How is it that every minute Im sipping something exquisite
This isn't a visit this is how I live, I get it
We take it roll it, blow it, hit it hit and hold in
We golden going to moon this is the one thing we knowing
Ok were taking flight, red eye, west side, we ride, good vibes, tye dye
I be the happiest rapper alive uh huh
And this how we start the night
Living that casino life always rollin dice till we get it right
Im celebrating cause I woke up
Swisher getting split like when a couple get broke up
Puffin on the finest only time you find him choked up
Cleaner than a shower getting soaked up you know us
Im floating so high on the low
Fast lane living never ever take it slow
Yeah my hippy you know that just how we roll
Me and J Sallee can't wait no more so here we go


(Hook Adam Case)
Take a shot, take a chance at doing what I love
Without all the romance yeah I'm saying that I'm ready
Here we go, thats what Im saying here we go
Saying that I'm ready Here we go, oh baby here we go
