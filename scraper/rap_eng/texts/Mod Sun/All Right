These days, go by so fast
They run away
And I know that I drink too much
Yeah, I'm aware I smoke too much
But I don't care

I don't care

So when you see me in the streets
Don't look at me
Like I'm somebody you dont want to be
Cause I'm All Right
All Right (x2)

So meet me in the streets
It's where I'll be
Instead of going down come up with me
And we'll be all right
All right

I know what you say when I'm not there
But I dont care

I know what you say when I'm not there
But I'm not scared

So when you see me in the streets
Don't look at me
Like I'm somebody you dont want to be
Cause I'm All Right
All Right

And I can tell you all the things
That you dont know
But you won't ever understand, no no
And thats All Right (x2)

So when you see me in the streets
Don't look at me
Like I'm somebody you dont want to be
Cause I'm All Right
All Right (x2)

These days, go by so fast
They run away
And I know that I drink too much
Yeah, I'm aware I smoke too much
But I don't care
