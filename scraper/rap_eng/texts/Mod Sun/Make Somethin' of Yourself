[Chorus]
Make somethin' of yourself
Make somethin' of yourself
Make somethin' of yourself
Make somethin' of yourself

[Verse 1]
Look-look-lookin' out the window
Thinking 'bout the shit I been through
Not that other shit I told you
But the shit I never get to
Used to smile for the camera
Always make it look so simple
Sometimes just keeping it together
Seems so fucking monumental
What if, what if, what if crash and I burn?
Maybe I got caught up in teaching and forgot how to learn
What if I let down all my friends
And all this music shit just ends?
And everything's about to fall apart
Just like my father says to me
But my mama say I'll make it
She said, "Boy, you gon' be the greatest"
So part of me, will I become a monster?
I'm giving everything I have to offer
But right now, it feels do or die
Gotta make it out alive
Gotta pay the price that it costs to

[Chorus]
Make somethin' of yourself
Make somethin' of yourself
Make somethin' of yourself
Make somethin' of yourself

[Verse 2]
Not proud of all the things I did
But I'm proud I can admit that
Yes, I was a truly messed up kid
But I blessed up quick, don't forget that
It's a shame my parents had to split
But I had nothing to do with that
Took a while to understand
'Cause I thought love was a gift you don't get back
I guess it all appeared a facade
And that's right around the time I stopped believing in God
Started believing in myself, like I don't need no one else
And whether it was right or wrong at the time
I swear that shit really helped, it did
But all I know is how to keep it moving
They try to stop me, I keep pursuing
I'm moving up like hallelujah
So part of me, will I become a monster?
And overcome everything I encounter
But right now, it feels do or die
Gotta make it out alive
Gotta pay the price that it costs to

[Chorus]
Make somethin' of yourself
Make somethin' of yourself
Make somethin' of yourself
Make somethin' of yourself

[Verse 3]
(Make somethin')
Please just let me make it
Please just grant this wish for me
For granted, I won't take it
I need to make something (Make somethin') of myself
I know I said I didn't believe earlier
But, God, if you're real, I need some help
I need to make something (Make somethin')
More than just money
I thought that was gon' make me happy
It just made me so ugly
I really need to make something (Make somethin')
Some kind of difference
I know I got it inside me, I just hope you'll be my witness
I'm gonna make somethin'

[Outro: Reversed]
I thought it would be easy
But I can't stop thinking about you, yeah
I can't believe those words came out my mouth
