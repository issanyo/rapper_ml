[Hook: G-Eazy]
Ridin through the city, rollin' up sticky
A bad bitch with me and we both getting trippy
Man I'm sippin on brown, 'till I might drown
I'm high and I'm never comin 'down
Stay high all day
Stay high all day
Fuck around and stay high all day
Stay high all day

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Say you love me, is that true?
Told her if it's that real get a tattoo
Maybe this bitch is who I come back to
Maybe this beat is too chill to rap to
Riding with Bonita smoking reefer
She ain't heard of you I ain't heard of you neither
Blowin' up gettin money and they hate it
No job so I'm chillin' gettin faded
Think I'm 'bout to go pick up a zippy I'm just -

[Hook: G-Eazy]
Ridin through the city, rollin' up sticky
A bad bitch with me and we both getting trippy
Man I'm sippin on brown, 'till I might drown
I'm high and I'm never comin 'down
Stay high all day
Stay high all day
Fuck around and stay high all day
Stay high all day

[Verse 2: Mod Sun]
And now I'm floatin' over my city, rollin' up sticky
Got a gypsy with me and we both gettin' trippy (trippy mane)
Bouta face a whole bot and then refill the roach quickly
Seal the zag with keef dust, and call that thing pixie
G got me feeling straight up, out the 50's
You would think our life is made up, itâ€™s so damn nifty
And I'm lookin' extra spiffy tryin' to get lifty
Step up in the room they giddy throw it back and then we dippy
Been in love with weed since the first time I smelled it
Wanted it for free but karma wouldn't let me sell it
Got my first and only job just so I could afford it
But that didn't fit the schedule of skateboardin' and recordin'
Put my hours in now I got a job tourin'
Where we get free oz's when the land is foreign
(Thank you for that)
It's safe to say that we live that life
All these people keep sayin', "Man it must be nice"
And I'm just -

[Hook: G-Eazy]
Ridin through the city, rollin' up sticky
A bad bitch with me and we both getting trippy
Man I'm sippin on brown, 'till I might drown
I'm high and I'm never comin 'down
Stay high all day
Stay high all day
Fuck around and stay high all day
Stay high all day
