[Intro]
(YO G Money)
Yeah, woah

[Chorus]
I'm so fuckin happy baby, yeah, uh
My whole life, everybody told me that I'm fuckin crazy, huh, yeah, ay
On the first day at school they say what you wanna be boy, I said amazing, (ayy), hah, yeah
Used to flip packs in Mankato
Now I whip down Rodeo on the daily, yeah
I been vibin', I been vibin'
I ain't even fucking tryin', yeah

[Verse 1]
Drop that, watch
Just what I thought
You can still feel the vibe
When there ain't even nothin' going on
I ain't even gotta talk
I let my energy do that for me
Fuck with a compliment
Fuck with critique
Sometimes I feel like once I went to sleep
And never woke up
I'm just stuck in a
Dreamed that last night I ran off
Went straight to NASA and blast off
I'm movin' faster than Nascar
Skrt skrt skrt skrt
Whatcha think about the way im makin' everything work
Whatcha think about the way i keep it so down to earth
And I'm bouta be this way till they put me in the dirt
I don't keep it undercover
I came from the suburbs
Where we all love herbs
And we pay top dollars
Cold when a hot summer
Some think its a bummer
But I've never been a sucker
I'm a real life thugger
If she got the bad vibes, then I'm probably gonna dump her

[Chorus]
I'm so fuckin happy baby, yeah, uh
My whole life everybody told me that I'm fuckin crazy, huh, yeah, ayy
On the first day at school they say what you wanna be boy, I said amazing, (ayy), hah, yeah
Used to flip packs in Mankato
Now i whip down rodeo on the daily, yeah
I been vibin', I been vibin'
I ain't even fucking tryin', yeah

[Verse 2]
Drop that, okay rap
I'm gonna make 'em run it back
I'm gonna keep 'em comin' back
I'm gonna, I’m gonna, I'm gonna take take all the money I make
Give it away uh huh, have fun with that
All I need in this life of sin is weed and my oxygen (woah)
Why I gotta be so high as shit?
It make me feel confident
Now, puff, puff, pass the piff and don’t crash the whip
My head hangin' out the window, that’s that hip
Yes, I am him, got smile on my lip
Got so many styles and it’s really hard to pick
Not talkin' outfits, but, baby take a picture
Click click click, yuh, my click sicker, yuh
Take another sip, yuh, hit me in the VIP, yuh, always got a zip, yuh, remain to take a hit, yeah
And I don’t keep it undercover
I’m a happy baby
It’s just the way that maybe they told me
I’m crazy, maybe, but I shine, never shady, kind on the daily, to anybody who try to burst my bubble but that (oh) don’t burst
On the contrast, this shit pop when I drop the first verse
So now I got the earth all up on my turf
I’m gon' show 'em how to smile, really work​

[Chorus]
I'm so fuckin happy baby, yeah, uh
My whole life everybody told me that I'm fuckin crazy, huh, yeah, ayy
On the first day at school they say what you wanna be boy, I said amazing, (ayy), hah, yeah
Used to flip packs in Mankato
Now i whip down rodeo on the daily, yeah
I been vibin', I been vibin'
I ain't even fucking tryin', yeah
