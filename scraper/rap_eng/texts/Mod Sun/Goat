[Intro]
She the baddest in the club, that she know (that she know)
She the baddest everywhere that she go (that she go)
You can think you gon' get her, but you won't
She the motherfucking best, she the motherfucking G.O.A.T

[Verse 1]
She look super good but she act super bad
Diamonds on her neck made them bitches mad
She gon' break your neck when she shake that ass
Drop it to the floor, bounce it, bounce it like, like that
I like that and you look like a whole snack
And I'm down to drop a whole track
'Cause you killin' me in that dress
Oh my God

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my, oh my God
How the fuck did I end up next to her in this club?
Oh my God, she got curves
And I bet she swerve anybody tryna say words to her

[Chorus]
She gon' light up every room that she walk in
When she in that bitch, everybody talkin'
You can think you gon' get her, but you won't
She the motherfucking best, she the motherfucking G.O.A.T
She the baddest in the club, that she know (that she know)
She the baddest everywhere that she go (that she go)
You can think you gon' get her, but you won't
She the motherfucking best, she the motherfucking G.O.A.T

[Bridge]
She the G.O.A.T., she the G.O.A.T
She the G.O.A.T., she the G.O.A.T
She the G.O.A.T., she the G.O.A.T
She the G.O.A.T., she the G.O.A.T

[Verse 2]
She so dope, she should be in the fucking centerfold
But she won't, when she walk in the door, everyone frozen
Pussy taste like roses, part the seas like Moses
Good in every photo but that bitch ain't ever posin'
Yeah, that girl be poppin' and she got no plan on stoppin' it
She be steady flossin' in her walk in closet, oh my God
Oh my God

[Pre-Chorus]
How the fuck did I end up next to her in this club?
Oh my God, she got curves
And I bet she swerve anybody tryna say words to her

[Chorus]
She gon' light up every room that she walk in
When she in that bitch, everybody talkin'
You can think you gon' get her, but you won't
She the motherfucking best, she the motherfucking G.O.A.T
She the baddest in the club, that she know (that she know)
She the baddest everywhere that she go (that she go)
You can think you gon' get her, but you won't
She the motherfucking best, she the motherfucking G.O.A.T
