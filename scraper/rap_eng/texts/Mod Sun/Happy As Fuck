If you like vodka or lemonade
If you like sunshine or sittin in the shade
If you like to get paid or you like to get laid
Then you’ve got to understand that you’ve got it made
And you should be happy as fuck

[Verse 1]
I stay happy as a mutha fucka that’s right
Knew I was gonna do a lotta smilin so I brush twice
I throw my hands up in the sky and yell “Hug Life!”
Yeah I can digg it, I can digg it so I dug twice
Today I’m sayin “Hi” to everyone that I see
Until they know me better than my I.D
Tell them all how stoked I am that I’m me
’til they think I got Ecstasy runnin through an IV
I’m sand paper when the times get rough
Alarm clock been ringin man, it’s time to get up!
Barry White the whole world, your love we can't get enough
Cause you’re alive my friend so let’s get high my friend
Look around all this is yours given to you for free
And can’t be bought in stores
You see the present that’s a hell of a gift
I take my glass half full with a twist

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Goin city 2 city, I’mma bring back Hippy
I be ill with the raps and still got pop like Iggy
Takin shots like fifty and stay twistin up Ziggy
No money no problems, we call that a no biggie
It’ll all good baby baby
Follow me follow me up, swallow a cup
Hallow a blunt, time to do whateva you want
It’s on let it begin, time for some good news
Less CNN and watch more cartoons
Aloha my favorite color is tye dye
A stoner and proud of I so why lie?
I changed my life when I met good vibes
And found out the grass is hella green on both sides
So look around all this is yours give to you for free
And can’t be bought in stores
You see the present that’s a hell of a gift
I take my glass half full with a twist like

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Down on ya luck?
Ok I been there
Mad at the world?
Uh huh yup I was once
There was a time I felt like I didn’t care
I was lost and didn’t know who I was
But a couple years ago, I finally figured out
Everything that happens is caused by what you think about
Imagine this, I take my glass half full with a twist
I take my glass half full with a twist

[Hook x2]
