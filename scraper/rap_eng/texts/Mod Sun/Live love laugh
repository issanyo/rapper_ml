"Live Love Laugh"
And I'm just li-li-li-livin on my cottage, such a feelin'
So now we chi-chi-chi chillin' on top of these buildings
It may have took us a minute
But now they can get it
Make this whole world my witness
This shit just work out like fitness
You make a ki-ki-ki killin'
Well that do not sound appealin'
Cause I'm bringing this alive, yeah I'm bringing this alive
Yeah, we like that, like that (That)
Two times if you like that, like that (That)
One time, put it on the line
Do it one more time then come right back
As great as it's gettin'
Never act like a chicken
Tryna soar like the eagles
That's why I don't kick like a pigeon
You people think I be slippin'
But I tell them "Just listen"
They say "kid watch you doing"
I say "shit I'm livin'"
I try and then make
And I'm lost in the rain
But times they will change
But all stay the same
I live for the moments that I don't forget, I don't forget
And I try my hardest to make sure I won't regret, I won't regret
I Live and I Love and I Laugh (I laugh a lot, I laugh a lot)
I Live and I Love and I Laugh (I laugh a lot, I laugh a lot)
And I'm just lo-lo-lo lovin'
Everything I'm becoming
It's been a hell of a journey
I wouldn't trade it for nothin'
I'm yellin' don't stop believin'
To everyone I'm meetin'
All the people at church
You know this hippy be preachin'
Pre-Pre-Pre- Preachin' the meanest
To the filthy and cleanest
All day I dream about success, that's Adidas
One of the wins to the fetus
But not no one came to feed us
You know I am one of a kind
That means I am not a previous
Bradley Nowell told me, Bradley- Bradley Nowell told me
That lovin' is all I got (got, got, got)
So don't be sorry (don't be sorry) Don't be sorry
That lovin' is all you got
I try and then make
And I'm lost in the rain
But times they will change
But all stay the same
I live for the moments that I don't forget, I don't forget
And I try my hardest to make sure I won't regret, I won't regret
I Live and I Love and I Laugh (I laugh a lot, I laugh a lot)
I Live and I Love and I Laugh (I laugh a lot, I laugh a lot)
And I'm just livin' lovin' laughin'
And I'm just livin' lovin' laughin'
And I'm just livin' lovin' laughin'
I live for the moments that I don't forget, I don't forget
And I try my hardest to make sure I won't regret, I won't regret
I Live and I Love and I Laugh (I laugh a lot, I laugh a lot)
I Live and I Love and I Laugh (I laugh a lot, I laugh a lot)
And I'm just livin' lovin' laughin'
And I'm just livin' lovin' laughin'
