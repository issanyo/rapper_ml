This is all I do!

Yeah this is what it sounds like
When someone handcuffs themselves to there work

MOD SUN!
M-O-D S-U-N
Movement On Dreams Stand Under None!

(Chorus)
"Thats the sound of the man
Working on the chain gang
Yeah yeah"

Now put yo hands up!
If you gone make it!
Now put your hands up!
Go head an take it! (x2)

(Verse 1)
Damn I remember when
Nobody was listenin’
Never even got a compliment
Ain't no one watchin him
No pix no need to pose
No shows no videos
Ain't got no classic flows...
Shit that was only like a year ago!
Look at what we’ve done, look what we’ve become
New episode never givin out a re run
Give ya what I got no need for a refund
This right here get ya higher than the reefer
Or higher than Aretha
Don’t do it for the Franklins, Im thinkin
It’s time for a change
That’s what I’m makin
I’m the future “Hi, nice to meet ya”
Woah!
I gave up everything, for my everything
Gave music a wedding ring
Yeah that’s my ball & chain
My stars are alignin, steppin out the backround
Wanna know bout grindin?
Well this is how that sound!

(Chorus)
"Thats the sound of the man
Working on the chain gang
Yeah yeah"

Now put yo hands up!
If you gone make it!
Now put your hands up!
Go head an take it! (x2)

(Verse 2)
Ok I handcuffed
Myself to a mic, got an MPC
Chained to my ankle tight
Keep a pen between my fingers
Answering these questions
A straight pro with the tools
I’m engineering my own sessions
Make it on our time, our clocks
Every A&R in my inbox
Every major label wanna sign me
Trust me there has been talks
Its Hippy Hop & they want more
8 months a the year i’m on tour
They scratch the surface
I’m at the core
And that line proves this is what i’m meant for
And lately in these interviews
They callin us “independent-marketing guru’s”
God damn right the sun is shinin’
With no plans to go down
WANNA KNOW BOUT GRINDIN?
WELL THIS IS HOW THAT SOUND!

(Chorus)
"Thats the sound of the man
Working on the chain gang
Yeah yeah"

Now put yo hands up!
If you gone make it!
Now put your hands up!
Go head an take it! (x2)

(outro)

You gonna make it
Whatever your doing man, keep it movin
