[Verse 3]
I throw up two fingers
I'm colder than two winters
I'm on fire like two sinners
I'm so hungry I need me like two dinners
Too many mentions I might need two twitters
Too many celebrations, I might need me like two livers
Too many got two faces, they hating swear they too bitter
One security ain't enough, crew told me we gonna have to consider getting two...
