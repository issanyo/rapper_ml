Did I Ever Wake Up Chapter 1- REBORN
Everything you are could be everything you were
As I exhaled a rush came over me that I had never imagined
No longer did I taste the recycled air jumping in and out of my lungs
This breath belonged to me for the first time
I could feel the links of every chain that tied me down to reality being broken one by one
This isnt the kind of freedom my president speaks about
This is real
The exhilaration of this foreign feeling had made me utterly oblivious to the fact
That my eyelashes had become hundred pound barbells, determined to deal my eyelids shut
I struggled to form a sentence as the words "
I'm good" dripped out of my mouth, barely making it past my teeth
Had I known this was my last statement, I would have attempted to put it more eloquently
The world as I knew it slowly faded to black as I fell into an infinite slumber
Welcome to the dream
The second you turn that last page is the beginning of your new life
You're just taking your first breath
These are your first thoughts
Congratulations, you've successfully completed the first portion of being you
This is where the fun starts
As of right now, you officially have no past
Everything prior to this moment will no longer be affecting your present in any way
You are now everything you want to pursue
You are every personality trait you admired, and most importantly, you are in charge
I strongly encourage you to act, thing, speak, and participate like never before
However, there are some key ingredients to ensure the success of this new life
You must know what you want
You must believe without a doubt you will obtain it
I understand this can sound somewhat intimidating and I know some people have no idea what they want right now
Well I'm here to let you know that the sooner you figure it out, the better
This includes relationships, occupation, happiness, Heath, financial well-being, and everything in between
You can always add more to the list as you go along, but consider the things you enjoy in life most, and focus on those
Start thinking
You can literally get anything you want if every thought is paired with a sense of affirmation
For example, instead of saying "
I want to be happy", say "
I am happy"
It's all about the act of doing and being in pursuit
It's time to look in the mirror and see everything you desire
It will take imagination and self-control, but we have all been given both those things for free
Let's start the dream
One of my favourite pieces of advice is: If you want a new car, go test drive it
See what it's like to get behind the wheel of your dream car
The smell of the leather, grip of the tires and purr of the engine
Hold these things very close to you
Think about them
The power of new environment
This tool is the compas on the journey to finding yourself
Do new things and go to new places
As a touring musician, I wake up in a new state everyday for months at a time
People who've never seen my face, or heard my me speak constantly surround me
I'm free to allow my chameleon-like soul to take on any desired personality trait
We have no past to those we haven't met
When people don't have a preconceived idea of who we are, we can let go of what we don't want to be and become whomever we intend on being
Sometimes it may become necessary to leave behind people or things that are holding us back from the destiny we are creating
Meeting new people is like a slingshot thrusting you towards this new you
Duce yourself
Just simply say hello
Not too long ago, I redesigned every aspect of my existence
I decided I was going to be the most enjoyable person possible for people to be around
That's where it all started
It was simple
All I had to do was be fun
I'd walk into every room and introduce myself to everyone in it
I'd deliver every handshake with a smile
No matter what, I was going to leave that room with a bunch of new friends
After a very short time doing this, I began to see its effects
People started to tell me how much more enjoyable life was and how much better they felt with me in the same room
My happiness was not only doing wonders for me, but for everyone around me as well
We are all here to be happy
At that exact moment, I was reborn
I realised how simple it was for everything you are to become everything you were
We are extremely powerful, and control everything about ourselves
You have the ability to shed unwanted layers of skin, and become brand new, right now
Chapter 2- Bright Side of a Dark Moment
The power of positivity
Have you ever wondered why right now is called the present?
It's because it's the greatest gift anyone could receive
You're alive
You woke up this morning and that's a reason to celebrate
I credit all my happiness and successes to the power of the mind
Saying it's powerful is somewhat of an understatement
We were once prehistoric, un-evolved creatures who knew absolutely nothing
Then one day we discovered fire and everything changed
Then another day we invented the wheel and everything changed again
Before you knew it, we developed and entire civilisation and here we are
That's powerful, but what we're about to discuss goes far deeper than those layers of the mind
The brain is a muscle, and like a bicep the more you use it, the stronger it gets
It contains so much infinite ability and power we can't even understand how to acces its entirety
Everything that happens in your life was born first within your mind
You may not know it, but you're creating your own identity right this very second
Every thought that enters your head also leaves it
The universe is taking orders from your mind 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
You're solely responsible for everything great in your life
You're also responsible for everything you wish didn't happen as well
The universe is always listening, and it's time to take advantage of that
You don't have to be careful what you wish for, but you should be full of care
Do not be weary or neglect your thoughts
Think all the time, just make sure you want what you're thinking about
What first turned me on to this way of thinking and living is the law of attraction
This law simply states your mentality is your reality
No matter who you are, your mind has a direct connection to the universe, and as individuals we personally choose how to embrace that
Now, the next thing I share with you will prove to be a turning point in the creation of the rest of your life: The universe is completely unbiased
Let's say someone is speeding down the highway in a car and suddenly sees red and blue lights flashing in the rear view mirror
They pull off to the side of the road and get issued a speeding ticket. "
I hate speeding tickets!", the driver reacts. "
I never want another speeding ticket again." It appears that the driver just expressed a dislike for speeding tickets, but it's actually quite the contrary
The only thing the universe heard is the driver say "speeding ticket" two times
The universe is unbiased and doesn't pay attention to words like "want" or "don't want"
All it hears is the focus of your words and thoughts
The universe believes we want everything we think about, so think about what you want
I receive messages daily from people telling me that they were the law of attraction for a couple weeks and it was working really well, but then suddenly the bad days took over again
I tell everyone the exact same thing; the challenge is the best part
Every challenge is the universe's way of letting you know you're on the right track
The universe is a teacher, and as we learned in school, to reach the next level you must pass the test
You must prove that when faced with rain, you can still shine bright
Once you pass the test, you move on to the next level of your relationship with the universe
Eventually, after successfully enduring these challenges, the universe begins to hand you nothing but good fortune
Have you ever heard the saying "its always darkest before dawn"?
This is true, though there's more to it than that
You will be challenged, but once your sun comes up, it doesn't ever have to go back down
Those bad days are actually prepelling you towards a series of never ending good ones
That is, if you deal with them correctly
Prove to the universe you can stand up to any unfortunate event
Be thankful when the unexpected happens, because now you have the chance to exercise the ability to shine
Even a situation as devastating as someone's death has a light of positivity
Of course we miss them dearly, but they were here, and we were fortunate enough to share moments with them
Our memories made, and memories left will live on forever
Not only is the universe always listening, it's watching too
Simple good deeds like picking up trash or helping an elderly woman cross the street don't go unnoticed
Personally, I accept all organised relations as possibilities, but choose not to conform to any
I do however exercise a form of karma daily
I like to call it "the circle"
Every action we make is a single dot that will eventually connect itself and form a circle
Each good decision will be reintroduced to another good decision somewhere down the line
That also means each bad decision will reappear as well
There are so many opportunities to earn an extra credit in this world
Most of these opportunities will involve the way you interact with other people
Each one of us shares this planet with nearly 7 billion other human beings
Although I'd live for everyone to think the same way I do about positivity, I just can't expect for it to be that way all the time
The world is built off of interactions with others, and quite honestly, if everyone were the same there would be no need for any of us
It's very important to realise that if the opposite of what you believe in didn't exist, you'd have nothing to believe in
Without bad, we wouldn't know what to call good
Without lies, we wouldn't know what truth is
Always be accepting
We need the opposite, and it needs us
Thinking positive will always lead to a better outcome
A great example is by simply looking up
Literally
Walk outside, and look up
The sky is endless and filled with possibility
Now look down
No matter where you are, you will see an ending below
You decide whether or not to look up or down at every situation that occurs
Let unexpected incidents roll off you like rain drops dancing down your bedroom window
Now, if a negative thought pops into your head head that doesn't mean you're doing something wrong
Negative thoughts may happen, but it's all about how you deal with them
