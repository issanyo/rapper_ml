[Chorus]
I thought it would be easy
But I can't stop thinking about you, yeah
I can't believe those words came out my mouth
I know that I'm wrong now
I said I know that I'm wrong now
I can't believe that's how it turned out
Stop, back it up and turn around and think like
And now the only thing missing in my life is
The only thing missing in my life is
The only thing missing in my life is
My ride or die baby, oh

[Chorus]
Where do we go from here, go from here
The only thing missing in my life is
My ride or die baby, oh
Maybe this could be the end
Where do we go from here, go from here
Ride or die baby, oh
The only thing missing in my
Ride or die baby, oh
Maybe we could start again

[Verse 1]
The pressure to stay together the only thing consistent
And I know that you'd hate me for saying that
But least I admit it
I became a different person, I like that you did it
Almost slipped up on the road
But stayed true to our commitments, yeah
How can the one I was closes to become so distant?
How can all of the good times now be reminiscent?
How can your biggest fans turn into your biggest critic?
How come I take somebody's love
But scared to death to give it?
How many mistakes will I make until I just start to get it
I'm so sick of saying I'm sorry and being fake forgiven
You keep threatening to me that you're leaving
Well, this time, I'll listen
If you wanna go, I won't stop you from making that decision

[Chorus]
Where do we go from here, go from here
The only thing missing in my life is
My ride or die baby, oh
Maybe this could be the end
Where do we go from here, go from here
R-r-r-ride or die baby, oh
The only thing missing in my
Ride or die baby, oh
Maybe we could start again

[Verse 2]
Remember when you told me that I was better off lonely
Then I told you that all your last dudes were fake and phony
And then you old me that I put you down
But I put you above my homies
And we all know that when you take a break
That just means break up slowly
Last night, I had a nightmare 'bout my dream girl
That's fucked up
Somebody tell me what that mean for real
And while you're at it, grab the wheel
'Cause lately, I've been drinking 'til I can't feel
Tryna keep my mind off how I really feel
Like I kept it so honest in our relationship
Never tried to hide your from the world on some rapper shit
Never went behind your back and never hit up other chicks
If you think you can find someone else better, I'm cool with it

[Chorus]
Where do we go from here, go from here
The only thing missing in my life is
My ride or die baby, oh
Maybe this could be the end
Where do we go from here, go from here
R-r-r-ride or die baby, oh
The only thing missing in my
Ride or die baby, oh
Maybe we could start again

[Bridge]
I thought it would be easy
But I can't stop thinking about you, yeah
I can't believe those words came out my mouth
I know that I'm wrong now
I said I know that I'm wrong now
I can't believe that's how it turned out
Stop, back it up and turn around and think like

[Spoken]
I was, like, in this, like, crazy mode, bro
This is right before I, like, really moved to California
I was in this crazy [?] mode where I wanted to be, like, a legend so bad that I was thinking of, like, you know, all these things your life allows you to create, which is like this crazy movie, and I always have this, like, vision of making my life this crazy fucking movie
Movie, movie, movie

[Outro]
Maybe this could be the end
Or maybe we could start again
Maybe this could be the end
Or maybe we could start again
Maybe this could be the end
Or maybe we could start again
Maybe this could be the end
Or maybe we could start again
Maybe this could be the end
Or maybe we could start again
Maybe this could be the end
Or maybe we could start again
