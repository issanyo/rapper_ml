[Verse 1: E-40]
I'm seasoned off the green like a caper
Woke, [] like induced labor
Faded like a taper, high on dro, African hyena, Caviar Gold
My eyes are slow, I'm off of that liquor
You can tell I'm a thug, look at my cracked screen nigga
On my get dro, my Samsung, my iPhone, my Trackphone
They say he the man, but I can't stand
Men with long fingernails when they shake my hand
They stick their nails in your palm and squeeze hella hard
Like it's sharp, fingernails longer than my broad
I had a broad named Ramona, lived in Clearlake but moved to Capitola
I never fucked her, I promise, that's on my dead homie
'Bout her money, she love me, do anything for me

[Chorus]
The DJ freeze and bring it back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Bring it back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Bring it back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Bring it back, back, back, back, back, the DJ freeze and bring it back

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
It's that East Coast capo, Maine to El Paso
Been around the world, like latitude across a map bro
Is that so? Bitch you don't wanna see me in rap mode
I'm Ivan Drago, murder mics in front of packed shows
And smashed flows, yo my life is like a movie
Or a Woodstock documentary, the way I keeps it groovy
Rude, lewd, and amusin', more raw than a plate of sushi
In the kitchen when I'm cooking up, they call me Ratatouille
Yours truly, I've been on tours smokin' the best
And hit every dispensary in the Pacific Northwest
I've been stoned ever since, got some brain cells missin'
But I never let that shit interfere with ambition
It's Christian, back on my Michelin, I'm spittin', with lyrics written
Wrapped up, like a mummified ancient Egyptian
I'm hieroglyphically scriptin' my knowledge, passion, and wisdom
Yellin' fuck the system 'till they go and lock me up in prison
I am a doper and I'm only partially tryin'
I'm masterful debater, winnin' any argument I'm in
You could open up my chest and see the heart of a lion
Or open up my head and see why I'm in Arkham Asylum
A supervillain handlin' business to pay tuition
In the school of hard knocks, talk little but always listen
With a button down on like a young Peter Griffin, let me get 'em

[Chorus]
The DJ freeze and bring it back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Bring it back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Bring it back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Bring it back, back, back, back, back, the DJ freeze and bring it back

[Verse 3: MOD SUN]
First I take it to the top and then I bring it back
Hit the road and make alot and then I bring it back
Brought it right back to my block, yeah I bring it back
When the DJ hit stop (yeah what you do?)
Aye, bring it back, no question that
I'm on my do or die shit, up all night shit
Start a riot, you should try it, do you ever feel like flyin'?
You say that you at the top but I'm still climbin'
Started a line and then I get better with time and
The only thing on my mind is this pressure gon' make a diamond
And I'll be damned if I ever let 'em steal my shot
You cannot kill my vibe, you cannot break my stride
You cannot live this life unless you walk that line
My line like what you find, they say forever we kind
I say it every time, inside of every rhyme
That if you wanna go and get it its a hell of a
Ride low in the city with the top down
Lord knows I'll be headed to the top now
Ride low in my city with the top down
Lord knows I'll be headed to the top now, smokin' loud
MOD SUN get hot now, my flow does not stop now
Got bars man for lockdown, they all want to talk now
Yeah my phone ring alot now, just let there be rock now

[Chorus]
The DJ freeze and bring it back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Bring it back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Bring it back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Bring it back, back, back, back, back, the DJ freeze and bring it back
