Waddup? Yeah
I'll be honest, this the second take
That's cocky

Green bud up if it's your first time
I'm Hippy Hop, positive like a plus sign
I love what I got, I'm so self my
I tell em be positive like the bloodline
High up, like a Swisher in the hills
I'm a fan of myself, when I rap I get chills, for real
Out of 10 I'm a 1, plus 9
Givin' Goosebumps like R.L Stine

And you could catch us on the beach
Crack a brew, puff bud, then we grab a bite to eat, uh
And smile extra big for the girls that didn't see me
Said I was a square, well what shape is your TV?

Yeah, this is what you get when
You've got dreams and will do anything to get them
I'm living good, I just thought you should know
And welome to my element, where everyday we celebrate just for the hell of it
I'm living good, I just thought you should

And I hit the ground runnin
But for no one in particular, I'm open to the public
Wanna hit, so I see my peers in the rear view
And they just stay close to home like the infield

But I was born out in left field
You ask me to guess the [?] kind of attitude
No braces and they still say the smile great
Plus I got a contact for a sack in every state

Shouts to [?] Steve up in San Fran
I've never had weed that purple up in my hand man
We on vacation all the time
Enough fun for a lifetime in summer '09 like
Vegas: we done that
Cali: We done that
Even hit NY for diesel then we come back
I swear we did some other shit I can't remember
But whatever, we got Cannabis Cup in November

Yeah, this is what you get when
You've got dreams and will do anything to get them
I'm living good, I just thought you should know
And welome to my element, where everyday we celebrate just for the hell of it
I'm living good, I just thought you should

Save me a piece, I'm comin', yeah
Save me a seat, I'm comin'
And they are so up thumbing
I'm trynna make something
I'm so up and coming
No pause, see we hit continue
Press start, next level, no issue
Damn, and I kinda just dissed you
But if you thinkin "is he  talking to me?" then it's you

And older women seem to love me
The younger ones just wanna fuck then hug me
They all wanna stick around
Gotta kick em out
When I'm in the zone, no doubt
Don't bug me

Is that really how you feel? Yes
Is music and weed really all you need? Yes
I got haze, look how fresh
Now watch me get ADD's attention

Yeah, this is what you get when
You've got dreams and will do anything to get them
I'm living good, I just thought you should know
And welome to my element, where everyday we celebrate just for the hell of it
I'm living good, I just thought you should

That's so sick dude
You gotta be freakin cuz that's that's
Let me do the hooks now
