Mod Sun:
Yeah
Did it again last night, turned into an animal
Don't judge me though, sometimes I just lose control
Once midnight hits, I just can't fight that feeling, no
Lookin' up at the ceiling and I just gotta gotta gotta go

Straight from the stars, swing from the stars
Want the best night of your life?
OK, just leave me in charge
No not every avenue, every single boulevard
So take take take take it easy
Cause we're 'bout to go hard

Chorus:
And while the city sleeps we're howlin' at the moon, the moon
It's me and all my friends and we're howlin' at the moon, the moon

Yeah
Did it again last night, turned into an animal
Did it, did it again last night, turned into an animal


And if you woke up, that's a reason to celebrate
If you broke up, yo that's a reason to celebrate
Aye you know what?
You got a reason to celebrate
We got no time to hesitate
Loving every minute we're giving out
We're livin' like

Hell yeah, hell yeah
One more time; hell yeah!
I feel good, like real good
We get along and I knew we would
This night is young and so are we
We're dancin' like nobody see
And if anybody tryna fuck with me
I put The Beatles on and let it be...

[Chrous]
And while the city sleeps we're howlin' at the moon, the moon
It's me and all my friends and we're howlin' at the moon, the moon

Did it again last night, turned into an animal
Don't judge me though, sometimes I just lose control
Once midnight hits I just can't fight that feeling, no!

And while the city sleeps we're howlin' at the moon, the moon
It's me and all my friends and we're howlin' at the moon, the moon

Did it again last night, turned into an animal
