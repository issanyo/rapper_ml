[Hook]
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking

[Verse 1: Mod Sun]
Burning the herb, it's a magical plant
When I get high, I just like how I act
The boys in the blue try to tell me I can't
Say that it's evil, it makes you go mad
Changes the people all good to all bad
I just wanna lay in a field, on my back
Stare out the clouds and just remember that
The secret of life is to laugh
It is a fact, THC makes you relax
I am no criminal, go check my past
Don't count the three times I got caught with the stash
Serve that community service with class
Hell I was stoned, I was having a blast
I'm not saying you should just don't tell me I can't
I'm grateful that I chose to give it a chance
Cause it helped me get off my ass

[Hook]
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking
This the best verse ever written, ha uhn yeah

[Verse 2: Mod Sun]
Burning the herb, it's a magical plant
When I get high, I just like how I act
Nothing to hide, got no tent on my class
Four way stop sign, I'm a chill and go last
Sativa, the way I play for my grass
Switches and papers, how I like it wrapped
Man I been there, did that
Three months, nine-hundred blunts
Between me, T-Mills, and G
I'm talking like seven days, seven-hundred J's
Overseas, it was me and Michael B
That was right around the time, my man Cisco
Said mother don't charge no fee
So I took it back to the suburbs
Every summer roll around with Tony E, yeah

[Hook]
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking
Until I die I'll never quit smoking
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking

[Bridge]
I'll be gettin' high 'til the day that I die (4x)
Until I die I will never quit (never quit)

[Hook]
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking
Until I die I'll never quit smoking
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking
I'll never quit (never quit!)
I'll never quit smoking
Pass it my way, pass it my way
