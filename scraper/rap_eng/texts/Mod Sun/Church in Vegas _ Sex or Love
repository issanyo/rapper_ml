[Verse 1: MOD SUN]
Oh!
And you did things you should never do to your best friend
And I know when enough is enough, I’ve learned my lesson
And it’s fine when it’s good, but when it’s bad it’s funny
And we only spend time 'cause now we’re spending money

[Pre-Chorus: MOD SUN]
I stay faithful, you’re a cheater
You’re a goner, and I’m a keeper
And I know that shit hurts, (fuck) but I’m not sorry
You live and you learn, that’s all that you taught me

[Chorus: blackbear]
And maybe one day I’ll stop having sex and start making love
And maybe one day I’ll stop having sex and start making love

[Verse 2: blackbear]
We both know that we did things you can only do when you're naked
And now you make me leave the room when you’re changing
And I know in a perfect world we would get married, hey (fuck)
I always thought that shit was scary

[Pre-Chorus: blackbear]
You stayed faithful, and I always cheated
I always can get it, but I never could keep it
But what I wanted wasn’t what I needed
And I know that shit hurts, well, I am sorry
And the day I do lie, I’ll say that you taught me

[Bridge: blackbear]
Yeah, you remind me of a church in Las Vegas
You’re covered head to toe in sin and lost wages
And you think that everyone, everyone is replaceable
But they’re not, no

[Chorus: blackbear]
And maybe one day I’ll stop having sex and start making love
And maybe one day I’ll stop having sex and start making love
