[Intro]
As I dance x7

[Verse 1: Mod Sun]
I'm not afraid to say that I think I'm a hero
I vow to make the world a better place before my child turns zero
They say the darkest moment always comes right before dawn
Well let me push the sun out of the earth
Don't give up, just hold on
(Walking in the same way...)

[Hook: Mod Sun]
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Yeah I only write what I feel
Might not say what you wanna hear but at least I'm real

[Verse 2: Mod Sun]
I wake up in the afternoon because I'm every morning
I'm going on Hunter Thomspson in the pages of my story
Many times I felt like Arthur Rimbaud in the 18th century
Endlessly writing my poetry waiting for someone to listen to me
Then I found you we found each other I call you my sister I call you my brother
I call you my hippy I call you my friend and I swear it'll stay just like this til the end
Til the lights go out, no more seconds left
I say it out loud with my last breath
I walk the same way

[Hook: Mod Sun]
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Yeah I only write what I feel
Might not say what you wanna hear but at least I'm real

[Hook: Mod Sun]
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Yeah I only write what I feel
Might not say what you wanna hear but at least I'm real

[Outro]
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
Walking in the same way as I did
