[Intro]
Oh, tell me all your secrets, yeah
Tell me all your, tell me all your
Oh, tell me all your secrets, girl
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I wanna know about your past
Wanna know about your last
Wanna know, know I asked you
I wanna know what makes you laugh
Wanna know what makes you sad
Wanna know why you got your tattoos
You can tell me 'bout your ex
You can tell me bout the sex
You can tell me ’bout regrets that you tried to forget and
Even if it's fucked up
Shit, I still wanna know about it

[Chorus]
Oh, tell me all your secrets, yeah
Tell me all your, tell me all your
Oh, tell me all your secrets, girl
I need it, I need it
And I'll tell you mine, you tell me yours
My lips are sealed so you can tell me more, yeah
Oh, tell me all your secrets, yeah
Tell me all your, tell me all your
(Tell me all your secrets, tell me all your secrets)

[Verse 2]
I wanna know what makes you cum
Wanna know what makes you numb
Wanna know what makes you run away
I wanna know what turns you on
Make you turn off the alarm
Then turn over and make love all day
So don’t hesitate to tell me the truth
The last thing that I'd ever do is judge you
So, even if it's fucked up
Shit, I still wanna know about it

[Chorus]
Oh, tell me all your secrets, yeah
Tell me all your, tell me all your
Oh, tell me all your secrets, girl
I need it, I need it
And I'll tell you mine, you tell me yours
My lips are sealed so you can tell me more, yeah
Oh, tell me all your secrets, yeah
Tell me all your, tell me all your
(Tell me all your secrets, tell me all your secrets)

[Bridge]
She's got secrets like we all got secrets
You tell me your darkest, you tell me your deepest and
I can keep it
She's got secrets like we all got secrets
You tell me your darkest, you tell me your deepest and
Even if it's fucked up
Shit, I still wanna know about it

[Chorus]
Oh, tell me all your secrets, yeah
Tell me all your, tell me all your
Oh, tell me all your secrets, girl
I need it, I need it
And I'll tell you mine, you tell me yours
My lips are sealed so you can tell me more, yeah
Oh, tell me all your secrets, yeah
Tell me all your, tell me all your
(Tell me all your secrets, tell me all your secrets)
