[Intro]
I’m ready to go

[Verse 1: MOD SUN]
We do this shit every night
Run it up run it up I want more
Better have a big bottle in that ice
When I walk when I walk through the door

They be thinking god damn I be too nice
I be thinking god damn I be too nice
Some nights god damn had to say it twice
God damn god damn this the fuckin life

We do this shit every night
Grab an ounce we can blow that whole zip
Yeah we can get as high as we like
Tell the bouncer stop acting like a bitch

I do what want when I’m with my hippies x3
I do what want when I’m...

We do this shit every night
All we ever see is flashing lights
And they don’t fuck with us
Sike
We get whatever we like

Show up drunk to the flight
Almost got in a fight
Ya I hear what you say
But we do what we like

[Hook]
We do this shit every night
(we do this shit every night)
We can get whatever you like
(we can get whatever you like)
We do this shit every night
(we do this shit every night)
We can get whatever you like
(we can get whatever you like)

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
We gonna party till the sun down
Security got us fucked up
Didn’t even bring the guns out
We just came have fun y’all

Everybody put your hands up
Everybody put your hands up
Everybody put your cups up
And take a shot now

Living my life like I want to
Looking at you like I want you
Good vibes, good vibes
I think I hit the bong too

I’m dizzy
I think I, I think I
Forgot my memory
Lord please forgive me

Somebody help me get back to my car
Last night was amazing but it went too far
How many shots did I have
Oh my god

What the fuck man
Mod Sun got me all drunk man
They say you only live like once man
So pour it up
Here’s a toast to us
To keep ballin like jumpman

[Hook]
We do this shit every night
(we do this shit every night)
We can get whatever you like
(we can get whatever you like)
We do this shit every night
(we do this shit every night)
We can get whatever you like
(we can get whatever you like)
(Talkin’ my, talkin’ my shit)

We do this shit every night
We can get whatever you like
We do this shit every night
We can get whatever you like
(Talkin’ my, talkin’ my shit)

[Verse 3: MOD SUN]
We do this shit every night
Ya watch what I do when I get in my zone
Ya watch what how I do it, I do what I want when I want
And I jump in the uber to take me back home

Jump out the uber to hit a new spot
Once I get started you know I can’t stop
Run to the bar and I grab me a bott
Pop pop pop, you know how the story goes

One time for the place that I came from
Two times for the place that I’m at though
Three times for my people who amazing
No time for the people who be assholes

(I thought I told you)
I do what I want when I’m with my hippies
I smoke a whole lot when I’m with my hippies
I do what I want and then I dip it quickly

Now we getting trippy in the whip
Grab the whisky, take a sippy
Sometimes I’m hella picky
Like when I’m pullin sticky out the zippy

Show up drunk to the flight
Almost got in a fight
Ya I hear what you say
But we do what we like

[Hook]
We do this shit every night
(we do this shit every night)
We can get whatever you like
(we can get whatever you like)
We do this shit every night
(we do this shit every night)
We can get whatever you like
(we can get whatever you like)
(Talkin my, talkin my shit)

We do this shit every night (talkin’ my shit)
We can get whatever you like (talkin’ my shit)
We do this shit every night (talkin’ my shit)
We can get whatever you like (talkin’ my shit)

We do this shit every night
