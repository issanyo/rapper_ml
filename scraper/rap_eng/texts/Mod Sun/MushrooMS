These are the days, of wonder and miracle
Half stoned half drunk, I really can't feel it though
Started confused and ended up spiritual

Now everything's different, my world has gone upside down
All of this distance, don't know what I'm talking about
My friend's think I lost it

And so between me and you, I'm telling the truth
I think the government is lying, to me and the youth
And that's a damn shame (damn shame)

Cause I'm on mushrooms
Mushrooms
I guess I do feel it
All the mushrooms

And now I'm floating in the ocean, with no sign of land
Lost out at sea, finding out who I am
(I am myself) x6

And so between me and you, I'm telling the truth
I think the government is lying, to me and the youth
And that's a damn shame (damn shame)

Cause I'm on mushrooms
Mushrooms
I guess I do feel it
All the mushrooms

It might explain all the madness
