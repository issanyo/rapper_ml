[Verse 1: Blackbear]
I be smashin' through the city, yeah
90 on the dash yeeaaahh
All my new friends fuckin' with me now
Wonder how long that's gon' last yeah

I go shoppin' dolo just to waste time
They say save my money, but I spend mine
They act like I'm getting fucked up every night
And when I say I don't they think that it's a lie

[Hook]
I've been spendin' too much time at L.A.X
I've been spendin' too much time thinkin' 'bout sex
I've been spendin' too much time with fake ass friends
Tell me would you love me if I ain't make millions?

[Verse 1: MOD SUN]
(So I've been) smashin' through the city
I got 90 on the dash yeah
All my new friends fuckin' with me
I wonder how long that's gon' last (Mary Jane ain't bad)

[Chorus]
Yo, I need some new friends
Uh, tell me where they at
I need some new friends
Uh, someone who got my back
I need some new friends (Mary Jane ain't bad)
Yo I need some new friends (Mary Jane ain't bad)

Yo I need some new friends
Yeah, someone to smoke a bag
I need some new friends
Yeah, someone to split the tab
I need some new friends (Mary Jane ain't bad)
Yo I need some new friends (Mary Jane ain't bad)

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of smokin' all this weed alone
Another zone, I smoke straight to my dome
When I'm in the studio I don't answer my phone
(At the tone, please record your message)

Yeah, people ask me everyday
For a little advise
The only thing that I say:
(Is) "Go live yo life."

I won't change the way I am
'til the day I die
All my best friends are old friends now
And I don't know why

[Hook: Blackbear]
I've been spendin' too much time at L.A.X
I've been spendin' too much time thinkin' 'bout sex
I've been spendin' too much time with fake ass friends
Tell me would you love me if I ain't make millions?

I've been spendin' too much time at L.A.X
I've been spendin' too much time thinkin' 'bout sex
I've been spendin' too much time with fake ass friends
Tell me would you love me if I ain't make millions?

[outro]
I be smashin' through the city, yeah
90 on the dash yeeaaahh
All my, new friends fuckin' with me now
Wonder how long that's gon' last yeah
