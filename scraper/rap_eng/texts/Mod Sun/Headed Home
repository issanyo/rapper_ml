You’ve been on my mind
You’ve been on my mind
You’ve been on my mind the whole time
Well, let the show begin
Six years later, now the world ‘bouta be knowin’ him
And the number one question is: Does he know himself?
Hell yes I do, I’ll overcome any amount of doubt
Because I’ve been soul searchin’
Look inside the mirror, and I see a good person
Livin’ out my words, yeah I’ve been researchin’
Think deep but don’t sink, I’ve been below the surface

I’m never looking back, a rolling stone
Born a long way from here, I’m headed home
Dance beneath the diamond sky, don’t wanna die
I just wanna live my life while I’m alive

And this is what the inside of my mind sounds like
Holding on to good times, but plottin’ out my next ones
Over and over, say “everything is alright”
Got myself back to the center, feelin’ more me than ever
You’d think that I’d be thinkin’ more about the long run
You’d think that I’d be thinkin’ more about the long run
But lately I’ve been goin’ crazy over one song
‘Cause every word that’s on this album means the world to me
Literally this shit ain’t just a verse to me
A lonely childhood, I learned to leave the one that I was alone with
And when it came down to it, I found peace inside
I put it all together, alive before I die
See, once upon a time in the middle of the night I was followin’ my headlights
And all I could see was 10 feet in front of me
But I just believed, believed that there was a path…
HERE I AM…

Dwelling on the past; I just simply see no need
Look inside my wants, and you will simply see no greed
Give more than I take, you know I take that shit to my grave
Movin’ on my dreams, you know I put that shit on my name
Lost inside the sound and you know all my dues have been paid
Learned my best advice from my worst mistake
See it clearly even when the vision blurry
Imma know my songs well, and Imma make sure that you hear me
LOOK UP
