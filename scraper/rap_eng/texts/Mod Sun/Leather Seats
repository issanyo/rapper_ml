[Verse 1: Young Focus]
Riding deep
Yesterday I spoke to the devil
He said that the limelight cheap
But like two lesbians on their hands and knees with a double dildo
I'm just trying to make these ends meet
See we never sin but again religion
Is what you make it if money what you seek
Got some good girls in the pool
Popping pills under water, no Adele
But they rolling in the deep
Bro if you just for that dough
Then know you ain't nothing like him and I
You got diamonds in yo pupils you must be a Gemini
Stop, take a step back
Think about it see this rap shit is for the new kids
Like two fingers on a touch screen slid in opposite directions
Nigga we just trying to make it big

[Hook]
This game is ours
The dream is ours
The world is ours
All of ours (x2)
Bitch follow the leader like a motherfucking cult (x3)
We're vibrating
But you probably can't feel us through them leather seats

[Verse 2: Arcane]
Uh, The world is mine
Ask Russell bout my global grind
Raps my job im going over time
I'm going over time
You always see us on tour like brochures
So ima kick this shit til my toe hurt
Me and my niggas on a roll like boulders
Go against me or you can concur
Ever wonder what I'm doing don't ask ya self
I'm working on me to surpass myself
Nobody can be me, in a documentary
When i die they go still try to cast to myself
Ugh, they ain't fucking with us Asher
Niggas SSA , ass backwards
So turn the bass up, let your face scrunch
And live like tomorrow doesn't matter

[Hook]

[Bridge: Haz Solo]
Aw shit, it's gifts falling down and its holes in my crown
My momma told me boy piss with that seat up and dream with your feet up
Cuz ain't nothing you can't do
Your lackluster is their blockbuster & on your worst day
Your more alive than them on their birthday
This whole world is yours for the taking

[Verse 3: Mod Sun]
