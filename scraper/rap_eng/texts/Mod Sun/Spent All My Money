[Verse 1: blackbear]
I be smashin' through the city, ayy
90 on the dash hand
All my new friends fuckin' with me now
Wonder how long that's gon' last, yeah
I go shoppin' dolo just to waste time
They say save my money, but I spend mine
They act like I'm gettin' fucked up every night
And when I say I don't, they think that it's a lie

[Chorus: blackbear]
I've been spendin' too much time at LAX
I've been spendin' too much time thinkin' 'bout sex
I've been spendin' too much time with fake ass friends
Tell me, would you love me if I ain't make millions?

[Verse 2: Mod Sun]
So I be smashin' through the city
I got 90 on the dash, yeah
All my new friends fuckin' with me
I wonder how long that's gon' last
Yo I need some new friends
Tell me where they at
I need some new friends
Someone who got my back
I need some new friends
Yo I need some new friends
Yo I need some new friends
Yeah, someone that smoke a pack
I need some new friends
Yeah, someone that split the tab
I need some new friends
I need some new friends
I'm tired of smokin' all this weed alone
Another zone I smoked straight to my dome
When I'm in the studio I don't answer my phone
At the tone, please record your message
Yeah people ask me every day for a little advice
The only thing that I say is, "Go live your life"
I won't change the way I am 'til the day I die
All my best friends are old friends now, and I don't know why

[Chorus: blackbear]
I've been spendin' too much time at LAX
I've been spendin' too much time thinkin' 'bout sex
I've been spendin' too much time with fake ass friends
Tell me, would you love me if I ain't make millions?
I've been spendin' too much time at LAX
I've been spendin' too much time thinkin' 'bout sex
I've been spendin' too much time with fake ass friends
Tell me, would you love me if I ain't make millions?

[Outro: blackbear]
I be smashin' through the city, ayy
90 on the dash hand
All my new friends fuckin' with me now
Wonder how long that's gon' last, yeah
