Try your best, be happy as fuck
(Did it again last night)

Try your best, be happy as fuck
Its hard to reach sometimes
Ya know cause shit be bad
MOD SUN couldn't have said it no better
Ya know what I'm sayin' like happy as fuck
Try your best to celebrate life if you can
And if you can't try your best to get to that point
Place where I'm tryna get, happy as fuck
I ain't all the way there yet but I'm gettin' there
Thank you, MOD SUN
