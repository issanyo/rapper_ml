[Verse 1: MOD SUN]
I live like happiness is currency therefore I'm rich
Got a bank account of good times & smiles in abundance
I’m obviously a pisces the way I got flow
And must’ve been a tennis shoe in a previous life the way I got soul
Only tears that happen come from tears from laughin'
I be leavin' people gaspin' tellin' jokes while puffin' passin'
True to how we livin' straight swimmin' in a pit of passion
No sleepy head, never in bed, never gon catch me crashin', no
Fly high in my tye dye, I’m that guy
Got the sunrise on my eyes, and I'm running for a Nobel Peace Prize
Legalize, decriminalize, improvise,  and compromise
Give a high five if they evil eye, meet any hate with no reply
I get high & can’t find a single thing thats not fun
Still no deal, but my career lookin' like I got one
Top the charts, in magazines, but its just the start I’m not done
So I'mma treat this night like “fuck it, I’m on one.”

[Chorus: B Rolla and MOD SUN]
You can have anything that you want
They didn’t want it at first, but still we gave it to em
You can have anything that you need
And now everybody fuckin with what we doin
All ya really gotta do is believe
No “I & me” its “us & we”, & we gon impact this world
Mentality 2 Reality
I'ma focus on my dreams not the salary

[Verse 2: MOD SUN]
Yesterday’s thoughts paint tomorrow’s picture
Don’t stop that dreamin' cuz, don’t stop believin' sister
Embrace the challenges, guarantee you pass the test
Give birth to a happy thought, that shit gon' manifest
I'm livin proof that “The Secret” works
Teach Law Of Attraction & all its perks
Encountering then empowering
Until their confidence is towering
Pull ya the center like gravity
Killin' all silence with fantasy
Change ya perspective than casually
Da Vinci me up a masterpiece
I wish you all Health, Wealth, Success, & Happiness
You’re energy is stunning & ya spirits lookin fabulous
Simply Immaculate, if I do say so
I mean the world is literally yours
And shit I’m so grateful
I just can’t lay low, just can’t move slow
Eyes rarely close, head barely touch a pillow
Ain't no boundaries on what you can do
So if you ever need some reassurance just remember I believe in you

[Chorus: B Rolla and MOD SUN]
You can have anything that you want
They didn’t want it at first, but still we gave it to em
You can have anything that you need
And now everybody fuckin with what we doin
All ya really gotta do is believe
No “I & me” its “us & we”, & we gon impact this world
Mentality 2 Reality
I'ma focus on my dreams not the salary

[Outro: MOD SUN Interview]
When you are not rhyming, writing, in the studio doing hip hop
When you're not doing that, when you're not doing music
What do you do?
I have a studio, so...
Skateboarding, videogames...
No, no I live in my studio at home
Being a solo artist, it's you wake up, and you are like on the clock
So I wake up, I got to be on my twitter
I got to be on my facebook
I got to be on my blog
I got to touch and connect with people
It's all this, and it's like, with this, it's more than music
Because there's no music without the idea
I don't think negative about anything, anymore
There's no ying yang, there's no for every good there's a little bad
It's all good, I use this system
In my mind I see a dresser, there's a top drawer, middle drawer, bottom drawer
Every time a negative thought comes in I put it in the bottom drawer
Open up the top, that's where I keep everything that keeps me happy
You know what I'm saying? I open up the top drawer
And in my head it goes (noise) all my happy thoughts, know what I'm saying?
And the negative thought's gone
Well you got to have some bad things
I don't, I really don't
