[Verse 1: Karizma]
I wanna say I’m sorry
I didn’t mean to hurt you
You believe me yet?
I told you forever
L is the letter
But I am a loser
And you said you’re lesser
We should be together
We can watch Netflix or
I can text you "I love you"
Sitting next to you
Yeah I’m the best for you
I’m a liar, a cheater
Prior to meeting you
I got around, got around
Jotting down hearts in my Econ notes
Fuck school, man
I don’t need degrees, I hope
Keep on coasting
Flirt just to flirt some
Yeah, I’m a person
A person who’s hurt some, yeah
Write a verse so I search for the worst
To admit I’m a bad guy but I’m worth it
Hello, it’s Mr. Gone In The Morning, yeah
I'll write a song 'bout you though
Baby girl, I don't got much for you
I just wanna let you know, come on
Let’s forget the past
It is past, it is last
Like, *so last night*
Just admit it, laugh

[Chorus: Karizma]
Trying to tell me that you’re lonely
I believe you, I believe you
Believe you baby
Tell me you don’t know me
Listen to your speakers
Listen to your speakers play
It’s just me, you and the moon tonight
It’s just me, you and the moon tonight
It’s just me, you and the moon tonight
It's just me, you and the moon, yeah


[Verse 2: Mod Sun]
Me, me, me, me
Me, you and the moon
Every conversation we had ended too soon
Got me feeling like Miles Davis
I’m kinda blue
So don’t be mad at me
If I force a rendezvous
I’ll give you everything, everything that you deserve
So tell them other other guys to go ahead and wait their turn
Swerve, send them to the curb
It’s me and you against the world
Baby let it burn, yeah
See, me, I’m about them better days
I’m about to change your life
You will be amazed, yeah
For real, I’m about them better days
I didn’t do so good in school
Nowadays I’m getting straight A’s
In the game of life
You gotta be rolling dice
You gotta be taking risks
You got me staying up nights
Me and Karizma on the move
Look up, I’ll see you soon
It’s me, you and the moon
Mod Sun

[Chorus: Karizma]
Trying to tell me that you’re lonely
I believe you, I believe you
Believe you baby
Tell me you don’t know me
Listen to your speakers
Listen to your speakers play
It’s just me, you and the moon tonight
It’s just me, you and the moon tonight
It’s just me, you and the moon tonight
It's just me, you and the moon, yeah

[Outro: Karizma]
Yeah
Just me, you and the moon [x2]
Me, you and the moon [x2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
