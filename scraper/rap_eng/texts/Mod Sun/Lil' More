I always wanted a little more, a little more
Then I got it, a little more
Didn't want it anymore
I wanted a little more, a little more than friends
Then i got it, didn't want it no didn't want it anymore

But I got everybody telling me you've been round with everybody, in my scene
Everybody's telling me that you've been fucking everybody, you're not right for me

I saw you at your worst, you saw me at my best
Put diamonds on your neck, you put holes in my chest

I always wanted a little more, a little more
Then I got it, a little more
Didn't want it anymore
I wanted a little more, a little more than friends
Then i got it, didn't want it no didn't want it anymore

Do I really have to forget you?
Because I don't want to

We lasted 3 whole months that's more than everyone expected
We went different ways with different directions

I saw you at your worst, you saw me at my best
Put diamonds on your neck, you put holes in my chest

And I know everybody's telling me that you've been round with everybody in my scene (you're not for me)
Everybody's telling me that you've been fucking everybody, you're not right for me. (not for me)

I always wanted a little more, a little more
Then I got it, a little more. Didn't want it anymore
I wanted a little more, a little more than friends
Then i got it, didn't want it no

Do I really have to forget you?
Do I really have to forget you?
Do I really have to forget you?
Do I really have to forget you?
Because I don't want to

You're not right for me

I always wanted a little more, a little more
Then I got it, a little more. Didn't want it anymore
I wanted a little more, a little more than friends
Then i got it, didn't want it no

Do I really have to forget you?
Because I don't want to
