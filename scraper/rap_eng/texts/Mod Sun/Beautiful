[Verse 1: Abstract]
There was a time that I worked for the man
He put a coin in my hand
Told me I'd slave 'til the end of my days
Said it was best if I followed his plan
Set an alarm, woke me at dawn
Said he the king and I'm just a pawn
That's your boss' boss' boss' boss
Sittin' on a throne of lies, legs crossed
That's the hand talkin', that's the great lie
No ballistics vest on a nine to five
That's suicide, I will not comply
I'm my own boss till the day I die
You don't own me, I became free
Off of livin' off of what I once dreamed
I'm the livin' proof, I'm the newest youth
I'm a nuisance to 'em, how I spread the truth
'Bout to storm the castle with A Team Worldwide
Save the kingdom from itself one time
We might only get to live one life
Swear that you ain't gotta pay his price

[Bridge: Abstract]
I don't know why I would go outside
Rather jump into a book and live inside my mind
Get lost in my studio until I catch a vibe
Don't know what day of the week it is, I'm losing track of time

[Chorus: Abstract & MOD SUN]
It's beautiful, yes it is
It's beautiful, the way I live
It's beautiful, don't you agree?
It's beautiful, I'm finally free
It's beautiful, yes it is
It's beautiful, the way I live
It's beautiful, don't you agree?
It's beautiful (oh yeah), I'm finally free
It's beautiful (it's beautiful), it's beautiful (it's beautiful), it's beautiful (oh yeah), it's beautiful (yeah yeah, what's up?)
It's beautiful (beautiful), don't you agree? (don't you?)
It's beautiful (oh yeah), but that's just me (yeah)

[Verse 2: MOD SUN]
There was a time that I worked for the man (real shit)
I do what I had to, I knew that I can do so much more (oh yeah)
I had big dreams that they don't understand (what's up?)
So I dropped out quick, came up with a plan
All across the land, goin' hand to hand
Started in a van, now I'm in a bus
Still can't comprehend, off in Neverland
Feel like Peter Pan, I'm never growin' up
And these are the words that I say, every single day when I wake up (wake up)
I'ma do it my own way 'til the day I die, I give no fucks (no fucks)
So I'm gonna spend my day gettin' lost inside my room
So high I might fly away in the middle of the afternoon
Just let me go, yeah (alright), I'm outta control, yeah (oh yeah)
I'm all alone, yeah (oh yeah), but you should know

[Chorus: Abstract & MOD SUN]
It's beautiful, yes it is
It's beautiful, the way I live
It's beautiful, don't you agree?
It's beautiful, I'm finally free
It's beautiful, yes it is
It's beautiful, the way I live
It's beautiful, don't you agree?
It's beautiful (oh yeah), I'm finally free
It's beautiful (it's beautiful), it's beautiful (it's beautiful), it's beautiful (oh yeah), it's beautiful (yeah yeah, what's up?)
It's beautiful (beautiful), don't you agree? (don't you?)
It's beautiful (oh yeah), but that's just me (yeah)
It's beautiful (it's beautiful), it's beautiful (it's beautiful), it's beautiful (oh yeah), it's beautiful (yeah yeah, what's up?)
It's beautiful (beautiful), don't you agree? (don't you?)
It's beautiful (oh yeah), but that's just me (yeah)
