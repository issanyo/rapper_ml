[Chorus]
I got this money and I heard they found out
People makin' me nervous, makin' me nervous
They heard I got things, wanna run in my house
People makin' me nervous, makin' me nervous
I got this money and I heard they found out
People makin' me nervous, makin' me nervous
They heard I got things, wanna run in my house
People makin' me nervous, makin' me nervous

[Verse 1]
Okay I got this money
People makin' me nervous
I see these people snitch and shit
They do it on purpose
I got all of these bitches
Constantly lurkin'
Tryna get in my lane
So I'm constantly swervin'
Sleep with one eye open
Cause I know they creepin'
How I ball so outrageous
They just ball on the weekend
I got all this money
And I know they see it
Yeah I got all this money
Bitch I can't believe it

[Chorus]
I got this money and I heard they found out
People makin' me nervous, makin' me nervous
They heard I got things, wanna run in my house
People makin' me nervous, makin' me nervous

[Verse 2]
Got 20k in the shoebox locked up under my bed
Always changing my number
I know they listening
I see my friends, they like the feds
I seen the feds, they like my friends
The realest shit I ever said
I'm ballin' now
Can't stop, can't stop
But the money callin' now, swish
Oh yeah, oh yeah, the fact that I'm ballin' now
Can't stop, can't stop
But the money callin' now

[Chorus]
I got this money and I heard they found out
People makin' me nervous, makin' me nervous
They heard I got things, wanna run in my house
People makin' me nervous, makin' me nervous

[Outro]
I got this money and I heard they found out
People makin' me nervous, makin' me nervous
They heard I got things, wanna run in my house
People makin' me nervous, makin' me nervous
