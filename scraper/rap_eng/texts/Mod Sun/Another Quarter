[Verse 1: Mickey Avalon]
Can I get some dope acapella straight through the ghetto
Come to my crib, make a deal with the devil
Like heavy metal, with the stiletto
Carving up kids like my name was Gepetto
Hello, Dolly the life of the party
I don't play games 'cause my name ain't Atari
Sorry Charlie, I crashed your Ferrari
Black-belt crazy, don't know karate
Bodyslam your son, I'm the King of the Ring and I swing like a jazz band
The main man at the hotdog stand
I'm light on my feet and I've got heavy hands
Head southbound for a bag of the brown
If they asked who sent you say Pogo the Clown
Simmer down when I come around town
All the Pavlov dogs got locked in the pound

Put another quarter in the jukebox
Put another quarter in the jukebox
Put another quarter in the jukebox
Put another quarter in the jukebox

[Verse 2: MOD SUN]
Okay, I did Cali like I'm 2Pac
I said fuck two cops
I just fucked my girl like I've got two cocks
I walked two blocks wearing nothing but a tube sock
Hit up Mickey A like, "who got the oo-wop?"
Scoop me up in a droptop
Now I'm rolling on like it's Woodstock
Acid in my juice box
High-C, high as me, Sunny LSD
It's gonna be a couple pounds if you smoking with me
Like, faded was the case that they gave me
Offered my own world, ain't nobody gonna save me
Smoking in the crib, I've been high since a baby
And I'm doing drugs that was made in the 80's
Give me a minute I bet that I could go and change your mind up
The way that I'm living I bet that I could do this 'til my times up
Rehab is for quitters so why the fuck would you stop?
Fuck a quarter I'mma put a pound in the jukebox

Put another quarter in the jukebox
Put another quarter in the jukebox
Put another quarter in the jukebox
Put another quarter in the jukebox

Hey, they called me juice box man you know I hit that High-C

[Verse 3: Mickey Avalon]
Can I get a sniff out the 'sino at the casino
Stacking more chips than a whorehouse at Reno
So cover the peephole, don't want a sequel
Behind death's door, some horrible people
Bingo, bango, it takes two to tango
Where in the world is Carmen SanDiego?
Danny Trejo sitting at my table with the machete he'll cut off your waif's
Rendezvous at the front of the zoo with Tigger, Piglet and Winnie the Pooh
What to do up in Kalamazoo?
Take a shit in your jacuzzi then piss in the pool
Rub-a-dub-duba, straight out the gutter
If you're looking for a good time, take my number
Mother, mother, what's for supper?
Yippee-kiow-ay motherfucker

Put another quarter in the jukebox
Put another quarter in the jukebox
Put another quarter in the jukebox
Put another quarter in the jukebox
