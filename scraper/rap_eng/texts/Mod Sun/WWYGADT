[Chorus]
Why would you go and do that?
Why would you go and do that?
Why would you go and do that?
Why would you go and do that?
Why would you go and do that?
Why would you go and do that?

[Verse 1]
I heard you talking that shit again
(I heard you talking shit)
I heard you talking that shit again
So now it's on, I'm snapping on every song
I'm back on my shit again
(yeah I am, yeah I am)
Every day I wake up
In a dream again
Oh my god, I am the man
Had the plan since the band
Now my pad, by the sand
Made 'em mad
I'm shining so hot
My bad
Getting everything I want
And Imma flaunt
Got that chronic on the scale every morning
Foreign land I'm tourin', you can see my soarin'
All that hater shit is so annoying
Keep on talking, keep it goin
I keep ignoring cause yo shit is
(yawn)
So boring
But you probably know
I got vices twice as nice as anything you ever done
I save the lifeless that is priceless
Hit me back when you've saved like, one
And it's not too late to admit that I'm legit
If you don't do it now, then you gon' regret it
I ain't knee broke or sweats
You can show love or you can just go talk shit, but

[Chorus]
Why would you go and do that?
Why would you go and do that?
Why would you go and do that?
Why would you go and do that?
Why would you go and do that?
Why would you go and do that?

[Bridge]
They don't say it to my face
But they always talkin'
(they always talkin, they always talkin)
They don't say it to my face
But they always watchin'
(they always watchin, they always watchin)
I swear
Everyone here as soon as you poppin'
(Everyone here)
I swear
Everyone here as soon as you poppin'
But I'm bout to take over, you got no option
I do that
I say, hands in the air
I bet that you that
We about to light this shit up in here
I make em do that
And if I say I'm gonna do it
Then I do that
Yeah I do that
I heard you talking that shit again

[Verse 2]
Talkin so relentless
You go back and forth like tennis
I go with it to the finish
Let me go replenish
I be like "fuck a image"
I'm exactly what they missin'
I go no competition
I'm switchin' positions
It good my decision
Is god on my top
A kid now got the vision, listen
I know they watchin' me
(I know they watchin' me)
I know they watchin' me
(I know they watchin' me)
I know they watchin' me
Papa be stalkin' me
All on my property
I got alot to be worried about these days
Cause miles be lookin' like it's a maze
And all of these shows got me super paid
But I love this life it's nothin' I would change
A1 steak 1, hot like satan
Superhero with no cape on
Patient, gonna make some
Wait until day come
I be supersonic like Payton
Now it's so obvious
There is no stoppin' this
Please tell me
How does it feel!?
I don't got a fake bone in my body
You can go ahead and say I'm not real
But

[Chorus]
Why would you go and do that?
Why would you go and do that?
Why would you go and do that?
Why would you go and do that?
Why would you go and do that?
Why would you go and do that?

[Bridge]
They don't say it to my face
But they always talkin'
(they always talkin, they always talkin)
They don't say it to my face
But they always watchin'
(they always watchin, they always watchin)
I swear
Everyone here as soon as you poppin'
(Everyone here)
I swear
Everyone here as soon as you poppin'
But I'm bout to take over, you got no option
I do that
I say, hands in the air
I bet that you that
We about to light this shit up in here
I make em do that
And if I say I'm gonna do that
Then I do that
Yeah I do that
I heard you talking that shit again

[Outro]
Yo, the more we talk, the higher I get
The higher I get
I'm a hippie
I'm a hippie
I'm a punk
I'm a punk
I'm a stoney
I'm drunk
Pass it my way
Pass it my way
Smoke
