[Intro: blackbear]
Yeah
Two, three, four

[Verse 1: blackbear]
I wanna be a champion
I wanna be best friends with Marilyn Manson and
Call my manager and tell him stop managing
Cause all the future plans they may all be cancelling then
I wanna drink so much that I can't stand up from where I'm sitting and
Do so much Coke, Dr. Pepper can't even out sniff me and
Even Santa Claus is just as real as a wrestler
I knew all my presents were in my mom's dresser
So, fuck being famous
I just wanna be hated
Fuck the generation
I just want to be sedated
Fuck being cool
Fuck the whole school
I wanna swim naked
So, I'll be skinny dipping in the summer
With nothing but a gold chain on
Screaming money ain't a thing
Everybody sing!

[Chorus: blackbear]
I'll be hanging from a streetlight
Singing out my favorite song
Singing out my favorite song
I can feel it in the air tonight
I'll be hanging from a streetlight
Singing out my favorite song
Singing out my favorite song
I can feel it in the air tonight

[Verse 2: MOD SUN]
I'm spiking everybody's Kool-Aid
Buy a couple castles and make every bum a roommate
Keep it groovy
On a two way
Living loosely
But for Juicy
In a two bay
And they loving it like who say
Yours truly
Samboozay
Stay tripping like a suitcase
Don't shoot me
Sh-shoot me
Unless it's with your camera
In that case, it's spectacular
I'm seasoned like a calendar
[?] gotta have stamina
They cleaner than a janitor
And I make em say, "Aye," like we in Canada
'Cause I wanna be a champion
I wanna pop pop pop pop
More than Hanson did want to be
I wanna be Morisette than Alanis
Then I wanna spend at least a million bucks on cannabis
Don't wanna never ever ever stop being faded
Always rolling on tongues like R's in the Spanish language
R-rrrreal shit
Bear sing the hook and make them feel the shit!

[Chorus: blackbear]
I'll be hanging from a streetlight
Singing out my favorite song
Singing out my favorite song
I can feel it in the air tonight
I'll be hanging from a streetlight
Singing out my favorite song
Singing out my favorite song
I can feel it in the air tonight

[Outro: blackbear]
I'll be skinny dipping in the summer
With nothing but a gold chain on
Screaming money ain't a thing
Everybody sing!
I'll be skinny dipping in the summer
With nothing but a gold chain on
Screaming money ain't a thing
Everybody sing!
