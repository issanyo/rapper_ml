[Verse 1]
I can feel it, but I can't see it
That fake is funny, but you never believe it till' you need it
What if I told you all along I've been tellin' you all the secrets
That I was finding ? I never tried to hide or keep it
I can feel the crystals shootin' out my body, in every angle
I can see my aura inside me, every color of the rainbow

[Chorus]
Project my soul into the sky till' only stars beside me, and let me dangle
When you stare above the clouds, the sun is always shining, they become the same note
Gotta get away, get away, but I'm okay
Sometimes I gotta get away, get away, but I'm okay
But I'm okay

[Verse 2]
Now I'm a goner, it's just me and my mama
Been a while since I've seen anyone paintin' like Picasso
So I find myself alone searchin' for nirvana
It's a long road you gotta' conquer all kinds of monsters
I ? third eye, sits between two temples
Temples were created when times were way more simple
It still blows our minds, but technology tripled
I think that the answer lies between two temples
Instead of cry, I write to these instrumentals
Since a child, I could see all of the symbols
Instead of fight, I'd rather write to instrumentals
I think that the answer lies between two dimples
I never look to them to find my information
I study myself and understand the constellations
Astroprojection, constantly conversation
My body just a vessel, but my soul is worth saving

[Chorus]
Project it up into the sky till' only starsbeside me, and let me dangle
When you stare above the clouds the sun is always shining, it becomes the same note
Gotta get away, get away, but I'm okay
Sometimes I gotta get away, get away, but I'm okay
But I'm okay
