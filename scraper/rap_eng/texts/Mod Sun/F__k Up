[Chorus]
Cause I'm a fuck up, and I'm so fucked up
And all these voices in my head won't shut the fuck up
Cause I'm a fuck up, and I'm so fucked up
And it's 5PM and I just woke the fuck up

[Verse 1]
And I'm sorry but I promise I hate me more than you do
Post another fucking lie on YouTube
Pick that shit apart and tell me who's who
But that's the life and style that I'm used to
Gained some fame and now they wanna use you
Shits so fucking crazy, what the views do
It's like I gotta lose me or I lose you
But that's the life and style that I'm used to

[Chorus]
Cause I'm a fuck up, and I'm so fucked up
And all these voices in my head won't shut the fuck up
Cause I'm a fuck up, and I'm so fucked up
And it's 5PM and I just woke the fuck up

[Verse 2]
And I'm sorry but I can't even live in the moment
Worry bout another Twitter moment
Make the whole world my opponent
And they wonder why I'm never focused
And they wonder why I'm always smoking
And they wonder why I'm fucking broken
Film me, twist my words, I'm a [?]
Post it when I'm dead and I'm frozen

[Chorus]
Cause I'm a fuck up, and I'm so fucked up
And all these voices in my head won't shut the f-
Cause I'm a fuck up, and I'm so fucked up
And it's 5PM and I just woke the fuck up

[Outro]
Cause I'm a fuck up
And I'm so fucked up
Cause I'm a fuck up
Yeah I'm so fucked up
