Everyday it feels like a shopping spree to me
Cuz I be here summon ticket there's no stopping this for me
I don't care if no mother fucker I'm out here stompin' feet
I don't care if no mother fucker I'm out here stompin' my feet

Roll up
Back to chopping this beat
Hold up, guess what

You see me and all my peeps it's like we make a hole the way
Every other week
I'm bout to go bout to fuck property
Start a country where we only spread peace yeah
And fuck you if you think it's corny
All my idols died on this channel to do this shit properly
Make 'em proud of me yeah
Talking to Janice, Jim, Bob and Jimmy
Y'all don't understand that's my guy, so when you see me drinking whisky
Hopping trains doing drugs, on my mind for seven days
I'ma bend seven ways, it's like not the fucking same
I don't pill pop no I LSD drop
I drop mushrooms up inside the teapot
I don't fake meditate, no, deep thoughts
I don't want talk unless we talking deep thought
Any caddy color orange only got two doors
Had my own first check fuck my rent I wanna flex
I know I do it so damn no one nags me
Everyday now all these people trying to text me

Back to chopping this beat, hold up
Guess who hasn't slept in like a week
Roll up
Back to chopping this beat
Hasn't slept in like week
Roll up
Back to chopping this beat

They be looking for me long time
They don't even like me no more
I feel like the world is all mine
They be looking for me long time
They don't make them like me no more
I feel like the world is all mine
Walk up at the store they don't mind him at the door
I get it popping not just on the weekends
I can talk about myself I never I'm just not conceded
Rolling with my crew I think it's safe to say it's BB season
Everyday we happy baby yeah we be don't need a reason
Only Hollywood go through ounces of that good on the daily
And when I bounce out of town I go through pounds that they mail me
I've been coming down I know me and marijuana got married
And all the people tryna break us off, I swear you don't scare me
It's my side tell the gully and perry
Down for whatever don't tear me
Stab the pialics shadows is great
When the licks king is buried
Try with no bad knives near me
I do not like them clearly
Like 'em gotta be so jury
I mean it from the bottom of my heart sincerely
Like 'em gotta be so jury
I mean it from the bottom of my heart sincerely

They be looking for me long time
They don't even like me no more
I feel like the world is all mine
They be looking for me long time
They don't even like me no more
I feel like the world is all mine
