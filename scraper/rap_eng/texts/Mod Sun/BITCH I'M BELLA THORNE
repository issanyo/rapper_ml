[Intro]
Are you ready?
(You needa work more, bitch)
Bitch, bitch, I'm Bella Thorne
(What? Damn)
Bitch, I’m Bella Thorne
(This is my shit)
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne

[Verse 1]
I don't need no ID ’cause I'm Bella Thorne (Bella Thorne)
Seen me on TV a million times before (times before)
Been inside the club since I was hella short (hella short)
Now my money talk, that shit you can't afford (can't afford)
I don't got a license, but I got a Porsche (got a Porsche)
Yeah, I got some drivers that open my door (open my door)
Pussy scuba diver, need a surfboard
Let me show my nipples, what I need a shirt for?
Bitch, you need to learn more
I'm only 20, and a queen
By the time I'm 23, I'll probably be the king
Every guy that I meet tryna give me a ring
I say, "Get down on your knees, and eat the whole damn thing!"

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ll be back when (back when), I feel like it
I just hit low (just hit low), ’til I book that trip
When I rap is the only time that I spit
Yup, that's some dirty shit, B, haha
But I gotta admit
(Bitch, I’m...)

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne (bitch, I'm Bella Thorne)
Bitch, I’m Bella Thorne
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne (bitch, I'm Bella Thorne)
Hey, bitch, I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne (bitch, I'm Bella Thorne)
Work more, bitch
Bitch, bitch, I'm Bella Thorne, what?
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne (bitch, I'm Bella Thorne)
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne (bitch, I'm Bella Thorne)
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne (bitch, I'm Bella Thorne)
I should be freaking up, but I'm hella bored

[Verse 2]
Wake up in the morning and I feel so godly
Look into the mirror and say, "I love my body"
Everybody dancin' on me, think that I'm zombie
I do lots of things, but none of them are a hobby
One night, got some more security in the lobby
'Cause everywhere I go, I'm guaranteed paparazzi
I'm not tryna front, you see me riding shotty
So paparazzi, make sure you get good shots of me
I be taking shots on my car, I'm so crazy
I hear MOD SUN, he said "I'mma happybb" (Bella)
All I ever known, I've been tellin' myself
And if I have a wish I'd be like nobody else

[Bridge]
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne
Wait hold up, hold on, get out of my studio (bitch, I'm Bella Thorne, bitch, I'm Bella Thorne)
Come on, I'm tryna record over here (bitch, I'm Bella Thorne, bitch, I'm Bella Thorne)
I don't know how they don't know me!
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne
Yes, bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be back when (back when), I feel like it
I just hit low (just hit low), 'til I book that trip
When I rap is the only time I spit
That's some dirty shit, B, haha
But I gotta admit
(Bitch, I'm...)

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne (bitch, I'm Bella Thorne)
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne (bitch, I'm Bella Thorne)
Hey, bitch, I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne (bitch, I'm Bella Thorne)
Work more, bitch
Bitch, bitch, I'm Bella Thorne, what?
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne (bitch, I'm Bella Thorne)
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne (bitch, I'm Bella Thorne)
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne
Bitch, I'm Bella Thorne (bitch, I'm Bella Thorne)
I should be freaking out, but I'm hella bored

[Outro]
Yes, bitch
