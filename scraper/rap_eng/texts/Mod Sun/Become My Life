This road has become my life
Oh, I gotta get it out, gotta get it out
The darkness in my life
Oh
This road has become my life
Oh, I gotta get it out, gotta get it out
The darkness in my life

I've had the world, I turned it down
Know my place, I've worn the crown
But still I refuse to turn it around
I feel the cold, it creeps up slow
From the rush of no control
Some comin' fast, some comin' slow
Somehow this gets old

Rollin' stone
From the moment that I stepped out
On the ground it grows some roots eventually branch out
Make some goals
Fuck the rookies and pros
Nearly sold my damn soul at the crossroads
Chapters told, pages and bookmarks
Made it down every street without being book smart
Head in the clouds
I stray from the thunder
The distance between up and under is what

This road has become my life
Oh I gotta get it out, gotta get it out
The darkness in my life

Is it a question, why we chase a certain feeling of suggestion
Don't let that shit become a feeling interrupted
By the sound of thinkin' outloud, done too much good overall to not act proud
First round, I can't even kick it, last taste
Almost let the clouds think it
Change up and buy your man new perspective
Only thing that saved me from having to learn another lesson

This road has become my life
Oh, I gotta get it, gotta get it out
The darkness in my life
Oh this road has become my life
Oh I gotta get it out, gotta get it out
The darkness in my life
