[Verse 1: Mod Sun]
I need a stoner girl
(That's what I need)
I need a stoner girl
(MOD SUN)
And we get high, high, high, (Yo)
I said I'm looking for a girl who can smoke like I do
Does what she wants, not what she has to do
She's got a piercing and even got some tattoos
And you can bring her everywhere because she's mad cool
No strings attached, keep it casual
And when you don't text back she don't get mad at you
She keep it chill, don't never cop an attitude
Even when I disappear out in Malibu
And she smell like kush and Chanel
Keep her pipe in her purse right next to the lipgloss
Carry a scale, but she don't sell
Straight chillaxin' get high as a tip top
Non stop I would swap this chick if she wasn't the one I wanted to kick it with
Big shot, got her own spot never slip got a friend with benefits
Spark the pot in the parking lot
Get lit always always gotta roach clip pshhhhhh
And when I need her we'll be..

[Chorus 1: Pat Brown]
Staying up 'til dawn cause cause we talk all night blowin' smoke in the wind
Watching the sun rise...
I need a stoner girl
We run all day in the summer heat gettin' high with you and it feels so sweet
I need a stoner girl
We'll get high, high, high
We'll get high, high, high
We'll get high, high, high
We'll get high, high, high

[Verse 2: Mod Sun]
She crack a Swisher open with her manicure
Finger nails twisted up, perfect every time
And she never fails, give the whole meaning of high fashion females
And she's taking bigger hits than me
Green eyes surrounded by red
Got a feather in her hair, silk scarf on her head
Aviator glasses and turquoise rings
And she prefers to wear beads over bling, bling
Ring, ring when she hit me on my cellphone
She try to match, how the hell can I tell her no
She picks me up in the old school hoopty
I hop in the front seat and shot gun a doobie
So if you wanna come and take a cruise with me
We can smoke a couple L's in the back seat
Oh we ain't go no time to waste cause it's almost 4:20

[Chorus 2: Pat Brown]
Staying up 'til dawn cause cause we talk all night blowing smoke in the wind
Watching the sun rise...
I need a stoner girl
Play and run all day in the summer heat getting high with you and it feels so sweet
I need a stoner girl
We'll get high, high, high
We'll get high, high, high
We'll get high, high, high
We'll get high, high, high
We'll get high, high, high
We'll do it high high high high
Stoner girl
We'll do it
High high high
Stoner girl

[Verse 3: Mod Sun]
She likes the way that I sag my pants that I used to play in bands
And she likes the way I think I can dance
She likes that I'm always smiling and hardly ever silent
She likes the way I never resort to violence
She like it when I'm free styling so she beat box
She gots rhythm and got me free willin' like bob dylan
But it's still no girlfriend til' I make a million
