When everything seems lonely and I'm feeling out of place
I go to my favorite restaurant and let a newspaper hide my face
And I run away
Yeah, I run away
I order myself a coffee even though I hate the taste
So I pour some whiskey in it
And get drunk in a public place
And I run away
Yeah, I run away
As the morning becomes afternoon
And the drugs start to fade
Instead of being human
And face all the choices that I made
I'd rather run away
Yeah, run away

(Chorus)
Now I'm getting older
I should probably start thinking about my health
Try to talk to the man in the mirror
But he's never any help
He just runs away
Starting to lose it (x2)
Starting to lose myself
Starting to lose it (x2)
Starting to lose myself

(Verse)
When everyone is soft asleep
I'm alone with my best friends
All I ever needed was the voice inside my head
But I run away (Oo)
I run away
One day I'll be gone
And all you'll have is the words I said
That's why I stay awake at night
Every time I look at my bed
I just run away
Yeah, I run away

(Chorus)
Now I'm getting older
I should probably start thinking about my health
Try to talk to the man in the mirror
But he's never any help
He just runs away
Starting to lose it (x2)
Starting to lose myself
Starting to lose it (x2)
Starting to lose myself
Starting to lose it (x2)
Starting to love myself

Now I'm getting older
I should probably start thinking about my health
Try to talk to the man in the mirror
But he's never any help
He just runs away
Starting to lose it (x2)
Starting to lose myself
Starting to lose it (x2)
Starting to love myself
Starting to lose it
Starting to love myself

Starting to lose it (yeah yeah, yeah oh)
But I'm starting to love myself (Oh)
Starting to lose it
Starting to love myself
Starting to lose it
And I'm starting to love myself
