[Intro]
I don't think they understand
I'm just tryna be the man
When you livin' how I'm livin'
You do everything you can
I don't think they understand
I'm just tryna be the man
When you livin' how I'm livin'
You do everything you can

[Chorus]
Don't wanna wake up, I stay up
With all of my friends
I'm might just post my address on the internet
I think I invited every girl in my DMs
I bet my neighbors gonna have to call the cops again
I don't really care, they got no hair on they head
Always asking me why my eyes so red
Probably 'cause I'm higher than the grateful dead
(When you livin' how I'm livin'
You do everything you can)

[Verse 1]
Tie-dye my sky till the day I die
I just hit a peak, but still
I think I'll spread my wings and learn to fly
Yeah, my fault but at least I tried
It's one thing that you can't deny
Ask me if I had some more, I mighta' lied

[Bridge]
I got a secret stash underneath my mattress
That shit gon' keep me up doin' backflips
I'm so high I can barely traffic
So I don't wanna have to do the ad libs

[Chorus]
Don't wanna wake up, I stay up
With all of my friends
I might just post my address on the internet
I think I invited every girl in my DMs
I bet my neighbors gonna have to call the cops again
I don't really care, they got no hair on they head
Always asking me why my eyes so red
Probably 'cause I'm higher than the grateful dead
(When you livin' how I'm livin'
You do everything you can)

[Interlude]
I don't think they understand
I'm just tryna be the man
When you livin' how I'm livin'
You do everything you can
I don't think they understand
I'm just tryna be the man
When you livin' how I'm livin'
You do everything you can

[Verse 2]
Tie-dye my sky til' the day I die
I don't wanna play, I just wanna think
By how much I love my life
Roll the, roll the, roll the, roll the dice
It's gon' be alright
I know I say I got nothing to hide
I mighta' lied
[Bridge]
I got a secret stash underneath my mattress
That shit gon' keep me up doin' backflips
I'm so high I can barely traffic
So I don't wanna have to do the ad libs

[Chorus]
Don't wanna wake up, I stay up
With all of my friends
I might just post my address on the internet
I think I invited every girl in my DMs
I bet my neighbors gonna have to call the cops again
I don't really care, they got no hair on they head
Always asking me why my eyes so red
Probably 'cause I'm higher than the grateful dead
(When you livin' how I'm livin'
You do everything you can)
