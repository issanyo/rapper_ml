[Intro: Mod Sun]
Yeah, my son
Sam Scott, you my dough
Leedz Edutainment
They play the background, we play the lead, haha
From Minnesota to Boston and back
Yeah
M-O-D S-U-N Hippie Hop
Woodstock, let's go

[Verse: Mod Sun]
First of all, no throwaway verses
Everything we write be pretty and incursive
For myself, no need for research
Sounds outta west, but even nice and in person
Yeah, welcome to the ashtrack
Saw time, our turn, better pass that
Any hesitation, I'mma grab that list
And heard you cannot match that
Now everybody wanna ride with the hippies
On a road downtown the city
When I'm gone, but the world gon' miss me
Haven't heard music this real since 60's
This feel like histories, come get with me
Be seen in the rearview
Don't fear, you don't hear, you don't wanna be near
You know I'm to fog the clear view
Uh, and I'm a slice of paradise
Kamikaze move men for the paralyze
Double take every time they stare twice
And still keep it shaking like a pair of dice
Who'da thought Minnesota packed this much culture
What this about, sure?
All around the globe all because of my flow
Now everyone know I'm outture
Gotta Sweet 16, ain't talking 'bout birthday
Impecable rhyme all the time on my mind
Yeah, I'm hungry and I'm thristy
So I sit [?]
My vision never been more clearer
Never aim shotgun, I steer, uh
And the more I hear
Ain't nobody better comin' out this year
My son

[Chorus: Sam Scott]
We get around on the good lust
We get around 'cause we act right
We get around 'cause we positively own them Minnesota nights
We get around

[Hook: Sam Scott]
We get around, around, around
We get around, we get around
We get around

[Verse: Sam Scott]
Can you hear that sweetness in my voice?
Come some and a soul of joy
Midwest is the best to be from
Twin Cities is the home I love
My soul's been composed
Of a frozen land of love
From a place of ice and snow
All the way to Boston
My heart in the life of dreams come alive
I hope you realise
I'm tougher than the frozen ice

[Chorus: Sam Scott]
We get around on the good lust
We get around 'cause we act right
We get around 'cause we positively own them Minnesota nights
We get around

[Hook: Sam Scott]
We get around, around, around
We get around, we get around
We get around

[Verse: Mike Dreams]
(Mike, Mike, Mike Dreams)
I get around like P-A-C
When I flow AC, man, they know that's me
And they know I run the game like I know A.P
And we spit firm like I know AZ
Or Cormega, don't know the real Norega
But they can't tell me nothing
'Cuz I am God's favorite
On this side of the dimension
Couple things I ain't mentioned, pay attention
Stop!  Collaborate and listen
Mike is back with a brand new invention
Taking 'em to school, I don't need lectures
I will go Lector, all up in your sector
Hopping on a spaceship with the M-O-D
Headed for his first last name, watch we OD
To this Hippiy Hop movement, music to move with
MUSIC2DREAM2
Yeah, that's my team, too!
Tryna get a show in Saint Tropez
But I'll even settle for San Jose
Put the pedal to the medal
Crash land on stage, pull strings like a Mandolin
Illin', out here chillin' with the new Bob Dylan
And I'm Morris Day
Oak Tree, now there goes The Time
Sam Sam, bring us back to the chorus, ay!

[Chorus: Sam Scott]
We get around on the good lust
We get around 'cause we act right
We get around 'cause we positively own them Minnesota nights
We get around

[Hook: Sam Scott]
We get around, around, around
We get around, we get around
We get around
