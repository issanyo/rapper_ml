Lost my phone last night
But I don't wanna dial up GIGI, no no
Guess I've tried a lot
But no pills, no needles in me, no no

And now dance, people only talk when they do cocaine
And now dance, people getting high to get away

Lost my phone last night
But I don't wanna dial up GIGI, no no
So, I just, I just make-believe
That this world needs me
Now dance, everything I do seems so cliche
And now dance, I'm getting high to get away

Oh-oh ooh
Oh-oh ooh
Oh-oh ooh
We've always been called
We've always been called
Oh-oh ooh
We've always been called
We've always been called

Bless my soul on fire
I just wanna dial up GIGI
Bless my soul on fire
I just wanna burn my demons or my gods

We still dance at the smoke up by cigarette
On an island in Barcelona
We were getting high to get away

Oh-oh ooh
Oh-oh ooh
Oh-oh ooh
We were getting high to get away

Oh-oh ooh
We've always been called
We've always been called
Oh-oh ooh
We've always been called
We've always been called

Face down in my back
Clutching my child
I don't wanna let go
Nowhere left to go

Still got some tides spell
Still I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I know it's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair
But I am with you
