(Verse 1)
I think they need some more of that “savin lives music”.
Well I speak it fluent, where the truth is never truent
Any judgement go & lose it
Inspire, bet I do it
Hippy Hop please don’t confuse it
With them bitter sweet symphonies
I could light the world with my energy
One day in California this girl gave me a letter
I ain't never met her but she told me I impacted her forever
I opened up the note, couldn’t believe the words inside
One of my songs stopped her from committing suicide
Whats more important than the plaques & awards.
Worth more than any money could afford
Is the fact you makin people wanna stay alive
Be a set of floaties when these people start to take a dive
And this rate they might rename me “fate”
Replace the word “persevere” with a MOD SUN mixtape
The steps that I take, concrete
Yeah they retrace & relate to anybody on a path to enlightened states…

(Chorus)
Heard you were headed down the wrong road
Head spinnin like a cyclone
So I'mma do what I came to do & teach you all a thing or two
And get you on your way back home

(Pat Brown)
You’ll start to feel better when surround yourself with people
Who will never oppress to impress
You’ve gotta believe in every dream you see
While your observing concept from your sheltered bed
You already know, you already know…
So why’s there a question, what is it here for
You’re in control, i’m letting you know…
So don’t let go, no don’t let go
And this rate they might rename me “fate”
Replace the word “persevere” with a MOD SUN mixtape
The steps that I take, concrete
Yeah they retrace & relate to anybody on a path to enlightened states…

(Bridge)
I stay heavy on the throttle steady missin every pothole
It’s our time to strike, got lightning in a bottle.
