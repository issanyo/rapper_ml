Lookin' down at my hand that shit look beautiful
I got red and green all over both my cuticles
Got a hand full of that good shit that's the usual
And I swear it look like Christmas everywhere I go
Chillin' with my baby eatin sushi rolls
Always smokin' on the gas with me there ain't no intervals
Middle finger fresher than your whole bag of clothes
I walk up in the spot they like
"Boy, let me see those Gucci Nails"

I got myself a Gucci nail, I got myself a Gucci nail
If you a boss mother fucker go and get that Gucci Nail

They walk up in the spot and ask them
"What's up with that Gucci Nail?"
That Gucci Nail, oh yeah I want that Gucci Nail
I'm fresh out the salon, yeah I got myself a Gucci Nail
A Gucci Nail? Gucci nail, oh yeah I got a Gucci Nail
A Gucci nail, oh yeah I got a Gucci Nail
A Gucci nail, oh yeah I want that Gucci Nail
A Gucci nail, oh yeah I got a Gucci Nail
If you a boss mother fucker go and get that Gucci Nail

They say that like me I already knew that you like me
I'm never nervous and so I never be biting
I'm a hot boy I feel like Juvi in the 90's
Looking so icey I feel like Guwop would like me
I got Gucci on my nails, might put that Gucci on my toes
Hold up, wait, I just looked and I got Gucci on my toes
I just went out and got Gucci for my bros
If you ain't got Gucci nails we be like "what are those? Ew"
Hold up hold up hold up all my G's got the double G
Best believe even in the streets got that Gucci Nail
Pull up, pull up, pull up, red and green right next to my ring
You know what I mean, my whole team got that Gucci Nail

Hold up, hold up, hold up
I'm bouta roll up, roll up, roll up
They sayin that we bouta blow up
(We gonna pull up, pull up, pull up with that Gucci Nail)
If you a bad chick then go and get that Gucci Nail

They walk up in the spot and ask them
"What's up with that Gucci Nail?"
That Gucci Nail, oh yeah I want that Gucci Nail
I'm fresh out the salon, yeah I got myself a Gucci Nail

They walk up in the spot and ask them
"What's up with that Gucci Nail?"
That Gucci Nail, oh yeah I want that Gucci Nail
I'm fresh out the salon, yeah I got myself a Gucci Nail
A Gucci Nail? Gucci nail, oh yeah I got a Gucci Nail
