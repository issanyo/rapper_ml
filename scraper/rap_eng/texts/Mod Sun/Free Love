[Verse 1]
Got my vibe right
Everybody gettin fucked like it's prom night
It's that high life
We gon' keep on living like nobody gon' die tonight
Yeah, we gon' shine bright cause we all stars now
Officially affiliated, we who's in charge now
I'm pullin strings like guitar now
You better run to the bar now
Tell 'em we need 100 shots and then 100 more
And tell the DJ drop, my song about to hit the floor
And turn the music up
Turn the music up, turn the music up
Turn the music up, turn the music up

[Chorus]
Tonight it's all about free love
So let me know if you got some
And if you leaving with someone
Then let me knowwwwwww
Tonight it's all about free love
So let me know if you got some
And if you leaving with someone

[Verse 2]
It's all about free love
People all around me got them signs saying "Free Hugs"
I'ma, I'ma hippy everybody got free drugs
But I don't pop no pills but I can fuck with them free nugs
Hell yeah, I'm a weed head
Spend a lot of time, gettin high on a bean bag
Twist up a zig-zag, switch on a lava lamp
And that's that, you'll be high off my contact, FACT
Jack Daniels and Kerouac, mix 'em up together
You get me, now how rare is that?
Future, no I'm not scared of that
Cause I see myself all up in it
New beginning, won't stop, we'll start winning

[Hook 1]
So let's take all our secrets and blow them to pieces
And right now we'll start over, yeah right now we'll start over

[Chorus]
Tonight it's all about free love
So let me know if you got some
And if you leaving with someone
Then let me knowwwwwww
Tonight it's all about free love
So let me know if you got some
And if you leaving with someone

[Hook 2]
What's ya life like? Fuckin' awesome
What's ya life like, what's ya, what's ya life like?
Fu-fuckin' awesome. Fu-fuckin' awesome
What's ya life like, what's ya, what's ya life like?
Fu-fuckin' awesome. Fu-fuckin' awesome

[Hook 1]
So let's take all our secrets and blow them to pieces
And right now we'll start over, yeah right now we'll start over

[Chorus]
Tonight it's all about free love
So let me know if you got some
And if you leaving with someone
Then let me knowwwwwww
Tonight it's all about free love
So let me know if you got some
And if you leaving with someone
