Snippet

â€¦ on my neck like a hundred
I look down, oh wait, it's actually a hundred
Dollar bills, bitch please
[?] is that I'm a girl
I'm a, I'm a hoe, too
Double tappin' till the phone get loud, too
All I gotta do is clap-clap-clap

All I gotta do is make it clap-clap-clap
Man I don't know you like that
You're a hoe, ew
I just wanna shake my a-a-ass
I wish I could do that
I'm a hoe, too
