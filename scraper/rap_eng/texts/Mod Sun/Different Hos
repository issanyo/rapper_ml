[Verse 1]
Got a chick named Samantha, she only fucks in the morning
Then she gon' make breakfast, she know the deal, you know the story
Got Jessica, she drive a Lexus truck, she only come through at night
She got her man too, so we play it cool, gotta keep it on the side
Oh

[Chorus]
Got different hoes everywhere I go
Got different hoes everywhere I go
Got different hoes everywhere I go
Got different hoes every...

[Verse 2]
My next girl my ex girl, gotta keep this shit moving
Got two girls to do threesomes, Got four times the groupies
Got a Emily, got a Stephanie, Got a chick on both coasts
There's Monica she got a black range, Sarah drive a ghost
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Got different hoes everywhere I go
Got different hoes everywhere I go
Got different hoes everywhere I go
Got different hoes everywhere I go
Got different hoes everywhere I go
Got different hoes everywhere I go

[Verse 3]
Man I love them porn stars from the valley
I love them little snobs from Beverly Hills
I'll fly one in for the weekend
And maybe fuck around with my ex girl, still, just playing
Maybe not, but I'm alright
If you want to bring a friend thatâ€™s all right
And popped on P for Mimosas
I got all different kinds of hoes, yeah

[Chorus]
Got different hoes everywhere I go
Got different hoes everywhere I go
Got different hoes everywhere I go
Got different hoes everywhere I go
