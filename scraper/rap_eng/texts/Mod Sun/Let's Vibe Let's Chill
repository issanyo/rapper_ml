Let's vibe, let's chill
Get high maybe pop some pills
Let's drink 'till we fall out
Don't be shy, let it all out
Girl tell me what's up we can party it up
Because tonight girl I just want to stay alive
Stay alive

[Verse 1: Mod Sun]
Man you ain't never got high until you got high with me
Vibe inside the ride I got the finest energy
And we can roll around a [?] or we can roll around an E
I guarantee you feel alive I guarantee you feeling free
See there is one thing that I do mind if we celebrate
If you don't know what to do let me demonstrate
Live the moment like it's you and never hesitate
Never wait, don't worry that's just gonna complicate tonight
We just gonna run 'round once we hit uptown we gon' come down
Bring your friends see they know what's up now
See where we been now, we been living wild
So I hit up Kyle for the address once I been blessed
Pulling through with the best who be bringing no stress
Some hometown shit man we kill it with no limit
And every party need a little MOD SUN in it

[Verse 2: Kyle Coglitore]
Before we hit the town lets take a large shot
Don't gotta pick a destination we can bar hop
'Till 2 AM and after that we'll hit a frat bro
We ain't gotta worry 'bout the cops we'll take the back roads
We just started the night going all in the night
And if you can't hang you can call it a night
Or you can drink with us bring the party to life
Drink Bacardi, smoke Marley, get gnarley and hype
Who care if it's the first night and you give it up
They say this moments meant for us you should live it up
Take a hit pop a pill you'll be alright
Never do molly get happy from doing all nightys
So high I'm having conversations with the all-mighty
And we can't stop, no use to call Miley
So let's get caught up in the moment let the chemistry collide
Live tonight like tonight I just wanna feel alive
