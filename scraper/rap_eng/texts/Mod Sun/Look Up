[Verse 1: Mod Sun]
Every good story needs an intro
So where does this one start?
No veils, no curtains, no doors, no walls
Between what pours out of my hand on to the page
A dream of course
An American tale of finding magic in the everyday
And acting totally instinctively
A suitcase and a traintrack, on a search for identity
And a quality that entices attention…
We’re young and incredibly ambitious
Our possibilities are endless…
Just LOOK UP
