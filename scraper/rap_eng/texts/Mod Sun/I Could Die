Hey ya ya, now I ain't never told a lie
I'm so happy I could die
Yeah I feel so alive yeah
I'm so happy I could die
And I don't ever kill the vibe
I  ain't ever kill the vibe
I'm obsessed with my life
I'm so happy I could die

I'm so happy I could die

I'm so happy I could...

Don't even put up a fight
Everything I'm about to say to you is right
This should be new favorite song but
If it ain't you could hate go ahead that's tight

But I bet someone in the ride
Needa feel a little bit
That mod sun rhymes so
I might take a second to remind
Everybody listening
We could have all died
Last night but we didn't
We were given one more chance
To make a difference

All I know is I'm gonna get it, get it, get it
Hold it I can really spit it

But we didn't we given
One more chance to make difference
All I know is imma get it, get it, get it
Then imma split it with my team
With my girl
Then I give it to the World

And I ain't never told a lie
I'm so happy I could die
Yeah I feel so alive yeah
I'm so happy I could die
I don't ever kill the vibe
Noo, I ain't ever kill the vibe
I'm obsessed with my life
I'm so happy I could die

I'm so happy I could die
I'm so happy I could die
I'm so happy I could die

I just want y'all to understand
Life can be good even when it's bad
I've been all around the land
No plan, in a van with my friends
Still pul more bounce in the ounce
Baby that's what counts
Bounce up and down
Baby all around the town
Baby never touch the ground
Baby that's what I do, do
Where I'm sure you can tell
They gonna give me hell
I'm a wishing well
All my life I felt like I'm going to hell
Start to love ourself
Aye, but even if I didn't
I could go to bed at night, sleep tight
Gonna giving everything I got
And then she make me feel like a hundred mill
Take it away from me
And it all become foreaaaallllll

And I ain't ever told a lie
I'm so happy I could die
Yeah I feel so alive
I'm so happy I could die
And I don't ever kill the vibe
And I don't ever kill the vibe
I'm obsessed with my life
I'm so happy I could die
I'm so happy I could
I'm so happy I could die
I'm so happy I could die
I'm so happy I could die
