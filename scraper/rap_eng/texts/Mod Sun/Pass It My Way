Now I read somewhere that I spent 10 of the last 12 months on the road
Playing shows, I imagine doing your fair share of celebrating
What kinda character does that make, what kinda lessons does that teach?

Ok, um, yeah!
How time flies when your swimmin in open lines
Puttin' in so many miles, got that hop-the-boarder disorder
Sorta, afford to never live a day sober
Gettin older but still so much further from last october
Scary, very, you better listen if you wanna hear me
You gotta run fast if you're lookin to get near me
Im on my own, in the zone like meditate
You need a teamate? I cannot relate
Stay active in the city where my parents made me
To gettin hazey down in AZ with Crazy
Up in the clouds the rest were crowd pleasing
Show up do my thing every evening then Im back like last season
The cold left the rest to get lost
But not me, see im good with that defrost
Head blowin in the wind as im cruisin down the highway
So pass pass pass it my way

We drinkin' heavy gettin' wasted til we pass out
You pass it my way your boy ain't gon' back out
So pass it my way, pas it pass it my way
So pass it my way, pass it pass it my way
We drinkin' whiskey on a train headed south
You know box cars, graffiti'd out
So pass it my way, pass it pass it my way
Pass it my way, pass it pass it my way

I think I passed out
And I just woke up not knowing where I was
I'm fuckin' cashed out, i can't remember the things that i said and my friends
Now if the world ends i wanna feel like this like a destructive mess
And shots of pure bliss, I'm feelin' pure bliss

We drinkin' heavy gettin' wasted til we pass out
You pass it my way your boy ain't gon' back out
So pass it my way, pas it pass it my way
So pass it my way, pass it pass it my way
We drinkin' whiskey on a train headed south
You know box cars, graffiti'd out
So pass it my way, pass it pass it my way
Pass it my way, pass it pass it my way

We drinkin' heavy gettin' wasted til we...
You pass it my way you boy ain't gon'..

You are now healthy
