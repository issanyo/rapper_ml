[Verse]
And we got so much sun to soak up
I’m just happy that i woke up
I dream about it, & than it show up
A kid forever I ain't never gonna grow up
Bout to start a fire, smoke up
No jivin’, we vibin’
My vacation, three-sixty-five’n
Great seats nice view a the beach
Outta sight but nothin' outta reach
Cloud nine and I ain't ever goin back
Left the stress behind like. “I don’t need that!”
Live ONCE, do everything TWICE
I don’t call it life, this is paradise
You been lookin for a better way
& you know it’s not far to go
We can get away
Like “Yo, where’d they go?!”

[Chorus]
Good times, we got em on replay
They say “no” we gon do it anyway
I'ma show ya how to live like a hippy
Let me take ya down to PARADISITY
Let me take ya down, let me take ya down
Let me take ya down to PARADISITY
Let me take ya down to PARADISITY
Ok, are you happy that you woke up?
Think about it….sure enough (sho-nuff)
Love to live it, I wouldn’t trade a minute
We can hop the border I ain't got a limit
C’mon you could visit, or I could meet cha thurr
Ask me where I’m from & I say “everywhurr”
Whether it’s a train on a track, a plane or a hatch-back
We ALL over the map
Cloud nine & I ain't ever goin lower
Don’t know when I’ll be back, was nice to know ya
Lived ONCE, did everything TWICE
Life? Nah, this is paradise
You been lookin for a better way
& you know it’s not far to go
We can get away
Like “Yo, where’d they go?!”

[Bridge]
Picture the seas, picture 90 degrees
Picture the palm trees dancin in the breeze
Picture the sights that wouldn’t let you blink
Picture that ‘little umbrella’ inside ya drink, ha!
I'ma take ya there go head & say goodbye
We can float away in the high tides’
I'ma take ya there go head & close ya eyes
Ok, open up. PARADISE
