[Chorus]
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth-truth-truth I hate
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
Tell you the truth-truth-truth I hate

[Verse 1: Mod Sun]
Yeah, just when the room stop spinnin'
Huey came through with the drinks and the women
Mike hit my phone, said it's time for us to get it
So just like that, we 'bout to snap, no fitted
You know how we living, no fucks given
Tonight's on me, my hippy you ain't got it trippin'
Fourty ounce grippin', seein' double vision
Makin' up for the thirteen years of prohibition
Let me go back in, uh, yeah
And this ain't Aquafina, bro this is fire water
It's got me doin' things that I never thought of
Like searchin' for the message at the bottom of another bottle
Cause if I don't sleep, that means no hangover tomorrow
And I know, I should just stick to marijuana
But I can't lie, sometimes I just really wanna...

[Chorus]
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth-truth-truth I hate
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
Tell you the truth-truth-truth I hate

[Verse 2: Huey Mack]
I just wanna get drunk and make a few mistakes
And probably not even end up at my place
First I'll hotbox with Mod Sun at a carwash
Then I'll probably watch Mike pass out after only two shots
SIFP, yeah I'm always living
I keep living like these bitches at my shows
They just want to fuck me
But it kinda happens every time
And they always fine
And yes I, I wanna be drunk when I wake up
Grab a couple of biddies and we'll get baked up
Yeah, and you know they probably centerfolds
Pour a glass, watch 'em go down like dominos
And I don't even know where I'm a go
Drinking more Ciroc than a Rick Ross video
And I don't know where I'll wake up
I just wanna get drunk and see where the night take us

[Interlude: Mike Stud]
Uh, yeah so I'm actually gonna
Record this fucking verse
In the hotel room
Yeah buddy, swag

[Chorus]
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth-truth-truth I hate
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
Tell you the truth-truth-truth I hate

[Verse 3: Mike Stud]
This is for my jocks and the hipsters
Them chill shots and mixers
Cause we just wanna party
Have a little fun and no I'm not sorry
Cause I been drinking
But you knew that though
It's just me, Mod, and Huey on that new rap flow
And we do it for the kids who fucking relate to it
Cause we be just like you if we didn't make music
Uh, uh, uh, real shit, uh, uh, uh
Okay, I'm on a plane getting weird
I'm sorry what did you say?
I didn't hear it, I beg your pardon
I'm just too busy not giving a fuck
They always tried to bring you down when you living it up
But everybody wanna shoot the score
But don't lose your happiness on the pursuit for more

[Chorus]
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth-truth-truth I hate
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
Tell you the truth-truth-truth I hate
