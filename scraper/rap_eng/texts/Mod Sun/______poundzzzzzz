[Chorus]
I think it's time you act like you know
Everybody talkin' 'bout us; we about to blow
I can get you pounds for the low
Or I can hit you can pickin' pounds for the show
Everybody callin' on my phone
I ain't trying roll that's my whole team goal
I think it's time you act like you know
I think it's time you act like you know

[Verse 1]
Bet I got a fist full
Whips on my wrist go
I deserve a kiss tho
Woke up like "god damn
No one touchin' this flow"
I declare right now
Go ahead, get it bro
Is anybody on my level?
That would be a big "no"
Twist another cigarella
Then I'll blow a big O
The hippy in your city
It's a big show
Are they fuckin with me?
Shit, I think so

[Chorus]
I think it's time you act like you know
Everybody talkin' 'bout us; we about to blow
I can get you pounds for the low
Or I can hit you can pickin' pounds for the show
Everybody callin' on my phone
I ain't trying roll that's my whole team goal
I think it's time you act like you know
I think it's time you act like you know
I think it's time you act like you know
Everybody talkin' 'bout us; we about to blow
I can get you pounds for the low
Or I can hit you can pickin' pounds for the show
Everybody callin' on my phone
I ain't trying roll that's my whole team goal
I think it's time you act like you know
I think it's time you act like you know

[Verse 2]
Bet I'm makin' hits so long before I fly
Open up your window
Shining like a mother fucker
See me through the tints tho
I can go wherever
I'm everywhere I've been too
Been broke with my info
What you in fo'?
Where'd your mess flow
That's a whole lot of nothin bro
You can judge me all you want
Never judge another soul
Are they fuckin with me? shit I think so

[Chorus]
I think it's time you act like you know
Everybody talkin' 'bout us; we about to blow
I can get you pounds for the low
Or I can hit you can pickin' pounds for the show
Everybody callin' on my phone
I ain't trying roll that's my whole team goal
I think it's time you act like you know
I think it's time you act like you know
I think it's time you act like you know
Everybody talkin' 'bout us; we about to blow
I can get you pounds for the low
Or I can hit you can pickin' pounds for the show
Everybody callin' on my phone
I ain't trying roll that's my whole team goal
I think it's time you act like you know
(I never know)
I think it's time yo
