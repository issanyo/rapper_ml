[Intro: MAX]
Sup baby? It's Max here
Holla, holla, holla

[Verse 1: MAX]
I’m not just another man
C’mon, give your dog a bone, cat lover
I don’t think you understand
Ain’t got time for a baby

[Pre-Chorus: MAX]
I could be the best night you never have again
Or I could be your long run, the one
I could be your confidant with some benefits

[Chorus: MAX]
Ooh, I wanna do ya’ like a dream come true, yes I do, yeah
So if I’m something you could get into
Just holla, holla, holla
Holla, holla, holla

[Verse 2: MAX]
Tell me I’m you’re biggest fan
'Cause real deal, you’re a bad mother mother
Good god, I want it bad
Kitty power, baby

[Pre-Chorus: MAX]
I could be the best night you never have again
Or I could be your long run, the one
I could be your confidant with some benefits

[Chorus: MAX]
Ooh, I wanna do ya’ like a dream come true, yes I do, yeah
So if I’m something you could get into
Just, just holla, holla, holla
Holla, holla, holla

[Verse 3: MOD SUN]
We do this shit every night man, yeah, MOD SUN
Holla, holla, holla, we get what we run up
When I'm riding with my [?], we some motherfuckin monsters
You can miss me with that drama

And shout out, my hippie Max, that boy a sh-sh-shot caller
I'm a addict, she a good girl with the habits, Hollywood status
Goddamn it, I just might go get her name tatted on me
Dreamin' 'bout her on my mattress
Oh my god, my girl the baddest
I just gotta, I just gotta have it, so I holla, holla

[Chorus: MAX & (MOD SUN)]
Ooh, I wanna do ya’ like a dream come true, yes I do (Yes I do)
