[Intro]

[Chorus: Kevin Skaff]
Welcome to my life, picture the sunrise
Ooh, that's what it feel like
It's making me realize, everything's alright
Ooh, that's what it feel like

[Verse 1: Mod Sun]
I wake up and eat a Zig-Zag for breakfast
Chasing dreams got me living sort of reckless
I don't want something I'm obsessed with
So everyday I pick up right where I left it
A million thoughts in my head to put on paper
Gonna make it like a curse, I swear
Add my flavor, be out like, "later"
And see what sits behind the next door like a neighbor
Ha, I'm a traveling man
Only way I know is go, tell 'em "catch me if you can"
I've been Blowin' In The Wind ever since I heard Dylan
Now it's like, take a look at someone really livin'
Really givin' a shit about what they say
Fully enjoying every second of every day, like
Finding out right now the time's right
Feels good, huh? Welcome to my life

[Chorus: Kevin Skaff]
Welcome to my life, picture the sunrise
Ooh, that's what it feel like
It's making me realize, everything's alright
Ooh, that's what it feel like

[Verse 2: Mod Sun]
Feels like the whole world 'bout to be watchin'
Labels 'bout to be bidding like a damn auction
Gettin' compliments for my accomplishments
And praised for my positivity and confidence
God damn I love how that sounds
So I'm original, the only way I know how
Never on the ground, I get NASA high
Some think I'm cool, others think I'm out of my mind (Oh my)
Let it sink in
This the good part where we start peekin'
Eyes low, barely even blinkin'
We below, we diving straight to the deep end
Can't believe that you seein'
Swimming through a haze, I don't plan on ever leavin'
Felt too nice and it felt too right
So I stayed there; Welcome to my life

[Chorus: Kevin Skaff]
Welcome to my life, picture the sunrise
Ooh, that's what it feel like
It's making me realize, everything's alright
Ooh, that's what it feel like
Welcome to my life, picture the sunrise
Ooh, that's what it feel like
It's making me realize, everything's alright
Ooh, that's what it feel like

[Outro: Mod Sun]
It's gonna be a good day, hey
It's gonna be a good day, hey
It's gonna be a good day, hey
It's gonna be a good day, hey

[Outro: Kevin Skaff]
Picture the sunrise
Picture the sunrise
