I got fired from Old Navy
Landlord keeps on knocking I swear that he be hate me
Sleeping on this old couch but shit I ain't complaining
Cause I'm still a pimp though
Like there's moulah raining

And.. I ain't.. never.. ever been this rich ever..
And I don't even make all that much
Ask my mama for a dub and I raised her blood pressure
Now she got me working at the corner store

But I'm balling, balling
I'm so fucking awesome
Vroom! vroom! yeah that's my Camry roaring
Shit.. think the engine light just came on
Now I gotta walk fifteen miles to my apartment
But I'm balling, balling, balling
I'm so mother, mother fucking awesome
Yeah balling, balling, balling
Balling, balling, balling
Hold up
Yeah, yeah
Ohh Lord

Jump.. the... gate subway station
All the seats are taken
This kinda lifestyle teach you patience
I spent my very last savings.. on some TAKIS
I'm good to hit these cribs don't need no fancy hotel lobbies
I doubt I'll get along with my parazzi.. yeah
I just want a slim Jim and a forty.. yeah

AHHHHHHHHHH

But I'm balling, balling
I'm so fucking awesome
Vroom! vroom! yeah that's my Camry roaring
Shit.. think the engine light just came on
Now I gotta walk fifteen miles to my apartment
But I'm balling, balling, balling
I'm so mother, mother fucking awesome
Yeah balling, balling, balling
Balling, balling, balling
Hold up
