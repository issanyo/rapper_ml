[Intro]
I'ma take a Bud Light break, one minute
Ah, ah

[Chorus]
I just came down from the high of my life
I just, I just came down from the high of my life
See us popping champagne, we could do it all night
And if everything gone bad, we gon' make it alright

[Verse 1]
How you expecting them O's when you ain't put in work?
And I just got off the phone, yeah, with my realtor
And I've been eating so good that, bitch, my belly broke
And I might cop that Mulsanne 'cause, bitch, that Bentley talk
Put that sauce on that bitch real quick
Put that ice on that wrist real slick
Girl, I know you know my wallet's real thick
And I'm wonderin', wonderin' what you're drinking

[Chorus]
I just came down from the high of my life
I just, I just came down from the high of my life
See us popping champagne, we could do it all night
And if everything gone bad, we gon' make it alright

[Post-Chorus]
We don't fucking fuck with y'all, do we? (Do we?)
We don't gotta stunt on y'all, do we? (Do we?)
Bring that money back to yours truly (truly)
When I'm rocking all my goddamn jewelry, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hey, I just hopped out the foreign, looking so pretty, yeah
And yeah, that watch on my arm look like a trillion
You know that White Iverson, no, keep that jewelry tucked
And I just balled out my brain, I feel like Bubba Chuck
Girl, I'm zoned out, I feel my Xans
Ain't nobody understand
It's you and I, go and call your friends
Let's get a lot of kerosene
You gon' ride that bump-and-grind
Yeah, let me see that double-time
You ain't gotta tell them hoes because they know, yeah

[Chorus]
I just came down from the high of my life
I just, I just came down from the high of my life
See us popping champagne, we could do it all night
And if everything gone bad, we gon' make it alright

[Post-Chorus]
We don't fucking fuck with y'all, do we? (Do we?)
We don't gotta stunt on y'all, do we? (Do we?)
Bring that money back to yours truly (truly)
When I'm rocking all my goddamn jewelry, yeah

[Bridge]
Tell me, who do you call? (Who you call?)
When the night gets long (when the night gets long)
And you're sitting by the phone (sitting by the phone)
'Cause all those drugs wore off, whoa

[Chorus]
I just came down from the high of my life
I just, I just came down from the high of my life
See us popping champagne, we could do it all night
And if everything gone bad, we gon' make it alright

[Outro]
High of my life
High of my life
High of my life
High of my life
High of my life
