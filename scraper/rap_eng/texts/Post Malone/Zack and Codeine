[Chorus]
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody (Cody)
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine (Codeine)
Thirty bottles, yeah, the bill is on me (On me)
Been livin' fast, no, I can't take it slowly (Slowly)
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody (Cody)
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine (Codeine)
We on a bender, we ain't gettin' no sleep (No sleep)
We turned the hotel lobby to a party

[Verse 1]
I'm whippin' a foreign, I can't whip no Beetle (Can't whip no Beetle, can't whip no Beetle)
I rock that Saint Laurent over my beater (Over my beater)
I like to stunt like I'm Evel Knievel (Ooh)
But, it don't mean nothin' without all my people (Oh)
When I step up on stage, hands up to the sky (Hands up to the sky)
Every little thing I do, they always analyze (They always analyze)
Gave that bitch a little blow and then she come alive (Ooh, wow!)
Started dancin' on the table, like she had on mine (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't fuck with nobody (no), yeah, you hardly know me (Oh)
What you take me for (take me for), no, I can't save your soul (Oh)
I don't fuck with nobody, yeah, you hardly know me (You don't know me, know me)
Please just leave me alone

[Chorus]
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody (Cody)
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine (Codeine)
Thirty bottles, yeah, the bill is on me (On me)
Been livin' fast, no, I can't take it slowly (Slowly)
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody (Cody)
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine (Codeine)
We on a bender, we ain't gettin' no sleep (No sleep)
We turned the hotel lobby to a party

[Verse 2]
Made a hundred bands, saw all your hands out (All your hands out)
No, my friend, can't do no handouts (Do no handouts)
All these rappers, all sound the same now (Sound the same now)
Sayin' I'm to blame, now y'all see me on the TV (Ooh)
Multimillionaire by the time I'm 23 (Ooh)
Gettin' no sleep (no), ragin' for a week (Ooh)
I hit number one and I ain't even hit my peak (Ahh)
I just had to tell 'em

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't fuck with nobody, yeah, you hardly know me
What you take me for, no, I can't save your soul
I don't fuck with nobody, yeah, you hardly know me (Hardly know me)
Please just leave me alone (Leave me alone)

[Chorus]
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody (Cody)
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine (Codeine)
Thirty bottles, yeah, the bill is on me (On me)
Been livin' fast, no, I can't take it slowly (Slowly)
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody (Cody)
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine (Codeine)
We on a bender, we ain't gettin' no sleep (No sleep)
We turned the hotel lobby to a party

[Outro]
We ain't sleepin', we ain't sleepin', we ain't (We ain't sleepin', we ain't sleepin')
We ain't sleepin', we ain't sleepin' tonight (No)
We ain't sleepin', we ain't sleepin', no way (Oh, yeah, we ain't sleepin')
Pour that drink, 'cause we ain't sleepin' tonight (No)
