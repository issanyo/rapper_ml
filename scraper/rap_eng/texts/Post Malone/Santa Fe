[Verse]
I see shit in the L.A. sky
L.A. nights getting too damn high
Codeine in my blood, mud in my Sprite
Nicotine in the bud and the L.A. lights
Fuck all that shit about your human rights
I'ma make it real clear, shit black and white
I don't wanna see your face in my line of sight
Oh boy, try stuntin' on me? It don't happen
Couple Benji's stashed in that mattress
Told her back it up, she ass-backwards
Told her I'ma bring her back to my address
Told her she can have a sip of my Activ'
She gon' smoke on weed and then she gon' ash it
Told her girl, don't be gettin' distracted
Boy I pull up-up with your whore
That voodoo good so I roll it
Thirteen blunts, boy I smoke it
Thirteen life, boy I know it
Throw four in it when I'm feelin' Whitney
All this drinking is killing my kidneys
All this sip I'm sippin' gon' kill me
And motherfuckers walkin' if they ain't ridin' with me
Teeth shine in my mouth
Bad bitches all on my couch
You know it's foreign when I back out
Hit 'em with the woo-wap, she black out
Boy, I done drank so much I passed out
Hoes fall asleep and all they ass out
Boy, I done drank so much I passed out
Woke up in the spot, I'ma cash out

[Outro]
I see shit in the L.A. sky
I see shit in the L.A. sky
I see shit in the L.A. sky
I see shit in the L.A. sky
No-op
What that work, with chain got in my chain, ridin' round
Got all day, and all things the same
Only this life is my cash to fame
