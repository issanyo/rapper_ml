[Intro]
It happens every time
It sounds like suicide
I'm hesitant, but I guess I'll drink the Kool-Aid once again
It happens every time
It sounds like suicide
I'm hesitant, but I guess I'll drink the Kool-Aid once again

[Verse]
It happens every time
It sounds like suicide
I'm hesitant, but I guess I'll drink the Kool-Aid once again
It happens every time
It sounds like suicide
I'm hesitant, but I guess I'll drink the Kool-Aid once again
It happens every time
It sounds like suicide
I'm hesitant, but I guess I'll drink the Kool-Aid once again

[Outro]
It happens every time
It sounds like suicide
I'm hesitant, but I guess I'll drink the Kool-Aid once again
It happens every time
It sounds like suicide
I'm hesitant, but I guess I'll drink the Kool-Aid once again
