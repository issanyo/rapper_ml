Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

Said I wanna get with you, ayy (I wanna get with you)
Lil mama bust a move (lil mama bust a move)
Said I wanna get with you (I wanna get with you)
Ayy, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
All these jewels, I'm just flossin' (just flossin')
Plainly on my boss shit (my boss shit)
Bad bitch on my carpet (my carpet)
All white, I'm so on God shit (on God shit)
Two hundred miles, get carsick
Off a pill, feel nauseous
Ain't babysittin' these bitches

Mulsanne got her brainless (woo)
Wanna fuck? I'm almost famous (woo)
She blow this thing, get faded (woo)
Lil mama say that I'm jaded (woo)
Maybe you saw that I'm paid up
Your man, he keep you so caged up
I won't tell who you stay with
That's on everyone that I came with (I came with)

[Bridge]
You know after we done I gotta roll (I gotta roll)
You know after we done I gotta go

[Chorus]
Said I wanna get with you, ayy (I wanna get with you)
Lil mama bust a move (lil mama bust a move)
Said I wanna get with you (I wanna get with you)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh (ooh, ooh, ooh)

I'm the fuckin' man (fuckin' man)
Jumpin' out the Benz (the Benz)
Every time you see
I post these hundreds in my pants (my pants)
I'll do what he can't (I can)
Just wanna see you dance (you dance)
Do something with that ass
Girl, put something in my hands (my hands)
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Don't be shy, girl, it's okay (okay)
Real or fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (fake, fake, sake)
How much did you pay, pay, pay? (pay, pay, pay)
I'ma let you wear my chain (my chain)
Just might let you sip this 'pagne (this 'pagne)
Every single night the same (the same)
Lemme hear you say my name

[Chorus]
Said I wanna get with you, ayy (I wanna get with you)
Lil mama bust a move (lil mama bust a move)
Said I wanna get with you (I wanna get with you)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh, ooh, ooh)
