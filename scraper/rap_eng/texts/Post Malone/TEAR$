[Chorus: Post Malone]
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
That Supreme takes the pain away
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
That Supreme takes the pain away
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
What you know about me?
Y'all don't really know shit and I'm fuckin' your bitch right now (your bitch, fuckin' your bitch)
And I really really hit the Palisades right now
Supreme on my back and I'm whippin' the woo
Man, these bitches don't know, man these bitches don't know
I'm swaggin' on these hoes and I pull up in that "whoa"
And I pull up on that road, doin' hundred miles and hold
Man, I poke another hole, I smoke another O
And I pour another O and I smoke another, smoke another
Pull up on Fairfax, drop top (in the drop top)
Hop out into the 'preme store, top notch
Already bread jumpin' out the pockets
Ain't no worries, wipe my tears with my dollars, ayy

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
That Supreme takes the pain away
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
That Supreme takes the pain away
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah

[Verse 2: 1st]
Ayy, if I got an issue, I don't need no tissue (achoo, bless you)
My bitch started cryin', I bought her a Shih Tzu (woof)
You gotta do what you gotta do just to get through (just to get through)
And if you play with my money, your mom gon' miss you (R.I.P.)
I started throwin' a tantrum, so I copped me a Phantom
And every time she gets mad, I throw the keys to the Jag
Broke niggas call me materialistic (materialistic)
We do not ball the same, you're still learnin' how to pivot (still learnin' to pivot)
Ayy, since I got rich, I don't drink beer (nah)
Leave the mall, leave a trail of tears
I told my son don't have no fears
If he ever feels down, we can take off in the Lear
We could be gone tomorrow, love today (love today)
And when that check hit my account, this what I say (this what I say)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
That Supreme takes the pain away
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
That Supreme takes the pain away
I wipe my tears with the money, yeah
