[Intro]
Zaytoven
Hmm
Zaytoven
Ohh, ohh, ohh

[Bridge]
We standin' in the lobby waitin' for the elevator
We standin' in the lobby an' we can't wait to get on
Let's just go crazy, let's say, "Fuck every'"
Let's make a baby, we gon' need new laundry

[Verse 1]
Ohh, whoa, I'm on the road
Can't wait to come home to you
Ohh, I'm doin' all my shows
Can't wait to come back home to you

[Chorus]
Red wine and white sheets, pour out that Henny
I know that you love me, let's fall like we're lonely
Red wine and white sheets, pour out that Henny
I know that you love me, let's fall like we're lonely

[Bridge]
We standin' in the lobby waitin' for the elevator
We standin' in the lobby an' we can't wait to get on
Let's just go crazy, let's say, "Fuck every'"
Let's make a baby, we gon' need new laundry

[Verse 2]
I know I lied to you, that only would do you
I told you I'm sorry, you know that was not me
And that [?] was rushin' through my fingertips
I ain't never gonna go back to the man I was then

[Chorus]
Red wine and white sheets, pour out that Henny
I know that you love me, let's fall like we're lonely
Red wine and white sheets, pour out that Henny
I know that you love me, let's fall like we're lonely

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Ah, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ah, ahh, ah, ahh, ah, ahh
Ah, ahh, ah, ahh, ah, ahh
You wonder if we got that [?], [?]
You know that if we stay [?], scared to run away
You wonder if we got that [?], [?]
You know that if we stay [?], scared to run away
You wonder if we got that [?], [?]
You know that if we stay [?], scared to run away
You wonder if we got that [?], [?]
You know that if we stay [?], scared to run away
