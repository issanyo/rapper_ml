[Chorus 1]
I been waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you
One hundred bottles of the good shit couldn't even bring you back
What am I to do?
Feel like I'm circlin' a drain, all I see is the remains of an ugly truth (of an ugly truth)
One hundred models I could follow all the way to hell and back, but they can't replace you (they can't replace you)

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh

[Verse 1]
I was puttin' on for you like a jersey
What I didn't know then couldn't hurt me
Never thought that you'd go and do me dirty
Left me in the cold, but on the inside I was burnin'
But that's just the way it goes
Wish that I could have control
Everybody dies alone
(And I ain't dead yet)

[Refrain]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (a long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (guess we're losing hope)
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

[Chorus 2]
I'm still waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you (take me right to you)
One hundred vials of denial, I know they won't bring you back
What am I to do? (What am I to do?)
You’re my alibi and motive when I'm lyin' to myself, what an ugly truth (what an ugly truth)
We’re no strangers to the flame
We will never be the same if we make it through (and we can make it through)

[Verse 2]
My back is up against the wall
But I used to feel invincible
Yeah, it was us against the world
But somehow, someway, the tables turned
I remember back then
Played my cards right you were my best hand
Still you keep me guessin'
Wonder if I'll ever get the message

[Refrain]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (a long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (guess we're losing hope)
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

[Outro]
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?
