INT. SUBWAY TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

Miles races down the tunnel toward the LIGHT OF THE STATION. He HOPS THE FENCE, no hesitation.

Prowler sprints behind with INFRARED VISION!

A SUBWAY TRAIN IS COMING! Miles LEAPS INTO THE AIR and GRABS THE CEILING as the DEAFENING subway passes BENEATH HIM.

Prowler WALKS TOWARD MILES as Miles realizes his HANDS ARE STUCK! Miles swings his legs around to free himself as Prowler approaches. A nightmare come to life.

MILES: Stop sticking!

Miles somehow RIPS HIS HANDS OFF, skin tearing -- OW! -- and races out of the tunnel.

INTO THE LIGHT, clambering onto the PLATFORM, another train coming, Miles LEAPS, just CLEARING IT. He runs upstairs. Prowler watches from the SHADOWY TUNNEL, unable to follow.

SUBWAY VOICE: Stand clear of the closing doors, please.

EXT. BROOKLYN - NIGHT

Prowler whizzes through the busy streets on his motorcycle. He drives right by a hiding Miles.

Miles runs past a crowd that is gathering around the strange CLUSTERED TRAFFIC LIGHT we saw earlier(A remnant of dimensional glitching), taking photos.

BROOKLYNITE: Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.
