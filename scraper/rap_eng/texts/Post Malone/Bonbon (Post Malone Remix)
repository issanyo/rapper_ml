[Intro: Era Istrefi & Post Malone]
Un jom Era
Un jom Era, and I'm coming for the light
(I just want to...)
All or nothing
(Oh)
Now or never

[Chorus: Era Istrefi]
Coming straight from the KO
And my heart knows the way, oh
Never get in my way, oh
Sun e bon sun e bon sun e bon sun e bonbon
Bonbon, I know what you want
Bonbon, bet you wanna taste it
Bonbon, bet you wanna taste it
I know what you want, want, want
Bonbon, can you get it done, done?
Bonbon, bet you wanna taste it
Bonbon, my sip will get you wasted
I know what you want, want, want

[Post-Chorus: Era Istrefi]
Nice to, nice to meet ya
Mister, I'ma teach ya
King but you met your first Queen, ya
Nice to, nice to meet ya
Mister, I'ma teach ya
King but you met your first Queen, ya

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
The music loud, the liquor flowing, girl I'm going, yeah
I just wanna get you, get you alone, yeah
The way you move it, wanna see you out them clothes, yeah
I just want to know baby
There ain't no way in hell you going home alone, yeah
No less, no stress, undress, I put it on ya
Can you keep going on until the break of dawn? Yeah
I just want you
Is you listening to what I say? Ayy
And we in bed but we ain't gonna lay, ayy
And baby know that I ain't scared of that, ayy
I wanna ride, and ride and ride and yeah, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2: Era Istrefi]
Bounce to the rhythm while we pour some more
'Cause my time has come and I'm bossy
Them wanna, wanna flex with us
'Cause we higher than the limit, high and mellow
Ooh, all the lines we crossin'
Ooh, the drama we be causin'
So sick like we got that flu
I'ma switch it up, my hair turn blue

[Chorus: Era Istrefi]
Coming straight from the KO
And my heart knows the way, oh
Never get in my way, oh
Sun e bon sun e bon sun e bon sun e bonbon
Bonbon, I know what you want want
Bonbon, bet you wanna taste it
Bonbon, bet you wanna taste it
I know what you want, want, want
Bonbon, can you get it done, done?
Bonbon, bet you wanna taste it
Bonbon, my sip will get you wasted
I know what you want, want, want

[Post-Chorus: Era Istrefi]
Nice to, nice to meet ya
Mister, I'ma teach ya
King but you met your first Queen, ya
Nice to, nice to meet ya
Mister, I'ma teach ya
King but you met your first Queen, ya
(Honey)

[Outro: Era Istrefi]
Sunday night, I put a light in my blunt right
In my blunt right
Spending dough til we all go broke that is our M.O
Let it go if you wanna ride
Gonna be alright
