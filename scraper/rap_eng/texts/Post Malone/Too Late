[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Feel like ain't nowhere to run
Fight until they say "it's done"
Chances, I ain't never had one
That's on everything I love
Hate, I ain't never had none
Nowadays, I can barely see the sun
We're waiting on the day I come
Live until they take my lungs away

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
You don’t want it bad enough
You don’t want it bad enough
You don’t want it bad enough
You don’t want it bad enough
Took my chance when I had one
Standin', lookin' mad in the club
Spendin' like we don't give a fuck
Hundred, hundred Benz off the jump

[Chorus: Post Malone]
It's too late to slow down
It's too late to slow down
It's too late to slow down (yeah)
It's too late to slow down

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
I feel like I'm livin' to lose
Who the fuck gon' fit in my shoes?
I been patient for twenty years, put some respect when I move
Truth status won't be denied, I got no chances to lose
Dues, pay them now, got credit with a bunch of spectators  confused
The muse, tell 'em there ain't nothing better
That was feeling underneath the weather
I'll just hit it to you, they were six
Underwater, where is your umbrella?
Tell 'em I was only here to do it better
Than the ones who said I couldn't make it (make it)
Even if I don't, I gotta get position
So a sucker nigga couldn't take it

[Verse 4: Post Malone]
Yeah
I'm in H-Town, bumpin' and sippin'
Man, the purple shit is slowing down my vision
Why you mad, 'cause my roof gone fishing
Ain't a single problem with the way we're living
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn
Every single second just to burn the sand
We done did that shit that you done said we can't
So when I pull up on my Lambo my door slam
On that ass
Fuck what all the childs say
And my wrist cold now, ayy
And it's just a start, ayy
But I can't slow down, slow down

[Chorus: Post Malone]
It's too late to slow down
It's too late to slow down
It's too late to slow down (yeah)
It's too late to slow down

[Verse 5: Post Malone]
Everybody want to know what I meant, cuh
Show up in the Vanni when the bitch tore down
Champagne always coming, I just pour it all out
I don't like the taste, I just know you in a drought
Bet it all out, let it all out
What was shorties name? Can't remember right now
Can't remember what you said when you was talkin' down
Tell me, how much did I spend? Can't remember right now

[Bridge: Trae Tha Truth & Post Malone]
Don't come around, if you ain't down
Play around, get lay down
A hundred rounds, a hundred rounds
You know that, you're outta bounce

[Chorus: Post Malone]
It's too late to slow down (It's too late)
It's too late to slow down (It's too late)
It's too late to slow down (Yeah)
It's too late to slow down

[Outro: Trae Tha Truth & Post Malone]
Don't come around, if you ain't down
Play around, get lay down
A hundred rounds, a hundred rounds
You know that
