[Intro: Post Malone]
Ohh, huh
Ohh!

[Chorus: watt]
Baby, got the beat that won't stop, the feeling gets stronger
Baby, got the hand that keeps feeding me, no more hunger
Get high, get lost in paradise
This feeling's all we got tonight
Baby, I'm a burning man, baby
Burning man, baby

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Ayy, I felt something I never had before
I'm paranoid, I keep peeking out the peephole
On the mother ship, sippin' on some Pinot
In the mirror, I seen a list of people
I sped off and landed in Nevada
What happened next just don't really matter
Can't take everything, seems so scattered
Takes hold of my breath, oh, like asthma
Hey, and I'm all out of tequila
And me and lil' mama drop more acid than a Beatle
I'm trippin' too hard I had to ditch out on the dealer
Hop in the El Dorado, I'ma see you se√±orita

[Chorus: watt]
Baby, got the beat that won't stop, the feeling gets stronger
Baby, got the hand that keeps feeding me, no more hunger
Get high, get lost in paradise
This feeling's all we got tonight
Baby, I'm a burning man, baby
Burning man, baby

[Verse 2: watt]
I didn't want it, but fuck it, I guess I'm really in it
My blood is rushing, my heart is going a mile a minute
My Mr. Mojo is rising, forever 27
I say hello to heaven, yeah yeah
Five days in and I lost my soul
All these women and all these drugs
Find myself when I lost control
Who knew a bad trip could be beautiful?

[Chorus: watt]
Baby, got the beat that won't stop, the feeling gets stronger
Baby, got the hand that keeps feeding me, no more hunger
Get high, get lost in paradise
This feeling's all we got tonight
Baby, I'm a burning man, baby
Burning man, baby

[Instrumental Breakdown]

[Chorus: watt]
Baby, got the beat that won't stop, the feeling gets stronger
Baby, got the hand that keeps feeding me, no more hunger
Get high, get lost in paradise
This feeling's all we got tonight
Baby, I'm a burning man, baby
Burning man, baby
