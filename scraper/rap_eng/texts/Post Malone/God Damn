[Intro: Post Malone]
God damn, god damn
Yeah, ooh, god damn
Yeah, god damn

(Good job, First)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
God damn
Where the hell you get that from?
Saucin' on them hoes 'cause that ass so dumb
Everyone here wanna hit that yum
Yeah, yeah, god damn
Where the hell you get that from?
Saucin' on them hoes 'cause my ice so dumb
Everyone know 'bout my bread, got some
Yeah, yeah, god damn

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Bustin' out the, hoo hey (woah)
I just keep on blastin' out the pussy and
God damn, bustin' out the, hoo hey, uh
I just fucked my bitch, rockin' St√ºssy, yeah
Ooh, drop a modicum of sauce
She really ain't shit, bitch, I dropped it all off
Hit the strip club and blow it all off top
'Cause I will never love a damn ho in my life

[Chorus: Post Malone]
God damn
Where the hell you get that from?
Saucin' on them hoes 'cause that ass so dumb
Everyone here wanna hit that yum
Yeah, yeah, god damn

Saucin' on them hoes 'cause my ice so dumb
Everyone know 'bout my bread, got some

[Verse 2: 1st]
(Ayy, it's 1st, haha
You know what I do, hold up)
Okay, I pulled up, dropped the top
Everybody looking, wonder who I am (who?)
She get out, ass big
Everybody looking like, "God damn"
And she say she want a nigga who
Can handle everything with other men (that's me)
Then she topped me off and turned around
Said, "Take it daddy," so I went Super Saiyan (huh)
Flavor last forever, any bitches know you weak (lame)
I'm so in love with making money that I can't sleep
Excuse me, sir, can I have my sauce back? (Please)
Tryna run off with my sauce, you need to bring it back

[Chorus: Post Malone]
God damn
Where the hell you get that from?
Saucin' on them hoes 'cause that ass so dumb
Everyone here wanna hit that yum
Yeah, yeah, god damn
Where the hell you get that from?
Saucin' on them hoes 'cause my ice so dumb
Everyone know 'bout my bread, got some
Yeah, yeah, god
