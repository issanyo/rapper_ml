[Intro: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Let me tell you a little story
Hey girl, love me

[Verse 1: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
In the middle of a cold dark night
I heard a sound and I thought to myself, "What was that?"
I got up and checked
It was you walking out my door
You said you loved me just moments before
Why'd you lie?
What the heck?

[Chorus: Post Malone as Leon DeChino & Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff]
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?

[Interlude: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Let me introduce you to my friend, Jazzy Eff

[Verse 2: Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff &  Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Don't you know my friend would do anything?
He would sing to you from winter to spring
You betrayed him
You should go away
He really, really, really misses you bad (Yes he does)
He remembers all the times that y'all had
He's crying (I'm crying)
That's not okay

[Chorus: Post Malone as Leon DeChino & Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff]
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?

[Bridge: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
Stop, girl, what have you done?
You used to be sweet just like bubblegum
Now you are no fun
You suck, you broke my heart
Stop, girl, what have you done?
You used to be sweet just like bubblegum
Now you are no fun
You suck, you broke my heart

[Chorus: Post Malone as Leon DeChino & Jason Stokes as Jazzy Eff]
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?

[Outro: Post Malone as Leon DeChino]
So tell me, why, girl? Come on
