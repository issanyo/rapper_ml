[Chorus: Post Malone & Zack]
I just touched down in JFK, oh my God
That skunk smelling like a fake, ayy, oh my God
She bust it open like a AK, oh my God
In a fleet of phones, they can't find me, no
My diamonds shining, my diamonds shine, oh my God
My diamonds shining, my diamonds shine, oh my God
Squad out here really 'bout it, oh my God
Motherfucker, they can't find me, no

[Verse 1: CokeBoy Zack]
We the shooters from the other side
Colder figures, know they down to lie
Colder cases, we ain't never switch
Hoes love the way the Rollie fit
Pussy niggas, they ain't relevant
Park you niggas for the hella shit
Push a foreign, sippin' medicine
Fuckin' hoes, nigga hella rich
Know that I live by the code
Know that I die for my woes, oh my God
Really in the feel, really in the trenches nigga, oh my God
Tryna lock the door and broke the hinges
Out the window and it's weather-stained
Got my shooter in a Honda Civic
Gun you down, you should really live it
Niggas murder for that scene though
Been tryna give a nigga recall
Ask your bitch, nigga, she know
Whole clique full of deebos
Really rich off that econ'
36 for the kilo
You a killa, yeah, we know
Oh my God

[Chorus: Post Malone & Zack]
I just touched down in JFK, oh my God
That skunk smelling like a fake, ayy, oh my God
She bust it open like a AK, oh my God
In a fleet of phones, they can't find me, no
My diamonds shining, my diamonds shine, oh my God
My diamonds shining, my diamonds shine, oh my God
Squad out here really 'bout it, oh my God
Motherfucker, they can't find me, no

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Oh my God, I'm trapped in the system (God)
Fuckin' on bitches, they twin sisters (twins)
We not the same, we were born realer (no)
I got the part like the rapper nilla (ooh)
If she fuck me first, she get the fame quicker (mad)
You think Hollywood gon' get your name bigger? (nope)
I represent for the gang members (gang)
I represent for the gang members (gang)
Pick your poison, pick your poison (poison)
I got more ducks than Oregon (brr)
Pick your poison, pick your poison (brr)
Babies on me, no orphan
Oh my God, I feel important (important)
I'm getting accustomed to having orgies
Remember, I came home, we got a new house phone that's cordless
Now I pay my mama's mortgage (mama)
Then she say, "Oh my God, you really work hard
I'm proud of you son, you really work hard"
I'm on my job, I'm on my job (ayy, ayy, ayy)
And when I make it to the top, I promise I'm never gon' fall (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Chorus: Post Malone & Zack]
I just touched down in JFK, oh my God
That skunk smelling like a fake, ayy, oh my God
She bust it open like a AK, oh my God
In a fleet of phones, they can't find me, no
My diamonds shining, my diamonds shine, oh my God
My diamonds shining, my diamonds shine, oh my God
Squad out here really 'bout it, oh my God
Motherfucker, they can't find me, no
