[Intro]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, woah
Ayy, ayy, ayy, woah
Mhm

[Verse]
And everything is all cool, until I say it's a go
They talking all the shit
They said that I would not reach my goals
I kept on going for sho’
But they don't know it, I know
She said she wasn't with the shits, I told her to stay in the cold, ayy
I ain’t got the time to paint the sign for you, ayy
But it's okay, don't wanna fight with you, ayy
Put a couple thousand on the side for you, ayy
Hop up in the 'Rari, take a ride with you
Shit was jumping, I grabbed the shotty
I swung my door fully open
And then I close it
Then lead the party
Bitch, it coming, it keep on coming
And I ain't post it, but I show it
I let you know it, and now I own it (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when I had a dream I pull up in the 6?
Remember when they said Young Posty wasn't gon' be shit?
Remember I was starving, hungry? Ain't no way to live
Shit, everything is different now

[Chorus]
When I step up on stage, this shit go up
Yeah, I blow a bitch brain when we show up
Yeah, bitch the whole squad on the glow up
I remember we was nothin’, now they know us
Seem like every damn night that we pour up
All these bands right now, I’ma blow 'em
Yeah, bitch the whole squad on the glow up
I remember we was nothin’, now they know us
Yeah, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when I had a dream I pull up in the 6?
Remember when they said Young Posty wasn't gon' be shit?
Remember I was starving, hungry? Ain't no way to live
Shit, everything is different now

[Chorus]
When I step up on stage, this shit go up
Yeah, I blow a bitch brain when we show up
Yeah, bitch the whole squad on the glow up
I remember we was nothin’, now they know us
Seem like every damn night that we pour up
All these bands right now, I'ma blow 'em
Yeah, bitch the whole squad on the glow up
I remember we was nothin', now they know us
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, woah
Ayy, ayy, ayy, woah
