[Intro]
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
I never thought that it would hit this hard
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
I never thought that it would hit this hard

[Verse 1]
Don't do that, I tell you so
Don't overdose, like no, no, no
Oh my God, what have you become?
The traces of you, no, I can't see them
What have you become? What have you turned to?
What have you taken? Like someone hurt you
You drink that mixture, that shit gon' hit you
No, I can't fix you, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Oooh, yeah
I ran through, yeah
I feel a change in the air tonight
I saw myself in a different light
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
I never thought that it would hit this hard
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
I never thought that it would hit this hard

[Chorus]
I just keep running and running and running around
I never thought that it would hit this hard
The feeling is different instead when you wake on the ground
I never thought that it would hit this hard
I don't know who I was in and I don't know anymore
I never thought that it would hit this hard
In the city, we sinning, we don’t ever want to come down
I never thought that it would hit this hard

[Verse 2]
Me and J take over and we way up
Now high above the city of angels
Smoke a boge in the sky, pass the fuego
I already dropped something in the Faygo
Only came to the club 'cause they paid us
Take this shit and lemme see what you made of
No sleep, little mama, we gon' stay up
Vampires on a night in Las Vegas

[Pre-Chorus]
Oooh, yeah
I ran through, yeah
I feel a change in the air tonight
I saw myself in a different light
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
I never thought that it would hit this hard
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
I never thought that it would hit this hard

[Chorus]
I just keep running and running and running around
I never thought that it would hit this hard
The feeling is different instead when you wake on the ground
I never thought that it would hit this hard
I don't know who I was in and I don't know anymore
I never thought that it would hit this hard
In the city, we sinning, we don’t ever want to come down
I never thought that it would hit this hard
I just keep running and running and running around
I never thought that it would hit this hard
The feeling is different instead when you wake on the ground
I never thought that it would hit this hard
I don't know who I was in and I don't know anymore
I never thought that it would hit this hard
In the city, we sinning, we don’t ever want to come down
I never thought that it would hit this hard
