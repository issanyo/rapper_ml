[Verse 1]
She said, "Love me" so I love her
She said, "Leave me" so I left
Then I went to California
And I ain't never comin' back
I got a high five from a brother
I got bloodstains on the bed
And I ain't sayin' that I love her
But this bitch is gonna drive me mad
I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Chorus]
You got just what I been looking for
But you can't bring yourself to say no
And I ain't never gonna let you go
I kept wishing I would die, oh
The whole plane ride home
And I wish I could
I know I should leave you alone

[Verse 2]
I worship since I met you
I fell down to my knees
And when no one would accept ya
Throw myself up on a cross and bleed
I seen a dark cloud coming over
I seen some evil shit in her head
But she rode me like no other
But this bitch is gonna drive me mad
I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Chorus]
You got just what I been looking for
But you can't bring yourself to say no
And I ain't never gonna let you go
I kept wishing I would die, oh
The whole plane ride home
And I wish I could
I know I should leave you alone
You got just what I been looking for
But you can't bring yourself to say no
And I ain't never gonna let you go
I kept wishing I would die, oh
The whole plane ride home
And I wish I could
I know I should leave you alone
