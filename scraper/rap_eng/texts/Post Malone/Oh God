[Chorus]
Oh God, oh God save me
No I ain't gonna die for my baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
20 dollars, keeping me eating
Might just eat the apple from the garden of Eden
The way she call my name, the way she call my name
The way she call my name, I pray I'll be the same

[Chorus]
Oh God, oh God save me
No I ain't gonna die for my baby
Oh God, oh God save me
Ain't no love for the ones who betray me
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, ayy

[Verse 2]
Drop top, horses run, power steering
Drive like hell to get away from this feeling
The way she call my name, the way she call my name
Try take my soul away, yeah, bitch, make my day

[Chorus]
Oh God, oh God save me (oh wow, wow, wow)
No I ain't gonna die for my baby (oh wow, wow, wow)
Oh God, oh God save me
Ain't no love for the ones who betray me
