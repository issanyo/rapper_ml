Part 1: Hollywood Dreams

[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, ahh
Ah, ah, ah, ahh
Woo, woo, ayy

[Verse 1]
I'm in a four-door down Rodeo
I'm getting fucked up, I'm losing control
I'm bumping Fleetwood, she tryna turn off my song
She keep asking where the party at
I got a flask full of vodka in my passenger seat
My homie got a mansion says that we could crash it for free
We gotta take the phones because we can't let nobody see
We pop a pill since you ain't have not a thing to eat, oh, oh, ooh

[Chorus]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
And players only love you when they're playing, ayy
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

[Post-Chorus]
You will know
You will know
You will know
You will know, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
'Cause I got dreams, don't hold me down
So I'ma let you free, don't wanna hold you out
I'ma leave when the sun comes

[Chorus]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
And players only love you when they're playing, ayy
Say, women, they will come and they will go

[Interlude]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Part 2: Come Down

[Chorus]
I thought that I would learn by now
I thought that I would never come down (I would never come down)
Just last night we was going so hard (so hard)
But now I can't feel my heart
And yeah, let me down easy, don't let me down rough
Don't let me go to sleep, getting up is gon' be tough
They was all actin' sleazy, they all said I was the one (I was the one)
And with any damn luck, I'ma wake up with the sun
Hope I wake up with the sun this morning, oh
I hope I wake up with the sun this morning, oh

[Verse]
And let it pour, let it pour, let it pour, let me roll
Man, I'm on a roll, I'm so up in my zone
They thought that I was fuckin' done with Iverson
But I'm still ballin' on these bitches, let 'em know
I just want everything, I want it all in advance
They just want me call it quits
Homie, just roll up a cig
Lil Posty don't fuck with y'all
Never been fuckin' with y'all
We pull up, they standing in awe
Yeah, your bitch, she know who we are

[Chorus]
I thought that I would learn by now
I thought that I would never come down
Just last night we was going so hard (woo)
But now I can't feel my heart
And yeah, let me down easy, don't let me down rough
Don't let me go to sleep, getting up is gon' be tough
They was all actin' sleazy, they all said I was the one
And with any damn luck, I'ma wake up with the sun
Hope I wake up with the sun this morning
I hope I wake up with the sun this morning
