[Intro: Post Malone]
Yeah, yeah
You get down on the porch
Slow it down for me
Baby, what's up?

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Like what's up? Ooh
What's up with that, what's up?
Tell me what's up with that, what's up? What's up? Ooh
What's up with that what's up? What's up, up, up, up?
Like what's up? Ooh
What's up with that, what's up?
Tell me what's up with that, what's up? What's up? Ooh
What's up with that, what's up? What's up, up, up, up?
What's up with that, what's up?

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
What's up with that what's up?
I'm tryna talk, just fuck up (fuck up)
Quit fuckin' with them buzzards (buzzards)
I'm tryna call your number (brrrr)
You've been playin' way too long (playin' way too long)
I've been smokin' on that strong
In the studio too long
Blowin' on that horn
I'm just tryna get that on, woah
And I ain't tryna stunt man, I'm tryna be honest
And the style, that's swag, bitch, you know I be on it (ooh, ooh)
I get you what you want, I get you what you want (you know that I will)
With that Christian Louboutin, I get you that shoe on (you know that I will)
You a shoo-in for first place (ayy)
But I'm feelin' so blue, ayy
And I'm sippin' a forty (oh)
She keep playin' like Blu-Ray (oh)
Drop the top on that toupee (skrrt)
And I might cop that today (skrrt)
But I need me a you-day (oaky)
And I'm just tryna hit it (woah), we could go up on a Tuesday (like Makonnen, like Makonnen)
And I'm tryna fuck, why you playin' with me? (Why, why, why, why, why)
Why you playin' with me? (Why, why, why, why, why)
Girl, I'm tryna call your number, tryna call your number

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Like what's up? Ooh
What's up with that, what's up?
Tell me what's up with that, what's up? What's up? Ooh
What's up with that what's up? What's up, up, up, up?
Like what's up? Ooh
What's up with that, what's up?
Tell me what's up with that, what's up? What's up? Ooh
What's up with that, what's up? What's up, up, up, up?
What's up with that, what's up?

[Verse 2: 1st]
What's up with the what's up?
Line goin' crazy
I got two phones, one an I, one a flip
That's the one all the flips hit (haha, hello?)
She call me when she wanna do the gymnast shit
I got her doin' somersaults, Gabby Douglas backflips
So when's the last time you seen a big dick?
She said she like to kiss 'cause I got big lips
And we got all that chemistry
She show me images
Pop a bean, now we limitless
You ain't gotta be real, baby, we could just pretend, aw
I got her coughin' and wheezin' every time I pass her the indo
Aw, goddamn, bruh, all this sauce
Keypad, unlock, then she pop her top (brrp)
Girl, pick up the phone when I call you
1st down, touchdown, I'ma go for two on you
I ain't tryna put the pressure on you
I got girls from here to Arizona
Like what's up

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Like what's up? Ooh
What's up with that, what's up?
Tell me what's up with that, what's up? What's up? Ooh
What's up with that what's up? What's up, up, up, up?
Like what's up? Ooh
What's up with that, what's up?
Tell me what's up with that, what's up? What's up? Ooh
What's up with that, what's up? What's up, up, up, up?
What's up with that, what's up?

[Outro: Post Malone]
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now, look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now, look at me now
The reason why I tell you what's up
Baby, don't you know that's what's up?
