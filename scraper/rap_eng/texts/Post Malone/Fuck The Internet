[Intro]
A-yeah-yeah-yeah (ohh)
Woah-oh-oh
A-yeah-yeah-yeah

[Verse]
I just seen lil' mama Instagram an' she flexin'
Don't care about your puppies, just that ass and them breastses
Oh girl, you a model? Damn, I never woulda guessed it
An' if you tryna throw out all them vibes, I'ma catch 'em
The lifestyle we live is just too dangerous
Paranoid since they've been leakin' my shit
Wonder if it'll come out on the web
An' I can't help all these bitches on my dick
Takin' a photo an' postin' that shit
Comin' home late an' I crawl into bed
She always be askin' me, "Where have you been?", woah

[Pre-Chorus]
The world has gone to shit an' we all know that
People freakin' out, like, hit the Prozac
Leon DeChino shows got all the blogs mad
Well, fuck the internet, an' you can quote that, woah

[Chorus]
It's a lot; well, if ignorance is bliss, then don't wake me up
An' I'll prolly be the last to know
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more
It's a lot, and they try so hard just to fuck shit up
An' I'll prolly be the last to know
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
It's a lot; well, if ignorance is bliss, then don't wake me up
An' I'll prolly be the last to know
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more
It's a lot, and they try so hard just to fuck shit up
An' I'll prolly be the last to know
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
