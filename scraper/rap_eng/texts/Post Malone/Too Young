Like I'm cash out, eat at Pappadeaux
Flowin' on to the Galapagos, runnin' and grab the dough
Man, this shit never minimal, feel like an animal
Yeah, bitch, I tryna keep me cool (tryna, tryna)
'Cause I ain't never goin', never goin' back, uh (tryna never)

Ayy, whip fast, my bitch bad, I skrrt, skrrt, that coupe fast

Just watch me go, bitches, they watchin' me go (whoa)
Walkin' around, ayy, I pick that band up
And then I go drop that shit off (oh)
Pull up in a Porsche, shit poppin' off
Pop that shit off, I got that bitch off
I tell her to knock that shit off and I got my nut off
And she washed my nuts off, ayy
