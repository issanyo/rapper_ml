[Intro: Post Malone]
Might be talkin' to you

[Verse 1: Dynamite Dylan]
The sun comes out when you smile
See stars in your eyes at night
Never thought holdin' your hand
Could make everythin' alright

[Refrain: Dynamite Dylan]
Now you stay on my mind
Message me all the time
Used to watch TV all alone
Now I don't mind you by my side

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
If it started with a moment, turned into a feelin'
A feelin' that nobody can explain
Might be talkin' to you
Might be talkin' to you

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause when you come around
Always feel them butterflies
Something that nobody can explain
Might be talkin' to you
Might be talkin' to you
Might be talkin' to you
Yeah, might be talkin' to you
Yeah, might be talkin' to you

[Verse 2: Dynamite Dylan]
Your heart keeps me on a beat
The secrets that you tell me, I'll keep
Your energy is motivatin'
Always keep me on my feet

[Refrain: Dynamite Dylan]
Now you stay on my mind
Message me all the time
Used to watch TV all alone
Now I don't mind you by my side

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
If it started with a moment, turned into a feelin'
A feelin' that nobody can explain
Might be talkin' to you
Might be talkin' to you

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause when you come around
Always feel them butterflies
Something that nobody can explain
Might be talkin' to you
Might be talkin' to you
Might be talkin' to you
Yeah, might be talkin' to you

[Bridge: Dynamite Dylan]
Never thought I could feel like this
It's a feelin' that I can't resist
Just wanna be with you, it's like nothin' else matters
And I hope that you feel the same too

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
If it started with a moment, turned into a feelin'
A feelin' that nobody can explain
Might be talkin' to you
Might be talkin' to you

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause when you come around
Always feel them butterflies
Something that nobody can explain
Might be talkin' to you
Might be talkin' to you
Might be talkin' to you
Yeah, might be talkin' to you

[Outro: Post Malone]
Might be talkin' to you
