[Intro: Post Malone]
Ooh
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Bitch I came up and I don't know
I don't know where I go tomorrow
Bitch I came up and I don't know
I don't know what's gonna come tomorrow
Bitch I came up and I don't know
I don't know where I go tomorrow
Bitch I came up and I don't know
I don't know what's gonna come tomorrow, yeah

[Drop: Post Malone]
I don't know what's gonna come tomorrow
I don't know what's gonna come tomorrow, yeah

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Don't bother, bitch don't bother
I just left the mall balling hard like Jordan (swish)
Out in Fairfax, I was smoking Marlboro
Bitch we so high, bitch I'm high as Ayatollah
Bitch I'm three high, bitch I'm high as Ayatollah
She don't want that white coca', I ain't talking soda
Bitch ask me, "Do you love me?", I'm like, "What I told ya?"
As I woke upm I was smoking on that strong again
That forty keep it funky, I keep it funky
Man, I'm smoking on that potent, that's unimportant
I just wanted her to fuck me, need her to fuck me
And she just want all of my money, all my fucking money

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Bitch I came up and I don't know
I don't know where I go tomorrow
Bitch I came up and I don't know
I don't know what's gonna come tomorrow
Bitch I came up and I don't know
I don't know where I go tomorrow
Bitch I came up and I don't know
I don't know what's gonna come tomorrow, yeah

[Verse 2: Key!]
I don't even worry about tomorrow
It might be some money, it might be a ho, okay
I don't where I'ma be tomorrow
Might be counting dough, in bed with your ho
Okay, her nose keep running and the money keep coming, hey
I'ma keep balling, hey, Rucker Park Spalding, hey
Carefree, I've been living carefree
So much kush in the air, we can barely even breathe
I rarely worry about things I don't know
You say I'm living wrong, you ain't wrong, money long, ayy
So think about it, it ain't nothing I don't know
All the money that I saw, I don't think I'm ever wrong

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Bitch I came up and I don't know
I don't know where I go tomorrow
Bitch I came up and I don't know
I don't know what's gonna come tomorrow
Bitch I came up and I don't know
I don't know where I go tomorrow
Bitch I came up and I don't know
I don't know what's gonna come tomorrow, yeah

[Drop: Post Malone]
I don't know what's gonna come tomorrow
I don't know what's gonna come tomorrow, yeah
