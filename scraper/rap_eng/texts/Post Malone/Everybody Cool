[Chorus: Mike Stud]
I know we gon' make it, I know, I know we gon' make it
Everything will be okay
I know we gon' make it, I know, I know we gon' make it
Yeah, everything will be okay

[Refrain: Post Malone]
Everybody cool, everybody cool, everybody cool, everybody cool

[Verse 1: Mike Stud]
Yeah, I'ma go off when I walk in this bitch
She wanna fuck me I know what it is
She know all these dudes in here they all the same
Yeah, I got some fucks that I don't wanna give
But I got one waiting on me at the crib
'Cause all these bitches in the club, they all the same
Just be yourself, don't catfish
You're faker than your captions
These bitches crazy bat-shit
Nah, I don't fuck with that shit
She fly like Vince on the Raptors
These guys would bend over backwards
But she lying on my mattress
And she lying like a mattress
You can't miss me with all of that
(?)
Then she begged me to call her back
She came for me I'm off the mat
Can't slow down
In too deep, up too late, out of town
We can't stop we're too high off the ground

[Chorus: Mike Stud]
I know we gon' make it, I know, I know we gon' make it
Everything will be okay
I know we gon' make it, I know, I know we gon' make it
Yeah, everything will be okay

[Refrain: Post Malone]
Everybody cool, everybody cool, everybody cool, everybody cool

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
