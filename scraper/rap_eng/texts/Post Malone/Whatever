[Intro]
Hahaha

[Chorus]
I wear whatever the fuck I want
I do whatever the fuck I want
I say whatever the fuck I want
I buy whatever the fuck I want
I wear whatever the fuck I want
I do whatever the fuck I want
I say whatever the fuck I want
I buy whatever the fuck I want

[Verse]
Yeah, Melrose, six-whippin'
Six digits, bad bitches, they be dick-lickin'
Slick sippin' Pimp C with the limb missin'
Teeth glisten, kick pound, smoking loud, listen
Spend a grand on the shoes like my mind missing
Givenchy kicked up while I'm smokin' on Doja
Like Kanye, the Rover'll smash your Corolla
I'm with your se√±ora, she givin' me oral
All-black in Fairfax
It's really not fair that
Flight-club is swipe-club, I see it, I buy it
The Jordans, I wear that
Young Post, yeah, beware that
Volcano, prepare that
Hoes kicking it at the crib, asking Malone
"Can I play with your hair?", yeah (hahaha)
Uh, it keeps adding up
The money, oh God, it just keeps addin' up
The styrofoam cups always stay stackin' up
And you know that my team just gon' keep actin' up
You play me a song, please just give rappin' up
You talkin' that shit, boy, just keep that shit up
Find Post in the cut, prolly smokin' a blunt
I use all of this money to shit on you fucks

[Chorus]
I wear whatever the fuck I want
I do whatever the fuck I want
I say whatever the fuck I want
I buy whatever the fuck I want
I wear whatever the fuck I want
I do whatever the fuck I want
I say whatever the fuck I want
I buy whatever the fuck I want

[Outro]
Yeah, Melrose, six-whippin'
Hahaha
Melrose, six-whippin'
Six digits, bad bitches
Now listen, listen
