[Intro - Sample]

[Verse 1]
Woke up in a hot tub, spillin' Moet, in the water
Then I light my marijuana, take a shot up out the choppa
J's jumpin' out the locker, spend a little guapa
She want candy, Aaron Carter
I called her Candy when I saw her, pull up with my brothers
Candy-painted flyin' saucer, test me, you'll get flyin' colors

[Pre-Chorus]
Hunnid bitches comin' up the steps
Turn the front lights on, when I know they on they way
She said she don't wanna do too much drugs
Believe me, baby, I do this shit like every day, like every day

[Chorus]
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it, ayy
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it
(Stoney, Stoney, uh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Wanna talk about them Martins?
Do you wanna talk about them Jordans?
Enjoy a 40 every mornin', Everclear and some recordin'
101, on the 101 like Jeff Gordon
I just popped a pill, she just popped a pill
And we might just pop some more, I ain't stoppin' 'til like 20
Up until like 4, SmartWater like some dummies
Takin' shots up out the semi, that shit kill me like I'm Kenny

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, bitches walkin' down the steps
Turn the front lights off, got a blunt all to myself
No, I don't want all this shit to get too deep
But listen, baby, there ain't no shit with you and me
No "you and me," no

[Chorus]
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it, ayy
She don't want a thing, I don't want a thing
She come over, pop a couple beans
And that's it, and that's it
And that's it
