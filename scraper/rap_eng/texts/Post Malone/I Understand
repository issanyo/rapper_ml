[Intro: Post Malone]
Stoney Maloney

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
I don't believe it, when you say you're missing me
It feels different, when you're kissing me
So what you sayin'? If you mean it tonight
Why you playing? You're being mean tonight
I don't believe it, when you say you're missing me
It feels different, when you, when you're kissing me
I-I, I'll leave
If you don’t wanna be what we once were, I understand
I don’t wanna hold you up, if you got plans
It feels different

[Post-Chorus: Key!]
I'm 'bout to turn this car around
I'm about to turn this car around
I'm finna turn this car around
I'm about to turn this car around

[Verse 1: Key!]
It used to be bliss, now when we kiss
This ain't the same bitch, this ain't the same bitch
Everything used to be alright, it used to be alright
I saw you texting Makonnen, don't call me no more, man
You're pissing me off, I wanna be moanin'
You're making me evil, I can't do right
So tonight, I'ma take this flight
I ain't never coming back like that
When I'm on the road bitch, you can never come back
I might just get your friend, just to piss you off, you off, you off

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
I don't believe it, when you say you're missing me
It feels different, when you're kissing me
So what you sayin'? If you mean it tonight
Why you playing? You're being mean tonight
I don't believe it, when you say you missing me
It feels different, when you, when you're kissing me
I-I, I'll leave
If you don’t wanna be what we once were, I understand
I don’t wanna hold you up, if you got plans
It feels different

[Post-Chorus: Key!]
I'm 'bout to turn this car around
I'm about to turn this car around
I'm finna turn this car around
I'm about to turn this car around
