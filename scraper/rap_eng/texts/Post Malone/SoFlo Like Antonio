[Verse: Ethan Klein]
SoFlo
Where you at, boy? Where you at, boy?
SoFlo
Where you at, boy?
Yo, I'm down at South Beach, Florida
You got all the beach before ya
And just when I thought he couldn't take it any further, damn
SoFlo is my father, damn
SoFlo is my father, damn
SoFlo is my father, damn
SoFlo is my father, damn
He stole everything from me
Can you please just back off?
Just let me have my fucking snow cone
It's got strawberry syrup, it's my favorite flavor
You can fuck my whole family tree, just let me be

[Interlude: Ethan Klein]
Fuck you SoFlo! Make your own shit!
Stop stealing shit from everyone
Make your own shit, dog!
Fuck off!
(Coughing)
SoFlo is my father

[Chorus: Post Malone]
SoFlo like Antonio, SoFlo like Antonio
SoFlo like Antonio, SoFlo he even stole my flow
SoFlo like Antonio, SoFlo like Antonio
SoFlo like Antonio
