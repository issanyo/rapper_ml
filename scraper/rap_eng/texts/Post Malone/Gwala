**SNIPPET**

[Chorus: Don Ace]
Gwala, my gwala
Got my gwala, got my gwala (gwala, gwala)
Yeah, yeah, got my gwalwa, my gwala (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Uh, a-aye!

[Verse 1: Don Ace]
Ain't trippin' 'bout no murder case, what you stack that gwala for?
I don't talk to the police, what you think them lawyers for?
I got the gwala out the street, you know it's dirty
Like why the fuck you [?]
Bitch, I'm having gwala, I hit any hoe I want
She probably want the boy to cuff her, but you know I won't
I told the plug I want a pound, but I probably won't
I might just pull up--
