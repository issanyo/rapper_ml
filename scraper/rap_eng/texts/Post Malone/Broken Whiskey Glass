[Verse 1]
I done drank codeine from a broken whiskey glass
I done popped my pills and I smoked my share of grass
Slaved for the man and I broke my fuckin' back
So you can take your nine-to-five and shove it up your ass
And that 101 like the highway in hell
Going too damn fast, I spilled drink on my Chanel
And I woke up and my room's fuckin' trashed like a damn hotel
And where I go next, now, only time will tell

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh

[Verse 2]
I done spent some time chasin' women that don't give a shit
I done learned my lessons and I ain't never gon' forget
Started callin' this shit, started ballin' and shit, started flickin' that wrist
They ain't never listened, now I'm makin' them hits so I'm fuckin' your bitch
No, it ain't that difficult for me to forget that you ever exist
Bet you remember my name when I pull up in that whip that doesn't exist (skrrt)
Spill lean on Supreme last Saturday
Let that shit splash, motherfucker talk saucey
Pass me them drugs, motherfucker let me try 'em
At the White House, call my homie Joe Biden, he flyin' out weed
Smokin' my dope, Bathing Ape, that be the clothe
Man, don't be silly, that shit you rockin' is old
Like it's years since you been to the store
Feel like Meek Milly but I ain't from Philly
I'm poppin' a wheelie, I show off my grillie
I do this for real-y and for my fam-ily
Same shit every night, man, it's all so famil'-y
The bitches they killin' me
Like, bitch are you kiddin' me?
Ballin', that shit Jason Kiddin' me
You can't get rid of me
Yeah you want my chain and my chi bitch Iâ€™m real good at chemistry

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
